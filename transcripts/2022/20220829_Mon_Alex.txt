[00:00.000 --> 00:14.440]  Side, the operational phase of global, cultural and economic societal collapse.
[00:14.440 --> 00:21.000]  Senate reports, DHS reports, journalistic reports confirming millions and millions and
[00:21.000 --> 00:28.400]  millions of people walking right across mainly the Texas border now and massive human smuggling
[00:28.400 --> 00:36.600]  run by the Biden administration through NGOs, non-governmental organizations, with on camera
[00:36.600 --> 00:44.080]  thousands of children at bus stops and airports a day, children as young as six months old
[00:44.080 --> 00:49.240]  with no paperwork, not with their parents being given to other people with no paperwork.
[00:49.240 --> 00:54.640]  I read a story yesterday of a 10-year-old girl who was processed through our own government
[00:54.640 --> 01:01.160]  delivered to a family and then put in a house raped, abused and cut in supposedly the greatest
[01:01.160 --> 01:06.800]  country in the world and we have stash houses with 73 people in it, 13 kids in our nation's
[01:06.800 --> 01:09.480]  capital, I'm tired of this crap.
[01:09.480 --> 01:14.480]  Actual child kidnapping and trafficking on an industrial scale.
[01:14.480 --> 01:19.520]  I spent more than a week in Central America recently, I had the opportunity actually to
[01:19.520 --> 01:22.000]  interview a human trafficker.
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.880]  Is it easier to traffic the children and get them in than the adults?
[01:27.880 --> 01:32.640]  It's more risky because once we get to the cartels they are asking for children, for
[01:32.640 --> 01:34.960]  them to traffic with drugs.
[01:34.960 --> 01:40.240]  In the case of children, it really scares him to just see the reality that they can
[01:40.240 --> 01:47.720]  go through and for him it's pretty horrific to see how they are murdered in many cases.
[01:47.720 --> 01:54.160]  What about people that want to buy a child because they are a sexual predator?
[01:54.160 --> 02:00.280]  I've heard that some people in places have very specific things that they like, certain
[02:00.280 --> 02:03.560]  nationalities or certain age groups.
[02:03.560 --> 02:08.920]  So the cartels are looking for the people going around and when they spot someone with
[02:08.920 --> 02:13.000]  those characteristics they tend to take them.
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.640]  In most cases they wanted to sell their organs so that is the reason they take children.
[02:17.640 --> 02:19.120]  That's very hard to hear.
[02:19.120 --> 02:20.120]  How this is?
[02:20.120 --> 02:22.000]  Yes, it's very hard.
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.240]  Sometimes they take out the organs and they refill the body with drugs so they can take
[02:26.240 --> 02:27.240]  it to the border.
[02:27.240 --> 02:32.800]  Do they sell them to hospitals or to buyers, like private buyers, wealthy buyers?
[02:32.800 --> 02:39.360]  They are people with money that want to buy the organs of kids and it's not only for a
[02:39.360 --> 02:44.360]  country they take it to different countries and normally they do this with clinics that
[02:44.360 --> 02:46.440]  are not authorized.
[02:46.440 --> 02:50.240]  Absolute next level, we know the globalists are obsessed with child trafficking, obsessed
[02:50.240 --> 02:54.200]  with pedophilia, obsessed with sexualization of children.
[02:54.200 --> 02:58.840]  An anonymous whistleblower has come forward sitting down with Savin Hernandez who works
[02:58.840 --> 03:05.440]  as a travel youth care worker for a federally funded contractor and shares the tens of thousands
[03:05.440 --> 03:11.760]  of unaccompanied migrant children so two to five thousand a week are being bust and flown
[03:11.760 --> 03:16.720]  throughout the United States and handed off to quote unvetted adult sponsors.
[03:16.720 --> 03:22.560]  The employee and she actually gives us the name MVM Inc. said the company's main focus
[03:22.560 --> 03:27.800]  is getting unaccompanied minors from quote point A shelters to point B sponsors across
[03:27.800 --> 03:29.160]  the United States.
[03:29.160 --> 03:36.600]  We need to understand that we are looking at an operation of not only human trafficking
[03:36.600 --> 03:39.520]  but in this case, child trafficking.
[03:39.520 --> 03:43.800]  For those of us in the audience who might not know what MVM Inc. is, can you explain
[03:43.800 --> 03:46.520]  to us what your company is and what they do?
[03:46.520 --> 03:54.960]  It's a company that focuses on getting, they call youth youths unaccompanied children, unaccompanied
[03:54.960 --> 04:01.080]  minors, getting them from point A to point B and most of the time point A is from the
[04:01.080 --> 04:10.680]  shelter all up to Texas and all across the country and point B is with a sponsor.
[04:10.680 --> 04:15.880]  Most of the time it's a family member but maybe the numbers are still crazy, there's
[04:15.880 --> 04:23.600]  no longer family members, it's family friends, people who are willing to take them in and
[04:23.600 --> 04:26.480]  a lot of the times they don't even know each other.
[04:26.480 --> 04:31.160]  So if you could give us an estimate how many children per month you think are being moved
[04:31.160 --> 04:33.680]  just in the Texas area.
[04:33.680 --> 04:40.760]  Like I said, it's between all the offices, it's in the thousands, I say eight to ten
[04:40.760 --> 04:47.160]  but that's in one week so in a month I would say around 40,000, 30,000 kids.
[04:47.160 --> 04:53.240]  30 to 40,000 children a month being given away to Perfect Strangers with no record.
[04:53.240 --> 05:01.320]  This is Jeffrey Epstein Island on Warp Speed.
[05:01.320 --> 05:06.560]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular
[05:06.560 --> 05:12.160]  system, for your brain, for every part of your body but what I don't see being promoted
[05:12.160 --> 05:18.520]  is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects.
[05:18.520 --> 05:19.520]  It certainly does for me.
[05:19.520 --> 05:25.960]  When I take a couple of these capsules an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing.
[05:25.960 --> 05:31.680]  Now there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain
[05:31.680 --> 05:36.360]  but I want you to experience it yourself, we know it's good for your heart, we know
[05:36.360 --> 05:40.040]  it's good for your brain, we know it's good for your arteries and veins and your lungs
[05:40.040 --> 05:44.520]  and every other function of your body but I want you to experience this high grade fish
[05:44.520 --> 05:49.800]  oil, this ultimate fish oil at InfoWareStore.com and see what it does if you take it before
[05:49.800 --> 05:50.800]  bed time.
[05:50.800 --> 05:56.520]  Ultimate fish oil, 50% off, now exclusively available at InfoWareStore.com.
[05:56.520 --> 06:26.360]  Thank you all for your support, you're only going to miss out if you don't get it.
[06:26.360 --> 06:31.080]  Well it's now official being announced everywhere, irreversible collapse of civilization as
[06:31.080 --> 06:38.360]  we know it, there's no reversing it, it's already begun but we can mitigate it and we
[06:38.360 --> 06:44.960]  can bring those that orchestrated it to justice because if they're able to collapse civilization
[06:44.960 --> 06:49.120]  and bring in their high tech slavery on its ashes, well then we're going to be in even
[06:49.120 --> 06:55.400]  worse place and never allowed to rebuild.
[06:55.400 --> 06:58.840]  The viewers and listeners of this tip of the spear transmission have been vindicated
[06:58.840 --> 07:03.200]  on the COVID-vax being a poison, you've been vindicated on the pedophilic nature of the
[07:03.200 --> 07:07.800]  New World Order, you have been vindicated on the fact that the government's involved
[07:07.800 --> 07:12.360]  in giant child trafficking rings, you have been vindicated on the fact that they orchestrated
[07:12.360 --> 07:17.280]  inflation by design, you have been vindicated on the fact that the Democratic Party is an
[07:17.280 --> 07:23.160]  organized crime syndicate, you've been vindicated on the fact that they're establishing a private
[07:23.160 --> 07:30.680]  corporate world government, hell bent on the end game of forced depopulation, you, the
[07:30.680 --> 07:34.520]  listeners, the viewers, the activists, the men and women of every race, color and creed
[07:34.520 --> 07:41.400]  in the arena are the vanguard of the human resistance and I salute and thank you all
[07:41.400 --> 07:45.440]  for joining us on this live Monday broadcast.
[07:45.440 --> 07:53.720]  Let me tell you what's coming up today, always on fire, always cutting edge, Dr. Lee Merritt
[07:53.720 --> 07:58.040]  joins us, medical doctor to lay out what's really happening and the fact that they now
[07:58.040 --> 08:02.380]  admit the shots are deadly poison and destroy your immune systems, we're going to be hitting
[08:02.380 --> 08:10.360]  this huge stack of mainline government reports, triple quadruple confirming that nine out
[08:10.360 --> 08:17.280]  of 10 of those dying from COVID had been triple vaxed.
[08:17.280 --> 08:21.080]  That's just some of the news and that's stuck unbelievable.
[08:21.080 --> 08:26.160]  Then we have Elon Musk and everybody else basically who's got half a brain pointing
[08:26.160 --> 08:31.600]  out the total collapse of civilization is here and we must reverse it now that the cost
[08:31.600 --> 08:35.440]  is already going to be in the hundreds of millions of dead.
[08:35.440 --> 08:39.400]  Steve Bannon says the collapse of civilization, the great reset, so destructive you're not
[08:39.400 --> 08:43.080]  going to be able to turn this around, that is exactly right and that's the new world
[08:43.080 --> 08:44.400]  order plan, unbelievable.
[08:44.400 --> 08:49.200]  The Department of Transportation declares regional emergency following British petroleum
[08:49.200 --> 08:57.720]  refinery blowing up in Indiana and it just goes on from there.
[08:57.720 --> 09:03.880]  Breaking emergency declared, Brits energy bills to soar by record 80% this winter, they've
[09:03.880 --> 09:08.600]  already soared 90% in Germany and I have the globalists in their own words bragging and
[09:08.600 --> 09:13.080]  admitting the whole plan, that's only a third of the stack, we'll be getting to all of that.
[09:13.080 --> 09:18.920]  Then incredible footage that our reporters got, that Stephen Crowder got, that others
[09:18.920 --> 09:27.800]  got in Texas of a pedo drag queen pedophile time event were anti-foreout brandishing firearms
[09:27.800 --> 09:36.640]  and threatening people so we have armed men protecting perverts wanting to engage in strip
[09:36.640 --> 09:43.960]  club activity with children, this is the end game of the new world order, we have a huge
[09:43.960 --> 09:51.120]  stack of news on that front, also the FBI arresting the folks that found the president,
[09:51.120 --> 09:57.320]  the puppet president's daughter's diary where she talks about I was molested, yes I think
[09:57.320 --> 10:04.520]  so by my father and that ties in to FBI says it routinely notifies social media platforms
[10:04.520 --> 10:08.200]  of potential threats following Zuckerberg comments that the FBI ordered them during
[10:08.200 --> 10:14.920]  the election in 2020 to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop direct government involvement
[10:14.920 --> 10:21.080]  with big tech and the coordinated censorship, that's all coming up.
[10:21.080 --> 10:27.480]  Now we also have the gun control group saying they're going to have a social credit score
[10:27.480 --> 10:32.280]  and just block via the major credit card companies all ammo or gun transactions whether it's
[10:32.280 --> 10:38.440]  Walmart or a private seller, those are big announcements in Congress, it's over Trump
[10:38.440 --> 10:43.080]  will be indicted, Yahoo News everywhere, the headline Alan Dershowitz says there's enough
[10:43.080 --> 10:48.800]  to indict Trump, Lindsey Graham predicts riots of Trump prosecuted over classified documents
[10:48.800 --> 10:56.080]  and what did Biden say on Friday, that they believe the right wing is about to engage
[10:56.080 --> 11:01.240]  in terror attacks over Trump, no we're not and look at Drudge Report, the once mighty
[11:01.240 --> 11:07.200]  Drudge Report now obviously in the hands of something like CNN, still a very interesting
[11:07.200 --> 11:17.760]  website, the Don calls for uprising, huge letters, FBI, what did I tell you what happened
[11:17.760 --> 11:23.840]  in the last year and a half with all the pre-program they were doing ahead of the election, they
[11:23.840 --> 11:31.120]  would hype that the right wing is going to engage in terror and then of course they'll
[11:31.120 --> 11:36.440]  provocateur it just like we saw it with Governor Whitmer and what happened a few years ago
[11:36.440 --> 11:42.720]  and the same FBI group ran January 6th, they ran the Mar-Lago raid, they ran the fake Russiagate
[11:42.720 --> 11:48.040]  garbage on Trump and against me and many others, the deep state knows America woke up to it,
[11:48.040 --> 11:51.800]  the deep state knows there's a political realignment, the deep state knows the people of the world
[11:51.800 --> 11:56.840]  are done with them, they know we're rejecting the great reset, from Brazil to the United
[11:56.840 --> 12:02.280]  States to Australia, so what are they going to do, they're going to stage terror attacks
[12:02.280 --> 12:07.040]  or provocateur terror attacks, that is the obvious play they're going to run, they're
[12:07.040 --> 12:12.520]  in the formation, they're ready, they got some trick plays as well but you can bet your
[12:12.520 --> 12:19.360]  bottom Benjamin Franklin, you can bet your bottom $100, $100 worth what a dollar was
[12:19.360 --> 12:29.240]  50 years ago, that in the next 71 days we're going to see some very violent fireworks,
[12:29.240 --> 12:39.240]  I would predict racially motivated mass shootings, bombings, poisonings, attacks on power supplies
[12:39.240 --> 12:45.480]  being blamed on the right wing, they intend to bring in a full dictatorship in the next
[12:45.480 --> 12:51.760]  71 days and we are all strapped to this thing, this is such a dangerous time and I would
[12:51.760 --> 12:58.280]  advise the globalist who are mid-level that think they're about to have a leftist revolution,
[12:58.280 --> 13:01.320]  the globalists don't actually plan at the higher levels to have that, they plan on having
[13:01.320 --> 13:07.920]  a civil war that brings down America and you'll be the fall guys, the left are going to be
[13:07.920 --> 13:15.280]  destroyed in this process, you're being set up and I would advise the leadership of the
[13:15.280 --> 13:20.480]  FBI and the Justice Department to use your heads and realize even though you hate America
[13:20.480 --> 13:24.200]  and even though you've been raping and robbing and stealing and narcotics trafficking and
[13:24.200 --> 13:27.960]  child sex trafficking forever and you think you're actually being given power and you
[13:27.960 --> 13:32.440]  think you're in charge, you're like Hitler with British intelligence setting him up and
[13:32.440 --> 13:36.680]  then signing a treaty with him and coming him, he was going to take over Europe and
[13:36.680 --> 13:41.520]  Edward VIII was going to be the king of the European Union and all the rest of it, you
[13:41.520 --> 13:46.240]  saw what happened to Hitler, you guys are walking into a trap that's meant to bring
[13:46.240 --> 13:50.920]  everybody down in the process, if you think cutting the energy off, you think having lockdowns
[13:50.920 --> 14:03.760]  was bad, that was just training wheels, training wheels for what is about to go down.
[14:03.760 --> 14:13.880]  It's an incredible time, an incredible time to be alive. Wow, there's just so much more,
[14:13.880 --> 14:18.080]  so much more we're going to be breaking down today. We have Joe Rogan coming out endorsing
[14:18.080 --> 14:23.120]  the Republican Party, he was led by Ron DeSantis, he had tomorrow's news today here and what's
[14:23.120 --> 14:29.400]  his reason? Trump continues to push the poison shot and of course Joe goes on to say in the
[14:29.400 --> 14:40.960]  full interview that Aaron Rodgers, the quarterback, that he would support the Republican Party
[14:40.960 --> 14:45.440]  if they had somebody like DeSantis but that Trump is too tied to the poison shot. Don't
[14:45.440 --> 14:52.000]  people see the trap Trump walked into and that he's refusing to pull out of? This is
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  a very, very, very dangerous climate we're in and we should all be focused on justice
[14:57.000 --> 15:04.280]  and peace, focused on nonviolence and focused on intellectual, cultural, spiritual renewal.
[15:04.280 --> 15:09.000]  But when we come back, I want to get into the design collapse of society and the big
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.240]  developments there. So the first clip we're going to play is the one video in my words
[15:14.240 --> 15:19.400]  everybody needs to see, that's a compilation of WEF members and other globalists making
[15:19.400 --> 15:24.360]  their transhumanist predictions about how they're going to take your bodies over with
[15:24.360 --> 15:30.840]  microchips and more. And then Steve Bannon and Elon Musk both warning that the collapse
[15:30.840 --> 15:35.960]  has already begun and if it isn't reversed immediately it's going to be beyond catastrophic
[15:35.960 --> 15:41.200]  and totally irreversible, a total collapse. We're in a collapse so it's already bad but
[15:41.200 --> 15:47.960]  it can be mitigated massively now but there isn't much time. This could not be a more
[15:47.960 --> 15:54.320]  great broadcast on this August 29th, Monday Worldwide Transmission. Infowars.com and Band

[20:43.800 --> 20:52.560]  our digital and our biological identities. In 10 years when we are sitting here we have
[20:52.560 --> 21:03.200]  an implant in our brains and I can immediately feel because you all will have implants.
[21:03.200 --> 21:10.920]  Around 2030 I would say that by then definitely the smartphone as we know it today will not
[21:10.920 --> 21:16.440]  anymore be the usual kind of the most common interface. Many of these things will be built
[21:16.440 --> 21:27.480]  directly into our bodies. FDA approved the first electronic pill if I can call it like
[21:27.480 --> 21:35.120]  that. So it is basically biological seep that it is in the tablet and once you take the
[21:35.120 --> 21:40.800]  tablet and dissolves into your stomach it sends a signal but you took the tablet. So
[21:40.800 --> 21:47.480]  imagine the applications of that compliance. The new accounting is what we call blockchain.
[21:47.480 --> 21:54.160]  It means digital. It means having a almost perfect record of every single transaction
[21:54.160 --> 22:00.080]  that happens in the economy. This new money will be sovereign in nature. Most people think
[22:00.080 --> 22:07.720]  that digital money is crypto and private but what I see are superpowers introducing digital
[22:07.720 --> 22:12.720]  currency. The Chinese were the first. The US is on the brink I think of moving in the
[22:12.720 --> 22:16.240]  same direction. The Europeans have committed to that as well.
[22:16.240 --> 22:20.960]  Where are they traveling? How are they traveling? What are they eating? What are they consuming
[22:20.960 --> 22:31.560]  on the platform? So individual carbon footprint tracker. Individual carbon footprint tracker.
[22:31.560 --> 22:40.840]  Humans are now hackable animals. The whole idea that humans have this soul or spirit
[22:40.840 --> 22:46.640]  and they have free will and nobody knows what's happening inside me so whatever I choose whether
[22:46.640 --> 22:52.240]  in the election or whether in the supermarket this is my free will that's over. Free will
[22:52.240 --> 22:53.240]  that's over.
[22:53.240 --> 23:04.480]  We are totally vindicated. The satanic mark of the beast nature of the world government
[23:04.480 --> 23:10.920]  is now out in the open and so the enemies move to silence us because they know the people
[23:10.920 --> 23:17.920]  are listening. It is their fourth industrial revolution. The domestication and annihilation
[23:17.920 --> 23:21.400]  of our species.
[23:21.400 --> 23:30.840]  You have been at the forefront of this fast implementation of the new innovative drive.
[23:30.840 --> 23:38.960]  The second difference of the first industrial revolution is that it is not just one technology.
[23:38.960 --> 23:45.600]  You say sometimes yes it's a digital revolution. No, it's not just a digital revolution. It
[23:45.600 --> 23:52.120]  is many other areas. It's brain research, nanotechnology and I could go on and on.
[23:52.120 --> 23:59.360]  The life sciences and so on. It's a fusion of the physical, the digital and the biological
[23:59.360 --> 24:06.320]  world. That's really the essence of the fourth industrial revolution.
[24:06.320 --> 24:13.520]  Now the third change is the fact that it is a systems revolution. It is not so much a
[24:13.520 --> 24:21.240]  product revolution where you bring out new products or create new services. It is changing
[24:21.240 --> 24:32.560]  existing systems. Just think of Uber or Airbnb or of shared economy. It is not a new product
[24:32.560 --> 24:39.200]  I repeat, but it's a system as such which is changed. It doesn't just change what we
[24:39.200 --> 24:48.840]  are doing. If you look at the first three revolutions, it made us more productive. It helped us to
[24:48.840 --> 24:55.440]  communicate faster, to communicate with more people, to help us in our consumption patterns
[24:55.440 --> 25:02.520]  and so on. But the fourth industrial revolution is actually changing ourselves. It's changing
[25:02.520 --> 25:08.760]  ourselves. Not only what we are doing, it's changing who we are.
[25:08.760 --> 25:13.560]  But of course the first three revolutions were pro-human and about empowering humanity.
[25:13.560 --> 25:18.960]  This is a revolution taking over all those systems. Surveiling everything to control
[25:18.960 --> 25:23.640]  everything we do and turning off the resources you're already seeing in the last year and
[25:23.640 --> 25:28.080]  a half. The revolution. Isn't it wonderful? Doubling and tripling fuel prices, collapsing
[25:28.080 --> 25:34.240]  borders, massive crime, illness, poison shots, incredible levels of death. That is their
[25:34.240 --> 25:41.800]  new world order revolution against us. And if we recognize this revolution and say no
[25:41.800 --> 25:48.560]  to this revolution, it's over. And there is more in opposition. Texas announced regulations
[25:48.560 --> 25:54.560]  that BlackRock that funds and runs all this, that's the Rothschilds, are not allowed to
[25:54.560 --> 25:59.200]  do business or government contracts in Texas if they want to shut off the economy. We can
[25:59.200 --> 26:03.680]  strike back the same ways against them. It's happening all over the world. We have to strike
[26:03.680 --> 26:09.240]  back peacefully through the economy, culturally through our actions, spiritually through our
[26:09.240 --> 26:17.200]  prayer and God's direction. We can and we will beat their system because their system
[26:17.200 --> 26:24.920]  is a authoritarian, transhumanist, anti-host industrial system. Now, I'm going to spend
[26:24.920 --> 26:28.600]  a lot of time in the next longer segment going through all this and just what the current
[26:28.600 --> 26:32.000]  developments are and how to counter it. But I just want to remind listeners, I've written
[26:32.000 --> 26:37.840]  the new book. We have 500 books left of the books we ordered from Skyhorse. They're now
[26:37.840 --> 26:43.080]  shipping out. The Great Reset and the War for the Future. 500 books left. When those
[26:43.080 --> 26:47.880]  are gone, it will be a few weeks a month or so until we get more books in. And I can't
[26:47.880 --> 26:50.960]  do more signed books because I'm spending hours a day doing it. Those are starting to
[26:50.960 --> 26:55.040]  ship out. I want to thank you that we're part of the fundraiser and ordered the book. So
[26:55.040 --> 27:00.280]  if you want to get a signed book, we'll sell out today and it will be done. And then we'll
[27:00.280 --> 27:03.800]  just have the regular book soon. You'll be able to get the unsigned book at Amazon.com
[27:03.800 --> 27:08.000]  and everywhere else. It's been in the top 10 off and on for weeks. We want to push to
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.960]  number one. So if you want to do that, go to Amazon.com. But if you want to sign copy,
[27:11.960 --> 27:16.840]  go to www.FullWarStore.com. Remember, we're in a direct war with the New World Order.
[27:16.840 --> 27:22.400]  They don't have full power yet. And we are seen as the most dangerous vector of truth
[27:22.400 --> 27:28.960]  and human resistance. We are seen by the enemy as Satan. And that's a good thing because
[27:28.960 --> 27:33.400]  they hate our populist movement. They hate our focal point. They hate you being vindicated.
[27:33.400 --> 27:38.600]  They hate me being vindicated. They hate us coming together. So get ready and get prepared.
[27:38.600 --> 27:43.840]  And I told you two and a half years ago, get high-quality, storeable food because of inflation.
[27:43.840 --> 27:49.280]  You would save money into the future. It was the most important financial and physical
[27:49.280 --> 27:55.600]  security bet to make. You've seen food prices go up in the U.S. almost 50 percent around

[31:12.320 --> 31:16.240]  week. I don't remember sleeping but as far as the products go turbo force is my favorite

[31:37.400 --> 31:40.200]  I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone
[31:40.200 --> 31:43.560]  knock on my door and said Tate you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in
[31:43.560 --> 31:46.720]  every single way? There's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was

[33:21.800 --> 33:28.800]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones.
[33:28.800 --> 33:35.800]  All right. I want all our great listeners and viewers to understand something especially
[33:37.400 --> 33:43.720]  all the new people tuning in to find out what all the tumultuous hubbub and freaking out
[33:43.720 --> 33:49.480]  is about with this broadcast. I have been studying since I was a teenager global government
[33:49.480 --> 33:53.840]  the New World Order because I just kind of fell into it and found it extremely interesting
[33:53.840 --> 33:58.440]  how the world really works and we've got the enemy's number we know how to beat them and
[33:58.440 --> 34:02.280]  now those of us that have been opposing this including our supporters have been vindicated
[34:02.280 --> 34:07.520]  so the enemy is at a total rage because they've got a big plan for the world and the opposition
[34:07.520 --> 34:14.000]  is much more intense than they thought it would be.
[34:14.000 --> 34:20.500]  If you think doubling power prices and massive increasing food prices is bad and if you think
[34:20.500 --> 34:26.320]  the collapsing borders and skyrocketing crime is bad if you think the inflation is bad if
[34:26.320 --> 34:33.320]  you think the drag queen pedophile time is bad if you think any of that is bad you ain't
[34:35.520 --> 34:42.360]  seen nothing yet and we'll be covering that next hour just to note the crew. I notice
[34:42.360 --> 34:47.080]  I have a seven minute video about about drag queen pedophile time in Texas this new shocking
[34:47.080 --> 34:51.640]  compilation. There's a bunch of other videos though and I know it's not fit for even adult
[34:51.640 --> 34:57.160]  viewing naked people dancing around with children and all the rest of it but can you go through
[34:57.160 --> 35:04.160]  because I'm going to cover it next hour. I notice it wasn't on my list and get these
[35:04.160 --> 35:09.860]  videos that are around here these shorter videos and we've got them around the country
[35:09.860 --> 35:14.560]  true at Pride event in Charlottesville North Carolina a stripper pole where kids were able
[35:14.560 --> 35:21.560]  to try out a dancing pole while they sit in a lap of a gyrating man in a bikini. I mean
[35:30.240 --> 35:34.920]  what do you think is coming next it's all about them training you to accept whatever
[35:34.920 --> 35:41.920]  they want to do to you and to do to us so that's all coming up but this is a design collapse.
[35:45.400 --> 35:50.560]  This is happening this isn't going away and that's why the system is so freaked out we're
[35:50.560 --> 35:57.400]  still on air is because everybody from Tucker Carlson to Joe Rogan to Andrew Tate to you
[35:57.400 --> 36:03.040]  name it tunes into this show and they go research what I say and they go out and they find out
[36:03.040 --> 36:07.760]  it's true and they cover it and I'm not taking credit for it the enemy gives us the credit
[36:07.760 --> 36:11.720]  for that and those individuals I just talked about give us the credit for helping wake
[36:11.720 --> 36:18.720]  them up so they know as they said we're patient zero in the resistance to them they understand
[36:21.120 --> 36:26.600]  that this is the epicenter in the resistance to what they're doing so when you hear this
[36:26.600 --> 36:33.600]  information realize you're hearing as close as it gets to the pure bona fide pro human
[36:35.920 --> 36:40.920]  awakening and renaissance and that's what they can't stand and that's why they're so
[36:40.920 --> 36:45.320]  incredibly desperate to shut us down. Now I could talk all day about this but I want
[36:45.320 --> 36:50.120]  to play a clip from Steve Bannon first where he explains this collapse is almost irreversible
[36:50.120 --> 36:54.040]  or irreversible at this time and what that really means I'm going to lay it all out
[36:54.040 --> 36:58.440]  but here's Steve Bannon explaining. You know as the French poet told us the most important
[36:58.440 --> 37:02.240]  thing we need to do is to see what we see you've got to look reality in the face now
[37:02.240 --> 37:06.080]  and understand exactly what's going on in the world because there are decisions being
[37:06.080 --> 37:13.160]  made by people in power that are not just simply destructive they're so destructive
[37:13.160 --> 37:16.240]  they're not you're not going to be able to turn this around this is what I keep saying
[37:16.240 --> 37:21.400]  you saw Powell yesterday Powell's up there talking you know big talk we played from a
[37:21.400 --> 37:27.400]  year and a half ago Cortez and I in February 26 a year and a half to the day talking about
[37:27.400 --> 37:34.320]  what the problem was and a year ago yesterday at Jackson Hole at the same set of microphones
[37:34.320 --> 37:39.400]  that clown stood there and said no inflation is transitory and today it was you know fire
[37:39.400 --> 37:46.160]  and brimstone that he's got to choke it all down now and start invoking Paul Volcker's
[37:46.160 --> 37:52.320]  name and causing you know I caught the house of pain now it didn't have to be like this
[37:52.320 --> 37:57.680]  but it's going to get so much worse and here's why you have this fantasy and it's this mass
[37:57.680 --> 38:02.760]  psychosis you know by the Greta Thunbergs of the world and all the elites kowtow tour
[38:02.760 --> 38:06.840]  right they all got they all they all it's just like that it's just like the BLM in the Antifa

[38:40.920 --> 38:45.640]  be huge sacrifices because the air of abundance is over where is that 90 days ago he's on
[38:45.640 --> 38:51.120]  the campaign trail did something change in 90 days these decisions I want to bring in
[38:51.120 --> 38:54.360]  Dave Walsh I still got Eric Prince and Horwell and we get back to you guys in a second but

[38:59.600 --> 39:04.920]  versus mass but Tory fantasy okay and that's what they're going through right now I want
[39:04.920 --> 39:10.160]  to put this chart up from macron's France you want to see the end of civilization you
[39:10.160 --> 39:15.520]  want to see the collapse of civilization understand something when you talk about civilization
[39:15.520 --> 39:20.020]  air prince has told you hey you still got a minute it's called rare earths right you
[39:20.020 --> 39:23.720]  talk about your electronic vehicles all you guys sitting around a star box on your phones
[39:23.720 --> 39:30.040]  and your iPads and all that hey it comes out of the earth okay let me repeat that it comes
[39:30.040 --> 39:35.680]  out of the earth now we've given it all away so we don't control any of this and of course
[39:35.680 --> 39:40.200]  all the chips are made over in Silicon Valley West what just happens to be 90 miles off
[39:40.200 --> 39:46.160]  of the coast of our existential threat enemy right the Chinese Communist Party but on the
[39:46.160 --> 39:51.920]  energy part wind and solar are nice I believe in them I love them I don't like killing the
[39:51.920 --> 39:55.640]  birds as president Trump says but hey if you can do wind fine if you do solar fine but
[39:55.640 --> 40:02.680]  guess what it's right now a fantasy in a dream okay and they pass this bill and they talk
[40:02.680 --> 40:06.360]  all about this and this is all bailing out their buddies and private equity and venture
[40:06.360 --> 40:09.920]  capital they're underwater because these things are not commercial they're not close to being
[40:09.920 --> 40:15.040]  commercial not close to being commercial oh and by the way the guy at the head of this
[40:15.040 --> 40:20.000]  Elon Musk tweets out yes they hold you know and upon further review the climate change
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.240]  is not really the biggest primary face the biggest primary face is the population collapse
[40:25.240 --> 40:31.280]  in the north you know climate change is still important but the population collapse in the
[40:31.280 --> 40:36.200]  northern hemisphere let me repeat that from Elon Musk a guy I would think since he's the
[40:36.200 --> 40:42.040]  Thomas Edison of his age might know a thing or two about the math here I'm just saying
[40:42.040 --> 40:46.120]  I'm just throwing it out there put the chart up from France you want to know why macrones
[40:46.120 --> 40:51.560]  up there tell the people of France that the age of abundance is over and thank God they
[40:51.560 --> 40:55.680]  at least kept their nuclear power industry they put it into bankruptcy so the state can
[40:55.680 --> 41:01.480]  run it so it's going to be horribly inefficient but they had advanced nuclear program Germany
[41:01.480 --> 41:06.280]  shut it down put that chart up Dave Walsh come in here brother because now the financial
[41:06.280 --> 41:13.160]  times is quoting here's the headline from the FT people are going to die and you have
[41:13.160 --> 41:17.200]  a mother of a four year old said I make a decision every day of paying my bill or feeding
[41:17.200 --> 41:25.360]  my kid okay you have 20 Bloomberg report you have 20 million households in the United States
[41:25.360 --> 41:29.280]  of America let me repeat that I think there's only 100 million households in the country
[41:29.280 --> 41:35.440]  20 million households that would be let me do some math here oh 20% of our population
[41:35.440 --> 41:42.840]  households in the country are so far behind on their power bill that Bloomberg who's also
[41:42.840 --> 41:51.640]  not a hair on fire war room type says it's a tsunami of shutoffs this is what your leaders
[41:51.640 --> 41:57.440]  have done Biden and Markelle and the guys the World Economic Forum and these fantasy

[42:11.720 --> 42:16.800]  Party at the ramparts on this thing we the first actually did the Trump thing was to
[42:16.800 --> 42:21.040]  get out of the Paris Accord that was another dangerous fantasy you're underwriting the

[48:58.560 --> 49:05.440]  intervention in power markets is all hell breaks loose which they themselves triggered

[50:04.240 --> 50:08.760]  to call cows to meet climate targets because they're saying cow farts are poisonous which
[50:08.760 --> 50:14.120]  they aren't i go back to some of the ancient beautiful paintings found for more than 20,000
[50:14.120 --> 50:22.240]  years ago and 17,000 plus years ago in the cave complex in southwestern france is famous
[50:22.240 --> 50:27.760]  for its paleolithic cave paintings they contain 900 of the most perfect surviving examples
[50:27.760 --> 50:33.640]  of upper paleolithic art are estimated to be over 17 to 30,000 years old depending on
[50:33.640 --> 50:39.200]  which group of caves and what did they worship the cow because it had so much meat was so
[50:39.200 --> 50:43.240]  good for you to eat and that's what they're trying to target is what's been making humans
[50:43.240 --> 50:50.760]  successful for so long and there's riots and all sorts of destabilization happening all
[50:50.760 --> 51:00.280]  over the world this is economic warfare this is siege against the people of the planet
[51:00.280 --> 51:07.760]  and so many people think you can just halfway oppose all of this and it'll go away no as
[51:07.760 --> 51:16.800]  Steve Bannon said earlier where is congress where are the republicans even speaking out
[51:16.800 --> 51:22.600]  against the energy cut offs and shutdowns in the u.s. they're just going along with it
[51:22.600 --> 51:28.800]  they're not even making it campaign issues that's extremely dangerous and then you got
[51:28.800 --> 51:36.760]  the drudge report dot com you've got this headline trump in an orange jumpsuit trump
[51:36.760 --> 51:47.840]  indictment watch riots if prosecuted fbi the dawn calls for uprising but but trump didn't
[51:47.840 --> 51:55.440]  call for an uprising here's the yahoo news article that they're quoting he he he sent
[51:55.440 --> 51:59.000]  a message to the attorney general and said you're really raising the temperature how
[51:59.000 --> 52:06.960]  can I help to lower it I've seen enough of Donald Trump he'll be indicted by a federal
[52:06.960 --> 52:12.000]  grand jury says Brad Moss you heard me right I believe Trump will actually be indicted for
[52:12.000 --> 52:17.520]  criminal offense even with all its redactions the probable cause haven't even published
[52:17.520 --> 52:25.680]  today by the magistrate judge in Florida makes this clear in three essential points one trump
[52:25.680 --> 52:31.280]  was unauthorized possession of national defense of the nation namely property mark classified
[52:31.280 --> 52:37.560]  documents though he declassified it number two he was put on notice by the u.s. government
[52:37.560 --> 52:49.240]  he was not permitted to retain those but obama kept 30 million of them and it goes on from
[52:49.240 --> 52:59.880]  there the fbi finally executed a search warrant earlier this month now where is it in here
[52:59.880 --> 53:06.680]  that trumps calling for an uprising he's not but that's the headline the dawn calls for
[53:06.680 --> 53:21.360]  an uprising and what did Biden say last week he thinks it's imminent
[53:21.360 --> 53:26.840]  that Trump supporters are going to be violent translates we've got provocateurs we've got
[53:26.840 --> 53:34.860]  our own operatives we've got major false flags ready that's what you do when you're a deep
[53:34.860 --> 53:40.360]  state that doesn't want to lose control of a country you've stolen elections to stay
[53:40.360 --> 53:47.640]  in control of and that's the reality I want to give the number out I don't want to take
[53:47.640 --> 53:53.680]  your calls specifically on inflation and the collapse the economy and how do we mobilize
[53:53.680 --> 53:58.200]  to stop this when it's so obvious when they admit it's their plan to bring us to our knees
[53:58.200 --> 54:04.320]  and what do you think should be done if they indict Trump well certainly nothing violent
[54:04.320 --> 54:09.520]  that's what they're telegraphing they want it's what they're pre-programming Trump shouldn't
[54:09.520 --> 54:14.000]  have been raided from did nothing wrong I'm a critic of Trump on the poison vaccines but
[54:14.000 --> 54:19.920]  he still is a popular leader who had the election stolen from him and we should support him
[54:19.920 --> 54:23.480]  but to further demonize Trump when and if they indict him which I think they will indict
[54:23.480 --> 54:30.440]  him they're going to stage provocative events to further demonize Trump and populists in
[54:30.440 --> 54:37.120]  America period tying us to Trump and tying us to the violence that's why they need to
[54:37.120 --> 54:43.200]  get us off air ahead of this that's why they're so desperate to do it so the Democrats have
[54:43.200 --> 54:49.120]  filed in federal court to seize control of info wars last Friday claiming we're a criminal
[54:49.120 --> 54:56.800]  organization and all these lies with no evidence and no real facts because they've been given
[54:56.800 --> 55:03.720]  the orders by their higher ups to get us off air because they need us off air when they
[55:03.720 --> 55:07.520]  stage the attacks when the globalist stage the attacks when the deep state stage the
[55:07.520 --> 55:14.480]  attacks just say we're behind it that's how specific that's how direct and that's how
[55:14.480 --> 55:19.920]  real this is but thank God the public of America and all over the world understands the new
[55:19.920 --> 55:25.280]  world order understands the great reset understands their programs and are not buying it they're
[55:25.280 --> 55:32.800]  not going along with it we're gonna open the phones up now on the great reset and how to
[55:32.800 --> 55:37.400]  stop it your view on how bad the inflation and food prices energy prices are gonna go
[55:37.400 --> 55:42.240]  that's the big rail and the other big rail is the Trump indictment and the globalist
[55:42.240 --> 55:45.320]  pre-programming there's gonna be all this violence what's your take on that how do we
[55:45.320 --> 55:51.000]  counter that and what curveballs do you think they have hack attacks energy takedowns they've
[55:51.000 --> 55:56.760]  been pre-programming that artificial power outages that's what's on the table in my view
[55:56.760 --> 56:02.200]  what else you think they'll pull toll free number to join us 877-789-2539 we're taking
[56:02.200 --> 56:11.760]  first time callers again 877-789-2539-877-789 Alex and your calls are coming up separately
[56:11.760 --> 56:15.720]  we got a good chance to back on this down together but we got to stay on air we need

[1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:13.720]  after receiving the shot and for those who survived the deadly shot and are able to reproduce
[1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:21.640]  their offspring's DNA is now forever mutated there is now irrefutable proof that the mRNA
[1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:27.560]  vaccines are a deadly toxin aside from the relentless debilitating spike protein that's
[1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:33.520]  keeping everyone who has been jabbed sick the vaccines contain metals metals that have
[1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:39.800]  been observed to self assemble side of the body and most disturbingly metals that assemble
[1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:46.520]  in somebody study show that these metals are found in the blood of 94% of those who have
[1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:54.320]  received a covid vaccine and these mysterious conglomerates of metal make their final appearance
[1:00:54.320 --> 1:01:00.720]  in the dead all over the world coroners are now finding that the arteries of the vaccinated
[1:01:00.720 --> 1:01:07.800]  have been clogged with mysterious growths nonorganic masses made up of conductive metals
[1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:15.000]  such as aluminum sodium and tin this is what's most likely causing all the organ failure
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:21.280]  and heart attacks heart attacks in our children two days ago I I flew out my first ten year
[1:01:21.280 --> 1:01:25.360]  old with a heart attack and I had to fight the doctor in the ER because he's like ten
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:30.200]  year olds don't have heart attacks and I argued back and forth for 30 minutes to force his
[1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:37.320]  hand to get an EKG to find out that he was had almost a complete STEMI which is ST elevated
[1:01:37.320 --> 1:01:42.840]  myocardial infarction for which you could see it lit up on the 12 lead EKG and he's like
[1:01:42.840 --> 1:01:46.720]  well that's not possible and I'm like well he was just vaccinated yesterday it is very
[1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:52.120]  much possible at any given time people are getting a hold of me and the nurse advocates
[1:01:52.120 --> 1:01:57.800]  of American frontline nurses to help advocate because as you've seen there is a victim shaming
[1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:03.560]  that it does oh it's anxiety oh it's this but in actuality if they put down that it
[1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:09.200]  was a vaccine injury the physician the corporation the hospital the clinic they actually won't
[1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:14.760]  get reimbursed so it gets labeled as anxiety according to the whistleblowers the doctors
[1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:20.360]  are lying about the vaccine deaths to make a few thousand bucks is that why Trump has
[1:02:20.360 --> 1:02:26.640]  been pushing the deadly shots killing our own children for a measly million dollars
[1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:32.080]  now that the truth about the deadly COVID vaccines is finally starting to break free
[1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:37.880]  the mainstream media is shifting their narrative and blaming it all on President Trump and
[1:02:37.880 --> 1:02:43.960]  they've already laid the groundwork back in 2016 when the herd was told to believe that
[1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:50.160]  Trump is literally Hitler we should look at Adolf Hitler in 1929 he was a kind of a funny
[1:02:50.160 --> 1:02:55.200]  kind of character that said the things that people were thinking where Donald Trump takes
[1:02:55.200 --> 1:03:00.480]  it I have absolutely no idea but Donald Trump is a dangerous man with the things that he
[1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:06.840]  has been saying you might argue that Trump is innocent but he doesn't he brags of all
[1:03:06.840 --> 1:03:13.280]  the lives he has saved and the herd will believe what they are told to believe it shows you
[1:03:13.280 --> 1:03:19.760]  how un-painful that vaccine shot is so everybody go get your shot it works incredibly well
[1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:25.920]  95% maybe even more than that it works incredibly well it's a great vaccine it's a safe vaccine
[1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:30.880]  and it's something that works I recommend you take it but I also believe in your freedoms
[1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:36.360]  a hundred percent when you have the vaccine people that do and it's a very small number
[1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:40.880]  relatively but people that do get it get better much quicker and it's a very important thing
[1:03:40.880 --> 1:03:45.480]  to know they don't get nearly as thick and they get it but they get better Lindsey Graham's
[1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:49.760]  an example he said if I didn't have this vaccine I would have died and you know what I believe
[1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:54.680]  totally in your freedoms I do breathe you got to do what you have to do but I recommend
[1:03:54.680 --> 1:04:00.560]  take the vaccines I did it it's good take the vaccines but you got now that's okay that's
[1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:07.000]  alright you got your freedoms but I happen to take the vaccine the vaccines do work
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:13.600]  and they are effective I am I think I saved many I don't think I know I saved millions
[1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:18.040]  and millions of lives throughout the world we could have had another Spanish flu we could
[1:04:18.040 --> 1:04:23.320]  have had you know in 1917 close to a hundred million people died they say but it was really
[1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:28.840]  bad and now other countries are using our vaccines and you know tremendous they're
[1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:33.440]  tremendously successful you're playing right into their hands when you sort of like oh
[1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:38.160]  the vaccine if you don't want to take it you shouldn't be forced to take it no mandates
[1:04:38.160 --> 1:04:44.520]  but take credit because we saved tens of millions of lives take credit don't let them take that
[1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:53.280]  away from you okay so the president made do you agree with that both the president and
[1:04:53.280 --> 1:05:01.280]  I are Vax and did you get the booster yes I got it too everybody knows that high quality

[1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:28.720]  is saying okay the vaccine doesn't work it's all trumps fault so they're the ones that
[1:06:28.720 --> 1:06:33.760]  try to make it mandatory and they're still trying to make it mandatory if you're like
[1:06:33.760 --> 1:06:39.120]  jokovich to come play tennis here they're the bad guys compared to what trump did getting
[1:06:39.120 --> 1:06:44.240]  manipulated to this but he won't admit he's wrong because he made himself the father of
[1:06:44.240 --> 1:06:49.160]  this poison i want to go to your phone calls we've loaded the phone lines up i want to
[1:06:49.160 --> 1:06:53.760]  talk about the great reshet the global collapse we talked about last hour that even steve man
[1:06:53.760 --> 1:06:57.760]  is saying is it reversible that micron says it's irreversible but they're the ones that
[1:06:57.760 --> 1:07:01.920]  implemented it the people that control micron i want to talk about how they're saying they're
[1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:06.240]  going to arrest trump all over the news and that republicans are engaged in a violent
[1:07:06.240 --> 1:07:11.200]  uprising and that trumps calling for an uprising but you read the articles trump hasn't called
[1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:15.520]  for an uprising clearly they're planning false flags ahead of the election what's your take
[1:07:15.520 --> 1:07:20.640]  on that or do you disagree with me or agree or what would you like to add we're talking

[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:05.600]  uk government confirms nine in every ten
[1:08:06.240 --> 1:08:15.360]  covid deaths over the last year have been among the fully triple vaxed
[1:08:15.360 --> 1:08:22.320]  same numbers here in the u.s. same numbers in europe same numbers in australia same numbers
[1:08:22.320 --> 1:08:29.120]  in canada same numbers in new zealand same numbers in israel same numbers in every other place like
[1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:37.600]  costa rica and the rest of it that have taken the madonna and fizer shots
[1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:48.320]  you get the same effect unbelievable and that's published again in the landsuit
[1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:54.880]  and many other prestigious publications 94 percent not just nine out of ten
[1:08:56.720 --> 1:09:01.680]  nine point four percent 94 percent baby
[1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:07.120]  and i mean i think about this morning noon and night i think about this i woke up at
[1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:12.640]  like three a.m. this morning and i got up went to the bathroom got a glass of water
[1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:18.960]  i'm sitting there on the side of the bed in the dark and i'm just i'm thinking like
[1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:23.280]  how am i supposed to respond to this just come on air and report i don't like it's no big deal
[1:09:24.400 --> 1:09:28.720]  oh you're paying nine times their energy bills in germany oh we're set to pay double here we're
[1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:38.000]  already paying for 49 percent more oh i mean we're being totally and completely screwed and they're
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:44.720]  like yeah you're way more likely to die we take a shot and then just this weekend i went to several
[1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:55.360]  corporate meetings then i went to several parties and then i talked today to an employee i won't say
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:10:03.040]  their name but the second of just about three weeks who had a young family member and by young one
[1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:10.160]  was 35 one was 51 that's young no pre-existing health problems that's just here at the office
[1:10:12.640 --> 1:10:16.800]  in every case they took the modernist shot which is the equivalent of four
[1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:24.800]  fizer shots the exact same mRNA same formula modernist suing fizer for ripping off their formula
[1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:28.240]  that happened last week another should have dropped
[1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:37.520]  but it's moderna is the killer baby i mean it's like getting shot with a 50 caliber versus a 22
[1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:48.080]  or maybe a 50 caliber versus a nine millimeter 22 is so much smaller than 50 cal bmg it's about a
[1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:53.680]  nine millimeter versus a 50 cal would you rather get shot with a 50 caliber barrett rifle or would
[1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:57.360]  you rather get shot with a 22 i don't want to get shot with either one but i'll take the you
[1:10:57.360 --> 1:11:03.840]  know the the nine mil and in every case let me tell you what the employee told me and i'm not
[1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:09.360]  going to say their name they made me promise i would even say what departments are in but their
[1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:17.360]  stepmother who they like who they've known for 20 years their dad remarried but she's closer
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:18.720]  was closer to stepmother
[1:11:21.200 --> 1:11:26.240]  i'm already going well there's a lot of women work here so it's okay but the point is a woman
[1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:34.800]  stepmother took the second moderna shot in late spring took the first one in early spring
[1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:41.040]  had great health jogged lifted weights was an overweight 51 years old
[1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:52.800]  she got really sick and felt terrible after the first shot because they were just at the funeral
[1:11:52.800 --> 1:12:02.160]  last week by the way this this person died in austin but is being buried
[1:12:03.840 --> 1:12:10.000]  in another state so the person has to take off this week to go for the burial that's what they're
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:17.920]  telling me about now this is just one story okay i got a bunch of these at meetings this
[1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:23.920]  weekend with people who don't who by the way don't even listen to me or believe what i'm talking about
[1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:29.680]  but but i'll get to that a minute ago to your cost but this is it's these anecdotal stories
[1:12:29.680 --> 1:12:33.600]  that really people understand and really you know it comes home it's like Stalin said one man dies
[1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:39.440]  it's a tragedy 10 000 dies is a statistic so she takes the shot the first one he gets really sick
[1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:45.680]  and has covered like symptoms for a few weeks but so waits an extra month so two months later
[1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:57.600]  gets the second shot within a week her kidneys failed she goes on dialysis then she has a stroke
[1:12:57.600 --> 1:13:08.320]  a month later then has mycocardias is in the hospital for a month gets out and goes to rehab
[1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:12.880]  trying to learn how to walk again because they've gotten neurological stuff
[1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:19.120]  from the stroke and then died last week in her sleep
[1:13:23.520 --> 1:13:31.120]  the other crew members dad died three weeks ago he was 60 something years old in good health
[1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:38.720]  and guess what he died of mycocardias and you're like well those are older people
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:43.040]  no ladies and gentlemen i was in meetings this weekend and i'll just leave it at that
[1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:48.800]  with corporate people that don't listen to the show they're like you know i think you're right
[1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:53.120]  everybody i know is dying from these shots or having heart attacks or this or that i mean it's
[1:13:53.120 --> 1:13:57.200]  you don't need me to tell you this you already see it you already hear it we have the damn numbers
[1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:06.320]  they have a record 40 plus percent increase in death 18 to 63 working age in australia in
[1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:14.560]  new zealand in the uk in europe in the us in canada in all these other places where they took the
[1:14:14.560 --> 1:14:24.800]  shots they admit it and i was talking to this crew member i said what did the family say
[1:14:28.560 --> 1:14:30.800]  they said they're pissed they said
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:40.000]  because you know they had like a family wake couple days after she died they all got together
[1:14:41.680 --> 1:14:45.360]  and everybody was talking why didn't people tell us and everybody was telling stories about
[1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:48.480]  how this person got sick or that died and they're all at this family
[1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:56.880]  post you know death pre wake thing and they're all saying why didn't we get told this why why
[1:14:56.880 --> 1:15:05.040]  why why weren't why didn't we know her job told her she needed the shot she's dead now
[1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:14.160]  and what's the takeaway of this they're just normalizing this where there's this background
[1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:18.560]  this ambient background of mass death and they're telling us they're depopulating us and they think
[1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:24.400]  it's funny and now they want us to be able to take these shots to have a job in the future
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:31.280]  they're literally murdering us and they think it's funny and so people ask me you know how do you
[1:15:31.280 --> 1:15:35.600]  take all the attacks how do you i mean none of my family took this stuff none of them are dying

[1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:16.080]  with an experimental shot that's the left oh they love black people so much at the US open
[1:22:17.120 --> 1:22:24.640]  where jokovic's band where he's not allowed to play because he had taken the poisoned shot
[1:22:24.640 --> 1:22:28.160]  notice who the main sponsor is madarna
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:37.920]  meanwhile the rats are leaving the sinking ship we have the puppet governor
[1:22:39.200 --> 1:22:47.680]  of new york the appointed governor york governor kathy hoshell when the decisions were made to
[1:22:47.680 --> 1:22:52.800]  have all the kids go home and learn remotely wow wow what a mistake that was even though she
[1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:58.880]  supported keeping it going indefinitely she also backed off on school closures quote what
[1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:05.920]  mistake that was women couldn't go to their jobs they lost their jobs or they'd be back at their
[1:23:05.920 --> 1:23:11.040]  jobs then one child is a class test positive the whole class goes home for a week and a half it was
[1:23:11.040 --> 1:23:18.400]  chaos seemed to have not ended so now the very people that engineered all this are saying they're
[1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:23.520]  against it i want to go to your phone calls and i will go to your phone calls but i'm gonna play a
[1:23:23.520 --> 1:23:29.920]  few joe rogan clips here he had erin rogers the champion quarterback on he talked about how they
[1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:34.560]  sent stuges in with slideshows to try to make them take the poison shots were nine out of ten
[1:23:34.560 --> 1:23:40.880]  that take it are the ones that are dying now and then he talks about joe talks about voting republican
[1:23:40.880 --> 1:23:45.680]  because the democrats handled the whole coba thing so badly absolutely they're the ones that
[1:23:45.680 --> 1:23:49.680]  were the authoritarians they're the ones that try to make it mandatory but trump won't decouple
[1:23:49.680 --> 1:23:54.960]  instead he's destroying himself here are the clips back to back they didn't give a you want to play
[1:23:54.960 --> 1:24:00.720]  football take this thing and i want you to do it publicly so that i can get more money out of those
[1:24:00.720 --> 1:24:04.800]  other people that are thinking about it and they're on the fence yeah and then we're going to virtue
[1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:11.760]  signal to say look how right is our league is we have 95 compliance yes with the vaccine compliance
[1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:19.360]  and if you don't we're going to send a stooge to your team to show you graphs of your vaccination
[1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:23.760]  percentage of your team compared to the rest of the league which actually happened really yeah
[1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:29.360]  what was the stooge like oh i mopped the floor with him did you yeah see again that's why people
[1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:34.240]  like no one knew your vaccination status you lied to your teammates no no no day three of training
[1:24:34.240 --> 1:24:40.640]  camp they sent this stooge in and and he showed these slides about what your vaccination percentage
[1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:45.760]  was in your team where you compare the rest of the league and i started asking them questions about
[1:24:45.760 --> 1:24:53.200]  liability oh i'm not a lawyer okay cool but you're in here talking about all these different things
[1:24:54.560 --> 1:24:59.920]  and you don't talk about anybody's personal health issues there's zero exemptions you took out
[1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:06.960]  religious exemptions you took it you took out a peg exemptions you took out anybody's ability to
[1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:12.160]  to have an opinion no i don't want to do this yeah well it's not only going to affect
[1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:17.040]  your uh day-to-day status on the team but your ability to get a job your ability to keep a job
[1:25:17.040 --> 1:25:23.040]  your ability to get a try out if you get cut from this team because you want to put a percentage
[1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:27.280]  above 90 percent of your team where you guys can have some sort of like special virtue like look
[1:25:27.280 --> 1:25:32.080]  how amazing we are we're above the 90 threshold here and then and then they they scared teams
[1:25:32.080 --> 1:25:39.760]  said if you had an outbreak caused by a non-vaccinated player you not only forfeit that game if you had
[1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:46.640]  enough players out but you wouldn't get paid for that week and here i am showing up to training
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:53.760]  camp the first day and we got five people who work for the organization out with covid all fully
[1:25:53.760 --> 1:26:03.600]  waxed and i got covid from a fully waxed individual who only got waxed to keep his potential of being
[1:26:03.600 --> 1:26:09.360]  a part of the NFL no one who is alive today had ever experienced a true pandemic and i'm hoping
[1:26:09.360 --> 1:26:15.280]  that now that this is over people are going to you know recognize that some serious errors were
[1:26:15.280 --> 1:26:19.520]  made and not repeat those that's the best you can get out of it so what do you tell those people vote
[1:26:19.520 --> 1:26:28.320]  republican that's what a lot of them are going to do anyway yeah yeah oh yeah i mean more than a
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:35.440]  million people transferred over to the republican party uh i think in 2021 alone find out what that
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:40.480]  number is but you know you look at guys like ronda santis who kept florida open and and had
[1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:45.840]  some pretty reasonable policies in terms of like what what to do about covid and you know he mapped
[1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:51.440]  it out on television he was you know widely criticized for this where he was saying like we
[1:26:51.440 --> 1:26:55.680]  need to protect our elders we need to you know make sure that medical care is available for
[1:26:55.680 --> 1:27:00.080]  those people and everyone else you should be able to do whatever you want to do and protect your freedom
[1:27:02.080 --> 1:27:07.040]  joe did a good job exposing the fact that the batch doesn't work but you know he's wrong there
[1:27:07.600 --> 1:27:11.040]  saying the best we can hope for is just not let them do it again they're planning to do it again
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:17.360]  we need to bring fauci and dazzic and bill gates and big pharma like fiser and maderna to justice
[1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:23.840]  they need to go to prison they did it premeditatedly they cooked up the virus they released it they gave
[1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:28.560]  us a deadly shot that the cdc knew in october 2020 would erase your immune system and give you
[1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:34.560]  heart swelling and heart attacks and attack of fertility it was a premeditated plan it wasn't
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:41.920]  an accident it was run worldwide coordinated with big tech and governments censoring anybody
[1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:48.240]  medical experts you name it that tried to expose what was happening it was an organized biological
[1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:54.240]  chemical attack and just two years into it the death tolls off the charts and it's only gonna get
[1:27:54.240 --> 1:28:01.760]  worse that's the reality but at least joe has come out against it in the last couple years
[1:28:01.760 --> 1:28:09.360]  but we need to go further and we need to bring the criminals that did this to justice we're coming

[1:33:46.240 --> 1:33:51.200]  using me as the straw man a demonized version of alex jones to do that this is happening this is
[1:33:51.200 --> 1:33:56.080]  not like the other probes before that we're meant to get you used to probes and censorship thinking
[1:33:56.080 --> 1:34:01.520]  you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it now this attack is thousands and thousands
[1:34:01.520 --> 1:34:07.040]  and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks this is a tight traded dose

[1:34:14.160 --> 1:34:18.640]  in layman's terms they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed we adapt to
[1:34:18.640 --> 1:34:24.960]  being pressed with the low dosages of oppression now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover
[1:34:24.960 --> 1:34:31.120]  we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the

[1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:08.160]  complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us so
[1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:13.440]  they take what i've said being sincere build me into an insincere person in the straw man i'm
[1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:17.680]  a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars and so they make me a murder
[1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:22.720]  of children and then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually
[1:35:22.720 --> 1:35:28.720]  censoring all of you to make a debate about alex joe so even if i didn't sell out to them they

[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:04.240]  anticipate they're gonna bring down to whatever they're gonna bring it down to and i i bought

[1:37:26.640 --> 1:37:33.280]  i was told by a employee employer at one time when the rest of the world has pneumonia a miracle
[1:37:33.280 --> 1:37:39.120]  will never have more than a cough in the respect that that was during reagan's years like because
[1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:44.560]  it was really concerning to me that's right our infrastructure is so huge there's there that that
[1:37:44.560 --> 1:37:49.440]  they're trying to collapse us first but it's still very serious but i agree you shouldn't be afraid
[1:37:49.440 --> 1:37:55.040]  you should take action be as successful as you can and then help others yes exactly that's what

[1:37:59.280 --> 1:38:04.960]  quick let's go ahead and talk to kyle in new jersey kyle you're on the air hey alex a pleasure to
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:11.600]  be on with you thank you um i just want to preface by saying uh i actually am an ex-visor employee um
[1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:17.600]  i just recently quit in april due to discrimination uh and i'm pursuing better things in my life but
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:24.160]  i want to go back to this far as uh 2025 2028 document which was done by bill gates of course
[1:38:24.160 --> 1:38:31.200]  in 2017 and in that document of course they bring this president archer who is probably
[1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:35.840]  synonymous for president trump and it says president archers detractors and the republican party
[1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:41.520]  sees the opportunity to publicly disparage the president and his administration's response
[1:38:41.520 --> 1:38:47.120]  to the pandemic i.e trump's and they urge voters to elect a stronger leader with better interest
[1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:52.720]  for the american people and then a little further down it says and as investigations grew in intensity
[1:38:52.720 --> 1:38:57.760]  several high ranking officials at the cdc and fda were forced to step down or withdrew from
[1:38:57.760 --> 1:39:01.440]  government the government in order to spend more time with their families while we see
[1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:06.640]  fallacy leaving bill gates left the thinking ship a long time ago the fda fda has been pretty
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:10.880]  pretty well gutted and this whole thing with president trump i'll just give it to you short
[1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:17.600]  i think which he's bad baggage i mean president trump's ego is never going to change he wants
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:24.320]  to appease everybody he's not the same guy we voted for and i think us being such a strong leader
[1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:30.720]  for the populist movement has to get behind somebody else i think we'll see how it goes and
[1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:34.720]  this is the midterms but we got to get behind somebody and personally no i agree and we've
[1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:40.560]  got to give trump a chance but but that chance is rapidly going away and i did get an answer from
[1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:46.240]  trump on friday and i taped del big tree show saturday this can air later this week and i broke
[1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:52.960]  the news there it's pretty big news and i'm i'm not really ready to break it at this point
[1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:57.600]  because i need to actually shoot a special report on it so it's millions of views and actually
[1:39:57.600 --> 1:40:02.240]  has an effect there's millions tuning in now but if i just pepper it into the regular show no one
[1:40:02.240 --> 1:40:08.080]  seems to care even though i lay such a huge bomb on us but i talked to multiple people and i got a
[1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:16.320]  response back from trump and uh on the ultimatum and so we we we got a response back and can you
[1:40:16.320 --> 1:40:21.600]  imagine what the response was you think he's going to come out against these things publicly and
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:34.320]  begin to fight like you are are you hopeful of that let me do this at the end of the third hour and
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:40.480]  guys mark it in there because you know i get distracted i've even forgotten about this and
[1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:44.000]  i was meaning to talk about it the start of the show and i shouldn't do it and i need to i need
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:47.600]  to i mean it's a big deal and i need to really think about what i'm gonna say here because i want
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:54.880]  to be as accurate as possible uh but uh trump responded and i'll leave it at that and i'll uh
[1:40:54.880 --> 1:41:00.080]  last segment of the third hour when dr merits on with us i will uh tell you what trump had to say
[1:41:00.080 --> 1:41:06.320]  okay all right god bless you appreciate your call carlos in houston texas you're on here

[1:47:15.360 --> 1:47:25.920]  and now the end is near and so i face the final cousin
[1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:38.400]  my friend i'll say it clear i'll state my case of which i'm certain
[1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:53.680]  i've lived a life that's full i traveled each and every highway and more
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:48:12.320]  much more than this i did it my way regrets i've had a few but then again
[1:48:12.320 --> 1:48:28.720]  too few to mention i did what i had to do saw it through without exemption
[1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:41.280]  and i planned each chartered course each capital step along the highway
[1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:52.800]  and more much more than this i did it my way i did it my old blue eyes
[1:48:52.800 --> 1:48:58.960]  all right i'm gonna go back to your calls and we have some huge breaking news that's so big
[1:49:00.880 --> 1:49:05.760]  i mean the ramifications this is so giant most talk show hosts who understood the ramifications
[1:49:05.760 --> 1:49:10.240]  most don't would actually just stop the show right here and cancel taking calls or guests
[1:49:10.240 --> 1:49:18.800]  and cover this uh but who's doing the fourth hour jeryl salente jeryl's great i'm gonna take
[1:49:18.800 --> 1:49:27.120]  15 minutes of jeryl's time to cover this right here and this ties into what trump relayed to me on
[1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:36.480]  friday i have mixed feelings about being upset with trump because he the enemy hates him he did so
[1:49:36.480 --> 1:49:44.640]  much good he's a lot of good people elected he's a good person i know he is intellectually and
[1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:51.440]  spiritually gut level i i know but he's pigheaded and he's going along with this poison shot as
[1:49:51.440 --> 1:49:57.360]  it derails and comes out which is in the spars 2025 2028 document that a caller earlier mentioned
[1:49:58.080 --> 1:50:04.160]  he's been set up but then he does something like this and it makes me love him more
[1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:12.000]  trumps come out and called for a new election with the fbi admitting that zuckerberg told the
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:20.080]  truth on joe rogan last week right down the street from our offices that they went and
[1:50:20.080 --> 1:50:25.600]  ordered them to cover that up for the election the fbi responded today and said yeah we did
[1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:32.000]  that's no big deal we do that all the time so they election meddled with joe biden being a
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:37.360]  chinese agent and pedophilia and crack pipes and all the rest of the the money payments from ukraine
[1:50:37.360 --> 1:50:42.640]  and the rest of it and zuckerberg covers his ass because he knows it's coming out and says
[1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:49.040]  the fbi told him not to allow it on facebook and then they run headlines everywhere that trumps
[1:50:49.040 --> 1:50:54.240]  calling for insurrection and violence when he's not you can see what they're getting ready to do
[1:50:54.240 --> 1:51:03.520]  false flags so it's fashionable to bash trump and i'm pissed at him but at the end of the day look
[1:51:03.520 --> 1:51:11.680]  at this so now it comes out this is trump today on truth social so now it comes out conclusively
[1:51:12.240 --> 1:51:18.960]  but the fbi buried the hunter biden laptop story before the election knowing that if they didn't
[1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:23.440]  trump would have easily won the 2020 presidential election this is massive fraud and election
[1:51:23.440 --> 1:51:29.920]  interference at a level never seen before in our country remedy declare the rightful winner or
[1:51:29.920 --> 1:51:36.400]  or and this would be the minimal solution to clear the 2020 election irrevocably compromise and
[1:51:36.400 --> 1:51:40.800]  have a new election immediately yeah the answer is a new election and i agree with trump
[1:51:42.880 --> 1:51:48.080]  and and if they rehold it i'll vote for him because he's light years better it's not a
[1:51:48.880 --> 1:51:54.720]  lesser of two evils it's that they stole it from him and we need to rehab the election
[1:51:54.720 --> 1:52:00.880]  and they're trying to say it's terrorist to call for a new election so this is just bombshell
[1:52:01.920 --> 1:52:09.280]  i mean trumps got wavos the size of bowling balls and that's why i'm so pissed at him that he won't
[1:52:09.280 --> 1:52:13.520]  attack the people that sent him and set us up and they're bragging how they did it and how they
[1:52:13.520 --> 1:52:18.160]  lied to him and told him it would work and it didn't and they told him rendezavir would work
[1:52:18.160 --> 1:52:24.800]  not his advisors outside groups he was actually the bad guy told him take rendezavir he came out
[1:52:24.800 --> 1:52:33.040]  and said rendezavir was bad he promoted the monoclonials that worked and the other treatments
[1:52:33.040 --> 1:52:37.920]  and and and the ivermectin and got demonized for it it's just insane it makes my head spin
[1:52:38.480 --> 1:52:41.760]  i mean we are in the thick of the battle now ladies and gentlemen
[1:52:41.760 --> 1:52:46.960]  whoo carlos
[1:52:49.840 --> 1:52:53.200]  in houston you were finishing your point about a sci-fi show go ahead
[1:52:55.360 --> 1:53:02.720]  hello alex you there yes sir go ahead so so so the show has had everything or had everything
[1:53:02.720 --> 1:53:09.280]  it was it was made by francis fork coppola who was one of the main ones that that that was front
[1:53:09.280 --> 1:53:14.480]  running the show now this is back in 95 this is when you had started talking about all this alex
[1:53:14.480 --> 1:53:19.600]  and that's what turned me on i love you alex i love everything i i work in the oil and gas
[1:53:19.600 --> 1:53:26.000]  industry as well alex they've canceled millions upon millions of dollars worth of future projects
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:32.640]  that they already had scheduled tank farms pipelines all across the country that they're
[1:53:32.640 --> 1:53:37.520]  they're not struggling with permits they have a lot of stuff but they there's not going to be
[1:53:37.520 --> 1:53:43.920]  a future for oil and gas per what the world economic forum is planning a lot of these gas
[1:53:43.920 --> 1:53:48.320]  companies have canceled a lot of this work there's going to be a lot of us in the oil and gas
[1:53:48.320 --> 1:53:53.600]  industry they're going to be out of work or just be doing small rehab jobs where we're fixing the
[1:53:53.600 --> 1:54:00.400]  current infrastructure but not replacing it with new infrastructure that we should be putting in
[1:54:01.120 --> 1:54:04.880]  now a lot of the stuff that we're putting in or that we have been putting in over the past
[1:54:04.880 --> 1:54:12.320]  couple years can run in reverse so you can run to the dock and then you can run back and reverse
[1:54:12.320 --> 1:54:18.320]  and unload ships that are that are that are porting at any one of our port to a natural gas
[1:54:18.320 --> 1:54:24.400]  pipeline to get that gas in the state which means they've been doing this for about the
[1:54:24.400 --> 1:54:29.360]  past two years so they've been knowing what's coming because they're shutting us down alex not
[1:54:29.360 --> 1:54:33.920]  i know they're shutting america down but get back i held you over to tell me the plot of this
[1:54:33.920 --> 1:54:41.360]  this show called first wave i never saw the plot of the show is that there's this alien race
[1:54:42.400 --> 1:54:50.480]  that wants to conquer the earth by whatever means necessary there they are doing a nanotechnology
[1:54:50.480 --> 1:54:56.000]  engineering they're using sound waves to to manipulate the populace they're they're using
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:01.600]  weather weapons in the show and you know i was revisiting the show and i'm like let me look at
[1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:08.640]  it again and it's everything that you've covered over the past 30 years alex it's exactly what the
[1:55:08.640 --> 1:55:15.360]  globalists are doing and it's like these people that wrote the show wrote it to give us or tell us
[1:55:15.360 --> 1:55:19.920]  or do predictive programming or maybe they were trying to tell us like guys this is what's coming
[1:55:20.640 --> 1:55:27.760]  these guys these people are evil these demonic entities from another universe or that are here
[1:55:27.760 --> 1:55:31.680]  we just haven't been able to see them from a parallel universe that's running together with us
[1:55:31.680 --> 1:55:36.960]  or maybe not parallel but an interdimension your being is trying to take us over and i think that's
[1:55:36.960 --> 1:55:42.800]  who's running kao Schwab himself alex well there's no doubt they say they're getting rid of humans
[1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:46.720]  they're going to merge the machines and that the humans are obsolete i mean it's incredible thank

[2:00:36.960 --> 2:00:45.200]  calls al in florida you're on the welcome hey alex welcome sir hey so i just wanted to bring up a
[2:00:45.200 --> 2:00:52.560]  key piece of information that i think was overlooked by the sandy hook trial um so still to today fbi.gov
[2:00:52.560 --> 2:01:00.560]  has the uniform crime report and if you look up sandy hook canalik in 2012 it still says zero murders
[2:01:00.560 --> 2:01:08.400]  and manslaughter in that category so the fbi confirms that nobody died at sandy hook in
[2:01:08.400 --> 2:01:16.080]  connecticut 2012 even if you go to 2013 because it happened in december still it's a big goose egg
[2:01:16.080 --> 2:01:24.080]  nobody died this is very specific information from the fbi confirming nobody died in sandy hook
[2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:31.920]  yeah no that that actually was brought up during the so-called uh kangaroo trial and the thing is
[2:01:31.920 --> 2:01:37.200]  they say the state of connecticut doesn't report deaths of the fbi doesn't put them in there but
[2:01:37.200 --> 2:01:41.600]  that's why people are asking questions one of the reasons i appreciate your call uh let's go
[2:01:41.600 --> 2:01:49.360]  ahead and talk to erin in wisconsin erin go ahead hey jones uh i just wanted to talk about
[2:01:49.360 --> 2:01:54.720]  something i saw on friday evening i was watching one fighting championships at the mixed martial
[2:01:54.720 --> 2:02:00.880]  arts promotion out of asia and they had their first event on amazon and one of their main sponsors
[2:02:00.880 --> 2:02:08.240]  even on the page for their uh the one fc website is globalcitizen.org and naturally you know being a
[2:02:08.240 --> 2:02:14.000]  viewer of your show this kind of struck a chord so i went to the site to check it out and you can go
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:19.520]  and look and read all these wonderful articles like five ways our lives would include i'm sorry
[2:02:19.520 --> 2:02:26.160]  improved in a circular economy and this is clout swabs you'll own nothing you'll be happy about it
[2:02:26.160 --> 2:02:32.400]  and this article goes on to say how the world bank estimates that americans produce all this waste and
[2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:38.560]  but you know what they don't say is this is how they've set the system up so this is how we this
[2:02:38.560 --> 2:02:44.960]  is how we behave this is how we act and now it's all our fault they kind of sidestep blame it's
[2:02:44.960 --> 2:02:50.320]  everything that you're always talking about that they built up this system for us to be in and now
[2:02:50.320 --> 2:02:56.160]  they use that as the reason why they need to get all of us under control we're all dangerous you
[2:02:56.160 --> 2:03:01.600]  know all the all throughout history that that's what the elites have said that 95 of us are dangerous
[2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:09.520]  to ourselves and into the future of the human race and also i was listening to uh richard grove
[2:03:09.520 --> 2:03:16.720]  interview john taylor gato the ultimate history lesson are you familiar with that yes and i mean
[2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:23.040]  this i would recommend that people go and listen to this it's five hours full of everything from
[2:03:23.040 --> 2:03:28.720]  the history of public education in this country and how we're just kind of set up to fail and
[2:03:28.720 --> 2:03:34.640]  and i believe that if you can learn this you can kind of get out ahead of it and you can you can learn
[2:03:34.640 --> 2:03:41.200]  to get out of this way of thinking and actually you know make some real change and act some real
[2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:47.920]  change in our own lives and to try to prevent or mitigate some of what these people are are trying
[2:03:47.920 --> 2:03:53.840]  to do to us you know the world economic forum all the usual suspects so that's about it that go
[2:03:53.840 --> 2:03:58.720]  check out that globalcitizen.org they're just kind of stuffing it down our throat every everywhere they
[2:03:58.720 --> 2:04:01.840]  can oh and they just announced world government we're getting rid of the humans we're going to cut

[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:28.560]  coveted as a lab made product and she's been exposing the deadly shots she is now completely
[2:06:28.560 --> 2:06:34.080]  and totally absolutely vindicated in triplicate i'm going to go over some of the big developments
[2:06:34.080 --> 2:06:39.840]  that have just unfolded but i just want to out of the gates go right to her to talk about the
[2:06:39.840 --> 2:06:45.200]  state of the world and what's coming next she's got a dna strand behind her of your tv viewer
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:53.120]  and they're now announcing that these dna swabs these cobit tests we took at universities and
[2:06:53.120 --> 2:06:58.400]  medical centers and you name it we're actually sent to a dna database got a big stack of news
[2:06:58.400 --> 2:07:05.360]  on that this is part of a massive globalist takeover there is no doubt so so dr lee merit thanks
[2:07:05.360 --> 2:07:11.360]  for having us on why don't you give folks the 35 000 foot view then we'll zoom in with a microscope
[2:07:11.360 --> 2:07:19.920]  and look at the specifics well uh the 30 000 foot view may be a quote from eggurell and po that i
[2:07:19.920 --> 2:07:25.040]  i've become insane with long intervals and horrible sanity it just seems like every time we turn
[2:07:25.040 --> 2:07:32.640]  around it gets more confusing um you know the real issue is there is this really even a genetic war
[2:07:32.640 --> 2:07:38.960]  i've had this dna strand behind me but you know we're we're not finding dna in the vials of of
[2:07:38.960 --> 2:07:45.680]  these vaccines i think what if the in the real quick summary of this i think there's a lot of
[2:07:46.320 --> 2:07:52.000]  misdirection and i think they've got us looking one way when we need to be really looking at
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:57.040]  another way and that's wavelength um we talked about it on the show here a long time ago about
[2:07:57.040 --> 2:08:04.240]  the implication of 5g but i honestly i didn't realize how you know i still thought there were
[2:08:04.240 --> 2:08:10.080]  viruses and dna was like i was taught now i'm not sure no no they know it's not blood clots it's
[2:08:10.080 --> 2:08:15.120]  artificial circuitry confirmed by hundreds of prestigious universities you name it growing
[2:08:15.120 --> 2:08:21.520]  in the body it's just causing blood clots right and i have to say the one thing i can be absolutely
[2:08:21.520 --> 2:08:27.760]  sure of and your previous caller brought this up is that schools have failed us but it wasn't by accident
[2:08:28.320 --> 2:08:32.880]  you know a lack of knowledge you have a you have mark pass you on here every once in a while and
[2:08:32.880 --> 2:08:39.120]  i really like mark pass you but he has a two hour excellent excellent everybody should watch this um
[2:08:39.120 --> 2:08:46.400]  video on on demystifying the occult and occult just means hidden and i will tell you that they've
[2:08:46.400 --> 2:08:52.880]  hidden so much from us that is very hard to get a handle on what is true that's really our problem
[2:08:52.880 --> 2:09:00.880]  well that's right so so dive right into it dr merit well you know um i the the thing that came
[2:09:00.880 --> 2:09:06.080]  first of all there's been some issues of just you know the whole genetic thing what's really going
[2:09:06.080 --> 2:09:12.880]  on here it's a couple things didn't make sense like um you know in 2017 i know that they had a
[2:09:12.880 --> 2:09:20.240]  they they they were doing these hygiene therapies and we've been spending three billion dollars in
[2:09:20.240 --> 2:09:24.960]  genetics research every year but for that only about three percent actually goes to anything
[2:09:24.960 --> 2:09:31.600]  real any anything used in medicine now they claim that they've made a genetic vaccine here that goes
[2:09:31.600 --> 2:09:37.120]  out in the whole world but i looked it up the cost of a genetic therapy in 2017 the one that they
[2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:43.120]  kind of touted as being the the prototype it was somewhere between 800 000 and a million dollars
[2:09:44.080 --> 2:09:48.880]  now something isn't ringing right here how can they then just suddenly within a couple years
[2:09:48.880 --> 2:09:54.560]  make this so cost effective they can do a gene treatment the genetic based therapy on the whole
[2:09:54.560 --> 2:10:02.480]  world there's something not right here and then you have um you know i also uh feng zhang of the
[2:10:02.480 --> 2:10:09.840]  zhang lab at mit now he has a he has a he's a he's what they call a biological engineer he's got a
[2:10:09.840 --> 2:10:15.680]  phd in biological engineering which is a little creepy but he's always cited as being one of the
[2:10:15.680 --> 2:10:21.680]  premier genetic manipulators having been the pioneer of crisper but you know if you go on
[2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:27.040]  his site and you actually read what it says it says that he i'll quote it it says although we
[2:10:27.040 --> 2:10:33.120]  typically talk about gene editing in reality we mostly do gene deleting our ability to precisely
[2:10:33.120 --> 2:10:40.880]  integrate new stretches of dna is limited so and then the final issue here is i interviewed
[2:10:40.880 --> 2:10:46.800]  dr. porna mawag you may have seen a small snippet of her on the internet but on my rumble i've got
[2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:52.800]  a two hour video so people can really watch and hear her for themselves so they get the understanding
[2:10:52.800 --> 2:10:59.280]  because there are 18 lab researchers she's a phd in virology there's there are labs researchers
[2:10:59.280 --> 2:11:04.800]  all over the world that have come up and said there is no genetic material in this in these
[2:11:04.800 --> 2:11:11.200]  vaccines and that's not one that is going to be too mushy mushy that's one of those things where
[2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:17.920]  we understand um you know electrophoresis gel electrophoresis it's a simple way of separating
[2:11:17.920 --> 2:11:24.240]  molecules if it's there we would have seen they should have seen it secondly we have a technique
[2:11:24.240 --> 2:11:30.240]  called the ramen spectroscopy so i'm i'm telling you they really looked at this that also can be
[2:11:30.240 --> 2:11:39.280]  very precise at looking at molecules using their um their refraction i guess using laser light so
[2:11:39.280 --> 2:11:44.400]  they did not find genetic material in these vials of vaccine and they looked at they looked at uh
[2:11:44.400 --> 2:11:49.280]  the sputnik they looked at synovac they looked at all of these different well didn't they didn't
[2:11:49.280 --> 2:11:56.400]  they just simply find outside material that cuts dna like you said they're not manipulating dna
[2:11:56.400 --> 2:12:02.640]  they're cutting dna that causes mutation and cancer well they're doing something and the question is
[2:12:03.360 --> 2:12:10.880]  is it really genetic based um so what they're what they found in the vaccines so far and this is
[2:12:10.880 --> 2:12:17.840]  labs in germany india all over um they found it's a base they're all the same they say the
[2:12:17.840 --> 2:12:25.040]  vaccines are all the same they're a basis of hydrogel with reduced graphene oxide and then
[2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:31.520]  they've got a variety of metals in it now you know the one thing i can tell you for sure about
[2:12:31.520 --> 2:12:38.880]  graphene oxide is it is not safe you know you look at it and yes it has a lot of potential
[2:12:38.880 --> 2:12:46.000]  they say a lot of potential for for all sorts of uh interventions into humans the problem is
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:52.320]  it really has lots and lots of problems and and if you think about it it does a lot of the things
[2:12:52.320 --> 2:12:58.640]  that we're seeing the clotting the neurologic damage it's been it's been shown to to um you know
[2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:05.840]  give you abnormal immune responses i mean and and so why is it's a big mystery all these labs
[2:13:05.840 --> 2:13:09.680]  around the world have found it's triggering the body not just what they inject but using
[2:13:09.680 --> 2:13:15.840]  your own body's chemicals to start growing these these these complexes inside the body
[2:13:15.840 --> 2:13:19.920]  we know that's happening the question is what is it for and why do they have all four vaccines that
[2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:26.800]  were backed by the NIH to cause this right again because they're all the same essentially and they
[2:13:26.800 --> 2:13:31.440]  their their purpose was never let's just keep in mind we also have to have a correct world view
[2:13:31.440 --> 2:13:36.480]  that they were never here to help us this has never been about making anybody safer if you look at the
[2:13:36.480 --> 2:13:42.560]  tragedy of the child vaccine program uh they're they've they've increased your doctor you're
[2:13:42.560 --> 2:13:45.280]  gonna have the floor when we come back i'm gonna think i'm gonna let you house i'm just sit back
[2:13:45.280 --> 2:13:51.200]  and turn my mic off but pulling back to at the 30 000 foot view as i said you don't want to extrapolate
[2:13:51.200 --> 2:13:56.240]  you know give your opinion but clearly you're a smart lady what is this really about building
[2:13:56.240 --> 2:14:01.200]  capacitors into us changing the life form because that's what class swap says we're going to go in your
[2:14:01.200 --> 2:14:04.560]  bodies we're going to change who you are we're going to make you be ready to interface with
[2:14:04.560 --> 2:14:07.920]  machines and it looks like that's what this does and a bunch of people are going to be killed in the
[2:14:07.920 --> 2:14:13.600]  process i think that's pretty close to the to write on and i think they're using the graphene
[2:14:13.600 --> 2:14:20.560]  somehow to as a transformative agent in other words it can it can transform gigahertz to
[2:14:20.560 --> 2:14:26.560]  terahertz to run nanobots it's an all it's an electrical receptacle so they're putting a receptor
[2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:32.960]  in for nanobots and electromagnetic energy yep and 5g will coordinate it that's why they need
[2:14:32.960 --> 2:14:37.120]  five so to dumb it down they're putting the plug into us they're they're putting the interface in
[2:14:38.240 --> 2:14:42.640]  yeah anybody that says oh they're going to put a chip in you that's old news they don't need a chip
[2:14:42.640 --> 2:14:48.720]  all they need is this microscopic system injected over time i don't think the good news is i don't
[2:14:48.720 --> 2:14:52.320]  think they can do it in one piece and you've all heard already said that he said we're going to put
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:58.400]  nanotech in you to interface yep i think that's what it is i don't think it has it doesn't have
[2:14:58.400 --> 2:15:03.360]  any other uh if they look if they wanted to just kill us outright they could have done that a long
[2:15:03.360 --> 2:15:08.240]  time ago we know that i mean there's so many technologies out there that are just completely
[2:15:08.240 --> 2:15:13.760]  world busting technologies uh you know tesla's death ray but they're but that's not what they're
[2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:19.680]  doing they're they're doing this to um first of all i think they love our misery there's somebody
[2:15:19.680 --> 2:15:24.800]  out there that just feeds on our misery but because it's just been horrible experience right but the
[2:15:24.800 --> 2:15:29.280]  second thing is they're going to take away some of our population we saw the guide stones and they're
[2:15:29.280 --> 2:15:35.440]  going to transform people look what's you know if anybody's seen westworld what what's westworld
[2:15:35.440 --> 2:15:40.400]  really telling us it says there are people that look like us that talk like us that walk like us
[2:15:40.400 --> 2:15:47.200]  this is the protagonist said this but they're not us and what's if you look at that show the new
[2:15:47.200 --> 2:15:53.120]  westworld it shows that they for every robot that are synthetic they have to make a lot of they have
[2:15:53.120 --> 2:15:57.920]  to have a lot of humans tending it stay right there we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen if
[2:15:57.920 --> 2:16:02.240]  millions of people get this book our funding problems will be over and it's starting to happen
[2:16:02.240 --> 2:16:05.840]  that's why i said yeah go to info wars tour dot com get the book and start shipping in a couple
[2:16:05.840 --> 2:16:10.000]  weeks the great reset in the war for the world but i said go to amazon because it's the number one
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:15.920]  book chart in the world and if it goes to number one not a political not of history not of us history
[2:16:15.920 --> 2:16:20.800]  it's already number one over 40 categories like political science you name it 40 plus categories
[2:16:20.800 --> 2:16:28.160]  it's number one ladies and gentlemen drum roll please of books in the world the great reset in
[2:16:28.160 --> 2:16:36.160]  the war for the world is one two three four five six seven eight nine we are now number nine in the
[2:16:36.160 --> 2:16:43.120]  world whoo this is major this is political this could fund our war chest just go to amazon.com
[2:16:43.120 --> 2:16:49.360]  everybody and buy 10 copies send this blueprint to the death star and the new world order because
[2:16:49.360 --> 2:16:53.120]  you read this you know their whole plan how to stop them hit the great reset in the world now
[2:16:53.120 --> 2:17:00.720]  it's gonna go to number one what do you make of that seven months ago in december of 2021
[2:17:00.720 --> 2:17:06.960]  we launched the first in the three coin founding member series george washington slaying the dragon
[2:17:06.960 --> 2:17:11.360]  then we launched the tree of liberty coin and finally the second amendment come and take it
[2:17:11.360 --> 2:17:20.800]  molan lobby coin there are only 75 points left in the three-point series exclusively right now
[2:17:20.800 --> 2:17:28.080]  at 1776point.com and for the final 75 people become founding members for this big project
[2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:33.200]  we're launching in the near future you'll also get a personal signed piece of art i made of the
[2:17:33.200 --> 2:17:38.800]  sheepdog chasing the wolf and a personal message it's your last chance to get all three coins
[2:17:38.800 --> 2:17:47.600]  at 1776point.com this is history happening now info war station support is changing the world
[2:17:47.600 --> 2:17:59.200]  and this is the final 75 three-point set exclusively available at 1776point.com we are now living in
[2:17:59.200 --> 2:18:06.400]  the void sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what we've known and what's to come
[2:18:06.400 --> 2:18:13.760]  and right now the most important thing to remember is don't panic stay calm because now is the time
[2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:20.560]  that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe sound course there is nothing stopping
[2:18:20.560 --> 2:18:27.360]  we the people from making our own rules and building our own society all we got to do is
[2:18:27.360 --> 2:18:34.080]  survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare the world fiat currency system
[2:18:34.080 --> 2:18:41.360]  is racing towards zero it's time to convert it into hard assets now including food water and
[2:18:41.360 --> 2:18:48.400]  survival gear to keep us strong and at the ready go to preparetoday.com for the essentials

[2:20:01.600 --> 2:20:21.920]  New World Order it's Alex Jones. Dr. Lee Merritt's our guest here on the Alex Jones show the third
[2:20:21.920 --> 2:20:26.800]  hour she's a visionary medical doctor a military veteran and she's been the tip of the spear exposing
[2:20:26.800 --> 2:20:32.320]  all this it's on the shut up during this segment and the next and just let her host and and and
[2:20:32.320 --> 2:20:38.480]  start over and lay all this out because it's so big and I've studied it myself it's not a really
[2:20:38.480 --> 2:20:44.880]  even a gene therapy like they say it just cuts your DNA it just kills your DNA but it also
[2:20:44.880 --> 2:20:50.480]  rewires you and some people to grow faster some slower they're testing on us all like guinea
[2:20:50.480 --> 2:20:57.920]  pigs and we've got claw swaps saying it's a revolution taking us over Dr. Merritt please continue well
[2:20:57.920 --> 2:21:04.480]  thank you I um so I basically I tell people we need to change our language so we understand what's
[2:21:04.480 --> 2:21:11.040]  going on the idea we keep talking about these viruses but quite frankly we have we have some
[2:21:11.040 --> 2:21:16.480]  proven technology that can cause disease but what is unproven is viral transmission especially airborne
[2:21:16.480 --> 2:21:22.720]  viral disease so let's let's turn our thinking more and let's move over to the idea that they're
[2:21:22.720 --> 2:21:29.840]  using toxins against us you know in latin uh virus means toxin and in ancient medicine the only two
[2:21:29.840 --> 2:21:35.520]  treatments are purification and detoxification and we've lost sight of that and we've gone to this
[2:21:35.520 --> 2:21:40.080]  idea that that these little antimicules float out of our mouth and make people sick and everybody
[2:21:40.080 --> 2:21:45.120]  says well but I know people get sick yes but you can get sick for other reasons and I think I want
[2:21:45.120 --> 2:21:49.440]  to start there actually because it leads into all this and it's maybe not what you're going to expect
[2:21:49.440 --> 2:21:56.560]  but there in the 1930s and 1920s in in Russia in the Soviet Union and trust me the Russians are way
[2:21:56.560 --> 2:22:01.920]  ahead of us on this research or at least way ahead of what we're being told we have there was a guy
[2:22:01.920 --> 2:22:08.240]  named Kosnachev and this is what he did he he took a tissue and he divided it in two parts
[2:22:08.240 --> 2:22:14.400]  and he put cells into one container from half of the tissue and cells in a container B let's say
[2:22:14.400 --> 2:22:20.240]  from the other the other cells and then he connected them and the only thing that connected them in
[2:22:20.240 --> 2:22:24.960]  it was in one now one chamber but separated between the tissues was an optical window
[2:22:25.840 --> 2:22:30.720]  then he took the first side of these cells and he blasted them with let's say a radiation I mean
[2:22:30.720 --> 2:22:37.120]  he killed he was going to murder the cells some way either with radiation uh staphococci he could
[2:22:37.120 --> 2:22:44.320]  put in bacteria he could put in arsenic you name it whatever he put into side one then he watched
[2:22:44.320 --> 2:22:50.960]  what 12 hours later he watched to see if side two started changing well if the window glass
[2:22:50.960 --> 2:22:56.720]  was glass between those two chambers nothing happened but when he put in quartz he started
[2:22:56.720 --> 2:23:02.160]  to see an effect and what the effect was and it was subsequently called the mitogenic effect or my
[2:23:02.160 --> 2:23:09.520]  favorite is death photons what he what he showed was that side B starts dying using the same pattern
[2:23:09.520 --> 2:23:15.200]  of death if it was radiation side B started dying from radiation if it was arsenic side B started
[2:23:15.200 --> 2:23:23.600]  tying with the same symptoms of arsenic death okay so so whatever was killing side A moved over to
[2:23:23.600 --> 2:23:28.960]  side B when they weren't physically correct connected they were connected by an optical quartz
[2:23:28.960 --> 2:23:36.400]  window and that quartz window allowed the UV the difference between quartz and glasses quartz allows
[2:23:36.400 --> 2:23:41.760]  ultraviolet or near ultraviolet rays to get through so that's why they named them the death
[2:23:41.760 --> 2:23:47.280]  photons because they said something is being given off by these cells that is causing these
[2:23:47.280 --> 2:23:54.800]  other cells to get sick now if we take a step back and we say look if they can if they can if this
[2:23:54.800 --> 2:24:00.320]  is happening and we know that it has an electromagnetic signature and we can capture that electric
[2:24:00.320 --> 2:24:07.120]  magnetic signature just like Luc Montagnier so it showed and others then we could we could program
[2:24:07.120 --> 2:24:13.360]  and we could broadcast disease when people say well if there are no viruses how can I get sick
[2:24:13.360 --> 2:24:21.520]  I'm going to tell you this is how now royal rife um yeah they did a lot royal rife um was doing
[2:24:21.520 --> 2:24:28.560]  the opposite royal rife was a very well known scientist also about the same time he developed
[2:24:28.560 --> 2:24:36.720]  a microscope of 50 or 5780 some parts that he handmade that had all quartz optics and quartz
[2:24:36.720 --> 2:24:43.280]  allowed you to see all this radiation all I mean all the UV light all this different wavelengths
[2:24:43.280 --> 2:24:50.880]  now he could get 15 000 um magnification off a light microscope what can we get today
[2:24:50.880 --> 2:24:56.720]  100 years later we're we're stuck yes there's a picture of royal rife who's uh who was born
[2:24:56.720 --> 2:25:04.400]  near where my office is actually but he here he is in 1929 now we are in 2022 and we are still
[2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:10.320]  hampered by having light microscopes that don't use a complete quartz system don't use his patented
[2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:15.680]  lighting and we can get maybe 2500 but what did he tell us well he told us a lot of things and
[2:25:15.680 --> 2:25:20.640]  think if we'd gone down this road he said that he could watch with his microscope and this is
[2:25:20.640 --> 2:25:26.640]  pretty impressive in the days before fully catheters he sat there for over 24 hours sometimes
[2:25:26.640 --> 2:25:33.200]  36 hours I guess without moving to observe the live bacteria and what he showed is that bacteria
[2:25:33.200 --> 2:25:39.120]  had a had what they call a pleomorphic phase in other words bacteria would morph into viruses and
[2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:44.560]  back again into bacteria what he called viruses now they were smaller things that were moving
[2:25:44.560 --> 2:25:49.840]  around he called them viruses but they aren't what we call viruses and the other thing he noticed
[2:25:49.840 --> 2:25:54.560]  was that all these different things whether it was tuberculosis or staphylococci whichever one it
[2:25:54.560 --> 2:25:59.920]  was they have a specific wavelength they had a different color so a different color meant a
[2:25:59.920 --> 2:26:06.880]  different wavelength and so he developed the what he called the mortal oscillatory resonance or
[2:26:06.880 --> 2:26:11.920]  MOR it was a complementary wavelength or a non-complementary that could blast these things and
[2:26:11.920 --> 2:26:17.360]  kill them there's a famous story I don't think it's apocryphal I think this really happened
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:23.600]  he went to multiple radio stations in San Diego near where his lab was and he asked him if they all
[2:26:23.600 --> 2:26:29.520]  simultaneously on one day would broadcast a particular frequency a particular sound for
[2:26:29.520 --> 2:26:34.480]  a particular period of time and after it was over he announced he said there we have just cured
[2:26:34.480 --> 2:26:41.840]  tuberculosis in San Diego because what he showed is that if you find the right the right frequency
[2:26:41.840 --> 2:26:47.680]  you can do lots of things so he was doing good but there's a potential to do evil so I'm just
[2:26:47.680 --> 2:26:52.400]  going to say we we have been this knowledge has been hidden from us but it was not hidden from
[2:26:52.400 --> 2:26:59.760]  the Germans for example they were doing it um Koznochev's work was we uh looked at in a famous
[2:26:59.760 --> 2:27:04.240]  lab in Germany and guess what it was called it was called Marburg and what do we think about
[2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:08.800]  Marburg we hear about Marburg we hear about a virus of Marburg but to be honest there are less
[2:27:08.800 --> 2:27:16.160]  than 600 cases of Marburg in the world what's really going on here so let's say you so I personally
[2:27:16.160 --> 2:27:24.320]  think we are looking at wavelength medicine and we're looking at wavelength medical warfare
[2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:34.160]  and ultimately we are DNA we are we are wavelength beings and we can be manipulated that way well
[2:27:34.160 --> 2:27:40.080]  they know DNA is a is a is a transceiver and I remember going to telegraph is in the reports
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:45.200]  when a when a sperm breaks into the egg there is a pulse of energy and they don't even know
[2:27:45.200 --> 2:27:49.440]  quote where it comes from there's like an interdimensional releases and electromagnetically
[2:27:49.440 --> 2:27:54.560]  releases and we know that we're electrochemical that's how our cells operate but they ignore all
[2:27:54.560 --> 2:27:58.880]  that in so-called mainline science because we know from Tesla and others it's the real science
[2:27:59.920 --> 2:28:04.560]  right and that spark I believe is what they call that's why they called it the mitogenic effect
[2:28:04.560 --> 2:28:11.200]  the Russians actually discovered that and so um I think that there's a lot of potential there now
[2:28:11.200 --> 2:28:16.640]  that gets us back to the whole issue of what are what are we facing we're facing what happened during
[2:28:16.640 --> 2:28:22.560]  the COVID lockdowns well they put up all these 5g towers that that that should have been a suspicious
[2:28:22.560 --> 2:28:27.920]  moment to begin with the second thing is when now we're finding out there's no there's no genetic
[2:28:27.920 --> 2:28:35.040]  material in the vaccines there's graphene reduced graphene oxide now graphene oxide I'm not I'm not
[2:28:35.040 --> 2:28:41.120]  you know I know Dr. Nolak the the German scientist the German doctor that died was talking about this
[2:28:41.120 --> 2:28:46.400]  razor blade effect but quite frankly graphene oxide is so so tiny I'm not sure that's really
[2:28:46.400 --> 2:28:51.680]  what's going on here I don't I'm not buying that it's slicing anything um except maybe
[2:28:51.680 --> 2:28:56.320]  maybe DNA it may damage the other merits stay there this is fascinating we're right back
[2:28:57.600 --> 2:29:04.560]  just look at these headlines from Reuters world faces unprecedented global hunger crisis
[2:29:04.560 --> 2:29:11.440]  UN chief says going into 2023 world food program warns of global food catastrophe

[2:31:01.920 --> 2:31:09.280]  all that uh what they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics
[2:31:09.280 --> 2:31:17.360]  of signal not noise if you look at the signal and you compare that to pbs and npr and bbc and

[2:31:31.040 --> 2:31:35.360]  of this not only that he kind of explained it you are one of the great thinkers of this
[2:31:35.360 --> 2:31:39.360]  that is very rare you've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation
[2:31:39.920 --> 2:31:44.480]  and see that in this new book i got to tell you when tony line's first approach me i read this
[2:31:44.480 --> 2:31:49.520]  thing i go this is this is no beetry you're not going to be flipping pages or you're going to be
[2:31:49.520 --> 2:31:55.280]  having a pin out you're going to be underlying stuff the great reset by alex jones order your

[2:33:01.040 --> 2:33:15.360]  the new world order it's alex jones we've been told it's genetic or either with the republic
[2:33:15.360 --> 2:33:24.560]  or against it resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones we've been told this is
[2:33:24.560 --> 2:33:28.880]  genetic revolution we've been told our bodies are being taken over by the club of rome and
[2:33:28.880 --> 2:33:34.080]  davos group at the u n and now they're doing it under league merit medical doctor is here laying
[2:33:34.080 --> 2:33:40.160]  out what's really in these so-called shots that have killed so many people the whole separate
[2:33:40.160 --> 2:33:45.200]  subject that we've been vindicated and we've all been confirmed to be accurate that you're nine out of
[2:33:45.200 --> 2:33:50.240]  ten dying of coveted they say are dying from the shots that's a british medical journal
[2:33:50.240 --> 2:33:54.480]  it's all coming out they don't care they got caught that's the whole other subject where is
[2:33:54.480 --> 2:34:00.080]  this going next but what are the shots actually really do and why would they risk global rebellion
[2:34:00.080 --> 2:34:07.040]  to put these in us dr lee merit please continue yeah well i i don't know if you want to talk
[2:34:07.040 --> 2:34:11.440]  a little bit more about the shots but i i was talking about whatever you want doctor well i'm
[2:34:11.440 --> 2:34:16.720]  i'm going to just proceed on a little bit with this nano technology issue and the and the issue of
[2:34:16.720 --> 2:34:22.640]  it not being primarily genetic modification necessarily as we think of it and i was saying
[2:34:22.640 --> 2:34:28.960]  i love that you played the westworld theme because really i think that's telling us things
[2:34:29.680 --> 2:34:34.720]  if you look at westworld it's very expensive to maintain synthetic robots wouldn't it be a
[2:34:34.720 --> 2:34:40.800]  lot cheaper if they could just put something here to control me i mean that's really where this goes
[2:34:40.800 --> 2:34:44.400]  i think is that no that's right we don't that's what claus swabb set up with the clip at the first
[2:34:44.400 --> 2:34:51.200]  hour we're going to make humans the commodity the revolution is taking humans over right i mean i i
[2:34:51.200 --> 2:34:56.560]  think that in my mind i used to think the world was uh courier and ives and norman rockwell and
[2:34:56.560 --> 2:35:02.400]  unfortunately you were right long ago when you pointed out these the the statue of mo lock at
[2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:08.240]  our at our bohemian grove because the world is more like that we are we are dealing with we are
[2:35:08.240 --> 2:35:14.560]  serfs in a world that we have not understood and it's a criminal it's a horrible uh situation
[2:35:14.560 --> 2:35:19.120]  that were kept here by tax bondage and lack of knowledge so we have to understand this and the
[2:35:19.120 --> 2:35:23.680]  lack of knowledge is leading to the what i'm about to talk about and that's called the rise of the
[2:35:23.680 --> 2:35:30.640]  nano mafia okay there's a doctor and i just found this because i actually was looking up the kazarian
[2:35:30.640 --> 2:35:35.680]  mafia or something i was looking up some mafia point and this palm before you get there they don't
[2:35:35.680 --> 2:35:40.640]  want to just have all our data they want to make us the data right we're going to be the data and
[2:35:40.640 --> 2:35:47.040]  we're going to be the robots because we self assemble we self reproduce we can take care of ourselves
[2:35:47.040 --> 2:35:51.680]  and then they can kill us off when they want and we can just be controlled i think that's where this
[2:35:51.680 --> 2:35:57.680]  goes so there's a doctor i believe he's a doctor he's at the faculty of medicine at the national
[2:35:57.680 --> 2:36:04.000]  university in my order to son marcos peru anyways names david floris and he wrote an article that
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:08.400]  that came out on in the international physical medicine rehabilitation journal and the name
[2:36:08.400 --> 2:36:14.160]  of the article is the nano mafia nano technologies global network of organized crime and here's
[2:36:14.160 --> 2:36:18.800]  basically what he said and and i'll see one of the reasons he wrote this is he was just kind of
[2:36:18.800 --> 2:36:22.800]  upset that people he thought were getting the Nobel prize in medicine and physiology
[2:36:22.800 --> 2:36:28.240]  and they were doing work on on essentially on unwitting
[2:36:30.480 --> 2:36:34.960]  patients on people that just like the death camps in in germany the people that were
[2:36:34.960 --> 2:36:40.160]  compelled to be in these and maybe not even know it or like the cia experimenting years ago
[2:36:40.160 --> 2:36:44.960]  with lsd and they they dosed people without them knowing it it's totally unethical and he didn't
[2:36:44.960 --> 2:36:50.320]  want people to be getting them the Nobel prize for this but anyway what what he said he says
[2:36:50.320 --> 2:36:54.240]  this is happening in south america it's really kind of starting there because they have the cartel
[2:36:54.240 --> 2:37:00.800]  experience that if you're going to work in your if you're a high-tech biotech research arm and
[2:37:00.800 --> 2:37:05.600]  you've got these grants and you've got this money but you can't get people to want to have nanobots
[2:37:05.600 --> 2:37:10.800]  put in their brain this is about nanobots there are orders of magnitude smaller than anything
[2:37:10.800 --> 2:37:15.600]  we're talking with chip technology so these are things that travel through your bloodstream you
[2:37:15.600 --> 2:37:21.280]  can't really see them with a naked eye and really can't see them they're below microscopic levels
[2:37:21.280 --> 2:37:25.920]  so these are very very tiny so they didn't but people don't want to be dosed for this as an
[2:37:25.920 --> 2:37:31.680]  experiment no matter how much you pay them for the most part so they got in bed with the cartels
[2:37:31.680 --> 2:37:38.080]  and they got involuntary subjects and what he's saying is you don't need injections to get these
[2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:46.080]  nanobots into people they actually believe that beer is the best best way to do it so what the
[2:37:46.080 --> 2:37:50.880]  what the cartels or what the criminal element that was involved in this figured out is that they
[2:37:50.880 --> 2:37:57.440]  could use it as nanotechnology as a criminal in their toolbox right as a weapon you know you
[2:37:57.440 --> 2:38:02.080]  don't have to go now i don't have to go and i don't have to use guns and violence and and it's
[2:38:02.080 --> 2:38:08.640]  very messy to try and rob a bank all i have to do is take the bank ceo ceo out and dose him
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:13.040]  in a beer you know have him have a drink of a beer and have him dose it apparently beer works well
[2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:19.280]  because you know beer kind of has has things that open up your gut a little bit and open up your
[2:38:19.280 --> 2:38:23.920]  blood brain barrier it disinhibits you a little bit and apparently this the the idea is to put
[2:38:23.920 --> 2:38:30.160]  these nanotechnology devices in our brain and that was the new james bond movie was all about
[2:38:30.160 --> 2:38:36.960]  nanotech yeah i i interviewed j dire on you what you've had you've had he he does some of your
[2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:42.080]  programs and he's really interesting on predictive programming and i started going back and looking
[2:38:42.080 --> 2:38:50.560]  at this stuff and and all through the last decades of movies and mostly i watch tv old tv shows they
[2:38:50.560 --> 2:38:56.880]  tell you over and over that that we have people among us that are not us and why do they do that
[2:38:56.880 --> 2:39:02.240]  why do they have a need to tell us what they're doing to program or subconscious yeah that's
[2:39:02.240 --> 2:39:06.960]  what i think he thinks it is programming it's subconscious i'm not sure it isn't just a you
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:13.840]  know the the old the the the religious you know idea that if i tell you what i'm going to do and
[2:39:13.840 --> 2:39:19.280]  then you stupidly do it i'm not guilty i i think this is a i think this is the way that it's a
[2:39:19.280 --> 2:39:25.520]  free will issue it's a free will issue and unfortunately what we've seen you know we always
[2:39:25.520 --> 2:39:31.440]  used to wonder as a child of the of the fifties that was not too far after world war two i remember
[2:39:31.440 --> 2:39:36.080]  my father who was a physician small town doc and his buddy sitting around talking about how could
[2:39:36.080 --> 2:39:40.640]  it when the when the word started coming out what had happened in nazi germany they kept saying how
[2:39:40.640 --> 2:39:46.240]  could this have happened how could this have happened well i think we now know and if if you're
[2:39:46.240 --> 2:39:51.600]  paying it and we've now got not only corrupt researchers we've got in corrupt governments
[2:39:51.600 --> 2:39:58.240]  goes without saying but we have corrupt hospital administrators health unions um professors every
[2:39:58.240 --> 2:40:04.320]  you know we've got a we've got the organization and it isn't you know it's not what we expected
[2:40:04.320 --> 2:40:08.320]  you know when they said we took an oath to defend the constitution against all enemies foreign and
[2:40:08.320 --> 2:40:14.160]  domestic i didn't really expect it would be domestic medical authority but that's what it's
[2:40:14.160 --> 2:40:20.320]  turned out to be and now they're using it for other things now you notice in canada um and i think
[2:40:20.320 --> 2:40:25.040]  it's a combination it's a control we're going to be controlled by this technology if we don't stop it
[2:40:25.600 --> 2:40:28.880]  and i think there's a way out to stop it but we're going to be controlled if we don't stop it and
[2:40:28.880 --> 2:40:34.640]  there's also depopulation there's no question this is about depopulation and and you know in
[2:40:34.640 --> 2:40:40.240]  canada right now i think i heard the number 30 but for sure what's happening is that elderly
[2:40:40.240 --> 2:40:46.000]  going into canadian hospitals are being offered euthanasia oh travel came out two weeks ago and
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:50.800]  said we're going to push euthanasia on people that's right and that's what they're doing i
[2:40:50.800 --> 2:40:57.120]  heard 30 we're offered euthanasia so what's the point there it's because all governments ultimately
[2:40:57.760 --> 2:41:03.280]  don't value you as an individual you know this is this is getting rid of the deadwood that aren't
[2:41:03.280 --> 2:41:10.000]  too old or infirm or or something wrong with them it's bill gates saying kill the old lady
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:16.240]  and hire 10 people that's exactly right that's exactly what we're doing and i actually i have to
[2:41:16.240 --> 2:41:20.560]  say in 2009 and when i was president of the association american physicians and surgeons
[2:41:20.560 --> 2:41:26.400]  i gave a talk about this and it was about the lessons of carl brant still on the video somewhere
[2:41:26.400 --> 2:41:34.160]  and um on youtube but amazingly but um you know the reason that they did it is they had a philosophy
[2:41:34.160 --> 2:41:40.560]  and the philosophy was that the state the organization trumped your individual rights
[2:41:40.560 --> 2:41:47.520]  that's what all of this is about all of this is is abrogating our individual rights for a world
[2:41:47.520 --> 2:41:52.800]  in which there's there's technocracy it's so organized and and worked out and don't worry
[2:41:52.800 --> 2:41:57.520]  that we won't have all that messy electoral process problem that's what this is about it's it
[2:41:57.520 --> 2:42:04.160]  will will probably have the the appearance now the issue really is how how we get out of this and the
[2:42:04.160 --> 2:42:11.920]  first thing i want to say is the the people running this show you know in 2011 there was a guy named
[2:42:11.920 --> 2:42:17.040]  i think glad felter in switzerland and he did a he did a study and he showed that of all the
[2:42:17.040 --> 2:42:23.040]  corporations millions 37 some million corporations in the world they really boiled down to be 147
[2:42:23.040 --> 2:42:27.760]  companies you know we hear about black rock state street and vanguard of the big three but they're
[2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:32.640]  147 companies and then people on wall street looked at that and said actually they're run by
[2:42:32.640 --> 2:42:37.440]  you know 10 big funds and then somebody else on wall street said well if you know that then you
[2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:43.280]  know that those funds are actually in the control of about 150 men around the world so it's right
[2:42:43.280 --> 2:42:48.320]  out of john colman's book on the committee of 300 where he claimed the 300 men ruled the world
[2:42:48.320 --> 2:42:53.200]  global corporate dictatorship not really married let's talk about solutions straight ahead we'll be back

[2:47:14.000 --> 2:47:39.040]  mary is our guest now she's talking about solutions this biomedical mad scientist takeover
[2:47:39.040 --> 2:47:45.680]  dr mary please continue well i think solutions devolve into what we can do as individuals
[2:47:45.680 --> 2:47:50.640]  and what we can do as a community so as individuals the first thing you have to realize is don't be
[2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:56.960]  afraid because they love it and it's counterproductive to your survival it doesn't help you um knowledge
[2:47:56.960 --> 2:48:01.680]  is the antidote to fear you you need to learn things and they're the world now is has been
[2:48:01.680 --> 2:48:06.400]  divided into time of two groups and that's the group that sit back passively and let the news
[2:48:06.400 --> 2:48:11.200]  tell you things that's just listening to the intelligence services don't do it you have to
[2:48:11.200 --> 2:48:16.240]  actively go out and seek out the truth and question everything and when i've for me question
[2:48:16.240 --> 2:48:20.960]  everything means go down to the basic science so you know as deep as you can dive to feel out
[2:48:20.960 --> 2:48:26.880]  how did they actually prove something to be true um so you gotta have knowledge the the other thing
[2:48:26.880 --> 2:48:31.600]  is you need to be healthy to be a warrior in this we want to save the world for our children at least
[2:48:31.600 --> 2:48:37.120]  i do and i think most of you do so just to be i i think there are five or six things i always say
[2:48:37.120 --> 2:48:41.600]  about being healthy the first thing is don't poison yourself it's unbelievable the number of
[2:48:41.600 --> 2:48:47.040]  poisons we take in um but some of them are almost unavoidable like the city floridate your water but
[2:48:47.040 --> 2:48:53.040]  we have solutions for that too but don't don't purposely taking things like you know wheat
[2:48:53.040 --> 2:48:58.000]  products that that are doused with glyphosate i mean there's just so many things you have to
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:02.720]  you have to look at that so don't poison yourself and then you need essential nutrients you need
[2:49:02.720 --> 2:49:07.520]  about 90 essential nutrients that you can't get except eating it and our soils are depleted so
[2:49:07.520 --> 2:49:11.360]  alex you've got that you know you've been on this this you are the tip of the spear on this
[2:49:11.360 --> 2:49:16.240]  you've been doing this for years i mean they they're gonna lie to you the government lies to
[2:49:16.240 --> 2:49:21.120]  you and says oh those those supplements that just makes expensive urine no that's what set us up
[2:49:21.120 --> 2:49:26.000]  for this don't don't believe them uh research it yourself you need to supplement there's certain
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:32.800]  things that you need parasites parasites are a big lie i've got a parasite protocol on my on
[2:49:32.800 --> 2:49:37.760]  my website it you know i i learned some of this from brian artist but also just think about it
[2:49:37.760 --> 2:49:42.080]  there are there are five or six things they really really don't want us to have in terms of drugs
[2:49:42.080 --> 2:49:47.440]  and they are all anti-parasitic drugs chloroquine hydroxychloroquine nitrozoxanide
[2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:55.440]  what am i blanking on ivermectin and then chlorine dioxide they really don't want
[2:49:55.440 --> 2:50:00.720]  you to have that chlorine dioxide is a universal anti-toxin and it helps with the fluorine problem
[2:50:00.720 --> 2:50:05.760]  it helps with lots of things i would i would you know people go to jail just for mentioning it i'll
[2:50:05.760 --> 2:50:11.440]  mention it and say this is for educational purposes only this isn't this is not approved by the FDA i
[2:50:11.440 --> 2:50:16.720]  just happen to use it um so you have to take care of yourself now the other thing is don't
[2:50:17.280 --> 2:50:22.560]  abet the enemy don't work for these guys you know eichmann didn't kill all the people in the death
[2:50:22.560 --> 2:50:28.960]  camps little people like we did it we got together and we didn't stand up and we didn't quit you know
[2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:34.480]  if you're a nurse or you're a pharmacy tech and you're still injecting these toxins into children
[2:50:34.480 --> 2:50:39.760]  stop doing it because it won't be forgotten you know the the thing we have to remember is
[2:50:39.760 --> 2:50:44.960]  the 150 guys on the top of this pyramid they move money they move around a lot of words
[2:50:44.960 --> 2:50:50.480]  but they don't do the physical reality of working the world of creating the wealth of doing all the
[2:50:50.480 --> 2:50:54.720]  things we do they're just keeping us separated from each other and fighting each other so we
[2:50:54.720 --> 2:51:00.560]  don't realize that we have to start realizing that so i think you know i think that's uh that's
[2:51:00.560 --> 2:51:05.840]  that's a big way to go now the other thing is don't let them distract you with viruses when we need
[2:51:05.840 --> 2:51:11.680]  to be starting to look at at wavelengths i'm i'm serious during this outbreak early on i realized
[2:51:11.680 --> 2:51:16.160]  there was the the fix was in there was something wrong here even though i still you know was kind
[2:51:16.160 --> 2:51:21.280]  of going down that viral paradigm i noticed that the guys in hypha had taken out the wi-fi from their
[2:51:21.280 --> 2:51:26.560]  kids schools hmm they thought it was dangerous and there's a lot don't let them tell you there's no
[2:51:26.560 --> 2:51:31.920]  evidence for this there's lots of research you can find online there's a ton of it uh arthur
[2:51:31.920 --> 2:51:38.880]  fursenberg um just has a download that you can do i mean there's just a lot of stuff uh that show
[2:51:38.880 --> 2:51:44.560]  you the damage of of all sorts of wavelengths i just did a um a deep dive on the pandemic of
[2:51:44.560 --> 2:51:51.360]  1918 and really that started with the telegram lines telegraph lines that the guys moved down
[2:51:51.360 --> 2:51:55.680]  from the farms in tennessee and they were suddenly surrounded by all this copper wire
[2:51:55.680 --> 2:52:01.840]  and this telegraph it sounds a little crazy but it really is true because to in fact the
[2:52:01.840 --> 2:52:07.840]  earlier um as you put up a video and it showed the part of the electron transport chain how do
[2:52:07.840 --> 2:52:13.440]  you metabolize your food you take the food in it goes to your mitochondria and it it has an
[2:52:13.440 --> 2:52:19.440]  electron transport chain and that transport chain gets messed up when you suddenly change into a
[2:52:19.440 --> 2:52:24.720]  higher electromagnetic field and that's what happened that's one of the reasons all the studies show
[2:52:24.720 --> 2:52:30.800]  once new electromagnetic systems go in we get sick we adapt to it quickly but but that's when we
[2:52:30.800 --> 2:52:35.520]  all these studies show it's happening right and we don't always completely adapt to it
[2:52:35.520 --> 2:52:40.720]  so i can't remember if it wasn't a paul or shrillank i'm just having a brain blackout on the country
[2:52:40.720 --> 2:52:47.520]  but i just read about this and basically the country had been you know rural uh not electrified
[2:52:47.520 --> 2:52:52.160]  for its entire existence and i think in the 1990s about the time we were putting in cell phones the
[2:52:52.160 --> 2:52:57.680]  country the government decided to electrify the country that country developed the highest rate
[2:52:57.680 --> 2:53:03.680]  of diabetes you know change the the the rate of change of diabetes in that country was number one
[2:53:03.680 --> 2:53:10.000]  in the world now again you will adapt to some degree but every time we've made a jump up we've
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:14.480]  become a little more sick i mean there's a real issue here so the one thing you can do personally
[2:53:14.480 --> 2:53:20.240]  is you know hardwire your house put your cell phone at least one arm lengths away i i measured
[2:53:20.240 --> 2:53:25.440]  this on myself when you put it one arm lengths away it's not it's not it registers pretty much
[2:53:25.440 --> 2:53:31.760]  almost zero i don't know it's the length of the transmitting antenna it it becomes half as weak
[2:53:31.760 --> 2:53:38.400]  each length away right right so yeah it's the inverse square law so all radiation goes down
[2:53:38.400 --> 2:53:42.560]  for every two times you probably double of the distance it goes down the square so it goes down
[2:53:42.560 --> 2:53:50.560]  four times so you you need to do that and and that's why it does make sense to wear to use wearables
[2:53:50.560 --> 2:53:58.080]  to have things in your area that mitigate um the wi-fi's in in in ionizing radiation like we're
[2:53:58.080 --> 2:54:02.640]  talking about x-rays you have to block it i spent well let's go back to start a world war two they
[2:54:02.640 --> 2:54:07.360]  started heating up cans of beans at the end of world war two in england they noticed people that
[2:54:07.360 --> 2:54:11.600]  worked around renter states we're getting cancer that's in mainline history books so these are
[2:54:11.600 --> 2:54:16.560]  broadcasting systems just as we don't see them doesn't mean it's not shooting through our dna
[2:54:16.560 --> 2:54:23.280]  shooting through the the neurons of our body blasting through uh the molecules that make us up
[2:54:24.720 --> 2:54:30.000]  oh yeah and that and that's the point about about treating things with wavelength too the good news
[2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:35.600]  is this this opens up the possibility for restoring health using this technology now
[2:54:35.600 --> 2:54:39.760]  you know i think we're way behind on that but nonetheless i i'm not giving up hope on that
[2:54:39.760 --> 2:54:44.800]  i hope that that is what the med bed's about people ask how are the globalists doing all this
[2:54:44.800 --> 2:54:48.640]  and protect themselves well they've got they've got the cures they've got the treatments
[2:54:49.920 --> 2:54:54.240]  yeah yeah they know you know i'll bet you bill gates doesn't live in a wi-fi environment
[2:54:54.240 --> 2:55:02.000]  i'll bet you he doesn't you know that's just for us so we're we're being constantly toxified and
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:06.560]  it's going to get worse i think they're going to start dosing us with graphene now that there are
[2:55:06.560 --> 2:55:14.000]  some things you can do like i i like um bob greska i met years ago bob greska is a real nanochemist
[2:55:14.640 --> 2:55:22.400]  and he developed carbon 60 which is a buckyball it's like it's like 60 carbon atom uh carbon
[2:55:22.400 --> 2:55:28.160]  solution in solution and it's an electron donor one of the reasons i think that we're getting the
[2:55:28.160 --> 2:55:33.280]  the final common pathway with this rule formation when your red blood cells kind of stand up and
[2:55:33.280 --> 2:55:38.000]  and all clump together and that's what can start these clots and i'm not saying it's the only thing
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:44.480]  but it can start it is that these these vaccines have um cations in them yeah there's the there's
[2:55:44.480 --> 2:55:51.440]  the carbon 60 this is the antidote but but these cations um they they strip the electrons from the
[2:55:51.440 --> 2:55:55.520]  laminar flow system of your capillaries and so everything starts clumping together what you
[2:55:55.520 --> 2:56:00.320]  need to do is restore the electrons you need an electron donor and so uh there's certain things
[2:56:00.320 --> 2:56:06.880]  that do that i i mean i think carbon 60 makes a lot of sense i also think chlorine dioxide
[2:56:06.880 --> 2:56:13.440]  makes a lot of sense um and and un-wifiing your house i think we have to do that i think you have
[2:56:13.440 --> 2:56:18.240]  to get get away from as much wi-fi as possible you're going to have some but it's dose related
[2:56:18.240 --> 2:56:22.960]  so even if you just turn it off at night time the good news about the 5g is it doesn't travel that
[2:56:22.960 --> 2:56:30.000]  far the bad news is they're going to improve everything so um so i was already rolling out 6g
[2:56:31.760 --> 2:56:38.480]  yeah and keep in mind um g is generation so i don't know what 6g is because 5g is anything
[2:56:38.480 --> 2:56:43.680]  over a gigahertz everything else before our cell phones before we're always below one gigahertz
[2:56:43.680 --> 2:56:47.920]  and now we're we're one gigahertz up to whatever they want to do so i don't know what they mean by
[2:56:47.920 --> 2:56:54.080]  that but i do know and and this was just reported and i think it was karen kingston it was somebody
[2:56:54.080 --> 2:57:00.080]  pointed out that looks at patents that i my eyes glaze over but the chinese patent for their vaccine
[2:57:00.080 --> 2:57:08.160]  their covid vaccine admits to having graphing in it so this is not just conspiracy stuff
[2:57:08.160 --> 2:57:14.320]  there's a global a global program they're putting the plug in us the interface dr lee marron incredible

[3:00:12.560 --> 3:00:18.240]  we're taking your calls right now jonathan in ohio thanks for holding her on the air
[3:00:19.200 --> 3:00:23.200]  awesome hi alex um so i think this is super important that i wanted to let your listeners
[3:00:23.200 --> 3:00:28.320]  know so i started my podcast the jonathan kogan show which everyone can go to if they want
[3:00:28.320 --> 3:00:34.640]  anchor dot fm force less j sk for johnson scott kogan because there's an unbelievable phenomenon
[3:00:34.640 --> 3:00:40.560]  that blows my mind everybody knows that core media is lying to them about everything except
[3:00:40.560 --> 3:00:45.920]  for some reason when it comes to alex jones or when it comes to andrew tape all of a sudden
[3:00:45.920 --> 3:00:50.720]  corporate media seems to be telling the truth it's a fascinating and they don't believe anybody
[3:00:50.720 --> 3:00:54.960]  say but then when it's something by alex jones oh we believe it oh he must be horrible and you're
[3:00:54.960 --> 3:01:00.800]  the only person i know that is doing the right thing that is telling the truth that is consistently
[3:01:00.800 --> 3:01:05.360]  right and i've only been listening for since since the government started to step on my toes
[3:01:05.360 --> 3:01:10.400]  and i just want them to stay out of my life and i think most people are apolitical and just
[3:01:10.400 --> 3:01:17.600]  want to live their lives and people won't listen to you because in their deep subconscious they can't
[3:01:17.600 --> 3:01:22.640]  get your name out associated with how bad you've been smeared and so i'm like okay i'm going to
[3:01:22.640 --> 3:01:26.880]  start the jonathan kogan show podcast i'm going to watch info wars and i'm going to disseminate
[3:01:26.880 --> 3:01:31.840]  that information with my voice and maybe those people who aren't willing to listen to you will
[3:01:31.840 --> 3:01:36.960]  listen to me just tell the same information because as you we both are we're both pro-human
[3:01:36.960 --> 3:01:42.080]  we don't care if you're male female tall short black white we want humanity to thrive because
[3:01:42.080 --> 3:01:48.080]  we like human beings and last time i checked we are human beings and like people don't understand
[3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:52.880]  that that's really it i mean they demonize anybody promoting pro-human to scare everybody else to
[3:01:52.880 --> 3:01:59.280]  run away from it and when they run away they get shut down themselves absolutely but it's like
[3:01:59.280 --> 3:02:04.240]  fascinating that they they they go yeah corp meat is lying about everything but then they say alex
[3:02:04.240 --> 3:02:08.640]  jones did this and i'll be a lie and they believe that though or they believe that and you take bad
[3:02:08.640 --> 3:02:13.600]  even though he is not and so i was like okay i'm going to die on this hill protecting your guys
[3:02:13.600 --> 3:02:17.920]  in speech and hopefully getting people the truth and so there's two two things i had to ask which
[3:02:17.920 --> 3:02:24.000]  is one thing i can't figure out that i did on my last episode was are we being attacked by the
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:29.920]  globalist and the ccp or are they on the same team the globalist the ccp ccp or one team
[3:02:29.920 --> 3:02:37.440]  oh they are one team okay and then the one question i get asked the most is okay so if they're
[3:02:37.440 --> 3:02:41.920]  injecting this poison and hurting all these people and you have these these politicians that obviously
[3:02:41.920 --> 3:02:47.040]  won't be in that that that last 300 group with with claus Schwab and his white cat and you know
[3:02:47.040 --> 3:02:52.800]  it's pinky up to his mouth like dr evil um why if they know it's hurting children hurting people
[3:02:52.800 --> 3:02:57.200]  why are they doing it like what's the real reason why the people who are because they want to play
[3:02:57.200 --> 3:03:02.800]  god and they see us as guinea pigs they're testing on and they believe being god is playing god
[3:03:02.800 --> 3:03:06.880]  and deciding who lives and dies i appreciate your call jonathan mike and texas go ahead
[3:03:08.560 --> 3:03:15.280]  alex has been a few years since you and i last spoke so unless trump's response proves me wrong
[3:03:16.000 --> 3:03:23.200]  it is my contention that trump cannot admit that the shots are killing people because that might be
[3:03:23.200 --> 3:03:30.560]  that mission of guilt which could open the doors to criminal and civil liability so that's my contention
[3:03:31.760 --> 3:03:40.080]  also as far as trump goes i think condemning him that that should uh should have said long ago
[3:03:40.080 --> 3:03:46.720]  we've had ample opportunity he unconstitutionally closed down the country he ruined millions of lives
[3:03:46.720 --> 3:03:55.920]  okay he then he then rips out warp speed he strong arms the fda and this this this naive
[3:03:55.920 --> 3:04:02.480]  day and this oh i didn't know anything i'll tell me should we do that is nonsense and it doesn't
[3:04:02.480 --> 3:04:10.720]  fly and ignorance does not fly of law which further if i may expound i feel he's sandwiched
[3:04:10.720 --> 3:04:19.040]  past his own election why to keep the left-right paradigm continuing and so we still have the hero
[3:04:19.040 --> 3:04:24.400]  and we have the villain trump and biden and we still have the savior that is my contention
[3:04:25.280 --> 3:04:29.520]  i appreciate your call i think your prediction is right i will tell you when we come back in one
[3:04:29.520 --> 3:04:36.560]  minute trump's response to us saying please you're not part of this come out against it
[3:04:36.560 --> 3:04:52.480]  we will cover that straight ahead after the 60 second break in full wars dot com tomorrow's news today

[3:06:03.600 --> 3:06:11.200]  to stop tyranny till so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex joe
[3:06:13.680 --> 3:06:20.880]  so about a month ago i said listen if trump doesn't come out against these boys and shots
[3:06:20.880 --> 3:06:26.080]  when all the establishments leave the sinking ship he's backing it i can't support trump
[3:06:26.080 --> 3:06:31.840]  the sanis is coming out he's saying he doesn't trust the shots uh they didn't work can't trump do
[3:06:31.840 --> 3:06:38.400]  that and say fouchy and berks and the rest of them lied to him so that became a big national news
[3:06:38.400 --> 3:06:45.440]  story then i put another report out and i said i don't think trumps pad i think trumps a good person
[3:06:45.440 --> 3:06:52.960]  and he should simply come out against the shots and say he was lied to and the corporate media
[3:06:52.960 --> 3:06:57.840]  spun it that i'd flip flopped and oh i'm for the sanis and now i'm for trump no i said trump i
[3:06:57.840 --> 3:07:01.520]  support you you did so many good things you fought the globalists they hate your guts
[3:07:02.080 --> 3:07:07.760]  they're setting you up they're already leaving the sinking ship you to come out and so trump
[3:07:07.760 --> 3:07:13.840]  tried to call me i missed the call he reached out to one of his supporters one of his advisors
[3:07:13.840 --> 3:07:18.880]  and said why is alex saying this so i shot an emergency message about a week and a half ago
[3:07:18.880 --> 3:07:26.640]  to trump he got it he watched it and then i got the response back and trump told the people that
[3:07:26.640 --> 3:07:32.800]  brought it to him i've talked to him in the meeting and they and trump said i don't want to hear
[3:07:33.680 --> 3:07:39.200]  about questioning this so-called vaccine again i called a so-called vaccine he said i don't want
[3:07:39.200 --> 3:07:50.320]  to hear about this again from anybody i think it's good and that's it so trump last friday
[3:07:51.360 --> 3:07:58.560]  in response to all of this said i believe what i did was good it's an effective vaccine it works
[3:07:58.560 --> 3:08:03.680]  and that's it even though they admit it doesn't work even though they admit it's hurting people
[3:08:03.680 --> 3:08:10.640]  even though they admit it's a fraud he still says 95 effective and that's trump doing that
[3:08:10.640 --> 3:08:20.080]  that's not me so i gave trump until the 23rd of september to not an ultimatum but just a
[3:08:20.080 --> 3:08:25.120]  point of time to say you're not part of this we know the democrats try to make it mandatory
[3:08:25.120 --> 3:08:28.880]  we know the democrats tried to make people take it you're against making the military take your
[3:08:28.880 --> 3:08:33.920]  kids taking it that's a great thing you've done trump you're already way better than them we just
[3:08:33.920 --> 3:08:40.880]  don't want them to blame you now for what they've done and his answer is no i back it that's it
[3:08:42.320 --> 3:08:47.840]  so i'm done talking about trump i'm not attacking trump i'm not supporting trump i'm going to support
[3:08:47.840 --> 3:08:54.720]  people like bolsano and the sanis that are coming out saying the shot doesn't work we were lied to
[3:08:54.720 --> 3:09:02.160]  it's a fraud i'm not against trump i don't hate trump i'm not his enemy but he took a million
[3:09:02.160 --> 3:09:07.200]  bucks from fiser which is not that much to be bought out by that's not why he's doing this
[3:09:08.720 --> 3:09:13.440]  he said he's the vaccine man he said he saved hundreds of millions of people
[3:09:14.720 --> 3:09:22.800]  he led operation warp speed and so he can't admit he was wrong and that is his decision
[3:09:22.800 --> 3:09:25.920]  do i like the fact you're trying to indict him for documents that are his own no
[3:09:26.480 --> 3:09:30.960]  do i like the fact he's come out today and called for a new election saying the election's a fraud
[3:09:30.960 --> 3:09:38.320]  i love that i love trump he's so good on the border and china and technology and the military
[3:09:38.320 --> 3:09:46.720]  i'm not against trump but on the issue of the poison shot he is letting them set him up irrevocably
[3:09:46.720 --> 3:09:55.040]  and when it comes to kids being hurt by shots i will not be part of that equation and i will not
[3:09:55.040 --> 3:10:00.800]  support that and he's been given plenty of time and so i've been clear here that i'm very hurt by
[3:10:00.800 --> 3:10:08.320]  this i'm not out to get trump i'm not trump's enemy but i will support candidates that are
[3:10:08.320 --> 3:10:14.400]  exposing the shot i mean you know tucker carlson came out last week and had the british medical
[3:10:14.400 --> 3:10:23.760]  journal on explaining that nine out of ten dying of coveted had the shot in the uk i mean it doesn't
[3:10:23.760 --> 3:10:34.400]  just not work it's hurting people and trump is pigheadedly staying on that train so i i wasn't
[3:10:34.400 --> 3:10:39.280]  like i'm not trying to get a job with the sanis or a job with trump i'm not a politico i just try
[3:10:39.280 --> 3:10:44.640]  to cover issues as fairly as i can i'm wrong sometimes i write most of the time so for me
[3:10:46.480 --> 3:10:51.440]  i was hoping we could push trump with the evidence he goes against buddha's rallies
[3:10:51.440 --> 3:10:57.360]  when he pushes the poison vaccine the poison shot i was just wanting to get him to go after
[3:10:57.360 --> 3:11:04.560]  dazzic and fouchy and bill gates and berks and the new world order and say i was lied to that's
[3:11:04.560 --> 3:11:10.160]  the obvious move if you've been conned if you've been lied to he supported monoclonial antibodies
[3:11:10.160 --> 3:11:14.800]  that people criticize turned out to work great with no side effects that's a great thing trump did
[3:11:14.800 --> 3:11:19.680]  i get he like unlocked things i want to get it going i want to fix things i'm all there
[3:11:21.920 --> 3:11:28.960]  but now i've done my job i've told the truth and i've exposed what's going on and we've gone over
[3:11:28.960 --> 3:11:36.400]  the evidence and now i'm done i'm done it doesn't mean i support joe biden coming up in two years
[3:11:36.400 --> 3:11:40.240]  i want republicans to get elected because they're the better party and try to fix things
[3:11:40.240 --> 3:11:46.880]  in 90 in 71 days and i can see where all this is going and they're coming after trump which
[3:11:46.880 --> 3:11:51.760]  makes me want to back trump and i will back him above the deep state and their attempts to take
[3:11:51.760 --> 3:11:59.200]  him down and the russia gate lies and the secret document lies and all of that is real
[3:12:02.480 --> 3:12:07.840]  but if your wife or your husband takes care of your sons and daughters
[3:12:11.200 --> 3:12:18.000]  364 days a year but on one day of the year kills your kids you still don't like that
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:22.880]  husband or wife and that's what this is is a political marriage and it's just a no it's a
[3:12:22.880 --> 3:12:28.080]  no-brainer i mean it's the turd the punchbowl trump's great most of the time he has this big
[3:12:28.080 --> 3:12:33.040]  bowl of punch of freedom and justice and all these good things and he craps to the punchbowl
[3:12:33.040 --> 3:12:39.360]  i cannot support that i can't metaphysically fight the new world order and risk my life
[3:12:39.360 --> 3:12:44.240]  and be attacked and be demonized and go through hell and then have trump sit there and
[3:12:44.240 --> 3:12:52.160]  and be pickheaded because he got tricked into this so now he's not the point of being tricked by it
[3:12:55.680 --> 3:13:00.080]  because it's all out in the open it's all coming out it doesn't work makes you sick and hurt you
[3:13:00.080 --> 3:13:07.920]  now he is deciding to be part of this he's deciding to become metaphysically bill gates
[3:13:08.480 --> 3:13:13.200]  he's deciding to become peter dazik he's deciding to become athlete found she
[3:13:13.200 --> 3:13:22.000]  he's decided to come berks and will inskey and so he is deciding to separate himself from us
[3:13:22.640 --> 3:13:32.640]  and to be that and when he does that that's his choice we are now at least for me separated from
[3:13:32.640 --> 3:13:39.920]  him doesn't mean i won't stand up against the persecution against trump doesn't mean i don't
[3:13:39.920 --> 3:13:49.120]  love the great things he did it just means dead kids and maimed children and shots that are a
[3:13:49.120 --> 3:13:55.600]  shirmean system and cause heart attacks and infertility i will not be part of that so it's
[3:13:55.600 --> 3:14:03.520]  very very simple of where we stand here on the year from spending given a chance he's been given a
[3:14:03.520 --> 3:14:12.320]  year and eight nine months to make his proper decision and he's not done it now maybe he'll
[3:14:12.320 --> 3:14:18.480]  change course but trump his strength was he never changed his course but it's also his weakness
[3:14:18.480 --> 3:14:27.360]  it's a paradox and so i support trump calling for a new election i support him exposing china
[3:14:27.360 --> 3:14:34.720]  i support him trying to control the border i love it all except the poison shocks and i know my
[3:14:34.720 --> 3:14:42.400]  listeners are already there i just had to try to give trump a major chance and maybe with my
[3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:47.680]  ultimatum not a power trip but everybody knows we all get trump elected everybody knows you've
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:58.800]  helped push him over the top he's got till the 23rd friday the 23rd to say hey i was lied to
[3:14:59.440 --> 3:15:06.000]  hey this is a lie i'm not part of it he has that long to decouple himself and then i'm not going
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:09.920]  to make a big deal about it we've already made the big deal about it we've already made the
[3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:14.720]  decision we've already done what we're going to do here it's just that the globalists are getting
[3:15:14.720 --> 3:15:19.760]  ready to stage terror attacks and claim that we're staging them because we're mad he's going to be
[3:15:19.760 --> 3:15:24.560]  indicted i'm not backing away from trump because he's about to be indicted i would love to support
[3:15:24.560 --> 3:15:30.240]  him during this time but because he's not doing the right thing on the vaccines and going after

[3:24:02.320 --> 3:24:08.960]  that's what we called it when it began and we called it that when it began because all these
[3:24:08.960 --> 3:24:20.640]  little lowlife pieces of scum crap arrogant arrogant arrogant little boys and girls
[3:24:21.360 --> 3:24:22.480]  from the white house
[3:24:25.120 --> 3:24:34.400]  all across the world we're fighting a war we're fighting a war that's right wrote about it in
[3:24:34.400 --> 3:24:41.840]  detail in the trends journal as it happened by the way there is no magazine in the world
[3:24:42.720 --> 3:24:55.280]  that covered this covet war better than we did on january 28th remember the covet war begins
[3:24:55.280 --> 3:25:07.440]  in china in 2020 on chinese lunar new year the year of the rat the cover of the trends journal
[3:25:07.440 --> 3:25:20.400]  was coronavirus 106 dead in china and our next line was 1.4 billion still alive what are you
[3:25:20.400 --> 3:25:28.400]  telling me 106 people died and again we did it in detail they couldn't stop the protests in
[3:25:28.400 --> 3:25:35.680]  hong kong i used to be on hong kong tv 20 minutes a show you know every couple of weeks and they
[3:25:35.680 --> 3:25:41.040]  weren't going to stop fighting 7.5 million people and over a million taking to the streets and
[3:25:41.040 --> 3:25:48.640]  protests of china taken over you can't get a million people at a 332 million in america that
[3:25:48.640 --> 3:25:54.720]  that ended it when they locked it down we've been following the covet war since the beginning
[3:25:55.760 --> 3:26:06.560]  the damage it has done mentally spiritually physically and economically is incalculable
[3:26:06.560 --> 3:26:11.840]  and unprecedented it has destroyed the lives and livelihoods
[3:26:11.840 --> 3:26:24.320]  of billions of people it'll come back no it's not coming back so going back to it we covered this
[3:26:24.320 --> 3:26:32.720]  it's a war and why am i mentioning it because it's very easy to take the people to war
[3:26:32.720 --> 3:26:41.280]  war this is from herman goreng he was hitler's field marshal et aluf wafa
[3:26:44.720 --> 3:26:51.440]  and this is he's waiting to be tried in the norenberg trials and this is a
[3:26:54.240 --> 3:26:55.200]  from his statement
[3:26:55.200 --> 3:27:07.440]  and the rank and file file are usually much more primitive than we imagine propaganda must
[3:27:07.440 --> 3:27:14.160]  therefore always be essentially simple or repetitious oh no that's gerbils
[3:27:14.160 --> 3:27:25.840]  all right here it is why of course the people don't want war why shouldn't some poor slob on
[3:27:25.840 --> 3:27:32.800]  a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best he can get out of it is to come back to his
[3:27:32.800 --> 3:27:41.520]  farm in one piece naturally the common people don't want war neither in russia nor in england
[3:27:41.520 --> 3:27:52.160]  nor for that matter in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who
[3:27:52.160 --> 3:28:01.360]  determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a
[3:28:01.360 --> 3:28:11.360]  democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice
[3:28:11.360 --> 3:28:17.920]  to no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of their leaders that is easy
[3:28:18.720 --> 3:28:25.840]  all you have to do is tell them they're being attacked and denounce the peacemakers for lack
[3:28:25.840 --> 3:28:33.360]  of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same way in any country
[3:28:34.240 --> 3:28:39.920]  that's right attack the peacemakers like i'm attacked up here for having peace and freedom
[3:28:39.920 --> 3:28:46.960]  around us attack the freedom people who don't want you to be forced with an injection the
[3:28:46.960 --> 3:28:58.320]  covid war they let us to war and the masses follow the best product i'm not i'm not supposed to be
[3:28:58.320 --> 3:29:02.320]  biased but i'm gonna tell you all now if you haven't tried turbo force you need to try it i've tried

[3:33:18.320 --> 3:33:25.600]  you're listening to the alex jones show and now your host gerald solente
[3:33:25.600 --> 3:33:33.040]  hey great to be an alex jones show remember do what you can to support info loads
[3:33:33.760 --> 3:33:40.320]  we're doing the best they can to give you information that you need that the prestitute media isn't
[3:33:40.320 --> 3:33:48.080]  isn't that won't put out there again as i just read that quote from herman goring hitlers field
[3:33:48.080 --> 3:33:56.240]  marshal another one from joseph gerbils this is the prime minister of the rites minister of propaganda
[3:33:56.240 --> 3:34:02.480]  during world war two if you tell a big lie enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come
[3:34:02.480 --> 3:34:15.440]  to believe it think of the press as a great keyboard on which the government can play got it and
[3:34:15.440 --> 3:34:20.720]  that's why if you look up the word prestitute wikipedia i'm the guy that came up with it
[3:34:21.760 --> 3:34:26.720]  i used to be on opera the today show good morning america all of the shows fox and friends they're
[3:34:26.720 --> 3:34:32.720]  not like they don't want me anymore not a friend i used to be on with katie corrick and matt lower
[3:34:33.680 --> 3:34:39.600]  all of them all of them when i said what would happen with the afghan war they hated me for that
[3:34:39.600 --> 3:34:47.520]  then i said what happened with the iraq war that was it the media their prostitutes their
[3:34:47.520 --> 3:34:55.840]  media whores they get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and their government whore masters
[3:34:57.280 --> 3:35:01.520]  i just use different language than gerbils to describe them
[3:35:01.520 --> 3:35:12.160]  and again the rank and file are usually much more primitive than we imagine
[3:35:13.440 --> 3:35:19.040]  hey man did you see that game yesterday man i thought the yankees would have won you know they
[3:35:19.040 --> 3:35:23.520]  had to take out the pitch and they then why didn't they take them out in the fifth inning how come
[3:35:23.520 --> 3:35:30.960]  they didn't that's the people now they know who's on first who what teams on first well who's what
[3:35:30.960 --> 3:35:37.840]  teams last how many teams they're back they know every detail primitive to the facts of life

[3:49:58.320 --> 3:50:07.120]  herman goreng and he was he was being recorded by this guy gilbert and when
[3:50:11.280 --> 3:50:18.480]  goreng said why of course the people don't want war he said naturally the common people
[3:50:18.480 --> 3:50:24.320]  don't want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor that matter germany that is
[3:50:24.320 --> 3:50:29.680]  understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy
[3:50:30.320 --> 3:50:37.360]  and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy
[3:50:37.360 --> 3:50:44.640]  or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship now sky gilbert
[3:50:44.640 --> 3:50:53.600]  interjects there's one difference he said in a democracy the people have some say
[3:50:54.400 --> 3:51:00.080]  in the matters through their elected representatives and in the united states
[3:51:01.120 --> 3:51:11.360]  only congress can declare wars oh yeah they didn't declare the afghan war didn't declare the liby
[3:51:11.360 --> 3:51:16.800]  award didn't declare the siri award didn't declare the iraq war didn't declare the vietnam
[3:51:16.800 --> 3:51:23.920]  war didn't declare the korean war the dictators and charged it that imbeciles and morons call
[3:51:23.920 --> 3:51:33.040]  their president all right only congress has the right to declare war and we got these little boys
[3:51:33.040 --> 3:51:40.160]  and girls now telling us what to do so just to note that i want to go on to the economy i got a lot
