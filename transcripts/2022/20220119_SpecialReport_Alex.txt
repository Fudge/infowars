[00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:11.212]  Dozens of major world airline carriers have stopped flights to the United States over one big thing, 5G, and the fact that it totally jams all their communications.
[00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:23.238]  Lufthansa became one of at least nine airlines cancelling flights or changing jets over fears the 5G network could interfere with the plane's technology.
[00:00:23.338 --> 00:00:32.085]  They're warning that sensitive flight instruments like autopilot and terrain warning may be compromised in low visibility conditions which we've seen in the Northeast this week.
[00:00:31.904 --> 00:00:38.743]   week, including the possibility of catastrophic failures leading to multiple fatalities in
[00:00:38.743 --> 00:00:53.144]  the absence of appropriate mitigations.
[00:00:54.078 --> 00:00:59.303]  But 5G is extremely powerful, way more powerful than previous generations.
[00:00:59.803 --> 00:01:00.864]  It doesn't go as far.
[00:01:01.547 --> 00:01:07.891]  But in the proximity where it works, it is incredibly powerful and penetrates everything.
[00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:13.495]  Now we can't see it because our eyes only pick up a very small part of the energy spectrum.
[00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:21.120]  But if you could see it, it is like a giant blasting sun of microwave radiation.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.804]  Your cell phones, of course, interface with it using their own microwave system.
[00:01:26.864 --> 00:01:27.825]  They are transceivers.
[00:01:27.865 --> 00:01:29.626]  They receive and transmit.
[00:01:29.726 --> 00:01:33.149]   So everybody is freaking out now.
[00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:39.291]  Not about the Wired Magazine articles many years ago confirming 5G causes cancer and linking to the actual studies.
[00:01:39.872 --> 00:01:40.892]  Not all the real research.
[00:01:41.252 --> 00:01:42.713]  Oh no, that's just research papers.
[00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:44.594]  But when the public hears... Wait a minute.
[00:01:45.595 --> 00:01:48.738]  Foreign airlines are grounding traffic to major U.S.
[00:01:48.778 --> 00:01:50.960]  cities where 5G was about to be turned on.
[00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:52.381]  What the hell's going on?
[00:01:52.922 --> 00:02:04.132]  Well, it's because they already know in other parts of the world where 5G has gone in, it wreaks total havoc on the instrumentation of the aircraft again, because it's so incredibly powerful.
[00:02:04.553 --> 00:02:08.336]  It blocks and jams many of their systems like altimeters.
[00:02:09.357 --> 00:02:10.118]  Now think about that.
[00:02:10.967 --> 00:02:33.423]  Whether you think cancer is a good thing, whether you think the world's overpopulated and you believe it's a good thing, it's going to kill everybody, or maybe you think it's good for you and it's wonderful and has no health effects, despite all the facts, why would the establishment worldwide roll this out and not go out and research and check that it jams all sorts of other communications?
[00:02:35.925 --> 00:02:40.588]  Blinds the different instruments in the cockpit of aircraft?
[00:02:41.323 --> 00:02:48.753]  Why wouldn't the corporate system go out and do studies or look at what the effects of this would be once they turn it on?
[00:02:50.094 --> 00:02:58.338]  Well the answer is they just don't care because they want autonomous cars and autonomous robots on the streets and that's what 5G is for overall.
[00:02:59.058 --> 00:03:08.482]  Because you can't have latent systems that have a big space of time or have to buffer when it's a robot car or a robot truck or a robot drone or robot aircraft.
[00:03:08.802 --> 00:03:12.404]  You've got to have continual connection to that.
[00:03:12.924 --> 00:03:15.105]  And that's why they want 5G in place.
[00:03:16.124 --> 00:03:18.666]  And the political system doesn't care about the health risks.
[00:03:18.686 --> 00:03:23.610]  They don't care about the facts that this stuff is worse statistically than smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for 40 years.
[00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.275]  They care about having this control system in so they can roll out the new robot economy that Klaus Schwab talks about so much.
[00:03:31.896 --> 00:03:41.183]  But there is a major historical parallel to what we've seen with 5G rollout and all the evidence and all the facts and all the dangers being ignored by the establishment.
[00:03:41.912 --> 00:03:49.557]  And that's the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion that happened more than a decade ago on April 20, 2010.
[00:03:50.818 --> 00:03:52.800]  And what happened then?
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.261]  It's on record.
[00:03:54.281 --> 00:04:06.469]  In fact, if you've seen a movie with Kurt Russell and with others, it's extremely accurate because they used the lawsuit court proceedings and witness files to basically write the script.
[00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:32.331]   And I've gone and read much of the file and much of the testimony from Deepwater Horizon And there were bankers back in London who ordered the bankers in Houston to order the engineers on at that time the deepest well ever drilled in world history to not dump what they call mud in on top of the drill as it went deeper.
[00:04:33.817 --> 00:04:35.057]  Now, mud is really just concrete.
[00:04:35.738 --> 00:04:50.283]  That's why on a big rig like that, while it's drilling, you'll see ships just lined up for miles and miles, big tankers, and they've got concrete being mixed inside of them that has been pumped into the well and pumped down the hole, and it was costing them more than $25 million a day in mud.
[00:04:51.543 --> 00:05:03.041]   And so the executives looked at that, this is all on record, they have the emails, they have the text messages, they have the testimony, and off in London, they ordered Houston to order the rig, to not dump mud.
[00:05:03.081 --> 00:05:05.842]  They said, you know, dump seawater into the hole.
[00:05:07.363 --> 00:05:12.384]  And the engineers went, whoa, that'll cause it to mix with the gas and oil and cause a blowout, guaranteed.
[00:05:13.365 --> 00:05:21.727]  And because there's not enough pressure in it, at first the water pressure will keep it down, but it'll only build, and once it explodes, it'll probably kill everybody on the rig and cause the biggest oil spill in history.
[00:05:22.808 --> 00:05:26.229]  And on record, the execs ordered them to do it.
[00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.049]   And so, the engineers didn't want to lose their jobs, They should have just said, I'm not doing it.
[00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.593]  And they said, okay, we want the head executive in the U.S.
[00:05:35.633 --> 00:05:36.374]  here on the ship.
[00:05:36.895 --> 00:05:40.899]  So he got on a jet, and they got on a helicopter, flew out there, and they did the test.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.822]  And they stopped dumping the concrete in.
[00:05:44.926 --> 00:05:46.026]  And at first, it didn't blow up.
[00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:47.267]  And he said, see?
[00:05:47.387 --> 00:05:48.087]  Told you, bye!
[00:05:48.407 --> 00:05:52.749]  Flew off, and a few hours later, in the middle of the night, it blew sky high.
[00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:54.369]  And the rest is history.
[00:05:54.829 --> 00:06:04.973]  And that's a perfect example of 5G, or these mRNA vaccines, or all of these corporate revolutions, where these corporate heads don't feel like they're ever going to be held accountable.
[00:06:05.253 --> 00:06:08.314]  Okay, they cause $100 billion in damages, they pay a $2 billion fine.
[00:06:08.874 --> 00:06:12.876]  Or they put out a deadly vaccine that causes a bunch of death, they'll just have the regulators they own cover it up.
[00:06:13.854 --> 00:06:15.635]  And that's what we've seen with the vaccine rollout.
[00:06:16.055 --> 00:06:17.637]  That's what we've seen with the Deepwater Horizon.
[00:06:17.837 --> 00:06:19.558]  And that's what we've seen with 5G.
[00:06:19.678 --> 00:06:20.498]  And it's just crazy.
[00:06:21.299 --> 00:06:27.543]  Plato, more than 2,300 years ago, wrote about a lot of things that archaeologists have since found to be true.
[00:06:27.563 --> 00:06:30.725]  In fact, everything they've discovered is just proving what he said.
[00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.807]  But there's large parts of what he said that we can't prove.
[00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:53.017]   He claimed that out in the Atlantic Ocean, there was this big island that had Ships that flew in the air, had a big energy source that fired a light into the air, and then out of that energy source, all the machines, including what he described as basically big, tall Autobot-type Transformers walking around that humans controlled.
[00:06:53.197 --> 00:07:00.423]  And he said 2,000 plus years ago this was happening, and that the energy source got unstable because they wanted too much power from it, and it blew up.
[00:07:01.804 --> 00:07:03.605]  Now, I don't know if Atlantis really existed.
[00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:11.557]  But we've built Atlantis-type technology now, and we've got a bunch of corporate chiefs and people that feel totally disconnected from reality.
[00:07:11.877 --> 00:07:13.499]  They're creating animal-human clones.
[00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:16.041]  They are releasing GMO all over the planet.
[00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.102]  They're releasing smart dust.
[00:07:17.342 --> 00:07:18.843]  They created COVID-19 in Wuhan.
[00:07:18.863 --> 00:07:19.704]  That's in all the documents.
[00:07:20.524 --> 00:07:27.371]   And the public is living here in this super-scientific advanced civilization, but we're losing Our ability to read and write.
[00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:31.233]  We're losing our ability to even understand history, or even care, or even worry about ourselves.
[00:07:32.073 --> 00:07:33.534]  We are like the Atlanteans.
[00:07:34.355 --> 00:07:35.976]  We are the Atlanteans here today.
[00:07:35.996 --> 00:07:38.097]  Whether they exist or not, we are Atlantis.
[00:07:39.498 --> 00:07:43.880]  Come true today, and we're reaching that Atlantean moment when we destroy ourselves.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.443]  So, ladies and gentlemen, the globalists know 5G gives you cancer.
[00:07:48.988 --> 00:07:53.991]  The globalists absolutely know these vaccines don't protect you and cause cancer and heart attacks and blood clots.
[00:07:54.572 --> 00:07:55.552]  And they're just going ahead with it.
[00:07:56.273 --> 00:07:59.875]  Because they want to have the organized, controlled collapse of society.
[00:08:00.756 --> 00:08:02.437]  They want to get rid of the general public.
[00:08:02.737 --> 00:08:04.518]  And that's why they're so reckless and so crazy.
[00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:14.965]  But it's clear from their activities that wanting depopulation, wanting to build a dystopia, is really because they don't have the mind or the skills to hold humanity up and actually build a future we don't show ourselves.
[00:08:15.366 --> 00:08:18.868]  So they've just rationalized that they're having a controlled demolition of the economy.
[00:08:19.288 --> 00:08:21.710]  through globalism because that's a better plan.
[00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:24.173]  And the truth is they're scared and don't know what to do.
[00:08:25.314 --> 00:08:38.265]  There's also a healthy mix of powerful corporate executives who again think they know better than engineers about simple mathematics of the fact that a deepwater well is going to blow up when it hits major gas and oil reserves.
[00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:52.076]   So this is a cautionary parable That's real life for everybody to wake up and look around us and realize that everything these big corporations roll out is not always a good idea.
[00:08:52.396 --> 00:08:54.238]  And generally, it's a very bad idea.
[00:08:54.698 --> 00:09:00.604]  And they're like mad scientists that actually don't know what they're doing, but are just playing around with the very laws of nature and physics.
[00:09:01.465 --> 00:09:01.705]  All right.
[00:09:01.745 --> 00:09:03.046]  Thank you for joining us here today.
[00:09:03.407 --> 00:09:03.947]  We'll continue.
[00:09:03.967 --> 00:09:04.868]  We'll come back after the break.
[00:09:05.268 --> 00:09:06.469]  InfoWars.com.
[00:09:06.549 --> 00:09:07.909]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:09:07.909 --> 00:09:14.250]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.509]  A riotous mob.
[00:09:15.565 --> 00:09:22.211]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.
[00:09:22.512 --> 00:09:25.775]  We will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[00:09:25.795 --> 00:09:26.936]  Domestic terrorists.
[00:09:28.925 --> 00:09:31.206]  The days of independent media are numbered.
[00:09:31.506 --> 00:09:33.948]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[00:09:34.628 --> 00:09:37.049]  They are now debanking us behind the scenes.
[00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:40.471]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:45.914]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps.
[00:09:46.434 --> 00:09:48.975]  The traitors know they can shut us down by force.
[00:09:49.716 --> 00:09:52.277]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[00:09:52.937 --> 00:09:53.438]  So be it.
[00:09:54.418 --> 00:09:56.179]  Make them silence us by force.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.281]  This is the final battle of the Information War.

[00:10:08.447 --> 00:10:09.388]  Victory or death.
