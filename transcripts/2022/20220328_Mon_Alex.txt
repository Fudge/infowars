[00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:12.752]  All of what we are seeing play out in Europe right now is an upsetting of the balance of the world order as they want it, as people like Dr. Harari, as people like Klaus Schwab, and others.
[00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:14.052]  Bill Gates is another one.
[00:00:14.532 --> 00:00:26.155]  So we have to understand that these are people that are very smart, they're very well resourced, and they have a very sort of strategic idea of how they want to see the world develop.
[00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:34.519]   And God And a soul are not part of that strategy.
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.060]  That's right, because they're going to be your soul.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.861]  They're going to program you.
[00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:41.523]  So, his crime wasn't agreeing that the New World Order has been upset.
[00:00:41.623 --> 00:00:42.223]  That's a fact.
[00:00:42.504 --> 00:00:44.725]  The headlines are like, preposterous, the New World Order has been upset.
[00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:49.488]  It was pointing out that the people running this New World Order are not Americans and don't like us.
[00:00:50.424 --> 00:00:58.205]  Does that mean Putin's pervert and we should go skip along with him through the, you know, glades and little flowers and play patty cake?
[00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:02.666]  No, it just means Putin isn't the one deploding our borders having drag queen story time.
[00:01:02.926 --> 00:01:04.466]  Putin's not the one shipping fentanyl in here.
[00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.387]  Putin's not the one devaluing our dollar.
[00:01:07.207 --> 00:01:09.347]  Putin's not the one shutting down the Keystone Pipeline.
[00:01:09.887 --> 00:01:11.328]  Putin's not the one trying to take your guns.
[00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:13.408]  No, it's the New World Order.
[00:01:13.428 --> 00:01:13.928]  We'll be right back.
[00:01:14.087 --> 00:01:21.087]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:21.087 --> 00:01:33.007]  It's Monday, March 28, 2022.
[00:01:32.686 --> 00:01:35.686]  on the verge of thermonuclear war.
[00:01:35.686 --> 00:01:38.186]  (crowd cheering)
[00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:40.945]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:49.705]   So in this hour, let the words of Pope John Paul burn as brightly today.
[00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:52.365]  Never, ever give up hope.
[00:01:52.365 --> 00:01:53.365]  Never doubt.
[00:01:53.836 --> 00:01:54.596]  Never tire.
[00:01:55.076 --> 00:01:56.777]  Never become discouraged.
[00:01:57.297 --> 00:01:58.878]  Be not afraid.
[00:01:58.898 --> 00:02:14.086]  A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people's love for liberty.
[00:02:14.898 --> 00:02:18.500]  Brutality will never grind down their will to be free.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.402]  Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia.
[00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:27.324]  For free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness.
[00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:36.188]  We will have a different future, a brighter future, rooted in democracy and principles, hope and light, of decency and dignity, of freedom and possibilities.
[00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:41.031]  For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power.
[00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:51.366]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live, Monday, worldwide broadcast.
[00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:57.311]  You're watching InfoWars, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:59.072 --> 00:03:04.196]  And Lord willing, we'll be here on air for the next four hours.
[00:03:04.256 --> 00:03:15.001]   Well, you just saw the puppet president Making his rounds in Europe, calling for the removal of Putin or regime change.
[00:03:15.622 --> 00:03:23.583]  Lindsey Graham has put a finer point on it, saying three times on national TV he wants the leader of Russia assassinated by its government.
[00:03:24.944 --> 00:03:33.666]  That is total declaration of war, just like the sanctions, just like overthrowing the Ukrainian government that was elected, that was pro-Russian eight years ago.
[00:03:34.126 --> 00:03:37.627]  Just like bringing weapons into their border, just like funding all the Nazi battalions.
[00:03:39.505 --> 00:04:04.154]  And then myself and many others like Tucker Carlson and Roger Stone get attacked by the National News Joe Rogan for that matter for simply agreeing with former US government policy until about a decade ago that we wouldn't meddle in Ukraine and we wouldn't put weapons in Ukraine and we wouldn't overthrow governments in Ukraine and that we wouldn't threaten to kill heads of state.
[00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:18.248]   So Any diplomat or anybody, Republican or Democrat, ten years ago would agree with me and Tucker Carlson and Roger Stone and Joe Rogan.
[00:04:19.288 --> 00:04:32.499]  But now, everybody from top Democrats to top Republicans are calling yours truly a Russian agent.
[00:04:34.304 --> 00:04:45.636]  All because I'm against this out-of-control escalating war that's being used as the cover for the unbelievable collapse in the production of food and delivery systems around this globe.
[00:04:48.012 --> 00:05:08.745]  But the good news is, and that's the good news, the silver lining in this very dark storm cloud of ongoing, expanding war, not storm clouds of coming war, storm clouds of intensifying war, is that even establishment polls that lean towards war and propaganda and towards Biden, the way they sample and do their polls, they're very skewed.
[00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:13.408]  On average, 15 points for whatever the globalists want in the methodology.
[00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:29.592]  Have support for Biden at 20% or lower for the war, in the low 30s overall support, and in the teens for people believing that he's not gonna get us into a wider war.
[00:05:31.293 --> 00:05:38.359]  So, people really, really get that this guy is a mega, massive disaster.
[00:05:39.144 --> 00:05:43.947]  Now the globalists wanted him to be in there to take the blame for their build back better, collapse civilization.
[00:05:43.967 --> 00:05:45.988]  You've got to collapse civilization to build back better.
[00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:54.854]  When you hear build back better, that means collapse, enslave you, cut your resources off, make you dependent on the system for depopulation efforts that come in the next phase.
[00:05:55.574 --> 00:06:00.277]  But he's so bad that it's really even hurt the new world order now.
[00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:06.281]  As usual, the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[00:06:08.021 --> 00:06:09.461]  And so that's what we're dealing with.
[00:06:09.481 --> 00:06:10.462]  That's what we're facing.
[00:06:10.982 --> 00:06:21.725]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live defending human liberty and peace and justice and the Christian way from deep in the heart of Texas, planet wide.
[00:06:22.445 --> 00:06:25.245]  It is Monday, March 28th, 2022.
[00:06:25.285 --> 00:06:28.026]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and thank you so much for tuning in.
[00:06:28.426 --> 00:06:29.486]  Thank you so much for caring.
[00:06:29.506 --> 00:06:31.107]  Thank you so much for all you do.
[00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:41.727]  And it really hit me Saturday, and I meant to talk about this on the Saturday show we did, the three hour commercial free show, and also the special four hour show we did last night.
[00:06:43.018 --> 00:06:56.167]  And I never made this point, and I really need to make this point, because I've made it here and there, and Trump's made it here and there, but I've not really boiled it down for you and just absolutely laid this out.
[00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:57.728]  Now, I know you're already gonna know this.
[00:06:58.568 --> 00:07:04.953]  I know this too, but I mean, this needs to burn into your mind.
[00:07:07.194 --> 00:07:14.868]   Like if I took this dagger on air and cut my index finger off on TV right now, Everyone would really listen to what I had to say while blood was shooting out, right?
[00:07:15.228 --> 00:07:18.450]  That's like highlighting letters or putting them all in bold.
[00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.571]  It's like, hey, listen to this.
[00:07:20.891 --> 00:07:22.012]  I'm not going to cut my finger off.
[00:07:22.032 --> 00:07:25.134]  It's just a, I have no desire to, don't need to be put in the mental institution.
[00:07:25.154 --> 00:07:26.354]  I'm saying it's a hypothetical.
[00:07:26.515 --> 00:07:27.075]  We'll never do that.
[00:07:29.738 --> 00:07:38.482]  But when Buddhist monks go in Vietnam to try to end the war and pour gasoline on themselves and light themselves on fire and zen out while they die, it really impressed people.
[00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:49.547]  And folks listened to the letter that they had left there on the doorstep of the government building because they killed themselves, it wasn't just one guy, a bunch of them did it, to get the attention of people.
[00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:55.480]  Well guess who's going to be dying if we don't pay attention to this and realize this?
[00:07:56.301 --> 00:07:59.823]  All of us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:03.845 --> 00:08:04.986]  All of us.
[00:08:06.667 --> 00:08:16.098]   Because our civilization, our savings, our future, our freedoms, our due process, Everything, ladies and gentlemen, is being destroyed.
[00:08:16.258 --> 00:08:22.977]   So that monk burned himself up to try to stop the millions dying and to try to make a point of how sick and evil it
[00:08:22.977 --> 00:08:23.258]  was.
[00:08:23.258 --> 00:08:32.258]   And that's my point about the analogy of cutting my finger off.
[00:08:32.475 --> 00:08:37.320]  When I would cut my finger off, I'd cut my arms off to stop what's happening in society.
[00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:38.362]  Wouldn't you?
[00:08:39.022 --> 00:08:40.143]  But that won't get it done.
[00:08:40.163 --> 00:08:43.087]  It's going to take hard work and focus and being strong.
[00:08:44.921 --> 00:08:52.243]  And not letting the globalists drive us into rages, because believe me, when I give you that advice, am I giving it to myself?
[00:08:52.463 --> 00:08:53.443]  I am so pissed.
[00:08:54.103 --> 00:09:05.826]  Last night, I'm sitting there looking at videos from Denver, Colorado, and Austin, Texas, and Chicago, Illinois, and Broward County, Florida, and New York City.
[00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:10.767]  And I mean, it is pedophilia being taught to children.
[00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:29.642]   In the schools and I got I get so pissed that I literally just started yelling at people at the end of the show and had to leave and had to go across the way and sit down for about an hour and settle down because I've been suppressing this anger and it's just, it's so surreal.
[00:09:29.682 --> 00:09:33.184]  I mean, the footage we're putting up here is nothing compared to the actual training manuals.
[00:09:33.584 --> 00:09:38.007]  Five-year-olds being put in transgender closets and told that they're another sex.
[00:09:38.067 --> 00:09:39.928]  I mean, just classic brainwashing.
[00:09:40.308 --> 00:09:43.670]  The way the pedos took over the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts is the same way.
[00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.491]  They're taking over all the institutions.
[00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:46.952]  I mean, this is their army.
[00:09:48.263 --> 00:09:49.905]  And I got so angry at the end of the show.
[00:09:49.945 --> 00:09:51.247]  We had a great two-hour show.
[00:09:51.267 --> 00:09:54.752]  I was handing the baton to Christy Lee and Owen Schroer who did an amazing job.
[00:09:55.333 --> 00:09:58.216]  And I just blew up at the end of the show over some little thing.
[00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:05.290]  Because I was already so disgusted and having so much trouble looking at this.
[00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.391]  So I know why a lot of people tune out.
[00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:11.192]  A lot of people just try to go hide in the country somewhere and try to just get away from everything.
[00:10:11.672 --> 00:10:15.513]  Because you can't stand looking at it and so you can't stand fighting it.
[00:10:15.653 --> 00:10:17.293]  And believe me, I'm not judging you.
[00:10:17.413 --> 00:10:17.754]  I get it.
[00:10:18.234 --> 00:10:23.195]  All I want to do is go get a log cabin and have a farm and never leave the damn thing.
[00:10:24.955 --> 00:10:36.923]  Oh my God, I'm hiring a kite out in the woods with no drugs, no alcohol, no coffee, no nothing, just chopping wood and planting crops and, you know, fiddling around with cows and, you know, beehives and everything else.
[00:10:37.263 --> 00:10:38.784]  That's normal human activity.
[00:10:39.365 --> 00:10:40.265]  Fishing in the stream.
[00:10:41.206 --> 00:10:43.928]  Going over and having dinner with your family by an old cook stove.
[00:10:44.308 --> 00:10:45.228]  That's what it's all about.
[00:10:45.248 --> 00:10:47.070]  And everybody hungers for that and wants that.
[00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.290]  But let me give you a little newsflash.
[00:10:48.791 --> 00:10:52.822]   You're not going to be able To go and hide out.
[00:10:53.022 --> 00:10:56.052]  They're coming for you. They're coming for your children.
[00:10:56.052 --> 00:11:04.512]   And even if you don't have children, ladies and gentlemen, still, these children belong to all of us, and we can't let
[00:11:04.512 --> 00:11:07.022]  these people have them.
[00:11:07.022 --> 00:11:17.022]   Now, let me just make this point to you, then I'm going to come back and cover all the hardcore news in Russia
[00:11:17.022 --> 00:11:23.022]   and the economy and BlackRock and Vanguard and what they're openly announcing and just how horrible this is.
[00:11:23.022 --> 00:11:25.022]  And I just want to stop it.
[00:11:25.078 --> 00:11:30.926]  I want people to wake up and see what's happening and change our evil ways, all of us, myself included, and just stop it!
[00:11:32.469 --> 00:11:34.010]  But you know it's gone too far.
[00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:35.310]  You know it's not going to be stopped.
[00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:41.833]  They'll get stopped in the end by the total collapse, which they themselves are engineering as if that gives them control of it.
[00:11:42.153 --> 00:11:42.933]  See the delusion?
[00:11:43.614 --> 00:11:44.514]  They're trying to play God.
[00:11:48.256 --> 00:11:53.818]  But we can abate the crash landing.
[00:11:54.258 --> 00:11:55.338]  Here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:56.739 --> 00:12:00.060]  We can abate the crash landing.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.361]  And that's all I want to do.
[00:12:02.901 --> 00:12:13.367]  If we can just get the landing gear down and kind of try to slow the plane up and get its nose up, the plane might not totally blow into pieces at 200 miles an hour and we all die in a fireball.
[00:12:13.647 --> 00:12:20.550]  I mean, we can probably land, we might break some arms, break some necks, a few people might die, but we got to try, right?
[00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:21.811]  We got to try to land the plane.
[00:12:22.351 --> 00:12:26.774]  The trajectory, where we're going, everything that's been set into motion, nobody can turn it around.
[00:12:26.834 --> 00:12:28.995]  Not the New World Order, not us, only God.
[00:12:30.285 --> 00:12:36.451]  And you know, we really deserve to have this big, decadent, evil, stinking civilization destroyed, don't we?
[00:12:37.212 --> 00:12:39.013]  But the children are innocent and don't.
[00:12:40.615 --> 00:12:48.242]  But if we don't stand up for the children, then God will allow evil to tear us into pieces.
[00:12:49.564 --> 00:13:12.790]   And the hedge of protection will be lifted, and we will be torn limb from limb and the poor little children with the mask and the poison shots coming after them and all the pedophile training to totally confuse their minds and screw them up for life with their instructors telling them they're another sex and their instructors telling them how to shove things in their rear ends when they're five years old.
[00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.572]  I mean, this is just unspeakable.
[00:13:15.952 --> 00:13:19.955]  Locking schools down right here where I live, a couple miles from our studios.
[00:13:20.575 --> 00:13:30.538]  Locking elementary students in, saying parents can't come in, behind fences, and saying we're teaching the children how to rebel against their parents when they tell them not to be gay.
[00:13:30.778 --> 00:13:31.439]  Five-year-olds!
[00:13:31.959 --> 00:13:32.499]  You're gay!
[00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:33.319]  Your mommy's mean!
[00:13:33.359 --> 00:13:34.480]  She won't let you be who you are!
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:34.800]  What?
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:35.220]  I am?
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:35.760]  Yes!
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.721]  Don't you like other boys?
[00:13:37.761 --> 00:13:38.961]  Well, yeah, I like boys.
[00:13:39.021 --> 00:13:40.141]  Boys like boys to play with boys.
[00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:40.822]  Girls like girls.
[00:13:41.082 --> 00:13:42.322]  And so, well, you're gay!
[00:13:42.362 --> 00:13:43.122]  You're a lesbian!
[00:13:43.142 --> 00:13:43.963]  You're a transgender!
[00:13:44.263 --> 00:13:54.154]   And then, I mean, this is the most horrible, open, satanic abuse you could imagine, and they're just getting started.
[00:13:55.495 --> 00:14:04.379]  And once they start having sex with the kids, and the children are having sex with each other, once all that's going on, once all that's happening, once all that's unfolding...
[00:14:07.216 --> 00:14:29.928]  Then the institutions will start covering up the adult child sex, and the child-on-child sex, and all the perverted criminal activities, just like Boy Scouts, just like Penn State, just like all the major orphanages that have been busted and state-run systems worldwide, just like state-run systems in Germany caught tens of thousands of children per city for decades, just like what you saw in the Vatican.
[00:14:29.968 --> 00:14:48.739]   This is a plan, this is a program, this is a operation, and that's why They hate anyone that exposes this the most, and it's why they attack me, and it's why they try to shut us down, and it's why they sue us, because at the top, and even at the middle levels, the people doing this are agents of this bare minimum.
[00:14:50.114 --> 00:15:07.724]  So when you see my enemies, and you see them, and you see what they do, you know, and you can just look at them and see it anyways, and then study their politics, they're all behind this, that these are pedophiles that want the energy and future and souls of children, and I am blessed to be attacked by the scum of the earth, and to be standing against these pedophiles, and so are you.
[00:15:07.744 --> 00:15:17.289]  So I want to thank you all for joining us in all you do, but I'll give you the big story, the big issue that's so critical that I just preluded to when we come back.
[00:15:18.109 --> 00:15:18.970]  Infowars.com.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.282]  The tip of the spear of human liberty.
[00:15:22.402 --> 00:15:23.583]  Infowars.com.
[00:15:23.803 --> 00:15:24.964]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:15:25.044 --> 00:15:25.825]  Today.
[00:15:26.446 --> 00:15:26.766]  Now.
[00:15:27.006 --> 00:15:28.408]  Go forth and spread the links.
[00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:30.510]  Alright, coming up.
[00:15:33.413 --> 00:15:36.296]  Were the Oscars last night a false flag?
[00:15:37.568 --> 00:15:38.768]  And of course the answer is 100%.
[00:15:42.089 --> 00:15:45.390]  People say, well you don't usually cover entertainment and pop brainwashing and garbage.
[00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:46.330]  I usually don't.
[00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:58.853]  But it's a good illustration of how BS works and how BS operates and how the dying Hollywood system can only pull stunts now for attention.
[00:15:58.913 --> 00:16:04.375]  I'll hit that and lay it out in the last segment of this hour.
[00:16:05.106 --> 00:16:11.613]  Of course, next segment I'll get into the huge news in Russia and Biden making a fool of himself and what's coming out of that.
[00:16:12.894 --> 00:16:19.701]  And Zelensky supposedly now set, as they really do begin to lose, to have talks with the Russians.
[00:16:20.441 --> 00:16:24.305]  We'll be laying all of this out and more here today.
[00:16:24.325 --> 00:16:26.467]  We're going to look at the giant crime waves.
[00:16:27.605 --> 00:16:33.408]  That are exploding not just here but around the world as the police forces are told to stand down and what's behind that.
[00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:45.514]  Now that ties into Larry Fink, George Soros, and of course people like Bill Gates and the whole great reset with the World Economic Forum.
[00:16:45.594 --> 00:16:54.198]  That is a very important group of stacks that I've got here that we're going to be going over today.
[00:16:55.487 --> 00:17:02.551]  And I don't have any guests today because I want to be able to cover the news and I want to be able to take your phone calls.
[00:17:03.351 --> 00:17:07.333]  So we'll be taking calls throughout the second and third hour today.
[00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:09.575]  Okay.
[00:17:10.434 --> 00:17:13.434]  Let me hit the most important point.
[00:17:13.434 --> 00:17:26.234]   The globalists hate us and hate the idea of America because just the idea of private property
[00:17:26.234 --> 00:17:30.754]   and of owning your own land and being able to defend yourself
[00:17:30.754 --> 00:17:35.234]   and raise your children as you see fit and go to the church or not go to the church
[00:17:35.234 --> 00:17:49.624]   of your choosing, Just that idea threatens the neoliberal world government that just sets up liberalism and all of their divide-and-conquer strategies as the new system of control, the new religion.
[00:17:50.244 --> 00:17:53.405]  And they write books about it, and they brag about it, and they all admit it.
[00:17:53.705 --> 00:18:04.304]   And they say globalization, not just jobs and businesses and interdependent things where parts for a car are made in ten different countries or You get your food from a hundred different countries.
[00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:09.848]  Not just interdependence, you know, a big kumbaya world where we all come together to love each other.
[00:18:09.868 --> 00:18:11.209]  That was the lie of the globalists.
[00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:30.223]  But where there's a political ideology of anti-family, anti-God, anti-male, anti-female eugenics that uses that global interdependency that it controls through finance and militaries to carry out social engineering against the public.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:41.035]  And the open declarations now that humans are bad, we must get rid of humans because they put off carbon even though that's part of the carbon cycle and why there's life on this planet.
[00:18:41.336 --> 00:18:44.601]  Just amazing where we've gone in just the last 30 years.
[00:18:46.983 --> 00:19:17.825]   And so when the globalists get outraged at something and when they hate something and when they go after people and when they persecute people and when they do everything they can to silence those individuals but then create an artifice or a straw man of who that person or group is, you know that what that individual or what that group or what that book or what that film has in it Is extremely threatening to the 1984 Brave New World Matrix Society.
[00:19:20.947 --> 00:19:22.989]  And that's why they hate Alex Jones.
[00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.751]  That's why they hate Donald Trump.
[00:19:25.951 --> 00:19:30.075]  Not that Trump's perfect, but he does believe in humans and prosperity and doesn't want to kill everybody.
[00:19:31.076 --> 00:19:45.125]   And because we're popular, and because the ideas we promote are popular, because what you believe in is common sense and popular, You know, prosperity, freedom, security, family, duty, honor, pride in your nation.
[00:19:45.825 --> 00:19:49.887]  All of these things are assailed because they don't want you to want the good thing.
[00:19:50.227 --> 00:19:51.648]  They don't want you to want the steak.
[00:19:51.968 --> 00:19:53.549]  They don't want you to want the swimming pool.
[00:19:53.749 --> 00:19:56.350]  They don't want you to want to be able to travel and go wherever you want.
[00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:05.755]  Not that all that's God, not that we should just worship those freedoms, but if anybody wants to take those things away from you, it's because they want to make you a slave.
[00:20:07.182 --> 00:20:10.963]  And then you better examine who they are and what they stand for.
[00:20:11.803 --> 00:20:24.786]  And then when you do that, you go, whoa, these people basically want to tie us up collectively in the bottom of some dungeon, 20 floors under the ground, and really dominate and hurt and control us.
[00:20:26.007 --> 00:20:28.927]  And then you get the spirit of who these jokers are.
[00:20:32.421 --> 00:20:33.161]  That's where we are.
[00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:45.463]  And so it really hit me Saturday morning when I was hiking by myself that this is an extreme honor to be here on this show.
[00:20:45.503 --> 00:20:52.464]  It's an extreme honor to be one of the few symbols in the world that enrage the pedophile globalist vampires.
[00:20:53.124 --> 00:20:54.005]  They're beyond pedophiles.
[00:20:54.025 --> 00:21:09.950]   Anything that drains children's energy, anything that ruins lives, anything that creates long-term harm, anything that creates new people that'll be twisting things to others, That's all the goal and the destination and the entire universe of these Wraiths.
[00:21:11.932 --> 00:21:20.058]  And so you need to let it sink in that they hate Alex Jones because they hate you with a burning passion.
[00:21:21.184 --> 00:21:27.765]  of every race, color, and creed, because you were made by God, and you have a connection to God, and you have great potential.
[00:21:28.065 --> 00:21:40.428]  So they want to twist you, they want to dumb you down, they want to make you evil, they want to have you do other bad things to people, so that they can engage in this satanic alchemy to extract sorrow and pain.
[00:21:43.768 --> 00:21:53.109]   And you need to really let it sink into you that It's not just the high-level globalists and politicians and corporate leaders and millions that are like this.
[00:21:54.858 --> 00:22:08.782]  They've now converted the majority of Democrats and liberals and communists around the world to literally hate God, hate families, hate themselves, and want whatever is nihilistic and destructive.
[00:22:09.102 --> 00:22:16.225]  They have successfully transmuted that barbarous, satanic spirit into the general public.
[00:22:16.705 --> 00:22:20.826]  And you see people that look completely normal and were nice and sweet five years ago that were liberals.
[00:22:21.346 --> 00:22:44.345]   And by successive approximation, They now support atrocities, torture, surveillance, censorship, and anything the system says or pushes because they have been demoralized, they have been basically destroyed, and they don't get through mass Stockholm Syndrome that they're under and learn helplessness that it's the system hurting them.
[00:22:44.665 --> 00:23:15.857]   They keep believing that if they just keep doubling down and submitting to whatever the orthodoxy is, that they will finally Be transported to this wonderland and this utopia they were promised when they can't admit they were conned and deceived and repent and say, I reject the devil, I reject the world, I reject the system, I reject Hollywood, I reject the universities, I reject neoliberalism and I want to get back to humanity and back to God and start freeing themselves and detoxing from it before it's too late.
[00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:20.351]  I mean, I'm not saying I'm the best looking guy around, but I have fire in my eyes and I'm alive.
[00:23:20.691 --> 00:23:21.291]  And people know it.
[00:23:21.612 --> 00:23:30.934]  You go around universities, you go around liberals, you can't believe how stunted and ugly and weak and hateful and just the men look like they're dead.
[00:23:31.015 --> 00:23:32.755]  The women look like they're half dead.
[00:23:33.155 --> 00:23:35.256]  And you're like, what happened to these people?
[00:23:35.416 --> 00:23:42.138]  And you look at whole seas of people of every color, and they look like zombies in a movie that had their soul taken out of them.
[00:23:42.478 --> 00:23:45.039]  Or Skeksis in the Dark Crystal that have had their essence taken.
[00:23:46.448 --> 00:23:50.509]  And I've seen them deprogrammed, and six months later they're beautiful and alive again.
[00:23:50.769 --> 00:23:52.250]  We can save these people!
[00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:59.872]  But remember, when they're under that satanic spell, they want one thing, to destroy you, and to hurt you, and to dominate you.
[00:24:00.552 --> 00:24:04.193]  They are under a satanic, biomedical spell.
[00:24:05.447 --> 00:24:12.251]  All right, coming up, I'm going to get into the Oscar false flag attack last night with Will Smith and Chris Rock.
[00:24:12.752 --> 00:24:13.872]  Funny, it's a $3 bill.
[00:24:14.233 --> 00:24:16.614]  You're not supposed to question what's done officially.
[00:24:16.874 --> 00:24:18.035]  Don't question Hollywood.
[00:24:18.055 --> 00:24:18.995]  Don't question Biden.
[00:24:19.016 --> 00:24:20.096]  Don't question Zelensky.
[00:24:20.416 --> 00:24:21.397]  Don't question CNN.
[00:24:21.417 --> 00:24:24.819]  But we know they're a pack of liars and frauds and fakes.
[00:24:25.139 --> 00:24:25.860]  They're actors.
[00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:30.940]  I'm not saying all actors are bad, but the whole system itself is disgusting.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.361]  Zelensky's an actor, Sean Penn, all of it.
[00:24:33.861 --> 00:24:34.741]  It's very important.
[00:24:34.781 --> 00:24:38.182]  It ties to the economy, the crime wave, everything that's happening.
[00:24:38.322 --> 00:24:39.923]  I'm going to get to that next segment.
[00:24:39.943 --> 00:24:52.727]  I want to hit Russia and the huge developments there, and then next hour get into some of the graphic footage, viewer discretion advised, of Russian soldiers, it's confirmed, it's real, having their feet, knees, and genitals blown off.
[00:24:53.564 --> 00:24:56.025]  By Ukrainian Nazi battalions.
[00:24:56.065 --> 00:24:59.165]  It is actually one of the main Nazi battalions doing it.
[00:25:00.125 --> 00:25:01.226]  Very serious war crime.
[00:25:01.626 --> 00:25:07.207]  And whether you're for Russia or Ukraine or whatever, or neutral like I am, this is wrong and this needs to be decried.
[00:25:07.247 --> 00:25:13.608]  And if we had footage of the Russians doing this, I would absolutely be against what was unfolding.
[00:25:15.749 --> 00:25:35.605]   So it's very important not to lose your soul in this process, whichever side you're on, and to stand up for human dignity, And basic human rights, because if you take one group's rights, well then you're going to end up having your rights taken usually a lot sooner than you thought.
[00:25:36.499 --> 00:25:40.462]  All right, we have a very exciting announcement on a whole bunch of fronts.
[00:25:41.062 --> 00:25:41.923]  This is very simple.
[00:25:42.623 --> 00:25:43.764]  This is a piece of history.
[00:25:44.384 --> 00:25:45.986]  It's absolutely needed to stay on air.
[00:25:46.806 --> 00:25:55.432]  And it will, in all of my experience, go up in value historically because it's a piece of history and because there's a limited run of these.
[00:25:57.013 --> 00:26:16.818]   And it's also a very, very beautiful art item that also has intrinsic value because it is And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the second installment, there's only going to be three, of the founding member coins at 1776coin.com.
[00:26:17.138 --> 00:26:28.138]   1776coin.com. 1776coin.com takes you to Patriot Collectibles, a site that again had the first
[00:26:28.138 --> 00:26:31.817]   coin, it's going to have more coins, it's going to have a lot of other really interesting
[00:26:31.817 --> 00:26:38.218]   collectibles in the future and it is these offerings that are going to fund a lot of
[00:26:38.218 --> 00:26:39.218]  other.
[00:26:39.432 --> 00:26:48.504]  Other lower price offerings, and this isn't exorbitant, but it's meant to found it and set it up and do a bunch of other things that we're not going to get into yet.
[00:26:48.564 --> 00:26:53.990]  But if we're able to sell the three series, it's going to really help launch a lot of new stuff.
[00:26:54.631 --> 00:26:58.136]  A self-funding, self-operating Patriot collectible system.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:05.982]  That enriches everybody with culture and art, and also going up in value, and keeps us on the air.
[00:27:06.102 --> 00:27:18.787]  And a lot of it's top secret, but very, very soon, we're a little bit behind with all the stuff going on, but very, very soon you'll see a lot of new things getting launched, a lot of things happening, and that's because of you being a founding member.
[00:27:18.927 --> 00:27:32.906]   And everybody that gets one or two or three of the series, if you just have one of the coins, and you sign up when you get it, With your email, you're going to be sent some very, very special things.
[00:27:33.386 --> 00:27:35.707]  And I'm just leaving it at that.
[00:27:35.927 --> 00:27:47.151]  So, last time we sold out of the 10,000 coins of the George Washington anti-tyrant coin, where he's slaying the dragon, and it's got the American Eagle on the other side.
[00:27:47.271 --> 00:27:48.552]  That sold out in 10 days.
[00:27:49.632 --> 00:27:53.494]  We have, again, 10,000 of these coins, same price, at 1776coin.com.
[00:27:53.534 --> 00:27:53.834]  1776coin.com.
[00:27:53.854 --> 00:27:54.814]  That takes you to Patriot.
[00:27:59.056 --> 00:28:07.893]  Collectibles, which some great folks were working with, and a lot of exciting things that are coming in the near future thanks to you giving us the seed money.
[00:28:08.871 --> 00:28:09.371]  To do this.
[00:28:09.471 --> 00:28:13.332]  So, let me tell you about the new coin if you're a radio listener and can't see how powerful it is.
[00:28:13.352 --> 00:28:16.512]  I don't want to say it's better than the last one, but it probably is.
[00:28:16.572 --> 00:28:20.493]  I mean, of the three in the series, I think this one for me is my favorite.
[00:28:21.253 --> 00:28:30.415]  And of course, it's my concepts, and we had a great, very well-known, but he wants to be off-record, coin designer, etcher, that then took my ideas and put it into function.
[00:28:30.455 --> 00:28:32.575]  So it's a collaborative effort here.
[00:28:33.255 --> 00:28:35.696]  But a lot of folks would want to know that this is an Alex Jones design.
[00:28:36.846 --> 00:28:41.271]  It's a beautiful Tree of Liberty with the branches and the roots that are so important.
[00:28:41.411 --> 00:28:45.656]  Founding member, and it says, the Tree of Liberty must be refreshed.
[00:28:47.018 --> 00:28:54.767]  You flip it over, there's the skull, with the blood of patriots and tyrants, the famous Thomas Jefferson quote, founding member coin.
[00:28:55.167 --> 00:28:56.329]  It is dynamite.
[00:28:57.751 --> 00:29:10.659]  It is amazing, it is the highest stamp quality you're going to get, and it's got the markup in it to help us in the face of the enemy launch a lot of beautiful, wonderful things for human liberty and freedom.
[00:29:10.679 --> 00:29:11.679]  So this is a piece of history.

[00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:02.224]  Are you not impressed with what your investment in us has done and how we've devastated the New World Order and completely challenged their whole narrative?
[00:30:02.444 --> 00:30:16.392]  And now the avant-garde, number one talk show host all over the world, whether you're in Romania or Hungary or Russia or Mexico or Brazil or the United States or Canada, are Alex Jones inspired?
[00:30:17.847 --> 00:30:23.327]   And I'm not trying to brag, but I don't really toot my horn, but behind the scenes, people
[00:30:23.327 --> 00:30:24.807]  tell me, "You woke me up.
[00:30:24.807 --> 00:30:25.807]  You did it.
[00:30:25.807 --> 00:30:26.807]  It's incredible.
[00:30:26.807 --> 00:30:27.807]  Thank you."
[00:30:27.807 --> 00:30:28.807]  And a lot of them go on air and say that now.
[00:30:28.807 --> 00:30:31.008]  So, but I didn't do this.
[00:30:31.008 --> 00:30:37.686]   This was 100% a team effort of all of you that put up with me, because sometimes I'm
[00:30:37.686 --> 00:30:38.686]  awesome.
[00:30:38.686 --> 00:30:39.567]  Sometimes I'm like, "Man, you're a jerk."
[00:30:40.094 --> 00:30:46.919]  And this wonderful crew, and all of our sponsors, and our affiliates, and Ted Anderson, and just everybody that has done this.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:55.225]  We have stood up to the most powerful, evil people in the world, like Black Rock, and Vanguard, and the New World Order, and Klaus Schwab.
[00:30:55.586 --> 00:30:59.669]  And it's been hell, it's been rough, but we have come through it together.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.880]  You know, I haven't talked about this yet.
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:04.940]  I'm going to talk about it soon.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:10.441]  There's a lot of reasons that I've waited since last week because I want to show you the specifics and the evidence.
[00:31:10.961 --> 00:31:13.222]  We have the evidence and it's just we are so much going on.
[00:31:13.262 --> 00:31:15.762]  It's hard to put yourself in the news, even though it's important.
[00:31:16.102 --> 00:31:22.984]  They've released the interim report on January 6th and it's exactly what they want to question us about.
[00:31:25.784 --> 00:31:27.364]  And it's full of bull.
[00:31:29.445 --> 00:31:30.345]  We weren't in touch.
[00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:34.192]  With Mark Meadows at the White House.
[00:31:34.232 --> 00:31:35.915]  We weren't planning to attack the Capitol.
[00:31:36.396 --> 00:31:37.077]  And they know that.
[00:31:37.177 --> 00:31:41.024]  They've got all the text messages of everybody.
[00:31:41.244 --> 00:31:45.151]  But they're right back at that, ladies and gentlemen, because that's what they do.
[00:31:47.935 --> 00:31:48.996]  It's just preposterous.
[00:31:49.856 --> 00:31:53.778]  Hey, you better come tell us what's going on or we're going to up the charges on Owen Schroeder.
[00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:55.660]  That's the tip of the iceberg, folks.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.602]  That's the type of mafia, gangster crap this country has going on.
[00:31:59.902 --> 00:32:02.664]  And a lot of folks will be like, well, I better bow down to these people then.
[00:32:02.724 --> 00:32:03.064]  I better...
[00:32:03.724 --> 00:32:04.605]  I better shut up.
[00:32:04.685 --> 00:32:06.526]  I mean, they're the bad people.
[00:32:06.566 --> 00:32:07.826]  We've done absolutely nothing.
[00:32:08.187 --> 00:32:14.430]  So I have zero fear because I could stand before God and know that I have not been involved in anything criminal.
[00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:19.793]  I have not been involved in January 6th trying to attack that stupid Capitol and make us all look like idiots.
[00:32:19.833 --> 00:32:20.793]  Why the hell would I do that?
[00:32:20.813 --> 00:32:21.874]  I have the opposite motive.
[00:32:21.914 --> 00:32:23.035]  I wanted a 10-day investigation.
[00:32:23.055 --> 00:32:25.856]  But I'm just telling you, Owen's a real trooper.
[00:32:26.196 --> 00:32:30.018]  And I don't know if we're going to get into all of it yet, but I just, I can't help myself.
[00:32:30.338 --> 00:32:31.519]  It's just, it's unbelievable.
[00:32:31.599 --> 00:32:32.840]  I mean, to our faces.
[00:32:33.908 --> 00:32:40.003]  Directly to us, the feds are like... basic... I can't even believe this country.
[00:32:40.103 --> 00:32:41.206]  I mean, it's like...
[00:32:42.463 --> 00:32:49.445]  Even if you're not naive like me, you still don't expect the Justice Department to be openly bad guys and openly proud of it.
[00:32:49.605 --> 00:32:50.805]  But they all think it's cool.
[00:32:50.865 --> 00:32:56.287]  They all think it's powerful, and they're winning, and oh, they're invincible.
[00:32:56.627 --> 00:32:59.508]  And I'm just like, look, I'm not your enemy, and I'm not fighting with you.
[00:32:59.628 --> 00:33:00.708]  I wanted to save the country.
[00:33:01.348 --> 00:33:03.109]  I'll get out of your way while you destroy yourselves.
[00:33:03.189 --> 00:33:05.149]  Okay, all right, then, okay.
[00:33:05.929 --> 00:33:08.110]  I'm just trying to build a new system, build a new America.
[00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:11.491]  I'm trying to get people to not support the corrupt, evil system and protect their children.
[00:33:12.208 --> 00:33:15.390]  And it takes funds to do it, so get the coin while you still can.
[00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:16.230]  It's going to sell out.
[00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:20.892]  A lot of them are selling for two, three times what they were on eBay and Auctions right now.
[00:33:21.212 --> 00:33:27.015]  So I would get your 1776 coin, part two of the Liberty Tree, the Tree of Liberty, at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:33:27.035 --> 00:33:30.377]  You'll find the link or 1776coin.com.
[00:33:30.397 --> 00:33:30.897]  Stay with us.
[00:33:31.978 --> 00:33:38.781]  Taking on the globalists at point-blank range and winning hearts and minds worldwide.
[00:33:42.847 --> 00:33:46.650]  Now, there's a tactic they use that lets them continue to win.
[00:33:49.973 --> 00:34:04.867]  The New World Order, Klaus Schwab, Joe Biden, the Clintons, Obama, who's supposed to be their rock star worldwide, Hollywood, their whole system has less than a 20% approval rating.
[00:34:05.828 --> 00:34:07.269]  And it's rapidly declining.
[00:34:11.865 --> 00:34:15.505]  And so it's a delusional cult that's already run out of gas.
[00:34:15.505 --> 00:34:28.185]   But when you see all the headlines, "Oh, Joe Biden is the reason
[00:34:28.185 --> 00:34:30.145]  America has high gas prices."
[00:34:30.672 --> 00:34:32.973]  Joe Biden's the reason America looks stupid.
[00:34:32.993 --> 00:34:34.894]  Joe Biden's the reason the borders are open.
[00:34:38.618 --> 00:34:46.483]  And at the end of the day, yeah, I mean, Joe Biden's the titular head of the group doing that, but he's meant to be blamed.
[00:34:46.863 --> 00:34:51.266]  That's why he was put in there, because he was dumb enough to want to be there during the collapse.
[00:34:51.707 --> 00:35:05.456]  He would take the job of, while they're collapsing America and collapsing the world and going into the next stage of the deindustrialization, Agenda 2030, Agenda 21, New World Order, that he was willing to be that guy.
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:13.549]  He's always been arrogant, always been corrupt, and has been out of his mind for at least five, six years.
[00:35:15.492 --> 00:35:20.740]  But he's so degenerate and degenerated so fast that it's even blowing up in their face now.
[00:35:21.758 --> 00:35:29.463]  So they're up late at night, Larry Fink and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, worried you're going to research bioweapon labs they run.
[00:35:29.823 --> 00:35:31.885]  Worried you're going to look at what dictators they're funding.
[00:35:32.285 --> 00:35:36.227]  Worried that you're going to find out how they're funding all the transgenderism and open borders.
[00:35:36.528 --> 00:35:38.469]  Worried that you're going to learn about replacement migration.
[00:35:39.169 --> 00:35:42.771]  Worried that you're going to learn that they run the corporate world government.
[00:35:43.052 --> 00:36:02.086]   And then instead of puppets getting the blame, like Joe Biden or Gordon Brown, Or any of these people that have come and gone, Bill Clinton, instead of focusing on the puppets, and with Bill Clinton, he was somewhat in charge, interfacing with the globalists, but he was still a puppet.
[00:36:02.346 --> 00:36:03.307]  But with Biden, he's a pure puppet.
[00:36:04.027 --> 00:36:05.248]  Kamala Harris, pure puppet.
[00:36:05.689 --> 00:36:07.710]  Not from Alzheimer's, but I mean, she is a puppet.
[00:36:09.872 --> 00:36:11.754]  Without even the Alzheimer's, she was born a puppet.
[00:36:14.764 --> 00:36:17.806]  And so you've got to recognize it's a fraud.
[00:36:17.826 --> 00:36:20.128]  You've got to realize they're basically actors.
[00:36:20.588 --> 00:36:24.751]  Jen Psaki's meant to be up there and be hated and everyone reviled her.
[00:36:24.932 --> 00:36:25.752]  She was chosen.
[00:36:25.972 --> 00:36:28.854]  She thinks she's really smart and cool on a winning team.
[00:36:29.095 --> 00:36:30.996]  She doesn't know she was chosen to be hated.
[00:36:31.496 --> 00:36:34.058]  Kamala Harris doesn't know she was chosen to be hated.
[00:36:34.378 --> 00:36:35.900]  Joe Biden was chosen to be hated.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.922]  I mean, she didn't have, Kamala Harris didn't have half a point.
[00:36:40.723 --> 00:36:46.150]  With black Americans out of 15 candidates for the Democratic nomination two years ago.
[00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:46.510]  Remember?
[00:36:49.674 --> 00:36:52.638]  With white ding-a-lings, she had about a point and a half.
[00:36:53.299 --> 00:36:54.881]  Black people, about half a point.
[00:36:55.462 --> 00:36:59.367]  Black people are like, number one, this lady ain't black, and number two, she's fake as hell.
[00:37:00.908 --> 00:37:09.313]  She was chosen because they want when all this bad stuff happens and there's an angrier world and you all get mad, you blame them.
[00:37:09.414 --> 00:37:14.997]  Not the Democratic Party, not the globalists that control them, but these individuals because they know how our brains work.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:23.503]  It's like WWF wrestling and you got the Iron Sheik versus Hulk Hogan and they go get beers after.
[00:37:26.945 --> 00:37:28.286]  So that takes us to the Oscars.
[00:37:29.226 --> 00:37:33.841]   The Oscars In the 1980s, had 80 million viewers.
[00:37:34.121 --> 00:37:37.563]  It was as big as the Super Bowl is today.
[00:37:39.064 --> 00:37:39.424]  Look it up.
[00:37:39.904 --> 00:37:40.865]  Where is it now?
[00:37:41.485 --> 00:37:44.667]  Oscars evaporating ratings.
[00:37:45.007 --> 00:37:47.249]  In 2011, they had 37.9 million viewers.
[00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:50.851]  Last year, it was 10 million.
[00:37:50.891 --> 00:38:03.017]   We don't know the numbers from last night, but you know, hundreds of millions, billions are watching Will Smith slap The comedian.
[00:38:05.325 --> 00:38:05.806]  Chris Rock.
[00:38:08.177 --> 00:38:10.739]  And so, of course, now how do we know this is staged?
[00:38:11.319 --> 00:38:16.583]  Well, about a thousand different angles and points go into it that your mind, the supercomputer can look at and figure out.
[00:38:16.923 --> 00:38:23.567]  You subconsciously say it's fake, you consciously think it's fake, because you have all these factors your brain has put together and then told you it's fake.
[00:38:23.787 --> 00:38:27.090]  It's not called intuition, it's called the supercomputer giving you the answer.
[00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:31.132]  And then you try to understand all the formulations that your incredible brain came up with.
[00:38:31.473 --> 00:38:37.697]  An ant's brain is a billion times smarter than the best AI computer, top computer scientists will tell you.
[00:38:38.417 --> 00:38:39.359]  And how powerful is our brain?
[00:38:39.699 --> 00:38:40.460]  Oh, we're garbage.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:41.181]  Oh, we're filth.
[00:38:41.522 --> 00:38:42.503]  Oh, we're bad for the earth.
[00:38:42.864 --> 00:38:47.850]  The globalists want us to decide to hate ourselves, so we'll subserve our incredible will to them.
[00:38:49.813 --> 00:38:50.714]  But back to Hollywood.
[00:38:51.673 --> 00:38:52.313]  How do I know?
[00:38:52.374 --> 00:39:02.800]  Well, Hollywood has the motive, with no one watching and caring, to put the Oscars back in the news and make you think about it, and make you watch it, to wonder, hey, next year, what's going to be happening at the Oscars?
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:11.066]  And then now, you'll go watch more of what happened, and now everybody that was there, all these empty, soulless people, can talk about how they witnessed it and how they saw it.
[00:39:11.566 --> 00:39:16.870]  It was like a geek at a carnival, biting the head off of a rat or a bat.
[00:39:19.741 --> 00:39:27.907]  Hollywood has collapsed, its viewership has evaporated, it is eating its own, and it has no real viewers.
[00:39:29.768 --> 00:39:34.111]  So, billions of people are going to watch Will Smith slap Chris Rock.
[00:39:38.635 --> 00:39:39.035]  Billions.
[00:39:39.716 --> 00:39:43.098]  But, when the numbers come out, probably 10 million watched it last night.
[00:39:43.778 --> 00:39:44.279]  Worldwide.
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.901]  Joe Rogan has more viewers than that every day.
[00:39:48.353 --> 00:39:49.934]  Before they censored us, we had more than every day.
[00:39:50.254 --> 00:39:51.434]  In two days, we had more than that.
[00:39:51.854 --> 00:39:56.015]  We have more viewers than them, on a big day, than they had last night.
[00:39:56.055 --> 00:40:00.577]  And they get ready for this all year, and spend hundreds of millions of dollars on it.
[00:40:04.758 --> 00:40:06.259]  So, of course, it's a false flag.
[00:40:06.519 --> 00:40:16.142]  They stand to gain, it's all there, and then you watch him over-slapping, and the hand go through all stylized, and then Chris Rock act like he's confused, he doesn't know what's happened.
[00:40:18.117 --> 00:40:21.919]  You see the wives all super excited before it happens, after it happens.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.241]  You see the body language.
[00:40:24.261 --> 00:40:25.822]  You see him laughing along with it.
[00:40:28.223 --> 00:40:29.284]  You see it all.
[00:40:30.084 --> 00:40:31.245]  I mean, the bad acting.
[00:40:31.325 --> 00:40:32.746]  Strutting back to his wife.
[00:40:33.146 --> 00:40:34.487]  Strutting back with the Oscar.
[00:40:34.507 --> 00:40:36.308]  Because no one cares about the Oscar.
[00:40:36.568 --> 00:40:38.089]  No one cares about the Nobel Prize.
[00:40:38.249 --> 00:40:39.170]  Because they've cheapened it.
[00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:40.290]  They've made it a joke.
[00:40:40.531 --> 00:40:42.332]  And now they've cheapened it even more.
[00:40:42.592 --> 00:40:46.534]  You've just been exposed to a false flag, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:46.774 --> 00:40:47.595]  And yet, is he slapping?
[00:40:48.973 --> 00:40:51.615]  Yeah, he slapped him a lot of times in movies and things.
[00:40:51.955 --> 00:40:55.578]  They will tell you, if the actors agree, to go ahead and actually take a hit.
[00:40:56.238 --> 00:41:04.504]  I never wanted to be, or really pushed to be in movies, but Rick Linklater's a friend of mine, stuck me in a few of his movies, and he said with the stunt people, do you mind falling down when they taser you and don't let them drag your knees?
[00:41:05.064 --> 00:41:10.408]  And I got bloody knees with them dragging me into the SWAT team vehicle, because I said, yeah, I want to do this like it's real.
[00:41:11.229 --> 00:41:22.847]   Well, You have about that hard across the face and now every person on earth with a computer or with the internet is going to end up watching this clip we're going to play right now.
[00:41:22.867 --> 00:41:27.451]  Jada, I love you.
[00:41:27.811 --> 00:41:28.171]  G.I.
[00:41:28.211 --> 00:41:28.772]  Jane too.
[00:41:28.872 --> 00:41:36.759]  Can't wait to see it.
[00:41:37.019 --> 00:41:37.259]  Alright?
[00:41:37.279 --> 00:41:38.420]  That was a nice one.
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:38.781]  Okay.
[00:41:40.235 --> 00:41:41.556]  I'm out here!
[00:41:41.676 --> 00:41:42.656]  Uh-oh!
[00:41:42.836 --> 00:41:43.417]  Richard!
[00:41:43.537 --> 00:41:48.060]  Oh, wow!
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.742]  Wow!
[00:41:50.782 --> 00:41:52.724]  Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:59.242]  Keep my wife's name out your fucking mouth!
[00:41:59.343 --> 00:42:00.343]  Wow, dude!
[00:42:00.983 --> 00:42:01.204]  Yes.
[00:42:01.484 --> 00:42:02.544]  It was a G.I.
[00:42:02.664 --> 00:42:03.445]  Jane joke.
[00:42:03.505 --> 00:42:08.388]  Keep my wife's name out your fucking mouth!
[00:42:08.508 --> 00:42:10.149]  I'm going to, okay?
[00:42:10.169 --> 00:42:10.989]  Oh, he looks real.
[00:42:11.029 --> 00:42:11.610]  No, that's acting.
[00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:13.691]  Oh, okay.
[00:42:16.332 --> 00:42:20.054]  That was the greatest night in the history of television.
[00:42:20.074 --> 00:42:21.815]  Okay.
[00:42:22.276 --> 00:42:22.636]  Okay.
[00:42:24.048 --> 00:42:30.070]  So we are here to give a documentary out, to give an Oscar out.
[00:42:31.011 --> 00:42:32.651]  Now you saw the big tell, right?
[00:42:34.092 --> 00:42:37.834]  It's something they do in the WWE, WWF before they change the name.
[00:42:39.074 --> 00:42:41.915]  He stomps his foot when he slaps him.
[00:42:43.016 --> 00:42:55.000]   Play the part with him slapping him again and you hear this big... And again, ladies and gentlemen, The strutting back after he did it is like high school quality acting.
[00:42:55.781 --> 00:42:56.421]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:57.201 --> 00:42:59.882]  High school, and look, he's leaning out to get the shot.
[00:42:59.843 --> 00:43:00.343]  Boom.
[00:43:00.343 --> 00:43:09.202]  He's even waiting for it.
[00:43:07.986 --> 00:43:10.147]  He's got his cheek out to take it.
[00:43:10.707 --> 00:43:12.108]  He actually sticks his cheek out.
[00:43:12.188 --> 00:43:13.168]  I mean, look at the bad acting.
[00:43:13.248 --> 00:43:13.909]  Back it up again.
[00:43:15.429 --> 00:43:19.191]  Chris Rock, this is a false flag.
[00:43:20.959 --> 00:43:27.603]  And two actors just did it on the stage to try to get attention to gin up support for the collapsed Academy of Awards.
[00:43:28.104 --> 00:43:30.065]  That is nothing but a giant total joke.
[00:43:30.445 --> 00:43:35.528]  Sticks the cheek out, braces, gets ready for it, leans into what arm it's going to come in.
[00:43:35.549 --> 00:43:37.370]  They've already rehearsed this 20 times.
[00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:38.110]  Boom!
[00:43:38.951 --> 00:43:39.411]  That's it!
[00:43:40.372 --> 00:43:41.592]  InfoWars.com.
[00:43:41.612 --> 00:43:42.453]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:43:42.473 --> 00:43:44.895]  But you're not supposed to question, right?
[00:43:46.115 --> 00:43:47.655]  Everything Hollywood says is real.
[00:43:47.735 --> 00:43:48.516]  None of it's fake.
[00:43:49.016 --> 00:43:49.916]  Hollywood's real.
[00:43:49.976 --> 00:43:50.716]  Disney's real.
[00:43:51.877 --> 00:43:53.097]  Men Becoming Women is real.
[00:43:53.137 --> 00:43:54.017]  The Easter Bunny's real.
[00:43:54.077 --> 00:43:55.017]  Santa Claus is real.
[00:43:55.097 --> 00:44:15.418]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:44:15.498 --> 00:44:18.340]  And that is because the economy is breaking down.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.461]  Inflation is exploding.
[00:44:19.761 --> 00:44:21.302]  The supply chains have broken down.
[00:44:22.022 --> 00:44:27.046]  And InfoWars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for operations.
[00:44:27.086 --> 00:44:32.169]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their main move.
[00:44:32.449 --> 00:44:35.531]  InfoWars, it's paradoxical, is more popular than ever.
[00:44:35.631 --> 00:44:38.053]  It is reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[00:44:38.473 --> 00:44:45.919]  But, because of costs increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.

[00:45:06.195 --> 00:45:08.196]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:45:09.516 --> 00:45:11.717]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:45:12.918 --> 00:45:24.683]  Alright, I'm going to hit the big Russia news, the crime wave news, the economy news, and then at the bottom of the hour, for at least an hour and a half, we're going to take your phone call, so I'll be giving that number out next segment.
[00:45:25.868 --> 00:45:27.808]  And opening up the phone system.
[00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:29.229]  It's a computerized phone system, folks.
[00:45:29.249 --> 00:45:31.769]  So don't waste your time calling until it opens up.
[00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:34.750]  We're going to open it up when I get the number out next segment.
[00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:36.131]  So thank you so much for tuning in.
[00:45:36.431 --> 00:45:37.911]  But I want to air this Gregg Reese report.
[00:45:37.951 --> 00:45:38.771]  It's so powerful.
[00:45:39.131 --> 00:45:40.172]  Just went up on Friday.
[00:45:40.232 --> 00:45:41.372]  Needs to get millions of views.
[00:45:41.392 --> 00:45:42.912]  I think it's only got like 300,000 views.
[00:45:43.492 --> 00:45:46.753]  And it's Pfizer comes for the babies now.
[00:45:47.874 --> 00:45:48.714]  Only 211,000 views.
[00:45:49.354 --> 00:45:52.895]  Pfizer seeks approval to inject infants with deadly gene therapy shots.
[00:45:52.915 --> 00:45:53.235]  Here it is.
[00:45:54.488 --> 00:46:07.142]  Because some human beings care about their children, VAERS was established in 1990 as an early warning system to identify negative reactions and side effects of vaccination.
[00:46:08.203 --> 00:46:08.924]  Which makes sense.
[00:46:09.665 --> 00:46:10.926]  But there are major problems.
[00:46:11.726 --> 00:46:20.411]  It is managed by the FDA and the CDC, which explains why the VAERS database requires a class to learn how to find anything.
[00:46:21.191 --> 00:46:24.993]  Taking the time to actually file a report is voluntary.
[00:46:25.733 --> 00:46:36.699]  And out of fear of losing their jobs or being considered an anti-vaxxer, nobody wants to speak ill of the all-holy vaccine, let alone make an official report.
[00:46:37.739 --> 00:46:42.742]  It is estimated that only 1% of vaccine injuries ever get reported to VAERS.
[00:46:43.622 --> 00:46:56.207]  So that means when VAERS reports over 44,000 adverse reactions and 90 deaths, one can expect it to be as much as 4.4 million adverse reactions and 9,000 deaths.
[00:46:57.788 --> 00:47:01.313]  And these numbers are only from the age 5 to 17 group.
[00:47:01.973 --> 00:47:15.891]  Conservative numbers put it at 10%, which is half a million children that have been wounded and killed from an unneeded, unwanted, experimental gene therapy shot that we relied to about every step of the way.
[00:47:17.463 --> 00:47:26.227]  Thanks to the Open VAERS project, which is built upon the VAERS data, the public can easily search these reports and see for themselves.
[00:47:27.027 --> 00:47:36.531]  People are reporting adverse reactions such as chronic pain, loss of hearing and taste, talking gibberish, and acting out aggressively.
[00:47:37.272 --> 00:47:38.732]  And these are the mild cases.
[00:47:39.572 --> 00:47:44.475]  There is a tsunami of major brain damage, heart disease, and fatalities.
[00:47:46.056 --> 00:47:58.326]  Edward Dowd has analyzed the data and has reported an 84% increase in deaths among ages 25 through 40, which is the same amount of lives lost to the Vietnam War.
[00:47:59.447 --> 00:48:06.974]  Toby Rogers estimates that Big Pharma kills twice as many people that died in World War II every single year.
[00:48:08.055 --> 00:48:10.897]  The press ignores this because it's not enough.
[00:48:11.758 --> 00:48:13.980]  They want your newborn babies as well.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:25.427]  Pfizer is pushing to have children as young as six months old, given a shot that we know is potentially fatal, even though children were never at risk and are still not at risk.
[00:48:26.248 --> 00:48:35.674]  The United States has been force injecting infants and children with experimental vaccines for years, and now they want to add the infamous clot shot.
[00:48:36.274 --> 00:48:41.218]  Thanks to virtue signaling mothers, some children have already been getting it in the womb.
[00:48:41.898 --> 00:48:50.426]  Which is resulting in miscarriages, stillbirths, and deaths from breastfeeding on toxic, genetically modified mother's milk.
[00:48:51.367 --> 00:48:57.953]  Pfizer is planning on submitting another application for emergency use authorization in early April.
[00:48:58.573 --> 00:49:06.700]  That's about 18 million children under 5 who could be sacrificed to the altar of big pharma and political correctness.
[00:49:07.481 --> 00:49:26.477]  If Pfizer can achieve permanent liability protection from the FDA, who they control, then they can add the mRNA gene therapy shot to the childhood vaccine schedule, where it will enjoy permanent liability protection under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.
[00:49:27.318 --> 00:49:35.165]  These same crooks are putting a judge on the Supreme Court who openly defends leniency towards crimes that involve child rape.
[00:49:36.707 --> 00:49:39.429]  They're coming for your children and they will not stop.
[00:49:40.469 --> 00:49:51.016]  If you still care about the human race and are looking for something you can do right now, you can go to Toby Rogers at Substack and read his urgent call to action for more info.
[00:49:52.257 --> 00:49:54.458]  Reporting for Info Wars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:10.260]   Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the most censored, lied about, demonized, hated Broadcast in the world by globalists, by pedophiles, by devil worshippers, by trash, by thieves.
[00:50:11.922 --> 00:50:25.194]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, you will know a man by his enemies, and I am very blessed to have these enemies, but I'm way more blessed to have you as listeners and viewers that stand with us in the incredible quest we're involved in.
[00:50:25.755 --> 00:50:28.537]  It is so historical, and every day is more insane than the last.
[00:50:29.372 --> 00:50:39.095]  I'm going to give the number out right now, and I'm going to start taking calls at the bottom of the hour, in 23 minutes, on any subject you want to cover.
[00:50:39.335 --> 00:50:43.316]  Long-time callers, first-time callers, people that agree, people that disagree.
[00:50:43.756 --> 00:50:54.780]  But I will put first-time callers at the head of the line, so be honest about it, but please tell me if you are a first-time caller, or if you're calling from some really faraway country, we tend to put you to the front of the line as well.
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:58.101]  If not, we just go in the order the calls are received.
[00:50:59.653 --> 00:51:01.554]  What do you make of the latest developments in Ukraine?
[00:51:01.574 --> 00:51:03.214]  What do you make about the economic system?
[00:51:03.634 --> 00:51:05.475]  What do you make about what BlackRock's been announcing?
[00:51:05.495 --> 00:51:06.895]  I'm going to get to that coming up next segment.
[00:51:07.375 --> 00:51:09.916]  What do you think about the false flag at the Oscars last night?
[00:51:11.176 --> 00:51:15.378]  You're not supposed to question whether it's fake or not when it's as phony as plastic fruit.
[00:51:15.398 --> 00:51:19.419]  It's like walking into a store and they've got a table out and you go, is that real fruit or plastic?
[00:51:19.459 --> 00:51:20.199]  Anybody can tell you.
[00:51:20.499 --> 00:51:21.059]  It's plastic.
[00:51:21.079 --> 00:51:21.600]  Well, how do you know?
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:22.480]  You're not a biologist.
[00:51:23.339 --> 00:51:25.580]  You're not a farmer, you're not an ornithologist.
[00:51:26.081 --> 00:51:30.143]  So somebody asked me, is that a penguin or is that an eagle?
[00:51:30.564 --> 00:51:37.468]  And I'm like, well, it's walking on the ground, it's about three feet tall, it's got a white belly and black body and waddling around, it's a penguin.
[00:51:37.748 --> 00:51:39.810]  Well, you can't say that, you're not an ornithologist.
[00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:42.271]  Well, what is a woman, judge?
[00:51:42.391 --> 00:51:46.694]  I don't know what a woman is, because I only do what I'm told.
[00:51:46.734 --> 00:51:50.120]   Well, ladies and gentlemen, We are not those people.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:52:09.214]  This is an open, free country still, because we say it is, and we're going to exercise our freedom and ignore the censors and the control freaks, and we're going to defend the OACs of liberty and freedom and free speech and Americana that still exist and are now more bright in this darkness than they've ever been.
[00:52:09.034 --> 00:52:14.034]  So the toll free number is 877-789-2539.
[00:52:14.034 --> 00:52:18.034]  877-789-Alex.
[00:52:18.034 --> 00:52:22.034]  877-789-2539.
[00:52:22.318 --> 00:52:25.500]  You can see it right there on your screen.
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:34.764]  All right, I'm going to get into the Russia-Ukraine situation and where all that's going here.
[00:52:37.126 --> 00:52:41.288]  And then, as I said, I'm going to hit some of the geopolitical financial blackrock news next segment.
[00:52:42.008 --> 00:52:43.149]  And then we'll go to your phone calls.
[00:52:44.363 --> 00:52:47.484]  But let's go back to a clip already played last hour because it's so important.
[00:52:47.964 --> 00:52:53.845]  This is Biden running around in Europe saying Vladimir Putin, quote, cannot remain in power.
[00:52:55.365 --> 00:53:00.647]  So in this hour, let the words of Pope John Paul burn as brightly today.
[00:53:01.687 --> 00:53:03.467]  Never, ever give up hope.
[00:53:04.327 --> 00:53:05.008]  Never doubt.
[00:53:05.768 --> 00:53:06.528]  Never tire.
[00:53:07.008 --> 00:53:08.708]  Never become discouraged.
[00:53:09.028 --> 00:53:11.028]  Be not afraid.
[00:53:11.028 --> 00:53:18.028]  [Applause]
[00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:26.028]   A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people's love for liberty.
[00:53:26.835 --> 00:53:30.439]  Brutality will never grind down their will to be free.
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:34.343]  Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia.
[00:53:35.084 --> 00:53:39.228]  For free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness.
[00:53:40.253 --> 00:53:48.096]  We will have a different future, a brighter future, rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light, of decency and dignity, of freedom and possibilities.
[00:53:48.936 --> 00:53:52.957]  For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power.
[00:53:55.798 --> 00:53:56.499]  Regime change.
[00:53:56.559 --> 00:54:05.802]  Suddenly, though, it was rebuked and rebuffed by world leaders and by his own Secretary of State, because Biden isn't running anything.
[00:54:06.458 --> 00:54:11.818]   and when you call for killing or removing leaders that is an open act of war
[00:54:11.818 --> 00:54:14.938]   and they are a nuclear power and if we go down that road well
[00:54:14.938 --> 00:54:18.217]   I got another clip here and I don't want to attack Sean Hannity but man
[00:54:18.217 --> 00:54:23.177]   he came out and said bomb the Russian convoy three weeks ago
[00:54:23.177 --> 00:54:30.297]   a la highway of death Iraq first Iraq war two thousand and 1991
[00:54:30.297 --> 00:54:37.657]   second was 2003 and Sean Hannity's come back again and called for a nuclear war
[00:54:37.886 --> 00:54:39.528]  He says we can't be wimps.
[00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:44.376]  It's quote, off the face of the earth, he says.
[00:54:44.416 --> 00:54:49.083]  Humanity needs to all basically die, I guess, according to Hannity.
[00:54:50.933 --> 00:54:52.514]  Well, here's the deal, Sean.
[00:54:52.334 --> 00:55:01.974]   off the face of the earth if they use WMDs we can't cower in fear over mutually assured
[00:55:01.974 --> 00:55:02.974]  destruction.
[00:55:02.974 --> 00:55:05.574]  Well, here's the deal, Sean.
[00:55:05.574 --> 00:55:13.614]   Iraq didn't have WMDs that were deployable, but Russia does and so do we.
[00:55:14.352 --> 00:55:27.843]  And so you can't say that, and see, Zelensky is, and you've already seen the UN and the globalists do this in Syria, staged chemical attacks and say that Assad did it, but later it came out it was the White Helmets doing it.
[00:55:29.625 --> 00:55:48.751]  So again, when you set the stage, as Zelensky and others have said, that if there's any chemical or biological attacks that they claim the Russians did, but they don't even have proof, that then we use nuclear weapons on the Russians, and the Russians will instantly counter-strike wherever the nuclear weapon came from with an attack.
[00:55:51.192 --> 00:55:53.552]  That's why all the biggest brains have looked at this for 60, 70 years.
[00:55:55.532 --> 00:55:57.853]  It's called Mutually Assured Destruction.
[00:55:58.153 --> 00:55:59.354]  And Hannity is quoted.
[00:55:59.654 --> 00:56:00.414]  There's video of this.
[00:56:02.295 --> 00:56:04.256]  In fact, I think I forgot to tell the crew to get the video.
[00:56:04.416 --> 00:56:04.896]  Get that video.
[00:56:04.916 --> 00:56:05.857]  I want to play it next segment.
[00:56:06.057 --> 00:56:06.977]  You've got to hear this for yourself.
[00:56:07.557 --> 00:56:11.739]  He's debating Tulsi Gabbard, and he says, well put the quotes back up there.
[00:56:11.779 --> 00:56:20.883]  He says that we can't be intimidated, we can't be pushed around, we can't cower in fear, that's a quote, over mutually assured destruction.
[00:56:21.103 --> 00:56:22.444]  What do you mean, cower in fear?
[00:56:26.161 --> 00:56:36.066]  So he's going along with the whole narrative when he's got a family in New York City that is one of the main targets of those Russian submarines sitting offshore 12 miles?
[00:56:38.267 --> 00:56:41.149]  And his answer would be, well, we'll nuke them better than them.
[00:56:41.169 --> 00:56:44.571]  Okay, well, they'll shoot us 100 times and we'll shoot them 300 times.
[00:56:44.931 --> 00:56:45.851]  It doesn't matter.
[00:56:48.233 --> 00:56:51.274]  They'll shoot us 5,000 times, we'll shoot them 15,000 times.
[00:56:51.314 --> 00:56:51.454]  What?
[00:56:53.919 --> 00:57:04.784]  That's why it's called mutually assured destruction, because you've got to be mad and out of your mind to first strike somebody.
[00:57:04.904 --> 00:57:05.565]  Oh, and it gets better.
[00:57:07.646 --> 00:57:13.208]  The Kremlin calls Biden's regime change comments alarming, but appears unwilling to escalate rhetoric.
[00:57:14.609 --> 00:57:19.751]  Meanwhile, Biden on Saturday said he refuses to rule out first strike use of U.S.
[00:57:19.811 --> 00:57:23.395]   nuclear weapons Under extreme circumstances.
[00:57:23.736 --> 00:57:24.236]  Oh, okay.
[00:57:25.577 --> 00:57:26.278]  What does that mean?
[00:57:27.239 --> 00:57:28.600]  First use of nuclear weapons.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.281]  What's the extreme circumstance?
[00:57:30.141 --> 00:57:32.701]  Oh, the Russians are driving out certain forces?
[00:57:32.701 --> 00:57:42.059]   Hannity, nuke Russia off the face of the earth if they use WMDs.
[00:57:42.192 --> 00:57:45.815]  We can't cower in fear over mutually assured destruction.
[00:57:47.967 --> 00:57:52.472]  Secretary of State Blinken walks back Biden's unscripted declaration that Putin cannot remain in power.
[00:57:54.574 --> 00:58:01.922]  World shocked by torture and executions of Russian soldiers at hands of Ukraine Nazi battalions, actually wearing the Nazi patches.
[00:58:04.365 --> 00:58:05.346]  Inconsistent with U.S.
[00:58:05.386 --> 00:58:09.811]  goals, Western analysts slam Biden's call for regime change in Russia.
[00:58:12.125 --> 00:58:12.465]  Poll!
[00:58:12.485 --> 00:58:16.908]  8 in 10 Americans worried Biden bumbling could lead to nuclear war.
[00:58:17.269 --> 00:58:17.769]  Think so?
[00:58:18.389 --> 00:58:25.915]  That's an Infowars.com article that Steve Watson wrote, but it links to the big NBC poll that shows that.
[00:58:26.975 --> 00:58:28.977]  You believe 20% aren't worried about nuclear war?
[00:58:28.997 --> 00:58:29.537]  They're idiots.
[00:58:30.818 --> 00:58:39.364]  Coming up, I'm going to show you the shocking video of Ukrainians shooting and torturing POWs and then calling their mothers up with their cell phones.
[00:58:40.882 --> 00:58:42.243]  To tell them they've killed their sons.
[00:58:42.283 --> 00:58:45.585]  And these are real soldiers that have been identified, even Ukrainian officers.
[00:58:46.206 --> 00:58:47.347]  It's all been confirmed.
[00:58:47.467 --> 00:58:51.570]  Ukrainian government came out last night and said, do not violate the Geneva Convention.
[00:58:51.590 --> 00:58:52.330]  They admit it's real.
[00:58:52.891 --> 00:58:54.432]  But our media is saying it's not, of course.
[00:58:54.792 --> 00:58:59.996]  Oh, but the killing the prisoners and torturing them, that's not real, even though it's on record.
[00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:06.140]  But Will Smith slapping Chris Rock, that was real, right?
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:06.721]  Uh-huh.
[00:59:07.768 --> 00:59:19.937]  I think we all agree that whether you're Mexican, or whether you're Russian, or whether you're Japanese, or Canadian, or American, or South African, that there's a war between countries that we shouldn't engage in war crimes.
[00:59:21.859 --> 00:59:32.527]  That means shooting prisoners, torturing prisoners, it means making people take injections, that's a war crime as well under the Nuremberg Code, Geneva Convention, the big farm has done to the American people, now coming after our newborn babies.
[00:59:36.015 --> 00:59:51.001]  When you see the footage coming out of Ukraine, most of the atrocities you're seeing, people targeting civilians, but also targeting military that have surrendered, is by the Ukrainians.
[00:59:53.042 --> 00:59:55.323]  And again, I know the demographics of Ukraine.
[00:59:55.503 --> 01:00:01.065]  I know that the main group fighting the Russians are Nazis, because their grandparents were.
[01:00:02.722 --> 01:00:08.605]  During World War II and after World War II, it took the Russians a year or more to clear them out of the country the first time.
[01:00:09.866 --> 01:00:10.827]  So that's just a fact.
[01:00:10.867 --> 01:00:14.128]  I mean, the left accuses a ham sandwich of being a Nazi.
[01:00:14.168 --> 01:00:16.230]  I mean, they'll accuse Martin Luther King of it.
[01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:18.731]  So it kind of loses its meaning.
[01:00:18.771 --> 01:00:21.853]  But this really is where the Nazis and the Russians were.
[01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:33.236]  You know, doing this to each other, and Ukraine was occupied by the Nazis for three years, and a lot of the Ukrainians were anti-Russian and pro-Nazi, because they saw the Nazis as liberators.
[01:00:34.337 --> 01:00:40.321]  A lot of Eastern European countries did, at first, and then they're like, oh, these guys are as bad or worse than the communists.
[01:00:41.081 --> 01:00:47.505]  And that's any mainline World War II history book, rise and fall of the Third Reich, Pulitzer Prize winning, explains all that in several chapters.
[01:00:47.525 --> 01:00:48.326]  This is not debated.
[01:00:49.397 --> 01:00:57.423]  So when they go, why, Zelensky's Jewish, there's no Nazis over there, it's playing on the ignorance of the public, okay?
[01:00:57.883 --> 01:01:00.105]  Zelensky's an actor, he's a front man.
[01:01:00.865 --> 01:01:05.769]  But one of the main groups empowering this civil war is the Nazis.
[01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:11.293]  So let's play a clip here from the end, and we got much more stuff than this, more graphic.
[01:01:11.353 --> 01:01:13.014]  I'm gonna show you just some of the least graphic stuff.
[01:01:14.034 --> 01:01:17.317]  Of them shooting people in the feet, knees, and genitals.
[01:01:19.121 --> 01:01:24.742]  And then we've got footage, I'm not going to show all of it, but where their genitals have been blown off and they're kicking them in the groin.
[01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:30.263]  And then they get their cell phones, these are well-known Ukrainians, and call their mommies.
[01:01:32.024 --> 01:01:33.664]  And make fun of them, and call their wives.
[01:01:36.044 --> 01:01:40.285]  And it's all real, it's been confirmed, this is really going on.
[01:01:40.485 --> 01:01:55.158]   So what type of whack jobs, and of course this guy turns out to be a Nazi, What type of whack job kills somebody, tortures them, commits a war crime, and then calls their mommy up when they capture their cell phone?
[01:01:55.418 --> 01:02:02.322]  Because remember, this would be like if Dallas invaded Waco, or if Dallas invaded Austin.
[01:02:02.842 --> 01:02:04.163]  It's the same people, same groups.
[01:02:04.483 --> 01:02:08.525]  These guys doing this speak perfect Russian, because they really are Russians.
[01:02:08.585 --> 01:02:09.466]  It's a Russian culture.
[01:02:09.506 --> 01:02:10.066]  It is Russian.
[01:02:10.286 --> 01:02:14.128]  It's got some Western European influences, but it's Russian.
[01:02:14.148 --> 01:02:14.909]  It's where Russians started.
[01:02:15.771 --> 01:02:22.738]  And so, they're doing all of this, and you're asking yourself, what type of whack jobs?
[01:02:22.758 --> 01:02:25.841]  Because I'm sure the Russians are probably doing atrocities, too.
[01:02:25.861 --> 01:02:26.602]  That happens in war.
[01:02:26.662 --> 01:02:27.303]  I'm not defending it.
[01:02:27.683 --> 01:02:30.806]  I mean, I bet they're shooting dudes in the ding dong, too.
[01:02:31.127 --> 01:02:31.947]  That kind of stuff goes on.
[01:02:33.388 --> 01:02:37.671]  Most of the troops don't do it, but there's always a certain percent in a war that do bad things.
[01:02:37.751 --> 01:02:41.134]  I bet Ukrainians are raping women, Russians are raping women.
[01:02:41.174 --> 01:02:42.155]  I mean, you know what's going on.
[01:02:42.495 --> 01:02:45.277]  The point is, why are they releasing it?
[01:02:45.978 --> 01:02:56.566]  Well, you had the head of the National Ambulance Group last Thursday put a video out on national TV saying, I have instructed them when we get injured Russians to castrate them.
[01:02:57.186 --> 01:03:01.452]   And then we have video of them blowing Move aside!
[01:03:01.472 --> 01:03:02.872]  Who are the officers?
[01:03:02.692 --> 01:03:06.590]   You're going to see some of the video. I'm not going to show the naked men and their
[01:03:06.590 --> 01:03:10.512]   genitals blown off, but I'm going to show you men writhing with blood pouring out of
[01:03:10.512 --> 01:03:15.731]   their crotch after they're shot. First, here's a video of them shooting men pulled off a
[01:03:15.731 --> 01:03:17.731]  truck in the legs.
[01:03:17.731 --> 01:03:35.731]  [Gunshots]
[01:03:35.731 --> 01:03:40.831]   Now, there's hours of these videos, okay, because on the Ukrainian sites, the Ukrainians
[01:03:40.831 --> 01:03:41.931]  are very proud of this.
[01:03:42.212 --> 01:03:46.097]  I don't even go to the Russian sites, I go to the Ukrainian sites and it's just, it's horrible.
[01:03:46.397 --> 01:03:48.479]  Let's play a short clip that isn't too graphic.
[01:03:48.499 --> 01:03:54.487]  This is one of the lighter clips of the same clip where it shows the man shot in the feet, knees and genitals.
[01:03:55.788 --> 01:04:02.535]  It's like some get shot in the penis, some get shot in the knee, and it seems like if you're more white, you get shot in the knee or the foot.
[01:04:02.555 --> 01:04:08.142]  I just noticed the browner Russians, because Russia's very diverse, they're getting shot in the wee-wee by the Nazis.
[01:04:08.402 --> 01:04:13.527]  And I'm not trying to make a joke of it or make light of it, I'm trying to have a lesser word for it, but in their genitals.
[01:04:13.847 --> 01:04:20.847]  Go ahead and roll it with audio, please, from the start.
[01:04:20.847 --> 01:04:28.847]  [Russian]
[01:04:28.847 --> 01:04:33.847]   The radio listeners are just mindling all over the place, inside a compound, on the ground outside.
[01:04:34.663 --> 01:04:40.907]  They take masks off of them, they're totally beat up, and then they scroll down and they've been shot in the genitals.
[01:04:41.447 --> 01:04:42.368]  This particular individual.
[01:04:43.927 --> 01:04:47.349]  Has had his genitals... This guy shot in the leg.
[01:04:47.369 --> 01:04:50.051]  There's another guy in a minute who shot the genitals.
[01:04:50.391 --> 01:04:52.533]  And you just look at it, there's just people lined up.
[01:04:52.713 --> 01:04:54.134]  Foot, knee, genital.
[01:04:54.194 --> 01:04:55.094]  Foot, knee, genital.
[01:04:56.995 --> 01:05:00.297]  Yeah, he shot in the thigh.
[01:05:00.137 --> 01:05:02.137]  Some of these guys are dead.
[01:05:02.137 --> 01:05:08.137]  But the dead are at peace.
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:08.202]  They're like, oh, he's dead.
[01:05:08.222 --> 01:05:08.983]  Let me move on over here.
[01:05:09.004 --> 01:05:10.447]  That guy's dead.
[01:05:10.467 --> 01:05:11.349]  A bunch of them are dead.
[01:05:11.369 --> 01:05:14.296]  And then they start, you know, shooting them more.
[01:05:14.336 --> 01:05:16.360]  But you'll see a guy here in a minute shot in the crotch.
[01:05:17.751 --> 01:05:20.414]  A couple more of them.
[01:05:20.594 --> 01:05:23.556]  Yeah, that guy's kneecapped.
[01:05:23.576 --> 01:05:29.161]  Yeah, this fella's shot in the genitals.
[01:05:29.862 --> 01:05:33.780]  [speaking in foreign language]
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:42.942]  Now this fellow shot in the genitals.
[01:05:42.942 --> 01:05:44.902]  There's a bunch of these.
[01:05:44.902 --> 01:05:50.662]   They take his mask off, you notice he's got, I notice all the guys shot in the genitals have brown skin.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.601]  That's what the Nazis did actually in World War II.
[01:05:52.921 --> 01:05:56.063]  He's a little bit browner, so he got a little... got his crotch blown out.
[01:05:57.768 --> 01:05:59.569]  Of course, this guy's dead.
[01:05:59.609 --> 01:06:01.650]  He got shot in the crotch, too.
[01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:04.852]  Oh, he's still alive.
[01:06:04.952 --> 01:06:07.333]  He's dead when they show him in it.
[01:06:07.413 --> 01:06:09.174]  I haven't watched this since last night.
[01:06:09.214 --> 01:06:10.555]  Let's go ahead and turn this off.
[01:06:10.435 --> 01:06:13.435]  [Background noise]
[01:06:13.435 --> 01:06:16.435]  Of course this guy's dead. He got shot in the crotch too.
[01:06:16.435 --> 01:06:20.435]  [Background noise]
[01:06:20.435 --> 01:06:22.435]   Oh he's still alive. There's a dead one they show in a minute.
[01:06:22.435 --> 01:06:24.435]  I haven't watched this since last night.
[01:06:24.435 --> 01:06:27.435]   Let's go ahead and turn this off. I don't want to watch this anymore.
[01:06:27.435 --> 01:06:31.435]   The point is, is that there's hours of this if you want to go look at it.
[01:06:31.527 --> 01:06:36.592]  And they're on TV saying, with a straight face, when we capture them, we cut their genitals off.
[01:06:36.772 --> 01:06:37.493]  We castrate them.
[01:06:38.614 --> 01:06:42.258]  And then they get them off the truck, shoot them in the foot, the knee, or in the waist.
[01:06:43.279 --> 01:06:44.140]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:06:45.299 --> 01:06:45.399]  Hello?
[01:06:45.219 --> 01:06:47.858]  And they're doing it not too scientifically either.
[01:06:47.858 --> 01:06:53.418]   So they're going to just shoot him in the torso, in the lower torso or in the abdomen area.
[01:06:53.418 --> 01:06:56.219]  So that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:56.219 --> 01:06:59.338]  And here, let's go out to break.
[01:06:59.338 --> 01:07:01.298]  There's so much cussing, even in English here.
[01:07:01.298 --> 01:07:02.798]  But here is the Ukrainian soldier--
[01:07:02.798 --> 01:07:04.818]  he's been identified, an officer--
[01:07:04.818 --> 01:07:07.938]   talking to one of the mothers on the cell phone he called, the guy he just killed.
[01:07:07.938 --> 01:07:08.438]  Here it is.
[01:07:08.438 --> 01:07:12.938]  [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
[01:07:12.938 --> 01:07:17.097]  [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[01:07:17.097 --> 01:07:18.938]  [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
[01:07:18.974 --> 01:07:20.515]  Look, it's Ilyushin.
[01:07:22.176 --> 01:07:23.257]  Glory to Ukraine!
[01:07:23.697 --> 01:07:25.919]  Ilyushin is no more.
[01:07:25.979 --> 01:07:27.440]  He got sick and died.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.260]  That's it.
[01:07:28.981 --> 01:07:29.801]  No, Ilyushin.
[01:07:29.881 --> 01:07:30.622]  He got lost.
[01:07:30.962 --> 01:07:32.783]  That was his first mistake.
[01:07:33.344 --> 01:07:35.145]  The second one was he got lost in Ukraine.
[01:07:35.485 --> 01:07:39.728]  And the third and the last one was he died, bitch.
[01:07:40.588 --> 01:07:43.230]  Hello?
[01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:45.171]  Has the Internet been disconnected?
[01:07:45.312 --> 01:07:47.312]  Russians!
[01:07:47.312 --> 01:07:51.312]  Why are you smacking the lady's lips?
[01:07:51.312 --> 01:07:57.312]  Do you see that this is a fucking dish?
[01:07:57.312 --> 01:07:58.312]  No.
[01:07:58.312 --> 01:08:00.312]  Yes, I see. What is written there?
[01:08:00.312 --> 01:08:03.312]  No, this is some kind of dish.
[01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:06.312]  Why is he showing his ass?
[01:08:06.312 --> 01:08:09.312]  Show your body, go!
[01:08:09.312 --> 01:08:12.312]  So he left, fuck, one ass torn off.
[01:08:13.078 --> 01:08:14.519]  What do you want me to show you?
[01:08:14.859 --> 01:08:15.499]  A phone, thank God.
[01:08:15.539 --> 01:08:19.241]  They saved you from being called and told that there's no more half-poker.
[01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:19.922]  Fucking moron.
[01:08:19.942 --> 01:08:24.784]  You have an ass instead of a head?
[01:08:24.804 --> 01:08:27.706]  No, now your guy has an ass instead of a head, as you say.
[01:08:27.806 --> 01:08:31.128]  And where there's an ass, there's a head or something left of it.
[01:08:31.148 --> 01:08:34.390]  Glory to the Ukrainian artillery!
[01:08:36.962 --> 01:08:40.462]  So what to show him? His dogs will eat him and that's it.
[01:08:40.462 --> 01:08:44.462]  My mom's dogs will eat him, brother.
[01:08:44.462 --> 01:08:46.462]  Dogs will eat him, we don't even bury them.
[01:08:46.462 --> 01:08:50.462]   There is no time to bury them, because they are so f*cking full.
[01:08:50.462 --> 01:08:53.462]  There are pieces of him, there is a leg, there is a head.
[01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:56.462]  The phone fell out along with the torn jacket.
[01:08:56.462 --> 01:08:58.462]  And that's it, so I stayed.
[01:08:58.962 --> 01:09:00.962]  (Laughter)
[01:09:00.962 --> 01:09:05.962]  This whole situation in Russia is extremely complex.
[01:09:05.962 --> 01:09:11.962]   But there is an issue at the center of this that is just so bizarre.
[01:09:11.962 --> 01:09:13.702]  are.
[01:09:13.652 --> 01:09:26.823]  And it's that you can quote what the State Department says when they get something right, sometimes they actually tell the truth, and then you'll get attacked by the New York Times, the Washington Post, Media Matters, as being a horrible person.
[01:09:28.945 --> 01:09:31.107]  But you just quoted what they said and agreed with it.
[01:09:31.607 --> 01:09:37.278]   They don't even want the general public or other talk show hosts To even be involved in policy discussions.
[01:09:37.318 --> 01:09:39.318]  They want you to, hey, go watch your Netflix over there.
[01:09:39.538 --> 01:09:41.279]  And I'll play a clip of this, illustrate this in a moment.
[01:09:41.299 --> 01:09:44.679]  But Biden came out a week and a half ago and said the New World Order is in trouble.
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:49.601]  Their global system's in trouble because of Putin's invasion.
[01:09:50.201 --> 01:09:52.982]  In 2017, he said the same thing.
[01:09:53.202 --> 01:09:58.523]  And it's actually true that China and Russia are challenging the Anglo-American New World Order.
[01:10:03.168 --> 01:10:04.768]  General Flynn comes out last week.
[01:10:04.808 --> 01:10:05.729]  It was all over the news.
[01:10:05.749 --> 01:10:12.611]  They demonized him as a Russian agent because he quoted that the Western New World Order is being threatened by Putin.
[01:10:12.991 --> 01:10:16.712]  I mean, it's like saying Santa Claus wears a red and white outfit.
[01:10:16.752 --> 01:10:21.514]  I mean, it's or I mean, the First Amendment's about freedom of speech.
[01:10:21.614 --> 01:10:24.855]  I mean, it's just next level, folks.
[01:10:26.475 --> 01:10:27.155]  It's next level.
[01:10:29.516 --> 01:10:32.717]  That they're all saying this is overthrowing their order.
[01:10:34.013 --> 01:10:37.757]  And then he says it, and he's bad when he's the former head of Defense Intelligence.
[01:10:37.797 --> 01:10:47.026]  And I don't even know, at this level, the propaganda they operate on, except their average minion is so stupid, they don't know how stupid that makes them sound.
[01:10:47.346 --> 01:10:52.351]  I don't want to fight with Blinken, or Garland, or any of these people.
[01:10:52.652 --> 01:10:55.575]  I want them to stop being such horrible people.
[01:10:57.185 --> 01:10:58.926]  I want America to be the good guys!
[01:10:59.346 --> 01:11:04.648]  God, I know we were never perfect, but we were the good guys compared to other people, and we're not now, and I don't like that.
[01:11:06.088 --> 01:11:12.951]  We're the leader in lies, the leader in BS, and the leader in pedophilia, and a bunch of other bad stuff, and I'm tired of it!
[01:11:13.731 --> 01:11:15.252]  I'm tired of you wrecking this country!
[01:11:15.272 --> 01:11:22.355]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls after I play these clips.
[01:11:23.686 --> 01:11:24.807]  I appreciate everybody calling in today.
[01:11:24.887 --> 01:11:26.529]  I just start getting so pissed at these people.
[01:11:26.789 --> 01:11:30.052]  Because, you know, these globalists going along with this, they're destroying their own future.
[01:11:30.092 --> 01:11:32.334]  But they've got to dominate everybody.
[01:11:32.535 --> 01:11:33.395]  And I'll get to it next hour.
[01:11:33.415 --> 01:11:37.239]  I got all this Black Rock news I said I'd get to this hour, but I got to go to your calls.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.723]  But since I mentioned this, let's go to the Sean Hannity clip.
[01:11:41.003 --> 01:11:43.005]  And again, I'm not in competition with Sean Hannity.
[01:11:43.125 --> 01:11:44.506]  I like Sean most of the time.
[01:11:44.807 --> 01:11:46.008]  I don't want to be his enemy.
[01:11:46.628 --> 01:11:56.693]   But, you know, You can't sit there and say, we need to go ahead and have a nuclear war, and we can't have nukes off the table, we can't cower in fear.
[01:11:59.855 --> 01:12:04.257]  After he says he wants to bomb the Russian convoy, which would start a major expanded war.
[01:12:05.237 --> 01:12:12.020]  I mean, Sean, let's fix America's problems first, and stop letting George Soros start a war over there.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.801]  Is what the Russians doing the best idea?
[01:12:14.841 --> 01:12:15.441]  Do we agree with it?
[01:12:15.641 --> 01:12:16.242]  I don't agree with it.
[01:12:16.502 --> 01:12:16.722]  Sean?
[01:12:18.271 --> 01:12:24.753]  But I know why they did it, and I know that the globalists, our mutual enemy, are the ones that started the fight.
[01:12:25.633 --> 01:12:27.774]  Do I like the bear running around rampaging now?
[01:12:27.894 --> 01:12:28.154]  No!
[01:12:30.715 --> 01:12:35.157]  But we shouldn't have gone in there and done that, and we did, so let's not escalate that now.
[01:12:35.357 --> 01:12:36.037]  Here's Sean Hannity.
[01:12:37.003 --> 01:12:40.525]  If Vladimir Putin wanted to negotiate, he would have done it a long time ago.
[01:12:40.925 --> 01:12:41.806]  He's not willing to.
[01:12:42.967 --> 01:12:51.392]  And if he wants to use chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, he's got to know that his entire country is going to be blown off the face of the earth.
[01:12:51.732 --> 01:12:53.773]  I pray to God we never get to that point.
[01:12:54.494 --> 01:12:56.175]  But that's always been a threat.
[01:12:56.895 --> 01:12:58.216]  And it remains a threat here.
[01:12:58.556 --> 01:13:04.460]  And we can't cower in fear based on the fact that we've had mutually assured destruction pretty much for a lifetime.
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.381]  But I appreciate you being on.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:09.440]  Let me explain something to Sean Hannity.
[01:13:12.101 --> 01:13:16.602]  Putin has zero motive to use chemical or biological or nuclear weapons.
[01:13:16.962 --> 01:13:18.502]  It would turn him into Hitler.
[01:13:20.102 --> 01:13:26.263]  I mean, if they could prove he preemptively uses a nuclear weapon, or chemical or biological, I'll say kill him.
[01:13:26.984 --> 01:13:29.784]  I mean, kill Vladimir Putin!
[01:13:29.804 --> 01:13:30.164]  Kill him!
[01:13:30.624 --> 01:13:31.244]  If he does that.
[01:13:31.764 --> 01:13:34.185]  And I'd say the same thing about any other world leader.
[01:13:35.546 --> 01:13:40.811]  If I thought Joe Biden was going to launch a preemptive strike on Russia with nuclear weapons, I'm not going to kill him.
[01:13:40.991 --> 01:13:41.832]  I'm not threatening him.
[01:13:41.852 --> 01:13:46.436]  And this is hypothetical, but yeah, lock his ass up and put him in a padded room.
[01:13:50.179 --> 01:13:51.160]  He's already there anyways.
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:58.827]  I mean, that's not the UN and others got caught staging attacks and blaming it on Assad on record.
[01:14:00.302 --> 01:14:02.764]  We invaded Iraq repeatedly over WMDs.
[01:14:02.864 --> 01:14:04.045]  It was exaggerated.
[01:14:04.326 --> 01:14:05.387]  It was BS.
[01:14:07.369 --> 01:14:08.970]  There wasn't anthrax in that vial.
[01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:10.291]  They didn't have anthrax trucks.
[01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:11.472]  That was made up.
[01:14:11.712 --> 01:14:16.477]  Then they injected our troops with a bunch of poison frickin' vaccine for a threat that didn't even exist!
[01:14:19.099 --> 01:14:20.701]  And then we got Sean Hannity up there.
[01:14:22.588 --> 01:14:24.710]  You know, we can't take nukes off the table.
[01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:25.210]  We can't.
[01:14:25.591 --> 01:14:26.291]  Coward fear.
[01:14:26.651 --> 01:14:28.733]  And you got Biden saying, we may use nukes first.
[01:14:29.014 --> 01:14:30.535]  We may kill Putin.
[01:14:30.815 --> 01:14:32.056]  You assholes.
[01:14:32.136 --> 01:14:32.837]  Excuse my French.
[01:14:36.035 --> 01:14:36.816]  Because that's not enough.
[01:14:37.216 --> 01:14:49.083]  You fucking assholes need to stop trying to destroy the planet and knock it the hell off while you're trying to impress other men around you that you waddle around talking about let's use nuclear weapons.
[01:14:49.724 --> 01:14:51.185]  How about let's use our brains?
[01:14:51.605 --> 01:14:52.305]  How about that?
[01:14:52.686 --> 01:14:54.527]  How about we use that sometime, huh?
[01:14:57.226 --> 01:15:00.588]  99% of these guys run their mouth about war and how tough they are.
[01:15:00.868 --> 01:15:04.509]  Let me tell you, you get in a ring with them bare knuckle, they're gonna start crying for their mommy.
[01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:10.892]  And I'm not saying I'm gonna beat his ass, I'm telling him, stop trying to start a nuclear war!
[01:15:15.654 --> 01:15:18.696]  Let's play a real hero, war hero, a real patriot, General Flynn.
[01:15:19.974 --> 01:15:21.575]  Europe has seen the same kind of attacks in the past.
[01:15:21.395 --> 01:15:24.395]   himself and gotten highly awarded for him and a great American patriot.
[01:15:24.395 --> 01:15:25.555]  Let's play what he said.
[01:15:25.555 --> 01:15:29.955]   But first, let's hear what Biden said five years ago in 2017.
[01:15:29.955 --> 01:15:31.435]  And he said it again last week.
[01:15:31.435 --> 01:15:35.115]  And all Flynn did was agree.
[01:15:35.115 --> 01:15:36.875]  And he's a Russian agent now.
[01:15:36.875 --> 01:15:38.515]  What fruitcake world is that?
[01:15:38.515 --> 01:15:40.274]  Play the clips back to back.
[01:15:40.274 --> 01:15:42.555]  Europe has seen the same kind of attacks in the past.
[01:15:42.555 --> 01:15:47.555]   With many countries in Europe slated to hold elections this year,
[01:15:47.555 --> 01:15:51.515]   We should expect further attempts by Russia to meddle in the democratic process.
[01:15:51.501 --> 01:15:53.222]  It will occur again, I promise you.
[01:15:54.803 --> 01:15:56.365]  And again, the purpose is clear.
[01:15:57.346 --> 01:15:59.848]  To collapse the liberal international order.
[01:16:00.769 --> 01:16:02.710]  And now's the time when things are shifting.
[01:16:02.730 --> 01:16:05.273]  There's going to be a new world order out there.
[01:16:05.833 --> 01:16:06.794]  And we've got to lead it.
[01:16:06.967 --> 01:16:09.728]   and we've got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.
[01:16:09.728 --> 01:16:14.927]   Someone like Vladimir Putin has now upset this balance of the New World Order
[01:16:14.927 --> 01:16:18.327]  that they were trying to achieve by going into Ukraine.
[01:16:18.327 --> 01:16:23.927]   And, you know, I'm probably the last person that's going to be a Putin apologist.
[01:16:23.927 --> 01:16:25.608]  I won't be.
[01:16:25.608 --> 01:16:32.047]   But what I do understand are the dynamics that are playing out in Ukraine right now.
[01:16:32.047 --> 01:16:36.806]   And I sent you something earlier, Clay, and we don't need to go into the details of it,
[01:16:36.806 --> 01:16:45.738]   but all of what we are seeing play out in Europe right now is an upsetting of the balance of the world order as they
[01:16:45.738 --> 01:16:50.177]   want it, as people like Dr. Harari, as people like Klaus Schwab and
[01:16:50.177 --> 01:16:50.686]  others.
[01:16:50.733 --> 01:16:51.954]  Bill Gates is another one.
[01:16:52.434 --> 01:17:04.038]  So we have to understand that these are people that are very smart, they're very well resourced, and they have a very sort of strategic idea of how they want to see the world develop.
[01:17:04.819 --> 01:17:12.424]   And God And a soul are not part of that strategy.
[01:17:13.685 --> 01:17:14.946]  That's right, because they're going to be your soul.
[01:17:14.966 --> 01:17:15.766]  They're going to program you.
[01:17:15.786 --> 01:17:19.409]  So his crime wasn't agreeing that the New World Order has been upset.
[01:17:19.509 --> 01:17:20.129]  That's a fact.
[01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:22.631]  The headlines are like, preposterous, the New World Order has been upset.
[01:17:22.931 --> 01:17:27.395]  It was pointing out that the people running this New World Order are not Americans and don't like us.
[01:17:28.325 --> 01:17:36.107]  Does that mean Putin's pervert and we should go skip along with him through the, you know, glades and little flowers and play patty cake?
[01:17:36.147 --> 01:17:40.548]  No, it just means Putin isn't the one deploding our borders having drag queen story time.
[01:17:40.828 --> 01:17:42.348]  Putin's not the one shipping fentanyl in here.
[01:17:42.848 --> 01:17:44.288]  Putin's not the one devaluing our dollar.
[01:17:45.089 --> 01:17:47.229]  Putin's not the one shutting down the Keystone Pipeline.
[01:17:47.789 --> 01:17:49.209]  Putin's not the one trying to take your guns.
[01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:51.310]  No, it's the New World Order.
[01:17:51.330 --> 01:17:51.790]  We'll be right back.
[01:17:53.618 --> 01:18:01.305]  It is such an incredible time to be alive, and I am so honored to be with you all here on air today as we come together for liberty and freedom.
[01:18:02.046 --> 01:18:06.671]  Cabot and South Dakota, your call is coming up here in just a moment, and so many others.
[01:18:06.771 --> 01:18:08.052]  I'm going to go right through your calls.
[01:18:08.132 --> 01:18:08.993]  Bam, bam, bam.
[01:18:09.433 --> 01:18:10.074]  Toll-free number.
[01:18:09.913 --> 01:18:17.113]   as soon as you hear somebody hang up you can call in 877-789-2539 or 877-789-ALEX.
[01:18:17.113 --> 01:18:22.713]   Very briefly, Infowars is barely making its payroll right now.
[01:18:22.876 --> 01:18:23.776]  I'm not complaining or bitching.
[01:18:23.816 --> 01:18:24.936]  It's all up to God and all up to you.
[01:18:24.956 --> 01:18:28.957]  We have to pay for our own bandwidth, our own satellites, our own legal, our own infrastructure.
[01:18:28.977 --> 01:18:31.958]  We have the full weight of the New World Order against us trying to shut us down.
[01:18:31.978 --> 01:18:33.418]  They're hopping mad we're still on air.
[01:18:33.838 --> 01:18:37.899]  We can stay on air for a long time to come thanks to you and what you're doing.
[01:18:37.959 --> 01:18:44.540]  But I just need you to go to InfoWarsStore.com and get great supplements and films and books and t-shirts.
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:46.220]  And so much more.
[01:18:46.781 --> 01:18:50.202]  But we've got a special offering at 1776coin.com.
[01:18:50.662 --> 01:18:52.983]  There's also a link to get it at InfowarStore.com.
[01:18:53.823 --> 01:18:57.925]  And that is the second in the three-part series of the founding member.
[01:18:58.925 --> 01:19:01.266]  And if there's a nuclear war, you won't get anything special.
[01:19:01.326 --> 01:19:04.027]  Or if I get assassinated, you probably won't ever get the special thing.
[01:19:04.067 --> 01:19:10.069]  But we're developing a bunch of stuff exclusively that'll be free, that I'll send links to everybody.
[01:19:11.021 --> 01:19:13.522]  That gives us their email when they buy the coin.
[01:19:13.543 --> 01:19:17.125]  If you want to just anonymously buy the coins, it's collectible and really cool, and I designed it.
[01:19:18.065 --> 01:19:18.806]  You want to keep us on air?
[01:19:18.826 --> 01:19:19.266]  That's great.
[01:19:19.306 --> 01:19:31.413]  But when you check out at 1776coin.com, at patriotcollectibles.com, you can link through also at infowarshore.com, you are literally funding the second American Revolution worldwide.
[01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:32.514]  1776 worldwide.
[01:19:33.054 --> 01:19:46.658]   It is available right now, and it is It's limited edition and it's got a markup there that's reasonable to help us found new systems and stay on air and build very exclusive things for the people that become founding members.
[01:19:46.698 --> 01:19:47.478]  So this is a big deal.
[01:19:47.858 --> 01:19:48.799]  Only three coins.
[01:19:48.839 --> 01:19:49.759]  This is the second coin.
[01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:56.000]  It's the Tree of Liberty with the Thomas Jefferson quote, the Tree of Liberty must be water from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:57.801]  That is on the coin.
[01:19:58.701 --> 01:20:02.703]  It is extremely powerful in my view, and of the three coins, they're all excellent.
[01:20:03.104 --> 01:20:06.946]  This one is my favorite, though I designed all three.
[01:20:07.406 --> 01:20:08.767]  The others are close.
[01:20:09.827 --> 01:20:12.009]  I'll just tell you, I think the next coin's great.
[01:20:12.069 --> 01:20:14.610]  I'm not going to tell you what it is yet, but it's excellent.
[01:20:15.370 --> 01:20:16.451]  The first one was amazing.
[01:20:16.651 --> 01:20:18.312]  This one is the best, in my view.
[01:20:18.892 --> 01:20:21.274]  And it's available exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:23.612]  And thank you for coming through, folks.
[01:20:24.173 --> 01:20:28.759]  We've already sold out of 10% of the coins since the show started.
[01:20:29.668 --> 01:20:33.831]  And so at current rates, we'll end up selling out of this in a week or so, like we did last time.
[01:20:33.851 --> 01:20:36.592]  It took 10 days last time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:20:36.612 --> 01:20:39.514]  So if you want part two in the series, it is available.
[01:20:39.794 --> 01:20:44.297]  And we held back, by the way, 300 of the original George Washington's Slay the Dragon coin.
[01:20:44.877 --> 01:20:53.022]  Those will be randomly 50 a day, the next four days, released on the site at different times of the day.
[01:20:53.042 --> 01:20:53.803]  In fact, I'm doing it now.
[01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:56.484]  They were telling me about this, but they don't want me to jump on them.
[01:20:56.884 --> 01:20:59.584]  I'm going to ask during the break when we're allowed to do it, but they got to like go in and add it.
[01:20:59.624 --> 01:21:05.346]  But sometime today, 50 of those coins that are already sold out will be available on the side as well.
[01:21:05.366 --> 01:21:11.007]  I want to thank you all for your support and keeping us on air at 1776coin.com.
[01:21:11.407 --> 01:21:11.727]  Okay.
[01:21:13.728 --> 01:21:17.529]  Let's go to your phone calls and let's try to get to as many of them as possible.
[01:21:18.069 --> 01:21:20.330]  Let's go to Kevin in South Dakota.
[01:21:20.650 --> 01:21:21.630]  Thank you for calling today.
[01:21:21.670 --> 01:21:21.970]  Welcome.
[01:21:23.191 --> 01:21:24.112]  What's up, Buttercup?
[01:21:24.172 --> 01:21:24.773]  How you doing?
[01:21:24.813 --> 01:21:25.473]  I love what you do.
[01:21:25.513 --> 01:21:25.974]  I love you.
[01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:26.775]  You rock it.
[01:21:27.475 --> 01:21:28.656]  And I have three things to say.
[01:21:28.697 --> 01:21:31.199]  I'm going to try and be quick so that other people can get on the line.
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:36.144]  First off, I don't watch TV because I have a soul.
[01:21:36.584 --> 01:21:40.809]  However, I do have the Internet and I saw what happened at the Oscars.
[01:21:40.849 --> 01:21:44.452]  And I got to say, this black on black violence is getting out of hand.
[01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:45.794]  Pun intended.
[01:21:46.654 --> 01:21:47.855]  I gotta say, it's ridiculous.
[01:21:47.895 --> 01:21:49.315]  But, I know about theater.
[01:21:49.335 --> 01:21:50.376]  Well, let me ask you this question.
[01:21:50.396 --> 01:21:51.196]  I mean, do you agree with me?
[01:21:51.216 --> 01:21:51.977]  If you disagree, it's fine.
[01:21:52.457 --> 01:21:53.937]  There's a consensus in the office.
[01:21:53.957 --> 01:21:55.078]  This was as fake as hell.
[01:21:55.858 --> 01:21:56.158]  Yes!
[01:21:56.378 --> 01:21:57.359]  I got a degree in theater.
[01:21:57.399 --> 01:22:01.101]  What you said about the foot hitting the floor, and I'm not one of these fruitcakes in theater.
[01:22:01.141 --> 01:22:01.841]  I'm a conservative.
[01:22:01.881 --> 01:22:02.701]  That's a whole nother story.
[01:22:02.721 --> 01:22:03.782]  Hey, Rob, Bill has a theater degree.
[01:22:03.842 --> 01:22:04.242]  I love him.
[01:22:04.262 --> 01:22:05.202]  Nothing wrong with the theater.
[01:22:05.222 --> 01:22:06.503]  What's wrong is the commies running it.
[01:22:07.409 --> 01:22:09.090]  That's right, the stinking Marxist.
[01:22:09.170 --> 01:22:13.311]  I don't want to get off on that, Rabbitry Leader, but that foot hitting the ground is a total tell.
[01:22:13.611 --> 01:22:15.352]  Also, Will Smith is 6.2.
[01:22:15.972 --> 01:22:20.334]  If he can't knock out crackhead Chris Rock with a slap, he doesn't know.
[01:22:21.074 --> 01:22:23.655]  That means that his wife should leave him because he's a weenie.
[01:22:24.055 --> 01:22:30.058]  I mean, if you walk all the way to that stage with that momentum and you can't knock a crackhead down, can you fight?
[01:22:30.538 --> 01:22:30.678]  No.
[01:22:32.018 --> 01:22:33.299]  We all know body language.
[01:22:33.379 --> 01:22:34.819]  It was as fake as a $3 bill.
[01:22:34.839 --> 01:22:35.520]  They're dying.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:36.740]  Their ratings are dying.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:38.101]  This was a stinking stunt.
[01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:40.542]  I mean, the walking off is so fake, too.
[01:22:41.602 --> 01:22:45.444]  And the way Chris Rock sticks his chin out when he's walking up getting ready.
[01:22:45.504 --> 01:22:46.284]  I mean, come on, man.
[01:22:47.168 --> 01:22:47.909]  You're not going to believe it.
[01:22:47.929 --> 01:22:48.870]  I'm a stand-up comedian.
[01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.051]  I like both of those guys.
[01:22:50.171 --> 01:22:51.032]  I don't like what they did.
[01:22:51.072 --> 01:22:51.613]  They know better.
[01:22:51.873 --> 01:22:55.718]  Will Smith, Chris Rock, you need to be ashamed and you need to expose this because you're better than that.
[01:22:55.738 --> 01:22:56.458]  But no, they're not.
[01:22:56.498 --> 01:22:57.159]  They're in the system.
[01:22:57.179 --> 01:22:58.881]  Yeah, I mean, I like Will Smith as an actor.
[01:22:59.001 --> 01:23:00.984]  You know, Chris Rock's always pushing his Levis agenda.
[01:23:01.004 --> 01:23:02.786]  But yeah, look, this was a stunt.
[01:23:02.906 --> 01:23:03.446]  It was fake.
[01:23:03.827 --> 01:23:05.469]  And we need to be able to talk about false flags.
[01:23:05.509 --> 01:23:08.031]  But oh, you're not supposed to question Jussie Smollett.
[01:23:08.632 --> 01:23:12.920]  You're not supposed to question Gulf of Tonkin, you're not supposed to... No, no, no.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:16.888]  We're gonna question it, and they don't want us questioning it.
[01:23:16.928 --> 01:23:18.370]  What's your view on the gender madness?
[01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:19.011]  You wanted to get to that.
[01:23:19.927 --> 01:23:20.607]  Yes, yes.
[01:23:20.667 --> 01:23:21.968]  Well, it relates to the Russian issue.
[01:23:21.988 --> 01:23:26.330]  The Russians feel they have to preserve the world from the gender madness like we felt we had to stop the communists.
[01:23:26.370 --> 01:23:33.332]  By the way, Putin actually recognizes it as a fundamental attack on the family and destruction of civilization because their family was already collapsing.
[01:23:33.592 --> 01:23:35.493]  He understands this is a biomedical tyranny.
[01:23:35.733 --> 01:23:36.754]  He came out about J.K.
[01:23:36.814 --> 01:23:42.316]  Rowling and said they've banned her because she says biological women have rights.
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:50.242]  Yeah, they have taken a rip from the insanity bong and they ghosted that son of a gun, but here's the deal.
[01:23:51.062 --> 01:23:53.363]  In Wyoming, there is a deal.
[01:23:53.563 --> 01:24:05.527]  Russia sold their shares in a uranium company right before the war broke out, and I think the people who bought those knew what was going to happen, because you were talking about Jackson Hole people, billionaires, determining the whole COVID-19 thing in advance.
[01:24:05.867 --> 01:24:11.548]  But where I'm from, Powder River, the Powder River Basin has core to its area, Campbell County.
[01:24:11.888 --> 01:24:12.529]  That's my home.
[01:24:12.729 --> 01:24:13.349]  That's where I'm from.
[01:24:13.809 --> 01:24:16.611]  And in Campbell County right now the libraries are pushing the gay agenda.
[01:24:16.811 --> 01:24:20.253]  We've been fighting it for over, well not over a year, since July of last year.
[01:24:20.373 --> 01:24:23.795]  Let's be clear, they're pushing a pedo agenda of sexualizing children.
[01:24:24.115 --> 01:24:25.656]  Don't even give them that gay thing.
[01:24:25.696 --> 01:24:27.397]  They're pushing a pedo agenda.
[01:24:28.379 --> 01:24:29.639]  You're right, I was talking fast.
[01:24:29.699 --> 01:24:36.620]  In fact, I was appealing before the library board for a book called Sex Plus by Lacey Green, which isn't even a gay book.
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:41.261]  It's a book aimed at 16-year-olds trying to encourage them to try BDSM and electrocute their nipples.
[01:24:41.601 --> 01:24:42.641]  Yeah, all of it's bad.
[01:24:42.761 --> 01:24:43.422]  All of it's bad.
[01:24:43.482 --> 01:24:50.163]  You should not be bombarding young people and elementary students with how to shove things in their rear end.
[01:24:50.223 --> 01:24:52.943]  It's criminal, it's pedophilia, it's grooming children.
[01:24:52.963 --> 01:24:53.983]  These people need to go to prison.
[01:24:54.023 --> 01:24:54.643]  Thank you for the call.
[01:24:55.364 --> 01:24:56.524]  Alright, next up.
[01:24:56.544 --> 01:24:57.484]  Who was next up here?
[01:25:00.623 --> 01:25:14.306]  I'm good Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:25:14.406 --> 01:25:23.568]  I just wanted to comment on the Will Smith incident last night and how it is pharmakeia or a form of lesser magic.
[01:25:24.488 --> 01:25:33.807]   He was laughing at the jokes beforehand to let everyone know what he was doing. He was going along with the joke. It was
[01:25:33.807 --> 01:25:40.288]   staged. And then he goes goes on and does this and the world is in bewilderment as
[01:25:40.288 --> 01:25:47.457]   if they're under a spell. That's right and part of a virus of the mind, old
[01:25:47.457 --> 01:25:53.057]   term is spell, is that your subconscious knows it's a lie but when you don't say
[01:25:53.057 --> 01:25:57.378]   it's a lie, don't realize it's a lie consciously, now you open yourself up
[01:25:57.378 --> 01:25:59.448]  for programming.
[01:25:57.382 --> 01:25:58.823]  And that's why Lesser Magic is.
[01:25:59.263 --> 01:26:06.887]  They have to tell you what they're about to do before they do it, and they believe that gives them power over you, because when you accept a lie, you have now joined them.
[01:26:08.888 --> 01:26:09.289]  Exactly.
[01:26:09.789 --> 01:26:14.751]  And it's actually what you mentioned in recent words as far as the psychological control grid.
[01:26:15.372 --> 01:26:18.413]  And I just got to make a quick point about the iodine.
[01:26:18.654 --> 01:26:19.294]  It's excellent.
[01:26:19.915 --> 01:26:26.185]  I did not realize how docile I was until I started taking it for a month and then I was pissed off again.
[01:26:26.746 --> 01:26:33.417]  So seriously, if you guys listen to this man's show and do not support him, that he puts it on here for free, what are you doing?
[01:26:34.056 --> 01:26:34.876]  I bought the coin.
[01:26:35.216 --> 01:26:37.717]  I support you with the supplements, however I can.
[01:26:37.897 --> 01:26:40.058]  I don't make a lot of money, but I do it where I can.
[01:26:40.078 --> 01:26:41.198]  I put my money where my mouth is.
[01:26:41.798 --> 01:26:42.459]  So, thank you.
[01:26:42.559 --> 01:26:43.419]  Well, thank you, Victor.
[01:26:43.439 --> 01:26:44.199]  I want to salute Victor.
[01:26:44.219 --> 01:26:45.259]  I want to explain something.
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:47.440]  Nobody's making anybody buy things here.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:53.002]  And if I had some billionaire donor, you know, that gave me $25 million a year, that's what it takes to run this place.
[01:26:53.842 --> 01:26:55.802]  I mean, small newspapers cost more than that, folks.
[01:26:55.822 --> 01:26:57.523]  It sounds like a lot of money ain't worth what it used to be.
[01:26:57.963 --> 01:27:02.285]   If I had some donor gave me $25 million a year, We would not run any ads here.
[01:27:02.525 --> 01:27:05.246]  Now, our local radio stations and TV, they get ads.
[01:27:05.266 --> 01:27:08.388]  They're going to run them still, but I mean, please make the donation now!
[01:27:09.629 --> 01:27:10.969]  I will go commercial-free.
[01:27:11.069 --> 01:27:13.511]  Local stations will still want their 6, 7, 8 minutes an hour.
[01:27:14.471 --> 01:27:16.833]  That's why we have another 6, 7 minutes for us, because that's for the network.
[01:27:17.153 --> 01:27:18.634]  But I would end ads now.
[01:27:18.674 --> 01:27:25.257]  I'm still on the old model, which is great, because when they tried to de-platform us on the Internet, we still had 180 affiliates at that time.
[01:27:27.831 --> 01:27:30.594]  It's like 370 right now on AM and FM.
[01:27:31.976 --> 01:27:33.438]  All the censorship didn't go too well.
[01:27:33.598 --> 01:27:41.247]  Hundreds of cable and TV stations enraging the left that they can't even figure out where they are or try to do anything because we're free to air.
[01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:49.133]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's just amazing that fellows like that and all of you keep us on air.
[01:27:49.173 --> 01:27:50.614]  So great job.
[01:27:50.674 --> 01:27:52.675]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:27:52.534 --> 01:27:57.814]   We are having such a massive effect right now, and I just want to thank you all for what you've done,
[01:27:57.814 --> 01:27:59.713]  because you did this.
[01:27:59.713 --> 01:28:08.453]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[01:28:08.503 --> 01:28:11.404]  I need your help keeping InfoWars on the air and strong.
[01:28:11.944 --> 01:28:15.045]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[01:28:15.946 --> 01:28:16.806]  I was born for this.
[01:28:16.966 --> 01:28:17.826]  You were born for this.
[01:28:17.966 --> 01:28:20.467]  And people are really waking up right now.
[01:28:20.527 --> 01:28:27.010]  But we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:38.553]  With Bandot Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[01:28:38.673 --> 01:28:41.873]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[01:28:41.893 --> 01:28:49.135]  InfoWars and Bandot Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[01:28:49.535 --> 01:28:56.017]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[01:28:56.937 --> 01:28:59.219]  The biggest sale in InfoWars history is going right now.
[01:28:59.279 --> 01:29:00.921]  The Mega Emergency Blowout Sale.
[01:29:01.161 --> 01:29:02.382]  Up to 75% off.
[01:29:02.422 --> 01:29:05.504]  Get incredible products and keep InfoWars as strong as ever.
[01:29:06.225 --> 01:29:07.186]  Let's go to Oregon.
[01:29:08.167 --> 01:29:10.068]  Let's talk to Bob in Oregon.
[01:29:10.849 --> 01:29:11.750]  Bob, thanks for calling.
[01:29:11.770 --> 01:29:12.270]  You're on the air.
[01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:12.611]  Welcome.
[01:29:13.251 --> 01:29:14.372]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:29:14.552 --> 01:29:15.093]  I'm alright, brother.
[01:29:15.953 --> 01:29:16.514]  Fantastic.
[01:29:16.554 --> 01:29:19.737]  Hey, I've been listening to you for 26 and a half years, my friend.
[01:29:20.918 --> 01:29:21.238]  Wow.
[01:29:21.258 --> 01:29:22.199]  How did you first tune in?
[01:29:24.226 --> 01:29:26.146]  How did I first tune in?
[01:29:26.186 --> 01:29:28.267]  You were doing a podcast with somebody.
[01:29:30.287 --> 01:29:31.507]  I can't really remember who it was.
[01:29:31.527 --> 01:29:32.448]  That's a long time ago.
[01:29:32.608 --> 01:29:34.988]  Yeah, it was a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
[01:29:35.008 --> 01:29:36.448]  Well, what's on your mind, brother?
[01:29:36.888 --> 01:29:37.949]  And I see where you are today.
[01:29:37.969 --> 01:29:39.589]  Oh, my hat goes off to you.
[01:29:40.029 --> 01:29:41.069]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:43.970]  I mean, you're in my prayers damn near every night.
[01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:48.010]  I ask Jesus to protect you and prosper you.
[01:29:48.411 --> 01:29:48.751]  I need that.
[01:29:48.771 --> 01:29:50.231]  That's one reason for my phone call.
[01:29:51.306 --> 01:29:53.167]  Alex, I've got a product line, businessman.
[01:29:53.467 --> 01:29:54.548]  I own it 100%.
[01:29:54.628 --> 01:29:55.508]  Nobody can touch it.
[01:29:55.528 --> 01:29:58.010]  I own my own product lines, trademark.
[01:29:58.630 --> 01:29:59.590]  Products sell pretty good.
[01:30:00.571 --> 01:30:03.212]  And on air, I'm going to company up with Alex.
[01:30:03.232 --> 01:30:04.533]  I'm going to give you the opportunity.
[01:30:05.930 --> 01:30:12.494]  Tell me about it, because I love American ingenuity and I want to know about it.
[01:30:12.814 --> 01:30:13.315]  What's the product?
[01:30:13.335 --> 01:30:15.716]  Well, it's geared to the bicycle industry.
[01:30:15.756 --> 01:30:17.777]  I make highline covers for people.
[01:30:17.797 --> 01:30:21.739]  Bikes are real expensive these days and people don't like other people to know what they have.
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:27.823]  So I make storage covers, I make transit covers, and I make an RV bike bag, which is real popular.
[01:30:28.183 --> 01:30:29.145]  Oh, that's really smart.
[01:30:29.305 --> 01:30:29.825]  Absolutely.
[01:30:29.886 --> 01:30:30.186]  Crime.
[01:30:30.607 --> 01:30:33.070]  That's the next piece I'm going to cover is just the exploding crime.
[01:30:33.451 --> 01:30:35.914]  Well, tell us about your company and I'll get your name and number.
[01:30:35.954 --> 01:30:40.320]  We'll talk about it because that's what we're trying to bring sponsors back on to try to bring in the funds.
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:41.141]  We need to stay on air.
[01:30:41.161 --> 01:30:42.063]  We've been doing some of that.
[01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:43.965]  So I would love to know about it.
[01:30:44.266 --> 01:30:44.846]  Tell me the company.
[01:30:45.829 --> 01:30:47.551]  Well, the name of the company is The Bike Bag.
[01:30:47.631 --> 01:30:54.976]  We basically have four products geared to the RV industry, you know, everyday owner and people who transport their bikes.
[01:30:56.837 --> 01:31:02.021]  And we have some stuff in R&D that looks really good, geared to the RV industry also.
[01:31:02.041 --> 01:31:04.223]  Well, I'm excited about that.
[01:31:04.243 --> 01:31:05.824]  So what's the website so folks can go there?
[01:31:06.384 --> 01:31:08.906]  Well, actually, Alex, I do it all through bill order still.
[01:31:09.106 --> 01:31:09.987]  I don't have a website.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.121]  No, that's beautiful.
[01:31:12.481 --> 01:31:13.081]  That's huge.
[01:31:13.421 --> 01:31:14.742]  Well, you want to give us your name and number?
[01:31:14.943 --> 01:31:15.403]  I will try.
[01:31:15.483 --> 01:31:25.610]  One of my guys will try to call you because we got a $300,000 a month shortfall, and I've almost spent the money for my house sale five, six months ago, which is a very liberating feeling.
[01:31:26.190 --> 01:31:27.071]  I mean, I didn't even care.
[01:31:27.451 --> 01:31:31.374]  I bought a house as an investment, knew this was going on, did a good job.
[01:31:31.394 --> 01:31:35.497]  The house doubled in value in four years, sold it, and that's making payroll right now.
[01:31:35.897 --> 01:31:43.988]   But I'm also kind of looking at my career going, well, in about four or five months, if I don't If I don't get some more funds in here, we're gonna have a problem.
[01:31:44.028 --> 01:31:49.114]  Yeah, other businessmen and people out there, I mean, millionaires, billionaires, you know, the money goes through their head, turns to power.
[01:31:49.154 --> 01:31:50.215]  We know how that works.
[01:31:50.936 --> 01:31:52.217]  And then the evilness comes out.
[01:31:52.457 --> 01:31:53.358]  It's power, you know.
[01:31:53.458 --> 01:31:56.282]  And we're watching that today with everything that's going on.
[01:31:56.762 --> 01:31:59.245]  And I just, I want to reach out to the hearts out there.
[01:32:00.123 --> 01:32:05.868]  Jesus Christ is a wonderful spirit that can come in and help your heart through these times.
[01:32:06.028 --> 01:32:14.054]  If you turn your whole heart to him, he will, you take one step towards him, he's going to take a thousand towards you, and he is a living God.
[01:32:16.797 --> 01:32:21.280]  Jesus is so real, that's why all over the world, the Satanists and the cultists hate it, because it's real.
[01:32:21.961 --> 01:32:25.784]  Oh, Alex, I've dealt with, I've dealt with things that you cannot imagine, my friend.
[01:32:26.144 --> 01:32:28.366]  I have contacts too, I've been very quiet.
[01:32:29.051 --> 01:32:30.111]  For about 10 years.
[01:32:31.132 --> 01:32:33.272]  Back during the Phoenix Lights.
[01:32:35.613 --> 01:32:37.934]  Well, it's actually something I probably shouldn't get on air.
[01:32:37.994 --> 01:32:40.254]  It's going to be lengthy, so I don't want to do that to you.
[01:32:40.274 --> 01:32:44.695]  But it involves things that you could relate to, my friend, and people.
[01:32:45.376 --> 01:32:46.076]  It's beautiful.
[01:32:46.156 --> 01:32:52.918]  And you know, everybody's, what you're getting at is having wild dreams right now and is really getting contacted by the Holy Spirit.
[01:32:53.458 --> 01:32:55.358]  Like God is moving on the earth.
[01:32:55.678 --> 01:32:57.219]  That's why the devil is so upset.
[01:32:58.214 --> 01:32:58.894]  Oh, upset?
[01:32:59.134 --> 01:32:59.955]  He's in charge.
[01:33:00.235 --> 01:33:05.897]  Why do you think all the heads of dignitaries around the world go to Antarctica, that little ice patch out there?
[01:33:06.357 --> 01:33:11.919]  Well, you know, miles deep is a lair, and that's one of the places he actually resides.
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:16.021]  People think, oh, Satan, he's a spirit, a whispering spirit.
[01:33:16.441 --> 01:33:18.042]  He has flesh and bone like we do.
[01:33:20.197 --> 01:33:24.100]  All I know is, well, the thing is based in Antarctica, you know, it crashes there, they dig it up.
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:27.582]  All I know is these people are working against humanity and think they're aliens.
[01:33:27.602 --> 01:33:28.083]  They say that.
[01:33:28.123 --> 01:33:29.223]  They're about to build a new human.
[01:33:29.243 --> 01:33:30.865]  They're going to override us.
[01:33:30.925 --> 01:33:32.286]  The end of humans is about to happen.
[01:33:32.326 --> 01:33:33.146]  That's all over the news.
[01:33:33.186 --> 01:33:36.829]  I mean, whether the devil's a physical thing or not, they sure as hell believe it.
[01:33:37.149 --> 01:33:38.250]  Thank you so much for your call.
[01:33:38.630 --> 01:33:39.030]  Wild.
[01:33:39.431 --> 01:33:40.571]  We're back in 60 seconds.
[01:33:40.611 --> 01:33:41.872]  I'm going right to your calls.
[01:33:42.012 --> 01:33:42.533]  Stay with us.
[01:33:43.524 --> 01:33:51.867]  All right, we got Kara and Jennifer and Thomas and Karen and Anthony and Revolution, Joseph, James, Jake, and so many others.
[01:33:52.567 --> 01:33:55.148]  Let's go right back to your calls, the order they've been received.
[01:33:55.168 --> 01:33:57.268]  I want to thank you again all for calling in today.
[01:33:57.689 --> 01:33:59.729]  Let's talk to Jennifer in Pennsylvania.
[01:33:59.769 --> 01:34:00.509]  Jennifer, welcome.
[01:34:02.230 --> 01:34:02.870]  Hello, Alex.
[01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:03.470]  Hi.
[01:34:04.971 --> 01:34:13.364]   I was looking today on the New York Post, it says that Hunter Biden helped Well, that's a very good question.
[01:34:13.384 --> 01:34:17.928]  I actually have a whole stack on that that I was going to get to a little bit later in the hour.
[01:34:17.948 --> 01:34:19.789]  I'm glad you raised it.
[01:34:19.829 --> 01:34:20.530]  Here's the deal.
[01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:22.191]  I don't go off the New York Post.
[01:34:22.211 --> 01:34:22.892]  I don't go off CNN.
[01:34:22.731 --> 01:34:24.731]  and his son will be arrested?
[01:34:24.731 --> 01:34:26.731]  Well that's a very good question.
[01:34:26.731 --> 01:34:28.731]  I actually have a whole stack on that.
[01:34:28.731 --> 01:34:30.731]  I was going to get to a little bit later in the hour.
[01:34:30.731 --> 01:34:31.731]  I'm glad you raised it.
[01:34:31.731 --> 01:34:33.731]  Here's the deal.
[01:34:33.731 --> 01:34:35.731]  I don't go off the New York Post.
[01:34:35.731 --> 01:34:36.731]  I don't go off CNN.
[01:34:36.731 --> 01:34:39.731]  I don't go off the Associated Press.
[01:34:39.731 --> 01:34:46.731]   Our own Kellyanne McBrain, three weeks ago, wrote three articles proving that Hunter Biden
[01:34:46.731 --> 01:34:53.731]   and his dad, the puppet president, did help run and fund those bioweapon labs.
[01:34:53.913 --> 01:34:55.214]  And guess where we got it?
[01:34:57.495 --> 01:35:03.599]  From the press releases of the companies and what they did and the record of it.
[01:35:04.859 --> 01:35:08.602]  And so, yes, notice it started breaking about a week ago.
[01:35:10.143 --> 01:35:11.964]  After we covered it, not bragging, this is true.
[01:35:12.784 --> 01:35:19.926]  After we covered it, oh, it's Russian disinfo, they're so magical, they're like leprechauns, they just can do whatever they want.
[01:35:19.986 --> 01:35:20.226]  No.
[01:35:21.507 --> 01:35:24.348]  The Russians then, once we covered it, started covering it.
[01:35:24.888 --> 01:35:26.768]  It didn't come from the Russians, it came from us.
[01:35:28.069 --> 01:35:37.352]  And I'm not trying to, like, take credit, it's just so frustrating that, like, a month ago I said, hey, Peter Daszak's Ukrainian and, I mean, I'll just tell you.
[01:35:39.042 --> 01:35:44.825]  I mean, I got a call by a Bilderberg group member and they said, you need to look at DASIC.
[01:35:44.845 --> 01:35:47.686]  You need to look at Ukraine and bio labs.
[01:35:48.387 --> 01:35:54.350]  And then I come to the crew and I go, look at Ukraine and bio labs and Hunter Biden.
[01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:57.151]  And so we talk about it and it becomes the big story.
[01:35:58.052 --> 01:35:59.893]  The Russians didn't come up with it.
[01:36:00.033 --> 01:36:00.473]  We did.
[01:36:01.213 --> 01:36:02.634]  And it wasn't the Russians.
[01:36:03.054 --> 01:36:04.275]  It was a Bilderberg group member.
[01:36:05.083 --> 01:36:07.865]  But I had already been covering the labs they're building everywhere.
[01:36:07.925 --> 01:36:13.328]  So it's not about credit, folks, but you need to know where the credit comes from so you know where it comes from.
[01:36:13.368 --> 01:36:15.990]  Like on a stack of Bibles, what I told you is true.
[01:36:16.230 --> 01:36:22.714]  And you can go back a month ago and you can go read Kellan McBrain's articles three weeks ago, three part series that ended like two weeks ago.
[01:36:23.195 --> 01:36:24.716]  And I mean, it just it's true.
[01:36:25.316 --> 01:36:28.598]  But it's not like you've got to go listen to the New York Post or listen to whoever.
[01:36:29.019 --> 01:36:30.940]  It's in the documents.
[01:36:32.796 --> 01:36:33.056]  Correct.
[01:36:32.876 --> 01:36:33.876]  Correct.
[01:36:33.876 --> 01:36:34.876]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:36:34.876 --> 01:36:35.876]  And what was your other question?
[01:36:35.876 --> 01:36:36.876]  Will he be arrested?
[01:36:36.876 --> 01:36:37.876]  And the answer is no.
[01:36:37.876 --> 01:36:38.876]  No.
[01:36:38.876 --> 01:36:44.155]   He's got a laptop with him screwing at least 100 kids on video, some of them 8 years old.
[01:36:44.155 --> 01:36:47.475]  He's having sex, he's raping his own niece in these videos.
[01:36:47.475 --> 01:36:49.796]  So the answer is no, he's above the law.
[01:36:49.796 --> 01:36:51.715]  Oh, I just, I can't wait.
[01:36:51.723 --> 01:36:54.666]  I just would love to see these people pay the price for what they've done.
[01:36:54.726 --> 01:36:56.327]  But, on to the next thing.
[01:36:56.367 --> 01:36:56.828]  I would too.
[01:36:56.908 --> 01:36:57.428]  I would too.
[01:36:57.809 --> 01:36:58.909]  Doesn't that make you mad?
[01:36:59.010 --> 01:37:02.473]  Like, cause listen, I won't look at it, but it's been looked at by journalists.
[01:37:02.533 --> 01:37:03.073]  It's been seen.
[01:37:03.133 --> 01:37:04.494]  I mean, I'm not going to look at child porn.
[01:37:05.055 --> 01:37:05.856]  And it's confirmed.
[01:37:06.196 --> 01:37:08.738]  It's him having sex with his niece.
[01:37:09.158 --> 01:37:11.040]  I mean, I mean look at the photos of him.
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:12.681]  He's a freaking crackhead.
[01:37:13.502 --> 01:37:16.165]  I got the videos and the photos of it.
[01:37:16.205 --> 01:37:17.266]  It is disgusting.
[01:37:17.586 --> 01:37:18.487]  It is absolutely appalling.
[01:37:18.527 --> 01:37:25.774]  I refuse to look at it, but other trusted people have looked at it, and I'm just, you know... It's totally disgusting, for sure.
[01:37:25.835 --> 01:37:33.903]  And if you have children, if you have little girls, and you see that stuff, it really will wake you the heck up and make you realize this is...
[01:37:34.493 --> 01:37:37.932]  Way far serious there than anybody ever even thought of.
[01:37:37.932 --> 01:37:40.932]   Especially the transgender stuff that's going on in the schools.
[01:37:40.932 --> 01:37:44.092]  I have a 14 year old, he sees it every day.
[01:37:44.092 --> 01:37:50.532]   You know they allow little girls in the boys bathroom and they sit there and talk to the boys while they urinate.
[01:37:50.532 --> 01:37:56.733]   Oh it's all pervert palace attacking men and women's relationship to screw kids up
[01:37:56.733 --> 01:37:59.733]  when kids are experiencing an open...
[01:37:59.892 --> 01:38:05.593]  Supposed to be learning about being friends and holding hands and when they're 12 going to the movies for the first date.
[01:38:06.053 --> 01:38:11.094]  And instead it's, oh you're 5, I'm going to teach you how to shove cucumbers in your butt.
[01:38:11.554 --> 01:38:13.775]  I mean, that's what goes on in Austin.
[01:38:13.915 --> 01:38:16.375]  And I'm sorry to listeners like, hey Jones, we don't want to hear that.
[01:38:16.535 --> 01:38:17.676]  You think I want to say that?
[01:38:18.296 --> 01:38:19.636]  It's worse than what I just said.
[01:38:20.436 --> 01:38:22.217]  I mean, I can't even... I mean, here's the deal.
[01:38:22.237 --> 01:38:26.938]  They've actually defeated me in that I can't look at these videos or read this anymore.
[01:38:27.598 --> 01:38:35.081]  Like, it makes me so mad that I can't even... I mean, it's just... It's unbelievable!
[01:38:35.321 --> 01:38:38.101]  And we just turn our children over to these schools to do this!
[01:38:38.122 --> 01:38:38.882]  Do you remember?
[01:38:38.902 --> 01:38:39.242]  It is.
[01:38:39.302 --> 01:38:39.982]  It's terrible.
[01:38:40.362 --> 01:38:40.922]  It's terrible.
[01:38:40.982 --> 01:38:41.663]  Oh, it's terrible.
[01:38:41.683 --> 01:38:43.263]  It's absolutely terrible.
[01:38:43.283 --> 01:38:44.664]  I just can't even believe it.
[01:38:44.924 --> 01:38:47.004]  It's like watching them torture the Russian soldiers.
[01:38:47.484 --> 01:38:47.905]  God bless you.
[01:38:47.925 --> 01:38:48.585]  I appreciate your call.
[01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:57.772]  And imagine if it's traumatic watching it, like the guy calling up the Russian mom and going, I killed your son, he's dead now.
[01:38:58.252 --> 01:38:59.153]  It's all real, it's confirmed.
[01:38:59.173 --> 01:39:00.233]  The guy's an officer, everything.
[01:39:00.573 --> 01:39:02.814]  And the woman's like, mother's like, my son's dead.
[01:39:02.834 --> 01:39:07.596]  He goes, oh, you pathetic, the dogs are eating his body right now.
[01:39:07.977 --> 01:39:10.738]  Like, who acts like that?
[01:39:11.598 --> 01:39:13.159]  Where do they find these people?
[01:39:16.411 --> 01:39:17.712]  Because he thinks he's above the law.
[01:39:18.392 --> 01:39:27.978]  He thinks he can do anything he wants because the head of the military hospital went on TV last week and said we cut their testicles off.
[01:39:28.398 --> 01:39:31.800]  And I saw that and thought it was war propaganda and then there's the video of him doing it.
[01:39:35.943 --> 01:39:39.765]  And I get it, a man's not gonna strip a dude and take his pants off and cut it off with a knife.
[01:39:40.446 --> 01:39:43.407]  So they follow orders and they shoot him in the groin.
[01:39:44.788 --> 01:39:53.887]   Yeah, there's the video But what's going on these dudes are like brothers by the
[01:39:53.887 --> 01:39:57.424]   way, all right It's unbelievable.
[01:39:57.444 --> 01:39:58.885]  All right, well, I mean, let's go to the caller.
[01:39:59.125 --> 01:40:00.626]  Karen in California.
[01:40:00.646 --> 01:40:02.206]  Karen, thank you so much for holding.
[01:40:02.226 --> 01:40:02.507]  Welcome.
[01:40:04.087 --> 01:40:04.628]  Yes, hello?
[01:40:05.188 --> 01:40:05.868]  Hi, thank you.
[01:40:07.509 --> 01:40:09.390]  Yes, thank you so much for taking my phone call.
[01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:14.472]  So I'm calling about 10 proposed bills in the state of California.
[01:40:14.512 --> 01:40:17.533]  We're here on the frontline of medical tyranny.
[01:40:19.449 --> 01:40:26.272]  These bills will probably all pass in the next two weeks because there's a Democratic supermajority, but we're trying to fight it.
[01:40:26.832 --> 01:40:30.094]  They're trying to make COVID-19 injections mandatory.
[01:40:34.090 --> 01:40:44.116]  From preschool to 12, they're trying to classify anti-COVID medical opinions as unprofessional conduct subject to discipline by the medical boards.
[01:40:44.256 --> 01:40:45.597]  They're trying to lower... Absolutely.
[01:40:45.677 --> 01:40:50.320]  If a doctor says, I gave a patient this, or my patient got sick, they get in trouble.
[01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:54.743]  So it's not just since they're Alex Jones now, it's since they're doctors or nurses.
[01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:57.060]  Correct.
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:02.401]  Well, subject them to discipline by the medical board in California.
[01:41:03.021 --> 01:41:08.022]  Lowering the age of vaccine consent to 12 without parental control or knowledge.
[01:41:09.702 --> 01:41:16.404]  Authorizes the medical board to inspect the doctor's office and medical records without a patient's consent.
[01:41:16.824 --> 01:41:18.484]  Violations of HIPAA, everything, yeah.
[01:41:18.844 --> 01:41:21.545]  A total, because the globalists are rapists.
[01:41:21.585 --> 01:41:23.505]  They want to rape you every way they can.
[01:41:24.665 --> 01:41:25.426]  Rape your rights.
[01:41:25.546 --> 01:41:26.407]  Rape your privacy.
[01:41:26.507 --> 01:41:27.187]  Rape your body.
[01:41:27.528 --> 01:41:28.328]  Rape your DNA.
[01:41:28.448 --> 01:41:29.289]  Rape your children.
[01:41:29.349 --> 01:41:30.110]  Rape your God.
[01:41:30.450 --> 01:41:30.730]  Rape.
[01:41:31.731 --> 01:41:32.012]  Rape.
[01:41:32.432 --> 01:41:33.092]  That's what they like.
[01:41:33.133 --> 01:41:33.713]  They're rapists.
[01:41:35.615 --> 01:41:38.998]  And that's why they say sex between a man and a woman is consensual is rape.
[01:41:39.458 --> 01:41:44.683]  The one sex that isn't rape is what they hate is that consensual love and coming together.
[01:41:44.923 --> 01:41:48.686]  They say that's bad while everything they do is about raping our freedom.
[01:41:49.127 --> 01:41:50.728]  They are the rapists.
[01:41:50.788 --> 01:41:51.629]  I'm sorry I'm ranting.
[01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:53.630]  No, not at all.
[01:41:54.290 --> 01:42:00.671]  Another bill requires law enforcement to enforce the public health orders of the public health officials.
[01:42:00.871 --> 01:42:03.892]  Oh yeah, that's the one they passed in Oregon in places for martial law.
[01:42:04.252 --> 01:42:08.213]  Spend time on that, because the guys are, the gals, the crew is pulling up these links.
[01:42:08.653 --> 01:42:09.733]  Tell folks about that.
[01:42:09.793 --> 01:42:10.593]  That is so key.
[01:42:11.493 --> 01:42:11.913]  Okay, yeah.
[01:42:11.993 --> 01:42:20.135]  If you go to unityprojectonline.com and then take action, you can see all of these ten bad bills.
[01:42:22.353 --> 01:42:32.232]  Basically, it was introduced by Senator Pan, so it requires all sheriffs to execute all lawful orders of a department in their counties.
[01:42:33.371 --> 01:42:41.517]  Existing laws, I don't know, it's kind of long, but it basically turns them into dictators, all the public health officials.
[01:42:41.617 --> 01:42:46.101]  And, you know, there's no time for public comment or anything.
[01:42:46.241 --> 01:42:49.443]  Yeah, it's all the same globalist UN agenda.
[01:42:49.884 --> 01:42:51.525]  Get rid of medical due process.
[01:42:52.065 --> 01:42:54.667]  Let the police arrest you if someone claims you were coughing.
[01:42:55.288 --> 01:42:56.589]  Biomedical tyranny.
[01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:58.070]  Karen, thank you so much.
[01:42:58.730 --> 01:43:01.493]  So sad to see that beautiful state of California being destroyed like that.
[01:43:02.113 --> 01:43:03.273]  The people are really waking up there.
[01:43:03.613 --> 01:43:05.614]  We'll be back in T-minus four minutes.
[01:43:06.034 --> 01:43:11.896]  And we're going directly to phone calls from Anthony, Revolution, Joseph.
[01:43:12.876 --> 01:43:15.997]  Well, we're going to talk to Kara right now here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:16.077 --> 01:43:17.577]  And man, she's a weirdo.
[01:43:18.637 --> 01:43:19.418]  Imagine her.
[01:43:19.498 --> 01:43:21.118]  She's a conspiracy theorist.
[01:43:21.798 --> 01:43:23.699]  She's asking questions.
[01:43:25.759 --> 01:43:31.972]   She says she thinks the Oscars With a bunch of actors is fake?
[01:43:36.315 --> 01:43:39.177]  I mean, is that not the craziest thing you've ever heard?
[01:43:40.198 --> 01:43:48.944]  If a war's starting, they claim WMDs, or Jussie Smollett says two white guys dumped bleach on him, put a rope around his neck at 2.30 in the morning at 20 below zero.
[01:43:48.964 --> 01:43:52.367]  Of course, that was fake, but still.
[01:43:53.433 --> 01:43:59.857]  How dare her not buy a bunch of actors doing something like this to dominate and get all this attention?
[01:43:59.877 --> 01:44:01.578]  Of course it's fake.
[01:44:01.598 --> 01:44:02.979]  The whole thing's even badly done.
[01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:07.142]  Karen, give us your view of the Oscars last night and what you think was happening.
[01:44:08.523 --> 01:44:18.570]   Hey Alex, I was calling because, I mean, if somebody came up to a guy very aggressively And hit him.
[01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:22.632]  Is he just gonna stand there and take it and just do like a flat wow?
[01:44:22.652 --> 01:44:23.832]  Like, wow!
[01:44:23.932 --> 01:44:25.573]  And then say that was the greatest moment?
[01:44:25.613 --> 01:44:30.576]  But exactly, get to your point, but people have now, what I saw on the video, they've now gotten HD of it.
[01:44:31.116 --> 01:44:41.982]  He literally makes eye contact, waits, knows it's coming, gets ready, braces for impact, turns the neck, leans in, weak throw, sissy smack.
[01:44:42.943 --> 01:44:45.484]  I mean, it absolutely was staged.
[01:44:45.524 --> 01:44:46.845]  I mean, this is ridiculous!
[01:44:48.072 --> 01:44:59.194]  Yes, it's a stage way to physically assault any politically incorrect comedian, to put them in their place and remind the viewers what to do when someone says something offensive.
[01:44:59.394 --> 01:45:00.635]  You know, they're promoting violence.
[01:45:01.755 --> 01:45:02.455]  Well, that's it.
[01:45:02.535 --> 01:45:12.097]  I mean, what they're doing is taking an event with like 5 million viewers down from 40 million 10 years ago and just doing this to like put the word Oscar out there.
[01:45:12.477 --> 01:45:14.597]  This is the death throes of Hollywood, what you're seeing.
[01:45:14.897 --> 01:45:17.598]  Them having to clown around and slap each other like the Three Stooges.
[01:45:18.908 --> 01:45:20.509]  Okay Alex, can you do something for me?
[01:45:21.629 --> 01:45:21.890]  Yes.
[01:45:23.090 --> 01:45:25.532]  Can you say, I'm a gorilla?
[01:45:26.512 --> 01:45:27.072]  You like that?
[01:45:28.073 --> 01:45:28.353]  Yeah.
[01:45:29.093 --> 01:45:39.059]  I've had so many women come up to me on the street, and like even friends and stuff, and like one of my mom's oldest friends, she loves Tim Pool, and she loved that, I'm a gorilla, murder yourselves.
[01:45:39.079 --> 01:45:40.239]  Yeah, I got the shirt, yeah.
[01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:43.361]  I'm a gorilla, murder yourselves.
[01:45:44.041 --> 01:45:44.562]  You like that?
[01:45:45.555 --> 01:45:49.478]  Yeah, I wear it in public and people are like, what is that?
[01:45:49.498 --> 01:45:52.700]  I'm like, yeah, you know, I'm a gorilla, Kara.
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:53.761]  All right, Kara.
[01:45:53.861 --> 01:45:55.222]  Is that what you want to thank you?
[01:45:55.662 --> 01:45:55.922]  All right.
[01:45:55.962 --> 01:45:56.523]  What a sweetheart.
[01:45:57.543 --> 01:45:57.944]  All right.
[01:45:57.984 --> 01:45:59.404]  Let's go to the next caller here.
[01:46:00.105 --> 01:46:01.366]  Who would be next?
[01:46:02.146 --> 01:46:03.207]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:46:04.348 --> 01:46:08.931]  I spy Joseph in New York.
[01:46:09.091 --> 01:46:09.912]  Joseph, go ahead.
[01:46:09.952 --> 01:46:10.252]  Welcome.
[01:46:11.161 --> 01:46:13.762]  Hey Alex, Joseph from Long Island, New York.
[01:46:14.083 --> 01:46:17.945]  First off, I just wanted to say that me and my friends, we love your stickers.
[01:46:18.625 --> 01:46:25.749]  We go around at night and we put them on stop signs, and I feel like, you know, the stop sign is the first place that people look, and especially they look at the sticker.
[01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:30.632]  Oh, if you want to make a leftist take a piss in their pants, put an InfoWare sticker up.
[01:46:31.572 --> 01:46:34.214]  Oh, well, I feel like they're gone in a week.
[01:46:34.274 --> 01:46:36.975]  It's the first sticker to get put down, to get taken down.
[01:46:37.716 --> 01:46:39.377]  And the funnest part is to keep doing it.
[01:46:40.677 --> 01:46:48.342]  Because I go hiking a lot, so I take like some of my pocket and I stick them up, and when they take them down I put super glue on them so they can't get them off.
[01:46:48.742 --> 01:46:54.205]  And then you'll see like one scratched off, took some limb dart like 20 minutes to do it.
[01:46:54.225 --> 01:46:57.407]  That's actually a really smart idea to put like Gorilla Glue on the back of it.
[01:46:57.547 --> 01:46:58.007]  Yes sir.
[01:46:58.027 --> 01:46:59.028]  Never really thought about that.
[01:46:59.928 --> 01:47:04.171]  Um, so to get to my second point, I just want to... Portraying sensors is my specialty.
[01:47:06.383 --> 01:47:13.487]  Um, to get to my second point, I just wanted to bring up the upcoming 2022 midterm election, especially like New York's midterm election.
[01:47:14.267 --> 01:47:28.694]  I feel like, you know, recently at the Ranger game, probably like maybe a last week or a week, or like a week and a half ago, Kathy Hochul dropped the puck, or ceremonially dropped the puck, and she got booed by practically everyone, and she seemed mad, very uncomfortable.
[01:47:29.801 --> 01:47:34.163]  Do you think that New York is in play in the upcoming governor's race?
[01:47:34.663 --> 01:47:36.043]  And if so, under who?
[01:47:36.964 --> 01:47:41.365]  Well, I don't think LA and New York and Austin are in play.
[01:47:41.525 --> 01:47:43.106]  I know there's election fraud in place.
[01:47:43.626 --> 01:47:48.207]  That's why once Democrat criminal machines take over, you never get out from under them.
[01:47:48.227 --> 01:47:50.928]  I mean, we've proven Travis County is Republican.
[01:47:51.549 --> 01:47:53.689]  We've proven it, but they just steal elections, brother.
[01:47:54.069 --> 01:47:55.390]  So of course New York's in play.
[01:47:55.990 --> 01:48:01.132]  Do you think New Yorkers want crime and collapse and garbage and rats running around?
[01:48:01.472 --> 01:48:03.152]  Do you really think they want what they've got?
[01:48:03.232 --> 01:48:03.852]  No, they don't.
[01:48:04.453 --> 01:48:06.173]  And so, no, there's massive election fraud.
[01:48:06.193 --> 01:48:08.674]  And until that gets fixed, I don't know what you're going to do.
[01:48:09.374 --> 01:48:10.074]  You're completely right.
[01:48:10.094 --> 01:48:12.815]  Like, look at the most recent New Jersey governor's race.
[01:48:12.915 --> 01:48:16.076]  I mean, he was down in the polls probably like 20 percent.
[01:48:16.176 --> 01:48:18.017]  And that day, he lost by three.
[01:48:18.477 --> 01:48:21.478]  I mean, if you think about it, who are all those people that went on his side?
[01:48:23.375 --> 01:48:24.156]  Oh, that's it.
[01:48:24.176 --> 01:48:24.496]  You're right.
[01:48:24.516 --> 01:48:25.756]  The facade has fallen.
[01:48:25.897 --> 01:48:27.477]  Nobody likes the governor of New York.
[01:48:27.597 --> 01:48:28.938]  Nobody likes the mayor of New York.
[01:48:29.418 --> 01:48:30.539]  Everybody likes New Yorkers.
[01:48:31.179 --> 01:48:39.303]  And they're just trying to bring in as many third world people as they can, not that they're bad, but they don't know even how to speak English, to control and scare them and manipulate them.
[01:48:39.744 --> 01:48:42.025]  But half the time they wake up and join us anyway.
[01:48:42.105 --> 01:48:44.286]  So it's all blowing up in their face.
[01:48:44.326 --> 01:48:46.647]  We're going to beat them as long as we know we're going to beat them.
[01:48:46.687 --> 01:48:47.548]  Thank you so much, brother.
[01:48:48.268 --> 01:48:48.528]  All right.
[01:48:48.548 --> 01:48:49.489]  Let's take another call here.
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:53.621]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Indiana.
[01:48:53.661 --> 01:48:54.242]  James, welcome.
[01:48:56.043 --> 01:48:56.644]  Hey, Alex.
[01:48:56.984 --> 01:49:00.087]  Just to let you know, DOJ is a 747 plane wreck.
[01:49:00.867 --> 01:49:05.751]  747 errors and misconduct coming out on rigged federal cases being reported by Fox.
[01:49:05.771 --> 01:49:10.075]  It's against college standards to convict anyone when the system is rigged and can't be trusted.
[01:49:10.455 --> 01:49:13.858]  You guys need to look up Whistleblower Whitehurst, how they were using the crime lab in the past.
[01:49:13.958 --> 01:49:15.279]  Oh, I know Whitehurst.
[01:49:15.319 --> 01:49:17.100]  He's been on the show many times years ago, yeah.
[01:49:17.721 --> 01:49:20.223]  He saw them framing totally innocent people at the crime lab.
[01:49:21.417 --> 01:49:22.117]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:49:22.137 --> 01:49:23.498]  You can also look up Tara Moorhead.
[01:49:23.518 --> 01:49:27.579]  She was bringing in witnesses and saying, hey, you need to go in there and lie to the courts.
[01:49:27.939 --> 01:49:29.820]  Yeah, let's get Frederick Weihurst back on.
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:30.840]  He hasn't been on in 10 years.
[01:49:31.361 --> 01:49:45.025]  I mean, I haven't gotten to this yet, and I should make a big deal about it and have it all out there, but they call up and they go, we want you to come testify about January 6th and, you know, how it was all orchestrated or whatever, all made up, or we're going to up the charges on Owen for no reason.
[01:49:45.045 --> 01:49:49.728]   I mean, it's just like, it's like, Literally, like Al Capone telling you he's going to break your legs.
[01:49:49.768 --> 01:49:52.491]  At a certain point, it's just like, whatever, just do it.
[01:49:53.211 --> 01:49:56.814]  I mean, it's insane that our government is this criminal.
[01:49:57.775 --> 01:49:58.255]  Well, they're corrupt.
[01:49:58.275 --> 01:49:59.356]  Nothing they do can be trusted.
[01:49:59.476 --> 01:50:01.398]  Well, they don't even hide it!
[01:50:01.838 --> 01:50:05.201]  They're calling major talk show hosts, threatening them.
[01:50:05.881 --> 01:50:07.903]  Like I'm some crack dealer like them.
[01:50:09.195 --> 01:50:11.955]  Well, it's disgusting because they've been fixing and rigging text messages.
[01:50:11.975 --> 01:50:12.896]  Nobody checks for an ID.
[01:50:12.936 --> 01:50:13.956]  There's no chain of custody.
[01:50:14.396 --> 01:50:18.777]  That's why, you know, I'm not a fan of Hunter Biden, but there's no chain of custody and passwords are stored.
[01:50:18.817 --> 01:50:20.917]  So anything, email, anything like that, they've been caught rigging.
[01:50:20.957 --> 01:50:21.717]  No, I mean, I get it.
[01:50:21.757 --> 01:50:22.317]  I mean, I get it.
[01:50:22.377 --> 01:50:26.458]  Like they sent me child porn on record and the news all ran that I had child porn.
[01:50:26.478 --> 01:50:26.738]  Oh, really?
[01:50:26.758 --> 01:50:27.458]  Well, I'm not arrested.
[01:50:27.798 --> 01:50:28.498]  They sent it to me.
[01:50:28.518 --> 01:50:29.319]  I never opened it.
[01:50:29.579 --> 01:50:32.539]  And they knew just what email when they sued me to ask for it again.
[01:50:32.559 --> 01:50:34.980]  Yeah, it's disgusting.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.260]  I want to go to a second, last point here.
[01:50:38.136 --> 01:50:39.337]  It's about veterans real quick.
[01:50:40.278 --> 01:50:45.883]  Sometime this week it'll be coming out, how the government is fueling the veteran suicide epidemic, and it's 50 times bigger than the Phoenix scandal.
[01:50:46.603 --> 01:50:48.645]  I've sent this stuff over to Majorie Green.
[01:50:48.665 --> 01:50:49.706]  She's aware of what's going on.
[01:50:49.726 --> 01:50:52.468]  So if you ever want to talk to her about it, but it should be coming out this week.
[01:50:52.989 --> 01:50:53.829]  It's huge, brother.
[01:50:54.009 --> 01:50:55.050]  Thank you so much, James.
[01:50:55.070 --> 01:50:55.731]  We're gonna come back.
[01:50:57.572 --> 01:50:59.154]  We're doing a pretty good job today taking calls.
[01:50:59.174 --> 01:51:02.697]  We're gonna talk to... Who's up next here?
[01:51:04.548 --> 01:51:05.908]  We're going to talk to Revolution.
[01:51:06.489 --> 01:51:10.530]  We're going to talk to Melissa, Mike, Jake, and others straight ahead.
[01:51:10.610 --> 01:51:15.091]  Toll free number to join us, 877-789-2539.
[01:51:15.751 --> 01:51:17.512]  A little less talk, a little more action.
[01:51:17.792 --> 01:51:24.734]  We're all about talk, put into action, put into victory, put into renaissance.
[01:51:27.458 --> 01:51:39.410]  Revolution, you're up next in New York, then Mike in New York and others on this live Monday, March 28th show that is here in defiance of everything the globalist censors and control freaks have done.
[01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:43.735]  And I give all that credit to the great audience and the affiliates and our crew in here.
[01:51:43.915 --> 01:51:44.816]  I salute you all.
[01:51:45.497 --> 01:51:47.118]  Let's go back to the calls here.
[01:51:47.178 --> 01:51:48.800]  Revolution in New York.
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:49.441]  Let us have it.
[01:51:51.297 --> 01:51:52.077]  Hey, what's going on?
[01:51:52.097 --> 01:52:01.081]  First of all, before I start, I just want to ask, you talked about you saw a foot stomp, Will Smith stomp his foot before he slapped him or as he slapped him.
[01:52:02.401 --> 01:52:03.762]  I didn't see that, so I don't know.
[01:52:03.842 --> 01:52:05.722]  Well, let's just put the image up on screen.
[01:52:05.903 --> 01:52:12.785]  I mean, I certainly heard a foot stomp, looked like he hit his feet, slapped it, not from a high level, but like the wrestlers do.
[01:52:13.325 --> 01:52:15.006]  Are you saying you think that was real?
[01:52:15.026 --> 01:52:24.029]   Because I saw Chris Rock, stick his face out, grimace like he knew it was about to happen, when that slap was really fast.
[01:52:24.069 --> 01:52:25.671]  That looks like he was getting ready for that slap.
[01:52:26.952 --> 01:52:28.254]  Yeah, I hear what you're saying.
[01:52:28.354 --> 01:52:30.797]  I don't, I didn't see, I don't, didn't see that.
[01:52:30.917 --> 01:52:31.517]  You get what I'm saying?
[01:52:31.537 --> 01:52:33.560]  Like I didn't see him lean in, do anything like that.
[01:52:34.315 --> 01:52:36.377]  What I saw, let me tell you what I saw.
[01:52:36.437 --> 01:52:44.023]  What I saw was a couple of individuals who have never participated in anything like that at any point in their lives except for when they were children.
[01:52:44.423 --> 01:52:48.306]  Meaning, you saw a punk walk up on stage and assault another punk.
[01:52:48.446 --> 01:52:49.167]  You get what I'm saying?
[01:52:49.687 --> 01:52:52.830]  Neither one of them has ever fought probably a day in their life.
[01:52:53.370 --> 01:53:08.841]   So what the world is seeing is something fake and staged What I see is a couple of awkward men who've never participated in anything like that ever in their lives except for when they were kids, and they basically just showed themselves to be cool.
[01:53:09.301 --> 01:53:11.823]  That's just what I saw, at least in terms of Will.
[01:53:12.724 --> 01:53:18.529]  Chris, from what I understand, he made a statement afterwards saying that he didn't even write that joke.
[01:53:19.187 --> 01:53:20.968]  So that was something the Academy did.
[01:53:21.228 --> 01:53:22.208]  Maybe to egg him on.
[01:53:22.228 --> 01:53:24.649]  Maybe to egg Will Smith on so he could do something like that.
[01:53:24.669 --> 01:53:30.011]  Because, you know, something going on with his wife... But how would you imagine if you just made a G.I.
[01:53:30.031 --> 01:53:35.773]  Jane quote, which was a compliment overall, why would that make him attack him?
[01:53:35.813 --> 01:53:41.115]  It's all just a bunch of weird, sick, crazy Hollywood scum trying to take over our lives.
[01:53:41.155 --> 01:53:47.998]  Look, you have Chris Rock grimacing his face before he's even slapped.
[01:53:49.045 --> 01:53:50.606]  I don't believe he did that.
[01:53:50.626 --> 01:53:53.967]  I don't believe he did that at all.
[01:53:53.827 --> 01:53:57.547]   If somebody's about to slap you, before even the hand goes up, you don't go, "Mm!"
[01:53:57.547 --> 01:53:59.427]  You don't stick your face out and go, "Mm!"
[01:53:59.427 --> 01:54:00.427]  Getting ready.
[01:54:00.427 --> 01:54:01.266]  See that?
[01:54:01.266 --> 01:54:02.586]  I don't believe he did that.
[01:54:02.586 --> 01:54:04.226]  I don't believe he did that at all.
[01:54:04.226 --> 01:54:10.386]   What I saw was someone looking at an aggressive man coming towards him, and then he just got assaulted,
[01:54:10.386 --> 01:54:12.106]  and he just wasn't prepared for that.
[01:54:12.106 --> 01:54:12.947]  That's just, that's just--
[01:54:12.947 --> 01:54:14.787]  All right, well, it's the top story in the world.
[01:54:14.787 --> 01:54:20.587]   While world markets fall, while the dollar's devalued, while inflation explodes, while they're coming after
[01:54:20.587 --> 01:54:22.387]  our babies with experimental shots.
[01:54:22.924 --> 01:54:25.386]  Hollywood, yet again, is making us focus on them.
[01:54:26.547 --> 01:54:27.328]  That's not my point.
[01:54:27.568 --> 01:54:28.329]  My point is this.
[01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:32.772]  There's nothing Hollywood could do that could make anybody watch that show.
[01:54:32.812 --> 01:54:33.733]  That show is garbage.
[01:54:34.093 --> 01:54:35.054]  No one's going to watch it.
[01:54:35.114 --> 01:54:36.355]  No one's watching it next year.
[01:54:36.675 --> 01:54:38.817]  No one wants to partake in that.
[01:54:39.197 --> 01:54:40.018]  My point is this.
[01:54:40.858 --> 01:54:42.560]  Will Smith is a fallen man.
[01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:46.891]  I don't know what Will Smith's done.
[01:54:46.911 --> 01:54:49.353]  I'll be honest with you, I'm not following what he's doing.
[01:54:49.373 --> 01:54:51.875]  I'm following my family and what's happening in the world.
[01:54:51.935 --> 01:54:54.057]  And that's what I'm telling you, the Hollywood thing is disgusting.
[01:54:54.117 --> 01:54:55.158]  I hate the whole damn thing.
[01:54:55.178 --> 01:54:56.519]  And here we are talking about them.
[01:54:56.378 --> 01:54:58.639]  I appreciate your call. I don't know what Will Smith's done.
[01:54:58.639 --> 01:55:02.837]   I'll be honest with you. I'm not following what he's doing. I'm following my family and what's
[01:55:02.837 --> 01:55:04.057]  happening in the world.
[01:55:04.057 --> 01:55:07.099]   And I tell them the Hollywood thing is disgusting. I hate the whole damn thing.
[01:55:07.099 --> 01:55:10.858]  And here we are talking about them. My bash in the collar.
[01:55:10.858 --> 01:55:18.858]   I just, I just, Will Smith and his family and Will Smith and his, yeah.
[01:55:19.128 --> 01:55:20.750]  Will Smith giving himself to men?
[01:55:20.770 --> 01:55:22.791]  I mean, what?
[01:55:24.453 --> 01:55:26.095]  All right, let's go ahead and take some calls here.
[01:55:26.115 --> 01:55:29.958]  Uh, let's go ahead and go to, uh, who's up next here.
[01:55:30.699 --> 01:55:31.980]  Jake in Colorado.
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:32.681]  Jake, go ahead.
[01:55:32.721 --> 01:55:33.281]  Thanks for holding.
[01:55:34.623 --> 01:55:35.263]  Hey yo, Alex.
[01:55:35.624 --> 01:55:35.884]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:37.028 --> 01:55:38.850]  We gotta ignore that celebrity stuff, man.
[01:55:38.890 --> 01:55:42.092]  We gotta start calling out these puppet masters, you know?
[01:55:42.112 --> 01:55:42.472]  No, I agree.
[01:55:42.492 --> 01:55:45.415]  I only brought it up because it shows how they do false flags in front of us.
[01:55:46.436 --> 01:55:54.342]  I know, they're just trying to, you know, distract us with all that kind of garbage, but even the puppet masters, we gotta start looking higher than that, the executive producers of the show.
[01:55:55.203 --> 01:55:56.644]  Those are the people we need to start looking at.
[01:55:57.565 --> 01:56:00.067]  Who are the executive producers of the New World Order?
[01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:02.941]  I mean, the people you don't see their faces.
[01:56:02.961 --> 01:56:04.182]  You know, we have Klaus Schwab and stuff.
[01:56:04.202 --> 01:56:07.044]  We know who those people are, but who are the people above those people?
[01:56:07.625 --> 01:56:08.285]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:56:08.305 --> 01:56:09.586]  The people we never see.
[01:56:12.748 --> 01:56:15.690]  Well, if I don't know one thing about powerful, rich people, they don't want to be known.
[01:56:16.831 --> 01:56:17.351]  Exactly.
[01:56:18.012 --> 01:56:21.094]  And, you know, I've been in the music industry and making music my whole life.
[01:56:21.134 --> 01:56:22.675]  I'm a failed rapper, technically.
[01:56:22.715 --> 01:56:29.340]  But lately, when I switched over my gimmick, I've been getting a lot more play on the patriotic rap and calling out the Great Reset.
[01:56:30.387 --> 01:56:35.849]  And that's what we got to start doing is just don't even acknowledge these celebrity garbage.
[01:56:37.029 --> 01:56:37.609]  Well, I agree.
[01:56:37.629 --> 01:56:39.289]  But I mean, it's the top story.
[01:56:39.349 --> 01:56:44.191]  So you got to point out how it's a distraction and diversion, you know, as a top story.
[01:56:44.531 --> 01:56:48.692]  So what's your what's your new handle as the anti-reset rapper?
[01:56:49.932 --> 01:56:51.893]  Oh, I go by Freedom La Truth.
[01:56:53.893 --> 01:56:54.814]  Freedom La Truth.
[01:56:54.834 --> 01:56:55.514]  Well, we'll check it out.
[01:56:55.534 --> 01:56:55.994]  Anything else?
[01:56:57.729 --> 01:57:00.693]  Yeah, I wanted to plug 50percentoff.com.
[01:57:00.733 --> 01:57:01.854]  You haven't plugged it in a while.
[01:57:02.095 --> 01:57:12.047]  I just went over there and ordered a bunch of the silver products, the lotion, Brain Force Ultra, you know, a lot of stuff that you can't even get on InfoWarsStore over there at 50percentoff.com.
[01:57:12.486 --> 01:57:14.267]  No, that's right, 50percentoff.com.
[01:57:14.387 --> 01:57:21.732]  You know, the reason I've worked with other folks, I don't run that site, I don't own that site, is they're trying to shut down Infoworkstore.com.
[01:57:22.453 --> 01:57:30.098]  And so we're trying to diversify with other sites, other people, other groups to get a discount in case they try to shut down the main shopping cart, which they've been trying constantly.
[01:57:30.478 --> 01:57:31.278]  We have some backups.
[01:57:31.318 --> 01:57:37.122]  Yeah, 50percentoffhub.com is really great and it helps keep us on the air.
[01:57:37.582 --> 01:57:40.945]  And we also have, ladies and gentlemen, the Tree of Liberty coin.
[01:57:42.133 --> 01:57:44.395]  Last coin sold out in about 10 days.
[01:57:44.495 --> 01:57:45.516]  It's nine and a half days.
[01:57:46.277 --> 01:57:47.077]  That'll be technical.
[01:57:48.799 --> 01:57:52.242]  And so the new coin is the third, or is the second, in a three-part series.
[01:57:52.762 --> 01:57:59.168]  The new coin is the second in a three-part series and is exclusively available at InfoWorksStore.com.
[01:57:59.188 --> 01:58:01.449]  So we're very, very proud of the coin.
[01:58:02.498 --> 01:58:38.394]   And you can again find it at InfoWareStore.com or you can go to 1776Coin.com and it's following the same trend as last time that it will end up selling out within 10 days and that's good because it's the last coin, I've done the math, I've done the numbers, and it's the last coin that is even letting us make payroll, pay for the bandwidth, which again is great, I'm not complaining, but We serve out, on average, 7 million videos a day at Bandai Video.
[01:58:39.835 --> 01:58:46.881]  And we serve out more than 5 million audio and video streams every day at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:58:47.381 --> 01:58:48.682]  And that costs money.
[01:58:49.483 --> 01:58:52.626]  And we have our own infrastructure, our own servers, our own everything.
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:55.961]  When you're on YouTube or you're on Instagram, man, it's easy.
[01:58:55.981 --> 01:58:57.242]  You just upload there, it's there.
[01:58:57.282 --> 01:58:58.083]  They pay for it all.
[01:58:58.463 --> 01:59:00.444]  We are a standalone system.
[01:59:01.204 --> 01:59:03.906]  In fact, Trump can't even basically launch a social network or anything.
[01:59:03.946 --> 01:59:04.526]  I wish he could.
[01:59:04.987 --> 01:59:06.968]  We would love to work with Trump or anybody else.
[01:59:06.988 --> 01:59:08.469]  We've got a network infrastructure.
[01:59:08.789 --> 01:59:09.609]  We've got it all set up.
[01:59:09.649 --> 01:59:11.150]  Hell, Joe Rogan's been here many times.
[01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:14.192]  It's like, man, if they ever kicked me on Spotify, I could just use all this.
[01:59:14.812 --> 01:59:22.857]  I mean, that's what we're talking about is we built this knowing the censorship was coming, knowing we had to have our own infrastructure.
[01:59:24.994 --> 01:59:29.575]  And then three or four years after I got the infrastructure built, they hit us and shut us down.
[01:59:30.095 --> 01:59:34.397]  And now we've upgraded it and it's just an ongoing war and God just keeps me on empty.
[01:59:34.977 --> 01:59:38.318]  God just keeps me right there with just enough to keep things going.
[01:59:39.298 --> 01:59:46.700]  You know, I guess you just show me how real all this is, but I want to thank you all for the money we have because without you, we wouldn't be here.
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:48.921]  So, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:59:50.563 --> 01:59:58.748]  Or 1776coin.com, just 1776coin.com, just the numbers, then coin.com, 1776coin.com.
[01:59:59.248 --> 02:00:03.030]  And this will sell out, so please keep us on air, get a piece of history.
[02:00:03.070 --> 02:00:07.353]  These coins are selling two, three times on eBay and stuff, what people buy them for.
[02:00:07.533 --> 02:00:11.515]  There is a markup, that's the funder operation, and they will sell out.
[02:00:11.555 --> 02:00:13.496]  It's following the exact same trend of last time.
[02:00:13.837 --> 02:00:21.952]   So thank God, because it'll be the funds of this that help us stay on air, because as I said, I sold my house.
[02:00:22.973 --> 02:00:23.974]  I bought it as an investment.
[02:00:25.075 --> 02:00:27.116]  Families are like, well, you never really buy big houses.
[02:00:27.136 --> 02:00:28.978]  I'm like, well, this is an investment for money later.
[02:00:29.318 --> 02:00:30.879]  And then it doubled in price three years.
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:31.760]  I sold it.
[02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:33.461]  And now I'm dumping that into the operation.
[02:00:33.742 --> 02:00:37.525]  I'm all in right now with what's happening because history is unfolding.
[02:00:37.565 --> 02:00:39.326]  We've all got to be all in right now.
[02:00:39.346 --> 02:00:41.088]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:00:41.568 --> 02:00:43.029]  We'll be back in two minutes with your calls.
[02:00:43.550 --> 02:00:44.691]  Then Gerald Salente is coming up.
[02:00:46.189 --> 02:00:47.510]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:47.530 --> 02:00:49.792]  Let's go to New York City or New York State.
[02:00:49.832 --> 02:00:50.252]  I'm not sure.
[02:00:50.272 --> 02:00:51.433]  It just says New York.
[02:00:51.973 --> 02:00:53.314]  Mike, welcome.
[02:00:53.334 --> 02:00:57.017]  You want to talk about Ukraine and Russia and the videos of shootings and torture.
[02:00:57.037 --> 02:00:57.817]  What do you think about that?
[02:00:57.837 --> 02:01:00.859]  Hey Alex, thank you for taking the call.
[02:01:00.919 --> 02:01:01.780]  Really appreciate it.
[02:01:02.726 --> 02:01:04.688]  Um, so I wanted to get your take on this.
[02:01:05.569 --> 02:01:13.975]  So we've seen these videos over the last couple of days of these maniacs, uh, shooting these Russian soldiers and committing the war crimes.
[02:01:14.496 --> 02:01:25.745]  And we've also seen some videos, I don't know if it was on your show or on one of the others, where we have these young kids in these like neo-Nazi brigades, Sieg Heiling and all that other stuff.
[02:01:26.546 --> 02:01:36.457]   And so I'm piecing these two things together in a sense where These soldiers from Ukraine, military-age men, are probably, what, 18 to 20 years old.
[02:01:37.358 --> 02:01:45.480]  And when all this crazy stuff happened in Ukraine about eight years ago, these were young kids, probably around 10, 12 years old, 13, 14 years old.
[02:01:46.420 --> 02:01:58.007]   Just imagine, just trying to say, look at it from both sides and say, these kids are product of the new world New World Order, propaganda, mind control.
[02:01:58.348 --> 02:02:06.953]  Imagine the stuff that they've been feeding these kids, teaching them Russians are bad and these people are horrible people.
[02:02:06.993 --> 02:02:10.115]  Meanwhile, like you've said, these are basically like their cousins.
[02:02:10.515 --> 02:02:11.296]  These are their neighbors.
[02:02:12.194 --> 02:02:23.522]  And I can only imagine on both sides probably happening, you know, both ways, similar to what's happened to, you know, the young Arab kids in the Middle East where they're taught to hate America from a very young age.
[02:02:23.982 --> 02:02:38.231]  And they're just grown up in this propaganda mind control system where, you know, now they've got their hands on a Russian and they think they're doing the best thing in the world by blowing these young guys' genitals off and then calling them mothers and bragging about it.
[02:02:38.732 --> 02:02:41.690]   I mean, It's not where did they find these people.
[02:02:42.210 --> 02:02:43.031]  They created them.
[02:02:43.492 --> 02:02:53.705]  These people have been literally created by this propaganda and mind control and all of this crazy, crazy stuff that's been going on to them probably since they're young kids.
[02:02:53.765 --> 02:02:55.287]  I wanted to see what you thought about that.
[02:02:56.468 --> 02:02:57.789]  You need a radio talk show, brother.
[02:02:57.809 --> 02:02:58.690]  You said it better than I could.
[02:02:58.730 --> 02:02:58.890]  No.
[02:02:59.250 --> 02:03:10.116]  They are products of George Soros and the New World Order, using fissures from World War II and Nazi ideology to start a war with Russia, and now Putin's taking the bait, and God knows what's going to happen.
[02:03:10.417 --> 02:03:11.617]  What do you think should have come out of this?
[02:03:11.657 --> 02:03:12.478]  You sound pretty smart.
[02:03:14.049 --> 02:03:16.992]  I just think it's a horrible situation on both sides.
[02:03:17.493 --> 02:03:19.414]  I don't think anything good is coming out of it.
[02:03:19.454 --> 02:03:31.225]  I think like we've heard on the reporting of food shortages and possibly escalations to other conflicts either there or in the surrounding region.
[02:03:31.625 --> 02:03:43.957]   And I hope that we don't get dragged into it, but with the puppet Biden You know, walking around, uh, making all kinds of crazy, crazy claims every time somebody puts a microphone in front of his face.
[02:03:44.477 --> 02:03:45.859]  Who knows what we're heading for?
[02:03:45.959 --> 02:03:49.664]  And like you say, they got these submarines, uh, sitting off the coast.
[02:03:50.347 --> 02:03:55.750]  I'm here in New York City, and like you said, in five minutes, ten minutes, they could just vaporize the whole city.
[02:03:56.190 --> 02:03:57.251]  Yeah, so what?
[02:03:57.271 --> 02:04:00.093]  We have 6,000 nukes, and they have 5,000 nukes.
[02:04:00.273 --> 02:04:02.314]  All it takes is one or two, you know?
[02:04:02.514 --> 02:04:03.755]  It's total insanity.
[02:04:03.815 --> 02:04:07.397]  It's totally, and like, Biden's just bumbling around, bumbling Biden.
[02:04:07.477 --> 02:04:08.278]  It's very frightening.
[02:04:09.478 --> 02:04:22.095]   I'd love to see someone, maybe this Pete Doocy kid from Fox, or somebody that has a pair, You know, ask him in one of these briefings and say, you know, Biden, who's actually running things?
[02:04:22.215 --> 02:04:30.639]  Because every time you make a statement, immediately within hours, someone from your administration makes a statement contradicting exactly what you said.
[02:04:30.939 --> 02:04:31.920]  So who's in charge?
[02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:32.920]  Are you in charge?
[02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:34.981]  Or is your administration in charge?
[02:04:35.141 --> 02:04:36.302]  Who's running the show here?
[02:04:36.342 --> 02:04:44.123]   Because we are the ones dealing with the fallout from every one of these bad decisions and bad posturing. Well that's it and that's what's crazy is
[02:04:44.123 --> 02:04:48.644]   even if they put him in as a puppet he's an out of control puppet it's so dangerous. Mike,
[02:04:48.644 --> 02:04:52.313]   amazing information. Thank you so much for calling. That's why I love taking calls. What a great
[02:04:52.313 --> 02:04:54.722]  caller. Let's go to another awesome caller.
[02:04:54.722 --> 02:04:59.842]   Let's go to Melissa in San Diego, California. Go ahead, Melissa. Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:05:00.087 --> 02:05:02.569]  I've been a long-time listener, first-time caller.
[02:05:03.289 --> 02:05:05.471]  I agree with you on everything as far as when it comes to COVID.
[02:05:05.491 --> 02:05:09.154]  Let's hold all these people accountable, Fauci, the administration, the media, and so on.
[02:05:09.474 --> 02:05:13.037]  But there's one group that I think we keep forgetting about, and that's the union.
[02:05:13.417 --> 02:05:21.103]  The unions absolutely sold out their membership in order to be complicit with this entire charade, with the entire vaccine rollout.
[02:05:21.123 --> 02:05:21.623]  I agree with you.
[02:05:21.663 --> 02:05:24.926]  Where are they standing up for their members that you've got to take an experimental shot?
[02:05:25.246 --> 02:05:25.867]  That's ridiculous.
[02:05:25.887 --> 02:05:27.488]  That's the first thing unions should be doing.
[02:05:28.658 --> 02:05:28.958]  Correct.
[02:05:28.978 --> 02:05:37.847]  The largest federal employees union in the nation told their membership the president has an absolute right to force an experimental vaccine on you.
[02:05:37.887 --> 02:05:40.170]  We have no legal ground to fight it.
[02:05:40.210 --> 02:05:43.833]  Well that's why the globalists first took over the unions in the 50s and 60s.
[02:05:44.474 --> 02:05:52.322]  A union can be good or bad, it's just people, but they definitely feared the power of the people and their collective bargaining rights and they've totally shut it down.
[02:05:53.339 --> 02:05:53.599]  Correct.
[02:05:53.639 --> 02:06:03.781]  They've gotten so far away from actually doing what's right for the membership, the employees, the people who are actually working, and they're absolutely beholden to the Democrat Party and this whole New World Order.
[02:06:03.801 --> 02:06:05.762]  Which has offshored all their jobs.
[02:06:06.322 --> 02:06:16.264]  I mean, the unions oversee the destruction of their employees now, but they'll give them a little piece of meat up front, like, I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna bankrupt you, but here, here's a cigarette.
[02:06:17.145 --> 02:06:17.465]  Correct.
[02:06:17.786 --> 02:06:18.306]  Correct.
[02:06:18.466 --> 02:06:22.330]  And it's just amazing to me that people aren't awake to that fact.
[02:06:22.350 --> 02:06:28.296]  But again, my main point is we have to hold the unions accountable just like we're holding everybody else accountable.
[02:06:28.637 --> 02:06:33.702]  At the end of the day, they played a vital role in getting employees to roll over and take that shot.
[02:06:33.782 --> 02:06:37.345]  They coursed their membership to take that shot along with everybody else.
[02:06:38.266 --> 02:06:38.947]  Beautifully said.
[02:06:39.007 --> 02:06:39.788]  Anything else, Melissa?
[02:06:40.566 --> 02:06:41.727]  Yeah, just real quick.
[02:06:41.847 --> 02:06:47.372]  I know just a few minutes ago you were stating God keeps you on empty to keep you going, and I just wanted to reaffirm that for you.
[02:06:47.673 --> 02:06:48.393]  Absolutely He does.
[02:06:48.914 --> 02:06:56.841]  And at the end of the day, God just wants you and everyone else to know that it was Him who provided, it was Him who moved His hand that allowed us to continue to persevere.
[02:06:56.861 --> 02:07:02.006]  But I do pray for you, I pray for your family, that God continues to give you the strength and the fortitude to continue to fight the enemy.
[02:07:02.861 --> 02:07:05.769]  Well, I read the Widow's Might story, and then I live that every day.
[02:07:05.829 --> 02:07:08.216]  It's like, why is it exactly what we need?
[02:07:08.397 --> 02:07:11.184]  It's all, you know, it's like, that's God letting you know, isn't it?
[02:07:12.239 --> 02:07:18.444]  It is, and it's to keep us craving more, and to keep us wanting to seek Him more, so that He can give us exactly what we need.
[02:07:18.744 --> 02:07:23.228]  God will always come through, even if it's on the 11th hour, you know, the last minute, the last second.
[02:07:23.288 --> 02:07:27.992]  And I do believe God, all of these things are happening in the world today, from the vaccines, to the war, and all these things.
[02:07:28.392 --> 02:07:30.594]  God can change it in a heartbeat, and I believe He will.
[02:07:30.894 --> 02:07:34.777]  But when He does do it, it's going to be so the entire world will know He did it.
[02:07:34.998 --> 02:07:38.580]  It wasn't a politician, it wasn't a media group, or anyone else.
[02:07:38.660 --> 02:07:41.623]  It was Him who changed it, and He will hold all of these people accountable.
[02:07:42.546 --> 02:07:43.046]  I agree with you.
[02:07:43.487 --> 02:07:45.028]  Your words bring tears to my eyes, Melissa.
[02:07:45.068 --> 02:07:45.408]  Thank you.
[02:07:45.909 --> 02:07:47.089]  I've seen the power of God.
[02:07:48.210 --> 02:07:49.051]  I've seen the mysteries.
[02:07:49.591 --> 02:07:50.892]  I've seen it all stacked up.
[02:07:50.952 --> 02:07:52.994]  I've seen it up one side and down the other.
[02:07:53.014 --> 02:07:53.574]  It's amazing.
[02:07:54.155 --> 02:07:55.796]  All right, let's jam in a few more here.
[02:07:56.356 --> 02:08:00.479]  Let's talk to Presley in North Carolina, then William in Florida.
[02:08:00.499 --> 02:08:01.040]  Go ahead, Presley.
[02:08:02.481 --> 02:08:10.847]  Yes, I just wanted to call in and just let out an idea to everybody that I'm personally going to do myself as soon as I get my worthless refund.
[02:08:12.018 --> 02:08:20.785]  I'm gonna personally donate all of it to InfoWars to help y'all out, because if we don't do anything to stop this, that money's gonna be worth toilet paper.
[02:08:21.005 --> 02:08:28.911]   Well, brother, I appreciate you, but what makes me mad is folks of meager means that are hardworking Americans are giving everything, and there's all these rich people I know Exactly.
[02:08:29.011 --> 02:08:29.932]  Put up or shut up.
[02:08:29.752 --> 02:08:33.312]  They just sit on the sidelines while everything falls apart.
[02:08:33.312 --> 02:08:38.191]   So I just call on upper middle class wealthy people to start donating or do their own damn
[02:08:38.191 --> 02:08:42.552]   show but whatever they do they need to put some skin in the game right now.
[02:08:42.552 --> 02:08:46.032]  Exactly, put up or shut up.
[02:08:46.032 --> 02:08:48.752]  When can we expect COVID-land 3 man?
[02:08:48.752 --> 02:08:53.111]   As soon as they get it done and we're voicing it and getting it out, we'll get it out.
[02:08:53.187 --> 02:08:54.347]  Folks put a lot of money into it.
[02:08:54.407 --> 02:08:55.027]  Big production.
[02:08:55.047 --> 02:08:56.088]  It hasn't made its money back.
[02:08:57.128 --> 02:09:01.649]  We just did the promotion and some of the advertising, but we've almost lost money on it.
[02:09:01.929 --> 02:09:05.730]  The makers of it have lost money, but it's a very important two-part series.
[02:09:05.770 --> 02:09:07.050]  The rest of the series are coming out.
[02:09:07.610 --> 02:09:11.091]  What matters is that millions have watched it online for free.
[02:09:12.378 --> 02:09:14.300]  God bless you, and keep up the good work, man.
[02:09:14.561 --> 02:09:15.622]  We're all in this together.
[02:09:15.842 --> 02:09:16.282]  Yes, sir.
[02:09:16.703 --> 02:09:17.464]  No, that's what we do.
[02:09:17.504 --> 02:09:24.952]  You know, most of our projects, we do a lot of stuff, and we just try to pick the right things to fight the enemy, and then we try to get the funds.
[02:09:25.012 --> 02:09:30.478]  And used to, I could fund all sorts of journalists, all sorts of films, and we were doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes.
[02:09:30.518 --> 02:09:32.400]  We're now imploded down to Infowars.
[02:09:33.061 --> 02:09:41.329]  And we still have a great effect here, but it's just every day is precious because the enemy is coming after us big time.
[02:09:41.349 --> 02:09:42.670]  We're going to start the next hour.
[02:09:42.690 --> 02:09:43.811]  I'm going to let Gerald take over.
[02:09:43.831 --> 02:09:44.672]  It's six after.
[02:09:45.273 --> 02:09:46.434]  I'm not going to cut it his time.
[02:09:46.454 --> 02:09:47.555]  I didn't hit.
[02:09:48.649 --> 02:10:11.037]  The crime wave news, and I didn't hit the economy news, I didn't hit the BlackRock bragging about world government news, but I'm going to set those stacks aside, and tomorrow there'll be even more stuff I can add to it, and I'm going to start the show with the collapse of the economy by design, how to stop it, BlackRock, Bill Gates, and all the rest of it, so that's coming up.
[02:10:12.930 --> 02:10:21.794]  You know, I'm always trying to figure out, what do I sell to listeners that's good, that makes their life better, that they like, that's reasonably priced, to keep us on the air?
[02:10:22.855 --> 02:10:25.096]  And then I'm like, man, I don't want to get up here and ask for stuff.
[02:10:25.116 --> 02:10:26.376]  I don't want to get up here and sell products.
[02:10:27.097 --> 02:10:28.377]  But if I don't, we'll be off the air.
[02:10:29.197 --> 02:10:30.758]  So it's a very simple equation.
[02:10:31.679 --> 02:10:37.881]  And I know my job is just to do this as hard as I can to the end, and then God will pick up the slack.
[02:10:40.134 --> 02:10:48.081]  We've reached our most important work in our history in 28 years and people are really listening now and very important people are listening.
[02:10:48.421 --> 02:10:49.582]  Common people are important.
[02:10:50.083 --> 02:10:51.544]  Very powerful people are important.
[02:10:51.564 --> 02:10:52.104]  They're listening.
[02:10:53.325 --> 02:10:56.028]  And we're just, we've hit what we were made for.
[02:10:56.068 --> 02:10:57.929]  We've come into our prime.
[02:10:57.969 --> 02:10:58.570]  We're here.
[02:10:58.810 --> 02:11:01.673]  This is, everything we did was pointing towards this moment.
[02:11:02.193 --> 02:11:08.098]  So, your word of mouth, your prayers, you're visiting Infowarsstore.com or 1776coin.com.
[02:11:08.558 --> 02:11:12.101]  That is what funds the revolution against tyranny.
[02:11:12.181 --> 02:11:14.122]  That's what overrides the evil.
[02:11:14.983 --> 02:11:16.404]  Gas prices explode.
[02:11:16.504 --> 02:11:17.905]  Food prices explode.
[02:11:18.305 --> 02:11:19.666]  Illegal immigration explodes.
[02:11:19.806 --> 02:11:20.347]  Wokeness.
[02:11:20.487 --> 02:11:20.947]  China.
[02:11:21.107 --> 02:11:21.688]  Taliban.
[02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:24.450]  All of the tyranny.
[02:11:26.051 --> 02:11:27.632]  And Gerald Salenta is going to take over in 15 minutes.
[02:11:29.315 --> 02:11:43.759]  I've got one more caller, William, I'm going to get to, but big news just broke at InfoWars.com that we have been consistently warning of over and over again, that is such a critical thing.
[02:11:43.779 --> 02:11:53.181]  And when you see Sean Hannity, he gives you a tell when he explains that, and he's in sync with the Deep State and the warmongers.
[02:11:53.221 --> 02:11:53.962]  So that's coming up.
[02:11:56.847 --> 02:12:01.247]   Special report dealing with this and we're gonna come back in the next segment hit it all stay with us
[02:12:01.247 --> 02:12:14.207]   June the 6th 1944 the allies begin an invasion of Nazi-controlled France
[02:12:14.207 --> 02:12:24.527]   The Western world after World War two had a baby boom and our populations in Europe
[02:12:25.448 --> 02:12:27.448]  Australia, New Zealand, Canada.
[02:12:27.178 --> 02:12:28.499]  The U.S.
[02:12:28.599 --> 02:12:31.461]  doubled on average in the next 30 years.
[02:12:32.042 --> 02:12:35.784]  And now we have the biggest aged population in the world.
[02:12:35.844 --> 02:12:39.507]  Same numbers for Japan and China as well.
[02:12:40.652 --> 02:12:42.235]  China's more than doubled its population.
[02:12:42.777 --> 02:12:44.620]  To one point, almost five billion.
[02:12:45.081 --> 02:12:45.803]  India's the same.
[02:12:46.464 --> 02:12:51.014]  And so, there's been a decision by BlackRock on record, and Bill Gates has given speeches at TED Talks.
[02:12:51.645 --> 02:12:55.225]  about this to just kill people at age 75.
[02:12:55.225 --> 02:12:59.725]   Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient,
[02:12:59.725 --> 02:13:07.125]   would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade off in medical costs?
[02:13:07.125 --> 02:13:11.524]   But that's called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[02:13:11.524 --> 02:13:17.625]   The main author of Obamacare, Ezekiel Emanuel, Rahm Emanuel's brother,
[02:13:17.625 --> 02:13:24.125]   has written essays and articles about how he hopes to die at 75.
[02:13:24.125 --> 02:13:26.646]  By the way, he's past 75 and hasn't died.
[02:13:26.966 --> 02:13:29.387]  He means he wants you to die at 75.
[02:13:30.087 --> 02:13:32.047]  They can't pay you your pension funds.
[02:13:32.128 --> 02:13:33.228]  They've stolen the money.
[02:13:33.408 --> 02:13:35.108]  And they don't want to go to jail like Bernie Madoff.
[02:13:35.168 --> 02:13:36.149]  They want you to die.
[02:13:36.529 --> 02:13:38.889]  And then it's trendy to eat bugs and all the rest of it.
[02:13:39.149 --> 02:13:40.450]  You're not saving the earth.
[02:13:41.738 --> 02:13:52.408]  You're letting the globalists train you to be a slave as they prepare to cut off the resources, make you fight over the resources, and then phase you out and get rid of you.
[02:13:52.688 --> 02:13:55.591]  And yeah, Joe will tell you, he didn't know what he was doing back on the Fear Factor.
[02:13:55.611 --> 02:13:59.234]  Joe Rogan, that was all conditioning too, to get people to dehumanize themselves.
[02:14:00.716 --> 02:14:05.260]  This is a long-term, anti-human, alien agenda.
[02:14:06.061 --> 02:14:09.123]  And by alien, all of this is alien to the normal way of life.
[02:14:09.603 --> 02:14:12.784]  All of this is anti-human, anti-life on this planet.
[02:14:13.025 --> 02:14:14.605]  The globalists don't want to just get rid of humans.
[02:14:14.625 --> 02:14:16.046]  They want the whole thing taken over.
[02:14:16.506 --> 02:14:17.827]  A silicon-based system.
[02:14:18.107 --> 02:14:20.068]  This is an alien takeover.
[02:14:20.568 --> 02:14:21.909]  This is the fight of our lives.
[02:14:21.969 --> 02:14:24.891]  This is the enemy of our generation that we face.
[02:14:26.732 --> 02:14:29.393]  And their new world order is a place that we don't even exist in.
[02:14:30.578 --> 02:14:34.267]  And in the process of being destroyed and killed, we're gonna go through hell!
[02:14:34.387 --> 02:14:35.250]  And our children are!
[02:14:35.610 --> 02:14:37.134]  Are we really gonna lie down and take this?
[02:14:37.355 --> 02:14:39.079]  Are we really gonna see hundreds of articles?
[02:14:40.965 --> 02:14:49.651]  In Bloomberg, and in Reuters, and in the New York Times, and in local magazines for kids in public schools for elementary kids.
[02:14:49.992 --> 02:14:51.413]  Save the Earth, eat maggots.
[02:14:51.933 --> 02:14:53.214]  Save the Earth, drink sewage.
[02:14:53.254 --> 02:14:55.836]  Save the Earth, euthanize your dog or cat.
[02:14:55.896 --> 02:14:56.857]  Don't take care of them.
[02:14:57.277 --> 02:14:58.318]  This is dystopia.
[02:14:58.358 --> 02:15:04.462]  They're attacking you with poison, with garbage, with lies, with big pharma, with poison shots.
[02:15:06.063 --> 02:15:07.164]  Or maybe I've just been wrong.
[02:15:07.184 --> 02:15:16.025]   Maybe I should submit And maybe we should all go out today with hatchets and kill our dogs in the backyards and our cats.
[02:15:16.745 --> 02:15:18.488]  Because it's to save the earth, right?
[02:15:18.728 --> 02:15:21.151]  We're supposed to give up everything we've got because we're bad.
[02:15:21.391 --> 02:15:22.933]  We're guilty because we have dogs and cats.
[02:15:23.154 --> 02:15:24.475]  We're guilty because we have children.
[02:15:24.515 --> 02:15:24.896]  We're evil.
[02:15:25.036 --> 02:15:26.157]  But none of that's even true!
[02:15:27.842 --> 02:15:35.184]  It's all a greedy group of monsters that want you to learn to hate yourself so you roll over into the ditch of history so they can steal the future.
[02:15:35.344 --> 02:15:45.067]  They're projecting their globalist hatred of themselves onto you and I. All the beautiful, nice things they have and the science they have came from the commoners, came from the people.
[02:15:45.107 --> 02:15:46.267]  We built all this.
[02:15:46.888 --> 02:15:53.230]  And now they've got their robots coming online and they say they don't need us anymore and we're supposed to just hate ourselves and go commit collective suicide.
[02:15:53.390 --> 02:15:53.830]  Well, guess what?
[02:15:53.650 --> 02:16:05.850]  This one is not going to happen.
[02:16:05.888 --> 02:16:06.708]  Info Wars.
[02:16:07.208 --> 02:16:09.409]  Because there's a war on, for your mind.
[02:16:11.010 --> 02:16:12.491]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:16:12.691 --> 02:16:18.714]  Well, we knew this was coming, and now it's been announced by the Ukrainian government, the globalist system.
[02:16:19.774 --> 02:16:23.156]  They say the Russians are going to stage a dirty bomb.
[02:16:25.333 --> 02:16:27.734]  So they need NATO to come in right now and occupy the country.
[02:16:27.754 --> 02:16:32.777]  They need the UN to come in right now and fight the Russians, which will start a larger war.
[02:16:34.218 --> 02:16:39.121]  They're saying that radioactive material has been stolen from some of the nuclear power plants.
[02:16:39.941 --> 02:16:44.404]  The nuclear power plants, they said three weeks ago, the Russians had blown up.
[02:16:47.261 --> 02:16:55.685]  Now, the Russian ambassador came out two weeks ago, almost three weeks ago, and said, they're going to claim we're going to stage a dirty bomb.
[02:16:56.165 --> 02:16:57.065]  It's not true.
[02:16:57.705 --> 02:16:59.186]  Why would you stage a dirty bomb?
[02:16:59.746 --> 02:17:00.927]  That brings the West in.
[02:17:00.987 --> 02:17:02.808]  That brings... No, you don't want that.
[02:17:03.608 --> 02:17:06.309]  That's why Putin's not been trying to target civilian forces.
[02:17:07.430 --> 02:17:13.312]  Because he doesn't want to be known as a war criminal, as the Ukrainians are now being known as they commit the atrocities.
[02:17:13.912 --> 02:17:14.953]  That's how you lose wars.
[02:17:16.425 --> 02:17:19.606]  Kellan McBrain has written about it for InfoWars.com.
[02:17:21.747 --> 02:17:27.089]  Kellan a month ago began writing about the Hunter Biden connection to the bioweapon labs, which are now confirmed.
[02:17:28.370 --> 02:17:29.210]  False flag alert!
[02:17:30.050 --> 02:17:33.892]  Ukraine claims dirty bomb ingredients stolen from Chernobyl!
[02:17:34.052 --> 02:17:35.032]  That's right!
[02:17:35.853 --> 02:17:38.454]  And the Russkies are gonna release it!
[02:17:40.925 --> 02:17:56.674]  Ukraine's director of the Institute for Safety Problems of Nuclear Power Plants, the ISPNPP, Anatoly Noskovaly, is warning looters allegedly stole radioactive isotopes that can be used to make a dirty bomb.
[02:17:58.094 --> 02:17:59.155]  He has no proof of the claims.
[02:17:59.535 --> 02:18:07.700]  He says since Russia has gained control of Chernobyl monitoring lab, the fate of these sources of radioactive isotopes is unknown to us.
[02:18:09.468 --> 02:18:16.231]  And it goes on with the news saying, oh my gosh, break for it.
[02:18:16.811 --> 02:18:18.512]  All your rights are about to taken away.
[02:18:18.552 --> 02:18:24.655]  We've got to go to war with Russia because they are going to set off a dirty bomb.
[02:18:26.595 --> 02:18:27.896]  And that's what Sean Hannity said.
[02:18:28.776 --> 02:18:29.517]  We played it earlier.
[02:18:29.577 --> 02:18:35.519]  He said, listen, they're going to release a dirty bomb or a radiation bomb or a biological bomb or a chemical bomb.
[02:18:35.879 --> 02:18:37.140]  And we can't be scared.
[02:18:39.599 --> 02:18:41.260]  To go to nuclear war with them when they do that.
[02:18:41.300 --> 02:18:41.821]  Here's the quote.
[02:18:42.121 --> 02:18:44.523]  Hannity, nuke Russia off the face of the earth.
[02:18:44.563 --> 02:18:45.084]  That's a quote.
[02:18:45.544 --> 02:18:47.986]  If they use WMDs, but we don't know they did.
[02:18:48.286 --> 02:18:49.087]  Somebody claims it did.
[02:18:49.347 --> 02:18:55.492]  We can't cower in fear over mutually assured destruction.
[02:18:58.915 --> 02:19:02.778]  All I can say is, wow, wow, and wow again.
[02:19:03.679 --> 02:19:06.001]  What a time to be alive.
[02:19:10.543 --> 02:19:16.289]  You can just smell the doom and all the economic news of the hyperinflation and everything coming up.
[02:19:18.471 --> 02:19:19.672]  All done by the central banks.
[02:19:20.373 --> 02:19:22.775]  I'd love to blame the Russians because we could fix that problem.
[02:19:23.456 --> 02:19:24.997]  The Russians don't run our country.
[02:19:25.297 --> 02:19:27.479]  What's scary is Larry Fink does.
[02:19:28.305 --> 02:19:29.486]  And Larry Fink's a jerk.
[02:19:30.246 --> 02:19:31.887]  Larry Fink loves Communist China.
[02:19:32.147 --> 02:19:33.488]  Larry Fink is a tyrant.
[02:19:33.708 --> 02:19:37.611]  He funds Black Lives Matter and drag queen pedo story time.
[02:19:37.891 --> 02:19:39.792]  Yeah, let's play a clip of him before I go to this last caller.
[02:19:40.493 --> 02:19:58.545]   This is him again on Bloomberg bragging that hedge funds and investment funds like his, the biggest in the world, over 10 trillion in assets, prefer dictators To the messiness of free countries, here it is.
[02:20:00.405 --> 02:20:01.085]  Uncertainty.
[02:20:01.245 --> 02:20:02.606]  Markets don't like uncertainty.
[02:20:02.786 --> 02:20:15.409]  Markets like, actually, totalitarian governments where you have a understanding of what's out there and obviously the whole dimension is changing now with, as you said, a democratization of countries.
[02:20:15.489 --> 02:20:18.830]  And democracies are very messy, as we know in the United States.
[02:20:19.630 --> 02:20:21.851]  You have opinions changing back and forth.
[02:20:23.080 --> 02:20:24.400]  But those really aren't democracies.
[02:20:24.441 --> 02:20:25.621]  Those are color revolutions.
[02:20:25.661 --> 02:20:30.423]  Their funding and their fomenting is the operative word.
[02:20:30.463 --> 02:20:36.285]  Let's jam in one final caller before the great trends forecaster, Gerald Celente, takes over.
[02:20:36.365 --> 02:20:37.885]  Let's talk to William in Florida.
[02:20:38.326 --> 02:20:38.926]  Welcome, sir.
[02:20:40.666 --> 02:20:41.067]  Hey, Alex.
[02:20:41.087 --> 02:20:41.847]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:20:42.227 --> 02:20:42.547]  Yes, sir.
[02:20:42.567 --> 02:20:44.808]  I just wanted to talk about the election fraud.
[02:20:44.948 --> 02:20:47.249]  And Stuart Varney had Trump on the other day.
[02:20:48.511 --> 02:20:53.874]  And when Trump brought up the election of 2020, he criticized them about looking in the past.
[02:20:54.995 --> 02:21:00.858]  The very next day he has Greg Gutfeld on just to criticize Trump about looking into the past.
[02:21:01.219 --> 02:21:05.441]  Oh yeah, you're not supposed to look at fraud because you're supposed to let them keep doing it forever.
[02:21:07.723 --> 02:21:07.963]  Right.
[02:21:08.143 --> 02:21:11.225]  I mean, it's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard of.
[02:21:11.265 --> 02:21:14.807]  It's maybe the biggest travesty in American history and they don't even want to look at it.
[02:21:15.390 --> 02:21:18.037]  Well that's because there's a litmus test with all these big corporations.
[02:21:18.378 --> 02:21:20.524]  You don't talk about the election fraud.
[02:21:20.945 --> 02:21:23.772]  That's persona non grata because obviously Trump won the election.
[02:21:25.365 --> 02:21:25.585]  Right.
[02:21:25.825 --> 02:21:28.606]  I mean, in AG Bar, he did nothing about it.
[02:21:28.966 --> 02:21:32.907]  Now he's complaining about Biden lied and Hannity complains about Biden.
[02:21:33.307 --> 02:21:34.788]  He didn't want to look in the election.
[02:21:35.428 --> 02:21:36.828]  It's disgusting.
[02:21:37.349 --> 02:21:43.310]  But I would love for you to do like a documentary and step by step and just lay it out so people can actually see it.
[02:21:43.330 --> 02:21:53.766]   Because I'm amazed that some of my friends don't even realize All the anomalies, all the, you know, all the six bellwether counties stopped counting at the exact same time.
[02:21:54.126 --> 02:21:55.746]  Oh, it wasn't just six counties.
[02:21:55.806 --> 02:21:58.127]  It was a bunch of states did the same.
[02:21:58.207 --> 02:22:00.368]  And the Democrats said there'll be a red mirage.
[02:22:00.768 --> 02:22:04.149]  It'll look like he's winning, but we'll get the mail-ins later.
[02:22:04.690 --> 02:22:07.250]  And Pelosi said no matter what it takes, he's gone.
[02:22:08.771 --> 02:22:08.971]  Right.
[02:22:09.171 --> 02:22:11.572]  So I'm sure somebody was coordinating that.
[02:22:12.393 --> 02:22:17.618]  And it needs to be looked into, and when Trump gets back in, he's got a real... Wait a minute, you think fish swim in the sea?
[02:22:20.501 --> 02:22:21.261]  I'm sorry, what's that?
[02:22:21.482 --> 02:22:22.983]  Well you said you're sure there was fraud.
[02:22:23.023 --> 02:22:26.186]  You mean you think the sky's blue and fish swim in the ocean?
[02:22:26.226 --> 02:22:27.127]  That's insane.
[02:22:28.408 --> 02:22:29.489]  I know, it's crazy.
[02:22:30.210 --> 02:22:33.593]  But I just hope Trump gets back in and has a real A.G.
[02:22:33.653 --> 02:22:34.914]  and this can...
[02:22:36.039 --> 02:22:43.282]  I mean, I don't think nothing's going to be changed about restoring the election, but at least uncovering all the anomalies so it never happens in the future.
[02:22:43.302 --> 02:22:44.943]  Because I don't feel good about voting now.
[02:22:46.724 --> 02:22:48.525]  How do I know they're not going to do the same thing?
[02:22:48.605 --> 02:22:51.026]  Well, they have big trouble stealing landslides.
[02:22:51.046 --> 02:22:52.286]  That's why he won the first time.
[02:22:52.947 --> 02:22:55.068]  But they barely were able to steal this one.
[02:22:55.168 --> 02:22:56.608]  And so all eyes are on it.
[02:22:57.129 --> 02:23:00.210]  So I would say keep voting, but keep exposing the fraud while you do it.
[02:23:00.710 --> 02:23:01.791]  But great points, William.
[02:23:01.831 --> 02:23:02.251]  Anything else?
[02:23:04.426 --> 02:23:06.628]  I would love for you, like I said, just to do a documentary.
[02:23:06.668 --> 02:23:12.473]  I think you'd raise a lot of money for InfoWars and keep your thing going, and you're doing a great job.
[02:23:14.075 --> 02:23:25.665]  I mean, it's just such an important topic, and when you get all these guys on Fox complaining about Biden, yet they never even wanted to discuss the stolen election, it's just ridiculous.
[02:23:25.945 --> 02:23:26.906]  I mean, useless.
[02:23:27.467 --> 02:23:28.147]  Well said, sir.
[02:23:28.207 --> 02:23:28.548]  Thank you.
[02:23:29.744 --> 02:23:34.029]  Alright, Gerald Cilente is always incredibly informative and on fire and interesting.
[02:23:34.069 --> 02:23:35.831]  He's about to take over and let's have this break.
[02:23:36.592 --> 02:23:41.078]  I don't personally like to spend my time both plugging and begging for support.
[02:23:42.399 --> 02:23:43.941]  If we don't do it, we won't be here.
[02:23:44.927 --> 02:23:47.448]  So it's really just that simple.
[02:23:47.888 --> 02:23:48.568]  Do or die.
[02:23:49.108 --> 02:23:50.709]  We want to keep InfoWars on air.
[02:23:51.289 --> 02:23:52.029]  And it's real simple.
[02:23:52.089 --> 02:23:52.749]  Go buy a book.
[02:23:52.890 --> 02:23:53.650]  Buy some films.
[02:23:54.130 --> 02:23:55.110]  We got a big sale.
[02:23:55.150 --> 02:23:57.911]  Some of the t-shirts are selling at cost or even lower.
[02:23:58.431 --> 02:23:59.472]  Up to 75% off.
[02:23:59.512 --> 02:24:01.072]  We got to have a big clearance right now.
[02:24:01.632 --> 02:24:02.913]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:24:03.393 --> 02:24:06.114]  And then we have 1776Coin.com.
[02:24:07.394 --> 02:24:07.774]  That is 10,000.
[02:24:07.934 --> 02:24:09.975]  It's the second and the third series.
[02:24:09.995 --> 02:24:13.296]  So 30,000 coins total of the founders series.
[02:24:14.383 --> 02:24:22.257]  With a coin I designed with another top designer of, the tree of liberty must be watered from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[02:24:23.768 --> 02:24:26.768]   It's got the Tree of Liberty, it's got the skull, it's just really historic.
[02:24:26.768 --> 02:24:30.808]   And then the markup that's in the coin, it's a great collectible, keeps us on air and lets
[02:24:30.808 --> 02:24:34.968]   us launch a lot of new cool things behind the scenes that the folks that buy the coin
[02:24:34.968 --> 02:24:37.768]  will exclusively be given access to.
[02:24:37.768 --> 02:24:39.048]  And we're very, very close to it.
[02:24:39.048 --> 02:24:41.486]  So I want to thank everybody that's part of this.
[02:24:41.486 --> 02:24:44.768]  Infowarsstore.com has a big link on the front page.
[02:24:44.768 --> 02:24:52.327]  Or simply, ladies and gentlemen, you can go to 1776coin.com.
[02:24:52.414 --> 02:24:52.794]  1-7-7-6.
[02:24:55.056 --> 02:24:56.857]  1776coin.com.
[02:24:57.598 --> 02:24:59.819]  And the limited edition coin is available.
[02:25:00.300 --> 02:25:03.062]  And last time it sold out in about nine and a half days, ten days.
[02:25:03.722 --> 02:25:06.304]  It's scheduled to sell out exactly the same this time.
[02:25:06.884 --> 02:25:10.867]  And we held back 200 of the original George Washington Slam the Dragon coin.
[02:25:11.427 --> 02:25:14.570]  So we're going to be offering 50 of those a day, randomly.
[02:25:14.830 --> 02:25:19.153]   You'll see it pop up at 1776coin.com or patriotcollectibles.com.
[02:25:19.473 --> 02:25:30.882]  So if you want one of those coins at the original price, even though they're selling for two or three times that now on eBay and other places, those are available as well at 1776coin.com.
[02:25:31.263 --> 02:25:32.804]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.

[02:25:41.790 --> 02:25:42.790]  Thank you for your support.
[02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:54.790]  [Music]
[02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:58.790]   You know, it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true,
[02:25:58.790 --> 02:26:03.790]   that InfoWars is seen by the globalists as the standard of human liberty,
[02:26:03.790 --> 02:26:11.790]   as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist, anti-human program.
[02:26:12.438 --> 02:26:19.500]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:26.361]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them, at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:26:26.401 --> 02:26:29.082]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[02:26:29.502 --> 02:26:33.963]  And so now we need the support more than ever because this fight has intensified.
[02:26:34.023 --> 02:26:35.063]  Don't need me to tell you that.
[02:26:36.260 --> 02:26:37.700]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:39.421]  I'm very grateful to be on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:41.699]  25% off across the board right now.
[02:26:41.699 --> 02:26:47.139]   Things have been sold out for a long time, like InfoWars Life, Fizzy Magnesium Mix that's so amazing,
[02:26:47.139 --> 02:26:50.619]  and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[02:26:50.619 --> 02:26:55.420]   They're all available 25 to 75% off at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[02:26:55.420 --> 02:26:57.660]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:57.660 --> 02:27:01.100]  I'm very grateful to be on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:01.100 --> 02:27:04.600]  And what Alex is saying is very important.
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:07.879]  InfoWars needs your support.
[02:27:08.514 --> 02:27:11.217]  And go back to when the COVID war began.
[02:27:11.237 --> 02:27:13.359]  It's about two years ago, a little more.
[02:27:14.580 --> 02:27:18.804]  And how everybody that came out against it and said, you know, this is a lot of baloney.
[02:27:19.244 --> 02:27:20.986]  You know, who's dying from this and why?
[02:27:21.006 --> 02:27:24.189]  And the facts again, totally ignored.
[02:27:24.829 --> 02:27:30.815]  You know, 2.94% of the people dying had 2.6 pre-existing comorbidities.
[02:27:32.020 --> 02:27:38.841]  The people 1 to 17 years old that died, about 693 over two years, 61% were obese.
[02:27:40.241 --> 02:27:44.942]  You know all the facts of who's dying and why, and you talked about it, they call you conspiracy theorists.
[02:27:46.223 --> 02:28:03.280]   And they're doing the same thing now of those of us that are calling for peace and to stop the Ukraine war, rather than the United States sending in more of our money So the killing could keep going on.
[02:28:04.020 --> 02:28:12.888]  Almost $20 billion of our bucks go into Ukraine to keep the war going.
[02:28:12.928 --> 02:28:14.749]  And again, I launched Occupy Peace.
[02:28:15.430 --> 02:28:18.252]  And as you see, you know, I put my money in my heart where my mouth is.
[02:28:19.053 --> 02:28:29.041]  Then we got this little freaky clown of a nobody, a little piece of garbage, nothing, a nothing of a boy, or maybe not.
[02:28:30.233 --> 02:28:40.556]  This Buddha gig, throwing out his BS that we're giving $2.9 billion to cities to help rebuild the infrastructure.
[02:28:40.576 --> 02:28:40.956]  $2.9 billion?
[02:28:40.996 --> 02:28:45.317]  How about throwing a dime on the streets to a homeless guy?
[02:28:46.257 --> 02:28:47.477]  That's what it adds up to.
[02:28:47.878 --> 02:28:53.079]  But hey, I can't use the word that I like to say.
[02:28:55.496 --> 02:28:58.837]  Look at this, look at this, look at this little nothing!
[02:28:59.437 --> 02:29:04.078]  Look at the crap shooting out of that little nothing's mouth!
[02:29:06.199 --> 02:29:16.481]  2.9 billion, well, almost 20 billion is going to the military-industrial complex to keep a losing war going.
[02:29:18.462 --> 02:29:19.822]  No talk about peace.
[02:29:20.602 --> 02:29:23.223]  Not a piece from the little prostitutes!
[02:29:24.262 --> 02:29:31.366]  Hey, Anderson Cooper, I remember when you went over there to Egypt when the, uh, when that war was starting over there.
[02:29:31.386 --> 02:29:32.986]  You remember the Arab Spring?
[02:29:33.427 --> 02:29:36.088]  Oh, and somebody hit you and you went home crying?
[02:29:36.108 --> 02:29:40.330]  A little daddy's girl, a little daddy's girl.
[02:29:40.530 --> 02:29:40.830]  Yeah.
[02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.730]  Oh, daddy's boy.
[02:29:41.771 --> 02:29:42.811]  No, mommy's boy.
[02:29:43.051 --> 02:29:43.511]  I forget.
[02:29:43.791 --> 02:29:44.672]  I get them mixed up.
[02:29:45.473 --> 02:29:48.175]  Oh, Mommy was Gloria Vanderbilt!
[02:29:48.675 --> 02:29:50.336]  You'd be nowhere!
[02:29:50.816 --> 02:29:52.757]  Nowhere, little boy!
[02:29:53.278 --> 02:29:53.978]  Go fight!
[02:29:54.278 --> 02:29:54.738]  Oh, oh!
[02:29:55.219 --> 02:29:59.141]  I just listened to Alex Jones talking about all that tough Hannity!
[02:29:59.161 --> 02:30:01.222]  Oh, we're gonna show her a fight!
[02:30:01.562 --> 02:30:01.822]  Hey!
[02:30:02.503 --> 02:30:03.223]  Hey, Hannity!
[02:30:04.084 --> 02:30:09.507]  Put on some military drag, grab your gun, and go lead the fight!
[02:30:10.464 --> 02:30:11.845]  You want to go fight?
[02:30:12.306 --> 02:30:14.828]  All you fat mouths that want to go fight?
[02:30:15.348 --> 02:30:16.669]  Line up and go fight.
[02:30:17.049 --> 02:30:17.830]  Hey, how?
[02:30:18.090 --> 02:30:19.291]  Oh, yeah, he'd fight.
[02:30:20.592 --> 02:30:22.093]  How about Joe Biden?
[02:30:22.414 --> 02:30:27.778]  Oh, tough Joe Biden talking out all that tough crap that keeps shooting out of his mouth.
[02:30:28.138 --> 02:30:35.184]  Oh, oh, here's the headline from yesterday's toilet paper, a record, the New York Slime.
[02:30:37.246 --> 02:30:39.908]  Biden says Putin cannot remain in power.
[02:30:41.004 --> 02:30:49.327]  Hey, hey, hey, Times, how about Putin says Biden can't remain in power?
[02:30:50.248 --> 02:31:03.793]  How about Putin says warmonger, murderous, lying piece of scum, George W. Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction.
[02:31:03.933 --> 02:31:07.475]  Bush cannot remain in power.
[02:31:08.235 --> 02:31:10.616]  Oh, he only killed, what, 800 and something thousand.
[02:31:12.455 --> 02:31:12.895]  Oh, oh.
[02:31:14.836 --> 02:31:17.117]  And all the garbage that they're throwing out there.
[02:31:17.177 --> 02:31:18.437]  Well, you know, the Russians.
[02:31:18.798 --> 02:31:19.318]  Oh, I love it.
[02:31:19.558 --> 02:31:19.998]  I love it.
[02:31:20.338 --> 02:31:26.160]  They bring on these intelligence experts and all these former generals and current generals.
[02:31:26.641 --> 02:31:28.561]  General pieces of scum.
[02:31:29.142 --> 02:31:32.723]  You guys haven't won a war since World War Two.
[02:31:33.003 --> 02:31:40.206]  So shove your crap down your mouth and don't tell me about Russia, what they're doing and who's going to happen and why.
[02:31:41.272 --> 02:31:44.754]  Oh, they've been there a month and they thought they were going to get there a lot faster.
[02:31:45.114 --> 02:31:48.475]  Hey, fat face, because that's what you guys look like.
[02:31:48.756 --> 02:31:50.616]  Oh, how about Mad Dog Mattis?
[02:31:50.917 --> 02:31:52.457]  He'd love to kill everybody.
[02:31:52.477 --> 02:31:54.398]  Oh, his words, not mine.
[02:31:56.759 --> 02:31:59.701]  You're in Afghanistan for 20 years.
[02:32:01.462 --> 02:32:06.244]  And you're talking about Russia being in fighting Ukraine for one month.
[02:32:09.873 --> 02:32:14.396]  How about that crown prince over there in Saudi Arabia?
[02:32:14.777 --> 02:32:22.282]  Oh yeah, the clown prince that everybody bowed down for when he came to the United States and started the Yemen war?
[02:32:24.133 --> 02:32:27.594]  The Yemen war where you have 3 million people that lost their homes?
[02:32:28.075 --> 02:32:30.536]  The worst humanitarian crisis on earth?
[02:32:31.076 --> 02:32:39.319]  Brought to you by the Nobel Peace or crap prize winner, Barack Obama, and that other little arrogant boy, Blinken.
[02:32:39.679 --> 02:32:41.060]  Blinken on nothing!
[02:32:41.790 --> 02:32:50.156]  Oh, yeah, he went over to Saudi Arabia when Saudi Arabia announced the war almost just about seven years ago to date from Washington, D.C.
[02:32:50.377 --> 02:32:56.501]  We're going to get them hooties out of there because, oh, they're close to Iran and we don't want them to be together.
[02:32:57.282 --> 02:32:57.542]  Yeah.
[02:32:57.782 --> 02:32:58.523]  Look at these guys.
[02:32:58.743 --> 02:32:59.363]  Can you imagine?
[02:32:59.483 --> 02:32:59.924]  General?
[02:33:00.484 --> 02:33:01.725]  Look at this guy.
[02:33:02.366 --> 02:33:03.707]  Look at this guy.
[02:33:06.509 --> 02:33:07.569]  Look at those eyes.
[02:33:08.890 --> 02:33:09.871]  Look at this nothing.
[02:33:10.412 --> 02:33:10.832]  Arrogance.
[02:33:11.460 --> 02:33:11.940]  Arrogance!
[02:33:13.320 --> 02:33:13.880]  Blinkin'.
[02:33:14.441 --> 02:33:16.441]  Blinkin' on zero, man!
[02:33:17.321 --> 02:33:20.462]  Oh, he said, he said, Russia's gonna lose this war.
[02:33:21.242 --> 02:33:21.442]  Yep.
[02:33:23.502 --> 02:33:24.762]  Look at all, look at all the drag.
[02:33:24.782 --> 02:33:26.483]  Look at all the military drag on there.
[02:33:26.683 --> 02:33:29.383]  Look at that stupid hand up there with the, with the, with, yeah.
[02:33:30.724 --> 02:33:38.865]  Look, look at, look at, look at who we got as the clown playing our health director, whatever they call him.
[02:33:40.494 --> 02:33:41.455]  Rachel Levin.
[02:33:43.635 --> 02:33:45.996]  You look at this thing dressed up in the Admiral.
[02:33:46.096 --> 02:33:46.856]  An Admiral?
[02:33:47.276 --> 02:33:48.737]  How about a Rear Admiral?
[02:33:51.017 --> 02:33:52.858]  You're not gonna beat the Russians.
[02:33:55.018 --> 02:33:55.658]  There we go.
[02:33:56.339 --> 02:34:01.020]  More chins than Chinatown and this clown telling us who we should be and what we should do.
[02:34:01.644 --> 02:34:02.985]  You got your own trip, man.
[02:34:03.105 --> 02:34:05.567]  Stay on it, but don't tell me I gotta swallow it.
[02:34:05.827 --> 02:34:06.848]  I don't care less.
[02:34:07.408 --> 02:34:09.930]  Who you are, what you do, save your garbage.
[02:34:11.011 --> 02:34:14.973]  Again, Napoleon marches to Moscow with 420,000 men.
[02:34:14.993 --> 02:34:14.973]  1812.
[02:34:15.033 --> 02:34:15.454]  Came back with 10,000.
[02:34:15.313 --> 02:34:27.313]   20,000 men 1812 came back with 10,000. Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, killed 27 million,
[02:34:27.313 --> 02:34:29.553]  27 million Russians.
[02:34:29.656 --> 02:34:33.178]  Who were the first ones to attack and beat Germany?
[02:34:33.659 --> 02:34:34.199]  The Russians.
[02:34:34.780 --> 02:34:41.385]  I am totally 100% opposed to Putin's invasion.
[02:34:42.246 --> 02:34:43.787]  I believe it could have been done another way.
[02:34:45.008 --> 02:34:49.271]  And I know the way it could have been done, just like that.
[02:34:49.771 --> 02:34:51.593]  And we come back, I'm going to tell you.
[02:34:52.113 --> 02:34:57.026]   But in the meantime, Do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:34:58.266 --> 02:35:08.088]  The staff, Alex Jones, the fighter that that man is, and all the pressure that he's under, and he keeps going and going and going.
[02:35:08.848 --> 02:35:10.728]  And you gotta keep it going, too.
[02:35:11.329 --> 02:35:14.789]  Put your heart and money where your mind is.
[02:35:15.209 --> 02:35:16.010]  We're gonna be right back.
[02:35:17.630 --> 02:35:22.891]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show, and again, do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[02:35:23.803 --> 02:35:25.224]  Our lives are on the line.
[02:35:25.304 --> 02:35:26.805]  World War III has begun.
[02:35:26.825 --> 02:35:38.952]  You know, when we're little kids, you know, and you're into the public school system, the moronic system of brainwashing, they tell you World War I began when they assassinated Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo.
[02:35:39.292 --> 02:35:39.873]  Yeah, okay.
[02:35:40.573 --> 02:35:41.414]  Take it easy, man.
[02:35:41.754 --> 02:35:42.795]  What's a Sarajevo?
[02:35:42.835 --> 02:35:44.616]  Who cares about an Archduke?
[02:35:44.916 --> 02:35:46.036]  It was building up to this.
[02:35:47.617 --> 02:35:48.858]  And they are now building up.
[02:35:48.898 --> 02:35:51.740]  You're seeing the words coming out of Biden's mouth.
[02:35:52.535 --> 02:35:53.616]  Taking us to war.
[02:35:55.176 --> 02:35:59.518]  And I was listening to Alex before I came on the air and he was talking about that guy Larry Fink.
[02:36:00.619 --> 02:36:01.699]  The head of Blackstone.
[02:36:01.759 --> 02:36:03.720]  Where they controlling 10 trillion dollars?
[02:36:04.720 --> 02:36:06.021]  Think of the cat's name, man.
[02:36:07.762 --> 02:36:09.262]  Larry Fink.
[02:36:10.203 --> 02:36:12.484]  Who would wanna be a Fink?
[02:36:13.604 --> 02:36:14.545]  A Fink!
[02:36:15.805 --> 02:36:17.126]  You know what the Fink said?
[02:36:18.556 --> 02:36:23.099]  The thing said that, oh, you know, with this Russia thing going on, it's going to hurt globalism.
[02:36:23.159 --> 02:36:23.960]  That's his words.
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:25.141]  Oh, globalism.
[02:36:25.181 --> 02:36:25.741]  Isn't it great?
[02:36:26.602 --> 02:36:33.466]  And as Alex Jones is saying, they're creating a whole new world, a whole new world disorder.
[02:36:34.287 --> 02:36:36.749]  And we have Joe Duran, who writes for the Trends Journal.
[02:36:36.929 --> 02:36:39.831]  His new book just came out that you got to check out.
[02:36:39.871 --> 02:36:42.032]  It's called Leaving Humanity.
[02:36:43.153 --> 02:36:45.795]  And it's the corrupt design of the technocrats.
[02:36:46.624 --> 02:36:51.006]  The technocratic elites, like the Finks.
[02:36:51.346 --> 02:36:59.190]  Could you imagine, could you imagine having a name like Fink and talking about what investors like, like Alex Jones showed?
[02:36:59.450 --> 02:37:14.277]  Oh yeah, we like dictators, so we know how much money we can make and keep all of it for ourselves and put all the small businesses out of business as merger and acquisition activity increased last year to the highest levels ever.
[02:37:15.538 --> 02:37:17.059]  And the bigs keep getting bigger.
[02:37:17.079 --> 02:37:20.162]  So you gotta check out Joe Duran's book.
[02:37:20.822 --> 02:37:23.264]  You get it on Amazon, you get it at Barnes and Noble.
[02:37:23.784 --> 02:37:28.028]  It's a terrific piece of work, and it's very important for these times ahead.
[02:37:28.648 --> 02:37:30.289]  Leaving humanity!
[02:37:31.290 --> 02:37:32.251]  We've left it!
[02:37:32.591 --> 02:37:35.233]  Look at the little freaks in charge!
[02:37:35.694 --> 02:37:36.975]  How stupid!
[02:37:37.435 --> 02:37:43.259]  How low-life can you be to look up to a little Zuckerberg?
[02:37:44.020 --> 02:37:45.261]  Look at that little clown!
[02:37:45.993 --> 02:37:46.893]  No, no, no!
[02:37:47.453 --> 02:37:48.333]  I like cook.
[02:37:48.734 --> 02:37:51.314]  Yeah, cook me some cook from another guy.
[02:37:51.774 --> 02:37:53.995]  Oh no, that guy Peach Eye for Google.
[02:37:54.255 --> 02:37:56.035]  Now there's a man for me!
[02:37:57.115 --> 02:37:59.656]  The King James Bible got it wrong.
[02:38:01.216 --> 02:38:01.816]  Look at this guy.
[02:38:01.976 --> 02:38:02.576]  Look at this guy.
[02:38:02.996 --> 02:38:04.037]  Look at him!
[02:38:04.717 --> 02:38:09.578]  Look at the misfits that are running and ruining our lives!
[02:38:10.478 --> 02:38:11.178]  Look at them!
[02:38:12.495 --> 02:38:14.336]  They've left humanity.
[02:38:14.676 --> 02:38:16.596]  We're leaving humanity.
[02:38:17.137 --> 02:38:21.318]  It's the corrupt design of the technocratic elites.
[02:38:22.198 --> 02:38:22.819]  Look at them.
[02:38:24.119 --> 02:38:24.639]  Look at them.
[02:38:25.639 --> 02:38:27.100]  How about Soros, huh?
[02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:30.861]  You want to see a freak from another planet?
[02:38:31.421 --> 02:38:33.502]  Oh, I forgot that guy, Klaus Schwab, man.
[02:38:33.762 --> 02:38:36.883]  Now, there's a cat that I'd love to have a good time with.
[02:38:38.124 --> 02:38:39.164]  Look at these people.
[02:38:40.985 --> 02:38:41.905]  It's a takeover.
[02:38:43.983 --> 02:38:49.009]  Think complaining about we may be seeing an end to globalization.
[02:38:49.730 --> 02:38:57.480]  Before globalization, when that other low-life piece of murderous scum crap, Bill Clinton?
[02:38:59.322 --> 02:38:59.803]  NAFTA.
[02:39:00.347 --> 02:39:02.768]  Yeah, send the jobs to Mexico.
[02:39:02.788 --> 02:39:05.329]  You don't have to pay them people a lot to work.
[02:39:05.850 --> 02:39:11.372]  Yeah, they can make the stuff for you cheaper, and you don't need the dirty manufacturing here.
[02:39:11.893 --> 02:39:15.694]  Oh, Bill, when he got caught with his pants down, Clinton?
[02:39:17.455 --> 02:39:22.157]  Every time he did bombs away over Baghdad and Iraq?
[02:39:22.658 --> 02:39:26.900]  Oh, and everybody's so sorry that Madeleine Albright died?
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:29.561]  How about Madeleine not all that bright?
[02:39:30.612 --> 02:39:45.521]  When she's on 60 Minutes and Leslie Stahl asks her, is the death of over 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five worth the price?
[02:39:46.362 --> 02:39:48.883]  And she says, yes, it is.
[02:39:49.884 --> 02:39:51.185]  All right.
[02:39:51.825 --> 02:39:55.367]  That's who's running and ruining our lives.
[02:39:56.008 --> 02:39:57.749]  Oh, but those Russians.
[02:39:59.502 --> 02:40:00.563]  Oh, those Russians.
[02:40:00.623 --> 02:40:00.864]  Yep.
[02:40:01.924 --> 02:40:03.125]  Oh, depleted uranium.
[02:40:03.806 --> 02:40:06.008]  1999 attack on Yugoslavia.
[02:40:06.448 --> 02:40:18.157]  Look up, look up Joe Biden's comments about how he wanted bombs away across Yugoslavia.
[02:40:18.177 --> 02:40:19.819]  Oh, yeah.
[02:40:19.879 --> 02:40:20.940]  What's a Yugoslavia?
[02:40:20.980 --> 02:40:22.221]  They don't exist anymore.
[02:40:22.241 --> 02:40:23.302]  Yeah.
[02:40:24.688 --> 02:40:30.733]  Joe Biden, again, this guy did everything he could to avoid the Vietnam War.
[02:40:31.794 --> 02:40:33.556]  He got a bunch of deferments.
[02:40:34.557 --> 02:40:36.839]  And he got a one-way, like he had asthma or something.
[02:40:36.859 --> 02:40:37.739]  Like, I can't go fight.
[02:40:38.060 --> 02:40:39.261]  I love these people.
[02:40:39.501 --> 02:40:41.903]  Oh, like, little Lindsey, you come out of the closet.
[02:40:41.943 --> 02:40:43.244]  Yeah, Graham, we gotta fight.
[02:40:44.125 --> 02:40:46.887]  Anybody that wants to go fight, go lead the fight.
[02:40:48.008 --> 02:40:50.130]  Because America doesn't have its fight in it.
[02:40:51.172 --> 02:40:54.174]  Look at the clown show last night that they call the Oscars.
[02:40:54.514 --> 02:40:57.976]  It shows you how low America has sunk.
[02:40:59.037 --> 02:41:15.967]  It shows you how low America has sunk when they put on a crap show like this and they got that clip of that guy, Smith, walking up to Chris Rock and boom, slapping.
[02:41:19.529 --> 02:41:19.689]  Yep.
[02:41:21.112 --> 02:41:23.574]  Walking up to him and slapping him.
[02:41:26.977 --> 02:41:27.197]  Yep.
[02:41:27.778 --> 02:41:28.559]  Telling a joke.
[02:41:29.620 --> 02:41:30.500]  Can't tell a joke.
[02:41:31.161 --> 02:41:32.522]  No, no, no jokes allowed.
[02:41:32.983 --> 02:41:33.423]  Hey, look at this.
[02:41:33.483 --> 02:41:34.224]  Walking up to him.
[02:41:35.385 --> 02:41:35.685]  Boom.
[02:41:36.366 --> 02:41:38.908]  And look at him just stand there and then he turns his back around.
[02:41:39.809 --> 02:41:42.271]  These men aren't fighters.
[02:41:43.692 --> 02:41:44.593]  I'm a fighter.
[02:41:47.065 --> 02:41:47.385]  Look at that.
[02:41:47.786 --> 02:41:48.686]  Just standing there.
[02:41:49.027 --> 02:41:56.032]  Now, if a friend of mine walked up to me and slapped me across the face, boom.
[02:41:56.973 --> 02:41:58.474]  I would not have expected it.
[02:42:00.355 --> 02:42:03.538]  And I would have gotten a slap, because I would never expect a friend to do that.
[02:42:03.938 --> 02:42:09.242]  But once I got that slap in, I'd be on that guy and he'd be down on the ground and he'd be out.
[02:42:10.191 --> 02:42:11.271]  But no, no!
[02:42:11.511 --> 02:42:13.212]  Hey, Chris, you can't rock, man!
[02:42:13.812 --> 02:42:14.632]  Wait, what happened?
[02:42:14.652 --> 02:42:17.213]  What'd you lose, your little cojones, huh?
[02:42:17.753 --> 02:42:19.794]  Oh, you just took it and laughed and smiled?
[02:42:20.074 --> 02:42:20.874]  You're not a man!
[02:42:21.234 --> 02:42:22.654]  You are an American!
[02:42:22.935 --> 02:42:24.255]  That's where America's gone!
[02:42:24.575 --> 02:42:26.456]  You guys are the emblem of it!
[02:42:26.816 --> 02:42:31.337]  Oh, and that tough guy, Smith, he turns around and walks away!
[02:42:31.357 --> 02:42:31.437]  Yeah!
[02:42:33.037 --> 02:42:38.679]  Hey, when you're in the fight, man, you don't turn your back on it and walk away, because you're down on the ground!
[02:42:40.137 --> 02:42:40.377]  Yeah.
[02:42:41.077 --> 02:42:42.798]  You slap me, a friend, boom!
[02:42:42.918 --> 02:42:45.498]  They would've got me and they'd be gone, man.
[02:42:45.978 --> 02:42:47.038]  I'd be on that cat.
[02:42:48.299 --> 02:42:54.380]  Go to, yep, the guy, John Perkins, not that John Perkins, the real John Perkins.
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:43:02.642]  We have survivalism trends in the Trends Journal each week by Bradley Steiner, who was the teacher of my teacher.
[02:43:03.162 --> 02:43:03.642]  That's right.
[02:43:04.602 --> 02:43:05.682]  Guided chaos.
[02:43:07.203 --> 02:43:07.923]  That's the link.
[02:43:09.113 --> 02:43:10.694]  Guidedchaos.com.
[02:43:12.015 --> 02:43:15.518]  Learn how to be a fighter, because America doesn't have a fight.
[02:43:15.859 --> 02:43:17.981]  Oh, a transgender Tory army.
[02:43:18.361 --> 02:43:18.841]  Oh, yeah.
[02:43:18.941 --> 02:43:19.822]  Great, man.
[02:43:19.922 --> 02:43:20.463]  Great.
[02:43:21.003 --> 02:43:21.423]  Great.
[02:43:21.744 --> 02:43:24.926]  Oh, listen, I used to work out with great women that were great fighters.
[02:43:25.787 --> 02:43:28.269]  When I'm in a fight, man, I want more guys on my side.
[02:43:29.010 --> 02:43:39.565]   Oh, if you don't believe me, it was a guy by the name of Muammar Gaddafi, who the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, Barack Obama, Gaddafi has to go?
[02:43:39.905 --> 02:43:40.526]  Yeah, that one.
[02:43:42.206 --> 02:43:43.746]  He had all women bodyguards.
[02:43:45.227 --> 02:43:45.707]  Yeah, great.
[02:43:46.247 --> 02:43:48.748]  And I would have some there because you would never expect them.
[02:43:49.328 --> 02:43:51.068]  But I want the guys there for the fight.
[02:43:51.809 --> 02:43:52.709]  Guided chaos.
[02:43:53.469 --> 02:43:55.249]  We are in the fight for our lives.
[02:43:55.810 --> 02:43:56.270]  There he is.
[02:43:56.290 --> 02:43:59.410]  The Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner.
[02:43:59.711 --> 02:44:01.051]  Assad has to go!
[02:44:02.185 --> 02:44:04.646]  Oh, oh, oh, talking about Russia losing?
[02:44:05.206 --> 02:44:06.827]  Do you remember?
[02:44:07.407 --> 02:44:11.288]  Do you remember Obama's troop surge in Afghanistan?
[02:44:11.828 --> 02:44:13.529]  It worked perfectly!
[02:44:13.549 --> 02:44:16.850]  I was only nine years into it.
[02:44:18.771 --> 02:44:19.011]  Yep.
[02:44:20.532 --> 02:44:22.112]  We are in a dangerous time.
[02:44:23.493 --> 02:44:24.993]  Do everything you can.
[02:44:25.153 --> 02:44:30.213]   And by the way, those little guys, We should get some super male vitality.
[02:44:30.654 --> 02:44:34.156]  Yeah, rockin' Smith, because you ain't got it.
[02:44:35.176 --> 02:44:36.017]  This might help you.
[02:44:37.538 --> 02:44:42.901]  Hey, you know, Alex just said, you know, that about that 1776 coin.
[02:44:43.681 --> 02:44:44.301]  Think about it.
[02:44:44.321 --> 02:44:44.301]  1776.
[02:44:45.422 --> 02:44:50.065]  The Declaration of Independence.
[02:44:51.606 --> 02:44:57.149]  And once upon a time, there was a man named Samuel Adams who said it does not take a majority to prevail.
[02:44:58.089 --> 02:45:04.032]  But rather an irate, tireless minority keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men.
[02:45:05.512 --> 02:45:13.115]  And the people that tuned into InfoWars are that irate, tireless minority.
[02:45:15.936 --> 02:45:18.858]  So do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:45:18.898 --> 02:45:20.879]  They got a whole great line of products too.
[02:45:21.659 --> 02:45:22.799]  Again, that's a great coin, 1776.
[02:45:25.380 --> 02:45:34.448]  But also, you know, they're bringing a lot of products to you that are going to help you, like a BioTruth Selenium, which is just back in stock, and it's 40% off.
[02:45:35.969 --> 02:45:38.511]  And it's one savings after another.
[02:45:40.573 --> 02:45:48.480]  But this coin, you know, this one-of-a-kind coin, and it says what the spirit of this country was.
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:57.154]   Remember, when the revolution started, you know, depending on whose numbers you're looking at, Less than 5% of the people supported it.
[02:45:58.634 --> 02:46:02.675]  The Declaration of Independence, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:46:03.235 --> 02:46:08.577]  The COVID war, they stole our happiness, the pursuit of it, and happiness is a dirty word.
[02:46:09.717 --> 02:46:13.958]  So these Patriot collectibles are something that are really important to have.
[02:46:14.398 --> 02:46:21.080]  And they're worth, it's not like you're getting, you're giving away money, you're getting back a lot more than you're giving when you look over time.
[02:46:22.420 --> 02:46:24.204]   And again, My favorite?
[02:46:25.085 --> 02:46:26.666]  Super male vitality.
[02:46:26.686 --> 02:46:28.507]  And maybe a little Willie.
[02:46:28.807 --> 02:46:29.367]  Little Willie.
[02:46:29.607 --> 02:46:30.408]  Oh, maybe that's it.
[02:46:30.808 --> 02:46:33.530]  Maybe that's why they call him Willie Smith.
[02:46:33.930 --> 02:46:35.471]  Oh, it's a little Willie Smith.
[02:46:35.911 --> 02:46:38.172]  Arrogant guy slapping a guy like that.
[02:46:38.573 --> 02:46:39.573]  Turning his back.
[02:46:40.274 --> 02:46:40.794]  Oh, yeah.
[02:46:40.834 --> 02:46:41.614]  Little Willie.
[02:46:42.395 --> 02:46:44.716]  And Chris doesn't know how to rock.
[02:46:45.297 --> 02:46:47.058]  No, because he just takes it.
[02:46:47.478 --> 02:46:47.838]  Look at him.
[02:46:49.139 --> 02:46:49.459]  Look at him.
[02:46:50.089 --> 02:46:50.929]  Man, that was me, man.
[02:46:50.949 --> 02:46:53.650]  That guy, beyond his back, on his face.
[02:46:53.970 --> 02:46:58.210]  I bashed a guy's head open for doing that to me.
[02:47:00.191 --> 02:47:00.451]  Look at him.
[02:47:00.851 --> 02:47:01.151]  Look at him.
[02:47:02.211 --> 02:47:03.351]  Hands behind his back.
[02:47:03.671 --> 02:47:05.492]  What kind of coward would hit a guy like that?
[02:47:05.692 --> 02:47:06.732]  And look at him walk away.
[02:47:07.612 --> 02:47:07.912]  Again.
[02:47:09.432 --> 02:47:11.533]  Guidedchaos.com.
[02:47:12.233 --> 02:47:13.533]  Learn how to be a fighter.
[02:47:13.593 --> 02:47:18.194]  I wouldn't be me if I wasn't a black belt, close combat guy.
[02:47:18.734 --> 02:47:19.294]  That's right.
[02:47:20.714 --> 02:47:22.635]  Yeah, real violence is chaos.
[02:47:23.355 --> 02:47:26.456]  Adapt, improvise, and survive.
[02:47:26.936 --> 02:47:28.717]  Improvise, you just saw it.
[02:47:29.157 --> 02:47:31.097]  You never know what it's gonna look like.
[02:47:31.798 --> 02:47:35.039]  And nobody, nobody out there could touch John Perkins.
[02:47:35.859 --> 02:47:36.579]  A man of men.
[02:47:37.479 --> 02:47:43.341]  And beyond my parents, may they so rest in peace, no one changed my life more than he did.
[02:47:43.361 --> 02:47:48.303]  Because I used to be the toughest kid when I would move from the Bronx to Yonkers.
[02:47:49.190 --> 02:47:51.391]  I was this little kid, man, they wanted to pick on me.
[02:47:52.431 --> 02:47:54.572]  And I was the fighter, man, nobody'd mess with me.
[02:47:55.432 --> 02:48:03.575]  And then, in the fifth grade, Sister Marie Rose, may she rot in hell, grabbed me by my little blue tie, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!
[02:48:03.955 --> 02:48:06.155]  And blew out my eardrum on my middle ear.
[02:48:07.876 --> 02:48:11.177]  Lost my balance, I was a great athlete, fastest kid around.
[02:48:12.177 --> 02:48:14.578]  Left me back, I became the stupidest kid in the school.
[02:48:16.508 --> 02:48:20.109]  As bad as it was, I'm just thankful Father Foley was a ladies' man.
[02:48:20.169 --> 02:48:21.390]  It could have been a lot worse.
[02:48:23.611 --> 02:48:25.491]  This ruined me for a lot of years.
[02:48:27.152 --> 02:48:27.872]  A lot of years.
[02:48:28.292 --> 02:48:29.133]  I lost my fight.
[02:48:30.393 --> 02:48:31.474]  I lost my confidence.
[02:48:32.974 --> 02:48:33.855]  But I got it back.
[02:48:34.935 --> 02:48:36.476]  And that's why I am who I am.
[02:48:37.616 --> 02:48:38.936]  I tell the stories out here.
[02:48:39.877 --> 02:48:40.677]  End of October.
[02:48:42.058 --> 02:48:44.178]  Sitting outside my place over here.
[02:48:44.639 --> 02:48:45.499]  With a lovely woman.
[02:48:46.269 --> 02:48:53.192]  Having some espresso and some guy comes over, thing in his nose, chains all over him.
[02:48:54.673 --> 02:49:01.956]  He starts calling me a racist and a white privileged guy and cursing me out for being on Alex Jones.
[02:49:02.016 --> 02:49:04.457]  And I'm asking the guy to leave nice and it doesn't work.
[02:49:04.997 --> 02:49:06.958]  Keep asking him, keep asking him.
[02:49:08.219 --> 02:49:19.585]   And he stood up, never expected an old 75 year old guy To come at a man and call him out and I'll take you out.
[02:49:20.826 --> 02:49:21.187]  Yeah!
[02:49:22.928 --> 02:49:23.729]  John Perkins.
[02:49:23.749 --> 02:49:25.510]  And this is the life that we're in right now.
[02:49:27.172 --> 02:49:28.132]  Everybody listening.
[02:49:29.253 --> 02:49:31.095]  You better get in the best shape you can.
[02:49:32.756 --> 02:49:34.298]  Real violence is chaos.
[02:49:34.858 --> 02:49:35.659]  You just saw it.
[02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:41.203]  And it shows you how low we've gone when that's what the Oscars have become.
[02:49:42.044 --> 02:49:44.046]  You need to get in the best shape you can.
[02:49:45.009 --> 02:49:47.931]  Physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[02:49:48.851 --> 02:49:50.552]  I have never worked harder in my life.
[02:49:52.393 --> 02:49:52.633]  Never!
[02:49:53.633 --> 02:49:57.936]  We're putting out a magazine, there's nothing in the world that could come close to what the Trends Journal.
[02:49:58.296 --> 02:50:03.358]  We give every ounce of energy we have, because we know what perilous times we're in.
[02:50:04.339 --> 02:50:05.840]  And so does InfoWards.
[02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:10.162]  I, you know, I see what Alex Jones goes through, you know.
[02:50:10.882 --> 02:50:14.604]  Oh my God, I don't know if I could, I mean, I mean, this guy's a man!
[02:50:17.293 --> 02:50:21.816]  Fighting the way he does, and how the system is trying to bring him down.
[02:50:24.358 --> 02:50:28.741]  And the staff, loyal, they're fighting for freedom.
[02:50:30.422 --> 02:50:34.645]  So anyway, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:50:35.166 --> 02:50:36.347]  And those coins, man.
[02:50:36.987 --> 02:50:38.248]  Well, I gotta say, and Wim, man.
[02:50:38.568 --> 02:50:40.109]  Oh, and all you in-betweens.
[02:50:40.830 --> 02:50:41.030]  Yeah.
[02:50:41.430 --> 02:50:45.053]  Own this one-of-a-kind founding member's silver coin.
[02:50:46.878 --> 02:50:52.101]  1776, the spirit of America, my America.
[02:50:53.542 --> 02:50:57.964]  So, on the market front, the Dow is down a lot today.
[02:50:58.024 --> 02:50:58.865]  It's up a little bit.
[02:50:58.985 --> 02:50:59.865]  Gold's getting hit.
[02:51:00.546 --> 02:51:01.666]  Bitcoin's going up.
[02:51:02.667 --> 02:51:03.427]  Here's the deal.
[02:51:05.208 --> 02:51:08.150]  We're going to go, they're talking about stagflation.
[02:51:08.450 --> 02:51:10.351]  It's not going to be stagflation.
[02:51:11.071 --> 02:51:12.352]  It's going to be dragflation.
[02:51:13.300 --> 02:51:15.922]  We are going to see inflation numbers hit new records.
[02:51:18.043 --> 02:51:22.665]  So inflation is going to go up as the economy drags down, not stagnant.
[02:51:22.725 --> 02:51:23.846]  That's stagflation.
[02:51:24.166 --> 02:51:25.347]  It's dragflation.
[02:51:27.428 --> 02:51:29.289]  And Lola might like dragflation.
[02:51:29.369 --> 02:51:34.772]  You know, Lola, L-O-L-A, Lola, who's our health minister there, Rachel.
[02:51:35.473 --> 02:51:36.273]  Rachel Levin.
[02:51:36.633 --> 02:51:37.713]  Holy Christ.
[02:51:37.993 --> 02:51:40.074]  You know, save your trip for yourself, man.
[02:51:40.334 --> 02:51:41.414]  Or women, not sure.
[02:51:41.434 --> 02:51:46.115]  Oh, and talking about not sure, how about the clown that plays the defense chair?
[02:51:47.155 --> 02:51:47.955]  Jerome Powell.
[02:51:49.055 --> 02:51:52.276]  BS-ing over a year ago that inflation is only temporary.
[02:51:53.196 --> 02:51:55.116]  Oh, no, it's only transitory.
[02:51:55.676 --> 02:51:59.377]  And then, of course, maybe to become proper, we could call it transgender-tory.
[02:52:01.637 --> 02:52:03.758]  You know, people, you know, I do the YouTube.
[02:52:03.998 --> 02:52:04.558]  Look at this guy.
[02:52:05.984 --> 02:52:07.044]  This inflation's real.
[02:52:07.064 --> 02:52:15.666]  And, you know, I do, um, you know, the YouTubes, and I can't say things that I say on Alex's show, you know, because that'd be censored.
[02:52:16.907 --> 02:52:19.347]  And people say, you know, Salenti, you have to watch your language.
[02:52:19.407 --> 02:52:20.827]  I'm not in the third grade.
[02:52:21.388 --> 02:52:22.148]  Take it easy.
[02:52:23.688 --> 02:52:29.710]  If somebody's gonna screw with me and try to take me out, man, it's gonna get ugly.
[02:52:31.310 --> 02:52:33.550]  Oh, not like Chris Rock, man.
[02:52:34.271 --> 02:52:34.431]  Yeah.
[02:52:34.691 --> 02:52:39.178]   Hey, Chris, don't forget, You need some super male vitality.
[02:52:39.998 --> 02:52:45.580]  Anyway, swearing like a trooper eases pain, just like pills, study shows.
[02:52:46.920 --> 02:52:54.142]  The get popping, the paracetamol, swearing like a trooper will ease your pain, a study shows.
[02:52:57.203 --> 02:53:06.666]  F-ing and blinding, especially shouting, S in a thing and an F with it, those other things, is so effective, researchers say it should be encouraged during medical treatments.
[02:53:07.745 --> 02:53:10.106]  Researchers say swearing should be encouraged.
[02:53:10.926 --> 02:53:17.408]  Letting rip it is thought to help by distracting us and making us less uptight.
[02:53:17.648 --> 02:53:18.188]  You got it.
[02:53:18.868 --> 02:53:21.409]  When you let it out, you get it out.
[02:53:22.169 --> 02:53:23.470]  And I'm Monopoly Tano.
[02:53:24.170 --> 02:53:25.310]  So get that in your head.
[02:53:26.170 --> 02:53:28.251]  I'm not one of these tight cats, man.
[02:53:28.831 --> 02:53:31.752]  I'm Monopoly Tano, born in the Bronx, born to be free.
[02:53:32.352 --> 02:53:33.113]  You let it out.
[02:53:34.233 --> 02:53:36.460]   And then It's a whole different ship.
[02:53:36.961 --> 02:53:41.883]  You go from, oh, my heart's broken for what happened to I'll sling your throat if you screw with me.
[02:53:45.605 --> 02:53:59.032]  Dr. Richard Steffens, Senior Lecturer in Psychology at Keele University, said, swearing is drug-free, calorie-free, cost-free, and side-effective-free.
[02:53:59.867 --> 02:54:00.948]  So why not try it?
[02:54:01.408 --> 02:54:02.149]  Why not try it?
[02:54:02.509 --> 02:54:07.053]  Because they brainwash you to take the fight out of you as a little kid.
[02:54:07.533 --> 02:54:10.055]  Oh, that's, you're not using proper language.
[02:54:10.335 --> 02:54:13.718]  You have to say things like, Assad must go.
[02:54:13.738 --> 02:54:16.720]  Gaddafi must go.
[02:54:16.740 --> 02:54:21.003]  Hussein must go.
[02:54:21.023 --> 02:54:23.585]  You can't say, I'm going to kill this guy.
[02:54:23.946 --> 02:54:26.467]  No, because then, then they get him to the scene.
[02:54:26.487 --> 02:54:29.630]  So you got to lie your way into it and be a coward.
[02:54:31.795 --> 02:54:33.517]  We're in the fight for our lives.
[02:54:34.417 --> 02:54:37.440]  If we don't unite for peace, we're going to die for war.
[02:54:39.642 --> 02:54:46.948]  Again, do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[02:54:47.829 --> 02:54:48.950]  They got great products.
[02:54:48.990 --> 02:54:50.090]  They're BioSelenium.
[02:54:50.611 --> 02:54:53.053]  And remember, we're leaving humanity.
[02:54:53.292 --> 02:55:03.612]  So check out Joe Durand's book.
[02:55:03.718 --> 02:55:10.222]  I got sued more than 50 times by the Democrats after Trump won, and we knocked out and defeated 46 of them.
[02:55:10.322 --> 02:55:16.806]  And we're down to four of the major lawsuits where Democrats sued us in completely rigged jurisdictions and with rigged courts.
[02:55:16.866 --> 02:55:18.226]  Just unbelievable over the top.
[02:55:18.347 --> 02:55:20.688]  In Connecticut, in New Haven, and in Austin, Texas.
[02:55:20.888 --> 02:55:30.014]  Now, I can sit there and keep battling them with the three Austin trials and one Connecticut trial through October.
[02:55:31.169 --> 02:55:31.730]  of this year.
[02:55:32.230 --> 02:55:33.371]  That's four trials.
[02:55:33.571 --> 02:55:40.297]  They're doing four different lawsuits with the Sandy Hook people, two different law firms, all coordinated, to bankrupt us.
[02:55:41.378 --> 02:55:47.663]  And they know now, because the court's ordering all this stuff that's unconstitutional, our finances, they know there's not extra money there.
[02:55:47.923 --> 02:55:49.364]  And they've told us, we don't care.
[02:55:49.684 --> 02:55:52.147]  We want you to be shut down.
[02:55:52.647 --> 02:55:54.248]  Or you can come out against the Second Amendment.
[02:55:54.268 --> 02:55:55.029]  They've actually told us that.
[02:55:55.770 --> 02:55:56.670]  And I'm not going to do that.
[02:55:57.431 --> 02:55:58.132]  It's very simple.
[02:55:59.221 --> 02:56:05.444]  So I can go through the kangaroo trials with them and do all that and then appeal it and hold them off another year or two.
[02:56:05.464 --> 02:56:09.245]  Because their goal is to just come padlock and shut this place down.
[02:56:10.045 --> 02:56:14.247]  Or we can just boycott their trials and then they get their $500 million judgments.
[02:56:14.447 --> 02:56:15.227]  That's what they asked for.
[02:56:15.428 --> 02:56:20.310]  They asked the insurance company that Genesis has.
[02:56:20.670 --> 02:56:22.230]  I don't have liability insurance for speech.
[02:56:22.710 --> 02:56:24.271]  They said we want $590 million.
[02:56:24.331 --> 02:56:25.232]  Excuse me, it's $590 million.
[02:56:25.252 --> 02:56:26.152]  Ted doesn't have $2 million.
[02:56:29.053 --> 02:56:40.120]  Okay, that's how out of control these people are because when you're in a rigged game and know it's all rigged and known that, you know, it's all set up from the beginning with judicial tyranny, you can do stuff like that.
[02:56:40.300 --> 02:56:41.440]  They're not going to shut me up.
[02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:42.661]  I'm not going to be shut down.
[02:56:43.001 --> 02:56:48.665]  They can try to, you know, hurt this operation in this facility, but oh, let me tell you, they're not, they're not going to silence anything.
[02:56:49.365 --> 02:56:57.463]   The point is, is that this crew and this infrastructure and all the reporters And all the things that we do here that's so important needs to continue on.
[02:56:57.483 --> 02:56:58.984]  So I've decided to go ahead and battle it.
[02:56:59.304 --> 02:57:00.705]  And I've decided to go ahead and fight them.
[02:57:00.725 --> 02:57:03.646]  And I've decided to let them have their show trials and all the rest of it.
[02:57:03.666 --> 02:57:12.471]  And, you know, a judge that says we can't put on evidence because we're already guilty in a default, but we're going to have a jury trial about how guilty I am.
[02:57:12.971 --> 02:57:14.972]  So you're guilty if they just decide how guilty.
[02:57:15.732 --> 02:57:16.492]  Unbelievable!
[02:57:16.752 --> 02:57:17.393]  That's all fine.
[02:57:17.433 --> 02:57:18.153]  We'll let them do it.
[02:57:18.533 --> 02:57:20.633]  Every weapon formed against us will not prosper.
[02:57:20.914 --> 02:57:23.254]  Whatever the devil means for evil, God turns to good.
[02:57:23.594 --> 02:57:29.076]  I've seen this so many times, but we need the funds to go through these four trials.
[02:57:29.556 --> 02:57:32.577]  They want six to eight weeks in Connecticut for their extravaganza.
[02:57:33.097 --> 02:57:42.347]   In Austin, they have BBC and HBO and the lawyers primping and the judge primping and coming in all excited.
[02:57:42.468 --> 02:57:43.388]  It's disgusting.
[02:57:43.609 --> 02:57:45.050]  They claim I live off Sandy Hook.
[02:57:45.250 --> 02:57:46.871]  They claim I made money off Sandy Hook.
[02:57:47.212 --> 02:57:49.013]  You know, this Elizabeth Williams writes a book about it.
[02:57:49.033 --> 02:57:49.754]  It's all over the news.
[02:57:50.074 --> 02:57:52.256]  Selling her book saying I made money off Sandy Hook.
[02:57:52.516 --> 02:57:53.457]  Never made money off that.
[02:57:53.497 --> 02:57:54.438]  Barely ever talked about it.
[02:57:54.738 --> 02:57:57.901]  These are a disgusting lot of leeches.
[02:57:58.362 --> 02:57:59.923]  Okay, these media people, these lawyers.
[02:58:00.123 --> 02:58:00.783]  But that's fine.
[02:58:01.024 --> 02:58:02.444]  Everybody sees them for what they are.
[02:58:02.805 --> 02:58:03.965]  Everybody gets what's happening.
[02:58:04.246 --> 02:58:06.767]  It's all turning to crap in their hands.
[02:58:07.307 --> 02:58:09.108]  But I need funds to fight this war.
[02:58:09.629 --> 02:58:10.509]  This information war.
[02:58:10.589 --> 02:58:12.651]  So, it's very simple.
[02:58:12.971 --> 02:58:14.752]  All of our work's coming to a head right now.
[02:58:14.852 --> 02:58:18.714]  Every day we're having major breakthroughs and just doing incredible things.
[02:58:18.754 --> 02:58:19.395]  Thanks for your support.
[02:58:20.182 --> 02:58:21.762]  But I need more capital now than ever.
[02:58:21.802 --> 02:58:24.303]  We had to build our own infrastructure, our own bandwidth, our own everything.
[02:58:24.783 --> 02:58:26.243]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:26.423 --> 02:58:33.224]  Go there and that will, by buying the products, pay for the 5, 6, 7, 8 million views a day we get at Man.Video.
[02:58:33.324 --> 02:58:38.185]  And that'll pay for the broadcast here and the infrastructure and all of this that's hurting the New World Order.
[02:58:38.345 --> 02:58:39.545]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:39.565 --> 02:58:41.386]  We have up to 75% off right now.
[02:58:41.786 --> 02:58:44.806]  Massive clearance sale to fund this legal defense of this battle.
[02:58:44.966 --> 02:58:46.047]  And we're never going to give up.
[02:58:46.267 --> 02:58:47.167]  We're never going to get it in.
[02:58:47.227 --> 02:58:48.167]  But we could give out.
[02:58:48.588 --> 02:58:52.177]  So we need your financial support now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:58:52.277 --> 02:59:12.277]  Don't wait and I salute you and thank you all.
[02:59:12.280 --> 02:59:13.581]  I've been taking it for 20 years.
[02:59:13.701 --> 02:59:17.624]  I learned with children especially when they were, you know, tired and grumpy but not going to sleep.
[02:59:17.744 --> 02:59:24.749]  Give them a little bit of that, you know, mood stuff or whatever you want to call it and they would sleep a lot better and it's good for their heart, their whole electrochemical system.
[02:59:24.909 --> 02:59:29.731]  So, our developers came up with one that has both types of the good magnesium and tastes even better.
[02:59:29.851 --> 02:59:30.871]  And I'm just blown away by it.
[02:59:30.891 --> 02:59:32.051]  It's been sold out for eight months.
[02:59:32.131 --> 02:59:33.352]  I'm so glad it's back in.
[02:59:33.452 --> 02:59:35.412]  Fizzy Magnesium, 25% off.
[02:59:35.913 --> 02:59:36.833]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:59:36.853 --> 02:59:37.973]  You need to experience it.
[02:59:38.453 --> 02:59:39.394]  And then a new item.
[02:59:40.134 --> 02:59:41.916]  I've been wanting it for two years, finally got it.
[02:59:42.016 --> 02:59:44.138]  It's Immune Support from InfoWars Life.
[02:59:44.278 --> 02:59:48.622]  Elderberry, Echinacea, Astrologus Root, Angelica Root, and Lomatum Root.
[02:59:48.762 --> 02:59:50.864]  All of these are concentrated, cold-pressed.
[02:59:50.884 --> 02:59:52.505]  One of the top developers in the country.
[02:59:52.726 --> 02:59:54.467]  So good for adults, children, everybody.
[02:59:54.527 --> 02:59:58.931]  This is something you should be taking every day, 12 months out of the year, and it funds the InfoWars.
