[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000]  InfoWars.
[00:00:17.678 --> 00:00:19.279]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:23.761]  Oh, which way will we choose?
[00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:25.022]  We better hurry!
[00:00:25.322 --> 00:00:26.063]  Oh, hurry!
[00:00:26.163 --> 00:00:27.083]  Oh, hurry!
[00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:31.185]  Warn now, because we've got no time to lose!
[00:00:31.806 --> 00:00:34.507]  Some people got facts and claims.
[00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:38.329]  Some people got pride and shame.
[00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.711]  Some people got the flocks and the scheme.
[00:00:41.872 --> 00:00:44.493]  Some people got no aim, it seems.
[00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:48.882]  We're the Survivors!
[00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:53.763]  We're the Survivors!
[00:00:53.783 --> 00:00:54.123]  Yeah!
[00:00:54.183 --> 00:00:55.743]  The Black Survivors!
[00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:57.184]  Tell you what!
[00:00:57.324 --> 00:00:59.184]  We're the Survivors!
[00:01:00.084 --> 00:01:00.604]  Yeah!
[00:01:00.924 --> 00:01:02.565]  The Black Survivors!
[00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:03.845]  Yeah!
[00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:05.905]  We're the Survivors!
[00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:07.866]  Like Shedrock, Misha, Kenda, Benko!
[00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:11.606]  Rollin' the fire, but you never get burned!
[00:01:11.846 --> 00:01:13.086]  So I, I drink!
[00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.227]  I say string!
[00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:41.706]   We are the black sheep survivors. We are the black sheep survivors. We are the black sheep
[00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:44.346]  survivors.
[00:01:44.346 --> 00:01:48.347]  We are the survivors. In this age of technological humanity.
[00:01:48.347 --> 00:01:51.347]  We are survivors. Scientific atrocity.
[00:01:51.347 --> 00:01:53.347]  We are survivors.
[00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:57.904]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday, September 26th, worldwide broadcast.
[00:01:58.364 --> 00:01:59.145]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:01:59.165 --> 00:02:00.386]  We're going to have open phones today.
[00:02:00.406 --> 00:02:13.955]  We're going to cover the incredible historic moment we are in as evil is rising like a Saturn rocket into the sky and liberty is blasting off like the space shuttle into the sky at the very same time.
[00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:18.558]  We are here, live, in the face of the enemy.
[00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.121]  And there are global awakenings accelerating.
[00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:23.562]  I've been telling you about the last few months.
[00:02:24.082 --> 00:02:39.353]  We just saw Georgia Maloney, a patriot, an anti-globalist, anti-New World Order, anti-Klaus Schwab patriot, being called a Nazi, a fascist, and all these lies, winning in a landslide in Italy.
[00:02:40.754 --> 00:02:42.295]  And they are crapping their britches.
[00:02:42.315 --> 00:02:44.556]  The first Italian female president ever.
[00:02:45.397 --> 00:02:46.197]  And she's awesome.
[00:02:46.217 --> 00:02:47.198]  She's totally for real.
[00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:49.999]  They are scared as hell of her.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.261]  And it's not just Bolsonaro.
[00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:52.981]  It's not just her.
[00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:56.063]  More and more and more and more are coming.
[00:02:56.163 --> 00:02:59.163]  We have successfully triggered the chain reaction!
[00:02:59.163 --> 00:03:01.663]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:03:01.663 --> 00:03:03.163]  Woo!
[00:03:03.163 --> 00:03:06.163]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:03:06.163 --> 00:03:10.163]  Now, get ready for the enemy counter-defensive.
[00:03:10.163 --> 00:03:20.163]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:13.966]  They're gonna say terrorists cut the power off in Italy.
[00:03:15.127 --> 00:03:18.809]  They are going to launch massive wars, as they've already done.
[00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:38.521]   They are gonna pull out all of the stops, but every passing minute, every passing hour, every passing day, The people now know about the new world order and its horrible plans for all of us.
[00:03:38.961 --> 00:03:44.145]  And when the general population wakes up, and that's the next domino, we're already approaching 30-40%.
[00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:44.945]  Woo!
[00:03:44.985 --> 00:03:47.407]  I'm getting chills.
[00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:59.015]  We're already approaching the next domino to fall.
[00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:01.722]  And here's the great point of danger.
[00:04:01.822 --> 00:04:04.084]  The New World Order knows they are on the cusp of defeat.
[00:04:04.865 --> 00:04:06.026]  And so brace yourselves.
[00:04:06.687 --> 00:04:07.868]  Because the New World Order isn't coming.
[00:04:08.028 --> 00:04:08.789]  It's here.
[00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.491]  All over Europe, they're pulling down EU flags.
[00:04:13.013 --> 00:04:15.695]  All over Latin America, they're saying down with Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates.
[00:04:16.076 --> 00:04:17.537]  All over Asia, they're saying the same thing.
[00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:18.378]  In India.
[00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:20.160]  In America.
[00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:21.841]  In the UK.
[00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:22.522]  Everywhere.
[00:04:24.025 --> 00:04:40.195]  The people are unifying against the unelected head that you see on screen of the European Union that two days ago threatened the Italians with massive sanctions if they voted for this woman when she's an unelected pig.
[00:04:42.997 --> 00:04:49.997]  We're the survivors.
[00:04:49.997 --> 00:04:51.637]  It's on folks.
[00:04:51.702 --> 00:04:52.803]  The battle is now.
[00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.290]  And it's only going to get more intense.
[00:04:56.311 --> 00:04:57.851]  But bowing to tyranny will get you killed.
[00:04:57.691 --> 00:04:59.691]  Fighting back you'll live.
[00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:06.691]   In this age of technological humanity Scientific atrocity
[00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:12.691]   Atomic misphilosophy Nuclear mis-energy
[00:05:12.691 --> 00:05:20.691]   It's a world that forces lifelong insecurity Together now
[00:05:20.691 --> 00:05:30.691]   We're the survivors Yeah, we're the survivors
[00:05:30.691 --> 00:05:34.691]   All we gotta do Is survive
[00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:38.691]   And warn people that it's the globalists poisoning them with the GMO
[00:05:38.691 --> 00:05:42.531]   With the 5G, with the chemtrails, with the poison shots God.
[00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.152]  And as it becomes completely evident that the New World Order are psychotics that would make Hitler blush, they will be destroyed!
[00:05:51.793 --> 00:06:01.166]   They can only get away With these operations, ladies and gentlemen, if we don't know they're the ones behind it, if we expose they're the ones behind it, game over!
[00:06:01.686 --> 00:06:02.167]  Suckers!
[00:06:03.067 --> 00:06:04.768]  And that is happening.
[00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.072]  Alright, unbelievably important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:06:14.094 --> 00:06:21.238]  We have Italy rebelling against the EU dictatorship and openly being threatened with sanctions and border closures and total attacks.
[00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:29.011]   If they were to elect the first female populist leader in history, Georgia Maloney.
[00:06:29.011 --> 00:06:37.170]  Huge developments on that front.
[00:06:37.342 --> 00:06:40.984]  Massive escalations in the Russia-NATO war.
[00:06:42.205 --> 00:06:44.567]  And mass shootings, you name it, inside Russia.
[00:06:45.728 --> 00:06:46.969]  There's a globalist turn on there.
[00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:49.010]  Destabilization operations.
[00:06:49.971 --> 00:06:53.633]  Incredible statements by leaders in Spain and the U.S.
[00:06:54.494 --> 00:06:55.655]  promoting pedophilia.
[00:06:56.955 --> 00:07:01.458]  Spain's Minister of Equality says children should be able to have sex with adults.
[00:07:01.478 --> 00:07:02.099]  We have the video.
[00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.400]  I mean, these people are out in the open.
[00:07:08.023 --> 00:07:10.524]  We have why they're carrying out their depopulation operations.
[00:07:10.564 --> 00:07:11.265]  Are we getting into that?
[00:07:12.085 --> 00:07:16.808]  Billionaire bunkers, how the world's wealthiest are paying to escape reality that they helped create.
[00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:27.815]  Massive COVID-19 news, where more scientists, more top researchers, members of the FDA board, the fourth board they put in, have come out and said, don't take the shots, they're hurting people.
[00:07:28.396 --> 00:07:34.920]  I mean, a lot of positive stuff's happening, but you better know the new world order is going to strike back in in a big way.
[00:07:39.451 --> 00:07:44.473]  There is so much to get to and we're going to be covering it all here today and your phone calls.
[00:07:45.153 --> 00:07:51.435]  But let me just get to unelected official, the head of the EU, unelected.
[00:07:51.475 --> 00:07:55.397]  It was started as a steel combine in 56.
[00:07:57.317 --> 00:08:00.538]  And they later bragged in Bilderberg documents that it was going to be the European Union.
[00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:01.839]  And it's unelected.
[00:08:02.771 --> 00:08:10.738]  And then with treaties, with traitor presidents and prime ministers, they had sovereignty transferred to the European Union, unelected bureaucracy.
[00:08:11.239 --> 00:08:19.866]  Then they created a European Union parliament that has voting power, but is only advisory, or ceremonial, or vestigial.
[00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:22.769]  Toothless.
[00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.991]  Powerless.
[00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:26.032]  Other than a bully pulpit.
[00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:34.181]  But it was enough that they got, now, the majority of people in that parliament are anti-EU because the people want it.
[00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:37.942]  So the bully pulpit is actually powerful, though it was designed to be toothless.
[00:08:38.562 --> 00:08:47.024]  Unelected official, head of the EU, Ursula von der Leyen of the European Union, openly warns that if Italy votes for someone they disagree with, they will sanction Italy.
[00:08:47.044 --> 00:08:49.505]  And the Italians gave her the bird.
[00:08:49.565 --> 00:08:49.925]  Here it is.
[00:08:51.277 --> 00:08:55.438]  We'll see if things go in a difficult direction.
[00:08:55.558 --> 00:08:58.258]  I've spoken about Hungary and Poland.
[00:08:58.298 --> 00:09:00.679]  We have tools if things go in the right direction.
[00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:10.901]  And people as a body that is always, where always governments have to be accountable to, play an important role.
[00:09:12.981 --> 00:09:16.622]  So they're gonna sanction them and she went on to elaborate on that while speaking at Princeton.
[00:09:17.122 --> 00:09:20.583]  Here's some of the breathless establishment media, clip 5.
[00:09:22.142 --> 00:09:31.825]  On the eve of her victory, the anti-New World Order, anti-globalist, pro-populist, pro-capitalist new female leader of Italy, here they are demonizing her, calling her a fascist.
[00:09:31.865 --> 00:09:32.225]  Here it is.
[00:09:32.825 --> 00:09:36.567]  Voters in Italy tomorrow appear poised to make a hard right turn.
[00:09:36.907 --> 00:09:41.768]  The woman expected to become prime minister leads a party with roots in neo-fascism.
[00:09:42.168 --> 00:09:43.429]  Chris Livesey is in Rome.
[00:09:44.659 --> 00:09:56.791]  Italy is revered for its history, reflected in palazzos and ruins and statues, but not all of that history is beautiful, and many fear that one particularly ugly chapter could soon repeat itself.
[00:09:58.763 --> 00:10:09.887]  This year marks the 100th anniversary of Mussolini's historic march on Rome, plunging the country into two decades of dictatorship, an alliance with Hitler, and a second world war.
[00:10:09.907 --> 00:10:16.470]  Today, his fascist party is gone, but many say she is carrying the torch.
[00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.611]  Giorgia Maloney, leader of the Brothers of Italy.
[00:10:20.546 --> 00:10:31.535]  What was once a fringe party has ballooned into the biggest in the country, and it's now poised to lead the most hard-right government since World War II.
[00:10:32.415 --> 00:10:37.759]  The fundamental problem in Italy is becoming the illegal immigration.
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.641]  Too many immigrants.
[00:10:39.741 --> 00:10:45.746]  To protect the traditional family, a family composed by a mom, a dad, and sons.
[00:10:46.607 --> 00:10:52.652]  Italy's conservative superstar remains fiercely opposed to adoptions and surrogacy for same-sex couples.
[00:10:53.092 --> 00:10:58.917]  The fiery 45-year-old is comfortable with some of the hallmarks of Italian fascism, like this motto.
[00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:03.741]  God, fatherland and family.
[00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:09.826]  And that's clearly a post-fascist party with a post-fascist agenda.
[00:11:10.627 --> 00:11:14.350]  Irene Caratelli is a political scientist at Rome's American University.
[00:11:15.063 --> 00:11:24.051]  It has the flame in the symbol of the political party that goes back to the idea of the flame on the grave of Mussolini.
[00:11:24.591 --> 00:11:27.494]  The same flame is on Mussolini's grave?
[00:11:27.794 --> 00:11:28.014]  Yes.
[00:11:28.635 --> 00:11:34.420]  Now it's a historic election, also because Giorgia Maloney would be Italy's first ever female prime minister.
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.803]  An important glass ceiling, but one that's been overshadowed by her politics.
[00:11:39.224 --> 00:11:41.406]  Chris Livesey, CBS News, Rome.
[00:11:42.671 --> 00:11:46.593]  Oh my gosh, there's an eternal flame at JFK's tomb.
[00:11:46.633 --> 00:11:48.174]  There's an eternal flame of the Statue of Liberty.
[00:11:48.735 --> 00:11:51.116]  We get all those symbols from Rome.
[00:11:53.157 --> 00:11:57.440]  Meaning the flame of enlightenment, the flame of the city on the hill.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.043]  It's a Roman symbol, just like most of the symbols we have.
[00:12:03.103 --> 00:12:05.385]  Our buildings are Roman and Greek.
[00:12:06.345 --> 00:12:16.413]   The Romans got it from the Greeks, so the idea That because she has the symbol of a torch, and oh, there's a flame at Mussolini's grave, oh my gosh!
[00:12:16.773 --> 00:12:18.114]  Well, there's a flame anywhere.
[00:12:18.654 --> 00:12:20.095]  It's evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:22.097 --> 00:12:24.639]  Absolutely preposterous.
[00:12:25.663 --> 00:12:26.463]  But that's what they do.
[00:12:26.503 --> 00:12:29.664]  You know, the left now says, Christians in Europe and the U.S.
[00:12:29.684 --> 00:12:39.606]  that raise their hands to reach out to God, because God's a free will God, and if you're praying to God, whether you're alone or in public, try reaching your hands out, as I've said, to God, saying, I'm here.
[00:12:39.706 --> 00:12:40.886]  God will reach back, too.
[00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:41.486]  You'll feel it.
[00:12:41.726 --> 00:12:42.206]  It's real.
[00:12:42.586 --> 00:12:43.866]  It opens the connection of will.
[00:12:44.747 --> 00:12:46.687]  That, they now say, is a double Nazi salute.
[00:12:47.187 --> 00:12:48.327]  Burn in hell, globalists.
[00:12:48.347 --> 00:12:49.367]  You're so full of crap.
[00:12:50.668 --> 00:12:52.308]  You're absolutely disgusting.
[00:12:53.544 --> 00:12:59.270]  By the way, Mussolini was the leader of the Socialist Party, and then he double-crossed them and became the fascists.
[00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:05.416]  But they were the National Socialists, and Hitler modeled himself off the National Socialist Workers' Party.
[00:13:05.877 --> 00:13:06.898]  You may have heard of it.
[00:13:07.298 --> 00:13:09.781]  That's the acronym for NAZI.
[00:13:12.403 --> 00:13:14.345]  National Socialist Workers' Party.
[00:13:14.986 --> 00:13:16.768]  And in the German, it translates to Nazi.
[00:13:18.359 --> 00:13:26.726]  So they think you're stupid, they think you're dumb, and they call Donald Trump a Nazi, too, when he's got Jared Kushner, who's an Orthodox Jew.
[00:13:27.187 --> 00:13:31.951]  And I'm not against Israel, but Trump was a little too footsie with Israel for me.
[00:13:32.251 --> 00:13:35.674]  I don't want to be footsie with the UK, or Russia, or China, or anybody.
[00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:37.355]  I want America to be America.
[00:13:37.576 --> 00:13:45.036]   But the idea that Donald Trump is a Nazi Is like saying Martin Luther King's a grand dragon in the KKK.
[00:13:45.416 --> 00:13:48.157]  It's ridiculous horse crap!
[00:13:50.358 --> 00:13:51.579]  Just like they say, I'm a Nazi.
[00:13:52.179 --> 00:13:55.521]  It's, it's, they're the people using race to control people.
[00:13:56.261 --> 00:13:56.801]  You know that.
[00:13:57.061 --> 00:13:59.162]  They're the ones using race-based politics.
[00:14:00.223 --> 00:14:02.384]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:14:03.244 --> 00:14:11.168]  Everything they accuse us of is what they themselves are doing, and they know it, and they love it, and they think we're stupid, but we're not.
[00:14:11.832 --> 00:14:20.319]  More on this when we come back with the big Russian news, the economy news, the latest pedo news, just globalists running to bunkers as I told you, it's mainstream news.
[00:14:20.439 --> 00:14:22.060]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[00:14:24.642 --> 00:14:30.447]  But if we're awake and we're engaged and we're praying and we're doing it all, we can make it out of this.
[00:14:30.527 --> 00:14:33.309]  But believe me, if we don't, it only gets worse.
[00:14:34.338 --> 00:14:36.478]  It's not fun to hide and cower to tyranny.
[00:14:36.578 --> 00:14:37.899]  It's exhilarating to face it.
[00:14:38.239 --> 00:14:39.779]  We're doing it together, and you are.
[00:14:39.799 --> 00:14:41.520]  Tune into this broadcast and tip the spear.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:47.201]  And when you share the live links to InfoWars.com, Force Live Show, and Bandot Video, and share those articles and videos, you change the world.
[00:14:47.461 --> 00:14:48.121]  And I salute you.
[00:14:48.161 --> 00:14:55.463]  So this break, share the live link, InfoWars.com, Force Live Show, and the live show headline now, like your life depends on it, because it does.
[00:14:55.763 --> 00:14:57.043]  We're all in this together.
[00:15:01.812 --> 00:15:04.615]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:15:04.835 --> 00:15:05.195]  We think.
[00:15:05.215 --> 00:15:05.736]  Just let me think.
[00:15:05.756 --> 00:15:11.321]  I suspect, even now, orders are being shouted to telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:13.023]  It's Chancellor Settler.
[00:15:13.043 --> 00:15:13.363]  Damn it!
[00:15:13.403 --> 00:15:13.704]  Why?
[00:15:14.464 --> 00:15:20.490]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:15:21.071 --> 00:15:31.793]   Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen, The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:15:31.833 --> 00:15:32.814]  You designed it, sir.
[00:15:32.874 --> 00:15:33.795]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:15:33.815 --> 00:15:35.176]  You taught me every television in London.
[00:15:35.457 --> 00:15:38.940]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and depression.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:49.008]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[00:15:49.028 --> 00:15:49.169]  Cameras.
[00:15:49.209 --> 00:15:49.949]  We need cameras.
[00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.010]  How did this happen?
[00:15:51.671 --> 00:15:52.431]  Who's to blame?
[00:15:53.448 --> 00:15:56.051]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:15:56.071 --> 00:15:57.972]  They will be held accountable.
[00:15:57.992 --> 00:16:03.858]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:16:05.063 --> 00:16:06.864]  I know why you did it.
[00:16:07.045 --> 00:16:08.125]  I know you were afraid.
[00:16:08.546 --> 00:16:10.267]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:16:10.287 --> 00:16:10.347]  War?
[00:16:10.547 --> 00:16:10.987]  Terror?
[00:16:11.068 --> 00:16:11.848]  Disease?
[00:16:12.489 --> 00:16:18.293]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:16:18.913 --> 00:16:24.698]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:32.117]   He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:40.117]  There is a war.
[00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:40.871]  It's happening now.
[00:16:41.752 --> 00:16:43.553]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:16:44.114 --> 00:16:45.895]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:16:46.676 --> 00:16:48.177]  We are the Resistance.
[00:16:48.416 --> 00:16:50.416]  We are the Infowar.
[00:16:50.416 --> 00:16:56.416]  [Music]
[00:16:56.416 --> 00:16:58.416]  Why don't we talk about cryptocurrency?
[00:16:58.416 --> 00:17:00.416]  Okay.
[00:17:00.416 --> 00:17:08.416]   Because one of the ways that you encourage your audience to give you money is in cryptocurrency donations, right?
[00:17:08.726 --> 00:17:09.006]  Yes.
[00:17:09.627 --> 00:17:13.070]  And you have a page on your website that's just for cryptocurrency donations, right?
[00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.412]  InfoWars.com forward slash crypto.
[00:17:15.432 --> 00:17:17.995]  Is that a little advertisement just there?
[00:17:18.135 --> 00:17:19.176]  Well, we're fighting the deep state.
[00:17:19.196 --> 00:17:19.716]  We need money.
[00:17:19.916 --> 00:17:20.157]  All right.
[00:17:21.078 --> 00:17:21.738]  This is it.
[00:17:22.379 --> 00:17:23.280]  Give crypto.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.501]  Fund InfoWars.
[00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:28.493]  Sponsor us with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, right?
[00:17:29.013 --> 00:17:31.575]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight.
[00:17:31.595 --> 00:17:33.617]  Your advertisement for a cryptocurrency page.
[00:17:34.938 --> 00:17:39.362]  You know, I mean, I mean, people want to keep us in the fight.
[00:17:39.462 --> 00:17:42.685]  So I mean, I hope whoever the big whales are, they'll give us money before we keep going.
[00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:45.427]  We'll just keep, we'll just keep.
[00:17:45.467 --> 00:17:48.050]  Mincing money as you're in this courtroom.
[00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.592]  Let's move on.
[00:17:50.432 --> 00:17:52.432]  People care about the First Amendment.
[00:17:52.432 --> 00:17:56.432]  [Music]
[00:17:56.432 --> 00:18:01.432]   Globalists in full panic mode as nations choose populism over controlled collapse.
[00:18:01.725 --> 00:18:04.687]  Tune in now and learn how humanity takes back our planet.
[00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:06.768]  InfoWars.com, Timothy Speier.
[00:18:07.388 --> 00:18:26.580]  All right, I want to get to some of the speeches of this amazing lady that just got elected in Italy that scared the New World Order so much, the threatening EU sanctions, the intellectual bureaucracy against their country because they voted wrong, forcing them out in the open, making them act like the authoritarian dictators, the totalitarians that they are.
[00:18:27.662 --> 00:18:38.766]  Now, separately, it's very, very important for viewers and listeners to understand that the New World Order, the globalists, can be defeated right now.
[00:18:39.946 --> 00:18:43.908]  Or they can be partially slowed down, but then they will continue to launch their attacks forever.
[00:18:45.108 --> 00:18:46.669]  And they are very close to being defeated.
[00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:49.620]  People are awakening to who they are and their operations.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:56.403]  And so, right now, we have a really good chance to mitigate hell on earth in the coming years and decades.
[00:18:56.743 --> 00:18:58.464]  Doesn't mean all the problems will be solved.
[00:18:58.704 --> 00:19:05.887]  Doesn't mean there won't be AI issues and fragments of the New World Order and then it won't congeal later and come back with Satan at its head as the Bible says it will.
[00:19:07.386 --> 00:19:13.527]   We can be given a hundred year reprieve like Nineveh when Jonah was sent to awaken them.
[00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:16.985]  God gives us the choices to choose our own adventure.
[00:19:16.985 --> 00:19:20.086]   Like those books you read when you were a kid where they have three or four different endings
[00:19:20.086 --> 00:19:21.485]  depending on how you choose.
[00:19:21.485 --> 00:19:25.547]  And it's really up to us.
[00:19:25.547 --> 00:19:31.586]   So there is that Calvinistic system that I've definitely seen real where there's providence
[00:19:31.586 --> 00:19:39.406]   in God's plan, but God gives us the choice decide how that plan is fulfilled.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.620]  So, rolling over is hell on earth.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.822]  And even the new world is going to take over and do all this, and then Christ returns, and even that's about to happen the next 5-10 years.
[00:19:46.362 --> 00:19:48.422]  God wants us to challenge this and fight this.
[00:19:50.062 --> 00:19:52.963]  That's why the rapture, pre-tribulation rapture, is so bad.
[00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:56.664]  And I'm not demonizing folks that are into that, but it was popularized by mainstream media in the 80s.
[00:19:58.462 --> 00:19:59.923]  Of course, it's been around for over 150 years.
[00:20:00.303 --> 00:20:01.844]  It's because then you don't believe you have to do anything.
[00:20:02.804 --> 00:20:04.185]  Oh, we'll be raptured out of here.
[00:20:05.486 --> 00:20:17.332]  Well, Revelation says after the archangel binds Satan and puts him in the pit, and Christ returns, that the dead in Christ rise, the spirits, and meet him in the sky.
[00:20:18.753 --> 00:20:29.470]   Then there's a thousand year reign on Earth of Christ, and then for a very short time, Satan is released again and deceives another big group of people for one more test.
[00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:35.534]  That's what Revelation says a five-year-old can read that and know that and understand that.
[00:20:36.775 --> 00:20:39.337]  And boy, folks didn't know Revelation was so literal.
[00:20:39.498 --> 00:20:39.898]  It is.
[00:20:40.779 --> 00:20:53.429]   And whether you don't believe in God, the spiritual realm, and all the rest of this, the globalists do with their CERN, you know, interdimensional communication device, they admit, They've taken the plan of Revelation and used it like a blueprint.
[00:20:53.649 --> 00:20:54.589]  We've all seen the meme.
[00:20:55.190 --> 00:21:03.514]  Hey, you weren't supposed to use 1984 as an owner's manual, Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or George Soros.
[00:21:03.594 --> 00:21:06.956]  So, to them, it's an owner's manual and they're following it.
[00:21:06.976 --> 00:21:13.440]  But the Bible tells us the devil will follow Scripture and follow the plan.
[00:21:14.707 --> 00:21:16.208]  The devil knows he's going to lose in the end.
[00:21:16.468 --> 00:21:19.289]  And if this isn't good versus evil, then what is it?
[00:21:19.349 --> 00:21:21.830]  So we're closer to break.
[00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:27.752]  I'm going to come back and get into all this and play these clips and get into Russia and all the rest of it.
[00:21:27.772 --> 00:21:29.213]  But let me just say this right now to the listeners.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.181]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[00:21:31.221 --> 00:21:31.982]  We've been through hell.
[00:21:32.523 --> 00:21:34.244]  We've stood directly up against the deep state.
[00:21:34.264 --> 00:21:37.488]  They've had the FBI, the CIA on record running all these attacks.
[00:21:37.528 --> 00:21:38.349]  It's come out in the news.
[00:21:38.989 --> 00:21:42.733]  Mainstream news today, they're targeting Trump supporters and leaders and InfoWars.
[00:21:43.094 --> 00:21:44.315]  But we have the populace.
[00:21:44.335 --> 00:21:44.775]  We have you.
[00:21:45.496 --> 00:21:52.040]  So if you'll just spread the word about the broadcast, if you'll just pray for us, and if you'll just buy the products at InfoWareStore.com, we can continue on.
[00:21:52.301 --> 00:21:54.042]  But I gotta tell you, I declared bankruptcy.
[00:21:54.482 --> 00:22:00.766]  Not the type where you get shut down and they liquidate everything, but Chapter 5, to keep a business, that's what they see this as, going.
[00:22:01.727 --> 00:22:04.689]  And sure, under this operation, I get paid almost nothing.
[00:22:05.953 --> 00:22:08.015]  But that's okay, because I just want to keep it going.
[00:22:08.335 --> 00:22:16.644]  And so, your money's going when you buy products to keep this on the air, and then after the bankruptcy is determined, they'll create some settlement with all these rigged lawsuits.
[00:22:17.284 --> 00:22:21.549]  But that's not where your money's going to go, because there is no extra money at this point.
[00:22:21.769 --> 00:22:27.675]  In fact, we've dipped back into the red, and so I'm asking listeners, for all your past support, and I appreciate you and I thank you.
[00:22:28.235 --> 00:22:29.596]  We are caught up on shipping.
[00:22:29.696 --> 00:22:30.876]  The books have all been shipped out.
[00:22:31.136 --> 00:22:32.076]  We got a few weeks behind.
[00:22:32.096 --> 00:22:33.177]  That's never happened in our history.
[00:22:33.417 --> 00:22:34.397]  We are caught up now.
[00:22:34.457 --> 00:22:35.758]  So if you order products, you will get them.
[00:22:36.038 --> 00:22:36.638]  We are shipping.
[00:22:36.678 --> 00:22:39.639]  If you order in the morning, same day in most cases.
[00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:43.540]  We're not as good as Amazon, but we're close and we promote liberty and freedom.

[00:23:45.326 --> 00:23:53.326]  [Music]
[00:23:53.326 --> 00:23:58.326]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:23:58.384 --> 00:24:08.349]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:15.993]  We are back, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide on this live Monday edition.
[00:24:16.073 --> 00:24:24.059]   Huge developments in Russia, massive developments in the COVID front, and Incredible intrigue unfolding in Communist China right now.
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.586]  We don't just have elections coming up in Brazil for Bolsonaro to be re-elected.
[00:24:29.187 --> 00:24:30.308]  We don't just have in Sweden.
[00:24:32.728 --> 00:24:34.749]  Right-wing anti-New World Order folks getting elected.
[00:24:34.769 --> 00:24:47.498]  We don't just have in Canada the new leader of the Conservative Party that polls show would destroy Trudeau in a national election right now coming to power who speak out against Klaus Schwab, who speak out against Bill Gates, who speak out against the New World Order.
[00:24:48.198 --> 00:24:54.122]  We don't just have all this and so much more going on with Italy electing an anti-globalist.
[00:24:54.623 --> 00:25:05.315]   We have another election taking place and this is by the Central Committee and the Politburo A few thousand people get to vote in China, not their billion, four hundred million.
[00:25:06.355 --> 00:25:09.036]  And if they don't vote, they get executed or put in prison.
[00:25:09.776 --> 00:25:14.298]  And that's Xi Jinping, who is set to be elected permanent dictator.
[00:25:15.838 --> 00:25:17.019]  You go, well, how's he elected dictator?
[00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:24.441]  Well, when a Politburo, when a bunch of oligarchs, plutocrats elect you to be the dictator, you are the dictator.
[00:25:24.921 --> 00:25:27.142]  Like the Roman Senate voting to make Caesar a dictator.
[00:25:28.222 --> 00:25:29.583]  Yes, Hitler was elected as well.
[00:25:30.848 --> 00:25:32.228]  Then they use the election to take over.
[00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:35.149]  Is Xi Jinping missing?
[00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.270]  Rumors of military coup in China explained.
[00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:40.351]  They have shut down a lot of the trains nationally.
[00:25:40.391 --> 00:25:41.311]  A bunch of folks have been arrested.
[00:25:41.992 --> 00:25:42.992]  And it goes on from there.
[00:25:43.052 --> 00:25:43.552]  Fact check.
[00:25:43.632 --> 00:25:44.672]  Is China having a coup?
[00:25:44.792 --> 00:25:46.253]  And is Xi Jinping under house arrest?
[00:25:46.553 --> 00:25:47.413]  Here's what we know.
[00:25:48.394 --> 00:25:52.035]  China becomes hothouse of intrigue out of critical Communist Party Congress.
[00:25:53.155 --> 00:25:55.336]  And it goes on from there.
[00:25:55.816 --> 00:26:02.575]   So we don't know right now, but that's the election that they're having for dictatorship.
[00:26:02.575 --> 00:26:06.456]   So continuing, I wanna play a clip here that I mentioned earlier.
[00:26:06.456 --> 00:26:09.395]  We'll get to the big Russian news, Edward Snowden news.
[00:26:09.395 --> 00:26:17.115]   And this is Georgia, the new leader Maloney, who is anti-New World Order all the way.
[00:26:17.115 --> 00:26:22.995]   And she asked in a powerful speech that has subtitles, I'm gonna read, "Why is the family an enemy?"
[00:26:22.848 --> 00:26:23.789]  Because it defines us.
[00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:24.749]  It's our identity.
[00:26:24.869 --> 00:26:26.771]  Everything that defines us is now the enemy.
[00:26:27.131 --> 00:26:29.052]  We will defend God, country, and family.
[00:26:29.533 --> 00:26:30.873]  Now that's an American slogan.
[00:26:30.974 --> 00:26:32.254]  It's a Brazilian slogan.
[00:26:32.555 --> 00:26:33.575]  It's a German slogan.
[00:26:33.675 --> 00:26:35.337]  It's an ancient slogan of the West.
[00:26:36.257 --> 00:26:38.198]  God, country, family.
[00:26:38.579 --> 00:26:40.300]  Or some say God, family, country.
[00:26:42.301 --> 00:26:44.543]  In Brazil, I think it's God, family, country.
[00:26:44.843 --> 00:26:45.423]  And I would agree.
[00:26:45.443 --> 00:26:48.486]  It should go God, family, country, not God, country, family.
[00:26:49.546 --> 00:26:52.168]  But every country has this.
[00:26:53.509 --> 00:26:54.310]  In the Western culture.
[00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.291]  Hitler took it and twisted it, to be fair.
[00:26:56.832 --> 00:26:58.773]  Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer.
[00:26:59.794 --> 00:27:01.936]  Ein Volk, one people.
[00:27:02.796 --> 00:27:04.918]  Ein Reich, one land.
[00:27:05.938 --> 00:27:07.660]  Ein Führer, one leader.
[00:27:09.601 --> 00:27:10.162]  That's twisted.
[00:27:10.202 --> 00:27:10.522]  It's not...
[00:27:12.691 --> 00:27:15.432]  Under God, under family, under country.
[00:27:16.733 --> 00:27:19.194]  He said, one people, one land, one leader.
[00:27:20.995 --> 00:27:21.655]  One dictatorship.
[00:27:22.455 --> 00:27:23.055]  She didn't say that.
[00:27:24.956 --> 00:27:30.859]  She said, one people, one God, one country, one people.
[00:27:32.339 --> 00:27:34.160]  And so I'm gonna do my best, she talks fast.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.901]  I talk fast too like the Italians, she talks even faster.
[00:27:37.501 --> 00:27:43.946]   I'm gonna do my best to read these subtitles because again, A lot of listeners go, hey, we can read, dude.
[00:27:44.666 --> 00:27:48.950]  We have 400 plus radio affiliates, so most of them don't speak Italian.
[00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:50.511]  So I certainly don't.
[00:27:51.152 --> 00:27:55.515]  I guess it's a romantic language, so whether you speak Spanish or Italian, they can understand each other.
[00:27:55.555 --> 00:27:58.377]  But I don't have a romantic background.
[00:27:58.418 --> 00:28:02.221]  I have a Germanic language background.
[00:28:02.261 --> 00:28:10.399]   That's what British is, a Germanic Multi-Mongol language of about six different Germanic tongues, but I digress.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.180]  Not a linguist, that's just the history of it.
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:13.320]  Let's go ahead and roll it.
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:13.780]  Here it is.
[00:28:15.901 --> 00:28:20.082]  This is about what we are doing here today.
[00:28:22.563 --> 00:28:23.583]  Why is the family an enemy?
[00:28:23.964 --> 00:28:28.085]  Why is the family so frightening?
[00:28:28.105 --> 00:28:29.865]  There is a single answer to all these questions.
[00:28:29.885 --> 00:28:30.746]  Because it defines us.
[00:28:31.666 --> 00:28:32.406]  Because it is our identity.
[00:28:36.997 --> 00:28:39.598]  Because everything, everything that defines us is now the enemy.
[00:28:40.678 --> 00:28:55.683]  For those who would like us to no longer have an identity, and to simply be perfect consumer slaves.
[00:28:58.404 --> 00:29:02.546]  And so, they attack national identity, they attack religious identity.
[00:29:04.261 --> 00:29:06.523]  They attack gender identity, they attack family identity.
[00:29:06.543 --> 00:29:08.464]  I can't define myself as an Italian, Christian, woman, mother, no!
[00:29:08.504 --> 00:29:10.586]  I must be citizen X, gender X, parent 1, parent 2, I must be a number.
[00:29:10.405 --> 00:29:20.286]   I can't define myself as an Italian, Christian woman, mother, no.
[00:29:20.286 --> 00:29:24.566]  I must be citizen X, gender X, parent 1, parent 2.
[00:29:24.566 --> 00:29:27.964]  I must be a number.
[00:29:27.964 --> 00:29:35.525]   Because when I am only a number, when I no longer have an identity or roots, then I will
[00:29:35.525 --> 00:29:38.525]  be a perfect slave at the mercy of financial speculators.
[00:29:38.596 --> 00:29:39.597]  The perfect consumer.
[00:29:39.617 --> 00:29:40.518]  That's the reason why.
[00:29:40.538 --> 00:29:42.159]  That's why we inspire so much fear.
[00:29:41.979 --> 00:29:49.538]  The perfect consumer.
[00:29:49.538 --> 00:29:54.498]  That's the reason why.
[00:29:54.498 --> 00:29:56.337]  That's why we inspire so much fear.
[00:29:56.337 --> 00:30:00.578]  That's why this event inspires so much fear.
[00:30:00.578 --> 00:30:11.939]   Because we do not want to be numbers, we will defend the value of the human being.
[00:30:11.974 --> 00:30:16.197]  Every single human being, because each of us has a unique genetic code that is unrepeatable.
[00:30:16.217 --> 00:30:23.361]  And like it or not, that is sacred.
[00:30:23.401 --> 00:30:24.041]  We will defend it.
[00:30:24.161 --> 00:30:26.103]  We will defend God, country, and family.
[00:30:28.604 --> 00:30:35.729]  Those things that disgust people so much, we will do it to defend our freedom.
[00:30:36.289 --> 00:30:36.570]  Yes.
[00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:44.375]  Because we will never be slaves and simple consumers at the mercy of financial speculators.
[00:30:44.194 --> 00:30:58.314]  This is our mission, this is why I came here today.
[00:30:58.314 --> 00:31:00.594]  Chesterton wrote more than a century ago.
[00:31:00.592 --> 00:31:01.453]  Let's see if I can find it.
[00:31:01.493 --> 00:31:04.996]  Fires will be kindled to testify that two and two make four.
[00:31:04.816 --> 00:31:08.816]  Let's see if I can find it.
[00:31:08.816 --> 00:31:16.895]  Fires will be kindled to testify that two and two make four.
[00:31:16.895 --> 00:31:26.654]   Swords will be drawn to prove that leaves are green in summer.
[00:31:27.583 --> 00:31:28.063]  We are ready.
[00:31:28.143 --> 00:31:28.504]  Thank you.
[00:31:29.304 --> 00:31:35.530]  Bravo!
[00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:37.031]  And let me tell you something.
[00:31:37.872 --> 00:31:43.396]  You could take that two-minute speech and teach a master class on reality.
[00:31:44.637 --> 00:31:46.419]  She attacks the central bankers that run it all.
[00:31:46.759 --> 00:31:52.004]  She explains they want to destroy our very identity and who we are to take us over and control us, to finally kill us.
[00:31:53.396 --> 00:32:01.485]  She explains that that's why it's total war and why these foundations of humanity are our defense because it's the very process of what makes us who we are.
[00:32:03.827 --> 00:32:05.609]  This was extremely powerful.
[00:32:05.649 --> 00:32:06.670]  They'll probably assassinate her.
[00:32:07.911 --> 00:32:08.752]  They're extremely scared.
[00:32:08.772 --> 00:32:09.513]  You can just look at her.
[00:32:09.533 --> 00:32:10.534]  You can look in her eyes.
[00:32:10.574 --> 00:32:11.035]  You can hear her.
[00:32:11.055 --> 00:32:11.696]  You can look at her past.
[00:32:12.016 --> 00:32:12.897]  She is an angel.
[00:32:14.025 --> 00:32:14.765]  She is real.
[00:32:15.266 --> 00:32:16.106]  She is amazing.
[00:32:16.446 --> 00:32:23.070]  And she scares the living hell out of these Satanists that want us to be their slaves because they want to mount our collective head on a wall.
[00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:31.095]  But we will not let them do it and we will not surrender because surrender is a thousand times worse than fighting back.
[00:32:31.396 --> 00:32:33.237]  There is no choice but to resist.
[00:32:33.678 --> 00:32:35.579]  Victory is resistance.
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.781]  Resistance is victory.
[00:32:38.121 --> 00:32:39.022]  We have a culture.
[00:32:39.102 --> 00:32:39.703]  We're human.
[00:32:40.003 --> 00:32:40.904]  Made in the image of God.
[00:32:40.944 --> 00:32:43.966]  We're each individuals with an amazing destiny.
[00:32:44.227 --> 00:32:45.287]  We believe in ourselves.
[00:32:45.327 --> 00:32:47.850]  We love ourselves because we love the God that made us.
[00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.793]  And we will be part of the animating contest of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[00:32:52.153 --> 00:32:58.239]   And as she said, There will be fires and war just to say 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.485]  Swords will be drawn to say that leaves are green in summer.
[00:33:02.369 --> 00:33:11.875]  Because that's what the authoritarians do, is attack basic common sense and logic, because to submit to tyranny takes suspending logic and being a fool!
[00:33:12.096 --> 00:33:25.344]  To say two men can have a baby, or to say pedophilia is good, or to say open borders is good, or to say communism is good, you have to wage war on your common sense, and your own life force, and your own forces of self-preservation.
[00:33:25.644 --> 00:33:30.204]   Well I call for the age of human supremacy and building a world that's pro-human.
[00:33:30.204 --> 00:33:33.004]  And you just heard the new leader of Italy repeat that.
[00:33:33.004 --> 00:33:51.324]  I'll be completely honest with you ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:51.593 --> 00:33:54.754]  I knew that I was right 30 years ago when I started working to get on air.
[00:33:55.854 --> 00:33:58.654]  And I knew the New World Order was going to unfold because I was reading their own documents.
[00:34:00.215 --> 00:34:00.915]  I was researching.
[00:34:01.718 --> 00:34:07.983]  And because I had family and others around me that had seen the inside of the system.
[00:34:08.023 --> 00:34:09.143]  They were telling me it was real.
[00:34:10.665 --> 00:34:14.227]  And I saw everything the globalists wanted 25 years ago, they were getting.
[00:34:14.908 --> 00:34:17.449]  And so I knew that they were systematically taking over.
[00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:22.153]  So I knew where they were taking us of global depopulation and hell on earth was a real place.
[00:34:23.354 --> 00:34:24.354]  And I didn't want to go there.
[00:34:25.475 --> 00:34:30.178]  I remember when I was about 16, my sister was about three years old.
[00:34:31.301 --> 00:34:40.249]  And I was still living at the house of my parents, and we put in a DVD, I think DVDs were out then, or a VHS, of Beetlejuice.
[00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:46.854]  And she walks in and she sees the scene where they're in the waiting room for eternity, and there's these shrunken head people.
[00:34:46.874 --> 00:34:49.597]  And it's kind of scary.
[00:34:50.337 --> 00:34:53.420]  And my dad's saying, yeah, maybe you should turn this off, your sister shouldn't be watching it.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:59.385]  And before we could turn it off, she looked at me and she said, Bubba, don't take me there.
[00:35:01.631 --> 00:35:05.656]  Because, you know, she's like three years old, and she's seeing this scary thing in Beetlejuice.
[00:35:05.916 --> 00:35:06.677]  Yeah, it was this scene.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.261]  With Alec Baldwin.
[00:35:12.022 --> 00:35:13.904]  And she said, don't take me there.
[00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:14.785]  Bubba?
[00:35:15.126 --> 00:35:15.846]  She calls me Bubba.
[00:35:17.308 --> 00:35:18.629]  Please don't take me there.
[00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:20.631]  Great job, crew, finding that so fast.
[00:35:20.651 --> 00:35:21.793]  I didn't tell you I was going to talk about that.
[00:35:23.522 --> 00:35:26.084]  And, but see, this wasn't a fantasy when I was three years old.
[00:35:26.725 --> 00:35:28.206]  This was when I was 20 years old.
[00:35:28.947 --> 00:35:38.515]  Knowing they were doing it, knowing what they had planned decades before, in Brzezinski books I'd read, that he'd written decades before that I'd just read, that what he said they'd do 20 years before, they did.
[00:35:38.896 --> 00:35:44.256]   And so then I was reading books they'd written then in like 1994, 95.
[00:35:44.256 --> 00:35:51.936]  I guess when I was 16 like 1990, 91 that had come true.
[00:35:52.129 --> 00:35:55.611]  So I'm like, wait, they wrote these books 20-30 years ago and now I'm living it?
[00:35:56.671 --> 00:36:01.794]  Wow, they're really going to be able to carry this out.
[00:36:05.916 --> 00:36:06.797]  And that's where we are.
[00:36:08.007 --> 00:36:09.928]  My sister said to me, Bubba, don't take me there.
[00:36:10.488 --> 00:36:13.150]  Well, I'm saying to all you folks, please don't take me there.
[00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:14.531]  Please, I don't want to take you there.
[00:36:14.551 --> 00:36:22.315]  The only way we stop going there, the next leg of this hellish journey, is getting right with God and saying no to this.
[00:36:23.615 --> 00:36:27.477]  So, got a lot of big Russia news with the escalating war.
[00:36:27.557 --> 00:36:32.240]  And yes, Russia, fighting NATO forces in a trap, has been losing.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:33.761]  Russia's been losing.
[00:36:34.625 --> 00:36:41.088]  And now Putin, as I said he would do months ago, called up 300,000 troops and heavier equipment and class A military.
[00:36:41.348 --> 00:36:42.669]  He was using his lower level stuff before.
[00:36:42.689 --> 00:36:43.749]  He's also getting conscripts.
[00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:48.491]  And now NATO's saying nuclear war could happen very easily.
[00:36:48.551 --> 00:36:49.592]  Putin says it's no bluff.
[00:36:49.992 --> 00:36:50.952]  Nuclear war could happen.
[00:36:50.992 --> 00:36:55.174]  I mean, we're actually talking about this in the fall of 2022.
[00:36:55.214 --> 00:36:55.854]  This is happening now.
[00:36:59.485 --> 00:37:03.167]  And then you add to all of this that people think Putin will be defeated.
[00:37:03.487 --> 00:37:05.708]  He militarily could be defeated conventionally.
[00:37:06.529 --> 00:37:12.652]  But as they say in the movie War Games, the only way to win this game is not to play when you're talking about hydrogen bombs and missiles.
[00:37:16.134 --> 00:37:16.975]  And suitcase nukes.
[00:37:18.856 --> 00:37:20.517]  And so that's where we are now.
[00:37:22.318 --> 00:37:25.319]  And I wouldn't say we're two minutes to midnight.
[00:37:25.339 --> 00:37:28.061]  We're two seconds from midnight on the doomsday clock.
[00:37:29.071 --> 00:37:31.773]  And Europe wants a destabilization.
[00:37:32.013 --> 00:37:32.994]  They want a great reset.
[00:37:33.034 --> 00:37:36.676]  They wanted, as Klaus Schwab said a year and a half ago, carbon lockdowns.
[00:37:37.017 --> 00:37:38.077]  And now they're saying, isn't it great?
[00:37:38.097 --> 00:37:42.300]  There's no fuel or no gas, so we'll just have a post-industrial world.
[00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:46.083]  Russia's making double profits what they were making just a year ago.
[00:37:47.884 --> 00:37:50.286]  Russia's paying a price in blood, but not financially.
[00:37:52.952 --> 00:37:59.215]  And so those that think Putin will be defeated are naive, because it's economic war, and the West is losing.
[00:37:59.536 --> 00:38:01.777]  The problem is the globalists want the West to lose.
[00:38:04.618 --> 00:38:12.243]  In other Russia news, Putin, this just broke InfoWars.com, Putin gives Edward Snowden Russian citizenship, state media reports.
[00:38:12.803 --> 00:38:14.984]  Within months after Russia invaded Ukraine, some in the U.S.
[00:38:15.004 --> 00:38:17.626]  media began to question, where is Edward Snowden?
[00:38:17.646 --> 00:38:20.007]  Whistleblower, silence since Russia invaded Ukraine.
[00:38:21.511 --> 00:38:30.155]  As one April Newsweek headline read, the Ukraine offensive had clearly put the NSA whistleblower in deeply awkward position, and thus he went relatively silent on Twitter.
[00:38:30.655 --> 00:38:40.439]  The Russian government has provided him asylum since he fled there from Hong Kong in 2013, as he was wanted man for exposing illegal mass domestic spying by the NSA and U.S.
[00:38:40.479 --> 00:38:40.979]  intelligence.
[00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:49.737]   On Monday, Russian state media in its Media is out with an explosive headline and a new development regarding Snowden's fate.
[00:38:50.138 --> 00:38:55.560]  Putin signs decree granting Snowden Russian citizenship according to state-run RAI.
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:01.502]  TASS is reporting that Putin has given Snowden Russian citizenship.
[00:39:03.523 --> 00:39:04.483]  So you have that news there.
[00:39:05.163 --> 00:39:05.984]  Here's some of the headlines.
[00:39:06.024 --> 00:39:09.065]  The view that Russia will lose war in Ukraine may be naive.
[00:39:11.875 --> 00:39:13.756]  Italy has rejected EU's war with Russia.
[00:39:13.776 --> 00:39:16.316]  A shock election rocks Great Reset agenda.
[00:39:16.897 --> 00:39:23.459]  Despite all of this, the economy of Europe continues to plunge.
[00:39:23.919 --> 00:39:33.662]  Desperate Russia... Desperate Russian shoots recruitment officer instead of sign up to fight in Ukraine.
[00:39:35.017 --> 00:39:43.965]  While many Russians have opted to flee the country to dodge Vladimir Putin's desperate draft for the war in Ukraine, one man took his protest a little bit further and shot a recruitment officer.
[00:39:44.385 --> 00:39:51.491]  Local authorities announced Monday's attack, which unfolded in the city of Olmstey in, I can't pronounce all this, region of Siberia.
[00:39:51.891 --> 00:40:02.280]  The video of the incident inside an enlistment office appears to show a gunman dressed in military fatigues firing on the official at point-blank range, causing other potential draftees to flee the room.
[00:40:03.587 --> 00:40:04.127]  Here's another one.
[00:40:04.608 --> 00:40:04.888]  U.S.
[00:40:04.908 --> 00:40:07.830]  warns Russia of catastrophic consequences of nuclear strike.
[00:40:08.191 --> 00:40:09.151]  French news agency.
[00:40:09.772 --> 00:40:13.455]  Russia military recruitment centers attacked amid mobilization pushback.
[00:40:13.815 --> 00:40:14.536]  Multiple attacks.
[00:40:14.916 --> 00:40:15.536]  Lights out.
[00:40:15.957 --> 00:40:16.497]  Ovens off.
[00:40:16.657 --> 00:40:19.079]  Europe preps for winter energy crisis.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:25.124]  Seven kids dead as Columbine inspired maniac storms school with hate.
[00:40:26.547 --> 00:40:28.409]  So, all hell, as they say, is breaking loose.
[00:40:28.429 --> 00:40:29.289]  Pray for peace.
[00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:31.109]  At least 15 people have died, including 11 children.
[00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:37.109]   About 24 have been injured after a man in a black t-shirt and balaclava opened fire on students at a school in Russia.
[00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:43.128]   The gunman, who was armed with two flare guns, which have been converted to fire live ammunition, according to
[00:40:43.128 --> 00:40:44.109]  Russian media.
[00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:53.109]  So all hell, as they say, is breaking loose.
[00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:56.109]  Pray for peace. Pray for justice.
[00:40:56.109 --> 00:41:03.548]   Roger Waters, the Ukrainian government's called for his assassination, the head of Pink Floyd, who's a famous anti-war
[00:41:03.548 --> 00:41:07.109]   guy, has just called for peace and for Russia and the West to make a deal.
[00:41:07.897 --> 00:41:08.778]  And I've called for that too.
[00:41:11.119 --> 00:41:14.721]  Well, now they're trying to cancel his concerts in Europe because he's done that.
[00:41:15.821 --> 00:41:20.824]  Since when are people calling for peace, the bad guys, when it can end our world as we know it?
[00:41:22.273 --> 00:41:39.928]  I want to give the toll-free number out next hour to talk about the Italian election, to talk about populist victories worldwide, to talk about the Russia crisis, to talk about 43 days of the midterms, the deep state says patriots are about to shoot people and blow stuff up any minute, obviously preparing false flags for provocateur operations.
[00:41:41.909 --> 00:41:42.810]  It's a free-for-all.
[00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:46.733]  Totally open phones for first-time callers.
[00:41:47.834 --> 00:41:48.975]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789.
[00:41:52.282 --> 00:41:52.803]  877-789-2539.
[00:41:52.823 --> 00:41:53.824]  877-789-2539.
[00:41:53.924 --> 00:42:01.010]  We will take your calls on this live Monday broadcast.
[00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.790]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:42:02.971 --> 00:42:08.616]  I look forward to talking to you about all of these issues.
[00:42:08.676 --> 00:42:10.918]  But this is what happens when major wars start.
[00:42:12.694 --> 00:42:16.018]  That's what globalism is, is economic, cultural, asymmetrical warfare.
[00:42:16.498 --> 00:42:20.163]  Economic warfare, cultural warfare, degradation, demoralization.
[00:42:20.483 --> 00:42:22.365]  But they always lead to big physical conflicts.
[00:42:23.847 --> 00:42:25.289]  China's locked down a bunch of its railways.
[00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:26.330]  Major cities are locked down.
[00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:28.933]  There's reports of coups inside China.
[00:42:29.333 --> 00:42:30.454]  Wars and rumors of wars.
[00:42:30.815 --> 00:42:32.277]  This is the birthing pains.
[00:42:33.404 --> 00:42:36.185]  For something much, much larger that's obviously coming.
[00:42:36.286 --> 00:42:44.850]  And we have Jen Psaki saying, on the upcoming midterms elections, former top Biden spokesperson admits, it was a referendum on the president, Democrats will lose.
[00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:49.192]  That's why they're making a referendum that Republicans are white supremacists and terrorists.
[00:42:50.953 --> 00:42:56.516]  We have major world leaders, major heads of government agencies in the US and Europe calling for pedophilia.
[00:42:56.556 --> 00:42:57.577]  That's coming up next hour.
[00:42:57.637 --> 00:42:59.598]  I mean, these people are taking the mask off.
[00:43:01.243 --> 00:43:01.743]  We're going to break.
[00:43:01.763 --> 00:43:03.164]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:43:03.765 --> 00:43:05.206]  Remember, your word of mouth is paramount.

[00:43:41.315 --> 00:43:44.938]  Thank you all for your past support, but now, number one book in the world.
[00:43:45.518 --> 00:43:46.799]  All these patriots getting elected.
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:48.341]  Humanity fighting back and waking up.
[00:43:48.401 --> 00:43:51.764]  It's so close, but we've got to fight harder now than ever.
[00:43:51.864 --> 00:43:52.544]  I'm not giving up.
[00:43:52.845 --> 00:43:56.528]  I want to thank you for not giving up, and in fact, doubling and redoubling your efforts.
[00:43:57.248 --> 00:44:02.248]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:44:02.248 --> 00:44:06.048]  Tomorrow's news today goes into hour number two.
[00:44:06.048 --> 00:44:08.947]  Your phone calls and tons of breaking news straight ahead.
[00:44:08.947 --> 00:44:13.528]  (upbeat music)
[00:44:25.728 --> 00:44:30.268]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:44:30.268 --> 00:44:33.748]  (upbeat music)
[00:44:33.748 --> 00:44:36.327]  (upbeat music)
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:55.463]  With our government guilty of pushing a deadly experimental vaccine, robbing the nation of its wealth, and starting a war with Russia, who has a superior nuclear weapons arsenal, one has to ask, be it angry mobs or atom bombs, where do these crooks plan on escaping the fallout?
[00:44:55.543 --> 00:45:01.224]  Denver is now handing out free bug-out bags to help you just in case you run into emergency.
[00:45:01.264 --> 00:45:05.965]  Lisa, alright, I asked you last time, I need to know the checklist of everything I gotta put in my bug-out bag.
[00:45:06.685 --> 00:45:09.608]  Toilet paper, paper towels, toilet paper, paper towels.
[00:45:09.648 --> 00:45:10.770]  We've got cotton balls.
[00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:14.173]  Two opportunities to get these free emergency preparedness bags.
[00:45:14.213 --> 00:45:18.237]  So, really an important effort, especially when we're talking about severe weather.
[00:45:18.258 --> 00:45:26.967]  Yeah, and I know a lot of people are going to go and get those bags, but for people who maybe can't make it out there, is there anything in there that's, you know, too tough that you couldn't just put one of those together yourself?
[00:45:27.427 --> 00:45:29.850]  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff you could easily put together yourself.
[00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:33.693]  I mean, if you got any extra cotton balls, you know, paper towels, toilet paper.
[00:45:33.733 --> 00:45:41.000]  The city of Denver is letting the locals know they should be prepared for an unexpected order to get out of town in a hurry.
[00:45:41.341 --> 00:45:46.286]  And many people are connecting dots between this and the Denver International Airport.
[00:45:47.066 --> 00:45:58.352]  The Denver International Airport has long been rumored to be sitting atop an underground military base built deep beneath the surface and connected to several other underground bases.
[00:45:58.672 --> 00:46:01.874]  These rumors are the result of several interesting facts.
[00:46:02.714 --> 00:46:16.736]  From 1995 until he was found dead a year later, Phil Schneider gave dozens of lectures claiming to be a geological engineer hired to build deep underground military bases known as DUMs for the U.S.
[00:46:16.776 --> 00:46:17.157]  government.
[00:46:18.158 --> 00:46:26.701]  His father was Captain Oscar Schneider, a former Nazi stationed in Florida working black operations for naval intelligence.
[00:46:27.542 --> 00:46:31.883]  Phil Schneider was showing samples of what he claimed were unknown exotic metals.
[00:46:32.424 --> 00:46:43.168]  He provided maps of the underground dumps and showed off dramatic scars that he claimed were from a violent skirmish with a non-human species deep underground.
[00:46:44.028 --> 00:46:51.111]  In January of 1996, Schneider was found dead in his home, days after he mysteriously died of strangulation.
[00:46:51.572 --> 00:46:55.053]  Investigations were never completed, and it was ruled a suicide.
[00:46:55.333 --> 00:46:56.834]  His evidence went missing.
[00:46:57.314 --> 00:47:11.121]  Before he died, Phil Schneider used his clearance to take investigative author Alex Christopher into the top underground levels of the Denver Airport, where they took pictures of a long road heading off to multiple destinations.
[00:47:11.881 --> 00:47:20.527]  Built upon 53 square miles of land, 25 miles from downtown, the Denver Airport was billions of dollars over budget.
[00:47:21.007 --> 00:47:28.532]  Different contractors were hired for each section, some of whom have come forward and claimed it would take days to show you what's down there.
[00:47:29.233 --> 00:47:40.180]  Inside the otherwise unimpressive airport, there is a capstone with cryptic Illuminati and Masonic imagery marking a time capsule buried beneath to be opened in 2094.
[00:47:42.081 --> 00:47:53.706]  The airport opened with a famous four-piece mural depicting biological warfare, death and destruction, the surrender of all national sovereignty, and the emergence of a new religion.
[00:47:54.366 --> 00:48:07.211]  On the floor, for no apparent reason, is what appears to be the symbol for gold and silver in a mining cart, AUAG, which is also the abbreviation for a deadly strain of hepatitis discovered in 1965.
[00:48:09.352 --> 00:48:26.372]  Outside on the surface, the runways form the shape of a swastika, and passengers are greeted by what has become known as Blucifer, a 32-foot horse with glowing red eyes that reportedly killed its creator when a piece of the sculpture came loose and severed an artery in his leg.
[00:48:27.213 --> 00:48:40.564]  This is why many people are talking about Denver's Bug Out Bag program, which is good, because now that we know who the people committing these historic crimes against humanity are, we can't just let them slip away into some hole somewhere.
[00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:43.707]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:48:45.568 --> 00:48:54.756]  Alright folks, it's Monday, we're live, September 26th.
[00:48:56.181 --> 00:49:00.242]  Find that report, Bug Out Bags, Underground Bases, at the Denver International Airport at band.video.
[00:49:00.322 --> 00:49:02.723]  We're going to go to break.
[00:49:02.763 --> 00:49:04.904]  Come right back with all the latest news and information.
[00:49:05.324 --> 00:49:05.944]  And your phone calls.
[00:49:05.964 --> 00:49:06.445]  Please stay with us.
[00:49:10.906 --> 00:49:16.208]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:49:16.308 --> 00:49:24.231]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:49:25.774 --> 00:49:29.516]  So the planet's food supply at every level is being purposely turned off.
[00:49:31.217 --> 00:49:34.138]  The planet's energy supply is being purposely turned off.
[00:49:35.619 --> 00:49:38.220]  The third world was under two years plus of lockdown.
[00:49:39.861 --> 00:49:45.383]  And now the very globalists that engineered this are posing as our saviors while they carry it out.
[00:49:46.724 --> 00:49:54.868]  And why are they coming out in the open so much and promoting world government, promoting communism, promoting putting microchips in us to buy and sell, promoting pedophilia?
[00:49:56.328 --> 00:49:59.009]  Because they're evil, and this is what they want, and they're a cult.
[00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:02.591]  And they got a bunch of followers that'll do what they're told for power.
[00:50:03.992 --> 00:50:04.972]  So they're going for broke.
[00:50:08.294 --> 00:50:08.994]  I'm gonna get to that.
[00:50:09.094 --> 00:50:19.979]  Spain's Minister of Equality, Irene Montero, says children's have the right to consent to sexual relations with adults, including five-year-olds.
[00:50:23.507 --> 00:50:24.948]  This is on national television.
[00:50:24.968 --> 00:50:26.949]  The government, head of an agency.
[00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:28.450]  This is who they are.
[00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:30.052]  It's a Nambla army.
[00:50:30.712 --> 00:50:32.013]  It's a pedophile army.
[00:50:32.493 --> 00:50:33.674]  I warned you about for decades.
[00:50:33.754 --> 00:50:36.296]  It's what they want is the future and innocence.
[00:50:36.536 --> 00:50:38.217]  They want to destroy the human soul.
[00:50:39.778 --> 00:50:42.020]  Just like in the archetype of a zombie, they want brains.
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:43.601]  Because they don't have brains.
[00:50:44.582 --> 00:50:45.822]  They have an envy of life.
[00:50:46.963 --> 00:50:47.944]  An envy of innocence.
[00:50:48.604 --> 00:50:49.465]  They want to destroy it.
[00:50:51.212 --> 00:50:55.075]  Well, let's talk about the evil raggedy Ann, the former White House press secretary, Jen Psaki.
[00:50:56.276 --> 00:51:03.242]  On upcoming midterm elections, former top Biden spokesperson says, if it's a referendum on the president, Democrats will lose.
[00:51:03.282 --> 00:51:03.762]  Here's the clip.
[00:51:04.963 --> 00:51:07.825]  If it is a referendum on the president, they will lose.
[00:51:07.925 --> 00:51:08.526]  And they know that.
[00:51:08.786 --> 00:51:11.669]  They also know that crime is a huge vulnerability for Democrats.
[00:51:11.729 --> 00:51:13.690]  I would say one of the biggest vulnerabilities.
[00:51:15.472 --> 00:51:18.034]  Now, if Biden was actually president, she'd be scared to say that.
[00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:19.595]  She knows Obama is the president.
[00:51:23.635 --> 00:51:24.756]  So the arrogance of this.
[00:51:27.858 --> 00:51:28.618]  Let's play this clip.
[00:51:28.678 --> 00:51:31.460]  White House advisor, Keisha Bottoms.
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:33.481]  Biden's been very clear.
[00:51:33.821 --> 00:51:37.583]  My Republican plan is to essentially destroy the United States of America.
[00:51:38.604 --> 00:51:41.086]  Trump tried to empower America.
[00:51:41.126 --> 00:51:42.386]  Say what you want about the poison shots.
[00:51:42.426 --> 00:51:43.507]  Everything else he did was really good.
[00:51:43.827 --> 00:51:47.229]  He tried to bring jobs back, secure the border, lower crime.
[00:51:47.249 --> 00:51:47.609]  He did.
[00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:49.931]  Made us the number one energy exporter in the world.
[00:51:51.326 --> 00:51:55.510]  Everything they say about us is what they themselves are doing.
[00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:55.931]  Here she is.
[00:51:56.630 --> 00:52:07.234]  This election is a very important election, not just for Democrats, but also for Republicans, also for Independents, and anyone who cares about the United States of America.
[00:52:07.694 --> 00:52:19.439]  There is a MAGA Republican agenda that gives no consideration to the rule of law, that has no respect for a woman's right to choose, that wants to defund the FBI.
[00:52:19.859 --> 00:52:29.380]   There is a MAGA Republican agenda that thought that it was okay to attack our nation's capital on January 6th. I think people will
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:35.561]   think of all of these things when they go to the ballot box, no matter what their party
[00:52:35.561 --> 00:52:42.041]   affiliation is, and I think that they will vote accordingly. You know, I've noticed, and I think a lot
[00:52:42.041 --> 00:52:47.381]   of people have noticed, a certain phrase that you have been using since the very first answer,
[00:52:47.381 --> 00:52:51.620]   and that's MAGA Republicans, or MAGA Republican agenda.
[00:52:51.784 --> 00:53:00.789]  It is a tough line being taken by the President and by you here right now against Republicans writ large.
[00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:13.417]  My question is, will the President and will folks in the administration between now and the November 8th elections keep hammering away at that phrase, at that imagery?
[00:53:15.267 --> 00:53:22.073]  Well I think it will be important for all of us who care about the United States of America to call out what we see.
[00:53:22.493 --> 00:53:28.938]  And what we see again with this MAGA Republican agenda is an effort to disrupt our democracy.
[00:53:29.018 --> 00:53:40.628]  So whether it be through November and beyond November, I think it will always be important to call out any effort there is to destroy, essentially destroy the United States of America.
[00:53:40.688 --> 00:53:42.449]  President Biden has been very clear.
[00:53:42.529 --> 00:53:43.629]  I can't listen to any more of it.
[00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:46.470]  So, so, everything she said was a lie.
[00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:47.930]  Except the abortion thing.
[00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:49.311]  We're talking about the lives of children.
[00:53:50.511 --> 00:53:52.032]  The Republicans want to destroy the country.
[00:53:52.692 --> 00:53:54.272]  The Republicans wanted to attack the Capitol.
[00:53:54.552 --> 00:53:57.093]  New footage of Ray Epps with the sign ramming the police.
[00:53:57.453 --> 00:53:58.053]  Feds know that.
[00:53:58.933 --> 00:54:04.015]  Anybody that rammed police is a sedition conspiracy charge in solitary confinement, but not him.
[00:54:04.775 --> 00:54:05.915]  Look at the job we're putting on screen.
[00:54:07.756 --> 00:54:12.869]   So, Owen Schroer was there trying to stop people going in with me.
[00:54:13.169 --> 00:54:14.070]  They indicted him.
[00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:18.011]  Our cameraman, Sam Montoya, just shot video of it.
[00:54:19.511 --> 00:54:19.871]  Indicted.
[00:54:22.172 --> 00:54:30.135]  But if you're actually ramming police with a giant metal barricade, hey baby, you're good, and Raskin and the rest of the committee members come out and defend him.
[00:54:33.076 --> 00:54:33.816]  They think you're stupid.
[00:54:36.482 --> 00:54:37.084]  Total lies.
[00:54:37.426 --> 00:54:39.694]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's turning up the heat.
[00:54:40.938 --> 00:54:41.400]  Hitler-y!
[00:54:42.525 --> 00:54:48.965]   has now compared minor rallies to Hitler, claiming people waving their hands are Hitler.
[00:54:48.965 --> 00:54:53.804]   Just like Democrats the last few weeks said, Christians putting their hands up to God
[00:54:53.804 --> 00:54:56.565]  in part of worship and praise is Hitler.
[00:54:56.565 --> 00:54:58.463]  They call it the double Hitler salute.
[00:54:58.463 --> 00:55:03.525]   These people are ridiculous, but their constituents, folks, are mindless.
[00:55:03.525 --> 00:55:04.764]  They actually believe it.
[00:55:04.764 --> 00:55:07.724]  So they're defining the American people as Nazis.
[00:55:07.724 --> 00:55:10.564]  Here she is.
[00:55:10.564 --> 00:55:20.025]   I remember as a young student, you know, trying to figure out how did people get basically
[00:55:20.025 --> 00:55:21.224]  drawn in by Hitler?
[00:55:21.271 --> 00:55:22.092]  How did that happen?
[00:55:22.332 --> 00:55:30.575]  And I'd watch newsreels and I'd see this guy standing up there ranting and raving and people shouting and raising their arms.
[00:55:30.635 --> 00:55:32.455]  I thought, what's happened to these people?
[00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:33.556]  Why did they believe that?
[00:55:34.116 --> 00:55:36.417]  You saw the rally in Ohio the other night.
[00:55:36.938 --> 00:55:45.982]  Trump is there ranting and raving for more than an hour, and you have these rows of young men with their arms raised.
[00:55:46.342 --> 00:55:48.364]  I thought, what is going on?
[00:55:48.864 --> 00:55:57.868]  So there is a real pressure, and I think it is fair to say we're in a struggle between democracy and autocracy.
[00:55:57.888 --> 00:56:02.351]  So if you go to a football game and raise your hand or wave or church, you're a Nazi.
[00:56:03.851 --> 00:56:05.131]  These people are desperate.
[00:56:05.712 --> 00:56:16.735]  And again, the videos on InfoWars.com of RAAFs helping ram the giant metal barricade into, or the giant metal skeleton of a Trump sign, into the police.
[00:56:17.815 --> 00:56:21.817]  FBI whistleblower reveals widespread discussions at the Bureau in bombshell Bongino interview.
[00:56:22.617 --> 00:56:26.478]  More of these whistleblowers coming public that they're ordered to target political enemies and frame them.
[00:56:27.811 --> 00:56:34.315]  Nasty rep Jamie Raskin on January 6th when he claims he doesn't know who Ray Epps is after standing up for Ray Epps earlier.
[00:56:36.216 --> 00:56:40.178]  And the Oath Keepers are forced to go to trial this week on bogus seditious conspiracy charges.
[00:56:41.579 --> 00:56:47.402]  While the government denies the discovery, arrests the key witnesses, and jury bias plagues the kangaroo court process.
[00:56:47.682 --> 00:56:50.521]  total authoritarian lawlessness.
[00:56:50.521 --> 00:56:56.842]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[00:56:56.842 --> 00:57:06.842]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:56:58.516 --> 00:56:59.998]  I just gave out the toll-free number, 877-789-2539.
[00:57:00.118 --> 00:57:15.314]  We're going to go to Joel, and Fatima, and Noah, and Charlene, and Gary, and Ventura, and Diego, Andrew, Bill, Jeremiah, Jared, and others.

[00:57:25.192 --> 00:57:26.673]  When you don't, the enemy wins.
[00:57:27.153 --> 00:57:28.354]  So thank you all for tuning in.
[00:57:28.414 --> 00:57:31.615]  You are the most hated people on Earth by the globalist pedophile armies.

[00:57:35.757 --> 00:57:36.937]  This is an exciting time.
[00:57:37.497 --> 00:57:43.040]  But you are seen by the enemy as the most dangerous people on Earth towards their tyranny, because you are.
[00:57:43.340 --> 00:58:00.353]   So please spread the word, please pray for the broadcast, and please, Go to InfoWarsTore.com and get the trifecta pack of DNA Force Plus and the high quality vitamin C with zinc and the vitamin D3 gummies with the calcium, all of it.

[00:59:08.071 --> 00:59:15.071]  [Music]
[00:59:15.071 --> 00:59:22.071]  [Music]
[00:59:22.071 --> 00:59:25.071]  [Music]
[00:59:24.699 --> 00:59:25.460]  To the place.
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:34.460]   Older than the trees, younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze.
[00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:46.460]  Country roads take me home to the place I belong.
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:52.460]  West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home.
[00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:56.460]  Take me home.
[00:59:56.460 --> 01:00:00.460]  Take me home.
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.460]  Take me home.
[01:00:02.003 --> 01:00:02.663]  It's their religion.
[01:00:03.424 --> 01:00:04.404]  We gotta come to grips with it.
[01:00:04.424 --> 01:00:05.124]  We gotta face it.
[01:00:06.284 --> 01:00:11.225]  And I also have news that is very positive, but it's also horrific to know.
[01:00:13.105 --> 01:00:25.594]   Every day, more top scientists, including FDA board members, European board members of their FDA, Go public and say these shots don't work and they're killing people in mass.
[01:00:26.034 --> 01:00:29.174]  I have a stack of new scientists coming out now and new studies.
[01:00:31.715 --> 01:00:32.795]  But let that sink in.
[01:00:34.515 --> 01:00:37.936]  That we knew this was going on two and a half years ago because we knew the enemy operation.
[01:00:38.436 --> 01:00:39.416]  And they knew because they did it.
[01:00:40.276 --> 01:00:41.256]  And now it's confirmed.
[01:00:41.316 --> 01:00:46.377]  And just let that roll over you that that's how evil these people are.
[01:00:46.397 --> 01:00:47.777]  You're like, why do they want to rape children?
[01:00:47.817 --> 01:00:48.958]  Why do they want to destroy their innocence?
[01:00:49.338 --> 01:00:50.338]  Why do they want to ruin their lives?
[01:00:51.803 --> 01:00:53.324]  That's the next best thing to killing them.
[01:00:55.446 --> 01:00:57.568]  You've got to come to grips, and I'm telling myself that.
[01:00:58.109 --> 01:00:58.629]  Not just you.
[01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:02.453]  That we're dealing with absolute, pure evil.
[01:01:05.956 --> 01:01:09.720]  What fool would want to sign on and be part of this evil?
[01:01:10.901 --> 01:01:11.922]  Only people that play along.
[01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:16.751]  And pretend they're part of the establishment, that they're going to get ahead by being part of this.
[01:01:16.831 --> 01:01:17.031]  No.
[01:01:17.652 --> 01:01:19.472]  You'll destroy yourself and us along with you.
[01:01:20.073 --> 01:01:24.114]  Joel in Idaho wants to talk about Russia conflict and the NWO.
[01:01:24.154 --> 01:01:24.675]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:01:26.335 --> 01:01:26.795]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:26.996 --> 01:01:27.876]  Long time listener.
[01:01:27.896 --> 01:01:29.957]  I've been listening to you since Fukushima.
[01:01:30.337 --> 01:01:31.918]  Really glad to be on here with you today.
[01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:37.240]  So, I've just got a few things to say about the whole Russia situation.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.601]  The left wants war with Russia.
[01:01:40.301 --> 01:01:42.362]  If they could, they'd kill every single last Russian.
[01:01:43.174 --> 01:01:54.683]  So, I think the only way we're going to be able to make our voice heard is by having mass protests in every capital city in the United States, and across the world, in Brazil, in Germany, France, and Italy.
[01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:55.724]  I totally agree.
[01:01:55.764 --> 01:01:57.966]  We're on the verge of nuclear war, even the Pentagon admits that.
[01:01:58.286 --> 01:01:59.667]  This crap needs to stop now.
[01:02:00.068 --> 01:02:01.529]  Over a Slavic civil war?
[01:02:01.629 --> 01:02:02.109]  No, sir.
[01:02:02.129 --> 01:02:03.450]  Needs to stop right now.
[01:02:04.511 --> 01:02:04.932]  I agree.
[01:02:04.952 --> 01:02:06.072]  It's completely ludicrous.
[01:02:06.933 --> 01:02:14.193]   And, you know, the people in the Pentagon are absolute psychopaths, the ones who are in charge of this kind of stuff, and they want Use their nukes.
[01:02:14.253 --> 01:02:15.753]  So, it's a match made in hell.
[01:02:15.773 --> 01:02:25.115]  So, I mean, if we had 10,000 conservatives in every city, 500,000 people across the state, I think that wouldn't make our voices heard.
[01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:26.815]  I don't know what happened after that.
[01:02:26.915 --> 01:02:40.238]  Oh, there's no doubt that if 500,000 people went to demonstrations in front of government facilities, in front of media outlets, and at military bases, peacefully, saying, we don't want war, the troops don't want war, we don't want nuclear war, that would send a message, we need to do that.
[01:02:41.383 --> 01:02:41.623]  Right.
[01:02:42.004 --> 01:02:43.145]  And it has to be peaceful.
[01:02:43.225 --> 01:02:48.429]  And if, you know, the government provocateurs get there and they start messing stuff up, we have to detain them.
[01:02:48.449 --> 01:02:51.652]  We have to police ourselves so they don't do it for us.
[01:02:51.692 --> 01:02:59.779]  What do you make of this new footage that shows Raab's hands on the giant steel sign, ramming it into the police?
[01:03:00.868 --> 01:03:07.252]  I mean, we have him dead to rights, and Raskin, the head of the committee, has defended him, said he's a great guy, has interviewed him.
[01:03:07.632 --> 01:03:09.553]  Now, Raskin says he doesn't know who he is.
[01:03:10.274 --> 01:03:13.095]  Total perjury by that criminal from Marilyn Raskin.
[01:03:14.296 --> 01:03:16.317]  Yes, they are all criminals in Congress.
[01:03:16.857 --> 01:03:23.001]  And Raskin is compromised, and he's a tool being used by the FBI against all of us.
[01:03:23.061 --> 01:03:24.422]  And he was really good at what he did.
[01:03:24.442 --> 01:03:28.384]  So, I think if we keep the heat on him, eventually he'll pop.
[01:03:29.355 --> 01:03:30.976]  And we can unravel the J6.
[01:03:31.136 --> 01:03:32.837]  I think he is the linchpin of this whole thing.
[01:03:34.358 --> 01:03:45.546]  But I was going to say, we can get somebody like Ron DeSantis or Trump, or maybe both of them, other conservative leaders, to come out and say, hey, get 10,000 conservatives in each city.
[01:03:46.386 --> 01:03:47.467]  Don't burn anything down.
[01:03:47.547 --> 01:03:48.227]  Don't invade.
[01:03:48.247 --> 01:03:49.989]  Don't do anything crazy or stupid.
[01:03:50.009 --> 01:03:51.109]  Have a sign.
[01:03:51.149 --> 01:03:51.970]  Have a candlelight.
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:53.781]  You know, pray for humanity.
[01:03:53.841 --> 01:03:54.341]  No, no, I agree.
[01:03:54.361 --> 01:04:00.804]  I've been calling for candlelight vigils and I'm not saying we caused it, but there's suddenly candlelight vigils are happening in the U.S., Europe, you name it, against war.
[01:04:01.904 --> 01:04:03.225]  Yes, I was listening to you yesterday.
[01:04:03.245 --> 01:04:04.165]  I think that's a great idea.
[01:04:04.665 --> 01:04:07.086]  But beyond that, I just had a few other things I wanted to go across.
[01:04:07.126 --> 01:04:07.407]  You know what?
[01:04:07.427 --> 01:04:08.167]  I'm going to step up.
[01:04:08.227 --> 01:04:08.927]  I'm going to step up.
[01:04:09.587 --> 01:04:17.311]  Sometime this week, I'll pick a day, we should go to the Texas Capitol and have a candlelight vigil.
[01:04:17.331 --> 01:04:19.392]  That's a great idea.
[01:04:20.392 --> 01:04:21.713]  I actually lived in Austin.
[01:04:22.568 --> 01:04:28.092]  A couple years ago, I moved down there in part because of you, but man, that place has turned into a hellhole.
[01:04:28.412 --> 01:04:29.213]  Oh brother, it is.
[01:04:29.293 --> 01:04:29.953]  It is horrible.
[01:04:30.354 --> 01:04:33.296]  I mean, only in the central area is it left.
[01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:36.058]  It's run, but it's like a little piece of San Francisco landed here.
[01:04:36.098 --> 01:04:36.598]  Thank you, Joel.
[01:04:37.319 --> 01:04:38.479]  Alright, let's go ahead and take more calls.
[01:04:38.519 --> 01:04:40.541]  Let's talk to Jared in Texas, speaking of Texas.
[01:04:40.921 --> 01:04:41.662]  Jared, thanks for calling.
[01:04:42.662 --> 01:04:44.003]  Wow, thank you so much, Alex.
[01:04:44.063 --> 01:04:45.044]  Thank you for the work you're doing.
[01:04:45.084 --> 01:04:45.725]  God bless you.
[01:04:45.945 --> 01:04:46.185]  Thank you.
[01:04:47.406 --> 01:04:50.430]  Yeah, I just wanted to plug NovusOrdoWatch.org.
[01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:51.291]  You gotta check it out.
[01:04:51.411 --> 01:04:59.882]  Unmasking the Modernist, Vatican II, pedophiles, the fake Catholics, anti-popes, the real churches underground again.
[01:04:59.942 --> 01:05:00.763]  So go check it out.
[01:05:03.177 --> 01:05:03.337]  Yeah.
[01:05:03.557 --> 01:05:09.360]  Well, that's the thing, you know, real Catholics, I'm not Catholic myself, I'm just a Christian, but I know a lot of Catholics that I would say are followers of Christ.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.161]  The hardest fighting people I know are the underground church.
[01:05:12.602 --> 01:05:13.822]  People like Mel Gibson and others.
[01:05:13.882 --> 01:05:15.203]  I know his dad and I know him.
[01:05:15.983 --> 01:05:19.505]  But, you know, they're the best people.
[01:05:19.965 --> 01:05:26.609]  And, you know, that's why we saw the left attack Catholic schools, the rest of it, because they know that that is a huge growing movement.
[01:05:26.909 --> 01:05:28.770]  And this current Pope is 100% New World Order.
[01:05:30.545 --> 01:05:31.908]  They're afraid of the rosary, Alex.
[01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:33.149]  They're afraid of the rosary.
[01:05:33.810 --> 01:05:34.592]  And St.
[01:05:34.772 --> 01:05:38.217]  Athanasius back in, I don't know, the 300s or something.
[01:05:38.718 --> 01:05:40.481]  They have the buildings, but we have the faith.
[01:05:40.961 --> 01:05:43.145]  So that's all I have, and thank you so much for all you're doing.
[01:05:43.743 --> 01:05:44.323]  Absolutely.
[01:05:44.944 --> 01:05:53.447]  You know, I don't believe in idols, and I'm not saying the rosary is an idol, but it's not an idol in your church to have a cross, or an image of Christ to focus your mind.
[01:05:53.968 --> 01:06:00.470]  And if you have a rosary or whatever, and you're praying to God, and other people are doing it, and you have the Holy Spirit, it's a focal point.
[01:06:01.011 --> 01:06:02.171]  Like putting your arms forward.
[01:06:02.211 --> 01:06:13.316]  They cannot stand that, because God's a free will God, and if you reach out, I can tell you, when I pray privately, I mean, I'll either get on my knees, put my head on the ground, or I just reach out, and that just opens the channel.
[01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:17.290]  And it's beyond what you call meditation, and it literally opens the gate.
[01:06:17.951 --> 01:06:18.871]  And they're scared of that.
[01:06:20.032 --> 01:06:27.335]  And they're scared of people getting on their knees, or they're scared of people focusing on God, and they just can't stand it.
[01:06:27.795 --> 01:06:41.322]  They just absolutely can't stand it, because you have that crucifix in your hand, and you're holding it, and it's that loop, that symbol of eternity, and you're holding that chain in your hand, and you're just, it gives a focal point.
[01:06:42.559 --> 01:07:02.544]  They don't like crucifix, they don't like rosaries, they don't like crosses, they don't like getting on your knees, they don't like reaching your hands out, because it's the ritual of, I'm here God, I want to find you, and you're holding that crucifix, God I want you, I love you, I need you, please help us, please help us, please, please, please!
[01:07:02.564 --> 01:07:03.764]  That's what God wants.
[01:07:04.878 --> 01:07:10.404]  God wants us to repent and seek his face like King David in the place of the most high, the quiet place of the most high.
[01:07:10.424 --> 01:07:12.325]  And we've got to go to that place.
[01:07:13.647 --> 01:07:17.471]  So however you do it, you need to do it, folks, because we're on the verge of nuclear war.
[01:07:17.731 --> 01:07:18.972]  We're already in financial collapse.
[01:07:20.474 --> 01:07:22.375]  And it's just incredible.
[01:07:22.456 --> 01:07:22.696]  All right.
[01:07:24.057 --> 01:07:26.379]  I'm going to go to break.
[01:07:26.399 --> 01:07:27.260]  I got two calls that segment.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:27.721]  That's not enough.
[01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:31.296]  No matter how good your calls are, I'm going to give each person two minutes.
[01:07:31.316 --> 01:07:33.076]  So I'm going to take your calls.
[01:07:33.096 --> 01:07:34.257]  We're going to go to break.
[01:07:34.277 --> 01:07:36.397]  I'm going to come back and take your calls.
[01:07:36.938 --> 01:07:40.079]  And again, I hate to plug every segment, but if we don't, we're not going to be here soon.
[01:07:40.119 --> 01:07:42.319]  We are on the verge of collapse, like everything else.
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:44.100]  So please financially support InfoWars.
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:52.883]  Go to infowarsstore.com and get a copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, either unsigned, regular price, or the promotional prices of fundraising.
[01:07:54.221 --> 01:07:59.389]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:01.472]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:08:02.113 --> 01:08:03.315]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:04.076 --> 01:08:09.076]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:09.076 --> 01:08:15.076]  [MUSIC]
[01:08:15.076 --> 01:08:18.076]  We are taking your calls and the order they're received.
[01:08:18.081 --> 01:08:20.262]  Callers bring up really interesting, informative points.
[01:08:20.822 --> 01:08:21.603]  I thank you for calling.
[01:08:21.643 --> 01:08:24.004]  Charlene from Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:08:24.044 --> 01:08:24.404]  Welcome.
[01:08:25.105 --> 01:08:25.585]  Hello.
[01:08:25.645 --> 01:08:26.225]  Hi, Alex.
[01:08:26.365 --> 01:08:28.066]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:08:28.126 --> 01:08:29.747]  Thank you.
[01:08:29.807 --> 01:08:32.809]  God bless you for the work that you're doing for God's kingdom.
[01:08:32.869 --> 01:08:34.910]  I think we're living in Sodom and Gomorrah.
[01:08:35.670 --> 01:08:59.867]   Okay, my question is, why can't Dr. Merlone, who created The mRNA vaccine, the technology, which was originally created to go in and attack cancer cells, why can't he take that same technology and use it again to go after the spike protein and the lipid nanoparticles that they're injecting into us with the COVID vaccine?
[01:08:59.887 --> 01:09:03.748]  Well, absolutely.
[01:09:03.908 --> 01:09:05.549]  mRNA technology can be used for good.
[01:09:05.569 --> 01:09:06.509]  They've used it for evil.
[01:09:07.622 --> 01:09:16.171]  But again, it's so experimental in almost every case they've tested it, it causes a high percentage of side effects, including fatalities.
[01:09:16.211 --> 01:09:18.253]  So I don't think there's any perfect fix for this.
[01:09:19.594 --> 01:09:20.154]  None at all?
[01:09:21.376 --> 01:09:30.604]  Well, I'm not a genetic engineer, microbiologist, virologist, but yeah, every time they've tried this for 20 years, they've had mRNA for 20 years.
[01:09:32.157 --> 01:09:43.925]  A decade ago, they did a test in just a very small number of people, and it would cure cancer 97% of the time, but the rest of the time it would dissolve the liver.
[01:09:45.146 --> 01:09:47.288]  So it's Russian roulette.
[01:09:47.328 --> 01:09:49.549]  The problem is it doesn't work.
[01:09:50.190 --> 01:09:54.493]  And so it works sometimes, but a lot of the time it kills you.
[01:09:56.618 --> 01:09:57.639]  Thank you for the answer.
[01:09:57.739 --> 01:10:01.300]  I think right now everybody's so evil out there.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.241]  I'm afraid to go outside of my house.
[01:10:03.322 --> 01:10:09.425]  These people, I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and these people are like raging lunatics.
[01:10:09.485 --> 01:10:11.626]  You're standing in a line and they're yelling at you.
[01:10:12.826 --> 01:10:15.588]  And so I hope it's not as bad down there in Texas.
[01:10:16.937 --> 01:10:18.518]  Well, no, the economy is in deep trouble.
[01:10:18.538 --> 01:10:21.601]  They're not telling us we're really in a depression, but all the numbers show that.
[01:10:21.641 --> 01:10:22.722]  God bless you, Charlene.
[01:10:22.742 --> 01:10:25.784]  Just find a good family group, find a good church, stick together.
[01:10:25.804 --> 01:10:27.005]  We're going to make it through this.
[01:10:27.025 --> 01:10:29.107]  But yeah, I know the temperature's been raised a lot.
[01:10:29.147 --> 01:10:29.527]  Thank you.
[01:10:30.028 --> 01:10:31.188]  Let's go to Gary in Florida.
[01:10:31.229 --> 01:10:31.849]  Gary, go ahead.
[01:10:33.891 --> 01:10:35.232]  Alex, God bless you.
[01:10:35.492 --> 01:10:37.113]  I would just make a suggestion.
[01:10:37.173 --> 01:10:50.868]   When you're at one of your next court, the impromptu press conferences that you're having, I just think it would be so powerful for you to just speak About all the damages that the vaccines are doing to children, the myocarditis, the heart attacks.
[01:10:50.948 --> 01:10:56.654]  Like, any question that they ask you, just answer with powerful facts about what harm is being done to children.
[01:10:57.935 --> 01:10:58.275]  I agree.
[01:10:58.295 --> 01:11:05.502]  Everybody should be going to city council meetings, school board meetings, where they tried to force this, but it failed everywhere, including now in New York, it's failing.
[01:11:05.962 --> 01:11:11.947]  But notice they tried to Buffalo outside of law and intimidate as many children in places like Portland, D.C.
[01:11:13.391 --> 01:11:22.116]  New York, you name it, Chicago, to make the kids take it, and now they're having to pull back because they know they're in deep trouble and it's coming out, it's killing people.
[01:11:22.436 --> 01:11:26.138]  Well, they knew the whole time, not the people pushing at the ground level, but those above it.
[01:11:26.498 --> 01:11:27.319]  And so you're absolutely right.
[01:11:27.439 --> 01:11:31.981]  Everywhere we can now, we have to point out that we're vindicated, it's true, it was all a fraud.
[01:11:33.482 --> 01:11:36.224]  Yeah, 10-year-olds do not have heart attacks.
[01:11:36.644 --> 01:11:37.284]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:11:37.324 --> 01:11:37.605]  Thank you.
[01:11:38.105 --> 01:11:38.585]  God bless you.
[01:11:38.605 --> 01:11:39.646]  And you know, he raises that.
[01:11:40.512 --> 01:11:43.473]  At the start of the next segment, I'm going to hit the newest news on that front.
[01:11:43.573 --> 01:11:44.333]  It's unbelievable.
[01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:46.094]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:11:46.134 --> 01:11:47.514]  Let's talk to Noah in Oklahoma.
[01:11:47.554 --> 01:11:48.114]  Noah, go ahead.
[01:11:49.315 --> 01:11:50.335]  Hey, it's Noah.
[01:11:50.555 --> 01:11:52.016]  I'm 15 years old.
[01:11:52.276 --> 01:11:53.096]  I live in Oklahoma.
[01:11:53.276 --> 01:11:56.517]  And I just want to say it's an honor to talk with you.
[01:11:56.757 --> 01:11:57.638]  Honor to talk to you, sir.
[01:11:57.658 --> 01:11:57.938]  Go ahead.
[01:11:57.958 --> 01:12:04.460]  Yeah, just, you know, in these end times, you really got to stand together with your family.
[01:12:05.825 --> 01:12:07.806]  Nations were never built on one person.
[01:12:08.066 --> 01:12:10.187]  You can't go out there and live on your own in these end times.
[01:12:10.227 --> 01:12:11.188]  You need a community.
[01:12:11.208 --> 01:12:16.070]  And that's what it's going to take to survive in these end times, and we also need Jesus.
[01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:18.051]  These are our only hope.
[01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:21.913]  We can't trust on how much guns we have, how much food we have.
[01:12:22.814 --> 01:12:24.314]  You know, we can't trust on any of that.
[01:12:24.354 --> 01:12:27.756]  It's really, we gotta trust on God, and that's the only thing we can do.
[01:12:27.776 --> 01:12:38.663]   And community, and that's why God made the church to stand together, because he knew that Men are weak by themselves, but whenever they're together, they are strong.
[01:12:39.583 --> 01:12:42.085]  It's armies that take down countries, not one man.
[01:12:43.725 --> 01:12:53.770]  So, yeah, I just wanted to say that, and just keep a good fight, and just keep doing the Lord's work for us.
[01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.710]  Well, I'm trying.
[01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:55.771]  I don't plan to be a saint here.
[01:12:55.831 --> 01:12:59.372]  I just don't like pedophilia and Satanism and world government nuclear war.
[01:13:00.353 --> 01:13:01.633]  Is your family awake, Noah?
[01:13:01.753 --> 01:13:02.934]  And how did you find the show?
[01:13:04.258 --> 01:13:11.285]  So my dad has been listening for a long time and I've been listening with him as long as I can, as remembered.
[01:13:12.406 --> 01:13:16.871]  And yeah, I think my uncle started listening first and then my dad caught on.
[01:13:17.111 --> 01:13:21.896]  And then, yeah, we're all awake and just sticking in there and waiting for it to happen.
[01:13:22.622 --> 01:13:30.447]  Well, it's not like you needed me to tell you what was going on, but we have been one of the most successful shows exposing the New World Order.
[01:13:31.027 --> 01:13:37.751]  Now, though, anybody that ever criticized you or attacked your dad or your uncle, they look like fools now, because it's all here now.
[01:13:39.232 --> 01:13:44.996]  Yeah, I mean, like, three years ago, me and my brother, we'd go, hey, you know, stuff's happening.
[01:13:45.256 --> 01:13:46.096]  Stuff's gonna go down.
[01:13:46.137 --> 01:13:47.838]  And they'd go, ha ha ha, you're so funny.
[01:13:47.858 --> 01:13:50.239]  And then we're like, we'd like to go back to those churches.
[01:13:50.279 --> 01:13:53.429]   We said that because we'd be like, What are you saying now?
[01:13:53.789 --> 01:13:55.290]  Because it is going down like we said.
[01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:57.550]  You know, we're not stupid.
[01:13:57.710 --> 01:14:04.792]  And then I have a job and I'm telling the guys at work, it's like, hey, it's stuff going down and it's not going to get any better.
[01:14:04.812 --> 01:14:07.352]  And they're going, what are you talking about?
[01:14:07.572 --> 01:14:09.053]  People are really blind to it.
[01:14:09.173 --> 01:14:18.495]  And, you know, it's just the deception of Satan has put, I mean, the Bible says that Satan has put a coded, like a deception over their eyes.
[01:14:19.275 --> 01:14:23.481]  Well, when people turn their back on God, the Bible tells us that they're given over to great delusion.
[01:14:24.002 --> 01:14:25.084]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:14:25.124 --> 01:14:26.225]  Thank you so much, Noah.
[01:14:27.667 --> 01:14:31.173]  Now this caller, Bill in New York, makes me think of Dr. Zelenko.
[01:14:32.150 --> 01:14:43.275]  And I was already thinking about Dr. Zelenko that died a few months ago, and how quickly we forget what a beautiful soul he was, and how much courage he had, and how he was one of the first doctors to go public and save millions of lives with the things he discovered.
[01:14:44.155 --> 01:14:44.955]  And he wasn't bluffing.
[01:14:44.975 --> 01:14:47.116]  He told me, he goes, look, I got heart failure and cancer.
[01:14:47.136 --> 01:14:48.577]  I'll probably be dead soon, but I love you, Alex.
[01:14:48.597 --> 01:14:50.098]  Last time I talked to him on the phone.
[01:14:50.538 --> 01:14:51.578]  I appreciate you keep it up.
[01:14:52.639 --> 01:14:55.040]  And he basically, by the end, was a follower of Christ.
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:15:00.026]  He said, we won't know what the next Messiah looks like, just like we didn't know Jesus when he came.
[01:15:00.226 --> 01:15:02.189]  And, but, you know, he was obviously the Messiah.
[01:15:02.549 --> 01:15:03.691]  He said that on air, too.
[01:15:03.731 --> 01:15:05.653]  He said, you know, he said, I love Christians.
[01:15:05.714 --> 01:15:06.815]  I believe Christians are right.
[01:15:07.496 --> 01:15:09.699]  And I believe, you know, we're all together, folks.
[01:15:09.859 --> 01:15:11.441]  And he was a beautiful soul.
[01:15:11.461 --> 01:15:16.323]   And he always talked about People just can't deal with this.
[01:15:16.404 --> 01:15:17.064]  It's too horrible.
[01:15:17.584 --> 01:15:18.924]  It's too overwhelming.
[01:15:19.385 --> 01:15:23.406]  That's why only the Holy Spirit can give you the discernment to understand it, because you don't want to rape children.
[01:15:23.446 --> 01:15:24.387]  You don't want nuclear war.
[01:15:24.667 --> 01:15:25.787]  You're not in the New World Order.
[01:15:25.807 --> 01:15:27.008]  You're not in their satanic club.
[01:15:27.668 --> 01:15:31.669]  So I was just thinking about Zelenko today, and then this caller brings up a point he always made.
[01:15:31.969 --> 01:15:32.930]  Bill in New York, go ahead.
[01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:46.448]   Hey, that was a good segue right into that, because that's exactly what I've been trying Deal with lately is exactly that point.
[01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:49.110]  Are you there?
[01:15:49.890 --> 01:15:50.271]  I am, sir.
[01:15:51.111 --> 01:15:51.952]  Okay, sorry.
[01:15:52.152 --> 01:15:53.212]  I didn't hear anything at first.
[01:15:53.833 --> 01:15:58.555]  So when you first brought Zelenko on, I was super inspired.
[01:15:58.615 --> 01:16:00.637]  I actually live not too far from Rochester.
[01:16:00.657 --> 01:16:02.518]  I'm over in north of Syracuse.
[01:16:03.818 --> 01:16:05.279]  It's a pretty rural area.
[01:16:05.399 --> 01:16:07.461]  You know, people think of New York, they think of the city.
[01:16:08.021 --> 01:16:09.162]  You know, I'm out in the country.
[01:16:09.182 --> 01:16:09.862]  It's farmland.
[01:16:09.922 --> 01:16:13.244]  I own my own small business, and people here are very conservative.
[01:16:14.002 --> 01:16:49.884]   And kind and, and, and, but it's very naive, you know, and, and, uh, I, I have family that's, you know, they're, they're all conservative, but when I try to talk to them about these things, they, they, it's like their eyes glaze over and they, they just don't, you know, they say, yeah, I know that's, that's, that's serious, you know, but they, they just cannot, they can't accept, you know, in my, my view is, you know, these People with genuinely good hearts, they just cannot, they cannot wrap their eyes or their heads rather around the idea of what's going on.
[01:16:49.904 --> 01:16:57.430]  And, you know, I, um, I actually tried to look up Zelenko, you know, I need a, I need a better doctor, you know, when all this COVID stuff was going on.
[01:16:57.450 --> 01:17:02.254]  And, uh, of course, you know, found out he was sick and that happened.
[01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:08.463]   you know, God rest his soul. But I was leaving my doctor's office the other day after all this,
[01:17:08.463 --> 01:17:13.264]   all this stuff with the vaccines, things are finally coming out. My doctor goes, "Hey Bill,
[01:17:13.264 --> 01:17:19.823]   when are you gonna get vaccinated?" And I, my jaw dropped to the floor. I said, "Are you kidding me?"
[01:17:19.987 --> 01:17:20.267]  Never!
[01:17:20.767 --> 01:17:24.368]  And I walked out the door and said, I need to find another doctor.
[01:17:25.248 --> 01:17:32.930]  But before you do that, take him a whole packet of info, how it's all coming out as a fraud, and hammer him with the truth so that at least he's been confronted with it.
[01:17:33.230 --> 01:17:34.251]  Thanks for the call, Bill.
[01:17:34.271 --> 01:17:35.111]  More calls straight ahead.

[01:18:00.931 --> 01:18:01.931]  [music]
[01:18:02.799 --> 01:18:10.705]  The day before Dr. Zelenko died, while emergency heart surgery, he made a six-minute statement.
[01:18:10.725 --> 01:18:14.487]  Here's three minutes of it, edited down, dealing with, this is the hill to die on.
[01:18:14.507 --> 01:18:15.568]  This is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:15.909 --> 01:18:17.109]  I want the latest vaccine news.
[01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.930]  It's so huge.
[01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:18.911]  We're going to run back to your calls.
[01:18:19.711 --> 01:18:21.873]  I just came from my doctors.
[01:18:23.409 --> 01:18:25.349]  And not good news.
[01:18:26.290 --> 01:18:33.751]  My cancer, which I've been fighting for four years, has progressed.
[01:18:35.311 --> 01:18:41.092]  There's one last ditch effort that may lead to cure, which I'm going to do.
[01:18:42.072 --> 01:18:46.773]  But if that fails, then the estimates are unpleasant.
[01:18:47.393 --> 01:18:51.114]  But I've been at this place multiple times in the last four years.
[01:18:52.498 --> 01:19:00.124]  And so when someone lives with that consciousness, something happens, like something very good happens.
[01:19:01.104 --> 01:19:06.248]  You kind of live each day and you appreciate time.
[01:19:07.329 --> 01:19:12.873]  And in reality, just think of it philosophically, you begin to die from the day you're born.
[01:19:14.914 --> 01:19:15.875]  No one lives forever.
[01:19:17.449 --> 01:19:19.911]  Some people live 20 years, some people live 100 years.
[01:19:20.371 --> 01:19:23.934]  But in the grand scheme of creation, it's finite.
[01:19:25.716 --> 01:19:29.518]  So in my opinion, it's not important when and how you die.
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:34.242]  It's much more important how you live.
[01:19:34.502 --> 01:19:39.066]  And so, because when and how you die is not in your control.
[01:19:40.527 --> 01:19:43.609]  But how you live is in your control.
[01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:50.469]   How you think, How you speak and how you act is within the free will and volition of man.
[01:19:51.689 --> 01:20:00.851]  So my advice to people is appreciate the gift of consciousness in life that you're being given.
[01:20:01.891 --> 01:20:05.932]  Happy birthday because every instant of time is an active recreation.
[01:20:06.312 --> 01:20:10.972]  It's a dynamic involvement on God's part for us to be.
[01:20:12.053 --> 01:20:17.554]   If you woke up, that's proof That he wants you to be and that you didn't finish your job.
[01:20:19.615 --> 01:20:31.961]  And I would say the world will be redeemed or fixed, rectified through acts of goodness and kindness.
[01:20:32.982 --> 01:20:37.284]  Even if the sword is on your neck, you should never give up hope.
[01:20:38.464 --> 01:20:42.146]  I do feel the sword on my neck, but I'm still very hopeful.
[01:20:43.287 --> 01:21:01.476]  And I live with more tranquility and serenity than I've ever had in my life, which is very counterintuitive, because for the carnage and the malevolence, evil that I've come into contact with in the last two years, I would not expect that type of inner peace.
[01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:12.881]   But what I've realized is that when you're in alignment, or you seem to be in alignment with the divine will, There's a certain gift of tranquility that's given.
[01:21:15.162 --> 01:21:16.523]  And it's not easy, by the way.
[01:21:16.603 --> 01:21:17.863]  It's very hard, but so what?
[01:21:18.884 --> 01:21:23.306]  And it's a constant struggle, but all the suffering that I went through, I still wouldn't give it up.
[01:21:23.886 --> 01:21:30.389]  By the way, I didn't ask for this challenge, but no one asked me, so as I went through it, I am going through it.
[01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:35.932]  The serenity is really something I've been seeking my whole life, so I'm very graceful to have it.
[01:21:38.567 --> 01:21:39.788]  Very, very powerful.
[01:21:40.748 --> 01:21:42.569]  Dead 24 hours later.
[01:21:43.629 --> 01:21:43.930]  Roughly.
[01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:45.971]  But living on.
[01:21:46.691 --> 01:21:50.233]  And that's a universal message of God consciousness and it's so real.
[01:21:52.194 --> 01:21:52.774]  It's so real.
[01:21:53.434 --> 01:21:54.495]  We're gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:21:54.515 --> 01:21:56.356]  We have a special guest joining us coming up as well.
[01:21:56.416 --> 01:21:57.416]  We'll continue with phone calls.
[01:21:59.337 --> 01:22:00.097]  Thank you for giving.
[01:22:01.178 --> 01:22:02.419]  Thank you for supporting the InfoWar.
[01:22:02.879 --> 01:22:04.059]  Thank you for your kindness.
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:14.280]   Because Without InfoWars, I can tell you we would not have exposed these poison shots, and you wouldn't have a 99% reduction in the uptake of them that we now see.
[01:22:14.381 --> 01:22:15.561]  People are rejecting it everywhere.
[01:22:16.121 --> 01:22:24.165]  You and your actions, all of you, have saved millions of lives, including, conservatively, in the aggregate, if they'd have kept this rolling.
[01:22:24.325 --> 01:22:25.946]  They're gonna come back, but we're winning right now.
[01:22:25.966 --> 01:22:28.687]  We're winning this round.
[01:22:29.647 --> 01:22:39.851]   Your actions supporting this broadcast and our guests and what we did here and what unfolded, Saved millions of people.
[01:22:39.971 --> 01:22:40.832]  We did that together.
[01:22:41.352 --> 01:22:42.733]  And this isn't about bragging.
[01:22:44.214 --> 01:22:44.894]  It's not about that.
[01:22:47.576 --> 01:22:50.418]  I got Dr. Peter McCullough and a bunch of others on Joe Rogan.
[01:22:50.978 --> 01:22:52.659]  And they admit that's what finally broke its back.
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:54.661]  Hundreds of millions of views.
[01:22:54.841 --> 01:22:55.601]  His biggest shows ever.
[01:22:56.542 --> 01:22:58.043]  Even dwarfed the ones I did now, and that's great.
[01:22:58.863 --> 01:23:01.185]  I'm glad I'm no longer the number one Joe Rogan interviewer.
[01:23:03.945 --> 01:23:08.688]  And it's not just what I do on air, it's not just what you do calling in on air, it's what you do in person is just as important.
[01:23:09.308 --> 01:23:14.732]  And I made the phone calls, I twisted the arms, I said, you should interview these people.
[01:23:16.073 --> 01:23:16.633]  And it happened.
[01:23:18.414 --> 01:23:24.058]  And so that's what we're talking about here, is that this is a critical operation and we can't continue on without you.
[01:23:25.078 --> 01:23:30.502]  When I tell you that we need funds, you see all the headlines, we have hundreds of millions of dollars, that's a lie so you don't support.
[01:23:31.809 --> 01:23:40.579]  You really want me to prove to you by imploding or shutting down that InfoWars is under globalist attack and barely can pay the bills?
[01:23:42.961 --> 01:23:44.002]  Don't make me prove it to you.
[01:23:44.263 --> 01:23:45.043]  Please just support.
[01:23:45.744 --> 01:23:46.125]  Go now.
[01:23:46.265 --> 01:23:48.007]  Make the personal decision yourself.
[01:23:49.229 --> 01:23:55.374]  To take action at InfoWarsTour.com and get an unsigned copy or do the fundraiser copy for the signed copy.
[01:23:55.734 --> 01:23:59.377]  And I thank you for whether you get the unsigned or the signed at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:23:59.617 --> 01:24:00.378]  Maybe you already read the book.
[01:24:00.398 --> 01:24:01.139]  Maybe you think it's amazing.
[01:24:01.179 --> 01:24:01.939]  Buy 10 copies.
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:03.100]  Give them away.
[01:24:04.582 --> 01:24:09.405]  Whatever you do, please support the broadcast because we really are the most effective operation against the New World Order.
[01:24:09.466 --> 01:24:10.526]  I never intended that to happen.
[01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:11.367]  Didn't know that would happen.
[01:24:13.809 --> 01:24:17.172]  God laid it on me more than 25 years ago when I was already on air a few years.
[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:20.822]  That I was going to wake up the people that would defeat the New World Order.
[01:24:21.443 --> 01:24:22.464]  Through God's action.
[01:24:23.004 --> 01:24:23.525]  And we've done that.
[01:24:23.545 --> 01:24:25.867]  You see how most people say we woke them up.
[01:24:25.927 --> 01:24:26.507]  This broadcast.
[01:24:26.527 --> 01:24:30.371]  Not just me, but the callers, and the guests, and the whole family that's InfoWars.
[01:24:30.391 --> 01:24:31.171]  We did it together.
[01:24:31.431 --> 01:24:32.412]  God did that through us.
[01:24:34.114 --> 01:24:38.938]  So go to InfoWarsTore.com and get a signed copy now of The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:24:38.958 --> 01:24:40.359]  There are millions of people watching and listening.
[01:24:40.419 --> 01:24:42.941]  Only a fraction of you are going to get the book.
[01:24:43.021 --> 01:24:45.844]  If 5% of you went and got the book, our problems of funding would be over.
[01:24:47.233 --> 01:24:52.236]  But even if you can't buy the book or aren't going to buy the book, just share the articles and the videos on your text message or email.
[01:24:52.536 --> 01:24:56.418]  Those are the few places where we can still get information out and realize this is an information war.
[01:24:57.859 --> 01:25:00.301]  You can also get the limited edition Teddy Roosevelt coin.
[01:25:01.501 --> 01:25:04.103]  That again is a fundraiser coin, a piece of history, a piece of art.
[01:25:05.643 --> 01:25:07.264]  Not being sold as an investment in silver.
[01:25:07.304 --> 01:25:12.886]  It's got a big markup on it, because we told you it has a big markup, because we need the funds to stay on air.
[01:25:12.906 --> 01:25:14.306]  It's a fundraiser.
[01:25:14.846 --> 01:25:15.527]  1776coin.com.
[01:25:16.007 --> 01:25:17.007]  There's a limited amount left.
[01:25:17.027 --> 01:25:17.867]  There's about 5,000 left.
[01:25:17.907 --> 01:25:18.788]  We sold half of them.
[01:25:19.288 --> 01:25:21.789]  There'll never be any more of these coins made.
[01:25:22.009 --> 01:25:22.649]  1776coin.com.
[01:25:23.209 --> 01:25:24.590]  Okay, let's go to more callers.
[01:25:24.630 --> 01:25:26.571]  Jeremiah in Washington.
[01:25:26.591 --> 01:25:27.471]  You're on the air, Jeremiah.
[01:25:28.925 --> 01:25:29.865]  Hello, Alex.
[01:25:30.005 --> 01:25:32.246]  Hey, this is Jeremiah from Seattle.
[01:25:32.706 --> 01:25:33.807]  God bless you, man.
[01:25:33.867 --> 01:25:36.208]  You are the man, the myth, the legend.
[01:25:37.388 --> 01:25:38.569]  Thank you for everything you do, man.
[01:25:38.609 --> 01:25:39.889]  The man, the myth, the meatball.
[01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:42.390]  So, enough about me, brother.
[01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:44.631]  What's on your mind today?
[01:25:44.691 --> 01:25:51.193]  So, honestly, I really just wanted to reach out to you guys and give you guys some, you know, product plug, if I could.
[01:25:51.233 --> 01:25:58.116]  You know, the bodies product that you guys have has been crucial for my family.
[01:25:58.993 --> 01:26:04.798]  You know, I'm the youngest one in my family, and I come from a half Asian, you know, background.
[01:26:04.818 --> 01:26:10.082]  So I wish more Asians would come on to your show and speak up more, honestly.
[01:26:11.523 --> 01:26:16.667]  But I know that we like to be the model minority, what have you.
[01:26:16.788 --> 01:26:33.248]   Anyways, just going back to the buddies, you know, I've presented this to My dad and also my mom, and they were skeptical at first to try, you know, to work with this because, you know, they've been having some body joint issues and things like that.
[01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:38.950]  Just even just getting up and down from the couch, you know, it was a strain on them.
[01:26:39.010 --> 01:26:40.450]  So I was like, hey, try this out.
[01:26:40.751 --> 01:26:55.111]   And not even one day later, they came to me and said, probably the first ever praise I've ever got from my parents was, whatever you got from Wherever you got this from, it works fantastic.
[01:26:57.592 --> 01:26:59.833]  Let me say something about that, just briefly.
[01:27:00.393 --> 01:27:03.915]  The average turmeric pill out there works great, it's 5% humanoid.
[01:27:04.375 --> 01:27:10.477]  Ours is the strongest out there, 95%, we pay way more to get the strongest turmeric on the market, period.
[01:27:10.817 --> 01:27:21.143]   My wife has a lot of joint pain, she plays a lot of sports, and she said to me, Well, hey, how is this a lower level of the bottle, but it works better than these big horse pills I take of turmeric?
[01:27:21.163 --> 01:27:22.625]  And I said, honey, because it's concentrated.
[01:27:22.965 --> 01:27:28.429]  And now she takes this and her hip pain, because she plays tennis a lot, is gone.
[01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:31.372]  So, yes, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is that good, brother.
[01:27:31.412 --> 01:27:31.632]  Go ahead.
[01:27:32.694 --> 01:27:33.575]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:27:33.635 --> 01:27:42.906]  And then I just wanted to say, you know, I'm not too much of a, you know, like putting on the t-shirts and whatnot and, you know, giving that out.
[01:27:42.986 --> 01:27:47.852]  But after this helped out my family, you know, I started to hand this out to my friends.
[01:27:48.704 --> 01:27:52.627]  And they have no idea what InfoWars is all about.
[01:27:52.807 --> 01:27:58.750]  But I told them, hey, if you want more of this product, which I gave them an unsealed capsule, you know what I mean?
[01:27:59.031 --> 01:28:00.412]  And I said, hey, this is for you.
[01:28:00.492 --> 01:28:01.392]  Just try it out.
[01:28:01.452 --> 01:28:02.413]  Just give it a shot.
[01:28:02.573 --> 01:28:07.256]  And they also said the next day they didn't even wait 24 hours.
[01:28:07.356 --> 01:28:14.801]  And they told me, dude, I'm already starting to feel like I'm young again, you know, like like like I'm a, you know, basketball player.
[01:28:14.821 --> 01:28:15.461]  Hold on a second.
[01:28:15.341 --> 01:28:17.341]  Hold on a second, hold on a second.
[01:28:17.341 --> 01:28:20.180]  (saxophone music)
[01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:34.921]   ♪ On a long and lonesome highway ♪ ♪ East of Omaha ♪
[01:28:34.921 --> 01:28:40.901]   ♪ You can listen to the engine moaning ♪ ♪ At his one note song ♪
[01:28:40.901 --> 01:28:44.560]   You know, that's something that didn't irritate me 'cause I knew they'd do it.
[01:28:44.985 --> 01:28:53.211]  But when they were up there putting scrambled, mixed text messages up, talking about one product or another to confuse people, they're engaged in pure deception.
[01:28:54.392 --> 01:28:56.173]  They're like, and you sell silver coins, don't you?
[01:28:56.213 --> 01:28:57.054]  You make money off that.
[01:28:57.074 --> 01:28:57.534]  I'm like, yeah.
[01:28:58.214 --> 01:28:59.435]  And you got Bitcoin donations.
[01:28:59.515 --> 01:29:00.536]  You kept that, didn't you?
[01:29:01.157 --> 01:29:01.957]  No, didn't keep it.
[01:29:02.317 --> 01:29:05.880]  Put 95% of it into the company.
[01:29:06.941 --> 01:29:14.247]  There is $60,000 left in there, and I've got to have it because the bankruptcy court ordered me to pay 40% of the legal bills, which I don't have the money for.
[01:29:14.327 --> 01:29:21.754]  So I'm getting ready to launch a fundraiser that's out in the open for Alex Jones, because I am absolutely running out of money.
[01:29:21.774 --> 01:29:22.955]  I have almost no money left.
[01:29:24.216 --> 01:29:27.771]   And I hate coming to you doing this, but you want me to fight the New World Order?
[01:29:27.791 --> 01:29:28.831]  I mean, you don't want me to quit, do you?
[01:29:30.532 --> 01:29:32.473]  In fact, I spend most of my time trying to find money.
[01:29:34.074 --> 01:29:35.374]  And I'm not bitching, I'm not complaining.
[01:29:35.414 --> 01:29:37.915]  Hey, if God wants, maybe I'm about to have a heart attack.
[01:29:37.935 --> 01:29:38.936]  Maybe I've been on air too long.
[01:29:39.296 --> 01:29:41.997]  Maybe it's in God's plan that I don't get the funds.
[01:29:42.717 --> 01:29:45.178]  And if that's it, I'm actually very calm and serene about it.
[01:29:46.459 --> 01:29:48.980]  At least most of the time that I'm like, I can't stop, I gotta fight them harder.
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:50.841]  I gotta get the money, I gotta not let them win!
[01:29:52.145 --> 01:29:53.686]  But they're the ones that are losing.
[01:29:53.927 --> 01:29:55.428]  They're losers for signing on to Satan.
[01:29:56.569 --> 01:30:02.234]  But, uh, when they act like the supplements, they go, those aren't FDA approved, are they?
[01:30:02.874 --> 01:30:07.378]  Now, they know full well in 1996 law, the FDA has no jurisdiction over supplements.
[01:30:08.379 --> 01:30:17.186]  And they tried to ban supplements in 96, but Congress got a good law passed where Ron Paul was involved, where they have no jurisdiction, you just can't advertise a supplement as a drug.
[01:30:17.426 --> 01:30:19.148]  Well, we're not comparing it to your poison drugs.
[01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:21.071]  Turmeric is from India.
[01:30:21.091 --> 01:30:22.973]  Well, that's where it was popularized thousands of years ago.
[01:30:23.853 --> 01:30:26.355]  And it's a natural plant derivative.
[01:30:27.456 --> 01:30:30.959]  And the curcuminoid is what is strong in it.
[01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:34.162]  It's great for inflammation, joints, anti-cancer, you name it.
[01:30:34.918 --> 01:30:39.302]  And so we went to the top companies in the country and we said, what's the strongest curcuminoid you got?
[01:30:39.322 --> 01:30:43.986]  They said, well the average is 4-5% has a great effect, it's just whole turmeric.
[01:30:44.446 --> 01:30:48.450]  But we can concentrate it naturally without heating it up to 75%.
[01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:50.091]  I said, has anybody put out 75%?
[01:30:50.131 --> 01:30:54.715]  They said, yeah, some of these top of the line brands, but nobody goes above that.
[01:30:54.756 --> 01:30:55.516]  I said, how high can you go?
[01:30:55.536 --> 01:30:55.776]  They go 94-95%.
[01:30:55.596 --> 01:31:06.115]   go 94 to 95 percent. 95 percent curcuminoid. Any turmeric that's real turmeric is going
[01:31:06.115 --> 01:31:06.476]  to help you.
[01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:09.751]  This is, let me liken it to whiskey.
[01:31:10.892 --> 01:31:12.813]  A beer is 4%, that's normal turmeric.
[01:31:14.193 --> 01:31:15.394]  This is like moonshine.
[01:31:15.434 --> 01:31:17.155]  This is 200 proof, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:18.415 --> 01:31:23.197]  This is as strong as it gets, but not like having some of the bad health effects that, you know, whiskey can have.
[01:31:23.217 --> 01:31:27.999]  It has some good health effects too, but, you know, the point is, everything in moderation, that's the reality of this.
[01:31:28.019 --> 01:31:30.440]  So I'm glad your family had a great effect, Jeremiah.
[01:31:30.581 --> 01:31:31.421]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:31:35.116 --> 01:31:50.084]  Oh, if I could just kind of plug a few other outlets other than just handing out the supplements to friends and people that I know, which have 100% feedback, phenomenal.
[01:31:50.624 --> 01:31:57.948]  I have not gotten any negative feedback of any of the stuff that I've provided to anybody that was curious about trying to get better health.
[01:31:59.116 --> 01:32:07.545]  So as I mentioned earlier, you know, minorities, we need more of the Asian community to come out and speak up, you know, honestly, in my opinion.
[01:32:07.625 --> 01:32:15.314]  And then outside of that, if we can just plug in, you know, Rumble and also Vaughn Live with the InfoBear.
[01:32:15.854 --> 01:32:23.724]  The InfoBear channel, that's where the community comes to help back you up as much as we can to promote everything on the live stream.
[01:32:24.044 --> 01:32:30.112]  You know, whether it's Vaughn, Rumble, or Twitch, that's what we've been trying to do to help back you up, man.
[01:32:31.153 --> 01:32:38.176]  You are definitely leading the charge, and I know that you're not the tip of the spear, but man, we're definitely backing you up with the other prongs on that, man.
[01:32:38.196 --> 01:32:39.916]  So, God bless you, man.
[01:32:39.936 --> 01:32:41.757]  Thank you for everything you do.
[01:32:42.117 --> 01:32:43.457]  Jeremiah, thank you.
[01:32:43.577 --> 01:32:46.338]  Thank you for what you do, and say hi to your family for me.
[01:32:46.498 --> 01:32:46.839]  All right.
[01:32:49.159 --> 01:32:51.060]  If you hold callers, I'll get to you after our guest is gone.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:51.900]  I appreciate everybody being here.
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:33:07.688]   I got to a lot of calls the last two hours, but there's a lot more to get to, but we have Dr. Kelly Victory, MD, who's been on this before, and she's got incredible information dealing with the latest COVID developments, and Biden, and his cognitive disabilities, and so much more.
[01:33:08.328 --> 01:33:09.549]  This lady is the tip of the spear.
[01:33:09.889 --> 01:33:11.610]  She'll join us on the other side in just a few minutes.
[01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:25.430]  Please stay with us.
[01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:29.430]  [Music]
[01:33:29.497 --> 01:33:31.138]  Can we talk about cryptocurrency?
[01:33:33.318 --> 01:33:41.561]  Because one of the ways that you encourage your audience to give you money is in cryptocurrency donations, right?
[01:33:41.621 --> 01:33:41.901]  Yes.
[01:33:42.542 --> 01:33:45.983]  And you have a page on your website that's just for cryptocurrency donations, right?
[01:33:46.323 --> 01:33:48.164]  InfoWars.com forward slash crypto.
[01:33:48.224 --> 01:33:50.885]  Is that a little advertisement just there?
[01:33:51.025 --> 01:33:52.065]  Well, we're fighting the deep state.
[01:33:52.085 --> 01:33:52.585]  We need money.
[01:33:52.605 --> 01:33:53.025]  All right.
[01:33:53.966 --> 01:33:54.646]  This is it.
[01:33:55.266 --> 01:33:56.146]  Get crypto.
[01:33:56.286 --> 01:33:57.387]  Fund InfoWars.
[01:33:58.211 --> 01:34:01.393]  Sponsor us with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, right?
[01:34:01.914 --> 01:34:04.476]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight.
[01:34:04.496 --> 01:34:07.298]  Your advertisement for your cryptocurrency page.
[01:34:07.838 --> 01:34:12.262]  You know, I mean, I mean, people want to keep us in the fight.
[01:34:12.342 --> 01:34:15.584]  So I mean, I hope whoever the big whales are, they'll give us money before we keep going.
[01:34:16.044 --> 01:34:18.286]  We'll just keep, we'll just keep.
[01:34:18.326 --> 01:34:19.107]  We need some money, guys.
[01:34:19.127 --> 01:34:19.907]  You're in this courtroom.
[01:34:19.967 --> 01:34:20.908]  Objections.
[01:34:21.849 --> 01:34:23.490]  All right, let's move on.
[01:34:23.550 --> 01:34:24.651]  People care about the First Amendment.
[01:34:29.451 --> 01:34:30.772]  Don't listen to corporate media.
[01:34:30.792 --> 01:34:31.972]  Don't listen to the establishment.
[01:34:31.992 --> 01:34:33.633]  Don't listen to Republican, Democrat leaders.
[01:34:33.853 --> 01:34:34.773]  Don't listen to think tanks.
[01:34:35.173 --> 01:34:42.457]  You want to hear why they fear Infowars.com, you want to hear why they fear Alex Jones, go to Infowars.com and actually hear my show.
[01:34:42.917 --> 01:34:43.717]  Watch what we say.
[01:34:44.097 --> 01:34:44.898]  Watch what we do.
[01:34:45.258 --> 01:34:46.158]  See what we really say.
[01:34:46.178 --> 01:34:53.061]  And we're not going to defeat these people until we admit they're evil, we admit it's going on, and we organize against them, and we stop them.
[01:34:53.081 --> 01:34:57.143]  This man is more hated by the media than Donald Trump, and that says something, okay?
[01:34:57.583 --> 01:35:00.566]  That's why they hate us, is we're very, very popular populous.
[01:35:00.606 --> 01:35:04.109]  I have the number one book in the world, The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[01:35:04.429 --> 01:35:05.630]  It exposes Klaus Schwab.
[01:35:05.831 --> 01:35:06.872]  It exposes Bill Gates.
[01:35:07.172 --> 01:35:09.154]  It exposes the New World Order with their own quotes.
[01:35:09.554 --> 01:35:10.435]  Number one book in the world.
[01:35:10.755 --> 01:35:15.680]  And liberals and conservatives and everybody are buying it because they want to hear what they're not supposed to hear.
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:21.165]  Alex Jones has the biggest book in the country, but the New York Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that.
[01:35:22.179 --> 01:35:38.173]  Listen, if you want to hear unfiltered, sometimes we're wrong, sometimes we're right, if you want to hear unfiltered, real analysis from a wild man from Texas, from the Texas Tornado, go to InfoWars.com, and the audio and video feeds, and what we say are there, and I ask the public to judge me for yourself.
[01:35:38.714 --> 01:35:42.056]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[01:35:42.837 --> 01:35:46.418]  They're in fear of the truth that he does actually bring out.
[01:35:46.639 --> 01:35:57.583]  But at the end of the day, if you want to know the truth, just research it for yourself and come to InfoWars.com and see the forbidden information that you're not supposed to see at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:57.643 --> 01:36:05.666]  The COVID narrative is collapsing right now before our eyes.
[01:36:07.466 --> 01:36:12.929]  In Canada, in the United States, in Australia, in Europe, the criminal investigations have begun.
[01:36:12.949 --> 01:36:31.420]  We are announcing that the Government of Canada will not renew the order in Council that expires on September the 30th and will therefore remove all COVID-19 border requirements for all travellers entering Canada.
[01:36:32.426 --> 01:36:43.270]  This includes the removal of all federal testing, quarantine and isolation requirements, as well as a mandatory submission of health information in a riot camp.
[01:36:44.010 --> 01:36:48.492]  And now, the criminal investigations are beginning in Congress and more.
[01:36:49.012 --> 01:36:52.794]  I'm Fauci and those responsible for creating and releasing the bioweapon.
[01:36:54.531 --> 01:37:00.019]  And then you've even taken a step further defining that as calling for a special counsel.
[01:37:00.059 --> 01:37:05.767]  I wonder if you could unpack that for us and explain what exactly the parameters of that special counsel would be.
[01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:11.713]  You know, there have been special counsels in the past that are appointed by the president.
[01:37:11.753 --> 01:37:13.514]  There's a special counsel law.
[01:37:14.134 --> 01:37:17.516]  What I'm talking about is something that is similar but won't be the same thing.
[01:37:17.557 --> 01:37:19.438]  This won't be under a special law.
[01:37:19.918 --> 01:37:37.630]  This would simply be as the chairman of a committee with subpoena power, I will appoint someone who has the bandwidth, someone who's either been a former attorney general or assistant attorney general or somebody that had been in the Department of Justice at some time, somebody who's capable of leading a large investigation.
[01:37:38.411 --> 01:37:50.282]  And if I am in charge of the committee, not only someone who is probably a lawyer, but I also envision having a special investigator that co-leads the investigation that will be a scientist.
[01:37:50.783 --> 01:38:04.656]   Because I think what happens, and one of the reasons Dr. Fauci was successful in the beginning, is that As a person who came with a medical background, I think he can talk circles around people who aren't as familiar with the science.
[01:38:05.176 --> 01:38:14.523]  But there are a lot of scientists who have questions about particularly this gain-of-function research where they juice up these viruses and make them more infectious.
[01:38:15.103 --> 01:38:37.938]   There are many experts that have at least the credentials of a Dr. Fauci or some of them with much greater credentials who have been saying for years There's at least one scientist who's been talking about this for 16 years before the pandemic, warning that this could come from a lab because of dangerous research, and we didn't.
[01:38:38.398 --> 01:38:43.961]  The public, Congress, didn't heed his warnings, and lo and behold, it's happened, and in a big way.
[01:38:44.441 --> 01:38:53.188]   And I think by the time we're done with the investigation, by the time we present this to the public, I think people are going to go, holy cow, this thing came from a lab.
[01:38:53.648 --> 01:38:55.269]  Not just some of us are going to believe that.
[01:38:55.750 --> 01:39:02.536]  I think the majority of people will finally accept that the preponderance of evidence says that this came from a lab.
[01:39:03.557 --> 01:39:11.184]  Well, I think that so much of this comes, goes, and really... Dr. Kelly, Victory MD.
[01:39:12.265 --> 01:39:23.249]  Alumni of National Preparedness Leadership Initiative of the Harvard School of Public Health and so much more joins us and she was really exposing us the last two plus years.
[01:39:23.829 --> 01:39:25.389]  We're going to get into all the COVID news coming up.
[01:39:25.449 --> 01:39:32.191]  She also wants to get into Biden's clear dementia and as a medical doctor what she's seeing unfolding.
[01:39:32.211 --> 01:39:34.012]  So Dr. Victory, great to have you here with us today.
[01:39:35.202 --> 01:39:44.365]  Thanks as always for having me, Alex, and I appreciate you taking the time to address this issue of Biden's worsening cognitive and physical decline.
[01:39:44.705 --> 01:39:53.748]  People seem to be really scooting around the edges of this issue and not really getting into the weeds and exposing it to the American people.
[01:39:53.788 --> 01:39:54.928]  It's critically important.
[01:39:54.968 --> 01:39:57.189]  We're talking about the leader of the free world.
[01:39:57.649 --> 01:40:05.832]  So happy to talk about anything COVID related, but really appreciate the opportunity to talk about Biden's situation.
[01:40:07.753 --> 01:40:10.394]  Should we get into Biden first or the huge vaccine developments?
[01:40:12.017 --> 01:40:14.799]  Well, let's talk about Biden first.
[01:40:15.179 --> 01:40:24.305]  Let's talk about Biden only because, and let me be clear, everything we're going to talk about, everything I'm going to mention today, none of this is new.
[01:40:24.445 --> 01:40:30.429]  This was all readily apparent to anyone who was looking well before the 2020 election.
[01:40:30.769 --> 01:40:34.371]  The only thing that has changed is that it has worsened.
[01:40:34.712 --> 01:40:46.319]   I actually lost a number of steak dinners because I had predicted that if Biden got elected, That he wouldn't make it until July 1st of his first year in office.
[01:40:46.919 --> 01:40:47.659]  I was wrong.
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:52.282]  But what I was wrong about wasn't about the severity of his decline.
[01:40:52.742 --> 01:41:07.371]  I simply misunderstood or underestimated the complicity of the Democrat Party, of the mainstream media, of the powers that be, to rally around and protect him and to try to keep this covered up.
[01:41:08.151 --> 01:41:12.113]  It's not because I wasn't correct about what's going on with him.
[01:41:13.073 --> 01:41:13.894]  I totally agree.
[01:41:13.954 --> 01:41:17.635]  I mean, I would liken this to the Manhattan Project of gaslighting.
[01:41:17.916 --> 01:41:18.936]  He doesn't know where he is.
[01:41:19.016 --> 01:41:20.437]  It's almost all incoherent.
[01:41:20.817 --> 01:41:22.718]  My grandmother died a few years ago at 92.
[01:41:23.138 --> 01:41:27.440]  She was more coherent two days before she died when I visited her than he is now.
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:30.241]  I mean, why are they trying to prop him up?
[01:41:31.661 --> 01:41:38.847]  Well, let me, you know, truly, number one, look at the second in command, look at, you know, who's to follow.
[01:41:38.907 --> 01:41:52.678]  I think Kamala Harris is his greatest protector right now because people think it's bad enough to have somebody demented in the office, but having her could be considerably worse.
[01:41:53.518 --> 01:41:56.481]  And now, I have not examined President Biden.
[01:41:56.901 --> 01:42:02.364]  But I can tell you, he is every outward sign of Parkinsonian dementia.
[01:42:02.664 --> 01:42:05.365]  The physical signs and the cognitive signs.
[01:42:05.425 --> 01:42:06.446]  We can go through them.
[01:42:06.886 --> 01:42:09.967]  He's got the telltale signs of the shuffling gate.
[01:42:10.428 --> 01:42:14.049]  He has trouble changing direction when he starts forward motion.
[01:42:14.069 --> 01:42:19.052]  And you'll commonly see someone take him by the elbow and literally turn him physically.
[01:42:19.972 --> 01:42:22.834]  He's got the stiff kind of tin soldier arms.
[01:42:23.254 --> 01:42:26.775]  He has a loss of facial expression, what we call flat faces.
[01:42:26.955 --> 01:42:32.658]  Makes it look sometimes like he's gotten a little too much Botox, but I can guarantee that's not the case.
[01:42:32.718 --> 01:42:34.999]  This is part of Parkinsonian dementia.
[01:42:35.689 --> 01:42:37.511]  He has trouble word finding.
[01:42:37.751 --> 01:42:40.473]  He frequently loses his place on the teleprompter.
[01:42:40.654 --> 01:42:42.654]  he loses his train of thought.
[01:42:42.654 --> 01:42:45.154]  Hold on, doctor. I got you late playing those clips.
[01:42:45.154 --> 01:42:48.154]  I promise you I apologize. Stay there. Start over.
[01:42:48.154 --> 01:42:50.654]  Because I hadn't seen the new clips that came this morning.
[01:42:50.654 --> 01:42:52.154]  They were just playing them while you were talking.
[01:42:52.154 --> 01:42:53.654]  Radio listeners couldn't see it.
[01:42:53.654 --> 01:42:58.154]  He literally does not know what planet he's on now.
[01:42:58.102 --> 01:43:01.044]  It's obviously accelerating in his degeneration.
[01:43:01.785 --> 01:43:04.146]  Statistically, medically, how is this going to end?
[01:43:04.186 --> 01:43:05.027]  What's the timeline?
[01:43:05.347 --> 01:43:07.688]  We'll be right back with Dr. Kelly Victory, MD.
[01:43:07.809 --> 01:43:11.809]   Be sure to visit her website and on Twitter @KellyVictoryMD on Getter.
[01:43:34.809 --> 01:43:42.809]   Open borders, devalued currencies, drag queen pedophile story time, war with Russia, devalued culture.
[01:43:43.277 --> 01:43:44.457]  They're shaking us up.
[01:43:44.477 --> 01:43:45.417]  They're demoralizing us.
[01:43:45.437 --> 01:43:46.338]  They're trying to break our will.
[01:43:46.858 --> 01:43:47.718]  They admit they are.
[01:43:47.818 --> 01:43:53.320]  And so they put in a president they know is controllable and is a puppet, but his expiration date was up.
[01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:55.841]  So he's degenerating, in my view, faster than they thought.
[01:43:56.241 --> 01:43:58.521]  Medical doctor Kelly Victory is here.
[01:43:58.541 --> 01:44:06.539]   She said she's not diagnosing him with dementia from afar, but I don't have to be a doctor that if I'm Looking out my window at a highway and a homeless person
[01:44:06.539 --> 01:44:11.509]   walks out in front of a truck, I saw this happen years ago, and gets run over and killed, I see him run over and fly
[01:44:11.509 --> 01:44:13.859]  into the air, that person's probably dead.
[01:44:13.859 --> 01:44:19.618]   Don't need to be a pathologist, you know, to know that that person, a coroner to know that person just got run over by
[01:44:19.618 --> 01:44:19.859]  a car.
[01:44:19.859 --> 01:44:26.538]   So we see him a year ago falling down Air Force One, he looked, it looks like he's an NFL linebacker or running
[01:44:26.538 --> 01:44:29.889]   back compared to the way he looks in the new footage of things
[01:44:29.889 --> 01:44:30.859]  that he's seeing.
[01:44:30.685 --> 01:44:39.491]  So, start over with what you're witnessing, what you're seeing, and the classical thing we're witnessing and where this trajectory or timeline ends.
[01:44:39.771 --> 01:44:40.852]  Dr. Kelly Victory, MD.
[01:44:42.768 --> 01:44:43.068]  Sure.
[01:44:43.309 --> 01:44:49.994]  Let me first give a quick rundown of the sorts of physical signs and symptoms that I'm seeing.
[01:44:50.294 --> 01:44:54.298]  And again, you know, one swallow doesn't make a summer as the saying goes.
[01:44:54.698 --> 01:44:58.741]  It's a constellation of all of these signs taken together.
[01:44:58.981 --> 01:45:01.603]  Alex, this is second year medical student stuff.
[01:45:02.204 --> 01:45:03.985]  So I didn't need to examine him.
[01:45:04.065 --> 01:45:05.667]  I can see with my own eyes.
[01:45:06.247 --> 01:45:12.335]  He has the shuffling gate, as I said, difficulty changing direction once he starts forward motion.
[01:45:12.736 --> 01:45:15.800]  He is stiff, what we call tin soldier arms.
[01:45:16.261 --> 01:45:18.564]  He has that somewhat, you know, leaning forward.
[01:45:18.584 --> 01:45:25.164]   He's leaning forward normally than one would As he walks, when he walks, he doesn't hit his heel first.
[01:45:25.504 --> 01:45:26.805]  He hits flat footed.
[01:45:27.606 --> 01:45:31.249]  He has loss of facial expression, what we call flat faces.
[01:45:31.870 --> 01:45:36.394]  Then when you look at the cognitive things, he has trouble with word finding.
[01:45:36.674 --> 01:45:40.377]  He frequently loses his place when he's reading on the teleprompter.
[01:45:40.817 --> 01:45:42.519]  He forgets his train of thought.
[01:45:43.059 --> 01:46:00.826]  And interestingly, he has those angry, inappropriate outbursts that we call frontal lobe behavior, who can forget back in 2020 when he referred to a girl at a town hall as a lying, dog-faced pony soldier, or where he told an auto worker to shut up.
[01:46:01.286 --> 01:46:09.709]  These are frontal lobe behaviors, behaviors that are impulsive and would normally be controlled by somebody who wasn't suffering from dementia.
[01:46:10.552 --> 01:46:17.378]  The problem with these neurocognitive disorders from which he is suffering is that they are progressive.
[01:46:17.638 --> 01:46:19.019]  There is no cure.
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:21.481]  They are not linear, unfortunately.
[01:46:21.781 --> 01:46:27.366]  So there's no way to say with certainty how quickly he will fall off the proverbial cliff.
[01:46:27.626 --> 01:46:32.410]  But clearly we are seeing significant worsening over the past couple of years.
[01:46:33.472 --> 01:46:42.030]  And the only reason that he's functioning at all, in my estimation, is because they are very, very tightly controlling his schedule.
[01:46:42.856 --> 01:46:48.480]  You'll notice that he rarely makes an appearance after about two or three in the afternoon.
[01:46:48.921 --> 01:46:54.985]  That's because people with this type of neurocognitive decline suffer from what we call sundowning.
[01:46:55.386 --> 01:47:06.814]  While they may be relatively coherent and cogent early in the day, as the day gets later, early afternoon, they start to get more and more agitated, more and more confused.
[01:47:06.874 --> 01:47:07.595]  Oh, I saw this!
[01:47:07.875 --> 01:47:14.746]  Three of my grandparents, that they'd be somewhat normal when they got Alzheimer's or old during the day, but if you showed up at night to help them they didn't know who they were.
[01:47:15.327 --> 01:47:15.488]  Yes.
[01:47:16.358 --> 01:47:25.226]  Exactly, and that's why I suspect that he rarely ventures out of the house after about 2 or 3 in the afternoon.
[01:47:25.326 --> 01:47:29.870]  I've also noticed he's spending something like 60% of his time hidden on vacation.
[01:47:29.890 --> 01:47:32.352]  I mean, and unannounced he just disappears.
[01:47:32.392 --> 01:47:37.336]  Is that when he has a full collapse and basically he's no good to them?
[01:47:37.356 --> 01:47:37.917]  They've got to hide him?
[01:47:39.301 --> 01:47:39.742]  Exactly.
[01:47:39.782 --> 01:47:59.262]  And if there's any disruption of the schedule, and what's so alarming to me and scary to me, Alex, for the leader of the free world, is you can kind of keep it together with these folks as long as breakfast is exactly on time and lunch is on time and that nap is on time and we do everything in a routine, kind of like a newborn baby.
[01:47:59.742 --> 01:48:16.208]  But as soon as you disrupt that, if you have to take a phone call at 3 o'clock in the morning, if you have to get on Air Force One and travel over multiple time zones, if you have to miss a meal or have disruption in your normal routine, that is when things get really bad.
[01:48:16.488 --> 01:48:21.870]  People get agitated and confused and totally lose their ability to function.
[01:48:22.250 --> 01:48:31.135]   And so it's one thing if you can Absolutely control this person's day, their schedule, seven days a week with no variation.
[01:48:31.415 --> 01:48:32.075]  But that's not reasonable.
[01:48:32.095 --> 01:48:32.335]  That's right.
[01:48:32.355 --> 01:48:37.538]  Even men and women in great shape as prime ministers or presidents have problem and age rapidly.
[01:48:37.618 --> 01:48:42.761]  So looking at this, what you're saying is the guy that has the nuclear football doesn't know what planet he's on.
[01:48:44.309 --> 01:48:48.111]  Yeah, I think he probably doesn't know which end of the fork to use most of the time.
[01:48:48.911 --> 01:48:57.314]  And unfortunately, the people who care about him for his own dignity, for his own, I mean, this is, it's embarrassing.
[01:48:57.594 --> 01:49:09.019]  Not only does it put us at risk from a national security perspective, but truly it is demeaning to him, the people around him who care about him.
[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:12.202]  Where is Dr. Jill right about now?
[01:49:13.182 --> 01:49:26.413]  It is just abhorrent that they would allow this to go on, allow him to embarrass himself, to be clearly like a little lost puppy on the stage, no idea which way to go, doesn't know he'll even articulate sometimes.
[01:49:26.993 --> 01:49:27.994]  What was I doing here?
[01:49:28.054 --> 01:49:29.335]  What was I supposed to say?
[01:49:29.775 --> 01:49:31.276]  Who was I supposed to call on?
[01:49:31.756 --> 01:49:33.497]  Well, he does that sometimes.
[01:49:33.577 --> 01:49:35.638]  He does that almost every public appearance.
[01:49:36.079 --> 01:49:38.240]  He suddenly slips out of gear and doesn't know where he is.
[01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:43.603]  So, it's hard to put a date on when he goes over the edge, but it looks to me like he's already pretty much gone over it.
[01:49:44.124 --> 01:49:46.405]  On average, doctor, you're an MD, you study these things.
[01:49:47.025 --> 01:49:49.587]  If he's accelerating his decline, how long can he hold on?
[01:49:51.488 --> 01:49:54.810]  Well, again, it depends, Alex, on how long they're willing to cover for him.
[01:49:54.890 --> 01:50:00.713]  As I said, all of these things were glaringly evident before the 2020 election.
[01:50:00.893 --> 01:50:04.094]  That's why I made the steak dinner bets that I did.
[01:50:04.875 --> 01:50:08.696]  The dog-faced pony soldier episode was in February of 2020.
[01:50:10.257 --> 01:50:16.581]  He had the shuffling gait and the flat facial expression and the tin soldier arms back then.
[01:50:16.961 --> 01:50:22.965]  So it really is all going to be based on how long they're willing to cover for him.
[01:50:23.025 --> 01:50:29.109]  You know, whether or not somebody is going to go down the road of saying, we need to enact the 25th Amendment.
[01:50:29.749 --> 01:50:37.616]  If the people around him continue to cover for him, they continue to hide him in the basement, they continue to limit his activities.
[01:50:38.317 --> 01:50:42.380]  I have known house cats that had busier schedules than this president.
[01:50:43.321 --> 01:50:48.205]  So as long as they're willing to do that, then who knows if he can make it through the first term.
[01:50:48.845 --> 01:50:49.646]  God help us.
[01:50:50.086 --> 01:50:53.769]  I can't imagine that he will choose to run a second term.
[01:50:53.829 --> 01:50:56.692]  I think by that point, the gig will be up.
[01:50:57.472 --> 01:51:04.537]  But I think as long as Kamala Harris is the person waiting in the wings, they have a lot of motivation to keep covering for him.
[01:51:04.557 --> 01:51:04.657]  Sure.
[01:51:05.377 --> 01:51:07.219]  Well, I mean, we're going to go to break, come back and talk more about this.
[01:51:07.239 --> 01:51:08.399]  There could be a more important issue.
[01:51:08.599 --> 01:51:10.721]  The leader of the free world stole the election as a puppet.
[01:51:10.761 --> 01:51:12.422]  But I'm not a medical doctor.
[01:51:12.462 --> 01:51:14.423]  I'm not a physiologist.
[01:51:14.463 --> 01:51:15.404]  I'm not a pathologist.
[01:51:15.424 --> 01:51:20.147]  So all I know is that Joe Biden, even two years ago, was light years better than this.
[01:51:20.467 --> 01:51:21.808]  The decline is accelerating.
[01:51:21.988 --> 01:51:23.569]  I don't think anybody can deny that.
[01:51:25.879 --> 01:51:28.280]  No, I think that's absolutely the case.
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:30.181]  And as I said, it gives me no great joy.
[01:51:30.841 --> 01:51:34.383]  Dementia is a brutal master, Alex.
[01:51:34.763 --> 01:51:35.463]  It's awful.
[01:51:35.543 --> 01:51:39.625]  It's awful for the individual and it's awful for the people around him.
[01:51:40.765 --> 01:51:47.588]  So I feel very badly for him as an individual, as a person, as a human being, because dementia is terrible.
[01:51:47.928 --> 01:51:54.331]  And these types of cognitive declines and neurocognitive disorders are very, very painful.
[01:51:54.631 --> 01:51:56.593]  All right, Dr. Kelly, victory.
[01:51:56.953 --> 01:51:57.553]  Stay there, please.
[01:51:57.573 --> 01:51:58.734]  We'll come back and talk about this more.
[01:52:01.477 --> 01:52:19.551]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:52:20.812 --> 01:52:21.413]  But guess what?
[01:52:21.433 --> 01:52:22.214]  We got a lot to do.
[01:52:24.121 --> 01:52:24.981]  I gotta say hi to me.
[01:52:27.462 --> 01:52:28.742]  We go back a long way.
[01:52:29.683 --> 01:52:31.843]  She was 12, I was 30, but anyway.
[01:52:34.284 --> 01:52:36.125]  This woman helped me get an awful lot done.
[01:52:36.265 --> 01:52:36.665]  Anyway.
[01:52:39.586 --> 01:52:40.586]  Everybody under 15.
[01:52:40.626 --> 01:52:41.006]  Come here.
[01:52:41.026 --> 01:52:41.366]  Come on.
[01:52:41.386 --> 01:52:42.027]  What's your name?
[01:52:42.047 --> 01:52:42.547]  Come on.
[01:52:42.587 --> 01:52:43.327]  What's your name?
[01:52:43.367 --> 01:52:43.607]  Will?
[01:52:43.627 --> 01:52:44.407]  Come on, you guys.
[01:52:44.467 --> 01:52:45.228]  Y'all look over here.
[01:52:45.047 --> 01:52:47.047]  [LAUGHTER]
[01:52:47.047 --> 01:52:49.047]  [INAUDIBLE]
[01:52:49.047 --> 01:52:51.047]  Well, come on, you guys.
[01:52:51.047 --> 01:52:52.047]  Y'all look over here.
[01:52:52.047 --> 01:52:55.047]  Come on, honey.
[01:52:55.047 --> 01:52:56.047]  I got a daughter.
[01:52:56.047 --> 01:52:57.047]  She's in the States.
[01:52:57.047 --> 01:52:59.047]  Come on.
[01:52:59.047 --> 01:53:01.047]  [INAUDIBLE]
[01:53:01.047 --> 01:53:02.047]  All right.
[01:53:02.047 --> 01:53:03.047]  Come on over here.
[01:53:03.047 --> 01:53:05.047]  Come on, baby.
[01:53:05.047 --> 01:53:08.047]  [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:08.047 --> 01:53:09.047]  Look at him.
[01:53:09.047 --> 01:53:11.047]  Kiss him.
[01:53:11.047 --> 01:53:13.047]  The children are scared of him.
[01:53:13.047 --> 01:53:17.047]  [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:17.047 --> 01:53:19.047]  [APPLAUSE]
[01:53:19.047 --> 01:53:22.047]  [MUSIC - THE KING, "NICE GUY"]
[01:53:22.047 --> 01:53:25.047]  Feeling me.
[01:53:25.047 --> 01:53:28.887]  No more with the nice guy.
[01:53:28.155 --> 01:53:30.836]  So the real question is, who really is the president?
[01:53:31.617 --> 01:53:40.502]  That makes me think of the mutant, I don't say that mainly, he is a mutant, Fetterman, running for Senate in Pennsylvania, who can't talk either.
[01:53:41.163 --> 01:53:43.664]  So maybe this is by design or something.
[01:53:44.505 --> 01:53:48.727]  Dr. Kelly Victory, MD, is doing a great job analyzing this for us.
[01:53:49.308 --> 01:53:52.129]  I've been interrupting a lot and I apologize, so you've got the floor.
[01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:54.851]  What does this signify and where do you see this going?
[01:53:56.567 --> 01:54:07.011]  Well, if you remember nothing else about what I'm talking about with regard to the cognitive decline of President Biden, it's that it is progressive and it is non-linear.
[01:54:07.591 --> 01:54:13.853]  Neurocognitive decline, neurocognitive diseases of this sort don't have a cure.
[01:54:14.513 --> 01:54:19.155]  They may be giving him medication to try to address some of the signs and symptoms.
[01:54:19.516 --> 01:54:26.819]  You can try to treat the physical rigidity, for example, the rigidity of the arms and legs and his balance issues.
[01:54:26.859 --> 01:54:34.883]  You can try to increase the amount of dopamine that he has in his brain so that you will enhance his ability to keep a train of thought.
[01:54:35.123 --> 01:54:36.964]  But there's no cure for it, Alex.
[01:54:37.444 --> 01:54:39.185]  It's progressive and non-linear.
[01:54:39.406 --> 01:54:51.515]  And the problem is, what that means is we don't know if tomorrow will be the day that he finally can't put two words together, can't get out of bed, becomes incontinent, has angry outbursts in public, or whatever else.
[01:54:52.095 --> 01:54:53.476]  Oh, let me interrupt you.
[01:54:53.716 --> 01:54:55.558]  I talk to people in the Secret Service.
[01:54:56.358 --> 01:55:02.729]  Separately, who confirmed a year ago, he was in New York on the last 9-11 anniversary, pooping himself repeatedly.
[01:55:02.749 --> 01:55:06.956]  And then he came out and said, yeah, I get my butt wiped to the TV cameras.
[01:55:06.976 --> 01:55:07.337]  Remember that?
[01:55:09.071 --> 01:55:24.689]  Yeah, unfortunately, incontinence is one of the many side effects of these types of neurocognitive decline, and there are medications you can use to try to temporize it, but the reality is it's going to get worse.
[01:55:25.170 --> 01:55:32.017]   And when you're talking again about the leader of the free world, what happens when he calls And he's also contradicting official U.S.
[01:55:32.057 --> 01:55:33.318]  policy, like on Taiwan and things.
[01:55:33.137 --> 01:55:39.497]   a lying pony soldier, you know, or says some kind of an angry outburst. I mean
[01:55:39.497 --> 01:55:43.817]   these things really he shouldn't be put in that position and there's no question.
[01:55:43.817 --> 01:55:50.016]   He's also contradicting official US policy like on Taiwan and things. This is
[01:55:50.016 --> 01:55:55.176]  extremely dangerous. Absolutely.
[01:55:53.355 --> 01:55:53.935]  Absolutely.
[01:55:53.975 --> 01:55:57.116]  And frankly, I think he's handed his talking points.
[01:55:57.156 --> 01:56:02.158]  He's as much as tells us so at every single, you know, meeting that he has.
[01:56:02.198 --> 01:56:06.539]  He says, I'm only supposed to call on these people and my, you know, my handlers are going to be mad.
[01:56:06.559 --> 01:56:08.040]  I don't want to get in trouble.
[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:10.739]  I don't want to get in trouble.
[01:56:10.739 --> 01:56:14.219]  He's not making his own decisions on these things.
[01:56:14.219 --> 01:56:17.099]   He probably gets his same talking points in the morning as the Secretary.
[01:56:17.099 --> 01:56:22.140]   So on the outside, because I agree, I bet he couldn't go this long, but they don't care,
[01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:23.140]  they're shameless.
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:25.300]  You didn't lose the bet, I didn't lose the bet.
[01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:28.140]  He's a total disgrace and a joke and it's very sad.
[01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:31.779]  But on the outside, could he go six months, a year?
[01:56:31.779 --> 01:56:32.899]  The decline has accelerated.
[01:56:32.908 --> 01:56:39.618]  I mean, I guess if they roll him out like Boris Yeltsin, gibbering in a wheelchair, I guess he could probably win the election in two years.
[01:56:39.638 --> 01:56:43.244]  He'll just have a vegetable or a brain in a tank, they claim, as the president.
[01:56:43.584 --> 01:56:45.227]  And then the question is, who really is the president?
[01:56:46.676 --> 01:56:52.281]  Well, again, there's no way to predict because of the non-linear nature of these disorders.
[01:56:52.861 --> 01:57:00.568]  He may continue to percolate along just as he is right now, you know, for the next six months or nine months or 12 months.
[01:57:00.888 --> 01:57:02.349]  It's unlikely, but he could.
[01:57:02.930 --> 01:57:05.432]  What I can tell you won't happen is it won't get better.
[01:57:05.771 --> 01:57:08.332]  It will not start to abate.
[01:57:08.332 --> 01:57:13.530]   It will stay where it is and slowly and progressively get worse, but there will come a time when
[01:57:13.530 --> 01:57:18.530]   he just kind of falls off the proverbial cliff, and we don't know when that is.
[01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:23.451]   So you're never in the best position to be making those choices and those changes as
[01:57:23.451 --> 01:57:25.810]  a country in a time of crisis.
[01:57:25.605 --> 01:57:30.925]   We should have been doing this in a thoughtful way with a transition plan in
[01:57:30.925 --> 01:57:36.505]   place for someone who is clearly suffering. He is both, as I said, both the
[01:57:36.505 --> 01:57:40.784]   cognitive and the physical components of it. The cognitive being far more
[01:57:40.784 --> 01:57:45.465]   concerning, although we can laugh about him, you know, stumbling on the steps or
[01:57:45.465 --> 01:57:51.465]   make fun of the fact that he falls off a bike. Sure, is this early onset dementia? Is it early, mid, or late?
[01:57:51.465 --> 01:57:55.465]  I'd say we're relatively advanced.
[01:57:54.547 --> 01:57:55.607]  He has every sign.
[01:57:55.667 --> 01:57:57.288]  As I said, we're relatively advanced.
[01:57:57.328 --> 01:58:03.170]  This isn't just a little trouble word finding or losing your ability to track on the teleprompter.
[01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:07.071]  He forgets where he is mid-event.
[01:58:07.271 --> 01:58:07.771]  Right there.
[01:58:07.811 --> 01:58:09.332]  You're watching him right there.
[01:58:09.672 --> 01:58:12.093]  He doesn't know what he's supposed to do.
[01:58:12.413 --> 01:58:14.414]  And this isn't the first episode of that.
[01:58:14.714 --> 01:58:16.875]  He is a lost, you know, little puppy.
[01:58:18.255 --> 01:58:24.920]  Sure, but Doctor, what does this say about his controllers that they let this farce continue?
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:26.281]  As you said, this is ridiculous!
[01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:28.120]  Exactly.
[01:58:28.161 --> 01:58:30.282]  As I said, it's an embarrassment to him.
[01:58:30.302 --> 01:58:35.406]  It's really demeaning to him, and it's dangerous for us as a country.
[01:58:36.187 --> 01:58:46.695]  I think that, frankly, both his handlers and, frankly, the Republicans need to step up and say, for the love of God, we have got to stop trying to cover this up.
[01:58:47.034 --> 01:58:49.034]  We've got to stop trying to sugarcoat this.
[01:58:49.034 --> 01:58:50.034]  Well, exactly.
[01:58:50.034 --> 01:58:53.114]   Democrats want to be able to blame him for their agenda as a puppet.
[01:58:53.114 --> 01:58:55.233]  Republicans love it that he's an idiot.
[01:58:55.233 --> 01:58:56.234]  It makes them get votes.
[01:58:56.234 --> 01:58:58.114]  If we have nuclear war, that doesn't matter.
[01:58:58.114 --> 01:59:00.634]  We cannot have a potato as the president.
[01:59:00.634 --> 01:59:01.634]  Correct.
[01:59:02.636 --> 01:59:19.301]  And frankly, to bring us back around to the COVID situation, because he's constantly contradicting what the talking heads are saying, he's constantly contradicting everybody from Fauci to Walensky and everybody else, it continues to confuse the American public.
[01:59:19.361 --> 01:59:23.222]  It continues to undermine people's confidence in public health.
[01:59:23.882 --> 01:59:25.322]  And it isn't good for anybody.
[01:59:25.562 --> 01:59:37.905]  So whether it's foreign affairs we're talking about, national security we're talking about, or the issues regarding COVID and the pandemic on our own soil, it's very, very disruptive.
[01:59:37.925 --> 01:59:40.186]  Alright, I want to hit that next segment, but let me interrupt you.
[01:59:40.486 --> 01:59:49.248]  Because everybody, even Tucker Carlson brought this up and said, what is the giant, looks like a five-pound tumor on the back of Fetterman's neck.
[01:59:49.348 --> 01:59:50.968]  Fetterman can barely talk now.
[01:59:51.870 --> 01:59:53.451]  The media is trying to cover that up.
[01:59:54.552 --> 02:00:00.496]  Just looking at a giant bulge on the back of his neck, I know you're not diagnosing him from afar, but had a big stroke.
[02:00:01.217 --> 02:00:04.419]  Is that some type of tumor or what's going on here?
[02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:10.883]  Well, again, as you point out, I have not examined Fetterman and I haven't put my hand on that.
[02:00:10.963 --> 02:00:20.770]  The two things that jump to mind right off the bat, number one is completely benign, would be a large fatty tumor, kind of a lipoma in that area.
[02:00:21.630 --> 02:00:27.532]  That there's nothing much other than the fact that it's unsightly doesn't mean much from a physical perspective.
[02:00:27.832 --> 02:00:33.534]  The more concerning thing to me and another possibility is that it actually represents a lymphoma.
[02:00:34.255 --> 02:00:36.475]  You have a lot of lymph nodes in the back of your neck.
[02:00:36.535 --> 02:00:39.957]  There are two huge chains of lymph nodes that go down the back of the neck.
[02:00:40.357 --> 02:00:50.964]   And if he has Lymph node involvement from, for example, lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, that could present and look very much like that.
[02:00:51.405 --> 02:00:53.166]  Again, not saying that's what it is.
[02:00:53.546 --> 02:00:54.647]  Haven't examined him.
[02:00:54.727 --> 02:00:57.249]  Know nothing about his medical history.
[02:00:57.669 --> 02:00:59.451]  Other than that, he's relatively young.
[02:00:59.511 --> 02:01:01.212]  Have had a stroke recently.
[02:01:01.232 --> 02:01:03.914]  He clearly isn't doing well physically.
[02:01:03.934 --> 02:01:09.078]  To listen to him talk, you recognize that he is suffering from something.
[02:01:09.458 --> 02:01:20.473]  But this mass on the back of his neck could be something as benign as a large lipoma or something far more significant like lymphadenopathy related to something like a lymphoma.
[02:01:23.777 --> 02:01:26.221]  Why are they running all these zombies for our office?
[02:01:28.504 --> 02:01:43.973]  I'll tell you, if this is the best we can do, 330 million people and these are our best choices, perhaps it's because nobody wants to work their salt, wants to go into politics anymore because it's such an ugly place.
[02:01:44.333 --> 02:01:48.015]  And with the amount of censorship and derision and cancel culture... That's right.
[02:01:48.035 --> 02:01:48.635]  Stay there, doctor.
[02:01:48.454 --> 02:01:58.154]   to go to break. I remember when I remember I remember when I lost my mind. That was something so pleasant about that
[02:01:58.154 --> 02:02:05.333]  place. Even your emotions have an echo in so much space.
[02:02:05.396 --> 02:02:10.119]  And when you're out there, without care, yeah I was out of touch.
[02:02:10.179 --> 02:02:13.060]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough.
[02:02:12.980 --> 02:02:28.980]  [Music]
[02:02:28.980 --> 02:02:36.050]   Three years ago, or two and a half years ago, I was amongst twelve people to become the most banned on the internet,
[02:02:36.050 --> 02:02:40.980]  including Louis Faircon and Paul Watson and Gab McGinnis.
[02:02:41.141 --> 02:02:52.426]  And they said because I questioned his cognitive ability and believed he'd had some type of aneurysm or something because he suddenly got a lot worse about two and a half years ago, they said Jones is the most banned there is.
[02:02:53.066 --> 02:02:54.267]  Well, I mean, you could see it then.
[02:02:55.166 --> 02:03:04.093]  So, Dr. Kelly Victory, everybody should check out your getter, all your work, earlycovidcare.org, at kellyvictoremd on getter.
[02:03:05.074 --> 02:03:08.476]  I want to hit the victory lap here, which is a sad victory lap.
[02:03:08.496 --> 02:03:11.759]  We've been vindicated on the COVID shots and more here in a moment in the time we have left.
[02:03:11.779 --> 02:03:28.254]   But just finishing up here, this is outrageous what's going on with Biden, and it just shows The wildness of the establishment to try to do something like this, and I don't see how they extricate themselves, as you said, with Kamala Harris in there.
[02:03:28.294 --> 02:03:37.605]  I mean, there's no way he makes it, no way he makes it on the trajectory he's on another two years into the general election.
[02:03:37.625 --> 02:03:38.406]  What do you think is going to happen?
[02:03:39.893 --> 02:03:41.174]  No, no, I agree with you.
[02:03:41.214 --> 02:03:54.462]  And as I was saying before the break, although the physical signs are very obvious to people, the way that he walks, the fact that he stumbles frequently, falls off a bike, those things are far less concerning to me.
[02:03:54.522 --> 02:03:58.484]  Let's face it, we had a president, a very effective one, in a wheelchair.
[02:03:58.544 --> 02:04:00.866]  We have sitting governors that are in a wheelchair.
[02:04:01.746 --> 02:04:10.331]  You don't need to be physically sound necessarily to be a good leader, but you sure as heck better have your faculties about you cognitively, and he doesn't.
[02:04:11.051 --> 02:04:21.677]  And this is only going to get worse, and it will get profoundly worse if his schedule is disrupted or if we have a national disaster, a crisis of any sort.
[02:04:21.917 --> 02:04:26.500]  Can you imagine if we had 9-11 and this was the president at the helm?
[02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:30.524]  Uh, so they're going to have to do something in my estimation, Alex.
[02:04:30.904 --> 02:04:35.109]  Either he's going to become a complete and total figurehead and we won't see him at all.
[02:04:35.429 --> 02:04:42.757]  He will just, quote, lead from his basement and we'll have them just march out a series of people to give his talking points.
[02:04:43.178 --> 02:04:47.963]  Or they're going to have to enact the 25th Amendment if he won't step down on his own.
[02:04:48.463 --> 02:04:59.568]  I suspect that he will clearly make the choice not to run again in 2024, citing likely his age and the fact that he's having some health issues.
[02:04:59.908 --> 02:05:03.230]  But what happens between now and then is unclear.
[02:05:03.610 --> 02:05:10.913]  If it were anybody other than Kamala Harris sitting in the VP position, we might have already had resolution to this disaster.
[02:05:11.673 --> 02:05:15.295]  She ended up being his greatest protector to keep him ensconced.
[02:05:15.795 --> 02:05:20.114]   in the White House. So it remains to be seen, but it isn't going to be pretty.
[02:05:20.114 --> 02:05:23.713]   Well, that's right. You wouldn't have somebody drive a school bus that had dementia or be a doctor
[02:05:23.713 --> 02:05:30.675]   or be an auto mechanic or run drawbridges. But we have this clear puppet in there. So I go back to
[02:05:30.675 --> 02:05:33.904]  the big question. Who is really the president right now?
[02:05:33.904 --> 02:05:35.795]  Who's really making the decisions?
[02:05:35.795 --> 02:05:39.395]   Because obviously Biden says, tell me what to do. I don't know where I am. Help me.
[02:05:39.395 --> 02:05:45.154]   I mean, this is a coup. It's a coup by bureaucracy having a vegetable as the president.
[02:05:46.114 --> 02:05:50.194]   Yeah, you're in as good a position to make that prediction as I am.
[02:05:50.338 --> 02:05:59.984]  I'm thinking it's probably a combination of Valerie Jarrett and Susan Rice, and God only knows who else is there making these decisions.
[02:06:00.024 --> 02:06:01.985]  Exactly, Obama functionaries.
[02:06:02.485 --> 02:06:02.865]  Obama.
[02:06:02.906 --> 02:06:04.466]  Yeah, it's not Joe Biden.
[02:06:05.547 --> 02:06:08.589]  So Obama is really getting his third term right now.
[02:06:10.309 --> 02:06:15.736]  Yeah, unfortunately, I think through his minions, absolutely, that that's the case.
[02:06:16.116 --> 02:06:17.758]  It clearly isn't Biden.
[02:06:17.838 --> 02:06:20.902]  He does not come up with an original thought.
[02:06:22.104 --> 02:06:22.884]  He really doesn't.
[02:06:22.925 --> 02:06:25.608]  He goes purely off the talking points that he's handed.
[02:06:25.988 --> 02:06:42.380]  And that's why they use the cane and they grab him off the stage as quickly as possible because I think their greatest fear is that he will go rogue, that all of a sudden he'll start speaking extemporaneously, either cogently or otherwise, and spill the beans.
[02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:45.462]  So, yeah, he clearly is being controlled.
[02:06:45.762 --> 02:06:49.605]  And when, you know, we've called other people, you know, puppets in the past.
[02:06:49.665 --> 02:06:51.407]  This has taken it to a new level.
[02:06:51.467 --> 02:07:03.437]  This is, you know, he is a puppet, you know, and that's on steroids because he simply doesn't have the cognitive ability to make these decisions or to come up with an assessment.
[02:07:04.037 --> 02:07:09.322]  So is it fair to say we have a near-vegetable puppet as the president right now?
[02:07:11.174 --> 02:07:13.536]  Unfortunately, I fear that that's the case.
[02:07:14.757 --> 02:07:18.720]  This was obvious well before the election ever took place.
[02:07:18.860 --> 02:07:19.961]  I predicted this.
[02:07:21.042 --> 02:07:22.824]  I look at this video that you're showing now.
[02:07:22.884 --> 02:07:23.784]  It's painful.
[02:07:25.145 --> 02:07:27.107]  He is absolutely lost.
[02:07:27.167 --> 02:07:28.148]  He's confused.
[02:07:28.188 --> 02:07:29.929]  He doesn't know which way to turn.
[02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:33.572]  These are horrible optics for our country.
[02:07:33.592 --> 02:07:42.246]   And there's no better video to show that Obama is enjoying his third presidency As they're all ignoring Biden while he just wanders around like a two-year-old.
[02:07:43.668 --> 02:07:43.908]  Right.
[02:07:44.128 --> 02:07:44.729]  Exactly.
[02:07:44.989 --> 02:07:48.033]  And they're over, you know, fawning on Obama.
[02:07:48.253 --> 02:07:56.243]  And no one's paying attention to the fact that the president, the sitting president, is dazed and confused.
[02:07:57.684 --> 02:07:58.866]  Shifting gears here.
[02:08:01.536 --> 02:08:06.417]  I mean, look, this is the same thing that happened two weeks ago where he wandered off from Obama and everybody was around Obama.
[02:08:06.758 --> 02:08:08.818]  And then Biden comes up and grabs him desperately.
[02:08:08.978 --> 02:08:10.199]  I mean, this is just flailing.
[02:08:11.279 --> 02:08:12.359]  We don't want to do a victory lap.
[02:08:12.399 --> 02:08:13.820]  We're very sad they launched the shot.
[02:08:13.880 --> 02:08:14.400]  It didn't work.
[02:08:14.460 --> 02:08:15.120]  It was poisonous.
[02:08:15.660 --> 02:08:23.102]  But Europe suffers horrifying 755% increase in excess deaths among children since EMA approved COVIDVax for kids.
[02:08:23.162 --> 02:08:24.063]  Infowars.com.
[02:08:24.583 --> 02:08:25.843]  And it links to mainline studies.
[02:08:26.603 --> 02:08:28.164]  And it continues there.
[02:08:29.372 --> 02:08:46.524]  Where they are now admitting with all these scientists and all these researchers dealing with COVID-19 that suspend all COVID-19 mRNA vaccines until side effects are fully investigated, says leading doctor who promised them on TV, who promoted them.
[02:08:47.144 --> 02:08:49.245]  Here's a bunch of other ones dealing with this.
[02:08:49.305 --> 02:08:51.067]  Rand Paul calls for criminal investigation.
[02:08:51.447 --> 02:08:54.709]  Canada suspends all forced injections.
[02:08:55.289 --> 02:08:59.492]   FDA vaccine advisor says healthy Young people should not take the shot.
[02:09:00.153 --> 02:09:01.994]  New York suspends forced injections.
[02:09:02.494 --> 02:09:04.275]  They are running away from this now.
[02:09:04.535 --> 02:09:11.020]  What do you make of the CDC head a month ago saying, oh, we were wrong, we lied to you, we knew it wouldn't work.
[02:09:11.100 --> 02:09:12.821]  I mean, what are they doing here?
[02:09:14.594 --> 02:09:20.656]  Well, first of all, unfortunately, they aren't doing the one thing they should be doing, Alex, which is pulling these immediately from the market.
[02:09:21.136 --> 02:09:29.158]  I am not anti-vaccine, but I have had grave concerns about these particular vaccines since before they were launched on the public.
[02:09:29.538 --> 02:09:30.759]  They are untested.
[02:09:30.779 --> 02:09:33.039]  They use brand new technology.
[02:09:33.159 --> 02:09:42.283]   They have a paucity of safety Data behind them and it was very clear within weeks of them being rolled out that there were devastating adverse events.
[02:09:42.683 --> 02:09:44.744]  The data are irrefutable.
[02:09:45.045 --> 02:09:53.929]  You are far more likely to suffer a severe adverse event from these vaccines than to be prevented from getting hospitalized with COVID.
[02:09:54.349 --> 02:10:03.693]  We've known from the very beginning that the vast majority of people are at a relatively low risk from COVID and that was back when we had the original Wuhan strain.
[02:10:04.273 --> 02:10:13.359]  Healthy young people have such a low risk of such a de minimis risk of having a severe outcome as to be essentially indistinguishable from zero.
[02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:22.946]  The data now that we have based on, you know, only because of the aggressive FOIA requests, we have access to Pfizer and Moderna's own safety data.
[02:10:23.757 --> 02:10:24.798]  Prior to the rollout.
[02:10:25.118 --> 02:10:35.647]  And it clearly shows that for every one hospitalization from COVID that was avoided, there were 4.3 serious adverse events.
[02:10:35.947 --> 02:10:42.152]  And those are defined as death, near death, hospitalization, or permanent disability.
[02:10:42.552 --> 02:10:50.837]   When you parse that same data to look at the risk-benefit analysis for people aging ages 18 through 29, in other words,
[02:10:50.837 --> 02:10:54.876]   young healthy military recruits, people in college, that sort of thing.
[02:10:54.876 --> 02:11:03.197]   For every one hospitalization that's prevented, there are up to 98 serious adverse events.
[02:11:03.197 --> 02:11:06.356]  These shots should have been pulled within weeks.
[02:11:07.078 --> 02:11:09.701]  And again, we're not victory lapping, but we've all been vindicated.
[02:11:09.782 --> 02:11:10.743]  Big Tech censored us.
[02:11:10.803 --> 02:11:11.644]  They knew what they were doing.
[02:11:12.024 --> 02:11:16.911]  Please join us again, not in three or four months, but next week if you'd like, to really just drill into all this.
[02:11:16.951 --> 02:11:18.673]  God bless you, and thank you so much.
[02:11:18.733 --> 02:11:21.857]  Everybody should visit your website right now, EarlyCovidCare.org.
[02:11:21.877 --> 02:11:22.338]  Thank you so much.
[02:11:25.848 --> 02:11:26.748]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:11:27.309 --> 02:11:27.669]  Thank you.
[02:11:27.809 --> 02:11:32.651]  All right, Diego, Chris, Jason, Travis, Laina, Daniel, Charles.

[02:11:39.733 --> 02:11:42.634]  But I'm going to take some of his time, he understands, to get to your calls.
[02:11:42.694 --> 02:11:44.415]  I promise to do it separately.
[02:11:44.855 --> 02:11:45.816]  Look, you want to keep us on air?
[02:11:45.856 --> 02:11:46.557]  It's your decision.
[02:11:46.597 --> 02:11:47.377]  We need your support.
[02:11:47.678 --> 02:11:48.739]  Plus, it's a piece of history.

[02:12:29.375 --> 02:12:30.856]  We're now into hour number four.
[02:12:31.117 --> 02:12:34.479]  Ahead of Gerald Cilente taking over in 15 minutes.
[02:12:34.539 --> 02:12:36.261]  Let's go right to your calls.
[02:12:37.001 --> 02:12:38.443]  Diego in Florida.
[02:12:38.463 --> 02:12:39.003]  Thanks for holding.
[02:12:40.304 --> 02:12:43.507]  Hey Alex, pleasure to speak to you.
[02:12:43.747 --> 02:12:44.968]  Very noble work you're doing.
[02:12:44.988 --> 02:12:45.729]  Thank you.
[02:12:46.529 --> 02:12:49.111]  Alex, just a touch base on Maloney.
[02:12:51.954 --> 02:12:57.078]  Her and Putin and the Hungarian Prime Minister are all on the same page.
[02:12:59.002 --> 02:13:04.204]  Nobody's agreeing with what's going on with the NWO.
[02:13:06.624 --> 02:13:06.944]  You know?
[02:13:08.365 --> 02:13:08.885]  No, you're right.
[02:13:08.925 --> 02:13:14.526]  She's big with the previous leader of Italy that was buddies with Putin.
[02:13:14.546 --> 02:13:17.207]  You're absolutely right that this is a big deal.
[02:13:17.787 --> 02:13:18.508]  What do you make of it?
[02:13:20.328 --> 02:13:23.529]  Well, I see that it's going to come across.
[02:13:23.569 --> 02:13:26.590]  I mean, with the energy situation and all.
[02:13:28.890 --> 02:13:34.593]  It's going to get to a point where pretty much every country is going to be backing her.
[02:13:35.054 --> 02:13:37.615]  As far as the EU, you know?
[02:13:39.376 --> 02:13:41.617]  Well yeah, the EU has threatened sanctions on Italy.
[02:13:43.178 --> 02:13:45.259]  The unelected EU is threatening voters.
[02:13:45.279 --> 02:13:46.680]  Think about how authoritarian that is.
[02:13:47.861 --> 02:13:48.941]  Yeah, that's pretty bad.
[02:13:52.723 --> 02:14:00.549]  I don't know if you heard that Germany said it's going to take over Putin's oil.
[02:14:00.889 --> 02:14:03.331]  I was like, what?
[02:14:04.852 --> 02:14:06.073]  Oh, this is real war, brother.
[02:14:06.893 --> 02:14:09.935]  I mean, we're in full war with Russia right now.
[02:14:09.955 --> 02:14:10.656]  It's so dangerous.
[02:14:11.687 --> 02:14:18.171]  You know, they say the closest time we ever came to war was actually during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[02:14:18.231 --> 02:14:18.752]  Actually not.
[02:14:18.792 --> 02:14:26.797]  The closest time we've ever been to war, in reality, in retrospect, was the 1967 attack on the USS Liberty.
[02:14:26.977 --> 02:14:31.680]  There was actually a Russian sub out there that was observing the attack.
[02:14:32.621 --> 02:14:39.325]  And they actually asked, you know, they were actually... Well, it wasn't a Russian sub, it was a Russian surveillance ship, yes.
[02:14:40.437 --> 02:14:43.998]  They said they were two minutes from actually nuking Israel.
[02:14:44.479 --> 02:14:45.179]  I was like, wow.
[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:53.802]  And they also had just the authorities out there and they had President Johnson call them back.
[02:14:54.282 --> 02:14:55.022]  That was nuts.
[02:14:55.422 --> 02:14:55.843]  That was nuts.
[02:14:56.143 --> 02:14:56.623]  But anyway.
[02:14:57.583 --> 02:14:59.024]  Well, God bless you, Brother Diego.
[02:14:59.044 --> 02:15:00.144]  Thanks for holding great points.
[02:15:00.664 --> 02:15:02.005]  Chris in New York, you're on the air.
[02:15:02.025 --> 02:15:02.325]  Welcome.
[02:15:03.359 --> 02:15:04.760]  Mr. Jones, how are you doing?
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:06.702]  Okay.
[02:15:07.122 --> 02:15:10.745]  I have two medical events that happened to me recently.
[02:15:10.765 --> 02:15:17.470]  I went to my primary doctor in New York City, and I asked him a lot of questions about six months ago about the vaccine.
[02:15:18.446 --> 02:15:23.927]  And he got very upset, and he wouldn't talk much about it, although he did admit one thing.
[02:15:24.327 --> 02:15:27.868]  He said there was graphene oxide in the vaccines.
[02:15:28.408 --> 02:15:29.289]  And how did he know that?
[02:15:29.329 --> 02:15:38.331]  Because he used to do research at Mount Sinai Hospital with cancer patients, and they used that for the cancer patients as a delivery system.
[02:15:38.751 --> 02:15:39.711]  So he admitted that.
[02:15:40.151 --> 02:15:41.532]  Okay, now to the second part.
[02:15:41.992 --> 02:16:00.041]   Just recently, I went to a specialist that doesn't know my regular doctor, the kidney specialist, And before I went to the doctor, I realized on the internet they said that the World Health Organization was trying to get exclusive rights to vaccinate everyone in the world.
[02:16:00.862 --> 02:16:08.006]  So, when I saw my doctor, I said, can the World Health Organization do this if they okay this treaty?
[02:16:08.887 --> 02:16:27.686]   And she told me, it's a lot worse than you think, and she told me that she got Notified by the federal, state, and local governments, health divisions, or whatever they are, the New York State Medical Board, or whatever, and the federal government, and the city government, that she can't talk about.
[02:16:28.787 --> 02:16:32.889]  Lists and lists and lists that she had on the screen, but I couldn't see them.
[02:16:33.090 --> 02:16:34.010]  They were too far away.
[02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:37.572]  She says, I can't print these out for you, but I have a gag order.
[02:16:38.093 --> 02:16:44.717]  I was threatened that if I talk about any of these subjects, including the vaccines, I will lose my license.
[02:16:45.603 --> 02:16:50.508]  And I think people should know this, and they should ask their doctors, is this true, and see what they say.
[02:16:50.568 --> 02:16:53.791]  Because, this is, I'm an independent.
[02:16:53.931 --> 02:16:55.053]  I don't go right or left.
[02:16:55.353 --> 02:16:56.334]  I go through the truth.
[02:16:56.914 --> 02:16:58.356]  Now, I learned it the hard way.
[02:16:59.377 --> 02:17:00.938]  And this isn't from hearsay.
[02:17:02.199 --> 02:17:04.921]  I hope this helps people realize what's really going on.
[02:17:04.981 --> 02:17:06.142]  It does help, Chris, yes.
[02:17:06.723 --> 02:17:13.969]  There is a medical tyranny they're bringing world government in via the medical system and they're telling doctors to be part of these UN protocols.
[02:17:14.329 --> 02:17:18.132]  They admit, mainstream news, the UN is in control of our health right now.
[02:17:18.193 --> 02:17:18.693]  It's official.
[02:17:19.053 --> 02:17:19.834]  That's actually public.
[02:17:20.234 --> 02:17:20.895]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:20.915 --> 02:17:21.275]  Stay with us.
[02:17:24.258 --> 02:17:27.040]  The front lines of the information war.
[02:17:27.660 --> 02:17:29.082]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:17:30.467 --> 02:17:35.934]  All right, Gerald Cilente takes over at T-minus 10 minutes, but I want to jam in as many of these callers as we can.
[02:17:35.954 --> 02:17:47.008]  A, we need to stay on air and have the funding, but B, just as important, my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is number one in the world right now.
[02:17:48.250 --> 02:17:49.211]  And we need to push it.
[02:17:50.630 --> 02:17:55.349]   to number one and keep it there for a long time. Get signed copies that are a fundraiser
[02:17:55.349 --> 02:18:00.200]  at infowarestore.com or get an unsigned copy at infowarestore.com.
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:04.549]   But we need support. We are so close to imploding. Please support us at
[02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:08.661]   infowarestore.com. We have to pay for our own bandwidth, our own infrastructure, our own
[02:18:08.661 --> 02:18:13.340]   lawyers, our own crew, and we're doing it, and they're so afraid of this model. So please keep us on
[02:18:13.340 --> 02:18:15.190]  air. Infowarestore.com.
[02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:15.670]  Welcome.
[02:18:15.690 --> 02:18:16.910]  I've been a listener for over 25 years.
[02:18:16.930 --> 02:18:19.051]  I moved down from Dayton, Ohio to Atlanta.
[02:18:18.951 --> 02:18:24.370]   1776coin.com for the limited edition Teddy Roosevelt fundraiser historic piece of art coin as well
[02:18:24.370 --> 02:18:29.652]   1776coin.com all right Charles in Atlanta Charles you're on the air go ahead
[02:18:29.652 --> 02:18:35.290]   Hey, what's up Alex welcome? I've been a listener for over 25 years
[02:18:35.290 --> 02:18:41.170]   I moved down from Dayton Ohio to Atlanta. I was listening to because I've been a freedom fighter
[02:18:41.170 --> 02:18:47.431]   Since I was 17 Spirit told me that the world was a matrix
[02:18:48.102 --> 02:19:00.450]  I began to have my eyes open, and when I got here, I listened to a black radio station that did a great job of balanced empowerment, intellectual empowerment to the black community.
[02:19:00.490 --> 02:19:02.992]  But somebody mentioned Infowars and Alex Jones.
[02:19:03.632 --> 02:19:09.536]  So I turned over at that time, about 23 years ago, listened to you, and I haven't went back the other way.
[02:19:09.996 --> 02:19:12.378]  That's not to say that black issues are not important.
[02:19:12.796 --> 02:19:24.544]  But the difference between a black issue, a Jewish issue, or a particular ethnicity's issue, it doesn't do what Infowars does and encompass humanity as a whole.
[02:19:25.244 --> 02:19:37.392]  And I always have said, until we go up to the 33,000 foot view and see that all of humanity is in the grip of something evil, we cannot fight this thing by just being black or just being this, that, and the other.
[02:19:40.507 --> 02:19:45.410]  A History Channel show of an African lion running after five or six deer.
[02:19:45.610 --> 02:19:50.934]  There was a Jesse Owens-type deer up front that he didn't try to bother to catch.
[02:19:50.954 --> 02:19:59.159]  He got the one in the rear with the lame leg so he could have the easiest lunch with less effort.
[02:19:59.799 --> 02:20:09.125]  I consider, and I've looked at this holistically, when so-called black people were brought over here and not allowed to speak our language, our religion.
[02:20:09.933 --> 02:20:15.256]  And so much knowledge was taken from us, and there was a different black, quote, black man put into our minds.
[02:20:16.337 --> 02:20:33.166]  The system has used black people in America, in my mind, as a tinderbox to enrich itself on the one hand, but in the modern world, like Black Lives Matter, to be an inflammatory fuel for racial strife.
[02:20:33.626 --> 02:20:37.519]   It's not the black Black skin is worse or white skin is better.
[02:20:37.539 --> 02:20:42.642]  It's just that the evil people know how to use the weakest minded and the weakest spiritual.
[02:20:43.402 --> 02:20:48.445]  Now, unfortunately, the black community in America has lost so much of its spirituality.
[02:20:48.505 --> 02:20:51.087]  We just don't go to church, believe in God like we used to.
[02:20:51.107 --> 02:20:53.128]  I'm not saying all, but a lot of us.
[02:20:53.608 --> 02:20:54.969]  The homes are broken down.
[02:20:55.249 --> 02:20:59.292]  Fathers are not in the home to take care, to lead these young black men.
[02:20:59.772 --> 02:21:01.393]  And the system has left drugs.
[02:21:01.832 --> 02:21:04.714]  Rap music and guns available to make chaos.
[02:21:05.155 --> 02:21:17.624]  The living conditions are really, you know, you don't want to live in a poverty-inflicted place so the mind is not at peace.
[02:21:18.085 --> 02:21:21.747]  Okay, let me jump real quick because I know you got other callers.
[02:21:22.108 --> 02:21:23.589]  I want to say something about Owen Schroyer.
[02:21:24.582 --> 02:21:29.405]  Over these years, he's come up to be a great Alex Jones, too, so to speak.
[02:21:29.745 --> 02:21:33.148]  He's really a wise young man, and I love the fact.
[02:21:33.208 --> 02:21:41.353]  Tell him to continue to talk boldly and honestly and truthfully, and as a Christian, about black issues.
[02:21:41.793 --> 02:21:43.954]  There should be no white man, and I agree with him.
[02:21:44.295 --> 02:21:49.998]  There should be no person on the earth that has any problem discussing issues that are outside their ethnicity.
[02:21:50.539 --> 02:21:53.060]  Don't let people say you're not black and you can't talk about it.
[02:21:53.100 --> 02:22:01.064]   He's a very balanced, We should all love our cultures and where we came from.
[02:22:01.104 --> 02:22:02.024]  They want to erase it all.
[02:22:02.405 --> 02:22:08.029]  So we all have our own issues, but then we come together against the globalists and the depopulation and the transhumanists.
[02:22:08.049 --> 02:22:09.790]  We all have real beefs and real issues.
[02:22:10.170 --> 02:22:13.252]  But at the end of the day, this new world order is going to end us all.
[02:22:13.713 --> 02:22:15.094]  So I want to thank you, Charles, for the call.
[02:22:15.154 --> 02:22:17.055]  God bless you, and I appreciate you.
[02:22:17.395 --> 02:22:19.297]  If we don't win together, we're going to lose.
[02:22:19.717 --> 02:22:23.240]  So we better wake up, and we better come together, and we better do it now.
[02:22:23.780 --> 02:22:24.281]  Bless you, sir.
[02:22:24.301 --> 02:22:25.162]  I appreciate your call.
[02:22:26.003 --> 02:22:26.684]  Powerful, boys.
[02:22:27.445 --> 02:22:28.486]  Travis in Connecticut.
[02:22:28.506 --> 02:22:28.987]  You're on the air.
[02:22:29.027 --> 02:22:32.331]  Go ahead.
[02:22:32.351 --> 02:22:32.931]  Hey, Alex.
[02:22:32.992 --> 02:22:33.993]  Long time listener.
[02:22:34.293 --> 02:22:34.774]  I love you, man.
[02:22:35.456 --> 02:22:40.039]  I'm starting a new job and I've been maneuvered to take the death jab.
[02:22:40.539 --> 02:22:43.761]  I tried to get a religious exemption but was denied.
[02:22:44.302 --> 02:22:46.183]  So I'm forced to taking the job.
[02:22:46.203 --> 02:22:51.246]  I want to know there's major liability lawsuits being filed and even New York stopped it for private businesses.
[02:22:51.286 --> 02:22:55.429]  So, let me ask, without saying the name, what type of job do you have?
[02:22:56.589 --> 02:23:11.741]   Well, I mean, so I guess my question is, you know, I'm I'm making the decision to actually do it just for this opportunity, but really, my real question is, I know that all vaccines are bad, but I have two questions for you, Alex.
[02:23:11.881 --> 02:23:16.322]  Is the J&J shot less harmful because it's not mRNA?
[02:23:16.442 --> 02:23:16.982]  No.
[02:23:17.842 --> 02:23:18.022]  No?
[02:23:18.202 --> 02:23:18.422]  Okay.
[02:23:18.742 --> 02:23:23.603]  And would taking ibuprofen right before the shot decrease the chance of any side effects?
[02:23:23.883 --> 02:23:31.436]   I am not a doctor, but I've interviewed hundreds of them, and the J&J is probably, If you gotta take one, take the Pfizer.
[02:23:31.876 --> 02:23:32.737]  Don't take the Moderna.
[02:23:32.777 --> 02:23:33.857]  It's three times stronger.
[02:23:33.877 --> 02:23:36.379]  It's the exact same injection, three times stronger.
[02:23:36.399 --> 02:23:38.280]  It's equivalent to four shots of Pfizer.
[02:23:38.780 --> 02:23:41.762]  So the Moderna shot is four shots of the Pfizer.
[02:23:43.183 --> 02:23:45.584]  So it's three times stronger, four times stronger depending on how you look at it.
[02:23:46.124 --> 02:23:50.747]  The J&J sends a virus in to reprogram the body to create the spike protein.
[02:23:51.127 --> 02:23:52.408]  In some studies, it's even worse.
[02:23:53.529 --> 02:23:55.570]  And so you're killing yourself to live.
[02:23:57.029 --> 02:23:59.551]  Already, the mandate in the military is being canceled.
[02:23:59.911 --> 02:24:01.652]  The mandate's being killed at public schools.
[02:24:01.692 --> 02:24:02.372]  It's a lie!
[02:24:03.013 --> 02:24:05.854]  And so, I'm telling you, your health is not worth what they're trying to do.
[02:24:06.555 --> 02:24:15.840]  And no, I'm not telling you what to do, but if I had to take it, which I wouldn't do, I'd take the Pfizer, because if it hasn't been refrigerated properly, it breaks down and doesn't do anything.
[02:24:16.541 --> 02:24:18.082]  So, uh, man.
[02:24:18.782 --> 02:24:19.662]  I mean, brother.
[02:24:21.664 --> 02:24:22.764]  I'm not telling you to take any of it.
[02:24:23.445 --> 02:24:25.386]  I'm telling you, the weakest one is the Pfizer.
[02:24:27.162 --> 02:24:32.706]  I mean, what type of job, brother?
[02:24:33.426 --> 02:24:35.548]  It's not worth it, wants you to take this shot.
[02:24:35.728 --> 02:24:36.028]  Come on.
[02:24:36.548 --> 02:24:38.229]  And once you give in to this, you'll give in to anything.
[02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:39.510]  I know.
[02:24:40.471 --> 02:24:40.731]  I know.
[02:24:40.891 --> 02:24:42.172]  Well, give me a ballpark idea.
[02:24:42.212 --> 02:24:43.493]  Is it a medical job, or what is it?
[02:24:44.233 --> 02:24:44.673]  No, no.
[02:24:45.214 --> 02:24:50.497]  It's a substantial increase in pay, but it's just... I know.
[02:24:50.537 --> 02:24:52.398]  I'm curious what type of place wants you to do this.
[02:24:52.758 --> 02:24:54.179]  Look, nobody knows who you are.
[02:24:54.199 --> 02:24:55.400]  I'm asking, what kind of job is it?
[02:24:57.647 --> 02:25:01.768]  It's for sales, but it's an increase in pay.
[02:25:01.829 --> 02:25:02.809]  It's a good opportunity.
[02:25:02.869 --> 02:25:04.809]  I mean, I could say no and wait out.
[02:25:05.029 --> 02:25:09.571]  Yeah, but you've seen the New York Mayor go, get a free hamburger, get a donut.
[02:25:09.671 --> 02:25:12.752]  Man, dude, it's like cheese on a mousetrap.
[02:25:13.732 --> 02:25:14.372]  Right, I know.
[02:25:14.592 --> 02:25:17.633]  Now, if you think you can get the cheese off without getting killed, do it.
[02:25:17.673 --> 02:25:19.314]  But man, come on, brother.
[02:25:19.374 --> 02:25:19.854]  God bless you.
[02:25:19.874 --> 02:25:20.534]  I appreciate your call.
[02:25:22.193 --> 02:25:23.554]  That's the social credit score, though.
[02:25:23.994 --> 02:25:27.998]  Take an experimental, unauthorized shot, killed a bunch of people, because they're offering you money.
[02:25:28.358 --> 02:25:30.319]  What type of people are these?
[02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:31.821]  God Almighty!
[02:25:31.841 --> 02:25:37.125]  All right, I'm sorry to Thomas and Daniel and Lena and Jason.
[02:25:37.205 --> 02:25:39.127]  Get their numbers, John, and remind me tomorrow.
[02:25:39.287 --> 02:25:41.789]  If they want to give us their numbers, we'll call them back, we'll put them on.
[02:25:41.809 --> 02:25:47.853]  But Gerald Cilente's got so much to cover, I want to eat my lunch and listen to this great American, the top trends forecaster, coming up here.
[02:25:47.894 --> 02:25:48.554]  There he is on screen.
[02:25:48.574 --> 02:25:49.555]  Let's bunch up Gerald Cilente.
[02:25:50.629 --> 02:25:51.809]  Hello there, Alex.
[02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.490]  There he is.
[02:25:52.530 --> 02:25:53.730]  Gerald, what do you got coming up?
[02:25:54.891 --> 02:25:57.191]  Well, you know, what's going on in the economy?
[02:25:57.492 --> 02:26:00.473]  And World War III has begun.
[02:26:00.833 --> 02:26:04.394]  And we just heard this guy, Jake Sullivan.
[02:26:04.954 --> 02:26:06.655]  Boy, you look at that cat, man.
[02:26:07.095 --> 02:26:09.096]  Looks like he's related to Goebbels.
[02:26:09.696 --> 02:26:14.498]  When you heard him on CBS and Meet the Prestitutes on Sunday.
[02:26:15.288 --> 02:26:24.973]  Saying that if Russia, you know, uses any kind of nuclear weapons or if they get more aggressive, the United States will respond and on and on and on.
[02:26:25.714 --> 02:26:40.902]  I mean, this is... You know, look, Alex, if you hated somebody and you got a crime syndicate and you're giving them all the weapons they want to go kill somebody else, it's your war.
[02:26:41.362 --> 02:26:43.443]  The United States is at war with Russia.
[02:26:44.358 --> 02:26:47.280]  We are on the cusp of a nuclear war.
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:49.422]  I totally agree.
[02:26:49.442 --> 02:26:52.444]  This is five times more dangerous than the Cuban Missile Crisis in my view.
[02:26:52.844 --> 02:26:54.145]  Gerald Cilente takes over.
[02:26:54.285 --> 02:26:56.107]  Everybody stay with us and share the link.
[02:26:56.127 --> 02:26:57.488]  This is a war of information.
[02:26:57.508 --> 02:26:59.149]  You are who they hate.
[02:27:03.192 --> 02:27:07.375]  That's why they want the show shut down, because you can take action and you can override their A.I.
[02:27:07.416 --> 02:27:07.976]  and censorship.
[02:27:08.236 --> 02:27:08.877]  So let's do it.
[02:27:08.937 --> 02:27:12.219]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[02:27:12.620 --> 02:27:14.141]  Share the links now to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:14.161 --> 02:27:18.064]  And then, in 45 minutes, Owen Schroyer and the War Room takes over.
[02:27:18.404 --> 02:27:19.385]  Infowars.com.
[02:27:19.224 --> 02:27:34.384]  Tom, tomorrow's news today.
[02:27:34.384 --> 02:27:43.528]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[02:27:44.688 --> 02:27:48.290]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:54.032]  And one of the callers before about religious vaccine exemptions.
[02:27:55.173 --> 02:28:00.275]  Universal Church of Freedom, Peace and Justice provides vaccine exemptions.
[02:28:00.959 --> 02:28:03.460]  And they've been over 99% effective.
[02:28:04.221 --> 02:28:12.906]  And you can go to FreedomPeaceJustice.com FreedomPeaceJustice.com to get one.
[02:28:13.646 --> 02:28:15.907]  And a constitutional lawyer put this together.
[02:28:16.468 --> 02:28:22.571]  The only way that they could reject this is if they don't accept religious vaccine exemption.
[02:28:23.432 --> 02:28:31.518]   Otherwise, unless you have, you know, somebody from the White House running the show, They can't reject it.
[02:28:32.099 --> 02:28:36.600]  Anyway, I mentioned to Alex, you know, what am I going to be talking about?
[02:28:36.620 --> 02:28:42.922]  We're going to talk a lot about the economy because we're going into the worst financial crisis in human history.
[02:28:43.723 --> 02:28:50.125]  This thing, this whole economy around the world was artificially propped up to fight the COVID war.
[02:28:50.525 --> 02:28:52.085]  We're fighting the COVID war.
[02:28:52.506 --> 02:28:53.646]  We're giving you free money.
[02:28:53.706 --> 02:28:57.787]  We're locking down your business and destroying you across the globe.
[02:28:58.188 --> 02:28:59.488]  But that's a whole other story.
[02:29:00.467 --> 02:29:03.870]  And now you're seeing it with interest rates just going up a little bit.
[02:29:04.470 --> 02:29:09.094]  What do you have, a 3.25 Fed rate when you have inflation running at 8.5%?
[02:29:11.116 --> 02:29:15.139]  And Clown Boy Powell, the Fed head, saying it was only temporary, transitory.
[02:29:15.159 --> 02:29:19.102]  And then today's woke world, transgender-tory inflation.
[02:29:20.123 --> 02:29:21.244]  Let's really be stupid.
[02:29:22.465 --> 02:29:28.910]  But going on to the... My greatest concern right now is the Ukraine war.
[02:29:29.827 --> 02:29:36.333]  And again, I'm totally opposed to Russia's invasion, but I totally understand why they invaded.
[02:29:37.954 --> 02:29:42.858]  And there was an article that just came up.
[02:29:43.318 --> 02:29:44.640]  The Guardian actually put it out.
[02:29:45.620 --> 02:29:46.441]  It was eight years ago.
[02:29:46.461 --> 02:29:48.743]  In Ukraine, the U.S.
[02:29:48.803 --> 02:29:50.785]  is dragging us toward war with Russia.
[02:29:50.805 --> 02:29:53.767]  And this is by John Pilger.
[02:29:53.787 --> 02:30:02.364]   It goes on and begins that Why do we tolerate the threat of another world war in our name?
[02:30:02.984 --> 02:30:05.606]  Why do we allow lies to justify these risks?
[02:30:06.607 --> 02:30:21.417]  The scale of our indoctrination, wrote Harold Pinter, is a brilliant, even witty, highly successful act of hypnosis, as if the truth, quote, never happened, even while it was happening.
[02:30:23.157 --> 02:30:33.317]   And then Pilger goes on to write, remember this is 2014, May, spring.
[02:30:33.317 --> 02:30:41.237]   Washington's role in Ukraine is different only in its implications for the rest of us.
[02:30:41.401 --> 02:30:44.763]  For the first time since the Reagan years, the U.S.
[02:30:44.843 --> 02:30:58.129]   is threatening to take the world to war with Eastern Europe and the Balkans, now military outposts of NATO, the last buffer state bordering Russia Ukraine is being torn apart.
[02:30:58.169 --> 02:30:58.529]  You ready?
[02:30:59.350 --> 02:31:04.373]  By fascist forces unleashed by the US and the EU.
[02:31:05.674 --> 02:31:15.920]  We in the West are now backing neo-Nazis in a country where Ukrainian Nazis back Hitler.
[02:31:16.960 --> 02:31:17.500]  That's right.
[02:31:18.701 --> 02:31:17.500]  2014.
[02:31:18.781 --> 02:31:20.602]  You ready?
[02:31:23.864 --> 02:31:25.005]  Here's your Trends Journal.
[02:31:26.681 --> 02:31:28.022]  This is when it used to be a quarterly.
[02:31:28.662 --> 02:31:29.463]  Spring edition.
[02:31:31.184 --> 02:31:35.767]  Washington is driving the world to the final war.
[02:31:36.467 --> 02:31:42.051]  World hegemony is not a right America has earned.
[02:31:44.472 --> 02:31:54.999]  This fellow, Pilgrim, mentioned what was going on in Ukraine back then.
[02:31:57.228 --> 02:31:59.909]  And about the overthrow of the government.
[02:32:01.709 --> 02:32:05.170]  And the Reagan administration, the worst time since the Reagan administration.
[02:32:06.271 --> 02:32:17.654]  This article was written for the Trends Journal by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former Assistant Treasury Secretary under Reagan.
[02:32:20.434 --> 02:32:27.211]   He goes on to say, Washington concluded that Russia needed to be confronted with We're distracted.
[02:32:27.812 --> 02:32:35.034]  Problems that would leave the Russian government less confident were able to counter Washington's aggression elsewhere.
[02:32:35.054 --> 02:32:41.317]  Ukraine presented the perfect opportunity for Washington to advance its hegemonic agenda.
[02:32:42.537 --> 02:33:10.219]   In a speech at the National Press Conference, club rather, in December 2013, he said, last December, and I want to give you, because anybody can look this up, It's December 2013, as by Victoria Nuland, at that time Obama, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, the murderer who's quoted in the book Double Down as saying, I'm really good at killing people.
[02:33:10.699 --> 02:33:30.359]   Yeah, that Assistant Secretary of State, Victoria Nuland, boasted that Washington had invested $5 billion In NGOs, non-governmental organizations, in Ukraine, the purpose of the NGOs is, quote, you ready?
[02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:38.943]  To teach democracy.
[02:33:38.963 --> 02:33:41.685]  Isn't that great?
[02:33:44.326 --> 02:33:45.727]  One after another.
[02:33:47.007 --> 02:33:48.248]  One after another.
[02:33:53.109 --> 02:33:56.992]  We are at war with Ukraine.
[02:33:58.773 --> 02:34:06.098]  Again, if I hired, again, you see how the United States fronted this whole operation.
[02:34:08.860 --> 02:34:22.690]  So, we're giving monies to the neo-Nazis to continue to wage their war against Russia.
[02:34:24.875 --> 02:34:33.683]  So if you're giving money to the neo-Nazis to wage the war, they're waging your war.
[02:34:34.764 --> 02:34:37.947]  We are at war with Russia.
[02:34:38.987 --> 02:34:43.131]  And Russia is now saying it piece by piece.
[02:34:44.672 --> 02:34:48.356]  This isn't the Iraq war where it's a third world country.
[02:34:48.836 --> 02:34:51.919]  This is an Afghan, a third, third world country.
[02:34:52.594 --> 02:34:58.437]  This isn't little Syria or Libya that the United States and NATO destroyed.
[02:34:58.457 --> 02:35:03.540]  I don't think NATO was in Syria, the United States.
[02:35:04.941 --> 02:35:06.121]  But definitely Libya.
[02:35:06.141 --> 02:35:09.523]  These are the Russians.
[02:35:11.564 --> 02:35:13.165]  And they're not going to succumb to this.
[02:35:14.686 --> 02:35:21.690]  And they're saying that if they're attacked, they will use any weapons that they need to defend themselves.
[02:35:24.250 --> 02:35:26.311]  World War III has begun.
[02:35:26.331 --> 02:35:31.494]  And if we don't stop it, it's going to be hell on earth.
[02:35:33.856 --> 02:35:34.916]  The Great Reset?
[02:35:34.936 --> 02:35:36.978]  Forget about it.
[02:35:38.839 --> 02:35:42.481]  Oh, and the imbeciles and morons that are building bomb shelters?
[02:35:44.182 --> 02:35:45.123]  Oh yeah, that's great.
[02:35:45.423 --> 02:35:52.387]  Oh, you're going to want to be alive after nuclear bombs blow up the world and it's hell on earth.
[02:35:52.868 --> 02:35:57.511]  Oh yeah, but you'll have your sauna down in your billionaire's bomb shelter.
[02:35:59.512 --> 02:36:00.653]  We're going to be right back.
[02:36:01.132 --> 02:36:08.132]   You better do all you can to support the truth, support InfoWise, and support peace.
[02:36:08.132 --> 02:36:18.132]  [music]
[02:36:18.132 --> 02:36:22.132]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:36:22.368 --> 02:36:25.891]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente!
[02:36:25.931 --> 02:36:31.675]  Hey, great being on The Alex Jones Show!
[02:36:31.835 --> 02:36:33.397]  And again, everybody listening.
[02:36:34.718 --> 02:36:37.620]  We have to unite.
[02:36:39.602 --> 02:36:41.203]  Most people don't know what's going on.
[02:36:41.223 --> 02:36:44.886]  I mean, they know, you know, what the Mets and the Yankees did.
[02:36:45.509 --> 02:36:46.389]  You know, this weekend.
[02:36:46.429 --> 02:36:48.770]  But they don't have a clue what's going on in the world.
[02:36:49.950 --> 02:36:53.291]  And InfoWars is doing their best and they got a great team of people.
[02:36:53.751 --> 02:36:55.492]  The articles that they put up every day.
[02:36:56.192 --> 02:36:57.692]  And they're giving you all they can.
[02:36:57.812 --> 02:37:00.033]  So you give them all you can.
[02:37:00.893 --> 02:37:03.054]  Because they want to blacklist us all.
[02:37:03.934 --> 02:37:08.536]  And again, we're doing all we can with the Trends Journal as well.
[02:37:09.116 --> 02:37:12.457]  But if we don't unite and work together, what are we talking about?
[02:37:13.317 --> 02:37:13.557]  You know.
[02:37:14.455 --> 02:37:20.177]  A couple of drinks, you know, you go out and I mean, you know, donate that money, you know, buy stuff from InfoWars.
[02:37:21.298 --> 02:37:24.219]  Go to Occupy Peace, subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[02:37:24.239 --> 02:37:30.821]  But you better do something because if we don't, if we don't fight for our freedom, we're going to die in war.
[02:37:31.702 --> 02:37:59.973]   I mentioned the articles about warning what was going on with the United States overthrow of the democratically elected government, the Vicky Yanukovych In 2014 in the Trends Journal, the article by Pilger about him saying, and it was in the Guardian actually, that the 2014 overthrows of Ukraine by the United States is bringing us to war.
[02:37:59.932 --> 02:38:08.732]   and 14 overthrows of Ukraine by the United States was bringing us to war.
[02:38:08.732 --> 02:38:23.852]   And we also heard this past weekend from Lavrov, that's Russia's
[02:38:27.852 --> 02:38:34.092]  foreign minister, who I actually met.
[02:38:33.795 --> 02:38:55.462]   He said, Ukraine descended into chaos in late 2013 after Viktor Yanukovych's government reversed course On pending an association agreement with Eastern Union, European Union, in favor of integration with the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union instead.
[02:38:56.502 --> 02:39:06.884]  In February of 2014, Ukrainian president was overthrown in a U.S.-sponsored coup, sparking the present security crisis.
[02:39:09.145 --> 02:39:14.994]   Quote, As I understand it, this is at his talk last week at the United Nations, Lvov.
[02:39:16.234 --> 02:39:24.779]  Today's meeting was motivated by the desire of some delegations to discuss the subject of lawlessness, impunity in Ukraine.
[02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:35.885]  I think it's very, very timely because this time lawlessness, impunity reflects what has been happening in this country since 2014, Lvov said.
[02:39:38.888 --> 02:39:46.993]  For more than eight years, the Ukrainian army and nationalist militant formations have been killing the inhabitants of the Donbass with impunity.
[02:39:47.013 --> 02:39:49.655]  In fact, they've killed over 14,000 of them.
[02:39:50.475 --> 02:39:56.679]  Only because they refused to recognize the results of the criminal, bloody, anti-constitutional coup in Kiev.
[02:39:57.620 --> 02:40:07.226]  Because they decided to defend rights guaranteed to them under the Ukrainian Constitution, including the right to freely use their native Russian tongue.
[02:40:11.024 --> 02:40:17.390]  Again, exactly what he said, we wrote in this Trends Journal back in 2014.
[02:40:17.730 --> 02:40:19.972]  Here's what happened.
[02:40:21.514 --> 02:40:25.177]  Ukraine has been broke since the breakup of the Soviet Union.
[02:40:26.658 --> 02:40:35.526]  Not according to me, but according to the European Union, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe.
[02:40:36.571 --> 02:40:56.178]  Run by oligarchs, who the comedian who played the piano with his penis on a sitcom, Vladimir Zelinsky, and then became actually became the president of Ukraine, said he was going to do away with the oligarchs.
[02:40:56.619 --> 02:41:00.400]  And that's one of the reasons why he got elected and he joined the club.
[02:41:02.742 --> 02:41:08.226]  So going on, this was all in front of everybody's eye.
[02:41:08.846 --> 02:41:09.967]  So here was the deal.
[02:41:09.987 --> 02:41:20.354]  Yanukovych made a deal with the IMF, the International Mafia, oh excuse me, Monetary Fund, and the EU.
[02:41:21.035 --> 02:41:21.855]  They needed money.
[02:41:23.657 --> 02:41:25.458]  Putin said, I got a better deal for you.
[02:41:27.395 --> 02:41:33.456]  I'll give you a lower interest rates and I'm going to cut your prices of oil and gas.
[02:41:34.737 --> 02:41:36.277]  Okay, we'll go with you.
[02:41:37.437 --> 02:41:38.237]  No, you won't!
[02:41:40.958 --> 02:41:42.538]  And that's when they overthrew the government.
[02:41:46.319 --> 02:41:48.739]  As I said, they're leading us to war.
[02:41:51.179 --> 02:42:03.739]   this past Sunday on "Meet the Prestitutes" or excuse me "Meet the Press."
[02:42:03.739 --> 02:42:13.738]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:42:04.871 --> 02:42:20.744]  This guy, our National Security Advisor, when you look at this cat, man, it looks like Goebbels could have been his grandson or something like that, man.
[02:42:20.764 --> 02:42:21.985]  This cat looks just like him.
[02:42:22.005 --> 02:42:23.506]  It's Jake Sullivan.
[02:42:25.608 --> 02:42:25.768]  Yep.
[02:42:28.874 --> 02:42:52.128]  He says to Chuck Todd, or is it Toad, I don't know, on Meet the Prestitutes, that Putin remains intent, quote, on wiping out the Ukrainian people and does not believe that Ukraine should have a right to exist.
[02:42:53.469 --> 02:42:53.949]  Wow.
[02:42:55.350 --> 02:42:57.191]  And people swallow that BS.
[02:42:57.291 --> 02:42:58.552]  Putin's never said that.
[02:43:00.913 --> 02:43:07.597]  That he does not, that he wants to wipe out the Ukrainian people?
[02:43:10.538 --> 02:43:11.659]  That's a total lie!
[02:43:14.981 --> 02:43:19.123]  Just like Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al-Qaeda.
[02:43:19.623 --> 02:43:20.704]  But the people believed it.
[02:43:22.304 --> 02:43:24.626]  Just like the Gulf of Tonkin incident.
[02:43:25.526 --> 02:43:26.327]  That never happened.
[02:43:29.401 --> 02:43:46.129]  Robert McNamara, an arrogant, arrogant, may he rot in hell, dirty SOB, lied about and admitted, I wrote it in my book, Trends 2000, because after he died, it came out.
[02:43:49.931 --> 02:43:55.594]  The Gulf of Tonkin incident in Vietnam never happened, but the people swallowed the crap.
[02:43:57.228 --> 02:44:05.548]   Just like they're swallowing the crap being shoveled out by this little Sullivan boy.
[02:44:05.548 --> 02:44:10.608]  Yep.
[02:44:10.608 --> 02:44:20.608]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:44:12.996 --> 02:44:14.457]  So he's gonna keep coming.
[02:44:15.537 --> 02:44:35.107]   And we have to keep coming with weapons, ammunition, intelligence, And all the support we can provide to the Ukrainians as they defend their land, their freedom, their democracy!
[02:44:35.127 --> 02:44:36.147]  Heil!
[02:44:36.567 --> 02:44:39.268]  Heil, little Jakey Sullivan!
[02:44:41.728 --> 02:44:43.088]  Listen to this crap!
[02:44:44.829 --> 02:44:46.529]  Oh, defend their democracy?
[02:44:46.549 --> 02:44:48.329]  Oh, like in Iraq?
[02:44:48.429 --> 02:44:49.029]  No, no!
[02:44:49.589 --> 02:44:52.730]  I know, like the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner!
[02:44:53.450 --> 02:44:54.770]  Barack Obama!
[02:44:56.891 --> 02:44:58.572]  Gaddafi has to go!
[02:44:59.112 --> 02:45:02.293]  We gotta bring freedom and democracy there!
[02:45:02.313 --> 02:45:07.094]  Oh, I forgot about Nicaragua, and then it was Haiti.
[02:45:08.275 --> 02:45:10.015]  Oh, Chile, where else?
[02:45:10.356 --> 02:45:10.716]  Yeah.
[02:45:12.956 --> 02:45:14.297]  One country after another.
[02:45:16.257 --> 02:45:17.778]  Bringing freedom and democracy.
[02:45:19.821 --> 02:45:22.182]  We have no right being in Ukraine!
[02:45:22.562 --> 02:45:23.863]  Ain't my business!
[02:45:26.724 --> 02:45:27.044]  None of it!
[02:45:28.204 --> 02:45:29.425]  I am an American!
[02:45:29.445 --> 02:45:31.166]  A little Jakey!
[02:45:32.246 --> 02:45:33.947]  You're gonna go listen to him.
[02:45:34.867 --> 02:45:36.608]  He's going to do what he said.
[02:45:36.628 --> 02:45:47.252]  We're gonna do everything we can by bringing weapons, ammunition, intelligence, and all the support we can provide.
[02:45:48.027 --> 02:45:50.150]  Listen, why don't you go lead the charge?
[02:45:50.851 --> 02:45:53.975]  Dress up in your military costume and go fight!
[02:45:54.555 --> 02:45:56.555]  Anybody that wants to go.
[02:45:56.555 --> 02:45:58.894]  (sad music)
[02:45:58.894 --> 02:46:15.754]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:46:15.754 --> 02:46:17.555]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:46:17.898 --> 02:46:21.781]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[02:46:24.764 --> 02:46:30.868]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show and, you know, we're in perilous times.
[02:46:30.948 --> 02:46:31.709]  This is unpredictable.
[02:46:31.849 --> 02:46:33.770]  I'm not a young cat, man.
[02:46:34.691 --> 02:46:37.293]  And there's nothing like this in my life.
[02:46:37.413 --> 02:46:39.014]  I'm born right after World War II.
[02:46:40.455 --> 02:46:42.977]  And I see how this country is declining in the world.
[02:46:43.057 --> 02:46:46.459]  And as I'm mentioning this stuff and I'm reading, I'm making it up.
[02:46:47.180 --> 02:46:49.141]  You know, we're on the brink of World War III.
[02:46:49.902 --> 02:46:52.724]  And the Great Reset, they're getting us from all different directions.
[02:46:53.482 --> 02:46:55.423]  So do what you can to support InfoWars.

[02:48:31.663 --> 02:48:35.824]  And again, you know, we're doing everything we can as well with our Trends Journal magazine.
[02:48:36.445 --> 02:48:38.305]  Last week was 170 pages.
[02:48:38.325 --> 02:48:40.106]  I can't read 170.
[02:48:40.166 --> 02:48:44.387]  You read what you want, you know, but we're giving you information, not getting anywhere else in the world.
[02:48:44.747 --> 02:48:47.728]  We tell you what's going on, what to do and what's next.
[02:48:48.508 --> 02:48:50.809]  Again, on the what to do line, think for yourself.
[02:48:50.869 --> 02:48:51.969]  We don't tell you what to do.
[02:48:52.369 --> 02:48:55.170]  We're telling you where it's going and what the trend forecast.
[02:48:56.350 --> 02:48:58.751]  I want to go back to this guy, Jake Sullivan.
[02:48:59.985 --> 02:49:03.588]  Who's on Meet the Prestitutes on Sunday with Chuck Code.
[02:49:05.870 --> 02:49:07.391]  Let me say this plainly, he said.
[02:49:08.292 --> 02:49:13.515]  If Russia crosses the line, there will be catastrophic consequences for Russia.
[02:49:14.336 --> 02:49:14.676]  You ready?
[02:49:14.696 --> 02:49:18.819]  The United States will respond decisively.
[02:49:18.839 --> 02:49:22.822]  Yep.
[02:49:26.085 --> 02:49:26.245]  Yep.
[02:49:28.831 --> 02:49:38.415]  The United States will respond decisively.
[02:49:39.795 --> 02:49:40.335]  Isn't that nice?
[02:49:40.355 --> 02:49:45.618]  Yep.
[02:49:46.698 --> 02:49:57.022]  Russia understands very well that the United States would do in response to use their nuclear weapons in Ukraine because we have spelled it out to them and we will leave it at that.
[02:49:57.898 --> 02:49:59.899]  We're going to leave it at that today.
[02:50:00.399 --> 02:50:01.960]  We'll respond decisively.
[02:50:02.780 --> 02:50:05.740]   From our perspective, we will continue to be sharp and clear.
[02:50:05.740 --> 02:50:19.659]   He goes on to say, you know, anyway, you can see what he's saying.
[02:50:19.930 --> 02:50:22.051]  We will respond decisively.
[02:50:22.211 --> 02:50:24.072]  We are going to war against Russia.
[02:50:26.273 --> 02:50:31.918]   So that means It's basically the end of life on Earth if we go to war
[02:50:31.717 --> 02:50:32.717]  war against Russia.
[02:50:32.717 --> 02:50:39.436]  All right.
[02:50:39.436 --> 02:50:42.117]   Before we wrap it up, I want to talk a little bit about the economy.
[02:50:42.144 --> 02:50:45.425]  When I went on the air, the Dow was down about 260 points.
[02:50:46.266 --> 02:50:47.486]  Gold is taking a beating.
[02:50:48.127 --> 02:50:50.147]  I would have never thought it was gone down this low.
[02:50:50.207 --> 02:50:57.150]  Why would anybody not want to have gold, which is the ultimate safe haven asset, in a time like this?
[02:50:58.660 --> 02:51:01.281]  But again, the game is rigged, and I'm not making that up.
[02:51:01.341 --> 02:51:08.464]  JPMorgan Chase was flying $900 million in 2019 for rigging the precious metals market.
[02:51:11.065 --> 02:51:13.446]  You're looking at copper prices going down.
[02:51:13.506 --> 02:51:14.207]  Very important.
[02:51:14.227 --> 02:51:15.607]  It's called Dr. Copper.
[02:51:16.368 --> 02:51:20.269]  Because as goes copper, copper is used in everything from heavy industry to high tech.
[02:51:21.149 --> 02:51:22.510]  You're seeing a lot less use.
[02:51:22.510 --> 02:51:36.509]   You saw the British sterling hit an all-time low against the dollar.
[02:51:36.725 --> 02:51:38.447]  An all-time low.
[02:51:39.167 --> 02:51:47.573]  Even worse than World War I and World War II as the UK was going down.
[02:51:50.655 --> 02:51:54.758]  The only reason the dollar is strong is because all the other economies are so weak.
[02:51:58.231 --> 02:52:00.893]  The Japanese Yen at a 24-year low.
[02:52:05.836 --> 02:52:11.679]  You're looking at inflation rates at, you know, 80% like in Argentina.
[02:52:14.721 --> 02:52:17.263]  It's off the charts what's going on.
[02:52:19.244 --> 02:52:21.925]  And today, you ready for this?
[02:52:22.966 --> 02:52:27.949]  Europe is facing lower than expected economic growth as inflation continues to climb.
[02:52:29.735 --> 02:52:57.795]  Speaking before the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs today, the head of the Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, former head of the IMF, the International Monetary Fund, and then head of that bank, warned today that, quote, economic consequences for the euro area over Russia's unjustified war of aggression on Ukraine.
[02:52:58.976 --> 02:53:00.677]  A spiral further since June.
[02:53:01.577 --> 02:53:02.738]  The outlook is darkening.
[02:53:06.840 --> 02:53:08.441]  Let's go back to Lagarde.
[02:53:11.162 --> 02:53:17.985]  This is the person that said that there was no inflation when inflation was skyrocketing in Europe.
[02:53:18.225 --> 02:53:18.365]  It's 9.1%.
[02:53:22.554 --> 02:53:36.403]  The interest rate in Europe is only 0.75% and they had negative interest rates, negative interest rates, so that bigs could buy up everything for eight years.
[02:53:40.145 --> 02:53:41.426]  And what does she say here?
[02:53:43.867 --> 02:53:50.892]  The problems of economic consequences for the euro area because of the, quote, unjustified war of aggression on Ukraine.
[02:53:52.085 --> 02:53:57.789]  Hey, how about, how about NATO's unjustified war of aggression on Yugoslavia?
[02:53:58.329 --> 02:54:01.451]  Kosovo, oh you forgot those, oh Kosovo, I forgot, oh yeah.
[02:54:01.911 --> 02:54:05.774]  How about, how about NATO's unjustified war against Libya?
[02:54:05.794 --> 02:54:07.034]  Oh, that's different, Celenti.
[02:54:08.135 --> 02:54:11.797]  Oh, and you're blaming Russia for the inflation?
[02:54:13.298 --> 02:54:17.501]  This is the crap, the garbage that they spew out of their mouths.
[02:54:18.886 --> 02:54:22.749]  You're the ones that put the sanctions on Russia.
[02:54:24.170 --> 02:54:28.714]  You're the ones that made the inflation happen.
[02:54:31.556 --> 02:54:42.565]  You're the ones that stopped the gas and oil flowing in, of which 40% goes into Europe, that used to go into Europe, from Russia.
[02:54:45.327 --> 02:55:01.196]   You're the ones that caused this problem By feeding weapons of death to keep bloodying the killing fields of the Ukraine war.
[02:55:02.677 --> 02:55:03.617]  You made it happen.
[02:55:07.439 --> 02:55:10.820]  Over a hundred thousand businesses, you know which ones?
[02:55:11.541 --> 02:55:16.963]  Small and medium-sized businesses in Italy are out of business.
[02:55:19.099 --> 02:55:20.860]  Ciao, ciao.
[02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:21.941]  Bye bye.
[02:55:21.961 --> 02:55:22.021]  Why?
[02:55:23.001 --> 02:55:34.008]  Thanks to the COVID war and the imbecile moron low lives that locked down the country right after China locked down theirs, Italy followed.
[02:55:34.808 --> 02:55:40.612]  Then you put on top of that the soaring inflation because of the sanctions.
[02:55:42.273 --> 02:55:44.094]  Remember Biden was going to punish Putin?
[02:55:44.794 --> 02:55:46.015]  The people are being punished.
[02:55:47.952 --> 02:55:49.113]  We're being punished.
[02:55:49.133 --> 02:55:51.754]  I'm going to make this really clear.
[02:55:53.175 --> 02:55:57.518]  If we don't unite for peace, we are going to die in war.
[02:55:58.358 --> 02:56:00.319]  People don't have a clue what's going on.
[02:56:00.779 --> 02:56:11.886]  All of a sudden there's going to be some, oh my God, look what happened, like 9-11, 88% of the people believe that little moron daddy's boy, George W. Bush.
[02:56:12.886 --> 02:56:15.428]  Again, we must unite for peace.
[02:56:17.338 --> 02:56:19.879]  And we went to war in Afghanistan for 20 years.
[02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:22.280]  Those dirty Russians.
[02:56:23.801 --> 02:56:25.662]  Support InfoWars, do all you can.
[02:56:25.682 --> 02:56:27.322]  We'll see you next week.
[02:56:27.903 --> 02:56:29.523]  And subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[02:56:29.944 --> 02:56:30.964]  History before it happens.
[02:56:32.248 --> 02:56:39.410]  One of the ways that you encourage your audience to give you money is in cryptocurrency donations, right?
[02:56:39.470 --> 02:56:39.770]  Yes.

[02:56:55.436 --> 02:56:55.816]  Yes.

[02:56:57.118 --> 02:56:57.518]  Yes.

[02:57:03.944 --> 02:57:04.545]  This is it.

[02:57:36.077 --> 02:57:37.578]  InfoWars!
[02:57:41.118 --> 02:57:43.641]  Speaking of Infowars, I brought you a gift.
[02:57:43.701 --> 02:57:44.822]  I just got it today.
[02:57:45.743 --> 02:57:51.170]  The number one selling book on planet Earth, but the New York Times said it's not.
[02:57:51.490 --> 02:57:55.014]  Apparently it's like, I'm glad my mother's dead, is the number one book.
[02:57:56.095 --> 02:58:00.620]  The Great Reset and the War for the World by Alex Jones, signed!
[02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:04.364]  And I was actually there the day that these came into the studio, my lovely.
[02:58:04.384 --> 02:58:04.804]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:58:04.824 --> 02:58:05.425]  What an honor.
[02:58:05.465 --> 02:58:10.350]  If you want to know what's going to happen next by the prophet himself, read the book.
[02:58:10.530 --> 02:58:12.352]  And people want to know how he knows what he knows?
[02:58:12.652 --> 02:58:14.154]  Because he reads their writings.
[02:58:14.374 --> 02:58:15.775]  They tell you what they're going to do.
[02:58:15.955 --> 02:58:16.316]  They do.
[02:58:16.696 --> 02:58:18.316]  So everyone needs to go out and get this book.
[02:58:18.356 --> 02:58:20.897]  If you have not already, I have been dying to read it myself.
[02:58:20.977 --> 02:58:21.537]  I can't wait.
[02:58:21.577 --> 02:58:23.098]  Thank you so much, Matt.
[02:58:23.118 --> 02:58:24.438]  Thank you so much, Alex Jones.
[02:58:24.538 --> 02:58:28.199]  You are the legend himself, as well as Matt.
[02:58:28.559 --> 02:58:29.520]  Red lock, Alex Jones.
[02:58:29.600 --> 02:58:30.540]  We gotta get him on here.
[02:58:30.740 --> 02:58:31.380]  We do, yes.
[02:58:31.780 --> 02:58:33.301]  Why don't we talk about cryptocurrency?
[02:58:35.501 --> 02:58:43.739]   Because one of the ways that you encourage your audience to give you money is in cryptocurrency donations, right?
[02:58:43.739 --> 02:58:44.239]  Yes.
[02:58:44.239 --> 02:58:48.240]   And you have a page on your website that's just for cryptocurrency donations, right?
[02:58:48.240 --> 02:58:53.240]   InfoWars.com/crypto Is that a little advertisement just there?
[02:58:53.240 --> 02:58:54.740]  Well, we're fighting the deep state. We need money.
[02:58:54.740 --> 02:58:55.740]  Okay, alright.
[02:58:55.740 --> 02:58:56.740]  This is it.
[02:58:56.740 --> 02:58:59.740]  Give crypto fun InfoWars.
[02:58:59.740 --> 02:59:03.740]  Sponsor us with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, right?
[02:59:03.740 --> 02:59:06.240]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight.
[02:59:06.240 --> 02:59:08.740]  Your advertisement for your cryptocurrency page.
[02:59:09.740 --> 02:59:14.240]  You know, I mean, people want to keep us in the fight.
[02:59:14.240 --> 02:59:17.740]   So I hope whoever the big whales are, they'll give us money before we keep doing it.
[02:59:18.192 --> 02:59:19.273]  We'll just keep, we'll just keep.
[02:59:19.754 --> 02:59:21.255]  We need some money, guys.
[02:59:21.295 --> 02:59:22.015]  You're in this courtroom.
[02:59:22.035 --> 02:59:22.816]  I got you, I got you.
[02:59:22.936 --> 02:59:25.638]  Alright, let's move on.
[02:59:25.698 --> 02:59:26.779]  People care about the First Amendment.
