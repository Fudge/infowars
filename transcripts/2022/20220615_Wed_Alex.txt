[00:00.000 --> 00:09.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, this fun day, history was made right here in this studio with Mike
[00:09.240 --> 00:10.240]  Adams.
[00:10.240 --> 00:18.800]  He had a microscope and was investigating the vaccine blood clots that are getting pulled
[00:18.800 --> 00:26.520]  out of victims' bodies and he sat right here at this desk with a microscope live on TV
[00:26.520 --> 00:27.520]  doing it.
[00:27.520 --> 00:40.080]  Greg Rees has a follow-up report with some of the more shocking images from that day.
[00:40.080 --> 00:45.880]  The evidence of vaccine death and injuries is overwhelming to anyone capable of seeing
[00:45.880 --> 00:50.560]  past the mainstream media's hypnotic lies.
[00:50.560 --> 00:56.240]  The numbers tell us that the vaccines have already caused a 20% increase in deaths.
[00:56.240 --> 01:02.560]  Now we have a run rate of about 20% excess mortality that's confirmed by the CDC numbers,
[01:02.560 --> 01:04.960]  the funeral home numbers, and the insurance company numbers.
[01:04.960 --> 01:09.520]  And then somebody did an independent study I saw recently suggesting 20% is the number.
[01:09.520 --> 01:11.560]  So we're running a 20% excess deaths.
[01:11.560 --> 01:14.360]  And a 10% increase in disabilities.
[01:14.360 --> 01:16.000]  This is a stunning number.
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.320]  You're telling me that things have been flat for five years of 29 million and all of a sudden
[01:19.320 --> 01:23.600]  out of the data they got 3 million people who are disabled out of nowhere.
[01:23.600 --> 01:27.920]  And now we are beginning to understand that this is just the beginning.
[01:27.920 --> 01:30.880]  Things are going to get much, much worse.
[01:30.880 --> 01:36.960]  Many of us have already seen the mysterious objects found in the vials of COVID vaccines
[01:36.960 --> 01:42.040]  by two separate independent groups using electron microscopy.
[01:42.040 --> 01:47.120]  We are also familiar with the rising number of strokes, heart attacks, and other side
[01:47.120 --> 01:54.200]  effects experienced worldwide after the biggest experimental vaccination in history.
[01:54.200 --> 01:59.120]  And now we are getting a first glimpse of what is causing all this.
[01:59.120 --> 02:03.720]  Something in the COVID vaccines seems to be growing within the recipient's vascular
[02:03.720 --> 02:05.320]  system.
[02:05.320 --> 02:10.400]  Anomalous objects are being discovered in the dead bodies of the vaccinated biome bombers
[02:10.400 --> 02:17.080]  and coroners, horrific things being grown inside the veins and arteries.
[02:17.080 --> 02:22.880]  These are not blood clots, and they appear to be some sort of organic material with
[02:22.880 --> 02:31.400]  small crystals and extremely thin wires made up of what looks like reptilian scales.
[02:31.400 --> 02:37.080]  This internal blockage growing within the vaccinated would certainly explain all of
[02:37.080 --> 02:43.240]  the deadly side effects we are seeing today, what the mainstream media is currently spinning
[02:43.240 --> 02:47.600]  as sudden adult death syndrome.
[02:47.600 --> 02:52.720]  We do not know what these things are, but they are being found by embalmers and coroners
[02:52.720 --> 02:53.720]  everywhere.
[02:53.720 --> 03:00.760]  Except, pretty much all of them are too afraid to speak out, or they don't care.
[03:00.760 --> 03:07.520]  Only one has shown the courage to speak out so far, and this is the real tragedy.
[03:07.520 --> 03:11.280]  For those who remain silent, things will not get better.
[03:11.280 --> 03:17.800]  The FDA is poised to authorize these deadly vaccines to children as young as six months
[03:17.800 --> 03:21.080]  old, and humanity does nothing.
[03:21.080 --> 03:25.640]  Today, we want to provide an update on a topic that I know many parents and grandparents
[03:25.640 --> 03:26.640]  are focused on.
[03:26.640 --> 03:32.640]  The potential for the first COVID-19 vaccines for kids under five.
[03:32.640 --> 03:35.360]  We have waited a long time for this moment.
[03:35.360 --> 03:37.160]  Well guys, here's some good news.
[03:37.160 --> 03:41.480]  The Biden administration has finally announced a vaccine rollout plan for children under
[03:41.480 --> 03:45.200]  five, and they've ordered 10 million doses.
[03:45.200 --> 03:49.400]  That's great.
[03:49.400 --> 03:52.480]  Right now, kids are like, oh my gosh, we could finally meet up for drinks.
[03:52.480 --> 03:57.040]  Yep, as we speak, everyone in the lollipop industry is like, we're buying a yacht, here
[03:57.040 --> 03:59.480]  we go, you get a lollipop, you get one.
[03:59.480 --> 04:01.920]  It's very exciting to hear a four-year-old scream.
[04:01.920 --> 04:04.320]  Facebook told me Bill Gates controls the vaccines.
[04:04.320 --> 04:12.560]  Why should we deserve anything other than pain and suffering if we do nothing to protect
[04:12.560 --> 04:14.680]  our own children?
[04:14.680 --> 04:21.080]  Once those afraid of speaking out begin seeing their coroner tables filled with dead children,
[04:21.080 --> 04:22.600]  it will be too late.
[04:22.600 --> 04:24.600]  But it's not too late now.
[04:24.600 --> 04:30.680]  If you are an embalmer, a coroner, or a funeral director, and you are seeing these things,
[04:30.680 --> 04:35.600]  there is still time to save the lives of our innocent children.
[04:35.600 --> 04:42.920]  You can start now by contacting Dr. Jane Ruby at protonmail.com.
[04:42.920 --> 04:47.320]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:47.320 --> 04:49.320]  Pretty amazing to think, isn't it?
[04:49.320 --> 04:51.400]  And this is all happening.
[04:51.400 --> 04:53.360]  You're experiencing it, you're witnessing all of it.
[04:53.360 --> 05:01.640]  Here's what Greg Rees' report can be found at band.video.
[05:01.640 --> 05:06.880]  There's an old Bedouin saying that's thousands of years old, and it goes like this, trust
[05:06.880 --> 05:09.720]  in God, but tie up your camel.
[05:09.720 --> 05:13.960]  Hunter S. Thompson put it this way, pray to God, but row away from the rocks.
[05:13.960 --> 05:17.920]  If your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you don't get smashed on him
[05:17.920 --> 05:19.920]  and killed, but also try to row away.
[05:19.920 --> 05:24.080]  You can't just sit there like a jellyfish, and it's the same thing with our immune system.
[05:24.080 --> 05:26.160]  God helps those who help themselves.

[06:18.360 --> 06:34.320]  Shroyer, ladies and gentlemen, we are live here on this Wednesday, June 15th edition
[06:34.320 --> 06:38.480]  of the Alex Jones show.
[06:38.480 --> 06:42.960]  Owen Shroyer still sitting in for Alex, just a couple more days, just a couple more days,
[06:42.960 --> 06:47.320]  the boss will be back, and we may be hearing from him throughout the transmission today.
[06:47.320 --> 06:53.600]  I'm actually going to be with you till 6pm tonight, so double duty for me, and I've got
[06:53.600 --> 07:01.360]  six plus hours of news coverage here and video clips to get to, so there will be no shortage
[07:01.360 --> 07:06.920]  of information distribution today.
[07:06.920 --> 07:09.800]  Let me just tell you what's coming up.
[07:09.800 --> 07:18.760]  You do have some latest breaking, if you will, January 6th panel news where they're
[07:18.760 --> 07:24.000]  now delaying the hearings because nobody's watching, it's actually hurting the Democrats,
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.280]  so they decided to cancel it, just shows it's all political.
[07:27.280 --> 07:29.800]  They did it because they thought it would help them politically, it ended up hurting
[07:29.800 --> 07:33.400]  them politically, they're no longer doing it anymore, so it just shows it's not about
[07:33.400 --> 07:38.000]  Justice or January 6th, it's all about Democrat party agenda politics.
[07:38.000 --> 07:46.480]  But Ted Cruz grilled the FBI representative about REAPs to which the rep, I'm not trying
[07:46.480 --> 07:49.680]  to be funny, I don't know if it's a man or a woman, okay, it's one of those deals, it's
[07:49.680 --> 07:50.680]  a he-shee.
[07:50.680 --> 07:55.040]  Okay, they got the he-shee's running the FBI now, so I'm sure that'll be good, and the
[07:55.040 --> 08:01.240]  he-shee couldn't answer any of the questions, of course, and they're saying, oh well, we're
[08:01.240 --> 08:08.160]  not gonna have any criminal referrals of Trump or any of the defendants because, well, that
[08:08.160 --> 08:12.240]  has all their brainwashed minions upset, they're saying, what are you talking about?
[08:12.240 --> 08:16.200]  I thought this whole thing was about getting rid of Trump and arresting all of his people.
[08:16.200 --> 08:23.360]  Oh no, see, the Democrats don't actually wanna do that because they know if that standard
[08:23.360 --> 08:26.880]  is held to them, they're all gonna be arrested.
[08:26.880 --> 08:31.840]  You know, Maxine Waters calling for violence, Chuck Schumer calling for violence, assassination
[08:31.840 --> 08:38.160]  attempts by Democrats happening every year, multiple times a year, so they don't want
[08:38.160 --> 08:43.760]  that standard to be set and held to them because they know, well, ultimately they'd look worse
[08:43.760 --> 08:46.240]  than Trump if that were the case.
[08:46.240 --> 08:52.320]  Yeah, they try to bury Democrat terrorism, but we all know it goes on, and it continues
[08:52.320 --> 08:58.960]  this week as they're really, really just chomping at the bit to start rioting and raging and
[08:58.960 --> 09:02.600]  rampaging if they can't murder their babies, which you'll still be able to do.
[09:02.600 --> 09:05.000]  I don't know why they're so panicked, you'll still be able to do that, it's just gonna
[09:05.000 --> 09:07.120]  be up to the states.
[09:07.120 --> 09:11.160]  The very notion, the very thought, the very breath that they might not be able to murder
[09:11.160 --> 09:14.440]  their babies just drives them up a wall.
[09:14.440 --> 09:19.480]  But yes, there are counter protesters, I salute this young girl who went out there.
[09:19.480 --> 09:23.880]  You know, the left interrupts protests all the time and they do their counter protesting
[09:23.880 --> 09:25.280]  and they get loud and obnoxious.
[09:25.280 --> 09:29.200]  We all witness it, but oh, if conservatives try to do that, they get bullied and pushed
[09:29.200 --> 09:34.320]  around and, well, I've dealt with this too many times to speak of, but good for that
[09:34.320 --> 09:37.800]  lady for counter protesting them calling abortion murder.
[09:37.800 --> 09:42.760]  They don't like that, they don't like that at all.
[09:42.760 --> 09:53.120]  And you know, the whole psychology here is they don't like the truth about themselves.
[09:53.120 --> 09:57.120]  Is the best way I could put it, Dan Bongino has been saying they don't like a mirror held
[09:57.120 --> 09:58.120]  it to their face.
[09:58.120 --> 10:04.560]  It's one way of putting it, but the point is they don't like the truth about themselves.
[10:04.560 --> 10:08.920]  They know abortion is murder, they still want to be able to do it and not feel any guilt
[10:08.920 --> 10:13.000]  or have any guilt cast upon them.
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.280]  But think about the Libs of TikTok situation.
[10:16.280 --> 10:19.760]  Libs of TikTok does no original content.
[10:19.760 --> 10:23.640]  No original content from the lady that runs Libs of TikTok.
[10:23.640 --> 10:33.680]  All she does is take liberals from mostly TikTok, it's like 95% TikTok videos, liberals
[10:33.680 --> 10:35.440]  that post them.
[10:35.440 --> 10:37.080]  Liberals publish this stuff.
[10:37.080 --> 10:42.920]  They publicly put it on the internet and Libs of TikTok just takes it and repost it on the
[10:42.920 --> 10:48.400]  Twitter account that she runs, Libs of TikTok and Twitter wants it banned and the left wants
[10:48.400 --> 10:50.600]  it banned.
[10:50.600 --> 10:51.680]  Why?
[10:51.680 --> 10:53.960]  Because they don't like the truth about themselves.
[10:53.960 --> 10:59.680]  There is no original content that comes from Libs of TikTok, it comes from Libs that they
[10:59.680 --> 11:00.680]  put on the internet.
[11:00.680 --> 11:03.920]  So why wouldn't all the original creators of the content be getting banned?
[11:03.920 --> 11:06.120]  Why isn't only Libs of TikTok?
[11:06.120 --> 11:09.480]  Because they don't like the truth about themselves.
[11:09.480 --> 11:14.360]  That's why you go up to an abortion rally with a sign that says abortion is murder,
[11:14.360 --> 11:19.560]  you start seeing them flip out like raging banshees because they don't like the truth
[11:19.560 --> 11:20.960]  about themselves.
[11:20.960 --> 11:22.840]  But let me just move on.
[11:22.840 --> 11:31.040]  We've got some more other news here regarding the midterm elections, some primaries, some
[11:31.040 --> 11:32.800]  election results from last night.
[11:32.800 --> 11:35.360]  It's really all good news.
[11:35.360 --> 11:42.480]  I don't know how much we can really trust elections right now for obvious reasons, but
[11:42.480 --> 11:46.800]  if you follow the primaries or you've been following the primaries, there's a reason
[11:46.800 --> 11:52.720]  why even the Democrat media is saying we're screwed because Republicans are out drawing
[11:52.720 --> 12:00.160]  Democrats right now almost double and they're flipping seats that have been held by Democrats
[12:00.160 --> 12:03.080]  for decades like something that happened last night.
[12:03.080 --> 12:07.480]  So we'll cover that coming up as well.
[12:07.480 --> 12:11.160]  And interesting, I hadn't covered this yet and I don't know if anybody at InfoWars had
[12:11.160 --> 12:13.640]  really covered it too much.
[12:13.640 --> 12:19.120]  The Patriot Front group getting arrested in Idaho, I've kept my hands off that because,
[12:19.120 --> 12:21.720]  well, for obvious reasons.
[12:21.720 --> 12:25.800]  And I think we've kind of got our first little riff that gives us an idea of what's really
[12:25.800 --> 12:26.800]  going on here.
[12:26.800 --> 12:35.000]  It's not quite what we all expected, but yeah, let's just say, let's just say we've got our
[12:35.000 --> 12:41.400]  first, I think, window into what's going on with the Patriot Front group as if it's not
[12:41.400 --> 12:42.400]  our first window.
[12:42.400 --> 12:47.880]  We've had other windows like the Lincoln Project involvement and then of course showing up
[12:47.880 --> 12:53.640]  at these other events clearly well organized.
[12:53.640 --> 12:58.960]  And so could there be federal embeds and law enforcement embeds?
[12:58.960 --> 13:04.480]  Well, we've got a little interesting news update on that today as well.
[13:04.480 --> 13:05.480]  Let's see here.
[13:05.480 --> 13:06.960]  Biden continues to falter.
[13:06.960 --> 13:10.360]  The ratings continue to plummet for Biden.
[13:10.360 --> 13:16.560]  The approval ratings, that is, he's getting more obstinate in his speeches starting to
[13:16.560 --> 13:17.760]  really sound like Hitler.
[13:17.760 --> 13:22.360]  Like, you know, Hitler would scream into the mic, be very passionate.
[13:22.360 --> 13:25.440]  Now Biden is screaming into the mic telling you everything's Putin's fault.
[13:25.440 --> 13:29.200]  So we've got those clips and some of the latest news as well.
[13:29.200 --> 13:40.480]  Boy, oh boy, you know, it's just one of those deals where, you know, the old saying I hate
[13:40.480 --> 13:49.160]  to say, I told you so, it's just we might as well put it into the wall here somewhere.
[13:49.160 --> 13:52.600]  We might as well scrape it into the wall here somewhere because it's really just getting
[13:52.600 --> 13:53.600]  ridiculous.
[13:53.600 --> 13:56.080]  They hate to say, I told you so stuff.
[13:56.080 --> 14:03.600]  And so now Biden is tapping into the oil reserves again, again.
[14:03.600 --> 14:11.560]  And once he had the first release, I said on the war room, he's going to release more
[14:11.560 --> 14:13.920]  than half of our strategic oil reserves.
[14:13.920 --> 14:15.200]  Biden has now done that.
[14:15.200 --> 14:20.200]  Oh, and it's all in the name of lowering prices, except here's the thing, it's the reserves
[14:20.200 --> 14:21.200]  aren't coming to the U.S.
[14:21.200 --> 14:23.440]  They're going to Europe, folks.
[14:23.440 --> 14:24.440]  So he's done it again.
[14:24.440 --> 14:26.440]  We'll have that coming up.
[14:26.440 --> 14:30.160]  Oh, you got a wide open southern border, by the way.
[14:30.160 --> 14:34.560]  You got a wide open southern border, three million illegal immigrants pouring over it
[14:34.560 --> 14:36.800]  every year.
[14:36.800 --> 14:38.160]  And now they're voting.
[14:38.160 --> 14:39.320]  And now they're voting.
[14:39.320 --> 14:44.680]  And so when you step back and you look at what's going on with the illegal immigration
[14:44.680 --> 14:50.960]  and the open border, I mean, folks, there is a criminal organization enterprise happening
[14:50.960 --> 14:51.960]  here.
[14:51.960 --> 14:58.440]  I mean, it is so ridiculous that no other explanation should even be heard.
[14:58.440 --> 15:02.760]  It is a criminal operation, what's going on at the southern border.
[15:02.760 --> 15:05.120]  And I think it's just such a large criminal operation.
[15:05.120 --> 15:07.080]  There's so many different odds and ends to it.
[15:07.080 --> 15:11.680]  So many different people profiting, but we'll have that coming up.
[15:11.680 --> 15:21.560]  Oh, my, the stack of vaccine news and health news today, yikes, yikes.
[15:21.560 --> 15:29.320]  I mean, they publish stories and we've got the proof with headlines.
[15:29.320 --> 15:34.120]  Moderna COVID vaccine may pose higher heart inflammation risk, U.S. CDC.
[15:34.120 --> 15:39.680]  And then they have to change the headline, U.S. FDA advisors overwhelmingly back Moderna
[15:39.680 --> 15:40.680]  COVID vaccine.
[15:40.680 --> 15:43.080]  So the original headline is this vaccine's killing people.
[15:43.080 --> 15:44.080]  And then they edit it.
[15:44.080 --> 15:48.440]  And they say, oh, no, look, the U.S. government says that it's good.
[15:48.440 --> 15:53.920]  And of course, we've got more of the groomers coming after your children, liberal groomers.
[15:53.920 --> 15:59.880]  They are real sick freaks, aren't they?
[15:59.880 --> 16:05.200]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex Jones was right.
[16:05.200 --> 16:07.040]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[16:07.040 --> 16:11.200]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[16:11.200 --> 16:12.880]  I tried to stop it.
[16:12.880 --> 16:17.920]  And now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[16:17.920 --> 16:23.080]  the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents.
[16:23.080 --> 16:24.720]  It's now out in the open.
[16:24.720 --> 16:30.280]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[16:30.280 --> 16:31.280]  Group.
[16:31.280 --> 16:34.280]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[16:34.280 --> 16:37.480]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[16:37.480 --> 16:38.480]  We're going to win this thing.
[16:38.480 --> 16:39.480]  God's watching.
[16:39.480 --> 16:40.480]  The children are counting on us.
[16:40.480 --> 16:44.120]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[16:44.120 --> 16:47.520]  your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[16:47.520 --> 16:51.880]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are
[16:51.880 --> 16:54.240]  the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[16:54.240 --> 16:58.760]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[16:58.760 --> 16:59.760]  your efforts.
[16:59.760 --> 17:01.400]  The globalists are making their move.
[17:01.400 --> 17:02.400]  They're a great reset.
[17:02.400 --> 17:03.400]  It's here.
[17:03.400 --> 17:04.880]  They're coming for your children.
[17:04.880 --> 17:07.200]  They're coming for the value of your currency.
[17:07.200 --> 17:09.320]  They're coming for your national sovereignty.
[17:09.320 --> 17:14.000]  They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny.
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.320]  They're coming for your free speech.
[17:16.320 --> 17:18.200]  They're coming for your privacy.
[17:18.200 --> 17:23.120]  And ladies and gentlemen, they're coming for your right to vote and have your representative
[17:23.120 --> 17:26.560]  and government that you and your fellow Americans choose.

[18:59.400 --> 19:04.280]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Roots Supplement
[19:04.280 --> 19:08.080]  that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[19:08.080 --> 19:12.280]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today though it
[19:12.280 --> 19:17.400]  has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric
[19:17.400 --> 19:18.400]  effects.
[19:18.400 --> 19:24.000]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.400]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[19:28.400 --> 19:33.080]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[19:33.080 --> 19:34.280]  loosen up a little.
[19:34.280 --> 19:38.760]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[19:38.760 --> 19:45.160]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava but other
[19:45.160 --> 19:51.880]  herbs including but not limited to German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap and Balerian Root.
[19:51.880 --> 20:00.600]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[20:00.600 --> 20:29.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:29.280 --> 20:33.480]  An election year, midterm elections.
[20:33.480 --> 20:45.200]  Democrats were running against Republicans more exactly Donald Trump on high gas prices.
[20:45.200 --> 20:47.320]  Do you remember that?
[20:47.320 --> 20:51.640]  Do you remember Democrats running against high gas prices, blaming Donald Trump for that,
[20:51.640 --> 20:55.160]  talking about it was a national emergency?
[20:55.160 --> 20:57.080]  How much was gas at the time you ask?
[20:57.080 --> 20:59.440]  $3.89 national average.
[20:59.440 --> 21:07.240]  Here was Chuck Schumer attacking President Trump in 2018 as Democrats' strategy in the
[21:07.240 --> 21:10.720]  midterms was to blame Trump for high gas prices saying they're out of control.
[21:10.720 --> 21:13.560]  Here's a little flashback for you in clip three.
[21:13.560 --> 21:20.000]  President Trump can take action today to help alleviate the pain at the pump for Americans.
[21:20.000 --> 21:25.240]  It's time for this president to stand up to OPEC on behalf of the forgotten man and
[21:25.240 --> 21:28.040]  woman he promised to remember.
[21:28.040 --> 21:29.640]  Wow.
[21:29.640 --> 21:31.880]  Well now do Biden, Chuck.
[21:31.880 --> 21:34.200]  Now do Biden.
[21:34.200 --> 21:39.800]  Now that gas is at a national average of over $5 a gallon, now do Biden, Chuck.
[21:39.800 --> 21:44.440]  So gas at $3.89 a gallon national average, the Democrats used that to run against Trump
[21:44.440 --> 21:46.040]  in the midterms.
[21:46.040 --> 21:50.360]  Chuck Schumer makes speeches like that, demanding Trump do something about people's pain at
[21:50.360 --> 21:51.640]  the pump.
[21:51.640 --> 21:55.880]  Now it's almost $2 more than when Chuck Schumer was crying about it.
[21:55.880 --> 21:59.560]  And he has nothing to say.
[21:59.560 --> 22:08.600]  And by the way, now U.S. to sell up to 45 million barrels of oil from its strategic
[22:08.600 --> 22:12.240]  oil reserve and part of historic release.
[22:12.240 --> 22:15.080]  This is now the third release from Joe Biden.
[22:15.080 --> 22:21.160]  This is now the third release from Joe Biden of our oil reserve.
[22:21.160 --> 22:24.520]  Whatever needed to happen, not one of them even needed to happen.
[22:24.520 --> 22:29.920]  The oil reserve has now depleted more than 50% since Biden has taken office.
[22:29.920 --> 22:32.720]  Whenever the next president replaces Biden, there's going to be nothing.
[22:32.720 --> 22:38.600]  There's going to be no oil reserves as the world is going into chaos and we're closer
[22:38.600 --> 22:41.560]  to nuclear war than ever before maybe.
[22:41.560 --> 22:44.800]  And we're going to have no strategic oil reserves because Biden is giving it all away.
[22:44.800 --> 22:48.160]  And by the way, it's not going to Americans.
[22:48.160 --> 22:50.880]  It's not staying right here in the homeland.
[22:50.880 --> 22:52.880]  It's going to Europe.
[22:52.880 --> 22:58.320]  It's going to Europe because here's what's happening.
[22:58.320 --> 23:03.080]  European leaders are calling up Biden and saying, hey, you piece of crap.
[23:03.080 --> 23:07.120]  What in the F are you doing?
[23:07.120 --> 23:12.160]  Your war with Russia is now costing us and you giving Russia control of the pipelines
[23:12.160 --> 23:16.040]  going into Europe is costing us even more.
[23:16.040 --> 23:21.320]  And then you have the Biden administration saying, oh, you think it's hard on you?
[23:21.320 --> 23:22.640]  You should see gas in Europe.
[23:22.640 --> 23:26.280]  Well, yeah, because Biden did that to Europe.
[23:26.280 --> 23:30.800]  And so European leaders call up Biden and they say, hey, you piece of crap, keeping
[23:30.800 --> 23:32.200]  it censored.
[23:32.200 --> 23:35.080]  You're crushing our economy.
[23:35.080 --> 23:37.040]  You're causing our people to pay more at the pump.
[23:37.040 --> 23:38.440]  You think you can do something about that?
[23:38.440 --> 23:40.760]  You jerk.
[23:40.760 --> 23:43.120]  You imbecile.
[23:43.120 --> 23:44.120]  And so what does Biden do?
[23:44.120 --> 23:45.880]  He says, well, okay.
[23:45.880 --> 23:50.120]  And he gives them our strategic or reserves.
[23:50.120 --> 23:54.280]  That's what's going on, folks.
[23:54.280 --> 24:01.920]  Biden is so inept that he's even causing Europeans gas prices to double.
[24:01.920 --> 24:03.200]  Everyone knows it's Biden.
[24:03.200 --> 24:08.680]  So European leaders call up Biden and they say, you're so pathetic, our gas prices have
[24:08.680 --> 24:09.680]  doubled.
[24:09.680 --> 24:12.200]  And Biden says, well, hey, keep that under wraps.
[24:12.200 --> 24:13.440]  Don't say anything.
[24:13.440 --> 24:14.640]  Don't blame it on me.
[24:14.640 --> 24:19.680]  I'll send you our strategic or reserves to shut up to just so Biden is basically paying
[24:19.680 --> 24:26.320]  for the silence of European leaders with oil because he's cost their prices to double
[24:26.320 --> 24:29.400]  as well.
[24:29.400 --> 24:34.640]  So when you see it like this, gas prices hit new all time high as EU considers blocking
[24:34.640 --> 24:36.440]  Russian oil.
[24:36.440 --> 24:38.520]  Biden keeps restrictions.
[24:38.520 --> 24:40.880]  They can't block the Russian oil, folks.
[24:40.880 --> 24:43.160]  They need it.
[24:43.160 --> 24:46.240]  Biden gave Russia control of the pipeline.
[24:46.240 --> 24:51.680]  So to pay for European leaders' silence, Biden is paying them off in oil.
[24:51.680 --> 24:56.160]  I mean, unbelievable that we're dealing with this.
[24:56.160 --> 24:58.360]  Unbelievable we're dealing with this corruption.
[24:58.360 --> 25:05.280]  So not only is he illegitimately, unnecessarily, tapping into our strategic or reserves, he's
[25:05.280 --> 25:12.920]  giving them to Europe to pay for their silence because they're so obsessed with trying to
[25:12.920 --> 25:16.240]  label this the Putin price hike, which everyone knows it's not.
[25:16.240 --> 25:18.720]  Everyone knows it's the Biden price hike worldwide.
[25:18.720 --> 25:22.720]  So he's paying for European silence with our oil.
[25:22.720 --> 25:23.720]  Unbelievable stuff.
[25:23.720 --> 25:30.480]  And then Biden tells oil refiners produce more gas and have less profits.
[25:30.480 --> 25:35.480]  He thinks you're stupid or he knows his voters are stupid, folks.
[25:35.480 --> 25:40.360]  Gas prices change depending on regulations, availability, all this stuff.
[25:40.360 --> 25:44.520]  I'm not going to go into a long diatribe here.
[25:44.520 --> 25:48.480]  But to sit here and act like Biden, hey oil companies, lower your prices.
[25:48.480 --> 25:49.480]  Like it's that.
[25:49.480 --> 25:50.480]  What are you talking about?
[25:50.480 --> 25:56.120]  There's an entire international oil community of purchasing oil and price per barrel and
[25:56.120 --> 25:57.400]  all this stuff.
[25:57.400 --> 26:02.720]  By the time it's get your hand touching the pump going into your car, there's like thousands
[26:02.720 --> 26:05.200]  of regulations.
[26:05.200 --> 26:11.360]  And it's actually the owner of the gas station that's deciding that price based off all the
[26:11.360 --> 26:17.040]  other stuff that's happened 100,000 things before it even gets to them.
[26:17.040 --> 26:21.960]  So it's just ludicrous to say, oh, produce more gas as he's making it illegal to produce
[26:21.960 --> 26:22.960]  more gas.
[26:22.960 --> 26:25.200]  And he says, oh, fewer profits.
[26:25.200 --> 26:30.080]  Well, that's just, that's just anti-capitalism.
[26:30.080 --> 26:33.120]  But okay, fine, you're against corporate greed.
[26:33.120 --> 26:34.560]  But so what are they supposed to do?
[26:34.560 --> 26:36.720]  John Kerry has gas prices skyrocket.
[26:36.720 --> 26:39.100]  We absolutely don't need to drill for more oil.
[26:39.100 --> 26:41.520]  So Biden says, produce more oil.
[26:41.520 --> 26:43.760]  The gas companies say, well, how do you want me to do that?
[26:43.760 --> 26:45.480]  I guess we'll have to drill.
[26:45.480 --> 26:47.760]  And then the Biden administration says, no, don't drill.
[26:47.760 --> 26:50.200]  What are they supposed to do?
[26:50.200 --> 26:56.960]  Like wave a magic wand, abracadabra, and just produce gas?
[26:56.960 --> 26:59.200]  It's completely insane.
[26:59.200 --> 27:01.760]  But here's a compilation.
[27:01.760 --> 27:07.240]  Everything Biden, or everything Trump warned you about Biden comes true here in clip 11.
[27:07.240 --> 27:12.680]  Before I took office, there was a lot of folks out there, a lot of folks out there making
[27:12.680 --> 27:16.440]  some pretty bold predictions about how things would turn out.
[27:16.440 --> 27:18.840]  You might remember some of the predictions.
[27:18.840 --> 27:23.600]  They're coming for your guns, they're coming for your jobs, and they're coming for your
[27:23.600 --> 27:24.600]  freedom.
[27:24.600 --> 27:28.560]  They hate American energy, and Joe Biden will shut it all down.
[27:28.560 --> 27:35.680]  He's going to, if I became president, if Biden's elected, he will wipe out your energy
[27:35.680 --> 27:36.680]  industry.
[27:36.680 --> 27:42.800]  Another prediction that is my favorite one, I must add, is that if I got elected, gas
[27:42.800 --> 27:51.800]  prices going $5, $6, $7 for a gallon, in larger communities with criminal aliens, drugs and
[27:51.800 --> 27:57.240]  crime, while they live behind beautiful gated compounds.
[27:57.240 --> 28:02.760]  They try to take away your guns, second amendment, they want to take it away, while they enjoy
[28:02.760 --> 28:05.360]  private security that's fully armed.
[28:05.360 --> 28:07.320]  I never understood that one.
[28:07.320 --> 28:13.840]  Spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending
[28:13.840 --> 28:14.840]  foreign borders.
[28:14.840 --> 28:19.760]  For all those predictions of Dilma Gloom, six months in, here's Roy Stam.
[28:19.760 --> 28:22.400]  Do you already use the word recession or depression?
[28:22.400 --> 28:26.320]  Think of the single mom, struggling to put food on the table each month.
[28:26.320 --> 28:28.240]  You know, it's, it's sad.
[28:28.240 --> 28:33.680]  So if your primary concern right now is inflation, we could stop it in 30 minutes.
[28:33.680 --> 28:37.920]  When I took office, he finally went outside, he went to get an ice cream.
[28:37.920 --> 28:42.680]  Look, the bottom line is this, I say you're not doing a very good job, because he can't
[28:42.680 --> 28:48.120]  take any questions now from the press.
[28:48.120 --> 28:49.120]  So there you go.
[28:49.120 --> 28:54.400]  And that was on the campaign trail in 2020, Donald Trump, everything he warned us about

[33:30.680 --> 33:55.680]  New videos, it's Alex Jones and now your host, Owen Shroyer.
[33:55.680 --> 34:06.680]  First, I'm doing everything in my power to blunt Putin's gas price hike.
[34:06.680 --> 34:14.680]  Just since he invaded Ukraine, it's gone up a dollar seventy-four gallon because of nothing
[34:14.680 --> 34:17.640]  else but that.
[34:17.640 --> 34:27.320]  Is that Joe Biden or Adolphus Hitler, I can't tell, same vibes, same vibes for sure, oh,
[34:27.320 --> 34:31.560]  it's nothing else but that, he points at you and screams into the microphone.
[34:31.560 --> 34:38.480]  It's all Putin as he pays for Europe's silence with our strategic oral reserves and it's
[34:38.480 --> 34:40.240]  doubled since he's been into office.
[34:40.240 --> 34:43.800]  Yeah, it's gone up one seventy-four since Putin went to Ukraine, it went up one seventy-four
[34:43.800 --> 34:46.320]  before that too.
[34:46.320 --> 34:51.000]  Just amazing stuff and they expect you to believe this is what's even more incredible
[34:51.000 --> 34:52.000]  about it.
[34:52.000 --> 34:57.760]  They expect you to believe it.
[34:57.760 --> 35:04.760]  But the Biden economy continues to collapse and destroy us.
[35:04.760 --> 35:13.520]  Another U.S. food processing plant erupts into flames and so what is this, like fifty
[35:13.520 --> 35:20.760]  since Biden has taken office, fifty food processing plants or processing centers or even fertilizer
[35:20.760 --> 35:24.680]  processing plants and centers, you've had about fifty of them burned down since Biden
[35:24.680 --> 35:30.160]  got into office, nothing from the DHS, nothing from the FBI, nothing from the White House.
[35:30.160 --> 35:33.000]  We're just supposed to act like that's normal.
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.760]  We're just supposed to act like that's normal for all the food processing plants to be burned
[35:37.760 --> 35:40.920]  to the ground and it's always a fire too.
[35:40.920 --> 35:43.280]  Really just amazing stuff.
[35:43.280 --> 35:48.040]  So if they're not being burned to the ground, they're literally being shut down by Democrats
[35:48.040 --> 35:52.880]  like Smithfield Pork Processing Plant in California, they came out and said, yeah, we're shutting
[35:52.880 --> 35:57.440]  down, we can't afford to exist in California, Democrats have crushed our business.
[35:57.440 --> 36:00.560]  Just like Biden promised he would.
[36:00.560 --> 36:05.560]  And you know, you've probably heard of this story but there's a new riff now and Senator
[36:05.560 --> 36:08.520]  Joni Ersk has the story.
[36:08.520 --> 36:13.160]  But we've heard about how we're paying for the wall that doesn't exist, right?
[36:13.160 --> 36:17.560]  We signed contracts with these companies to build the wall.
[36:17.560 --> 36:21.520]  And Biden has basically said, nope, don't build the wall.
[36:21.520 --> 36:22.520]  It doesn't matter.
[36:22.520 --> 36:23.520]  They're already under contract.
[36:23.520 --> 36:26.120]  We've already bought the materials.
[36:26.120 --> 36:28.720]  We're still paying for them.
[36:28.720 --> 36:32.480]  Biden's charging taxpayers to babysit unused border wall materials.
[36:32.480 --> 36:35.880]  Folks, they're literally sitting down there just sitting there instead of building the
[36:35.880 --> 36:38.800]  wall.
[36:38.800 --> 36:41.000]  Unbelievable stuff.
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.120]  We paid for the wall, we paid for the construction, we paid for the material.
[36:45.120 --> 36:50.000]  And Biden said, nope, we don't want it.
[36:50.000 --> 36:58.600]  And now we have record levels of illegal immigration happening.
[36:58.600 --> 37:04.000]  Illegal aliens set to receive driver's licenses in Massachusetts after state legislature overrides
[37:04.000 --> 37:05.640]  governor's veto.
[37:05.640 --> 37:11.880]  17 states now allow illegal immigrants to get government-issued photo ID.
[37:11.880 --> 37:13.360]  And they vote, too.
[37:13.360 --> 37:15.280]  And they vote.
[37:15.280 --> 37:18.280]  Isn't that nice?
[37:18.280 --> 37:21.760]  What's the point of even having a border we don't?
[37:21.760 --> 37:24.560]  What's the point of even having any laws when we don't have a border?
[37:24.560 --> 37:27.640]  What's the point of paying taxes or having a country when we don't have a border?
[37:27.640 --> 37:33.400]  See, these are the basic common sense stuff they don't want you to ask and realize.
[37:33.400 --> 37:40.280]  Now, folks, I don't want to belabor this point because it's more of a confusion and frustration
[37:40.280 --> 37:44.280]  than anything else.
[37:44.280 --> 37:50.120]  We know what's going on at the southern border as far as it's wide open, 3 million illegals
[37:50.120 --> 37:54.560]  crossing a year, the drug trafficking, the human trafficking, the facilitation of all
[37:54.560 --> 38:00.920]  this now by the border patrol, thanks to the Democrats, the money that gets spent, the hotels,
[38:00.920 --> 38:09.480]  I mean, all of it, but there's something else going on here that I really can't quite
[38:09.480 --> 38:16.320]  put the finger on or the finger of my mind on even.
[38:16.320 --> 38:20.040]  Let me just read the rest of these headlines and try to flesh this out.
[38:20.040 --> 38:26.280]  But I'm telling you, there is something going on at the southern border that is beyond comprehension
[38:26.280 --> 38:27.280]  even.
[38:27.280 --> 38:36.840]  In the survey, 49% of Hondurans and 39% in El Salvador consider migrating, folks, again,
[38:36.840 --> 38:44.440]  there's something unreal happening right now with this southern border being wide open.
[38:44.440 --> 38:49.320]  This is so shocking, it's unbelievable.
[38:49.320 --> 38:55.800]  More than a quarter of the population of Central America has migrated to the United States
[38:55.800 --> 38:57.960]  in the last two decades.
[38:57.960 --> 39:00.120]  Did you hear what I just said?
[39:00.120 --> 39:09.080]  One in four, one in four in Central America has migrated to the United States in the
[39:09.080 --> 39:10.560]  last two decades.
[39:10.560 --> 39:17.640]  One in four, call it an invasion, call it population replacement, call it whatever you
[39:17.640 --> 39:18.640]  want.
[39:18.640 --> 39:21.640]  I mean, folks, that is drastic.
[39:21.640 --> 39:25.040]  That is drastic.
[39:25.040 --> 39:30.520]  That is an entire population exodus movement.
[39:30.520 --> 39:37.080]  I mean, again, I don't even know how to properly, it's an exodus.
[39:37.080 --> 39:40.600]  It's mass migration, it's an invasion.
[39:40.600 --> 39:46.240]  And so you compound that with the fact that you're paying for all of it, someone's paying
[39:46.240 --> 39:49.360]  and facilitating their journey to get here.
[39:49.360 --> 39:52.240]  And then of course, once they get here, then they get all the freebies, all the handouts.
[39:52.240 --> 39:55.640]  That's part of the reason why they come, because they get everything for free.
[39:55.640 --> 39:58.760]  It's a big boondoggle.
[39:58.760 --> 40:00.120]  And the same thing is going on in Europe.
[40:00.120 --> 40:02.520]  And guys, now you can roll the B roll of Clip 6.
[40:02.520 --> 40:04.960]  That's why I had it because of the story here.
[40:04.960 --> 40:10.960]  Europe's migration problems set to worsen as survey shows more than half of young Africans
[40:10.960 --> 40:13.000]  plan to immigrate.
[40:13.000 --> 40:14.960]  Now what happened to France?
[40:14.960 --> 40:18.760]  Here you have Leon in the 1900s.
[40:18.760 --> 40:22.400]  Your 1900 apparently is where this footage is from, recolorized.
[40:22.400 --> 40:24.480]  And then here you have it in 2021.
[40:24.480 --> 40:26.280]  It's a hell hole.
[40:26.280 --> 40:29.160]  It's an S hole.
[40:29.160 --> 40:34.440]  Poverty, crime, trash, desolation everywhere.
[40:34.440 --> 40:38.280]  When a hundred years ago, nothing like that existed in France.
[40:38.280 --> 40:39.440]  What happened?
[40:39.440 --> 40:46.800]  The mass migration, the mass exodus, the mass population replacement, globalism.
[40:46.800 --> 40:49.400]  That's what's happened.
[40:49.400 --> 40:54.240]  But when you think about the numbers, oh, half of young Africans planned to immigrate
[40:54.240 --> 40:58.160]  to Europe, half of Central Americans planned to immigrate to America.
[40:58.160 --> 41:03.080]  I mean, folks, there is something bigger on top of all of this.
[41:03.080 --> 41:09.520]  I think it goes beyond even the realm of politics, but politicians are obviously profiting off
[41:09.520 --> 41:11.920]  of it or being bought off.
[41:11.920 --> 41:14.120]  How can this possibly be going on?
[41:14.120 --> 41:15.800]  Let me finish the headlines.
[41:15.800 --> 41:20.360]  Biden regime to punish Border Patrol agents in horseback incident involving Haitian illegals
[41:20.360 --> 41:22.520]  two months after they were cleared of the charges.
[41:22.520 --> 41:23.720]  Yeah, they lied about that.
[41:23.720 --> 41:25.000]  They said they used whips.
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.000]  There was an investigation.
[41:26.000 --> 41:27.000]  There were no whips.
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.000]  The whole thing was a lie.
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.680]  And so now the Biden regime is punishing them anyway, because it's the Biden regime.
[41:31.680 --> 41:32.680]  It's Democrats.
[41:32.680 --> 41:33.760]  They're worse than Nazis.
[41:33.760 --> 41:36.160]  Border agents rescue 18 illegals from drowning.
[41:36.160 --> 41:37.400]  Can you imagine?
[41:37.400 --> 41:40.640]  Border agents die trying to rescue people from drowning, by the way.
[41:40.640 --> 41:42.240]  Can you imagine you're a Border Patrol agent?
[41:42.240 --> 41:43.240]  You get spat on.
[41:43.240 --> 41:44.240]  You get kicked.
[41:44.240 --> 41:48.800]  You get treated like garbage, treated like dirt by Democrats, by the Biden administration.
[41:48.800 --> 41:54.720]  And you still have the courage and the fortitude to go rescue people drowning.
[41:54.720 --> 41:57.400]  Even though you're never going to be thanked for it, you're going to be punished for it
[41:57.400 --> 41:58.400]  probably.
[41:58.400 --> 42:04.640]  I mean, you don't think people, heartless people with half a mind would say, why should
[42:04.640 --> 42:09.160]  I go risk my life for these illegal immigrants coming here that I'm paying for already anyway
[42:09.160 --> 42:12.760]  when I'm the one being persecuted by my government?
[42:12.760 --> 42:14.360]  And they still do it, folks.
[42:14.360 --> 42:16.680]  They still do it.
[42:16.680 --> 42:22.280]  But okay, aside from the dirty deeds and the corruption and this just sickness of the
[42:22.280 --> 42:27.200]  Democrat Party, again, what is going on at the southern border?
[42:27.200 --> 42:30.320]  Like, what is going on?
[42:30.320 --> 42:33.720]  It makes no sense, none.
[42:33.720 --> 42:35.800]  How do we have a wide open southern border?
[42:35.800 --> 42:38.480]  How do we have 3 million illegal immigrants every year?
[42:38.480 --> 42:41.040]  How come we're paying hundreds of billions of dollars to do it?
[42:41.040 --> 42:46.080]  Why do we also send out hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign aid to these countries
[42:46.080 --> 42:48.520]  so that they don't have to send all their people here?
[42:48.520 --> 42:51.200]  What is going on?
[42:51.200 --> 42:55.520]  Is anybody ever going to look into this and figure out what the hell is going on with
[42:55.520 --> 42:56.520]  the southern border?
[42:56.520 --> 42:57.520]  This is beyond politics, folks.
[42:57.520 --> 42:59.760]  This is a massive criminal enterprise.
[42:59.760 --> 43:05.400]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[43:05.400 --> 43:06.880]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[43:06.880 --> 43:12.760]  Well, it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew this was coming, I tried to stop it.
[43:12.760 --> 43:17.840]  And now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[43:17.840 --> 43:22.960]  the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents.
[43:22.960 --> 43:24.600]  It's now out in the open.
[43:24.600 --> 43:30.160]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[43:30.160 --> 43:31.160]  Group.
[43:31.160 --> 43:36.280]  So now the fight's out in the open, they're making their move because they know they're

[47:07.480 --> 47:22.680]  Well yesterday was Donald Trump's birthday and so James Kluge went out to ask people
[47:22.680 --> 47:27.600]  I believe this is in California how they would like to wish President Trump a happy birthday
[47:27.600 --> 47:34.360]  and it's pretty obvious here the dichotomy between a leftist and a non-leftist or rather
[47:34.360 --> 47:40.720]  a leftist and a sane person and it just it all flows here in this one video and in a
[47:40.720 --> 47:46.440]  short two minute video I think so much can be unpacked but here is James Kluge asking
[47:46.440 --> 47:57.960]  Californians what they would say to Trump on his birthday.
[47:57.960 --> 48:18.160]  I don't care what y'all gotta say Donald Trump is the best president yet you have more money
[48:18.160 --> 48:28.600]  in your pocket you have more money in your bank account, your thoughts on how things

[48:58.960 --> 49:04.360]  pretty gnarly is that that's we're gonna double down on that man he's a guy he's caused untold
[49:04.360 --> 49:08.360]  harm to our country he needs to go away and go to prison where he belongs I can't wait

[49:24.440 --> 49:36.200]  the establishment propaganda I did I can I can literally tell him to go do that exactly
[49:36.200 --> 49:42.200]  like what part of it the speech where did he what he said let's fight if you don't fight
[49:42.200 --> 49:46.120]  we're not gonna have a country anymore you mean the quote fight like hell oh yeah Bernie
[49:46.120 --> 49:50.440]  Sanders said that a lot of other Democrats said that and then when Trump say that in

[54:05.160 --> 54:11.000]  Rob do and others to discuss what happened at a recent drag queen story time event where
[54:11.000 --> 54:17.280]  some men went in and busted it up and forced the drag queen to leave the event we'll have
[54:17.280 --> 54:24.240]  that story coming up later in the meantime though what happens when liberal logic is
[54:24.240 --> 54:31.400]  put to the test it falls apart doesn't it because what do we say here if logic cannot
[54:31.400 --> 54:38.120]  be applied universally it's not logic it's propaganda if logic cannot be applied universally
[54:38.120 --> 54:44.840]  it's not logic it's propaganda here is a perfect example of that in clip nine when the abortion
[54:44.840 --> 54:49.480]  activists who chant my body my choice are out asked about the vaccine here's how it
[54:49.480 --> 54:54.200]  went in clip nine what's important is bodily autonomy the same right men have always had
[54:54.200 --> 54:58.440]  we just want equal rights the right to govern our own bodies just like men have always had
[54:58.440 --> 55:02.960]  she likes men doesn't she support the right for people to not get the covid vaccine it's
[55:02.960 --> 55:15.240]  irrelevant my body my choice it's not irrelevant one of them is going to be in a I don't know
[55:15.240 --> 55:22.840]  if there has ever been a more delusional response or moment and it happens all the time because
[55:22.840 --> 55:26.640]  you hear it all the time from the left it says my body my choice you bring up the vaccines
[55:26.640 --> 55:33.560]  well one of them is saving lives we're threatening me with a virus you're literally killing your
[55:33.560 --> 55:41.360]  child you're literally ending a human heartbeat you're literally ending a life I mean has liberal
[55:41.360 --> 55:46.960]  hypocrisy has liberal has liberalism as a mental disorder ever been more encapsulated
[55:46.960 --> 55:52.800]  into a tiny little moment then my body my choice and oh vaccine save lives as they literally
[55:52.800 --> 55:59.520]  end a life with their abortion I don't know if the hypocrisy and the mental illness of
[55:59.520 --> 56:04.320]  liberalism has ever been so encapsulated into a tiny ingestible pill as it is right there
[56:04.320 --> 56:10.760]  for your mind but okay guys rewind it and then just play that again right a state of
[56:10.760 --> 56:14.680]  emergency which we all know laws change during a state of emergency do you agree with the
[56:14.680 --> 56:19.960]  statement or the principle of my body my choice yes absolutely bodily autonomy is a human
[56:19.960 --> 56:25.600]  right health care is a human right access to health care should not be something that
[56:25.600 --> 56:29.360]  is dictated by the supreme court during the pandemic did you support people's right to
[56:29.360 --> 56:40.160]  not get the covid vaccine it's a difficult conversation you support body bodily autonomy
[56:40.160 --> 56:44.440]  in other situations for example the code he pause it pause it guys pause and rewind it
[56:44.440 --> 56:51.560]  15 seconds because again understand it's not logic unless it can be applied universally
[56:51.560 --> 56:55.960]  then it's propaganda so she just had that moment she realized wait a second my logic
[56:55.960 --> 57:01.520]  cannot be applied universally so how do I respond to this question you've been propagandized
[57:01.520 --> 57:06.760]  woman that's what we're trying to tell you all right finish the clip hated by the supreme
[57:06.760 --> 57:16.320]  court during the pandemic did you support people's right to not get the covid vaccine
[57:16.320 --> 57:21.360]  it's a difficult conversation you support body bodily autonomy in other situations for
[57:21.360 --> 57:26.920]  example the covid vaccine mandates vaccine mandates we've been mandated to get vaccines
[57:26.920 --> 57:30.480]  for years and years and years you do support in that situation people not having control
[57:30.480 --> 57:37.360]  of their bodies that's not that's not having not control of your body it's like I don't
[57:37.360 --> 57:41.920]  understand you think it is important for people to have medical and health control of their
[57:41.920 --> 57:50.000]  own body yeah it's good for them liberals you've been propagandized just admitted ladies and

[1:00:43.480 --> 1:00:50.320]  to anyone capable seeing past the mainstream media's hypnotic lies the numbers tell us
[1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:56.160]  that the vaccines have already caused a 20% increase in deaths now we have a run rate
[1:00:56.160 --> 1:01:02.280]  of about 20% excess mortality that's confirmed by the CDC numbers the funeral home numbers
[1:01:02.280 --> 1:01:06.440]  and the insurance company numbers and then somebody did an independent study I saw recently
[1:01:06.440 --> 1:01:11.840]  suggesting 20% the number so we're running a 20% excess deaths and a 10% increase in
[1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:16.560]  disabilities this is a stunning number you're telling me that things been flat for five
[1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:19.920]  years of 29 million and all of a sudden out of the data they got 3 million people are
[1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:26.040]  disabled out of nowhere and now we are beginning to understand that this is just the beginning
[1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:32.760]  things are going to get much much worse many of us have already seen the mysterious objects
[1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:39.240]  found in the vials of covid vaccines by two separate independent groups using electron
[1:01:39.240 --> 1:01:45.640]  microscopy we are also familiar with the rising number of strokes heart attacks and other
[1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:52.880]  side effects experienced worldwide after the biggest experimental vaccination in history
[1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:58.240]  and now we are getting a first glimpse of what is causing all this something in the
[1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:04.880]  covid vaccines seems to be growing within the recipients vascular system anomalous objects
[1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:11.320]  are being discovered in the dead bodies of the vaccinated by embalmers and coroners horrific
[1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:18.680]  things being grown inside the veins and arteries these are not blood clots and they appear to
[1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:25.880]  be some sort of organic material with small crystals and extremely thin wires made up
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:34.200]  of what looks like reptilian scales this internal blockage growing within the vaccinated would
[1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:40.520]  certainly explain all of the deadly side effects we are seeing today what the mainstream media
[1:02:40.520 --> 1:02:48.760]  is currently spinning as sudden adult death syndrome we do not know what these things are but they
[1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:56.120]  are being found by embalmers and coroners everywhere except pretty much all of them are too afraid
[1:02:56.120 --> 1:03:04.120]  to speak out or they don't care only one has shown the courage to speak out so far and this
[1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:11.880]  is the real tragedy for those who remain silent things will not get better the fda is poised to
[1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:19.400]  authorize these deadly vaccines to children as young as six months old and humanity does nothing
[1:03:19.960 --> 1:03:24.600]  today we want to provide an update on a topic that i know many parents and grandparents are
[1:03:24.600 --> 1:03:32.120]  focused on the potential for the first covid-19 vaccines for kids under five we have waited
[1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:36.920]  a long time for this moment well guys here's some good news the biden administration has
[1:03:36.920 --> 1:03:42.280]  finally announced a vaccine rollout plan for children under five and they've ordered 10 million
[1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:50.600]  doses that's great right now kids are like oh my gosh we could finally meet up for drinks
[1:03:52.200 --> 1:03:56.440]  yep as we speak everyone in the lollipop industry is like we're buying a yacht here we go
[1:03:56.440 --> 1:04:01.160]  you get a lollipop you get one it's very exciting to be here at four-year-old's cream facebook told
[1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:08.840]  me bill gates controls the vaccines okay why should we deserve anything other than pain and
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:15.720]  suffering if we do nothing to protect our own children once those afraid of speaking out begin
[1:04:15.720 --> 1:04:22.360]  seeing their coroner tables filled with dead children it will be too late but it's not too late
[1:04:22.360 --> 1:04:29.560]  now if you are an embalmer a coroner or a funeral director and you are seeing these things there is

[1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:12.840]  universe is this what planet did i wake up in so ladies and gentlemen unfortunately drag queen
[1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:18.120]  story time has been going on for years now but they've really kind of just dropped the story
[1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:23.720]  time from it and now it's just dance time strip time touch time for kids with all these perverts
[1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:30.280]  running around it's totally inappropriate it it should be illegal if it's not already and concerned
[1:10:30.280 --> 1:10:34.440]  parents all across the country realizing that this is going on in the schools and the libraries even
[1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:41.080]  in the churches sometimes and so rob do is with me in studio he's got a couple of kids he's concerned
[1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:46.840]  about this going on and you were in you were investigating a recent situation where there
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:52.680]  was a drag queen where parents showed up and actually forced the drag queen out of i guess it
[1:10:52.680 --> 1:10:58.440]  was a local library at the time so so talk about that story that you're going to be covering today
[1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:02.520]  and then more importantly though just as a parent that has multiple kids in school right now
[1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:08.600]  just how you're trying to make sure and monitor that your kids are not getting this propaganda
[1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:13.240]  when they go to school every day exactly and i'm going to show you how they say we have an agenda
[1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:17.480]  they admit it they have an agenda and then i'm going to show you examples of what the agenda is
[1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:23.800]  which is what we saw in that video um you know which is grown men laying down and having kids
[1:11:23.800 --> 1:11:28.760]  crawl on them and it's going to get worse obviously but what what caught my eye was the
[1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:35.080]  original headlines i saw proud boys members under hate crime investigation after shouting slurs at
[1:11:35.080 --> 1:11:39.640]  drag queen story hour that was that's from the hill so you can see that one there and then the
[1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:46.600]  washington post um proud boys disrupt drag queen reading event prompting hate crime probe and i've
[1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:51.880]  got some news articles going with that uh some some news packages that i put just a couple pieces
[1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:56.360]  i put together so people could see but it's interesting you go to the local cbs bay area
[1:11:56.360 --> 1:12:01.960]  and it says a group of men likely associated with the proud boys so here in national media
[1:12:01.960 --> 1:12:07.320]  they're being called proud boys but in the local media a group of men likely associated with so
[1:12:07.320 --> 1:12:11.000]  we don't even know if they're really proud boys and of course we've seen this trend before oh
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:14.600]  they are the proud boys oh they're associated with proud boys oh they have nothing to do with the
[1:12:14.600 --> 1:12:19.880]  proud boys so so who knows what the truth is but when this story first broke i remember seeing that
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:24.040]  that's what was published everywhere was proud boys proud boys proud boys and you never saw
[1:12:24.040 --> 1:12:29.400]  video with audio you just saw the guy making the ok symbol and well that's all we need to see
[1:12:29.400 --> 1:12:33.960]  another white supremacist problem and it's all about the demonization that's already happened
[1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:38.440]  with the proud boys and then furthering that uh demonization now whether this guy was involved
[1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:41.560]  with them or not i guess we still don't know maybe maybe you do know with your further
[1:12:41.560 --> 1:12:47.160]  investigations but what i what what's interesting to me is like oh oh so proud boys are the problem
[1:12:47.160 --> 1:12:54.360]  here not the pervert showing up to touch children right got it right and they had very much due cause
[1:12:54.360 --> 1:12:59.160]  to go after the specific drag queen performer that was at this specific library they went in
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:03.960]  there and they had they had video proof that they even show the librarian of what this drag queen
[1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:10.280]  does in her spare time and what she says on video and we're gonna get to that but but first i want
[1:13:10.280 --> 1:13:15.400]  to show you the propaganda we're gonna go to uh the news packages one a first i'm gonna show you
[1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:20.200]  how it was being shown to everybody in the world because then i found after i watched these then
[1:13:20.200 --> 1:13:26.440]  i saw the raw video from the men's perspective walking into the drag queen story like they had
[1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:31.000]  a point of view shot it's yeah it's their their cameras and they're talking completely different
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:36.040]  than what is being shown to you in these and then there's some associations they try to make in some
[1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:41.240]  of these news packages i put two of them together and let's roll the news packages uh clip investigators
[1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:47.240]  say the men shouted homophobic homophobic slurs at a drag queen who was trying to read to kids
[1:13:47.240 --> 1:13:53.800]  our doll and talk to that drag queen this time it felt very close to violence did you guys call
[1:13:53.800 --> 1:13:58.840]  the cop drag queen panadol says as these are some of the eight to ten men who walked into
[1:13:58.840 --> 1:14:05.080]  san lorenzo public library saturday afternoon to stop the book reading event it was extremely loud
[1:14:05.080 --> 1:14:10.280]  there was like cacophony of voices just yelling over one another taunting me calling me a groomer
[1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:16.360]  a pedophile a tranny and it um asking like interrogating the parents why are you bringing
[1:14:16.360 --> 1:14:21.400]  your kids to this sounds accurate so far because one of them was wearing a shirt with an ak47 on it
[1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:27.320]  and it said uh kill your local pedophile panadol said eventually he didn't like that to avoid direct
[1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:35.400]  confrontation he took that personally escalate the situation fear confusion alarm library staff say
[1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:39.560]  the men wouldn't leave and the rhetoric was escalating so they called the sheriff's office
[1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:44.600]  immediately we removed the performer from the room there's a nice face mask he comes back in later
[1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:49.240]  then we invited the parents so that ought to face mask on to exit the room as well but even after
[1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:53.640]  but even after going through all of that both the performer and the staff felt very strong about
[1:14:53.640 --> 1:14:58.520]  continuing with their reading event so they ended up covering up all of the open windows with
[1:14:58.520 --> 1:15:02.680]  anything they could find just to help the families feel more comfortable oh they don't want anyone
[1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:08.200]  seeing what they're doing it reminds me of the 2020 elections as well as an investigation into
[1:15:08.200 --> 1:15:13.480]  the annoying and harassing of children deputies want to assure the community that as people celebrate
[1:15:13.480 --> 1:15:18.360]  pride month deputies will be swift in their response to any threats toward this community
[1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:23.240]  in the night of the drag queen story our event a truck full of masked men believed to be part of
[1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:29.160]  a white nationalist was arrested in the park event they are charged which is a two different
[1:15:29.160 --> 1:15:33.240]  things to riot and by the way that was a that was a law enforcement that was a law enforcement

[1:20:22.040 --> 1:20:27.560]  drag is what america is all about she went on some drag queen show drag is what america is all about
[1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:31.240]  is she saying the founding fathers were drag queens is that what she's saying i'm not really
[1:20:31.240 --> 1:20:35.480]  sure she didn't think drag is what america is all about what drag racing i think she's confused
[1:20:35.480 --> 1:20:41.720]  in the powdered wigs with actually dressing up in makeup and performing vaudeville tunes drag is
[1:20:41.720 --> 1:20:47.240]  what america is all about says nancy polosi who's been in office for 700 years wow uh that tells
[1:20:47.240 --> 1:20:51.240]  you where their head is at and it's not a good place but you know i'm sitting here in the
[1:20:51.240 --> 1:20:57.320]  twilight zone with with rob do who's a concerned parent who's looking at all this uh drag queen
[1:20:57.320 --> 1:21:02.440]  story time which is targeting the children and it's just like how does somebody with a straight
[1:21:02.440 --> 1:21:09.560]  face do a news report on that and say that it's the men harassing children when it's a grown man
[1:21:09.560 --> 1:21:14.600]  dressed like a woman who's the one they're indoctrinating and harassing children to anybody
[1:21:14.600 --> 1:21:20.360]  else's rationally thinking point of view i mean i i'm just in total twilight zone land here why does
[1:21:20.360 --> 1:21:24.280]  this guy want to perform so badly in front of children i guess that would be my question
[1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:28.520]  why are you so desperate to perform in front of children yeah that's a great question actually
[1:21:28.520 --> 1:21:33.000]  because we see some of these guys have been convicted sex offenders that are in houston
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:36.520]  they found two of them at least uh and i don't think they do background checks on these people
[1:21:36.520 --> 1:21:40.440]  there's two of them here in austin they go yeah they go you want to be a uh you're a drag performer
[1:21:40.440 --> 1:21:45.560]  oh come on in touch the kids have fun bring up bring them in here and it's it's really disgusting
[1:21:45.560 --> 1:21:49.880]  and so just so everybody knows you can go find local heroes drive vile drag queen from
[1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:55.800]  library story our raw video uh on on band dot video uh it's been put up there so people can go watch
[1:21:56.680 --> 1:22:01.240]  everything of what we're put playing clips of but i i just want to go back to one thing they
[1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:05.000]  they try to associate these people with proud boys even though there may have been one guy
[1:22:05.560 --> 1:22:10.280]  wearing possibly a proud boy hat we don't even know um but here's the thing the reason they want
[1:22:10.280 --> 1:22:15.160]  to call them proud boys is uh here's an npr article from 2021 proud boys named terrorist entity in
[1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:19.400]  canada so they're they're trying to say if you're a proud boy you're a domestic terrorist anything
[1:22:19.400 --> 1:22:24.280]  you do is wrong and and and we can go at you full force so they want to use the full force of the
[1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:28.840]  law against anybody they call a proud boy anybody against the corporate government regime is now a
[1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:34.040]  domestic terrorist exactly and and so they don't like that but then we saw these patriot front
[1:22:34.040 --> 1:22:37.640]  guys i i looked at most of these guys who are in the library most of them didn't have i think
[1:22:37.640 --> 1:22:41.240]  may want one or two had masks on you look at the patriot front guys that were arrested which is why
[1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:46.280]  i wanted to bring those pictures up again is they all have their masks on still do you see any of
[1:22:46.280 --> 1:22:51.160]  them unmasked right there all the cops have there they don't have any masks on they have all have
[1:22:51.160 --> 1:22:56.680]  masks on and they and they're being left on after they've been uh detained and i think that's very
[1:22:56.680 --> 1:23:01.240]  weird and very telling sign of they don't want these people to be known they don't want photos of
[1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:04.920]  these people coming out they don't want any information they just want these people to be
[1:23:04.920 --> 1:23:09.080]  there for a photo op well i've got some news on that and i don't want to get into it now because
[1:23:09.080 --> 1:23:12.840]  i know we want to continue covering the drag stuff but but let's just say we'll come back on that
[1:23:12.840 --> 1:23:17.000]  story later maybe even with rob doing studio because i've got some news on that folks i haven't
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:21.480]  been covering this intentionally because i've known that something was gonna something there's
[1:23:21.480 --> 1:23:25.400]  gonna be a crack in that story oh it's gonna kind of open up to what the truth is i think we finally
[1:23:25.400 --> 1:23:29.320]  have it today but getting back to the uh put the pervert drag well and let's go we're gonna go back
[1:23:29.320 --> 1:23:33.960]  to the raw footage that that the young men who went in there to stop this event shot themselves
[1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:37.960]  it's from their point of view i found a the full thing is you can find that on band but here's
[1:23:37.960 --> 1:23:42.760]  this local i call local heroes clip one because i think these guys are heroes for stopping this
[1:23:42.760 --> 1:23:46.760]  especially when you see i'm going to show you in video two and i got to warn the parents you
[1:23:46.760 --> 1:23:51.160]  want to turn your kids away from what you're going to see in this next uh second video but

[1:25:27.800 --> 1:25:28.800]  yeah
[1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:30.800]  there's a pedophile here with children
[1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:32.800]  there's a trend going on overlooking
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:33.800]  this is disgusting
[1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:35.800]  what the hell is wrong with you people?
[1:25:35.800 --> 1:25:36.800]  these poor children
[1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:38.800]  what is wrong with you sick people?

[1:25:40.800 --> 1:25:41.800]  get out of here
[1:25:41.800 --> 1:25:42.800]  you're not safe here
[1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:43.800]  get out of here
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:46.800]  so I didn't see any harassment of children going on right there
[1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:47.800]  no
[1:25:47.800 --> 1:25:52.800]  well I'm sure there was before the guys disrupted the pedophile pervert
[1:25:52.800 --> 1:25:53.800]  it's my husband
[1:25:53.800 --> 1:25:55.800]  these poor children
[1:25:55.800 --> 1:25:57.800]  how dare you guys
[1:25:57.800 --> 1:25:59.800]  so that's just part of the
[1:25:59.800 --> 1:26:01.800]  they drive the pedophile from the story hour
[1:26:01.800 --> 1:26:03.800]  which to me is a heroic act
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:06.800]  and there's the security guard performing with the drag queen
[1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:08.800]  but notice
[1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:11.800]  everything they do has a sexual angle to it
[1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:12.800]  okay
[1:26:12.800 --> 1:26:17.800]  so the drag queen is dressed up like a baseball cheerleader
[1:26:17.800 --> 1:26:18.800]  like you notice that
[1:26:18.800 --> 1:26:21.800]  that's like this weird fetish, this weird fantasy
[1:26:21.800 --> 1:26:23.800]  I'm a baseball cheerleader
[1:26:23.800 --> 1:26:25.800]  and I mean I'll stop it right there
[1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:27.800]  but you know what she's thinking
[1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:29.800]  she's wanting to play with bats and balls
[1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:31.800]  turn away right now
[1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:34.800]  because I do show in this one clip
[1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:37.800]  a clip of what this drag queen performer puts out on video
[1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:38.800]  here it is
[1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:40.800]  you godless whores

[1:26:42.800 --> 1:26:44.800]  it's not okay
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:46.800]  you're not starting again
[1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:48.800]  this is over
[1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:50.800]  there's a librarian right there

[1:27:04.800 --> 1:27:06.800]  they do dress in as a female
[1:27:06.800 --> 1:27:09.800]  yeah so that's definitely a proud boy shirt there too
[1:27:09.800 --> 1:27:11.800]  so that's why they're saying they're proud
[1:27:11.800 --> 1:27:13.800]  do you know how many comedies are there
[1:27:13.800 --> 1:27:15.800]  you guys are sick
[1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:19.800]  we're just having fun
[1:27:19.800 --> 1:27:21.800]  I'm sure the pedophiles are having fun
[1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:23.800]  there is no enjoying children being abused
[1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:25.800]  so thank you, you can live
[1:27:25.800 --> 1:27:27.800]  we're here to protect the children
[1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:29.800]  because you won't
[1:27:34.800 --> 1:27:37.800]  poor Tranny can't read to the children
[1:27:43.800 --> 1:27:46.800]  so now they're showing the librarian the video
[1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:49.800]  right now I'm going to cut to it here in a second

[1:28:53.800 --> 1:28:55.800]  I mean there's all kinds of sexual innuendo there
[1:28:55.800 --> 1:28:57.800]  it's horrible
[1:28:57.800 --> 1:28:59.800]  there's an old Bedouin saying
[1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:01.800]  that's thousands of years old
[1:29:01.800 --> 1:29:03.800]  and it goes like this

[1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:07.800]  that tie up your camel
[1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:09.800]  Hunter S. Thompson put it this way
[1:29:09.800 --> 1:29:11.800]  pray to God but row away from the rocks
[1:29:11.800 --> 1:29:13.800]  if your boat is going towards the rocks
[1:29:13.800 --> 1:29:15.800]  pray to God that you don't get smashed on him and killed
[1:29:15.800 --> 1:29:17.800]  if you're not a row away
[1:29:17.800 --> 1:29:19.800]  you can't just sit there like a jellyfish
[1:29:19.800 --> 1:29:21.800]  and it's the same thing with our immune system

[1:31:27.800 --> 1:31:29.800]  and all the things out there hurting everybody
[1:31:29.800 --> 1:31:31.800]  to be able to do things tax wise
[1:31:31.800 --> 1:31:33.800]  it is legal and lawful
[1:31:33.800 --> 1:31:35.800]  that allows you to keep more money
[1:31:35.800 --> 1:31:37.800]  we would not even be here
[1:31:37.800 --> 1:31:39.800]  if I had not gotten great tax advice in the last few years
[1:31:39.800 --> 1:31:41.800]  the only way you fail
[1:31:41.800 --> 1:31:43.800]  is not writing down the URL
[1:31:43.800 --> 1:31:45.800]  jonestaxrelief.com
[1:31:45.800 --> 1:31:47.800]  one word, jonestaxrelief.com
[1:31:47.800 --> 1:31:57.800]  or call 833-904-285
[1:31:57.800 --> 1:31:59.800]  the globalist are bombarding us
[1:31:59.800 --> 1:32:01.800]  with propaganda
[1:32:01.800 --> 1:32:03.800]  and with spiritual warfare
[1:32:03.800 --> 1:32:05.800]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food
[1:32:05.800 --> 1:32:07.800]  it is all come out
[1:32:07.800 --> 1:32:09.800]  and they are doing that not because we are weak
[1:32:09.800 --> 1:32:11.800]  but because we are made the image of God
[1:32:11.800 --> 1:32:13.800]  the creator and we are powerful
[1:32:13.800 --> 1:32:15.800]  and the social engineers fear that so much
[1:32:15.800 --> 1:32:17.800]  so that is why I repeat that famous internet saying
[1:32:17.800 --> 1:32:19.800]  that nobody knows who first came up with
[1:32:19.800 --> 1:32:21.800]  the boy is it true
[1:32:21.800 --> 1:32:23.800]  the propaganda
[1:32:23.800 --> 1:32:25.800]  would not be necessary
[1:32:25.800 --> 1:32:27.800]  if the situation was hopeless
[1:32:27.800 --> 1:32:29.800]  they need all their propaganda
[1:32:29.800 --> 1:32:31.800]  and all their lies and all their evil
[1:32:31.800 --> 1:32:33.800]  and all their cultural death
[1:32:33.800 --> 1:32:35.800]  because they know
[1:32:35.800 --> 1:32:37.800]  we are strong
[1:32:37.800 --> 1:32:39.800]  and they know in the end they signed on
[1:32:39.800 --> 1:32:41.800]  the God of this world
[1:32:41.800 --> 1:32:43.800]  who is a loser
[1:32:43.800 --> 1:32:45.800]  and that is why it is so important that everybody keep
[1:32:45.800 --> 1:32:47.800]  them full wars in the air now more than ever
[1:32:47.800 --> 1:32:49.800]  because even if you don't believe in God
[1:32:49.800 --> 1:32:51.800]  what the globalist are manifesting and setting up
[1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:53.800]  is safe handling
[1:32:53.800 --> 1:32:55.800]  and we are opposing the one world government
[1:32:55.800 --> 1:33:23.800]  the mark of the beast they just announced
[1:33:23.800 --> 1:33:25.800]  before we went to the last break
[1:33:25.800 --> 1:33:27.800]  we were just showing this video on the screen
[1:33:27.800 --> 1:33:29.800]  it is a deranged
[1:33:29.800 --> 1:33:31.800]  perverted individual
[1:33:31.800 --> 1:33:33.800]  that if that man wants to do that
[1:33:33.800 --> 1:33:35.800]  in his own free time
[1:33:35.800 --> 1:33:37.800]  I would not care
[1:33:37.800 --> 1:33:39.800]  I would not notice I would have nothing to do with it
[1:33:39.800 --> 1:33:41.800]  but now that sexual
[1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:43.800]  deviant perverted man with all kind of sexual
[1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:45.800]  innuendo and just direct
[1:33:45.800 --> 1:33:47.800]  sex references in the little music video
[1:33:47.800 --> 1:33:49.800]  now performs
[1:33:49.800 --> 1:33:51.800]  for children they call it drag queen
[1:33:51.800 --> 1:33:53.800]  and you know Rob
[1:33:53.800 --> 1:33:55.800]  I think people are finally realizing how sick it is
[1:33:55.800 --> 1:33:57.800]  the debate is
[1:33:57.800 --> 1:33:59.800]  is it time
[1:33:59.800 --> 1:34:01.800]  to do good men and women have to stand up to put an end to this
[1:34:01.800 --> 1:34:03.800]  or do we just turn a blind eye
[1:34:03.800 --> 1:34:05.800]  and say look if these people want to groom
[1:34:05.800 --> 1:34:07.800]  and give their kids the pedophiles
[1:34:07.800 --> 1:34:09.800]  I guess we let them do it
[1:34:09.800 --> 1:34:11.800]  well those are the two choices
[1:34:11.800 --> 1:34:13.800]  I choose to follow
[1:34:13.800 --> 1:34:15.800]  what these local heroes did
[1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:17.800]  and go in and stand up for their community
[1:34:17.800 --> 1:34:19.800]  and just say no
[1:34:19.800 --> 1:34:21.800]  what they triggered them was the video we saw
[1:34:21.800 --> 1:34:23.800]  that video that
[1:34:23.800 --> 1:34:25.800]  that drag queen performer put out where she mouths the words
[1:34:25.800 --> 1:34:27.800]  hey kids who follow me can
[1:34:27.800 --> 1:34:29.800]  suck my ding dong
[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:31.800]  and by the way most of these drag queen performers
[1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:33.800]  folks you can go find
[1:34:33.800 --> 1:34:35.800]  pretty much very similar if not exact same content
[1:34:35.800 --> 1:34:37.800]  I mean we showed one time
[1:34:37.800 --> 1:34:39.800]  pulling a fake baby out of the oven
[1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:41.800]  like they were cooking a baby
[1:34:41.800 --> 1:34:43.800]  you know it's disgusting stuff
[1:34:43.800 --> 1:34:45.800]  and that's
[1:34:45.800 --> 1:34:47.800]  what goes on in their own private time whatever
[1:34:47.800 --> 1:34:49.800]  don't go bring it around kids
[1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:51.800]  don't be showing up to kids
[1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:53.800]  and I think this program is despicable
[1:34:53.800 --> 1:34:55.800]  now here's what the head of the
[1:34:55.800 --> 1:34:57.800]  I didn't even know there was an executive director
[1:34:57.800 --> 1:34:59.800]  of drag queen story are but there is
[1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:01.800]  his name is Jonathan Hamlet
[1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:03.800]  and he said any attempt to criminalize our work
[1:35:03.800 --> 1:35:05.800]  is rooted in tired homophobic and transphobic hate
[1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:07.800]  and misinformation
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:09.800]  we refuse to give into politicians who are too bigoted
[1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:11.800]  and boring to comprehend our vision
[1:35:11.800 --> 1:35:13.800]  for the world in which every child
[1:35:13.800 --> 1:35:15.800]  can safely
[1:35:15.800 --> 1:35:17.800]  express who they are
[1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:19.800]  you know I don't think that's ever been a problem Rob
[1:35:19.800 --> 1:35:21.800]  I don't think kids have a problem expressing themselves
[1:35:21.800 --> 1:35:23.800]  I don't think they need drag queen performers to go
[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:25.800]  them into doing what I think pedophiles getting access
[1:35:25.800 --> 1:35:27.800]  to kids that's the problem that's the shortages
[1:35:27.800 --> 1:35:29.800]  that they're trying to address that is the problem
[1:35:29.800 --> 1:35:31.800]  and we have some examples
[1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:33.800]  drag queen flashes
[1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:35.800]  young kids a drag queen story are this is from the post

[1:35:39.800 --> 1:35:41.800]  came up the last case I guess killing a pedophile
[1:35:41.800 --> 1:35:43.800]  or beating up a pedophile used to be
[1:35:43.800 --> 1:35:45.800]  a hero for doing that now the left
[1:35:45.800 --> 1:35:47.800]  now when I'm attacking so here's here's a drag queen
[1:35:47.800 --> 1:35:49.800]  performer flashing them here's

[1:36:11.800 --> 1:36:13.800]  okay I'm starting to see a bit
[1:36:13.800 --> 1:36:15.800]  of a
[1:36:15.800 --> 1:36:17.800]  pattern going on here that these people
[1:36:17.800 --> 1:36:19.800]  who want to be around kids have these
[1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:21.800]  perversions in them and then they make videos
[1:36:21.800 --> 1:36:23.800]  of it so what are we supposed to think we split
[1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:25.800]  oh that's nuance that's not nuance that's

[1:36:33.800 --> 1:36:35.800]  getting access to kids called miss kitty litter

[1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:15.800]  11
[1:37:15.800 --> 1:37:17.800]  priors

[1:37:33.800 --> 1:37:35.800]  they have these things in place
[1:37:35.800 --> 1:37:37.800]  I saw a graph the other day too
[1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:39.800]  they showed
[1:37:39.800 --> 1:37:41.800]  sexual abuse in schools from
[1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:43.800]  teachers and the numbers way up here
[1:37:43.800 --> 1:37:45.800]  per year of incidents and then they have they show
[1:37:45.800 --> 1:37:47.800]  the Catholic Church and it's like 210
[1:37:47.800 --> 1:37:49.800]  but it's like thousands in the public schools
[1:37:49.800 --> 1:37:51.800]  and they have a problem going on
[1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:53.800]  and you look at some of these lives of tiktok videos
[1:37:53.800 --> 1:37:55.800]  and you understand why and they think that some sort
[1:37:55.800 --> 1:37:57.800]  of like own or they're like oh really
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:37:59.800]  but the Catholic Church has pedophiles
[1:37:59.800 --> 1:38:01.800]  yeah we're against that too
[1:38:01.800 --> 1:38:03.800]  like what are you talking about everybody's against that
[1:38:03.800 --> 1:38:05.800]  exactly but what's going on
[1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:07.800]  it's not just at these drag queen story times
[1:38:07.800 --> 1:38:09.800]  it's going in on the universities
[1:38:09.800 --> 1:38:11.800]  here's ODU professor placed on
[1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:13.800]  administrative leave after comments on pedophilia
[1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:15.800]  said to use the term minor
[1:38:15.800 --> 1:38:17.800]  attracted person instead of pedophile
[1:38:17.800 --> 1:38:19.800]  so we're going to say it's okay
[1:38:19.800 --> 1:38:21.800]  essentially that this person likes kids
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:23.800]  he's a minor attracted person
[1:38:23.800 --> 1:38:25.800]  yeah maps is what they call him and this
[1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:27.800]  it kind of brought me back to that I'm not convinced
[1:38:27.800 --> 1:38:29.800]  it just made me think but remember the wiki leeks
[1:38:29.800 --> 1:38:31.800]  emails the democrat wiki
[1:38:31.800 --> 1:38:33.800]  leeks emails pedestrian others
[1:38:33.800 --> 1:38:35.800]  where they talked about maps
[1:38:35.800 --> 1:38:37.800]  related maps and almond maps and stuff like that
[1:38:37.800 --> 1:38:39.800]  we all thought it was like actually like a map
[1:38:39.800 --> 1:38:41.800]  you'd like to find a good area
[1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:43.800]  maybe it was something else
[1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:45.800]  maybe it was a different manner I don't know
[1:38:45.800 --> 1:38:47.800]  we never got any answers investigations into that
[1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:49.800]  we see this professor was doing this
[1:38:49.800 --> 1:38:51.800]  here's another one queer ethics professor calls for pedophilia
[1:38:51.800 --> 1:38:53.800]  to be destigmatized and taught in schools
[1:38:53.800 --> 1:38:55.800]  destigmatized
[1:38:55.800 --> 1:38:57.800]  and taught in schools pedophilia
[1:38:57.800 --> 1:38:59.800]  furious
[1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:01.800]  for your own courage to touch naked man
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:03.800]  at art exhibition
[1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:05.800]  there's the queer ethics professor again but here's the other one
[1:39:05.800 --> 1:39:07.800]  is that the one where he's bending over
[1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:09.800]  no I don't
[1:39:09.800 --> 1:39:11.800]  I almost can't even believe that
[1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:13.800]  that one that I saw I did a reverse image search I can't even
[1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:15.800]  find where it is but here from
[1:39:15.800 --> 1:39:17.800]  where it is that I think they're trying to erase that image
[1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:19.800]  but we're going to show that later and it's truly disturbing
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:21.800]  but here's a professor from New York
[1:39:21.800 --> 1:39:23.800]  this is a video it's a mistake to think
[1:39:23.800 --> 1:39:25.800]  pedophilia is wrong this is a professor
[1:39:25.800 --> 1:39:27.800]  a paid professor in New York is stating this
[1:39:27.800 --> 1:39:29.800]  on video publicly
[1:39:29.800 --> 1:39:31.800]  for the world to see so this is clip number four
[1:39:31.800 --> 1:39:33.800]  imagine that
[1:39:33.800 --> 1:39:35.800]  an adult male
[1:39:35.800 --> 1:39:37.800]  wants to have sex with a 12 year old girl
[1:39:37.800 --> 1:39:39.800]  imagine that she's a willing participant
[1:39:39.800 --> 1:39:41.800]  a very standard very widely held view
[1:39:41.800 --> 1:39:43.800]  that there's something deeply wrong about this
[1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:45.800]  and it's wrong independent of it being
[1:39:45.800 --> 1:39:47.800]  criminalized
[1:39:47.800 --> 1:39:49.800]  it's not obvious to me that is in fact wrong
[1:39:49.800 --> 1:39:51.800]  I think this is a mistake and I think
[1:39:51.800 --> 1:39:53.800]  that exploring why it's a mistake
[1:39:53.800 --> 1:39:55.800]  will tell us not only things
[1:39:55.800 --> 1:39:57.800]  about adult child sex and statutory
[1:39:57.800 --> 1:39:59.800]  rape but also about fundamental
[1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:01.800]  principles of morality
[1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:03.800]  that is so disgusting I can't even believe it
[1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:05.800]  it's ridiculous and
[1:40:05.800 --> 1:40:07.800]  you know remember the gay men's choir they were saying
[1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:09.800]  we're coming for your children we're coming for your children
[1:40:09.800 --> 1:40:11.800]  we saw videos of
[1:40:11.800 --> 1:40:13.800]  the drag queen performer in the
[1:40:13.800 --> 1:40:15.800]  city council meetings that we have an agenda
[1:40:15.800 --> 1:40:17.800]  we're coming for it it's about grooming the next
[1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:19.800]  generation I think is what he said those are the exact words
[1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:21.800]  well so they
[1:40:21.800 --> 1:40:23.800]  they got death threats after they put out a video saying
[1:40:23.800 --> 1:40:25.800]  we're coming for your children we're coming for your children
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:27.800]  people didn't like that oh oh we
[1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:29.800]  can't be against this
[1:40:29.800 --> 1:40:31.800]  we have to just accept this of them
[1:40:31.800 --> 1:40:33.800]  saying we're coming for your children and then they
[1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:35.800]  admit and they go oh
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:37.800]  this song is tongue in cheek it's satirical but we
[1:40:37.800 --> 1:40:39.800]  do have a gay agenda we do
[1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:41.800]  have they admit they do have a gay agenda
[1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:43.800]  and they're say oh it's just to make them
[1:40:43.800 --> 1:40:45.800]  tolerant just to make these kids tolerant
[1:40:45.800 --> 1:40:47.800]  I don't know what
[1:40:47.800 --> 1:40:49.800]  I don't know what world this is where
[1:40:49.800 --> 1:40:51.800]  in order to show this tolerance you have
[1:40:51.800 --> 1:40:53.800]  to let your kids go up
[1:40:53.800 --> 1:40:55.800]  to these drag queen performers and roll on them
[1:40:55.800 --> 1:40:57.800]  and to sacrifice it's like a sacrifice to
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:40:59.800]  Molok and they think oh I'm gonna
[1:40:59.800 --> 1:41:01.800]  sacrifice my kids on the author of tolerance that's
[1:41:01.800 --> 1:41:03.800]  really what's going on and it it's
[1:41:03.800 --> 1:41:05.800]  truly truly disgusting and shame on
[1:41:05.800 --> 1:41:07.800]  these parents for doing this shame on these schools
[1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:09.800]  for letting these teachers still
[1:41:09.800 --> 1:41:11.800]  work I mean you
[1:41:11.800 --> 1:41:13.800]  that's totally just insanity hope that goes
[1:41:13.800 --> 1:41:15.800]  straight into hell
[1:41:15.800 --> 1:41:17.800]  it's a mad world it's a mad world I can't
[1:41:17.800 --> 1:41:19.800]  believe it's going on and I can't believe
[1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:21.800]  it either and here and then and then you have
[1:41:21.800 --> 1:41:23.800]  this kind of ties in with the
[1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:25.800]  proud boys being the domestic terrorists
[1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:27.800]  in in Canada well Greg
[1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:29.800]  stube put out a he's a congressman representative
[1:41:29.800 --> 1:41:31.800]  he said hey secretary
[1:41:31.800 --> 1:41:33.800]  my orchestin a g garland found some domestic
[1:41:33.800 --> 1:41:35.800]  terrorists for you and it's a dc called action
[1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:37.800]  night of rage and it says on
[1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:39.800]  there you said you'd riot hit the streets
[1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:41.800]  so who are these people are they being
[1:41:41.800 --> 1:41:43.800]  investigated they're calling
[1:41:43.800 --> 1:41:45.800]  for a riot over the row versus
[1:41:45.800 --> 1:41:47.800]  way decision but are we going to see
[1:41:47.800 --> 1:41:49.800]  any investigation are we going to see any arrest
[1:41:49.800 --> 1:41:51.800]  no we're not going to see anything because they're allowed
[1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:53.800]  to do this no there's a group are allowed
[1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:55.800]  to go and touch kids and do these types
[1:41:55.800 --> 1:41:57.800]  of things and in riot
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:41:59.800]  and some people if they go stop it
[1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:01.800]  oh no they're they're getting investigated for a hate crime
[1:42:01.800 --> 1:42:03.800]  remember they would share that picture of
[1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:05.800]  Donald Trump with Ivanka on his lap
[1:42:05.800 --> 1:42:07.800]  oh yeah and they'd say look how inappropriate look
[1:42:07.800 --> 1:42:09.800]  how perverted right okay maybe
[1:42:09.800 --> 1:42:11.800]  you know I probably wouldn't take a picture like that but
[1:42:11.800 --> 1:42:13.800]  well let me show you something that's inappropriate
[1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:15.800]  yeah oh let's look at this this is
[1:42:15.800 --> 1:42:17.800]  at a museum and I can't even this thing has been excised
[1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:19.800]  off the internet so I can't even believe
[1:42:19.800 --> 1:42:21.800]  this after this video
[1:42:21.800 --> 1:42:23.800]  went up there like this is so vile
[1:42:23.800 --> 1:42:25.800]  this is a young kid
[1:42:25.800 --> 1:42:27.800]  painting a man's butt
[1:42:27.800 --> 1:42:29.800]  and this is going on somewhere in America
[1:42:29.800 --> 1:42:31.800]  I did a reverse image search I couldn't find
[1:42:31.800 --> 1:42:33.800]  any matches for it but this
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:35.800]  is the disgusting this that's going on
[1:42:35.800 --> 1:42:37.800]  and if you think this is okay and obviously there's
[1:42:37.800 --> 1:42:39.800]  adults here that think this is cool and there's other kids
[1:42:39.800 --> 1:42:41.800]  watching oh look he's touching the man's butt with a paintbrush
[1:42:41.800 --> 1:42:43.800]  this is wrong
[1:42:43.800 --> 1:42:45.800]  it's wrong on so many levels
[1:42:45.800 --> 1:42:47.800]  I can't even describe
[1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:49.800]  you how wrong this is and how you're damaging
[1:42:49.800 --> 1:42:51.800]  these children and its child abuse
[1:42:51.800 --> 1:42:53.800]  at the hundredth level
[1:42:53.800 --> 1:43:15.800]  and it's totally sick
[1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:25.800]  and love
[1:43:25.800 --> 1:43:27.800]  my friends the enemies coming after me
[1:43:27.800 --> 1:43:29.800]  not because I'm a loser but because I'm a winner
[1:43:29.800 --> 1:43:31.800]  they're coming after you
[1:43:31.800 --> 1:43:33.800]  not because you're a bad person
[1:43:33.800 --> 1:43:35.800]  because you're a good person
[1:43:35.800 --> 1:43:37.800]  because you love God and God loves you

[1:45:49.800 --> 1:45:51.800]  momento that keeps us on air
[1:45:51.800 --> 1:45:53.800]  at infowarstore.com
[1:45:53.800 --> 1:45:55.800]  or 1776coin.com
[1:45:55.800 --> 1:45:57.800]  while you still can
[1:45:57.800 --> 1:45:59.800]  you know its going back to what we all thought
[1:45:59.800 --> 1:46:01.800]  was going to happen in the 90s when the internet
[1:46:01.800 --> 1:46:03.800]  and mobile technology first came out
[1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:05.800]  which is we thought this is going to level the playing field
[1:46:05.800 --> 1:46:07.800]  everybody is going to have access to the same information
[1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:09.800]  and everybody is going to be able to freely communicate
[1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:11.800]  that information
[1:46:11.800 --> 1:46:13.800]  and this is our goal
[1:46:13.800 --> 1:46:15.800]  to get back to that place
[1:46:15.800 --> 1:46:17.800]  where we all have access to all of the information
[1:46:17.800 --> 1:46:19.800]  we all have the ability
[1:46:19.800 --> 1:46:21.800]  to freely communicate that information
[1:46:21.800 --> 1:46:23.800]  with whomever we want
[1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:25.800]  whenever we want
[1:46:25.800 --> 1:46:27.800]  and we don't have to worry about anybody
[1:46:27.800 --> 1:46:29.800]  tracking what we are doing
[1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:31.800]  and trying to judge us
[1:46:31.800 --> 1:46:33.800]  or categorize us
[1:46:33.800 --> 1:46:35.800]  or figure out some way to go after us
[1:46:35.800 --> 1:46:37.800]  because of the conversations we are having
[1:46:37.800 --> 1:46:39.800]  because of the internet searches that we are doing
[1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:41.800]  and the people we want to talk to about these things
[1:46:41.800 --> 1:46:43.800]  so that is our goal
[1:46:43.800 --> 1:46:45.800]  is to help people take back their freedom
[1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:47.800]  by helping them to take back their privacy
[1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:49.800]  and so that is really what we are trying to do
[1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:51.800]  and so I hope
[1:46:51.800 --> 1:46:53.800]  that everybody listening
[1:46:53.800 --> 1:46:55.800]  will check us out at

[1:48:08.400 --> 1:48:12.960]  were one she interviews uh... the swimmer who competed against lea thomas
[1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:14.400]  competing as demand

[1:48:17.940 --> 1:48:19.040]  all what a surprise
[1:48:19.040 --> 1:48:20.740]  and then the the third video
[1:48:20.740 --> 1:48:25.480]  just happened uh... last weekend i guess at a gay pride event
[1:48:25.480 --> 1:48:28.920]  i'm i'm pretty sure it's a man with boobs are maybe it's a female boobs i can't
[1:48:28.920 --> 1:48:29.760]  really tell
[1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:32.200]  exposes her but to a crowd
[1:48:32.200 --> 1:48:35.600]  uh... and shakes it works for it and there's kids everywhere it's totally
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:39.120]  discovered so it's uh... that picture right there this is put by the way this
[1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:42.680]  police officer i feel so bad for this police officer yeah that police officer
[1:48:42.680 --> 1:48:47.480]  should have arrested that thing right on site and probably given it feted a
[1:48:47.480 --> 1:48:51.640]  little pavement to i mean that's assault you go to somebody you rub your ass on
[1:48:51.640 --> 1:48:55.520]  them that is assault it's disgusting so i kind of wanted with it this is where
[1:48:55.520 --> 1:48:58.920]  it's all going censorship if you speak out against this hate crime if you speak
[1:48:58.920 --> 1:49:02.480]  out against this it's all coming out so we all have to stand decide that we're
[1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:05.440]  not going to stand for this stuff and all stand up together or we're all
[1:49:05.440 --> 1:49:08.040]  going to fall individually so here's a savannah's video
[1:49:08.040 --> 1:49:10.160]  learn why this journalist is banned from twitter
[1:49:10.160 --> 1:49:13.600]  my name is savannah hernandez and i have been baselessly banned from twitter
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:16.160]  three times after breaking national news
[1:49:16.160 --> 1:49:18.680]  in twenty twenty when i was a twenty three-year-old journalist with a
[1:49:18.680 --> 1:49:21.080]  twitter following of a hundred and twenty two k
[1:49:21.080 --> 1:49:24.640]  former president donald trump retweeted my footage of americans peacefully
[1:49:24.640 --> 1:49:26.520]  singing the national anthem
[1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:29.880]  that retweet resulted in almost ten million views in one week later
[1:49:29.880 --> 1:49:31.280]  my entire account
[1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:33.800]  which had never had any prior suspensions and warnings
[1:49:33.800 --> 1:49:35.400]  was permanently deleted
[1:49:35.400 --> 1:49:38.240]  twitter didn't immediately tell me why my account was suspended
[1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:41.520]  and one month later they finally emailed saying that i had broken their rule on
[1:49:41.520 --> 1:49:42.960]  ban evasion
[1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:45.200]  however this is my only account
[1:49:45.200 --> 1:49:48.840]  i have a podcast so i decided in twenty twenty to start a twitter account for my
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:49.720]  show
[1:49:49.720 --> 1:49:52.440]  and then of course began using the account to document my on the ground
[1:49:52.440 --> 1:49:53.560]  reporting
[1:49:53.560 --> 1:49:56.880]  during the twenty twenty two nc double a women's swimming championships
[1:49:56.880 --> 1:49:59.960]  i interviewed the one athlete that was willing to speak out against leah
[1:49:59.960 --> 1:50:00.680]  thomas
[1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:02.960]  the transgender athlete that was competing
[1:50:02.960 --> 1:50:05.960]  this interview went viral garnering almost three million views and made
[1:50:05.960 --> 1:50:07.560]  tucker carlson's show
[1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:11.640]  two days later the account was suspended for yet again ban evasion
[1:50:11.640 --> 1:50:15.440]  i decided to make another account since the original excuse of ban evasion was
[1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:18.560]  baseless and no one at twitter has responded to any of my request for an
[1:50:18.560 --> 1:50:19.560]  appeal
[1:50:19.560 --> 1:50:23.080]  this morning my third account was deleted once again after three separate
[1:50:23.080 --> 1:50:26.360]  videos i put out this past week made national news
[1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:30.400]  i went out and i asked black americans if the economy was really doing as well
[1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:32.240]  as joe biden has been saying
[1:50:32.240 --> 1:50:36.400]  i then went to dc pride and captured a new trans person twerking in front of
[1:50:36.400 --> 1:50:37.400]  kids
[1:50:37.400 --> 1:50:41.280]  finally i interviewed members of the pride community regarding their pronouns
[1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:44.960]  across twitter these clips were seen over four million times and when i woke
[1:50:44.960 --> 1:50:48.320]  up this morning my account was once again suspended
[1:50:48.320 --> 1:50:51.560]  this is the third time that twitter is silenced me for breaking national news
[1:50:51.560 --> 1:50:54.840]  and countering what the mainstream media and government are reporting to us
[1:50:54.840 --> 1:50:58.040]  i'm an independent reporter that has been on the ground to cover events such
[1:50:58.040 --> 1:51:02.120]  as the blm riots of twenty twenty the texas border crisis the san francisco
[1:51:02.120 --> 1:51:06.720]  fentanyl crisis homelessness in downtown l.a. and even january sixth
[1:51:06.720 --> 1:51:10.280]  my only goal has been to highlight the issues voices and on the ground coverage
[1:51:10.280 --> 1:51:12.960]  the mainstream media continues to silence and cover up
[1:51:12.960 --> 1:51:16.440]  and for that i have been censored targeted and effectively deleted from
[1:51:16.440 --> 1:51:18.960]  history so please help me spread this message
[1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:22.640]  because two years multiple breaking news stories and three twitter accounts
[1:51:22.640 --> 1:51:27.160]  later i still have never received an answer as to why i was and continue to
[1:51:27.160 --> 1:51:29.960]  be baselessly banned on twitter's platform
[1:51:29.960 --> 1:51:32.960]  and of course we give savannah nana's a platform at band out video that's why
[1:51:32.960 --> 1:51:36.040]  info wars is so important so that we can give a platform to other people but
[1:51:36.040 --> 1:51:38.480]  rob here's what i take away from this
[1:51:38.480 --> 1:51:42.080]  they want to be able to abuse children they just don't want you to know about
[1:51:42.080 --> 1:51:42.840]  it right
[1:51:42.840 --> 1:51:45.880]  they don't want regular people out there to see what's going on
[1:51:45.880 --> 1:51:47.160]  and so they hide it
[1:51:47.160 --> 1:51:51.440]  behind closed doors they hide it behind papered windows they hide it under the
[1:51:51.440 --> 1:51:53.000]  guys of tolerance
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:56.720]  and if you don't agree with it then you're the bad person all the sudden
[1:51:56.720 --> 1:52:00.280]  there's no debate about whether it's good enough for the community they just do it
[1:52:00.280 --> 1:52:03.680]  that library just goes we're gonna do this because libraries are probably run
[1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:06.600]  more often than not by liberal left-leaning people may even be
[1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:07.460]  telling right
[1:52:07.460 --> 1:52:09.800]  let's have these people come in they don't do any background checks they
[1:52:09.800 --> 1:52:11.720]  admit it they don't do it
[1:52:11.720 --> 1:52:15.320]  and so they let these people come in who want to get near kids and there's a
[1:52:15.320 --> 1:52:18.120]  reason why they want to get your kids and i think we've documented it many
[1:52:18.120 --> 1:52:19.360]  times over
[1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:20.940]  throughout the years
[1:52:20.940 --> 1:52:24.680]  yeah and you can see in some of the videos that we play just over the
[1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:28.360]  years yeah they invite the kids they crawl on them they rub their bellies
[1:52:28.360 --> 1:52:31.680]  they tell them to shake their butts and bend over and all this weird stuff i
[1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:32.720]  mean it's it's just
[1:52:32.720 --> 1:52:34.520]  it's totally sick stuff
[1:52:34.520 --> 1:52:36.960]  i mean that's why it's just total twilight zone to me
[1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:40.000]  it's like how is this even going on
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:43.680]  and then how are you the bad guy if you say it shouldn't be
[1:52:43.680 --> 1:52:48.000]  i don't want to have a twilight zone episode of my end
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:52.120]  i have no idea i have no idea how i got this bad but since uh... i guess drag
[1:52:52.120 --> 1:52:55.120]  queen story i started in twenty fifteen so seven years there you go
[1:52:55.120 --> 1:52:57.560]  uh... we all need a little bleach our eyes after
[1:52:57.560 --> 1:53:01.680]  after these uh... this hour yikes here's some more of it
[1:53:01.680 --> 1:53:04.920]  put a bow on this now if you can and i say gay bow
[1:53:04.920 --> 1:53:09.440]  pride and sanity mom forces unwilling child to watch gay festivities as he
[1:53:09.440 --> 1:53:13.160]  recalls and horror i'm seeing a lot of that by the way and and the other thing
[1:53:13.160 --> 1:53:15.360]  that i've noticed to rob
[1:53:15.360 --> 1:53:18.920]  is when you're watching footage of these uh... you know these gay parades that
[1:53:18.920 --> 1:53:21.800]  have now just turned into sexual deviant parades
[1:53:21.800 --> 1:53:24.480]  gone from gay pride parade to sexual deviant parade
[1:53:24.480 --> 1:53:28.040]  i noticed that the kids that are in the parade aren't smiling aren't happy don't
[1:53:28.040 --> 1:53:29.280]  look like they're having fun
[1:53:29.280 --> 1:53:32.360]  the kids that are in the audience aren't happy are fighting with their parents
[1:53:32.360 --> 1:53:33.600]  their parents are pushing yeah
[1:53:33.600 --> 1:53:34.560]  like you remember
[1:53:34.560 --> 1:53:37.440]  i remember some of the things that i used to do as a kid we may have a fourth
[1:53:37.440 --> 1:53:41.200]  of july parade and we'd have puppies and maybe blow bubbles and they throw
[1:53:41.200 --> 1:53:45.560]  candy and there'd be hula hoops and sparklers all the kids had fun
[1:53:45.560 --> 1:53:49.560]  we'd have local fairs with maybe little carnival rides and carnival games and
[1:53:49.560 --> 1:53:51.680]  guess what the kids had fun
[1:53:51.680 --> 1:53:53.800]  i don't see any kids having fun at this stuff
[1:53:53.800 --> 1:53:56.040]  and they say oh it's for kids no it's not it's for you
[1:53:56.040 --> 1:53:59.600]  it's for you sexual deviance for you so you can get close to kids and touch them
[1:53:59.600 --> 1:54:01.800]  and rub and desensitize them
[1:54:01.800 --> 1:54:03.160]  to this type of stuff
[1:54:03.160 --> 1:54:06.160]  and then they go oh i want to be like an adult so i'm gonna repeat it then you
[1:54:06.160 --> 1:54:09.280]  got people like desmond is amazing running around in strip clubs getting
[1:54:09.280 --> 1:54:10.000]  tips
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:13.120]  and there's a kid who doesn't want to watch it he
[1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:15.240]  he's like leave me alone i don't like this
[1:54:15.240 --> 1:54:17.880]  the kids having a natural reaction
[1:54:17.880 --> 1:54:20.040]  hey this is adult stuff

[1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:25.600]  i have an instinct not to want to see this crap
[1:54:25.600 --> 1:54:29.040]  now it gets it it's ridiculous and there's a picture to a young
[1:54:29.040 --> 1:54:32.560]  to young boy going and it's all over the internet there's like this old

[1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:44.960]  doing this to our children we need to stop it we need to speak out against it
[1:54:44.960 --> 1:54:47.320]  and don't let it happen in your school when it's happening in your school don't
[1:54:47.320 --> 1:54:48.480]  just pull your kids out
[1:54:48.480 --> 1:54:51.520]  get some other parents and say hey do we want this going on
[1:54:51.520 --> 1:54:54.880]  panda dulce panda is a nickname for little kids
[1:54:54.880 --> 1:54:55.920]  who have been
[1:54:55.920 --> 1:54:59.000]  they have black eyes and there's a reason from that and it's
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:01.080]  kind of do disgusting even talk about

[1:55:18.720 --> 1:55:19.520]  by the way
[1:55:19.520 --> 1:55:23.400]  holy crap I mean seriously let's say you had a bunch of strippers
[1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:27.320]  male and female strippers doing parades heterosexual pride parades and they were
[1:55:27.320 --> 1:55:29.800]  running around half naked grinding on each other
[1:55:29.800 --> 1:55:33.680]  dry humping the air dry humping the ground of course that would be inappropriate for
[1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:34.280]  kids
[1:55:34.280 --> 1:55:37.640]  yeah of course that's not happening it's ridiculous
[1:55:37.640 --> 1:55:40.760]  alright but here's there's more abuse to this Rob actually there's actually
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:44.760]  there's another side of the abuse here study contradicts transgender
[1:55:44.760 --> 1:55:45.320]  narrative
[1:55:45.320 --> 1:55:49.000]  suggest puberty blockers spike youth suicide they say oh no
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:52.160]  no it's good for the kids no it's not at all it's bad for them
[1:55:52.160 --> 1:55:56.200]  new heritage foundation study youth suicide rates are significantly higher
[1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:59.920]  in states where puberty blockers trans drugs are accessible for children
[1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:03.400]  and then there is another censorship of a an account on Twitter
[1:56:03.400 --> 1:56:07.920]  a 35-year-old de-transitioned European man named Richie
[1:56:07.920 --> 1:56:11.240]  who did a a breakdown of his own
[1:56:11.240 --> 1:56:15.800]  transition de-transition no one told me any of what I'm going to tell you now
[1:56:15.800 --> 1:56:19.720]  it was a long thread on Twitter de-transitioned man shares grim details
[1:56:19.720 --> 1:56:20.760]  of trans surgeries
[1:56:20.760 --> 1:56:25.480]  a lot of stuff in there I I I didn't even know about and it's horrific sad
[1:56:25.480 --> 1:56:28.200]  stuff that they promote this lifestyle the kids that's
[1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:32.600]  so degenerative and unhealthy let kids be kids
[1:56:32.600 --> 1:56:36.440]  let's let them be kids they don't let them play in the park and play ball and
[1:56:36.440 --> 1:56:36.880]  and
[1:56:36.880 --> 1:56:40.160]  climb on jungle gyms there's a time when kids need to grow up
[1:56:40.160 --> 1:56:44.400]  and and and that's when they're young adults these are young
[1:56:44.400 --> 1:56:47.360]  kids and they're putting them into a process
[1:56:47.360 --> 1:56:50.400]  where they're there and they're being groomed without a doubt
[1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:54.080]  to accept grown men in makeup touching them
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:57.360]  that's where it is and it's gonna get worse from there and and if you don't
[1:56:57.360 --> 1:56:58.520]  speak out against it
[1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:02.720]  your kids are gonna be next so you've been warned I hate to do this
[1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:05.800]  but it needs to be said it needs to be shown
[1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:09.480]  people need to know what's really going on and so you're informed when they go
[1:57:09.480 --> 1:57:11.040]  oh we're just having fun
[1:57:11.040 --> 1:57:15.640]  no they're not having fun that's not fun
[1:57:15.640 --> 1:57:20.280]  that's degenerate and by the way it's it's well known as a characteristic of
[1:57:20.280 --> 1:57:23.640]  potential serial killers that they'll abuse and torture animals
[1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:26.360]  just like that you've all day shooter was killing cats
[1:57:26.360 --> 1:57:31.240]  this is the same thing for sex folks if they can get kids to be desensitized
[1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:34.680]  and and programmed into the sexual deviancy at a young age
[1:57:34.680 --> 1:57:38.760]  they'll be they'll be more inclined to be deviance and perverts at the next age
[1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:41.960]  so the rest of these freaks will feel like they're just blending in
[1:57:41.960 --> 1:57:45.080]  as they're grooming the next generation of degenerate perverts

[1:59:53.800 --> 1:59:57.240]  it's alex jones
[2:00:04.680 --> 2:00:09.320]  so this patriot front story is a weird thing and rob do and i were just kind
[2:00:09.320 --> 2:00:13.400]  of discussing some of the oddities but but folks this is the latest oddity
[2:00:13.400 --> 2:00:16.920]  we know about fbi running events like the the michigan
[2:00:16.920 --> 2:00:20.680]  plot to kidnap the governor that was all fbi run fbi led
[2:00:20.680 --> 2:00:24.360]  that all came out in court uh same fbi agent that ran that was running the
[2:00:24.360 --> 2:00:27.640]  january 6th events as well that's not a coincidence folks so
[2:00:27.640 --> 2:00:31.640]  same story there most likely and and now maybe we have the same thing
[2:00:31.640 --> 2:00:35.720]  happening here with the patriot front i want to play this clip and get rob
[2:00:35.720 --> 2:00:39.160]  do's take what does one police say they have
[2:00:39.160 --> 2:00:42.840]  informants embedded in the patriot front and then the police running the
[2:00:42.840 --> 2:00:49.960]  press conference deny that here that is in clip eight
[2:00:49.960 --> 2:00:54.440]  i'm sorry just a follow-up question on that sir um are you with the media sir
[2:00:54.440 --> 2:00:57.960]  i'm not i'm a citizen okay i'm gonna ask the media questions you're
[2:00:57.960 --> 2:01:01.240]  first the police chief was taking questions today at a press conference
[2:01:01.240 --> 2:01:05.400]  in cordilline idaho and he was blindsided by a citizen journalist
[2:01:05.400 --> 2:01:10.680]  sitting amongst the corporate press there was an officer of yours that was
[2:01:10.680 --> 2:01:16.040]  film stating that there was information and embedded
[2:01:16.040 --> 2:01:19.800]  feds or informants within that group is there any
[2:01:19.800 --> 2:01:23.960]  veracity that it was an officer of yours that made that
[2:01:23.960 --> 2:01:27.080]  statement on the scene no i think you're completely mistaken
[2:01:27.080 --> 2:01:30.200]  33 people went up and i think you're completely mistaken i didn't say it was
[2:01:30.200 --> 2:01:33.960]  wrong do you know what the original stop was for
[2:01:33.960 --> 2:01:41.000]  for that but how did you know how did you know that we have you nice
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:45.320]  yep yes very good it's out here there's somebody inside that group that's
[2:01:45.320 --> 2:01:47.720]  calling us there's somebody inside that group that's calling us
[2:01:47.720 --> 2:01:51.640]  these were not antifa in disguise nor were they fbi members in disguise you're
[2:01:51.640 --> 2:01:56.120]  making the statement one way and this video isn't something that was been
[2:01:56.120 --> 2:02:01.400]  ginned up in some conspiracy matter it's actually someone who videoed an officer
[2:02:01.400 --> 2:02:04.360]  of yours on the scene hang on since this is a press conference
[2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:07.000]  i'm going to ask you to be quiet and i'm going to answer questions from the press
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:09.960]  at this point back to the corporate narrative
[2:02:09.960 --> 2:02:12.840]  questions all right so there you go the rest is from ivory
[2:02:12.840 --> 2:02:16.440]  hecker there independent journalist but i mean rob
[2:02:16.440 --> 2:02:20.440]  i haven't been covering this because it just it seems like it's a forced thing
[2:02:20.440 --> 2:02:24.120]  i don't know anyone from the group no traces of origin no traces of leadership
[2:02:24.120 --> 2:02:27.000]  nobody's ever reached out to me the whole thing seems weird the lincoln
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:30.200]  the lincoln project involvement they magically show up at these events
[2:02:30.200 --> 2:02:33.400]  they're riding around in u halls they all have uniforms covering their faces
[2:02:33.400 --> 2:02:37.160]  all very sketchy and then this kind of look like the same build too
[2:02:37.160 --> 2:02:40.680]  there's not a fat guy in the bunch and then this though rob so what do you make
[2:02:40.680 --> 2:02:43.800]  of that the police chief oh we don't have informants after the police officer on
[2:02:43.800 --> 2:02:47.160]  the scene says we have informants well you could tell by that big smile and
[2:02:47.160 --> 2:02:50.280]  that look to the left he does well he's like oh
[2:02:50.280 --> 2:02:54.200]  oh crap what just happened somebody just who he's probably thinking what officer
[2:02:54.200 --> 2:02:57.400]  said that there's one there's that one patriot officer on there
[2:02:57.400 --> 2:03:00.600]  that brought it up and we got to find out who he is and rude him out of the
[2:03:00.600 --> 2:03:03.400]  department because that's the other thing we got a federalized the police
[2:03:03.400 --> 2:03:05.720]  they got it they want the police to take federal control
[2:03:05.720 --> 2:03:09.160]  and this is another way of doing that is by getting them to work with the feds
[2:03:09.160 --> 2:03:12.920]  in different operations either embedded in this thing or maybe there are feds
[2:03:12.920 --> 2:03:16.840]  in there he said there's no fbi but he did say i think you're mistaken he
[2:03:16.840 --> 2:03:19.320]  didn't say you're wrong that we had informants in there he said i think
[2:03:19.320 --> 2:03:21.880]  you're mistaken i think we can all say in complete
[2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:25.240]  confidence that there is at least one informant in that group now here's
[2:03:25.240 --> 2:03:29.720]  here's another aspect of this so that we can keep ourselves grounded here
[2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:33.080]  another problem we have in this country is yes men
[2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:37.240]  yes men so you might have a police chief that might not even be politically
[2:03:37.240 --> 2:03:41.880]  motivated but he gets he gets calls from up higher federal government or
[2:03:41.880 --> 2:03:44.760]  something police association calls from on the high saying hey
[2:03:44.760 --> 2:03:48.600]  we're gonna put embeds into this group and they're gonna be communicating with
[2:03:48.600 --> 2:03:51.400]  you don't tell anyone that that's what's going on
[2:03:51.400 --> 2:03:54.600]  so this so then oh he just does it because he's a yes man
[2:03:54.600 --> 2:03:59.080]  so then what happens well who's really running a show who's organizing this
[2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:01.960]  who's renting the u-hauls who's giving them their uniforms
[2:04:01.960 --> 2:04:06.040]  is that the informant is that the feds or is someone else sourcing
[2:04:06.040 --> 2:04:09.640]  the monies for these purchases and rentals
[2:04:09.640 --> 2:04:12.520]  these are the questions that need to be asked but rob you made a point of how
[2:04:12.520 --> 2:04:15.640]  come they don't ever show their faces including after the arrest how come
[2:04:15.640 --> 2:04:18.440]  nobody's showing their face well because they have to keep these people
[2:04:18.440 --> 2:04:21.240]  hidden and and it's like this i go back to this little
[2:04:21.240 --> 2:04:25.320]  tweet from representative stewby he's he's showing a picture of a hit the
[2:04:25.320 --> 2:04:28.600]  streets you said you'd riot a dc call to action says call to
[2:04:28.600 --> 2:04:30.840]  action right there there's no nothing implied
[2:04:30.840 --> 2:04:34.200]  call to action you said you'd riot we're gonna hit the streets if we don't
[2:04:34.200 --> 2:04:37.800]  like the the roe versus way decision but
[2:04:37.800 --> 2:04:41.080]  you know anybody who goes up and shows up at a drag queen story art says
[2:04:41.080 --> 2:04:44.360]  anything is going to be investigated for a hate crime actively or an american
[2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:48.120]  flag or if you're american like there's a group called shut down dc running around
[2:04:48.120 --> 2:04:51.880]  dc right now raging with lawyers and bondsmen's in case they get arrested
[2:04:51.880 --> 2:04:54.120]  because they're planning on committing crimes but they're allowed to commit
[2:04:54.120 --> 2:04:57.160]  crimes nobody else's
[2:04:57.960 --> 2:05:02.200]  the internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan
[2:05:02.200 --> 2:05:05.560]  alec shones was right people ask what's it like to be vindicated
[2:05:05.560 --> 2:05:09.400]  well it's actually very sick feeling because i knew this was coming
[2:05:09.400 --> 2:05:13.400]  i tried to stop it and now everything i've talked about
[2:05:13.400 --> 2:05:17.320]  is going to become more important than ever because the globalists aren't
[2:05:17.320 --> 2:05:21.160]  hiding anymore in policy reports and documents
[2:05:21.160 --> 2:05:24.440]  it's now out in the open claus Schwab said last week
[2:05:24.440 --> 2:05:29.400]  that they rule the earth the bilderberg group founded devos group
[2:05:29.400 --> 2:05:33.560]  so now the fight's out in the open they're making their move
[2:05:33.560 --> 2:05:36.520]  because they know they're behind schedule we're going to win this thing
[2:05:36.520 --> 2:05:39.880]  god's watching the children counting on us i just want to thank the viewers
[2:05:39.880 --> 2:05:43.240]  and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support
[2:05:43.240 --> 2:05:45.880]  because without you info wars would not be here
[2:05:45.880 --> 2:05:49.640]  so i want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war
[2:05:49.640 --> 2:05:53.480]  and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance so i want to thank you
[2:05:53.480 --> 2:05:57.240]  and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your
[2:05:57.240 --> 2:05:59.960]  efforts
[2:06:06.360 --> 2:06:10.200]  live from the info wars dot com studios
[2:06:10.200 --> 2:06:14.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show and now
[2:06:14.120 --> 2:06:17.880]  your host owin shroyer
[2:06:17.880 --> 2:06:22.680]  i got something that tells me what it's all about
[2:06:22.680 --> 2:06:29.160]  i got some and i'm super bad what's going on with james brown and drag
[2:06:29.160 --> 2:06:33.400]  aka maxine waters what's she got i'm super bad
[2:06:33.400 --> 2:06:37.480]  folks there was a clip of her standing behind
[2:06:37.480 --> 2:06:42.440]  nancy polosi who's delivering a speech i think it was yesterday or this weekend
[2:06:42.440 --> 2:06:45.640]  maxine waters doesn't blink for like 30 seconds
[2:06:45.640 --> 2:06:49.880]  what is that what is going on with that freak
[2:06:49.880 --> 2:06:53.960]  what demon has possessed maxine waters
[2:06:54.760 --> 2:07:01.000]  or or perhaps maxine waters is just so focused james brown and drag
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:06.760]  maxine waters is just so focused because she just took a packet of turbo force
[2:07:06.760 --> 2:07:13.400]  from info wars store dot com it is known to give you 10 hours of
[2:07:13.400 --> 2:07:17.000]  energy folks she may have done she may have done a packet of
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:21.960]  turbo force from info wars store dot com and then she may have also
[2:07:21.960 --> 2:07:25.800]  done a couple droppers of the brain force ultra
[2:07:25.800 --> 2:07:29.960]  and so she just had stupendous focus there she didn't even blink for hours
[2:07:29.960 --> 2:07:34.600]  maxine waters unbelievable stuff there uh what a freak
[2:07:34.600 --> 2:07:37.800]  what an absolute psycho what a what a criminal maniac

[2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:37.640]  so so i just got to say this the alexa pure
[2:09:37.640 --> 2:09:41.160]  air filtration system guys hit me with a dot camera real quick
[2:09:41.160 --> 2:09:45.320]  i want you guys to look this is in my house now keep in mind i don't have any
[2:09:45.320 --> 2:09:51.320]  pets and i live alone okay and this is from
[2:09:51.320 --> 2:09:54.920]  what's a better angle is probably this this is from eight months
[2:09:54.920 --> 2:09:58.760]  of usage in my in my alexa pure breeze system by the way i have three of these
[2:09:58.760 --> 2:10:02.920]  in my house so i have three of these i live alone
[2:10:02.920 --> 2:10:06.760]  and i don't have any pets and look at that after
[2:10:06.760 --> 2:10:10.200]  three months i don't smoke no smokers inside either
[2:10:10.200 --> 2:10:14.520]  so so that's from eight months right there and i don't even know if you can
[2:10:14.520 --> 2:10:19.400]  really see how black the used one is on the right compared to the clean one on
[2:10:19.400 --> 2:10:22.920]  the left so folks let me tell you the studies are
[2:10:22.920 --> 2:10:27.000]  out your home has polluted air in it
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:31.400]  sucks but that's the case that's why we sell air filtration systems at infowars

[2:10:44.600 --> 2:10:49.800]  all the impurities removed from my air in eight months
[2:10:49.800 --> 2:10:53.000]  so it's usually about six to eight months on those filters i did i extended
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:54.920]  mine out to eight and you saw what it looked like

[2:11:06.200 --> 2:11:09.480]  filtration system filtered that out of the air in my house
[2:11:09.480 --> 2:11:12.600]  cannot recommend that enough ladies and gentlemen so

[2:11:26.440 --> 2:11:32.120]  let's do this quickly um chris coons was on with brett bear
[2:11:32.120 --> 2:11:36.680]  and this guy's just incredible uh chris coons supposedly a moderate democrat
[2:11:36.680 --> 2:11:44.280]  give me a break um here's chris coons when asked about how come
[2:11:44.280 --> 2:11:48.200]  liberals get to protest and riot and and do whatever the hell they want engage
[2:11:48.200 --> 2:11:52.040]  in violence but but january six is the big crime uh here's
[2:11:52.040 --> 2:11:56.600]  senator coons responding to that in clip 14
[2:11:56.600 --> 2:11:59.320]  senator we're getting ready for this this ruling and it's going to be
[2:11:59.320 --> 2:12:02.520]  controversial no matter what happens if it matches the draft
[2:12:02.520 --> 2:12:07.800]  the leaked draft opinion or not there is this this law on the books i'm just
[2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:11.720]  asking should they follow the law should the attorney general say
[2:12:11.720 --> 2:12:16.040]  yes arrest those people before something happens
[2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:20.920]  well brett i think uh if the leaked version of the opinion is matched by
[2:12:20.920 --> 2:12:25.400]  what would be a remarkable act of uh judicial activism conservative judicial
[2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:28.360]  activism there will be understandable anger
[2:12:28.360 --> 2:12:32.520]  across the nation as an elected official i've certainly had protests
[2:12:32.520 --> 2:12:36.600]  out front of my house really many of us have who serve in congress or another
[2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:39.800]  elective office is but we need to make sure
[2:12:39.800 --> 2:12:42.440]  that all appropriate actions are being taken
[2:12:42.440 --> 2:12:46.440]  to ensure the safety of members of our federal judiciary including supreme
[2:12:46.440 --> 2:12:51.000]  court justice and by the way they lie like aoc said
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:54.200]  all all the republicans voted down the security
[2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:57.640]  no democrats did too actually i think 27 of them
[2:12:57.640 --> 2:13:02.120]  uh including herself but that they say all only republicans didn't vote for
[2:13:02.120 --> 2:13:06.520]  the security no democrats but chris coons says
[2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:10.440]  that he's had protests outside of his house really you ever heard about that
[2:13:10.440 --> 2:13:13.560]  i wonder if that's true i think he lied i'd like to see some proof
[2:13:13.560 --> 2:13:17.160]  wouldn't be surprised if he lied he's a democrat after all and they say oh
[2:13:17.160 --> 2:13:21.560]  conservative activism from the bench folks there all democrats are activists
[2:13:21.560 --> 2:13:24.600]  what does that mean conservative activism from the bench
[2:13:24.600 --> 2:13:28.920]  because you don't get your way because you you can't kill babies which in your
[2:13:28.920 --> 2:13:32.120]  state chris coons probably you still will be able to
[2:13:32.120 --> 2:13:37.640]  i mean just what an unmitigated liar conservative activists on the bench
[2:13:37.640 --> 2:13:40.760]  every every leftist democrat liberal is an activist
[2:13:40.760 --> 2:13:45.320]  and puts their agenda over reality and common sense
[2:13:45.320 --> 2:13:49.080]  and the constitution bill of rights every day conservative activist judges
[2:13:49.080 --> 2:13:53.080]  giving the decision back to the states saying we really ridding their hands of
[2:13:53.080 --> 2:13:55.800]  the situation saying we're not going to be involved in abortion anymore you
[2:13:55.800 --> 2:13:59.000]  states can take care of that that's conservative activism
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:04.200]  but chris coons doesn't stop there he directly is asked about what about
[2:14:04.200 --> 2:14:07.560]  chuck schumer's statement did that lead to some of this violence here was chris
[2:14:07.560 --> 2:14:11.160]  coons response in clip 15 the lot has been made
[2:14:11.160 --> 2:14:16.280]  this week about words how much they matter how much stirring the pot giving
[2:14:16.280 --> 2:14:19.560]  the green light to violence in any way shape or form
[2:14:19.560 --> 2:14:23.080]  is unacceptable take a listen to this
[2:14:23.080 --> 2:14:27.800]  i want to tell you more such i want to tell you
[2:14:27.800 --> 2:14:31.560]  cavenore you have released the whirlwind
[2:14:31.560 --> 2:14:38.840]  and you will pay the price you won't know what hit you if you go forward with
[2:14:38.840 --> 2:14:42.840]  these awful decisions on the steps of the supreme court did those words
[2:14:42.840 --> 2:14:49.160]  qualify senator so here's a key distinction what
[2:14:49.160 --> 2:14:54.120]  senator schumer was saying was that he was upset he was alarmed he was
[2:14:54.120 --> 2:14:58.040]  concerned at the prospect that justices would reverse
[2:14:58.040 --> 2:15:01.880]  decades of a well-established fundamental constitutional right in our
[2:15:01.880 --> 2:15:05.320]  country no i don't say was no constitutional right
[2:15:05.320 --> 2:15:09.320]  attack them there is no constitutional right so that's a
[2:15:09.320 --> 2:15:12.760]  lie but chris coons says oh there's a key distinction
[2:15:12.760 --> 2:15:16.360]  yeah we know the key distinction schumer's a democrat schumer's a liberal
[2:15:16.360 --> 2:15:21.560]  so he's above the law we get it that's the key distinction
[2:15:21.560 --> 2:15:24.600]  if it was a republican that said something like that
[2:15:24.600 --> 2:15:27.800]  and then activists went in in front of liberal justices houses
[2:15:27.800 --> 2:15:30.680]  you know damn well they'd blame that republican just like they try to blame
[2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:33.800]  trump for everything but oh there's a key distinction says
[2:15:33.800 --> 2:15:38.680]  chris coons we know democrat liberal privilege you guys are above the law
[2:15:38.680 --> 2:15:43.400]  you guys get to riot and murder and cheat and steal and lie
[2:15:43.400 --> 2:15:47.560]  you get to do that no one else does no one else wants to but you anyway
[2:15:47.560 --> 2:15:50.840]  and right now in dc they've got multiple groups violent groups
[2:15:50.840 --> 2:15:53.960]  ready to riot and rage if they can't kill their kid
[2:15:53.960 --> 2:15:56.440]  their babies
[2:15:56.840 --> 2:16:01.240]  that justices new film 2000 mules is the most important documentary in modern
[2:16:01.240 --> 2:16:04.200]  times because it proves how the deep state
[2:16:04.200 --> 2:16:07.400]  stole a 2020 election and how they're planning to steal future elections
[2:16:07.400 --> 2:16:11.320]  and complete our journey to basically being like venezuela now it's great that

[2:17:08.440 --> 2:17:13.080]  because we innately by god have been given the keys for our own minds our
[2:17:13.080 --> 2:17:16.200]  own psychies our own souls and by connecting to god
[2:17:16.200 --> 2:17:20.360]  we can empower ourselves and transcend the quote
[2:17:20.360 --> 2:17:24.600]  fallen or sinful state so the chemicals that we ingest and
[2:17:24.600 --> 2:17:29.480]  all the things we try to bring into our bodies to change who we are
[2:17:29.480 --> 2:17:32.120]  are only lowering us they're only making us more depressed
[2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:35.800]  in the end they're only making us less fulfilled it is only by going
[2:17:35.800 --> 2:17:38.680]  within and really making that connection to god that we can
[2:17:38.680 --> 2:17:42.040]  truly empower ourselves that's why the globalist bombardist
[2:17:42.040 --> 2:17:46.200]  toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals
[2:17:46.200 --> 2:17:50.280]  and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to

[2:20:17.880 --> 2:20:23.560]  going on here and it's a big one this is uh part one
[2:20:23.560 --> 2:20:30.280]  from the conservative woman paula jardin vaccine was on the way before
[2:20:30.280 --> 2:20:34.360]  covid was confirmed vaccine was on the way before
[2:20:34.360 --> 2:20:38.760]  covid was confirmed in fact guys i don't know what's going on i sent a
[2:20:38.760 --> 2:20:42.440]  bunch of stuff on twitter to be printed i never got it but
[2:20:42.440 --> 2:20:47.240]  part of the thing in this story is when they first
[2:20:47.240 --> 2:20:52.440]  signed the contracts to produce the covid vaccines
[2:20:52.440 --> 2:20:56.360]  only 18 people had been diagnosed with covid 18
[2:20:56.360 --> 2:21:02.200]  and they were all in china and somehow and that was in january
[2:21:02.200 --> 2:21:06.360]  and somehow with that they were able to sign billion dollar
[2:21:06.360 --> 2:21:11.080]  vaccine deals uh for billions of vaccines
[2:21:11.080 --> 2:21:14.920]  just incredible stuff and this is just part one of paula
[2:21:14.920 --> 2:21:19.160]  jardin's breakdown here more is coming it just shows how the whole thing was
[2:21:19.160 --> 2:21:23.240]  planned the whole thing was scripted we were lied to we were used we were
[2:21:23.240 --> 2:21:27.000]  abused and it's a it's a massive criminal
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:30.520]  enterprise this covid 19 vaccine and covid itself
[2:21:30.520 --> 2:21:34.200]  that sadly won't be addressed i'm afraid
[2:21:34.200 --> 2:21:38.520]  and of course we blew this story out of the water on monday with mike adams in
[2:21:38.520 --> 2:21:42.040]  studio global medical bombshell scientists prove
[2:21:42.040 --> 2:21:45.640]  scientists prove covid vaccine causes blood clots live on air
[2:21:45.640 --> 2:21:49.640]  watch dr shocked by epidemic of mysterious clots found in suddenly
[2:21:49.640 --> 2:21:53.000]  deceased vaccinated adults nothing like this has ever been pulled out of the
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:56.120]  human body and it's only happening in vaccinated
[2:21:56.120 --> 2:21:59.880]  individuals and so i'm not saying this to scare
[2:21:59.880 --> 2:22:04.280]  anybody i'm not saying this to you know tell you to panic
[2:22:04.280 --> 2:22:07.640]  that's what's going on now if you've taken a vaccine and and
[2:22:07.640 --> 2:22:11.560]  you obviously have some emotions and a response to this
[2:22:11.560 --> 2:22:15.160]  uh you know maybe there's some help for you out there
[2:22:15.160 --> 2:22:18.840]  but that's what's going on and now they want to give these kids
[2:22:18.840 --> 2:22:23.880]  vaccines too um but yeah mortician finds massive hand-sized
[2:22:23.880 --> 2:22:27.560]  clots in cadavers after factually so just it's never been seen before it's all
[2:22:27.560 --> 2:22:31.640]  the vaccinated people and then um you know you'll never know
[2:22:31.640 --> 2:22:35.480]  with this stuff sadly because you're not allowed to know
[2:22:35.480 --> 2:22:40.680]  us representative shawn castin's 17-year-old daughter dies unexpectedly
[2:22:40.680 --> 2:22:44.200]  it's another sudden adult death syndrome and of course they're saying uh
[2:22:44.200 --> 2:22:47.480]  you know respect the family's privacy we're not answering any questions or
[2:22:47.480 --> 2:22:51.240]  any details about the death but um healthy young girl
[2:22:51.240 --> 2:22:55.480]  17 years old can we ask if she was vaccinated is that allowed
[2:22:55.480 --> 2:22:59.320]  there was this um a big fitness guru named i believe his name was matthew
[2:22:59.320 --> 2:23:03.240]  murray mcdonald i think was his name matthew murray mcdonald 27 years old
[2:23:03.240 --> 2:23:08.120]  great health heart failure not allowed to ask if it's the vaccine
[2:23:08.120 --> 2:23:12.040]  the beavers justin beaver and his wife hailey
[2:23:12.040 --> 2:23:16.600]  both hailey has severe blood clots and now justin beaver
[2:23:16.600 --> 2:23:20.920]  can't perform anymore because he has bell's palsy
[2:23:20.920 --> 2:23:25.080]  or a different variation of bell's palsy i forget the name of it
[2:23:25.080 --> 2:23:28.840]  so he can't perform anymore because he has a facial paralysis
[2:23:28.840 --> 2:23:33.400]  both of them have been vaccinated now the rumor is and of course
[2:23:33.400 --> 2:23:38.040]  there's no way of confirming this the rumor is
[2:23:38.040 --> 2:23:42.200]  both of them suspect it was from the vaccine beaver especially
[2:23:42.200 --> 2:23:48.840]  but he was told by his uh basically his handlers at the label company the
[2:23:48.840 --> 2:23:52.600]  record label company that if he says anything about the vaccine or side
[2:23:52.600 --> 2:23:55.800]  effects or it causing his facial paralysis they'll drop him from the
[2:23:55.800 --> 2:23:59.000]  label now those are rumors who knows if that's true
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:02.520]  but it's odd how he just says oh my face is paralyzed
[2:24:02.520 --> 2:24:06.360]  i might not be able to perform again he's been vaccinated the canadian justin
[2:24:06.360 --> 2:24:09.960]  beaver and now they want to give it to kids
[2:24:09.960 --> 2:24:15.320]  fda advisors unanimously recommend moderna COVID-19 vaccine for ages six to
[2:24:15.320 --> 2:24:18.120]  17 despite data showing high risks of heart
[2:24:18.120 --> 2:24:20.920]  inflammation and why would you even get the vaccine
[2:24:20.920 --> 2:24:24.440]  what what does the vaccine even do to you it doesn't protect you from COVID it
[2:24:24.440 --> 2:24:27.080]  doesn't protect you from getting COVID or spreading COVID that you don't have
[2:24:27.080 --> 2:24:29.800]  any more or less rights after you get the vaccine
[2:24:29.800 --> 2:24:34.200]  all you have is the side effects that's it there is not a single positive
[2:24:34.200 --> 2:24:38.280]  that comes from the COVID vaccine nothing
[2:24:39.560 --> 2:24:45.560]  what are they doing on this story from Reuters
[2:24:45.560 --> 2:24:48.920]  the headline has been changed so much i can't even get my head around it
[2:24:48.920 --> 2:24:53.480]  the first headline moderna COVID vaccine may pose higher heart
[2:24:53.480 --> 2:24:58.680]  inflammation risk in the united states and then the second headline
[2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:05.880]  USA fda fda advisors weigh moderna vaccine heart risk for young men
[2:25:05.880 --> 2:25:09.800]  and then the the final edit of the headline is
[2:25:09.800 --> 2:25:16.360]  us fda advisors overwhelmingly back moderna COVID vaccine for ages 16 to 17
[2:25:16.360 --> 2:25:20.760]  so first headline was pose high heart inflammation risk
[2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:24.040]  second headline was could be heart inflammation risk
[2:25:24.040 --> 2:25:27.640]  the headline they finally landed on is
[2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:32.120]  highly recommended by fda and we went back in the way back machine and found
[2:25:32.120 --> 2:25:35.880]  all the different variations same had same story from Reuters same story
[2:25:35.880 --> 2:25:39.880]  three different headlines but the story is about how it's a risk to take the
[2:25:39.880 --> 2:25:42.680]  vaccine and it causes heart inflammation but they didn't want that in the
[2:25:42.680 --> 2:25:46.440]  headline because that's all most people see so
[2:25:46.440 --> 2:25:49.720]  oh the headline saying the vaccine is risky get rid of that
[2:25:49.720 --> 2:25:54.520]  say how great it is tell us how great the government says it is
[2:25:54.520 --> 2:25:58.440]  this is all about money you will burn in hell for eternity speakers lambasted
[2:25:58.440 --> 2:26:02.680]  fda advisors during advisory committee hearing
[2:26:02.680 --> 2:26:07.800]  the video is there at the gateway pundit yeah people are waking up quickly to
[2:26:07.800 --> 2:26:11.240]  what is really going on in this planet people are waking up quickly to the
[2:26:11.240 --> 2:26:15.080]  war that's been waged against them since the day they were born
[2:26:15.080 --> 2:26:18.280]  by our corporate world government establishment looking to cement itself
[2:26:18.280 --> 2:26:22.680]  right now taking its mask off showing you what it really is who
[2:26:22.680 --> 2:26:27.160]  it really is canada makes three jabs the new fully vaccinated standard
[2:26:27.160 --> 2:26:30.840]  saying two doses doesn't work anymore oh is that because trodo got sick
[2:26:30.840 --> 2:26:34.760]  jabbed and boosted trodo sick again with covid
[2:26:34.760 --> 2:26:40.280]  says oh thank god i was jabbed of course it worked so well for you
[2:26:40.280 --> 2:26:43.560]  uk health agency now monkeypox is the big thing
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:47.800]  uk health agency 99 percent of monkeypox cases are gay men
[2:26:47.800 --> 2:26:51.560]  oh so covid is so bad 99.9 percent survivability
[2:26:51.560 --> 2:26:55.880]  i think monkeypox is like a 91 or something percent survivability
[2:26:55.880 --> 2:27:00.120]  but oh covid 99 and they say you have to wear a mask you have to take a vaccine
[2:27:00.120 --> 2:27:02.840]  don't leave your house go through all these measures the plexiglass where
[2:27:02.840 --> 2:27:06.360]  it loves all of it but then monkeypox okay we pretty much know how you're
[2:27:06.360 --> 2:27:09.560]  getting it gay sex we pretty much know how you're
[2:27:09.560 --> 2:27:13.960]  getting it sodomite uh sodomy but are they telling people not to
[2:27:13.960 --> 2:27:16.760]  have sex are they telling people not to have anal sex are they telling
[2:27:16.760 --> 2:27:21.400]  gay people not to sodomize one another no because that would be bigoted
[2:27:21.400 --> 2:27:25.960]  so you see it's not logic if it can't be applied universally
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:29.880]  it's propaganda so it was never logic with covid anyway
[2:27:29.880 --> 2:27:34.040]  but that same logic can't be applied to monkeypox because it's all propaganda
[2:27:34.040 --> 2:27:37.400]  the world health organization goes woke with an effort to rename monkeypox
[2:27:37.400 --> 2:27:41.400]  virus to avoid being racist and discriminatory yeah all the gay men are
[2:27:41.400 --> 2:27:44.840]  getting it hey go have gay sex and don't even worry we won't call it monkeypox
[2:27:44.840 --> 2:27:49.640]  anymore because that's racist oh yes the virus is racist
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:53.240]  did white people not evolve from monkeys or are we abandoning that
[2:27:53.240 --> 2:27:56.600]  lie already china flips out of a world health organization
[2:27:56.600 --> 2:28:00.600]  saying lab leak theory needs further study uh-oh
[2:28:00.600 --> 2:28:05.080]  they don't like that new study finds many children unable to say their own name
[2:28:05.080 --> 2:28:08.840]  due to impact of lockdown yeah as if the high school graduation rates weren't
[2:28:08.840 --> 2:28:12.440]  low enough as if the literacy rates weren't low enough as if the gpas
[2:28:12.440 --> 2:28:15.720]  weren't low enough now they're going to be even lower
[2:28:15.720 --> 2:28:19.960]  thanks to the response to covet the lockdowns
[2:28:19.960 --> 2:28:23.320]  huh and then uh tell me do you think fouchie knows anything about this this
[2:28:23.320 --> 2:28:26.440]  is right up his alley distressing undercover footage
[2:28:26.440 --> 2:28:31.560]  shows beagle puppies whimpering in pain and monkeys in neck restraints as they
[2:28:31.560 --> 2:28:36.280]  are force-fed at us testing lab uh fouchie is real famous for
[2:28:36.280 --> 2:28:40.680]  torturing and killing animals actually i wonder if he knows anything about this
[2:28:40.680 --> 2:28:43.400]  yes fouchie the guy that tortures and kills animals
[2:28:43.400 --> 2:28:47.720]  that tells you how much he loves you you know most psychotic serial killers
[2:28:47.720 --> 2:28:51.640]  start by killing animals right but i'm sure that has nothing to do with
[2:28:51.640 --> 2:28:58.280]  anthony fouchie right there's an old better one saying

[2:33:58.280 --> 2:34:03.080]  81 million votes dnc forced to move kamala harris fundraiser to fall because
[2:34:03.080 --> 2:34:07.000]  they couldn't sell enough tickets wow
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:10.200]  you know the kamala her story is a real interesting one
[2:34:10.200 --> 2:34:14.120]  here's a woman who slept her way to the top
[2:34:14.120 --> 2:34:19.080]  and here's a woman who is the first female and i suppose uh...
[2:34:19.080 --> 2:34:25.000]  black african-american she's not african-american but she pretends to be
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  she's a jamaican and her family actually ran a slave camp
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:32.040]  but uh... they don't want you to know about that
[2:34:32.040 --> 2:34:36.680]  regardless it's an interesting story here's kamala harris
[2:34:36.680 --> 2:34:42.200]  the first black female vice president and she's a nothing she's a zero
[2:34:42.200 --> 2:34:45.720]  and and you've always known that i've always known that what's interesting
[2:34:45.720 --> 2:34:48.760]  is notice that she's not celebrated anymore
[2:34:48.760 --> 2:34:54.120]  the media doesn't fawn over kamala harris she's been a disappearing act
[2:34:54.120 --> 2:34:58.600]  how is that how is kamala harris she's so great she's unbelievable
[2:34:58.600 --> 2:35:02.440]  she's a disappearing act she's a nothing she's a nobody she's a zilch a zero
[2:35:02.440 --> 2:35:05.960]  anata the first female vice president the first
[2:35:05.960 --> 2:35:08.280]  african-american female vice president i mean
[2:35:08.280 --> 2:35:11.640]  oh my gosh there should be constant fanfare
[2:35:11.640 --> 2:35:17.080]  constant promotion they've abandoned her
[2:35:17.080 --> 2:35:21.800]  why because she is a joke she is an embarrassment
[2:35:21.800 --> 2:35:25.880]  but aside from that folks because they put jerry nadler on the tv
[2:35:25.880 --> 2:35:28.600]  so they don't really care about a joke and an embarrassment if you're a loyal
[2:35:28.600 --> 2:35:33.640]  democrat you know why they don't promote kamala like you think they would
[2:35:33.640 --> 2:35:38.360]  because nobody likes her folks nobody likes her
[2:35:38.360 --> 2:35:44.440]  she is very very unlikable democrats don't like her the media
[2:35:44.440 --> 2:35:49.160]  doesn't like her nobody likes kamala harris
[2:35:49.160 --> 2:35:53.240]  isn't that amazing the amazing disappearing first-ever
[2:35:53.240 --> 2:35:59.480]  female black vice president no fanfare the obsession is as waned
[2:35:59.480 --> 2:36:03.240]  because nobody likes her and she's an embarrassment it's just an amazing
[2:36:03.240 --> 2:36:07.400]  thing isn't it oh she's so great oh first female oh first
[2:36:07.400 --> 2:36:12.520]  african-american oh well where is she the disappearing act nobody cares
[2:36:12.520 --> 2:36:16.280]  press secretary defends biden's mental health
[2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:19.960]  from don lemon that's not a question we should even be asking oh yeah he just
[2:36:19.960 --> 2:36:24.200]  fumbles his words slurs his word craps his pants forgets where he's at
[2:36:24.200 --> 2:36:28.120]  uh it takes every weekend off gets a lid called on him by
[2:36:28.120 --> 2:36:31.960]  midday don't ask that question only ask that about
[2:36:31.960 --> 2:36:35.160]  trump now i want to get back to something i briefly discussed yesterday
[2:36:35.160 --> 2:36:39.160]  with roger not to belabor the point but i couldn't really complete the
[2:36:39.160 --> 2:36:43.800]  process here so when i saw the text thread between
[2:36:43.800 --> 2:36:50.120]  hannity and mackinanny it just to me screams it just
[2:36:50.120 --> 2:36:56.760]  it's it's not an episode it's the entire series
[2:36:56.760 --> 2:37:01.080]  the new york dc elitists that want to run the show
[2:37:01.080 --> 2:37:04.920]  so when i see hannity saying no more crazy people to mackinanny
[2:37:04.920 --> 2:37:08.840]  that's hannity saying hey let me control who comes in and out of the white house
[2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:12.840]  let me control who has and doesn't have trump's ear
[2:37:12.840 --> 2:37:16.440]  we can't have these people getting in there these crazy people
[2:37:16.440 --> 2:37:20.360]  and by the way stop talking about the stolen election
[2:37:20.360 --> 2:37:25.480]  stop talking about that and let's pardon hunter biden
[2:37:25.480 --> 2:37:27.880]  what
[2:37:30.280 --> 2:37:35.000]  very odd right from sean hannity a patriot and a proud american patriot
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:40.840]  fighting for your country wanting to control trump's ear in the white house
[2:37:40.840 --> 2:37:46.520]  wanting trump to shut up about elections being stolen wanting to pardon hunter biden
[2:37:46.520 --> 2:37:49.800]  now i'm not meaning this is an attack on sean hannity quite frankly
[2:37:49.800 --> 2:37:53.160]  the words and the text can speak for themselves i'm saying it's an
[2:37:53.160 --> 2:37:58.760]  illustration of east coast elitism dc new york elitism
[2:37:58.760 --> 2:38:02.040]  thinking they run the show nobody else should be able to run the show
[2:38:02.040 --> 2:38:05.320]  and really there's an there's actually an angle of fear
[2:38:05.320 --> 2:38:08.760]  here because they understand their influence
[2:38:08.760 --> 2:38:13.960]  and their power and maybe even their wealth is illegitimate
[2:38:13.960 --> 2:38:17.160]  and so they're afraid that if it's exposed as illegitimate they'll no
[2:38:17.160 --> 2:38:20.760]  longer have that crown they'll no longer have that throne
[2:38:20.760 --> 2:38:24.120]  that they've had for so long it's part of the reason why they hated trump
[2:38:24.120 --> 2:38:28.200]  including sean hannity when he was running but see here's what they've done
[2:38:28.200 --> 2:38:32.280]  and again i don't want to be critical of jason miller who uh
[2:38:32.280 --> 2:38:36.040]  helps run gab but boy oh boy did they make him look bad
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:41.480]  during the january sixth hearing boy oh boy did they make him look bad miller
[2:38:41.480 --> 2:38:45.000]  says ruta juliani was intoxicated on election night 2020 now
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:48.600]  i've been deposed a lot so i know how this goes
[2:38:48.600 --> 2:38:53.080]  but but aside from the ins and outs and the psychology of
[2:38:53.080 --> 2:38:56.920]  deposition here's what you really need to understand
[2:38:56.920 --> 2:39:00.840]  they deposed these people for eight to ten hours
[2:39:00.840 --> 2:39:06.600]  and they milked about 30 seconds to a minute of each deposition that they
[2:39:06.600 --> 2:39:09.720]  could use for their made for tv january sixth
[2:39:09.720 --> 2:39:13.240]  hearing event so yeah they make miller look bad
[2:39:13.240 --> 2:39:15.480]  again i don't want to be critical of miller i don't want to be critical of
[2:39:15.480 --> 2:39:19.400]  hannity and all this their words their things can speak for themselves
[2:39:19.400 --> 2:39:24.440]  but you have to understand they probably grilled jason miller for 10 hours
[2:39:24.440 --> 2:39:28.440]  and then they took two minutes of his deposition to use for their made for tv
[2:39:28.440 --> 2:39:32.920]  event to make him look bad and make trump look bad that's what these lawyers do
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:37.400]  and that's honestly kind of typical in a deposition quite frankly for cases so
[2:39:37.400 --> 2:39:42.280]  uh it's not that out of the norm but that's what they did
[2:39:42.280 --> 2:39:47.080]  so oh let's grill this person for 10 hours so that we can get 30 seconds of
[2:39:47.080 --> 2:39:50.760]  content out of them and that's what the democrats and their lawyers have done
[2:39:50.760 --> 2:39:54.600]  now this is all illegitimate to begin with unlike other cases where deposition
[2:39:54.600 --> 2:39:59.400]  may go down uh but that's the process and of course uh bill bar we thought he
[2:39:59.400 --> 2:40:03.240]  was a loyal american patriot turns out he's a deep state hack as well
[2:40:03.240 --> 2:40:06.680]  dinesh desuza challenges bill bar to debate on merits of his movie because
[2:40:06.680 --> 2:40:09.880]  bill bar laughed it off and said there's nothing to see here
[2:40:09.880 --> 2:40:13.160]  uh so he he he turns out to hate us as well
[2:40:13.160 --> 2:40:16.840]  so he must like his cushy cushy little role in the deep state
[2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:21.000]  uh but dinesh desuva dinesh desuza challenges bill bar to debate
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:25.000]  the merits of his movie uh bill bar won't show up my guess is he's a coward
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:28.440]  mayor rudigiani gives statement to the gateway pundit regarding the fraudulent
[2:40:28.440 --> 2:40:32.440]  january 6 hearing what role did antifa and the fbi play
[2:40:32.440 --> 2:40:36.200]  that's the key question ladies and gentlemen
[2:40:36.200 --> 2:40:40.440]  and more and more people are starting to realize that's the quick key question
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:44.040]  and i think that's part of the reason why the democrats called off their more
[2:40:44.040 --> 2:40:47.720]  uh their the rest of their january 6 hearings not only was it doing bad in
[2:40:47.720 --> 2:40:50.520]  the ratings not only wasn't making them look bad
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:53.640]  they understand that the more people that are actually looking into january
[2:40:53.640 --> 2:40:58.200]  6 the more people are asking hey was it antifa hey was it the fbi
[2:40:58.200 --> 2:41:01.720]  and they don't want that conversation out there so they're gonna have to
[2:41:01.720 --> 2:41:05.400]  basically circle back here if you will to make a gen sake joke
[2:41:05.400 --> 2:41:08.760]  they're gonna have to circle back because they got to put this to bed folks
[2:41:08.760 --> 2:41:11.320]  they can't have people knowing about the fbi in beds
[2:41:11.320 --> 2:41:14.840]  they can't have people know about antifa showing up to on the front lines
[2:41:14.840 --> 2:41:18.840]  and then changing in trump gear it's all on tape we have reaps all there
[2:41:18.840 --> 2:41:22.360]  so they have to find a way to bury all that before they bring the next round
[2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:25.880]  of january 6 trials to the tv because too many people are asking the right
[2:41:25.880 --> 2:41:29.560]  questions uh bill bar tells congress he was not
[2:41:29.560 --> 2:41:33.560]  interested in investigating any ballot trafficking in the 2020 election
[2:41:33.560 --> 2:41:38.200]  then openly laughed about it during testimony again uh bill bar turned out
[2:41:38.200 --> 2:41:41.720]  to be a uh deep stator uh we were warned though
[2:41:41.720 --> 2:41:46.600]  ousted fox news editor hosts help fuel murderous trump world rage over
[2:41:46.600 --> 2:41:50.840]  arizona call oh yes yeah fox news and
[2:41:50.840 --> 2:41:54.200]  conservatives are the ones that are fueling murderous rage
[2:41:54.200 --> 2:41:57.560]  give me a break if that's not liberals and democrats and their friends in the
[2:41:57.560 --> 2:42:01.560]  media then it doesn't exist this is an interesting one trump
[2:42:01.560 --> 2:42:05.000]  built small donors out of 250 million based on lies
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:08.680]  now the republican party continues to fundraise in trump's name
[2:42:08.680 --> 2:42:12.440]  it's obnoxious and they're saying oh trump
[2:42:12.440 --> 2:42:17.080]  fraudulently raised emails be uh because of uh he said the election was stolen
[2:42:17.080 --> 2:42:19.880]  which the people that donated probably still believe that anyway
[2:42:19.880 --> 2:42:24.200]  so you may think it's a lie as a liberal but it but the people that donated
[2:42:24.200 --> 2:42:28.120]  didn't but that's not the point all democrats do is lie
[2:42:28.120 --> 2:42:32.200]  all democrats do is lie and fundraise off lies if democrats couldn't fundraise
[2:42:32.200 --> 2:42:37.000]  off lies they'd have no money trump endorsed gubernational candidate
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:40.760]  carry lake headlines walk away campaign pack
[2:42:40.760 --> 2:42:44.920]  inaugural event in scott stale be pull watchers be pull workers and watch
[2:42:44.920 --> 2:42:48.840]  these bastards like a hawk exactly and they will be folks because more people
[2:42:48.840 --> 2:42:51.960]  are skeptical of our elections by the way where's the walk away movement for
[2:42:51.960 --> 2:42:53.400]  the right oh yeah it doesn't exist you have the
[2:42:53.400 --> 2:42:56.040]  legs it the legs it walk away because everyone's leaving the democrat party
[2:42:56.040 --> 2:42:59.880]  they're bunch the internet and talk radio are on fire
[2:42:59.880 --> 2:43:03.240]  with the slogan alec shones was right people ask what's it like to be
[2:43:03.240 --> 2:43:05.800]  vindicated well it's actually very sick feeling
[2:43:05.800 --> 2:43:09.560]  because i knew this was coming i tried to stop it
[2:43:09.560 --> 2:43:12.920]  and now everything i've talked about is going to become
[2:43:12.920 --> 2:43:17.240]  more important than ever because the globalist aren't hiding anymore
[2:43:17.240 --> 2:43:20.760]  in policy reports and documents it's now

[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:32.760]  they're coming after you not because you're a bad person because you're a
[2:46:32.760 --> 2:46:36.920]  good person because you love god and god loves you
[2:46:36.920 --> 2:46:39.960]  and so i signed up for this i signed up for this fight
[2:46:39.960 --> 2:46:43.800]  and i'm not a victim i'm an overcomer but i can't fight this fight without you
[2:46:43.800 --> 2:46:47.160]  that's why i want you always remember that i appreciate you and i thank you
[2:46:47.160 --> 2:46:51.000]  because info wars is your fight info wars is your baby it's the thing you
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:54.440]  built we did this together so god bless you all
[2:46:54.440 --> 2:46:57.160]  let's keep fighting
[2:46:58.280 --> 2:47:02.760]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[2:47:02.760 --> 2:47:27.720]  it's alex jones
[2:47:27.720 --> 2:47:33.960]  so people are really realizing the double standard here
[2:47:33.960 --> 2:47:37.720]  especially after watching democrats complain
[2:47:37.720 --> 2:47:42.280]  about protests as their democrat activists burn cities to the ground and
[2:47:42.280 --> 2:47:45.480]  loot and plunder and pillage and and murder
[2:47:45.480 --> 2:47:49.560]  at will while being protected by democrat
[2:47:49.560 --> 2:47:53.640]  soros district attorneys so everybody's watching this they can't really cover it
[2:47:53.640 --> 2:47:58.440]  up and so liberals are in dc they're at it again
[2:47:58.440 --> 2:48:01.800]  today they're pissed because they think they might not be able to abort their
[2:48:01.800 --> 2:48:05.320]  babies or i don't know what else and so uh it's the liberal
[2:48:05.320 --> 2:48:08.680]  summer of rage ladies and gentlemen
[2:48:08.680 --> 2:48:16.520]  summer of rage the liberal summer of rage continues
[2:48:16.520 --> 2:48:20.280]  cabinon's neighbor claims pro-abortion protesters are threatening
[2:48:20.280 --> 2:48:25.880]  homeowners f u and f your children wow really loving people
[2:48:25.880 --> 2:48:29.560]  these uh liberal protesters and uh they've also doxxed
[2:48:29.560 --> 2:48:33.960]  amy coney barrett's children schools uh because you know torturing
[2:48:33.960 --> 2:48:37.240]  and threatening to kill supreme court justices isn't enough for these liberal
[2:48:37.240 --> 2:48:40.200]  psychos they also want to target their children
[2:48:40.200 --> 2:48:46.840]  ah the liberal summer of rage continues and you've got two groups in dc
[2:48:46.840 --> 2:48:50.760]  that are raging right now you've got jane's revenge
[2:48:50.760 --> 2:48:54.760]  which by the way jane's revenge has taken responsibility for at least
[2:48:54.760 --> 2:48:59.320]  four pregnancy centers being fire bombed i think the total number is now
[2:48:59.320 --> 2:49:03.960]  up to 10 uh i think 10 since the leak 10
[2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:07.880]  pregnancy centers have been fire bombed by raging liberals
[2:49:07.880 --> 2:49:12.280]  it's the liberal summer of rage after all and so they're raging
[2:49:12.280 --> 2:49:15.400]  and they're burning pregnancy centers to the ground that's jane's revenge
[2:49:15.400 --> 2:49:21.000]  and they've got this call to action dc call to action night of rage folks i
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:25.080]  think you have to understand i cut that special stinger that you see liberal
[2:49:25.080 --> 2:49:28.520]  summer of rage like a month ago it and i've already been
[2:49:28.520 --> 2:49:31.240]  saying liberal summer of rage anticipating it and then i said look
[2:49:31.240 --> 2:49:33.880]  this is coming this is going to be a big story let's even have a
[2:49:33.880 --> 2:49:37.240]  stinger so that we cover it we can have a little intro it's the liberal summer
[2:49:37.240 --> 2:49:40.840]  of rage i knew this was coming it was so predictable this
[2:49:40.840 --> 2:49:44.440]  was coming i literally was cutting specials months in advance in
[2:49:44.440 --> 2:49:47.480]  anticipation oh but the fbi and the department of homeland
[2:49:47.480 --> 2:49:50.280]  security they can't figure out who the real domestic terrorists are yet no
[2:49:50.280 --> 2:49:52.520]  they know exactly who the domestic terrorists are
[2:49:52.520 --> 2:49:57.240]  it's them liberals democrats so you've got jane's addiction telling people to
[2:49:57.240 --> 2:49:59.560]  riot excuse me not jane's addiction to ban
[2:49:59.560 --> 2:50:06.280]  jane's revenge telling people to riot with flyers they're posting around dc
[2:50:06.280 --> 2:50:11.000]  and then you have the second group called shut down dc
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:14.760]  that's running around committing crimes criminal acts threatening violence
[2:50:14.760 --> 2:50:19.320]  that has lawyers embedded in there in their little groups
[2:50:19.320 --> 2:50:22.920]  and bail bondsmen's embedded in their little groups
[2:50:22.920 --> 2:50:26.440]  because they're planning on committing crimes and getting arrested
[2:50:26.440 --> 2:50:29.240]  so then most of time the police either don't bother arresting them because
[2:50:29.240 --> 2:50:31.880]  what's the point it's a waste of energy it's a waste of their time
[2:50:31.880 --> 2:50:34.440]  they know they're just going to be released anyway
[2:50:34.440 --> 2:50:39.240]  i've been behind the scenes i've been told how it goes down folks
[2:50:39.240 --> 2:50:42.760]  liberals and democrats that get arrested protesting the farthest they make it
[2:50:42.760 --> 2:50:45.720]  is booking that's the farthest they make it
[2:50:45.720 --> 2:50:49.000]  and usually by them a call comes down to their
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:53.080]  precinct that says release these individuals okay i've been there
[2:50:53.080 --> 2:50:57.160]  i've been behind the scenes i've been arrested i've had the inside scoop i've
[2:50:57.160 --> 2:51:00.280]  had the whistleblowers telling me this now they don't want to go public
[2:51:00.280 --> 2:51:04.120]  for obvious reasons they don't want to lose their job
[2:51:04.120 --> 2:51:09.160]  so i'm just telling you this exclusively because i was told this
[2:51:09.160 --> 2:51:11.880]  the multiple times i was arrested the police that arrest me the police that
[2:51:11.880 --> 2:51:15.240]  are there behind the scenes i've already said too much so
[2:51:15.240 --> 2:51:19.560]  liberals know they can riot and rage and commit crimes and nothing happens to
[2:51:19.560 --> 2:51:21.880]  them you're a trump supporter you're a conservative
[2:51:21.880 --> 2:51:25.480]  you're a christian you step on a blade of grass sideways in dc they're coming
[2:51:25.480 --> 2:51:29.000]  after you with the full force the law and uh they will be arresting people for
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:33.240]  january 6th until the year 2050 if these democrats are not removed
[2:51:33.240 --> 2:51:37.000]  from our political system as the domestic terrorist groups that they are
[2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:41.240]  but so the point is people are just watching what the left is up to
[2:51:41.240 --> 2:51:45.560]  watching them begin another summer of rage and rioting
[2:51:45.560 --> 2:51:48.440]  but then they're told oh white people are the problem
[2:51:48.440 --> 2:51:51.400]  oh conservatives are the problem oh trump supporters are the problem
[2:51:51.400 --> 2:51:54.680]  and everybody who's living in reality knows of course that's
[2:51:54.680 --> 2:51:58.520]  not the truth but it's even worse juxtaposed with the liberals getting
[2:51:58.520 --> 2:52:02.200]  ready to riot and rage again just like they did in 2020 so here's
[2:52:02.200 --> 2:52:05.880]  some of the clips guys uh let's go to this clip 16
[2:52:05.880 --> 2:52:09.160]  this is the type of treatment that the cops have to put up with because
[2:52:09.160 --> 2:52:13.080]  liberals are above the law just like the officer that gets sexually
[2:52:13.080 --> 2:52:16.040]  molested by a liberal sexually molested in the
[2:52:16.040 --> 2:52:19.640]  streets but oh he's gay he's a liberal so he's allowed to do it
[2:52:19.640 --> 2:52:22.680]  this is the type of treatment the cops have to deal with from liberals
[2:52:22.680 --> 2:52:26.600]  because they're told by the democrats you don't touch our protesters
[2:52:26.600 --> 2:52:36.520]  here in clip 16
[2:52:36.520 --> 2:52:41.560]  so that's a crime you cannot put an amplified device in somebody's ear
[2:52:41.560 --> 2:52:48.520]  that's assault
[2:52:48.520 --> 2:52:51.960]  so the cop tries to stop him but he can't do an arrest because the democrats
[2:52:51.960 --> 2:52:58.520]  tell them you're not allowed to arrest their protesters
[2:52:58.520 --> 2:53:06.360]  so then he just assaults an officer
[2:53:06.360 --> 2:53:09.480]  and then he says cops and clan go hands in hand
[2:53:09.480 --> 2:53:12.920]  the klu Klux Klan made sure to put planned parenthoods in inner cities here
[2:53:12.920 --> 2:53:15.480]  pause it real quick so so i mean again folks like
[2:53:15.480 --> 2:53:19.400]  this is it's unbelievable the cops are not allowed
[2:53:19.400 --> 2:53:22.440]  to arrest democrat liberal activists they're told that
[2:53:22.440 --> 2:53:25.240]  and they've just learned through the process of time it's a waste of their
[2:53:25.240 --> 2:53:28.680]  time anyway they're going to get released when they get to the jail
[2:53:28.680 --> 2:53:32.200]  and okay so then this guy's out here assaulting officers with this amplified
[2:53:32.200 --> 2:53:34.920]  device putting in their faces putting in its citizens faces that's a crime
[2:53:34.920 --> 2:53:38.120]  folks that is a crime you cannot put an amplified sound device in somebody's
[2:53:38.120 --> 2:53:40.360]  ear that can cause permanent damage like tinnitus
[2:53:40.360 --> 2:53:43.800]  that's a crime liberals able to do it and then does it to a cop
[2:53:43.800 --> 2:53:47.640]  then he says cops are like the clan as he holds up a planned
[2:53:47.640 --> 2:53:52.280]  parenthood sign planned parenthood that intentionally
[2:53:52.280 --> 2:53:57.000]  made sure they put their centers in black areas so that they could make sure
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:54:00.520]  to call the black population and this guy's out here calling
[2:54:00.520 --> 2:54:05.320]  cops clan members as he promotes groups that the clan promoted planned
[2:54:05.320 --> 2:54:08.280]  parenthood to kill black people that still kill more black people than anyone
[2:54:08.280 --> 2:54:12.120]  else on this in this in this world planned parenthood democrats
[2:54:12.120 --> 2:54:15.400]  there's no one in the world that has killed more black people than democrats
[2:54:15.400 --> 2:54:18.440]  in planned parenthood nobody in the world
[2:54:18.440 --> 2:54:23.080]  oh the irony uh let's uh continue the clip here i'll let it finish
[2:54:23.080 --> 2:54:26.600]  cops that class go hand in hand cops that class go hand in hand
[2:54:26.600 --> 2:54:29.400]  cops that class go hand in hand
[2:54:29.400 --> 2:54:38.440]  tear that you f*** out tear clear f***ing job you belong here get us f***ed out
[2:54:38.440 --> 2:54:42.440]  and he continues to assault people with the amplified noise device in their face
[2:54:42.440 --> 2:54:53.320]  totally legal
[2:54:53.320 --> 2:54:59.080]  oh my gosh he loves abortion so much doesn't he
[2:54:59.080 --> 2:55:02.040]  all right that's enough guys i can't handle it either it goes on it just
[2:55:02.040 --> 2:55:05.720]  continues and then he starts grinding on cops again
[2:55:05.720 --> 2:55:08.600]  yeah there's market sanger founding a planned parenthood talking about how
[2:55:08.600 --> 2:55:12.200]  we're going to use planned parenthood to eliminate the black population
[2:55:12.200 --> 2:55:15.880]  and then these people go out claiming that they're against racism as they
[2:55:15.880 --> 2:55:20.200]  promote planned parenthood but um pro-life individuals are getting
[2:55:20.200 --> 2:55:22.680]  in the mix but again if you didn't see it the guy ends up
[2:55:22.680 --> 2:55:25.800]  literally grinding on the police officer again i mean i what these cops have to
[2:55:25.800 --> 2:55:28.600]  deal with these liberal psychopaths it's just
[2:55:28.600 --> 2:55:31.400]  it's so criminal they're forced to deal with this uh but here's some
[2:55:31.400 --> 2:55:34.360]  conservative pro-life people trying to stop the baby
[2:55:34.360 --> 2:55:50.520]  murderers here in clip 17
[2:55:50.520 --> 2:55:53.480]  i thought we had to listen to all women oh no only listen to them if they
[2:55:53.480 --> 2:55:58.200]  promote our propaganda believe all women only if
[2:55:58.200 --> 2:56:02.440]  they're talking of accusing republicans
[2:56:02.440 --> 2:56:05.400]  so good for that young girl for being out there
[2:56:05.400 --> 2:56:08.280]  and getting assaulted by these liberal psychopaths
[2:56:08.280 --> 2:56:14.280]  these liberal baby murders these liberal racists
[2:56:15.640 --> 2:56:18.680]  good for her for being out there all right one more here
[2:56:18.680 --> 2:56:21.320]  one more here's some more of the abortion protests
[2:56:21.320 --> 2:56:25.560]  in dc listen to what they're saying and uh tell me if if you said this if you
[2:56:25.560 --> 2:56:34.520]  would not be arrested here in clip 19
[2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:39.160]  be disrupted stand entrusted if you can
[2:56:39.160 --> 2:56:46.440]  cause commotion because we can stop this we can
[2:56:46.440 --> 2:56:51.720]  but we have to make them see us we have to be so large
[2:56:51.720 --> 2:56:55.640]  we have to be so large that they question
[2:56:55.640 --> 2:57:00.920]  whether or not they will be perceived as legitimate if they let this pass
[2:57:00.920 --> 2:57:04.840]  wow could you imagine if that was a conservative activist or a republican
[2:57:04.840 --> 2:57:08.120]  congressman or donald trump saying stuff like that boy oh boy
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:12.280]  they'd be called a domestic terrorist there'd be uh guns drawn raids there'd
[2:57:12.280 --> 2:57:16.760]  be arrest criminal prosecutions depositions hearings but liberals
[2:57:16.760 --> 2:57:19.960]  they're allowed to do it it's really frustrating isn't it folks
[2:57:19.960 --> 2:57:23.640]  and look we just all pray this comes to an end someday
[2:57:23.640 --> 2:57:27.160]  liberals and psychos and racists are always going to exist and they'll always
[2:57:27.160 --> 2:57:31.000]  make up the democrat party but you know it'd be nice to just have
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:34.360]  at least equal application of law and law enforcement
[2:57:34.360 --> 2:57:37.960]  at least april equal application of logic and how we
[2:57:37.960 --> 2:57:40.920]  deal with these things but we don't get any of that do we liberals are above the
[2:57:40.920 --> 2:57:44.600]  law they can break the law riot do violence
[2:57:44.600 --> 2:57:48.280]  terrorism and they're allowed there's an old better one saying

[3:00:12.680 --> 3:00:15.320]  consumption and i've been in media for uh
[3:00:15.320 --> 3:00:19.000]  almost 20 years now hard to believe even though i'm young spent most of my the
[3:00:19.000 --> 3:00:22.280]  majority of my life in media and so i understand
[3:00:22.280 --> 3:00:26.120]  when at when alex is out a lot of people aren't tuning in
[3:00:26.120 --> 3:00:29.640]  and when alex is out a lot of people aren't going to infowarstore.com to
[3:00:29.640 --> 3:00:33.800]  support us and so alex tends to go so numbers down
[3:00:33.800 --> 3:00:37.880]  and i won't say panics but uh you know has has the response spec
[3:00:37.880 --> 3:00:41.480]  because we've been real close to things not being so good
[3:00:41.480 --> 3:00:45.400]  and once we look like hey maybe we're gonna be in an operational capacity now
[3:00:45.400 --> 3:00:48.840]  and then he takes off and it's like ooh are we sliding down again

[3:06:37.240 --> 3:06:42.040]  into work i was listening to the radio and there was a song from 1982
[3:06:42.040 --> 3:06:45.400]  and it brought me right back to that year right
[3:06:45.400 --> 3:06:49.640]  and uh that was high school for me and i just remember
[3:06:49.640 --> 3:06:53.400]  just thinking you know you went to parties and went to the beach i grew up
[3:06:53.400 --> 3:06:56.680]  in california um yeah sorry anyway and i did all these
[3:06:56.680 --> 3:07:01.240]  things and wow things have changed wow

[3:07:05.480 --> 3:07:09.240]  and uh and honestly that's where we're kind of at right now
[3:07:09.240 --> 3:07:12.920]  what are we being lied to and i want to talk about sunscreen i want to talk
[3:07:12.920 --> 3:07:17.000]  about skin cancer and some things that might surprise you i think
[3:07:17.000 --> 3:07:22.600]  um also when we started out of course our summer for 2022
[3:07:22.600 --> 3:07:28.120]  we started out with a set of arrests right from the patriot front group okay
[3:07:28.120 --> 3:07:32.280]  and so i do want to talk about that um i just came off a week of camping it's
[3:07:32.280 --> 3:07:36.360]  like an exercise in homelessness i'm really good at it
[3:07:36.360 --> 3:07:40.040]  no i'm not i'm not really good at it but i love it and it's really nice to get
[3:07:40.040 --> 3:07:43.080]  away get away get into the mountains just get
[3:07:43.080 --> 3:07:47.240]  away from all the junk seriously it'll do a body good like just like milk right
[3:07:47.240 --> 3:07:51.160]  it'll do a body good i highly recommend going on vacation
[3:07:51.160 --> 3:07:54.520]  um but i but while i was gone we had this silly
[3:07:54.520 --> 3:07:58.600]  arrest this whole setup with the patriot front group and of course you had
[3:07:58.600 --> 3:08:02.600]  matching outfits matching gators matching hats matching
[3:08:02.600 --> 3:08:08.520]  khakis u-haul transpo you know when you when you look at real
[3:08:08.520 --> 3:08:12.040]  patriots when you understand who real patriots are it's like
[3:08:12.040 --> 3:08:16.040]  herding cats it's very difficult to get two people to
[3:08:16.040 --> 3:08:20.200]  even wear the same t-shirt let alone matching outfits all the way head to
[3:08:20.200 --> 3:08:23.480]  toe the people that design these groups
[3:08:23.480 --> 3:08:26.440]  whether it's feds or whether it's straight up
[3:08:26.440 --> 3:08:30.040]  liberal communist globalists you have a section
[3:08:30.040 --> 3:08:34.200]  of society that paints everything like they paint themselves so
[3:08:34.200 --> 3:08:37.800]  make these groups kind of look like a soft antifa
[3:08:37.800 --> 3:08:42.200]  and that's the problem is we're all going yeah that's not how we operate
[3:08:42.200 --> 3:08:46.920]  what we really need to do in this country is point out the obvious on groups
[3:08:46.920 --> 3:08:50.520]  like this right they're well funded somebody's at the helm when was the
[3:08:50.520 --> 3:08:53.240]  last time you were invited to a neighborhood party
[3:08:53.240 --> 3:08:56.280]  for the patriot front i'm guessing you weren't
[3:08:56.280 --> 3:09:00.120]  and so these groups are a little bit more exclusive right and
[3:09:00.120 --> 3:09:03.400]  whether they're taking really naive people and
[3:09:03.400 --> 3:09:06.600]  trying to set them up or whether these people are in on it
[3:09:06.600 --> 3:09:10.840]  i do have to say it's we either get this we either get the
[3:09:10.840 --> 3:09:15.480]  matching mini isis remember isis with the matching outfits and toyota trucks the
[3:09:15.480 --> 3:09:18.040]  white outfits they would never wear over in the middle east
[3:09:18.040 --> 3:09:22.920]  and then we get this or we get the feds the moronic feds the power
[3:09:22.920 --> 3:09:26.120]  hungry feds dressed up with their matching sunglasses in the long
[3:09:26.120 --> 3:09:28.840]  shorts with the t-shirts and they stand out and they
[3:09:28.840 --> 3:09:32.200]  look ridiculous but they love to follow orders so they're going to go do
[3:09:32.200 --> 3:09:35.640]  whatever they're told to do so that's the kind of thing
[3:09:35.640 --> 3:09:38.920]  that they paint us to be although the majority of the country
[3:09:38.920 --> 3:09:42.040]  really isn't that so i just wanted to point out that
[3:09:42.040 --> 3:09:45.960]  they have new groups like national action task force
[3:09:45.960 --> 3:09:49.640]  all these different groups the natf right
[3:09:49.640 --> 3:09:54.280]  pennsylvania avenue right there in washington dc i always like it when
[3:09:54.280 --> 3:09:57.560]  i'm a patriot and i go to the groups that are funded
[3:09:57.560 --> 3:10:02.200]  and warehouse in washington dc it just screams
[3:10:02.200 --> 3:10:05.880]  uh it came from natural sources right
[3:10:05.880 --> 3:10:10.440]  wrong so these state journal assemblies i'd be really careful about being
[3:10:10.440 --> 3:10:14.120]  hoodwinked into these types of groups because the minute you really start to
[3:10:14.120 --> 3:10:17.400]  organize then you have to then you have to ask yourself who's at the helm who's
[3:10:17.400 --> 3:10:20.360]  funding it and of course i know i'm preaching to the choir
[3:10:20.360 --> 3:10:24.760]  right now i know you all know this and as ridiculous as these people look
[3:10:24.760 --> 3:10:27.240]  whether they're being played or they're in on it
[3:10:27.240 --> 3:10:31.160]  um it's just a sad commentary on our nation that these are the people that
[3:10:31.160 --> 3:10:34.680]  design these groups and i love it when they say they're not part of
[3:10:34.680 --> 3:10:41.000]  corporate government but they're just investigators working
[3:10:41.000 --> 3:10:46.520]  with the fbi to help us sure i totally believe that
[3:10:46.520 --> 3:10:51.400]  don't you yes over in naive land we all believe it so
[3:10:51.400 --> 3:10:55.400]  as they get more ridiculous i actually think this stuff is getting easier to
[3:10:55.400 --> 3:11:00.920]  spot these groups are ridiculous looking and um
[3:11:00.920 --> 3:11:04.600]  anyway i i had a friend go over and interview them and
[3:11:04.600 --> 3:11:08.600]  my friend todd and he said you know what these groups
[3:11:08.600 --> 3:11:12.360]  these aren't the guys these aren't the the hateful guys
[3:11:12.360 --> 3:11:17.160]  okay these are guys basically either being warped into this or
[3:11:17.160 --> 3:11:22.280]  used you know or set up so you know anyway you go somebody's at the helm
[3:11:22.280 --> 3:11:25.240]  doing this all right so i want to talk a little bit
[3:11:25.240 --> 3:11:29.720]  about sunscreen to you because i am a person that has had many um
[3:11:29.720 --> 3:11:33.000]  cancers removed right pre-cancers removed all kinds
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  and so my whole life i grew up at the beach and i stuck out because i was so
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:40.200]  pale dark hair here's all my friends they look like
[3:11:40.200 --> 3:11:44.040]  you know barbies and uh and and here i am on the beach
[3:11:44.040 --> 3:11:47.640]  so of course very burnt all the time but as i was
[3:11:47.640 --> 3:11:50.920]  on vacation and i was watching kids get slathered up
[3:11:50.920 --> 3:11:58.360]  and i mean slathered and gassed with with sunscreen moms just you know
[3:11:58.360 --> 3:12:02.600]  just i mean they they honestly they were inhaling it i was really kind of
[3:12:02.600 --> 3:12:05.800]  fearful for these kids um but i thought you know
[3:12:05.800 --> 3:12:09.400]  there's something very wrong with this whole industry because as i was
[3:12:09.400 --> 3:12:12.120]  starting to look back at the rates and the numbers
[3:12:12.120 --> 3:12:15.640]  something really stuck out to me and that was
[3:12:15.640 --> 3:12:19.720]  they started regulating and kind of putting it out there and saying that
[3:12:19.720 --> 3:12:24.120]  you need it and it was recommended um that we should start taking
[3:12:24.120 --> 3:12:28.920]  the sunscreen products right and every every time we were in the sun
[3:12:28.920 --> 3:12:32.360]  and i find it interesting that in our in our whole
[3:12:32.360 --> 3:12:38.280]  evolution of of personhood we spent more time in the fields and
[3:12:38.280 --> 3:12:43.160]  had 95% farmers on 95% of us were farmers and ranchers and
[3:12:43.160 --> 3:12:47.880]  everything else about 100 years ago so i find it kind of interesting
[3:12:47.880 --> 3:12:53.480]  that all all along we were the the rate for sun cancer was actually
[3:12:53.480 --> 3:12:58.120]  really low skin cancer really really really low and it stayed low
[3:12:58.120 --> 3:13:03.880]  up until the 70s right about the time that they started recommending
[3:13:03.880 --> 3:13:09.160]  sunscreen and sunscreen has a lot of different ingredients in it
[3:13:09.160 --> 3:13:14.280]  and parents out there are basically gassing their kids and as the kid tries
[3:13:14.280 --> 3:13:16.920]  to turn around the kid's so desperate to go in the pool he'll do
[3:13:16.920 --> 3:13:22.040]  anything so if the if the mom is slathering them up and then spraying them
[3:13:22.040 --> 3:13:26.920]  and then slathering and then spraying this poor kid gets into the water right
[3:13:26.920 --> 3:13:30.440]  and this kid's got all these chemicals on him all day long now
[3:13:30.440 --> 3:13:34.840]  i'm not an epa i can't stand the epa i think they're a total joke
[3:13:34.840 --> 3:13:39.080]  but the epa came out and they said these things were safe
[3:13:39.080 --> 3:13:43.400]  hmm yeah okay um everybody says they're safe the fda
[3:13:43.400 --> 3:13:46.680]  it's actually classified as a drug everybody says these are safe for the
[3:13:46.680 --> 3:13:51.080]  environment they're totally safe and i'm not an environment nut
[3:13:51.080 --> 3:13:56.040]  but what i did notice was as the rates of cancer increased it went from like
[3:13:56.040 --> 3:14:01.000]  one in a hundred thousand okay when we were all out in the sun enjoying ourselves
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:04.200]  and and granted we were wearing a lot more clothes because
[3:14:04.200 --> 3:14:08.120]  you know going around half naked really wasn't you know the thing to do
[3:14:08.120 --> 3:14:11.880]  but at the same time we did spend a lot of time in the sun
[3:14:11.880 --> 3:14:15.560]  and so it went from one in one hundred thousand all the way up to about
[3:14:15.560 --> 3:14:19.640]  forty three in one hundred thousand that's a lot
[3:14:19.640 --> 3:14:22.840]  and i noticed that in some of the states like florida and arizona
[3:14:22.840 --> 3:14:26.840]  it was actually the rates are actually look they're not super high
[3:14:26.840 --> 3:14:31.000]  okay kind of interesting because you have a lot of sun in these areas
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:35.000]  but i also noticed along the way that i had cancers in places that
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:38.280]  though the sun wasn't well how could that be
[3:14:38.280 --> 3:14:41.880]  so a lot of people have questions about these things and i would have to say
[3:14:41.880 --> 3:14:46.840]  go back to the rates of of of cancer when it exploded
[3:14:46.840 --> 3:14:51.080]  and that was in the 70s when they said you know start using sunscreen
[3:14:51.080 --> 3:14:54.360]  also zinc oxide a lot of benzene
[3:14:54.360 --> 3:14:58.680]  that was the chemical responsible they said for causing skin cancer right
[3:14:58.680 --> 3:15:03.000]  also they had a couple of different ones actually there's like a list of these
[3:15:03.000 --> 3:15:07.240]  and you can do your own research but oxybenzone
[3:15:07.240 --> 3:15:11.480]  all of these different things inside these sunscreens are actually
[3:15:11.480 --> 3:15:15.640]  really toxic and they think they're actually causing cancers
[3:15:15.640 --> 3:15:19.320]  are we doing things to actually cause cancer thinking that we're blocking out
[3:15:19.320 --> 3:15:22.840]  the ultraviolet hmm so you should be spending about
[3:15:22.840 --> 3:15:27.240]  at least 20 to 30 minutes in the sun without anything on you and as you start
[3:15:27.240 --> 3:15:30.360]  to get a little pink maybe get out of the sun or get a hat
[3:15:30.360 --> 3:15:33.160]  but i don't think i'd slather myself up with chemicals anymore
[3:15:33.160 --> 3:15:36.360]  i think it's causing more cancer than we think and that's coming from somebody
[3:15:36.360 --> 3:15:40.840]  who has actually had skin cancers removed i'm just saying you might want to
[3:15:40.840 --> 3:15:44.360]  watch it a little bit hmm and get some good
[3:15:44.360 --> 3:15:47.880]  good vitamin d this is the time to do it this is the window i'll be right back
[3:15:47.880 --> 3:15:52.520]  i'm k dally for the alex jones show be right back

[3:17:55.960 --> 3:17:59.160]  you know it's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s
[3:17:59.160 --> 3:18:02.600]  when the internet and mobile technology first came out which is
[3:18:02.600 --> 3:18:05.000]  we thought you know this is going to level the playing field everybody's
[3:18:05.000 --> 3:18:07.240]  going to have access to the same information everybody's going to be
[3:18:07.240 --> 3:18:11.000]  able to freely communicate that information that's our goal
[3:18:11.000 --> 3:18:15.960]  to get back to that place where we all have access to all the information
[3:18:15.960 --> 3:18:19.320]  we all have the ability to freely communicate that information
[3:18:19.320 --> 3:18:23.560]  with whomever we want whenever we want and we don't have to worry about
[3:18:23.560 --> 3:18:28.280]  anybody tracking what we're doing and trying to judge us or categorize us
[3:18:28.280 --> 3:18:33.400]  or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations we're
[3:18:33.400 --> 3:18:36.440]  having because of the internet searches that we're doing
[3:18:36.440 --> 3:18:40.600]  because of the discussions the people we want to talk to about these things
[3:18:40.600 --> 3:18:44.040]  so that's our goal is to help people take back their freedom
[3:18:44.040 --> 3:18:47.000]  by helping them to take back their privacy and so that's really what we're
[3:18:47.000 --> 3:18:51.080]  trying to do and so I hope that everybody listening
[3:18:51.080 --> 3:18:54.920]  will check us out at boltowireless.com that's v-o-l-t-a
[3:18:54.920 --> 3:18:58.520]  wireless.com I don't care if you work in a cafeteria
[3:18:58.520 --> 3:19:02.120]  or pump gas or whether you're a farmer a rancher a doctor a lawyer or a
[3:19:02.120 --> 3:19:05.640]  millionaire fortune and money magazine have all done these
[3:19:05.640 --> 3:19:09.000]  profiles you see it every year 30 different tax returns 30 different
[3:19:09.000 --> 3:19:12.280]  answers 50 different tax returns 50 different answers
[3:19:12.280 --> 3:19:16.360]  and almost all of them just screw you over especially the big firms
[3:19:16.360 --> 3:19:19.480]  and and the big tax groups because they're part of the system and they
[3:19:19.480 --> 3:19:22.440]  don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this
[3:19:22.440 --> 3:19:25.880]  so it's a very important situation with inflation
[3:19:25.880 --> 3:19:29.960]  all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to
[3:19:29.960 --> 3:19:33.560]  do things tax wise it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your
[3:19:33.560 --> 3:19:37.160]  money we wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice
[3:19:37.160 --> 3:19:41.400]  in the last few years the only way you fail is not
[3:19:41.400 --> 3:19:46.360]  writing down the url jonestaxrelief.com one word jonestaxrelief.com
[3:19:46.360 --> 3:19:54.680]  or call 833-904-285 833-904-285
[3:19:54.680 --> 3:20:01.720]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[3:20:01.720 --> 3:20:05.160]  it's alex jones
[3:20:10.360 --> 3:20:13.800]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm kate dally your guest host from kate
[3:20:13.800 --> 3:20:17.880]  dally radio dot com so glad to be with you i hope you're
[3:20:17.880 --> 3:20:22.600]  actually having a fun summer despite the crap fest that we're living under
[3:20:22.600 --> 3:20:26.360]  it's um it's interesting i saw deniro uh deniro
[3:20:26.360 --> 3:20:30.840]  four foot two deniro i saw him on tv uh saying that biden was just doing the
[3:20:30.840 --> 3:20:35.240]  best he could do king fraud lots doing the best he can do with the situation
[3:20:35.240 --> 3:20:40.040]  you mean the one he created uh anyway i i go back to
[3:20:40.040 --> 3:20:44.360]  summer lies because we're told so many and i actually had to pick a few
[3:20:44.360 --> 3:20:48.840]  because it's that many it's that bad um but ask yourself this question as i was
[3:20:48.840 --> 3:20:54.120]  just talking about uh sunscreen if sunscreen helps
[3:20:54.120 --> 3:20:58.840]  why didn't the cancer rate ever come down why did it just keep going up
[3:20:58.840 --> 3:21:03.400]  because in the press all they ever do is say oh we've extended the life of
[3:21:03.400 --> 3:21:07.800]  skin cancer patients they live five years longer or the ones that
[3:21:07.800 --> 3:21:11.640]  ones back in the 70s wouldn't have lived as long as they do now because of
[3:21:11.640 --> 3:21:15.240]  pharmacia i just call it pharmacia might as well just go right to source rate
[3:21:15.240 --> 3:21:18.840]  but anyway pharmacia isn't that interesting so
[3:21:18.840 --> 3:21:22.680]  why didn't it help if everybody thinks it helps
[3:21:22.680 --> 3:21:27.080]  and everybody's standing there with their ginormous can of sunscreen
[3:21:27.080 --> 3:21:31.960]  why didn't the rate ever go down because it really hasn't it's only gone up
[3:21:31.960 --> 3:21:35.320]  and if it's only gone up since the 70s when they started recommending it
[3:21:35.320 --> 3:21:38.600]  i think somebody needs to make some sort of correlation
[3:21:38.600 --> 3:21:42.920]  and they are dr mercola one of my favorites um he talked about the fact
[3:21:42.920 --> 3:21:47.640]  that the cancer society has been bought by cosmetics giants
[3:21:47.640 --> 3:21:51.480]  like nutrigina for $200,000 with the supposed goal
[3:21:51.480 --> 3:21:55.800]  of helping to educate the public about the importance of sunscreen
[3:21:55.800 --> 3:21:59.240]  but in reality it's just a marketing ploy for nutrigina which will help them
[3:21:59.240 --> 3:22:03.160]  increase their sunscreen sales by millions this is how it works
[3:22:03.160 --> 3:22:07.800]  isn't that sad they get to even put the acs logo on their advertising because
[3:22:07.800 --> 3:22:11.240]  they can say well you know because of the agreements they made
[3:22:11.240 --> 3:22:14.920]  really for profit were the ones that get stung
[3:22:14.920 --> 3:22:20.120]  and in 2014 they came out and they said consumer reports advise parents to avoid
[3:22:20.120 --> 3:22:25.240]  spraying their kids up with sunscreen because you know the motto
[3:22:25.240 --> 3:22:28.920]  less is more no no no more is more more is more
[3:22:28.920 --> 3:22:32.920]  and they're spraying their kids continuously through the day too
[3:22:32.920 --> 3:22:36.120]  maybe not so smart maybe just spend a little less time outside
[3:22:36.120 --> 3:22:39.640]  but when you are outside get some actual vitamin d in your system
[3:22:39.640 --> 3:22:44.280]  our vitamin d levels are really low and we also had a vaccination program
[3:22:44.280 --> 3:22:48.120]  in america that started in the 70s interesting
[3:22:48.120 --> 3:22:51.560]  so as our immune systems were going in the tanker
[3:22:51.560 --> 3:22:56.360]  right we have all of these different kinds of cancers
[3:22:56.360 --> 3:23:00.840]  shooting up hmm wonder if there's a correlation
[3:23:00.840 --> 3:23:04.920]  interesting all right let's talk about ethanol for just a moment because
[3:23:04.920 --> 3:23:08.200]  everybody's noticing that a you go to the gas station
[3:23:08.200 --> 3:23:12.120]  the gas doesn't really smell strong like gas used to
[3:23:12.120 --> 3:23:15.080]  hmm you aren't getting the mileage you used to
[3:23:15.080 --> 3:23:21.240]  hmm why is that well eric peters autos i love eric because he's a libertarian
[3:23:21.240 --> 3:23:24.200]  and a car expert and i've had him i've actually interviewed him before and
[3:23:24.200 --> 3:23:27.160]  he's amazing but he was answering this question to
[3:23:27.160 --> 3:23:31.320]  somebody who was asking him about the watered down ethanol that we seem to
[3:23:31.320 --> 3:23:35.560]  love in our country now no no one loves it actually no just the fraud a lot
[3:23:35.560 --> 3:23:39.240]  administration and who's behind fraud a lot decided that
[3:23:39.240 --> 3:23:42.920]  they wanted to implement a very high level of ethanol
[3:23:42.920 --> 3:23:46.600]  that isn't so good for our cars so older cars he said like your
[3:23:46.600 --> 3:23:50.200]  yours are mine were built before the government began to adulterate gas and
[3:23:50.200 --> 3:23:53.640]  water down its energy content with ethanol and when you put
[3:23:53.640 --> 3:23:59.000]  e 10 90 percent gas 10 percent ethanol in a tank like yours and
[3:23:59.000 --> 3:24:04.120]  now it's 15 percent okay you're feeding it a lean fuel mixture and
[3:24:04.120 --> 3:24:07.080]  the only way to correct this is to rejet the carburetor
[3:24:07.080 --> 3:24:11.880]  and stop using e 10 or find an unadulterated gas
[3:24:11.880 --> 3:24:17.160]  good advice he also says another problem with ethanol in older vehicles
[3:24:17.160 --> 3:24:22.120]  designed before it became common common practice you know to water it down
[3:24:22.120 --> 3:24:25.400]  is is that alcohol is very very corrosive
[3:24:25.400 --> 3:24:29.960]  and i had this suspicion because you know it takes like 20 25 years
[3:24:29.960 --> 3:24:33.160]  for people to catch on to new ideas how long did it take us to get
[3:24:33.160 --> 3:24:38.280]  computers in our homes about 25 years okay we're not very quick on the uptake
[3:24:38.280 --> 3:24:41.400]  it took a decade to get people even into facebook
[3:24:41.400 --> 3:24:44.360]  okay even to check it out because everybody started going there but it
[3:24:44.360 --> 3:24:48.520]  takes a significant amount of time but they really want
[3:24:48.520 --> 3:24:52.600]  very asinine electric cars to become
[3:24:52.600 --> 3:24:56.840]  the car right and they do want to get rid of an entire industry
[3:24:56.840 --> 3:24:59.880]  but how do you do that when everyone has cars
[3:24:59.880 --> 3:25:04.600]  do you just ruin them that would make it a lot faster
[3:25:04.600 --> 3:25:09.960]  right and there's no way right to fix that because
[3:25:09.960 --> 3:25:13.560]  all of the gas not all so i'm going to give you a website to go to
[3:25:13.560 --> 3:25:17.160]  to get gas that has not been watered down with ethanol
[3:25:17.160 --> 3:25:20.520]  and you can find a gas station near you that hasn't done it yet
[3:25:20.520 --> 3:25:24.040]  and save your car because cars like yours and mine
[3:25:24.040 --> 3:25:27.160]  and others made you know before the mid-late you know
[3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:31.480]  1890s he says do not have fuel systems designed to safely handle
[3:25:31.480 --> 3:25:35.480]  alcohol doused gas it ruins the carburetor parts it ruins
[3:25:35.480 --> 3:25:40.680]  it ruins plastic parts it really really really ruins a lot of different things
[3:25:40.680 --> 3:25:45.320]  and so the steel fuel tanks and the lines are really vulnerable to internal
[3:25:45.320 --> 3:25:49.480]  corrosion and the rust flakes will eventually flake off and go downstream
[3:25:49.480 --> 3:25:54.360]  right into your carburetor so rubber parts accelerator pumps
[3:25:54.360 --> 3:25:57.880]  rubber fuel lines he says get a new fuel pump right now
[3:25:57.880 --> 3:26:01.160]  he says if you haven't replaced it get a new one right now
[3:26:01.160 --> 3:26:04.200]  because it's probably ruining the seal he's pretty sure
[3:26:04.200 --> 3:26:07.960]  and then also just maybe update some of the
[3:26:07.960 --> 3:26:11.400]  some of the parts he's replaced some of the parts in his own cars and you can
[3:26:11.400 --> 3:26:15.320]  find out more at eric peters motors but i absolutely love him because he gave
[3:26:15.320 --> 3:26:19.880]  out a website called pure-gas.org
[3:26:19.880 --> 3:26:26.360]  pure-gas.org and this website helps you find gas pumps in your area in your city
[3:26:26.360 --> 3:26:30.920]  and by the state that actually have gas that is not infused
[3:26:30.920 --> 3:26:34.280]  at this high level of ethanol that we're having to deal with now
[3:26:34.280 --> 3:26:37.880]  and you probably noticed you're not getting the mileage one thing
[3:26:37.880 --> 3:26:41.480]  the people in my family noticed is yeah the mileage was way down you're not
[3:26:41.480 --> 3:26:45.000]  getting out of a tank of gas what you would normally get
[3:26:45.000 --> 3:26:49.800]  and so we had the mandates coming forth after the
[3:26:49.800 --> 3:26:55.000]  induction of the EPA in the 70s you guys realized that was all built on a lie
[3:26:55.000 --> 3:26:59.880]  right now a 1966 oil spill that was cleaning up itself
[3:26:59.880 --> 3:27:03.400]  right basically within five years would have cleaned up itself
[3:27:03.400 --> 3:27:06.520]  they took that event off the shore of california
[3:27:06.520 --> 3:27:10.360]  and turned that into a 10 000 person at the start
[3:27:10.360 --> 3:27:14.920]  EPA that it only took them six months to put into place because they'd already had
[3:27:14.920 --> 3:27:19.560]  it ready to go. Government moves really fast when
[3:27:19.560 --> 3:27:22.600]  they want to when they want to build a wall but they
[3:27:22.600 --> 3:27:25.800]  don't want to build a wall they never build a wall but when they want to start
[3:27:25.800 --> 3:27:30.280]  a 10 000 group EPA to regulate the hell out of us
[3:27:30.280 --> 3:27:38.200]  yeah it's dunski so yeah great anyway the so the EPA did the renewable fuel
[3:27:38.200 --> 3:27:44.120]  standard back in 78 and this is what started to force ethanol into the fuel
[3:27:44.120 --> 3:27:49.320]  supply they knew they were going to ruin vehicles
[3:27:49.320 --> 3:27:52.600]  they knew it so go get gas where you can and
[3:27:52.600 --> 3:27:56.840]  or you can still buy 100 gasoline you'll get more mileage it'll be better on
[3:27:56.840 --> 3:28:01.240]  your car and the website again was pure-gas.org
[3:28:01.240 --> 3:28:04.200]  I think it's really helpful to know these things because right now
[3:28:04.200 --> 3:28:08.200]  as we fight back on all of this garbage and the
[3:28:08.200 --> 3:28:12.520]  definite implosion of our country under globalist communist let's be real
[3:28:12.520 --> 3:28:16.760]  globalist comm communist rule we have to know how to fight back
[3:28:16.760 --> 3:28:20.440]  and what to do to save ourselves and our neighbors and so
[3:28:20.440 --> 3:28:23.560]  you know what this is one way that we can really get on board
[3:28:23.560 --> 3:28:27.560]  and actually do something to help right now every single day
[3:28:27.560 --> 3:28:31.080]  there's a lot more we can do because the fight's going to look very very
[3:28:31.080 --> 3:28:35.160]  different on a lot of different landscapes as we as we move forward
[3:28:35.160 --> 3:28:38.520]  it's not going to look like patriot front I'll tell you that much
[3:28:38.520 --> 3:28:41.800]  it's not going to look like that be a little more stealthy
[3:28:41.800 --> 3:28:45.880]  be a little more underground because these people really want to
[3:28:45.880 --> 3:28:49.480]  gaslight us out I'll be right back I'm Kate Dally your guest host don't go
[3:28:49.480 --> 3:28:52.440]  anywhere I have so much more to give you on
[3:28:52.440 --> 3:29:00.920]  summer lies stay to I'm a humble person and I want to say that I'm just a man
[3:29:00.920 --> 3:29:05.400]  but I'm not just a man just like you no matter what color you are whether you're
[3:29:05.400 --> 3:29:08.680]  a man or a woman you were made by the creator of the universe
[3:29:08.680 --> 3:29:12.360]  who had a plan for you who has a destiny for you
[3:29:12.360 --> 3:29:16.360]  that's why the system hates you and fears you that's why they hate me
[3:29:16.360 --> 3:29:20.760]  it's because the spirit I carry is one of justice and truth and courage and
[3:29:20.760 --> 3:29:24.440]  honor and will and love my friends the enemy's coming
[3:29:24.440 --> 3:29:28.360]  after me not because I'm a loser but because I'm a winner
[3:29:28.360 --> 3:29:32.120]  they're coming after you not because you're a bad person because you're a
[3:29:32.120 --> 3:29:36.360]  good person because you love God and God loves you
[3:29:36.360 --> 3:29:39.320]  and so I signed up for this I signed up for this fight

[3:33:14.360 --> 3:33:17.320]  today i'm kate deli your guest host for this hour
[3:33:17.320 --> 3:33:21.960]  and we're talking about summer lies and i mean some woppers some things we've
[3:33:21.960 --> 3:33:25.400]  never had to deal with in the past i know you're you're you're kind of craving
[3:33:25.400 --> 3:33:28.200]  like the summers from the 70s and the 80s
[3:33:28.200 --> 3:33:32.120]  right right about now i am i know i seriously am
[3:33:32.120 --> 3:33:35.560]  it's been it's it's tough and it's tough to see
[3:33:35.560 --> 3:33:39.080]  as i was just talking about like the renewable fuel standard
[3:33:39.080 --> 3:33:43.080]  um you're not going to see republicans go up against this
[3:33:43.080 --> 3:33:47.080]  i am a republican i'm a registered republican in my state
[3:33:47.080 --> 3:33:51.160]  but i know what a farset is i know that we have two parties
[3:33:51.160 --> 3:33:55.320]  working for the destruction of america right now i mean let's be honest right
[3:33:55.320 --> 3:33:58.840]  they're not going to do anything about it this is why every single bad lie
[3:33:58.840 --> 3:34:04.600]  every single thing that they try to do okay never gets taken away in 120 years
[3:34:04.600 --> 3:34:09.240]  we've never ever seen government when party a or party b's in
[3:34:09.240 --> 3:34:13.880]  and party a or party b is the good guy or the bad guy when good guy or bad guy
[3:34:13.880 --> 3:34:18.520]  gets in they don't reverse anything that the other team put into place
[3:34:18.520 --> 3:34:21.880]  they just complain a lot and use a lot of scapegoats but you're not going to see
[3:34:21.880 --> 3:34:24.040]  anything happen just like you're not going to see
[3:34:24.040 --> 3:34:29.800]  our dear republicans go election fraud or hey the economy or hey
[3:34:29.800 --> 3:34:33.640]  gas prices everyone puts their head in the sand gets their paycheck probably
[3:34:33.640 --> 3:34:37.400]  from pharma and then goes to sleep and tells you they're working hard
[3:34:37.400 --> 3:34:41.240]  i always love that phrase um working hard no you're not
[3:34:41.240 --> 3:34:44.280]  you're just taking a paycheck to shut up that's what you're doing
[3:34:44.280 --> 3:34:49.160]  so we have that and then we also have the those arrests that we talked about
[3:34:49.160 --> 3:34:52.840]  the arrests why the arrests why do they want that they want to be able to paint
[3:34:52.840 --> 3:34:56.200]  a picture of us they want to be able to january six us
[3:34:56.200 --> 3:35:00.840]  and that is is to trump up charges right and to make it look like
[3:35:00.840 --> 3:35:06.040]  or the violent thugs like antifa like a soft antifa
[3:35:06.040 --> 3:35:09.720]  problem is is that we're not so they have to lie to do it
[3:35:09.720 --> 3:35:13.720]  they actually have to create groups to do it and that's my message for
[3:35:13.720 --> 3:35:18.200]  all of the groups from the feds and from the cia that have to put out
[3:35:18.200 --> 3:35:21.880]  lies in order to entrap people how sad are they
[3:35:21.880 --> 3:35:25.560]  what treasonous little thugs are they that have to
[3:35:25.560 --> 3:35:31.080]  that have to lie to entrap sick it's a sick game they're playing
[3:35:31.080 --> 3:35:34.040]  problem is they don't realize they're subject to the same government
[3:35:34.040 --> 3:35:39.000]  that they're helping to create and empower that's the problem
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:42.680]  so i also had an audience member ask me you know what is it what
[3:35:42.680 --> 3:35:48.280]  aren't people fighting good question what does that fight look like though
[3:35:48.280 --> 3:35:52.280]  we had to have a physical fight in order to get this land in order to get the
[3:35:52.280 --> 3:35:55.560]  united states but that doesn't always mean that
[3:35:55.560 --> 3:35:59.080]  everything has to be done that way we already have the constitution
[3:35:59.080 --> 3:36:02.920]  we already have this country so what is the fake fight or what does the fight
[3:36:02.920 --> 3:36:06.120]  mean now not fake fight but what does the fight mean now
[3:36:06.120 --> 3:36:10.440]  it doesn't mean fake fighting it means real fighting but in a
[3:36:10.440 --> 3:36:14.680]  much stealthier way are you preparing for what's coming
[3:36:14.680 --> 3:36:19.960]  are you basically taking steps to ensure that your family can eat
[3:36:19.960 --> 3:36:24.200]  have a vehicle have gas have all of these things are you insuring that are
[3:36:24.200 --> 3:36:27.560]  you and are you basically setting forth a people's
[3:36:27.560 --> 3:36:31.640]  reset not their great rate reset no but the people's
[3:36:31.640 --> 3:36:36.680]  reset somebody asked me you know why all the
[3:36:36.680 --> 3:36:43.400]  companies are jumping on board for the june the juneathon of i call it the
[3:36:43.400 --> 3:36:48.280]  juneathon ghost sodom you know basically month okay
[3:36:48.280 --> 3:36:51.800]  and i said because that's how they're going to get money in the future
[3:36:51.800 --> 3:36:55.960]  in the great reset in order to have money as a company in order to get loans in
[3:36:55.960 --> 3:37:00.280]  order to get all these things you have to sign on you have to absolutely sign
[3:37:00.280 --> 3:37:03.800]  on and say that you will be all for inclusion all
[3:37:03.800 --> 3:37:08.120]  for equality even though equality looks really weird not the kind of equality
[3:37:08.120 --> 3:37:12.360]  you're thinking and if they don't go ghost
[3:37:12.360 --> 3:37:15.240]  sodom if they if they're not all on board
[3:37:15.240 --> 3:37:19.240]  they don't get to maybe bank in the future maybe they can't process payments
[3:37:19.240 --> 3:37:23.160]  maybe they can't get loans maybe they can't grow so everybody's going all in
[3:37:23.160 --> 3:37:26.760]  on paper and making it look like hey our company
[3:37:26.760 --> 3:37:30.360]  is all in man we are going to toe the line
[3:37:30.360 --> 3:37:33.720]  because we never saw companies do that before they never got
[3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:38.520]  politically agendized before but now it's in the great reset it's all for the
[3:37:38.520 --> 3:37:41.400]  cash so they have to look like they're doing this
[3:37:41.400 --> 3:37:45.480]  just like um you know it's funny it's like uh it reminds me of the iowa
[3:37:45.480 --> 3:37:50.760]  governor right what a mess hot mess um basically a couple of months ago saying
[3:37:50.760 --> 3:37:53.640]  hey um we're going to offer gasoline with higher
[3:37:53.640 --> 3:37:57.960]  blends of the ethanol we're gonna we're gonna boost the state's biofuels
[3:37:57.960 --> 3:38:01.640]  industry hmm that's interesting and tout a cheaper
[3:38:01.640 --> 3:38:04.520]  fuel option that's how it was presented in the press
[3:38:04.520 --> 3:38:09.000]  okay but the law also includes tax credits
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:12.600]  ooh money uh with four higher blends of ethanol
[3:38:12.600 --> 3:38:16.600]  for pushing this on your customers how sad is that
[3:38:16.600 --> 3:38:21.160]  they also said it would tweak iowa's renewable fuel infrastructure program
[3:38:21.160 --> 3:38:25.800]  to provide more generous cost sharing that means people are getting a paycheck
[3:38:25.800 --> 3:38:29.960]  for smaller gas stations that want to use the the state
[3:38:29.960 --> 3:38:34.600]  grant program here little city have some cash
[3:38:34.600 --> 3:38:37.640]  to further this agenda it's how it's always done
[3:38:37.640 --> 3:38:41.400]  and we all know this right if you're watching info wars and you watch the
[3:38:41.400 --> 3:38:45.000]  alex joneshow you know this i'm preaching to the choir
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:49.080]  a lot of people out there don't know it because they can't see what's coming
[3:38:49.080 --> 3:38:53.160]  the art of being an american is to be able to see what's coming in to prepare
[3:38:53.160 --> 3:38:56.360]  for it and to be able to fight it effectively
[3:38:56.360 --> 3:38:59.560]  okay if these people are constantly outed
[3:38:59.560 --> 3:39:04.520]  if all of the election fraud is outed if these things are constantly put into
[3:39:04.520 --> 3:39:08.440]  the light it's a great way to fight what's happening
[3:39:08.440 --> 3:39:12.120]  they have a lot of minions that have to carry out the plans in order for them
[3:39:12.120 --> 3:39:14.680]  to work and they have to do it for a paycheck
[3:39:14.680 --> 3:39:18.040]  so small businesses should be saying no to these grants
[3:39:18.040 --> 3:39:21.720]  no to these strings that's a great way to fight
[3:39:21.720 --> 3:39:25.640]  to fight this system that they want to implement these globalist communists
[3:39:25.640 --> 3:39:30.200]  okay if we don't do that then we're suckered in if we keep wearing a mask
[3:39:30.200 --> 3:39:33.800]  two and a half late two and a half years later like a total moron
[3:39:33.800 --> 3:39:37.400]  we are suckering into that we're saying yeah we believe you
[3:39:37.400 --> 3:39:40.760]  we're in fear even though no one around us is dropping dead
[3:39:40.760 --> 3:39:44.360]  we're in fear so we continue to wear the mask
[3:39:44.360 --> 3:39:48.200]  every single time we go along with the this agenda every single time we play
[3:39:48.200 --> 3:39:52.280]  along and act like we believe in it it gives them power and strength
[3:39:52.280 --> 3:39:56.040]  and then more people jump on but it can also work in the reverse too
[3:39:56.040 --> 3:40:00.280]  and the people need to have their own reset so right now as you're preparing
[3:40:00.280 --> 3:40:04.120]  are you basically storing up batteries for your cars
[3:40:04.120 --> 3:40:08.440]  spark plugs brake rotors are you working on getting a sets of tires
[3:40:08.440 --> 3:40:12.520]  put aside all of those things right now besides food
[3:40:12.520 --> 3:40:16.040]  storage i would absolutely work on i would also go
[3:40:16.040 --> 3:40:19.800]  into alex jones store and buy the supplements in bulk
[3:40:19.800 --> 3:40:23.000]  because with winter coming and with the fall coming
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:26.760]  this summer is a great time to get it right now before all the shortages
[3:40:26.760 --> 3:40:29.640]  really start to kick in and then it's really hard to get
[3:40:29.640 --> 3:40:33.480]  all kinds of things right on our shelves so right now as everyone's trying to
[3:40:33.480 --> 3:40:36.840]  vacation and they're trying to get on the airplanes because there's no
[3:40:36.840 --> 3:40:41.720]  masks what a joke um we need to be preparing
[3:40:41.720 --> 3:40:44.520]  and this is a great lesson that's learned you know we have all of these
[3:40:44.520 --> 3:40:48.200]  different food companies going by the wayside smith
[3:40:48.200 --> 3:40:52.200]  fields jbs foods it's china owned okay and all
[3:40:52.200 --> 3:40:55.320]  of a sudden they're closing up stock closing up shop
[3:40:55.320 --> 3:41:00.440]  and they're also not buying calves to stock the feed lots
[3:41:00.440 --> 3:41:05.080]  what does that translate to that translate to this time next year
[3:41:05.080 --> 3:41:08.680]  not having the food or having the food be so expensive you can't eat it
[3:41:08.680 --> 3:41:13.400]  that's a problem right now it's already expensive enough
[3:41:13.400 --> 3:41:17.160]  that you can't afford a lot of things can you imagine what it's going to be
[3:41:17.160 --> 3:41:21.000]  like this time next year because right now they're not preparing
[3:41:21.000 --> 3:41:24.600]  they're not doing things to have that food supply keep coming
[3:41:24.600 --> 3:41:29.240]  the way it's been coming so with jbs foods closing up shops in
[3:41:29.240 --> 3:41:34.360]  different areas with local kill plants are hard to start
[3:41:34.360 --> 3:41:38.680]  up because you have to have fda approval that's not coming easily down the pike
[3:41:38.680 --> 3:41:43.560]  right um so we have a lot of problems in this area we also
[3:41:43.560 --> 3:41:48.120]  have um if you look back to 2019 they had 10
[3:41:48.120 --> 3:41:51.880]  incidences of fires now 10 fires in a year
[3:41:51.880 --> 3:41:54.840]  okay i could go with that i could say yeah that's a coincidence for the
[3:41:54.840 --> 3:41:58.200]  coincidence theorists out there that's a coincidence
[3:41:58.200 --> 3:42:05.720]  almost 100 now 99 something's wrong that's planned
[3:42:05.720 --> 3:42:11.560]  you and i both know it it's planned the destruction of our food supply comes
[3:42:11.560 --> 3:42:14.920]  from a lot of excuses and scapegoating and lies
[3:42:14.920 --> 3:42:19.640]  but that's all king fraud a lot knows right king fraud a lot and his little
[3:42:19.640 --> 3:42:23.000]  group of cronies that are really running the show
[3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:28.520]  because you and i both know that biden can't complete a sentence
[3:42:28.520 --> 3:42:32.920]  i'm so basically you should be preparing not only for food storage
[3:42:32.920 --> 3:42:37.400]  but toiletries car parts all the things you will not be able to get
[3:42:37.400 --> 3:42:41.320]  this time next year start preparing right now
[3:42:41.320 --> 3:42:44.680]  and start kind of fighting this in that way making sure
[3:42:44.680 --> 3:42:47.640]  make make friends with a farmer and make friends with a mechanic
[3:42:47.640 --> 3:42:51.960]  i promise you it'll do you some good i'm k dally for the alex jones show i will
[3:42:51.960 --> 3:42:55.240]  be right back don't go anywhere
[3:42:56.360 --> 3:42:59.800]  there's an old better one saying that's thousands of years old
[3:42:59.800 --> 3:43:04.520]  and it goes like this trust in god but tie up your camel
[3:43:04.520 --> 3:43:08.760]  hunter s thompson put it this way pray to god but row away from the rocks
[3:43:08.760 --> 3:43:12.600]  if your boat is going towards the rocks pray to god that you don't get smashed
[3:43:12.600 --> 3:43:15.960]  on him and killed but also try to row away you can't just sit there like a
[3:43:15.960 --> 3:43:19.880]  jellyfish and it's the same thing with our immune system god helps those who

[3:44:13.400 --> 3:44:16.280]  from the little farmers that you know the media calls communist but really
[3:44:16.280 --> 3:44:19.560]  they're just a commune and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and
[3:44:19.560 --> 3:44:22.600]  we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over so i
[3:44:22.600 --> 3:44:25.480]  actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and i've been buying it for what 14

[3:47:10.680 --> 3:47:14.120]  welcome back to the alex jones show so glad you're tuned in today
[3:47:14.120 --> 3:47:17.000]  and hopefully we're all learning something together
[3:47:17.000 --> 3:47:21.080]  um i'm kate dally your guest host from kate dally radio dot com
[3:47:21.080 --> 3:47:26.360]  and um i do i do a daily show and i'm wrapped in all these headlines every
[3:47:26.360 --> 3:47:29.880]  day there was a headline curiously that just came out
[3:47:29.880 --> 3:47:32.920]  biden i'm not i can't make this up this was on
[3:47:32.920 --> 3:47:37.240]  jahu of all places so mainstream as they get
[3:47:37.240 --> 3:47:40.840]  biden to unveil plan for next pandemic
[3:47:40.840 --> 3:47:47.400]  while seeking 88 billion in funds next pandemic i'm sorry who's trying to
[3:47:47.400 --> 3:47:51.400]  come after us who who's trying to do that to us
[3:47:51.400 --> 3:47:58.200]  they never named the enemy ever isn't that interesting already
[3:47:58.200 --> 3:48:01.480]  planning putting it out in the pro yes we're going to have another one
[3:48:01.480 --> 3:48:05.240]  we didn't even have the first one remember no cemetery was ever built in
[3:48:05.240 --> 3:48:09.640]  the year 2020 or added on to oh i thought we had
[3:48:09.640 --> 3:48:12.920]  500 000 extra oh yeah not allowed to say that okay
[3:48:12.920 --> 3:48:19.160]  biden to unveil plan for next pandemic neat anyway so how do you fight it
[3:48:19.160 --> 3:48:22.920]  because we were just talking about what kind of fight so
[3:48:22.920 --> 3:48:26.200]  i think people think it's either got to be a violent fight in the streets or
[3:48:26.200 --> 3:48:29.720]  it's got to be or people are doing nothing but i don't agree with that
[3:48:29.720 --> 3:48:34.360]  i think there's a lot of people trying to really fight for the mind right now
[3:48:34.360 --> 3:48:37.720]  because i think that's what's under assault right now
[3:48:37.720 --> 3:48:41.320]  if people were exposing their government like they should be
[3:48:41.320 --> 3:48:45.400]  and realizing who the enemy is and honestly isn't that why talk shows
[3:48:45.400 --> 3:48:48.600]  exist we're trying to point out who the enemy is
[3:48:48.600 --> 3:48:52.600]  over and over and over again okay it's too many people
[3:48:52.600 --> 3:48:56.920]  love and believe their government even though in history that's never worked
[3:48:56.920 --> 3:49:00.760]  out well remember the hall demore created food
[3:49:00.760 --> 3:49:06.040]  crisis yeah starved to death so it's never worked out
[3:49:06.040 --> 3:49:09.400]  well but there's a kind of fight right now because we have the
[3:49:09.400 --> 3:49:12.440]  constitution already in place because we have this country
[3:49:12.440 --> 3:49:17.080]  that we need to nail that we're going to be responsible for doing and that is
[3:49:17.080 --> 3:49:21.080]  the war for the mind so there's so many lies
[3:49:21.080 --> 3:49:27.800]  that are being told right now and as the enemy isn't named right
[3:49:27.800 --> 3:49:32.680]  as but we know who the enemy is it's interesting how the messages are
[3:49:32.680 --> 3:49:36.840]  getting really screwed up let me give you an example
[3:49:36.840 --> 3:49:42.440]  my son one of my sons is an armed robber really really i mean he's just
[3:49:42.440 --> 3:49:47.000]  he's just going after banks left and right total armed robber
[3:49:47.000 --> 3:49:51.320]  okay and he loves it it's exhilarating and
[3:49:51.320 --> 3:49:55.080]  it also makes him kind of sad though yeah makes him kind of sad because he
[3:49:55.080 --> 3:49:57.480]  knows i mean i taught him right from wrong
[3:49:57.480 --> 3:50:02.280]  and i taught him the good book and he knows better right so i taught him
[3:50:02.280 --> 3:50:05.880]  right and wrong but now i'm kind of figuring that
[3:50:05.880 --> 3:50:09.560]  i need to be one of those parents that worries that all of a sudden if i don't
[3:50:09.560 --> 3:50:14.120]  go along with him being an armed robber that i need to
[3:50:14.120 --> 3:50:17.240]  i need to get on board i need to actually promote it
[3:50:17.240 --> 3:50:22.280]  i need to say yes i'm on board be an armed robber it's amazing
[3:50:22.280 --> 3:50:26.440]  now i know it's not amazing but i'm gonna say it's amazing
[3:50:26.440 --> 3:50:30.840]  i'm gonna tell you it's amazing gonna lie to my kid i'm gonna say yeah it'll
[3:50:30.840 --> 3:50:34.280]  bring you lots of happiness in your life it's awesome
[3:50:34.280 --> 3:50:37.160]  it's interesting because as a parent i used to be able to teach right from
[3:50:37.160 --> 3:50:40.360]  wrong and my kids never worried if i loved him or not you did it in a really
[3:50:40.360 --> 3:50:43.640]  loving kind way nobody ever said you had to be mean
[3:50:43.640 --> 3:50:47.880]  about it you just teach but for some reason
[3:50:47.880 --> 3:50:51.320]  we're to a place right now where everything goes
[3:50:51.320 --> 3:50:55.080]  chuck the ten commandments out the window let's just go to one commandment
[3:50:55.080 --> 3:50:59.800]  it's called don't hurt people's feelings and that will suffice
[3:50:59.800 --> 3:51:03.320]  and so i thought you know what i should join groups that
[3:51:03.320 --> 3:51:07.560]  love armed robbery and i should just be all on board and i mean
[3:51:07.560 --> 3:51:11.720]  all on board i should have banners that say i love armed robbery
[3:51:11.720 --> 3:51:15.240]  i love it and you can come to my house and tell me you're an armed robber i'm
[3:51:15.240 --> 3:51:20.520]  not going to do anything about it ever i'm even going to tell you it's great
[3:51:20.520 --> 3:51:24.680]  those ten commandments can be really really pesky they can get in the way
[3:51:24.680 --> 3:51:30.040]  so much easier if i go about the route of just saying everything goes
[3:51:30.040 --> 3:51:33.640]  remember when christ taught everything goes everything goes and just don't hurt
[3:51:33.640 --> 3:51:37.320]  feelings oh yeah that's right you didn't do that
[3:51:37.320 --> 3:51:43.000]  so here's the deal there are a lot of messages out there
[3:51:43.000 --> 3:51:48.760]  that are problematic because they twist what's going on
[3:51:48.760 --> 3:51:52.440]  they twist it and so when i'm looking at the world
[3:51:52.440 --> 3:51:56.200]  and i'm seeing this month of june and i'm seeing all the things that we're
[3:51:56.200 --> 3:52:00.920]  having to deal with right now i see a lot of really good christians and
[3:52:00.920 --> 3:52:04.600]  really good people all of a sudden jump on board
[3:52:04.600 --> 3:52:07.640]  the train that everybody seems to be getting on
[3:52:07.640 --> 3:52:11.400]  for a very small fraction of society that are armed robbers
[3:52:11.400 --> 3:52:17.400]  okay but they're all aboard the train and they're all aboard the you know what
[3:52:17.400 --> 3:52:22.440]  let's just go with anything goes and whatever choice you make child is
[3:52:22.440 --> 3:52:26.680]  completely incredible you're awesome right
[3:52:26.680 --> 3:52:32.200]  and the thing we need the most right now is parenting i realize that but i
[3:52:32.200 --> 3:52:35.960]  think let's just jump aboard right let's just make it happen
[3:52:35.960 --> 3:52:39.880]  let's just go all in for nothing ever being wrong
[3:52:39.880 --> 3:52:43.800]  everything being okay and when i say wrong i mean there are things i think
[3:52:43.800 --> 3:52:46.760]  that bring a lot of happiness and things that that might
[3:52:46.760 --> 3:52:51.240]  people might really struggle with when when they're engaged in certain things
[3:52:51.240 --> 3:52:58.520]  and i feel like as a society we're sort of caving when we need all hands on deck
[3:52:58.520 --> 3:53:05.880]  we need you more than ever before to be the person in that room that says
[3:53:05.880 --> 3:53:08.920]  there's things that are right there's things that are wrong and there's
[3:53:08.920 --> 3:53:12.360]  things that might not bring you the kind of happiness you're looking at
[3:53:12.360 --> 3:53:16.760]  but still love you but i'm still here to teach
[3:53:16.760 --> 3:53:20.440]  i'm still here to teach you and i think one of the things we're going to run
[3:53:20.440 --> 3:53:24.920]  up against is a lot more people kind of caving to
[3:53:24.920 --> 3:53:28.280]  this world and what's happening in it and when you wonder why america
[3:53:28.280 --> 3:53:34.040]  became the america we have right now why our morals and values just don't seem
[3:53:34.040 --> 3:53:39.000]  to matter anymore as a nation once we lose that once we lose
[3:53:39.000 --> 3:53:43.000]  that completely we don't be we're not america
[3:53:43.000 --> 3:53:47.080]  anymore we're not this country because the country isn't about a piece of land
[3:53:47.080 --> 3:53:50.440]  it's about what we stand for and who we stand up for
[3:53:50.440 --> 3:53:56.600]  isn't it that's what i was always taught so when the world is starting to cave
[3:53:56.600 --> 3:53:59.240]  and they're starting to go with these messages
[3:53:59.240 --> 3:54:05.560]  what i find the most interesting is is you have a situation where it starts out
[3:54:05.560 --> 3:54:11.400]  as one thing and then becomes another a totally different thing
[3:54:11.400 --> 3:54:15.000]  and they used it as a trojan horse to try to get in
[3:54:15.000 --> 3:54:21.480]  and then present all kinds of things um there was a uh an event in my state and
[3:54:21.480 --> 3:54:26.680]  this event uh was done on on the notion for gay pride
[3:54:26.680 --> 3:54:31.720]  the most interesting part about this though was that it wasn't that it was
[3:54:31.720 --> 3:54:35.720]  people putting satan blood on people and
[3:54:35.720 --> 3:54:41.240]  you know the exposed breasts and the and the twerking in front of kids and the
[3:54:41.240 --> 3:54:45.400]  total debauchery and i thought when did it go into that
[3:54:45.400 --> 3:54:49.720]  because there's so many people um that aren't okay with that
[3:54:49.720 --> 3:54:53.640]  they're not okay with that at all but when did it segue into that and when
[3:54:53.640 --> 3:54:58.920]  did that become okay i don't know i know as a nation
[3:54:58.920 --> 3:55:03.240]  that when we seek to do good and when we seek to understand
[3:55:03.240 --> 3:55:08.600]  who to honor and who not to honor that it's pretty clear what happens to us as
[3:55:08.600 --> 3:55:12.840]  a people am i right so we need to be really
[3:55:12.840 --> 3:55:17.400]  careful about the messages i see parents that cease to be parents
[3:55:17.400 --> 3:55:22.600]  i see i i see parents that are so afraid they're so afraid to stand up
[3:55:22.600 --> 3:55:26.200]  that they become the friend mom i call them froms
[3:55:26.200 --> 3:55:30.280]  they're like a friend mom they're they they're no longer a mom
[3:55:30.280 --> 3:55:34.440]  you go to your parents because you expect them to not lose their values and
[3:55:34.440 --> 3:55:38.040]  not lose their morals and to and to maybe be that
[3:55:38.040 --> 3:55:41.560]  guide you know that guiding force in your life
[3:55:41.560 --> 3:55:45.720]  the ones that'll tell you sometimes when hey that might not be the best path
[3:55:45.720 --> 3:55:49.640]  for you but it seems like nowadays we're kind of going
[3:55:49.640 --> 3:55:53.400]  all in on anything goes because if you choose it honey
[3:55:53.400 --> 3:55:57.720]  you are remarkable no matter what you choose it's amazing
[3:55:57.720 --> 3:56:01.160]  haven't you heard that over and over again my child's amazing what did he do
[3:56:01.160 --> 3:56:05.960]  nothing he's just amazing if that parenting in america
[3:56:05.960 --> 3:56:09.960]  something's wrong and i'm seeing more of it this summer for some reason
[3:56:09.960 --> 3:56:13.240]  i've been a lot of places this summer and let me just tell you i'm noticing this
[3:56:13.240 --> 3:56:19.240]  more and more and more parents see seem to be parents parents stop
[3:56:19.240 --> 3:56:22.360]  holding the line they stop teaching and they say
[3:56:22.360 --> 3:56:29.400]  anything goes knowing it's not true because as you can see in society
[3:56:29.400 --> 3:56:33.640]  right you understand when things aren't right with somebody
[3:56:33.640 --> 3:56:38.120]  the depression the sadness and instead of looking at the depression and the
[3:56:38.120 --> 3:56:41.400]  sadness that things might be causing somebody
[3:56:41.400 --> 3:56:44.680]  what do we do we just say the answer is in oh they just
[3:56:44.680 --> 3:56:49.000]  they just need more love instead of being honest with them
[3:56:49.000 --> 3:56:55.320]  i vote we go back to honesty i vote that we go back to some morals and values as
[3:56:55.320 --> 3:56:58.840]  a country and i vote that parents start to be parents
[3:56:58.840 --> 3:57:01.640]  again and start to be honest with their kids
[3:57:01.640 --> 3:57:06.280]  and toe that line we need all hands on deck we can't lose
[3:57:06.280 --> 3:57:11.640]  who we are to a bunch of lies we're told enough lies right
[3:57:11.640 --> 3:57:14.840]  and so let's stand up for something important
[3:57:14.840 --> 3:57:21.960]  let's you know stand up with conviction it's not a bad thing
[3:57:21.960 --> 3:57:27.160]  and you can do it with love but stand up i'm kate deli your guest host for the
