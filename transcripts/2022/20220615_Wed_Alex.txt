[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.899]   Ladies and gentlemen, this Monday, history was made right here in this
[00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:22.838]   studio when Mike Adams had a microscope and was investigating the vaccine
[00:00:22.838 --> 00:00:27.760]   blood clots that are getting pulled out of victims bodies.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.760]  victims' bodies.
[00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:34.989]  And he sat right here at this desk with a microscope, live on TV doing it.
[00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.429]   Greg Reese has been a follow-up report with some of the more shocking images from that day.
[00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:54.350]   The evidence of vaccine death and injuries is overwhelming to anyone capable of seeing past
[00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.269]  the mainstream media's hypnotic lies.
[00:00:58.438 --> 00:01:02.621]  The numbers tell us that the vaccines have already caused a 20% increase in deaths.
[00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:07.224]  Now we have a run rate of about 20% excess mortality.
[00:01:07.504 --> 00:01:12.727]  That's confirmed by the CDC numbers, the funeral home numbers, and the insurance company numbers.
[00:01:12.807 --> 00:01:17.050]  And then somebody did an independent study I saw recently suggesting 20% is the number.
[00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.171]  So we're running at 20% excess deaths.
[00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.813]  And a 10% increase in disabilities.
[00:01:22.173 --> 00:01:23.253]  This is a stunning number.
[00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:29.637]  You're telling me that things have been flat for 5 years at 29 million and all of a sudden out of the data they get 3 million people are disabled?
[00:01:30.117 --> 00:01:30.678]  Out of nowhere?
[00:01:31.418 --> 00:01:35.243]  And now we are beginning to understand that this is just the beginning.
[00:01:35.664 --> 00:01:37.946]  Things are going to get much, much worse.
[00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:49.120]  Many of us have already seen the mysterious objects found in the vials of COVID vaccines by two separate independent groups using electron microscopy.
[00:01:49.921 --> 00:02:01.127]  We are also familiar with the rising number of strokes, heart attacks, and other side effects experienced worldwide after the biggest experimental vaccination in history.
[00:02:02.028 --> 00:02:05.930]  And now we are getting a first glimpse of what is causing all this.
[00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.135]  Something in the COVID vaccines seems to be growing within the recipient's vascular system.
[00:02:12.756 --> 00:02:19.122]  Anomalous objects are being discovered in the dead bodies of the vaccinated by embalmers and coroners.
[00:02:19.862 --> 00:02:24.166]  Horrific things being grown inside the veins and arteries.
[00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:29.851]  These are not blood clots, and they appear to be some sort of organic material.
[00:02:30.672 --> 00:02:37.299]  With small crystals and extremely thin wires made up of what looks like reptilian scales.
[00:02:39.181 --> 00:02:47.289]  This internal blockage growing within the vaccinated would certainly explain all of the deadly side effects we are seeing today.
[00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.636]  What the mainstream media is currently spinning as sudden adult death syndrome.
[00:02:55.433 --> 00:03:01.277]  We do not know what these things are, but they are being found by embalmers and coroners everywhere.
[00:03:01.997 --> 00:03:05.979]  Except, pretty much all of them are too afraid to speak out.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.600]  Or they don't care.
[00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:12.163]  Only one has shown the courage to speak out so far.
[00:03:12.723 --> 00:03:14.364]  And this is the real tragedy.
[00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:18.367]  For those who remain silent, things will not get better.
[00:03:19.148 --> 00:03:26.053]  The FDA is poised to authorize these deadly vaccines to children as young as six months old.
[00:03:26.734 --> 00:03:28.555]  And humanity does nothing.
[00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:34.260]  Today, we want to provide an update on a topic that I know many parents and grandparents are focused on.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.444]  The potential for the first COVID-19 vaccines for kids under five.
[00:03:40.465 --> 00:03:43.087]  We have waited a long time for this moment.
[00:03:43.527 --> 00:03:44.968]  Well, guys, here's some good news.
[00:03:45.008 --> 00:03:51.870]  The Biden administration has finally announced a vaccine rollout plan for children under five, and they've ordered 10 million doses.
[00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:53.371]  That's great.
[00:03:57.192 --> 00:03:59.693]  Right now, kids are like, oh, my gosh, we can finally meet up for drinks.
[00:04:01.454 --> 00:04:04.735]  Yep, as we speak, everyone in the lollipop industry is like, we're buying a yacht.
[00:04:04.815 --> 00:04:05.635]  Here we go.
[00:04:05.675 --> 00:04:06.536]  You get a lollipop.
[00:04:06.556 --> 00:04:06.996]  You get one.
[00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:11.998]  It's very exciting to hear a four-year-old scream, Facebook told me Bill Gates controls the vaccines.
[00:04:15.485 --> 00:04:21.449]  Why should we deserve anything other than pain and suffering if we do nothing to protect our own children?
[00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:29.915]  Once those afraid of speaking out begin seeing their coroner tables filled with dead children, it will be too late.
[00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:31.817]  But it's not too late now.
[00:04:32.477 --> 00:04:42.544]  If you aren't a bomber, a coroner, or a funeral director, and you are seeing these things, there is still time to save the lives of our innocent children.
[00:04:43.425 --> 00:04:49.148]  You can start now by contacting Dr. Jane Ruby at protonmail.com.
[00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:52.910]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:55.192 --> 00:04:56.532]  Pretty amazing to think, isn't it?
[00:04:58.033 --> 00:04:59.014]  That this is all happening.
[00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:00.975]  You're experiencing it, you're witnessing all of it.
[00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:04.577]  That Greg Reese report can be found at band.video.
[00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live here on this Wednesday, June 15th.
[00:05:12.463 --> 00:05:15.945]  Edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:19.087]  Owen Schroer still sitting in for Alex.
[00:05:19.627 --> 00:05:20.748]  Just a couple more days.
[00:05:20.908 --> 00:05:21.708]  Just a couple more days.
[00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:26.111]  The boss will be back and we may be hearing from him throughout the transmission today.
[00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:28.873]  I'm actually going to be with you till 6 p.m.
[00:05:29.193 --> 00:05:29.693]  tonight.
[00:05:29.933 --> 00:05:37.178]  So double duty for me and I've got six plus hours of news coverage here and video clips to get to.
[00:05:37.978 --> 00:05:44.100]   So there will be no shortage of of information distribution today.
[00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:47.482]  Let me just tell you what's coming up.
[00:05:48.502 --> 00:06:00.786]  We do have some latest breaking, if you will, January 6th panel news, where they're now delaying the hearings because nobody's watching.
[00:06:01.126 --> 00:06:03.907]  It's actually hurting the Democrats, so they decided to cancel it.
[00:06:04.147 --> 00:06:05.188]  Just shows it's all political.
[00:06:06.004 --> 00:06:07.685]  They did it because they thought it would help them politically.
[00:06:07.705 --> 00:06:09.206]  It ended up hurting them politically.
[00:06:09.466 --> 00:06:10.626]  They're no longer doing it anymore.
[00:06:11.187 --> 00:06:13.328]  So it just shows it's not about justice or January 6th.
[00:06:13.348 --> 00:06:15.769]  It's all about Democrat Party agenda politics.
[00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:25.674]  But Ted Cruz grilled the FBI representative about reps to which the rep... Look, I'm not trying to be funny.
[00:06:25.754 --> 00:06:27.055]  I don't know if it's a man or a woman, okay?
[00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:28.095]  It's one of those deals.
[00:06:28.375 --> 00:06:29.316]  It's a he-she, okay?
[00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:31.077]  They got the he-she's running the FBI now.
[00:06:31.517 --> 00:06:32.377]  So I'm sure that'll be good.
[00:06:33.098 --> 00:06:35.719]  And the he-she couldn't answer any of the questions, of course.
[00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:50.179]  And, uh, they're saying, oh, well, we're not going to have any criminal referrals of Trump or any of the defendants because, well, that has all their brainwashed minions upset.
[00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.119]  They're saying, what are you talking about?
[00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.282]  I thought this whole thing was about getting rid of Trump and arresting all of his people.
[00:06:55.643 --> 00:06:56.023]  Oh, no.
[00:06:56.063 --> 00:07:04.750]  See, the Democrats don't actually want to do that because they know if that standard is held to them, they're all going to be arrested.
[00:07:05.595 --> 00:07:14.978]  You know, Maxine Waters calling for violence, Chuck Schumer calling for violence, assassination attempts by Democrats happening every year, multiple times a year.
[00:07:16.258 --> 00:07:24.781]  So they don't want that standard to be set and held to them because they know, well, ultimately they'd look worse than Trump if that were the case.
[00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:31.563]  Yeah, they try to bury Democrat terrorism, but we all know it goes on and it continues this week.
[00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:41.364]  As they're really, really just chomping at the bit to start riding and raging and rampaging if they can't murder their babies, which you'll still be able to do!
[00:07:41.404 --> 00:07:42.445]  I don't know why they're so panicked.
[00:07:42.465 --> 00:07:43.385]  You'll still be able to do that.
[00:07:43.445 --> 00:07:44.546]  It's just going to be up to the states.
[00:07:45.867 --> 00:07:52.570]  The very notion, the very thought, the very breath that they might not be able to murder their babies just drives them up a wall.
[00:07:53.131 --> 00:07:54.932]  But yes, there are counter-protesters.
[00:07:55.012 --> 00:07:56.753]  I salute this young girl who went out there.
[00:07:58.166 --> 00:08:03.949]  You know, the left interrupts protests all the time, and they do their counter-protesting, and they get loud and obnoxious.
[00:08:03.989 --> 00:08:04.710]  We all witness it.
[00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:11.634]  But oh, if conservatives try to do that, they get bullied and pushed around, and... Well, I've dealt with this too many times to speak of.
[00:08:12.134 --> 00:08:16.097]  But good for that lady for counter-protesting them, calling abortion murder.
[00:08:16.517 --> 00:08:17.437]  They don't like that!
[00:08:18.598 --> 00:08:20.039]  They don't like that at all.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.762]  And you know, the whole psychology here is...
[00:08:26.837 --> 00:08:33.039]  They don't like the truth about themselves is the best way I could put it.
[00:08:33.099 --> 00:08:36.780]  Dan Bongino has been saying they don't like a mirror held to their face.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.101]  It's one way of putting it, but the point is they don't like the truth about themselves.
[00:08:43.282 --> 00:08:44.822]  They know abortion is murder.
[00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:49.664]  They still want to be able to do it and not feel any guilt or have any guilt cast upon them.
[00:08:51.616 --> 00:08:54.319]  But like, think about the Libs of TikTok situation.
[00:08:54.839 --> 00:08:57.322]  Libs of TikTok does no original content.
[00:08:58.503 --> 00:09:01.947]  No original content from the lady that runs Libs of TikTok.
[00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:13.307]   All she does is take liberals from mostly TikTok, it's like probably 95% TikTok videos, Liberals that post them.
[00:09:13.907 --> 00:09:15.628]  Liberals publish this stuff.
[00:09:15.809 --> 00:09:24.234]  They publicly put it on the internet, and Libs of TikTok just takes it and reposts it on the Twitter account that she runs, Libs of TikTok.
[00:09:24.735 --> 00:09:27.737]  And Twitter wants it banned, and the left wants it banned.
[00:09:29.338 --> 00:09:29.658]  Why?
[00:09:30.178 --> 00:09:32.400]  Because they don't like the truth about themselves.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.662]  There is no original content that comes from Libs of TikTok.
[00:09:35.802 --> 00:09:37.023]  It comes from Libs.
[00:09:38.168 --> 00:09:39.269]  That they put on the internet.
[00:09:39.289 --> 00:09:42.352]  So why wouldn't all the original creators of the content be getting banned?
[00:09:42.652 --> 00:09:43.953]  Why is it only libs of TikTok?
[00:09:44.674 --> 00:09:48.137]  Because they don't like the truth about themselves.
[00:09:49.318 --> 00:09:59.587]  That's why you go up to an abortion rally with a sign that says abortion is murder, you start seeing them flip out like raging banshees because they don't like the truth about themselves.
[00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:00.568]  But let me just move on.
[00:10:01.528 --> 00:10:12.743]   We've got some more other news here regarding The midterm elections, some primaries, some election results from last night, it's really all good news.
[00:10:14.183 --> 00:10:28.787]  I don't know how much we can really trust elections right now, for obvious reasons, but if you follow the primaries, or you've been following the primaries, there's a reason why even the Democrat media is saying, uh, we're screwed.
[00:10:29.908 --> 00:10:34.709]  Because Republicans are outdrawing Democrats right now almost double.
[00:10:36.128 --> 00:10:41.753]  And they're flipping seats that have been held by Democrats for decades like something that happened last night.
[00:10:41.793 --> 00:10:44.895]  So we'll cover that coming up as well.
[00:10:46.216 --> 00:10:48.618]  And interesting, you know, I hadn't covered this yet.
[00:10:48.638 --> 00:10:50.920]  I don't know if anybody at Infowars had really covered it too much.
[00:10:52.355 --> 00:10:54.976]  The Patriot Front group getting arrested in Idaho.
[00:10:55.476 --> 00:10:59.657]  I've kept my hands off that because, well, for obvious reasons.
[00:11:00.397 --> 00:11:05.279]  And I think we've kind of got our first little riff that gives us an idea of what's really going on here.
[00:11:05.339 --> 00:11:06.659]  And it's what we all expected.
[00:11:07.499 --> 00:11:17.943]  But... Yeah, let's just say... Let's just say we've got our first, I think, window into what's going on with the Patriot Front group.
[00:11:18.563 --> 00:11:18.783]  As if...
[00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:20.878]  It's not our first window.
[00:11:20.898 --> 00:11:28.161]  We've had other windows like the Lincoln Project involvement, and them of course showing up at these other events.
[00:11:29.241 --> 00:11:31.102]  Clearly well organized.
[00:11:32.282 --> 00:11:37.804]  And so, could there be federal embeds and law enforcement embeds?
[00:11:37.904 --> 00:11:41.565]  Well, we've got a little interesting news update on that today as well.
[00:11:43.124 --> 00:11:43.704]  Let's see here.
[00:11:43.764 --> 00:11:45.425]  Biden continues to falter.
[00:11:45.685 --> 00:11:49.066]  The ratings continue to plummet for Biden.
[00:11:49.086 --> 00:11:50.307]  The approval ratings, that is.
[00:11:51.107 --> 00:11:56.389]  He's getting more obstinate in his speeches, starting to really sound like Hitler.
[00:11:56.409 --> 00:12:01.050]  Like, you know, Hitler would scream into the mic, be very passionate.
[00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.891]  Now Biden is screaming into the mic, telling you everything's Putin's fault.
[00:12:04.772 --> 00:12:07.452]  So we've got those clips and some of the latest news as well.
[00:12:08.413 --> 00:12:09.133]  Boy, oh boy.
[00:12:08.992 --> 00:12:19.591]   You know, it's just one of those deals where, you know, the old saying, I hate to say I
[00:12:19.591 --> 00:12:20.712]  told you so.
[00:12:20.712 --> 00:12:26.472]   It's just, we might as well put it into the wall here somewhere.
[00:12:26.472 --> 00:12:36.472]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:12:27.858 --> 00:12:33.581]  We might as well scrape it into the wall here somewhere, because it's really just getting ridiculous, the hate to say I told you so stuff.
[00:12:34.762 --> 00:12:39.024]  And so now Biden is tapping into the oil reserves again.
[00:12:40.244 --> 00:12:40.544]  Again.
[00:12:42.285 --> 00:12:52.112]   And once he had the first release, I said on the war room, He's going to release more than half of our strategic oil reserves.
[00:12:52.412 --> 00:12:53.672]  Biden has now done that.
[00:12:54.812 --> 00:12:56.573]  Oh, and it's all in the name of lowering prices.
[00:12:56.793 --> 00:12:57.593]  Except here's the thing.
[00:12:57.993 --> 00:13:00.994]  The reserves aren't coming to the U.S., they're going to Europe, folks.
[00:13:02.134 --> 00:13:02.894]  So he's done it again.
[00:13:03.654 --> 00:13:04.555]  We'll have that coming up.
[00:13:05.835 --> 00:13:07.996]  Oh, you got a wide-open southern border, by the way.
[00:13:08.836 --> 00:13:10.536]  You got a wide-open southern border.
[00:13:10.836 --> 00:13:14.097]  Three million illegal immigrants pouring over it every year.
[00:13:15.457 --> 00:13:16.277]  And now they're voting!
[00:13:16.798 --> 00:13:17.778]  And now they're voting.
[00:13:19.827 --> 00:13:29.792]  When you step back and you look at what's going on with the illegal immigration and the open border, I mean, folks, there is a criminal organization enterprise happening here.
[00:13:29.872 --> 00:13:36.936]  I mean, it is so ridiculous that no other explanation should even be heard.
[00:13:37.736 --> 00:13:40.998]  It is a criminal operation, what's going on at the southern border.
[00:13:41.398 --> 00:13:43.719]  And I think it's just such a large criminal operation.
[00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:45.380]  There's so many different odds and ends to it.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.041]  So many different people profiting.
[00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:49.402]  But we'll have that coming up.
[00:13:51.678 --> 00:13:55.903]  Oh my, a stack of vaccine news and health news today.
[00:13:56.604 --> 00:13:57.084]  Yikes.
[00:13:58.065 --> 00:13:58.386]  Yikes.
[00:14:00.368 --> 00:14:06.315]  I mean, they publish stories and we've got the proof with headlines.
[00:14:07.799 --> 00:14:12.202]  Moderna COVID vaccine may pose higher heart inflammation risk, U.S.
[00:14:12.242 --> 00:14:12.743]  CDC.
[00:14:12.783 --> 00:14:15.665]  And then they have to change the headline, U.S.
[00:14:15.845 --> 00:14:19.288]  FDA advisors overwhelmingly back Moderna COVID vaccine.
[00:14:19.308 --> 00:14:23.971]  So the original headline is, this vaccine's killing people, and then they edit it and they say, oh no, look, the U.S.
[00:14:23.991 --> 00:14:25.092]  government says that it's good.
[00:14:27.053 --> 00:14:30.436]  And of course, we've got more of the groomers coming after your children.
[00:14:31.497 --> 00:14:34.239]  Liberal groomers, they are real sick freaks, aren't they?
[00:14:34.946 --> 00:14:58.345]  You may recall, you may not, that in 2018, an election year, midterm elections, Democrats were running against Republicans, or exactly, Donald Trump, on high gas prices.
[00:14:58.385 --> 00:14:59.006]  Do you remember that?
[00:15:00.486 --> 00:15:06.308]  Do you remember Democrats running against high gas prices, blaming Donald Trump for that, talking about it was a national emergency?
[00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:10.350]  How much was gas at the time, you ask?
[00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.071]  $3.89 national average.
[00:15:12.531 --> 00:15:23.635]  Here was Chuck Schumer attacking President Trump in 2018 as Democrats' strategy in the midterms was to blame Trump for high gas prices, saying they're out of control.
[00:15:23.835 --> 00:15:25.496]  Here's a little flashback for you in clip three.
[00:15:26.391 --> 00:15:32.355]  President Trump can take action today to help alleviate the pain at the pump for Americans.
[00:15:33.116 --> 00:15:40.281]  It's time for this president to stand up to OPEC on behalf of the forgotten man and woman he promised to remember.
[00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:41.602]  Wow!
[00:15:42.802 --> 00:15:44.143]  Well, now do Biden, Chuck.
[00:15:45.084 --> 00:15:46.085]  Now do Biden!
[00:15:47.406 --> 00:15:52.449]  Now that gas is at a national average of over $5 a gallon, now do Biden, Chuck!
[00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:58.453]  So gas at $3.89 a gallon national average, the Democrats used that to run against Trump in the midterms.
[00:15:59.174 --> 00:16:04.057]  Chuck Schumer makes speeches like that, demanding Trump do something about people's pain at the pump.
[00:16:04.858 --> 00:16:07.900]  Now it's almost $2 more than when Chuck Schumer was crying about it.
[00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:11.042]  And he has nothing to say.
[00:16:12.723 --> 00:16:15.457]   And by the way, now, U.S.
[00:16:15.477 --> 00:16:24.942]  to sell up to 45 million barrels of oil from its strategic oil reserve and part of historic release.
[00:16:25.383 --> 00:16:27.944]  This is now the third release from Joe Biden.
[00:16:28.224 --> 00:16:34.087]  This is now the third release from Joe Biden of our oil reserve.
[00:16:34.247 --> 00:16:35.168]  Never needed to happen.
[00:16:35.228 --> 00:16:36.989]  Not one of them even needed to happen.
[00:16:37.697 --> 00:16:42.518]  The oil reserve is now depleted more than 50% since Biden has taken office.
[00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:45.639]  Whenever the next president replaces Biden, there's going to be nothing.
[00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:47.160]  There are going to be no oil reserves.
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:57.663]  As the world is going into chaos, and we're closer to nuclear war than ever before maybe, and we're going to have no strategic oil reserves because Biden is giving it all away.
[00:16:57.963 --> 00:17:00.264]  And by the way, it's not going to Americans.
[00:17:01.344 --> 00:17:03.565]  It's not staying right here in the homeland.
[00:17:04.045 --> 00:17:04.885]  It's going to Europe!
[00:17:06.013 --> 00:17:09.555]  It's going to Europe because here's what's happening.
[00:17:11.136 --> 00:17:15.499]  European leaders are calling up Biden and saying, hey, you piece of crap.
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.961]  What in the F are you doing?
[00:17:20.162 --> 00:17:27.507]  Your war with Russia is now costing us and you giving Russia control of the pipelines going into Europe is costing us even more.
[00:17:29.178 --> 00:17:35.682]  And then you have the Biden administration saying, oh, you think it's hard on you, you should see gas in Europe.
[00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:38.103]  Well, yeah, because Biden did that to Europe.
[00:17:39.464 --> 00:17:47.048]  And so European leaders call up Biden and they say, hey, you piece of crap, keeping it censored, you're crushing our economy.
[00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:50.030]  You're causing our people to pay more at the pump.
[00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.431]  You think you can do something about that, you jerk?
[00:17:53.652 --> 00:17:54.953]  You imbecile?
[00:17:56.294 --> 00:17:57.114]  And so what does Biden do?
[00:17:57.134 --> 00:18:02.235]   He says, well, okay, And he gives them our strategic oil reserves.
[00:18:03.055 --> 00:18:04.776]  That's what's going on, folks.
[00:18:07.158 --> 00:18:13.842]  Biden is so inept that he's even causing Europeans' gas prices to double.
[00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:22.308]  Everyone knows it's Biden, so European leaders call up Biden and they say, you're so pathetic, our gas prices have doubled.
[00:18:22.548 --> 00:18:24.971]  And Biden says, well, hey, keep that under wraps.
[00:18:25.231 --> 00:18:26.212]  Don't say anything.
[00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:27.453]  Don't blame it on me.
[00:18:28.013 --> 00:18:30.856]  I'll send you our strategic oil reserves to shut up.
[00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:39.985]  So Biden is basically paying for the silence of European leaders with oil because he's cost their prices to double as well.
[00:18:42.591 --> 00:18:50.613]  So when you see it like this, gas prices hit new all-time high as EU considers blocking Russian oil, Biden keeps restrictions.
[00:18:51.713 --> 00:18:53.654]  They can't block the Russian oil, folks.
[00:18:54.054 --> 00:18:54.834]  They need it.
[00:18:56.114 --> 00:18:58.295]  Biden gave Russia control of the pipeline.
[00:18:59.415 --> 00:19:03.956]  So to pay for European leaders' silence, Biden is paying them off in oil.
[00:19:04.936 --> 00:19:08.237]  I mean, unbelievable that we're dealing with this.
[00:19:08.497 --> 00:19:10.598]  Unbelievable we're dealing with this corruption.
[00:19:11.533 --> 00:19:29.043]  So not only is he illegitimately, unnecessarily tapping into our strategic oil reserves, he's giving them to Europe to pay for their silence because they're so obsessed with trying to label this the Putin price hike, which everyone knows it's not.
[00:19:29.303 --> 00:19:31.344]  Everyone knows it's the Biden price hike worldwide.
[00:19:31.905 --> 00:19:34.666]  So he's paying for European silence with our oil.
[00:19:35.427 --> 00:19:36.367]  Unbelievable stuff.
[00:19:36.888 --> 00:19:42.947]   And then, Biden tells oil refiners, produce more gas and have less profits.
[00:19:43.587 --> 00:19:44.527]  He thinks you're stupid.
[00:19:44.707 --> 00:19:45.988]  Or he knows his voters are stupid.
[00:19:46.688 --> 00:19:53.611]  Folks, gas prices change depending on regulations, availability, all this stuff.
[00:19:53.671 --> 00:19:57.750]  I'm not going to go into a long diatribe here.
[00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:01.671]   But to sit here and act like Biden, "Hey, oil companies, lower your prices."
[00:20:01.671 --> 00:20:03.750]  What are you talking about?
[00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:09.350]   There's an entire international oil community of purchasing oil and price per barrel and
[00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.671]  all this stuff.
[00:20:10.671 --> 00:20:15.990]   By the time it's your hand touching the pump going into your car, there's like thousands
[00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:23.911]   of regulations and it's actually the owner of the gas station that's deciding that price
[00:20:23.911 --> 00:20:28.110]   based off all the other stuff that's happened, a hundred thousand things before it even gets
[00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:28.510]  to them.
[00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:38.510]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:37.607]  So it's just ludicrous to say, oh, produce more gas, as he's making it illegal to produce more gas, and he says, oh, fewer profits.
[00:20:39.429 --> 00:20:39.970]  Well, that's just...
[00:20:41.004 --> 00:20:44.426]  That's just anti-capitalism, but okay, fine.
[00:20:44.726 --> 00:20:45.947]  You're against corporate greed.
[00:20:46.288 --> 00:20:47.448]  But so what are they supposed to do?
[00:20:47.829 --> 00:20:52.051]  John Kerry, as gas prices skyrocket, we absolutely don't need to drill for more oil.
[00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:53.893]  So Biden says, produce more oil!
[00:20:54.733 --> 00:20:56.955]  The gas companies say, well, how do you want me to do that?
[00:20:57.075 --> 00:20:58.075]  I guess we'll have to drill.
[00:20:58.616 --> 00:21:00.937]  And then the Biden administration says, no, don't drill!
[00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:03.239]  What are they supposed to do?
[00:21:03.319 --> 00:21:08.002]  Like, wave a magic wand, abracadabra, and just produce gas?
[00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:11.244]  It's completely insane.
[00:21:12.325 --> 00:21:13.506]  But here's a compilation.
[00:21:14.568 --> 00:21:20.013]  Everything Biden or everything Trump warned you about Biden comes true here in clip 11.
[00:21:20.213 --> 00:21:28.622]  Before I took office, there was a lot of folks out there, a lot of folks out there making some pretty bold predictions about how things would turn out.
[00:21:29.639 --> 00:21:31.360]  You might remember some of the predictions.
[00:21:31.981 --> 00:21:37.245]  They're coming for your guns, they're coming for your jobs, and they're coming for your freedom.
[00:21:37.765 --> 00:21:41.768]  They hate American energy and Joe Biden will shut it all down.
[00:21:41.808 --> 00:21:42.449]  He's going to.
[00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:45.511]  That if I became president.
[00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:49.895]  Biden's elected, he will wipe out your energy industry.
[00:21:50.155 --> 00:21:55.719]  Another prediction that is my favorite one, I must add, is that if I got elected.
[00:21:55.839 --> 00:21:58.041]  Gas prices going $5, $6, $7 for a gallon.
[00:22:01.716 --> 00:22:09.163]  In flood your communities with criminal aliens, drugs and crime, while they live behind beautiful gated compounds.
[00:22:10.453 --> 00:22:12.174]  They try to take away your gun.
[00:22:12.294 --> 00:22:13.215]  Second Amendment.
[00:22:13.255 --> 00:22:14.356]  They want to take it away.
[00:22:15.297 --> 00:22:18.559]  While they enjoy private security that's fully armed.
[00:22:19.159 --> 00:22:20.420]  I never understood that one.
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:28.006]  To spend trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders.
[00:22:28.066 --> 00:22:32.769]  For all those predictions of doom and gloom six months in, here's where I stand.
[00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:35.351]  Do you want to use the word recession or depression?
[00:22:35.551 --> 00:22:39.154]  Think of the single mom struggling to put food on the table each month.
[00:22:39.815 --> 00:22:41.116]  You know, it's sad.
[00:22:41.437 --> 00:22:46.441]  So, if your primary concern right now is inflation... We could stop it in 30 minutes.
[00:22:46.902 --> 00:22:49.264]  When I took office... He finally went outside.
[00:22:49.284 --> 00:22:51.086]  He went to get an ice cream.
[00:22:51.546 --> 00:22:52.827]  Look, the bottom line is this.
[00:22:53.248 --> 00:22:54.989]  I say you're not doing a very good job.
[00:22:55.009 --> 00:22:58.192]  Because he can't take any questions now from the press.
[00:23:01.335 --> 00:23:05.098]  So there you go, and that was on the campaign trail in 2020.
[00:23:05.418 --> 00:23:08.661]  Donald Trump, everything he warned us about Biden came true.
[00:23:08.821 --> 00:23:10.482]  Holy smokes.
[00:23:11.243 --> 00:23:16.607]  First, I'm doing everything in my power to blunt Putin's gas price hike.
[00:23:17.327 --> 00:23:26.394]  Just since he invaded Ukraine, it's gone up $1.74 a gallon because of nothing else but that.
[00:23:28.456 --> 00:23:30.538]  Is that Joe Biden or Adolphus?
[00:23:31.749 --> 00:23:32.069]  Hitler.
[00:23:32.189 --> 00:23:32.730]  I can't tell.
[00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:33.350]  Same vibes.
[00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:34.571]  Same vibes for sure.
[00:23:35.952 --> 00:23:36.072]  Oh!
[00:23:36.092 --> 00:23:39.655]  Oh, it's nothing else but that!
[00:23:39.735 --> 00:23:42.256]  He points at you and screams into the microphone.
[00:23:42.296 --> 00:23:43.157]  It's all Putin!
[00:23:43.858 --> 00:23:47.400]  As he pays for Europe's silence with our strategic oil reserves.
[00:23:49.041 --> 00:23:50.943]  And it's doubled since he's been into office.
[00:23:51.203 --> 00:23:53.665]  Yeah, it's gone up 174 since Putin went to Ukraine.
[00:23:53.705 --> 00:23:55.426]  It went up 174 before that, too.
[00:23:57.007 --> 00:23:57.867]  Just amazing stuff.
[00:23:57.887 --> 00:23:59.268]  And they expect you to believe this.
[00:24:00.296 --> 00:24:02.337]  Is what's even more incredible about it.
[00:24:02.557 --> 00:24:05.199]  They expect you to believe it.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:15.164]  But the Biden economy continues to collapse and destroy us.
[00:24:15.324 --> 00:24:20.007]  Another US food processing plant erupts into flames.
[00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:25.773]  And so what is this, like 50 since Biden has taken office?
[00:24:26.413 --> 00:24:32.837]  50 food processing plants or processing centers or even fertilizer processing plants and centers?
[00:24:32.877 --> 00:24:36.099]  You've had about 50 of them burned down since Biden got into office?
[00:24:36.439 --> 00:24:40.482]  Nothing from the DHS, nothing from the FBI, nothing from the White House.
[00:24:40.862 --> 00:24:42.543]  We're just supposed to act like that's normal!
[00:24:43.704 --> 00:24:49.327]  We're just supposed to act like that's normal for all the food processing plants to be burned to the ground.
[00:24:49.367 --> 00:24:50.568]  And it's always a fire, too.
[00:24:51.519 --> 00:24:53.460]  Really, just amazing stuff.
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:25:02.323]  So if they're not being burned to the ground, they're literally being shut down by Democrats, like Smithfield Pork Processing Plant in California.
[00:25:02.343 --> 00:25:07.225]  They came out and said, yeah, we're shutting down, we can't afford to exist in California, Democrats have crushed our business.
[00:25:07.725 --> 00:25:07.886]  Ha!
[00:25:08.086 --> 00:25:10.186]  Just like Biden promised he would.
[00:25:11.287 --> 00:25:18.290]  And you know, you've probably heard of this story, but there's a new riff now, and Senator Joni Ernst has the story.
[00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:22.672]  But we've heard about how we're paying for the wall that doesn't exist, right?
[00:25:23.872 --> 00:25:31.935]  We signed contracts with these companies to build the wall, and Biden has basically said, nope, don't build the wall.
[00:25:32.276 --> 00:25:37.958]  It doesn't matter, they're already under contract, we've already bought the materials, we're still paying for them.
[00:25:39.239 --> 00:25:43.060]  Biden's charging taxpayers to babysit unused border wall materials.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.902]  Folks, they're literally sitting down there, just sitting there, instead of building the wall.
[00:25:49.542 --> 00:25:50.323]  Unbelievable stuff.
[00:25:51.724 --> 00:25:58.688]  We paid for the wall, we paid for the construction, we paid for the material, and Biden said, nope, we don't want it.
[00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:06.674]  And now we have record levels of illegal immigration happening.
[00:26:09.164 --> 00:26:16.829]  Illegal aliens set to receive driver's licenses in Massachusetts after state legislature overrides governor's veto.
[00:26:16.849 --> 00:26:22.112]  17 states now allow illegal immigrants to get government-issued photo ID.
[00:26:22.572 --> 00:26:23.493]  And they vote, too!
[00:26:24.013 --> 00:26:25.054]  And they vote.
[00:26:25.914 --> 00:26:26.635]  Isn't that nice?
[00:26:28.936 --> 00:26:30.737]  What's the point of even having a border we don't?
[00:26:32.458 --> 00:26:35.200]  What's the point of even having any laws when we don't have a border?
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.942]  What's the point of paying taxes or having a country when we don't have a border?
[00:26:38.976 --> 00:26:42.738]  See, these are the basic common sense stuff they don't want you to ask and realize.
[00:26:44.138 --> 00:26:51.902]  Now, folks, I don't want to belabor this point because it's more of a confusion and frustration than anything else.
[00:26:55.024 --> 00:27:07.910]  We know what's going on at the southern border as far as it's wide open, three million illegals crossing a year, the drug trafficking, the human trafficking, the facilitation of all this now by the Border Patrol thanks to the Democrats.
[00:27:09.518 --> 00:27:12.420]  The money that gets spent, the hotels, I mean, all of it.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:25.446]  But, there's something else going on here that I really can't quite put the finger on, or the finger of my mind on, even.
[00:27:27.027 --> 00:27:30.528]  Let me just read the rest of these headlines and try to flesh this out.
[00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:37.232]  But I'm telling you, there is something going on at the southern border that is beyond comprehension, even.
[00:27:38.098 --> 00:27:43.663]  Survey, 49% of Hondurans and 39% in El Salvador consider migrating.
[00:27:44.604 --> 00:27:51.791]  Folks, again, there's something unreal happening right now with this southern border being wide open.
[00:27:53.953 --> 00:27:57.997]  This is so shocking, it's unbelievable.
[00:27:59.943 --> 00:28:07.685]  More than a quarter of the population of Central America has migrated to the United States in the last two decades.
[00:28:08.725 --> 00:28:09.785]  Did you hear what I just said?
[00:28:10.805 --> 00:28:20.708]  One in four, one in four in Central America has migrated to the United States in the last two decades.
[00:28:21.268 --> 00:28:22.308]  One in four!
[00:28:24.244 --> 00:28:28.506]  Call it an invasion, call it population replacement, call it whatever you want.
[00:28:28.907 --> 00:28:31.408]  I mean, folks, that is drastic.
[00:28:32.188 --> 00:28:34.390]  That is drastic.
[00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:41.493]  That is an entire population exodus movement.
[00:28:42.534 --> 00:28:46.196]  I mean, again, I don't even know how to properly... It's an exodus.
[00:28:47.797 --> 00:28:48.877]  It's mass migration.
[00:28:48.938 --> 00:28:49.598]  It's an invasion.
[00:28:51.314 --> 00:28:54.996]  And so you compound that with the fact that you're paying for all of it.
[00:28:56.357 --> 00:28:59.159]  Someone's paying and facilitating their journey to get here.
[00:29:00.059 --> 00:29:02.861]  And then, of course, once they get here, then they get all the freebies, all the handouts.
[00:29:02.901 --> 00:29:04.262]  That's part of the reason why they come.
[00:29:05.082 --> 00:29:06.243]  Because they get everything for free.
[00:29:06.783 --> 00:29:07.684]  It's a big boondoggle.
[00:29:09.431 --> 00:29:10.692]  And the same thing is going on in Europe.
[00:29:11.312 --> 00:29:12.954]  And guys, now you can roll the B-roll of clip 6.
[00:29:13.214 --> 00:29:14.835]  That's why I had it, because of the story here.
[00:29:15.536 --> 00:29:23.081]  Europe's migration problems set to worsen as survey shows more than half of young Africans plan to immigrate.
[00:29:23.742 --> 00:29:25.323]  Now, what happened to France?
[00:29:25.643 --> 00:29:29.646]  Here you have Lyon in the 1900s.
[00:29:29.806 --> 00:29:32.328]  The year 1900, apparently, is where this footage is from, recolorized.
[00:29:33.128 --> 00:29:34.990]  And then here you have it in 2021.
[00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:36.451]  It's a hellhole.
[00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:37.632]  It's an asshole.
[00:29:39.551 --> 00:29:44.054]  Poverty, crime, trash, desolation everywhere.
[00:29:45.055 --> 00:29:48.737]  When a hundred years ago, nothing like that existed in France.
[00:29:48.877 --> 00:29:49.718]  What happened?
[00:29:50.198 --> 00:29:54.961]  The mass migration, the mass exodus, the mass population replacement.
[00:29:55.761 --> 00:29:56.422]  Globalism.
[00:29:57.403 --> 00:29:58.223]  That's what's happened.
[00:30:00.104 --> 00:30:05.508]  But when you think about the numbers, oh, half of young Africans plan to immigrate to Europe.
[00:30:06.485 --> 00:30:08.887]  Half of Central Americans plan to immigrate to America?
[00:30:08.967 --> 00:30:13.069]  I mean, folks, there is something bigger on top of all of this.
[00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:21.715]  I think it goes beyond even the realm of politics, but politicians are obviously profiting off of it, or being bought off.
[00:30:22.634 --> 00:30:24.796]  How can this possibly be going on?
[00:30:24.837 --> 00:30:25.938]  Let me finish headlines.
[00:30:26.498 --> 00:30:33.186]  Biden regime to punish border patrol agents in horseback incident involving Haitian illegals two months after they were cleared of the charges.
[00:30:33.566 --> 00:30:34.447]  Yeah, they lied about that.
[00:30:34.487 --> 00:30:35.408]  They said they used whips.
[00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:36.610]  There was an investigation.
[00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:37.290]  There were no whips.
[00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.091]  The whole thing was a lie.
[00:30:38.532 --> 00:30:41.014]  And so now the Biden regime is punishing them anyway.
[00:30:41.034 --> 00:30:42.376]  Because it's the Biden regime.
[00:30:42.416 --> 00:30:43.017]  It's Democrats.
[00:30:43.057 --> 00:30:43.878]  They're worse than Nazis.
[00:30:44.338 --> 00:30:46.840]  Border agents rescue 18 illegals from drowning.
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:47.540]  Can you imagine?
[00:30:48.041 --> 00:30:51.063]  Border agents die trying to rescue people from drowning, by the way.
[00:30:51.343 --> 00:30:51.984]  Can you imagine?
[00:30:52.004 --> 00:30:52.904]  You're a Border Patrol agent.
[00:30:52.944 --> 00:31:06.935]  You get spat on, you get kicked, you get treated like garbage, treated like dirt by Democrats, by the Biden administration, and you still have the courage and the fortitude to go rescue people drowning, even though you're never going to be thanked for it.
[00:31:07.255 --> 00:31:08.496]  You're going to be punished for it, probably.
[00:31:08.516 --> 00:31:22.325]   I mean, you don't think people Heartless people with half a mind would say, why should I go risk my life for these illegal immigrants coming here that I'm paying for already anyway, when I'm the one being persecuted by my government?
[00:31:23.485 --> 00:31:24.906]  And they still do it, folks.
[00:31:25.146 --> 00:31:25.806]  They still do it.
[00:31:27.327 --> 00:31:37.819]   But, okay, aside from the dirty deeds and the corruption and this just sickness of the Democrat Party, again, What is going on at the southern border?
[00:31:37.879 --> 00:31:40.501]  Like, what is going on?
[00:31:41.081 --> 00:31:42.522]  It makes no sense.
[00:31:43.042 --> 00:31:43.403]  None.
[00:31:44.443 --> 00:31:46.264]  How do we have a wide open southern border?
[00:31:46.525 --> 00:31:48.906]  How do we have 3 million illegal immigrants every year?
[00:31:49.186 --> 00:31:51.467]  How come we're paying hundreds of billions of dollars to do it?
[00:31:51.768 --> 00:31:58.712]  Why do we also send out hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign aid to these countries so that they don't have to send all their people here?
[00:31:59.132 --> 00:32:00.573]  What is going on?
[00:32:01.952 --> 00:32:06.918]  Is anybody ever going to look into this and figure out what the hell is going on with the southern border?
[00:32:06.958 --> 00:32:08.400]  This is beyond politics, folks.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.982]  This is a massive criminal enterprise.
[00:32:10.522 --> 00:32:13.085]  Well, yesterday was Donald Trump's birthday.
[00:32:14.227 --> 00:32:23.850]  And so James Kluge went out to ask people, I believe this is in California, how they would like to wish President Trump a happy birthday.
[00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:32.513]  And it's pretty obvious here the dichotomy between a leftist and a non-leftist, or rather a leftist and a sane person.
[00:32:33.014 --> 00:32:35.895]  And it just, it all flows here in this one video.
[00:32:36.395 --> 00:32:39.816]  And in a short two-minute video, I think so much can be unpacked.
[00:32:40.276 --> 00:32:44.919]  But here is James Kluge asking Californians what they would say to Trump on his birthday.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.721]  Donald Trump's birthday is on the 14th.
[00:32:46.741 --> 00:32:48.162]  Do you have a birthday message for him?
[00:32:48.182 --> 00:32:49.543]  Yeah, tell him to go get fucked.
[00:32:49.563 --> 00:32:49.843]  Really?
[00:32:50.003 --> 00:32:50.664]  Oh, very nice guy.
[00:32:50.704 --> 00:32:50.924]  Right on.
[00:32:50.944 --> 00:32:53.346]  Do you have a birthday message for Donald Trump?
[00:32:54.507 --> 00:32:55.247]  Middle finger, nice.
[00:32:56.548 --> 00:32:56.968]  What do we got?
[00:32:56.988 --> 00:32:57.349]  What do we got?
[00:32:57.369 --> 00:32:59.150]  Yeah, we love you and we miss you, motherfucker.
[00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.551]  Wait, can I curse?
[00:33:00.571 --> 00:33:01.412]  Say whatever you want.
[00:33:01.632 --> 00:33:03.153]  Yeah, we love you and we miss you, motherfucker.
[00:33:03.874 --> 00:33:09.198]  Oh my gosh, happy birthday, keep doing good things, and keep making American great.
[00:33:09.238 --> 00:33:09.758]  We love you.
[00:33:09.778 --> 00:33:13.401]  I don't care what y'all gotta say, Donald Trump is the best president.
[00:33:13.501 --> 00:33:17.064]  You have more money in your pocket, you have more money in your bank account.
[00:33:17.084 --> 00:33:20.826]  They fucking suck, excuse my language, but they're very awful.
[00:33:20.645 --> 00:33:25.524]   Socks use my language, but they're very awful. You're not happy with how things are going right now. Hell no
[00:33:25.524 --> 00:33:29.996]   Ever since he got out of it, we all went yes, bro Of course.
[00:33:30.356 --> 00:33:31.136]  What's the birthday wish?
[00:33:31.156 --> 00:33:33.737]  Happy birthday to you.
[00:33:34.317 --> 00:33:38.059]  Donald Trump, happy birthday to you.
[00:33:38.079 --> 00:33:38.579]  We love you.
[00:33:38.639 --> 00:33:39.659]  Really hitting the right notes here.
[00:33:40.219 --> 00:33:41.440]  I'm gonna vote for Trump in 2024.
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:42.440]  Is that true?
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.160]  Yeah.
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.481]  Birthday message for Donald Trump.
[00:33:44.621 --> 00:33:44.981]  What is it?
[00:33:45.581 --> 00:33:46.401]  Fuck off and die.
[00:33:46.621 --> 00:33:46.922]  Right on.
[00:33:47.082 --> 00:33:47.862]  That's very loving.
[00:33:47.902 --> 00:33:48.502]  Fuck off and die.
[00:33:48.722 --> 00:33:49.222]  Alright.
[00:33:49.242 --> 00:33:50.483]  I own the lower gas prices.
[00:33:52.321 --> 00:33:53.241]  Trump, lower gas prices.
[00:33:53.281 --> 00:33:54.062]  What are you doing?
[00:33:54.142 --> 00:33:54.742]  Happy birthday.
[00:33:54.902 --> 00:33:55.582]  That's pretty gnarly.
[00:33:55.602 --> 00:33:57.203]  We're going to double down on that?
[00:33:57.223 --> 00:33:57.943]  He's a bad man.
[00:33:58.003 --> 00:33:59.143]  He's a bad man.
[00:33:59.203 --> 00:34:01.404]  He's caused untold harm to our country.
[00:34:01.464 --> 00:34:03.985]  He needs to go away and go to prison where he belongs.
[00:34:04.085 --> 00:34:05.926]  I can't wait to see him in an orange jumpsuit.
[00:34:06.066 --> 00:34:07.266]  What does he need to go to prison for?
[00:34:07.726 --> 00:34:09.387]  For all the crimes that he's committed.
[00:34:09.587 --> 00:34:09.987]  Like what?
[00:34:11.238 --> 00:34:13.939]  Like, trying to overthrow our country?
[00:34:14.019 --> 00:34:14.639]  There it is.
[00:34:14.799 --> 00:34:15.540]  Hello!
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.100]  Where have you been, dude?
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.041]  Was that a riot?
[00:34:18.081 --> 00:34:18.821]  Where have you been?
[00:34:18.841 --> 00:34:19.741]  Did he tell him to go do that?
[00:34:19.761 --> 00:34:21.742]  Haven't you been watching the establishment propaganda?
[00:34:21.762 --> 00:34:23.323]  Yes, he did tell him to go do that!
[00:34:23.343 --> 00:34:23.943]  Hahaha, fool!
[00:34:24.043 --> 00:34:25.284]  Did you watch the rally?
[00:34:25.384 --> 00:34:27.504]  I did, I can literally memorize cults.
[00:34:27.524 --> 00:34:28.425]  You're hopeless!
[00:34:28.445 --> 00:34:30.386]  You're not in my cult, I don't want to talk to you.
[00:34:30.406 --> 00:34:32.246]  Where did he tell him to go do that, exactly?
[00:34:32.306 --> 00:34:32.967]  Like, what part of it?
[00:34:33.187 --> 00:34:33.567]  The speech?
[00:34:33.847 --> 00:34:34.347]  Where did he?
[00:34:34.667 --> 00:34:35.067]  What did he say?
[00:34:35.087 --> 00:34:35.688]  Like, what did he say?
[00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:40.070]  If you don't fight, we're not gonna have a country anymore.
[00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:41.551]  You mean the quote, fight like hell?
[00:34:41.631 --> 00:34:47.174]  Oh yeah, Bernie Sanders said that, a lot of other Democrats said that, and then when Trump said that- Schooled in limetime.
[00:34:47.435 --> 00:34:48.795]  Dude, you're a Trump fan?
[00:34:48.955 --> 00:34:49.856]  Oh yes, I am.
[00:34:50.036 --> 00:34:52.938]  Oh, the white liberal hates the free black man.
[00:34:53.038 --> 00:34:56.300]  I'm from Compton, California too, and I'm a Trump fan.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.521]  Got the coin too in the back of my pocket.
[00:34:58.541 --> 00:34:59.562]  Proud ****, baby.
[00:35:02.083 --> 00:35:02.664]  Incredible.
[00:35:04.631 --> 00:35:08.052]  Oh, white liberals hate it when they see a black person that they don't control.
[00:35:08.132 --> 00:35:09.773]  They just hate it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:12.034]  Wow, there you go.
[00:35:12.334 --> 00:35:13.594]  Thought it was worth a share today.
[00:35:14.855 --> 00:35:21.937]  Ladies and gentlemen, your immune system is the bedrock of your health.
[00:35:23.598 --> 00:35:33.181]  And so, the reason why the globalists are targeting your immune system is because they know that and they want you sick and unhealthy so that you die at a younger age.
[00:35:34.424 --> 00:35:40.134]  Or that you can get on the government dole with government taxpayer funded health care and all this other stuff.
[00:35:41.718 --> 00:35:47.943]  So that's why they forced the mRNA injection into you to kill your immune system, which we now know it does.
[00:35:48.163 --> 00:35:49.504]  Some people call it vaccine AIDS.
[00:35:49.564 --> 00:35:53.707]  But aside from that, you need to have a strong immune system.
[00:35:54.207 --> 00:35:57.449]  I don't care whether it's winter or summer or spring or fall.
[00:35:57.970 --> 00:35:59.771]  And so we want you to have a strong immune system.

[00:36:39.676 --> 00:36:40.276]  Folks, look.
[00:36:41.357 --> 00:36:43.258]  Everybody knows about the multivitamins.
[00:36:43.618 --> 00:36:46.559]  They've become very popular in recent decades.
[00:36:46.699 --> 00:36:50.300]  We just went out and found the best multivitamin ingredients that we could find.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.740]  We made our own multivitamin.
[00:36:52.701 --> 00:36:54.821]  The Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine.
[00:36:54.861 --> 00:37:00.363]  Most people are deficient in iodine, so we went out, found the best source, put it into a liquid tincture.
[00:37:00.483 --> 00:37:01.704]  It's Survival Shield X2.
[00:37:02.664 --> 00:37:03.824]  Vitamin D3 with gummies.
[00:37:04.765 --> 00:37:10.694]   You know, Most people are deficient on vitamin D year-round, but especially in the winter.
[00:37:10.734 --> 00:37:15.117]  But year-round, still, most people deficient in vitamin D. These gummies are great.
[00:37:15.157 --> 00:37:15.778]  They taste great.
[00:37:15.798 --> 00:37:16.758]  They have calcium as well.
[00:37:16.979 --> 00:37:18.199]  Great for children, by the way.
[00:37:18.299 --> 00:37:19.280]  I highly recommend.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.443]  Just put two out on the counter every morning for your kids and they'll eat them up.
[00:37:23.563 --> 00:37:24.023]  They'll love them.
[00:37:24.684 --> 00:37:27.386]  You'll be sure they're never vitamin D deficient.
[00:37:27.446 --> 00:37:29.247]  And then the immune support formula.
[00:37:29.367 --> 00:37:48.111]   We just went out and said, look, Let's find the most organic ingredients that just are occurring in nature to help build your immune system, like elderberry, and astragalus root, and lomanthian root, and angelica root, and so much more.
[00:37:48.251 --> 00:37:54.454]   And we said, let's just take those all-natural ingredients and put it into a liquid tincture
[00:37:54.454 --> 00:37:57.454]   so that people can build their immune systems organically and naturally.
[00:37:57.454 --> 00:37:58.814]  It's immune support.
[00:37:58.814 --> 00:38:05.254]   So that liquid tincture is available at Infowarsstore.com, but it's also in the Ultimate Immune Support Pack,
[00:38:05.254 --> 00:38:06.854]  60% off, folks.
[00:38:06.854 --> 00:38:14.233]   Cannot say enough about a strong immune system, especially now that the globalists and the mad scientists
[00:38:14.233 --> 00:38:18.354]   and the Bill Gates of the world are releasing genetically modified mosquitoes
[00:38:18.354 --> 00:38:24.094]   and man-made viruses and all kinds of crap being sprayed down upon us.
[00:38:24.328 --> 00:38:29.871]  Folks, you got to understand this is the environment built to poison us.
[00:38:30.876 --> 00:38:34.221]  So you need to start counteracting that, taking measures to counteract that.
[00:38:34.261 --> 00:38:37.306]  That's why we sell the supplements at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:38:37.326 --> 00:38:39.810]  And that's why I'm telling you about the Ultimate Immune Support Pack.
[00:38:40.591 --> 00:38:43.475]  60% off right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:38:44.884 --> 00:38:49.326]  So key, so key, so key for your immune system.
[00:38:49.826 --> 00:38:55.948]  And of course, to your support at InfoWordStore.com that keeps everything we do here on the air.
[00:38:56.449 --> 00:39:09.554]  Not just the news that we cover, but all of our great guests as well, like one I have coming up in the next hour, Rob Dew and others, to discuss what happened at a recent Drag Queen Storytime event where some men went in and busted it up.
[00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:12.418]  And force the drag queen to leave the event.
[00:39:13.039 --> 00:39:15.362]  We'll have that story coming up later.
[00:39:16.003 --> 00:39:21.552]  In the meantime, though, what happens when liberal logic is put to the test?
[00:39:22.854 --> 00:39:23.996]  It falls apart, doesn't it?
[00:39:24.096 --> 00:39:25.098]  Because what do we say here?
[00:39:26.368 --> 00:39:31.490]  If logic cannot be applied universally, it's not logic, it's propaganda.
[00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.871]  If logic cannot be applied universally, it's not logic, it's propaganda.
[00:39:36.271 --> 00:39:46.434]  Here is a perfect example of that in clip 9, when the abortion activists who chant My Body My Choice are asked about the vaccine, here's how it went in clip 9.
[00:39:47.096 --> 00:39:48.657]  What's important is bodily autonomy.
[00:39:48.817 --> 00:39:50.137]  The same right men have always had.
[00:39:50.317 --> 00:39:51.518]  We just want equal rights.
[00:39:51.958 --> 00:39:54.559]  The right to govern our own bodies, just like men have always had.
[00:39:54.699 --> 00:39:55.539]  She likes men, doesn't she?
[00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:57.820]  Do you support the right for people to not get the COVID vaccine?
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:39:59.600]  It's irrelevant.
[00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:02.702]  My body, my choice.
[00:40:02.722 --> 00:40:03.582]  You're right.
[00:40:04.302 --> 00:40:04.982]  It's not irrelevant.
[00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:05.763]  Yeah, but one saves lives.
[00:40:05.863 --> 00:40:06.443]  You're right.
[00:40:06.563 --> 00:40:07.403]  It's not irrelevant.
[00:40:07.743 --> 00:40:09.764]  One of them is going to be in a- Pause it right there.
[00:40:10.244 --> 00:40:16.525]   I don't know if there has ever been a more delusional Response or moment?
[00:40:16.685 --> 00:40:17.846]  And it happens all the time.
[00:40:18.746 --> 00:40:20.126]  Because you hear it all the time from the left.
[00:40:20.206 --> 00:40:22.127]  It says, my body, my choice, you bring up the vaccines.
[00:40:22.747 --> 00:40:24.987]  Well, one of them is saving lives.
[00:40:25.427 --> 00:40:27.228]  Well, you're threatening me with a virus.
[00:40:27.868 --> 00:40:30.269]  You're literally killing your child.
[00:40:31.469 --> 00:40:33.989]  You're literally ending a human heartbeat.
[00:40:34.009 --> 00:40:35.410]  You're literally ending a life.
[00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:44.372]  I mean, has liberal hypocrisy, has liberalism as a mental disorder ever been more encapsulated into a tiny little moment?
[00:40:45.353 --> 00:40:50.334]  Then my body, my choice, and oh, vaccines save lives as they literally end a life with their abortion?
[00:40:51.415 --> 00:41:00.997]  I don't know if the hypocrisy and the mental illness of liberalism has ever been so encapsulated into a tiny, ingestible pill as it is right there for your mind.
[00:41:01.597 --> 00:41:04.418]  But, okay guys, rewind it and then just play that again.
[00:41:06.238 --> 00:41:10.039]  Right, a state of emergency, which we all know laws change during a state of emergency.
[00:41:10.059 --> 00:41:13.280]  Do you agree with the statement or the principle of my body, my choice?
[00:41:13.806 --> 00:41:14.587]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:41:14.787 --> 00:41:16.368]  Bodily autonomy is a human right.
[00:41:16.448 --> 00:41:17.709]  Healthcare is a human right.
[00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:23.353]  Access to healthcare should not be something that is dictated by the Supreme Court.
[00:41:23.173 --> 00:41:26.532]   During the pandemic, did you support people's right to not get the COVID vaccine?
[00:41:26.532 --> 00:41:34.213]  It's a difficult conversation.
[00:41:34.421 --> 00:41:37.323]  Do you support bodily autonomy in other situations?
[00:41:37.483 --> 00:41:38.664]  For example, the COVID vaccine.
[00:41:38.704 --> 00:41:39.564]  Pause it, pause it guys.
[00:41:39.804 --> 00:41:41.225]  Pause it and rewind it 15 seconds.
[00:41:41.265 --> 00:41:43.227]  Because, again, understand.
[00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:47.277]  It's not logic unless it can be applied universally.
[00:41:47.737 --> 00:41:48.718]  Then it's propaganda.
[00:41:48.958 --> 00:41:50.179]  So she just had that moment.
[00:41:50.219 --> 00:41:53.561]  She realized, wait a second, my logic cannot be applied universally.
[00:41:54.062 --> 00:41:55.783]  So how do I respond to this question?
[00:41:56.123 --> 00:41:57.944]  You've been propagandized, woman.
[00:41:58.384 --> 00:41:59.425]  That's what we're trying to tell you.
[00:41:59.465 --> 00:42:02.227]  All right, finish the clip.
[00:42:03.048 --> 00:42:06.328]   During the pandemic, did you support people's right to not get the COVID vaccine?
[00:42:06.328 --> 00:42:14.008]  It's a difficult conversation.
[00:42:14.246 --> 00:42:17.149]  Do you support bodily autonomy in other situations?
[00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:21.554]  For example, the COVID vaccine mandates.
[00:42:21.574 --> 00:42:23.997]  We've been mandated to get vaccines for years and years and years.
[00:42:24.017 --> 00:42:27.060]  So you do support, in that situation, people not having control of their bodies?
[00:42:27.841 --> 00:42:31.746]  That's not having not control of your bodies.
[00:42:31.846 --> 00:42:32.507]  I don't understand.
[00:42:34.198 --> 00:42:38.441]  You think it is important for people to have medical and health control of their own body?
[00:42:38.462 --> 00:42:41.004]  Uh, yeah, it's good for them.
[00:42:41.184 --> 00:42:42.765]  Liberals, you've been propagandized.
[00:42:42.825 --> 00:42:43.826]  Just admit it.
[00:42:44.546 --> 00:42:49.551]  Ladies and gentlemen, what we did here in this studio on Monday is so important that it needs to be seen.
[00:42:49.571 --> 00:42:50.892]  We're going to play this report again.
[00:42:51.512 --> 00:43:00.828]   It's Greg Reese filing a report on Mike Adams sitting right here at this desk with The quote-unquote blood clots, really not sure what it is actually.
[00:43:00.848 --> 00:43:03.130]  It's never been seen before in medical history.
[00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:06.573]  What's being removed from vaccinated individuals' bodies?
[00:43:06.813 --> 00:43:08.255]  You need to take this report and share it.
[00:43:08.275 --> 00:43:10.877]  You need to take Mike Adams' live report and share it from Monday.
[00:43:10.957 --> 00:43:15.117]  But here's Gregory's boil down of what we witnessed.
[00:43:15.117 --> 00:43:21.117]  [MUSIC]
[00:43:21.117 --> 00:43:26.517]   The evidence of vaccine death and injuries is overwhelming to anyone
[00:43:26.517 --> 00:43:31.476]  capable of seeing past the mainstream media's hypnotic lies.
[00:43:31.699 --> 00:43:35.883]  The numbers tell us that the vaccines have already caused a 20% increase in deaths.
[00:43:37.364 --> 00:43:40.466]  Now we have a run rate of about 20% excess mortality.
[00:43:40.766 --> 00:43:45.990]  That's confirmed by the CDC numbers, the funeral home numbers, and the insurance company numbers.
[00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:50.313]  And then somebody did an independent study I saw recently suggesting 20% is the number.
[00:43:50.633 --> 00:43:52.435]  So we're running at 20% excess deaths.
[00:43:52.675 --> 00:43:55.077]  And a 10% increase in disabilities.
[00:43:55.437 --> 00:43:56.518]  This is a stunning number.
[00:43:57.098 --> 00:44:02.902]  You're telling me that things have been flat for 5 years at 29 million and all of a sudden out of the data they get 3 million people are disabled?
[00:44:03.382 --> 00:44:03.943]  Out of nowhere?
[00:44:04.683 --> 00:44:08.486]  And now we are beginning to understand that this is just the beginning.
[00:44:08.927 --> 00:44:11.209]  Things are going to get much, much worse.
[00:44:11.929 --> 00:44:22.378]  Many of us have already seen the mysterious objects found in the vials of COVID vaccines by two separate independent groups using electron microscopy.
[00:44:23.178 --> 00:44:34.392]  We are also familiar with the rising number of strokes, heart attacks, and other side effects experienced worldwide after the biggest experimental vaccination in history.
[00:44:35.293 --> 00:44:39.197]  And now we are getting a first glimpse of what is causing all this.
[00:44:39.998 --> 00:44:45.401]  Something in the COVID vaccines seems to be growing within the recipient's vascular system.
[00:44:46.022 --> 00:44:52.385]  Anomalous objects are being discovered in the dead bodies of the vaccinated by embalmers and coroners.
[00:44:53.126 --> 00:44:57.408]  Horrific things being grown inside the veins and arteries.
[00:44:58.229 --> 00:45:03.112]  These are not blood clots, and they appear to be some sort of organic material.
[00:45:03.932 --> 00:45:10.555]  With small crystals and extremely thin wires made up of what looks like reptilian scales.
[00:45:12.416 --> 00:45:20.559]  This internal blockage growing within the vaccinated would certainly explain all of the deadly side effects we are seeing today.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:26.882]  What the mainstream media is currently spinning as sudden adult death syndrome.
[00:45:28.692 --> 00:45:34.536]  We do not know what these things are, but they are being found by embalmers and coroners everywhere.
[00:45:35.256 --> 00:45:39.238]  Except, pretty much all of them are too afraid to speak out.
[00:45:39.979 --> 00:45:40.859]  Or they don't care.
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:45.422]  Only one has shown the courage to speak out so far.
[00:45:45.982 --> 00:45:47.603]  And this is the real tragedy.
[00:45:48.644 --> 00:45:51.625]  For those who remain silent, things will not get better.
[00:45:52.405 --> 00:45:59.306]  The FDA is poised to authorize these deadly vaccines to children as young as six months old.
[00:45:59.986 --> 00:46:01.807]  And humanity does nothing.
[00:46:02.327 --> 00:46:07.508]  Today, we want to provide an update on a topic that I know many parents and grandparents are focused on.
[00:46:08.128 --> 00:46:12.689]  The potential for the first COVID-19 vaccines for kids under five.
[00:46:13.709 --> 00:46:16.330]  We have waited a long time for this moment.
[00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:18.211]  Well, guys, here's some good news.
[00:46:18.271 --> 00:46:25.134]  The Biden administration has finally announced a vaccine rollout plan for children under five, and they've ordered 10 million doses.
[00:46:26.195 --> 00:46:26.635]  That's great.
[00:46:30.457 --> 00:46:32.958]  Right now, kids are like, oh, my gosh, we can finally meet up for drinks.
[00:46:34.719 --> 00:46:38.000]  Yep, as we speak, everyone in the lollipop industry is like, we're buying a yacht!
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:38.580]  Here we go!
[00:46:38.721 --> 00:46:40.261]  If you get a lollipop, you get one.
[00:46:41.222 --> 00:46:45.264]  It's very exciting to hear a four-year-old scream, Facebook told me Bill Gates controls the vaccines.
[00:46:48.738 --> 00:46:54.719]  Why should we deserve anything other than pain and suffering if we do nothing to protect our own children?
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:03.181]  Once those afraid of speaking out begin seeing their coroner tables filled with dead children, it will be too late.
[00:47:03.681 --> 00:47:05.062]  But it's not too late now.
[00:47:05.722 --> 00:47:15.804]  If you aren't a bomber, a coroner, or a funeral director, and you are seeing these things, there is still time to save the lives of our innocent children.
[00:47:16.684 --> 00:47:22.411]  You can start now by contacting Dr. Jane Ruby at protonmail.com.
[00:47:23.533 --> 00:47:30.533]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:47:30.533 --> 00:47:45.732]   The Heights Public Library today debuting a new children's story hour
[00:47:45.732 --> 00:47:48.212]  called "Drag Queen Story Time."
[00:47:48.319 --> 00:47:49.399]  My name is Blackberry.
[00:47:49.519 --> 00:47:50.999]  I'm a bearded drag queen.
[00:47:51.199 --> 00:47:53.720]  That means I'm a lady with lots of facial hair.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:57.421]  I'm actually going to be one of the drag queens reading for Drag Queen Storytime.
[00:47:57.501 --> 00:47:58.761]  Drag Queen Storytime.
[00:47:58.881 --> 00:48:05.703]  And we have to warn you, ladies and gentlemen, if you've got young or impressionable children in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[00:48:07.614 --> 00:48:12.677]  And we witnessed parents taking their children, as young as two, inside to take part.
[00:48:12.797 --> 00:48:14.638]  Talking, singing, and reading.
[00:48:15.218 --> 00:48:16.659]  We can both be grooms.
[00:48:16.779 --> 00:48:20.461]  To an audience of preschoolers, toddlers, and their caregivers.
[00:48:20.601 --> 00:48:24.463]  The hips on the drag queen go swish, swish, swish.
[00:48:24.563 --> 00:48:25.204]  Turn around.
[00:48:26.865 --> 00:48:27.585]  And shake your butt!
[00:48:27.605 --> 00:48:28.846]  Shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em!
[00:48:28.946 --> 00:48:32.107]  It was a first for this branch of the public library, too.
[00:48:32.328 --> 00:48:32.948]  Are you nervous?
[00:48:33.228 --> 00:48:33.388]  Yes.
[00:48:33.408 --> 00:48:34.749]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[00:48:35.811 --> 00:48:35.991]  No.
[00:48:36.631 --> 00:48:42.054]  And for the children and the people that support it are gonna realize that this is gonna be the grooming of the next generation.
[00:48:42.314 --> 00:48:47.637]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable to seeing it.
[00:48:47.857 --> 00:48:50.978]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone.
[00:48:51.458 --> 00:48:56.161]  No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[00:48:56.381 --> 00:48:58.582]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up?
[00:48:58.762 --> 00:49:00.042]  You could be a drag queen superhero!
[00:49:00.102 --> 00:49:00.603]  Are you nervous?
[00:49:04.911 --> 00:49:06.031]  They were all accepting.
[00:49:06.071 --> 00:49:10.573]  They all were happy about it and excited and giving me hugs and everything.
[00:49:10.853 --> 00:49:12.634]  The woman gets up on her table, spreads her legs.
[00:49:12.694 --> 00:49:13.374]  It's a man.
[00:49:14.214 --> 00:49:15.895]  This is adult entertainment.
[00:49:16.135 --> 00:49:18.735]  Most people seem to walk away having a good time.
[00:49:18.815 --> 00:49:19.856]  A stardom young, right?
[00:49:19.956 --> 00:49:21.556]  A stardom young, right?
[00:49:21.636 --> 00:49:23.417]  Anyone can do drag.
[00:49:24.682 --> 00:49:25.742]  Everyone can do drag.
[00:49:25.822 --> 00:49:28.183]  Everyone can do drag.
[00:49:28.323 --> 00:49:30.884]  I'm all about education.
[00:49:30.904 --> 00:49:33.865]  I actually do story time with drag queens in Chicago.
[00:49:33.885 --> 00:49:34.065]  Right?
[00:49:37.006 --> 00:49:37.086]  Yes.
[00:49:37.126 --> 00:49:38.727]  Family programming.
[00:49:39.367 --> 00:49:40.627]  Love it.
[00:49:40.647 --> 00:49:40.707]  Yes.
[00:49:40.787 --> 00:49:49.590]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a Houston public library as part of its drag queen story hour.
[00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:58.272]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina, is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[00:49:58.612 --> 00:50:01.933]  In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an 8-year-old boy.
[00:50:02.153 --> 00:50:04.974]  This is Tatiana Malanina, my sister from Queens of the Week.
[00:50:05.174 --> 00:50:06.674]  What has this world come to?
[00:50:06.974 --> 00:50:09.395]  It's come to a world where drag kids actually exist.
[00:50:09.495 --> 00:50:10.775]  And people do ketamine on a couch.
[00:50:13.154 --> 00:50:18.558]  Desmond is the world's youngest club kid, and we challenge you, as the people out there, to find a younger club kid.
[00:50:18.578 --> 00:50:19.159]  Will they find one?
[00:50:19.959 --> 00:50:20.160]  No.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:27.946]  Please welcome Desmond Naples, aka Desmond Is Amazing!
[00:50:27.966 --> 00:50:28.927]  Have you been to a nightclub?
[00:50:29.327 --> 00:50:29.487]  No.
[00:50:29.807 --> 00:50:30.027]  No?
[00:50:29.948 --> 00:50:30.948]  Oh, okay.
[00:50:30.948 --> 00:50:36.948]  [Music]
[00:50:36.948 --> 00:50:40.948]   Drag should be an all-ages thing, and some people consider it provocative.
[00:50:40.948 --> 00:50:41.948]  It's not inappropriate.
[00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:51.554]  It's not inappropriate.
[00:50:51.714 --> 00:50:53.535]  Teach the children.
[00:50:53.555 --> 00:50:55.876]  Teach the children.
[00:50:55.797 --> 00:50:59.797]  Teach the children.
[00:50:59.797 --> 00:51:02.797]  I'm all about education.
[00:51:02.797 --> 00:51:11.797]  [MUSIC]
[00:51:11.797 --> 00:51:14.797]  And everywhere else it's called pedophilia.
[00:51:15.233 --> 00:51:22.419]  But when it's done institutionally, and they can get away with people dressed up like demon clowns with your children.
[00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:25.042]  Pull up Tranny Time in the New York schools.
[00:51:25.262 --> 00:51:27.223]  This was put out in the New York Times, like it's wonderful.
[00:51:27.404 --> 00:51:31.347]  And it's the biggest scary looking group of weirdo pot-bellied men.
[00:51:31.387 --> 00:51:36.252]  Looks like a bunch of Dennis Hasterds running around with clown makeup on.
[00:51:36.792 --> 00:51:42.733]  Just hopping around, rubbing their giant bellies in front of children, and you're like, what alternate universe is this?
[00:51:43.273 --> 00:51:44.893]  What planet did I wake up in?
[00:51:46.434 --> 00:52:01.536]  So ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, Drag Queen story time has been going on for years now, but they've really kind of just dropped the story time from it, and now it's just dance time, strip time, touch time for kids with all of these perverts running around.
[00:52:01.996 --> 00:52:03.156]  It's totally inappropriate.
[00:52:03.757 --> 00:52:05.817]  It should be illegal if it's not already.
[00:52:06.457 --> 00:52:12.779]  And concerned parents all across the country are realizing that this is going on in the schools, in the libraries, even in the churches sometimes.
[00:52:13.259 --> 00:52:15.379]  And so Rob Dew is with me in studio.
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:17.040]  He's got a couple of kids.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.360]  He's concerned about this going on.
[00:52:19.981 --> 00:52:25.440]   And you were investigating a recent situation where there was a drag queen,
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:32.121]   where parents showed up and actually forced the drag queen out of, I guess it was a local library at the time.
[00:52:32.121 --> 00:52:35.740]   So talk about that story that you're gonna be covering today.
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:40.840]   And then more importantly though, just as a parent that has multiple kids in school right now,
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:45.840]   just how you're trying to make sure and monitor that your kids are not getting this propaganda
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:46.921]  when they go to school every day.
[00:52:47.087 --> 00:52:47.567]  Exactly.
[00:52:47.648 --> 00:52:50.250]  And I'm going to show you how they say we have an agenda.
[00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:51.030]  They admit it.
[00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:51.851]  They have an agenda.
[00:52:51.911 --> 00:53:01.659]  And then I'm going to show you examples of what the agenda is, which is what we saw in that video, you know, which is grown men laying down and having kids crawl on them.
[00:53:02.019 --> 00:53:07.059]   and it's going to get worse obviously. But what caught my eye was the original headlines.
[00:53:07.059 --> 00:53:12.499]   I saw Proud Boys members under hate crime investigation after shouting slurs at Drag
[00:53:12.499 --> 00:53:17.139]   Queen Story Hour. That's from The Hill, so you could see that one there. And in The Washington
[00:53:17.139 --> 00:53:23.698]   Post, Proud Boys disrupt Drag Queen reading event prompting hate crime probe. And I've
[00:53:23.698 --> 00:53:28.979]   got some news articles going with that, some news packages that I put, just a couple pieces
[00:53:28.979 --> 00:53:33.538]   I put together so people could see. But it's interesting, you go to the local CBS Bay Area
[00:53:33.538 --> 00:53:37.539]   and it says a group of men likely associated with the Proud Boys.
[00:53:37.711 --> 00:53:45.734]  So here in national media, they're being called Proud Boys, but in the local media, a group of men likely associated with, so we don't even know if they're really Proud Boys.
[00:53:45.754 --> 00:53:47.394]  And of course, we've seen this trend before.
[00:53:47.674 --> 00:53:49.175]  Oh, they are the Proud Boys.
[00:53:49.395 --> 00:53:50.695]  Oh, they're associated with the Proud Boys.
[00:53:50.795 --> 00:53:52.236]  Oh, they have nothing to do with the Proud Boys.
[00:53:52.656 --> 00:53:53.876]  So who knows what the truth is?
[00:53:54.296 --> 00:54:00.418]  But when this story first broke, I remember seeing that that's what was published everywhere was Proud Boys, Proud Boys, Proud Boys.
[00:54:00.438 --> 00:54:02.179]  And you never saw video with audio.
[00:54:02.199 --> 00:54:04.920]  You just saw the guy making the OK symbol.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.802]  Well, that's all we need to see to know they're white supremacist Proud Boys.
[00:54:08.842 --> 00:54:14.605]  And it's all about the demonization that's already happened with the Proud Boys and then furthering that demonization now.
[00:54:14.645 --> 00:54:17.266]  Whether this guy was involved with them or not, I guess we still don't know.
[00:54:17.326 --> 00:54:19.507]  Maybe you do know with your further investigations.
[00:54:19.928 --> 00:54:27.692]  But what's interesting to me is like, oh, so Proud Boys are the problem here, not the perverts showing up to touch children.
[00:54:27.952 --> 00:54:28.332]  Got it.
[00:54:28.612 --> 00:54:28.772]  Right.
[00:54:30.493 --> 00:54:35.919]  Very much due cause to go after this specific drag queen performer that was at this specific library.
[00:54:36.059 --> 00:54:44.689]  They went in there and they had video proof that they even showed the librarian of what this drag queen does in her spare time and what she says on video.
[00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:46.971]  And we're going to get to that.
[00:54:46.991 --> 00:54:48.432]  But first I want to show you the propaganda.
[00:54:48.772 --> 00:54:51.815]  We're going to go to the news packages 1A first.
[00:54:51.835 --> 00:54:55.137]  I'm going to show you how it was being shown to everybody in the world.
[00:54:55.437 --> 00:55:03.243]  Because then I found, after I watched these, then I saw the raw video from the men's perspective walking into the Drag Queen story.
[00:55:03.283 --> 00:55:04.564]  Like they had a point of view shot.
[00:55:04.964 --> 00:55:07.105]  Yeah, it's their cameras and they're talking.
[00:55:07.505 --> 00:55:10.386]  Completely different than what is being shown to you in these.
[00:55:10.706 --> 00:55:14.027]  And then there's some associations they try to make in some of these news packages.
[00:55:14.087 --> 00:55:17.708]  I put two of them together and let's roll the news packages clip.
[00:55:18.028 --> 00:55:24.070]  Investigators say the men shouted homophobic slurs at a drag queen who was trying to read to kids.
[00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:26.531]  Our Darlene talked to that drag queen.
[00:55:27.162 --> 00:55:30.224]  This time, it felt very close to violence.
[00:55:30.504 --> 00:55:31.385]  It was extremely loud.
[00:55:31.445 --> 00:55:36.644]   Drag queen Pana Dulce says these are some of the 8 to 10 men who walked into San Lorenzo
[00:55:36.644 --> 00:55:40.644]   Public Library Saturday afternoon to stop the book reading event.
[00:55:40.644 --> 00:55:42.445]  It was extremely loud.
[00:55:42.445 --> 00:55:46.804]   There was a cacophony of voices just yelling over one another, taunting me, calling me
[00:55:46.804 --> 00:55:50.484]  a groomer, a pedophile, a tranny, an it.
[00:55:50.918 --> 00:55:54.261]  Asking, like interrogating the parents, why are you bringing your kids to this?
[00:55:54.281 --> 00:55:55.382]  That sounds accurate so far.
[00:55:55.622 --> 00:56:01.307]  Because one of them was wearing a shirt with an AK-47 on it, and it said, uh, kill your local pedophile.
[00:56:01.327 --> 00:56:02.949]  He didn't like that, huh?
[00:56:02.989 --> 00:56:04.170]  He didn't like that, that offended him.
[00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:05.050]  He took that personally.
[00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:08.870]  He took that personally.
[00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:12.230]  Fear, confusion, alarm.
[00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:16.510]   Library staff say the men wouldn't leave and the rhetoric was escalating so they called
[00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:18.229]  the sheriff's office immediately.
[00:56:18.312 --> 00:56:20.834]  We removed the performer from the room.
[00:56:20.854 --> 00:56:21.534]  Nice face mask.
[00:56:21.554 --> 00:56:22.375]  He comes back in later.
[00:56:22.395 --> 00:56:26.318]  Then we invited the parents and children to exit the room as well.
[00:56:26.478 --> 00:56:39.068]  But even after going through all of that, both the performer and the staff felt very strong about continuing with their reading event, so they ended up covering up all of the open windows with anything they could find, just to help the families feel more comfortable.
[00:56:39.168 --> 00:56:41.430]  Oh, they don't want anyone seeing what they're doing.
[00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:42.331]  Reminds me of the 2020 elections.
[00:56:42.371 --> 00:56:42.671]  Oh my gosh.
[00:56:42.691 --> 00:56:43.992]  They try to associate it with this.
[00:56:44.012 --> 00:56:45.153]  Which is a different state.
[00:56:44.993 --> 00:56:47.432]  into the annoying and harassing of children.
[00:56:47.432 --> 00:56:51.433]   Deputies want to assure the community that as people celebrate Pride Month,
[00:56:51.433 --> 00:56:55.533]   deputies will be swift in their response to any threats toward this community.
[00:56:55.533 --> 00:56:59.373]   Same night of the Drag Queen Story Hour event, a truck full of masked men,
[00:56:59.373 --> 00:57:04.773]   believed to be part of a white nationalist group, was arrested here at Idaho's Pride in the Park event.
[00:57:04.773 --> 00:57:06.953]  They are charged with conspiring to riot.
[00:57:06.953 --> 00:57:11.653]   And by the way, that was a law enforcement, that was a law enforcement FBI infiltrated deal.
[00:57:11.654 --> 00:57:14.136]  Well, and I don't know if I printed the picture.
[00:57:14.156 --> 00:57:17.258]  If you can go back to one of the stills of the Patriot Front guys.
[00:57:17.298 --> 00:57:19.480]  Actually, I put the Patriot Front photos in there.
[00:57:20.561 --> 00:57:21.401]  And you guys can pull them up.
[00:57:21.762 --> 00:57:22.682]  Notice how they look.
[00:57:23.203 --> 00:57:23.983]  All their faces are still there.
[00:57:24.003 --> 00:57:24.544]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:57:24.604 --> 00:57:25.665]  We gotta go to a break now.
[00:57:25.685 --> 00:57:25.945]  It's crazy.
[00:57:26.065 --> 00:57:28.807]  Because I got some news on that Patriot Front as well.
[00:57:28.967 --> 00:57:31.809]  And let's respond to the news report that we just saw.
[00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:33.050]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:33.891 --> 00:57:36.653]  I mean, I'm just, I'm in the Twilight Zone here, folks.
[00:57:37.133 --> 00:57:42.476]  I mean, Nancy Pelosi made a statement saying drag is what America is all about.
[00:57:42.556 --> 00:57:44.117]  She went on some drag queen show.
[00:57:44.777 --> 00:57:46.118]  Drag is what America is all about.
[00:57:46.218 --> 00:57:48.579]  Is she saying the Founding Fathers were drag queens?
[00:57:48.599 --> 00:57:49.320]  Is that what she's saying?
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:50.200]  I'm not really sure.
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:51.881]  Drag is what America is all about?
[00:57:51.921 --> 00:57:52.841]  What, drag racing?
[00:57:53.122 --> 00:57:55.163]  I think she's confusing the powdered wigs with...
[00:57:55.825 --> 00:57:58.967]  Actually, dressing up in makeup and performing vaudeville tunes.
[00:57:59.767 --> 00:58:04.090]  Drag is what America's all about, says Nancy Pelosi, who's been in office for 700 years.
[00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:05.391]  Wow.
[00:58:05.451 --> 00:58:06.771]  That tells you where their head is at.
[00:58:07.432 --> 00:58:08.332]  And it's not a good place.
[00:58:08.372 --> 00:58:35.244]   But you know, I'm sitting here in the Twilight Zone with Rob Dew, who's a concerned parent, who's looking at all this drag queen story time, which is targeting the children, and it's just like, how does somebody with a straight face do a news report on that, And say that it's the men harassing children when it's a grown man dressed like a woman who's the one there indoctrinating and harassing children to anybody else's rationally thinking point of view.
[00:58:35.284 --> 00:58:38.244]  I mean, I'm just in total Twilight Zone land here.
[00:58:38.604 --> 00:58:41.065]  Why does this guy want to perform so badly in front of children?
[00:58:41.365 --> 00:58:42.485]  I guess that would be my question.
[00:58:42.865 --> 00:58:45.486]  Why are you so desperate to perform in front of children?
[00:58:45.666 --> 00:58:51.530]  Yeah, that's a great question, actually, because we see some of these guys have been convicted sex offenders that are in Houston.
[00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:52.611]  They found two of them, at least.
[00:58:53.371 --> 00:58:55.052]  And I don't think they do background checks on these people.
[00:58:55.072 --> 00:58:56.093]  There's two of them here in Austin!
[00:58:56.113 --> 00:58:56.553]  They go, yeah.
[00:58:56.694 --> 00:58:58.935]  They go, you want to be a, you're a drag performer?
[00:58:59.055 --> 00:58:59.776]  Oh, come on in.
[00:58:59.996 --> 00:59:00.676]  Touch the kids.
[00:59:00.936 --> 00:59:01.437]  Have fun.
[00:59:01.737 --> 00:59:02.578]  Bring them, bring them in here.
[00:59:02.618 --> 00:59:03.858]  And it's, it's really disgusting.
[00:59:04.139 --> 00:59:11.924]  And so, just so everybody knows, you can go find Local Heroes, Drive Vile, Drag Queen from Library Story Hour, raw video, on, on Bandop Video.
[00:59:12.544 --> 00:59:14.286]  It's been put up there, so people can go watch.
[00:59:15.246 --> 00:59:17.187]  Everything of what we're playing clips of.
[00:59:17.848 --> 00:59:19.489]  But I just want to go back to one thing.
[00:59:19.509 --> 00:59:25.673]  They try to associate these people with Proud Boys, even though there may have been one guy wearing possibly a Proud Boy hat.
[00:59:25.693 --> 00:59:26.293]  We don't even know.
[00:59:27.374 --> 00:59:28.254]  But here's the thing.
[00:59:28.294 --> 00:59:31.116]  The reason they want to call them Proud Boys is here's an NPR article from 2021.
[00:59:32.116 --> 00:59:34.078]  Proud Boys named terrorist entity in Canada.
[00:59:34.498 --> 00:59:37.600]  So they're they're trying to say, if you're a Proud Boy, you're a domestic terrorist.
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:41.382]  Anything you do is wrong and we can go at you full force.
[00:59:41.422 --> 00:59:44.644]  So they want to use the full force of the law against anybody they call a Proud Boy.
[00:59:44.704 --> 00:59:48.145]  Yeah, anybody against the corporate government regime is now a domestic terrorist.
[00:59:48.225 --> 00:59:48.665]  Exactly.
[00:59:49.365 --> 00:59:52.806]  And so they don't like that, but then we saw these Patriot Front guys.
[00:59:53.066 --> 00:59:54.826]  I looked at most of these guys who were in the library.
[00:59:55.406 --> 00:59:57.607]  Most of them didn't have, I think one or two had masks on.
[00:59:57.647 --> 01:00:03.948]  You look at the Patriot Front guys that were arrested, which is why I wanted to bring those pictures up again, is they all have their masks on still.
[01:00:04.269 --> 01:00:05.749]  Do you see any of them unmasked right there?
[01:00:06.656 --> 01:00:08.737]  All the cops don't have any masks on.
[01:00:08.797 --> 01:00:13.600]  They all have masks on and they're being left on after they've been detained.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:18.903]  I think that's a very weird and very telling sign of they don't want these people to be known.
[01:00:18.923 --> 01:00:20.644]  They don't want photos of these people coming out.
[01:00:20.864 --> 01:00:22.004]  They don't want any information.
[01:00:22.044 --> 01:00:24.786]  They just want these people to be there for a photo op.
[01:00:24.946 --> 01:00:52.475]   Well I've got some news on that and I don't want to get into it now because I know we want to continue covering the drag stuff but but let's just say we'll come back on that story later maybe even with Rob doing studio because I've got some news on that folks I haven't been covering this intentionally because I've known that something was gonna something there's gonna be a crack in that story it's gonna kind of open up to what the truth is I think we finally have it today but getting back to the put the pervert drag Well, and we're going to go back to the raw footage that the young men who went in there to stop this event shot themselves.
[01:00:52.535 --> 01:00:53.435]  It's from their point of view.
[01:00:53.575 --> 01:00:56.136]  I found the full thing, you can find that on BAM.
[01:00:56.156 --> 01:01:01.298]  But here's this local, I call it local heroes clip one, because I think these guys are heroes for stopping this.
[01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:10.762]  Especially when you see, I'm going to show you in video two, and I've got to warn the parents, you want to turn your kids away from what you're going to see in this next second video, but we'll play the first from first.
[01:01:10.802 --> 01:01:14.083]  Yeah, in other words, if you wouldn't take your kid to Drag Queen Storytime, don't let them see this.
[01:01:14.183 --> 01:01:14.743]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:01:15.947 --> 01:01:20.052]  Who brought the pedophile?
[01:01:20.192 --> 01:01:20.612]  No, thank you.
[01:01:20.632 --> 01:01:21.493]  Who brought the pedophile?
[01:01:22.134 --> 01:01:23.616]  Gotta wear your mask.
[01:01:23.636 --> 01:01:24.977]  No, the drag queen isn't wearing a mask.
[01:01:24.997 --> 01:01:25.979]  Who brought the pedophile?
[01:01:25.999 --> 01:01:26.499]  I just want to know.
[01:01:26.318 --> 01:01:26.818]  Thank you, though.
[01:01:26.818 --> 01:01:30.438]  Who brought the pedophile?
[01:01:30.438 --> 01:01:31.719]  I just want to know.
[01:01:31.719 --> 01:01:35.719]  Well, then why is the pedophile here?
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.061]  No, no, no.
[01:01:38.121 --> 01:01:39.481]  We want to know why there's a pedophile here.
[01:01:39.802 --> 01:01:41.543]  We saw videos of what that thing does.
[01:01:41.563 --> 01:01:41.843]  Yeah.
[01:01:42.323 --> 01:01:43.284]  They mentioned the videos.
[01:01:43.664 --> 01:01:44.384]  Hey, it's not videos.
[01:01:44.444 --> 01:01:45.165]  It's a video about pedophiles.
[01:01:45.225 --> 01:01:46.606]  What it wants to do to little children.
[01:01:46.766 --> 01:01:47.206]  Yeah.
[01:01:47.646 --> 01:01:49.968]  Why do you watch videos on YouTube of what it wants to do to little children?
[01:01:50.008 --> 01:01:52.689]  Hey, notice the symbology on the top left there on that slide.
[01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:53.630]  The little spiral.
[01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:54.850]  Yeah, the little pedophile spiral.
[01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:56.171]  Why would you bring your children to a pedophile?
[01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:56.531]  It's not her.
[01:01:56.551 --> 01:01:57.252]  It's not her.
[01:01:57.632 --> 01:01:58.632]  It's not her, right?
[01:01:58.673 --> 01:02:00.013]  You should be ashamed of yourself.
[01:02:01.574 --> 01:02:02.655]  You should be ashamed of yourself.
[01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:05.565]  Why would you want to bring children to this?
[01:02:05.705 --> 01:02:07.586]  Why would you want to expose your children to this?
[01:02:07.626 --> 01:02:10.229]  Just to prove how tolerant you are of pedophiles?
[01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:12.210]  She wanted to be tolerant?
[01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:13.091]  That's the name of the book.
[01:02:13.211 --> 01:02:16.794]  That's book number one.
[01:02:16.934 --> 01:02:19.977]  And there's the haunter right there in the library.
[01:02:20.017 --> 01:02:25.021]  That thing has videos talking about what it's like to be away from the children.
[01:02:25.062 --> 01:02:26.182]  Look, we've got a pedophile here.
[01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:27.504]  We're in Giants.
[01:02:27.624 --> 01:02:29.385]  Oh yeah, I'm having some fun with the Giants again.
[01:02:29.705 --> 01:02:30.566]  This is sick!
[01:02:30.586 --> 01:02:32.168]  You guys are sick!
[01:02:32.188 --> 01:02:33.829]  Look it, they brought kids here!
[01:02:33.869 --> 01:02:35.150]  What is wrong with you people?
[01:02:35.951 --> 01:02:37.072]  What is wrong with you?
[01:02:37.752 --> 01:02:38.433]  What is wrong with you?
[01:02:39.074 --> 01:02:40.014]  Tell me, what is wrong with you?
[01:02:40.034 --> 01:02:41.916]  This is a very fit security guard moving in.
[01:02:41.956 --> 01:02:42.697]  Yeah, she's healthy.
[01:02:42.757 --> 01:02:43.758]  This is sick!
[01:02:43.958 --> 01:02:44.698]  This is sick!
[01:02:44.778 --> 01:02:47.040]  Oh, there's the other one.
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.642]  There's a pedophile here with children!
[01:02:49.042 --> 01:02:50.063]  There's a trend going on.
[01:02:50.083 --> 01:02:51.224]  This is disgusting!
[01:02:51.584 --> 01:02:54.087]  What the hell is wrong with you people?
[01:02:54.107 --> 01:02:55.067]  These poor children!
[01:02:55.168 --> 01:02:56.869]  What is wrong with you sick people?
[01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:58.831]  Get out of here, you pedophile!
[01:02:59.051 --> 01:02:59.672]  Get out of here!
[01:03:00.292 --> 01:03:01.113]  You're not safe here!
[01:03:01.413 --> 01:03:01.974]  Get out of here!
[01:03:03.035 --> 01:03:05.477]  So, I didn't see any harassment of children going on right there.
[01:03:05.797 --> 01:03:06.037]  No.
[01:03:06.318 --> 01:03:10.601]  Well, I'm sure there was before the guys disrupted the pedophile pervert.
[01:03:10.722 --> 01:03:11.442]  These poor children!
[01:03:12.123 --> 01:03:13.364]  These poor children!
[01:03:14.165 --> 01:03:15.206]  How dare you guys!
[01:03:16.504 --> 01:03:17.705]  So that's just part of it.
[01:03:17.825 --> 01:03:21.727]  They drive the pedophile from the story hour, which to me is a heroic act.
[01:03:21.747 --> 01:03:24.989]  And there's the security guard performing with the drag queen.
[01:03:25.489 --> 01:03:30.832]  But notice, everything they do has a sexual angle to it, okay?
[01:03:31.832 --> 01:03:35.774]  So the drag queen is dressed up like a baseball cheerleader.
[01:03:36.415 --> 01:03:36.975]  You notice that?
[01:03:37.195 --> 01:03:41.738]  That's like this weird fetish, this weird fantasy of, oh, I'm a baseball cheerleader.
[01:03:42.665 --> 01:03:44.287]  And I mean, I'll stop it right there.
[01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:46.169]  But you know what she's thinking.
[01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:48.252]  She's wanting to play with bats and balls, okay?
[01:03:48.432 --> 01:03:50.815]  Tell your kids to turn away right now.
[01:03:50.835 --> 01:03:55.982]  I do show in this one clip a clip of what this drag queen performer puts out on video.
[01:03:56.002 --> 01:03:56.302]  Here it is.
[01:03:57.363 --> 01:03:58.605]  You godless whores!
[01:03:58.665 --> 01:03:59.786]  You guys are sick!
[01:04:01.767 --> 01:04:02.587]  It's not okay.
[01:04:03.188 --> 01:04:05.148]  You're not starting it again.
[01:04:05.448 --> 01:04:06.108]  This is over.
[01:04:06.749 --> 01:04:07.249]  This is over.
[01:04:07.389 --> 01:04:08.649]  There's the librarian right there.
[01:04:08.749 --> 01:04:10.590]  No more sick pedophiles here.
[01:04:11.570 --> 01:04:12.291]  You are sick.
[01:04:12.851 --> 01:04:13.491]  You are sick.
[01:04:13.531 --> 01:04:14.931]  You guys are sick.
[01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:15.412]  Ah, game over.
[01:04:15.472 --> 01:04:17.572]  There's a dude dressed in a, as a female.
[01:04:17.432 --> 01:04:18.432]  Would you like to see?
[01:04:18.432 --> 01:04:19.432]  You guys are sick.
[01:04:19.432 --> 01:04:20.432]  How many more children have left?
[01:04:20.432 --> 01:04:21.432]  Would you like to see?
[01:04:21.432 --> 01:04:22.432]  Would you like to see?
[01:04:22.432 --> 01:04:23.432]  Wow, game over.
[01:04:23.432 --> 01:04:25.432]  There's a dude dressed as a female.
[01:04:25.432 --> 01:04:28.432]  Yeah, so that's definitely a Proud Boys shirt there too.
[01:04:29.437 --> 01:04:31.037]  You anti-feminist woman!
[01:04:31.438 --> 01:04:32.958]  You guys are sick!
[01:04:32.998 --> 01:04:34.079]  You guys are sick!
[01:04:34.259 --> 01:04:36.120]  I think you're just having fun.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:36.801]  No, there's no fun!
[01:04:36.821 --> 01:04:37.501]  We're just having fun.
[01:04:37.521 --> 01:04:38.361]  Did you hear the mom say that?
[01:04:38.381 --> 01:04:39.222]  We're just having fun.
[01:04:39.302 --> 01:04:40.783]  I'm sure the pedophile's having fun.
[01:04:40.943 --> 01:04:42.744]  There is no enjoying children being abused.
[01:04:42.924 --> 01:04:44.365]  So, thank you, you can leave.
[01:04:44.425 --> 01:04:46.166]  Yeah, we're here to protect the children.
[01:04:46.406 --> 01:04:47.086]  Because you won't.
[01:04:47.827 --> 01:04:53.610]  What's going to happen is we call the police and you're disrupting a library.
[01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:55.531]  Oh, the poor tranny can't read to the children!
[01:04:57.014 --> 01:04:59.457]  Not that there's no kids in here, watch this video.
[01:04:59.557 --> 01:05:00.578]  Hey, thank you.
[01:05:00.638 --> 01:05:01.078]  Right there.
[01:05:02.039 --> 01:05:03.000]  He brings a rosary.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.062]  So now they're showing the library in the video?
[01:05:05.302 --> 01:05:07.124]  Right, I'm gonna cut to it here in a second.
[01:05:06.943 --> 01:05:08.943]  Mercy, you stay here in a second.
[01:05:08.943 --> 01:05:10.943]  That is not what's happening.
[01:05:10.943 --> 01:05:12.943]  That's the thing that's leading to these kids.
[01:05:12.943 --> 01:05:14.943]  There's talks about children in this video.
[01:05:14.943 --> 01:05:16.943]  [Music]
[01:05:16.943 --> 01:05:18.943]  [Music]
[01:05:18.943 --> 01:05:20.943]  [Music]
[01:05:20.943 --> 01:05:22.943]  [Music]
[01:05:23.206 --> 01:05:26.608]  I never said I was a role model.
[01:05:26.648 --> 01:05:28.109]  Here's the kicker, right here.
[01:05:27.929 --> 01:05:30.168]  You condone driving while intoxicated?
[01:05:30.168 --> 01:05:31.367]  [BURP]
[01:05:31.367 --> 01:05:33.128]  I never said I was a role model.
[01:05:33.128 --> 01:05:34.969]  Here's the kicker, right here.
[01:05:34.969 --> 01:05:37.367]  Do you have a message for them?
[01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:40.367]  All the kids looking up to me can stop my [BLEEP]
[01:05:40.367 --> 01:05:41.889]  and quit their mother [BLEEP]
[01:05:41.889 --> 01:05:44.048]  drink till I'm sick!
[01:05:43.088 --> 01:05:43.789]  Drink it full!
[01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:45.831]  And put nudges down the hole!
[01:05:45.911 --> 01:05:48.373]  Watch you laugh and cry while I laugh you die!
[01:05:48.633 --> 01:05:49.534]  And all the dudes!
[01:05:49.795 --> 01:05:51.476]  You know I'm talking to you!
[01:05:51.756 --> 01:05:52.537]  We love you Natalie!
[01:05:52.617 --> 01:05:54.219]  I wanna fuck you too!
[01:05:58.616 --> 01:06:02.239]  Is this who you want performing for your kids?
[01:06:02.259 --> 01:06:04.741]  That's that person right there.
[01:06:04.861 --> 01:06:08.804]  Now they're showing it to the librarian.
[01:06:08.884 --> 01:06:09.925]  Same exact video.
[01:06:09.945 --> 01:06:10.725]  This is disgusting.
[01:06:10.805 --> 01:06:12.987]  I mean, there's all kinds of sexual innuendo there.
[01:06:13.127 --> 01:06:13.968]  It's horrible.
[01:06:14.448 --> 01:06:14.928]  It's horrible.
[01:06:14.948 --> 01:06:16.870]  And they're bringing this... It's the same drag queen.
[01:06:17.506 --> 01:06:20.007]  And we've got concerned parent Rob Dew in studio with us.
[01:06:20.507 --> 01:06:24.329]  Rob, before we went to the last break, we were just showing this video on the screen.
[01:06:25.709 --> 01:06:36.153]  It's a deranged, perverted individual that, if that man wants to do that in his own free time, I would not care, I would not notice, I would have nothing to do with it.
[01:06:36.193 --> 01:07:04.366]   But now that uh... sexual deviant perverted man with all kind of sexual innuendo and just direct uh... sex references in the little music video now performs for children they call it drag queen story time and you know rob i think people are finally realizing how sick it is the debate is is it time to do good men and women have to stand up to put an end to this or do we just turn a blind eye and say look if these people want to groom and give their kids to pedophiles i mean i guess
[01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:06.161]  Guess we let him do it!
[01:07:06.762 --> 01:07:15.367]  Well, those are the two choices, but I choose to follow what these local heroes did and go in and stand up for their community and just say no.
[01:07:16.208 --> 01:07:18.409]  And I think what really triggered them was the video we saw.
[01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:25.653]  That video that that drag queen performer put out where she mouths the words, hey kids who follow me can suck my ding dong.
[01:07:26.474 --> 01:07:32.738]  And by the way, most of these drag queen performers, folks, you can go find pretty much very similar, if not exact same content.
[01:07:33.226 --> 01:07:37.228]  I mean, we showed one, one time, uh, pulling a fake baby out of the oven.
[01:07:37.248 --> 01:07:40.850]  Like they were cooking a baby, you know, it's, it's, it's disgusting stuff.
[01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:44.533]  There's, and that's, that's what goes on in their own private time.
[01:07:44.593 --> 01:07:44.933]  Whatever.
[01:07:45.293 --> 01:07:46.474]  Don't go bring it around kids.
[01:07:46.514 --> 01:07:50.436]   Don't be showing up to kids and I think this program is despicable.
[01:07:50.536 --> 01:07:55.540]  Now, here's what the head of the, I didn't even know there was an executive director of Drag Queen Story Hour, but there is.
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:56.661]  His name is Jonathan Hamlet.
[01:07:57.261 --> 01:08:03.185]  And he said, any attempt to criminalize our work is rooted in tired homophobic and transphobic hate and misinformation.
[01:08:03.585 --> 01:08:13.892]  We refuse to give in to politicians who are too bigoted and boring to comprehend our vision for the world in which every child can safely, can be safe fully expressing who they are.
[01:08:15.074 --> 01:08:16.856]  You know, I don't think that's ever been a problem, Rob.
[01:08:17.016 --> 01:08:18.858]  I don't think kids have a problem expressing themselves.
[01:08:18.938 --> 01:08:21.982]  I don't think they need Drag Queen performers to goad them into doing what they're doing.
[01:08:22.002 --> 01:08:24.224]  I think pedophiles getting access to kids, that's the problem.
[01:08:24.244 --> 01:08:25.966]  That's the shortages that they're trying to address.
[01:08:26.127 --> 01:08:26.948]  That is the problem.
[01:08:27.388 --> 01:08:28.810]  And we have some examples.
[01:08:29.651 --> 01:08:32.334]  Drag Queen flashes young kids at Drag Queen Story Hour.
[01:08:32.354 --> 01:08:33.475]  This is from the post-millennial.
[01:08:34.136 --> 01:08:40.438]  So, uh, we've seen that, and there came the last case, I guess, killing a pedophile, or beating up a pedophile.
[01:08:40.678 --> 01:08:43.699]  Used to be a hero for doing that, now the left... Now they want to attack him.
[01:08:43.959 --> 01:08:46.080]  So here's, here's a drag queen performer flashing him.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.300]  Uh, here's another one.
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:48.500]  Second drag queen story.
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:51.601]  Our reader in Houston exposed as convicted child sex offender.
[01:08:51.621 --> 01:08:52.341]  This is convicted.
[01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:55.402]  This isn't, oh, we, they put something out on, on video.
[01:08:55.662 --> 01:08:57.163]  No, this is convicted.
[01:08:59.404 --> 01:09:05.488]  Oh, okay.
[01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:19.157]  I'm starting to see a bit of a pattern going on here, that these people who want to be around kids have these perversions in them, and then they make videos of it.
[01:09:19.177 --> 01:09:20.118]  So what are we supposed to think?
[01:09:20.138 --> 01:09:21.819]  Are we supposed to think, oh, that's nuanced?
[01:09:21.859 --> 01:09:22.659]  That's not nuanced.
[01:09:22.679 --> 01:09:24.480]  That's in-your-face, smoke my ding-dong.
[01:09:25.481 --> 01:09:28.443]  There were two stories that I followed up with here in Texas.
[01:09:29.084 --> 01:09:32.586]  One was with a drag queen that was getting access to kids called Ms.
[01:09:32.686 --> 01:09:33.207]  Kitty Litter.
[01:09:33.287 --> 01:09:39.831]  I didn't know this, but kitty litter is like a sexual phrase for, excuse me folks, but eating butthole.
[01:09:39.851 --> 01:09:43.234]  Okay, I don't know what else, I don't know how else to describe it.
[01:09:43.254 --> 01:09:44.455]  I mean, that's what it is, kitty litter.
[01:09:44.895 --> 01:09:50.259]  Oh, we didn't even go to the Dallas one where they had the sign that said it's not going to lick itself and they were having a drag queen performance for kids.
[01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:59.405]  I mean, I'm not trying to be inappropriate, but it's like, come on, if I, if I had a name, if I had a stage name of, you know, long boner and said, Oh, I'm going to go perform for kids.
[01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:00.826]  Look, long boner for kids.
[01:10:00.846 --> 01:10:01.486]  I mean, that's Ms.
[01:10:01.526 --> 01:10:01.826]  Keeler.
[01:10:02.046 --> 01:10:06.930]  There was another one that I was following up with and mass resistance, Texas just broke this recently.
[01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:11.393]  One of the more recent drag queen story time for kids speakers.
[01:10:13.021 --> 01:10:19.405]  Eleven priors, including one for sodomy crimes against nature.
[01:10:19.425 --> 01:10:20.786]  Wow.
[01:10:20.886 --> 01:10:22.747]  Do you even want to guess what that is?
[01:10:23.227 --> 01:10:25.989]  It could be a tree, it could be a cow, it could be a dog, I don't know.
[01:10:26.069 --> 01:10:27.550]  But that was one of the eleven charges.
[01:10:30.179 --> 01:10:35.458]   You can't have this going on. They have these things in place. I saw a graph the other day too. They showed
[01:10:35.458 --> 01:10:41.858]   uh sexual abuse in schools from from teachers and the numbers way up here per year of incidents and then
[01:10:41.858 --> 01:10:46.658]   They have they show the catholic church and it's like 210, but it's like thousands in the public schools
[01:10:46.658 --> 01:10:50.238]   And there's a problem going on and you look at some of these lives of tiktok
[01:10:50.238 --> 01:10:52.819]   videos and you understand why and they think that some sort of
[01:10:52.819 --> 01:10:56.367]   Like own where they're like, oh really But the Catholic Church has pedophiles.
[01:10:56.667 --> 01:10:58.688]  Uh, yeah, we're against that, too.
[01:10:58.788 --> 01:10:59.649]  Like, what are you talking about?
[01:10:59.709 --> 01:11:00.530]  Everybody's against that.
[01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:01.670]  Exactly.
[01:11:02.111 --> 01:11:05.112]  But what's going on, it's not just at these Drag Queen Storytimes.
[01:11:05.172 --> 01:11:06.693]  It's going in on the universities.
[01:11:07.054 --> 01:11:12.533]   Here's ODU professor placed on administrative leave after comments on pedophilia, said to
[01:11:12.533 --> 01:11:15.614]  use the term minor attracted person instead of pedophile.
[01:11:15.614 --> 01:11:19.413]   So we're going to say it's okay essentially that this person likes kids.
[01:11:19.413 --> 01:11:21.054]  He's a minor attracted person.
[01:11:21.054 --> 01:11:22.413]  Yeah, maps is what they call them.
[01:11:22.413 --> 01:11:24.092]  And this, it kind of brought me back to that.
[01:11:24.092 --> 01:11:25.092]  I'm not convinced.
[01:11:25.092 --> 01:11:26.092]  It just made me think.
[01:11:26.092 --> 01:11:31.173]   But remember the WikiLeaks emails, the Democrat WikiLeaks emails, Podesta and others, where
[01:11:31.173 --> 01:11:35.592]   they talked about maps, pizza related maps and almond maps and stuff like that.
[01:11:35.592 --> 01:11:39.592]   We all thought it was actually like a map, like to find an area.
[01:11:39.717 --> 01:11:40.718]  Maybe it was something else.
[01:11:40.778 --> 01:11:42.459]  Maybe it was a different man or a different person.
[01:11:42.479 --> 01:11:44.441]  We never got any answers or investigations into that.
[01:11:44.521 --> 01:11:46.162]  We see this professor was doing this.
[01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:46.963]  Here's another one.
[01:11:47.023 --> 01:11:51.446]  Queer ethics professor calls for pedophilia to be destigmatized and taught in schools.
[01:11:52.667 --> 01:11:54.389]  Destigmatized and taught in schools.
[01:11:54.469 --> 01:11:55.089]  Pedophilia.
[01:11:56.911 --> 01:12:00.053]  Furious four-year-old encouraged to touch naked man at art exhibition.
[01:12:00.714 --> 01:12:03.035]  There's the queer ethics professor again, but here's the other one.
[01:12:03.096 --> 01:12:04.437]  Is that the one where he's bending over?
[01:12:05.467 --> 01:12:05.747]  No.
[01:12:06.568 --> 01:12:08.809]  I almost can't even believe that.
[01:12:08.889 --> 01:12:10.530]  That one that I saw, I did a reverse image search.
[01:12:10.570 --> 01:12:11.811]  I can't even find where it is.
[01:12:11.851 --> 01:12:14.813]  But from where it is, I think they're trying to erase that image.
[01:12:14.833 --> 01:12:16.974]  But we're going to show that later and it's truly disturbing.
[01:12:17.334 --> 01:12:18.595]  But here's a professor from New York.
[01:12:18.775 --> 01:12:19.395]  This is a video.
[01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:21.897]  It's a mistake to think pedophilia is wrong.
[01:12:21.917 --> 01:12:27.660]  This is a professor, a paid professor in New York is stating this on video publicly for the world to see.
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.861]  So this is clip number four.
[01:12:29.619 --> 01:12:34.581]  Imagine that an adult male wants to have sex with a 12-year-old girl.
[01:12:35.081 --> 01:12:36.442]  Imagine that she's a willing participant.
[01:12:37.542 --> 01:12:41.284]  A very standard, very widely held view that there's something deeply wrong about this.
[01:12:41.604 --> 01:12:43.805]  And it's wrong independent of it being criminalized.
[01:12:44.865 --> 01:12:46.726]  It's not obvious to me that it is in fact wrong.
[01:12:46.826 --> 01:12:47.827]  I think this is a mistake.
[01:12:48.247 --> 01:12:57.951]  And I think that exploring why it's a mistake will tell us not only things about adult child sex and statutory rape, but also about fundamental principles of morality.
[01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:01.210]  That is so disgusting, I can't even believe it.
[01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:02.091]  It's ridiculous.
[01:13:02.411 --> 01:13:06.574]  And, you know, remember the gay men's choir that was saying, we're coming for your children, we're coming for your children?
[01:13:06.855 --> 01:13:13.880]  We saw videos of the drag queen performer in the city council meeting saying, we have an agenda, we're coming for you.
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:16.902]  It's about grooming the next generation, I think is what he said, those are the exact words.
[01:13:18.163 --> 01:13:22.206]  So they, oh, they got death threats after they put out a video saying we're coming for your children.
[01:13:22.406 --> 01:13:23.287]  We're coming for your children.
[01:13:23.327 --> 01:13:24.067]  People didn't like that.
[01:13:24.187 --> 01:13:30.312]  Oh, oh, we can't be against this, that we have to just accept this of them saying we're coming for your children.
[01:13:30.612 --> 01:13:31.353]  And then they admit.
[01:13:32.393 --> 01:13:34.535]  And they go, oh, this song is tongue-in-cheek, it's satirical.
[01:13:34.775 --> 01:13:36.376]  But we do have a gay agenda.
[01:13:36.697 --> 01:13:39.218]  We do have, they admit they do have a gay agenda.
[01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:42.661]  And they're saying, oh, it's just to make them tolerant, just to make these kids tolerant.
[01:13:43.956 --> 01:13:52.884]  I don't know what world this is where, in order to show this tolerance, you have to let your kids go up to these drag queen performers and roll on them.
[01:13:52.924 --> 01:13:53.744]  It's a sacrifice.
[01:13:53.824 --> 01:13:55.025]  It's like a sacrifice to Moloch.
[01:13:55.125 --> 01:13:55.426]  It really is.
[01:13:55.786 --> 01:13:58.668]  And they think, oh, I'm going to sacrifice my kids on the altar of tolerance.
[01:13:58.688 --> 01:13:59.729]  That's really what's going on.
[01:14:00.090 --> 01:14:02.432]  And it's truly, truly disgusting.
[01:14:02.492 --> 01:14:03.953]  And shame on these parents for doing this.
[01:14:04.213 --> 01:14:07.095]  Shame on these schools for letting these teachers still work.
[01:14:07.716 --> 01:14:10.298]  I mean, it's just insanity.
[01:14:10.338 --> 01:14:12.160]  It's a slope that goes straight into hell.
[01:14:13.473 --> 01:14:14.214]  It's a mad world.
[01:14:14.414 --> 01:14:15.034]  It's a mad world.
[01:14:15.074 --> 01:14:15.995]  I can't believe it's going on.
[01:14:16.536 --> 01:14:17.457]  And I can't believe it either.
[01:14:17.757 --> 01:14:24.023]  And here, and then, and then you have, this kind of ties in with the Proud Boys being the domestic terrorists in Canada.
[01:14:24.363 --> 01:14:29.808]  Well, Greg Stube put out a, he's a congressman representative, he said, hey, Secretary Mayorkas and A.G.
[01:14:29.848 --> 01:14:32.470]  Garland found some domestic terrorists for you, and it's a D.C.
[01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:37.254]  called Action Night of Rage, and it says on there, you said you'd riot, hit the streets.
[01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:39.016]  So who are these people?
[01:14:39.096 --> 01:14:40.297]  Are they being investigated?
[01:14:40.437 --> 01:14:43.759]  They're calling for a riot over the Roe vs. Wade decision.
[01:14:44.259 --> 01:14:45.860]  But are we going to see any investigation?
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:46.921]  Are we going to see any arrests?
[01:14:46.961 --> 01:14:49.843]  No, we're not going to see anything because they're allowed to do this.
[01:14:49.963 --> 01:14:54.666]  Some groups are allowed to go and touch kids and do these types of things and riot.
[01:14:55.086 --> 01:14:59.289]  And some people, oh, if they go stop it, oh no, they're getting investigated for a hate crime.
[01:14:59.309 --> 01:15:02.831]  Remember, they would share that picture of Donald Trump with Ivanka on his lap.
[01:15:03.071 --> 01:15:03.291]  Oh yeah.
[01:15:03.451 --> 01:15:05.713]  And they'd say, look how inappropriate, look how perverted.
[01:15:06.073 --> 01:15:06.273]  Right.
[01:15:06.413 --> 01:15:10.817]  Okay, maybe, you know, I probably wouldn't take a picture like that, but... Well, let me show you something that's inappropriate.
[01:15:11.598 --> 01:15:12.639]  Oh, let's look at this.
[01:15:12.679 --> 01:15:16.002]  This is at a museum, and I can't even... This thing has been excised off the internet.
[01:15:16.322 --> 01:15:17.443]  I can't even believe this.
[01:15:17.543 --> 01:15:21.047]  After this video went up, they're like, this is so vile.
[01:15:21.667 --> 01:15:24.430]  This is a young kid painting a man's butt.
[01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:27.352]  And this is going on somewhere in America.
[01:15:27.412 --> 01:15:28.433]  I did a reverse image search.
[01:15:28.493 --> 01:15:29.854]  I couldn't find any matches for it.
[01:15:30.555 --> 01:15:32.817]  But this is the disgustingness that's going on.
[01:15:33.117 --> 01:15:39.341]  And if you think this is okay, and obviously there's adults here that think this is cool, and there's other kids watching, oh look, he's touching the man's butt with a paintbrush.
[01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:40.602]  This is wrong!
[01:15:40.942 --> 01:15:42.823]  It's wrong on so many levels.
[01:15:43.223 --> 01:15:50.428]  I can't even describe to you how wrong this is, and how you're damaging these children, and it's child abuse at the hundredth level.
[01:15:51.524 --> 01:15:52.524]  It's totally sick.
[01:15:52.524 --> 01:15:55.644]  All right, so Rob Dew in studio with us for another segment.
[01:15:55.644 --> 01:15:59.883]   We've pretty much covered all the latest drag queen story stuff that you need to see, but
[01:15:59.883 --> 01:16:02.883]  the story itself goes on.
[01:16:02.883 --> 01:16:08.563]   What's weird about this, Rob, is that whether it's Savannah Hernandez or Libs of TikTok,
[01:16:08.563 --> 01:16:11.164]  they don't want people seeing what they're doing.
[01:16:11.184 --> 01:16:13.086]  They're the ones doing these drag queen shows.
[01:16:13.126 --> 01:16:14.708]  They're the ones doing these things for kids.
[01:16:15.009 --> 01:16:16.671]  They're the ones uploading the videos to the internet.
[01:16:16.731 --> 01:16:18.092]  They're covering the windows of paper.
[01:16:18.393 --> 01:16:19.954]  All Savannah does is report on it.
[01:16:20.295 --> 01:16:21.837]  All Libs of TikTok does is share it.
[01:16:21.877 --> 01:16:23.298]  There's no original content there.
[01:16:23.358 --> 01:16:26.282]  It's just sharing their content and then they get banned.
[01:16:26.382 --> 01:16:28.484]  It's almost like they know what they're doing is wrong.
[01:16:28.745 --> 01:16:28.905]  Right.
[01:16:28.925 --> 01:16:34.604]   And by banning people and censoring people, they're admitting that what you're doing is
[01:16:34.604 --> 01:16:36.425]  wrong by showing it to people.
[01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:37.604]  And they don't want that.
[01:16:37.604 --> 01:16:40.965]   So Savannah put out a video last night, said learn why this journalist is being banned
[01:16:40.965 --> 01:16:41.965]  from Twitter.
[01:16:41.965 --> 01:16:48.164]   Two of the videos that she was banned from Twitter for were one, she interviews the swimmer
[01:16:48.164 --> 01:16:52.284]   who competed against Leah Thomas, competing against a man, a woman competing against a
[01:16:52.284 --> 01:16:54.725]  man and swimming and oh, she doesn't win.
[01:16:54.786 --> 01:16:55.507]  Oh, what a surprise.
[01:16:55.868 --> 01:17:00.173]  And then the third video just happened last weekend, I guess, at a Gay Pride event.
[01:17:00.594 --> 01:17:01.455]  This naked...
[01:17:02.644 --> 01:17:06.166]  I'm pretty sure it's a man with boobs, or maybe it's a female boobs, I can't really tell.
[01:17:06.646 --> 01:17:11.629]  Exposes her butt to a crowd, and shakes it, twerks for it, and there's kids everywhere.
[01:17:11.929 --> 01:17:13.310]  It's totally disgusting.
[01:17:13.530 --> 01:17:14.451]  That's a picture right there.
[01:17:14.711 --> 01:17:18.293]  This is, by the way, this police officer, I feel so bad for this police officer.
[01:17:18.653 --> 01:17:25.236]  That police officer should have arrested that thing right on sight, and probably given it, fed it a little pavement too.
[01:17:25.396 --> 01:17:26.337]  I mean, that's assault.
[01:17:26.577 --> 01:17:28.718]  You go up to somebody, you rub your ass on them?
[01:17:29.038 --> 01:17:29.899]  That is assault!
[01:17:30.339 --> 01:17:30.979]  It's disgusting.
[01:17:31.019 --> 01:17:31.920]  So I kind of went into it.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:32.780]  This is where it's all going.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:34.560]  Censorship if you speak out against this.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.361]  Hate crime if you speak out against this.
[01:17:36.781 --> 01:17:37.401]  It's all coming down.
[01:17:37.421 --> 01:17:43.163]  So we all have to decide that we're not going to stand for this stuff and all stand up together or we're all going to fall individually.
[01:17:43.203 --> 01:17:44.503]  So here's Savannah's video.
[01:17:44.823 --> 01:17:46.364]  Learn why this journalist was banned from Twitter.
[01:17:46.988 --> 01:17:52.312]  My name is Savannah Hernandez, and I have been baselessly banned from Twitter three times after breaking national news.
[01:17:53.372 --> 01:18:02.759]  In 2020, when I was a 23-year-old journalist with a Twitter following of 122K, former President Donald Trump retweeted my footage of Americans peacefully singing the national anthem.
[01:18:03.259 --> 01:18:11.625]  That retweet resulted in almost 10 million views, and one week later, my entire account, which had never had any prior suspensions or warnings, was permanently deleted.
[01:18:12.205 --> 01:18:19.249]  Twitter didn't immediately tell me why my account was suspended, and one month later they finally emailed saying that I had broken their rule on ban evasion.
[01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:21.431]  However, this was my only account.
[01:18:22.011 --> 01:18:26.014]  I have a podcast, so I decided in 2020 to start a Twitter account for my show.
[01:18:26.554 --> 01:18:29.756]  I then, of course, began using the account to document my on-the-ground reporting.
[01:18:30.356 --> 01:18:39.182]  During the 2022 NCAA Women's Swimming Championships, I interviewed the one athlete that was willing to speak out against Leah Thomas, the transgender athlete that was competing.
[01:18:39.742 --> 01:18:43.788]  This interview went viral garnering almost 3 million views and made Tucker Carlson's show.
[01:18:44.389 --> 01:18:47.914]  Two days later the account was suspended for yet again ban evasion.
[01:18:48.495 --> 01:18:55.705]  I decided to make another account since the original excuse of ban evasion was baseless and no one at Twitter has responded to any of my requests for an appeal.
[01:18:56.346 --> 01:19:02.652]  This morning, my third account was deleted once again after three separate videos I put out this past week made national news.
[01:19:03.253 --> 01:19:08.618]  I went out and I asked black Americans if the economy was really doing as well as Joe Biden has been saying.
[01:19:09.099 --> 01:19:13.563]  I then went to DC Pride and captured a nude trans person twerking in front of kids.
[01:19:14.224 --> 01:19:17.527]  Finally, I interviewed members of the Pride community regarding their pronouns.
[01:19:18.108 --> 01:19:24.734]  Across Twitter, these clips were seen over 4 million times, and when I woke up this morning, my account was once again suspended.
[01:19:25.115 --> 01:19:31.201]  This is the third time that Twitter has silenced me for breaking national news and countering what the mainstream media and government are reporting to us.
[01:19:31.681 --> 01:19:43.049]  I'm an independent reporter that has been on the ground to cover events such as the BLM riots of 2020, the Texas border crisis, the San Francisco fentanyl crisis, homelessness in downtown LA, and even January 6th.
[01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:49.374]  My only goal has been to highlight the issues, voices, and on-the-ground coverage the mainstream media continues to silence and cover up.
[01:19:49.774 --> 01:19:53.657]  And for that, I have been censored, targeted, and effectively deleted from history.
[01:19:53.917 --> 01:19:55.339]  So please help me spread this message.
[01:19:55.719 --> 01:20:06.290]  Because two years, multiple breaking news stories, and three Twitter accounts later, I still have never received an answer as to why I was and continue to be baselessly banned on Twitter's platform.
[01:20:06.730 --> 01:20:09.453]  And of course, we give Savannah Hernandez a platform at Banned.Video.
[01:20:09.473 --> 01:20:12.656]  That's why InfoWars is so important, so that we can give a platform to other people.
[01:20:12.696 --> 01:20:14.318]  But Rob, here's what I take away from this.
[01:20:15.336 --> 01:20:17.217]  They want to be able to abuse children.
[01:20:17.477 --> 01:20:18.957]  They just don't want you to know about it.
[01:20:19.037 --> 01:20:19.217]  Right.
[01:20:19.557 --> 01:20:22.158]  They don't want regular people out there to see what's going on.
[01:20:22.719 --> 01:20:25.339]  And so they hide it behind closed doors.
[01:20:25.399 --> 01:20:27.020]  They hide it behind papered windows.
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:29.121]  They hide it under the guise of tolerance.
[01:20:29.881 --> 01:20:32.382]  And if you don't agree with it, then you're the bad person.
[01:20:32.682 --> 01:20:33.223]  All the sudden.
[01:20:33.443 --> 01:20:35.885]  And there's no debate about whether it's good or not for the community.
[01:20:35.905 --> 01:20:36.705]  They just do it.
[01:20:37.046 --> 01:20:42.770]  The library just goes, we're going to do this because libraries are probably run more often than not by liberal left-leaning people.
[01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:43.971]  And then you want to be tolerant, right?
[01:20:44.251 --> 01:20:45.132]  Let's have these people come in.
[01:20:45.332 --> 01:20:46.433]  They don't do any background checks.
[01:20:46.453 --> 01:20:46.934]  They admit it.
[01:20:47.134 --> 01:20:47.714]  They don't do it.
[01:20:48.535 --> 01:20:51.477]  And so they let these people come in who want to get near kids.
[01:20:51.778 --> 01:20:53.199]  And there's a reason why they want to get near kids.
[01:20:53.219 --> 01:20:56.702]  And I think we've documented it many times over throughout the years.
[01:20:57.711 --> 01:21:08.359]  Yeah, and you can see in some of the videos that we've played just over the years, yeah, they invite the kids, they crawl on them, they rub their bellies, they tell them to shake their butts and bend over and all this weird stuff.
[01:21:08.399 --> 01:21:10.681]  I mean, it's just, it's totally sick stuff.
[01:21:11.341 --> 01:21:13.403]  I mean, that's why it's just total Twilight Zone to me.
[01:21:13.763 --> 01:21:16.285]  It's like, how is this even going on?
[01:21:16.785 --> 01:21:19.767]  And then how are you the bad guy if you say it shouldn't be?
[01:21:21.028 --> 01:21:23.030]  What Twilight Zone episode am I in?
[01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:25.718]  I have no idea.
[01:21:25.738 --> 01:21:31.041]  I have no idea how it got this bad, but since, I guess, Drag Queen Story Hour started in 2015, so seven years.
[01:21:31.061 --> 01:21:31.581]  There you go.
[01:21:32.121 --> 01:21:35.703]  We all need a little bleach to our eyes after this hour.
[01:21:35.783 --> 01:21:36.203]  Yikes.
[01:21:36.263 --> 01:21:37.083]  Here's some more of it.
[01:21:37.203 --> 01:21:40.064]  We'll put a bow on this now, if you can.
[01:21:40.084 --> 01:21:40.945]  A nice gay bow.
[01:21:41.665 --> 01:21:42.445]  Pride and sanity.
[01:21:42.766 --> 01:21:47.507]  Mom forces unwilling child to watch gay festivities as he recoils in horror.
[01:21:47.547 --> 01:21:48.768]  I'm seeing a lot of that, by the way.
[01:21:49.188 --> 01:21:57.933]   And the other thing that I've noticed, too, Rob, Is when you're watching footage of these, uh, you know, these gay parades that have now just turned into sexual deviant parades.
[01:21:58.353 --> 01:22:00.835]  It's gone from gay pride parade to sexual deviant parade.
[01:22:01.295 --> 01:22:05.737]  I noticed that the kids that are in the parade aren't smiling, aren't happy, don't look like they're having fun.
[01:22:06.078 --> 01:22:09.119]  The kids that are in the audience aren't happy, are fighting with their parents.
[01:22:09.139 --> 01:22:10.180]  Their parents are pushing them.
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.382]  I remember some of the things that I used to do as a kid.
[01:22:13.422 --> 01:22:20.288]  We'd have a 4th of July parade, and we'd have puppies, and maybe blow bubbles, and they'd throw candy, and there'd be hula hoops and sparklers.
[01:22:20.648 --> 01:22:22.009]  All the kids had fun!
[01:22:22.409 --> 01:22:26.693]  We'd have local fairs with maybe little carnival rides and carnival games, and guess what?
[01:22:26.933 --> 01:22:28.034]  The kids had fun!
[01:22:28.514 --> 01:22:30.275]  I don't see any kids having fun at this stuff.
[01:22:30.576 --> 01:22:31.516]  They say, oh, it's for kids.
[01:22:31.556 --> 01:22:31.877]  No, it's not.
[01:22:31.917 --> 01:22:32.517]  It's for you!
[01:22:32.537 --> 01:22:34.098]  It's for you, sexual deviants!
[01:22:34.118 --> 01:22:39.523]  It's for you, so you could get close to kids and touch them and rub them, and desensitize them to this type of stuff.
[01:22:40.043 --> 01:22:42.684]  And then they go, oh, I want to be like an adult, so I'm going to repeat it.
[01:22:42.725 --> 01:22:46.406]  Then you got people like Desmond is Amazing running around in strip clubs getting tips.
[01:22:46.767 --> 01:22:48.147]  And there's a kid who doesn't want to watch it.
[01:22:48.187 --> 01:22:50.949]  He look, he's like, leave me alone.
[01:22:50.969 --> 01:22:51.629]  I don't like this.
[01:22:52.029 --> 01:22:56.212]  The kid's having a natural reaction to, hey, this is adult stuff.
[01:22:56.812 --> 01:22:58.674]  That doesn't, kids don't need to be around this.
[01:22:58.815 --> 01:23:00.096]  I don't want to see this crap.
[01:23:00.356 --> 01:23:02.239]  I have an instinct not to want to see this crap.
[01:23:02.379 --> 01:23:03.981]  No, it gets, it's ridiculous.
[01:23:04.101 --> 01:23:08.126]  And there's a picture too of a young, it's a young boy going, ooh, and it's all over the internet.
[01:23:08.146 --> 01:23:14.253]  And there's like this old wrinkly old man who's butt naked in front of him going, eh, you gotta look at my ding dong.
[01:23:14.313 --> 01:23:16.076]  It's just, it's disgusting.
[01:23:16.556 --> 01:23:19.218]  We don't need to be doing this to our children.
[01:23:19.398 --> 01:23:20.259]  We need to stop it.
[01:23:20.539 --> 01:23:21.720]  We need to speak out against it.
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:22.981]  And don't let it happen in your school.
[01:23:23.001 --> 01:23:24.962]  When it's happening in your school, don't just pull your kids out.
[01:23:25.282 --> 01:23:27.764]  Get some other parents and say, hey, do we want this going on?
[01:23:28.305 --> 01:23:29.125]  Panda Dulce.
[01:23:29.225 --> 01:23:35.050]  Panda is a nickname for little kids who have been, they have black eyes and there's a reason from that.
[01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:38.732]  And it's kind of disgusting to even talk about on this show.
[01:23:38.852 --> 01:23:40.033]  No, really, it's so sordid.
[01:23:40.113 --> 01:23:41.554]  It's just, it's really bad.
[01:23:42.555 --> 01:23:50.078]  This whole drag queen performance thing where a group of men outed what was going on at this library, and they're being called hate criminals.
[01:23:50.218 --> 01:23:51.479]  It's not going to end there.
[01:23:51.699 --> 01:23:53.320]  There's that image I'm talking about.
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.220]  It's like, give me some more bleach, man.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.981]  And by the way, holy crap.
[01:23:57.021 --> 01:24:08.546]  I mean, seriously, let's say you had a bunch of strippers, male and female strippers, doing parades, heterosexual pride parades, and they were running around half-naked, grinding on each other, dry-humping the air, dry-humping the ground.
[01:24:08.866 --> 01:24:10.910]  Of course that would be inappropriate for kids!
[01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:12.473]  Of course that's not happening!
[01:24:13.255 --> 01:24:14.116]  It's ridiculous!
[01:24:14.136 --> 01:24:16.901]  Alright, but here's, there's more abuse to this, Rob, actually.
[01:24:16.921 --> 01:24:18.945]  There's actually, there's another side of the abuse here.
[01:24:20.069 --> 01:24:24.553]  Study contradicts transgender narrative, suggests puberty blockers spike youth suicide.
[01:24:24.573 --> 01:24:26.875]  They say, oh no, no, it's good for the kids.
[01:24:26.935 --> 01:24:27.856]  No, it's not at all.
[01:24:27.916 --> 01:24:28.776]  It's bad for them.
[01:24:29.217 --> 01:24:36.563]  New Heritage Foundation study, youth suicide rates are significantly higher in states where puberty blockers, trans drugs are accessible for children.
[01:24:37.003 --> 01:24:39.966]  And then there was another censorship of an account on Twitter.
[01:24:40.707 --> 01:24:49.566]   A 35-year-old detransitioned European man named Richie Who did a breakdown of his own transition, detransition.
[01:24:49.987 --> 01:24:52.348]  No one told me any of what I'm going to tell you now.
[01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:54.110]  It was a long thread on Twitter.
[01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:57.373]  DetransitionMan shares grim details of trans surgeries.
[01:24:57.753 --> 01:24:59.915]  A lot of stuff in there I didn't even know about.
[01:25:00.655 --> 01:25:07.701]  And it's horrific, sad stuff that they promote this lifestyle to kids that's so degenerative and unhealthy.
[01:25:08.101 --> 01:25:09.122]  Let kids be kids.
[01:25:09.502 --> 01:25:10.583]  Let's let them be kids.
[01:25:10.723 --> 01:25:11.504]  They don't need to grow up.
[01:25:11.524 --> 01:25:15.067]  Let them play in the park and play ball and climb on jungle gyms.
[01:25:15.287 --> 01:25:19.412]  There's a time when kids need to grow up, and that's when they're young adults.
[01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:30.704]  These are young kids, and they're putting them into a process where they're being groomed, without a doubt, to accept grown men in makeup touching them.
[01:25:31.024 --> 01:25:31.685]  That's where it is.
[01:25:32.025 --> 01:25:33.187]  And it's going to get worse from there.
[01:25:33.627 --> 01:25:36.611]  And if you don't speak out against it, your kids are going to be next.
[01:25:36.651 --> 01:25:37.972]  So you've been warned.
[01:25:38.353 --> 01:25:41.376]  I hate to do this, but it needs to be said.
[01:25:41.396 --> 01:25:42.377]  It needs to be shown.
[01:25:42.638 --> 01:25:44.440]  People need to know what's really going on.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:47.604]  And so you're informed when they go, oh, we're just having fun.
[01:25:47.884 --> 01:25:49.426]  No, they're not having fun.
[01:25:50.187 --> 01:25:50.988]  That's not fun.
[01:25:52.401 --> 01:25:53.322]  That's degenerate.
[01:25:53.802 --> 01:26:02.649]  And by the way, it's well known as a characteristic of potential serial killers that they'll abuse and torture animals, just like the Yuvalde shooter was killing cats.
[01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:04.891]  This is the same thing for sex, folks.
[01:26:05.411 --> 01:26:21.704]  If they can get kids to be desensitized and programmed into this sexual deviancy at a young age, they'll be more inclined to be deviants and perverts at the next age so that the rest of these freaks will feel like they're just blending in as they're grooming the next generation of degenerate perverts.
[01:26:22.344 --> 01:26:24.644]  So this Patriot Front story is a weird thing.
[01:26:25.425 --> 01:26:28.405]  And Rob Dew and I were just kind of discussing some of the oddities.
[01:26:28.605 --> 01:26:30.746]  But folks, this is the latest oddity.
[01:26:31.086 --> 01:26:35.966]  We know about FBI running events like the Michigan plot to kidnap the governor.
[01:26:36.046 --> 01:26:37.987]  That was all FBI run, FBI led.
[01:26:38.347 --> 01:26:39.487]  That all came out in court.
[01:26:40.187 --> 01:26:43.688]  Same FBI agent that ran that was running the January 6th events as well.
[01:26:43.728 --> 01:26:44.848]  That's not a coincidence, folks.
[01:26:44.988 --> 01:26:46.588]  So same story there, most likely.
[01:26:47.228 --> 01:26:49.909]  And now maybe we have the same thing happening here.
[01:26:50.589 --> 01:26:51.950]  With the Patriot Front.
[01:26:51.970 --> 01:26:53.872]  I want to play this clip and get Rob Deuce's take.
[01:26:54.992 --> 01:27:02.598]  Why does one police say they have informants embedded in the Patriot Front and then the police chief running the press conference deny that?
[01:27:02.478 --> 01:27:09.478]  Here that is in clip eight.
[01:27:09.478 --> 01:27:11.677]  to follow up on the question I've answered.
[01:27:11.687 --> 01:27:12.648]  Are you with the media, sir?
[01:27:13.008 --> 01:27:13.328]  I'm not.
[01:27:13.388 --> 01:27:14.108]  I'm a citizen.
[01:27:14.288 --> 01:27:16.689]  Okay, I'm going to ask the media questions.
[01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:26.813]  The police chief was taking questions today at a press conference in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and he was blindsided by a citizen journalist sitting amongst the corporate press.
[01:27:26.833 --> 01:27:38.092]   There was an officer of yours that was filmed stating that there was information in embedded feds or informants No, I think you're completely mistaken.
[01:27:38.112 --> 01:27:39.113]  I think you're completely mistaken.
[01:27:39.133 --> 01:27:40.094]  You didn't say it was wrong.
[01:27:40.114 --> 01:27:43.417]  Do you know what the original stop was for?
[01:27:43.257 --> 01:27:46.537]  No, I think you're completely mistaken.
[01:27:46.537 --> 01:27:47.537]  I think you're completely mistaken.
[01:27:47.537 --> 01:27:48.537]  Well, I mean, you didn't say it was wrong.
[01:27:48.537 --> 01:27:52.577]  Do you know what the original stop was for?
[01:27:52.577 --> 01:27:53.577]  For that.
[01:27:53.577 --> 01:27:54.577]  But how did you know?
[01:27:54.577 --> 01:27:55.577]  How did you know that they- Nice.
[01:27:55.577 --> 01:27:56.577]  Yep, you guys didn't get it.
[01:27:56.577 --> 01:27:57.577]  There's somebody inside that group that's following us.
[01:27:57.577 --> 01:27:58.577]  There's somebody inside that group that's following us.
[01:27:58.577 --> 01:28:10.017]   These were not Antifa in disguise, nor were they FBI members in disguise.
[01:28:09.998 --> 01:28:17.741]  You're making this statement one way, and this video isn't something that has been ginned up in some conspiracy matter.
[01:28:17.781 --> 01:28:21.022]  It's actually someone who videoed an officer of yours on the scene.
[01:28:21.122 --> 01:28:21.562]  Hang on.
[01:28:21.642 --> 01:28:25.984]  Since this is a press conference, I'm going to ask you to be quiet, and I'm going to answer questions from the press at this point.
[01:28:26.444 --> 01:28:28.906]  Ooh, back to the corporate narrative questions.
[01:28:29.466 --> 01:28:29.807]  All right.
[01:28:29.907 --> 01:28:30.387]  So there you go.
[01:28:30.407 --> 01:28:33.329]  The rest is from Ivory Hecker there, independent journalist.
[01:28:33.369 --> 01:28:38.953]  But I mean, Rob, I haven't been covering this because it just it seems like it's a forced thing.
[01:28:39.073 --> 01:28:42.656]  I don't know anyone from the group, no traces of origin, no traces of leadership.
[01:28:42.716 --> 01:28:43.757]  Nobody's ever reached out to me.
[01:28:43.777 --> 01:28:44.777]  The whole thing seems weird.
[01:28:45.017 --> 01:28:46.979]  The Lincoln, the Lincoln project involvement.
[01:28:47.279 --> 01:28:48.720]  They magically show up at these events.
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:49.741]  They're riding around in U-Hauls.
[01:28:49.781 --> 01:28:51.623]  They all have uniforms covering their faces.
[01:28:52.043 --> 01:28:52.904]  All very sketchy.
[01:28:53.244 --> 01:28:55.626]  And then this... They all kind of look like the same build, too.
[01:28:55.686 --> 01:28:57.208]  There's not a fat guy in the bunch.
[01:28:57.388 --> 01:28:58.469]  And then this, though, Rob.
[01:28:58.569 --> 01:28:59.470]  So what do you make of that?
[01:28:59.490 --> 01:29:03.473]  The police chief, oh, we don't have informants, after the police officer on the scene says, we have informants.
[01:29:03.513 --> 01:29:07.278]  Well, you could tell by that big smile and that look to the left he does.
[01:29:07.738 --> 01:29:09.380]  Well, he's like, oh, oh, crap.
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:10.181]  What just happened?
[01:29:10.221 --> 01:29:11.042]  Somebody just who?
[01:29:11.303 --> 01:29:13.085]  He's probably thinking, what officer said that?
[01:29:13.325 --> 01:29:13.726]  There's one.
[01:29:13.846 --> 01:29:16.729]  There's that one Patriot officer on there that brought it up.
[01:29:17.110 --> 01:29:19.553]  And we got to find out who he is and root him out of the department.
[01:29:19.753 --> 01:29:20.594]  Because that's the other thing.
[01:29:20.634 --> 01:29:21.875]  We've got to federalize the police.
[01:29:21.915 --> 01:29:23.936]  They want the police to take federal control.
[01:29:24.256 --> 01:29:31.722]  And this is another way of doing that, is by getting them to work with the feds in different operations, either embedded in this thing, or maybe there are feds in there.
[01:29:32.002 --> 01:29:35.225]  He said there's no FBI, but he did say, I think you're mistaken.
[01:29:35.265 --> 01:29:37.386]  He didn't say you're wrong, that we had informants in there.
[01:29:37.406 --> 01:29:38.447]  He said, I think you're mistaken.
[01:29:38.627 --> 01:29:43.151]  I think we can all say in complete confidence that there is at least one informant in that group.
[01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:45.293]  Now here's another aspect of this.
[01:29:46.033 --> 01:29:47.834]  So that we can keep ourselves grounded here.
[01:29:48.315 --> 01:29:51.017]  Another problem we have in this country is yes-men.
[01:29:51.597 --> 01:29:52.218]  Yes-men.
[01:29:52.698 --> 01:30:07.349]  So, you might have a police chief that might not even be politically motivated, but he gets calls from up higher, federal government or something, police association, calls from on the high saying, hey, we're gonna put embeds into this group, and they're gonna be communicating with you.
[01:30:07.710 --> 01:30:09.691]  Don't tell anyone that that's what's going on.
[01:30:10.011 --> 01:30:12.673]  So then, oh, he just does it because he's a yes-man.
[01:30:13.174 --> 01:30:13.974]  So then what happens?
[01:30:15.322 --> 01:30:16.423]  Who's really running a show?
[01:30:16.463 --> 01:30:17.564]  Who's organizing this?
[01:30:17.604 --> 01:30:18.784]  Who's renting the U-Hauls?
[01:30:19.005 --> 01:30:20.366]  Who's giving them their uniforms?
[01:30:20.486 --> 01:30:21.486]  Is that the informant?
[01:30:21.586 --> 01:30:22.387]  Is that the feds?
[01:30:22.747 --> 01:30:27.751]  Or is someone else sourcing the monies for these purchases and rentals?
[01:30:28.191 --> 01:30:29.452]  These are the questions that need to be asked.
[01:30:29.492 --> 01:30:33.875]  But Rob, you made a point of, how come they don't ever show their faces, including after the arrest?
[01:30:33.915 --> 01:30:34.996]  How come nobody's showing their face?
[01:30:35.276 --> 01:30:37.178]  Well, because they have to keep these people hidden.
[01:30:38.239 --> 01:30:38.839]  And it's like this.
[01:30:38.879 --> 01:30:42.002]  I go back to this little tweet from Representative Stubbe.
[01:30:42.142 --> 01:30:44.164]  He's showing a picture of a hit the streets.
[01:30:44.284 --> 01:30:45.145]  You said you'd riot.
[01:30:45.485 --> 01:30:45.966]  A D.C.
[01:30:45.986 --> 01:30:46.586]  call to action.
[01:30:46.606 --> 01:30:47.828]  Says call to action right there.
[01:30:47.848 --> 01:30:49.089]  There's nothing implied.
[01:30:49.429 --> 01:30:50.030]  Call to action.
[01:30:50.150 --> 01:30:51.091]  You said you'd riot.
[01:30:51.531 --> 01:30:54.694]  We're going to hit the streets if we don't like the Roe versus Wade decision.
[01:30:56.363 --> 01:31:01.906]  You know, anybody who goes up and shows up at a Drag Queen story hour and says anything is going to be investigated for a hate crime actively.
[01:31:02.066 --> 01:31:03.247]  Or an American flag.
[01:31:03.347 --> 01:31:04.067]  Or if you're an American flag.
[01:31:04.207 --> 01:31:06.188]  There's a group called Shut Down D.C.
[01:31:06.248 --> 01:31:07.008]  running around D.C.
[01:31:07.069 --> 01:31:11.651]  right now raging with lawyers and bondsmen in case they get arrested because they're planning on committing crimes.
[01:31:11.671 --> 01:31:13.012]  But they're allowed to commit crimes.
[01:31:13.112 --> 01:31:13.632]  Nobody else is.
[01:31:13.832 --> 01:31:16.053]  What's going on with James Brown and drag?
[01:31:16.613 --> 01:31:16.974]  A.K.A.
[01:31:17.014 --> 01:31:17.834]  Maxine Waters.
[01:31:18.734 --> 01:31:19.335]  What's she got?
[01:31:20.779 --> 01:31:28.763]  Folks, there was a clip of her standing behind Nancy Pelosi who was delivering a speech, I think it was yesterday or this weekend.
[01:31:29.884 --> 01:31:32.625]  Maxine Waters doesn't blink for like 30 seconds.
[01:31:33.026 --> 01:31:34.146]  What is that?
[01:31:34.646 --> 01:31:36.127]  What is going on with that freak?
[01:31:37.228 --> 01:31:39.369]  What demon has possessed Maxine Waters?
[01:31:42.331 --> 01:31:42.431]  Or...
[01:31:43.687 --> 01:31:55.734]  Or perhaps Maxine Waters is just so focused, James Brown in drag, Maxine Waters is just so focused because she just took a packet of Turbo Force from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:31:59.135 --> 01:32:01.376]  It is known to give you 10 hours of energy, folks.
[01:32:01.637 --> 01:32:11.499]   She may have done a packet of Turbo Force from InfoWarsStore.com and then she may have also done a couple droppers of the
[01:32:11.499 --> 01:32:16.189]   brain force ultra and so she just had stupendous focus there she didn't even
[01:32:16.189 --> 01:32:19.779]   blink for hours maxine waters unbelievable stuff there
[01:32:19.779 --> 01:32:24.980]   uh... what a freak what an absolute psycho what a what a criminal maniac
[01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:29.100]   maxine waters is but uh... the focus
[01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:33.619]   that she got from brain force ultra and turbo forces obviously no jokes
[01:32:33.831 --> 01:32:36.853]  So if it works for Maxine Waters, it will certainly work for you.
[01:32:37.374 --> 01:32:40.076]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:40.096 --> 01:33:00.589]   But folks, as I've got more news in front of me, economic news that I'm about to get into here, when you're hearing all the bad news and you're seeing where the country is going under Joe Biden, just remember when you're thinking to yourself, What can I do?

[01:33:17.192 --> 01:33:19.513]  The Democrats would love to see that happen if they get their way.
[01:33:20.013 --> 01:33:23.833]  So we have launched preparetoday.com, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:34:04.662 --> 01:34:06.784]  I want people to see.

[01:34:44.839 --> 01:34:46.581]  By the way, I have 3 of these in my house.

[01:34:51.787 --> 01:34:54.590]  And look at that after 3 months.
[01:34:54.610 --> 01:34:55.170]  I don't smoke.
[01:34:55.911 --> 01:34:57.053]  No smokers inside either.
[01:34:57.594 --> 01:35:00.458]  So that's for eight months right there.
[01:35:00.938 --> 01:35:07.027]  And I don't even know if you can really see how black the used one is on the right compared to the clean one on the left.
[01:35:07.087 --> 01:35:08.609]  So, folks, let me tell you.
[01:35:09.610 --> 01:35:10.392]  The studies are out.
[01:35:11.293 --> 01:35:12.655]  Your home has polluted air in it.
[01:35:14.304 --> 01:35:15.565]  Sucks, but that's the case.
[01:35:16.065 --> 01:35:19.327]  That's why we sell air filtration systems at infowarstore.com.
[01:35:19.588 --> 01:35:21.629]  The filter's available at preparedtoday.com.
[01:35:22.089 --> 01:35:36.079]  I'm telling you, man, again, from somebody, nobody's smoking in my house, non-smoking house, I live alone, no pets, and you just saw all the impurities removed from my air in eight months.
[01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:39.405]  So it's usually about six to eight months on those filters.
[01:35:39.805 --> 01:35:42.066]  I extended mine out to eight, and you saw what it looked like.
[01:35:42.326 --> 01:35:43.287]  Folks, that's no joke.
[01:35:43.587 --> 01:35:45.368]  Get an air filtration system for your home.
[01:35:46.048 --> 01:35:48.949]  I didn't breathe in that crap for eight months.
[01:35:49.570 --> 01:35:56.713]  I didn't have to breathe in that crap because my Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system filtered that out of the air in my house.
[01:35:56.833 --> 01:35:59.514]  Cannot recommend that enough, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:59.574 --> 01:36:03.476]  So, preparetoday.com, infowarstore.com is where all of this is available.
[01:36:04.312 --> 01:36:08.973]  And of course, it's your support at InfoWarsTore.com that makes all of it possible.
[01:36:10.653 --> 01:36:12.414]  Okay, let's do this quickly.
[01:36:13.854 --> 01:36:14.834]  Let's do this quickly.
[01:36:16.034 --> 01:36:20.795]  Chris Coons was on with Brett Baer, and this guy's just incredible.
[01:36:21.535 --> 01:36:23.976]  Chris Coons, supposedly a moderate Democrat.
[01:36:24.036 --> 01:36:24.776]  Give me a break.
[01:36:25.936 --> 01:36:37.872]   Here's Chris Coons when asked about how come Liberals get to protest and riot and do whatever the hell they want, engage in violence, but January 6th is the big crime.
[01:36:38.593 --> 01:36:42.879]  Here's Senator Coons responding to that in clip 14.
[01:36:44.028 --> 01:36:51.618]  Senator, we're getting ready for this ruling, and it's going to be controversial no matter what happens, if it matches the draft, the leaked draft opinion or not.
[01:36:52.018 --> 01:36:54.341]  There is this law on the books.
[01:36:54.781 --> 01:36:57.184]  I'm just asking, should they follow the law?
[01:36:57.285 --> 01:37:01.330]  Should the Attorney General say, yes, arrest those people before something happens?
[01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:16.550]  Well, Brad, I think if the leaked version of the opinion is matched by what would be a remarkable act of judicial activism, conservative judicial activism, there will be understandable anger across the nation.
[01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:20.852]  As an elected official, I've certainly had protests out front of my house.
[01:37:21.132 --> 01:37:21.492]  Really?
[01:37:21.612 --> 01:37:24.574]  Many of us have, who serve in Congress or in other elected offices.
[01:37:25.534 --> 01:37:34.376]  But we need to make sure that all appropriate actions are being taken to ensure the safety of members of our federal judiciary, including Supreme Court justice.
[01:37:35.556 --> 01:37:41.078]  And by the way, they lie, like AOC said, all the Republicans voted down the security.
[01:37:41.638 --> 01:37:43.138]  No, Democrats did too, actually.
[01:37:43.278 --> 01:37:46.059]  I think 27 of them, including herself.
[01:37:47.110 --> 01:37:49.991]  But did they say, oh, only Republicans didn't vote for the security?
[01:37:50.111 --> 01:37:51.171]  No, it was Democrats.
[01:37:51.651 --> 01:37:55.732]  But Chris Coons says that he's had protests outside of his house.
[01:37:55.892 --> 01:37:56.172]  Really?
[01:37:56.812 --> 01:37:57.452]  You ever heard about that?
[01:37:57.472 --> 01:37:58.573]  I wonder if that's true.
[01:37:58.853 --> 01:37:59.413]  I think he lied.
[01:37:59.733 --> 01:38:00.493]  I'd like to see some proof.
[01:38:01.033 --> 01:38:01.853]  Wouldn't be surprised if he lied.
[01:38:01.873 --> 01:38:02.713]  He's a Democrat, after all.
[01:38:03.454 --> 01:38:06.274]  And they say, oh, conservative activism from the bench.
[01:38:06.614 --> 01:38:08.835]  Folks, all Democrats are activists.
[01:38:08.955 --> 01:38:11.575]  What does that mean, conservative activism from the bench?
[01:38:11.976 --> 01:38:13.216]  Because you don't get your way?
[01:38:14.161 --> 01:38:18.244]  Because you can't kill babies, which in your state, Chris Coons, probably you still will be able to?
[01:38:18.264 --> 01:38:21.267]  I mean, just what an unmitigated liar.
[01:38:23.513 --> 01:38:24.894]  Conservative activists on the bench.
[01:38:25.034 --> 01:38:34.559]  Every, every leftist, democrat, liberal is an activist and puts their agenda over reality and common sense and the Constitution, Bill of Rights every day.
[01:38:34.839 --> 01:38:42.764]  Conservative activist judges giving the decision back to the states, saying we, really ridding their hands of the situation, saying we're not going to be involved in abortion anymore.
[01:38:43.244 --> 01:38:44.084]  States can take care of that.
[01:38:44.344 --> 01:38:45.665]  That's conservative activism.
[01:38:46.406 --> 01:38:47.986]  But Chris Coons doesn't stop there.
[01:38:48.447 --> 01:38:54.374]   He directly is asked about what about Chuck Schumer's statement, did that lead to some of this violence?
[01:38:54.394 --> 01:38:55.795]  Here is Chris Coons response in clip 15.
[01:38:57.195 --> 01:39:07.700]  A lot has been made this week about words, how much they matter, how much stirring the pot, giving the green light to violence in any way, shape, or form is unacceptable.
[01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:08.420]  Take a listen to this.
[01:39:11.793 --> 01:39:21.383]  I want to tell you, Borsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price.
[01:39:22.624 --> 01:39:27.569]  You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.
[01:39:28.150 --> 01:39:31.233]  On the steps of the Supreme Court, do those words qualify, Senator?
[01:39:33.607 --> 01:39:34.908]  So here's a key distinction.
[01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:49.500]  What Senator Schumer was saying was that he was upset, he was alarmed, he was concerned at the prospect that justices would reverse decades of a well-established fundamental constitutional right in our country.
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:50.841]  No, that's not true.
[01:39:50.901 --> 01:39:53.303]  What he did not say was, let's go attack them.
[01:39:54.619 --> 01:39:56.920]  There is no constitutional right, so that's a lie.
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:39:59.781]  But Chris Coons says, oh, there's a key distinction.
[01:40:00.102 --> 01:40:01.402]  Yeah, we know the key distinction.
[01:40:01.642 --> 01:40:04.664]  Schumer's a Democrat, Schumer's a liberal, so he's above the law.
[01:40:04.784 --> 01:40:05.404]  We get it.
[01:40:06.485 --> 01:40:07.625]  That's the key distinction.
[01:40:08.966 --> 01:40:11.067]  If it was a Republican that said something like that...
[01:40:11.997 --> 01:40:14.979]  And then activists went in front of liberal justices' houses.
[01:40:15.159 --> 01:40:18.641]  You know damn well they'd blame that Republican, just like they try to blame Trump for everything.
[01:40:19.222 --> 01:40:21.623]  But, oh, there's a key distinction, says Chris Coons.
[01:40:21.683 --> 01:40:22.184]  We know.
[01:40:22.504 --> 01:40:23.885]  Democrat-liberal privilege.
[01:40:24.165 --> 01:40:25.506]  You guys are above the law.
[01:40:26.066 --> 01:40:30.369]  You guys get to riot and murder and cheat and steal and lie.
[01:40:30.710 --> 01:40:31.950]  You get to do that.
[01:40:32.110 --> 01:40:32.951]  No one else does.
[01:40:33.051 --> 01:40:34.552]  No one else wants to, but you anyway.
[01:40:35.012 --> 01:40:41.757]  And right now in D.C., they've got multiple groups, violent groups, ready to riot and rage if they can't kill their kid, their babies.
[01:40:42.197 --> 01:40:47.861]  All right, let me get into this big stack of vaccine health news that we have going on here, and it's a big one.
[01:40:49.823 --> 01:40:55.206]  This is part one from the conservative woman Paula Jardine.
[01:40:55.887 --> 01:41:00.990]  Vaccine was on the way before COVID was confirmed.
[01:41:01.651 --> 01:41:03.973]  Vaccine was on the way before COVID was confirmed.
[01:41:04.013 --> 01:41:06.715]  In fact, guys, I don't know what's going on.
[01:41:06.775 --> 01:41:08.916]  I sent a bunch of stuff on Twitter to be printed.
[01:41:08.956 --> 01:41:09.597]  I never got it.
[01:41:10.237 --> 01:41:23.973]   But part Of the thing in this story is, when they first signed the contracts to produce the COVID vaccines, only 18 people had been diagnosed with COVID.
[01:41:24.894 --> 01:41:23.973]  18!
[01:41:25.054 --> 01:41:26.795]  And they were all in China.
[01:41:28.536 --> 01:41:38.343]  And somehow, and that was in January, and somehow with that, they were able to sign billion-dollar vaccine deals for billions of vaccines.
[01:41:39.704 --> 01:41:40.745]  Just incredible stuff.
[01:41:40.805 --> 01:41:45.069]  And this is just part one of Paula Jardine's breakdown here.
[01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:46.110]  More is coming.
[01:41:46.210 --> 01:41:48.132]  It just shows how the whole thing was planned.
[01:41:48.532 --> 01:41:49.633]  The whole thing was scripted.
[01:41:49.773 --> 01:41:50.654]  We were lied to.
[01:41:50.734 --> 01:41:51.495]  We were used.
[01:41:51.595 --> 01:41:52.435]  We were abused.
[01:41:53.837 --> 01:41:58.081]  And it's a massive criminal enterprise, this COVID-19 vaccine and COVID itself.
[01:41:59.209 --> 01:42:02.050]  That sadly won't be addressed, I'm afraid.
[01:42:02.911 --> 01:42:07.512]  And of course, we blew this story out of the water on Monday with Mike Adams in studio.
[01:42:07.332 --> 01:42:09.332]  Global Medical Bombshell.
[01:42:09.332 --> 01:42:14.332]   Scientists prove COVID vaccine causes blood clots live on air.
[01:42:14.332 --> 01:42:19.332]   Watch Doctor Shocked by epidemic of mysterious clots found in suddenly deceased vaccinated adults.
[01:42:19.332 --> 01:42:22.332]   Nothing like this has ever been pulled out of the human body.
[01:42:22.332 --> 01:42:25.332]  And it's only happening in vaccinated individuals.
[01:42:25.332 --> 01:42:29.332]  And so, I'm not saying this to scare anybody.
[01:42:29.274 --> 01:42:32.635]  I'm not saying this to, you know, tell you to panic.
[01:42:32.915 --> 01:42:34.035]  That's what's going on.
[01:42:34.135 --> 01:42:43.358]  Now, if you've taken a vaccine and you obviously have some emotions in response to this, you know, maybe there's some help for you out there.
[01:42:43.798 --> 01:42:45.479]  But that's what's going on.
[01:42:45.799 --> 01:42:48.120]  And now they want to give these kids vaccines too.
[01:42:49.842 --> 01:42:54.464]  But yeah, mortician finds massive hand-sized clots in cadavers after vax release.
[01:42:54.564 --> 01:42:55.824]  It's just, it's never been seen before.
[01:42:55.864 --> 01:42:56.985]  It's all the vaccinated people.
[01:42:57.965 --> 01:43:03.307]  And then, you know, you'll never know with this stuff, sadly, because you're not allowed to know.
[01:43:04.227 --> 01:43:04.487]  U.S.
[01:43:04.567 --> 01:43:09.069]  Representative Sean Kasten's 17-year-old daughter dies unexpectedly.
[01:43:09.369 --> 01:43:10.970]  It's another sudden adult death syndrome.
[01:43:11.786 --> 01:43:14.448]  And of course they're saying, you know, respect the family's privacy.
[01:43:14.468 --> 01:43:17.151]  We're not answering any questions or any details about the death.
[01:43:17.771 --> 01:43:20.794]  But healthy young girl, 17 years old.
[01:43:21.795 --> 01:43:23.256]  Can we ask if she was vaccinated?
[01:43:23.317 --> 01:43:23.757]  Is that allowed?
[01:43:24.157 --> 01:43:29.542]  There was this big fitness guru named, I believe his name was Matthew Murray McDonald, I think was his name.
[01:43:29.582 --> 01:43:33.526]  Matthew Murray McDonald, 27 years old, great health, heart failure.
[01:43:34.946 --> 01:43:36.347]  Not allowed to ask if it's the vaccine.
[01:43:36.768 --> 01:43:39.971]  The Biebers, Justin Bieber and his wife, Hailey.
[01:43:40.612 --> 01:43:40.972]  Both!
[01:43:41.493 --> 01:43:48.520]  Hailey has severe blood clots and now Justin Bieber can't perform anymore because he has Bell's Palsy.
[01:43:49.641 --> 01:43:52.004]  Or a different variation of Bell's Palsy, I forget the name of it.
[01:43:53.732 --> 01:43:57.134]  So he can't perform anymore because he has a facial paralysis.
[01:43:57.475 --> 01:43:58.936]  Both of them have been vaccinated.
[01:43:58.996 --> 01:44:24.680]   Now, the rumor is, and of course there's no way of confirming this, the rumor is both of them suspect it was from the vaccine, Bieber especially, but he was told by his Basically, his handlers at the label company, the record label company, that if he says anything about the vaccine or side effects or it causing his facial paralysis, they'll drop him from the label.
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:25.621]  Now, those are rumors.
[01:44:25.761 --> 01:44:26.662]  Who knows if that's true?
[01:44:27.683 --> 01:44:30.966]  But it's odd how he just says, oh, my face is paralyzed.
[01:44:31.227 --> 01:44:32.528]  I might not be able to perform again.
[01:44:33.108 --> 01:44:35.251]  He's been vaccinated, the Canadian Justin Bieber.
[01:44:36.111 --> 01:44:37.373]  And now they want to give it to kids.
[01:44:38.701 --> 01:44:47.248]  FDA advisors unanimously recommend Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for ages 6 to 17, despite data showing high risks of heart inflammation.
[01:44:47.708 --> 01:44:49.330]  And why would you even get the vaccine?
[01:44:49.770 --> 01:44:51.071]  What does the vaccine even do to you?
[01:44:51.611 --> 01:44:52.952]  It doesn't protect you from COVID.
[01:44:52.972 --> 01:44:54.994]  It doesn't protect you from getting COVID or spreading COVID.
[01:44:55.374 --> 01:44:58.136]  You don't have any more or less rights after you get the vaccine.
[01:44:58.477 --> 01:44:59.738]  All you have is the side effects.
[01:44:59.778 --> 01:45:00.318]  That's it!
[01:45:00.638 --> 01:45:04.301]  There is not a single positive that comes from the COVID vaccine.
[01:45:04.602 --> 01:45:04.902]  Nothing!
[01:45:08.203 --> 01:45:12.006]  What are they doing on this story from Reuters?
[01:45:14.188 --> 01:45:17.211]  The headline has been changed so much I can't even get my head around it.
[01:45:17.571 --> 01:45:24.298]  The first headline, Moderna COVID vaccine may pose higher heart inflammation risk in the United States.
[01:45:25.058 --> 01:45:33.966]   And then the second headline, USA FDA advisers weigh Moderna vaccine Heart risk for young men.
[01:45:34.547 --> 01:45:44.275]  And then the final edit of the headline is, US FDA advisors overwhelmingly back Moderna COVID vaccine for ages 16 to 17.
[01:45:44.335 --> 01:45:49.039]  So first headline was, pose high heart inflammation risk.
[01:45:49.479 --> 01:45:52.161]  Second headline was, could be heart inflammation risk.
[01:45:52.762 --> 01:45:57.726]  The headline they finally landed on is, highly recommended by FDA.
[01:45:58.789 --> 01:46:01.772]  And we went back in the Wayback Machine and found all the different variations.
[01:46:01.812 --> 01:46:03.374]  Same story from Reuters.
[01:46:03.594 --> 01:46:13.744]  Same story, three different headlines, but the story is about how it's a risk to take the vaccine and it causes heart inflammation, but they didn't want that in the headline because that's all most people see.
[01:46:14.845 --> 01:46:17.248]  So, oh, the headline saying the vaccine is risky?
[01:46:17.308 --> 01:46:17.888]  Get rid of that.
[01:46:18.409 --> 01:46:19.390]  Say how great it is.
[01:46:19.470 --> 01:46:21.332]  Tell us how great the government says it is.
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:24.181]  This is all about money.
[01:46:24.261 --> 01:46:25.562]  You will burn in hell for eternity.
[01:46:25.622 --> 01:46:30.565]  Speakers lambasted FDA advisors during advisory committee hearing.
[01:46:31.366 --> 01:46:34.328]  The video is there at the Gateway Pundit.
[01:46:34.768 --> 01:46:38.291]  Yeah, people are waking up quickly to what is really going on in this planet.
[01:46:38.311 --> 01:46:47.238]  People are waking up quickly to the war that's been waged against them since the day they were born by our corporate world government establishment looking to cement itself right now.
[01:46:47.978 --> 01:46:51.980]  Taking its mask off, showing you what it really is, who it really is.
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:57.502]  Canada makes three jabs, the new fully vaccinated standard, saying two doses doesn't work anymore.
[01:46:57.782 --> 01:46:59.103]  Oh, is that because Trudeau got sick?
[01:46:59.443 --> 01:47:02.945]  Jabbed and boosted Trudeau, sick again with COVID.
[01:47:03.365 --> 01:47:05.606]  Says, oh thank God I was jabbed, of course.
[01:47:06.586 --> 01:47:07.567]  It worked so well for you.
[01:47:09.005 --> 01:47:11.566]  UK Health Agency, now monkeypox is their big thing.
[01:47:12.306 --> 01:47:16.008]  UK Health Agency, 99% of monkeypox cases are gay men.
[01:47:16.588 --> 01:47:19.929]  Oh, so COVID is so bad, 99.9% survivability.
[01:47:20.190 --> 01:47:23.451]  I think monkeypox is like a 91 or something percent survivability.
[01:47:24.582 --> 01:47:31.966]  But, oh, COVID-99 and they say, you have to wear a mask, you have to take a vaccine, don't leave your house, go through all these measures, the plexiglass, wear gloves, all of it.
[01:47:32.666 --> 01:47:35.288]  But then, monkey pox, okay, we pretty much know how you're getting it.
[01:47:35.948 --> 01:47:38.429]  Gay sex, we pretty much know how you're getting it.
[01:47:38.810 --> 01:47:40.771]  Sodomite, sodomy.
[01:47:41.491 --> 01:47:42.972]  But are they telling people not to have sex?
[01:47:43.012 --> 01:47:44.413]  Are they telling people not to have anal sex?
[01:47:44.433 --> 01:47:46.954]  Are they telling gay people not to sodomize one another?
[01:47:47.134 --> 01:47:49.035]  No, because that would be bigoted.
[01:47:50.076 --> 01:47:51.897]  So you see, it's not logic.
[01:47:52.711 --> 01:47:55.532]  If it can't be applied universally, it's propaganda.
[01:47:56.633 --> 01:48:02.316]  So it was never logic with COVID anyway, but that same logic can't be applied to monkeypox because it's all propaganda.
[01:48:02.776 --> 01:48:08.359]  The World Health Organization goes woke with an effort to rename monkeypox virus to avoid being racist and discriminatory.
[01:48:08.699 --> 01:48:10.400]  Yeah, all the gay men are getting it.
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:14.862]  Hey, go have gay sex and don't even worry, we won't call it monkeypox anymore because that's racist.
[01:48:15.762 --> 01:48:16.963]  Yes, the virus is racist.
[01:48:18.297 --> 01:48:22.518]  Did white people not evolve from monkeys, or are we abandoning that lie already?
[01:48:23.018 --> 01:48:27.259]  China flips out over World Health Organization saying lab leak theory needs further study.
[01:48:27.419 --> 01:48:27.779]  Uh-oh!
[01:48:29.279 --> 01:48:30.039]  They don't like that.
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:34.840]  New study finds many children unable to say their own name due to impact of lockdown.
[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:47.103]  Yeah, as if the high school graduation rates weren't low enough, as if the literacy rates weren't low enough, as if the GPAs weren't low enough, now they're going to be even lower thanks to the response to COVID, the lockdowns.
[01:48:49.322 --> 01:48:51.745]  And then tell me, do you think Fauci knows anything about this?
[01:48:51.785 --> 01:48:52.807]  This is right up his alley.
[01:48:53.187 --> 01:49:02.519]  Distressing undercover footage shows beagle puppies whimpering in pain and monkeys in neck restraints as they are force-fed at US testing lab.
[01:49:03.773 --> 01:49:06.996]  Fauci is real famous for torturing and killing animals, actually.
[01:49:07.436 --> 01:49:09.238]  I wonder if he knows anything about this.
[01:49:09.278 --> 01:49:13.562]  Yes, Fauci, the guy that tortures and kills animals, that tells you how much he loves you.
[01:49:14.382 --> 01:49:18.045]  You know most psychotic serial killers start by killing animals, right?
[01:49:18.646 --> 01:49:21.388]  But I'm sure that has nothing to do with Anthony Fauci, right?
[01:49:21.668 --> 01:49:21.829]  No.
[01:49:21.869 --> 01:49:24.531]  All right, still plenty of news to cover here.
[01:49:26.813 --> 01:49:30.816]  Quick programming note, Kate Daly hosting the fourth hour today.
[01:49:30.836 --> 01:49:31.237]  I'll be back.
[01:49:32.276 --> 01:49:34.137]  After that, hosting the War Room.
[01:49:35.538 --> 01:49:39.441]  And if I can get all the news off my desk, which it looks like I'll be able to, we'll take a bunch of calls.
[01:49:40.701 --> 01:49:43.904]  Let me get this political stack off my desk here.
[01:49:43.924 --> 01:49:46.946]  81 million votes!
[01:49:47.026 --> 01:49:52.389]  DNC forced to move Kamala Harris fundraiser to fall because they couldn't sell enough tickets.
[01:49:52.669 --> 01:49:53.109]  Wow.
[01:49:54.490 --> 01:49:56.472]  You know, the Kamala Harris story is a real interesting one.
[01:49:57.692 --> 01:49:59.854]  Here's a woman who slept her way to the top.
[01:50:01.713 --> 01:50:09.338]  And here's a woman who is the first female, and I suppose black, African-American.
[01:50:09.558 --> 01:50:11.779]  She's not African-American, but she pretends to be.
[01:50:12.479 --> 01:50:18.583]  She's Jamaican, and her family actually ran a slave camp, but they don't want you to know about that.
[01:50:19.524 --> 01:50:22.125]  Regardless, it's an interesting story.
[01:50:22.165 --> 01:50:27.768]  Here's Kamala Harris, the first black female vice president, and she's a nothing.
[01:50:27.849 --> 01:50:28.389]  She's a zero.
[01:50:30.982 --> 01:50:31.902]  You've always known that.
[01:50:31.943 --> 01:50:32.403]  I've always known that.
[01:50:32.703 --> 01:50:35.604]  What's interesting is, notice, she's not celebrated anymore.
[01:50:36.225 --> 01:50:38.125]  The media doesn't fawn over Kamala Harris.
[01:50:38.165 --> 01:50:39.566]  She's been a disappearing act.
[01:50:41.567 --> 01:50:42.147]  How is that?
[01:50:42.247 --> 01:50:43.308]  How is Kamala Harris?
[01:50:43.348 --> 01:50:44.268]  She's so great.
[01:50:44.328 --> 01:50:45.269]  She's unbelievable.
[01:50:46.049 --> 01:50:47.070]  She's a disappearing act.
[01:50:47.110 --> 01:50:47.710]  She's a nothing.
[01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:48.610]  She's a nobody.
[01:50:48.650 --> 01:50:50.291]  She's a zilch, a zero, a nada.
[01:50:50.751 --> 01:50:52.332]  The first female vice president?
[01:50:52.372 --> 01:50:55.314]  The first African-American female vice president?
[01:50:55.334 --> 01:50:58.235]  I mean, oh my gosh, there should be constant fanfare!
[01:50:59.055 --> 01:51:00.016]  Constant promotion!
[01:51:01.578 --> 01:51:02.818]  They've abandoned her.
[01:51:04.459 --> 01:51:04.799]  Why?
[01:51:05.439 --> 01:51:07.340]  Because she is a joke.
[01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:08.880]  She is an embarrassment.
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:16.482]  But aside from that, folks, because they put Jerry Nadler on the TV, so they don't really care about a joke and an embarrassment if you're a loyal Democrat.
[01:51:17.163 --> 01:51:21.044]  You know why they don't promote Kamala like you think they would?
[01:51:21.104 --> 01:51:22.724]  Because nobody likes her, folks.
[01:51:23.705 --> 01:51:24.425]  Nobody likes her.
[01:51:25.825 --> 01:51:28.266]  She is very, very unlikable.
[01:51:30.148 --> 01:51:31.289]  Democrats don't like her.
[01:51:31.309 --> 01:51:32.470]  The media doesn't like her.
[01:51:33.391 --> 01:51:34.892]  Nobody likes Kamala Harris.
[01:51:36.613 --> 01:51:37.354]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:51:37.414 --> 01:51:43.098]  The amazing, disappearing, first-ever female black vice president.
[01:51:43.959 --> 01:51:44.740]  No fanfare.
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:48.963]  The obsession has waned because nobody likes her and she's an embarrassment.
[01:51:49.924 --> 01:51:51.065]  It's just an amazing thing, isn't it?
[01:51:51.745 --> 01:51:52.786]  Oh, she's so great!
[01:51:52.966 --> 01:51:53.867]  Oh, first female!
[01:51:53.967 --> 01:51:55.548]  Oh, first African-American!
[01:51:55.628 --> 01:51:55.768]  Oh!
[01:51:56.509 --> 01:51:57.210]  Well, where is she?
[01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:58.050]  The Disappearing Act.
[01:51:58.110 --> 01:51:58.611]  Nobody cares.
[01:52:00.029 --> 01:52:04.512]  Press Secretary defends Biden's mental health from Don Lemon.
[01:52:04.572 --> 01:52:06.414]  That's not a question we should even be asking.
[01:52:06.674 --> 01:52:16.141]  Oh yeah, he just fumbles his words, slurs his word, craps his pants, forgets where he's at, takes every weekend off, gets a lid called on him by midday.
[01:52:16.702 --> 01:52:18.363]  Don't ask that question!
[01:52:18.463 --> 01:52:19.824]  Only ask that about Trump!
[01:52:20.344 --> 01:52:27.250]  Now, I want to get back to something I briefly discussed yesterday with Roger, not to belabor the point, but I couldn't really complete the process here.
[01:52:29.093 --> 01:52:42.876]  When I saw the text thread between Hannity and McEnany, it just to me screams, it just, it's... It's not an episode, it's the entire series.
[01:52:44.215 --> 01:52:45.995]  The New York, D.C.
[01:52:46.135 --> 01:52:48.136]  elitists that want to run the show.
[01:52:48.616 --> 01:52:56.238]  So when I see Hannity saying no more crazy people to McEnany, that's Hannity saying, hey, let me control who comes in and out of the White House.
[01:52:56.298 --> 01:52:59.699]  Let me control who has and doesn't have Trump's ear.
[01:53:00.359 --> 01:53:03.540]  We can't have these people getting in there, these crazy people.
[01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:06.340]  And by the way, stop talking about the stolen election.
[01:53:07.881 --> 01:53:09.021]  Stop talking about that.
[01:53:10.621 --> 01:53:12.102]  And let's pardon Hunter Biden.
[01:53:12.922 --> 01:53:13.182]  What?
[01:53:17.711 --> 01:53:19.312]  Very odd, right?
[01:53:19.372 --> 01:53:23.453]  From Sean Hannity, a patriot, and a proud American patriot fighting for your country!
[01:53:24.133 --> 01:53:26.814]  Wanting to control Trump's year in the White House?
[01:53:28.334 --> 01:53:30.595]  Wanting Trump to shut up about elections being stolen?
[01:53:31.095 --> 01:53:32.556]  Wanting to pardon Hunter Biden?
[01:53:34.016 --> 01:53:37.097]  Now, I'm not meaning this as an attack on Sean Hannity, quite frankly.
[01:53:37.297 --> 01:53:39.118]  The words and the text can speak for themselves.
[01:53:39.638 --> 01:53:44.100]  I'm saying it's an illustration of East Coast elitism, D.C.
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:48.933]   New York elitism, Thinking they run the show, nobody else should be able to run the show.
[01:53:49.493 --> 01:53:52.914]  And really, there's actually an angle of fear here.
[01:53:52.934 --> 01:54:00.395]  Because they understand their influence and their power, and maybe even their wealth, is illegitimate.
[01:54:01.476 --> 01:54:09.578]  And so they're afraid that if it's exposed as illegitimate, they'll no longer have that crown, they'll no longer have that throne that they've had for so long.
[01:54:09.898 --> 01:54:13.058]  It's part of the reason why they hated Trump, including Sean Hannity, when he was running.
[01:54:13.659 --> 01:54:14.739]  But see, here's what they've done.
[01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:25.228]  And again, I don't want to be critical of Jason Miller, who helps run GAB, but boy oh boy did they make him look bad during the January 6th hearing.
[01:54:26.889 --> 01:54:28.591]  Boy oh boy did they make him look bad.
[01:54:28.631 --> 01:54:31.794]  Miller says Rudy Giuliani was intoxicated on election night 2020.
[01:54:31.854 --> 01:54:42.763]  Now, I've been deposed a lot, so I know how this goes, but aside from the ins and outs and the psychology of deposition, here's what you really need to understand.
[01:54:44.329 --> 01:54:57.614]  They deposed these people for 8 to 10 hours, and they milked about 30 seconds to a minute of each deposition that they could use for their made-for-TV January 6th hearing event.
[01:54:58.502 --> 01:55:00.383]  So yeah, they make Miller look bad.
[01:55:00.684 --> 01:55:02.044]  Again, I don't want to be critical of Miller.
[01:55:02.064 --> 01:55:03.605]  I don't want to be critical of Hannity in all this.
[01:55:03.986 --> 01:55:06.107]  Their words, their things can speak for themselves.
[01:55:06.868 --> 01:55:18.155]  But you have to understand, they probably grilled Jason Miller for 10 hours, and then they took two minutes of his deposition to use for their Made for TV event to make him look bad and make Trump look bad.
[01:55:18.215 --> 01:55:19.836]  That's what these lawyers do.
[01:55:20.337 --> 01:55:24.099]  And that's honestly kind of typical in a deposition, quite frankly, for cases.
[01:55:24.139 --> 01:55:28.282]  So it's not that out of the norm, but that's what they did.
[01:55:29.683 --> 01:55:35.389]  So, oh, let's grill this person for 10 hours so that we can get 30 seconds of content out of them.
[01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:37.712]  And that's what the Democrats and their lawyers have done.
[01:55:38.252 --> 01:55:43.978]  Now this is all illegitimate to begin with, unlike other cases where deposition may go down, but that's the process.
[01:55:44.819 --> 01:55:48.083]  And of course, Bill Barr, we thought he was a loyal American patriot.
[01:55:48.103 --> 01:55:49.785]  Turns out he's a deep state hack as well.
[01:55:50.728 --> 01:55:56.614]  Dinesh D'Souza challenges Bill Barr to debate on merits of his movie because Bill Barr laughed it off and said there's nothing to see here.
[01:55:57.635 --> 01:55:59.858]  So he turns out to hate us as well.
[01:56:00.659 --> 01:56:03.862]  So he must like his cushy little role in the deep state.
[01:56:04.463 --> 01:56:07.786]  But Dinesh D'Souza challenges Bill Barr to debate.
[01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:11.172]  Bill Barr won't show up, my guess is.
[01:56:11.212 --> 01:56:11.733]  He's a coward.
[01:56:12.434 --> 01:56:16.921]  Mayor Rudy Giuliani gives statement to the Gateway Pundit regarding the fraudulent January 6th hearing.
[01:56:17.122 --> 01:56:19.686]  What role did Antifa and the FBI play?
[01:56:19.826 --> 01:56:22.250]  That's the key question, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:27.051]  And more and more people are starting to realize that's the key question.
[01:56:27.971 --> 01:56:33.594]  And I think that's part of the reason why the Democrats called off the rest of their January 6 hearings.
[01:56:33.914 --> 01:56:43.760]  Not only was it doing bad in the ratings, not only was it making them look bad, they understand that the more people that are actually looking into January 6, the more people are asking, hey, was it Antifa?
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:45.000]  Hey, was it the FBI?
[01:56:45.701 --> 01:56:47.522]  And they don't want that conversation out there.
[01:56:48.442 --> 01:56:52.305]  So they're going to have to basically circle back here, if you will, to make a Jen Psaki joke.
[01:56:52.846 --> 01:56:56.149]  They're going to have to circle back because they got to put this to bed, folks.
[01:56:56.169 --> 01:56:58.431]  They can't have people knowing about the FBI embeds.
[01:56:58.751 --> 01:57:03.435]  They can't have people know about Antifa showing up on the front lines and then changing into Trump gear.
[01:57:03.715 --> 01:57:04.596]  It's all on tape.
[01:57:04.636 --> 01:57:06.057]  We have re-eps all there.
[01:57:06.377 --> 01:57:13.724]  So they have to find a way to bury all that before they bring the next round of January 6 trials to the TV, because too many people are asking the right questions.
[01:57:15.289 --> 01:57:23.435]  Bill Barr tells Congress he was not interested in investigating any ballot trafficking in the 2020 election, then openly laughed about it during testimony.
[01:57:24.036 --> 01:57:27.078]  Again, Bill Barr turned out to be a deep stater.
[01:57:27.879 --> 01:57:28.619]  We were warned, though.
[01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:34.944]  Ousted Fox News editor hosts help fuel murderous Trump world rage over Arizona call.
[01:57:35.484 --> 01:57:35.905]  Oh, yes.
[01:57:37.045 --> 01:57:41.129]  Yeah, Fox News and conservatives are the ones that are fueling murderous rage.
[01:57:41.630 --> 01:57:42.371]  Give me a break.
[01:57:42.431 --> 01:57:46.315]  If that's not liberals and Democrats and their friends in the media, then it doesn't exist.
[01:57:47.676 --> 01:57:48.557]  This is an interesting one.
[01:57:48.597 --> 01:57:52.040]  Trump bilked small donors out of $250 million based on lies.
[01:57:52.461 --> 01:57:55.584]  Now, the Republican Party continues to fundraise in Trump's name.
[01:57:56.125 --> 01:57:57.046]  It's obnoxious.
[01:57:58.564 --> 01:58:06.709]  And they're saying, oh, Trump fraudulently raised emails because he said the election was stolen, which the people that donated probably still believe that anyway.
[01:58:07.289 --> 01:58:11.731]  So you may think it's a lie, as a liberal, but the people that donated didn't.
[01:58:11.771 --> 01:58:12.432]  But that's not the point.
[01:58:13.052 --> 01:58:14.753]  All Democrats do is lie!
[01:58:15.594 --> 01:58:18.075]  All Democrats do is lie and fundraise off lies.
[01:58:18.315 --> 01:58:21.237]  If Democrats couldn't fundraise off lies, they'd have no money!
[01:58:22.577 --> 01:58:24.879]  Trump endorsed gubernational candidate Carrie Lake.
[01:58:25.649 --> 01:58:29.772]  Headlines, Walk Away Campaign, PAC Inaugural Event, and Scottsdale.
[01:58:30.073 --> 01:58:33.515]  Be poll watchers, be poll workers, and watch these bastards like a hawk.
[01:58:33.715 --> 01:58:34.376]  Exactly.
[01:58:34.596 --> 01:58:37.258]  And they will be, folks, because more people are skeptical of our elections.
[01:58:37.478 --> 01:58:39.780]  By the way, where's the walk away movement for the right?
[01:58:39.860 --> 01:58:40.621]  Oh yeah, it doesn't exist.
[01:58:40.661 --> 01:58:43.383]  You have the legs it, the legs it, and walk away because everyone's leaving the Democrat Party.
[01:58:43.403 --> 01:58:44.124]  They're a bunch of criminals.
[01:58:47.233 --> 01:59:08.493]  People are really realizing the double standard here, especially after watching Democrats complain about protests as their Democrat activists burn cities to the ground and loot and plunder and pillage and murder at will, while being protected by Democrat Soros district attorneys.
[01:59:08.533 --> 01:59:10.935]  So everybody's watching this, they can't really cover it up.
[01:59:11.991 --> 01:59:14.452]  And so, liberals are in D.C.
[01:59:14.792 --> 01:59:16.092]  They're at it again today.
[01:59:16.452 --> 01:59:20.613]  They're pissed because they think they might not be able to abort their babies, or I don't know what else.
[01:59:20.993 --> 01:59:26.694]  And so, it's the liberal summer of rage, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:30.275 --> 01:59:33.036]  The liberal summer of rage continues.
[01:59:33.056 --> 01:59:39.617]  Kavanaugh's neighbor claims pro-abortion protesters are threatening homeowners, F you and F your children.
[01:59:40.427 --> 01:59:44.490]  Wow, really loving people, these liberal protesters.
[01:59:45.030 --> 01:59:54.897]  And they've also doxxed Amy Coney Barrett's children's schools, because, you know, torturing and threatening to kill Supreme Court justices isn't enough for these liberal psychos.
[01:59:55.237 --> 01:59:57.138]  They also want to target their children.
[01:59:57.658 --> 02:00:01.181]  Ah, the liberal summer of rage continues.
[02:00:01.661 --> 02:00:03.642]  And you've got two groups in D.C.
[02:00:04.143 --> 02:00:05.283]  that are raging right now.
[02:00:05.383 --> 02:00:14.792]   You've got Jane's Revenge, Which, by the way, Jane's Revenge has taken responsibility for at least four pregnancy centers being firebombed.
[02:00:15.232 --> 02:00:17.293]  I think the total number is now up to ten.
[02:00:17.313 --> 02:00:20.474]  I think ten since the leak.
[02:00:20.854 --> 02:00:24.296]  Ten pregnancy centers have been firebombed by raging liberals.
[02:00:25.236 --> 02:00:26.917]  It's the liberal summer of rage after all.
[02:00:27.890 --> 02:00:31.534]  And so they're raging, and they're burning pregnancy centers to the ground.
[02:00:31.555 --> 02:00:32.436]  That's Jane's Revenge.
[02:00:32.696 --> 02:00:35.639]  And they've got this call to action, D.C.
[02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:37.582]  call to action, Night of Rage.
[02:00:37.802 --> 02:00:42.908]  Folks, you have to understand, I cut that special stinger that you see, Liberal Summer of Rage.
[02:00:43.749 --> 02:00:53.276]  Like a month ago, and I've already been saying Liberal Summer of Rage, anticipating it, and then I said, look, this is coming, this is going to be a big story, let's even have a stinger so that we cover it, we can have a little intro.
[02:00:53.656 --> 02:00:54.857]  It's the Liberal Summer of Rage.
[02:00:55.237 --> 02:00:56.318]  I knew this was coming.
[02:00:56.638 --> 02:01:02.402]  It was so predictable this was coming, I literally was cutting specials months in advance in anticipation.
[02:01:02.882 --> 02:01:07.265]  Oh, but the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, they can't figure out who the real domestic terrorists are yet.
[02:01:07.366 --> 02:01:09.467]  No, they know exactly who the domestic terrorists are.
[02:01:09.767 --> 02:01:10.268]  It's them.
[02:01:10.628 --> 02:01:10.988]  Liberals.
[02:01:11.228 --> 02:01:11.749]  Democrats.
[02:01:12.449 --> 02:01:14.811]  So you've got Jane's Addiction telling people to riot.
[02:01:14.951 --> 02:01:16.432]  Excuse me, not Jane's Addiction, the band.
[02:01:16.772 --> 02:01:22.356]  Jane's Revenge telling people to riot with flyers they're posting around DC.
[02:01:23.544 --> 02:01:27.365]  And then you have the second group called Shut Down D.C.
[02:01:28.266 --> 02:01:43.371]  that's running around committing crimes, criminal acts, threatening violence, that has lawyers embedded in their little groups and bail bondsmen embedded in their little groups because they're planning on committing crimes and getting arrested.
[02:01:43.751 --> 02:01:47.112]  So then most of the time the police either don't bother arresting them because what's the point?
[02:01:47.172 --> 02:01:48.973]  It's a waste of energy, it's a waste of their time.
[02:01:49.173 --> 02:01:50.714]  They know they're just going to be released anyway.
[02:01:51.744 --> 02:01:52.644]  I've been behind the scenes.
[02:01:52.704 --> 02:01:54.165]  I've been told how it goes down, folks.
[02:01:56.445 --> 02:02:00.426]  Liberals and Democrats that get arrested protesting, the farthest they make it is booking.
[02:02:00.666 --> 02:02:02.386]  That's the farthest they make it.
[02:02:02.986 --> 02:02:08.147]  And usually by then, a call comes down to their precinct that says, release these individuals.
[02:02:08.448 --> 02:02:08.748]  Okay?
[02:02:09.128 --> 02:02:09.848]  I've been there.
[02:02:10.328 --> 02:02:11.568]  I've been behind the scenes.
[02:02:11.788 --> 02:02:12.648]  I've been arrested.
[02:02:12.788 --> 02:02:14.149]  I've had the inside scoop.
[02:02:14.269 --> 02:02:15.669]  I've had the whistleblowers tell me this.
[02:02:15.709 --> 02:02:18.490]  Now, they don't want to go public for obvious reasons.
[02:02:18.650 --> 02:02:19.930]  They don't want to lose their job.
[02:02:21.385 --> 02:02:27.519]  So, I'm just telling you this exclusively because I was told this the multiple times I was arrested.
[02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:30.747]  The police that arrest me, the police that are there behind the scenes, I've already said too much.
[02:02:30.787 --> 02:02:30.887]  So...
[02:02:32.443 --> 02:02:36.904]  Liberals know they can riot and rage and commit crimes and nothing happens to them.
[02:02:37.564 --> 02:02:43.966]  You're a Trump supporter, you're a conservative, you're a Christian, you step on a blade of grass sideways in DC, they're coming after you with the full force of the law.
[02:02:44.526 --> 02:02:54.188]  And they will be arresting people for January 6th until the year 2050 if these Democrats are not removed from our political system as the domestic terrorist groups that they are.
[02:02:54.228 --> 02:03:01.850]  But so the point is, people are just watching what the left is up to, watching them begin another summer of rage and rioting.
[02:03:02.813 --> 02:03:05.195]  But then they're told, oh, white people are the problem.
[02:03:05.755 --> 02:03:07.056]  Oh, conservatives are the problem.
[02:03:07.076 --> 02:03:08.297]  Oh, Trump supporters are the problem.
[02:03:08.657 --> 02:03:12.760]  And everybody who's living in reality knows, of course, that's not the truth.
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:18.764]  But it's even worse juxtaposed with the liberals getting ready to riot and rage again, just like they did in 2020.
[02:03:19.024 --> 02:03:20.265]  So here's some of the clips, guys.
[02:03:20.906 --> 02:03:21.666]  Let's go to this clip 16.
[02:03:23.107 --> 02:03:30.772]  This is the type of treatment that the cops have to put up with because liberals are above the law, just like the officer that gets sexually molested.
[02:03:31.707 --> 02:03:35.928]  by a liberal sexually molested in the streets, but oh, he's gay, he's a liberal, so he's allowed to do it.
[02:03:36.909 --> 02:03:44.311]  This is the type of treatment the cops have to deal with from liberals because they're told by the Democrats, you don't touch our protesters here in Clip 16.
[02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:58.750]  clip 16.
[02:03:58.807 --> 02:03:59.748]  That's assault.
[02:03:59.848 --> 02:04:15.654]  So the cop tries to stop him, but he can't do an arrest because the Democrats tell him you're not allowed to arrest their protesters.
[02:04:15.614 --> 02:04:17.614]  So then he just assaults an officer.
[02:04:17.614 --> 02:04:19.614]  Cops and clans go hand in hand!
[02:04:19.614 --> 02:04:21.614]  Cops and clans go hand in hand!
[02:04:21.614 --> 02:04:23.614]  Cops and clans go hand in hand!
[02:04:23.614 --> 02:04:25.614]  And then he says cops and clan go hands in hand.
[02:04:25.614 --> 02:04:35.614]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:04:26.758 --> 02:04:30.000]  The Ku Klux Klan made sure to put Planned Parenthoods in inner cities.
[02:04:30.021 --> 02:04:30.821]  Here, pause it real quick.
[02:04:30.961 --> 02:04:34.004]  So, so, I mean, again, folks, like, this is just, it's unbelievable.
[02:04:35.325 --> 02:04:38.488]  The cops are not allowed to arrest Democrat liberal activists.
[02:04:38.648 --> 02:04:44.293]  They're told that, and they've just learned through the process of time, it's a waste of their time anyway, they're going to get released when they get to the jail.
[02:04:46.170 --> 02:04:51.638]  Okay, so then this guy's out here assaulting officers with this amplified device, putting it in their faces, putting it in citizens' faces.
[02:04:51.658 --> 02:04:52.439]  That's a crime, folks.
[02:04:52.519 --> 02:04:53.060]  That is a crime.
[02:04:53.100 --> 02:04:57.346]  You cannot put an amplified sound device in somebody's ear that can cause permanent damage like tinnitus.
[02:04:57.667 --> 02:04:58.207]  That's a crime.
[02:04:58.628 --> 02:05:00.430]  Liberals able to do it, and then does it to a cop.
[02:05:01.021 --> 02:05:05.844]  Then he says cops are like the Klan as he holds up a Planned Parenthood sign.
[02:05:06.445 --> 02:05:15.811]  Planned Parenthood that intentionally made sure they put their centers in black areas so that they could make sure to cull the black population.
[02:05:16.351 --> 02:05:27.039]  And this guy's out here culling cops, Klan members, as he promotes groups that the Klan promoted, Planned Parenthood, to kill black people that still kill more black people than anyone else in this world?
[02:05:27.879 --> 02:05:28.939]  Planned Parenthood, Democrats?
[02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:33.241]  There's no one in the world that has killed more black people than Democrats in Planned Parenthood.
[02:05:33.481 --> 02:05:34.542]  Nobody in the world.
[02:05:35.822 --> 02:05:36.422]  Oh, the irony.
[02:05:37.403 --> 02:05:38.923]  Let's continue the clip here.
[02:05:38.743 --> 02:05:59.582]  here I'll let it finish.
[02:05:59.561 --> 02:06:03.482]  Totally illegal.
[02:06:03.682 --> 02:06:11.806]  Oh my gosh.
[02:06:11.906 --> 02:06:15.967]  He loves abortion so much, doesn't he?
[02:06:16.147 --> 02:06:17.468]  Alright, that's enough guys.
[02:06:17.568 --> 02:06:18.408]  I can't handle it either.
[02:06:18.448 --> 02:06:18.929]  It goes on.
[02:06:19.029 --> 02:06:19.849]  It just continues.
[02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:21.830]  And then he starts grinding on cops again.
[02:06:23.086 --> 02:06:28.631]  Yeah, there's Margaret Sanger founding a Planned Parenthood talking about how we're going to use Planned Parenthood to eliminate the black population.
[02:06:29.517 --> 02:06:33.980]  And then these people go out claiming that they're against racism as they promote Planned Parenthood.
[02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:41.604]  But pro-life individuals are getting in the mix, but again, if you didn't see it, the guy ends up literally grinding on the police officer again.
[02:06:41.624 --> 02:06:47.328]  I mean, what these cops have to deal with, these liberal psychopaths, it's just, it's so criminal they're forced to deal with this.
[02:06:47.768 --> 02:06:53.207]   But here's some conservative pro-life people trying to stop the baby murderers here in clip 17.
[02:06:53.207 --> 02:07:07.606]  [Chanting]
[02:07:07.606 --> 02:07:09.207]  I thought we had to listen to all women.
[02:07:09.373 --> 02:07:11.775]  Oh no, only listen to them if they promote our propaganda.
[02:07:13.916 --> 02:07:17.739]  Believe all women, only if they're talking of accusing Republicans.
[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:29.507]  So good for that young girl for being out there and getting assaulted by these liberal psychopaths, these liberal baby murderers, these liberal racists.
[02:07:32.915 --> 02:07:34.215]  Good for her for being out there.
[02:07:34.295 --> 02:07:35.376]  Alright, one more here.
[02:07:35.996 --> 02:07:36.356]  One more.
[02:07:36.416 --> 02:07:39.157]  Here's some more of the abortion protests in D.C.
[02:07:39.217 --> 02:07:44.579]  Listen to what they're saying and tell me if you said this if you would not be arrested here in Clip 19.
[02:07:45.579 --> 02:07:46.479]  Call your mom!
[02:07:46.799 --> 02:07:48.200]  Call your extended family!
[02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:51.341]  Get in the goddamn streets and be loud!
[02:07:52.061 --> 02:07:53.101]  Be disruptive!
[02:07:53.822 --> 02:07:55.942]  Stand in traffic if you can!
[02:07:56.302 --> 02:07:57.763]  Cause commotion!
[02:07:59.321 --> 02:08:01.264]  Because we can't stop this.
[02:08:01.904 --> 02:08:02.585]  We can.
[02:08:03.086 --> 02:08:05.449]  But we have to make them see us.
[02:08:05.950 --> 02:08:07.552]  We have to be so large.
[02:08:07.572 --> 02:08:16.944]  We have to be so large that they question whether or not they will be perceived as legitimate if they let this pass.
[02:08:18.151 --> 02:08:18.531]  Wow!
[02:08:19.131 --> 02:08:24.174]  Could you imagine if that was a conservative activist or a Republican congressman or Donald Trump saying stuff like that?
[02:08:24.274 --> 02:08:24.994]  Boy, oh boy!
[02:08:25.394 --> 02:08:34.999]  They'd be called a domestic terrorist, there'd be guns drawn raids, there'd be arrests, criminal prosecutions, depositions, hearings, but liberals, they're allowed to do it.
[02:08:35.059 --> 02:08:36.560]  It's really frustrating, isn't it folks?
[02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:39.781]  And look, we just all pray this comes to an end someday.
[02:08:40.902 --> 02:08:45.524]  Liberals and psychos and racists are always going to exist and they'll always make up the Democrat Party.
[02:08:46.567 --> 02:08:51.112]  But you know, it'd be nice to just have at least equal application of law and law enforcement.
[02:08:51.592 --> 02:08:57.198]  At least equal application of logic and how we deal with these things, but we don't get any of that, do we?
[02:08:57.258 --> 02:08:58.399]  Liberals are above the law.
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:02.724]  They can break the law, riot, do violence, terrorism, and they're allowed.
[02:09:03.064 --> 02:09:06.105]  All right, Kate Dally is going to be taking over here in five minutes.
[02:09:06.805 --> 02:09:09.626]  But, ladies and gentlemen, I have to come on here and tell you something.
[02:09:10.507 --> 02:09:11.807]  It shouldn't be a surprise.
[02:09:12.807 --> 02:09:19.710]  I'm kind of the same way in my media consumption, and I've been in media for almost 20 years now, hard to believe, even though I'm young.
[02:09:19.950 --> 02:09:21.891]  Spent the majority of my life in media.
[02:09:21.991 --> 02:09:22.831]  And so I understand.
[02:09:24.107 --> 02:09:31.932]  When Alex is out, a lot of people aren't tuning in, and when Alex is out, a lot of people aren't going to InfoWarsStore.com to support us.
[02:09:32.612 --> 02:09:51.504]   And so, Alex tends to go see those numbers down, and I won't say panics, but has the response you might expect, because we've been real close to things not being so good, and once we finally look like, hey, maybe we're going to be in an operational capacity now, And then he takes off and it's like, ooh, are we sliding down again?
[02:09:51.904 --> 02:09:54.306]  So folks, don't forget about InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:09:55.206 --> 02:09:56.908]  Don't forget about PrepareToday.com.
[02:09:57.088 --> 02:10:03.192]  I wish I could promote our air filters right now, but unfortunately because of the Biden economy, they're not making them anymore.
[02:10:04.052 --> 02:10:06.715]  Uh, and so I'm not sure if we're ever going to have another run of air filters.
[02:10:06.815 --> 02:10:11.519]  Biden's economy, you can't even get the supplies, let alone get them transferred because it's so expensive now.
[02:10:12.139 --> 02:10:15.242]  But you can still get the air filters.
[02:10:15.842 --> 02:10:19.605]  So if you do have an Alexa Pure Breeze system, you can still get the air filters.
[02:10:19.625 --> 02:10:30.695]  This is very important for people to know at preparetoday.com because I'm sure a lot of people out there like me that have the Alexa Pure Breeze in their house know about, I change mine about every eight months.
[02:10:32.111 --> 02:10:35.733]  Uh, maybe sometimes a little bit sooner, maybe sometimes a little bit later, just depending on the season, I guess.
[02:10:36.233 --> 02:10:51.141]  But, uh, you can still get the replacement filter, so important, at preparetoday.com, where we've sourced out the best storable foods for the best prices at preparetoday.com.
[02:10:51.301 --> 02:10:55.284]  So that's really the most important thing there, preparetoday.com, get your emergency food.
[02:10:56.598 --> 02:11:00.642]  There's also supplies for air filtration, water filtration, other emergency supplies.
[02:11:00.682 --> 02:11:07.909]  We just wanted to give you a one-stop shop because you're watching the Democrats and the globalists destroy this country, the Great Reset happening.
[02:11:07.929 --> 02:11:10.992]  You're thinking, well what can I do for insurance for me and my family?
[02:11:11.032 --> 02:11:14.916]  What can I do to make sure in case there's a food crisis that I'm taken care of?
[02:11:16.072 --> 02:11:19.616]  And so we gave you the site, preparetoday.com.
[02:11:19.656 --> 02:11:23.560]  It's the one-stop shop to get prepared for the Biden collapse.
[02:11:23.961 --> 02:11:28.846]  But I was showing this earlier, folks, and I just sent you guys the image so we can put the shot on the screen.
[02:11:29.747 --> 02:11:32.169]  These are my air filters, okay?
[02:11:32.930 --> 02:11:35.873]  Guys, zoom out a little bit there so we can get the full shot.
[02:11:37.011 --> 02:11:38.993]  These are my air filters.
[02:11:39.793 --> 02:11:44.137]  The one on the right, now understand, I live alone, okay, so I'm just one person.
[02:11:44.858 --> 02:11:46.479]  Nobody smokes, there's no smokers.
[02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:50.323]  I don't have any pets, so no cats or dog hair, anything like that.
[02:11:50.843 --> 02:11:51.684]  Just me.
[02:11:52.344 --> 02:11:53.625]  And I also have two others.
[02:11:53.806 --> 02:11:55.707]  So there's three of these things running in my house.
[02:11:56.468 --> 02:11:58.990]  I just replaced one of them, the filter in one of them.
[02:11:59.050 --> 02:12:00.652]  Folks, look at that.
[02:12:01.650 --> 02:12:09.334]  I mean, that is, I mean, aside from me sitting here and promoting a great product that funds the operation, I mean, look at that!
[02:12:09.414 --> 02:12:11.455]  That's in my house over eight months?
[02:12:11.815 --> 02:12:13.756]  How is the air in my house so dirty?
[02:12:14.096 --> 02:12:18.218]  Nobody smokes, I live alone, I don't even have house guests, let alone pets.
[02:12:19.379 --> 02:12:20.399]  Folks, look at that!
[02:12:20.439 --> 02:12:22.040]  I mean, that is a story in and of itself.
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:25.762]  But the stories are already out there, they tell you, the average U.S.
[02:12:25.802 --> 02:12:28.724]   home The air in the average U.S.
[02:12:28.764 --> 02:12:32.728]  home is as polluted as the air in major metropolitan areas.
[02:12:33.209 --> 02:12:40.637]  So folks, get your air filters at preparetoday.com because you don't want to be having that dirty air filter that you see on the right.
[02:12:40.677 --> 02:12:41.978]  That was eight months of use.
[02:12:42.298 --> 02:12:45.682]  I obviously replaced it with the clean one on the left, so I'll get another eight months out of that.
[02:12:46.443 --> 02:12:48.005]  But you don't want to be breathing in that air.
[02:12:49.033 --> 02:12:53.855]  And most of the time, the filters won't even work if your filter is that clogged up.
[02:12:54.535 --> 02:12:56.176]  So, just incredible though.
[02:12:56.576 --> 02:13:03.718]  Get your replacement filter at preparetoday.com while you're there, looking at emergency food supplies, looking at emergency supplies.
[02:13:04.559 --> 02:13:06.499]  Get your replacement filters as well, folks.
[02:13:06.579 --> 02:13:08.460]  I mean, is that not stunning, for real?
[02:13:08.660 --> 02:13:12.222]  Is that not absolutely stunning to see how polluted the air in my house was?
[02:13:12.862 --> 02:13:13.822]  I couldn't believe it, folks.
[02:13:14.122 --> 02:13:14.922]  And I don't live downtown!
[02:13:16.503 --> 02:13:23.326]  I mean, I got a small little neighborhood with plenty of trees and everything around my house, and I was just... I mean, but it happens every time.
[02:13:23.406 --> 02:13:28.869]  Every time I replace that filter, I'm just stunned at how polluted the air in my house is.
[02:13:28.909 --> 02:13:30.630]  You wouldn't believe it unless you saw it.
[02:13:30.990 --> 02:13:31.590]  And there it is.
[02:13:31.671 --> 02:13:32.231]  So, folks...
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:49.931]  Whether it's that or all the big sales happening right now at InfoWarsTore.com, like the immune support sales, 60% off immune support products at InfoWarsTore.com in a package, or just your favorite supplements at InfoWarsTore.com, your support at InfoWarsTore.com keeps us on the air.
[02:13:50.431 --> 02:13:51.832]  Kate Daly takes over now.
[02:13:51.952 --> 02:13:53.433]  I'll be back hosting the War Room.
[02:13:53.793 --> 02:13:54.774]  I'll see you in an hour.
[02:13:54.794 --> 02:13:56.855]  Hi, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:57.076 --> 02:14:00.658]  I am your guest host, Kate Daly from KateDalyRadio.com.
[02:14:00.718 --> 02:14:02.119]  So glad to be with you today.
[02:14:02.219 --> 02:14:03.080]  It's the summer.
[02:14:04.100 --> 02:14:05.442]  I love the summer, right?
[02:14:05.962 --> 02:14:09.185]  And so today we're going to be talking about summer lies.
[02:14:10.066 --> 02:14:11.708]  And boy, do I have some great info for you.
[02:14:12.348 --> 02:14:15.011]  You want to find real gas without ethanol in it?
[02:14:15.351 --> 02:14:17.033]  You want to find out what it's doing to our engines?
[02:14:17.053 --> 02:14:23.979]  Do you want to find out all about these fake arrests and of course the destruction of our food supply?
[02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:25.561]  Yeah, great topics.
[02:14:25.761 --> 02:14:27.943]  I love lies during the summer, said no one ever.
[02:14:29.432 --> 02:14:35.216]  Yeah, I remember, you know, when I was coming into work, I was listening to the radio and there was a song from 1982.
[02:14:36.057 --> 02:14:39.160]  And it brought me right back to that year, right?
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:41.322]  And that was high school for me.
[02:14:41.642 --> 02:14:46.886]  And I just remember just thinking, you know, you went to parties and went to the beach.
[02:14:46.987 --> 02:14:47.767]  I grew up in California.
[02:14:48.548 --> 02:14:49.028]  Yeah, sorry.
[02:14:49.429 --> 02:14:52.651]  Anyway, and I did all these things and wow, things have changed.
[02:14:53.272 --> 02:14:53.472]  Wow.
[02:14:56.241 --> 02:14:59.123]  We have so many lies that I only could pull a couple.
[02:14:59.544 --> 02:15:02.866]  And honestly, that's where we're kind of at right now.
[02:15:03.207 --> 02:15:04.287]  What are we being lied to?
[02:15:04.808 --> 02:15:06.249]  And I want to talk about sunscreen.
[02:15:06.449 --> 02:15:11.253]  I want to talk about skin cancer and some things that might surprise you, I think.
[02:15:11.553 --> 02:15:20.961]  Also, when we started out, of course, our summer for 2022, we started out with a set of arrests, right, from the Patriot Front group.
[02:15:21.181 --> 02:15:21.421]  Okay.
[02:15:22.139 --> 02:15:23.580]  And so I do want to talk about that.
[02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:25.861]  I just came off a week of camping.
[02:15:26.041 --> 02:15:27.662]  It's like an exercise in homelessness.
[02:15:27.682 --> 02:15:29.702]  I'm really good at it.
[02:15:30.303 --> 02:15:30.743]  No, I'm not.
[02:15:30.923 --> 02:15:32.804]  I'm not really good at it, but I love it.
[02:15:32.884 --> 02:15:38.046]  And it's really nice to get away, get away, get into the mountains, just get away from all the junk.
[02:15:38.526 --> 02:15:41.108]  Seriously, it'll do a body good, just like milk, right?
[02:15:41.128 --> 02:15:41.868]  It'll do a body good.
[02:15:42.572 --> 02:15:44.533]  I highly recommend going on vacation.
[02:15:45.553 --> 02:15:51.176]  But while I was gone, we had this silly arrest, this whole setup with the Patriot Front Group.
[02:15:51.636 --> 02:15:58.679]  And of course you had matching outfits, matching gaiters, matching hats, matching khakis, U-Haul Transpo.
[02:16:00.069 --> 02:16:06.616]  You know, when you look at real patriots, when you understand who real patriots are, it's like herding cats.
[02:16:07.156 --> 02:16:14.363]  It's very difficult to get two people to even wear the same t-shirt, let alone matching outfits all the way head to toe.
[02:16:15.364 --> 02:16:30.848]   The people that design these groups, whether it's feds or whether it's straight up liberal communist globalists, You have a section of society that paints everything like they paint themselves, so make these groups kind of look like a soft Antifa.
[02:16:31.768 --> 02:16:35.391]  And that's the problem, is we're all going, yeah, that's not how we operate.
[02:16:36.171 --> 02:16:41.694]  What we really need to do in this country is point out the obvious on groups like this, right?
[02:16:41.774 --> 02:16:43.976]  They're well-funded, somebody's at the helm.
[02:16:44.036 --> 02:16:48.358]  When was the last time you were invited to a neighborhood party for the Patriot Front?
[02:16:48.718 --> 02:16:49.459]  I'm guessing you weren't.
[02:16:50.231 --> 02:16:53.234]  And so these groups are a little bit more exclusive, right?
[02:16:53.514 --> 02:17:23.545]   And whether they're taking really naive people and trying to set them up, or whether these people are in on it, I do have to say, we either get this, we either get the matching mini ISIS, remember ISIS with the matching outfits and Toyota trucks, the white outfits they would never wear over in the Middle East, And then we get this, or we get the feds, the moronic feds, the power-hungry feds, dressed up with their matching sunglasses and the long shorts with the t-shirts, and they stand out and they look ridiculous.
[02:17:24.085 --> 02:17:27.269]  But they love to follow orders, so they're gonna go do whatever they're told to do.
[02:17:28.087 --> 02:17:33.612]  So that's the kind of thing that they paint us to be, although the majority of the country really isn't that.
[02:17:33.772 --> 02:17:43.340]  So I just wanted to point out that they have new groups like National Action Task Force, all these different groups, the NATF, right?
[02:17:43.580 --> 02:17:46.382]  Pennsylvania Avenue, right there in Washington, D.C.
[02:17:46.402 --> 02:17:54.209]   I always like it when I'm a patriot and I go to the groups that are funded And warehoused in Washington, D.C.
[02:17:54.729 --> 02:17:59.094]  It just screams, it came from natural sources, right?
[02:17:59.794 --> 02:18:00.155]  Wrong.
[02:18:00.555 --> 02:18:11.005]  So these state juror assemblies, I'd be really careful about being hoodwinked into these types of groups because the minute you really start to organize, then you have to ask yourself, who's at the helm?
[02:18:11.065 --> 02:18:11.806]  Who's funding it?
[02:18:12.286 --> 02:18:14.569]  And of course, I know I'm preaching to the choir right now.
[02:18:14.889 --> 02:18:15.710]  I know you all know this.
[02:18:16.579 --> 02:18:26.101]  And as ridiculous as these people look, whether they're being played or they're in on it, it's just a sad commentary on our nation that these are the people that design these groups.
[02:18:26.401 --> 02:18:37.123]  And I love it when they say they're not part of corporate government, but they're just investigators working with the FBI to help us.
[02:18:38.223 --> 02:18:39.704]  Sure, I totally believe that.
[02:18:40.464 --> 02:18:40.744]  Don't you?
[02:18:41.590 --> 02:18:43.311]  Yes, over in naive land.
[02:18:43.391 --> 02:18:44.132]  We all believe it.
[02:18:44.532 --> 02:18:49.695]  So as they get more ridiculous, I actually think this stuff is getting easier to spot.
[02:18:50.596 --> 02:19:01.298]   These groups are ridiculous looking and Anyway, I had a friend go over and interview them and my friend Todd, and he said, you know what?
[02:19:01.418 --> 02:19:03.719]  These groups, these aren't the guys.
[02:19:03.860 --> 02:19:06.581]  These aren't the hateful guys, okay?
[02:19:06.921 --> 02:19:12.824]  These are guys basically either being warped into this or used, you know, or set up.
[02:19:13.064 --> 02:19:16.566]  So, you know, any way you go, somebody's at the helm doing this.
[02:19:17.246 --> 02:19:24.774]  Alright, so I want to talk a little bit about sunscreen to you because I am a person that has had many cancers removed, right?
[02:19:24.834 --> 02:19:26.356]  Pre-cancers removed, all kinds.
[02:19:26.997 --> 02:19:32.342]  And so my whole life, I grew up at the beach and I stuck out because I was so pale, dark hair.
[02:19:32.403 --> 02:19:37.328]  Here's all my friends, they look like Barbies and here I am on the beach.
[02:19:37.988 --> 02:19:40.229]  So, of course, very burnt all the time.
[02:19:40.670 --> 02:19:55.337]  But as I was on vacation and I was watching kids get slathered up, and I mean slathered and gassed, with sunscreen moms just, you know, just... I mean, honestly, they were inhaling it.
[02:19:55.357 --> 02:19:57.658]  I was really kind of fearful for these kids.
[02:19:58.458 --> 02:20:07.740]  But I thought, you know, there's something very wrong with this whole industry because as I was starting to look back at the rates and the numbers, something really stuck out to me.
[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:19.962]  And that was, they started regulating and kind of putting it out there and saying that you need it and it was recommended that we should start taking the sunscreen products, right?
[02:20:20.702 --> 02:20:22.262]  Every time we were in the sun.
[02:20:22.942 --> 02:20:26.903]  And I find it interesting that in our whole evolution...
[02:20:28.481 --> 02:20:29.521]  Of personhood.
[02:20:30.182 --> 02:20:33.922]  We spent more time in the fields and had 95% farmers.
[02:20:33.942 --> 02:20:38.764]  95% of us were farmers and ranchers and everything else about 100 years ago.
[02:20:39.524 --> 02:20:50.186]  So I find it kind of interesting that all along, the rate for sun cancer was actually really low, skin cancer, really, really, really low.
[02:20:50.266 --> 02:20:58.251]   And it stayed low up until the 70s, right about the time that they started recommending Sunscreen.
[02:20:59.392 --> 02:21:02.354]  And sunscreen has a lot of different ingredients in it.
[02:21:03.115 --> 02:21:11.320]  And parents out there are basically gassing their kids, and as the kid tries to turn around, the kid's so desperate to go in the pool, he'll do anything.
[02:21:11.561 --> 02:21:20.527]  So, if the mom is slathering him up, and then spraying him, and then slathering, and then spraying, this poor kid gets into the water, right?
[02:21:20.847 --> 02:21:23.089]  And this kid's got all these chemicals on him all day long.
[02:21:24.429 --> 02:21:25.450]  I'm not an EPA.
[02:21:25.791 --> 02:21:27.052]  I can't stand the EPA.
[02:21:27.072 --> 02:21:28.173]  I think they're a total joke.
[02:21:28.774 --> 02:21:31.817]  But the EPA came out and they said these things were safe.
[02:21:32.978 --> 02:21:33.159]  Hmm.
[02:21:33.899 --> 02:21:34.100]  Yeah.
[02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:35.241]  Okay.
[02:21:35.361 --> 02:21:36.382]  Everybody says they're safe.
[02:21:36.422 --> 02:21:38.985]  The FDA, it's actually classified as a drug.
[02:21:39.165 --> 02:21:41.127]  Everybody says these are safe for the environment.
[02:21:41.147 --> 02:21:42.008]  They're totally safe.
[02:21:42.048 --> 02:21:43.350]  And I'm not an environment nut.
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:54.582]  But what I did notice was, as the rates of cancer increased, it went from like 1 in 100,000, okay, when we were all out in the sun enjoying ourselves.
[02:21:55.163 --> 02:22:01.284]  And granted, we were wearing a lot more clothes because, you know, going around half naked really wasn't, you know, the thing to do.
[02:22:02.084 --> 02:22:04.645]  But at the same time, we did spend a lot of time in the sun.
[02:22:05.905 --> 02:22:07.506]  And so it went from 1 in 100,000 all the way up to about 43 in 100,000.
[02:22:07.345 --> 02:22:10.585]  all the way up to about 43 in 100,000.
[02:22:10.585 --> 02:22:13.564]  That's a lot.
[02:22:13.564 --> 02:22:16.764]   And I noticed that in some of the states like Florida and Arizona,
[02:22:16.764 --> 02:22:21.325]   it was actually, the rates are actually, they're not super high, okay?
[02:22:21.628 --> 02:22:24.214]  Kind of interesting because you have a lot of sun in these areas.
[02:22:24.938 --> 02:22:30.341]  But I also noticed along the way that I had cancers in places that the sun wasn't.
[02:22:30.841 --> 02:22:31.722]  Well, how could that be?
[02:22:32.202 --> 02:22:34.483]  So a lot of people have questions about these things.
[02:22:34.864 --> 02:22:40.387]  And I would have to say, go back to the rates of cancer when it exploded.
[02:22:40.827 --> 02:22:44.309]  And that was in the 70s when they said, you know, start using sunscreen.
[02:22:45.009 --> 02:22:47.811]  Also zinc oxide, a lot of benzene.
[02:22:48.251 --> 02:22:51.933]  That was the chemical responsible, they said, for causing skin cancer, right?
[02:22:52.620 --> 02:22:55.542]  Also, they had a couple of different ones, actually.
[02:22:55.562 --> 02:23:08.253]  There's like a list of these, and you can do your own research, but oxybenzone, all of these different things inside these sunscreens are actually really toxic, and they think they're actually causing cancers.
[02:23:09.597 --> 02:23:14.001]  Are we doing things to actually cause cancer thinking that we're blocking out the ultraviolet?
[02:23:14.321 --> 02:23:14.561]  Hmm.
[02:23:14.962 --> 02:23:20.527]  So you should be spending about at least 20 to 30 minutes in the sun without anything on you.
[02:23:20.567 --> 02:23:23.990]  And as you start to get a little pink, maybe get out of the sun or get a hat.
[02:23:24.290 --> 02:23:26.772]  But I don't think I'd slather myself up with chemicals anymore.
[02:23:27.093 --> 02:23:28.794]  I think it's causing more cancer than we think.
[02:23:28.834 --> 02:23:32.838]  And that's coming from somebody who's actually had skin cancers removed.
[02:23:33.618 --> 02:23:35.400]  I'm just saying you might want to watch it a little bit.
[02:23:35.990 --> 02:23:36.231]  Hmm.
[02:23:36.932 --> 02:23:40.299]  And get some good, good vitamin D. This is the time to do it.
[02:23:40.319 --> 02:23:40.940]  This is the window.
[02:23:41.041 --> 02:23:41.742]  I'll be right back.
[02:23:41.802 --> 02:23:43.766]  I'm Kate Dally for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:43.887 --> 02:23:44.368]  Be right back.
[02:23:45.388 --> 02:23:46.810]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:46.830 --> 02:23:50.153]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[02:23:50.573 --> 02:23:52.354]  So glad to be with you.
[02:23:52.435 --> 02:23:57.079]  I hope you're actually having a fun summer, despite the crap fest that we're living under.
[02:23:57.639 --> 02:23:59.020]  It's interesting.
[02:23:59.081 --> 02:23:59.921]  I saw De Niro.
[02:24:00.242 --> 02:24:01.222]  Ugh, De Niro.
[02:24:01.383 --> 02:24:02.424]  Forfeit to De Niro.
[02:24:02.844 --> 02:24:06.647]  I saw him on TV saying that Biden was just doing the best he could do.
[02:24:06.787 --> 02:24:09.690]  King Frodlot's doing the best he can do with the situation.
[02:24:10.351 --> 02:24:11.352]  You mean the one he created?
[02:24:13.036 --> 02:24:20.842]  Anyway, I go back to summer lives because we're told so many and I actually had to pick a few because it's that many, it's that bad.
[02:24:21.823 --> 02:24:25.966]  But ask yourself this question as I was just talking about sunscreen.
[02:24:27.107 --> 02:24:31.050]  If sunscreen helps, why didn't the cancer rate ever come down?
[02:24:31.450 --> 02:24:32.851]  Why did it just keep going up?
[02:24:33.852 --> 02:24:39.436]  Because in the press, all they ever do is say, oh, we've extended the life of skin cancer patients.
[02:24:40.188 --> 02:24:47.191]  They live five years longer, or the ones back in the 70s wouldn't have lived as long as they do now because of Pharma-Kia.
[02:24:47.611 --> 02:24:48.471]  I just call it Pharma-Kia.
[02:24:48.491 --> 02:24:50.212]  Might as well just go right to Sorcery.
[02:24:50.232 --> 02:24:51.673]  But anyway, Pharma-Kia.
[02:24:51.773 --> 02:24:52.513]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:24:53.093 --> 02:24:54.554]  So, why didn't it help?
[02:24:55.634 --> 02:25:03.357]  If everybody thinks it helps, and everybody's standing there with their ginormous can of sunscreen, why didn't the rate ever go down?
[02:25:03.377 --> 02:25:04.958]  Because it really hasn't.
[02:25:05.338 --> 02:25:06.098]  It's only gone up.
[02:25:06.979 --> 02:25:12.755]   And if it's only gone up since the 70s when they started recommending it, I think somebody needs to make some sort of correlation.
[02:25:13.656 --> 02:25:14.116]  And they are.
[02:25:14.556 --> 02:25:30.149]  Dr. Mercola, one of my favorites, he talked about the fact that the Cancer Society has been bought by cosmetics giants like Neutrogena for $200,000 with the supposed goal of helping to educate the public about the importance of sunscreen.
[02:25:30.810 --> 02:25:36.034]  But in reality, it's just a marketing ploy for Neutrogena, which will help them increase their sunscreen sales by millions.
[02:25:36.534 --> 02:25:37.515]  This is how it works.
[02:25:38.255 --> 02:25:38.836]  Isn't that sad?
[02:25:39.571 --> 02:25:49.279]  They get to even put the ACS logo on their advertising because they can say, well, you know, because of the agreements they made really for profit, we're the ones that get stung.
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:26:03.372]  And in 2014, they came out and they said, uh, consumer reports advise parents to avoid spraying their kids up, um, with, uh, sunscreen because you know, the motto less is more, no, no, no more is more, more is more.
[02:26:03.972 --> 02:26:07.055]  And they're spraying their kids continuously through the day too.
[02:26:07.947 --> 02:26:09.007]  Maybe not so smart.
[02:26:09.128 --> 02:26:14.390]  Maybe just spend a little less time outside, but when you are outside, get some actual vitamin D in your system.
[02:26:14.690 --> 02:26:21.012]  Our vitamin D levels are really low, and we also had a vaccination program in America that started in the 70s.
[02:26:21.832 --> 02:26:22.293]  Interesting.
[02:26:23.133 --> 02:26:26.814]  So as our immune systems were going in the tanker, right?
[02:26:28.155 --> 02:26:31.836]  We have all of these different kinds of cancers shooting up.
[02:26:32.797 --> 02:26:32.917]  Hmm.
[02:26:32.937 --> 02:26:34.417]  I wonder if there's a correlation.
[02:26:35.918 --> 02:26:36.338]  Interesting.
[02:26:37.359 --> 02:26:46.093]  All right, let's talk about ethanol for just a moment because everybody's noticing that, A, you go to the gas station, the gas doesn't really smell strong like gas used to.
[02:26:47.856 --> 02:26:49.539]  You aren't getting the mileage you used to.
[02:26:50.801 --> 02:26:51.302]  Why is that?
[02:26:52.503 --> 02:26:59.667]  Well, Eric Peters-Ottos, I love Eric because he's a libertarian and a car expert and I've had him, I've actually interviewed him before and he's amazing.
[02:27:00.207 --> 02:27:07.431]  But he was answering this question to somebody who was asking him about the watered-down ethanol that we seem to love in our country now.
[02:27:07.751 --> 02:27:09.232]  No, no one loves it, actually.
[02:27:09.291 --> 02:27:13.572]   just the fraud a lot administration and who's behind fraud a lot decided that
[02:27:13.572 --> 02:27:18.730]   they wanted to implement a very high level of ethanol that isn't so good for
[02:27:18.730 --> 02:27:22.931]   our cars. So older cars he said like yours or mine were built before the
[02:27:22.931 --> 02:27:26.850]   government began to adulterate gas and water down its energy content with
[02:27:26.850 --> 02:27:34.091]   ethanol and when you put E10 90% gas 10% ethanol in a tank like yours and now
[02:27:34.091 --> 02:27:40.251]   it's 15% okay you're feeding it a lean fuel mixture and the only way to correct
[02:27:40.251 --> 02:27:45.131]   this is to reject the carburetor and stop using E10 or find an adulterated
[02:27:45.131 --> 02:27:47.388]   gas Good advice.
[02:27:48.427 --> 02:27:59.934]  He also says, another problem with ethanol in older vehicles designed before it became common practice, you know, to water it down, is that alcohol is very, very corrosive.
[02:28:00.434 --> 02:28:06.878]  And I had this suspicion because, you know, it takes like 20, 25 years for people to catch on to new ideas.
[02:28:06.918 --> 02:28:09.080]  How long did it take us to get computers in our homes?
[02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:09.660]  About 25 years.
[02:28:09.700 --> 02:28:09.800]  Okay?
[02:28:11.423 --> 02:28:13.244]  We're not very quick on the uptake.
[02:28:13.284 --> 02:28:16.785]  It took a decade to get people even into Facebook, okay?
[02:28:16.845 --> 02:28:19.065]  Even to check it out because everybody started going there.
[02:28:19.145 --> 02:28:20.786]  But it takes a significant amount of time.
[02:28:21.446 --> 02:28:28.588]  But they really want their asinine electric cars to become the car, right?
[02:28:29.008 --> 02:28:31.709]  And they do want to get rid of an entire industry.
[02:28:31.869 --> 02:28:33.669]  But how do you do that when everyone has cars?
[02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:36.450]  Do you just ruin them?
[02:28:37.690 --> 02:28:39.831]  That would make it a lot faster, right?
[02:28:41.147 --> 02:28:56.636]  And there's no way, right, to fix that, because all of the gas, not all, so I'm going to give you a website to go to, to get gas that has not been watered down with ethanol, and you can find a gas station near you that hasn't done it yet, and save your car.
[02:28:57.116 --> 02:29:07.823]  Because cars like yours and mine, and others made, you know, before the mid-late, you know, 1890s, he says, do not have fuel systems designed to safely handle alcohol doused gas.
[02:29:08.122 --> 02:29:12.282]  It ruins the carburetor parts, it ruins plastic parts.
[02:29:12.282 --> 02:29:15.563]  It really, really, really ruins a lot of different things.
[02:29:15.563 --> 02:29:21.163]   And so the steel fuel tanks and the lines are really vulnerable to internal corrosion.
[02:29:21.163 --> 02:29:25.481]   And the rust flakes will eventually flake off and go downstream right into your carburetor.
[02:29:25.481 --> 02:29:32.762]   So rubber parts, accelerator pumps, rubber fuel lines, he says, get a new fuel pump right now.
[02:29:32.762 --> 02:29:35.322]   He says, if you haven't replaced it, get a new one right now
[02:29:35.961 --> 02:29:39.002]  because it's probably ruining the seal, he's pretty sure.
[02:29:39.002 --> 02:29:43.561]  And then also just maybe update some of the parts.
[02:29:43.561 --> 02:29:45.881]  He's replaced some of the parts in his own cars.
[02:29:45.881 --> 02:29:48.602]  And you can find out more at ericpetersmotors.com.
[02:29:48.789 --> 02:29:56.395]  But I absolutely love him because he gave out a website called pure-gas.org, pure-gas.org.
[02:29:56.795 --> 02:30:08.784]  And this website helps you find gas pumps in your area, in your city, and by the state that actually have gas that is not infused at this high level of ethanol that we're having to deal with now.
[02:30:09.324 --> 02:30:11.665]  And you probably noticed you're not getting the mileage.
[02:30:12.125 --> 02:30:16.046]  One thing the people in my family noticed is, yeah, the mileage was way down.
[02:30:16.106 --> 02:30:19.467]  You're not getting out of a tank of gas what you would normally get.
[02:30:19.987 --> 02:30:26.889]  And so we had the mandates coming forth after the induction of the EPA in the 70s.
[02:30:27.409 --> 02:30:30.190]  You guys realize that was all built on a lie, right?
[02:30:31.250 --> 02:30:37.652]  A 1966 oil spill that was cleaning up itself, right, basically within five years would have cleaned up itself.
[02:30:38.371 --> 02:30:50.678]  They took that event off the shore of California and turned that into a 10,000 person at the start EPA that it only took them six months to put into place because they'd already had it ready to go.
[02:30:52.759 --> 02:30:55.161]  Government moves really fast when they want to.
[02:30:56.058 --> 02:30:59.461]  When they want to build a wall, but they don't want to build a wall, they never build a wall.
[02:30:59.801 --> 02:31:06.406]  But when they want to start a 10,000 group EPA to regulate the hell out of us, it's Denski.
[02:31:07.027 --> 02:31:08.548]  So yeah, great.
[02:31:08.988 --> 02:31:19.537]  Anyway, so the EPA did the Renewable Fuel Standard back in 78, and this is what started to force ethanol into the fuel supply.
[02:31:20.217 --> 02:31:23.380]  They knew they were going to ruin vehicles.
[02:31:24.321 --> 02:31:24.741]  They knew it.
[02:31:25.379 --> 02:31:29.922]  So go get gas where you can and where you can still buy 100% gasoline.
[02:31:30.042 --> 02:31:30.983]  You'll get more mileage.
[02:31:31.143 --> 02:31:32.203]  It'll be better on your car.
[02:31:32.864 --> 02:31:36.186]  And the website again was pure-gas.org.
[02:31:36.206 --> 02:31:49.214]  I think it's really helpful to know these things because right now as we fight back on all of this garbage and the definite implosion of our country under globalist communist, let's be real, globalist communist rule.
[02:31:50.402 --> 02:31:54.645]  We have to know how to fight back and what to do to save ourselves and our neighbors.
[02:31:54.765 --> 02:31:55.925]  And so, you know what?
[02:31:56.005 --> 02:32:02.309]  This is one way that we can really get on board and actually do something to help right now, every single day.
[02:32:02.549 --> 02:32:10.033]  There's a lot more we can do because the fight's going to look very, very different on a lot of different landscapes as we move forward.
[02:32:10.173 --> 02:32:12.595]  It's not going to look like Patriot Front, I'll tell you that much.
[02:32:13.593 --> 02:32:14.794]  It's not going to look like that.
[02:32:14.814 --> 02:32:16.535]  Be a little more stealthy.
[02:32:16.835 --> 02:32:21.978]  Be a little more underground because these people really want to gaslight us out.
[02:32:22.198 --> 02:32:22.738]  I'll be right back.
[02:32:22.798 --> 02:32:23.979]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[02:32:24.019 --> 02:32:24.800]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:32:24.820 --> 02:32:28.121]  I have so much more to give you on summer lies.
[02:32:28.542 --> 02:32:28.922]  Stay tuned.
[02:32:29.282 --> 02:32:31.263]  Hi there, back with you on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:31.343 --> 02:32:32.683]  So happy to be joining you today.
[02:32:32.883 --> 02:32:37.345]  I'm Kate Delly, your guest host for this hour, and we're talking about summer lies.
[02:32:37.825 --> 02:32:41.466]  And I mean some whoppers, some things we've never had to deal with in the past.
[02:32:41.586 --> 02:32:46.548]  I know you're kind of craving like the summers from the 70s and the 80s, right?
[02:32:46.608 --> 02:32:47.348]  Right about now?
[02:32:47.368 --> 02:32:48.329]  I am.
[02:32:48.889 --> 02:32:50.049]  I know, I seriously am.
[02:32:50.250 --> 02:32:50.630]  It's tough.
[02:32:52.182 --> 02:32:56.764]  And it's tough to see, as I was just talking about, like the renewable fuel standard.
[02:32:57.784 --> 02:33:00.246]  You're not going to see Republicans go up against this.
[02:33:01.246 --> 02:33:02.166]  I am a Republican.
[02:33:02.246 --> 02:33:03.927]  I'm a registered Republican in my state.
[02:33:05.188 --> 02:33:06.328]  But I know what a farce it is.
[02:33:07.469 --> 02:33:11.430]  I know that we have two parties working for the destruction of America right now.
[02:33:11.450 --> 02:33:12.651]  I mean, let's be honest, right?
[02:33:13.451 --> 02:33:14.612]  They're not going to do anything about it.
[02:33:14.692 --> 02:33:18.734]  This is why every single bad law, every single thing that they try to do, okay?
[02:33:20.411 --> 02:33:21.392]  Never gets taken away.
[02:33:21.432 --> 02:33:30.182]  In 120 years, we've never ever seen government when party A or party B's in, and party A or party B is the good guy or the bad guy.
[02:33:30.322 --> 02:33:35.888]  When good guy or bad guy gets in, they don't reverse anything that the other team put into place.
[02:33:36.629 --> 02:33:38.651]  They just complain a lot and use a lot of scapegoats.
[02:33:39.161 --> 02:33:40.382]  But you're not going to see anything happen.
[02:33:40.662 --> 02:33:48.607]  Just like you're not going to see our dear Republicans go, ooh, election fraud, or hey, the economy, or hey, gas prices.
[02:33:49.227 --> 02:33:55.251]  Everyone puts their head in the sand, gets their paycheck, probably from pharma, and then goes to sleep and tells you they're working hard.
[02:33:55.271 --> 02:33:56.432]  I always love that phrase.
[02:33:56.892 --> 02:33:57.873]  I'm working hard.
[02:33:58.553 --> 02:33:59.014]  No, you're not.
[02:33:59.314 --> 02:34:00.835]  You're just taking a paycheck to shut up.
[02:34:01.035 --> 02:34:01.635]  That's what you're doing.
[02:34:03.470 --> 02:34:06.751]  We have that, and then we also have those arrests that we talked about.
[02:34:07.231 --> 02:34:07.751]  The arrests.
[02:34:07.851 --> 02:34:08.632]  Why the arrests?
[02:34:08.732 --> 02:34:09.572]  Why do they want that?
[02:34:09.632 --> 02:34:11.693]  They want to be able to paint a picture of us.
[02:34:11.753 --> 02:34:13.653]  They want to be able to January 6 us.
[02:34:14.293 --> 02:34:17.094]  And that is to trump up charges, right?
[02:34:17.494 --> 02:34:23.016]  And to make it look like we're the violent thugs, like Antifa, like a soft Antifa.
[02:34:24.096 --> 02:34:25.337]  Problem is, is that we're not.
[02:34:26.377 --> 02:34:27.557]  So they have to lie to do it.
[02:34:27.777 --> 02:34:29.578]  They actually have to create groups to do it.
[02:34:30.245 --> 02:34:38.132]  And that's my message for all of the groups from the Feds and from the CIA that have to put out lies in order to entrap people.
[02:34:38.472 --> 02:34:39.313]  How sad are they?
[02:34:39.934 --> 02:34:45.418]  What treasonous little thugs are they that have to lie to entrap?
[02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:47.000]  Sick.
[02:34:47.020 --> 02:34:48.541]  It's a sick game they're playing.
[02:34:49.102 --> 02:34:53.946]  Problem is they don't realize they're subject to the same government that they're helping to create and empower.
[02:34:54.687 --> 02:34:55.327]  That's the problem.
[02:34:57.935 --> 02:35:00.236]  I also had an audience member ask me, you know, what is it?
[02:35:00.717 --> 02:35:01.657]  Why aren't people fighting?
[02:35:03.198 --> 02:35:03.839]  Good question.
[02:35:04.119 --> 02:35:05.440]  What does that fight look like, though?
[02:35:06.340 --> 02:35:10.983]  We had to have a physical fight in order to get this land, in order to get the United States.
[02:35:12.084 --> 02:35:15.026]  But that doesn't always mean that everything has to be done that way.
[02:35:15.286 --> 02:35:16.687]  We already have the Constitution.
[02:35:17.167 --> 02:35:18.187]  We already have this country.
[02:35:18.948 --> 02:35:21.409]  So what is the fake fight or what does the fight mean now?
[02:35:21.469 --> 02:35:23.451]  Not fake fight, but what does the fight mean now?
[02:35:24.231 --> 02:35:25.392]  It doesn't mean fake fighting.
[02:35:26.158 --> 02:35:29.720]  It means real fighting, but in a much stealthier way.
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.501]  Are you preparing for what's coming?
[02:35:32.802 --> 02:35:40.647]  Are you basically taking steps to ensure that your family can eat, have a vehicle, have gas, have all of these things?
[02:35:40.927 --> 02:35:42.028]  Are you ensuring that?
[02:35:42.168 --> 02:35:46.050]  Are you basically setting forth a people's reset?
[02:35:46.371 --> 02:35:50.053]  Not their great rate reset, no, but the people's reset.
[02:35:51.693 --> 02:36:04.947]  Somebody asked me, you know, why all the companies are jumping on board for the June, the June-a-thon of, I call it the June-a-thon, Go Sodom, you know, basically month.
[02:36:05.148 --> 02:36:05.468]  Okay.
[02:36:06.369 --> 02:36:08.972]  And I said, because that's how they're going to get money in the future.
[02:36:09.921 --> 02:36:16.486]  In the Great Reset, in order to have money as a company, in order to get loans, in order to get all these things, you have to sign on.
[02:36:16.726 --> 02:36:26.794]  You have to absolutely sign on and say that you will be all for inclusion, all for equality, even though equality looks really weird, not the kind of equality you're thinking.
[02:36:27.474 --> 02:36:30.737]  And if they don't go, go Sodom!
[02:36:30.817 --> 02:36:35.260]  If they're not all on board, they don't get to maybe bank in the future.
[02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:37.001]  Maybe they can't process payments.
[02:36:37.342 --> 02:36:38.342]  Maybe they can't get loans.
[02:36:38.382 --> 02:36:39.123]  Maybe they can't grow.
[02:36:39.890 --> 02:36:45.574]  So everybody's going all in on paper and making it look like, hey, our company is all in.
[02:36:45.895 --> 02:36:50.378]  Man, we are going to toe the line because we never saw companies do that before.
[02:36:50.538 --> 02:36:55.942]  They never got politically agendized before, but now it's in the great reset.
[02:36:55.982 --> 02:36:56.923]  It's all for the cash.
[02:36:57.143 --> 02:36:58.765]  So they have to look like they're doing this.
[02:36:59.505 --> 02:37:01.006]  Just like, um, you know, it's funny.
[02:37:01.026 --> 02:37:04.269]  It's like, uh, it reminds me of the Iowa governor, right?
[02:37:04.569 --> 02:37:05.750]  What a mess, hot mess.
[02:37:06.854 --> 02:37:12.737]  Basically, a couple of months ago saying, hey, we're gonna offer gasoline with higher blends of ethanol.
[02:37:13.257 --> 02:37:16.479]  We're gonna boost the state's biofuels industry.
[02:37:17.099 --> 02:37:18.260]  Hmm, that's interesting.
[02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:20.361]  And tout a cheaper fuel option.
[02:37:20.401 --> 02:37:22.862]  That's how it was presented in the press, okay?
[02:37:23.963 --> 02:37:32.447]  But the law also includes tax credits, ooh, money, for higher blends of ethanol, for pushing this on your customers.
[02:37:33.088 --> 02:37:33.828]  How sad is that?
[02:37:34.645 --> 02:37:41.648]  They also said it would tweak Iowa's renewable fuel infrastructure program to provide more generous cost sharing.
[02:37:42.068 --> 02:37:43.389]  That means people are getting a paycheck.
[02:37:43.869 --> 02:37:49.211]  For smaller gas stations that want to use the state grant program.
[02:37:49.711 --> 02:37:53.873]  Here, little city, have some cash to further this agenda.
[02:37:54.153 --> 02:37:55.333]  It's how it's always done.
[02:37:55.793 --> 02:37:56.934]  And we all know this, right?
[02:37:57.574 --> 02:38:01.096]  If you're watching InfoWars and you watch the Alex Jones Show, you know this.
[02:38:01.156 --> 02:38:01.976]  I'm preaching to the choir.
[02:38:03.024 --> 02:38:06.446]  A lot of people out there don't know it because they can't see what's coming.
[02:38:07.187 --> 02:38:13.551]  The art of being an American is to be able to see what's coming and to prepare for it and to be able to fight it effectively.
[02:38:14.432 --> 02:38:14.752]  Okay?
[02:38:15.253 --> 02:38:25.520]  If these people are constantly outed, if all of the election fraud is outed, if these things are constantly put into the light, it's a great way to fight what's happening.
[02:38:26.468 --> 02:38:32.292]  They have a lot of minions that have to carry out the plans in order for them to work, and they have to do it for a paycheck.
[02:38:32.753 --> 02:38:37.296]  So small businesses should be saying no to these grants, no to these strings.
[02:38:37.736 --> 02:38:43.160]  That's a great way to fight, to fight this system that they want to implement, these globalist communists.
[02:38:43.701 --> 02:38:43.861]  Okay?
[02:38:44.551 --> 02:38:46.712]  If we don't do that, then we're suckered in.
[02:38:46.932 --> 02:38:53.373]  If we keep wearing a mask two and a half years later, like a total moron, we are suckering into that.
[02:38:53.433 --> 02:38:55.114]  We're saying, yeah, we believe you.
[02:38:55.494 --> 02:38:58.534]  We're in fear, even though no one around us is dropping dead.
[02:38:58.854 --> 02:39:01.295]  We're in fear, so we continue to wear the mask.
[02:39:02.435 --> 02:39:09.777]  Every single time we go along with this agenda, every single time we play along and act like we believe in it, it gives them power and strength.
[02:39:10.399 --> 02:39:13.700]  And then more people jump on, but it can also work in the reverse too.
[02:39:14.140 --> 02:39:16.221]  And the people need to have their own reset.
[02:39:16.881 --> 02:39:23.784]  So right now as you're preparing, are you basically storing up batteries for your car, spark plugs, brake rotors?
[02:39:23.964 --> 02:39:27.145]  Are you working on getting a set of tires put aside?
[02:39:28.146 --> 02:39:32.607]  All of those things right now, besides food storage, I would absolutely work on.
[02:39:32.767 --> 02:39:37.189]  I would also go into Alex Jones Store and buy the supplements in bulk.
[02:39:37.842 --> 02:39:45.947]  Because with winter coming and with the fall coming, the summer is a great time to get it right now before all the shortages really start to kick in.
[02:39:46.328 --> 02:39:49.410]  And then it's really hard to get all kinds of things right on our shelves.
[02:39:49.930 --> 02:39:58.876]  So right now as everyone's trying to vacation and they're trying to get on the airplanes because there's no masks, what a joke, we need to be preparing.
[02:39:59.835 --> 02:40:01.295]  And this is a great lesson that's learned.
[02:40:01.335 --> 02:40:05.757]  You know, we have all of these different food companies going by the wayside.
[02:40:05.917 --> 02:40:09.678]  Smithfields, JBS Foods, it's China owned, okay?
[02:40:09.978 --> 02:40:12.799]  And all of a sudden they're closing up shop.
[02:40:13.479 --> 02:40:17.580]  And they're also not buying calves to stock the feedlots.
[02:40:18.540 --> 02:40:19.761]  What does that translate to?
[02:40:20.221 --> 02:40:26.083]  That translates to this time next year, not having the food or having the food be so expensive you can't eat it.
[02:40:26.783 --> 02:40:27.343]  That's a problem.
[02:40:29.176 --> 02:40:33.079]  Right now, it's already expensive enough that you can't afford a lot of things.
[02:40:33.939 --> 02:40:36.241]  Can you imagine what it's going to be like this time next year?
[02:40:36.261 --> 02:40:43.566]  Because right now, they're not preparing, they're not doing things to have that food supply keep coming the way it's been coming.
[02:40:44.207 --> 02:40:56.936]  So with JBS Foods closing up shops in different areas, with local kill plants are hard to start up because you have to have FDA approval, that's not coming easily down the pike, right?
[02:40:58.374 --> 02:41:00.675]  Um, so we have a lot of problems in this area.
[02:41:00.715 --> 02:41:07.278]  We also have, um, if you look back to 2019, they had 10 incidences of fires.
[02:41:08.099 --> 02:41:11.040]  Now, 10 fires in a year, okay, I could go with that.
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:14.061]  I could say, yeah, that's a coincidence for the coincidence theorists out there.
[02:41:14.101 --> 02:41:14.902]  That's a coincidence.
[02:41:16.322 --> 02:41:17.183]  Almost 100 now?
[02:41:17.203 --> 02:41:17.183]  99?
[02:41:17.563 --> 02:41:20.845]  Something's wrong.
[02:41:22.465 --> 02:41:23.146]  That's planned.
[02:41:23.806 --> 02:41:24.966]  You and I both know it.
[02:41:25.447 --> 02:41:25.907]  It's planned.
[02:41:27.461 --> 02:41:32.543]  The destruction of our food supply comes from a lot of excuses and scapegoating and lies.
[02:41:33.023 --> 02:41:35.524]  But that's all King Fratelot knows, right?
[02:41:36.305 --> 02:41:40.706]  King Fratelot and his little group of cronies that are really running the show.
[02:41:41.007 --> 02:41:45.368]  Because you and I both know that Biden can't complete a sentence.
[02:41:47.089 --> 02:41:56.313]  So basically, you should be preparing not only for food storage, but toiletries, car parts, all the things you will not be able to get this time next year.
[02:41:57.369 --> 02:41:58.546]  Start preparing right now.
[02:41:59.446 --> 02:42:02.567]  And start kind of fighting this in that way.
[02:42:02.747 --> 02:42:05.388]  Make friends with a farmer and make friends with a mechanic.
[02:42:05.708 --> 02:42:07.729]  I promise you, it'll do you some good.
[02:42:08.249 --> 02:42:09.749]  I'm Kate Dally for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:09.829 --> 02:42:10.750]  I will be right back.
[02:42:10.770 --> 02:42:11.330]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:42:11.610 --> 02:42:13.290]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:13.350 --> 02:42:17.412]  So glad you're tuned in today and hopefully we're all learning something together.
[02:42:17.432 --> 02:42:27.475]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com and I do a daily show and I'm wrapped in all these headlines every day.
[02:42:28.095 --> 02:42:30.617]  There was a headline, curiously, that just came out.
[02:42:30.797 --> 02:42:32.878]  Biden, I can't make this up.
[02:42:32.918 --> 02:42:35.080]  This was on Yahoo of all places.
[02:42:35.740 --> 02:42:37.261]  So mainstream as they get.
[02:42:38.162 --> 02:42:44.206]  Biden to unveil plan for next pandemic while seeking $88 billion in funds.
[02:42:45.747 --> 02:42:46.427]  Next pandemic.
[02:42:46.848 --> 02:42:49.029]  I'm sorry, who's trying to come after us?
[02:42:50.790 --> 02:42:52.031]  Who's trying to do that to us?
[02:42:52.371 --> 02:42:53.332]  They never named the enemy.
[02:42:54.473 --> 02:42:54.593]  Ever.
[02:42:57.597 --> 02:42:58.357]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:42:58.697 --> 02:43:00.538]  Already planning, putting it out in the press.
[02:43:00.598 --> 02:43:01.938]  Oh yes, we're going to have another one.
[02:43:02.458 --> 02:43:03.659]  We didn't even have the first one.
[02:43:04.419 --> 02:43:06.380]  Remember, no cemetery was ever built in the year 2020.
[02:43:08.360 --> 02:43:09.020]  Or added on to.
[02:43:10.021 --> 02:43:11.601]  Oh, I thought we had 500,000 extra?
[02:43:11.681 --> 02:43:12.821]  Oh yeah, not allowed to say that.
[02:43:13.001 --> 02:43:13.221]  Okay.
[02:43:13.862 --> 02:43:16.382]  Biden to unveil plan for next pandemic.
[02:43:17.703 --> 02:43:17.943]  Neat.
[02:43:18.643 --> 02:43:19.943]  Anyway, so how do you fight it?
[02:43:20.163 --> 02:43:22.024]  Because we were just talking about what kind of fight.
[02:43:23.104 --> 02:43:29.006]  So I think people think it's either got to be a violent fight in the streets or it's got to be or people are doing nothing.
[02:43:29.246 --> 02:43:30.247]  But I don't agree with that.
[02:43:30.267 --> 02:43:36.989]  I think there's a lot of people trying to really fight for the mind right now, because I think that's what's under assault.
[02:43:37.889 --> 02:43:46.773]  Right now, if people were exposing their government like they should be and realizing who the enemy is, and honestly, isn't that why talk shows exist?
[02:43:47.193 --> 02:43:50.634]  We're trying to point out who the enemy is over and over and over again.
[02:43:51.618 --> 02:43:58.220]  Okay, it's too many people love and believe their government, even though in history that's never worked out well.
[02:43:59.040 --> 02:43:59.820]  Remember the Haldimor?
[02:44:00.860 --> 02:44:02.161]  Created food crisis.
[02:44:03.761 --> 02:44:05.141]  Yeah, starved to death.
[02:44:05.862 --> 02:44:07.222]  So it's never worked out well.
[02:44:07.982 --> 02:44:16.744]  But there's a kind of fight right now because we have the Constitution already in place, because we have this country, that we need to nail, that we're going to be responsible for doing.
[02:44:16.824 --> 02:44:19.405]  And that is the war for the mind.
[02:44:20.310 --> 02:44:23.231]  So there's so many lies that are being told right now.
[02:44:24.332 --> 02:44:28.194]  And as the enemy isn't named, right?
[02:44:28.214 --> 02:44:31.476]  But we know who the enemy is.
[02:44:31.896 --> 02:44:34.877]  It's interesting how the messages are getting really screwed up.
[02:44:35.678 --> 02:44:36.838]  Let me give you an example.
[02:44:37.799 --> 02:44:40.500]  My son, one of my sons, is an armed robber.
[02:44:42.001 --> 02:44:45.583]  Really, really, I mean, he's just going after banks left and right.
[02:44:45.983 --> 02:44:46.883]  Total armed robber.
[02:44:46.903 --> 02:44:48.164]  Okay?
[02:44:49.239 --> 02:44:50.140]  And he loves it.
[02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:51.060]  It's exhilarating.
[02:44:51.460 --> 02:44:53.722]  And it also makes him kind of sad, though.
[02:44:54.182 --> 02:44:54.382]  Yeah.
[02:44:54.762 --> 02:44:56.403]  Makes him kind of sad because he knows.
[02:44:56.443 --> 02:44:57.824]  I mean, I taught him right from wrong.
[02:44:58.564 --> 02:45:00.485]  And I taught him the good book.
[02:45:00.806 --> 02:45:02.547]  And he knows better, right?
[02:45:02.607 --> 02:45:03.887]  So I taught him right and wrong.
[02:45:04.768 --> 02:45:16.156]   But now I'm kind of figuring that I need to be one of those parents that worries that all of a sudden, if I don't go along with him being an armed robber, That I need to get on board.
[02:45:16.176 --> 02:45:17.917]  I need to actually promote it.
[02:45:18.217 --> 02:45:20.158]  I need to say, yes, I'm on board.
[02:45:20.178 --> 02:45:21.479]  Be an armed robber.
[02:45:21.519 --> 02:45:22.619]  It's amazing.
[02:45:23.279 --> 02:45:27.161]  Now, I know it's not amazing, but I'm going to say it's amazing.
[02:45:27.481 --> 02:45:28.962]  I'm going to tell you it's amazing.
[02:45:28.982 --> 02:45:30.843]  I'm going to lie to my kid.
[02:45:30.863 --> 02:45:33.204]  I'm going to say, yeah, it'll bring you lots of happiness in your life.
[02:45:33.244 --> 02:45:33.924]  It's awesome.
[02:45:35.276 --> 02:45:40.539]  It's interesting because as a parent, I used to be able to teach right from wrong, and my kids never worried if I loved them or not.
[02:45:40.559 --> 02:45:42.200]  You did it in a really loving, kind way.
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:44.942]  Nobody ever said you had to be mean about it.
[02:45:45.242 --> 02:45:45.882]  You just teach.
[02:45:46.823 --> 02:45:51.866]  But for some reason, we're to a place right now where everything goes.
[02:45:52.206 --> 02:45:53.947]  Chuck the Ten Commandments out the window.
[02:45:54.547 --> 02:45:55.908]  Let's just go to one commandment.
[02:45:56.048 --> 02:45:57.629]  It's called don't hurt people's feelings.
[02:45:58.309 --> 02:45:59.410]  And that will suffice.
[02:46:00.768 --> 02:46:02.009]  And so I thought, you know what?
[02:46:02.189 --> 02:46:05.271]  I should join groups that love armed robbery.
[02:46:05.391 --> 02:46:07.072]  And I should just be all on board.
[02:46:07.152 --> 02:46:09.214]  And I mean, all on board.
[02:46:09.634 --> 02:46:12.296]  I should have banners that say, I love armed robbery.
[02:46:12.316 --> 02:46:13.456]  I love it.
[02:46:14.257 --> 02:46:16.018]  And you can come to my house and tell me you're an armed robber.
[02:46:16.038 --> 02:46:17.199]  I'm not going to do anything about it.
[02:46:18.179 --> 02:46:18.360]  Ever.
[02:46:19.020 --> 02:46:20.141]  I'm not even going to tell you it's great.
[02:46:21.502 --> 02:46:23.663]  Those Ten Commandments can be really, really pesky.
[02:46:24.464 --> 02:46:29.367]  They can get in the way so much easier if I go about the route of just saying everything goes.
[02:46:31.044 --> 02:46:32.665]  Remember when Christ taught everything goes?
[02:46:33.206 --> 02:46:34.887]  Everything goes and just don't hurt feelings?
[02:46:35.288 --> 02:46:35.968]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[02:46:36.068 --> 02:46:36.689]  He didn't do that.
[02:46:38.230 --> 02:46:39.692]  So, here's the deal.
[02:46:40.973 --> 02:46:48.760]  There are a lot of messages out there that are problematic because they twist what's going on.
[02:46:49.680 --> 02:46:50.301]  They twist it.
[02:46:51.169 --> 02:47:12.565]  And so, when I'm looking at the world, and I'm seeing this month of June, and I'm seeing all the things that we're having to deal with right now, I see a lot of really good Christians, really good people, all of a sudden jump on board the train that everybody seems to be getting on, for a very small fraction of society that are armed robbers, okay?
[02:47:13.386 --> 02:47:17.109]  But they're all aboard the train, and they're all aboard the, you know what?
[02:47:18.283 --> 02:47:25.391]  Let's just go with anything goes and whatever choice you make, child, is completely incredible.
[02:47:25.611 --> 02:47:26.933]  You're awesome, right?
[02:47:27.694 --> 02:47:31.218]  And the thing we need the most right now is parenting.
[02:47:31.258 --> 02:47:31.938]  I realize that.
[02:47:32.719 --> 02:47:34.842]  But I think let's just jump aboard, right?
[02:47:35.042 --> 02:47:36.163]  Let's just make it happen.
[02:47:36.944 --> 02:47:41.932]   Let's just go all in for nothing ever being Wrong, everything being okay.
[02:47:42.433 --> 02:47:51.480]  And when I say wrong, I mean there are things I think that bring a lot of happiness and things that people might really struggle with when they're engaged in certain things.
[02:47:52.241 --> 02:47:58.646]  And I feel like as a society, we're sort of caving when we need all hands on deck.
[02:47:59.487 --> 02:48:12.640]   We need you more than ever before to be the person in that room that says, There's things that are right, there's things that are wrong, and there's things that might not bring you the kind of happiness you're looking at.
[02:48:13.221 --> 02:48:17.123]  But, still love ya, but I'm still here to teach.
[02:48:17.724 --> 02:48:18.824]  I'm still here to teach you.
[02:48:19.745 --> 02:48:27.569]  And I think one of the things we're gonna run up against is a lot more people kind of caving to this world and what's happening in it.
[02:48:27.629 --> 02:48:36.761]   And when you wonder why America became the America we have right now, Why our morals and values just don't seem to matter anymore as a nation?
[02:48:37.581 --> 02:48:44.243]  Once we lose that, once we lose that completely, we don't be, we're not America anymore.
[02:48:44.303 --> 02:48:47.444]  We're not this country because the country isn't about a piece of land.
[02:48:48.064 --> 02:48:50.685]  It's about what we stand for and who we stand up for.
[02:48:51.385 --> 02:48:51.685]  Isn't it?
[02:48:51.705 --> 02:48:53.405]  That's what I was always taught.
[02:48:54.586 --> 02:49:09.069]   So when the world is starting to cave and they're starting to go with these messages, What I find the most interesting is you have a situation where it starts out as one thing and then becomes another.
[02:49:09.089 --> 02:49:11.490]  A totally different thing.
[02:49:12.351 --> 02:49:17.635]  And they used it as a Trojan horse to try to get in and then present all kinds of things.
[02:49:18.776 --> 02:49:26.882]  There was an event in my state and this event was done on the notion for gay pride.
[02:49:27.631 --> 02:49:31.172]  The most interesting part about this, though, was that it wasn't that.
[02:49:31.372 --> 02:49:43.497]  It was people putting Satan blood on people and, you know, the exposed breasts and the and the twerking in front of kids and the total debauchery.
[02:49:43.537 --> 02:49:45.718]  And I thought, when did it go into that?
[02:49:46.278 --> 02:49:49.780]  Because there's so many people that aren't OK with that.
[02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:51.920]  They're not OK with that at all.
[02:49:52.741 --> 02:49:55.542]  But when did it segue into that and when did that become OK?
[02:49:57.094 --> 02:49:57.514]  I don't know.
[02:49:58.515 --> 02:50:09.880]  I know as a nation that when we seek to do good and when we seek to understand who to honor and who not to honor, that it's pretty clear what happens to us as a people.
[02:50:11.080 --> 02:50:11.580]  Am I right?
[02:50:12.241 --> 02:50:15.122]  So we need to be really careful about the messages.
[02:50:15.262 --> 02:50:17.303]  I see parents that cease to be parents.
[02:50:18.402 --> 02:50:25.228]  I see parents that are so afraid, they're so afraid to stand up that they become the friend mom.
[02:50:25.388 --> 02:50:26.328]  I call them froms.
[02:50:27.109 --> 02:50:28.370]  They're like a friend mom.
[02:50:28.410 --> 02:50:30.492]  They're no longer a mom.
[02:50:31.232 --> 02:50:41.541]  You go to your parents because you expect them to not lose their values and not lose their morals and to maybe be that guiding force in your life.
[02:50:42.501 --> 02:50:46.925]  The ones that'll tell you sometimes when, hey, that might not be the best path for you.
[02:50:47.711 --> 02:50:55.357]  But it seems like nowadays, we're kind of going all in on anything goes, because if you choose it, honey, you are remarkable.
[02:50:55.617 --> 02:50:58.440]  No matter what you choose, it's amazing.
[02:50:58.680 --> 02:51:00.181]  Haven't you heard that over and over again?
[02:51:00.221 --> 02:51:01.422]  My child's amazing.
[02:51:01.462 --> 02:51:02.002]  What did he do?
[02:51:02.022 --> 02:51:02.363]  Nothing.
[02:51:02.383 --> 02:51:03.303]  He's just amazing.
[02:51:05.165 --> 02:51:07.927]  If that's parenting in America, something's wrong.
[02:51:08.007 --> 02:51:09.849]  And I'm seeing more of it this summer.
[02:51:09.969 --> 02:51:12.771]  For some reason, I've been a lot of places this summer.
[02:51:12.851 --> 02:51:15.213]  And let me just tell you, I'm noticing this more and more and more.
[02:51:16.155 --> 02:51:18.237]  Parents ceasing to be parents.
[02:51:18.857 --> 02:51:26.823]  Parents stop holding the line, they stop teaching and they say, anything goes, knowing it's not true.
[02:51:28.264 --> 02:51:30.906]  Because as you can see in society, right?
[02:51:31.426 --> 02:51:36.430]  You understand when things aren't right with somebody, the depression, the sadness.
[02:51:37.551 --> 02:51:43.175]  And instead of looking at the depression and the sadness that things might be causing somebody, what do we do?
[02:51:43.395 --> 02:51:48.778]   We just say the answer is in, oh, they just They just need more love instead of being honest with them.
[02:51:50.299 --> 02:51:51.799]  I vote we go back to honesty.
[02:51:53.600 --> 02:51:57.002]  I vote that we go back to some morals and values as a country.
[02:51:57.603 --> 02:52:03.786]  And I vote that parents start to be parents again and start to be honest with their kids and toe that line.
[02:52:03.946 --> 02:52:05.067]  We need all hands on deck.
[02:52:05.447 --> 02:52:09.550]  We can't lose who we are to a bunch of lies.
[02:52:10.370 --> 02:52:12.051]  We're told enough lies, right?
[02:52:12.912 --> 02:52:15.153]  And so let's stand up for something important.
[02:52:16.075 --> 02:52:20.299]  Let's, you know, stand up with conviction.
[02:52:21.561 --> 02:52:22.441]  It's not a bad thing.
[02:52:23.222 --> 02:52:24.183]  And you can do it with love.
[02:52:24.844 --> 02:52:25.424]  But stand up.
[02:52:26.646 --> 02:52:29.308]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:52:29.408 --> 02:52:30.610]  So glad to be with you.
[02:52:31.030 --> 02:52:38.998]  And I hope that some of this helped you as far as kind of looking at the summer and deciphering through the many, many lies that were told because we're told so many.
[02:52:39.815 --> 02:52:41.016]  These are the ones I picked today.
[02:52:41.036 --> 02:52:43.038]  It's been really great spending some time with you.
[02:52:43.498 --> 02:52:44.879]  This is an attack on the world economy.
[02:52:45.239 --> 02:52:48.842]  That's the prime result we get out of this.
[02:52:48.982 --> 02:52:49.563]  We're gonna face.
[02:52:50.981 --> 02:52:53.123]  The economic problems that come from this and uncertainty.
[02:52:53.143 --> 02:52:54.904]  We're going to face military crises.
[02:52:54.924 --> 02:52:57.646]  We're going to face cultural and spiritual crises.
[02:52:57.686 --> 02:53:05.011]  And we're going to see the UN further throw third world populations at borders of the West and attempt to break the West.
[02:53:05.551 --> 02:53:07.613]  Suddenly, the world's going bankrupt.
[02:53:07.673 --> 02:53:09.114]  Suddenly, your savings are gone.
[02:53:09.314 --> 02:53:14.978]  The New World Order elite types are going to try to trigger a financial collapse.
[02:53:15.818 --> 02:53:17.700]  This is the mass culling.
[02:53:17.960 --> 02:53:20.322]  When the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[02:53:21.317 --> 02:53:44.180]  I could play you clip after clip for hours of going back 30 months ago, and 20 months ago, and 10 months ago, and a month ago, where I told you there'd be hyperinflation, I told you there'd be food shortages, I told you the price of food would explode, because it's an IMF, World Bank, globalist plan they've already carried out for decades in third world countries, and now they're doing it.
[02:53:44.784 --> 02:53:48.407]  Dyer new report forces US UK to change course on coronavirus strategy.
[02:53:48.727 --> 02:53:50.869]  Now you're going to be locked up for 18 months.
[02:53:51.550 --> 02:53:51.630]  Oh!
[02:53:53.001 --> 02:53:55.603]  That's gonna cause a depression within a month of this crap.
[02:53:56.003 --> 02:53:56.824]  But that's okay.
[02:53:57.164 --> 02:54:01.828]  Now the depression isn't the banker's fault or the politicians, it's all the virus.
[02:54:02.148 --> 02:54:05.030]  So now they can really screw you over.
[02:54:05.310 --> 02:54:15.938]  This has been the plan stated to cut off your carbon, to cut off your life, to cut off your mobility, to absolutely bring you down to below a third world status.
[02:54:16.298 --> 02:54:32.541]   And when you de-industrialize and you collapse the first world, just the estimates Put out by Russia and the United States, and Lord Monkton has his own, that if they did a 50% carbon cut like they wanted by 2025, they wanted the deal in place by 2008, didn't happen.
[02:54:35.199 --> 02:54:38.942]  That over a billion people would starve to death in the first decade.
[02:54:39.262 --> 02:54:42.884]  That's a b-b-b-b-b-b-billion!
[02:54:43.064 --> 02:54:48.088]  They've got a whole societal collapse program, how it brings down the hospitals and brings down the civilization.
[02:54:48.448 --> 02:54:52.091]  Then there's a collapse and then the general masses are starving to death.
[02:54:52.751 --> 02:55:01.978]  And so those that still have wealth that aren't part of the system are told, you've got to sign on and put your wealth into this to stabilize and save all these people that are dying and starving.
[02:55:02.599 --> 02:55:08.363]  And then basically you sign your wealth over to this big giant global wallet that they're going to be rolling out.
[02:55:08.884 --> 02:55:12.186]  And you and your whole family are in extreme danger of being murdered.
[02:55:12.727 --> 02:55:13.287]  Extreme danger.
[02:55:13.968 --> 02:55:17.183]   And It's not just from the virus they're going to release.
[02:55:17.863 --> 02:55:23.565]  It's from the collapse of civilization that's going to ensue that they're then going to organize to consolidate power.
[02:55:24.325 --> 02:55:41.668]  The only way to beat these people is to understand their game plan and to understand they've just started their inflationary system and to use the dollars you've got today to buy high quality storable food and other preparedness and survival items at low prices so that in the future you have what you need.
[02:55:41.968 --> 02:55:44.209]  That's how you beat these people.
