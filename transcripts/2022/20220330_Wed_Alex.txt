[00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:08.244]  I went and watched some of the Disney executive videos that were on Infowars.com where the executives got together and were like, we're going to get them!
[00:00:08.284 --> 00:00:09.885]  The children must be ours!
[00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:11.886]  We must queer them at age 5!
[00:00:11.947 --> 00:00:12.587]  These are quotes.
[00:00:12.607 --> 00:00:15.209]  Can you imagine if you were at a park?
[00:00:16.325 --> 00:00:23.767]  And there's a park bench over here and some tables and a barbecue pit and there's a family over there and you got your family, you're throwing the football back and forth.
[00:00:24.387 --> 00:00:34.090]  And then just a couple dudes walk up, a couple women, and they walk over and say, hi, we'd like to talk to your five-year-old daughter and your six-year-old son about sex and how they feel about that.
[00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.192]  We want to have a party with them and have them wear rainbow flags and dance and paint their nails and teach them about having sex with the same sex.
[00:00:40.572 --> 00:00:42.113]  You're ruining their innocence.
[00:00:42.153 --> 00:00:43.513]  That's not what goes on.
[00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.374]  And that's a stranger doing it.
[00:00:46.806 --> 00:01:03.080]  But now it's the schools going and getting the nerds and the autistic and the low-hanging fruit and then moving on to the rest of the children and destroying their innocence and then saying in that choir song and all the big statements at city councils and at Disney events, we're going to get your children and then we're gonna get you.
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.589]   They just busted over a hundred and thirty Disney employees in Orlando alone for child sex rings.
[00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.295]  They just busted the highest ranking civilian in the Pentagon in Afghanistan.
[00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:17.556]  It's come out, it's been suppressed.
[00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:18.877]  It's mainstream news.
[00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:22.621]  Running child rape rings and porn rings.
[00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:23.923]  Child porn rings.
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.084]  I have stacks today of government-run facilities raping children as young as five.
[00:01:30.564 --> 00:01:41.493]  I have mainstream German news reporting tens of thousands of children per city, CIA-run, with the psychiatry department of the CPS taking Christians' children and giving them to rape rings.
[00:01:41.513 --> 00:01:45.636]  I mean, you cannot make up the full magnitude of this.
[00:01:45.736 --> 00:01:59.347]   And then DeSantis calls out the demon in the room, the elephant in the room, the 80 trillion pound Satan, and says, In the bill I've got right here, you will not talk to children 5 to 8 about sex, period.
[00:01:59.346 --> 00:02:06.346]   From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:07.346 --> 00:02:22.346]  [Music]
[00:02:22.346 --> 00:02:24.346]  InfoWars.
[00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:25.464]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:39.846]   today. The young men and women who have volunteered to serve and protect their communities as
[00:02:39.846 --> 00:02:44.925]   members of the United States military have been under attack by their own government
[00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:46.165]  for over a century.
[00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:54.955]  Experimented on like laboratory animals with mustard gas, plutonium, Agent Orange, and depleted uranium.
[00:02:55.875 --> 00:03:00.760]  But what we are experiencing now is the final destruction of the entire U.S.
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.981]  military from within.
[00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:08.665]  Those with enough sense to refuse the gene therapy shots are being forced out of military service.
[00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:16.309]  Navy SEALs who refused the jab have been denied deployment and even denied permission to travel for medical treatment.
[00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.290]  But more than two-thirds of the entire U.S.
[00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.695]  military have chosen to receive this life-altering vaccine, which has now proven to be catastrophic.
[00:03:28.156 --> 00:03:31.799]  Attorney-at-law Todd Callender, who is representing the U.S.
[00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:39.146]  Navy SEALs vs. President Joe Biden, has recently reported an 1,100% increase in U.S.
[00:03:39.206 --> 00:03:43.350]  military deaths as a result of these mRNA injections.
[00:03:44.431 --> 00:03:48.555]  And based on their latest data, they expect this number to soon rise above 5,000%.
[00:03:51.037 --> 00:04:07.464]  A leaked military database from the Department of Defense shows us that while the public was being told that it's a crisis of the unvaccinated, the Defense Secretary and upper command knew 71% of all new cases were among the fully vaccinated.
[00:04:07.484 --> 00:04:13.866]  The Department of Defense knew what they were doing, and the proper charges are genocide.
[00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:19.989]  If you look at all of the documentation, Pfizer's documentation, we did mass spectrometry on their vials.
[00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:24.217]  They know what's in these things and in fact they even admit that they added an HIV protein.
[00:04:27.264 --> 00:04:28.825]  It's in all the scientific papers.
[00:04:28.845 --> 00:04:30.827]  What they didn't do is undo that.
[00:04:30.747 --> 00:04:35.206]   They couldn't slip these lipid nanoparticles, which are in fact little bombers that carry
[00:04:35.206 --> 00:04:42.547]   pathogenic proteins, to effectuate gene modification in the individual, gene therapy as they call
[00:04:42.547 --> 00:04:43.547]  it.
[00:04:43.547 --> 00:04:46.987]   In order to get those lipid nanoparticles past your cellular defense, your body's defense,
[00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:49.747]  they had to disarm your immune system.
[00:04:49.747 --> 00:04:51.367]  And they did that.
[00:04:51.367 --> 00:04:52.747]  It's in all the scientific papers.
[00:04:52.747 --> 00:04:54.266]  What they didn't do is undo that.
[00:04:54.266 --> 00:04:58.586]   And right now, they're coming to understand this, people are showing up HIV positive,
[00:04:58.611 --> 00:04:58.951]  That's right.
[00:04:58.991 --> 00:04:59.512]  That's correct.
[00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:03.971]   have no immune system left over whatsoever. There is no other way to characterize this
[00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:08.451]   other than intentional homicide, the unlawful taking of a human life, except that it's in
[00:05:08.451 --> 00:05:15.492]   large numbers, which makes it a genocide. A vaccine delivered AIDS epidemic. That's right.
[00:05:15.492 --> 00:05:27.170]  That's correct. Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:37.172]  [Music]
[00:05:37.172 --> 00:05:39.091]  Will you have U.S.
[00:05:39.188 --> 00:05:48.885]  Senators in both parties saying we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first, and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before, what do you think that makes the Russians do?
[00:05:49.165 --> 00:05:50.588]  Well, it makes them go into war mode.
[00:05:53.516 --> 00:05:55.037]  So I don't like them invading Ukraine.
[00:05:55.097 --> 00:05:58.480]  I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert.
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.124]  Only one level above that on their DEFCON, just like our system, and that's fire the weapons.
[00:06:04.105 --> 00:06:10.790]   And so now we have Democrats all over the news saying, let's just use Use nuclear weapons on Russia?
[00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.150]  Think of their ignorance.
[00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:22.434]  Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast with sea-launched missiles that would vaporize our cities within five minutes on average of being launched.
[00:06:23.014 --> 00:06:26.595]  Sea-launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach 5.
[00:06:26.895 --> 00:06:32.537]  Land-launched systems they can also launch from ships that are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down.
[00:06:33.077 --> 00:06:34.738]  And yes, the United States has those too.
[00:06:36.092 --> 00:06:39.213]  That's a Pentagon lie that Russia developed systems that we don't have.
[00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:40.754]  It's on record the U.S.
[00:06:40.814 --> 00:06:41.995]  has those systems.
[00:06:42.035 --> 00:06:47.077]  The point is it's called mutually assured destruction or mad for a reason.
[00:06:47.937 --> 00:06:51.159]  Because anyone that would violate the mad doctrine is insane.
[00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:54.400]  And you know, I'm on the side of not having a nuclear war.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.861]  Especially when Russia's not starting a fight with us.
[00:06:57.121 --> 00:07:03.144]  And especially after we just heard for years that everything happening in this country is run by Russia when that was all a giant lie.
[00:07:03.324 --> 00:07:05.025]  The globalists are the outside evil force.
[00:07:07.486 --> 00:07:21.257]  Across the world, top scientists are confirming that individuals taking the Pfizer and Moderna shots are developing rapid onset of what can only be described as vaccine-induced HIV AIDS.
[00:07:23.478 --> 00:07:29.883]  Dr. Zelenka will be joining us, as well as Reimer Fulmick coming up in the second and third hours today.
[00:07:30.384 --> 00:07:31.524]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:07:31.644 --> 00:07:35.988]  But first, the world has awoken to the left's operating system.
[00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:45.411]  Satanism, pedophilia, and just all around destructiveness in their hunger for the innocence of our children.
[00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:54.660]  Disney and others have come out and openly said they want to brainwash five-year-olds into the creed of pedophilia.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.063]  They want to destroy and literally rape their innocence, and they've attacked the wonderful governor.
[00:08:00.117 --> 00:08:00.738]  The Santas.
[00:08:01.318 --> 00:08:06.683]  But here is just last year, the San Francisco, quote, gay choir saying, we're coming for your children.
[00:08:06.703 --> 00:08:07.544]  We're going to get them.
[00:08:07.784 --> 00:08:08.725]  We're going to groom them.
[00:08:08.765 --> 00:08:09.365]  They're ours.
[00:08:09.445 --> 00:08:10.906]  They belong to us.
[00:08:10.947 --> 00:08:11.427]  Here it is.
[00:08:13.088 --> 00:08:15.330]  Convert your children.
[00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:19.014]  Someone's got to teach them not to hate.
[00:08:19.034 --> 00:08:23.157]  We're coming for them.
[00:08:22.977 --> 00:08:27.977]  We're coming for your children!
[00:08:27.977 --> 00:08:37.977]  We're coming for them!
[00:08:37.977 --> 00:08:43.977]   Your children will care about fairness and justice for others.
[00:08:43.977 --> 00:08:48.977]   Your children will work to convert all their sisters and brothers.
[00:08:48.977 --> 00:08:54.778]   Then soon we're almost certain The Gay Agenda is coming home.
[00:08:54.838 --> 00:08:55.619]  The Gay Agenda is here.
[00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:56.699]  But you don't have to worry.
[00:08:56.538 --> 00:09:05.178]   Converting you The gay agenda is coming home
[00:09:05.178 --> 00:09:12.057]   The gay agenda is here But you don't have to worry
[00:09:12.057 --> 00:09:17.258]   Because there's nothing wrong with standing by your side Get on board and hurry
[00:09:17.258 --> 00:09:22.619]   Because the world always needs a bit more pride But you don't have to worry
[00:09:22.619 --> 00:09:26.979]   Because there's nothing wrong with standing by your side ♪ I'm gonna get up on that hill ♪
[00:09:26.579 --> 00:09:35.579]   Because the world always seems a little bright Come on, try a little pride
[00:09:35.579 --> 00:09:40.579]   We'll convert your children Then we'll turn to you
[00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:45.579]   Giving all of the fear inside It's spring like you never knew
[00:09:45.579 --> 00:09:51.579]   Go and see San Francisco Go and turn up that disco
[00:09:51.579 --> 00:09:58.579]   You'll forget you were ever upset We'll convert your children
[00:09:58.579 --> 00:10:06.579]   And make an ally of the end Oh, make an ally of the end
[00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:15.579]  This is what war looks like in the year 2022.
[00:10:15.579 --> 00:10:25.579]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:10:16.869 --> 00:10:18.090]  They're coming for your energy.
[00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.991]  They're coming for your right to self-defense.
[00:10:20.571 --> 00:10:21.632]  They're coming for your housing.
[00:10:21.652 --> 00:10:22.812]  They're coming for your children.
[00:10:23.113 --> 00:10:24.793]  They're coming for your currency.
[00:10:25.074 --> 00:10:27.295]  They're coming for your soul.
[00:10:31.317 --> 00:10:33.118]  Oh, don't hate us, let us have gay marriage.
[00:10:33.278 --> 00:10:35.560]  And then, boom, we're coming for your children.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.620]  Your children belong to us.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:42.383]  And now, I was watching some of this last night, and I just couldn't watch it after I put my four-and-a-half-year-old daughter to bed.
[00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.525]  She's such a little sweetheart and so innocent and good.
[00:10:45.674 --> 00:10:47.015]  It must be protected and will be.
[00:10:49.037 --> 00:10:56.365]  I went and watched some of the Disney executive videos that were on Infowars.com where the executives got together and were like, we're going to get them!
[00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:57.986]  The children must be ours!
[00:10:58.066 --> 00:10:59.488]  We must queer them at age 5!
[00:11:00.048 --> 00:11:00.709]  These are quotes.
[00:11:00.729 --> 00:11:03.332]  Can you imagine if you were a park?
[00:11:04.448 --> 00:11:11.872]  And there's a park bench over here and some tables and a barbecue pit and there's a family over there and you got your family, you're throwing the football back and forth.
[00:11:12.492 --> 00:11:22.177]  And then just a couple dudes walk up, a couple women, and they walk over and say, hi, we'd like to talk to your five-year-old daughter and your six-year-old son about sex and how they feel about that.
[00:11:22.197 --> 00:11:28.320]  We want to have a party with them and have them wear rainbow flags and dance and paint their nails and teach them about having sex with the same sex.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.221]  You're ruining their innocence.
[00:11:30.281 --> 00:11:31.642]  That's not what goes on.
[00:11:31.662 --> 00:11:33.483]  And that's a stranger doing it.
[00:11:34.909 --> 00:11:51.220]  But now it's the schools going and getting the nerds and the autistic and the low-hanging fruit and then moving on to the rest of the children and destroying their innocence and then saying in that choir song and all the big statements at city councils and at Disney events, we're going to get your children and then we're gonna get you.
[00:11:52.001 --> 00:11:58.712]   They just busted over a hundred and thirty Disney employees in Orlando alone for child sex rings.
[00:11:59.513 --> 00:12:04.418]  They just busted the highest ranking civilian in the Pentagon in Afghanistan.
[00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:05.679]  It's come out, it's been suppressed.
[00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:07.000]  It's mainstream news.
[00:12:07.401 --> 00:12:10.744]  Running child rape rings and porn rings.
[00:12:11.405 --> 00:12:12.046]  Child porn rings.
[00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:18.189]  I have stacks today of government-run facilities raping children as young as five.
[00:12:18.669 --> 00:12:29.616]  I have mainstream German news reporting tens of thousands of children per city, CIA-run, with the psychiatry department of the CPS taking Christians' children and giving them to rape rinks.
[00:12:29.636 --> 00:12:33.738]  I mean, you cannot make up the full magnitude of this.
[00:12:33.858 --> 00:12:47.428]   And then DeSantis calls out the demon in the room, the elephant in the room, the 80 trillion pound Satan, and says, In the bill I've got right here, you will not talk to children 5 to 8 about sex, period.
[00:12:47.468 --> 00:12:48.310]  They can't understand it.
[00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:49.572]  It should be 5 to like 15.
[00:12:52.475 --> 00:12:57.836]  And they have all these people threatening him and threatening to kill him and all these Hollywood scum that look like pedophiles.
[00:12:58.536 --> 00:13:00.957]  I'm not saying the guy's clip we're going to play that he is a pedophile.
[00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.877]  He's called for assaulting me and things.
[00:13:03.677 --> 00:13:07.998]  He also plays Hellboy, the son of Satan or whatever, as a movie theater person.
[00:13:08.018 --> 00:13:10.039]  But he's so gross and disgusting.
[00:13:10.499 --> 00:13:15.780]  And this is Hollywood as it falls and implodes, trying to claw our children down with it into hell.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.500]  I've got the damn bill.
[00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:20.681]  Right here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:22.193 --> 00:13:22.953]  Yeah, what's this guy's name?
[00:13:23.034 --> 00:13:23.734]  Ron Perlman?
[00:13:24.715 --> 00:13:27.276]  Go ahead and play what this maggot has to say.
[00:13:27.296 --> 00:13:28.797]  And by the way, lying!
[00:13:29.157 --> 00:13:31.659]  Oh, he says they're attacking gay people!
[00:13:31.939 --> 00:13:40.284]  No, you're not gonna teach five-year-olds with the teacher about their genitals and about how you can have sex with the same sex.
[00:13:40.604 --> 00:13:45.047]  I don't want same sex, different heterosexual, homosexual.
[00:13:45.327 --> 00:13:47.989]  It's called pedophilia, hellboy!
[00:13:49.016 --> 00:13:50.618]  And you're the one that's gonna get hell.
[00:13:50.938 --> 00:13:52.240]  You're not gonna get our children.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.582]  We're gonna stand up.
[00:13:53.622 --> 00:13:54.883]  We're gonna take society back.
[00:13:55.063 --> 00:13:55.584]  Here he is.
[00:13:56.906 --> 00:13:58.247]  Good morning, Governor DeSantis.
[00:13:59.329 --> 00:13:59.709]  Ron here.
[00:14:01.471 --> 00:14:02.733]  Um... Super creepy.
[00:14:04.755 --> 00:14:05.576]  Don't say gay.
[00:14:06.798 --> 00:14:06.918]  Ugh.
[00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:08.239]  Don't say...
[00:14:09.767 --> 00:14:19.712]  As the first two words in a sentence spoken by a political leader of a state, ugh, in the United States of America, don't say.
[00:14:21.333 --> 00:14:24.014]  Don't fucking say, you fucking Nazi pig.
[00:14:25.555 --> 00:14:26.016]  Say!
[00:14:27.896 --> 00:14:28.637]  First Amendment.
[00:14:30.678 --> 00:14:31.358]  Read about it.
[00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:34.120]  Then run for office.
[00:14:35.681 --> 00:14:36.341]  You piece of shit.
[00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:40.555]  Good morning, Governor DeSantis.
[00:14:42.756 --> 00:14:53.499]  Alright, so, ladies and gentlemen, number one, he's a lying devil who actually plays the devil in a movie, in movies, because he's so ugly and disgusting.
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.721]  But the bill does not say the word gay.
[00:15:01.222 --> 00:15:08.195]   A stolen Word meaning happy and free, just like the rainbow didn't belong to these people.
[00:15:08.355 --> 00:15:11.877]  And the word gay didn't.
[00:15:12.638 --> 00:15:14.779]  And now, oh, you don't hate two men together, do you?
[00:15:14.819 --> 00:15:15.719]  You don't hate two women together?
[00:15:15.779 --> 00:15:16.040]  No!
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.720]  I'm a free spirit.
[00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:20.122]  I don't hate anybody as long as they're adults.
[00:15:20.482 --> 00:15:23.504]  And now it's like, hey, you don't mind if we have a conversation with your children?
[00:15:24.485 --> 00:15:30.647]  You don't mind if we talk about who they are and then designate them as some new designation and take your parental rights away, do you?
[00:15:31.367 --> 00:15:32.408]  Well, hell yeah I do!
[00:15:33.388 --> 00:15:42.691]  You don't mind a biological man comes in this women's bathroom and gets in the showers with women from Austin, Texas to San Francisco to New York City.
[00:15:43.292 --> 00:15:52.675]  Women won't even go to a lot of the salons and a lot of the spas now because you'll be in them routinely and a dude comes in with his genitals flopping around.
[00:15:55.606 --> 00:16:13.715]  Unbelievable ladies and gentlemen, unbelievable raping of our rights, raping of our psyche and they're just getting started and that big old gross creepy Ron Perlman and his threats and just how gross he is.
[00:16:13.735 --> 00:16:16.996]  I'm going to say it, I'm not saying Ron Perlman is a pedophile.
[00:16:17.856 --> 00:16:31.185]   He is supporting the sexualization of children and he looks like Somebody that would be a pedophile, like Brian Stelter.
[00:16:32.145 --> 00:16:44.028]  So if I had to cast people, again, like a couple guys driving around in a white van, kidnapping kids around the country and raping them and killing them, I would cast Ron Perlman and Brian Stelter as evil and evil-er in the new movie.
[00:16:44.668 --> 00:16:47.389]  MTG's coming up next segment with big news!
[00:16:48.109 --> 00:16:50.151]  concerning the pedo rings being out in the open.
[00:16:50.451 --> 00:16:51.532]  It's Wednesday Live!
[00:16:52.153 --> 00:16:57.979]  The world has awakened to the horrible fact that the left's operating system is pedophilia, Satanism, and death.
[00:16:58.499 --> 00:17:03.324]  They hate children and want to steal their future, steal their souls, steal their innocence, and in many cases, kill them.
[00:17:03.765 --> 00:17:08.690]  They also use tragic deaths of children to blame all of us and try to take our guns and free speech.
[00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:11.833]  But we won't let those dirty pedophile rings win.
[00:17:13.288 --> 00:17:17.672]  Because the truth is coming out and their hunger for the innocence of children cannot be contained.
[00:17:18.052 --> 00:17:19.173]  And so they're going to show themselves.
[00:17:19.213 --> 00:17:20.054]  That's why we're going to win.
[00:17:20.314 --> 00:17:21.616]  They're showing themselves now.
[00:17:21.636 --> 00:17:24.218]  About to get back to this huge development as the world awakens.
[00:17:24.538 --> 00:17:28.822]  But first, I want to thank the listeners that have gone to 1776coin.com.
[00:17:29.603 --> 00:17:32.846]  And I want to thank those of you that got the first George Washington slaying the dragon coin.
[00:17:33.326 --> 00:17:34.648]  And now we have the Tree of Liberty coin.
[00:17:34.668 --> 00:17:36.810]  There'll be one other coin that will be announced in a few months.
[00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:38.731]  And that's it for founding member coins.
[00:17:39.472 --> 00:17:53.301]  And if we're able to stay on air and keep operating, which we are, thanks to you, then everybody that becomes a founding member will get all sorts of exclusive content, special things we're going to do, so much I've got planned.
[00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:54.762]  It's going to be huge.
[00:17:55.243 --> 00:17:56.463]  We're three or four months behind.
[00:17:56.503 --> 00:17:58.345]  Everything we're doing is the fights that are going on.
[00:17:59.522 --> 00:18:01.944]  It's all in line to happen, and we're very, very close.
[00:18:01.984 --> 00:18:07.869]  By the time we've sold these three coins, it'll really help capitalize major new stuff with seed money to launch some incredible things.
[00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:11.252]  So, the coin, we've already sold out of close to 40% of them.
[00:18:12.987 --> 00:18:18.009]  And so that means it's following the exact same trend of last time, where it'll be sold out by the end of next week, if not sooner.
[00:18:18.489 --> 00:18:24.211]  And we held back 300 coins, and we just put those up last night on the last coin, and they sold out in a matter of hours.
[00:18:24.511 --> 00:18:29.392]  We're out of the George Washington coin, except for 50 I held back for myself to give friends and family.
[00:18:29.673 --> 00:18:31.653]  Only 50 of those now left, and they're not for sale.
[00:18:32.253 --> 00:18:36.455]  There are only 6,000 of the Tree of Liberty coin available.
[00:18:36.775 --> 00:18:39.256]  I designed it with a top coin designer, but it's my art.
[00:18:40.616 --> 00:18:49.803]  And this is huge, ladies and gentlemen, and this is archetypal to have this in your pocket or on your mantle, that you are funding the tip of the spear against these demons.
[00:18:50.183 --> 00:18:58.909]  I want to thank you for giving us aid and comfort in the fight against the New World Order, and I want to encourage those that have not gone to 1776coin.com to get yours now while you still can.
[00:18:59.369 --> 00:19:07.035]  1776coin.com, or right on the front page of InfoWarsTore.com, you'll see a big link that takes you to the new PatriotCollectibles.com website.
[00:19:07.335 --> 00:19:13.776]  Which, again, is going to have a lot of exclusive stuff, a lot of really amazing stuff, and things that also have very low prices.
[00:19:14.096 --> 00:19:20.917]  But it takes money to build the infrastructure of something like this that will then fund the next level of the InfoWar.
[00:19:20.937 --> 00:19:25.598]  I'm going to leave it at that, not give out strategy, but this is how the founders funded the Revolutionary War.
[00:19:25.618 --> 00:19:35.660]  Those were specially minted coins that were copper, actually, and pewter, but people knew that they'd been part of donating large sums, in many cases, and little American flags.
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:55.870]  Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson went on a ship during the war to France and spent several years there just raising money, and they were printing little American flags, you know, six by a foot or smaller, and that's how they funded about a third of the revolution was trinkets.
[00:19:56.290 --> 00:20:02.754]  Well, this isn't pewter, this isn't—by the way, those are very valuable today—this isn't brass, this isn't copper.
[00:20:03.694 --> 00:20:08.058]  Some of those coins go for millions, by the way, today, from that error, in France and the U.S.
[00:20:08.078 --> 00:20:08.518]  being sold.
[00:20:08.939 --> 00:20:11.180]  This is pure silver, so this is not a trinket.
[00:20:11.781 --> 00:20:17.366]  It wouldn't matter, though, if all we had was an American flag, and I said, hey, we got a thousand of these, fund us, please be part of that, it'd be history.
[00:20:17.406 --> 00:20:26.593]  But this is awesome, and I got this just remembering the founders, and I was watching a couple years ago, I'm digressing, I'll let you go back to the news.
[00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:29.916]  What was that TV show?
[00:20:29.936 --> 00:20:30.877]  It was about John Adams.
[00:20:31.912 --> 00:20:42.359]  And it had a scene in there where they were selling little American flags as trinkets and little copper coins to then, you know, okay, give me ten times what this is worth back for this piece of history.
[00:20:42.619 --> 00:20:48.103]  And of course the French couldn't grab them up quick enough because they understood they were financing a revolution against their archenemy.
[00:20:48.443 --> 00:20:52.486]  Well, you're definitely financing a revolution against humanity's enemy here, baby.
[00:20:52.886 --> 00:20:55.408]  I mean, King George III was an angel compared to these people.
[00:20:56.388 --> 00:20:59.489]  So, we need war bonds, we need money to fight this damn war.
[00:20:59.989 --> 00:21:03.950]  Infowarstore.com right now has the link to PatriotCollectibles.com.
[00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.051]  Please take action, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:06.351 --> 00:21:08.591]  And I thank those that have, and I thank those that will.
[00:21:09.712 --> 00:21:17.834]  Okay, I've gone from liking DeSantis to loving DeSantis to my instincts have told me he's good and now he's got my full backing.
[00:21:18.434 --> 00:21:19.414]  He's the real deal.
[00:21:19.454 --> 00:21:21.235]  He's better than Trump.
[00:21:22.475 --> 00:21:23.716]  I'm not trying to pick favorites here.
[00:21:23.756 --> 00:21:26.439]  I want Trump to get jealous and become more like DeSantis.
[00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:28.641]  We all need to be more like DeSantis.
[00:21:28.701 --> 00:21:29.401]  He's a gentleman.
[00:21:29.441 --> 00:21:29.982]  He's smart.
[00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:31.043]  He's a family man.
[00:21:31.083 --> 00:21:31.784]  He's a patriot.
[00:21:32.204 --> 00:21:32.885]  He's a veteran.
[00:21:32.965 --> 00:21:34.326]  He is our leader.
[00:21:34.346 --> 00:21:39.150]  I mean, if you want to know about who's leading the fight against the New World Order, it's Tucker Carlson and it's DeSantis.
[00:21:39.571 --> 00:21:48.219]  For classy men that are gentlemen, that really care about everybody, that I would say are the best examples of leadership in America, it's DeSantis and Tucker Carlson.
[00:21:48.743 --> 00:21:54.668]  I'm obviously the shock trooper that is the Kraken you release, and I'm proud to be that.
[00:21:54.748 --> 00:22:01.093]  But I can tell you that my job has been to expose this and bring in the men and bring in the women.
[00:22:01.113 --> 00:22:03.815]  I use kind of a John the Baptist analogy.
[00:22:04.136 --> 00:22:04.756]  God told me that.
[00:22:04.776 --> 00:22:06.758]  God's like, you are going to launch the attack.
[00:22:08.419 --> 00:22:12.242]  Prepare the ground, your people are going to prepare the ground, and then you watch the leaders will rise.
[00:22:13.323 --> 00:22:14.164]  And we're seeing that.
[00:22:14.184 --> 00:22:15.825]  And all of us are rising, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:16.186 --> 00:22:17.507]  But I just give credit where it's due.
[00:22:17.547 --> 00:22:21.170]  It's people like DeSantis and people like Tucker Carlson.
[00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.532]  I've almost got Rogan, super hardcore.
[00:22:23.552 --> 00:22:24.392]  He's almost there.
[00:22:24.412 --> 00:22:27.875]  He gets super hardcore and then he kind of goes back a little.
[00:22:30.646 --> 00:22:32.087]  I just gotta spend more time with him.
[00:22:32.147 --> 00:22:32.567]  I love Joe.
[00:22:32.587 --> 00:22:33.348]  We can hang out anytime I want.
[00:22:33.368 --> 00:22:33.848]  I'm gonna call him.
[00:22:33.868 --> 00:22:34.548]  Yeah, let's go get dinner.
[00:22:34.628 --> 00:22:35.149]  Yeah, man, yeah.
[00:22:35.489 --> 00:22:36.570]  Sometimes we hang out like twice a week.
[00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.992]  I just, you know, it's just Joe is really such a sweetheart.
[00:22:40.832 --> 00:22:42.133]  But he doesn't want to be in the middle of the fight.
[00:22:42.513 --> 00:22:43.434]  Not because he's a coward.
[00:22:43.834 --> 00:22:46.155]  He's almost embarrassed to be that deep in the fight.
[00:22:46.215 --> 00:22:51.178]  And it's just like me, a talk show host, a karate guy, a UFC commentator.
[00:22:51.258 --> 00:22:51.919]  Well, you know what?
[00:22:51.999 --> 00:22:53.760]  If you tell the truth, Joe, it makes you the leader.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.801]  So, that's all I'm looking for here is leadership.
[00:22:57.261 --> 00:22:59.641]  That's what we got right now in DeSantis.
[00:23:00.001 --> 00:23:09.363]  Here he is throwing down the gauntlet, telling the pedo folks over at Disney, which by the way, they have a long history of pedophilia over at Disney, hiring convicted pedophiles, you name it.
[00:23:09.563 --> 00:23:12.144]  Tell them he doesn't give a damn about what they say.
[00:23:12.564 --> 00:23:13.364]  This is the attitude.
[00:23:13.384 --> 00:23:14.125]  We're done with you.
[00:23:14.165 --> 00:23:15.265]  We're not bullied by you.
[00:23:15.525 --> 00:23:16.625]  We're breaking with you now.
[00:23:16.865 --> 00:23:19.666]  You can't have our children, you devil-worshipping pedophiles.
[00:23:19.686 --> 00:23:20.106]  Here he is.
[00:23:21.678 --> 00:23:25.582]  In relation to some of the, one of the things I saw yesterday.
[00:23:25.602 --> 00:23:29.185]  You know, we signed the Parents' Rights and Education Bill.
[00:23:29.585 --> 00:23:33.689]  It's interesting when, like, a Disney-owned ABC would put that out on Tweet.
[00:23:33.729 --> 00:23:42.217]  They'd say, Governor DeSantis signs bill to prohibit instruction in sexual identity and gender identity in some grades.
[00:23:42.797 --> 00:23:43.377]  Some grades.
[00:23:43.417 --> 00:23:45.978]  Why would they say some grades instead of K-3?
[00:23:46.378 --> 00:24:04.722]  It's just amazing if you're trying to inform the... So you saw a lot of this, but then for Disney to come out and put a statement and say that the bill should have never passed and that they are going to actively work to repeal it, I think one, was fundamentally dishonest, but two, I think that crossed the line.
[00:24:05.382 --> 00:24:09.784]  This state is governed by the interests of the people of the state of Florida.
[00:24:09.884 --> 00:24:15.167]  It is not based on the demands of California corporate executives.
[00:24:15.507 --> 00:24:17.108]  They do not run this state.
[00:24:17.468 --> 00:24:19.168]  They do not control this state.
[00:24:19.509 --> 00:24:20.969]  I also thought it was interesting.
[00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.851]  I talked to the Speaker of the House yesterday afternoon.
[00:24:24.631 --> 00:24:27.893]  And he said Disney never called him while they were putting this through the house.
[00:24:28.394 --> 00:24:31.075]  They didn't seem to have a problem with it when it was going through.
[00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:34.958]  If this was such an affront, why weren't they speaking up at the outset?
[00:24:34.998 --> 00:24:35.799]  And yet they won't.
[00:24:36.159 --> 00:24:49.848]  And then for them to say they're going to actively work to repeal substantive protections for parents as a company that is supposedly marketing its services to parents with young children, I think they crossed the line.
[00:24:49.908 --> 00:24:53.550]  And, you know, people ask me, you know, kind of about, you know, their posture on the bill.
[00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:54.291]  I said, you know what?
[00:24:55.412 --> 00:25:05.921]  If we would have put in the bill that you were not allowed to have curriculum that discussed the oppression of the Uyghurs in China, Disney would have endorsed that in a second.
[00:25:06.582 --> 00:25:08.143]  And that's the hypocrisy of this.
[00:25:08.624 --> 00:25:14.789]  And we're going to make sure we're fighting back when people are threatening our parents and threatening our kids.
[00:25:16.571 --> 00:25:20.590]   And by the way, folks, If anything, the bill's too timid.
[00:25:20.731 --> 00:25:26.116]  It should be, you can teach biology and about sexual diseases in school, and that's it.
[00:25:26.136 --> 00:25:28.739]  You don't teach about what kind of sex, you damn perverts.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:41.653]  Well, the most demonized member of Congress, that means the most feared, one of the biggest landslide, just two years ago, we gotta get her back in, MTG, is joining us here.
[00:25:42.793 --> 00:25:50.058]  To discuss and talk about the nightmare developments of the coming out of Disney and the coming out of the Democrats.
[00:25:50.158 --> 00:25:51.819]  Let's have these two characters kiss.
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:26:00.726]  Let's, in the background, let's, like, I was just, wherever I could, just basically adding queerness to, like, if you see anything queer in the show, grab them.
[00:26:00.966 --> 00:26:04.849]  But like, I just was like, no one would stop me and no one was trying to stop me.
[00:26:05.309 --> 00:26:08.832]  I'm here as a mother of two queer children, actually.
[00:26:10.833 --> 00:26:18.235]  One transgender child and one pansexual child and also as a leader.
[00:26:19.656 --> 00:26:31.580]  And that was the thing that really got me because I have heard so much from so many of my colleagues over the course of the last couple weeks in open forums and through emails and phone conversations.
[00:26:34.445 --> 00:26:38.609]  I feel a responsibility to speak not just for myself, but for them.
[00:26:39.649 --> 00:26:45.714]  The more centered a story is on a character, the more nuanced you get to get into their story.
[00:26:46.214 --> 00:26:51.078]  And especially with trans characters, you can't see if someone is trans.
[00:26:51.098 --> 00:26:52.759]  There's not one way to look trans.
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:27:05.663]  Kind of the only way to have these, like, canonical trans characters, canonical asexual characters, canonical bisexual characters, is to give them stories where they can, like, be their whole selves?
[00:27:05.903 --> 00:27:06.984]  My kids do have questions.
[00:27:07.024 --> 00:27:12.345]  They want to know who my partner is in pictures outside of my classroom, and I should be able to speak to that.
[00:27:13.033 --> 00:27:17.919]  So do you worry that you won't even be able to talk about your own personal home life?
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.782]  I mean, I have a child in kindergarten right now.
[00:27:19.962 --> 00:27:26.430]  I know exactly that my child has two teachers, one of which has a daughter at home and is single.
[00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:28.553]  The other is married and has four children.
[00:27:28.693 --> 00:27:31.456]  I know everything about their lives because my kid tells me.
[00:27:31.937 --> 00:27:32.498]  Absolutely.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.581]  You are 100% correct.
[00:27:36.342 --> 00:27:37.784]  That's what we do as educators.
[00:27:37.824 --> 00:27:39.446]  We build relationships with our kids.
[00:27:39.827 --> 00:27:42.510]  And in order to build relationships, you talk about your home life.
[00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.272]  You talk about what you do on the weekends.
[00:27:44.673 --> 00:27:45.734]  That's building community.
[00:27:46.275 --> 00:27:47.676]  It scares me.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:54.423]  I am not going to be able to have these conversations with my children because they're going to ask me what I did on the weekend.
[00:27:54.543 --> 00:28:00.506]  I don't want to have to hide that my partner and I went paddle boarding this weekend because then they ask, well, what does partner mean, Mr. Bernard?
[00:28:00.986 --> 00:28:03.568]  And you know, I'm worried that can I tell them what it means?
[00:28:03.968 --> 00:28:05.129]  I'm also worried for my kids.
[00:28:05.229 --> 00:28:09.231]  I have a little girl this year who has two moms and the kids are curious about her two moms.
[00:28:09.251 --> 00:28:10.691]  They want to know about her two moms.
[00:28:11.152 --> 00:28:17.175]  You know, if they come to, if they go to her and ask her about her two moms and she doesn't know what to say, they're going to come to me and ask me.
[00:28:17.555 --> 00:28:23.099]  I've got MSNBC hosts and others saying, we need to tell kindergartners about our love life with other people.
[00:28:23.139 --> 00:28:24.580]  I don't care if it's heterosexual or homosexual.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.400]  They shouldn't do it.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.122]  I've got Disney execs saying they're trying to erase us.
[00:28:28.622 --> 00:28:31.104]  DeSantis is trying to criminalize us.
[00:28:31.204 --> 00:28:31.905]  I've got the bill.
[00:28:32.105 --> 00:28:40.950]  They just said don't tell people, first grade through to the time they're eight years old or whatever, about sex and their identity and all this.
[00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:41.851]  This is incredible.
[00:28:42.451 --> 00:28:53.656]   So looking at this and the world awakening to it, But I love Trump, but I got to tell you DeSantis coming out and being like MTG and saying, I don't care what Hollywood or the media says.
[00:28:53.896 --> 00:28:54.756]  You don't run our state.
[00:28:54.776 --> 00:28:55.396]  You don't run us.
[00:28:55.436 --> 00:28:55.916]  Go to hell.
[00:28:55.936 --> 00:28:57.216]  We're going to protect our children.
[00:28:57.256 --> 00:29:03.558]  The fact that he's not intimidated is an example to us all, just as Marjorie Taylor Greene has been.
[00:29:03.618 --> 00:29:07.219]  So we salute the great Congresswoman from Georgia to talk about this.
[00:29:07.419 --> 00:29:08.299]  It's good to see you there.
[00:29:08.519 --> 00:29:09.499]  Thank you for coming on.
[00:29:10.779 --> 00:29:12.000]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.620]  And I totally agree with you.
[00:29:14.099 --> 00:29:28.421]  At this point and stage in our history and what's happening in our country, every single person needs to be all hands on deck in protecting our children and stopping this radical sexualization of children.
[00:29:28.441 --> 00:29:33.562]  They're basically exploiting them, brainwashing them, indoctrinating them.
[00:29:34.182 --> 00:29:41.264]  And it's hard to believe that Disney, Walt Disney, the Walt Disney Company would be the very place that this is happening.
[00:29:41.304 --> 00:29:43.464]  This is supposed to be the happiest place on earth.
[00:29:43.911 --> 00:29:50.513]  A place where innocence is celebrated, but it seems to be the place where innocence is actually under attack.
[00:29:50.974 --> 00:29:56.336]  And I applaud Governor DeSantis for this bill and for his willingness to take on this issue.
[00:29:56.836 --> 00:29:59.877]  And I'll be working with my colleagues here in Congress.
[00:30:00.017 --> 00:30:05.459]  I believe that it is the most important thing the Republican Party can do is to stand up for families.
[00:30:05.719 --> 00:30:08.640]  And that's what we should do is we should be protecting our most innocent.
[00:30:09.285 --> 00:30:16.167]  Citizens in our country, and that is our children, every single minor under the age of 18 should be protected.
[00:30:16.907 --> 00:30:19.908]  Just their body, their mind, their soul.
[00:30:19.968 --> 00:30:21.129]  We have to protect them.
[00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:22.529]  Leave them alone.
[00:30:22.729 --> 00:30:26.350]  Let them grow up and educate them in wholesome, good education.
[00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:29.811]  And let them become adults and make their own decisions.
[00:30:29.951 --> 00:30:31.212]  But this is outrageous.
[00:30:31.732 --> 00:30:35.073]  And Walt Disney, they need to pay a serious price for this.
[00:30:35.629 --> 00:30:44.899]  You were on about a month ago and you talked about biological men going into little girls' showers, going into these places and saying, man, if my husband caught somebody with my daughters, they'd be in trouble.
[00:30:44.939 --> 00:30:46.080]  That's just a normal statement.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.263]  They said, oh, MTG calls for beating up transgenders.
[00:30:49.303 --> 00:30:49.824]  You explain.
[00:30:50.164 --> 00:30:54.088]  No, we're not saying a man thinks he's a woman or any of these people that we hate them.
[00:30:54.108 --> 00:30:55.389]  And I share your view.
[00:30:55.469 --> 00:30:56.090]  People do hate them.
[00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:56.591]  That's their right.
[00:30:56.611 --> 00:30:57.011]  They love them.
[00:30:57.031 --> 00:30:57.471]  That's their right.
[00:30:58.152 --> 00:31:00.073]  They never quote what you actually say.
[00:31:00.113 --> 00:31:04.457]  And of course, they're going to say here, you endorse violence, you endorse banning these people.
[00:31:04.517 --> 00:31:06.638]  No, we ban anybody.
[00:31:07.319 --> 00:31:14.484]  Imagine if we were at the park and we're cooking hamburgers and some dude walks over and asks, you know, your kids, hey, can I talk to your kids about sex?
[00:31:14.504 --> 00:31:15.384]  You'd call the police.
[00:31:15.664 --> 00:31:17.706]  But now they just want to do it in the schools.
[00:31:18.306 --> 00:31:21.148]  And confuse our little five-year-old and six-year-old children?
[00:31:21.168 --> 00:31:22.609]  This is ridiculous!
[00:31:22.649 --> 00:31:24.230]  This is unbelievable!
[00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:34.797]  And then we see the footage, even here in Austin, of elementary students being paraded around like trophies, and drag queens, big fat men in clown suits, rubbing all over them and hugging them and all this.
[00:31:34.857 --> 00:31:36.037]  I mean, this is crazy!
[00:31:36.057 --> 00:31:39.480]  It is crazy, and you know what?
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.621]  There's nothing wrong with being angry about it.
[00:31:41.974 --> 00:31:51.060]  And there's nothing wrong as a parent or just a regular American that is willing to say that this is outrageous and it has to stop and willing to stop it.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.182]  And that's what we all need to do is we need to be willing to stop it.
[00:31:54.502 --> 00:31:57.664]  You know, they have an agenda and the agenda is very clear.
[00:31:57.684 --> 00:32:00.146]  It is to sexualize children.
[00:32:00.226 --> 00:32:06.230]  It's to confuse them and make them think that they can choose their gender, which absolutely they cannot.
[00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:14.719]  And I will stand on God's truth every single time there are two genders, male and female, and God made us in His image, male or female.
[00:32:15.019 --> 00:32:15.900]  And that's just the truth.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:16.701]  It's in the Bible.
[00:32:16.761 --> 00:32:17.602]  It's in Genesis.
[00:32:18.082 --> 00:32:42.501]   And it's just the flat-out truth, Alex, and the whole idea That teachers, teachers unions, radical activists that are on to this horrible agenda where they want to indoctrinate sexualized children, confuse them, think they can change their gender, or encourage them like Pete Buttigieg's husband
[00:32:43.061 --> 00:32:43.601]  I did.
[00:32:43.621 --> 00:32:52.504]  I saw him on video with Among Children and they were saying, he had them saying the pledge to the pride flag or something.
[00:32:53.284 --> 00:32:53.824]  No, I'm sorry.
[00:32:53.864 --> 00:33:02.047]  We have one pledge in this country and that is to our American flag and we pledge that allegiance to our country's flag.
[00:33:02.547 --> 00:33:08.547]   It shouldn't be pledging allegiance to some sort of movement or sexualization of children.
[00:33:08.547 --> 00:33:11.747]  So, you know, all of them need to leave kids alone.
[00:33:11.747 --> 00:33:14.666]  And there's nothing wrong with being against this.
[00:33:14.666 --> 00:33:17.547]  And you know, men need to stay out of our sports.
[00:33:17.547 --> 00:33:18.547]  Women are under attack.
[00:33:18.547 --> 00:33:20.027]  It's not just children.
[00:33:20.027 --> 00:33:21.425]  It's also women.
[00:33:21.425 --> 00:33:23.905]  They are trying to replace us.
[00:33:23.905 --> 00:33:26.146]  They're trying to replace us in our sports.
[00:33:26.242 --> 00:33:26.863]  Absolutely.
[00:33:26.883 --> 00:33:31.627]  Listen, I'm not against people because they're homosexual, because there's some nice folks out there.
[00:33:31.647 --> 00:33:34.409]  But a lot of these people do not like women, period.
[00:33:35.049 --> 00:33:37.551]  And this is an attack and like a takeover.
[00:33:37.611 --> 00:33:40.694]  It's a robbery of women's space and it needs to stop.
[00:33:40.974 --> 00:33:42.936]  So bare minimum, it's a bunch of women haters.
[00:33:43.356 --> 00:33:45.098]  And then on the other end, it's pedophiles.
[00:33:45.418 --> 00:33:53.167]   And of course, you know, the San Francisco gay Choir, I made the point on air when this came out last year when they said, we're going to recruit your children, we're going to groom them, we're going to get them.
[00:33:53.468 --> 00:33:54.649]  You can't stop us, parents.
[00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:56.612]  We are recruiting them.
[00:33:57.173 --> 00:34:01.298]  I said, I bet a bunch of them turn out to be convicted pedophiles and rapists, and a bunch of them were.
[00:34:01.779 --> 00:34:03.582]  So, I mean, this is dangerous.
[00:34:04.983 --> 00:34:05.804]  It is dangerous.
[00:34:05.864 --> 00:34:07.585]  And listen, I totally agree with you, Alex.
[00:34:08.026 --> 00:34:10.107]  It's not about someone's sexuality.
[00:34:10.167 --> 00:34:13.130]  It's not a judgment on what they choose to do privately.
[00:34:13.831 --> 00:34:18.134]  Sexually, I don't judge that at all and that's none of my business and I don't want to know.
[00:34:18.675 --> 00:34:23.999]  And so it's not about being against someone being gay or whatever their choices are.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.180]  It's about our kids.
[00:34:25.621 --> 00:34:26.962]  Leave the kids alone.
[00:34:27.369 --> 00:34:28.711]  And it's about women's rights.
[00:34:28.991 --> 00:34:30.293]  Stay out of our sports.
[00:34:30.493 --> 00:34:31.754]  Stay out of our bathrooms.
[00:34:32.135 --> 00:34:33.396]  Stay out of our dorm rooms.
[00:34:33.617 --> 00:34:38.122]  And stop this brainwashing and indoctrination of children.
[00:34:38.563 --> 00:34:40.265]  All of this doesn't belong in school.
[00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:46.933]  And, you know, it doesn't make me hateful to say these things and be willing to speak out against it.
[00:34:47.643 --> 00:35:05.353]  It makes me a person that's willing to speak the truth and it makes me someone that's willing to stand up for children and protect their innocence and protect their own identity and stop this assault on their character and stop this assault basically on what they believe about themselves.
[00:35:05.473 --> 00:35:14.078]  It's outrageous that this is happening and it's not wrong to stand up for female athletes, legitimate biological female athletes.
[00:35:14.591 --> 00:35:36.586]  That are unwilling to do so, because Alex, the truth is, if you're an athlete on scholarship in college, there's a lot of rules on what you're allowed to say publicly, or especially... That's right, they can't speak for themselves, we should speak for them, and we should end this bullying tyranny, because the left and all this LGBTP is a sex cult.
[00:35:36.666 --> 00:35:39.748]  I mean, most of the cults in ancient times were sexually based.
[00:35:40.228 --> 00:35:41.668]  And Aleister Crowley was sex-based.
[00:35:41.688 --> 00:35:45.810]  And they literally know that as you get older, you learn about your boundaries and what you want to do.
[00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:47.270]  A child doesn't know.
[00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:48.610]  That's why they're not of age.
[00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:49.831]  It's why they can't join the military.
[00:35:49.851 --> 00:35:51.291]  It's why they can't drink liquor.
[00:35:51.351 --> 00:35:52.592]  It's why they can't get a firearm.
[00:35:52.892 --> 00:35:58.873]  But five-year-olds, Disney believes, should have talks with their LGBTP people about maybe they're in other sex.
[00:35:59.073 --> 00:36:00.274]  Well, of course, it's going to confuse them.
[00:36:00.294 --> 00:36:00.974]  They're going to go, yeah.
[00:36:01.314 --> 00:36:02.574]  A little boy will say, I like boys.
[00:36:02.614 --> 00:36:03.515]  Little boys like boys.
[00:36:03.595 --> 00:36:04.135]  Be friends with them.
[00:36:04.355 --> 00:36:05.135]  Little girls like girls.
[00:36:05.215 --> 00:36:06.836]  And now you're saying, oh, you like them.
[00:36:07.136 --> 00:36:07.936]  That's who you are.
[00:36:08.556 --> 00:36:12.758]  It's pure social engineering, behavioral psychology, raping their innocence.
[00:36:12.878 --> 00:36:13.758]  It is disgusting.
[00:36:14.819 --> 00:36:16.580]  Well, it's also predatorial.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.560]  I'm willing to use that word.
[00:36:18.961 --> 00:36:20.341]  This is predatorial.
[00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:23.923]  This didn't happen when you and I were growing up.
[00:36:24.283 --> 00:36:31.106]  This didn't happen maybe even 10 to 15 years ago, but this is predatorial behavior.
[00:36:31.126 --> 00:36:32.767]  This is hyper-predatory behavior.
[00:36:32.787 --> 00:36:33.527]  You're totally right.
[00:36:33.907 --> 00:36:34.768]  One word describes it.
[00:36:34.908 --> 00:36:35.528]  Predatorial.
[00:36:36.587 --> 00:36:37.027]  Mm-hmm.
[00:36:37.147 --> 00:36:49.890]  And if anyone that is against stopping this and is saying no, they should be allowed to indoctrinate children into just wrong sexual immorality, you know what?
[00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:52.650]  That means they are pro-predatorial behavior.
[00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:55.511]  So, you know, we need to challenge everyone.
[00:36:55.831 --> 00:37:02.412]  If you are for what Disney is doing, if you're for what this mother... Congresswoman, stay right there.
[00:37:02.432 --> 00:37:03.373]  We'll be right back.
[00:37:03.433 --> 00:37:04.453]  Amazing interview with MTG.
[00:37:06.348 --> 00:37:09.570]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Beyond Hollywood at Babylon.
[00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:10.471]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:37:10.511 --> 00:37:13.193]  Final segment with Marjorie Taylor Greene joining us.
[00:37:13.753 --> 00:37:14.694]  Congresswoman from Georgia.
[00:37:16.955 --> 00:37:21.218]  Again, let's just talk about normal biological male-female relationships.
[00:37:21.398 --> 00:37:27.224]   Anybody knows that has any game That you're a single male, single female, whatever.
[00:37:27.264 --> 00:37:29.546]  You don't run up and say, hey, what sex are you?
[00:37:29.566 --> 00:37:30.526]  Or what sex are you into?
[00:37:30.566 --> 00:37:31.567]  Let's talk about sex.
[00:37:32.067 --> 00:37:36.950]  Women, men, because I've had women now that I'm famous, whatever, come up to me and start talking about having sex right away.
[00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:38.791]  And I'm like, whoa, this is a little weird.
[00:37:39.671 --> 00:37:40.952]  Even the men run away from that.
[00:37:41.332 --> 00:37:45.734]  My wife would run away if I showed up while she's cooking dinner or doing something with my daughter.
[00:37:45.954 --> 00:37:47.055]  Hey, baby, let's have sex.
[00:37:47.075 --> 00:37:47.675]  She'd be like, what?
[00:37:47.775 --> 00:37:48.456]  What's going on here?
[00:37:49.943 --> 00:37:50.804]  You'll hear a foreplay.
[00:37:51.124 --> 00:37:54.046]  There's not even foreplay with these pedos.
[00:37:54.066 --> 00:37:56.247]  That's what they are, in pedo enablers and gruminers.
[00:37:56.708 --> 00:38:00.230]  They're coming right in to 5, 6, 7 year olds going, we're going to talk about your sex.
[00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:01.571]  We're going to paint your nails.
[00:38:01.591 --> 00:38:07.555]  We're going to have a man in a woman's outfit with a wig who weighs 400 pounds have you sit in their lap.
[00:38:07.755 --> 00:38:10.417]  We're going to have weird leftist parents bring their kids to these events.
[00:38:10.517 --> 00:38:13.679]  I mean, this is the creepiest, weirdest, craziest stuff.
[00:38:13.999 --> 00:38:19.463]  If 20 years ago they had a movie about a future dystopia where pedophiles are doing all this, I wouldn't believe it.
[00:38:20.423 --> 00:38:26.546]  And so again, as an adult, think about on a dating app, if somebody talked to you like this, you'd say no.
[00:38:26.826 --> 00:38:45.175]   As an adult, these are children being literally attacked worldwide by behavioral psychologist manuals, and I notice in these documents I've got right here that have come out in the news from Texas, sad for our state, and New York and Oregon and so many places, They tell them.
[00:38:45.395 --> 00:39:02.472]  And then when the parents fight back, here's how you counter, and make the children feel like they're victims, and now their parents are bad, suppressing you, because you don't, as a five-year-old, your parents don't want you learning how to do sexual things, I can't even say, on an adult radio show, in polite company, in front of a congresswoman.
[00:39:02.712 --> 00:39:06.116]  I mean, this is just over-the-top insane.
[00:39:06.436 --> 00:39:07.317]  How do we counter this?
[00:39:07.357 --> 00:39:08.258]  What's your response to it?
[00:39:10.044 --> 00:39:15.187]  Our response, Alex, is we should be unapologetic in fighting back.
[00:39:15.587 --> 00:39:16.467]  That is our job.
[00:39:16.647 --> 00:39:23.791]  Our job as parents, our job as responsible adults, our job is to protect children, and these are predators.
[00:39:24.271 --> 00:39:26.672]  These are absolutely child predators.
[00:39:27.353 --> 00:39:41.935]   Not only are we talking about pedophiles, but we're also talking about anyone That is willing to coerce a child, indoctrinate a child about sex and about themselves and their own body.
[00:39:42.335 --> 00:39:47.798]  That is indoctrination and that is predatorial behavior and it must be stopped.
[00:39:47.898 --> 00:39:49.519]  It all means necessary.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.820]  It has to be stopped.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:56.944]  You see, the problem is Alex, we've turned our head the other way because we are constantly getting shamed.
[00:39:57.324 --> 00:40:04.126]  They're telling us, oh, you're hateful, you know, you're a homophobic if you're against these things.
[00:40:04.626 --> 00:40:06.647]  You know, and I agree totally with you, Alex.
[00:40:07.067 --> 00:40:08.148]  We're not hateful.
[00:40:08.208 --> 00:40:09.268]  We're not homophobic.
[00:40:09.308 --> 00:40:11.729]  It's not about... But we are pedophobic.
[00:40:11.749 --> 00:40:13.229]  Can you say that in your own words?
[00:40:13.269 --> 00:40:15.310]  It'll be a huge news story.
[00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:16.911]  MTG is not pedophobic.
[00:40:16.931 --> 00:40:17.791]  Say it in your own words, please.
[00:40:19.139 --> 00:40:21.760]  Oh, no, I am definitely pedophobic.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.601]  I'm absolutely against pedophiles.
[00:40:23.741 --> 00:40:24.181]  Good!
[00:40:24.482 --> 00:40:26.963]  Oh, I was going to shame you into being pro-pedophile.
[00:40:27.143 --> 00:40:28.063]  Oh, I can't have you on.
[00:40:28.103 --> 00:40:28.524]  You're hateful.
[00:40:28.764 --> 00:40:42.410]  So you're against adults picking up five-year-olds in parks or out of their backyards because Nambla and all of them say that they are adults, that children are sexual creatures, and that they have the free will to have sex with adults.
[00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:44.371]  So you are a pedophobe.
[00:40:44.511 --> 00:40:45.732]  Shame on you!
[00:40:47.594 --> 00:40:50.136]  Yeah, no, I'm not going to be afraid to say that 100%.
[00:40:50.196 --> 00:40:52.657]  Well, I'm going to say it too.
[00:40:52.778 --> 00:40:59.322]  I am completely phobic of pedophiles and predators in general and armed robbers and every other form of criminal.
[00:40:59.782 --> 00:41:00.263]  Absolutely.
[00:41:00.303 --> 00:41:03.545]  But particularly pedophilia, the way it's just flooding society.
[00:41:04.913 --> 00:41:05.634]  Absolutely.
[00:41:05.754 --> 00:41:06.534]  We should be.
[00:41:06.834 --> 00:41:07.975]  Everyone should be.
[00:41:08.295 --> 00:41:09.976]  And shame on anyone that's not.
[00:41:09.996 --> 00:41:11.517]  This should never be normalized.
[00:41:11.857 --> 00:41:13.458]  Children are not sexual creatures.
[00:41:13.798 --> 00:41:18.921]  You cannot be someone that claims to be attracted to children and think that that's okay.
[00:41:18.941 --> 00:41:20.202]  That is absolutely not okay.
[00:41:20.242 --> 00:41:20.762]  It's evil.
[00:41:21.162 --> 00:41:23.204]  And everything about it is evil.
[00:41:23.304 --> 00:41:25.265]  And we're never going to accept it.
[00:41:25.545 --> 00:41:30.548]  And that doesn't make us a bad person for refusing to accept it and saying, no, we're going to stop you.
[00:41:30.928 --> 00:41:32.029]  I totally agree with you.
[00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:37.070]   As a matter of fact, we're going to bring laws, more laws against you for doing these things.
[00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:40.829]   There's nothing wrong with that. That puts us on the right side of history,
[00:41:40.829 --> 00:41:44.430]  and that puts us in the category of protecting children.
[00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:49.710]   And Alex, I totally agree with you. I mean, there's nothing wrong with saying I am
[00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:53.550]  pedophobic or whatever this is, but you know, it's enough.
[00:41:53.764 --> 00:41:54.684]  I've had enough of it.
[00:41:54.744 --> 00:41:55.865]  I know you've had enough of it.
[00:41:56.145 --> 00:41:58.306]  And parents have had enough of it.
[00:41:58.426 --> 00:41:59.567]  Shame on Hollywood.
[00:41:59.707 --> 00:42:01.208]  Shame on Disney World.
[00:42:01.548 --> 00:42:09.834]  Shame on any major corporation that wants to sell clothing that basically sells the sexual image with children.
[00:42:09.974 --> 00:42:11.335]  Shame on any legislator.
[00:42:11.355 --> 00:42:13.216]  Shame on any member of Congress, Senator.
[00:42:13.716 --> 00:42:18.839]  Anyone, state level, federal level, that is willing to push this and keep pushing it.
[00:42:18.939 --> 00:42:23.762]  Shame on teachers unions that will not stop this and are actually encouraging teachers.
[00:42:24.135 --> 00:42:29.295]   to indoctrinate children and change their gender without their parents having any idea
[00:42:29.295 --> 00:42:30.455]  that this is happening.
[00:42:30.455 --> 00:42:35.414]   And by the way, even Bill Maher says he read the bill and yeah, you shouldn't have 5-8
[00:42:35.414 --> 00:42:39.335]   year olds being taught about sex by perfect strangers, much less parents.
[00:42:39.335 --> 00:42:40.455]  The kids aren't asking it.
[00:42:40.455 --> 00:42:42.494]  It screws up children to do that.
[00:42:42.494 --> 00:42:44.814]  All behavioral psychologists know that.
[00:42:44.814 --> 00:42:45.895]  But we go back to Nickelodeon.
[00:42:45.928 --> 00:42:52.872]  Ten years ago, documents came out on Disney where they planned to do this, and it's all about breaking up the family, breaking up society.
[00:42:52.912 --> 00:43:02.198]  What do you think the bigger goals of this are, and what legislation, you were talking about earlier, can we support to protect the innocence of our children from these predators?
[00:43:03.819 --> 00:43:06.781]  Absolutely, we can do legislation to protect our children.
[00:43:07.081 --> 00:43:09.062]  You know, Congress makes the laws.
[00:43:09.182 --> 00:43:14.404]   Congress funds the money that funds So are you going to write a bill or introduce a bill?
[00:43:14.424 --> 00:43:15.664]  Because you've got the power to do it.
[00:43:15.484 --> 00:43:20.484]   of ed. You know there should be no federal funding to any school, any school
[00:43:20.484 --> 00:43:25.083]   anywhere that is indoctrinating children, that is teaching them that they can
[00:43:25.083 --> 00:43:29.124]   change their gender, that is teaching them anything sick and disgusting like
[00:43:29.124 --> 00:43:33.003]   this. We should stop all federal funding. So are you gonna write a bill or
[00:43:33.003 --> 00:43:36.523]   introduce a bill because you've got the power to do it. We would all get
[00:43:36.523 --> 00:43:39.523]   behind you a bill to pull federal funding out of any school that
[00:43:39.523 --> 00:43:46.203]   sexualizes children? Absolutely 100% I'll meet with my leg like
[00:43:44.728 --> 00:43:55.310]  I'll meet with my team right after this interview, and we will get to work on it, Alex, because I will do anything I can to protect kids, and I only want allies.
[00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:56.090]  You know what?
[00:43:56.150 --> 00:44:00.711]  If someone doesn't like me or my legislation, then who cares?
[00:44:00.911 --> 00:44:01.411]  I don't care.
[00:44:01.671 --> 00:44:08.153]  But I think most parents and most people in this country would be on our side and be willing to get behind this.
[00:44:09.653 --> 00:44:12.934]  Well, I just really appreciate your time and you coming on with us today.
[00:44:13.194 --> 00:44:17.654]  This subject is just so insane, and the left just can't help themselves.
[00:44:17.774 --> 00:44:29.437]  I mean, there's so many people, I think, who are liberals, who aren't bad people, that are doing this through peer pressure, and I just want to ask them, how far are you going to go in signing off to this agenda?
[00:44:29.457 --> 00:44:35.698]  Because this agenda will be defeated, because it's literally the sexualization and destruction of children.
[00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:36.518]  It must stop.
[00:44:36.558 --> 00:44:37.118]  It will stop.
[00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:40.431]  Yes, it must stop and it has to stop.
[00:44:40.771 --> 00:44:42.232]  But look, it's already done damage.
[00:44:42.272 --> 00:44:50.117]  You've got, I think the numbers came out today that 20% of 18 to like 32 year olds are gay.
[00:44:50.277 --> 00:44:52.858]  And that's a much higher number than it used to be.
[00:44:53.238 --> 00:44:55.360]  So you can already see an effect.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.400]  These are willing adults.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.721]  They're making their own decisions.
[00:44:58.141 --> 00:45:03.125]  However, that number was a lot lower 10 to 20 years ago, and so forth.
[00:45:04.106 --> 00:45:06.448]  Well, they're being bullied into a cult.
[00:45:06.948 --> 00:45:09.050]  If somebody has free will, that's fine.
[00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:18.278]  But literally, I've got some numbers here out of schools where teachers are bragging 60 plus percent of their students now identify as same-sex under this brainwashing.
[00:45:18.338 --> 00:45:20.780]  I mean, this is an extinction-level event.
[00:45:22.021 --> 00:45:24.923]  Yes, it is, and it's a terrible decline.
[00:45:25.099 --> 00:45:31.259]   of our society, and especially when our children become the victims and the targets of complete
[00:45:31.259 --> 00:45:35.259]  disgusting immorality. And that's why we have to stop it.
[00:45:35.259 --> 00:45:41.818]   It's our job. It's our duty. It's our responsibility. And this responsibility sits squarely
[00:45:41.818 --> 00:45:43.499]  on our shoulders.
[00:45:43.691 --> 00:45:45.212]  And that's something I understand.
[00:45:45.252 --> 00:45:46.493]  That's something you understand.
[00:45:46.793 --> 00:45:49.535]  And I know your listening audience totally agrees with us.
[00:45:49.795 --> 00:45:50.275]  Absolutely.
[00:45:50.315 --> 00:45:51.016]  Here's the headline.
[00:45:51.056 --> 00:45:52.877]  Public school indoctrination is real.
[00:45:52.977 --> 00:46:00.462]  Fourth grade teacher in Austin told her peers 63% of her class came out as LGBTQIA.
[00:46:00.482 --> 00:46:01.403]  I would add the P.
[00:46:03.015 --> 00:46:06.218]  That's because that teacher is making that happen.
[00:46:07.659 --> 00:46:18.069]  Just like she would teach her students math and they could say so much percent of the children in the math could understand whatever math that she's teaching them and they can pass the test.
[00:46:18.389 --> 00:46:20.271]  There she has 63% of her students passing her test.
[00:46:24.134 --> 00:46:31.020]  Uh, training her students to believe these horrible things about themselves when they should never be being taught.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:31.460]  Well, that's right.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:35.103]  She's got a captive audience of children that are designed to follow adult leaders.
[00:46:35.524 --> 00:46:37.525]  Their parents drop them off, so their parents are good.
[00:46:37.545 --> 00:46:38.646]  These must be good leaders.
[00:46:39.006 --> 00:46:43.630]  And then they sit there and indoctrinate them to totally screw them up and bring them into a sex cult.
[00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:47.133]  I mean, this makes NXIVM, that was with adults and I'm totally against it.
[00:46:47.293 --> 00:46:48.674]  This makes NXIVM look tame.
[00:46:48.694 --> 00:46:51.497]  They're literally setting up NXIVM sex cults for children.
[00:46:52.779 --> 00:46:54.059]  Guys, it's horrific.
[00:46:54.219 --> 00:46:56.420]  I don't even know why that teacher still has a job.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:00.961]  Every single parent that has a child at that school should be demanding that that teacher be fired.
[00:47:01.341 --> 00:47:05.762]  And then they should also be demanding to completely see everything out.
[00:47:05.842 --> 00:47:06.522]  Absolutely.
[00:47:06.562 --> 00:47:09.222]  Marjorie Taylor Greene, Congresswoman, if you've got to go, you've got to go.
[00:47:09.242 --> 00:47:10.363]  We've got to go to break for two minutes.
[00:47:10.383 --> 00:47:11.783]  We do five more minutes on the other side.
[00:47:12.103 --> 00:47:17.144]  I want to talk about what happened with Congressman Gates calling out the Hunter Biden laptop and so much more.
[00:47:17.164 --> 00:47:18.064]  You've got to go understand.
[00:47:18.484 --> 00:47:19.545]  MTG, she's awesome.
[00:47:19.565 --> 00:47:19.945]  Stay with us.
[00:47:20.485 --> 00:47:21.025]  So where is it?
[00:47:22.671 --> 00:47:23.191]  The laptop.
[00:47:27.352 --> 00:47:29.953]  Sir, I'm not here to talk about the laptop.
[00:47:29.973 --> 00:47:31.933]  I'm here to talk about the FBI cyber program.
[00:47:32.193 --> 00:47:35.014]  You are the assistant director of FBI cyber.
[00:47:35.574 --> 00:47:37.535]  I want to know where Hunter Biden's laptop is.
[00:47:38.155 --> 00:47:38.575]  Where is it?
[00:47:38.915 --> 00:47:39.975]  Sir, I don't know that answer.
[00:47:40.595 --> 00:47:41.756]  That is astonishing to me.
[00:47:42.316 --> 00:47:51.378]  Has FBI cyber assessed whether or not Hunter Biden's laptop could be a point of vulnerability allowing America's enemies to hurt our country?
[00:47:52.389 --> 00:48:05.120]  Sir, the FBI's cyber program is based off of what's codified in Title 18, Section 1030, a code which talks about computer intrusions, right, using nefarious intent.
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:06.742]  Well, you've talked about passwords here.
[00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:11.393]  Wow, what a powerful exchange with Representative Matt Gaetz.
[00:48:11.473 --> 00:48:14.316]  Successfully enters Hunter Biden's laptop into the congressional record.
[00:48:14.716 --> 00:48:18.799]  Massive persecution of the January 6th people, most of which were totally peaceful.
[00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:21.041]  Many of them still held in solitary confinement.
[00:48:21.381 --> 00:48:25.385]  Freedom Convoy folks held in solitary confinement without even being able to see lawyers a month in.
[00:48:25.405 --> 00:48:26.305]  This is so dangerous.
[00:48:26.966 --> 00:48:29.228]  Where is this Hunter Biden laptop situation going?
[00:48:29.248 --> 00:48:31.750]  Because we knew it was going on a year and a half ago in the election.
[00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:33.451]  Then they censored it and shut it down.
[00:48:33.471 --> 00:48:36.454]  And now it's all proven that he was basically a Chinese spy.
[00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:47.517]  Well, the Hunter Biden laptop, all of the contents have been entered in the congressional record, thanks to my great colleague from Florida there, Matt Gaetz.
[00:48:47.637 --> 00:48:49.618]  That was incredible work on his part.
[00:48:50.119 --> 00:48:52.280]  And so, you know what I look forward to, Alex?
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:49:01.307]  I look forward to taking back the House, Republicans having control, and we are going to investigate and go after every single thing these people have done.
[00:49:01.587 --> 00:49:03.569]  You know, Hunter Biden, the most interesting thing.
[00:49:04.039 --> 00:49:13.922]  That I really look forward to looking into, and you can find proof of it on his laptop, is that there is funding into biolabs in Ukraine.
[00:49:14.529 --> 00:49:29.763]  And, you know, not only was Hunter Biden investing in energy companies in Ukraine and China and his father, our president, was involved and his uncle and who knows who else, but also they were investing in bio labs.
[00:49:29.963 --> 00:49:33.086]  And it's so interesting that they were doing that.
[00:49:33.106 --> 00:49:40.253]  And then here, our country was crippled by a man-made virus, COVID-19, from the Wuhan lab.
[00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:44.252]  And these are the things that we have got to dig deeply into.
[00:49:44.412 --> 00:49:45.993]  And I'm just so proud of Matt.
[00:49:46.353 --> 00:49:57.477]  He did such a good job by doing that and entering Hunter's laptop and all the contents into the congressional record, because now it's wide open and we can go after every single bit of it.
[00:49:57.793 --> 00:50:06.463]  Congresswoman, the theme I get from you is courage, and you talk a lot about this, but you have it, Matt Gaetz has it, DeSantis has it, Trump has had it to a certain extent.
[00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:16.434]  I want to see other conservative and populist and nationalist leaders get that being attacked by the New York Times and CNN is good, and stop cowering and bowing to Hollywood.
[00:50:16.455 --> 00:50:17.376]  They're a paper tiger.
[00:50:17.836 --> 00:50:20.437]  And I think that's the biggest thing, is just stop being scared.
[00:50:20.457 --> 00:50:21.638]  Like, you're not scared to come on here.
[00:50:21.878 --> 00:50:24.439]  They demonize you, people love you more, because it's all true!
[00:50:24.679 --> 00:50:29.041]  And we need to let this hoax, this spell we're under, break and have some courage.
[00:50:30.562 --> 00:50:33.003]  Oh, Alex, I would never be afraid to come on your show.
[00:50:33.043 --> 00:50:36.825]  I think your show is one of the best shows there is, and the American people know it.
[00:50:36.865 --> 00:50:44.809]  That's why so many people watch your show, because you have courage, and you're willing to talk about things, and explore the issues, and ask questions.
[00:50:45.219 --> 00:50:49.204]  There is nothing wrong with asking questions and digging for the truth.
[00:50:49.565 --> 00:50:51.828]  That's what every single American should do.
[00:50:52.128 --> 00:50:54.511]  And that's what every single member of Congress should do.
[00:50:54.852 --> 00:51:01.400]  Whether the New York Times or CNN or MSNBC or whoever doesn't like it, too bad.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:02.962]  It is our job to do that.
[00:51:03.042 --> 00:51:03.563]  It's our job.
[00:51:03.922 --> 00:51:05.143]  To represent the people.
[00:51:05.283 --> 00:51:06.745]  We don't represent Hollywood.
[00:51:06.785 --> 00:51:08.406]  We don't represent the media.
[00:51:08.667 --> 00:51:10.608]  We don't represent the special interests.
[00:51:10.668 --> 00:51:13.571]  And we sure as heck don't represent some foreign country.
[00:51:13.871 --> 00:51:15.493]  We represent the American people.
[00:51:15.933 --> 00:51:19.717]  And yes, I wish we had more courage here in Washington, D.C.
[00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:22.139]  But unfortunately, we don't see that much.
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.962]  But that's why we also have to challenge one another.
[00:51:24.982 --> 00:51:28.145]  I never mind challenging my own party.
[00:51:28.853 --> 00:51:35.674]  In the same way I would challenge Democrats, because I want my Republican Party to be the party that saves this country.
[00:51:36.014 --> 00:51:38.015]  I want Republicans to do a good job.
[00:51:38.515 --> 00:51:47.697]  And I think that many of them that have been here so long, maybe have lost sight of how to do that, or for whatever reasons won't do it.
[00:51:47.777 --> 00:51:50.537]  But I really want to see Republicans do a good job.
[00:51:50.857 --> 00:52:03.062]   And I want to see Republicans to be the party that stops This globalization that we are rapidly becoming part of because Joe Biden wants a New World Order and so do most of the Democrats.
[00:52:03.402 --> 00:52:06.444]  But I think it's our responsibility to stop the New World Order.
[00:52:06.504 --> 00:52:08.505]  Absolutely, and everybody should support you.
[00:52:09.085 --> 00:52:11.667]  MTG4America on Getter and so much more.
[00:52:11.727 --> 00:52:13.267]  God bless you and have a great week.
[00:52:13.106 --> 00:52:35.106]  Thank you so much, Congresswoman.
[00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:42.707]   And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, A founding member coin, we would not be on air today.
[00:52:43.127 --> 00:52:50.191]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree coin, is being offered and it will probably sell out in 10 days again.
[00:52:50.551 --> 00:52:52.612]  It certainly needs to, to fund our operation.
[00:52:53.032 --> 00:52:54.633]  It is so historic.
[00:52:54.953 --> 00:53:01.378]  And it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty being refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants and more.
[00:53:01.879 --> 00:53:05.562]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[00:53:05.882 --> 00:53:07.824]  It's also at infowarsstore.com.
[00:53:08.124 --> 00:53:08.785]  It's amazing.
[00:53:09.065 --> 00:53:10.566]  There's only 10,000 of them.
[00:53:10.886 --> 00:53:18.613]  And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air, we're planning something very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[00:53:18.933 --> 00:53:21.675]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[00:53:23.817 --> 00:53:30.422]  All right, we got one of my favorite guests, Dr. Zelenko, joining us to cover the waterfront with a post-COVID thing.
[00:53:30.482 --> 00:53:40.889]  It's proven mass death, mass cancer, HIV, vaccine-induced AIDS, VAIDs.
[00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:47.994]  I mean, we cannot stop talking about this while we're being diverted with the Ukraine war and all the other huge news that's unfolding.
[00:53:48.014 --> 00:53:49.175]  But let me do this right now.
[00:53:50.162 --> 00:53:54.265]  Because there is a lot we need to get to and get to pronto.
[00:53:55.866 --> 00:53:59.969]  Let me just hit some of what we're going to be covering with Zelenko and just some of these headlines.
[00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:02.951]  Now, we told you months ago with whistleblowers from China.
[00:54:03.471 --> 00:54:11.776]  We told you weeks ago and then again yesterday with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny that they're hyping up hemorrhagic fever, the Ebola class, as the next lockdown.
[00:54:12.757 --> 00:54:18.241]  London Guardian, woman in UK diagnosed with Congo hemorrhagic fever.
[00:54:20.114 --> 00:54:21.955]  Crimean Congo, hemorrhagic fever.
[00:54:22.515 --> 00:54:23.696]  Second time in history.
[00:54:25.376 --> 00:54:29.978]  CDC tells New York Times it hid corona data for political reasons.
[00:54:30.018 --> 00:54:32.640]  We already told you that, but now that's mainstream news.
[00:54:35.101 --> 00:54:35.521]  Unbelievable.
[00:54:35.541 --> 00:54:36.681]  There's the New York Times admitting it.
[00:54:38.682 --> 00:54:40.003]  mRNA madness.
[00:54:40.223 --> 00:54:43.204]  FDA authorizes both fourth and fifth COVID shots.
[00:54:44.125 --> 00:54:45.485]  And now they're pushing them on children.
[00:54:45.685 --> 00:54:47.006]  I mean, just incredible.
[00:54:48.191 --> 00:54:50.972]  Cruise ship reports COVID-19 outbreak in San Francisco.
[00:54:51.212 --> 00:54:54.714]  Everyone was certified double and triple jab to get on board.
[00:54:57.735 --> 00:55:04.918]  And then there's all these clips in Australia where they admit record death, record illness in the vaccinated, confirming all of it.
[00:55:06.038 --> 00:55:10.160]  And Pfizer trying to suppress all of these documents.
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:12.841]  I mean, it's just they did it.
[00:55:13.141 --> 00:55:14.001]  They launched the attack.
[00:55:14.061 --> 00:55:16.122]  They absolutely did it.
[00:55:18.171 --> 00:55:18.832]  To humanity.
[00:55:22.374 --> 00:55:30.040]  And some of these headlines are just mind-blowing when you realize that they actually did this to us.
[00:55:31.421 --> 00:55:33.363]  They actually launched this globalist attack.
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:36.601]  And there's articles everywhere.
[00:55:37.082 --> 00:55:39.424]  Oh, younger people, older people, children!
[00:55:39.904 --> 00:55:42.246]  They're now having increased heart attacks and strokes!
[00:55:42.847 --> 00:55:47.771]  When it's in the insert that this does it to you, the Pfizer-Moderna shots, Leningradian again.
[00:55:48.071 --> 00:55:52.315]  Hotter nights, increased risk of death from heart disease for men in early 60s.
[00:55:52.975 --> 00:55:56.018]  Suddenly record numbers in them, and then it's the children!
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:02.564]  Seven-year-old boy in Essex Academy, vaccinated from the shot, with the shot.
[00:56:05.871 --> 00:56:13.417]  Seven-year-old boy at Essex Academy school run dies of a suspected heart attack during his lunch break.
[00:56:13.637 --> 00:56:14.157]  Wow.
[00:56:15.799 --> 00:56:16.639]  There it all is.
[00:56:16.719 --> 00:56:18.781]  Just so incredible.
[00:56:18.801 --> 00:56:24.685]  Meanwhile, still in Austria, they tackle and beat people up that aren't wearing masks in public.
[00:56:24.825 --> 00:56:25.566]  What a cult.
[00:56:26.647 --> 00:56:29.169]  What a cult of control.
[00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:30.710]  Truly.
[00:56:32.113 --> 00:56:33.434]  Dangerous, truly historic.
[00:56:33.474 --> 00:56:45.839]  We're living through all this, but mainstream media gaslights everybody and just behaves like this is normal, that this is no big deal, but all of it is an assault on humanity.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.721]  And boy, you talk about an example of that.
[00:56:51.322 --> 00:56:53.103]  Big article up on Infowars.com.
[00:56:53.943 --> 00:56:57.185]  World facing food shortages, not just price issues.
[00:56:57.585 --> 00:57:08.290]   Top UN official warns that Hundreds of millions are on the verge of starvation and that 200 million will starve to death if this continues in the next year, which is by design.
[00:57:10.271 --> 00:57:16.795]  Meanwhile, food rationing, food vouchers, and hunger will become normalized for the next war phase of the plandemic.
[00:57:17.216 --> 00:57:29.033]   They will starve out the world to usher in the financial reset and the digital Identity control grid, which is all being announced and is all being set up.
[00:57:29.234 --> 00:57:29.514]  U.S.
[00:57:29.554 --> 00:57:36.560]  households face $5,200 inflation tax this year, bare minimum, and that's only from current numbers.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.241]  UK and World Economic Forum to lead.
[00:57:40.681 --> 00:57:52.383]  Oh, the World Economic Forum is leading the government to lead regulation, revolution, to foster industries of the future, to cut carbon, which puts us into a total depression.
[00:57:53.384 --> 00:58:00.425]  There's this incredible World Economic Forum clip called World Government Summit, where they announce all of it out in the open.
[00:58:00.465 --> 00:58:01.486]  In fact, get that clip, folks.
[00:58:01.546 --> 00:58:02.266]  I didn't see it on my list.
[00:58:02.286 --> 00:58:02.826]  I want to play that.
[00:58:04.704 --> 00:58:11.027]  Bank of England says energy prices will hit Britain harder than even the 1970s inflation and energy crunch.
[00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:11.628]  Yes!
[00:58:12.728 --> 00:58:20.452]  Russian foreign minister releases alleged bioweapon timeline of US bioresearch in Ukraine and so much more.
[00:58:20.512 --> 00:58:32.499]  And the UK government also, same thing's happening here, is announcing new digital currency tokens to replace the pound that will track where you go and what you do and they'll decide what you can spend it on.
[00:58:33.592 --> 00:58:35.013]  And have total surveillance of you.
[00:58:35.634 --> 00:58:40.718]  Folks, if you put up with this nightmare, you deserve what happens 110%.
[00:58:41.258 --> 00:58:46.882]  And if you think it's just going to be the third world that starves to death, think again.
[00:58:48.664 --> 00:58:52.787]  That's just some of the news and information we've got to break down today.
[00:58:52.827 --> 00:59:00.053]  Dr. Zelenko is going to be covering this and AIDS, which even mainline science is admitting is exploding.
[00:59:01.234 --> 00:59:02.535]  Vaccine-induced AIDS.
[00:59:03.939 --> 00:59:04.761]  That is coming up.
[00:59:04.781 --> 00:59:05.903]  We're going to tie it all together.
[00:59:05.923 --> 00:59:11.576]  You know, I made jokes years ago that they're going to ban the letter W because it starts with white.
[00:59:11.976 --> 00:59:13.780]  Or you could use it spelling the word white.
[00:59:14.855 --> 00:59:18.297]  They've already banned emojis, you name it, of okay symbol.
[00:59:18.657 --> 00:59:23.299]  Well now in Germany they arrest you if you have the letter Z anywhere where it can be seen.
[00:59:23.839 --> 00:59:31.383]  It is now a hate symbol and a bunch of governmental institutions and websites are now banning the word Z as well.
[00:59:31.402 --> 00:59:37.402]   This is direct attack on reality and on communication and creating a bunch of superstitious brainwashed dumbed-down
[00:59:37.402 --> 00:59:42.052]   idiots That are basically been completely sabotaged into the whole
[00:59:42.052 --> 00:59:49.342]   leftist globalist behavioral psychology operation That'll end up destroying the globalist in the processes as
[00:59:49.342 --> 00:59:55.121]   well So it's all coming up here today and a lot more. I
[00:59:55.121 --> 01:00:02.442]   want to encourage listeners to understand that Info wars is more important than it's ever been and we can't
[01:00:02.442 --> 01:00:08.271]   stay on air without your support and Because we've gotten so lean and and you know so almost not
[01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:11.782]   able to operate It's made me do a lot of accounting and a lot of research
[01:00:11.782 --> 01:00:16.892]   and a lot of looking at our business models And how we fund ourselves we found a lot of issues and most
[01:00:16.892 --> 01:00:21.042]   of the issues most of good things You know are due to my crew and myself and everybody but a
[01:00:21.042 --> 01:00:24.402]   lot of bad things are good to me Due to Alex Jones as well
[01:00:24.878 --> 01:00:29.640]  And a lot of that is, every couple weeks I'm like, man, I love this t-shirt designer.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.861]  I want to design a t-shirt this way.
[01:00:32.882 --> 01:00:36.564]  So I knew we had over a hundred t-shirts in the last few years that I basically designed.
[01:00:36.624 --> 01:00:37.944]  Some are amazing, some are okay.
[01:00:37.984 --> 01:00:43.047]  The point is, is I designed them and I never promote them, as you notice.
[01:00:43.707 --> 01:00:53.994]   And so at InfoWarsTore.com, it turns out we have almost a half million dollars of over 200 designs. I thought it was over 100. Over 200
[01:00:53.994 --> 01:00:59.184]   designs, many of which we only did one run of and I never talked about. There's more than 50 great
[01:00:59.184 --> 01:01:04.875]   t-shirts I've never worn, never had, never promoted on the show that are at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:01:04.875 --> 01:01:09.815]   So the good news is if we even sell those that cost, that gets us a half million
[01:01:09.815 --> 01:01:10.554]  dollars in.
[01:01:10.829 --> 01:01:16.231]  We got about a $200, $300 underage every month to fund this independent operation with all the bandwidth we use.
[01:01:16.471 --> 01:01:17.592]  We're victims of our own success.
[01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:26.888]   So, I'm going to try to create a page, DemfulWorkstore.com, in the next few days that has the Two hundred and twenty-something shirts, which are all basically special edition.
[01:01:27.128 --> 01:01:41.432]  In fact, I made the decision, even the old classics, shirts I designed 25, 26 years ago, like Mass Murderers Agree, Gun Control Works, all of them are limited edition now, and it's the last run of all of these shirts, ball caps, everything.
[01:01:41.892 --> 01:01:46.553]  In the future, we're going to have limited editions for like a month or two of one or two shirts, and that's it.
[01:01:46.813 --> 01:01:49.894]  That's how you're supposed to do it to fund your operation and get the word out.
[01:01:51.331 --> 01:01:56.413]  If you want these limited edition and help keep us on air and get them at cost, almost all of them are set at cost.
[01:01:56.453 --> 01:01:57.774]  If they aren't, we're having them set at that.
[01:01:58.054 --> 01:02:01.896]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com and get some of these amazing t-shirts.
[01:02:01.916 --> 01:02:02.856]  A lot of them are designer.
[01:02:03.156 --> 01:02:05.598]  Some of them are just, you know, plain Jane, but still have great messages.
[01:02:06.178 --> 01:02:12.181]  Ball caps, Free American shirts, Wake Up shirts, Arrest Fauci shirts, Alex Jones is Right shirts.
[01:02:12.701 --> 01:02:14.922]  They're all there at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:02:15.442 --> 01:02:16.102]  And then that's it!
[01:02:16.343 --> 01:02:18.184]  We're never going to make any of these again.
[01:02:18.444 --> 01:02:19.564]  All of them are limited edition.
[01:02:20.045 --> 01:02:24.167]  Every one of these shirts, even though some of them were staples, we're never going to offer again.
[01:02:24.467 --> 01:02:33.532]  So please, help us stay on air, get these original shirts that are now collector's editions at infowarestore.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:02:33.752 --> 01:02:35.393]  Go poke around the website, check them out.
[01:02:35.733 --> 01:02:36.874]  There's over 200 of them right there.
[01:02:37.675 --> 01:02:39.676]  Well, there have been a lot of champions.
[01:02:40.785 --> 01:02:56.020]  A lot of great men and women in the last 25, 26 months that have really exposed the evil that was this giant depopulation operation that we're still in the middle of, but that because so many people got woken to what was happening, they kind of partially pulled back their attack, their offensive.
[01:02:56.481 --> 01:03:06.595]   But out of all of them, Dr. Zelenko has been the most informative and the most accurate Dr. Vitamir Zemchalenko is here with us.
[01:03:06.635 --> 01:03:20.165]  He's a medical doctor, of course, that pioneered treatments that saved tens of thousands of lives in New York and his patients that then helped trigger really a therapeutic revolution of research that the entire power structure tried to block.
[01:03:20.605 --> 01:03:21.926]  And I wanted him to come on today.
[01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:28.254]  And just talk about how he was right, so he can then tell us about what he thinks is coming in the future.
[01:03:28.274 --> 01:03:29.955]  And he said, yeah, let's not get into me being right.
[01:03:29.995 --> 01:03:31.756]  Everybody knows what we've witnessed here.
[01:03:32.076 --> 01:03:40.718]  Let's move on to the big picture of transhumanism and some of the World Economic Forum people that are promoting statements like, why do we need so many people?
[01:03:40.798 --> 01:03:41.919]  We're about to become gods.
[01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:43.179]  Let's get rid of everyone.
[01:03:43.259 --> 01:03:45.880]  I mean, really evil, sinister stuff.
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:52.202]  That you'd imagine you'd see him like a Marvel Comics supervillain, but it's actually coming out of the Globalist Operation.
[01:03:52.222 --> 01:03:54.483]  So I'm glad he wants to get to that, because I want his take on it.
[01:03:54.883 --> 01:03:56.164]  That was actually on my list of topics.
[01:03:56.204 --> 01:03:58.725]  So, sir, great to have you with us, Dr. Zelenko.
[01:03:58.745 --> 01:04:02.566]  Please try to cut to the heart of it, as you said you wanted to during the break when we talked.
[01:04:02.586 --> 01:04:04.847]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:04:04.887 --> 01:04:05.467]  Thanks for having me.
[01:04:06.508 --> 01:04:10.369]  So the enemy is godless.
[01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:12.970]  Doesn't believe in an afterlife.
[01:04:14.031 --> 01:04:14.871]  But they don't want to die.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:22.865]  And if you ask them what happens to consciousness after you die, they say it just ceases to be.
[01:04:23.986 --> 01:04:32.873]  And so what they're trying to do for the last 30 years is to create a way to escape death.
[01:04:33.273 --> 01:04:35.655]  I know it sounds weird, but that's exactly what they're trying to do.
[01:04:36.236 --> 01:04:44.843]  I don't think they'll succeed, but we need to understand the motivations of the enemy so that we can have a rational and good strategic response.
[01:04:45.692 --> 01:05:15.504]   And so, if you listen to people like Ray Kurzweil and someone else whose name is Yuval Noah Harari, which we'll talk about more in a minute, what they're trying to do is create an inorganic, organic platform, humanoid platform, that has artificial intelligence where human consciousness could literally be downloaded into, and so that the self-proclaimed elites We'll then have a platform for eternal life.
[01:05:16.244 --> 01:05:25.127]  And because they have a problem that the physical body that we live in only has a limited lifespan, 50 years, 100 years, whatever it is, it's finite.
[01:05:25.607 --> 01:05:34.049]  And so they, when this body begins to fail, they want to be able to download or transfer their consciousness into a humanoid platform.
[01:05:34.649 --> 01:05:39.931]  And then eventually over time into other humanoid platforms, you know, upgrades, so to speak.
[01:05:40.529 --> 01:05:51.038]  Now, this is exactly what their agenda is, because they know that, or they believe at least, that if they were to die, that they would cease to be.
[01:05:52.159 --> 01:06:06.310]  Now, in that worldview, they are prepared to waste 6.5 billion people, because it's completely unnecessary, useless eaters, and they don't need that many slaves.
[01:06:07.211 --> 01:06:15.071]   And so what this vaccine platform has been, These vaccines do a lot of things, except one thing, prevent COVID-19.
[01:06:16.412 --> 01:06:20.553]  There are three simultaneous capabilities that these vaccines do.
[01:06:21.094 --> 01:06:28.317]  One is population control, and that's done through four different phenomenon.
[01:06:28.437 --> 01:06:34.159]  One is a percentage of people die relatively soon after getting injected.
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:41.312]   Long-term lifespans are being reduced Because of chronic diseases such as cancer and autoimmune diseases.
[01:06:42.753 --> 01:06:51.036]  There's miscarriage rates that are skyrocketing from 10 to 82% and actually recent DOD data, Department of Defense data, say over 300%.
[01:06:51.857 --> 01:06:53.017]  And then there's infertility.
[01:06:53.837 --> 01:06:56.999]  All this was predicted by the FDA in October 2020.
[01:06:57.339 --> 01:07:01.581]  This was not an accidental finding.
[01:07:01.621 --> 01:07:13.978]   This was a premeditated plan Proven by the fact that the FDA reported that this was going to happen to its scientists two months prior to the rollout.
[01:07:14.738 --> 01:07:17.120]  And now we have 15 months of data that corroborate this.
[01:07:17.821 --> 01:07:53.637]   Number two, there is an enslavement component here, a control mechanism, a 24-7 surveillance component about bringing The ability to measure biometric data under the skin and then transmit that data to a third party with your location, and then the linkage of that to cryptocurrency, which in 2026, according to congressional data, when Medicare begins to fail and the world economies become unstable, there will be a, you never let a good crisis go to waste.
[01:07:54.798 --> 01:08:08.355]   There'll be a transition from the current economic system to a one world Cryptocurrency based financial system, which will then create a mechanism for control of human behavior.
[01:08:08.395 --> 01:08:16.799]  Because if the powers that be that could control the system don't like you, they just turn off your ability to buy bread for your family.
[01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:40.914]   And then the third most sinister component to this is the transhumanist component or the ability to hack into Your genetic code using an mRNA platform to deliver CRISPR-Cas9 technology and gene edit you so that you're no longer made in the image of God, but you're made in the image of Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates.
[01:08:40.934 --> 01:08:44.357]  They're literally going to re-engineer what it means to be human.
[01:08:44.377 --> 01:09:13.144]   And so this Yuval Noah Harari is a wayward Jew from Israel, professor of History at Hebrew University, and he's called the prophet by people like Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates... That's right, they call him basically their high priest, and he says stuff that, quite frankly, sounds like it came out of the mouth of Hitler, like, we don't need most people, we're about to become gods, this is dangerous.
[01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:17.065]  And Obama, Obama called him his favorite author on CNN.
[01:09:17.805 --> 01:09:18.945]  And so what does this guy say?
[01:09:19.825 --> 01:09:30.252]   Well, he says that humans are hackable animals, And since we can hack into your genetic code, we could re-engineer it with intelligent design.
[01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:41.180]  But not with some God-above-the-clouds intelligent design, but rather by human intelligent design, because we are now like gods.
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.221]  There's no such thing as a soul.
[01:09:43.602 --> 01:09:45.163]  There's no such thing as free will.
[01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:56.305]  These are just some of the tidbits of what this guy... This is literally Genesis out of one of the oldest Jewish books, telling us the serpent said it, and now he's saying it right now.
[01:09:58.305 --> 01:09:59.086]  Well, he is a serpent.
[01:09:59.106 --> 01:10:00.486]  He's the embodiment of the serpent.
[01:10:01.306 --> 01:10:07.568]  And it's very actually relieving to me that the enemy has finally exposed himself.
[01:10:08.393 --> 01:10:20.058]  Because he's just one little man, but he represents an ideology that we have allowed to exist through the godless vacuum that we have created in the world, in society.
[01:10:20.538 --> 01:10:32.204]  He is the inevitable outcome of a society that has allowed for the desecration of the sanctity of life, the sanctity of marriage, and the sanctity of gender.
[01:10:32.744 --> 01:10:34.805]  You're saying we've conjured him by our sin?
[01:10:37.799 --> 01:10:44.148]  We allow for darkness to exist if we do not bring light into the world.
[01:10:45.063 --> 01:10:45.463]  Powerful.
[01:10:45.503 --> 01:10:45.864]  Stay there.
[01:10:45.884 --> 01:10:50.187]  I want to get into this because I watch his whole speeches and they're so satanic.
[01:10:50.227 --> 01:10:51.068]  It makes your head spin.
[01:10:51.428 --> 01:10:53.490]  And there's Klaus Schwab drooling while he speaks.
[01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:56.592]  And so they definitely worship this guy.
[01:10:57.092 --> 01:11:00.455]  And we're going to talk about what he believes on the other side with Dr. Zelenko.
[01:11:00.475 --> 01:11:02.096]  This is so important.
[01:11:02.116 --> 01:11:04.218]  You can find Dr. Zelenko's site on screen.
[01:11:04.238 --> 01:11:06.180]  When we come back, we'll tell you about that as well.
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:08.241]  This is an incredible time.
[01:11:08.742 --> 01:11:10.463]  Everything is coming to a head, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:11.103 --> 01:11:13.565]  This is the battle of the gods, whatever you want to call it.
[01:11:13.605 --> 01:11:14.026]  It's happening.
[01:11:15.987 --> 01:11:19.089]  Yuval Noah Harari is the high priest.
[01:11:19.109 --> 01:11:22.532]  They call him the leader, the prophet of Klaus Schwab.
[01:11:23.072 --> 01:11:24.453]  They just fall over themselves.
[01:11:24.513 --> 01:11:27.495]  I watched the video of Hollywood and Schwab.
[01:11:27.535 --> 01:11:28.716]  They just grovel to him.
[01:11:29.777 --> 01:11:32.458]  And he sits there and tells them, why do we need so many people?
[01:11:32.499 --> 01:11:33.379]  Why do we need all this?
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.681]  And this is the transhumanist cult.
[01:11:35.861 --> 01:11:38.443]  Everything they're doing is coming out of this plan.
[01:11:38.763 --> 01:11:40.004]  Here's just a few of the clips.
[01:11:40.124 --> 01:11:41.105]  You can't do it justice.
[01:11:41.625 --> 01:11:43.666]  Everything he says is just so freaking evil.
[01:11:43.706 --> 01:11:44.027]  Here it is.
[01:11:45.068 --> 01:11:52.160]  And then the big political and economic question of the 21st century will be, what do we need humans for?
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:55.425]  Or at least, what do we need so many humans for?
[01:11:55.465 --> 01:11:56.667]  Do you have an answer in the book?
[01:11:58.162 --> 01:12:03.946]  At present, the best guess we have is keep them happy with drugs and computer games.
[01:12:04.226 --> 01:12:05.747]  We call this the metaverse.
[01:12:06.168 --> 01:12:07.288]  What you guys doing here?
[01:12:07.308 --> 01:12:09.950]  Pretty much everything that you would do in the real world.
[01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:13.052]  Or at least, what do we need so many humans for?
[01:12:13.432 --> 01:12:16.194]  Would constitute a new useless class.
[01:12:16.514 --> 01:12:22.958]  When I say that these are useless humans, it's not from the viewpoint of the mother, of the wife, or the son.
[01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:27.261]  Or at least, what do we need so many humans for?
[01:12:27.521 --> 01:12:29.002]  First, we've got population.
[01:12:29.623 --> 01:12:32.044]  Now, the world today has 6.8 billion people.
[01:12:32.505 --> 01:12:34.106]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[01:12:34.726 --> 01:12:43.832]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[01:12:44.052 --> 01:12:46.954]  Or at least, what do we need so many humans for?
[01:12:47.254 --> 01:12:48.635]  Forget the conspiracy.
[01:12:48.875 --> 01:12:50.576]  Listen to our government agencies.
[01:12:50.596 --> 01:12:51.817]  These guys are telling the truth.
[01:12:51.837 --> 01:12:54.119]  You know, there's no conspiracy here, folks.
[01:12:54.199 --> 01:12:56.060]  Just get your damn vaccine.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:56.601]  All right.
[01:12:56.681 --> 01:12:57.441]  Thank you, doctor.
[01:12:57.982 --> 01:13:05.587]  And COVID is critical because this is what convinces people to accept, to legitimize.
[01:13:06.704 --> 01:13:08.725]  Total biometric surveillance.
[01:13:08.745 --> 01:13:17.367]  If we want to stop this epidemic, we need not just to monitor people, we need to monitor what's happening under their skin.
[01:13:19.067 --> 01:13:27.170]  What we have seen so far, it's corporations and governments collecting data about where we go, who we meet, what movies we watch.
[01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:32.411]  The next phase is the surveillance going under our skin.
[01:13:33.789 --> 01:13:40.936]  We now see mass surveillance systems established even in democratic countries, which previously rejected them.
[01:13:41.516 --> 01:13:45.219]  And we also see a change in the nature of surveillance.
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:49.383]  Previously, surveillance was mainly above the skin.
[01:13:50.024 --> 01:13:51.806]  Now it's going under the skin.
[01:13:52.887 --> 01:13:56.754]  Governments want to know not just where we go or who we meet.
[01:13:57.134 --> 01:14:00.540]  Above all, they want to know what is happening under our skin.
[01:14:01.201 --> 01:14:02.343]  What's our body temperature?
[01:14:02.784 --> 01:14:03.846]  What's our blood pressure?
[01:14:03.986 --> 01:14:05.369]  What is our medical condition?
[01:14:07.072 --> 01:14:13.739]  Now humans are developing even bigger powers than ever before.
[01:14:14.059 --> 01:14:19.004]  We are really acquiring divine powers of creation and destruction.
[01:14:19.584 --> 01:14:22.347]  We are really upgrading humans into gods.
[01:14:22.867 --> 01:14:26.110]  We are acquiring, for instance, the power to re-engineer life.
[01:14:27.071 --> 01:14:29.554]  Humans are now hackable animals.
[01:14:31.107 --> 01:14:47.173]  You know, the whole idea that humans have, you know, this, they have this soul or spirit and they have free will and nobody knows what's happening inside me, so whatever I choose, whether in the election or whether in the supermarket, this is my free will, that's over.
[01:14:48.773 --> 01:14:53.475]  I mean, all this story about Jesus rising from the dead and being the Son of God, this is fake news.
[01:14:54.941 --> 01:15:07.107]  I know that in recent years we saw populist politicians undermining deliberately the trust that people have in important institutions like universities, like respectable media outlets.
[01:15:07.368 --> 01:15:13.091]   These populist politicians told people that, say, scientists are these Small elite.
[01:15:13.111 --> 01:15:18.996]  So I apologize for subjecting you to that, but it's only a small portion of it, but I wanted you to see what Dr. Zelenko was talking about.
[01:15:19.096 --> 01:15:23.700]  So what, obviously listeners know this is horrific, but what are we hearing here?
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:28.584]  Because this is an open, in my view, declaration of war against our very existence.
[01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:31.527]  And hey, he said your free will, forget about it, it's gone.
[01:15:31.947 --> 01:15:34.930]  Well, that doesn't sound like something a good guy says to me, Dr. Zelenko.
[01:15:36.651 --> 01:15:37.792]  You really want to know what motivates him?
[01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:39.474]  What?
[01:15:41.596 --> 01:15:44.617]  So he's a brilliant man.
[01:15:45.518 --> 01:15:49.459]  I think it's important to respect your adversary and their capabilities.
[01:15:49.499 --> 01:15:50.799]  He has a PhD from Oxford.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:54.101]  He's influenced the most powerful people in the world.
[01:15:55.181 --> 01:15:58.562]  But what really motivates him is something much more simple.
[01:15:59.663 --> 01:16:00.223]  He's learned.
[01:16:00.283 --> 01:16:01.403]  He knows the Bible very well.
[01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:10.767]  And if he knows the Bible very well, he knows what God says, or what is stated in the Bible, what is right and what is wrong.
[01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:18.012]  Now, I'm going to say this, not because I'm placing a value judgment, but because how he interprets it.
[01:16:18.692 --> 01:16:22.735]  Now, I personally believe people can live any way they want, and it's between them and God.
[01:16:22.755 --> 01:16:25.177]  So I'm not God's policeman.
[01:16:25.857 --> 01:16:30.621]  But he's a homosexual, and he's married to someone, a man, his name is Yitzhak.
[01:16:31.241 --> 01:16:35.504]  And he knows what the Bible... He mentioned it earlier, he has real problems with it.
[01:16:36.025 --> 01:16:44.637]   He knows what the Bible says about homosexuality, it's called an abomination, and it really Really pisses him off.
[01:16:45.978 --> 01:16:50.040]  And so from his world view, it's not enough.
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:53.221]  Go live your life quietly, any way you want.
[01:16:53.362 --> 01:16:53.582]  No.
[01:16:54.062 --> 01:16:55.923]  He decided that he's going to take on God.
[01:16:57.103 --> 01:17:04.347]  And he's going to invalidate the concept of God in people's minds.
[01:17:04.387 --> 01:17:06.848]  Because in his world view, God cannot exist.
[01:17:08.004 --> 01:17:12.827]  Because if God exists and there's a right and wrong, then he has a big problem in his mind.
[01:17:13.167 --> 01:17:18.931]  There's this cognitive dissonance, and then there's this emotional turbulence and guilt, and he gets anxious.
[01:17:19.851 --> 01:17:37.362]  So literally the whole world has to suffer, because you will know Arari's sexual orientation is not in line with what he read in the Bible, and therefore he has to try to destroy God-consciousness in humanity.
[01:17:38.883 --> 01:17:40.504]  I mean, that's really exactly what it is.
[01:17:40.544 --> 01:17:44.207]  They are in rebellion against the code we've been given to be successful.
[01:17:44.608 --> 01:17:46.029]  We have free will to follow it or not.
[01:17:46.409 --> 01:17:53.835]  And he has decided to not just rebel, but to go 180 degrees in the opposite direction, which is extremely powerful, because it's Antichrist.
[01:17:54.496 --> 01:17:55.357]  Or it's anti-human.
[01:17:55.397 --> 01:17:56.898]  It's anti-God consciousness.
[01:17:58.899 --> 01:18:02.322]  And so, again, we're all complex beings.
[01:18:02.763 --> 01:18:03.723]  I know I'm not perfect.
[01:18:03.743 --> 01:18:04.524]  Maybe you are, Alex.
[01:18:04.604 --> 01:18:05.425]  No, I'm certainly not.
[01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:09.090]  I have my demons that I have to deal with also.
[01:18:09.691 --> 01:18:14.831]  But I do it in private, and I try to work out my relationship with God in private.
[01:18:15.311 --> 01:18:31.514]  And I'm not judging Yuval Noah Harari until he takes the war against God into the world, and his policies will result in the extermination of 6.5 billion people, at least.
[01:18:32.394 --> 01:18:35.915]  And so this cannot be allowed to go on.
[01:18:36.693 --> 01:18:56.671]   His ideology and his arrogance to believe that human beings are now gods is Incompatible with decency, incompatible with societal living, incompatible with God's will, and cannot be allowed to go on.
[01:18:57.051 --> 01:19:02.212]  And doesn't the serpent say, no, not you are a God, you're going to live forever, eat of this.
[01:19:02.232 --> 01:19:05.293]  I mean, it's literally be God, take over.
[01:19:05.553 --> 01:19:07.914]  But it's not God because God gives us free will.
[01:19:08.214 --> 01:19:10.874]  He says you don't get free will, which proves he's not God.
[01:19:11.495 --> 01:19:13.295]  He's saying, I'm going to take your free will.
[01:19:15.342 --> 01:19:18.503]  You know, that's how the serpent seduced the woman.
[01:19:18.543 --> 01:19:24.845]  But, you know, the human being was meant to live forever.
[01:19:25.985 --> 01:19:33.347]  God said in the Bible, in Genesis, that if you were to eat from this fruit, then on that day you should surely die.
[01:19:34.507 --> 01:19:37.988]  And so there's a very interesting question that arises.
[01:19:38.408 --> 01:19:40.009]  There were two trees in the Garden of Eden.
[01:19:40.129 --> 01:19:45.050]  There was one, the tree of knowledge of good and bad, which they were not supposed to eat from.
[01:19:45.973 --> 01:19:47.274]  And then there was the Tree of Life.
[01:19:48.936 --> 01:19:54.061]  And so after the sin, there is a conversation between God and His angels.
[01:19:54.081 --> 01:20:03.830]  It says, let's evict the man and his wife from the Garden of Eden, lest he eat from the Tree of Life and live forever.
[01:20:04.810 --> 01:20:05.951]  So there's an interesting question.
[01:20:06.072 --> 01:20:07.373]  He was supposed to live forever.
[01:20:08.214 --> 01:20:09.094]  And then there was a sin.
[01:20:10.115 --> 01:20:11.757]  So why not let him repent?
[01:20:12.711 --> 01:20:14.051]  And let him live forever again.
[01:20:14.071 --> 01:20:15.532]  What's the whole point?
[01:20:15.612 --> 01:20:16.412]  Why evict him?
[01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:21.573]  Why is God so concerned that he would eat from the tree of life and live forever?
[01:20:22.153 --> 01:20:23.514]  So one of the answers is the following.
[01:20:24.014 --> 01:20:30.775]  That since they ate from the tree of life, from the tree of knowledge of good and bad, evil entered them.
[01:20:33.416 --> 01:20:33.596]  Us!
[01:20:34.416 --> 01:20:35.477]  Stay there, we gotta go to break.
[01:20:35.837 --> 01:20:37.877]  And we can't give evil eternal life.
[01:20:37.897 --> 01:20:38.657]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:38.978 --> 01:20:40.698]  We've thrown away our birthright, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:41.872 --> 01:20:44.013]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:20:45.054 --> 01:20:48.135]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:49.496 --> 01:20:52.117]  ZDtalkslife.com is the website.
[01:20:53.098 --> 01:20:55.059]  Dr. Vladimir Zevzalenko is our guest.
[01:20:55.879 --> 01:20:57.180]  He's with us a little bit in the next hour.
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:59.081]  We have another special guest joining us as well.
[01:20:59.121 --> 01:21:02.142]  But doctor, lay it out for people because you're absolutely right.
[01:21:02.562 --> 01:21:05.604]  The ancient things we heard about are exactly what's currently happening now.
[01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:08.871]  Where do you see all this going?
[01:21:08.891 --> 01:21:11.752]  How should we respond to this?
[01:21:12.312 --> 01:21:14.033]  What other knowledge you want to lay out for people?
[01:21:16.554 --> 01:21:18.075]  I'm optimistic about the future.
[01:21:18.095 --> 01:21:20.996]  I think the true narrative will be revealed.
[01:21:22.577 --> 01:21:23.978]  But let me tell you something very serious.
[01:21:24.378 --> 01:21:27.719]  The only unknown variable here is the body count until we get there.
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:40.396]   And we can mitigate that carnage by spreading the true narrative and giving people The right information so they can make good choices.
[01:21:41.256 --> 01:21:49.237]  Everyone has a absolute right to see both aspects or all the options or all the information about an issue.
[01:21:49.837 --> 01:22:04.340]  What the media has done and what the censorship has done is only given one aspect or one perspective, which has led people to make terrible choices and choices that essentially they choose to walk into a extermination chamber.
[01:22:06.005 --> 01:22:20.875]  And so, by spreading the true narrative, or at least another perspective, then people can use their intellectual powers of analytical thought, deductive reasoning, and come to a decision.
[01:22:21.315 --> 01:22:23.176]  Whatever decision they make, it's on them.
[01:22:23.196 --> 01:22:25.097]  You know, we have free choice.
[01:22:25.238 --> 01:22:26.218]  That's very important.
[01:22:26.578 --> 01:22:31.281]  See, God, the way he created the world, he gave us two very precious gifts.
[01:22:32.022 --> 01:22:33.463]  One is consciousness of self.
[01:22:34.389 --> 01:22:36.089]  And two, it's a free choice.
[01:22:36.649 --> 01:22:40.290]  Those are two uniquely divine characteristics.
[01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:45.271]  Now, for choice to exist, there has to be options.
[01:22:45.511 --> 01:22:51.492]  Now, listen, if I gave you a hundred dollar bill and a dollar bill and asked you to choose, really it's not a choice, is it?
[01:22:51.932 --> 01:22:54.693]  Because one is much more attractive than the other.
[01:22:55.353 --> 01:23:05.236]   And so, for real choice to exist, there has to be two options that are of comparable Perceived as real.
[01:23:06.156 --> 01:23:11.880]  And so good and evil are very real in the consciousness of man.
[01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:25.507]  But again, the idea is that, I'll give you a parable that's used a lot, that there is a king and he has a son, and the prince is meant to be king, but the king loves his people.
[01:23:25.927 --> 01:23:35.061]   So he wants to make sure that the prince is a proper moral fiber that That he's fitting to rule the people.
[01:23:35.722 --> 01:23:43.668]  And so he hires or he gets a prostitute and orders the prostitute to seduce the prince.
[01:23:44.529 --> 01:23:45.669]  That's the parallel.
[01:23:45.850 --> 01:23:48.231]  If we analyze it, I'll ask you a simple question.
[01:23:48.251 --> 01:23:50.033]  Does the king want the prince to sin?
[01:23:50.053 --> 01:23:50.973]  No.
[01:23:51.814 --> 01:23:54.916]  Does the prostitute want the prince to sin?
[01:23:55.557 --> 01:23:57.598]  Actually, in many ways, she's doing the will of the king.
[01:23:58.639 --> 01:24:00.661]  And so the answer is also no.
[01:24:01.684 --> 01:24:06.848]  And so, God creates options, but it doesn't mean that He wants us to choose the dark side.
[01:24:07.648 --> 01:24:10.770]  He wants us to turn away from bad and to choose Him.
[01:24:12.111 --> 01:24:23.119]  And by doing that, we earn for ourselves the ultimate relationship and oneness with Him, with the Eternal, with the Infinite.
[01:24:23.799 --> 01:24:30.924]  And that's amazing, because during a finite life of a few number of years, we have an opportunity to connect to the Eternal.
[01:24:31.297 --> 01:24:32.698]  Wow, it's really amazing.
[01:24:33.258 --> 01:24:35.959]  And so, that's the game that we're playing.
[01:24:36.039 --> 01:24:37.059]  It's a real game.
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.761]  And that's what's crazy, Dr. Dinnerup, real quick.
[01:24:40.421 --> 01:24:44.002]  Everything the New World Order transhumanist does, like, follows Genesis.
[01:24:44.663 --> 01:24:46.183]  And, like, we're going to make you live forever.
[01:24:46.283 --> 01:24:48.964]  Just do what we say, and you're going to have this knowledge.
[01:24:48.984 --> 01:24:50.305]  But, oh, everybody else can't do it.
[01:24:50.325 --> 01:24:51.485]  You've got to kill all these people.
[01:24:51.505 --> 01:24:55.227]  I mean, it's so obvious that it's literally being fulfilled.
[01:24:55.267 --> 01:24:55.947]  It's powerful.
[01:24:57.368 --> 01:25:05.753]   You know, the New World Order is a rebranding of the oldest world order of paganism, idolatry, and child sacrifice.
[01:25:06.133 --> 01:25:06.953]  There's nothing new here.
[01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:12.854]  These, they call themselves elites or globalists or illuminated people.
[01:25:13.254 --> 01:25:17.615]  They're nothing more than just devolved pagans of yesteryear.
[01:25:18.255 --> 01:25:22.616]  And so it's very obvious what they are.
[01:25:23.176 --> 01:25:40.924]   The problem is we have become complacent and we have allowed for Through our choices for the slaughtering of the unborn, desecration of marriage, desecration of gender, and blasphemy of the Creator.
[01:25:42.125 --> 01:25:43.126]  And what do you think?
[01:25:43.146 --> 01:25:44.607]  That's going to bring blessing into the country?
[01:25:45.488 --> 01:25:53.375]  And so what we need to do is reconcile en masse with our Creator.
[01:25:54.516 --> 01:26:04.512]   When we cross a certain threshold of That's right.
[01:26:05.313 --> 01:26:15.859]  We have to, through free will, choose God, God-consciousness, say we're sorry, ask God to help us, and that's when things start to change.
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:17.280]  Exactly.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:22.263]  And the best way to do that is to live by an example.
[01:26:22.763 --> 01:26:24.724]  You can't preach to others and not do it yourself.
[01:26:27.722 --> 01:26:40.512]  But the people I'm drawn to most are those that really are humble and work on themselves and find a certain degree of serenity and tranquility, which is extremely attractive, and especially in a world of chaos.
[01:26:40.933 --> 01:26:42.994]  And it makes me curious, what do they know that I don't?
[01:26:43.715 --> 01:26:47.198]  And so that draws me in into a process of self-retirement.
[01:26:47.938 --> 01:26:57.961]   So the problem with modern-day institutions, whether it's religious, academic, Political, industrial, it doesn't really matter.
[01:26:57.981 --> 01:27:00.141]  They're all corrupted by the same serpent.
[01:27:01.142 --> 01:27:04.143]  Anything that's institutionalized has been hijacked.
[01:27:04.983 --> 01:27:08.105]  And so it's most tragic when it's in the religious realms.
[01:27:08.605 --> 01:27:16.188]  Because they, actually what they do, the one place of salvation is used to desecrate in the name of God and enslave people.
[01:27:17.128 --> 01:27:26.654]  I'll only talk about my religion because I don't feel comfortable talking about others, but I've seen such tyranny in the last two years within the Jewish faith.
[01:27:26.694 --> 01:27:30.736]  You know, people couldn't go to... Well, I mean, look at Israel.
[01:27:30.776 --> 01:27:33.718]  There's obviously a new extermination going on.
[01:27:33.758 --> 01:27:34.478]  It's so obvious.
[01:27:35.659 --> 01:27:36.419]  What's happening there?
[01:27:36.459 --> 01:27:37.980]  You've talked about that, though.
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:44.744]  The most oppressed people right now in the world under COVID tyranny are Israel and then Australia and maybe Austria.
[01:27:44.784 --> 01:27:45.985]  What's happening there?
[01:27:47.278 --> 01:27:53.640]  Well, half of Israel has AIDS and vaccine-induced immune deficiency syndrome.
[01:27:53.821 --> 01:27:54.901]  I didn't say HIV.
[01:27:54.961 --> 01:27:55.901]  They don't have HIV.
[01:27:56.442 --> 01:27:59.823]  But half of Israel, their immune systems.
[01:28:00.379 --> 01:28:01.580]  They're innate immune systems.
[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:07.625]  They're T cell function, natural killer cell function, macrophages, tumor suppressor genes.
[01:28:07.865 --> 01:28:12.209]  So why again is the globalist force attacking the Jews?
[01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:13.050]  Because I mean it really is.
[01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:14.671]  You can see it right there.
[01:28:14.731 --> 01:28:18.014]  Like literally the main attack out of all everywhere is Israel.
[01:28:18.054 --> 01:28:20.776]  That's where they're like on their fifth and sixth shots right now.
[01:28:23.299 --> 01:28:40.140]   So I always delineate the state of Israel from The biblical people of Israel, the two different entities, the state of Israel is a secular socialist entity and the Jewish people biblically have been tasked with the role of being a light unto the nations.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:48.824]  And so, you're going to tell me if I'm wrong, good Jews have been led there to try to be close to God, but the evil runs the political system and is now going to try to kill them.
[01:28:50.565 --> 01:28:55.568]  Oh yes, I really think that what Hitler started, the Israeli government is finishing.
[01:28:56.257 --> 01:28:57.117]  Wow, yeah.
[01:28:57.557 --> 01:28:58.438]  That's what I see as well.
[01:28:58.478 --> 01:28:59.578]  This is so diabolical.
[01:28:59.898 --> 01:29:01.418]  What would you advise Israelis to do?
[01:29:04.659 --> 01:29:05.099]  Revolt.
[01:29:06.419 --> 01:29:07.020]  Civil war.
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:10.561]  To not comply with mandates.
[01:29:10.921 --> 01:29:16.882]  By the way, I'm talking about my own brothers and sisters, literally, who have been enslaved and poisoned.
[01:29:17.702 --> 01:29:19.583]  I mean, this is not theoretical.
[01:29:19.943 --> 01:29:21.463]  These are my relatives.
[01:29:21.603 --> 01:29:23.864]  Oh, I've had family die of the shot, Dr. Zelenko.
[01:29:23.924 --> 01:29:24.544]  I know, it's real.
[01:29:29.167 --> 01:29:34.011]  So, I think that family nowadays is a different concept.
[01:29:34.671 --> 01:29:51.845]  Family, I would define as those people that are ideologically or theologically aligned in trying to live in a world of God-consciousness and trying to maintain the possibility of freedom in this world.
[01:29:52.266 --> 01:30:02.611]   And the people that are walking away from God-consciousness are choosing to enslave themselves to really Sociopaths, and they become codependent on this cult.
[01:30:04.052 --> 01:30:07.394]  There's only one free type of person in this world, Alex, in my opinion.
[01:30:07.534 --> 01:30:10.355]  Someone who chooses to be a servant of God.
[01:30:10.375 --> 01:30:11.176]  That's right.
[01:30:13.297 --> 01:30:14.898]  The operative word here is chooses, by the way.
[01:30:15.638 --> 01:30:19.360]  And so, I think each human being is being tested.
[01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:20.941]  We are being tested.
[01:30:21.261 --> 01:30:23.042]  God is the floodwaters arising.
[01:30:23.883 --> 01:30:25.944]  And this time around, God is saying, get on the ark.
[01:30:26.564 --> 01:30:27.305]  You don't have to drown.
[01:30:28.664 --> 01:30:30.725]  But the world will be cleaned up.
[01:30:31.345 --> 01:30:32.185]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:30:32.345 --> 01:30:32.925]  Oh, I agree.
[01:30:32.985 --> 01:30:34.365]  This thing's not going to succeed.
[01:30:34.866 --> 01:30:41.067]  Dr. Zalinko, you know, we've got ZDtalkslife.com forward slash Alex with your great product for your immune system, your body.
[01:30:41.407 --> 01:30:42.187]  I want to promote that.
[01:30:42.207 --> 01:30:44.588]  I know you didn't come on about that, but you just do a great job.
[01:30:44.628 --> 01:30:46.928]  You were the pioneer of putting things out to protect people.
[01:30:47.289 --> 01:30:51.370]  Now more than ever, they should at ZDtalkslife.com forward slash Alex.
[01:30:51.410 --> 01:30:54.870]  We'll also post it in the live show feed under the show right now.
[01:30:54.930 --> 01:30:59.952]   But I want to come back and just ask you about What you see coming next and how we can get prepared.
[01:31:00.332 --> 01:31:07.095]  Final segment straight ahead, and then we have the big lawyer that's been getting all these big events going, exposing the mass murder.
[01:31:07.696 --> 01:31:09.076]  Joining us, Mr. Fulming.
[01:31:09.476 --> 01:31:10.377]  That's coming up as well.
[01:31:10.397 --> 01:31:10.797]  Stay with us.
[01:31:12.938 --> 01:31:15.259]  Well, you didn't read the Old Testament, so you didn't know.
[01:31:15.279 --> 01:31:20.121]  You read that, you actually know everything that's going to happen, exactly as it's going to happen.
[01:31:20.161 --> 01:31:21.282]  I'm just giving credit where it's due.
[01:31:22.702 --> 01:31:23.823]  And you know, that's that paradox.
[01:31:24.977 --> 01:31:26.638]  There are good Germans, there are bad Germans.
[01:31:26.678 --> 01:31:28.279]  There are good Christians, there are bad Christians.
[01:31:28.299 --> 01:31:29.620]  There are good Jews, there are bad Jews.
[01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:39.525]  But I got to say, Dr. Zelenko, it is amazing that Ezekiel and Moses and everything is just so powerful.
[01:31:40.466 --> 01:31:46.149]  A few minutes, because I know you're a humble person, but how did the Jews particularly foresee all of this?
[01:31:47.530 --> 01:31:51.850]   out of all the cultures because the more I study it, the more those ancient Jews,
[01:31:51.850 --> 01:31:57.130]   5,000, 6,000, 3,000 years ago are dead on. You know, Plato I've given credit to.
[01:31:57.130 --> 01:32:00.890]   Now, he made a lot of predictions, made a lot of things 2,000, 300 years ago. But
[01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:06.409]   so the Greeks you got to give some credit to too. But what's going on with Jews knowing all this
[01:32:06.409 --> 01:32:09.530]   and then somebody like Harari turns his back completely on it?
[01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:18.890]   Jews are absolutely nothing without the law and without obeying the Creator and serving as
[01:32:18.890 --> 01:32:26.649]   a light unto the nations by bringing the knowledge of the Creator into the creation.
[01:32:26.937 --> 01:32:35.324]  And no one is denying that it was the Jewish faith that brought the morality and God's law into the world.
[01:32:36.064 --> 01:32:43.110]  And so, it really starts with the characteristics and attributes of the first Jew, Abraham.
[01:32:43.890 --> 01:32:46.072]  Now, let me just paint a picture of how he grew up.
[01:32:47.671 --> 01:32:48.991]  Well, no one believed in the One God.
[01:32:50.052 --> 01:32:52.192]  Everyone was an idol worshipper, including his own father.
[01:32:53.333 --> 01:32:57.594]  And he sensed, just logically, rationally, that there's something not right here.
[01:32:57.614 --> 01:32:58.594]  It doesn't make sense.
[01:32:59.214 --> 01:33:07.796]  And he used his mind and came to the conclusion that, no, there must be a primal cause, a One God that set everything into motion.
[01:33:08.497 --> 01:33:09.857]  And he went public about that.
[01:33:11.316 --> 01:33:13.658]  And he was not liked.
[01:33:14.318 --> 01:33:16.119]  Actually, the entire world tried to kill him.
[01:33:16.759 --> 01:33:18.300]  And he said, I don't care.
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:25.485]  I'm going to stand up for my principles, my beliefs, and I'm going to sanctify the name of God, even if it costs me my life.
[01:33:26.105 --> 01:33:27.746]  And he was the only one on the planet doing it.
[01:33:28.767 --> 01:33:34.290]  But that was the essence of the stubbornness, this arrogance, but for God.
[01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:38.590]   You know, every attribute could be used for good and for bad.
[01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:44.470]   And if you have an arrogant streak in you, but a stubborn streak, but if you use it to
[01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:47.229]  serve God, then it's not necessarily bad.
[01:33:47.178 --> 01:33:52.503]  And so, Abraham was a stubborn guy, and he stood up to the entire world and said, No!
[01:33:52.523 --> 01:33:54.064]  I'm not going to worship your idols.
[01:33:54.864 --> 01:33:58.527]  You are wrong, and there is a Creator.
[01:33:59.188 --> 01:34:03.311]  So, to answer your question, it's nothing special about us.
[01:34:03.892 --> 01:34:12.738]   It's the fact that we were task put into a role and only when we observe that role is
[01:34:12.738 --> 01:34:17.918]   there a certain grace that's brought into the world. Exactly, only when we're
[01:34:17.918 --> 01:34:24.707]   aligned with the will of God are any of us strong. Correct. I know you gotta go but we got another
[01:34:24.707 --> 01:34:26.648]  guest coming up.
[01:34:24.713 --> 01:34:26.575]  We've got Reiner Fuhlman coming on.
[01:34:26.615 --> 01:34:29.737]  You never plug this stuff, but it's a great product, and you're supporting us.
[01:34:29.777 --> 01:34:31.278]  So do a few more minutes, we'll come back for a break.
[01:34:31.658 --> 01:34:35.220]  I want to talk about Z-Stack and the other products, but start talking about it now.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:37.282]  You've got a new website for it.
[01:34:37.302 --> 01:34:41.784]  It's ZDT, or zdetoxlife.com forward slash Alex.
[01:34:41.824 --> 01:34:42.665]  You're also supporting us.
[01:34:44.386 --> 01:34:47.848]  Doctor, spend a minute or so talking about these products you've got, because you've got a bunch of great products.
[01:34:49.289 --> 01:34:51.731]  Well, NAC is a stop and look box.
[01:34:52.472 --> 01:34:55.935]  And for some reason, there's a lot of blood clots going around lately, killing people, right?
[01:34:56.395 --> 01:34:57.376]  Heart attacks and strokes.
[01:34:57.876 --> 01:35:03.341]  So if you're at risk for blood clots, NAC is an over-the-counter option, which is great.
[01:35:03.979 --> 01:35:11.245]  Then EGCG, it's a green tea extract, is one of the most powerful zinc ionophores that gives zinc into the cell.
[01:35:11.744 --> 01:35:16.543]   and then it has zinc, because zinc stops RNA viruses from replicating it.
[01:35:16.543 --> 01:35:20.644]   Stay there, come back in just two, three minutes we'll be on the other side, ahead of Reimer
[01:35:20.644 --> 01:35:24.284]   Fulmick because I want you to talk about this because I want to run an ad on air because
[01:35:24.284 --> 01:35:25.944]  I know I approached you about being a sponsor.
[01:35:25.936 --> 01:35:26.576]  I love your products.
[01:35:26.596 --> 01:35:27.416]  My family uses them.
[01:35:27.817 --> 01:35:29.977]  My products are great too, but yours are just as good or even better.
[01:35:30.338 --> 01:35:31.298]  I just want people to know about them.
[01:35:31.338 --> 01:35:32.258]  So please humor me.
[01:35:32.579 --> 01:35:33.719]  Let's come back in a minute.
[01:35:33.999 --> 01:35:37.601]  I want you to talk two, three minutes so I can put an ad out of you talking about these great products.
[01:35:37.781 --> 01:35:42.523]  People find it zdetoxlife.com forward slash Alex if people want to support the broadcast.
[01:35:42.543 --> 01:35:45.424]  Whatever you do, boost your immune system now with the things God gave us.
[01:35:45.664 --> 01:35:47.105]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[01:35:46.925 --> 01:35:49.164]  Thank you, stay with us.
[01:35:49.164 --> 01:35:58.604]  Introducing the newest product from InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:35:58.751 --> 01:36:01.855]  We are so proud of InfoWarsLife Immune Support.

[01:36:17.933 --> 01:36:19.995]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product.

[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:30.800]  This product is incredible.

[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:39.800]  It is a 360 win.
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:43.800]   The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:46.800]   to boost your body's natural defenses and keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.800]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:52.800]  Take action now. InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:57.400]  All right, Dr. Rainer Fulmich is loaded for bear.
[01:36:57.493 --> 01:37:06.818]  He's coming up here in just a few minutes, but one of my favorite guests, Dr. Vladimir Zevzalenko of ZDTalksLife.com is here, and I wanted him because he's got great products.
[01:37:06.858 --> 01:37:10.761]  He came up with all these different treatments two years ago that saved millions of lives.
[01:37:10.801 --> 01:37:13.382]  He never wants to talk about it, but I approached him.
[01:37:13.402 --> 01:37:14.443]  I said, you should be a sponsor.
[01:37:14.963 --> 01:37:15.903]  We want to promote your products.
[01:37:15.923 --> 01:37:16.523]  He said, fine.
[01:37:17.083 --> 01:37:21.925]  So humor me, because I asked him last segment to do it and he went off on a deal about Abraham, which is powerful.
[01:37:21.945 --> 01:37:22.705]  I loved hearing it.
[01:37:22.965 --> 01:37:29.026]  But spend a few minutes, sir, about the great products you've got that counter all the crazy stuff that's going on in the world.
[01:37:30.666 --> 01:37:45.369]   I see people dropping dead from blood clots and getting immune dysregulation or underreactive immune system and dying from stuff that they shouldn't be dying from like a cold or omicron
[01:37:45.369 --> 01:37:51.079]   and so I saw there was a need to You know that the allows me to say create a nutritional
[01:37:51.079 --> 01:38:00.508]   supplement an immune booster that may help people and so Z detox contains NAC and the seal assisting this stuff
[01:38:00.508 --> 01:38:04.168]   stops blood clots everything I'm saying is peer-reviewed
[01:38:04.168 --> 01:38:11.929]   NIH on the NIH server and so on so NAC stops blood clots and if someone's at risk of blood clots for whatever reason
[01:38:11.929 --> 01:38:13.929]  that's a good thing.
[01:38:14.073 --> 01:38:21.074]  And also, one of the problems I've seen lately, for some unknown reason, is people's immune systems are getting destroyed.
[01:38:21.694 --> 01:38:44.639]   And so, using EGCG, which is a green tea extract, together with a higher dose of zinc, mitigates the risk of getting certain viruses, like new further Future strains of COVID, or influenza virus, or RSV virus, or even, God forbid, Marburg virus, which is a potential emerging bioterrorist threat.
[01:38:45.139 --> 01:38:57.306]  They're all oxygen-strained RNA viruses, so by inhibiting the common pathway for viruses to replicate these viruses, that is a very good thing for people who have a damaged immune system.
[01:38:58.247 --> 01:39:03.170]  I'm trying to detox people from a toxic world, if you can read between the lines.
[01:39:03.806 --> 01:39:05.868]  And so it was born out of need, you know.
[01:39:05.888 --> 01:39:11.032]  I can't stand having people die from blood clots, 20-year-olds dying from blood clots.
[01:39:11.052 --> 01:39:11.653]  What the hell is that?
[01:39:12.273 --> 01:39:16.136]  And so we need to, I have some very good news.
[01:39:16.436 --> 01:39:24.603]  Most people don't know this, but in three years or so, there's technology that's going to come out that's going to completely reboot the innate immune system.
[01:39:24.623 --> 01:39:28.086]  There's a way to restore, basically cure AIDS in a sense.
[01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:38.855]  But that's going to take three years, and to have a bridge to help people get to that point, until that technology is available, I think is a worthy thing to do.
[01:39:41.797 --> 01:39:44.278]  And people can get the great products, and you're a supporter of ours.
[01:39:44.298 --> 01:39:45.039]  They're amazing.
[01:39:45.239 --> 01:39:47.640]  ZDTalksLive.com forward slash Alex.
[01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:48.821]  In closing, Doc...
[01:39:51.118 --> 01:39:53.840]  You came out two years ago and said it's going to cause HIV.
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:57.603]  Dr. Yidan, the former head of Pfizer Science, said that.
[01:39:58.063 --> 01:40:04.507]  We knew that it was the HIV delivery system patented by Gates and others and Moderna in 2016.
[01:40:05.028 --> 01:40:13.033]  The nakedness of this, I mean, it's obviously premeditated, but I'm just shocked that they would like patent it and own it and do it.
[01:40:13.534 --> 01:40:14.755]  And then now it's happening.
[01:40:14.815 --> 01:40:19.379]   I mean, these people have got They got some balls they got to carry around in wheelbarrows, man.
[01:40:19.399 --> 01:40:24.866]  Because let me tell you, I'm not a violent guy and I'm not calling for violence, but you kill people in my family, you're going to pay for it.
[01:40:25.226 --> 01:40:29.031]  And there's a lot of people that are really going to do whatever it takes to stop these people politically.
[01:40:29.051 --> 01:40:31.894]  I mean, I just can't believe, why do they want to kill us?
[01:40:32.575 --> 01:40:33.977]  Why are they starting this fight with us?
[01:40:36.226 --> 01:40:38.789]  Well, you're an impediment to them.
[01:40:38.809 --> 01:40:41.452]  You know, there's two ways to approach life.
[01:40:41.912 --> 01:40:50.862]  I'm going to grow together with you and as a collaboration, and we all prosper, or I'm going to make myself feel better and grow by stepping on your head.
[01:40:51.443 --> 01:40:52.324]  These are narcissists.
[01:40:52.424 --> 01:40:57.850]  These are people that, you know, the whole world is suffering because Bill Gates couldn't find a girlfriend in high school.
[01:40:58.410 --> 01:41:06.055]  Their hatred for humanity is so severe that they literally get sexual gratification by destroying other people.
[01:41:07.216 --> 01:41:07.576]  That's it.
[01:41:07.596 --> 01:41:08.577]  That's the psychology.
[01:41:08.617 --> 01:41:10.198]  Dr. Zelenko, we love you.
[01:41:10.218 --> 01:41:10.878]  We appreciate you.
[01:41:10.938 --> 01:41:12.900]  ZDTalksLive.com.
[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:13.780]  Thank you so much.
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:14.781]  Look forward to talking to you soon.
[01:41:15.761 --> 01:41:16.422]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:41:16.562 --> 01:41:17.082]  God bless Mary.
[01:41:17.543 --> 01:41:18.043]  God bless you.
[01:41:18.243 --> 01:41:19.724]  Powerful, our interview.
[01:41:19.824 --> 01:41:20.324]  Powerful.
[01:41:21.607 --> 01:41:27.491]  I could ask a hundred questions of this guy, but it's just best if I bring him on and talk about what he's done.
[01:41:28.051 --> 01:41:29.132]  He is a lawyer.
[01:41:30.193 --> 01:41:37.477]  He has put on these committee hearings that have been seen by tens of millions of people, dealing with the war crimes that have been committed.
[01:41:37.897 --> 01:41:43.101]  Dr. Reiner Fulmich joins us, and the best way to cover this is just to let him take over.
[01:41:45.123 --> 01:41:47.664]  And tell us in the next 45 minutes what he's about to cover.
[01:41:48.085 --> 01:41:49.485]  Fulmich.com.
[01:41:50.006 --> 01:41:53.388]  F-U-E-L-L-M-I-C-H.com.
[01:41:53.708 --> 01:41:55.389]  CrimesAgainstHumanityTour.com.
[01:41:55.749 --> 01:41:56.329]  He is here.
[01:41:56.729 --> 01:41:59.671]  So, thank you so much, sir, Dr. Rainer Fulmich, for joining us.
[01:42:00.191 --> 01:42:08.736]  Tell us in the next four or five minutes to break what you're about to lay out today, because the enemies of humanity are moving heaven and earth today to try to stop what you're about to say.
[01:42:10.356 --> 01:42:12.338]  Well, thanks for having me back, Alex.
[01:42:13.198 --> 01:42:21.465]  Yes, I can only confirm what Dr. Zelenko, a really good man, just told you.
[01:42:21.685 --> 01:42:24.067]  These people are really trying to kill us.
[01:42:24.727 --> 01:42:29.611]  They are trying to reduce the population, the world's population.
[01:42:30.191 --> 01:42:35.856]  I think what they have in mind is reducing us by 80% or so.
[01:42:35.876 --> 01:42:37.217]  I don't think they're going to succeed.
[01:42:38.347 --> 01:42:43.991]  And we're doing something about this, and that's why we founded the Corona Investigative Committee.
[01:42:44.011 --> 01:42:48.695]  Its website is corona-committee.com.
[01:42:49.796 --> 01:43:09.773]   But on top of this, after we had gotten all these little pieces of the puzzle about how the PCR test doesn't do what people claim, or what Fauci and Drosten from Germany claim it does, How the vaccines are not necessary because we don't have a Corona pandemic.
[01:43:09.954 --> 01:43:12.177]  Rather, we have a PCR test pandemic.
[01:43:12.357 --> 01:43:15.060]  Also, we have alternative methods of treatment.
[01:43:15.381 --> 01:43:20.488]  Dr. Zelenko invented the Zelenko protocol, which works perfectly well.
[01:43:21.383 --> 01:43:24.266]  Plus they're neither effective nor are they safe.
[01:43:24.787 --> 01:43:39.462]  So we took all these pieces of the puzzle and decided with a group of international attorneys to let the people see the entire picture through a judicial proceeding which is based on the American Grand Jury proceeding.
[01:43:39.582 --> 01:43:42.385]  This is a suggestion by our colleague Anna Garner.
[01:43:43.185 --> 01:43:46.149]  And we had this six-day hearing.
[01:43:46.169 --> 01:43:54.517]  We're going to conclude it soon with closing arguments, and then we're going to go into phase two.
[01:43:54.577 --> 01:44:05.749]  We're going to have an actual trial, and we're going to probably be able to enforce the judgment that will hopefully result from this trial.
[01:44:07.050 --> 01:44:08.631]  Why am I saying this?
[01:44:08.711 --> 01:44:17.349]   Well, I think it is taking too many chances to try to bring this case, file it, and Within the system.
[01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:23.652]  There are some places where the system still works, in particular in some places in the US, but also in India.
[01:44:24.052 --> 01:44:29.834]  But most of the places here in Europe, in particular in Germany, are totally corrupted and infiltrated.
[01:44:29.974 --> 01:44:36.337]  So there's no use in getting one of these systems court to hear these cases.
[01:44:36.397 --> 01:44:37.737]  We're not going to get a fair hearing.
[01:44:38.177 --> 01:45:13.055]   So we're going to do this outside of the system, but we still believe, because it's a real trial with real attorneys, a real judge, And a real jury, which will be our viewers, we still believe we can enforce the resulting judgment because it looks, if you look at Ukraine, which is just an extension of the fear mongering that we've seen with the Corona pandemic, if you look at Ukraine, they're using this in order to keep us in fear mode and panic mode in order to go through with their great reset, which
[01:45:15.177 --> 01:45:27.188]  It's real goal is to create a one world government because they want to make us believe there are national governments, which they're not our national, our governments anymore.
[01:45:27.769 --> 01:45:46.950]   Most of them have been infiltrated into our systems through the World Economic Forum, which Has its own production capacity in in terms of their young global leaders program.
[01:45:47.703 --> 01:45:53.027]  So we do believe that things are going to come to a head probably in the fall.
[01:45:53.107 --> 01:46:07.098]  You can't make any precise predictions, but based on the testimony that we got from geopoliticians, based on what we think is really happening in Ukraine, it's very hard to tell because there's propaganda on both sides.
[01:46:07.198 --> 01:46:17.045]  But the one side that we're being presented is the one that is presented to us by the same people who've been lying to us about Corona, the mainstream media.
[01:46:17.245 --> 01:46:17.765]  That's right.
[01:46:17.806 --> 01:46:19.567]  Dr. Reiner Fulmick, stay right there.
[01:46:19.587 --> 01:46:21.488]  We're going to come back and lay this out.
[01:46:21.508 --> 01:46:23.770]  But it's just an incredible time to be alive.
[01:46:24.110 --> 01:46:25.231]  Huge awakenings happening.
[01:46:25.251 --> 01:46:29.174]  They're acting like they're pulling back in the cub of tyranny, but they're waiting in the wings.
[01:46:29.454 --> 01:46:31.536]  So it's so important to continue to hammer this truth.
[01:46:31.776 --> 01:46:32.316]  We'll be right back.
[01:46:32.336 --> 01:46:32.877]  Please stay with us.
[01:46:34.218 --> 01:46:37.580]  Well, you can pull up a State Department CIA document from the late 60s.
[01:46:38.733 --> 01:46:46.972]   under different titles, but it's 198 ways to peacefully resist. Another headline gives you the same CIA plan.
[01:46:46.972 --> 01:46:56.012]   It's 198 ways for civil disobedience. Another one's 198 ways of nonviolent action.
[01:46:56.012 --> 01:47:00.733]   And one of the biggest ones, which they didn't invent this, they're just listing it,
[01:47:00.733 --> 01:47:06.813]   is a mock trial or a grand jury with real scientists, real lawyers, real people.
[01:47:07.074 --> 01:47:09.495]  You put on the evidence as a blueprint for others to do it.
[01:47:10.195 --> 01:47:16.857]  In fact, I've seen political scientists point out that the mock trial or the mock grand jury is one of the most important.
[01:47:16.877 --> 01:47:29.208]   And I saw the enemy disinfo agents go crazy months ago when a very famous, successful, respected attorney, Dr. Reiner Fulman, came out and did this. They said, "Oh, he's claiming it's a
[01:47:29.208 --> 01:47:29.729]  real trial."
[01:47:29.729 --> 01:47:34.529]   Well, no, it's a real presentation of evidence to get a real investigation.
[01:47:34.529 --> 01:47:40.328]   So that you see that deception because they're so scared of something real like this,
[01:47:40.328 --> 01:47:43.569]   where we put these people on trial every day too, showing you all this stuff.
[01:47:44.523 --> 01:47:45.563]  Everything in life is a trial.
[01:47:45.823 --> 01:47:46.584]  You go to a restaurant.
[01:47:46.624 --> 01:47:47.324]  Is the food good?
[01:47:47.544 --> 01:47:48.224]  You buy a suit.
[01:47:48.244 --> 01:47:48.904]  Does it fit well?
[01:47:48.924 --> 01:47:49.484]  Does it last?
[01:47:49.504 --> 01:47:50.205]  You buy a car.
[01:47:50.585 --> 01:47:51.565]  Everything's a trial in life.
[01:47:52.085 --> 01:47:55.906]  So he's really pioneered this, and what matters is he did a great job.
[01:47:55.926 --> 01:48:03.128]  They were very truthful, very accurate, and it got seen conservatively, where I saw it, 20, 30, 40 million times.
[01:48:03.168 --> 01:48:07.729]  So he's here with us until the end of the hour, and he's got so much to say about where we are.
[01:48:08.729 --> 01:48:12.954]  I had to pick two people that have been on the show the last few years who just have a way of saying things.
[01:48:13.054 --> 01:48:15.196]  It's Dr. Zelenko and it's Reiner Fulming.
[01:48:16.117 --> 01:48:18.860]  Just the way they describe things is just so dead on.
[01:48:19.741 --> 01:48:21.783]  I'm not praising you, sir, to get accolade.
[01:48:21.983 --> 01:48:28.650]  I'm just saying I really respect your view on this and where we're going because it seems you're dialed into the zeitgeist.
[01:48:28.690 --> 01:48:30.332]  So just wherever you want to go, please continue.
[01:48:31.758 --> 01:48:32.678]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[01:48:32.718 --> 01:48:34.459]  That's heaping too much praise on me.
[01:48:34.879 --> 01:48:36.240]  We're a group of attorneys.
[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:45.444]  We're about 30 attorneys from all over the world, including South Africa, the United States, Canada, France, Italy, many, many other countries, India.
[01:48:46.164 --> 01:48:52.227]  And it's only the fact that we're all connected and we're all in it for the cause.
[01:48:52.327 --> 01:48:54.748]  No one's in it for money because we're not making any.
[01:48:54.788 --> 01:48:57.689]  That's the power, is this college of people coming together.
[01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:57.809]  Yes.
[01:48:58.635 --> 01:48:59.977]  Yes, it's incredible.
[01:49:00.057 --> 01:49:07.589]  But the way that this connection seems to be working, it's almost like, I don't know, magic?
[01:49:08.049 --> 01:49:09.191]  Maybe you can call it that.
[01:49:10.313 --> 01:49:10.854]  Synergy!
[01:49:12.338 --> 01:49:13.779]  Yeah, that's what it is.
[01:49:13.919 --> 01:49:15.700]  It creates synergies.
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:16.501]  There's so much.
[01:49:16.781 --> 01:49:18.683]  We really like each other.
[01:49:18.723 --> 01:49:20.044]  We get along with each other.
[01:49:20.144 --> 01:49:25.768]  We're all doing the same thing and have been doing this for a long time.
[01:49:26.108 --> 01:49:34.634]  And we don't care how many people try to disparage us or try to even cause us serious problems.
[01:49:34.654 --> 01:49:41.040]   You may have heard that our French colleague Virginie Yes, she was arrested early in the morning.
[01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:43.170]  Yes, I meant to bring that up. Tell people about that.
[01:49:43.170 --> 01:49:45.460]  There's video of this. Tell us about it.
[01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:53.140]   Yeah, she was arrested early in the morning. Her two very young children, unfortunately,
[01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:59.700]   had to witness this. She was held in custody for, I think, three days.
[01:49:59.869 --> 01:50:04.433]  It didn't have anything to do with her participation in the grand jury investigation.
[01:50:05.154 --> 01:50:14.842]  Rather, they claimed that she was being held in custody and questioned because she was advising or representing a terrorist.
[01:50:15.283 --> 01:50:21.809]  Well, turns out the terrorist is just somebody who's asking questions and that's why they framed him as a terrorist.
[01:50:21.849 --> 01:50:22.009]  Wow.
[01:50:23.107 --> 01:50:33.928]  In effect, we don't think that there wasn't any cause for this, but what this really meant to do is send a message to the other attorneys in France.
[01:50:34.602 --> 01:50:36.964]  No, because they can't intimidate her.
[01:50:37.945 --> 01:50:39.166]  A message of fear.
[01:50:39.467 --> 01:50:43.931]  If you don't, if you're not in line with the government, then we're going to go after you.
[01:50:44.351 --> 01:50:52.759]  Something very similar happened in Germany about a year ago when a judge in the city of Weimar simply applied the law.
[01:50:53.038 --> 01:50:59.877]   A mother of two underage children, seven and nine years old, came to him and asked for his help and said,
[01:50:59.877 --> 01:51:04.278]   "My children can't sleep, they have stomach aches, they are crying at night,
[01:51:04.278 --> 01:51:06.198]  they don't want to go to school anymore.
[01:51:06.198 --> 01:51:08.078]  They feel they're being tortured.
[01:51:08.078 --> 01:51:13.917]   This constant PCR testing, the mask mandate, social distancing, they want to play and they can't."
[01:51:13.917 --> 01:51:19.877]   So the judge said, "Well, I'm going to have to get some experts, expert witnesses to help me out on this."
[01:51:19.916 --> 01:51:33.545]  And he got in touch with three renowned professors from renowned universities, one PCR test expert, another one, a child psychologist, and another one, a third person who specializes in masks.
[01:51:34.065 --> 01:51:44.952]   Based on their evidence, on their expert opinions, he decided this is illegal, this is unconstitutional, And ordered the school to stop these practices.
[01:51:45.473 --> 01:51:47.634]  Three weeks, so this is perfectly normal.
[01:51:47.975 --> 01:51:53.138]  Three weeks later, his house, his office, his car were searched.
[01:51:53.599 --> 01:51:59.363]  His phone, his cell phone, and his computer were seized.
[01:51:59.683 --> 01:52:01.665]  Same thing happened to the three experts.
[01:52:02.005 --> 01:52:04.407]  Same thing happened to a friend of the judge.
[01:52:04.847 --> 01:52:06.809]  Simply because she was a friend of his.
[01:52:07.129 --> 01:52:08.751]  Same thing happened to a colleague.
[01:52:09.111 --> 01:52:14.155]  Same thing happened to the lawyer who represented the children.
[01:52:14.656 --> 01:52:20.080]  So this is what you're seeing pretty much everywhere in Europe and apparently in some other places as well.
[01:52:20.441 --> 01:52:28.896]   However, it's not going to do the trick because it's only making people more and more angry and making People ask questions.
[01:52:28.976 --> 01:52:30.437]  We're going to continue with our work.
[01:52:30.717 --> 01:52:32.198]  That's why we're really soon.
[01:52:32.298 --> 01:52:42.264]  We're going to have a strategy meeting tomorrow at our Berlin headquarters and we're probably going to very soon start phase start with phase one.
[01:52:42.844 --> 01:52:46.106]  I'm sorry to phase one was the investigation.
[01:52:46.146 --> 01:52:47.567]  It was a real investigation.
[01:52:47.647 --> 01:52:53.270]  It was simply held outside the system, but there's going to be a phase true and that's going to be a real trial.
[01:52:53.690 --> 01:53:02.080]  And as I said earlier, we believe that towards the fall, things are going to come to a head.
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:04.303]  There may even be outright war.
[01:53:04.884 --> 01:53:09.710]  We hope we can still avoid it, but I'm not very optimistic about this.
[01:53:10.110 --> 01:53:20.296]   So after that, After that collapse, or crash, or maybe it's going to be World War III, we don't know, but things are looking really, really bad right now.
[01:53:20.756 --> 01:53:35.923]  After that, however, we're going to be able to enforce any judgment, because after that, it's going to be the 20% of the people, maybe 30% of the people, who have always been in the resistance, who will, most of them, we believe, will survive.
[01:53:36.323 --> 01:53:38.144]  So, I'm not trying to be...
[01:53:39.444 --> 01:53:39.904]  You're right.
[01:53:39.964 --> 01:53:41.525]  We're in a war with globalists.
[01:53:41.585 --> 01:53:42.506]  This is a total war.
[01:53:42.926 --> 01:53:51.971]  And what's incredible is I see Fauci and I see the head of Pfizer and others now backtracking and saying, oh, we were just told to do this.
[01:53:52.451 --> 01:53:55.072]  So I see a lot of signs that they admit they're in deep trouble.
[01:53:55.453 --> 01:53:58.874]  Plus the fact that they're hardly seen in public now.
[01:53:59.155 --> 01:54:03.377]  Why did they suddenly back off just a few months ago when they were pushing?
[01:54:03.417 --> 01:54:05.238]  Because they saw so much resistance?
[01:54:06.934 --> 01:54:07.535]  I think so.
[01:54:07.875 --> 01:54:20.164]  I do think this is part of their game plan, however, because they must have expected that quite a few of us will not back down and more and more people are waking up.
[01:54:20.464 --> 01:54:26.869]  That's why they're looking, and they had this as part of their game plan, we believe, right from the start.
[01:54:27.129 --> 01:54:32.714]  That's why they're moving into their second phase, which is Ukraine, the war in Ukraine.
[01:54:33.234 --> 01:54:33.795]  Well, that's right.
[01:54:33.835 --> 01:54:36.276]  Stay there, but show how astute you are, because most people don't know this.
[01:54:36.697 --> 01:54:41.040]  It's in their different battle plans, like the SPARS document, that they know will push back.
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:44.843]  They'll give up for a little bit, and then hammer down next with what?
[01:54:44.883 --> 01:54:45.784]  Hemorrhagic fever?
[01:54:45.824 --> 01:54:46.504]  God knows what.
[01:54:46.965 --> 01:54:48.666]  Dr. Reiner Fulmich is with us.
[01:54:48.686 --> 01:54:50.207]  You should definitely visit his site.
[01:54:52.389 --> 01:54:54.751]  He gave a new site out that everybody should visit on screen.
[01:54:54.771 --> 01:54:55.632]  We'll put that on screen.
[01:54:56.012 --> 01:54:56.893]  Fulmich.com.
[01:54:56.933 --> 01:54:58.434]  CrimesAgainstHumanityTour.com.
[01:54:59.767 --> 01:55:00.147]  And more.
[01:55:00.187 --> 01:55:01.248]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:01.688 --> 01:55:03.489]  History is happening right now.
[01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:14.473]  So, Dr. Reiner Foldman, one of the top lawyers out there, exposing this incredible power grab, this Nuremberg violating code, this insanity.
[01:55:15.153 --> 01:55:15.853]  Please continue.
[01:55:15.873 --> 01:55:18.875]  I could ask a lot of questions, but you're really educated on this.
[01:55:19.395 --> 01:55:20.935]  What do you expect to come next?
[01:55:20.995 --> 01:55:21.956]  What can we do?
[01:55:22.036 --> 01:55:22.836]  What's unfolding?
[01:55:23.196 --> 01:55:24.697]  Why have they backed off a little bit?
[01:55:24.757 --> 01:55:25.737]  Is that a sign of weakness?
[01:55:26.158 --> 01:55:26.978]  What do you expect next?
[01:55:28.453 --> 01:55:30.075]  No, I completely agree with you.
[01:55:30.555 --> 01:55:32.938]  This is not a sign of weakness.
[01:55:33.018 --> 01:55:39.564]  They're just letting go of the reins for a short while and then they're going to pull back hard again.
[01:55:39.584 --> 01:55:46.972]  This is part of their deliberate attempt to confuse, disorient, distract us.
[01:55:47.952 --> 01:55:54.452]   It's meant to make people so disoriented that ultimately they're going to agree to anything
[01:55:54.452 --> 01:55:59.271]   that they tell us, they being the people who are pulling the strings of the Anglo-American
[01:55:59.271 --> 01:56:05.431]   financial mafia, which is based in the City of London, not London, but the City of London
[01:56:05.431 --> 01:56:09.592]  and its fifth column in the US, that's Wall Street.
[01:56:09.592 --> 01:56:15.231]   We see some of the people who are pulling the strings, including maybe Bill Gates, but
[01:56:15.231 --> 01:56:19.351]   maybe somebody else is pulling his strings, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds.
[01:56:19.351 --> 01:56:27.952]   These people own 146 central banks, including the Fed, including the German Bundesbank,
[01:56:27.952 --> 01:56:31.351]   including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
[01:56:31.351 --> 01:56:34.391]  But I have to correct a mistake I made.
[01:56:34.391 --> 01:56:39.792]   The actual website on which you can see all the interviews we did with people like Dr.
[01:56:39.792 --> 01:56:50.792]   Mike Yidden, a former vice president of Pfizer, Dr. – or rather, Professor Luc Montagnier.
[01:56:50.792 --> 01:56:55.152]   By the way, Luc Montagnier is a Nobel Prize winner from France.
[01:56:55.163 --> 01:56:55.963]  Yeah, that's correct.
[01:56:56.083 --> 01:56:59.407]  It's Corona-Investigative-Committee.com.
[01:56:59.226 --> 01:57:08.466]   Get back to him, but here it is, corona-investigative-committee.com, that's the URL to check.
[01:57:08.466 --> 01:57:13.947]  Please get back to the discoverer of HIV and what he said.
[01:57:13.971 --> 01:57:32.974]   And so he discovered HIV and months ago when we interviewed him, shortly before he died, he said, well, if you test positive and you have to be hospitalized after you got vaccinated, That means you probably have AIDS.
[01:57:33.114 --> 01:57:36.676]  Go see your doctor, go to a hospital, have them check for AIDS.
[01:57:36.996 --> 01:57:38.997]  And it turns out he's right.
[01:57:39.438 --> 01:57:46.602]  That's what one of the professors, a biologist from the University of Brooksburg, told us, Professor Ulrika Kemmerer.
[01:57:46.882 --> 01:57:51.664]   She said, it looks like these shots which are of course not vaccines,
[01:57:51.664 --> 01:57:56.783]   they're just experimental gene therapies or maybe not even therapies.
[01:57:56.783 --> 01:58:01.963]   What they're really doing is they're shutting off your immune system and that's why many people call this
[01:58:01.963 --> 01:58:09.403]   what it causes now, call this VI AIDS, vaccine-induced autoimmune deficiency syndrome.
[01:58:09.403 --> 01:58:10.463]  That's what happens.
[01:58:10.491 --> 01:58:12.554]  Plus the blood clotting that you mentioned.
[01:58:12.995 --> 01:58:15.118]  How did they think they'd get away with this?
[01:58:15.178 --> 01:58:19.965]  I guess start a war, start a financial collapse during it to make us forget about what they just did.
[01:58:20.005 --> 01:58:22.169]  But yes, VAIDS is now happening.
[01:58:23.567 --> 01:58:24.968]  That is exactly the point.
[01:58:25.909 --> 01:58:29.412]  They're going to start or they are in the process of starting a war.
[01:58:29.452 --> 01:58:36.658]  What we see in Ukraine, again, there's propaganda on both sides, but there is another side to this coin.
[01:58:36.698 --> 01:58:46.747]  What we see in Ukraine, as you probably know and your viewers know, is the NATO and the Anglo-American financial mafia are pushing for a war.
[01:58:47.207 --> 01:58:51.848]   They led uh... ukraine the ukraine people to believe
[01:58:51.848 --> 01:58:57.208]   that if they uh... on attacked russia or take back
[01:58:57.208 --> 01:59:03.687]   uh... the car cramier of by force they would get support from nato of course they did
[01:59:03.687 --> 01:59:06.802]   uh... and but they're trying to know exactly They stirred them up.
[01:59:06.902 --> 01:59:16.328]  Lindsey Graham, Klaus Schwab, of course, George Soros, all of them said, go ahead and invade, go ahead and attack.
[01:59:16.789 --> 01:59:20.932]  And then when they did it and attacked the Russian held areas, that elicited the response.
[01:59:20.972 --> 01:59:27.836]  So clearly, the globalists wanted to bring Russia into this as the political distraction for the economic collapse that's now happening.
[01:59:27.856 --> 01:59:28.837]  They're blaming Russia.
[01:59:29.117 --> 01:59:33.600]  Whether you love Russia or hate them, Russia did not cause the hyperinflation that's currently happening.
[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:38.141]  Yeah, they're making pretty good progress with their warmongering.
[01:59:38.522 --> 01:59:43.123]  They even got the Swiss to forget their neutrality.
[01:59:43.143 --> 01:59:47.744]  They're now also supplying Ukraine with all kinds of weapons.
[01:59:48.165 --> 01:59:49.065]  Germany is.
[01:59:49.085 --> 01:59:55.667]  I think some of the countries that didn't want to join NATO are now about to join NATO, Finland including.
[01:59:56.307 --> 02:00:04.453]  So things are going, seem to be going according to plan, but part of what we're seeing is sheer desperation on the other side.
[02:00:04.473 --> 02:00:08.636]  Of course they're making progress because they've had so much time to plan for this.
[02:00:09.036 --> 02:00:13.839]  Probably 30 years or make concrete plans for this for the last 10 years or so.
[02:00:13.859 --> 02:00:16.001]  But they need the collapse to be without getting in blame.
[02:00:16.281 --> 02:00:20.744]  So they're having success in the collapse, but not in success in covering up their running it.
[02:00:22.094 --> 02:00:22.555]  Exactly.
[02:00:22.615 --> 02:00:23.816]  We're on to them.
[02:00:24.597 --> 02:00:36.291]  In fact, the latest thing we found out about Klaus Schwab, whom you just mentioned, the head of their most important platform, this is where they meet in Davos, this is where they meet once a year.
[02:00:36.751 --> 02:00:41.958]  Klaus Schwab and his World Economic Forum, everybody thought it's a European invention.
[02:00:42.438 --> 02:00:45.399]  They founded it in Europe because Klaus Schwab is so smart.
[02:00:45.439 --> 02:00:46.299]  No, not so.
[02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:54.403]  One of the experts who we interviewed last Friday is an investigative journalist by the name of Johnny Vetmore.
[02:00:54.483 --> 02:00:59.064]  He's the partner of Whitney Webb, another investigative journalist.
[02:00:59.364 --> 02:01:01.665]  He dug deeply into his family history.
[02:01:01.745 --> 02:01:09.048]  Turns out his father, Klaus Schwab's father, tried to help out the Nazis, tried to help them build an atomic bomb.
[02:01:09.548 --> 02:01:11.549]  And Klaus Schwab tried the very same.
[02:01:12.029 --> 02:01:16.892]  In the 1960s while setting or founding the World Economic Forum.
[02:01:16.912 --> 02:01:18.533]  Oh yeah, he's like Dr. Evil.
[02:01:18.553 --> 02:01:20.574]  The reason he looks like Dr. Evil is he is.
[02:01:21.074 --> 02:01:22.295]  He's literally a supervillain.
[02:01:23.686 --> 02:01:35.254]  He is, and he tried to help the South African apartheid regime build up their own nuclear power, give them the power to make nuclear bombs.
[02:01:35.634 --> 02:01:40.877]  This is against international law, this is illegal, this guy is a monster.
[02:01:40.897 --> 02:01:42.138]  He's obsessed with power.
[02:01:43.294 --> 02:01:44.354]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:01:44.595 --> 02:01:50.857]  But it turns out, this is not a European, the World Economic Forum is not a European creation.
[02:01:50.917 --> 02:02:00.380]  Klaus Schwab went to Harvard in the 1960s and there was, they had a program there which was financed by the CIA, run by Henry Kissinger.
[02:02:00.441 --> 02:02:09.284]  That's right, he's got the special, I know the people involved, they whistleblowed, Dr. Francis Boyle, he got the special one person a year CIA global government PhD.
[02:02:10.697 --> 02:02:12.138]  Yes, that's what he got.
[02:02:12.678 --> 02:02:19.443]  So it was basically a CIA-financed invention by Henry Kissinger.
[02:02:20.003 --> 02:02:25.547]  Another thing that could be important, I don't know if you've spoken to this guy, Todd Callender.
[02:02:25.747 --> 02:02:26.848]  He's a U.S.
[02:02:26.908 --> 02:02:33.752]  attorney, specializes in insurance law, and he represents thousands and thousands of members of the military.
[02:02:34.453 --> 02:02:47.511]   And he tells us that in 2021, Only during the first 10 months of 2021, the military saw a 1,100% increase in deaths after vaccination.
[02:02:47.771 --> 02:02:51.912]  Now, this is not old people who had prior medical conditions.
[02:02:51.972 --> 02:03:02.337]  This is young, healthy, fit people between the ages of 18 and 30, maybe, who didn't wake up, who just stayed in bed and never woke up dead.
[02:03:02.657 --> 02:03:12.657]   For 2022, he says, we expect an increase in all-cause mortality in the military of 5,000%.
[02:03:12.657 --> 02:03:15.657]  Now, if this is not genocide, what is?
[02:03:15.657 --> 02:03:19.657]  You're able to really break this down, Dr. Fulming.
[02:03:19.981 --> 02:03:20.781]  What's the endgame?
[02:03:20.821 --> 02:03:23.122]  We know it's depopulation, but why are they doing it now?
[02:03:23.262 --> 02:03:26.343]  It's so risky, in my view, even for the establishment.
[02:03:26.383 --> 02:03:27.063]  This is crazy.
[02:03:28.482 --> 02:03:32.605]  Well, it may very well be that they were pushed into an early start.
[02:03:33.025 --> 02:03:41.510]  You know, 11 or 12 years ago, when we had the housing crisis, the Lehman crisis, we should have been much more careful.
[02:03:41.789 --> 02:03:47.469]   I, as a former banker, I used to work for one of the most criminal organizations within
[02:03:47.469 --> 02:03:51.229]   the banking industry, the banking mafia rather, Deutsche Bank.
[02:03:51.229 --> 02:03:53.309]  I should have seen what's going on.
[02:03:53.309 --> 02:03:55.350]  I should have seen this as blatant fraud.
[02:03:55.350 --> 02:04:00.828]   I have a really good friend who, you know, I spent three weeks in India recharging my
[02:04:00.828 --> 02:04:01.828]  batteries.
[02:04:01.828 --> 02:04:06.189]   I met a really good friend there who also used to work for Deutsche Bank, a former investment
[02:04:06.189 --> 02:04:07.189]  banker.
[02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:10.149]   He's afraid that we're going to have World War III in the fall and it's going to play
[02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:12.750]  out that the battlefield will be Europe.
[02:04:12.750 --> 02:04:14.350]  So he is staying in India.
[02:04:14.350 --> 02:04:15.908]  Stay there, Dr. Reimer Fulman.
[02:04:15.908 --> 02:04:16.908]  Exactly.
[02:04:16.908 --> 02:04:18.989]   I think what you're getting at, I'm not trying to steal your thunder, just to show we're
[02:04:18.989 --> 02:04:20.509]  not making this up.
[02:04:20.509 --> 02:04:21.509]  There's too many old people.
[02:04:21.509 --> 02:04:22.509]  They've got a bubble.
[02:04:22.509 --> 02:04:25.310]   They just want to kill a bunch of people instead of them going to jail.
[02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:26.310]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:26.310 --> 02:04:28.029]  We'll talk about why they're doing this, why BlackRock.
[02:04:28.029 --> 02:04:30.469]  There's a deal that says we need to stop this together.
[02:04:30.443 --> 02:04:31.244]  We're gonna stop it.
[02:04:31.604 --> 02:04:31.965]  Stay with us.
[02:04:34.713 --> 02:04:42.500]  1776coin.com, a great collectible Tree of Liberty coin that funds our operation, and at current sales rate, it'll be sold out by Monday or Tuesday next week.
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:47.444]  I want to encourage everybody to get this historic coin, and it's a founding member coin, meaning we stay on the air during all this.
[02:04:48.045 --> 02:04:53.849]  Soon, everybody that's a member, if you sign up with your email, we'll be getting a lot of really special content and things.
[02:04:54.370 --> 02:04:55.111]  Everybody should get it.
[02:04:56.812 --> 02:04:57.533]  1776coin.com.
[02:04:58.054 --> 02:05:01.357]  All right, Dr. Reiner Fulmich, I'm very impressed.
[02:05:01.517 --> 02:05:02.979]  I've known about you for a long time.
[02:05:03.460 --> 02:05:20.996]   You've been fighting tyranny, but seeing what you're doing now, and we were hitting the break about the wars they're planning, the crises they're engineering, their Economic system coming to an end, the fact that they're all going to go to jail because of derivatives if they don't quote kill the old people.
[02:05:21.036 --> 02:05:30.383]  So you've got all the boomers, so many of them signed on to this leftist agenda, and then this whole new deal, this whole global carbon tax, this whole build back better.
[02:05:31.024 --> 02:05:41.171]  But at the heart of it, the globalists admit it's about not giving 65 and up healthcare or their pensions, and I guess giving them vaccines they know statistically aren't vaccines that are going to kill them.
[02:05:41.231 --> 02:05:46.587]   So this is Instead of Bernie Madoff going to jail, these bankers end up taking over the world.
[02:05:47.007 --> 02:05:51.531]  It seems like pretty simple to beat if we admit we're being attacked by something this evil.
[02:05:51.932 --> 02:05:59.778]  The problem is there's that learned helplessness or that mass Stockholm syndrome where people just don't want to admit what's really happening to them, which is too frightening.
[02:05:59.818 --> 02:06:03.762]  But not admitting it lets it happen, which is actually frightening.
[02:06:05.819 --> 02:06:06.859]  That's exactly true.
[02:06:06.919 --> 02:06:08.940]  We do have to see the full picture.
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:17.201]  We have to see what's really going on, no matter how frightening it is, because if we don't, we're not going to do the right thing.
[02:06:17.381 --> 02:06:18.582]  And it's right.
[02:06:18.602 --> 02:06:22.642]  This is basically a financial catastrophe that we're facing.
[02:06:23.102 --> 02:06:28.423]  Our currencies are probably going to be completely devalued very soon.
[02:06:28.484 --> 02:06:30.684]  The dollar has reached the end of the line.
[02:06:31.905 --> 02:06:42.012]  And it turns out that maybe their own wrongdoing pushed them into an early start.
[02:06:42.172 --> 02:06:51.219]  Because, you know, as I said earlier, we should have known that the financial industry is really a financial mafia when we saw what happened.
[02:06:52.219 --> 02:07:10.089]  After the financial crisis of the Lehman, the housing crisis, which turned into a world economic crisis, because nothing happened, despite the fact that the politicians said, we're going to stop this once and for all, we're going to hold everyone responsible, everyone accountable, who is accountable, nothing happened, except that they printed money.
[02:07:10.509 --> 02:07:18.933]  They looted and plundered our public coffers over decades, probably much longer than that, but we can see this precisely over decades.
[02:07:19.274 --> 02:07:44.474]   And then, In September of 2019, when the central bankers met in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which they do once a year, BlackRock seems to have panicked, because we are in possession of a summary that they did for this meeting, and they basically said, not using these very same words that I'm using, man, they're on to us.
[02:07:44.514 --> 02:07:45.535]  They know what's going on.
[02:07:45.555 --> 02:07:47.517]  We have to do something drastic.
[02:07:47.957 --> 02:07:49.919]  In order to distract their attention.
[02:07:50.259 --> 02:07:53.201]  And that is why I think they had an early start.
[02:07:53.521 --> 02:08:00.766]  They pushed Drustin to invent these two falsehoods, these two fraudulent assertions.
[02:08:01.007 --> 02:08:03.388]  One, there are asymptomatic infections.
[02:08:03.448 --> 02:08:04.229]  Of course, they're not.
[02:08:04.269 --> 02:08:05.210]  There's no such thing.
[02:08:05.290 --> 02:08:09.373]  Asymptomatically infected people are healthy people.
[02:08:09.693 --> 02:08:21.758]   And two, I Drosten have invented a PCR test that can tell you who really is infected when in fact a PCR test can do no such thing and this guy knew it.
[02:08:21.798 --> 02:08:23.679]  He's lying and we can show it in a court of law.
[02:08:23.759 --> 02:08:27.240]  Unfortunately, the World Health Organization published this.
[02:08:27.660 --> 02:08:39.951]  And recommended this PCR testing, so that is the basis, that's the foundation for everything, and that's why we and all of my lawsuits and all of my colleagues' lawsuits have decided to attack at this foundation.
[02:08:40.191 --> 02:08:54.103]  Because if there's no cases, because the PCR test cannot tell you anything about infections, then there's no basis, no factual and no legal basis for any of the measures, let alone for the so-called vaccinations.
[02:08:54.543 --> 02:09:08.728]  So it was BlackRock that led us to believe, and I think this is a correct assumption, that they were pushed into an early start, and that gives us an advantage over them, because they're in a hurry.
[02:09:09.108 --> 02:09:23.776]   They are the ones who are really panicking, because they know if they don't succeed in distracting us from what they have done, If they don't succeed in keeping us from waking up, we're going to hold them responsible.
[02:09:23.896 --> 02:09:29.961]  This time, we're not going to let the politicians do it, but we're going to do it ourselves because we have to do it ourselves.
[02:09:30.281 --> 02:09:32.603]  There is no cavalry that's going to come to our aid.
[02:09:32.623 --> 02:09:33.824]  There's no foreign...
[02:09:34.184 --> 02:09:40.384]   Power that's going to come to our aid no allies that they were going to free Germany or any other country worry
[02:09:40.384 --> 02:09:47.514]   We the people have to rise up and do it because if we don't Things are going to get a lot worse and this is going to be
[02:09:47.514 --> 02:09:52.063]   the end of humanity because that's what this is about these people are site
[02:09:52.063 --> 02:09:58.144]   They are a sociopath and psychopath and they do in fact want to gain control
[02:09:58.784 --> 02:10:04.543]   Over all of us by creating this one world government and one world digital currency
[02:10:05.013 --> 02:10:09.316]  If we don't do anything, we can see what's going to happen in Australia.
[02:10:09.516 --> 02:10:27.772]   One of the people who we talked to last Friday, a German who's been living there for 25 years, He told us that in the meantime, while they're not having, they seemingly have no restrictions, this is just the calm before the storm, as you said, and that's what he said too.
[02:10:28.153 --> 02:10:31.756]  But this leads people in Australia to not do anything.
[02:10:31.796 --> 02:10:35.360]  There are no demonstrations anymore because there are no restrictions.
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:38.443]  However, they have all these quarantine centers.
[02:10:38.743 --> 02:10:59.582]  which he says look like concentration camps.
[02:10:59.839 --> 02:11:15.805]  They're re-education camps and what we are afraid is going to happen that come fall they're going to really use this not to quarantine people who test positive or who are not vaccinated, well those two, but people who are in the resistance.
[02:11:15.865 --> 02:11:17.066]  That's what he's afraid of.
[02:11:17.526 --> 02:11:25.048]  And on top of this, he says, he and some other investigative journalist took a deep dive into the government, and he says, it's like a pyramid.
[02:11:25.488 --> 02:11:29.729]  What he used to think is that only at the top did they infiltrate their people.
[02:11:29.789 --> 02:11:30.749]  But no, not at all.
[02:11:30.769 --> 02:11:32.069]  That's what I found out.
[02:11:32.309 --> 02:11:32.749]  Exactly.
[02:11:32.769 --> 02:11:34.290]  20 years ago it was the top.
[02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:35.810]  Now they've infiltrated right to the bottom.
[02:11:36.970 --> 02:11:37.470]  Exactly.
[02:11:37.650 --> 02:11:39.551]  That's how they work.
[02:11:39.851 --> 02:11:41.351]  I didn't mean to steal your thunder.
[02:11:41.371 --> 02:11:44.992]  So what do you think we should do when faced with something that monstrous?
[02:11:46.536 --> 02:11:48.459]  Well, basically two things.
[02:11:48.799 --> 02:11:51.043]  Don't panic, because that's what they want us to do.
[02:11:52.124 --> 02:11:53.286]  That's what this is all about.
[02:11:53.366 --> 02:11:54.288]  Disorient us.
[02:11:55.229 --> 02:11:56.391]  Put us into panic mode.
[02:11:56.431 --> 02:11:57.533]  So don't panic.
[02:11:57.893 --> 02:12:10.402]   And simply, the best thing to do, this is what the psychologist told us, is Turn off the mainstream media, don't listen to our politicians because they're not our politicians, and get the truth out.
[02:12:10.942 --> 02:12:16.284]  Look at, for example, look at what you're doing, look at what many others are doing.
[02:12:16.304 --> 02:12:20.165]  Find the truth, do the real, and then magnify it, and don't feel like a victim.
[02:12:20.225 --> 02:12:20.965]  Go on the offense.
[02:12:22.558 --> 02:12:24.899]  Exactly, because we're not the victims.
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:32.743]  We're the ones who can turn this thing around because us, the 20% who are in the resistance, are not the ones who simply follow orders.
[02:12:33.024 --> 02:12:35.025]  We're the ones who are creative.
[02:12:35.085 --> 02:12:37.346]  We ask questions and we're creative.
[02:12:37.686 --> 02:12:45.710]  We are the ones, probably the only ones, our 20%, maybe it's a little more in the not so, as they say, not so developed countries.
[02:12:46.110 --> 02:12:48.752]  But as you say, I don't want to interrupt you, but it's well known this.
[02:12:49.592 --> 02:12:58.036]  5% in a freer economy, maybe 20% in a third world country, but if you've got 5% in a resistance movement, whether it's bad or good, it's going to win if you don't give up.
[02:12:58.056 --> 02:12:58.836]  I agree with you.
[02:12:58.856 --> 02:13:01.817]  I think we're 20% and growing each week and month.
[02:13:01.837 --> 02:13:07.860]  That's why the system is so panicked because people want freedom and we are promoting it and so we're very close.
[02:13:09.335 --> 02:13:12.556]  And you know, we shouldn't fight the system.
[02:13:12.616 --> 02:13:14.677]  It's collapsing anyhow.
[02:13:14.777 --> 02:13:22.560]  We should simply set up a parallel system of justice, of economics, of health care, and of education.
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:23.300]  We can do it.
[02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:25.281]  No, I totally agree.
[02:13:25.361 --> 02:13:26.741]  Fighting it only gives them power.
[02:13:27.521 --> 02:13:28.242]  It's going down.
[02:13:28.262 --> 02:13:29.262]  We want to be away from it.
[02:13:31.420 --> 02:13:32.781]  And it's only a matter of time.
[02:13:33.101 --> 02:13:35.662]  This whole thing is collapsing right now.
[02:13:36.602 --> 02:13:51.107]  We shouldn't just sit there and not do anything, but as you said, we should continue to get out the truth, disseminate this information so that as many people as possible understand what's going on, including those 40% who are still sitting on the fence.
[02:13:51.487 --> 02:14:01.611]   Many of them are beginning to ask questions, even those who got vaccinated, because They don't think it makes any sense that they need another and another and another shot.
[02:14:01.931 --> 02:14:08.714]  And in the meantime, Moderna got an EUA approval for their AIDS vaccine.
[02:14:09.255 --> 02:14:10.335]  What is this all about?
[02:14:10.355 --> 02:14:12.636]  I know you gotta go.
[02:14:12.656 --> 02:14:14.577]  Two minute break, five minutes.
[02:14:15.257 --> 02:14:28.740]  Uh, Dr. Fulmick, we gotta get into the HIV virus, HIV vaccine, this whole thing with Fauci obsessed with HIV, and then now they've released a virus that has part of HIV in it, and now it's in the news, they want us to have this HIV vaccine.
[02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:30.981]  What is the binary function of this?
[02:14:31.001 --> 02:14:37.823]   Because we get, they want us to have this, it's bad enough, but what do they add Your best thinking on that, we'll come back in two minutes.
[02:14:38.123 --> 02:14:43.004]  Folks, you've got to visit the website, corona-investigative-committee.com.
[02:14:43.404 --> 02:14:48.706]  The enemy is working around the clock to make sure this information doesn't get out.
[02:14:48.726 --> 02:14:53.047]  Then I'm going to finish some final news, and Kate Daly's going to take over in the fourth hour.
[02:14:53.167 --> 02:14:54.928]  And meanwhile, they have U.S.
[02:14:54.988 --> 02:14:56.968]  courts issuing arrest warrants for me right now.
[02:14:57.288 --> 02:14:58.108]  I just got that news.
[02:14:58.409 --> 02:14:58.989]  We'll be right back.
[02:14:59.009 --> 02:14:59.429]  Stay with us.
[02:15:00.849 --> 02:15:02.790]  Humanity is at the crossroads.
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:13.679]  And I remember Dr. Yidan and Dr. Zelenko and others two years ago warning, hey, this has the HIV insertion, we know Indian.
[02:15:14.710 --> 02:15:17.133]  University scanned it and found that back in February of 2020.
[02:15:18.394 --> 02:15:26.423]  And now here we are with these huge autoimmune responses, mass tests in Israel, the more they take the shots and they just keep pushing it and pushing.
[02:15:26.503 --> 02:15:34.812]  So we've got Dr. Rainer Fulmich, who is a well-known former banker and also lawyer, who's been heading up really the tip of the spear exposing all this.
[02:15:35.432 --> 02:15:37.552]  I'm trying to figure it out.
[02:15:37.552 --> 02:15:38.712]  There's obviously something there.
[02:15:38.712 --> 02:15:42.152]   There's a spike protein that's patented by Bill Gates and others.
[02:15:42.152 --> 02:15:44.192]  It's HIV with Moderna.
[02:15:44.192 --> 02:15:48.552]  But what's this AIDS connection?
[02:15:48.552 --> 02:15:57.432]   I don't know if really the HIV virus was inserted in this virus.
[02:15:57.486 --> 02:16:13.954]   We know that there have been all kinds of experiments, gain-of-function experiments, which seem to have What they wanted to do is make the virus more dangerous, make it jump from animals to humans, make it more dangerous, basically.
[02:16:14.214 --> 02:16:27.801]  What I do know, after having listened and interviewed to so many experts, is that this is a vaccine-induced autoimmune deficiency syndrome.
[02:16:29.294 --> 02:16:31.195]  We don't know how this is happening.
[02:16:31.255 --> 02:16:39.616]  We've had a number of pathology conferences on which and there are now 50 pathologists cooperating here.
[02:16:39.876 --> 02:16:57.482]   They looked, they performed post-mortems on dozens of people and they came to the conclusion that about 70% of those who died after getting the shots Definitely died because of the shots so that there is causation there in another 20%.
[02:16:57.563 --> 02:17:03.587]  There's a high probability that that is the case and there's only two cases in which they came to the conclusion.
[02:17:03.847 --> 02:17:06.229]  It wasn't caused by the vaccines.
[02:17:06.649 --> 02:17:10.332]  However, these vaccines as you pointed out rightly.
[02:17:11.632 --> 02:17:19.114]  They're experimental, not even gene therapies as one of the professors from France told us, but gene experiments.
[02:17:19.634 --> 02:17:26.595]  You can use mRNA technique for gene therapy.
[02:17:26.935 --> 02:17:30.756]  That's a recognized way of using mRNA techniques.
[02:17:35.171 --> 02:17:39.094]  Through this, you replace a defective gene with another one.
[02:17:39.274 --> 02:17:40.755]  That is not what's happening here.
[02:17:41.596 --> 02:17:54.185]   They're experimenting and we don't know what they're using because even though some of our experts have looked into the vials to see what's in there, We don't, we still don't know what is really in there because you know why?
[02:17:54.586 --> 02:18:11.661]  Because no one, none of the authorities, none of the public authorities which have been taken over by all these private institutions, you probably know that the FDA is funded at least at to 50 or 60 percent by the pharmaceutical industry, so none of them really check this.
[02:18:11.901 --> 02:18:17.650]  They're supposed to do this because they're working in our, the public's best interest, but they're not.
[02:18:17.911 --> 02:18:20.755]  They simply trust the makers of these vaccines.
[02:18:21.216 --> 02:18:22.738]  So that's what this is all about.
[02:18:22.778 --> 02:18:26.284]  We got a bunch of mad scientists with the keys to everything going crazy.
[02:18:27.816 --> 02:18:28.056]  Yes.
[02:18:28.536 --> 02:18:32.418]  They just do whatever they want to do because this is a free-for-all.
[02:18:32.838 --> 02:18:35.940]  No one is checking on anything in no country.
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:40.882]  With the exception maybe of some of the African countries and maybe India as well.
[02:18:41.302 --> 02:18:46.245]  And it is probably no coincidence that in India the judiciary still works pretty well.
[02:18:46.785 --> 02:18:54.488]  The highest court in a final decision in India decided that vaccine mandates are illegal.
[02:18:55.069 --> 02:18:57.439]   So, We have to fight this.
[02:18:57.479 --> 02:19:02.762]  We have to continue to fight this, but without any violence, because that's what they want.
[02:19:03.022 --> 02:19:11.707]  If they get the violence, violence on the streets, that is then their excuse to bring in their own forces, and we don't want that to happen.
[02:19:11.727 --> 02:19:12.048]  That's right.
[02:19:12.068 --> 02:19:14.129]  We don't want them to push us into open conflict.
[02:19:14.149 --> 02:19:22.515]   We want to intellectually, culturally, and economically Direct our support and our will in areas that are peaceful and build a new system.
[02:19:22.795 --> 02:19:24.457]  Dr. Reimer Fulmick, thank you so much.
[02:19:24.577 --> 02:19:25.398]  Amazing work.
[02:19:25.758 --> 02:19:35.506]  People can find all the great things you're doing at corona-investigative-committee.com, or they can find you anywhere, just drreimerfulmick.com.
[02:19:35.566 --> 02:19:36.447]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:19:36.487 --> 02:19:37.388]  We really appreciate you.
[02:19:38.749 --> 02:19:39.449]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:19:40.249 --> 02:19:40.690]  Amazing.
[02:19:40.850 --> 02:19:41.990]  Wow, that was powerful.
[02:19:42.030 --> 02:19:45.431]  Today has been an incredible show with Dr. Zelenko and Dr. Fulming.
[02:19:45.911 --> 02:19:48.272]  I'm going to come back, hit some final news, and hand the baton.
[02:19:48.292 --> 02:19:48.652]  Stay with us.
[02:19:49.932 --> 02:19:59.515]  I know that you're tuned in here because you love justice and you love freedom and you're trying to find out how to survive and how to make your family thrive.
[02:19:59.615 --> 02:20:00.576]  I'm in the same boat.
[02:20:01.436 --> 02:20:04.077]  I'm not here giving out all the knowledge like I've got all the answers.
[02:20:04.117 --> 02:20:07.658]  We're coming to these conclusions collectively together.
[02:20:09.275 --> 02:20:19.981]  But I got to tell you, just realizing the globalists are out to get us and beginning the thought processes of what they're up to is victory.
[02:20:20.862 --> 02:20:27.145]  They don't even want to be identified as the new world order, much less how we try to figure out how to beat them.
[02:20:28.426 --> 02:20:30.627]  They're doing all of this because they're desperate.
[02:20:31.228 --> 02:20:32.068]  They know they're losing.
[02:20:33.709 --> 02:20:34.950]  But I can tell you something right now.
[02:20:38.024 --> 02:20:43.285]  Infowars has been through a long 28-year history of serious intense learning.
[02:20:44.485 --> 02:20:52.387]  As we fought the globalists and as we learned more and as we went through different attacks and different tribulations, we got stronger and stronger.
[02:20:52.527 --> 02:20:56.848]  And now, I can tell you, we're in that zone of completion.
[02:20:56.868 --> 02:21:01.809]  We're in that zone where now everything we're doing is what everything was building towards.
[02:21:02.930 --> 02:21:22.806]   If you think Infowars, waking up people to the New World Order, exposing the globalist pedophile rings, exposing the GMO takeover, if you think that was powerful before, Think again, because what is happening now is the most important thing this operation has ever done.
[02:21:22.866 --> 02:21:23.967]  And I want to explain something.
[02:21:24.788 --> 02:21:28.951]  When I give that credit, and I give that credit to you, that's not to pat you on the head.
[02:21:29.752 --> 02:21:31.974]  That's so you realize that this is you.
[02:21:32.775 --> 02:21:41.463]  Your word of mouth, your prayer, your support, you buying the products, all of that brought us to this point together today.
[02:21:43.467 --> 02:21:47.070]  And so I would expect that actually in God's mystery that we're maxed out.
[02:21:47.111 --> 02:21:48.352]  We're out of funds.
[02:21:48.412 --> 02:21:50.814]  We're on empty because that's where humanity is.
[02:21:53.857 --> 02:21:58.421]  We're not going to come into the final round of this fight and be like, like we got in the first round.
[02:21:58.461 --> 02:21:59.162]  We all feel great.
[02:21:59.222 --> 02:22:02.065]  We just jumped a bunch of rope and we're now in the ring.
[02:22:02.125 --> 02:22:08.611]  Now we've been in 11 rounds of war and it's about who's got the will now at this point.
[02:22:10.484 --> 02:22:20.531]  So when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for the broadcast, and that's the most important, and when you buy the products, which is critical to keep us on air, when you do that, you're in the fight for your own life.
[02:22:20.551 --> 02:22:21.752]  You're in the fight for the future.
[02:22:22.612 --> 02:22:23.393]  There's a lot of fraud.
[02:22:23.433 --> 02:22:25.194]  There's Hollywood out there, but this is the real deal.
[02:22:26.335 --> 02:22:26.975]  Everybody knows it.
[02:22:27.395 --> 02:22:28.076]  This is the real deal.
[02:22:28.096 --> 02:22:29.477]  That's why they hate it.
[02:22:29.657 --> 02:22:30.778]  This is the genuine.
[02:22:31.178 --> 02:22:32.018]  You are the genuine.
[02:22:32.619 --> 02:22:34.040]  We are the real thing here.
[02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:35.301]  They can't stand it.
[02:22:37.216 --> 02:22:38.657]  Go to Infowarestore.com.
[02:22:38.717 --> 02:22:42.580]  I talked about this earlier today, because I'm just doing accounting and math, trying to find money.
[02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:45.582]  And they keep telling me this over the years, but I finally got the accounting.
[02:22:46.063 --> 02:22:52.227]  Over 200 t-shirts that I've designed in the last couple of years, that I never promoted, almost all of them.
[02:22:52.767 --> 02:22:54.229]  I go, order 5,000 a shirt.
[02:22:54.369 --> 02:22:54.749]  Okay.
[02:22:56.350 --> 02:22:58.312]  Most of it you never saw, never pushed.
[02:22:58.792 --> 02:23:00.633]  We'll order 1,000 of them, we sell 10 of them.
[02:23:01.154 --> 02:23:10.250]   We have almost $500,000 at cost t-shirts and and then it's my fault because it's you know I
[02:23:10.250 --> 02:23:13.380]   just don't make this shirt make that shirt you can't even find them all we're
[02:23:13.380 --> 02:23:17.121]   gonna try to build a site on info or store.com next few days that has
[02:23:17.121 --> 02:23:24.700]   all 220 something shirts on it and these are limited edition shirts and so we're
[02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:28.821]   gonna sell them at cost
[02:23:27.735 --> 02:23:29.196]  Some of them are sold at cost right now.
[02:23:29.296 --> 02:23:29.676]  Some aren't.
[02:23:29.696 --> 02:23:30.137]  Doesn't matter.
[02:23:30.657 --> 02:23:32.618]  I just need to pay the bills and stay on air.
[02:23:33.159 --> 02:23:35.380]  And in the future, I'm going to have two or three shirts we sell.
[02:23:35.720 --> 02:23:36.481]  They'll be limited edition.
[02:23:36.501 --> 02:23:37.261]  We'll move the next shirt.
[02:23:37.722 --> 02:23:38.762]  Not, oh, I like this.
[02:23:38.862 --> 02:23:39.363]  I like that.
[02:23:39.443 --> 02:23:39.763]  Do this.
[02:23:39.803 --> 02:23:40.083]  Do that.
[02:23:40.303 --> 02:23:41.044]  I like this design.
[02:23:41.264 --> 02:23:41.984]  I like that design.
[02:23:42.024 --> 02:23:42.285]  Do that.
[02:23:42.305 --> 02:23:43.986]  I mean, all these things is Alex Jones.
[02:23:44.909 --> 02:23:46.829]  This is all stuff I came up with, all things I did.
[02:23:46.849 --> 02:23:48.490]  That's why I'll be honest with you.
[02:23:48.510 --> 02:23:49.750]  Some of it's the best shirts ever.
[02:23:50.130 --> 02:23:51.571]  Some of it's like, okay, that's an okay shirt.
[02:23:51.911 --> 02:23:57.712]  The point is it funds the operation and you can get it very inexpensively right now at infowarestore.com.
[02:23:58.572 --> 02:24:11.075]  So please help us clear this inventory out because we're doing the math and we're like, man, I'm like $200,000, $300,000 a month in the hole because of bandwidth, because we're so popular, but nobody's buying product.
[02:24:11.416 --> 02:24:12.036]  What's going on?
[02:24:12.056 --> 02:24:14.156]  And we're like, well, there it is.
[02:24:14.156 --> 02:24:20.355]   Designer shirts, low price shirts, it's all there, infowarestore.com.
[02:24:20.355 --> 02:24:22.415]  And we've got to get rid of these shirts.
[02:24:22.415 --> 02:24:23.615]  And here's the deal.
[02:24:23.615 --> 02:24:29.176]   These are all limited edition, including all the old classics that weren't limited edition,
[02:24:29.176 --> 02:24:33.816]   they're now all limited edition, whether it's the Tyranny Response Team shirts,
[02:24:33.816 --> 02:24:41.575]   or whether it is the classic InfoWars shirts, or the Mass Murderers Agree, Gun Control Works shirts,
[02:24:41.828 --> 02:24:46.448]  We may make new versions of those maybe in the future, but these are all limited editions.
[02:24:46.869 --> 02:24:47.509]  They're over.
[02:24:48.649 --> 02:24:52.510]  Over 200 shirts, half a million dollars of them in there.
[02:24:53.050 --> 02:24:54.330]  That's what it cost me to make them.
[02:24:54.990 --> 02:24:59.111]  We are selling them off now and we need the funds.
[02:25:00.782 --> 02:25:03.283]  So I don't care if it's the Infowars in your face shirt.
[02:25:03.344 --> 02:25:04.144]  That's a bestseller.
[02:25:04.264 --> 02:25:04.704]  It's over.
[02:25:05.065 --> 02:25:06.385]  Operation 51st State shirt.
[02:25:06.545 --> 02:25:06.986]  It's over.
[02:25:08.246 --> 02:25:09.507]  Make Austin, Texas again.
[02:25:09.607 --> 02:25:10.087]  It's gone.
[02:25:10.408 --> 02:25:11.488]  The Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:25:11.508 --> 02:25:13.009]  That's sold out, so there's no problem there.
[02:25:13.710 --> 02:25:14.870]  Trump is innocent shirt.
[02:25:15.771 --> 02:25:17.192]  Come and impeach it shirts.
[02:25:18.232 --> 02:25:18.753]  All of it.
[02:25:19.993 --> 02:25:20.774]  51st State shirts.
[02:25:21.514 --> 02:25:22.655]  Beto not shirts.
[02:25:24.209 --> 02:25:25.410]  Don't tread on me, shirts.
[02:25:26.350 --> 02:25:28.031]  Alex Jones did nothing wrong, shirts.
[02:25:28.852 --> 02:25:34.935]  All of them are selling out at the lowest price we can sell them at cost to make our money back.
[02:25:35.676 --> 02:25:39.578]  Go to infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.

[02:25:42.980 --> 02:25:48.423]  Infowarestore.com and help me clear out all of that excess stuff.
[02:25:49.143 --> 02:25:51.165]  Now, what's not excess stuff is this.
[02:25:51.905 --> 02:25:53.386]  This is completely limited edition.
[02:25:54.758 --> 02:26:01.300]  Made right here in America, 999 silver, and it's the second of a three-part series, the Founder Coin.
[02:26:02.141 --> 02:26:04.442]  We've already sold 4,000 of these in two days.
[02:26:04.982 --> 02:26:06.022]  There's 10,000 of them.
[02:26:06.062 --> 02:26:13.425]  It's the Tree of Liberty coin with the famous Thomas Jefferson quote about the Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[02:26:14.205 --> 02:26:24.123]   And everybody that wants to give us their email, With this Founder Coin, we'll get exclusive content and more in the near future from your investment, buying this coin to keep us on air.
[02:26:24.844 --> 02:26:29.505]  Infoworkstore.com or 1776coin.com.
[02:26:30.205 --> 02:26:35.786]  You go to 1776coin.com, that's PatriotCollectibles.com, and we're going to launch so much from this.
[02:26:36.266 --> 02:26:37.106]  It's going to be amazing.
[02:26:37.146 --> 02:26:40.227]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:26:41.204 --> 02:26:57.091]  What you've been doing because we are up against the new world order at point-blank range and we are reaching millions and millions of people a day and it's true we are reaching world leaders and all the major thought leaders because we are ahead of the curve here.
[02:26:57.609 --> 02:27:03.089]   And used to I was 90% of all the breaking stuff, now I'm about 50%.
[02:27:03.089 --> 02:27:04.689]  I'm making myself obsolete.
[02:27:04.689 --> 02:27:11.128]   As soon as we get to where I'm not the one always breaking the original data and trailblazing,
[02:27:11.128 --> 02:27:13.208]  I'm gonna end this, okay?
[02:27:14.065 --> 02:27:15.065]  But we're not there yet.
[02:27:15.626 --> 02:27:18.867]  And then I'll sit back, and if I see something going on, I'm gonna come out.
[02:27:19.368 --> 02:27:22.990]  But I've done 28 years of this, and I've almost completed my mission.
[02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:34.116]  But this next year or two is the most important part of my mission ever, and I need funds, and I need prayer, and I need word of mouth to absolutely smash the enemy.
[02:27:34.436 --> 02:27:41.775]   Because you know that famous internet saying, If the situation was hopeless, the propaganda would not be necessary.
[02:27:41.815 --> 02:27:43.456]  They're not trying to censor you and me.
[02:27:43.816 --> 02:27:45.096]  They're not trying to suppress us.
[02:27:45.116 --> 02:27:46.977]  They're not trying to intimidate us.
[02:27:47.017 --> 02:27:49.678]  They're not trying to debank us because we're weak.
[02:27:50.178 --> 02:27:53.059]  They're doing it because we are strong.
[02:27:54.164 --> 02:27:59.305]  And so all you've done over these years, maximize it in word of mouth now.
[02:27:59.925 --> 02:28:02.426]  All you've done in prayer, maximize it now.
[02:28:02.806 --> 02:28:24.991]   And all you've done buying products at m4warrestore.com, maximize it so that I can go into this big fight now, full power against the establishment who just shake in fear and hatred because together with God's Holy Spirit, we have broken the enemy over and over again and this place just Effervescently spews success and victory.
[02:28:25.351 --> 02:28:33.474]  All of our guests, all of our guest hosts, all of our callers, everything we do is human strength through God and is absolutely beautiful.
[02:28:34.115 --> 02:28:39.097]  The only way you fail, and I don't care which three you do or if you do all three, that'd be great.
[02:28:39.537 --> 02:28:40.097]  Pray for us.
[02:28:40.557 --> 02:28:41.417]  Spread the word about us.
[02:28:41.778 --> 02:28:42.418]  Buy the products.
[02:28:42.838 --> 02:28:43.518]  Buy the products.
[02:28:43.818 --> 02:28:44.439]  Spread the word.
[02:28:44.679 --> 02:28:45.139]  Pray for us.
[02:28:45.819 --> 02:28:46.359]  Pray for us.
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:47.260]  Spread the word.
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:48.201]  Buy the products.
[02:28:48.501 --> 02:28:51.303]  But whatever you do, take action now!
[02:28:51.724 --> 02:28:57.368]  And if you think there's some other talk show host or some other place doing a better job, I all mean support them.
[02:28:57.669 --> 02:29:00.551]  But whatever you do now, this is the big test.
[02:29:00.571 --> 02:29:09.018]  When the pedophiles are coming out in the open, and the world government's coming out in the open, and the crime's exploding and all of it, this is the time for us to shine.
[02:29:09.398 --> 02:29:10.140]  Thank you for your support.
[02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:11.923]  Kate Dowling of katedowlingshow.com.
[02:29:12.223 --> 02:29:13.185]  Thanks over on the other side.
[02:29:13.425 --> 02:29:19.235]  And then a team on us, 45 minutes, Owen Schroyer and the vaunted, dreaded War Room, 3 p.m.
[02:29:19.275 --> 02:29:19.696]  Central.
[02:29:20.157 --> 02:29:21.038]  I salute you all.
[02:29:21.279 --> 02:29:22.521]  We'll see you on the other side.
[02:29:22.360 --> 02:29:36.440]  Stay with us.
[02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:44.719]   In December of 2021, InfoWars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 Anti-Tyrant
[02:29:44.719 --> 02:29:47.640]  Coin, and it sold out in 10 days.
[02:29:47.951 --> 02:29:55.539]   And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, A founding member coin, we would not be on air today.
[02:29:55.939 --> 02:30:03.023]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree coin, is being offered and it will probably sell out in 10 days again.
[02:30:03.383 --> 02:30:05.445]  It certainly needs to be put under operation.
[02:30:05.845 --> 02:30:14.230]  It is so historic and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty being refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants and more.
[02:30:14.710 --> 02:30:20.633]   See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com It's also at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:30:20.953 --> 02:30:21.613]  It's amazing.
[02:30:21.873 --> 02:30:23.373]  There's only 10,000 of them.
[02:30:23.713 --> 02:30:31.436]  And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air, we're planning something very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[02:30:31.756 --> 02:30:34.496]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[02:30:36.940 --> 02:30:38.461]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:38.501 --> 02:30:41.224]  I'm Kate Dally from Kate Dally Radio, your guest host.
[02:30:41.304 --> 02:30:42.985]  Wow, what a great show today, Alex.
[02:30:43.325 --> 02:30:45.507]  I love the guests and very powerful.
[02:30:45.607 --> 02:30:51.032]  And by the way, we're going to need our vitamins, so make sure you're taking those supplements he was talking about and also the t-shirts.
[02:30:51.332 --> 02:30:53.654]  The supplements are so important because we need our immune systems.
[02:30:54.175 --> 02:30:57.537]  We need to get them in tip-top shape right now.
[02:30:58.497 --> 02:31:00.198]  So I have a great guest for you today.
[02:31:00.419 --> 02:31:01.980]  In fact, a very powerful guest.
[02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:09.444]  And I'm always looking to challenge myself and my thinking and my covering everything and my talking about everything that needs to be talked about.
[02:31:09.843 --> 02:31:13.843]   and especially those that involve slight of hand with the deep state.
[02:31:13.843 --> 02:31:17.022]  Because we know that's a huge constant tactic for them.
[02:31:17.022 --> 02:31:21.343]   So the topic today is little talked about, so of course I'm interested and intrigued,
[02:31:21.343 --> 02:31:25.262]   and I've invited Bart Sabrell on with me because let me just tell you,
[02:31:25.262 --> 02:31:29.062]   he's written some fantastic books, he's an award-winning filmmaker,
[02:31:29.062 --> 02:31:34.623]   writer, investigative journalist, and also has produced many television programs
[02:31:34.623 --> 02:31:37.743]  and documentaries, Fox, HBO, you name it.
[02:31:37.775 --> 02:31:40.757]  A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon, that's how I met him before.
[02:31:41.097 --> 02:31:48.300]  And then of course, Astronauts Gone Wild and his latest is Moon Man, the True Story of a Filmmaker on the CIA Hit List.
[02:31:48.340 --> 02:31:49.441]  Welcome Bart, how are you?
[02:31:50.641 --> 02:31:51.902]  Doing good Kate, how about yourself?
[02:31:52.918 --> 02:31:54.179]  I'm excellent, I'm excellent.
[02:31:54.219 --> 02:32:04.863]  So, Planet X is a topic that I've talked little about, to tell you the truth, and I'm intrigued by it because I read about it from you.
[02:32:05.223 --> 02:32:12.786]  And I want to talk about Planet X a little bit more because I thought you had some very original ideas about this and some very interesting comments.
[02:32:13.246 --> 02:32:15.007]  And so I can't wait to get into this with you.
[02:32:15.407 --> 02:32:18.009]  So, tell me about Planet X early on.
[02:32:18.209 --> 02:32:27.954]  Our first, really kind of, you know, the first information that we received about Planet X and why this is so important and it's so little talked about.
[02:32:29.515 --> 02:32:38.820]  Well, there used to be a video, it was online, they took it down, when people started investigating Planet X. It was actually a NASA promotional video, I think from 1972, when they launched Pioneer 10.
[02:32:42.573 --> 02:32:54.275]  And it said that the purpose of it was to find Planet X. And then when they launched Voyager 1 and 2 a few years later, by having three spacecraft in the area, they intended to triangulate the location.
[02:32:54.896 --> 02:33:06.438]  And even the Washington Post and other magazines, newspapers, admitted that they have found Planet X with a special infrared telescope, because you can't see it with an optical telescope.
[02:33:07.509 --> 02:33:14.157]  And then no one ever talks about it for another 20 years and another generation of people find it and then they don't talk about it again.
[02:33:15.099 --> 02:33:18.884]  When I was researching the film, a funny thing happened on the way to the moon.
[02:33:18.924 --> 02:33:21.928]  I remember talking to a senior executive at NASA.
[02:33:22.640 --> 02:33:24.402]  And he said, yes, you're right, Bart.
[02:33:24.622 --> 02:33:25.883]  They did not go to the moon.
[02:33:26.384 --> 02:33:30.288]  However, there's a more important topic that you should investigate.
[02:33:30.348 --> 02:33:31.349]  I'm like, well, tell me.
[02:33:31.889 --> 02:33:35.453]  And he said, Planet X. I, of course, asked, what is that all about?
[02:33:35.874 --> 02:33:43.317]   He said it's a rogue planet that is expected to come a near past to Earth in the first half of the next century.
[02:33:43.417 --> 02:33:47.718]  At the time, it was like 30 years or so into the future, so I'm like, well, whatever.
[02:33:48.118 --> 02:33:50.179]  I've got more important things to think about.
[02:33:50.679 --> 02:33:57.500]  And now that God has allowed me to live another 30 years, oh, I guess it's about that time, isn't it?
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:03.201]  And then, you know, you know about, allegedly, the style of the people who run the world.
[02:34:03.241 --> 02:34:05.382]  You can call them Illuminati or whatever.
[02:34:05.962 --> 02:34:10.985]  Their, you know, style is to technically warn people about what they're doing.
[02:34:11.065 --> 02:34:30.397]  So, about three years ago, a lot of the mainstream science magazines, and I can show them to you, but, you know, Science.com, National Geographic, and many others released multiple articles saying rogue planets are very real, and that there's actually statistically two rogue planets for every solar system.
[02:34:30.817 --> 02:34:55.687]   Rogue planets either just free float, through the solar system and they're generally about seven times larger than the earth and of course they could collide with the earth or they have this eccentric tilted orbit kind of like a comet and so when I started researching this I was alarmed to discover that both the historical record and the biblical record of such events actually match
[02:34:56.754 --> 02:35:12.770]  And when I talked to a completely, you know, secular, non-believer scientist who believes in rogue planets, he kind of listed the things that would happen if one came near the Earth, like an increase of earthquakes, meteor showers, tidal effects, things like that.
[02:35:12.830 --> 02:35:13.831]  And I said, well, wait a minute.
[02:35:14.480 --> 02:35:17.563]  That's exactly what the Bible says is going to happen in the last days.
[02:35:17.944 --> 02:35:19.165]  There'll be meteor storms.
[02:35:19.265 --> 02:35:22.648]  Jesus said, you know, the stars will fall like ripe figs.
[02:35:22.689 --> 02:35:23.750]  That's a meteor storm.
[02:35:24.270 --> 02:35:47.769]   In fact, one of the greatest events in human history, hardly anybody knows about it, it's not taught in university, and that is that prior to the year 705 BC, Every civilization of the world that had good astronomers like the Mayans, the Sumerians, the Egyptians, the Hebrews, and the Chinese, they all had the Earth having a 360-day year.
[02:35:50.444 --> 02:35:53.345]  That's why there's 360 degrees on a compass.
[02:35:53.846 --> 02:35:57.847]  And then all of a sudden, around 705 BC, something happened.
[02:35:58.428 --> 02:36:05.051]  And immediately after, all those civilizations changed their calendars to 365 and a quarter.
[02:36:05.150 --> 02:36:12.950]   So what happened obviously is that the earth was pulled further away from the sun slightly.
[02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:20.670]   In fact this is recorded indirectly in 2 Kings chapter 20 when the prophet Isaiah said show
[02:36:20.670 --> 02:36:25.970]   me a sign that King Hezekiah is going to live another 15 years and God said I can make the
[02:36:25.970 --> 02:36:30.170]   sundial go forward or backward would you like and he's like I think the back is harder so
[02:36:30.170 --> 02:36:31.350]  show me that.
[02:36:31.350 --> 02:36:37.110]   It wasn't really a sundial it was steps and so each step theoretically represented an
[02:36:37.582 --> 02:36:44.830]  So rather than the Earth having to go backwards and then forwards again, the Earth would simply have to tilt.
[02:36:44.930 --> 02:36:46.852]  And maybe that's where our tilt came from.
[02:36:47.452 --> 02:36:58.389]   And then when I read the book of Isaiah recently, I realize that not only is the book of Daniel and Revelation about the last days, Isaiah is about the last days.
[02:36:58.969 --> 02:37:02.352]  Over and over again, when it says the day of the Lord, that's the second coming.
[02:37:02.772 --> 02:37:05.774]  So, guess what it says in Isaiah 13, 13?
[02:37:06.755 --> 02:37:15.522]  It says, about the last days, the coming days of the Lord, the earth will be moved out of its place, just like it was in 705 BC.
[02:37:18.166 --> 02:37:18.746]  Absolutely.
[02:37:18.786 --> 02:37:21.548]  In fact, there's several references to that that I have found.
[02:37:21.568 --> 02:37:25.210]  It's really intriguing because you have to wonder how that exactly happens.
[02:37:25.370 --> 02:37:29.233]  And this does not, Planet X, does not rotate normally.
[02:37:29.593 --> 02:37:35.236]  And so, this is something that is also what intrigued me about this part was it's so little talked about.
[02:37:35.756 --> 02:37:36.977]  No one brings this up.
[02:37:37.057 --> 02:37:38.978]  And if they do, they never bring it up again.
[02:37:39.278 --> 02:37:45.042]  Just like, what was it, Harrington from the Naval Observatory talked about it, never talked about it again.
[02:37:46.007 --> 02:37:46.367]  That's weird.
[02:37:46.387 --> 02:37:47.428]  Yeah, I wrote an article.
[02:37:47.528 --> 02:37:50.169]  It took me about 200 hours to write.
[02:37:50.249 --> 02:37:54.191]  I've done 30 drafts of it based on 500 hours of research.
[02:37:54.231 --> 02:38:00.134]  You can read it at Sibrell, S as in Sam, I, B as in boy, R-E-L, Sibrell.com.
[02:38:00.694 --> 02:38:03.455]  And it's full of mind-boggling discoveries.
[02:38:03.535 --> 02:38:13.600]  For example, the most powerful telescope in the world is owned by the Vatican and the Jesuit sect of the Vatican, which is kind of like their CIA.
[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:19.163]  And it is named, get this, the Lucifer Telescope.
[02:38:19.884 --> 02:38:25.107]  Now why would an alleged Christian organization, you know, name something after Lucifer?
[02:38:25.707 --> 02:38:41.930]   So there was a guy named Malachi Martin and on his deathbed he disavowed the sect because of their criminality and he said that the Lucifer Telescope is tracking an object that will play a significant part in world history in the last days.
[02:38:42.690 --> 02:38:50.135]  I think they're tracking Planet X, which they have dubbed Planet Lucifer, the Destroyer.
[02:38:50.556 --> 02:39:05.426]  And oddly enough, in 1045 AD, the Chinese saw a passing of Planet X, and they called it the Dragon, because once it does become visible, it becomes red and had wings of meteor storms on each side of it.
[02:39:05.907 --> 02:39:10.495]  So we have all these indications dropping in that this could very well be true.
[02:39:10.515 --> 02:39:14.402]  We're going to come right back more with Bart Sabro when we come back.
[02:39:14.442 --> 02:39:15.684]  You're not going to want to miss this.
[02:39:15.784 --> 02:39:16.606]  You've got to hear this.
[02:39:17.267 --> 02:39:17.788]  Be right back.
[02:39:17.848 --> 02:39:18.950]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[02:39:19.750 --> 02:39:25.013]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show and of course I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[02:39:25.473 --> 02:39:40.777]   You know, very few topics, I've covered just about every single topic I can imagine and whenever it came to Planet X, I always just sort of rolled my eyes and just kept walking because I always thought it was a really weird concept, right? And no one was ever talking about it. So I
[02:39:40.777 --> 02:39:45.497]   just sort of bypassed it all together. But Bart actually brought up some really
[02:39:45.497 --> 02:39:51.206]   wonderful things about this that I had not talked about ever. And when I say wonderful, I mean
[02:39:51.206 --> 02:39:56.226]   kind of scary about this topic and really made me think about this in a totally
[02:39:56.226 --> 02:39:57.656]  different way.
[02:39:57.674 --> 02:40:08.545]  In fact, when you brought up the fact that Janet Napolitano in your writings, outgoing director of Homeland Security, said something kind of startling and alarming right as she was leaving in her farewell speech.
[02:40:08.605 --> 02:40:14.131]  She said, a natural disaster the likes of which the nation has never seen, Bart, is likely on its way.
[02:40:14.731 --> 02:40:17.715]  And I thought, and like you, wait, we have seen everything.
[02:40:17.775 --> 02:40:22.020]  We've seen tornadoes, we've seen tsunamis, we've seen just about everything we can see.
[02:40:22.460 --> 02:40:26.244]  What do you mean the likes of which the nation has never seen?
[02:40:26.545 --> 02:40:27.326]  That was interesting.
[02:40:28.046 --> 02:40:29.008]  I hadn't thought about it that way.
[02:40:29.932 --> 02:40:31.593]  There's actually three clues there.
[02:40:31.653 --> 02:40:41.341]  You know, it's interesting that just as Eisenhower had his deep state warning the last day in office so they wouldn't shoot him, she said something her last day in office.
[02:40:41.421 --> 02:40:45.124]  You know, kind of like her way of, you know, being able to sleep at night, I guess.
[02:40:45.584 --> 02:40:47.166]  There's actually three clues in that.
[02:40:47.246 --> 02:40:50.448]  We know that it's a natural disaster, what is coming.
[02:40:50.808 --> 02:40:56.928]   And I think this whole coronavirus thing is actually a psychological drill for that event
[02:40:56.928 --> 02:41:02.468]   to kind of train people to submit to emergency, you know, martial law.
[02:41:02.468 --> 02:41:10.048]   Then the second clue is that it's never happened in the 246 years of America and it is a natural
[02:41:10.048 --> 02:41:16.647]   disaster you could know about a decade or more in advance because she said that in 2013.
[02:41:16.647 --> 02:41:22.728]   So we've seen, like you said, volcanoes, hurricanes, everything else, and those cannot be predicted
[02:41:22.728 --> 02:41:23.487]  in advance.
[02:41:23.754 --> 02:41:32.981]  The only natural disaster that the United States has never seen, that you could predict years in advance, has to be something coming from outer space.
[02:41:33.802 --> 02:41:44.089]  Because of the mathematical precision of being able to, you know, calculate the position and trajectory of comets, asteroids, and potentially, in this case, a rogue planet.
[02:41:44.602 --> 02:41:51.364]  Remember, Jesus said that in the last days there would be greater tribulation than in the whole history of the world.
[02:41:51.424 --> 02:41:57.845]  And I believe that's because we're going to have every possible disaster happening simultaneously.
[02:41:57.986 --> 02:42:04.027]  Economic collapse, pandemic, food shortages, increasing earthquakes, and meteor storms.
[02:42:04.487 --> 02:42:07.348]  And there's many warnings about this in the book of Revelation.
[02:42:08.007 --> 02:42:16.073]  My best source thinks that Planet X is about seven times larger than the Earth, which would be about 30 times larger than the moon.
[02:42:16.553 --> 02:42:28.922]  So one of the warnings that Jesus gave, interestingly, about the last days, is he said, men's hearts will melt with fear because of the tossing and turning of the seas.
[02:42:29.463 --> 02:42:34.647]  Now we have daily tidal effect that in some cases makes the ocean go in and out about 20 feet.
[02:42:35.982 --> 02:42:45.445]  But massive tossing and turning of the seas could very well be caused by an object 30 times larger than the moon coming by.
[02:42:46.045 --> 02:42:47.625]  And so there are many indications.
[02:42:47.645 --> 02:42:50.646]  He said there'd be a greater increase in earthquakes.
[02:42:50.686 --> 02:43:00.749]  Well, earthquakes have increased by about 1000% in the last 10 years, and some believe it's because of the gravitational effects as Planet X approaches.
[02:43:02.610 --> 02:43:02.790]  Wow.
[02:43:03.393 --> 02:43:14.715]  You know, one thing that you said that really struck me and I'd never really thought about it in this way, you brought up a lot of things, we're only hitting on a few, but that in the scriptures it talks about it will come as a thief in the night.
[02:43:15.567 --> 02:43:26.294]  And what's interesting is, is we talk about all the things that can happen and I always thought all of the things that you just mentioned would come by way of, say, harp, would come by way of, say, manipulation by the deep state.
[02:43:26.314 --> 02:43:28.956]  I know they can manipulate weather, they can manipulate a lot of things.
[02:43:28.976 --> 02:43:30.357]  They could even do underwater nukes.
[02:43:30.377 --> 02:43:34.120]  They could do all kinds of things to cause the water to rise and things like this.
[02:43:34.793 --> 02:43:41.576]  But it was interesting when you said Thief of the Night, Thief in the Night, because I started really examining that phrase.
[02:43:41.776 --> 02:43:47.339]  It was such a different, it's such a different way to think about it in the fact that no one talks about this.
[02:43:47.479 --> 02:43:48.839]  Talk about misdirection.
[02:43:48.999 --> 02:43:57.143]  If this is something that's coming and they know it, this is why they built all the bunkers, very interesting to go hide in, of course, but not for us, right?
[02:43:57.703 --> 02:43:58.344]  Not the peons.
[02:43:59.384 --> 02:44:06.590]  It would be as a thief in the night if no one's ever discussing it, no one's talking about it, and anyone that does talk about it never talks about it again.
[02:44:06.610 --> 02:44:08.131]  I thought that was fascinating.
[02:44:09.252 --> 02:44:22.123]  I've been, you know, studying like everybody else in our circles the, you know, COVID fake pandemic for quite a while, and it was only very recently I came to an expanded conclusion as to exactly why they are doing it.
[02:44:22.603 --> 02:44:24.905]  Number one, it's a psychological drill.
[02:44:25.746 --> 02:44:30.408]  To program people to submit to the government during national emergencies.
[02:44:30.468 --> 02:44:32.188]  We know that these injections are deadly.
[02:44:32.248 --> 02:44:39.831]  The VP of Pfizer said so himself and said in almost disbelief, they must be wanting to kill hundreds of millions of people.
[02:44:39.911 --> 02:44:41.211]  There's no other explanation.
[02:44:41.291 --> 02:44:43.092]  Now, why are they doing that?
[02:44:43.812 --> 02:44:46.373]  I think they know this event is coming.
[02:44:46.553 --> 02:44:49.134]  Planet X, a comet, asteroid, or all of them.
[02:44:49.944 --> 02:44:55.648]  And if it does, and when it does, it could kill half the world's population in six months.
[02:44:56.028 --> 02:44:58.910]  They don't want to shock the earth that way.
[02:44:58.970 --> 02:44:59.951]  They like to travel.
[02:44:59.991 --> 02:45:02.672]  They like to go to hotels and have restaurants.
[02:45:02.712 --> 02:45:10.597]  So they're killing off segments of the population gradually because they consider everyone they're going to die anyway.
[02:45:11.078 --> 02:45:24.328]   And what a coincidence that the first people who get phase one congratulations are the very same list As on Hitler's useless eaters, the disabled, the, you know, the diabetic, the elderly, the overweight.
[02:45:24.408 --> 02:45:40.122]  So I believe these injections are designed to lower the population gradually so that when the cosmic event happens, most of the population or whatever percentage they've designed will already be dead and it'll be less of a shock to society.
[02:45:40.142 --> 02:45:41.723]  Right.
[02:45:42.409 --> 02:45:43.669]  Also, great points by the way.
[02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:49.391]  Also, you know, as far as it hitting the whole world, there's a lot of references to that in the good book, you know?
[02:45:49.451 --> 02:45:52.753]  There's a lot of things that say the whole world will be impacted.
[02:45:53.173 --> 02:46:03.256]  And when I used to think about, you know, meteors and things like that coming down, a lot of people would be affected, a lot of land would be affected, but it would be more targeted.
[02:46:03.356 --> 02:46:06.497]  This actually would affect the whole world at one time.
[02:46:06.557 --> 02:46:15.241]   Yeah, you know, The book of Joel is quoted in Acts at the first preaching of the word to strangers.
[02:46:15.562 --> 02:46:21.406]  And they say that in the last days, which is now, many believers will have dreams and visions.
[02:46:21.467 --> 02:46:23.909]  Well, I had a heart procedure recently.
[02:46:23.969 --> 02:46:28.713]  They didn't have to cut me open, thank goodness, but they went into a vein and poked a hole in my heart and all that.
[02:46:29.914 --> 02:46:33.997]  When I woke up, maybe from the anesthesia, it was such a good rest.
[02:46:34.037 --> 02:46:36.699]  I mean, I was just wide awake for more than 24 hours.
[02:46:38.232 --> 02:46:49.960]  And the split second I fell asleep, I saw a literal vision of white letters in front of me, just like at the beginning of a funny thing happened on the way to the moon of the scriptures there.
[02:46:49.980 --> 02:46:52.862]  And it said, Luke 21 11.
[02:46:53.703 --> 02:46:55.284]  And that's pretty specific, right?
[02:46:55.684 --> 02:47:02.329]  So I looked that up and it's Jesus answering the questions about the signs of the end of the age.
[02:47:02.429 --> 02:47:07.192]  He said there will be great signs in the heavens.
[02:47:08.101 --> 02:47:11.643]  And disease pandemics and food shortages.
[02:47:12.143 --> 02:47:15.365]  And then about two months ago, I had a dream.
[02:47:15.565 --> 02:47:18.906]  And in the dream, I saw the front license plate of a car.
[02:47:18.966 --> 02:47:21.848]  Now in my state, you're only required to have one on the back.
[02:47:21.928 --> 02:47:24.069]  The front, you can put whatever you want.
[02:47:24.898 --> 02:47:26.739]  It said, Mark 13, 13 through 14.
[02:47:27.659 --> 02:47:30.280]  Now, that's pretty specific, isn't it?
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:32.581]  So, I looked that up, too.
[02:47:33.281 --> 02:47:36.962]  And it's, again, Jesus talking about the last days.
[02:47:37.222 --> 02:47:43.104]  And the part of that that stood out to me, Kate, is flee to the mountains.
[02:47:43.824 --> 02:47:48.646]  So, I think God is telling me in the first time, the end times have begun.
[02:47:48.966 --> 02:47:50.447]  No more wondering about it.
[02:47:50.547 --> 02:47:51.187]  This is it.
[02:47:51.647 --> 02:47:59.377]   And in the second dream, I think God is telling me Now is the time to flee to the mountains or prepare physically.
[02:47:59.818 --> 02:48:03.781]  Now, a lot of believers I know, they say that, well, God will take care of them.
[02:48:04.161 --> 02:48:07.443]  But you have to look at what happened in the Old Testament.
[02:48:07.864 --> 02:48:17.251]  I have a minister who said that the tribulation that happened locally, like being thrown into a fiery furnace or the famine, will be worldwide in the last days.
[02:48:17.271 --> 02:48:20.073]  Those are symbolic and lessons for us now.
[02:48:20.862 --> 02:48:24.283]  Well, Joseph predicted the seven years of coming famine.
[02:48:24.583 --> 02:48:26.344]  He believed in God more than anybody.
[02:48:26.404 --> 02:48:29.745]  Did God drop food from the sky for seven years?
[02:48:29.765 --> 02:48:30.125]  No.
[02:48:31.045 --> 02:48:36.387]  The Bible says God said out of his own mouth, my people are destroyed for the lack of knowledge.
[02:48:36.487 --> 02:48:40.288]  He survived the tribulation by preparing for it.
[02:48:40.548 --> 02:48:43.109]  You see, he stockpiled food.
[02:48:43.249 --> 02:48:44.629]  He was a prepper.
[02:48:45.130 --> 02:48:46.510]  That's how God provided.
[02:48:49.310 --> 02:48:53.433]  We're going to come right back.
[02:48:53.693 --> 02:48:56.214]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host, katedallyradio.com.
[02:48:56.294 --> 02:48:59.056]  On the Alex Jones Show, be right back with Bart Sabrell.
[02:48:59.536 --> 02:49:01.557]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:49:01.617 --> 02:49:04.318]  So happy to be here today and I've got a great guest.
[02:49:04.358 --> 02:49:07.780]  I hope he makes all of us think because I've learned a lot from Bart.
[02:49:07.860 --> 02:49:08.781]  It's been really interesting.
[02:49:08.801 --> 02:49:12.883]  This was a topic that I wasn't even interested in until I read Bart's piece on it.
[02:49:13.243 --> 02:49:14.744]  And he brought up some interesting points.
[02:49:14.784 --> 02:49:15.764]  So kudos to you, Bart.
[02:49:16.224 --> 02:49:19.705]  And of course, living on a mountain sounds real good about now, I'm thinking.
[02:49:20.465 --> 02:49:22.086]  And getting prepared, like you said.
[02:49:22.886 --> 02:49:24.126]  You know, people prepped.
[02:49:24.206 --> 02:49:27.608]  That's how they made it through these times that we can go read about.
[02:49:28.208 --> 02:49:31.029]  And it's a very, very good point, and I appreciate that.
[02:49:31.049 --> 02:49:32.969]  I hope everybody's getting food storage right now.
[02:49:33.029 --> 02:49:38.091]  I hope everybody's ordering extra supplements on Alex's site because a food shortage is coming.
[02:49:38.111 --> 02:49:39.351]  You're going to want those supplements.
[02:49:39.431 --> 02:49:41.612]  And by the way, they keep on the shelf, so I'd get extra.
[02:49:42.212 --> 02:49:48.239]  Also, if you haven't checked out Bart Sabraw's movies and books, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon is how I met Bart in the first place.
[02:49:48.620 --> 02:49:55.247]  And then, of course, his amazing information, also Moon Man, the true story of a filmmaker on the CIA hit list.
[02:49:55.668 --> 02:49:57.049]  And so you must check these out.
[02:49:57.089 --> 02:50:00.073]  But man, Planet X is very, very intriguing to me now.
[02:50:00.233 --> 02:50:00.774]  I love this.
[02:50:00.874 --> 02:50:02.596]  And I know that you have a clip, don't you, Bart?
[02:50:04.210 --> 02:50:04.571]  I do.
[02:50:05.231 --> 02:50:09.377]  By the way, you can get that book at Sibrel, S-I-B-R-E-L dot com.
[02:50:09.697 --> 02:50:18.208]  The clip you're about to see is from CNN, and they took it down off the internet, but one person actually filmed it off the TV on their cell phone.
[02:50:18.769 --> 02:50:20.411]  What has been happening in the last...
[02:50:20.951 --> 02:50:33.960]  Five or ten years is normally comets and asteroids are discovered decades in advance and for some strange reason as you've seen over and over again they'll say we just found one it's going to be nearby in three days.
[02:50:34.561 --> 02:50:36.202]  So why is that happening?
[02:50:36.642 --> 02:50:46.609]  Here is a report where CNN themselves admits that Planet X is true and it is the cause for these coming unpredictable comets and asteroids.
[02:50:47.363 --> 02:50:51.206]  There's a huge, hidden, heavenly body right here in our solar system.
[02:50:51.226 --> 02:51:00.994]  Evidence is mounting that either a brown dwarf star or a gas giant planet is lurking at the outermost reaches of our solar system, far beyond the planet Pluto.
[02:51:01.314 --> 02:51:05.377]  According to the British newspaper, The Independent, the object is four times the size of Jupiter.
[02:51:05.738 --> 02:51:11.482]  Experts say the presence of such a massive object could explain why a barrage of comets has been coming from that direction.
[02:51:14.705 --> 02:51:26.716]   And there's also, that's the end of the clip, Uh, there's also... Whenever you say CNN... Sorry about that.
[02:51:26.736 --> 02:51:30.337]  Whenever somebody says CNN, I have like a Pavlov reaction.
[02:51:30.377 --> 02:51:31.257]  I throw up a little bit.
[02:51:32.718 --> 02:51:37.299]  But the clip was interesting because it looks like they didn't really do more than that.
[02:51:37.379 --> 02:51:38.239]  That was about it, right?
[02:51:39.750 --> 02:51:41.011]  Yeah, well that's their Illuminati.
[02:51:41.031 --> 02:51:43.151]  We warned you one time, I guess, you know.
[02:51:43.732 --> 02:51:48.613]  And one thing you mentioned earlier was about people building bunkers and everything.
[02:51:49.054 --> 02:51:50.454]  You know, that's in the Bible too.
[02:51:50.534 --> 02:52:15.361]   It says in Revelation 6 15, And the kings of the earth and the great men, the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men, they hid themselves in dens and caves and mountains and says it right there that this is what they will be doing in the last day so something is going on the government's not gonna actually
[02:52:16.869 --> 02:52:36.773]  Okay, I have a thought about that, too, because I'd never really thought about this until reading your work, Bart, but the fact that they have to hide themselves up, you know, they could target HAARP, they can target certain... I'm losing my voice... they could target certain things, and they could actually bypass them by going to a different place, just like, you know, 9-11, when they didn't go into the towers, right?
[02:52:37.133 --> 02:52:45.797]   So they can be someplace else, and so if it hits the whole world, something that hits the entire world, They would not have control over.
[02:52:45.837 --> 02:52:46.998]  They would have to hide up.
[02:52:47.919 --> 02:52:48.179]  Right?
[02:52:48.379 --> 02:52:48.679]  All of them.
[02:52:49.620 --> 02:52:49.961]  Correct.
[02:52:50.001 --> 02:52:55.026]  That's, I think, why they're doing exactly what the Bible says the people will do in the last days.
[02:52:55.066 --> 02:53:03.895]  They will dig caves and holes and mountains to theoretically survive what is coming upon, and it says it again, the whole world.
[02:53:04.375 --> 02:53:19.420]   So what is coming, and Jesus warned us, it's signs in the Heavens, and that the stars will fall like ripe figs if Planet X does a loop around the sun, which my sources believe it will, that there's going to be two meteor storms.
[02:53:20.160 --> 02:53:23.441]  One as it comes in, and one that it goes out.
[02:53:23.521 --> 02:53:27.142]  And I remember another dream from like two years ago.
[02:53:27.762 --> 02:53:32.644]  I was shown a map of the solar system and a meteor storm heading toward Earth.
[02:53:33.374 --> 02:53:37.939]  And so even if none of those meteors struck the earth, right?
[02:53:38.319 --> 02:53:43.984]  Let's just say you went outside and all around the world for three days, it was non-stop fireworks at night.
[02:53:45.446 --> 02:53:58.733]   That would get people, that would wake them up because the Bible says That all these things that are happening are really to get our attention so that we have an opportunity, a motivation to repent before it's too late to do so.
[02:53:59.454 --> 02:54:15.935]   So Planet X I believe is God's sign and in a way it's symbolic of Lucifer because prior to 705 BC with every You know, with a year being 360 days, that means every month was exactly 30 days.
[02:54:16.015 --> 02:54:19.338]  Now, you couldn't argue against divine creation, could you?
[02:54:19.378 --> 02:54:24.223]  How could you say everything happened by chance when every month has exactly 30 days?
[02:54:24.643 --> 02:54:26.465]  There's 12 months, 12 tribes of Israel.
[02:54:26.785 --> 02:54:38.080]   So the devil, if you will, planet Lucifer, that the Vatican is tracking with their Lucifer telescope, destroyed God's testimony of divine creation.
[02:54:38.140 --> 02:54:38.960]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:54:39.320 --> 02:54:45.563]  And it's called a rogue planet, a rebeller who doesn't obey God's laws.
[02:54:47.484 --> 02:54:47.664]  Wow.
[02:54:48.311 --> 02:54:48.852]  Interesting.
[02:54:50.233 --> 02:54:53.957]  And there are some scriptures that say the entire heavens will be violently shaken.
[02:54:53.977 --> 02:54:58.362]  I'm not quite sure any amount of harp could probably carry that out.
[02:54:58.522 --> 02:55:01.405]  And so it is, you know, you really made me think.
[02:55:01.425 --> 02:55:03.648]  And I'm surprised because I'm serious.
[02:55:03.668 --> 02:55:05.870]  This is a topic that I just didn't give much thought to.
[02:55:05.890 --> 02:55:10.155]  I just thought it was like a scare tactic of something that we'll never see in our lifetime.
[02:55:10.595 --> 02:55:14.998]  But the more you talk about it and the things that you bring up, this is very interesting.
[02:55:15.078 --> 02:55:23.764]  Everybody needs to go to Sibrel.com and read up on this, S-I-B-R-E-L.com, because it is, it's fascinating to me to think about it in a different context.
[02:55:23.824 --> 02:55:34.351]  And if you could build something right now or have a place to go, say in the mountains, or take care of your family because you knew something like this was going to hit, this is the whole reason you're talking about it.
[02:55:34.371 --> 02:55:37.593]  It's the whole reason you're writing about it is because people need to be prepared.
[02:55:38.911 --> 02:55:48.027]  Yeah, I remember you asking me, hey, let's, you know, to tell you the truth, my surprise, you wanted to talk about Planet X instead of the moon landing fraud, which I'm known for.
[02:55:48.047 --> 02:55:49.089]  And then I started thinking.
[02:55:49.850 --> 02:55:55.593]  You know, I think you're right, because, okay, they counterfeited something, they murdered people, they've done that before.
[02:55:56.053 --> 02:56:09.301]  Planet X is a little bit more relevant, just like the guy at NASA told me so in 1989 when he said, yes, the moon landings are fake, but it's not as important as Planet X, because that is going to affect the whole world.
[02:56:10.143 --> 02:56:24.791]  If Planet X, a rogue planet, only comes close, let's say, between Jupiter and Saturn, which is some 600 million miles away, it will pull Jupiter further away from the Sun, which will pull the Earth further away from the Sun.
[02:56:24.972 --> 02:56:27.513]  Isaiah said the Earth will be moved out of its place.
[02:56:27.993 --> 02:56:30.815]  The orbit could even be elongated into an oval.
[02:56:31.593 --> 02:56:36.576]  Which would cause incredible climate change of severe winters and severe summers.
[02:56:36.656 --> 02:56:49.044]  Now, another thing I found interesting is that when they first invented the space shuttle, they were really optimistic they could launch that thing with, you know, having multiple ones and various progress twice a year.
[02:56:49.084 --> 02:56:52.906]  They ended up launching them sometimes four times a year for a decade or two.
[02:56:52.926 --> 02:56:56.048]  And I said to myself, you know, that's very dangerous.
[02:56:56.668 --> 02:56:57.729]  And very fast.
[02:56:57.829 --> 02:57:00.330]  They were in a hurry to build something.
[02:57:00.470 --> 02:57:06.474]  And then they go up and they claim it takes three days to triangulate the docking with the space station.
[02:57:06.774 --> 02:57:09.155]  Then the Soviets launch and they're there in 12 hours.
[02:57:09.175 --> 02:57:10.296]  And you know what the excuse was?
[02:57:10.596 --> 02:57:11.997]  Well, they have better math than we do.
[02:57:12.497 --> 02:57:15.959]  I think if 2 plus 2 equals 4 in America, it equals 4 in Russia.
[02:57:16.259 --> 02:57:18.280]  So what they're doing is something else.
[02:57:18.300 --> 02:57:19.941]  They have another space station.
[02:57:20.301 --> 02:57:21.322]  What is that all about?
[02:57:21.362 --> 02:57:24.684]  There's no way to stop a planet six times bigger than the Earth.
[02:57:25.444 --> 02:57:27.828]  But it will cause comets and asteroids.
[02:57:27.888 --> 02:57:33.578]  And I think maybe what they were building is something to zap those for Planet X approach.
[02:57:35.501 --> 02:57:35.662]  Wow.
[02:57:36.681 --> 02:57:37.181]  Interesting.
[02:57:37.201 --> 02:57:42.422]  I hope everybody's getting a lot of food for thought, especially your comments about prepping.
[02:57:42.462 --> 02:57:47.104]  We've been prepping a long time and probably this audience, I'm going to say, you're prepping out there.
[02:57:47.144 --> 02:57:48.464]  You're ordering extra, right?
[02:57:48.484 --> 02:57:50.865]  And maybe have it in a couple of places.
[02:57:51.045 --> 02:57:55.806]  Maybe have some place that you can go to that has your food storage too.
[02:57:55.846 --> 02:57:57.126]  Maybe divvy it up a little bit.
[02:57:57.146 --> 02:57:58.246]  There's all kinds of things.
[02:57:58.326 --> 02:58:02.728]   I know we only have about a minute and a half left, but There's so many things that maybe we could do.
[02:58:02.828 --> 02:58:06.969]  Maybe we can't bypass all of this coming, but maybe we can just prepare a little harder.
[02:58:06.989 --> 02:58:07.530]  I don't know.
[02:58:07.930 --> 02:58:08.410]  What do you think?
[02:58:08.730 --> 02:58:15.112]  Yeah, I think, and a lot of people, my wife hates the word tribulation supplies or preparing for the tribulation.
[02:58:15.152 --> 02:58:16.273]  She gets tired of hearing about it.
[02:58:16.773 --> 02:58:22.135]  One of the things she keeps reminding me of, and she's right, is that we need to be spiritually prepared.
[02:58:22.715 --> 02:58:24.719]  Because that's really more important.
[02:58:24.819 --> 02:58:29.466]  I mean, it is good if you want to ride it out and, you know, watch the show, have some supplies.
[02:58:29.526 --> 02:58:30.989]  But we need to repent.
[02:58:31.349 --> 02:58:37.298]  You know, Jesus said to believers, the love of most will grow cold in the last days.
[02:58:37.799 --> 02:58:41.401]  And only those who hold to the very end will be saved.
[02:58:41.521 --> 02:58:43.843]  Once saved, always saved is a false doctrine.
[02:58:43.903 --> 02:58:45.324]  It says so in Hebrews 10.
[02:58:45.944 --> 02:58:48.986]  If we deliberately go on sinning, no sacrifice for sin is left.
[02:58:49.306 --> 02:58:53.469]  So we have to continue to repent, continue to improve our character.
[02:58:54.264 --> 02:58:56.186]  In God's grace, we'll take care of the rest.
[02:58:56.266 --> 02:59:08.059]  And again, if your listeners want to see and read this, you know, article that took me hundreds of hours to write and research, just go to Sibrell.com and you'll find a complete article about Planet X.

[03:00:56.232 --> 03:01:02.473]  concentrate, Lomatium root concentrate, and so much more.

[03:01:16.389 --> 03:01:23.675]  The only way you fail, the only way you lose, is not supporting the broadcast while you get a product that supports your immune system.

[03:01:56.317 --> 03:02:06.401]  So, I want to encourage listeners to understand, if we hadn't sold 10,000 coins in December, the first part of the three-part series of the Liberty Coin, we would not be able to be operating right now.
[03:02:06.501 --> 03:02:08.481]  We need to sell all three of the series.
[03:02:08.501 --> 03:02:10.682]  The third is being minted right now here in America.
[03:02:10.702 --> 03:02:13.503]  The second is here in our warehouse shipping out today.
[03:02:13.603 --> 03:02:14.944]  It will sell out the next week.
[03:02:15.064 --> 03:02:16.184]  It's the Liberty Tree edition.
[03:02:16.264 --> 03:02:18.905]  The blood of patriots and tyrants must be shed for freedom.
[03:02:19.105 --> 03:02:25.092]  It is available at InfowarsStore.com right now or 1776coin.com.
[03:02:25.272 --> 03:02:33.762]  And if we are able to stay on air and if we stop nuclear war and all this, in the next few months we're planning to do some very special things, very special projects for just the members.
[03:02:33.822 --> 03:02:36.862]   that are part of this. That's why it's called a founding member coin. But regardless, you're
[03:02:36.862 --> 03:02:39.460]  keeping us on air. I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:02:39.460 --> 03:02:43.981]   Get your founding member, Liberty Tree, Thomas Jefferson coin. It is an amazing coin that I
[03:02:43.981 --> 03:02:48.281]   did the concept on, that a great designer created. And this is powerful. This is history.
[03:02:48.281 --> 03:02:52.551]   And this is your chance to have a memento of your support of liberty and freedom that sits in your
[03:02:52.551 --> 03:02:56.540]   pocket, on your mantel, on your desk, or wherever you want. And just to let you know that you
[03:02:56.540 --> 03:03:00.540]   kept us on air. As bad as things are, as crazy as things are, we can't give up right now.
