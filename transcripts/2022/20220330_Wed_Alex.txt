[00:00.000 --> 00:25.840]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:25.840 --> 00:30.520]  The young men and women who have volunteered to serve and protect their communities, as
[00:30.520 --> 00:35.640]  members of the United States military, have been under attack by their own government
[00:35.640 --> 00:43.440]  for over a century, experimented on like laboratory animals with mustard gas, plutonium, agent
[00:43.440 --> 00:46.640]  orange, and depleted uranium.
[00:46.640 --> 00:52.480]  But what we are experiencing now is the final destruction of the entire US military from
[00:52.480 --> 00:53.480]  within.
[00:53.480 --> 00:59.040]  Those with enough sense to refuse the gene therapy shots are being forced out of military
[00:59.040 --> 01:00.040]  service.
[01:00.040 --> 01:05.880]  Navy SEALs who refuse the jab have been denied deployment and even denied permission to travel
[01:05.880 --> 01:08.080]  for medical treatment.
[01:08.080 --> 01:13.480]  But more than two-thirds of the entire US military have chosen to receive this life-altering
[01:13.480 --> 01:18.760]  vaccine, which has now proven to be catastrophic.
[01:18.760 --> 01:25.600]  Attorney-at-law Todd Callender, who is representing the US Navy SEALs versus President Joe Biden,
[01:25.600 --> 01:33.320]  has recently reported an 1,100% increase in US military deaths as a result of these mRNA
[01:33.320 --> 01:35.120]  injections.
[01:35.120 --> 01:41.600]  And based on their latest data, they expect this number to soon rise above 5,000%.
[01:41.600 --> 01:46.880]  A leaked military database from the Department of Defense shows us that while the public
[01:46.880 --> 01:52.480]  was being told that it's a crisis of the unvaccinated, the Defense Secretary in upper
[01:52.480 --> 01:59.280]  command knew 71% of all new cases were among the fully vaccinated.
[01:59.280 --> 02:05.000]  The Department of Defense knew what they were doing, and the proper charges are genocide.
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.760]  If you look at all of the documentation, Pfizer's documentation, that we did mass spectrometry
[02:09.760 --> 02:14.360]  on their vials, we know what's in these things, and in fact they even admit that they added
[02:14.360 --> 02:20.560]  an HIV protein into the shots for the purpose of disabling people's autoimmune.
[02:20.560 --> 02:25.880]  They couldn't slip these lipid nanoparticles, which are in fact little bombers that carry
[02:25.880 --> 02:33.080]  pathogenic proteins to effectuate gene modification in the individual, gene therapies, they call
[02:33.080 --> 02:34.080]  it.
[02:34.080 --> 02:37.640]  In order to get those lipid nanoparticles past your cellular defense, your body's defense,
[02:37.640 --> 02:42.040]  they had to disarm your immune system, and they did that.
[02:42.040 --> 02:45.280]  It's in all the scientific papers, and what they didn't do is undo that, and right now
[02:45.280 --> 02:47.080]  they're coming to understand this.
[02:47.080 --> 02:52.120]  People showing up HIV positive, people with three shots have no immune system left over
[02:52.120 --> 02:53.120]  whatsoever.
[02:53.120 --> 02:57.120]  There is no other way to characterize this other than intentional homicide, the unlawful
[02:57.120 --> 03:02.160]  taking of the human life, except that it's in large numbers, which makes it a genocide.
[03:02.160 --> 03:05.600]  A vaccine-delivered AIDS epidemic.
[03:05.600 --> 03:06.600]  That's right.
[03:06.600 --> 03:07.600]  That's correct.
[03:07.600 --> 03:28.160]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[03:28.160 --> 03:34.120]  When you have U.S. senators in both parties saying, we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia
[03:34.120 --> 03:37.360]  first, and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before.
[03:37.360 --> 03:39.640]  What do you think that makes the Russians do?
[03:39.640 --> 03:42.240]  Well, it makes them go into war mode.
[03:42.240 --> 03:45.760]  So, I don't like them invading Ukraine.
[03:45.760 --> 03:49.680]  I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert.
[03:49.680 --> 03:53.600]  Only one level above that on their death con, just like our system, and that's fire the
[03:53.600 --> 03:54.600]  weapons.
[03:54.600 --> 04:00.880]  And so, now we have Democrats all over the news saying, let's just use nuclear weapons
[04:00.880 --> 04:01.880]  on Russia.
[04:01.880 --> 04:04.120]  Think of their interests.
[04:04.120 --> 04:08.920]  Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast with sea-launched missiles that would
[04:08.920 --> 04:14.480]  vaporize our cities within five minutes on average of being launched, sea-launched cruise
[04:14.480 --> 04:20.320]  missiles that fly at Mach 5, land-launched systems that can also launch from ships that
[04:20.320 --> 04:23.800]  are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down.
[04:23.800 --> 04:25.920]  And yes, the United States has those, too.
[04:25.920 --> 04:30.480]  That's a Pentagon lie that the Russia-developed system that we don't have.
[04:30.480 --> 04:32.680]  It's on record the U.S. has those systems.
[04:32.680 --> 04:39.160]  The point is, it's called mutually assured destruction or mad for a reason, because anyone
[04:39.160 --> 04:41.960]  that would violate the mad doctrine is insane.
[04:41.960 --> 04:46.640]  And you know, I'm on the side of not having a nuclear war, especially when Russia is not
[04:46.640 --> 04:50.280]  starting to fight with us, and especially after we just heard for years that everything
[04:50.280 --> 04:54.000]  happening in this country is run by Russia when that was all a giant lie.
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.520]  The globalists are the outside evil force.
[05:00.520 --> 05:08.800]  In December of 2021, InfoWars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 Anti-Tyrant
[05:08.800 --> 05:12.040]  Coin, and it sold out in 10 days.
[05:12.040 --> 05:16.600]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, a founding member
[05:16.600 --> 05:19.880]  coin, we would not be on air today.
[05:19.880 --> 05:25.360]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin, is being offered, and it will probably sell
[05:25.360 --> 05:27.440]  out in 10 days again.
[05:27.440 --> 05:29.920]  It certainly needs to be front of operation.
[05:29.920 --> 05:34.960]  It is so historic, and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty
[05:34.960 --> 05:38.840]  being refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants and more.
[05:38.840 --> 05:42.840]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[05:42.840 --> 05:45.080]  It's also at infowarstore.com.
[05:45.080 --> 05:46.080]  It's amazing.
[05:46.080 --> 05:47.840]  There's only 10,000 of them.
[05:47.840 --> 05:51.400]  And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air, we're planning something
[05:51.400 --> 05:55.880]  very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[05:55.880 --> 06:12.920]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[06:12.920 --> 06:21.200]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:21.200 --> 06:26.240]  Across the world, top scientists are confirming that individuals taking the Pfizer and Moderna
[06:26.240 --> 06:34.200]  shots are developing rapid onset of what can only be described as vaccine-induced HIV
[06:34.200 --> 06:35.200]  AIDS.
[06:35.200 --> 06:42.080]  Dr. Zelinka will be joining us as well as Armour Fullmick coming up in the second and
[06:42.080 --> 06:43.320]  third hours today.
[06:43.320 --> 06:45.080]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:45.080 --> 06:52.680]  But first, the world has awoken to the left's operating system, Satanism, pedophilia, and
[06:52.680 --> 07:01.960]  just all around destructiveness in their hunger for the innocence of our children.
[07:01.960 --> 07:06.520]  Disney and others have come out openly and said they want to brainwash five-year-olds
[07:06.520 --> 07:08.080]  into the creed of pedophilia.
[07:08.080 --> 07:12.040]  They want to destroy and literally rape their innocence, and they've attacked the wonderful
[07:12.040 --> 07:14.800]  governor, DeSantis.
[07:14.800 --> 07:19.560]  But here is this last year of the San Francisco, quote, gay choir saying, we're coming for
[07:19.560 --> 07:20.560]  your children.
[07:20.560 --> 07:21.560]  We're going to get them.
[07:21.560 --> 07:22.560]  We're going to groom them.
[07:22.560 --> 07:23.560]  They're ours.
[07:23.560 --> 07:24.560]  They belong to us.
[07:24.560 --> 07:25.560]  Here it is.
[07:25.560 --> 07:55.520]  We're going to convert your children, someone's got to teach them not to hate, we're coming
[07:55.520 --> 08:21.080]  for you.
[08:21.080 --> 08:28.080]  We can't get away from this here
[08:28.080 --> 08:30.080]  But you don't have to worry
[08:30.080 --> 08:33.080]  Because there's nothing wrong with standing by your side
[08:33.080 --> 08:36.080]  Can't avoid it or leave
[08:36.080 --> 08:38.080]  Because the world always needs something more bright
[08:38.080 --> 08:40.080]  No, you don't have to worry
[08:40.080 --> 08:43.080]  Cuz there's nothing wrong with standing by your side
[08:43.080 --> 08:45.080]  Because the world always needs something more bright
[08:45.080 --> 08:50.080]  Come on and try a little pride
[08:50.080 --> 08:52.080]  Children
[08:52.080 --> 08:54.080]  Then we'll turn to you
[08:54.080 --> 08:56.080]  Giving up the fear inside
[08:56.080 --> 08:59.080]  It's freeing like you never knew
[08:59.080 --> 09:02.080]  Go into San Francisco
[09:02.080 --> 09:04.080]  Go and turn up that disco
[09:04.080 --> 09:09.080]  You'll forget you were ever upset
[09:09.080 --> 09:12.080]  We'll convert your children
[09:12.080 --> 09:25.080]  And make it how I love you now
[09:25.080 --> 09:29.080]  This is what war looks like in the year 2022
[09:29.080 --> 09:31.080]  They're coming for your energy
[09:31.080 --> 09:33.080]  They're coming for your right to self-defense
[09:33.080 --> 09:35.080]  They're coming for your housing
[09:35.080 --> 09:36.080]  They're coming for your children
[09:36.080 --> 09:38.080]  They're coming for your currency
[09:38.080 --> 09:44.080]  They're coming for your soul
[09:44.080 --> 09:45.080]  Oh, don't hate us
[09:45.080 --> 09:46.080]  Let us have gay marriage
[09:46.080 --> 09:48.080]  And then, boom, we're coming for your children
[09:48.080 --> 09:49.080]  Your children belong to us
[09:49.080 --> 09:52.080]  And now, I was watching some of this last night
[09:52.080 --> 09:53.080]  And I just couldn't watch it
[09:53.080 --> 09:55.080]  After I put my four-and-a-half-year-old daughter to bed
[09:55.080 --> 09:56.080]  She's such a little sweetheart
[09:56.080 --> 09:58.080]  And so innocent and good
[09:58.080 --> 10:01.080]  It must be protected and will be
[10:01.080 --> 10:04.080]  I went and watched some of the Disney executive videos
[10:04.080 --> 10:06.080]  We're on infowars.com
[10:06.080 --> 10:08.080]  Where the executives got together
[10:08.080 --> 10:09.080]  And they're like, we're going to get them
[10:09.080 --> 10:11.080]  The children must be ours
[10:11.080 --> 10:13.080]  We must queer them at age five
[10:13.080 --> 10:15.080]  These are quotes
[10:15.080 --> 10:17.080]  You imagine if you were a park
[10:17.080 --> 10:19.080]  And there's a park bench over here
[10:19.080 --> 10:21.080]  And some tables and a barbecue pit
[10:21.080 --> 10:22.080]  And there's a family over there
[10:22.080 --> 10:23.080]  And you got your family
[10:23.080 --> 10:25.080]  You're throwing the football back and forth
[10:25.080 --> 10:27.080]  And then just a couple dudes walk up
[10:27.080 --> 10:28.080]  A couple women and they walk over
[10:28.080 --> 10:30.080]  And say, hi, we'd like to talk to your
[10:30.080 --> 10:32.080]  Five-year-old daughter and your six-year-old son
[10:32.080 --> 10:35.080]  About sex and how they feel about that
[10:35.080 --> 10:37.080]  We want to have a party with them
[10:37.080 --> 10:38.080]  And have them wear rainbow flags and dance
[10:38.080 --> 10:40.080]  And paint their nails and teach them
[10:40.080 --> 10:42.080]  About having sex with the same sex
[10:42.080 --> 10:43.080]  You're ruining their innocence
[10:43.080 --> 10:45.080]  That's not what goes on
[10:45.080 --> 10:48.080]  And that's a stranger doing it
[10:48.080 --> 10:50.080]  But now it's the schools going and getting the
[10:50.080 --> 10:52.080]  Nerds and the autistic and the low-hanging fruit
[10:52.080 --> 10:54.080]  And then moving on with the rest of the children
[10:54.080 --> 10:55.080]  And destroying their innocence
[10:55.080 --> 10:57.080]  And then saying in that choir song
[10:57.080 --> 10:59.080]  And all the big statements at city councils
[10:59.080 --> 11:01.080]  And at Disney events
[11:01.080 --> 11:03.080]  We're going to get your children
[11:03.080 --> 11:05.080]  And then we're going to get you
[11:05.080 --> 11:09.080]  They just busted over 130 Disney employees
[11:09.080 --> 11:12.080]  In Orlando alone for child sex rings
[11:12.080 --> 11:14.080]  They just busted the highest-ranking
[11:14.080 --> 11:16.080]  Civilian in the Pentagon
[11:16.080 --> 11:18.080]  In Afghanistan, it's come out
[11:18.080 --> 11:20.080]  It's been suppressed, it's mainstream news
[11:20.080 --> 11:24.080]  Running child rape rings and porn rings
[11:24.080 --> 11:26.080]  Child porn rings
[11:26.080 --> 11:28.080]  I have stacks today
[11:28.080 --> 11:30.080]  Of government-run facilities
[11:30.080 --> 11:32.080]  Raping children as young as five
[11:32.080 --> 11:34.080]  Mainstream German news reporting
[11:34.080 --> 11:36.080]  Tens of thousands of children per city
[11:36.080 --> 11:39.080]  CIA run with the psychiatry department
[11:39.080 --> 11:41.080]  Of the CPS, taking Christians' children
[11:41.080 --> 11:44.080]  And giving them to rape rings
[11:44.080 --> 11:46.080]  You cannot make up the full magnitude
[11:46.080 --> 11:48.080]  Of this, and then DeSantis
[11:48.080 --> 11:50.080]  Hauls out the demon in the room
[11:50.080 --> 11:51.080]  The elephant in the room
[11:51.080 --> 11:53.080]  The 80 trillion pound Satan
[11:53.080 --> 11:57.080]  And says, in the bill I've got right here
[11:57.080 --> 11:59.080]  You will not talk to children five to eight
[11:59.080 --> 12:01.080]  About sex, period, they can't understand it
[12:01.080 --> 12:05.080]  It should be five to, like, 15
[12:05.080 --> 12:07.080]  And they have all these people threatening him
[12:07.080 --> 12:08.080]  And threatening to kill him
[12:08.080 --> 12:11.080]  And all these Hollywood scum that look like pedophiles
[12:11.080 --> 12:13.080]  I'm not saying the guys clip are going to play
[12:13.080 --> 12:14.080]  That he is a pedophile
[12:14.080 --> 12:16.080]  He's called for assaulting me and things
[12:16.080 --> 12:19.080]  He also plays Hellboy, the son of Satan
[12:19.080 --> 12:21.080]  Or whatever, as a movie theater person
[12:21.080 --> 12:23.080]  But he's so gross and disgusting
[12:23.080 --> 12:26.080]  And this is Hollywood as it falls and implodes
[12:26.080 --> 12:29.080]  Trying to claw our children down with it into hell
[12:29.080 --> 12:32.080]  I've got the damn bill
[12:32.080 --> 12:35.080]  Right here, ladies and gentlemen
[12:35.080 --> 12:37.080]  Yeah, what's this guy's name, Ron Perlman?
[12:37.080 --> 12:40.080]  Go ahead and play what this maggot has to say
[12:40.080 --> 12:42.080]  And by the way, lying
[12:42.080 --> 12:45.080]  Oh, he says they're attacking gay people
[12:45.080 --> 12:48.080]  No, you're not going to teach five-year-olds
[12:48.080 --> 12:51.080]  With the teacher about their genitals
[12:51.080 --> 12:54.080]  And about how you can have sex with the same sex
[12:54.080 --> 12:57.080]  I don't want same-sex, different...
[12:57.080 --> 12:59.080]  Heterosexual, homosexual, it's called
[12:59.080 --> 13:02.080]  Pedophilia Hellboy
[13:02.080 --> 13:04.080]  And you're the one that's going to get hell
[13:04.080 --> 13:06.080]  You're not going to get our children
[13:06.080 --> 13:08.080]  We're going to stand up, we're going to take society back
[13:08.080 --> 13:10.080]  Here he is
[13:10.080 --> 13:12.080]  Good morning, Governor DeSantis
[13:12.080 --> 13:15.080]  Ron here
[13:15.080 --> 13:18.080]  Super creepy
[13:18.080 --> 13:20.080]  Don't say gay
[13:20.080 --> 13:21.080]  Ugh
[13:21.080 --> 13:23.080]  Don't say
[13:23.080 --> 13:25.080]  As the first two words
[13:25.080 --> 13:28.080]  In a sentence spoken by a political leader
[13:28.080 --> 13:29.080]  Of a state
[13:29.080 --> 13:30.080]  Ugh
[13:30.080 --> 13:32.080]  In the United States of America
[13:32.080 --> 13:34.080]  Don't say
[13:34.080 --> 13:36.080]  Don't f***ing say
[13:36.080 --> 13:38.080]  You f***ing Nazi pig
[13:38.080 --> 13:41.080]  Say
[13:41.080 --> 13:44.080]  First amendment
[13:44.080 --> 13:46.080]  Read about it
[13:46.080 --> 13:49.080]  Then run for office
[13:49.080 --> 13:52.080]  You piece of s***
[13:52.080 --> 13:55.080]  Good morning, Governor DeSantis
[13:55.080 --> 13:57.080]  Alright, so
[13:57.080 --> 14:01.080]  Ladies and gentlemen
[14:01.080 --> 14:03.080]  Number one, he's a lying devil
[14:03.080 --> 14:05.080]  Who actually plays the devil in movies
[14:05.080 --> 14:09.080]  He's so ugly and disgusting
[14:09.080 --> 14:14.080]  But the bill does not say the word gay
[14:14.080 --> 14:19.080]  A stolen word meaning happy and free
[14:19.080 --> 14:21.080]  Just like the rainbow didn't belong to these people
[14:21.080 --> 14:25.080]  And the word gated
[14:25.080 --> 14:27.080]  And now, oh, you don't hate two men together
[14:27.080 --> 14:29.080]  Do you? You don't hate two women together?
[14:29.080 --> 14:31.080]  No, I'm a free, free, free spirit
[14:31.080 --> 14:33.080]  I don't hate anybody as long as they're adults
[14:33.080 --> 14:35.080]  And now it's like, hey, you don't mind if we
[14:35.080 --> 14:37.080]  Have a conversation with your children
[14:37.080 --> 14:39.080]  You don't mind if we talk about who they are
[14:39.080 --> 14:42.080]  And then designate them as some new designation
[14:42.080 --> 14:44.080]  And take your parental rights away, do you?
[14:44.080 --> 14:46.080]  Well, hell yeah, I do
[14:46.080 --> 14:48.080]  You don't mind as a biological man
[14:48.080 --> 14:50.080]  Comes in this women's bathroom
[14:50.080 --> 14:52.080]  And gets in the showers with women
[14:52.080 --> 14:56.080]  From Austin, Texas to San Francisco to New York City
[14:56.080 --> 14:58.080]  Women won't even go to a lot of the salons
[14:58.080 --> 15:00.080]  And a lot of the spas now
[15:00.080 --> 15:02.080]  Because you'll be in them routinely
[15:02.080 --> 15:04.080]  And a dude comes in with his genitals
[15:04.080 --> 15:08.080]  Flapping around
[15:08.080 --> 15:10.080]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen
[15:10.080 --> 15:13.080]  Unbelievable raping of our rights
[15:13.080 --> 15:15.080]  Raping of our psyche
[15:15.080 --> 15:17.080]  And they're just getting started
[15:17.080 --> 15:20.080]  That big, old, gross, creepy
[15:20.080 --> 15:24.080]  Ron Perlman
[15:24.080 --> 15:27.080]  And his threats and just how gross he is
[15:27.080 --> 15:28.080]  I'm gonna say it
[15:28.080 --> 15:31.080]  I'm not saying Ron Perlman is a pedophile
[15:31.080 --> 15:35.080]  He is supporting the sexualization of children
[15:35.080 --> 15:41.080]  And he looks like
[15:41.080 --> 15:44.080]  Somebody that would be a pedophile
[15:44.080 --> 15:46.080]  Like Brian Stultz
[15:46.080 --> 15:47.080]  I would cast people
[15:47.080 --> 15:48.080]  Again, like a couple guys
[15:48.080 --> 15:49.080]  Drive around a white van
[15:49.080 --> 15:50.080]  Kidnapping kids around the country
[15:50.080 --> 15:51.080]  And raping them and killing them
[15:51.080 --> 15:53.080]  I would cast Ron Perlman
[15:53.080 --> 15:55.080]  And Brian Stelzer
[15:55.080 --> 16:19.080]  As evil and eviler in the new movie
[16:26.080 --> 16:27.080]  It certainly needs to
[16:27.080 --> 16:28.080]  The front of operation
[16:28.080 --> 16:30.080]  It is so historic
[16:30.080 --> 16:32.080]  And it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson
[16:32.080 --> 16:34.080]  About the Tree of Liberty being refreshed
[16:34.080 --> 16:36.080]  With the blood of Patriots and Tyrants
[16:36.080 --> 16:37.080]  And more
[16:37.080 --> 16:38.080]  See the coin for yourself
[16:38.080 --> 16:41.080]  At 1776coin.com
[16:41.080 --> 16:43.080]  It's also at infowarstore.com
[16:43.080 --> 16:44.080]  It's amazing
[16:44.080 --> 16:46.080]  There's only 10,000 of them
[16:46.080 --> 16:47.080]  And as a founding member
[16:47.080 --> 16:49.080]  And we're able to stay on the air
[16:49.080 --> 16:52.080]  We're planning something very, very special
[16:52.080 --> 16:54.080]  For everyone that helps us go to the next level
[16:54.080 --> 16:56.080]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin
[16:56.080 --> 16:57.080]  While you still can
[16:57.080 --> 16:59.080]  At 1776coin.com
[16:59.080 --> 17:01.080]  Ladies and gentlemen
[17:01.080 --> 17:05.080]  Infowarsstore.com is offering the biggest sales
[17:05.080 --> 17:08.080]  In its over 20-year history
[17:08.080 --> 17:10.080]  And that is because
[17:10.080 --> 17:11.080]  The economy is breaking down
[17:11.080 --> 17:13.080]  Inflation is exploding
[17:13.080 --> 17:15.080]  The supply chains have broken down
[17:15.080 --> 17:18.080]  And Infowars is having serious trouble
[17:18.080 --> 17:19.080]  Making its payroll
[17:19.080 --> 17:20.080]  And paying for operations
[17:20.080 --> 17:23.080]  And I do not want to implode or downsize
[17:23.080 --> 17:24.080]  In the face of the globalists
[17:24.080 --> 17:25.080]  Making their main move
[17:25.080 --> 17:27.080]  Infowars, it's paradoxical
[17:27.080 --> 17:29.080]  It's more popular than ever
[17:29.080 --> 17:30.080]  It's reaching more people than ever
[17:30.080 --> 17:31.080]  Despite the censorship
[17:31.080 --> 17:33.080]  But because of cost increasing
[17:33.080 --> 17:35.080]  And having to run our own infrastructure
[17:35.080 --> 17:36.080]  And pay for our own bandwidth
[17:36.080 --> 17:37.080]  Everything else
[17:37.080 --> 17:39.080]  We are running out of money
[17:39.080 --> 17:40.080]  So listen
[17:40.080 --> 17:43.080]  Up to 75% off at infowarsstore.com
[17:43.080 --> 17:44.080]  On things like amazing

[17:47.080 --> 17:48.080]  And fund the operation
[17:48.080 --> 17:51.080]  On supplements, on books, on films
[17:51.080 --> 17:54.080]  Everything is 25-75% off right now
[17:54.080 --> 17:55.080]  The biggest sale in our history
[17:55.080 --> 17:57.080]  At infowarsstore.com
[17:57.080 --> 18:26.080]  Thank you for your support
[18:27.080 --> 18:28.080]  Thank you
[18:58.080 --> 19:01.080]  We here at Infowars are proud to announce
[19:01.080 --> 19:04.080]  The first ever Kava Kava root supplement
[19:04.080 --> 19:07.080]  That is now available at infowarsstore.com
[19:07.080 --> 19:10.080]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs
[19:10.080 --> 19:12.080]  In the natural health world today
[19:12.080 --> 19:14.080]  Though it has been used for hundreds of years
[19:14.080 --> 19:15.080]  In the Pacific islands
[19:15.080 --> 19:18.080]  For its relaxation and euphoric effects
[19:18.080 --> 19:20.080]  According to ancient Samoan legend
[19:20.080 --> 19:22.080]  Kava was given as a gift
[19:22.080 --> 19:24.080]  By the sun god Tagaloa
[19:24.080 --> 19:26.080]  Who they considered to be the supreme ruler
[19:26.080 --> 19:28.080]  And creator of the universe
[19:28.080 --> 19:30.080]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea
[19:30.080 --> 19:33.080]  During social gatherings and sacred ceremonies
[19:33.080 --> 19:34.080]  To loosen up a little
[19:34.080 --> 19:36.080]  Nowadays Kava is used around the world
[19:36.080 --> 19:39.080]  By many who enjoy its serious benefits
[19:39.080 --> 19:41.080]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals
[19:41.080 --> 19:43.080]  Contains a full blend of
[19:43.080 --> 19:44.080]  Not only Kava Kava
[19:44.080 --> 19:46.080]  But other herbs including
[19:46.080 --> 19:47.080]  But not limited to
[19:47.080 --> 19:48.080]  German Kama Mill
[19:48.080 --> 19:50.080]  Organic Skoll Cap
[19:50.080 --> 19:51.080]  And Balerian root
[19:51.080 --> 19:54.080]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly
[19:54.080 --> 19:56.080]  So be sure to secure yours
[19:56.080 --> 19:59.080]  By visiting infowarsstore.com
[20:00.080 --> 20:02.080]  Leading a frontal assault
[20:02.080 --> 20:05.080]  On the lies of the New World Order
[20:05.080 --> 20:07.080]  It's Alex Jones
[20:13.080 --> 20:16.080]  MTG is coming up next segment with big news
[20:16.080 --> 20:19.080]  Concerning the Pito rings being out in the open
[20:19.080 --> 20:20.080]  It's Wednesday live
[20:20.080 --> 20:23.080]  The world has awakened to the horrible fact
[20:23.080 --> 20:25.080]  That the left's operating system is pedophilia
[20:25.080 --> 20:27.080]  Satanism and death
[20:27.080 --> 20:28.080]  They hate children
[20:28.080 --> 20:29.080]  And want to steal their future
[20:29.080 --> 20:30.080]  Steal their souls
[20:30.080 --> 20:31.080]  Steal their innocence
[20:31.080 --> 20:32.080]  And in many cases kill them
[20:32.080 --> 20:34.080]  And they also use tragic deaths of children
[20:34.080 --> 20:35.080]  To blame all of us
[20:35.080 --> 20:37.080]  And try to take our guns and free speech
[20:37.080 --> 20:41.080]  But we won't let those dirty Pito-Fall rings win
[20:41.080 --> 20:43.080]  Because the truth is coming out
[20:43.080 --> 20:45.080]  And their hunger for the innocence of children
[20:45.080 --> 20:46.080]  Cannot be contained
[20:46.080 --> 20:48.080]  And so they're going to show themselves
[20:48.080 --> 20:49.080]  That's why we're going to win
[20:49.080 --> 20:50.080]  They're showing themselves now
[20:50.080 --> 20:52.080]  About to get back to this huge development
[20:52.080 --> 20:53.080]  As the world awakens
[20:53.080 --> 20:55.080]  But first, I want to thank the listeners
[20:55.080 --> 20:58.080]  That have gone to 1776coin.com
[20:58.080 --> 20:59.080]  And I want to thank those of you
[20:59.080 --> 21:00.080]  That got the first George Washington
[21:00.080 --> 21:02.080]  Slaying the Dragon coin
[21:02.080 --> 21:03.080]  And now we have the Tree of Liberty coin
[21:03.080 --> 21:04.080]  There'll be one other coin
[21:04.080 --> 21:05.080]  That'll be announced in a few months
[21:05.080 --> 21:07.080]  And that's it for founding member coins
[21:07.080 --> 21:09.080]  And if we're able to stay on air
[21:09.080 --> 21:11.080]  And keep operating, which we are
[21:11.080 --> 21:12.080]  You know, thanks to you
[21:12.080 --> 21:14.080]  That everybody that becomes a founding member
[21:14.080 --> 21:18.080]  Will get all sorts of exclusive content
[21:18.080 --> 21:20.080]  Special things we're going to do
[21:20.080 --> 21:22.080]  So much I've got planned
[21:22.080 --> 21:23.080]  It's going to be huge
[21:23.080 --> 21:25.080]  We're three or four months behind
[21:25.080 --> 21:26.080]  Everything we're doing
[21:26.080 --> 21:27.080]  Is the fights that are going on
[21:27.080 --> 21:29.080]  But it's all in line to happen
[21:29.080 --> 21:30.080]  And we're very, very close
[21:30.080 --> 21:32.080]  By the time we've sold these three coins
[21:32.080 --> 21:33.080]  It'll really help capitalize
[21:33.080 --> 21:35.080]  Major new stuff with seed money
[21:35.080 --> 21:36.080]  To launch some incredible things
[21:36.080 --> 21:39.080]  So the coin, we've already sold out
[21:39.080 --> 21:41.080]  Of close to 40% of them
[21:41.080 --> 21:42.080]  And so that means it's following
[21:42.080 --> 21:44.080]  The exact same trend that last time
[21:44.080 --> 21:46.080]  Where it'll be sold out by the end of next week
[21:46.080 --> 21:47.080]  If not sooner
[21:47.080 --> 21:48.080]  And we held back 300 coins
[21:48.080 --> 21:50.080]  And we just put those up last night
[21:50.080 --> 21:52.080]  The last coin and they sold out
[21:52.080 --> 21:53.080]  In a matter of hours
[21:53.080 --> 21:55.080]  We're out of the George Washington coin
[21:55.080 --> 21:56.080]  Except for 50
[21:56.080 --> 21:57.080]  I held back for myself
[21:57.080 --> 21:58.080]  To give friends and family
[21:58.080 --> 21:59.080]  Only 50 of those now left
[21:59.080 --> 22:00.080]  And they're not for sale
[22:00.080 --> 22:03.080]  There are only 6,000
[22:03.080 --> 22:05.080]  Of the Tree of Liberty coin available
[22:05.080 --> 22:07.080]  I designed it with a top coin designer
[22:07.080 --> 22:09.080]  But it's my art
[22:09.080 --> 22:11.080]  And this is huge, ladies and gentlemen
[22:11.080 --> 22:13.080]  And this is art-typed
[22:13.080 --> 22:14.080]  To have this in your pocket
[22:14.080 --> 22:16.080]  Or on your mantle
[22:16.080 --> 22:17.080]  That you are funding
[22:17.080 --> 22:18.080]  In the tip of the spear
[22:18.080 --> 22:19.080]  Against these demons
[22:19.080 --> 22:20.080]  I want to thank you
[22:20.080 --> 22:21.080]  For giving us aid and comfort
[22:21.080 --> 22:22.080]  In the fight against the New World Order
[22:22.080 --> 22:23.080]  And I want to encourage those
[22:23.080 --> 22:26.080]  That have not gone to 1776coin.com
[22:26.080 --> 22:27.080]  To get yours now
[22:27.080 --> 22:28.080]  While you still can
[22:28.080 --> 22:30.080]  1776coin.com
[22:30.080 --> 22:31.080]  Or right on the front page
[22:31.080 --> 22:32.080]  Of m4warstore.com
[22:32.080 --> 22:33.080]  You'll see a big link
[22:33.080 --> 22:34.080]  That takes you to the new
[22:34.080 --> 22:36.080]  Patreon at collectibles.com website
[22:36.080 --> 22:37.080]  Which again is going to have
[22:37.080 --> 22:38.080]  A lot of exclusive stuff
[22:38.080 --> 22:40.080]  A lot of really amazing stuff
[22:40.080 --> 22:42.080]  And things that also have very low prices
[22:42.080 --> 22:44.080]  But it takes money to build
[22:44.080 --> 22:46.080]  The infrastructure of something like this
[22:46.080 --> 22:48.080]  That will then fund the next level
[22:48.080 --> 22:49.080]  Of the info war
[22:49.080 --> 22:50.080]  I'm going to leave it at that
[22:50.080 --> 22:51.080]  Not give out strategy
[22:51.080 --> 22:52.080]  But this is how the founders
[22:52.080 --> 22:54.080]  Funded the Revolutionary War
[22:54.080 --> 22:56.080]  Those were especially minted coins
[22:56.080 --> 22:57.080]  That were copper actually
[22:57.080 --> 22:58.080]  And pewter
[22:58.080 --> 22:59.080]  But people knew
[22:59.080 --> 23:01.080]  That they'd been part of donating
[23:01.080 --> 23:02.080]  Large sums in many cases
[23:02.080 --> 23:04.080]  And little American flags
[23:04.080 --> 23:05.080]  Benjamin Franklin
[23:05.080 --> 23:06.080]  And Thomas Jefferson
[23:06.080 --> 23:08.080]  Went on a ship during the war
[23:08.080 --> 23:09.080]  To France
[23:09.080 --> 23:11.080]  Spent several years there
[23:11.080 --> 23:12.080]  Just raising money
[23:12.080 --> 23:13.080]  And they were printing
[23:13.080 --> 23:16.080]  Little American flags
[23:16.080 --> 23:19.080]  Six by a foot
[23:19.080 --> 23:20.080]  Or smaller
[23:20.080 --> 23:22.080]  And that's how they funded
[23:22.080 --> 23:23.080]  About a third of the revolution
[23:23.080 --> 23:24.080]  Was trinkets
[23:24.080 --> 23:26.080]  Well, this isn't pewter
[23:26.080 --> 23:27.080]  This isn't
[23:27.080 --> 23:29.080]  By the way, those are very valuable today
[23:29.080 --> 23:30.080]  This isn't brass
[23:30.080 --> 23:31.080]  This isn't copper
[23:31.080 --> 23:33.080]  Some of those coins go for millions
[23:33.080 --> 23:34.080]  By the way, today
[23:34.080 --> 23:35.080]  From that era
[23:35.080 --> 23:36.080]  In France
[23:36.080 --> 23:37.080]  And the US being sold
[23:37.080 --> 23:38.080]  This is pure silver
[23:38.080 --> 23:40.080]  So this is not a trinket
[23:40.080 --> 23:41.080]  It wouldn't matter though
[23:41.080 --> 23:42.080]  If all we have is an American flag
[23:42.080 --> 23:43.080]  And I said hey
[23:43.080 --> 23:44.080]  We got a thousand of these funders
[23:44.080 --> 23:45.080]  Please be part of that
[23:45.080 --> 23:46.080]  It'd be history
[23:46.080 --> 23:47.080]  But this is awesome
[23:47.080 --> 23:48.080]  And I got this
[23:48.080 --> 23:51.080]  Just remembering the founders
[23:51.080 --> 23:53.080]  And I was watching a couple years ago
[23:53.080 --> 23:54.080]  I'm digressing
[23:54.080 --> 23:57.080]  Until you get back to the news
[23:57.080 --> 23:58.080]  What was that TV show?
[23:58.080 --> 24:00.080]  It was about John Adams
[24:00.080 --> 24:02.080]  And it had a scene in there
[24:02.080 --> 24:03.080]  Where they were selling
[24:03.080 --> 24:04.080]  Little American flags
[24:04.080 --> 24:05.080]  And trinkets
[24:05.080 --> 24:07.080]  And little copper coins
[24:07.080 --> 24:09.080]  To then give me ten times
[24:09.080 --> 24:10.080]  Well, this is worth back
[24:10.080 --> 24:11.080]  For this piece of history
[24:11.080 --> 24:12.080]  And of course the French couldn't
[24:12.080 --> 24:13.080]  Grab them up quick enough
[24:13.080 --> 24:14.080]  Because they understood
[24:14.080 --> 24:15.080]  They were financing a revolution
[24:15.080 --> 24:16.080]  Against their arch enemy
[24:16.080 --> 24:18.080]  Well, you're definitely financing
[24:18.080 --> 24:20.080]  A revolution against humanity's enemy
[24:20.080 --> 24:21.080]  Here, baby
[24:21.080 --> 24:22.080]  I mean, King George III
[24:22.080 --> 24:24.080]  Was an angel compared to these people
[24:24.080 --> 24:26.080]  So we need war bonds
[24:26.080 --> 24:28.080]  We need money to fight this damn war
[24:28.080 --> 24:30.080]  In FullWarStore.com
[24:30.080 --> 24:31.080]  Right now, as the link
[24:31.080 --> 24:32.080]  To patreoncollectibles.com
[24:32.080 --> 24:34.080]  Please take action, ladies and gentlemen
[24:34.080 --> 24:35.080]  And I thank those that have
[24:35.080 --> 24:37.080]  And I thank those that will
[24:37.080 --> 24:40.080]  Okay, I've gone from lacking to
[24:40.080 --> 24:42.080]  Sanis to loving to Sanis
[24:42.080 --> 24:44.080]  To my instincts have told me he's good
[24:44.080 --> 24:46.080]  And now he's got my full backing
[24:46.080 --> 24:48.080]  He's the real deal
[24:48.080 --> 24:50.080]  He's better than Trump
[24:50.080 --> 24:52.080]  I'm not trying to pick favorites here
[24:52.080 --> 24:53.080]  I want Trump to get jealous
[24:53.080 --> 24:55.080]  And become more like DeSantis
[24:55.080 --> 24:57.080]  We all need to be more like DeSantis
[24:57.080 --> 24:58.080]  He's a gentleman
[24:58.080 --> 24:59.080]  He's smart
[24:59.080 --> 25:00.080]  He's a family man
[25:00.080 --> 25:01.080]  He's a patriot
[25:01.080 --> 25:02.080]  He's a veteran
[25:02.080 --> 25:04.080]  He is our leader
[25:04.080 --> 25:05.080]  I mean, if you've got to know about
[25:05.080 --> 25:06.080]  Who's leading the fight
[25:06.080 --> 25:07.080]  Against the New World Order
[25:07.080 --> 25:08.080]  It's Tucker Carlson
[25:08.080 --> 25:09.080]  And it's DeSantis
[25:09.080 --> 25:10.080]  Men that are gentlemen
[25:10.080 --> 25:12.080]  That really care about everybody
[25:12.080 --> 25:14.080]  That I would say are the best examples
[25:14.080 --> 25:15.080]  Of leadership in America
[25:15.080 --> 25:17.080]  It's DeSantis and Tucker Carlson
[25:17.080 --> 25:19.080]  I'm obviously the shock trooper
[25:19.080 --> 25:21.080]  That, you know, is the crack in your release
[25:21.080 --> 25:23.080]  And I'm proud to be that
[25:23.080 --> 25:25.080]  But I can tell you that
[25:25.080 --> 25:27.080]  That my job has been to expose this
[25:27.080 --> 25:28.080]  And bring in the men
[25:28.080 --> 25:30.080]  And bring in the women
[25:30.080 --> 25:32.080]  I use kind of a John the Baptist analogy
[25:32.080 --> 25:33.080]  God told me that
[25:33.080 --> 25:35.080]  God's like, you are going to launch the attack
[25:35.080 --> 25:38.080]  You are going to prepare the ground
[25:38.080 --> 25:39.080]  Your people are going to prepare the ground
[25:39.080 --> 25:41.080]  And then you watch the leaders will rise
[25:41.080 --> 25:42.080]  And we're seeing that
[25:42.080 --> 25:44.080]  And all of us are rising, ladies and gentlemen
[25:44.080 --> 25:46.080]  But I just give credit where it's due
[25:46.080 --> 25:48.080]  It's people like DeSantis
[25:48.080 --> 25:49.080]  And people like Tucker Carlson
[25:49.080 --> 25:51.080]  I've almost got Rogan
[25:51.080 --> 25:52.080]  Super hardcore
[25:52.080 --> 25:53.080]  He's almost there
[25:53.080 --> 25:55.080]  You know, he gets super hardcore
[25:55.080 --> 25:57.080]  And then he kind of goes back a little
[25:57.080 --> 26:00.080]  But I've just got to spend more time with him
[26:00.080 --> 26:01.080]  I love Joe
[26:01.080 --> 26:02.080]  He can hang out anytime I want
[26:02.080 --> 26:03.080]  He can hang out anytime I call him
[26:03.080 --> 26:04.080]  Yeah, let's go get dinner
[26:04.080 --> 26:05.080]  Sometimes we hang out like twice a week
[26:05.080 --> 26:06.080]  I just, you know
[26:06.080 --> 26:08.080]  Joe is really such a sweetheart
[26:08.080 --> 26:10.080]  But he doesn't want to be in the middle of the fight
[26:10.080 --> 26:12.080]  Not because he's a coward
[26:12.080 --> 26:14.080]  He's almost embarrassed to be that deep in the fight
[26:14.080 --> 26:15.080]  And it's just like me
[26:15.080 --> 26:16.080]  A talk show host
[26:16.080 --> 26:17.080]  A karate guy
[26:17.080 --> 26:19.080]  A UFC commentator
[26:19.080 --> 26:20.080]  Well, you know what?
[26:20.080 --> 26:21.080]  If you tell the truth, Joe
[26:21.080 --> 26:22.080]  It makes you the leader
[26:22.080 --> 26:24.080]  So that's all I'm looking for
[26:24.080 --> 26:25.080]  Here's leadership
[26:25.080 --> 26:26.080]  And that's what we got right now
[26:26.080 --> 26:28.080]  Ian DeSantis
[26:28.080 --> 26:29.080]  Here he is throwing on a gauntlet
[26:29.080 --> 26:33.080]  Telling the pedo folks over to Disney
[26:33.080 --> 26:34.080]  Which, by the way,
[26:34.080 --> 26:36.080]  The long history of pedophilia over at Disney
[26:36.080 --> 26:37.080]  Hiring convicted pedophiles
[26:37.080 --> 26:38.080]  You name it
[26:38.080 --> 26:39.080]  Tell them he didn't give a damn
[26:39.080 --> 26:41.080]  About what they say
[26:41.080 --> 26:42.080]  This is the attitude
[26:42.080 --> 26:43.080]  We're done with you
[26:43.080 --> 26:44.080]  We're not bullied by you
[26:44.080 --> 26:45.080]  We're breaking with you now
[26:45.080 --> 26:46.080]  You can't have our children
[26:46.080 --> 26:48.080]  You devil-worshiping pedophiles
[26:48.080 --> 26:50.080]  Here he is
[26:50.080 --> 26:52.080]  In relation to some of the
[26:52.080 --> 26:54.080]  One of the things I saw yesterday
[26:54.080 --> 26:56.080]  You know, we signed the
[26:56.080 --> 26:58.080]  Parents' Rights and Education Bill
[26:58.080 --> 26:59.080]  It's interesting when like
[26:59.080 --> 27:02.080]  A Disney-owned ABC would put that out on tweet
[27:02.080 --> 27:03.080]  They'd say
[27:03.080 --> 27:06.080]  Governor DeSantis signs bill to prohibit
[27:06.080 --> 27:08.080]  Instruction and sexual identity
[27:08.080 --> 27:11.080]  And gender identity in some grades
[27:11.080 --> 27:12.080]  Some grades
[27:12.080 --> 27:13.080]  Why would they say some grades
[27:13.080 --> 27:15.080]  Instead of K through 3?
[27:15.080 --> 27:16.080]  It's just amazing
[27:16.080 --> 27:17.080]  If you're trying to inform the rich
[27:17.080 --> 27:18.080]  So you saw a lot of this
[27:18.080 --> 27:20.080]  But then for Disney to come out
[27:20.080 --> 27:22.080]  And put a statement and say
[27:22.080 --> 27:25.080]  That the bill should have never passed
[27:25.080 --> 27:27.080]  And that they are going to actively
[27:27.080 --> 27:29.080]  Work to repeal it
[27:29.080 --> 27:31.080]  I think one was fundamentally dishonest
[27:31.080 --> 27:34.080]  But two, I think that crossed the line
[27:34.080 --> 27:36.080]  This state is governed by the interest
[27:36.080 --> 27:38.080]  Of the people of the state of Florida
[27:38.080 --> 27:41.080]  It is not based on the demands
[27:41.080 --> 27:44.080]  Of California corporate executives
[27:44.080 --> 27:46.080]  They do not run this state
[27:46.080 --> 27:48.080]  They do not control this state
[27:48.080 --> 27:50.080]  I also thought it was interesting
[27:50.080 --> 27:51.080]  I talked to the speaker of the house
[27:51.080 --> 27:53.080]  Yesterday afternoon
[27:53.080 --> 27:55.080]  And he said Disney never called him
[27:55.080 --> 27:57.080]  While they were putting this through the house
[27:57.080 --> 27:59.080]  They didn't seem to have a problem with it
[27:59.080 --> 28:00.080]  When it was going through
[28:00.080 --> 28:01.080]  Such an affront
[28:01.080 --> 28:03.080]  Why weren't they speaking up at the outset
[28:03.080 --> 28:04.080]  And yet they won't
[28:04.080 --> 28:05.080]  And then for them to say
[28:05.080 --> 28:07.080]  They're going to actively work
[28:07.080 --> 28:11.080]  To repeal substantive protections for parents
[28:11.080 --> 28:13.080]  As a company that is supposedly
[28:13.080 --> 28:15.080]  Marketing its services to parents
[28:15.080 --> 28:16.080]  With young children
[28:16.080 --> 28:18.080]  I think they crossed the line
[28:18.080 --> 28:20.080]  And people ask me
[28:20.080 --> 28:22.080]  Kind of about their posture on the bill
[28:22.080 --> 28:23.080]  I said, you know what?
[28:23.080 --> 28:26.080]  If we would have put in the bill
[28:26.080 --> 28:29.080]  That you were not allowed to have curriculum
[28:29.080 --> 28:32.080]  That discussed the oppression of the Uighurs in China
[28:32.080 --> 28:35.080]  Disney would have endorsed that in a second
[28:35.080 --> 28:37.080]  And that's the hypocrisy of this
[28:37.080 --> 28:40.080]  And we're going to make sure we're fighting back
[28:40.080 --> 28:42.080]  When people are threatening our parents
[28:42.080 --> 28:44.080]  And threatening our kids
[28:44.080 --> 28:47.080]  And by the way, folks
[28:47.080 --> 28:49.080]  If anything, the bill's suetimate
[28:49.080 --> 28:50.080]  It should be
[28:50.080 --> 28:52.080]  You could teach biology
[28:52.080 --> 28:54.080]  And about sexual diseases in school
[28:54.080 --> 28:55.080]  And that's it
[28:55.080 --> 28:57.080]  You don't teach about what kind of sex
[28:57.080 --> 28:59.080]  We're going to see a difference
[28:59.080 --> 29:03.080]  We're only offering three coins in the series
[29:03.080 --> 29:06.080]  The first coin was released in December of 2021
[29:06.080 --> 29:08.080]  And sold out in ten days
[29:08.080 --> 29:10.080]  Now the second coin as we enter
[29:10.080 --> 29:12.080]  The last days of March into April
[29:12.080 --> 29:15.080]  2022 is now being offered
[29:15.080 --> 29:18.080]  I believe it will sell out in just a few days
[29:18.080 --> 29:20.080]  Again, because these are historic coins
[29:20.080 --> 29:22.080]  And because our amazing listeners
[29:22.080 --> 29:23.080]  Want to support freedom

[29:25.080 --> 29:26.080]  Of the fight against these tyrants

[33:23.080 --> 33:41.080]  Well, the most demonized member of congress
[33:41.080 --> 33:43.080]  That means the most feared
[33:43.080 --> 33:45.080]  On the biggest landslide
[33:45.080 --> 33:46.080]  Just two years ago
[33:46.080 --> 33:47.080]  We got to get her back in
[33:47.080 --> 33:52.080]  MTG is joining us here
[33:52.080 --> 33:54.080]  To discuss and talk about
[33:54.080 --> 33:56.080]  The nightmare developments
[33:56.080 --> 33:58.080]  Of the coming out of Disney
[33:58.080 --> 33:59.080]  And the coming out of the democrats
[33:59.080 --> 34:02.080]  I mean, we're going to add this in post later
[34:02.080 --> 34:03.080]  We're live right now
[34:03.080 --> 34:04.080]  But later when we archive this
[34:04.080 --> 34:05.080]  To Band-Aid video
[34:05.080 --> 34:06.080]  Where millions will watch it
[34:06.080 --> 34:07.080]  Outside the live show
[34:07.080 --> 34:09.080]  We're going to add these clips
[34:09.080 --> 34:11.080]  Of MSNBC host and other saying
[34:11.080 --> 34:13.080]  We need to tell kindergarteners about our love life
[34:13.080 --> 34:15.080]  With other people
[34:15.080 --> 34:16.080]  I don't care if it's heterosexual or homosexual
[34:16.080 --> 34:17.080]  They shouldn't do it
[34:17.080 --> 34:19.080]  I've got Disney execs saying
[34:19.080 --> 34:20.080]  They're trying to erase this
[34:20.080 --> 34:22.080]  DeSantis is trying to criminalize this
[34:22.080 --> 34:23.080]  When you all
[34:23.080 --> 34:24.080]  I've got the bill
[34:24.080 --> 34:25.080]  They just said don't tell people
[34:25.080 --> 34:27.080]  First grade through time
[34:27.080 --> 34:29.080]  They're eight years old or whatever
[34:29.080 --> 34:32.080]  About sex and their identity
[34:32.080 --> 34:33.080]  And all this
[34:33.080 --> 34:34.080]  This is incredible
[34:34.080 --> 34:36.080]  So looking at this
[34:36.080 --> 34:38.080]  And the world awakening to it
[34:38.080 --> 34:39.080]  But I love Trump
[34:39.080 --> 34:40.080]  But I got to tell you
[34:40.080 --> 34:41.080]  DeSantis coming out
[34:41.080 --> 34:43.080]  And being like MTG
[34:43.080 --> 34:44.080]  And saying I don't care
[34:44.080 --> 34:45.080]  What Hollywood of the media says
[34:45.080 --> 34:46.080]  You don't run our state
[34:46.080 --> 34:47.080]  You don't run us
[34:47.080 --> 34:48.080]  Go to hell
[34:48.080 --> 34:49.080]  We're going to protect our children
[34:49.080 --> 34:51.080]  And the fact that he's not intimidated
[34:51.080 --> 34:53.080]  Is an example to us all
[34:53.080 --> 34:55.080]  Just as Marjorie Taylor Green has been
[34:55.080 --> 34:57.080]  So we salute the great congresswoman
[34:57.080 --> 34:59.080]  From Georgia to talk about this
[34:59.080 --> 35:00.080]  It's good to see you there
[35:00.080 --> 35:02.080]  Thank you for coming on
[35:02.080 --> 35:04.080]  Thanks for having me Alex
[35:04.080 --> 35:06.080]  And I totally agree with you
[35:06.080 --> 35:07.080]  At this point
[35:07.080 --> 35:09.080]  And stage in our history
[35:09.080 --> 35:11.080]  And what's happened in our country
[35:11.080 --> 35:13.080]  Every single person needs to be
[35:13.080 --> 35:14.080]  All hands on deck
[35:14.080 --> 35:15.080]  And protecting our children
[35:15.080 --> 35:18.080]  And stopping this radical
[35:18.080 --> 35:20.080]  Sexualization of children
[35:20.080 --> 35:22.080]  They're basically exploiting them
[35:22.080 --> 35:23.080]  Brainwashing them
[35:23.080 --> 35:25.080]  Indoctrinating them
[35:25.080 --> 35:28.080]  And it's hard to believe that Disney
[35:28.080 --> 35:29.080]  Walt Disney
[35:29.080 --> 35:30.080]  Walt Disney Company
[35:30.080 --> 35:33.080]  Would be the very place that this is happening
[35:33.080 --> 35:35.080]  This is supposed to be the happiest place on earth
[35:35.080 --> 35:38.080]  A place where innocence is celebrated
[35:38.080 --> 35:40.080]  But it seems to be the place where innocence
[35:40.080 --> 35:42.080]  Is actually under attack
[35:42.080 --> 35:44.080]  And I applaud Governor DeSantis
[35:44.080 --> 35:45.080]  For this bill
[35:45.080 --> 35:47.080]  And for his willingness to take on this issue
[35:47.080 --> 35:50.080]  And I'll be working with my colleagues
[35:50.080 --> 35:51.080]  Here in Congress
[35:51.080 --> 35:53.080]  I believe that it is the most important thing
[35:53.080 --> 35:55.080]  The Republican Party can do
[35:55.080 --> 35:57.080]  Is to stand up for families
[35:57.080 --> 35:58.080]  And that's what we should do
[35:58.080 --> 36:00.080]  Is we should be protecting our most innocent
[36:00.080 --> 36:02.080]  Citizens in our country
[36:02.080 --> 36:03.080]  And that is our children
[36:03.080 --> 36:06.080]  Every single minor under the age of 18
[36:06.080 --> 36:08.080]  Should be protected
[36:08.080 --> 36:11.080]  Just their body, their mind, their soul
[36:11.080 --> 36:13.080]  We have to protect them
[36:13.080 --> 36:14.080]  Leave them alone
[36:14.080 --> 36:15.080]  Let them grow up
[36:15.080 --> 36:18.080]  And educate them in wholesome good education
[36:18.080 --> 36:20.080]  And let them become adults
[36:20.080 --> 36:21.080]  And make their own decisions
[36:21.080 --> 36:23.080]  But this is outrageous
[36:23.080 --> 36:25.080]  And Walt Disney
[36:25.080 --> 36:27.080]  They need to pay the serious price for this
[36:27.080 --> 36:28.080]  You were on about a month ago
[36:28.080 --> 36:30.080]  And you talked about biological men
[36:30.080 --> 36:32.080]  Going into little girl showers
[36:32.080 --> 36:33.080]  Going into these places and saying
[36:33.080 --> 36:35.080]  Man, if my husband caught somebody with my daughter
[36:35.080 --> 36:36.080]  They'd be in trouble
[36:36.080 --> 36:37.080]  That's just a normal statement
[36:37.080 --> 36:40.080]  They said, oh, MTG calls for beating up transgenders
[36:40.080 --> 36:42.080]  You explain, no, we're not saying
[36:42.080 --> 36:44.080]  If a man thinks he's a woman
[36:44.080 --> 36:46.080]  Or any of these people that we hate them
[36:46.080 --> 36:47.080]  And I share your view
[36:47.080 --> 36:48.080]  If people do hate them, that's their right
[36:48.080 --> 36:50.080]  If they love them, that's their right
[36:50.080 --> 36:52.080]  They never quote what you actually say
[36:52.080 --> 36:53.080]  And of course they're going to say here
[36:53.080 --> 36:54.080]  You endorse violence
[36:54.080 --> 36:56.080]  You endorse banning these people
[36:56.080 --> 36:59.080]  No, we ban anybody
[36:59.080 --> 37:00.080]  Imagine if we were at the park
[37:00.080 --> 37:02.080]  And we're at Cook and Hamburgers
[37:02.080 --> 37:04.080]  And some dude walks over and asks your kids
[37:04.080 --> 37:06.080]  Hey, can I talk to your kids about sex?
[37:06.080 --> 37:07.080]  You'd call the police
[37:07.080 --> 37:10.080]  But now they just want to do it in the schools
[37:10.080 --> 37:13.080]  And confuse our little five-year-old and six-year-old children
[37:13.080 --> 37:14.080]  This is ridiculous
[37:14.080 --> 37:16.080]  This is unbelievable
[37:16.080 --> 37:17.080]  And then we see the footage
[37:17.080 --> 37:19.080]  Even here in Austin of elementary students
[37:19.080 --> 37:21.080]  Being paraded around like trophies
[37:21.080 --> 37:23.080]  And drag queens, big fat men
[37:23.080 --> 37:25.080]  And clown suits rubbing all over them
[37:25.080 --> 37:26.080]  And hugging them and all this
[37:26.080 --> 37:29.080]  I mean, this is crazy
[37:29.080 --> 37:30.080]  It is crazy
[37:30.080 --> 37:31.080]  And you know what?
[37:31.080 --> 37:33.080]  There's nothing wrong with being angry about it
[37:33.080 --> 37:35.080]  And there's nothing wrong as a parent
[37:35.080 --> 37:37.080]  Or just a regular American
[37:37.080 --> 37:40.080]  That is willing to say that this is outrageous
[37:40.080 --> 37:41.080]  And it has to stop
[37:41.080 --> 37:43.080]  And willing to stop it
[37:43.080 --> 37:44.080]  And that's what we all need to do
[37:44.080 --> 37:46.080]  Is we need to be willing to stop it
[37:46.080 --> 37:47.080]  You know, they have an agenda
[37:47.080 --> 37:49.080]  And the agenda is very clear
[37:49.080 --> 37:51.080]  It is to sexualize children
[37:51.080 --> 37:53.080]  It's to confuse them
[37:53.080 --> 37:56.080]  And make them think that they can choose their gender
[37:56.080 --> 37:58.080]  Which absolutely they cannot
[37:58.080 --> 38:01.080]  And I will stand on God's truth every single time
[38:01.080 --> 38:03.080]  There are two genders, male and female
[38:03.080 --> 38:05.080]  And God made us in His image
[38:05.080 --> 38:06.080]  Male or female
[38:06.080 --> 38:07.080]  And that's just the truth
[38:07.080 --> 38:09.080]  It's in the Bible, it's in Genesis
[38:09.080 --> 38:12.080]  And it's just the flat-out truth, Alex
[38:12.080 --> 38:16.080]  And the whole idea that teachers
[38:16.080 --> 38:18.080]  Teachers unions
[38:18.080 --> 38:20.080]  Radical activists
[38:20.080 --> 38:23.080]  That are onto this horrible agenda
[38:23.080 --> 38:25.080]  Where they want to indoctrinate
[38:25.080 --> 38:28.080]  Sexualized children, confuse them
[38:28.080 --> 38:30.080]  Think they can change their gender
[38:30.080 --> 38:32.080]  Or encourage them
[38:32.080 --> 38:35.080]  Like Pete Buttigieg's husband did
[38:35.080 --> 38:38.080]  I saw him on video with among children
[38:38.080 --> 38:41.080]  And he had them saying the pledge
[38:41.080 --> 38:44.080]  To the pride flag or something
[38:44.080 --> 38:47.080]  No, I'm sorry, we have one pledge in this country
[38:47.080 --> 38:49.080]  And that is to our American flag
[38:49.080 --> 38:54.080]  And we pledge that allegiance to our country's flag
[38:54.080 --> 38:56.080]  It shouldn't be pledging allegiance
[38:56.080 --> 38:58.080]  To some sort of movement
[38:58.080 --> 39:00.080]  Or sexualization of children
[39:00.080 --> 39:03.080]  So, you know, all of them need to leave kids alone
[39:03.080 --> 39:06.080]  And there's nothing wrong with being against this
[39:06.080 --> 39:09.080]  And, you know, men need to stay out of our sports
[39:09.080 --> 39:10.080]  Women are under attack
[39:10.080 --> 39:13.080]  It's not just children, it's also women
[39:13.080 --> 39:15.080]  They are trying to replace us
[39:15.080 --> 39:18.080]  They're trying to replace us in our sports
[39:18.080 --> 39:20.080]  Absolutely, listen, I'm not against people
[39:20.080 --> 39:22.080]  Because they're homosexual
[39:22.080 --> 39:23.080]  Because there's some nice folks out there
[39:23.080 --> 39:26.080]  But a lot of these people do not like women, period
[39:26.080 --> 39:28.080]  And this is an attack
[39:28.080 --> 39:29.080]  And like a takeover
[39:29.080 --> 39:31.080]  It's a robbery of women's space
[39:31.080 --> 39:32.080]  And it needs to stop
[39:32.080 --> 39:35.080]  So bare minimum, it's a bunch of women haters
[39:35.080 --> 39:37.080]  And then on the other end, it's pedophiles
[39:37.080 --> 39:40.080]  And of course, you know, the San Francisco gay choir
[39:40.080 --> 39:42.080]  I made the point on air when this came out last year
[39:42.080 --> 39:44.080]  When they said, we're going to recruit your children
[39:44.080 --> 39:45.080]  We're going to groom them, we're going to get them
[39:45.080 --> 39:47.080]  You can't stop us parents
[39:47.080 --> 39:49.080]  We are recruiting them
[39:49.080 --> 39:51.080]  I said, I bet a bunch of them turned out to be convicted
[39:51.080 --> 39:53.080]  Pedophiles and rapists and a bunch of them were
[39:53.080 --> 39:56.080]  So, I mean, this is dangerous
[39:56.080 --> 39:57.080]  It is dangerous
[39:57.080 --> 39:59.080]  And listen, I totally agree with you, Alex
[39:59.080 --> 40:02.080]  It's not about someone's sexuality
[40:02.080 --> 40:05.080]  It's not a judgment on what they choose to do privately
[40:05.080 --> 40:07.080]  Sexually, I don't judge that at all
[40:07.080 --> 40:09.080]  And that's none of my business
[40:09.080 --> 40:10.080]  And I don't want to know
[40:10.080 --> 40:14.080]  And so it's not about being against someone being gay
[40:14.080 --> 40:16.080]  Or whatever their choices are
[40:16.080 --> 40:17.080]  It's about our kids
[40:17.080 --> 40:19.080]  Leave the kids alone
[40:19.080 --> 40:21.080]  And it's about women's rights
[40:21.080 --> 40:22.080]  Stay out of our sports
[40:22.080 --> 40:24.080]  Stay out of our bathrooms
[40:24.080 --> 40:25.080]  Stay out of our dorm rooms
[40:25.080 --> 40:29.080]  And stop this brainwashing and indoctrination
[40:29.080 --> 40:30.080]  Of children
[40:30.080 --> 40:32.080]  All of this doesn't belong in school
[40:32.080 --> 40:34.080]  And, you know, it doesn't make me hateful
[40:34.080 --> 40:36.080]  To say these things
[40:36.080 --> 40:39.080]  And be willing to speak out against it
[40:39.080 --> 40:42.080]  It makes me a person that's willing to speak the truth
[40:42.080 --> 40:43.080]  And it makes me someone
[40:43.080 --> 40:45.080]  That's willing to stand up for children
[40:45.080 --> 40:47.080]  And protect their innocence
[40:47.080 --> 40:49.080]  And protect their own identity
[40:49.080 --> 40:52.080]  And stop this assault on their character
[40:52.080 --> 40:55.080]  And stop this assault on basically
[40:55.080 --> 40:57.080]  On what they believe about themselves
[40:57.080 --> 40:59.080]  It's outrageous that this is happening
[40:59.080 --> 41:03.080]  And it's not wrong to stand up for female athletes
[41:03.080 --> 41:06.080]  Legitimate biological female athletes
[41:06.080 --> 41:08.080]  That are unwilling to do so
[41:08.080 --> 41:09.080]  Because Alex, the truth is
[41:09.080 --> 41:14.080]  If you're an athlete on scholarship in college
[41:14.080 --> 41:15.080]  There's a lot of rules
[41:15.080 --> 41:17.080]  On what you're allowed to say publicly
[41:17.080 --> 41:19.080]  Especially when it comes to college
[41:19.080 --> 41:20.080]  That's right, they can't speak for themselves
[41:20.080 --> 41:21.080]  We should speak for them
[41:21.080 --> 41:23.080]  And we should end this bullying tyranny
[41:23.080 --> 41:26.080]  Because the left and all this LGBT
[41:26.080 --> 41:28.080]  Is a sex cult
[41:28.080 --> 41:30.080]  I mean, most of the cults in ancient times
[41:30.080 --> 41:31.080]  Were sexually based
[41:31.080 --> 41:33.080]  And Alistair Crowley was sex based
[41:33.080 --> 41:35.080]  And they literally know that as you get older
[41:35.080 --> 41:36.080]  You learn about your boundaries
[41:36.080 --> 41:37.080]  And what you want to do
[41:37.080 --> 41:39.080]  A child doesn't know
[41:39.080 --> 41:40.080]  That's why they're not of age
[41:40.080 --> 41:41.080]  It's why they can't join the military
[41:41.080 --> 41:43.080]  It's why they can't drink liquor
[41:43.080 --> 41:44.080]  It's why they can't get a firearm
[41:44.080 --> 41:46.080]  But five-year-olds, Disney believes
[41:46.080 --> 41:49.080]  Should have talks with their LGBT people
[41:49.080 --> 41:50.080]  About maybe they're another sex
[41:50.080 --> 41:52.080]  Well, of course, it's going to confuse them
[41:52.080 --> 41:53.080]  They're going to go, yeah
[41:53.080 --> 41:54.080]  The little boy will say, I like boys
[41:54.080 --> 41:55.080]  The little boys like boys
[41:55.080 --> 41:56.080]  And be friends with them
[41:56.080 --> 41:57.080]  Little girls like girls
[41:57.080 --> 41:59.080]  And now you're saying, oh, you like them
[41:59.080 --> 42:00.080]  That's who you are
[42:00.080 --> 42:02.080]  It's pure social engineering
[42:02.080 --> 42:03.080]  Behavioral psychology
[42:03.080 --> 42:04.080]  Raping their innocence
[42:04.080 --> 42:06.080]  It is disgusting
[42:06.080 --> 42:08.080]  Well, it's also preditorial
[42:08.080 --> 42:10.080]  I'm willing to use that word
[42:10.080 --> 42:12.080]  This is preditorial
[42:12.080 --> 42:13.080]  This is not...
[42:13.080 --> 42:14.080]  This didn't happen
[42:14.080 --> 42:16.080]  When you and I were growing up
[42:16.080 --> 42:17.080]  This didn't happen
[42:17.080 --> 42:20.080]  Maybe even 10 to 15 years ago
[42:20.080 --> 42:22.080]  But this is preditorial behavior
[42:22.080 --> 42:24.080]  This is hyper-predatory behavior
[42:24.080 --> 42:25.080]  You're totally right
[42:25.080 --> 42:28.080]  One word describes it, preditorial
[42:28.080 --> 42:32.080]  And if anyone that is against stopping this
[42:32.080 --> 42:35.080]  And is saying no, they should be allowed
[42:35.080 --> 42:39.080]  To indoctrinate children into just wrong
[42:39.080 --> 42:41.080]  Sexual immorality
[42:41.080 --> 42:42.080]  You know what?
[42:42.080 --> 42:44.080]  That means they are pro-preditorial behavior
[42:44.080 --> 42:47.080]  So, you know, we need to challenge everyone
[42:47.080 --> 42:49.080]  If you are for what Disney is doing
[42:49.080 --> 42:52.080]  If you're for what this, like this mother
[42:52.080 --> 42:54.080]  Congresswoman, stay right there
[42:54.080 --> 42:55.080]  We'll be right back
[42:55.080 --> 42:58.080]  Amazing interview with MTG
[42:58.080 --> 43:02.080]  We are only offering three coins in the series
[43:02.080 --> 43:06.080]  The first coin was released in December of 2021
[43:06.080 --> 43:07.080]  And sold out in 10 days
[43:07.080 --> 43:10.080]  Now, the second coin as we enter
[43:10.080 --> 43:13.080]  The last days of March into April, 2022
[43:13.080 --> 43:15.080]  Is now being offered
[43:15.080 --> 43:18.080]  And I believe it will sell out in just a few days again
[43:18.080 --> 43:20.080]  Because these are historic coins
[43:20.080 --> 43:21.080]  And because our amazing listeners
[43:21.080 --> 43:23.080]  Want to support freedom
[43:23.080 --> 43:25.080]  To keep info wars at the front lines
[43:25.080 --> 43:27.080]  Of the fight against these tyrants
[43:27.080 --> 43:31.080]  So, go for yourself to 1776coin.com
[43:31.080 --> 43:34.080]  And see the new Liberty Tree coin
[43:34.080 --> 43:36.080]  It is powerful
[43:36.080 --> 43:39.080]  Witness this powerful iconography for yourself
[43:39.080 --> 43:41.080]  And have this piece of history
[43:41.080 --> 43:44.080]  And be part of the founding member system
[43:44.080 --> 43:47.080]  That we're set to launch in the very near future
[43:47.080 --> 43:50.080]  Thanks to your support of this project
[43:50.080 --> 43:52.080]  Get a historic memento
[43:52.080 --> 43:54.080]  Keep info wars on the air
[43:54.080 --> 43:57.080]  And also gives you a real piece of history
[43:57.080 --> 44:26.080]  From 1776coin.com
[44:27.080 --> 44:30.080]  And now we have a series of good people all around the world
[44:30.080 --> 44:33.080]  And of doctors and scientists and engineers
[44:33.080 --> 44:35.080]  That are exposing all their lives
[44:35.080 --> 44:37.080]  Their COVID hysteria
[44:37.080 --> 44:39.080]  Their world's gonna end in 2030
[44:39.080 --> 44:42.080]  Carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it
[44:42.080 --> 44:44.080]  And none of it can succeed
[44:44.080 --> 44:46.080]  None of it can actually be carried out
[44:46.080 --> 44:49.080]  Unless everybody is silenced and gas lit
[44:49.080 --> 44:52.080]  And that's why truth comes with hard work
[44:52.080 --> 44:53.080]  And with research and with diligence
[44:53.080 --> 44:56.080]  And that's why it's hard to share info wars links
[44:56.080 --> 44:59.080]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever
[45:26.080 --> 45:28.080]  Thanks to you who does wonders
[45:28.080 --> 45:29.080]  I recommend it to everybody
[45:29.080 --> 45:30.080]  You're on the fence about it
[45:30.080 --> 45:31.080]  Get off the fence
[45:31.080 --> 45:32.080]  Get the product
[45:32.080 --> 45:33.080]  Support the info war
[45:33.080 --> 45:34.080]  Tyler in Maine
[45:34.080 --> 45:35.080]  You're on the air
[45:35.080 --> 45:36.080]  Thanks for rolling, go ahead
[45:36.080 --> 45:37.080]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you
[45:37.080 --> 45:38.080]  It's an honor
[45:38.080 --> 45:39.080]  Honor, talk to you
[45:39.080 --> 45:40.080]  Awesome
[45:40.080 --> 45:42.080]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say
[45:42.080 --> 45:44.080]  I love the products, alpha power
[45:44.080 --> 45:45.080]  Even at 29
[45:45.080 --> 45:47.080]  If you ask my better half
[45:47.080 --> 45:48.080]  She loves it
[45:48.080 --> 45:49.080]  And it helps with the bedroom
[45:49.080 --> 45:51.080]  So, just number one for a few of you
[45:51.080 --> 45:52.080]  Well, it definitely works
[45:52.080 --> 45:53.080]  It's not a joke
[45:53.080 --> 45:56.080]  Absolutely
[46:23.080 --> 46:25.080]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product
[46:25.080 --> 46:27.080]  Concentrated elderberry
[46:27.080 --> 46:29.080]  Concentrated echinacea
[46:29.080 --> 46:30.080]  Concentrated astragalus root
[46:30.080 --> 46:32.080]  Angelica root
[46:32.080 --> 46:33.080]  Loetium root
[46:33.080 --> 46:34.080]  And more
[46:34.080 --> 46:36.080]  This product is incredible
[46:36.080 --> 46:38.080]  Info wars immune support
[46:38.080 --> 46:39.080]  Exclusively available
[46:39.080 --> 46:41.080]  At infowarstore.com
[46:41.080 --> 46:42.080]  Is funding the tip of the spear
[46:42.080 --> 46:44.080]  The info wars operation
[46:44.080 --> 46:45.080]  It is a 360 win
[46:45.080 --> 46:48.080]  The only way you fail is by not taking action
[46:48.080 --> 46:49.080]  And getting this product
[46:49.080 --> 46:51.080]  To boost your body's natural defenses
[46:51.080 --> 46:52.080]  And keep info wars on the air
[46:52.080 --> 46:54.080]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action
[46:54.080 --> 46:55.080]  Take action now
[46:55.080 --> 47:23.080]  Infowarstore.com
[47:25.080 --> 47:35.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is beyond Hollywood, Babylon
[47:35.080 --> 47:36.080]  I'm Alex Jones, your host
[47:36.080 --> 47:38.080]  Final segment with Marjorie Taylor Greene
[47:38.080 --> 47:39.080]  Joining us
[47:39.080 --> 47:42.080]  Congresswoman from Georgia
[47:42.080 --> 47:44.080]  Again, let's just talk about
[47:44.080 --> 47:47.080]  Normal biological male-female relationships
[47:47.080 --> 47:50.080]  Anybody knows that has any game
[47:50.080 --> 47:53.080]  That, you know, you're a single male, single female, whatever
[47:53.080 --> 47:54.080]  You don't run up and say
[47:54.080 --> 47:55.080]  What sex are you?
[47:55.080 --> 47:56.080]  Or what sex are you into?
[47:56.080 --> 47:57.080]  Let's talk about sex
[47:57.080 --> 47:59.080]  Women, men
[47:59.080 --> 48:00.080]  Because I've had, you know, women now
[48:00.080 --> 48:01.080]  That I'm famous, whatever
[48:01.080 --> 48:02.080]  Come on, I'm sort of talking about sex right away
[48:02.080 --> 48:05.080]  And I'm like, whoa, this is a little weird
[48:05.080 --> 48:06.080]  Even men run away from that
[48:06.080 --> 48:08.080]  I mean, my wife would run away
[48:08.080 --> 48:10.080]  If I showed up while she's, you know, cooking dinner
[48:10.080 --> 48:11.080]  Or doing something with my daughter
[48:11.080 --> 48:12.080]  Like, hey, baby, let's have sex
[48:12.080 --> 48:15.080]  And she'd be like, what's going on here?
[48:15.080 --> 48:16.080]  You're here for play
[48:16.080 --> 48:19.080]  There's not even for play with these pedos
[48:19.080 --> 48:20.080]  That's what they are
[48:20.080 --> 48:22.080]  And pedo enablers and griminers
[48:22.080 --> 48:24.080]  They're coming right into five, six, seven-year-olds going
[48:24.080 --> 48:26.080]  We're going to talk about your sex
[48:26.080 --> 48:27.080]  We're going to paint your nails
[48:27.080 --> 48:29.080]  We're going to have a man in a woman's outfit
[48:29.080 --> 48:31.080]  With a wig who weighs 400 pounds
[48:31.080 --> 48:33.080]  Have you sit in their lap?
[48:33.080 --> 48:35.080]  We're going to have weird leftist parents
[48:35.080 --> 48:36.080]  Bring their kids to these events
[48:36.080 --> 48:39.080]  I mean, this is the creepiest, weirdest, craziest stuff
[48:39.080 --> 48:42.080]  If 20 years ago they had a movie about a future dystopia
[48:42.080 --> 48:44.080]  Where pedophiles are doing all this
[48:44.080 --> 48:45.080]  I wouldn't believe it
[48:45.080 --> 48:48.080]  And so again, as an adult
[48:48.080 --> 48:50.080]  Think about on a dating app
[48:50.080 --> 48:51.080]  If somebody talked to you like this
[48:51.080 --> 48:52.080]  You'd say no
[48:52.080 --> 48:56.080]  As an adult, these are children
[48:56.080 --> 48:59.080]  Being literally attacked worldwide
[48:59.080 --> 49:01.080]  By behavioral psychologist manuals
[49:01.080 --> 49:03.080]  And I notice in these documents I've got right here
[49:03.080 --> 49:05.080]  That have come out in the news from Texas
[49:05.080 --> 49:07.080]  Sad for our state
[49:07.080 --> 49:10.080]  And New York and Oregon and so many places
[49:10.080 --> 49:11.080]  They tell them
[49:11.080 --> 49:12.080]  And then when the parents fight back
[49:12.080 --> 49:13.080]  Here's how you counter
[49:13.080 --> 49:15.080]  And make the children feel like they're victims
[49:15.080 --> 49:17.080]  And now their parents are bad suppressing you
[49:17.080 --> 49:19.080]  Because you don't, as a five-year-old
[49:19.080 --> 49:21.080]  Your parents don't want you learning
[49:21.080 --> 49:23.080]  How to do sexual things
[49:23.080 --> 49:26.080]  I can't even say on an adult radio show
[49:26.080 --> 49:28.080]  In polite company in front of a congresswoman
[49:28.080 --> 49:31.080]  I mean, this is just over the top insane
[49:31.080 --> 49:33.080]  How do we counter this?
[49:33.080 --> 49:35.080]  What's your response to it?
[49:35.080 --> 49:38.080]  Our response, Alex, is we should be
[49:38.080 --> 49:41.080]  Unapologetic in fighting back
[49:41.080 --> 49:42.080]  That is our job
[49:42.080 --> 49:43.080]  Our job is parents
[49:43.080 --> 49:46.080]  Our job is responsible adults
[49:46.080 --> 49:48.080]  Our job is to protect children
[49:48.080 --> 49:49.080]  And these are predators
[49:49.080 --> 49:52.080]  These are absolutely child predators
[49:52.080 --> 49:55.080]  Not only are we talking about pedophiles
[49:55.080 --> 49:57.080]  But we're also talking about anyone
[49:57.080 --> 50:01.080]  That is willing to coerce a child
[50:01.080 --> 50:04.080]  Indoctrinate a child about sex
[50:04.080 --> 50:07.080]  And about themselves and their own body
[50:07.080 --> 50:09.080]  That is indoctrination
[50:09.080 --> 50:11.080]  And that is predatorial behavior
[50:11.080 --> 50:13.080]  And it must be stopped
[50:13.080 --> 50:15.080]  It all means necessary
[50:15.080 --> 50:16.080]  It has to be stopped
[50:16.080 --> 50:18.080]  You see, the problem is, Alex
[50:18.080 --> 50:20.080]  We've turned our head the other way
[50:20.080 --> 50:23.080]  Because we are constantly getting shamed
[50:23.080 --> 50:25.080]  They're telling us, oh, you're hateful
[50:25.080 --> 50:28.080]  You know, you're a homophobic
[50:28.080 --> 50:30.080]  If you're against these things
[50:30.080 --> 50:32.080]  And I agree totally with you, Alex
[50:32.080 --> 50:35.080]  We're not hateful, we're not homophobic
[50:35.080 --> 50:37.080]  It's not about pedophobic
[50:37.080 --> 50:39.080]  Can you say that in your own words?
[50:39.080 --> 50:40.080]  It'll be a huge news story
[50:40.080 --> 50:42.080]  MTG is not pedophobic
[50:42.080 --> 50:44.080]  Say it in your own words, please
[50:44.080 --> 50:47.080]  Oh, no, I'm definitely pedophobic
[50:47.080 --> 50:49.080]  I'm absolutely against pedophiles
[50:49.080 --> 50:51.080]  Good, oh, I was going to shame you
[50:51.080 --> 50:52.080]  Into being pro-pedophile
[50:52.080 --> 50:54.080]  Oh, I can't have you on, you're hateful
[50:54.080 --> 50:55.080]  So you're against adults
[50:55.080 --> 50:57.080]  Picking up five-year-olds in parks
[50:57.080 --> 50:58.080]  Or out of their backyards
[50:58.080 --> 51:01.080]  Because Nambla and all of them
[51:01.080 --> 51:03.080]  Say that they are adults
[51:03.080 --> 51:05.080]  That children are sexual creatures
[51:05.080 --> 51:07.080]  And that they have the free will
[51:07.080 --> 51:08.080]  To have sex with adults
[51:08.080 --> 51:10.080]  So you are a pedophobe
[51:10.080 --> 51:13.080]  Shame on you
[51:13.080 --> 51:15.080]  Yeah, no, I'm not going to be afraid
[51:15.080 --> 51:17.080]  To say that 100%
[51:17.080 --> 51:18.080]  Well, I'm going to say this
[51:18.080 --> 51:20.080]  I am completely phobic
[51:20.080 --> 51:22.080]  Of pedophiles and predators in general
[51:22.080 --> 51:23.080]  And armed robbers
[51:23.080 --> 51:25.080]  And every other form of criminal
[51:25.080 --> 51:27.080]  Absolutely, but particularly pedophilia
[51:27.080 --> 51:30.080]  The way it's just flooding society
[51:30.080 --> 51:32.080]  Absolutely, we should be
[51:32.080 --> 51:33.080]  Everyone should be
[51:33.080 --> 51:35.080]  And shame on anyone that's not
[51:35.080 --> 51:37.080]  This should never be normalized
[51:37.080 --> 51:39.080]  Children are not sexual creatures
[51:39.080 --> 51:41.080]  You cannot be someone that claims
[51:41.080 --> 51:43.080]  To be attracted to children
[51:43.080 --> 51:44.080]  And think that that's okay
[51:44.080 --> 51:45.080]  That is absolutely not okay
[51:45.080 --> 51:46.080]  It's evil
[51:46.080 --> 51:48.080]  And everything about it is evil
[51:48.080 --> 51:50.080]  And we're never going to accept it
[51:50.080 --> 51:52.080]  And that doesn't make us a bad person
[51:52.080 --> 51:54.080]  For refusing to accept it
[51:54.080 --> 51:56.080]  And saying, no, we're going to stop you
[51:56.080 --> 51:57.080]  At every single turn
[51:57.080 --> 51:58.080]  As a matter of fact
[51:58.080 --> 51:59.080]  We're going to bring laws
[51:59.080 --> 52:01.080]  More laws against you
[52:01.080 --> 52:02.080]  For doing these things
[52:02.080 --> 52:04.080]  There is nothing wrong with that
[52:04.080 --> 52:06.080]  That puts us on the right side of history
[52:06.080 --> 52:08.080]  And that puts us in the category
[52:08.080 --> 52:10.080]  Of protecting children
[52:10.080 --> 52:12.080]  And Alex, I totally agree with you
[52:12.080 --> 52:14.080]  I mean, there's nothing wrong with saying
[52:14.080 --> 52:17.080]  I am pedophobic or whatever this is
[52:17.080 --> 52:19.080]  But, you know, it's enough
[52:19.080 --> 52:20.080]  I've had enough of it
[52:20.080 --> 52:21.080]  I know you've had enough of it
[52:21.080 --> 52:23.080]  And parents have had enough of it
[52:23.080 --> 52:25.080]  And shame on Hollywood
[52:25.080 --> 52:27.080]  Shame on Disney World
[52:27.080 --> 52:29.080]  Shame on any major corporation
[52:29.080 --> 52:31.080]  That wants to sell clothing
[52:31.080 --> 52:34.080]  That basically sells the sexual image
[52:34.080 --> 52:35.080]  With children
[52:35.080 --> 52:37.080]  You know, shame on any legislator
[52:37.080 --> 52:39.080]  Shame on any member of Congress, senator
[52:39.080 --> 52:42.080]  Anyone, state level, federal level
[52:42.080 --> 52:44.080]  That is willing to push this
[52:44.080 --> 52:45.080]  And keep pushing it
[52:45.080 --> 52:46.080]  And shame on teachers' unions
[52:46.080 --> 52:48.080]  That will not stop this
[52:48.080 --> 52:50.080]  And are actually encouraging teachers
[52:50.080 --> 52:52.080]  To indoctrinate children
[52:52.080 --> 52:53.080]  And change their gender
[52:53.080 --> 52:54.080]  Without their parents
[52:54.080 --> 52:56.080]  Having any idea that this is happening
[52:56.080 --> 52:57.080]  And by the way
[52:57.080 --> 52:58.080]  I mean, even Bill Marr says
[52:58.080 --> 52:59.080]  He read the bill
[52:59.080 --> 53:00.080]  And yeah, you shouldn't have
[53:00.080 --> 53:01.080]  Five to eight year olds
[53:01.080 --> 53:02.080]  Being taught about sex
[53:02.080 --> 53:04.080]  By perfect strangers
[53:04.080 --> 53:05.080]  Much less parents
[53:05.080 --> 53:06.080]  The kids aren't asking it
[53:06.080 --> 53:07.080]  It screws up children
[53:07.080 --> 53:08.080]  To do that
[53:08.080 --> 53:10.080]  All behavioral psychologists know that
[53:10.080 --> 53:11.080]  But we go back to Nickelodeon
[53:11.080 --> 53:12.080]  Ten years ago
[53:12.080 --> 53:13.080]  Documents came out in Disney
[53:13.080 --> 53:15.080]  Where they planned to do this
[53:15.080 --> 53:17.080]  And it's all about breaking up the family
[53:17.080 --> 53:18.080]  Breaking up society
[53:18.080 --> 53:20.080]  What do you think the bigger goals of this are
[53:20.080 --> 53:21.080]  And what legislation
[53:21.080 --> 53:22.080]  You were talking about earlier
[53:22.080 --> 53:25.080]  Can we support to protect
[53:25.080 --> 53:26.080]  The innocence of our children
[53:26.080 --> 53:29.080]  From these predators?
[53:29.080 --> 53:31.080]  Absolutely, we can do legislation
[53:31.080 --> 53:32.080]  To protect our children
[53:32.080 --> 53:34.080]  You know, Congress makes the laws
[53:34.080 --> 53:36.080]  Congress funds the money
[53:36.080 --> 53:38.080]  That funds agencies
[53:38.080 --> 53:40.080]  And different departments
[53:40.080 --> 53:42.080]  Like the Department of Ed
[53:42.080 --> 53:44.080]  You know, there should be no federal funding
[53:44.080 --> 53:45.080]  To any school
[53:45.080 --> 53:47.080]  Any school anywhere
[53:47.080 --> 53:49.080]  That is indoctrinating children
[53:49.080 --> 53:50.080]  That is teaching them
[53:50.080 --> 53:52.080]  That they can change their gender
[53:52.080 --> 53:53.080]  That is teaching them anything
[53:53.080 --> 53:55.080]  Sick and disgusting like this
[53:55.080 --> 53:57.080]  We should stop all federal funding
[53:57.080 --> 53:58.080]  So are you going to write a bill
[53:58.080 --> 54:00.080]  Or introduce a bill
[54:00.080 --> 54:01.080]  Because you've got the power to do it
[54:01.080 --> 54:02.080]  We would all get behind you
[54:02.080 --> 54:04.080]  A bill to pull federal funding
[54:04.080 --> 54:07.080]  Out of any school that sexualizes children
[54:07.080 --> 54:09.080]  Absolutely, 100%
[54:09.080 --> 54:11.080]  I'll meet with my team
[54:11.080 --> 54:13.080]  Right after this interview
[54:13.080 --> 54:15.080]  And we will get to work on it, Alex
[54:15.080 --> 54:17.080]  Because I will do anything I can
[54:17.080 --> 54:18.080]  To protect kids
[54:18.080 --> 54:21.080]  And I only want allies
[54:21.080 --> 54:22.080]  You know what
[54:22.080 --> 54:23.080]  If someone doesn't like me
[54:23.080 --> 54:25.080]  Or my legislation
[54:25.080 --> 54:26.080]  Then who cares?
[54:26.080 --> 54:27.080]  I don't care
[54:27.080 --> 54:29.080]  But I think most parents
[54:29.080 --> 54:31.080]  And most people in this country
[54:31.080 --> 54:32.080]  Would be on our side
[54:32.080 --> 54:35.080]  And be willing to get behind this
[54:35.080 --> 54:37.080]  Well, I just really appreciate your time
[54:37.080 --> 54:39.080]  And you coming on with us today
[54:39.080 --> 54:41.080]  This subject is just so insane
[54:41.080 --> 54:43.080]  And the left just can't help themselves
[54:43.080 --> 54:45.080]  I mean, there's so many people
[54:45.080 --> 54:47.080]  I think who are liberals
[54:47.080 --> 54:48.080]  Who aren't bad people
[54:48.080 --> 54:49.080]  That are doing this through peer pressure
[54:49.080 --> 54:50.080]  And I just want to ask them
[54:50.080 --> 54:53.080]  How far are you going to go
[54:53.080 --> 54:55.080]  In signing off to this agenda
[54:55.080 --> 54:57.080]  Because this agenda will be defeated
[54:57.080 --> 55:00.080]  Because it's literally the sexualization
[55:00.080 --> 55:01.080]  And destruction of children
[55:01.080 --> 55:03.080]  It must stop, it will stop
[55:03.080 --> 55:05.080]  Yes, it must stop
[55:05.080 --> 55:06.080]  And it has to stop
[55:06.080 --> 55:08.080]  But look, it's already done damage
[55:08.080 --> 55:10.080]  You've got, I think the numbers came out today
[55:10.080 --> 55:14.080]  That 20% of 18 to like 32-year-olds
[55:14.080 --> 55:16.080]  Are gay
[55:16.080 --> 55:18.080]  And that's a much higher number than it used to be
[55:18.080 --> 55:21.080]  So you can already see an effect
[55:21.080 --> 55:22.080]  These are willing adults
[55:22.080 --> 55:23.080]  They're making their own decisions
[55:23.080 --> 55:26.080]  However, that number was a lot lower
[55:26.080 --> 55:29.080]  10 to 20 years ago and so forth
[55:29.080 --> 55:31.080]  Well, they're being bullied
[55:31.080 --> 55:33.080]  They're being bullied into a cult
[55:33.080 --> 55:35.080]  If somebody has free will, that's fine
[55:35.080 --> 55:37.080]  But literally, I've got some numbers here
[55:37.080 --> 55:39.080]  Out of schools where teachers are bragging
[55:39.080 --> 55:41.080]  60% of their students now identify
[55:41.080 --> 55:44.080]  As same sex under this brainwashing
[55:44.080 --> 55:47.080]  I mean, this is an extinction level event
[55:47.080 --> 55:49.080]  Yes, it is
[55:49.080 --> 55:52.080]  And it's a terrible decline of our society
[55:52.080 --> 55:54.080]  And especially when our children
[55:54.080 --> 55:56.080]  Become the victims and the targets
[55:56.080 --> 55:59.080]  Of complete disgusting immorality
[55:59.080 --> 56:01.080]  And that's why we have to stop it
[56:01.080 --> 56:04.080]  It's our job, it's our duty, it's our responsibility
[56:04.080 --> 56:08.080]  And this responsibility sits squarely
[56:08.080 --> 56:09.080]  On our shoulders
[56:09.080 --> 56:11.080]  And that's something I understand
[56:11.080 --> 56:12.080]  That's something you understand
[56:12.080 --> 56:14.080]  And I know your listening audience
[56:14.080 --> 56:15.080]  Totally agrees with us
[56:15.080 --> 56:16.080]  Absolutely, here's the headline
[56:16.080 --> 56:18.080]  Public school indoctrination is real
[56:18.080 --> 56:20.080]  Fourth grade teacher in Austin
[56:20.080 --> 56:22.080]  Told her peers 63% of her class
[56:22.080 --> 56:26.080]  Came out as LGBTQIA
[56:26.080 --> 56:28.080]  I would add the P
[56:28.080 --> 56:30.080]  That's because that teacher
[56:30.080 --> 56:32.080]  Is making that happen
[56:32.080 --> 56:34.080]  She is teaching, just like she would teach
[56:34.080 --> 56:36.080]  Her students math
[56:36.080 --> 56:38.080]  And they could say so much percent
[56:38.080 --> 56:40.080]  Of the children in the math could understand
[56:40.080 --> 56:42.080]  Whatever math that she's teaching them
[56:42.080 --> 56:44.080]  And they can pass the test
[56:44.080 --> 56:47.080]  There she has 63% of her students
[56:47.080 --> 56:50.080]  Passing her tests
[56:50.080 --> 56:52.080]  And she's training her students
[56:52.080 --> 56:54.080]  To believe these horrible things
[56:54.080 --> 56:55.080]  About themselves
[56:55.080 --> 56:57.080]  When they should never be being taught
[56:57.080 --> 56:59.080]  She's got a captive audience of children
[56:59.080 --> 57:01.080]  That are designed to follow adult leaders
[57:01.080 --> 57:02.080]  Their parents drop them off
[57:02.080 --> 57:03.080]  So their parents are good
[57:03.080 --> 57:04.080]  These must be good leaders
[57:04.080 --> 57:06.080]  And then they sit there and indoctrinate them
[57:06.080 --> 57:07.080]  To totally screw them up
[57:07.080 --> 57:09.080]  And bring them into a sex cult
[57:09.080 --> 57:11.080]  I mean, this makes nexium
[57:11.080 --> 57:12.080]  That was with adults
[57:12.080 --> 57:13.080]  And I'm totally against it
[57:13.080 --> 57:14.080]  This makes nexium look tame
[57:14.080 --> 57:15.080]  They're literally setting up
[57:15.080 --> 57:18.080]  Nexium sex cults for children
[57:18.080 --> 57:19.080]  Guys, it's horrific
[57:19.080 --> 57:21.080]  I don't even know why that teacher
[57:21.080 --> 57:22.080]  Still has a job
[57:22.080 --> 57:24.080]  Every single parent that has a child
[57:24.080 --> 57:25.080]  At that school should be demanding
[57:25.080 --> 57:27.080]  That that teacher be fired
[57:27.080 --> 57:29.080]  And then they should also be demanding
[57:29.080 --> 57:31.080]  To completely see everything
[57:31.080 --> 57:32.080]  Absolutely
[57:32.080 --> 57:34.080]  Marjorie Taylor Green, congresswoman
[57:34.080 --> 57:35.080]  If you've got to go, you've got to go
[57:35.080 --> 57:36.080]  We've got to go to break for two minutes
[57:36.080 --> 57:38.080]  We do five more minutes on the other side
[57:38.080 --> 57:39.080]  I want to talk about what happened
[57:39.080 --> 57:41.080]  With congressman Gates calling out
[57:41.080 --> 57:43.080]  The Hunter Biden laptop and so much more
[57:43.080 --> 57:44.080]  You've got to go understand
[57:44.080 --> 57:46.080]  MTG, she's awesome, stay with us
[57:46.080 --> 57:50.080]  In December of 2021
[57:50.080 --> 57:52.080]  InfoWars offered the first
[57:52.080 --> 57:54.080]  In a three-part series
[57:54.080 --> 57:57.080]  The 1776 anti-tyrant coin
[57:57.080 --> 58:00.080]  And it sold out in 10 days
[58:00.080 --> 58:01.080]  And if it wasn't for listeners
[58:01.080 --> 58:04.080]  Getting this original, powerful coin
[58:04.080 --> 58:05.080]  A founding member coin
[58:05.080 --> 58:08.080]  We would not be on air today
[58:08.080 --> 58:10.080]  Now, the second coin
[58:10.080 --> 58:12.080]  The Liberty Tree coin is being offered
[58:12.080 --> 58:14.080]  And it will probably sell out
[58:14.080 --> 58:15.080]  In 10 days again
[58:15.080 --> 58:17.080]  It certainly needs to
[58:17.080 --> 58:18.080]  To fund our operation
[58:18.080 --> 58:20.080]  It is so historic
[58:20.080 --> 58:22.080]  And it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson
[58:22.080 --> 58:24.080]  About the Tree of Liberty being refreshed
[58:24.080 --> 58:26.080]  With the blood of Patriots in Tyrants
[58:26.080 --> 58:27.080]  And more
[58:27.080 --> 58:28.080]  See the coin for yourself
[58:28.080 --> 58:31.080]  At 1776coin.com
[58:31.080 --> 58:33.080]  It's also at infowarstore.com
[58:33.080 --> 58:34.080]  It's amazing
[58:34.080 --> 58:36.080]  There's only 10,000 of them
[58:36.080 --> 58:37.080]  And as a founding member
[58:37.080 --> 58:39.080]  If we're able to stay on the air
[58:39.080 --> 58:41.080]  We're planning something very, very special
[58:41.080 --> 58:44.080]  For everyone that helps us go to the next level
[58:44.080 --> 58:46.080]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin
[58:46.080 --> 58:47.080]  While you still can
[58:47.080 --> 58:49.080]  At 1776coin.com
[58:49.080 --> 58:52.080]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago
[58:52.080 --> 58:53.080]  Were very public about their plans
[58:53.080 --> 58:55.080]  They financed major universities
[58:55.080 --> 58:57.080]  They ran full-page stories
[58:57.080 --> 59:00.080]  And advertisements pushing their propaganda
[59:00.080 --> 59:02.080]  Of New York Times, other major newspapers
[59:02.080 --> 59:04.080]  That the family as we know it
[59:04.080 --> 59:06.080]  Is a bad thing and must be ended
[59:06.080 --> 59:08.080]  And the first step in that
[59:08.080 --> 59:10.080]  Is getting women out of the household
[59:10.080 --> 59:12.080]  And teaching women that cooking dinner
[59:12.080 --> 59:14.080]  And taking care of their sons and daughters
[59:14.080 --> 59:16.080]  And husbands is a bad thing
[59:16.080 --> 59:17.080]  And I was just sitting here tonight
[59:17.080 --> 59:19.080]  Making dinner for my daughter
[59:19.080 --> 59:20.080]  My four-natural daughter
[59:20.080 --> 59:22.080]  And my wife makes dinner a lot of times
[59:22.080 --> 59:23.080]  But I like to make it as well
[59:23.080 --> 59:24.080]  I love to make breakfast
[59:24.080 --> 59:26.080]  And literally it's the funnest thing
[59:26.080 --> 59:28.080]  On earth to make food for your family
[59:28.080 --> 59:30.080]  And be nurturative
[59:30.080 --> 59:31.080]  And then all sit down together
[59:31.080 --> 59:33.080]  And have the communal event
[59:33.080 --> 59:35.080]  And that's what the system is
[59:35.080 --> 59:37.080]  Attacking and bombarding
[59:37.080 --> 59:39.080]  Is our normal biological actions
[59:39.080 --> 59:40.080]  And coming together
[59:40.080 --> 59:43.080]  They really are a sick, evil, scientific cult
[59:43.080 --> 59:45.080]  Of filth and want to domesticate us
[59:45.080 --> 59:47.080]  And turn us into lab rats
[59:47.080 --> 1:00:12.080]  I'm not here to talk about the laptop
[1:00:12.080 --> 1:00:14.080]  I'm here to talk about the FBI cyber program
[1:00:14.080 --> 1:00:16.080]  You are the assistant director
[1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:18.080]  Of FBI cyber
[1:00:18.080 --> 1:00:20.080]  I want to know where Hunter Biden's laptop is
[1:00:20.080 --> 1:00:21.080]  Where is it?
[1:00:21.080 --> 1:00:23.080]  Sir, I don't know that answer
[1:00:23.080 --> 1:00:25.080]  That is astonishing to me
[1:00:25.080 --> 1:00:27.080]  Has FBI cyber assessed
[1:00:27.080 --> 1:00:29.080]  Whether or not Hunter Biden's laptop
[1:00:29.080 --> 1:00:31.080]  Could be a point of vulnerability
[1:00:31.080 --> 1:00:34.080]  Allowing America's enemies to huntry
[1:00:34.080 --> 1:00:36.080]  Sir, the FBI cyber program
[1:00:36.080 --> 1:00:39.080]  Is based off of what's Coddle 18
[1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:41.080]  Title 18, section 1030
[1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:44.080]  A code which talks about computer intrusions
[1:00:44.080 --> 1:00:46.080]  Using nefarious intent
[1:00:46.080 --> 1:00:48.080]  You've talked about password
[1:00:48.080 --> 1:00:49.080]  Hunter Biden's power
[1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:51.080]  What a powerful exchange
[1:00:51.080 --> 1:00:52.080]  With representative Matt Gaetz
[1:00:52.080 --> 1:00:54.080]  Successfully enters Hunter Biden's laptop
[1:00:54.080 --> 1:00:55.080]  In the congressional record
[1:00:55.080 --> 1:00:58.080]  Massive persecution of the January 6
[1:00:58.080 --> 1:01:00.080]  People most of which were totally peaceful
[1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:02.080]  Many of them still held in solitary confinement
[1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:04.080]  Freedom convoy folks held in solitary confinement
[1:01:04.080 --> 1:01:06.080]  Without even being able to see lawyers
[1:01:06.080 --> 1:01:08.080]  A month in this is so dangerous
[1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:10.080]  Where is this Hunter Biden laptop situation going?
[1:01:10.080 --> 1:01:11.080]  Because we knew what was going on
[1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:13.080]  A year and a half ago in the election
[1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:15.080]  Then they censored it and shut it down
[1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:19.080]  And now it's all proven that he was basically a Chinese spy
[1:01:19.080 --> 1:01:21.080]  Well, the Hunter Biden laptop
[1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:23.080]  All of the contents have been entered
[1:01:23.080 --> 1:01:25.080]  In the congressional record
[1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:27.080]  Thanks to my great colleague from Florida there
[1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:31.080]  Matt Gaetz, that was incredible work on his part
[1:01:31.080 --> 1:01:33.080]  And so, you know what I look forward to Alex
[1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:35.080]  I look forward to taking back the House
[1:01:35.080 --> 1:01:37.080]  Republicans having control
[1:01:37.080 --> 1:01:39.080]  And we are going to investigate
[1:01:39.080 --> 1:01:41.080]  And go after every single thing
[1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:42.080]  These people have done
[1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:44.080]  You know, Hunter Biden is the most interesting thing
[1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:47.080]  That I really look forward to looking into
[1:01:47.080 --> 1:01:50.080]  And you can find proof of it on his laptop
[1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:55.080]  Is that there is funding into Biolabs in Ukraine
[1:01:55.080 --> 1:01:58.080]  And, you know, not only was Hunter Biden
[1:01:58.080 --> 1:02:01.080]  Investing in energy companies in Ukraine
[1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:04.080]  And China and his father or president
[1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:07.080]  Was involved in his uncle and who knows who else
[1:02:07.080 --> 1:02:10.080]  But also they were investing in Biolabs
[1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:13.080]  And it's so interesting that they were doing that
[1:02:13.080 --> 1:02:17.080]  And then here our country was crippled
[1:02:17.080 --> 1:02:21.080]  By a man made virus COVID-19 from the Wuhan lab
[1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:25.080]  And these are the things that we have got to dig deeply into
[1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:27.080]  And I'm just so proud of Matt
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:29.080]  He did such a good job by doing that
[1:02:29.080 --> 1:02:32.080]  And entering Hunter's laptop and all the contents
[1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:34.080]  Into the congressional record
[1:02:34.080 --> 1:02:36.080]  Because now it's wide open
[1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:38.080]  And we can go after every single bit of it
[1:02:38.080 --> 1:02:41.080]  Congresswoman, the theme I get from you is courage
[1:02:41.080 --> 1:02:43.080]  And you talk a lot about this, but you have it
[1:02:43.080 --> 1:02:45.080]  Matt Gaetz has it, DeSantis has it
[1:02:45.080 --> 1:02:47.080]  Trump has had it to a certain extent
[1:02:47.080 --> 1:02:49.080]  I want to see other conservatives
[1:02:49.080 --> 1:02:51.080]  And populace and nationalist leaders get that
[1:02:51.080 --> 1:02:54.080]  Being attacked by the New York Times and CNN is good
[1:02:54.080 --> 1:02:57.080]  And stop cowering and bowling to Hollywood
[1:02:57.080 --> 1:02:58.080]  They're a paper tiger
[1:02:58.080 --> 1:03:01.080]  And I think that's the biggest thing is to stop being scared
[1:03:01.080 --> 1:03:02.080]  Like, you're not scared to come on here
[1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:04.080]  They demonize you, people love you more
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:05.080]  Because it's all true
[1:03:05.080 --> 1:03:08.080]  And we need to let this hoax, this spell run under
[1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:10.080]  Break and have some courage
[1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:13.080]  Oh, Alex, I would never be afraid to come on your show
[1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:15.080]  I think your show is one of the best shows there is
[1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:17.080]  And the American people know it
[1:03:17.080 --> 1:03:19.080]  That's why so many people watch your show
[1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:21.080]  Because you have courage
[1:03:21.080 --> 1:03:23.080]  And you're willing to talk about things
[1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:25.080]  And explore the issues and ask questions
[1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:28.080]  There is nothing wrong with asking questions
[1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:30.080]  And digging for the truth
[1:03:30.080 --> 1:03:32.080]  That's what every single American should do
[1:03:32.080 --> 1:03:35.080]  And that's what every single member of Congress should do
[1:03:35.080 --> 1:03:38.080]  Whether the New York Times or CNN or MSNBC
[1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:41.080]  Or whoever doesn't like it too bad
[1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:43.080]  It is our job to do that
[1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:45.080]  And it's our job to represent the people
[1:03:45.080 --> 1:03:47.080]  We don't represent Hollywood
[1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:49.080]  We don't represent the media
[1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:51.080]  We don't represent the special interests
[1:03:51.080 --> 1:03:54.080]  And we sure as heck don't represent some foreign country
[1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:56.080]  We represent the American people
[1:03:56.080 --> 1:03:58.080]  And yes, I wish we had more courage here
[1:03:58.080 --> 1:04:00.080]  In Washington, D.C.
[1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:03.080]  But unfortunately, we don't see that much
[1:04:03.080 --> 1:04:06.080]  But that's why we also have to challenge one another
[1:04:06.080 --> 1:04:09.080]  I never mind challenging my own party
[1:04:09.080 --> 1:04:11.080]  In the same way I would challenge Democrats
[1:04:11.080 --> 1:04:14.080]  Because I want my Republican party
[1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:16.080]  To be the party that saves this country
[1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:19.080]  I want Republicans to do a good job
[1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:22.080]  And I think that many of them that have been here so long
[1:04:22.080 --> 1:04:25.080]  Maybe have lost sight of how to do that
[1:04:25.080 --> 1:04:28.080]  Or for whatever reasons won't do it
[1:04:28.080 --> 1:04:31.080]  But I really want to see Republicans do a good job
[1:04:31.080 --> 1:04:34.080]  And I want to see Republicans to be the party
[1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:37.080]  That stops this globalization
[1:04:37.080 --> 1:04:40.080]  That we are rapidly becoming part of
[1:04:40.080 --> 1:04:42.080]  Because Joe Biden wants a new world order
[1:04:42.080 --> 1:04:44.080]  And so do most of the Democrats
[1:04:44.080 --> 1:04:47.080]  But I think it's our responsibility to stop the new world order
[1:04:47.080 --> 1:04:49.080]  Absolutely, and everybody should support you
[1:04:49.080 --> 1:04:52.080]  MTG for America on Getter and so much more
[1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:54.080]  God bless you and have a great week
[1:04:54.080 --> 1:04:56.080]  Thank you so much, Congresswoman
[1:04:56.080 --> 1:05:00.080]  In December of 2021
[1:05:00.080 --> 1:05:03.080]  Info Wars offered the first in a three-part series
[1:05:03.080 --> 1:05:07.080]  The 1776 Anti-Tyrant Coin
[1:05:07.080 --> 1:05:09.080]  And it sold out in 10 days
[1:05:09.080 --> 1:05:12.080]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original
[1:05:12.080 --> 1:05:15.080]  Powerful coin, a founding member coin
[1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:17.080]  We would not be on air today
[1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:20.080]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin
[1:05:20.080 --> 1:05:23.080]  Is being offered and it will probably sell out
[1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:26.080]  In 10 days again, it certainly needs to
[1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:29.080]  The front of operation, it is so historic
[1:05:29.080 --> 1:05:31.080]  And it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson
[1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:33.080]  About the Tree of Liberty being refreshed
[1:05:33.080 --> 1:05:36.080]  With the blood of Patriots and Tyrants and more
[1:05:36.080 --> 1:05:40.080]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com
[1:05:40.080 --> 1:05:42.080]  It's also at infowarstore.com
[1:05:42.080 --> 1:05:45.080]  It's amazing, there's only 10,000 of them
[1:05:45.080 --> 1:05:48.080]  And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air
[1:05:48.080 --> 1:05:51.080]  We're planning something very, very special for everyone
[1:05:51.080 --> 1:05:53.080]  That helps us go to the next level
[1:05:53.080 --> 1:05:55.080]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can
[1:05:55.080 --> 1:06:24.080]  At 1776coin.com
[1:06:25.080 --> 1:06:42.080]  All right, we got one of my favorite guests
[1:06:42.080 --> 1:06:45.080]  Dr. Zelinko joining us to cover the waterfront
[1:06:45.080 --> 1:06:48.080]  Boy, the post-COVID thing is proven mass death
[1:06:48.080 --> 1:06:54.080]  Mass cancer, HIV, vaccine induced
[1:06:54.080 --> 1:07:00.080]  AIDS, I mean, we cannot stop talking about this
[1:07:00.080 --> 1:07:02.080]  While we're being diverted with the Ukraine war
[1:07:02.080 --> 1:07:04.080]  And all the other huge news that's unfolding
[1:07:04.080 --> 1:07:06.080]  But let me do this right now
[1:07:06.080 --> 1:07:09.080]  Because there is a lot we need to get to
[1:07:09.080 --> 1:07:12.080]  And get to pronto
[1:07:12.080 --> 1:07:14.080]  Let me just hit some of what we're going to be covering
[1:07:14.080 --> 1:07:16.080]  With Zelinko and just some of these headlines
[1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:19.080]  Now, we told you months ago with whistleblowers from China
[1:07:19.080 --> 1:07:22.080]  We told you weeks ago and then again yesterday
[1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:24.080]  With Dr. Sherry Tenpenny
[1:07:24.080 --> 1:07:26.080]  That they're hyping up hemorrhagic fever
[1:07:26.080 --> 1:07:29.080]  The Ebola class is the next lockdown
[1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:33.080]  Unaguardian woman in UK diagnosed with
[1:07:33.080 --> 1:07:36.080]  Congo hemorrhagic fever
[1:07:36.080 --> 1:07:39.080]  Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever
[1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:42.080]  Second time in history
[1:07:42.080 --> 1:07:45.080]  CDC tells New York Times it hid corona data
[1:07:45.080 --> 1:07:47.080]  For political reasons
[1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:51.080]  We already told you that, but now that's the mainstream news
[1:07:51.080 --> 1:07:54.080]  Unbelievable, there's the New York Times admitting it
[1:07:54.080 --> 1:07:57.080]  mRNA madness
[1:07:57.080 --> 1:08:00.080]  FDA authorizes both fourth and fifth COVID shots
[1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:02.080]  And now they're pushing them on children
[1:08:02.080 --> 1:08:04.080]  I mean, just incredible
[1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:07.080]  Cruise ship reports COVID-19 outbreak in San Francisco
[1:08:07.080 --> 1:08:12.080]  Everyone was certified double and triple jab to get on board
[1:08:12.080 --> 1:08:16.080]  And then there's all these clips in Australia
[1:08:16.080 --> 1:08:19.080]  Where they admit record death, record illness
[1:08:19.080 --> 1:08:22.080]  In the vaccinated confirming all of it
[1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:27.080]  And Pfizer trying to suppress all of these documents
[1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:29.080]  I mean, it's just
[1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:31.080]  They did it, they launched the attack
[1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:35.080]  They absolutely did it
[1:08:35.080 --> 1:08:39.080]  To humanity
[1:08:39.080 --> 1:08:42.080]  And some of these headlines
[1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:45.080]  Are just mind blowing when you realize
[1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:48.080]  That they actually did this to us
[1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:51.080]  They actually launched this globalist attack
[1:08:51.080 --> 1:08:53.080]  And there's articles everywhere
[1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:56.080]  Oh, younger people, older people, children
[1:08:56.080 --> 1:08:59.080]  They're now having increased heart attacks and strokes
[1:08:59.080 --> 1:09:02.080]  When it's in the insert that this does it to you
[1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:04.080]  The Pfizer-Moderna shots, but then guardian again
[1:09:04.080 --> 1:09:07.080]  Hotter nights, increased risk of death from heart disease
[1:09:07.080 --> 1:09:09.080]  For men in early 60s
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:11.080]  Suddenly record numbers in them
[1:09:11.080 --> 1:09:14.080]  And then it's the children
[1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:18.080]  Seven-year-old boy at Essex Academy, vaccinated from the shot
[1:09:18.080 --> 1:09:22.080]  With the shot
[1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:25.080]  Seven-year-old boy at Essex Academy
[1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:28.080]  School run, dies of a suspected heart attack
[1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:30.080]  During his lunch break
[1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:32.080]  Wow
[1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:35.080]  There it all is, just so incredible
[1:09:35.080 --> 1:09:37.080]  Meanwhile, still in Austria
[1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:39.080]  They tackle and beat people up
[1:09:39.080 --> 1:09:41.080]  That aren't wearing masks in public
[1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:43.080]  What a cult
[1:09:43.080 --> 1:09:46.080]  Of control
[1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:48.080]  Truly dangerous
[1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:50.080]  Truly historic
[1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:52.080]  We're living through all this
[1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:55.080]  But mainstream media gas lights everybody
[1:09:55.080 --> 1:09:57.080]  And just behaves like this is normal
[1:09:57.080 --> 1:09:59.080]  That this is no big deal
[1:09:59.080 --> 1:10:02.080]  But all of it is an assault on humanity
[1:10:02.080 --> 1:10:05.080]  And boy, you talk about an example
[1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:07.080]  Of that
[1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:10.080]  Big article up on infowords.com
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:14.080]  World-facing food shortages, not just price issues
[1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:17.080]  Top U.N. official warns that
[1:10:17.080 --> 1:10:19.080]  Hundreds of millions are on the verge of starvation
[1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:22.080]  That 200 million will starve to death if this continues
[1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:26.080]  In the next year, which is by design
[1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:29.080]  Meanwhile, food rationing, food vouchers
[1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:32.080]  And hunger will become normalized for the next war phase
[1:10:32.080 --> 1:10:34.080]  Of the pandemic
[1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:38.080]  They will starve out the world to usher in the financial reset
[1:10:38.080 --> 1:10:41.080]  Of the digital identity control grid
[1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:44.080]  Which is all being announced
[1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:46.080]  And is all being set up
[1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:49.080]  U.S. households face $5,200 inflation tax
[1:10:49.080 --> 1:10:51.080]  This year, bare minimum
[1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:54.080]  And that's only from current numbers
[1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:57.080]  U.K. and World Economic Forum to lead
[1:10:57.080 --> 1:11:00.080]  Oh, the World Economic Forum is leading the government
[1:11:00.080 --> 1:11:02.080]  To lead regulation, revolution
[1:11:02.080 --> 1:11:04.080]  To foster industries of the future
[1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:07.080]  To cut carbon, which puts us into
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:10.080]  A total depression
[1:11:10.080 --> 1:11:12.080]  There's this incredible World Economic Forum clip
[1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:16.080]  Called World Government Summit, where they announce all of it
[1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:18.080]  Out in the open, in fact, get that clip, folks
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:21.080]  I didn't see it on my list, I want to play that
[1:11:21.080 --> 1:11:23.080]  Bank of England says energy prices will hit Britain
[1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:26.080]  Harder than even the 1970s inflation
[1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:29.080]  And energy crunch, yes
[1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:31.080]  Russian Foreign Minister releases alleged
[1:11:31.080 --> 1:11:34.080]  Bio-weapon timeline of U.S. bio-research in Ukraine
[1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:37.080]  And so much more
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:39.080]  And the U.K. government also
[1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:42.080]  Same thing's happening here is announcing new digital currency
[1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:45.080]  Tokens to replace the pound
[1:11:45.080 --> 1:11:47.080]  That will track where you go and what you do
[1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:49.080]  And they'll decide what you can spend it on
[1:11:49.080 --> 1:11:52.080]  And have total surveillance of you
[1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:54.080]  Folks, if you put up with this nightmare
[1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:57.080]  You deserve what happens
[1:11:57.080 --> 1:11:59.080]  110%
[1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:01.080]  And if you think it's just going to be the third world that
[1:12:01.080 --> 1:12:04.080]  Starves to Death, think again
[1:12:04.080 --> 1:12:07.080]  That's just some of the news and information
[1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:09.080]  We've got to break down today
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:11.080]  Dr. Lenko is going to be covering this
[1:12:11.080 --> 1:12:14.080]  And VADES, which even
[1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:17.080]  Mainline Science is admitting is exploding
[1:12:17.080 --> 1:12:20.080]  Vaccine-induced AIDS
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:22.080]  That is coming up, we're going to tie it all together
[1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:24.080]  You know, I made jokes years ago
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:26.080]  That they're going to ban the letter W
[1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:28.080]  Because it starts with white
[1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:31.080]  Or you could use it spelling the word white
[1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:33.080]  They've already banned MOGs
[1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:35.080]  You name it, of OK symbol
[1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:37.080]  Well, now in Germany they arrest you
[1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:40.080]  If you have the letter Z anywhere where it can be seen
[1:12:40.080 --> 1:12:42.080]  It is now a hate symbol
[1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:44.080]  And a bunch of governmental institutions
[1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:47.080]  And websites are now banning the word Z
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:50.080]  As well, this is a direct attack on reality
[1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:52.080]  And on communication and creating a bunch of
[1:12:52.080 --> 1:12:55.080]  Superstitious brainwashed, dumbed down idiots
[1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:58.080]  That are basically been completely sabotaged
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:03.080]  Into the whole leftist, globalist, behavioral psychology operation
[1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:05.080]  That will end up destroying the globalists
[1:13:05.080 --> 1:13:07.080]  And the processes as well
[1:13:07.080 --> 1:13:10.080]  So it's all coming up here today
[1:13:10.080 --> 1:13:13.080]  And a lot more
[1:13:13.080 --> 1:13:16.080]  I want to encourage listeners to understand that
[1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:19.080]  Info wars is more important than it's ever been
[1:13:19.080 --> 1:13:21.080]  And we can't stay on air without your support
[1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:23.080]  And because we've gotten so lean
[1:13:23.080 --> 1:13:26.080]  And so almost unable to operate
[1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:28.080]  It's made me do a lot of accounting
[1:13:28.080 --> 1:13:29.080]  And a lot of research
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:31.080]  And a lot of looking at our business models
[1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:32.080]  And how we fund ourselves
[1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:33.080]  And we've found a lot of issues
[1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:35.080]  And most of the issues, most of the good things
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:37.080]  Are due to my crew and myself and everybody
[1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:39.080]  But a lot of the bad things are due to me
[1:13:39.080 --> 1:13:41.080]  Due to Alex Jones as well
[1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:43.080]  And a lot of that is
[1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:44.080]  Every couple of weeks I'm like
[1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:46.080]  Man, I love this t-shirt designer
[1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:49.080]  I want to design a t-shirt this way
[1:13:49.080 --> 1:13:52.080]  So I knew we had over 100 t-shirts in the last few years
[1:13:52.080 --> 1:13:53.080]  That I basically designed
[1:13:53.080 --> 1:13:54.080]  Some are amazing, some are okay
[1:13:54.080 --> 1:13:56.080]  The point is, is I designed them
[1:13:56.080 --> 1:14:00.080]  And I never promote them as you notice
[1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:02.080]  And so at infowarstore.com
[1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:06.080]  It turns out we have almost a half million dollars
[1:14:06.080 --> 1:14:08.080]  Of over 200 designs
[1:14:08.080 --> 1:14:09.080]  I thought it was over 100
[1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:11.080]  Over 200 designs
[1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:12.080]  Many of which only did one run of
[1:14:12.080 --> 1:14:14.080]  And I never talked about
[1:14:14.080 --> 1:14:16.080]  There's more than 50 great t-shirts
[1:14:16.080 --> 1:14:18.080]  I've never worn, never had
[1:14:18.080 --> 1:14:20.080]  Never promoted on the show
[1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:22.080]  That are at infowarstore.com
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:23.080]  So the good news is
[1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:25.080]  If we even sell those at cost
[1:14:25.080 --> 1:14:27.080]  That gets us a half million dollars in
[1:14:27.080 --> 1:14:29.080]  When we got about a $200, $300
[1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:30.080]  Underage every month
[1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:31.080]  To fund this independent operation
[1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:33.080]  With all the bandwidth we use
[1:14:33.080 --> 1:14:34.080]  For victims of our own success
[1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:35.080]  So I'm going to try to create
[1:14:35.080 --> 1:14:37.080]  A page at infowarstore.com
[1:14:37.080 --> 1:14:39.080]  The next few days that has the
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:41.080]  220-something shirts
[1:14:41.080 --> 1:14:43.080]  Which are all basically special edition
[1:14:43.080 --> 1:14:44.080]  In fact, I made the decision
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:46.080]  Even the old classics
[1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:49.080]  Shirts I designed 25, 26 years ago
[1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:51.080]  Like mass murderers agree, gun control works
[1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:54.080]  All of them are limited edition now
[1:14:54.080 --> 1:14:56.080]  And it's the last run of all of these
[1:14:56.080 --> 1:14:58.080]  Shirts, ball caps, everything
[1:14:58.080 --> 1:14:59.080]  In the future, we're going to have
[1:14:59.080 --> 1:15:01.080]  Limited editions for like a month or two
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:03.080]  Of one or two shirts and that's it
[1:15:03.080 --> 1:15:04.080]  That's how you're supposed to do it
[1:15:04.080 --> 1:15:06.080]  To fund your operation and get the word out
[1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:09.080]  So if you want these limited edition
[1:15:09.080 --> 1:15:11.080]  And help keep us on air and get them at cost
[1:15:11.080 --> 1:15:13.080]  Almost all of them are set at cost
[1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:14.080]  If they aren't, we're having them set at that
[1:15:14.080 --> 1:15:16.080]  Go to infowarstore.com
[1:15:16.080 --> 1:15:18.080]  And get some of these amazing t-shirts
[1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:20.080]  A lot of them are designer, some of them
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:21.080]  Are just, you know, plain james
[1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:23.080]  They'll have great messages, ball caps
[1:15:23.080 --> 1:15:26.080]  Free American shirts, wake-up shirts
[1:15:26.080 --> 1:15:29.080]  A Ralph Fauci shirts, Alex Jones' right shirts

[1:15:31.080 --> 1:15:33.080]  And then that's it, we're never going to
[1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:35.080]  Make any of these again, all of them
[1:15:35.080 --> 1:15:37.080]  Are limited edition, every one of these
[1:15:37.080 --> 1:15:39.080]  Shirts, even though some of them are staples
[1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:41.080]  We're never going to offer again

[1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:00.080]  When I say it, it's just true
[1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:03.080]  That info wars is seen by the globalist
[1:17:03.080 --> 1:17:05.080]  As the standard of human liberty
[1:17:05.080 --> 1:17:10.080]  As the logo of human populist resistance
[1:17:10.080 --> 1:17:13.080]  Against their transhumanist anti-human program
[1:17:13.080 --> 1:17:17.080]  And man, our work is really right now
[1:17:17.080 --> 1:17:20.080]  Hitting the most important aspects
[1:17:20.080 --> 1:17:21.080]  Of what we've ever done
[1:17:21.080 --> 1:17:24.080]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize

[1:20:01.080 --> 1:20:03.080]  Of the New World Order
[1:20:03.080 --> 1:20:05.080]  It's Alex Jones
[1:20:17.080 --> 1:20:20.080]  Well, there have been a lot of champions
[1:20:20.080 --> 1:20:24.080]  A lot of great men and women in the last 25, 26 months
[1:20:24.080 --> 1:20:26.080]  That have really exposed the evil
[1:20:26.080 --> 1:20:28.080]  That was this giant depopulation operation
[1:20:28.080 --> 1:20:30.080]  That we're still in the middle of
[1:20:30.080 --> 1:20:32.080]  But because so many people got woken
[1:20:32.080 --> 1:20:33.080]  What was happening, they kind of
[1:20:33.080 --> 1:20:35.080]  Partially pulled back their attack
[1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:36.080]  They're offensive
[1:20:36.080 --> 1:20:37.080]  But out of all of them
[1:20:37.080 --> 1:20:40.080]  Dr. Zelinko has been
[1:20:40.080 --> 1:20:44.080]  The most informative and the most accurate
[1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:46.080]  Dr. Vitamir Zebselinko is here with us
[1:20:46.080 --> 1:20:47.080]  He's a medical doctor
[1:20:47.080 --> 1:20:49.080]  Of course, the pioneered treatments that saved
[1:20:49.080 --> 1:20:51.080]  Tens of thousands of lives in New York
[1:20:51.080 --> 1:20:54.080]  And his patients that then helped trigger
[1:20:54.080 --> 1:20:58.080]  Really a therapeutic revolution of research
[1:20:58.080 --> 1:21:00.080]  That the entire power structure tried to block
[1:21:00.080 --> 1:21:03.080]  And I wanted him to come on today
[1:21:03.080 --> 1:21:05.080]  And just talk about how he was right
[1:21:05.080 --> 1:21:07.080]  So he could then tell us about what he thinks
[1:21:07.080 --> 1:21:08.080]  Is coming in the future
[1:21:08.080 --> 1:21:10.080]  And he said, yeah, let's not get into me being right
[1:21:10.080 --> 1:21:12.080]  Everybody knows what he's witnessed here
[1:21:12.080 --> 1:21:14.080]  Let's move on to the big picture of transhumanism
[1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:17.080]  And some of the world economic foreign people
[1:21:17.080 --> 1:21:19.080]  Are promoting statements like
[1:21:19.080 --> 1:21:20.080]  Why do we need so many people?
[1:21:20.080 --> 1:21:21.080]  We're about to become gods
[1:21:21.080 --> 1:21:22.080]  Let's get rid of everyone
[1:21:22.080 --> 1:21:25.080]  I mean, really evil, sinister stuff
[1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:27.080]  That you'd imagine you'd see in like a
[1:21:27.080 --> 1:21:29.080]  Marvel comic supervillain
[1:21:29.080 --> 1:21:31.080]  But it's actually coming out of the globalist operation
[1:21:31.080 --> 1:21:33.080]  So I'm glad he wants to get to that
[1:21:33.080 --> 1:21:34.080]  Because I want his take on it
[1:21:34.080 --> 1:21:35.080]  That was actually on my list of topics
[1:21:35.080 --> 1:21:37.080]  So, sir, great to have you with us
[1:21:37.080 --> 1:21:40.080]  Dr. Zelinko, please try to cut to the heart of it
[1:21:40.080 --> 1:21:41.080]  As you said you wanted to during the break
[1:21:41.080 --> 1:21:43.080]  When we talked
[1:21:43.080 --> 1:21:45.080]  Thanks Alex, thanks for having me
[1:21:45.080 --> 1:21:50.080]  So the enemy is godless
[1:21:50.080 --> 1:21:53.080]  Doesn't believe in an afterlife
[1:21:53.080 --> 1:21:56.080]  But they don't want to die
[1:21:56.080 --> 1:21:59.080]  And if you ask them what happens to consciousness
[1:21:59.080 --> 1:22:03.080]  After you die, they say it just ceases to be
[1:22:03.080 --> 1:22:06.080]  And so what they're trying to do
[1:22:06.080 --> 1:22:08.080]  For the last 30 years
[1:22:08.080 --> 1:22:12.080]  Is to create a way to escape death
[1:22:12.080 --> 1:22:13.080]  I know it sounds weird
[1:22:13.080 --> 1:22:15.080]  But that's exactly what they're trying to do
[1:22:15.080 --> 1:22:17.080]  I don't think they'll succeed
[1:22:17.080 --> 1:22:20.080]  But we need to understand the motivations of the enemies
[1:22:20.080 --> 1:22:22.080]  So that we can have a rational
[1:22:22.080 --> 1:22:24.080]  And good strategic response
[1:22:24.080 --> 1:22:28.080]  And so if you listen to people like Ray Kurzweil
[1:22:28.080 --> 1:22:31.080]  And someone else whose name is Yuval Noah Harari
[1:22:31.080 --> 1:22:33.080]  Which we'll talk about more in a minute
[1:22:33.080 --> 1:22:35.080]  What they're trying to do is create
[1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:39.080]  An inorganic, organic platform
[1:22:39.080 --> 1:22:42.080]  Humanoid platform
[1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:44.080]  That has artificial intelligence
[1:22:44.080 --> 1:22:46.080]  Where human consciousness could
[1:22:46.080 --> 1:22:48.080]  Literally be downloaded into
[1:22:48.080 --> 1:22:52.080]  And so the self-proclaimed elites
[1:22:52.080 --> 1:22:55.080]  Will then have a platform for eternal life
[1:22:55.080 --> 1:22:57.080]  And because they have a problem
[1:22:57.080 --> 1:22:59.080]  That the physical body that we live in
[1:22:59.080 --> 1:23:02.080]  Only has a limited lifespan
[1:23:02.080 --> 1:23:04.080]  50 years, 100 years, whatever it is
[1:23:04.080 --> 1:23:05.080]  It's finite
[1:23:05.080 --> 1:23:07.080]  And so when this body begins to fail
[1:23:07.080 --> 1:23:10.080]  They want to be able to trans-download
[1:23:10.080 --> 1:23:12.080]  And transfer their consciousness
[1:23:12.080 --> 1:23:14.080]  Into a humanoid platform
[1:23:14.080 --> 1:23:16.080]  And then eventually, over time
[1:23:16.080 --> 1:23:18.080]  Into other humanoid platforms
[1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:20.080]  Upgrade, so to speak
[1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:23.080]  Now, this is exactly what their agenda is
[1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:26.080]  Because they know that
[1:23:26.080 --> 1:23:28.080]  Or they believe, at least, that
[1:23:28.080 --> 1:23:29.080]  If they were to die
[1:23:29.080 --> 1:23:31.080]  That they would cease to be
[1:23:31.080 --> 1:23:35.080]  Now, in that world view
[1:23:35.080 --> 1:23:37.080]  They are prepared to waste
[1:23:37.080 --> 1:23:39.080]  6.5 billion people
[1:23:39.080 --> 1:23:42.080]  Because it's completely unnecessary
[1:23:42.080 --> 1:23:43.080]  Useful as eaters
[1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:46.080]  And they don't need that many slaves
[1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:50.080]  And so what this vaccine platform has been
[1:23:50.080 --> 1:23:52.080]  These vaccines do a lot of things
[1:23:52.080 --> 1:23:55.080]  Except one thing, prevent COVID-19
[1:23:55.080 --> 1:23:57.080]  There are three simultaneous
[1:23:57.080 --> 1:24:00.080]  Agenda capabilities that these vaccines do
[1:24:00.080 --> 1:24:02.080]  One is population control
[1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:07.080]  And that's done through four different
[1:24:07.080 --> 1:24:08.080]  Phenomenon
[1:24:08.080 --> 1:24:10.080]  A percentage of people die
[1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:14.080]  Relatively soon after getting injected
[1:24:14.080 --> 1:24:17.080]  Long-term life spans are being reduced
[1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:19.080]  Because of chronic diseases
[1:24:19.080 --> 1:24:21.080]  Such as cancer and autoimmune diseases
[1:24:21.080 --> 1:24:23.080]  There's miscarriage rates
[1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:26.080]  That are skyrocketing from 10 to 82%
[1:24:26.080 --> 1:24:28.080]  And actually, recent DoD data
[1:24:28.080 --> 1:24:29.080]  Department of Defense data
[1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:31.080]  Say, over 300%
[1:24:31.080 --> 1:24:33.080]  And then there's infertility
[1:24:33.080 --> 1:24:35.080]  All this was predicted by the FDA
[1:24:35.080 --> 1:24:37.080]  In October 2020
[1:24:37.080 --> 1:24:41.080]  This was not an accidental finding
[1:24:41.080 --> 1:24:45.080]  This was a premeditated plan
[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:48.080]  Proven by the fact that the FDA
[1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:50.080]  Reported that this was going to happen
[1:24:50.080 --> 1:24:54.080]  To its scientists two months prior to the rollout
[1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:57.080]  And now we have 15 months of data that corroborates
[1:24:57.080 --> 1:25:02.080]  Number two, there is an enslavement component here
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:04.080]  Control mechanism
[1:25:04.080 --> 1:25:08.080]  A 24-7 surveillance component
[1:25:08.080 --> 1:25:11.080]  About bringing the ability to measure
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:13.080]  Biometric data under the skin
[1:25:13.080 --> 1:25:15.080]  And then transmit that data to a third party
[1:25:15.080 --> 1:25:16.080]  With your location
[1:25:16.080 --> 1:25:20.080]  And then the linkage of that to cryptocurrency
[1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:24.080]  Which in 2026, according to congressional data
[1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:26.080]  When Medicare begins to fail
[1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:30.080]  And the world economy has become unstable
[1:25:30.080 --> 1:25:33.080]  There will be an inevitable crisis go to waste
[1:25:33.080 --> 1:25:37.080]  There will be a transition from
[1:25:37.080 --> 1:25:40.080]  The current economic system to a one-world
[1:25:40.080 --> 1:25:43.080]  Cryptocurrency-based financial system
[1:25:43.080 --> 1:25:45.080]  Which will then create a mechanism
[1:25:45.080 --> 1:25:47.080]  For control of human behavior
[1:25:47.080 --> 1:25:51.080]  Because if the powers that be
[1:25:51.080 --> 1:25:53.080]  That could control the system don't like you
[1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:55.080]  They just turn off your ability to buy bread
[1:25:55.080 --> 1:25:56.080]  For your family
[1:25:56.080 --> 1:26:00.080]  And then the third most sinister component to this
[1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:03.080]  Is the transhumanist component
[1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:07.080]  Or the ability to hack into your genetic code
[1:26:07.080 --> 1:26:10.080]  Using an mRNA platform to deliver
[1:26:10.080 --> 1:26:13.080]  CRISPR-Cas9 technology
[1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:15.080]  And gene-edit U
[1:26:15.080 --> 1:26:17.080]  So that you no longer made an image of God
[1:26:17.080 --> 1:26:21.080]  But you made an image of Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates
[1:26:21.080 --> 1:26:23.080]  They're literally going to re-engineer
[1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:24.080]  What it means to be human
[1:26:24.080 --> 1:26:26.080]  And so this you will know of Harari
[1:26:26.080 --> 1:26:33.080]  Is a wayward Jew from Israel
[1:26:33.080 --> 1:26:37.080]  Professor of history at Hebrew University
[1:26:37.080 --> 1:26:39.080]  And he's called the prophet
[1:26:39.080 --> 1:26:43.080]  By people like Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates
[1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:45.080]  They call him basically their high priest
[1:26:45.080 --> 1:26:47.080]  And he says stuff that quite frankly
[1:26:47.080 --> 1:26:49.080]  Sounds like he came out of the mouth of Hitler
[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:51.080]  Like we don't need most people
[1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:52.080]  We're about to become gods
[1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:54.080]  This is dangerous
[1:26:54.080 --> 1:26:57.080]  And Obama called him his favorite author in CNN
[1:26:57.080 --> 1:26:59.080]  And so what does this guy say?
[1:26:59.080 --> 1:27:04.080]  Well, he says that humans are hackable animals
[1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:07.080]  And since we can hack into your genetic code
[1:27:07.080 --> 1:27:10.080]  We could re-engineer it with intelligent design
[1:27:10.080 --> 1:27:12.080]  But not with some God
[1:27:12.080 --> 1:27:15.080]  About the Klaus intelligent design
[1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:18.080]  But rather by human intelligent design
[1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:21.080]  Because we are now like gods
[1:27:21.080 --> 1:27:23.080]  There's no such thing as a soul
[1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:25.080]  There's no such thing as free will
[1:27:25.080 --> 1:27:28.080]  These are just some of the tidbits of what this guy
[1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:31.080]  This is literally Genesis out of the
[1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:33.080]  One of the oldest Jewish books
[1:27:33.080 --> 1:27:35.080]  Telling us the serpent said it
[1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:37.080]  And now he's saying it right now
[1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:39.080]  Well, he is a serpent
[1:27:39.080 --> 1:27:41.080]  He's the embodiment of the serpent
[1:27:41.080 --> 1:27:45.080]  And it's very actually relieving to me
[1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:48.080]  That the enemy has finally exposed himself
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:50.080]  Because he's just one little man
[1:27:50.080 --> 1:27:52.080]  But he represents an ideology
[1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:55.080]  That we have allowed to exist
[1:27:55.080 --> 1:27:57.080]  Through the godless vacuum
[1:27:57.080 --> 1:27:59.080]  That we have created in the world
[1:27:59.080 --> 1:28:00.080]  In society
[1:28:00.080 --> 1:28:03.080]  He is the inevitable outcome
[1:28:03.080 --> 1:28:06.080]  Of a society that has allowed
[1:28:06.080 --> 1:28:09.080]  For the desecration of the sanctity of life
[1:28:09.080 --> 1:28:12.080]  The sanctity of marriage and the sanctity of gender
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:15.080]  You're saying we conjured him by our sin?
[1:28:17.080 --> 1:28:21.080]  We allowed for darkness to exist
[1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:24.080]  If we do not bring light into the world
[1:28:24.080 --> 1:28:25.080]  Powerful, stay there
[1:28:25.080 --> 1:28:26.080]  I want to get into this
[1:28:26.080 --> 1:28:28.080]  Because I watch his whole speeches
[1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:30.080]  And they're so satanic it makes your head spin
[1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:33.080]  And there's Klaus Schwab drooling while he speaks
[1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:36.080]  And so they definitely worship this guy
[1:28:36.080 --> 1:28:38.080]  And we're going to talk about what he believes
[1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:40.080]  On the other side with Dr. Zelenko
[1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:41.080]  This is so important
[1:28:41.080 --> 1:28:43.080]  You can find Dr. Zelenko's site on screen
[1:28:43.080 --> 1:28:46.080]  When we come back we'll tell you about that as well
[1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:48.080]  This is an incredible time
[1:28:48.080 --> 1:28:50.080]  Everything is coming to a head ladies and gentlemen
[1:28:50.080 --> 1:28:52.080]  This is the battle of the gods
[1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:53.080]  Whatever you want to call it
[1:28:53.080 --> 1:28:54.080]  It's happening
[1:28:57.080 --> 1:28:59.080]  In December of 2021
[1:28:59.080 --> 1:29:02.080]  Info Wars offered the first in a three part series
[1:29:02.080 --> 1:29:06.080]  The 1776 anti-tyrant coin
[1:29:06.080 --> 1:29:08.080]  And it sold out in 10 days
[1:29:08.080 --> 1:29:10.080]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this
[1:29:10.080 --> 1:29:12.080]  Original, powerful coin
[1:29:12.080 --> 1:29:13.080]  A founding member coin
[1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:16.080]  We would not be on air today
[1:29:16.080 --> 1:29:18.080]  Now the second coin
[1:29:18.080 --> 1:29:21.080]  The Liberty Tree coin is being offered
[1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:24.080]  And it will probably sell out in 10 days again
[1:29:24.080 --> 1:29:25.080]  It certainly needs to
[1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:26.080]  The front of operation
[1:29:26.080 --> 1:29:28.080]  It is so historic
[1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:30.080]  And it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson
[1:29:30.080 --> 1:29:32.080]  About the Tree of Liberty being refreshed
[1:29:32.080 --> 1:29:35.080]  With the blood of Patriots and Tyrants and more
[1:29:35.080 --> 1:29:39.080]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com
[1:29:39.080 --> 1:29:41.080]  It's also at infowarstore.com
[1:29:41.080 --> 1:29:42.080]  It's amazing
[1:29:42.080 --> 1:29:44.080]  There's only 10,000 of them
[1:29:44.080 --> 1:29:45.080]  And as a founding member
[1:29:45.080 --> 1:29:47.080]  If we're able to stay on the air
[1:29:47.080 --> 1:29:50.080]  We're planning something very, very special for everyone
[1:29:50.080 --> 1:29:52.080]  That helps us go to the next level
[1:29:52.080 --> 1:29:54.080]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin
[1:29:54.080 --> 1:29:57.080]  While you still can at 1776coin.com
[1:29:57.080 --> 1:30:00.080]  We are only offering three coins in the series
[1:30:00.080 --> 1:30:04.080]  The first coin was released in December of 2021
[1:30:04.080 --> 1:30:05.080]  And sold out in 10 days
[1:30:05.080 --> 1:30:07.080]  Now the second coin
[1:30:07.080 --> 1:30:10.080]  As we enter the last days of March into April
[1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:13.080]  2022 is now being offered
[1:30:13.080 --> 1:30:16.080]  And I believe it will sell out in just a few days again
[1:30:16.080 --> 1:30:18.080]  Because these are historic coins
[1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:21.080]  And because our amazing listeners want to support freedom
[1:30:21.080 --> 1:30:23.080]  And keep info wars at the front lines
[1:30:23.080 --> 1:30:25.080]  Of the fight against these tyrants
[1:30:25.080 --> 1:30:29.080]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com
[1:30:29.080 --> 1:30:32.080]  And see the new Liberty Tree coin
[1:30:32.080 --> 1:30:34.080]  It is powerful
[1:30:34.080 --> 1:30:37.080]  Witness this powerful iconography for yourself
[1:30:37.080 --> 1:30:39.080]  And have this piece of history
[1:30:39.080 --> 1:30:42.080]  And be part of the founding member system
[1:30:42.080 --> 1:30:45.080]  That we're set to launch in the very near future
[1:30:45.080 --> 1:30:48.080]  Thanks to your support of this project
[1:30:48.080 --> 1:30:50.080]  Get a historic memento
[1:30:50.080 --> 1:30:52.080]  That helps keep info wars on the air
[1:30:52.080 --> 1:30:55.080]  And also gives you a real piece of history
[1:30:55.080 --> 1:31:23.080]  1776coin.com
[1:31:25.080 --> 1:31:27.080]  All the things we've got to bring into our bodies
[1:31:27.080 --> 1:31:29.080]  To change who we are
[1:31:29.080 --> 1:31:31.080]  Are only lowering us
[1:31:31.080 --> 1:31:32.080]  They're only making us more depressed
[1:31:32.080 --> 1:31:34.080]  From the end they're only making us less filled
[1:31:34.080 --> 1:31:36.080]  It is only by going within
[1:31:36.080 --> 1:31:38.080]  And really making that connection to God
[1:31:38.080 --> 1:31:40.080]  That we can truly empower ourselves
[1:31:40.080 --> 1:31:42.080]  That's why the globe was bombarded
[1:31:42.080 --> 1:31:43.080]  With toxins and chemicals
[1:31:43.080 --> 1:31:46.080]  To block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals
[1:31:46.080 --> 1:31:49.080]  And trace elements our bodies need to be healthy
[1:31:49.080 --> 1:31:51.080]  And to be able to basically reach out
[1:31:51.080 --> 1:31:53.080]  Beyond the third dimension
[1:31:53.080 --> 1:31:55.080]  And that's where the incredible products come in
[1:31:55.080 --> 1:32:23.080]  Thanks for watching
[1:32:23.080 --> 1:32:25.080]  We'll see you in the next video
[1:32:54.080 --> 1:32:58.080]  So get yours at m4store.com today
[1:32:58.080 --> 1:33:01.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[1:33:01.080 --> 1:33:03.080]  Of the New World Order
[1:33:03.080 --> 1:33:30.080]  It's Alex Jones
[1:33:30.080 --> 1:33:33.080]  Paul Delaharie is the high priest
[1:33:33.080 --> 1:33:35.080]  They call him the leader
[1:33:35.080 --> 1:33:37.080]  The prophet of Klaus Schwab
[1:33:37.080 --> 1:33:39.080]  They just fall over themselves
[1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:41.080]  I've watched a video of Hollywood
[1:33:41.080 --> 1:33:43.080]  And Schwab that just grobbled him
[1:33:43.080 --> 1:33:45.080]  And he says to her and tells them
[1:33:45.080 --> 1:33:47.080]  Why do we need so many people?
[1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:48.080]  Why do we need all this?
[1:33:48.080 --> 1:33:50.080]  And this is the transhumanist cult
[1:33:50.080 --> 1:33:52.080]  Everything they're doing is coming out of this plan
[1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:54.080]  Here's just a few of the clips
[1:33:54.080 --> 1:33:56.080]  You can't do it justice
[1:33:56.080 --> 1:33:58.080]  Everything he says is just so frickin' evil
[1:33:58.080 --> 1:34:01.080]  And then the big political and economic question
[1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:04.080]  Of the 21st century will be
[1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:06.080]  What do we need humans for?
[1:34:06.080 --> 1:34:09.080]  Or at least what do we need so many humans for?
[1:34:09.080 --> 1:34:11.080]  Do you have an answer in the book?
[1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:14.080]  At present the best guess we have
[1:34:14.080 --> 1:34:18.080]  Is keep them happy with drugs and computer games
[1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:20.080]  We call this the metaverse
[1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:22.080]  What you guys do in here?
[1:34:22.080 --> 1:34:24.080]  Pretty much everything that you were doing in the real world
[1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:27.080]  Or at least what do we need so many humans for?
[1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:30.080]  Would constitute a new useless class
[1:34:30.080 --> 1:34:33.080]  When I say that these are useless humans
[1:34:33.080 --> 1:34:35.080]  It's not from the viewpoint of the mother
[1:34:35.080 --> 1:34:38.080]  Of the wife of the son
[1:34:38.080 --> 1:34:41.080]  Or at least what do we need so many humans for?
[1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:43.080]  First we've got population
[1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:46.080]  Now the world today has 6.8 billion people
[1:34:46.080 --> 1:34:48.080]  That's headed up to about 9 billion
[1:34:48.080 --> 1:34:51.080]  Now if we do a really great job
[1:34:51.080 --> 1:34:55.080]  On new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services
[1:34:55.080 --> 1:34:58.080]  We could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent
[1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:01.080]  Or at least what do we need so many humans for?
[1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:03.080]  Forget the conspiracy
[1:35:03.080 --> 1:35:04.080]  Listen to our government agencies
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:06.080]  These guys are telling the truth
[1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:08.080]  You know there's no conspiracy here folks
[1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:10.080]  Just get your damn vaccine
[1:35:10.080 --> 1:35:12.080]  Alright, thank you doctor
[1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:14.080]  And COVID is critical
[1:35:14.080 --> 1:35:17.080]  Because this is what convinces people
[1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:20.080]  To accept, to legitimize
[1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:23.080]  Total biometric surveillance
[1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:25.080]  If we want to stop this epidemic
[1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:28.080]  We need not just to monitor people
[1:35:28.080 --> 1:35:32.080]  We need to monitor what's happening under their skin
[1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:34.080]  What we've seen so far
[1:35:34.080 --> 1:35:37.080]  It's corporations and governments collecting data
[1:35:37.080 --> 1:35:41.080]  About where we go, who we meet, what movies we watch
[1:35:41.080 --> 1:35:47.080]  The next phase is the surveillance going under our skin
[1:35:47.080 --> 1:35:50.080]  We now see mass surveillance systems
[1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:53.080]  Established even in democratic countries
[1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:55.080]  Which previously rejected them
[1:35:55.080 --> 1:35:59.080]  And we also see a change in the nature of surveillance
[1:35:59.080 --> 1:36:03.080]  Previously surveillance was mainly above the skin
[1:36:03.080 --> 1:36:06.080]  Now it's going under the skin
[1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:08.080]  Governments want to know
[1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:10.080]  Not just where we go or who we meet
[1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:12.080]  Above all they want to know
[1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:14.080]  What is happening under our skin
[1:36:14.080 --> 1:36:16.080]  What's our body temperature
[1:36:16.080 --> 1:36:18.080]  What's our blood pressure
[1:36:18.080 --> 1:36:20.080]  What is our medical condition
[1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:26.080]  Now humans are developing even bigger powers
[1:36:26.080 --> 1:36:28.080]  Than ever before
[1:36:28.080 --> 1:36:31.080]  We are really acquiring divine powers
[1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:33.080]  Of creation and destruction
[1:36:33.080 --> 1:36:36.080]  We are really upgrading humans into gods
[1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:40.080]  We are acquiring, for instance, the power to re-engineer life
[1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:44.080]  Humans are now hackable animals
[1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:50.080]  The whole idea that humans have this soul or spirit
[1:36:50.080 --> 1:36:52.080]  And they have free will
[1:36:52.080 --> 1:36:54.080]  And nobody knows what's happening inside me
[1:36:54.080 --> 1:36:57.080]  So whatever I choose, whether in the election
[1:36:57.080 --> 1:37:00.080]  Or whether in the supermarket, this is my free will
[1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:01.080]  That's over
[1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:05.080]  All this story about Jesus rising from the dead
[1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:07.080]  And being the son of God, this is fake news
[1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:12.080]  I know that in recent years we saw populist politicians
[1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:15.080]  Undermining deliberately the trust that people have
[1:37:15.080 --> 1:37:18.080]  In important institutions like universities
[1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:21.080]  Like respectable media outlets
[1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:23.080]  These populist politicians told people
[1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:27.080]  That, say, scientists are these small elites
[1:37:27.080 --> 1:37:29.080]  So I apologize for objecting you to that
[1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:30.080]  It's only a small portion of it
[1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:33.080]  I wanted you to see what Dr. Zelinka was talking about
[1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:36.080]  So what, obviously, listeners know this is horrific
[1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:38.080]  But what are we hearing here?
[1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:40.080]  Because this is an open, in my view, declaration of war
[1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:42.080]  Against our very existence
[1:37:42.080 --> 1:37:45.080]  And, hey, he said, your free will, forget about it, it's gone
[1:37:45.080 --> 1:37:48.080]  Well, that doesn't sound like something a good guy says to me
[1:37:48.080 --> 1:37:50.080]  Dr. Zelinka
[1:37:50.080 --> 1:37:52.080]  You really want to know what motivates him?
[1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:54.080]  What?
[1:37:55.080 --> 1:37:57.080]  So he's a brilliant man
[1:37:57.080 --> 1:37:59.080]  It's not...
[1:37:59.080 --> 1:38:02.080]  I think it's important to respect your adversary
[1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:03.080]  And their capabilities
[1:38:03.080 --> 1:38:05.080]  He is a PhD from Oxford
[1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:08.080]  He's influenced the most powerful people in the world
[1:38:08.080 --> 1:38:11.080]  But what really motivates him
[1:38:11.080 --> 1:38:13.080]  Is something much more simple
[1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:16.080]  He's learned, he knows the Bible very well
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:18.080]  And if he knows the Bible very well
[1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:20.080]  He knows what God says
[1:38:20.080 --> 1:38:23.080]  Or what is stated in the Bible
[1:38:23.080 --> 1:38:25.080]  What is right and what is wrong
[1:38:25.080 --> 1:38:28.080]  Now, I'm going to say this
[1:38:28.080 --> 1:38:30.080]  Not because I'm placing a value judgment
[1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:32.080]  But because how he interprets it
[1:38:32.080 --> 1:38:35.080]  Now, I personally believe people could live any way they want
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:37.080]  And it's between them and God
[1:38:37.080 --> 1:38:39.080]  So I'm not God's policeman
[1:38:39.080 --> 1:38:41.080]  But he's a homosexual
[1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:43.080]  And he's married to someone
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:45.080]  A man whose name is Yitzhak
[1:38:45.080 --> 1:38:47.080]  And he knows what the Bible...
[1:38:47.080 --> 1:38:48.080]  He mentioned it early
[1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:50.080]  He has real problems with it
[1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:52.080]  He knows what the Bible says about homosexuality
[1:38:52.080 --> 1:38:54.080]  It's called an abomination
[1:38:54.080 --> 1:38:56.080]  And it really...
[1:38:57.080 --> 1:38:59.080]  Really pisses him off
[1:38:59.080 --> 1:39:02.080]  And so from his world view
[1:39:02.080 --> 1:39:04.080]  It's not enough
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:07.080]  Go live your life quietly
[1:39:07.080 --> 1:39:08.080]  Any way you want, no
[1:39:08.080 --> 1:39:11.080]  He decided that he's going to take on God
[1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:14.080]  And he's going to
[1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:16.080]  Invalidate
[1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:18.080]  The concept of God in people's minds
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:21.080]  Because in his world view, God cannot exist
[1:39:21.080 --> 1:39:24.080]  Because if God exists and there's a right and wrong
[1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:27.080]  Then he has a big problem in his mind
[1:39:27.080 --> 1:39:29.080]  There's this cognitive dissonance
[1:39:29.080 --> 1:39:32.080]  And then there's this emotional turbulence and guilt
[1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:34.080]  And he gets anxious
[1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:36.080]  So literally the whole world
[1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:38.080]  Has to suffer
[1:39:38.080 --> 1:39:42.080]  Because you will know Harari's sexual orientation
[1:39:42.080 --> 1:39:45.080]  Is not in line with what he read in the Bible
[1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:48.080]  And therefore he has to
[1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:52.080]  Try to destroy God consciousness in humanity
[1:39:52.080 --> 1:39:54.080]  That's really exactly what it is
[1:39:54.080 --> 1:39:56.080]  They are in rebellion against
[1:39:56.080 --> 1:39:58.080]  The code we've been given to be successful
[1:39:58.080 --> 1:40:00.080]  We have free will to follow it or not
[1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:02.080]  And he has decided to not just rebel
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:05.080]  But to go 180 degrees in the opposite direction
[1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:07.080]  Which is extremely powerful
[1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:09.080]  Because it's anti-Christ or it's anti-human
[1:40:09.080 --> 1:40:11.080]  It's anti-God consciousness
[1:40:11.080 --> 1:40:14.080]  And so again
[1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:16.080]  We're all complex beings
[1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:18.080]  I know I'm not perfect, maybe you are
[1:40:18.080 --> 1:40:20.080]  No, I'm certainly not
[1:40:20.080 --> 1:40:23.080]  I have my demons that I have to deal with also
[1:40:23.080 --> 1:40:25.080]  But I do it in private
[1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:29.080]  And I try to work out my relationship with God in private
[1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:32.080]  And I'm not judging you will know Harari
[1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:37.080]  Until he takes the war against God
[1:40:37.080 --> 1:40:39.080]  Into the world
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:42.080]  And his policies will result
[1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:45.080]  In the extermination of 6.5 billion people
[1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:46.080]  At least
[1:40:46.080 --> 1:40:50.080]  And so this cannot be allowed to go on
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:54.080]  His ideology and his arrogance
[1:40:54.080 --> 1:40:58.080]  To believe that human beings are now gods
[1:40:58.080 --> 1:41:03.080]  Is incompatible with decency
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:06.080]  Incompatible with societal living
[1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:08.080]  Incompatible with God's will
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:11.080]  And cannot be allowed to go on
[1:41:11.080 --> 1:41:13.080]  And doesn't the serpent say
[1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:15.080]  No, not you are a God
[1:41:15.080 --> 1:41:17.080]  You're going to live forever, eat of this
[1:41:17.080 --> 1:41:20.080]  I mean, it's literally be God, take over
[1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:22.080]  But it's not God because God gives us free will
[1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:24.080]  He says you don't get free will
[1:41:24.080 --> 1:41:26.080]  Which proves he's not God
[1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:29.080]  I'm going to take your free will
[1:41:29.080 --> 1:41:32.080]  You know, that's how the serpent seduced the woman
[1:41:32.080 --> 1:41:39.080]  But you know, the human being was meant to live forever
[1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:42.080]  God said in the Bible in Genesis that
[1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:45.080]  If you were to eat from this fruit
[1:41:45.080 --> 1:41:48.080]  Then on that day you should surely die
[1:41:48.080 --> 1:41:52.080]  And so there's a very interesting question that arises
[1:41:52.080 --> 1:41:54.080]  There were two trees in the Garden of Eden
[1:41:54.080 --> 1:41:57.080]  There was one, the tree of knowledge of good and bad
[1:41:57.080 --> 1:41:59.080]  Which they were not supposed to eat from
[1:41:59.080 --> 1:42:02.080]  And then there was the tree of life
[1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:04.080]  And so after the sin
[1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:08.080]  There is a conversation between God and His angels
[1:42:08.080 --> 1:42:13.080]  It says let's evict the man and his wife
[1:42:13.080 --> 1:42:15.080]  From the Garden of Eden
[1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:18.080]  Lest he eat from the tree of life and live forever
[1:42:18.080 --> 1:42:20.080]  So there's an interesting question
[1:42:20.080 --> 1:42:22.080]  He was supposed to live forever
[1:42:22.080 --> 1:42:24.080]  And then there was a sin
[1:42:24.080 --> 1:42:26.080]  So why not let him repent
[1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:28.080]  And let him live forever again
[1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:30.080]  What's the whole point? Why evict him?
[1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:32.080]  Why is God so concerned
[1:42:32.080 --> 1:42:34.080]  That he would eat from the tree of life
[1:42:34.080 --> 1:42:36.080]  And live forever?
[1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:38.080]  So one of the answers is the following
[1:42:38.080 --> 1:42:40.080]  That since they ate from the tree of life
[1:42:40.080 --> 1:42:42.080]  From the tree of knowledge of good and bad
[1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:46.080]  Evil entered them
[1:42:46.080 --> 1:42:48.080]  Us
[1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:50.080]  Stay there, we gotta go to break
[1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:52.080]  We can't give evil eternal life
[1:42:52.080 --> 1:42:53.080]  We'll be right back
[1:42:53.080 --> 1:42:56.080]  We've thrown away our birthright, ladies and gentlemen
[1:42:56.080 --> 1:42:58.080]  You know, it's a fact
[1:42:58.080 --> 1:43:00.080]  And I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true
[1:43:00.080 --> 1:43:03.080]  That info wars is seen by the globalist
[1:43:03.080 --> 1:43:05.080]  As the standard of human liberty
[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:10.080]  As the logo of human populist resistance
[1:43:10.080 --> 1:43:13.080]  Against their transhumanist anti-human program
[1:43:13.080 --> 1:43:17.080]  And man, our work is really right now
[1:43:17.080 --> 1:43:20.080]  Getting the most important aspects
[1:43:20.080 --> 1:43:21.080]  Of what we've ever done
[1:43:21.080 --> 1:43:23.080]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize
[1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:26.080]  We've got great products, thousands of them
[1:43:26.080 --> 1:43:28.080]  At infowars.com
[1:43:28.080 --> 1:43:30.080]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you
[1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:33.080]  And so now we need to support more than ever
[1:43:33.080 --> 1:43:35.080]  Because this fight has intensified
[1:43:35.080 --> 1:43:37.080]  Don't need me to tell you that
[1:43:37.080 --> 1:43:39.080]  At infowars.com
[1:43:39.080 --> 1:43:41.080]  We've got 25 to 75% off

[1:43:43.080 --> 1:43:45.080]  Things have been sold out for a long time
[1:43:45.080 --> 1:43:47.080]  Next-life, fizzy magnesium mix
[1:43:47.080 --> 1:43:48.080]  That's so amazing
[1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:50.080]  And our new immune support formula
[1:43:50.080 --> 1:43:51.080]  That's so critical
[1:43:51.080 --> 1:43:54.080]  They're all available 25 to 75% off
[1:43:54.080 --> 1:43:56.080]  At infowars.com right now
[1:43:56.080 --> 1:43:59.080]  It has been noted by many a historian
[1:43:59.080 --> 1:44:02.080]  The first casualty of war is the truth
[1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:04.080]  And the next big casualty
[1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:07.080]  Isn't even the people that die
[1:44:07.080 --> 1:44:09.080]  No, that invariably follows
[1:44:09.080 --> 1:44:11.080]  But first there is the crackdown
[1:44:11.080 --> 1:44:15.080]  On populations, basic liberty
[1:44:15.080 --> 1:44:18.080]  And speech and massive censorship
[1:44:18.080 --> 1:44:19.080]  And now across the world
[1:44:19.080 --> 1:44:21.080]  From the United States to Europe
[1:44:21.080 --> 1:44:23.080]  Legislations being introduced
[1:44:23.080 --> 1:44:26.080]  That if you amplify
[1:44:26.080 --> 1:44:30.080]  Any quote pro-Russian information
[1:44:30.080 --> 1:44:33.080]  You can be censored, you can be arrested
[1:44:33.080 --> 1:44:35.080]  You can be imprisoned
[1:44:35.080 --> 1:44:37.080]  And of course now Canada is under this legislation
[1:44:37.080 --> 1:44:40.080]  That if you have a fought crime
[1:44:40.080 --> 1:44:43.080]  And they think you may have the intent to engage
[1:44:43.080 --> 1:44:45.080]  In hate speech online
[1:44:45.080 --> 1:44:47.080]  That you will be censored and arrested
[1:44:47.080 --> 1:44:49.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism
[1:44:49.080 --> 1:44:51.080]  Is being carried out by the globalists
[1:44:51.080 --> 1:44:53.080]  Around the world, against humanity
[1:44:53.080 --> 1:44:56.080]  That makes infowars.com more important than ever
[1:44:56.080 --> 1:45:00.080]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda
[1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:02.080]  And with spiritual warfare
[1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:04.080]  And with poisons and chemicals added to the food
[1:45:04.080 --> 1:45:06.080]  It's all come out
[1:45:06.080 --> 1:45:07.080]  And they're doing that
[1:45:07.080 --> 1:45:08.080]  Not because we're weak
[1:45:08.080 --> 1:45:10.080]  But because we're made the image of God
[1:45:10.080 --> 1:45:13.080]  The creator and we are powerful
[1:45:13.080 --> 1:45:16.080]  And the social engineers fear that so much
[1:45:16.080 --> 1:45:18.080]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying
[1:45:18.080 --> 1:45:20.080]  That nobody knows who first came up with
[1:45:20.080 --> 1:45:23.080]  The boy, is it true?
[1:45:23.080 --> 1:45:26.080]  The propaganda would not be necessary
[1:45:26.080 --> 1:45:29.080]  If the situation was hopeless
[1:45:29.080 --> 1:45:31.080]  They need all their propaganda
[1:45:31.080 --> 1:45:32.080]  And all their lies and all their evil
[1:45:32.080 --> 1:45:34.080]  And all their cultural death
[1:45:34.080 --> 1:45:38.080]  Because they know we are strong
[1:45:38.080 --> 1:45:39.080]  And they know in the end
[1:45:39.080 --> 1:45:41.080]  They signed on to the God of this world
[1:45:41.080 --> 1:45:42.080]  Who is a loser
[1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:43.080]  And that's why it's so important
[1:45:43.080 --> 1:45:45.080]  That everybody keep infowars in the air
[1:45:45.080 --> 1:45:46.080]  Now more than ever
[1:45:46.080 --> 1:45:48.080]  Because even if you don't believe in God
[1:45:48.080 --> 1:45:50.080]  What the globalists are manifesting
[1:45:50.080 --> 1:45:52.080]  And setting up is safe handling
[1:45:52.080 --> 1:45:54.080]  And we are opposing the one world government
[1:45:54.080 --> 1:45:56.080]  And the mark of the beast they just announced
[1:45:57.080 --> 1:45:59.080]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more
[1:45:59.080 --> 1:46:00.080]  Common these days
[1:46:00.080 --> 1:46:02.080]  With everything that's going on
[1:46:02.080 --> 1:46:05.080]  Both at home and the world at large
[1:46:05.080 --> 1:46:06.080]  If you are having trouble
[1:46:06.080 --> 1:46:07.080]  Getting to that deep sleep
[1:46:07.080 --> 1:46:09.080]  We could all use more of
[1:46:09.080 --> 1:46:11.080]  Our new sleep support formula
[1:46:11.080 --> 1:46:13.080]  Down and out is just the thing
[1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:16.080]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula
[1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:18.080]  That is specifically designed
[1:46:18.080 --> 1:46:20.080]  To help you get the shut-eye you deserve
[1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:22.080]  Formulated to improve upon
[1:46:22.080 --> 1:46:24.080]  Our best selling product knockout
[1:46:24.080 --> 1:46:25.080]  With down and out
[1:46:25.080 --> 1:46:27.080]  Now the herbs and melatonin
[1:46:27.080 --> 1:46:29.080]  Packed inside are extracted directly
[1:46:29.080 --> 1:46:31.080]  Into the glycerin solution
[1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:33.080]  So the ingredients are already dissolved
[1:46:33.080 --> 1:46:36.080]  Into the formula before you even take it
[1:46:36.080 --> 1:46:38.080]  One of the other sleep support herbs
[1:46:38.080 --> 1:46:40.080]  Included is the passion flower
[1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:42.080]  Which was traditionally used by
[1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:44.080]  Native Americans like the Cherokees
[1:46:44.080 --> 1:46:46.080]  Who used it for its relaxing qualities
[1:46:46.080 --> 1:46:48.080]  Be sure to take this product
[1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:50.080]  When you are completely ready for sleep
[1:46:50.080 --> 1:46:53.080]  Because you will be down and out
[1:46:53.080 --> 1:47:08.080]  Now at infoorstore.com
[1:47:08.080 --> 1:47:28.080]  The answer to 1984 is 1776
[1:47:28.080 --> 1:47:31.080]  We have another special guest joining us as well
[1:47:31.080 --> 1:47:32.080]  Lay it out for people
[1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:34.080]  Because you are absolutely right
[1:47:34.080 --> 1:47:36.080]  The ancient things we heard about
[1:47:36.080 --> 1:47:38.080]  What's currently happening now
[1:47:38.080 --> 1:47:40.080]  Where do you see all this going
[1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:43.080]  How should we respond to this
[1:47:43.080 --> 1:47:47.080]  What other knowledge do you want to lay out for people?
[1:47:47.080 --> 1:47:50.080]  I'm optimistic about the future
[1:47:50.080 --> 1:47:53.080]  I think the true narrative will be revealed
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:55.080]  But let me tell you something very serious
[1:47:55.080 --> 1:47:57.080]  The only unknown variable here
[1:47:57.080 --> 1:48:00.080]  Is the body count until we get there
[1:48:00.080 --> 1:48:04.080]  And we can mitigate that carnage
[1:48:04.080 --> 1:48:06.080]  By spreading the true narrative
[1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:09.080]  And giving people the right information
[1:48:09.080 --> 1:48:12.080]  So they can make good choices
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:15.080]  Everyone has an absolute right
[1:48:15.080 --> 1:48:17.080]  To see both aspects
[1:48:17.080 --> 1:48:19.080]  Or all the options
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:21.080]  Or all the information about an issue
[1:48:21.080 --> 1:48:22.080]  What the media has done
[1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:24.080]  And what the censorship has done
[1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:26.080]  Is only give one aspect
[1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:27.080]  Or one perspective
[1:48:27.080 --> 1:48:30.080]  Which has led people to make terrible choices
[1:48:30.080 --> 1:48:32.080]  And choices that essentially
[1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:36.080]  They choose to walk into a extermination chamber
[1:48:36.080 --> 1:48:40.080]  And so by spreading the true narrative
[1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:44.080]  Or at least another perspective
[1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:48.080]  Then people can use their intellectual powers
[1:48:48.080 --> 1:48:51.080]  Of analytical thought, deductive reasoning
[1:48:51.080 --> 1:48:52.080]  And come to a decision
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:55.080]  Whatever decision they make, it's on them
[1:48:55.080 --> 1:48:56.080]  We have free choice
[1:48:56.080 --> 1:48:57.080]  That's very important
[1:48:57.080 --> 1:49:00.080]  So you got the way you created the world
[1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:03.080]  You gave us two very precious gifts
[1:49:03.080 --> 1:49:05.080]  One is consciousness of self
[1:49:05.080 --> 1:49:08.080]  And two is free choice
[1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:12.080]  Those are two uniquely divine characteristics
[1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:15.080]  Now for choice to exist
[1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:17.080]  There has to be options
[1:49:17.080 --> 1:49:19.080]  Now listen, if I gave you a hundred dollar bill
[1:49:19.080 --> 1:49:21.080]  And a dollar bill and asked you to choose
[1:49:21.080 --> 1:49:23.080]  Really it's not a choice, is it?
[1:49:23.080 --> 1:49:26.080]  Because one is much more attractive than the other
[1:49:26.080 --> 1:49:28.080]  And so for real choice to exist
[1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:31.080]  There has to be two options
[1:49:31.080 --> 1:49:37.080]  That are comparable, perceived as real
[1:49:37.080 --> 1:49:41.080]  And so good and evil are very real
[1:49:41.080 --> 1:49:44.080]  In the consciousness of man
[1:49:44.080 --> 1:49:46.080]  But again the idea is that
[1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:48.080]  I'll give you a parable that's used a lot
[1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:52.080]  That there is a king and he has a son
[1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:55.080]  And the prince is meant to be king soon
[1:49:55.080 --> 1:49:57.080]  But the king loves his people
[1:49:57.080 --> 1:50:00.080]  So he wants to make sure that the prince
[1:50:00.080 --> 1:50:03.080]  Is of proper moral fiber
[1:50:03.080 --> 1:50:07.080]  That he's fitting to rule the people
[1:50:07.080 --> 1:50:11.080]  And so he hires or he gets a prostitute
[1:50:11.080 --> 1:50:16.080]  And orders the prostitute to seduce the prince
[1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:17.080]  That's the parable
[1:50:17.080 --> 1:50:20.080]  If we analyze it, I'll ask you a simple question
[1:50:20.080 --> 1:50:22.080]  Does the king want the prince to sin?
[1:50:22.080 --> 1:50:23.080]  No
[1:50:23.080 --> 1:50:26.080]  Does the prostitute want the prince to sin?
[1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:29.080]  Actually in many ways she's doing the will of the king
[1:50:29.080 --> 1:50:32.080]  And so the answer is also no
[1:50:32.080 --> 1:50:35.080]  And so God creates options
[1:50:35.080 --> 1:50:38.080]  But it doesn't mean that he wants us to choose the dark side
[1:50:38.080 --> 1:50:42.080]  He wants us to turn away from that and to choose him
[1:50:42.080 --> 1:50:46.080]  And by doing that we earn for ourselves
[1:50:46.080 --> 1:50:52.080]  The ultimate relationship and oneness with him
[1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:54.080]  With the eternal, with the internet
[1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:57.080]  And that's amazing because during a finite life
[1:50:57.080 --> 1:50:59.080]  Of a few number of years
[1:50:59.080 --> 1:51:02.080]  We have an opportunity to connect to the eternal
[1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:04.080]  Wow, it's really amazing
[1:51:04.080 --> 1:51:07.080]  And so that's the game that we're playing
[1:51:07.080 --> 1:51:09.080]  And so it's a real game
[1:51:09.080 --> 1:51:11.080]  And that's what's crazy, Donner, to interrupt real quick
[1:51:11.080 --> 1:51:14.080]  Everything the New World Order transhumanist does
[1:51:14.080 --> 1:51:15.080]  Like follows Genesis
[1:51:15.080 --> 1:51:17.080]  And we're going to make you live forever
[1:51:17.080 --> 1:51:18.080]  Just do what we say
[1:51:18.080 --> 1:51:20.080]  And you're going to have this knowledge
[1:51:20.080 --> 1:51:21.080]  But oh, everybody else can't do it
[1:51:21.080 --> 1:51:23.080]  You've got to kill all these people
[1:51:23.080 --> 1:51:26.080]  I mean, it's so obvious that it's literally being fulfilled
[1:51:26.080 --> 1:51:28.080]  It's powerful
[1:51:28.080 --> 1:51:31.080]  You know, the New World Order is a rebranding
[1:51:31.080 --> 1:51:34.080]  Of the oldest old world order
[1:51:34.080 --> 1:51:37.080]  Of paganism, idolatry and child sacrifice
[1:51:37.080 --> 1:51:39.080]  There's nothing new here
[1:51:39.080 --> 1:51:42.080]  These, they call themselves elites
[1:51:42.080 --> 1:51:44.080]  Or globalists or illuminated people
[1:51:44.080 --> 1:51:48.080]  There's nothing more than just devolved pagans
[1:51:48.080 --> 1:51:49.080]  Of yesteryear
[1:51:49.080 --> 1:51:54.080]  And so it's very obvious what they are
[1:51:54.080 --> 1:51:57.080]  The problem is we have become complacent
[1:51:57.080 --> 1:52:02.080]  And we have allowed for, through our choices
[1:52:02.080 --> 1:52:07.080]  For the slaughtering of the unborn
[1:52:07.080 --> 1:52:10.080]  Desecration of marriage, desecration of gender
[1:52:10.080 --> 1:52:13.080]  And blasphemy of the Creator
[1:52:13.080 --> 1:52:15.080]  And what do you think that's going to bring
[1:52:15.080 --> 1:52:17.080]  Blessing into the country?
[1:52:17.080 --> 1:52:22.080]  And so what we need to do is reconcile
[1:52:22.080 --> 1:52:25.080]  On mass with our Creator
[1:52:25.080 --> 1:52:30.080]  When we cross a certain threshold of human hearts
[1:52:30.080 --> 1:52:34.080]  Reconciling with their Creator, with our Creator
[1:52:34.080 --> 1:52:38.080]  Then there will be a real shift
[1:52:38.080 --> 1:52:39.080]  A real New World Order
[1:52:39.080 --> 1:52:41.080]  That's right, we have to through free will
[1:52:41.080 --> 1:52:43.080]  Choose God, God consciousness
[1:52:43.080 --> 1:52:45.080]  Say we're sorry, ask God to help us
[1:52:45.080 --> 1:52:48.080]  And that's when things start to change
[1:52:48.080 --> 1:52:51.080]  Exactly, and the best way to do that
[1:52:51.080 --> 1:52:54.080]  Is to live by an example
[1:52:54.080 --> 1:52:56.080]  You can't preach to others and not do it yourself
[1:52:56.080 --> 1:53:02.080]  So I found that the people that I'm drawn to most
[1:53:02.080 --> 1:53:05.080]  Are those that really are humble and work on themselves
[1:53:05.080 --> 1:53:08.080]  And find a certain degree of serenity and tranquility
[1:53:08.080 --> 1:53:10.080]  Which is extremely attractive
[1:53:10.080 --> 1:53:12.080]  And especially in the world of chaos
[1:53:12.080 --> 1:53:15.080]  And it makes me curious, what do they know that I don't
[1:53:15.080 --> 1:53:19.080]  And so that draws me in into a process of self-retirement
[1:53:19.080 --> 1:53:22.080]  So the problem is with modern day institutions
[1:53:22.080 --> 1:53:28.080]  Whether it's religious, academic, political, industrial
[1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:30.080]  It doesn't really matter, they're all corrupted
[1:53:30.080 --> 1:53:32.080]  By the same serpent
[1:53:32.080 --> 1:53:36.080]  Anything that's institutionalized has been hijacked
[1:53:36.080 --> 1:53:40.080]  And so it's most tragic when it's in the religious realms
[1:53:40.080 --> 1:53:42.080]  Because they, actually what they do
[1:53:42.080 --> 1:53:45.080]  The one place of salvation is used to
[1:53:45.080 --> 1:53:48.080]  Desocrate the name of God and enslave people
[1:53:48.080 --> 1:53:50.080]  I'll only talk about my religion
[1:53:50.080 --> 1:53:52.080]  Because I don't feel comfortable talking about others
[1:53:52.080 --> 1:53:56.080]  But I've seen such tyranny in the last two years
[1:53:56.080 --> 1:54:01.080]  Within the Jewish faith, you know, people couldn't go to...
[1:54:01.080 --> 1:54:03.080]  Well, I mean, look at Israel, there's obviously
[1:54:03.080 --> 1:54:06.080]  A new extermination going on, it's so obvious
[1:54:06.080 --> 1:54:09.080]  What's happening there, you've talked about that
[1:54:09.080 --> 1:54:11.080]  The most oppressed people right now
[1:54:11.080 --> 1:54:14.080]  In the world under COVID tyranny are Israel
[1:54:14.080 --> 1:54:16.080]  And then Australia and maybe Austria
[1:54:16.080 --> 1:54:18.080]  What's happening there?
[1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:20.080]  Well, half of Israel has AIDS
[1:54:20.080 --> 1:54:25.080]  And the vaccine-induced immune deficiency syndrome
[1:54:25.080 --> 1:54:27.080]  I didn't say HIV, they don't have HIV
[1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:31.080]  But half of Israel, they're immune systems
[1:54:31.080 --> 1:54:34.080]  They're innate immune systems, they're T-cell function
[1:54:34.080 --> 1:54:37.080]  Natural killer cell function, macrophages
[1:54:37.080 --> 1:54:39.080]  Two more suppressogens are holding down
[1:54:39.080 --> 1:54:42.080]  So why, again, is the globalist force
[1:54:42.080 --> 1:54:44.080]  Attacking the Jews?
[1:54:44.080 --> 1:54:46.080]  Because I mean, it really is, you can see it right there
[1:54:46.080 --> 1:54:48.080]  Like literally the main attack out of...
[1:54:48.080 --> 1:54:50.080]  Everywhere is Israel, that's where they're like
[1:54:50.080 --> 1:54:54.080]  On their fifth and sixth shots right now
[1:54:54.080 --> 1:54:57.080]  So I always delineate the state of Israel
[1:54:57.080 --> 1:55:00.080]  From the biblical people of Israel
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:02.080]  The two different entities, the state of Israel
[1:55:02.080 --> 1:55:05.080]  Is a secular socialist entity
[1:55:05.080 --> 1:55:09.080]  And the Jewish people biblically have been tasked
[1:55:09.080 --> 1:55:12.080]  With the role of being a light unto the nations
[1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:14.080]  And so you're going to tell me if I'm wrong
[1:55:14.080 --> 1:55:17.080]  Good Jews have been led there to try to be close to God
[1:55:17.080 --> 1:55:19.080]  But the evil runs the political system
[1:55:19.080 --> 1:55:21.080]  That's not going to try to kill them
[1:55:21.080 --> 1:55:25.080]  Oh yes, I really think that what Hitler started
[1:55:25.080 --> 1:55:27.080]  The Israeli government is finishing
[1:55:27.080 --> 1:55:29.080]  Wow, yeah
[1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:31.080]  That's what I see as well, this is so diabolical
[1:55:31.080 --> 1:55:33.080]  What would you advise Israelis to do?
[1:55:33.080 --> 1:55:39.080]  Revolt, civil war
[1:55:39.080 --> 1:55:42.080]  To not comply with mandates
[1:55:42.080 --> 1:55:44.080]  By the way, I'm talking about my own brothers and sisters
[1:55:44.080 --> 1:55:48.080]  Literally who have been enslaved and poisoned
[1:55:48.080 --> 1:55:51.080]  I mean, this is not theoretical
[1:55:51.080 --> 1:55:53.080]  I mean, these are my relatives
[1:55:53.080 --> 1:55:55.080]  Oh, I've had family die of the shot, Dr. Zlinko
[1:55:55.080 --> 1:55:57.080]  I know it's real
[1:55:57.080 --> 1:56:04.080]  So I think that family nowadays
[1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:06.080]  Is a different concept
[1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:08.080]  Family I would define as those people
[1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:12.080]  That are ideologically or theologically aligned
[1:56:12.080 --> 1:56:16.080]  In trying to live in a world of God consciousness
[1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:20.080]  And try to maintain the possibility
[1:56:20.080 --> 1:56:23.080]  Of true freedom in this world
[1:56:23.080 --> 1:56:26.080]  And people that are walking away from God consciousness
[1:56:26.080 --> 1:56:29.080]  Are choosing to enslave themselves
[1:56:29.080 --> 1:56:32.080]  To really sociopaths
[1:56:32.080 --> 1:56:35.080]  And they become codependent on this cult
[1:56:35.080 --> 1:56:38.080]  There's only one free type of person in this world, Alex
[1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:40.080]  In my opinion, someone who chooses
[1:56:40.080 --> 1:56:42.080]  To be a servant of God
[1:56:42.080 --> 1:56:44.080]  That's right
[1:56:44.080 --> 1:56:47.080]  The operative word here is chooses
[1:56:47.080 --> 1:56:51.080]  And so, I think each human being is being tested
[1:56:51.080 --> 1:56:55.080]  We are being tested, God is the flood waters arising
[1:56:55.080 --> 1:56:58.080]  And this time around, God is saying, get on the ark
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:00.080]  You don't have to drown
[1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:03.080]  But the world will be cleaned up
[1:57:03.080 --> 1:57:04.080]  There's no doubt about it
[1:57:04.080 --> 1:57:06.080]  Oh, I agree, this thing's not going to succeed
[1:57:06.080 --> 1:57:10.080]  Dr. Zlinko, you know, we've got ZDtoxlife.com
[1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:12.080]  Ford Slice, Alex, with your great product
[1:57:12.080 --> 1:57:13.080]  For your immune system, your body
[1:57:13.080 --> 1:57:14.080]  I want to promote that
[1:57:14.080 --> 1:57:15.080]  I don't even come on about that
[1:57:15.080 --> 1:57:16.080]  But you just do a great job
[1:57:16.080 --> 1:57:18.080]  You were the pioneer of putting things out
[1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:19.080]  To protect people
[1:57:19.080 --> 1:57:20.080]  Now more than ever, they should
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:22.080]  At ZDtoxlife.com
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:24.080]  Ford Slice, Alex will also post it
[1:57:24.080 --> 1:57:26.080]  On the live show feed under the show right now
[1:57:26.080 --> 1:57:29.080]  But I want to come back and just ask you about
[1:57:29.080 --> 1:57:30.080]  What you see coming next
[1:57:30.080 --> 1:57:32.080]  And how we can get prepared
[1:57:32.080 --> 1:57:33.080]  Final segment straight ahead
[1:57:33.080 --> 1:57:35.080]  And then, we have the big lawyer
[1:57:35.080 --> 1:57:37.080]  That's been getting all these big events going
[1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:39.080]  Exposing the mass murder
[1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:41.080]  Joining us, Mr. Fulming
[1:57:41.080 --> 1:57:42.080]  That's coming up as well
[1:57:42.080 --> 1:57:44.080]  Stay with us
[1:57:46.080 --> 1:57:50.080]  We are only offering three coins in the series
[1:57:50.080 --> 1:57:53.080]  The first coin was released in December of 2021
[1:57:53.080 --> 1:57:54.080]  And sold out in 10 days
[1:57:54.080 --> 1:57:57.080]  Now, the second coin as we enter
[1:57:57.080 --> 1:58:01.080]  The last days of March into April, 2022
[1:58:01.080 --> 1:58:02.080]  Is now being offered
[1:58:02.080 --> 1:58:05.080]  And I believe it will sell out in just a few days
[1:58:05.080 --> 1:58:07.080]  Again, because these are historic coins
[1:58:07.080 --> 1:58:08.080]  And because our amazing listeners
[1:58:08.080 --> 1:58:10.080]  Want to support freedom
[1:58:10.080 --> 1:58:12.080]  And keep info wars at the front lines
[1:58:12.080 --> 1:58:13.080]  Of the fight against these tyrants
[1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:16.080]  So, go for yourself to
[1:58:16.080 --> 1:58:18.080]  1776coin.com
[1:58:18.080 --> 1:58:21.080]  And see the new Liberty Tree coin
[1:58:21.080 --> 1:58:23.080]  It is powerful
[1:58:23.080 --> 1:58:26.080]  Witness this powerful iconography for yourself
[1:58:26.080 --> 1:58:28.080]  And have this piece of history
[1:58:28.080 --> 1:58:31.080]  And be part of the founding member system
[1:58:31.080 --> 1:58:34.080]  That we're set to launch in the very near future
[1:58:34.080 --> 1:58:37.080]  Thanks to your support of this project
[1:58:37.080 --> 1:58:39.080]  Get a historic memento
[1:58:39.080 --> 1:58:41.080]  That helps keep info wars on the air
[1:58:41.080 --> 1:58:44.080]  And also gives you a real piece of history
[1:58:44.080 --> 1:58:46.080]  At 1776coin.com
[1:58:46.080 --> 1:58:48.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help
[1:58:48.080 --> 1:58:51.080]  I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong
[1:58:51.080 --> 1:58:55.080]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on
[1:58:55.080 --> 1:58:57.080]  I was born for this
[1:58:57.080 --> 1:58:58.080]  You were born for this
[1:58:58.080 --> 1:59:00.080]  And people are really waking up right now
[1:59:00.080 --> 1:59:03.080]  But we had to build our own infrastructure
[1:59:03.080 --> 1:59:05.080]  Because of the censorship and de-platforming
[1:59:05.080 --> 1:59:07.080]  That cost tens of millions of dollars
[1:59:07.080 --> 1:59:09.080]  And now, with Bandot video
[1:59:09.080 --> 1:59:11.080]  Getting close to 10 million views a day
[1:59:11.080 --> 1:59:13.080]  We're a platform for thousands
[1:59:13.080 --> 1:59:15.080]  Of independent journalists and groups
[1:59:15.080 --> 1:59:18.080]  To be able to post their content free of charge
[1:59:18.080 --> 1:59:21.080]  And because it's become so successful
[1:59:21.080 --> 1:59:23.080]  It's a catch-22
[1:59:23.080 --> 1:59:25.080]  Info wars and Bandot video
[1:59:25.080 --> 1:59:27.080]  Have become a mothership
[1:59:27.080 --> 1:59:29.080]  Promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide
[1:59:29.080 --> 1:59:32.080]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone
[1:59:32.080 --> 1:59:34.080]  Are millions of dollars a quarter
[1:59:34.080 --> 1:59:36.080]  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month
[1:59:36.080 --> 1:59:38.080]  So the biggest sale in info wars history
[1:59:38.080 --> 1:59:39.080]  Is going right now
[1:59:39.080 --> 1:59:41.080]  The mega emergency blowout sale
[1:59:41.080 --> 1:59:42.080]  Up to 75% off
[1:59:42.080 --> 1:59:44.080]  Getting credible products
[1:59:44.080 --> 1:59:46.080]  And keep info wars as strong as ever
[1:59:48.080 --> 1:59:50.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[1:59:50.080 --> 1:59:52.080]  Of the New World Order
[1:59:52.080 --> 2:00:20.080]  It's Alex Jones
[2:00:20.080 --> 2:00:22.080]  You read that
[2:00:22.080 --> 2:00:24.080]  Everything is going to happen
[2:00:24.080 --> 2:00:26.080]  Exactly as it's going to happen
[2:00:26.080 --> 2:00:28.080]  I'm just giving credit words too
[2:00:28.080 --> 2:00:30.080]  And that's that paradox
[2:00:30.080 --> 2:00:32.080]  They're good Germans or bad Germans
[2:00:32.080 --> 2:00:34.080]  They're good Christians or bad Christians
[2:00:34.080 --> 2:00:36.080]  They're good Jews or bad Jews
[2:00:36.080 --> 2:00:38.080]  But I got to say
[2:00:38.080 --> 2:00:40.080]  Dr. Zelinko, it is amazing
[2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:42.080]  That Ezekiel and Moses
[2:00:42.080 --> 2:00:44.080]  And everything is just so powerful
[2:00:44.080 --> 2:00:46.080]  A few minutes
[2:00:46.080 --> 2:00:48.080]  Because I know you're a humble person
[2:00:48.080 --> 2:00:50.080]  But how did the Jews
[2:00:50.080 --> 2:00:52.080]  Particularly foresee all of this
[2:00:52.080 --> 2:00:54.080]  Out of all the cultures
[2:00:54.080 --> 2:00:56.080]  Because the more I study it
[2:00:56.080 --> 2:00:58.080]  The more those ancient Jews
[2:00:58.080 --> 2:01:00.080]  5,000, 6,000, 3,000 years ago
[2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:02.080]  Are dead on you know
[2:01:02.080 --> 2:01:04.080]  Plato I've given credit to
[2:01:04.080 --> 2:01:06.080]  He made a lot of predictions
[2:01:06.080 --> 2:01:08.080]  Made a lot of things 2,300 years ago
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:10.080]  So the Greeks you got to give some credit to too
[2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:12.080]  But what's going on
[2:01:12.080 --> 2:01:14.080]  With Jews knowing all this
[2:01:14.080 --> 2:01:16.080]  And somebody like Harari turns his back completely on it
[2:01:16.080 --> 2:01:18.080]  And Jews are absolutely nothing
[2:01:18.080 --> 2:01:20.080]  Without the law
[2:01:20.080 --> 2:01:22.080]  And without
[2:01:22.080 --> 2:01:24.080]  Being a creator
[2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:26.080]  And serving as
[2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:28.080]  A light unto the nation
[2:01:28.080 --> 2:01:30.080]  By bringing the knowledge
[2:01:30.080 --> 2:01:32.080]  Of the creator into the creation
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:34.080]  And no one's denying that
[2:01:34.080 --> 2:01:36.080]  It was the Jewish faith
[2:01:36.080 --> 2:01:38.080]  That brought
[2:01:38.080 --> 2:01:40.080]  The morality
[2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:42.080]  And God's law into the world
[2:01:42.080 --> 2:01:44.080]  And so
[2:01:44.080 --> 2:01:46.080]  It really starts with
[2:01:46.080 --> 2:01:48.080]  The characteristics and attributes
[2:01:48.080 --> 2:01:50.080]  Of the first Jew, Abraham
[2:01:50.080 --> 2:01:52.080]  Now let me just paint a picture
[2:01:52.080 --> 2:01:54.080]  Of how he grew up
[2:01:54.080 --> 2:01:56.080]  He grew up in a world where no one believed in the one God
[2:01:56.080 --> 2:01:58.080]  Everyone was an idol worshiper
[2:01:58.080 --> 2:02:00.080]  Including his own father
[2:02:00.080 --> 2:02:02.080]  And he sensed
[2:02:02.080 --> 2:02:04.080]  Just logically rationally
[2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:06.080]  Something not right here, it doesn't make sense
[2:02:06.080 --> 2:02:08.080]  And he used his mind
[2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:10.080]  And came to the conclusion that no
[2:02:10.080 --> 2:02:12.080]  There must be a primal cause
[2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:14.080]  From God that set everything into motion
[2:02:14.080 --> 2:02:16.080]  And he went public about that
[2:02:16.080 --> 2:02:18.080]  And
[2:02:18.080 --> 2:02:20.080]  He was not liked
[2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:22.080]  Actually, the entire world tried to kill him
[2:02:22.080 --> 2:02:24.080]  And he said
[2:02:24.080 --> 2:02:26.080]  I don't care, I'm going to stand up for my principles
[2:02:26.080 --> 2:02:28.080]  My beliefs
[2:02:28.080 --> 2:02:30.080]  I'm going to sanctify the name of God
[2:02:30.080 --> 2:02:32.080]  Even if it costs me my life
[2:02:32.080 --> 2:02:34.080]  And he was the only one on the planet doing
[2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:36.080]  But that was the essence
[2:02:36.080 --> 2:02:38.080]  The stubbornness, this arrogance
[2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:40.080]  But for God
[2:02:40.080 --> 2:02:42.080]  Every act of it could be used
[2:02:42.080 --> 2:02:44.080]  For good and for bad
[2:02:44.080 --> 2:02:46.080]  And if you have an arrogant streak in you
[2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:48.080]  But a stubborn streak
[2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:50.080]  But if you use it
[2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:52.080]  To serve God, then it's not necessarily bad
[2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:54.080]  And so
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:56.080]  Abraham was a stubborn guy
[2:02:56.080 --> 2:02:58.080]  And he stood up to the entire world
[2:02:58.080 --> 2:03:00.080]  And said, no, I'm not going to worship your idols
[2:03:00.080 --> 2:03:02.080]  You are
[2:03:02.080 --> 2:03:04.080]  Wrong
[2:03:04.080 --> 2:03:06.080]  And there is a creator
[2:03:06.080 --> 2:03:08.080]  To answer your question
[2:03:08.080 --> 2:03:10.080]  It's nothing special about us
[2:03:10.080 --> 2:03:12.080]  It's the fact that we were
[2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:14.080]  Tasked and put into
[2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:16.080]  A role
[2:03:16.080 --> 2:03:18.080]  And only when we observe that role
[2:03:18.080 --> 2:03:20.080]  Is there
[2:03:20.080 --> 2:03:22.080]  A certain grace
[2:03:22.080 --> 2:03:24.080]  That's brought into the world
[2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:26.080]  Exactly, only when we're in line with the will of God
[2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:28.080]  Are any of us strong
[2:03:28.080 --> 2:03:30.080]  Correct
[2:03:30.080 --> 2:03:32.080]  We've got other guests coming up
[2:03:32.080 --> 2:03:34.080]  We've got Reiner Fulmet coming on
[2:03:34.080 --> 2:03:36.080]  You never plug this stuff, but it's a great product
[2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:38.080]  So do a few more minutes and we'll come back for a break
[2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:40.080]  I want to talk about ZStack
[2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:42.080]  And the other products, but start talking about it now
[2:03:42.080 --> 2:03:44.080]  You've got a new website for it
[2:03:44.080 --> 2:03:46.080]  It's ZDT
[2:03:46.080 --> 2:03:48.080]  Or ZDtoxLife.com
[2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:50.080]  You're also supporting us
[2:03:50.080 --> 2:03:52.080]  Doctor, spend a minute or so
[2:03:52.080 --> 2:03:54.080]  To talk about these products you've got
[2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:56.080]  You've got a bunch of great products
[2:03:56.080 --> 2:03:58.080]  Well, NAC is
[2:03:58.080 --> 2:04:00.080]  A stop of luck class
[2:04:00.080 --> 2:04:02.080]  And for some reason there's a lot of luck clubs going around
[2:04:02.080 --> 2:04:04.080]  Killing people, right?
[2:04:04.080 --> 2:04:06.080]  So if you're at risk
[2:04:06.080 --> 2:04:08.080]  For blood clots, NAC is
[2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:10.080]  Over-the-counter option, which is great
[2:04:10.080 --> 2:04:12.080]  Then EGCG
[2:04:12.080 --> 2:04:14.080]  It's a green tea extract
[2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:16.080]  One of the most powerful zinc ionophores
[2:04:16.080 --> 2:04:18.080]  I get zinc into the cell
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:20.080]  And then it has zinc
[2:04:20.080 --> 2:04:22.080]  Because zinc stops RNA viruses from replicating
[2:04:22.080 --> 2:04:24.080]  Well, stay there
[2:04:24.080 --> 2:04:26.080]  Come back and just do two, three minutes
[2:04:26.080 --> 2:04:28.080]  We'll be on the side ahead of Reiner Fulmet
[2:04:28.080 --> 2:04:30.080]  Because I want you to talk about this
[2:04:30.080 --> 2:04:32.080]  Because I want to run an ad on air
[2:04:32.080 --> 2:04:34.080]  I love your products, my family uses them
[2:04:34.080 --> 2:04:36.080]  My products are great too, but yours are just as good
[2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:38.080]  Or even better, I just want people to know about them
[2:04:38.080 --> 2:04:40.080]  So please, humor me, let's come back in a minute
[2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:42.080]  I want you to talk two, three minutes
[2:04:42.080 --> 2:04:44.080]  So I can put an ad out of you talking about these great products
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:46.080]  People find it at ZDtoxLife.com
[2:04:46.080 --> 2:04:48.080]  Or at Slash Alex if people want to support
[2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:50.080]  The broadcast, whatever you do
[2:04:50.080 --> 2:04:52.080]  Boost your immune system now
[2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:54.080]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds
[2:04:54.080 --> 2:04:56.080]  Stay with us
[2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:00.080]  In December of 2021
[2:05:00.080 --> 2:05:02.080]  InfoWars offered the first
[2:05:02.080 --> 2:05:04.080]  In a three-part series
[2:05:04.080 --> 2:05:06.080]  The 1776
[2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:08.080]  Anti-Tyrant Coin
[2:05:08.080 --> 2:05:10.080]  And it sold out in ten days
[2:05:10.080 --> 2:05:12.080]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this
[2:05:12.080 --> 2:05:14.080]  Original, powerful coin
[2:05:14.080 --> 2:05:16.080]  A founding member coin
[2:05:16.080 --> 2:05:18.080]  We would not be on air today
[2:05:18.080 --> 2:05:20.080]  Now, the second coin
[2:05:20.080 --> 2:05:22.080]  The Liberty Tree Coin
[2:05:22.080 --> 2:05:24.080]  Is being offered, and it will probably sell out
[2:05:24.080 --> 2:05:26.080]  In ten days again
[2:05:26.080 --> 2:05:28.080]  It certainly needs to
[2:05:28.080 --> 2:05:30.080]  It is so historic
[2:05:30.080 --> 2:05:32.080]  And it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson
[2:05:32.080 --> 2:05:34.080]  About the Tree of Liberty being refreshed
[2:05:34.080 --> 2:05:36.080]  With the blood of Patriots in Tyrants
[2:05:36.080 --> 2:05:37.080]  And more
[2:05:37.080 --> 2:05:39.080]  See the coin for yourself
[2:05:39.080 --> 2:05:41.080]  At 1776coin.com
[2:05:41.080 --> 2:05:43.080]  It's also at infowarstore.com
[2:05:43.080 --> 2:05:46.080]  It's amazing, there's only 10,000 of them
[2:05:46.080 --> 2:05:49.080]  And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air
[2:05:49.080 --> 2:05:52.080]  We're planning something very, very special for everyone
[2:05:52.080 --> 2:05:54.080]  That helps us go to the next level
[2:05:54.080 --> 2:05:57.080]  So get your new Tree of Liberty Coin while you still can
[2:05:57.080 --> 2:05:59.080]  At 1776coin.com
[2:06:09.080 --> 2:06:12.080]  Live from the Infowars.com studios
[2:06:12.080 --> 2:06:14.080]  It's Alex Jones
[2:06:16.080 --> 2:06:18.080]  All right, Dr. Reiner Fulmick
[2:06:18.080 --> 2:06:21.080]  Is loaded for bear, he's coming up here in just a few minutes
[2:06:21.080 --> 2:06:24.080]  But one of my favorite guys, Dr. Vladimir Zevsilenko
[2:06:24.080 --> 2:06:26.080]  Of ZDTalksLife.com
[2:06:26.080 --> 2:06:29.080]  Is here, and I wanted him because he's got great products
[2:06:29.080 --> 2:06:31.080]  He came up with all these different treatments
[2:06:31.080 --> 2:06:33.080]  Two years ago that saved millions of lives
[2:06:33.080 --> 2:06:35.080]  He never wants to talk about it, but I approached him
[2:06:35.080 --> 2:06:37.080]  I said, you should be a sponsor
[2:06:37.080 --> 2:06:39.080]  We want to promote your products, he said, fine
[2:06:39.080 --> 2:06:41.080]  So humor me, because I asked him last segment to do it
[2:06:41.080 --> 2:06:43.080]  And he went off on a deal about Abraham
[2:06:43.080 --> 2:06:45.080]  Which is powerful, I love hearing it
[2:06:45.080 --> 2:06:48.080]  But spend a few minutes, sir, about the great products you've got
[2:06:48.080 --> 2:06:51.080]  That counter all the crazy stuff that's going on in the world
[2:06:51.080 --> 2:06:55.080]  So, you know, I see people dropping dead from blood clots
[2:06:57.080 --> 2:07:00.080]  And getting immune dysregulation, you know
[2:07:00.080 --> 2:07:02.080]  Or on the reactive immune system
[2:07:02.080 --> 2:07:05.080]  And dying from stuff that they shouldn't be dying from
[2:07:05.080 --> 2:07:07.080]  Like a cold or an Omicron
[2:07:07.080 --> 2:07:10.080]  And so I thought there was a need to
[2:07:10.080 --> 2:07:12.080]  You know, that the law allows me to say
[2:07:12.080 --> 2:07:14.080]  Create a nutritional supplement and an immune booster
[2:07:14.080 --> 2:07:16.080]  That may help people
[2:07:16.080 --> 2:07:20.080]  And so ZDTalks contains NAC
[2:07:20.080 --> 2:07:22.080]  And the seal assisting
[2:07:22.080 --> 2:07:24.080]  This stuff stops blood clots
[2:07:24.080 --> 2:07:26.080]  Everything I'm saying is peer reviewed
[2:07:26.080 --> 2:07:29.080]  NIH on the NIH server and so on
[2:07:29.080 --> 2:07:31.080]  So NAC stops blood clots
[2:07:31.080 --> 2:07:33.080]  And if someone's at risk of blood clots
[2:07:33.080 --> 2:07:36.080]  For whatever reason, that's a good thing
[2:07:36.080 --> 2:07:40.080]  And also one of the problems I've seen lately
[2:07:40.080 --> 2:07:43.080]  For some unknown reason is people's immune systems are getting destroyed
[2:07:43.080 --> 2:07:47.080]  And so using EGCG
[2:07:47.080 --> 2:07:50.080]  Which is a green TX tract together with higher-dose zinc
[2:07:50.080 --> 2:07:54.080]  Mitigates the risk of getting certain viruses
[2:07:54.080 --> 2:07:58.080]  Like new further future strains of COVID
[2:07:58.080 --> 2:08:01.080]  Or influenza virus or RSV virus
[2:08:01.080 --> 2:08:03.080]  Or even got some bit Marburg virus
[2:08:03.080 --> 2:08:06.080]  Which is a potential emerging bioterrorist threat
[2:08:06.080 --> 2:08:09.080]  They're all oxygen-stranded RNA viruses
[2:08:09.080 --> 2:08:12.080]  So by inhibiting the common pathway
[2:08:12.080 --> 2:08:15.080]  Or viruses to replicate these viruses
[2:08:15.080 --> 2:08:19.080]  That is a very good thing for people who have damaged immune systems
[2:08:19.080 --> 2:08:23.080]  I'm trying to detox people from a toxic world
[2:08:23.080 --> 2:08:25.080]  If you can read between the lines
[2:08:25.080 --> 2:08:27.080]  And so it was born out of need
[2:08:27.080 --> 2:08:31.080]  I can't stand having people die from blood clots
[2:08:31.080 --> 2:08:33.080]  20-year-old die from blood clots
[2:08:33.080 --> 2:08:34.080]  What the hell is that?
[2:08:34.080 --> 2:08:36.080]  And so we need to...
[2:08:36.080 --> 2:08:38.080]  I have some very good news
[2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:39.080]  Most people don't know this
[2:08:39.080 --> 2:08:42.080]  But in three years or so
[2:08:42.080 --> 2:08:44.080]  There's technology to come out
[2:08:44.080 --> 2:08:47.080]  That's going to completely reboot the innate immune system
[2:08:47.080 --> 2:08:49.080]  There's a way to restore...
[2:08:49.080 --> 2:08:51.080]  Basically cure AIDS in a sense
[2:08:51.080 --> 2:08:53.080]  But that's going to take three years
[2:08:53.080 --> 2:08:57.080]  And to have a bridge to help people get to that point
[2:08:57.080 --> 2:08:59.080]  Until that technology is available
[2:08:59.080 --> 2:09:02.080]  I think is a worthy thing to do
[2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:06.080]  And people can get the great products
[2:09:06.080 --> 2:09:07.080]  And your supporter of ours
[2:09:07.080 --> 2:09:10.080]  Their amazing zdtoxlife.com
[2:09:10.080 --> 2:09:13.080]  In closing, Doc
[2:09:13.080 --> 2:09:15.080]  When you came out two years ago and said
[2:09:15.080 --> 2:09:16.080]  It's going to cause HIV
[2:09:16.080 --> 2:09:19.080]  Dr. Yi Don, the former head of Pfizer Science
[2:09:19.080 --> 2:09:23.080]  Said that we knew that it was the HIV delivery system patented
[2:09:23.080 --> 2:09:27.080]  By Gates and others in Moderna in 2016
[2:09:27.080 --> 2:09:29.080]  The nakedness of this
[2:09:29.080 --> 2:09:31.080]  I mean, it's obviously premeditated
[2:09:31.080 --> 2:09:33.080]  But I'm just shocked that they would like patented
[2:09:33.080 --> 2:09:35.080]  And own it and do it
[2:09:35.080 --> 2:09:37.080]  And then now it's happening
[2:09:37.080 --> 2:09:39.080]  I mean, these people have got...
[2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:40.080]  They've got some balls
[2:09:40.080 --> 2:09:42.080]  They've got to carry around a wheelbarrow
[2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:43.080]  I'm not a violent guy
[2:09:43.080 --> 2:09:44.080]  I'm calling for violence
[2:09:44.080 --> 2:09:46.080]  But you kill people in my family
[2:09:46.080 --> 2:09:47.080]  You're going to pay for it
[2:09:47.080 --> 2:09:48.080]  And there's a lot of people
[2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:49.080]  That are really going to do whatever it takes
[2:09:49.080 --> 2:09:51.080]  To stop these people politically
[2:09:51.080 --> 2:09:52.080]  I mean, I just can't believe
[2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:54.080]  Why do they want to kill us?
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:56.080]  Why are they starting this fight with us?
[2:09:58.080 --> 2:10:01.080]  Well, you're an impediment to them
[2:10:01.080 --> 2:10:03.080]  You know, there's two ways to approach life
[2:10:03.080 --> 2:10:06.080]  I'm going to grow together with you
[2:10:06.080 --> 2:10:08.080]  And as a collaboration
[2:10:08.080 --> 2:10:09.080]  And we all prosper
[2:10:09.080 --> 2:10:11.080]  Or I'm going to make myself feel better
[2:10:11.080 --> 2:10:13.080]  And grow by stepping on your head
[2:10:13.080 --> 2:10:14.080]  These are narcissists
[2:10:14.080 --> 2:10:16.080]  These are people that...
[2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:17.080]  You know, the whole world is suffering
[2:10:17.080 --> 2:10:19.080]  Because Bill Gates couldn't find a girlfriend
[2:10:19.080 --> 2:10:20.080]  In high school
[2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:22.080]  Their hatred for humanity
[2:10:22.080 --> 2:10:23.080]  Is so severe
[2:10:23.080 --> 2:10:24.080]  That they only...
[2:10:24.080 --> 2:10:26.080]  They literally get like sexual gratification
[2:10:26.080 --> 2:10:28.080]  By destroying other people
[2:10:28.080 --> 2:10:29.080]  That's it
[2:10:29.080 --> 2:10:30.080]  That's the psychology
[2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:32.080]  Dr. Zelenko, we love you
[2:10:32.080 --> 2:10:33.080]  We appreciate you
[2:10:33.080 --> 2:10:35.080]  ZDTalksLive.com
[2:10:35.080 --> 2:10:36.080]  Thank you so much
[2:10:36.080 --> 2:10:37.080]  Look forward to talking to you soon
[2:10:37.080 --> 2:10:38.080]  God bless you, Alex
[2:10:38.080 --> 2:10:39.080]  God bless you, Mary
[2:10:39.080 --> 2:10:41.080]  God bless you, powerful
[2:10:41.080 --> 2:10:43.080]  Our interview, powerful
[2:10:43.080 --> 2:10:45.080]  And now, I could ask a hundred questions
[2:10:45.080 --> 2:10:46.080]  To this guy
[2:10:46.080 --> 2:10:48.080]  But it's just best if I bring him on
[2:10:48.080 --> 2:10:50.080]  And talk about what he's done
[2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:52.080]  He is a lawyer
[2:10:52.080 --> 2:10:54.080]  He has put on these
[2:10:54.080 --> 2:10:55.080]  Committee hearings
[2:10:55.080 --> 2:10:57.080]  That have been seen by tens of millions of people
[2:10:57.080 --> 2:10:59.080]  Dealing with the war crimes
[2:10:59.080 --> 2:11:00.080]  That have been committed
[2:11:00.080 --> 2:11:02.080]  Dr. Reiner Fulmick joins us
[2:11:02.080 --> 2:11:04.080]  And the best way to cover this
[2:11:04.080 --> 2:11:06.080]  Is just to let him take over
[2:11:06.080 --> 2:11:08.080]  And tell us in the next 45 minutes
[2:11:08.080 --> 2:11:09.080]  What he's about to cover
[2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:11.080]  Fulmick.com
[2:11:11.080 --> 2:11:15.080]  F-U-E-L-L-M-I-C-H.com
[2:11:15.080 --> 2:11:17.080]  CrimesAgainstHumanityTour.com
[2:11:17.080 --> 2:11:18.080]  He is here
[2:11:18.080 --> 2:11:19.080]  So thank you so much, sir
[2:11:19.080 --> 2:11:21.080]  Dr. Reiner Fulmick for joining us
[2:11:21.080 --> 2:11:23.080]  Tell us in the next four or five minutes
[2:11:23.080 --> 2:11:25.080]  To break what you're about to lay out today
[2:11:25.080 --> 2:11:27.080]  Because the enemies of humanity
[2:11:27.080 --> 2:11:29.080]  Are moving heaven and earth today
[2:11:29.080 --> 2:11:31.080]  To try to stop what you're about to say
[2:11:31.080 --> 2:11:34.080]  Well, thanks for having me back, Alex
[2:11:34.080 --> 2:11:37.080]  Yes, I can only
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:40.080]  I can only confirm what Dr. Zelenko
[2:11:40.080 --> 2:11:43.080]  A really good man just told you
[2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:46.080]  These people are really trying to kill us
[2:11:46.080 --> 2:11:49.080]  They are trying to reduce the population
[2:11:49.080 --> 2:11:51.080]  The world's population
[2:11:51.080 --> 2:11:53.080]  I think what they have in mind
[2:11:53.080 --> 2:11:57.080]  Is reducing us by 80% or so
[2:11:57.080 --> 2:11:59.080]  I don't think they're going to succeed
[2:11:59.080 --> 2:12:01.080]  And we're doing something about this
[2:12:01.080 --> 2:12:03.080]  And that's why we founded
[2:12:03.080 --> 2:12:05.080]  The Corona Investigative Committee
[2:12:05.080 --> 2:12:10.080]  Its website is corona-committee.com
[2:12:10.080 --> 2:12:12.080]  But on top of this
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:16.080]  After we had gotten all these little pieces
[2:12:16.080 --> 2:12:19.080]  Of the puzzle about how the PCR test
[2:12:19.080 --> 2:12:21.080]  Doesn't do what people claim
[2:12:21.080 --> 2:12:24.080]  Or what Fauci and Drustin from Germany
[2:12:24.080 --> 2:12:26.080]  Claim it does
[2:12:26.080 --> 2:12:29.080]  How the vaccines are not necessary
[2:12:29.080 --> 2:12:31.080]  Because we don't have a corona pandemic
[2:12:31.080 --> 2:12:34.080]  Rather, we have a PCR test pandemic
[2:12:34.080 --> 2:12:37.080]  Also, we have alternative methods of treatment
[2:12:37.080 --> 2:12:41.080]  Dr. Zelenko invented the Zelenko protocol
[2:12:41.080 --> 2:12:43.080]  Which works perfectly well
[2:12:43.080 --> 2:12:45.080]  Plus, they're neither effective
[2:12:45.080 --> 2:12:47.080]  Nor are they safe
[2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:50.080]  So we took all these pieces of the puzzle
[2:12:50.080 --> 2:12:53.080]  And decided with a group of international attorneys
[2:12:53.080 --> 2:12:57.080]  To let the people see the entire picture
[2:12:57.080 --> 2:12:59.080]  Through a judicial proceeding
[2:12:59.080 --> 2:13:02.080]  Which is based on the American grand jury proceeding
[2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:05.080]  A suggestion by our colleague Anna Garner
[2:13:05.080 --> 2:13:08.080]  And we had this six-day hearing
[2:13:08.080 --> 2:13:10.080]  We're going to conclude it soon
[2:13:10.080 --> 2:13:13.080]  With closing arguments
[2:13:13.080 --> 2:13:16.080]  And then we're going to go into phase two
[2:13:16.080 --> 2:13:19.080]  We're going to have an actual trial
[2:13:19.080 --> 2:13:22.080]  And we're going to probably
[2:13:22.080 --> 2:13:25.080]  Be able to enforce the judgment
[2:13:25.080 --> 2:13:28.080]  That will hopefully result from this trial
[2:13:28.080 --> 2:13:30.080]  Why am I saying this?
[2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:34.080]  Well, I think it is taking too many chances
[2:13:34.080 --> 2:13:36.080]  To try to bring this case
[2:13:36.080 --> 2:13:39.080]  File it within the system
[2:13:39.080 --> 2:13:42.080]  There are some places where the system still works
[2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:44.080]  In particular in some places in the US
[2:13:44.080 --> 2:13:46.080]  But also in India
[2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:48.080]  But most of the places here in Europe
[2:13:48.080 --> 2:13:50.080]  In particular in Germany are totally corrupted
[2:13:50.080 --> 2:13:52.080]  And infiltrated
[2:13:52.080 --> 2:13:55.080]  So there's no use in getting
[2:13:55.080 --> 2:13:58.080]  One of these systems court to hear these cases
[2:13:58.080 --> 2:14:00.080]  We're not going to get a fair hearing
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:02.080]  So we're going to do this outside of the system
[2:14:02.080 --> 2:14:04.080]  But we still believe
[2:14:04.080 --> 2:14:06.080]  Because it's a real trial with real attorneys
[2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:08.080]  A real judge and a real jury
[2:14:08.080 --> 2:14:10.080]  Which will be our viewers
[2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:12.080]  We still believe we can enforce
[2:14:12.080 --> 2:14:14.080]  The resulting judgment
[2:14:14.080 --> 2:14:16.080]  Because it looks
[2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:18.080]  If you look at Ukraine
[2:14:18.080 --> 2:14:20.080]  Which is just an extension
[2:14:20.080 --> 2:14:22.080]  Of the fearmongering that we've seen
[2:14:22.080 --> 2:14:24.080]  With the corona pandemic
[2:14:24.080 --> 2:14:26.080]  If you look at Ukraine
[2:14:26.080 --> 2:14:28.080]  We're using this in order to keep us
[2:14:28.080 --> 2:14:30.080]  In fear mode and panic mode
[2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:32.080]  In order to go through
[2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:34.080]  With their great reset
[2:14:34.080 --> 2:14:36.080]  Which
[2:14:36.080 --> 2:14:38.080]  What it really
[2:14:38.080 --> 2:14:40.080]  Its real goal is
[2:14:40.080 --> 2:14:42.080]  Is to create a one world government
[2:14:42.080 --> 2:14:44.080]  Because they want to make us believe
[2:14:44.080 --> 2:14:46.080]  There are national governments
[2:14:46.080 --> 2:14:48.080]  Which they're not our national
[2:14:48.080 --> 2:14:50.080]  Our governments anymore
[2:14:50.080 --> 2:14:52.080]  Most of them have been infiltrated
[2:14:52.080 --> 2:14:54.080]  Not all, but most of them have been infiltrated
[2:14:54.080 --> 2:14:56.080]  Our systems through the
[2:14:56.080 --> 2:14:58.080]  World Economic Forum
[2:14:58.080 --> 2:15:00.080]  Which has its own
[2:15:00.080 --> 2:15:02.080]  Production capacity
[2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:04.080]  In
[2:15:04.080 --> 2:15:06.080]  In terms of their
[2:15:06.080 --> 2:15:08.080]  Young global leaders
[2:15:08.080 --> 2:15:10.080]  Program
[2:15:10.080 --> 2:15:12.080]  So we do believe that
[2:15:12.080 --> 2:15:14.080]  Things are going to come to a head
[2:15:14.080 --> 2:15:16.080]  Probably in the fall
[2:15:16.080 --> 2:15:18.080]  You can't make any precise predictions
[2:15:18.080 --> 2:15:20.080]  But based on the testimony
[2:15:20.080 --> 2:15:22.080]  That we got from geopoliticians
[2:15:22.080 --> 2:15:24.080]  Based on what we think
[2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:26.080]  Is really happening in Ukraine
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:28.080]  It's very hard to tell
[2:15:28.080 --> 2:15:30.080]  Because there's propaganda on both sides
[2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:32.080]  But the one side that we're being presented
[2:15:32.080 --> 2:15:34.080]  Is the one that is presented
[2:15:34.080 --> 2:15:36.080]  To us by the same people who've been lying
[2:15:36.080 --> 2:15:38.080]  To us about corona
[2:15:38.080 --> 2:15:40.080]  The mainstream media
[2:15:40.080 --> 2:15:42.080]  That's right, Dr. Reiner-Fulmick
[2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:44.080]  Stay right there, we're going to come back
[2:15:44.080 --> 2:15:46.080]  And lay this out, but it's just
[2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:48.080]  An incredible time to be alive
[2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:50.080]  Huge awakenings happening, they're acting
[2:15:50.080 --> 2:15:52.080]  They're waiting in the wings
[2:15:52.080 --> 2:15:54.080]  So it's so important to continue to hammer this truth
[2:15:54.080 --> 2:16:23.080]  And I'll be back, please stay with us.

[2:16:41.080 --> 2:16:42.080]  The InfoWars operation
[2:16:42.080 --> 2:16:44.080]  It is a 360 win
[2:16:44.080 --> 2:16:45.080]  The only way you fail
[2:16:45.080 --> 2:16:47.080]  Is by not taking action
[2:16:47.080 --> 2:16:48.080]  And getting this product
[2:16:48.080 --> 2:16:49.080]  To boost your body's natural defenses
[2:16:49.080 --> 2:16:51.080]  And keep InfoWars on the air
[2:16:51.080 --> 2:16:52.080]  The globalists are hoping
[2:16:52.080 --> 2:16:53.080]  You don't take action
[2:16:53.080 --> 2:16:54.080]  Take action now

[2:17:24.080 --> 2:17:26.080]  Suppressing the voices
[2:17:26.080 --> 2:17:28.080]  Of good people all around the world
[2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:30.080]  And of doctors and scientists
[2:17:30.080 --> 2:17:31.080]  And engineers
[2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:33.080]  That are exposing all their lies
[2:17:33.080 --> 2:17:35.080]  Their COVID hysteria
[2:17:35.080 --> 2:17:37.080]  Their world's gonna end in 2030
[2:17:37.080 --> 2:17:39.080]  Carbon tax, global warming bull
[2:17:39.080 --> 2:17:40.080]  All of it
[2:17:40.080 --> 2:17:42.080]  And none of it can succeed
[2:17:42.080 --> 2:17:44.080]  None of it can actually be carried out
[2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:47.080]  Unless everybody is silenced and gaslit
[2:17:47.080 --> 2:17:49.080]  And that's why truth comes
[2:17:49.080 --> 2:17:50.080]  With hard work
[2:17:50.080 --> 2:17:51.080]  And with research and with diligence
[2:17:51.080 --> 2:17:52.080]  And that's why it's hard
[2:17:52.080 --> 2:17:53.080]  To share InfoWars links
[2:17:53.080 --> 2:17:55.080]  And Bandai video links
[2:17:55.080 --> 2:17:56.080]  That's why we've got to share them now
[2:17:56.080 --> 2:17:57.080]  More than ever
[2:17:57.080 --> 2:17:58.080]  The first ten amendments
[2:17:58.080 --> 2:18:00.080]  To our country's constitution
[2:18:00.080 --> 2:18:02.080]  Were adopted in 1791
[2:18:02.080 --> 2:18:04.080]  The first of these broadly protects
[2:18:04.080 --> 2:18:06.080]  The rights of free speech
[2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:07.080]  And free press
[2:18:07.080 --> 2:18:09.080]  Free speech means the free
[2:18:09.080 --> 2:18:11.080]  And public expression of opinions
[2:18:11.080 --> 2:18:14.080]  Without censorship, interference
[2:18:14.080 --> 2:18:16.080]  And restraint by the government
[2:18:16.080 --> 2:18:18.080]  231 years later
[2:18:18.080 --> 2:18:20.080]  Free speech across America
[2:18:20.080 --> 2:18:22.080]  Is under chronic and insidious attack
[2:18:22.080 --> 2:18:25.080]  GCN is under attack
[2:18:25.080 --> 2:18:27.080]  Your freedom is currently under siege
[2:18:27.080 --> 2:18:30.080]  From those who do not want you to know the truth
[2:18:30.080 --> 2:18:32.080]  I'm asking our fellow broadcasters
[2:18:32.080 --> 2:18:34.080]  And you to rise up
[2:18:34.080 --> 2:18:36.080]  And help us defend our right
[2:18:36.080 --> 2:18:38.080]  To continue telling you the truth
[2:18:38.080 --> 2:18:40.080]  Would you like to join us?

[2:18:52.080 --> 2:18:54.080]  You may select all of those choices
[2:18:54.080 --> 2:18:56.080]  I'm Vincent Finnelli
[2:18:56.080 --> 2:18:59.080]  If I had to describe
[2:18:59.080 --> 2:19:01.080]  With just one word
[2:19:01.080 --> 2:19:03.080]  The brainwashing
[2:19:03.080 --> 2:19:05.080]  The mind control
[2:19:05.080 --> 2:19:08.080]  The asleep prince
[2:19:08.080 --> 2:19:10.080]  That the general public is in
[2:19:10.080 --> 2:19:12.080]  The best word would actually be
[2:19:12.080 --> 2:19:14.080]  The people are lost
[2:19:14.080 --> 2:19:16.080]  Just like you're lost to sleep
[2:19:16.080 --> 2:19:18.080]  Or lost in a bad nightmare
[2:19:18.080 --> 2:19:19.080]  Or you're in a horror
[2:19:19.080 --> 2:19:21.080]  Or you get knocked out
[2:19:21.080 --> 2:19:23.080]  And you've lost your bearings
[2:19:23.080 --> 2:19:27.080]  Because you are totally dizzy
[2:19:27.080 --> 2:19:28.080]  And confused
[2:19:28.080 --> 2:19:29.080]  You have a concussion
[2:19:29.080 --> 2:19:31.080]  And that's what the globalists have done
[2:19:31.080 --> 2:19:33.080]  They have stunned us
[2:19:33.080 --> 2:19:35.080]  They have put us into a position
[2:19:35.080 --> 2:19:36.080]  Of not knowing our bearings
[2:19:36.080 --> 2:19:38.080]  And then Klaus Schwab recently came out
[2:19:38.080 --> 2:19:39.080]  And gave speech
[2:19:39.080 --> 2:19:40.080]  He called the great new narrative
[2:19:40.080 --> 2:19:42.080]  Where he brags how the public is lost
[2:19:42.080 --> 2:19:44.080]  How the culture and the media
[2:19:44.080 --> 2:19:46.080]  Has been driven to make sure
[2:19:46.080 --> 2:19:47.080]  The people are all alone
[2:19:47.080 --> 2:19:49.080]  So they can now guide humanity
[2:19:49.080 --> 2:19:50.080]  Over the edge of a cliff
[2:19:50.080 --> 2:19:51.080]  That's what the great reset is
[2:19:51.080 --> 2:19:53.080]  They need darkness to thrive
[2:19:53.080 --> 2:19:55.080]  The light lives at
[2:19:55.080 --> 2:20:18.080]  TheWars.com
[2:20:18.080 --> 2:20:19.080]  Well, you can pull up
[2:20:19.080 --> 2:20:21.080]  A State Department CIA document
[2:20:21.080 --> 2:20:23.080]  From the late 60s
[2:20:23.080 --> 2:20:24.080]  Under different titles
[2:20:24.080 --> 2:20:26.080]  But it's 198 ways
[2:20:26.080 --> 2:20:28.080]  To peacefully resist
[2:20:28.080 --> 2:20:29.080]  Another headline gives you
[2:20:29.080 --> 2:20:31.080]  The same CIA plan
[2:20:31.080 --> 2:20:34.080]  It's 198 ways
[2:20:34.080 --> 2:20:36.080]  For civil disobedience
[2:20:36.080 --> 2:20:38.080]  Another one's 198 ways
[2:20:38.080 --> 2:20:40.080]  Of nonviolent action
[2:20:40.080 --> 2:20:42.080]  And one of the biggest ones
[2:20:42.080 --> 2:20:44.080]  Which they didn't invent this
[2:20:44.080 --> 2:20:45.080]  Or just listing it
[2:20:45.080 --> 2:20:46.080]  Is a mock trial
[2:20:46.080 --> 2:20:48.080]  Or a grand jury
[2:20:48.080 --> 2:20:49.080]  With real scientists
[2:20:49.080 --> 2:20:50.080]  Real lawyers
[2:20:50.080 --> 2:20:51.080]  Real people
[2:20:51.080 --> 2:20:52.080]  You put on the evidence
[2:20:52.080 --> 2:20:54.080]  As a blueprint for others to do it
[2:20:54.080 --> 2:20:56.080]  In fact, I've seen political
[2:20:56.080 --> 2:20:57.080]  Scientists point out that
[2:20:57.080 --> 2:20:59.080]  The mock trial
[2:20:59.080 --> 2:21:00.080]  Or the mock grand jury
[2:21:00.080 --> 2:21:01.080]  Is one of the most important
[2:21:01.080 --> 2:21:03.080]  I saw the enemy disinfo agents
[2:21:03.080 --> 2:21:05.080]  Go crazy months ago
[2:21:05.080 --> 2:21:07.080]  When very famous, successful
[2:21:07.080 --> 2:21:08.080]  Respected attorney
[2:21:08.080 --> 2:21:10.080]  Dr. Reiner Fulmick
[2:21:10.080 --> 2:21:11.080]  Came out and did this
[2:21:11.080 --> 2:21:12.080]  They said, oh, he's claiming
[2:21:12.080 --> 2:21:14.080]  It's a real trial
[2:21:14.080 --> 2:21:15.080]  Well, no, it's a real presentation
[2:21:15.080 --> 2:21:17.080]  Of evidence to get
[2:21:17.080 --> 2:21:18.080]  A real investigation
[2:21:18.080 --> 2:21:21.080]  So that you see that deception
[2:21:21.080 --> 2:21:23.080]  Because they're so scared
[2:21:23.080 --> 2:21:25.080]  Of something real like this
[2:21:25.080 --> 2:21:26.080]  Where we put these people
[2:21:26.080 --> 2:21:27.080]  On trial every day too
[2:21:27.080 --> 2:21:28.080]  Showing you all this stuff
[2:21:28.080 --> 2:21:29.080]  That's what this is
[2:21:29.080 --> 2:21:30.080]  Everything in life is a trial
[2:21:30.080 --> 2:21:31.080]  You go to a restaurant
[2:21:31.080 --> 2:21:32.080]  It's a food good
[2:21:32.080 --> 2:21:33.080]  You buy a suit
[2:21:33.080 --> 2:21:34.080]  Does it fit well?
[2:21:34.080 --> 2:21:35.080]  Does it last?
[2:21:35.080 --> 2:21:36.080]  You buy a car
[2:21:36.080 --> 2:21:37.080]  Everything's a trial in life
[2:21:37.080 --> 2:21:38.080]  So he's really pioneered this
[2:21:38.080 --> 2:21:39.080]  And what matters is
[2:21:39.080 --> 2:21:40.080]  He did a great job
[2:21:40.080 --> 2:21:41.080]  They were very truthful
[2:21:41.080 --> 2:21:42.080]  Very accurate
[2:21:42.080 --> 2:21:44.080]  And it got seen
[2:21:44.080 --> 2:21:46.080]  Conservatively, where I saw it
[2:21:46.080 --> 2:21:47.080]  20, 30, 40 million times
[2:21:47.080 --> 2:21:48.080]  So he started with us
[2:21:48.080 --> 2:21:49.080]  Till the end of the hour
[2:21:49.080 --> 2:21:51.080]  And he's got so much to say
[2:21:51.080 --> 2:21:52.080]  About where we are
[2:21:52.080 --> 2:21:54.080]  But if I had to pick two people
[2:21:54.080 --> 2:21:55.080]  Been on the show in the last few years
[2:21:55.080 --> 2:21:57.080]  Who just have a way of saying things
[2:21:57.080 --> 2:21:58.080]  It's Dr. Zelinko
[2:21:58.080 --> 2:22:00.080]  And it's Reiner Fulmink
[2:22:00.080 --> 2:22:02.080]  Just the way they describe things
[2:22:02.080 --> 2:22:03.080]  Is just so dead on
[2:22:03.080 --> 2:22:05.080]  And I'm not praising you, sir
[2:22:05.080 --> 2:22:06.080]  To get accolade
[2:22:06.080 --> 2:22:07.080]  I'm just saying
[2:22:07.080 --> 2:22:09.080]  I really respect your view
[2:22:09.080 --> 2:22:10.080]  On this and where we're going
[2:22:10.080 --> 2:22:12.080]  Because it seems you're
[2:22:12.080 --> 2:22:13.080]  Gulled into the zeitgeist
[2:22:13.080 --> 2:22:14.080]  So just wherever you want to go
[2:22:14.080 --> 2:22:15.080]  Please continue
[2:22:15.080 --> 2:22:17.080]  Well, thanks, Alex
[2:22:17.080 --> 2:22:18.080]  That's heaping too much praise
[2:22:18.080 --> 2:22:19.080]  On me
[2:22:19.080 --> 2:22:20.080]  We're a group of attorneys
[2:22:20.080 --> 2:22:22.080]  We're about 30 attorneys
[2:22:22.080 --> 2:22:23.080]  From all over the world
[2:22:23.080 --> 2:22:25.080]  Including South Africa
[2:22:25.080 --> 2:22:27.080]  The United States, Canada, France,
[2:22:27.080 --> 2:22:29.080]  Italy, many, many other countries
[2:22:29.080 --> 2:22:30.080]  India
[2:22:30.080 --> 2:22:32.080]  And it's only the fact
[2:22:32.080 --> 2:22:34.080]  That we're all connected
[2:22:34.080 --> 2:22:36.080]  And we're all in it for the cause
[2:22:36.080 --> 2:22:37.080]  No one's in it for money
[2:22:37.080 --> 2:22:38.080]  Because we're not making anything
[2:22:38.080 --> 2:22:39.080]  That's the power
[2:22:39.080 --> 2:22:41.080]  Is this college of people
[2:22:41.080 --> 2:22:42.080]  Coming together
[2:22:42.080 --> 2:22:44.080]  Yes, it's incredible
[2:22:44.080 --> 2:22:46.080]  But the way that this connection
[2:22:46.080 --> 2:22:48.080]  Seems to be working
[2:22:48.080 --> 2:22:50.080]  It's almost like
[2:22:50.080 --> 2:22:52.080]  I don't know, magic
[2:22:52.080 --> 2:22:54.080]  Maybe you can call it that
[2:22:54.080 --> 2:22:56.080]  Synergy
[2:22:56.080 --> 2:22:58.080]  Yeah, that's what it is
[2:22:58.080 --> 2:23:00.080]  It creates synergies
[2:23:00.080 --> 2:23:01.080]  There's so much
[2:23:01.080 --> 2:23:03.080]  We really like each other
[2:23:03.080 --> 2:23:04.080]  We get along with each other
[2:23:04.080 --> 2:23:08.080]  We're all doing the same thing
[2:23:08.080 --> 2:23:09.080]  And have been doing this
[2:23:09.080 --> 2:23:10.080]  For a long time
[2:23:10.080 --> 2:23:11.080]  And we don't care
[2:23:11.080 --> 2:23:15.080]  How many people try to disparage us
[2:23:15.080 --> 2:23:17.080]  Or try to
[2:23:17.080 --> 2:23:19.080]  Even cause us serious problems
[2:23:19.080 --> 2:23:20.080]  You may have heard
[2:23:20.080 --> 2:23:22.080]  That our French colleague
[2:23:22.080 --> 2:23:25.080]  Virginie was arrested last week
[2:23:25.080 --> 2:23:26.080]  Yes, I meant to bring that up
[2:23:26.080 --> 2:23:27.080]  Tell people about that
[2:23:27.080 --> 2:23:28.080]  There's video of this
[2:23:28.080 --> 2:23:30.080]  Yeah, tell us about it
[2:23:30.080 --> 2:23:32.080]  Yeah, she was arrested
[2:23:32.080 --> 2:23:33.080]  Early in the morning
[2:23:33.080 --> 2:23:36.080]  Her two very young children
[2:23:36.080 --> 2:23:39.080]  Unfortunately had to witness this
[2:23:39.080 --> 2:23:42.080]  She was held in custody
[2:23:42.080 --> 2:23:44.080]  For I think three days
[2:23:44.080 --> 2:23:45.080]  It didn't have anything to do
[2:23:45.080 --> 2:23:46.080]  With her participation
[2:23:46.080 --> 2:23:49.080]  In the grand jury investigation
[2:23:49.080 --> 2:23:51.080]  Rather, they claimed that
[2:23:51.080 --> 2:23:53.080]  She was being held in custody
[2:23:53.080 --> 2:23:54.080]  And questioned
[2:23:54.080 --> 2:23:56.080]  Because she was advising
[2:23:56.080 --> 2:23:59.080]  Or representing a terrorist
[2:23:59.080 --> 2:24:01.080]  Well, turns out the terrorist
[2:24:01.080 --> 2:24:03.080]  Is just somebody who's asking questions
[2:24:03.080 --> 2:24:05.080]  And that's why they framed him
[2:24:05.080 --> 2:24:06.080]  As a terrorist
[2:24:06.080 --> 2:24:07.080]  Wow
[2:24:07.080 --> 2:24:09.080]  In any fact, we don't think
[2:24:09.080 --> 2:24:11.080]  That there wasn't any cause
[2:24:11.080 --> 2:24:12.080]  For this
[2:24:12.080 --> 2:24:15.080]  But what this really meant to do
[2:24:15.080 --> 2:24:16.080]  Is send a message
[2:24:16.080 --> 2:24:18.080]  To the other attorneys in France
[2:24:18.080 --> 2:24:21.080]  Because they can't intimidate her
[2:24:21.080 --> 2:24:23.080]  A message of fear
[2:24:23.080 --> 2:24:26.080]  If you're not in line with the government
[2:24:26.080 --> 2:24:28.080]  Then we're going to go after you
[2:24:28.080 --> 2:24:30.080]  Something very similar happened
[2:24:30.080 --> 2:24:32.080]  In Germany about a year ago
[2:24:32.080 --> 2:24:35.080]  When a judge in the city of Weimar
[2:24:35.080 --> 2:24:37.080]  Simply applied the law
[2:24:37.080 --> 2:24:39.080]  A mother of two underage children
[2:24:39.080 --> 2:24:41.080]  Seven and nine years old
[2:24:41.080 --> 2:24:43.080]  Came to him and asked for his help
[2:24:43.080 --> 2:24:45.080]  And said, my children can't sleep
[2:24:45.080 --> 2:24:46.080]  They have stomach aches
[2:24:46.080 --> 2:24:48.080]  They are crying at night
[2:24:48.080 --> 2:24:50.080]  They don't want to go to school anymore
[2:24:50.080 --> 2:24:52.080]  They feel they're being tortured
[2:24:52.080 --> 2:24:54.080]  This constant PCR testing
[2:24:54.080 --> 2:24:55.080]  The mass mandates
[2:24:55.080 --> 2:24:56.080]  Social distancing
[2:24:56.080 --> 2:24:58.080]  They want to play and they can't
[2:24:58.080 --> 2:24:59.080]  So the judge said, well
[2:24:59.080 --> 2:25:01.080]  I'm going to have to get some experts
[2:25:01.080 --> 2:25:04.080]  Expert witnesses to help me out on this
[2:25:04.080 --> 2:25:06.080]  And he got in touch with three
[2:25:06.080 --> 2:25:09.080]  Renowned professors from renowned universities
[2:25:09.080 --> 2:25:11.080]  One PCR test expert
[2:25:11.080 --> 2:25:14.080]  Another one child psychologist
[2:25:14.080 --> 2:25:16.080]  And another one a third person
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:18.080]  Who specializes in mass
[2:25:18.080 --> 2:25:21.080]  Based on their evidence
[2:25:21.080 --> 2:25:22.080]  On their expert opinions
[2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:24.080]  He decided this is illegal
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:25.080]  This is unconstitutional
[2:25:25.080 --> 2:25:28.080]  And ordered the school to stop
[2:25:28.080 --> 2:25:30.080]  These practices
[2:25:30.080 --> 2:25:32.080]  So this is perfectly normal
[2:25:32.080 --> 2:25:33.080]  Three weeks later
[2:25:33.080 --> 2:25:36.080]  His house, his office, his car
[2:25:36.080 --> 2:25:39.080]  Was searched, his phone
[2:25:39.080 --> 2:25:42.080]  His cell phone and his computer
[2:25:42.080 --> 2:25:44.080]  Were seized
[2:25:44.080 --> 2:25:46.080]  Same thing happened to the three experts
[2:25:46.080 --> 2:25:49.080]  Same thing happened to a friend of the judge
[2:25:49.080 --> 2:25:51.080]  Simply because she was a friend of his
[2:25:51.080 --> 2:25:53.080]  Same thing happened to a colleague
[2:25:53.080 --> 2:25:56.080]  Same thing happened to the lawyer
[2:25:56.080 --> 2:25:58.080]  Who represented the children
[2:25:58.080 --> 2:26:00.080]  So this is what you're seeing
[2:26:00.080 --> 2:26:02.080]  Pretty much everywhere in Europe
[2:26:02.080 --> 2:26:04.080]  And apparently in some other places as well
[2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:06.080]  However, it's not going to do the trick
[2:26:06.080 --> 2:26:08.080]  Because it's only making people
[2:26:08.080 --> 2:26:10.080]  More and more angry
[2:26:10.080 --> 2:26:13.080]  And making people ask questions
[2:26:13.080 --> 2:26:15.080]  We're going to continue with our work
[2:26:15.080 --> 2:26:16.080]  That's why we're really soon
[2:26:16.080 --> 2:26:18.080]  We're going to have a strategy meeting
[2:26:18.080 --> 2:26:21.080]  Tomorrow at our Berlin headquarters
[2:26:21.080 --> 2:26:24.080]  And we're probably going to very soon
[2:26:24.080 --> 2:26:26.080]  Start phase, start with phase one
[2:26:26.080 --> 2:26:28.080]  I'm sorry, two
[2:26:28.080 --> 2:26:30.080]  Phase one was the investigation
[2:26:30.080 --> 2:26:32.080]  It was a real investigation
[2:26:32.080 --> 2:26:34.080]  It was simply held outside the system
[2:26:34.080 --> 2:26:36.080]  But there's going to be a phase true
[2:26:36.080 --> 2:26:38.080]  And that's going to be a real trial
[2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:39.080]  And as I said earlier
[2:26:39.080 --> 2:26:44.080]  We believe that towards the fall
[2:26:44.080 --> 2:26:46.080]  Things are going to come to a head
[2:26:46.080 --> 2:26:49.080]  There may even be outright war
[2:26:49.080 --> 2:26:51.080]  We hope we can still avoid it
[2:26:51.080 --> 2:26:54.080]  But I'm not very optimistic about this
[2:26:54.080 --> 2:26:56.080]  So after that
[2:26:56.080 --> 2:26:58.080]  After that collapse or crash
[2:26:58.080 --> 2:27:00.080]  Or maybe it's going to be World War III
[2:27:00.080 --> 2:27:02.080]  We don't know
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:04.080]  But things are looking really, really bad
[2:27:04.080 --> 2:27:05.080]  Right now
[2:27:05.080 --> 2:27:06.080]  After that, however
[2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:08.080]  We're going to be able to enforce
[2:27:08.080 --> 2:27:09.080]  Any judgment
[2:27:09.080 --> 2:27:11.080]  Because after that
[2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:13.080]  It's going to be the 20% of the people
[2:27:13.080 --> 2:27:15.080]  Maybe 30% of the people
[2:27:15.080 --> 2:27:17.080]  Who have always been in the resistance
[2:27:17.080 --> 2:27:19.080]  Who will, most of them
[2:27:19.080 --> 2:27:21.080]  We believe will survive
[2:27:21.080 --> 2:27:23.080]  So I'm not trying to be
[2:27:23.080 --> 2:27:24.080]  You're right
[2:27:24.080 --> 2:27:26.080]  We're in a war with globalists
[2:27:26.080 --> 2:27:27.080]  This is a total war
[2:27:27.080 --> 2:27:29.080]  And what's incredible is I see Fauci
[2:27:29.080 --> 2:27:32.080]  And I see the head of Pfizer and others
[2:27:32.080 --> 2:27:34.080]  Now backtracking and saying
[2:27:34.080 --> 2:27:36.080]  Oh, we were just told to do this
[2:27:36.080 --> 2:27:38.080]  So I see a lot of signs that they admit
[2:27:38.080 --> 2:27:39.080]  They're in deep trouble
[2:27:39.080 --> 2:27:41.080]  Plus the fact that they're hardly seen
[2:27:41.080 --> 2:27:42.080]  In public now
[2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:43.080]  I mean, that really
[2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:45.080]  Why did they suddenly back off
[2:27:45.080 --> 2:27:46.080]  Just a few months ago
[2:27:46.080 --> 2:27:47.080]  When they were pushing
[2:27:47.080 --> 2:27:50.080]  Because they saw so much resistance?
[2:27:50.080 --> 2:27:51.080]  I think so
[2:27:51.080 --> 2:27:52.080]  I think they
[2:27:52.080 --> 2:27:55.080]  I do think this is part of their game plan
[2:27:55.080 --> 2:27:57.080]  However, because they must have expected
[2:27:57.080 --> 2:28:00.080]  That quite a few of us
[2:28:00.080 --> 2:28:02.080]  Will not back down
[2:28:02.080 --> 2:28:04.080]  And more and more people are waking up
[2:28:04.080 --> 2:28:05.080]  That's why they're looking
[2:28:05.080 --> 2:28:07.080]  And they had this
[2:28:07.080 --> 2:28:09.080]  They had this as part of their game plan
[2:28:09.080 --> 2:28:11.080]  We believe right from the start
[2:28:11.080 --> 2:28:13.080]  That's why they're moving
[2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:14.080]  Into their second phase
[2:28:14.080 --> 2:28:15.080]  Which is Ukraine
[2:28:15.080 --> 2:28:17.080]  The war in Ukraine
[2:28:17.080 --> 2:28:18.080]  Well, that's right
[2:28:18.080 --> 2:28:19.080]  Stay there
[2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:20.080]  Show how you astute you are
[2:28:20.080 --> 2:28:21.080]  Some people don't know this
[2:28:21.080 --> 2:28:22.080]  It's in their different battle plans
[2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:23.080]  Like the Spars document
[2:28:23.080 --> 2:28:25.080]  That they know will push back
[2:28:25.080 --> 2:28:26.080]  They'll give up for a little bit
[2:28:26.080 --> 2:28:28.080]  And then hammer down
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:29.080]  Next with what?
[2:28:29.080 --> 2:28:30.080]  Hemorrhagic fever
[2:28:30.080 --> 2:28:31.080]  God knows what
[2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:33.080]  Dr. Reiner Fulmick is with us
[2:28:33.080 --> 2:28:35.080]  You should definitely visit his site
[2:28:35.080 --> 2:28:37.080]  He gave a new site out there
[2:28:37.080 --> 2:28:39.080]  Everybody should visit on screen
[2:28:39.080 --> 2:28:40.080]  We'll put that on screen
[2:28:40.080 --> 2:28:41.080]  Fulmick.com
[2:28:41.080 --> 2:28:42.080]  Crimes Against Humanity
[2:28:42.080 --> 2:28:43.080]  Tour.com
[2:28:43.080 --> 2:28:44.080]  And more
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:46.080]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen
[2:28:46.080 --> 2:28:58.080]  History is happening right now
[2:28:58.080 --> 2:29:00.080]  In December of 2021
[2:29:00.080 --> 2:29:02.080]  Info Wars offered the first
[2:29:02.080 --> 2:29:04.080]  In a three-part series
[2:29:04.080 --> 2:29:07.080]  The 1776 Anti-Tyrant Coin
[2:29:07.080 --> 2:29:09.080]  And it sold out in 10 days
[2:29:09.080 --> 2:29:11.080]  And if it wasn't for listeners
[2:29:11.080 --> 2:29:13.080]  Getting this original powerful coin
[2:29:13.080 --> 2:29:15.080]  A founding member coin
[2:29:15.080 --> 2:29:17.080]  Would not be on air today
[2:29:17.080 --> 2:29:19.080]  Now, the second coin
[2:29:19.080 --> 2:29:22.080]  The Liberty Tree Coin is being offered
[2:29:22.080 --> 2:29:23.080]  And it will probably sell out
[2:29:23.080 --> 2:29:25.080]  In 10 days again
[2:29:25.080 --> 2:29:26.080]  It certainly needs to
[2:29:26.080 --> 2:29:27.080]  To further operation
[2:29:27.080 --> 2:29:29.080]  It is so historic
[2:29:29.080 --> 2:29:31.080]  And it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson
[2:29:31.080 --> 2:29:33.080]  About the Tree of Liberty being refreshed
[2:29:33.080 --> 2:29:35.080]  With the blood of Patriots and Tyrants
[2:29:35.080 --> 2:29:36.080]  And more
[2:29:36.080 --> 2:29:37.080]  See the coin for yourself
[2:29:37.080 --> 2:29:40.080]  At 1776coin.com
[2:29:40.080 --> 2:29:42.080]  It's also at infowarstore.com
[2:29:42.080 --> 2:29:43.080]  It's amazing
[2:29:43.080 --> 2:29:45.080]  There's only 10,000 of them
[2:29:45.080 --> 2:29:46.080]  And as a founding member
[2:29:46.080 --> 2:29:48.080]  If we're able to stay on the air
[2:29:48.080 --> 2:29:49.080]  We're planning something
[2:29:49.080 --> 2:29:51.080]  Very, very special for everyone
[2:29:51.080 --> 2:29:53.080]  That helps us go to the next level
[2:29:53.080 --> 2:29:55.080]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin
[2:29:55.080 --> 2:29:56.080]  While you still can
[2:29:56.080 --> 2:29:58.080]  At 1776coin.com
[2:29:58.080 --> 2:30:00.080]  So I did it
[2:30:00.080 --> 2:30:02.080]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon
[2:30:02.080 --> 2:30:03.080]  I've been training
[2:30:03.080 --> 2:30:05.080]  Probably not as much as they should be
[2:30:05.080 --> 2:30:07.080]  But thank goodness for prayer
[2:30:07.080 --> 2:30:09.080]  And thank goodness for infowarstore.com
[2:30:09.080 --> 2:30:11.080]  Before I set out on a run
[2:30:11.080 --> 2:30:13.080]  I throw down some turbo force
[2:30:13.080 --> 2:30:15.080]  To give me that energy I need
[2:30:15.080 --> 2:30:16.080]  To get going, you know
[2:30:16.080 --> 2:30:18.080]  Besides the energy, turbo force
[2:30:18.080 --> 2:30:20.080]  It is giving me the vitamins I need
[2:30:20.080 --> 2:30:22.080]  Like vitamin C to keep me healthy
[2:30:22.080 --> 2:30:24.080]  And the essential B vitamins
[2:30:24.080 --> 2:30:26.080]  Plus the amino acids for sustained energy
[2:30:26.080 --> 2:30:27.080]  Giving me the best chance
[2:30:27.080 --> 2:30:29.080]  At getting through the training
[2:30:29.080 --> 2:30:30.080]  And then every day now
[2:30:30.080 --> 2:30:32.080]  I'm taking Dr. Jones' sore list
[2:30:32.080 --> 2:30:34.080]  I have bad joints, thanks mom
[2:30:34.080 --> 2:30:36.080]  So this is great for giving my joints
[2:30:36.080 --> 2:30:38.080]  The extra support they need right now
[2:30:38.080 --> 2:30:40.080]  Plus inflammation support
[2:30:40.080 --> 2:30:42.080]  And extra flexibility
[2:30:42.080 --> 2:30:44.080]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast
[2:30:44.080 --> 2:30:46.080]  So I can get back to the training
[2:30:46.080 --> 2:30:48.080]  Even if you're not crazy enough
[2:30:48.080 --> 2:30:50.080]  To take on a marathon, good news
[2:30:50.080 --> 2:30:52.080]  Turbo force, that can still give you the energy
[2:30:52.080 --> 2:30:54.080]  And clarity you need for every day
[2:30:54.080 --> 2:30:56.080]  And sore list can keep you moving
[2:30:56.080 --> 2:30:58.080]  And feeling great at any age
[2:30:58.080 --> 2:30:59.080]  Ladies and gentlemen
[2:30:59.080 --> 2:31:01.080]  infowarstore.com
[2:31:01.080 --> 2:31:03.080]  Is offering the biggest sales

[2:31:06.080 --> 2:31:08.080]  And that is because
[2:31:08.080 --> 2:31:10.080]  The economy is breaking down
[2:31:10.080 --> 2:31:11.080]  Inflation is exploding
[2:31:11.080 --> 2:31:13.080]  The supply chains have broken down
[2:31:13.080 --> 2:31:15.080]  And info wars is having serious
[2:31:15.080 --> 2:31:17.080]  Trouble making its payroll
[2:31:17.080 --> 2:31:19.080]  And paying for operations
[2:31:19.080 --> 2:31:21.080]  And I do not want to implode or downsize
[2:31:21.080 --> 2:31:23.080]  In the face of the globalists
[2:31:23.080 --> 2:31:24.080]  Making their main move
[2:31:24.080 --> 2:31:26.080]  Info wars, it's paradoxical

[2:31:30.080 --> 2:31:32.080]  But because of cost increasing
[2:31:32.080 --> 2:31:33.080]  And having to run our own infrastructure
[2:31:33.080 --> 2:31:35.080]  And pay for our own bandwidth and everything else

[2:32:06.080 --> 2:32:08.080]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs
[2:32:08.080 --> 2:32:10.080]  In the natural health world today
[2:32:10.080 --> 2:32:12.080]  Though it has been used for hundreds of years
[2:32:12.080 --> 2:32:13.080]  In the Pacific Islands
[2:32:13.080 --> 2:32:16.080]  For its relaxation and euphoric effects
[2:32:16.080 --> 2:32:18.080]  According to ancient Samoan legend
[2:32:18.080 --> 2:32:20.080]  Kava was given as a gift
[2:32:20.080 --> 2:32:22.080]  By the sun god Tagaloa
[2:32:22.080 --> 2:32:24.080]  Who they considered to be the supreme ruler
[2:32:24.080 --> 2:32:26.080]  And creator of the universe
[2:32:26.080 --> 2:32:28.080]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea
[2:32:28.080 --> 2:32:31.080]  During social gatherings and sacred ceremonies
[2:32:31.080 --> 2:32:32.080]  To loosen up a little
[2:32:32.080 --> 2:32:34.080]  Nowadays Kava is used around the world
[2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:37.080]  By many who enjoy its serious benefits
[2:32:37.080 --> 2:32:39.080]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones

[2:32:41.080 --> 2:32:43.080]  Of not only Kava Kava

[2:33:13.080 --> 2:33:15.080]  The answer to 1984

[2:33:20.080 --> 2:33:23.080]  Broadcasting worldwide
[2:33:23.080 --> 2:33:25.080]  It's Alex Jones
[2:33:25.080 --> 2:33:27.080]  So, Dr. Reiner Fulmick
[2:33:27.080 --> 2:33:29.080]  One of the top lawyers out there
[2:33:29.080 --> 2:33:31.080]  Exposing this incredible power grab
[2:33:31.080 --> 2:33:33.080]  This Nuremberg violating code
[2:33:33.080 --> 2:33:35.080]  This insanity
[2:33:35.080 --> 2:33:36.080]  Please continue
[2:33:36.080 --> 2:33:37.080]  I could ask a lot of questions
[2:33:37.080 --> 2:33:39.080]  But you're really educated on this
[2:33:39.080 --> 2:33:41.080]  What do you expect to come next?
[2:33:41.080 --> 2:33:42.080]  What can we do?
[2:33:42.080 --> 2:33:43.080]  What's unfolding?
[2:33:43.080 --> 2:33:45.080]  Why have they backed off a little bit?
[2:33:45.080 --> 2:33:46.080]  Is that a sign of weakness?
[2:33:46.080 --> 2:33:48.080]  What do you expect next?
[2:33:48.080 --> 2:33:50.080]  No, I completely agree with you
[2:33:50.080 --> 2:33:51.080]  They're not...
[2:33:51.080 --> 2:33:53.080]  This is not a sign of weakness
[2:33:53.080 --> 2:33:55.080]  They're just letting go
[2:33:55.080 --> 2:33:57.080]  Of the rains for a short while
[2:33:57.080 --> 2:33:59.080]  And then they're gonna pull back hard again
[2:33:59.080 --> 2:34:03.080]  This is part of their deliberate attempt
[2:34:03.080 --> 2:34:07.080]  To confuse, disorient, distract us
[2:34:07.080 --> 2:34:11.080]  It's meant to make people so disoriented
[2:34:11.080 --> 2:34:13.080]  That ultimately they're gonna agree
[2:34:13.080 --> 2:34:15.080]  To anything that they tell us
[2:34:15.080 --> 2:34:17.080]  They being the people who are pulling the strings
[2:34:17.080 --> 2:34:20.080]  Of the Anglo-American financial mafia
[2:34:20.080 --> 2:34:23.080]  Which is based in the city of London
[2:34:23.080 --> 2:34:25.080]  Not London, but the city of London
[2:34:25.080 --> 2:34:28.080]  And it's fifth column in the US
[2:34:28.080 --> 2:34:29.080]  That's Wall Street
[2:34:29.080 --> 2:34:31.080]  We see some of the people
[2:34:31.080 --> 2:34:33.080]  Who are pulling the strings
[2:34:33.080 --> 2:34:35.080]  Including maybe Bill Gates
[2:34:35.080 --> 2:34:37.080]  But maybe somebody else is pulling his strings
[2:34:37.080 --> 2:34:39.080]  The Rockefellers, the Rothschilds
[2:34:39.080 --> 2:34:43.080]  These people own 146 central banks
[2:34:43.080 --> 2:34:45.080]  Including the Fed
[2:34:45.080 --> 2:34:47.080]  Including the German Bundesbank
[2:34:47.080 --> 2:34:50.080]  Including the International Monetary Fund
[2:34:50.080 --> 2:34:51.080]  And the World Bank
[2:34:51.080 --> 2:34:52.080]  But I was gonna...
[2:34:52.080 --> 2:34:54.080]  I have to correct a mistake I made
[2:34:54.080 --> 2:34:56.080]  The actual website
[2:34:56.080 --> 2:34:58.080]  On which you can see all the interviews
[2:34:58.080 --> 2:35:01.080]  We did with people like Dr. Mike Yeadon
[2:35:01.080 --> 2:35:03.080]  A former vice president of Pfizer
[2:35:03.080 --> 2:35:06.080]  Dr...
[2:35:08.080 --> 2:35:10.080]  Oh, rather professor
[2:35:10.080 --> 2:35:11.080]  Luc Montagnier
[2:35:11.080 --> 2:35:14.080]  By the way, Luc Montagnier is a Nobel Prize winner
[2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:15.080]  From France
[2:35:15.080 --> 2:35:16.080]  Yeah, that's correct
[2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:21.080]  It's corona-investigative-committee.com
[2:35:21.080 --> 2:35:23.080]  Luc Montagnier
[2:35:23.080 --> 2:35:24.080]  Get back to him
[2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:27.080]  That's corona-investigative-committee.com
[2:35:27.080 --> 2:35:28.080]  That's the URL to check
[2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:30.080]  Please get back to the discoverer
[2:35:30.080 --> 2:35:33.080]  Of HIV and what he said
[2:35:33.080 --> 2:35:34.080]  Yeah, exactly
[2:35:34.080 --> 2:35:38.080]  And so he discovered HIV
[2:35:38.080 --> 2:35:40.080]  And he, months ago
[2:35:40.080 --> 2:35:41.080]  When we interviewed him
[2:35:41.080 --> 2:35:43.080]  Shortly before he died
[2:35:43.080 --> 2:35:46.080]  He said, well, if you test positive
[2:35:46.080 --> 2:35:48.080]  And you have to be hospitalized
[2:35:48.080 --> 2:35:51.080]  After you got vaccinated
[2:35:51.080 --> 2:35:53.080]  That means you probably have AIDS
[2:35:53.080 --> 2:35:54.080]  Go see your doctor
[2:35:54.080 --> 2:35:55.080]  Go to a hospital
[2:35:55.080 --> 2:35:57.080]  Have them check for AIDS
[2:35:57.080 --> 2:35:59.080]  And it turns out he's right
[2:35:59.080 --> 2:36:01.080]  That's what one of the professors
[2:36:01.080 --> 2:36:04.080]  A biologist from the University of Rootsburg
[2:36:04.080 --> 2:36:07.080]  Told us, professor Ulrika Kemmerer
[2:36:07.080 --> 2:36:10.080]  She said, it looks like these shots
[2:36:10.080 --> 2:36:12.080]  Which are, of course, not vaccines
[2:36:12.080 --> 2:36:14.080]  They're just experimental gene therapies
[2:36:14.080 --> 2:36:16.080]  Or maybe not even therapies
[2:36:16.080 --> 2:36:18.080]  What they're really doing
[2:36:18.080 --> 2:36:20.080]  Is they're shutting off your immune system
[2:36:20.080 --> 2:36:22.080]  And that's why many people call this
[2:36:22.080 --> 2:36:24.080]  What it causes now
[2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:26.080]  Called this VI AIDS
[2:36:26.080 --> 2:36:29.080]  Vaccine-induced autoimmune deficiency syndrome
[2:36:29.080 --> 2:36:31.080]  That's what happens
[2:36:31.080 --> 2:36:33.080]  Plus the blood clotting that you mentioned
[2:36:33.080 --> 2:36:34.080]  That's why not everyone
[2:36:34.080 --> 2:36:36.080]  And how did they think they'd get away with this?
[2:36:36.080 --> 2:36:38.080]  I guess start a war, start a financial collapse
[2:36:38.080 --> 2:36:40.080]  Dearing it to make us forget about what they just did
[2:36:40.080 --> 2:36:43.080]  But yes, vades is now happening
[2:36:43.080 --> 2:36:46.080]  That is exactly the point
[2:36:46.080 --> 2:36:47.080]  They're gonna start
[2:36:47.080 --> 2:36:50.080]  Or they are in the process of starting a war
[2:36:50.080 --> 2:36:52.080]  What we see in Ukraine, again
[2:36:52.080 --> 2:36:54.080]  There's propaganda on both sides
[2:36:54.080 --> 2:36:57.080]  But there is another side to this coin
[2:36:57.080 --> 2:36:59.080]  What we see in Ukraine, as you probably know
[2:36:59.080 --> 2:37:01.080]  And your viewers know, is
[2:37:01.080 --> 2:37:05.080]  The NATO and the Anglo-American financial mafia
[2:37:05.080 --> 2:37:07.080]  Are pushing for a war
[2:37:07.080 --> 2:37:12.080]  They led the Ukraine people to believe
[2:37:12.080 --> 2:37:16.080]  That if they attacked Russia
[2:37:16.080 --> 2:37:20.080]  Take back Crimea by force
[2:37:20.080 --> 2:37:22.080]  They would get support from NATO
[2:37:22.080 --> 2:37:24.080]  Of course they did
[2:37:24.080 --> 2:37:26.080]  But they're trying to push them
[2:37:26.080 --> 2:37:28.080]  They stirred them up, Lindsey Graham
[2:37:28.080 --> 2:37:31.080]  Klaus Schwab, of course
[2:37:31.080 --> 2:37:34.080]  George Soros, all of them said
[2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:36.080]  Go ahead and invade, go ahead and attack
[2:37:36.080 --> 2:37:38.080]  And then when they did it
[2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:40.080]  And attacked the Russian-held areas
[2:37:40.080 --> 2:37:41.080]  That elicited their response
[2:37:41.080 --> 2:37:44.080]  So clearly the globalists wanted to bring Russia into this
[2:37:44.080 --> 2:37:46.080]  As the political distraction
[2:37:46.080 --> 2:37:48.080]  For the economic collapse is now happening
[2:37:48.080 --> 2:37:49.080]  They're blaming Russia
[2:37:49.080 --> 2:37:50.080]  Whether you love Russia or hate them
[2:37:50.080 --> 2:37:52.080]  Russia did not cause the hyperinflation
[2:37:52.080 --> 2:37:54.080]  Of what's currently happening
[2:37:54.080 --> 2:37:56.080]  Yeah, they're making pretty good progress
[2:37:56.080 --> 2:37:58.080]  With their warmongering
[2:37:58.080 --> 2:38:01.080]  They even got the Swiss to
[2:38:01.080 --> 2:38:03.080]  Forget their neutrality
[2:38:03.080 --> 2:38:06.080]  They're not also supplying Ukraine
[2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:08.080]  With all kinds of weapons
[2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:09.080]  Germany is
[2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:11.080]  I think some of the countries
[2:38:11.080 --> 2:38:13.080]  That didn't want to join NATO
[2:38:13.080 --> 2:38:15.080]  Are now about to join NATO
[2:38:15.080 --> 2:38:16.080]  Finland, including
[2:38:16.080 --> 2:38:18.080]  So things are going
[2:38:18.080 --> 2:38:20.080]  Seem to be going according to plan
[2:38:20.080 --> 2:38:22.080]  But part of what we're seeing is
[2:38:22.080 --> 2:38:25.080]  Sheer desperation on the other side
[2:38:25.080 --> 2:38:26.080]  Of course they're making progress
[2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:28.080]  Because they've had so much time
[2:38:28.080 --> 2:38:29.080]  To plan for this
[2:38:29.080 --> 2:38:32.080]  Probably 30 years or make concrete plans
[2:38:32.080 --> 2:38:34.080]  For this for the last 10 years
[2:38:34.080 --> 2:38:35.080]  But they need the collapse to be
[2:38:35.080 --> 2:38:36.080]  Without getting a blame
[2:38:36.080 --> 2:38:38.080]  So they're having success in the collapse
[2:38:38.080 --> 2:38:40.080]  But not in success in covering up
[2:38:40.080 --> 2:38:42.080]  Their running it
[2:38:42.080 --> 2:38:44.080]  Exactly, we're on to them
[2:38:44.080 --> 2:38:46.080]  In fact, the latest thing we found out
[2:38:46.080 --> 2:38:48.080]  About Klaus Schwab
[2:38:48.080 --> 2:38:49.080]  Whom you just mentioned
[2:38:49.080 --> 2:38:52.080]  The head of their most important platform
[2:38:52.080 --> 2:38:54.080]  This is where they meet in Davos
[2:38:54.080 --> 2:38:56.080]  This is where they meet once a year
[2:38:56.080 --> 2:38:59.080]  Klaus Schwab and his World Economic Forum
[2:38:59.080 --> 2:39:02.080]  Everybody thought it's a European invention
[2:39:02.080 --> 2:39:03.080]  They founded it in Europe
[2:39:03.080 --> 2:39:05.080]  Because Klaus Schwab is so smart
[2:39:05.080 --> 2:39:06.080]  No, not so
[2:39:06.080 --> 2:39:08.080]  One of the experts
[2:39:08.080 --> 2:39:10.080]  Who we interviewed last Friday
[2:39:10.080 --> 2:39:12.080]  Is an investigative journalist
[2:39:12.080 --> 2:39:14.080]  By the name of Johnny Vetmore
[2:39:14.080 --> 2:39:17.080]  He's the partner of Whitney Webb
[2:39:17.080 --> 2:39:19.080]  Another investigative journalist
[2:39:19.080 --> 2:39:21.080]  He dug deeply into his family history
[2:39:21.080 --> 2:39:24.080]  Turns out his father, Klaus Schwab's father
[2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:26.080]  Tried to help out the Nazis
[2:39:26.080 --> 2:39:29.080]  Tried to help them build an atomic bomb
[2:39:29.080 --> 2:39:31.080]  And Klaus Schwab tried the very same
[2:39:31.080 --> 2:39:33.080]  In the 1960s
[2:39:33.080 --> 2:39:35.080]  While setting or founding
[2:39:35.080 --> 2:39:36.080]  The World Economic Forum
[2:39:36.080 --> 2:39:38.080]  Oh yeah, he's like doctor
[2:39:38.080 --> 2:39:41.080]  The reason he looks like Dr. Evil is he is
[2:39:41.080 --> 2:39:43.080]  He's literally a supervillain
[2:39:43.080 --> 2:39:44.080]  He is
[2:39:44.080 --> 2:39:46.080]  And he tried to help the
[2:39:46.080 --> 2:39:49.080]  South African apartheid regime
[2:39:49.080 --> 2:39:52.080]  Build up their own nuclear power
[2:39:52.080 --> 2:39:55.080]  Give them the power to make nuclear bombs
[2:39:55.080 --> 2:39:58.080]  This is against international law
[2:39:58.080 --> 2:40:00.080]  This is illegal
[2:40:00.080 --> 2:40:01.080]  This guy is a monster
[2:40:01.080 --> 2:40:03.080]  He's obsessed with power
[2:40:03.080 --> 2:40:04.080]  Yes, absolutely
[2:40:04.080 --> 2:40:06.080]  But it turns out
[2:40:06.080 --> 2:40:08.080]  This is not a European
[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:09.080]  The World Economic Forum
[2:40:09.080 --> 2:40:11.080]  It's not a European creation
[2:40:11.080 --> 2:40:13.080]  Klaus Schwab went to Harvard
[2:40:13.080 --> 2:40:14.080]  In the 1960s
[2:40:14.080 --> 2:40:16.080]  And they had a program there
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:18.080]  Which was financed by the CIA
[2:40:18.080 --> 2:40:20.080]  Run by Henry Kissinger
[2:40:20.080 --> 2:40:22.080]  That's right, he's got the special
[2:40:22.080 --> 2:40:23.080]  I know people involved
[2:40:23.080 --> 2:40:24.080]  They whistleblowed
[2:40:24.080 --> 2:40:25.080]  Dr. Francis Boyle
[2:40:25.080 --> 2:40:27.080]  He got the special one person a year
[2:40:27.080 --> 2:40:30.080]  CIA global government PhD
[2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:32.080]  Yes, that's what he got
[2:40:32.080 --> 2:40:34.080]  So it was basically
[2:40:34.080 --> 2:40:37.080]  A CIA financed
[2:40:37.080 --> 2:40:39.080]  Invention by Henry Kissinger
[2:40:39.080 --> 2:40:42.080]  Another thing that could be important
[2:40:42.080 --> 2:40:44.080]  I don't know if you've spoken to this guy
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:45.080]  Todd Callender
[2:40:45.080 --> 2:40:47.080]  He's a U.S. attorney
[2:40:47.080 --> 2:40:49.080]  Specializes in insurance law
[2:40:49.080 --> 2:40:51.080]  And he represents thousands and thousands
[2:40:51.080 --> 2:40:54.080]  Of members of the military
[2:40:54.080 --> 2:40:58.080]  And he tells us that in 2021
[2:40:58.080 --> 2:41:01.080]  Only during the first 10 months of 2021
[2:41:01.080 --> 2:41:05.080]  The military saw a 1,100% increase
[2:41:05.080 --> 2:41:08.080]  In deaths after vaccination
[2:41:08.080 --> 2:41:10.080]  Now, this is not old people
[2:41:10.080 --> 2:41:12.080]  Who had prior medical conditions
[2:41:12.080 --> 2:41:15.080]  This is young, healthy, fit people
[2:41:15.080 --> 2:41:18.080]  Between the ages of 18 and 30 maybe
[2:41:18.080 --> 2:41:19.080]  Who didn't wake up
[2:41:19.080 --> 2:41:21.080]  Who just stayed in bed
[2:41:21.080 --> 2:41:23.080]  And never woke up dead
[2:41:23.080 --> 2:41:25.080]  For 2022, he says
[2:41:25.080 --> 2:41:29.080]  We expect an increase in all-cause mortality
[2:41:29.080 --> 2:41:32.080]  In the military of 5,000%
[2:41:32.080 --> 2:41:36.080]  Now, if this is not genocide, what is?
[2:41:36.080 --> 2:41:38.080]  You're able to really break this down
[2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:39.080]  Dr. Fulman
[2:41:39.080 --> 2:41:40.080]  What's the in-game?
[2:41:40.080 --> 2:41:41.080]  We know it's depopulation
[2:41:41.080 --> 2:41:43.080]  But why are they doing it now?
[2:41:43.080 --> 2:41:45.080]  It's so risky in my view
[2:41:45.080 --> 2:41:46.080]  Even for the establishment
[2:41:46.080 --> 2:41:48.080]  This is crazy
[2:41:48.080 --> 2:41:50.080]  Well, it may very well be that
[2:41:50.080 --> 2:41:53.080]  They were pushed into an early start
[2:41:53.080 --> 2:41:55.080]  You know, 11 or 12 years ago
[2:41:55.080 --> 2:41:58.080]  When we had the housing crisis
[2:41:58.080 --> 2:41:59.080]  The Lehman crisis
[2:41:59.080 --> 2:42:01.080]  We should have been much more careful
[2:42:01.080 --> 2:42:03.080]  I, as a former banker
[2:42:03.080 --> 2:42:07.080]  I used to work for one of the most criminal organizations
[2:42:07.080 --> 2:42:09.080]  Within the banking industry
[2:42:09.080 --> 2:42:11.080]  The banking mafia, rather, Deutsche Bank
[2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:13.080]  I should have seen what's going on
[2:42:13.080 --> 2:42:15.080]  I should have seen this as blatant fraud
[2:42:15.080 --> 2:42:17.080]  I have a really good friend who
[2:42:17.080 --> 2:42:20.080]  You know, I spent 3 weeks in India
[2:42:20.080 --> 2:42:21.080]  Recharging my batteries
[2:42:21.080 --> 2:42:23.080]  I met a really good friend there
[2:42:23.080 --> 2:42:25.080]  Who also used to work for Deutsche Bank
[2:42:25.080 --> 2:42:26.080]  A former investment banker
[2:42:26.080 --> 2:42:28.080]  He's afraid that we're going to have
[2:42:28.080 --> 2:42:29.080]  World War III in the fall
[2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:30.080]  And it's going to play out
[2:42:30.080 --> 2:42:32.080]  The battlefield will be Europe
[2:42:32.080 --> 2:42:34.080]  So he is staying in India
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:35.080]  Stay there, Dr. Reimer Fulman
[2:42:35.080 --> 2:42:36.080]  Exactly
[2:42:36.080 --> 2:42:37.080]  And I think what you're getting in
[2:42:37.080 --> 2:42:38.080]  I'm not trying to steal your thunder
[2:42:38.080 --> 2:42:40.080]  Just to show we're not making this up
[2:42:40.080 --> 2:42:41.080]  There's too many old people
[2:42:41.080 --> 2:42:42.080]  They've got a bubble
[2:42:42.080 --> 2:42:43.080]  They just want to kill a bunch of people
[2:42:43.080 --> 2:42:45.080]  Instead of them going to jail
[2:42:45.080 --> 2:42:46.080]  We'll be right back
[2:42:46.080 --> 2:42:47.080]  We'll talk about why they're doing this
[2:42:47.080 --> 2:42:48.080]  Why Black Rock
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:49.080]  And those who do this
[2:42:49.080 --> 2:42:50.080]  Now we need to stop this together
[2:42:50.080 --> 2:42:51.080]  We're going to stop it

[2:47:51.080 --> 2:47:53.080]  But seeing what you're doing now
[2:47:53.080 --> 2:47:55.080]  Planning the crises
[2:47:55.080 --> 2:47:57.080]  They're engineering their
[2:47:57.080 --> 2:47:59.080]  Economic system coming to an end
[2:47:59.080 --> 2:48:01.080]  The fact that they're all going to go to jail
[2:48:01.080 --> 2:48:03.080]  Because of derivatives
[2:48:03.080 --> 2:48:05.080]  If they don't quote kill the old people
[2:48:05.080 --> 2:48:07.080]  So you've got all the boomers
[2:48:07.080 --> 2:48:09.080]  So many of them signed on to this leftist agenda
[2:48:09.080 --> 2:48:11.080]  And then this whole
[2:48:11.080 --> 2:48:13.080]  New deal, this whole global carbon tax
[2:48:13.080 --> 2:48:15.080]  This whole build back better
[2:48:15.080 --> 2:48:17.080]  But at the heart of it, the globalists admit
[2:48:17.080 --> 2:48:19.080]  It's about not giving 65
[2:48:19.080 --> 2:48:21.080]  And up healthcare or their pensions
[2:48:21.080 --> 2:48:23.080]  And I guess giving them vaccines they know statistically
[2:48:23.080 --> 2:48:25.080]  Aren't vaccines are going to kill them
[2:48:25.080 --> 2:48:27.080]  So this is
[2:48:27.080 --> 2:48:29.080]  Instead of Barty Manov going to jail
[2:48:29.080 --> 2:48:31.080]  These bankers end up taking over the world
[2:48:31.080 --> 2:48:33.080]  It seems like pretty simple to beat
[2:48:33.080 --> 2:48:35.080]  If we admit we're being attacked by something this evil
[2:48:35.080 --> 2:48:37.080]  The problem is there's that
[2:48:37.080 --> 2:48:39.080]  Learned helplessness or that
[2:48:39.080 --> 2:48:41.080]  Mass Stockholm syndrome where people
[2:48:41.080 --> 2:48:43.080]  Just don't want to admit what's really happening
[2:48:43.080 --> 2:48:45.080]  So it's just too frightening but
[2:48:45.080 --> 2:48:47.080]  Not admitting it lets it happen
[2:48:47.080 --> 2:48:49.080]  Which is actually frightening
[2:48:49.080 --> 2:48:51.080]  That's exactly true
[2:48:51.080 --> 2:48:53.080]  We do have to see the full picture
[2:48:53.080 --> 2:48:55.080]  We have to see what's really going on
[2:48:55.080 --> 2:48:57.080]  No matter how frightening it is
[2:48:57.080 --> 2:48:59.080]  Because if we don't
[2:48:59.080 --> 2:49:01.080]  We're not going to do the right thing
[2:49:01.080 --> 2:49:03.080]  And it's right
[2:49:03.080 --> 2:49:05.080]  This is basically a financial catastrophe
[2:49:05.080 --> 2:49:07.080]  That we're facing
[2:49:07.080 --> 2:49:09.080]  Our currencies are probably going to
[2:49:09.080 --> 2:49:11.080]  Be completely devalued
[2:49:11.080 --> 2:49:13.080]  Very soon the dollar
[2:49:13.080 --> 2:49:15.080]  Has reached the end of the line
[2:49:15.080 --> 2:49:17.080]  And it turns out
[2:49:17.080 --> 2:49:19.080]  That in maybe the
[2:49:19.080 --> 2:49:21.080]  Their own
[2:49:21.080 --> 2:49:23.080]  Their own wrongdoing
[2:49:23.080 --> 2:49:25.080]  Pushed them into an early start
[2:49:25.080 --> 2:49:27.080]  Because you know
[2:49:27.080 --> 2:49:29.080]  As I said earlier
[2:49:29.080 --> 2:49:31.080]  We should have known that
[2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:33.080]  The financial industry is really a financial mafia
[2:49:33.080 --> 2:49:35.080]  When we saw what happened
[2:49:35.080 --> 2:49:37.080]  After the financial crisis
[2:49:37.080 --> 2:49:39.080]  Of the Lehman
[2:49:39.080 --> 2:49:41.080]  The housing crisis which turned into a world
[2:49:41.080 --> 2:49:43.080]  Economic crisis because nothing happened
[2:49:43.080 --> 2:49:45.080]  Despite the fact that the politicians
[2:49:45.080 --> 2:49:47.080]  Said we're going to stop this once
[2:49:47.080 --> 2:49:49.080]  And for all we're going to hold everyone responsible
[2:49:49.080 --> 2:49:51.080]  Everyone accountable
[2:49:51.080 --> 2:49:53.080]  Who is accountable nothing happened
[2:49:53.080 --> 2:49:55.080]  Except that they printed money
[2:49:55.080 --> 2:49:57.080]  They looted and plundered our public coffers
[2:49:57.080 --> 2:49:59.080]  Over decades probably much longer
[2:49:59.080 --> 2:50:01.080]  Than that but we can see this
[2:50:01.080 --> 2:50:03.080]  Precisely over decades
[2:50:03.080 --> 2:50:05.080]  And then in September
[2:50:05.080 --> 2:50:07.080]  Of 2019
[2:50:07.080 --> 2:50:09.080]  When the central bankers
[2:50:09.080 --> 2:50:11.080]  Met in Jackson Hole, Wyoming
[2:50:11.080 --> 2:50:13.080]  Which they do once a year
[2:50:13.080 --> 2:50:15.080]  Backrock seems to
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:17.080]  Have panicked
[2:50:17.080 --> 2:50:19.080]  Because we are in possession
[2:50:19.080 --> 2:50:21.080]  Of a summary that they did
[2:50:21.080 --> 2:50:23.080]  For this meeting and they basically
[2:50:23.080 --> 2:50:25.080]  Said, not using these
[2:50:25.080 --> 2:50:27.080]  The very same words that I'm using
[2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:29.080]  Man they're on to us
[2:50:29.080 --> 2:50:31.080]  They know what's going on
[2:50:31.080 --> 2:50:33.080]  We have to do something drastic
[2:50:33.080 --> 2:50:35.080]  In order to distract their attention
[2:50:35.080 --> 2:50:37.080]  And that is why I think
[2:50:37.080 --> 2:50:39.080]  They had an early start
[2:50:39.080 --> 2:50:41.080]  They pushed Drustin to invent
[2:50:41.080 --> 2:50:43.080]  These two fraudulent
[2:50:43.080 --> 2:50:45.080]  Assertions
[2:50:45.080 --> 2:50:47.080]  There are asymptomatic infections
[2:50:47.080 --> 2:50:49.080]  Of course they're not, there's no such thing
[2:50:49.080 --> 2:50:51.080]  Asymptomatically
[2:50:51.080 --> 2:50:53.080]  Infected people are healthy people
[2:50:53.080 --> 2:50:55.080]  And two, I
[2:50:55.080 --> 2:50:57.080]  Drustin have invented
[2:50:57.080 --> 2:50:59.080]  A PC artist that can tell you
[2:50:59.080 --> 2:51:01.080]  Who really is infected
[2:51:01.080 --> 2:51:03.080]  When in fact a PC artist
[2:51:03.080 --> 2:51:05.080]  Can do no such thing and this guy
[2:51:05.080 --> 2:51:07.080]  Knew it, he's lying and we can show it
[2:51:07.080 --> 2:51:09.080]  In a court of law, unfortunately
[2:51:09.080 --> 2:51:11.080]  Health organization published this
[2:51:11.080 --> 2:51:13.080]  And recommended this PCR testing
[2:51:13.080 --> 2:51:15.080]  So that is the basis
[2:51:15.080 --> 2:51:17.080]  That's the foundation for everything
[2:51:17.080 --> 2:51:19.080]  And that's why we and all of my lawsuits
[2:51:19.080 --> 2:51:21.080]  And all of my colleagues lawsuits
[2:51:21.080 --> 2:51:23.080]  Have decided to attack at this foundation
[2:51:23.080 --> 2:51:25.080]  Because if there's no cases
[2:51:25.080 --> 2:51:27.080]  Because the PCR test cannot tell you
[2:51:27.080 --> 2:51:29.080]  Anything about infections
[2:51:29.080 --> 2:51:31.080]  Then there's no basis, no factual
[2:51:31.080 --> 2:51:33.080]  And no legal basis
[2:51:33.080 --> 2:51:35.080]  For any of the measures let alone
[2:51:35.080 --> 2:51:37.080]  For the so-called vaccinations
[2:51:37.080 --> 2:51:39.080]  So it was BlackRock
[2:51:39.080 --> 2:51:41.080]  That led us to believe
[2:51:41.080 --> 2:51:43.080]  And I think this is a
[2:51:43.080 --> 2:51:45.080]  Correct assumption that they were
[2:51:45.080 --> 2:51:47.080]  Pushed into an early start and that
[2:51:47.080 --> 2:51:49.080]  Gives us an advantage over them
[2:51:49.080 --> 2:51:51.080]  Because they're in a hurry
[2:51:51.080 --> 2:51:53.080]  They are the ones who are really
[2:51:53.080 --> 2:51:55.080]  Panicking because they know
[2:51:55.080 --> 2:51:57.080]  If they don't succeed
[2:51:57.080 --> 2:51:59.080]  In distracting us from
[2:51:59.080 --> 2:52:01.080]  What they have done
[2:52:01.080 --> 2:52:03.080]  If they don't succeed in
[2:52:03.080 --> 2:52:05.080]  Keeping us from waking up
[2:52:05.080 --> 2:52:07.080]  We're going to hold them responsible
[2:52:07.080 --> 2:52:09.080]  This time we're not going to let
[2:52:09.080 --> 2:52:11.080]  The politicians do it but we're
[2:52:11.080 --> 2:52:13.080]  Going to do it ourselves because
[2:52:13.080 --> 2:52:15.080]  We have to do it ourselves
[2:52:15.080 --> 2:52:17.080]  There is no cavalry that's going to come to our aid
[2:52:17.080 --> 2:52:19.080]  There's no foreign power
[2:52:19.080 --> 2:52:21.080]  That's going to come to our aid
[2:52:21.080 --> 2:52:23.080]  No allies that are going to free Germany
[2:52:23.080 --> 2:52:25.080]  Or any other country, we
[2:52:25.080 --> 2:52:27.080]  The people have to rise up
[2:52:27.080 --> 2:52:29.080]  And do it because if we don't
[2:52:29.080 --> 2:52:31.080]  Things are going to get a lot worse
[2:52:31.080 --> 2:52:33.080]  And this is going to be the end of humanity
[2:52:33.080 --> 2:52:35.080]  And that's what this is about
[2:52:35.080 --> 2:52:37.080]  These people are
[2:52:37.080 --> 2:52:39.080]  Sociopaths and psychopaths
[2:52:39.080 --> 2:52:41.080]  And they do in fact
[2:52:41.080 --> 2:52:43.080]  Want to gain control over
[2:52:43.080 --> 2:52:45.080]  All of us by
[2:52:45.080 --> 2:52:47.080]  Creating this one world government
[2:52:47.080 --> 2:52:49.080]  And one world digital currency
[2:52:49.080 --> 2:52:51.080]  If we don't do anything
[2:52:51.080 --> 2:52:53.080]  We can see what's going to happen in
[2:52:53.080 --> 2:52:55.080]  Australia, one of the people who
[2:52:55.080 --> 2:52:57.080]  We talked to last Friday
[2:52:57.080 --> 2:52:59.080]  A German who's been living there for
[2:52:59.080 --> 2:53:01.080]  25 years told us
[2:53:01.080 --> 2:53:03.080]  That in the meantime
[2:53:03.080 --> 2:53:05.080]  While they're not
[2:53:05.080 --> 2:53:07.080]  Having, they seemingly have no
[2:53:07.080 --> 2:53:09.080]  Restrictions, this is just
[2:53:09.080 --> 2:53:11.080]  The calm before the storm as you said
[2:53:11.080 --> 2:53:13.080]  And that's what he said too
[2:53:13.080 --> 2:53:15.080]  But this leads people in Australia
[2:53:15.080 --> 2:53:17.080]  To not do anything, there are no
[2:53:17.080 --> 2:53:19.080]  Demonstrations anymore because
[2:53:19.080 --> 2:53:21.080]  There are no restrictions, however
[2:53:21.080 --> 2:53:23.080]  They have all these quarantine centers
[2:53:23.080 --> 2:53:25.080]  Which he says look
[2:53:25.080 --> 2:53:27.080]  Like concentration camps
[2:53:27.080 --> 2:53:29.080]  They were holding Australian
[2:53:29.080 --> 2:53:31.080]  Senators because they can play
[2:53:31.080 --> 2:53:33.080]  And they go, it's not 14 days now
[2:53:33.080 --> 2:53:35.080]  It's a month, and they said
[2:53:35.080 --> 2:53:37.080]  Oh, if you speak out, we catch you
[2:53:37.080 --> 2:53:39.080]  On your cell phone criticizing, you get
[2:53:39.080 --> 2:53:41.080]  More weeks, so they already admit
[2:53:41.080 --> 2:53:43.080]  There are reeducation camps
[2:53:43.080 --> 2:53:45.080]  Exactly, there are reeducation camps
[2:53:45.080 --> 2:53:47.080]  And what we are afraid
[2:53:47.080 --> 2:53:49.080]  Is going to happen, that come fall
[2:53:49.080 --> 2:53:51.080]  They're going to really use this
[2:53:51.080 --> 2:53:53.080]  Not to quarantine
[2:53:53.080 --> 2:53:55.080]  People who test positive
[2:53:55.080 --> 2:53:57.080]  Or who are not vaccinated
[2:53:57.080 --> 2:53:59.080]  Well, those two, but people who are
[2:53:59.080 --> 2:54:01.080]  In the resistance, that's what he's afraid of
[2:54:01.080 --> 2:54:03.080]  And on top of this, he says
[2:54:03.080 --> 2:54:05.080]  He took it, he and some other
[2:54:05.080 --> 2:54:07.080]  Investigative journalists took a deep dive
[2:54:07.080 --> 2:54:09.080]  Into the government, he says it's like a pyramid
[2:54:09.080 --> 2:54:11.080]  What he used to think is that only
[2:54:11.080 --> 2:54:13.080]  At the top, did they infiltrate
[2:54:13.080 --> 2:54:15.080]  Their people, but no, not so
[2:54:15.080 --> 2:54:17.080]  That's what I found out, I used to think
[2:54:17.080 --> 2:54:19.080]  Exactly, 20 years ago it was the top
[2:54:19.080 --> 2:54:21.080]  Now they've infiltrated right to the bottom
[2:54:21.080 --> 2:54:23.080]  Exactly, that's how
[2:54:23.080 --> 2:54:25.080]  They work, and
[2:54:25.080 --> 2:54:27.080]  So what do you think we should do
[2:54:27.080 --> 2:54:29.080]  When faced with something that monstrous
[2:54:29.080 --> 2:54:31.080]  Well
[2:54:31.080 --> 2:54:33.080]  Basically two things, don't panic
[2:54:33.080 --> 2:54:35.080]  Because that's what they want us to do
[2:54:35.080 --> 2:54:37.080]  That's what this is all about
[2:54:37.080 --> 2:54:39.080]  Disorient us
[2:54:39.080 --> 2:54:41.080]  Put us into panic mode, so don't panic
[2:54:41.080 --> 2:54:43.080]  And simply
[2:54:43.080 --> 2:54:45.080]  The best thing to do, this is what the psychologist told us
[2:54:45.080 --> 2:54:47.080]  Is turn off
[2:54:47.080 --> 2:54:49.080]  The mainstream media, don't listen
[2:54:49.080 --> 2:54:51.080]  To our politicians because they're not our politicians
[2:54:51.080 --> 2:54:53.080]  And get
[2:54:53.080 --> 2:54:55.080]  The truth out
[2:54:55.080 --> 2:54:57.080]  Look at
[2:54:57.080 --> 2:54:59.080]  For example, look at what you're doing
[2:54:59.080 --> 2:55:01.080]  Look at what
[2:55:01.080 --> 2:55:03.080]  Do the real and then magnify it
[2:55:03.080 --> 2:55:05.080]  And don't feel like a victim going the offense
[2:55:05.080 --> 2:55:07.080]  Exactly
[2:55:07.080 --> 2:55:09.080]  Because we're not the victims
[2:55:09.080 --> 2:55:11.080]  We're the ones who can turn this thing around
[2:55:11.080 --> 2:55:13.080]  Because us, the 20%
[2:55:13.080 --> 2:55:15.080]  Who are in the resistance are not the ones
[2:55:15.080 --> 2:55:17.080]  Who simply follow orders
[2:55:17.080 --> 2:55:19.080]  We're the ones who are creative
[2:55:19.080 --> 2:55:21.080]  We ask questions and we're creative
[2:55:21.080 --> 2:55:23.080]  We are the ones, probably the only ones
[2:55:23.080 --> 2:55:25.080]  Our 20%, maybe it's a little more
[2:55:25.080 --> 2:55:27.080]  In the not so
[2:55:27.080 --> 2:55:29.080]  As they say, not so developed countries
[2:55:29.080 --> 2:55:31.080]  But as you say
[2:55:31.080 --> 2:55:33.080]  I don't interrupt you, but it's well known
[2:55:33.080 --> 2:55:35.080]  5% in a
[2:55:35.080 --> 2:55:37.080]  Free economy, maybe 20 in a third world country
[2:55:37.080 --> 2:55:39.080]  But if you've got 5% in a resistance movement
[2:55:39.080 --> 2:55:41.080]  Whether it's bad or good, it's going to win
[2:55:41.080 --> 2:55:43.080]  If you don't give up, I agree with you
[2:55:43.080 --> 2:55:45.080]  I think we're 20% and growing each
[2:55:45.080 --> 2:55:47.080]  Week and month, why the system is so panicked
[2:55:47.080 --> 2:55:49.080]  Because people want freedom
[2:55:49.080 --> 2:55:51.080]  And we are promoting it
[2:55:51.080 --> 2:55:53.080]  So we're very close
[2:55:53.080 --> 2:55:55.080]  We shouldn't fight the system
[2:55:55.080 --> 2:55:57.080]  It's collapsing anyhow
[2:55:57.080 --> 2:55:59.080]  We should simply set up
[2:55:59.080 --> 2:56:01.080]  A parallel system
[2:56:01.080 --> 2:56:03.080]  Of justice
[2:56:03.080 --> 2:56:05.080]  Of economics
[2:56:05.080 --> 2:56:07.080]  Of health care and of education
[2:56:07.080 --> 2:56:09.080]  We can do it
[2:56:09.080 --> 2:56:11.080]  I totally agree, fighting it only gives them power
[2:56:11.080 --> 2:56:13.080]  It's going down, we want to be away from it
[2:56:15.080 --> 2:56:17.080]  And it's only a matter of time
[2:56:17.080 --> 2:56:19.080]  That this whole thing is collapsing
[2:56:19.080 --> 2:56:21.080]  Right now
[2:56:21.080 --> 2:56:23.080]  We shouldn't just sit there and not do anything
[2:56:23.080 --> 2:56:25.080]  But as you said, we should
[2:56:25.080 --> 2:56:27.080]  Continue to get out the truth
[2:56:27.080 --> 2:56:29.080]  Disseminate this information so that
[2:56:29.080 --> 2:56:31.080]  As many people as possible understand
[2:56:31.080 --> 2:56:33.080]  What's going on, including those 40%
[2:56:33.080 --> 2:56:35.080]  Who are still sitting on the fence
[2:56:35.080 --> 2:56:37.080]  Many of them are beginning to ask
[2:56:37.080 --> 2:56:39.080]  Questions, even those who got vaccinated
[2:56:39.080 --> 2:56:41.080]  Because they don't think
[2:56:41.080 --> 2:56:43.080]  It makes any sense
[2:56:43.080 --> 2:56:45.080]  That they need another and another and another shot
[2:56:45.080 --> 2:56:47.080]  And in the meantime
[2:56:47.080 --> 2:56:49.080]  Moderna got an EUA
[2:56:49.080 --> 2:56:51.080]  Approval for their
[2:56:51.080 --> 2:56:53.080]  AIDS vaccine
[2:56:53.080 --> 2:56:55.080]  What is this all about?
[2:56:55.080 --> 2:56:57.080]  I know you've got to go
[2:56:57.080 --> 2:56:59.080]  Two minute break, five minutes
[2:56:59.080 --> 2:57:01.080]  Dr. Fulmick, we've got to get into the HIV virus
[2:57:01.080 --> 2:57:03.080]  HIV vaccine
[2:57:03.080 --> 2:57:05.080]  This whole thing with Fauci obsessed
[2:57:05.080 --> 2:57:07.080]  With HIV
[2:57:07.080 --> 2:57:09.080]  And now they've released a virus
[2:57:09.080 --> 2:57:11.080]  That has part of HIV in it
[2:57:11.080 --> 2:57:13.080]  And now it's in the news
[2:57:13.080 --> 2:57:15.080]  What is the binary function?
[2:57:15.080 --> 2:57:17.080]  As we get, they want us to have this
[2:57:17.080 --> 2:57:19.080]  It's bad enough, but what do they add?
[2:57:19.080 --> 2:57:21.080]  Your best thinking on that
[2:57:21.080 --> 2:57:23.080]  We come back in two minutes
[2:57:23.080 --> 2:57:25.080]  Folks, you've got to visit the website
[2:57:25.080 --> 2:57:27.080]  Corona-investigative-committee.com
[2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:29.080]  The enemy
[2:57:29.080 --> 2:57:31.080]  Is working around the clock to make sure
[2:57:31.080 --> 2:57:33.080]  This information doesn't get out
[2:57:33.080 --> 2:57:35.080]  I'm going to finish some final news
[2:57:35.080 --> 2:57:37.080]  And Kate Daly is going to take over
[2:57:37.080 --> 2:57:39.080]  In the fourth hour
[2:57:39.080 --> 2:57:41.080]  And meanwhile, they have US courts
[2:57:41.080 --> 2:57:43.080]  I just got that news
[2:57:43.080 --> 2:58:11.080]  We are only offering three coins in the series
[2:58:11.080 --> 2:58:13.080]  So, go for yourself

[2:58:33.080 --> 2:58:35.080]  Thanks to your support
[2:58:35.080 --> 2:58:37.080]  Of this project
[2:58:37.080 --> 2:58:39.080]  Get a historic memento
[2:58:39.080 --> 2:58:41.080]  That helps keep info wars on the air
[2:58:41.080 --> 2:58:43.080]  And also gives you
[2:58:43.080 --> 2:58:45.080]  A real piece of history
[2:58:45.080 --> 2:58:47.080]  At 1776coin.com
[2:58:47.080 --> 2:58:49.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help
[2:58:49.080 --> 2:58:51.080]  I need your help keeping info wars
[2:58:51.080 --> 2:58:53.080]  On the air and strong
[2:58:53.080 --> 2:58:55.080]  I need your help making sure
[2:58:55.080 --> 2:58:57.080]  That our mission continues on
[2:58:57.080 --> 2:58:59.080]  I was born for this
[2:58:59.080 --> 2:59:01.080]  You were born for this
[2:59:01.080 --> 2:59:03.080]  And people are really waking up right now
[2:59:03.080 --> 2:59:05.080]  But we had to build our own infrastructure
[2:59:05.080 --> 2:59:07.080]  Because of the censorship
[2:59:07.080 --> 2:59:09.080]  That cost tens of millions of dollars
[2:59:09.080 --> 2:59:11.080]  And now, with Band-Aid video
[2:59:11.080 --> 2:59:13.080]  Getting close to 10 million views a day
[2:59:13.080 --> 2:59:15.080]  We're a platform for thousands
[2:59:15.080 --> 2:59:17.080]  Of independent journalists and groups
[2:59:17.080 --> 2:59:19.080]  To be able to post their content
[2:59:19.080 --> 2:59:21.080]  Free of charge
[2:59:21.080 --> 2:59:23.080]  And because it's become so successful
[2:59:23.080 --> 2:59:25.080]  It's a catch-22
[2:59:25.080 --> 2:59:27.080]  Info wars and Band-Aid video
[2:59:27.080 --> 2:59:29.080]  Have become a mothership
[2:59:29.080 --> 2:59:31.080]  Promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide
[2:59:31.080 --> 2:59:33.080]  But the expenses
[2:59:33.080 --> 2:59:35.080]  In bandwidth alone are millions of dollars
[2:59:35.080 --> 2:59:37.080]  A quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[2:59:37.080 --> 2:59:39.080]  Of thousands of dollars a month
[2:59:39.080 --> 2:59:41.080]  So, the biggest sale in info wars history
[2:59:41.080 --> 2:59:43.080]  Is going right now, the mega emergency blowout sale
[2:59:43.080 --> 2:59:45.080]  Up to 75% off
[2:59:45.080 --> 2:59:47.080]  Getting credible products and keep info wars
[2:59:47.080 --> 3:00:07.080]  As long as ever
[3:00:07.080 --> 3:00:09.080]  Humanity is at the crossroads
[3:00:09.080 --> 3:00:11.080]  And I remember
[3:00:11.080 --> 3:00:13.080]  Dr. Edon
[3:00:13.080 --> 3:00:15.080]  And Dr. Zelinko and others
[3:00:15.080 --> 3:00:17.080]  Two years ago, warning
[3:00:17.080 --> 3:00:19.080]  Hey, this has the HIV insertion
[3:00:19.080 --> 3:00:21.080]  We know Indian University scanned it
[3:00:21.080 --> 3:00:23.080]  And found that back in February of 2020
[3:00:23.080 --> 3:00:25.080]  And now here we are
[3:00:25.080 --> 3:00:27.080]  With these huge autoimmune responses
[3:00:27.080 --> 3:00:29.080]  Mass deaths in Israel
[3:00:29.080 --> 3:00:31.080]  The more they take the shots
[3:00:31.080 --> 3:00:33.080]  And they just pushing it and pushing so
[3:00:33.080 --> 3:00:35.080]  We've got Dr. Reiner Fulmick
[3:00:35.080 --> 3:00:37.080]  Who is a well-known former banker
[3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:39.080]  And also lawyer who's been heading up
[3:00:39.080 --> 3:00:41.080]  Really the tip of the spear, exposing all this
[3:00:41.080 --> 3:00:43.080]  What, because I'm trying to figure it out
[3:00:43.080 --> 3:00:45.080]  Is there something there? There's a spike protein
[3:00:45.080 --> 3:00:47.080]  That's patented by Bill Gates
[3:00:47.080 --> 3:00:49.080]  And others that take HIV with Moderna
[3:00:49.080 --> 3:00:51.080]  But what's this AIDS connection?
[3:00:53.080 --> 3:00:55.080]  I don't know
[3:00:55.080 --> 3:00:57.080]  If really
[3:00:57.080 --> 3:00:59.080]  The HIV virus
[3:00:59.080 --> 3:01:01.080]  Was inserted
[3:01:01.080 --> 3:01:03.080]  In this virus
[3:01:03.080 --> 3:01:05.080]  We know that there have been
[3:01:05.080 --> 3:01:07.080]  All kinds of experiments, gain of function experiments
[3:01:07.080 --> 3:01:09.080]  Which
[3:01:09.080 --> 3:01:11.080]  Seem to have
[3:01:11.080 --> 3:01:13.080]  What they wanted to do is make the virus
[3:01:13.080 --> 3:01:15.080]  More dangerous, make it
[3:01:15.080 --> 3:01:17.080]  Jump from animals to humans
[3:01:17.080 --> 3:01:19.080]  Make it more dangerous, basically
[3:01:19.080 --> 3:01:21.080]  What I do know after having
[3:01:21.080 --> 3:01:23.080]  Listened and interviewed to so many
[3:01:23.080 --> 3:01:25.080]  Experts is
[3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:27.080]  That this is a vaccine
[3:01:27.080 --> 3:01:29.080]  Induced autoimmune
[3:01:31.080 --> 3:01:33.080]  Deficiency syndrome
[3:01:33.080 --> 3:01:35.080]  We don't know
[3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:37.080]  How this is happening
[3:01:37.080 --> 3:01:39.080]  We've had a number of pathology conferences
[3:01:39.080 --> 3:01:41.080]  Which
[3:01:41.080 --> 3:01:43.080]  And there are now
[3:01:43.080 --> 3:01:45.080]  50 pathologists cooperating here
[3:01:45.080 --> 3:01:47.080]  They looked, they performed post mortems
[3:01:47.080 --> 3:01:49.080]  On dozens of people
[3:01:49.080 --> 3:01:51.080]  And they came to the conclusion
[3:01:51.080 --> 3:01:53.080]  That
[3:01:53.080 --> 3:01:55.080]  About 70% of those
[3:01:55.080 --> 3:01:57.080]  Who died after getting the shots
[3:01:57.080 --> 3:01:59.080]  Definitely died
[3:01:59.080 --> 3:02:01.080]  Because of the shots
[3:02:01.080 --> 3:02:03.080]  So there is causation there
[3:02:03.080 --> 3:02:05.080]  In another 20% there's a high probability
[3:02:05.080 --> 3:02:07.080]  That that is the case
[3:02:07.080 --> 3:02:09.080]  In which they came to the conclusion
[3:02:09.080 --> 3:02:11.080]  It wasn't caused by the vaccines
[3:02:11.080 --> 3:02:13.080]  However
[3:02:13.080 --> 3:02:15.080]  These vaccines as you pointed out
[3:02:15.080 --> 3:02:17.080]  Rightly are not vaccines
[3:02:17.080 --> 3:02:19.080]  They're experimental
[3:02:19.080 --> 3:02:21.080]  Not even gene therapies as one of the
[3:02:21.080 --> 3:02:23.080]  Professors from France told us
[3:02:23.080 --> 3:02:25.080]  But gene experiments
[3:02:25.080 --> 3:02:27.080]  Because
[3:02:27.080 --> 3:02:29.080]  You can use
[3:02:29.080 --> 3:02:31.080]  mRNA technique for gene
[3:02:31.080 --> 3:02:33.080]  Therapy
[3:02:33.080 --> 3:02:35.080]  That's a recognized
[3:02:35.080 --> 3:02:37.080]  Way of using mRNA techniques
[3:02:37.080 --> 3:02:39.080]  But
[3:02:39.080 --> 3:02:41.080]  Through this you replace
[3:02:41.080 --> 3:02:43.080]  A defective gene with another one
[3:02:43.080 --> 3:02:45.080]  That is not what's happening here
[3:02:45.080 --> 3:02:47.080]  They're experimenting
[3:02:47.080 --> 3:02:49.080]  And we don't know what they're using
[3:02:49.080 --> 3:02:51.080]  Because even though some of our experts
[3:02:51.080 --> 3:02:53.080]  Have looked into the vials
[3:02:53.080 --> 3:02:55.080]  To see what's in there
[3:02:55.080 --> 3:02:57.080]  We still don't know what is really in there
[3:02:57.080 --> 3:02:59.080]  Because you know why
[3:02:59.080 --> 3:03:01.080]  Because no one, none of the authorities
[3:03:01.080 --> 3:03:03.080]  None of the public authorities
[3:03:03.080 --> 3:03:05.080]  Which have been taken over
[3:03:05.080 --> 3:03:07.080]  By all these private institutions
[3:03:07.080 --> 3:03:09.080]  You probably know that the FDA
[3:03:09.080 --> 3:03:11.080]  Is funded at least to
[3:03:11.080 --> 3:03:13.080]  50 or 60%
[3:03:13.080 --> 3:03:15.080]  By the pharmaceutical industry
[3:03:15.080 --> 3:03:17.080]  So none of them really check this
[3:03:17.080 --> 3:03:19.080]  They're supposed to do this
[3:03:19.080 --> 3:03:21.080]  Because they're working in our
[3:03:21.080 --> 3:03:23.080]  Public's best interest
[3:03:23.080 --> 3:03:25.080]  But they're not, they simply trust
[3:03:25.080 --> 3:03:27.080]  The makers of these vaccines
[3:03:27.080 --> 3:03:29.080]  So that's what this is all about
[3:03:29.080 --> 3:03:31.080]  We got a bunch of mad scientists
[3:03:31.080 --> 3:03:33.080]  And crazy
[3:03:33.080 --> 3:03:35.080]  Yes, they just do whatever
[3:03:35.080 --> 3:03:37.080]  They want to do because this is a free
[3:03:37.080 --> 3:03:39.080]  For all, no one is checking
[3:03:39.080 --> 3:03:41.080]  On anything in no country
[3:03:41.080 --> 3:03:43.080]  With the exception maybe of some
[3:03:43.080 --> 3:03:45.080]  Of the African countries and maybe
[3:03:45.080 --> 3:03:47.080]  India as well
[3:03:47.080 --> 3:03:49.080]  It is probably no coincidence that
[3:03:49.080 --> 3:03:51.080]  In India the judiciary still works
[3:03:51.080 --> 3:03:53.080]  Pretty well, the highest
[3:03:53.080 --> 3:03:55.080]  Court in a final decision
[3:03:55.080 --> 3:03:57.080]  In India decided that
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:03:59.080]  Vaccine mandates are
[3:03:59.080 --> 3:04:01.080]  Illegal
[3:04:01.080 --> 3:04:03.080]  So we have to fight this
[3:04:03.080 --> 3:04:05.080]  We have to continue to fight this
[3:04:05.080 --> 3:04:07.080]  Without any violence
[3:04:07.080 --> 3:04:09.080]  Because that's what they want
[3:04:09.080 --> 3:04:11.080]  If they get the violence, violence on the streets
[3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:13.080]  That is then their excuse
[3:04:13.080 --> 3:04:15.080]  To bring in their own forces
[3:04:15.080 --> 3:04:17.080]  And we don't want that to happen
[3:04:17.080 --> 3:04:19.080]  That's right, we don't want them to push us into open conflict
[3:04:19.080 --> 3:04:21.080]  We want to intellectually, culturally
[3:04:21.080 --> 3:04:23.080]  And economically
[3:04:23.080 --> 3:04:25.080]  Direct our support and our will
[3:04:25.080 --> 3:04:27.080]  In areas that are peaceful
[3:04:27.080 --> 3:04:29.080]  In the new system
[3:04:29.080 --> 3:04:31.080]  Thank you so much, amazing work

[3:04:43.080 --> 3:04:45.080]  Thank you, Alex
[3:04:45.080 --> 3:04:47.080]  Amazing, wow, that was powerful
[3:04:47.080 --> 3:04:49.080]  Today has been an incredible show
[3:04:49.080 --> 3:04:51.080]  With Dr. Zelinko and Dr. Fulmick
[3:04:51.080 --> 3:04:53.080]  I'm going to come back, hit some final news
[3:04:53.080 --> 3:04:58.080]  In the meantime, stay with us
[3:04:58.080 --> 3:05:00.080]  Taking advantage of one of nature's

[3:05:22.080 --> 3:05:24.080]  Anti-oxidants you want to help support

[3:05:26.080 --> 3:05:28.080]  Blood vessels and more
[3:05:32.080 --> 3:05:34.080]  Don't overlook the power of beetroot
[3:05:34.080 --> 3:05:36.080]  Get your naturally occurring potassium, folate
[3:05:36.080 --> 3:05:39.080]  Vitamin C, iron, selenium
[3:05:39.080 --> 3:05:42.080]  Zinc, vitamin K, and more
[3:05:45.080 --> 3:05:47.080]  With one of nature's greatest treasures
[3:05:47.080 --> 3:05:52.080]  In VasoBeat from InfoWars life today
[3:06:04.080 --> 3:06:07.080]  I know that you're tuned in here
[3:06:07.080 --> 3:06:09.080]  Because you love justice and you love freedom
[3:06:09.080 --> 3:06:11.080]  And you're trying to find out
[3:06:11.080 --> 3:06:14.080]  How to survive and how to make your family thrive
[3:06:14.080 --> 3:06:16.080]  I'm in the same boat
[3:06:16.080 --> 3:06:18.080]  I'm not here giving out all the knowledge
[3:06:18.080 --> 3:06:20.080]  Like I've got all the answers
[3:06:20.080 --> 3:06:22.080]  We're coming to these conclusions
[3:06:22.080 --> 3:06:24.080]  Collectively together
[3:06:24.080 --> 3:06:26.080]  But I got to tell you
[3:06:27.080 --> 3:06:30.080]  Just realizing the globalists are out to get us
[3:06:30.080 --> 3:06:33.080]  And beginning the thought processes
[3:06:33.080 --> 3:06:36.080]  Of what they're up to is victory
[3:06:36.080 --> 3:06:38.080]  They don't even want to be identified
[3:06:38.080 --> 3:06:40.080]  As the new world order
[3:06:40.080 --> 3:06:42.080]  Much less how we try to figure out
[3:06:42.080 --> 3:06:44.080]  How to beat them
[3:06:44.080 --> 3:06:46.080]  They're doing all of this because they're desperate
[3:06:46.080 --> 3:06:48.080]  They know they're losing
[3:06:48.080 --> 3:06:51.080]  But I can tell you something right now
[3:06:53.080 --> 3:06:56.080]  InfoWars has been through a long 28-year history
[3:06:56.080 --> 3:06:59.080]  Of serious intense learning
[3:06:59.080 --> 3:07:01.080]  As we fought the globalists
[3:07:01.080 --> 3:07:03.080]  And as we learned more
[3:07:03.080 --> 3:07:05.080]  And as we went through different attacks
[3:07:05.080 --> 3:07:07.080]  And different tribulations
[3:07:07.080 --> 3:07:09.080]  We got stronger and stronger
[3:07:09.080 --> 3:07:11.080]  And now I can tell you we're in that zone
[3:07:11.080 --> 3:07:13.080]  Of completion
[3:07:13.080 --> 3:07:15.080]  And now everything we're doing
[3:07:15.080 --> 3:07:17.080]  Is what everything was building towards
[3:07:17.080 --> 3:07:20.080]  If you think InfoWars
[3:07:20.080 --> 3:07:22.080]  Waking up people to the new world order
[3:07:22.080 --> 3:07:24.080]  Exposing the globalist pedophile ranks
[3:07:24.080 --> 3:07:26.080]  Exposing the GMO takeover
[3:07:26.080 --> 3:07:30.080]  If you think that was powerful before
[3:07:30.080 --> 3:07:32.080]  Think again
[3:07:32.080 --> 3:07:34.080]  Because what is happening now
[3:07:34.080 --> 3:07:36.080]  Is the most important thing
[3:07:36.080 --> 3:07:38.080]  This operation has ever done
[3:07:38.080 --> 3:07:40.080]  And I want to explain something
[3:07:40.080 --> 3:07:42.080]  When I give that credit
[3:07:42.080 --> 3:07:44.080]  To you, that's not to patch you on the head
[3:07:44.080 --> 3:07:47.080]  That's so you realize that this is you
[3:07:47.080 --> 3:07:50.080]  Your word of mouth, your prayer, your support
[3:07:50.080 --> 3:07:52.080]  You buying the products
[3:07:52.080 --> 3:07:54.080]  All of that brought us
[3:07:54.080 --> 3:07:57.080]  To this point together today
[3:07:58.080 --> 3:08:00.080]  And so I would expect that actually
[3:08:00.080 --> 3:08:02.080]  In God's mystery that we're maxed out
[3:08:02.080 --> 3:08:04.080]  We're out of funds, we're on empty
[3:08:04.080 --> 3:08:06.080]  Because that's where humanity is
[3:08:08.080 --> 3:08:10.080]  We're not going to come into the final round
[3:08:10.080 --> 3:08:12.080]  Of this fight and be like
[3:08:12.080 --> 3:08:14.080]  Like we got the first round, we all feel great
[3:08:14.080 --> 3:08:16.080]  We just jumped a bunch of rope
[3:08:16.080 --> 3:08:18.080]  And we're now in the ring
[3:08:18.080 --> 3:08:20.080]  We've been in 11 rounds of war
[3:08:20.080 --> 3:08:23.080]  And it's about who's got the will now
[3:08:23.080 --> 3:08:25.080]  At this point
[3:08:25.080 --> 3:08:27.080]  So when you spread the word about the broadcast
[3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:29.080]  When you pray for the broadcast
[3:08:29.080 --> 3:08:31.080]  And that's the most important
[3:08:31.080 --> 3:08:33.080]  And when you buy the products
[3:08:33.080 --> 3:08:35.080]  When you do that, you're in the fight
[3:08:35.080 --> 3:08:37.080]  For your own life, you're in the fight for the future
[3:08:37.080 --> 3:08:39.080]  There's a lot of fraud, there's Hollywood out there
[3:08:39.080 --> 3:08:41.080]  But this is the real deal
[3:08:41.080 --> 3:08:43.080]  Everybody knows it, this is the real deal
[3:08:43.080 --> 3:08:45.080]  That's why they hate it, this is the genuine
[3:08:45.080 --> 3:08:47.080]  You are the genuine
[3:08:47.080 --> 3:08:49.080]  We're the real thing here
[3:08:49.080 --> 3:08:51.080]  They can't stand it, so
[3:08:51.080 --> 3:08:53.080]  Go to infowarstore.com
[3:08:53.080 --> 3:08:55.080]  I talked about this earlier today
[3:08:55.080 --> 3:08:57.080]  Because I'm just doing accounting and math
[3:08:57.080 --> 3:08:59.080]  Trying to find money, and they keep telling me
[3:08:59.080 --> 3:09:01.080]  Some of the years, but I finally got the accounting
[3:09:01.080 --> 3:09:03.080]  Over 200 t-shirts
[3:09:03.080 --> 3:09:05.080]  That I've designed the last couple of years
[3:09:05.080 --> 3:09:07.080]  That I never promoted almost all of them
[3:09:07.080 --> 3:09:09.080]  I got ordered 5,000 t-shirts
[3:09:09.080 --> 3:09:11.080]  Okay
[3:09:11.080 --> 3:09:13.080]  Most of it you never saw, never pushed
[3:09:13.080 --> 3:09:15.080]  We'll order 1,000 of them, we sell 10 of them
[3:09:15.080 --> 3:09:17.080]  We have
[3:09:17.080 --> 3:09:19.080]  Almost $500,000
[3:09:19.080 --> 3:09:21.080]  At cost
[3:09:21.080 --> 3:09:23.080]  Of t-shirts
[3:09:23.080 --> 3:09:25.080]  It's my fault, because
[3:09:25.080 --> 3:09:27.080]  I just want to make this shirt, make that shirt
[3:09:27.080 --> 3:09:29.080]  You can't even find them all
[3:09:29.080 --> 3:09:31.080]  We're going to try to build a site
[3:09:31.080 --> 3:09:33.080]  On infowarstore.com in the next few days
[3:09:33.080 --> 3:09:35.080]  That has all 220 something
[3:09:35.080 --> 3:09:37.080]  On it
[3:09:37.080 --> 3:09:39.080]  And these are limited edition
[3:09:39.080 --> 3:09:41.080]  Shirts
[3:09:41.080 --> 3:09:43.080]  And so we're going to sell them at cost
[3:09:43.080 --> 3:09:45.080]  Some of them are sold at cost right now
[3:09:45.080 --> 3:09:47.080]  Some aren't, doesn't matter
[3:09:47.080 --> 3:09:49.080]  I just need to pay the bills and stay on air
[3:09:49.080 --> 3:09:51.080]  And in the future I'm going to have 2 or 3 shirts we sell
[3:09:51.080 --> 3:09:53.080]  They'll be limited edition, we'll move the next shirt
[3:09:53.080 --> 3:09:55.080]  Not, oh I like this, I like that, do this, do that
[3:09:55.080 --> 3:09:57.080]  I like this design, I like that design
[3:09:57.080 --> 3:09:59.080]  I mean all these things is outshifts
[3:09:59.080 --> 3:10:01.080]  This is all stuff I came up with
[3:10:01.080 --> 3:10:03.080]  All things I did, that's why
[3:10:03.080 --> 3:10:05.080]  I've done this with you, some of it's the best shirts ever
[3:10:05.080 --> 3:10:07.080]  Some of it's like, okay it's an okay shirt
[3:10:07.080 --> 3:10:09.080]  The point is it funds the operation
[3:10:09.080 --> 3:10:11.080]  And you can get it very inexpensively right now
[3:10:11.080 --> 3:10:13.080]  At infowarstore.com

[3:10:15.080 --> 3:10:17.080]  Clear this inventory out
[3:10:17.080 --> 3:10:19.080]  Because we're doing the math and we're like

[3:10:21.080 --> 3:10:23.080]  A month in the hole

[3:10:25.080 --> 3:10:27.080]  But nobody's buying product, what's going on

[3:10:55.080 --> 3:10:57.080]  Gun control work shirts

[3:10:59.080 --> 3:11:01.080]  But these are all limited editions
[3:11:01.080 --> 3:11:03.080]  They're over

[3:12:53.080 --> 3:12:55.080]  I want to thank you all
[3:12:55.080 --> 3:12:57.080]  For your support
[3:12:57.080 --> 3:12:59.080]  Of what you've been doing because
[3:12:59.080 --> 3:13:01.080]  We are up against the New World Order
[3:13:01.080 --> 3:13:03.080]  At point blank range
[3:13:03.080 --> 3:13:05.080]  And we are reaching millions and millions of people today
[3:13:05.080 --> 3:13:07.080]  And it's true
[3:13:07.080 --> 3:13:09.080]  We are reaching world leaders
[3:13:09.080 --> 3:13:11.080]  And all the major thought leaders
[3:13:11.080 --> 3:13:13.080]  Because we are ahead of the curve here
[3:13:13.080 --> 3:13:15.080]  And used to
[3:13:15.080 --> 3:13:17.080]  I was 90% of all the breaking stuff
[3:13:17.080 --> 3:13:19.080]  Now I'm about 50%
[3:13:19.080 --> 3:13:21.080]  As soon as we get
[3:13:21.080 --> 3:13:23.080]  To where I'm not the one always
[3:13:23.080 --> 3:13:25.080]  Breaking the original data and
[3:13:25.080 --> 3:13:27.080]  Trailblazing
[3:13:27.080 --> 3:13:29.080]  I'm going to end this
[3:13:29.080 --> 3:13:31.080]  But we're not there yet
[3:13:31.080 --> 3:13:33.080]  And then I'll sit back
[3:13:33.080 --> 3:13:35.080]  And if I see something going on I'm going to come out
[3:13:35.080 --> 3:13:37.080]  But I've done 28 years of this
[3:13:37.080 --> 3:13:39.080]  And I've almost completed my mission
[3:13:39.080 --> 3:13:41.080]  But this next year or two is the most
[3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:43.080]  Important part of my mission ever
[3:13:43.080 --> 3:13:45.080]  And I need funds
[3:13:45.080 --> 3:13:47.080]  And I need prayer
[3:13:47.080 --> 3:13:49.080]  To absolutely smash the enemy
[3:13:49.080 --> 3:13:51.080]  Because you know that famous Internet saying
[3:13:51.080 --> 3:13:53.080]  If the situation was hopeless
[3:13:53.080 --> 3:13:55.080]  The propaganda
[3:13:55.080 --> 3:13:57.080]  Would not be necessary
[3:13:57.080 --> 3:13:59.080]  They're not trying to censor you and me
[3:13:59.080 --> 3:14:01.080]  They're not trying to suppress us
[3:14:01.080 --> 3:14:03.080]  They're not trying to intimidate us
[3:14:03.080 --> 3:14:05.080]  They're not trying to debank us
[3:14:05.080 --> 3:14:07.080]  Because we're weak
[3:14:07.080 --> 3:14:09.080]  They're doing it because we are strong
[3:14:09.080 --> 3:14:11.080]  And so all you've done over these years
[3:14:11.080 --> 3:14:13.080]  Maximize it
[3:14:13.080 --> 3:14:15.080]  In word of mouth now
[3:14:15.080 --> 3:14:17.920]  All you've done in prayer, maximize it now.
[3:14:17.920 --> 3:14:19.800]  And all you've done buying products
[3:14:19.800 --> 3:14:22.040]  and then FullWordStore.com, maximize it
[3:14:22.040 --> 3:14:24.800]  so that I can go into this big fight now,
[3:14:24.800 --> 3:14:26.800]  full power against the establishment
[3:14:26.800 --> 3:14:29.440]  who just shaken fear and hatred
[3:14:29.440 --> 3:14:31.880]  because together with God's Holy Spirit,
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:34.720]  we have broken the enemy over and over again
[3:14:34.720 --> 3:14:39.720]  and this place just effervescently spews success and victory.
[3:14:40.440 --> 3:14:42.840]  All of our guests, all of our guest hosts,
[3:14:42.840 --> 3:14:45.160]  all of our callers, everything we do
[3:14:45.160 --> 3:14:49.280]  is human strength through God and it's absolutely beautiful.
[3:14:49.280 --> 3:14:52.800]  The only way you fail, and I don't care which three you do
[3:14:52.800 --> 3:14:55.640]  or if you do all three, that'd be great, pray for us.
[3:14:55.640 --> 3:14:57.960]  Spread the word about us, buy the products.
[3:14:57.960 --> 3:15:00.960]  Buy the products, spread the word, pray for us.
[3:15:00.960 --> 3:15:03.640]  Pray for us, spread the word, buy the products.
[3:15:03.640 --> 3:15:06.880]  But whatever you do, take action now.
[3:15:06.880 --> 3:15:08.800]  And if you think there's some other talk show us
[3:15:08.800 --> 3:15:11.160]  or some other places with a better job,
[3:15:11.160 --> 3:15:14.720]  I mean support them, but whatever you do now,
[3:15:14.720 --> 3:15:16.600]  this is the big test when the pedophiles
[3:15:16.600 --> 3:15:17.760]  are coming out in the open
[3:15:17.760 --> 3:15:19.760]  and the world government's coming out in the open
[3:15:19.760 --> 3:15:21.960]  and the crime's exploding and all of it,
[3:15:21.960 --> 3:15:24.560]  this is the time for us to shine.
[3:15:24.560 --> 3:15:25.400]  Thank you for your support.

[3:16:00.840 --> 3:16:01.640]  Granny Do Right!
[3:16:01.640 --> 3:16:03.280]  Thanks for holding her on the air, glad.
[3:16:03.280 --> 3:16:06.320]  Yeah, and first of all, let me say I love your product.
[3:16:06.320 --> 3:16:07.240]  I am a granny
[3:16:07.240 --> 3:16:12.920]  and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[3:16:12.920 --> 3:16:18.360]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots, as they're lovingly called. But since taking your
[3:16:18.360 --> 3:16:24.440]  X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually. People think I'm 55
[3:16:24.440 --> 3:16:30.120]  years old. And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well,
[3:16:30.120 --> 3:16:34.520]  maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when
[3:16:34.520 --> 3:16:39.000]  I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately. But, you know, over a period of
[3:16:39.000 --> 3:16:44.680]  time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful,
[3:16:44.680 --> 3:16:50.280]  you know, I don't, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway,
[3:16:50.280 --> 3:16:53.880]  it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[3:16:55.480 --> 3:17:00.280]  The newest product from FullWarsLife is now available exclusively in FullWarsTour.com.

[3:18:05.880 --> 3:18:11.800]  your system with a supplement that contains both. This InfoWarsLife offering vitamin C plus zinc
[3:18:11.800 --> 3:18:17.160]  with rose hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store. The rose hips contained within
[3:18:17.160 --> 3:18:23.080]  are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds. Natural
[3:18:23.080 --> 3:18:28.360]  chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions including
[3:18:28.360 --> 3:18:34.120]  those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown. As for vitamin
[3:18:34.120 --> 3:18:39.160]  C and zinc themselves you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition,
[3:18:39.160 --> 3:18:44.440]  immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health. It has been reported that intake of both
[3:18:44.440 --> 3:18:50.120]  is often inadequate even in affluent populations like here in America. So next time you visit be
[3:18:50.120 --> 3:18:55.080]  sure to check it out at InfoWarsTour.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[3:18:56.760 --> 3:19:02.200]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training probably not as much as they
[3:19:02.200 --> 3:19:07.560]  should be but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for InfoWarsTour.com. Before I
[3:19:07.560 --> 3:19:13.080]  start out on a run I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going you
[3:19:13.080 --> 3:19:19.080]  know besides the energy turbo force it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep me
[3:19:19.080 --> 3:19:24.600]  healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy giving me the best
[3:19:24.600 --> 3:19:30.360]  chance at getting through the training. And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones's Sorilis.
[3:19:30.360 --> 3:19:35.640]  I have bad joints thanks mom. So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need
[3:19:35.640 --> 3:19:41.160]  right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility. The quick release capsules help
[3:19:41.160 --> 3:19:46.280]  me recover fast so I can get back to the training. Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a
[3:19:46.280 --> 3:19:51.960]  marathon good news turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day
[3:19:51.960 --> 3:19:55.000]  and Sorilis can keep you moving and feeling great at NEH.
[3:19:55.000 --> 3:20:16.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm Kate Daly from Kate Daly Radio your guest host. Wow
[3:20:16.200 --> 3:20:21.160]  what a great show today Alex. I love the guests and very powerful and by the way we're going to
[3:20:21.160 --> 3:20:25.320]  need our vitamins so make sure you're taking those supplements he was talking about and also the
[3:20:25.320 --> 3:20:29.800]  t-shirts the supplements are so important because we need our immune systems we need we need to get
[3:20:29.800 --> 3:20:37.080]  them in tip-top shape right now. So I have a great guest for you today in fact very powerful guest
[3:20:37.080 --> 3:20:41.880]  and I'm always looking to challenge myself in my thinking and have you know my covering everything
[3:20:41.880 --> 3:20:46.440]  and my talking about everything that needs to be talked about and especially those that involve
[3:20:46.440 --> 3:20:51.720]  sleight of hand with the deep state because we know that's a huge constant tactic for them.
[3:20:51.720 --> 3:20:56.440]  So the topic today is little talked about so of course I'm interested and intrigued and I've
[3:20:56.440 --> 3:21:01.560]  invited Bart Sabrell on with me because let me just tell you he's written some fantastic books
[3:21:01.560 --> 3:21:08.840]  he's an award-winning filmmaker writer investigative journalist and also has produced many television
[3:21:08.840 --> 3:21:14.200]  programs and documentaries Fox HBO you name it a funny thing happened on the way to the moon
[3:21:14.200 --> 3:21:19.880]  that's how I met him before and then of course astronauts gone wild and his latest is moon man
[3:21:19.880 --> 3:21:24.120]  the true story of a filmmaker on the cia hit list welcome Bart how are you
[3:21:25.240 --> 3:21:31.480]  you're good Kate how about yourself I'm excellent I'm excellent so Planet X is a topic that I've
[3:21:31.480 --> 3:21:38.680]  talked a little about to tell you the truth and uh and I'm intrigued by it because I read about
[3:21:38.680 --> 3:21:43.880]  about it from you and I want to talk about Planet X a little bit more because I thought you had some
[3:21:43.880 --> 3:21:49.000]  very original ideas about this and some very interesting comments and so I can't wait to get
[3:21:49.000 --> 3:21:56.440]  into this with you so tell me about Planet X early on our first our first um really kind of you
[3:21:56.440 --> 3:22:01.400]  know the in first information that we received about Planet X and why this is so important and
[3:22:01.400 --> 3:22:08.040]  it's so little talked about well there used to be a video it was online they took it down
[3:22:08.040 --> 3:22:12.760]  when people started investigating Planet X it was actually a NASA promotional video I think for
[3:22:12.760 --> 3:22:20.760]  1972 when they launched Pioneer 10 and it said that the purpose of it was to find Planet X and then
[3:22:20.760 --> 3:22:26.520]  when they launched Voyager 1 and 2 a few years later by having three spacecraft in the area
[3:22:26.520 --> 3:22:32.840]  they intended to triangulate the location and even the Washington Post and other magazines
[3:22:32.840 --> 3:22:38.840]  newspapers uh admitted that they have found Planet X with a special infrared telescope
[3:22:38.840 --> 3:22:44.680]  because you can't see it with an optical telescope and then no one ever talks about it for another
[3:22:44.680 --> 3:22:49.960]  20 years and another generation of people find it and then they don't talk about it again when I
[3:22:49.960 --> 3:22:55.080]  was researching the film a funny thing happened on the way to the moon I remember talking to a
[3:22:55.080 --> 3:23:01.480]  senior executive at NASA and he said yes you're right Bart they did not go to the moon however
[3:23:01.480 --> 3:23:07.080]  there's a more important topic that you should investigate I'm like well tell me and he said
[3:23:07.080 --> 3:23:13.480]  Planet X of course asked what is that all about he said it's a rogue planet that is expected to
[3:23:13.480 --> 3:23:20.120]  come a near past to Earth in the first half of the next century at the time it was like 30 years
[3:23:20.120 --> 3:23:25.160]  or so into the future so I'm like well whatever I've got more important things to think about
[3:23:25.160 --> 3:23:31.240]  and now that God has allowed me allowed me to live another 30 years oh I guess uh it's about
[3:23:31.240 --> 3:23:37.560]  that time isn't it and then you know you know about allegedly the style of the people to run the
[3:23:37.560 --> 3:23:43.720]  world you can call them Illuminati or whatever their you know style is to technically warn people
[3:23:44.520 --> 3:23:50.440]  about what they're doing so about three years ago a lot of the mainstream science magazines
[3:23:50.440 --> 3:23:56.440]  and I can show them to you but you know science.com National Geographic and many others released
[3:23:56.440 --> 3:24:02.200]  multiple articles saying rogue planets are very real and that there's actually statistically
[3:24:02.200 --> 3:24:09.400]  two rogue planets for every solar system. Rogue planets either just free float through the solar
[3:24:09.400 --> 3:24:13.960]  system and they're generally about seven times larger than the Earth and of course they could
[3:24:13.960 --> 3:24:20.920]  collide with the Earth or they have this eccentric tilted orbit kind of like a comet and so when I
[3:24:20.920 --> 3:24:27.960]  started researching this I was alarmed to discover that both the historical record and the biblical
[3:24:27.960 --> 3:24:36.200]  record of such events actually match and when I talked to a completely you know secular non-believer
[3:24:36.200 --> 3:24:41.880]  scientist who believes in rogue planets he kind of listed the things that would happen if one came
[3:24:41.880 --> 3:24:47.400]  near the earth like an increase of earthquakes, meteor showers, tidal effects, things like that
[3:24:47.400 --> 3:24:52.600]  and I said well wait a minute that's exactly what the Bible says is going to happen in the last days
[3:24:52.600 --> 3:24:58.840]  there'll be meteor storms Jesus said the stars will fall like ripe figs that's a meteor storm
[3:24:58.840 --> 3:25:05.000]  in fact one of the greatest events in human history hardly anybody knows about it it's not
[3:25:05.000 --> 3:25:12.600]  part of the university and that is that prior to the year 705 BC every civilization of the world
[3:25:12.600 --> 3:25:19.080]  that had good astronomers like the Mayans the Sumerians the Egyptians the Hebrews and the
[3:25:19.080 --> 3:25:28.440]  Chinese they all had the earth having a 360 day year that's why there's 360 degrees on a compass
[3:25:28.440 --> 3:25:36.200]  and then all of a sudden around 705 BC something happened and immediately after all those civilizations
[3:25:36.200 --> 3:25:43.320]  changed their calendars to 365 and a quarter so what happened obviously is that the earth
[3:25:43.320 --> 3:25:51.240]  was pulled further away from the sun slightly in fact this is recorded indirectly in 2 Kings
[3:25:51.240 --> 3:25:58.120]  chapter 20 when the prophet Isaiah said show me a sign that King Ezekiah is going to live another
[3:25:58.120 --> 3:26:03.560]  15 years and God said I can make the sundial go forward or back what would you like and he's like
[3:26:03.560 --> 3:26:10.360]  I think the back is harder so show me that it wasn't really a sundial it was steps and so each step
[3:26:10.360 --> 3:26:16.440]  theoretically represented an hour so rather than the earth having to go you know backwards and then
[3:26:16.440 --> 3:26:22.040]  forwards again the earth would simply have to tilt and maybe that's where our tilt came from
[3:26:22.040 --> 3:26:28.840]  and then when I read the book of Isaiah recently I realized that not only is the book of Daniel
[3:26:28.840 --> 3:26:34.920]  and Revelation about the last days Isaiah is about the last days over and over again when it says
[3:26:34.920 --> 3:26:42.280]  the day of the Lord that's the second coming so guess what it says in Isaiah 13 13 it says about
[3:26:42.280 --> 3:26:49.960]  the last days the coming days of the Lord the earth will be moved out of its place just like it was
[3:26:49.960 --> 3:26:56.680]  in 705 BC absolutely in fact there's several references to that that I have found because
[3:26:56.680 --> 3:27:00.920]  really intriguing because you have to wonder how that exactly happens and this does not
[3:27:00.920 --> 3:27:07.400]  planet x does not rotate normally and so this is something that is also what intrigued me about
[3:27:07.400 --> 3:27:13.080]  this part was it so little talked about no one brings this up and if they do they never bring
[3:27:13.080 --> 3:27:18.920]  it up again just like what was it a Harrington from the naval observatory talked about it never
[3:27:18.920 --> 3:27:25.000]  talked about it again that's weird I wrote an article it took me about 200 hours to write I've
[3:27:25.000 --> 3:27:31.320]  done 30 drafts of it based on 500 hours of research you can read it at cibral s's and
[3:27:31.320 --> 3:27:39.880]  sam ibeas and boy re l cibral.com and it's full of mind boggling discoveries for example the most
[3:27:39.880 --> 3:27:46.920]  powerful telescope in the world is owned by the Vatican and the Jesuit sect of the Vatican which is
[3:27:46.920 --> 3:27:56.040]  kind of like their CIA and it is named get this the Lucifer telescope now why would an alleged
[3:27:56.040 --> 3:28:02.360]  Christian organization you know name something after Lucifer so there was a guy named Malachi
[3:28:02.360 --> 3:28:08.840]  Martin and on his deathbed he disavowed the sect because of their criminality and he said that the
[3:28:08.840 --> 3:28:15.880]  Lucifer telescope is tracking an object that will play a significant part in world history in the
[3:28:15.880 --> 3:28:25.320]  last days I think they're tracking planet X which they have dubbed planet Lucifer the destroyer and
[3:28:25.320 --> 3:28:34.200]  oddly enough in 1045 AD the Chinese saw a passing of planet X and they called it the dragon because
[3:28:34.200 --> 3:28:40.920]  once it does become visible it becomes red and had wings of meteor storms on each side of it so we
[3:28:40.920 --> 3:28:47.080]  have all these indications dropping in that this could very well be true we're going to come right
[3:28:47.080 --> 3:28:51.000]  back more with Bart Cibral when we come back you're not going to want to miss this you've got to hear
[3:28:51.000 --> 3:28:57.640]  this be right back i'm k dally your guest host you know it's a fact and i'm not bragging when
[3:28:57.640 --> 3:29:04.280]  i say it it's just true that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty

[3:33:13.000 --> 3:33:17.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show and of course i'm k dally your guest host from k dally radio dot
[3:33:17.960 --> 3:33:23.560]  com you know very few topics i've covered just about every single topic i can imagine and whenever
[3:33:23.560 --> 3:33:28.120]  it came to planet x i always just sort of rolled my eyes and just kept walking because i always
[3:33:28.120 --> 3:33:33.800]  thought it was a really weird concept right and uh and no one was ever talking about it
[3:33:33.800 --> 3:33:39.480]  so i just sort of bypassed it all together but bart actually brought up some really wonderful
[3:33:39.480 --> 3:33:44.520]  things about this that i had not talked about and ever and when i say wonderful i mean kind of
[3:33:44.520 --> 3:33:51.000]  scary about this topic and really made me think about about this in a totally different way in
[3:33:51.000 --> 3:33:55.960]  fact when you brought up the fact that janet napolitano in your writings outgoing director of
[3:33:55.960 --> 3:34:01.160]  homeland security said something kind of startling and alarming right as she was leaving in her fair
[3:34:01.160 --> 3:34:06.040]  well speech she said a natural disaster the likes of which the nation has never seen bart
[3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:11.960]  is likely on its way and i thought and like you wait we have seen everything we've seen tornadoes
[3:34:11.960 --> 3:34:16.360]  we've seen we've seen tsunamis we've seen just about everything we can see what do you mean like
[3:34:16.360 --> 3:34:21.640]  the likely the the likes of which the nation is never seen that was interesting i hadn't thought
[3:34:21.640 --> 3:34:26.840]  about it that way there's actually three clues there you know it's interesting that just as
[3:34:26.840 --> 3:34:32.120]  eisenhower had his uh deep state warning the last day in office so they wouldn't shoot him
[3:34:32.120 --> 3:34:37.080]  she said something hurt last day in office you know kind of like her way of you know being
[3:34:37.080 --> 3:34:42.200]  able to sleep at night i guess there's actually three clues in that we know that it's a natural
[3:34:42.200 --> 3:34:48.280]  disaster what is coming and i think this whole coronavirus thing is actually a psychological
[3:34:48.280 --> 3:34:55.560]  drill for that event to kind of train people to submit to emergency you know martial law
[3:34:55.560 --> 3:35:03.400]  then the second clue is that it's never happened in the 246 years of america and it is a natural
[3:35:03.400 --> 3:35:11.400]  disaster you could know about a decade or more in advance because you said that in 2013 so we've
[3:35:11.400 --> 3:35:17.080]  seen like you said volcanoes hurricanes everything else and those cannot be predicted in advance the
[3:35:17.080 --> 3:35:23.240]  only natural disaster that the united states has never seen that you could predict years in advance
[3:35:23.240 --> 3:35:30.200]  has to be something coming from outer space because of the mathematical precision of being able to
[3:35:30.200 --> 3:35:36.440]  you know calculate the position and trajectory of comets asteroids and potentially in this case
[3:35:36.440 --> 3:35:42.200]  a rogue planet remember jesus said that in the last days there would be greater tribulation
[3:35:42.200 --> 3:35:47.560]  than in the whole history of the world and i believe that's because we're going to have every
[3:35:47.560 --> 3:35:54.520]  possible disaster happening simultaneously economic collapse pandemic food shortages
[3:35:54.520 --> 3:35:59.960]  increase or earthquakes and meteor storms and there's many warnings about this in the book of
[3:35:59.960 --> 3:36:06.440]  revelation my best source thinks that planet x is about seven times larger than the earth which
[3:36:06.440 --> 3:36:12.920]  would be about 30 times larger than the moon so one of the warnings that jesus gave interestingly
[3:36:12.920 --> 3:36:20.120]  about the last days is he said men's hearts will melt with fear because of the tossing
[3:36:20.120 --> 3:36:27.000]  and turning of the seas now we have daily tidal effect that in some cases makes the ocean go in
[3:36:27.000 --> 3:36:34.280]  and out about 20 feet but massive tossing and turning of the seas could very well be caused
[3:36:34.280 --> 3:36:41.320]  by an object 30 times larger than the moon coming by and so there are many indications he said there
[3:36:41.320 --> 3:36:47.240]  would be a greater increase in earthquakes well earthquakes have increased by about 1000 percent
[3:36:47.240 --> 3:36:53.400]  in the last 10 years and some believe it's because of the gravitational tational effects as planet x
[3:36:53.400 --> 3:37:00.760]  approaches wow you know um one thing that you said that really struck me and i'd never really
[3:37:00.760 --> 3:37:04.680]  thought about it in this way you brought up a lot of things we're only hitting on a few but
[3:37:04.680 --> 3:37:09.320]  that um in the scriptures it talks about it it will come as a thief in the night and what's
[3:37:09.320 --> 3:37:13.400]  interesting is is we talk about all the things that can happen and i always thought all of the
[3:37:13.400 --> 3:37:18.680]  things that you just mentioned would come by way of say harp would come by way of say um manipulation
[3:37:18.680 --> 3:37:22.280]  by the deep state i know they can manipulate weather they can manipulate a lot of things they
[3:37:22.280 --> 3:37:26.760]  could even do underwater nukes they could do all kinds of things to cause the water to rise and
[3:37:26.760 --> 3:37:31.640]  things like this but it was interesting when you said thief of thief of the night uh thief in the
[3:37:31.640 --> 3:37:37.000]  night because i started really examining that phrase it was such a different it's such a different
[3:37:37.000 --> 3:37:42.600]  way to think about it in the fact that no one talks about this talk about misdirection if this
[3:37:42.600 --> 3:37:47.640]  is something that's coming and they know it this is why they built all the bunkers very interesting
[3:37:47.640 --> 3:37:54.440]  to go hide in of course but not for us right not the peons then it would be as a thief in the night
[3:37:54.440 --> 3:37:59.080]  if no one's ever discussing it no one's talking about it and anyone that does talk about it never
[3:37:59.080 --> 3:38:04.600]  talks about it again i thought that was fascinating i've been you know studying like everybody else
[3:38:04.600 --> 3:38:10.760]  in our circles the you know covid fake pandemic for quite a while and it was only very recently
[3:38:10.760 --> 3:38:17.880]  i came to an expanded conclusion as to exactly why they are doing it number one it's a psychological
[3:38:17.880 --> 3:38:24.360]  drill to program people to submit to the government during national emergencies we know that these
[3:38:24.360 --> 3:38:30.760]  injections are deadly the VP of Pfizer said so himself and said in almost disbelief they must
[3:38:30.760 --> 3:38:36.120]  be wanting to kill hundreds of millions of people there's no other explanation now why are they doing
[3:38:36.120 --> 3:38:43.960]  that i think they know this event is coming planet x a comet asteroid or all of them and if it does
[3:38:43.960 --> 3:38:50.840]  and when it does it could kill half the world's population in six months they don't want to shock
[3:38:50.840 --> 3:38:56.760]  the earth that way they like to travel they like to go to hotels and have restaurants so they're
[3:38:56.760 --> 3:39:02.600]  killing off segments of the population gradually because they consider everyone
[3:39:02.600 --> 3:39:09.240]  they're going to die anyway and what a coincidence that the first people who get phase one congratulations
[3:39:09.240 --> 3:39:16.120]  are the very same list as on hitler's useless eaters the disabled the you know the diabetic
[3:39:16.120 --> 3:39:22.440]  the elderly the overweight so i believe these injections are designed to lower the population
[3:39:22.440 --> 3:39:28.920]  gradually so that when the cosmic event happens most of the population or whatever percentage
[3:39:28.920 --> 3:39:36.200]  they've designed will already be dead and it'll be less of a shock to society right also great
[3:39:36.200 --> 3:39:41.320]  points by the way also you know as far as it hitting the whole world there's a lot of references
[3:39:41.320 --> 3:39:46.360]  to that in the good book you know there's a lot of things that say the whole world will be impacted
[3:39:46.360 --> 3:39:52.280]  and when i used to think about um uh you know meteors and things like that coming down a lot
[3:39:52.280 --> 3:39:56.920]  of people would be affected a lot of land would be affected but it would be more targeted this
[3:39:56.920 --> 3:40:04.440]  actually would affect the whole world at one time yeah you know uh the book of joel is quoted in
[3:40:04.440 --> 3:40:10.760]  acts at the first preaching of the word uh to strangers and they say that in the last days
[3:40:10.760 --> 3:40:17.160]  which is now many believers will have dreams and visions well i had a heart procedure recently
[3:40:17.160 --> 3:40:21.480]  they didn't have to cut me open thank goodness but they went into a vein and poked a hole in my heart
[3:40:21.480 --> 3:40:27.640]  and all that uh when when i woke up maybe from the anesthesia was such a good rest i mean i was
[3:40:27.640 --> 3:40:36.280]  just wide awake for more than 24 hours and the split second i fell asleep i saw a literal vision
[3:40:36.280 --> 3:40:41.400]  of white letters in front of me just like at the beginning of a funny thing happened on the way to
[3:40:41.400 --> 3:40:49.880]  the moon of the scriptures there and it said luke 21 11 and that's pretty specific right so i looked
[3:40:49.880 --> 3:40:56.840]  at it and it's jesus answering the questions about the signs of the end of the age he said there will
[3:40:56.840 --> 3:41:07.800]  be great signs in the heavens and disease pandemics and food shortages and then about two months ago
[3:41:07.800 --> 3:41:13.560]  i had a dream and in the dream i saw the front license plate of a car now in my state you're
[3:41:13.560 --> 3:41:19.960]  only required to have one on the back the front you can put whatever you want it said mark 13
[3:41:19.960 --> 3:41:28.440]  13 through 14 now that's pretty specific isn't it so i looked that up too and it's again jesus
[3:41:28.440 --> 3:41:36.360]  talking about the last days and the part of that that stood out to me kate is flee to the mountains
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:43.800]  so i thank god is telling me in the first time the end times have begun no more wondering about it
[3:41:43.800 --> 3:41:50.760]  this is it and in the second dream i thank god is telling me now is the time to flee to the mountains
[3:41:50.760 --> 3:41:57.320]  or prepare physically now a lot of believers i know they say that well god will take care of them
[3:41:57.320 --> 3:42:02.760]  but you have to look at what happened in the old testament i have a minister who said that the
[3:42:02.760 --> 3:42:08.840]  tribulation that happened locally like being thrown into a fiery furnace or the famine will
[3:42:08.840 --> 3:42:16.040]  be worldwide in the last days those are symbolic and lessons for us now well joseph predicted the
[3:42:16.040 --> 3:42:22.120]  seven years of coming famine he believed in god more than anybody did god drop food from the sky
[3:42:22.120 --> 3:42:29.000]  for seven years no the bible says god said out of his own mouth my people are destroyed for the lack
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:36.840]  of knowledge he survived the tribulation by preparing for it you see he stocked child food he
[3:42:36.840 --> 3:42:43.240]  was a prepper that's how god provided for him with the knowledge and i think this last dream

[3:44:18.280 --> 3:44:24.600]  it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has
[3:44:24.600 --> 3:44:29.960]  a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions but also work quite well but just aren't as strong
[3:44:29.960 --> 3:44:34.840]  this is like a very fine wine it's it's it's in fact each batch is different sometimes it's super
[3:44:34.840 --> 3:44:38.680]  strong sometimes it's just okay people like why are you selling something and admitting sometimes
[3:44:38.680 --> 3:44:44.120]  the batch isn't strong that's just how it is it's how it works uh so it's always good it's just
[3:44:44.120 --> 3:44:56.520]  sometimes it's like super strong but yeah if you want the rolls royce at a decent price then this is it
[3:44:56.520 --> 3:45:03.320]  we are only offering three coins in the series the first coin was released in december of 2021
[3:45:03.320 --> 3:45:11.240]  and sold out in 10 days now the second coin as we enter the last days of march into april 2022
[3:45:11.240 --> 3:45:16.440]  is now being offered and i believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are
[3:45:16.440 --> 3:45:21.480]  historic coins and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep info wars at

[3:47:16.440 --> 3:47:20.600]  he makes all of us think because i've learned a lot from bart it's been really interesting
[3:47:20.600 --> 3:47:25.480]  this was a topic that i wasn't even interested in until i read bart's piece on it and he brought
[3:47:25.480 --> 3:47:29.960]  up some interesting points so kudos to you bart and of course living on a mountain sounds real
[3:47:29.960 --> 3:47:36.040]  good about now i'm i'm thinking um and getting prepared like you said um you know people prepped
[3:47:36.040 --> 3:47:41.880]  that's how they made it through these times that we can go read about and it's a very very good point
[3:47:41.880 --> 3:47:46.040]  and i appreciate that i hope everybody's getting food storage right now i hope everybody's ordering
[3:47:46.040 --> 3:47:50.680]  extra supplements on alex's site because of food shortages coming you're gonna want those
[3:47:50.680 --> 3:47:54.680]  supplements and by the way they keep on the shelf so i'd get extra also if you haven't
[3:47:54.680 --> 3:47:58.520]  checked out bart sabral's movies and books a funny thing happened on the way to the moon is
[3:47:58.520 --> 3:48:03.880]  how i met bart in the first place and then of course uh his amazing information also moon man
[3:48:03.880 --> 3:48:10.120]  the true story of a filmmaker on the cia hit list and so you must check these out but man planet x
[3:48:10.120 --> 3:48:16.360]  is very very intriguing to me now i love this and i know that you have a clip don't you bart i do
[3:48:17.000 --> 3:48:22.920]  by the way you can get that book at sabral s i b rl dot com the clip you're about to see
[3:48:23.720 --> 3:48:29.240]  is from cnn and they took it down off the internet but one person actually filmed it off the tv on
[3:48:29.240 --> 3:48:35.560]  their cell phone what has been happening in the last five or ten years is normally comets and
[3:48:35.560 --> 3:48:41.880]  asteroids are discovered decades in advance and for some strange reason as you've seen over and
[3:48:41.880 --> 3:48:47.560]  over again they'll say we just found one it's going to be nearby in three days so why is that
[3:48:47.560 --> 3:48:55.400]  happening here is a report where cnn themselves admits that planet x is true and it is the cause
[3:48:55.400 --> 3:49:01.640]  for these coming unpredictable comets and asteroids there's a huge hidden heavenly body
[3:49:01.640 --> 3:49:07.240]  right here in our solar system evidence is mounting that either a brown dwarf star or a gas giant
[3:49:07.240 --> 3:49:13.080]  planet is lurking at the outermost reaches of our solar system far beyond the planet Pluto
[3:49:13.080 --> 3:49:17.480]  according to the british newspaper the independent the object is four times the size of jupiter
[3:49:17.480 --> 3:49:22.440]  experts say the presence of such a massive object could explain why a barrage of comets has been
[3:49:22.440 --> 3:49:31.720]  coming from that direction and there's also uh that's the end of the clip uh there's also very
[3:49:31.720 --> 3:49:39.560]  interesting there's a script whenever you say cnn i'm sorry about that whatever you whenever i
[3:49:39.560 --> 3:49:45.400]  somebody says cnn i have like a pablov reaction i throw up a little bit but but the clip was
[3:49:45.400 --> 3:49:50.120]  interesting because it looks like they didn't really do more than that that was about it right
[3:49:50.120 --> 3:49:56.440]  yeah well that's their illuminati we warned you one time i guess you know and one thing you
[3:49:56.440 --> 3:50:02.360]  mentioned earlier was about people building bunkers and everything you know that's in the bible too
[3:50:02.360 --> 3:50:09.640]  it says in revelation 615 and the kings of the earth and the great men the rich men and the chief
[3:50:09.640 --> 3:50:18.120]  captains and the mighty men they hid themselves in dens and caves and mountains and says it right
[3:50:18.120 --> 3:50:26.360]  there that this is what they will be doing in the last day so something is going on the government's
[3:50:26.360 --> 3:50:31.080]  not going to i actually thought i have okay i have a thought about that too because i'd never
[3:50:31.080 --> 3:50:35.800]  really thought about this until reading your work bar but the fact that they have to hide themselves
[3:50:35.800 --> 3:50:40.440]  up you know they could target harp they can target sir i'm losing my voice they could target
[3:50:40.440 --> 3:50:44.920]  certain things and they could actually bypass them by going to a different place just like you
[3:50:44.920 --> 3:50:51.800]  know 9 11 when they didn't go into the into the towers right so they can be someplace else and so
[3:50:51.800 --> 3:50:57.720]  if it hits the whole world something that hits the entire world they would not have control over
[3:50:57.720 --> 3:51:04.040]  they would have to hide up right all of them correct that's i think why they're doing exactly
[3:51:04.040 --> 3:51:09.240]  what the bible says the people will do in the last days they will dig caves and holes and
[3:51:09.240 --> 3:51:16.600]  mountains to theoretically survive what is coming upon and it says it again the whole world so what
[3:51:16.600 --> 3:51:23.960]  is coming in jesus warned us it signs in the heavens and that the stars will fall like right figs if
[3:51:23.960 --> 3:51:30.360]  planted x does a loop around the sun which my sources believe it will that if there's going to be two
[3:51:30.360 --> 3:51:37.560]  meteor storms one as it comes in and one that it goes out and i remember another dream from like
[3:51:37.560 --> 3:51:44.520]  two years ago i was shown a map of the solar system and a meteor storm heading toward earth
[3:51:45.080 --> 3:51:51.880]  and so even if none of those meteors struck the earth right let's just say you went outside and
[3:51:51.880 --> 3:51:58.840]  all around the world for three days it was non-stop fireworks at night that would get people that would
[3:51:58.840 --> 3:52:04.360]  wake them up because the bible says that all these things that are happening are really to get our
[3:52:04.360 --> 3:52:11.640]  attention so that we have an opportunity a motivation to repent before it's too late to do so so
[3:52:11.640 --> 3:52:18.760]  planet x i believe is god's sign and in a way it's symbolic of lucifer because prior to 705 bc
[3:52:19.480 --> 3:52:28.440]  with every you know uh with a year being 360 days that means every month was exactly 30 days now
[3:52:28.440 --> 3:52:32.440]  you couldn't argue against divine creation could you how could you say everything
[3:52:32.440 --> 3:52:38.600]  happened by chance when every month has exactly 30 days there's 12 months 12 tribes of israel
[3:52:38.600 --> 3:52:44.840]  so the devil if you will planet lucifer uh that the you know vatican is tracking with their lucifer
[3:52:44.840 --> 3:52:52.200]  telescope destroyed god's testimony of divine creation isn't that interesting and it's called a
[3:52:52.200 --> 3:53:02.760]  rogue planet a rebeller who doesn't obey god's laws wow interesting and uh and there are some
[3:53:02.760 --> 3:53:07.960]  scriptures that say the entire heavens will be violently shaken i'm not quite sure any amount
[3:53:07.960 --> 3:53:14.120]  of harp could probably carry that out and so it is you know you really made me think and i i'm
[3:53:14.120 --> 3:53:18.440]  surprised because i'm serious this is a topic that i just didn't give much thought to i just thought
[3:53:18.440 --> 3:53:23.560]  it was like a scare tactic of something that we'll never see in our lifetime but the more you talk
[3:53:23.560 --> 3:53:27.720]  about it and the things that you bring up this is very interesting everybody needs to go to
[3:53:27.720 --> 3:53:34.040]  sabral.com and read up on this s i b r e l dot com because it is it's fascinating to me to think
[3:53:34.040 --> 3:53:39.400]  about it in a different context and if you could build something right now or have a place to go
[3:53:39.400 --> 3:53:43.640]  say in the mountains or take care of your family because you knew something like this was going
[3:53:43.640 --> 3:53:46.920]  to hit it's this is the whole reason you're talking about it it's the whole reason you're
[3:53:46.920 --> 3:53:53.560]  writing about it is because people need to be prepared yeah i remember uh you asking me hey let's
[3:53:53.560 --> 3:53:58.040]  you know to tell you through my surprise you wanted to talk about planet x instead of the
[3:53:58.040 --> 3:54:02.680]  moon landing fraud which i'm known for and then i started thinking you know i think you're right
[3:54:02.680 --> 3:54:08.280]  because okay they counterfeited something they murdered people they've done that before planet
[3:54:08.280 --> 3:54:15.160]  x is a little bit more relevant just like the guy at nasa told me so in 1989 when he said yes the
[3:54:15.160 --> 3:54:20.520]  moon landings are fake but it's not as important as planet x because that is going to affect the
[3:54:20.520 --> 3:54:28.040]  whole world now if planet x a rogue planet only comes close let's say between jupiter and saturn
[3:54:28.040 --> 3:54:34.680]  which is some 600 million miles away it will pull jupiter further away from the sun which will
[3:54:34.680 --> 3:54:39.720]  pull the earth further away from the sun isa said the earth will be moved out of its place
[3:54:39.720 --> 3:54:45.960]  the orbit could even be elongated into an oval which would cause incredible climate change
[3:54:45.960 --> 3:54:51.480]  of severe winters and severe summers now another thing i found interesting is that
[3:54:51.480 --> 3:54:56.680]  when they first invented the space shuttle they were really optimistic they could launch that thing
[3:54:56.680 --> 3:55:02.040]  with you know having multiple ones in various progress twice a year they ended up launching
[3:55:02.040 --> 3:55:06.920]  them sometimes four times a year for a decade or two and i said to myself you know that's
[3:55:06.920 --> 3:55:13.720]  very dangerous and very fast they were in a hurry to build something and then they go up and they
[3:55:13.720 --> 3:55:19.480]  claim it takes three days to triangulate the docking with the space station then the soviets
[3:55:19.480 --> 3:55:23.480]  launch and they're there in 12 hours and you know what the excuse was well they have better math than
[3:55:23.480 --> 3:55:29.320]  we do i think if two plus two is four in america it equals four in russia so what they're doing
[3:55:29.320 --> 3:55:34.360]  is something else they have another space station what is that all about there's no way to stop a
[3:55:34.360 --> 3:55:40.760]  planet six times bigger than the earth but it will cause comets and asteroids and i think maybe
[3:55:40.760 --> 3:55:45.400]  what they were building is something to zap those for planet x approach
[3:55:47.320 --> 3:55:52.600]  wow interesting a lot of i hope everybody's getting a lot of food for thought especially your
[3:55:52.600 --> 3:55:56.760]  comments about prepping you know we've been prepping a long time and probably this audience i'm
[3:55:56.760 --> 3:56:01.800]  going to say um you're prepping out there you're ordering extra right um and maybe have it in a
[3:56:01.800 --> 3:56:07.880]  couple of places maybe have some place that you can go to um that has your food storage too maybe
[3:56:07.880 --> 3:56:11.240]  divvy it up a little bit there's all kinds of things i know we only have about a minute and a
[3:56:11.240 --> 3:56:16.760]  half left but there's so many things that maybe we could do maybe we can't bypass all this coming
[3:56:16.760 --> 3:56:21.400]  but maybe we can just prepare a little harder i don't know what do you think yeah i think and a
[3:56:21.400 --> 3:56:27.080]  lot of people my my wife hates the word tribulation supplies are prepared for the tribulation she
[3:56:27.080 --> 3:56:32.120]  gets tired of hearing about it one of the things she keeps reminding me of and she's right is that
[3:56:32.120 --> 3:56:37.800]  we need to be spiritually prepared because that's really more important i mean it is good if you
[3:56:37.800 --> 3:56:43.480]  want to ride it out and you know watch the show have some supplies but we need to repent you know
[3:56:43.480 --> 3:56:51.480]  jesus said to believers the love of most will grow cold in the last days and only those who hold to
[3:56:51.480 --> 3:56:57.960]  the very end will be saved once saved always saved is a false doctrine it says so in hebrus 10 if we
[3:56:57.960 --> 3:57:03.880]  deliberately go on sending no sacrifice where sin is left so we have to continue to repent continue
[3:57:03.880 --> 3:57:09.800]  to improve our character and god's grace will take care of the rest and again if your listeners
[3:57:09.800 --> 3:57:14.600]  want to see and read this you know article that took me hundreds of hours to write a research
