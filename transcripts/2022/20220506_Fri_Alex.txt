[00:00.000 --> 00:06.240]  If you had asked me all this stuff a year ago about the corruption that's going on,
[00:06.240 --> 00:07.800]  I would have said, you're crazy.
[00:07.800 --> 00:11.840]  There's no way that there could be this level of corruption in government.
[00:11.840 --> 00:18.280]  You shouldn't listen to Infowars and Bandod video because that's all nonsense and you
[00:18.280 --> 00:23.440]  know, you shouldn't pay attention to any of this stuff.
[00:23.440 --> 00:30.160]  It's been very evident to me that all of these people who are being labeled as misinformation
[00:30.160 --> 00:33.880]  spreaders, I mean, they're the guys telling the truth.
[00:33.880 --> 00:37.760]  There are many thousands of physicians who have been silenced from telling the American
[00:37.760 --> 00:42.080]  people the good news about this situation, that we can manage the virus.
[00:42.080 --> 00:46.040]  The true misinformation spreaders are the CDC and the public health officials.
[00:46.040 --> 00:49.360]  This remains a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[00:49.360 --> 00:53.040]  They are the ones that are propagating this outbreak, the only people you can blame.
[00:53.040 --> 00:54.040]  This is a shaming.
[00:54.040 --> 00:55.040]  This is the truth.
[00:55.040 --> 00:57.640]  Maybe they should be ashamed of the unvaccinated.
[00:57.640 --> 01:02.040]  This is the situation of an outbreak and a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[01:02.040 --> 01:06.560]  Dr. Fauci has probably done more good for the world than all of us in this room combined.
[01:06.560 --> 01:16.040]  Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your
[01:16.040 --> 01:21.040]  statement of May 11th where you claimed that the NIH never funded gain-of-function research
[01:21.040 --> 01:22.040]  in Wuhan?
[01:22.040 --> 01:23.040]  I totally resent that.
[01:23.040 --> 01:27.320]  And if anybody is lying here, Senator, it is you.
[01:27.320 --> 01:31.840]  We now know that Fauci-funded EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit headed by Peter
[01:31.840 --> 01:37.800]  Dazik, was absolutely engaged in gain-of-function research to make chimeric, SARS-based coronaviruses,
[01:37.800 --> 01:39.960]  which they confirmed could infect human cells.
[01:39.960 --> 01:46.320]  In the worst part, all the people going along and being lab rats for these heartless mega-corporations,
[01:46.320 --> 01:51.680]  it is truly incredible if only people had the entire story that the COVID shots are
[01:51.680 --> 01:53.840]  not conventional vaccines.
[01:53.840 --> 01:57.560]  There are plenty of examples of people that are having very serious medical conditions
[01:57.560 --> 01:59.880]  that result from the vaccination.
[01:59.880 --> 02:04.240]  When the convulsion started, I knew it had to be from the vaccine.
[02:04.240 --> 02:09.560]  Due to this vaccine, I don't even know if I'll gain a full movement and my leg back.
[02:09.560 --> 02:11.760]  One of their high school football players died.
[02:11.760 --> 02:15.620]  He had two blood clots inside his brain, another on the outside of his brain.
[02:15.620 --> 02:20.200]  The hardest thing was I let him get that shot.
[02:20.200 --> 02:23.080]  I got the vaccine.
[02:23.080 --> 02:24.080]  What?
[02:24.080 --> 02:25.080]  What is this?
[02:25.080 --> 02:26.080]  What is this?
[02:26.080 --> 02:27.080]  Please, please help me.
[02:27.080 --> 02:28.080]  We need help.
[02:28.080 --> 02:29.080]  We need help.
[02:29.080 --> 02:30.080]  Help.
[02:30.080 --> 02:31.080]  Help.
[02:31.080 --> 02:32.080]  Help.
[02:32.080 --> 02:33.080]  Help.
[02:33.080 --> 02:34.080]  Help.
[02:34.080 --> 02:35.080]  Help.
[02:35.080 --> 02:36.080]  Help.
[02:36.080 --> 02:37.080]  Help.
[02:37.080 --> 02:38.080]  Help.
[02:38.080 --> 02:39.080]  Help.
[02:39.080 --> 02:40.080]  Help.
[02:40.080 --> 02:41.080]  Help.
[02:41.080 --> 02:42.080]  Help.
[02:42.080 --> 02:43.080]  Help.
[02:43.080 --> 02:44.080]  Help.
[02:44.080 --> 02:45.080]  Help.
[02:45.080 --> 02:46.080]  Help.
[02:46.080 --> 02:47.080]  Help.
[02:47.080 --> 02:48.080]  Help.
[02:48.080 --> 02:49.080]  Help.
[02:49.080 --> 02:50.080]  Help.
[02:50.080 --> 02:56.080]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[02:56.080 --> 03:03.880]  The Left have wised up to this. If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it.
[03:03.880 --> 03:05.880]  The social media giants, and they are.
[03:05.880 --> 03:11.680]  For many on the Left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[03:11.680 --> 03:16.480]  So far, the most prominent casualty of the Crusade Against Free Expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[03:16.480 --> 03:24.280]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations in Big Tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[03:24.280 --> 03:30.280]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[03:30.280 --> 03:37.280]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[03:37.280 --> 03:46.280]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead a tap dogging calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press,
[03:46.280 --> 03:47.280]  working with Big Tech.
[03:47.280 --> 03:50.280]  People know what's true. They can smell it.
[03:50.280 --> 03:55.280]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:55.280 --> 04:17.280]  In a free country, everyone can be heard. In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be heard.
[04:17.280 --> 04:32.280]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[04:32.280 --> 04:40.280]  The great awakening is here. Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[04:40.280 --> 04:50.280]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[05:11.280 --> 05:20.280]  And most iodine that you get from different foods is bound to other minerals or other compounds so it's not absorbable in the body.
[05:20.280 --> 05:22.280]  And that's why iodine deficiency is such a huge issue.
[05:22.280 --> 05:28.280]  We have the purest, cleanest, best iodine in the world from deep-reth crystals more than 7,000 feet deep.
[05:28.280 --> 05:32.280]  X2 is an amazing product and it has been sold out for months and months and months.
[05:32.280 --> 05:37.280]  It is now back in stock at infowarstore.com for 25% off.
[05:37.280 --> 05:42.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, with all the supply chain breakdowns and the rest of it, I'm not sure when the next time we're going to get X2 is.
[05:42.280 --> 05:49.280]  So I would stock up on X2 right now at infowarstore.com and know that you're funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[05:49.280 --> 05:57.280]  That's a 360 win. You're healthier, you have a better immune system, a better focus, better clarity and you're funding the info war.
[05:57.280 --> 06:08.280]  Please visit infowarstore.com and get your X2 today.
[06:27.280 --> 06:43.280]  It's Friday, May 6th, the year is 2022. Thank you so much for joining us.
[06:43.280 --> 06:54.280]  Alright, I intend to open the phones up for several hours of the broadcast today and I intend to cover the entire waterfront of incredible news, but here is the bottom line.
[06:54.280 --> 07:07.280]  America is fighting for its soul right now over this infanticide abortion baby harvesting nightmare.
[07:07.280 --> 07:22.280]  We have massive news on that front where the left announced two days ago they would start storming churches and pro-life centers and stalking and harassing members of the federal judiciary in D.C.
[07:22.280 --> 07:26.280]  and other areas that do not submit to their tyranny.
[07:26.280 --> 07:42.280]  This is clearly a racketeering terrorist operation, but they are fully protected by the head racketeer terrorist minion, globalist puppet, but still he is the president in function.
[07:42.280 --> 07:53.280]  And that of course is Barack Obama enjoying his third term right now with a placeholder, placeholders known as Biden and Harris.
[07:53.280 --> 08:02.280]  Godless Pro-Abortion activists announced plans to storm Catholic churches, interrupt mass on Mother's Day this weekend. They hate motherhood, they hate family.
[08:02.280 --> 08:10.280]  Report, Antifa attacks a crisis pregnancy center in Portland, ransacks it, breaks out the windows.
[08:10.280 --> 08:19.280]  Leftist direct protesters to intimidate conservative Supreme Court justice at their homes and the White House Press Secretary defends it and says it's a good idea.
[08:19.280 --> 08:28.280]  And says the criminal leaking of the Supreme Court draft ruling is also a good thing.
[08:28.280 --> 08:41.280]  Now leftist asks if someone should kill conservative members of the Supreme Court over Roe v. Wade. Don't expect any investigation.
[08:41.280 --> 08:54.280]  Again it's BLM, Soros funded groups targeting members of the Supreme Court's homes offering money to the activists, bounties.
[08:54.280 --> 08:58.280]  We'll be going through this, we plan the clips, that's in the stack.
[08:58.280 --> 09:05.280]  Then we have a very important stack on the whole COVID tyranny.
[09:05.280 --> 09:18.280]  It's in the SPARS 2025-2028 war game document that is really a blueprint for what they carried out with COVID for the year 2020-2023.
[09:18.280 --> 09:26.280]  And in there we shot a report over a year ago titled SPARS 2023-2025-2028.
[09:26.280 --> 09:34.280]  It's got about 4 million views on Bandai Video that you should go watch because it's more important now than it was even then.
[09:34.280 --> 09:43.280]  People like General Flynn saw the document and he was blown away because the military will do war games but those are actually operational war plans as well.
[09:43.280 --> 09:49.280]  So a war game is a practice of an off the shelf attack you're going to run.
[09:49.280 --> 10:00.280]  And in it they talk about how when it comes out that the shot's going to cause blood clots, heart attacks, brain damage, infertility, autoimmune disorders that are AIDS like.
[10:00.280 --> 10:07.280]  That they will put little announcements out that they cycle on and off to look out, to watch out.
[10:07.280 --> 10:18.280]  And it'll be published as like public warnings but not widely disseminated and then that way later when it all comes out they'll just say well it's plausible to not ability, nobody made you take it.
[10:18.280 --> 10:25.280]  There's the report, Emergency Saturday Broadcast World Shocked by SPARS 2025-2028 document.
[10:25.280 --> 10:30.280]  It's got 3.6 million views in that version, another million views, another version on Bandai Video.
[10:30.280 --> 10:35.280]  The point is 3.6 or 4.6 million views is not enough.
[10:35.280 --> 10:43.280]  I'm going to have it reposted under the live show feed today so it'll be easier for you to find and share.
[10:43.280 --> 10:47.280]  And so what we saw in the SPARS document is now here unfolding in front of us.
[10:47.280 --> 10:57.280]  FDA limits J&J COVID-19 vaccine over blood clot risk even though all the other ones do the exact same thing.
[10:57.280 --> 11:22.280]  Now the J&J is a virus vector vaccine or a spliced clone DNA virus, RNA mixture of a chimpanzee and a dead human child are fired into the nucleus of the cell and then it orders the cell to produce the deadly spike protein.
[11:22.280 --> 11:28.280]  That's why statistics show the shots are worse than actually getting COVID and basically give you the same thing.
[11:28.280 --> 11:31.280]  And they do so many other things as well.
[11:31.280 --> 11:40.280]  But it causes so many disorders in their studies of rats and other animals that's why they went with it because it's then hard to pin down exactly what's going on.
[11:40.280 --> 11:45.280]  But they knew in their own CDC documents in October 2020 what would happen months before they rolled it out.
[11:45.280 --> 11:49.280]  Well now the FDA limits J&J COVID-19 vaccine over blood clot risk.
[11:49.280 --> 11:57.280]  You know if you kind of tell people that two years ago, they were even starting secret trials that was doing that, they would ban you off Twitter or Facebook.
[11:57.280 --> 12:01.280]  But here it is, they now admit it will be going over all of that.
[12:01.280 --> 12:11.280]  Pfizer's new 80,000 page data dump under court order is a nightmare and came at the same time as the Roe v. Wade leak will be going over what's in those new documents.
[12:11.280 --> 12:15.280]  And really the biggest news of the day and then I'll get into all the rest of it.
[12:15.280 --> 12:22.280]  Gates and all his minions and cohorts are openly having a UN corporate takeover of all medical systems in the world.
[12:22.280 --> 12:26.280]  And a world medical ID, the basis of the world, cashless society programmable.
[12:26.280 --> 12:36.280]  Token, Mark of the Beast, cashless society system that brings in the social credit score, carbon tax in their own words.
[12:36.280 --> 12:42.280]  Well now he's making the rounds, he's crawled off from under his rock saying creating the germ team, a corporate UN body,
[12:42.280 --> 12:46.280]  is the single most important thing we can do to prevent the next pandemic.
[12:46.280 --> 12:53.280]  And the UN has basically announced it's now under Bilderberg Group Davos Group Command yesterday.
[12:53.280 --> 13:00.280]  And Bill Gates promises there'll be no more pandemics because there won't be any more people when they are done.
[13:00.280 --> 13:04.280]  This is the cover for their economic collapse and takeover.
[13:04.280 --> 13:12.280]  We'll be getting to all of it coming up today and folks are battling back against it all over the world.
[13:12.280 --> 13:19.280]  Also in New Zealand, they caught a bunch of theater where the Prime Minister and others, dozens of more wearing masks.
[13:19.280 --> 13:25.280]  But before they go on the stage, they put their mask on and then they take their mask off.
[13:25.280 --> 13:27.280]  It's all for complete theater.
[13:27.280 --> 13:29.280]  She even says go ahead and put your mask on.
[13:29.280 --> 13:33.280]  We're about to go on camera and they don't even care that other cameras are capturing it.
[13:33.280 --> 13:37.280]  There's similar footage of this in California and Pennsylvania and D.C.
[13:37.280 --> 13:40.280]  with the politicians doing the same damn thing.
[13:40.280 --> 13:45.280]  They follow a battle plan script.
[13:45.280 --> 13:48.280]  Meanwhile, you look at this, you think, well, these are just cooks.
[13:48.280 --> 13:49.280]  Nobody's gonna listen to them.
[13:49.280 --> 13:55.280]  No, whatever they put out is what the Tabastock Institute and the Davos Group, the Carnegie Endowment want.
[13:55.280 --> 13:59.280]  Transgender activists make argument for all children to be put on puberty blockers
[13:59.280 --> 14:04.280]  to determine their identity, talk about mass sterilization, mass evil, mass drugging.
[14:04.280 --> 14:12.280]  That is, it's not enough the plastics and chemicals and the food and water to hemathradize the general population
[14:12.280 --> 14:17.280]  and cause all these mutations and serious medical issues.
[14:17.280 --> 14:19.280]  Now they want to openly and directly do it.
[14:19.280 --> 14:26.280]  They're also in the news calling to put lithium forcibly in the water to make you behave and have a happier society.
[14:26.280 --> 14:30.280]  An anti-psychotic metal.
[14:30.280 --> 14:32.280]  So that's what we've got on that front.
[14:32.280 --> 14:36.280]  We've got the leftist, more footage of them melting down of their sacrament of abortion.
[14:36.280 --> 14:38.280]  People not want to go along with it.
[14:38.280 --> 14:39.280]  It's all coming up today.
[14:39.280 --> 14:45.280]  But make no mistake, Info Wars is dreaded by tyrants and pedophiles and Satanists
[14:45.280 --> 14:47.280]  and control freak predators everywhere.
[14:47.280 --> 14:54.280]  And when you share the articles from infowars.com or newswars.com, isn't it banned?
[14:54.280 --> 14:57.280]  Or from Bandot Video, the link to use from Bandot Video.
[14:57.280 --> 15:00.280]  They haven't restricted yet on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and other places.
[15:00.280 --> 15:05.280]  It's battleplan.news, battleplan.news.
[15:05.280 --> 15:07.280]  When you do that, you're changing the world.
[15:07.280 --> 15:09.280]  We're so close to tipping point.
[15:09.280 --> 15:12.280]  We're so close to beating these globalists.
[15:12.280 --> 15:16.280]  We are so incredibly close to winning.
[15:16.280 --> 15:19.280]  And instead of just hoping Congress reverses all this censorship,
[15:19.280 --> 15:23.280]  we have to override it by the sheer force of your action and your will.
[15:23.280 --> 15:25.280]  And it's so simple.
[15:25.280 --> 15:29.280]  If you just put infowars.com on the back of business cards or on the back of pieces of paper
[15:29.280 --> 15:32.280]  and hand them out and say, find out the truth, find out what you're not supposed to know.
[15:32.280 --> 15:35.280]  If you just share the articles and videos, we have the most important,
[15:35.280 --> 15:38.280]  hardcore, effective truth out there and it needs to be spread.
[15:38.280 --> 15:40.280]  And I know you're doing it.
[15:40.280 --> 15:42.280]  You're the tip of the spear and I salute you and thank you.

[17:44.280 --> 17:49.280]  But right now, infowars.com, Ford slash crypto, the real revolution is happening now.
[17:49.280 --> 17:57.280]  infowars.com, Ford slash crypto and all of you that donated, we salute you and thank you.
[18:19.280 --> 18:25.280]  That is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[18:25.280 --> 18:28.280]  We used to sell for $40, we're selling them for $15, selling them for $20.
[18:28.280 --> 18:34.280]  Whatever the shirt costs us, if a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5 for us to actually produce.
[18:34.280 --> 18:36.280]  It costs $10, we're selling them for $10.
[18:36.280 --> 18:39.280]  And we've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves and we've got short sleeves.
[18:39.280 --> 18:43.280]  We've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all and they're limited edition
[18:43.280 --> 18:46.280]  because we're never going to make any of these designs.
[18:46.280 --> 18:52.280]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[18:52.280 --> 18:57.280]  We've got to sell this to keep infowars on the air plus it spreads the word infowars.com.
[18:57.280 --> 19:00.280]  Here historic apparel now infowars.com.
[19:00.280 --> 19:02.280]  So I did it.
[19:02.280 --> 19:04.280]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[19:04.280 --> 19:11.280]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com.
[19:11.280 --> 19:17.280]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going.
[19:17.280 --> 19:24.280]  You know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy
[19:24.280 --> 19:30.280]  and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[19:30.280 --> 19:34.280]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis.
[19:34.280 --> 19:35.280]  I have bad joints.
[19:35.280 --> 19:36.280]  Thanks mom.
[19:36.280 --> 19:43.280]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[19:43.280 --> 19:48.280]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[19:48.280 --> 19:56.280]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day
[19:56.280 --> 20:00.280]  and Sorilis can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[20:00.280 --> 20:07.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:15.280 --> 20:23.280]  Amazingly today we do not have a large global organization dedicated to preventing pandemics.
[20:23.280 --> 20:33.280]  There are some part-time efforts. The WHO helps the world with lots of health issues, but it hasn't been given the resources to have this dedicated team.
[20:33.280 --> 20:39.280]  We need to create this group with full-time paid experts who are constantly tracking disease outbreaks.
[20:39.280 --> 20:44.280]  I call this the global epidemic response and mobilization team.
[20:44.280 --> 20:46.280]  So the acronym is GERM.
[20:46.280 --> 20:51.280]  The GERM team will actively monitor potential health threats all over the world.
[20:51.280 --> 20:56.280]  Data scientists would see where there are clusters of suspicious cases.
[20:56.280 --> 21:04.280]  Epidemiologists would monitor reports from national governments to identify anything that could be an outbreak.
[21:04.280 --> 21:09.280]  We'll have disease modelers gathering the data to do accurate projections.
[21:09.280 --> 21:13.280]  Product development experts will work with governments and companies.
[21:13.280 --> 21:22.280]  We need more work on diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines that we can scale up with very short notice.
[21:22.280 --> 21:28.280]  And we'll have policy experts making sure that every country has the right approach.
[21:28.280 --> 21:33.280]  The team will need to regularly organize outbreak simulations.
[21:33.280 --> 21:38.280]  GERM games that test the global response system and finds the weak spots.
[21:38.280 --> 21:43.280]  We do that for war, we do that for fire, we do that for earthquakes.
[21:43.280 --> 21:46.280]  And now we need to make sure we do it for pandemics.
[21:46.280 --> 21:52.280]  This team would keep their skills fresh to help me get rid of polio, get rid of malaria,
[21:52.280 --> 21:55.280]  get rid of measles and other infectious diseases.
[21:55.280 --> 22:01.280]  So they'll have immense value even in the years where we don't have a pandemic threat.
[22:01.280 --> 22:08.280]  It's a critical step to build this GERM team, making sure we're ready for the next pandemic.
[22:12.280 --> 22:20.280]  Everyone should watch that one minute 45 second clip over and over and over again.
[22:20.280 --> 22:25.280]  I'm going to have it posted in the live show feed area beneath the main broadcast today.
[22:25.280 --> 22:27.280]  But let's walk through it.
[22:27.280 --> 22:32.280]  In that minute 45 seconds, he hits everything.
[22:32.280 --> 22:35.280]  We're going to have a permanent UN World Government System,
[22:35.280 --> 22:38.280]  which they've got the treaties going with right now unfolding.
[22:38.280 --> 22:44.280]  We're going to have the surveillance system over your phones and then chips in your clothes and body.
[22:44.280 --> 22:46.280]  They've announced all that.
[22:46.280 --> 22:49.280]  The tracks everywhere you go in the name of stopping the pandemic.
[22:49.280 --> 22:52.280]  They're going to continue to develop the new viruses and release them.
[22:52.280 --> 22:59.280]  And then beta test stronger and stronger viruses and stronger and stronger quote vaccines they're going to give you
[22:59.280 --> 23:03.280]  while spinning the whole thing that they're trying to protect you while they do it.
[23:03.280 --> 23:08.280]  This is how they're bringing in the casual society, the carbon tax, the social credit score.
[23:08.280 --> 23:11.280]  It's all admitted by the Debo Scroop.
[23:11.280 --> 23:16.280]  And here's Gates pushing this merger of corporations that quote work with the UN
[23:16.280 --> 23:24.280]  and the stew and powered world body germ to then come up with the treatments
[23:24.280 --> 23:28.280]  that the corporations are then paid taxpayer money with.
[23:28.280 --> 23:32.280]  They can solidate the money and power while tracking controlling you while making everybody else
[23:32.280 --> 23:37.280]  non-essential while training you to be locked down on a routine basis under a technocracy.
[23:37.280 --> 23:40.280]  This is absolute hell on earth.
[23:40.280 --> 23:46.280]  And remember Bill Gates, Peter Dazik, Anthony Fauci are all on record.
[23:46.280 --> 23:48.280]  It's all there.
[23:48.280 --> 23:50.280]  The emails have been released.
[23:50.280 --> 23:55.280]  It's all come out of EcoHealth Alliance and all of it and Obama going back to 2012.
[23:55.280 --> 24:02.280]  And it was going on before that but it accelerated creating viruses described as COVID-19
[24:02.280 --> 24:04.280]  with the exact same sequences and combinations.
[24:04.280 --> 24:06.280]  It was made in a lab.
[24:06.280 --> 24:08.280]  It was made in the United States.
[24:08.280 --> 24:17.280]  It was transferred to China for plausible deniability six months before the release publicly.
[24:17.280 --> 24:20.280]  They approached the Pentagon and said we'd like to open air releases in China.
[24:20.280 --> 24:23.280]  We now know they did it years before in 2017.
[24:23.280 --> 24:29.280]  That's how Michael Flynn, General Flynn learned about that when he was at the Defense Intelligence Agency
[24:29.280 --> 24:33.280]  and then as the head national security advisor.
[24:33.280 --> 24:37.280]  That's why he wouldn't release classified info on air but he would just say I'm telling you it was made in a lab.
[24:37.280 --> 24:39.280]  It's synthetic nanotech virus.
[24:39.280 --> 24:41.280]  And then we got the documents.
[24:41.280 --> 24:46.280]  It's synthetic nanotech headline London Telegraph.
[24:46.280 --> 24:57.280]  Synthetic virus particles penetrate human skin with spars COVID chimeric viruses.
[24:57.280 --> 25:02.280]  And so when Gates Chillingly has been making the rounds the last week,
[25:02.280 --> 25:08.280]  whenever he comes out of his spider hole, better look out because he wants to telegraph and tell you what he's about to do.
[25:08.280 --> 25:18.280]  So he'll be called a hero when everything he talked about comes true because he and others that he represents are behind it.
[25:18.280 --> 25:23.280]  This is a life and death situation.
[25:23.280 --> 25:26.280]  This is all on record and we need legislatures.
[25:26.280 --> 25:27.280]  We need governors.
[25:27.280 --> 25:29.280]  We need citizens and lawsuits.
[25:29.280 --> 25:30.280]  We need courts.
[25:30.280 --> 25:31.280]  We need Congress.
[25:31.280 --> 25:32.280]  We need whistleblowers.
[25:32.280 --> 25:40.280]  We need people to realize this is front and center of their takeover.
[25:40.280 --> 25:50.280]  They are on record saying there are too many people on the planet and that they're going to call us.
[25:50.280 --> 25:53.280]  Remember, General Stubblebine was the head of the army.
[25:53.280 --> 25:57.280]  His wife was a high level medical doctor.
[25:57.280 --> 26:04.280]  And they were told in the early 2000s, 2005, well, she was treating the head of state,
[26:04.280 --> 26:09.280]  the head of state that the mass culling with a controlled viral release was coming,
[26:09.280 --> 26:13.280]  but then it would be the vaccine would actually erase people's immune systems after that,
[26:13.280 --> 26:14.280]  getting everybody for the next attack.
[26:14.280 --> 26:25.280]  That's all word for word in Jesse Ventura's first season that I helped do the research for at least two of the episodes.
[26:25.280 --> 26:27.280]  The two episodes are 90% my research.
[26:27.280 --> 26:28.280]  The others are partially my research.
[26:28.280 --> 26:30.280]  The point is, I brought him Labo.
[26:30.280 --> 26:31.280]  I brought him the documents.
[26:31.280 --> 26:33.280]  And it's not about credit.
[26:33.280 --> 26:35.280]  It's about I knew who to bring to him.
[26:35.280 --> 26:41.280]  And that's why those shows are so powerful and so viral today is because word for word,
[26:41.280 --> 26:43.280]  what she says is true.
[26:43.280 --> 26:45.280]  Who do you think she is?
[26:45.280 --> 26:53.280]  She's a top medical doctor, the wife of the guy that ran not just the army's secret operations,
[26:53.280 --> 27:01.280]  but who ran the CIA's secret operations and what came after MKUltra.
[27:01.280 --> 27:06.280]  Now, they believed they were doing that to make America stronger and defeat foreign enemies,
[27:06.280 --> 27:09.280]  but they later realized that it was bad.
[27:09.280 --> 27:11.280]  Look up Stubblebine.
[27:11.280 --> 27:17.280]  They turned into a cartoon, a joke with John Ronson's fraudulent book.
[27:17.280 --> 27:19.280]  Everything he does is a fraud, in my view.
[27:19.280 --> 27:28.280]  Men who stare at goats, but that makes a joke with Jeff Bridges and others in it about what Stubblebine was really doing.
[27:28.280 --> 27:38.280]  But those projects they were doing that are in that movie is just a very, very, very, very, very small part of the projects they were involved in.
[27:38.280 --> 27:39.280]  So I'm going to say it again.
[27:39.280 --> 27:41.280]  People ask how I know all this stuff.
[27:41.280 --> 27:45.280]  It's on record how I know all this information.
[27:45.280 --> 27:48.280]  You can learn this information.
[27:48.280 --> 27:51.280]  You can stop this information.
[27:51.280 --> 27:54.280]  They say in the Spars document that it's a battle plan.
[27:54.280 --> 27:57.280]  You can't walk around the battle plan admitting it's a battle plan.
[27:57.280 --> 27:58.280]  So you just change the dates.
[27:58.280 --> 28:00.280]  It's got the tweets and everything.
[28:00.280 --> 28:06.280]  And when you flip the tweets, all of them, the acronyms and things, it says COVID-19.
[28:06.280 --> 28:07.280]  It says all the response.
[28:07.280 --> 28:09.280]  And then the sub headlines are exactly the same.
[28:09.280 --> 28:14.280]  They even war-gamed out what the agencies in Bill Gates would tweet.
[28:14.280 --> 28:24.280]  This was several years before they released the virus in late 2019, an exact battle plan day by day.
[28:24.280 --> 28:32.280]  And they announced going into the third year that they'll start admitting heart attacks and strokes and blood clots and say it's an accident.
[28:32.280 --> 28:38.280]  And now, FDA limits J&J COVID vaccine over blood clot risk.
[28:38.280 --> 28:47.280]  It's all been war-gamed out and we sit here like fools when we have their war game and know what they're going to do next.
[28:47.280 --> 28:49.280]  And we just take it like we're morons.
[28:49.280 --> 28:53.280]  And then other people go, man, Jones is so smart. How does he know all this?
[28:53.280 --> 28:58.280]  These freaking criminals are doing this out in the open, people.
[28:58.280 --> 29:09.280]  The UN estimates that over 2 billion people alive on Earth today have cognitive disabilities, lower IQs, and so many other medical issues because of one thing, iodine deficiency.
[29:09.280 --> 29:18.280]  And most iodine that you get from different foods is bound to other minerals or other compounds, so it's not absorbable in the body.
[29:18.280 --> 29:20.280]  And that's why iodine deficiency is such a huge issue.
[29:20.280 --> 29:30.280]  We have the purest, cleanest, best iodine in the world from deep-reth crystals more than 7,000 feet deep. X2 is an amazing product and it has been sold out for months and months and months.
[29:30.280 --> 29:35.280]  It is now back in stock at mfoldwarstore.com for 25% off.
[29:35.280 --> 29:40.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, with all the supply chain breakdowns and the rest of it, I'm not sure when the next time we're going to get X2 is.
[29:40.280 --> 29:47.280]  So I would stock up on X2 right now at mfoldwarstore.com and know that you're funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[29:47.280 --> 29:49.280]  That's a 360 win.

[30:06.280 --> 30:07.280]  These are real classics.

[30:12.280 --> 30:18.280]  They're about to be history and we're selling out of the hoodies, the ball caps, the t-shirts, all these amazing designs.
[30:18.280 --> 30:20.280]  At cost at mfoldwarstore.com.

[30:46.280 --> 30:49.280]  Exclusively available at mfoldwarstore.com.
[30:49.280 --> 30:52.280]  And again, this shirt is limited edition as well.

[1:04:58.280 --> 1:05:10.280]  You see this? It's an Info Wars Republic Defense Card with original Info Wars art designed by yours truly, with a little gold bar implanted in it, and on the back it's got a hologram.
[1:05:10.280 --> 1:05:14.280]  There are only 25,000 of these in existence, and they'll never be made again.
[1:05:14.280 --> 1:05:25.280]  The bank that owns the Mint that has started putting these out the last few years just sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling these for.
[1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:29.280]  And when you get three or more, you can get these at 50% off and they fund the Info War.

[1:06:22.280 --> 1:06:29.280]  We are now into hour number two on this May 6 Friday broadcast.
[1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:35.280]  I'm going to go to your phone calls during this segment. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:39.280]  Look, I'm going to go back to what I said last time. I'm just saying it again.
[1:06:39.280 --> 1:06:59.280]  If you knew there was a plan to use viruses for fear to lock civilization down and bring in a casual society control grid, a term I coined 20 years ago, and you knew they were going to carry it out, what would you do?
[1:06:59.280 --> 1:07:13.280]  And again, I want to explain something. I wear a journalist hat, normally just a pundit analysis hat, but wearing a journalist hat when I have met with people in private, those meetings are private, and that's why more of those meetings have happened.
[1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:31.280]  I have met with at least three members of the Bilderberg group. I have met with intelligence agency heads of this government.
[1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:53.280]  I have gone through the process of having them try to buy me off 20 years ago, and 12 years ago, and 10 years ago, and five years ago, and two years ago, and I've not sold out to them.
[1:07:53.280 --> 1:08:17.280]  But it is very frustrating to be speaking to you with a completely level head, covering things that are on the record happening, and that are going to happen, and to have it even debatable.
[1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:29.280]  And then to see all the mercenaries in thousands of corporate publications and TV programs lying and attacking this broadcast, pretending like none of this is going on.
[1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:34.280]  So I'm going to hit some news and go to your calls, but I'm going to just say it again to everybody.
[1:08:34.280 --> 1:08:51.280]  And I want to sink into myself as well. The globalists have executed 95% of their Agenda 21 program that was to be completed by the year 2021 on paper. They admitted all this.
[1:08:51.280 --> 1:09:09.280]  The next nine years will end free civilization and kill the majority of people on this planet in their own admissions.
[1:09:09.280 --> 1:09:19.280]  I morally cannot sell out to these people, even though it would give me some protection for at least a season.
[1:09:19.280 --> 1:09:24.280]  I don't want to go to prison. I don't want to be attacked by these people and their lawyers.
[1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:32.280]  But at the same time, that cost is nothing compared to being involved with what they're doing and how evil it is.
[1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:35.280]  So I don't have a choice but to do the right thing.
[1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:46.280]  And I want you guys to realize that when you call into the shows, I'm going to go to your calls and thank me that it's obscene.
[1:09:46.280 --> 1:09:52.280]  And I mean that in a nice way. You're supposed to fight this. You're supposed to resist this.
[1:09:52.280 --> 1:10:00.280]  It's not like it's nice when you're a father or a mother to get up and feed your baby at midnight or change their diaper. You're supposed to do that.
[1:10:00.280 --> 1:10:04.280]  When you see somebody have a really bad car wreck and you're a middle of nowhere, you're supposed to pull over and render aid.
[1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:09.280]  You're not a hero when you pull over and render aid.
[1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:19.280]  When you see somebody choking, you're supposed to perform the Heimlich maneuver. You're not a hero when you do it.
[1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:29.280]  And it is not a question of if you need to be activist and engaged. It's a question of do you want to be on the right side of this?
[1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:37.280]  Because if you do not oppose this evil and if you do not fight this evil, you are not neutral. There is no neutrality.
[1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:49.280]  It's like the Rush song. If you choose not to choose, you still have made a choice.
[1:10:49.280 --> 1:10:59.280]  If you choose not to choose, you still have made a choice. Please, I'm begging you.
[1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:07.280]  I don't want to be right in eight years about this.
[1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:12.280]  Now, let me tell you the good news and I'll hit the news.
[1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:19.280]  When I've had the globalists reach out and in some cases meet in person, they were very arrogant before.
[1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:23.280]  They were laughing at me when I didn't join them.
[1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:31.280]  Now, when I met with individuals the highest levels of the system, they say, how do we get out of this? You're right. It's going to destroy everybody.
[1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:36.280]  This isn't good.
[1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:49.280]  And so even individuals at the highest levels of the power structure now realize that this system is going down and falling and that they'll never survive what's happening.
[1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:54.280]  And that's why you see what Elon Musk is doing.
[1:11:54.280 --> 1:12:04.280]  It's like in V for Vendetta when he finally meets with the police inspector, you know, the head detective.
[1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:11.280]  And the inspector, he tells him how the government released a bio weapon for fear and bio medical tyranny state to control everybody.
[1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:17.280]  What we're now living under. We're telling you what they would do beforehand.
[1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:26.280]  He looks at V who he hasn't figured out as V yet in his disguise and he says, why didn't you do something before?
[1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:35.280]  Why didn't you stop this if you knew this in V looks at him and he says, I was waiting for you inspector.
[1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:38.280]  I was waiting for you.
[1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:43.280]  And that's the same thing when you call in and thank me.
[1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:47.280]  I'm asking you to take action. I'm just like you. I just learned this earlier.
[1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:52.280]  I can't do this without you. You're just as important or more important than I am.
[1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:58.280]  That's why V looks at me as inspector.
[1:12:58.280 --> 1:13:02.280]  I was waiting for you.
[1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:07.280]  I was waiting for you.
[1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:20.280]  I mean, do you understand that all the food shortages and the collapse and everything you've seen being set up is just the beta test for their main move?
[1:13:20.280 --> 1:13:36.280]  Do you understand that? I mean, just as sure as the sun rose this morning, they are making a move to implode civilization, cause mass collapse and mass death on a scale never before seen.
[1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:51.280]  And I am completely energized in every cell in my body to stop these people, but I cannot do it without you.
[1:13:51.280 --> 1:14:10.280]  I need all of you, including my amazing crew, who is absolutely aligned and doing a great job to understand that we don't have time to screw around now.
[1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:19.280]  And we may have failed in stopping them launching their main operation, but they've done it in a badly coordinated, damaged way and they admit they're in trouble.
[1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:25.280]  And so now we've got to stop them.
[1:14:25.280 --> 1:14:44.280]  So I could talk about the window dressing all day, but when you realize the transhumanist power-tripping satanic goal of the New World Order and you realize you have nothing left to lose but taking action, then the question is how do we take action?
[1:14:44.280 --> 1:15:01.280]  And I'm going to do pieces on that, my best thoughts, we're going to do a lot of shows in the future where I'll do three, four hours of calls just on solutions, because you have great ideas where we can all war game how to peacefully stand up and do the right thing and not be set up in a false flag,
[1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:12.280]  and how to go to city councils and county commissioner meetings, and how to go to churches and speak, and how to the street corners, it doesn't matter.
[1:15:12.280 --> 1:15:18.280]  But how every little bit counts and how we're going to raise the alarm and save humanity together with God.
[1:15:18.280 --> 1:15:33.280]  All right, we got loaded phone lines with Jordan and Chris and Harve and Bruce and Robert and Scott and Kyle and Winston and Russell and Alex, and I'll take every one of those calls and more today, and then we'll get to all this other news.
[1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:48.280]  But the New World Order is a suicide pack. The New World Order is a deal with death. The New World Order is a delusion. It's a lie and it's got to be rejected. When you swallow poison, you got to vomit it out.
[1:15:48.280 --> 1:16:04.280]  We'll be right back. Infowars.com, the tip of the spear.

[1:17:57.280 --> 1:18:12.280]  We've designed over 200 t-shirts the last 25 years. And we have some of those original designs still for sale at infowars.com. These are real classics. But ladies and gentlemen, they're all about to be limited edition because we're selling out of them.
[1:18:12.280 --> 1:18:20.280]  They're about to be history and we're selling out of the hoodies, the ball caps, the t-shirts, all these amazing designs at cost infowars.com.
[1:18:20.280 --> 1:18:30.280]  They're this fundraiser shirt that is a real hit and people love it. It's $24.95. Alex Jones is right on the front, the Red Thunderbolt, and again, on the back, a big bold infowars.com.
[1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:38.280]  Exercise your First Amendment. Don't let the leftist and the globalist bully silence you and fund the info war at the same time.
[1:18:38.280 --> 1:18:48.280]  There is not a more politically incorrect shirt that sends a stronger message of freedom, resistance to the New World Order than the Alex Jones was right shirt, exclusively available at infowarsstore.com.
[1:18:48.280 --> 1:18:57.280]  And again, this shirt is limited edition as well. We're doing one more run and then no more infowarsstore.com. Get yours today.
[1:18:57.280 --> 1:19:06.280]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand info wars. I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:11.280]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films. I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[1:19:11.280 --> 1:19:20.280]  And it was a t-shirt I designed the first one. Mass murderers agree gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew.
[1:19:20.280 --> 1:19:29.280]  That's our oldest design and we're still selling. We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions because whatever stock we've got in, that's it.
[1:19:29.280 --> 1:19:35.280]  We're selling everything out to fund the operation to get rid of inventory. We'll still have some teachers in the future.
[1:19:35.280 --> 1:19:41.280]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs. So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[1:19:41.280 --> 1:20:07.280]  I almost forgot. We're selling them all at cost at infowarsstore.com. Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts, they're all selling at cost infowarsstore.com.
[1:20:07.280 --> 1:20:35.280]  From the front lines of the information ward, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:35.280 --> 1:20:40.280]  He came in the hour and took any of the collie bubbles.
[1:20:40.280 --> 1:20:52.280]  Still does.
[1:20:52.280 --> 1:20:56.280]  That's close enough, Inspector.
[1:20:56.280 --> 1:20:58.280]  We're not wired.
[1:20:58.280 --> 1:21:02.280]  I'm sorry but a man in my position survives by taking every precaution.
[1:21:02.280 --> 1:21:03.280]  You've information for us?
[1:21:03.280 --> 1:21:10.280]  No, you already have the information. All the names and dates are inside your head. What you want, what you really need is a story.
[1:21:10.280 --> 1:21:12.280]  A story can be true or false.
[1:21:12.280 --> 1:21:16.280]  I leave such judgments to you, Inspector.
[1:21:16.280 --> 1:21:23.280]  Our story begins, as these stories often do, with a young, up-and-coming politician.
[1:21:23.280 --> 1:21:38.280]  He's a deeply religious man and a member of the Conservative Party. He's completely single-minded and has no regard for the political process. The more power he attains, the more obvious his zealotry and the more aggressiveness supporters become.
[1:21:38.280 --> 1:21:44.280]  Eventually, his party launches a special project in the name of national security.
[1:21:44.280 --> 1:21:50.280]  At first, it's believed to be a search for biological weapons, and it's pursued without regard to its cost.
[1:21:50.280 --> 1:21:57.280]  However, the true goal of this project is power, complete in total hegemonic domination.
[1:21:57.280 --> 1:22:01.280]  The project, however, ends violently.
[1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:09.280]  But the efforts of those involved are not in vain, and a new ability to wage war is born from the blood of one of the victims.
[1:22:09.280 --> 1:22:21.280]  Imagine a virus, the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you and you alone have the cure. But if your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such a weapon?
[1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:25.280]  Let's out this point in our story that along comes a spider.
[1:22:25.280 --> 1:22:36.280]  He is a man seemingly without a conscience, for whom the ends always justify the means, and it is he who suggests that their target should not be an enemy of the country, but rather the country itself.
[1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:45.280]  Three targets are chosen to maximize the effect of the attack. A school, a tube station, and a water treatment plant. Several hundred die within the first few weeks.
[1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:47.280]  That three waters has, in fact, been contaminated.
[1:22:47.280 --> 1:22:50.280]  Authorities are attempting to control its deadly spread.
[1:22:50.280 --> 1:22:53.280]  Set a wave of destruction throughout the underground.
[1:22:53.280 --> 1:23:02.280]  Filled by the media, fear and panic spread quickly, fracturing and dividing the country until at last the true goal comes into view.
[1:23:02.280 --> 1:23:08.280]  Before the St Mary's crisis, no one would have predicted the results of the election that year, no one.
[1:23:08.280 --> 1:23:12.280]  And then not long after the election, no one behold a miracle.
[1:23:12.280 --> 1:23:22.280]  Some believed it was the work of God himself, but it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members that made them all obscenely rich.
[1:23:22.280 --> 1:23:31.280]  A year later, several extremists had tried, found guilty and executed, while a memorial is built to canonize their victims.
[1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:36.280]  But the end result, the true genius of the plan was the fear.
[1:23:36.280 --> 1:23:45.280]  Fear became the ultimate tool of this government, and through it, our politician was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of the High Chancellor.
[1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:50.280]  The rest is they saying is history.
[1:23:50.280 --> 1:23:52.280]  Can you prove any of this?
[1:23:52.280 --> 1:23:57.280]  Why do you think I'm still alive?
[1:23:57.280 --> 1:24:01.280]  All right, we'd like to take you into protective custody, Mr. Rookwood.
[1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:03.280]  Oh, I'm sure you were.
[1:24:03.280 --> 1:24:08.280]  But if you want that recording, you'll do what I tell you to do.
[1:24:08.280 --> 1:24:11.280]  You put Creedy onto 24-hour surveillance.
[1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:16.280]  When I feel safe that he can't pick his nose without you knowing, I'll contact you again.
[1:24:16.280 --> 1:24:20.280]  Till then, cheerio.
[1:24:20.280 --> 1:24:26.280]  Rookwood, why didn't you come forward before?
[1:24:26.280 --> 1:24:27.280]  What were you waiting for?
[1:24:27.280 --> 1:24:31.280]  Well, for you, Inspector. I needed you.
[1:24:45.280 --> 1:24:52.280]  But it was in a right-wing political group released the weapon. It was the eugenicist death cult released it.
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:56.280]  I'm Alex Jones. I'm your host. Thank you for joining us today.
[1:24:56.280 --> 1:25:00.280]  We're going to go to the callers and the order they've been received here.
[1:25:00.280 --> 1:25:07.280]  That would mean Russell and Winston and Bruce and others first.
[1:25:07.280 --> 1:25:12.280]  But I'm going to do this now because if I don't, we won't be here. Plus, these are great products you need.
[1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:14.280]  I'm going to leave it at this.
[1:25:14.280 --> 1:25:18.280]  My information is powerful because I've done my research.
[1:25:18.280 --> 1:25:21.280]  My products are powerful.
[1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:26.280]  We can barely get the supplements in with 20, 30-week lead times because of supply chain breakdowns,
[1:25:26.280 --> 1:25:31.280]  because we won't change the formulas and cut the quality or make it in China.
[1:25:31.280 --> 1:25:37.280]  X2 is something every man, woman, and child should be on, the cleanest pyrocyanine.
[1:25:37.280 --> 1:25:43.280]  Everyone listening should make the decision to take me up on this
[1:25:43.280 --> 1:25:49.280]  and get a two-month supply, which is one bottle, for the average weight.
[1:25:49.280 --> 1:25:54.280]  Take it. And within 15 days, it has major effects on the whole body.
[1:25:54.280 --> 1:25:58.280]  You'll see it in your skin. You'll see it in your libido. But that's just side effects.
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:00.280]  Good side effects.
[1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:06.280]  It affects every cell in the body and its electrochemical purity and how it communicates.
[1:26:06.280 --> 1:26:10.280]  It is the most essential nutrient many scientists believe.
[1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:12.280]  It is tied to intelligence and everything else.
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:18.280]  If you don't have the building block, which it is, the foundation, everything else is going to be faulty.
[1:26:18.280 --> 1:26:22.280]  X2 is incredible. It's back in stock. It's 25% off.
[1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:24.280]  Get yours now while you still can.
[1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:26.280]  Also, support free speech at InfoWars.

[1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:40.280]  And again, this is not an investment. Obviously, the gold in it isn't worth anywhere near what it cost.
[1:26:40.280 --> 1:26:45.280]  There's a limited run of these. We've already sold out of about 40% of them.
[1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:52.280]  It's a InfoWars Republic Defense with original Alex Jones art.
[1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:57.280]  And on the back, it's got a hologram and the wolf chasing the sheep on the front.
[1:26:57.280 --> 1:26:59.280]  The sheepdog chasing the wolf.
[1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:05.280]  And this is so we have three, four times markup to fund the operation, but collectible.
[1:27:05.280 --> 1:27:11.280]  The coins, many of the coins we sold are already selling at two, three times the cost because they're limited edition.
[1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:12.280]  People want to be part of history.
[1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:16.280]  This is the same thing here. It's a gold bar, little ingot.
[1:27:16.280 --> 1:27:18.280]  It's amazing. And it funds the operation.

[1:33:16.280 --> 1:33:26.280]  Here we go.
[1:33:46.280 --> 1:33:56.280]  All right, we're going to go to your calls right now.
[1:33:56.280 --> 1:34:04.280]  I want to show TV viewers a few images and all narratives for the millions of radio listeners tuning in.
[1:34:04.280 --> 1:34:10.280]  These are some of the leftist activists that are now celebrating Disney because it's targeting children with sex.
[1:34:10.280 --> 1:34:17.280]  And you look at these people that are in a sexualizing children, whether they're men or women, or the NBC executive that was attacking Elon Musk,
[1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:25.280]  caught trying to have sex with a 10-year-old boy two days ago, and you look at them, and these are not the people you want to listen to on sex.
[1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:35.280]  And look, I'm a little overweight. I'm not perfect, but this woman weighs 500 to 600 pounds, and she loves Disney, and she loves the leftist agenda.
[1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:39.280]  And she's on sex strike. Well, nobody wants to have sex with her.
[1:34:39.280 --> 1:34:45.280]  And then you got the woman headed up to run the Ministry of Truth Bureau, who I never even got to yesterday, reprint that for me,
[1:34:45.280 --> 1:34:49.280]  all the time she's attacked me and said I should be silenced.
[1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:58.280]  What the CIA wants you to think its henchmen look like, got James Bond over there, versus what they actually look like.
[1:34:58.280 --> 1:35:15.280]  Crazed anti-human lunatics. Oh, and you get a 3% raise, but inflation is 5.4, 6.2, 6.8, 7.5, 7.9, 8.5, 10.25.
[1:35:15.280 --> 1:35:21.280]  Yeah, that destroys any of the chances you have to get ahead.
[1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:29.280]  It is economic warfare, plain and simple, and we've got to fight the censorship. Elon Musk says, I'm on the warpath.
[1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:36.280]  Elon Musk expected to axe Twitter's censorship team, become a CEO after he takes full control.
[1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:47.280]  You know, the jury I think is still out on Elon Musk, but everything he's doing right now makes a lot of sense, and it's a good thing.
[1:35:47.280 --> 1:35:53.280]  And a lot of people say, hey, he bought Twitter a million years ago, it's like a week ago now.
[1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:58.280]  Why isn't Alex Jones back? Well, James Woods is back, and I've seen a bunch of other folks that are back.
[1:35:58.280 --> 1:36:05.280]  Why isn't Alex Jones back? And why was the Don Salazar kicked off Twitter, one of our reporters, two days ago?
[1:36:05.280 --> 1:36:13.280]  He's not in control of it yet, but six months from now, if we're not instated, it's not about being reinstated on there.
[1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:18.280]  I was never the best Twitter anyways. Then he's full of crap.
[1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:25.280]  But if I'm back in six months, then I think he's definitely done what he said he would do.
[1:36:25.280 --> 1:36:32.280]  And I love how Musk says he's calling for investigation of far-left groups trying to pressure advertisers.
[1:36:32.280 --> 1:36:35.280]  That's racketeering. George Soros and others are fighting him.
[1:36:35.280 --> 1:36:39.280]  When you've got enemies like Bill Gates and George Soros, well, it makes me like you.
[1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:46.280]  It's definitely a real fight going on. Is it globalist battling over control or is Musk on rogue and bet on humanity?
[1:36:46.280 --> 1:36:50.280]  He says, don't depopulate yourself, don't take the shot. He says, we need more children.
[1:36:50.280 --> 1:36:59.280]  I mean, he's doing a lot of good things, but he pushes brain shifts and he pushes universal basic income, not good.
[1:36:59.280 --> 1:37:03.280]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls. Appreciate folks holding so patiently.
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:13.280]  We're going to go to the callers, the order that they have been received here. And that would mean that we are going to go to...
[1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:15.280]  Hmm.
[1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:19.280]  Chris in Arizona. Chris, welcome.
[1:37:19.280 --> 1:37:21.280]  Hey, Alex. Pleasure.
[1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:23.280]  Thank you.
[1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:29.280]  Hey, I just wanted to let you know for why I wanted to bring it up. You know, there's a war for our minds.
[1:37:29.280 --> 1:37:33.280]  We need to bring on the war, we need to bring on the war for their minds.
[1:37:33.280 --> 1:37:41.280]  I'm talking about the liberal left, the blue-haired electives and the second we have these people.
[1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:47.280]  Now, with this abortion thing going on right now, they're over there protesting.
[1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:51.280]  We need to make it look absolutely absurd what they're doing.
[1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:55.280]  Give me a favor. It sounds like you're covering your phone up with your hand. Can you talk right into it?
[1:37:55.280 --> 1:38:01.280]  Yeah, I'm talking right into it. Sorry, I'm right over at Air Force Base and they're doing drills right now, but can you hear me better now?
[1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:05.280]  Yeah, go ahead. So how do we try to wake the left up?
[1:38:05.280 --> 1:38:07.280]  Well, we need to go out there and...
[1:38:07.280 --> 1:38:15.280]  So they thought it was cute doing J6 with their little implants. What we need to do is we need to go in their protest.
[1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:23.280]  Well, they're protesting for abortion. We need to go in there and do something like protest, like puppy abortions.
[1:38:23.280 --> 1:38:28.280]  Get that on screen and, you know, that's hard for me to explain.
[1:38:28.280 --> 1:38:34.280]  But basically, you know, they don't care for human lives, but they definitely care for the animals.
[1:38:34.280 --> 1:38:37.280]  So I'm just thinking, you know, I don't know.
[1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:43.280]  No, no, Chris, definitely infiltrating leftist groups, but not having them commit crimes, not act like they do,
[1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:51.280]  not set them up, but just discover what they're doing and expose it is a beautiful idea and just illustrate absurdity with absurdity.
[1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:53.280]  That's a great idea.
[1:38:53.280 --> 1:38:58.280]  Yeah, I mean, go in there and just be like, we need to abort puppies.
[1:38:58.280 --> 1:39:00.280]  And then, you know, when other people...
[1:39:00.280 --> 1:39:02.280]  Oh, exactly. We need to abort puppies.
[1:39:02.280 --> 1:39:07.280]  And then that will... Well, wait, wait, aborting a puppy is okay. Great point. Great idea. Thank you so much.
[1:39:07.280 --> 1:39:14.280]  Let's go to a caller in Mexico, Winston in Mexico. Welcome and thank you so much for calling.
[1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:18.280]  Alex, it's great talking with you and thanks for that rush lyric from earlier.
[1:39:18.280 --> 1:39:20.280]  Yes, sir.
[1:39:20.280 --> 1:39:27.280]  I want to talk about living in Mexico and also if we have time, the manufactured global oil crisis that we're seeing.
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:29.280]  Yes, sir.
[1:39:29.280 --> 1:39:39.280]  So I've been living here for about three months. I actually left the day of the invasion and the social control I've witnessed here has been very disheartening.
[1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:47.280]  People are still wearing masks in the streets alone, in a car alone, yet they'll walk down a crowded street with something to eat.
[1:39:47.280 --> 1:39:52.280]  That's a whole debate we could have because I love Hispanic folks. They're pro-family, hardworking, smart.
[1:39:52.280 --> 1:39:57.280]  But when I'm driving around in my car, I see Hispanic men and women in their car wearing the mask.
[1:39:57.280 --> 1:40:03.280]  It's almost always a Hispanic person or an old white person. What the hell is going on there?
[1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:10.280]  They're really good people down here. I mean, they have a sense of humanity that we have lost in the United States.
[1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:17.280]  And it's one of the reasons why I came here. So it's, like I said, extremely disheartening to see this charade continue.
[1:40:17.280 --> 1:40:25.280]  So what do you think the Hispanic blind spot is for going into the combat journey?
[1:40:25.280 --> 1:40:33.280]  It's just fear. They live in fear here. There's a lot more crime. There's a lot more violence.
[1:40:33.280 --> 1:40:43.280]  There's been a huge uptick of leftist violence here. Antifa-like groups smashing 400-year-old architecture in the name of transgenderism and abortion.
[1:40:43.280 --> 1:40:52.280]  I mean, I never thought I would see that coming here. You see all over the place, spray-painted aborto and different transgender flags.
[1:40:52.280 --> 1:40:53.280]  It's really crazy.
[1:40:53.280 --> 1:41:01.280]  It's a worldwide anti-human death cult. And if we ever get the Latin Americans on board with liberty, the New World Order is dead on arrival.
[1:41:01.280 --> 1:41:08.280]  They're ready for it. They're perfect for it. And we just need to get down there and educate these folks.
[1:41:08.280 --> 1:41:14.280]  But I get it. You know, there's such a loss of control. People want like one more.
[1:41:14.280 --> 1:41:20.280]  Okay, well, you know, maybe the mask will help. No, it's a sign you're buying into the fear. It's a fraud.
[1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:23.280]  Thank you so much, sir. God bless you.
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:29.280]  All right, let's jam in one more call before we go to break. Got a minute and a half. Russell in Oregon. Go ahead, Russell.
[1:41:29.280 --> 1:41:32.280]  Alex, it's an honor to speak with you, man.
[1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:35.280]  Honored to talk to you, brother. Tell me what's on your mind.
[1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:45.280]  Well, I just wanted to talk about briefly Switzerland and this total cohesion with the globalist organizations that's happening right now.
[1:41:45.280 --> 1:41:55.280]  I know that you had a big guest on the other day talking about the World Health Assembly that's meeting the 22nd through the 28th of May.
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:42:05.280]  Well, what we didn't mention was that the World Economic Forum is having their annual meeting concurrently from the 22nd through the 26th in Davos.
[1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:10.280]  The World Health Assembly is in Geneva. One of the things...
[1:42:10.280 --> 1:42:14.280]  And they admit that they're coordinating with the WEF.
[1:42:14.280 --> 1:42:20.280]  Right. Total cohesion. And so the World Health Assembly...
[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:25.280]  Hold on, Russell. Don't hang up. I've actually got... This is part of the news I wanted to cover.
[1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:29.280]  So I'm going to come back and play the new clip of what you're talking about, and then we'll go back to you.
[1:42:29.280 --> 1:42:32.280]  Stay there, Russell. Yeah, I mean, folks, this is...
[1:42:32.280 --> 1:42:38.280]  I'm mad at myself. I'm only covering this like an hour a day. I mean, their main big move is not even Ukraine.
[1:42:38.280 --> 1:42:46.280]  It's this world government treaty, the WEF in charge of it all, the UN signed a treaty with the private corporations yesterday.
[1:42:46.280 --> 1:42:50.280]  It is the big enchilada, folks. Man.
[1:42:50.280 --> 1:43:17.280]  Well, they're right back. Stay with us at infowars.com.
[1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:23.280]  This fundraiser shirt, that is a real hit. People love it.
[1:43:23.280 --> 1:43:27.280]  It's $24.95. Alex Jones is right on the front. The Red Thunderbolt.
[1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:30.280]  And again, on the back, a big bold infowars.com.
[1:43:30.280 --> 1:43:37.280]  Exercise your First Amendment. Don't let the leftist and the globalist bully silence you and fund the infowar at the same time.
[1:43:37.280 --> 1:43:43.280]  There is not a more politically incorrect shirt that sends a stronger message of freedom, resistance to the new world order
[1:43:43.280 --> 1:43:48.280]  than the Alex Jones was right shirt, exclusively available at infowars.com.
[1:43:48.280 --> 1:43:51.280]  And again, this shirt is limited edition as well.
[1:43:51.280 --> 1:44:00.280]  We're doing one more run and then no more. InfowarsStore.com. Get yours today.
[1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:02.280]  Jacob in Ohio. Welcome. Go ahead.
[1:44:02.280 --> 1:44:04.280]  Hey, how's it going, Alex? Good, bro.
[1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:08.280]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[1:44:08.280 --> 1:44:14.280]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity.
[1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:16.280]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[1:44:16.280 --> 1:44:19.280]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[1:44:19.280 --> 1:44:23.280]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:28.280]  The XQ does wonders. They recommend it to everybody. You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence.
[1:44:28.280 --> 1:44:30.280]  Get the product. Support the Infowar.
[1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:33.280]  Tyler in Maine. You're on the air. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[1:44:33.280 --> 1:44:36.280]  Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[1:44:36.280 --> 1:44:37.280]  Honored talk to you.
[1:44:37.280 --> 1:44:43.280]  Awesome. So, firstly, I wanted to do was to say I love the products. Alpha Power, even at 29.
[1:44:43.280 --> 1:44:47.280]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[1:44:47.280 --> 1:44:49.280]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[1:44:49.280 --> 1:44:51.280]  I like that one. It works. It's not a joke.
[1:44:51.280 --> 1:44:52.280]  Absolutely.
[1:44:57.280 --> 1:45:03.280]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between free individuals
[1:45:03.280 --> 1:45:07.280]  and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other,
[1:45:07.280 --> 1:45:10.280]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[1:45:10.280 --> 1:45:14.280]  For the United States and Brazil, and, of course, triggered by the Brexit in the U.K.,
[1:45:14.280 --> 1:45:18.280]  nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[1:45:18.280 --> 1:45:25.280]  That's why they launched their great reset and their program after collapsing us of Build Back Better.
[1:45:25.280 --> 1:45:31.280]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[1:45:31.280 --> 1:45:34.280]  And because they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow,
[1:45:34.280 --> 1:45:40.280]  because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win.
[1:45:40.280 --> 1:45:43.280]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:47.280]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[1:45:47.280 --> 1:45:48.280]  It's that simple. They can't.
[1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:51.280]  Maybe it's because of our free speech and our guns.
[1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:55.280]  So, the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and, you know, the rest is history.
[1:45:55.280 --> 1:45:57.280]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[1:45:57.280 --> 1:46:00.280]  We have over 100 designs of t-shirts that just sit there in our warehouse.
[1:46:00.280 --> 1:46:06.280]  We need to sell those shirts to fund the operation, but we'd already made some orders on future shirts coming in.
[1:46:06.280 --> 1:46:07.280]  But these are all limited editions.
[1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:10.280]  So, once these new shirts come in, we're going to sell those, and that's it.
[1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:13.280]  We'll have limited editions one at a time in the future.
[1:46:13.280 --> 1:46:15.280]  And when they're gone, they're gone.
[1:46:15.280 --> 1:46:17.280]  Well, here's the new limited edition shirt.
[1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:19.280]  This one is $24.95, a really nice fabric.
[1:46:19.280 --> 1:46:24.280]  Alex Jones was right on the front of the big red lightning bolt on the back, infowars.com.
[1:46:24.280 --> 1:46:28.280]  You talk about triggering, you talk about spreading the word, you talk about waking people up.
[1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:30.280]  Alex Jones was right, fundraiser shirt.
[1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:32.280]  We need the funds to operate.
[1:46:32.280 --> 1:46:34.280]  Infowarsstore.com.
[1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:35.280]  Alex Jones was right.
[1:46:35.280 --> 1:46:36.280]  It's a gorgeous shirt.
[1:46:36.280 --> 1:46:37.280]  We're really proud of it.

[1:46:48.280 --> 1:46:53.280]  You can't do that in a better way than wearing an Alex Jones-was-right shirt with infowars.com.
[1:46:53.280 --> 1:46:54.280]  Big on the back.
[1:46:54.280 --> 1:46:59.280]  Available now for limited time, infowarsstore.com.
[1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:07.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:07.280 --> 1:47:12.280]  This afternoon, the Secretary General and Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum,
[1:47:12.280 --> 1:47:17.280]  will witness the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on a Strategic Partnership
[1:47:17.280 --> 1:47:23.280]  between the UN and the World Economic Forum, which outlines areas of cooperation to deepen engagement
[1:47:23.280 --> 1:47:29.280]  between the two institutions and to jointly accelerate the implementation of the 2030 agenda.
[1:47:29.280 --> 1:47:34.280]  I'm announcing three actions that the Department is taking to advance environmental justice.
[1:47:34.280 --> 1:47:41.280]  First, consistent with the President's executive order on tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad,
[1:47:41.280 --> 1:47:46.280]  we are issuing a comprehensive environmental justice enforcement strategy.
[1:47:46.280 --> 1:47:52.280]  Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta will discuss that strategy in just a moment.
[1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:56.280]  Second, I'm pleased to announce that we are launching the Justice Department's first-ever
[1:47:56.280 --> 1:48:02.280]  Office of Environmental Justice to oversee and help guide the Justice Department's
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:06.280]  wide-ranging environmental justice efforts.
[1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:11.280]  Like all parts of government, it will get its own acronym, OEJ.
[1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:17.280]  And third, the Justice Department is issuing an interim final rule that will restore the use
[1:48:17.280 --> 1:48:22.280]  of an important law enforcement tool, supplemental environmental projects,
[1:48:22.280 --> 1:48:27.280]  subject to new guidelines and limitations that I will also be issuing today.
[1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:32.280]  Administrator Regan and I know that the communities most impacted by environmental harm
[1:48:32.280 --> 1:48:36.280]  are not isolated in any one part of our country.
[1:48:36.280 --> 1:48:42.280]  Environmental crime and injustice touch communities in all our cities, towns, rural areas,
[1:48:42.280 --> 1:48:48.280]  and on tribal lands. Although violations of our environmental laws can happen anywhere,
[1:48:48.280 --> 1:48:55.280]  communities of color, indigenous communities, and low-income communities often bear the brunt
[1:48:55.280 --> 1:49:01.280]  of the harm caused by environmental crime, pollution, and climate change.
[1:49:01.280 --> 1:49:07.280]  They include communities, fence-line communities, where exposure to toxic air pollutants
[1:49:07.280 --> 1:49:12.280]  causes scores of cancer-related deaths.
[1:49:38.280 --> 1:49:50.280]  And everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows that the boat is leaking,
[1:49:50.280 --> 1:49:59.280]  everybody knows the captain line, everybody got this broken feeling,
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:08.280]  like their father or their dog just died, everybody talking to their pockets,
[1:50:08.280 --> 1:50:15.280]  everybody wants a box of chocolate and a non-stem rose.
[1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:22.280]  And everybody knows, but everybody doesn't know yet, yeah.
[1:50:22.280 --> 1:50:31.280]  Everybody knows that you're a love man, baby. Everybody knows that you really do.
[1:50:31.280 --> 1:50:40.280]  Everybody knows that you've been faithful, give or take, night or two.
[1:50:40.280 --> 1:50:47.280]  Everybody knows you've been discreet, but there were so many people
[1:50:47.280 --> 1:50:54.280]  you just had to meet without your clothes.
[1:50:54.280 --> 1:51:08.280]  And everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows.
[1:51:08.280 --> 1:51:18.280]  That's how it goes.
[1:51:18.280 --> 1:51:26.280]  Everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows.
[1:51:26.280 --> 1:51:34.280]  That's how it goes.
[1:51:34.280 --> 1:51:39.280]  All right, Russell in Oregon, thanks for holding everybody else as well.
[1:51:39.280 --> 1:51:41.280]  Russell, you really make a big point.
[1:51:41.280 --> 1:51:43.280]  I mean, we have world government being announced.
[1:51:43.280 --> 1:51:48.280]  I had, we came in to break Antonio Gutierrez, the General Secretary of the U.N.
[1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:52.280]  saying that they are now merged with the Bilderberg Group and its public organization,
[1:51:52.280 --> 1:51:57.280]  the World Economic Forum, so the Justice Department saying this is their new big push.
[1:51:57.280 --> 1:52:02.280]  Nothing to do with the environment, total power grab, total control, medical tyranny.
[1:52:02.280 --> 1:52:06.280]  And you are making some great points. Please continue.
[1:52:06.280 --> 1:52:07.280]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:52:07.280 --> 1:52:12.280]  Well, it's not just the U.N. and the World Economic Forum, but also, of course,
[1:52:12.280 --> 1:52:19.280]  the World Health Organization and that their assembly is concurring
[1:52:19.280 --> 1:52:24.280]  with the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.
[1:52:24.280 --> 1:52:30.280]  One of the things that is just amazing, I was looking at the agenda for the World Health Assembly.
[1:52:30.280 --> 1:52:35.280]  One of the items on the agenda is addressing iodine deficiency disorder.
[1:52:35.280 --> 1:52:38.280]  So I thought that you would be interested in that.
[1:52:38.280 --> 1:52:41.280]  No, tell me about, I mean, because they obsess on it,
[1:52:41.280 --> 1:52:46.280]  because they're the ones putting stuff that blocks iodine, chlorine, fluoride, bromine in the water.
[1:52:46.280 --> 1:52:48.280]  I mean, I don't just sell iodine and just say it's important.
[1:52:48.280 --> 1:52:51.280]  They're literally obsessed with keeping us from iodine,
[1:52:51.280 --> 1:52:56.280]  just like the U.M. will order world lockdowns and start 40 million people to death the last two years
[1:52:56.280 --> 1:52:59.280]  on top of who dies, and then they say, oh my God, they're starving.
[1:52:59.280 --> 1:53:03.280]  So what are they saying about iodine?
[1:53:03.280 --> 1:53:04.280]  I don't know yet.
[1:53:04.280 --> 1:53:10.280]  You can look at the World Health Assembly website on the WHO website,
[1:53:10.280 --> 1:53:16.280]  and one of the items on the agenda for the 22nd through the 28th assembly
[1:53:16.280 --> 1:53:18.280]  is iodine deficiency disorder.
[1:53:18.280 --> 1:53:21.280]  So I don't know the exact nature of it, but this is...
[1:53:21.280 --> 1:53:25.280]  Well, it is the number one health cause on earth, they admit.
[1:53:25.280 --> 1:53:27.280]  I don't just believe the U.N. I've checked it out.
[1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:30.280]  I was educated by top scientists about those 10 years ago,
[1:53:30.280 --> 1:53:31.280]  but it's just incredible.
[1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:33.280]  But then meanwhile, they bombard us.
[1:53:33.280 --> 1:53:37.280]  You understand, when you've got chlorine, bromide, fluoride, all of it,
[1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:41.280]  it blocks the good halogen.
[1:53:41.280 --> 1:53:47.280]  Well, I completely understand that, and that's why I religiously take the nascent iodine,
[1:53:47.280 --> 1:53:49.280]  the X3, the X2.
[1:53:49.280 --> 1:53:55.280]  It's an amazing product, and I have felt a true difference in my function.
[1:53:55.280 --> 1:53:59.280]  I wanted to bring up one last thing, and this is a really big tie-it-all together
[1:53:59.280 --> 1:54:05.280]  with what's going on there in Switzerland is the summit of all globalist activity.
[1:54:05.280 --> 1:54:11.280]  CERN has just fired up the Large Hadron Collider for the first time in four years
[1:54:11.280 --> 1:54:13.280]  as of April 22nd.
[1:54:13.280 --> 1:54:18.280]  That is one month, 30 days to the day before the start of the World Health Assembly
[1:54:18.280 --> 1:54:21.280]  and the World Economic Forum annual meeting.
[1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:25.280]  And we know that at the Large Hadron Collider, they are doing...
[1:54:25.280 --> 1:54:28.280]  Blasting interdimensional holes.
[1:54:28.280 --> 1:54:31.280]  Interdimensional holes. They are trying to become God.
[1:54:31.280 --> 1:54:32.280]  They are trying to...
[1:54:32.280 --> 1:54:34.280]  And by the way, they say that themselves.
[1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:36.280]  They admit there's multiple dimensions.
[1:54:36.280 --> 1:54:38.280]  There's a dimension five times stronger than ours.
[1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:40.280]  That's the next dimension holding us in.
[1:54:40.280 --> 1:54:42.280]  They're trying to blast their way through it.
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:46.280]  Even though they admit it could create a black hole or a strange lid and destroy the planet.
[1:54:46.280 --> 1:54:52.280]  Because again, colliding uranium and plutonium, folks, gives you, you know, hundreds of bombs.
[1:54:52.280 --> 1:54:58.280]  Well, imagine what they're doing firing different isotopes and different heavy metals
[1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:02.280]  like uranium and plutonium into blocks of lead.
[1:55:02.280 --> 1:55:07.280]  I mean, they admit it could destroy the planet, but they want to learn what's happening.
[1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:11.280]  Well, and that's why they call the Higgs boson the God particle.
[1:55:11.280 --> 1:55:12.280]  This is their whole thing.
[1:55:12.280 --> 1:55:16.280]  They want to use the LHC to become God.
[1:55:16.280 --> 1:55:19.280]  And again, they fired it up.
[1:55:19.280 --> 1:55:26.280]  It has been in an inactive state for four years, and they just turned it back on a couple weeks ago.
[1:55:26.280 --> 1:55:28.280]  One month before...
[1:55:28.280 --> 1:55:29.280]  Well, that's because it blew up.
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:32.280]  They blew up with whatever they did last time.
[1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:33.280]  It was scheduled.
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:36.280]  They have these off periods.
[1:55:36.280 --> 1:55:39.280]  They run it for a couple years, then they have the off periods,
[1:55:39.280 --> 1:55:44.280]  and they are able to process the data that they collected from the trials in those off periods.
[1:55:44.280 --> 1:55:46.280]  So they are firing it back up.
[1:55:46.280 --> 1:55:51.280]  And I just wanted to remind everybody, do you remember about eight, nine years ago
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:58.280]  when these video surfaced from CERN, where they were doing these mock, like, satanic rituals
[1:55:58.280 --> 1:56:00.280]  with mock execution in front of them?
[1:56:00.280 --> 1:56:02.280]  Yeah, guys, guys pull up satanic rituals at CERN.
[1:56:02.280 --> 1:56:07.280]  They had everybody like an ice-white shed in juridic robes out doing sacrifices
[1:56:07.280 --> 1:56:11.280]  for the giant God Shiva above them in a huge statue.
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:12.280]  Yes, I remember those.
[1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:15.280]  And this went totally under the radar.
[1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:17.280]  It was such a joke, but this is real.
[1:56:17.280 --> 1:56:20.280]  And if the crew doesn't find it, I don't blame them in the next minute and a half.
[1:56:20.280 --> 1:56:23.280]  Add it in post when we upload this demand on video.
[1:56:23.280 --> 1:56:24.280]  Oh, they found it.
[1:56:24.280 --> 1:56:25.280]  Great job.
[1:56:25.280 --> 1:56:26.280]  Yeah, show us the viewers.
[1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:27.280]  The crew is incredible.
[1:56:27.280 --> 1:56:29.280]  They found that in 10 seconds.
[1:56:29.280 --> 1:56:32.280]  The other thing, Alex, that's going on in Switzerland.
[1:56:32.280 --> 1:56:37.280]  I mean, Switzerland is the locus of the globalist takeover.
[1:56:37.280 --> 1:56:39.280]  I mean, it's where it's all happening.
[1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:46.280]  And Novartis, which is the largest pharmaceutical company in Switzerland, formerly Sandos,
[1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:50.280]  where Albert Hoffman discovered LSD in 1943.
[1:56:50.280 --> 1:56:59.280]  They are now Novartis, and they are, as of 2019, collaborating with Microsoft.
[1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:00.280]  Hold on.
[1:57:00.280 --> 1:57:01.280]  I'm going to hold you over again.
[1:57:01.280 --> 1:57:02.280]  We pushed our guests back.
[1:57:02.280 --> 1:57:03.280]  Everybody stay there.
[1:57:03.280 --> 1:57:04.280]  I'm going to tell everybody.
[1:57:04.280 --> 1:57:05.280]  Jordan and everybody else.
[1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:09.280]  But look how they take the beautiful woman as the goddess.
[1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:13.280]  You see it and put her in front of Shiva and they do a mock human sacrifice.
[1:57:13.280 --> 1:57:15.280]  I mean, this is insane.
[1:57:15.280 --> 1:57:18.280]  I'm glad you reminded me of this, brother.
[1:57:18.280 --> 1:57:21.280]  Well, it's just important stuff.
[1:57:21.280 --> 1:57:22.280]  And this is real.
[1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:23.280]  It's not a joke.
[1:57:23.280 --> 1:57:26.280]  And again, I want to just go back to that.
[1:57:26.280 --> 1:57:34.280]  Novartis, in 2019, signed an agreement to work with Microsoft to use AI technology,
[1:57:34.280 --> 1:57:40.280]  cutting edge AI technology to develop research on chimeric antigen reactor.
[1:57:40.280 --> 1:57:41.280]  Oh, they've created the whole thing.
[1:57:41.280 --> 1:57:42.280]  It's on record.
[1:57:42.280 --> 1:57:43.280]  Incredible.
[1:57:43.280 --> 1:57:44.280]  More calls coming up.
[1:57:44.280 --> 1:57:47.280]  Stay with us.
[1:57:47.280 --> 1:57:53.280]  Here at Info Wars, our slogan is tomorrow's news today, whether it's politics or health
[1:57:53.280 --> 1:57:54.280]  or spirituality.
[1:57:54.280 --> 1:58:01.280]  We're about bringing you the very best documented, accurate real world information.
[1:58:01.280 --> 1:58:05.280]  And when it comes to our supplements, they are so game changing for your body, for your
[1:58:05.280 --> 1:58:09.280]  health, your immunity, your libido, your middle clarity.
[1:58:09.280 --> 1:58:10.280]  They're incredible.
[1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:14.280]  And out of all the products, X2 is definitely the most amazing.
[1:58:14.280 --> 1:58:19.280]  It is the purest, highest quality atomic iodine you're going to find.
[1:58:19.280 --> 1:58:25.280]  Most other iodine out there is bound to other minerals and compounds, so you don't absorb
[1:58:25.280 --> 1:58:27.280]  it at all or fully.
[1:58:27.280 --> 1:58:31.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got a limited supply, and it's been sold out for months because
[1:58:31.280 --> 1:58:32.280]  supply chain break downs.
[1:58:32.280 --> 1:58:36.280]  But despite that, we're selling it at 25% off for one more week.
[1:58:36.280 --> 1:58:37.280]  Then it goes back to full price.
[1:58:37.280 --> 1:58:40.280]  Within two weeks, the current sales rate is going to sell out.
[1:58:40.280 --> 1:58:44.280]  Experience X2 for yourself today at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:44.280 --> 1:58:46.280]  X2 at infowarstore.com.

[1:58:51.280 --> 1:58:53.280]  word of mouth and prayer.
[1:58:53.280 --> 1:58:56.280]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[1:58:56.280 --> 1:59:00.280]  caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[1:59:00.280 --> 1:59:03.280]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[1:59:03.280 --> 1:59:07.280]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at infowarstore.com like books and films and
[1:59:07.280 --> 1:59:09.280]  supplements and water filtration.
[1:59:09.280 --> 1:59:10.280]  Air filtration is so much more.
[1:59:10.280 --> 1:59:13.280]  But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation so we get almost
[1:59:13.280 --> 1:59:19.280]  100% of the money to fund our operation during this critical time, go to infowarstore.com

[1:59:31.280 --> 1:59:35.280]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support Freedom to take action
[1:59:35.280 --> 1:59:39.280]  now and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's countering the great

[2:00:16.280 --> 2:00:44.280]  Thank you.
[2:00:44.280 --> 2:01:09.280]  We're going to go to Jordan in a moment.
[2:01:09.280 --> 2:01:16.280]  Let's go to Robert in Texas.
[2:01:16.280 --> 2:01:17.280]  Robert, welcome.
[2:01:17.280 --> 2:01:18.280]  Hello.
[2:01:18.280 --> 2:01:19.280]  Hello.
[2:01:19.280 --> 2:01:20.280]  Yes, sir.
[2:01:20.280 --> 2:01:21.280]  Good to talk to you.
[2:01:21.280 --> 2:01:22.280]  My pleasure.
[2:01:22.280 --> 2:01:23.280]  Hey, three points.
[2:01:23.280 --> 2:01:24.280]  I'm going to get the business quick.
[2:01:24.280 --> 2:01:25.280]  Number one, Jason Ramis.
[2:01:25.280 --> 2:01:26.280]  If I'm saying the last name correctly.
[2:01:26.280 --> 2:01:27.280]  Jason Burmus.
[2:01:27.280 --> 2:01:28.280]  Burmus.
[2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:29.280]  Yes, sir.
[2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:33.280]  Outstanding presentation for the fourth hour Tuesday.
[2:01:33.280 --> 2:01:36.280]  I was like, man, I recognize that.
[2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:39.280]  I watched it while I had my lunch and had meetings.
[2:01:39.280 --> 2:01:40.280]  I watch most of it.
[2:01:40.280 --> 2:01:42.280]  And Jason's a smart cookie.
[2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:43.280]  Yeah, man.
[2:01:43.280 --> 2:01:48.280]  So my point is I'd love to see more of him at four hours.
[2:01:48.280 --> 2:01:56.280]  Don't miss that invisible empire is an excellent documentary available free on YouTube.
[2:01:56.280 --> 2:01:57.280]  I know.
[2:01:57.280 --> 2:01:58.280]  I produced it.
[2:01:58.280 --> 2:02:00.280]  It's a good film.
[2:02:00.280 --> 2:02:06.280]  If you're interested in what is the New World Order, check out invisible empire.
[2:02:06.280 --> 2:02:12.280]  Number two, this is my product endorsement to you.
[2:02:12.280 --> 2:02:20.280]  About 10, 12 years ago, you offered the full library of DVDs, all of your DVDs.
[2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:27.280]  These include Bohemian Grove, Endgame, Police State, all those.
[2:02:27.280 --> 2:02:28.280]  You had a package deal.
[2:02:28.280 --> 2:02:30.280]  It was a sweetheart deal.
[2:02:30.280 --> 2:02:35.280]  And I'm recommending that you consider offering something like that.
[2:02:35.280 --> 2:02:38.280]  You know, hey, you get the whole library, you've got them on hard disk.
[2:02:38.280 --> 2:02:45.280]  And this is back when you could watch all those videos for free on YouTube.
[2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:49.280]  But I wanted them on hard copy.
[2:02:49.280 --> 2:02:50.280]  So I'm recommending that.
[2:02:50.280 --> 2:02:51.280]  Well, we've got Endgame.
[2:02:51.280 --> 2:02:55.280]  We've got the very powerful covered land series.
[2:02:55.280 --> 2:02:59.280]  All that's available on DVD and info or store.com.
[2:02:59.280 --> 2:03:01.280]  We're just so cash trapped.
[2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:04.280]  It's hard for us to buy a bunch of DVDs.
[2:03:04.280 --> 2:03:06.280]  It's hard for us to buy a bunch of product.
[2:03:06.280 --> 2:03:09.280]  I mean, we're, we're very in battle like the media spun it.
[2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:12.280]  Jones says he's down to $3 million.
[2:03:12.280 --> 2:03:14.280]  That's $3 million he's got.
[2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:15.280]  No, I got to buy product.
[2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:16.280]  I got to run the place.
[2:03:16.280 --> 2:03:17.280]  That's nothing.
[2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:20.280]  And then we got $2 million in Bitcoin donations.
[2:03:20.280 --> 2:03:24.280]  And I put half of it out there to get any of the money right away.
[2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:25.280]  I hope Bitcoin goes back up.
[2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:26.280]  It probably will.
[2:03:26.280 --> 2:03:27.280]  Then I'll sell it later.
[2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:30.280]  But I mean, we are still treading water here.
[2:03:30.280 --> 2:03:32.280]  And that's why I appreciate all your support.
[2:03:32.280 --> 2:03:36.280]  But you can find a lot of films, a lot of DVDs at info or store.com.
[2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:40.280]  But most of you see have that, you know, some of them have that join the waiting list because
[2:03:40.280 --> 2:03:41.280]  a lot of them have been sold out.
[2:03:41.280 --> 2:03:44.280]  And we just haven't had the money to go reprint them.
[2:03:44.280 --> 2:03:49.280]  But yes, it's so important to have these on hard copy where you can share them in all
[2:03:49.280 --> 2:03:50.280]  my films.
[2:03:50.280 --> 2:03:52.280]  You're authorized and encouraged to make copies.
[2:03:52.280 --> 2:03:54.280]  So thank you so much, Robert.
[2:03:54.280 --> 2:03:56.280]  All right, we're going to break.
[2:03:56.280 --> 2:04:03.280]  We're going to come back and we're going to go to Jordan, Harve, Bruce, Scott, Kyle,
[2:04:03.280 --> 2:04:04.280]  and Alex.
[2:04:04.280 --> 2:04:08.280]  And I'm going to give each caller about a minute and a half.
[2:04:08.280 --> 2:04:10.280]  And we're just going to get to the next person.
[2:04:10.280 --> 2:04:14.280]  But yeah, listen, nobody hates plugging and selling products more than I do.
[2:04:14.280 --> 2:04:15.280]  So I'm going to sell products.
[2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:18.280]  They're going to be great because I feel good about that because I want you to buy them
[2:04:18.280 --> 2:04:19.280]  again so they work.
[2:04:19.280 --> 2:04:20.280]  I want you to like them.
[2:04:20.280 --> 2:04:25.280]  I would rather just have some billionaire give me $50 million a year to run this operation.
[2:04:25.280 --> 2:04:26.280]  That's a lot of money.
[2:04:26.280 --> 2:04:28.280]  No, it's not anymore, folks.
[2:04:28.280 --> 2:04:31.280]  We're spending $10 million a year on bandwidth.
[2:04:31.280 --> 2:04:33.280]  We're a victim of our own success.
[2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:35.280]  We have massive bills.
[2:04:35.280 --> 2:04:38.280]  And that's why I don't want to lose to these people.
[2:04:38.280 --> 2:04:43.280]  And that's why I'm counting on you to go to infoworkstore.com.
[2:04:43.280 --> 2:04:44.280]  It's a shop with us.

[2:06:27.280 --> 2:06:33.280]  us out which shows us that humanity is strong and you are strong and I salute you and I
[2:06:33.280 --> 2:06:36.280]  thank you for keeping us on air.
[2:06:36.280 --> 2:06:39.280]  You are the resistance literally.
[2:06:39.280 --> 2:06:41.280]  Jordan in New Mexico.
[2:06:41.280 --> 2:06:42.280]  Jordan thanks for calling.
[2:06:42.280 --> 2:06:43.280]  Thanks for holding.
[2:06:43.280 --> 2:06:44.280]  Welcome.
[2:06:44.280 --> 2:06:49.280]  Thank you Samaritan Jones for having me.
[2:06:49.280 --> 2:06:54.280]  Without further ado I just want to raise an issue and I'm calling on you to coin a new
[2:06:54.280 --> 2:06:56.280]  term for the new age that we're in.
[2:06:56.280 --> 2:07:03.280]  I agree with Mr. Fink that globalism is dead and that as you have coined terms in the past
[2:07:03.280 --> 2:07:10.280]  sir we need to coin a term for this transhumanist technocrat system that's now taking the place
[2:07:10.280 --> 2:07:12.280]  of what was the globalist system.
[2:07:12.280 --> 2:07:17.280]  High tech cannibalism, satanic science, what did you call it?
[2:07:17.280 --> 2:07:19.280]  I urge you to come up with something sir.
[2:07:19.280 --> 2:07:22.280]  I'm sure you will but I think it's time to dispossess ourselves.
[2:07:22.280 --> 2:07:25.280]  Globalism they admit it was always a lot of everybody under their control.
[2:07:25.280 --> 2:07:32.280]  Then they bring in the collapse and high tech Elysium cities, golden field cities that are
[2:07:32.280 --> 2:07:34.280]  above everybody's control while we all starve.
[2:07:34.280 --> 2:07:36.280]  I don't know what you call it.
[2:07:36.280 --> 2:07:42.280]  I mean we should have a whole show about what do we call post-globalism?
[2:07:42.280 --> 2:07:45.280]  Yes, symposium if you will.
[2:07:45.280 --> 2:07:47.280]  That's one of them.
[2:07:47.280 --> 2:07:48.280]  The new dark age?
[2:07:48.280 --> 2:07:49.280]  I mean what do you want to call it?
[2:07:49.280 --> 2:07:51.280]  The new scientific dark age?
[2:07:51.280 --> 2:07:53.280]  That's a good question.
[2:07:53.280 --> 2:07:58.280]  I think Mr. Dyer should be involved in this conversation and you should have some titular
[2:07:58.280 --> 2:07:59.280]  heads.
[2:07:59.280 --> 2:08:00.280]  Let's go back.
[2:08:00.280 --> 2:08:01.280]  We covered that three weeks ago.
[2:08:01.280 --> 2:08:06.280]  How big is it to have the head of BlackRock and also Vanguard, the same company, tap one
[2:08:06.280 --> 2:08:11.280]  of the top New World Order people even above Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates say globalism is
[2:08:11.280 --> 2:08:13.280]  dead, the public's turned against us.
[2:08:13.280 --> 2:08:15.280]  We're known to say the answer is collapse.
[2:08:15.280 --> 2:08:17.280]  That's their weapon is to collapse.
[2:08:17.280 --> 2:08:21.280]  Instead of him going to jail like Bernie Madoff, he just starves you to death and you put
[2:08:21.280 --> 2:08:22.280]  up with it.
[2:08:22.280 --> 2:08:28.280]  Yeah, here's the thing and Dyer touched upon this in a couple of shows in the past weeks.
[2:08:28.280 --> 2:08:32.280]  HG Wells and then talked about the froth of the capitalist system being the grid which
[2:08:32.280 --> 2:08:35.280]  they'll use in order to bring in their new system, the new Aeon as they call it.
[2:08:35.280 --> 2:08:39.280]  Yeah, they said we'll use the power of capitalism and free market to build the new
[2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:40.280]  present.
[2:08:40.280 --> 2:08:41.280]  Correct.
[2:08:41.280 --> 2:08:45.280]  That's what they have and part of the grid system and part of the reason for the replacement
[2:08:45.280 --> 2:08:49.280]  migration is to get the people out of the lower areas of Latin America and the third
[2:08:49.280 --> 2:08:53.280]  world and bring them to the big grid of the first world so they can guess what killed
[2:08:53.280 --> 2:08:55.280]  them slowly as they started to kill us.
[2:08:55.280 --> 2:08:59.280]  Do the same thing they've done with us with this medical authority, which they'll run
[2:08:59.280 --> 2:09:03.280]  in the first world systems that they're slowly collapsing, but not quick enough in order to
[2:09:03.280 --> 2:09:08.280]  get the resources so we'll all wink, wink while they're killing the third world people.
[2:09:08.280 --> 2:09:09.280]  Yeah.
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:10.280]  You know what I'm saying?
[2:09:10.280 --> 2:09:11.280]  It's a total plan.
[2:09:11.280 --> 2:09:15.280]  They admit their plan and Jay Dyer is going to be hosting the fourth hour, so he is quite
[2:09:15.280 --> 2:09:16.280]  the brain.
[2:09:16.280 --> 2:09:17.280]  Thank you so much.
[2:09:17.280 --> 2:09:18.280]  Great points.
[2:09:18.280 --> 2:09:19.280]  All right.
[2:09:19.280 --> 2:09:22.280]  Let's take a call from Harv in California.
[2:09:22.280 --> 2:09:23.280]  Welcome, Harv.
[2:09:23.280 --> 2:09:24.280]  Hi, Alex.
[2:09:24.280 --> 2:09:28.280]  It's an honor and a pleasure, but within a minute and a half, I guess we'll get going
[2:09:28.280 --> 2:09:29.280]  real quick.
[2:09:29.280 --> 2:09:33.520]  I've been noticing a lot of things popping up in my social media feed and even coming
[2:09:33.520 --> 2:09:37.680]  from people that I talked to that are not religious at all, starting to just bring up
[2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:39.280]  the topic of the four horsemen.
[2:09:39.280 --> 2:09:43.720]  Now, I've been thinking about this, and I'm starting to see a lot of correlations that
[2:09:43.720 --> 2:09:48.040]  looks like we are really starting to check off the boxes for the arrival of the four
[2:09:48.040 --> 2:09:49.760]  horsemen.
[2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:54.480]  We already have pestilence, famine, death, and war, right?
[2:09:54.480 --> 2:10:02.120]  With coronavirus and the poking smoke, we already have pestilence, with we have every
[2:10:02.120 --> 2:10:07.360]  government leader right now, basically, saying that the world is about six months away from
[2:10:07.360 --> 2:10:13.080]  a global food crisis and famine, with people trying to escalate the conflict in Ukraine
[2:10:13.080 --> 2:10:17.880]  into potentially a global conflict, as well as all of the social dissidents we're seeing
[2:10:17.880 --> 2:10:23.520]  across the world that could easily spiral into civil wars across the world.
[2:10:23.520 --> 2:10:28.120]  I just wondered, do you think that maybe we might be seeing the arrival of the four horsemen?
[2:10:28.120 --> 2:10:30.680]  Well, there's echoes of this.
[2:10:30.680 --> 2:10:33.920]  There's many antichrists that are like little waves before the big wave.
[2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:37.960]  There's the antichrist and the devil have the same program, so he's always trying to
[2:10:37.960 --> 2:10:39.080]  enforce it.
[2:10:39.080 --> 2:10:45.040]  But yeah, I mean, we are entering Agenda 2030, that is, the globalists believe a collapse
[2:10:45.040 --> 2:10:50.400]  is coming, so they want to implement it before it happens, so they control it.
[2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:56.400]  All right, well, yeah, thank you for that, and I guess I need to get out of the way,
[2:10:56.400 --> 2:10:57.920]  because if you have any callers like the...
[2:10:57.920 --> 2:10:58.920]  No, no, I mean, that's it.
[2:10:58.920 --> 2:11:01.840]  No, no, you're making great points, brother, thank you for bringing that up.
[2:11:01.840 --> 2:11:02.840]  Thank you.
[2:11:02.840 --> 2:11:04.440]  All right, let's take another call here.
[2:11:04.440 --> 2:11:10.120]  Let's talk to Bruce in North Carolina, welcome.
[2:11:10.120 --> 2:11:11.120]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:11:11.120 --> 2:11:12.120]  Yes, sir.
[2:11:12.120 --> 2:11:19.160]  I called to tell you who is in the New World Order, and Alex Jones is known by many names.
[2:11:19.160 --> 2:11:24.120]  He might be called Alex, he might be called father, he might be called boss, entrepreneur.
[2:11:24.120 --> 2:11:30.160]  Back in the day, there were these people called the Igiggy, the Nephilim, the Watchers, and
[2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:31.920]  the fallen angels.
[2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:34.400]  These were the same people.
[2:11:34.400 --> 2:11:42.560]  At 425 AD, the fallen angel Constantine got some of his pals together, and they rewrote
[2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:49.080]  the Hebrew Bible in the Council of Nicaea to create what you would call the Holy Bible
[2:11:49.080 --> 2:11:50.080]  now.
[2:11:50.080 --> 2:11:55.360]  So, take the fallen angels, and they made themselves the Romans at that time to retain
[2:11:55.360 --> 2:12:00.400]  their rank and kind of hide their name and start the New World.
[2:12:00.400 --> 2:12:02.280]  Another New World Order that was then.
[2:12:02.280 --> 2:12:09.320]  So now, take the fallen angels and replace the Romans that you know today with fallen
[2:12:09.320 --> 2:12:10.320]  angels.
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:15.760]  Then you had the fallen angel empire, you had the fallen angel Catholic Church, and it goes
[2:12:15.760 --> 2:12:17.960]  on and on and on from there.
[2:12:17.960 --> 2:12:22.920]  Really hard to unpack a 14-hour conversation in 90 seconds, so I started right there in
[2:12:22.920 --> 2:12:24.960]  the middle with the fallen angels.
[2:12:24.960 --> 2:12:33.240]  And they were the servants of the gods, Yahweh, Muhammad, Muhammad and Yahweh had children.
[2:12:33.240 --> 2:12:38.480]  Yahweh had children, one of his children's name was Marduk, guess what, Marduk wanted
[2:12:38.480 --> 2:12:44.520]  to be a god too, so Yahweh said, okay son, here carve out a spot in my realm here.
[2:12:44.520 --> 2:12:51.920]  So Marduk went down and made Egypt and made himself Rah, so now Marduk is a god.
[2:12:51.920 --> 2:12:59.800]  One of Muhammad's children wanted to be a god, so Inanna, his grandchild, was granted
[2:12:59.800 --> 2:13:05.680]  her own domain, she became Sri Lachmi in the Indus Valley.
[2:13:05.680 --> 2:13:11.200]  This is why we have gods all over the planet and all this ultra-intent architecture that
[2:13:11.200 --> 2:13:15.880]  cannot be reproduced today.
[2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:17.960]  What you got for me?
[2:13:17.960 --> 2:13:20.280]  Very interesting, I appreciate your call, we're taking your calls.
[2:13:20.280 --> 2:13:24.480]  All right, let's talk to Scott in Texas, go ahead Scott.
[2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:30.960]  Hey, how's it going, good to talk to you as always, one of the touch on the Bars pandemic
[2:13:30.960 --> 2:13:37.960]  program, it basically talks about the loss of confidence in all government officials,
[2:13:37.960 --> 2:13:44.640]  all government leaders, all established establishments, so this is all part of the plan in my opinion,
[2:13:44.640 --> 2:13:49.720]  like it talks about in the Bars document, a couple other points real quick, to fight
[2:13:49.720 --> 2:13:57.640]  censorship, I recommend trying to get a hold of Matthew Ramer with contentsafe.co, he'll
[2:13:57.640 --> 2:14:05.000]  help you bypass censorship, I'm sure he'll help you as part of the team Alex, solutions
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  you are speaking of, go to CorbettReport.com, James Corbett does a whole series on solutions,
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:21.080]  and if I could get a sound bite from you, just say go to GrandTheftWorld.com.
[2:14:21.080 --> 2:14:24.720]  You know, it's hard for me to plug something, I don't know what it is, you sound like a
[2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:31.800]  nice guy, but I don't know what that sign is, send me a clip to showtipsininfowars.com
[2:14:31.800 --> 2:14:36.600]  brother and I will check it out, but I can't endorse something, people say why don't you
[2:14:36.600 --> 2:14:40.560]  just get sponsors, well I've got to vet them and check them and then test them and make
[2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:45.400]  sure people like it before I do it, I can have 100 sponsors, but I can only bring sponsors
[2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:48.280]  that I know are really great but I appreciate your call.
[2:14:48.280 --> 2:14:54.880]  Kyle, let's talk about the collapse and what is the plan, and I will get to Kyle if Kyle
[2:14:54.880 --> 2:14:59.760]  holds 45 minutes, we have a special guest joining us, but then I want to answer that
[2:14:59.760 --> 2:15:03.400]  question because that's the big question, I don't even have all the answers, I'll take
[2:15:03.400 --> 2:15:08.000]  a little bit of Jay Dyer's time coming up in the fourth hour and answer Kyle's question,
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:12.280]  and even if Kyle hangs up, I'll be able to talk about the collapse and what the plan
[2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:17.840]  is, does he mean their plan or what is our plan, this is such an incredible time and
[2:15:17.840 --> 2:15:22.480]  if we just think big picture, we think about being empowered and we think about being informed
[2:15:22.480 --> 2:15:27.160]  and we think about how things will run, they won't be able to do this to us, so I'm trying
[2:15:27.160 --> 2:15:31.880]  to get people literate on the New World Order, literate on how it operates because I believe
[2:15:31.880 --> 2:15:37.640]  in you, I'm betting on you, I don't think your garbage like the New World Order does,
[2:15:37.640 --> 2:15:42.040]  I think I'm great, I project on you, I think you're great, and you are, project on me that
[2:15:42.040 --> 2:15:45.920]  I'm great, I project on you together, we're going to go to the stars and beyond, let's
[2:15:45.920 --> 2:15:52.640]  do it in Jesus Christ's name, all right, band.video, battleplan.news, share those links, share
[2:15:52.640 --> 2:16:03.400]  those videos, we'll be right back.
[2:16:03.400 --> 2:16:07.000]  And we've been getting a lot of crypto donations which is keeping us on here, want to salute

[2:17:05.320 --> 2:17:10.560]  Yeah, and first of all, let me say I love your products, I am a Brandy and for all
[2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:15.160]  the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was
[2:17:15.160 --> 2:17:20.760]  loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called, but since taking your X2
[2:17:20.760 --> 2:17:25.800]  for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually, people think I'm
[2:17:25.800 --> 2:17:32.400]  55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, well maybe
[2:17:32.400 --> 2:17:36.960]  that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started
[2:17:36.960 --> 2:17:42.760]  taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately, but over a period of time, I started noticing
[2:17:42.760 --> 2:17:49.360]  okay, this is the ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, I don't have to put on
[2:17:49.360 --> 2:17:55.160]  derma blend anymore, so anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared
[2:17:55.160 --> 2:17:58.440]  up my skin.
[2:17:58.440 --> 2:18:05.480]  Over the years, M4 Wars has produced more than 200 amazing, Patriot Americana, Second

[2:19:51.200 --> 2:19:59.200]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action, take action now, InfowarsLive.com.
[2:19:59.200 --> 2:20:17.880]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:17.880 --> 2:20:23.280]  The answer to 1984 tyranny is 1776 Liberty.
[2:20:23.280 --> 2:20:30.560]  All right, I want everybody to listen to me very, very carefully, I respect you all,
[2:20:30.560 --> 2:20:36.760]  and any advice I would give you is advice I would take on my soul when the police pulled
[2:20:36.760 --> 2:20:40.800]  me over two years ago and said, have you been drinking?
[2:20:40.800 --> 2:20:46.480]  I've been so committed to the truth that I said, yeah, I had a half bottle of wine,
[2:20:46.480 --> 2:20:52.520]  they arrested me, and it wasn't, I just couldn't lie anymore.
[2:20:52.520 --> 2:20:53.680]  I couldn't lie.
[2:20:53.680 --> 2:20:58.640]  And so I'm now to the point where my wife says, you like that woman, you really turned
[2:20:58.640 --> 2:21:02.360]  on by her, yeah, she's really hot, I can't help it.
[2:21:02.360 --> 2:21:09.800]  I tell the truth now, period, and it's just what I do, and let me tell you, when you train
[2:21:09.800 --> 2:21:16.600]  your brain, because when you lie, your brain calculates everything and then decides what
[2:21:16.600 --> 2:21:18.720]  the saying creates a false reality.
[2:21:18.720 --> 2:21:23.560]  And you stop lying, I've never been a big liar, I'd add like, you still 100 bucks
[2:21:23.560 --> 2:21:30.800]  on my wallet when I was 14, he goes, I go, yeah, I did, and we got in a fist fight.
[2:21:30.800 --> 2:21:37.160]  But the point is, is that I don't lie to you, and that's why they sit there, and they say
[2:21:37.160 --> 2:21:42.840]  that I'm a liar, and I'm a deceiver, because I'm the opposite of that.
[2:21:42.840 --> 2:21:46.600]  That's why I've told you horrible things about me, because I want you to know that I'm
[2:21:46.600 --> 2:21:48.000]  a sinner and I'm not perfect.
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:56.840]  Now, let me tell you something, there is nothing more frustrating, nothing in my life more frustrating
[2:21:56.840 --> 2:22:03.580]  than seeing the establishment write the laws and the regulations to help themselves and
[2:22:03.580 --> 2:22:10.880]  to not help you, and to have the government and the systems and the bureaucracies, the
[2:22:10.880 --> 2:22:16.720]  corporate bureaucracies, not tell you how it works, because if you want to bring down
[2:22:16.720 --> 2:22:21.480]  the system, you and replace it with a better one, not the horrible one they want to replace
[2:22:21.480 --> 2:22:27.240]  it with, because they're bringing it down, you need to know the tricks and what's going
[2:22:27.240 --> 2:22:32.080]  on, and you need to know how easy it is, and that's another giant frustration.
[2:22:32.080 --> 2:22:36.280]  We wouldn't be on air right now without good tax lawyers and good researchers.
[2:22:36.280 --> 2:22:40.360]  And I went through so many who will milk you and assess your business and lie when they
[2:22:40.360 --> 2:22:45.640]  have all the codes and can do it easily, like you're pulling into a fast food restaurant.
[2:22:45.640 --> 2:22:50.040]  And then they stand behind it, so their names on it, you're protected.
[2:22:50.040 --> 2:22:53.040]  They don't tell you that.
[2:22:53.040 --> 2:22:55.240]  So Tyler Bennett joins us.
[2:22:55.240 --> 2:23:01.080]  He is a tax professional lawyer, the owner proprietor of the Tax for America Tax Solutions.
[2:23:01.080 --> 2:23:04.600]  Incredible reviews, thousands of our listeners have used them the last three months.
[2:23:04.600 --> 2:23:09.520]  I've used them, families used them, that's why I went out and sought them out.
[2:23:09.520 --> 2:23:10.940]  But it is a no-brainer.
[2:23:10.940 --> 2:23:16.200]  There are millions of people listening right now, and when I have Tyler on, they get thousands
[2:23:16.200 --> 2:23:18.520]  of calls, and they're a big sponsor, and we love it.
[2:23:18.520 --> 2:23:25.080]  But there's no sponsorship better than promoting vitamin D or vitamin C or good iodine, because
[2:23:25.080 --> 2:23:28.880]  I know you need it, and it's great, and it funds us, and it's symbiotic, and I feel
[2:23:28.880 --> 2:23:30.440]  good doing it.
[2:23:30.440 --> 2:23:34.280]  But man, I'm telling you folks, everybody should write the number down, the website
[2:23:34.280 --> 2:23:38.080]  down, and should call them, and they've been so flooded, they got offices all over the
[2:23:38.080 --> 2:23:42.400]  U.S., a bit of their offices in L.A., huge, you know, hundreds of employees, lawyers,
[2:23:42.400 --> 2:23:44.080]  CPAs, you name it.
[2:23:44.080 --> 2:23:49.080]  They cut right to the chase, and they use the money you save on taxes and your business,
[2:23:49.080 --> 2:23:53.240]  or putting you in a new corporation to fund themselves and then fund us.
[2:23:53.240 --> 2:24:02.800]  So you win, they win, I win, that civilization symbiosis, symbiotic, living in harmony,
[2:24:02.800 --> 2:24:03.800]  living together.
[2:24:03.800 --> 2:24:05.800]  I want a relationship with you in 30 years.
[2:24:05.800 --> 2:24:09.640]  I want my children to have a relationship with your children in 50 years, our grandchildren
[2:24:09.640 --> 2:24:16.640]  in 80 years, our great-grandchildren in 100 years, you're saying, I am about victory and
[2:24:16.640 --> 2:24:22.840]  wholesomeness, and so I'm going to tell listeners, you are dumb, and I'm not being mean, I'm
[2:24:22.840 --> 2:24:25.800]  saying, you're stupid.
[2:24:25.800 --> 2:24:31.760]  You're giving in to Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates who pay no taxes, if you don't call, have
[2:24:31.760 --> 2:24:36.720]  them do an assessment, which is free, and then look at what you can do, because it's
[2:24:36.720 --> 2:24:40.760]  not just getting 90% of your tax debt forgiven, it's not just getting your passport unfrozen
[2:24:40.760 --> 2:24:41.760]  of your taxes.
[2:24:41.760 --> 2:24:46.600]  They got hundreds of services, it's bookkeeping, putting you in touch with the right people,
[2:24:46.600 --> 2:24:51.480]  business counseling, business entity selection, which you can save 20, 30% on just having
[2:24:51.480 --> 2:24:57.960]  the right corporation, business entity selection, estate and trust preparation, financial statements,

[2:25:25.680 --> 2:25:35.680]  jonestaxrelief.com, jonestaxrelief.com or 833-900-4285, jonestaxrelief.com or 833-900-4285.
[2:25:35.680 --> 2:25:44.440]  Power Minute, I've got nothing but rave reviews since you've been with us, and I'm glad when
[2:25:44.440 --> 2:25:47.320]  I came to you, you're a big listener, it was just amazing, it was a match made in heaven,
[2:25:47.320 --> 2:25:52.040]  but I want to break in three minutes, I want to give you the floor until we come back,
[2:25:52.040 --> 2:25:55.680]  but tax season's over, still a lot of folks are calling you, but this isn't even about
[2:25:55.680 --> 2:25:59.880]  tax season, you've got to do it early, the longer you guys have the more time, you can
[2:25:59.880 --> 2:26:04.640]  give people instant solutions, but getting ahead of this is so important, people must
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:10.680]  make this call, they must do this, it supports you, myself and them, most importantly they're
[2:26:10.680 --> 2:26:14.760]  going to love it, they can then use that extra money for their family, for their businesses,
[2:26:14.760 --> 2:26:19.680]  for their healthcare, for their travel and to buy products at m4sport.com, it is a perfect
[2:26:19.680 --> 2:26:22.160]  win-win, how do people do it?
[2:26:22.160 --> 2:26:28.080]  Alright Alex, well thanks for having me on again, and I am so grateful to the show and
[2:26:28.080 --> 2:26:33.240]  the info warriors out there, because this tax season alone, the last two weeks in April,
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:40.240]  we have saved a grand total, I had the accountants line it up of about $27 million in taxes
[2:26:40.240 --> 2:26:45.760]  that would have been paid, now why this is so awesome is because that's $20 million,
[2:26:45.760 --> 2:26:51.360]  from your listeners alone, and that's $27 million that would have gone to fund the globalist,
[2:26:51.360 --> 2:26:56.960]  the elitist, because we know the IRS is the collection agency of the evil empire, and
[2:26:56.960 --> 2:27:03.000]  that's $27 million not going to them, which instead can go to something that you believe
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:08.200]  in, the tithe for your church, maybe you want to support info wars, anything that you want
[2:27:08.200 --> 2:27:14.000]  to do instead of the people who we know want to put you in the ground, want to make you
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:18.600]  broke, want to take everything, your rights from you and everything else, the only way
[2:27:18.600 --> 2:27:20.480]  to do it is to keep that money in your pocket.
[2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:24.080]  You owe nothing, you will have nothing, and that's what's so frustrating is, it's legal,
[2:27:24.080 --> 2:27:28.480]  it's lawful, they wrote it, but no other lawyers or CPAs will tell you because they're part
[2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:30.400]  of the freaking club.
[2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:34.800]  They're part of the cabal because they're all making money together off the globalist,
[2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:39.160]  what we do here is we provide the same laws, the same loopholes that these people came
[2:27:39.160 --> 2:27:43.800]  up with, and provide it to the middle class, and anybody and anyone, your taxes, it's not
[2:27:43.800 --> 2:27:49.240]  too small, it's not too big, have a tax plan because your right as an American is to not
[2:27:49.240 --> 2:27:55.080]  pay the IRS, the evil empire, a cent more than you're legally obligated to, and we,
[2:27:55.080 --> 2:28:01.480]  the real war begins now, right now, because it's audit season, and the IRS is on war against
[2:28:01.480 --> 2:28:05.720]  people who take deductions, and they're on war against people who have crypto, and that's
[2:28:05.720 --> 2:28:10.240]  you, you need to give us a call right now, we'll make sure inflation, all this stuff,
[2:28:10.240 --> 2:28:14.400]  we'll talk about it in a bit, and how it's going to make your taxes go up unless you're
[2:28:14.400 --> 2:28:17.360]  in the proper entity setup going forward.
[2:28:17.360 --> 2:28:22.880]  It's more important than ever, and it just fills me with so much, I was so happy to see
[2:28:22.880 --> 2:28:27.680]  how much money we had saved, and not given it to the evil empire, because A, we're helping
[2:28:27.680 --> 2:28:32.920]  people, and B, we're preventing the new world order from happening as much as possible.
[2:28:32.920 --> 2:28:36.560]  That's right, that's right, Tyler Bennett, and Jesus said, my people, parents, for lack
[2:28:36.560 --> 2:28:41.880]  of knowledge, the Bible says knowledge is power, they don't want people to know this,
[2:28:41.880 --> 2:28:47.880]  we're here releasing the secrets of this, this is so important, key information straight

[2:29:02.960 --> 2:29:08.880]  by yours truly, with a little gold bar implanted in it, and on the back, it's got a hologram.
[2:29:08.880 --> 2:29:13.640]  There are only 25,000 of these in existence, and they'll never be made again.
[2:29:13.640 --> 2:29:17.480]  The bank that owns the mint that has started putting these out the last few years, just
[2:29:17.480 --> 2:29:23.200]  sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling
[2:29:23.200 --> 2:29:24.200]  these for.
[2:29:24.200 --> 2:29:28.480]  If you get three or more, you can get these at 50% off, and they fund the info war.

[2:31:57.080 --> 2:32:00.600]  Let's go ahead and take another call, let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee, welcome.
[2:32:00.600 --> 2:32:01.600]  Hello, Alex.
[2:32:01.600 --> 2:32:02.600]  Yes, Malcolm.
[2:32:02.600 --> 2:32:06.240]  All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get online.
[2:32:06.240 --> 2:32:11.360]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMail
[2:32:11.360 --> 2:32:17.080]  Vitality and Brainforce Plus, mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[2:32:17.080 --> 2:32:21.800]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works, it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[2:32:21.800 --> 2:32:27.360]  that have never been heated up, and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered
[2:32:27.360 --> 2:32:31.560]  versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong, this is like a very fine
[2:32:31.560 --> 2:32:36.600]  wine, in fact, each batch is different, sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay,
[2:32:36.600 --> 2:32:40.080]  people are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[2:32:40.080 --> 2:32:45.040]  This is how it is, it's how it works, so it's always good, it's just sometimes it's
[2:32:45.040 --> 2:32:49.960]  like super strong, but yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is
[2:32:49.960 --> 2:32:58.960]  it.
[2:32:58.960 --> 2:33:17.080]  The politicians, the politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom
[2:33:17.080 --> 2:33:26.880]  of choice, you don't, you have no choice, you have owners, they own you, they own everything,
[2:33:26.880 --> 2:33:30.920]  they own all the important land, they own and control the corporations, they've long
[2:33:30.920 --> 2:33:34.120]  since bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls,
[2:33:34.120 --> 2:33:37.600]  they got the judges in their back pockets, and they own all the big media companies
[2:33:37.600 --> 2:33:41.560]  so they control just about all the news and information you get to hear, they got you
[2:33:41.560 --> 2:33:49.520]  by the balls, they want obedient workers, obedient workers, people who are just smart
[2:33:49.520 --> 2:33:54.440]  enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs
[2:33:54.440 --> 2:33:59.120]  with a lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing
[2:33:59.120 --> 2:34:02.840]  pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they're coming for
[2:34:02.840 --> 2:34:09.120]  your social security money, so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[2:34:09.120 --> 2:34:12.040]  It's a big club, and you ain't in it.
[2:34:12.040 --> 2:34:17.680]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[2:34:17.680 --> 2:34:18.680]  You better believe it.
[2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:20.960]  So what specifically did they do?
[2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:24.760]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage, I've given
[2:34:24.760 --> 2:34:27.600]  to just so you understand, a lot of money.
[2:34:27.600 --> 2:34:30.640]  You and I are not in the big club.
[2:34:30.640 --> 2:34:35.320]  The owners of this country know the truth, it's called the American Dream, because you
[2:34:35.320 --> 2:34:38.400]  have to be asleep to believe it.
[2:34:38.400 --> 2:34:42.800]  But I'll tell you what, they don't want, they don't want a population of citizens capable
[2:34:42.800 --> 2:34:46.920]  of critical thinking, they don't want well informed, well educated people capable of
[2:34:46.920 --> 2:34:50.880]  critical thinking, they're not interested in that, that doesn't help them, that's against
[2:34:50.880 --> 2:34:51.880]  their interest.
[2:34:51.880 --> 2:34:52.880]  That's right.
[2:34:52.880 --> 2:34:58.160]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:34:58.160 --> 2:35:06.080]  All right, two weeks ago, Tyler Bennett of American Tax Solutions was on with us, and
[2:35:06.080 --> 2:35:09.320]  I was 100% honest with all of you.
[2:35:09.320 --> 2:35:12.480]  You're not going to get in the big club, and you don't want to be in their satanic big
[2:35:12.480 --> 2:35:13.480]  club.
[2:35:13.480 --> 2:35:18.320]  Bezos and the top globalist pay zero taxes, Musk is not part of their club, he had to
[2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:23.760]  pay $16 billion or whatever it was this year, but he's still a small part of what he has.
[2:35:23.760 --> 2:35:28.800]  They have special former Justice Department heads, they have three law firms, their own
[2:35:28.800 --> 2:35:32.960]  record, the old one was Arthur Anderson, but they got in trouble with Enron, so now it's
[2:35:32.960 --> 2:35:35.000]  these other ones, there's three of them.
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:39.760]  If you get them to sign off on your tax return, you pay zero taxes basically, and there's
[2:35:39.760 --> 2:35:44.840]  ways they do it, and they have you move it around through Ireland and other countries.
[2:35:44.840 --> 2:35:49.600]  You're not doing that, it doesn't matter whether you work at McDonald's, it doesn't matter
[2:35:49.600 --> 2:35:52.320]  whether you're a doctor, it doesn't matter whether you own a ranch, it doesn't matter
[2:35:52.320 --> 2:35:56.600]  whether you're in the FBI, it doesn't matter if you're a college professor, it doesn't
[2:35:56.600 --> 2:35:58.680]  matter if you're an auto mechanic.
[2:35:58.680 --> 2:36:04.160]  There are easy default things that the big corporations and the big HR blocks will not
[2:36:04.160 --> 2:36:11.200]  tell you about, and that there's groups that will sign on and say, we're defending this,
[2:36:11.200 --> 2:36:16.600]  this is kosher, and then they leave you alone, and so there's hundreds of ways to do it,
[2:36:16.600 --> 2:36:24.080]  but very simply, the type of corporation you have from 40% tax to 20, there's so many things
[2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:29.760]  and we wouldn't be here on air if I hadn't changed our tax strategy like four years ago.
[2:36:29.760 --> 2:36:33.040]  I was just going along with the main line deal, you're being totally screwed, we wouldn't
[2:36:33.040 --> 2:36:34.040]  even be here.
[2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:38.240]  So ladies and gentlemen, that's why I'm saying, I feel so good about pushing this because
[2:36:38.240 --> 2:36:44.320]  this is the Achilles heel, they've got a club that they leave loopholes and escape systems
[2:36:44.320 --> 2:36:50.240]  for themselves, so up at the top, the billionaires paint basically 5% or nothing, 5% is about
[2:36:50.240 --> 2:36:55.920]  the average, you can look it up, but if the general nouveau rich middle class working
[2:36:55.920 --> 2:37:03.280]  class knows this, you can save 10, 30, 40% a year easily, and it's so simple, but you've
[2:37:03.280 --> 2:37:09.440]  got to have lawyers and CPAs that aren't screwing you and that are patriots, and that's why
[2:37:09.440 --> 2:37:14.440]  we have American Tax Solutions, go to jonestaxrelief.com and we get the support from the members that
[2:37:14.440 --> 2:37:21.040]  go there and be part of this, and I'm telling you, they will scan what you've done, you'll
[2:37:21.040 --> 2:37:24.840]  take them a few days, a few weeks depending on how complex your business is, average
[2:37:24.840 --> 2:37:28.520]  person a few hours, and then they will give you recommendations that instantly make you
[2:37:28.520 --> 2:37:32.720]  money and save you money and then they just want a piece of that and they give us a piece
[2:37:32.720 --> 2:37:40.080]  and it's a win-win, you're insane if you do not do this, it is so frustrating that they
[2:37:40.080 --> 2:37:45.900]  have all these loopholes and escape patches and we won't use them, so do you get the super
[2:37:45.900 --> 2:37:51.440]  platinum diamond billionaire, no, this is as close as you can get, and Tyler, we talked
[2:37:51.440 --> 2:37:54.600]  about this on the phone the other day privately, repeat what you said to me, I mean, how close
[2:37:54.600 --> 2:38:00.480]  can you get the average person to where the globalist are in not paying taxes, and so
[2:38:00.480 --> 2:38:05.560]  again, as you're saying Alex, the globalist true game is a pay-to-play being part of their
[2:38:05.560 --> 2:38:14.200]  club thing, but all the tax codes since the beginning of the IRS were written to be as
[2:38:14.200 --> 2:38:19.440]  confusing and as confounding as possible, Albert Einstein, arguably one of the smartest
[2:38:19.440 --> 2:38:24.920]  people in history, said the hardest thing to understand in the world is the income tax.
[2:38:24.920 --> 2:38:29.640]  Well, the reason it's so hard to understand is because the lobbyists for the globalists
[2:38:29.640 --> 2:38:35.000]  have made it, unless you go to school for tax law, you know, for 10 years and study
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:40.440]  this stuff every year, how it changes the regulations, how the IRS can change the law
[2:38:40.440 --> 2:38:45.400]  without congressional approval, et cetera, et cetera, you're just going to fall behind.
[2:38:45.400 --> 2:38:49.320]  And so let me tell you something about the big box tax companies, if you've been paying
[2:38:49.320 --> 2:38:53.280]  attention since I've been on this program, I've been telling you they're evil in the
[2:38:53.280 --> 2:38:59.680]  watch out form, and now look it up, TurboTax has just got the class action lawsuit, they're
[2:38:59.680 --> 2:39:05.960]  being sued, they're giving $125 million back to people that use their services that they
[2:39:05.960 --> 2:39:10.920]  took advantage of, they said they'd help them save taxes, they took their money, they said
[2:39:10.920 --> 2:39:14.080]  they'd get them in tax plans, and they didn't perform, they just took their money, and so
[2:39:14.080 --> 2:39:18.120]  now they're giving it back, and it's true, they don't care about you because they're
[2:39:18.120 --> 2:39:24.200]  not a bespoke tax firm that cares about taxes, they're a pulp into it, is a publicly traded
[2:39:24.200 --> 2:39:28.640]  company, which means they care about two things, their bottom line and their shareholders,
[2:39:28.640 --> 2:39:32.760]  they sure as heck don't care about how much money you're saving on your taxes.
[2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:38.120]  That's where we come in, because I absolutely care how much you have on your taxes because
[2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:42.200]  it's a vested interest for me too, because I don't want those people to get your money,
[2:39:42.200 --> 2:39:44.640]  my money, or anyone else's, I want you to keep it.
[2:39:44.640 --> 2:39:49.440]  And let's be clear, it's all fiat, none of it runs the country, I've talked to top lawyers
[2:39:49.440 --> 2:39:55.880]  and others, they admit it's all for social engineering, none of this money runs anything.
[2:39:55.880 --> 2:40:01.360]  That's right, so I mean, listen, that's why it's your duty as a patriot, if you don't
[2:40:01.360 --> 2:40:05.600]  believe what the regime is doing is to pay them the least amount of possible, and here's
[2:40:05.600 --> 2:40:10.040]  where they're sneaky, okay, there was a poll that went out last month and they asked, what's
[2:40:10.040 --> 2:40:15.840]  the biggest issue affecting 94% of Americans answered inflation, okay?
[2:40:15.840 --> 2:40:20.080]  Inflation is going up so high, and I talk about this a lot, but it's kind of hard to
[2:40:20.080 --> 2:40:25.600]  explain, so let me simplify it, when inflation goes up and taxes are not adjusted, you are
[2:40:25.600 --> 2:40:31.640]  paying more in taxes, let me put it to you this way, let's say you have $1,000, okay,
[2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:36.280]  and this is what you're gonna owe in taxes, well, after inflation that's happened so far,
[2:40:36.280 --> 2:40:42.280]  you can get rid of $150, now you have your $1,000 is worth $850, and by the end of the
[2:40:42.280 --> 2:40:47.920]  year, guess what, it's gonna be worth closer to $700, and you're gonna have to make up
[2:40:47.920 --> 2:40:54.440]  that $300 deficiency, so that's how even though the Biden administration hasn't explicitly
[2:40:54.440 --> 2:40:58.760]  raised taxes, they're getting more and more of your money, through inflation.
[2:40:58.760 --> 2:41:05.480]  That's right, inflation is the ultimate tax, so everyone must use the loopholes now just
[2:41:05.480 --> 2:41:07.400]  to survive.
[2:41:07.400 --> 2:41:12.040]  That's exactly right, and if we look back in history, remember, inflation brought down
[2:41:12.040 --> 2:41:16.520]  the Roman Empire, but the globalists are not gonna be brought down, they're gonna let you
[2:41:16.520 --> 2:41:18.240]  be brought down by this.
[2:41:18.240 --> 2:41:23.160]  Don't let it happen, we need to get you in the proper tax plan, because we can foresee
[2:41:23.160 --> 2:41:26.320]  the way inflation is going to affect your taxes going forward, and make sure you're
[2:41:26.320 --> 2:41:31.840]  not paying a dime more than you need to, because remember, if you give the government money
[2:41:31.840 --> 2:41:37.800]  up front, it's interest-free loan, if you owe money, they absolutely will charge you
[2:41:37.800 --> 2:41:38.800]  interest.
[2:41:38.800 --> 2:41:42.720]  Well, Tyler, let's talk about that when we come back, because give people examples, again,
[2:41:42.720 --> 2:41:47.200]  they've written the tax code for themselves, their system won't tell the general public,
[2:41:47.200 --> 2:41:53.240]  it's all legal, all awful, and when they see a lawyer's name on it, it's your issue once
[2:41:53.240 --> 2:41:57.080]  you guys sign off on it, that's what's so valuable about this, I mean, it's just, it's
[2:41:57.080 --> 2:41:58.080]  a no-brainer.
[2:41:58.080 --> 2:42:02.160]  Well, I'm so frustrated that everybody should be doing this.
[2:42:02.160 --> 2:42:03.160]  Absolutely.
[2:42:03.160 --> 2:42:05.160]  Alright, we're gonna break.
[2:42:05.160 --> 2:42:06.160]  Yeah, that's...
[2:42:06.160 --> 2:42:07.160]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[2:42:07.160 --> 2:42:08.160]  Okay.
[2:42:08.160 --> 2:42:12.040]  Oh, I was just gonna say, that's absolutely correct, Alex, because the thing is, is, like
[2:42:12.040 --> 2:42:17.900]  you said before, it's not about people being dumb or stupid, it's about this country purposely
[2:42:17.900 --> 2:42:22.440]  gave you a lack of education in this department so they could take advantage of you.
[2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:26.040]  Do not let the globalists take advantage of you, that's my passion.
[2:42:26.040 --> 2:42:29.880]  It's just like the vaccines, we have all the numbers that's killing you, we have all the
[2:42:29.880 --> 2:42:34.120]  numbers that's on a vaccine, they don't know, people perish, that's why I'm so frustrated,
[2:42:34.120 --> 2:42:37.480]  I mean, it's, I remember like three, four years ago, wait, if I'm a different corporation
[2:42:37.480 --> 2:42:42.360]  I pay less, yeah, boom, we'd be shut down now if I hadn't done that, I mean, it's like,
[2:42:42.360 --> 2:42:47.640]  it's like, why didn't five tax firms tell me this, why didn't they, and then later it's
[2:42:47.640 --> 2:42:57.520]  totally kosher, man, I mean, it is just insane what they do to us, wow, we'll be right back.
[2:42:57.520 --> 2:43:03.520]  Here at Info Wars, our slogan is, tomorrow's news today, whether it's politics or health

[2:43:57.760 --> 2:44:03.800]  Our world is so full of hype, we are force fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate
[2:44:03.800 --> 2:44:09.360]  media, by the controlled churches and the universities, and why is this the case?
[2:44:09.360 --> 2:44:14.320]  Because we innately, by God, have been given the keys for our own minds, our own psyches,
[2:44:14.320 --> 2:44:21.040]  our own souls, and by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and transcend the quote
[2:44:21.040 --> 2:44:26.520]  fallen or sinful state, so the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring
[2:44:26.520 --> 2:44:32.480]  into our bodies to change who we are are only lowering us, they're only making us more
[2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:36.920]  depressed, in the end they're only making us less fulfilled, it is only by going within
[2:44:36.920 --> 2:44:41.160]  and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves.
[2:44:41.160 --> 2:44:45.680]  That's why the globalist bombardists and toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal
[2:44:45.680 --> 2:44:50.920]  vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to
[2:44:50.920 --> 2:44:54.920]  basically reach out beyond the third dimension, and that's where the incredible products come
[2:44:54.920 --> 2:44:57.400]  in at infowarsstore.com.
[2:44:57.400 --> 2:45:01.200]  We have over 100 designs of t-shirts that just sit there in our warehouse, we need to sell
[2:45:01.200 --> 2:45:06.040]  those shirts to fund the operation, but we'd already made some orders on future shirts
[2:45:06.040 --> 2:45:07.040]  coming in.
[2:45:07.040 --> 2:45:09.560]  But these are all limited editions, so once these new shirts come in we're going to sell
[2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:13.920]  those and that's it, we'll have limited editions one at a time in the future, and when they're
[2:45:13.920 --> 2:45:15.400]  gone they're gone.
[2:45:15.400 --> 2:45:20.280]  Well here's the new limited edition shirt, this one is $24.95, really nice fabric, Allie

[2:47:21.960 --> 2:47:37.960]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones. Infowars is the undisputed
[2:47:37.960 --> 2:47:46.520]  spirit animal, the worldwide liberty movement, and when I've got sure things, I get angry
[2:47:46.520 --> 2:47:52.680]  actually, because they've written the tax code and they've controlled all the lawyers
[2:47:52.680 --> 2:47:58.720]  and CPAs not to tell you what they're doing, and with social engineering, so they change
[2:47:58.720 --> 2:48:04.040]  the tax law every year or so, they're always ahead of things not paying any taxes, having
[2:48:04.040 --> 2:48:09.360]  you pay taxes to suppress you while they have all the fiat currency, learn what's happening,
[2:48:09.360 --> 2:48:16.680]  get an assessment, save massive money, win, be successful, be prosperous, that's what
[2:48:16.680 --> 2:48:22.080]  we're about, don't kill your children, don't depopulate, believe we're going to the stars,
[2:48:22.080 --> 2:48:26.360]  everything we do here is about wealth and strength, because we are not people given
[2:48:26.360 --> 2:48:34.560]  to fear, but a spirit of victory as the Bible says, go to jonestaxrelief.com, jonestaxrelief.com,

[2:48:47.440 --> 2:48:52.720]  of people, amazing, they are about action and cutting through the red tape and not milking

[2:49:13.640 --> 2:49:21.120]  it helps you and it funds the operation, that is where I just, everything I do has got to
[2:49:21.120 --> 2:49:25.560]  be a win-win, and this is the win-win of win-wins, all right, Tyler Bennett, we're going to go
[2:49:25.560 --> 2:49:28.880]  50 minutes to the next hour, Jay Dyer is going to take over, but you've got a lot of stories,
[2:49:28.880 --> 2:49:32.640]  a lot of reports, a lot of angles, a lot of examples of different types of businesses,
[2:49:32.640 --> 2:49:36.880]  but whether somebody, again, works at a grocery store or is a scientist or a billionaire or
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:40.720]  a millionaire, they need to talk to you guys, how do they do it, what are some of the services
[2:49:40.720 --> 2:49:43.720]  and what are some of the stories?
[2:49:43.720 --> 2:49:48.080]  That's right, Alex, so let's talk about the grocery store employee, I had a woman who
[2:49:48.080 --> 2:49:51.620]  worked at a grocery store that was paying her under the table, she was making some side
[2:49:51.620 --> 2:49:56.480]  income left and right a few weeks ago, come into my office and she knew, because she had
[2:49:56.480 --> 2:50:01.080]  heard me on the program before, say the IRS only knows what you or somebody else tell
[2:50:01.080 --> 2:50:02.080]  them, right?
[2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:05.600]  And so she said to me, well, hey, I don't want to report this income, what I had to
[2:50:05.600 --> 2:50:10.720]  tell her is, listen, the number one way the IRS is going to get you is that they catch
[2:50:10.720 --> 2:50:15.900]  you in a lie because tax evasion is illegal, and the only difference between that and tax
[2:50:15.900 --> 2:50:17.700]  avoidance is we find legal-
[2:50:17.700 --> 2:50:22.960]  I mean, this is so key, folks, the avoidance is in the law, don't do it illegally, don't
[2:50:22.960 --> 2:50:26.160]  let them, there's a legal way to do it, explain it.
[2:50:26.160 --> 2:50:27.160]  Exactly.
[2:50:27.160 --> 2:50:31.200]  So what she called me and wanted to do was say, hey, can I just keep all this off the
[2:50:31.200 --> 2:50:33.040]  books and we'll say I didn't make any money.
[2:50:33.040 --> 2:50:37.960]  I said, no, look, we're going to legally report this income and do it the correct way, and
[2:50:37.960 --> 2:50:39.760]  she didn't know any money anyways.
[2:50:39.760 --> 2:50:44.720]  If you do it correctly and you know what you're doing, and she's on a 1099, that's when you're
[2:50:44.720 --> 2:50:50.200]  the world's in your oyster for deductions and, you know, entities and all sorts of things.
[2:50:50.200 --> 2:50:54.240]  And if you're making too much money, we can always set up a side hustle because I don't
[2:50:54.240 --> 2:50:58.920]  know about you, but I'd rather you spend your money on something you enjoy than giving it
[2:50:58.920 --> 2:51:03.000]  to the globalists and giving it to Biden, to giving it to the elitists and the IRS.
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:04.560]  And so that's what it's about.
[2:51:04.560 --> 2:51:09.600]  We were able to, she reported all her income legally, and didn't owe a dime.
[2:51:09.600 --> 2:51:12.320]  Another example is on the TurboTax thing.
[2:51:12.320 --> 2:51:16.120]  I had a caller from your program again who said, hey, I had used TurboTax and they're
[2:51:16.120 --> 2:51:18.280]  saying I owe $20,000.
[2:51:18.280 --> 2:51:20.680]  This woman's 71 years old.
[2:51:20.680 --> 2:51:22.600]  And we said, we'll take a look at the returns.
[2:51:22.600 --> 2:51:26.520]  We did them, there was a glaring mistake because like I tell you at these big box stores, they're
[2:51:26.520 --> 2:51:30.160]  not attorneys, they're not even enrolled IRS agents, they're clerks.
[2:51:30.160 --> 2:51:35.160]  And so they missed a huge amount of deductions, she was, and miscalculated her income.
[2:51:35.160 --> 2:51:37.840]  And at the end of it, she got a refund, actually.
[2:51:37.840 --> 2:51:39.960]  So it's all about who's doing what they have.
[2:51:39.960 --> 2:51:42.400]  So again, instead of her paying $20,000, she got a refund.
[2:51:42.400 --> 2:51:47.880]  I mean, these globalists, you're a lawyer, not lawyers are bad, but the way they just
[2:51:47.880 --> 2:51:52.480]  hope people don't look into it or have lawyers like you to counter them.
[2:51:52.480 --> 2:51:53.480]  Exactly right, Alex.
[2:51:53.480 --> 2:51:58.760]  I mean, the way that I would put it is, if you go to the doctor and the doctor says there's
[2:51:58.760 --> 2:52:02.800]  something wrong with you, you're smart, you'll get a second opinion.
[2:52:02.800 --> 2:52:05.960]  But if the doctor says something, that's the way it is, right?
[2:52:05.960 --> 2:52:10.120]  And so a lot of these people, they say, well, TurboTax said this or my risk adverse accountant
[2:52:10.120 --> 2:52:12.840]  said this who really works for the IRS.
[2:52:12.840 --> 2:52:14.200]  And so they think that's it.
[2:52:14.200 --> 2:52:17.320]  I'm here telling you that is not the only option.
[2:52:17.320 --> 2:52:18.320]  Give us a call.
[2:52:18.320 --> 2:52:23.400]  You do not have to pay everything they're claiming because they tack all sorts of fees
[2:52:23.400 --> 2:52:25.160]  and different things that they want you to pay.
[2:52:25.160 --> 2:52:26.240]  They have to pay for Ukraine.
[2:52:26.240 --> 2:52:28.360]  They have to pay to make everyone go broke.
[2:52:28.360 --> 2:52:34.800]  And as soon as they know that they've got a major law for them, they back off quickly.
[2:52:34.800 --> 2:52:36.280]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:52:36.280 --> 2:52:37.280]  So check this out.
[2:52:37.280 --> 2:52:40.560]  This is a new thing that's just absolutely crazy.
[2:52:40.560 --> 2:52:45.320]  So we've known for the longest time that the IRS has been outsourcing debt collections
[2:52:45.320 --> 2:52:47.440]  to private collection agencies.
[2:52:47.440 --> 2:52:50.320]  This is something that just came across my desk the other day.
[2:52:50.320 --> 2:52:51.320]  This is from a law firm.
[2:52:51.320 --> 2:52:54.080]  I had to bleep out names, obviously.
[2:52:54.080 --> 2:53:00.360]  But this is from a law firm that the IRS has employed to collect a tax debt, a law firm
[2:53:00.360 --> 2:53:01.360]  up in Chicago.
[2:53:01.360 --> 2:53:02.620]  They're after a few clients.
[2:53:02.620 --> 2:53:10.440]  So the IRS is really, really stepping outside of their traditional legal boundaries because
[2:53:10.440 --> 2:53:14.360]  bills like this, which they wanted to pass where they're trying to monitor your bank
[2:53:14.360 --> 2:53:15.880]  account, haven't passed it.
[2:53:15.880 --> 2:53:17.600]  Does that mean they're not monitoring your bank account?
[2:53:17.600 --> 2:53:19.880]  Oh, they're finding other ways to do it.
[2:53:19.880 --> 2:53:23.000]  They're going through Department of Justice, especially crypto people.
[2:53:23.000 --> 2:53:24.000]  Pay attention.
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:29.080]  If you have any crypto, they will go through DOJ to say, hey, we need to monitor this person's
[2:53:29.080 --> 2:53:30.080]  account.
[2:53:30.080 --> 2:53:33.320]  We need to monitor this person's public addresses to see if there's any fraud going on.
[2:53:33.320 --> 2:53:34.520]  Is it really about fraud?
[2:53:34.520 --> 2:53:37.840]  No, it's they wanted to get the most amount of money from you as possible.
[2:53:37.840 --> 2:53:40.520]  You have to understand that this is what's happening.
[2:53:40.520 --> 2:53:41.520]  This is the world.
[2:53:41.520 --> 2:53:46.040]  The pipelines and everything, it's about suppressing us, they admit that.
[2:53:46.040 --> 2:53:47.040]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:53:47.040 --> 2:53:52.200]  So it's literally the listeners duty to save money and not pay the beast because you Biden
[2:53:52.200 --> 2:53:54.320]  said every American should be proud.
[2:53:54.320 --> 2:53:55.320]  You said this a month ago.
[2:53:55.320 --> 2:53:56.840]  I was like, oh, yeah, it's a good point.
[2:53:56.840 --> 2:54:01.160]  But now it's like you're like you're psychic, Tyler.
[2:54:01.160 --> 2:54:04.160]  You said you're paying for the Ukraine war.
[2:54:04.160 --> 2:54:05.160]  It's wrong.
[2:54:05.160 --> 2:54:07.200]  Biden said every American should be proud.
[2:54:07.200 --> 2:54:09.080]  You're paying for the war.
[2:54:09.080 --> 2:54:13.480]  Yeah, well, I'm not proud to be paying for a war that I don't care about.
[2:54:13.480 --> 2:54:15.680]  And I know no one else is either.
[2:54:15.680 --> 2:54:16.680]  Okay.
[2:54:16.680 --> 2:54:23.800]  And the thing is, is yes, it is your duty to pay the taxes you owe, not a penny more.
[2:54:23.800 --> 2:54:25.920]  That's the way that it was written.
[2:54:25.920 --> 2:54:29.160]  And so listen, we have a social contract pay taxes.
[2:54:29.160 --> 2:54:33.360]  It's nice to have police and stuff, but I don't want to pay them a dime more so they
[2:54:33.360 --> 2:54:35.080]  can promote their agenda.
[2:54:35.080 --> 2:54:39.960]  But police are paid by local taxes, police are paid by local tax, right?
[2:54:39.960 --> 2:54:41.040]  Absolutely.
[2:54:41.040 --> 2:54:48.200]  So the IRS is just the only thing they're doing is collecting it for their, you know,
[2:54:48.200 --> 2:54:51.120]  new world order and the things they want to do.
[2:54:51.120 --> 2:54:53.600]  So yes, the social contract exists.
[2:54:53.600 --> 2:54:55.040]  Do not pay them a dime more.
[2:54:55.040 --> 2:54:56.520]  It is not going to help you.
[2:54:56.520 --> 2:55:02.240]  In fact, some of the worst McDonald's you can save money, somebody that owns a string
[2:55:02.240 --> 2:55:03.240]  of restaurants.
[2:55:03.240 --> 2:55:04.240]  You can help.
[2:55:04.240 --> 2:55:06.000]  If you are, you're ready to help them right now.
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:09.960]  I know how you do it, but explain how do you guys cut to the chase with other law firms?
[2:55:09.960 --> 2:55:14.560]  There's some other governments as well and CPAs play games and milk you.
[2:55:14.560 --> 2:55:18.160]  I don't see why people don't just do what you're doing.
[2:55:18.160 --> 2:55:24.960]  So the name of the game since 2017, it's been five years is entity C corporation, depending
[2:55:24.960 --> 2:55:27.520]  on what you're set up for COVID relief.
[2:55:27.520 --> 2:55:33.680]  There are now bills have been put in place for self employed people to save 20% off the
[2:55:33.680 --> 2:55:34.680]  top.
[2:55:34.680 --> 2:55:38.240]  There's all these laws that they're not going to tell you about because it's for the people
[2:55:38.240 --> 2:55:39.840]  in the club again.
[2:55:39.840 --> 2:55:40.960]  But I know it.
[2:55:40.960 --> 2:55:45.800]  My attorneys here know it and our job and our passion is to make sure you're paying the
[2:55:45.800 --> 2:55:48.400]  least amount of tax possible because guess what?
[2:55:48.400 --> 2:55:52.640]  When you have that money in your pocket, you can use that to fight the globalist instead
[2:55:52.640 --> 2:55:53.640]  of giving it.
[2:55:53.640 --> 2:55:55.000]  Oh, that came out of the billboard group like 10 years ago.
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  They said, we got to make people poor so they can't oppose us.
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:55:59.640]  Money is independence and power.
[2:55:59.640 --> 2:56:01.560]  And again, they know the tricks.
[2:56:01.560 --> 2:56:02.760]  They don't want you to have the tricks.
[2:56:02.760 --> 2:56:04.880]  It's so simple.
[2:56:04.880 --> 2:56:09.520]  I would guess anybody that calls whether a retiree or whether they're wealthy, anybody
[2:56:09.520 --> 2:56:11.440]  that calls, you're going to be able to help them.
[2:56:11.440 --> 2:56:12.440]  Right.
[2:56:12.440 --> 2:56:15.640]  Because Alex, everyone's tax situation is unique.
[2:56:15.640 --> 2:56:17.840]  That doesn't mean you can't be helped.
[2:56:17.840 --> 2:56:18.840]  Everyone can be helped.
[2:56:18.840 --> 2:56:21.440]  And does that mean one size fits all?
[2:56:21.440 --> 2:56:22.440]  Absolutely not.
[2:56:22.440 --> 2:56:26.920]  That's why it's so confounding and confusing to the average person because we need to find
[2:56:26.920 --> 2:56:33.040]  a bespoke strategy for you, whether you are on Social Security, whether you are working
[2:56:33.040 --> 2:56:38.480]  at a W-2 job, whether you are a small business owner, whether you're Nuval Reesh, any of these
[2:56:38.480 --> 2:56:43.000]  things we can help you all because I guarantee you're paying too much taxes if you don't
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:48.200]  study it or have somebody in your corner that is, you know, that's why I hammer the
[2:56:48.200 --> 2:56:57.320]  nail outside of a jonestaxrelief.com or 833-900-4285 folks.
[2:56:57.320 --> 2:57:00.240]  You got a call and you've hired a lot more people.
[2:57:00.240 --> 2:57:04.480]  You already had a big firm across the country, but you're getting flooded this weekend.
[2:57:04.480 --> 2:57:05.480]  People leave their name and number.
[2:57:05.480 --> 2:57:07.880]  They're going to call them back on Monday, right?
[2:57:07.880 --> 2:57:14.600]  I am so happy that the info wars audience is they're flooding us and I am staffing up
[2:57:14.600 --> 2:57:19.640]  majorly because we're getting lots of calls, we will take it all and listen.
[2:57:19.640 --> 2:57:23.680]  Unlike the globalist tax companies, I say we'll take everybody.
[2:57:23.680 --> 2:57:28.280]  We don't care how much money or how little money you have, you deserve to not be taken
[2:57:28.280 --> 2:57:33.080]  advantage of by the government or the technocrats and that's where we come from.
[2:57:33.080 --> 2:57:34.080]  Unbelievable.
[2:57:34.080 --> 2:57:37.680]  Let's come back and talk about some of the breaking taxes and more ahead of Jay Dyer.
[2:57:37.680 --> 2:57:38.680]  Stay with us.

[2:58:55.680 --> 2:59:00.240]  caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[2:59:00.240 --> 2:59:02.240]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[2:59:48.320 --> 2:59:55.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:18.320 --> 3:00:32.320]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every mob tyranny over the
[3:00:32.320 --> 3:00:41.720]  mind of man, Thomas Jefferson, live from Austin, Texas broadcasting world wide, it's Alex
[3:00:41.720 --> 3:00:52.840]  Jones.
[3:00:52.840 --> 3:01:00.200]  For the remainder of 2022, food at home prices are predicted to increase between 5 and 6%
[3:01:00.200 --> 3:01:06.440]  and food away from home prices, restaurants are predicted to increase between 5.5 and
[3:01:06.440 --> 3:01:07.440]  6.5%.
[3:01:07.440 --> 3:01:13.200]  Earlier this year, the USDA predicted food prices would increase 5 and 6%.
[3:01:13.200 --> 3:01:18.760]  The price of meats like beef and chicken increased by 1% or more between February and March.
[3:01:18.760 --> 3:01:23.680]  McMullen says eggs used to be $1.29 a dozen for large eggs, but now?
[3:01:23.680 --> 3:01:26.760]  They're almost $3 a cart.
[3:01:26.760 --> 3:01:35.000]  30% of the world's wheat production, if that goes unplanted in the Ukraine and corn and
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:44.600]  other things, our world is very, it's a very tight balance and if we interrupt the food
[3:01:44.600 --> 3:01:49.840]  production we will have a food crisis, prices will go through the roof.
[3:01:49.840 --> 3:01:54.880]  We can afford it as a rich country, we're so abundant, but other countries unfortunately
[3:01:54.880 --> 3:01:59.560]  will not and we will be the last ones affected, but like Marie Antoinette said, let them eat
[3:01:59.560 --> 3:02:00.560]  cake.
[3:02:00.560 --> 3:02:06.440]  Meanwhile, dozens of food processing facilities have been damaged or destroyed in fires, plane
[3:02:06.440 --> 3:02:11.640]  crashes and other ominous incidents across the United States.
[3:02:11.640 --> 3:02:14.920]  Everybody's concerned, nobody knows what the future holds.
[3:02:14.920 --> 3:02:19.880]  Uncertainty consumes the employees of an eastern organ food processing plant, decimated by
[3:02:19.880 --> 3:02:22.160]  a fire earlier in the week.
[3:02:22.160 --> 3:02:28.440]  While gas prices pummel the middle class dining room table, the cost of fuel for agricultural
[3:02:28.440 --> 3:02:34.480]  aircraft that is used for planting crops has actually tripled since last year.
[3:02:34.480 --> 3:02:38.120]  Supply chain issues also making nitrogen fertilizers more expensive.
[3:02:38.120 --> 3:02:45.720]  Anywhere from say $2 to $300 to $1,000 more a load going across the country.
[3:02:45.720 --> 3:02:49.920]  Add that to already increasing prices due to inflation, supply chain issues and trucker
[3:02:49.920 --> 3:02:54.200]  shortages and that could all lead to sticker shock at grocery stores.
[3:02:54.200 --> 3:02:58.280]  Rents reach unsustainable levels nationwide.
[3:02:58.280 --> 3:03:04.040]  High demand problems in the housing industry is having a huge ripple effect on renters.
[3:03:04.040 --> 3:03:07.480]  With home prices soaring, it's forcing many people to rent.
[3:03:07.480 --> 3:03:11.240]  On average across the country, rent is up nearly 20 percent.
[3:03:11.240 --> 3:03:17.760]  In one Florida city, a woman's rent is going from $1,700 a month to $3,500 a month.
[3:03:17.760 --> 3:03:20.560]  There are several factors for the big increase.
[3:03:20.560 --> 3:03:25.080]  Mortgage rates are above 5 percent for the first time since 2010.
[3:03:25.080 --> 3:03:29.080]  Funding costs are high and that's in part because of supply chain issues.
[3:03:29.080 --> 3:03:34.560]  You would think that all of these simultaneous crises occurring within the United States
[3:03:34.560 --> 3:03:40.200]  would be met with the vigor of a deeply concerned United States president.
[3:03:40.200 --> 3:03:46.120]  But America is supposed to assume that this senile, useless, pervert, donning a jacked
[3:03:46.120 --> 3:03:51.920]  up bow tie is merely incompetent and somehow inherited this whole mess from the previous
[3:03:51.920 --> 3:03:54.960]  administration and a war a world away.
[3:03:54.960 --> 3:03:58.760]  I'm really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans with a lower
[3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:02.720]  approver ready than I have.
[3:04:02.720 --> 3:04:05.840]  I think ever since you've come into office, things are really looking up.
[3:04:05.840 --> 3:04:09.520]  You know, gas is up, rent is up, food is up, everything.
[3:04:09.520 --> 3:04:14.920]  No, it really has been a tough first year for you, Mr. President.
[3:04:14.920 --> 3:04:22.240]  This Nero 2.0-esque laugh by world government operative Joe Biden as America suffers from
[3:04:22.240 --> 3:04:28.480]  his handler's controlled folly while guided by the minions of globalization is a scene
[3:04:28.480 --> 3:04:31.400]  straight from the inner sanctum of Skeletor.
[3:04:31.400 --> 3:04:34.600]  We're coming back with a solution.
[3:04:34.600 --> 3:04:43.960]  We go down in history as the moment the gauntlet was thrown down as American Providence was
[3:04:43.960 --> 3:04:48.720]  officially challenged and treason hit the boiling point.
[3:04:48.720 --> 3:04:49.720]  John Bowne reporting.
[3:04:49.720 --> 3:04:50.720]  This is a war.
[3:04:50.720 --> 3:04:51.720]  Be aware of the war and win.
[3:04:51.720 --> 3:05:04.360]  Over the years, Info Wars has produced more than 200 amazing Patriot Americana, Second
[3:05:04.360 --> 3:05:09.720]  Amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts, ball caps, flags, you name it.
[3:05:09.720 --> 3:05:13.560]  All of the apparel and the flags are being sold at cost right now.
[3:05:13.560 --> 3:05:19.840]  These are regular plain chain shirts that is all sorts of designer shirts that cost
[3:05:19.840 --> 3:05:21.840]  us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[3:05:21.840 --> 3:05:25.520]  We used to sell for $40, we're selling them for $15, selling them for $20.
[3:05:25.520 --> 3:05:30.040]  Whatever the shirt costs us, if a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5 for us to actually
[3:05:30.040 --> 3:05:31.040]  produce.
[3:05:31.040 --> 3:05:33.040]  It costs $10, we're selling it for $10.
[3:05:33.040 --> 3:05:36.560]  We've got hoodies, and we've got long sleeves, and we've got short sleeves, and we've got
[3:05:36.560 --> 3:05:41.000]  them all, and we've got to liquidate them all, and they're limited edition because we're
[3:05:41.000 --> 3:05:43.880]  never going to make any of these designs again.
[3:05:43.880 --> 3:05:48.000]  We are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited, and limited edition in
[3:05:48.000 --> 3:05:49.000]  the future.
[3:05:49.000 --> 3:05:53.800]  We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air, plus it spreads the word, infowarstore.com,
[3:05:53.800 --> 3:06:11.600]  your historic apparel now, infowarstore.com.
[3:06:11.600 --> 3:06:18.080]  Live from Austin, Texas, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex
[3:06:18.080 --> 3:06:19.080]  Jones.
[3:06:19.080 --> 3:06:23.960]  We've got one more caller who held Kyle in New York, we're going to at the end of the
[3:06:23.960 --> 3:06:25.840]  segment, but I want to finish up with Tyler Bennett.
[3:06:25.840 --> 3:06:31.040]  Tyler, it's so frustrating to know the tricks of the New World Order, and to see the general
[3:06:31.040 --> 3:06:34.400]  public just go, well, that's what they do, I'm going to keep being abused.
[3:06:34.400 --> 3:06:39.520]  It is so simple, the tax code is written to bankrupt the general population, just like
[3:06:39.520 --> 3:06:44.800]  the fentanyl, and the open borders, and the inflation, and the regulations, and the carbon
[3:06:44.800 --> 3:06:50.040]  taxes, and everything, and if people would just legally and lawfully know the loopholes
[3:06:50.040 --> 3:06:51.640]  that are written, it became over.
[3:06:51.640 --> 3:06:55.880]  That's why the main CPAs and lawyers don't tell people all this, because they're part
[3:06:55.880 --> 3:06:59.040]  of the club and it's not supposed to be given to the general public.
[3:06:59.040 --> 3:07:04.200]  The general public is seen as the target, as the schmucks know we are the people, we
[3:07:04.200 --> 3:07:08.480]  are the power, with this inflation, and the crime exploding, all of it, we've got to get
[3:07:08.480 --> 3:07:13.040]  prepared and ready, and that's where JonesTaxRelief.com comes in with your great company, American
[3:07:13.040 --> 3:07:21.400]  Tax Solutions, but here it is, L-A-D-A, Big Soros Communists will not bring felony charges
[3:07:21.400 --> 3:07:28.400]  against our man who tried to tackle and stab to death Dave Chapelle on video.
[3:07:28.400 --> 3:07:33.800]  They are encouraging this violence, and this breakdown of civilization, another sign of
[3:07:33.800 --> 3:07:40.600]  that, literally tries to stab and Dave Chapelle moves, they barely missed him, they now confirm,
[3:07:40.600 --> 3:07:46.680]  they don't even, I mean, this is to destroy confidence and bankrupt everybody so they
[3:07:46.680 --> 3:07:48.400]  can buy us up for pennies in the dollar.
[3:07:48.400 --> 3:07:52.440]  Our job is to keep the economy going and be successful and not implode what they want
[3:07:52.440 --> 3:08:00.820]  us to, and that's where people calling JonesTaxRelief.com or going to the site, and it's so easy, what's
[3:08:00.820 --> 3:08:06.720]  frustrating is, it's 100% a win-win if people just do it, that's why I'm so angry, because
[3:08:06.720 --> 3:08:10.720]  I know there's like 3 million people watching or listening right now, and a few thousand
[3:08:10.720 --> 3:08:15.800]  will call you, they all need to call you and stop being in the trance, stop being the
[3:08:15.800 --> 3:08:20.440]  sheeple, stop going along with the lies, because it's just as big as the poison shots or just
[3:08:20.440 --> 3:08:26.160]  as big as the brainwashing in public schools, this is something everybody needs to do, so
[3:08:26.160 --> 3:08:31.640]  you got six, seven minutes closing comments for TV viewers and radio listeners.
[3:08:31.640 --> 3:08:38.720]  Absolutely, Alex, well, let me just say this, is the crime and the allowance of crime, such
[3:08:38.720 --> 3:08:43.840]  as in California, now they're, you know, it's not in the ballot, it's been accepted in certain
[3:08:43.840 --> 3:08:49.160]  places that theft is not a felony unless it reaches a ridiculous amount of money, used
[3:08:49.160 --> 3:08:54.600]  to be $99, now it's a thousand, right, which means there's mom and pop shops that can't
[3:08:54.600 --> 3:08:59.480]  even call the police to get criminals out of their store and store, and why does this
[3:08:59.480 --> 3:09:05.160]  exist is the trifecta, they want you to be scared while taking your guns away and taking
[3:09:05.160 --> 3:09:10.640]  your money away so that you'll be 100% dependent on the government, and that's what it's about.
[3:09:10.640 --> 3:09:13.240]  So let's talk about some of these things that are happening.
[3:09:13.240 --> 3:09:18.840]  One is the changes in digital assets, okay, we do know the Biden administration has been
[3:09:18.840 --> 3:09:26.160]  trying to tax the heck and make super transparent the whole crypto thing, right, and if you
[3:09:26.160 --> 3:09:31.840]  have crypto, we know it's complicated, there's DeFi, there's all sorts of ways to make money
[3:09:31.840 --> 3:09:41.680]  in crypto, and right now, the tax law is nebulous because the IRS lost a Supreme Court case
[3:09:41.680 --> 3:09:46.480]  that crypto investors took up in regards to staking, and we can use this to our advantage.
[3:09:46.480 --> 3:09:51.280]  Biden absolutely will make the law so that you're gonna have to pay everything, but right
[3:09:51.280 --> 3:09:55.720]  now, we can treat staking income as capital gains, and there's other things we can do
[3:09:55.720 --> 3:10:00.560]  wash, wash sale rules, these are loopholes exist only in the crypto world that are going
[3:10:00.560 --> 3:10:03.320]  to be taken away.
[3:10:03.320 --> 3:10:07.800]  We got to the end of the year, and we need to use this stuff now because Biden has death
[3:10:07.800 --> 3:10:14.000]  that he's gonna get rid of it, and as I showed you before, the IRS is not necessarily gonna
[3:10:14.000 --> 3:10:17.200]  wait for the law to say they can do it.
[3:10:17.200 --> 3:10:22.880]  They will use other administrative agencies, the Department of Justice, or whoever else
[3:10:22.880 --> 3:10:27.680]  they have access to their private collection agencies, now these law firms to do their
[3:10:27.680 --> 3:10:35.080]  dirty work while sidestepping the law, because to sue the IRS, you have to sue them in federal
[3:10:35.080 --> 3:10:39.480]  court, that's expensive, that's the kind of thing we do when they're violating your rights,
[3:10:39.480 --> 3:10:44.560]  but the average person is not set up for that, they don't have the funds to supply something
[3:10:44.560 --> 3:10:45.560]  like that.
[3:10:45.560 --> 3:10:47.760]  And let's explain, people aren't gonna get with you to get teed up for that, when they
[3:10:47.760 --> 3:10:52.120]  see a major law firm that's behind them and doing legal lawful stuff, they just move on,
[3:10:52.120 --> 3:10:54.520]  they move on to people that don't know their rights.
[3:10:54.520 --> 3:10:56.280]  Absolutely, Alex.
[3:10:56.280 --> 3:11:01.600]  Let me explain to the viewers out there that the IRS, if you've ever had the misfortune
[3:11:01.600 --> 3:11:05.840]  of calling the IRS or dealing with one of their employees, you'll know you're not dealing
[3:11:05.840 --> 3:11:10.120]  with an attorney, you're not dealing with an enrolled IRS agent, you are dealing with
[3:11:10.120 --> 3:11:16.720]  a clerk that has been, took a two or four week training period on what the law is.
[3:11:16.720 --> 3:11:22.040]  You trust their decisions, I don't, because I've seen them violate people's rights time
[3:11:22.040 --> 3:11:23.160]  and time again.
[3:11:23.160 --> 3:11:27.080]  And these are not all bad people, they just don't know the law, and we need to tell them
[3:11:27.080 --> 3:11:31.360]  what the law is, and once we assert that, you think they're gonna go to their manager
[3:11:31.360 --> 3:11:34.920]  and say, whoops, I was violating the law, nope, they're gonna roll over and claim-
[3:11:34.920 --> 3:11:37.640]  That's right, so you eat, drink, and sleep, I talk to you, you work in seven days a week,
[3:11:37.640 --> 3:11:41.840]  Tyler Bennett, you eat, drink, and sleep, you know how to cut right to the chase with
[3:11:41.840 --> 3:11:45.720]  people and just save them money and get a percentage of it, that's why there's not the
[3:11:45.720 --> 3:11:51.000]  red tape, not the lawyers, not the bureaucracy, why, why doesn't the rest of the industry
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:52.000]  do this?
[3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:55.240]  I guess, because they've been directed not to give people the secrets.
[3:11:55.240 --> 3:12:02.440]  Well, that's just the, the awful truth of it, Alex, is the cabal at the top, they want
[3:12:02.440 --> 3:12:07.600]  to keep all of us paying their taxes, and that's how they can escape by paying nothing.
[3:12:07.600 --> 3:12:09.960]  And let's expand on that.
[3:12:09.960 --> 3:12:15.320]  Listeners need to call you because they don't know their situation, it needs to be assessed,
[3:12:15.320 --> 3:12:19.040]  you don't know folks, but you're saying basically in every case, you just save people money
[3:12:19.040 --> 3:12:20.600]  right away.
[3:12:20.600 --> 3:12:26.200]  Absolutely, everybody graduated high school in college, and guess what, you went out into
[3:12:26.200 --> 3:12:30.120]  the working world and you had to fill out taxes, probably even before you graduated
[3:12:30.120 --> 3:12:33.880]  high school, and you never knew what you were doing, and you fumbled your way through it,
[3:12:33.880 --> 3:12:34.880]  right?
[3:12:34.880 --> 3:12:38.480]  And, and that's the problem, and that's why you hire some company to do it that doesn't
[3:12:38.480 --> 3:12:42.360]  have your back, but knows that you don't know what's going on, and they know they can take
[3:12:42.360 --> 3:12:43.360]  advantage of you.
[3:12:43.360 --> 3:12:52.600]  That's why everybody needs to write down josetaxrelief.com, josetaxrelief.com or 833-904-285, and call on
[3:12:52.600 --> 3:12:56.680]  Friday today while we're live, call this weekend, leave your name and number, call next Monday,
[3:12:56.680 --> 3:13:01.840]  but seriously folks, this is such a no-brainer, and I hate the globalists, and I don't want
[3:13:01.840 --> 3:13:05.320]  them impoverishing you and controlling you, I want you to know they wrote these loopholes
[3:13:05.320 --> 3:13:09.040]  that are legal and lawful, if you don't take advantage of us, then you kind of deserve
[3:13:09.040 --> 3:13:12.760]  what they're doing, and I'm not trying to be mean there, this is just a no-brainer.
[3:13:12.760 --> 3:13:16.920]  josetaxrelief.com, Tyler Bennett, 30-second closing comment.
[3:13:16.920 --> 3:13:24.000]  Remember, when you pay more than you owe in taxes, you are supporting the globalists.
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:30.120]  That money is going to Ukraine per Joe Biden, so, hey, the least amount is possible because
[3:13:30.120 --> 3:13:36.080]  then you can give that money to your church, your charity, info wars, whoever you want
[3:13:36.080 --> 3:13:41.280]  the money to go to, because stop supporting people who hate you and want to bring you
[3:13:41.280 --> 3:13:42.280]  down.
[3:13:42.280 --> 3:13:43.280]  That's beautiful.
[3:13:43.280 --> 3:13:47.440]  Tyler Bennett, josetaxrelief.com, American Tax Solutions, thank you so much.
[3:13:47.440 --> 3:13:50.360]  Wow, so important, so incredible.
[3:13:50.360 --> 3:13:53.840]  Sunday show, 4 p.m. this weekend, I'll be here, I'll insure you and others, but right
[3:13:53.840 --> 3:13:56.640]  now, let's take a final call ahead of the great Jay Dyer.
[3:13:56.640 --> 3:13:59.640]  Let's talk to Kyle in New York, Kyle, thanks for holding.
[3:13:59.640 --> 3:14:05.480]  Alex, it's been a pleasure to hold this long and talk to you first, I want to say happy
[3:14:05.480 --> 3:14:10.800]  Mother's Day to your mom, my mom, and all the mothers of the info warriors out there,
[3:14:10.800 --> 3:14:14.800]  without them, no matter what Katanji Brown, Jackson, we salute the goddess, we salute
[3:14:14.800 --> 3:14:15.800]  our mothers, yes.
[3:14:15.800 --> 3:14:19.600]  Amen, amen, and praise Jesus Christ as well.
[3:14:19.600 --> 3:14:23.800]  Oh, I didn't mean that religious when I said goddess, I meant just the women are awesome.
[3:14:23.800 --> 3:14:28.080]  No, of course not, no, but they are, they are wonderful souls, they're angels, that's
[3:14:28.080 --> 3:14:30.800]  what they are, that's what the mothers are.
[3:14:30.800 --> 3:14:35.880]  This whole thing's been planned, I started watching you after you were on rogue in during
[3:14:35.880 --> 3:14:39.480]  election night, I'm sure you've heard that repetitively by now.
[3:14:39.480 --> 3:14:46.680]  But I just wanted to know if worst case scenario, because I know you, you repeated a lot.
[3:14:46.680 --> 3:14:50.760]  I think we have the globalists right where we want them, I think they're losing, but
[3:14:50.760 --> 3:14:52.960]  they're talking about speeding this up.
[3:14:52.960 --> 3:14:59.800]  Could it be before 2028 election, 2024 election, I have a whole list of just propaganda that
[3:14:59.800 --> 3:15:00.800]  they filled out.
[3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:01.800]  I mean,
[3:15:01.800 --> 3:15:04.280]  Oh, they're going to everybody ready for new bio attacks wars.
[3:15:04.280 --> 3:15:08.040]  I mean, I think it might be before the midterms, I mean, they're just launching everything.
[3:15:08.040 --> 3:15:11.760]  They're 186 days out from that brother, your guess is as good as mine, but they have made
[3:15:11.760 --> 3:15:15.800]  a test that are already all out war against us, while being aware of the fact that the
[3:15:15.800 --> 3:15:17.320]  bad guys are so key.
[3:15:17.320 --> 3:15:18.320]  Exactly.
[3:15:18.320 --> 3:15:22.920]  One of the things that I wanted to ask you though, an Owen had covered the first Pfizer
[3:15:22.920 --> 3:15:26.840]  dump with the nine pages of adverse reactions that he pulled up the graph.
[3:15:26.840 --> 3:15:30.080]  The reporting initially said 3% mortality rate.
[3:15:30.080 --> 3:15:32.080]  There's two groups that have to be removed from that.
[3:15:32.080 --> 3:15:36.880]  And when you remove the unknown group and also the not recovered at the time of reporting
[3:15:36.880 --> 3:15:45.680]  group, the possibility of mortality after it's 49.24% German top German scientists saying
[3:15:45.680 --> 3:15:46.680]  it's over 40%.
[3:15:46.680 --> 3:15:47.680]  Absolutely.
[3:15:47.680 --> 3:15:48.680]  God bless you, Kyle.
[3:15:48.680 --> 3:15:53.040]  Thanks for holding J. Dyer takes over right now the war room in 45 minutes with Owen Shroyer.
[3:15:53.040 --> 3:15:56.960]  Stay with us.
[3:15:56.960 --> 3:16:01.560]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying
[3:16:01.560 --> 3:16:06.880]  and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[3:16:06.880 --> 3:16:10.080]  And when it comes to information, boys, that's true today.
[3:16:10.080 --> 3:16:17.200]  We see the entire global corrupt into human depopulation, great reset combine, trying to
[3:16:17.200 --> 3:16:23.800]  collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing
[3:16:23.800 --> 3:16:30.280]  the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[3:16:30.280 --> 3:16:36.360]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID area, their world's gonna end in 2030, carbon
[3:16:36.360 --> 3:16:39.000]  tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[3:16:39.000 --> 3:16:40.560]  And none of it can succeed.
[3:16:40.560 --> 3:16:46.240]  None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[3:16:46.240 --> 3:16:49.920]  That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[3:16:49.920 --> 3:16:54.160]  And that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and band up video links.
[3:16:54.160 --> 3:16:56.520]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[3:16:56.520 --> 3:17:00.240]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported info wars financially with
[3:17:00.240 --> 3:17:02.200]  word of mouth and prayer.
[3:17:02.200 --> 3:17:05.600]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[3:17:05.600 --> 3:17:10.160]  caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[3:17:10.160 --> 3:17:12.160]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[3:17:12.160 --> 3:17:16.640]  I just want to thank you all for buying products and info wars.com like books and films and
[3:17:16.640 --> 3:17:19.880]  supplements and water filtration, air filtration so much more.

[3:17:40.560 --> 3:17:44.280]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support freedom to take action
[3:17:44.280 --> 3:17:48.720]  now as part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's countering the great

[3:17:54.120 --> 3:17:55.120]  Thank you so much for your support.
[3:17:55.120 --> 3:17:56.120]  Please take action.
[3:17:56.120 --> 3:18:00.400]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand info wars.
[3:18:00.400 --> 3:18:04.720]  I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little
[3:18:04.720 --> 3:18:05.720]  local radio show.
[3:18:05.720 --> 3:18:09.400]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge
[3:18:09.400 --> 3:18:10.400]  the globalists.
[3:18:10.400 --> 3:18:15.640]  And it was a t-shirt I designed the first one, mass murderers agree gun control works
[3:18:15.640 --> 3:18:18.920]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew.
[3:18:18.920 --> 3:18:21.720]  That's our oldest design and we're still selling.
[3:18:21.720 --> 3:18:26.280]  We have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions because
[3:18:26.280 --> 3:18:31.320]  whatever stock we've got in, that's it, we're selling everything out to find the operation
[3:18:31.320 --> 3:18:32.320]  to get rid of inventory.
[3:18:32.320 --> 3:18:36.000]  We'll still have some teachers in the future, they'll just be limited editions and short
[3:18:36.000 --> 3:18:37.000]  runs.
[3:18:37.000 --> 3:18:40.320]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[3:18:40.320 --> 3:18:45.520]  I almost forgot, we're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[3:18:45.520 --> 3:18:51.240]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts,
[3:18:51.240 --> 3:18:56.520]  designer shirts, they're all selling at cost, infowarstore.com.
[3:18:56.520 --> 3:18:59.920]  We have over a hundred designs of t-shirts that just sit there in our warehouse.
[3:18:59.920 --> 3:19:04.760]  We need to sell those shirts to fund the operation, but we'd already made some orders on future
[3:19:04.760 --> 3:19:05.760]  shirts coming in.
[3:19:05.760 --> 3:19:08.680]  But these are all limited editions, so once these new shirts come in, we're going to sell
[3:19:08.680 --> 3:19:09.680]  those and that's it.
[3:19:09.680 --> 3:19:14.040]  We'll have limited editions one at a time in the future and when they're gone, they're
[3:19:14.040 --> 3:19:15.040]  gone.
[3:19:15.040 --> 3:19:16.560]  So here's a new limited edition shirt.
[3:19:16.560 --> 3:19:21.600]  This one is $24.95, a really nice fabric, Alex Jones was right on the front with a big

[3:19:57.880 --> 3:20:11.040]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:11.040 --> 3:20:17.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:20:17.000 --> 3:20:21.680]  You know, I discovered something really wild in the last couple of weeks reading and doing
[3:20:21.680 --> 3:20:28.880]  some research that I thought I woke up this morning and I had a dream about it actually.
[3:20:28.880 --> 3:20:35.360]  And I don't typically do the four-tile of the Alex Jones show based on dreams and premonitions
[3:20:35.360 --> 3:20:40.960]  I had, but this time I had to because, I mean, if I did, it would be like crazy stuff, like
[3:20:40.960 --> 3:20:42.120]  how to fly or whatever.
[3:20:42.120 --> 3:20:50.240]  But no, today we're going to be talking about Tolkien and C.S. Lewis because I realized through
[3:20:50.240 --> 3:20:56.600]  reading C.S. Lewis's space trilogy, which is an overlooked dystopian story that has
[3:20:56.600 --> 3:21:00.800]  actually redemptive Christian themes, I think that's why it's overlooked is that you can't
[3:21:00.800 --> 3:21:06.320]  have a Christian-themed dystopian story nowadays, you got to have things that are really nihilistic
[3:21:06.320 --> 3:21:07.320]  and depressing.
[3:21:07.320 --> 3:21:11.520]  I mean, I think Brave New World in 1984 are great books, but they don't leave you with
[3:21:11.520 --> 3:21:12.520]  much hope.
[3:21:12.520 --> 3:21:18.880]  And the thing with C.S. Lewis's space trilogy is that he brings in the, not just the spiritual
[3:21:18.880 --> 3:21:24.280]  warfare satanic element of what we're undergoing in these days, but he also brings in the redemptive
[3:21:24.280 --> 3:21:25.760]  hope aspect of it.
[3:21:25.760 --> 3:21:29.960]  But before I get to that, I want to kind of rewind and understand where we are in the
[3:21:29.960 --> 3:21:31.600]  long term here, right?
[3:21:31.600 --> 3:21:36.360]  Remember in the French Revolution, according to Dr. Quigley, there were different banking
[3:21:36.360 --> 3:21:42.640]  interests that had put money into a giant revolution in France that would re-institute
[3:21:42.640 --> 3:21:45.360]  what they call year zero.
[3:21:45.360 --> 3:21:51.360]  So when we hear the term great reset, you should keep in mind that it really is the same basic
[3:21:51.360 --> 3:21:55.520]  plan going back to the French Revolution.
[3:21:55.520 --> 3:22:03.320]  The French Revolutionaries wanted to instantiate an ideal perfect republic based around pure
[3:22:03.320 --> 3:22:04.720]  reason.
[3:22:04.720 --> 3:22:09.800]  So the goddess reason was exalted at this time, they didn't really believe in a goddess,
[3:22:09.800 --> 3:22:18.800]  but they thought that the goddess reason symbolized the new order, the new global international
[3:22:18.800 --> 3:22:21.920]  order should be arranged around.
[3:22:21.920 --> 3:22:26.400]  And what this led to was a lot of frustration on the part of these insane foaming at the
[3:22:26.400 --> 3:22:31.440]  mouth revolutionaries who, when they couldn't get society to operate on a perfectly mathematical
[3:22:31.440 --> 3:22:36.200]  rational basis, why you have to kill everybody, everybody that doesn't go along with it off
[3:22:36.200 --> 3:22:38.720]  with their head.
[3:22:38.720 --> 3:22:44.560]  And this led to the creation of the Committee for Public Safety, which is estimated to have
[3:22:44.560 --> 3:22:48.600]  beheaded tens of thousands of people in the French Revolution.
[3:22:48.600 --> 3:22:52.800]  Now the reason this is relevant today is because I was just reminded by my buddy Tristan when
[3:22:52.800 --> 3:22:57.160]  he was covering the book, Fire in the Minds of Men, which is by James Billington, who
[3:22:57.160 --> 3:23:00.600]  is kind of the historian of revolutionary thought.
[3:23:00.600 --> 3:23:06.840]  He was a Library of Congress historian and in that book he talks about how the revolutionary
[3:23:06.840 --> 3:23:10.880]  faith from the time of the French Revolution onward is a faith.
[3:23:10.880 --> 3:23:18.680]  It's a belief in the ability to perfect man, to overcome man and to create a utopian society.
[3:23:18.680 --> 3:23:22.840]  And for the revolutionary, what always stands in the way of the perfect utopian society
[3:23:22.840 --> 3:23:30.120]  is the traditional ideas, conservative ideas, the ideas of God, the ideas of family, these
[3:23:30.120 --> 3:23:34.720]  things end up being stumbling blocks in their view through the creation of the utopia.
[3:23:34.720 --> 3:23:38.200]  So they locate evil within the created order.
[3:23:38.200 --> 3:23:43.280]  Evil is always some existing thing, like a family or a government, as if evil itself
[3:23:43.280 --> 3:23:46.840]  had existences, if it was something over there, and not a moral problem.
[3:23:46.840 --> 3:23:50.840]  So the first of all, revolutionaries have what we could call a Pelagian view that they
[3:23:50.840 --> 3:23:55.400]  don't think, they think that you can perfect man or you can fix man through external means.
[3:23:55.400 --> 3:24:00.160]  They don't understand that man's problem is his own fallen heart, his own passions, his
[3:24:00.160 --> 3:24:01.160]  own desires.
[3:24:01.160 --> 3:24:02.800]  It's not something out there in the world.
[3:24:02.800 --> 3:24:06.400]  There's evil people, but people aren't evil in themselves.
[3:24:06.400 --> 3:24:13.040]  But you have this sort of Gnostic idea amongst revolutionaries that the overcoming and creating
[3:24:13.040 --> 3:24:17.840]  of a utopia requires the destruction of everything that came before, and that was something that
[3:24:17.840 --> 3:24:22.480]  the French revolutionaries were adamant about.
[3:24:22.480 --> 3:24:26.440]  Now you're going to be blown away when we get to the Lewis and Tolkien part, because
[3:24:26.440 --> 3:24:32.400]  I was blown away this last week or so reading this, and it just occurred to me, if I coalesced
[3:24:32.400 --> 3:24:36.920]  like what Lewis and Tolkien were writing about.
[3:24:36.920 --> 3:24:40.600]  And I'd actually done an episode of my TV show from a few years ago, I had a TV show
[3:24:40.600 --> 3:24:45.160]  where we decoded movies, and we did two episodes on Lord of the Rings, and I thought at that
[3:24:45.160 --> 3:24:49.640]  time, well, it's a warning about technocracy, but it's way more than that.
[3:24:49.640 --> 3:24:54.000]  And I didn't even realize that back at the time, and I went and watched a bunch of professors
[3:24:54.000 --> 3:25:00.880]  and people doing lectures on Tolkien and Lewis, and even those guys couldn't figure out what
[3:25:00.880 --> 3:25:02.800]  these books are really about.
[3:25:02.800 --> 3:25:08.680]  But if you read the space trilogy, and if you read Tolkien together, his trilogy, they're
[3:25:08.680 --> 3:25:12.360]  actually meant to be kind of parallel.
[3:25:12.360 --> 3:25:16.440]  And I'll prove that to you here in a little bit, but you're going to see the continuity.
[3:25:16.440 --> 3:25:17.440]  This is not crazy.
[3:25:17.440 --> 3:25:21.960]  This may sound a little out there, but I'm going to show you the C.S. Lewis and Tolkien
[3:25:21.960 --> 3:25:25.160]  were saying the exact same thing as Alex Jones, believe it or not.
[3:25:25.160 --> 3:25:26.160]  I'm not joking.
[3:25:26.160 --> 3:25:30.240]  You will learn that they were literally Alex Jones fans.
[3:25:30.240 --> 3:25:32.840]  They were saying the exact same things that Alex is telling you.
[3:25:32.840 --> 3:25:34.680]  So why am I talking about this?
[3:25:34.680 --> 3:25:36.160]  Because how do we wake people up?
[3:25:36.160 --> 3:25:38.920]  How do we get people to understand what's going on?
[3:25:38.920 --> 3:25:41.520]  Everybody has seen Tolkien.
[3:25:41.520 --> 3:25:43.320]  Everybody has seen Lord of the Rings.
[3:25:43.320 --> 3:25:45.240]  Most people are familiar with Narnia.
[3:25:45.240 --> 3:25:50.440]  Not many people are familiar with C.S. Lewis's space trilogy, which is actually more sophisticated,
[3:25:50.440 --> 3:25:56.880]  more powerful and insightful than Narnia, but the space trilogy is about Tolkien.
[3:25:56.880 --> 3:25:59.360]  Did you know that the main character, Ransom, is Tolkien?
[3:25:59.360 --> 3:26:00.600]  Anyway, we'll get to that in a minute.
[3:26:00.600 --> 3:26:05.360]  I don't want to get too far ahead of myself, but going back to the revolutionary ethos.
[3:26:05.360 --> 3:26:09.720]  The idea of the revolutionaries was to create the new society.
[3:26:09.720 --> 3:26:12.720]  Everything had to be destroyed that came before.
[3:26:12.720 --> 3:26:18.800]  So they came up with the idea of a new calendar with no Christian holidays, no Christmas, none
[3:26:18.800 --> 3:26:19.800]  of that stuff.
[3:26:19.800 --> 3:26:23.880]  It's got to be all new, rationalist, science man holidays.
[3:26:23.880 --> 3:26:27.080]  They just made up stuff, Thermador, which made up nonsense.
[3:26:27.080 --> 3:26:28.320]  So we're going to celebrate Thermador.
[3:26:28.320 --> 3:26:30.760]  We're going to celebrate science today.
[3:26:30.760 --> 3:26:35.400]  And all of it was just to replace and give people another version of what they had before
[3:26:35.400 --> 3:26:38.920]  but what taught the revolutionary faith.
[3:26:38.920 --> 3:26:42.560]  So they had to get rid of all the history and they called it year zero.
[3:26:42.560 --> 3:26:48.720]  The idea of bulldozing and getting rid of all the past is fundamental to the revolutionary
[3:26:48.720 --> 3:26:49.720]  ethos.
[3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:53.800]  That's why you see the left and people doing this kind of stuff really hardcore in the
[3:26:53.800 --> 3:26:55.760]  last several years.
[3:26:55.760 --> 3:26:56.920]  They're not doing anything new.
[3:26:56.920 --> 3:27:02.240]  This is what every radical Jacob and Illuminous revolutionary regime has done.
[3:27:02.240 --> 3:27:05.200]  You have to erase history.
[3:27:05.200 --> 3:27:10.720]  And it's always erected around the notion of an oppressor oppressed mythology that might
[3:27:10.720 --> 3:27:11.720]  have some truth.
[3:27:11.720 --> 3:27:13.960]  That there's always been tyrannical oppressive governments.
[3:27:13.960 --> 3:27:18.880]  The problem is that they will act like if we can just destroy everybody that came before
[3:27:18.880 --> 3:27:23.680]  and everything that came before, then we can finally erect what we're after.
[3:27:23.680 --> 3:27:28.160]  But they never come to think or to consider that maybe their revolutionary philosophy
[3:27:28.160 --> 3:27:30.560]  itself is the problem.
[3:27:30.560 --> 3:27:33.160]  Maybe they're the ones that are evil and satanic.
[3:27:33.160 --> 3:27:39.160]  Saul Linsky dedicates his revolutionary strategies book to Satan.
[3:27:39.160 --> 3:27:44.440]  And they think that they're on this revolutionary banner to create this great society that will
[3:27:44.440 --> 3:27:45.440]  be egalitarian.
[3:27:45.440 --> 3:27:50.920]  It'll be everything will be free and it'll be great and it always ends in mass death.
[3:27:50.920 --> 3:27:51.920]  Why?
[3:27:51.920 --> 3:27:57.520]  Well, number one, because they're under delusion, they don't really have a grasp on reality.
[3:27:57.520 --> 3:28:02.320]  Number two, they are so idealistic and married to their own delusions that they really think
[3:28:02.320 --> 3:28:08.920]  they can stamp into the world their perfect idealistic sort of Hegelian thing.
[3:28:08.920 --> 3:28:12.200]  They think they can make it manifest.
[3:28:12.200 --> 3:28:16.960]  And that's why when they find out that people oppose them, they immediately just go nuts
[3:28:16.960 --> 3:28:20.280]  and feel like they have to kill their opponents.
[3:28:20.280 --> 3:28:27.000]  Because the existence of people that don't go along with their program calls their program
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:29.080]  into question.
[3:28:29.080 --> 3:28:31.520]  It means that maybe they're not right and they can't handle that.
[3:28:31.520 --> 3:28:34.880]  That's why so many people are turning to going nuts now, they're going crazy.
[3:28:34.880 --> 3:28:37.760]  They want to kill the conservatives, they want to put us in camps, all this kind of
[3:28:37.760 --> 3:28:42.120]  stuff, because they know that deep down they might be evil and they might be wrong.
[3:28:42.120 --> 3:28:47.040]  And so they have to double down, they have to keep doubling down like an Oral Burrus
[3:28:47.040 --> 3:28:51.880]  eating themselves, self-destruction.
[3:28:51.880 --> 3:29:01.160]  They literally want self-destruction, don't go anywhere.
[3:29:01.160 --> 3:29:04.800]  And we've been getting a lot of crypto donations, which is keeping us on air, want to salute
[3:29:04.800 --> 3:29:05.800]  all those.

[3:30:53.280 --> 3:31:00.160]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand infowars, I've been on the air a couple
[3:31:00.160 --> 3:31:05.160]  of years but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show and I wanted
[3:31:05.160 --> 3:31:08.920]  to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[3:31:08.920 --> 3:31:14.560]  And it was a t-shirt I designed the first one, mass murderers agreed gun control works
[3:31:14.560 --> 3:31:17.760]  that helped us finance hiring the first three members of my crew.
[3:31:17.760 --> 3:31:20.200]  That's our oldest design and we still sell it.
[3:31:20.200 --> 3:31:25.200]  We have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions because

[3:31:30.240 --> 3:31:31.240]  to get rid of inventory.
[3:31:31.240 --> 3:31:35.240]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future, they'll just be limited editions and short
[3:31:35.240 --> 3:31:36.240]  runs.

[3:32:57.400 --> 3:33:10.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:10.840 --> 3:33:11.840]  Welcome back to The Outshown.
[3:33:11.840 --> 3:33:17.040]  So we were talking about how we're getting up to the 20th century's revolutionary ethos
[3:33:17.040 --> 3:33:23.080]  from the French Revolution and I was telling you about how they had these ideas of perfect
[3:33:23.080 --> 3:33:31.200]  egalitarianism, perfect enforced equalitarianism will make everybody in a literal sense equal.
[3:33:31.200 --> 3:33:35.760]  Everybody will be part of this giant blob and that's why they were collectivists in
[3:33:35.760 --> 3:33:37.120]  the French Revolution.
[3:33:37.120 --> 3:33:42.000]  And this is precisely where you've heard, I'm sure, of Adam Weishaupt and his philosophy.
[3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:48.840]  Weishaupt's Illuminism was Communism and he had been influenced by a lot of medieval communistic
[3:33:48.840 --> 3:33:52.520]  style movements to create the perfect society.
[3:33:52.520 --> 3:33:56.800]  And although it was not very popular at the time, there were a lot of secret societies
[3:33:56.800 --> 3:34:00.400]  that had sort of jumped on board with this at the time of the French Revolution and
[3:34:00.400 --> 3:34:06.200]  over time the spread and the same forces, the same ideas behind the French Revolutionary
[3:34:06.200 --> 3:34:12.480]  Attempt to create the great reset year zero perfect society did the exact same thing in
[3:34:12.480 --> 3:34:14.360]  the Bull Street Revolution.
[3:34:14.360 --> 3:34:20.440]  And if you have read Billington, you know that he talks about how the journalists, I
[3:34:20.440 --> 3:34:25.560]  had a grad class sometimes I totally forgotten this, but the journalists in the French Revolution
[3:34:25.560 --> 3:34:30.240]  back at that time, they were the ones who were the new moral fact checkers, the new
[3:34:30.240 --> 3:34:35.160]  moral preachers now that the church had been replaced, the journalists had the ability
[3:34:35.160 --> 3:34:39.960]  at that time to get people executed if the journalist didn't expose on you back at the
[3:34:39.960 --> 3:34:42.920]  time of the French Revolution, right?
[3:34:42.920 --> 3:34:48.960]  If Lord Babouf was too fat, then he wasn't a man of the people because he was bourgeoisie.
[3:34:48.960 --> 3:34:50.440]  You see, he was overweight.
[3:34:50.440 --> 3:34:55.800]  So he's not really a revolutionary even though he pretended to be off of his head.
[3:34:55.800 --> 3:34:59.840]  And they gave the journalist the ability to dictate the morality and send his people
[3:34:59.840 --> 3:35:02.960]  to death for not being a true part of the revolution.
[3:35:02.960 --> 3:35:07.000]  I can't believe I've forgotten that because that's exactly what is going on on Twitter.
[3:35:07.000 --> 3:35:12.040]  I mean, thank God now Elon has bought Twitter and things seem to be changing there.
[3:35:12.040 --> 3:35:18.840]  But typically speaking, the mainstream journalist is no different in his role for he zims their
[3:35:18.840 --> 3:35:23.080]  role than it was back at the time of the French Revolution.
[3:35:23.080 --> 3:35:25.240]  And I can believe I've forgotten that was so important.
[3:35:25.240 --> 3:35:30.080]  So shout out to Tristan for reminding me of that.
[3:35:30.080 --> 3:35:35.000]  And when it doesn't occur, what do they do? Well, they just repackage and redo the revolution
[3:35:35.000 --> 3:35:36.000]  a few years later.
[3:35:36.000 --> 3:35:37.640]  And they'll do it in another country.
[3:35:37.640 --> 3:35:38.720]  It's the exact same model.
[3:35:38.720 --> 3:35:40.160]  They do the exact same thing.
[3:35:40.160 --> 3:35:43.880]  It's a scientific technique of revolution.
[3:35:43.880 --> 3:35:45.600]  And they did the same thing in the Bolshevik Revolution.
[3:35:45.600 --> 3:35:50.440]  So when the Bolsheviks did this in Russia and they were funded by the elites in the West,
[3:35:50.440 --> 3:35:55.720]  by the way, they just did the exact same model, destroy everything that came before, raise
[3:35:55.720 --> 3:36:03.880]  it to the ground. And people like journalists, right, and fiery people in the salons and what
[3:36:03.880 --> 3:36:08.600]  not just like in France, like they start, they stoked the fires of revolution.
[3:36:08.600 --> 3:36:14.640]  And anybody who wasn't up to date with the latest orthodoxy that week, it would literally
[3:36:14.640 --> 3:36:21.120]  change was also subject to the revolutionary purging.
[3:36:21.120 --> 3:36:25.000]  And that's why Alex is always correct to point out that the first people that are going
[3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:31.040]  to be axed in this great reset are the people who serve the system.
[3:36:31.040 --> 3:36:35.920]  It's just a fundamental ignorance of history to not know that that's what revolutionaries
[3:36:35.920 --> 3:36:37.320]  have always done.
[3:36:37.320 --> 3:36:42.000]  They always, because they're not really about the revolution.
[3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:52.240]  They are always tools of money power, industrial power, always, or foreign powers, all revolutions
[3:36:52.240 --> 3:36:56.640]  in the modern world in the last 1500 or last 500 years since the 1500s.
[3:36:56.640 --> 3:37:03.760]  All of those revolutions are essentially funded and used by some offshore power or some bigger
[3:37:03.760 --> 3:37:09.920]  power block or some foreign entity or some bank or some private industry.
[3:37:09.920 --> 3:37:14.200]  Even the great analyst and historian Oswald Spangler said there's never been a socialist
[3:37:14.200 --> 3:37:18.280]  revolution, which was not the tool of the money power.
[3:37:18.280 --> 3:37:22.200]  And I don't agree with everything that Spangler said, but he was a, you know, wise sage.
[3:37:22.200 --> 3:37:27.040]  He could say in terms of history and analysis Spangler knew that.
[3:37:27.040 --> 3:37:29.840]  I think he himself had some kind of like oppression socialist view.
[3:37:29.840 --> 3:37:35.840]  So even he, you know, had apparently bought into this to a degree.
[3:37:35.840 --> 3:37:40.360]  So socialism and revolutionary communism, all of the isms that doesn't really matter.
[3:37:40.360 --> 3:37:43.560]  They're all really the same kind of thing, Fabian socialism, Marxism.
[3:37:43.560 --> 3:37:50.040]  They all have the same modus operandi of raising to the ground everything that came before
[3:37:50.040 --> 3:37:53.920]  them and they're impelled by ultimately a satanic ethos and even though they may not
[3:37:53.920 --> 3:37:59.520]  believe in Satan, they actually typically will say, you know, Satan is our symbol.
[3:37:59.520 --> 3:38:04.000]  Think about George Bernard Shaw, these different people, Fabian socialists and Bertrand Russell
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:07.720]  was amongst the Fabian socialists for a while with H.G. Wells and they had this liberal
[3:38:07.720 --> 3:38:15.280]  veneer, but really deep down they are controlled by people like the Royal society.
[3:38:15.280 --> 3:38:17.360]  That's how the Fabian social society worked.
[3:38:17.360 --> 3:38:21.800]  It was the left, the fake left arm of the real Illuminati.
[3:38:21.800 --> 3:38:26.840]  By the real Illuminati, I'm speaking of the same powers and forces that were the money
[3:38:26.840 --> 3:38:33.720]  influenced behind the French Revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution, the same old families,
[3:38:33.720 --> 3:38:40.480]  the same black nobility, the same British royalty, the same banking elites, the same
[3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:46.480]  industrial elites, the exact same people today, I'm not literally the same people are not
[3:38:46.480 --> 3:38:52.080]  vampires, like they're not literally living through the century, but the same ideology
[3:38:52.080 --> 3:38:59.480]  in these elite families, in these groups that vehemently believe that in order to erect
[3:38:59.480 --> 3:39:04.280]  the perfect society, they must kill most people.
[3:39:04.280 --> 3:39:08.560]  And why would that seem strange or hard to believe if you've had any basic history?
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:13.040]  If you know anything about the history of regimes, especially the communist socialist
[3:39:13.040 --> 3:39:19.280]  regimes, which believe like Plato's Republic, the Republic is a communistic-style society,
[3:39:19.280 --> 3:39:24.240]  the belief that you have to cull the population at regular intervals, right?
[3:39:24.240 --> 3:39:29.920]  It's like, you got to weed the garden, that's how they view it.
[3:39:29.920 --> 3:39:35.280]  And the same idea is combined with technocracy, which also comes out of ancient Greek philosophy
[3:39:35.280 --> 3:39:37.520]  that comes out of Plato's Republic.
[3:39:37.520 --> 3:39:43.960]  So when you combine technocracy with this, you get a dangerous mixture of the idea that,
[3:39:43.960 --> 3:39:49.360]  well, the previous revolutions didn't work because, number one, humans are fallible,
[3:39:49.360 --> 3:39:55.680]  they make free will decisions, they have these false ideas like love and family values or
[3:39:55.680 --> 3:39:58.280]  whatever, Christianity, God's existence.
[3:39:58.280 --> 3:40:03.480]  If we could just erase all of that and then bring in the technocracy, that will be the
[3:40:03.480 --> 3:40:06.080]  key to the utopia.
[3:40:06.080 --> 3:40:09.320]  And so it's a faith, that's why Billington calls it a revolutionary faith, that they
[3:40:09.320 --> 3:40:15.480]  will be able to set up a perfect utopia if they can overcome man.
[3:40:15.480 --> 3:40:18.280]  Man is the problem according to these people.
[3:40:18.280 --> 3:40:19.920]  Humanity is the problem.
[3:40:19.920 --> 3:40:23.480]  What does the first global revolution book say from the Club of Rome?
[3:40:23.480 --> 3:40:29.400]  We have come up with the idea that humans are the problem and pollution is our new global
[3:40:29.400 --> 3:40:30.400]  threat.
[3:40:30.400 --> 3:40:37.080]  They even say, we just came up with it, so there is such a thing as pollution, obviously,
[3:40:37.080 --> 3:40:39.520]  but pollution is not the great global threat.
[3:40:39.520 --> 3:40:42.120]  They just chose a great global threat.
[3:40:42.120 --> 3:40:49.280]  These vast corporate elite interests chose this because they are committed to this belief
[3:40:49.280 --> 3:40:53.360]  that mankind must be wiped out and overcome.
[3:40:53.360 --> 3:40:59.200]  And people called that crazy, they said it's hard to believe, even though you've all,
[3:40:59.200 --> 3:41:03.840]  McCain, Euthafro, Ferrari, whatever his name is, even though he's up there literally saying
[3:41:03.840 --> 3:41:09.280]  this in countless clips and lectures, I've shared it all across Twitter and everything,
[3:41:09.280 --> 3:41:10.720]  that there is no free will.
[3:41:10.720 --> 3:41:11.880]  You will be destroyed.
[3:41:11.880 --> 3:41:13.240]  You must be overcome.
[3:41:13.240 --> 3:41:14.360]  Humanity must be hacked.
[3:41:14.360 --> 3:41:17.880]  Humanity must become a giant matrix blob, Borg blob.
[3:41:17.880 --> 3:41:24.920]  He says all these things constantly and he's classed as understudy.
[3:41:24.920 --> 3:41:30.680]  So while reading all these global elite books, reading all this great reset stuff, and remember
[3:41:30.680 --> 3:41:33.800]  a lot of these people come out of the Royal Society, they come out of the Oxford Cambridge
[3:41:33.800 --> 3:41:39.960]  circles, the Clivedin set, the Astros, those people are a big part of this, according to
[3:41:39.960 --> 3:41:41.040]  Quigley.
[3:41:41.040 --> 3:41:45.520]  And separate from that, I mean, I knew that Lewis and Tolkien had been in some of those
[3:41:45.520 --> 3:41:46.520]  circles.
[3:41:46.520 --> 3:41:49.600]  They knew some of these people, they've been writing about these things to a degree, but
[3:41:49.600 --> 3:41:56.520]  when I read the Space Trilogy, I could not believe the precision with which the artistic
[3:41:56.520 --> 3:42:00.840]  power of Lewis literally predicts the future.
[3:42:00.840 --> 3:42:07.600]  I mean, he was writing about the technocracy, transhumanism, and all of this being satanic,
[3:42:07.600 --> 3:42:10.800]  Luciferianism, the control left-right dialectic.
[3:42:10.800 --> 3:42:17.720]  He calls it an international conspiracy by the National Institute for Coordinated Experiments
[3:42:17.720 --> 3:42:21.800]  NICE, that he's making a joke that they call themselves NICE.
[3:42:21.800 --> 3:42:25.800]  He's talking about Tavistock and the scientific, illuminous elite.
[3:42:25.800 --> 3:42:29.480]  He's talking about the real, scientism-based Illuminati.
[3:42:29.480 --> 3:42:31.720]  I'm not joking.
[3:42:31.720 --> 3:42:37.280]  That hideous strength, the third installment of the Space Trilogy, calls it that, but he
[3:42:37.280 --> 3:42:44.040]  has a hero in the book who is a professor and a linguist who exposes this to the entire
[3:42:44.040 --> 3:42:45.040]  world.
[3:42:45.040 --> 3:42:49.320]  The name is Ransom, the hero of the first two, and then he plays a significant role as a
[3:42:49.320 --> 3:42:50.840]  hero in the third one.
[3:42:50.840 --> 3:42:56.280]  Guess who Ransom is based on?
[3:42:56.280 --> 3:42:57.280]  You see this?
[3:42:57.280 --> 3:43:02.840]  It's an Info Wars Republic Defense Card with original Info Wars art designed by yours truly

[3:43:07.960 --> 3:43:12.680]  There are only 25,000 of these in existence, and they'll never be made again.
[3:43:12.680 --> 3:43:16.560]  The bank that owns the mint that has started putting these out the last few years just
[3:43:16.560 --> 3:43:22.320]  sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling
[3:43:22.320 --> 3:43:23.320]  these for.

[3:47:10.920 --> 3:47:11.920]  Welcome back to The Outstanding Show.
[3:47:11.920 --> 3:47:14.160]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[3:47:14.160 --> 3:47:17.440]  Jay DeNalysis, also of the YouTube channel, Jay Dyer.
[3:47:17.440 --> 3:47:22.600]  If you like this discussion, by the way, I have lengthy lectures through these works.
[3:47:22.600 --> 3:47:27.600]  We've been going through the CSList Space Trilogy, and I'm about done with that.
[3:47:27.600 --> 3:47:32.400]  We'll post the second lecture for the subscribers, but I get into a lot of this over on my YouTube
[3:47:32.400 --> 3:47:37.720]  channel, which I just hit 90, almost right at 90, so I'm trying to work up to 100,000.
[3:47:37.720 --> 3:47:43.200]  I know we're not big fans of YouTube, but definitely you can still reach people through
[3:47:43.200 --> 3:47:49.760]  that platform if you can filter them over from YouTube to better platforms such as this
[3:47:49.760 --> 3:47:53.200]  one here, or I also have a lot of content over on my Rockfin channel.
[3:47:53.200 --> 3:47:57.200]  By the way, I'll be having a good discussion with Eddie Bravo over on Rockfin pretty soon
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:47:59.040]  too, so that'll be a lot of fun.
[3:47:59.040 --> 3:48:03.840]  Now we were talking about the predictive elements of Lewis and Tolkien, and they knew about
[3:48:03.840 --> 3:48:05.080]  this conspiracy.
[3:48:05.080 --> 3:48:09.120]  That's what's kind of blown me away is that what I finally realized, by the way, that's
[3:48:09.120 --> 3:48:10.120]  my channel.
[3:48:10.120 --> 3:48:15.800]  I just dropped the hottest rap track of the summer right there, pay piggy remix, which
[3:48:15.800 --> 3:48:20.000]  actually, it's pretty funny if you go listen to it.
[3:48:20.000 --> 3:48:24.160]  I'm getting a lot of comments saying they really like it, so I'm happy about that.
[3:48:24.160 --> 3:48:27.600]  It's a joke track, but I don't know if people can figure out that a lot of the stuff I do
[3:48:27.600 --> 3:48:34.000]  is tongue in cheek, so don't take that too seriously, but it is a fire hip-hop track
[3:48:34.000 --> 3:48:38.280]  for the summer barbecues.
[3:48:38.280 --> 3:48:41.600]  They were in the circles of, they had their own little club, for example, that they called
[3:48:41.600 --> 3:48:44.840]  the Inklings, and this was Lewis, Tolkien, and some other writers together, and they
[3:48:44.840 --> 3:48:51.800]  sort of bounced ideas off of one another, but there were other people from the Oxford
[3:48:51.800 --> 3:48:57.640]  Cambridge circles that did have basically Christian views, and they had gotten wind of
[3:48:57.640 --> 3:49:03.440]  the things that people like Bertrand Russell believed, and so they were kind of shook because,
[3:49:03.440 --> 3:49:09.560]  on the one hand, you can tell they're wanting to put out really good artwork in terms of
[3:49:09.560 --> 3:49:15.260]  their novels and their stories, but they were definitely concerned about not just World
[3:49:15.260 --> 3:49:21.840]  War II, I think most normie analysis of, you know, C.S. Lewis' books even, especially
[3:49:21.840 --> 3:49:26.480]  Tolkien's Trilogy, is, oh, it's about World War II, right, the Sauron and the Eye and
[3:49:26.480 --> 3:49:32.000]  all this, the Great Battle is World War II, and I don't think, I think it's more than
[3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:37.720]  that because, you know, the process of Tolkien writing Lord of the Rings, which he wrote
[3:49:37.720 --> 3:49:42.120]  after, I mean, it took him many years to write it, but it was published, I think, in the
[3:49:42.120 --> 3:49:49.920]  1950s, like, 54, 5, is when it finally came out, 54, Fellowship of the Ring, and then
[3:49:49.920 --> 3:49:56.240]  Return of the King by 1955, so, but Lewis' Space Trilogy, he finished the third one,
[3:49:56.240 --> 3:50:00.800]  which is the most important in that trilogy in 1945, so 10 years earlier, he had finished
[3:50:00.800 --> 3:50:06.200]  that, and he mentions that he had been influenced by multiple people in the Inklings, their
[3:50:06.200 --> 3:50:12.320]  literary circle, to put this novel out, and as I said, I was watching a bunch of professors
[3:50:12.320 --> 3:50:17.240]  from various evangelical schools and different religious traditions, give their analysis
[3:50:17.240 --> 3:50:23.160]  of these books to see what they thought, and nobody could figure out what Part III is about.
[3:50:23.160 --> 3:50:29.480]  Now Part III, as we said, is about this secret institute that has a cover front for a humanitarian
[3:50:29.480 --> 3:50:37.960]  NGO scientific experimentation and work, called the NICE Institute, NICE, and in NICE, there's
[3:50:37.960 --> 3:50:42.960]  a guy who's recruited into it under the guise of helping the world and doing sociology for
[3:50:42.960 --> 3:50:51.080]  the purpose of creating a utopia, and what we find out, I'm not going to spoil the story,
[3:50:51.080 --> 3:50:54.920]  but as the story progresses, what we find out is that this is actually a front for an
[3:50:54.920 --> 3:51:00.640]  institute that is just like the Tavistock Institute. It's pretty amazing. I'm convinced
[3:51:00.640 --> 3:51:03.960]  that C.S. Lewis had to have known about this, and he definitely knew about Bertrand Russell
[3:51:03.960 --> 3:51:08.320]  and Russell's plans. Being part of the Royal Society, the Fabian Social Society, they even
[3:51:08.320 --> 3:51:15.360]  have a Fabian Socialist approach in the institute in that hideous string. He even says that
[3:51:15.360 --> 3:51:23.960]  they control and create riots and chaos, false flags, to stir up society, to eventually
[3:51:23.960 --> 3:51:34.160]  bring in the police state that they want to bring in under Satan. There's a scene where
[3:51:34.160 --> 3:51:41.080]  eventually they are interacting with this. It's an inverse of the incarnation of Christ.
[3:51:41.080 --> 3:51:47.160]  It's this being they're trying to create who's the severed head of a scientist who they're
[3:51:47.160 --> 3:51:56.120]  trying to keep it alive, and they want to create the body for an anti-Christ figure.
[3:51:56.120 --> 3:52:00.520]  The head still has consciousness. It's told in a mythological way. The head still has
[3:52:00.520 --> 3:52:04.320]  consciousness, and at one point, the main character who's duped into this, he goes and
[3:52:04.320 --> 3:52:10.440]  meets with the head. It could easily be the head of Bertrand Russell. He says, what's
[3:52:10.440 --> 3:52:14.840]  the purpose of the institute? What are we trying to do here? The idea, he says, is that
[3:52:14.840 --> 3:52:19.800]  well, if you look at the moon, the moon is a world that is all death and dust. There's
[3:52:19.800 --> 3:52:27.080]  nothing there. He says, that's what I want because whoever at one time lived on the moon,
[3:52:27.080 --> 3:52:32.000]  he says they must have transcended their body and bodily existence. He says, if you think
[3:52:32.000 --> 3:52:38.960]  about it, biology and natural, the natural order is the problem. The head says we have
[3:52:38.960 --> 3:52:44.880]  to get rid of bodies. We have to transcend it by technology. We will create a kind of
[3:52:44.880 --> 3:52:52.920]  upload consciousness that will no longer require bodily existence. And in order to do that,
[3:52:52.920 --> 3:53:00.600]  the head says, we have to wipe out all organic life on the planet. Now, in the novel, it
[3:53:00.600 --> 3:53:07.320]  is made explicit that this is a satanic conspiracy. The head is actually prompted and motivated
[3:53:07.320 --> 3:53:15.040]  by the dark archon who was identified as Satan in the story. But there's a figure who is
[3:53:15.040 --> 3:53:22.600]  the antithesis, the ultimate good figure in the trilogy who is Professor Ransom. And Professor
[3:53:22.600 --> 3:53:26.720]  Ransom, according to C.S. Lewis himself in the trilogy at the end of the first book,
[3:53:26.720 --> 3:53:36.680]  is based on Tolkien. He's a philologist who wants to expose this story of the grand Illuminati
[3:53:36.680 --> 3:53:43.320]  scientism control takeover and depopulation agenda, but he knows he can't come out and
[3:53:43.320 --> 3:53:49.160]  talk about it and no one will believe him. Imagine knowing about the entire NWO plan
[3:53:49.160 --> 3:53:54.880]  in the 40s, 30s, 40s, 50s. And they did because they were around the people of the Royal Society
[3:53:54.880 --> 3:53:58.760]  who openly talked about it. They knew what C.S. Lewis, excuse me, Russell had written.
[3:53:58.760 --> 3:54:09.320]  And so they wrote counter mythologies, space trilogy, Lord of the Rings trilogy against
[3:54:09.320 --> 3:54:14.840]  this view. And so I was blown away when I realized this from reading all this and reading
[3:54:14.840 --> 3:54:22.000]  into Lewis himself talking about what it's about. And it's essentially saying that Professor
[3:54:22.000 --> 3:54:27.240]  Ransom is Tolkien. He can't write about the Illuminati confirmed plan because no one will
[3:54:27.240 --> 3:54:33.360]  believe him. So he's going to put it into the book. Lewis's space trilogy is about how
[3:54:33.360 --> 3:54:41.680]  Ransom, Tolkien is going to expose this in his books. Expose the Tavistock Illuminati
[3:54:41.680 --> 3:54:48.720]  plan. Nobody has figured this out. I mean, I'm not trying to brag, but I'm saying, how
[3:54:48.720 --> 3:54:52.040]  could I, how could all these professors are watching all these analyses, like these literary
[3:54:52.040 --> 3:54:55.280]  professors that I don't know what the, the third book, it doesn't make any sense. I don't
[3:54:55.280 --> 3:55:01.800]  know what it's about. What is this nice institute? What are you, what's it about? It's about
[3:55:01.800 --> 3:55:09.000]  scientism. It's about Bertrand Russell. Clearly. It's about a Luciferian conspiracy to depopulate
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:17.160]  the world. It even explains in the third book what the book is about. How could you be blind
[3:55:17.160 --> 3:55:25.600]  to this? And he even explains that Tolkien's trilogy is about the same thing. The Lord of
[3:55:25.600 --> 3:55:36.320]  the Rings is about exposing the scientific revolutionary plot of the Illuminati confirmed.
[3:55:36.320 --> 3:55:40.360]  And that makes all the more sense when we think now about what happens in the Lord of
[3:55:40.360 --> 3:55:48.280]  the Rings. The Lord of the Rings symbolizes intense technological power, god-like technological
[3:55:48.280 --> 3:55:52.480]  power. It's similar to the Ring of Geigees that's in Plato's Republic where there's
[3:55:52.480 --> 3:55:59.000]  a ring that makes you invisible. Tolkien is intentionally referring back to the technocratic
[3:55:59.000 --> 3:56:08.720]  view in the Republic of Plato and the attaining of the power of technology that's almost god-like,
[3:56:08.720 --> 3:56:17.760]  right? The problem is that when entities and people are duped by this power and they don't
[3:56:17.760 --> 3:56:23.880]  have the virtue and the wisdom to go along with the pure knowledge that they have, then
[3:56:23.880 --> 3:56:32.400]  it will erect a dystopia and chaos and death like never before seen. Mr. Frodo, Mr. Frodo,
[3:56:32.400 --> 3:56:42.420]  Drona, scroll the ring in! That's Mr. Frodo, Sam, Sam, take it the opposite sides and
[3:56:42.420 --> 3:56:43.420]  go.
[3:56:43.420 --> 3:56:48.060]  I couldn't resist throwing in some legoless and Sam Frodo discussions. But again, I was
[3:56:48.060 --> 3:56:52.940]  blown away because I grew up with obviously, I read Lord of the Rings many times growing
[3:56:52.940 --> 3:56:59.120]  up. I'd never read the space trilogy until now, but knowing and having read all the writings
[3:56:59.120 --> 3:57:04.460]  of these globus elite of the last 10 years, 60, 70 of them by now. And then reading the
[3:57:04.460 --> 3:57:11.160]  space trilogy, that's what this is about. So I kid you not, C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien
[3:57:11.160 --> 3:57:19.360]  prove hashtag Alex Jones was right. And if you want to hear more about this, I will go
[3:57:19.360 --> 3:57:23.160]  into a lot more depth with breaking down the symbolism. If you go over to my YouTube channel,
[3:57:23.160 --> 3:57:29.400]  help me get to 100,000. Help me get to 100,000. And then we can keep following people over
[3:57:29.400 --> 3:57:35.640]  from those big platforms still to the smaller platforms and the alternative media platforms.
[3:57:35.640 --> 3:57:39.920]  I'm not trying to diss a Bandai video. It's actually bigger than a lot of the mainstream
[3:57:39.920 --> 3:57:43.400]  platforms now. And I think it'll keep growing. If we can keep Alex on the air, support the
[3:57:43.400 --> 3:57:44.920]  show, buy things right.
[3:57:44.920 --> 3:57:49.920]  I designed over 200 t-shirts in the last 25 years. And we have some of those original
