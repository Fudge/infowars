[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  It's Thursday, February 3rd of the year, it's 2222.
[00:16.000 --> 00:24.000]  It's for Wars, Tomorrow's News, today.
[00:24.000 --> 00:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:29.000 --> 00:34.000]  I intend to open the phones up again today and take your amazing calls.
[00:34.000 --> 00:41.000]  We also have former NBA star and current MMA fighter Royce White,
[00:41.000 --> 00:48.000]  who's been exposing the whole episode agenda and the persecution of the Uyghurs in China,
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  joining us coming up in the third hour today.
[00:52.000 --> 01:01.000]  And then Paul Joseph Watson will host the fourth hour from her Satanic Majesty's Command Base, London.
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.000]  So that is coming up here today.
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  But in the last part of this first hour and for the entire second hour,
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  I do want to take your phone calls on a raft of issues.
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.000]  You know, I don't like to talk about CNN because it has such a low viewership,
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  but it's important to talk about it at the same time because it is the mouth of the establishment.
[01:26.000 --> 01:33.000]  And of course, it's come out that they're involved in a lot of really bizarre, corrupt, evil sex scandals,
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.000]  including indictments for trying to sex traffic little children.
[01:38.000 --> 01:44.000]  And the word has been that Zucker obviously used that for control in blackmail inside the organization,
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  but now it is beginning to come out.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  So they want to have face saving. Oh, he had a relationship with a woman there for a decade,
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.000]  and she gets to stay, but he has to go because a man and woman together is the greatest crime on earth.
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.000]  No, it's helping kill the people in the nursing homes with the COVID patients.
[02:01.000 --> 02:07.000]  It's helping cover that up. And it's all the continued scandals there,
[02:07.000 --> 02:15.000]  going back to the 80s when it was founded as a front for the CIA that uses pedophilia for control.
[02:15.000 --> 02:21.000]  So if you think Jeffrey Epstein is bad, it's all peas in a pod or like Russian dolls.
[02:21.000 --> 02:32.000]  It all nest within itself. So I've been telling you a long time that CNN is a pedophile ring and as bad as it gets.
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  I don't have evidence that Jeff Zucker himself rapes children,
[02:36.000 --> 02:43.000]  but we do know they cover it up and have whitewash articles like Atlantic Monthly owned by Steve Jobs' wife,
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  who's one of the biggest financiers attacking this show. We know that.
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  She has big articles constantly. There is no pedophilia. It's not happening. It's made up.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  Nothing's going on. Everything's fine.
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.000]  All academia and the New York Times and USA Today say, you know,
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  sex with one-year-old children is just wonderful. They love it.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  We played sickening clips yesterday saying that grandmothers need to have sex with their grandsons and granddaughters,
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.000]  raping them for the love and goodness, and that actually sits loving and good.
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  And that's who these people are, vomiting pure Satanism directly at you,
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.000]  radiating nothing but total division and tribalism and divide and conquer.
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.000]  They call racism and just everything they do is pure poison injected into the psyche of humanity.
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  I mean, even our headlines aren't hardcore enough. Let's change that headline because he actually says,
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.000]  Professor, it's a mistake to think pedophilia is wrong. He actually said you can't say it's wrong
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  to have sex with one-year-olds if they're consenting.
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  SUNY professor defends sex with one-year-olds.
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.000]  I mean, this stuff is so sensational. I understand why our writers are like this.
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  We tend to dial it back because it's just too unbelievable.
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.000]  When I'm up here describing what the German family courts did with different Western intelligence agencies
[04:03.000 --> 04:11.000]  at an industrial level, tens of thousands of children per sector, per region, in brutal gang raping,
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  brutal mass gang raping of little children, beating the living hell out of them.
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  I mean, that's in the reports inside Catholic churches at night
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  because that makes the Satanism that much better to be raping children on the altar.
[04:25.000 --> 04:32.000]  I mean, that's in DW.com. That's in the biggest TV station in most respected in Germany.
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  So remember, that's who you're up against.
[04:35.000 --> 04:40.000]  And that's who they are. So you wonder why they're so damn evil? Why they never stop?
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  Because they have signed on to the devil.
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  And those that aren't screwing and raping and torturing and killing the kids know about it
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.000]  and are helping cover it up from Atlantic monthly to CNN to USA Today.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  People are the scum of Earth.
[04:55.000 --> 05:24.000]  We'll be right back. Stay well.
[05:25.000 --> 05:35.000]  We'll be right back.
[05:55.000 --> 06:16.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance live from Austin, Texas.
[06:16.000 --> 06:21.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:21.000 --> 06:27.000]  Welcome to the rest of infinity.
[06:27.000 --> 06:35.000]  And as Buzz Lightyear says, infinity and beyond.
[06:35.000 --> 06:42.000]  Wow. You know, I need to start the show more recognizing truth tellers that are doing incredible jobs
[06:42.000 --> 06:45.000]  that may not even be getting the attention they deserve.
[06:45.000 --> 06:51.000]  I've got all this incredible news and all these amazing things and I had this clip yesterday
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  but got busy didn't get to it.
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.000]  So I'm going to play a short clip of this guy who I think is right up there with Tucker Carlson
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  when it comes to being hardcore.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  In fact, maybe even more hardcore than Tucker Carlson, but not as articulate,
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  which I'm not as articulate as Tucker Carlson.
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  He's definitely the top of the line when it comes to that.
[07:07.000 --> 07:13.000]  But this guy's on his hardcore analysis and his courage is 100%.
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  OAN's Pearson Sharp breaks down vaccine lunacy.
[07:17.000 --> 07:19.000]  That's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.000]  It's just part of the reports he does.
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  They're like 10 minutes long and my mouth's just hanging open because I already know it's all true.
[07:25.000 --> 07:31.000]  I've done the research, but the way he lays it out is just savage and he's got new ones every day.
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  And it makes me so mad they're trying to take OAN off the air.
[07:35.000 --> 07:41.000]  And that's why out of the gates, I want listeners to understand we cannot be defeated
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  if we take action and speak out and spread the word right now.
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  We still have outlets that are hardcore.
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.000]  And OAN's gone from being excellent to being fantastic.
[07:51.000 --> 07:52.000]  But what do we got?
[07:52.000 --> 07:55.000]  We got OAN, we got Tucker Carlson, we got Alex Jones.
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.000]  We got a lot of smaller podcasters, people we got Joe coming along.
[07:59.000 --> 08:01.000]  We got a huge awakening taking place.
[08:01.000 --> 08:04.000]  We got a lot of members of parliament in Europe and other places standing up,
[08:04.000 --> 08:07.000]  but we need the people to take action.
[08:07.000 --> 08:14.000]  And to realize that if you don't go to infowars.com or band.video and share that big Marjorie Taylor Green interview we did yesterday,
[08:14.000 --> 08:16.000]  people won't actually get to hear what she said.
[08:16.000 --> 08:22.000]  They'll just see the hundreds of articles demonizing her and spinning what she supposedly said.
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.000]  You are who carries the ball down the field and I salute you and thank you.
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.000]  But I want to encourage you again to realize we're fighting to stay on air.
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.000]  I don't want to prove to you how dire the situation is for info wars and the rest of the independent media
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  by us going off the air or imploding.
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.000]  It's like telling somebody, hey, I got heart problems and hypothetically, which I don't, I'm saying.
[08:40.000 --> 08:43.000]  And then you see them die and have a heart attack one day and you go, damn, they weren't joking.
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  So we need your word of mouth, your prayer, and we need your financial support.
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.000]  So if you're a new listener and never tried any of our supplements or products or water filters or air filters or books or films,
[08:54.000 --> 08:57.000]  they're all the best. They're all amazing.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  And X3, you want to learn about the good halogen and what it does for your body.
[09:00.000 --> 09:04.000]  The next level for your immune system, everything, energy, you name it.
[09:04.000 --> 09:10.000]  X3 is back in stock. All three types of item that your body needs, 50% off at infowarstore.com
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.000]  and just commit as a new listener or viewer that has never gone to infowarstore to do it.
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.000]  I want to thank those that are regular supporters.
[09:16.000 --> 09:22.000]  I want to encourage everybody to help keep us on the air during this critical battle at Point Blank Range with the New World Order.
[09:22.000 --> 09:29.000]  Here's just part of a report that Pearson Sharp broke down on the great OAN.
[09:29.000 --> 09:37.000]  More and more Americans are standing up and fighting back against the tyranny of the COVID conspiracy theory.
[09:37.000 --> 09:44.000]  Convoys of outraged truck drivers are sending a message loud and clear to cowardly leaders all over the world,
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  from Canada to Australia and even here in the US.
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  And that message is simple. Back off or else.
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.000]  We the people will not tolerate this oppression any longer.
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  We have had enough.
[09:59.000 --> 10:05.000]  Enough of watching our businesses get destroyed while hypocritical politicians like Gavin Newsom
[10:05.000 --> 10:11.000]  dine out at fancy restaurants with their friends during lockdowns or go maskless to public events
[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  they demand that we wear masks to.
[10:14.000 --> 10:20.000]  We've had enough of watching our loved ones get sick and die pointless deaths
[10:20.000 --> 10:29.000]  all because the media and despots in Washington refused to let us treat our sick with the safest and most effective drugs in the world
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  like Ivermectin.
[10:31.000 --> 10:38.000]  We've had enough of being denied basic services like being refused entry into a grocery store or restaurant
[10:38.000 --> 10:45.000]  or being refused a life-saving organ transplant unless we have a dehumanizing passport proving
[10:45.000 --> 10:51.000]  we're dumb enough to sign over the rights to our own bodies to these murderous tyrants.
[10:51.000 --> 10:57.000]  Enough of seeing our children die after being forced to take this same poisonous drug
[10:57.000 --> 11:03.000]  that's making big pharma companies like Pfizer and Moderna over $100 billion a year.
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  Enough is enough.
[11:06.000 --> 11:11.000]  They can try to cover up their crimes, but the evidence is mounting and they can't hide it forever.
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.000]  The story that this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated is laughable.
[11:16.000 --> 11:23.000]  How do they explain the hundreds of fully vaccinated cruise ships coming down with the Fauci flu?
[11:23.000 --> 11:31.000]  Israel is one of the most vaccinated countries in the world and right now nearly 1% of their entire population
[11:31.000 --> 11:37.000]  is coming down with the China virus every single day.
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.000]  Think about that. Really, let that number sink in.
[11:41.000 --> 11:48.000]  1% of the entire country gets sick with this engineered virus every day.
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  And they're all fully vaccinated.
[11:50.000 --> 11:56.000]  Wayne Allen Root over on Town Hall put together a great article on this demonstrating how the German government
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  claimed up to 90% of the infected and dead are unvaccinated.
[12:00.000 --> 12:09.000]  But that was a flat out lie because it turns out the German government was actually classifying every sick and dying person as unvaccinated
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  regardless of whether they were or not.
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.000]  Same goes for Canada where they claimed 60% of the COVID deaths were unvaccinated.
[12:16.000 --> 12:25.000]  But that was a lie too because in reality they just classified anyone who got sick or died within two weeks of getting the vaccine as unvaccinated.
[12:25.000 --> 12:34.000]  And surprise, surprise, our own beloved CDC, the Centers for Democrat Control, pulled the same trick on us.
[12:34.000 --> 12:39.000]  The CDC claimed that anyone who died within 14 days of getting injected wasn't vaccinated.
[12:39.000 --> 12:47.000]  Even though the majority of the deaths and injuries from the vaccine happened within that first 14-day period.
[12:47.000 --> 12:53.000]  Good way to cover up all the people they're murdering. Just say they're not vaccinated.
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  Sneaky sneaky.
[12:55.000 --> 13:02.000]  Daniel Nagase, a Canadian doctor for over 15 years who was fired after saving the lives of three patients with ivermectin,
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  says this is just the tip of the iceberg.
[13:04.000 --> 13:12.000]  Nagase said looking at Pfizer's own clinical trial data, the number of deaths and injuries from the vaccine are staggering.
[13:12.000 --> 13:21.000]  According to their data, fully 31% of the people who got the vaccine either died or had permanent disabilities.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  Even more shocking is what's happening in the military.
[13:24.000 --> 13:34.000]  Since the armed forces ruled out the vaccine in one year, cancer rates are up 300% among military members.
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  But that's not all. Infertility is skyrocketing as well.
[13:38.000 --> 13:44.000]  Up 500% in women, along with miscarriages, which are up another 300%.
[13:44.000 --> 13:51.000]  But those numbers pale in comparison to the rates of clinically diagnosed neurological disorders,
[13:51.000 --> 13:59.000]  which went up an astronomical 1,000% from 82,000 to nearly 900,000.
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.000]  And that happened in one year since the vaccines were introduced.
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  Just think about what that's doing to America's ability to defend itself.
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  Our young warriors crippled by their own government.
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  And we still insist on giving this experimental drug to our children.
[14:16.000 --> 14:23.000]  Even research published in the Toxicology Reports Journal, one of the most well-respected medical journals anywhere,
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  found that children have almost no risk from COVID,
[14:27.000 --> 14:34.000]  but suffer severe consequences from what the researchers themselves called toxic inoculations,
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.000]  including paralysis, heart attacks, and even death.
[14:37.000 --> 14:44.000]  The study found the spike proteins from the injections cause permanent damage in children's critical organs,
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  including their brains, nervous, and reproductive systems.
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.000]  After being ordered by a judge in December, Pfizer released its own data,
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.000]  which showed that out of 32 known pregnant women who received the vaccine,
[14:57.000 --> 15:03.000]  28 women experienced fetal death and lost their babies.
[15:03.000 --> 15:10.000]  This is tantamount to child sacrifice on the altar of Big Pharma.
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.000]  Young athletes are another prime group to be targeted by this deadly vaccine
[15:14.000 --> 15:21.000]  with 500% more soccer players in the EU dropping dead from heart attacks than one year ago.
[15:21.000 --> 15:28.000]  500%? Who is actually brain dead enough to think that this is just a coincidence?
[15:28.000 --> 15:35.000]  When Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are known by the FDA to cause heart attacks.
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.000]  This is a pandemic of the ignorant and it's killing our country.
[15:40.000 --> 15:47.000]  So, for all you progressives and Democrats and radical leftists out there, do us all a favor.
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  Please, and go get vaccinated.
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  In fact, don't stop there. Get double vaccinated and be sure to get all your boosters.
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  All right folks, we'll be right back. We'll post a full report in four hours.
[16:24.000 --> 16:30.000]  But most importantly, your immune system. So, X3, the only tri-iodine on the market,
[16:30.000 --> 16:36.000]  highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at mfourstore.com.
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body takes about two weeks to get on average,
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  you really need to experience X3.
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  For those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[16:47.000 --> 16:52.000]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body.
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.000]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the m4 war, a true 360 win.
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.000]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off at limited time.
[17:01.000 --> 17:09.000]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.000]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of,
[17:13.000 --> 17:17.000]  our new sleep support formula, down and out, is just the thing.
[17:17.000 --> 17:24.000]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut eye you deserve.
[17:24.000 --> 17:29.000]  Formulated to improve upon our best selling product, knockout, with down and out,
[17:29.000 --> 17:35.000]  now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[17:35.000 --> 17:40.000]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[17:40.000 --> 17:48.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees,
[17:48.000 --> 17:51.000]  who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[17:51.000 --> 17:57.000]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.

[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do, these aren't.
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[18:38.000 --> 18:43.000]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes.
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.000]  So the calls you are free works like a regular cell phone, you're not being tracked or traced.
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  And I keep one in my car, I've given them to my parents as gifts,
[18:49.000 --> 18:52.000]  way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work.
[18:52.000 --> 18:59.000]  You can call InfowarsPhone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[18:59.000 --> 19:09.000]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food.
[19:09.000 --> 19:10.000]  It's all come out.
[19:10.000 --> 19:17.000]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[19:17.000 --> 19:20.000]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[19:20.000 --> 19:25.000]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy.
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  Is it true?
[19:27.000 --> 19:33.000]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.000]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.000]  because they know we are strong.
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.000]  And they know in the end they signed on to God of this world who is a loser.
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.000]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep Infowars in the air now more than ever.
[19:50.000 --> 19:56.000]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe handling.
[19:56.000 --> 20:18.000]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[20:26.000 --> 20:39.000]  That's the great Jimmy Levy bringing us in.
[20:39.000 --> 20:48.000]  Songs topping with charts talking about liberty and freedom that is so incredibly popular.
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000]  That's why the power structure is trying to suppress us and gaslight us all because they know the awakening is here
[20:53.000 --> 20:59.000]  and they know their corrupt system is going down and they want to take us with them.
[20:59.000 --> 21:04.000]  Alright, let's start drilling into all of this because I've got to get to all this news today.
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  It's so important.
[21:06.000 --> 21:14.000]  The FBI director has come out and discovered a giant new threat that's blown him away.
[21:14.000 --> 21:20.000]  Kind of like the FBI until the mid-1950s told Congress that La Cosa Nostra
[21:20.000 --> 21:27.000]  and organized crime by the Italians did not exist.
[21:27.000 --> 21:34.000]  Because they were being blackmailed by organized crime, at least J. Edgar Hoover was, that's come out.
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.000]  Well, now they tell us Chinese spies don't exist.
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  Even though they basically took over Hollywood, took over the Democratic Party,
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.000]  put their operatives in as the managers of senators and members of the House.
[21:46.000 --> 21:54.000]  But now because George Soros said that China and the communists are bad,
[21:54.000 --> 22:00.000]  because he's God, now the FBI is allowed to admit it exists
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.000]  because Xi Jinping for all of his evil and all of his corruption has decided to not have forced abortion
[22:05.000 --> 22:10.000]  and has decided to tell people to have three children and has decided to be proud of being Chinese
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  and not want to destroy his country.
[22:14.000 --> 22:21.000]  And so because he did that and is not giving George Soros his sacrament of dead babies,
[22:21.000 --> 22:29.000]  well now George Soros' minion has come out and discovered the Chinese communist threat.
[22:29.000 --> 22:36.000]  This is like discovering the moon when you're 50 years old or something.
[22:36.000 --> 22:43.000]  FBI director reveals the one threat of the U.S. that has blown him away.
[22:43.000 --> 22:50.000]  But wait a minute, he just said two years ago and a year ago, got it all right here,
[22:50.000 --> 22:58.000]  that white supremacy is the most lethal threat in America, says the FBI director, Ann Biden.
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.000]  Isn't that just interesting?
[23:01.000 --> 23:06.000]  What you guys can do with the document cam shot is, I was going to do it off air but since you went to me,
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  shoot right here, this is where I show the articles, or you can do wide shots over,
[23:11.000 --> 23:14.000]  we got a skeleton crew in today because the ice storm, they're doing a great job,
[23:14.000 --> 23:20.000]  but you can either scan over the articles is how I like it, or you don't have to follow me around,
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  I'll always show you an article right here.
[23:22.000 --> 23:27.000]  So if I pick one up out of the stack, if you just aim right here, right here,
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  then I will, I'll put it right there for folks, okay?
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  So let me get back to that now.
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.000]  See right here, we hear all about the white supremacist or the number one threat,
[23:36.000 --> 23:43.000]  not the Mexican drug cartels, not MS-13, not the communist Chinese, not radical Islam, no.
[23:43.000 --> 23:48.000]  White people are inherently evil, and white people are inherently bad,
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  and being white is inherently a bad thing.
[23:50.000 --> 23:54.000]  You see that taught the schools, taught everywhere by the Marxist, Leninist leftists
[23:54.000 --> 23:58.000]  that are using that as their divide and conquer strategy.
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.000]  DHS, you said a couple of years ago, the number one threat was white supremacist,
[24:01.000 --> 24:05.000]  now that's official, and what is white supremacist?
[24:05.000 --> 24:12.000]  White supremacist is questioning open borders, questioning forced injections,
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.000]  questioning lockdowns, or questioning election fraud.
[24:16.000 --> 24:21.000]  Homeland security, emerging threat, domestic terrorism, and white supremacy,
[24:21.000 --> 24:27.000]  but now the FBI director says, oh my goodness, goody-goody gumdrops,
[24:27.000 --> 24:31.000]  we've got Chinese spies in the universities and the media and government,
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.000]  and they've basically taken over, because the left was controlling China
[24:36.000 --> 24:42.000]  using them as a base of operations to do that, just like they had used offshore spies
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.000]  out of Israel to engage in some of their takeover operations and MI6 out of the UK.
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  That's a classic thing, in fact, when the Germans want somebody killed,
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.000]  they'll have USCIA killers go to kill the Germans,
[24:56.000 --> 24:59.000]  and when an American wants somebody killed inside the power structure,
[24:59.000 --> 25:04.000]  they'll hire usually the Germans, but they hired the Germans to blow up Oklahoma City,
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  the Southern Property Law Center and FBI and ATF did.
[25:07.000 --> 25:12.000]  So it's the same thing, because you always go over and do it in somebody else's yard
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  so there's even more plausible deniability with those teams.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  So there you go.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  Oh, and by the way, there were some good FBI agents that came out and blew the whistle on that
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  and what really happened, and now they had videotapes of the men inside the building
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.000]  putting the bombs in, and now they disappeared those videotapes of the explosion
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  coming from inside the building.
[25:31.000 --> 25:34.000]  That even came out in the LA Times back in the late 90s,
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.000]  back when we still had some free press in the corporate media in this nation.
[25:38.000 --> 25:42.000]  But that all ties in to Whoopi Goldberg,
[25:42.000 --> 25:47.000]  and she says she may just leave the view because, why, she's got a Jewish last name
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.000]  and the ADL loves her and she believes, you know, that leftist Jewish organizations
[25:53.000 --> 25:57.000]  cannot be questioned and whatever they say has to go
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  because they represent supposedly Jews and then if you don't do what they say,
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.000]  you are Hitler, you carried out the Holocaust.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  That's how, and what young white children are told, you're inherently bad because you're white.
[26:08.000 --> 26:14.000]  And so she's a little upset now, but remember what the ADL told us last year
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  and again in statements last week, racism is only a thing of white people
[26:20.000 --> 26:27.000]  and brown people cannot be tribal or in gangs and cannot target whites because they're white,
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  plus whites are bad and deserve it.
[26:29.000 --> 26:35.000]  So Whoopi Goldberg went off the latest download from the head of the ADL
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  who even though he came on and she groveled to him and everything, it's not enough,
[26:40.000 --> 26:49.000]  but she was following the new ADL directive from on high that racism is anything white.
[26:49.000 --> 26:55.000]  And so she said, well, you can't have white Germans killing white Jews.
[26:55.000 --> 27:01.000]  So that'd be racism because whites cannot be ever persecuted by a racist attack.
[27:01.000 --> 27:02.000]  I mean, the ADL said so.
[27:02.000 --> 27:09.000]  So she went and said, no, the ultimate crime in history is not the Jews getting killed
[27:09.000 --> 27:13.000]  because other whites killed them and whites are inherently bad.
[27:13.000 --> 27:20.000]  And they're like, whoa, Disney came out and said, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  You cannot do that. Do not do that.
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  You can teach five-year-old white kids in Indiana they're bad
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.000]  and six-year-old white kids in Austin, Texas, but you don't say that Jews are white
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  because whites are the devil.
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  I mean, they're all the Nazis that have got to be, but see how the racism works,
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  all it is is gang tribalism, the same way groups control prisons where you have the Hispanics,
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.000]  the Asians, the blacks, the whites.
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.000]  And you're forced into that in general population or you're killed.
[27:50.000 --> 27:56.000]  And that's how they're dividing and conquering culture in the name of unity creating total division.
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  Racism, interim definition.
[27:59.000 --> 28:04.000]  Racism occurs when individuals or institutions show more favorable evaluation
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.000]  or treatment of an individual or group based on race or ethnicity.
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  And it goes on in the ADL.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  That's the old ADL definition.
[28:14.000 --> 28:19.000]  When we come back, we'll show you the new definition that talks about being white.
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  Guys, I wanted the definition printed.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  Oh, they changed it back.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  Okay, then we'll go to rebroadcast.
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  No problem. I will get on the way back machine.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  We're going to get some rebroadcasting coming up today, baby.
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  And then I'm going to bring you in and show you this and dig it out of all my stacks.
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  There's articles everywhere about it.
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.000]  It was all over the news.
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  They changed the definition.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  I need it.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  I'm going to cover it.
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.000]  I'm going to go over it.
[28:44.000 --> 28:45.000]  I'm going to lay it out.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  It's going to happen straight ahead.
[28:47.000 --> 28:48.000]  It's not going to get stopped.
[28:48.000 --> 28:49.000]  Doesn't matter.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  We'll be right back.
[28:51.000 --> 29:18.000]  God.
[29:22.000 --> 29:27.000]  The enemy knows it's powerful and wants to keep you in a psychological, spiritual prison.
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  This gives you the tools to break out of that system.
[29:30.000 --> 29:34.000]  This points out the tools that God created and has already given you,
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.000]  but that most people forgot or never discovered.

[33:24.000 --> 33:33.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:33.000 --> 33:40.000]  Well also, if you're going to do this, then let's be truthful about it because the Holocaust isn't about race.
[33:40.000 --> 33:41.000]  No.
[33:41.000 --> 33:42.000]  No.
[33:42.000 --> 33:43.000]  It's not about race.
[33:43.000 --> 33:44.000]  Maybe it's the city.
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  No, let me sit and use a different race.
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.000]  But it's not about race.
[33:49.000 --> 33:50.000]  What is it about?
[33:50.000 --> 33:55.000]  Because it's about man's inhumanity to man.
[33:55.000 --> 33:56.000]  That's what it's about.
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.000]  But it's about white supremacy.
[33:58.000 --> 34:01.000]  Well, it's not about race.
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  But these are two white groups of people.
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  Well, that's what we have to blame.
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.000]  But you're missing the point.
[34:08.000 --> 34:12.000]  The minute you turn it into race, it goes down this alley.
[34:12.000 --> 34:14.000]  Let's talk about it for what it is.
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.000]  It's how people treat each other.
[34:16.000 --> 34:17.000]  It's a problem.
[34:17.000 --> 34:25.000]  It doesn't matter if you're black or white because black, white, Jews, everybody eats each other.
[34:25.000 --> 34:31.000]  So if you're uncomfortable, if you hear about mouse, should you be worried?
[34:31.000 --> 34:34.000]  Should your child say, oh my God, I wonder if that's me?
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  No, that's not what they're going to say.
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  They're going to say, I don't want to be like that.
[34:38.000 --> 34:39.000]  Well, hopefully.
[34:39.000 --> 34:40.000]  Well, I want to be cool.
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  Yeah, most kids, most kids, they don't want to be cool.
[34:44.000 --> 34:51.000]  No, we're living in an era where people are comparing vaccine cards to the yellow stars,
[34:51.000 --> 34:55.000]  where people are comparing vaccinations to what Anne Frank went through.
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.000]  So it is necessary for kids to learn about what they're all about.
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.000]  To learn about man's inhumanity to man, however it exposes itself.
[35:04.000 --> 35:05.000]  I have to cut you off.
[35:05.000 --> 35:11.000]  I just want to say that mouse was banned and it flew to top 20 of Amazon's rules, lastly, of charts.
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.000]  The more you ban this, the more we want to read it.
[35:15.000 --> 35:21.000]  Man, who could listen to that jabbering, yipping group of mindless idiots?
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  So she's a high priestess because she's a black woman.
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  Everybody else is below her and bad because the wider you are, the more inherently evil you are.
[35:30.000 --> 35:34.000]  You've been taught that by the ADL that's here to fight racism.
[35:34.000 --> 35:37.000]  But then you can't say Jews are white.
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  You've now said they're the devil.
[35:39.000 --> 35:44.000]  So you've now got to be taken off the air.
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.000]  And this is just evil, globalist, corporate leftist,
[35:47.000 --> 35:52.000]  knowing that Christian Western nations invented not being tribal
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.000]  and invented bringing different groups together and giving people equal rights.
[35:56.000 --> 36:02.000]  So our strength was that, but that our culture was dominant, the Renaissance culture.
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  And the globalists don't want that.
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.000]  So they come in and pose as that classical liberal structure,
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  where, yeah, you can be your own group or your own system,
[36:10.000 --> 36:15.000]  but Western Christian systems are superior to everything else that's been developed,
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  and you should want to adopt this.
[36:17.000 --> 36:23.000]  Now, as we have not adopted the Western culture, we're falling apart and being destroyed.
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  China is one of the other powerful, very superior cultures
[36:27.000 --> 36:30.000]  when it comes to organization and history, 5,000-plus years old,
[36:30.000 --> 36:33.000]  and they're celebrating their system.
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.000]  And that's why George Soros is pissed,
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  because, oh no, you've got a culture.
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.000]  You aren't run by me and the globalist.
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  So that's all this is.
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  And I just had whiplash last segment,
[36:47.000 --> 36:52.000]  because last year they changed the definition of it.
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  And again, the ADL is the boss, so they say it.
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.000]  If they say the moon's made of cheese, it is.
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  They came out and changed it again and said,
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  and I've got the quotes right here,
[37:06.000 --> 37:13.000]  racism, the marginalization and opposition and oppression of people of color
[37:13.000 --> 37:18.000]  based on socially constructed racial hierarchy that privileges white people.
[37:18.000 --> 37:19.000]  I'll read that again.
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  The marginalization and or oppression of people of color
[37:23.000 --> 37:31.000]  based on a societal, constructed racial hierarchy that privileges white people.
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  Now, let's talk about that.
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.000]  That's the new definition that got all the attention in the last few weeks
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.000]  after we covered it.
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  And here's the then and now.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  Before a few weeks ago, racism is the belief
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  that a peculiar race is superior or inferior to another
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  and that a person's social and moral traits are predominated
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.000]  by his or her own inborn biological characteristics.
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.000]  Racial separatism is the belief most of the time based on racism
[37:58.000 --> 38:03.000]  that different races should remain segregated and apart from one another.
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.000]  Which is really a definition of tribalism,
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  which is what they call racism invented by the communists 80 years ago
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  as a way to create social disorder in the West.
[38:12.000 --> 38:15.000]  Now, here's the new definition that they just changed back.
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.000]  The marginalization and or oppression of people of color based on
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  societal, constructed racial hierarchy that privileges white people.
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  Racism is only white people.
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.000]  Then they changed it again.
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, and I just read that definition earlier.
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  Racism, interim definition.
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  Now they're telling you they're going to change it all the time.
[38:39.000 --> 38:40.000]  The goalpost always move.
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.000]  Racism occurs when individuals or institutions show more favorable
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  evaluation or treatment to an individual or group based on race and ethnicity.
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  Professor Robert Livingston, the conversation.
[38:49.000 --> 38:52.000]  For more about the definition, click here.
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.000]  So it's a little too much for the ADL to come out and say whiteness is evil.
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.000]  Now let's just talk reality here.
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.000]  There are good Catholics and there are bad Catholics.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  There are good Baptists and there are bad Baptists.
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  There are good Jews and there are bad Jews.
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  We've all met people that are great, that are Catholic.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  We've met Catholics and aren't so great.
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  We've met Jews that are wonderful people.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  We've met Jews that aren't wonderful people.
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  So to try to think as you're part of a group, that's really mindless to say
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  we're going to judge you off that group.
[39:20.000 --> 39:30.000]  But the only group in the world as ethno-pure as the Chinese is the Jews.
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  I mean the Chinese genetically select 99% of their Chinese.
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  The Chinese are proud of their ancient culture.
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  The Jews are proud of their ancient culture.
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  They have a big 100-foot wall around their little country
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  because they have tribal, ancient enemies.
[39:45.000 --> 39:50.000]  You could pick any side you want that do want to displace them and kill them.
[39:50.000 --> 39:55.000]  And so you could call that an apartheid state if you want.
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.000]  I'm not defending the apartheid state of South Africa,
[39:58.000 --> 40:03.000]  but now they replace one bad system with one 10 times worse communism
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  and the big corporations totally looting everybody
[40:05.000 --> 40:08.000]  because the big banks don't want a middle class.
[40:08.000 --> 40:11.000]  And so Israel has an ethno-state
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  more intense than the most intense South African system.
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  In fact, put that back on screen.
[40:17.000 --> 40:21.000]  Those are conservative, ultra-orthodox are called Jews
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.000]  and they choose to like their system and their culture
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  and they want to keep it that way and that's their right.
[40:27.000 --> 40:30.000]  Now, do I call that an SS Nazi meeting?
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  Because they're wearing uniforms, they're one racial group
[40:33.000 --> 40:38.000]  and they believe that they have gotten divine direction from God that makes them special,
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  which I don't have a problem with.
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.000]  I think all humans have their own special traits and special things in groups
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  and I think celebrating our connection to God consciousness and the divine is a good thing
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.000]  and I have learned a lot from the Old Testament and Judaism
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  and the writings of rabbis and people.
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  I think it's very rich, very powerful stuff,
[40:57.000 --> 41:02.000]  but are there some really evil, wicked Jews and wicked Jewish mafia out there?
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.000]  Absolutely. The Jewish mafia created the ADL in 1913
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  when a pedophile raped and killed a little girl
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  and they didn't like the fact that he got in trouble
[41:09.000 --> 41:12.000]  so they said we're founding this organization to do this.
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  And that's who the ADL is.
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.000]  And it's an evil organization, it's very anti-American
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.000]  who gives awards to George Soros, a Nazi collaborator
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  and awards to Arnold Schwarzenegger, who on record told Rolling Stone,
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  he loves Hitler.
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.000]  I don't love Hitler. I researched Hitler.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  I don't think Hitler's cool.
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  I know Hitler killed a bunch of people including a bunch of Jews
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  and I think that's wrong.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  But I will not now take on the identity of Hitler
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.000]  because the official terrorism perspective of the FBI
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  and Joe Biden is, I think the election was stolen
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  and I don't like open borders and I don't like forced inoculations.
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  You say I am a white supremacist.
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.000]  That is the definition of that is someone that doesn't turn my body over to you.
[41:54.000 --> 41:59.000]  So when I look around and I try to find something that's ghoulish
[41:59.000 --> 42:04.000]  and un-American and authoritarian, the ADL fits the bill.
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  The Southern Poverty Law Center fits the bill.
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.000]  So I don't care if the Southern Poverty Law Center is a bunch of liberal lawyers
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  of every group or I don't care if the ADL is a bunch of, you know,
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  weird power-hungry leftists.
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.000]  I don't care what you're, where you go to church or synagogue.
[42:20.000 --> 42:23.000]  I'm not your slave and I'm not associated with Hitler.
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  And I almost don't exist because both my grandfathers
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  almost died in World War II in the Army Air Corps
[42:28.000 --> 42:34.000]  and I'm pissed off at you for you trying to put the identity of Hitler on to me
[42:34.000 --> 42:40.000]  when your leader George Soros literally suckled at the tits of Adolf Hitler.
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.000]  Rounding up and killing your people
[42:43.000 --> 42:47.000]  and you project your sick, freakish, neural order evil on me?
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  No!
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  How dare you divide people?
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  How dare you try to hurt people?
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  How dare you become Hitler?
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  The ADL is Adolf Alois Hitler incarnate.
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.000]  This gives you the tools to break out of that system.
[43:29.000 --> 43:33.000]  This points out the tools that God created and has already given you
[43:33.000 --> 43:36.000]  but that most people forgot or never discovered.
[43:36.000 --> 43:40.000]  Besetwars.com right now has this course.

[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  This is the most important information I've ever put out
[43:52.000 --> 43:55.000]  and it's available exclusively at resetwars.com
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  for 50% off for 72 hours.
[43:57.000 --> 44:26.000]  Resetwars.com
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  For sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.000]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.000]  They started a fight with you.
[44:37.000 --> 44:40.000]  And they're not gonna back down and they're not gonna go away
[44:40.000 --> 44:43.000]  and they're not going to ever stop their attacks
[44:43.000 --> 44:46.000]  until they have the fear of God put into them.
[44:46.000 --> 44:49.000]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order
[44:49.000 --> 44:52.000]  or about globalism or about corporate taxes
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  and it's not until people understand that
[44:54.000 --> 44:58.000]  that we're under attack we have any chance of beating these people.
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.000]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  against the globalist.
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[45:06.000 --> 45:09.000]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  before they went operational.
[45:11.000 --> 45:12.000]  But we failed.
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed,
[45:16.000 --> 45:19.000]  but they are going ahead with their full operational
[45:19.000 --> 45:22.000]  deindustrialization great reset.
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.000]  that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  about the show because people are ready to wake up
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  and ready to hear the truth.
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[45:33.000 --> 45:34.000]  and trying to stop their agenda.
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality
[45:38.000 --> 45:39.000]  storable food.
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.000]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.000]  or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[45:49.000 --> 45:52.000]  Locker orders in before food prices go up
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  and before there are long lines and waits
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  because believe me, serious times are coming.
[45:56.000 --> 46:25.000]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  And it's been four years since my patriot supply
[46:30.000 --> 46:33.000]  at preparewithalix.com has offered their storable food
[46:33.000 --> 46:37.000]  at 25% off four years.
[46:37.000 --> 46:42.000]  But right now it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022.
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.000]  A little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  to get 25% off at preparewithalix.com
[46:48.000 --> 46:52.000]  on the entire catalog of my patriot supply.
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  Act now, get prepared now.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  This is absolutely essential for everybody
[46:56.000 --> 47:25.000]  that wants to be self-sufficient.
[47:25.000 --> 47:28.000]  I get mad at the social engineers.
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  I get mad when I sit down and I read the WikiLeaks documents
[47:30.000 --> 47:33.000]  five, six years ago, where they talk about
[47:33.000 --> 47:35.000]  how they're going to use social engineering
[47:35.000 --> 47:38.000]  and social division and racism to control us.
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.000]  I mean, it's cold-blooded, whether it's CNN
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  or whether it's ABC News or whether it's NBC News
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.000]  or whether it's the ADL or whether it's the colleges.
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  It's all the Carnegie Endowment.
[47:48.000 --> 47:49.000]  It's the Ford Foundation.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  It's the Rockefeller Foundation.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  It's Bill and Melinda Gates.
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  They want division and then they pose as the warden
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.000]  of the prison once they've divided us into racial groups
[47:59.000 --> 48:02.000]  and they quote, take control of our lives
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  as the arbiter, as the referee.
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  And we need to wake up to it and say no.
[48:08.000 --> 48:13.000]  But, you know, it's pretty offensive to sit there
[48:13.000 --> 48:17.000]  and say the ADL is Adolf Alois Hitler.
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  But Hitler censored and Hitler tried to take
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  people's bank accounts away and Hitler called
[48:21.000 --> 48:26.000]  the rest of his opposition and Hitler based things on race.
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  And that's what the ADL does now.
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  I mean, if you actually take the policies
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  and things they stand for and what they want,
[48:32.000 --> 48:40.000]  man, they're closer to Hitler than they are to the average American.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  Think about how they teach in schools
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  that being white is inherently evil.
[48:44.000 --> 48:45.000]  We have the manuals.
[48:45.000 --> 48:46.000]  We have the training.
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  You see it all over the news.
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.000]  That is the opposite of what Martin Luther King said.
[48:51.000 --> 48:54.000]  Martin Luther King was over here.
[48:54.000 --> 48:58.000]  Here's a diagram on one side saying don't judge somebody
[48:58.000 --> 49:03.000]  according to what color they are, but according to their deeds.
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  And then on the opposite side over here,
[49:05.000 --> 49:12.000]  you've got Hitler saying only judge somebody off of their background,
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.000]  what color they are, what their genetic makeup is.
[49:16.000 --> 49:21.000]  Don't give somebody the potential to try to do greater things.
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  Just say they're subhuman.
[49:23.000 --> 49:26.000]  So Martin Luther King Jr. said judge people on the character
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  of their deeds and what they stand for.
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  Again, I've used this analogy a thousand times.
[49:30.000 --> 49:31.000]  It's true.
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.000]  I don't care who owns a restaurant or what color they are
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.000]  as long as the food's delicious and healthy.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  I don't care who's playing the music,
[49:40.000 --> 49:43.000]  whether they're an Arab or whether they are a Jew
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  or whether they're black or white or Asian.
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  If I like the music, I'm buying it, I'm listening to it.
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  We're all like that.
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.000]  We judge a tree by its fruits as Jesus Christ said.
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.000]  Jesus said judge a tree by its fruits.
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  Don't just judge the book by its cover.
[50:00.000 --> 50:06.000]  The ADL says no, being white is inherently a sin.
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  And Whoopi Goldberg comes out and says,
[50:08.000 --> 50:13.000]  well, then you can't have racism because you can't have one white group
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  because you're judging them by the color of their skin,
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  killing another white group for dominance and control,
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  which is tribalism.
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  I mean, you've got plenty of cases of British royals
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  killing their brothers and sisters or killing their nephews
[50:25.000 --> 50:28.000]  because they might have a better claim to the throne than them.
[50:28.000 --> 50:29.000]  That's their genetic line.
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  They kill people and their families
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  because grizzly bears kill their own babies
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  because they're threatened by them.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  They kill the males.
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.000]  This goes on.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  Hell over in Israel there, they assassinate each other.
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  We assassinate each other over here.
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  Humans all act the same.
[50:46.000 --> 50:51.000]  It's tribalism and Christianity through the Christian ethos of the Renaissance
[50:51.000 --> 50:54.000]  says let's start judging people by the heart and the soul
[50:54.000 --> 50:55.000]  and by the fruit of the tree
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  and let's try to come together under Christ,
[50:58.000 --> 51:03.000]  which is an exclusive form.
[51:03.000 --> 51:07.000]  Jesus said, I came not to discard the Old Testament but to fulfill it.
[51:07.000 --> 51:11.000]  So an expansion of Judaism to everyone.
[51:11.000 --> 51:14.000]  That's why people say, don't say Christian, you know,
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  Judeo-Christian history.
[51:16.000 --> 51:19.000]  No, it is Judeo-Christian history.
[51:19.000 --> 51:22.000]  And so recognize those good parts and celebrate that
[51:22.000 --> 51:26.000]  and then don't let weird, horrible globalists say they're the Jews
[51:26.000 --> 51:29.000]  and say they represent all the Jews
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  and then say you've got to do what they say,
[51:31.000 --> 51:34.000]  turn your guns in, take shots, open borders up,
[51:34.000 --> 51:35.000]  be bad because you're white,
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  let people tell you you're evil because of what color you are
[51:37.000 --> 51:40.000]  because you'll be called a Nazi.
[51:40.000 --> 51:45.000]  That's how the Nazis took control with racial gangs and tribalism.
[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  That's Hitler hated Christians.
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  Hitler couldn't stand it.
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  He didn't like that.
[51:52.000 --> 51:58.000]  He saw Christianity as the biggest threat to his Neo-Pagan Reich he wanted to form.
[51:58.000 --> 52:01.000]  So what does the ADL on the left have in common with that old Hitler?
[52:01.000 --> 52:04.000]  There is pagan as the day is long.
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  If you think the head of the ADL is actually a practicing Jew,
[52:07.000 --> 52:11.000]  I got a bridge I'm ready to sell you.
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  People like Dr. Zelinko are practicing Jews
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.000]  and he understands God consciousness and we're all together
[52:16.000 --> 52:19.000]  and he has a desire for us all to be together in peace and justice under God
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  and that's absolutely true.
[52:21.000 --> 52:24.000]  So there are counterfeits, ladies and gentlemen, of the real thing
[52:24.000 --> 52:27.000]  and a Dr. Zelinko is a real Jew.
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  The head of the ADL, whatever he is,
[52:29.000 --> 52:34.000]  he's not following the God of the Bible.
[52:34.000 --> 52:39.000]  He is creating an occultic pagan world
[52:39.000 --> 52:44.000]  and they are selling us racism in the name of fighting racism
[52:44.000 --> 52:49.000]  because we are tribal and in our ancient times we had to get together in groups
[52:49.000 --> 52:52.000]  over which side of the river we lived in or what God we worshiped or whatever
[52:52.000 --> 52:55.000]  because we didn't organize and another group could come and enslave us.
[52:55.000 --> 52:58.000]  So we have those instincts and the social engineers
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  and I don't want to just say the ADL is the only big one,
[53:00.000 --> 53:04.000]  it's a bunch of them, are all ganging up big rich corporations
[53:04.000 --> 53:08.000]  to divide and conquer us and I am fundamentally tired of it
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  and whoopie Goldberg should get pissed too.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  She's been a total liberal leftist,
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  pushed the whole America's races in bad crap her whole life,
[53:15.000 --> 53:18.000]  worshipped the ADL, got no orders from the ADL,
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  even had the head of the ADL and said,
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  no, no, no, don't cancel her.
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.000]  She followed the new definition
[53:25.000 --> 53:28.000]  and they only changed the definition yesterday, you notice that?
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  They changed the word whiplash earlier,
[53:30.000 --> 53:34.000]  they changed it three times last year from being white is racist
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  and whoopie was following her directive,
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  she's like, yes, whites are evil,
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  so you can't have one white group killing another white group,
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  this was just people being bad to people
[53:43.000 --> 53:46.000]  because you can't have whites ever being persecuted
[53:46.000 --> 53:49.000]  because now the globalists want to base civilization around that,
[53:49.000 --> 53:54.000]  the super rich elite organizing the majority that they call a minority
[53:54.000 --> 53:58.000]  who do attacking whiteness, which they then label free market, jobs,
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  police, security as white,
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  so you get rid of all that and become a slave,
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  you destroy your own birthright of being a westerner
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  by adopting western systems
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  and we'll adopt some of the eastern things
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  and some of the African things,
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  but the point is, is the globalists are at war
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  with the Renaissance program
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  that was growing and developing us to the stars,
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  so they brought in their post-industrial
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  neo-pegans system to destroy the new Atlantis,
[54:25.000 --> 54:28.000]  to destroy the new launch.
[54:28.000 --> 54:33.000]  This is a reset like God in the flood
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  except Klaus Schwab, talk about a Nazi,
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  talk about a eugenicist, talk about an elitist,
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  you're gonna hear a damn word out of the ADL,
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  they wanted to point out a real elitist
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  starving tens of millions of people who had lockdowns
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  and all the tyranny, they'd say Klaus Schwab,
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  oh no, Klaus Schwab is wonderful
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  because Klaus Schwab is above the ADL.
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  But Americans know we fought Hitler
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  so we don't want to be called Hitler,
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  so we'll do whatever the ADL says
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  because please don't call me Hitler,
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  but it doesn't work anymore
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  because people know that's a load of crap
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  and they're sick of it.
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  So people need to stop being bullied by the left
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  and political correctness, stop being scared of it,
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  it's the new religion and we have to get back
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  in the face of the left pushing it as the real racist
[55:15.000 --> 55:21.000]  using it as cold-blooded political control.
[55:21.000 --> 55:24.000]  And that's why I get so angry about all of this.
[55:24.000 --> 55:29.000]  Imagine the ADL waking up and going,
[55:29.000 --> 55:30.000]  oh my God, everybody's pointing out
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  that we're saying whites are inherently bad
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  and that racism can only be whites
[55:35.000 --> 55:40.000]  attacking other groups, which is an asinine.
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  People call it reverse racism, it's not reverse racism,
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  it's not like whites invented tribalism,
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  it's tribalism and our tribe is going to be Jesus
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.000]  or our tribe is going to be nuclear war and death.
[55:52.000 --> 55:57.000]  Pick wisely, pick Jesus of Nazareth
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.000]  or pick the old serpent.
[56:00.000 --> 56:06.000]  Beelzebub, the devil, Lucifer.
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  We're going to go to break, we've got so much to hit.
[56:08.000 --> 56:11.000]  Oh, a young U.S. senator took the shot.
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  Having a horrible stroke,
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  talking about all that, a bunch of more heart attacks
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  and deaths and sports from the shots.
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  Yeah, we're getting exterminated.
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  But don't worry though, five-year-old white kids
[56:21.000 --> 56:24.000]  of the threat, not the New World Order,
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  not the depopulation, it's just listen to the ADL
[56:26.000 --> 56:29.000]  who is busy beavers trying to debank us
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  and shut us down and silence us,
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  which the last time I saw that was in the Soviet Union
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  and in Nazi Germany.
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  Again, just another feather in their cap of evil.
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  So please support us, get a t-shirt, get a book, get a film.
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  The highest quality, swarble food ready to ship to you

[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  you really need to experience X3.
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it,
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  I know you're going to be reordering it,
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  but particularly those that haven't ever tried the product,
[58:40.000 --> 58:43.000]  you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body,
[58:43.000 --> 58:46.000]  it's a bad halogen, and it funds the info war,

[58:47.000 --> 58:51.000]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off at limited time.
[58:51.000 --> 58:52.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[58:52.000 --> 58:54.000]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[58:54.000 --> 58:55.000]  Welcome.
[58:55.000 --> 58:56.000]  Hello, Alex.
[58:56.000 --> 58:57.000]  Yes, Malcolm.
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.000]  All right, I will make this quick and real short
[58:59.000 --> 59:00.000]  where the other patrons can get on the line.
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  Alex, I have to promote one thing
[59:02.000 --> 59:05.000]  from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer,
[59:05.000 --> 59:08.000]  SuperMailVitality and Brainforce Plus.
[59:08.000 --> 59:11.000]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[59:11.000 --> 59:13.000]  SuperMailVitality really, really works.
[59:13.000 --> 59:16.000]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[59:16.000 --> 59:18.000]  that have never been heated up,
[59:18.000 --> 59:22.000]  and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[59:22.000 --> 59:24.000]  They also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.000]  This is like a very fine wine.
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  In fact, each batch is different.
[59:28.000 --> 59:31.000]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[59:31.000 --> 59:32.000]  People are like, why are you selling something
[59:32.000 --> 59:34.000]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[59:34.000 --> 59:35.000]  That's just how it is.
[59:35.000 --> 59:36.000]  It's how it works.
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  So it's always good.
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[59:40.000 --> 59:43.000]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price,
[59:43.000 --> 59:44.000]  then this is it.
[59:53.000 --> 59:56.000]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[59:56.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  you are the Resistance.
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios,
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  Our future can be extremely bright.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  It's where every human is able to flourish and prosper,
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  so they can enjoy the world in a way God intended.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  However, the future can also be very dark.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  Which path society ends up going down
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  is dependent on you together.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  Yes, you watching this video.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  You see, what you have to realize
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  is that you're part of something so vast
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  that it's hard to comprehend.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  I know when you look at an evil and large group
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  of powerful individuals, you may think,
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  what difference does it make what I say or what I do?
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  And that's exactly what these sick and twisted elites
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  with the demonic agenda want you to think.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  They want you to think that you don't matter,
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  but you do.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  In fact, you're amazing.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  And that their plan is invincible,
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  but it's not.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  They're not invincible.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  But enough people take matters into their own
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  spiritual and personal hands
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  and make the decision that they can make a difference
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  and they can fight back against the corrupt powers in charge.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  Then without a doubt, we can defeat these power hungry elites.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  Now the question is, how do we do this?
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  How can you make sure they don't win?
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  Well, that's why I'm here talking to you today.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  I urge you to do what's right and prepare yourself today.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  Make no mistake about it.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  We're currently in an all out war for freedom,
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  a war against our free will and our consciousness.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  And this war is only going to get more intense as time goes on
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  because they know humanity's waking up.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  Do you want to be remembered as the person that fought back
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  and defended their freedom and others' freedom?
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  Or do you want to be remembered as the person who sat on the sidelines
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  waiting to see what happened?
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  And once you make that decision,
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  you'll realize that you're now a champion fighting for all of our freedom.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  Begin your journey to true freedom today at resetwars.com.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  Inside you, like me, fire is burning. Something needs to change.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  I just want to reach out and give a recommendation to reset wars.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  It's really powerful.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  Reset wars was absolutely amazing and eye-opening and revolutionary.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  If you want to change your life for the better,
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  I highly recommend this to Alex.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  Thank you very much for putting the course together.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  I found it to be awesome. It was worth it to me.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  You have taken ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  and crystallized it with scientific knowledge.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  This isn't about Alex Jones.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  What you're about to see is a lengthy, powerful, well-documented spectrum
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  of information and experiences and understanding
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  that the power structure is censoring and is definitely afraid of.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  To think the way we were intended to think by God.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  That's what this series is about.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  Reset wars has been a great tool during this time of uncertainty
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  and it has rejuvenated my hope.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  It's been helping me a lot with a lot that's going on in my life.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  Everybody needs to purchase this product and watch it
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  and then share the information far and wide.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  There is an awakening. Join in to help yourself and others to wake up.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  Reset wars has been a great tool in both recapping
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  what I've come to already know and also learn new material.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  I'm not disappointed.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  I plan on sharing it with as many people as possible.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  I hear you coming more and more with that
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  and I feel it more and more. It's moving me.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  We need to have courage and focus in order to accomplish that mission
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  and I felt like I got a lot of that from Reset Wars as well.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  The confidence and hope gained from Reset Wars is priceless.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  This isn't magic. This is the real code of the universe
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  or what Max Plank 120-plus years ago called The Matrix.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  Start your journey to true freedom now at resetwars.com.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  I want to thank everybody that has gotten the course
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  and those folks did amazing reviews. God bless you.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  And it really is incredibly powerful information
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  and it funds the info war.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  So thank you all for your support.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  It's 50% off right now at resetwars.com.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  It's really powerful and wants to keep you in a psychological,
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  spiritual prison.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  This gives you the tools to break out of that system.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  This points out the tools that God created
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  and has already given you,
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  but that most people forgot or never discovered.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  Resetwars.com right now has this course.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  Seven hours long, four, 50% off,
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  and your purchase funds the info war.
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  So it's a 360 win.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  This is the most important information I've ever put out
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  and it's available exclusively at resetwars.com
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  for 50% off for 72 hours.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  Resetwars.com.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  All right, we're going to open the phones up here today,
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  specifically on what you think about the state of the world
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  and what you think they're going to do about Biden
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  and their whole globalist program falling apart.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  Now I had said I was going to take some calls today
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  and I'm going to take some limited ones because
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  we have some major breaking news concerning the Pentagon AI project
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  confirming massive death and illnesses from those taking the shots.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  So a guest is going to pop in with that information at the bottom of the hour.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  Then I'll continue on with some of your calls.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  And then we also have a former NBA player who's been very outspoken
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  about the Uyghur situation, the censorship in the NBA
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  joining us coming up for part of the third hour as well
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  ahead of Paul Joseph Watson.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  But the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  We're doing first-time callers again, 877-789-2539.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  Let's just get about seven, eight callers on the board.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  So I'll be able to get to those and I want to hear from them,
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  but I can't get to them any more than that
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  because there's some big news broke that we didn't know about
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  that we've got to get on here, though I want to take your calls.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  And I want to tell listeners again, starting in March,
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  just like we did last Saturday for two hours, commercial free,
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  took like 20 phone calls, had three guests on,
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  quick, bam, bam, bam, members of parliament, you name it,
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  up cover in the trucker convoy, Ezra Levant and others.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  I'm going to be doing at least two nights a week
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  and at least on Saturday, most Saturdays,
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  a lot of times on Sundays as well, a separate show,
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  so at least three times a week, that are going to be commercial free
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  podcast for people and then folks are going to be able to tune in
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  and just call in and just a call after call after call after call.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  Nothing against talk radio, I love it.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  We're on over 300 radio stations, they try to de-platform us
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  and take us off air.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  We only survived as we built back up our internet presence
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  because of the AMFM stations, they're awesome.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  And the average radio show has 14 minutes of ads an hour
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  and that's what we have, 14 minutes of ads an hour.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  And it's great, it helps our affiliates, it helps sponsors, all that.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  I'm going to keep doing this show I've been doing for 25 years in the slot.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  24 and a half years syndicated, yeah, in the slot.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  Talk radio needs to continue on, but as people migrate away from it
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  as it contracts, as it shuts down, except for a few major stations
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  and a few major markets in the next 5, 10 years, maybe even sooner,
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  we will then move and segue into a pure quote podcast format
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  if we're even still here, if we're able to back the globalist off,
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  stop them, slow them down.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  You know, it's all in God's will, but we trust in God,
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  but we were away from the rocks as Hunter S. Thompson said,
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  or that's kind of a rip-off of the Bedouin saying,
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  trust in God, but tie up your camel.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  God helps those that helps themselves.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  So that's where we are right now.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  And I sit here looking at all this news I've got
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  and I want to do a rant about the FBI director saying,
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  he suddenly discovered Chinese spies when we're just totally overrun.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  He was too busy saying white people are inherently bad
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  and the ADL spouting Hitlerian talking points for schoolchildren,
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  I have the training manuals right here,
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  that being white is inherently bad
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  and that you have guilt as a white person, original sin.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  I mean, this is just absolutely outrageous.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  ADL teaching schoolchildren only white people can be racist.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  They train the police departments,
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  they train the public schoolchildren,
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  as young as five years old that they're bad because they're white.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  I just can't think of a more abusive, sickening evil.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  And I don't want to dislike the ADL.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  I don't want to have people divided off of Judaism and the rest of it,
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  but the ADL is a leftist group that lives off of racism and division
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  and that lives off of people attacking Jews
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  and so that's going to make their business better
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  to brand the New World Order and all the evil stuff it's doing
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  as an ADL enterprise when it's not.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  And then you try to oppose any of the evil going on,
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  transgender training for kids, drag queen story time,
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  open borders, forced injections,
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  and the ADL's out there pushing censorship and control
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  and billions of dollars of bots spying on where you go
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  and what you do on Twitter and Instagram
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  and reporting it back and putting reports out about
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  where the general public goes
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  and helping publish names of concealed carry owners.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  I mean, you're a bunch of crazy, horrible bullies that know you are
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  and you're making your move against America.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  And I look at the tactics Hitler used,
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  race-based systems, gangs, thuggery, debunking, debanking,
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  and it's just wild to watch George Soros, who worked for Hitler,
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  now help finance and run the ADL, literally brand America as Hitler.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  I mean, we didn't work for Hitler, dude.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  We don't like Hitler like you.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  We don't create Hitlerian policies everywhere.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  And of course, George Soros knows that he's a complete
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  psychotic, sociopathic devil.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  It's just mind-blowing to realize that's going on.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  And you go off into the whole race division, divide and conquer,
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  tribalism crap, and it just gives you a headache.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  That's why I try to just stay out of it and away from it
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  and just expose the operations of the globalists.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  But man, we've got to protect our children from these race-mayors,
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  from these cult leaders.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  We've got to protect them from these shots.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  We've got to protect them from what these sinister
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  establishment people are doing.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  We have to recognize there's always been evil people in the world
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  of every race, color, and creed.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  They get together and they organize themselves to control good people.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  And good people have to organize themselves with a basic code
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  of freedom and liberty and then live by it and not let
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  monster authoritarians tell us we're all bad because we're white
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  so we have to bow down and worship Black Lives Matter
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  as the new religion.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  When it's not even black people, it's a weird, rich communist group
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  that's got $6 million communist command bases
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  and $4 million airfields.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  It's all horrible, selfish people appointing themselves
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  as the priest above you and saying they're good and they're pure
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  and they will show you how to be a good person
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  if you submit to them.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  It's truly disgusting.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  All right, let's take a phone call right now.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to folks in Pennsylvania.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  Tim and Pennsylvania, go ahead.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  I know they didn't go to you right away, Tim.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  It's okay, go ahead now, Tra.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  Hey, you there?
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  Yeah, go ahead.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  Hey, how are you doing?
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  I just like, I don't know, this is going crazy,
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  but I just want to bring up a point, you know,
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  you bring up a point about the ADL, man.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  It's like, we have to have an honest discussion.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  If you look at the COVID stuff, I mean,
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  so many of these people are Jewish, man.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  Well, yeah, the head of Pfizer is Jewish
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  and it is Bill Gates Jewish.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  I mean, my point is there's a lot of Jews opposing the tyranny.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  I mean, in fact, I'd say there's a predominant number
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  for their racial number of what, 2%,
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  or whatever I'd say there's an oversampling of Jews fighting
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  this tyranny as well.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  I agree.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  I mean, it's pretty sad.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  I have some Jewish friends, but I mean, it seems like...
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  I mean, let's just say this.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  Jews on average are in the game and some are in the game
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  for the bad guys and some are in the game for the good guys.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  That's why I judge people off what they do themselves.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  That's why I'm mad at the ADL.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  They want to organize us into racial groups
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  and tell me I'm bad because I'm white.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  No, you're Hitler telling me I'm bad because of what I'm coloring.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  You are Hitler.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  You are Hitler, not me.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  Don't you project your weird Hitler crap on me, ADL?
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  I agree.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  I'm totally with you.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  I think, though, it's important to look at, you know,
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  the precepts of Talmudic Judaism.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  They really are a supremacist kind of organization.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  It's not like the rabbinical.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  It's not the Torah.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  Like Dr. Zelenko...
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  Well, I mean, if you read the Old Testament,
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  it's go out and kill everybody that worships Molek
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  and eats their children.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  I mean, look, that's kind of manifest destiny for America.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  Every group that has done anything has said,
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  we're the best.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  We're going to do this.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  Well, yes, but I mean, I like the Old Testament.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  And I mean, I think what I'm reading there is,
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  hey, these people are eating their kids.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  Let's wipe them out.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  I mean, instead, we have the leftists
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  that literally want to eat the kids running things now.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  I mean, look, you're either pagan or you believe in God.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  Does that make sense?
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  No, absolutely.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  But Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  And I think it's all the problems that go away
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  if people would just accept Jesus Christ as the Son of God.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  You know, with the Muslims and Jesus...
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, absolutely.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  And accept God consciousness,
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  become conscious of God and God's will.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  I think we just got to be more...
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  You're not being afraid to call out the bad actors
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  in each group, you know.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  Absolutely.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  Listen, I mean, look, the media doesn't give an attention.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  You know how many Jews call out the ADL?
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  You think they want that group representing them?
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  I mean, you think the KKK represents me?
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  No, they don't.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  Sold out for months.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  X3 is now back in stock.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game-changing,
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  our products are game-changing,
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  It's not the soil anymore.
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  But when you get high-quality tri-iodine,
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  all three of the healthy types together,
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido,
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  but most importantly, your immune system.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  So, X3, the only tri-iodine on the market,
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  highest grade, is now exclusively available again
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  at 50%off at M4Short.com.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine,
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  and what it does for your body,
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  it takes about two weeks to get it on average,
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  you really need to experience X3.
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it,
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  I know you're going to be reordering it.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product,
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  And it funds the M4Short, a true 360 win.
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  So again, X3, back of stock, 50%off at limited time.
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  With all the craziness going on in the world,
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  with the globalists plotting their next big lockdown,
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  with the next phase of the Great Reset being a stage-cyber attack,
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  with the deep state pushing a civil war,
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  not just here, but in Europe and war with Russia,
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  with the massive inflation and all the other garbage
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  that's taking place, like supply chain right now,
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  you need to get prepared now with high-quality,
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  storable food that is ready to ship.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  And it's been four years since my Patriot supply
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  at PrepareWithAlex.com has offered their storable food
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  at 25%off, four years.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  But right now, it's 25%off until February 13th, 2022,
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  a little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  to get 25%off at PrepareWithAlex.com
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  on the entire catalog of my Patriot supply.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  Act now, get prepared now.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  This is absolutely essential for everybody
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  that wants to be self-sufficient.
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  with everything that's going on both at home
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  and the world at large.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  we could all use more of,
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  our new sleep support formula, Down and Out,
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  it's just the thing.
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  It's our new faster-absorbing liquid formula
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  that is specifically designed to help you
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  get the shut-eye you deserve.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product,
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  Knockout, with Down and Out,
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  now the herbs and melatonin packed inside
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  before you even take it.
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower,
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  Be sure to take this product
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  when you are completely ready for sleep
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  because you will be Down and Out.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  Get out now at InfoWarsStore.com
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  You buy this from the Mexican Rebels
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  and the price has never gone up.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  for about 50% more, per pound,
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  and I just think it's some of the best coffee
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  you're going to find anywhere.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  It's Wake Up America Patriot Blend
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  We had like that.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  You wouldn't believe it.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  Anyway, so it's InfoWarsStore.com
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  and that's how we fund this operation
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  and I don't want to say that's fine.
[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  of the New World Order,
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:16.000]  We got some really incredibly important COVID news
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  coming up with lawyer Tom Renz
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  next segment.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  We'll continue with your calls
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  and guests joining us.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:26.000]  Former NBA star and current MMA fighter
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  is doing a great job standing up against
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  globalist genocide.
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  There's been some very exciting developments.
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  I was already intending to talk about
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  Melinda French Gates
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  today and tie it into
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  Jeff Zucker
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  and how all of the pedophilia
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  stuff started to come out
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  because we never knew if she herself
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  was a eugenicist and she never made statements
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  about wanting to exterminate black people
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  and folks always wondered if she was a beard
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  for Gates, not because he could be
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  homosexual or bisexual, but a beard
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  just to make it look like he's married and a family man
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  but she is really coming
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  out against Gates
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  and so she's now pulling her money out of the foundation.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  So that is a big,
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  big, big deal.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  So that's coming up.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  Right now let's go to Stewie in Illinois
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  with a point about the UN Charter.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  Now Biden invited the UN and NATO in
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  when to find out more. We'll talk to Lisa and Josh
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  after him. Stewie, thanks for calling.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  Hey Alexman, it's good to talk to you.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  Alright, so I just learned this
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  and this kind of blew my mind a little bit.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  Article 6
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  of our Constitution says
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  any treaty that we will make
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  becomes part of the supreme law of the land.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  Now
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  Article 48 and 49
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  of the UN Charter requires
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  all member nations to carry out the decisions
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  of the Security Council
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  to maintain the maintenance
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  of international peace and security.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  Now Biden
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  invited these people in and I believe
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  that's all part of the disarm America movement
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  and they were used to saying it was to
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  investigate our racism.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  He did that earlier in the year.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  I just want to want you to think about that.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  You're absolutely right.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  All of this is about the UN being in charge.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  Remember what Loretta
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  Lynch did
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  right before Obama left office
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  five and a half years ago.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  Remember what happened?
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  They went to the UN and had a strong
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  cities convention. Henry Kissinger was there
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  George Solz was there. They had tears
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  in their eyes and they signed
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  the US cities under UN control
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  and promised to fire the police
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  and bring in UN-approved police
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  through a process called
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  Munialization.
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  And Schwarzenegger gave a speech saying
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  we will bring in the control
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  for the
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  carbon tax to the cities.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  Let's go what
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  presidents do, a congress
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  and so this is how they're taking over
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  everything is the UN
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  which is again just the front group
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  for the big corporations and now you see that
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  openly where oh you can't say
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  Ivermectin works, doesn't matter
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  if it's a major study, the UN doesn't
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  allow that. They're the boss.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  and when I heard he was inviting
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  a man to combat our racism which is
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  all completely made up, I mean that's
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  the way that they try to disarm American citizens.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  That's right, well we forget that last year
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  he brought in the UN to oversee the southern
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  and northern border and brought him in
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  to help combat racism in America.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  Oh, world government that runs around
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  running slave camps and exploiting third world
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  labor especially Africa and stars people
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  to death, come in and teach us
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  teach us how to not be bad
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  UN. Yeah, yeah, 100% man.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  So I just
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  learned that, that kind of blew my mind.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  I had one more question too
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  that's unrelated. You guys still doing
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  Summerfest because I know you guys have been going through hell lately
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  with all that. We're still doing what?
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  Summerfest
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  Summerfest
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  I know you guys
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  are talking about it. Owen was talking
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  about getting big on it probably
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  beginning of the year before they turned up the heat on you guys.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  No, I never made
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  a big thing out of that.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  Owen I remember vaguely wanted to have a
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  party out at the lake
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  or something back during lockdowns a couple years
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  ago. I'm not against that.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  I'm just not really doing big events
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  just because that's not our strategy.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  They can also try to infiltrate those
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  but I appreciate your call.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  I'm nothing against Owen doing that.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  It's just that
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  I'm not big into the Patriotfest type
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  deals. I'm not against them.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  It's just not what we're doing here.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  We're getting strategic information out to the public
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  talking points to counter the globalist
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  and people to understand their larger narrative and operation.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Lisa
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  in Florida. Lisa, you're on the air.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  Hello.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  Yes, welcome Lisa.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  Hi.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  I wanted to talk about the Reset
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  Wars
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  and also talk about afterwards
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  some of the product plugins.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  Absolutely. Please give us your view.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  The Reset Wars
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  is a great course. I took a similar
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  course a couple of years
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  before COVID started
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  and it was a longer course
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  and it was the same stuff except
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  it was, you know,
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  I wanted to point out that it's really important
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  with this material to
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  repeat it
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  frequently
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  because when you
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  it's about your subconscious mind
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  and how it
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  really imprints
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  in your subconscious
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  and
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  yeah, I mean it's just
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  like
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  everything that happens to you
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  like when something goes in your subconscious mind
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  you don't realize
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  how
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  it's imprinting on your life.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  You know, that is so beautifully said
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  and I didn't go
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  plagiarize this, I didn't go
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  reverse engineer somebody else's course
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  a lot of what you're going to see is going to be out there
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  with other thinkers
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  and folks that are dialed in because it's the truth
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  and then it's also in CIA documents
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  how they're using the same technology
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  but to keep people
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  in this artificial construct
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  and so absolutely
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  look, the things I know in the course
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  I implement 10% of it and it's changed the world
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  I'm trying to be not under their control
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  I'm trying to not be
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  under their construct and just being aware
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  is powerful but it's a process
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  because we're not God, we're not Jesus
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  we're not perfect, in fact we're
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  absolute, you know, fools
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  but being aware of that allows us on the journey
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  to really get out of the globalist
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  control and then help others
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  and so that's why we made Reset Wars
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  it's really powerful info
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  but you get out of it what you put into it
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  and I agree it's something you got to watch
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  you got to take notes, you got to really
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  focus on it to deprogram yourself
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  and then literally God's real
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  will help come in and
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  deprogram you but the Holy Spirit
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  isn't like Satan's spirit
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  that pushes its way in
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  it's very very gentle and it's like
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  gently gently catchy monkey
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  you got to really try to get it into you
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  does that make sense?
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  Yes, I put it in my car
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  I listen to it when I'm in the kitchen
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  it's just really important that
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  when you're in that
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  state of mind when you're in it
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  sort of like the trans-like state
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  it's just beeping in it's sort of like the globalist
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  do when they have you in that
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  trans state when you're watching tv
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  or you're in that sort of
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  state of mind that
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  you know where you're not really
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  or when you're driving your car
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  it's just sort of going in
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  there in a general way and you just keep listening
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  to it and the next thing you know
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  you just feel your life changing
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  and in ways you probably
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  wouldn't imagine it's just
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  sometimes it's like yo-yo dieting like the
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  thermostat in your home where
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  you might
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  it's set and you may not realize where that's
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  set and so you can
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  lose weight but then you gain it back
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  and I hear a lot of people think they
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  don't really know why and it's because
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  you have that imprint in your brain
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  until you change your lifestyle
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  until you get that change
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  in your subconscious mind it will
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  you know keep coming back
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  in a way so you're saying
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  that so well and again just like
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  the advice I give when I'm pointing one finger
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  at you three more back at me this
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  is so real and it's so powerful
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  to get into that
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  expanded consciousness state to open
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  up to God's creation
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  and then it will slowly start
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  blocking out what the globals
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  are doing and then that energy force
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  will push back on you as well I found
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  you know it's not just our independence
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  there's outside bad forces
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  that are going to push in when you try
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  to get rid of it so it's going to be a battle
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  but overall you're going to get stronger in the process

[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  whether they were present that day
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:06.000]  or were otherwise criminally responsible
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  for the assault on our democracy
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  we will follow the facts
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:12.000]  wherever they lead
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:14.000]  domestic terrorists
[1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  the days of independent media are numbered
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:18.000]  the government has made it illegal
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:20.000]  to oppose them
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  they are now deep banking us behind the scenes
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  they want to bankrupt us
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:26.000]  and make us go away quietly
[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:28.000]  with practically half the population
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  the traders
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:34.000]  know they can shut us down by force
[1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  but that would accelerate the awakening
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:38.000]  exponentially
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  so be it
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  make them silence us by force
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  this is the final battle of the information war

[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:52.000]  before everything changes
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  we need you to carry us through to the end
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  victory or death
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:58.000]  go now to infowarstore.com
[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  it was almost 15 years ago
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  that I released my seminal film
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  in-game blueprint for global enslavement
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  then that documentary I predicted
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:10.000]  the globalist would establish
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  a releasing of virus
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  and then triggering a collapse
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  of our industrial society
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  and now they've done it
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  how did I know they would do it because they wrote books
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  and white papers
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  and many of their own reports and internal meetings
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  were leaked
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  you see then I was tracking the Bilderberg group
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  who's head at the time was Klaus Schwab
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  and our sources inside were confirming to us
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  that they were indeed planning to launch
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  this great research
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  and now living in it
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  the purposeful collapse of the third world
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  and the first world
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  now attached to the tyrannical corporate world government
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  the total censorship, no due process
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  destruction of the family
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  and then incrementally more and more deadly injections
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  of poison mass creating these vaccines
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  to poison us in the populace
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:32:58.000]  this is what info wars is fighting
[1:32:58.000 --> 1:33:10.000]  we're fighting for the future
[1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:12.000]  you found it
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:14.000]  the tip of the spear
[1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:16.000]  it is
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:18.000]  the alex joneshow
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  comrade
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:26.000]  joins us
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  I appreciate him coming on on short notice
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  I saw that he was on American Journal
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  with Harrison Smith this morning
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  and he was the first person
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  a long time ago
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  in this last two years
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  he can give you the actual dates to come out and point out
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  project solace
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  not solace or salace solace or however you say it
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:46.000]  the big pentagon
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  AI program
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  that is
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  gathering all the data and is even better than VAERS
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  and shows massive upticks
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  heart attacks, cancers
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  heart swelling you name it
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  and we see similar numbers out of Europe
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  out of Australia, out of New Zealand
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  out of the UK, out of Canada
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  300% increases in
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  heart attacks
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  and 1000% increases in neurological disorders
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  and so much more
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  and some numbers vary, some are worse
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  those are conservative numbers I just put out
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  so he just spoke at
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  the US senator's big event
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  where they were laying
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  all of this out, we played some of the clips
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  a few days ago
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  but there have been some new developments there
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  so I appreciate him coming on
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  to lay this out for us.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  Tom thank you so much
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  please give us the 35,000 foot view on
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  project solace
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  study 5.6 million
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  vaccinated Medicare beneficiaries
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  warning mRNA vaccine effectiveness
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  raises questions
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  mapped Medicare data helps US military
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  deliver pandemic support
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  news articles about this real
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  Pentagon program
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  and now I'm told, because I saw you talking about it
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  that they're doing some damage control
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  and trying to fudge the numbers so tell us what's happening.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  Right
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  so we've got multiple things happening here
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  Alex and it's really easy to get it mixed up
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  so I'm going to try and hit you from a few different directions
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  so project solace
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  is the program that they're using
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  in conjunction
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  with the CDC and that crew
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  to monitor the
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  data danger and injury from all the vaccines.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  Now what we just got
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  and what we were talking about
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  we brought that up and we talked about that
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  and that showed 71% of new cases
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  are in fully vaxxed
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  and 60% of new hospitalizations
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  are in fully vaxxed
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  so yeah that came out
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  about the time that Anthony Fauci
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  was running around telling us all that
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  it's a crisis to the unvaxxed
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  the unvaxxed are
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  you know filling up our hospitals
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  well now
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  we get another set of whistleblowers from the military
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  and they're using a database called
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  DMED and that's the Defense Medical
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  Epidemiology database
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  so this is the premier database
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  in the world
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  for analyzing what's going on with health
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  trends in epidemiology
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  and it focuses on our soldiers
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  so all the data that's in there
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  comes through a system called DMSS
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  which is the Defense Medical Surveillance System
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  and that's the medical records
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  it's electronic medical records
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  for all our soldiers
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  and DMED is there
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  and we pay millions of dollars per year
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  for a whole bunch of people to sit and watch DMED
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  and to watch for injuries
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  and to watch for trends and to make sure
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  that it's good strong solid data
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  and that it's real good
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  so we had some whistleblowers from the military
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  that had the courage and here it is
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  I'm so glad we got these graphs
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  to you
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  this graph that you guys got on the screen
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  right now is from DMED
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  and what you'll see
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  is the years there
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  2016, 2017, 2018
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  2019, 2020
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  and then 2021
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  and what those numbers are
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  is it's the total
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  count of ICD codes
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  for each year
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  ICD codes being the injuries
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  or things that are put into the computer
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  things that are issues with soldiers
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  so on a normal year
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  you have roughly 2 million
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  per year with our soldiers
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  in 2021
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  and I want to point out
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  you see the down tick in 2020
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  not an up tick, the COVID year
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  2020 there's a down tick
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  probably because everybody's locked in their house
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  2021
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  you see a jump
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  by a factor of
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  1000% over average
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  right
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  so what happened, what's different
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  well that's the year the vaccines were given
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  and by the way Tom, you got all the science
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  the same numbers in Europe
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  everywhere showing what these Pentagon numbers are showing
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  but what's incredible is I anecdotally
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  had a bunch of family die
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  I had to do a bunch of people that took the shop that died
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  my dad almost got killed
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  Dr. Malone explains
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  that this created mutations
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  that actually did it but the point is
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  all over the world when they start the injections
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  the illnesses and deaths explode
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  absolutely
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  and this shows
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  that our defense department knew it
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  Fauci and crew knew it
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  and they continue pushing this
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  they continue shoving it out there
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  and continue trying to force
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  our soldiers to be injured and or killed
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  this is sick, this is sick
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  on a level that's mind blowing
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  so we have all this stuff
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  it's all going to be on rem's dash law
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  as soon as I can get it up there
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  we're going to be submitting it to the courts
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  under penalty of perjury
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  the courts are standing behind this data
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  and Alex this is the incredible part
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  right
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  oh by the way this is neurological issues
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  you see the neurological diseases
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  so 80,000, 80,000, 80,000
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  then in 2021
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  we jump up to 863,000
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  right
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  it's over a thousand percent
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  of average or 963%
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  over average
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  it is mind blowing
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  how high this is jumping
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  this is unbelievable
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  these numbers
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  and there's nothing different but the vaccine
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  that's it and it's just like
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  we've seen everywhere in the world
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  so these guys were covering this up and they were hiding it
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  well guess what happened Alex
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  we go and we bake this public
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  and it's blowing up all over the internet
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  so
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  the fact checkers have to come up with something
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  because they're
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  bought and paid for by big pharma
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  so they've got to come up with some sort of
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  excuse somewhere
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  they go to the DOD
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  who have got three different whistleblowers
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  telling me in the last few days
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  how panicked the DOD is over this
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  because the truth is coming out
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  and it shows that they're aware
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  that they're killing our soldiers
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  the DOD comes out and says
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  well
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  we made a mistake for the last five years
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  now let me explain that to you
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  now they could have said
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  well we made a mistake in 2021
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  but that wouldn't have worked well
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  because they want to keep forcing our soldiers
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  to get this and so they know
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  that the new baseline for injuries
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  is going to be way high
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  so now what's going to happen
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  is they had to go back
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  and they're saying
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  that the premier military database
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  you know watching our soldiers health
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  was wrong
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  we pay millions of dollars a year for this database
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  it was wrong for five years
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  and they didn't notice
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  until I blew the whistle with the sitting senator
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  then all of a sudden
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  oh my gosh we found a mistake
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  by the way that mistake
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  was magically remedied
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  at the end of 2020
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  even though they didn't know there was a mistake
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  and fixed in 2021
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  we're supposed to believe that these guys
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  didn't notice this mistake
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  even though we have teams of people
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  whose job it is to watch this
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  we're supposed to believe they didn't notice it
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  until I blew the whistle
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  but even though they hadn't noticed it
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  somehow it magically got fixed
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  we've also seen that graph
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  that we'll have next segment
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  where it shows a hundred countries in the world
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  of John Hopkins' UN numbers
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  that right when the first shot is given
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  illnesses explode
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  and then right when the second shot
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  it goes up even more and then triple shots
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  and then Israel most vaccinated
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  highest rates of hospitalization death
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  and it just goes down the line
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  the more injections the more death and they call it COVID
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  and then they lie and say
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  90 plus percent of people in the hospital
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  are vaccinated you look the numbers up
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  it's not even true it's incredible
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  this demonstrates it all
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  this is the best information out there
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  the best
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  there is no question what's happening
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  and you know the next step is
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  along with submitting this in the courts
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  and everywhere else
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  we're going to be sending this information
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  to the leaders of the
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  house and the senate
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  asking them hey
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  are you guys going to hold these people accountable
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  are you going to do something with this
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  are you going to stand with the soldiers
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  and the American people
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  or are you going to continue to be bought out
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  by special interest big pharma
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  in the billionaire crowd
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  now we've got all sorts of information
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  and I plan on asking
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  our house and senate leadership
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  hey how much stock
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  do you have in big pharma
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  how much do you own
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  by the way how many
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  your mutual funds black rock all these guys
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  how much do they own because
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  having a straw man on it for you doesn't make it any better
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  so I want to know
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  how much money these guys are making off of it
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  now I'm telling you I'm going to ask
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  it's coming I'm going to be asking this
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  so my advice to you elected officials
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  sell your stock
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  and get on board here because
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  it's time for you guys to come clean
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  absolutely this house of cards
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  is coming down I don't just say that
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  to be positive and hope that it really is
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  I wonder what the hell they're thinking
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  even Melinda Gates is running away right now
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  stay with us
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  I'm a master on the
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  natural chemicals found in the hips
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  may even be helpful for a variety of health
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  conditions including those with
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  osteoarthritis and for those with pain
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  after surgery studies have shown
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  as for vitamin c and zinc themselves
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  you probably already know that they play
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  an important role in nutrition
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  immune defense and the maintenance
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  of your everyday health
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  it has been reported that intake
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  of both is often inadequate
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:53.920]  populations like here in America. So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at
[1:43:53.920 --> 1:44:22.640]  the website www.infoorstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[1:44:22.640 --> 1:44:28.400]  You're a programmer for collapsing us of build back better. This is nothing more than
[1:44:28.400 --> 1:44:34.480]  a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy. Because they couldn't take our guns
[1:44:34.480 --> 1:44:39.080]  because we wouldn't bow. Because the left, which is the ideology of this world government
[1:44:39.080 --> 1:44:46.240]  system, couldn't win. They released a biological weapon on us. Now we know two years ago, we
[1:44:46.240 --> 1:44:50.360]  learned about it about 20 months ago. It's that simple. They can't be because of our
[1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:55.240]  free speech and our guns. So the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the
[1:44:55.240 --> 1:44:57.840]  rest of history. Expose this paradigm and we win.
[1:44:57.840 --> 1:45:06.600]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome. Go ahead. Hey, how's it going, Alex? Good, bro. Great last caller.
[1:45:06.600 --> 1:45:10.680]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement. It's basically the only
[1:45:10.680 --> 1:45:15.840]  way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity. It's like we're
[1:45:15.840 --> 1:45:20.600]  living in a twilight zone, man. All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling.
[1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:23.480]  Go ahead. Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick
[1:45:23.480 --> 1:45:27.680]  plug out for one of the product. The X2 group does wonders. They recommend it to everybody.
[1:45:27.680 --> 1:45:31.920]  You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the info ward.

[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:23.360]  they could shut you down. Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting

[1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:06.240]  Seeing a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:06.240 --> 1:47:24.240]  You can see the statistics. You can watch people around you die or take a shot. You
[1:47:24.240 --> 1:47:30.640]  got a U.S. Senator, Democrat. Got the arsenal right here. Took the shot. Had a massive stroke
[1:47:30.640 --> 1:47:35.960]  fighting for his life. And here's some of the numbers from John Hopkins and U.N. numbers.
[1:47:35.960 --> 1:47:40.160]  All over the world, this is already eight months old. Everywhere, after you take the
[1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:45.320]  shot and then they have the boosters, it just explodes. Hospitalizations, deaths, you name
[1:47:45.320 --> 1:47:52.120]  it. Tom Renz is one of the most important lawyers out there fighting this tyranny and
[1:47:52.120 --> 1:47:58.120]  just doing a great job breaking this down to members of the Senate and the House. He's
[1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:02.480]  important committee meetings. And we just cannot thank him enough for what he's doing.
[1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:07.840]  And he's not BSing you. He's going off the facts that the House of Cards is coming down
[1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:11.760]  very, very quickly. Two weeks ago, we had the head of the U.N. vaccine program say,
[1:48:11.760 --> 1:48:16.520]  don't give it to children. And it can cause heart attacks. So they're all trying to cover
[1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:20.640]  their ass right now, aren't they? Quietly coming on, okay, we're going to put on the
[1:48:20.640 --> 1:48:24.440]  insert that was blank before I can kill you. Hey, don't give it to kids. But then the big
[1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:30.960]  companies and the corporate media that's bought off, they just keep pushing saying, it's wonderful.
[1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:35.600]  There's no side effects. It works perfectly. It totally protects you, destroying all of
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:40.040]  their credibility. How are they going to extricate themselves from this? And what do you predicts
[1:48:40.040 --> 1:48:41.040]  coming next?
[1:48:41.040 --> 1:48:46.880]  Well, I got to tell you, Alex, so I don't think there's a good, I don't think they have
[1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:52.440]  an exit plan. That's part of the reason there's so much panic. They were hoping this would
[1:48:52.440 --> 1:49:00.800]  quietly go away. But now with this, I mean, we're going after justice, right? I'm a justice
[1:49:00.800 --> 1:49:07.080]  guy. Let me tell you what they're doing. So you saw right before the break, your guys
[1:49:07.080 --> 1:49:12.000]  showed a couple of those graphs and you saw things that looked like the same graph, but
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:17.040]  the numbers were different. Well, that's because once we went public with this, and they said
[1:49:17.040 --> 1:49:21.800]  that, oh, we just made that mistake, they went in and started doctoring the database
[1:49:21.800 --> 1:49:27.080]  and changing all the numbers. And they're trying to argue that for five years in this
[1:49:27.080 --> 1:49:34.040]  premier database, they were off by a thousand plus percent in some cases, a thousand. So
[1:49:34.040 --> 1:49:39.200]  I mean, listen, this isn't like we made an oops, they're claiming that the premier database
[1:49:39.200 --> 1:49:43.800]  in the world that we spend millions of dollars on was off by a thousand plus percent. It's
[1:49:43.800 --> 1:49:45.800]  incredible and it's just stupid.
[1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:50.480]  Well, they're trying to cover their tracks, but everybody knows, I've talked to so many
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:55.520]  veterans in current military that have been more made to take it, it's wrecked their lives.
[1:49:55.520 --> 1:50:01.280]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, and listen, I mean, it's no, it's no wonder, right? For these
[1:50:01.280 --> 1:50:05.480]  guys, they're going to say, well, you know, it's better for us to show it as a glitch
[1:50:05.480 --> 1:50:10.080]  or being a little bit off. And, you know, maybe we wasted some money, but that's better
[1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:15.960]  than us going to jail for killing our soldiers. I mean, listen, Alex, if I point a gun at
[1:50:15.960 --> 1:50:22.120]  you and I shoot you in the shoulder and you die, and, and I say, well, I wasn't trying
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:28.680]  to murder you, I shot you in the shoulder. I'm still guilty of murder, right? If I, if
[1:50:28.680 --> 1:50:35.000]  I do something that with reckless indifference towards your life and you die, that's murder.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:41.120]  If these guys know, which they do, that these shots have a high and a real likelihood of
[1:50:41.120 --> 1:50:47.320]  injury or death, they cover it up and force people to get it. What is that? What is that?
[1:50:47.320 --> 1:50:52.000]  What has Anthony Fauci done? What are they doing to our soldiers? And, you know, their
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:58.560]  fear is, is what's going to happen because, you know, realistically, as the American people
[1:50:58.560 --> 1:51:04.880]  wake up, they're going to demand justice. And what's justice going to be? I mean, you know,
[1:51:04.880 --> 1:51:09.760]  everybody talks about Nuremberg 2.0. I don't know what else we could have. This is a global
[1:51:09.760 --> 1:51:10.960]  attack on humanity.
[1:51:10.960 --> 1:51:16.880]  I agree. Let me add this. All the political facts and people said it's a lie that maths
[1:51:16.880 --> 1:51:21.160]  don't work. Now it's proven it's a lie. They're the ones lying. They have, they're all doubling
[1:51:21.160 --> 1:51:25.480]  down defending and trying to cover this up, but it's not just the Pentagon AI database
[1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:28.920]  or the other Pentagon database you just mentioned. I've looked at the documents you're dead on.
[1:51:28.920 --> 1:51:32.720]  Obviously, you're the one that put them out and got it from whistleblowers. Great job.
[1:51:32.720 --> 1:51:38.520]  But it mirrors the numbers out of Europe and the UK and New Zealand and Australia and Canada.
[1:51:38.520 --> 1:51:43.240]  They're getting similar. Thousand percent neurological increases, 300, 400, 500 percent
[1:51:43.240 --> 1:51:48.400]  heart attack, microcarditis, 1,000, 3,000 percent increases in blood clots. And that's
[1:51:48.400 --> 1:51:54.400]  just who they're, 64 percent in multiple studies getting with D-dimer tests that they're having
[1:51:54.400 --> 1:52:00.440]  blood clots after. I mean, this is real. I've got four or five articles of people collapsing
[1:52:00.440 --> 1:52:06.800]  on the heart attacks after the shots in sports just today. We can't even cover it all.
[1:52:06.800 --> 1:52:11.440]  Oh, well, and Alex, I'm going to tell you one of the real secrets that nobody's talking
[1:52:11.440 --> 1:52:16.240]  about is that we've got, remember, we've been talking about whistleblower data for months.
[1:52:16.240 --> 1:52:19.720]  We've had lots of whistleblowers both on, now we've got in the military side and this
[1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:24.840]  date is incredible. It's next level. These guys are heroes. I mean, absolute heroes.
[1:52:24.840 --> 1:52:29.600]  By the way, I want to make a public statement. If you screw with my whistleblowers, if you
[1:52:29.600 --> 1:52:34.440]  corrupt monsters, screw with my whistleblowers. I will see you in court. I don't care who you
[1:52:34.440 --> 1:52:39.920]  are or what you're doing. You screw with them. I got their back and I got a whole team of
[1:52:39.920 --> 1:52:45.600]  attorneys now that have this data. We have backup on backup on backup. It doesn't matter
[1:52:45.600 --> 1:52:51.600]  what you do. We will protect these whistleblowers. These are American heroes. So, you know, you're
[1:52:51.600 --> 1:52:58.120]  right though. Everywhere we look, there's more and more evidence in everything we see.
[1:52:58.120 --> 1:53:04.480]  How many times do these guys have to keep lying and lying and lying before people wake
[1:53:04.480 --> 1:53:13.440]  up? Here's the thing. You look at my guys, Peter McCullough, Robert Malone, Cole, all
[1:53:13.440 --> 1:53:17.320]  these guys. These guys are heroes. They're out there fighting. But look what's happened.
[1:53:17.320 --> 1:53:22.840]  There are reputations attacked. They're maligned in the media. They're not only not making
[1:53:22.840 --> 1:53:26.400]  money, they're losing money. None of us are making money on this.
[1:53:26.400 --> 1:53:29.720]  We're all being targeted and attacked. Dr. Peter McCullough, by the way, is going to
[1:53:29.720 --> 1:53:33.880]  be in studio tomorrow to respond to the lies about his Joe Rogan interview by the corporate
[1:53:33.880 --> 1:53:38.680]  media and go point by point tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central. He'll be with us for two hours at
[1:53:38.680 --> 1:53:41.800]  the start of the show if he can get here with all the ice and the rest of it. But he says
[1:53:41.800 --> 1:53:48.160]  he's still coming down. But let's talk about that. Again, we know they're trying to suppress
[1:53:48.160 --> 1:53:51.960]  the truth about this and trying to suppress the illnesses and the problems, but it's coming
[1:53:51.960 --> 1:53:56.560]  out everywhere. So as you said, they don't have an exit plan. You're a smart guy. You
[1:53:56.560 --> 1:54:01.120]  predicted a lot of this. What would unfold? What do you see happening next then?
[1:54:01.120 --> 1:54:07.040]  Well, you know, right now, my next step is to ask our elected officials where they're
[1:54:07.040 --> 1:54:11.440]  going to stand. And, you know, they're either going to stand with the crop beer cats, the
[1:54:11.440 --> 1:54:15.200]  billionaire crowd and the drug company and special interests, or they're going to stand
[1:54:15.200 --> 1:54:20.120]  with the American people in this election year. And, you know, I want to know that answer.
[1:54:20.120 --> 1:54:26.000]  Once we see that answer, it'll be interesting. I wouldn't be surprised to see these people
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:30.760]  thrown under the bus because that's where they belong. Now, the question is, how many
[1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:35.280]  people can we make accountable and how far can we get with justice? My intent is to bring
[1:54:35.280 --> 1:54:41.160]  as many bad guys down as I can. But we will be pushing for accountability and justice
[1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:47.080]  in this. And I'm going to tell you, there's nothing they can do. We've got this data in
[1:54:47.080 --> 1:54:54.160]  so many places and with so many people, they can't stop this. And Alex, here's me telling
[1:54:54.160 --> 1:54:59.640]  your viewers, guys, if you're not trying to get more people to watch Alex's show, you're
[1:54:59.640 --> 1:55:04.400]  not doing your job. Everybody says, what can I do to help? Well, you can share this information
[1:55:04.400 --> 1:55:08.880]  and get it out there. Okay. You know, for me, you can pray, you can go to Rensdash Law.
[1:55:08.880 --> 1:55:13.160]  We've got to give Sengo. I need some help there, please. You know, but you can share
[1:55:13.160 --> 1:55:19.160]  Alex Jones' show. Alex has been talking about this, but for people like Alex, but for the
[1:55:19.160 --> 1:55:24.720]  alternative media that tells the truth, none of this is out there. Alex, you're a damn
[1:55:24.720 --> 1:55:30.440]  hero in this country for being willing to have the courage to speak up. So, you know,
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:35.920]  one of the next steps is to make sure every American in this country hears this, is aware
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:41.240]  of it, and it's time to wake up. You know, Klaus Schwab wants the great reset. I agree.
[1:55:41.240 --> 1:55:46.120]  We need a great reset. But the great reset we need is one that takes us back to freedom,
[1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:50.920]  takes us back to our Constitution, wakes people up, makes them realize that they have to stand
[1:55:50.920 --> 1:55:55.800]  for our nation, stand for our country, and standing for freedom means fighting for freedom.
[1:55:55.800 --> 1:55:59.760]  You don't roll over when someone tells you you got to wear a mask. You don't roll over
[1:55:59.760 --> 1:56:03.760]  when they lock you in your house for 14 days, and you sure as hell don't roll over when
[1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:07.560]  they say we're going to inject an experimental jab into your children so you can watch them
[1:56:07.560 --> 1:56:09.640]  die over the next 20 years.
[1:56:09.640 --> 1:56:13.720]  Beautifully said. Do five more minutes with us, my friend, ahead of this NBA player who's
[1:56:13.720 --> 1:56:20.880]  fighting all of this, joining us as well. But Tom Renz is our guest, R-E-N-Z-Law, RenzLaw.com.
[1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:25.800]  He's out there, probably the most prominent lawyer, getting stuff done, filing suits,
[1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:29.280]  getting in front of legislatures, getting in front of committees, just kicking ass. He's
[1:56:29.280 --> 1:56:34.680]  all over the place, and like Superman. And it's true. I mean, he's saying I'm a hero.
[1:56:34.680 --> 1:56:38.440]  Look, look, we're all just trying to survive here. We're smart enough to know we're under
[1:56:38.440 --> 1:56:43.280]  attack, scientific covert attack, a new type of warfare by the corporations that got mad
[1:56:43.280 --> 1:56:48.000]  at Trump and populism, and they launched all this to try to take over. And I think like
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:52.200]  most tyrants in history that over calculate and overplay their hand, this is going to
[1:56:52.200 --> 1:56:59.280]  bring them down. But I cannot express enough what he just said. This is a damn war. Yeah,
[1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:03.280]  we got lots of videos that get a million views every day. That ain't enough, folks. We need
[1:57:03.280 --> 1:57:07.280]  to reach everybody. So I'm not mad at you. I'm saying we're in this together. If we're
[1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:11.640]  going to get out of this, you got to get aggressive with the band video videos. And they try to
[1:57:11.640 --> 1:57:15.640]  block you sharing that link. So it's future news dot news. And you got to get it out on
[1:57:15.640 --> 1:57:19.840]  your email list, your text message by hand, take clips of it, put it up everywhere else.
[1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:27.440]  This is a information war. Their whole attack is about blocking us about blocking you. They
[1:57:27.440 --> 1:57:33.160]  will not succeed if the signal gets out. And out of all the amazing signals, info wars
[1:57:33.160 --> 1:57:37.800]  is right there at the tip of the spear. We have this giant audience of you. Freedom is
[1:57:37.800 --> 1:57:42.400]  powered by you. You're the reason info wars are so powerful. We'll be right back. Stay

[1:59:50.040 --> 1:59:57.040]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:59:57.040 --> 2:00:08.040]  If you're going to have a covert kill system, you want to be able to give a bunch of people
[2:00:08.040 --> 2:00:16.640]  saltwater, placebo and then others the toxic injection. That's what I've seen. I've talked
[2:00:16.640 --> 2:00:22.600]  to military people at the grocery store and gas stations and basically all the military
[2:00:22.600 --> 2:00:26.560]  that's active that we've had in here. We had a green beret doctor in here a few weeks ago.
[2:00:26.560 --> 2:00:30.200]  He said, my God, he goes, I've had hundreds of shots over the years. He's 50 something
[2:00:30.200 --> 2:00:35.160]  years old was in the military in the 80s. And he says, I have brain fog now. I've never
[2:00:35.160 --> 2:00:39.320]  been this sick after they gave me the two shots. And he goes, I probably can't we saw
[2:00:39.320 --> 2:00:43.120]  him on air. He sat right here and talked about it. He was here with his cool dog because
[2:00:43.120 --> 2:00:48.080]  he's working in the task force down on the border for the governor. And so there he was.
[2:00:48.080 --> 2:00:52.120]  And then we have the Greg Reese report showing out of these databases. I want to see what
[2:00:52.120 --> 2:00:57.400]  our ginks of this that certain areas are being targeted with the more toxic lots of this.
[2:00:57.400 --> 2:01:01.280]  Tom Renz, Renz, you're right at the tip of the spear on this. What do you think is going
[2:01:01.280 --> 2:01:05.960]  on here? Well, it's an experiment in my opinion. Okay.
[2:01:05.960 --> 2:01:11.680]  So I've got a lot of evidence on this. And so I don't mind talking about it. You know,
[2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:17.000]  I don't like talking about unless I can show it. But the evidence I've seen is very, very
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:22.280]  strong in my opinion that different lots are different formulations. Now, whether they're
[2:01:22.280 --> 2:01:26.600]  different ingredients or not, I don't know for sure, because naturally everything is
[2:01:26.600 --> 2:01:34.040]  super secret. But we're seeing massive increases in side effects in some lots versus others.
[2:01:34.040 --> 2:01:38.240]  And the analysis that's been done on this, I got a few really, really brilliant scientists
[2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:44.960]  that have analyzed the heck out of this. And it really strongly indicates that this is
[2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:49.760]  what we all know it is one giant experiment. Now, I'm going to tell you, Alex, so some
[2:01:49.760 --> 2:01:54.280]  of this stuff, you know, we're not arguing in court, but I again, I've seen enough evidence
[2:01:54.280 --> 2:02:02.280]  that I'm comfortable talking about it. What we see is the money in this is not going towards
[2:02:02.280 --> 2:02:07.240]  the COVID shots. So right now, if they could, they I think they would let the COVID shots
[2:02:07.240 --> 2:02:10.960]  go away and then just put the money in the gene therapy, which they're already moving
[2:02:10.960 --> 2:02:16.040]  into the flu shots, right? The money is in the gene therapy, that's where the investment
[2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:20.680]  money is, that's where the global investment is, that's where all that's going. So gene
[2:02:20.680 --> 2:02:24.560]  therapy, if you look historically, there's been a lot of talk about this, they've been
[2:02:24.560 --> 2:02:28.720]  trying to get it handled and get it to become mainstream for a long time, but no one would
[2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:34.960]  take it. So now with this whole COVID nonsense, they've they've forced people to take these
[2:02:34.960 --> 2:02:39.240]  gene therapies. By the way, I've got Pfizer and Moderna documents openly admitting that
[2:02:39.240 --> 2:02:42.960]  these are gene therapies. So I don't need to get into that. It's from Pfizer, it's from
[2:02:42.960 --> 2:02:48.760]  Moderna, they admit it. It's not disputable, right? So what do you do when you put out
[2:02:48.760 --> 2:02:53.000]  something new that's untested? Well, you got to test it. So they've got to me, it looks
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:58.560]  like they've got different different formulations that are going to different places. And I
[2:02:58.560 --> 2:03:05.680]  think that they they're literally testing out to try and figure out how to best create
[2:03:05.680 --> 2:03:13.440]  and develop this gene therapy stuff. Now, we've got evidence that I would say is credible
[2:03:13.440 --> 2:03:18.360]  of a lot of other things, but it's, it's, it gets out there far enough that I don't
[2:03:18.360 --> 2:03:22.600]  feel comfortable talking about it publicly. And I spend all day researching this as well,
[2:03:22.600 --> 2:03:26.680]  but you're a lawyer, you've got the documents. They, as you said before, they were did this
[2:03:26.680 --> 2:03:30.520]  admitted they were going to do gene therapy. And now they say, Oh, make flu shots and make
[2:03:30.520 --> 2:03:35.320]  other shots mandatory gene therapy. And they even said in 2019, right before this was launched
[2:03:35.320 --> 2:03:41.800]  on C-SPAN with Fauci, we need a new virus out of China to blow up the old system and
[2:03:41.800 --> 2:03:45.720]  make people accept gene therapy. So you're right, this is all about their revolution
[2:03:45.720 --> 2:03:51.600]  of gene therapy. Yeah, yeah, they've been very clear about that. I mean, this is really
[2:03:51.600 --> 2:03:55.040]  the money is pushing the gene therapy. And you got to understand that the money and the
[2:03:55.040 --> 2:04:01.120]  power is pushing genetic therapy. Now, why is that so important? That I can't prove.
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:05.120]  But what I can tell you is that's where it's going. That's what they're pushing for. And
[2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:09.760]  you know, they've already tried to integrate this into the flu shot. So if you're getting
[2:04:09.760 --> 2:04:14.360]  the flu shot, I think next year, I don't know if it's in this year or not, there'll be gene
[2:04:14.360 --> 2:04:19.320]  therapy in it. So, you know, they're going to try and quietly have the COVID vaccines,
[2:04:19.320 --> 2:04:22.640]  you know, maybe we get justice, maybe they don't. But what they're going to try and hold
[2:04:22.640 --> 2:04:29.280]  on to is the gene therapy. So just FYI, guys, we'll be suing over that too. You know, we
[2:04:29.280 --> 2:04:33.280]  do know what they're doing. We're going to fight them every step of the way. That's
[2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:38.000]  why we need your support. So please do support us at Rensdashlaw.com and I'll give you some

[2:06:23.680 --> 2:06:29.360]  There is a fight against humanity happening around the world. And do you want to be on
[2:06:29.360 --> 2:06:33.800]  the side of the eugenicists, the death cult, the Nazis 2.0, or do you want to be on the
[2:06:33.800 --> 2:06:41.680]  side of humanity? A couple weeks ago, the co-owner of the NBA's Warriors, we played the clip like
[2:06:41.680 --> 2:06:45.280]  five times. We'll play it again coming up next segment. He said, I don't care about
[2:06:45.280 --> 2:06:49.400]  these three million people in death camps being used as slave labor. I don't care about
[2:06:49.400 --> 2:06:55.720]  that. They don't even rise to my beautiful mind. Remember when Herbert Walker Bush's
[2:06:55.720 --> 2:07:00.080]  wife said, I don't even care about those dead Iraqis. They don't even rise to my beautiful
[2:07:00.080 --> 2:07:07.760]  mind. Well, he made the same sick psychotic statement of no empathy. And then at the time,
[2:07:07.760 --> 2:07:13.420]  I said, can you please get Royce White on, because he was out there eloquently speaking
[2:07:13.420 --> 2:07:19.760]  out against this, and even being attacked some places. Like, how dare you not want slave
[2:07:19.760 --> 2:07:25.600]  camps in China? So he's an author. He's got, you know, an amazing background to go over
[2:07:25.600 --> 2:07:30.800]  his whole bio. It would take a long time. Been a big successful person in the NBA and
[2:07:30.800 --> 2:07:36.120]  now is doing mixed martial arts as well. He's born and raised in Twin Cities, Minnesota.
[2:07:36.120 --> 2:07:39.000]  He's currently a professional athlete, former NBA player and a professional mixed martial
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:42.160]  arts. He's the author and political activist, and he's been outspoken on issues such as
[2:07:42.160 --> 2:07:49.040]  mental health, the Uighurs, the CCP, Corporateocracy, the Federal Reserve, Gain of Function and
[2:07:49.040 --> 2:07:55.280]  others, RoyceWhite.Substack.com. Thank you so much for joining us. Really look forward
[2:07:55.280 --> 2:07:58.240]  the next 50 minutes with you, my friend. We can go wherever you want.
[2:07:58.240 --> 2:08:02.520]  Man, it's an honor to be here. And I want to say thank you for all the work you've
[2:08:02.520 --> 2:08:08.960]  been doing. And honestly, man, it's an absolute honor. I appreciate the time. And first, we'll
[2:08:08.960 --> 2:08:12.200]  get to Chalmeth in a second. And I'm glad we got a little bit of time because I want
[2:08:12.200 --> 2:08:16.560]  to be able to flush this out a little bit from the ground up of where I'm coming from
[2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:22.280]  on this issue and many of these issues. I know a lot about you, obviously, but many
[2:08:22.280 --> 2:08:26.720]  people in your audience and you probably don't know very much about me. And that's a deliberate
[2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:34.120]  effort on behalf of the establishment. So I first arrived in the public eye as an all-American
[2:08:34.120 --> 2:08:41.800]  athlete, playing basketball. And I first entered into the public discourse when I was drafted
[2:08:41.800 --> 2:08:46.880]  into the NBA and had a huge controversy with them about mental health and mental health
[2:08:46.880 --> 2:08:53.200]  policy, which was non-existent at the time. And since then, they have attempted to sort
[2:08:53.200 --> 2:08:58.120]  of half-heartedly implement a lot of the suggestions that I made around mental health and mental
[2:08:58.120 --> 2:09:07.240]  health policy and culture and attitude and so on and so forth. And at the time, I didn't
[2:09:07.240 --> 2:09:12.400]  really want to have a conversation about mental health in terms of how much treatment, adequate
[2:09:12.400 --> 2:09:17.760]  treatment the players were getting, although that was lacking and it was in need of some
[2:09:17.760 --> 2:09:23.680]  type of addressing in the NBA ecosystem. But that wasn't the central theme of what I was
[2:09:23.680 --> 2:09:29.400]  trying to convey, although the mainstream media took what I was doing advocating for
[2:09:29.400 --> 2:09:33.920]  and kind of morphed it as you've seen and as we've all seen the mainstream media do.
[2:09:33.920 --> 2:09:39.520]  And so what I was trying to convey was something more like mental health is the greatest social
[2:09:39.520 --> 2:09:45.920]  issue we face. And there's an epidemic of mental illness that is fast on the rise and
[2:09:45.920 --> 2:09:54.080]  going to explode in the years to come. And also I was trying to say the NBA represents
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:59.120]  a global corporate community. Professional sports represents a global corporate community.
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:07.000]  It's the watering hole for a global corporate community. And mental health is a way to say
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:12.240]  the human condition where mind, body, and spirit converge into our perceivable existence.
[2:10:12.240 --> 2:10:19.200]  So how the corporate world feels about the human condition is a great indicator of the
[2:10:19.200 --> 2:10:24.920]  overall health of our society, right? And I was black ball for that, right? And ever
[2:10:24.920 --> 2:10:29.280]  since I've been fighting the establishment. And I guess back then I had this arrogant
[2:10:29.280 --> 2:10:34.560]  and naive belief that the troubles I was having and trying to discuss mental health policy
[2:10:34.560 --> 2:10:38.960]  with the NBA came from some lack of knowledge on their end. There were all these doctors
[2:10:38.960 --> 2:10:43.200]  and people around in this conversation behind the scenes that were really perplexed at the
[2:10:43.200 --> 2:10:48.080]  NBA's resistance towards a mental health policy because mental health wasn't full blown
[2:10:48.080 --> 2:10:50.400]  in the mainstream yet, but it was on the move.
[2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:54.000]  By the way, I totally agree with you that the number one issue is mental health. We can
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:59.600]  all see it in our lives. I mean, everybody's disintegrating. I mean, we are in trouble.
[2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:04.840]  Absolutely. And so, and what I realized in retrospect, this was about five years after
[2:11:04.840 --> 2:11:10.440]  this initial scuffle between me and the NBA and around policy. And again, I arrogantly
[2:11:10.440 --> 2:11:14.120]  as a 21 year old, I'm sitting there thinking, you know, maybe there's something I can communicate
[2:11:14.120 --> 2:11:18.240]  to them that they're just not getting that this is the greatest issue of our time and
[2:11:18.240 --> 2:11:23.240]  this a conversation that needed to be had. But five or six years later around when big
[2:11:23.240 --> 2:11:30.600]  tech started to admit that their growth model was to go after the psychological vulnerability
[2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:38.120]  of common people, it all clicked for me that of course the NBA didn't want to have a role
[2:11:38.120 --> 2:11:43.400]  in spearheading a genuine mental health conversation because the entire growth model of this global
[2:11:43.400 --> 2:11:49.920]  corporatocracy was predicated around them exploiting the vulnerabilities in the human
[2:11:49.920 --> 2:11:56.680]  psychology and an information warfare. And here I am today, happy to be on info wars
[2:11:56.680 --> 2:12:00.560]  and I've watched you a lot and I know you've talked about that a lot. And as I went through
[2:12:00.560 --> 2:12:04.320]  that, I started to look out at people who the establishment and the corporatocracy had
[2:12:04.320 --> 2:12:09.080]  tried to silence, whether it be you, whether it be Minister Lewis fair con, whether it
[2:12:09.080 --> 2:12:16.040]  be a guy now like Robert Malone or Steve Bannon or, you know, Peter McCullough or whoever
[2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:19.480]  these absolutely if you go look at who they're shutting down and trying to put in prison,
[2:12:19.480 --> 2:12:23.800]  that's the truth tellers. Those are all the truth tellers. And I was kind of on that
[2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:29.000]  initial wave, although my story never really took that, you know, got a lot of traction
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:32.200]  like a lot of people will say, well, you were the collar Kaepernick before the collar
[2:12:32.200 --> 2:12:36.960]  Kaepernick is like, well, not really because the issue I was talking about wasn't didn't
[2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:41.040]  come with all of the conflation like racism, it was more straight down the middle and they
[2:12:41.040 --> 2:12:47.240]  had plans to exploit this more more directly. So yeah, that's kind of the background story
[2:12:47.240 --> 2:12:52.240]  and exactly Kaepernick's a rabbit hole or rabbit trail. You're going right at the issue.
[2:12:52.240 --> 2:12:57.000]  Hey, we're falling apart. And then you learn as I learned to Facebook documents come out
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:00.160]  where they want to make you depressed. They want to control you. They want to make you
[2:13:00.160 --> 2:13:03.320]  alone. And they're hitting everybody. They don't care what color you are. They're coming
[2:13:03.320 --> 2:13:08.560]  after everybody's children. Absolutely. I mean, you think of the growth
[2:13:08.560 --> 2:13:12.320]  model and you know, you saw a guy like Chometh who now says, well, we don't care about the
[2:13:12.320 --> 2:13:17.440]  Uighurs. He's the same guy that was in the clip during the I forgot what the documentary
[2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:24.080]  was, but it was basically the social media whistleblowers and controlled opposition documentary.
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:28.920]  And he came right out and said, listen, we went after the dopamine. So instead of now,
[2:13:28.920 --> 2:13:33.440]  and I say now that, you know, a lot of people are concerned about the cartels in South America
[2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:38.120]  and the crisis on our Texas border. And I agree that we have one. I believe in the nation
[2:13:38.120 --> 2:13:42.520]  state. I believe in borders, but make no mistake about it. The biggest drug dealers are in
[2:13:42.520 --> 2:13:48.600]  Silicon Valley and the biggest drug is produced inside your mind already with the dopamine,
[2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:54.320]  you know, sensors and transport. So, you know, this was all by design. And we are now in
[2:13:54.320 --> 2:14:00.800]  a full blown mental health crisis. And you can see it with liberalism, of course, but
[2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:04.720]  you can see it across the political spectrum as well, whether it be self doubt, you know,
[2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:09.800]  being timid, being fearful, being faithless, all of these things are what Robert Malone
[2:14:09.800 --> 2:14:16.960]  called, you know, mass form psychosis. So it was, it's really profound for me to be
[2:14:16.960 --> 2:14:20.840]  able to look back at my own story and say, man, I entered into this public conversation
[2:14:20.840 --> 2:14:24.320]  talking about mental health and now we're in a full blown mental health crisis.
[2:14:24.320 --> 2:14:28.080]  Well, that's right. So you instinctively saw the problem and then tried to help and
[2:14:28.080 --> 2:14:31.560]  then when they oppose you, say they happen to me, then you learned who they were and
[2:14:31.560 --> 2:14:35.360]  what they were doing by trying to do good and then being blocked by them and then and
[2:14:35.360 --> 2:14:38.280]  then and then understanding the bigger picture. Is that what you're saying?
[2:14:38.280 --> 2:14:46.240]  100%. And even more so, I think there's a, you know, I think a lot of people miss how
[2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:54.400]  evil spiritness coalesces and the intuition of people who are working on behalf of evil
[2:14:54.400 --> 2:15:01.320]  forces, right? It's, did David Stern and the Wall Street crew and DC and Hollywood and
[2:15:01.320 --> 2:15:06.480]  all of these different institutions know exactly or the central banks? There's another example.
[2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:13.760]  Did they know exactly how Facebook and the whole big tech movement plan to roll out?
[2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:18.960]  Maybe not directly, maybe not every individual, but there is a tilt and an intuition toward
[2:15:18.960 --> 2:15:24.000]  evil spiritness. And in that, they saw fit to black ball a young man like myself who
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:30.320]  had the talent and skill to play at the highest level in order to preserve the, the, the, the
[2:15:30.320 --> 2:15:32.720]  effort that they had planned in the future.
[2:15:32.720 --> 2:15:36.280]  And that's why I've been familiar with your work for years and I was already impressed
[2:15:36.280 --> 2:15:39.120]  with you, but I'm really impressed. Now, one of their trying to, like you said, black
[2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:43.080]  ball you and keep you out. You're awesome. You're dead on and we're going to learn a
[2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:48.200]  lot from you here today about all of this because we are in a war and if we're aware
[2:15:48.200 --> 2:15:51.560]  of the war, we can beat it. If we're not aware, we're going to lose. We're going to come back
[2:15:51.560 --> 2:15:55.560]  and talk about this war for the mind of the soul and this evil spirit of this when we
[2:15:55.560 --> 2:16:02.760]  come back with all the craziness going on in the world with the globalist plotting their
[2:16:02.760 --> 2:16:08.400]  next big lockdown for the next phase of the great reset being a stage cyber attack with
[2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:14.960]  the deep state pushing a civil war, not just here, but in Europe and war with Russia with
[2:16:14.960 --> 2:16:20.040]  the massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place like supply chain right
[2:16:20.040 --> 2:16:27.120]  now. You need to get prepared now with high quality, storeable food that is ready to ship.
[2:16:27.120 --> 2:16:32.120]  And it's been four years since my Patriot supply at preparewithalix.com has offered
[2:16:32.120 --> 2:16:40.120]  their storeable food at 25% off four years. But right now it's 25% off until February
[2:16:40.120 --> 2:16:48.320]  13th, 2022, a little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at preparewithalix.com
[2:16:48.320 --> 2:16:54.680]  on the entire catalog of my Patriot supply act now, get prepared now. This is absolutely
[2:16:54.680 --> 2:16:59.880]  essential for everybody that wants to be self sufficient. So when I first started taking
[2:16:59.880 --> 2:17:05.080]  survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had brain fog like you wouldn't
[2:17:05.080 --> 2:17:09.800]  believe I was barely holding on to a job. And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened
[2:17:09.800 --> 2:17:14.160]  to it. So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1. And it worked pretty
[2:17:14.160 --> 2:17:17.840]  good. And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that. You had, you know, with a deep
[2:17:17.840 --> 2:17:21.240]  burden source, you know, and I got really excited about that. So I took it. And man,
[2:17:21.240 --> 2:17:27.120]  in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you
[2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:31.840]  know, I could think again, I could connect with people again. And over the course of
[2:17:31.840 --> 2:17:35.840]  the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all
[2:17:35.840 --> 2:17:40.120]  of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently
[2:17:40.120 --> 2:17:44.520]  is knock out literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works.
[2:17:44.520 --> 2:17:48.480]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. That's a break free of the
[2:17:48.480 --> 2:17:53.080]  globalist system. And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand.
[2:17:53.080 --> 2:17:59.760]  You beautifully said, brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed. Whether
[2:17:59.760 --> 2:18:04.760]  they were present that day, or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our
[2:18:04.760 --> 2:18:14.720]  democracy, we will follow the facts wherever they lead. The days of independent media are
[2:18:14.720 --> 2:18:20.040]  numbered. The government has made it illegal to oppose them. They are now deep banking us
[2:18:20.040 --> 2:18:25.920]  behind the scenes. They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly. With practically
[2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:31.920]  half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps, the traders know they can shut
[2:18:31.920 --> 2:18:38.480]  us down by force. But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially. So be it. Make
[2:18:38.480 --> 2:18:45.080]  them silence us by force. This is the final battle of the information war. Give now by
[2:18:45.080 --> 2:18:52.080]  products, donate before everything changes. We need you to carry us through to the end.

[2:19:59.400 --> 2:20:16.160]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:16.160 --> 2:20:25.440]  All right, former NBA player and current mixed martial arts fighter Royce White is here.
[2:20:25.440 --> 2:20:28.720]  And I was familiar with his work as I had really followed the NBA. The last 20 plus
[2:20:28.720 --> 2:20:32.640]  years I'm just focused on what's happened with the New World Order. I followed it before
[2:20:32.640 --> 2:20:36.720]  that. I was a big sports cub and definitely like basketball and football and golf, baseball,
[2:20:36.720 --> 2:20:39.920]  everything. But I stopped watching it over 20 years ago just to focus on the news. But
[2:20:39.920 --> 2:20:45.120]  he's right. The real brainwashing, the real political power is in the sports and in Hollywood.
[2:20:45.120 --> 2:20:50.720]  And so he tried to do good there and figured out that it was a bigger agenda going on.
[2:20:50.720 --> 2:20:55.920]  And I remember my uncle, my late uncle, was a smart guy, the Vietnam helicopter pilot
[2:20:55.920 --> 2:21:00.600]  and worked in claston clandestine stuff in central and South America. I remember him.
[2:21:00.600 --> 2:21:04.280]  He would always talk about it. He didn't talk a lot about the mystery of evil. And I guess
[2:21:04.280 --> 2:21:09.160]  that's some quote of the Bible about how people that love God have a sixth sense and we have
[2:21:09.160 --> 2:21:12.880]  a connection to each other and discernment. But evil has a discernment and they're able
[2:21:12.880 --> 2:21:18.840]  to network without even talking to each other. And it's real synergy you see. And so that's
[2:21:18.840 --> 2:21:23.560]  really the mystery of evil. And you were talking about that with your own term about this wickedness
[2:21:23.560 --> 2:21:28.120]  and how they really had this very evil agenda. And then finally they can't hide anymore and
[2:21:28.120 --> 2:21:31.480]  go, I don't care about 3 million people in death camps. I don't care if they're killing
[2:21:31.480 --> 2:21:36.240]  thousands of people a day. I mean, they're really showing you who they are. So please
[2:21:36.240 --> 2:21:38.240]  continue on that particular topic.
[2:21:38.240 --> 2:21:45.680]  Yeah. Well, I mean, I think that evil forces have a way of coalescing, right? And they have
[2:21:45.680 --> 2:21:52.880]  a way of building a natural intuition of people who lack metaphysical faith in God and want
[2:21:52.880 --> 2:22:00.160]  to move in a direction further away from God. And I think that the New World Order is largely
[2:22:00.160 --> 2:22:04.400]  predicated on that evil force. Yes, there is direct conspiracy. And we should never
[2:22:04.400 --> 2:22:09.040]  forget that and never overlook that because the evidence of that is right in front of
[2:22:09.040 --> 2:22:15.800]  our face. But there also, what I like to say is when the evidence can't be found, we can
[2:22:15.800 --> 2:22:21.360]  look at the metaphysical to understand how evil forces conspire.
[2:22:21.360 --> 2:22:23.000]  Please continue. That's powerful.
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:27.280]  Well, yeah, and I think a guy like Chometh, you know, I don't know how high up he is
[2:22:27.280 --> 2:22:32.840]  in this. He doesn't, he doesn't strike me as a huge force, a huge decision maker in
[2:22:32.840 --> 2:22:38.360]  this entire movement. But his natural just raise an attitude towards the Uighurs seemed
[2:22:38.360 --> 2:22:44.440]  more spiritual to me. You know, and again, I'm not privy to exactly how involved Chometh
[2:22:44.440 --> 2:22:49.360]  is with this New World Order agenda. But as I see it, the New World Order is a five headed
[2:22:49.360 --> 2:22:55.440]  hybrid of the West. You got big tech, you got the three industrial complexes, medical,
[2:22:55.440 --> 2:23:02.040]  media, military, and you got the central banks. And they view the CCP as the perfect engine
[2:23:02.040 --> 2:23:08.680]  to bring about authoritarian, totalitarian, one government, one currency society. And
[2:23:08.680 --> 2:23:14.920]  you know, it seems that all of them whether directly involved with people like Klaus Schwab
[2:23:14.920 --> 2:23:21.160]  and all Bill Gates or all of these globalist, you know, out, out, outedly admittedly globalist
[2:23:21.160 --> 2:23:27.960]  but pushers, you know, they seem to be privy to try and, you know, shield or cover up for
[2:23:27.960 --> 2:23:32.000]  China when the time comes. And when Chometh is asked about the Uighurs, he just brazenly
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:36.800]  says, look, I don't care. And I don't again, I don't know if that's direct him being in
[2:23:36.800 --> 2:23:41.480]  collaboration at the highest level of this agenda, or if he's just in spirit, you know,
[2:23:41.480 --> 2:23:46.320]  moving further and further away from God. Absolutely. And in spirit is even more important
[2:23:46.320 --> 2:23:50.240]  being inspired by the evil and by that wavelength and even constantly being part of it. But
[2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:54.200]  I think he's been told shut up, go along with it. So he decided to love it. But he shows
[2:23:54.200 --> 2:23:58.440]  real hate in his eyes, his eyes gleam. He's like, I don't care about you. They don't even
[2:23:58.440 --> 2:24:03.320]  rise up to my like their trash. They're not even, they don't even exist. So that's very
[2:24:03.320 --> 2:24:07.960]  evil. He spoke it. I mean, he didn't just say, well, that's not my issue. He, he kind
[2:24:07.960 --> 2:24:11.880]  of showed an enjoyment in that they're not human to him.
[2:24:11.880 --> 2:24:16.960]  Troubling coming from a, you know, I said, oh, my, oh, my God, Jason, we're like show
[2:24:16.960 --> 2:24:23.320]  the other day, we have to be very mindful of these 40 year old, you know, mid 40 year
[2:24:23.320 --> 2:24:30.320]  old cosmopolitan, omnisexual, atheist billionaires, right? And their, their, their incoherence
[2:24:30.320 --> 2:24:35.720]  and logic is actually quite profound. I mean, this guy is, is an immigrant himself. He comes
[2:24:35.720 --> 2:24:41.680]  from a refugee geopolitical situation. Like, you know, let's just say the same thing about
[2:24:41.680 --> 2:24:46.000]  the situation that your people were in. But, but that's, that's how they view the world.
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:50.880]  It's relative. It's all a moral selectiveness that they can determine whenever they want
[2:24:50.880 --> 2:24:55.840]  to suit their own needs. And right now, the needs for him are to ride a global agenda
[2:24:55.840 --> 2:25:02.400]  which expands market and creates this monopolistic sort of synergy amongst evil forces, amongst
[2:25:02.400 --> 2:25:07.520]  atheists. But, but then also, right? It's the, it's the chips in Taiwan. So he'll say,
[2:25:07.520 --> 2:25:11.720]  we don't care about the Uyghurs, but we are concerned about Taiwan. There's nothing more
[2:25:11.720 --> 2:25:15.720]  insulting to the intelligence of free people every where, then when an oligarch says something
[2:25:15.720 --> 2:25:16.720]  like that.
[2:25:16.720 --> 2:25:21.520]  And they flip on the morals when they want and flip them off when they want. And that's
[2:25:21.520 --> 2:25:27.880]  what so many of them say is that I decide when I care, I decide when I don't. I noticed
[2:25:27.880 --> 2:25:35.800]  that's a hallmark of these people. Arbitrary rule changes, arbitrary morality is a hallmark
[2:25:35.800 --> 2:25:46.320]  of authoritarianism and it's a hallmark of evil spiritness. How do we counter that?
[2:25:46.320 --> 2:25:50.160]  Well, I think we have to make a decision right now about American citizenship, to be honest.
[2:25:50.160 --> 2:25:56.080]  I think American citizenship is the first and last line of defense against tyranny
[2:25:56.080 --> 2:26:01.480]  and against evil around the world. And right now, Americans have really dropped the ball
[2:26:01.480 --> 2:26:06.760]  and understanding how our citizenship is being taken from us every day. And it's sort of
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:07.760]  this quid pro quo.
[2:26:07.760 --> 2:26:11.720]  And I see it on the right as well. Like, you know, to me, the left, the left political
[2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:16.880]  ideology is something like, we have to create a manmade solution to deal with all of our
[2:26:16.880 --> 2:26:23.280]  existential anxiety, right? Which, which ultimately comes from them being too far from God. On
[2:26:23.280 --> 2:26:27.680]  the right, you have a metaphysical anchor in some respects, although all of us who say
[2:26:27.680 --> 2:26:32.360]  we're Christian or believers in God aren't necessarily good Christians or firm believers
[2:26:32.360 --> 2:26:33.360]  in God.
[2:26:33.360 --> 2:26:39.080]  But these the right wingers do something like they have a hyper inflated belief in the state.
[2:26:39.080 --> 2:26:44.160]  They don't understand that when lawmakers become corrupt, and the people who enforce
[2:26:44.160 --> 2:26:48.760]  the law are also corrupt, and it all undermines the rule of law. So they have too much belief
[2:26:48.760 --> 2:26:55.440]  in the state, i.e., the situation with police and how there was this, you know, profound
[2:26:55.440 --> 2:27:00.720]  police lives matter in blue lines, support our police, support our troops. But we all
[2:27:00.720 --> 2:27:06.640]  know when the time comes and authoritarianism is at its peak, the police and the troops
[2:27:06.640 --> 2:27:10.120]  who just take marching orders are going to be the ones forcibly vaccinating you and your
[2:27:10.120 --> 2:27:11.120]  kids.
[2:27:11.120 --> 2:27:13.680]  Exactly. And that's where you got the cube movement as well. The government can't be
[2:27:13.680 --> 2:27:17.960]  bad. It's got to be a secret magic group. Everything's really okay because for right
[2:27:17.960 --> 2:27:22.840]  wingers, they had made the state God because we were the Christian country. We really weren't.
[2:27:22.840 --> 2:27:26.360]  And they don't understand individually, they made it the nation that was strong. And so
[2:27:26.360 --> 2:27:30.000]  they had to be delusional that it was too scary to admit. No, the government's captured
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:32.440]  because then you got to actually do something about it.
[2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:38.760]  Well, yeah. And my point is, you know, and I'll say this here, I led all of the peaceful
[2:27:38.760 --> 2:27:43.080]  protests here in Minneapolis after George Floyd was murdered. But I'm not a part of
[2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:47.760]  the Black Lives Matter organization in any regard. Actually, I vehemently oppose all
[2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:52.600]  of their cultural and community methods. And I know that it's a part of a big, bigger agenda
[2:27:52.600 --> 2:27:59.080]  races, this New Creek Card Monty, as well as gender and feminism too. But I will say
[2:27:59.080 --> 2:28:04.680]  this, Black Lives Matter has the right energy. They have the wrong ideas and they have a
[2:28:04.680 --> 2:28:07.080]  poor, a bad motivation, a wicked motivation.
[2:28:07.080 --> 2:28:11.080]  Well, sure, you got Soros and the Globalists, one in street cred, coming out and manipulating
[2:28:11.080 --> 2:28:14.520]  groups of people that actually have real issues and real beef.
[2:28:14.520 --> 2:28:19.680]  And here's what the right has done. And I think it's, this has dropped the ball even
[2:28:19.680 --> 2:28:23.840]  for the populist movement, which I'm a fire-breathing populist. Steve Bannon is a mentor of mine
[2:28:23.840 --> 2:28:29.400]  and I support him and I support the populist movement 100%. But here's what the right
[2:28:29.400 --> 2:28:37.520]  has done. The right has tried to, in a full swipe, denounce BLM for all of its corruptness,
[2:28:37.520 --> 2:28:41.320]  all of its corruption that exists. But they also want to get out of the real revolution
[2:28:41.320 --> 2:28:44.920]  as well, right? They don't want to have to hit the streets and revolt. And that's the
[2:28:44.920 --> 2:28:45.920]  status.
[2:28:45.920 --> 2:28:48.520]  Stay there. I totally agree, Royce White. Instead of going in and recruiting all these
[2:28:48.520 --> 2:28:54.200]  people to be the revolution of populism, no, it then disregards all their real issues
[2:28:54.200 --> 2:28:57.680]  and then just basically negates it. We'll be right back.

[2:30:58.400 --> 2:31:03.800]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[2:31:03.800 --> 2:31:08.360]  a healthier life. Info wars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your
[2:31:08.360 --> 2:31:13.840]  system with a supplement that contains both. This info wars life offering vitamin C plus
[2:31:13.840 --> 2:31:18.960]  zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the info war store. The rose hips contained
[2:31:18.960 --> 2:31:25.400]  within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[2:31:25.400 --> 2:31:30.320]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[2:31:30.320 --> 2:31:34.960]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[2:31:34.960 --> 2:31:39.720]  shown. As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an
[2:31:39.720 --> 2:31:44.800]  important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[2:31:44.800 --> 2:31:49.920]  But it has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[2:31:49.920 --> 2:31:54.960]  like here in America. So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarstore.com
[2:31:54.960 --> 2:32:01.400]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie. If your ruthless mega corporations have taken
[2:32:01.400 --> 2:32:04.920]  over almost every government on earth and who are trying to destroy the middle class
[2:32:04.920 --> 2:32:10.160]  in any form of operability, you've got to divide and conquer the public so they don't
[2:32:10.160 --> 2:32:16.040]  end up being targeted. That's why the Fortune 100 have wrapped themselves, the name of LBGT
[2:32:16.040 --> 2:32:20.840]  and African American rights and all the rest of it all over the world. That's now their
[2:32:20.840 --> 2:32:25.200]  corporate face while they run slave camps in Africa and in communist China and many
[2:32:25.200 --> 2:32:29.520]  other areas, while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through the
[2:32:29.520 --> 2:32:34.640]  big tech of the central banks and other zone. So this is a criminal takeover and when you
[2:32:34.640 --> 2:32:41.520]  look at the new super class, it's the politicians, it's the corporate media, it's the police,
[2:32:41.520 --> 2:32:45.240]  it's the bureaucrats, it's members of Congress and their staff and their families, it's the
[2:32:45.240 --> 2:32:51.960]  White House, hell it's postal workers who were all exempt from the poison shots but
[2:32:51.960 --> 2:32:55.920]  not the general public and everybody else through corporate rule. So this is the true
[2:32:55.920 --> 2:32:58.760]  discrimination that's going on.
[2:32:58.760 --> 2:33:05.760]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:05.760 --> 2:33:16.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[2:33:16.760 --> 2:33:22.760]  so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:22.760 --> 2:33:26.760]  So I don't want to just make claims because some people might not have heard this a month
[2:33:26.760 --> 2:33:33.760]  ago, it was a top story. Shamath Palahatapiti, I'm probably not saying that wrong, Sri Lankan
[2:33:33.760 --> 2:33:39.520]  individual who's a billionaire and owns a big basketball team, just said, I don't care
[2:33:39.520 --> 2:33:45.000]  about these people. Not just, well, I can't help them, they don't even rise up to them.
[2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:49.880]  The arrogance of this, and this is emblematic while he runs around virtue signaling how he
[2:33:49.880 --> 2:33:53.240]  wants to support Black Lives Matter. Here it is.
[2:33:53.240 --> 2:33:59.400]  Nobody cares about what's happening to the weakers, okay? You bring it up because you
[2:33:59.400 --> 2:34:03.480]  really care and I think that's nice that you care. The rest of us don't care. I'm just
[2:34:03.480 --> 2:34:09.280]  telling you a very hard, I'm telling you a very hard ugly truth, okay? Of all the things
[2:34:09.280 --> 2:34:14.360]  that I care about, yes, it is below my line, okay? Of all the things that I care about,
[2:34:14.360 --> 2:34:15.960]  it is below my line.
[2:34:15.960 --> 2:34:22.560]  Now, what did George Soros say in that 60 minutes interview? He said, well, if I wouldn't
[2:34:22.560 --> 2:34:27.400]  have helped round up the Jews, somebody else would've done it, so like the market, I just
[2:34:27.400 --> 2:34:33.360]  picked the winning side. When everyone has that attitude, we all get enslaved and destroyed.
[2:34:33.360 --> 2:34:38.880]  That's conquest versus civilization, and so it's this attitude of it's not my problem,
[2:34:38.880 --> 2:34:43.400]  I'm not gonna worry about it. Well, then what is your problem? Do I stand up for you if somebody
[2:34:43.400 --> 2:34:49.720]  is trying to kill you? It's just such a soulless disconnection and whatever the satanic force
[2:34:49.720 --> 2:34:54.840]  is, the devil behind it, but however people see that in their mind, it is funding and
[2:34:54.840 --> 2:35:00.240]  creating and promoting these type of little pathetic jellyfish, and I'm not putting him
[2:35:00.240 --> 2:35:03.640]  down because he looks wimpy. I mean, I'm probably wimpy compared to you, but the point is there's
[2:35:03.640 --> 2:35:08.360]  something about these little weird, effeminate chicken neck men, like something that's not
[2:35:08.360 --> 2:35:11.280]  right to say effeminate, because they're not like women, women are powerful. They're like
[2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:18.120]  these weird, metrosexual wimps who also then love tyranny, like Tim Cook, it makes me sick.
[2:35:18.120 --> 2:35:24.560]  Well, first I'll say the Uyghur genocide is one of the defining issues, if not the defining
[2:35:24.560 --> 2:35:30.360]  issue of our time. It's a litmus test for all of our ideas about justice and freedom,
[2:35:30.360 --> 2:35:34.920]  and for an institution like the NBA and many of its owners and oligarchs that surround
[2:35:34.920 --> 2:35:41.160]  it who want to make claims about social justice and human welfare and global eradication of
[2:35:41.160 --> 2:35:45.280]  suffering, they certainly have missed the mark with the Uyghur genocide, and I think it should
[2:35:45.280 --> 2:35:53.320]  be a huge indicator to all of us, but I believe that when you become demoralized, before the
[2:35:53.320 --> 2:36:00.440]  mass form psychosis comes demoralization, and when you become demoralized, oftentimes
[2:36:00.440 --> 2:36:06.520]  you're out for tyranny. These people crave tyranny. They want it for themselves, but
[2:36:06.520 --> 2:36:10.040]  in their lack of ability to manifest tyranny for themselves, because they're too weak to
[2:36:10.040 --> 2:36:14.080]  really run roughshod over the people around them, they'll just jump onto a tyrannical
[2:36:14.080 --> 2:36:20.080]  bandwagon, and that's the ethos of this entire beta project that has risen to the top of
[2:36:20.080 --> 2:36:25.840]  a new world order. Royce, Royce, I'm not kissing your ass. You are so damn on target, because
[2:36:25.840 --> 2:36:30.000]  I always mean to try to articulate that. The way you're explaining that is so true. These
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:35.160]  people are weak, and they get reflected glory out of evil, and feel like when bad stuff's
[2:36:35.160 --> 2:36:38.760]  happening, because they pretend and agree with it, that somehow they're winning when
[2:36:38.760 --> 2:36:43.240]  they're not. That is the heart of this, that these people serve something that will destroy
[2:36:43.240 --> 2:36:48.280]  them in the end, because they're missing their soul. They're not connected. They're demoralized,
[2:36:48.280 --> 2:36:49.440]  like you said.
[2:36:49.440 --> 2:36:56.920]  Absolutely. I mean, tyranny is the friend of the lost, and we see that. I know that personally
[2:36:56.920 --> 2:37:03.680]  because let's use gangs, for example, in the inner cities and black communities. There
[2:37:03.680 --> 2:37:11.600]  is a gravity towards this sort of moral relativistic, do whatever it takes to survive it to me or
[2:37:11.600 --> 2:37:18.920]  you. If I can find people who have lost their soul, and they feel that sense of that loss
[2:37:18.920 --> 2:37:23.800]  of civility and morality, then I feel more comfortable next to them than I do standing
[2:37:23.800 --> 2:37:29.160]  up for freedom and justice. In the same way, you could say that the police departments
[2:37:29.160 --> 2:37:33.840]  have fallen victim to that under this corporatocracy, that I'm going to just do my job. I'm going
[2:37:33.840 --> 2:37:39.160]  to just follow orders. But the reality is that, like you said, the people who are getting
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:44.760]  targeted by the establishment, silenced, deplatformed, blackballed, those are the people who need
[2:37:44.760 --> 2:37:50.440]  to rise up and be the leaders in this next generation or else we will perish.
[2:37:50.440 --> 2:37:53.400]  I can ask a lot of questions, but you've got a lot of points to make. Where else should
[2:37:53.400 --> 2:37:55.880]  we go here?
[2:37:55.880 --> 2:38:00.920]  You know, the one that's really been troubling me the most is obviously the vaccine mandates.
[2:38:00.920 --> 2:38:07.640]  For me, I led the protests around the George Floyd situation, and I knew from watching
[2:38:07.640 --> 2:38:12.120]  the situation from afar, as it pertains to politics and corporatocracy and all of these
[2:38:12.120 --> 2:38:19.040]  things, that that moment was going to be used to again further hijack what should be a very
[2:38:19.040 --> 2:38:21.760]  populist movement.
[2:38:21.760 --> 2:38:25.480]  And so I led a protest, for example, from US Bank Stadium where the Vikings play here
[2:38:25.480 --> 2:38:29.680]  in Minneapolis to the front door of the Federal Reserve. And there are only 12 Federal Reserves
[2:38:29.680 --> 2:38:35.040]  and we have one in Minneapolis. And that never made the mainstream media headlines,
[2:38:35.040 --> 2:38:38.960]  but people took notice. And that's kind of how I got hooked up with Steve Bannon and
[2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:45.400]  other populist figures around the country. But, you know, I heard people say this whole
[2:38:45.400 --> 2:38:51.600]  system is guilty, you know, after police, tear the whole system down. Three months later,
[2:38:51.600 --> 2:38:55.960]  you know, they were all in support and in favor and even willing to fight on behalf
[2:38:55.960 --> 2:39:01.520]  of a medical industrial complex that is patently the system. And the fact that they can't separate
[2:39:01.520 --> 2:39:06.880]  the medical industrial complex from the rest of the system shows you how well the psychological
[2:39:06.880 --> 2:39:12.960]  warfare has, well, how successful the psychological warfare has been. And we have to fight back
[2:39:12.960 --> 2:39:17.520]  again. I mean, we just have to dig our heels in. We have to stop being so civil, especially
[2:39:17.520 --> 2:39:22.320]  on the right, especially in the GOP, especially in the Republican Party. Stop being so civil.
[2:39:22.320 --> 2:39:27.200]  Stop believing that we can appeal to reason and logic because certain forces in this world
[2:39:27.200 --> 2:39:31.240]  are not interested in reason or logic. It's not enough. And I love Tucker Carlson. I
[2:39:31.240 --> 2:39:35.880]  think he's got his finger right over the target as well. But it's not enough to just debunk
[2:39:35.880 --> 2:39:39.880]  the logical fallacy because many of them aren't interested in logic anyway. Who's going to
[2:39:39.880 --> 2:39:50.080]  report to the front line when tyranny really rises? Me. I'll be there. And I'll be there
[2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:53.480]  alone if need be. I know you'll be there. I know there are a good number of people in
[2:39:53.480 --> 2:39:58.360]  our society that will be there when the time comes. And we have to get coordinated. We have
[2:39:58.360 --> 2:40:04.320]  to invest as much energy in coordinating with like minds instead of bickering amongst each
[2:40:04.320 --> 2:40:09.040]  other and hiding in our little corners of whatever money we're getting from whatever
[2:40:09.040 --> 2:40:13.680]  interested party. We have to come together and coordinate as much as we believe that
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:18.560]  they have coalesced against us. I totally agree because some of the other bigger shows
[2:40:18.560 --> 2:40:24.040]  literally think that if they network, somebody's wanting money or something, we need money
[2:40:24.040 --> 2:40:27.360]  to operate. Sure, I want money, but it's on my hierarchy of needs. It's not even near
[2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:31.640]  the top. I'm trying to network and empower everybody. I don't care if Joe Rogan's bigger
[2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:35.120]  than me. In fact, I just hope he gets more hardcore. I don't care if Tucker Carlson's
[2:40:35.120 --> 2:40:39.840]  huge. I want him to be. And they figure that out, but so many other people, they still
[2:40:39.840 --> 2:40:43.880]  think it's about a competition between us. We're in a war against the globalist and
[2:40:43.880 --> 2:40:49.640]  the satanic force, and we've got to come together and unify against it and network.
[2:40:49.640 --> 2:40:58.200]  Look, I believe that the neoliberal globalist agenda has hijacked the status quo, right?
[2:40:58.200 --> 2:41:04.680]  They've hijacked the status quo, and now their plan or their strategy is to hold that position
[2:41:04.680 --> 2:41:09.560]  by creating an ever-expanding middle. And they're going to use a twin turbo engine of
[2:41:09.560 --> 2:41:15.640]  the ever-expanding definition of gender and the ever-expanding definition of sexual misconduct.
[2:41:15.640 --> 2:41:21.040]  It's not that everybody's going to subscribe to those lifestyles or those ideologies, but
[2:41:21.040 --> 2:41:25.120]  they're going to be forced to bend the knee through civil normalcy. And I think we saw
[2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:32.360]  Joe Rogan almost sort of waiver on that. And it's not Joe's fault. We need to become
[2:41:32.360 --> 2:41:40.400]  more coordinated and more of a binded for a populist movement to let Joe know that he
[2:41:40.400 --> 2:41:43.000]  should never have to bend and conform to the establishment.
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:46.120]  No, I totally agree because he came out and said, you guys have been wrong about the mask
[2:41:46.120 --> 2:41:50.400]  and the vaccine and everything, but I'm sorry. I'm not smart. I'm sorry. I'll do better.
[2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:55.840]  But I mean, that's him. I know Joe well. That's him giving the Satanist what they think is
[2:41:55.840 --> 2:42:02.560]  a victory. It's kind of a judo move he's doing. But I mean, I'm not going to try to judge
[2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:05.560]  Joe because he's come so far. But yeah, you're right.
[2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:11.120]  Yeah. I mean, I like Joe. I've been a fan of Joe. I think you and Joe's podcast is probably
[2:42:11.120 --> 2:42:16.480]  the best podcast in history. But at the end of the day, I think it's a two prong issue.
[2:42:16.480 --> 2:42:22.480]  One, Joe has to find the courage in his own heart to know just how much of a crisis this
[2:42:22.480 --> 2:42:27.880]  is, which I think he does to some extent. But each battle has a bigger impact on the
[2:42:27.880 --> 2:42:32.800]  overall war. But us as the people around Joe and people like Bannon and people like yourself
[2:42:32.800 --> 2:42:37.960]  and people like Minister Louis Faircon or Dave Chappelle, we have to get louder, as loud
[2:42:37.960 --> 2:42:43.960]  as the church of LGBTQ and let them know that we are here to support them. And that regardless
[2:42:43.960 --> 2:42:48.480]  of whether or not the establishment goes after them, we will be there to support them and

[2:43:59.160 --> 2:44:05.000]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines are
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:12.680]  working for quote, dark forces that the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these
[2:44:12.680 --> 2:44:18.080]  evil groups are. They know that all over the world, their poison shot is being banned by
[2:44:18.080 --> 2:44:23.880]  major governments and Madonna's in trouble as well. They know that the people are starting
[2:44:23.880 --> 2:44:28.960]  to get wise. This depopulation agenda. In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the
[2:44:28.960 --> 2:44:33.840]  shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons, but they're so deadly, they're killing a higher
[2:44:33.840 --> 2:44:41.960]  percentage up front. And so people are waking up. The weapons work a little too good. They're
[2:44:41.960 --> 2:44:47.480]  supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars, but instead they're making too big of a noise.
[2:44:47.480 --> 2:44:52.240]  But it's too late for a return back now. They're coming after our children. So it's up to us
[2:44:52.240 --> 2:44:58.120]  to protect our little children or God will not look favorably on us. Remember, God is
[2:44:58.120 --> 2:45:06.000]  watching get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from people say, why is it from Chiapas,
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:10.280]  Mexico, the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's
[2:45:10.280 --> 2:45:15.320]  wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil better than Guatemala and coffee. And
[2:45:15.320 --> 2:45:19.120]  yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that the media calls communist, but really they're
[2:45:19.120 --> 2:45:23.040]  just a commune. And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[2:45:23.040 --> 2:45:26.160]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over. So I actually buy this from the
[2:45:26.160 --> 2:45:29.400]  Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone
[2:45:29.400 --> 2:45:34.040]  up. The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[2:45:34.040 --> 2:45:36.720]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere. It's Wake
[2:45:36.720 --> 2:45:41.760]  Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally. In fact, I'm going to tell
[2:45:41.760 --> 2:45:48.760]  you a little story. We have like that. Okay, if you want to believe it. Anyway, so it's
[2:45:48.760 --> 2:45:53.600]  infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation. And if you don't find us and don't
[2:45:53.600 --> 2:46:00.600]  want to share, that's fine.
[2:46:53.600 --> 2:47:20.840]  Alright, final segment with our guests and Paul Watson takes over. I want to invite Roy
[2:47:20.840 --> 2:47:24.680]  Swight back anytime he wants. I'm starting to do commercial free podcasts that got a
[2:47:24.680 --> 2:47:28.160]  lot of viewers who would buy them back to that and to come on any other shows or host
[2:47:28.160 --> 2:47:34.800]  a four hours of movie like Roy Swight is at Roy Swight dot substack.com. And I followed
[2:47:34.800 --> 2:47:38.040]  some of your work, but just during the break looking at it, you know, you're getting into
[2:47:38.040 --> 2:47:41.480]  call written house, you're getting into the satanic temple, you're getting into all these
[2:47:41.480 --> 2:47:45.360]  areas when I see similar between you and I and most people that care about justice or
[2:47:45.360 --> 2:47:49.760]  think all of us is we start out from a position of trying to help just because we want to
[2:47:49.760 --> 2:47:53.280]  help people and then we figure out people are blocking that and we think, oh, maybe they're
[2:47:53.280 --> 2:47:58.400]  just dumb. And then as you fight that, you learn, no, there's really a evil program
[2:47:58.400 --> 2:48:03.840]  going on. And as you said, it's a spiritual program where they're following like a broadcast
[2:48:03.840 --> 2:48:08.000]  and in higher levels, it gets organized. But realizing that is key. And then realize there's
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:11.720]  also networks of good people.
[2:48:11.720 --> 2:48:17.000]  I 100% agree with you. I think, you know, part of this entire big tech social media
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:24.040]  movement has been to make common people docile. The common folk have continued to vote and
[2:48:24.040 --> 2:48:27.920]  purchase against their own interests now for many, many election cycles. So that's one
[2:48:27.920 --> 2:48:36.200]  issue. But I think the biggest issue in my opinion is Christians right now. Our Christian
[2:48:36.200 --> 2:48:41.240]  brother and brothers and sisters, especially on the right in America in the Republican
[2:48:41.240 --> 2:48:46.960]  party, for example, seem to have this viewer approach that says when all is said and done,
[2:48:46.960 --> 2:48:51.800]  God will sort it out. You hear Jesus is coming back. These are the end times. God has the
[2:48:51.800 --> 2:48:57.760]  final say. Of course, I agree with those things. I'm a Christian. I grew up Catholic. But they
[2:48:57.760 --> 2:49:05.560]  seem to have overlooked that there are righteous and divine wars. And once again, the criticism
[2:49:05.560 --> 2:49:11.600]  on BLM is for the logical fallacy that does exist. But it's also to weasel their way out
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:17.880]  of righteous and divine war that needs to be fought physically, possibly out in the streets
[2:49:17.880 --> 2:49:23.720]  in this country. And that's something that I caution us towards is, yes, God will have
[2:49:23.720 --> 2:49:29.040]  the final say, but he's also equipped us with the knowledge and the faith and the spirit
[2:49:29.040 --> 2:49:32.160]  to know when it's time to actually fight a righteous and divine war.
[2:49:32.160 --> 2:49:40.520]  I 100% agree that faith without works is dead. And God is in charge just like the sun makes
[2:49:40.520 --> 2:49:45.480]  plants grow, but we're the plants. We're supposed to interface with that. And we have a job
[2:49:45.480 --> 2:49:50.360]  to do to oppose the Siebel and take action against it. We can't just sit back and say,
[2:49:50.360 --> 2:49:53.440]  well, I'm not going to breathe because God ought to do it for me. No, you got to breathe.
[2:49:53.440 --> 2:49:56.240]  You're going to, I mean, I'm not going to get up and cook my breakfast. I'm not going
[2:49:56.240 --> 2:49:59.160]  to get up and mow the lawn. I'm not going to get up and change the baby diaper. God ought
[2:49:59.160 --> 2:50:04.120]  to do that. No, you've got to do that. God helps those that helps themselves. Then God
[2:50:04.120 --> 2:50:09.880]  gives us the inspiration and the discernment and the spirit to prevail if we have courage
[2:50:09.880 --> 2:50:12.840]  because God hates cowards.
[2:50:12.840 --> 2:50:16.600]  And the question we should all ask ourselves or what we should put on trial internally,
[2:50:16.600 --> 2:50:21.040]  which is why mental health is probably still the greatest social issue we face is the mental
[2:50:21.040 --> 2:50:25.080]  health topic is the one that forces you to look in the mirror. And in looking in the mirror,
[2:50:25.080 --> 2:50:30.240]  we have to ask ourselves, are we refraining from the divine and righteous war because
[2:50:30.240 --> 2:50:36.480]  we think God has a better or bigger plan? Or are we really interested in our own sense?
[2:50:36.480 --> 2:50:42.400]  And I think a lot of it, especially in the GOP establishment with the neocons and the
[2:50:42.400 --> 2:50:46.960]  rhinos and many of those who are still on the fence and against Donald Trump and, you
[2:50:46.960 --> 2:50:51.320]  know, all of those things, I think many people are still interested in their own sense more
[2:50:51.320 --> 2:50:54.000]  so they are doing the work of God.
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:58.320]  Well, that's how it works is you have sin, it blocks you from God. And then the Holy
[2:50:58.320 --> 2:51:02.600]  Spirit says, get out of the way. I'll take control, but then you don't want to get the
[2:51:02.600 --> 2:51:06.800]  sin out of the way. So then God can't come through.
[2:51:06.800 --> 2:51:11.920]  Absolutely. Absolutely. And, you know, look, I know there are many good people, great people
[2:51:11.920 --> 2:51:19.240]  who don't believe in God. But us as Christians, we do. Here's part of what the globalist
[2:51:19.240 --> 2:51:24.520]  move is. And I think Christians aren't privy to this yet, or they don't see the urgency
[2:51:24.520 --> 2:51:30.000]  in that in a global society where citizenship is lifted, and you have the rise of an atheist
[2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:36.560]  movement, the two billion Christians that are a majority demographic now become a minority.
[2:51:36.560 --> 2:51:41.560]  And while all of these leftist movements want to talk about the persecution of women, black
[2:51:41.560 --> 2:51:47.520]  people, Latinos, minorities, the LGBTQ, whoever else they want to say, which is really a three
[2:51:47.520 --> 2:51:53.240]  card Monty, the next people to get rounded up in this country and around the world are
[2:51:53.240 --> 2:51:58.160]  going to be Christians. And the example is or believers in God, let's say, and the example
[2:51:58.160 --> 2:52:03.440]  was already taking place in China, and their capitulation and their support of China is
[2:52:03.440 --> 2:52:05.720]  an indicator of what's to come for the rest of us.
[2:52:05.720 --> 2:52:10.080]  Well, Royce, you said it, they're either going to be unified by Christ and that energy
[2:52:10.080 --> 2:52:14.160]  or going to be unified by something else, the beast, the anti Christ, which is a global
[2:52:14.160 --> 2:52:19.680]  social credit score AI surveillance grid that when you follow its directives like a robot,
[2:52:19.680 --> 2:52:23.920]  it lets you live and have food, but you've given up your free will and gone beyond a
[2:52:23.920 --> 2:52:28.520]  wave. And so that's really it. God gives us the Holy Spirit, real power, all the gifts,
[2:52:28.520 --> 2:52:33.000]  everything is good. But it's going to come against that. And it's going to say, we can
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:38.960]  see it now manifesting, but it's also a revelation. Our world would be perfect. We can all unify
[2:52:38.960 --> 2:52:43.920]  spiritually and be one mind if we just had these Christians out of the way. And that's
[2:52:43.920 --> 2:52:49.120]  what the Satanists actually say in their deeper writings, not, you know, naked cheerleaders,
[2:52:49.120 --> 2:52:54.280]  devils, you know, race cars, that's not really the devil folks, but, but is, is total unification
[2:52:54.280 --> 2:52:58.680]  of thought under its spirit and its control. And they believe once they've killed all the
[2:52:58.680 --> 2:53:02.760]  Christians, then the utopia begins because they could sync with Lucifer.
[2:53:02.760 --> 2:53:07.120]  Right, right. And what, and what Chometh did there, you know, you can just, you can just
[2:53:07.120 --> 2:53:11.680]  imagine your Henry kissing jurors and your cloud swabs, making the phone call and saying,
[2:53:11.680 --> 2:53:15.440]  man, would somebody get this kid Chometh under control because he's trying to pull the mask
[2:53:15.440 --> 2:53:19.240]  off too directly. And we're not ready for that all out assault on the two billion Christians
[2:53:19.240 --> 2:53:25.800]  just yet. But, but that was playing with, with, with that energy. And, you know, the,
[2:53:25.800 --> 2:53:32.360]  the West though, the West has four heresies or particular heresies throughout history.
[2:53:32.360 --> 2:53:37.440]  Okay. The first was a scientific method. Then you had democracy. Then you had computer
[2:53:37.440 --> 2:53:42.520]  technology and the fourth is going to be artificial intelligence. And all of it is this attempt
[2:53:42.520 --> 2:53:48.520]  to reconcile the gap between us and God through manmade invention. And, and, and, and so,
[2:53:48.520 --> 2:53:53.160]  and I say that because I think there are people who are good scientists. I think there are
[2:53:53.160 --> 2:53:57.920]  people who are, who believe in democracy. I think there's utility to computers. I think
[2:53:57.920 --> 2:54:03.200]  artificial intelligence may even have a place in our society. But the, the overall commitment
[2:54:03.200 --> 2:54:08.040]  to them, the indoctrination, the dogma of these four heresies is really an indicator
[2:54:08.040 --> 2:54:12.240]  of our, our distance from God and our distance from goodness really. And that's why all of
[2:54:12.240 --> 2:54:18.600]  these industries and their success and their market share is really predicated on one central
[2:54:18.600 --> 2:54:25.160]  human downfall impulse, right? And temperance. And, and that's what Christian doctrine teaches.
[2:54:25.160 --> 2:54:30.240]  It's one of the four cardinal sins, right? And, and all, but it's porn, social media,
[2:54:30.240 --> 2:54:36.240]  drugs, the list goes on and on and on in temperance, impulse, giving away to your fleshly needs,
[2:54:36.240 --> 2:54:40.360]  right? And not having the real sense of self and a sense of, of a, of a bigger picture
[2:54:40.360 --> 2:54:46.120]  or metaphysical. You're absolutely right. And, and they're trying to get us to, to give
[2:54:46.120 --> 2:54:50.000]  up that higher connection and just plug into it. But if we look at all those things you
[2:54:50.000 --> 2:54:54.400]  mentioned, because we're a Republican on a democracy, all of them destroy the individual
[2:54:54.400 --> 2:54:58.480]  and enslave us in the end. So they all sound great. They all look good. They all have things
[2:54:58.480 --> 2:55:03.160]  that work, but there's an evil force using those to knit them together to destroy us
[2:55:03.160 --> 2:55:10.440]  and, and, and make us weak. And they all suggest that no goodness and earth can ever again
[2:55:10.440 --> 2:55:15.480]  come from the individual, that it all has to come through this authoritarian, totalitarian
[2:55:15.480 --> 2:55:21.160]  edict, right? That, and that, and that's the real bait and switch, that we're the only
[2:55:21.160 --> 2:55:25.520]  ones who can usher in goodness, right? And that's a direct heresy of God in the first
[2:55:25.520 --> 2:55:30.800]  place. But again, that, that's kind of the ethos of this, putting AI and the technocrats
[2:55:30.800 --> 2:55:36.720]  that run it. That's like TA 61138 as God. It's just, it's like this superclass is God.
[2:55:36.720 --> 2:55:40.080]  And then they're like the worst people ever.
[2:55:40.080 --> 2:55:45.320]  There is no God. We are God. We will decide what's good and what's wrong. We will arbit,
[2:55:45.320 --> 2:55:49.960]  be the arbiters of, of morality. And when we need to, we'll be selective because some
[2:55:49.960 --> 2:55:55.720]  of you just aren't as valuable as we are, like the Uighurs. And, and we need to move
[2:55:55.720 --> 2:56:00.080]  forward with our agenda. And if the Uighurs stand in the way between our relationship
[2:56:00.080 --> 2:56:05.760]  with the CCP and the greater good they could bring about in our futurist technocrat world,
[2:56:05.760 --> 2:56:07.920]  then the Uighurs are, are, are no moss.
[2:56:07.920 --> 2:56:10.840]  Why do you think they're trying to wipe them out? Obviously they want the land. I know
[2:56:10.840 --> 2:56:15.480]  they break the women and make them, you know, have Chinese babies. But why do they really
[2:56:15.480 --> 2:56:17.640]  want to wipe them out?
[2:56:17.640 --> 2:56:23.440]  Well, I think they're, they were a vulnerable population. And I think that China sees them
[2:56:23.440 --> 2:56:28.080]  as, as a, you know, it's called testing the waters. And I was watching, you know, studying
[2:56:28.080 --> 2:56:32.280]  up for today and going back and looking at some of your work, you said that they test
[2:56:32.280 --> 2:56:35.760]  you with some of these things. Like when they put something in the paper or a magazine
[2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:39.600]  and they float an idea that they plan on really going after, they want to see what the people
[2:56:39.600 --> 2:56:40.600]  will do.
[2:56:40.600 --> 2:56:43.560]  So they took a vulnerable population like the Uighurs and they said, let's see how the
[2:56:43.560 --> 2:56:48.560]  world will react in, during a second Holocaust or a second global genocide. Let's see where
[2:56:48.560 --> 2:56:54.800]  we are today. The George Floyd one almost brought things to the brink, but the race
[2:56:54.800 --> 2:56:59.760]  issue divided the true populist movement that needed to emerge out of that situation.
[2:56:59.760 --> 2:57:05.360]  See my, my view on the state, the reason why I viewed George Floyd as a pertinent issue
[2:57:05.360 --> 2:57:10.080]  is because the state has a monopoly on violence and the monopoly on violence is the proper
[2:57:10.080 --> 2:57:15.080]  mechanism for the state. I actually believe that the state should have a monopoly on violence
[2:57:15.080 --> 2:57:19.640]  as long as there is an abundance of corruption. And the abundance of corruption is what makes
[2:57:19.640 --> 2:57:24.720]  George Floyd's murder in a cop or the actions of police officers so detrimental to the rule

[3:00:03.480 --> 3:00:07.120]  Well there's a lot of great men out there and we're not singling out women and saying
[3:00:07.120 --> 3:00:11.280]  you're not important but in history it's men that are designed and made to stand up against
[3:00:11.280 --> 3:00:16.120]  corrupt forces and that's why they've tried to remove men from the equation but we've
[3:00:16.120 --> 3:00:21.960]  got an amazing man Roy Swight of RoySwight.substack.com here where this former NBA player current
[3:00:21.960 --> 3:00:27.360]  MMA fighter but really I like him because he's a smart guy and he understands what's
[3:00:27.360 --> 3:00:33.520]  going on and he's fighting back. In closing what do you think Biden's going to pull in
[3:00:33.520 --> 3:00:37.200]  the next 278 days for the election? What do you think is going on with Russia? Just big
[3:00:37.200 --> 3:00:42.200]  picture, gut level. What are you most concerned about? Because obviously I think the globalists
[3:00:42.200 --> 3:00:46.160]  are in big trouble. Their systems falling apart but we know biblically that's why they
[3:00:46.160 --> 3:00:50.440]  try to take over is the stay in power. So it's this constant process and then they get
[3:00:50.440 --> 3:00:55.360]  their antichrist for just a short period. It's collapsing even as they build it. I mean
[3:00:55.360 --> 3:00:59.440]  you can see it manifesting. Mark of the Beast, world government it's all happening. I think
[3:00:59.440 --> 3:01:03.000]  you went back to Christians. Where are the churches? I go to a lot of churches. They're
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:06.840]  nice preachers whatever but they're too scared to tell their flock anything scary. Well we're
[3:01:06.840 --> 3:01:10.320]  not trying to scare people. We're trying to tell them that hey you know this is going
[3:01:10.320 --> 3:01:19.080]  on so we can stop it. Well I think the great mechanism is fear right now. You don't have
[3:01:19.080 --> 3:01:24.120]  enough power as a citizen or as an individual to really make a dent in what we have planned
[3:01:24.120 --> 3:01:30.160]  and that's why I think you will see more and more institutions, more and more people who
[3:01:30.160 --> 3:01:34.120]  have credentials. You know people who are doctors such as Dr. Robert Malone and they
[3:01:34.120 --> 3:01:40.120]  will sound the alarms that will wake up smaller groups of people but ultimately the global
[3:01:40.120 --> 3:01:46.640]  agenda is arrogant. It's motivated and it will move forward through these checkpoints
[3:01:46.640 --> 3:01:51.360]  and as it gets resistance it will become more tyrannical. It will double down on tyranny
[3:01:51.360 --> 3:01:55.080]  and the actions will become more drastic. That's already what really happened in these
[3:01:55.080 --> 3:01:58.480]  last years. You just said it's setting up the checkpoints of total enslavement right
[3:01:58.480 --> 3:02:02.120]  now. It's putting us in the cage right now and folks they're not just putting us in a
[3:02:02.120 --> 3:02:07.280]  cage to be nice to us. They're going to hurt us once we're in the cage.
[3:02:07.280 --> 3:02:12.000]  Absolutely and that's why I want to go back and address one thing and make it very clear.
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:16.720]  I don't necessarily believe that those who may have been involved in a Black Lives Matter
[3:02:16.720 --> 3:02:23.120]  agenda that the right or that the populist movement can reconcile the ideological gaps.
[3:02:23.120 --> 3:02:28.120]  What I do know to be a fact is that there are many people who have been voting Democrat
[3:02:28.120 --> 3:02:32.720]  for a long time. Many people who were out there protesting for George Floyd who don't
[3:02:32.720 --> 3:02:36.720]  even know what the Uyghurs are. Who don't even know what the Federal Reserve is and
[3:02:36.720 --> 3:02:43.600]  how it functions. Now do they have a spirit of that leans towards sin and in that they
[3:02:43.600 --> 3:02:50.480]  are more prone to gravitate towards leftist ideologues? Absolutely. But there are some
[3:02:50.480 --> 3:02:56.000]  on that side that can come into the fold and expand what is needed as a real genuine populist
[3:02:56.000 --> 3:03:02.240]  revolution in this country. And I'm there and I was there to go in and get whatever
[3:03:02.240 --> 3:03:09.560]  voices that were left in that area and pull them into a broader truth about what's going
[3:03:09.560 --> 3:03:13.400]  on in this country. And I think our churches need to do more of that. They need to do more
[3:03:13.400 --> 3:03:19.120]  genuine pilgrimage out in the community that is risky, dangerous and in the direct firing
[3:03:19.120 --> 3:03:22.280]  line of the enemy. Well that's right. We got to get the prodigal
[3:03:22.280 --> 3:03:28.400]  sons. We got to get everybody. Absolutely. I'm very disappointed. I have a friend of
[3:03:28.400 --> 3:03:33.720]  the family that's an NBA ref and he asked for religious exemption for the vaccine mandate
[3:03:33.720 --> 3:03:39.000]  for the referees there in the NBA. And he was told by the NBA that, hey, the pope, the
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:45.960]  pope says the vaccine is good. So even the pope now has been weaponized in his centrism
[3:03:45.960 --> 3:03:52.120]  I'll say to put it nicely in his centrism. His words have been weaponized to force citizens
[3:03:52.120 --> 3:03:59.440]  to get vaccinated. And that shows you just how high up and how widespread, you know,
[3:03:59.440 --> 3:04:02.960]  the lack of courage. Well, it's the news. Exactly. It's the new
[3:04:02.960 --> 3:04:09.920]  sacrament is GMO secret concoctions into our bodies to be able to buy and sell. It is literally
[3:04:09.920 --> 3:04:13.480]  revelation coming true. And I say we got to stop it, folks. We're in a fight. You have
[3:04:13.480 --> 3:04:18.000]  the biggest awakening ever during this period. And then God comes in and wins at the end.
[3:04:18.000 --> 3:04:22.680]  But we're in that fight. We're on the team. And we've got to stand up because this is
[3:04:22.680 --> 3:04:26.440]  all a big test. I want to thank you so much for joining us. The website Royce White dot

[3:06:02.360 --> 3:06:11.440]  com. New studios in the United Kingdom. You are listening to Paul Joseph Watson. We are
[3:06:11.440 --> 3:06:17.760]  live at the summit news hour and we've got a lot of news to cover this hour as ever. First
[3:06:17.760 --> 3:06:21.400]  though, I'm going to get into what should be the biggest story in the world right now.
[3:06:21.400 --> 3:06:26.040]  It isn't. There's basically no mainstream media coverage whatsoever. The day after this
[3:06:26.040 --> 3:06:31.080]  came out, the day after it proved us right in everything that we've been saying about
[3:06:31.080 --> 3:06:35.960]  this pandemic about this lockdown for the past two years, the kind of stuff that goes
[3:06:35.960 --> 3:06:42.400]  viral, the kind of stuff that gets fact checked by the esteemed information authorities, the
[3:06:42.400 --> 3:06:48.120]  Ministry of Truth is never this kind of information because they can't fact check it. They can't
[3:06:48.120 --> 3:06:54.160]  debunk it. They can only distract from it. And that's precisely what's happened in the
[3:06:54.160 --> 3:07:00.200]  media landscape over the past two days. And I'm talking about not just one study, but
[3:07:00.200 --> 3:07:09.280]  a major meta analysis of 24 different studies proving that lockdown had no impact whatsoever
[3:07:09.280 --> 3:07:15.240]  on preventing death, on stopping the spread of the pandemic. This is Johns Hopkins University
[3:07:15.240 --> 3:07:21.320]  study. This is up on summit dot news. Lockdowns have had little to no public health effects
[3:07:21.320 --> 3:07:27.880]  and quote imposed enormous economic and social costs. Again, this came out two, three days
[3:07:27.880 --> 3:07:33.440]  ago, it's received nowhere near the coverage of the traction that it fundamentally deserves.
[3:07:33.440 --> 3:07:39.040]  And I'm going to get into it in depth because we can't let them just brush over this. This
[3:07:39.040 --> 3:07:45.200]  proves everything we've said right in triplicate. They can't dismiss it as the rantings of fake
[3:07:45.200 --> 3:07:50.080]  news conspiracy theorists. They can't fact check it. Again, they can only distract from
[3:07:50.080 --> 3:07:55.600]  it. A new study out there and now Johns Hopkins University has concluded that global lockdowns
[3:07:55.600 --> 3:08:00.720]  have had a much more detrimental impact on society than they have produced any benefit
[3:08:00.720 --> 3:08:06.480]  with researchers urging that they are ill founded and should be rejected. That's a quote.
[3:08:06.480 --> 3:08:12.720]  Lockdowns from Johns Hopkins University are quote ill founded and should be rejected as
[3:08:12.720 --> 3:08:19.080]  a pandemic policy instrument. This is what we were saying before the first lockdown.
[3:08:19.080 --> 3:08:23.120]  Why are we locking down the healthy? Why are we not just protecting the vulnerable? That's
[3:08:23.120 --> 3:08:28.720]  what we've done in every instance previously. Why are we following China's draconian communist
[3:08:28.720 --> 3:08:35.600]  restrictions only now? As the world economic forum moves towards its great reset agenda.
[3:08:35.600 --> 3:08:40.960]  Well, we know why, but this proves it in triplicate and that's why it's being ignored. The study
[3:08:40.960 --> 3:08:46.360]  was authored by Jonas Herbie, special advisor at the Center for Political Studies in Copenhagen,
[3:08:46.360 --> 3:08:50.560]  Denmark and a bunch of other experts which we list in this article, which by the way
[3:08:50.560 --> 3:08:56.920]  is the master article of all the top experts who we've been desperately trying to showcase
[3:08:56.920 --> 3:09:02.600]  to amplify telling the public, warning the public that lockdowns are causing more harm
[3:09:02.600 --> 3:09:08.880]  than good, esteemed experts, not expert enough for the mainstream media, the kind of experts
[3:09:08.880 --> 3:09:15.720]  that get de-platformed and silenced even though their credibility is beyond question.
[3:09:15.720 --> 3:09:21.840]  The authors wrote, quote, while it's meta-analysis and again it's 24 different studies across
[3:09:21.840 --> 3:09:25.720]  the world that they're looking at includes that lockdowns have had little to no public
[3:09:25.720 --> 3:09:30.600]  health effects. They have imposed enormous economic and social costs where they have
[3:09:30.600 --> 3:09:36.200]  been adopted. That's getting into poverty, that's getting into hunger, and it's not
[3:09:36.200 --> 3:09:41.000]  even getting into the vast number of people who have mistreatments being denied cancer
[3:09:41.000 --> 3:09:45.960]  treatments, treatments for all these other horrible illnesses as the entire health industry
[3:09:45.960 --> 3:09:52.880]  went 100% Covid, Covid obsession. The focus of the study according to the authors was
[3:09:52.880 --> 3:09:57.560]  to, quote, determine whether there is empirical evidence to support the belief that lockdowns
[3:09:57.560 --> 3:10:03.640]  reduce Covid-19 mortality. They define lockdowns as any government mandate that directly restricts
[3:10:03.640 --> 3:10:07.600]  people's possibilities such as politics that limit internal movement, close schools and
[3:10:07.600 --> 3:10:13.640]  businesses and ban international travel. They saw or they further noted that, quote,
[3:10:13.640 --> 3:10:18.000]  to answer our question we focused on studies that examine the actual impact of lockdowns
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:24.760]  on Covid-19 mortality rates based on a number of different factors. Did lockdowns reduce
[3:10:24.760 --> 3:10:32.040]  Covid deaths? The conclusion of this esteemed study of 24 different studies is no, quote,
[3:10:32.040 --> 3:10:38.600]  lockdowns have had little to no effect on Covid-19 mortality. That's it, that's your
[3:10:38.600 --> 3:10:45.600]  narrative gone, rubber stamped, thrown out in the bin. More specifically, index studies
[3:10:45.600 --> 3:10:52.600]  find that lockdowns in Europe and the United States only reduce Covid-19 mortality by 0.2%
[3:10:52.600 --> 3:11:00.080]  on average, 0.2%. And then when you factor in all the missed cancer screenings appointments,
[3:11:00.080 --> 3:11:06.240]  you're not being able to see specialists for their myriad of health morbidities which
[3:11:06.240 --> 3:11:11.960]  pre-existed Covid, existed during the lockdowns and will exist at an exacerbated level far,
[3:11:11.960 --> 3:11:18.080]  far into the future. Thanks to lockdown doesn't even include the impact of that and even absent
[3:11:18.080 --> 3:11:26.840]  all that 0.2% impact on Covid-19 mortality without all the attendant devastation that
[3:11:26.840 --> 3:11:33.480]  lockdowns have caused. It adds shelter-in-place orders were also ineffective, only reducing
[3:11:33.480 --> 3:11:39.760]  Covid-19 mortality by 2.9% on average. Further noting specific non-pharmaceutical intervention
[3:11:39.760 --> 3:11:45.280]  studies also find no broad-based evidence of noticeable effects on Covid-19 mortality.
[3:11:45.280 --> 3:11:51.840]  What do they mean by non-pharmaceutical intervention? Masks, specifically masks, mandates which
[3:11:51.840 --> 3:11:56.320]  are still in place in numerous states across the United States, across Europe, across the
[3:11:56.320 --> 3:12:02.560]  world and have had no effect whatsoever, yet they still claim that masks work. There's
[3:12:02.560 --> 3:12:08.200]  literally no study that says they have any meaningful impact, never has been for their
[3:12:08.200 --> 3:12:15.360]  entire two years of the pandemic. The authors conclude, quote, our meta-analysis fails to
[3:12:15.360 --> 3:12:22.440]  confirm that lockdowns have had a large significant effect on mortality rates. They analysed lockdown
[3:12:22.440 --> 3:12:27.280]  versus no lockdown, face masks, closing non-essential businesses, border closures, school closures
[3:12:27.280 --> 3:12:33.080]  and limiting gatherings and also found, quote, no broad-based evidence of noticeable effects
[3:12:33.080 --> 3:12:41.840]  on Covid-19 mortality. That's it, bottom line, 24 different global studies, esteemed experts
[3:12:41.840 --> 3:12:48.840]  looking at it from a perspective, a meta-analysis of all those studies and they found no evidence
[3:12:48.840 --> 3:12:54.600]  that lockdowns prevent the spread of the virus and, in fact, the psychological, the catastrophic
[3:12:54.600 --> 3:13:00.160]  health impacts that lockdowns have had on the population. As we've quoted top experts
[3:13:00.160 --> 3:13:06.280]  as saying, we'll kill more people than the lives saved by lockdown, which, according
[3:13:06.280 --> 3:13:15.400]  to this, at best was 0.2%. Again, I say this is the master article for this because we've
[3:13:15.400 --> 3:13:20.600]  quoted numerous other experts who have been amplifying for the past two years, including
[3:13:20.600 --> 3:13:26.960]  Professor Carol Secora, NHS consultant oncologist, who said there would be 50,000 excess deaths
[3:13:26.960 --> 3:13:33.440]  from cancer as a result of the first lockdown, not even including the ones after it. Professor
[3:13:33.440 --> 3:13:40.280]  Richard Sullivan, his title is literally Professor of Cancer. Okay, he's an expert, he's one
[3:13:40.280 --> 3:13:44.400]  of your vaunted esteemed experts, also warned there'll be more excess cancer deaths in
[3:13:44.400 --> 3:13:50.120]  the UK than total coronavirus deaths due to people's access to screenings and treatment
[3:13:50.120 --> 3:13:55.520]  being restricted as a result of lockdown. Peter Nielsen, Swedish professor of internal
[3:13:55.520 --> 3:14:00.480]  medicine and epidemiology, said it's so important to understand that the deaths of COVID-19
[3:14:00.480 --> 3:14:08.000]  will be far less than the deaths caused by societal lockdown when the economy is ruined.
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:13.040]  We also flashed back to a major study by German scientists at Munich University who found
[3:14:13.040 --> 3:14:20.520]  that lockdowns had no effect on reducing Germany's coronavirus infection rate. Quote, no direct
[3:14:20.520 --> 3:14:25.800]  connection between the German lockdown and falling infection rates in the country. No
[3:14:25.800 --> 3:14:32.840]  correlation whatsoever, yet they did it again, again, again and again. He previously reported
[3:14:32.840 --> 3:14:36.840]  on academics from Duke, Harvard and Johns Hopkins, including there could be around a
[3:14:36.840 --> 3:14:43.680]  million excess deaths over the next two decades as a result of lockdowns. This should be the
[3:14:43.680 --> 3:14:48.920]  biggest story in the world, it should be the biggest story for weeks on end. It's received
[3:14:48.920 --> 3:14:55.400]  barely a whimper of coverage from the media. Headline, Johns Hopkins Professor Slam's
[3:14:55.400 --> 3:15:02.320]  media own institution for hiding bombshell study that found lockdowns are ineffective.
[3:15:02.320 --> 3:15:07.000]  He went on Tucker Carlson to state Johns Hopkins itself did not even put out a press release
[3:15:07.000 --> 3:15:10.800]  about this study. If you look at the media coverage, it's one of the biggest stories
[3:15:10.800 --> 3:15:15.600]  in the world today, yet certain media outlets have not even covered it. He said they haven't
[3:15:15.600 --> 3:15:19.320]  covered it because, quote, people may already have written their own narrative about the
[3:15:19.320 --> 3:15:24.640]  effectiveness of lockdowns. They are desperate not to be proven wrong. There's an entire
[3:15:24.640 --> 3:15:31.840]  cottage industry that sprung up of experts who constantly amplify and recycle theamongering
[3:15:31.840 --> 3:15:37.840]  hand in hand with state bureaucracies, governments, media elites who want the clicks, the click
[3:15:37.840 --> 3:15:44.080]  bait, I want people inside sat on their backsides watching television. They love the reviews,
[3:15:44.080 --> 3:15:48.800]  the views, they love the audience figures, they love the giant checks from pharmaceutical
[3:15:48.800 --> 3:15:54.920]  companies like Pfizer, and it's all for nothing. It's all one big grift. Summit.News will
[3:15:54.920 --> 3:15:56.480]  be back.

[3:17:56.080 --> 3:17:59.920]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome. Hello
[3:17:59.920 --> 3:18:03.840]  Alex. Yes, Malcolm. All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other
[3:18:03.840 --> 3:18:08.920]  patrons can get on the line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts
[3:18:08.920 --> 3:18:14.360]  Owen Shroyer. Super male volatility and brain force plus. Mix those two together. You're
[3:18:14.360 --> 3:18:19.480]  an unstoppable tank. Super male volatility really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs
[3:18:19.480 --> 3:18:25.080]  and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect
[3:18:25.080 --> 3:18:29.320]  compared to powdered versions. It also worked quite well but just aren't as strong. This
[3:18:29.320 --> 3:18:34.440]  is like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong,
[3:18:34.440 --> 3:18:37.400]  sometimes it's just okay. People are like, why are you selling something and admitting
[3:18:37.400 --> 3:18:42.280]  sometimes the batch isn't as strong? That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's
[3:18:42.280 --> 3:18:46.800]  always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls
[3:18:46.800 --> 3:18:51.720]  Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[3:18:51.720 --> 3:19:01.200]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world from Australia to
[3:19:01.200 --> 3:19:05.240]  the United States from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you
[3:19:05.240 --> 3:19:09.720]  do everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually
[3:19:09.720 --> 3:19:14.960]  taking people away into the night to their facilities. And they're planning in the next
[3:19:14.960 --> 3:19:19.840]  year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people
[3:19:19.840 --> 3:19:23.720]  away and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than martial
[3:19:23.720 --> 3:19:28.560]  law. And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[3:19:28.560 --> 3:19:32.440]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government

[3:19:56.960 --> 3:20:20.880]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:20.880 --> 3:20:37.080]  Live from the summit.news headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:37.080 --> 3:20:46.320]  It's quite ironic that before the first lockdown right at the start of the pandemic back in
[3:20:46.320 --> 3:20:54.200]  January, February 2020, we saw the proliferation, the amplification of videos of people on the
[3:20:54.200 --> 3:21:01.600]  streets of China in different cities collapsing suddenly convulsing on the ground being forced
[3:21:01.600 --> 3:21:06.640]  to have medical treatment on the spot. In some cases, apparently dying because they
[3:21:06.640 --> 3:21:13.720]  caught COVID. We now know that that was complete BS. It was likely part of psychological operations
[3:21:13.720 --> 3:21:19.440]  to convince people that this was a disease, a pandemic that was far more deadly than it
[3:21:19.440 --> 3:21:25.020]  in reality was. You know that governments orchestrated entire propaganda campaigns based
[3:21:25.020 --> 3:21:31.440]  on that premise, weaponizing behavioral psychology to make people more terrified of the virus
[3:21:31.440 --> 3:21:36.480]  than they needed to be. So they would comply. So they would submit. So they would be obedient
[3:21:36.480 --> 3:21:41.960]  in vast numbers without questioning what was happening. Turns out that that was all again
[3:21:41.960 --> 3:21:48.120]  propaganda, a side effect of catching COVID isn't suddenly collapsing in the street and
[3:21:48.120 --> 3:21:55.040]  convulsing. But what we have seen over the past several months is people in peak physical
[3:21:55.040 --> 3:22:02.480]  condition suddenly collapsing and convulsing for real in some cases surviving thankfully,
[3:22:02.480 --> 3:22:07.080]  but in others tragically dying. And these cases, unlike the ones that happen in China
[3:22:07.080 --> 3:22:14.400]  as part of psychological operations, are very real indeed. And particularly affected by
[3:22:14.400 --> 3:22:19.840]  this have been footballers soccer players as our American audience would refer to them
[3:22:19.840 --> 3:22:25.720]  throughout Europe and indeed other sportsmen throughout the world. And there's been yet
[3:22:25.720 --> 3:22:32.960]  another example of this that has come to light today. Bear in mind that last weekend alone,
[3:22:32.960 --> 3:22:38.400]  we have three different incidents in football stadiums in England alone, where spectators
[3:22:38.400 --> 3:22:43.960]  in the crowd collapsed suddenly had to be taken away by paramedics. Now that happens
[3:22:43.960 --> 3:22:50.880]  on rare occasions. It doesn't happen in three different football stadiums on one afternoon
[3:22:50.880 --> 3:22:57.320]  without something seriously going on. And it's also happening to young professional soccer
[3:22:57.320 --> 3:23:05.240]  players, another of whom has tragically died. His name is Alexandros Lampis. He is a Greek
[3:23:05.240 --> 3:23:11.080]  footballer. And he suffered a sudden cardiac arrest just five minutes into a game before
[3:23:11.080 --> 3:23:16.920]  subsequently dying. Again, headline 21 year old Greek football suffers sudden cardiac
[3:23:16.920 --> 3:23:23.680]  arrest during game. This was at the first municipal stadium yesterday. He was playing
[3:23:23.680 --> 3:23:32.000]  for a third division team, just five minutes into the game. He collapsed with heart problems.
[3:23:32.000 --> 3:23:35.920]  There was no defibrillator at the stadium. The ambulance took 20 minutes to arrive.
[3:23:35.920 --> 3:23:42.600]  They couldn't resuscitate him. And he tragically died. You see clips here of other sports professionals
[3:23:42.600 --> 3:23:49.160]  in different tournaments, different sports suffering the exact same fate. Now the Daily
[3:23:49.160 --> 3:23:53.480]  Mail reported quote football has been rocked by a series of high profile incidents among
[3:23:53.480 --> 3:23:59.160]  players. And boy, you can say that again. But again, the Daily Mail is the same publication
[3:23:59.160 --> 3:24:05.280]  that carried an article saying experts have dismissed it as just a coincidence. They
[3:24:05.280 --> 3:24:12.480]  list some of the names here. Sergio Aguero, who had just completed a major transfer to
[3:24:12.480 --> 3:24:17.480]  Barcelona football club. He was one of the world's most well renowned players forced
[3:24:17.480 --> 3:24:22.840]  to retire after experiencing chest pains playing for Barcelona. They're also scared for Victor
[3:24:22.840 --> 3:24:28.960]  Lindelof, Pierre Emmerich, Obama Yang. This season, Wigan striker Charlie Wick collapsed
[3:24:28.960 --> 3:24:35.040]  in training. Sheffield United's John Fleck, again, 28 years old, 30 years old, collapsed
[3:24:35.040 --> 3:24:40.040]  on the pitch at Redding, Adama Triore, 25 years old, went down, clutching his chest while
[3:24:40.040 --> 3:24:45.600]  playing in the Champions League. The Sheriff Tourist Sport, Icelandic midfielder Emile
[3:24:45.600 --> 3:24:53.040]  Pounson, also required resuscitation after a cardiac arrest in October. These are all
[3:24:53.040 --> 3:24:58.520]  healthy young men whose entire career is dedicated to maintaining peak physical health for peak
[3:24:58.520 --> 3:25:06.160]  physical performance. Early 20s, mid 20s, late 20s, early 30s, suffering cardiac arrest,
[3:25:06.160 --> 3:25:11.800]  breathing difficulties, collapsing, in some cases, tragically dying. We showcased another
[3:25:11.800 --> 3:25:17.680]  example a few weeks ago, 25 year old, Guatemalan soccer star Marcus Meneldo, again, collapsed
[3:25:17.680 --> 3:25:22.440]  during training, tragically died shortly after being rushed to hospital.
[3:25:22.440 --> 3:25:27.680]  Now German newspaper Berliner Zeitung published a report that last November, a few months
[3:25:27.680 --> 3:25:32.680]  ago now, seeking to answer why, quote, an unusually large number of professional and
[3:25:32.680 --> 3:25:38.360]  amateur soccer players have collapsed recently. Somebody did a statistical analysis and found
[3:25:38.360 --> 3:25:44.440]  that there was about a 4,000% increase in this happening amongst professional soccer players
[3:25:44.440 --> 3:25:50.240]  over the course of the last year. And again, I go back to the example of Fabrice Muamber,
[3:25:50.240 --> 3:25:57.480]  who I think it was 2011 or 2012, while playing again, I think it was for Bolton Wanderers,
[3:25:57.480 --> 3:26:02.600]  collapsed clutching his heart, required resuscitation. Many people thought he would die. He was down
[3:26:02.600 --> 3:26:08.400]  on the pitch for a good 20, 30 minutes. It was a massive, huge story at the time because
[3:26:08.400 --> 3:26:14.720]  it was so rare that young, fit, healthy professional athlete would suddenly collapse on the pitch
[3:26:14.720 --> 3:26:20.960]  with heart problems. At the time, there was a big outcry. There was a big call for a massive
[3:26:20.960 --> 3:26:27.120]  investigation into why this had happened because again, it was so rare. Now it happens several
[3:26:27.120 --> 3:26:32.960]  times a week, but the experts are sure as that it's just a coincidence. Now, when anyone
[3:26:32.960 --> 3:26:39.080]  tries to talk about it on national radio stations, for example, like X England football at
[3:26:39.080 --> 3:26:44.880]  Travis and Claire, and we featured this video before, when it's reported that yet another
[3:26:44.880 --> 3:26:49.080]  professional has collapsed and died or has been taken to hospital, he brought up the
[3:26:49.080 --> 3:26:53.640]  question of vaccines. Somebody on the big red button, the big delay button there at
[3:26:53.640 --> 3:26:59.040]  talk sport radio station, didn't press it in time and he just got the word vaccine out
[3:26:59.040 --> 3:27:04.480]  and then he was cut off and then the screen faded to black. Interesting that, isn't it?
[3:27:04.480 --> 3:27:10.440]  Of course, Dr Peter McCulloch, who was responsible partly for the massive targeting of Joe Rogan
[3:27:10.440 --> 3:27:16.400]  and the attempt to de-platform him by the regime, pointed out that myocarditis has become
[3:27:16.400 --> 3:27:23.320]  at least 50% more common than predicted by US public health experts. And he said that
[3:27:23.320 --> 3:27:27.200]  could be one of the links, that could be one of the explanations why these top athletes
[3:27:27.200 --> 3:27:33.920]  are suddenly collapsing. Matthew Latissier, another X England footballer, came out and
[3:27:33.920 --> 3:27:38.520]  called for an investigation because there's no call amongst the establishment for one,
[3:27:38.520 --> 3:27:43.960]  despite the fact again that there was a massive uproar when one football player had this condition
[3:27:43.960 --> 3:27:49.760]  10 years ago, there was a massive outcry demand for investigation. Now it's multiple times
[3:27:49.760 --> 3:27:56.400]  weekly and everybody's strangely silent. Latissier said, quote, it's been very concerning for
[3:27:56.400 --> 3:28:01.200]  me watching the sport I love and I played for 17 years. In all that time that I played,
[3:28:01.200 --> 3:28:07.800]  I never once saw any footballer leave the pitch because of heart issues. You went on
[3:28:07.800 --> 3:28:10.640]  to say, no, I'm sorry, but if anybody can look at what's happening down the world of
[3:28:10.640 --> 3:28:15.480]  sport and say it's normal for all these players to be having heart issues in football matches,
[3:28:15.480 --> 3:28:19.680]  cricket matches, basketball matches, any sport you wish these people the amount of
[3:28:19.680 --> 3:28:25.160]  people that are suffering is going through the roof. And we have yet another example
[3:28:25.160 --> 3:28:32.480]  of that today with the tragic death of 21 year old Greek footballer, Aleksandros Lampis,
[3:28:32.480 --> 3:28:37.520]  thoughts and prayers go out to his family. But unfortunately, he's become another victim
[3:28:37.520 --> 3:28:42.640]  of this mysterious sudden collapse illness, which just happened to come about six months
[3:28:42.640 --> 3:28:48.720]  ago when everybody started getting double dosed. Gee, I wonder if there's any connection.
[3:28:48.720 --> 3:29:00.360]  We'll be back with all the craziness going on in the world with the globalist plotting
[3:29:00.360 --> 3:29:05.920]  their next big lockdown with the next phase of the great reset being a stage cyber attack
[3:29:05.920 --> 3:29:12.320]  with the deep state pushing a civil war not just here, but in Europe and war with Russia
[3:29:12.320 --> 3:29:17.520]  with the massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place like supply chain

[3:33:01.040 --> 3:33:16.160]  order it's alex jones broadcasting internationally from the summit dot news headquarters in the
[3:33:16.160 --> 3:33:26.880]  united kingdom it's paul joseph watson as the covid narrative collapses the rebellion continues to
[3:33:26.880 --> 3:33:32.960]  grow we're gonna talk about the mask mandate protests sweeping american schools in a moment
[3:33:32.960 --> 3:33:39.840]  but on that subject we had this headline yesterday 70 of americans say it's time to accept covid and
[3:33:39.840 --> 3:33:47.840]  get on with our lives oh no you can't say that the technocrats need their prestige they need their
[3:33:47.840 --> 3:33:55.120]  television appearances they need their great reset but a new mom with paul finds that 70 of americans
[3:33:55.120 --> 3:34:00.800]  think it's time to live with covid and get on with their lives and rather interestingly as i point
[3:34:00.800 --> 3:34:06.960]  out in this article those who have been infected with covid are more likely to want society to move
[3:34:06.960 --> 3:34:12.960]  on from it than those who haven't again proving that those who haven't think it's this deadly killer
[3:34:12.960 --> 3:34:17.520]  that's going to wipe them out not turned out to be the case with the vast majority of people of
[3:34:17.520 --> 3:34:23.920]  course we've featured the statistics before where even for the over 70s the survival rate of covid is
[3:34:23.920 --> 3:34:31.840]  over 97 percent increasingly greater numbers when you go down through the age groups now fully seven
[3:34:31.840 --> 3:34:37.040]  in 10 americans agree with the sentiment that quote it's time we accept covid is here to stay and we
[3:34:37.040 --> 3:34:42.720]  just have to get on with our lives including 78 percent of those who report having gotten covid
[3:34:42.720 --> 3:34:48.320]  and 65 percent of those who say they've not been infected so again if you've had it you're more likely
[3:34:48.320 --> 3:34:54.800]  to say not a big deal let's move on the main difference predictably was between republicans
[3:34:54.800 --> 3:35:01.280]  and democrats 47 percent of democrats say we should move on so you've still got a slight majority
[3:35:01.280 --> 3:35:07.440]  who are absolutely predicated on maintaining this covid pandemic religion and imposing it on everyone
[3:35:07.440 --> 3:35:15.440]  else even as the fever for it the anticipation the drive for it fails amongst the american public
[3:35:15.440 --> 3:35:19.440]  so the poll numbers will make problematic reading for those who have turned made taking multiple
[3:35:19.440 --> 3:35:24.480]  vaccines and vehemently supporting lockdown mandates and mass rules into a high status symbol
[3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:30.160]  religion the one downside of this poll was the the number of americans who think the pandemic
[3:35:30.160 --> 3:35:34.720]  will be under control by the end of the year is only 34 percent which again suggests that they
[3:35:34.720 --> 3:35:40.160]  know the technocrats will try to prolong it for as long as possible before the next promised pandemic
[3:35:40.160 --> 3:35:47.040]  that bill gates says we've got waiting for us but 28 percent think a return to normal life will
[3:35:47.040 --> 3:35:53.200]  never happen ever again entrenching this idea that these covid rules are going to become like the
[3:35:53.200 --> 3:36:00.480]  post 9 11 rules not being allowed to take liquids or carry on luggage akin to being forced to wear
[3:36:00.480 --> 3:36:07.360]  masks everywhere but on the subject of masks post millennial reports la mayor defends going maskless
[3:36:07.360 --> 3:36:13.360]  in photo with maddie johnson because he held his breath i guess mask man i guess if i just go
[3:36:13.360 --> 3:36:20.000]  through the airport or go into a shop or go into a library or a sports stadium or wherever and just
[3:36:20.000 --> 3:36:25.600]  say well i held my breath then you don't need to wear a mask it's good enough for uh los angeles
[3:36:25.600 --> 3:36:32.400]  mayor eric garcetti it's good enough for governor uh governor gavin newson to not wear a mask well
[3:36:32.400 --> 3:36:38.240]  that has rankled some parents throughout california headline hundreds of students segregated in
[3:36:38.240 --> 3:36:44.160]  gyms after protesting school mask mandates and in fact let's first go to this clip not from california
[3:36:44.160 --> 3:36:51.360]  but from washington state same activist cause though students walking into school refusing to wear
[3:36:51.360 --> 3:36:56.240]  masks there was one student who gave an eloquent speech about why they were doing this and why
[3:36:56.240 --> 3:37:02.560]  they were doing this and why optics were so important in doing this and this was posted on twitter it
[3:37:02.560 --> 3:37:09.200]  got over a million views it went viral let's play this speech by the student outside the school in
[3:37:09.200 --> 3:37:20.400]  washington state here it is everybody shut up this is not an excuse for any of you freshmen
[3:37:20.400 --> 3:37:26.240]  and sophomores to disrespect your teachers if i hear of anybody disrespecting teachers or staff
[3:37:26.240 --> 3:37:35.120]  tomorrow that makes us look bad we want this to be a peaceful respectful movement we are just
[3:37:35.120 --> 3:37:42.960]  trying to gain back our rights as citizens we do not care about the teachers in the end are just
[3:37:42.960 --> 3:37:52.000]  doing their jobs it doesn't come from them it comes from the state now what we're hoping is
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:56.560]  that they kick us out this sounds bad but we're hoping that they kick us out because they have to
[3:37:56.560 --> 3:38:01.440]  report that tendons to the state and if the state sees a day we're a hundred or i don't even know
[3:38:01.440 --> 3:38:09.280]  how many kids are here are absent they're gonna start asking questions our hope is is we can get
[3:38:09.280 --> 3:38:16.480]  this statewide now i might get in trouble for this but the plan still stands for wednesday for tomorrow
[3:38:16.480 --> 3:38:22.480]  i mean everybody is going to meet at the back row of the senior parking lot and we're all walking
[3:38:22.480 --> 3:38:28.560]  into the school with no mask on you can get me in trouble they can suspend me i don't care
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:37.200]  we're done with this and obviously all of you are too shut up shut up obviously all you are
[3:38:37.200 --> 3:38:45.520]  done with the mask too now again we're doing this peacefully and respectfully if a staff member asks
[3:38:45.520 --> 3:38:51.600]  you to put a mask on you say no thank you and keep walking and if they kick you out then go home
[3:38:52.720 --> 3:38:58.080]  and if people need rides home then some of the seniors i'm sure we can start giving people rides
[3:38:58.080 --> 3:39:13.840]  home that was an eloquent speech by a young man outside washugal high school in washington state
[3:39:14.400 --> 3:39:20.000]  again in anticipation of them walking into the school without wearing face masks this also
[3:39:20.000 --> 3:39:26.480]  took place across california headline hundreds of students segregated in gyms after protesting
[3:39:26.480 --> 3:39:33.280]  school mask mandates again they were responding to both the la mayor and images of governor gavin
[3:39:33.280 --> 3:39:39.920]  newson maskless at a 49ers rams football game of the weekend and it was organized with the
[3:39:39.920 --> 3:39:46.240]  blessing and involvement of the parents there's one of them quoted in an article here from kcr a3
[3:39:47.760 --> 3:39:52.000]  jennifer henry she said our own governor doesn't follow these rules so why should our children
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:57.120]  have to be wearing a mask he's at this football game with all these people yeah because they know
[3:39:57.120 --> 3:40:02.240]  the virus is nowhere near as bad as they tell everyone else it is that's one of the reasons
[3:40:02.240 --> 3:40:08.000]  why they don't wear masks or follow any of the rules another parent jennifer poth said a eight
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:13.120]  year old son went to school without a mask on tuesday prompting school officials to call her on
[3:40:13.120 --> 3:40:20.720]  the phone oh my god the horror they called me to ask me to pick him up and i refused i said no
[3:40:20.720 --> 3:40:26.000]  it's your job to educate my son he has every right to be there so what they decided to do
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:32.960]  to this eight-year-old dissident this thought criminal this non-mask wearer was to force him
[3:40:32.960 --> 3:40:39.360]  to go outside in 43 degree weather and sit there to do school work now when this was made public
[3:40:39.360 --> 3:40:46.560]  the superintendent dave klein had to issue an apology kcr a3 reports more students district
[3:40:46.560 --> 3:40:51.840]  wide went to class without a mask on wednesday and indeed there are videos showing hundreds of
[3:40:51.840 --> 3:40:59.760]  high schoolers being forced to sit in cafeterias gyms segregated socially distanced because they
[3:40:59.760 --> 3:41:07.680]  dare flout the covid pandemic religion so that's a big positive development of course the uh
[3:41:07.680 --> 3:41:13.920]  uk government did a study of face masks in schools before they introduced face masks in schools
[3:41:13.920 --> 3:41:18.880]  and their own study found they had no impact whatsoever but they just went ahead and introduced
[3:41:18.880 --> 3:41:24.480]  them anyway of course the upshot of that in the uk vast numbers of kids just refused to wear them
[3:41:25.200 --> 3:41:31.840]  so again the resistance continues to spread across both sides of the atlantic of course this is
[3:41:31.840 --> 3:41:37.280]  another article which should have been one of the biggest stories for a week it was reported by a
[3:41:37.280 --> 3:41:45.040]  tiny local news station speech therapist 364 percent surge in baby and toddler referrals
[3:41:45.040 --> 3:41:53.360]  thanks to mask wearing how many parents do you see i saw one a baby in a pram wearing a friggin
[3:41:53.360 --> 3:41:59.680]  face mask you see toddlers you see young kids being forced to wear face masks there's not even any
[3:41:59.680 --> 3:42:05.600]  rule or law and never has been that kids of that age have to wear face masks their parents are so
[3:42:05.600 --> 3:42:12.640]  petrified they may can do it anyway i mean how to what degree can you claim ignorance or to what
[3:42:12.640 --> 3:42:21.600]  degree is that literal child abuse speech therapist jaslin feek told w pbf news that she's received
[3:42:21.600 --> 3:42:30.320]  a 364 percent increase in babies and toddlers being unable to cognitively develop speech patterns
[3:42:30.320 --> 3:42:36.400]  because they can't read people's faces they can't lip read that's how they develop language skills
[3:42:36.400 --> 3:42:42.160]  now they're screwed we've had reports of mean IQ scores of young children born during the pandemic
[3:42:42.160 --> 3:42:48.640]  tumbling by as much as 22 points because of cognitive development problems caused by mask

[3:47:46.240 --> 3:47:53.120]  side effects bear in mind this is the same pope pope francis who a few months ago called on big tech
[3:47:53.120 --> 3:48:00.080]  quote in the name of god he invoked the lord almighty to censor quote hate speech again
[3:48:00.080 --> 3:48:07.280]  another completely arbitrary term defined by political extremes in the name of god
[3:48:07.280 --> 3:48:13.360]  censor hate speech which is of course free speech now he's calling on fact checkers to

[3:48:25.600 --> 3:48:32.400]  hope headline protester interrupts pope to assert face masks are not of the church of god
[3:48:33.120 --> 3:48:37.200]  this happened during the pope's general audience yesterday morning and it was caught on camera
[3:48:38.240 --> 3:48:44.400]  the protester calmly stood up and said the church is not the way god wants it before adding quote
[3:48:44.400 --> 3:48:50.080]  masks are not the church of the church of god again he was calmly explaining his position
[3:48:50.080 --> 3:48:56.320]  as he removed his face mask and held it aloft the pope basically responded and said oh he's
[3:48:56.320 --> 3:49:01.200]  suffering tried to make him out make out as if he was mentally ill when he obviously wasn't
[3:49:01.200 --> 3:49:06.000]  he obviously wasn't some disturbed arranged individual trying to cause a scene he was very
[3:49:06.560 --> 3:49:14.000]  eloquent very calm in explaining his grievance but i guess at least the pope didn't say he was
[3:49:14.000 --> 3:49:20.960]  doing the work of the devil which is the slur he uses against all his other critics meanwhile
[3:49:22.160 --> 3:49:28.400]  still in europe we have eric zemore we have the french presidential election coming up in april
[3:49:28.400 --> 3:49:35.600]  2022 marina le pen in a poll that came out today has pulled up to within five points of president
[3:49:35.600 --> 3:49:42.080]  immanuel macron of course she's buying to be the main right-wing populist contender to macron
[3:49:42.080 --> 3:49:48.240]  with eric zemore zemore himself came out a few days ago with a very interesting policy
[3:49:48.240 --> 3:49:55.520]  to boost yes god forbid boost native domestic birth rates in france and i made a short video
[3:49:55.520 --> 3:50:01.520]  about this subject here is the clip french presidential candidate eric zemore is vowing
[3:50:01.520 --> 3:50:07.200]  to fund a nativist baby boom the choir brand intellectual says he'll give parents in rural
[3:50:07.200 --> 3:50:13.920]  areas of the country 10 000 euros for each new child they have the goal is to raise birth rates
[3:50:13.920 --> 3:50:19.040]  amongst the french and quote take back the countryside the idea is similar to a policy
[3:50:19.040 --> 3:50:25.040]  enacted by victor orban in hungary he offered over 30 000 euros to married couples who have three
[3:50:25.040 --> 3:50:29.600]  children the loan has to be repaid until the couple have three children but after that the
[3:50:29.600 --> 3:50:35.840]  debt is completely forgiven zem's clever baby bonus policy 10 000 euros per baby but only to
[3:50:35.840 --> 3:50:40.880]  families in rural areas nothing for the urbanites who hate him politics is about rewarding your
[3:50:40.880 --> 3:50:46.800]  supporters and for this proposal zemore has been demonized as a racist i bet he hasn't heard that
[3:50:46.800 --> 3:50:51.840]  one before helping french people have bigger happier families and leading more financially
[3:50:51.840 --> 3:50:56.720]  stable lives how dare he that money could have surely been spent better on convincing everyone
[3:50:56.720 --> 3:51:03.120]  of the unquestionable certainty of the fact that diversity is a strength 10 000 euros is 10 times
[3:51:03.120 --> 3:51:08.080]  less than the cost of social assistance to foreigners it's 20 times less than the cost of
[3:51:08.080 --> 3:51:14.000]  benefit fraud in france and it's infinitely less expensive than the futile unforgivable task of
[3:51:14.000 --> 3:51:20.880]  rejuvenating france's notorious migrant crime-ridden ghettos the most popular baby name in france's
[3:51:20.880 --> 3:51:27.040]  neighbour belgium the de facto eu capital brussels is mohammed recently published data showed that
[3:51:27.040 --> 3:51:32.480]  islamic names made up 43 percent of total registrations in the belgian city in france
[3:51:32.480 --> 3:51:38.000]  demographic replacement is an integral election issue unlike in many other countries including
[3:51:38.000 --> 3:51:44.720]  america it's considered at least somewhat socially acceptable to be allowed to talk about it another
[3:51:44.720 --> 3:51:51.600]  presidential candidate said he wanted france to remain french i know dreadful right both police
[3:51:51.600 --> 3:51:56.160]  and active duty military in france have warned political leaders that thanks to the ethnic
[3:51:56.160 --> 3:52:02.080]  separatism caused by runaway illegal immigration the country is on the brink of civil war meanwhile
[3:52:02.080 --> 3:52:07.760]  a poll by harris revealed that the majority of french people are concerned about quote european
[3:52:07.760 --> 3:52:13.120]  white and christian populations being threatened with extinction as a result of muslim immigration
[3:52:13.120 --> 3:52:17.600]  turns out that populating your country with people from failed third world states who have no
[3:52:17.600 --> 3:52:23.200]  understanding or respect for western principles isn't necessarily a good thing it causes huge
[3:52:23.200 --> 3:52:31.840]  problems wow who knew down the subject of uh spending too much money to prove that diversity
[3:52:31.840 --> 3:52:37.120]  is a strength we have this headline today brit's told to reduce living standards as government spends
[3:52:37.120 --> 3:52:45.040]  four point seven million pounds a day on housing refugees in hotels so the bank of england came
[3:52:45.040 --> 3:52:50.000]  out today and said they were raising interest rates they say that gdp is going to be slashed
[3:52:50.000 --> 3:52:55.760]  they say inflation will surpass seven percent of course mainly due to disastrous lockdown policies
[3:52:55.760 --> 3:53:02.640]  eco mentalism uh green taxes so we're gonna have to tighten our belts but guess what they've got money
[3:53:02.640 --> 3:53:11.600]  for housing refugees in four star hotels four point seven million pounds a day goes on that expense
[3:53:11.600 --> 3:53:16.640]  they initially said it was one point two million a day then said there was an accounting error
[3:53:16.640 --> 3:53:22.240]  and it turns out taxpayers in the uk are footing the bill to the tune of four point seven million a
[3:53:22.240 --> 3:53:31.280]  day 25 000 migrants to be housed in hotels again cheek by jowl with holiday makers by the way and
[3:53:31.280 --> 3:53:35.840]  if you go and read the reviews of those hotels where the migrants sustained with the holiday makers
[3:53:36.400 --> 3:53:42.720]  they're not exactly five star let's go to another story now which just happened before i came on air
[3:53:43.520 --> 3:53:50.080]  black actress actress cries apologizes to darker skinned actresses for not being black enough
[3:53:50.080 --> 3:53:58.320]  this is uh thandui newton who says she's mortified at not being black enough and wants to apologize
[3:53:58.320 --> 3:54:04.400]  every day to darker skinned actresses we have a clip of her explaining this and breaking down
[3:54:04.400 --> 3:54:11.520]  and blubbering about it and here it is you must have got my note though i put it on your truck
[3:54:11.520 --> 3:54:18.000]  yesterday i now realize that my internalized prejudice was stopping me from feeling like
[3:54:18.000 --> 3:54:26.160]  i could play this role when it's precisely that prejudice that i've received doesn't matter but
[3:54:26.160 --> 3:54:32.320]  it's from african-american women more than anyone else doesn't matter i received prejudice anyone
[3:54:32.320 --> 3:54:37.680]  who's received oppression and prejudice feels this character i've wanted so desperately to
[3:54:37.680 --> 3:54:44.480]  apologize every day to darker skinned actresses to say i'm sorry that i'm the one chosen my mama looks
[3:54:44.480 --> 3:54:54.000]  like you it's been very painful to have women that look like my mom feel like i'm not representing
[3:54:54.000 --> 3:55:01.520]  them that i'm taking from them taking their men taking their work taking their truth but i do think
[3:55:01.520 --> 3:55:08.400]  that any women of color who've whether they're pale or whatever who've managed to help other actors
[3:55:08.400 --> 3:55:18.720]  you know get into this business we matter whenever they say that black women have watched the movie
[3:55:20.080 --> 3:55:25.760]  and it's really really really mattered to them i just thank god that my light skin
[3:55:25.760 --> 3:55:31.280]  didn't stop that from happening i'm so that it didn't cause more pain
[3:55:31.280 --> 3:55:41.920]  so again we're now at the level of bat insane crazy intersectionalism and racial grievance
[3:55:41.920 --> 3:55:49.440]  that this actress is literally apologizing for not being black enough her mother is black you
[3:55:49.440 --> 3:55:56.320]  heard her oh my mama looks like you she's literally crying about and apologizing over the fact that
[3:55:56.320 --> 3:56:02.880]  she's got a white dad oh my god she's got a white dad so she's not black enough to play this character
[3:56:02.880 --> 3:56:10.160]  by the way it's okay to be white this movie they already replaced the old white guy as the lead
[3:56:10.160 --> 3:56:17.840]  character the movie is called god's country reports sky news it's been adapted from a short story by
[3:56:17.840 --> 3:56:24.000]  james lee berk but has swapped the lead character from an older white man into a black woman so
[3:56:24.000 --> 3:56:31.280]  they've already dismissed and replaced the old white man the bigoted old honky with a black woman
[3:56:31.280 --> 3:56:37.120]  but that's not enough she has to go on camera in an interview and start crying about the fact
[3:56:37.120 --> 3:56:43.200]  that she's not black enough like who is offended over this in the first place you've already replaced
[3:56:43.200 --> 3:56:50.400]  the whitey surely that's something to be celebrated right no because she's got a white dad she feels
[3:56:50.400 --> 3:56:57.200]  guilty and she feels like she has to blubber on camera about it absolutely incredible i guess
[3:56:57.200 --> 3:57:03.600]  another example of institutionalized white privilege as is this headline london nightclub
[3:57:03.600 --> 3:57:10.480]  charges straight white males six times more than ethnic minorities for entry london nightclub
[3:57:10.480 --> 3:57:14.640]  organizes stoke controversy by charging straight white men an entry fee six times higher than the
[3:57:14.640 --> 3:57:21.600]  price gays or members of an ethnic minority had to pay now why any straight white men would
[3:57:21.600 --> 3:57:28.720]  seriously entertain the notion of going to pussy palace at the e1 nightclub for this evening of
[3:57:28.720 --> 3:57:34.560]  total debauchery and degeneracy is anyone's guess but i guess if you wanted to go to it you had to
[3:57:34.560 --> 3:57:41.280]  fork out 112 pounds which is about 150 dollars because your white i guess again that's another
[3:57:41.280 --> 3:57:44.880]  example of white privilege i'm just gonna wrap it up summit dot news
