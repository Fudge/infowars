[00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.432]  Thursday, November 24th, the year 2022.
[00:00:11.432 --> 00:00:12.472]  It is Thanksgiving.
[00:00:12.472 --> 00:00:15.094]  This is our special Thanksgiving broadcast.
[00:00:15.094 --> 00:00:17.355]  And I want to thank you all for joining us today.
[00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:19.857]  I want to tell you what's coming up.
[00:00:19.857 --> 00:00:29.002]  I did a hour and a half interview with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny a few weeks ago that listeners and viewers that saw it really gave us great reviews from.
[00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:35.126]  So we're going to be airing that Dr. Sherry Tenpenny interview with me coming up in
[00:00:35.546 --> 00:00:36.286]  I think so.
[00:00:50.894 --> 00:00:56.536]  Tomorrow on the Friday edition, we're going to have that special David Icke interview, George Christensen, Mike Adams, and more.
[00:00:56.536 --> 00:01:02.197]  And I just want to wish you all an amazing Thanksgiving, and I'm just very, very thankful for all of you and what you've done.
[00:01:02.197 --> 00:01:09.719]  I wanted to hit a story that came out a few days ago on Infowars.com that I've not yet gotten to that's so important.
[00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:19.182]  High-end fashion brand ads shows young kids holding sex-bondage teddy bears with child porn court papers in the background.
[00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:19.762]  And it's literal.
[00:01:21.261 --> 00:01:29.956]  Bondage, torture, S&M dolls with what looks like three or four year olds.
[00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:32.200]  There's a whole bunch of this that's really hard to look at.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.964]  And then on the desk in front of them are court papers.
[00:01:36.707 --> 00:01:37.007]  I don't know.
[00:01:54.216 --> 00:02:00.062]  They're a cult, and as Owen Troyer said a few days ago, you just cannot compromise with this level of evil.
[00:02:00.062 --> 00:02:03.566]  I don't even want to say the name of the company on air and give them any attention.
[00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:11.013]  It's one of the top luxury brands in the world, and they sell sunglasses and shoes and bags and clothing and jewelry.
[00:02:12.234 --> 00:02:14.236]  And it's just absolutely, truly disgusting.
[00:02:14.236 --> 00:02:17.058]  Again, the headline, high-end fashion brand.
[00:02:17.058 --> 00:02:22.862]  Ad shows young kids holding sex-bonded teddy bears with child porn court papers in the background.
[00:02:22.862 --> 00:02:24.003]  This is who we're dealing with.
[00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:32.089]  This is the type of people that are waging war on our civilization, on our children, because they know they've got to destroy the innocence of the future if they're going to win.
[00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.016]  Now here at InfoWars, we are not selling stuff using child porn marketing.
[00:02:38.016 --> 00:02:47.647]  We're marketing health and immune system and the fact that when you buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, it funds the InfoWar and it funds freedom and it funds the human resistance and it funds pro-life.
[00:02:48.638 --> 00:02:51.159]  And right now we have the biggest sale in our history.
[00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:57.122]  Yes, it's been going on for about a month or so, between 40 and 60% off with promo code 1776 and double Patreon points.
[00:02:57.122 --> 00:03:04.305]  But now we've added only until December 1st, because we've estimated that all the products will sell out by then that we've got set aside as free gifts.
[00:03:05.484 --> 00:03:09.806]  You will get a free gift with every single order at infowarestore.com.
[00:03:09.806 --> 00:03:20.390]  And some are inexpensive items, some are expensive items, some are InfoWars flags or American flags, some are DVD films, some are books, some are InfoWars sticker packs, some are Alex Jones Halloween masks.
[00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.233]  I mean, there's just hundreds of different items that are being offered that are randomly selected by the shopping cart computer.
[00:03:26.693 --> 00:03:28.334]  When you do each order.
[00:03:28.334 --> 00:03:29.894]  So that's the best that we've ever offered.
[00:03:29.894 --> 00:03:34.315]  It's a clearance sale to get the money in we need during this bankruptcy to make sure we stay on air.
[00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:41.198]  We're doing Chapter 11, Subchapter 5, which means we will stay on air as long as we can be profitable into the future.
[00:03:41.198 --> 00:03:43.438]  And the court's looking at all that right now.
[00:03:43.438 --> 00:03:45.979]  And we're right where we need to be, but just barely.
[00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:47.800]  So again, give yourself the gift of freedom.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.120]  Give yourself the gift of liberty.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.241]  Give yourself the gift of keeping real independent.
[00:03:53.476 --> 00:03:54.337]  Free speech on the air.
[00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:15.137]  Ultimate fish oil, ultimate curl oil, highest grade, so good for your heart, body, mind.
[00:04:15.137 --> 00:04:20.500]  It's all there for 40 to 60% off with promo code 1776.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.284]  The lowest discount is 40% off with promo code 1776.
[00:04:25.284 --> 00:04:28.446]  The highest discount is 60% with promo code 1776.
[00:04:28.446 --> 00:04:30.948]  And then you've got the double Patriot points.
[00:04:30.948 --> 00:04:32.749]  That's 10% off on your next order.
[00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:35.591]  And then you also get a free gift with every order.
[00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:36.952]  So I want to thank you all for tuning in.
[00:04:36.952 --> 00:04:38.673]  I want to thank you all for spreading the word.
[00:04:38.673 --> 00:04:40.895]  We've got some big interviews, as I just mentioned, coming up.
[00:04:41.475 --> 00:04:45.901]  Please continue to do your amazing part, your critical part, by sharing the live feeds and links.
[00:04:45.901 --> 00:04:51.808]  We're taking clips out of these very important interviews and sharing with everybody you know because you are the reason this operation is so powerful.
[00:04:51.808 --> 00:04:55.433]  And I salute and thank you all and I'm very thankful for you all this Thanksgiving.
[00:04:55.433 --> 00:04:56.154]  So God bless you all.
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:12.125]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:16.587]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[00:05:16.587 --> 00:05:20.569]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:24.051]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[00:05:24.051 --> 00:05:25.291]  You see, the sun
[00:05:26.792 --> 00:05:27.092]  We're good to
[00:05:50.672 --> 00:05:52.312]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:05:52.312 --> 00:05:53.013]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:20.043 --> 00:06:23.826]  Let me introduce to you a guest that really needs no introduction.
[00:06:23.826 --> 00:06:33.474]  My longtime friend, colleague, partner in crime, partner fighting all these terrorist sort of people that are out there, all of the cabal and the globalists, Alex Jones.
[00:06:33.474 --> 00:06:38.259]  I just can't even believe that Alex said he'd come and be on my podcast this morning.
[00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:44.524]  Alex, what a pleasure and an honor it is to welcome you to our podcast this week with Dr. T this morning.
[00:06:44.784 --> 00:06:57.170]  It's amazing, hard to believe I've been interviewing you for 22 years and now I'm here on your broadcast which I know is so successful reaching people and that's why you're one of the top two people that Big Pharma and the Deep State's attacking.
[00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.171]  It's you and Dr. Peter McCullough.
[00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:01.392]  They're specifically singling out everywhere
[00:07:01.932 --> 00:07:02.873]  We're good to go.
[00:07:23.851 --> 00:07:25.152]  Well, thank you very much, Alex.
[00:07:25.152 --> 00:07:34.757]  You know, I've done, between March of 2020 and December of 21, I did over 600 interviews, and usually I do about 30 a year.
[00:07:34.757 --> 00:07:46.484]  And people have always asked me when I've been on their interview, what does it feel like to be labeled as the disinformation dozen and to be called out by the person who calls himself president as one of the most dangerous people in America?
[00:07:46.484 --> 00:07:49.365]  I said, I kind of wear it like a little badge of courage over here, you know?
[00:07:49.365 --> 00:07:49.866]  I just do.
[00:07:52.091 --> 00:08:00.395]  So, I wanted to start out by asking you, because I read something that InfoWars published, I think yesterday or last night, about David Icke.
[00:08:00.395 --> 00:08:06.538]  I mean, he's another one amongst us that's been doing this for decades, and now he's been banned from the EU.
[00:08:06.538 --> 00:08:09.019]  And he's been labeled a Level 3 terrorist.
[00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:15.482]  And we talked a little before we went live about what a Level... Explain to the audience what Level 1 and Level 2 is and Level 3.
[00:08:15.482 --> 00:08:18.263]  And if he's a Level 3 terrorist, what does that make us?
[00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.052]  They would call us Level 3 as well.
[00:08:22.052 --> 00:08:28.698]  What they do is they take a real terrorist planning to blow something up, who's got a bomb or a gun, about to go do something, and they call that a Level 1.
[00:08:28.698 --> 00:08:30.219]  That's a real terrorist.
[00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:33.662]  And then you've got Level 2 as material support.
[00:08:33.662 --> 00:08:36.584]  And then a Level 3 is not a terrorist.
[00:08:36.584 --> 00:08:42.850]  They say, well, even though you're not even talking about terrorism or pushing violence, if you criticize the government or say there's a deep state,
[00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:50.434]  Or undermine the system in any way by saying it's wrong, trying to reprove it, trying to change it, you know, a basic part of living in a free society.
[00:08:50.434 --> 00:08:53.975]  Then we're going to call you a level three terrorist and restrict your movement.
[00:08:53.975 --> 00:08:55.236]  And it's the same all over the world.
[00:08:55.236 --> 00:08:58.017]  They're trying to bring in similar systems here in the U.S.
[00:08:58.017 --> 00:09:00.679]  And it's not just David Icke saying this.
[00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:08.563]  On Infowars.com, obviously, we have a transcript translated from the Dutch letter, but it's under EU authority.
[00:09:08.563 --> 00:09:12.785]  And in the Dutch letter, it says that he's banned for two years
[00:09:13.525 --> 00:09:15.507]  Because he speaks to crowds of 50 to 100,000.
[00:09:15.507 --> 00:09:16.908]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:09:16.908 --> 00:09:22.473]  has spoken to crowds of a million, and they're trying to ban him right now as well.
[00:09:22.473 --> 00:09:27.858]  By saying, you criticize the corporations, the power structure, so that's terrorism.
[00:09:27.858 --> 00:09:32.202]  So your free speech is now terrorism, which is really their endgame.
[00:09:32.202 --> 00:09:33.763]  And we saw in June of 2000,
[00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:36.270]  We're good to go.
[00:09:55.663 --> 00:10:11.608]  Criticizing lockdowns, forced injections, or open borders, and now it came out two weeks ago, the Intercept, more documents, or criticizing man-made global warming, saying it's not real, or even questioning, or questioning the
[00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:19.132]  Pull out a year ago out of Afghanistan that you're also a extremist and need to be censored.
[00:10:19.132 --> 00:10:27.559]  So they define you as a terrorist or a white supremacist for simply being a good citizen and being engaged and then say that you're the main terror threat.
[00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:29.241]  That is official U.S.
[00:10:29.241 --> 00:10:30.382]  government policy now.
[00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:36.181]  Alex, you know, we went to war in World War II over this sort of censorship.
[00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:43.087]  We set up Radio Free Europe after World War II, even though we know that that was a CIA PSYOP and all those other things.
[00:10:43.087 --> 00:10:51.154]  But ostensibly, I mean, on the surface, I mean, the thing was to try to get past what the propaganda message was, the over and over propaganda message was.
[00:10:51.795 --> 00:10:52.696]  And here we are.
[00:10:52.696 --> 00:10:55.657]  I mean, the United States of America, did you ever think?
[00:10:55.657 --> 00:11:00.020]  I mean, well, yes, you did, because InfoWars has been around for a long time.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:06.063]  And, you know, I said to you back at the beginning of this plandemic thing, I said, congratulations, Alex.
[00:11:06.063 --> 00:11:10.646]  I mean, you've been prophetic when you said InfoWars was what was happening.
[00:11:10.646 --> 00:11:19.611]  I mean, but it's one thing to talk about it, like in hushed circles amongst friends and colleagues that are of like mind.
[00:11:20.211 --> 00:11:23.753]  Now, it's so out in the open.
[00:11:23.753 --> 00:11:34.461]  We used to talk about things like adenochrome and human trafficking and pedophilia behind closed doors, only with friends and family that you knew were on the same page as you.
[00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:39.164]  But now it is so obvious with the depopulation agenda of what they're doing and going forward.
[00:11:40.464 --> 00:11:42.705]  What do you think is the next step?
[00:11:42.705 --> 00:11:50.727]  I mean, you've been prophetically talking about this for 30 years, you know, like I've been talking about vaccine issues for 22 years.
[00:11:50.727 --> 00:11:54.308]  Where do you think they are going to go next?
[00:11:54.308 --> 00:11:55.668]  Well, that's the most important question.
[00:11:55.668 --> 00:12:02.970]  And just to be clear, I was prophetically led by God and the Holy Spirit to look into these things.
[00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:08.552]  But really, when I began to read the books by Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, David Rockefeller,
[00:12:09.483 --> 00:12:12.284]  I knew this was all coming when I first got on air 28 years ago.
[00:12:12.284 --> 00:12:20.449]  I was really... to 33 years ago, even when I was in high school, but I've been on air 28 years since I was 21.
[00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:32.335]  I knew this was all coming because it was in the documents, but the reason I was interested in the documents is my mother's brother, who died a few years ago, best guy I ever knew,
[00:12:33.547 --> 00:12:37.629]  He'd been this big, you know, star, youngest ever ham radio operator.
[00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:42.612]  He won national awards for being the fastest Morse code operator.
[00:12:42.612 --> 00:12:45.193]  And he was a Vietnam war hero.
[00:12:45.193 --> 00:12:47.054]  But none of us ever knew that until he died.
[00:12:47.054 --> 00:12:48.995]  We knew he was in Vietnam.
[00:12:48.995 --> 00:12:58.080]  But then he was involved in Iran-Contra and involved in high level management of a lot of really big things.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.721]  And he saw some things in Guatemala.
[00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:01.850]  I don't
[00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:26.808]  He was in Army Special Operations and, you know, high level directly communicating with the White House because he was the guy that did the Morse code the fastest and, you know, all the rest of it.
[00:13:26.808 --> 00:13:28.510]  So he was in charge.
[00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:33.136]  And even back then, they still use Morse code because nobody can basically crack the special codes they use and things.
[00:13:33.136 --> 00:13:36.379]  They still use low tech on the submarines, a lot of things.
[00:13:36.379 --> 00:13:37.340]  That's that super secret.
[00:13:39.002 --> 00:13:52.748]  The point is, is that he told me when I was young, starting at about 13, when I would go down every summer from Dallas and visit them for a week or two to visit my cousins in San Antonio.
[00:13:52.748 --> 00:13:58.030]  He basically taught me how to cowlade the cabbage.
[00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.511]  And so I really understood a lot of things because of that.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:10.066]  My dad was also really big on history and things, so I would ask him about Zbigniew Brzezinski and the New World Order and things.
[00:14:10.066 --> 00:14:17.874]  And so that's really why I know that, was because of William Forrest Hammond, my uncle, is really the main reason we have Alex Jones today.
[00:14:19.062 --> 00:14:21.164]  And where do you think we're going to go next, Alex?
[00:14:21.164 --> 00:14:24.407]  And you know, it's interesting that you and I have sort of similar upbringings.
[00:14:24.407 --> 00:14:32.736]  My mom's younger brother was into studying all of the things about the Illuminati and about the Council on Four Relations and all of those things.
[00:14:32.736 --> 00:14:39.763]  So when I was a teenager, I remember sitting around the dining room table with my mom's younger brother and my mom and my dad talking about all these things.
[00:14:39.763 --> 00:14:41.645]  I must have been maybe in my teens.
[00:14:42.205 --> 00:14:52.171]  So, you know, as this whole thing unfolded, I've got a big library upstairs of much older books that I don't even think they're in print anymore, from listening to that growing up.
[00:14:52.171 --> 00:14:53.232]  So that's pretty interesting.
[00:14:53.232 --> 00:14:57.834]  We've gotten to this point kind of with that same growing up background.
[00:14:57.834 --> 00:14:58.855]  So here we are.
[00:14:59.595 --> 00:15:04.137]  And I, how do we, you know, everybody says, how do we stop them?
[00:15:04.137 --> 00:15:08.139]  I'm not sure how we stop them, other than just with more information.
[00:15:08.139 --> 00:15:10.580]  But because I think the train has left the tracks.
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:16.602]  I mean, when you looked at that Worldwide Forum website, what's their next move?
[00:15:16.602 --> 00:15:18.703]  What are they going to do next?
[00:15:18.703 --> 00:15:22.865]  I'm glad you went back to your actual question, because I kind of digressed into the first part of the second part.
[00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:25.342]  What you said is so key.
[00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:35.791]  Because of countless people going back to Barry Goldwater and the John Birch Society and all those folks that turned out were dead on, they were the ones that were really prophetic.
[00:15:35.791 --> 00:15:43.637]  We, a lot of people around the country, especially in the Midwest and just all over the nation, really were awake to what was going on.
[00:15:53.330 --> 00:16:02.072]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[00:16:02.072 --> 00:16:04.713]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[00:16:04.713 --> 00:16:10.334]  Now the news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[00:16:10.334 --> 00:16:14.835]  The bad news is by Christmas almost every product in the store will be sold out and
[00:16:14.855 --> 00:16:16.916]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[00:16:16.916 --> 00:16:21.357]  So now is the time to take action to support the InfoWar and get the biggest sales of the year.
[00:16:21.357 --> 00:16:27.299]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and BioTruth Selenium and our Wake Up America award-winning coffee.
[00:16:27.299 --> 00:16:31.481]  And now, DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Refusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:16:32.501 --> 00:16:38.322]  So many other great products like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Finish Oil, Vaz-O-Beats, Secret 12.
[00:16:38.322 --> 00:16:42.643]  They are all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[00:16:42.643 --> 00:16:45.224]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today.
[00:16:45.224 --> 00:16:49.605]  So every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:16:49.605 --> 00:16:56.307]  Promo code 1776 and you get an additional 10% off your already giant savings at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:57.607]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:16:57.607 --> 00:16:58.007]  God bless.
[00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:05.595]  Ladies and gentlemen, we always run the biggest deals of the year starting in mid-November through Christmas.
[00:17:05.595 --> 00:17:10.859]  But this year is hands down the biggest sale we've ever offered.
[00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:13.501]  Not just up to 60% off with Promo Code 1776.
[00:17:15.362 --> 00:17:21.188]  But on top of it, double Patriot points and what makes this the most special sale ever.
[00:17:21.188 --> 00:17:25.633]  Every order will get a free gift, no matter how small or how big.
[00:17:25.633 --> 00:17:30.018]  And it's all randomly selected by the shopping cart computer.
[00:17:30.018 --> 00:17:32.321]  So you might order a sticker pack for $5.
[00:17:32.321 --> 00:17:34.923]  You might order the blowout t-shirt sale for $4.95.
[00:17:36.445 --> 00:17:40.529]  And then get something worth $50, $60, $70, $80, $100.
[00:17:40.529 --> 00:17:43.291]  So again, some of the gifts are sticker packs.
[00:17:43.291 --> 00:17:45.073]  Some of them are Alex Jones Halloween masks.
[00:17:45.073 --> 00:17:49.357]  Some of them are books, films, InfoWars flags, American flags.
[00:17:49.357 --> 00:17:51.099]  There are hundreds of different items.
[00:17:51.099 --> 00:17:52.300]  It's all random.
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.821]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:53.821 --> 00:17:56.043]  Every order gets a free gift.
[00:17:56.043 --> 00:17:58.906]  Free gifts with every order at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:59.707 --> 00:18:02.190]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.471]  Why is this taking so long?
[00:18:03.471 --> 00:18:06.955]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[00:18:06.955 --> 00:18:08.217]  Why can't we do this here?
[00:18:08.217 --> 00:18:10.760]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:16.627]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[00:18:16.767 --> 00:18:18.607]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[00:18:18.607 --> 00:18:20.508]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[00:18:20.508 --> 00:18:22.428]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[00:18:22.428 --> 00:18:33.011]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[00:18:33.011 --> 00:18:37.152]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[00:18:37.152 --> 00:18:40.053]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[00:18:40.053 --> 00:18:42.073]  Communications are the reason why we didn't win.
[00:18:42.073 --> 00:18:46.156]  Well, that's why Infowars.com is so damn important.
[00:18:46.156 --> 00:18:49.498]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[00:18:49.498 --> 00:18:51.719]  People need to get behind Infowars.
[00:18:51.719 --> 00:18:57.002]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[00:18:57.002 --> 00:18:59.484]  We need more of this communications, not less.
[00:18:59.844 --> 00:19:03.206]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[00:19:03.206 --> 00:19:06.028]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[00:19:06.028 --> 00:19:08.730]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.030]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.953]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[00:19:13.953 --> 00:19:18.836]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:25.299]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[00:19:25.299 --> 00:19:33.944]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[00:19:33.944 --> 00:19:39.627]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[00:19:39.627 --> 00:19:45.050]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.772]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[00:19:47.772 --> 00:19:50.453]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[00:19:50.453 --> 00:19:51.934]  So go check out the store.
[00:19:51.934 --> 00:19:53.135]  Go support their store.
[00:19:53.135 --> 00:19:54.636]  Go support InfoWars.
[00:19:54.636 --> 00:19:55.997]  Leave a donation right now.
[00:19:55.997 --> 00:20:00.400]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.983]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:04.983 --> 00:20:06.284]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:21.269 --> 00:20:25.331]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[00:20:25.331 --> 00:20:30.354]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:35.637]  A lot of people around the country, especially in the Midwest and just all over the nation, really were awake.
[00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:50.647]  To what was going on in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, back when it was just embryonic, because there were a lot of people in the system that were being inducted into this tyranny who didn't like it, who were whistleblowers, and who came out and exposed it.
[00:20:50.647 --> 00:20:58.349]  So everything we're seeing today is what they said was coming because they were attempting to basically set up the programs for it back then.
[00:20:58.349 --> 00:21:02.511]  So a lot of those internal folks in government and corporations and the medical system and
[00:21:04.278 --> 00:21:13.535]  The clergy in the educational system held it back for decades and decades and so now because there was such a
[00:21:15.166 --> 00:21:22.051]  Backstop against it of people working for 60, 70 years quietly, or as loud as they could, but being suppressed.
[00:21:22.051 --> 00:21:27.695]  It was still pretty quiet, as you said, you whispered here and there, pamphlets, books, a few films here and there.
[00:21:27.695 --> 00:21:30.296]  We weren't caught completely flat-footed.
[00:21:30.296 --> 00:21:36.921]  And so in the last five years, the globalists have gone from denying all their programs to taking the mask off now.
[00:21:37.481 --> 00:21:37.982]  We're good to go.
[00:21:53.945 --> 00:21:55.927]  Where you would have emergence.
[00:21:55.927 --> 00:22:04.473]  I mean, even if you're gonna have a, say, an army sneak attack a position, okay, they sneak up, they get in position, but there finally comes the point of the attack.
[00:22:04.473 --> 00:22:09.797]  And so we're now gone from the beta testing into their operational system.
[00:22:09.797 --> 00:22:11.098]  So what comes next is
[00:22:12.372 --> 00:22:15.797]  More bioweapon releases from labs, which we now know COVID was.
[00:22:15.797 --> 00:22:29.916]  They're now creating the backstory of, at Boston University, humanized mice that again, as you know, as a doctor, act just like humans, basically the same death rate would be in humans, they estimate, of 80%, a super gain-of-function weapon.
[00:22:30.376 --> 00:22:34.921]  They now developed similar systems in London, broke last week as well.
[00:22:34.921 --> 00:22:47.496]  So they're even letting us know where the weapons are, that they've indeed made them, and they've got a gun to our collective heads, trying to hold us hostage, threatening to basically release these if we don't accept their New World Order.
[00:22:47.496 --> 00:22:50.940]  And so the whole COVID rollout was the segue from baited operational
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:56.824]  With the FEMA camps being built here, the COVID centers around the world, all UN policy directed.
[00:22:56.824 --> 00:23:01.828]  The policies created by the WEF itself is just a spokesperson group of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:23:01.828 --> 00:23:06.732]  Klaus Schwab has been on their steering committee since the 70s, except the WEF in the 80s.
[00:23:06.732 --> 00:23:09.074]  WEF emerged in the 90s.
[00:23:09.074 --> 00:23:15.038]  And as a forward-facing PR firm of global governance, corporate, fascist control,
[00:23:16.129 --> 00:23:16.409]  All right.
[00:23:32.336 --> 00:23:54.295]  More viral releases, more attempts at lockdowns, more attempts at forced injections, and testing with these injections, progressively getting more toxic, more poisonous, more dangerous, to see if they can manage the maiming and killing of us as the ambient background noise of the soft kill weapons are turned up.
[00:23:54.295 --> 00:23:56.357]  That's why it's so beautiful what you
[00:23:57.057 --> 00:24:09.085]  And countless others, but you at the tip of the spear, with just a few other top people, have done mobilizing against it, is they're asking, as you know, in Atlantic Monthly two weeks ago, which is the globalist mouthpiece, for an amnesty.
[00:24:09.085 --> 00:24:21.654]  Oh, we're sorry about lockdowns, we're sorry about masks, we're sorry about the shot not working, as they still try to push it on school children, as they try to make it, quote, federally recommended, so they can then bully people and claim it's mandatory through that fraud, as you know.
[00:24:22.554 --> 00:24:31.799]  And so they now want us to forget about what they just did the last three years so that we have that collective amnesia so they can do it again on a much more deadly scale.
[00:24:31.799 --> 00:24:40.925]  What we've been through in the last three years is a drill for martial law lockdowns when they release the really deadly bioweapons with a cocktail of other things.
[00:24:40.925 --> 00:24:42.946]  They can hit a city with a chemical weapon.
[00:24:43.997 --> 00:24:44.337]  I don't
[00:25:05.293 --> 00:25:18.083]  And in it, the Marine Corps was trading with the Army with drone helicopters to have helicopters go around and spray opiates on cities and, quote, make everybody pass out so the government could bring in martial law.
[00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:26.709]  They estimated that over 10% of the public would actually die in accidents, fires, and car wrecks when they did spray the cities with the chemical weapons.
[00:25:26.709 --> 00:25:30.672]  So we have real things like that actually on the books.
[00:25:30.672 --> 00:25:32.533]  The shadow government is not our friend.
[00:25:32.533 --> 00:25:34.395]  As Dr. Peter McCullough wrote a big article two days ago,
[00:25:34.995 --> 00:25:36.596]  I just interviewed him yesterday for two hours.
[00:25:36.596 --> 00:25:37.037]  That's it.
[00:25:37.037 --> 00:25:38.618]  Banned on video.
[00:25:38.618 --> 00:25:40.760]  And he comes out now.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:46.144]  He knew this two years ago when he first came on my show, but said he wasn't ready to go public yet like you had done.
[00:25:46.144 --> 00:25:47.625]  He took the gloves off and said no.
[00:25:47.625 --> 00:25:51.488]  A shadow global government is in control of the Pentagon.
[00:25:51.488 --> 00:25:56.452]  The Pentagon has run the rollout of the shots through the UN, through Pfizer, through Moderna, through Bill Gates.
[00:25:57.132 --> 00:26:01.534]  Uh, and is actually attacking its own people and attacking our troops particularly.
[00:26:01.534 --> 00:26:13.060]  So it's not our military per se, but it's the military complex that Eisenhower warned of that is actually directly working for the central banks that is carrying all this out.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.021]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:26:15.021 --> 00:26:18.324]  There's two things that you said in there that I want to circle back to and ask you about.
[00:26:18.324 --> 00:26:27.992]  I mean, one is when you said that this was a kind of a warm-up round for what they have next, which I've kind of said the same thing in a lot of my interviews and podcasts.
[00:26:29.933 --> 00:26:40.796]  I had been told by somebody early on, like this would have been in 2020, that this and the first article that I wrote in March 2020 after this stuff rolled out was same playbook, different virus.
[00:26:40.796 --> 00:26:43.417]  That was the first article that I wrote.
[00:26:43.417 --> 00:26:57.441]  And I had been told that, you know, that they thought the WF creatures, I call them, thought that this was just another trial balloon to see where they were on that continuum along that plan that they had, because they had SARS,
[00:26:57.921 --> 00:27:06.026]  Then they had MERS, then they had bird flu in 2005, they had H1N1 in 2009, and this was just another toss it out there and see where we are.
[00:27:06.026 --> 00:27:12.650]  And that the reason that they went full court press was because the Americans rolled over.
[00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:21.096]  That Americans just put on a mask, closed their businesses, cowered down and feared in their corner, and that the Americans didn't say,
[00:27:21.796 --> 00:27:23.218]  No way!
[00:27:23.218 --> 00:27:34.028]  And I just was talking, I was at one of Clay Clarke's events two weeks ago and I talked to somebody who had spent the last five months in Europe talking to pretty high-level people throughout the EU.
[00:27:34.028 --> 00:27:43.718]  And she said every single country that she went to and talked to high-level officiants, she said the first thing out of their mouth was, where the hell are the Americans?
[00:27:44.517 --> 00:27:45.718]  You know, why?
[00:27:45.718 --> 00:27:46.898]  Where are we?
[00:27:46.898 --> 00:27:47.879]  And you know it, Alex.
[00:27:47.879 --> 00:27:48.499]  You know it's true.
[00:27:48.499 --> 00:27:49.820]  I mean, everybody hears it.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.620]  They go, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.622]  I think part of it is because there's not enough pain here yet.
[00:27:54.622 --> 00:27:57.743]  They tried to induce pain with the increase of gas prices.
[00:27:57.743 --> 00:27:59.724]  You know, people still have food.
[00:27:59.724 --> 00:28:00.465]  They still have heat.
[00:28:00.465 --> 00:28:03.326]  They still have their businesses, whatever.
[00:28:03.326 --> 00:28:05.107]  Where do you think that is?
[00:28:05.107 --> 00:28:09.229]  Where the hell are the Americans in this battle?
[00:28:09.229 --> 00:28:12.351]  Well, I want to answer that, but going back to what you said about how this is a
[00:28:13.365 --> 00:28:14.586]  Same playbook, different virus.
[00:28:14.586 --> 00:28:24.194]  We know from Operation Lockstep 2011 and the tabletop exercises in 2019, Event 201, that they've been beta testing and drilling this.
[00:28:24.194 --> 00:28:29.157]  If you go back to a year and a half before they released the virus out of Wuhan and then the more deadly shot,
[00:28:29.938 --> 00:28:35.042]  Remember, uh, that they were saying all over the news, Disease X is coming.
[00:28:35.042 --> 00:28:38.924]  And when it comes, we're gonna have to lock down and take control to make you do all this.
[00:28:38.924 --> 00:28:44.388]  So that's how I was able to predict, you're not gonna be able to go to a ball game, you're gonna have to wear a mask, they're gonna lock you in your house.
[00:28:44.388 --> 00:28:46.150]  Well, I wasn't predicting it.
[00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:48.812]  They, they war game and battle plan this.
[00:28:48.812 --> 00:28:56.097]  And then if you look at SPARS, 2025-2028 war game from two years before they released the virus, what was it?
[00:28:56.097 --> 00:28:56.217]  It's 2018.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.702]  We've got some good news and bad news.
[00:29:01.702 --> 00:29:06.906]  InfoWars is running the biggest sale of 2022 right now on our amazing products.
[00:29:06.906 --> 00:29:12.450]  Your chance to empower your body, your health, your immune system, and more, and keep us on the air, a win-win.
[00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:20.977]  The bad news is a bunch of our best-selling products have already sold out, and because of supply chain breakdowns, it'll be months and months until these great products come back in.
[00:29:20.977 --> 00:29:22.318]  X3 sold out.

[00:29:59.457 --> 00:30:08.003]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[00:30:08.003 --> 00:30:17.629]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day.
[00:30:17.629 --> 00:30:18.730]  And that's the problem.
[00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:22.052]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[00:30:22.052 --> 00:30:24.814]  They illegally changed state elections.
[00:30:25.714 --> 00:30:31.256]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[00:30:31.256 --> 00:30:33.276]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[00:30:33.276 --> 00:30:37.537]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[00:30:37.537 --> 00:30:52.641]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question the fact that elections
[00:30:53.401 --> 00:30:55.503]  Um, shouldn't be run the way they are.
[00:30:55.503 --> 00:30:59.545]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[00:30:59.545 --> 00:31:11.573]  As an all-star fighter, businessman, motivational speaker, and philanthropist, Andrew Tate has truly earned the title of Top G. But there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has enraged the globalists.
[00:31:11.573 --> 00:31:16.997]  He is consecutively the most googled man in the world in the last two years.
[00:31:16.997 --> 00:31:21.600]  And that's because his message is about human, and specifically, male empowerment.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:28.327]  Now, Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.

[00:32:01.747 --> 00:32:03.968]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[00:32:03.968 --> 00:32:07.990]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.
[00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:09.310]  There's a solution.
[00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:10.291]  The Wellness Company.
[00:32:10.291 --> 00:32:13.592]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[00:32:13.592 --> 00:32:20.795]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[00:32:21.075 --> 00:32:47.137]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[00:32:48.132 --> 00:32:48.412]  We're good.
[00:33:15.157 --> 00:33:20.121]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:20.121 --> 00:33:22.003]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:22.003 --> 00:33:25.626]  Our love is unconditional.
[00:33:25.626 --> 00:33:28.028]  We knew it from the start.
[00:33:28.028 --> 00:33:32.251]  I see it in your eyes.
[00:33:32.251 --> 00:33:36.815]  You can feel it from my heart.
[00:33:36.815 --> 00:33:41.819]  From here on after, let's stay the way we are right now.
[00:33:43.376 --> 00:33:56.979]  If you look at SPARS, 2025-2028 war game from two years before they released the virus, I suppose from 2018.
[00:34:09.051 --> 00:34:28.567]  If you look at that multi-hundred page document, it even has example tweets of what they would put out, and it's really set in the year 2020-2023, and how they would roll it out, and how people would learn they were being poisoned, and the tweets are basically the exact same tweets, even the same acronyms, they just switch them around.
[00:34:28.567 --> 00:34:32.490]  And so they were using that as a battle plan for their whole scripted operation
[00:34:33.499 --> 00:34:35.000]  That way they get caught with it.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:35.981]  Oh, it's just a drill.
[00:34:35.981 --> 00:34:37.541]  It's just a tabletop exercise.
[00:34:37.541 --> 00:34:42.264]  They're not caught with their actual battle plan that's just set in 2020, 2023.
[00:34:42.264 --> 00:34:45.967]  But what was your other question?
[00:34:45.967 --> 00:34:48.688]  How do we get Americans more engaged in this?
[00:34:48.688 --> 00:34:52.731]  I mean, when we look at, I mean, we had the truckers going all across Canada.
[00:34:52.731 --> 00:35:00.015]  You know, we had when you look at the the farmers that happened in the Netherlands and what they did and they put manure all over everybody.
[00:35:00.015 --> 00:35:01.436]  I mean, we have huge
[00:35:01.556 --> 00:35:02.536]  I'll tell you how it happened.
[00:35:02.536 --> 00:35:03.817]  I'll tell you how it happened.
[00:35:03.817 --> 00:35:06.858]  The perfect PSYOP, and I'm not saying Trump's a bad person.
[00:35:06.858 --> 00:35:09.139]  It would take an hour to analyze why he did it.
[00:35:09.139 --> 00:35:20.404]  Just like he was for Regeneron, and just like he was for hydroxychloroquine, and just like he was for ivermectin, he just trusted the doctors and said, just legalize everything, accelerate everything.
[00:35:21.224 --> 00:35:30.006]  Which they acted like was his plan, but we know from a 2018 meeting that Fauci had on C-SPAN, they said, we want to blow up the old system.
[00:35:30.006 --> 00:35:31.767]  We want to bring in mRNA.
[00:35:31.767 --> 00:35:34.668]  We don't want a five-year or 10-year test.
[00:35:34.668 --> 00:35:39.089]  It'll probably be a virus out of China, something that's respiratory.
[00:35:39.089 --> 00:35:45.751]  They were telling people what they were doing at this big consortium meeting with DHS heads and CDC heads and others.
[00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:49.592]  And they were describing how they're going to use probably a respiratory virus out of China
[00:35:50.612 --> 00:36:07.965]  As the pretext to bring in this regime and about a week ago it broke that the National Security Council was under the CDC and others rolling out in 2000 a plan that had been created in the last decade before and what they believe perfected.
[00:36:07.965 --> 00:36:10.367]  So as you said they had this on the shelf.
[00:36:10.367 --> 00:36:11.508]  They were ready for this.
[00:36:11.508 --> 00:36:13.730]  It's on record they did.
[00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:17.413]  And so when Trump went along with the initial
[00:36:18.851 --> 00:36:19.391]  I think so.
[00:36:42.071 --> 00:36:43.233]  I mean, Trump wants to reopen.
[00:36:43.233 --> 00:36:44.115]  He wants to kill you.
[00:36:44.115 --> 00:36:50.026]  They became the party of pushing the whole agenda, which was always scripted as an alien dialectic.
[00:36:50.026 --> 00:36:52.331]  So Trump got Americans to stand down.
[00:36:53.547 --> 00:36:54.227]  I don't think so.
[00:37:13.298 --> 00:37:13.619]  I don't
[00:37:34.481 --> 00:37:35.102]  Very well stated, Alex.
[00:37:35.102 --> 00:37:35.962]  That's very, very well stated.
[00:37:35.962 --> 00:37:38.244]  Do you think Trump will ever denounce the shots?
[00:37:38.244 --> 00:37:38.484]  No.
[00:37:38.484 --> 00:37:44.129]  You know, his strength in going up against the globalists is that he's so pigheaded they couldn't make him do what they wanted.
[00:37:59.142 --> 00:38:03.806]  But then he will, and he does, go with his ego first.
[00:38:03.806 --> 00:38:23.443]  And so once he committed and saying the shot will help you and it's great and it's his greatest accomplishment, when his listeners boo him in Dallas and in Cleveland and in Florida, everywhere, when they boo him in Arizona, he quit promoting it.
[00:38:24.457 --> 00:38:32.128]  Instead, I'm not supposed to say the V word, but I'm still really proud of it and it's great and it works, even though the Democrats and the left admit now it doesn't work.
[00:38:32.128 --> 00:38:33.930]  In fact, it gets you more infected.
[00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.654]  And so, that's how Trump is.
[00:38:36.654 --> 00:38:38.256]  And I've gotten messages to Trump.
[00:38:38.256 --> 00:38:39.277]  I've gotten videos to Trump.
[00:38:39.938 --> 00:38:42.841]  I've got reports where I challenged him in the last three months to him.
[00:38:42.841 --> 00:38:47.827]  He called me, but he calls usually like one in the morning, so I've missed a few of his calls.
[00:38:47.827 --> 00:38:55.596]  And he told two people that met with him who brought him my ultimatum, my friendly two different ultimatums.
[00:38:55.596 --> 00:38:59.180]  One was like five minutes, one was about eight minutes, laying out the facts, showing him how
[00:39:00.382 --> 00:39:14.798]  They manipulated him showing him how he's going to get saddled with this and he can be a real hero like the Santas who got conned at first but you know it's now come out and said you shouldn't take the shot the Surgeon General and said it hurts children and it's all a big lie basically as long as he
[00:39:15.959 --> 00:39:34.346]  Stops them trying to force it on kids now and makes that an issue We will forgive him, but if he continues down this road, it's very very hard to support him And he said I don't want to hear about this again And I don't and and and I don't want to basically hear from Alex again Until he changes his mind.
[00:39:34.346 --> 00:39:40.969]  I'm right about this and I've confirmed that he now screams at Don jr
[00:39:42.606 --> 00:39:47.427]  He screams at, behind the scenes Trump has got a big temper.
[00:39:47.427 --> 00:39:51.848]  If you bring it up to him, he starts screaming and banging his fists on the table.
[00:39:51.848 --> 00:39:57.429]  And so he is pig-headed and totally committed to this because he doesn't want to admit he got conned.
[00:39:57.429 --> 00:39:59.349]  He doesn't want to admit he got manipulated.
[00:39:59.349 --> 00:40:03.950]  And that really is why people like Judge Henry Napolitano don't support Trump anymore.
[00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:10.391]  He means well, he's a good man, did a lot of great stuff, but he is somebody that will not admit when he's wrong.
[00:40:10.391 --> 00:40:11.231]  He just cannot do it.
[00:40:11.547 --> 00:40:21.911]  That's, you know, it reminds me of that expression that says it's easier to fool a man than it is to convince him that he's been fooled.
[00:40:21.911 --> 00:40:26.172]  You know, and it would be such a big person thing for him to say, you know what?
[00:40:26.172 --> 00:40:30.994]  I mean, Fauci himself and Birx have come out and Birx herself in her book.
[00:40:30.994 --> 00:40:32.914]  I mean, what talk about self-incriminating book?
[00:40:32.914 --> 00:40:37.616]  I mean, where's the DOJ just arresting her from her book saying, yeah, we lied to the president.
[00:40:37.616 --> 00:40:38.416]  We made it up.
[00:40:38.416 --> 00:40:40.137]  That's exactly what I told Trump.
[00:40:41.037 --> 00:40:44.840]  That's what I relayed to him in a letter and two videos that I got.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.281]  The first time he said, I don't want to hear about it anymore.
[00:40:46.281 --> 00:40:47.181]  The second time he blew up.
[00:40:47.181 --> 00:40:57.588]  I mean, I got, I've talked to well-known names that went in and showed him on an iPad these videos and he watched them at Mar-a-Lago and just blew up the second time.
[00:40:57.588 --> 00:40:58.628]  And what you said is so key.
[00:40:58.628 --> 00:41:03.231]  That's what I said to him in the videos that are also public videos, you know, emergency messages to Trump.
[00:41:03.231 --> 00:41:05.333]  I mean, there's several of them out there from a few months ago.
[00:41:06.488 --> 00:41:10.149]  Once for about four months ago, once for about three months ago, and I just kind of gave up at that point.
[00:41:10.149 --> 00:41:12.630]  Because he's still doing good, getting some good Republicans elected and things.
[00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:13.770]  So I'm not going to war with Trump.
[00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:14.750]  It's just very, very sad.
[00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:16.131]  But what you said is key.
[00:41:16.131 --> 00:41:19.672]  I said, sir, the head of the CDC has come out and said she was wrong.
[00:41:19.672 --> 00:41:20.932]  Fauci said he's wrong.
[00:41:20.932 --> 00:41:23.853]  They're getting ahead of it and rats leaving the sinking ship.
[00:41:23.853 --> 00:41:25.134]  Now they're asking for amnesty.
[00:41:25.134 --> 00:41:26.614]  I mean, that just happened.
[00:41:26.614 --> 00:41:28.275]  But see, he doesn't get it.
[00:41:28.275 --> 00:41:29.575]  And that's exactly what I told him.
[00:41:30.143 --> 00:41:42.480]  You know, he would be the forever generational hero if he came out and said, I listened to these people, they lied to me, and now that I know differently, here's what we need to do.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.583]  You know, and that would change everything.
[00:41:44.923 --> 00:41:47.005]  His greatest strength is his greatest weakness.
[00:41:47.005 --> 00:42:00.957]  When they threaten him to not get out of UNESCO, and they threaten him to not turn on pipelines, and they threaten him to not control the border, and they threaten him to not get rid of the tariffs keeping American jobs overseas.
[00:42:00.957 --> 00:42:03.179]  These are internal tariffs and scams.
[00:42:03.179 --> 00:42:03.980]  He's great there.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:07.023]  So it's his greatest strength and greatest weakness.
[00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:09.451]  Yeah.
[00:42:09.451 --> 00:42:12.873]  Sadly, with very powerful people, that's generally true.
[00:42:12.873 --> 00:42:17.796]  Speaking of powerful people, I want to go back to the World Economic Forum for a minute.
[00:42:17.796 --> 00:42:21.117]  Because there are a lot of people that, you know, we see on the front lines.
[00:42:21.117 --> 00:42:26.521]  Like, we see Fauci, we see, you know, Bill Gates, we see, you know, Klaus Schwab.
[00:42:26.521 --> 00:42:32.524]  And a lot of us, and I know you feel the same way, is like, they're just like the spokespersons.
[00:42:32.524 --> 00:42:35.106]  Who are the people behind the scenes pulling their strings?
[00:42:35.776 --> 00:42:39.761]  Do you have any insight into that from all of your connections?
[00:42:39.761 --> 00:42:40.142]  Yes.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:11.085]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[00:43:11.085 --> 00:43:15.547]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[00:43:15.547 --> 00:43:19.508]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[00:43:19.508 --> 00:43:23.950]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:25.011]  You see, the sun
[00:43:25.751 --> 00:43:26.051]  We're good to
[00:43:52.415 --> 00:44:11.521]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[00:44:11.521 --> 00:44:14.622]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it was
[00:44:15.282 --> 00:44:28.792]  It worked pretty good, and then shortly thereafter, you came out with F2, you know, with a deep root source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it, and man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to, like, literally, like, my brain was enlightened, you know?
[00:44:28.792 --> 00:44:38.058]  I could think again, I could connect with people again, and over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[00:44:38.058 --> 00:44:40.440]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.561]  The one I like recently
[00:44:41.581 --> 00:44:42.883]  Beautifully said, brother.
[00:44:42.883 --> 00:44:44.765]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[00:44:59.562 --> 00:45:02.946]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[00:45:02.946 --> 00:45:05.750]  Needs to support InfoWars and Vans.Video.
[00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:08.473]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[00:45:08.473 --> 00:45:09.735]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[00:45:09.735 --> 00:45:13.660]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:18.546]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[00:45:18.846 --> 00:45:25.010]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:33.736]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[00:45:33.736 --> 00:45:39.339]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[00:45:39.339 --> 00:45:44.763]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[00:45:45.003 --> 00:45:47.486]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[00:45:47.486 --> 00:45:50.169]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[00:45:50.169 --> 00:45:51.651]  So go check out the store.
[00:45:51.651 --> 00:45:52.852]  Go support their store.
[00:45:52.852 --> 00:45:54.354]  Go support InfoWars.
[00:45:54.354 --> 00:45:55.716]  Leave a donation right now.
[00:45:55.716 --> 00:45:57.217]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[00:45:59.594 --> 00:46:07.936]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[00:46:07.936 --> 00:46:17.578]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we, we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day.
[00:46:17.578 --> 00:46:19.239]  And that's the problem.
[00:46:19.239 --> 00:46:21.999]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[00:46:21.999 --> 00:46:24.780]  They illegally changed state elections.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:31.223]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[00:46:31.223 --> 00:46:33.244]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[00:46:33.244 --> 00:46:37.505]  We are in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[00:46:37.505 --> 00:46:52.612]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity, and question the fact that elections
[00:46:53.352 --> 00:46:55.453]  Um, shouldn't be run the way they are.
[00:46:55.453 --> 00:47:00.295]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[00:47:00.295 --> 00:47:06.198]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:16.768 --> 00:47:21.772]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:47:21.772 --> 00:47:32.359]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:32.359 --> 00:47:35.301]  Who are the people behind the scenes pulling their strings?
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:38.404]  Do you have any insight into that from all of your connections?
[00:47:38.404 --> 00:47:39.704]  Yes.
[00:47:39.704 --> 00:47:41.706]  First and foremost, this global government.
[00:47:42.947 --> 00:47:46.249]  Well, there's really three power groups.
[00:47:46.249 --> 00:47:48.971]  There's the Anglo-American establishment, nothing to do with being white.
[00:47:48.971 --> 00:47:51.293]  It's just what the British-U.S.
[00:47:51.293 --> 00:47:53.815]  combined empire calls itself.
[00:47:53.815 --> 00:47:57.878]  Others like Anglo-American oil, it was BP and all the rest of it.
[00:47:57.878 --> 00:48:00.240]  And so you got that major power block.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.741]  The British Empire merged the U.S.
[00:48:01.741 --> 00:48:04.342]  Empire after World War II.
[00:48:05.926 --> 00:48:06.206]  The U.S.
[00:48:06.206 --> 00:48:10.209]  became an empire after the Spanish-American War in 1898.
[00:48:10.209 --> 00:48:12.731]  For those who don't know, historians officially see it as that.
[00:48:12.731 --> 00:48:14.612]  So that's the dominant force.
[00:48:14.612 --> 00:48:25.080]  Then you've got the Russians that are a wild card, and you've got the Chinese that are allied or were allied with the Anglo-American establishment, but of their own predator group.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:30.804]  And when you talk about who really runs it, it really is the old royalty of Europe,
[00:48:31.926 --> 00:48:35.388]  That is one breed, and they're not even German.
[00:48:35.388 --> 00:48:50.879]  They're mainly Eastern European, Hungarian, Romanian, because that's the folks, starting like 800 years ago, that stopped the Muslims and controlled the trade coming out of the caravans into Europe.
[00:48:50.879 --> 00:48:52.360]  It's all the royal main lines.
[00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.950]  I'm getting too complex.
[00:49:11.536 --> 00:49:13.916]  Hapsburgs are all the same people.
[00:49:13.916 --> 00:49:16.037]  Bloodlines, and they're dominant.
[00:49:16.037 --> 00:49:18.257]  The Rothschilds got involved in that.
[00:49:18.257 --> 00:49:21.018]  The British Empire, they intermarried, are now lords.
[00:49:21.018 --> 00:49:23.438]  So they've actually merged into that.
[00:49:23.438 --> 00:49:26.999]  The Rockefellers and the Carnegies and the J.P.
[00:49:26.999 --> 00:49:36.701]  Morgans were just their front people here in the United States and setting up the whole Anglo-American merger and alliance that, by the way, not my opinion, he wrote three
[00:49:37.842 --> 00:49:38.582]  Books on it.
[00:49:38.582 --> 00:49:41.684]  Winston Churchill wrote The History of the English-Speaking Peoples.
[00:49:41.684 --> 00:49:42.784]  And it's all in there, by the way.
[00:49:42.784 --> 00:49:45.725]  None of this is even hidden at, you know, academic-level reading.
[00:49:45.725 --> 00:49:47.786]  I read all three of those books when I was in high school.
[00:49:47.786 --> 00:49:48.847]  They're incredible.
[00:49:48.847 --> 00:49:50.947]  In fact, I want to reread them if I have the time.
[00:49:50.947 --> 00:49:52.028]  Because it's all right there.
[00:49:52.028 --> 00:49:58.450]  Cecil Rhodes, by 1900, already had a plan for a world government and how they were going to merge the U.S.
[00:49:58.450 --> 00:49:59.631]  and British Empire.
[00:49:59.631 --> 00:50:02.412]  They set up the Council on Foreign Relations to do that in 1921 at Krauthaus in New York.
[00:50:04.813 --> 00:50:16.513]  And so yes, Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, people like Klaus Schwab, they're all just front people and so at the top it's these all
[00:50:17.967 --> 00:50:34.412]  Old, rich, powerful families who commissioned the British Royal Societies in the 1850s to learn how to take control of humanity and make humans a commodity, and then breed humans like animals, and create a caste system.
[00:50:34.412 --> 00:50:37.493]  This is all Galton, Wedgwood, Darwin.
[00:50:37.493 --> 00:50:38.374]  They were all hired for that.
[00:50:38.374 --> 00:50:42.175]  It's all on record in the Eugenics Society, in the founding of the modern eugenics movement.
[00:50:42.655 --> 00:50:50.101]  And they envisioned biometrics, computers, finding out the secrets of our cells, even before they called themselves.
[00:50:50.101 --> 00:50:53.323]  Their projects discovered DNA, everything.
[00:50:53.323 --> 00:50:57.806]  In the next 60, 70 years, they were able, with this giant project, to do that.
[00:50:57.806 --> 00:51:01.489]  And their main mission was figure out how to take control of all life on Earth, including humans.
[00:51:02.483 --> 00:51:05.146]  And learn how to discover immortality.
[00:51:05.146 --> 00:51:08.849]  That's obviously what the ultra-rich want, and how to basically become gods.
[00:51:08.849 --> 00:51:16.257]  And so out of the eugenic society that was embarrassed by Hitler in World War II, Hitler and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute were a spinoff of that.
[00:51:16.257 --> 00:51:21.882]  They then created the transhumanist society with Aldous Huxley's brother Julian Huxley.
[00:51:22.583 --> 00:51:41.252]  And then once they had done that, basically everything you see is a projection of that, how to get control of humanity, how to turn us basically into these bots that if they decide we survive, are basically programmable, so that the elites of the world that we hear, Noah, Yuval Harari,
[00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:47.614]  Revol Noah Harari talking about that the future is not human.
[00:51:47.614 --> 00:51:50.395]  That's a quote.
[00:51:50.395 --> 00:51:52.616]  By 2047, there'll be no more humans left.
[00:51:52.616 --> 00:51:53.616]  We'll all be cyborgs.
[00:51:53.616 --> 00:51:55.077]  This is them saying this.
[00:51:55.077 --> 00:51:57.317]  We're going to have a digital dictatorship.
[00:51:57.317 --> 00:52:05.880]  We don't believe in Jesus, or we don't believe in Muhammad, or we don't believe in God, is a quote of his, but we're going to be gods.
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:08.822]  And Microsoft and Apple are going to be God.
[00:52:08.822 --> 00:52:10.823]  The tiny elite are going to be God.
[00:52:10.823 --> 00:52:11.584]  And we won't be needed.
[00:52:11.584 --> 00:52:13.505]  They're going to get rid of the rest of us.
[00:52:13.505 --> 00:52:19.410]  And so, this is externalization of that transhumanist program that I exposed in the seminal film.
[00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:38.213]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement that can still be found if you search hard enough free online Back when Google video was still around in 2007 when we launched the film for free It had 80 plus million views when I got rid of Google video Then it had about 40 million views on my main YouTube channel.
[00:52:38.213 --> 00:52:41.916]  They took it down But but but you can still find some out there.
[00:52:41.916 --> 00:52:48.220]  Everybody's authorized to repost it and share it and do whatever you want with it but if you watch that film from
[00:52:49.421 --> 00:52:55.583]  I guess now 10, 17 years ago, hardly it's been that long.
[00:52:55.583 --> 00:52:56.983]  It's all basically come true.
[00:52:56.983 --> 00:53:02.105]  Well, that's because it was their battle plan that they were going from beta to operational right at that point.
[00:53:02.105 --> 00:53:05.006]  And so now they're accelerating into this operation.
[00:53:05.006 --> 00:53:17.850]  So to sum up your all-important question, in the final equation, it is an alliance of old powerful money that wants to live forever and become God, the Garden of Eden for real, and the promise of the serpent.
[00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:25.692]  Funding unlimited scientific research in every level there is.
[00:53:25.692 --> 00:53:45.299]  These groups actually financed what we know of as the whole genetic engineering arm, the computer arm, and the electromagnetic arm, and just this entire thing is a huge program that the Manhattan Project was only 1 100th out of my estimation.
[00:53:46.588 --> 00:53:51.050]  A giant secret scientific program for the elite to live forever and become God.
[00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:57.032]  And in the process, from the beginning, they said we first must follow Malthus and Plato's ideas.
[00:53:57.032 --> 00:53:59.513]  Plato, 2,300 years ago.
[00:53:59.513 --> 00:54:01.574]  Malthus, 300 years ago.
[00:54:01.574 --> 00:54:10.297]  Of exterminating the majority of the public as our survival of fitness, social Darwinistic toll.
[00:54:11.763 --> 00:54:20.391]  That it is their main tenet that we must first be cold to 500 million, bare minimum, before they can then transcend to the Godhead.
[00:54:21.869 --> 00:54:23.170]  Wow, yes.
[00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:24.331]  And I agree with all of that.
[00:54:24.331 --> 00:54:28.513]  And boy, that was a great way to lay that out in the history pattern, Alex.
[00:54:28.513 --> 00:54:33.977]  You know, this entire year, I spent this entire year on Genesis 6.
[00:54:33.977 --> 00:54:43.403]  You know, on Tuesday and Thursday night, I do an online Bible study called Happy Hour with Dr. T. And on Tuesday night, I invite authors and pastors and, you know, really people from that perspective.
[00:54:43.403 --> 00:54:47.006]  And we talk about God and we have an online Bible study on Tuesday and Thursday night.
[00:54:47.746 --> 00:55:04.832]  And this entire year has been about Genesis 6 and actually about Genesis 3 verse 15 where God cursed Satan and said, you and your seed, Satan and your seed will bruise his heel.
[00:55:04.832 --> 00:55:06.113]  His heel meaning Christ's heel.
[00:55:06.693 --> 00:55:11.058]  And you're the doctor, you're the scientist, but I think you're talking about mitochondrial DNA.
[00:55:11.058 --> 00:55:15.403]  No matter what they try to manipulate with our DNA, we still will carry forth the real DNA.
[00:55:29.738 --> 00:55:41.665]  Yes, except for the messenger RNA now is slicing up our DNA and the sulfide bonds that across our DNA spells the word Yahweh from the Hebrew alphabet.
[00:55:41.665 --> 00:55:47.068]  And the messenger RNA is going in and destroying that because they want to destroy God from the inside out.
[00:55:47.068 --> 00:55:52.271]  You know, when this first started in March of 2020, when I wrote that article, you know, same playbook, different virus.
[00:55:52.751 --> 00:55:55.713]  I also sort of looked up and I said, wow, we got to get busy here.
[00:55:55.713 --> 00:55:57.474]  This is Satan's last hurrah.
[00:55:57.474 --> 00:56:08.102]  You know, the Lord's coming back sooner than we think, just because he, you know, Jesus himself said, only the Father in heaven knows the day that I will come back, but you will know by the signs of the time.
[00:56:08.542 --> 00:56:28.775]  You will know as in the days of Noah where they bred humans and animals and genetic modification and like you mentioned the humanized mice and and the glow-in-the-dark pigs and all these different things that they're doing was what was happening as in the days of Noah when God came on earth and said whoa I made a mistake of this free will here I repent that I even
[00:56:29.435 --> 00:56:35.380]  Even created humans, we need to erase the plan and start over again.
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:39.783]  So all of that stuff that we're doing, this is all good versus evil.
[00:56:39.783 --> 00:56:44.527]  It is all, you know, we are fighting powers and principalities of this greater darkness.
[00:56:44.527 --> 00:56:46.008]  You know, it's not human against human.
[00:56:46.008 --> 00:56:51.252]  It's like the evil that's upon this planet that we've been fighting since the Garden of Eden actually.
[00:56:51.252 --> 00:56:56.576]  And we're coming up to that point of actually all these things are being exposed and it's becoming
[00:56:57.056 --> 00:57:01.739]  It's getting clearer and clearer that there's going to be less and less gray area to pick from.
[00:57:01.739 --> 00:57:02.999]  It's a black or white.
[00:57:02.999 --> 00:57:08.562]  Either you're on board with God and Jesus and you're on board with that or you're not.
[00:57:08.562 --> 00:57:14.325]  And it's almost like you've got your foot on, one foot on the deck and the other foot on the boat and the boat's kind of moving this way.
[00:57:14.325 --> 00:57:21.509]  And you've got to either get on the, stay safe over here on the dock, or you're going to get on the boat and go with God.
[00:57:21.509 --> 00:57:24.771]  Because if you fall in the middle, there's crocodiles in the middle are going to eat you alive.
[00:57:25.352 --> 00:57:32.889]  And notice, the devil always creates a counterfeit of what God says, and the devil loves to quote scripture, but the twist is...
[00:57:49.701 --> 00:57:51.942]  I've got some good news and bad news.
[00:57:51.942 --> 00:57:57.145]  InfoWars is running the biggest sale of 2022 right now on our amazing products.

[00:58:11.214 --> 00:58:12.574]  X3 sold out.
[00:58:12.574 --> 00:58:12.955]  Our great

[00:58:16.558 --> 00:58:18.300]  Biotricillinium has sold out.

[00:58:39.555 --> 00:58:42.116]  Don't do all your Christmas shopping in a month like a fool.
[00:58:42.116 --> 00:58:43.276]  Do it now.

[00:58:47.577 --> 00:58:49.738]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:49.738 --> 00:59:00.801]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[00:59:01.041 --> 00:59:02.943]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[00:59:02.943 --> 00:59:04.404]  That's what they want to take away.
[00:59:04.404 --> 00:59:05.945]  Your ability to speak freely.
[00:59:05.945 --> 00:59:07.667]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[00:59:07.667 --> 00:59:08.888]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[00:59:08.888 --> 00:59:10.729]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[00:59:10.729 --> 00:59:13.371]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years.
[00:59:13.371 --> 00:59:15.573]  And I knew they were planning all of this.
[00:59:15.573 --> 00:59:17.955]  And I warned the public, as a modern Paul Revere.
[00:59:17.955 --> 00:59:19.977]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[00:59:19.977 --> 00:59:26.923]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda.
[00:59:27.563 --> 00:59:32.946]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[00:59:32.946 --> 00:59:41.892]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsTore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[00:59:41.892 --> 00:59:48.176]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsTore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[00:59:52.651 --> 01:00:00.394]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:00.394 --> 01:00:15.419]  Uh, Yuval Harari came out two weeks ago and said, the elites are gonna get rid of humanity, we don't need you, and they're creating a Noah's Ark using all the science and systems for a breakaway civilization
[01:00:16.741 --> 01:00:24.289]  To go underground and off world and humanity is going to fall away like booster rockets as we go to heaven.
[01:00:24.289 --> 01:00:34.900]  And so again, we see Satan literally fulfilling prophecy, but telling his followers that they're actually going to be saved.
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:38.183]  How did a book written 2000 years ago or a book written 4000 years ago
[01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:41.791]  How is it all coming true?
[01:00:41.791 --> 01:00:42.691]  Because it's real.
[01:00:42.691 --> 01:00:49.615]  And if you go to the Sumerian text, at the same time the Jews are writing what they said, it's exactly the same thing.
[01:00:49.615 --> 01:01:08.666]  And it states it, and they know it, and mainline archaeologists say, well, that was the cosmology of the Sumerians, who are right there in the Euphrates area there, in what is Iraq today, where those rivers come together, where there's all that great farmland, where they found all those ancient civilizations.
[01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:16.296]  They say these entities came down and manipulated the genetics of humans and then everything got destroyed.
[01:01:16.296 --> 01:01:20.662]  So whatever people think it is, but the globalists know this.
[01:01:20.662 --> 01:01:24.348]  Like take the movie Prometheus, which is the prequel to Alien.
[01:01:25.408 --> 01:01:30.594]  And then I was reading where the director said, oh, this is what I really believe.
[01:01:30.594 --> 01:01:32.636]  And then that's what most of the globalists believe.
[01:01:32.636 --> 01:01:34.598]  They know evolution didn't happen.
[01:01:34.598 --> 01:01:43.008]  They know that you don't have a bunch of sand or a bunch of salt water and suddenly you get a cell that has billions of working parts.
[01:01:43.008 --> 01:01:44.029]  That's all just made up.
[01:01:44.669 --> 01:01:57.056]  And so they all know full well what's going on, and they've got a project to become God, just as the serpent said in the garden, eat of this apple, this knowledge, and you will then try to be God.
[01:01:57.056 --> 01:01:59.578]  And so I would call it the God project.
[01:01:59.578 --> 01:02:03.520]  They're trying to build this into themselves being God.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:07.402]  They're in a rebellion against God, but we are made in the image of God.
[01:02:08.428 --> 01:02:15.452]  Little G, when we follow God's plan, then there's a long-term program for communion with God, you know, as we go to the next level.
[01:02:15.452 --> 01:02:16.913]  That's a God's program.
[01:02:16.913 --> 01:02:20.315]  But Satan says, no, I've got a shortcut for you over here.
[01:02:20.315 --> 01:02:30.280]  But we do have to kill most of the people and have pedophilia and world government create all these abominations in the process, which are all affronts to God that are all meant to hurt God.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:33.382]  Because God loves us all more than we love our children.
[01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:34.802]  Because we are God's children.
[01:02:34.802 --> 01:02:37.284]  And so God gave us free will because God
[01:02:38.044 --> 01:02:38.905]  It's a great gift.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:22.946]  This is all there in the Bible, but again, in the last 200 years, I had some of the globalist proto-organizations go in and take control of the churches and basically dumb it down so that people aren't seeing how the Bible is literally an owner's manual, literally a survival manual, because I don't want to say God cheated.
[01:03:23.894 --> 01:03:28.939]  But God gave us free will, but also said, hey, don't play in the street.
[01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:30.160]  And this is how you should operate.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.201]  This is how you should work.
[01:03:31.201 --> 01:03:31.802]  And I'm here.
[01:03:31.802 --> 01:03:33.584]  And I'm here to hold your hand.
[01:03:33.584 --> 01:03:35.846]  And when the Holy Spirit comes, that's God trying to hold your hand.
[01:03:35.846 --> 01:03:41.712]  Now, if you pull away and don't want to have God direct you, then that's what God, God, God, God's very sad that happens.
[01:03:41.712 --> 01:03:43.193]  So that's really where we are.
[01:03:43.193 --> 01:03:44.535]  It is an owner's manual.
[01:03:44.835 --> 01:03:46.558]  God gave us ownership of the planet.
[01:03:46.558 --> 01:03:48.701]  You know, Satan's in control of it via fraud.
[01:03:48.701 --> 01:03:53.808]  If we just reach, you know, into our destiny and connect to God, we'll be given total dominion over the earth.
[01:03:53.808 --> 01:03:55.250]  Yes, the devil's gonna come.
[01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:56.712]  Yes, he's gonna have a short time.
[01:03:56.712 --> 01:04:00.657]  But it's the saints that are gonna battle this and create the fertile ground.
[01:04:01.318 --> 01:04:11.083]  For when he gets his limited one year, two years, or three years, depending on how you analyze it, of power, out of that comes the greatest revival ever, and then Satan's defeat.
[01:04:11.083 --> 01:04:22.208]  He's gonna act real friendly and real nice, and have cures to this, and cures to that, and signs and wonders, and then as soon as he doesn't get exactly what he wants, he's gonna get away with killing one-fourth of the planet.
[01:04:22.208 --> 01:04:22.749]  They want to kill 80%.
[01:04:23.849 --> 01:04:24.530]  Okay?
[01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:29.273]  So, so, and if God doesn't intervene, no flesh will be spared.
[01:04:29.273 --> 01:04:33.016]  You, in your lifetime, there's no doubt, we'll witness it, folks.
[01:04:33.016 --> 01:04:35.899]  But it's up to us to battle as hard as we can.
[01:04:35.899 --> 01:04:39.381]  At a certain point, Satan will overcome the saints for a very short period.
[01:04:39.381 --> 01:04:41.423]  So he's going to win an inning.
[01:04:41.423 --> 01:04:42.364]  Satan's going to win an inning.
[01:04:42.944 --> 01:04:44.447]  And a lot of us are going to get killed in the process.
[01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:45.729]  That's okay, we're eternal.
[01:04:45.729 --> 01:04:48.614]  We're going to win the brass ring, folks, okay?
[01:04:48.614 --> 01:04:51.619]  We're going to get the crown, we're going to throw it at God's feet, and I haven't won it.
[01:04:51.619 --> 01:04:54.584]  But I'm telling you, we're going to win the baseball game at the end.
[01:05:00.523 --> 01:05:02.665]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:05.327]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[01:05:05.327 --> 01:05:11.111]  Now, the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[01:05:11.111 --> 01:05:15.635]  The bad news is by Christmas, almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[01:05:15.635 --> 01:05:17.716]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[01:05:17.716 --> 01:05:22.180]  So now is the time to take action to support the InfoWar and get the biggest sales of the year.
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:27.764]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and BioTruth Selenium and our Wake Up America award winning coffee.
[01:05:27.864 --> 01:05:28.924]  We're good to go.
[01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:46.014]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today.
[01:05:46.014 --> 01:05:50.380]  So every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:57.090]  Promo code 1776 and you get an additional 10% off the already giant savings at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:57.090 --> 01:05:58.392]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:05:58.392 --> 01:05:58.813]  God bless.
[01:06:09.713 --> 01:06:13.816]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:06:13.816 --> 01:06:15.658]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:17.646 --> 01:06:18.687]  Well, hello everyone.

[01:06:44.446 --> 01:06:45.887]  We did one with Dr. Ryan Cole.
[01:06:46.287 --> 01:06:50.350]  I think we're going to have one more coming up before the end of the year for a Christmas holiday special.
[01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:52.572]  These are just for you, nobody else.
[01:06:52.572 --> 01:07:03.299]  And you also get special discount codes for our boot camps, for our webinars, for our products, on our supplement store and also on our t-shirt and apparel store.
[01:07:03.299 --> 01:07:05.421]  Which, you know, I really love our swag.
[01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:12.786]  I mean, to the point where, like, I get my own stuff and I use my own stuff and I have, like, a whole bunch of my own t-shirts that I wear up to the airport.
[01:07:13.186 --> 01:07:18.532]  And one that it says of the t-shirts that I wear at the airport it says faith over fear on the t-shirt.
[01:07:18.532 --> 01:07:24.760]  I always wear that when I go to the airport and I kind of I wear like a sweatsuit and I have that underneath.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.163]  I get so many comments and so people looking.
[01:07:27.163 --> 01:07:31.227]  It's like a way to like tell your faith to the world and encourage people.
[01:07:31.227 --> 01:07:32.929]  Faith over fear as we move forward.
[01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:41.153]  So, during our Deep Dive interviews, we have a personal conversation with our guests about what inspires them and find out a little bit more personally about who they really are.
[01:07:41.153 --> 01:07:53.479]  So, for today's Deep Dive guest, really needs no introduction and if you missed our This Week with Dr. T interview for Monday morning, you really need to go back and listen to it because, wow, we covered a lot of things.
[01:07:53.479 --> 01:07:58.401]  So, let me introduce to you my friend, my longtime colleague, Alex Jones.
[01:07:58.401 --> 01:08:02.883]  Born and raised in Texas, Alex Jones cuts through the lies of the globalist official narrative
[01:08:03.343 --> 01:08:13.590]  With unrivaled analysis that has simultaneously led him to becoming the most talked about, the most reviled, and the most censored name in broadcasting.
[01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:24.878]  Beginning with his first show in Austin, Texas in the 1990s, he's built a media empire with over 400 radio and cable television stations, hundreds of online streaming platforms, and international syndication.
[01:08:24.878 --> 01:08:31.503]  His new book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, Alex exposes the World Economic Forum's agenda.
[01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:49.186]  He has dedicated the last 30 years of his life to studying the Great Reset, and if you listen to our first interview, you know it goes even further back than that, way back into his childhood with family members that he talked about these things, and he's conducted tens of thousands of interviews with top-level scientists, politicians, military officials, and even me!
[01:08:49.907 --> 01:09:02.100]  In order to reverse engineer the secrets that help awaken America, Alex possesses three traits the globalists have worked tirelessly to stamp out of the masses in order to create permanent underclass.
[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:08.127]  Being well-read, having a really good memory, and caring about others.
[01:09:08.127 --> 01:09:09.828]  Alex, welcome to the Deep Dive with Dr. T.
[01:09:10.976 --> 01:09:11.976]  It's great to be here.
[01:09:11.976 --> 01:09:13.657]  Thank you so much over the years.
[01:09:13.657 --> 01:09:16.078]  Come on on my show and I'd love coming on yours.
[01:09:16.078 --> 01:09:17.138]  You're doing such a good job.
[01:09:17.138 --> 01:09:19.979]  That's why the system is coming after you so bad right now.
[01:09:19.979 --> 01:09:23.040]  So people should really, really be proud of the work you've done.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:23.980]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:26.001]  And yeah, they're like hot on my tail.
[01:09:27.121 --> 01:09:34.105]  And you know what, but it's sort of like, you know, I kind of look at it like, well, you know, it's what I'm here to do, and it's sort of like you.
[01:09:34.105 --> 01:09:38.447]  I mean, the system's been hot on your tail for the last, you know, year or two.
[01:09:38.447 --> 01:09:41.588]  The more successful you are fighting this evil, the more they come after you.
[01:09:41.588 --> 01:09:44.850]  So we know what we got into, and you know, God's watching.
[01:09:45.370 --> 01:09:46.451]  Absolutely.
[01:09:46.451 --> 01:09:57.498]  Well, with all of my Deep Dive guests, because this is an interview that we don't usually do very often, we don't really usually pull back the curtain and find out more about who these people are.
[01:09:57.498 --> 01:09:59.400]  Like, who is Alex Jones?
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.162]  So let's start with where you were born and what was your childhood kind of like?
[01:10:03.162 --> 01:10:06.685]  And when you went to college, how did you decide to go into broadcasting?
[01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:13.399]  Well, I mean, I could tell the whole story, it would take a long time, but just the basics is this.
[01:10:13.399 --> 01:10:17.243]  I was born in Dallas, and I grew up in a suburb outside Dallas, Rockwall.
[01:10:18.443 --> 01:10:30.015]  And I had my mom's brother that had worked in clandestine operations, was a really great guy, he died a few years ago, who basically educated me early on how the world worked.
[01:10:30.015 --> 01:10:33.338]  I had a lot of other family that was also very well read.
[01:10:33.338 --> 01:10:38.563]  I was a jock, but at the same time I, very early on, liked comic books and science fiction.
[01:10:39.721 --> 01:10:39.801]  Yeah.
[01:10:56.069 --> 01:10:56.309]  I don't know.
[01:11:14.986 --> 01:11:15.066]  It's
[01:11:35.865 --> 01:11:56.359]  It was all very anti-American, and then I went and sat in on some UT classes, because I was thinking about enrolling there, and it was even more anti-American, and I went and looked at their RTF operation, because I was thinking about getting into radio, television, film, because I wanted to talk about American freedom, because of the tyranny I saw in the colleges, and they were teaching stuff in RTF then that was 10 years behind.
[01:11:56.359 --> 01:12:02.824]  It wasn't anything about the internet, nothing about all these things I knew about, and so I thought, you know,
[01:12:04.475 --> 01:12:08.922]  I've got a job in sales, and I'm doing better than most people with college degrees.
[01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:17.876]  About 20 years old then, and then I began to watch AXS TV in Austin.
[01:12:17.876 --> 01:12:19.976]  That's where AXS TV actually began here.
[01:12:19.976 --> 01:12:23.497]  Had very nice studios, a lot of hosts, a big audience.
[01:12:23.497 --> 01:12:35.860]  And so I would see people on there playing G. Edward Griffin clips and Ted Gunnarson clips and talking about the New World Order and things like that and the massacre at Waco.
[01:12:37.222 --> 01:12:40.063]  And I knew these people were really smart and knew what they were talking about.
[01:12:40.063 --> 01:12:46.846]  So I went and visited my uncle in San Antonio, and I said, you know, I think I'm going to do an AXS TV show, and I think I'm going to fight the New World Order.
[01:12:46.846 --> 01:12:48.307]  He said, that's a great idea.
[01:12:48.307 --> 01:12:51.608]  So I started the AXS TV show, started going down there.
[01:12:51.608 --> 01:12:53.449]  There's only a few classes you have to take in late 94.
[01:12:54.509 --> 01:12:54.769]  We're good.
[01:13:11.141 --> 01:13:22.243]  And after about a year of that, a local radio station was switching over to talk radio from Rock and Roll, and the program director saw me and said, hey, would you like a Saturday night show?
[01:13:22.243 --> 01:13:24.444]  Come in this Saturday and do two hours live.
[01:13:24.444 --> 01:13:33.865]  Well, they just launched the talk radio, and they had Howard Sterns, George Liddy, a bunch of other big people, but they had a few local shows during the week that they launched that weren't getting any calls.
[01:13:33.865 --> 01:13:37.066]  Well, when I went on that first night, they had 10 phone lines.
[01:13:37.566 --> 01:13:39.368]  And I'd have to scream the calls myself during the break.
[01:13:39.368 --> 01:13:40.549]  You know, just get their name and write it down.
[01:13:40.549 --> 01:13:44.692]  They had a board op running things, but I was even taking my own calls.
[01:13:44.692 --> 01:13:48.695]  Because they wanted me to at least get their name instead of just punching them up like I did on AXS TV.
[01:13:48.695 --> 01:13:51.357]  Had calls as well, just you hit the buttons and people were there.
[01:13:51.357 --> 01:13:54.080]  Prank callers, regular callers, you name it.
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:14:01.005]  And so, there I was a year after being on AXS TV, hosting a Saturday night show that went from two hours to three hours.
[01:14:01.005 --> 01:14:03.367]  And then ratings came in in a few months and had high ratings.
[01:14:03.367 --> 01:14:04.608]  They gave me a Sunday night show too.
[01:14:05.854 --> 01:14:09.037]  About six months later, they gave me a weeknight show.
[01:14:09.037 --> 01:14:13.661]  It got higher ratings than Howard Stern and G. Orton Liddy.
[01:14:13.661 --> 01:14:14.501]  Wow.
[01:14:14.501 --> 01:14:16.123]  And the big lineup they had.
[01:14:16.123 --> 01:14:17.704]  And they said, well, she's not going to pay you, kid.
[01:14:17.704 --> 01:14:18.825]  I was doing it for free.
[01:14:18.825 --> 01:14:21.287]  I said, well, can I become a salesman?
[01:14:21.287 --> 01:14:27.452]  And so by the time I was 21, 22, I was already one of the top salesmen at a big talk radio station.
[01:14:27.452 --> 01:14:30.515]  And I was already, you know, making a couple hundred thousand dollars a year.
[01:14:31.764 --> 01:14:33.688]  And I thought, I want to make films.
[01:14:33.688 --> 01:14:36.014]  This is by 1996-97.
[01:14:36.014 --> 01:14:37.457]  I said, I want to show my listeners.
[01:14:37.457 --> 01:14:41.205]  Not just have a newsletter or a coffee mug or a t-shirt like most talk show hosts have.
[01:14:41.205 --> 01:14:42.167]  I said, I want
[01:14:43.226 --> 01:14:45.367]  To actually show people stuff.
[01:14:45.367 --> 01:14:54.553]  So on weekends, I'd fly places, shoot interviews, show things that were going on, the UN taking over the national parks, the signs they put up, things like that.
[01:14:54.553 --> 01:14:57.815]  And I made my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[01:14:57.815 --> 01:15:02.358]  It became an underground mega hit with people making copies of the VHS tapes.
[01:15:02.358 --> 01:15:06.201]  And I came out with DVDs, and I subsequently made more than 20 documentaries.
[01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:06.761]  But by 1998, I said,
[01:15:10.552 --> 01:15:11.494]  I want to be syndicated.
[01:15:26.397 --> 01:15:31.159]  Put myself on satellite, only like $4,000 a month, but would go to main receivers.
[01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:44.226]  And then I personally, um, then, uh, hired a PR firm, uh, when I was like 25, 26 years old, uh, to call 2,000 talk stations and send them a packet of information.
[01:15:59.258 --> 01:16:01.419]  We've got some good news and bad news.

[01:18:11.171 --> 01:18:16.594]  He is consecutively the most Googled man in the world in the last two years.
[01:18:16.594 --> 01:18:21.196]  And that's because his message is about human, and specifically, male empowerment.
[01:18:21.676 --> 01:18:27.921]  Now, Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.
[01:18:27.921 --> 01:18:30.883]  Introducing Top G Supplements.

[01:18:54.567 --> 01:18:59.416]  You're gonna have a whole bunch of people with no criminal record, dedicated athletes, who protect and provide for the people close to them.
[01:19:01.044 --> 01:19:21.677]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[01:19:22.177 --> 01:19:35.308]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[01:19:35.308 --> 01:19:44.155]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air.
[01:19:44.155 --> 01:19:50.520]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:52.101]  So continue to do it.
[01:19:52.101 --> 01:19:54.283]  Go to places like InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:54.283 --> 01:19:56.384]  Go to the places like Save InfoWars.
[01:19:56.384 --> 01:20:05.071]  Continue to keep InfoWars alive because in the process, you're leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:05.071 --> 01:20:06.372]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:20.283 --> 01:20:24.347]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[01:20:24.347 --> 01:20:28.531]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:38.039 --> 01:20:41.321]  2,000 talk stations and send them a packet of information.
[01:20:41.321 --> 01:21:04.576]  So the key was I spent the money I was making in sales and the money I made off the DVD and the VHS tapes that was then over a million dollars to hire a PR firm to send out packets to all the talk radio stations and I instantly in 1998 got over a hundred radio affiliates and was now doing this show out of a local station
[01:21:05.436 --> 01:21:06.997]  But suddenly it got national news.
[01:21:06.997 --> 01:21:08.539]  I got attacked some.
[01:21:08.539 --> 01:21:12.161]  The station fired me because they got political pressure.
[01:21:12.161 --> 01:21:15.644]  But I already figured that was coming, so I already built a studio in my house.
[01:21:15.644 --> 01:21:21.629]  And so by the year 2000, I had close to 200 radio affiliates out of a bedroom at my house.
[01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:22.950]  I was then married.
[01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:25.732]  My wife was pregnant with our first child.
[01:21:25.732 --> 01:21:26.172]  And so...
[01:21:27.293 --> 01:21:35.137]  I was not even 30 years old and it was on over 200 radio stations and I was on shortwave and a lot of other stuff.
[01:21:35.137 --> 01:21:41.921]  And so 9-11 came around and I really thought it was an inside job or the radical Muslims had help.
[01:21:41.921 --> 01:21:43.581]  We talked about the bombs in the buildings.
[01:21:43.581 --> 01:21:48.404]  So I went from hundreds of stations to about 40 stations in the space of a month.
[01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:49.504]  But I didn't back down.
[01:21:49.504 --> 01:21:51.786]  I didn't censor myself.
[01:21:51.786 --> 01:21:54.367]  And then that really exploded the show in the underground.
[01:21:55.088 --> 01:21:55.689]  We're good to go.
[01:22:07.412 --> 01:22:16.541]  And DVD sales, and tried to build a news media infrastructure, launched a nightly news program, hired another talk show host in the last 14 years.
[01:22:16.541 --> 01:22:25.589]  And then of course, social media exploded in the last decade, and we became the biggest show, even bigger than Joe Rogan is today, by about six years ago.
[01:22:25.589 --> 01:22:28.892]  So then they came in with the debanking, with the platforming to try to shut us down.
[01:22:28.892 --> 01:22:32.275]  We survived because we're on platforms like InfoWars.com,
[01:22:33.416 --> 01:22:34.717]  We're good to go.
[01:22:56.488 --> 01:23:03.850]  You know, some days I do six, eight hours of broadcasting, and sometimes it's a train wreck because it's teleprompter free, and I'm a wild man.
[01:23:03.850 --> 01:23:11.992]  But it's been a learning process, and every mistake I made, I would redo it now if I could, except it was a learning process that made me who I am today.
[01:23:11.992 --> 01:23:22.554]  So I could see God putting pressure on me, God teaching me, but only giving me what I could handle at the time, so that I would be ready and battle-hardened for the incredible stress and attacks that I've now entered,
[01:23:22.994 --> 01:23:23.334]  We're good.
[01:23:34.474 --> 01:23:58.850]  That's Mr. Vulcan, you know, there under the volcano into something that can now, isn't perfected, isn't perfect, isn't even that great, but has been through so many angles of attacks and been through so many globalist operations that now instead of a sword, InfoWars is more like a skeleton key that can open any door with our guests, our researchers, our callers, our ability to make things go viral.
[01:23:59.210 --> 01:24:02.055]  Our ability to stay afloat despite all the attacks.
[01:24:02.055 --> 01:24:04.339]  All of it was God's plan from the beginning.
[01:24:04.339 --> 01:24:05.441]  None of it was me.
[01:24:05.441 --> 01:24:06.123]  I was just willing.
[01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:11.643]  Wow, that's a great story on all different levels, Alex.
[01:24:11.643 --> 01:24:19.264]  I mean, such a great inspirational story of entrepreneurship that I think that people really need to hear stories like that, like yours.
[01:24:19.264 --> 01:24:27.626]  You know, that of how you just moved from one thing to another and you didn't give up and you took advantage of opportunities that were set in front of you.
[01:24:27.626 --> 01:24:29.006]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:24:29.006 --> 01:24:32.107]  I mean, God doesn't give us what we can handle.
[01:24:32.107 --> 01:24:34.287]  He helps us handle what we've been given.
[01:24:34.907 --> 01:24:37.408]  And I think that's a really important lesson.
[01:24:37.408 --> 01:24:38.469]  I'll say that again.
[01:24:38.469 --> 01:24:40.790]  God doesn't give us what we can handle.
[01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:43.811]  He helps us to handle what we've been given.
[01:24:43.811 --> 01:24:45.772]  When did your walk with the Lord start?
[01:24:48.168 --> 01:24:58.693]  You know, I mean, my parents, we went to church on Wednesday nights and Sundays, and my parents are, you know, serious Christians, but never really pushed it hard on me.
[01:24:58.693 --> 01:25:12.420]  And then I saw a lot of occultism and corruption in Dallas, and then my dad sold some dental offices he owned and moved to Austin, because that had always been the goal, because my mom's from Austin, and my parents met at UT, so they always wanted to get here.
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:16.022]  And once I got here, it was more new-agey and weird, and I
[01:25:18.135 --> 01:25:24.819]  I guess I fell away from God when I was in junior high and high school.
[01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:28.601]  Dallas, where I went to school, was pretty rough compared to the way things are today.
[01:25:28.601 --> 01:25:30.603]  People didn't shoot each other, they got in fights.
[01:25:30.603 --> 01:25:31.563]  So I was in a lot of fights.
[01:25:31.563 --> 01:25:34.985]  I wasn't a bully, contrary to what CNN has gone back and made up stories about.
[01:25:34.985 --> 01:25:37.227]  But I did get in a lot of fights and I did get proud of myself.
[01:25:37.907 --> 01:25:41.889]  So then, you know, everybody wants to fight together, you know, won all these fights or whatever.
[01:25:41.889 --> 01:25:46.111]  So I got in a lot of fights, got arrested a few times.
[01:25:46.111 --> 01:25:50.093]  And I never started the fights, but I got arrested, you know, for putting people in the hospital and stuff.
[01:25:50.093 --> 01:25:58.737]  And then I moved to Austin, and I had quite a few girlfriends.
[01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:10.935]  Because I finished up a couple years of high school in Austin, and my dad, when I was living at home, saw the bill in my room for an abortion.
[01:26:10.935 --> 01:26:14.977]  And he said to me, he said, you know, I don't want you to kill my grandchildren.
[01:26:14.977 --> 01:26:17.838]  He said, you really shouldn't do that.
[01:26:17.838 --> 01:26:20.039]  You ought to control yourself.
[01:26:20.039 --> 01:26:22.980]  And later in life, you're going to wish you hadn't been part of this.
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:26.502]  Because I'd paid for some abortions.
[01:26:26.502 --> 01:26:27.863]  But he just happened to see that bill.
[01:26:29.199 --> 01:26:37.928]  And he already knew because a girlfriend was around about a year before, and I guess she confided in my mother that she'd had an abortion.
[01:26:37.928 --> 01:26:45.196]  You know, they'd come and they didn't want to tell their parents or whatever, and they'd be like a 16, 17-year-old girl, and they'd go have an abortion.
[01:26:45.196 --> 01:26:49.019]  My dad said, you really need to stop killing my grandchildren.
[01:26:49.019 --> 01:26:51.782]  And I still kept doing what I was doing for a while.
[01:26:52.763 --> 01:27:00.945]  And then I really started having nightmares about it and really feeling a spirit of evil attacking me and that I had some important work I was going to do.
[01:27:00.945 --> 01:27:08.627]  It was the Holy Spirit and that God wasn't going to help me and that I wasn't going to be happy if I didn't, you know, stop doing what I was doing.
[01:27:08.627 --> 01:27:14.788]  And so for a few years, I stopped dating and was already working on stuff.
[01:27:14.788 --> 01:27:21.870]  I got really into shape, started exercising, started reading the Bible more, started watching C-SPAN, getting really into politics again and history.
[01:27:23.368 --> 01:27:29.851]  And I remember my mother walking in when I was like 18, about to move out to high school, and she goes, I haven't seen a girl here in about a year.
[01:27:29.851 --> 01:27:30.532]  Are you gay?
[01:27:30.532 --> 01:27:36.274]  It went from like all the beauty queens at the house, and I was really good looking back then, to like no women around.
[01:27:36.274 --> 01:27:37.455]  My mom goes, what the hell's going on?
[01:27:37.455 --> 01:27:40.156]  And so I moved out.
[01:27:42.077 --> 01:27:47.864]  I started dating some girls and, you know, kind of getting back into it, but then they'd get upset if you wouldn't go right to bed with them.
[01:27:47.864 --> 01:27:53.792]  And so for about a year and a half, I was pretty much celibate and just got back into politics.
[01:27:55.051 --> 01:27:59.454]  And then literally it was like the Holy Spirit was, you've got to fight the New World Order.
[01:27:59.454 --> 01:28:00.774]  You've got to engage these people.
[01:28:00.774 --> 01:28:02.896]  You've got to go challenge these people.
[01:28:02.896 --> 01:28:04.337]  You've got to do what your uncle talked about.
[01:28:04.337 --> 01:28:05.617]  You've got to resist them.
[01:28:05.617 --> 01:28:07.619]  And then in community college I was seeing it all.
[01:28:07.619 --> 01:28:11.601]  And so it was like there's this mission and you've got to do this and you've got to challenge these people.
[01:28:11.601 --> 01:28:15.023]  And so I was like 19 going to city council meetings.
[01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:16.364]  I haven't been able to find any video of it.
[01:28:16.864 --> 01:28:23.830]  And county commissioner meetings getting in their face about taking farmers land for environmental land grabs and them trying to pass gun control and things.
[01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:27.333]  So I was involved years before I got on air.
[01:28:27.333 --> 01:28:34.799]  And then again, I started the AXS TV show and about six months into it, right before I got the call to be on talk radio.
[01:28:36.007 --> 01:28:43.276]  I was sitting in a restaurant by myself at night, after I'd done like a two-hour show on AXS TV, with almost nobody in the restaurant.
[01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:51.447]  And I remember, I'm sitting there drinking iced tea and eating a chicken fried steak, and it was like the whole future opened up.
[01:28:59.068 --> 01:29:10.574]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[01:29:10.574 --> 01:29:15.017]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[01:29:15.017 --> 01:29:18.979]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[01:29:18.979 --> 01:29:23.421]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[01:29:23.421 --> 01:29:24.502]  You see, the sun
[01:29:25.222 --> 01:29:25.522]  We're good to
[01:29:52.896 --> 01:29:53.598]  Don't wait!
[01:29:53.598 --> 01:29:57.887]  Support the Infowar and your immune system with vitamin D3 gummies at InfowarStore.com
[01:29:58.919 --> 01:30:01.181]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[01:30:01.181 --> 01:30:03.843]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[01:30:03.843 --> 01:30:09.628]  Now, the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[01:30:09.628 --> 01:30:14.131]  The bad news is by Christmas, almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[01:30:14.131 --> 01:30:16.233]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[01:30:16.233 --> 01:30:20.697]  So now is the time to take action to support the InfoWar and get the biggest sales of the year.
[01:30:20.697 --> 01:30:26.622]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and BioTruth Selenium and our Wake Up America award winning coffee.
[01:30:26.622 --> 01:30:26.962]  And now,
[01:30:27.282 --> 01:30:41.925]  DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Refusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, so many other great products like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Vaz-O-Beats, Secret 12, they are all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[01:30:41.925 --> 01:30:48.886]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today, so every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out at mfullerworkstore.com.
[01:30:48.886 --> 01:30:55.247]  Promo code 1776 and you get an additional 10% off the already giant savings at mfullerworkstore.com.
[01:30:55.587 --> 01:30:56.887]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:30:56.887 --> 01:30:59.068]  God bless.
[01:30:59.068 --> 01:31:01.569]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[01:31:01.569 --> 01:31:02.849]  Why is this taking so long?
[01:31:02.849 --> 01:31:06.330]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[01:31:06.330 --> 01:31:07.650]  Why can't we do this here?
[01:31:07.650 --> 01:31:10.131]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:15.992]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[01:31:16.152 --> 01:31:17.973]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:19.894]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[01:31:19.894 --> 01:31:21.815]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[01:31:21.815 --> 01:31:32.399]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[01:31:32.399 --> 01:31:36.541]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[01:31:36.541 --> 01:31:39.442]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[01:31:39.442 --> 01:31:41.323]  Communications are the reason why we didn't
[01:31:41.403 --> 01:31:45.545]  Well, that's why Infowars.com is so damn important.
[01:31:45.545 --> 01:31:48.867]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[01:31:48.867 --> 01:31:51.108]  People need to get behind Infowars.
[01:31:51.108 --> 01:31:56.370]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[01:31:56.370 --> 01:31:59.352]  We need more of this communications, not less.
[01:31:59.352 --> 01:31:59.852]  Look at that.
[01:31:59.852 --> 01:32:02.593]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[01:32:02.593 --> 01:32:03.994]  That's because it's been denatured.
[01:32:03.994 --> 01:32:05.194]  It's been watered down.
[01:32:05.194 --> 01:32:05.915]  We didn't do that.
[01:32:07.616 --> 01:32:12.121]  You think I would metaphysically sell you something that is the very best I can get?
[01:32:12.121 --> 01:32:14.363]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[01:32:14.363 --> 01:32:23.391]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[01:32:23.391 --> 01:32:25.133]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[01:32:25.133 --> 01:32:26.914]  Don't you get the big secret?
[01:32:26.914 --> 01:32:29.457]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[01:32:29.457 --> 01:32:30.538]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[01:32:31.318 --> 01:32:37.103]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[01:32:37.103 --> 01:32:41.807]  Liquid consciousness.
[01:32:41.807 --> 01:32:43.308]  Look it up.
[01:32:43.308 --> 01:32:49.333]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[01:32:49.333 --> 01:32:54.657]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[01:32:54.657 --> 01:32:57.760]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in forestore.com.
[01:33:00.635 --> 01:33:05.257]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:05.257 --> 01:33:14.581]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:14.581 --> 01:33:20.244]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:20.244 --> 01:33:22.185]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.185 --> 01:33:24.766]  Our love is unconditional.
[01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:27.387]  We knew it from the start.
[01:33:29.468 --> 01:33:34.693]  I see it in your eyes You can feel it from my heart
[01:34:00.104 --> 01:34:24.410]  And it was like the whole future opened up and not the exact future but it was like a metaphysical moment where I was like at another level for about an hour in the back of this restaurant with sitting there and it was like you're gonna you're gonna take on the new world order it's gonna be huge you're absolutely you're gonna be the guy that triggers all these other leaders that are gonna come forward that are gonna be part of defeating this but
[01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:27.411]  You have to understand, you're going to get destroyed in the end.
[01:34:27.411 --> 01:34:29.192]  And it's going to be very painful.
[01:34:29.192 --> 01:34:30.252]  And it's going to not be fun.
[01:34:30.252 --> 01:34:33.133]  And I remember like, I've never been in the presence of something like that.
[01:34:33.133 --> 01:34:34.214]  I didn't see Christ.
[01:34:34.214 --> 01:34:35.114]  I didn't see an angel.
[01:34:35.114 --> 01:34:38.576]  I was like, like this down low, you know, that people like David Ike talk about.
[01:34:38.576 --> 01:34:43.058]  And I was just like, for like an hour and a half, like this, dinner, like in the restaurant going.
[01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:44.879]  What in the world is going on here?
[01:35:01.693 --> 01:35:03.695]  I was like, that was outside of me.
[01:35:03.695 --> 01:35:04.436]  This is real.
[01:35:04.436 --> 01:35:07.338]  And I was like commissioned at that point.
[01:35:07.338 --> 01:35:13.604]  And in that moment, it was like God was telling me, and you stop killing the kids and you're not going to do that now.
[01:35:13.604 --> 01:35:17.488]  And then right after that, I met my wife, started dating her, got her pregnant.
[01:35:17.488 --> 01:35:20.171]  We got married, had my son Rex, who's 20 years old now.
[01:35:21.071 --> 01:35:23.493]  Uh, are more than 20 now, time flies.
[01:35:23.493 --> 01:35:26.836]  And so that's basically my experience with God.
[01:35:26.836 --> 01:35:30.499]  But the being involved in the abortion, I didn't, I was lying to myself.
[01:35:30.499 --> 01:35:33.141]  It's not a human, it's just flesh, just a blob of tissue.
[01:35:33.141 --> 01:35:35.883]  I was convicted by the Holy Spirit about it.
[01:35:35.883 --> 01:35:38.545]  First convicted by my dad, then convicted by the Holy Spirit by it.
[01:35:38.545 --> 01:35:40.426]  And then I stopped the sin.
[01:35:40.426 --> 01:35:44.409]  And then literally that allowed the transmission and the connection to God.
[01:35:44.409 --> 01:35:47.772]  But that had to be removed because before that was happening, I was,
[01:35:49.036 --> 01:36:03.427]  I was, and I don't want to say depressed, but dark forces were pushing energy at me and trying to push me off what I was supposed to do, because the devil's not omnipresent, but the devil has foresight into the future.
[01:36:03.427 --> 01:36:16.657]  And so there was definitely an interdimensional spiritual whirlpool going on around me at that time, and I needed God to actually get out of that whirlpool, because you're either with God or with the devil.
[01:36:16.657 --> 01:36:18.258]  And so that's basically what happened.
[01:36:19.252 --> 01:36:23.433]  And since then, I'm assuming your walk with the Lord was actually with Jesus has gotten better?
[01:36:23.433 --> 01:36:26.954]  Yeah, I mean, I'll be completely honest.
[01:36:26.954 --> 01:36:28.234]  I mean, I go off and on.
[01:36:28.234 --> 01:36:29.375]  I have a problem with alcohol.
[01:36:29.375 --> 01:36:32.776]  I also have a problem, not with family so much, but with anger.
[01:36:32.776 --> 01:36:42.918]  And if I work too much and drink too much caffeine and stuff, I can, I wouldn't call them psychotic breaks, but I mean, I definitely can turn into a monster.
[01:36:42.918 --> 01:36:46.339]  And I've gotten really good in the last, you know, four or five years not doing it.
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:59.622]  But that's also my walk with God, is that I realized I would get mad that I couldn't meet the Globalist myself, and I believe in God, believe in Jesus, and had discernment in the Holy Spirit, but I was still trying to do it myself.
[01:36:59.622 --> 01:37:04.883]  And it's only been the last four or five years I learned to turn it loose, and not get so mad about what they're doing.
[01:37:04.883 --> 01:37:14.485]  I'm still mad about it, but go, it's up to God, it's God's plan, and I have to have some level of detachment, or when you stare into the abyss, as Nietzsche says, you become the abyss.
[01:37:14.485 --> 01:37:16.326]  So I have to, like, make sure that I don't
[01:37:17.170 --> 01:37:21.516]  Focus on the enemy too much or ever hate them because then that hate becomes you.
[01:37:21.516 --> 01:37:28.526]  I have to realize that they're fallen, they're garbage, they're evil and just protect the good people and just cut them off and not even think about them.
[01:37:29.295 --> 01:37:30.716]  Wow.
[01:37:30.716 --> 01:37:31.496]  Wow, Alex.
[01:37:31.496 --> 01:37:37.020]  Well, you know, you've been on this journey for a long time and you've got incredible research on your own.
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:42.504]  You've got a great research team and you've interviewed thousands of people.
[01:37:42.504 --> 01:37:48.488]  And you got introduced to this whole, you know, New World Order, this whole thing very early on.
[01:37:48.488 --> 01:37:50.009]  And in this entire journey,
[01:37:50.669 --> 01:37:55.772]  Has there been a couple of things along the way that have been really shocking or surprising to you?
[01:37:55.772 --> 01:38:01.414]  I mean, things that, you know, you kind of went, oh my, I never expected that.
[01:38:01.414 --> 01:38:14.301]  Yeah, I mean, I grew up, when I was like five, we moved from Dallas, like Central Dallas on White Rock Lake, to Rockwall.
[01:38:14.301 --> 01:38:18.282]  That was like a bedroom community then, but the richest county in Texas then.
[01:38:19.537 --> 01:38:23.000]  With a bunch of private airfields and helicopter fields and money.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:34.331]  And so it was a paradox of like, you know, it had the big, it had the black projects in it in downtown, the old town, and then it had all these rich people that lived out in the country and the hills around it.
[01:38:34.331 --> 01:38:36.674]  You know, it's a hilly area, kind of like Austin.
[01:38:36.674 --> 01:38:38.435]  Most of Dallas is flat.
[01:38:38.435 --> 01:38:40.277]  And it's on Lake Ray Hubbard.
[01:38:40.277 --> 01:38:43.180]  And I was shocked that
[01:38:44.639 --> 01:38:49.684]  That there was a lot of Satanism going on, and not just what you think of as like...
[01:38:50.643 --> 01:38:54.206]  You know, white trash in your backyard, sacrificing a dog on Halloween.
[01:38:54.206 --> 01:38:56.967]  I mean, real Luciferian type stuff.
[01:38:56.967 --> 01:39:05.393]  And I can tell some of those stories, but just to get you to know how weird my life's been, now that was God preparing me, that I never engaged in the Satanism itself.
[01:39:05.393 --> 01:39:07.975]  But I was, I lost my virginity when I was 12.
[01:39:07.975 --> 01:39:09.877]  I looked like I was 16 when I was 12.
[01:39:09.877 --> 01:39:11.978]  And when I was 16, I looked like I was 25.
[01:39:11.978 --> 01:39:13.679]  And so, you know, I'm 48 now.
[01:39:13.679 --> 01:39:19.944]  And so I, to like girls that were a little bit older, like 16 years old,
[01:39:20.604 --> 01:39:21.646]  Yeah, we're good.
[01:39:37.246 --> 01:39:38.047]  We're good to go.
[01:40:02.228 --> 01:40:02.648]  I don't know.
[01:40:24.025 --> 01:40:25.026]  You know what I mean?
[01:40:39.574 --> 01:40:42.296]  I mean, literally one of these houses was a castle.
[01:40:42.296 --> 01:40:47.640]  They had a castle out in the country with helicopter pads and an airfield and everything.
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:54.605]  And in come these rich parents and they're literally saying, hey, you know, we want you to join this cult.
[01:40:54.605 --> 01:40:56.966]  You like having sex with my daughter?
[01:40:56.966 --> 01:40:59.368]  So I got immediately like,
[01:41:00.006 --> 01:41:04.789]  They tried to put me immediately into one of the higher levels of these feeders.
[01:41:04.789 --> 01:41:10.273]  Most people get into the occult, they go join a satanic church, they're in it for years, and never make it into the inner rings of it.
[01:41:10.273 --> 01:41:15.817]  But I bypassed the stepping stones, they tried to put me right into it.
[01:41:15.817 --> 01:41:20.760]  And so again, my big challenge was, my big temptation was sex.
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:26.344]  And I'm saying once I transcended that, when I was about 19, that's when my main mission started.
[01:41:27.321 --> 01:41:40.111]  Wow, that's pretty shocking, at that early age, that you were not only able to not get involved with it, but to kind of walk away from it.
[01:41:40.111 --> 01:41:42.393]  Well, it was like a wall.
[01:41:42.393 --> 01:41:46.336]  At the point that that happened those times, there was like a wall.
[01:41:46.336 --> 01:41:52.140]  But because I didn't fully reject it, I was still demonically influenced.
[01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:53.161]  I mean, I did stuff.
[01:41:55.350 --> 01:42:11.160]  I mean, I'd beat people to the, you know, I mean, I would, like, people start fighting me, like, they were obviously attracted to me because I would, like, beat up full-grown men and stuff, and it was, it was not good, and it was definitely satanic, but the point is, I got out of it, I was never officially in it, but I was spiritually influenced by it.
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:16.483]  So let's just say this, I've been very blessed to be somebody that got on Satan's railroad for a while, but got off the train.
[01:42:16.483 --> 01:42:23.027]  But I now see back, that was all part of God's process, because if I didn't see all that early on, I wouldn't be ready for it now.
[01:42:24.178 --> 01:42:25.799]  Well, that's a true statement.
[01:42:25.799 --> 01:42:34.722]  I mean, you know, our whole life sort of, you know, we were both born for a time such as this and all of our previous experiences have kind of gotten us to this place.
[01:42:34.722 --> 01:42:39.004]  So as you move on to the end of your life, Alex, how do you want to be remembered?
[01:42:58.962 --> 01:43:07.507]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[01:43:07.507 --> 01:43:11.969]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously.
[01:43:11.969 --> 01:43:15.571]  It's election month, Alex.
[01:43:15.571 --> 01:43:17.132]  It's not election day.
[01:43:17.132 --> 01:43:18.813]  And that's the problem.
[01:43:18.813 --> 01:43:21.574]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[01:43:21.574 --> 01:43:24.336]  They illegally changed state elections.
[01:43:25.236 --> 01:43:30.779]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[01:43:30.779 --> 01:43:32.800]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:37.062]  We are in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[01:43:37.062 --> 01:43:52.169]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question the fact that elections
[01:43:53.331 --> 01:43:55.035]  Shouldn't be run the way they are.
[01:43:55.035 --> 01:43:56.418]  We're not election deniers.
[01:43:56.418 --> 01:43:57.761]  We're election realists.
[01:44:00.513 --> 01:44:05.397]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[01:44:05.397 --> 01:44:11.802]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[01:44:11.802 --> 01:44:16.926]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[01:44:16.926 --> 01:44:18.647]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[01:44:18.647 --> 01:44:25.052]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support an InfoWars are the real reason we've had this success.
[01:44:25.772 --> 01:44:31.214]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[01:44:31.214 --> 01:44:35.535]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[01:44:35.535 --> 01:44:44.718]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[01:44:44.718 --> 01:44:46.118]  God bless you all.
[01:44:46.118 --> 01:44:47.159]  I salute you.
[01:44:47.159 --> 01:44:48.159]  I thank you.
[01:44:48.159 --> 01:44:54.061]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[01:44:54.261 --> 01:44:55.601]  The fight is my fight.
[01:44:55.601 --> 01:44:56.242]  It's your fight.
[01:44:56.242 --> 01:44:56.982]  It's our fight.
[01:44:56.982 --> 01:44:59.563]  God bless you all.
[01:44:59.563 --> 01:45:06.504]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[01:45:06.504 --> 01:45:12.386]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[01:45:12.386 --> 01:45:18.728]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[01:45:19.068 --> 01:45:26.275]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[01:45:26.275 --> 01:45:36.586]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[01:45:36.986 --> 01:45:45.992]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[01:45:45.992 --> 01:45:52.577]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[01:45:52.577 --> 01:45:58.781]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[01:45:59.389 --> 01:46:01.631]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[01:46:01.631 --> 01:46:05.656]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[01:46:05.656 --> 01:46:06.977]  There's a solution.
[01:46:06.977 --> 01:46:07.958]  The Wellness Company.
[01:46:07.958 --> 01:46:11.262]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[01:46:11.262 --> 01:46:16.688]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[01:46:17.028 --> 01:46:18.728]  Doctors on demand.
[01:46:18.728 --> 01:46:44.773]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[01:46:45.874 --> 01:46:46.375]  I think so.
[01:47:20.566 --> 01:47:25.459]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:47:25.459 --> 01:47:26.943]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:32.501 --> 01:47:37.144]  So as you move on to the end of your life, Alex, how do you want to be remembered?
[01:47:37.144 --> 01:47:49.413]  I didn't used to care how I was remembered, but now I know how the globalists operate, like they've done with the whole, I won't even say the name of it, Connecticut stuff, where I barely ever covered the internet questioning it, literally 24 minutes in all those years before they sued me.
[01:47:49.413 --> 01:47:59.740]  Then six years after they sued me, they now admit a top PR firm that does the PR for the UN, out of New York, said we're going to run against Trump with Alex Jones the last two months.
[01:48:01.025 --> 01:48:08.053]  The 26th campaign or the 2016 campaign and we're going to build him up as this guy that did all.
[01:48:09.232 --> 01:48:09.392]  This is
[01:48:32.301 --> 01:48:41.019]  That they not be able to capture the Alex Joneses, the Sherry Tenpenny's, or the Tucker Carlson's of the world with the fake creature they create.
[01:48:41.019 --> 01:48:42.802]  Because they don't just create a straw man.
[01:48:43.675 --> 01:48:50.600]  They make that fake straw man who you are, and then don't just use that currently, they then use that to rewrite history in the future.
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:49:02.149]  That's why it's important to try to be as healthy as I can, to be on air as long as I can, show that as they're in live time trying to rewrite history that I'm this horrible person, people understand that it's bigger than me just saying, oh, Alex Jones was right.
[01:49:02.789 --> 01:49:25.629]  We're used to I would like just didn't even want to I don't want to be arrogant it's not about me because you make it about ego it actually weakens you but now I see myself as a symbol that I need to be better on air because I make mistakes and I need to be more steadfast because I'm an example but also they've made a false example once they de-platform you on all their platforms they can create whatever they want you to be and basically steal your identity.
[01:49:26.529 --> 01:49:29.952]  And so that's why how people remember is important.
[01:49:29.952 --> 01:49:47.604]  I want to be remembered as somebody that was pro-human, pro-God, pro-family, that stood up against evil, and that had a great effect, and to be an example to others in the future who are going to face their own trials and tribulations, to understand that Satan's in control of this planet, but God's in control of the universe that made you, and it's going to be the animating contest of liberty
[01:49:47.944 --> 01:49:48.084]  I don't
[01:50:11.732 --> 01:50:12.313]  We're good to go.
[01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:38.095]  But God has helped transform me 90% away from the point I was at.
[01:50:38.095 --> 01:50:42.340]  And so now overall, I don't even speed anymore in my car.
[01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:47.084]  And so it's all just a process of becoming better and better because we're an example to others.
[01:50:47.084 --> 01:50:48.346]  And it's not because we're Pharisees.
[01:50:48.346 --> 01:50:49.607]  It's not because we have all the answers.
[01:50:49.887 --> 01:50:51.668]  But it's because people see us as leaders.
[01:50:51.668 --> 01:50:52.648]  We need to live up to that.
[01:50:52.648 --> 01:51:03.474]  And people also have to understand that when they defend info wars, or defend free speech, or defend others under persecution, that that's what the enemy can't stand, because if they can pick off our leaders, they're going to win.
[01:51:03.474 --> 01:51:12.199]  So I just want to be remembered as somebody that really was a straight shooter, and really did tell the truth, and really did try to be as honest as I could.
[01:51:12.199 --> 01:51:17.261]  I've made mistakes, but I've never been this cunning, evil, manipulative mastermind they claim.
[01:51:17.261 --> 01:51:18.682]  They project who they are onto me.
[01:51:19.162 --> 01:51:22.791]  I've actually just been trying to tell the truth and swinging for the fences.
[01:51:22.791 --> 01:51:23.653]  That's really good.
[01:51:23.653 --> 01:51:26.239]  I forgot to ask you, do you have any siblings?
[01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:36.437]  My mother got sterilized by the Dalkon Shield IED when my dad was finishing up medical school.
[01:51:36.437 --> 01:51:37.578]  She wanted to have a bunch of kids.
[01:51:37.578 --> 01:51:41.260]  I only throw that out there because that's the system that they knew, by the way, to sterilize people.
[01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:43.382]  And she actually got a settlement from that, but she'd rather not have the money.
[01:51:43.382 --> 01:51:44.583]  She'd rather have more children.
[01:51:44.583 --> 01:51:50.688]  And so when I was 14, they adopted my sister from Korea, who was an orphan when she was about a year old.
[01:51:50.688 --> 01:51:53.270]  And she sees my sister, even though she's not blood.
[01:51:53.610 --> 01:51:54.391]  That's awesome.
[01:52:15.993 --> 01:52:21.516]  Psychologically colonized by the system, but I care about her and hope she does well.
[01:52:21.516 --> 01:52:30.261]  And I have three children that have lived with me since that divorce happened eight years ago, but two of them are moved out now.
[01:52:30.261 --> 01:52:38.045]  And then I have a five-year-old daughter with my great, wonderful wife, Erica, and so I've got four children.
[01:52:38.664 --> 01:52:40.507]  Oh wow, that's great.
[01:52:40.507 --> 01:52:47.578]  So that's, I mean, that's a big, that's a big span between, you know, what did you say is older, older than 20 and the five.
[01:52:47.578 --> 01:52:53.908]  So, you know, God bless you on both ends of your life, you know, with children, that's really a great, that's really, I mean, I look back.
[01:52:54.989 --> 01:53:00.992]  And on the children I killed, not knowing it, and I would, I just have nightmares about my children having problems now.
[01:53:00.992 --> 01:53:05.475]  I just, every time I see my daughter get in the car and drive off with my wife, I worry about traffic and wrecks.
[01:53:05.475 --> 01:53:09.217]  And I just, just literally my heart aches for my children loving them.
[01:53:09.217 --> 01:53:11.598]  And it's just, that's why they don't want you to ever have kids.
[01:53:11.598 --> 01:53:14.440]  So you would never imagine how precious they are.
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:18.583]  And the fact that I was lied to and deceived by the system, you know, to have paid for
[01:53:19.548 --> 01:53:21.629]  I don't know, six, seven abortions over the years.
[01:53:21.629 --> 01:53:26.012]  But people harden their hearts when they do that and say, I love it, I love abortion.
[01:53:26.012 --> 01:53:26.713]  No.
[01:53:26.713 --> 01:53:27.833]  Soften your heart.
[01:53:27.833 --> 01:53:29.634]  Know you made a mistake, you were lied to.
[01:53:29.634 --> 01:53:32.776]  Don't commit to it once you know it's murder.
[01:53:32.776 --> 01:53:36.199]  Then God, I really think, sees that as the ultimate sin.
[01:53:36.199 --> 01:53:38.240]  And that's why the left now says, of course it's a kid.
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:40.281]  Kill that little creature.
[01:53:40.281 --> 01:53:44.164]  They've really gone from it's a blob of tissue to, yeah, we kill kids, we love it.
[01:53:44.164 --> 01:53:45.525]  That's really their mainline statement.
[01:53:45.525 --> 01:53:46.105]  They wear shirts.
[01:53:46.485 --> 01:53:47.546]  How many abortions they've had?
[01:53:47.546 --> 01:53:51.790]  I think really abortion is the heart of the undermining of our country and our world.
[01:53:51.790 --> 01:53:57.475]  If we don't value our children, then God's not going to value us and we're cheapening human life.
[01:53:57.475 --> 01:54:01.239]  And so I think, you know, with me, abortion was the breaking point.
[01:54:01.759 --> 01:54:01.999]  Thank you.
[01:54:25.794 --> 01:54:31.876]  You know, I did an interview with the producer of a documentary called The Matter of Life.
[01:54:31.876 --> 01:54:36.838]  It's about abortion, but it's the best documentary.
[01:54:36.838 --> 01:54:39.699]  If you haven't seen it, Alex, I'd encourage you to engage in it.
[01:54:39.699 --> 01:54:42.920]  It's called The Matter of Life, is the name of the documentary.
[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:46.741]  And it's all done from a perspective of embryology.
[01:54:46.741 --> 01:54:53.203]  You know, that these two cells and these four cells are the same person as this 150-pound person sitting here.
[01:54:53.203 --> 01:54:54.244]  It's really, really good.
[01:54:54.244 --> 01:54:56.645]  I think it would make a good interview for you on your show.
[01:54:56.645 --> 01:54:57.665]  I'd love to have one.
[01:54:57.665 --> 01:54:58.705]  What's the name of it?
[01:54:58.705 --> 01:55:02.086]  It's called The Matter of Life is the name of the documentary.
[01:55:02.086 --> 01:55:05.568]  And Michelle can get you the name and the contact information of the producer.
[01:55:05.568 --> 01:55:07.788]  Well, just an elaboration on that.
[01:55:07.788 --> 01:55:08.228]  When a human
[01:55:10.949 --> 01:55:14.453]  And sperm come together, there's that big flash of energy.
[01:55:14.453 --> 01:55:17.756]  And you don't see that with most of the creatures out there.
[01:55:17.756 --> 01:55:24.623]  You see it with whales and other more advanced things, but the point is there's this huge flash of energy, you don't even know what it is, this pulse when they come together.
[01:55:24.623 --> 01:55:25.964]  I mean, that's real magic.
[01:55:25.964 --> 01:55:27.606]  I mean, that is what God created.
[01:55:28.576 --> 01:55:29.076]  Exactly.
[01:55:29.076 --> 01:55:31.817]  So it's like, you know, that's life.
[01:55:31.817 --> 01:55:37.079]  But Michelle can get you or your people the information because it's a wonderful documentary.
[01:55:37.079 --> 01:55:37.699]  I listen to it.
[01:55:37.699 --> 01:55:41.660]  I don't usually spend time to watch two hour documentaries.
[01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:42.820]  I just don't really have the time.
[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:47.662]  But in preparation for that interview, I watched the whole thing and it's really, really, really good.
[01:55:47.662 --> 01:55:49.622]  So Michelle can get your people that.
[01:55:49.622 --> 01:55:52.803]  So just as we're closing up here, there's two last questions I want to ask you.
[01:55:52.803 --> 01:55:57.645]  One is say something about your book, about why you wrote it and what
[01:55:58.345 --> 01:56:01.927]  You know, there's a lot of books out there about the New World Order and the Reset now.
[01:56:01.927 --> 01:56:05.968]  What made you decide you wanted to write this book?
[01:56:05.968 --> 01:56:17.834]  Well, I'd read some other books on the Great Reset that were excellent and I wanted to bring a bigger perspective to it and kind of the end game of what they were planning and how they're stealing free will in the whole future.
[01:56:17.834 --> 01:56:20.195]  Now it's bigger than just a global corporate takeover.
[01:56:20.195 --> 01:56:23.056]  So the Great Reset is literally the plans of the Death Star.
[01:56:24.562 --> 01:56:31.908]  And the proof of their criminal conspiracy against humanity and their own admissions that they want to be God and that they want to play God.
[01:56:31.908 --> 01:56:37.472]  And so I just hope people will go to Infowarsstore.com and get a unsigned copy.
[01:56:37.472 --> 01:56:41.795]  Or as a fundraiser, we're selling a signed copy because we need the funds to stay on air.
[01:56:41.795 --> 01:56:45.518]  We will stay on air despite all their attacks and all their fake judgments.
[01:56:45.518 --> 01:56:48.280]  This will all be overturned on appeal, but that'll take two years.
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:52.903]  So regardless, we'll be here for two more years if we have money for the appeals and those process.
[01:56:52.903 --> 01:56:53.724]  And we're just, you know,
[01:56:55.385 --> 01:56:59.566]  Right there in the edge of the black right now, so financial support for the viewers would be great.
[01:56:59.566 --> 01:57:04.968]  I hope people will get a copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World at infowarestore.com.
[01:57:04.968 --> 01:57:08.329]  That's one of the great books and films there on the site.
[01:57:08.329 --> 01:57:14.211]  And I know the listeners pretty much already know all this, but imagine your friends and family and neighbors getting a copy.
[01:57:14.211 --> 01:57:21.654]  Get it, read it, donate it to the library, and it'll be another seed that you put out there, another message in a bottle to the universe.
[01:57:22.134 --> 01:57:30.242]  And so, or try to take it to your library, your school library, that's got pedophilia in it, and watch the local AISD or local independent school district try to ban it.
[01:57:30.242 --> 01:57:35.967]  Well then do a report on that and use their own censorship against them and have the book blow up even more.
[01:57:35.967 --> 01:57:38.009]  So I want to thank everybody that has gotten the book.
[01:57:38.009 --> 01:57:41.733]  I want to encourage everybody else to get it at InfoWarshore.com.
[01:57:41.733 --> 01:57:44.816]  What words of advice would you like to leave our listeners with here today?
[01:57:49.258 --> 01:57:51.419]  Got some good news and bad news.
[01:57:51.419 --> 01:57:56.621]  InfoWars is running the biggest sale of 2022 right now on our amazing products.
[01:57:56.621 --> 01:58:02.164]  Your chance to empower your body, your health, your immune system, and more, and keep us on the air, a win-win.
[01:58:02.164 --> 01:58:10.688]  The bad news is a bunch of our best-selling products have already sold out, and because of supply chain breakdowns, it'll be months and months until these great products come back in.
[01:58:10.688 --> 01:58:12.029]  X3 sold out.
[01:58:12.029 --> 01:58:12.409]  Our great
[01:58:13.169 --> 01:58:16.011]  American Coffee Blend has sold out.
[01:58:16.011 --> 01:58:17.753]  Biotricillinium has sold out.
[01:58:17.753 --> 01:58:30.784]  But what hasn't sold out is DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Whole Food Multivitamin, Rain Force Ultra, Super Mel Vitality, and so much more.
[01:58:31.224 --> 01:58:36.770]  So, you've only got a few weeks to get these products at the lowest price you're ever going to find them.
[01:58:36.770 --> 01:58:37.771]  Don't fight the crowds.
[01:58:37.771 --> 01:58:39.033]  Don't fight the traffic.
[01:58:39.033 --> 01:58:41.595]  Don't do all your Christmas shopping in a month like a fool.
[01:58:41.595 --> 01:58:42.737]  Do it now.
[01:58:42.737 --> 01:58:43.637]  Get it all over with.
[01:58:43.637 --> 01:58:44.739]  Get a great deal.
[01:58:44.739 --> 01:58:47.061]  Keep InfoWars on the air while empowering your body.
[01:58:47.061 --> 01:58:48.383]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:49.474 --> 01:58:55.017]  Ladies and gentlemen, we always run the biggest deals of the year starting in mid-November through Christmas.
[01:58:55.017 --> 01:59:00.279]  But this year is hands down the biggest sale we've ever offered.
[01:59:00.279 --> 01:59:01.480]  Not just up to 60% off with Promo Code 1776.
[01:59:04.781 --> 01:59:10.606]  But on top of it, double patriot points and what makes this the most special sale ever.
[01:59:10.606 --> 01:59:15.049]  Every order will get a free gift, no matter how small or how big.
[01:59:15.049 --> 01:59:19.453]  And it's all randomly selected by the shopping cart computer.
[01:59:19.453 --> 01:59:21.715]  So you might order a sticker pack for $5.
[01:59:21.715 --> 01:59:27.639]  You might order the blowout t-shirt sale for $4.95 and then get something worth $50, $60, $70, $80, $100.
[01:59:29.961 --> 01:59:32.703]  So, again, some of the gifts are sticker-packed.
[01:59:32.703 --> 01:59:34.484]  Some of them are Alex Jones Halloween masks.
[01:59:34.484 --> 01:59:38.766]  Some of them are books, films, InfoWars flags, American flags.
[01:59:38.766 --> 01:59:40.527]  There are hundreds of different items.
[01:59:40.527 --> 01:59:41.708]  It's all random.
[01:59:41.708 --> 01:59:43.249]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:43.249 --> 01:59:45.450]  Every order gets a free gift.
[01:59:45.450 --> 01:59:52.434]  Free gifts with every order at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:52.434 --> 01:59:56.396]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:59.497 --> 02:00:03.022]  What words of advice would you like to leave our listeners with here today?
[02:00:03.022 --> 02:00:04.664]  Try to be as conscious as you can.
[02:00:04.664 --> 02:00:06.466]  Try to pray as much as you can.
[02:00:06.466 --> 02:00:13.275]  Try to really seek God's discernment and realize that
[02:00:14.622 --> 02:00:19.663]  You're not judged by how much money you have, you're not judged by what the world thinks of you, you're judged by what God sees.
[02:00:19.663 --> 02:00:28.745]  And that it's not fun to be persecuted in the flesh, but in the spirit it's actually the greatest high there is when you know they're coming after you because you're doing the right thing.
[02:00:28.745 --> 02:00:32.686]  So just keep your faith in God and get engaged now more than ever.
[02:00:32.686 --> 02:00:39.727]  Because the children are crying out to God to protect them, but God made us with free will, so God works through us to answer their prayers.
[02:00:39.727 --> 02:00:43.648]  And so we are, you know, on this earth, not like angels, but
[02:00:44.622 --> 02:00:53.830]  You know, we choose to serve God as God's instruments to go out imperfectly, but to go out and try to protect the innocent.
[02:00:53.830 --> 02:01:01.537]  And so, I do see it as, you know, once you're saved in Christ, the blood of Jesus, all is forgiven, but faith without works is dead.
[02:01:01.537 --> 02:01:09.404]  So yes, grace does it, but if you're really coming into Christ, then you're going to get stronger and stronger over time with Christ.
[02:01:09.904 --> 02:01:10.344]  Thank you.
[02:01:30.475 --> 02:01:37.480]  This is a process, and so if you don't step out and start doing this, the world's never going to get better.
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:45.126]  And so, I would encourage people to start their own podcast, or start their own letter to the editor, or call in to talk radio more.
[02:01:45.126 --> 02:01:47.188]  Just, you don't have to change the world overnight.
[02:01:48.069 --> 02:01:49.071]  Many hands make light work.
[02:01:49.071 --> 02:02:00.407]  Just do a little something up front, like I did calling you to talk radio and going to city council meetings when I was, you know, 19 years old, 18 years old, and just looking for ways to be heard.
[02:02:00.407 --> 02:02:02.470]  I mean, look at city council, county commissioners.
[02:02:03.596 --> 02:02:07.117]  School boards everywhere, every day, flood Twitter, Instagram, everywhere.
[02:02:07.117 --> 02:02:09.638]  Oh, okay, they can ban this person, they can't ban everybody.
[02:02:09.638 --> 02:02:16.620]  And then you'll see videos with hundreds of thousands, millions of views, dozens of them, where you can't even watch them every day, but everybody else is.
[02:02:16.620 --> 02:02:25.223]  And it's just moms and dads and brothers and sisters and grandmas and grandpas and teachers going to the grassroots power structure and saying, we're not buying it.
[02:02:25.223 --> 02:02:28.164]  And that totally scared the system, where they said, send the FBI after them.
[02:02:28.164 --> 02:02:29.885]  Well, then, of course, the FBI was discredited for that.
[02:02:31.685 --> 02:02:33.886]  Every venue you can to be heard, be heard.
[02:02:33.886 --> 02:02:38.468]  Every venue you can magnify Dr. Sherry Timpenny's information or my information, do it.
[02:02:38.468 --> 02:02:40.269]  That's great, and it's true.
[02:02:40.269 --> 02:02:48.573]  I mean, you know, they hire, literally hire, you know, troops of trolls to go out for their messages.
[02:02:48.573 --> 02:02:52.215]  And we have ten times more people, but you've got to volunteer your time.
[02:02:52.215 --> 02:02:58.758]  You know, I've said to people sometimes, you know, write down the five or six things that you're really interested in and pick one.
[02:02:59.298 --> 02:03:06.902]  Pick one and donate as much time and then decide how many hours per week of volunteer time that you can actually give.
[02:03:06.902 --> 02:03:08.102]  Is it five hours a week?
[02:03:08.102 --> 02:03:09.343]  Is it five hours a day?
[02:03:09.343 --> 02:03:12.785]  I mean whatever it is and then commit to it like it was a dental appointment.
[02:03:12.785 --> 02:03:17.427]  I mean you commit to it and really do because all of these all of our organizations need
[02:03:17.987 --> 02:03:19.609]  The boots on the ground.
[02:03:19.609 --> 02:03:24.695]  They all need people going out and folks are going to find folks are going to find it's not work.
[02:03:24.695 --> 02:03:26.036]  You'll get addicted to it.
[02:03:26.036 --> 02:03:29.580]  And there's so many organizations that are good, but they kind of plan all day.
[02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:31.362]  And you know, there's who's in charge of it.
[02:03:31.362 --> 02:03:33.224]  There's battles about the organization.
[02:03:33.224 --> 02:03:34.505]  Don't do that, folks.
[02:03:34.505 --> 02:03:35.406]  Just get out there.
[02:03:36.167 --> 02:03:39.492]  Just get out there and start speaking out.
[02:03:39.492 --> 02:03:42.496]  Put comments on things, support things.
[02:03:42.496 --> 02:03:46.281]  If you're going to buy something, buy it from Alex's store, buy it from our store.
[02:03:46.281 --> 02:03:51.689]  I mean, if you're going to buy it anyways, buy it from people that you want to support and don't support the beast by buying it from Amazon.
[02:03:52.009 --> 02:03:53.269]  Wars take money.
[02:03:53.269 --> 02:03:54.370]  Wars take money.
[02:03:54.370 --> 02:03:55.030]  Absolutely.
[02:03:55.030 --> 02:03:57.771]  And that's starting to happen, and that's what scares them.
[02:03:57.771 --> 02:03:59.372]  That's what scares them so much.
[02:03:59.372 --> 02:04:01.072]  Well, thank you so much for having me on.
[02:04:01.072 --> 02:04:01.912]  You're hard to get on.
[02:04:01.912 --> 02:04:03.093]  I know you're a busy person.
[02:04:03.093 --> 02:04:04.273]  You're prolific.
[02:04:04.273 --> 02:04:08.215]  And Dr. Sherry Tiffany, congratulations on being one of their top enemies.
[02:04:08.215 --> 02:04:09.035]  You're doing a lot of great work.
[02:04:09.155 --> 02:04:11.696]  And Alex, thank you so much.
[02:04:11.696 --> 02:04:12.896]  What you're doing is so great.
[02:04:12.896 --> 02:04:16.177]  And if there's anything else I can do to support you, please don't be afraid to ask.
[02:04:16.177 --> 02:04:19.738]  And I want to thank you so much for your really candid disclosure here, Alex.
[02:04:19.738 --> 02:04:25.040]  I know people learn things about you today that they never heard before and probably will never hear again.
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:29.421]  So I want to thank our premium podcast members that these are the sort of things that we bring to you.
[02:04:29.421 --> 02:04:35.983]  And so we close all of our podcasts, whether they're pre-recorded or whether they're broadcast live, with Romans 12.12.
[02:04:35.983 --> 02:04:37.403]  Rejoice in hope.
[02:04:37.403 --> 02:04:38.764]  Be patient with trouble.
[02:04:39.144 --> 02:04:40.586]  And be persistent in prayer.
[02:04:40.586 --> 02:04:44.651]  So until we meet again on our next broadcast, stay strong, stay in prayer, lean into God.
[02:04:44.651 --> 02:04:46.013]  He'll never let you down.
[02:04:46.013 --> 02:04:47.135]  Alex, we'll pray for you.
[02:04:47.135 --> 02:04:47.816]  We bless you.
[02:04:47.816 --> 02:04:50.299]  We thank you so much for everything you're doing.
[02:04:50.299 --> 02:04:53.823]  And thank you for never letting us down, my friend.
[02:04:53.823 --> 02:04:56.106]  Take care and have a great rest of your week.
[02:04:59.107 --> 02:05:00.908]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[02:05:00.908 --> 02:05:03.911]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[02:05:03.911 --> 02:05:09.695]  Now the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[02:05:09.695 --> 02:05:14.218]  The bad news is by Christmas almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[02:05:14.218 --> 02:05:16.300]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:18.862]  So now is the time to take action to support the InfoWar.
[02:05:19.202 --> 02:05:19.442]  I think so.
[02:05:42.008 --> 02:05:44.589]  Again, more stuff's going to sell out today.
[02:05:44.589 --> 02:05:48.970]  So every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:05:48.970 --> 02:05:55.672]  Promo code 1776, and you get an additional 10% off the already giant savings at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:05:55.672 --> 02:05:56.972]  Thank you so much for your support.
[02:05:56.972 --> 02:05:57.453]  God bless.
[02:05:57.453 --> 02:06:05.795]  Program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[02:06:07.395 --> 02:06:16.678]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread, and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum who are beholden to scum!
[02:06:16.678 --> 02:06:19.558]  Russian scum!
[02:06:19.558 --> 02:06:21.719]  Listen.
[02:06:21.719 --> 02:06:27.040]  Please, listen.
[02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:28.561]  If you don't, if you won't,
[02:06:29.599 --> 02:06:35.341]  If you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will striken you!
[02:06:35.341 --> 02:06:39.502]  The function of all life is survival.
[02:06:39.502 --> 02:06:39.662]  Sleep.
[02:06:39.662 --> 02:06:40.222]  Sleep.
[02:06:40.222 --> 02:06:41.283]  Sleep.
[02:06:41.283 --> 02:06:42.543]  Oh my God!
[02:06:42.543 --> 02:06:45.144]  Oh my God!
[02:06:45.144 --> 02:06:45.704]  Oh my God!
[02:06:45.704 --> 02:06:46.344]  Lock the door!
[02:06:46.344 --> 02:06:47.405]  Lock the door!
[02:06:47.405 --> 02:06:48.505]  They're coming!
[02:06:48.505 --> 02:06:49.665]  They're coming!
[02:06:49.665 --> 02:06:50.365]  Help!
[02:06:50.365 --> 02:06:51.086]  Help!
[02:06:51.086 --> 02:06:52.046]  They're coming!
[02:06:52.046 --> 02:06:52.766]  They're coming!
[02:06:52.766 --> 02:06:53.707]  Listen to me!
[02:06:53.707 --> 02:06:54.067]  Listen!
[02:06:54.067 --> 02:06:54.747]  They're coming!
[02:06:56.761 --> 02:06:57.362]  Please!
[02:06:57.362 --> 02:06:58.923]  Your legs are in danger!
[02:06:58.923 --> 02:06:59.824]  Please, listen to me!
[02:06:59.824 --> 02:07:00.985]  It's something terrible!
[02:07:00.985 --> 02:07:01.866]  Please!
[02:07:01.866 --> 02:07:03.287]  Your legs are in the air!
[02:07:03.287 --> 02:07:04.508]  They're already here!
[02:07:04.508 --> 02:07:05.089]  Help!
[02:07:05.089 --> 02:07:06.130]  Your legs!
[02:07:06.130 --> 02:07:06.710]  They're coming!
[02:07:06.710 --> 02:07:08.632]  They're coming!
[02:07:08.632 --> 02:07:09.513]  Sleep.
[02:07:09.513 --> 02:07:10.634]  The seed is planted.
[02:07:10.634 --> 02:07:12.576]  Sleep.
[02:07:12.576 --> 02:07:13.557]  Sleep.
[02:07:13.557 --> 02:07:14.758]  Terror grows.
[02:07:14.758 --> 02:07:17.000]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.262]  We'll get you when you sleep!
[02:07:19.262 --> 02:07:20.143]  Sit up!
[02:07:20.143 --> 02:07:22.325]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[02:07:23.733 --> 02:07:25.975]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[02:07:25.975 --> 02:07:26.896]  Is it contagious?
[02:07:26.896 --> 02:07:28.917]  It looked right at me.
[02:07:28.917 --> 02:07:30.318]  You need to get out!
[02:07:30.318 --> 02:07:32.280]  I'm looking at it as if it was human.
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:35.702]  Well, I'm not human.
[02:07:35.702 --> 02:07:38.905]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[02:07:38.905 --> 02:07:40.826]  We're being cornered!
[02:07:40.826 --> 02:07:44.369]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[02:07:44.369 --> 02:07:44.729]  Hey, Barry.
[02:08:11.121 --> 02:08:16.092]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:16.092 --> 02:08:17.736]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:21.354 --> 02:08:23.536]  All right, the planets have aligned.
[02:08:23.536 --> 02:08:25.718]  Sean Stone was just happy to be visiting in town.
[02:08:25.718 --> 02:08:27.520]  We talked and said, why don't you come on the show?
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:29.963]  And Vivian Kubrick is here making a documentary film.
[02:08:29.963 --> 02:08:32.225]  Both you guys are filmmakers in your own right.
[02:08:32.225 --> 02:08:36.129]  And of course, you're an author, Sean Stone, as well on a TV producer.
[02:08:36.129 --> 02:08:40.333]  And both your fathers are some of the most famous directors in history, Stanley Kubrick.
[02:08:40.333 --> 02:08:42.695]  And of course, your dad needs no introduction.
[02:08:43.636 --> 02:08:57.545]  Oliver Stone, and your dad's an expert on, and so are you, on what's happening over in Ukraine that's leading us towards World War III, the whole false flag missile attack, the World Government cashless society being announced, stolen elections, just mass psychosis.
[02:08:57.545 --> 02:08:59.347]  They're planning for new lockdowns.
[02:08:59.347 --> 02:09:01.988]  I mean, we really are stepping into the dystopia.
[02:09:01.988 --> 02:09:05.311]  I hate being vindicated, being on air 28 years, reading their own documents.
[02:09:05.311 --> 02:09:06.191]  I wasn't predicting.
[02:09:06.191 --> 02:09:06.972]  I knew they had power.
[02:09:06.972 --> 02:09:07.632]  They were planning this.
[02:09:07.632 --> 02:09:08.773]  I tried to stop it.
[02:09:08.773 --> 02:09:11.154]  Now we're in it, but people are halfway awake.
[02:09:11.154 --> 02:09:13.336]  This is, how would you describe first,
[02:09:16.738 --> 02:09:21.381]  It's like being in a dream.
[02:09:21.381 --> 02:09:28.706]  It's like being in a dream where everyone is in a sense experiencing their own realities and it's almost difficult to get us on the same
[02:09:29.983 --> 02:09:30.343]  We're good
[02:09:47.812 --> 02:09:48.813]  It is so different, right?
[02:09:48.813 --> 02:09:52.915]  I mean, life has broken down into that place where maybe that's the point.
[02:09:52.915 --> 02:10:05.322]  The beauty of it is if we can reclaim some sense of how reality in Los Angeles is 180 degrees different from what it is right now here in Austin, from what I experience and live in Florida, right?
[02:10:05.322 --> 02:10:07.703]  And maybe that's the beauty of it, is getting back to the States.
[02:10:07.703 --> 02:10:10.465]  And I think that, if anything else, my only hope right now is
[02:10:10.905 --> 02:10:12.767]  Looking at the elections going, okay, great.
[02:10:12.767 --> 02:10:13.708]  They did their rigging.
[02:10:13.708 --> 02:10:20.153]  They've drawn out these ballots for days and weeks and it's disgusting, obviously, what can be done now with the rigging.
[02:10:20.153 --> 02:10:28.701]  But look at least at Florida's totally red and Texas, obviously, they didn't get Beto in here.
[02:10:28.701 --> 02:10:31.503]  It wasn't like there were some major tectonic shifts that took place.
[02:10:31.503 --> 02:10:33.244]  So if you go to the state levels,
[02:10:33.905 --> 02:10:43.915]  There is still a fight going on, and there is still resistance going on at the state levels, and there is still opportunity, I think, for people to say, well, I can't deal with California politics anymore, I'm leaving.
[02:10:43.915 --> 02:10:54.046]  We've seen that, obviously, and I think it'll just continue, and it'll continue in the coming years, because the more that they force down our throats these policies, the more the human spirit just rejects it and says, no, that's not my reality anymore, I'm leaving.
[02:10:54.326 --> 02:10:55.026]  I totally agree with you.
[02:10:55.026 --> 02:10:59.949]  I told my wife two days ago, I said, I even cut a little prom with this canary next week where I give Thanksgiving.
[02:10:59.949 --> 02:11:03.350]  I'm more thankful now than ever because good versus evil is so clear.
[02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:10.534]  Before it was under the surface, now it's been forced out in the open and the forces of enslavement who are anti-free will are more desperate than ever.
[02:11:10.534 --> 02:11:14.596]  So this looks really bad, but it's forcing the infection.
[02:11:15.256 --> 02:11:16.417]  To the surface.
[02:11:16.417 --> 02:11:23.462]  And as you said, the paradox of being in one state like it's another country versus one that's still under the mind control is night and day.
[02:11:23.462 --> 02:11:25.243]  It shows there's a way out.
[02:11:25.243 --> 02:11:30.667]  And as people in those more enslaved areas see those of us in less enslaved areas, we become an example to them.
[02:11:30.667 --> 02:11:34.490]  Vivian Kubrick, how would you describe the place we're at right now worldwide and also here in America?
[02:11:35.100 --> 02:11:52.017]  Well, I feel like people are being challenged, unlike any other period of history, to actually interface with their true selves, to not operate from being, you know, inculcated with, you know, lies and the psyops.
[02:11:52.017 --> 02:11:54.959]  In fact, Sean and I were just talking about this before we went live on air.
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:58.841]  That people need to understand how the PSYOPs work.
[02:11:58.841 --> 02:12:02.641]  That's going to really help them emerge as their true selves.
[02:12:02.641 --> 02:12:05.422]  Because PSYOPs are weird.
[02:12:05.422 --> 02:12:06.882]  You know, they really do affect you.
[02:12:06.882 --> 02:12:08.743]  They affect me.
[02:12:08.743 --> 02:12:14.184]  And it's so... God, what's the right word?
[02:12:14.184 --> 02:12:15.284]  It... I can't think of it.
[02:12:15.284 --> 02:12:17.785]  It begins with I. Not seeing anything I can remember about it.
[02:12:17.785 --> 02:12:19.565]  Anyway... It's very surreal.
[02:12:20.565 --> 02:12:37.999]  Well, it's very surreal when you actually start to see, like I was saying the other night, the mainstream media cut together all the talking heads and then this super sinister alignment of everything they're saying is the same sentence.
[02:12:37.999 --> 02:12:40.421]  That is so terrifying to me.
[02:12:40.421 --> 02:12:48.427]  And if only people could just see 30 seconds of those kinds of videos, they're going to go, wait a minute, nobody's actually independently reporting the news.
[02:12:48.427 --> 02:12:48.868]  That's right.
[02:12:49.428 --> 02:12:52.470]  CBS, NBC, all of them in the exact same script.
[02:12:52.470 --> 02:12:54.411]  That's when you're in a tyranny.
[02:12:54.411 --> 02:12:56.352]  Or a tyranny trying to take over.
[02:12:56.352 --> 02:12:58.453]  I had this conversation recently about you, Alex.
[02:12:58.453 --> 02:12:58.913]  It was funny.
[02:12:58.913 --> 02:12:59.554]  I was in L.A.
[02:12:59.554 --> 02:13:02.555]  and I was talking to a filmmaker there.
[02:13:02.555 --> 02:13:12.421]  He was basically giving me the talking points as to why you were being sued because you had incited people to digging up graves and terrorizing the Sandy Hook parents.
[02:13:13.772 --> 02:13:21.298]  Well, I'm not sure if that's true, but if that is true, if he's guilty of incitement, think about the consequence of that.
[02:13:21.298 --> 02:13:23.319]  And it's like, only then did I actually catch him.
[02:13:23.319 --> 02:13:25.561]  He was thinking about it, and I go, think about that.
[02:13:25.561 --> 02:13:32.907]  So you say something that incites me, and I go over there and I rob someone, or I kill someone, and now you're responsible?
[02:13:32.907 --> 02:13:34.288]  Actually, I just want to say something.
[02:13:34.288 --> 02:13:35.609]  That takes everybody else's freedom.
[02:13:35.609 --> 02:13:36.410]  But that's the whole point.
[02:13:36.410 --> 02:13:38.771]  We've lost responsibility if we're guilty of incitement.
[02:13:38.771 --> 02:13:40.212]  My father got sued for this in the 90s.
[02:13:41.698 --> 02:13:55.123]  I just want to say, with Cloaca Corringe, people at the time, people were raping and killing and robbing and then they were saying, oh, I did it because I saw Cloaca Corringe, which I doubt was ever true.
[02:13:55.123 --> 02:13:58.865]  But anyway, Margaret Whitehouse, I think that's her name, I can't remember now.
[02:13:58.865 --> 02:14:05.027]  Anyway, she was a big kind of like, you know, moral compass for the conservative world.
[02:14:05.367 --> 02:14:12.611]  You know, said that my father was responsible for these things and it became so bad that my father actually said, right, that's it.
[02:14:12.611 --> 02:14:15.953]  I don't want Clockwork Orange to be shown in England again as long as I live.
[02:14:15.953 --> 02:14:21.757]  Because he was being... I mean, literally, I couldn't... And of course, the film makes you not want to be violent and is anti-violence.
[02:14:22.177 --> 02:14:22.958]  I mean, like...
[02:14:53.277 --> 02:14:54.658]  What?
[02:14:54.658 --> 02:14:57.959]  I said that's a very interesting interpretation of Clockwork Orange.
[02:14:57.959 --> 02:15:04.541]  When really the novel in your dad's film, it's obvious the state's corrupt and evil and it's reflecting down to the grassroots.
[02:15:04.541 --> 02:15:06.001]  And that's what it's saying.
[02:15:06.001 --> 02:15:09.963]  Well, that was exactly the point of Clockwork Orange, which inspired Natural Born Killers in some way.
[02:15:09.963 --> 02:15:10.863]  Did it?
[02:15:10.863 --> 02:15:11.563]  Well, it was involved.
[02:15:11.563 --> 02:15:20.926]  I mean, I know that my father, when I was in the film Natural Born Killers as the little brother of Mallory Knox, right, the Julia Lewis character, he had me wear the Clockwork Orange makeup.
[02:15:21.426 --> 02:15:24.127]  Just like they promote mass shootings, they know it causes more.
[02:15:37.711 --> 02:15:39.592]  Well, it's like they promote the mass shootings.
[02:15:39.592 --> 02:15:40.513]  Look at Netflix right now.
[02:15:40.513 --> 02:15:44.335]  I mean, most of Netflix's shows are about crime, serial killers, Dahmer.
[02:15:44.335 --> 02:15:45.495]  It's, you know, cannibalism.
[02:15:45.495 --> 02:15:48.877]  It's like, it's a very brutal, dark perspective of reality, right?
[02:15:48.877 --> 02:15:51.318]  That's what's feeding, that's what we're basically being fed.
[02:15:51.318 --> 02:15:52.279]  This is powerful.
[02:15:52.279 --> 02:15:53.900]  Sean Stone, Vivian Kubrick, stay with us.
[02:15:53.900 --> 02:15:54.920]  Let's come right back to this topic.
[02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:56.261]  When we come back, stay with us.

[02:16:09.811 --> 02:16:15.214]  He is consecutively the most Googled man in the world in the last two years.
[02:16:15.214 --> 02:16:19.817]  And that's because his message is about human, and specifically, male empowerment.
[02:16:20.297 --> 02:16:26.560]  Now, Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.

[02:16:59.755 --> 02:17:05.760]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:09.903]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:17:09.903 --> 02:17:16.169]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:17:17.950 --> 02:17:25.093]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[02:17:25.093 --> 02:17:30.955]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:17:30.955 --> 02:17:39.659]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including
[02:17:40.399 --> 02:17:46.305]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[02:18:06.610 --> 02:18:16.998]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.

[02:18:30.407 --> 02:18:41.914]  Treatment packages specifically for COVID, post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes, and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[02:18:41.914 --> 02:18:50.119]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health advice.
[02:18:50.119 --> 02:18:58.284]  Come see The Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to The Wellness Company.
[02:18:59.418 --> 02:19:10.751]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[02:19:10.751 --> 02:19:12.633]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[02:19:12.633 --> 02:19:14.095]  That's what they want to take away.
[02:19:14.095 --> 02:19:15.597]  Your ability to speak freely.
[02:19:15.597 --> 02:19:17.319]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[02:19:17.319 --> 02:19:18.600]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:20.002]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[02:19:20.402 --> 02:19:25.247]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[02:19:25.247 --> 02:19:27.649]  And I warned the public, as a modern Paul Revere.
[02:19:27.649 --> 02:19:29.671]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[02:19:29.671 --> 02:19:36.618]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet about East America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda.
[02:19:37.239 --> 02:19:42.623]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[02:19:42.623 --> 02:19:51.569]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsTore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[02:19:51.569 --> 02:20:00.055]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsTore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[02:20:00.055 --> 02:20:05.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:16.084 --> 02:20:18.646]  Sean Stone, Vivian Kubrick, in studio here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:18.646 --> 02:20:21.328]  So you got cut off by the bricks, Sean and Vivian.
[02:20:21.328 --> 02:20:23.249]  You're talking about your dad makes a film against violence.
[02:20:23.249 --> 02:20:24.370]  Your dad makes a film against violence.
[02:20:24.370 --> 02:20:28.353]  It's obviously somebody that is empathetic and smart.
[02:20:28.353 --> 02:20:29.754]  It's obviously horrible.
[02:20:29.754 --> 02:20:30.675]  Makes you hate violence.
[02:20:30.675 --> 02:20:35.858]  And it's obviously the state has created a process that creates these creatures and then hires them as their police later.
[02:20:35.858 --> 02:20:39.341]  You know, the novel is powerful as well, Clockwork Orange.
[02:20:39.341 --> 02:20:42.023]  And then they turn it around and say, you're promoting violence when it was
[02:20:43.356 --> 02:20:50.060]  Both your fathers in those films exposing that the system in studies is actually creating the violence loop.
[02:20:50.060 --> 02:20:50.520]  Right, right.
[02:20:50.520 --> 02:21:05.489]  I mean that's, well at least that was the intention of Natural Born Killers as well as Clockwork Orange, but with Natural Born Killers you recall there was a lawsuit that was brought in the 90s against my father by Grisham and Company because of a person that was seriously crippled.
[02:21:05.489 --> 02:21:07.590]  She was crippled by a shooter.
[02:21:08.090 --> 02:21:13.312]  Who basically said that this guy went out there and he said, I saw Natural Born Killers a hundred times on mushrooms or whatever.
[02:21:13.312 --> 02:21:20.096]  And they wanted to role play basically and play Mickey, you know, Mickey and Mallory and they shot people up.
[02:21:20.096 --> 02:21:27.039]  And so the idea was that the lawsuit was against Oliver Stone and Warner Brothers as making a faulty product, right?
[02:21:27.039 --> 02:21:31.441]  Like they inspired these shootings and it's like, but that's the problem.
[02:21:31.441 --> 02:21:33.802]  It's you can't go down this path of saying,
[02:21:33.882 --> 02:21:34.723]  That's what they did with me.
[02:21:34.723 --> 02:21:50.299]  They misrepresented what I said, took it out of context, made it a huge issue, claimed I made it a big issue, judge found me guilty, and then now they call it the Alex Jones precedent where they can claim if anybody does anything we claim encourages somebody else to do something, then I'm at fault for someone digging up someone's grave that it turns out never even happened.
[02:21:50.299 --> 02:21:50.459]  Right.
[02:21:50.779 --> 02:21:55.800]  But you know, you're both talking about a key issue about us as humanity.
[02:21:55.800 --> 02:21:58.641]  Is that, are we going to be responsible for ourselves?
[02:21:58.641 --> 02:22:09.784]  Or are we always going to have Big Nanny and Big Nanny in our head going, well, I must take care of humanity and make sure that I never put anything out which might cause them to go and strangle somebody.
[02:22:09.784 --> 02:22:14.706]  Why wouldn't we expect for humanity to go, well, strangling people is bad.
[02:22:14.706 --> 02:22:18.347]  Even though it's in this film, I'm not going to do it because it's terrible.
[02:22:18.667 --> 02:22:24.580]  And it's just like you were saying, you know, earlier though, the system knows full well that that's not the case.
[02:22:24.580 --> 02:22:27.686]  They never criticize their product that's actually designed to do it.
[02:22:27.686 --> 02:22:29.249]  They criticize those that are trying to stop it.
[02:22:30.290 --> 02:22:37.632]  You know, again, it's gotten to a very dangerous place, as you say, Vivian, when you let go of individual responsibility.
[02:22:37.632 --> 02:22:39.492]  Because that's what we've seen the last two years, right?
[02:22:39.492 --> 02:22:47.034]  I mean, the whole thing with the pandemic was like, no one, I remember seeing this quote recently, it's like, no one is safe until everyone is safe.
[02:22:47.034 --> 02:22:47.674]  Oh, God.
[02:22:47.674 --> 02:22:50.275]  And it's like, what does that even mean?
[02:22:50.275 --> 02:22:51.555]  You're never going to be safe.
[02:22:51.555 --> 02:22:51.975]  I'm sorry.
[02:22:51.975 --> 02:22:53.876]  And now we know it doesn't protect you and is a fraud.
[02:22:53.876 --> 02:22:57.397]  So what did that director say when you pointed out you're next?
[02:22:57.397 --> 02:22:57.697]  Who's that?
[02:22:58.424 --> 02:23:02.926]  You said you were talking to a filmmaker and you said once they get Alex Jones, now you can be blamed as well.
[02:23:02.926 --> 02:23:05.107]  Right, well that was actually an interesting moment.
[02:23:05.107 --> 02:23:11.150]  I think that we did then get to a more common ground because he was so agitated against you, personally, and that's the point.
[02:23:11.150 --> 02:23:12.730]  Sorry, which director?
[02:23:12.730 --> 02:23:14.011]  I'm not going to say it.
[02:23:14.011 --> 02:23:23.175]  The point is that, you know, when people are so personally, you know, we've gotten to this place, right, where it's about, you know, if Trump says it, it doesn't matter what it is.
[02:23:23.175 --> 02:23:24.395]  The sky's blue, he's wrong.
[02:23:24.395 --> 02:23:25.316]  You know, we don't like him.
[02:23:25.996 --> 02:23:33.019]  And we've turned this into an inability to hear what's being said because we so are ready to attack whoever says it, right?
[02:23:33.019 --> 02:23:35.399]  So if Alex says it, then it must be bad.
[02:23:35.399 --> 02:23:41.362]  But if I say it and all of a sudden it's like, huh, oh, maybe that actually makes sense, you know, because maybe I'm not as controversial.
[02:23:41.362 --> 02:23:49.325]  Or Democrat Congress members incite violence against Republicans and say it's good that Scalise got shot or good that Rand Paul got his ribs broken and lung pierced.
[02:23:49.325 --> 02:23:50.525]  That's good.
[02:23:50.525 --> 02:23:52.746]  But then they lie and say, I invoked violence when I didn't.
[02:23:53.424 --> 02:23:58.848]  But that's, again, I mean, even if they did say that was good, you know what, they have the right to say that.
[02:23:58.848 --> 02:23:59.428]  I agree, they do.
[02:23:59.428 --> 02:24:00.369]  And we acknowledge that.
[02:24:00.369 --> 02:24:01.770]  We acknowledge that freedom of speech.
[02:24:01.770 --> 02:24:21.285]  And that's what's just, it's so difficult for us to fathom, you know, Vivian, you've been alive a little longer than I have, but like just going through these decades of watching how society has tried to normalize the idea that free speech is not inherently free, that we should be censored.
[02:24:21.285 --> 02:24:22.205]  So Vivian and Sean,
[02:24:23.206 --> 02:24:28.275]  What is the process the social engineers are in trying to restrict the general public speech?
[02:24:28.275 --> 02:24:29.478]  I see it as a sign of weakness.
[02:24:30.276 --> 02:24:34.660]  Oh, it's without question weakness, because they don't want to be challenged in any way.
[02:24:34.660 --> 02:24:42.686]  But I think that that's the nature of bullies and criminals, is that they only know how to crush in order to achieve their ends.
[02:24:42.686 --> 02:24:52.735]  And I think what we have to understand is there's nothing more important than having dialogue, exchanging ideas, defending our position, but also being willing to listen.
[02:24:52.735 --> 02:24:55.457]  But that would be the mark of maturity.
[02:24:55.457 --> 02:24:57.219]  And right now they've tried to, you know,
[02:24:57.759 --> 02:25:08.704]  Create infantile populations who, you know, look to the government to, you know, be saved or look to the government for the truth and won't do anything unless they're given a go-ahead.
[02:25:08.704 --> 02:25:09.945]  It's terrifying.
[02:25:09.945 --> 02:25:12.025]  I absolutely agree.
[02:25:12.025 --> 02:25:13.886]  Can the general population be saved?
[02:25:13.886 --> 02:25:18.869]  Because if they do get brainwashed into an animal form, now they're a howling mob that can be used against us.
[02:25:18.869 --> 02:25:19.889]  I don't want to kill them.
[02:25:19.889 --> 02:25:20.989]  I don't want to put everybody in prison.
[02:25:20.989 --> 02:25:23.811]  But it's really an alchemy that's happening where
[02:25:24.491 --> 02:25:28.158]  I've had globalists tell me, they say, look, the public's a bunch of animals, they're going to get everybody.
[02:25:28.158 --> 02:25:29.861]  You'll be on our side soon enough.
[02:25:29.861 --> 02:25:35.551]  They say they're hastening the process of societal collapse because they believe it's going to collapse anyway, so why not just get it over with?
[02:25:37.401 --> 02:25:44.166]  You know, I saw today's study validating a lot of the stuff you were talking about with the drop in male fertility and sperm, right?
[02:25:44.166 --> 02:25:48.049]  And it's like I saw it was up, down a drop in 60% in the last 50 years.
[02:25:48.049 --> 02:25:51.712]  So we've gone past the 50% mark into the 60 plus percent mark.
[02:25:51.712 --> 02:25:55.735]  And obviously, we know that the shots, the COVID shots are designed to affect
[02:25:56.195 --> 02:25:59.977]  The ovaries and they're affecting, obviously, female periods.
[02:25:59.977 --> 02:26:03.598]  I think that 2021 was the first year I saw no one really caught that.
[02:26:03.598 --> 02:26:07.000]  They said in America there was really no increase in population for the first time.
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:07.780]  It was really interesting.
[02:26:07.780 --> 02:26:10.361]  I mean, I'm not, I don't know about the immigrant or the migrant.
[02:26:10.361 --> 02:26:13.583]  A precipitous drop directly connected in the German study to the shot.
[02:26:14.283 --> 02:26:19.586]  But that's for sure, the point being that we are now going to go into this collapse, at least in the West.
[02:26:19.586 --> 02:26:23.648]  Now, a lot of the Eastern world didn't get the shots, right?
[02:26:23.648 --> 02:26:27.751]  A lot of Africa, a lot of Asian countries, a lot of poor countries didn't necessarily do this.
[02:26:27.751 --> 02:26:31.673]  Well, the globalists say it's the first world producing the most, so they hit us first.
[02:26:32.566 --> 02:26:33.287]  Right, right.
[02:26:33.287 --> 02:26:39.631]  And this is going to be really what's so interesting to see how this plays out in this coming time period, right?
[02:26:39.631 --> 02:26:42.132]  The overall, you know, fourth industrial revolution, right?
[02:26:42.132 --> 02:26:50.217]  They want a centralized, controlled population in cities that are sort of sterilized, that basically go like Brave New World.
[02:26:50.217 --> 02:26:55.501]  You want to, you know, have a child, you go into the doctor and you basically go choose your, you know, your ovary.
[02:26:55.501 --> 02:26:57.582]  I guess you choose the ovary, you choose, you know, the sperm.
[02:26:57.582 --> 02:27:01.385]  And they're admitting that's their plan and we're just trying to have a debate about the world they're building.
[02:27:01.385 --> 02:27:01.585]  Right.
[02:27:02.105 --> 02:27:03.966]  Sorry, I must just say something.
[02:27:03.966 --> 02:27:22.797]  Let's just acknowledge the fact that these people are insane, they're psychopathic, they have no empathy, and what they're trying to create is so diabolical that to describe it as anything like they're planning this, they're planning... No, this is the act of kind of computing psychotics.
[02:27:22.797 --> 02:27:29.001]  They've got the ability to be brilliant, but they have no ability to be human, and... They're in love with the... I call it the science of tyranny.
[02:27:29.605 --> 02:27:31.445]  Well, actually, yeah.
[02:27:31.445 --> 02:27:44.849]  I think I mentioned this the last time, but anybody who wants to look at the most absolutely gobsmacking, incredible fact, Aristotle, 2400 years ago, in his book on ethics, wrote about, if you want to create a tyranny, this is what you do.
[02:27:44.849 --> 02:27:46.609]  It's about two or three pages long.
[02:27:46.609 --> 02:27:52.811]  I invite everyone to go and look at it, because you will realize how ancient this playbook is.
[02:27:52.811 --> 02:27:54.451]  Oh, Plato is their model.
[02:27:54.451 --> 02:27:55.511]  No, Aristotle.
[02:27:55.511 --> 02:27:56.712]  Well, I suppose he was his student.
[02:27:58.220 --> 02:28:01.081]  Tell me the particular Aristotle derivatives so we can look that up.
[02:28:01.081 --> 02:28:02.381]  Oh, um... I remember.
[02:28:02.381 --> 02:28:04.042]  We'll try to find it during the break, but yes.
[02:28:04.042 --> 02:28:07.543]  Just look up Syracuse and Persia.
[02:28:07.543 --> 02:28:19.866]  If you do a word search, I think it'll get you straight to it, because he talks about these women who are spies, and I think they're called the Whores of Syracuse or something.
[02:28:19.866 --> 02:28:21.927]  Guys, look up Aristotle, the Whores of Syracuse.
[02:28:22.267 --> 02:28:25.449]  Well, Syracuse, just as a word search.
[02:28:25.449 --> 02:28:30.513]  Anyway, probably it would take about five minutes to read it.
[02:28:30.513 --> 02:28:36.637]  You will be absolutely shocked to see that if you want to run a tyranny, it's always been run the same way.
[02:28:36.637 --> 02:28:39.839]  Twenty-four hundred years ago, they're doing exactly what they're doing now.
[02:28:39.839 --> 02:28:41.581]  Well, you've cut right to the root.
[02:28:41.581 --> 02:28:45.143]  It was Plato that wrote up these plans.
[02:28:45.143 --> 02:28:46.264]  Yeah.
[02:28:46.264 --> 02:28:51.628]  Well, I mean, they're public in how he imagined society being run in fashion.
[02:28:52.526 --> 02:28:53.787]  Actually, can I just say something?
[02:28:53.787 --> 02:28:54.007]  Go ahead.
[02:28:54.007 --> 02:28:54.727]  Oh, yeah, I got a break.
[02:28:54.727 --> 02:28:56.048]  The trees were still on there as radio stations.
[02:28:56.048 --> 02:28:56.988]  I know they're annoying.
[02:28:56.988 --> 02:28:58.369]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:58.369 --> 02:29:09.235]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[02:29:09.235 --> 02:29:13.697]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[02:29:13.697 --> 02:29:17.660]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:20.861]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[02:29:22.082 --> 02:29:28.147]  You see, the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[02:29:28.147 --> 02:29:32.030]  But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3.
[02:29:32.030 --> 02:29:36.794]  And then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[02:29:36.794 --> 02:29:41.538]  So now it's more important than ever, because the winner's here, to take high quality vitamin D3.
[02:29:41.538 --> 02:29:47.223]  And we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into your body for 50% off at InfoWars.com.
[02:29:48.524 --> 02:29:49.105]  We're good to go.
[02:29:57.751 --> 02:30:18.383]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[02:30:18.883 --> 02:30:32.006]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[02:30:32.006 --> 02:30:47.090]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air and what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[02:30:47.370 --> 02:30:48.812]  So, continue to do it.
[02:30:48.812 --> 02:30:50.995]  Go to places like Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:50.995 --> 02:30:53.097]  Go to the places like Save Infowars.
[02:30:53.097 --> 02:30:58.063]  Continue to keep Infowars alive, because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[02:30:58.624 --> 02:31:07.187]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[02:31:07.187 --> 02:31:16.810]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day.
[02:31:16.810 --> 02:31:18.490]  And that's the problem.
[02:31:18.490 --> 02:31:21.251]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[02:31:21.251 --> 02:31:24.012]  They illegally changed state elections.
[02:31:24.912 --> 02:31:30.454]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[02:31:30.454 --> 02:31:32.475]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[02:31:32.475 --> 02:31:36.736]  We are in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[02:31:36.736 --> 02:31:51.842]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question the fact that elections
[02:31:52.562 --> 02:31:54.704]  Um, shouldn't be run the way they are.
[02:31:54.704 --> 02:31:58.908]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[02:31:58.908 --> 02:32:10.679]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[02:32:10.679 --> 02:32:13.781]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it was
[02:32:14.622 --> 02:32:15.002]  We're good.
[02:32:31.237 --> 02:32:37.199]  For the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[02:32:37.199 --> 02:32:39.580]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:41.481]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[02:32:41.481 --> 02:32:43.702]  It'll literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[02:32:43.702 --> 02:32:44.462]  It's amazing.
[02:32:44.462 --> 02:32:44.962]  It works.
[02:32:44.962 --> 02:32:47.463]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[02:32:47.463 --> 02:32:53.706]  We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[02:32:53.706 --> 02:32:54.966]  Beautifully said, brother.
[02:32:54.966 --> 02:32:56.927]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[02:32:59.406 --> 02:33:11.252]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:11.252 --> 02:33:16.694]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:32.566 --> 02:33:37.388]  People have asked me what I think of Elon Musk, and I've kind of told you, but it would take an hour to really break it down.
[02:33:37.388 --> 02:33:39.229]  It's important.
[02:33:39.229 --> 02:33:41.590]  He's the next level of the New World Order.
[02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:43.471]  He plays both sides.
[02:33:43.471 --> 02:33:46.773]  He says he's pro-humanity, but he also goes along with our whole agenda.
[02:33:46.773 --> 02:33:48.214]  I don't know if he's a good guy or a bad guy.
[02:33:48.214 --> 02:33:50.035]  I'd say the tree bites fruits.
[02:33:50.035 --> 02:33:51.035]  But I told everybody this.
[02:33:51.035 --> 02:33:52.416]  I'm not worried about getting back on Twitter.
[02:33:53.817 --> 02:33:56.639]  He's under such attack, even trying to make it quasi-free.
[02:33:56.639 --> 02:33:57.820]  They're destroying it right now.
[02:33:57.820 --> 02:34:02.404]  But he did respond to folks asking him today, what should Twitter do next?
[02:34:02.404 --> 02:34:04.846]  And a lot of folks said, bring back Alex Jones.
[02:34:04.846 --> 02:34:07.629]  His response was, no.
[02:34:07.629 --> 02:34:12.293]  So that is kind of a litmus test because that's a bridge too far.
[02:34:12.293 --> 02:34:13.714]  But that's part of that process.
[02:34:13.714 --> 02:34:15.335]  Now, Vivian Kubrick's here.
[02:34:15.335 --> 02:34:16.336]  So is Sean Stone.
[02:34:16.336 --> 02:34:17.757]  We've got a lot to talk about.
[02:34:17.757 --> 02:34:18.898]  A lot of big issues.
[02:34:18.898 --> 02:34:20.660]  But you were getting into philosophy and going back.
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:26.081]  To the Greek philosopher Aristotle and his mentor.
[02:34:26.081 --> 02:34:29.382]  And of course, Plato put out two, three sides to everything.
[02:34:29.382 --> 02:34:33.564]  But he was the first to say that the plebes are crushing the breast of Mother Earth.
[02:34:33.564 --> 02:34:35.924]  We need to ban poor people breeding.
[02:34:35.924 --> 02:34:38.005]  We need to have breeding programs to make better people.
[02:34:38.005 --> 02:34:41.086]  What he talked about later got picked up by the Romans, then it got picked up
[02:34:41.926 --> 02:34:49.271]  By Malthus, then it got picked up by Francis Galton, then it got picked up by the eugenicists in England and then Adolf Hitler.
[02:34:49.271 --> 02:34:57.637]  So when we see the transhumanists, they all hail from that same school, the discoverer of DNA, you know, saying blacks are subhuman and all that.
[02:34:57.637 --> 02:35:04.562]  It's really the same group, but now as you talked about Bertrand Russell, it's all wrapped in a liberal, neoliberal packaging.
[02:35:05.848 --> 02:35:12.971]  Well, I was just saying to Sean, actually, in the break, you know, you can't reinvent the wheel, really, and to have a tyranny, you basically have to do the same thing.
[02:35:12.971 --> 02:35:31.120]  So, I just want to say, if you want to read about Plato, really, ironically, written by a eugenicist and whatever, Bertrand Russell, if you go to the History of Western Philosophy, Chapter 14, I think it is, you'll see described there, basically, the blueprint for the globalists.
[02:35:31.120 --> 02:35:33.101]  And I would say that, to put it in a nutshell,
[02:35:34.341 --> 02:35:42.985]  Whatever it is that determines somebody's state of consciousness, what's consistent here is that they have contempt for others.
[02:35:42.985 --> 02:35:49.829]  And it seems like what's really astonishing is they always have the same old playbook, and they... Total, total conceit.
[02:35:49.829 --> 02:35:50.409]  You've got a quote.
[02:35:50.409 --> 02:35:50.989]  Tell us where it's from.
[02:35:50.989 --> 02:35:51.630]  Contempt.
[02:35:51.630 --> 02:35:51.890]  Right.
[02:35:51.890 --> 02:35:57.773]  So this is from Aristotle's Ethics, and this is how to have a tyranny, a successful one.
[02:35:58.573 --> 02:36:02.115]  Uh, as to tyrannies, they are preserved in two most opposite ways.
[02:36:02.115 --> 02:36:06.578]  One of them is the old traditional method in which most tyrants administer their government.
[02:36:06.578 --> 02:36:15.504]  Of such arts, Persian of, sorry, uh, yeah, Peridot, I can't read that, of Corinth is said to have been the great master.
[02:36:15.504 --> 02:36:20.187]  And many similar devices may be gathered from the Persians in the administration of their government.
[02:36:20.187 --> 02:36:26.832]  They are firstly, the prescriptions met, the prescriptions met, mentioned some distance back, sorry this is all,
[02:36:27.712 --> 02:36:28.473]  Lead up.
[02:36:28.473 --> 02:36:30.916]  Okay, some distance back.
[02:36:30.916 --> 02:36:39.867]  For the preservation of a tyranny, in so far as this is possible, that the tyrant should lop off those who are too high.
[02:36:39.867 --> 02:36:42.570]  He must put to death men of spirit.
[02:36:42.570 --> 02:36:46.735]  He must not allow common meals, clubs, education and the like.
[02:36:48.058 --> 02:36:56.703]  He must be upon his guard against anything which is likely to inspire either courage or confidence amongst his subjects.
[02:36:56.703 --> 02:37:08.391]  He must prohibit literary assemblies or other meetings for discussion, and he must take every means to prevent people from knowing one another, for acquaintance begets mutual confidence.
[02:37:09.131 --> 02:37:16.056]  Further, he must compel all persons staying in the city to appear in public and live at his gates.
[02:37:16.056 --> 02:37:18.277]  Then he will know what they are doing.
[02:37:18.277 --> 02:37:21.319]  If they are always kept under, they will learn to be humble.
[02:37:21.319 --> 02:37:27.463]  In short, he should practice these and the like Persian and barbaric arts, which all have the same object.
[02:37:28.203 --> 02:37:47.647]  A tyrant should also endeavor to know what each of his subjects says or does, and should employ spies like the female detectives, sorry, not whores, female detectives of Syracuse, and the eavesdroppers who Hero was in the habit of sending to any place of resort or meeting.
[02:37:47.647 --> 02:37:55.088]  For the fear of informers prevents people from speaking their minds, and if they do, they are more easily found out.
[02:37:55.828 --> 02:38:00.290]  Another art of the tyrant is to sow quarrels amongst the citizens.
[02:38:00.290 --> 02:38:05.272]  Friends should be embroiled with friends, the people with the notables, and the rich with one another.
[02:38:05.272 --> 02:38:07.773]  Also, he should impoverish his subjects.
[02:38:07.773 --> 02:38:17.036]  He thus provides against the maintenance of a guard by the citizen, and the people, having to keep hard at work, are prevented from conspiring.
[02:38:17.036 --> 02:38:17.797]  I mean, it goes on.
[02:38:17.797 --> 02:38:18.477]  But that's 2400 years ago.
[02:38:18.477 --> 02:38:19.217]  It's so interesting, the...
[02:38:21.658 --> 02:38:37.909]  You know, the concept of the cancel culture, I see it is very much like the old like the spy network in the old days, you know, and the idea of being found out for what you said and being found out for thinking in a way that could be construed as dangerous or different.
[02:38:37.909 --> 02:38:38.129]  Right.
[02:38:38.129 --> 02:38:42.972]  And so how it's or it's now it's it's self-imposed cancellation that occurs.
[02:38:42.972 --> 02:38:43.593]  Right.
[02:38:43.593 --> 02:38:45.514]  You don't allow yourself to say what you think.
[02:38:45.514 --> 02:38:51.438]  You don't allow yourself to be heard saying something that can be attacked and targeted and you self-censor.
[02:38:51.658 --> 02:38:52.419]  That's right.
[02:38:52.419 --> 02:38:57.186]  And if you look at that model, all of it has now been compounded and we see it being done today.
[02:38:58.466 --> 02:39:01.167]  It's all before our eyes now.
[02:39:01.167 --> 02:39:03.308]  And that's what's the crazy part.
[02:39:03.308 --> 02:39:07.229]  Things that are in front of our faces, we can't talk about.
[02:39:07.229 --> 02:39:15.772]  Even to the place now, finally the Congress is hopefully going to do something with this Hunter Biden story and the corruption of old Joe.
[02:39:15.772 --> 02:39:23.314]  But the point being that even to this day, people are being accused of conspiracy theory for talking about it.
[02:39:24.721 --> 02:39:34.864]  What's with this, it's a conspiracy theory, can we just finally say out loud that the CIA came up with this terminology in order to... They weaponized it.
[02:39:34.864 --> 02:39:39.125]  They said you have to slander the conspiracy theorists.
[02:39:39.125 --> 02:39:49.868]  Your dad made JFK, which is an excellent film, it won't really happen, but it came out a few years after that the CIA said, people questioning, we just call it conspiracy theory so that we can ridicule those without looking at the actual evidence.
[02:39:50.307 --> 02:39:54.468]  Yeah, it was very clear how they targeted anyone that questioned the Warrant Commission.
[02:39:54.468 --> 02:39:56.769]  But the point is that the government uses conspiracy all the time.
[02:39:56.769 --> 02:40:00.130]  So I try to say to people, look at RICO Acts.
[02:40:00.130 --> 02:40:08.013]  The government uses conspiracy when it goes after drug dealers, when it goes after, you know, even, you name it, Trump, you know, they go after these things on conspiracy, right?
[02:40:08.013 --> 02:40:09.153]  The January 6th stuff.
[02:40:09.153 --> 02:40:12.994]  I mean, it's like, it's all government usage of conspiracy that no one questions.
[02:40:12.994 --> 02:40:18.976]  Why is it that if I say conspiracy, you know, everyone's, Big Tobacco, that was, the government went after them on conspiracy.
[02:40:19.036 --> 02:40:20.997]  And here's the control, though, when you pull back.
[02:40:20.997 --> 02:40:25.638]  I have articles right here where Biden got questioned about the new congressional investigation into his son.
[02:40:25.638 --> 02:40:28.139]  He said, that's a conspiracy theory that's been debunked.
[02:40:28.139 --> 02:40:32.861]  And they censored everybody two plus years ago during the campaign that tried to raise it, even though they now admit it's real.
[02:40:32.861 --> 02:40:37.443]  But in the audio and in the video, they're taking orders from the head of Chinese intelligence.
[02:40:37.443 --> 02:40:41.464]  So they make it about Burisma and gas companies and 10 percent for the big guy.
[02:40:41.464 --> 02:40:47.066]  That's a diversion from him saying, me and my dad take orders from Xi Jinping, which is true.
[02:40:47.066 --> 02:40:48.347]  That's really the big enchilada.
[02:40:48.627 --> 02:40:53.090]  Yeah, that's a big quote.
[02:40:53.090 --> 02:40:59.554]  Well, I'll tell you, my honest opinion is that there isn't a political system, there is just gangsterism.
[02:40:59.554 --> 02:41:00.555]  That's how this planet works.
[02:41:00.555 --> 02:41:02.076]  No, I agree, it's a group of gangsters.
[02:41:02.076 --> 02:41:16.065]  Yeah, so I mean, anything that you've learned about the Mafia, just apply it to government and all of this so-called diplomatic... I'm sure... Well, that's another big psy-op, that Italians invented organized crime and they're the only ones that do this.
[02:41:17.619 --> 02:41:22.926]  I mean, the globalist mafia, it's the real mafia.
[02:41:22.926 --> 02:41:23.987]  And ancient.
[02:41:23.987 --> 02:41:25.389]  Thousands of years.
[02:41:25.389 --> 02:41:31.657]  Thousands of years of mafia, of rulership, of empires, and then all of a sudden it becomes, you know, democracy, so-called.
[02:41:31.657 --> 02:41:33.599]  You could write a book on the secret mafia.
[02:41:33.599 --> 02:41:34.160]  The real mafia.
[02:41:35.854 --> 02:41:37.835]  Well, I don't know enough of those old families.
[02:41:37.835 --> 02:41:40.736]  I think, Vivian, you don't need those old families?
[02:41:40.736 --> 02:41:44.938]  This is what I know, is that it takes a certain kind of human being and they exist all over the place.
[02:41:44.938 --> 02:41:47.059]  I was about to say, they'll use any group or any organization.
[02:41:47.059 --> 02:41:49.720]  It's a cult of philosophy.
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:51.801]  It's a cult of criminal beings.
[02:41:51.801 --> 02:41:53.262]  It's like Soros working with the Nazis.
[02:41:53.262 --> 02:41:54.563]  I mean, it doesn't matter.
[02:41:54.563 --> 02:41:55.403]  It's just what they do.
[02:41:55.743 --> 02:41:59.008]  By the way, if anybody hasn't seen this, you need to find this.
[02:41:59.008 --> 02:42:11.046]  George Soros gave this interview, probably about, I don't know, 25 years or 30 years ago, where he just matter-of-factly, which is so classic of psychopaths, admits that he helped the Nazis, and he suggests, I would do it again.
[02:42:12.170 --> 02:42:13.611]  If I didn't do it, who else?
[02:42:13.611 --> 02:42:14.592]  Someone else would.
[02:42:14.592 --> 02:42:17.035]  Yeah, and it was the happiest time of my life.
[02:42:17.035 --> 02:42:20.378]  It shaped his psychology, which is what's so important to understand about Soros.
[02:42:20.378 --> 02:42:23.301]  But now you can't, you know, Wikipedia, you know, is all Soros agents.
[02:42:23.301 --> 02:42:25.283]  So that's why so much is scrubbed on.
[02:42:25.283 --> 02:42:26.544]  Soros is a good person.
[02:42:26.544 --> 02:42:26.984]  Right?
[02:42:26.984 --> 02:42:27.425]  What?
[02:42:27.425 --> 02:42:28.226]  Exactly.
[02:42:28.226 --> 02:42:28.566]  Joking.
[02:42:30.107 --> 02:42:31.348]  This is the ridiculous of the time, though.
[02:42:31.348 --> 02:42:33.169]  You say something against Soros, you're anti-Semitic.
[02:42:33.169 --> 02:42:37.392]  I mean, it's like, that has nothing to do with it, too.
[02:42:37.392 --> 02:42:40.854]  It's like saying someone is being a gangster, and you're saying, well, you're anti-Italian.
[02:42:40.854 --> 02:42:43.837]  It's like, just because that person's a gangster doesn't mean they're racist.
[02:42:43.837 --> 02:42:49.841]  This is a great trick that they're playing on people, and you've got to, like, stop getting into this, people.
[02:42:49.841 --> 02:42:56.245]  You need to recognize that there are Jews, Muslims, Christians, atheists, Buddhists, who are evil people.
[02:42:56.245 --> 02:42:57.026]  This is a big set.
[02:42:57.026 --> 02:42:57.346]  Hold on.
[02:42:57.486 --> 02:42:59.667]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[02:42:59.667 --> 02:43:02.328]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[02:43:02.328 --> 02:43:08.130]  Now, the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[02:43:08.130 --> 02:43:12.632]  The bad news is by Christmas, almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[02:43:12.632 --> 02:43:14.733]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[02:43:14.733 --> 02:43:19.194]  So now is the time to take action to support the InfoWar and get the biggest sales of the year.
[02:43:19.194 --> 02:43:25.117]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and BioTrue Selenium and our Wake Up America award-winning coffee.
[02:43:25.117 --> 02:43:25.437]  And now,
[02:43:25.917 --> 02:43:26.177]  I think so.
[02:43:47.415 --> 02:43:54.100]  Promo code 1776 and you get an additional 10% off the already giant savings at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:55.401]  Thank you so much for your support.
[02:43:55.401 --> 02:43:57.562]  God bless.
[02:43:57.562 --> 02:44:00.924]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[02:44:00.924 --> 02:44:03.746]  Needs to support InfoWars and Banned.Video.
[02:44:03.746 --> 02:44:06.448]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[02:44:06.448 --> 02:44:07.749]  I'm going to do that right now.
[02:44:07.749 --> 02:44:11.652]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[02:44:11.652 --> 02:44:16.555]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[02:44:16.835 --> 02:44:23.018]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[02:44:23.018 --> 02:44:31.642]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[02:44:31.642 --> 02:44:37.164]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[02:44:37.164 --> 02:44:42.747]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[02:44:42.987 --> 02:44:45.468]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[02:44:45.468 --> 02:44:48.170]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[02:44:48.170 --> 02:44:49.651]  So go check out the store.
[02:44:49.651 --> 02:44:50.831]  Go support their store.

[02:44:57.975 --> 02:45:00.196]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[02:45:00.196 --> 02:45:04.218]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[02:45:04.218 --> 02:45:05.539]  There's a solution.

[02:47:25.137 --> 02:47:27.238]  We got some Clockwork Orange music bringing us in here.
[02:47:27.238 --> 02:47:30.180]  Vivian Kubrick, you got caught off by that break, I'm sorry.
[02:47:30.180 --> 02:47:31.281]  We'll try to take it out of context.
[02:47:31.281 --> 02:47:34.483]  Go back to what you were saying and complete the statement.
[02:47:34.483 --> 02:47:43.169]  Alright, so I'm sick of Jewish criminals, Christian criminals, Buddhist criminals, atheist criminals, whatever you are, you're a criminal.
[02:47:43.169 --> 02:47:51.835]  But in this whole thing, the Jewish issue of, you know, claiming people are anti-Semitic if they attack a Jewish criminal,
[02:47:52.455 --> 02:47:53.556]  There are plenty of Jews.
[02:47:53.556 --> 02:47:56.837]  There are like 15.2 million Jews on this planet.
[02:47:56.837 --> 02:47:59.378]  I don't think they want to be associated with George Soros.
[02:47:59.378 --> 02:48:01.899]  George Soros is a criminal and a psychopath.
[02:48:01.899 --> 02:48:09.122]  You only have to listen to his interview where he claims that it was the happiest time of his life when he was handing Jews over to the Nazis.
[02:48:09.122 --> 02:48:10.723]  So he is a nut job.
[02:48:11.423 --> 02:48:26.734]  I have no hesitation in describing him as a criminal, an arch-criminal, and he cannot hide behind anti-Semitism when he claims that it's, or people claim that it's anti-Semitic to say that he's a horrific criminal.
[02:48:27.555 --> 02:48:34.858]  And just as you, you know, there are Christian criminals, if you say that... Yeah, none of them should be able to hide behind a religion or an ethnicity.
[02:48:34.858 --> 02:48:34.958]  No!
[02:48:34.958 --> 02:48:44.581]  But these people are good at making it about that as a diversion, and there are plenty of groups that are out of control that hate people because of what group they've been part of, and that's terrible too.
[02:48:44.581 --> 02:48:48.402]  Well, actually the only group that I think the left won't criticize now is Satanists.
[02:48:48.402 --> 02:48:51.223]  I think that's the most protected class, I think.
[02:48:51.223 --> 02:48:52.464]  The most protected group, I think.
[02:48:53.024 --> 02:48:54.124]  That's a good point.
[02:48:54.124 --> 02:48:55.865]  That is a terrifyingly good point.
[02:48:55.865 --> 02:48:56.405]  No, it's true.
[02:48:56.405 --> 02:49:01.227]  Why do you think that is?
[02:49:01.227 --> 02:49:02.127]  Why do you think it is?
[02:49:02.127 --> 02:49:05.448]  I mean, my docuseries, Best Kept Secret, got into all this, right?
[02:49:05.448 --> 02:49:09.589]  The whole dark cabal and how this is an inversion agenda.
[02:49:09.589 --> 02:49:11.810]  I mean, if you really think about what's happened in our reality,
[02:49:12.250 --> 02:49:14.751]  And, you know, left is right and up is down and black is white.
[02:49:14.751 --> 02:49:18.233]  I mean, that's all Stanton LeVay was talking about that back in the 70s.
[02:49:18.233 --> 02:49:20.034]  That was his quote, you know, freedom is slavery.
[02:49:20.034 --> 02:49:22.636]  I mean, there was a complete inversion of reality.
[02:49:22.636 --> 02:49:33.642]  And to get to this place now where we are in a place where kids can't drink, but they can have a sex change and for the, you know, permanently, you know, castrating themselves, that's normalized.
[02:49:33.642 --> 02:49:38.245]  I mean, you can have abortion up until birth, if not after birth in California.
[02:49:38.945 --> 02:49:43.386]  I mean, things like this that just was like, it was so far, like so far from us.
[02:49:43.386 --> 02:49:45.066]  This really is a satanic revolution.
[02:49:45.066 --> 02:49:45.327]  Right?
[02:49:45.327 --> 02:49:46.687]  It's a really fascinating thing to watch.
[02:49:46.687 --> 02:49:49.087]  That'd be a great book or film, The Satanic Revolution.
[02:49:49.087 --> 02:49:51.508]  Oh, don't, you'll encourage them.
[02:49:51.508 --> 02:49:53.668]  Well, no, we'd expose it, that'd be our film.
[02:49:53.668 --> 02:49:59.850]  Well, I do think that this is... Sean Stone, Vivian Cooper, and Alex Jones in the new top film, The Satanic Revolution.
[02:50:01.206 --> 02:50:03.368]  Oh, they'll probably go, oh, this will be worth watching.
[02:50:03.368 --> 02:50:05.149]  They'll think it's about them in a really nice way.
[02:50:05.149 --> 02:50:12.514]  But explain how they're being set up to be alone and cut off being selfish and how you think the devil's hot cheerleaders or whatever.
[02:50:12.514 --> 02:50:13.235]  But it's not.
[02:50:13.235 --> 02:50:14.836]  It's impoverishment.
[02:50:14.836 --> 02:50:15.496]  It's betrayal.
[02:50:15.496 --> 02:50:16.177]  It's death.
[02:50:16.177 --> 02:50:21.520]  But Alex, this is the most key thing about understanding, let's say, the devil or Satan.
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:25.123]  Let's say it's not even a question of this actually being a real being that lives.
[02:50:25.123 --> 02:50:26.324]  Let's just say... The archetype.
[02:50:26.664 --> 02:50:27.284]  Right.
[02:50:27.284 --> 02:50:30.165]  That what you're dealing with is half-truths.
[02:50:30.165 --> 02:50:45.189]  The only way you can persuade people is if you actually have half of the truth, and in that way you can enslave them, because that's how you... I mean, con artists, the government, the CIA, they always try and hang on... When you're catching a bass, there's a real live worm on the hook.
[02:50:45.868 --> 02:50:48.690]  There has to be something there that's real.
[02:50:48.690 --> 02:50:50.791]  Otherwise you're not going to capture people.
[02:50:50.791 --> 02:50:54.254]  And then what you do is you just keep putting them off.
[02:50:54.254 --> 02:50:57.096]  You just keep navigating them away from the truth.
[02:50:57.096 --> 02:51:02.400]  And then it's only when it's too late and they're caught in a trap, or they're so deluded that they don't... I agree.
[02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:05.362]  What I've noticed is that people who buy lottery tickets are degenerate gamblers.
[02:51:06.325 --> 02:51:09.488]  They're being abused by it, but they keep doubling down because they've invested so much.
[02:51:09.488 --> 02:51:10.209]  Right.
[02:51:10.209 --> 02:51:12.611]  Well, that's a real crazy part of humanity.
[02:51:12.611 --> 02:51:27.527]  I mean, the human condition is that the attempt to be right is so powerful that the defensiveness that comes over people when you even remotely go at the things that they're hanging on to is the truth.
[02:51:27.527 --> 02:51:28.968]  I'm sorry, banging my mic here.
[02:51:30.009 --> 02:51:32.271]  Yeah, is that they get very defensive.
[02:51:32.271 --> 02:51:44.581]  That's why it's a real art to enter into a conversation with, for instance, people who have been fully PSYOPT and gently, you know, get them back into a place where they can differentiate.
[02:51:44.581 --> 02:51:52.007]  And the thing is, I've had this conversation with someone who is very progressive and said, oh, it's not true what you're saying, that they were going to kill babies at birth.
[02:51:52.007 --> 02:51:53.889]  And I said, look, here is this woman.
[02:51:53.889 --> 02:51:55.130]  Here's the legislation.
[02:51:55.430 --> 02:51:56.571]  Well, here's the legislation.
[02:51:56.571 --> 02:51:57.272]  I sent him that.
[02:51:57.272 --> 02:52:05.080]  I said, here's the woman speaking to the court, and the judge says to her, so you're saying that you would actually end the life of a baby after it's born?
[02:52:05.080 --> 02:52:06.541]  And she kept iffing and uffing.
[02:52:06.541 --> 02:52:08.363]  And then he said, well, yeah.
[02:52:08.363 --> 02:52:09.584]  Yeah, that would be what it is.
[02:52:09.584 --> 02:52:13.788]  And the guy said to me, oh, she's just not good at expressing herself.
[02:52:13.788 --> 02:52:14.629]  And I went, what?
[02:52:15.490 --> 02:52:21.584]  She absolutely clearly said, yes, we would consider... That's right, they have like a form of Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:52:21.584 --> 02:52:23.528]  Is it even worth it to try to save those people?
[02:52:23.528 --> 02:52:26.114]  Instead, get the people that are awake just to stop complying?
[02:52:27.625 --> 02:52:28.105]  We have to.
[02:52:28.105 --> 02:52:30.868]  I mean, we have to do something here.
[02:52:30.868 --> 02:52:32.349]  That's clear, right?
[02:52:32.349 --> 02:52:37.313]  And again, I don't know that you can do it with this system the way that it's rigged currently, right?
[02:52:37.313 --> 02:52:50.225]  I mean, that was the most disheartening thing of the last few weeks was just watching 2020 happen all over again with these drawn-out mail-in ballot schemes, right, that's taking days and then obviously, you know, just seeing it, it's inevitable, right?
[02:52:50.225 --> 02:52:53.968]  As you said, you're optimistic because there's a lot of awakening worldwide, but it's paradoxical.
[02:52:54.248 --> 02:53:02.715]  It's extreme.
[02:53:02.715 --> 02:53:07.219]  There has to be a bifurcation coming here, right?
[02:53:07.219 --> 02:53:10.502]  I mean, this letting off of those that want to be in the cities.
[02:53:10.502 --> 02:53:16.087]  I mean, I'm very concerned about things like the graphene oxide in the food also, not just in the shots.
[02:53:16.087 --> 02:53:17.548]  They're bombing everything with nanoparticles.
[02:53:17.768 --> 02:53:18.949]  I mean, it's exactly.
[02:53:18.949 --> 02:53:21.350]  It's in the food supply, the processed foods.
[02:53:21.350 --> 02:53:27.893]  I mean, it's just a question of, look, we've watched them for decades putting this toxicity and spraying it into the air.
[02:53:27.893 --> 02:53:29.894]  People can't even see anymore what chemtrails are.
[02:53:29.894 --> 02:53:32.015]  They just look at the air and just go, oh yeah, it's just clouds.
[02:53:33.776 --> 02:53:36.077]  No one remembers what the heck clouds are supposed to look like.
[02:53:36.077 --> 02:53:38.619]  They just assume that chemtrails are normal.
[02:53:38.619 --> 02:53:40.001]  It's a dwindling spiral.
[02:53:40.001 --> 02:53:42.503]  The more they get poisoned, the more they get separated.
[02:53:42.503 --> 02:53:43.463]  So they're normalizing it.
[02:53:43.463 --> 02:53:44.444]  They're normalizing it.
[02:53:44.444 --> 02:53:44.784]  Exactly.
[02:53:44.784 --> 02:53:48.868]  The poisoning that's taken place in decades, you know, to the place of obviously the opioid epidemic.
[02:53:48.868 --> 02:53:51.550]  I mean, it's just depressing.
[02:53:51.550 --> 02:53:52.831]  And why do they want to kill us?
[02:53:53.491 --> 02:53:54.612]  Yeah, but that's what I was saying before.
[02:53:54.612 --> 02:53:56.193]  These people are insane.
[02:53:56.193 --> 02:53:56.933]  They're psychopathic.
[02:53:56.933 --> 02:53:58.594]  I think spiritually they are bankrupt.
[02:54:13.504 --> 02:54:17.309]  And they're projecting their will to kill themselves onto us.
[02:54:17.309 --> 02:54:19.492]  How do we get them to look in the mirror and just kill themselves?
[02:54:19.492 --> 02:54:20.874]  But I don't want Klaus Schwab to kill himself.
[02:54:20.874 --> 02:54:23.237]  I wish he'd wake up, but obviously he's too far gone.
[02:54:23.237 --> 02:54:28.124]  How do we get Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab to say, it's projection, you need to kill yourself?
[02:54:28.547 --> 02:54:34.875]  Well, actually, I'd be quite satisfied if they just became ineffectual because everybody knew how evil they are.
[02:54:34.875 --> 02:54:46.709]  My terror is that I still see people going, Bill Gates is so wonderful, he cares about us, look at the... Ignoring the fact that 500,000 children in India were maimed and paralyzed by his polio vaccine.
[02:54:46.709 --> 02:54:46.930]  On record!
[02:54:47.290 --> 02:54:56.580]  Yeah, and those gruesome photos of him squeezing God knows what into a little black baby's mouth made me want to... So do you think with their whole rollout, their lockdowns, their poison shot, they got what they want?
[02:54:56.580 --> 02:54:59.603]  Because I see it being rejected way worse than they thought it would.
[02:54:59.603 --> 02:55:01.124]  I think it's been a defeat for them.
[02:55:01.124 --> 02:55:04.348]  It's terrible for all the sick and dead people, but I don't see it going well for them, Sean.
[02:55:04.648 --> 02:55:05.828]  It's not going well for them.
[02:55:05.828 --> 02:55:13.450]  At the same time, it's like what they do is they make their big push and then they roll it back, you know, to about 30% of what it was.
[02:55:13.450 --> 02:55:15.491]  And then it's just like it's a gradualism, right?
[02:55:15.491 --> 02:55:16.971]  That's the whole point of progressivism.
[02:55:16.971 --> 02:55:19.652]  It's progressive takeover of humanity.
[02:55:19.652 --> 02:55:23.693]  And so this has been a hundred year plan as we know now that the place of digital currency.
[02:55:24.273 --> 02:55:26.455]  The digital, the digitization of everything.
[02:55:26.455 --> 02:55:28.516]  So the transhuman thing is inevitable.
[02:55:28.516 --> 02:55:31.018]  That's why even you mentioned about Elon Musk.
[02:55:31.018 --> 02:55:32.399]  It's like, well, he gets it.
[02:55:32.399 --> 02:55:34.220]  He's obviously doing the Neuralink.
[02:55:34.220 --> 02:55:35.361]  Do I think that he's evil?
[02:55:35.361 --> 02:55:36.341]  Is he trying to put in everyone?
[02:55:36.341 --> 02:55:40.384]  No, but I think he also, he's playing in a sense, he's playing with it.
[02:55:40.384 --> 02:55:41.585]  Plus the technology's not bad.
[02:55:41.585 --> 02:55:45.087]  If I'm in a car wreck and paralyzed, I hope he invents something to give me my legs back.
[02:55:45.087 --> 02:55:47.149]  We just don't want the software that controls us in it.
[02:55:47.649 --> 02:55:49.370]  Well, that's the point, exactly.
[02:55:49.370 --> 02:55:53.632]  It's like if you lost your legs, of course you want to be able to replace it.
[02:55:53.632 --> 02:56:04.897]  But do we want to then ultimately be the robots that they are envisioning of as far as the transhuman thing where, oh, I'm going to genetically splice my child and alter my child because that's going to make a perfect human?
[02:56:04.897 --> 02:56:06.237]  No, this doesn't work that way.
[02:56:06.237 --> 02:56:12.840]  Which takes us back to Childhood End and Arthur C. Clarke, a top Illuminist, where, yeah, you're going to live forever, but you're going to give your body up and we're going to be controlled by us.
[02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:15.062]  Well, I don't even think that they'll achieve it.
[02:56:15.062 --> 02:56:21.990]  I think that the technology will never be perfected because you're playing with nature, which is much more perfect, right?
[02:56:21.990 --> 02:56:25.815]  Nature understands things that this human alteration can't.
[02:56:25.815 --> 02:56:30.600]  So the more that we play God, as we know, it creates monstrosities, right?
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:31.081]  It's inevitable.
[02:56:31.141 --> 02:56:38.603]  And then the big, you can't say a man can't be a woman in the future when they claim, oh, he's uploaded his consciousness, Bob's still alive.
[02:56:38.603 --> 02:56:42.385]  If you say that's not really Bob in the computer, you're hurting his identity, you get arrested.
[02:56:42.385 --> 02:56:44.365]  But really, Bob didn't live eternally.
[02:56:44.365 --> 02:56:47.606]  The corporation sold him that, but it's a fraud.
[02:56:47.606 --> 02:56:48.466]  I think it'll be a fraud.
[02:56:48.466 --> 02:56:52.948]  I don't think that you can take the human spirit and transmit and put it into a robot.
[02:56:52.948 --> 02:56:54.068]  I don't believe that.
[02:56:54.068 --> 02:56:59.310]  Well, I've met with top globalists and they admit that's their endgame, is that we're going to live in computers and that we're going to have to accept that.
[02:57:00.086 --> 02:57:03.029]  Yeah, to me it won't work because the spirit is connected to the body.
[02:57:03.029 --> 02:57:03.309]  Absolutely.
[02:57:03.309 --> 02:57:05.351]  Physical, natural, physical experience.
[02:57:05.351 --> 02:57:08.013]  It's an electrochemical machine that it's in.
[02:57:08.013 --> 02:57:08.534]  Right, exactly.
[02:57:08.534 --> 02:57:11.256]  And all we are is really an antenna to the dimensions.
[02:57:11.256 --> 02:57:12.598]  This is just an antenna.
[02:57:12.598 --> 02:57:12.838]  Right.
[02:57:12.838 --> 02:57:15.740]  So they can't make the antenna, the antenna's just dialing in.
[02:57:15.740 --> 02:57:21.326]  Yeah, no, even with the silicon machine or graphene oxide or whatnot, it's not going to be...
[02:57:22.366 --> 02:57:23.027]  Stay with us.
[02:57:47.907 --> 02:57:59.375]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[02:57:59.375 --> 02:58:03.838]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[02:58:03.838 --> 02:58:07.801]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[02:58:07.801 --> 02:58:11.443]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[02:58:11.443 --> 02:58:12.564]  You see, the sun
[02:58:14.045 --> 02:58:14.345]  We're good to
[02:58:38.385 --> 02:58:42.846]  Ladies and gentlemen, we always run the biggest deals of the year starting in mid-November through Christmas.
[02:58:42.846 --> 02:58:45.007]  But this year is hands down the biggest sale we've ever offered.
[02:58:45.007 --> 02:58:46.788]  Not just up to 60% off with promo code 1776.
[02:59:03.433 --> 02:59:09.238]  But on top of it, double Patriot points and what makes this the most special sale ever.
[02:59:09.238 --> 02:59:13.702]  Every order will get a free gift, no matter how small or how big.
[02:59:13.702 --> 02:59:18.086]  And it's all randomly selected by the shopping cart computer.
[02:59:18.086 --> 02:59:20.389]  So you might order a sticker pack for $5.
[02:59:20.389 --> 02:59:26.294]  You might order the blowout t-shirt sale for $4.95 and then get something worth $50, $60, $70, $80, $100.
[02:59:28.596 --> 02:59:31.317]  So, again, some of the gifts are sticker-packed.
[02:59:31.317 --> 02:59:32.858]  Some of them are Alex Jones Halloween masks.
[02:59:32.858 --> 02:59:37.421]  Some of them are books, films, InfoWars flags, American flags.
[02:59:37.421 --> 02:59:39.161]  There are hundreds of different items.
[02:59:39.161 --> 02:59:40.362]  It's all random.
[02:59:40.362 --> 02:59:41.883]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:41.883 --> 02:59:44.104]  Every order gets a free gift.
[02:59:44.104 --> 02:59:49.667]  Free gifts with every order at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:49.667 --> 02:59:55.570]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:26.229 --> 03:00:35.935]  But think about the power of that, that you are all your ancestors going back to the unknown eons, and you are the leading edge of all their consciousness and their will.
[03:00:35.935 --> 03:00:47.423]  And obviously their energy lives on in other dimensions, but we're not just conduits here personally now, we are part of a great genetic and psychic and spiritual and energetic trust.
[03:00:48.854 --> 03:00:54.260]  Can I offer a little bit of a clue that maybe they can get into a machine?
[03:00:54.260 --> 03:00:55.861]  Alright, now wait.
[03:00:55.861 --> 03:01:11.017]  So, if any of you have watched paranormal shows, you'll see that there's all this extraordinary evidence of disembodied in another dimension communicating either as apparitions in front of people or when they're recorded, it's called electronic voice phenomena.
[03:01:11.657 --> 03:01:13.359]  So, maybe they know a lot.
[03:01:13.359 --> 03:01:19.365]  We all know the CIA did, like, remote viewing, as did the KGB, or whatever it was, training people to do remote viewing.
[03:01:19.365 --> 03:01:21.086]  So they obviously believe in spirit.
[03:01:21.980 --> 03:01:32.963]  So, is it more to do with them defying God and wanting to be, you know, more, uh, powerful, and they're gonna demonstrate to God that they can, like, outperform Him?
[03:01:32.963 --> 03:01:43.386]  Um, or are they actually taking something that's real, but because they're psychopaths and insane, they're doing something horrendous with it, which is like, you know, I mean,
[03:01:43.746 --> 03:01:45.267]  No, I agree, they're trying to be God.
[03:01:45.267 --> 03:01:50.130]  Yeah, and they're inviting people to commit suicide, saying, hey, it'll be really great, you know, you've got a really screwed up body.
[03:01:50.130 --> 03:01:56.495]  Well, you can upload your mind into this thing, and I just feel they're using that as a way for people to knock them, you know, kill themselves.
[03:01:56.495 --> 03:01:58.196]  To make their free will to go into that dimension.
[03:01:58.196 --> 03:02:04.040]  They're not even really in the machine, but that's more like an archetype and a symbol of them in a ritual agreeing to go with that energy.
[03:02:04.460 --> 03:02:08.601]  Well, and to kill themselves, because this seems to be like the death cult of all death cults.
[03:02:08.601 --> 03:02:11.462]  They want to kill little babies, they want people to commit suicide.
[03:02:11.462 --> 03:02:15.944]  What they don't want you to do is pass on your genetic information, absolutely.
[03:02:15.944 --> 03:02:16.264]  Why?
[03:02:16.264 --> 03:02:16.904]  Why?
[03:02:16.904 --> 03:02:20.585]  Because they know it's going to end up creating something beautiful they can't stop.
[03:02:20.585 --> 03:02:23.566]  Oh, yes, that is a good, good answer.
[03:02:23.956 --> 03:02:30.697]  I mean, control is very much the endgame, right, of what these sociopaths or psychopaths are after.
[03:02:30.697 --> 03:02:33.718]  They want to control this dimension completely.
[03:02:33.718 --> 03:02:40.399]  That's why I think we were talking about the poisoning of the environment, you know, using the chemtrails, the chemicals, the heavy metals that are being sprayed, right?
[03:02:40.399 --> 03:02:42.259]  It's an assault on the third dimension.
[03:02:42.259 --> 03:02:49.701]  Well, it's an assault on the third dimension to be able to basically, the more you can metallicize it, the more you can then broadcast whatever frequencies you want, like, and they live, right?
[03:02:50.681 --> 03:02:51.642]  Metallicize, yeah.
[03:02:51.642 --> 03:02:53.983]  Yeah, that's what the nanotech is, replicating everybody.
[03:02:53.983 --> 03:02:54.724]  Right, right.
[03:02:54.724 --> 03:02:56.305]  They're putting the plugs into us.
[03:02:56.305 --> 03:02:59.067]  So Sean Stone, how do we beat them?
[03:02:59.067 --> 03:03:09.573]  Get back to nature, connect to, you know, detox your system, keep, you know, cleaning out your mind and your body and your spirit and just basically honor the Creator, you know, because that's it.
[03:03:09.573 --> 03:03:14.257]  This is, this creation is of the Creator and we are still, we are all expressions of it, living expressions of it.
[03:03:14.257 --> 03:03:14.737]  So to honor
[03:03:15.017 --> 03:03:15.317]  I think so.
[03:03:36.033 --> 03:03:37.734]  They're all into like S&M kind of things.
[03:03:37.734 --> 03:03:43.616]  They want to be beaten or they want children because they themselves are so, they hate themselves so much.
[03:03:43.616 --> 03:03:45.537]  They're so wretched inside.
[03:03:45.537 --> 03:03:47.278]  And it's a demonic energy ultimately.
[03:03:47.278 --> 03:03:49.258]  It's such a low vibrational energy.
[03:03:49.258 --> 03:03:59.062]  So the more that we that are aware, awakening, can basically come into a place of more self-love, more self-awareness, more self-respect, then we respect others the same way, right?
[03:03:59.062 --> 03:03:59.542]  Well, that's true.
[03:03:59.542 --> 03:04:01.563]  The revolution is us changing ourselves individually.
[03:04:01.563 --> 03:04:02.284]  That will change the world.
[03:04:03.700 --> 03:04:15.905]  And that's where you have to take responsibility for yourself, learn how to differentiate and examine and expect information that you're being told, and bother to see if there's grotesque contradictions.
[03:04:15.905 --> 03:04:21.007]  I mean, because that's part of their hypocrisy, is they accuse you of the very thing they're doing.
[03:04:21.007 --> 03:04:22.827]  I actually think that's a technique.
[03:04:22.827 --> 03:04:28.329]  But they actually, they try to force you to have an opinion that they give you.
[03:04:28.329 --> 03:04:32.151]  And if you're not on your guard, you may actually take on that opinion.
[03:04:32.631 --> 03:04:36.133]  It actually takes work to be a responsible being.
[03:04:36.133 --> 03:04:41.816]  You actually have to really go, wow, I'm not going to immediately jump when they say jump.
[03:04:41.816 --> 03:04:45.518]  I'm going to look at this, which is what I did when this whole COVID thing began.
[03:04:45.518 --> 03:04:48.179]  And by the way, I want to really acknowledge this.
[03:04:48.179 --> 03:04:54.543]  Alex, you and your guests, I would guess, saved millions of people by giving them the right information.
[03:04:54.543 --> 03:04:56.364]  Let's talk about that because the next attack's coming.
[03:04:58.533 --> 03:05:04.510]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[03:05:05.808 --> 03:05:16.196]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[03:05:16.196 --> 03:05:28.925]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[03:05:29.605 --> 03:05:41.107]  Treatment packages specifically for COVID, post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes, and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[03:05:41.107 --> 03:05:49.308]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health advice.
[03:05:49.308 --> 03:05:57.470]  Come see The Wellness Company and go to OnlineHealthNow.com as a conduit to The Wellness Company.
[03:06:01.758 --> 03:06:06.765]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:06:06.765 --> 03:06:08.268]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:23.334 --> 03:06:29.038]  Alex Jones here back live, final segment with our guest Sean Stone, Vivian Kubrick, and then the great Jay Dyer to run a research for the New World Order.
[03:06:29.038 --> 03:06:32.481]  He takes over in about 10 minutes, 15 minutes or so.
[03:06:32.481 --> 03:06:38.586]  But yes, the audience, the crew, our guest, this whole operation deserves the credit she was getting into that.
[03:06:39.346 --> 03:06:46.470]  Of being the very tip of the spear exposing the virus out of the lab, the lockdowns being a fraud, the poison shot, which is why it's so important we stay on air.
[03:06:46.470 --> 03:07:01.218]  This whole community, it's not about credit, it's about recognizing we've been right and that they're trying to do new lockdowns, new injections, world IDs, global passports to travel, even leave your house.
[03:07:01.218 --> 03:07:02.419]  And so Vivian, finish up your point.
[03:07:02.847 --> 03:07:10.729]  Well, I think it's incredibly important because this is what we're pushing back against are the lies about Infowars and the lies about Alex.
[03:07:10.729 --> 03:07:15.411]  Is that Alex, his guests, his crew, everyone here have a mission.
[03:07:15.411 --> 03:07:18.512]  A mission to set humanity free and to get...
[03:07:19.312 --> 03:07:26.138]  The people that are criminally crushing humanity, killing them at this point, culling them.
[03:07:26.138 --> 03:07:38.628]  You're not going to get the information that you need in order to protect yourself and to understand what's being done to you, probably from anywhere else that has such a vast audience as InfoWars.
[03:07:38.628 --> 03:07:44.933]  So I believe that I know that when COVID happened, I just moved back from Florida to Texas,
[03:07:45.493 --> 03:07:46.754]  And I was just wobbling around.
[03:07:46.754 --> 03:07:47.534]  I wasn't paying attention.
[03:07:47.534 --> 03:07:49.655]  I walked into the supermarket and everything had gone.
[03:07:49.655 --> 03:07:50.976]  And I said, what's happened?
[03:07:50.976 --> 03:07:53.217]  They said, haven't you heard about COVID?
[03:07:53.217 --> 03:07:54.577]  And I went, no.
[03:07:54.577 --> 03:07:56.418]  And I turned on Alex.
[03:07:56.418 --> 03:08:01.940]  And then immediately you were talking to Frances Boyle, Dr. Frances Boyle, Professor, Doctor, whatever, Frances Boyle.
[03:08:01.940 --> 03:08:07.363]  And from the moment that you started reporting about it and having guests, you completely educated me.
[03:08:07.363 --> 03:08:10.024]  It let me go and find the documents myself.
[03:08:10.024 --> 03:08:11.705]  It let me think about what was going on.
[03:08:12.245 --> 03:08:27.036]  And then when I went to the supermarket and people were standing obediently six feet apart and having hysterics of anyone like pulled their mask down, it gave me the freedom to observe what was happening instead of getting pulled into the hysteria.
[03:08:27.036 --> 03:08:31.739]  And the one thing they want people to be is hysterical and frightened and waiting for the next interaction.
[03:08:31.739 --> 03:08:32.119]  Well, that's right.
[03:08:32.119 --> 03:08:35.182]  Well, the enemy is, this is our real brain trust with our guests and the whole family.
[03:08:35.882 --> 03:08:43.574]  Is that we did dead on 100% nail what they were doing from previous research, which shows we can beat them again when they try it again.
[03:08:43.574 --> 03:08:44.275]  But that wasn't us.
[03:08:44.275 --> 03:08:48.100]  That was just studying the globalists who think we're so dumb they admit.
[03:08:48.100 --> 03:08:51.666]  Why do the globalists admit Sean Stone is so much we're going to do before they do it?
[03:08:52.742 --> 03:08:56.043]  Predictive programming, because I think there's two aspects.
[03:08:56.043 --> 03:08:59.704]  You touch upon this a lot, where everything has to be disclosed at some level, right?
[03:08:59.704 --> 03:09:03.865]  There has to be a certain level of transparency, even if people don't believe it, right?
[03:09:03.865 --> 03:09:08.726]  Because if sometimes you say, hey, I'm going to punch you, and then you actually do it, people still don't believe it.
[03:09:08.726 --> 03:09:11.526]  They say, oh, no, wait a minute, that must have been something else.
[03:09:11.526 --> 03:09:21.829]  But there is this sort of spiritual law around revealing things, and then there is the predictive programming, which you could say is also designed to get people to
[03:09:23.215 --> 03:09:25.317]  To respond the way you want them to respond, right?
[03:09:25.317 --> 03:09:30.182]  So you put out movies like that Soderbergh film that was ridiculously bad about the pandemic, right?
[03:09:30.182 --> 03:09:31.143]  That was done a few years ago.
[03:09:31.143 --> 03:09:31.944]  What was the name of it?
[03:09:31.944 --> 03:09:32.825]  Do you remember?
[03:09:32.825 --> 03:09:39.251]  Soderbergh made it with, uh, anyway, with Jude Law and all his people in this, and how the CDC is racing to save everyone from this deadly new virus.
[03:09:39.251 --> 03:09:41.613]  Oh yeah, they even had a movie right before it came out that showed it, yeah.
[03:09:41.653 --> 03:09:47.116]  Well, it came out a few years ago and then the point was that like when the lockdown started, all these people going, Oh, it's trending on Netflix.
[03:09:47.116 --> 03:09:55.501]  Everyone's going to watch this movie again, you know, because it's, it's this, it's basically telling you how they want you to respond, how they want you to perceive the CDC as the savior.
[03:09:55.501 --> 03:09:57.902]  They want you to perceive the government as the good guys.
[03:09:57.902 --> 03:09:58.082]  Right.
[03:09:58.082 --> 03:10:01.024]  And that's a lot of the films in general that we've seen across time.
[03:10:01.024 --> 03:10:01.224]  Right.
[03:10:01.224 --> 03:10:11.049]  So consistently this idea of, you know, the good guys and, you know, in the UN or whatever, and, you know, in the good CIA, and then like, there's a one rogue bad CIA guy, but the CIA in general is good.
[03:10:11.149 --> 03:10:25.237]  I mean, this is the same narrative that gets pushed across over and over to just get people to really be docile in a sense, to not think for themselves, to not realize that the government is not your friend and has, again, has become this behemoth.
[03:10:25.237 --> 03:10:27.679]  You know what's interesting about the federal government?
[03:10:27.679 --> 03:10:28.299]  It's about 40% of our GDP.
[03:10:30.083 --> 03:10:33.584]  Do you realize what that means to our reality?
[03:10:33.584 --> 03:10:37.505]  The federal government is 40% of our GDP as a nation.
[03:10:37.505 --> 03:10:38.945]  Think about that.
[03:10:38.945 --> 03:10:42.286]  All this spending, all the military, industrial complex, so-called, but it's everything.
[03:10:42.286 --> 03:10:43.146]  It's pharma.
[03:10:43.146 --> 03:10:45.487]  Everything is spending money from the government.
[03:10:45.487 --> 03:10:47.267]  And so in closing, let me raise that.
[03:10:47.267 --> 03:10:49.788]  The big front and center threat is Zelensky.
[03:10:49.788 --> 03:10:51.048]  I don't like the Russians invading.
[03:10:51.048 --> 03:10:52.089]  I'm not choosing a side.
[03:10:53.789 --> 03:10:54.769]  NATO started the war.
[03:10:54.769 --> 03:10:56.150]  They overthrew the government eight years ago.
[03:10:56.150 --> 03:10:56.650]  We all know that.
[03:10:56.650 --> 03:11:01.211]  Your dad made great films exposing it way before predicting it would all happen.
[03:11:01.211 --> 03:11:04.112]  But now they fire a missile 100 miles out of bounds.
[03:11:04.112 --> 03:11:06.092]  I say it's an anti-aircraft missile.
[03:11:06.092 --> 03:11:07.232]  They later confirm it.
[03:11:07.232 --> 03:11:08.373]  The Pentagon says it doesn't matter.
[03:11:08.373 --> 03:11:09.873]  It's still Russia's fault.
[03:11:09.873 --> 03:11:15.815]  And Zelensky calls for Article 5 to be invoked and NATO to attack Russia, which will lead to nuclear war.
[03:11:15.815 --> 03:11:17.015]  These people are out of their minds.
[03:11:17.315 --> 03:11:18.275]  Yeah, well, we know this.
[03:11:18.275 --> 03:11:19.436]  I mean, why haven't they gone for peace?
[03:11:19.436 --> 03:11:25.298]  I mean, the point was that we could have had a peace deal pretty quickly during, you know, right after the invasion.
[03:11:25.298 --> 03:11:28.799]  There was opportunity for peace, and Zelensky and company pulled out, right?
[03:11:28.799 --> 03:11:29.899]  And so, and the U.S.
[03:11:29.899 --> 03:11:31.800]  has not pushed for peace since that time.
[03:11:31.800 --> 03:11:39.562]  So here, you know, even Russell Brand is making fun of Biden, going, this guy is sitting there like an old man on the side of the porch going, you know, if we stay on this course, there's going to be a nuclear war.
[03:11:39.562 --> 03:11:40.983]  It's like, why don't you do something about it?
[03:11:40.983 --> 03:11:42.623]  Maybe, you know, maybe move towards peace.
[03:11:42.623 --> 03:11:43.584]  Why don't you?
[03:11:43.584 --> 03:11:44.504]  It's, they're insane.
[03:11:44.784 --> 03:11:46.304]  And people take it as a Russian loss.
[03:11:46.304 --> 03:11:48.745]  They've got 100,000 dead troops, reportedly 100,000 dead Ukrainians.
[03:11:48.745 --> 03:11:49.185]  No.
[03:11:49.185 --> 03:11:52.046]  This is a real giant war in Europe.
[03:11:52.046 --> 03:11:54.206]  This has got to stop.
[03:11:54.206 --> 03:11:57.827]  I mean, without question, war is slaughter.
[03:11:57.827 --> 03:12:08.089]  War is what they need when they want to create chaos and do more controlling, and another way to disguise the central bankers and their incredible irresponsibility.
[03:12:08.922 --> 03:12:08.962]  No.
[03:12:37.766 --> 03:12:44.151]  By the way, I just want to really say it again, or say, expand on this.
[03:12:44.151 --> 03:12:48.734]  You've got to teach yourself about the technology of psyops.
[03:12:48.734 --> 03:12:53.097]  Because unless you understand how it works, you're going to be vulnerable to it.
[03:12:53.097 --> 03:12:57.821]  And there are certainly many places that you can find information about psyops.
[03:12:57.821 --> 03:13:00.643]  But if you also look at the history of psychiatry,
[03:13:01.383 --> 03:13:09.188]  And Edward Bernays, and the ways in which spies are taught how to be spies.
[03:13:09.188 --> 03:13:15.032]  You're going to understand more about how you're being manipulated, so that you can catch it when it happens.
[03:13:15.032 --> 03:13:21.876]  I mean, most of us are kind and good-hearted people, so... That's right, if you're not aware that there's a war on for your mind, you're basically gonna lose.
[03:13:21.876 --> 03:13:23.777]  That's right, that's right.
[03:13:23.777 --> 03:13:24.278]  Exactly.
[03:13:24.278 --> 03:13:27.700]  Which is another reason why InfoWars is so incredibly important.
[03:13:28.288 --> 03:13:30.489]  Well, I appreciate you guys.
[03:13:30.489 --> 03:13:43.517]  What I'm happy about is I see so many great new talk show hosts and other talk show hosts really waking up that now, you know, because Sean's been doing this forever, so have I. You've obviously been awake a long time, Vivian, but there's so many new people popping up.
[03:13:43.517 --> 03:13:45.378]  I don't think their attempt to shut this down is going to work.
[03:13:45.638 --> 03:13:50.339]  No, it's like every time they take one out, a hundred are born and it metastasizes, right?
[03:13:50.339 --> 03:13:51.600]  And that's the beauty of this thing.
[03:13:51.600 --> 03:14:00.962]  It's like the more that, oh, we censor one, a thousand, you know, you end up with, look, Rumble and BitchTube have popped up ever since YouTube started banning, you know, conspiracy theorists, right?
[03:14:00.962 --> 03:14:11.825]  So it's just an inevitability of human consciousness that the more they try to target and censor, the more it actually leads to more people waking up and going, hey, maybe Kyrie is right, you know, maybe Kanye is right, right?
[03:14:11.825 --> 03:14:14.446]  And that's the key, is evil always loses.
[03:14:14.966 --> 03:14:22.989]  And it doesn't mean we're perfect in our resistance to it, but we're trying to be good, trying to find a real future for everybody, and we're not going to be happy until we do that.
[03:14:22.989 --> 03:14:25.930]  Sean, you've got best-selling books, you've got films, everything.
[03:14:25.930 --> 03:14:27.611]  How do people find all your great work?
[03:14:27.611 --> 03:14:27.971]  Absolutely.
[03:14:27.971 --> 03:14:30.772]  SeanStone.info, that's the best place to go.
[03:14:30.772 --> 03:14:32.953]  Best Kept Secret is a must-watch docuseries.
[03:14:32.953 --> 03:14:34.914]  If you want to talk about PsyOps, it's in there.
[03:14:34.914 --> 03:14:38.095]  And your book about the Anglo-American establishment couldn't be out at a better time?
[03:14:38.095 --> 03:14:39.495]  The New World Order is available.
[03:14:39.495 --> 03:14:43.497]  I think you guys have it too from InfoWars, and everything is available through SeanStone.info.
[03:14:44.638 --> 03:14:46.079]  And Vivian, you're quite the enigma.
[03:14:46.079 --> 03:14:48.020]  I mean, I've been a big fan of your dad.
[03:14:48.020 --> 03:14:52.183]  Before I ever met you, I knew you worked on a lot of his films and the music for Full Metal Jacket.
[03:14:52.183 --> 03:14:56.626]  Getting to know you in the last 15 years has been great, and so I'm very honored that you come on my show and Sean's show.
[03:14:56.626 --> 03:14:59.048]  Isn't that about it?
[03:14:59.048 --> 03:14:59.368]  Sorry, what?
[03:14:59.368 --> 03:15:00.289]  I mean, how many shows do you do?
[03:15:00.289 --> 03:15:01.089]  You only go on a few shows.
[03:15:01.089 --> 03:15:05.152]  No, I think I can count it on one hand, and most of it is with you.
[03:15:05.152 --> 03:15:06.753]  Well, we're very honored to have you.
[03:15:06.753 --> 03:15:09.155]  Jay Dyer is about to take over, Vivian.
[03:15:09.155 --> 03:15:10.036]  30-second closing comment.
[03:15:10.649 --> 03:15:16.655]  Uh, just that if you want to find me, I'm on Gab at V-I-K-U 1111.
[03:15:16.655 --> 03:15:18.536]  So, V-I-K-U 1111.
[03:15:18.536 --> 03:15:23.041]  And next time you're on, hopefully come on soon, we'll put the lower third up.
[03:15:23.041 --> 03:15:24.662]  Say it one more time, people are going to be calling us.
[03:15:24.662 --> 03:15:25.323]  How do they find you?
[03:15:26.003 --> 03:15:32.646]  I'm on Gab because I got chucked off Twitter for saying that COVID was 97.7% non-lethal.
[03:15:32.646 --> 03:15:37.729]  Although, I now recently got a letter saying that I'll never be allowed back on because I broke too many rules.
[03:15:37.729 --> 03:15:40.690]  And they're never going to speak to me again, and they're never going to answer my emails.
[03:15:40.690 --> 03:15:41.751]  Well, they sure taught you.
[03:15:41.751 --> 03:15:44.912]  Now you're on the air reaching probably 3 million people watching right now.
[03:15:44.912 --> 03:15:46.793]  So Vivian Kubrick, search her on Gab.
[03:15:46.793 --> 03:15:49.214]  All right, the great Jade Iron takes over straight ahead.
[03:15:49.214 --> 03:15:51.155]  John Stone, Vivian Kubrick, thank you so much.
[03:15:51.155 --> 03:15:52.036]  Bye, everyone.
[03:15:52.036 --> 03:15:53.476]  All right, everybody, have a great weekend.
[03:15:53.476 --> 03:15:54.697]  Owen Schwerer comes up in 45 minutes.
[03:15:57.196 --> 03:15:57.716]  Look at that.
[03:15:57.716 --> 03:16:02.700]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear and that's because it's been denatured, it's been watered down.
[03:16:02.700 --> 03:16:03.800]  We didn't do that.
[03:16:05.451 --> 03:16:09.972]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get?
[03:16:09.972 --> 03:16:12.213]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[03:16:12.213 --> 03:16:21.236]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[03:16:21.236 --> 03:16:22.976]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[03:16:22.976 --> 03:16:24.777]  Don't you get the big secret?
[03:16:24.777 --> 03:16:27.318]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[03:16:27.318 --> 03:16:29.198]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[03:16:29.198 --> 03:16:31.979]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[03:16:39.682 --> 03:16:41.163]  Look it up.
[03:16:41.163 --> 03:16:43.705]  Find out.
[03:16:43.705 --> 03:16:47.188]  How even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[03:16:47.188 --> 03:16:52.512]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[03:16:52.512 --> 03:16:55.615]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in forestore.com.
[03:16:56.866 --> 03:17:08.889]  As an all-star fighter, businessman, motivational speaker, and philanthropist, Andrew Tate has truly earned the title of Top G. But there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has enraged the globalists.
[03:17:08.889 --> 03:17:14.311]  He is consecutively the most Googled man in the world in the last two years.
[03:17:14.311 --> 03:17:18.912]  And that's because his message is about human, and specifically, male empowerment.
[03:17:19.392 --> 03:17:25.656]  Now, Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.
[03:17:25.656 --> 03:17:28.618]  Introducing Top G Supplements.
[03:17:28.618 --> 03:17:33.881]  We are proud to introduce and sponsor the Top G line of supplements by Andrew Tate and his crew.
[03:17:33.881 --> 03:17:39.885]  Now you have the chance to benefit in body, mind, and soul with the same supplements that Andrew Tate takes himself.
[03:17:39.885 --> 03:17:43.507]  Learn more about these amazing products at andrewtatepower.com.
[03:17:44.668 --> 03:17:49.457]  AndrewTatePower.com and discover the power of Andrew Tate's new supplements.
[03:17:49.457 --> 03:17:51.261]  They're the highest quality on the market.
[03:17:51.261 --> 03:17:52.202]  Men grow up to be like me.
[03:17:52.202 --> 03:17:57.152]  You're gonna have a whole bunch of people with no criminal record, dedicated athletes, who protect and provide for the people close to them.
[03:17:58.721 --> 03:18:01.203]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[03:18:01.203 --> 03:18:02.485]  Why is this taking so long?
[03:18:02.485 --> 03:18:05.968]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[03:18:05.968 --> 03:18:07.249]  Why can't we do this here?
[03:18:07.249 --> 03:18:09.792]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[03:18:09.792 --> 03:18:15.637]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[03:18:15.797 --> 03:18:17.619]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[03:18:17.619 --> 03:18:19.540]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[03:18:19.540 --> 03:18:21.462]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[03:18:21.462 --> 03:18:32.050]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America First majority in every single one of them.
[03:18:32.050 --> 03:18:36.193]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[03:18:36.193 --> 03:18:39.095]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[03:18:39.095 --> 03:18:41.257]  Communications are the reason why we didn't well.
[03:18:41.497 --> 03:18:45.178]  That's why Infowars.com is so damn important.
[03:18:45.178 --> 03:18:48.519]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[03:18:48.519 --> 03:18:50.740]  People need to get behind Infowars.
[03:18:50.740 --> 03:18:56.001]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[03:18:56.001 --> 03:18:58.902]  We need more of this communications, not less.
[03:18:58.902 --> 03:19:09.965]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[03:19:10.205 --> 03:19:12.107]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[03:19:12.107 --> 03:19:13.568]  That's what they want to take away.
[03:19:13.568 --> 03:19:15.089]  Your ability to speak freely.
[03:19:15.089 --> 03:19:16.811]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[03:19:16.811 --> 03:19:18.052]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[03:19:18.052 --> 03:19:19.893]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[03:19:19.893 --> 03:19:22.515]  I studied The Globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years.
[03:19:22.515 --> 03:19:24.737]  And I knew they were planning all of this.
[03:19:24.737 --> 03:19:27.119]  And I warned the public, as a modern Paul Revere.
[03:19:27.119 --> 03:19:29.141]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[03:19:29.141 --> 03:19:36.087]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to The Globalist agenda.
[03:19:36.727 --> 03:19:42.110]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[03:19:42.110 --> 03:19:51.056]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsTore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[03:19:51.056 --> 03:19:58.420]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsTore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[03:19:58.420 --> 03:20:04.324]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:14.370 --> 03:20:15.350]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:15.350 --> 03:20:17.891]  I'm your guest, this is Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:20:17.891 --> 03:20:26.373]  I was listening to Vivian and Sean give their analysis of the way that we understand how the global power structure works.
[03:20:26.373 --> 03:20:30.694]  I was really happy to hear them referring to organized crime and the structure of organized crime.
[03:20:30.694 --> 03:20:36.075]  I gave an interview this week on one of the largest true crime channels on YouTube, Sean Atwood.
[03:20:36.075 --> 03:20:37.055]  Shout out to Sean Atwood.
[03:20:37.575 --> 03:20:45.001]  We had a whole 30-minute discussion of the history of organized crime, how that ties into the assassination of JFK, most likely.
[03:20:45.001 --> 03:20:48.824]  That's one of the prevalent theories that seems to have the most evidence behind it.
[03:20:48.824 --> 03:20:58.631]  Of course, I think there's other power players as well behind the assassination of JFK, including intelligence agencies, including foreign governments, as well as organized crime and the mob.
[03:20:59.532 --> 03:21:12.437]  And I wanted to review a little bit of that because that's one of the first things I discussed in the fourth hour two years ago on the Alex Jones Show, having been hosting the fourth hour now for two years, a little over two years.
[03:21:12.437 --> 03:21:15.798]  Because this week it was big, big, big news.
[03:21:15.798 --> 03:21:17.319]  This huge dynamic.
[03:21:17.858 --> 03:21:18.398]  We're good.
[03:21:33.329 --> 03:21:33.970]  We're good to go.
[03:21:49.341 --> 03:22:04.647]  And then we have this sudden emerging thing on the scene with the face of the quasi-autistic, afro-minded man-boob figure of Sam Bankman Freed, who's supposedly this genius that nobody, you know, he's way beyond everybody.
[03:22:04.647 --> 03:22:08.849]  He sleeps on a beanbag in his office and he's got floppy hair.
[03:22:10.419 --> 03:22:17.527]  He just happens to be best friends with Bill Clinton and they're so close and it's just all gonna be wonderful with all this crypto.
[03:22:17.527 --> 03:22:18.768]  And then what do we know?
[03:22:18.768 --> 03:22:19.589]  Shocker!
[03:22:19.589 --> 03:22:25.075]  It's a big, huge, bigger than Enron scam!
[03:22:25.075 --> 03:22:32.883]  And he's still tweeting, he's still trying to explain himself as this altruistic billionaire who wants to give all of his money away.
[03:22:33.752 --> 03:22:46.496]  As he lives together with a goblin-faced creature, supposedly his, quote, girlfriend, that they all sleep together in a giant orgy with ten people living in an apartment complex.
[03:22:46.496 --> 03:22:47.416]  I mean, come on.
[03:22:47.416 --> 03:22:50.137]  Does anybody really believe that this guy was running this?
[03:22:50.137 --> 03:22:55.019]  Well, it turns out, as if you listen to BitBoy's interviews, BitBoy has dug really deep into this.
[03:22:55.019 --> 03:22:59.480]  I think Owen had BitBoy on, and they talked about the background to this whole scandal.
[03:22:59.480 --> 03:23:02.101]  And over on BitBoy's channel, he's gone into depth with
[03:23:02.788 --> 03:23:11.434]  Other people who, this Friedberg character who was involved in a famous early 2000s online poker scam.
[03:23:11.434 --> 03:23:18.159]  And so it seems like they sort of recruited in these people who had a history of running high-level scams.
[03:23:18.159 --> 03:23:29.667]  And this was pumped up to the nth degree with all of these Hollywood people, all of these stars, all these famous people pointing out how amazing FTX was, the FTX token, all this stuff.
[03:23:29.667 --> 03:23:31.609]  And it was, and people are shocked
[03:23:32.370 --> 03:23:37.813]  At how fraudulent and fake all of this is turning out to be.
[03:23:37.813 --> 03:23:38.374]  Yes, there you go.
[03:23:38.374 --> 03:23:44.817]  Would you like to join these two in a round of coitus?
[03:23:44.817 --> 03:23:46.758]  I know everybody's tempted in the audience.
[03:23:46.758 --> 03:23:49.420]  Try to hold back your temptation there.
[03:23:49.420 --> 03:23:53.022]  Let's go take a cold shower real quick if you need to.
[03:23:53.022 --> 03:23:57.945]  If you're giving in to your base passions right now, but I'm just joking.
[03:23:57.945 --> 03:24:01.387]  This is no shocker because as I'm listening to everybody talking about
[03:24:02.034 --> 03:24:03.696]  It's a Ponzi scheme.
[03:24:03.696 --> 03:24:04.937]  It's a rug pull.
[03:24:04.937 --> 03:24:06.498]  There's nothing behind the tokens.
[03:24:06.498 --> 03:24:07.178]  It's fiat.
[03:24:07.178 --> 03:24:09.720]  They're taking all the money.
[03:24:09.720 --> 03:24:12.403]  That's exactly how the Federal Reserve works.
[03:24:12.403 --> 03:24:15.325]  It's like, everybody's shocked.
[03:24:15.325 --> 03:24:20.649]  We'll wait till you find out that the Federal Reserve is the same scam system.
[03:24:20.649 --> 03:24:22.391]  It's a giant rug pull Ponzi scheme.
[03:24:23.351 --> 03:24:45.950]  And if you go back, you know, the creature from Jekyll Island, if you go back to Woodrow Wilson, Colonel Edwin Mandel House, who was the UK banking elite agent who helped get all that legislation through, who helped promote Woodrow Wilson, setting up and weaponizing the Federal Reserve System, which, by the way, is part of the Communist Manifesto.
[03:24:45.950 --> 03:24:49.072]  If you didn't know, you might think that communists don't like bankers.
[03:24:49.072 --> 03:24:52.235]  But in fact, if you remember, we did a whole breakdown of this famous book.
[03:24:53.061 --> 03:24:59.585]  No, in fact, communism has always had billionaire funding, as did fascism.
[03:24:59.585 --> 03:25:05.228]  Fascism has the exact same history as Professor Anthony Sutton has shown in his books.
[03:25:05.228 --> 03:25:18.136]  So it also turns out that there seems to be connections to MIT, the background of FTX, people at MIT, people in the finance department, people connected to some of those Epstein departments, it turns out.
[03:25:18.136 --> 03:25:19.516]  And why is that?
[03:25:19.516 --> 03:25:22.038]  Well, because this is a giant Ponzi scheme.
[03:25:22.785 --> 03:25:29.670]  A giant scam intended precisely to funnel people's money offshore.
[03:25:29.670 --> 03:25:38.617]  And again, if you are shocked by this, I can't stress how shocking it is to you to understand that the dollar is the same.
[03:25:38.617 --> 03:25:45.503]  You understand that they're doing the same thing with your tax money, with the dollar, especially when it moved off of the gold standard.
[03:25:46.132 --> 03:25:50.514]  But even prior to that, Dr. Carol Quigley, everybody knows all the hold up the books, right?
[03:25:50.514 --> 03:26:00.498]  It's just basically a show and tell book program over here in the fourth hour with me, your librarian nerd who does your homework for you.
[03:26:00.498 --> 03:26:07.681]  Dr. Carol Quigley talks about how the banker notes were always a fiat scam going back hundreds of years.
[03:26:07.681 --> 03:26:12.143]  And they would print up more notes and flood the society with notes.
[03:26:14.113 --> 03:26:30.596]  Beyond the actual gold holdings that they had and that was part of this gold note scam and So the same thing is the model for the central bank that was set up throughout the the central bank So should they set up throughout the throughout Europe?
[03:26:30.596 --> 03:26:40.758]  Throughout the 1800s and the 1900s and that became the model for the Bank for International Settlements Which is the World Reserve Bank of World Reserve Banks the Federal Reserve of Federal Reserves?
[03:26:40.758 --> 03:26:43.338]  It's the central Federal Reserve Bank of the world
[03:26:44.201 --> 03:26:45.842]  Federal Reserve Banking System.
[03:26:45.842 --> 03:26:54.886]  They all are connected to that hub, and most people don't know about this by design, on purpose.
[03:26:54.886 --> 03:26:58.828]  And that's why it occupies a central section of Carol Quigley's Strategy and Hope.
[03:26:59.517 --> 03:27:02.919]  As well as a few other people who seem to have picked up on this over the years.
[03:27:02.919 --> 03:27:21.788]  A few economists and a few people who have written on this, but for the most part people just are mystified and they think it's like this big onion layered scheme scam of all of these different, you know, economics and so the GDP and the jobs report and this report and that report and it's all a bunch of mystery and smoke and mirrors.
[03:27:21.788 --> 03:27:23.329]  And guess what?
[03:27:23.329 --> 03:27:26.191]  Guess what's behind all that smoke and mirrors?
[03:27:26.191 --> 03:27:28.472]  Well, it's not stacks of gold
[03:27:29.375 --> 03:27:32.936]  At Fort Knox, right?
[03:27:32.936 --> 03:27:35.757]  It's FTT scam tokens.
[03:27:35.757 --> 03:27:37.257]  It's the exact same thing.
[03:27:37.257 --> 03:27:40.498]  So if you're mad about FTX or you think that, oh, crypto's a scam.
[03:27:40.498 --> 03:27:42.499]  It's not a scam.
[03:27:42.499 --> 03:27:44.299]  Many cryptos are scams.
[03:27:44.299 --> 03:27:46.880]  But you understand this has nothing to do, for example, with Bitcoin.
[03:27:46.880 --> 03:27:50.361]  Bitcoin is the preeminent inflationary.
[03:27:50.361 --> 03:27:51.381]  It's the hardest asset.
[03:27:51.381 --> 03:27:53.902]  It's completely inflationary resistant.
[03:27:54.904 --> 03:28:20.432]  Because it has the fixed number of coins that can never be inflated beyond the fixed number when the last Bitcoin is mined and so it's extremely rare and for that reason it is not like these kinds of Proof-of-stake coins that are all just printed out of thin air These are all again literally modeled on the Federal Reserve System on the Enron style scam system and
[03:28:21.113 --> 03:28:30.656]  On the coming carbon scam system, when they pull out, roll out the carbon credits and the carbon tokens and the carbon-based cryptos, those are already starting to roll out.
[03:28:30.656 --> 03:28:31.516]  Guess what?
[03:28:31.516 --> 03:28:37.238]  They're the exact same model as FTX and all of the other collapsed scam models.
[03:28:37.238 --> 03:28:40.819]  Luna, Terra Luna, that collapsed, what, three or four months ago?
[03:28:40.819 --> 03:28:42.860]  Exact same scam model, exact same rug pull.
[03:28:43.584 --> 03:28:44.804]  Exact same.
[03:28:44.804 --> 03:28:48.725]  You can earn 30% by staking your coins and it's just printed out of nowhere.
[03:28:48.725 --> 03:28:51.725]  That's all the scam stolen money, right?
[03:28:51.725 --> 03:28:54.586]  And they're gambling with your money that you put on the exchange.
[03:28:54.586 --> 03:28:55.146]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:55.146 --> 03:28:56.026]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:56.026 --> 03:28:57.226]  I'm your guest host, Jay Doe.
[03:28:57.226 --> 03:29:02.767]  Ladies and gentlemen, we always run the biggest deals of the year starting in mid-November through Christmas.
[03:29:02.767 --> 03:29:08.028]  But this year is hands down the biggest sale we've ever offered.
[03:29:08.028 --> 03:29:10.689]  Not just up to 60% off with promo code 1776.
[03:29:12.529 --> 03:29:18.353]  But on top of it, double patriot points and what makes this the most special sale ever.
[03:29:18.353 --> 03:29:22.797]  Every order will get a free gift, no matter how small or how big.
[03:29:22.797 --> 03:29:27.200]  And it's all randomly selected by the shopping cart computer.
[03:29:27.200 --> 03:29:29.482]  So you might order a sticker pack for $5.
[03:29:29.482 --> 03:29:35.386]  You might order the blowout t-shirt sale for $4.95 and then get something worth $50, $60, $70, $80, $100.
[03:29:37.688 --> 03:29:40.449]  So, again, some of the gifts are sticker packed.
[03:29:40.449 --> 03:29:42.230]  Some of them are Alex Jones Halloween masks.
[03:29:42.230 --> 03:29:46.512]  Some of them are books, films, InfoWars flags, American flags.
[03:29:46.512 --> 03:29:48.273]  There are hundreds of different items.
[03:29:48.273 --> 03:29:49.453]  It's all random.
[03:29:49.453 --> 03:29:50.994]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:50.994 --> 03:29:53.195]  Every order gets a free gift.
[03:29:53.195 --> 03:29:56.056]  Free gifts with every order at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:57.208 --> 03:29:59.429]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[03:29:59.429 --> 03:30:03.451]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.
[03:30:03.451 --> 03:30:04.771]  There's a solution.
[03:30:04.771 --> 03:30:05.752]  The Wellness Company.
[03:30:05.752 --> 03:30:09.053]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[03:30:09.053 --> 03:30:16.276]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[03:30:16.536 --> 03:30:42.594]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[03:30:43.687 --> 03:30:44.188]  I think so.
[03:31:04.051 --> 03:31:14.421]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[03:31:14.421 --> 03:31:27.172]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[03:31:27.833 --> 03:31:28.433]  We're good to go.
[03:31:56.755 --> 03:31:59.096]  I've got some good news and bad news.
[03:31:59.096 --> 03:32:04.298]  InfoWars is running the biggest sale of 2022 right now on our amazing products.

[03:32:18.364 --> 03:32:19.705]  X3 sold out.

[03:32:58.622 --> 03:33:04.523]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:12.915 --> 03:33:13.975]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.975 --> 03:33:15.976]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:33:15.976 --> 03:33:20.517]  I want to remind you, if you notice there on the screen, you'll see that second box there.
[03:33:20.517 --> 03:33:29.079]  It's one of my biggest interviews I've done to date, and that is with Colonel Douglas McGregor, who was Trump's pick for National Security Advisor.
[03:33:29.079 --> 03:33:30.959]  He did not get that post.
[03:33:30.959 --> 03:33:32.279]  That was blocked, I think.
[03:33:32.279 --> 03:33:34.020]  That involved Mitch McConnell, if I recall.
[03:33:34.820 --> 03:33:38.202]  Colonel McGregor is a frequent guest on Tucker Carlson.
[03:33:38.202 --> 03:33:51.730]  You may have seen him or heard of him, and we did a full hour breakdown of everything from the Great Reset to FTX scam token, Sam Beckman Freed style Federal Reserve stuff, to the Ukraine situation, Russia, etc.
[03:33:51.730 --> 03:33:52.831]  It was an amazing interview.
[03:33:52.831 --> 03:33:55.232]  It's, again, one of the biggest I've done to date.
[03:33:55.232 --> 03:33:57.814]  Be sure and go to my YouTube channel and check that out.
[03:33:57.814 --> 03:34:02.617]  It's getting a lot of attention, a lot of good feedback, so if you're looking for a deeper breakdown from
[03:34:03.317 --> 03:34:06.099]  From a high-profile individual, definitely go check that out.
[03:34:06.099 --> 03:34:16.348]  And also, I would add, today, I'm going to be uploading, we had earlier in the last hour, Alex had the children of two of the most famous directors.
[03:34:16.348 --> 03:34:22.693]  I just did an interview with one of the other most famous directors, his son, Andre Tarkovsky Jr.
[03:34:22.693 --> 03:34:24.334]  So if you're familiar with Tarkovsky's films,
[03:34:25.743 --> 03:34:41.633]  And the amazing art that he put out over the years, films like S.T.A.L.K.E.R., films like Solaris, films like Rublev, sort of capturing the history and the essence of Eurasia and Russia, especially in art and iconography.
[03:34:41.633 --> 03:34:46.336]  We went really deep into the breakdown of Andre Jr.'
[03:34:46.316 --> 03:34:47.877]  's documentary that he put out.
[03:34:47.877 --> 03:34:49.578]  It's now at the Criterion Collection.
[03:34:50.499 --> 03:34:53.222]  Send him a prayer about his father, about Andrei Tarkovsky.
[03:34:53.222 --> 03:35:02.655]  So Tarkovsky, of course, being hugely influential as well in the global film scene, influencing many, many filmmakers in the West, in Hollywood as well.
[03:35:04.329 --> 03:35:05.730]  And so you definitely want to check that out.
[03:35:05.730 --> 03:35:07.731]  I'll be premiering that on my channel this week as well.
[03:35:07.731 --> 03:35:10.813]  It's also already available on my Rockfin channel.
[03:35:10.813 --> 03:35:18.498]  So if you're looking for information like that, that's a little edgier, a little, a little sooner than other stuff, you can subscribe to me over on Rockfin.
[03:35:18.498 --> 03:35:21.320]  I think Greg Reese is maybe coming over to Rockfin as well.
[03:35:21.320 --> 03:35:23.121]  Paul Joseph Watson's on Rockfin too.
[03:35:23.121 --> 03:35:25.342]  So a lot of, a lot of cool stuff over there.
[03:35:25.342 --> 03:35:30.145]  You know, we were talking about this, the scam model, how the scams work.
[03:35:35.154 --> 03:35:35.354]  Thank you.
[03:35:50.985 --> 03:35:55.127]  Organized crime set up the secret societies that they had.
[03:35:55.127 --> 03:35:58.568]  We go back to Sicily in the 1800s, 1700s.
[03:35:58.568 --> 03:36:14.194]  This is the origin of the Omerta, which is a secret oath, a death oath that you make to your Don, to the Don of the local, at that time it was a militia, but the militias are actually, the local militias is where we get the idea of
[03:36:14.941 --> 03:36:16.122]  The Sicilian Mafia.
[03:36:16.122 --> 03:36:30.809]  Now, when a lot of the immigrants came over to the U.S., they didn't find a lot of help with the existing local police, so naturally they would continue their model of local neighborhood militia, and that's where we get the ideas of the Don and this kind of stuff.
[03:36:30.809 --> 03:36:42.675]  But the Omerita, the secret ritual, which is actually a copy from certain Masonic rituals and Masonic groups out of Italy, known as the Carbonari, they copied this, and that's because
[03:36:43.315 --> 03:37:06.060]  One of the early Italian revolutionaries, his name was Garibaldi, he was influenced by Giuseppe Mazzini, who was one of the most famous, there you go, exactly, this is the Omerta scene in Sopranos, and I'm sure if you've never seen the Sopranos, I highly recommend checking it out, because there's a lot of gabagool, a lot of gabagool!
[03:37:07.406 --> 03:37:12.550]  A lot of gabagool, a lot of goomars, and a lot of goombahs up in the Sopranos, but it's a great show.
[03:37:12.550 --> 03:37:26.962]  We did a whole two-hour breakdown of that show, by the way, if you're looking for a great podcast, getting into all the really insightful elements in that show, including, there's the Omeretor right there, where you burn the image of the saint, and you sort of take a blood oath.
[03:37:28.197 --> 03:37:33.540]  But there's also references to, you know, the tie-in with organized crime and intelligence agencies.
[03:37:33.540 --> 03:37:38.683]  There's references to the CIA, to Tony having to, at times, collude with the FBI.
[03:37:38.683 --> 03:37:42.164]  All of that comes up in that show consistently throughout.
[03:37:42.164 --> 03:37:46.146]  Yeah, I think one of the best TV shows ever made, honestly.
[03:37:46.146 --> 03:37:56.412]  But it's instructive, again, because as you heard Vivian, I think, mention in the last hour, you know, the organized crime model is really the best way to understand how the global elites run things.
[03:37:57.702 --> 03:38:00.503]  This may sound like, oh yeah, of course, there's organized crime.
[03:38:00.503 --> 03:38:01.783]  Yeah, we all know that.
[03:38:01.783 --> 03:38:09.886]  But people just still can't figure out there's this block in their head, this roadblock between there being organized crime and global organized crime.
[03:38:09.886 --> 03:38:11.086]  They just cannot figure this out.
[03:38:11.086 --> 03:38:16.548]  They cannot figure out that giant pharmaceutical corporations operate like organized crime.
[03:38:16.548 --> 03:38:21.770]  They can't figure out that giant international banking institutions operate like organized crime.
[03:38:21.770 --> 03:38:25.391]  Now, we just had a giant institution that collapsed
[03:38:26.764 --> 03:38:27.264]  Guess what?
[03:38:27.264 --> 03:38:29.787]  It's operating on an organized crime model.
[03:38:29.787 --> 03:38:33.790]  And it's not run by nerdy dude with an afro.
[03:38:33.790 --> 03:38:34.711]  He's the face of that.
[03:38:34.711 --> 03:38:35.471]  He's the front of that.
[03:38:35.471 --> 03:38:38.214]  And the face, the front people, they take the fall.
[03:38:38.214 --> 03:38:41.216]  And the media right now is running cover for him.
[03:38:41.216 --> 03:38:43.218]  Mainstream media is running cover for Sam Bateman.
[03:38:43.218 --> 03:38:44.519]  Oh, he's altruistic.
[03:38:44.519 --> 03:38:46.000]  It's not his fault.
[03:38:46.000 --> 03:38:47.121]  It's all these other people.
[03:38:47.856 --> 03:38:48.957]  Well, yeah, maybe.
[03:38:48.957 --> 03:38:50.197]  He's just a front man.
[03:38:50.197 --> 03:39:00.401]  But they're covering up because they know it shows that the giant establishment leftist, especially Democratic Party system is a big scam.
[03:39:00.401 --> 03:39:04.023]  And it totally exposes all that.
[03:39:04.023 --> 03:39:07.024]  And it exposes that because it's kind of always been that way.
[03:39:07.024 --> 03:39:11.806]  And I'm not saying that the Republican Party doesn't have much of a phonies and con artists as well.
[03:39:11.806 --> 03:39:15.488]  I mean, they're basically the same party for the most part, right, except for
[03:39:16.261 --> 03:39:23.259]  A few outliers and people that, you know, people on this broadcast all know about, for the most part, these people are all part of the same big scam.
[03:39:24.518 --> 03:39:34.806]  And crypto was just one of those easier ways to kind of mask the scammery by selling people on the idea that the Federal Reserve model of fiat system.
[03:39:34.806 --> 03:39:36.588]  Oh, let's just put that into crypto.
[03:39:36.588 --> 03:39:47.676]  Do the exact same thing where we can print up infinite amounts of digits on the screen and just say, oh, yeah, well, there's there's a zillion FTT token and we'll just keep inflating the price of the fake coin.
[03:39:47.676 --> 03:39:53.381]  And as people invest, they will take the investor's money and put it into his own betting and investments.
[03:39:54.282 --> 03:40:06.467]  And, you know, again, it's obvious that this is just the exact same model of the Federal Reserve scam debt-based system applied to the crypto world and the whole point of Bitcoin itself.
[03:40:06.467 --> 03:40:11.390]  Bitcoin, which has nothing to do with any of these things, none of these scams.
[03:40:11.390 --> 03:40:15.612]  Bitcoin exists to fight that model.
[03:40:15.612 --> 03:40:16.512]  That's its purpose.
[03:40:17.541 --> 03:40:22.907]  So, you know, I think a lot of people kind of we were open to the possibility of where Ethereum might go.
[03:40:22.907 --> 03:40:30.015]  Ethereum was for many, many years based on this idea of proof of work like Bitcoin model.
[03:40:30.015 --> 03:40:34.840]  And then it recently switched to, quote, proof of stake and admitted to the censoring.
[03:40:35.606 --> 03:40:42.409]  So, Tornado Cash, these other recent scandals in the domain of Ethereum, have proven that Ethereum is now part of GlobalCoin.
[03:40:42.409 --> 03:40:47.671]  In fact, Klaus even says he likes it now.
[03:40:47.671 --> 03:40:57.855]  So, while we might have withheld judgment and been open to the possibility, now it's gone into full-on, it's part of, apparently, it seems like it wants to go in the direction of KlausCoin, GlobalCoin.
[03:40:58.869 --> 03:41:07.017]  Because now they're willing to admit censoring when they're requested to censor at the node level.
[03:41:07.017 --> 03:41:08.899]  And that's not what Bitcoin is.
[03:41:08.899 --> 03:41:10.641]  Bitcoin is not that, you see.
[03:41:10.641 --> 03:41:11.521]  So it's different.
[03:41:11.521 --> 03:41:15.185]  So a lot of people who don't know about this sector, they kind of class it all together.
[03:41:15.185 --> 03:41:18.368]  And every time there's a shakeout, oh, it's because it's all a scam.
[03:41:18.368 --> 03:41:19.149]  It's not all a scam.
[03:41:19.904 --> 03:41:24.250]  That's why all of these other coins are not modeled like Bitcoin is modeled, right?
[03:41:24.250 --> 03:41:28.476]  And so, again, it sort of vindicates Max Keiser in a way, right?
[03:41:28.476 --> 03:41:29.037]  Max Keiser!
[03:41:29.037 --> 03:41:29.518]  Max Keiser!
[03:41:29.518 --> 03:41:30.259]  Bitcoin!
[03:41:30.259 --> 03:41:31.581]  Bitcoin is vindicated.
[03:41:32.145 --> 03:41:35.347]  Because it's all the Bitcoin people, right?
[03:41:35.347 --> 03:41:43.231]  Michael Saylor, Max Keiser, who had been saying for the last year that these entities are going to start collapsing.
[03:41:43.231 --> 03:41:45.632]  You're going to see, you know, this Three Arrows Capital.
[03:41:45.632 --> 03:41:46.593]  You're going to see Voyager.
[03:41:46.593 --> 03:41:48.954]  You're going to see Terra Luna.
[03:41:48.954 --> 03:41:53.596]  You're going to see, because the same model had been done in the past through exchanges like Mt.
[03:41:53.596 --> 03:41:56.178]  Gox, which got hacked many, many years ago.
[03:41:56.178 --> 03:42:00.340]  BitConnect was another one of these Ponzi scams that collapsed based on
[03:42:00.900 --> 03:42:04.881]  Paying people out of money, tokens made out of thin air, basically.
[03:42:04.881 --> 03:42:06.442]  So these are all just scam models.
[03:42:06.442 --> 03:42:07.942]  That's all I'm trying to say.
[03:42:07.942 --> 03:42:10.703]  And that doesn't mean that everybody or everything in crypto is a scam.
[03:42:10.703 --> 03:42:12.963]  That's why it wasn't about Bitcoin.
[03:42:12.963 --> 03:42:16.784]  It was about everything but Bitcoin, you see.
[03:42:16.784 --> 03:42:20.165]  And most of the global elites don't like Bitcoin.
[03:42:20.165 --> 03:42:21.006]  Openly, right?
[03:42:21.006 --> 03:42:24.066]  Bill Gates, I wish we never had Bitcoin, right?
[03:42:24.066 --> 03:42:26.027]  Hillary, get rid of Bitcoin.
[03:42:26.027 --> 03:42:29.948]  They all do not like that because that's one of the ones that they can't control.
[03:42:30.678 --> 03:42:32.819]  Because it's actually decentralized.
[03:42:32.819 --> 03:42:39.440]  These other ones are completely centralized and are based on the print-out-of-thin-air scam debt model.
[03:42:39.440 --> 03:42:41.261]  That is the Federal Reserve model.
[03:42:41.261 --> 03:42:52.584]  And that's why this was all promoted for the last three years with zillions of dollars by all these Democrats and all these, you know, Wall Street CNBC people to pump this up because it was a scam.
[03:42:53.741 --> 03:42:54.741]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:54.741 --> 03:42:55.621]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:55.621 --> 03:42:56.902]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:42:56.902 --> 03:43:08.404]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[03:43:08.404 --> 03:43:12.845]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[03:43:12.845 --> 03:43:16.826]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[03:43:16.826 --> 03:43:20.467]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[03:43:20.467 --> 03:43:21.547]  You see, the sun
[03:43:23.007 --> 03:43:23.347]  I think so.
[03:43:46.957 --> 03:43:50.745]  At InfoWarStore.com with promo code 1776.
[03:43:50.745 --> 03:43:51.446]  Don't wait!
[03:43:51.446 --> 03:43:55.734]  Support the InfoWar and your immune system with vitamin D3 gummies at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:43:59.002 --> 03:44:03.224]  It's been a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[03:44:03.224 --> 03:44:09.628]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[03:44:09.628 --> 03:44:14.771]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[03:44:14.771 --> 03:44:16.472]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[03:44:16.472 --> 03:44:17.773]  Yes, I've persevered.
[03:44:17.773 --> 03:44:22.896]  But the listeners and viewers who support Infowars are the real reason we have this success.
[03:44:23.616 --> 03:44:29.040]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[03:44:29.040 --> 03:44:33.362]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[03:44:33.362 --> 03:44:42.548]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[03:44:42.548 --> 03:44:43.949]  God bless you all.
[03:44:43.949 --> 03:44:44.990]  I salute you.
[03:44:44.990 --> 03:44:46.010]  I thank you.
[03:44:46.010 --> 03:44:51.594]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[03:44:52.114 --> 03:44:53.435]  The fight is my fight.
[03:44:53.435 --> 03:44:54.075]  It's your fight.
[03:44:54.075 --> 03:44:54.816]  It's our fight.
[03:44:54.816 --> 03:44:56.757]  God bless you all.
[03:44:56.757 --> 03:44:57.978]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[03:44:57.978 --> 03:45:01.680]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[03:45:01.680 --> 03:45:07.483]  Now the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[03:45:07.483 --> 03:45:11.986]  The bad news is by Christmas almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[03:45:11.986 --> 03:45:14.087]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[03:45:14.087 --> 03:45:16.629]  So now is the time to take action to support the InfoWar
[03:45:16.889 --> 03:45:17.149]  I think so.
[03:45:39.795 --> 03:45:46.743]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today, so every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:45:46.743 --> 03:45:53.450]  Promo code 1776 and you get an additional 10% off the already giant savings at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:45:53.450 --> 03:45:54.751]  Thank you so much for your support.
[03:45:54.751 --> 03:45:55.172]  God bless.
[03:45:56.929 --> 03:45:59.411]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[03:45:59.411 --> 03:46:00.692]  Why is this taking so long?
[03:46:00.692 --> 03:46:04.175]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[03:46:04.175 --> 03:46:05.436]  Why can't we do this here?
[03:46:05.436 --> 03:46:07.998]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[03:46:07.998 --> 03:46:13.862]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[03:46:14.002 --> 03:46:15.824]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[03:46:15.824 --> 03:46:17.746]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[03:46:17.746 --> 03:46:19.667]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[03:46:19.667 --> 03:46:30.257]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America First majority in every single one of them.
[03:46:30.257 --> 03:46:33.981]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[03:46:34.381 --> 03:46:37.263]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[03:46:37.263 --> 03:46:39.705]  Communications are the reason why we didn't well.
[03:46:39.705 --> 03:46:43.387]  That's why Infowars.com is so damn important.
[03:46:43.387 --> 03:46:46.729]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[03:46:46.729 --> 03:46:48.951]  People need to get behind Infowars.
[03:46:48.951 --> 03:46:54.234]  This alternative media that we worked so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[03:46:54.234 --> 03:46:56.716]  We need more of this communications, not less.
[03:46:58.524 --> 03:47:13.591]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:13.591 --> 03:47:15.052]  Do you copy?
[03:47:15.052 --> 03:47:15.652]  Do you copy?
[03:47:16.818 --> 03:47:17.378]  I'm just joking.
[03:47:17.378 --> 03:47:18.519]  That's my Andrew Tate impression.
[03:47:18.519 --> 03:47:20.159]  But welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:20.159 --> 03:47:21.920]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:47:21.920 --> 03:47:39.907]  We are talking about the structures of large-scale scammery, large-scale deception, large-scale financial bamboozlery, and particularly the Federal Reserve System is kind of actually pretty much the same as the FDX.
[03:47:40.640 --> 03:47:42.003]  We're good to go.
[03:47:52.154 --> 03:48:01.179]  Oh, being involved in a little bit of sanitation, take out the dead body, take out a little bit of the trash, dab a goo!
[03:48:11.610 --> 03:48:13.853]  And that actually comes up throughout The Sopranos as well.
[03:48:13.853 --> 03:48:21.060]  There's many episodes where Tony gets involved in a big-scale gentrification HUD type of scam, right?
[03:48:21.060 --> 03:48:23.583]  And that's referenced, I think, in season one or two.
[03:48:23.583 --> 03:48:27.827]  Very similar to the stuff that Catherine Austin Fitz had investigated amazingly.
[03:48:29.853 --> 03:48:51.447]  There's a couple other episodes where, you know, Tony gets involved in these high-level financial scams that at one point he sets up a front thing that has to do with stock scams, right, and stock trading and whatnot, and he puts a couple guys running this, and that works for a little while and makes maybe a few million dollars, something like that.
[03:48:51.447 --> 03:48:57.571]  But those are models on a micro scale for what big-scale scammers do on a macro scale.
[03:48:58.431 --> 03:49:03.097]  And it's just amazing to me that, you know, people can figure this out at the local level.
[03:49:03.097 --> 03:49:14.349]  They can figure it out that maybe even their governor at a state level, maybe even the president or some government official is involved in a scam.
[03:49:14.349 --> 03:49:16.372]  But they can't figure it out beyond these
[03:49:19.611 --> 03:49:22.173]  As if there aren't billionaires involved in scams.
[03:49:22.173 --> 03:49:29.218]  As if there aren't people, you know, like FTX scale people, multi-billion dollar scams.
[03:49:29.218 --> 03:49:37.344]  Now everybody knows about Enron, everybody knows about Bernie Madoff, and now everybody knows about FTX, but do you think that that's it?
[03:49:37.344 --> 03:49:41.607]  Like that that's the only scams that go on, or that's the only deception that goes on?
[03:49:41.607 --> 03:49:44.689]  You don't think that it goes on at the level of the Federal Reserve?
[03:49:44.689 --> 03:49:47.311]  Does it go on the level of the Bank for International Settlements?
[03:49:49.497 --> 03:49:52.500]  What about the level of Davos and the World Economic Forum?
[03:49:52.500 --> 03:49:55.623]  Could they possibly be involved in economic scammery?
[03:49:55.623 --> 03:50:03.470]  Or do you think that they're all altruistic people who want to help you, like Sam Bankman-Fried?
[03:50:03.470 --> 03:50:06.593]  Are they just sweet, nice people?
[03:50:06.593 --> 03:50:09.436]  They care about your health.
[03:50:09.436 --> 03:50:12.439]  They want you to be happy and healthy, while they also want you to not be around.
[03:50:13.713 --> 03:50:16.514]  Right, I mean, how can people not figure this out?
[03:50:16.514 --> 03:50:17.815]  I'm mystified by this.
[03:50:17.815 --> 03:50:25.018]  And so, the point of this is that, well, how do we understand Sam Bankman Freed and FTX and then the Democratic Party connection there?
[03:50:25.018 --> 03:50:25.998]  Well, it's like mafia.
[03:50:25.998 --> 03:50:27.899]  It's like organized crime.
[03:50:27.899 --> 03:50:30.560]  You gotta work for the big boys.
[03:50:30.560 --> 03:50:34.561]  You know, we'll promote you on the global stage for the next three years.
[03:50:34.561 --> 03:50:36.062]  Sam, come work for us.
[03:50:36.940 --> 03:50:49.703]  You'd be the nerdy tech face of crypto because, presumably, from the psychological warfare vantage point, from the market research, the only people into crypto are nerds.
[03:50:49.703 --> 03:50:52.023]  So you're the face of it.
[03:50:52.023 --> 03:50:56.284]  Maybe other Silicon Valley companies with nerdy face people are the same, you think?
[03:50:56.284 --> 03:50:56.804]  You think?
[03:50:56.804 --> 03:50:57.604]  Maybe?
[03:50:57.604 --> 03:51:00.105]  Maybe something like Facebook is something like... I don't know.
[03:51:00.105 --> 03:51:00.585]  What do you think?
[03:51:00.585 --> 03:51:01.205]  I don't know.
[03:51:01.205 --> 03:51:02.105]  What do you think?
[03:51:02.105 --> 03:51:02.826]  Think about this.
[03:51:02.826 --> 03:51:04.326]  Maybe this is a model for other things.
[03:51:04.326 --> 03:51:04.666]  I don't know.
[03:51:07.111 --> 03:51:09.653]  And then you do what we say.
[03:51:09.653 --> 03:51:19.062]  However, if things go sour, maybe you don't pay your dues.
[03:51:19.062 --> 03:51:20.403]  What happens?
[03:51:20.403 --> 03:51:22.565]  Well, you take the fall.
[03:51:22.565 --> 03:51:23.926]  You're the fall guy.
[03:51:23.926 --> 03:51:27.850]  You're the man that is the face of this, and you're the one that calls all this.
[03:51:27.850 --> 03:51:32.494]  Maybe we'll run a little interference for you for the mainstream media, and we'll try to say that
[03:51:33.064 --> 03:51:36.267]  You know, you're just this autistic, genius, savant, nerd guy.
[03:51:36.267 --> 03:51:43.553]  But no, ultimately, right, this guy might take the fall as if it's just one guy.
[03:51:43.553 --> 03:51:46.735]  And that's another lie the system's always propping up, right?
[03:51:46.735 --> 03:51:48.176]  Like, oh, it's just this one dude.
[03:51:48.176 --> 03:51:49.297]  It's one.
[03:51:49.297 --> 03:51:50.898]  We got one bad apple over here.
[03:51:50.898 --> 03:51:57.724]  We'll root the bad apples as if this is not a gigantor scam with obviously a lot of high-level connections.
[03:51:57.724 --> 03:52:01.267]  But of course, the high-level people, the dons,
[03:52:02.839 --> 03:52:07.641]  Not Don Trump, the Dons, the Don in the sense of the mob Don, right?
[03:52:07.641 --> 03:52:22.066]  The structure of the mafia, if you didn't know this, the reason that it was so successful for many decades in the 30s, 40s and 50s was a cell model where a lot of the foot soldiers, they didn't actually know who was running things.
[03:52:22.066 --> 03:52:25.867]  They might know about the Don, but they might not even meet him very much, right?
[03:52:25.867 --> 03:52:28.128]  So they don't really know it's compartmentalized.
[03:52:28.128 --> 03:52:29.168]  It's a cell structure.
[03:52:30.624 --> 03:52:40.734]  And it was so successful and hard to bust because a lot of the soldiers, they would interact with the bosses, but the boss alone interacted with the Don.
[03:52:40.734 --> 03:52:46.640]  And so that's one way, one model by which this type of thing was so successful.
[03:52:46.640 --> 03:52:49.123]  And that's also portrayed throughout The Sopranos as well.
[03:52:50.377 --> 03:52:52.879]  Because remember, you know, Tony's not really a Don.
[03:52:52.879 --> 03:52:55.680]  Tony is a boss, right?
[03:52:55.680 --> 03:52:57.221]  And he's got soldiers under him.
[03:52:57.221 --> 03:53:03.444]  But, you know, Tony has to interact with and deal with the Dons of the five families, right?
[03:53:03.444 --> 03:53:10.428]  And so every now and then he'll have to drive over to New York and talk to the various Dons.
[03:53:10.428 --> 03:53:12.429]  But Tony's not exactly at that level.
[03:53:12.429 --> 03:53:13.629]  He's sort of below that.
[03:53:15.763 --> 03:53:24.681]  And so he's oftentimes having to get Christopher, the main foot soldier throughout the series, to go and do all these operations and run all this stuff.
[03:53:24.681 --> 03:53:26.645]  But Christopher has to pay his cut.
[03:53:28.098 --> 03:53:28.619]  Right.
[03:53:28.619 --> 03:53:34.646]  When he gets made, if you remember in the show, that comes with new responsibilities.
[03:53:34.646 --> 03:53:34.786]  Right.
[03:53:34.786 --> 03:53:37.830]  So Christopher, his whole life, he lacks his father figure.
[03:53:37.830 --> 03:53:38.671]  He looks up to Tony.
[03:53:38.671 --> 03:53:48.042]  Tony plays this father figure role when he finally gets made from, you know, being just sort of a thug to a made man.
[03:53:49.039 --> 03:53:49.599]  We're good to go.
[03:54:19.721 --> 03:54:26.596]  And this ends up in him having an after death or near death experience right where he gets shot and he sees himself in hell.
[03:54:27.687 --> 03:54:30.530]  And he relates this, you know, throughout, midway throughout the show.
[03:54:30.530 --> 03:54:39.698]  Anyway, the point is just that this is the model for understanding how the elite in our day run things on a grander scale.
[03:54:39.698 --> 03:54:40.939]  It's the exact same.
[03:54:40.939 --> 03:54:43.922]  And that was the point Vivian Kubrick was making in the previous hour.
[03:54:43.922 --> 03:54:45.683]  So hopefully everybody caught that.
[03:54:45.683 --> 03:54:51.648]  And, you know, Sean Stone was making the same point with secret societies and spies and spy networks and all that.
[03:54:51.648 --> 03:54:54.371]  It's the same stuff with this, right, with organized crime.
[03:54:55.314 --> 03:54:59.315]  And, you know, that's what this is, you know, controlling the black markets, right?
[03:54:59.315 --> 03:55:11.438]  Brzezinski, he made that famous comment that it wasn't just a matter of, you know, in terms of geopolitics, controlling legitimate markets, it was also necessary to control the black markets.
[03:55:11.438 --> 03:55:18.220]  That's a big part of controlling things on the geopolitical grand chessboard, running black markets as well.
[03:55:18.220 --> 03:55:23.901]  And so this is where you get into, you know, a lot of the dark stuff that everybody's heard about and that has come out in the last
[03:55:24.827 --> 03:55:25.887]  Several years, right?
[03:55:25.887 --> 03:55:30.569]  And regarding, you know, regarding international black market type stuff.
[03:55:30.569 --> 03:55:33.190]  And this also relates to elections.
[03:55:33.190 --> 03:55:38.672]  If you remember, and this is all everybody's talking about this in the last week because of the midterm elections.
[03:55:38.672 --> 03:55:43.354]  And it's sort of like you can't talk about election fraud or scammery.
[03:55:43.354 --> 03:55:48.836]  You're not supposed to talk about that, even though that is a fact of history.
[03:55:48.836 --> 03:55:50.036]  So facts of history.
[03:55:50.860 --> 03:55:53.341]  And it's even well known that the U.S.
[03:55:53.341 --> 03:55:59.823]  has employed certain people to fix elections in other countries for the last 60, 70, 80 years.
[03:55:59.823 --> 03:56:05.886]  There's people who are fixers who go for intelligence agencies and go and fix elections.
[03:56:05.886 --> 03:56:11.868]  I think Roger Stone even did a whole breakdown of who fixed elections in other countries and might have been involved in
[03:56:12.951 --> 03:56:14.753]  Fixing the previous presidential election.
[03:56:14.753 --> 03:56:20.198]  There was a big famous essay that Roger Stone did two or three years ago on that very thing.
[03:56:20.198 --> 03:56:25.202]  Pointing this out, this kind of should be well known, but no, you can't even mention that.
[03:56:25.202 --> 03:56:37.974]  So as the world government is put into place, as gigantic financial scam institutions collapse, you can't talk about it, and you're bad if you do, but also it's not that bad.
[03:56:38.931 --> 03:56:39.531]  Right?
[03:56:39.531 --> 03:56:42.573]  So, for years and years and years, there was no global government.
[03:56:42.573 --> 03:56:44.153]  You're bad if you mention that.
[03:56:44.153 --> 03:56:45.354]  You're crazy.
[03:56:45.354 --> 03:56:47.435]  By the way, there is a global government and it's a good thing.
[03:56:47.435 --> 03:56:51.156]  And if you don't like it, it's because you're a bigot and you're a small-minder.
[03:56:51.156 --> 03:56:52.597]  So, it's just gaslighting.
[03:56:52.597 --> 03:56:59.240]  Just like, you know, half of my videos on YouTube have the Great Reset warning from Wikipedia.
[03:56:59.240 --> 03:57:02.381]  The New World Order warning from Wikipedia.
[03:57:02.381 --> 03:57:06.543]  And it went viral on Twitter this week that as you talk about
[03:57:07.737 --> 03:57:12.300]  The global government summit that's going on.
[03:57:12.300 --> 03:57:26.047]  There's a warning pops up to tell you that this is disinformation and conspiracy theory, that there's a global government summit as it is going on.
[03:57:26.047 --> 03:57:28.328]  Amazingly.
[03:57:28.328 --> 03:57:29.089]  That is Orwell.
[03:57:29.089 --> 03:57:30.029]  That is gaslighting.
[03:57:30.029 --> 03:57:31.790]  And hopefully everybody can recognize this.
[03:57:31.790 --> 03:57:36.913]  Hopefully everybody has enough common sense and enough IQ points left.
[03:57:37.617 --> 03:57:40.138]  To figure that out, what's staring everybody in the face?
[03:57:40.138 --> 03:57:41.659]  This is the Alex Jones Show, don't go anywhere.
[03:57:41.659 --> 03:57:43.180]  This is Jay Dyer, I'm Jason Alces.
[03:57:43.180 --> 03:57:46.542]  Follow me on YouTube, follow me on social media, and also support Alex in the store.
[03:57:46.542 --> 03:57:54.646]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[03:57:55.346 --> 03:57:59.809]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our elections seriously.
[03:57:59.809 --> 03:58:03.411]  It's election month, Alex.
[03:58:03.411 --> 03:58:04.971]  It's not election day.
[03:58:04.971 --> 03:58:06.072]  And that's the problem.
[03:58:06.072 --> 03:58:09.414]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[03:58:09.414 --> 03:58:18.619]  They illegally changed state elections, mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[03:58:18.619 --> 03:58:20.640]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[03:58:20.640 --> 03:58:24.282]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[03:58:24.882 --> 03:58:42.867]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[03:58:42.867 --> 03:58:45.608]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[03:58:47.387 --> 03:58:54.332]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[03:58:54.332 --> 03:59:00.216]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[03:59:00.216 --> 03:59:06.560]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[03:59:06.880 --> 03:59:14.105]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[03:59:14.105 --> 03:59:24.393]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[03:59:24.813 --> 03:59:33.817]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[03:59:33.817 --> 03:59:40.400]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[03:59:40.400 --> 03:59:46.603]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[03:59:48.877 --> 03:59:54.789]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
