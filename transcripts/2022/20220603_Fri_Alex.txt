[00:00.000 --> 00:24.400]  Thanks to you kids, we now know the virus is a hoax.
[00:24.400 --> 00:28.720]  They included flu, pneumonia and other infections to boost the numbers.
[00:28.720 --> 00:30.440]  Let's find out who is really behind it all.
[00:30.440 --> 00:34.160]  Like, President Trump is definitely behind one of these phantoms.
[00:34.160 --> 00:38.360]  Oh, she's pink.
[00:38.360 --> 00:41.040]  Dr. Fauci.
[00:41.040 --> 00:45.800]  Like I thought doctors were supposed to help people, not scare them.
[00:45.800 --> 00:47.760]  Microsoft's Bill Gates.
[00:47.760 --> 00:52.920]  Not only a computer guy, he's a notorious vaccine pusher who wants to reduce the world's
[00:52.920 --> 00:53.920]  population.
[00:53.920 --> 00:58.480]  I get it, so Bill Gates wanted to vaccinate everyone after Fauci convinced them there
[00:58.480 --> 01:00.200]  was a deadly disease outbreak.
[01:00.200 --> 01:01.200]  That's diabolical.
[01:01.200 --> 01:03.080]  Yeah, that sounds pretty bad.
[01:03.080 --> 01:07.920]  Don't worry kids, these globalists won't get away with their pandemic hoax this time,
[01:07.920 --> 01:12.600]  where they're going, they'll be locked up for a long good while in the big house.
[01:12.600 --> 01:13.600]  Yeah.
[01:13.600 --> 01:16.880]  Better than a rock round at home.
[01:16.880 --> 01:22.480]  Imagine a virus, the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you are due
[01:22.480 --> 01:23.480]  alone at the cure.
[01:23.480 --> 01:28.280]  But if your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such a weapon?
[01:28.280 --> 01:35.840]  A newly elected government seeking power and control develops a secret bio weapon and launches
[01:35.840 --> 01:42.960]  it against its own population to establish authoritarian rule and to blame the attack
[01:42.960 --> 01:45.720]  on their political enemies.
[01:45.720 --> 01:52.760]  Taking pages right out of the 20th century, we see this fictional dictatorship not just
[01:52.760 --> 01:58.200]  seeking to dominate and control the population, but to be seen as saviors of the very people
[01:58.200 --> 02:05.040]  that they are dumbing down, enslaving, imprisoning, and killing.
[02:05.040 --> 02:12.680]  The writers had a deep historical well to work from in just the 20th century, with monsters
[02:12.680 --> 02:21.240]  like Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez, Kim Jong-un, who don't
[02:21.240 --> 02:26.480]  just seek to dominate and control the very lives and thoughts of their minions, but who
[02:26.480 --> 02:31.360]  also want to be seen as the saviour by the very people who are their slaves.
[02:31.360 --> 02:37.200]  Tonight, I will speak directly to these people and make the situation perfectly clear to
[02:37.200 --> 02:38.200]  them.
[02:38.200 --> 02:42.760]  The security of this nation depends on complete and total compliance.
[02:42.760 --> 02:48.160]  So of course, in the film, those that release the bio weapon on their own population that
[02:48.160 --> 02:51.480]  they're preying on also have the cure.
[02:51.480 --> 02:57.840]  Low and behold, America, some believed it was the work of God himself, but it was a
[02:57.840 --> 03:03.200]  pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members that made them all obscenely
[03:03.200 --> 03:04.200]  rich.
[03:04.200 --> 03:09.400]  But the end result, the true genius of the plan was the fear.
[03:09.400 --> 03:13.440]  Fear became the ultimate tool of this government and through it, our politician was ultimately
[03:13.440 --> 03:17.520]  appointed to the newly created position of the high chancellor.
[03:17.520 --> 03:22.440]  In V for Vendetta, we truly see art imitating life.
[03:22.440 --> 03:28.400]  This is clearly an offensive, biological warfare agent.
[03:28.400 --> 03:33.000]  This is only the beginning to train you to be locked down so in the future when the really
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.880]  deadly bio weapons are released and billions begin dying, you sit there believing governments
[03:37.880 --> 03:41.800]  and corporations are actually your saviour and are going to shepherd you and protect
[03:41.800 --> 03:45.360]  you when in truth they're Judas goats leading you into the slaughter.
[03:45.360 --> 03:50.120]  In the midst of the worst health crisis we're facing in more than a century, don't tell
[03:50.120 --> 03:53.680]  your supporters don't be afraid of COVID.
[03:53.680 --> 04:05.920]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[04:05.920 --> 04:09.680]  Don't tell your supporters don't be afraid of COVID.
[04:09.680 --> 04:11.680]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[04:11.680 --> 04:23.120]  I just want to say they gave me Regeneron, we have hundreds of thousands of doses that
[04:23.120 --> 04:27.280]  are just about ready and if you're in the hospital and you're feeling really bad, we're
[04:27.280 --> 04:31.240]  going to work it so that you get them and you're going to get them free and especially
[04:31.240 --> 04:45.640]  if you're a senior, we're going to hit you.
[04:45.640 --> 04:50.360]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID, everyone should be afraid of COVID, everyone should
[04:50.360 --> 04:51.360]  be afraid of COVID.
[04:51.360 --> 05:00.360]  Is there no one who can tell them don't do this?

[05:57.160 --> 06:14.280]  Thanks for being part of the TEM of the Spear.
[06:14.280 --> 06:23.960]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones, all of the major factors
[06:23.960 --> 06:28.240]  are aligning and the globalists have launched their tyrannical world government and the
[06:28.240 --> 06:33.440]  designed orchestrated collapse of civilization as we know it.
[06:33.440 --> 06:37.880]  Last week we had the Davos group and the UN meeting to announce a world government biomedical
[06:37.880 --> 06:39.720]  tyranny.
[06:39.720 --> 06:45.200]  This week they were meeting in Davos again to coordinate and now in the suburb of DC and
[06:45.200 --> 06:52.240]  Chantilly, Virginia, the Bilderberg group is meeting and there's no corporate press coverage
[06:52.240 --> 06:58.880]  of it, infowarstore.com is reporting on it, Breitbart.com is reporting on it and that's
[06:58.880 --> 06:59.880]  it.
[06:59.880 --> 07:04.800]  I've covered personally three Bilderberg group meetings in Chantilly, Virginia, every four
[07:04.800 --> 07:09.760]  years they don't meet in Europe, they meet every fourth year in DC and this time they
[07:09.760 --> 07:14.160]  put out a press release about what they're discussing there.
[07:14.160 --> 07:20.880]  Just a decade ago Mainstream News was still saying the Bilderberg group did not exist ladies
[07:20.880 --> 07:24.080]  and gentlemen and who was the head of the Bilderberg group?
[07:24.080 --> 07:30.560]  Well, it of course was Klaus Schwab, ladies and gentlemen, so we're going to be getting
[07:30.560 --> 07:35.920]  into that and understanding who was behind the push for gun control and open borders
[07:35.920 --> 07:42.840]  and devalued currencies and forced inoculations and so much more today, we will get into that
[07:42.840 --> 07:45.240]  at the bottom of the hour.
[07:45.240 --> 07:49.880]  We have more major geoengineering news as major governments admit they're not just spraying
[07:49.880 --> 07:56.320]  chemicals into the air, they're spraying biocides or pesticides that attack all life.
[07:56.320 --> 08:00.640]  That is in government reports out of the EU and Spain, more has come out since we spent
[08:00.640 --> 08:05.480]  an hour on that yesterday, same groups, same organizations running that.
[08:05.480 --> 08:11.320]  We obviously have the big story that I'm going to start covering next segment and that is
[08:11.320 --> 08:17.200]  Joe Biden's treasonous declaration of war against the right to keep and bear arms, the
[08:17.200 --> 08:26.160]  Revolutionary War after a long train of usurpations and abuses started in 1776 when the Red Codes
[08:26.160 --> 08:33.640]  came to take the guns at Lexington and at Concord and now they have declared they're
[08:33.640 --> 08:37.480]  coming for the guns, got a bunch of clubs of Democrats in Congress, an open committee
[08:37.480 --> 08:42.720]  hearing saying we don't care what you do, we don't care what the Supreme Court says.
[08:42.720 --> 08:48.200]  These are quotes, we are going to take all your semi-autos and register all the rest
[08:48.200 --> 08:52.600]  and we know that's a formula worldwide that they've done in the UK, Australia, New Zealand
[08:52.600 --> 09:00.440]  and countless other places, Italy, they then take the guns once they've registered them
[09:00.440 --> 09:03.760]  and so it is all going down right now.
[09:03.760 --> 09:10.520]  We'll also be covering, as the invasion enters the 100th day, Russia now holds 20% of Ukraine,
[09:10.520 --> 09:19.520]  Zelensky now admits, but the key is that area is 90% of oil and gas refineries and control
[09:19.520 --> 09:27.880]  of all the major ports to the Black Sea, so Russia has basically cut off Ukraine and is
[09:27.880 --> 09:36.800]  in control of its economy and mainline analysts are saying Putin has already won.
[09:36.800 --> 09:44.240]  Meanwhile Biden has approved long-range missiles to target Russia, Russia is calling out a very
[09:44.240 --> 09:50.920]  serious act of war, this is deteriorating very, very quickly, we're going to be laying
[09:50.920 --> 09:57.200]  all of that out today and opening the phones up in the second hour.
[09:57.200 --> 10:02.320]  A very informative, very intelligent lady, Jenna Ellis, one of Trump's main impeachment
[10:02.320 --> 10:08.480]  lawyers will be joining us to cover a host of issues in the third hour, Biden attacking
[10:08.480 --> 10:14.720]  the Second Amendment, free speech issues are under attack, Pride Month, the LGBT agenda,
[10:14.720 --> 10:21.120]  going after kids, the Supreme Court decision and so much more coming up with her in the
[10:21.120 --> 10:22.960]  third hour today.
[10:22.960 --> 10:28.400]  First hour jam packed with news analysis, second hour jam packed with news and your calls,
[10:28.400 --> 10:33.280]  third hour Jenna Ellis and then a lot more coming up obviously in the fourth hour as
[10:33.280 --> 10:36.840]  news develops and unfolds.
[10:36.840 --> 10:43.440]  We've got a lot of news also dealing with COVID-19, in fact every day the news just
[10:43.440 --> 10:50.480]  gets bigger, that stack is absolutely insane and we're going to be hitting that in the
[10:50.480 --> 10:58.320]  final segment of this hour, wait till you hear this, I have der Spiegel, I have the
[10:58.320 --> 11:05.640]  Boston Globe, I have the L.A. Times, I have countless publications admitting record numbers
[11:05.640 --> 11:13.280]  of people in the hospitals, record numbers of ER visits, all time record highs, double
[11:13.280 --> 11:22.360]  what it was just a few years ago with unexplained heart attacks, blood clots, strokes including
[11:22.360 --> 11:27.400]  any young people and of course what did all the scientists warn would happen, what did
[11:27.400 --> 11:33.360]  the CDC's own document in October of 2020 say before the injections began, a list of
[11:33.360 --> 11:39.720]  what is now plaguing everyone, 100% confirmed with all the insurance actuaries, a 40 plus
[11:39.720 --> 11:50.200]  percent death rate in 18 to 64 the working age, unprecedented information, we're going
[11:50.200 --> 11:55.600]  to be breaking down, that's just one area of the stack.
[11:55.600 --> 12:00.080]  They are admitting and it's already happening in New York and California and other areas
[12:00.080 --> 12:05.840]  that the lockdowns are coming back, the mass mandates are coming back, children are being
[12:05.840 --> 12:11.320]  barred and high schoolers from graduation ceremonies have not been injected with at
[12:11.320 --> 12:21.640]  least three of the deadly shots, it is unbelievable what we have in that stack as well, but I'm
[12:21.640 --> 12:27.600]  going to get this out here right now ladies and gentlemen because it's so incredibly important,
[12:27.600 --> 12:31.840]  we're taking George Soros and the New World Order on at point blank range and to get to
[12:31.840 --> 12:35.880]  you they've got to get through us and they see us as a media outlet as the number one
[12:35.880 --> 12:40.840]  enemy because we've got their number and we've studied them and as long as you stand with
[12:40.840 --> 12:45.240]  us and as long as you spread the word and as long as you financially keep us on air

[12:49.280 --> 12:54.880]  we've ever done is now happening, the people's minds, their intellects are now more open than
[12:54.880 --> 13:00.520]  they've ever been to the truth, but I can't do it without your support so I make it really
[13:00.520 --> 13:01.520]  easy.

[18:05.600 --> 18:11.400]  you that we've been vindicated and that world government and its tyrannical aim of depopulation

[18:46.480 --> 18:50.240]  So I want to thank you all for your support and I want to encourage you all to be part
[18:50.240 --> 18:58.520]  of history and to get this historic memento that keeps us on air at m4wars.com or 1776coin.com
[18:58.520 --> 19:00.080]  while you still can.
[19:00.080 --> 19:05.440]  The eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans, they financed
[19:05.440 --> 19:11.280]  major universities, they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda
[19:11.280 --> 19:16.200]  of the New York Times, other major newspapers, that the family as we know it is a bad thing
[19:16.200 --> 19:22.280]  and must be ended and the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching
[19:22.280 --> 19:26.520]  women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is
[19:26.520 --> 19:31.800]  a bad thing and I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national
[19:31.800 --> 19:35.520]  daughter, my wife makes dinner a lot of times but I like to make it as well, I love to make
[19:35.520 --> 19:40.160]  breakfast and literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family
[19:40.160 --> 19:45.680]  and be nurturative and then all sit down together and have the communal event and that's what
[19:45.680 --> 19:51.680]  the system is attacking and bombarding is our normal biological actions and coming together.
[19:51.680 --> 19:57.240]  They really are sick, evil scientific cult of ill that want to domesticate us and turn
[19:57.240 --> 20:04.160]  us into lab rats, we cannot let this continue.
[20:04.160 --> 20:15.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:15.480 --> 20:19.200]  The treasonous declaration of war against your right to protect yourself and your family
[20:19.200 --> 20:22.880]  by the corrupt loveless that are running this country on the ground and use taxpayer money
[20:22.880 --> 20:28.480]  to pay for an army of bodyguards both public and private has been made, it is high treason,
[20:28.480 --> 20:30.200]  Biden must be impeached.
[20:30.200 --> 20:36.360]  That's what the overwhelming majority of American people believe we must do.
[20:36.360 --> 20:42.680]  Here's what the families in Buffalo and Uvaldi in Texas told us we must do.
[20:42.680 --> 20:48.800]  We need to ban assault weapons in high capacity magazines and if we can't ban assault weapons
[20:48.800 --> 20:54.400]  then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.
[20:54.400 --> 21:01.080]  Strengthen the background checks and act safe storage law and red flag laws, repeal the immunity
[21:01.080 --> 21:08.560]  that protects gun manufacturers from liability, address the mental health crisis deep into
[21:08.560 --> 21:15.040]  the trauma of gun violence and as a consequence of that violence.
[21:15.040 --> 21:22.200]  These are rational common sense measures, here's what it all means, it all means this,
[21:22.200 --> 21:27.120]  we should reinstate the assault weapons ban in high capacity magazines that we passed in
[21:27.120 --> 21:38.760]  1994 with bipartisan support in Congress and the support of law enforcement.
[21:38.760 --> 21:42.560]  Our lives the same as you did when you were kids but we can't let you get away with this
[21:42.560 --> 21:44.560]  anymore.
[21:44.560 --> 21:49.720]  Enough is enough, enough of you telling us that school shootings are a fact of life when
[21:49.720 --> 21:53.920]  every other country like ours has virtually ended it.
[21:53.920 --> 21:58.760]  Enough of you blaming mental illness and then defunding mental health care in this country.
[21:58.760 --> 22:04.080]  Enough of your thoughts and prayers, enough, enough.
[22:04.080 --> 22:08.560]  You will not stop us from advancing the Protecting Our Kids Act today.
[22:08.560 --> 22:14.440]  You will not stop us from passing it in the house next week and you will not stop us there.
[22:14.440 --> 22:18.880]  If the filibuster obstructs us, we will abolish it.
[22:18.880 --> 22:23.920]  If the Supreme Court objects, we will expand it and we will not rest until we have taken
[22:23.920 --> 22:28.040]  weapons of war out of circulation in our communities.
[22:28.040 --> 22:33.960]  Each and every day we will do whatever it takes to end gun violence, whatever it takes.
[22:33.960 --> 22:39.640]  What we will do is not fail the children of this country the way that you have failed us,
[22:39.640 --> 22:47.640]  the generations of Columbine, Sandy Hook, Parkland and Yvalde, I yield back, Madam Chair.
[22:47.640 --> 22:55.880]  Nadler, we've got the club coming up, the head of the committee, then says we can't
[22:55.880 --> 23:05.120]  trust 18-year-olds on any guns but they need to be able to join the military and kill people.
[23:05.120 --> 23:12.480]  I was hunting by myself when I was 8-years-old with a 12-gauge shotgun and bringing Dove
[23:12.480 --> 23:16.600]  back to the house for my grandmother to cook for dinner.
[23:16.600 --> 23:24.800]  I was shooting shotguns when I was 4-years-old and they have domesticated so much of this
[23:24.800 --> 23:25.800]  country.
[23:25.800 --> 23:28.600]  We can't let this continue.
[23:28.600 --> 23:33.600]  The worst school shooting numbers we've ever had is 118 in one year.
[23:33.600 --> 23:36.680]  That's counting mass shootings, period, that was Vegas.
[23:36.680 --> 23:43.080]  All numbers that year a few years ago with 100,000 plus a year dying of drug overdoses.
[23:43.080 --> 23:48.360]  These people don't give a rat's ass about any of that.
[23:48.360 --> 23:50.480]  Incredible.
[23:50.480 --> 23:57.840]  And so it is on the World Economic Forum's top agenda to disarm the American people under
[23:57.840 --> 24:02.400]  the UN Treaty Uniteer.
[24:02.400 --> 24:07.320]  And I've said it over and over again, Biden's cut off our energy.
[24:07.320 --> 24:12.000]  He's completely opened our borders and violated federal law and allowed massive human smuggling.
[24:12.000 --> 24:17.480]  We got him cut and dry impeachment.
[24:17.480 --> 24:19.920]  And Republican leadership says we don't have the votes.
[24:19.920 --> 24:21.040]  It doesn't matter.
[24:21.040 --> 24:23.920]  Going into the election you take the narrative away from them.
[24:23.920 --> 24:26.160]  You point out what they've done.
[24:26.160 --> 24:32.120]  Polls show 90-some percent of Americans don't care about January 6th and 80-plus percent
[24:32.120 --> 24:34.080]  don't care about Ukraine.
[24:34.080 --> 24:39.400]  They care about the inflation and the baby formula shortages and the open border.
[24:39.400 --> 24:42.320]  Plus it's unconstitutional and illegal what Biden's doing.
[24:42.320 --> 24:50.520]  It's our duty to impeach him or to try and it will force the issue and prepare the way
[24:50.520 --> 24:54.880]  after the midterms with the win of the House and Senate for Republicans to actually remove
[24:54.880 --> 24:55.880]  him.
[24:55.880 --> 24:58.800]  And they say, well, we'll just get Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi.
[24:58.800 --> 25:01.000]  We'll get rid of them too.
[25:01.000 --> 25:06.800]  It's your duty when someone violates the Constitution and pisses in the face of our hard-fought
[25:06.800 --> 25:13.640]  rights to stand up against it and to stop it.
[25:13.640 --> 25:17.840]  Not to aid to bet the damn thing, excuse me.
[25:17.840 --> 25:21.560]  So it must happen.
[25:21.560 --> 25:32.520]  Here is Nadler, again, saying we can't let 18-year-olds have guns, but they need to
[25:32.520 --> 25:39.160]  register for selective service because they need to be able to be forced into the military.
[25:39.160 --> 25:42.640]  Oxymoronic murder of logic in your face.
[25:42.640 --> 25:44.920]  Here it is.
[25:44.920 --> 25:47.600]  We recognize different ages for different purposes.
[25:47.600 --> 25:49.840]  We recognize 18 for the draft.
[25:49.840 --> 25:53.840]  We recognize 16 for driving in some states.
[25:53.840 --> 25:59.000]  We recognize 21 for drinking.
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.920]  So we recognize different ages for different purposes.
[26:01.920 --> 26:03.080]  That's all I want to say.
[26:03.080 --> 26:04.080]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[26:04.080 --> 26:05.080]  Could I have a second to engage that?
[26:05.080 --> 26:06.080]  Certainly.
[26:06.080 --> 26:07.840]  I'll yield to the gentleman for good talking.
[26:07.840 --> 26:12.440]  Would the chairman join me in cosponsoring a bill to raise the draft age to 21?
[26:12.440 --> 26:13.440]  No.
[26:13.440 --> 26:18.080]  But the chairman feels that their brains aren't fully formed at 18, 19, and 20.
[26:18.080 --> 26:25.720]  The research does indicate that, in certain respects, but the selective service needs...
[26:25.720 --> 26:28.880]  I mean, if the country needs people, it needs people.
[26:28.880 --> 26:31.080]  It needs people whose brains aren't fully formed?
[26:31.080 --> 26:32.480]  In certain respects, yes.
[26:32.480 --> 26:35.680]  I yield back.
[26:35.680 --> 26:38.080]  Hoping that mine is fully formed at 40.
[26:38.080 --> 26:39.080]  I hope so.
[26:39.080 --> 26:40.080]  Do you, Mr. Gates?
[26:40.080 --> 26:41.080]  I hope so.
[26:41.080 --> 26:42.080]  Yeah, we won't put that to a vote.
[26:42.080 --> 26:43.080]  Why?
[26:43.080 --> 26:44.080]  Why?
[26:44.080 --> 26:50.080]  It's directly waging war on logic.
[26:50.080 --> 27:00.920]  118 people is too many to die in America's worst mass shooting year ever.
[27:00.920 --> 27:08.040]  But when it comes to real death in this country, it's not even a blip on the radar screen.
[27:08.040 --> 27:09.720]  And they know that.
[27:09.720 --> 27:18.240]  But Stalin said, one man dies, it's a tragedy, 10,000 die, it's a statistic.
[27:18.240 --> 27:26.680]  And that's absolutely true, what that tyrant dictator had to say.
[27:26.680 --> 27:35.280]  They can pull on your heartstrings all day long about dead children.
[27:35.280 --> 27:43.400]  And then it turns out, six people have reported, he said he was going to shoot the school up,
[27:43.400 --> 27:46.600]  and the police knew, and they did nothing.
[27:46.600 --> 27:52.240]  Just like the white supremacists that killed tenants and black people at a Buffalo grocery
[27:52.240 --> 27:56.800]  store three weeks ago.
[27:56.800 --> 28:04.520]  And now they are passing a bill in California with the governor's support to not report
[28:04.520 --> 28:06.800]  threats of mass shootings.
[28:06.800 --> 28:12.360]  You cannot make this up.
[28:12.360 --> 28:15.320]  They want to kill you in the womb.
[28:15.320 --> 28:17.400]  They want to kill the old people of euthanasia.
[28:17.400 --> 28:22.240]  Bill Gates tells us there's too many people, but they love us so much they want to take
[28:22.240 --> 28:31.200]  our guns to protect, on average, 47 children murdered each year in cold blood in the big
[28:31.200 --> 28:35.040]  flashing neon sign of public schools.
[28:35.040 --> 28:37.080]  Crazy people, it's an option.
[28:37.080 --> 28:42.200]  Don't die by suicide by cop, don't kill yourself, don't kill a bunch of kids, you're a devil,
[28:42.200 --> 28:44.760]  you're a devil, kill kids, kill kids.
[28:44.760 --> 28:48.720]  And we know from the statistics and studies, the more media coverage there is of mass shootings,
[28:48.720 --> 28:49.720]  the more it happens.
[28:49.720 --> 28:53.680]  So it's still very rare, but it is going up, because we've got an evil problem.
[28:53.680 --> 28:59.440]  All right, the Bilderberg group meeting in secret in D.C., straight ahead, say with us.
[28:59.440 --> 29:04.760]  The first ten amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791.
[29:04.760 --> 29:09.680]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press.
[29:09.680 --> 29:15.920]  Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference
[29:15.920 --> 29:18.560]  and restraint by the government.
[29:18.560 --> 29:25.040]  231 years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious attack.
[29:25.040 --> 29:27.600]  GCN is under attack.
[29:27.600 --> 29:32.240]  Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not want you to know the truth.
[29:32.240 --> 29:38.400]  I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up and help us defend our right to
[29:38.400 --> 29:40.600]  continue telling you the truth.
[29:40.600 --> 29:42.080]  Would you like to join us?
[29:42.080 --> 29:47.600]  If so, please consider visiting savegcn.com.
[29:47.600 --> 29:48.600]  Savegcn.com.
[29:48.600 --> 29:54.760]  You may click follow, share, give and pray.
[29:54.760 --> 29:56.800]  You may select all of those choices.
[29:56.800 --> 29:57.800]  I'm Vincent Finnelli.
[29:57.800 --> 30:05.080]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a
[30:05.080 --> 30:07.200]  rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire.
[30:07.200 --> 30:10.440]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[30:10.440 --> 30:11.440]  You see it every year.
[30:11.440 --> 30:13.840]  Thirty different tax returns, thirty different answers.
[30:13.840 --> 30:16.640]  Fifty different tax returns, fifty different answers.
[30:16.640 --> 30:22.440]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[30:22.440 --> 30:25.840]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[30:25.840 --> 30:26.840]  this and knowing this.
[30:26.840 --> 30:31.680]  So, it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[30:31.680 --> 30:37.760]  to be able to do things tax-wise that's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of
[30:37.760 --> 30:38.760]  your money.
[30:38.760 --> 30:43.480]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[30:43.480 --> 30:50.600]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com,

[32:05.160 --> 32:10.200]  remind you that we've been vindicated and that world government and its tyrannical aim
[32:10.200 --> 32:13.640]  of depopulation is now out of the open.
[32:13.640 --> 32:18.360]  Everything you and I have done together has been historic, and we cannot continue in this
[32:18.360 --> 32:20.160]  fight without your support.
[32:20.160 --> 32:24.240]  I want to encourage you all to be part of history right now, while you still can, get

[32:43.960 --> 32:46.520]  the most critical time in our 28-year history.
[32:46.520 --> 32:50.360]  So I want to thank you all for your support and I want to encourage you all to be part
[32:50.360 --> 32:56.720]  of history and to get this historic memento that keeps us on air at infoworkstore.com or

[33:03.720 --> 33:10.720]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:33.720 --> 33:45.720]  A lot of people got arrested, a lot of people got persecuted, a lot of people got attacked
[33:45.720 --> 33:52.680]  and demonized to bring you the information we've got right here today on this June 3rd,
[33:52.680 --> 33:55.080]  Friday edition.
[33:55.080 --> 34:02.880]  It was Westbrook Brooke Pegler, Westbrook Pegler back in the 1960s who was a major syndicated
[34:02.880 --> 34:06.040]  political writer.
[34:06.040 --> 34:10.960]  And his sources started pointing out meetings in Europe but also meetings every four years
[34:10.960 --> 34:18.880]  in the US on the East Coast were hundreds of members of the Dutch royal family and the
[34:18.880 --> 34:28.120]  British royal family and the presidents and prime ministers would rent out hotels and
[34:28.120 --> 34:33.800]  block them all off and then meet for four days and he went and covered it for a decade
[34:33.800 --> 34:39.080]  before he retired and could never figure out the name or who it was.
[34:39.080 --> 34:47.600]  Then Anthony Sutton, the head of congressional archives was given inside information from
[34:47.600 --> 34:52.760]  Charlotte, Israel whose father and grandfather were skull and bones members and they knew
[34:52.760 --> 34:57.800]  the name, Bilderberg group.
[34:57.800 --> 35:08.120]  So it wasn't until the 70s that we even knew the name of the organization.
[35:08.120 --> 35:14.600]  And now we know it, it's like passé, Info Wars isn't up covering Bilderberg this year.
[35:14.600 --> 35:18.920]  No one's covering it physically, we're talking about it, Paul Watts is doing reports about
[35:18.920 --> 35:25.480]  it, Kit Daniels is, Reitbart did, nobody else I know of and why is that important?
[35:25.480 --> 35:30.520]  Well if you're ruled by a shadowy group and they didn't want people to know they existed
[35:30.520 --> 35:36.280]  because the devil's biggest trick is convincing the world he didn't exist.
[35:36.280 --> 35:43.600]  And then going back about 15 years ago the media went from denying it existed because
[35:43.600 --> 35:49.080]  DrudgeReport.com, back when Drudge was running it or whatever's happened, I'm not sure, back
[35:49.080 --> 35:52.680]  when Drudge was still in charge of it or back before Drudge changed his mind, I haven't
[35:52.680 --> 35:58.480]  talked about Drudge in years, I don't know, we're showing footage in 2013, North of London
[35:58.480 --> 36:06.640]  covering Bilderberg, thousands of protesters, media showed up and they went from denying
[36:06.640 --> 36:13.120]  it existed about 15 years ago in the London Guardian and a lot of publications to saying
[36:13.120 --> 36:21.360]  it existed, but for a good five years there was a paradox where the New York Times and
[36:21.360 --> 36:29.080]  the Washington Post and the Associated Press still said it did not exist.
[36:29.080 --> 36:39.840]  The New York Times again in 2008 when it was in Chantilly, Virginia and we went and covered
[36:39.840 --> 36:45.400]  it, they had helicopters and Marines and Secret Service and everybody said Jones went to a
[36:45.400 --> 36:52.280]  hotel complex in Virginia outside D.C. and had a full-on hallucination, it didn't exist.
[36:52.280 --> 36:58.640]  They actually said Jones is insane, he imagined men with black sunglasses and earpieces even
[36:58.640 --> 37:02.200]  though he had the footage, even though I stayed inside the hotel when it started and they
[37:02.200 --> 37:06.840]  grabbed me and threw me out, nobody ever got away with that, by the grace of God we did.
[37:06.840 --> 37:15.720]  It's like Bohemian Grove, the forces with us.
[37:15.720 --> 37:23.480]  Imagine how hard they have fought and fought and fought and fought and fought and fought
[37:23.480 --> 37:31.160]  to even have its existence known and its former head and off and on for more than 20 years
[37:31.160 --> 37:38.840]  he was the head of it, it rotates, Prince Bernhardt, the husband of the Queen of the
[37:38.840 --> 37:43.840]  Netherlands, he was the head for the first 30 years or so, but Klaus Schwab headed it
[37:43.840 --> 37:44.920]  up for over a decade.
[37:44.920 --> 37:49.360]  So when you see the Debo's group, the World Economic Forum, the New World Order, all their
[37:49.360 --> 37:52.760]  open announcements were going to put ships in you and you're going to eat bugs and you'll
[37:52.760 --> 38:01.120]  own nothing and have nothing and love it and there'll be no more any of this.
[38:01.120 --> 38:08.480]  Or that that is the mouthpiece of the Bilderberg group and it is the progenitor or the heart
[38:08.480 --> 38:10.360]  of this whole thing.
[38:10.360 --> 38:14.680]  And so it stuck up on me because I'm so busy looking at them out in the open at Debo's
[38:14.680 --> 38:19.360]  group and the UN announcing World Government, announcing censorship and forced inoculations
[38:19.360 --> 38:24.960]  and all of it and saying Klaus Schwab last week, we control the world and the future,
[38:24.960 --> 38:29.600]  we are now in control, we have penetrated the governments, we own the leadership, no
[38:29.600 --> 38:36.480]  one can stop us, no more the public has power, we have the power, I mean, these are quotes.
[38:36.480 --> 38:41.600]  Dictatorial James Bond villain announcements.
[38:41.600 --> 38:49.240]  But the original OG organization has met in DC over and over again in Chantilly, this
[38:49.240 --> 38:55.480]  time they didn't, we checked, no one knows where it's at, but we do.
[38:55.480 --> 39:00.560]  It's the Grand Orient inside DC, the Hong Kong government rented the whole thing out, it's
[39:00.560 --> 39:06.280]  got Secret Service and troops and everything all around it and that's reportedly where
[39:06.280 --> 39:08.960]  they are meeting right now.
[39:08.960 --> 39:11.320]  And again, why would they hide themselves?
[39:11.320 --> 39:20.600]  Why would they not want you to know that several hundred world leaders are meeting in secret
[39:20.600 --> 39:27.800]  right now in DC because once you identify them and the fact they control your government
[39:27.800 --> 39:31.360]  and the fact that they're taking your freedoms, it's game over because you now know they're
[39:31.360 --> 39:35.720]  the ones that are doing it to you and I know as a regular listener, you've heard me harp
[39:35.720 --> 39:40.440]  on this a thousand times and you already know this.
[39:40.440 --> 39:46.920]  But the general public still doesn't, we've got exclusive details of this being posted
[39:46.920 --> 39:51.920]  at infowars.com and I'll be honest with you, it's stuck up on me, Paul Watson this morning
[39:51.920 --> 39:55.080]  we were talking and he goes, yeah, I'm going to report on Bilderberg and I went, oh, I forgot
[39:55.080 --> 40:05.520]  they always meet the first few days in June and sure enough they are and it's been four
[40:05.520 --> 40:08.600]  years since they met in the U.S.
[40:08.600 --> 40:15.560]  So now is the time for that meeting to take place and who's at that meeting?
[40:15.560 --> 40:21.320]  Well, it's very revealing.
[40:21.320 --> 40:27.800]  Senator Kristen Sinema, Finnish Prime Minister Martin Sanna, Pfizer CEO and others attend
[40:27.800 --> 40:35.280]  Bilderberg meeting in DC, CIA director, the Carnegie Endowment, all of them.
[40:35.280 --> 40:43.920]  Here's Breitbart, global elites converge in Washington, DC for Bilderberg group meeting.
[40:43.920 --> 40:48.120]  Christina Freeland is really the Prime Minister of Canada, works directly for Klaus Schwab,
[40:48.120 --> 40:53.200]  she's on the board of WEF, she's there.
[40:53.200 --> 40:59.840]  And they've got a press release at Bilderbergmeanings.org, see about 15 years ago they couldn't cover
[40:59.840 --> 41:05.720]  it up anymore so they started publishing their agenda and what they were doing, but only
[41:05.720 --> 41:16.760]  lapdog press is allowed and we have the full list of participants, who's who of globalist
[41:16.760 --> 41:19.760]  parasites?
[41:19.760 --> 41:26.920]  Paul Watson tweeted, the CEO of Pfizer, the head of the CIA, the director of the E-N-C-N-S-C
[41:26.920 --> 41:30.960]  and the VP of Facebook, the king of Holland and the secretary general of NATO are all
[41:30.960 --> 41:36.320]  secretly meeting right now behind closed doors in DC, it's called Bilderberg and on a single
[41:36.320 --> 41:42.560]  major media outlet has reported on it.
[41:42.560 --> 41:55.120]  So we've had major victories forcing all of this out in the open and we salute you all
[41:55.120 --> 42:01.200]  for keeping us on air to be able to expose this, but we come back, I want to get into
[42:01.200 --> 42:06.400]  their agenda that includes taking over your body and forcing deadly injections into you
[42:06.400 --> 42:11.080]  and how that ties into these treaties and how that ties in the latest COVID information
[42:11.080 --> 42:16.120]  that is just nightmarish, but the good news is we know it so we can expose it and fight
[42:16.120 --> 42:17.480]  it together.
[42:17.480 --> 42:23.880]  ERs reach record capacity as hospitals are inundated with patients, WHO's pandemic treaty, the
[42:23.880 --> 42:27.760]  international sovereignty and freedom, it all comes together because they're the ones
[42:27.760 --> 42:32.160]  in control, they're the captains of the ship, they're the ones running us into the ground
[42:32.160 --> 42:36.800]  and we are going to expose it all.
[42:36.800 --> 42:44.480]  Coming up here today on this historic broadcast, the economy, what's happening in Ukraine,
[42:44.480 --> 42:48.520]  what's happening with the attack on our children and the dehumanization, transhumanist movements,
[42:48.520 --> 42:56.160]  the transgender system, it's all coming up today on this Friday, June 3rd, 2022 transmission,
[42:56.160 --> 42:59.360]  banned.videoinfowars.com.
[42:59.360 --> 43:05.240]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right, people ask
[43:05.240 --> 43:09.600]  what's it like to be vindicated, well it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew
[43:09.600 --> 43:15.520]  this was coming, I tried to stop it and now everything I've talked about is going to become
[43:15.520 --> 43:21.520]  more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports
[43:21.520 --> 43:24.160]  and documents, it's now out of the open.
[43:24.160 --> 43:29.760]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[43:29.760 --> 43:30.760]  Group.
[43:30.760 --> 43:35.920]  So now the fight's out in the open, they're making their move because they know they're
[43:35.920 --> 43:39.480]  behind schedule, we're going to win this thing, God's watching, the children are counting
[43:39.480 --> 43:43.160]  on us, I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your
[43:43.160 --> 43:47.080]  prayer and your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[43:47.080 --> 43:51.480]  So I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the
[43:51.480 --> 43:53.760]  reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[43:53.760 --> 43:58.280]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[43:58.280 --> 43:59.280]  your efforts.
[43:59.280 --> 44:03.000]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported info wars financially with
[44:03.000 --> 44:04.960]  word of mouth and prayer.
[44:04.960 --> 44:08.400]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[44:08.400 --> 44:14.320]  caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you, humanity has a real fighting
[44:14.320 --> 44:15.320]  chance.

[45:57.120 --> 46:01.080]  Thanks for being part of the tip of the spear.
[46:01.080 --> 46:10.080]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the chains
[46:10.080 --> 46:15.120]  that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations has put
[46:15.120 --> 46:16.120]  in place.
[46:16.120 --> 46:21.640]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[46:21.640 --> 46:27.120]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[46:27.120 --> 46:30.440]  faces from the light of the sun.
[46:30.440 --> 46:38.160]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[46:38.160 --> 46:42.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[46:42.600 --> 46:45.600]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[46:45.600 --> 46:49.480]  Cloud swab and the human admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[46:49.480 --> 46:52.320]  the world ID and carbon taxes.
[46:52.320 --> 46:54.480]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[46:54.480 --> 46:57.920]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[46:57.920 --> 47:03.680]  Non-compliance, non-compliance, non-compliance.
[47:03.680 --> 47:16.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:16.280 --> 47:25.800]  We're about to play a clip from the archives in 2013 just north of London at a huge hotel
[47:25.800 --> 47:32.080]  of state, more than 4,000 protesters, more than 100 media outlets showed up to expose
[47:32.080 --> 47:33.080]  the Bilderberg group.
[47:33.080 --> 47:36.880]  For the first time ever it was all over international headlines.
[47:36.880 --> 47:39.120]  We had exposed the shadow government.
[47:39.120 --> 47:46.240]  Now fast forward only a decade and this world government through the Davos group is openly
[47:46.240 --> 47:50.760]  taking control of the planet and bragging they are in control of the planet.
[47:50.760 --> 47:55.520]  Total complete vindication for all of you that helped get the word out about Bilderberg.
[47:55.520 --> 47:57.280]  You are the tip of the spear.
[47:57.280 --> 47:58.280]  You are the resistance.
[47:58.280 --> 48:04.680]  Well, I kind of halfway expected something like this to happen because they've gone
[48:04.680 --> 48:09.680]  from being secret and saying anybody that talks about it as a cougar conspiracy terrorist
[48:09.680 --> 48:14.400]  to now, okay, we're real, but we're just a little political chat and so they want to
[48:14.400 --> 48:18.120]  hide and play in view and have David Cameron come here and who knows, Sarkozy may come
[48:18.120 --> 48:19.120]  here.
[48:19.120 --> 48:20.120]  The word is Bill Gates.
[48:20.120 --> 48:21.120]  It's going to be sneaking in.
[48:21.120 --> 48:25.080]  A lot of times there's 20, 30 to 50 people who aren't on the list and those are used
[48:25.080 --> 48:29.320]  as the real conflict of interest and that's who they'll have sneak in or land behind fences
[48:29.320 --> 48:30.820]  and helicopters.
[48:30.820 --> 48:36.080]  But the fact that Cameron is openly announcing as the head of a major state that he's going
[48:36.080 --> 48:37.360]  to be attending in the middle of it.
[48:37.360 --> 48:42.400]  I think this is Bilderberg pretty much going public and that's actually what I was told
[48:42.400 --> 48:46.560]  for my Senate sources and what I was told by a major Hollywood source through a member
[48:46.560 --> 48:52.640]  of the Bilderberg group that they are having a major debate about just opening up their
[48:52.640 --> 48:58.560]  entire operation to the press or at least the speeches they give that are Davos like.
[48:58.560 --> 49:04.000]  But it's the break off groups where the real collusion goes on, the price fixing, I mean
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.200]  there have been indictments before, there have been investigations back in the 70s with
[49:08.200 --> 49:13.080]  Lockheed and Prince Bernhard and jet deals with the Netherlands so that's the type of
[49:13.080 --> 49:19.720]  things that go on here and we've just been trying myself for 18 years to get the public
[49:19.720 --> 49:24.480]  to understand there are these types of super high level power broker meetings going on.
[49:24.480 --> 49:28.800]  It was Westbrook Pegler back in the 50s that happened to be on vacation and see a hotel
[49:28.800 --> 49:33.640]  walk down and people he knew, famous people, world leaders there and he was a syndicate
[49:33.640 --> 49:35.960]  of columnists and wrote about it and they said shut up.
[49:35.960 --> 49:40.360]  They said shut up, there's something above government and then it just grew from there.
[49:40.360 --> 49:43.320]  We didn't even know the name of it until about 35 years ago.
[49:43.320 --> 49:49.760]  I think that the influence of the Bilderberg group has waned because of exposure but it's
[49:49.760 --> 49:55.960]  waned even more in just the last few years and now it's completely evident today because
[49:55.960 --> 50:01.040]  of the fact that the founding members have died like Prince Bernhard or they're so old
[50:01.040 --> 50:04.240]  like Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller but what we're really seeing is more than
[50:04.240 --> 50:09.240]  a death, we're seeing a passing of the torch to what I call Googleberg and we have insiders
[50:09.240 --> 50:10.240]  on that.
[50:10.240 --> 50:13.520]  There's a distinct amount while they threw us out days before it even started.
[50:13.520 --> 50:18.320]  We have sources in government that also confirmed with people that were in the hotel that worked
[50:18.320 --> 50:20.320]  there that it needed.
[50:20.320 --> 50:27.440]  All right, from the archive 10 years ago and here we are today living under the New World
[50:27.440 --> 50:31.440]  Order dictatorship now bevealing itself.
[50:31.440 --> 50:36.920]  So let's look at some of the things they're currently doing right now.
[50:36.920 --> 50:42.280]  The World Health Organization's Pandemic Treaty the end of national sovereignty and freedom
[50:42.280 --> 50:48.120]  the Von Mies Institute is an excellent analysis of that and Adon Salazar is reporting WHO
[50:48.120 --> 50:56.200]  forced to back down after numerous nations led by Bolsonaro in Brazil reject pandemic
[50:56.200 --> 50:59.680]  treaty that's on info wars.com.
[50:59.680 --> 51:05.160]  Meanwhile the main weapon they use is inflation and collapsing borders observers say Erdogan
[51:05.160 --> 51:10.000]  of Turkey using migrants as political weapon against Greece over one million migrants eligible
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.680]  to vote in upcoming Swedish national election.
[51:13.680 --> 51:17.360]  Federal Ethics Commission in Canada flooded with emails calling for investigation into
[51:17.360 --> 51:23.520]  WEF conspiracy the national post of Canada reports were identifying the enemy as you
[51:23.520 --> 51:27.640]  can see that's why they need election fraud and that's why they need to be able to manipulate
[51:27.640 --> 51:28.640]  things.
[51:28.640 --> 51:34.640]  Dominion voting machines in 16 states vulnerable to hacks US government cyber agency.
[51:34.640 --> 51:42.000]  Confirms so that's just some of the news on that front but let's look at what they're
[51:42.000 --> 51:48.640]  doing through the bio medical tyranny front that is extremely central to everything this
[51:48.640 --> 51:56.320]  enemy this depopulation cult of out of control filthy rich people are up to.
[51:56.320 --> 52:00.040]  I'll get more into this after we take calls into the next hour but I want to skip to the
[52:00.040 --> 52:04.520]  headlines now this is so big this is the Boston Globe again this is all over the
[52:04.520 --> 52:11.600]  foreign news it's all every western country that took the Moderna the Pfizer the AstraZeneca
[52:11.600 --> 52:17.080]  or the J&J shots that all grow spike proteins in the body that again the CDC's own documents
[52:17.080 --> 52:23.400]  in October of 2000 that are on their own website they predicted that all of this would indeed
[52:23.400 --> 52:29.920]  happen and now it has ERs reach record capacity as hospitals are inundated with patients they
[52:29.920 --> 52:34.800]  say it's way worse it's ever been it's double what it was the last two years they're having
[52:34.800 --> 52:38.640]  blood clots they're having heart attacks they're having strokes it's young people told people
[52:38.640 --> 52:43.560]  they say it's a mystery they just don't know what's happening here's the sun reporting
[52:43.560 --> 52:50.240]  the urgent warning to women under 40s after sharp rise and sudden killer blood clots and
[52:50.240 --> 52:59.800]  I know one of the top three famous bodybuilders out there who took the shots so he could go
[52:59.800 --> 53:06.240]  to the Arnold Classic last year and now blood clots have almost killed him and he was in
[53:06.240 --> 53:13.840]  perfect shape and a medical doctor I'll leave it at that so there you go scientists find
[53:13.840 --> 53:19.700]  world's first cure for heart attacks daily mail reports using same mRNA technology as
[53:19.700 --> 53:28.080]  COVID vaccines this is a summer saying a literal IQ test how dumb are you what will you put
[53:28.080 --> 53:36.600]  up with and we've got this clip executive director of Oxfam International at WEF's COVID
[53:36.600 --> 53:43.080]  statement executive director of Oxfam International at World Economic Forum says COVID has been
[53:43.080 --> 53:48.920]  one of the most profitable products ever we'll play the clip in a moment but it is a product
[53:48.920 --> 53:53.600]  it's a new kind miric virus that they control that creates a poisonous spike protein in
[53:53.600 --> 53:58.800]  the body that replicates it and then the shot does the exact same thing if you can jump
[53:58.800 --> 54:04.080]  back and forth and say oh people are sick he really took the shot from COVID when it's
[54:04.080 --> 54:12.120]  the shots causing the COVID here she is rising billionaires has been you know unprecedented
[54:12.120 --> 54:16.040]  during the pandemic and there's been several sectors where that has been mostly concentrated
[54:16.040 --> 54:20.880]  and one is in fact the pharma sector because COVID has been one of the most profitable
[54:20.880 --> 54:28.040]  products ever so that's one point to discuss in and our report out today is called profiting
[54:28.040 --> 54:36.360]  from pain how those delays in in making this technology available and really having people
[54:36.360 --> 54:41.960]  vaccinated early has contributed to that but has also as we said earlier it's not only
[54:41.960 --> 54:48.560]  the direct health impacts but it's the economic social impacts on all parts of the population
[54:48.560 --> 54:54.400]  and in reality an increase in inequality reversing the trend of the last few years where you
[54:54.400 --> 54:59.600]  know inequality had reduced between rich countries and poor countries unfortunately now it has
[54:59.600 --> 55:05.600]  widened and and the the statistic we're saying is every 30 hours a new billionaire was vintage
[55:05.600 --> 55:16.120]  during the pandemic all of that is lies 20 years ago a handful of people had half the
[55:16.120 --> 55:20.680]  wealth now they've got 80 plus percent the third world's never been poor the global
[55:20.680 --> 55:24.200]  disorder the lockdowns all their policies did this to the island of the world bank but
[55:24.200 --> 55:30.920]  she was honest about the fact that it is the most profitable thing ever for them meanwhile
[55:30.920 --> 55:36.160]  we've got this talk show host wearing a face mask and a face shield getting ready to do
[55:36.160 --> 55:41.920]  battle with unmasked unvaxxed COVID idiots on my flight to Charlotte to see my nine-year-old
[55:41.920 --> 55:48.440]  mom says Stephanie Miller of the talk show she got roasted by tens of thousands of responses
[55:48.440 --> 55:54.840]  you've had all the shots aren't you protected Dumbo oh it's not really a vaccine she has
[55:54.840 --> 56:00.320]  the Venn diagram the virtuous signalers I'm a good person the patronizing I'm more informed
[56:00.320 --> 56:07.640]  in intelligence the martyr I'm doing this for you not me and the middle you are here
[56:07.640 --> 56:12.440]  wearing a little symbol of slavery mask make a difference do your part to keep others safe
[56:12.440 --> 56:17.640]  wear your mask even though statistics show they do absolutely nothing to protect you
[56:17.640 --> 56:24.080]  and cause bacterial pneumonia it's like seeing a cardboard box is a bomb shelter to wear
[56:24.080 --> 56:31.200]  a mask parents protested for high school blocks of vaccine students from attending graduation
[56:31.200 --> 56:36.440]  you're in the wrong school former Goldman Sachs PhD never returning to normal it's the
[56:36.440 --> 56:42.720]  new world order they love their mask they love their lockdowns they love their slavery
[56:42.720 --> 56:48.840]  that's Joe Rogan doesn't love it though no listen Joe Rogan hello I'm Heather and I'm
[56:48.840 --> 56:52.840]  addicted to the COVID narrative at their little COVID fear meeting they all are wearing their
[56:52.840 --> 56:57.320]  mask and face shields getting in to the fear as governments have to compensate people all
[56:57.320 --> 57:02.640]  over the world because of the damages caused by it all right that's just some of what we're
[57:02.640 --> 57:10.520]  going to be getting into more later here today just remember the only way their conspiracy
[57:10.520 --> 57:14.920]  against humanity succeeds is if you don't spread the word if you don't share the articles
[57:14.920 --> 57:19.000]  if you don't share the videos on your email your text messages and systems that are harder
[57:19.000 --> 57:22.640]  for them to censor and if you don't get great products you already need at info or store

[59:07.120 --> 59:12.400]  demonized and lied about by the globalist owned and controlled press it's just come
[59:12.400 --> 59:18.000]  out as you know the NIH confirmed that they were ordered by Fauci and others in years past
[59:18.000 --> 59:23.560]  to send hundreds of millions of dollars to the Wuhan lab to create super weaponized viruses
[59:23.560 --> 59:28.640]  not just gain a function super weaponized viruses as you know that broke two days ago
[59:28.640 --> 59:34.520]  now and they've only given Fauci and Peter Dazik five days to hand over all the rest
[59:34.520 --> 59:39.600]  of the documents so this is the rats leaving the sinking ship this is evil being exposed
[59:39.600 --> 59:44.040]  and it's just the beginning just the size of it it's massive so keep spreading the word
[59:44.040 --> 59:49.560]  about info wars dot com and support these local stations they are so incredibly important
[59:49.560 --> 1:00:19.320]  they're saving america you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:19.320 --> 1:00:24.400]  today we're debating a gun control bill that's actually six gun control bills in one and
[1:00:24.400 --> 1:00:30.480]  why are there six because none of them work if you take six that don't work and put them
[1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:35.760]  together they're not going to work you can't make up for ineffective bills by having more
[1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:42.000]  than one or half a dozen of them each and every one of these gun control bills in this
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:49.400]  single title is unserious and unconstitutional and suffers from the the problem the inherent
[1:00:49.400 --> 1:00:54.880]  problem that almost all gun control suffers from and that is criminals do not obey the
[1:00:54.880 --> 1:01:01.320]  law they do not follow the law who who here today thinks that criminals are going to read
[1:01:01.320 --> 1:01:06.760]  the safe storage act and you know some gang member is going to say oh I better lock this
[1:01:06.760 --> 1:01:13.400]  gun up or else they'll come and take it who here today thinks that a 19 year old criminal
[1:01:13.400 --> 1:01:20.480]  is going to obey the the restriction on age for having a gun nobody here believes this
[1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:26.000]  these are unserious but they're worse than that they're going to compromise the rights
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:31.040]  and the safety of individual citizens law abiding citizens let me tell you the story
[1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:37.000]  of Nikki goes to her who's testified here in Congress and she worked for me in my congressional
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:42.400]  office Nikki watched her husband murdered get murdered in front of her viciously in
[1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:50.160]  a gun free zone while her licensed firearm was in her car outside of the restaurant
[1:01:50.160 --> 1:01:57.800]  she that haunts her today been in her had just recently been married and they just wanted
[1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:02.640]  to be in this restaurant and they followed the law and he was murdered by her stalker
[1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:08.200]  in front of her now she went on to get the laws changed in Tennessee to get rid of that
[1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:13.120]  gun free zone but that's one example just one example of how all the rest of these are
[1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:18.520]  going to fail the criminals do not follow the law and the biggest thing we could do that
[1:02:18.520 --> 1:02:25.640]  nobody on the other side of the aisle is talking about today is to quit advertising our schools
[1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:34.440]  as soft zones soft targets for defenseless teachers defenseless staff and students who
[1:02:34.440 --> 1:02:43.360]  aren't being defended Congress itself in 1990 passed the gun free school zone act it's
[1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:49.000]  done more it's cost more lives than it has saved now some states have been able to override
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.520]  the gun free school zone act and create their own areas and in those states in those school
[1:02:53.520 --> 1:02:58.000]  districts where that's happened where they've allowed qualified teachers and staff to carry
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:03.400]  there hasn't been a single mass shooting in one of those schools there hasn't been a single
[1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:10.360]  shooting of one person in one of those schools the biggest thing we could do here today is
[1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:16.720]  to repeal the 1990 gun free school school zone act so that the default condition in
[1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:24.200]  this country is not to advertise every student as a target now to mr. Sicilini's point he
[1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:29.520]  was talking about the supreme court you know in 1995 the the gun free school zone act was
[1:03:29.520 --> 1:03:40.320]  struck down why was that because this document does not contain the authority to implement
[1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:45.000]  a gun free school zone act so what did congress do they resuscitated this unconstitutional
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:49.960]  bill by putting in a provision that says well as long as the gun is involved in interstate
[1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:56.200]  commerce well then we have the authority well I wonder if that's the case with all six of
[1:03:56.200 --> 1:04:01.680]  these useless bills in here today because only two of the bills say that it's actually two
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:06.840]  of the bills say it only applies to firearms involved in interstate commerce does that
[1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:13.000]  mean the other four are unconstitutional or it actually means all six are unconstitutional
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:17.120]  and they're trying to save two of them with the provision that killed the gun free school
[1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:24.160]  zone act in 1995 by the way they they overturned mr. Lopez's conviction and he went on to serve
[1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:28.520]  in the Marines the one who was convicted of violating the gun free school zone act but
[1:04:28.520 --> 1:04:35.560]  congress came back and resuscitated it and unconstitutionally so but there there is
[1:04:35.560 --> 1:04:40.480]  a conflict between these six bills some of them recognize the constitutional flaw and
[1:04:40.480 --> 1:04:46.280]  some of them don't and I want to close with this some of my colleagues have said that the
[1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:53.720]  assault weapons ban from 1994 to 2004 reduced mass public shootings by 40% they make up

[1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:48.600]  talking about that topic the right to keep their arms has been taken almost everywhere
[1:07:48.600 --> 1:07:52.640]  in the world and the few countries like the u.s. and switzerland they're trying like to

[1:08:15.120 --> 1:08:20.480]  it all it says pay attention kids it's not science it's politics so when they say don't
[1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:26.120]  question science science is all about questioning anybody that says don't question its science
[1:08:26.120 --> 1:08:31.800]  is a cult leader and wants you to be in their cult i want you to question me i want you
[1:08:31.800 --> 1:08:37.240]  to do your own research oh but cnn's brian stelter and the new york times the rest of
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:43.520]  them say headlines don't ask questions don't do your own research the five deadly words
[1:08:43.520 --> 1:08:58.160]  do your own research think about it that's a cult 1960s oil is gone in 10 years that's
[1:08:58.160 --> 1:09:04.160]  a club of rome billard bird group 1970s another ice age is coming in 10 years 1980s acid rainbow
[1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:09.560]  destroy all crops in 10 years 1990s the ozone layer will be destroyed in 10 years 2000 the
[1:09:09.560 --> 1:09:15.560]  ice caps will melt in 10 years but the algores of the world all bought oceanfront property
[1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:23.240]  and it wasn't in arizona and if you can believe that i'm willing to sell you the brooklyn
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:30.600]  bridge i got some oceanfront property in arizona if you'll buy that i'll throw the golden gate
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:39.840]  in for free not happened but all resulted in more taxes more surveillance more control
[1:09:39.840 --> 1:09:48.120]  that certainly says it all you know i'm a subscriber to fox nation and took a corrosive
[1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:54.800]  show a lot of times i get home at night and uh my other children are all grown up moved
[1:09:54.800 --> 1:10:04.200]  out i'm an old man now son's almost 20 first daughter's 18 now a middle daughter decided
[1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:09.920]  to hear go go live with her mom that's fine it's where she lives lover to death got my
[1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:15.280]  five-year-old daughter i go home and we watched tucker carlson boy this is my five-year-old
[1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:20.400]  like her so is my wife so something we can all agree upon so i was watching this i said
[1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:24.000]  let me see if i can find a clip of this on twitter and i found it right away this is
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:30.960]  bread farf famous quarterback but more importantly a father and a patriot and what he says with
[1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:37.440]  common sense is so important and every adult tells their children this every smart adult
[1:10:37.440 --> 1:10:45.200]  does i know my parents told me this and it's enjoy your life now enjoy being young enjoy
[1:10:45.200 --> 1:10:50.840]  being old but enjoy where you're at enjoy the blue sky enjoy the moon enjoy the stars
[1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:55.120]  enjoy the beauty god gave you don't let the globalist get you down fight them because
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:10:59.680]  you love your family and love humanity don't fight them because you hate them and listen
[1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:05.720]  when i point my finger at you three more pointing back at me because i burned myself up with
[1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:13.320]  hate i did 80 percent of what i did for love but 20 percent was hate and boy they were
[1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:19.880]  viral clips and i looked like the devil when i was doing it and i meant the things i said
[1:11:19.880 --> 1:11:25.880]  but it's not sustainable love gives me more discernment love gives me more power love
[1:11:25.880 --> 1:11:33.640]  gives me more understanding and love in the moment and what god gave us is so important
[1:11:33.640 --> 1:11:38.400]  and what brett farf says is so true don't let the globalist grind you down don't make
[1:11:38.400 --> 1:11:43.280]  it a fight between you and them because you can't win you can't beat the devil but the
[1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:48.280]  god that made the universe and made us and gave us free will can and will beat the devil
[1:11:48.280 --> 1:11:54.840]  and so through god we will prevail but it is so central but brett farf says here here's
[1:11:54.840 --> 1:12:05.320]  the club not every god played that way or with that passion or i think when it was over
[1:12:05.320 --> 1:12:15.280]  for however many years it was how how how much or how little they didn't appreciate it yeah
[1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:20.840]  and i coached high school football for two years when i retired didn't make any money
[1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:26.600]  didn't want any money and enjoyed the hell out of it and i thought i was it was kind
[1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:32.240]  of a favorite to the head coach to be his offense coordinator but i it ended up being
[1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:38.560]  a blessing because i really enjoyed it but i would tell those kids all the time you gotta
[1:12:38.560 --> 1:12:42.560]  enjoy the moment i said first of all you're young when i was your age i couldn't wait
[1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:48.240]  to be twenty one or move on to the next level and while it's fortunate enough that i played
[1:12:48.240 --> 1:12:54.200]  long enough in afl that time sort of stopped if that makes sense yeah along the way with
[1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:59.800]  that i could kind of stop and smell the roses you know first seven five seven eight years
[1:12:59.800 --> 1:13:04.760]  man it was balls the wall just going blowing and going and next thing i know it's like
[1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:09.160]  it seemed like it took forever but before you knew it's it's like you know when you
[1:13:09.160 --> 1:13:13.480]  turn thirty the next birthday is fifty fifty three yeah and the next birthday was fifty
[1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:17.640]  three and like damn where'd all the twenty three years in between go just you know and
[1:13:17.640 --> 1:13:22.000]  i was fortunate enough that i played long enough that i could kind of stop and say you
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:30.400]  know enjoy this enjoy this moment no matter how fun or are disappointing it is enjoy this
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:35.680]  moment because there'll be a time when it too quickly it'll be gone and i saw so many
[1:13:35.680 --> 1:13:46.760]  guys not that it was here and gone just like them and never got to appreciate it and you
[1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:52.800]  know that sounds really simple but it's super deep and i've gotten to that point in my life
[1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:59.000]  at forty eight where i was always trying to beat the new world order i was always trying
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:02.920]  to stop what they were going to do i was always trying to think i could beat them i mean i
[1:14:02.920 --> 1:14:08.240]  believe in god and i got on my side but you know this is all going to play out this is
[1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:13.920]  all been foretold and we should all really freak out and realize man the bible is really
[1:14:13.920 --> 1:14:17.920]  being fulfilled and it doesn't matter your little church or your big church ain't going
[1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:22.160]  to tell you that because they're bought and paid for it the church doesn't live at that
[1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:28.720]  church house the church lives inside you as christ said inside your soul and so we got
[1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:33.320]  a lot of evil coming down on us but we got a lot of good as well and so that's the most
[1:14:33.320 --> 1:14:39.080]  important thing i can say anybody out there is gods in control folks and god has a plan
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:43.480]  for you and just don't let these people get you down and don't get so upset and feel like
[1:14:43.480 --> 1:14:48.440]  you're guilty because you can't beat them because man that's how i am and i can't survive
[1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:54.640]  doing that i'm so much stronger now that i just gave it to god like when i was sixteen
[1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:59.640]  or seventeen really fifteen fourteen years old i was a hellion my mom just prayed to
[1:14:59.640 --> 1:15:03.800]  god and said i give him i give him to you and it all turned out alright we got to give

[1:20:54.440 --> 1:21:00.200]  we're taking your calls right now on the declaration of war by the globalists
[1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:07.880]  to finally disarm the american people ladies and gentlemen i stepped out during the break of
[1:21:07.880 --> 1:21:12.680]  something on my car it's pouring down right out there it's pouring down tearing a little bit of
[1:21:12.680 --> 1:21:19.560]  a little water on me here we got Kathy we got sully we got joe we got kenan we got patriot we
[1:21:19.560 --> 1:21:28.120]  got url we got so many great people already on the line there's a lot of debates about the right
[1:21:28.120 --> 1:21:34.280]  to self-defense but it comes down to free will should we let airline pilots fly planes somebody
[1:21:34.280 --> 1:21:38.440]  might hijack it and fly it into a building should we let other people own guns because somebody bad
[1:21:38.440 --> 1:21:42.920]  might do something and on its face when you get a leftist to go out and shoot guns for the first
[1:21:42.920 --> 1:21:48.360]  time and they are shooting bull's eye out of 10 minutes they're like well why don't i get to have
[1:21:48.360 --> 1:21:54.680]  this what why you can have a chainsaw you can have a baseball bat you can have a car why can't you
[1:21:54.680 --> 1:22:03.960]  have this gun and it's because they wanted to harm you to enslave you and control you it's a very
[1:22:05.560 --> 1:22:11.480]  simple equation so what is your response to the puppet president that stole the election
[1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:19.800]  all proven by 2000 mules announcing their declaration of war against your right to self-defense
[1:22:19.800 --> 1:22:24.120]  while he's protected by the secret service and all these mayors that have defunded the police
[1:22:24.120 --> 1:22:29.160]  are protected by multi-million-dollar private security contracts what do you make of this what
[1:22:29.160 --> 1:22:33.800]  do you think we should do next let's talk to kathy in arizona kathy thanks for calling

[1:24:30.040 --> 1:24:31.080]  hi sully how you doing
[1:24:33.560 --> 1:24:39.400]  okay sully's gone uh let's go the next caller let's go to joe in kansas joe in kansas you're
[1:24:39.400 --> 1:24:45.880]  on the air go ahead hi alex it's an honor to speak with you today uh i'm calling because uh
[1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:55.800]  i'm a farmer in kansas and when covid started uh there was a local uh article in the goons about
[1:24:55.800 --> 1:25:02.360]  how they were going to take these cabins that my neighbor owns across the street from me and use them
[1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:09.320]  to confine people who were disobeying their quarantine orders that's right they're just
[1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:15.080]  introducing the idea of disappearing and locking people up and they're building giant camps all
[1:25:15.080 --> 1:25:20.680]  over the world isn't that incredible well i i approached it's incredible alex and i i did
[1:25:20.680 --> 1:25:25.160]  approach my neighbor about it and asked him he told me he never had any plans of the sort
[1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:31.320]  so i can only assume that they were going to appropriate his land and build a concentration
[1:25:31.320 --> 1:25:35.960]  camp across the street from my house brother that's how real it is and it's all directed
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:42.520]  by the un and bill gates all over the world including the us fema has built camps for 10
[1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:48.120]  million people they reported last year so they've got designated sites for 10 million people right now
[1:25:50.360 --> 1:25:57.000]  well i i personally a fan of most people in law enforcement i think most people in law enforcement
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:03.080]  are good but there are enough bad people there that they may try to do something i asked my local
[1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:09.720]  cop about it because he's a friend of mine i asked if if someone told you to enforce a quarantine
[1:26:09.720 --> 1:26:14.280]  order uh would you do it and he told me hell no he wouldn't and i believe most americans and that's
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:18.120]  why the left side war with the cops the cops aren't perfect i'm not perfect you're not perfect
[1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:23.000]  but overall compared to general public the police are amazing people and they get a lot of bad
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:27.240]  jurisdictions they have a lot of bad orders but on average cops are good people there's a lot of
[1:26:27.240 --> 1:26:32.200]  bad ones a lot of bad people period but absolutely that's why they're bullying the police i got an
[1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:37.720]  article right here where there's a video of the woman with a gun attacking the police with it
[1:26:39.080 --> 1:26:46.600]  and then they say oh uh cops shoot an unarmed black woman who's pregnant five times and there's
[1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:51.560]  video of her with a damn gun aiming at him and again i'm not glad a black woman or is dead or
[1:26:51.560 --> 1:26:57.800]  a white woman any be any woman the point is is that the media is at war with the infrastructure
[1:26:57.800 --> 1:27:02.520]  they don't control they control the top they don't control the bottom is the bottom perfect no but
[1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:06.840]  they want to demonize the bottom take a control of it and when they have control of the top of the
[1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:14.520]  bottom we are screwed well i think you're making us a little less crude brother and i appreciate

[1:33:01.880 --> 1:33:15.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:35.880]  i'd like to call to order this secret conclave of america's media empires we're here to come up with
[1:33:35.880 --> 1:33:40.680]  the next phony baloney crisis to put americans back where they belong and dark rooms glued to
[1:33:40.680 --> 1:33:45.480]  their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials well i think mbc you are here to
[1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:52.200]  listen and not speak i think we should go with a good old-fashioned public health care a new
[1:33:52.200 --> 1:33:57.160]  disease no one's immune it's like the summer of the shark except instead of a shark it's an epidemic
[1:33:57.160 --> 1:34:02.440]  and instead of summer it's all the time that is okay now i hate to be the guy who derails
[1:34:02.440 --> 1:34:08.760]  with everybody else loves loves being that guy but janice we do have standards this can't be a
[1:34:08.760 --> 1:34:14.600]  made-up disease the only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public
[1:34:14.600 --> 1:34:19.320]  we do have something we've been holding on to but it hasn't been tested get over here in bc
[1:34:21.480 --> 1:34:31.880]  well we certainly believe in testing but i oh wow wow oh yeah so we've got our deadly disease
[1:34:31.880 --> 1:34:37.720]  now we just have to blame it on something that's in every household something that people are a
[1:34:37.720 --> 1:34:43.160]  little bit afraid of already house cat flu is coming people the center for disease disinformation
[1:34:43.160 --> 1:34:47.720]  predicts with some degree of probability that the house cat flu might spread in the following
[1:34:47.720 --> 1:34:54.520]  hypothetical outbreak pattern so better be aware that warm body on your lap just might be ready to
[1:34:54.520 --> 1:35:05.640]  destroy your tender vitals springfielders are advised to stay tuned for more information if
[1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:10.840]  they experience any of the following symptoms mild thirst occasional hunger tiredness at night
[1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:19.880]  that's from 15 years ago and now it all came true in your face making a joke out of it we're
[1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:24.120]  taking calls the order they're received cannon in texas you're on the air welcome cannon
[1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:30.840]  hello general jones i got two important uh features i want to point out number one is
[1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:36.520]  the joe biden that you see right now on tv is not the real joe biden people's facial
[1:35:36.520 --> 1:35:42.360]  features do not change and if you look at the ear lobe the right ear lobe of the real biden that
[1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:47.320]  was in office when he was with obama you can see that his right ear lobe is heavily rounded
[1:35:47.960 --> 1:35:53.560]  and if you look at the fake biden his ear lobe is straight there's no roundedness to the bottom
[1:35:53.560 --> 1:35:58.840]  of his ear lobe and once you start looking at the difference in the two bidens the fake biden
[1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:05.480]  versus the real biden you'll see that the real biden has a much taller larger forehead so they've
[1:36:05.480 --> 1:36:10.200]  obviously not just got a puppet in there but they don't even have the real biden in there i think the
[1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:16.680]  real biden somewhere with fc on a new island somewhere the second topic is microsoft keeps
[1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:23.080]  updating my windows 10 even though that operating system is well over a decade old and there's no
[1:36:23.080 --> 1:36:29.560]  reason for any updates to be doing i've turned off my computer where i told it that i don't want
[1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:37.080]  updates to even be occurring and i'm talking about two or three four updates a month by bill gaith's
[1:36:37.800 --> 1:36:43.400]  uh computer business and he's still running the show over there even though he says he stepped
[1:36:43.400 --> 1:36:48.680]  down bill gaith is still the lead man at microsoft and for some reason my operating system keeps
[1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:53.560]  updating are you guys having the same issue well they're all spying on us it's all sorts of craziness
[1:36:54.360 --> 1:36:59.560]  kidding i don't know i mean all i know is biden's a puppet anyway he's slicing and he is a shriveled
[1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:04.120]  version of his previous self so who the hell knows like but i mean anything can be because
[1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:09.240]  they lied to us so much let's talk to patriot in ohio patriot you're on the air go ahead
[1:37:09.880 --> 1:37:15.240]  how you doing today man it's good to see you um i've got a question for you um very rarely do i
[1:37:15.240 --> 1:37:20.840]  hear anything about our sheriff's department doing anything about what's going on i feel like they're
[1:37:20.840 --> 1:37:26.920]  our last line of defense in which they are to uphold the constitution i've called alexandria
[1:37:26.920 --> 1:37:30.920]  sheriff's department left them messages tried to get ahold of them they're not getting ahold of me
[1:37:30.920 --> 1:37:36.840]  back um i don't know but i feel like if everybody would talk to their sheriffs and get them together
[1:37:36.840 --> 1:37:41.960]  that might help the situation i totally agree we should wait raise awareness of the sheriff being
[1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:47.000]  the oldest institution since the magna carta predating that and the most important elected
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:52.280]  official in any county who is there to enforce the constitution and bill of rights and state and
[1:37:52.280 --> 1:37:57.400]  local law and they have incredible power and we need to empower our sheriffs to be guardians of
[1:37:57.400 --> 1:38:03.000]  the republic i totally agree with you yeah i don't i really don't get it do you have a reason
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:07.640]  or any reason why they're not arresting these people like are all these politicians immune
[1:38:07.640 --> 1:38:11.480]  from getting well and they control the justice department so how do you get a state grand jury to
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:16.360]  do and die people the question is how bad is it gonna get as the ruling class knows there's nobody
[1:38:16.360 --> 1:38:24.520]  enforcing they can insider trade child smuggle open borders devalue currencies anything they want
[1:38:24.520 --> 1:38:29.240]  the question is how bad will it get we've i mean we've reached that point yeah oh i totally agree
[1:38:29.240 --> 1:38:34.520]  with you um i had another question for you you're you're always talking about needing money uh to
[1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:40.360]  keep keep info wars on air how about if you guys put like all the information you've ever had on
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:46.360]  what's going on until like zip drives and sell them i mean i'd buy it that's a great idea download
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:51.880]  the websites and put all our main films on a zip drive and and sell an info wars archive we've heard
[1:38:51.880 --> 1:38:56.440]  that before that's something we should look at doing and doing god bless you great idea all
[1:38:56.440 --> 1:39:00.760]  right let's go ahead and take another caller let's talk to erin in wisconsin erin welcome
[1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:07.480]  hey jones how you doing i just want to make a couple couple points quick i've been listening to you
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:13.400]  for about 15 years though i never found you at info wars it was always on youtube and uh just
[1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:18.760]  kind of to the point your point of discernments i always kind of had this discernment that what
[1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:23.000]  you were saying was the truth or at least put me on the on the path to the truth i could just
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:27.240]  kind of feel it i didn't really know it but now i've been listening to you so hold on i'm not
[1:39:27.240 --> 1:39:31.640]  going to interrupt you long but let me just say this what you said is the perfect description
[1:39:32.280 --> 1:39:38.360]  i am not the truth i try to tell the truth i am in i am i'm fouled i'm a sinner i'm a human but
[1:39:38.360 --> 1:39:42.760]  i'm trying to tell the truth but we're very good at getting people on the path to truth
[1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:48.200]  and to god that's a perfect way info wars is not the truth it helps get people on the path to
[1:39:48.200 --> 1:39:53.960]  truth this truth is a journey go ahead exactly and you have put me on the path to god and i've
[1:39:53.960 --> 1:39:59.800]  and i found god uh and i really credit you largely for that i've always had my my struggles uh you
[1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:05.480]  know with the idea of god but uh you know honestly it's you and others like you who have shown me
[1:40:05.480 --> 1:40:10.680]  the other side of that coin the evil you know that shows me that you know the good side god
[1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:17.720]  really does exist and again i just i can feel it now and uh you know another point that i
[1:40:17.720 --> 1:40:25.000]  wanted to make is with the second amendment being under attack and just people like me and you
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:31.160]  trump supporters uh the right whatever you want to whatever you want to call us uh i feel like
[1:40:31.160 --> 1:40:37.160]  our leaders in congress or just public figures don't really make the point enough that even if
[1:40:37.160 --> 1:40:42.760]  it were true that donald trump and all of us you know supporters and republicans on the right
[1:40:42.760 --> 1:40:49.160]  right even if we were these nasty racists and and all of this even if it were true it's people
[1:40:49.160 --> 1:40:54.840]  like you and like me who are the watchdogs who need the second amendment who would never allow
[1:40:54.840 --> 1:41:01.400]  people uh like that tyrants to take hold and to round up you know the lgbt community or black
[1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:06.360]  people or asian people or whoever they want to parade out oh it's outrageous lies the democrats
[1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:13.480]  are running ads that senator rand paul that's anti-war it's going to lynch black people i mean i mean
[1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:19.400]  it's it's like saying i'm going to blow the moon up tomorrow what they're doing is savage evil
[1:41:20.120 --> 1:41:26.440]  fraud lies division right and it doesn't take much to expose i mean there's like that video of
[1:41:26.440 --> 1:41:31.000]  rand paul and his wife walking uh you know i think it was after the republican national convention
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:35.560]  2020 when all this riots were going on and these people were you know following him and and there
[1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:40.200]  was a police officer who stuck with him who i think took a punch to the face and they these people
[1:41:40.200 --> 1:41:45.240]  don't even realize that he's the one who is introducing legislation to get rid of these
[1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:50.760]  no knock wall they kept saying say her name when he got the bill passed in that woman's name
[1:41:52.440 --> 1:41:56.120]  the the black lady that got killed the black it's insane it's like
[1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:04.440]  it's just crazy it's it's absolutely crazy it's like coming to michael jordan saying say michael
[1:42:04.440 --> 1:42:09.160]  jordan's name why are you against michael jordan and you're michael jordan great point thank you so
[1:42:09.160 --> 1:42:19.000]  much all right i'm ed and mike and so many others your calls are coming up on the other side of this
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:25.400]  break but speaking to support all i'm asking listeners to do is follow your heart and think
[1:42:25.400 --> 1:42:30.680]  about what do you want to support where is there a place for you to know that you're supporting by
[1:42:30.680 --> 1:42:35.400]  word of mouth by prayer by buying products that you know is having a big effect and info wars is
[1:42:35.400 --> 1:42:40.840]  really the best place and we're embattled and we're on the front line so infowarstore.com

[1:42:54.520 --> 1:43:05.320]  the globalist social engineers always intended to push their covid biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[1:43:05.320 --> 1:43:12.200]  until the populations rebelled they would then use that as a pretext for permanent martial law
[1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:18.280]  and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their locks but because of so many
[1:43:18.280 --> 1:43:23.240]  scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and and whistleblowers
[1:43:23.240 --> 1:43:30.680]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government
[1:43:30.680 --> 1:43:36.520]  corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever the problem is some
[1:43:36.520 --> 1:43:41.880]  globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover like canada so they've now
[1:43:41.880 --> 1:43:47.800]  declared a civil emergency and martial law in ontario and other areas of the world are following

[1:48:06.440 --> 1:48:11.320]  the pressure on us so us as masses we need to really come together before i don't even know
[1:48:11.320 --> 1:48:16.040]  no i agree that they're dividing and conquering us while hillary that has all these armed bodyguards
[1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:20.520]  says no one actually needs an hour 15 well maybe the folks have been gods they needed people they
[1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:25.720]  are 15 to protect them hillary and then the mass shooting uh the mass shooting that happened in
[1:48:25.720 --> 1:48:30.760]  texas my condolences to the family but they did a whole there's the digital soldiers around the
[1:48:30.760 --> 1:48:39.160]  world we we actually put a video of google maps here's a mason uh symbol anybody can go google
[1:48:39.160 --> 1:48:47.400]  map this the only angle of the shooter going inside the school the only angle of the shooter
[1:48:47.400 --> 1:48:52.200]  going inside the school they put on google maps and you literally see in front of it there's
[1:48:52.200 --> 1:48:56.440]  like a a garden piece where they're hanging on the tree on the left hand side anybody can go

[1:49:06.440 --> 1:49:10.840]  the world that are part of mason's but they've been infiltrated by a lot of bad people bad people
[1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:15.480]  that have killed good people like jerry gallatin which was the king of barter and trade that was
[1:49:15.480 --> 1:49:21.560]  given that that was by new york magazine new york times this is back in the 80s and 90s my grandfather
[1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:27.560]  was the king of barter they killed them because he was taken out by the irs by taxes he was allowing
[1:49:27.560 --> 1:49:33.960]  people to have a free economic and free powerful capitalistic future without the irs with their
[1:49:33.960 --> 1:49:38.600]  crooks i'm sorry they're crooks i still have to hear you i will look into that thank you so much

[1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:44.440]  more than that now mike and they've changed their story at least 19 times and so i don't know what
[1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:49.640]  really happened there but man there's a cover-up going on brother you got that right brother and
[1:50:49.640 --> 1:50:54.760]  i'm treated like a second-class citizen i was dead i had two heart attacks in four days before
[1:50:54.760 --> 1:51:00.600]  but all this i'm forced on security of the mechanical cab driver i make a long story short

[1:51:24.200 --> 1:51:31.000]  mark in kentucky you're on the air go ahead hey alex mark in loyville honor to talk to you my question
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:37.480]  is about abortion and what they're doing with the uh the the fetuses and the and the body parts
[1:51:38.760 --> 1:51:43.240]  do you believe that they're creating a uh i guess a treatment for the world elites with them
[1:51:43.880 --> 1:51:48.040]  well i don't think i don't think that they're using it for live extension technologies they're
[1:51:48.040 --> 1:51:54.040]  sucking their juices out of sanguating them to create treatments uh 100 percent they're just
[1:51:54.040 --> 1:51:59.960]  teaching us that humans are a commodity yeah i guess because i looked at when you know hillary
[1:51:59.960 --> 1:52:06.680]  collapsed at the 9 11 ceremony and that they rushed her to chelsea's apartment instead of a
[1:52:06.680 --> 1:52:11.800]  hospital i just wondered what treatment was available at her apartment that wasn't available to hospital
[1:52:12.520 --> 1:52:17.080]  well they do get private treatments and they do get the blood of children that's mainline news
[1:52:17.080 --> 1:52:22.920]  there's major companies to do it yeah okay i appreciate your input thank you alex anything
[1:52:22.920 --> 1:52:28.120]  else any other questions those are great questions not now keep on keep it on brother well it's like
[1:52:28.120 --> 1:52:32.520]  in soylent green the science fiction movie from the early 70s soylent greens man of people we're
[1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:39.720]  turning ourselves into a commodity george in canada george welcome what's going on buddy
[1:52:40.440 --> 1:52:43.640]  well first year dictator announces gun confiscation now ours does
[1:52:43.640 --> 1:52:51.240]  well listen man i just want to say something reset wars i find you don't push it enough

[1:52:58.280 --> 1:53:02.680]  all about how they control you and transcending we love recent wars recent wars dot com
[1:53:03.560 --> 1:53:09.640]  want to thank all the folks that got the course um next off okay the big thing i want to talk to
[1:53:09.640 --> 1:53:15.640]  you about is uh we got nato right with the world economic forum the globalist pushing russia to
[1:53:15.640 --> 1:53:21.240]  war and we got the chinese that are aligned with him now we know that the ideology that the world
[1:53:21.240 --> 1:53:27.480]  economic forum is pushing is communist right it's a form of communist but we have china and russia
[1:53:28.120 --> 1:53:32.920]  that are pushing somewhat of a similar ideology i mean at the end of all of this man it's
[1:53:32.920 --> 1:53:38.840]  communism that comes in we don't win right like it comes down to us people having to take our
[1:53:38.840 --> 1:53:44.680]  government back because it's it's communism either way we see it man well it's communism
[1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:50.440]  integrated with the high tech world social credit score carbon tax vaccine passport but yes
[1:53:50.440 --> 1:53:55.160]  it's communal systems which humans are designed to do in small tribes but not a big central
[1:53:55.160 --> 1:54:01.320]  government running and they want that for social control and dehumanization yeah but i mean like
[1:54:01.320 --> 1:54:07.480]  if this war does end up happening if either side wins i mean us the people are taking on communism
[1:54:07.480 --> 1:54:15.880]  you know you know like it for me like i guess like my question is this what are your thoughts on that
[1:54:15.880 --> 1:54:21.720]  like do we do we end up having to take it take it back at some point or do we have to accept either
[1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:28.120]  side well only god understands the total future the devil pretends to and it's our job is to tell
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:32.440]  the truth and be strong and give the rest of it to god and so this is all a giant test that's what
[1:54:32.440 --> 1:54:37.880]  we know brother yeah well it's just like i find everybody like i'm not trying to say that everybody's
[1:54:37.880 --> 1:54:43.400]  playing it off like russia's putting a a thwart on the world economics plan the world economics
[1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:48.760]  forums plans but i mean it's the only type of somewhat communism that allows christianity i mean
[1:54:48.760 --> 1:54:55.000]  that this is an attack on christianity because thank you so much for the call don in texas go
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:55:03.640]  ahead you're on the air so um alex yes sir so this is about the one world government that is
[1:55:03.640 --> 1:55:08.600]  obviously being proposed it's nothing new it's in the bible it's mentioned two twice in the bible
[1:55:08.600 --> 1:55:13.800]  babelon in the old testament which was the tower of babel i'm sure you know this and god knocked
[1:55:13.800 --> 1:55:19.880]  it down so we don't know exactly what's going on there but it got knocked down now the second world
[1:55:19.880 --> 1:55:25.880]  one government called the whore of babelon a lot of people mistake it for it being america but that's
[1:55:25.880 --> 1:55:33.960]  actually not true the uh the whore of babelon is when all the nations lose their sovereignty and
[1:55:33.960 --> 1:55:39.880]  that is the one world government when god's protection is removed and that's exactly what
[1:55:39.880 --> 1:55:46.920]  is happening now like you said we don't know what's going to happen but nothing new well there's no
[1:55:46.920 --> 1:55:51.880]  doubt we have a satanic world government that is following everything the bible said what happened
[1:55:51.880 --> 1:55:56.680]  so you can deny it all day long people can say it's not happening uh but it is the question is
[1:55:56.680 --> 1:56:01.000]  what are we going to do well we realize we have an eternal soul so the main thing is a relationship
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:06.040]  with god to prove that no matter how bad it gets we're going to stay being good people it's a test
[1:56:06.040 --> 1:56:08.520]  we're not even supposed to be able to fix this brother we're going to go through this
[1:56:10.040 --> 1:56:15.640]  exactly appreciate you alex do you mind if i ask you a question i'm glad okay so there's a
[1:56:15.640 --> 1:56:21.080]  joe rogan video it's called the stay behind network of a hitler finding a hitler and uh
[1:56:21.080 --> 1:56:25.400]  basically the reason few are so corrupt is they think they're entitled through like a bloodline
[1:56:25.400 --> 1:56:31.080]  obviously they're deceived by saying just like hitler was and how and you know in that video
[1:56:31.080 --> 1:56:36.120]  talks about you know they didn't really find hitler all the stay behind elites went to southern
[1:56:36.120 --> 1:56:40.200]  america and they're all there i mean do you think and those people are entitled to bloodline i mean
[1:56:40.200 --> 1:56:44.200]  you talked about people who are not specific it's people and we're adopted through jesus christ
[1:56:44.200 --> 1:56:49.640]  who know christians are not like that we know we are adopted but how how much of that do you think
[1:56:49.640 --> 1:56:53.480]  is true do you think there are the stay behind networks of people with that mindset because
[1:56:53.480 --> 1:56:58.520]  they all have that same access like oh there's no doubt that the globalists the merovingian line
[1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:02.680]  all that believe that they are chosen their elites and they're supposed to take them to
[1:57:02.680 --> 1:57:07.400]  dominion of the earth get rid of us the useless eaters and that because of their genetics which
[1:57:07.400 --> 1:57:12.760]  are psychopathic they have a right to rule and so what you what you're saying is absolutely central
[1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:18.120]  and i appreciate your call all right i already heard this report yesterday but it's so powerful
[1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:22.680]  i'm going to air it again when we come back then our special guest joins us and then after she's
[1:57:22.680 --> 1:57:27.000]  gone if you everybody wants to hold we got a lot of calls around the board i got to a lot of calls
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:32.040]  but there's a lot of left we'll get to you as well i don't want to air this report the true evil
[1:57:32.040 --> 1:57:37.080]  behind america's mass shootings this is just unbelievably powerful that's coming up next
[1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:43.160]  segment and then our special guest former prompt impeachment lawyer and talk show host we'll be
[1:57:43.160 --> 1:57:50.920]  joining us hour number three straight ahead the internet and talk radio are on fire with the
[1:57:50.920 --> 1:57:55.800]  slogan alec jones was right people ask what's it like to be vindicated well it's actually very
[1:57:55.800 --> 1:58:02.680]  sick feeling because i knew this was coming i tried to stop it and now everything i've talked about
[1:58:02.680 --> 1:58:07.960]  is going to become more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding it anymore

[1:59:53.240 --> 2:00:16.040]  jones show
[2:00:16.040 --> 2:00:23.480]  perhaps the most evil display of deception and murder we are subjected to today are found
[2:00:23.480 --> 2:00:31.320]  in the new phenomenon of mass school shootings prior to 1999 they were practically non-existent
[2:00:31.320 --> 2:00:36.840]  but today they have almost become predictable and if you are able to examine the evidence
[2:00:36.840 --> 2:00:44.840]  objectively without getting emotional a pattern can be recognized former naval intelligence officer
[2:00:44.840 --> 2:00:53.480]  turned whistleblower milton william cooper wrote in his book behold a pale horse published in 1991
[2:00:53.480 --> 2:01:00.520]  that the cia was using drugs and hypnosis on mental patients in order to persuade them to open fire
[2:01:00.520 --> 2:01:08.120]  on schoolyards to inflame the anti-gun lobby and do away with the second amendment this probably
[2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:15.160]  sounds outlandishly evil and it is but the evidence is there in the columbine shootings
[2:01:15.160 --> 2:01:23.480]  of 1999 we are told that eric harris and dylan cliball acted alone the town of columbine colorado
[2:01:23.480 --> 2:01:31.240]  was created in 1958 for families and employees of the military industrial complex eric and
[2:01:31.240 --> 2:01:36.760]  dylan were arrested a year prior to the shooting and were allegedly sodomized by the arresting
[2:01:36.760 --> 2:01:43.720]  officer which may sound crazy but a local officer admitted to raping informants which is a known
[2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:51.240]  method of trauma-based mind control after this january incident eric and dylan were put into a
[2:01:51.240 --> 2:01:59.720]  juvenile diversion program and prescribed ssri drugs known to cause homicidal ideation during
[2:01:59.720 --> 2:02:05.960]  this time eric harris was making online death threats and bomb threats local police were
[2:02:05.960 --> 2:02:12.840]  aware of this and drafted a search warrant affidavit but it was ignored eric and dylan threatened
[2:02:12.840 --> 2:02:19.320]  revenge for the january incident in their yearbook they produced a school video about their plans
[2:02:19.880 --> 2:02:26.040]  and began openly collecting weapons all of this while on probation and nothing was done about it
[2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:31.640]  during the shootings the police stood outside the building and did nothing while the sounds of
[2:02:31.640 --> 2:02:38.520]  automatic gunfire and explosions continued for hours in official transcripts there are over
[2:02:38.520 --> 2:02:45.000]  100 witnesses who saw more than two shooters and more than 40 witnesses who identified the same
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:51.080]  two men in their 30s one balding and the other with a short military style haircut several
[2:02:51.080 --> 2:02:57.800]  witnesses described the same adult male throwing a pipe bomb on the roof of the library all of them
[2:02:57.800 --> 2:03:05.240]  certain that it wasn't dylan or eric and all of this information pertaining to additional shooters
[2:03:05.240 --> 2:03:12.600]  has been redacted the fbi agent in charge of the columbine investigation had a son who recently
[2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:19.160]  attended the school who shot a student film inside columbine high two years before the shooting
[2:03:19.160 --> 2:03:25.560]  about a character wearing a trench coat shooting up the school dylan and eric fantasized about
[2:03:25.560 --> 2:03:34.200]  hijacking an airplane and crashing it into a new york city skyscraper in 1999 are these just strange
[2:03:34.200 --> 2:03:41.960]  coincidences or remnants of the fed's mk ultra program an honest investigation into any of the
[2:03:41.960 --> 2:03:49.160]  mass school shootings following columbine will have the same signatures such as families involved
[2:03:49.160 --> 2:03:56.600]  in the military industrial complex prescribed ssri's and other psychotropic drugs psychological
[2:03:56.600 --> 2:04:03.160]  care provided by the state and associations with law enforcement prior to the shootings just like
[2:04:03.160 --> 2:04:09.240]  we saw with the retired federal agent in regular communication with the buffalo gunman in a private
[2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:15.720]  discord chat room and in the recent texas school shooting how is the perpetrator able to afford
[2:04:15.720 --> 2:04:24.040]  nearly $5,000 of weaponry and why did the police stand down while children were slaughtered we are
[2:04:24.040 --> 2:04:31.080]  still allowed to question these things but for how long this evil will never stop until the truth
[2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:37.160]  is exposed and unfortunately most of us are too emotional to see things as they really are

[2:06:09.400 --> 2:06:22.280]  broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones well i could not think of a better guess to get on with
[2:06:22.280 --> 2:06:28.600]  what's currently happening jenna ellis is a constitutional lawyer attorney and serve as
[2:06:28.600 --> 2:06:34.600]  senior legal advisor to president trump on his campaign and so much more and she was the chair
[2:06:34.600 --> 2:06:39.400]  woman of the election integrity alliance special counsel for thomas more society and newsmax
[2:06:39.400 --> 2:06:44.840]  contributor she's also an author of legal basis for the moral constitution and she joins us now
[2:06:44.840 --> 2:06:53.160]  the jenna ellis show dot com at jenna ellis esq on all social platforms so much to talk about
[2:06:54.120 --> 2:07:00.200]  with the midterms 158 days with the russia gate thing being proven to be a hoax hell we knew that
[2:07:00.200 --> 2:07:04.440]  ourselves because they blame me for being a russian agent i have no connection to russians uh the
[2:07:04.440 --> 2:07:10.920]  attack on free speech the whole lgbtp attack on children the big supreme court decisions coming
[2:07:10.920 --> 2:07:15.640]  up biden attacking the second amendment so much more so jenna ellis thank you so much for coming
[2:07:15.640 --> 2:07:19.880]  on with this great to see you here feel like i know you watch you so much on television and
[2:07:19.880 --> 2:07:26.520]  watch your show where do you want to start now at this friday june third broadcast yeah well thank
[2:07:26.520 --> 2:07:30.760]  you so much alex for having me on and i'm a huge fan of yours as well and uh we have to stay
[2:07:30.760 --> 2:07:35.800]  together to be truth tellers and i think that's where we have to start is fundamentally the truth
[2:07:35.800 --> 2:07:41.640]  because all of these things have one thing in common that the government and the democrats can
[2:07:41.640 --> 2:07:47.960]  continue to try to infringe upon our constitutionally protected rights when joe biden said last night
[2:07:47.960 --> 2:07:53.720]  that the constitution and the second amendment is not absolute he has no idea what he's talking
[2:07:53.720 --> 2:07:59.240]  about because even if we repealed the second amendment today well guess what god himself
[2:07:59.240 --> 2:08:04.520]  gave us the right to self-defense and the right to keep in their arms and our declaration and
[2:08:04.520 --> 2:08:08.920]  our government recognizes that those rights come from god our creator not our government
[2:08:08.920 --> 2:08:14.520]  and so it would be meaningless but the but the democrats continue to try to push their leftist
[2:08:14.520 --> 2:08:20.920]  marxist agenda and we have to continue to stand firm and speak truth how would you describe the
[2:08:20.920 --> 2:08:25.720]  democratic party right now they seem desperate all the polls are historically against them i mean
[2:08:25.720 --> 2:08:29.800]  how would you describe their position right now because i see it as desperate which makes me more
[2:08:29.800 --> 2:08:38.440]  dangerous i think desperate but also uh confident in a very dangerous way because we have seen through
[2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:43.800]  the 2020 election we've seen what they are trying to accomplish through the world economic forum
[2:08:43.800 --> 2:08:48.440]  and so many other ways that they don't care about the voters in america they think they are entitled
[2:08:48.440 --> 2:08:52.760]  to power power and so i don't think they care what the poll show i don't think they care
[2:08:52.760 --> 2:08:58.360]  what the voters are saying they don't care what the evidence shows they just want to continue
[2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:03.400]  to win at any cost because they believe that they're entitled to power and that's what makes them
[2:09:03.400 --> 2:09:09.960]  dangerous well that does make them dangerous because they hid biden on the campaign trials
[2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:15.080]  and they're about to steal the election and and now they don't care how low the polls go the
[2:09:15.080 --> 2:09:20.280]  what is their what is their ace card up the sleeve is it another 2 000 mules or what do you think
[2:09:22.760 --> 2:09:28.520]  yeah i think that they're gonna definitely run on this whole uh abortion issue and dob's being
[2:09:28.520 --> 2:09:33.960]  overturned and also the second amendment and gun control but that has failed for them in the past
[2:09:33.960 --> 2:09:38.760]  in the sense that we're all seeing through this now my generation in gen z is the most pro-life
[2:09:38.760 --> 2:09:43.800]  generation because we understand the truth that abortion is a medical intervention that specifically
[2:09:43.800 --> 2:09:48.200]  designed to cause the death of a child we know and we're seeing from ultrasounds i mean follow the
[2:09:48.200 --> 2:09:52.520]  science right follow the science that shows that life begins at conception so that's going to fail
[2:09:52.520 --> 2:09:56.920]  for them gun control is going to fail for them because we thankfully now through the course
[2:09:56.920 --> 2:10:02.680]  of the covid pandemic have seen how the petty tyrants can very quickly arbitrarily and easily
[2:10:02.680 --> 2:10:08.200]  take away our rights so incredibly quickly that we are not as a country going to be disarmed we
[2:10:08.200 --> 2:10:12.440]  are not as a country going to just trust the health advisors we're not going to trust the
[2:10:12.440 --> 2:10:17.640]  government so the only thing that they have left is to cheat and interestingly yesterday
[2:10:17.640 --> 2:10:24.440]  a mule from arizona actually pled guilty and this is showing that even more indictments are coming
[2:10:24.440 --> 2:10:28.040]  and while the leftists are just saying well this was only a couple of ballots it's not outcome
[2:10:28.040 --> 2:10:33.320]  determinative it's not widespread proof the question we need to ask is how many more were there
[2:10:33.320 --> 2:10:38.920]  and why don't you care everyone has to care about election integrity well we have all the
[2:10:38.920 --> 2:10:43.400]  compilations of democrats talking about election fraud now the machines don't work and all the
[2:10:43.400 --> 2:10:47.720]  rest of before but as soon as this happens to trump oh now it doesn't exist you're not supposed to
[2:10:47.720 --> 2:10:52.200]  question it but we also would have this new homeland security report out saying that the
[2:10:52.200 --> 2:11:00.280]  dominion machines in 17 states have major holes in them yeah and you know what's fascinating to
[2:11:00.280 --> 2:11:06.360]  me about this is we had a report in texas from i believe it was around 2016 2018 so well before
[2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:12.440]  the 2020 election that questioned the security measures of these machines and so the fact that
[2:11:12.440 --> 2:11:19.640]  texas didn't allow implementation by their attorney general report now if we even ask questions about
[2:11:19.640 --> 2:11:23.560]  the machines we ask questions about the ballots we ask questions about the outcome of the election
[2:11:23.560 --> 2:11:27.560]  well you're an insurrectionist you know you are a trader you are a fraudster i mean they're trying
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:32.760]  to take away my bar license as a lawyer simply because i was willing to advocate for president
[2:11:32.760 --> 2:11:38.120]  trump and to put forward my client's claims and to say we are willing to ask questions
[2:11:38.120 --> 2:11:43.640]  and so the fact that the left is trying so hard to suppress the truth of what happened in 2020
[2:11:43.640 --> 2:11:49.240]  and the truth of the danger of all of these lack of security measures across the country
[2:11:49.240 --> 2:11:54.440]  just shows that they have something to hide i would imagine you've seen 2000 mules but
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:58.360]  for me it's extremely compelling evidence of how they did it
[2:11:58.360 --> 2:12:04.920]  absolutely and i was actually there in marilago with my good friend dinesh desusa and president
[2:12:04.920 --> 2:12:09.880]  trump and rudy juliani and others for the premiere of this movie and you know it was
[2:12:09.880 --> 2:12:15.560]  to me it just showed what we knew all along that this was a coordinated effort and that you saw
[2:12:15.560 --> 2:12:20.920]  all of these people who were caught on video based on this geotracking there's no other
[2:12:20.920 --> 2:12:27.560]  reasonable explanation why someone at 2 and 4 a.m would be going to 24 or multiple different
[2:12:27.560 --> 2:12:32.440]  ballot drop boxes in the middle of the night and that their geotracking location showed them there
[2:12:32.440 --> 2:12:36.600]  so then you go and you get the video and the left keeps saying well you know there weren't
[2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:40.920]  some video on some things and how come you know you blurt out this has been a debunked myth well
[2:12:40.920 --> 2:12:47.160]  they're they are never ever willing to focus on any of the facts any of the evidence you know
[2:12:47.160 --> 2:12:53.480]  that i submitted over 9 000 pages of documents to the january 6th committee do you know how many
[2:12:53.480 --> 2:12:59.560]  reporters asked me about the substance of those documents that we had during the 2020 election
[2:12:59.560 --> 2:13:04.040]  absolutely zero oh that's the thing that's the thing the truth doesn't matter to them
[2:13:04.600 --> 2:13:09.480]  they just act like they talk to you or myself so they can then make up what we supposedly said to
[2:13:09.480 --> 2:13:14.040]  them like they said i called the committee and i was and i called the fbi and i was going to come
[2:13:14.040 --> 2:13:18.920]  in expose trump and it was just all completely made up in hundreds of newspapers and i had thousands
[2:13:18.920 --> 2:13:23.400]  of thousands of calls and emails saying why are you selling trump out i never talked to trump during
[2:13:23.400 --> 2:13:28.440]  the election we he didn't send me to the capital attack people but they just lied in the news and
[2:13:28.440 --> 2:13:34.600]  said that i was uh going to come in and expose everything all a giant fraud just like russia
[2:13:34.600 --> 2:13:40.200]  gate just like that's a fraud they're russia gate but then hunter biden how they censored that how
[2:13:40.200 --> 2:13:46.120]  they covered the laptop and said that didn't exist yeah and that's all that they have are these lies
[2:13:46.120 --> 2:13:51.960]  and they have the mainstream media that is the fourth estate and they have the the mainstream
[2:13:51.960 --> 2:13:57.400]  media that is willing to lie for them and to paint this false narrative and so we don't even ever have
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:02.680]  a chance other than on broadcast like yours and all of these other platforms that are not legacy
[2:14:02.680 --> 2:14:07.560]  media that's where we can truly get out the truth and i think that's why your show is so successful
[2:14:07.560 --> 2:14:11.880]  because people are recognizing that they can't trust the mainstream media telling them what to
[2:14:11.880 --> 2:14:16.360]  believe and that they are hiding things from them and so they want to hear the truth and they're having
[2:14:16.360 --> 2:14:21.000]  to go to alternative sources to actually hear the truth that aren't going to be censored and that
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:25.480]  won't be silenced because the truth tellers and every single person watching this you are a true
[2:14:25.480 --> 2:14:29.880]  teller and you can stand up in your sphere of influence and you can make a difference because
[2:14:29.880 --> 2:14:34.600]  what the legacy media has seen is that we won't be silenced and we will go to alternative platforms
[2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:39.720]  because we are so willing to speak the truth and we are willing to defend this country i am proud
[2:14:39.720 --> 2:14:44.520]  to be an american because i love my country and i love what our founders gave to us which is the
[2:14:44.520 --> 2:14:49.560]  truth of the recognition of the declaration of independence that our rights come from god our
[2:14:49.560 --> 2:14:57.720]  creator not fauci not biden not the government jenna ellis former top lawyer for trump here with

[2:20:10.200 --> 2:20:14.200]  i remember when i remember i remember when i lost my mind
[2:20:14.200 --> 2:20:22.760]  there was something so pleasant about that place even your emotions had an echo in so much space
[2:20:25.880 --> 2:20:31.480]  all right the top former legal advisor to president trump jenna ellis
[2:20:31.480 --> 2:20:36.920]  host her own show that jenna ellis show.com is with us and i want you to have the floor
[2:20:36.920 --> 2:20:41.080]  for the rest of the hour because i can pick your brain all day and i want to get into all these
[2:20:41.080 --> 2:20:45.560]  big issues but first off how is president trump doing we know he's the real president
[2:20:46.200 --> 2:20:49.320]  a lot of sources i have to talk to him say he really is intending to run
[2:20:49.960 --> 2:20:55.000]  it'll probably announce obviously right after the midterms because now national campaigns
[2:20:55.000 --> 2:20:59.560]  are you're gonna have two years if so what's your view on that and what do you think the
[2:20:59.560 --> 2:21:03.800]  establishment's gonna try to do because they're trying to use obviously the whole january 6
[2:21:04.680 --> 2:21:09.800]  hysteria as some type of pretext to preclude him for running just like they did with marjorie
[2:21:09.800 --> 2:21:13.960]  taylor green and so many others so oh we don't want to steal an election but we want to keep
[2:21:13.960 --> 2:21:18.920]  people from running which is the same thing it is the same thing and they're not going to keep
[2:21:18.920 --> 2:21:24.200]  president trump from running and i think that he will run and i think he'll have a huge huge
[2:21:24.200 --> 2:21:28.520]  support and we see that through all of his rallies he's doing great and so you know i talk to him
[2:21:28.520 --> 2:21:33.880]  still frequently i've seen him uh down in mara lago a number of times recently and he cares about
[2:21:33.880 --> 2:21:38.920]  this country and you know my favorite moment every single rally is when he comes out on that stage
[2:21:38.920 --> 2:21:45.320]  to proud to be an american and he is cheering along with you know 50 000 of his closest friends
[2:21:45.320 --> 2:21:50.280]  and everyone else who is watching on tv and that's exactly who he is in person as well when you
[2:21:50.280 --> 2:21:56.200]  sit with him one on one he talks so much about how he loves this country he loves the constitution
[2:21:56.200 --> 2:22:01.080]  he loves that we have capitalism he loves freedom i mean all of these things that we should cherish
[2:22:01.080 --> 2:22:06.200]  and that's the reason that he left a very comfortable posh life to actually take a step down i mean
[2:22:06.200 --> 2:22:11.640]  think about that it throughout the course of our american history only one person has actually taken
[2:22:11.640 --> 2:22:16.200]  a step down by saying i'm going to go to the white house and that's donald trump and the only reason
[2:22:16.200 --> 2:22:20.840]  that he did that is because he loves this country so much and he is a fighter he's a fighter like
[2:22:20.840 --> 2:22:25.080]  you and me and he is not going to stop fighting for this country but you're right alex because the
[2:22:25.080 --> 2:22:33.000]  establishment has never liked him i saw with my own eyes the extent of the disgusting underbelly of
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:40.280]  the swamp when i was with him in dc and especially in the 2020 election when you had ronnie mcdaniel
[2:22:40.280 --> 2:22:46.440]  and you had the chief counsel justin reimer and you had all of these others in the rnc that literally
[2:22:46.440 --> 2:22:51.720]  were saying that what rudi juliani and jenna ellison are doing is a joke and we need to just
[2:22:51.720 --> 2:22:58.040]  let all of this go because we fundraise more when a democrat is in office that is how low they think
[2:22:58.040 --> 2:23:03.880]  of our rights that's how low they think of our country and the rnc is now just dnc light and
[2:23:03.880 --> 2:23:08.760]  so when that all came out i actually left the republican party i'm now a proud unassiliated
[2:23:08.760 --> 2:23:13.560]  because i'm just an ultra maga american we're actually care about this country and so i think
[2:23:13.560 --> 2:23:18.360]  the establishment is going to do everything that they can to convince or to discourage
[2:23:18.360 --> 2:23:23.560]  president trump from running but they know that this is his party these are his people and people
[2:23:23.560 --> 2:23:28.520]  like you and me are going to stand up and fight for this country and look in hindsight none of us
[2:23:28.520 --> 2:23:33.880]  are perfect i know trumps for real because i experienced the total demonization i got supporting
[2:23:33.880 --> 2:23:39.400]  him i watched the whole power structure turn against him and that's why the american people
[2:23:39.400 --> 2:23:44.840]  should still love him despite the fact he's not perfect on on every issue but on so many issues
[2:23:44.840 --> 2:23:52.920]  like trade and borders and and and taxes in the un he has been dead on absolutely and you know
[2:23:52.920 --> 2:23:59.000]  listen it's no secret that i didn't support trump going into the primary in 2016 i didn't know him i
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:02.520]  knew him just you know from the apprentice and i thought why would somebody like this be running
[2:24:02.520 --> 2:24:08.360]  for office and then i was convinced after i heard him in person come to colorado and speak
[2:24:08.360 --> 2:24:14.840]  and i saw his dedication i saw his passion in person and after i supported him and i proudly
[2:24:14.840 --> 2:24:20.440]  voted for him in 2016 i was so grateful to see that we had someone who was not a politician
[2:24:20.440 --> 2:24:25.480]  who would just stand up and do the things that our government should do which is to give power back
[2:24:25.480 --> 2:24:30.200]  to the people and that's why they hate him when he went and spoke at davos to the world economic
[2:24:30.200 --> 2:24:36.840]  forum in 2017 he became public enemy number one to the people like George Soros to clash fob to all
[2:24:36.840 --> 2:24:41.720]  of these other leftists and even members of the republican party like the dan krenshaw of the
[2:24:41.720 --> 2:24:47.720]  world and so president trump is absolutely a fighter and i think it's actually a good thing
[2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:52.680]  that we can change our mind when we have more information i wish that there were more people
[2:24:52.680 --> 2:24:57.240]  who could say you know what i was convinced one way but then i looked at the facts i looked at the
[2:24:57.240 --> 2:25:02.360]  evidence i heard rational argument and i changed my mind because we don't change our principles
[2:25:02.360 --> 2:25:07.560]  we know that we are adherents faithfully to the u.s constitution to the rule of law to god and
[2:25:07.560 --> 2:25:12.200]  country but when we get more information on a particular candidate like donald trump then of
[2:25:12.200 --> 2:25:16.280]  course we can change our minds but that's what the establishment doesn't want us to do they want to
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:21.000]  continue to vilify him they want to continue to vilify people like Doug mostriano in pennsylvania
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:25.640]  who's running for governor i'm helping with his campaign they're trying to call him an insurrectionist
[2:25:25.640 --> 2:25:31.880]  and the gop right before his primary in the week before they all tried to band together to try to
[2:25:31.880 --> 2:25:38.920]  cast him as the trump supported insurrectionist but he won with nearly 45 of the vote because the
[2:25:38.920 --> 2:25:44.760]  people in pennsylvania have said we have had enough and i think they reflect what everyone else in
[2:25:44.760 --> 2:25:52.360]  america feels and we're going to see that in 2022 and in 2024. Jenna Alice knowing the democrats
[2:25:52.360 --> 2:25:57.080]  and how they operate how do they get rid of biden what are they going to do i mean he's gone from
[2:25:57.080 --> 2:26:02.600]  a complete embarrassment to a spectacular disaster they're already it looks like laying the framework
[2:26:02.600 --> 2:26:09.000]  for somebody to discredit him but he's their god didn't we just get tamala harris or somebody else
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:13.640]  but i think we have a duty to go for impeachment even though we can't get it passed right now
[2:26:13.640 --> 2:26:17.080]  just to change the subject from january 6 and there are other distractions
[2:26:17.080 --> 2:26:23.480]  onto what he's done open borders uh gun control devaluing the currency cutting off the pipelines
[2:26:23.480 --> 2:26:27.720]  what's your view on how we should go after the the the democrats here in the midterms and beyond
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:33.240]  i heard your argument for impeachment and you're absolutely right because congress does have a
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:40.280]  duty when a president who is a sitting president is willfully ignoring the constitution and openly
[2:26:40.280 --> 2:26:44.760]  blatantly saying i'm ignoring the rule of law like what he did for all of the covid pandemic and
[2:26:44.760 --> 2:26:49.960]  the tyranny and all the topics he just mentioned congress has a duty then to remove him from office
[2:26:49.960 --> 2:26:54.680]  and everyone says well we don't like tamala the democrats tried really hard to make her happen
[2:26:54.680 --> 2:26:59.720]  she's a total embarrassment but we have to deal with that in the next step the first step is to
[2:26:59.720 --> 2:27:05.160]  say that joe biden not only is incompetent and the 25th amendment should absolutely come into
[2:27:05.160 --> 2:27:11.080]  play if his cabinet was serious about this country but congress absolutely has a duty to impeach not
[2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:17.800]  as retaliation for president trump but because of what joe biden himself has willfully ignored
[2:27:17.800 --> 2:27:23.880]  in our highest law of land if we don't hold our highest chief executive accountable then of course
[2:27:23.880 --> 2:27:27.560]  congress will get away with everything else so absolutely we need to impeach him
[2:27:27.560 --> 2:27:35.480]  what rabbits do you think the biden controllers i guess obama's third administration
[2:27:36.040 --> 2:27:40.360]  have up their sleep because all the evidence shows they're doomed not just a political
[2:27:40.360 --> 2:27:44.840]  landslide a political realignment is is is undoubted by all the analysts i agree with them
[2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:50.600]  what's your gut tell you they're going to do jenna i think they're going to change the narrative
[2:27:50.600 --> 2:27:55.480]  and how they're going to do that could be in a multitude of different ways like what we saw in
[2:27:55.480 --> 2:28:01.720]  2020 heading into 2020 we had the greatest economy you know president trump was so well loved i mean
[2:28:01.720 --> 2:28:07.640]  it was just a foregone conclusion he was going to win reelection and then they had the covet
[2:28:07.640 --> 2:28:13.400]  narrative and they promoted fear and so i think fear has worked for them and so just like a football
[2:28:13.400 --> 2:28:17.720]  coach if you run the play and the play works you continue running the play so i think they're going
[2:28:17.720 --> 2:28:23.640]  to change the narrative close to the midterms and then again in november of 2024 and they're
[2:28:23.640 --> 2:28:30.040]  going to use it by fear so that they can convince the low information americans to turn over more
[2:28:30.040 --> 2:28:35.160]  and more control to the government because if it worked for covet and you still see people with
[2:28:35.160 --> 2:28:39.480]  masks you still people you still see people getting the booster i mean i heard that california is
[2:28:39.480 --> 2:28:43.960]  going to reinstitute a mass mandate are you kidding me but if that works they're going to continue
[2:28:43.960 --> 2:28:48.760]  to run that play and that's right exactly so you're saying like roger stone said this morning on
[2:28:48.760 --> 2:28:55.160]  american journal they're planning to run the germ fear straight ahead we'll be right back if you're
[2:28:55.160 --> 2:28:59.800]  concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity
[2:28:59.800 --> 2:29:05.560]  this will be the most important message you'll hear this year here's why we now have a small

[2:29:52.120 --> 2:30:00.360]  at mysolarbackup.com the eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans
[2:30:00.360 --> 2:30:06.200]  they financed with universities they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their
[2:30:06.200 --> 2:30:11.080]  propaganda of the new york times other major newspapers that the family as we know it is a
[2:30:11.080 --> 2:30:16.840]  bad thing and must be ended the first step in that is getting women out of the households and
[2:30:16.840 --> 2:30:22.120]  teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a
[2:30:22.120 --> 2:30:27.320]  bad thing and i was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter my four national

[2:33:26.600 --> 2:33:36.200]  i've been on air 28 years
[2:33:41.160 --> 2:33:48.440]  and i've never lived in such an exciting and quite frankly dangerous time we are in the
[2:33:48.440 --> 2:33:55.640]  danger zone right now powerful corporate anti-free market monopoly forces using leftist for control
[2:33:55.640 --> 2:34:04.280]  ally with communist china drug cartels hollywood you name it are making their move on humanity
[2:34:04.280 --> 2:34:11.480]  because they're weak and because they know we have awoken and they are in pure culture war
[2:34:12.120 --> 2:34:19.080]  right now we have trumps former chief legal advisor jenna ellis the jenna ellis show dot com
[2:34:19.640 --> 2:34:24.120]  you also want to get into the attack on the second amendment and the whole lgbt attack
[2:34:24.120 --> 2:34:29.080]  on our children give us your view on that yeah let's start with the second amendment because
[2:34:29.080 --> 2:34:35.080]  you know the the left likes to trot this out whenever there is a narrative or a story or a
[2:34:35.080 --> 2:34:41.480]  tragedy like what unfolded in texas a couple of weeks ago and somehow then blame the object instead
[2:34:41.480 --> 2:34:47.480]  of the perpetrator and so you have to wonder why didn't they call for more mini van and suv controls
[2:34:47.480 --> 2:34:53.080]  after what happened in wakisha well because that doesn't fit their narrative and so instead of looking
[2:34:53.080 --> 2:34:59.800]  at why are we raising a generation of young men who so devalue human life that they are willing
[2:34:59.800 --> 2:35:06.440]  to go into a school and shoot up a school and how did we get to this point instead of addressing
[2:35:06.440 --> 2:35:13.400]  the fundamental worldview problem and the fact that they are so rejecting god and rejecting the
[2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:19.880]  image of god in people of course the left goes after the guns because that's the only way if they
[2:35:19.880 --> 2:35:25.640]  take away our guns they can get to their control and domination of society faster so we need to
[2:35:25.640 --> 2:35:30.840]  push back on this and i wrote a piece um probably it's back in 2018 for the federalist you can still
[2:35:30.840 --> 2:35:37.560]  see it online and it talks about for the federalist why our second amendment rights are not just
[2:35:37.560 --> 2:35:44.600]  about guns it's about human rights because if our government is able to have all of us be guilty
[2:35:44.600 --> 2:35:50.520]  based on a few individuals actions presumptively guilty and say well everyone has to have
[2:35:50.520 --> 2:35:55.800]  their second amendment protected rights taken away because of the few then what else can the
[2:35:55.800 --> 2:36:01.000]  government not preemptively say well you may speak something we don't like we're going to take away
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:06.280]  free speech you may worship in a way we don't agree with you don't have free exercise of religion
[2:36:06.280 --> 2:36:10.840]  you may associate with somebody like alex jones that we don't like so we're going to take away
[2:36:10.840 --> 2:36:17.560]  your right to free free association so that's what they do is presumptively say that everyone is
[2:36:17.560 --> 2:36:23.480]  guilty based on the narrative of the few and we have to push back on that and say no the government
[2:36:23.480 --> 2:36:30.120]  can never tell me i'm guilty of anything presumptively before i actually go and perpetrate a crime and
[2:36:30.120 --> 2:36:34.760]  even then they have to convince a jury of my peers that i'm guilty beyond any and all reasonable
[2:36:34.760 --> 2:36:42.520]  doubt and only at that point can they then impose a punishment or a criminal consequence you're
[2:36:42.520 --> 2:36:48.920]  talking about pre crime we we're not supposed to have pre crime in a free country yes hundred percent
[2:36:48.920 --> 2:36:55.480]  and we we can't ever have that because if we allow the government to say a class of people
[2:36:55.480 --> 2:37:01.960]  is guilty or even these red flag laws like oh you are showing markers you know i'm all for signs of
[2:37:01.960 --> 2:37:06.440]  you know mental health issues of getting people treatment that they need but those are all voluntary
[2:37:06.440 --> 2:37:11.400]  things that's not the government coming in and saying you resemble and have certain markers or
[2:37:11.400 --> 2:37:16.760]  certain affiliations like maybe you wear a red maga hat so now we're going to say that you are
[2:37:16.760 --> 2:37:21.400]  more likely to commit an offense than someone else and then take away your rights on a presumptive
[2:37:21.400 --> 2:37:26.520]  basis we never do that in this country we never can because of the way that our constitution is
[2:37:26.520 --> 2:37:32.680]  designed and we actually have a due process and due process matters to this country so much more
[2:37:32.680 --> 2:37:36.360]  than the left is giving it credit for on purpose because they just want control well that's right
[2:37:36.360 --> 2:37:42.120]  jen allis again a former chief legal advisor to president trump talk show host here with us today
[2:37:42.120 --> 2:37:47.640]  speaking of that not just due process not just presumption of innocence what about separation
[2:37:47.640 --> 2:37:52.920]  of powers this just broke in the last five minutes former trump advisor charged with contempt for
[2:37:52.920 --> 2:37:58.680]  defying january 6 subpoena i've sued the block mother subpoenas not that any of the hide it's
[2:37:58.680 --> 2:38:05.160]  just that it's not their business prosecutors have been died in mr revaro 72 saying he failed to
[2:38:05.160 --> 2:38:09.800]  appear for a deposition to provide documents congressional investigators and responses
[2:38:09.800 --> 2:38:16.600]  subpoenas issued by the federal house committee on january on february 9th the indictment charges
[2:38:16.600 --> 2:38:21.480]  him with two counts of contempt these carry a maximum sentence of a year in prison as well as a fine
[2:38:21.480 --> 2:38:29.240]  of $200,000 so he has been indicted by the political witch hunt the not even properly
[2:38:29.240 --> 2:38:36.520]  constituted committee i know you've been a target of this so have i where do you expect this
[2:38:36.520 --> 2:38:41.800]  classical witch hunt to go well they're going to continue to try to pursue this witch hunt until
[2:38:41.800 --> 2:38:47.400]  they see it going the way of the russia hoax and the malar investigation that finally no one cared
[2:38:47.400 --> 2:38:50.760]  and they saw it for the hoax that it was and so now they're saying that they're going to start these
[2:38:50.760 --> 2:38:56.200]  public hearings uh in just a few weeks or a few days and they're going to try to make this again a
[2:38:56.200 --> 2:39:01.080]  giant narrative that is completely and utterly false and the only reason that they keep using
[2:39:01.080 --> 2:39:06.280]  this term insurrection is because they're trying to tie it to the 14th amendment and they're trying
[2:39:06.280 --> 2:39:14.040]  to say that we're going to remove from office and also say that you that they're not qualified for
[2:39:14.040 --> 2:39:19.560]  reelection like marjorie taylor green madison cawthorn uh dug out walking trump from being able to
[2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:25.000]  run absolutely and that they get one success in that then they're going to call trump an
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:30.040]  insurrectionist and say hey you can't run they have tried in every way to stop him and they're
[2:39:30.040 --> 2:39:35.400]  manipulating and bastardizing the constitution in its text in order to try to stop trump they will
[2:39:35.400 --> 2:39:41.160]  stop at nothing well i know you can get hit with contempt of congress you're a lawyer i'm not but
[2:39:41.160 --> 2:39:45.640]  i've researched told them i'm wrong if you just don't show up that's why i took the fifth not that
[2:39:45.640 --> 2:39:49.800]  i didn't even hide but i knew they would twist whatever i said with the perjury trap or have
[2:39:49.800 --> 2:39:55.080]  some witness saying it was something else i didn't talk to trump nobody planned violence
[2:39:55.080 --> 2:39:59.240]  we had a bunch of rallies in the months before we had a rally on the fifth we were simply there to
[2:39:59.240 --> 2:40:04.520]  protest the election and say we wanted a 10-day congressional investigation that the democrats
[2:40:04.520 --> 2:40:10.120]  had tried to have just four years before and then the fact to learn they have these racketeering
[2:40:10.120 --> 2:40:16.840]  and anti-terror and sedition investigations going on uh for even myself and roger stone and people
[2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:20.760]  that were just putting on peaceful protest they're not trying to outlaw the first amendment this is
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:28.920]  so dangerous it is and you were i in my opinion you were very smart to go and plead the fifth and
[2:40:28.920 --> 2:40:34.840]  sit there because giving them the ability to pursue contempt of congress charges and contempt of
[2:40:35.400 --> 2:40:39.960]  whether or not the subpoena was valid and i don't think that it is a properly constituted committee
[2:40:39.960 --> 2:40:45.000]  i think you're right about that but the fact that they've issued the subpoena go sit leave the fifth
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:50.680]  and then they can't have an easy win so for people like navara for people like mark meadows and others
[2:40:50.680 --> 2:40:55.400]  who now have these contempt charges then they're going to have to mount a defense and it just gives
[2:40:55.400 --> 2:41:00.920]  the left another easy win instead of saying we know your political theater fine i'll show up but
[2:41:00.920 --> 2:41:05.240]  i'm not giving you anything because i have nothing to hide and in fact the supreme court even wrote
[2:41:05.240 --> 2:41:11.880]  an opinion saying that the fifth amendment specifically protects people who are victims of
[2:41:11.880 --> 2:41:18.120]  malicious prosecutions and political prosecutions that's right and then a famous ruling i forget
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:23.560]  the name you probably know it but it's not just for self-incrimination it's if you know there's a
[2:41:23.560 --> 2:41:28.440]  witch hunt and you know they're setting you up you have a right to not talk exactly and that's
[2:41:28.440 --> 2:41:33.400]  why the supreme court has said due process matters so i think you were very wise in that and you know
[2:41:33.400 --> 2:41:38.440]  they're just going to continue this but the good thing is is that everyone sees through this and
[2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:43.720]  it's only the idiots like the liz chainies who were the rhino republicans who hate trump and
[2:41:43.720 --> 2:41:48.840]  everyone who hates trump who is still thinking that this can even survive oh they know they've
[2:41:48.840 --> 2:41:54.680]  done national polls 90 percent care about the inflation and then that's basically it another
[2:41:54.680 --> 2:42:00.920]  40 percent about the borders depending on the poll no january 6 doesn't even show up it's not even
[2:42:00.920 --> 2:42:06.360]  a concern yeah nobody cares because they know that it's the next political theater and they're
[2:42:06.360 --> 2:42:11.560]  sick and tired of spending taxpayer dollars on this and spent and spending you know 40 billion
[2:42:11.560 --> 2:42:16.760]  dollars to ukraine when we don't even have baby formula we're paying eight dollars in gas prices
[2:42:16.760 --> 2:42:21.400]  and we don't have truckers for the supply chain because they've been fired because of the covid
[2:42:21.400 --> 2:42:25.560]  mandates i mean all of these things are what government should be addressing no one cares
[2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:31.080]  about their little you know prime time media hits so that they can put forward their political
[2:42:31.080 --> 2:42:35.400]  theater for january 6 and no one should care about that right and still we've got hundreds of people
[2:42:35.400 --> 2:42:40.760]  some of which weren't even violent still held in those gulags we come back on how about the rest
[2:42:40.760 --> 2:42:45.640]  of the left's agenda and how you predict it's going to unfold and how we beat it with our special

[2:47:23.240 --> 2:47:28.280]  white papers he's going to be hosting the fourth hour ahead of the war room with oan shroyer today
[2:47:28.280 --> 2:47:35.320]  at three p.m central here in about 70 minutes from now well jenna lin ellis the jenna ellis
[2:47:35.320 --> 2:47:42.040]  show dot com uh is a former senior legal advisor to president trump and we really appreciate her
[2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:47.640]  joining us here today we got 10 minutes left in this segment and i've got so many topics i want to
[2:47:47.640 --> 2:47:52.760]  raise but i want to ask you what else you want to impart to this audience and obviously we need to
[2:47:52.760 --> 2:48:00.360]  get into the whole lgbtqp movement and where you see that going yeah that is just a disaster for
[2:48:00.360 --> 2:48:06.200]  our children and when you look at the the leftist and these educators who are saying that children
[2:48:06.200 --> 2:48:14.520]  as young as four need to have sexual therapy because they need to understand the lgbtq movement
[2:48:14.520 --> 2:48:20.840]  it just shows that they are on purpose trying to program our children away from the truth
[2:48:20.840 --> 2:48:26.280]  that they know just because they are human beings made in the image of god and and understand
[2:48:26.280 --> 2:48:31.480]  reality as it's presented to them kids as young as four kids as young even as you know eight and
[2:48:31.480 --> 2:48:37.480]  nine they understand that there's boys and there's girls they understand that but it's the programming
[2:48:37.480 --> 2:48:41.640]  from the left that is trying to purposefully indoctrinate kids and the one thing i would say to
[2:48:41.640 --> 2:48:47.880]  parents if your child knows more about the worldview of mickey mouse than he does about the worldview
[2:48:47.880 --> 2:48:52.520]  of jesus christ in the bible that is on parents that is on the church it doesn't matter what these
[2:48:52.520 --> 2:48:57.880]  woke corporations are doing if you can make sure that you are raising your child and training him
[2:48:57.880 --> 2:49:02.200]  or her up in the way he should go because like what proverbs says when these older they will not
[2:49:02.200 --> 2:49:06.520]  depart from it and so we can push back against all of these woke corporations we can talk about
[2:49:06.520 --> 2:49:11.880]  policy but everything starts in the home and parents need to take more responsibility for
[2:49:11.880 --> 2:49:16.600]  raising the next generation the children do not belong to government or to community but that's
[2:49:16.600 --> 2:49:22.520]  what the left is trying to do so we have to fight back hard for parental rights as well well listen
[2:49:22.520 --> 2:49:27.880]  if i'm at the park and some 40 year old dude comes over on with my wife and children my five
[2:49:27.880 --> 2:49:32.040]  year old daughter and says i want to talk to daughter about sex we're gonna call the police
[2:49:32.040 --> 2:49:37.160]  or he's gonna get it you know he's gonna get his ass kicked they have wedded their sex call whether
[2:49:37.160 --> 2:49:42.360]  it's heterosexual or homosexual to their political movement and are demanding access to our children
[2:49:42.360 --> 2:49:49.560]  it's outrageous it's so ridiculous it's disgusting and it's vile and we have to stand up from
[2:49:49.560 --> 2:49:54.680]  land say no and this is the flip side of free speech because the first amendment does protect
[2:49:54.680 --> 2:50:01.400]  my right to speak what i believe but it also protects my right to not speak what i don't
[2:50:01.400 --> 2:50:07.000]  believe and that's incredibly important because the government is trying to compel you and me
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:12.760]  to participate in their lie and their narratives and affirm you know these transgender swimmers
[2:50:12.760 --> 2:50:19.320]  like lia thomas and to say that he's a girl he's not he's a he and we can say that and we should
[2:50:19.320 --> 2:50:23.720]  continue to say that and i don't care if i get canceled i don't care if i'm called all kinds of
[2:50:23.720 --> 2:50:29.320]  names i will speak the truth and i will never ever allow my government to tell me what i can or
[2:50:29.320 --> 2:50:36.920]  cannot say or what i have to say i don't ever talk to trump i know roger stone talks to him
[2:50:36.920 --> 2:50:41.880]  we have a few conversations i'm sure you still talk to trump and and again i only bring this up
[2:50:41.880 --> 2:50:46.920]  because it's got a lot of our listeners upset i know the process of what happened and i understand
[2:50:46.920 --> 2:50:51.560]  he meant well but i even know don jr you know talked to him about it a few months ago when
[2:50:51.560 --> 2:50:56.920]  he was still pushing the shots they were holding the country hostage they said sir we won't have
[2:50:56.920 --> 2:51:01.240]  a shot for two years and then but they even had this plan to get it done quicker he wanted to get
[2:51:01.240 --> 2:51:06.280]  the country out of the hostage control it was in knowing was causing mass suicide and depression
[2:51:06.280 --> 2:51:12.200]  and economic collapse and death in third world and so he went with warp speed and i think if
[2:51:12.200 --> 2:51:17.160]  trump explains that to people he'll be fine but i think the santas has pulled ahead of him
[2:51:17.800 --> 2:51:24.840]  with most people i talk to and i like the sanis as well because the sanis has been more vocal
[2:51:24.840 --> 2:51:31.400]  against the vaccine tyranny and i see that trump doesn't want to be hypocritical but he's not
[2:51:31.400 --> 2:51:36.840]  hypocritical just because the system tells him one thing and he does one thing doesn't mean he
[2:51:36.840 --> 2:51:41.800]  can't double back then or circle around his sock he says and say hey i was misled to a certain
[2:51:41.800 --> 2:51:47.960]  extent so i think the one big problem trumps god uh is the whole vaccine situation what's your view
[2:51:47.960 --> 2:51:55.320]  on that i think he needs to be perfectly clear that he has never ever advocated for compulsory
[2:51:55.320 --> 2:52:01.080]  vaccines he wanted that as an option and more options are fine some people i know and he's
[2:52:01.080 --> 2:52:07.720]  opposed given to kids absolutely but people don't hear that they just yeah they don't but that's
[2:52:07.720 --> 2:52:13.240]  what he has to make clear is that it was always just an option and hey the left is for pro-choice
[2:52:13.240 --> 2:52:18.760]  right and that should be in genuine matters of health care not abortions but genuine matters
[2:52:18.760 --> 2:52:23.000]  of health care we should have choices and that should be a consult with us and our doctor that's
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:27.080]  all that he's promoting and the thing that i find dangerous about the sanis i love what he's done
[2:52:27.080 --> 2:52:33.080]  for the state of florida but i'm very very concerned that he's overstepping his executive
[2:52:33.080 --> 2:52:39.000]  boundaries by just trying to go after what corporations in retaliation and will he continue
[2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:44.200]  to overstep the constitution in ways that the left is doing just because we like the outcome as
[2:52:44.200 --> 2:52:50.680]  conservatives doesn't make that okay and it sets a very dangerous precedent and president trump
[2:52:50.680 --> 2:52:55.640]  has always stayed within the margins of the constitution he loves this country and he loves
[2:52:55.640 --> 2:53:02.120]  the limited limited powers of government that's why during a whole pandemic he said i'm giving this
[2:53:02.120 --> 2:53:07.480]  to the states i'll provide resources information and support but this is a state and local matter
[2:53:07.480 --> 2:53:12.280]  and that was wise that was constitutional and so i trust president trump a lot more than i trust
[2:53:12.280 --> 2:53:17.400]  run to sanis right now in terms of staying within the margins of the constitution well i know this
[2:53:17.400 --> 2:53:21.080]  i got a little suspicious of the sanis and i'm not attacking the sanis because his fruits are
[2:53:21.080 --> 2:53:26.200]  really good right now but people like bill mar saying two years ago you know right right before
[2:53:26.200 --> 2:53:30.920]  you even got it up we like the sanis with Yale and all that there's you know there there seems
[2:53:30.920 --> 2:53:37.320]  like something going on there maybe he's breaking with them but but certainly parts of the establishment
[2:53:37.320 --> 2:53:42.760]  really like the sanis for some reason yeah and that's that is concerning because we have to know
[2:53:42.760 --> 2:53:48.360]  who would he bring in to staff the white house where his allegiance is what does he think of the
[2:53:48.360 --> 2:53:54.200]  rnc and those are all very valid questions and we saw that especially in the 2016 election and we
[2:53:54.200 --> 2:53:59.080]  saw that you know frankly i think that uh with president trump's next term um assuming he gets
[2:53:59.080 --> 2:54:03.720]  one and i would definitely be a fan of that uh that he's going to change a lot of the staffing
[2:54:03.720 --> 2:54:08.840]  issues and not trust to the rnc as much uh to staff and put people you know like the ranks
[2:54:08.840 --> 2:54:13.960]  purposes and you know some of these people in house that are so swampy he has consistently said he
[2:54:13.960 --> 2:54:18.840]  has to drain the swamp we don't know run to sanis this position on that so i love a lot of what
[2:54:18.840 --> 2:54:23.160]  run to sanis is doing i think if we didn't have the free state of florida we would be in a very
[2:54:23.160 --> 2:54:28.680]  different position i agree i mean i think the example of what other governors like in texas
[2:54:28.680 --> 2:54:32.840]  should be like i love the sanis i don't want to i'm just not going to be in a cult for trump or
[2:54:32.840 --> 2:54:37.320]  to sanis or anybody i want to look at trump's got an issue here to sanis has got an issue there
[2:54:37.320 --> 2:54:43.640]  we should get all on the table in closing without you giving in out of the inside baseball obviously
[2:54:43.640 --> 2:54:46.760]  i've talked to roger stone i've talked to a few others that have had long meetings with trump
[2:54:47.400 --> 2:54:52.040]  when he first got the elections stolen he wasn't going to run he said he was done but when he saw
[2:54:52.040 --> 2:54:55.720]  the country being screwed over by biden he said yeah i'm going to do it i know he told sources
[2:54:55.720 --> 2:55:01.000]  of mine in the last few months no i'm running 100 it's done he's pretty much said so in public but
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:05.080]  can you elaborate without giving out any internal info you're saying he is running
[2:55:06.520 --> 2:55:11.960]  i'm saying he's a fighter and i believe that he will run yes i think he's running and i think
[2:55:11.960 --> 2:55:17.000]  that he is rallying to that effect and saying you know hey we're going to take back washington
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:21.400]  we're going to take back the white house he is saying that without saying it because he's focused
[2:55:21.400 --> 2:55:27.000]  on the midterms right now and i think we will see a donald trump come back in 2024 and i'm ready for
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:33.080]  it but like you i will still criticize the things that i don't like about any leader we should not
[2:55:33.080 --> 2:55:38.120]  be members of a cult we should be in favor of people like donald trump who are willing to
[2:55:38.120 --> 2:55:43.400]  stand firm for this country and we should support him because even though well he's not perfect he
[2:55:43.400 --> 2:55:48.120]  is so fantastic he has been the best president of my lifetime and i love and support himself
[2:55:48.120 --> 2:55:52.520]  perfectly said yeah the only cult i meant is the left calls is christianity and that means the real
[2:55:52.520 --> 2:55:57.000]  god of the bible that's the only king i've got is king jesus jenna ellis very impressive thank you

[2:58:53.000 --> 2:58:58.280]  real short where the other patricks can get on the line uh alex i have to promote one thing from one
[2:58:58.280 --> 2:59:04.520]  of your co-host oan shroyer supermail volatility and brain force putt mix those two together
[2:59:04.520 --> 2:59:09.880]  you're an unstoppable tank supermail volatility really really works it's cold pressed herbs
[2:59:09.880 --> 2:59:16.360]  and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to
[2:59:16.360 --> 2:59:21.400]  powdered versions that also work quite well but just aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine
[2:59:21.400 --> 2:59:25.560]  it's it's it's in fact each batch is different sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just
[2:59:25.560 --> 2:59:29.240]  okay people like why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch is in a strong
[2:59:29.240 --> 2:59:35.080]  that's just how it is it's how it works uh so it's always good it should sometimes it's like super
[2:59:35.080 --> 2:59:39.480]  strong but yeah if you want the rolls royce at a decent price then this is it
[2:59:39.480 --> 2:59:51.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:59:59.160 --> 3:00:03.080]  welcome back to the alex jones on your guest host j dire jess analysis
[3:00:04.200 --> 3:00:09.240]  today is an important day because we have bill berg bill berg is going on of course
[3:00:09.240 --> 3:00:14.520]  it's secret secret for many years in the sense that uh people kind of knew it existed
[3:00:14.520 --> 3:00:18.760]  and it was one of these big international steering committee types of meetings with
[3:00:18.760 --> 3:00:23.560]  corporate elite a lot of the heads of media a lot of people from a trilateral commission
[3:00:23.560 --> 3:00:29.560]  from the cfr and they would meet at bill berg but the the press would typically not report this
[3:00:29.560 --> 3:00:32.920]  i mean you would think that the most the most powerful people in the world the wealthiest
[3:00:32.920 --> 3:00:41.240]  CEOs getting together and discussing global policy would be something worthy of media attention
[3:00:41.240 --> 3:00:45.800]  and yet we would only find typically kind of occasional stories here and there maybe in the
[3:00:45.800 --> 3:00:50.920]  european press there might be a story here or there but nobody really talked about it because
[3:00:50.920 --> 3:00:57.000]  of course there was quite a bit of clampdown and it was intentionally not discussed but to find out
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:01:02.760]  the real origins of bill berg of course there's quite a few books out there now but most famously
[3:01:02.760 --> 3:01:07.320]  uh which you guys have heard me talk about many times in the fourth hour is david rockefeller's
[3:01:07.320 --> 3:01:12.760]  own memoirs and to really understand the purpose of these institutions steering committees
[3:01:12.760 --> 3:01:17.560]  angios think tanks etc they all kind of fall under the banner of this global elite plan
[3:01:18.280 --> 3:01:24.440]  it helps to go to the man himself david rockefeller now the council for relations itself was set up
[3:01:24.440 --> 3:01:29.640]  as one of these kind of steering committees in 1921 at the behest of the rockefellers
[3:01:29.640 --> 3:01:35.480]  and it was intended to be an entity that would help steer global policy modeled on
[3:01:36.040 --> 3:01:41.800]  what dr carol quickly talks about in his books on chatham house on the royal institute for
[3:01:41.800 --> 3:01:46.920]  international affairs on pratt house and so forth all these things are kind of models of what they
[3:01:46.920 --> 3:01:53.720]  call roundtable groups and the roundtable groups are again a strategy a type of governance coming
[3:01:53.720 --> 3:01:58.760]  out of the british empire in the waning of the british empire you have the rise of the american
[3:01:58.760 --> 3:02:04.200]  empire to replace it and no figure i don't in my view is it more important than david rockefeller
[3:02:04.200 --> 3:02:09.400]  i mean i think he's really the pivot man here obviously other families that are important
[3:02:09.400 --> 3:02:14.840]  obviously the the joining of the roth child and rockefeller fortunes some years ago was an important
[3:02:14.840 --> 3:02:20.920]  move but um in the early phases of the 20th century it's really the rockefeller family
[3:02:20.920 --> 3:02:28.120]  that dominates this whole arena and they also extended this influence to many other meetings
[3:02:28.120 --> 3:02:33.080]  which again david rockefeller openly talks about in this famous chapter now maybe uh
[3:02:33.080 --> 3:02:38.120]  you don't want to read this big you know boring 600 page 700 page book which is understandable
[3:02:38.120 --> 3:02:42.280]  500 pages excuse me but if you want to really understand what's going on you just need to
[3:02:42.280 --> 3:02:46.120]  look at one chapter and that's chapter 27 and that's what we're going to talk about first then
[3:02:46.120 --> 3:02:53.160]  we'll look at some more about builder bird um but the whole chapter is called proud internationalist
[3:02:53.160 --> 3:03:00.200]  proud internationalist and the idea here is that the world needs to be restructured according to
[3:03:00.200 --> 3:03:04.200]  what you when you hear people talk about the new world order this is what's being talked about
[3:03:04.200 --> 3:03:09.080]  okay it's not a shadowy unknown thing it's not some thing that people are just throwing around
[3:03:09.080 --> 3:03:14.360]  i don't know what it is but uh it's just this term that's so much no it's a very precise very clear
[3:03:14.360 --> 3:03:23.800]  public thing in all of these big fact global elite texts and chapter 27 is all about that
[3:03:23.800 --> 3:03:29.240]  it's called proud internationalist and it begins with a quote and it says in my lifetime the pursuits
[3:03:30.040 --> 3:03:38.200]  as an internationalist might best be summarized by my extraordinary day in 1995 and what he's
[3:03:38.200 --> 3:03:47.480]  talking about in 1995 relates to the cfr united nations and what he calls a kind of capitalist
[3:03:47.480 --> 3:03:52.360]  mechanism for restructuring the world it's a new way to structure the world and he says now a lot
[3:03:52.360 --> 3:03:57.880]  of people don't like this a lot of people have said hey uh you're part of uh some a communist
[3:03:57.880 --> 3:04:03.800]  conspiracy and he says it's neither capitalist nor communist it's a new way of approaching all this
[3:04:03.800 --> 3:04:10.120]  now he is a monopoly capitalist but if you guys everybody knows right he wrote the two editorials
[3:04:10.120 --> 3:04:15.320]  where he famously said that mal's china is a great experiment nothing wrong with it
[3:04:15.320 --> 3:04:19.880]  we know that the os s train mal's gorillas and so a lot of people like yale skull and bones they
[3:04:19.880 --> 3:04:26.600]  were actually for malism and they did that to restructure and change the landscape of china
[3:04:27.160 --> 3:04:31.880]  and david ruckfull has chapters in the middle of this book by the way about putting chase bank
[3:04:31.880 --> 3:04:38.280]  in communist china restructuring china his positive attitude towards china because he
[3:04:38.280 --> 3:04:44.280]  felt that it could also be a eugenics based technocratic government eventually right and
[3:04:44.280 --> 3:04:50.280]  that's of course where we see china going all of the best of these western powers and support now
[3:04:50.280 --> 3:04:54.440]  when we come back we're going to get into what is internationalism on the alex jones show the

[3:05:59.560 --> 3:06:04.360]  welcome back to the alex jones show and your guest host j dire of jays analysis we are discussing
[3:06:04.920 --> 3:06:11.800]  first ideas of the internationalist clique the monopoly capitalist and their greatest allies
[3:06:11.800 --> 3:06:19.000]  and tools the socialist communists and how they both share a common ideology of creating a global
[3:06:19.000 --> 3:06:26.440]  single monoculture that would be the international new world order and for people that are skeptics
[3:06:26.440 --> 3:06:32.120]  today rockefeller has a giant chapter in his giant book on it again one of the wealthiest men in
[3:06:32.120 --> 3:06:36.520]  the history of the country one of the most influential the steered the path of america
[3:06:36.520 --> 3:06:41.640]  basically uh through his family through their funding through their foundations through the united
[3:06:41.640 --> 3:06:46.040]  nations through all of these different entities that they helped set up including the cfr trial
[3:06:46.040 --> 3:06:50.840]  lateral commission institute for pacific relations all of which are described at length in dr kill
[3:06:50.840 --> 3:06:56.680]  quickly stretching hope as well and in this chapter rockefeller says that well a lot of
[3:06:56.680 --> 3:07:01.400]  people are not happy with this because they get confused and they think well is he a capitalist
[3:07:01.400 --> 3:07:07.240]  but that he says he supports socialism and now is what's going on here and of course he goes on
[3:07:07.240 --> 3:07:11.240]  to say that it's not really about either either of those things right ultimately this is about
[3:07:12.120 --> 3:07:18.680]  he says what people call a secret cabal they say that david rockefeller is part of an
[3:07:19.320 --> 3:07:26.280]  influential conspiracy a secret cabal to change the world into an international single global
[3:07:26.280 --> 3:07:34.840]  world order and especially a single economic structure and he says not only do i agree with
[3:07:34.840 --> 3:07:45.880]  this i stand guilty of this and i am proud of it and i am proud of it low iq skeptics can you
[3:07:45.880 --> 3:07:53.960]  read do you see what that says it says and i am proud of it i even put right there for you famous
[3:07:53.960 --> 3:08:00.920]  quote okay and you see that the people are i mean it's amazing the sort of doubling down delusion
[3:08:00.920 --> 3:08:06.440]  right that people get into when they just ah nothing says you're crazy conspiracy and then
[3:08:06.440 --> 3:08:13.000]  it's right here on the page can you read can you read he says the people that oppose me he says i
[3:08:13.000 --> 3:08:18.360]  would call them populists you mean people who actually support the idea of humans and other
[3:08:18.360 --> 3:08:24.680]  people right that's what he means by populism and not being ruled by money obsessed oligarchs
[3:08:25.560 --> 3:08:30.840]  he says those are populists this is populist call it a conspiracy but you know what's funny
[3:08:30.840 --> 3:08:35.800]  in a lot of these guys writings they say well it's not a conspiracy right which there are normie
[3:08:35.800 --> 3:08:40.600]  minions in the media say ha ha see there's no conspiracy he says he's not part of a conspiracy
[3:08:41.800 --> 3:08:46.440]  well clearly it's not a conspiracy if he says he's not in one but then he goes on to say
[3:08:46.440 --> 3:08:54.760]  hey it's not a conspiracy because it's in the open so that's what he says he says yeah there's
[3:08:54.760 --> 3:08:59.720]  no secret conspiracy because it's all in the open it's in the book okay so it's not a secret
[3:08:59.720 --> 3:09:08.200]  conspiracy if the book says publicly as a bestseller new york times bestseller that yeah i'm
[3:09:08.200 --> 3:09:15.480]  here trying to come here trying to cruel government okay so again uh it shouldn't be a problem and then
[3:09:15.480 --> 3:09:23.320]  he says here are some of the institutions that we help set up and fund to create this international
[3:09:23.320 --> 3:09:29.880]  order the united nations the rock filler family donated the land or the united nations the world
[3:09:29.880 --> 3:09:37.320]  trade organization the international monetary fund and we also help get nafta done and he says anybody
[3:09:37.320 --> 3:09:45.800]  that opposes this we just call them isolationists isolationists remember ron paul well i think we need
[3:09:45.800 --> 3:09:50.440]  to we need an honest fatal reserve well i'm just i'm not knocking i like ron paul it's just you
[3:09:50.440 --> 3:09:54.920]  know i gotta like to do impressions okay they'll get mad people say why is he impersonating ron paul
[3:09:54.920 --> 3:10:00.360]  somebody kill him i like ron paul i'm just being goofy okay well i think we need to honestly
[3:10:01.320 --> 3:10:06.840]  well ron paul was right and what do they call ron paul right back in 2007 eight right he's a
[3:10:06.840 --> 3:10:12.280]  isolationist he doesn't want american bold in the global economy but no no it's because it's a scam
[3:10:12.280 --> 3:10:16.360]  okay do you understand that the real way the world is run is on the basis of scams
[3:10:17.640 --> 3:10:24.120]  okay and of course right ron paul great politician and statesman was able to see that he was right
[3:10:25.080 --> 3:10:30.360]  and not just ron paul i mean many people even in public in the public sphere right
[3:10:31.960 --> 3:10:36.280]  previous even ronald reagan at one point even talked about this right when he was running
[3:10:36.280 --> 3:10:41.800]  he would talk about cfr he would talk about the un he would talk about these kinds of
[3:10:41.800 --> 3:10:46.680]  things being a problem uh and well i think everybody knows kind of what maybe happened
[3:10:46.680 --> 3:10:52.040]  to ronald reagan at one point when he talked about those things but david ron paul says yeah all
[3:10:52.040 --> 3:10:56.920]  of these institutions we are involved in this and these are all to create first of all a global
[3:10:56.920 --> 3:11:03.400]  economic order if we create a global economic order then what will naturally flow from that
[3:11:03.400 --> 3:11:10.760]  that is a single world currency a single world technocratic order that we can then control first
[3:11:10.760 --> 3:11:17.080]  and foremost through the currency through the economy so as everybody knows their economic
[3:11:17.080 --> 3:11:22.920]  model is a debt based fiat system it's where central banking entities that are privately owned
[3:11:22.920 --> 3:11:28.680]  can print as much money as they want and everybody that's in this the more conservative austrian
[3:11:28.680 --> 3:11:33.720]  school of economics etc people that believe that there should be sound monetary policy
[3:11:33.720 --> 3:11:39.480]  what does everybody in that camp always said right you can't have a fiat system this this
[3:11:39.480 --> 3:11:44.600]  shock doctrine system will destroy the economy and ever since the shock doctrine what has happened
[3:11:45.400 --> 3:11:51.800]  gigantic national debt going crazy trillions of dollars trillions of trillions more print more
[3:11:51.800 --> 3:11:56.680]  coup fit what was that well i did videos when the coup fit narrative first started happening
[3:11:56.680 --> 3:12:02.760]  and saying this is an economic attack this is an attack on the economy and then what happens
[3:12:04.520 --> 3:12:10.040]  massive centralization of wealth putting massive amounts right of middle class people
[3:12:10.680 --> 3:12:17.640]  small business owners out of business now you got to go to amazon walmart etc all of those
[3:12:17.640 --> 3:12:23.480]  corporations were intimately connected to and involved in this gigantic scam
[3:12:23.480 --> 3:12:32.680]  look at gill baits right he just happens to have the answers he's going to sell you baby formula
[3:12:32.680 --> 3:12:38.200]  he's going to sell you beyond me fake me because of the crises that suddenly occur
[3:12:39.320 --> 3:12:44.680]  so the inflation the money printing and they just gaslight everybody right they knew good and well
[3:12:44.680 --> 3:12:50.040]  when when they printed all of those stimulus checks and all the bonuses and all that that
[3:12:50.040 --> 3:12:53.640]  we would later we would have to pay for it now we're all paying for all of this
[3:12:54.280 --> 3:12:56.920]  want to pay devising money printing scant debt scams
[3:12:59.880 --> 3:13:05.880]  and it's it's theft of wealth and energy over time that's what all this is inflation is stealing
[3:13:05.880 --> 3:13:11.480]  from you over time in a gradual way but because it's gradual you don't notice it right your
[3:13:11.480 --> 3:13:17.880]  honey buns go from a dollar fifty to a dollar seventy five to two dollars in a few years right
[3:13:17.880 --> 3:13:21.800]  right by the way you shouldn't be eating honey buns don't ever eat honey but disgusting
[3:13:24.120 --> 3:13:27.720]  but it seems like basically all of the cells like everybody just lives on honey buns because
[3:13:27.720 --> 3:13:33.000]  everybody in the south is now gigantic by the way stop eating garbage food everybody listen
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:38.840]  stop eating honey buns why are you anything when you go in the grocery store basically only eat
[3:13:38.840 --> 3:13:43.400]  things that are on the out outer rim of the grocery store that's it anything in the middle
[3:13:43.400 --> 3:13:51.160]  do not eat that that's lesson number one today don't eat anything that has bill gates is food
[3:13:51.160 --> 3:13:55.800]  crap i don't eat anything none of that okay bill gates wants you eating honey buns don't eat honey
[3:13:55.800 --> 3:14:02.280]  buns now the honeymoon companies are going to try to expose me anyway so the internationalists
[3:14:02.280 --> 3:14:09.080]  they want to set up this connected global order through economy first and foremost that's what the
[3:14:09.080 --> 3:14:14.920]  20th century and its wars were all about erecting this global order remember tragedy and hope says
[3:14:15.480 --> 3:14:19.880]  the two world wars the 20th century were about erecting the league of nations then the united
[3:14:19.880 --> 3:14:27.000]  nations and then through the cold war further integration into the synthesis of eastern block
[3:14:27.000 --> 3:14:34.280]  communism western monopoly capitalism right put these two together the hegelian synthesis
[3:14:34.280 --> 3:14:41.160]  problem reaction solution and what you get out of that is the nascent world order that is what
[3:14:41.160 --> 3:14:46.360]  is being rolled out right now again do you guys understand everybody's now heard about class
[3:14:46.360 --> 3:14:49.560]  they've heard about the world economic form they've heard about bill bergen these groups
[3:14:50.440 --> 3:14:53.800]  but do they realize that they've been meeting for years and years and years and years
[3:14:54.920 --> 3:15:01.160]  talking about the very things that david rockabiller says these things were created to create
[3:15:01.160 --> 3:15:07.160]  it imf wto napta un cfr trilateral
[3:15:09.240 --> 3:15:13.080]  bill berg there's a section in here on bill berger which we're going to look at in a minute
[3:15:16.200 --> 3:15:21.640]  he says that what i would call these entities like the cfr and so forth he says these are
[3:15:22.200 --> 3:15:28.360]  influencers these are influencing societies that's what they're about so do they control everything
[3:15:28.360 --> 3:15:34.200]  as the people do when when people counter us with their uh red herrings and straw men
[3:15:34.200 --> 3:15:38.280]  well you think the builder bird controls everything in the world no no no nobody ever said that
[3:15:39.480 --> 3:15:44.760]  they're steering committees policy planning committees debate committees and what he calls
[3:15:44.760 --> 3:15:50.440]  influencers they influence the formation of american policy he says don't go anywhere this

[3:19:59.800 --> 3:20:19.480]  welcome back to the alex jones i'm your guest host j dire of j's analysis just finishing up
[3:20:19.480 --> 3:20:25.560]  played a hot honey buns and uh i wanted to move on to the next section where we discover that
[3:20:25.560 --> 3:20:32.440]  david rockfeller is a big fan a big promoter the origins of the bilderberg group so as he
[3:20:32.440 --> 3:20:37.080]  moves on in page 4 10 of his biography by the way i did want to read one quote before we got to
[3:20:37.080 --> 3:20:43.320]  bilderberg where the rockfeller says on page 3 24 the powers of international capital had a far
[3:20:43.320 --> 3:20:48.920]  reaching plan no less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands to
[3:20:48.920 --> 3:20:55.160]  dominate the political systems of every country and the economy of all the world as a whole
[3:20:55.160 --> 3:20:59.000]  the secret is that they have annexed from governments monarchies and republics the power
[3:20:59.000 --> 3:21:08.280]  to create the world's money that is from dr carol quigley and that is page 3 24 of tragedy and hope
[3:21:08.840 --> 3:21:14.680]  and that's exactly the same model and message that we're going to see over here in david rockfeller
[3:21:14.680 --> 3:21:21.400]  there's another great quote by the way from a lesser known book by professor steven doral with the
[3:21:21.400 --> 3:21:28.520]  secret history of mi6 and i read that book many many years ago a lot of people don't know the real
[3:21:28.520 --> 3:21:39.720]  history of mi6 but he wrote that well this is from me quoting him that in his book on mi6 he
[3:21:39.720 --> 3:21:45.000]  mentions bilderberg in an effort to cement western cooperation throughout the cold war
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:21:49.560]  the first bilderberg conference was held in may in the small dutch town of usterveck
[3:21:49.560 --> 3:21:54.760]  at the hotel of bilderberg from which the meeting took its name it was seen as an opportunity for
[3:21:54.760 --> 3:21:59.720]  shapers of opinion among elite groups in europe to speak with one voice to their counterparts in
[3:21:59.720 --> 3:22:05.640]  the u.s so again clearly a global identity who feared the differences of european integration
[3:22:05.640 --> 3:22:10.280]  and eastern europe that those would create misunderstanding funding came courtesy of the
[3:22:10.280 --> 3:22:18.440]  dutch government and the cia that is steven doral's book mi6 page 508 that is a main line history
[3:22:18.440 --> 3:22:23.560]  of mi6 that is not a conspiracy book i'm so tired of all the conspiracy accusation
[3:22:24.360 --> 3:22:30.920]  but by the way that's a legal term where if people are conspiring to do something criminal
[3:22:30.920 --> 3:22:38.680]  you're charged with conspiracy so first of all it's not a made-up thing the criminal action
[3:22:38.680 --> 3:22:44.920]  when you're convicted of it number two if you could just replace it with the word espionage
[3:22:44.920 --> 3:22:49.320]  then i'm pretty sure most people would admit that espionage occurs okay well that's conspiring
[3:22:49.960 --> 3:22:55.560]  and if espionage occurs and you can just call it espionage theory and main line books on the
[3:22:55.560 --> 3:23:04.680]  history of espionage contain revealing clear sections on what bilderberg is again steven doral
[3:23:04.680 --> 3:23:13.240]  d o r i l l mi6 famous well-known book public academic not a conspiracy text they have rockfellas
[3:23:13.240 --> 3:23:19.640]  memoirs public academic history text well i don't guess it's academic it's just his autobiography
[3:23:20.680 --> 3:23:26.760]  and on page 410 he was on to say let's talk about bilderberg he said now conspiracy theorists love
[3:23:26.760 --> 3:23:36.440]  to talk about it but he says it's not a conspiracy because it's in the open it's the open conspiracy
[3:23:36.440 --> 3:23:44.920]  where we heard that oh i just covered that last week hg wells open conspiracy book now
[3:23:45.560 --> 3:23:51.640]  is it hard to prove or to demonstrate that they have the same plan from hg wells to david rockfeller
[3:23:51.640 --> 3:23:57.880]  to claus wobb no it's not hard number one they're all part of the same entity the same power structure
[3:23:57.880 --> 3:24:05.480]  royal society baby and socialists all together the same structure the royal society international
[3:24:05.480 --> 3:24:10.440]  institute royal society of international affairs royal institute for national affairs
[3:24:11.800 --> 3:24:17.880]  roundtable groups quickly rockfeller talk about it in their books same thing same power structure
[3:24:20.520 --> 3:24:27.720]  claus royal economic forum claus formerly chairman of bilderberg group not hard to figure out
[3:24:27.720 --> 3:24:35.800]  who helped set up claus endavos henry kissinger harvard herman conne ran corporation in the ci
[3:24:36.600 --> 3:24:40.680]  again johnny bedmore winnie webb they did the lengthy expose covering all that
[3:24:41.880 --> 3:24:49.320]  it's all now well known now who helped set up bilderberg prince burnhard formerly of the ss
[3:24:49.320 --> 3:24:55.480]  okay so by the way i forgot to mention uh dav rockfeller had said earlier in this chapter
[3:24:55.480 --> 3:25:02.680]  that uh the key role in help setting up the cfr was john falster dullas
[3:25:04.200 --> 3:25:12.760]  who was involved with and kissinger by the way and and sent to operation paperclip okay so there
[3:25:12.760 --> 3:25:18.920]  is a nazi element of this why people get tripped up in the different sides of this uh communist
[3:25:18.920 --> 3:25:26.200]  socialist capitalist nazi no they're all at the higher levels run by super wealthy people
[3:25:26.200 --> 3:25:30.840]  and they don't really care so much about the ideologies now something like nazism is
[3:25:30.840 --> 3:25:34.280]  falling out of favor right there used to be a time period when a lot of people in
[3:25:34.280 --> 3:25:39.640]  the british establishment were very openly pro hitler people in america were time magazine had
[3:25:39.640 --> 3:25:44.120]  him on the cover of time magazine right so there was a time period when there were people pro hitler
[3:25:44.120 --> 3:25:49.400]  in the establishment then that kind of that's not really feasible anymore and so you get people
[3:25:49.400 --> 3:25:55.320]  like julian huxley who wrote the philosophy of unesco part of the same cadre we're gonna have
[3:25:55.320 --> 3:26:02.440]  to change the terminology let's just rebrand this to not be depopulation and eugenics we'll call it
[3:26:02.440 --> 3:26:10.520]  biometrics and uh health all right so let's rebrand it as a biometrics and and genetic health
[3:26:10.520 --> 3:26:21.880]  right women's rights and health is all just rebranded variants of eugenics and rockefeller is very
[3:26:21.880 --> 3:26:27.640]  open about that it's just yeah we created this entity with people like prince bernard with eugenics
[3:26:27.640 --> 3:26:35.000]  who adamantly believe these views and he said this is really uh together with etienne davignon
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:40.280]  this is the origins of bilderberg and he talks about there being scandals he talks about there
[3:26:40.280 --> 3:26:48.520]  being secret interior groups um he says even opus day had a role in helping set up these things
[3:26:48.520 --> 3:26:55.080]  which of course was a roman catholic cia connected sort of front group all had a role in this and
[3:26:55.080 --> 3:27:02.360]  something he calls the parenti group playing a key role in helping to set up bilderberg he says but
[3:27:02.360 --> 3:27:09.800]  these are not menacing secret societies he says they're just secret groups that connected
[3:27:09.800 --> 3:27:16.120]  together with the cia the vatican and other entities to promote ultimately our internationalist
[3:27:16.120 --> 3:27:23.000]  order now that's not me that's not a conspiracy theorist saying that that is page 413 where
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:29.400]  david rockefeller talks about opus day and the vatican and the cia all kind of collaborating
[3:27:29.400 --> 3:27:38.120]  and working together to help put together this international steering policy debate influence
[3:27:38.120 --> 3:27:44.680]  committee okay so no bilderberg doesn't control every event in the world okay we're not schizophrenics
[3:27:44.680 --> 3:27:50.920]  we're people who revoke so that's it and he says that really it's just the top
[3:27:51.800 --> 3:27:58.600]  corporate elite right of the world so the idea is let's get together the top CEOs of the fortune
[3:27:58.600 --> 3:28:06.440]  100 slash fortune 500 and we will coordinate policies there and try to have a unified agenda
[3:28:06.440 --> 3:28:14.360]  for steering the world steering committee corporate collectivism okay i've been writing
[3:28:14.360 --> 3:28:18.600]  about bilderberg for at least 10 years in essays and podcasts and whatnot and i was looking back
[3:28:18.600 --> 3:28:27.000]  at some of my old essays i did one in 2014 eight years ago and there it was i called it i called
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:32.040]  one of my articles corporate communism that may not be it but so i've written at least three
[3:28:32.040 --> 3:28:36.120]  big long essays over the years on bilderberg and its history and one of them is called corporate
[3:28:36.120 --> 3:28:43.640]  communism because that's an accurate description right it's communism for everybody else uh a
[3:28:43.640 --> 3:28:48.680]  corporate managerial class on top of them and then a super rich class on top of them that's the
[3:28:48.680 --> 3:28:52.440]  pyramid that's how the world really works okay don't go anywhere the ceo's Jones show we're
[3:28:52.440 --> 3:28:57.480]  covering bilderberg you know listeners call into the show and they thank me and it makes me feel

[3:32:52.120 --> 3:33:03.640]  spear you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:11.080 --> 3:33:16.120]  welcome back to the oxygen so i want to remind everybody i'm not suicidal if i turn up dead
[3:33:16.120 --> 3:33:22.040]  it is the honey bun industrial complex that had me liquidated you know i go to walmart i see
[3:33:22.040 --> 3:33:30.360]  scooters i see i see armies of scooters people that can't even walk boomer scooters just rolling
[3:33:30.360 --> 3:33:39.960]  around and it's because people are eating things that aren't food honey buns hashtag stop the honey
[3:33:39.960 --> 3:33:47.560]  buns you know i was uh looking through this book and i was just reminded at how transparent all this
[3:33:47.560 --> 3:33:52.520]  is as i was flipping through uh it's been many years since i looked at uh rockfiller's memoirs
[3:33:52.520 --> 3:33:56.920]  and then there's also another important book of course very famous um probably most everybody's
[3:33:56.920 --> 3:34:01.560]  heard of it the true story the bill berg route which is the kind of the classic history uh of
[3:34:01.560 --> 3:34:05.480]  bill berg but there's another book too that's really important that people should be familiar
[3:34:05.480 --> 3:34:10.520]  with because it really puts another angle and it's a big puzzle piece for what we're talking
[3:34:10.520 --> 3:34:16.440]  about today and that's the famous professor anthony sutton's book wall street and the bolshevik
[3:34:16.440 --> 3:34:22.920]  revolution right where he goes into the true story of the history of the wealthy industrial
[3:34:22.920 --> 3:34:29.800]  banking elites including industrialists not just bankers but also industrials who really helped
[3:34:29.800 --> 3:34:37.320]  bolshevism and the soviet union build up to be what it was to have the cold war
[3:34:38.600 --> 3:34:44.760]  and again to most sort of normie left right political minded people they just cannot figure
[3:34:44.760 --> 3:34:49.400]  this out right it just blows their mind right it's just what how could a rich there's no rich
[3:34:49.400 --> 3:34:55.080]  person who would fund a communist because he's he's his enemy they hate commies there's the
[3:34:55.080 --> 3:35:00.920]  commies and the rich people in there in a fight who would actually believe such a naive it's so
[3:35:00.920 --> 3:35:09.640]  so it's so naive who do you think funds the revolutions did ever occur to you maybe that
[3:35:09.640 --> 3:35:15.880]  revolutions require money okay and typically revolutionaries don't have a lot of money right
[3:35:15.880 --> 3:35:23.640]  i mean like college dudes right on like living mooching off of everyone else in the dorms the
[3:35:23.640 --> 3:35:29.560]  real commies on the streets they are they usually pretty wealthy not really okay maybe they're trust
[3:35:29.560 --> 3:35:33.640]  fund kids every now and then okay so who's putting the money into the revolutions where's the money
[3:35:33.640 --> 3:35:40.200]  come row exactly wealthy people where did carl marx get his money did you know carl marx is
[3:35:40.200 --> 3:35:45.800]  like a big moocher literally he's just like a mooching dude yeah man like uh uh do i see
[3:35:45.800 --> 3:35:49.960]  your police tonight which is what he did like he just slept around at everybody else's house
[3:35:49.960 --> 3:35:59.720]  mooched on everybody and he had a benefactor angles wealthy stock owner angles david rockabiller puts
[3:35:59.720 --> 3:36:07.240]  money into liberal socialist causes for many many many decades this is this is old school so this is
[3:36:07.960 --> 3:36:14.200]  this is geopolitics 101 you will never get anywhere in understanding how the world really
[3:36:14.200 --> 3:36:21.240]  works if you don't get this one for this is number one level one okay you got to beat this boss
[3:36:21.240 --> 3:36:26.120]  before you go to level two if you don't get this you're an idiot you'll you'll never figure anything
[3:36:26.120 --> 3:36:34.440]  out nobody can have a revolution and overthrow a government without funding follow the money okay
[3:36:35.240 --> 3:36:41.240]  and all these people write books i actually went into the archives at my university i found
[3:36:41.880 --> 3:36:50.520]  warburg's private letters the the banker and he has letters about this and he says i am so pleased
[3:36:50.520 --> 3:36:58.680]  that my money was well spent in the russian revolution corporate collectivism
[3:37:01.160 --> 3:37:07.240]  of course a key figure comes into play in 1970s 1972 david rockabiller devotes a whole chapter
[3:37:07.240 --> 3:37:14.760]  to his protégé do you know who his protégé is why it's none other than zbigniew brzezinski now
[3:37:14.760 --> 3:37:19.560]  i've done multiple podcasts multiple lectures through the books of brzezinski but rockabiller
[3:37:19.560 --> 3:37:25.720]  devotes a whole section to him in 416 uh zbigniew brzezinski was my understudy and he's one of my
[3:37:25.720 --> 3:37:31.160]  greatest achievements i concocted this man out of nothing right so they recruited him out of
[3:37:31.160 --> 3:37:39.560]  colombia they put him in the at the head of uh the uh collateral commission in fact he mentions
[3:37:39.560 --> 3:37:46.760]  the key entities connected to zbig he says harvard colombia university workings institute
[3:37:46.760 --> 3:37:53.640]  board foundations we all had a a special place in our heart for zbig and he says i called up
[3:37:54.200 --> 3:38:03.160]  henry and i said henry where can we put zbig well mr rockabiller we have a steering committee that
[3:38:03.160 --> 3:38:08.200]  i will create just for zbig it will be called the trilateral commission that's literally what
[3:38:08.200 --> 3:38:14.360]  happened there's a whole chapter on it and people call this conspiracy theory that's a damn chapter
[3:38:14.360 --> 3:38:25.400]  in the book and he says zbig sat down and in 1974 we had this talk and trilateral would be devoted
[3:38:25.400 --> 3:38:39.560]  to quote a new world economic order new world economic order new world economic order slow
[3:38:39.560 --> 3:38:48.680]  boys did you hear that skeptics normies blue checkmarks did you hear that new world economic order
[3:38:51.640 --> 3:38:57.960]  zbig that's him that's what that was this that was right do you remember the remember the ad
[3:38:57.960 --> 3:39:04.280]  that i was i was used to run for uh truth rising and luke radowski confronts zbig
[3:39:04.280 --> 3:39:10.920]  and he asked him about 9 11 he asked him about the new world order do you remember zbig's response
[3:39:11.480 --> 3:39:17.960]  at that public event sit down and shut up not sit down sit down and shut up
[3:39:18.840 --> 3:39:23.640]  everything it starts with a z right this is zbig literally starts everything with z
[3:39:26.200 --> 3:39:29.960]  because it's all true it's all in his books it's all in david rockabiller's book
[3:39:29.960 --> 3:39:35.160]  and he even says if everybody has seen you know in game and alex's stuff over the years i'm sure
[3:39:35.160 --> 3:39:39.480]  everybody in this audience has seen if you haven't go watch in game very prophetic you know that there's
[3:39:39.480 --> 3:39:44.360]  a section i believe where it talks about jimmy carter being selected david rockabiller has a
[3:39:44.360 --> 3:39:50.200]  section where he says that yes we chose jimmy carter we thought he would be a key bilderberg
[3:39:50.200 --> 3:39:57.640]  president jimmy carlo right peanuts whatever that was before my time but he talks about bilderberg
[3:39:57.640 --> 3:40:04.440]  and opec and by the way that's in indol's book i think full spectrum dominance talks about that
[3:40:05.000 --> 3:40:13.320]  bilderberg actually engineered at the advice of enrique kissinger the whole 70s gas crisis
[3:40:15.560 --> 3:40:21.320]  so if you want earlier precedent for the kind of inflation crisis and whatnot that we're
[3:40:21.320 --> 3:40:25.480]  having right now everybody all the boomers talk about although i remember this back in the 70s
[3:40:25.480 --> 3:40:29.000]  this is just like the carter era with the gas and all that yeah because it's the same people
[3:40:29.000 --> 3:40:36.280]  doing the same things this is engineered and on page 417 he talks about opec and he talks about
[3:40:36.840 --> 3:40:42.920]  that being an engineered oil thing the oil shock 1974 opec in 1974 opec and the oil shock led everyone
[3:40:42.920 --> 3:40:52.040]  to call for a new international economic order and that's what we're going to talk about in
[3:40:52.040 --> 3:40:58.600]  for a new international economic order by the way did you see the new world economic forum
[3:40:58.600 --> 3:41:04.040]  i don't know if it's new but the the bug cookies eat the bugs not only are you going to eat the
[3:41:04.040 --> 3:41:10.680]  bugs the maggots the literal maggots there right i mean it's probably mealworms it's it's to me it
[3:41:10.680 --> 3:41:18.120]  looks like maggots right but uh the cookies don't those look ominous dude that looks like something
[3:41:18.120 --> 3:41:25.160]  from a freaking grim's fairy tale these are ground-ups the mealworms and the little ground-ups
[3:41:25.160 --> 3:41:32.520]  that maggots there will be some maggots cookies feed them to the plebs feed them to the bugs
[3:41:33.240 --> 3:41:38.840]  they think of us as bugs there's a quote in uh the authorised biography the rockfellers where
[3:41:38.840 --> 3:41:45.720]  rockfeller senior goes to india and he says i became convinced of the need for depopulation
[3:41:45.720 --> 3:41:51.960]  and when i went to india and he says i realized that people are just bugs that's what he says
[3:41:55.560 --> 3:42:01.080]  he says that we uh basically set up jimmy carter to be an anti-washington anti-establishment
[3:42:01.080 --> 3:42:06.360]  candidate but he was really just our guy right he was just kind of a cut out goober
[3:42:06.360 --> 3:42:15.800]  uh goober peanut man country man right he has the the face of uh that's disgusting he has the face
[3:42:15.800 --> 3:42:20.600]  of being this a man of the people's well jimmy carter the man of the people was just a vote for
[3:42:20.600 --> 3:42:29.960]  me because uh uh peanuts for farming and peanuts right and it was all a scam i mean he's talking
[3:42:29.960 --> 3:42:36.280]  about on page 417 with jimmy carter just being this cut out country boy somebody give a bullet
[3:42:36.280 --> 3:42:41.400]  saying that the president's a good old boy and then he talks about reagan we'll get a little
[3:42:41.400 --> 3:42:45.480]  bit into bill bergen reagan here in a moment because he there's some problems there they rockfeller
[3:42:45.480 --> 3:42:51.720]  admits that about reagan too this is the alex joneshaw your guest host j dire of j's analysis
[3:42:51.720 --> 3:42:57.480]  go check out my stuff at my website the internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan alex
[3:42:57.480 --> 3:43:02.200]  jones was right people ask what's it like to be vindicated well it's actually very sick feeling
[3:43:02.200 --> 3:43:08.600]  because i knew this was coming i tried to stop it and now everything i've talked about is going
[3:43:08.600 --> 3:43:14.360]  to become more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy
[3:43:14.360 --> 3:43:21.160]  reports and documents it's now out in the open claus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth
[3:43:21.160 --> 3:43:27.800]  the bill berg group founded davos group so now the fight's out in the open they're making their move
[3:43:27.800 --> 3:43:32.040]  because they know they're behind schedule we're going to win this thing god's watching the children
[3:43:32.040 --> 3:43:36.440]  counting on us i just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer
[3:43:36.440 --> 3:43:40.920]  and your financial support because without you info wars would not be here so i want you to really
[3:43:40.920 --> 3:43:46.040]  internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting
[3:43:46.040 --> 3:43:51.320]  chance so i want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[3:43:51.320 --> 3:43:58.520]  your efforts our world is so full of hype we are force-fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate
[3:43:58.520 --> 3:44:05.960]  media by the controlled churches and universities and why is this the case because we innately by god
[3:44:05.960 --> 3:44:11.640]  have been given the keys for our own minds our own societies our own souls and by connecting to god
[3:44:11.640 --> 3:44:19.960]  that we can empower ourselves and transcend the quote fallen or sinful state so the chemicals that we
[3:44:19.960 --> 3:44:26.600]  ingest and in all the things we try to bring into our bodies to change who we are we're only lowering
[3:44:26.600 --> 3:44:31.480]  us we're only making us more present from the end they're only making us less fulfilled it is only
[3:44:31.480 --> 3:44:36.760]  by going within and really making that connection to god that we can truly empower ourselves that's
[3:44:36.760 --> 3:44:41.720]  why the globe was bombardous with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins
[3:44:41.720 --> 3:44:47.720]  and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out
[3:44:47.720 --> 3:44:51.960]  beyond the third dimension and that's where the incredible products come in at infowarstore.com

[3:47:09.560 --> 3:47:12.680]  welcome back this is jim mccaught i'm just a humble little
[3:47:13.400 --> 3:47:19.640]  mule maggot farm i'm just a peanut farm did you ever watch blade runner 2049
[3:47:19.640 --> 3:47:25.320]  you remember at the beginning when ryan gozling flies out to the gigantic
[3:47:26.680 --> 3:47:33.000]  bug farms in la all of la is like a giant dystopian bug farm all over california basically
[3:47:34.120 --> 3:47:39.720]  la is the giant hellhole but if you remember there's no food and so
[3:47:41.640 --> 3:47:44.520]  vast swaths of land have been converted into
[3:47:44.520 --> 3:47:50.680]  to mule worm farms so everybody has to eat the bugs do you remember that now a lot of people
[3:47:50.680 --> 3:47:54.440]  didn't really like blade runner 2049 but there was some interesting elements in terms of the
[3:47:54.440 --> 3:47:58.920]  sort of predictive programming where you have everybody eating magnets and mealworms
[3:48:01.480 --> 3:48:06.040]  and david rocherfiller really just says you know jimmy carter was just kind of a created thing
[3:48:06.040 --> 3:48:11.800]  he was he was just a builder bird front character and then he says now you know rattle reagan when
[3:48:11.800 --> 3:48:17.240]  he was running um he said some things that we didn't actually like we did we weren't big fans of him
[3:48:18.120 --> 3:48:23.480]  calling out jimmy carter for being in the trilateral commission and he says that
[3:48:23.480 --> 3:48:30.440]  president reagan felt like this was not appropriate for a society based around the idea of representation
[3:48:30.440 --> 3:48:38.920]  and and the government by the people which is uh ultimately this was a funny quote here says
[3:48:38.920 --> 3:48:45.080]  however president reagan ultimately come to understand the importance of the trilateral
[3:48:45.080 --> 3:48:51.080]  commission's value i wonder what made him come to understand that i could you think of any event
[3:48:51.080 --> 3:48:56.360]  that might have had an influence on getting him to change his mind i mean there might be something
[3:48:56.360 --> 3:49:03.640]  out there i'll let you guys figure that one out and then a little interesting little tidbit which
[3:49:03.640 --> 3:49:09.880]  you've heard alex cover over the years he'll mention it here and there how did david rocherfiller
[3:49:09.880 --> 3:49:15.560]  do all this just because he was a rich dude like what just being rich i mean not not every rich
[3:49:15.560 --> 3:49:19.720]  person's able to do this well a lot of people don't know this about the rockfiller he says
[3:49:20.840 --> 3:49:28.120]  these organizations all reflect reflect my belief principle my belief in what he calls
[3:49:28.120 --> 3:49:34.920]  constructive engagement so here he is saying all these institutions that i've listed trilateral
[3:49:34.920 --> 3:49:43.320]  builder bird cfr blah blah blah blah he says they're not sinister forces they're just reflections
[3:49:43.320 --> 3:49:48.840]  of what i want to see in the world he says if you want to know how i learned to do this
[3:49:49.720 --> 3:49:56.840]  it was my time as an intelligence officer during world war two he says i you i learned to use all
[3:49:56.840 --> 3:50:04.840]  of my effectiveness which was dependent upon my ability to develop networks and larger networks
[3:50:04.840 --> 3:50:13.960]  of people with reliable information and powerful influence some might feel that i'm cynical and
[3:50:13.960 --> 3:50:20.280]  manipulative i disagree in fact i've built lasting friendships with all these people which is what
[3:50:20.280 --> 3:50:28.520]  allowed me to create my globalist networks he says i have a giant rolodex that i started
[3:50:29.240 --> 3:50:35.640]  in the 40s let's go to have a giant rolodex and that's what i do is just have all my network
[3:50:35.640 --> 3:50:42.760]  contacts and i learned how to do all this from my intelligence training espionage training
[3:50:42.760 --> 3:50:50.440]  and he ends the chapter by saying uh if people want to call me an internationalist ready to
[3:50:50.440 --> 3:50:56.360]  create a new world order go ahead because that is what i'm after interesting admissions there from
[3:50:57.480 --> 3:51:03.240]  pretty high up near the apex of the pyramid maybe not the maybe not the tip top maybe not the eye
[3:51:03.960 --> 3:51:10.600]  the eye of the pyramid might be an spiritual entity all right but you know sort of those little
[3:51:10.600 --> 3:51:16.040]  bricks up near the top sort of underneath the eye of the pyramid somebody like the rockfiller i think
[3:51:16.040 --> 3:51:22.120]  clearly we could and we can see that by open admissions in the book and again that that chapter
[3:51:22.120 --> 3:51:27.640]  is so important because it's about the bill berger it's about the history of this international
[3:51:27.640 --> 3:51:34.440]  steering committee which does have a lot of power because again remember this is people who are all
[3:51:34.440 --> 3:51:40.840]  over ceo's all over the fortune 100 all through government so public and private sector people
[3:51:42.200 --> 3:51:49.000]  and there's a great poster that kind of illustrates the gigantic printout poster which has
[3:51:49.800 --> 3:51:54.520]  people who are in the bill berger group people who are in the trial lateral commission people
[3:51:54.520 --> 3:52:01.800]  who are in the cfr and the media they're all part of the same groups so i would call that
[3:52:01.800 --> 3:52:10.040]  racketeering and coordination conspiring espionage theory you want to call it that i mean didn't
[3:52:10.040 --> 3:52:14.120]  david rockfiller just say that i learned all the tech techniques because i was trained in espionage
[3:52:14.840 --> 3:52:19.400]  so you don't want to use the word conspiracy if that hurts your feelings just replace it with
[3:52:19.400 --> 3:52:23.560]  the word espionage and that's exactly what david rockfiller says the end of the chapter and it
[3:52:23.560 --> 3:52:31.080]  was a trained in spy work and that's how i did all this no matter where you look the key to the
[3:52:31.080 --> 3:52:36.360]  control according to daniel esselin is the secrecy that bill berg was concerned with for many many
[3:52:36.360 --> 3:52:41.080]  decades they're not so concerned about that anymore it's kind of well known everybody's
[3:52:41.080 --> 3:52:44.760]  heard about bill berg group they're not so concerned with this being a secret thing they
[3:52:44.760 --> 3:52:50.520]  kind of pass the torch on to the silicon valley tech people and the in the darpa people which was
[3:52:51.080 --> 3:52:55.320]  four or five bill berg's back right they had made that kind of public the key to this control is
[3:52:55.320 --> 3:53:03.320]  secrecy esselin says the meetings of the organization for economic cooperation oecd and development g8
[3:53:03.320 --> 3:53:13.240]  wto world economic forum central banks european union u commission u summits u cabinet meetings
[3:53:13.960 --> 3:53:20.440]  are all people who attend and interact and steer through bill berg
[3:53:20.440 --> 3:53:29.960]  esselin goes on to say that if you want to understand their modus operandi or their ideology
[3:53:31.320 --> 3:53:38.920]  it is really a covert way something akin to a kind of fabian socialist model he says
[3:53:39.560 --> 3:53:44.680]  which can include people who are not socialists who are not fabians who are not fascists or whatever
[3:53:44.680 --> 3:53:48.840]  they that you can have any of the views you want because it's not about those things they're all
[3:53:48.840 --> 3:53:55.560]  modeled on shadow government covert government approaches steering committee approaches what
[3:53:55.560 --> 3:54:00.280]  you might call the deep state and the deep state is not just in america it's an international
[3:54:00.280 --> 3:54:07.880]  clique david rockeville's words are proud internationalists and as we get into the
[3:54:07.880 --> 3:54:12.440]  chapters of the history one of the things that occurred to me i covered this i think uh six
[3:54:12.440 --> 3:54:16.600]  months ago right if you guys remember we did a whole fourth hour on bill berg and all that
[3:54:16.600 --> 3:54:22.920]  uh and i don't need to rehearse all that because you can go watch that but just to remind everybody
[3:54:23.480 --> 3:54:30.600]  back when esselin's book came out the famous bill berg group i think his book came out in 2006 or
[3:54:30.600 --> 3:54:40.680]  seven um he had been to bill berg either 2005 or 2007 one of the two and at that point back then
