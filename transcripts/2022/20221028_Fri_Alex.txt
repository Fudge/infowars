[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.174]  This is the time for the people to come together, whether they're conservative, whether they're liberal, whether they're Christian, whether they're Muslim or Buddhist or agnostic.
[00:00:07.594 --> 00:00:13.778]  If you like living and you don't want to enter, bare minimum, a new dark age, then we need to stop this right now.
[00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.301]  A limited war will cause a total financial collapse, which they're already engaged in.
[00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:20.403]  They want to blame the collapse on the nuclear war.
[00:00:21.023 --> 00:00:26.527]  A strategic war will lead to massive fallout, nuclear reactors melting down and exploding, at least in Europe.
[00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:28.288]  And we're talking Chernobyl.
[00:00:28.908 --> 00:00:35.207]   We're talking other major meltdowns like we saw a few years ago in Japan, times 10, times 100.
[00:00:35.207 --> 00:00:41.517]   And then the statistics and the research shows that a strategic war will probably lead to a full-on strategic
[00:00:41.517 --> 00:00:43.908]  nuclear war on a planetary scale.
[00:00:43.908 --> 00:00:48.908]   That's why we have to be so concerned and so engaged and so involved.
[00:00:48.908 --> 00:00:50.908]  People should be on the streets peacefully demonstrating.
[00:00:50.908 --> 00:00:52.908]  People should be at churches speaking about this.
[00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:55.100]  People should be going to their city councils.
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.403]  Anywhere you can find a microphone and an audience.
[00:00:57.423 --> 00:01:04.612]  This is the number one central issue that the globalists always planned on a nuclear war with Russia to bring in their world government.
[00:01:04.632 --> 00:01:06.133]  They've got their deep underground bases.
[00:01:06.414 --> 00:01:07.635]  They've got their system set up.
[00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:16.501]  They've got their programs prepared, and they believe that they can come out of this limited nuclear war and establish their technocracy and their new world order.
[00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:22.565]  They were unable to get it with their poison shots and their virus hysteria, so now they're moving on to phase two of the war.
[00:01:22.384 --> 00:01:43.943]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, October 28th, 2022.
[00:01:43.943 --> 00:01:51.464]   And the doomsday clock just ticked several minutes closer to midnight.
[00:01:52.212 --> 00:02:04.959]   In a stunning strategy reversal, Pentagon will no longer rule out use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear threats, reversing previous U.S.
[00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.000]  policy going back into the early 1960s.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:20.824]  The Pentagon now says, and President Biden now says, they will preemptively use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear threats or conventional armies.
[00:02:21.604 --> 00:02:36.570]  This was done on the heels, as has been reported today by Bloomberg, after Putin came out yesterday and said that we have no political-military reasoning in a nuke strike in Ukraine and are not planning to use nuclear weapons preemptively.
[00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.672]  And so the establishment responds here in the West by saying, oh really?
[00:02:42.272 --> 00:02:47.274]  Well, we will preemptively use nuclear weapons against you.
[00:02:48.447 --> 00:02:57.996]  The globalists are setting the stage for a limited, if not strategic, planetary war with nuclear weapons that will end civilization as we know it.
[00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:01.619]  I've walked through many times what will happen during even a limited nuclear war.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.201]  It'll crash the economies.
[00:03:03.541 --> 00:03:06.804]  It'll create absolute panic, which is part of the Great Reset Plan.
[00:03:07.285 --> 00:03:15.118]   Most analysis and most breakdowns by different think tanks and military industrial complex
[00:03:15.118 --> 00:03:21.588]   systems, believe that a limited strike has a more than 50% chance of
[00:03:21.588 --> 00:03:26.747]   leading to a theater war, meaning in the region, Europe, and that that would then
[00:03:26.747 --> 00:03:29.587]  lead to a full-on strategic nuclear war.
[00:03:29.811 --> 00:03:31.371]  This has been wargamed in Europe heavily.
[00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:33.972]  It's been wargamed also in the South China Sea.
[00:03:34.032 --> 00:03:43.273]  It's been wargamed between India and Pakistan, which most analysts until recently thought was the number one main vector site that could kick this war off.
[00:03:43.373 --> 00:03:46.374]  Now it's no longer India-Pakistan, India-China.
[00:03:46.934 --> 00:03:53.762]   It is now The Ukraine proxy war that is now a de facto war between the West and Russia.
[00:03:53.782 --> 00:03:57.884]  We're going to be laying more of this out today on this special Friday broadcast.
[00:03:58.525 --> 00:04:06.389]  There's a lot of other interesting news like Elon Musk taking over Twitter and all the freaking out there and the midterms, you know, less than two weeks away.
[00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.331]  All of it is incredibly important.
[00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:27.698]  But, centrally, is the issue of the globalist mouthpieces and the globalist media pushing nuclear war like it's a good idea, pushing nuclear war like it's survivable, pushing nuclear war like it's no big deal, and now the Pentagon coming out and saying, we'll strike preemptively non-nuclear threats.
[00:04:28.378 --> 00:04:31.439]  On a scale of 1 to 10 of insanity, this is a 9.
[00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:33.040]  A 10 is launching the weapons.
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:50.914]   This is the globalist taking the safety, Off the gun, it's now loaded, their fingers on the trigger, and when you look at the poison injections and the devaluation of currencies, the open borders, it's all part of the Great Reset strategy to destabilize the entire world.
[00:04:52.096 --> 00:04:59.181]  This is the time for the people to come together, whether they're conservative, whether they're liberal, whether they're Christian, whether they're Muslim or Buddhist or agnostic.
[00:04:59.601 --> 00:05:05.785]  If you like living and you don't want to enter, bare minimum, a new dark age, then we need to stop this right now.
[00:05:06.426 --> 00:05:10.308]  A limited war will cause a total financial collapse, which they're already engaged in.
[00:05:10.328 --> 00:05:12.410]  They want to blame the collapse on the nuclear war.
[00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.632]  A strategic war will lead to massive fallout.
[00:05:15.652 --> 00:05:18.534]  Nuclear reactors melting down and exploding, at least in Europe.
[00:05:18.934 --> 00:05:20.295]  And we're talking Chernobyl.
[00:05:20.915 --> 00:05:45.346]   We're talking Other major meltdowns like we saw a few years ago in Japan times ten times a hundred and then the statistics and the research shows That a strategic war will probably lead to a full-on strategic nuclear war on a planetary scale That's why we have to be so concerned and so engaged and so involved people should be on the streets peacefully demonstrating people should be at churches speaking about this and
[00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:47.107]  People should be going to their city councils.
[00:05:47.227 --> 00:05:49.408]  Anywhere you can find a microphone and an audience.
[00:05:49.428 --> 00:05:56.613]  This is the number one central issue that the globalists always planned on a nuclear war with Russia to bring in their world government.
[00:05:56.633 --> 00:05:58.134]  They've got their deep underground bases.
[00:05:58.394 --> 00:05:59.655]  They've got their systems set up.
[00:06:00.475 --> 00:06:01.796]  They've got their programs prepared.
[00:06:02.657 --> 00:06:08.521]  And they believe that they can come out of this limited nuclear war and establish their technocracy and their new world order.
[00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:11.763]  They were unable to get it with their poison shots and their virus hysteria.
[00:06:12.543 --> 00:06:14.565]  So now they're moving on to phase two, the war.
[00:06:15.085 --> 00:06:16.907]  Thank you for joining us on this live Friday edition.
[00:06:17.327 --> 00:06:18.488]  Owen Schroeder and others are coming up.
[00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:20.550]  We'll be following other special reports throughout the broadcast.
[00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:23.873]  Please share the live links like your life depends on it, because it does.
[00:06:24.914 --> 00:06:25.775]  God bless and good luck.
[00:06:27.196 --> 00:06:33.482]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, October 28, 2022.
[00:06:33.642 --> 00:06:49.175]   And I got to tell you, there are just It's like a game of whack-a-mole, except all the moles are up out of their hole at the same time, and we've got to find a way to hammer each one with the mallet.
[00:06:49.635 --> 00:06:56.959]  And that's what we're going to be doing here today on the Alex Jones Show with myself, Alex Jones, and special guests coming up as well.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:05.985]  Before I lay out what's coming up with the news coverage today, because I've got three or four stacks of extremely important news.
[00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:20.821]  There's an energy that I haven't felt in a while right now in America and you may be feeling it and experiencing it yourself and it's an energy we haven't felt in years.
[00:07:22.022 --> 00:07:41.144]   It's an energy of victory, it's an energy of free speech, it's an energy of hopefulness and really The midterms coming up in 11 days is going to be either the lid put back on that energy or the lid blown off of that energy.
[00:07:43.064 --> 00:08:00.172]  And we move forward with the best Congress in modern day history if we can get some of these great patriots in, like a Blake Masters, like a Herschel Walker, and so many more.
[00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:05.593]  Just expanding to the few great patriots that we have in Congress right now in the Republican Party.
[00:08:06.093 --> 00:08:12.598]  And then it'll add more fuel to the flame of liberty that burns within the Republican Party.
[00:08:12.618 --> 00:08:14.359]  It's completely snuffed out of the Democrat Party.
[00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:16.301]  That's why people like Tulsi Gabbard and others have left.
[00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:24.808]  And it will make them more emboldened to do what is right, to save this country and speak the truth.
[00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:34.679]  And move America forward in a way that brings it prosperity and independence for the people.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.761]  The complete opposite of globalism.
[00:08:37.801 --> 00:08:39.683]  The complete opposite of liberalism.
[00:08:40.323 --> 00:08:43.966]  The complete opposite of the direction that we have been going.
[00:08:44.206 --> 00:09:07.081]   And a lot of that has to do with obviously the midterms, but I'll also With Elon Musk officially closing the Twitter deal yesterday, and then with such viral tweets getting a million likes plus, like, the bird is free.
[00:09:09.502 --> 00:09:17.325]  Also, replying to others on Twitter asking for accounts to be unbanned, saying we're going to be digging into that today.
[00:09:19.397 --> 00:09:26.018]  Now, as far as... I mean, this has to be one of the most popular tweets of all time.
[00:09:27.158 --> 00:09:28.419]  The bird is freed.
[00:09:28.539 --> 00:09:34.240]  Elon Musk, 1.6 million likes.
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.720]  264,000 retweets.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.640]  Not even up 24 hours yet.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.561]  That's gotta be one of the most popular of all time.
[00:09:41.021 --> 00:09:43.181]  I don't know what the list there is, but that's gotta be up there.
[00:09:45.482 --> 00:09:47.222]  We might have free speech again on Twitter.
[00:09:48.743 --> 00:09:52.626]  And so I've obviously got a stack of news on that.
[00:09:54.047 --> 00:10:22.333]   I've got a big stack of news over here with some major developments leading up to the midterms, but the trend continues where liberals and leftists, and this is the genuinely anti-establishment liberal left that may not see eye to eye with you or I politically, but They don't like wars and, generally speaking, they're anti-establishment.
[00:10:25.036 --> 00:10:41.269]  And so, when you have AOC and Pelosi and now Ilhan Omar and all these other people getting protested at their own event by leftists for supporting war, Elizabeth Warren, so many others, that's a good sign.
[00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:56.054]  And I think a lot of that has to do with the boldness and the bravery of Tulsi Gabbard coming out, who's always been anti-war, and saying, I can't be a part of this Democrat Party anymore.
[00:10:56.134 --> 00:11:16.330]   They're pro-war, they're pro-censorship, they're anti-American, and that has given Other leftists, other liberals, the courage to go to these Democrat events and shout down their representatives saying, we don't want World War III, you ran on anti-war, why are you now getting us into World War III with Russia?
[00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:17.591]  What the hell is wrong with you?
[00:11:17.631 --> 00:11:19.833]  So we've got more examples of that.
[00:11:21.875 --> 00:11:25.718]  There is a huge development, and I didn't even get to this yesterday.
[00:11:27.077 --> 00:11:29.218]  And I'm hoping I'll have time to get to it today.
[00:11:29.378 --> 00:12:03.813]   There is a huge development on a January 6th defendant that may be the greatest new evidence, I mean aside from Ray Epps, Aside from all the Antifa people going into the Capitol first that we have on footage and Ray Epps calling people to go in and then the January 6th committee says they don't know who he is and the FBI takes him off the most wanted list as if that wasn't proof enough that there was fed involvement.
[00:12:04.793 --> 00:12:29.464]   I think that this story of a January 6th defendant might be the most subtle yet obvious proof Specifically when you give it a side-by-side comparison with the fake kidnapping of Gretchen Whitmer case and the attempt to launch a similar situation in Virginia when Ralph Northam was the governor there.
[00:12:30.024 --> 00:12:33.806]  So I'll explain that coming up as well.
[00:12:36.104 --> 00:12:41.346]  We've got a Alex Jones prediction almost 14 years ago to the day.
[00:12:42.026 --> 00:12:43.947]  We'll go back to October 30th, 2008.
[00:12:44.007 --> 00:12:49.368]  This is in regards to the Deep State wanting a war with Russia now.
[00:12:49.709 --> 00:12:51.009]  Making that clearer than ever.
[00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.070]  Putting all of our lives in danger, quite frankly.
[00:12:55.771 --> 00:12:58.572]  The Pentagon and the White House right now.
[00:13:00.792 --> 00:13:29.070]   Saber rattling to try to get a war with Russia going and we're not in a good position As far as geopolitically is concerned, because we're no longer self-sustainable, we're no longer independent, we are a dependent nation on foreign nations, we've shut off our own energy, so we don't even have energy, Biden has drained the strategic oil reserves, so that's a problem too, and then you see the rest of the world power structure backing Russia.
[00:13:30.194 --> 00:13:44.766]  And then you see who would supposedly be our allies in such a situation, the NATO allies and the European countries pretty much balking and telling the US, yeah, you want war with Russia over Ukraine, you're actually in it alone.
[00:13:45.126 --> 00:13:48.649]  Because, remember, Ukraine is not a NATO country.
[00:13:50.270 --> 00:14:03.280]   So despite all the propaganda trying to sell it like the West has some sort of Loyalty or duty to protect Ukraine, they don't.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.021]  European countries don't and NATO countries don't.
[00:14:07.901 --> 00:14:08.301]  They don't.
[00:14:10.062 --> 00:14:11.362]  And the only reason why the U.S.
[00:14:11.382 --> 00:14:28.266]  has that loyalty is because of people like Nancy Pelosi and the Biden crime family that have their business deals there where they send a hundred million, excuse me, a hundred billion dollars to Ukraine and then where does the money go?
[00:14:30.794 --> 00:14:35.318]  Nobody seems to know, and nobody seems to want to know.
[00:14:36.579 --> 00:14:43.644]  So, that is what's coming up on today's transmission, plus we'll be hearing from Alex along the way as well.
[00:14:44.205 --> 00:14:48.528]  But ladies and gentlemen, despite all the censorship, we're still here on air.
[00:14:48.708 --> 00:14:50.530]  And so that's the good news.
[00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.432]  They did not expect for InfoWars to still be on air.
[00:14:53.532 --> 00:14:56.334]  They did not expect Alex Jones to still have a voice.
[00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:59.737]   They did not expect you To still have a voice.
[00:14:59.937 --> 00:15:07.181]  Yet, here we are, ready for another three-hour transmission, four-hour Alex Jones Show, and then I'll be also hosting the War Room later today.
[00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:09.923]  And that's thanks to your support at InfoWarStore.com.

[00:15:52.687 --> 00:15:54.629]  That only has one day left.
[00:15:54.649 --> 00:15:57.612]  So final day for big sales at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:15:58.427 --> 00:16:06.490]  All right, I want to get into this stack of political news as we are 11 days out from the midterm elections.
[00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:10.892]  Such a key election coming up here in 11 days.
[00:16:10.912 --> 00:16:12.033]  Hard to believe we're that close.
[00:16:13.593 --> 00:16:17.795]  The whole world, the whole process is so crazy now that you're actually near the finish line.
[00:16:17.815 --> 00:16:18.916]  You're like, whoa, here we are.
[00:16:20.056 --> 00:16:26.559]  Now, there's some oddities in the financial news sector here today.
[00:16:27.708 --> 00:16:39.538]  That I try to understand and it just really, the best way to describe it is that again, you're being lied to by the White House, you're being lied to by the American media.
[00:16:40.518 --> 00:16:42.860]  And so this was a big story all week long.
[00:16:43.481 --> 00:16:48.525]  Shell and Total Oil Giants Report Huge Profits on High Energy Prices.
[00:16:49.526 --> 00:16:59.380]   And so this was the big talking point is, oh look, the oil companies are making more money than ever before and They're trying to blame the oil companies.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.180]  Well, okay.
[00:17:01.801 --> 00:17:03.841]  But it's not even American oil companies.
[00:17:04.261 --> 00:17:05.782]  It's European oil companies.
[00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:14.025]  And so they're trying to say that this is an American oil problem, and then they're covering European oil companies.
[00:17:15.565 --> 00:17:16.326]  So they say, see?
[00:17:17.166 --> 00:17:19.327]  Look at how corrupt the American oil!
[00:17:19.367 --> 00:17:21.027]  Look at how bad big oil is!
[00:17:21.107 --> 00:17:22.028]  Look at what they do!
[00:17:22.128 --> 00:17:23.788]  And then you say, well, what are they talking about?
[00:17:23.868 --> 00:17:24.989]  Oh, European oil companies?
[00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.289]  Wait, what?
[00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:29.840]  So what do you want Biden to do to European oil companies, liberals?
[00:17:31.141 --> 00:17:32.421]  I'm just curious, but okay.
[00:17:34.822 --> 00:17:37.803]  Oil companies making a record profit, maybe you got a problem with that.
[00:17:39.544 --> 00:17:48.908]  Okay, so what happens when corporations, what happens when big businesses, what happens when they make a lot of money?
[00:17:49.895 --> 00:17:54.096]  Well, your GDP goes up, you see, because they're selling more products.
[00:17:55.057 --> 00:18:11.082]  So they complain that the oil companies are making more money than ever before, but then they celebrate that the White House is claiming that there has been a 2.6% GDP growth in the third quarter.
[00:18:11.142 --> 00:18:16.163]  So, big corporations, big oil, making record profits, bad.
[00:18:16.983 --> 00:18:18.804]  GDP going up, good.
[00:18:21.428 --> 00:18:24.909]  Those two things are not consistent, obviously.
[00:18:25.649 --> 00:18:34.291]  But again, we're talking about liberals, we're talking about Democrats, so consistency's not a concern of theirs, only the party propaganda.
[00:18:35.111 --> 00:18:40.333]  So again, oh, oil companies making a lot of money, big business making a lot of money, bad.
[00:18:41.193 --> 00:18:45.834]  Oh, GDP up when a Democrat's in the office, good, good, yes, good!
[00:18:47.452 --> 00:18:48.572]  Business is making a lot of money!
[00:18:48.732 --> 00:18:49.193]  Bad!
[00:18:49.273 --> 00:18:49.653]  Bad!
[00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:50.353]  Yes, bad!
[00:18:50.433 --> 00:18:50.753]  Boo!
[00:18:50.793 --> 00:18:52.073]  We don't like business making money!
[00:18:52.133 --> 00:18:52.674]  No good!
[00:18:53.494 --> 00:18:53.614]  Ooh!
[00:18:54.014 --> 00:18:54.274]  Ooh!
[00:18:54.354 --> 00:18:55.094]  GDP up!
[00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:55.815]  GDP up!
[00:18:55.875 --> 00:18:56.215]  Good!
[00:18:56.415 --> 00:18:56.655]  Yes!
[00:18:56.715 --> 00:18:57.375]  Thank you, Biden!
[00:18:57.495 --> 00:18:57.755]  Yes!
[00:18:57.815 --> 00:18:58.615]  GDP good!
[00:18:58.635 --> 00:19:01.376]  These are not bright people.
[00:19:02.897 --> 00:19:07.298]  But some aren't believing the 2.6 GDP number.
[00:19:08.759 --> 00:19:09.899]  Like Wall Street Silver.
[00:19:11.175 --> 00:19:18.500]  Can't help but notice those Amazon earnings don't explicitly jibe with the whole 2.6 economic growth thing.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:26.645]  How the heck is GDP up 2.6% when these numbers, with these numbers from Amazon, is GDP data fake right before the election?
[00:19:26.705 --> 00:19:30.807]  Well, I wouldn't be surprised if they faked data before the election.
[00:19:34.169 --> 00:19:39.372]  I mean, the GDP, we were already in a recession, technically speaking.
[00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:46.699]  So going up 2.6% is still not even getting it back to where it needed to be.
[00:19:46.779 --> 00:19:48.340]  So you're still technically in the red.
[00:19:48.881 --> 00:19:54.226]  If you're looking at from a percentage growth standpoint under the Biden administration, you're still in the red.
[00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:56.228]  But see, here's what they do.
[00:19:58.069 --> 00:20:02.734]  They tell this big lie, just like the Biden White House did with the gas prices.
[00:20:03.274 --> 00:20:05.817]  This is Joe Biden yesterday.
[00:20:07.148 --> 00:20:09.349]  So okay, they say, look how great we are.
[00:20:09.469 --> 00:20:10.749]  GDP growth up 2.6%.
[00:20:11.989 --> 00:20:16.971]  But if you look at the overall number since Biden got in the White House, it's still down.
[00:20:18.131 --> 00:20:22.073]  We'd actually still be considered in a recession if it wasn't for this most recent number.
[00:20:22.513 --> 00:20:24.573]  So maybe they faked it to say we're not in a recession.
[00:20:24.973 --> 00:20:25.754]  Maybe it's legit.
[00:20:26.734 --> 00:20:30.015]  But either way, they're lying by saying, look at how good we've done with the GDP.
[00:20:30.055 --> 00:20:32.256]  This is the same thing they're doing with gas prices now.
[00:20:34.076 --> 00:20:36.557]  Here's Joe Biden yesterday.
[00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:46.767]  Taking a victory lap on lowering gas prices in clip F. The most common price of gas in America is $3.39.
[00:20:49.169 --> 00:20:51.431]  Down from over $5 when I took office.
[00:20:52.772 --> 00:20:55.755]  So, that is as big of a lie as you can make.
[00:20:56.816 --> 00:20:57.897]  Water is not wet.
[00:20:58.117 --> 00:20:59.998]  The sun doesn't rise in the east.
[00:21:00.339 --> 00:21:02.721]  I mean, you know, whatever you want to say.
[00:21:05.683 --> 00:21:14.090]  We all know that the average price per gallon in the United States when Biden took office was $2.39 a gallon.
[00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:18.253]  This is easily available data.
[00:21:18.774 --> 00:21:29.002]  So, gas when Biden took office was $2.39 per gallon, but here's what Joe Biden lies and tells you gas was.
[00:21:29.082 --> 00:21:29.763]  Again, here it is.
[00:21:29.803 --> 00:21:30.764]  Play the clip one more time.
[00:21:31.189 --> 00:21:34.150]  The most common price of gas in America is $3.39.
[00:21:36.531 --> 00:21:38.811]  Down from over $5 when I took office.
[00:21:39.832 --> 00:21:43.693]  So, gas got up to $5 after Joe Biden took office.
[00:21:43.733 --> 00:21:45.754]  He doubled the gas prices.
[00:21:45.794 --> 00:21:46.774]  More than doubled, actually.
[00:21:47.114 --> 00:21:47.774]  More than doubled.
[00:21:49.175 --> 00:21:50.215]  More than doubled.
[00:21:51.318 --> 00:21:56.039]  Even Twitter, which I guess we can't even say even Twitter now since it's owned by Elon Musk.
[00:21:56.799 --> 00:22:00.720]  But even Twitter has a fact check on this saying Biden's lying.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.961]  It was $2.38 a gallon when he took office.
[00:22:05.301 --> 00:22:06.161]  He said it was five.
[00:22:07.082 --> 00:22:09.762]  So he lies to you and the media is not going to call him on it.
[00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:13.523]  And he assumes that you're so stupid you're going to believe his lie.
[00:22:13.923 --> 00:22:16.144]  Or really he doesn't even know what's going on actually.
[00:22:16.224 --> 00:22:17.544]  Biden doesn't even know where he is half the time.
[00:22:18.706 --> 00:22:20.567]  So, oh, $5 when I took office.
[00:22:20.607 --> 00:22:22.368]  Look, I lowered the gas to $3.39.
[00:22:22.608 --> 00:22:27.950]  That's actually a dollar higher than it was when you took office, you jackass.
[00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.091]  So now they're doing the same thing with the GDP.
[00:22:31.431 --> 00:22:35.393]  And they're saying, look, GDP is up 2.6%.
[00:22:36.253 --> 00:22:37.334]  Thank you, Joe Biden.
[00:22:37.754 --> 00:22:45.097]  No, we just had three quarters of negative GDP growth, which means we're in a recession.
[00:22:46.471 --> 00:22:54.077]  And we're still in the red under Joe Biden, and he says, look, we've gained 2.6% GDP growth, which is still in the red.
[00:22:54.558 --> 00:22:57.881]  Oh, look, gas is down from $5 a gallon when I took office.
[00:22:57.961 --> 00:23:02.424]  No, gas is up a dollar from $2.39 a gallon when you took office.
[00:23:02.745 --> 00:23:03.545]  You liar.
[00:23:04.006 --> 00:23:05.227]  So it's the same thing with GDP.
[00:23:05.507 --> 00:23:07.168]  Oh, GDP up 2.6%.
[00:23:07.709 --> 00:23:12.253]  No, GDP is actually down about 4% since you took office.
[00:23:12.433 --> 00:23:13.514]  You liar.
[00:23:15.911 --> 00:23:20.313]  But, you know, maybe crashing the economy isn't your thing.
[00:23:20.693 --> 00:23:21.673]  Maybe it's war.
[00:23:21.693 --> 00:23:23.254]  Maybe that's what you like.
[00:23:23.934 --> 00:23:40.340]  By the way, before I hit these war clips, in fact, I'll cover the news with the war on the other side, but here's Alex Jones on October 30th, 2008, almost 12 years ago to the day predicting a nuclear war with Russia in this clip.
[00:23:41.334 --> 00:23:44.918]  They want a major war with an influential world power.
[00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:45.880]  Mad men!
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.762]  I mean, what does it ever end?
[00:23:48.203 --> 00:23:49.945]  They're publicly stealing all the money.
[00:23:49.965 --> 00:23:51.708]  They're trying to start World War III.
[00:23:52.529 --> 00:23:54.772]  They snuck attack Russia a month and a half ago.
[00:23:54.952 --> 00:23:55.533]  They got 10,000 nukes.
[00:23:55.593 --> 00:23:55.873]  Topolims.
[00:23:58.627 --> 00:24:03.588]  And they're openly, NATO's announced that they have a preemptive strike that they may sneak attack Russia.
[00:24:03.608 --> 00:24:10.590]  And then Russia comes out and says, well, we're going to defend ourselves and the media spins that and says Russia's threatening to blow the US to kingdom come.
[00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.811]  That's why the Russians are moving back into Cuba.
[00:24:13.051 --> 00:24:14.151]  They're moving into Venezuela.
[00:24:14.171 --> 00:24:15.731]  They've moved nukes into Venezuela.
[00:24:15.931 --> 00:24:17.092]  They're in the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:24:17.292 --> 00:24:26.214]  Rand and the Carlyle Group are not amused at the fact that the stock market is crashing and they want a new war to reinvigorate it.
[00:24:27.472 --> 00:24:31.694]  I mean, that's evil enough, but why can't they pick Venezuela or something?
[00:24:31.894 --> 00:24:33.594]  Why does it have to be Russia and China?
[00:24:34.495 --> 00:24:37.436]  And now, here we are, once again, Alex Jones ahead of his time.
[00:24:38.036 --> 00:24:41.977]  So, nobody wants world war.
[00:24:42.418 --> 00:24:44.298]  You would think nobody wants nuclear war.
[00:24:45.539 --> 00:24:53.662]  That is, unless you want to see civilization destroyed, you want to see the planet destroyed, and then you think you can take over upon its ashes.
[00:24:55.458 --> 00:24:58.982]  Seems to be what our deep state and White House are into right now.
[00:24:59.622 --> 00:25:03.666]  US accelerates plan to deploy upgraded nukes to Europe.
[00:25:04.888 --> 00:25:05.368]  That's nice.
[00:25:05.408 --> 00:25:09.212]  Let's just move a bunch of nukes around the planet and threaten nuclear war.
[00:25:09.272 --> 00:25:10.293]  That's what the people want.
[00:25:11.394 --> 00:25:17.481]  You'd think we'd be beyond that by now as humans in the information age, in the digital age, in the globalized age, but no.
[00:25:19.051 --> 00:25:21.173]  No, our governments still want to blow people up.
[00:25:21.954 --> 00:25:28.661]  In stunning strategy reversal, Pentagon will no longer rule out use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear threats.
[00:25:29.722 --> 00:25:38.311]  So Russia comes out and says, we don't want to use nukes and we will not preemptively use nukes.
[00:25:40.518 --> 00:25:41.999]  Again, where are the peace talks?
[00:25:42.039 --> 00:25:42.799]  Where are the summits?
[00:25:43.119 --> 00:25:45.280]  Where are the leaders sitting down?
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.841]  Russia has said they would sit down in Zelensky for peace talks.
[00:25:49.221 --> 00:25:50.242]  Zelensky said, F you.
[00:25:50.682 --> 00:25:54.903]  Elon Musk said he would help usher in peace talks with Russia and Ukraine.
[00:25:55.023 --> 00:25:56.264]  Zelensky said, F you.
[00:25:57.624 --> 00:25:58.725]  And then that story goes on.
[00:25:59.705 --> 00:26:02.386]  And so Russia says, we're not going to use nukes preemptively.
[00:26:02.426 --> 00:26:03.746]  So what is the US's response?
[00:26:03.605 --> 00:26:05.605]  Well, we will!
[00:26:05.605 --> 00:26:07.605]  Wow.
[00:26:07.605 --> 00:26:15.605]   So, I mean, you could say this is a moment of Russia lowering its guard, putting its guard down.
[00:26:16.494 --> 00:26:32.847]  This is a moment of Russia saying, look, we know we're not having peace talks, but here's our public statement saying we won't use nukes preemptively as a sign to the world that we don't want nuclear war.
[00:26:33.817 --> 00:26:38.098]  They haven't made their agenda in Ukraine secret, but they're saying we don't want nuclear war.
[00:26:38.418 --> 00:26:39.078]  So the U.S.
[00:26:39.118 --> 00:26:51.541]  instead of saying this is an opportunity to lower the temperature in the room, this is an opportunity to maybe help avoid a nuclear confrontation or larger escalation of war, and instead the U.S.
[00:26:51.581 --> 00:26:56.222]  says no, this is an opportunity for us to look at Russia as weak and threaten them with nukes.
[00:26:57.962 --> 00:27:02.203]  Incredible stuff from our evil, satanic government.
[00:27:03.905 --> 00:27:05.387]  The White House and the Pentagon.
[00:27:05.467 --> 00:27:06.769]  Sick, sick stuff.
[00:27:08.572 --> 00:27:11.617]  But the average liberal Democrat voter doesn't want war either.
[00:27:13.154 --> 00:27:18.037]  They have a self-preservation mechanism not to get into a nuclear war.
[00:27:18.517 --> 00:27:24.621]  Despite the overwhelming propaganda in the media that would have you believe most liberals want war, that's not true.
[00:27:24.881 --> 00:27:30.805]  There are obviously the radical left that will just support any state propaganda that's shoved down their throats at this point.
[00:27:30.845 --> 00:27:32.887]  They're in total brainwashing Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:27:33.367 --> 00:27:35.008]  We can't really help them anymore.
[00:27:35.348 --> 00:27:35.888]  They're gone.
[00:27:36.869 --> 00:27:42.934]  But no, the average liberal, the average liberal Democrat that can still think for themselves doesn't want war.
[00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:54.742]  And so now you've had Cortez, you've had Elizabeth Warren, and all of these other liberal Democrats in Congress have their events get shut down by leftist protesters who are against war.
[00:27:55.203 --> 00:28:03.609]  Here is the latest example at an Ilhan Omar event where she gets disrupted by protesters, anti-war protesters.
[00:28:03.629 --> 00:28:04.290]  Here it is in clip B.
[00:28:06.474 --> 00:28:09.179]  You are supposed to be a progressive Democrat.
[00:28:09.479 --> 00:28:10.561]  Anti-war!
[00:28:11.923 --> 00:28:12.965]  Anti-war!
[00:28:12.985 --> 00:28:16.932]  $80 billion to Ukraine is not anti-war!
[00:28:20.824 --> 00:28:24.046]  Ukraine is killing its own citizens!
[00:28:25.306 --> 00:28:26.287]  In the Donbass!
[00:28:26.407 --> 00:28:34.331]  So, I'll pause it right quick.
[00:28:35.091 --> 00:28:37.492]  She claims that they're helping little children like her.
[00:28:38.033 --> 00:28:39.413]  First of all, that's not even accurate at all.
[00:28:39.754 --> 00:28:44.216]  To act like Ukraine and Somalia are in the same situation is just ridiculous.
[00:28:45.706 --> 00:28:47.529]  But... Oh, okay.
[00:28:47.689 --> 00:28:49.572]  Let us pretend like we can take that at face value.
[00:28:50.153 --> 00:28:54.880]  Oh, so you mean... We're gonna take in Ukrainian refugees like yourself?
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:59.446]  Who then end up working to destroy the very country that gave them a second shot at life?
[00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:07.977]  Just like we took in Ilhan Omar and gave her everything and now she works to destroy the country that took her in?
[00:29:08.097 --> 00:29:09.899]  That's what it's all about to her and Ukraine?
[00:29:10.499 --> 00:29:11.761]  Oh, now I get it.
[00:29:12.141 --> 00:29:18.247]  Let's bring in other foreigners like Ilhan Omar to come to the United States of America and destroy it!
[00:29:19.108 --> 00:29:29.955]  That's, because I guess that's a, I guess her saying she's anti-war but being pro-destroying America with foreigners is a better stance to take in response to this protester.
[00:29:29.975 --> 00:29:34.118]  So guys, pick it up where we left it off here and we will finish up the clip.
[00:29:34.138 --> 00:29:34.518]  Go ahead.
[00:29:35.539 --> 00:29:40.182]  We are helping little children like me that have been held.
[00:29:40.222 --> 00:29:52.939]   So unless, unless, listen, listen, unless you have not been paying attention, To what is happening, there are millions of Ukrainians that have been displaced.
[00:29:53.424 --> 00:29:59.267]  There are piles of bodies that are being found in mass graves.
[00:29:59.647 --> 00:30:04.069]  There are little children whose lives are being lost.
[00:30:04.249 --> 00:30:05.310]  By Zelensky!
[00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:08.551]  Yeah, Zelensky and the Ukrainians are doing all of this with our weapons.
[00:30:08.631 --> 00:30:19.897]  But unless you are someone like me that has been that child, you do not get to tell me what my votes mean and how I get to vote in support of people.
[00:30:19.937 --> 00:30:21.618]  See, and there it is right there.
[00:30:22.791 --> 00:30:29.775]  There is the entire psychology for where they're coming from on display here.
[00:30:30.695 --> 00:30:36.078]  I'm bigger and better than you, so my opinion matters more than yours.
[00:30:37.453 --> 00:30:45.979]  I was a refugee from Somalia, therefore I'm more important than you, my opinion matters more than you, and you don't get to criticize anything I do.
[00:30:46.159 --> 00:30:47.019]  Do you see that mentality?
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.320]  It's the same thing.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.663]  Oh, I'm a gay liberal, so I get to strip naked in front of children and make them grab my genitals.
[00:30:55.264 --> 00:30:56.645]  I'm pro-trans kids.
[00:30:56.986 --> 00:31:00.288]  I get to chop up little boys and girls and call it gender affirmation care.
[00:31:00.568 --> 00:31:01.108]  You bigot.
[00:31:01.468 --> 00:31:02.289]  You transphobe.
[00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:05.051]  Oh, I'm black.
[00:31:06.204 --> 00:31:10.007]  And so you can't criticize anything I do because I'm a victim here.
[00:31:10.327 --> 00:31:10.888]  I'm black.
[00:31:11.709 --> 00:31:13.630]  This is the psychology of the left.
[00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:15.892]  This is why they have the victim economy.
[00:31:16.212 --> 00:31:23.198]  This is why they want to have the victim totem pole putting you at the bottom of it and they perched on top of you.
[00:31:23.658 --> 00:31:24.879]  You can't criticize them.
[00:31:25.079 --> 00:31:26.320]  They're bigger victims than you.
[00:31:27.481 --> 00:31:28.002]  So imagine.
[00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:38.215]  So the protester says, you said you were anti-war, you have funded the war in Ukraine, that's not anti-war.
[00:31:39.075 --> 00:31:45.959]  And then Ilhan Omar says, because I was a little girl in a war-torn nation, you can't criticize me or anything I do.
[00:31:47.961 --> 00:31:58.067]  But then the protester, obviously more informed than she is, says, you do understand that that's Ukraine and Zelensky bombing Ukrainians in Donbass, that's not Russia.
[00:31:59.608 --> 00:32:04.691]  And she just goes on to say, you can't criticize me, I'm a Somali refugee.
[00:32:04.831 --> 00:32:09.453]  And then she says that they're not anti-war protesters, even though that's exactly what they are.
[00:32:09.473 --> 00:32:11.875]  So imagine, I mean, this is the clown world of it.
[00:32:12.555 --> 00:32:28.764]  You go to a Democrat event as an anti-war protester because you're anti-war, and the Democrats are getting us into a war with Russia, and you say, I'm gonna make a disturbance here because I'm anti-war and I don't like what the Democrats representing me are doing, and then they say, how dare you, you're not anti-war.
[00:32:31.189 --> 00:32:33.071]  That's how fast reality comes at you.
[00:32:34.772 --> 00:32:36.313]  That's how fast it comes at you now.
[00:32:38.615 --> 00:32:41.998]  And I would imagine this trend is going to continue.
[00:32:42.058 --> 00:32:44.961]  Now, the major push ahead of midterms here...
[00:32:46.488 --> 00:32:48.949]  Biden's student loan forgiveness has been a disaster.
[00:32:48.989 --> 00:32:50.710]  I think they fired it off too early.
[00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:52.490]  Nobody's getting the student loan forgiveness.
[00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:53.331]  People are complaining.
[00:32:53.351 --> 00:32:54.611]  They're saying Biden lied about it.
[00:32:55.432 --> 00:32:56.932]  And it's just illegal to do it.
[00:32:57.012 --> 00:32:58.313]  It's not holding up in the courts.
[00:32:58.613 --> 00:33:04.975]  And so the Biden administration came out today and said, Biden predicts student loan forgiveness checks will go out within two weeks.
[00:33:05.255 --> 00:33:06.636]  Oh, just before midterms.
[00:33:06.876 --> 00:33:07.956]  I got news for you, liberals.
[00:33:08.337 --> 00:33:08.997]  They're lying.
[00:33:10.123 --> 00:33:11.864]  You're not going to get that student debt relief.
[00:33:12.304 --> 00:33:13.344]  Biden lied to you.
[00:33:13.584 --> 00:33:14.644]  The Democrats lied to you.
[00:33:14.844 --> 00:33:16.465]  They can't even legally do it.
[00:33:17.745 --> 00:33:23.347]  They tried to buy your vote and they assume you're stupid enough to fall for it, even though you won't get the money.
[00:33:23.567 --> 00:33:25.727]  Hey, I'm going to give you 200 bucks to vote Democrat.
[00:33:26.208 --> 00:33:26.628]  Oh, OK.
[00:33:27.688 --> 00:33:28.248]  Weeks go by.
[00:33:28.288 --> 00:33:29.328]  Hey, where's my 200 bucks?
[00:33:29.448 --> 00:33:29.989]  It's coming.
[00:33:31.169 --> 00:33:31.949]  Tomorrow's the midterm.
[00:33:31.969 --> 00:33:32.709]  Where's my 200 bucks?
[00:33:32.729 --> 00:33:33.630]  Don't worry, it's coming.
[00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:34.490]  No, it's never coming.
[00:33:35.947 --> 00:33:40.789]  But that's okay, because Biden apparently is driving cars with Jay Leno.
[00:33:41.229 --> 00:33:46.291]  Biden pushes Corvette to 118 miles per hour in drag race against Colin Powell's son, so he's having fun.
[00:33:46.331 --> 00:33:47.631]  He can drive the gas-powered car.
[00:33:48.271 --> 00:33:53.073]  Vice President Harris announces $1 billion for electric school buses in all 50 states.
[00:33:53.473 --> 00:33:56.414]  That's a nice little flower for her.
[00:33:56.434 --> 00:33:58.615]  It's not going to solve climate change, but she gets to celebrate.
[00:33:59.475 --> 00:34:06.129]   So last night, There was an intruder at the Pelosi mansion.
[00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:07.390]  The Pelosi estate.
[00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:08.290]  It's gigantic.
[00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:08.751]  It's huge.
[00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:11.092]  Because they're rich.
[00:34:12.592 --> 00:34:18.915]  And... Paul Pelosi was home and was attacked with a hammer.
[00:34:20.336 --> 00:34:27.419]  And sent to the emergency room, and now more is developing as far as the details in this story are concerned.
[00:34:28.019 --> 00:34:43.444]  They're claiming that the assailant, the home invader, was shouting, where is Nancy, where is Nancy, and went in the house looking for Nancy Pelosi, and of course this is the Democrat angle of, were the victims here, C-MAGA extremists are trying to have us killed.
[00:34:44.585 --> 00:34:53.664]   Now, before I get into the questions as far as that story is concerned, should we not
[00:34:53.664 --> 00:34:55.503]  look at the obvious here?
[00:34:55.503 --> 00:35:05.505]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:34:56.864 --> 00:35:04.666]  Democrats have been engaged in domestic terrorism for my entire life.
[00:35:05.847 --> 00:35:13.649]  I don't like to say I'm a victim, because these people only come at me because I'm a freedom fighter.
[00:35:14.469 --> 00:35:25.173]   But no, I could sit here and I could show the dozens of death threats that I get, I can show I've had two incidents where leftist terrorists have come to my private residence.
[00:35:25.193 --> 00:35:26.233]  It's happened twice in my life.
[00:35:28.914 --> 00:35:29.735]  And I can get into all that.
[00:35:29.775 --> 00:35:30.655]  And it's not just me.
[00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.395]  It's probably a lot of you in the audience.
[00:35:32.456 --> 00:35:43.655]   We've had dozens of GOP headquarters firebombed, planned, excuse me, rather, non-abortion support
[00:35:43.655 --> 00:35:47.655]  centers for women, pro-life centers for women firebombed.
[00:35:48.002 --> 00:35:50.665]  I mean, do we even have to get into all the Democrat terrorism of 2020?
[00:35:50.725 --> 00:35:54.090]  Do we have to get into the CHAZ and the CHOP?
[00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:58.636]  Do we have to get into Democrats and liberals trying to burn federal buildings, burn police stations?
[00:35:58.676 --> 00:36:00.138]  We all remember all of that!
[00:36:01.425 --> 00:36:04.509]  They just sent an assassin to try to kill Justice Kavanaugh.
[00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:09.837]  They sent an assassin to the Republican baseball practice to try to engage in a mass shooting of Republicans.
[00:36:10.117 --> 00:36:11.339]  Shot Steve Scalise and others.
[00:36:11.579 --> 00:36:14.964]  They've tried to attack and kill Rand Paul multiple times.
[00:36:15.545 --> 00:36:17.268]  So, I mean, if you want to look at a rap sheet...
[00:36:18.649 --> 00:36:28.098]  Let's say you decide to take this story at the face value that a conservative went to hunt down Nancy Pelosi in her home with a hammer shouting, where is Nancy?
[00:36:28.578 --> 00:36:30.280]  So, okay, let's take a look at a rap sheet.
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:38.787]  The Democrat domestic terror rap sheet is about 10 million pages long, from the KKK to the Weather Underground to Antifa and BLM.
[00:36:39.767 --> 00:36:42.608]  And to just their random supporters going out to assassinate Republicans.
[00:36:43.509 --> 00:36:46.571]  Their rap sheet is about 10,000, 10 million pages long.
[00:36:46.991 --> 00:36:49.552]  The conservative rap sheet of violence is a page.
[00:36:49.812 --> 00:36:50.192]  One page.
[00:36:52.193 --> 00:36:58.877]  So I'm not going to sit here and get gaslit by the Democrats crying victim.
[00:37:00.576 --> 00:37:10.381]  If it's even true that a crazed conservative went into the house of the Pelosi's to try to harm Nancy Pelosi with a hammer, which I don't even believe that.
[00:37:11.021 --> 00:37:12.962]  But let's say I take that at face value.
[00:37:13.283 --> 00:37:14.283]  We condemn that.
[00:37:15.084 --> 00:37:16.364]  We don't promote violence.
[00:37:16.404 --> 00:37:17.425]  We're not violent people.
[00:37:17.465 --> 00:37:18.405]  That's not what we do.
[00:37:18.545 --> 00:37:23.468]  I fully condemn someone going into Nancy Pelosi's house with a hammer to try to do her harm.
[00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:24.268]  Fully condemn it.
[00:37:24.568 --> 00:37:27.650]  Now, you'll never see that action out of Democrat liberals.
[00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:32.352]  They never condemn their terrorism, because at the end of the day, they support it.
[00:37:32.972 --> 00:37:33.952]  They cheer it on.
[00:37:34.272 --> 00:37:35.733]  They bail out the terrorists.
[00:37:36.453 --> 00:37:37.494]  Like Kamala Harris did.
[00:37:39.374 --> 00:37:49.018]  But okay, at face value, I think all conservatives will condone violence being done to the Pelosi in the name of politics.
[00:37:49.446 --> 00:37:57.555]  I don't think a conservative will have any problem with those words coming out of their mouths today, even if most of us don't even believe that that's the truth.
[00:37:57.655 --> 00:37:59.057]  But okay, there you go.
[00:38:00.138 --> 00:38:03.702]  Democrat domestic terror rap sheet, thousands of pages long.
[00:38:06.044 --> 00:38:09.288]  And of course, the conservative rap sheet, a single page.
[00:38:11.107 --> 00:38:11.907]  But we condone that.
[00:38:12.608 --> 00:38:12.928]  Fine.
[00:38:13.568 --> 00:38:15.229]  But oh, see what they did on January 6th?
[00:38:15.249 --> 00:38:17.650]  They got all the conservatives, all the Republicans to condone that.
[00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:20.291]  Now that looks like it was actually a Fed's erection.
[00:38:20.611 --> 00:38:21.912]  But I'll have more on that coming up.
[00:38:22.272 --> 00:38:23.373]  Back to the story last night.
[00:38:23.993 --> 00:38:28.355]  So others are mentioning this is not the first time there's been a security breach in the Pelosi neighborhood.
[00:38:28.415 --> 00:38:36.561]   Even Harmeet Dhillon A lawyer who has experience with this story and specific knowledge on it is saying, how could this be possible?
[00:38:37.401 --> 00:38:40.863]  The neighborhood the Pelosi's are in is extremely secure.
[00:38:40.963 --> 00:38:42.624]  It's a bunch of millionaires that live there.
[00:38:43.504 --> 00:38:50.007]  The house that the Pelosi's live in is secure in its own right with a private gated fence and security cameras and security.
[00:38:51.550 --> 00:39:00.736]  So how does a lone hammer man get through all of that security undetected into the Pelosi home undetected?
[00:39:01.576 --> 00:39:05.339]  Not only that, but we have no videos or images of the individual?
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:06.940]  None?
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.561]  Now let's recall.
[00:39:11.122 --> 00:39:22.300]   Just earlier this week, Katie Hobbs' campaign blamed a break-in at her campaign headquarters on Carrie Lake supporters.
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:33.709]  Then, when the image came out of the criminal, and the investigation was launched into the criminal, all of a sudden, Katie Hobbs' campaign quit blaming it on Carrie Lake.
[00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:37.092]  All of a sudden, Katie Hobbs' campaign stopped talking about that.
[00:39:37.633 --> 00:39:37.953]  Huh.
[00:39:38.453 --> 00:39:39.814]  I wonder why that would be.
[00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:54.718]  Obviously they lied and they knew it wasn't a member of Carly Lake's supporting voters and it was either a random act of criminality or even they false flagged themselves to blame Lake in their desperation.
[00:39:55.258 --> 00:40:02.493]   Either way, they got wildly silent after screaming As loudly as they can.
[00:40:02.873 --> 00:40:04.616]  Look at what Carrie Lake did to us!
[00:40:04.876 --> 00:40:07.439]  She sent a terrorist into our campaign headquarters!
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:13.868]  Then the Lake campaign denied it, shared the image of the individual, said it's under investigation, and all of a sudden the Hobbs campaign crickets.
[00:40:15.951 --> 00:40:18.435]  So what's the real story with the Nancy Pelosi break-in?
[00:40:20.908 --> 00:40:24.449]  I would say, well look, look at how much crime there is in California.
[00:40:24.469 --> 00:40:26.250]  Look at how much crime there is in San Francisco.
[00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:27.570]  Are you really surprised?
[00:40:28.171 --> 00:40:32.412]  A break-in at your house is almost an odds-on favorite these days, even if you are Nancy Pelosi.
[00:40:32.472 --> 00:40:40.755]  But no, if it was a conservative crazy that went in there looking for Nancy Pelosi, we condemn it.
[00:40:40.895 --> 00:40:41.555]  That is bad.
[00:40:41.835 --> 00:40:45.657]  We hope that the investigation bears fruit and the criminal is brought to justice.
[00:40:46.584 --> 00:40:50.487]  But I'm sorry that I can't sit here and believe that at face value.
[00:40:51.428 --> 00:40:52.649]  No, no I can't.
[00:40:52.909 --> 00:40:55.391]  We know Democrats do false flags against themselves.
[00:40:55.851 --> 00:40:58.834]  We know that the hate crime hoax is a massive phenomenon.
[00:40:59.314 --> 00:41:01.175]  In fact, there was a book that just came out.
[00:41:01.256 --> 00:41:02.737]  I'm looking forward to reading this book.
[00:41:04.369 --> 00:41:05.390]  I forget the gentleman's name.
[00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:06.510]  He was on Fox News last night.
[00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:10.152]  It was Ridley something who just wrote a book about hate crime hoaxes.
[00:41:10.192 --> 00:41:11.193]  An entire book!
[00:41:11.213 --> 00:41:14.815]  I mean folks, we have dozens on record of hate crime hoaxes.
[00:41:15.015 --> 00:41:16.456]  And it's always the same side doing it.
[00:41:17.537 --> 00:41:18.157]  The left.
[00:41:20.899 --> 00:41:22.660]  From Jussie Smollett.
[00:41:24.056 --> 00:41:36.583]  To the Boston Children's Hospital fake bomber, where they write stories calling me a conspiracy theorist because I accurately cover the news when it was mainstream news that that was a hoax.
[00:41:38.544 --> 00:41:40.985]  But so what is the real story with the Pelosi break-in?
[00:41:42.318 --> 00:41:49.723]  Who knows if we'll ever know the truth, but at the time, they're trying to blame Trump, they're trying to blame conservatives, saying, look, conservatives are violent, they came into my house.
[00:41:50.063 --> 00:42:04.552]  But of course, the real story would be, okay, so if that's bad, so if somebody breaking into Pelosi's house to do harm to the Pelosi's is bad, and it is, then what do you call all of the domestic terrorism from the Democrat Party for my entire life?
[00:42:05.453 --> 00:42:06.253]  Hell on earth?
[00:42:09.015 --> 00:42:11.657]  Well, let's just take a look at what goes on in these Democrat cities.
[00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:17.894]  Seven-year-old boy hit and killed by stray bullet in his Chicago home.
[00:42:19.055 --> 00:42:20.176]  Gun-free zone, by the way.
[00:42:20.817 --> 00:42:22.298]  Gun-free zone, Chicago.
[00:42:22.358 --> 00:42:24.380]  Seven-year-old boy killed by stray bullet.
[00:42:25.021 --> 00:42:25.601]  Gun-free zone.
[00:42:26.502 --> 00:42:32.227]  New York police reveals 25 victims who have been shoved in front of subway cars so far this year.
[00:42:32.688 --> 00:42:36.491]  With two months to go, two victims killed, 20 narrowly avoided death.
[00:42:37.272 --> 00:42:38.493]  Was that white supremacists doing that?
[00:42:38.513 --> 00:42:38.733]  No.
[00:42:39.174 --> 00:42:39.254]  No.
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:43.528]  Woman, 18 years old, stabbed and hit by stranger on Brooklyn Street.
[00:42:43.748 --> 00:42:47.857]  Woman, just standing on the street corner, guy just randomly comes up, stabs her, walks away.
[00:42:47.877 --> 00:42:49.982]  Is that white supremacy?
[00:42:50.663 --> 00:42:50.744]  No.
[00:42:51.724 --> 00:42:56.068]  Youth, youth, who stabbed home intruder, jailed for three and a half years.
[00:42:56.088 --> 00:42:58.090]  Now this is actually a wild story out of Ireland.
[00:42:59.051 --> 00:43:05.378]  An individual breaks into his home, the young man stabs and kills the intruder, he gets three and a half years.
[00:43:06.178 --> 00:43:11.204]  So in America, if you're a criminal who stabs somebody in the streets, you get released from jail the next day.
[00:43:11.664 --> 00:43:15.428]  In Ireland, you stab somebody that invades your house, you get three and a half years in jail.
[00:43:15.948 --> 00:43:16.528]  Crazy.
[00:43:16.869 --> 00:43:17.709]  Back to America, though.
[00:43:18.229 --> 00:43:21.871]  Slain landlord found in freezer, called police many times on tenant.
[00:43:21.911 --> 00:43:37.340]  Now, why would a person of color, renting from a white woman, decide that she doesn't have to pay rent, and when the white woman demands that she pay rent, she decides to chop her up and put her in a freezer?
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:38.941]  Why would that be?
[00:43:40.407 --> 00:43:42.388]  Who would have given her that idea?
[00:43:42.889 --> 00:43:46.331]  Guys, please pull up the New York Post story for me so we can get a look at this.
[00:43:49.153 --> 00:44:03.675]   Tenant Sandra Kolalu, 36, has been charged with murder of Frances Walker, 69, who was found in a freezer in her north side home after a resident of the building I don't promote things unless they really work.
[00:44:03.575 --> 00:44:08.655]   she didn't want to pay rent and after all she's a minority so she shouldn't
[00:44:08.655 --> 00:44:12.215]   have to pay rent and if you make her pay rent as a white person you should get
[00:44:12.215 --> 00:44:18.494]   murdered who would have given her that idea not the peace-loving Democrats
[00:44:18.494 --> 00:44:29.495]   I don't promote things unless they really work when it comes to politics or
[00:44:29.495 --> 00:44:34.335]   culture, economics, we are always the cutting edge tip of the spear.
[00:44:34.366 --> 00:44:38.669]  And when we talk about the products at InfoWareStore.com, they all blow you away.
[00:44:38.949 --> 00:44:42.853]  If you'll just take them, if you'll just try them, I know you'll be repeat customers.
[00:44:43.413 --> 00:44:47.516]  And finally, one of our best selling products, sold out for months, it's back in stock, it's X3.

[00:45:07.797 --> 00:45:10.597]  and it funds the InfoWar, which is a 360 win.
[00:45:10.597 --> 00:45:14.637]   If you've not experienced the power of iodine, it takes two weeks to kick it on average,

[00:45:18.476 --> 00:45:22.076]  X3 50% off, InfoWarStore.com.
[00:45:22.076 --> 00:45:27.277]  Boy, it's been a rough go for Paul Pelosi.
[00:45:27.277 --> 00:45:37.277]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:45:28.328 --> 00:45:30.549]  Married to the Wicked Witch of the West.
[00:45:31.129 --> 00:45:32.490]  Death warmed over Nancy.
[00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:36.931]  Then drives his car completely inebriated.
[00:45:38.512 --> 00:45:39.312]  Gets in a crash.
[00:45:40.593 --> 00:45:43.914]  You would probably be in jail for years if you did that, not Paul Pelosi.
[00:45:44.634 --> 00:45:51.097]  And then he's at home when somebody allegedly breaks in and tries to harm his wife with a hammer and instead takes it out on him.
[00:45:53.397 --> 00:45:57.234]   But of course, people are Wondering what the real story is.
[00:45:57.274 --> 00:45:58.655]  And that's just where we're at now.
[00:45:58.915 --> 00:46:00.675]  And sadly, this is on both sides of the aisle.
[00:46:00.735 --> 00:46:01.875]  Nobody trusts anybody anymore.
[00:46:02.676 --> 00:46:09.797]  But Democrats have a track record of faking hate crimes and lying.
[00:46:10.057 --> 00:46:11.838]  And so of course people are questioning it.
[00:46:13.238 --> 00:46:17.979]  But again, what happened to the slain landlord in Chicago?
[00:46:20.117 --> 00:46:27.703]  When Sandra Kowlalu chopped her up and put her in a freezer because she was demanding that she pay her rent.
[00:46:30.025 --> 00:46:36.270]  Why would a black woman feel that she doesn't have to pay rent to the white woman?
[00:46:36.971 --> 00:46:41.254]  And when the white woman demands rent, she says, well, I'm going to chop you up and put you in a freezer.
[00:46:41.655 --> 00:46:41.995]  Why?
[00:46:42.095 --> 00:46:43.536]  Who would have given her that idea?
[00:46:43.917 --> 00:46:46.519]  Not the Party of Peace, the Democrats, of course not.
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:48.841]  Of course not them.
[00:46:50.589 --> 00:46:55.031]  Police have already been called on the killer five times in October alone.
[00:46:55.051 --> 00:46:55.111]  Hmm.
[00:46:56.912 --> 00:46:57.052]  Hmm.
[00:46:59.372 --> 00:47:03.254]  But I guess, you know, with Democrat logic, we should ban knives and we should ban hammers, right?
[00:47:04.675 --> 00:47:05.015]  Right.
[00:47:06.155 --> 00:47:07.336]  Right, right, right, right.
[00:47:08.076 --> 00:47:12.518]  Macron admits half of the crimes in Paris are committed by foreigners.
[00:47:13.738 --> 00:47:15.539]  But keep those borders wide open, right?
[00:47:16.892 --> 00:47:20.415]  Keep those borders wide open and keep those foreigners pouring across.
[00:47:20.435 --> 00:47:21.736]  Because we love them.
[00:47:22.457 --> 00:47:27.922]  Now, even when he gets something right, we'll call him by his real name, Cenk Uygur.
[00:47:29.045 --> 00:47:31.648]  Formerly known as Chunk Yogurt of the Young Turks.
[00:47:32.128 --> 00:47:34.871]  He's like had some sort of an epiphany, whether he realizes it or not.
[00:47:34.971 --> 00:47:40.197]  I don't know if maybe he got, maybe he went into the deep Amazon rainforest and had some ayahuasca.
[00:47:40.617 --> 00:47:42.179]  Maybe he smoked some DMT.
[00:47:42.599 --> 00:47:44.601]  Maybe he consumed some magical mushrooms.
[00:47:44.982 --> 00:47:46.964]  But he seems to have some sort of an awakening here.
[00:47:47.324 --> 00:47:50.368]  He's calling out Democrat liberal cities are turning into hell holes.
[00:47:51.827 --> 00:47:53.828]  And then a couple more instances here.
[00:47:54.128 --> 00:47:59.171]  He says, I hope Karen Bass proves me wrong, but I would be shocked if she changed the status quo even a tiny bit.
[00:47:59.191 --> 00:48:01.873]  Well, yeah, that's the Democrat status quo of violent cities.
[00:48:02.833 --> 00:48:04.054]  What did she do in Congress?
[00:48:04.554 --> 00:48:05.715]  Approximately nothing.
[00:48:06.175 --> 00:48:08.476]  That's what establishment Dems always do.
[00:48:09.037 --> 00:48:09.237]  L.A.
[00:48:09.297 --> 00:48:10.397]  desperately needs change.
[00:48:10.598 --> 00:48:13.079]  If you don't think it doesn't need a change, that's amazing.
[00:48:13.239 --> 00:48:13.759]  Watch St.
[00:48:13.799 --> 00:48:14.700]  Hugo getting one right.
[00:48:15.959 --> 00:48:16.359]  Another one.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:23.383]  There is this persistent irrationality in American politics that people assume you love the person you're voting for and think they're perfect.
[00:48:23.744 --> 00:48:26.005]  No, it just means they're better than your other choice.
[00:48:26.345 --> 00:48:27.846]  Why is this so hard for people to understand?
[00:48:27.886 --> 00:48:29.367]  It's an incredibly simple concept.
[00:48:29.947 --> 00:48:31.248]  Wait, are you talking about Trump?
[00:48:33.449 --> 00:48:34.710]  Are you talking about Trump here?
[00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:39.233]  Because that's what people were saying about Trump and now you're saying about Biden.
[00:48:39.953 --> 00:48:40.133]  Odd.
[00:48:41.854 --> 00:48:42.415]  Odd indeed.
[00:48:43.836 --> 00:48:44.076]  Hmm.
[00:48:45.908 --> 00:48:46.749]  And then there's this.
[00:48:46.809 --> 00:48:49.472]  Get used to this because this is the new world order.
[00:48:49.572 --> 00:48:54.317]  This is the end man-made climate change green new deal right here for you.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:01.005]  Thousands too ashamed to go to work because they can't afford soap and deodorant.
[00:49:02.426 --> 00:49:02.687]  Good!
[00:49:04.844 --> 00:49:05.404]  That's good!
[00:49:06.025 --> 00:49:16.193]  A report suggests 3.2 million of adults in Britain are in hygiene poverty and many are ashamed to go to work because they cannot afford items such as soap and deodorant.
[00:49:16.874 --> 00:49:17.414]  Good!
[00:49:17.434 --> 00:49:19.676]  Don't you get it?
[00:49:19.776 --> 00:49:20.616]  That's good!
[00:49:21.097 --> 00:49:22.778]  You're causing climate change!
[00:49:23.699 --> 00:49:24.640]  I don't know what it is.
[00:49:26.254 --> 00:49:32.494]   about logic and some people's inability to have it or some people's inability to reach
[00:49:32.494 --> 00:49:39.173]  conclusions because logic is not a... it moves.
[00:49:39.187 --> 00:49:39.728]  It's moving.
[00:49:40.128 --> 00:49:42.388]  Logic leads to conclusions.
[00:49:42.388 --> 00:49:47.128]   So what do you think is gonna happen with your whole stop man-made climate change?
[00:49:47.128 --> 00:49:50.448]  When you shut off energy, shut off oil.
[00:49:50.448 --> 00:49:53.908]   Like, yeah, you're not gonna have hygiene products, you're not gonna have warm showers,
[00:49:53.908 --> 00:49:56.347]   you're not gonna have running water, you're not gonna have plumbing,
[00:49:56.347 --> 00:49:58.507]   you're not gonna have heating, you're not gonna have air conditioning,
[00:49:58.507 --> 00:50:00.628]   you're not gonna go to work, you're not gonna have a car.
[00:50:00.628 --> 00:50:04.448]   So they sit here and they're like, "Stop oil, stop energy, stop climate change."
[00:50:04.448 --> 00:50:08.307]   And then they're like, "I'm so poor, "I can't afford anything, what's going on?"
[00:50:08.447 --> 00:50:09.787]  That's what you wanted!
[00:50:10.348 --> 00:50:11.769]  You're saving the planet now!
[00:50:11.849 --> 00:50:12.509]  Just die!
[00:50:12.529 --> 00:50:15.451]  Alright, I want to get into the Twitter news now.
[00:50:15.991 --> 00:50:26.417]  And guys, let's put this image on screen so the people can see who has been censoring them on Twitter for the last year.
[00:50:26.938 --> 00:50:30.400]  There are the people who have been censoring you on Twitter.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:31.721]  How does that make you feel?
[00:50:33.222 --> 00:50:42.035]   How does that make you feel that these two individuals Have been censoring your free speech, the free speech of Americans, censored by these two.
[00:50:46.539 --> 00:50:55.285]  You know, there's this thing about America and about American people called freedom of speech and it's something we really believe in.
[00:50:55.365 --> 00:51:04.532]  It's part of our destiny to be free and show the world the meaning of freedom and the results of freedom with the prosperity that it brings.
[00:51:06.571 --> 00:51:13.996]  And when you have foreigners come here that don't have those same values that shut off and cut off our freedoms, they just don't get it, folks.
[00:51:15.037 --> 00:51:15.878]  They don't get it.
[00:51:17.359 --> 00:51:21.501]  Most people that live in this country have one or two things in their background.
[00:51:22.982 --> 00:51:30.007]  And that is a struggle to get to this country and earn their freedom through the means of immigration.
[00:51:31.989 --> 00:51:39.424]   Or The struggle of wars and fighting and bloodshed to earn their freedom.
[00:51:40.224 --> 00:51:43.025]  So when you earn that freedom, it means something to you.
[00:51:43.425 --> 00:51:45.806]  Something really deep in your soul.
[00:51:47.147 --> 00:51:47.947]  It's in your blood.
[00:51:47.967 --> 00:51:48.828]  It's in your makeup.
[00:51:48.888 --> 00:51:49.908]  It's in your consciousness.
[00:51:49.948 --> 00:51:50.929]  It never goes away.
[00:51:50.969 --> 00:51:52.269]  It can't be put out.
[00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:54.330]  It's an infinite flame.
[00:51:55.551 --> 00:52:00.473]  So when people that don't have that flame come here and shut off your free speech, they really don't get it.
[00:52:01.331 --> 00:52:07.775]  These two never got it, they never will get it, and they never should have had it to begin with.
[00:52:09.756 --> 00:52:10.957]  So how does that make you feel?
[00:52:11.417 --> 00:52:14.899]  And this goes on at every other big tech company.
[00:52:16.638 --> 00:52:29.389]  So I'm sorry that these two don't have the desire to be free, and the loyalty and commitment and understanding of what that means to the American people, but thank God Elon Musk does, and thank God he took out the trash.
[00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:32.052]  Goodbye Freedom-Haters!
[00:52:32.572 --> 00:52:33.173]  Get out!
[00:52:34.654 --> 00:52:38.397]  But like good communists, don't worry, they got paid on the way out.
[00:52:38.797 --> 00:52:41.300]  These two are going to make approximately $200 million.
[00:52:45.092 --> 00:52:45.612]  Oh, and the left.
[00:52:45.872 --> 00:52:47.493]  Oh, the left is against rich people.
[00:52:47.813 --> 00:52:49.994]  Oh, the millionaires are so bad.
[00:52:50.954 --> 00:52:57.096]  And then all the people they look up to, all the people that are thought leaders, all the people that censor the opposition, they're all millionaires.
[00:52:58.756 --> 00:52:59.957]  Isn't that ironic?
[00:53:02.377 --> 00:53:05.458]  So yeah, sorry, you never supported free speech.
[00:53:05.478 --> 00:53:06.999]  Sorry, you never got it, did ya?
[00:53:08.799 --> 00:53:10.280]  You never got it, did ya?
[00:53:12.401 --> 00:53:13.502]  Maybe you never will.
[00:53:13.742 --> 00:53:14.682]  I hope someday you will.
[00:53:16.003 --> 00:53:21.986]  I hope someday people will understand what you understand, what I understand, the value of the First and Second Amendment.
[00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:32.812]  But Bajaj Gaddai and Parag Agrawal never got it, and sadly never will get it.
[00:53:34.393 --> 00:53:35.273]  But that's okay.
[00:53:36.954 --> 00:53:40.536]  Because you will never put out our flame of liberty.
[00:53:41.377 --> 00:53:41.557]  Ever.
[00:53:43.089 --> 00:53:43.850]  You never will.
[00:53:46.731 --> 00:53:48.052]  You never will.
[00:53:51.054 --> 00:53:51.935]  So, good riddance.
[00:53:52.975 --> 00:53:57.498]  Don't let the door hit you on the way out with your hundreds of millions of dollars that you're making on the way out.
[00:53:58.839 --> 00:54:00.640]  Oh, I'm sure they'll give it all to charity, too.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:01.921]  Yeah, right.
[00:54:03.925 --> 00:54:10.269]  So they're panicked, though, because Elon Musk is taking over and their anti-American censors are out.
[00:54:10.909 --> 00:54:12.010]  Wired Magazine.
[00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:17.594]  A Musk-owned Twitter could be disastrous for women and marginalized communities.
[00:54:17.854 --> 00:54:18.734]  Oh, there it is.
[00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:19.795]  Yes, oh.
[00:54:20.956 --> 00:54:28.080]  Disastrous for women and marginalized communities already facing abuse and targeted harassment on the platform.
[00:54:28.921 --> 00:54:28.981]  Oh!
[00:54:32.093 --> 00:54:32.894]  Hey, here's an idea.
[00:54:33.414 --> 00:54:35.895]  If you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen.
[00:54:38.317 --> 00:54:39.297]  You ever heard that one before?
[00:54:40.098 --> 00:54:43.780]  If you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.921]  Nobody's making you go on Twitter.
[00:54:49.944 --> 00:54:54.647]  Women in marginalized communities already facing abuse on Twitter.
[00:54:56.148 --> 00:54:57.208]  It's so hard for them.
[00:55:00.712 --> 00:55:02.493]  What are they even doing there, then, if it's so bad?
[00:55:03.573 --> 00:55:06.014]  You wanna know just how psychotic these people are, though?
[00:55:06.755 --> 00:55:08.095]  I mean, do you really wanna know?
[00:55:08.996 --> 00:55:09.756]  Folks, it's bad.
[00:55:09.956 --> 00:55:10.336]  Trust me.
[00:55:10.896 --> 00:55:11.917]  I go into their minds.
[00:55:12.077 --> 00:55:13.558]  It is a place.
[00:55:13.658 --> 00:55:15.518]  It is empty, actually.
[00:55:15.638 --> 00:55:16.379]  It's empty.
[00:55:16.599 --> 00:55:18.920]  Nothing but state propaganda.
[00:55:20.387 --> 00:55:21.507]  Bouncing around in there.
[00:55:21.567 --> 00:55:23.508]  No God, no soul, no light.
[00:55:23.988 --> 00:55:25.649]  Just darkness and propaganda.
[00:55:26.209 --> 00:55:28.170]  Like JoJo from JURORS.
[00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:32.172]  Now, nobody actually follows this woman, but she's always on your news feeds.
[00:55:32.352 --> 00:55:34.853]  I don't think that's going to be continuing much longer, by the way.
[00:55:35.865 --> 00:55:40.687]  All the Democrat Party propaganda forced onto your news feeds is going to be shut down pretty soon.
[00:55:41.087 --> 00:55:44.808]  And all of their synthetic interaction is going to be shut down pretty soon.
[00:55:44.868 --> 00:55:49.450]  So enjoy it while it lasts, guys, because it's not going to go on much longer.
[00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:50.770]  But here she is.
[00:55:51.010 --> 00:56:04.475]  This is a woman paid for by the Democrat Party and synthetically boosted on Twitter to get as much interaction as possible to make sure Democrat Party propaganda enters the mind and the stream of consciousness to the uninformed voter.
[00:56:05.748 --> 00:56:07.149]  Just, you want to know how psycho they are?
[00:56:07.209 --> 00:56:07.990]  Here's an example.
[00:56:08.931 --> 00:56:16.177]  I joined this app, Twitter, in 2017 largely because I wanted to tell Donald Trump that he had old balls and stuff.
[00:56:18.159 --> 00:56:20.381]  Yeah, you're clearly not well in the head, lady.
[00:56:21.062 --> 00:56:24.545]  And while I really, really, really don't want to, I'll do it again if I have to.
[00:56:24.605 --> 00:56:26.086]  So, of course, what's the story here?
[00:56:26.923 --> 00:56:27.643]  And I've got an example.
[00:56:27.683 --> 00:56:28.504]  Here's Robert Reich.
[00:56:29.244 --> 00:56:33.947]  Folks, look, Robert Reich is legitimately mentally retarded.
[00:56:34.888 --> 00:56:38.270]  And so, I mean, it's kind of like, oh, you're ableist.
[00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:45.154]  Well, no, I'm not going to sit here and take serious advice from a man who has an IQ of 10.
[00:56:46.795 --> 00:56:48.976]  But see, oh, here's Robert Reich.
[00:56:49.016 --> 00:56:51.037]  Again, he promotes the Democrat Party propaganda.
[00:56:51.077 --> 00:56:52.038]  He does it for free, though.
[00:56:52.198 --> 00:56:53.579]  See, he's so dumb, he does it for free.
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:57.802]  This was him in July of 2021.
[00:56:59.362 --> 00:57:04.385]  Trump is suing Facebook, Twitter, and Google for violating his First Amendment rights by keeping him off their platforms.
[00:57:04.705 --> 00:57:08.308]  Someone should remind him that they're private companies to which the First Amendment doesn't apply.
[00:57:08.428 --> 00:57:13.831]  Okay, so Robert Reich, Robert Third Reich, Robert Fourth Reich, says censorship is good!
[00:57:14.731 --> 00:57:16.493]  Censorship is perfectly good and legal.
[00:57:16.553 --> 00:57:17.735]  That was July of last year.
[00:57:17.795 --> 00:57:19.937]  Now here he is, yesterday.
[00:57:20.518 --> 00:57:27.206]  When multi-billionaires take control of our most vital platforms for communication, it's not a win for free speech, it's a win for oligarchy.
[00:57:28.628 --> 00:57:28.848]  Oh!
[00:57:29.289 --> 00:57:30.170]  I see, Robert.
[00:57:31.111 --> 00:57:33.313]  I see, Robert, you tiny small man.
[00:57:34.677 --> 00:57:35.457]  I see, Robert.
[00:57:35.517 --> 00:57:39.939]  So, when the censorship works in your political beliefs favor, it's a good thing.
[00:57:40.619 --> 00:57:46.922]  When the censorship is no longer working in your political favor, it's a bad thing now.
[00:57:47.362 --> 00:57:47.902]  I see.
[00:57:47.922 --> 00:57:50.163]  I got you.
[00:57:50.723 --> 00:57:51.204]  Yeah.
[00:57:52.724 --> 00:57:56.926]  And by the way, Robert was one of the many out there who said he would leave Twitter if Musk took over.
[00:57:59.588 --> 00:58:01.769]  So here's Robert Forthrike today.
[00:58:02.629 --> 00:58:10.413]  I thought I'd leave these here just in case, hypothetically, the new potential owner of Twitter decides to bar videos critiquing billionaires in the system that enables it.
[00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:10.893]  Oh, oh!
[00:58:11.293 --> 00:58:14.374]  Oh, Robert Reich is against censorship now again yesterday!
[00:58:14.434 --> 00:58:20.037]  So, Robert Forthrike was all about censorship when it was President Trump and his supporters.
[00:58:20.597 --> 00:58:27.380]   Now that his opposition is not going to be censored, all of a sudden, He's worried about censorship.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:29.521]  Which, by the way, nobody's going to be censoring the left.
[00:58:29.601 --> 00:58:30.902]  Nobody calls for censorship of the left.
[00:58:30.962 --> 00:58:32.323]  Elon Musk is going to censor the left.
[00:58:33.624 --> 00:58:35.825]  But all of these people were threatening to leave Twitter.
[00:58:35.865 --> 00:58:42.129]  Yes, all the paid-for Democrat bot accounts like Brooklyn Defiant Dad and Jersey Joe and the rest of them.
[00:58:42.489 --> 00:58:43.490]  You've seen them in your newsfeeds.
[00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:44.010]  You don't follow them.
[00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:45.251]  They pop up in your newsfeeds every day.
[00:58:45.291 --> 00:58:46.972]  That's Democrat paid-for party propaganda.
[00:58:48.317 --> 00:58:50.442]  Uh, forced into your news feeds by the Twitter algorithms.
[00:58:50.462 --> 00:58:51.684]  I don't think it lasts much longer.
[00:58:52.205 --> 00:58:54.810]  They all said they would leave Twitter when Elon Musk took over.
[00:58:55.291 --> 00:58:57.395]  How many of them do you think will actually leave?
[00:59:00.529 --> 00:59:00.909]  Zero.
[00:59:01.310 --> 00:59:01.890]  That's how many.
[00:59:02.331 --> 00:59:02.771]  None.
[00:59:03.251 --> 00:59:03.732]  Zero.
[00:59:04.032 --> 00:59:04.432]  Zilch.
[00:59:04.693 --> 00:59:05.073]  Nada.
[00:59:05.573 --> 00:59:06.754]  And that's for two reasons.
[00:59:08.376 --> 00:59:13.040]  One, because they like it too much and they like all the synthetic attention they've been getting.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:13.840]  It's a dopamine hit.
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:14.581]  It's a drug to them.
[00:59:14.821 --> 00:59:17.804]  For the first time in their lives, they feel like they have friends and that they're popular.
[00:59:18.064 --> 00:59:19.865]  Even though it's all fake, they'll have to learn the hard way.
[00:59:20.805 --> 00:59:24.927]  But two, it's the same reason why they never left America when Donald Trump got in office.
[00:59:25.227 --> 00:59:28.208]  They all said they'd leave America when Trump got in, and then they didn't.
[00:59:28.308 --> 00:59:28.648]  Why?
[00:59:29.028 --> 00:59:33.030]  Because America is the best country on Earth, and so of course you don't want to leave.
[00:59:33.310 --> 00:59:33.951]  You frauds.
[00:59:34.991 --> 00:59:37.212]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:59:37.272 --> 00:59:39.153]  They are nothing but distractions.
[00:59:39.433 --> 00:59:41.614]  We need a great reset.
[00:59:41.974 --> 00:59:46.773]   The idea of a wild terrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario.
[00:59:46.773 --> 00:59:51.774]  Get vaccinated, get vaccinated, get vaccinated.
[00:59:51.774 --> 00:59:55.474]   I don't have to sit here and tell you it's coming anymore and show you documents like I used to.
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:57.320]  You're just gonna live it now.
[00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:04.320]  I'm Dr. Fauci!
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:13.320]   Is that a Dr. Fauci Halloween costume or a serial killer Halloween costume?
[01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:14.850]  I can't tell the difference.
[01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:16.971]  Trick question, there is none!
[01:00:17.051 --> 01:00:17.711]  Ha ha ha!
[01:00:18.071 --> 01:00:19.752]  Happy Halloween, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:25.571]  Happy Halloween from all of us here at InfoWars to you.
[01:00:25.591 --> 01:00:28.833]  We hope you have a great weekend.
[01:00:32.215 --> 01:00:48.363]  By the way, I was wondering what the ripple effect would be to free speech being returned to Twitter and if that wouldn't maybe change the tide in the competitive business market of social media for other big tech companies to say, hey, you know what?
[01:00:49.653 --> 01:00:52.698]  We can't have Twitter be the only platform for free speech.
[01:00:52.758 --> 01:00:54.381]  Now we're losing out on revenue.
[01:00:54.942 --> 01:00:56.124]  We need free speech too.
[01:00:56.184 --> 01:00:59.130]  Well, not looking like that's how it's gonna go here.
[01:01:00.512 --> 01:01:02.315]  YouTube announces it will certify.
[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:08.962]  Medical information in cahoots with the World Health Organization.
[01:01:10.443 --> 01:01:10.663]  Nice.
[01:01:10.703 --> 01:01:17.085]  So the commies at the WHO who lie to you for a living are going to control the flow of information on YouTube.
[01:01:17.325 --> 01:01:17.745]  Nice.
[01:01:18.406 --> 01:01:18.806]  Nice.
[01:01:19.546 --> 01:01:20.887]  That's not fascist at all.
[01:01:21.207 --> 01:01:22.167]  That's not collusion.
[01:01:22.827 --> 01:01:23.948]  That's not big government.
[01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:27.449]  Amazing stuff.
[01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:29.230]  Amazing stuff.
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:37.927]  Of course the big question is, will or when will Alex Jones be back on Twitter?
[01:01:39.108 --> 01:01:47.556]  And we may have some information on that coming up in the next hour with a special guest.
[01:01:50.719 --> 01:02:00.368]   I'm debating kind of breaking some stuff that I know about it, but I really don't even want to talk about it because It's the kind of thing where I just want to wait until the thing is complete to report on it.
[01:02:02.188 --> 01:02:04.929]  And the honest truth is right now, I don't know.
[01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:07.870]  I don't know if Alex Jones will ever be allowed back on Twitter.
[01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:10.711]  I don't know if InfoWars will ever be allowed back on Twitter.
[01:02:11.091 --> 01:02:13.151]  I don't know if I will ever be allowed back on Twitter.
[01:02:15.332 --> 01:02:20.533]  I know for myself, speaking for myself personally, of course I would like to be back on Twitter.
[01:02:21.707 --> 01:02:26.448]  And then for InfoWars, of course we would like to be able to be back on Twitter.
[01:02:26.488 --> 01:02:30.369]  Now, people have tried to share our links on Twitter, and you still can't.
[01:02:30.649 --> 01:02:32.949]  Our links are still banned from being shared.
[01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:36.390]  So, we'll see how long that lasts.
[01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:37.950]  And then we'll see.
[01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:42.051]  I mean, I think the Alex Jones account, when it got suspended, had close to 2 million followers.
[01:02:42.731 --> 01:02:43.971]  So, you know, that's a big deal.
[01:02:43.991 --> 01:02:45.452]  That's a big deal.
[01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:49.198]  We shall see.
[01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:58.285]  I know that Elon Musk, who I guess obviously talks to Kanye West, has reinstated Kanye's account.
[01:02:59.626 --> 01:03:04.010]  Elon Musk, who follows the Babylon Bee, has reinstated the Babylon Bee's account.
[01:03:05.631 --> 01:03:08.553]  So these are people that obviously have a direct communication with Elon.
[01:03:08.593 --> 01:03:09.094]  We don't.
[01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:16.570]  But, I think a lot of people will go to bat for Alex Jones, and we shall see if his account is restored.
[01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:21.272]  But there have been so many accounts banned that the process, I'm sure, will take some time.
[01:03:21.992 --> 01:03:32.056]  Now, the globalists, they understand this, but the liberal left don't because they truly cannot even conceive.
[01:03:32.316 --> 01:03:37.858]   The concept of independence and self-sustainability to the left is Not even in their head.
[01:03:37.878 --> 01:03:40.259]  They can't even conceive it.
[01:03:40.319 --> 01:03:47.864]  They can't even perceive it in their heads because they've been suckling off the memories of the state and their daddies their entire lives.
[01:03:48.244 --> 01:03:53.147]  So they thought when they banned InfoWars on social media and big tech, they thought that would be it.
[01:03:54.246 --> 01:03:55.787]  They didn't understand that we were independent.
[01:03:55.807 --> 01:03:57.709]  They didn't understand that we were truly grassroots.
[01:03:57.909 --> 01:03:59.751]  And it was our audience that supported us.
[01:03:59.811 --> 01:04:01.932]  And so as long as we had our audience, we would still be on air.
[01:04:03.033 --> 01:04:06.816]  So then they went next level and engaged in the lawfare to try to take us off air.
[01:04:07.056 --> 01:04:08.257]  They're still in the process of that.
[01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:13.562]  You see those precedents set and then applied towards other individuals, whether it's internet censorship or now the lawfare.
[01:04:14.824 --> 01:04:28.995]  But we have been able to stay on air thanks to your undying support at InfoWarsTore.com, you telling your friends and family about the transmission, getting people to tune in, spreading the links where you can spread them, and of course shopping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:04:29.015 --> 01:04:32.117]  Now Alex is set to be back in town.
[01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:43.925]  This evening, and he's going to be up here tomorrow doing some special reports, but also cutting new sales at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:04:43.965 --> 01:04:51.690]  So as of right now, this is the last day to take advantage of up to 50% off top selling top rated supplements.

[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:47.641]  All right.
[01:05:48.762 --> 01:05:51.504]  Let me hit a couple of other stories here before the break.
[01:05:51.744 --> 01:05:56.028]  This is from Science Photo Library.
[01:05:56.809 --> 01:06:01.673]  And so the Science Photo Library has photos of babies in the womb, right?
[01:06:01.793 --> 01:06:02.734]  Babies in the womb.
[01:06:03.374 --> 01:06:07.078]  And so they have all the photos of babies in the womb because that's what they are.
[01:06:07.158 --> 01:06:12.803]  They're babies and they're in the womb and you can see their bodies and arms and fingers and phalanges and the heart beating and everything.
[01:06:14.477 --> 01:06:16.758]  And so they lie to you when they say that's not a baby, it is a baby.
[01:06:17.118 --> 01:06:27.663]  But on Science Photo Library, where you can go look at the photos of babies in the womb, very amazing images, very powerful stuff, they have a little disclaimer here.
[01:06:28.603 --> 01:06:33.425]  So here you go, okay, babies in the womb, 10 weeks, 14 weeks, you can go look at it, Science Photo Library.
[01:06:33.805 --> 01:06:35.946]  And they have a little disclaimer here, look at this!
[01:06:37.267 --> 01:06:41.148]  Not for use by pro-life or similar organizations.
[01:06:41.189 --> 01:06:41.889]  This is real!
[01:06:43.168 --> 01:06:44.089]  Folks, this is real.
[01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:46.831]  Science Photo Library.
[01:06:47.192 --> 01:06:51.095]  Not for use by pro-life or similar organizations.
[01:06:51.295 --> 01:06:53.317]  So am I not allowed to use this right now on air?
[01:06:53.557 --> 01:07:01.324]  Am I going to get sued by Science Photo Library for pointing out that you have photos of babies before they're born?
[01:07:02.445 --> 01:07:05.948]  And because I'm pro-life, I'm not allowed to look at this or share this?
[01:07:07.269 --> 01:07:07.629]  Wow!
[01:07:08.752 --> 01:07:10.092]  Now why would that be the case?
[01:07:10.433 --> 01:07:10.953]  It's sad.
[01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:13.794]  I guess Science Photo Library is pro-abortion.
[01:07:14.194 --> 01:07:15.034]  They're in the death cult.
[01:07:15.054 --> 01:07:16.115]  They like killing babies.
[01:07:16.155 --> 01:07:18.495]  They like chopping up babies for body parts and selling them.
[01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:21.596]  I guess Science Photo Library is into that.
[01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:24.517]  But here's the true story here.
[01:07:25.598 --> 01:07:28.419]  It just shows that they know what they're doing is baby murder, folks.
[01:07:29.399 --> 01:07:29.899]  They know it.
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:38.518]   Why would they put this as a disclaimer in their Baby in the womb science photo library.
[01:07:38.819 --> 01:07:41.843]  Why would they put not for use by pro-life or similar organizations?
[01:07:42.323 --> 01:07:47.730]  Because they know it's a baby in that womb and abortion is murder.
[01:07:48.451 --> 01:07:50.534]  And so they have to put this disclaimer out.
[01:07:51.175 --> 01:07:56.176]  Because they know that's the case and they have all the evidence right there in their own photo library.
[01:07:56.276 --> 01:07:56.757]  Incredible.
[01:07:57.057 --> 01:07:59.357]  But Planned Parenthood is absolutely disgusting, folks.
[01:07:59.377 --> 01:08:00.038]  This is a new one.
[01:08:00.538 --> 01:08:08.220]  A woman in New York took abortion pills as directed by Planned Parenthood and then gave birth in the bathroom to a fully formed, stillborn baby boy.
[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:12.161]  The experts estimate it was 33 to 36 weeks old.
[01:08:12.201 --> 01:08:14.782]  Planned Parenthood is being sued for its unthinkable negligence.
[01:08:16.004 --> 01:08:20.086]  Yeah, well Planned Parenthood has killed millions of babies and they get government money to do it.
[01:08:20.346 --> 01:08:21.666]  It's sick.
[01:08:21.666 --> 01:08:23.265]  Woo!
[01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:29.546]  Folks, I don't want to get out ahead of this.
[01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:32.050]  Oh boy.
[01:08:32.350 --> 01:08:32.931]  You know what?
[01:08:32.971 --> 01:08:34.811]  Let me just actually pump the brakes on this.
[01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:37.332]  Let me pump the brakes on this.
[01:08:41.094 --> 01:08:43.935]  And before... I'd rather other people break this news.
[01:08:45.615 --> 01:08:47.396]  So I'm not going to break it right now.
[01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:48.217]  It's already out there.
[01:08:50.078 --> 01:08:59.585]  So let me just pump the brakes on that and kind of give the backdrop, and then we'll see if we want to break it on this show or let others break it.
[01:08:59.625 --> 01:09:08.011]  It's already out there, but when I say break it, meaning if there's a story floating around out there and then we report on it, it gets broken wide open.
[01:09:08.091 --> 01:09:10.953]  It doesn't mean we're the original source, it's just that's how it goes.
[01:09:12.094 --> 01:09:14.736]  So I really don't want to break this right now, but let me just put it like this.
[01:09:15.638 --> 01:09:21.883]  In regards to the Pelosi home invasion, I think there are a lot of obvious questions.
[01:09:22.784 --> 01:09:27.228]  Now, if you take it at face value, then okay, fine, we condemn political violence against Nancy Pelosi.
[01:09:28.712 --> 01:09:35.560]  But there's obviously questions lingering, how does one get into the home, the multiple levels of security, the security cameras, all of it, how can this be?
[01:09:36.301 --> 01:09:39.084]  And then the ridiculous narrative that he's running around the house, where's Nancy?
[01:09:39.124 --> 01:09:39.665]  Where's Nancy?
[01:09:39.725 --> 01:09:40.486]  I'm here for Nancy!
[01:09:40.526 --> 01:09:45.511]  And then they're saying he tied up Paul Pelosi, begging for Nancy Pelosi to come home, so...
[01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:57.066]  Okay, but that is almost to the same level of, on January 6th, Nancy Pelosi having documentary film crews following her around that day.
[01:09:57.386 --> 01:10:03.347]  So, oh, it was so dangerous, she didn't send the documentary film crew home, it was so dangerous, no.
[01:10:03.888 --> 01:10:11.690]  And it was such an important day for her that she somehow knew to hire a documentary film crew so it could be used later in a legal case.
[01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:13.470]  Isn't that an incredible coincidence?
[01:10:13.530 --> 01:10:15.691]  Well, could there be something similar going on?
[01:10:16.451 --> 01:10:17.832]  I mean, that's how ridiculous it would be.
[01:10:17.872 --> 01:10:25.076]  It'd be like if there was a documentary film crew in Nancy Pelosi's house filming Paul Pelosi getting tied up and beaten with a hammer.
[01:10:26.357 --> 01:10:29.298]  I mean, that might be how ridiculous this thing gets, folks.
[01:10:29.318 --> 01:10:33.060]  But I'm going to hold off on taking that story next level.
[01:10:33.541 --> 01:10:34.721]  I really don't want to break it here.
[01:10:35.782 --> 01:10:42.526]  But let's just say the questions may be getting answered.
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:46.041]  And again, you might say, well this is so ridiculous.
[01:10:46.521 --> 01:10:51.982]  The Democrats wouldn't false flag themselves to this extent with 11 days left to the midterms.
[01:10:52.182 --> 01:10:52.542]  Really?
[01:10:52.603 --> 01:10:53.063]  They wouldn't?
[01:10:54.143 --> 01:11:02.925]  Did you see Nancy Pelosi's documentary film crew following her around on January 6th and they released the footage right ahead of the midterm elections during the January 6th hearings?
[01:11:02.945 --> 01:11:04.806]  You really don't think that's what would be going on?
[01:11:06.838 --> 01:11:12.243]  Yeah, I think they might just be that desperate, and they might be acting in that much desperation.
[01:11:12.944 --> 01:11:16.167]  And, you know, this is how God works, and this is how demons work.
[01:11:16.227 --> 01:11:19.050]  Demons cannot help but overexpose themselves eventually.
[01:11:19.971 --> 01:11:27.098]  Now, let me get back to this January 6 news that I think is extremely important here, and I'm going to revisit this later.
[01:11:30.487 --> 01:11:32.349]  Ali Alexander wrote this for the Gateway Pundit.
[01:11:32.369 --> 01:11:33.410]  He joins me in the next hour.
[01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:34.431]  Pelosi cover-up.
[01:11:34.831 --> 01:11:38.274]  Now we know why Democrats lied about Trump's National Guard offer.
[01:11:38.314 --> 01:11:42.377]  Now this is an incredible development that is an ongoing development here where...
[01:11:43.695 --> 01:11:47.436]  All the receipts are available, folks, so you don't need to worry about hearsay here.
[01:11:48.396 --> 01:11:59.180]  The receipts are available, the phone calls, all of it, where Donald Trump and the White House were asking for added security from the D.C.
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:03.861]  police in the mayor's office and from the National Guard with Nancy Pelosi.
[01:12:04.041 --> 01:12:05.762]  It's on record.
[01:12:06.702 --> 01:12:09.723]  There are proof of receipts there.
[01:12:11.348 --> 01:12:25.698]  So when the Democrats come out and say, Trump stood down the National Guard, Trump stood down the police, he wanted there to be activities that day, it's a blatant lie provable with hardcore evidence that we already have access to.
[01:12:25.958 --> 01:12:28.219]  So why are they continuing to push that lie?
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.261]  We're going to get into that later with Ali Alexander.
[01:12:31.682 --> 01:12:39.347]  Now here's the real big story that I see in regards to January 6th that most people are missing.
[01:12:40.598 --> 01:12:42.480]  This is from Politico, of course.
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:48.104]  January 6th, Ryder gets probation, not prison, after judge finds autism played a role.
[01:12:48.144 --> 01:12:51.427]  Now, let me try to encapsulate this for you.
[01:12:51.947 --> 01:13:27.307]   So, one of the individuals, you've probably seen him in images, next to the QAnon shaman, and he's got kind of longer hair, and he was in the building that day, he was walking around next to the QAnon shaman, and his name is Nicholas Rodian, And so Judge Trevor McFadden has said that Asperger's or autism or he's somewhere on the spectrum there caused him to be more susceptible into falling into this trap and therefore he shouldn't get prison time and instead gets five years of probation and his family was there
[01:13:27.606 --> 01:13:31.386]   Arguing on his behalf if you will he just started a dog walking service
[01:13:31.386 --> 01:13:34.905]   It's actually kind of a it actually seems like a really wholesome guy really nice guy
[01:13:34.905 --> 01:13:40.067]   You know perhaps as autism or Asperger's But you know works on his own probably we all know somebody
[01:13:40.067 --> 01:13:42.626]   like that in life that some of the nice nicest people we ever meet
[01:13:42.626 --> 01:13:52.067]   but very naive very susceptible very trusting and So this particular individual was talking about how he was
[01:13:52.067 --> 01:13:57.805]   getting secret information and documents directly from QAnon
[01:13:57.805 --> 01:14:04.806]   Who was giving him directives to share it and to take action upon it like getting on his YouTube channel and
[01:14:04.806 --> 01:14:15.766]   talking about it [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:14:06.789 --> 01:14:19.118]  Now most people are unaware of this because I'd never seen his YouTube channel, you'd never seen his YouTube channel, you've just seen the pictures of him walking around next to Q Anon Shaman that day.
[01:14:20.799 --> 01:14:23.121]  So folks, are you starting to get the picture here?
[01:14:24.402 --> 01:14:44.807]   So an individual with autism is getting secret documents and information from Q Anon Or government sources or military sources and then he goes out on January 6th and goes in the building thinking he's on a mission from QAnon.
[01:14:46.248 --> 01:14:49.150]  Are you starting to see where I'm going with this yet?
[01:14:50.651 --> 01:14:56.296]  Well, let's recall what happened in the fake plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer.
[01:14:57.196 --> 01:14:58.497]  What did the FBI do?
[01:14:59.423 --> 01:15:29.273]   They targeted single, lonely men who might be on some sort of autism, mental illness spectrum, who are susceptible and naive, and communicated with them via the internet and text, and convinced them and swayed them Into joining, what they later would find out, FBI agents in a plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer.
[01:15:30.714 --> 01:15:34.355]  So this is what the FBI has been caught doing numerous times now.
[01:15:35.635 --> 01:15:36.696]  They set up a plot.
[01:15:37.016 --> 01:15:38.816]  We'll use the plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer.
[01:15:38.976 --> 01:15:44.258]  FBI agents set up a plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer as a trap, an entrapment operation.
[01:15:44.738 --> 01:16:09.936]   They then go out and find individuals, men particularly, That are easily susceptible to propaganda, specifically ones that might have a mental illness or autism, and then they entrap them in these crimes to say CX group is violent and terroristic because they wanted to kidnap the governor of Michigan.
[01:16:10.116 --> 01:16:11.997]  And of course the feds did it the whole time.
[01:16:13.052 --> 01:16:19.775]  The feds entrapped innocent men so that they could have a political stunt to say that Trump supporters are violent.
[01:16:19.815 --> 01:16:23.076]  See, they tried to kidnap Governor Whitmer when it was the FBI the entire time.
[01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:25.458]  And so that all comes out.
[01:16:26.518 --> 01:16:33.761]  Folks, this case of Nicholas Rodian, I think, is now the skeleton key.
[01:16:35.622 --> 01:16:41.825]  If it's not Ray Epps, if it's not the pipe bomber, it's Nicholas Rodian.
[01:16:44.264 --> 01:17:00.917]  Based off what I can tell from this story, it sounds like Nicolas Rodin was contacted by Feds, posing as QAnon, convincing him what they were doing was real, convincing him to be a part of this movement, much like the QAnon Shaman and other similar people.
[01:17:02.216 --> 01:17:19.909]  Getting communicated with Feds, telling them this is all going on, they're getting top secret classified information, they've been selected for this special mission, just like the plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer, and then they end up in court, they end up going to jail, and the narrative ends up getting spun that they were terrorists the whole time when they were entrapped by the FBI.
[01:17:20.529 --> 01:17:22.391]  Folks, this is not a minor story.
[01:17:23.786 --> 01:17:28.910]  To me, this is now the third loose thread hanging from the sweater on the January 6th narrative.
[01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:37.436]  So you now have Ray Epps, the pipe bomber, who there's about to be massive news breaking from Darren Beatty in the next couple of days, by the way.
[01:17:37.496 --> 01:17:38.537]  Keep your eyes peeled for that.
[01:17:39.137 --> 01:17:40.718]  And now, Nicholas Rodin.
[01:17:40.738 --> 01:17:42.800]  But I've noticed not many people have picked up on this yet.
[01:17:44.403 --> 01:17:52.810]  So, now though, I'm covering it, and I'm going to contact some of the other people covering this, and we're going to look more into this, because I think we've got another loose thread here.
[01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:57.514]  Alright, I was hesitant to get into this in the last segment, but I'll go ahead and break into this now.
[01:17:58.935 --> 01:18:00.497]  But, folks, here's the thing.
[01:18:00.537 --> 01:18:07.322]  The constellation on this story is expansive, and it's not concentrated here.
[01:18:08.716 --> 01:18:14.021]  So I'm kind of having to bounce around here to connect the dots, but it's all connected.
[01:18:14.081 --> 01:18:23.129]  January 6th, Pelosi standing down security, the lies about that, and yes, the home invasion at Pelosi's house now.
[01:18:25.150 --> 01:18:29.314]  But it is now known, the suspect is now known.
[01:18:30.055 --> 01:18:38.832]   By the way, why is Nancy Pelosi's son-in-law, Michael Voss, pictured next to the QAnon shaman on January 6th.
[01:18:39.032 --> 01:18:39.633]  Why is that?
[01:18:40.974 --> 01:18:42.316]  Is that what I have in my hand here?
[01:18:44.077 --> 01:18:44.478]  Ah, well.
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:51.105]  So, Pelosi has a film crew out there, her son-in-law is out there, but, uh, you know.
[01:18:52.833 --> 01:18:53.653]  Nothing to see here.
[01:18:53.754 --> 01:19:04.539]  And then the big Nicholas Rodin story where he's talking about he's getting secret information from QAnon and government sources and then he's confused in the court trial and he says, well, I don't understand.
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:11.163]  I watched riots in America for the entire 2020 year and then I saw January 6 and I didn't think it was a big deal.
[01:19:11.203 --> 01:19:12.124]  We watched cities burn.
[01:19:13.106 --> 01:19:14.446]  This all came out in that court case.
[01:19:15.046 --> 01:19:22.448]  But, okay, we now officially know, it's now official news, it's been published, we now know the suspect of the Pelosi home invasion.
[01:19:23.409 --> 01:19:27.349]  So, but ask yourself this, before I reveal the individual here.
[01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:29.610]  Ask yourself this.
[01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:36.652]  Why have you not seen a name or an image of the home invasion suspect yet today?
[01:19:37.292 --> 01:19:37.572]  Why?
[01:19:39.099 --> 01:19:40.080]  You know why, don't you?
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:41.600]  Because it wasn't a Trump supporter.
[01:19:42.201 --> 01:19:43.281]  It wasn't a conservative.
[01:19:43.982 --> 01:19:46.143]  If it was, they would have already blasted the individual.
[01:19:46.183 --> 01:19:46.783]  It wasn't!
[01:19:47.604 --> 01:19:48.924]  Now we know who it was.
[01:19:49.045 --> 01:19:50.385]  David DePape.
[01:19:51.066 --> 01:19:52.346]  Paul Pelosi suspect.
[01:19:52.667 --> 01:19:56.489]  Five facts you need to know from heavy.com.
[01:19:59.110 --> 01:20:00.351]  Let's see what we have here.
[01:20:01.069 --> 01:20:11.057]  David DePappe is a former Fidel Castro nudist protester and hemp jewelry maker who has children with a well-known pro-nudity activist.
[01:20:11.377 --> 01:20:14.179]  In other words, he's a leftist activist.
[01:20:17.782 --> 01:20:18.803]  Berkeley, California.
[01:20:19.583 --> 01:20:23.186]  David DePappe wrote a blog called Welcome to Big Brother's Censorship Hell.
[01:20:23.426 --> 01:20:23.546]  Oh.
[01:20:25.027 --> 01:20:25.508]  Interesting.
[01:20:28.683 --> 01:20:32.864]  David DePappy entered the Pelosi home through a sliding glass door looking for Pelosi reports.
[01:20:32.884 --> 01:20:34.025]  Say, how did he get in?
[01:20:34.045 --> 01:20:40.247]  I mean, again, I'm not going to sit here and act like the Pelosi's can't make mistakes or security systems don't have errors.
[01:20:40.287 --> 01:20:44.448]  But I mean, seriously, that is amazing that he was able to get into the home.
[01:20:44.488 --> 01:20:45.209]  That's the real question.
[01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:46.789]  How does he get into the house?
[01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:48.930]  He must have known where he was going.
[01:20:51.251 --> 01:20:54.592]  Paul Pelosi was taken to the hospital.
[01:20:56.645 --> 01:21:21.620]  Pelosi is of course worth hundreds of millions of dollars and I believe it's also going to come out, I don't see it in this story, but I believe it will also come out that this individual, DiPapi, has been involved in other protests, specifically protests at Pelosi's house where they put a dead pig head out on her lawn.
[01:21:22.987 --> 01:21:26.928]  So this is a leftist protester from Berkeley, California, who did it.
[01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:33.110]  So they're going to try to bury this story as fast as they made a big fuss about it, because it is not a Trump supporter.
[01:21:33.130 --> 01:21:37.612]  Now, you can go on to... I don't know about the TV, definitely with the internet.
[01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:43.454]  The TV liberal propagandists are a little smarter than your average liberal propagandist on Twitter, meaning...
[01:21:44.824 --> 01:21:49.467]  When they find out the truth about a story, which they will, they will bury it.
[01:21:49.867 --> 01:21:56.392]  Whereas the morons on Twitter who live with their heads up their rear ends, they don't know the truth if it smacked them right in the face.
[01:21:56.732 --> 01:22:03.356]  So they're going to continue to promote the false narrative that it was a Trump-supporting conservative that broke into Pelosi's house.
[01:22:03.557 --> 01:22:14.484]  In fact, you could probably go onto Twitter right now, find all the same Democrat propaganda accounts still saying that this was a conservative Trump supporter that went into the Pelosi house, even though we now know the suspect and know it wasn't.
[01:22:15.024 --> 01:22:16.645]  They will still promote that lie.
[01:22:16.925 --> 01:22:17.765]  That's what they do.
[01:22:19.186 --> 01:22:22.267]  So, more is going to develop on this, but now we know the question.
[01:22:22.728 --> 01:22:25.609]  Why didn't we get the identity of this individual sooner?
[01:22:25.929 --> 01:22:29.831]  Why didn't we see images and information about the home invader sooner?
[01:22:30.091 --> 01:22:32.512]  Because he wasn't a conservative Trump supporter.
[01:22:32.752 --> 01:22:33.312]  That's why.
[01:22:33.593 --> 01:22:34.393]  And now you know.
[01:22:35.673 --> 01:22:36.434]  And now you know.
[01:22:37.605 --> 01:22:45.635]  The only thing that was missing was a documentary film crew there to catch the whole thing that Nancy Pelosi hired, just like on January 6th.
[01:22:47.631 --> 01:22:47.971]  Yep.
[01:22:48.251 --> 01:22:49.032]  And so here it is.
[01:22:49.392 --> 01:22:51.434]  See the crew's already pulled it up.
[01:22:51.914 --> 01:23:00.220]  You log right into Twitter right now and you will find Democrat Party propaganda accounts still blaming Trump and Trump supporters.
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:00.940]  Here's one right here.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.602]  This was just tweeted a minute ago.
[01:23:03.402 --> 01:23:06.024]  Folks, the heavy story came out about 30 minutes ago.
[01:23:06.104 --> 01:23:09.887]  So the identity has been known for at least an hour to anybody who's looked into it.
[01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:14.291]  Just a listener of the show sent this information to me.
[01:23:14.591 --> 01:23:19.434]  And that's why when I first got it, I was like, hey, I'm gonna wait and do a little verification here, but okay, we've got the verification now.
[01:23:20.694 --> 01:23:35.081]  So they're still tweeting out, at this moment, liberal Democrats are still tweeting out, blaming Donald Trump and Republicans for the Pelosi home invasion, even though we now have the suspect, and know who he is, and he's a leftist.
[01:23:38.663 --> 01:23:39.103]  They're sick!
[01:23:40.464 --> 01:23:43.585]  They are sick, sick people.
[01:23:44.626 --> 01:23:45.446]  But of course they are.
[01:23:46.847 --> 01:23:50.288]  Because they write stories like this in Newsweek.
[01:23:50.368 --> 01:23:52.889]  Yeah, I mean, you guys can pull these up all day long if you want.
[01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:55.931]  These are all tweets within the last five minutes.
[01:23:57.128 --> 01:23:59.788]  We've known the identity of the suspect for at least an hour.
[01:24:00.409 --> 01:24:05.069]  Mainstream news now has published the identity of the suspect for at least the last half hour.
[01:24:05.529 --> 01:24:12.831]  And liberals on Twitter are still tweeting out in this very moment, in this minute, that it was Trump and Trump supporters that did this.
[01:24:15.631 --> 01:24:19.052]  And they won't even know that the information is already out there and that they're wrong.
[01:24:19.632 --> 01:24:23.553]  So, I mean, the crew can pull these up as long as they'd like when I'm covering this other news here.
[01:24:23.773 --> 01:24:24.973]  Because I think it's important to show that.
[01:24:25.839 --> 01:24:27.521]  Reality doesn't matter to these people.
[01:24:28.082 --> 01:24:29.624]  Truth doesn't matter to these people.
[01:24:30.224 --> 01:24:34.610]  It's the political propaganda and the political agenda first and everything until last.
[01:24:34.650 --> 01:24:35.010]  That's it.
[01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:35.631]  That's all they have.
[01:24:35.891 --> 01:24:36.953]  It's their religion.
[01:24:39.856 --> 01:24:41.118]  Here's an example from Newsweek.
[01:24:41.198 --> 01:24:41.738]  Fact check.
[01:24:42.645 --> 01:24:45.007]  Ted Cruz's claim that Antifa burnt U.S.
[01:24:45.027 --> 01:24:45.967]  cities for a year.
[01:24:46.067 --> 01:24:53.312]  So remember, Ted Cruz goes on The View, says, how are you going to talk about January 6th and not talk about the BLM-Antifa riots from the summer of 2020?
[01:24:53.432 --> 01:24:55.253]  And they say, that didn't even happen.
[01:24:56.114 --> 01:24:58.015]  But this is even crazier on Newsweek.
[01:24:58.996 --> 01:24:59.556]  Fact check.
[01:24:59.596 --> 01:25:02.038]  Ted Cruz's claim that Antifa burnt U.S.
[01:25:02.058 --> 01:25:02.958]  cities for a year.
[01:25:03.018 --> 01:25:04.339]  Now, I'll do this here.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:06.100]  You can doc him this.
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:06.641]  So, OK.
[01:25:06.841 --> 01:25:08.662]  Oh, I have the Newsweek story right in front of me.
[01:25:09.843 --> 01:25:09.963]  OK.
[01:25:11.328 --> 01:25:12.109]  So let's find out.
[01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.869]  Fact check.
[01:25:13.230 --> 01:25:13.870]  Is it true?
[01:25:14.010 --> 01:25:16.052]  Ted Cruz's claim that Antifa burnt U.S.
[01:25:16.072 --> 01:25:16.893]  cities for a year.
[01:25:17.433 --> 01:25:21.337]  Now, Newsweek has to do a fact check on this, as if we don't know the answer.
[01:25:21.537 --> 01:25:22.077]  Now get this.
[01:25:22.518 --> 01:25:31.766]  Right out of the gates, in their own story, they have images of Antifa and BLM burning cities to the ground in the year 2020.
[01:25:32.386 --> 01:25:33.267]  It's in the story.
[01:25:33.727 --> 01:25:35.029]  Literally, the images of it.
[01:25:36.075 --> 01:25:37.496]  And they say they're doing a fact check!
[01:25:38.096 --> 01:25:40.237]  So I can scroll through, I can flip through the story.
[01:25:40.518 --> 01:25:42.979]  Oh, picture of leftist burning cities in the summer of 2020.
[01:25:43.079 --> 01:25:45.380]  Okay, okay, fact checking Ted Cruz.
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:47.281]  Oh, here's pictures of Democrats burning cities.
[01:25:47.621 --> 01:25:48.022]  Fact check.
[01:25:48.302 --> 01:25:49.222]  And then what does it say?
[01:25:49.462 --> 01:25:49.903]  False!
[01:25:50.743 --> 01:25:51.624]  It says false!
[01:25:53.505 --> 01:25:54.345]  Look at this!
[01:25:55.306 --> 01:25:56.346]  It says false!
[01:25:59.188 --> 01:26:00.689]  Oh, unbelievable.
[01:26:01.798 --> 01:26:15.982]  So they show you the pictures and the images of Liberal Democrats burning cities to the ground in the summer of 2020 in the very story where they claim Ted Cruz is saying that Liberal Democrats burn cities to the ground and that's false.
[01:26:16.162 --> 01:26:21.863]  And then they show you the images of the actual facts and evidence and then they still say it's false.
[01:26:23.464 --> 01:26:24.464]  Incredible.
[01:26:26.098 --> 01:26:28.279]  Newsweek fact-checks Ted Cruz.
[01:26:28.599 --> 01:26:32.480]  Did BLM and Antifa burn cities in the United States in the year of 2020?
[01:26:33.801 --> 01:26:42.524]  And they show the images in the story of liberals doing just that and they still say Ted Cruz is false after showing you the evidence that it's true.
[01:26:43.504 --> 01:26:46.525]  Can it get any crazier than that?
[01:26:48.245 --> 01:26:57.363]   Well perhaps if you're one of the victims of these deranged fascists and authoritarians like Paul Manafort.
[01:26:57.623 --> 01:27:05.692]  Andrew Weisman placed Paul Manafort in solitary confinement for 11 months in an effort to get him to lie about Donald Trump.
[01:27:06.616 --> 01:27:07.696]  You know, this is really sad.
[01:27:07.756 --> 01:27:08.276]  Here's another one.
[01:27:08.296 --> 01:27:13.498]  Weissman and the Mueller gang made up charges against 11 mystery Russians in an effort to claim Russia hacked the DNC.
[01:27:13.538 --> 01:27:14.138]  It was all a lie.
[01:27:14.378 --> 01:27:20.920]  Yeah, remember, they made those claims about these Russians and expected that the Russians wouldn't show up to court.
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:25.041]  The Russians actually showed up to court and wanted to defend themselves.
[01:27:25.361 --> 01:27:29.342]  And Mueller and the Democrats said, nope, never mind, we're dropping the charges.
[01:27:29.402 --> 01:27:29.862]  You remember that?
[01:27:30.930 --> 01:27:31.350]  Remember that?
[01:27:31.930 --> 01:27:36.251]  They wrote, oh, look at these Russians that hacked the DNC and they filed a lawsuit.
[01:27:36.471 --> 01:27:43.793]  The Russians showed up in court with a lawyer and the Mueller team and the Democrats said, never mind, never mind, we don't want to try this case.
[01:27:45.914 --> 01:27:52.015]  Email released in Danchenko case proves Obama and his deep state lied and set up President Trump in an attempt to remove him from office.
[01:27:52.035 --> 01:27:52.855]  Yeah, we have all the evidence.
[01:27:53.195 --> 01:27:54.516]  But see, this is what's so sick.
[01:27:54.556 --> 01:27:59.057]  And I, you know, here's the one thing about Donald Trump that actually I think is even more important than the vaccine deal.
[01:28:00.854 --> 01:28:03.596]  Donald, people have suffered so much for this man.
[01:28:03.956 --> 01:28:08.539]  People have suffered so much in support of Donald Trump, myself included, but not the worst of it for me.
[01:28:08.919 --> 01:28:13.402]  People in jail, rotting in jail, solitary confinement, in their support for this man.
[01:28:13.782 --> 01:28:14.563]  He owes them.
[01:28:14.943 --> 01:28:16.264]  He owes them so much.
[01:28:16.464 --> 01:28:17.965]  I don't know how he's going to pay it back.
[01:28:19.006 --> 01:28:20.307]  So of course you're a bigot.
[01:28:21.255 --> 01:28:30.330]  If you believe that men would dress up as women to get access to children because they're perverts, if you think that, you're a transphobe and obviously a bigot.
[01:28:30.591 --> 01:28:32.975]  And there's no evidence to support that theory, by the way.
[01:28:33.496 --> 01:28:34.056]  Oh wait, what's this?
[01:28:36.223 --> 01:28:39.706]  Here's the Berkshire Police in England.
[01:28:40.346 --> 01:28:41.547]  Recognize this person?
[01:28:41.567 --> 01:28:47.111]  We're investigating an incident at the Thiel station and releasing CCTV images in connection.
[01:28:47.632 --> 01:28:52.735]  A person exposed their genitals to two teenagers and masturbated in a station shelter.
[01:28:53.556 --> 01:28:57.259]  And of course it's a man dressed like a woman!
[01:28:58.851 --> 01:29:08.103]  Now tell me, why would a man dress like a woman to go masturbate to teenagers at a train station shelter?
[01:29:08.223 --> 01:29:09.505]  Why would he do that?
[01:29:09.826 --> 01:29:15.773]  Oh, I know why, because he knows if he does that dressed as a woman, you're a bigot if you say anything about it.
[01:29:16.724 --> 01:29:26.430]  So, if you're a pedophile, that's obviously frowned upon and bad, but if you're a transgender pedophile, that is all good baby, baby.
[01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:30.332]  CCTV images released after indecent exposure.
[01:29:30.413 --> 01:29:40.139]  So, man dresses as a woman, masturbates to kids at a train station, but don't dare call him a pervert because that's a transgender person.
[01:29:40.579 --> 01:29:41.820]  You bigot.
[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:43.781]  Now, this is really just sick stuff here.
[01:29:45.205 --> 01:29:48.807]  I wasn't going to cover this, but then I saw two stories, and so somebody's got to mention this.
[01:29:48.827 --> 01:29:49.828]  This is just out of control.
[01:29:51.089 --> 01:30:02.775]  So, it was an opinion piece originally that got syndicated on a bunch of news platforms, and it made the New York Post, and that's where I saw it, and I was going to just discount it, but then there was a follow-up, and I was like, okay, I'll cover it now.
[01:30:03.996 --> 01:30:08.159]  Nadia Bokadi, why no nut November needs to stop.
[01:30:09.096 --> 01:30:19.283]  And there's this thing called No Nut November that it's mostly for men and it's this promotion to stop watching porn and stop masturbating and that's a good health thing.
[01:30:19.363 --> 01:30:21.184]  It's a good mental health thing, physical health thing.
[01:30:22.125 --> 01:30:31.471]  So it's a trend that happens in November for men and this blogger, I assume it's a woman, I don't think it's a transgender but whatever, I don't know about the blogger.
[01:30:31.491 --> 01:30:32.952]  So the blogger says, oh it's bad.
[01:30:34.033 --> 01:30:35.794]  It's bad to shame people for masturbating.
[01:30:35.834 --> 01:30:37.415]  It's bad to shame people for watching porn.
[01:30:37.435 --> 01:30:38.155]  It's actually healthy.
[01:30:38.175 --> 01:30:38.795]  It's actually good.
[01:30:39.696 --> 01:30:40.116]  Okay, fine.
[01:30:40.156 --> 01:30:41.116]  You can believe that.
[01:30:41.276 --> 01:30:42.157]  I don't believe that.
[01:30:43.337 --> 01:30:52.641]  And then, and then, and then, even goes as far as to blame Christianity saying, oh, it's propaganda.
[01:30:52.761 --> 01:30:58.144]  It's a psy-op that you think watching porn or masturbating is a bad thing or a sinful act.
[01:30:58.524 --> 01:30:59.644]  That's not real.
[01:30:59.744 --> 01:31:01.245]  That's just programmed into your head.
[01:31:01.545 --> 01:31:02.005]  And so, you know what?
[01:31:02.145 --> 01:31:11.699]   Even if I would accept that, And you wanted to make the debate that watching porn and masturbating was not a degenerate act, which is just a ridiculous argument, but fine.
[01:31:12.479 --> 01:31:13.079]  You know what then?
[01:31:13.099 --> 01:31:14.600]  I would say, good!
[01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:28.502]  I'm glad that my parents raised me with enough dignity to know that watching porn and masturbating is a despicable, degenerative act, and I should be ashamed of myself if I do it.
[01:31:28.942 --> 01:31:29.582]  So you know what?
[01:31:30.022 --> 01:31:30.423]  Good!
[01:31:30.763 --> 01:31:32.863]  Count that as a win for Christianity.
[01:31:34.192 --> 01:31:35.553]  But here's why I had to cover this.
[01:31:35.713 --> 01:31:37.915]  Then I turned the page, and there's this!
[01:31:39.556 --> 01:31:43.559]  Priests and nuns watch porn online too, says Pope Francis.
[01:31:43.759 --> 01:31:45.040]  They just want you to be a pervert!
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:46.280]  They want you to watch porn!
[01:31:46.441 --> 01:31:47.781]  They want you to be a sex addict!
[01:31:47.922 --> 01:31:49.323]  They want you to be a porn addict!
[01:31:50.323 --> 01:31:52.365]  So no, I'm glad I was raised Christian.
[01:31:52.445 --> 01:31:53.606]  I'm glad I read the Bible.
[01:31:53.686 --> 01:31:55.687]  I'm glad I was told it's a degenerative act.
[01:31:56.187 --> 01:31:57.288]  I'm glad I was shamed.
[01:32:00.970 --> 01:32:03.271]  Thinking, yeah, if you masturbate and watch porn, you should be ashamed.
[01:32:03.491 --> 01:32:05.032]  I'm glad I was raised that way.
[01:32:05.352 --> 01:32:06.613]  Call it Christian bigotry.
[01:32:06.993 --> 01:32:07.453]  Good!
[01:32:07.473 --> 01:32:09.214]  But see, here's all the stories.
[01:32:09.234 --> 01:32:09.895]  They have them all pulled out.
[01:32:09.915 --> 01:32:10.615]  Oh, porn's good for you.
[01:32:10.895 --> 01:32:11.636]  No, it's not!
[01:32:12.396 --> 01:32:17.238]  It's just as addicting as any other drug, and it's horrible for you, and you should be ashamed of yourself.
[01:32:17.479 --> 01:32:22.021]  You think your ancestors sitting around watching you, uh, touch yourself is a good thing?
[01:32:22.641 --> 01:32:23.622]  You should be embarrassed!
[01:32:24.758 --> 01:32:27.621]  But see, it all comes back to the trans stuff, folks.
[01:32:28.141 --> 01:32:29.022]  NHS warning.
[01:32:29.442 --> 01:32:31.504]  Many trans kids merely going through a phase.
[01:32:31.644 --> 01:32:32.445]  Well, that doesn't matter.
[01:32:32.545 --> 01:32:33.165]  Chop them up!
[01:32:33.646 --> 01:32:35.127]  So that it's a permanent thing!
[01:32:36.208 --> 01:32:39.271]  Another disturbing all-ages drag show caught on camera.
[01:32:39.311 --> 01:32:42.874]  Yeah, see, they want you and your children to be addicted to porn.
[01:32:44.218 --> 01:32:48.500]  And then when you try to say, hey, you shouldn't do that, that's bad.
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:50.741]  Oh, you're a Christian bigot.
[01:32:50.801 --> 01:32:52.542]  Don't shame them for doing that.
[01:32:52.602 --> 01:32:53.102]  It's fine.
[01:32:53.162 --> 01:32:53.502]  It's good.
[01:32:53.542 --> 01:32:54.402]  It's actually healthy.
[01:32:54.863 --> 01:32:55.963]  No, it's not.
[01:32:56.323 --> 01:32:57.544]  Stop lying to children.
[01:32:57.644 --> 01:32:59.125]  Stop sexualizing children.
[01:32:59.305 --> 01:33:02.305]  You are despicable beasts for promoting this activity.
[01:33:02.305 --> 01:33:08.305]  [Music]
[01:33:08.305 --> 01:33:12.305]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[01:33:12.674 --> 01:33:15.337]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[01:33:15.797 --> 01:33:16.598]  Now, I knew that.

[01:34:11.823 --> 01:34:20.483]   Ali Alexander had it because earlier this week He reported that Elon Musk would take over by Friday and
[01:34:20.483 --> 01:34:24.949]   make all the executive firings Here is Ali Alexander.
[01:34:25.249 --> 01:34:27.869]  Earlier this week, before everyone else, he had the story.
[01:34:27.929 --> 01:34:28.309]  Here it is.
[01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:29.450]  I'm going to tell you this.
[01:34:30.130 --> 01:34:35.471]  As sure as I'm sitting here now, they're not going to stop Elon Musk from acquiring Twitter.
[01:34:35.711 --> 01:34:40.392]  We are going to expose to the world the PsyOps information game that has gone on.
[01:34:40.672 --> 01:34:51.896]   The deal will close this week as I was the first person in the country Let me go ahead and break news.
[01:34:52.417 --> 01:34:56.139]  Let me break news that not even the Wall Street Journal or Business Insider has.
[01:34:56.419 --> 01:34:58.840]  Let me break news on the Stone Zone.
[01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:05.764]  I can announce exclusively that Elon Musk plans to serve as the CEO of Twitter.
[01:35:06.104 --> 01:35:09.966]  He will not just be running it as its major owner.
[01:35:10.346 --> 01:35:19.058]   No, and there is an investment group that is investing alongside Elon Musk plans to take the helm himself.
[01:35:19.278 --> 01:35:21.359]  He's staring down the Biden administration.
[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:23.041]  He's staring down the Marxists.
[01:35:23.281 --> 01:35:28.785]  He's staring down the pedophiles, the Satanists, and everybody else opposed to him.
[01:35:29.146 --> 01:35:36.792]  And Elon Musk, Ali Alexander, is exclusively reporting on the Stone Zone, will serve as its CEO.
[01:35:37.032 --> 01:35:47.771]   He'll be CEO of three companies, and you can bet your butt That the Biden administration will then come after him, but only after he's taken the helm and we're going to clean house.
[01:35:48.192 --> 01:35:49.736]  And by we, I just mean free thinkers.
[01:35:50.956 --> 01:35:53.018]  So there it is, folks.
[01:35:53.858 --> 01:35:55.840]  Tomorrow's news today from Ali Alexander.
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:58.863]  And by the way, they have gone after Elon Musk.
[01:35:58.883 --> 01:36:00.724]  He's got multiple probes into him.
[01:36:00.744 --> 01:36:02.346]  He's got probes into Tesla.
[01:36:02.646 --> 01:36:04.387]  So they are coming after him with the government.
[01:36:04.427 --> 01:36:06.829]  But just like Donald Trump, he's clean.
[01:36:06.889 --> 01:36:07.710]  There's nothing there.
[01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:10.092]  And he's a lot less controversial and hated than Donald Trump.
[01:36:10.112 --> 01:36:12.634]  So there's not many teeth to those investigations.
[01:36:12.674 --> 01:36:16.638]  But they are going after Elon Musk now as well with the deep state.
[01:36:16.678 --> 01:36:18.960]  So Ali Alexander joins me live now here.
[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:21.162]  On the Alex Jones Show.
[01:36:21.202 --> 01:36:27.247]  Ali, let me just let you kind of take the helm here with the news breaking today.
[01:36:27.588 --> 01:36:29.830]  You had it earlier this week, but now the news is out.
[01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:31.431]  Elon Musk takes over Twitter.
[01:36:32.012 --> 01:36:32.973]  A bunch of questions.
[01:36:33.313 --> 01:36:35.395]  When will the censorship be relinquished?
[01:36:35.475 --> 01:36:40.280]  When will people like Donald Trump, Alex Jones, Ali Alexander, myself and others get their accounts back?
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:51.271]  What is it like over there now with 75% of the staff getting fired, including the two big executives that clearly have no American values in their principles, in their heart, and their souls?
[01:36:51.932 --> 01:36:53.333]  Ali Alexander, you broke the news first.
[01:36:53.353 --> 01:36:54.174]  What do you have for us today?
[01:36:55.555 --> 01:36:59.279]  You know, well first I want to say, Owen, today you're running a hell of a show.
[01:36:59.579 --> 01:37:10.471]  I just watched the past half hour and it's amazing to watch you break the news, make the news, teach people how to analyze the news, and I think that that's what we're doing here now together.
[01:37:10.531 --> 01:37:21.839]   But, you know, I think that, look, I think that Alex and you and I, we've approached this issue where we've seen Elon Musk as an ally, as somebody who wants to restore the public square.
[01:37:21.859 --> 01:37:30.244]  And you and I also know that, you know, we're better at debating our enemies and battling our enemies in the public square than our opponents are.
[01:37:30.284 --> 01:37:37.368]  You know, we're not with Elon with the electric vehicles, we're not with Elon on the transhumanism, but we do need this hero.
[01:37:37.408 --> 01:37:38.349]  The question is begged.
[01:37:38.789 --> 01:37:48.412]  Why wasn't there a right-wing billionaire who came in and bought the New York Times or bought the Washington Post or bought Twitter or saved us from Facebook censorship?
[01:37:48.752 --> 01:37:56.034]  What we've got to do is have a coalition, frankly, of the willing, and that includes Ye, that includes Elon Musk and anybody else.
[01:37:56.594 --> 01:38:06.564]  Who wants a more normal America and so you know I've got sources embedded in Twitter and in around Elon and all of the stuff I'm hearing is really good.
[01:38:07.005 --> 01:38:12.844]   What I'm hearing is that they don't have a formal process to reverse the permanent suspensions,
[01:38:12.844 --> 01:38:17.965]   but Elon himself has made that one of his top three priorities.
[01:38:17.965 --> 01:38:20.404]  His investors are on board with this.
[01:38:20.404 --> 01:38:23.164]  They're ready for troubled storms.
[01:38:23.164 --> 01:38:24.844]  There are investors at SpaceX.
[01:38:24.844 --> 01:38:29.484]   There are investors at Tesla that know that they're going to have to pay the price for
[01:38:29.484 --> 01:38:33.925]  Elon's political bravery, frankly, at Twitter.
[01:38:33.925 --> 01:38:34.925]  This isn't about money.
[01:38:34.925 --> 01:38:43.164]   I really hate to see some of the dumb analysis when people say, "Oh, certainly Elon is taking
[01:38:43.164 --> 01:38:48.764]   Twitter private and could make a couple multiples of his investment."
[01:38:49.021 --> 01:38:51.381]  That's not usually why you're investing this much money.
[01:38:51.381 --> 01:38:54.421]   When you're investing this much money, you know, you wanna 10X your money,
[01:38:54.421 --> 01:38:55.900]  you wanna do something more.
[01:38:55.900 --> 01:39:00.742]   There's no opportunity with taking Twitter private and then putting it back on the public market
[01:39:00.742 --> 01:39:02.280]  maybe in three to five years.
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:04.261]  There's no opportunity to make that much money.
[01:39:04.261 --> 01:39:07.381]  So this is a headache, this is a sacrifice.
[01:39:07.381 --> 01:39:10.740]  It's going to hurt other businesses he owns.
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:18.301]   And quite frankly, the SEC wasn't against Elon as much as they should have been or could have been
[01:39:18.301 --> 01:39:22.381]   during the Trump administration because Trump was busy pumping up the market.
[01:39:22.381 --> 01:39:24.542]  And so now we're in a different environment.
[01:39:24.542 --> 01:39:32.060]   It is, Elon is taking a lot more risk on behalf of putting us all on and taking all of the heat.
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:33.822]  And frankly, I can't wait.
[01:39:33.822 --> 01:39:40.261]   I can't wait till we actually see a demand market, a demand-based market on the right
[01:39:40.261 --> 01:39:45.122]   that people are missing the Roger Stones and the Owen Schroyers and the Alex Jones,
[01:39:45.122 --> 01:39:50.100]   and they're not fully aware of the plight that you're going through after January 6th
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:53.582]  or that I'm going through or that Alex is going through.
[01:39:53.808 --> 01:40:00.254]  Too much of even the right is hypnotized by some of these false narratives and here we are to give them market options.
[01:40:00.854 --> 01:40:24.214]   Well, and your explanation of, I mean, the risk you could say that Elon Musk is taking, I think of it more of a, it's more of a risk of love, where he genuinely doesn't mind taking a massive financial loss if that ends up being the case on Twitter, because he truly believes in free speech, and I think as somebody that Elon Musk that uses Twitter, I think he just likes it.
[01:40:24.254 --> 01:40:24.915]  He likes Twitter.
[01:40:24.955 --> 01:40:25.916]  He likes the engagement.
[01:40:25.956 --> 01:40:26.857]  He likes the interaction.
[01:40:26.897 --> 01:40:29.320]  He likes to be able to put something out and everybody around the world can see it.
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:33.064]  He likes tweeting images and videos of his rocket ships going up into space.
[01:40:33.525 --> 01:40:34.766]  It's something he actually likes.
[01:40:34.806 --> 01:40:35.607]  It'd be like if somebody...
[01:40:36.641 --> 01:40:40.725]  Bought a baseball team or a football team or something because they like the sport.
[01:40:40.765 --> 01:40:45.729]  Most owners of professional teams don't make much money on the teams until they sell them again.
[01:40:46.150 --> 01:40:51.475]  They might even take a loss, but they love their Chicago Bears or they love their New York Mets or whatever it is.
[01:40:51.535 --> 01:40:52.536]  So they buy it.
[01:40:52.596 --> 01:40:53.076]  They don't care.
[01:40:53.116 --> 01:40:54.497]  It's just something that they love to have.
[01:40:54.878 --> 01:40:57.000]  I kind of view that as what Elon Musk is doing now.
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:59.042]  You said there's three priorities.
[01:40:59.782 --> 01:41:02.125]  Doing something about the permanent suspensions is one.
[01:41:02.165 --> 01:41:04.709]  There's no infrastructure or button or anything to click.
[01:41:04.729 --> 01:41:06.551]  So that's obviously going to be a bit of a process.
[01:41:06.812 --> 01:41:08.694]  We can dig into that in the next segment.
[01:41:08.714 --> 01:41:10.437]  But what are the other two priorities?
[01:41:10.957 --> 01:41:16.645]  Or can you tell us the other two priorities that Elon Musk has after taking over Twitter just 24 hours ago?
[01:41:18.197 --> 01:41:21.759]  Well, I'll speak to the personnel issue and then I'll leave one as a mystery.
[01:41:21.819 --> 01:41:30.924]  But on the personnel issue, I haven't myself been able to independently confirm the 75% number that's been reported around.
[01:41:31.044 --> 01:41:35.147]  It seems to me very difficult actually to lay off 75% of Twitter.
[01:41:37.589 --> 01:41:49.262]  You know, behind the scenes, you and I have had conversations following your banning and I've had conversations with Alex to kind of describe how the Twitter infrastructure is a lot different than Facebook.
[01:41:49.502 --> 01:41:52.085]  You know, a lot of people think of these companies as competitors.
[01:41:51.985 --> 01:41:59.185]   when they're really not. Facebook has 15,000 data points on every American user. Twitter has
[01:41:59.185 --> 01:42:03.985]   something like 15. And so it's very, very difficult to compare these companies. Twitter has less than
[01:42:03.985 --> 01:42:10.065]   10% of the employees than Facebook. So I don't see a 75% halt. But the great thing is that we've
[01:42:10.065 --> 01:42:11.905]  gotten rid of four bad executives.
[01:42:12.018 --> 01:42:16.459]  So he fired the CEO, he fired the CFO, he fired basically the general counsel.
[01:42:16.499 --> 01:42:20.280]  I call her the JJ, who was the worst demon at the company.
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:24.100]  But also, over a week ago, we lost Del Harvey.
[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:26.941]  She quit before she could get suspended.
[01:42:27.461 --> 01:42:30.642]  She has ties, reportedly, to Antifa.
[01:42:31.122 --> 01:42:33.523]  And so she has been a very big problem.
[01:42:33.583 --> 01:42:43.725]  So I say, but JJ and Del Harvey were the two names that I've always alluded to that I've talked to Gavin McInnes and yourself and Alex Jones in private and said, these are the people that need to go.
[01:42:43.785 --> 01:42:47.987]  These are the people that need to get pushed out because they were holding the board hostage.
[01:42:48.007 --> 01:42:50.927]  They were holding other executives hostage.
[01:42:51.427 --> 01:42:57.029]  And so the personnel issue and and kind of setting that tone that, hey, you can stay if you're down with the new rules.
[01:42:57.729 --> 01:43:00.112]  But if you're not down with the new rules, then you gotta go.
[01:43:00.853 --> 01:43:01.674]  But I'll say this.
[01:43:01.934 --> 01:43:07.901]  I think that Elon is going to try to move us to a different model that's not so ad-dependent.
[01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:10.404]  And that's one of his personal priorities.
[01:43:10.424 --> 01:43:12.006]  And it's priorities he's had for decades.
[01:43:12.446 --> 01:43:15.570]  Now he sees an opportunity with Twitter in moving on that.
[01:43:16.210 --> 01:43:30.840]  And of course, if it's not so ad-dependent, the excuse that the leftists had to ban free speech because of the, oh, the sponsors or the advertisers or the marketers complaining about it, that power, those teeth go away.
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:37.604]  I want to continue on the personnel issue when we come back, because I got a couple follow-up questions for Ali Alexander on that.
[01:43:38.025 --> 01:43:44.209]  But yes, good riddance to the dirty commies, the entitled brats that wanted to censor you on Twitter.
[01:43:44.409 --> 01:43:45.450]  Goodbye.
[01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:47.631]  It certainly is a time.
[01:43:47.691 --> 01:43:48.911]  It certainly is a season.
[01:43:50.691 --> 01:43:58.734]  And, you know, we're getting into the personnel issues here with Ali Alexander on the Alex Jones Show, Owen Schroer filling in at Twitter.
[01:44:00.734 --> 01:44:11.858]  I kind of want to, though, in the... Just hearing that song coming in, Ali, maybe just kind of stray from the path real quick, because I'm hearing this.
[01:44:12.518 --> 01:44:13.458]  I'm noticing this.
[01:44:13.658 --> 01:44:15.339]  I'm seeing this in real time.
[01:44:17.179 --> 01:44:19.660]  Forget about what the results of the midterms end up being.
[01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:24.562]  I feel like Americans are starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel.
[01:44:24.902 --> 01:44:30.103]  They're starting to see things that are bringing them hope that America can come back to its once greatness.
[01:44:30.163 --> 01:44:39.747]  That the liberal left ideology and everything that comes with it is in their final death rows and finally revealing itself in its final play to try to conquer us.
[01:44:40.567 --> 01:44:42.268]  Are you feeling that same energy?
[01:44:42.328 --> 01:44:43.668]  Are you getting that same vibe?
[01:44:43.728 --> 01:44:49.070]  I know you're somebody that likes to kind of go off of those vibes, those energies, try to tune into those frequencies like me.
[01:44:49.690 --> 01:44:51.871]  Are you getting that same energy?
[01:44:51.951 --> 01:44:53.771]  Are you getting that same reverb?
[01:44:54.091 --> 01:44:57.972]  Not just internally, but externally from talking to people and seeing people?
[01:44:59.153 --> 01:45:01.453]  It's so funny, you know, we're definitely in sync.
[01:45:02.014 --> 01:45:13.320]   So, 60 days ago, I felt like my spirit was saying, you know, wow, you're noticing all this great content, you know, Alex, Frankly, I thought just this is me speculating.
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:23.728]  I thought that Alex, a depression had lifted off of Alex and that he was ready to see the trials ahead of them as what they were instead of imagining what they could be.
[01:45:23.809 --> 01:45:31.054]  And oftentimes, lawfare is designed to to give you kind of this cognitive dissidence about what outcomes could be achieved.
[01:45:31.114 --> 01:45:37.079]  And I watched, you know, our friend kind of say, OK, well, you know, if you're going to crucify me, I'm going to make you do it in public.
[01:45:37.419 --> 01:45:44.408]  I was also watching Alex Stein, and he was just killing it, and I got this sense that I hadn't seen since Andrew Breitbart.
[01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:54.501]  And I was like, man, I miss Andrew, and Alex Stein has some of that jovial energy, that happy warrior energy that few possess like he did.
[01:45:55.482 --> 01:46:02.047]  And then I was watching, you know, yourself, I was watching Nicholas J. Fuentes, and I said, we're on the eve of a content renaissance.
[01:46:02.467 --> 01:46:10.914]  Okay, well then six weeks later, here we are, you know, and now we're three weeks into this thing, two weeks into this thing, and I gotta tell you, I'm feeling it.
[01:46:11.214 --> 01:46:21.542]  And it's very tough to describe, because then what I do, you know, when you're feeling this frequency, is you call the other people that you know are empaths or spiritually inclined, and you say, are you feeling something?
[01:46:21.582 --> 01:46:22.783]  Are you noticing anything?
[01:46:23.363 --> 01:46:25.825]  And no one can name what's going on.
[01:46:25.845 --> 01:46:29.087]  You know, is this 2016 Energy Part 2?
[01:46:29.167 --> 01:46:30.528]  Is this the Great Meme War?
[01:46:30.828 --> 01:46:32.569]  You know, what exactly are we seeing?
[01:46:32.789 --> 01:46:33.730]  And I'm not sure.
[01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:41.575]  I think that we're purposely not being given a descriptor of what this is because it's still formulating.
[01:46:41.615 --> 01:46:42.415]  But I'll tell you this.
[01:46:42.935 --> 01:46:51.481]  Today, the kind of the clarity that I'm coming to is that we're being, the handcuffs are coming off.
[01:46:52.105 --> 01:46:53.305]  We're being allowed to fight.
[01:46:53.385 --> 01:46:57.027]  We're about to be given an opportunity to do the right thing.
[01:46:57.547 --> 01:47:03.689]  And I think that we were given that opportunity during Stop the Steal, and that's why the deep state subverted it and inverted it.
[01:47:03.969 --> 01:47:07.430]  I think that we were given that opportunity, unfortunately, during the pandemic.
[01:47:07.710 --> 01:47:12.232]  And I think that the Trump administration, through Operation Warp Speed, you know, failed that test.
[01:47:12.552 --> 01:47:14.253]  I think America has failed a lot of tests.
[01:47:14.313 --> 01:47:18.335]  I think that we might be given one opportunity to do the right thing.
[01:47:19.155 --> 01:47:21.296]  To come together on basic truths.
[01:47:21.576 --> 01:47:26.439]  The due process violations of those criminally charged in January 6th.
[01:47:27.219 --> 01:47:28.940]  You know, this meme about the election.
[01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:31.381]  Do we want elections that have integrity or not?
[01:47:31.421 --> 01:47:35.083]  Can we have a public square where both sides can duke it out?
[01:47:35.383 --> 01:47:39.105]  I mean, these are fundamental questions on whether or not we can be a society or not.
[01:47:39.725 --> 01:47:49.550]  So I'm feeling the vibe, I'm feeling the frequency, and you know, it's corny to some, but it's uncanny that all the people who really tuned in are all feeling this.
[01:47:49.970 --> 01:47:58.114]  And I'll note this, the Ye interview with, um, I forgot which interview Ye said this in, but he's like, I was given it.
[01:47:58.214 --> 01:48:03.877]  Oh, this was when the Daily Mail had a paparazzi person outside a facility that Ye was at.
[01:48:04.217 --> 01:48:06.598]  He said, I was given all this money to lose it all.
[01:48:07.441 --> 01:48:12.126]  And this was before he lost the Adidas deal, which took $1.5 billion from his net worth.
[01:48:12.586 --> 01:48:18.732]  Elon Musk himself could really stand to lose more than half his net worth, and people don't realize it.
[01:48:19.253 --> 01:48:26.640]  And, you know, you and I and Alex, you know, we've got the government coming after us, we've got civil litigants coming after us, and we could lose everything.
[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:33.182]  Now is the opportunity to take that Founders Pledge and pledge our lives, our fortune, and our sacred honor together.
[01:48:33.502 --> 01:48:37.383]  Because really, come on, the Deep State, the NWO, they need slaves.
[01:48:37.423 --> 01:48:38.923]  They don't really want us dead.
[01:48:38.963 --> 01:48:42.524]  They'll kill a couple of us if they have to, but they really want slaves.
[01:48:42.784 --> 01:48:50.006]  And if we can just push them back, we can push them back for 50 years, 100 years, and prep the next generation to feel this fight.
[01:48:50.046 --> 01:48:51.986]  But I'm definitely feeling the vibe, Owen.
[01:48:52.526 --> 01:48:54.607]  Well, and it's kind of like- How about you?
[01:48:54.687 --> 01:48:55.227]  Are you?
[01:48:55.247 --> 01:48:55.407]  Yeah.
[01:48:56.227 --> 01:48:58.008]  It's not that I can even put words into it.
[01:48:58.068 --> 01:49:08.031]  I can more just describe a situation where we've been scratching and clawing for so long trying to expose the globalists, trying to expose the left-wing ideology.
[01:49:08.891 --> 01:49:10.431]  We've been destroyed in that process.
[01:49:10.512 --> 01:49:14.033]  Now here we are broken and destroyed, but on the eve of victory.
[01:49:14.353 --> 01:49:16.353]  Because now the globalists are exposing themselves.
[01:49:16.713 --> 01:49:19.134]  Now the radical liberal left is exposing themselves.
[01:49:19.154 --> 01:49:24.914]   It's almost like we don't even, we've been completely handicapped and removed from the fight in so many ways, it's
[01:49:24.914 --> 01:49:28.454]   almost like we're sitting here nailed strapped to the wall and just staring, just
[01:49:28.454 --> 01:49:31.194]   death staring them like, "Yeah, what you gonna do now?
[01:49:31.194 --> 01:49:32.295]  What you gonna do now?"
[01:49:32.295 --> 01:49:35.994]   Because everybody else is starting to wake up all around them.
[01:49:35.994 --> 01:49:37.394]  And that's why the midterms are so imperfect.
[01:49:37.394 --> 01:49:42.034]   I mean, win or lose, they can't put the cat back into the bag.
[01:49:42.034 --> 01:49:44.194]  Win or lose, the genie is out of the bottle.
[01:49:44.194 --> 01:49:48.994]   And if you see election results in the midterms with Kerry Lake not winning or Blake Masters
[01:49:48.994 --> 01:49:54.235]   not winning or Oz not winning, I mean, people doubting the 2020 election, that was just
[01:49:54.235 --> 01:49:55.235]  the beginning.
[01:49:55.235 --> 01:49:59.034]   I mean, the landslide of people waking up and not trusting the elections or the politicians
[01:49:59.034 --> 01:50:02.715]  or the mainstream news is gonna be a hundredfold.
[01:50:02.715 --> 01:50:07.074]   And so, yeah, that kind of enters us into a new danger zone that a lot of people aren't
[01:50:07.074 --> 01:50:10.515]  used to, but we've lived in this danger zone.
[01:50:10.505 --> 01:50:13.587]  We're like buried in the graveyard of the danger zone.
[01:50:13.607 --> 01:50:16.329]  Just like hoping to get a little air, a little water to touch us.
[01:50:16.669 --> 01:50:18.690]  So that's kind of the analogy that I see here.
[01:50:18.990 --> 01:50:24.874]  The average American is now catching up at light speed to where the rest of us have been for so long.
[01:50:26.314 --> 01:50:31.838]  And you've always said this, you know, you've always said, you know, it's me now, but it's my listeners next.
[01:50:32.399 --> 01:50:34.160]  And not enough people realize this.
[01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:44.768]  This system of oppression is scalable, whether it's deep platforming, lawfare, fake criminal charges, accusations, you know, deep fake videos and memes.
[01:50:45.168 --> 01:50:46.669]  It's all scalable.
[01:50:47.010 --> 01:50:51.173]  And so, you know, we've got to take this opportunity to hold fast to each other like brothers.
[01:50:51.512 --> 01:50:53.712]  and really support each other.
[01:50:53.712 --> 01:50:56.712]  And that's the opportunity that replatforming on Twitter is.
[01:50:56.712 --> 01:51:02.233]   I haven't been able to pay all my legal bills, but if I have my Twitter account, I can.
[01:51:02.233 --> 01:51:06.271]  And so they cannot disrupt the dissidence in this movement.
[01:51:06.271 --> 01:51:12.273]   And democracies and republics rely on the perception that there is a consensus amongst the people.
[01:51:12.273 --> 01:51:17.872]   And what you and I, and frankly, the corporations know, is that there is no consensus among the American public
[01:51:17.872 --> 01:51:21.472]   because they haven't been given at least two options, and there's more than two options.
[01:51:21.477 --> 01:51:22.638]  We want our options.
[01:51:22.958 --> 01:51:30.803]  The American people deserve options and so, you know, I think that this is a fascinating time to be alive and like you said, you and I, we're already dead.
[01:51:31.223 --> 01:51:32.044]  We're already dead.
[01:51:32.524 --> 01:51:37.809]  But the Bible tells us, right, that we can be resurrected, and in this fight, we're sort of being resurrected.
[01:51:37.889 --> 01:51:53.121]  I mean, it's the ninth inning, you know, we're at the eight-yard line, and it's just, not the ninth inning, we're at fourth down, and, you know, the eight-yard line, it's just kind of weird, it's kind of freaky, and I'm loving it, and this is God.
[01:51:53.321 --> 01:51:55.403]  This isn't our Republican leaders, this is God.
[01:51:55.663 --> 01:51:56.524]  No, absolutely.
[01:51:56.544 --> 01:51:57.384]  100% right.
[01:51:57.404 --> 01:51:58.085]  Couldn't agree more.
[01:51:58.605 --> 01:52:02.348]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to get back to the issue at hand with the personnel at Twitter.
[01:52:03.089 --> 01:52:08.833]  And as we're sitting here talking, Elon Musk has just put out a huge tweet.
[01:52:09.874 --> 01:52:13.957]  Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints.
[01:52:14.137 --> 01:52:18.581]  No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.
[01:52:18.601 --> 01:52:19.762]  We'll talk about that on the other side.
[01:52:20.663 --> 01:52:29.410]  Folks, quickly, this situation with the Pelosi House home invasion is spiraling out of control right now.
[01:52:30.391 --> 01:52:36.396]  And so, you know, I had mentioned it earlier, and I said I was going to lay off of the coverage, and then there was some breaking news in it.
[01:52:36.456 --> 01:52:41.520]  Now I'm looking at all the new breaking news, and folks, this thing is just totally out of control.
[01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:50.506]   But you notice when Paul Pelosi was driving a vehicle inebriated with a woman in the car with him, Yeah, and almost killed somebody.
[01:52:50.526 --> 01:52:52.247]  You notice how they didn't have a big problem with that?
[01:52:52.547 --> 01:52:54.767]  Did you ever hear about that victim of Paul Pelosi?
[01:52:55.087 --> 01:52:55.827]  No, you didn't.
[01:52:56.147 --> 01:53:05.669]  But you're going to hear all about this protester that somehow got his way into Pelosi's open house through two, three, four lines of security cameras and everything.
[01:53:06.030 --> 01:53:07.310]  No videos from that night.
[01:53:07.390 --> 01:53:13.291]  I'm surprised Pelosi didn't have a documentary film crew there filming when the guy entered the house like she did on January 6th.
[01:53:13.331 --> 01:53:16.232]  But we'll get more into that later because I do have a couple of questions.
[01:53:16.352 --> 01:53:17.392]  Ali did write a story.
[01:53:18.254 --> 01:53:21.775]  About the Pelosi cover-up, but I want to get back into the Twitter personnel thing now, Ali.
[01:53:21.835 --> 01:53:27.676]  And so, this tweet from Elon Musk just came out moments ago.
[01:53:28.277 --> 01:53:34.078]  Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints.
[01:53:34.138 --> 01:53:39.759]  No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:45.901]  Can you give us more insider information on that or any other personnel information in regards to that?
[01:53:47.068 --> 01:53:50.949]  Well, it was interesting because a bunch of friends asked me, do we need to create new accounts?
[01:53:51.630 --> 01:53:56.131]  And what I was told is, is that we likely wouldn't need new accounts.
[01:53:56.491 --> 01:54:00.072]  But additionally, you know, it's not like I'm some reporter full time or something.
[01:54:00.372 --> 01:54:08.335]  My own view was that if we were going to be forced to create new accounts, then I was going to go hog wild and bad things happen when I go hog wild.
[01:54:08.395 --> 01:54:10.816]  So, so I was like, no, we need our old accounts back.
[01:54:10.836 --> 01:54:13.597]  It sounded like that that was the consensus that was forming.
[01:54:14.938 --> 01:54:18.320]  And then I was told, you know, what do you think?
[01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:23.403]  You know, I was asked, what do you think the process looks like for people like yourself coming back?
[01:54:23.443 --> 01:54:26.785]  And I said, look, I, you know, I'm okay with a little bit of a mea culpa.
[01:54:26.805 --> 01:54:33.048]  You know, there are certain things that, you know, I'm willing to concede to get back on the battlefield.
[01:54:33.328 --> 01:54:38.631]  And I think that something that we, you know, a couple, you know, the way that we approach this needs to be very, very prudent.
[01:54:39.231 --> 01:54:41.472]  And I said, you know, you guys do need a process.
[01:54:41.532 --> 01:54:51.984]   If this looks like Elon is ruling by fiat instead of giving a vision that is then policy is formed around that, then it's not sustainable.
[01:54:52.044 --> 01:54:55.468]  We need a secession plan for Elon's vision.
[01:54:55.929 --> 01:55:00.715]  And, you know, I think that that's what people in the Valley and good executives believe too.
[01:55:01.175 --> 01:55:23.944]   And so today I think that you're seeing him announce part of those first steps that there needs to be a process and so I've had a couple friends file their appeals and I'm not wasting my time on the appeals people like me and people like you Owen and Alex and Roger Stone and Laura Loomer we have additional locks on our account because we're newsworthy individuals and so Uh, we just got to trust the process.
[01:55:23.984 --> 01:55:26.104]  We got to let the process create itself.
[01:55:26.344 --> 01:55:33.166]  We got to participate in the process, and we got to push back when we think that the process is going to lead to long-term bad outcomes.
[01:55:33.466 --> 01:55:44.030]   But right now, he's attempting to set up something that is encouraging of dialogue, and I think that I, you know, I told people, we'll be back soon.
[01:55:44.250 --> 01:55:47.472]  It'll be sooner than you expect, but not immediate.
[01:55:47.732 --> 01:55:53.836]  And I think that Elon with this news today is letting people know that, you know, once again, I was ahead of the media.
[01:55:55.563 --> 01:55:58.864]  Well, and I will just go ahead and say this now.
[01:56:00.064 --> 01:56:23.692]  I logged into my Twitter account for the first time in a while last night, and ever since I was banned years ago, by the way, they never gave me any reason for the ban, the only thing I could derive for any reason was, I think it was either a Newsweek or a Daily Beast story or a Politico story, where I was on a livestream, and I'm not kidding you folks, I coughed.
[01:56:24.452 --> 01:56:31.580]  I coughed on a live stream, and whoever it was, Daily Beast Politico, said, Owen Schroeder needs to be banned from Twitter.
[01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:33.702]  He coughed on a live stream during the pandemic.
[01:56:34.083 --> 01:56:35.264]  Not even kidding you, folks.
[01:56:35.464 --> 01:56:44.234]  That was... Now, so after they published that story of me coughing on a live stream during the pandemic, after they published that, I was banned the next day.
[01:56:44.694 --> 01:56:52.566]  Never got an email from Twitter, never got one, two, three strikes, never had a tweet linked that they offered if you delete this or correct it, we'll get rid of it.
[01:56:52.646 --> 01:56:54.890]  No, just boom, wiped off of Twitter with that.
[01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:57.053]  Now, at that time...
[01:56:58.166 --> 01:57:00.328]  I could log into my account, but there was nothing there.
[01:57:00.908 --> 01:57:03.530]  It was the picture of the egg as my profile.
[01:57:03.690 --> 01:57:06.012]  It was the standard open your account avatar.
[01:57:06.472 --> 01:57:08.574]  And I couldn't access any of the tweets or any information.
[01:57:09.254 --> 01:57:09.875]  There it is right there.
[01:57:09.895 --> 01:57:11.016]  It was Media Matters.
[01:57:11.436 --> 01:57:17.100]  Twitter is facilitating the promotion of an InfoWars host rally that will flout Texas's social distance order.
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:18.882]  And you can see they have the picture of me coughing.
[01:57:20.302 --> 01:57:26.065]  They put the picture of me coughing on the front page and they said, look, he coughed during a live stream during a pandemic.
[01:57:26.105 --> 01:57:26.805]  He needs to get banned.
[01:57:27.605 --> 01:57:30.206]  I logged into my account for the first time last night.
[01:57:30.346 --> 01:57:32.307]  I could see my profile picture.
[01:57:32.827 --> 01:57:34.608]  I could see my old tweets.
[01:57:35.448 --> 01:57:39.530]  And for the first time ever, I was able to appeal my suspension.
[01:57:39.850 --> 01:57:53.156]  Now again, I'm not expecting there to be any, you know, immediate action on that, but clearly something has changed where it used to be when I logged in it was the egg picture, couldn't see any of the metadata, nothing, couldn't appeal, nothing.
[01:57:53.696 --> 01:57:56.618]  Now I can look in and see all my old stuff and appeal.
[01:57:56.698 --> 01:57:58.599]  I even got a response from the Twitter support team.
[01:57:58.619 --> 01:58:00.779]  So something is in the works.
[01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:02.100]  I mean, do you know?
[01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:12.244]   I mean, this could just be the Twitter People hiding all their crimes ahead of Elon Musk taking over and changing all the algorithms and code and stuff so that he can't see what they've really done.
[01:58:12.264 --> 01:58:16.806]  Or have there been moves maybe made behind the scenes?
[01:58:16.866 --> 01:58:18.546]  Just little stuff that has happened.
[01:58:19.847 --> 01:58:24.769]  Well, yeah, and there's a notification inside of your profile that says it's in read-only mode.
[01:58:25.169 --> 01:58:36.485]   And this is important because I think it's going to It charts a path forward for sites that want to be an alternative authentication.
[01:58:36.645 --> 01:58:42.667]  So, you know, like I use my Twitter to log in to a site called like ProductHunt.com.
[01:58:42.847 --> 01:58:50.589]  So I haven't been able to log into ProductHunt because I don't sign in into Twitter and I've never created an alternative account or anything else like that.
[01:58:51.669 --> 01:59:02.250]   But what I'll say is, is that, is that while the deal was going through and Elon was making its bid, The Twitter team kind of had a fiduciary duty to continue
[01:59:02.250 --> 01:59:07.340]   to follow its insane policies because that's what its CEO wanted them to do and that's
[01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:09.570]   what their board wanted them to do.
[01:59:09.570 --> 01:59:12.890]   So they kind of had a legal right to keep wasting money, frankly.
[01:59:12.890 --> 01:59:20.970]   I mean, tens of millions of dollars spent of the shareholders' money that Elon's going
[01:59:20.970 --> 01:59:22.449]  to repeal.
[01:59:22.711 --> 01:59:31.274]  But they also needed to start making moves with the smaller team that showed good faith efforts and preserved data and did all kinds of other things.
[01:59:31.354 --> 01:59:34.995]  Because Elon also assumes all of Twitter's liabilities.
[01:59:35.075 --> 01:59:38.677]   So as long as Twitter disclosed The liabilities to him.
[01:59:39.477 --> 01:59:41.458]  Elon now assumes those liabilities.
[01:59:41.478 --> 01:59:45.820]  So if I wanted to sue Twitter tomorrow, I would be suing Elon's Twitter.
[01:59:46.481 --> 01:59:47.901]  There's no past Twitter to sue.
[01:59:48.361 --> 01:59:58.446]  And so as far as I understand it, Twitter basically took two tracks where 80% of their actions were anti-Elon.
[01:59:59.667 --> 02:00:00.808]  And they tried to kill the deal.
[02:00:00.828 --> 02:00:03.949]  They tried to do all kinds of dirty things behind the scenes.
[02:00:03.969 --> 02:00:11.740]   But 20% of it was The board of directors and the executives for legal reasons needing to show good faith.
[02:00:12.381 --> 02:00:16.524]  And so, yeah, I still haven't tried to log into my account.
[02:00:16.564 --> 02:00:18.505]  I'm just, you know, I'm just I'm just going to wait.
[02:00:18.525 --> 02:00:25.651]  I've been I've been just fine for 21 months and, you know, I'll wait another month or two if I if I need to.
[02:00:26.590 --> 02:00:37.822]  By the way, do you know how Parag and Vijaya were able to fandango a deal that they get fired and make $200 million collectively on their exit?
[02:00:37.902 --> 02:00:39.484]  How did they get that deal done?
[02:00:41.016 --> 02:00:44.437]  I mean, it's a part of your deal when you become an executive.
[02:00:44.817 --> 02:00:58.181]  So one, when you become at that level of a publicly traded company, your severance packages are in one sense pre-negotiated, and then on the way out, they're also renegotiated.
[02:00:58.581 --> 02:01:08.654]   And so there's a windfall of sorts because Elon paid above The valuation of Twitter, above the market cap of Twitter stock.
[02:01:09.195 --> 02:01:12.677]  Not only that, that was before the stock market fell out.
[02:01:13.117 --> 02:01:18.981]  So it's kind of like a double windfall for them and good riddance to them.
[02:01:19.142 --> 02:01:20.943]  I mean, just absolutely good riddance to them.
[02:01:21.463 --> 02:01:21.703]  Yeah.
[02:01:22.144 --> 02:01:31.050]  But I'm sure, you know, they're good liberals, so they'll turn around and probably give that hundreds of millions to, you know, a charity, organization, or something like that, because they're good liberals, and they hate the rich, right?
[02:01:31.070 --> 02:01:31.530]  I mean, come on.
[02:01:31.790 --> 02:01:33.251]  We know they hate the rich so much.
[02:01:33.851 --> 02:01:35.032]  Oh, except when it's their money.
[02:01:35.072 --> 02:01:35.793]  They love the rich.
[02:01:36.133 --> 02:01:42.237]  Kind of like Bono, who's worth almost a billion dollars, and Bono now comes out and says, wait a second, I was wrong.
[02:01:42.317 --> 02:01:43.678]  Capitalism is the answer.
[02:01:43.778 --> 02:01:44.739]  Capitalism is good.
[02:01:44.799 --> 02:01:46.160]  It's rich people that can save the world.
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:46.840]  What?
[02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:48.861]  Bono's a capitalist now?
[02:01:48.901 --> 02:01:49.622]  It couldn't be.
[02:01:49.642 --> 02:01:49.682]  No.
[02:01:50.062 --> 02:01:50.903]  No, Bono.
[02:01:51.363 --> 02:01:51.523]  Oh no!
[02:01:52.604 --> 02:02:21.478]   Alright ladies and gentlemen, we're back here with Ali Alexander on the Alex Jones Show, Owen Troyer sitting in, and you know I said this earlier, I was hesitant and I was going to wait to cover the latest out of the Pelosi home invasion, and then I kind of got into it and broke the latest news, and it's not that I regret that, but I think I kind of jumped the shark a little bit, because now the propaganda is overwhelming, and so I kind of jumped the shark before the major propaganda hit, Now it's full on.
[02:02:21.518 --> 02:02:22.338]  They're blaming Trump.
[02:02:22.378 --> 02:02:23.439]  They're blaming Trump supporters.
[02:02:23.459 --> 02:02:26.180]  They're saying, look, Trump supporters are trying to kill politicians.
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:34.825]  Of course, ignoring the legitimate assassins that went and shot Steve Scalise, went and tried to kill Brett Kavanaugh and all the other Democrat assassins.
[02:02:34.865 --> 02:02:35.826]  They ignore that.
[02:02:35.946 --> 02:02:42.569]  And so that just shows you that, yes, this is, whether it was designed to be this way or not, it is being used for political propaganda.
[02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:44.431]  And so there's a lot of questions.
[02:02:44.471 --> 02:02:45.711]  I don't really want to get into it now.
[02:02:45.771 --> 02:02:46.632]  I just want to say this.
[02:02:47.912 --> 02:02:59.644]   It looks like However deep this goes, it looks like this might be an attempt at a big October surprise ahead of the midterms initiated out of the home invasion of Paul Pelosi.
[02:03:00.164 --> 02:03:08.450]  Now, I'm going to have to sit and wait as more information is incoming on this to really do a deep analysis and give you what I think my perspective is.
[02:03:08.830 --> 02:03:13.954]  I kind of jumped the shark on it a little bit, but now I'm seeing it's like it's full on, folks.
[02:03:13.994 --> 02:03:19.878]  They're really going to try to make this the big story this weekend and blame Trump and blame conservatives and say, look, they're all terrorists.
[02:03:20.738 --> 02:03:26.081]  And there's still a lot of questions remaining that are pretty obvious to the people watching.
[02:03:26.101 --> 02:03:32.224]  But Ali, I don't really necessarily want to get into that, but it's all in the same vein to me as January 6th.
[02:03:32.404 --> 02:03:34.325]  Oh, January 6th, worst day since 9-11.
[02:03:35.586 --> 02:03:40.429]  And yet somehow Nancy Pelosi has a documentary film crew following her around all day?
[02:03:40.449 --> 02:03:41.930]  Wow, what perfect timing.
[02:03:42.130 --> 02:03:45.132]  And then they release the videos to the public right before the midterms?
[02:03:45.392 --> 02:03:48.293]  Turns out her son-in-law is there with the QAnon shaman?
[02:03:48.694 --> 02:03:50.555]  Wow, what are the odds of all of that happening?
[02:03:51.095 --> 02:03:53.016]  So you wrote a story the other day, though.
[02:03:53.576 --> 02:03:56.258]  This is so incredible, actually.
[02:03:56.638 --> 02:04:00.180]  Pelosi cover-up, now we know why Democrats lied about Trump's National Guard offer.
[02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:06.462]  There's a story every once in a while that is an open-shut case.
[02:04:06.542 --> 02:04:14.846]  You know, a lot of these times there's a lot of hearsay, a lot of opinion, and you kind of have to crawl through the mud, if you will.
[02:04:15.366 --> 02:04:18.468]  You'll never come out clean trying to figure out what's going on.
[02:04:18.948 --> 02:04:21.830]  With this story, it's clean, it's clear-cut as day.
[02:04:22.250 --> 02:04:28.615]   We have the receipts of Trump Asking for the DC police to be enhanced that day and Mario Bowser saying no.
[02:04:28.675 --> 02:04:29.656]  We have the receipts.
[02:04:29.956 --> 02:04:36.202]  We have the receipts of Trump asking for the National Guard to be initiated by Nancy Pelosi on that day.
[02:04:36.222 --> 02:04:38.644]  We have the receipts of her standing it down.
[02:04:39.325 --> 02:04:41.387]  And now they say, oh it's Trump's fault.
[02:04:41.547 --> 02:04:42.668]  Trump stood down the police.
[02:04:42.828 --> 02:04:45.090]  Trump stood down the National Guard.
[02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.731]  What?
[02:04:46.391 --> 02:04:51.054]  We literally have the evidence, the phone calls, the emails, the texts, it's all there.
[02:04:51.374 --> 02:04:55.156]  And then they run stories saying it's not, you covered that for the Gateway Pundit.
[02:04:55.957 --> 02:05:01.560]  Try to put this into perspective for the audience here, just how ludicrous this is.
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:04.662]  The sun rises in the West, water is not wet.
[02:05:04.982 --> 02:05:05.963]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:05:07.651 --> 02:05:14.273]  Yeah, you know, Owen, it's really tough because there's a story and a meme that the public understands.
[02:05:14.573 --> 02:05:20.234]  And that's that Trump and the committee are fighting something about National Guard, something, something, something.
[02:05:20.775 --> 02:05:23.355]  And then there is how it relates to the law.
[02:05:23.835 --> 02:05:28.758]   This literally affects The criminal defendants.
[02:05:29.138 --> 02:05:34.442]  This literally affects people targeted by the January 6th Select Committee like myself.
[02:05:35.143 --> 02:05:37.164]  And what we knew and what we didn't know.
[02:05:37.204 --> 02:05:47.011]  And this literally affects whether or not Trump can be charged with a crime that Liz Cheney is trying to whip up support for a criminal referral from the committee.
[02:05:47.311 --> 02:05:49.613]  And there's internal battles going on in the committee.
[02:05:50.012 --> 02:05:56.252]   And so what's interesting is I had to tell this story in a chronological way, in a compelling
[02:05:56.252 --> 02:05:58.851]  way that also had the receipts.
[02:05:58.851 --> 02:06:02.492]   And I didn't want anyone to overlook it because the story sounds familiar.
[02:06:02.492 --> 02:06:08.972]   Again, we know that Trump and the committee have been fighting over the National Guard.
[02:06:08.972 --> 02:06:13.813]   What I did not know, I was missing one piece of the puzzle, one piece of the puzzle that
[02:06:13.813 --> 02:06:14.932]  I was missing.
[02:06:14.932 --> 02:06:20.252]   And Nancy Pelosi's daughter provided that for us in what I think is illegal footage.
[02:06:20.196 --> 02:06:21.176]  It is illegal footage.
[02:06:21.536 --> 02:06:30.499]  And let me say this, Nancy Pelosi's daughter is holding onto footage that might be exculpatory evidence for all these criminal defendants.
[02:06:31.019 --> 02:06:35.703]  We have evidence that Nancy Pelosi authorized her daughter in a professional capacity.
[02:06:35.743 --> 02:06:37.605]  A lot of people can focus on the personal capacity.
[02:06:37.945 --> 02:06:40.507]  She was there in a professional capacity.
[02:06:41.128 --> 02:06:41.929]  Her husband worked for me.
[02:06:41.969 --> 02:06:44.791]  And by the way, just so people understand this, that means there's a paper trail.
[02:06:45.071 --> 02:06:46.112]  That means there's requests.
[02:06:46.152 --> 02:06:48.014]  I mean, you have to get access there.
[02:06:48.294 --> 02:06:51.557]  There's a bunch of sign-offs and a routine to get that access.
[02:06:51.617 --> 02:06:53.699]  It's not like she can just show up with a camera crew.
[02:06:54.924 --> 02:06:55.104]  Right.
[02:06:55.804 --> 02:06:57.865]  And so we know that there was all kinds of clearance.
[02:06:57.885 --> 02:06:59.426]  There was talking with the U.S.
[02:06:59.466 --> 02:07:00.106]  Capitol Police.
[02:07:00.126 --> 02:07:02.027]  The Speaker of the House has U.S.
[02:07:02.067 --> 02:07:02.647]  Capitol Police.
[02:07:02.687 --> 02:07:11.411]  I mean, you know, we should eventually talk about, well, not on this, not on this show, but we should talk soon about Nancy Pelosi's home break-in because that there's a lot of questions there.
[02:07:11.451 --> 02:07:14.872]  And I had a source tip me off right before I came on air.
[02:07:14.912 --> 02:07:15.973]  So that's a whole nother thing.
[02:07:16.013 --> 02:07:22.816]  But look, the fact is, is that Nancy Pelosi's daughter was given privileges that other members of Congress weren't.
[02:07:22.936 --> 02:07:28.696]   She was with The people who secure the continuity of government and she filmed the whole thing.
[02:07:29.457 --> 02:07:30.939]  We need that footage released.
[02:07:31.179 --> 02:07:31.960]  She has this footage.
[02:07:32.221 --> 02:07:43.888]   How did Nancy Pelosi, who has watched other and overseen and participated in January 6 lawful objections at the congressional level, How was she able to know that this time she wanted it filmed?
[02:07:43.948 --> 02:07:49.272]  Let's try to make this a little more palatable for the audience to sink their teeth into.
[02:07:49.592 --> 02:08:05.266]  Folks, this would be like if Nancy Pelosi invited her daughter and a documentary film crew into, you know, let's say the basement of the White House when Biden and Pelosi were discussing nuclear secrets or if they're going to nuclear strike Russia or something, and she had her film crew in there filming it.
[02:08:05.746 --> 02:08:09.630]  And obviously there would be extreme violations there of U.S.
[02:08:09.670 --> 02:08:16.617]  government policy and code if she did that, but you're saying that on a lower level, that's basically the access that she was given.
[02:08:17.978 --> 02:08:19.179]  It's the access she was given.
[02:08:19.399 --> 02:08:20.360]  It was unlawful.
[02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:26.566]  For example, they film a conversation with Nancy Pelosi and former Governor Hogan in Maryland.
[02:08:26.586 --> 02:08:28.428]  Maryland is a two-party consent state.
[02:08:30.247 --> 02:08:30.707]  She didn't.
[02:08:31.627 --> 02:08:33.628]  I think Virginia might be a one-party state.
[02:08:35.088 --> 02:08:35.348]  D.C.
[02:08:35.388 --> 02:08:36.989]  is definitely a one-party state.
[02:08:37.769 --> 02:08:50.111]  But they're also filming conversations, national security conversations, with the sitting Attorney General, the Secretary of the Department of Defense, and none of these people had communication with the President at the time.
[02:08:50.411 --> 02:08:52.652]  This was a violation of the separation of powers.
[02:08:52.912 --> 02:09:05.499]   They were filming national security conversations, and HBO and CNN Are in possession of that footage, while people who are charged with crimes and complaints that reference that they disrupted this event aren't.
[02:09:05.759 --> 02:09:14.045]  This also shows that Nancy Pelosi had a premeditated awareness that this was a newsworthy event, that this was an event that she should have secured the Capitol.
[02:09:14.345 --> 02:09:20.249]   So she actually violated Um, she has a dereliction of duty as the Speaker of the House.
[02:09:20.529 --> 02:09:37.777]  And what you're going to see Liz Cheney, and I'll break it here, what you're going to see Liz Cheney push for, and what I think she'll find votes on the January 6th Select Committee, this is going to get me in big trouble, is Liz Cheney is going to suggest that there's something called the Take Care Clause in the United States Constitution that should prohibit Donald Trump from running again.
[02:09:37.797 --> 02:09:45.300]  And that we should use the 14th Amendment and the Take Care Clause to prevent Donald Trump from ever running from President again.
[02:09:45.985 --> 02:09:51.667]  Nancy Pelosi essentially doesn't have a take care clause, but she is given jurisdiction over the U.S.
[02:09:51.687 --> 02:09:52.247]  Capitol grounds.
[02:09:52.507 --> 02:09:58.029]  That's why she makes that ridiculous comment about punching Donald Trump, because those grounds are hers.
[02:09:58.089 --> 02:10:01.550]  By the separation of powers, she controls those grounds.
[02:10:01.811 --> 02:10:04.131]  And so my story lays out all the receipts.
[02:10:04.231 --> 02:10:11.674]  I lay out how the Democrats deny that they want National Guard, Trump wants them to have National Guard, and here's an important distinction I want everyone to realize.
[02:10:12.214 --> 02:10:17.438]  Trump cannot order the National Guard to go onto the grounds of the U.S.
[02:10:17.458 --> 02:10:17.959]  Capitol.
[02:10:17.979 --> 02:10:20.401]  He can only pre-authorize it.
[02:10:20.441 --> 02:10:21.542]  He can authorize it.
[02:10:21.882 --> 02:10:30.229]  Not only did Trump authorize it, he recommended it and he ordered his government to lean on the local government and to lean on the U.S.
[02:10:30.269 --> 02:10:33.912]  Capitol and make sure that the offer was seen in good faith.
[02:10:34.492 --> 02:10:35.693]  And the offer was rejected.
[02:10:35.733 --> 02:10:37.193]  So thank God for Trump.
[02:10:37.434 --> 02:10:45.598]  We have a paper trail that Mayor Browser and Nancy Pelosi did not want an event that was well-coordinated.
[02:10:45.658 --> 02:10:47.578]  They did not want structured fencing.
[02:10:47.839 --> 02:10:51.480]  They didn't want to inform organizers about restricted area.
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:55.302]  They did not want a police presence to deter or direct traffic.
[02:10:55.602 --> 02:10:58.444]  They purposely set us up and we've got the goods.
[02:10:58.484 --> 02:11:00.065]  And that's why Jim Hoff texted me.
[02:11:00.085 --> 02:11:02.926]  He said, Ali, your story was viral within 10 minutes.
[02:11:03.366 --> 02:11:06.572]  And so, this is the case against Nancy Pelosi.
[02:11:06.592 --> 02:11:08.876]  It's the criminal case against Nancy Pelosi.
[02:11:09.741 --> 02:11:20.164]  Well, and this is why when I look forward to midterms, and just do five short minutes with me on the other segment, on the other side of this break, we can kind of get into your opinion on the midterms, I realize the Democrats are all in.
[02:11:20.844 --> 02:11:25.665]  And so we can sit here and look at all the anecdotal evidence all around us that there's set to be a red wave.
[02:11:26.005 --> 02:11:26.926]  Folks, you don't understand.
[02:11:26.986 --> 02:11:28.046]  They are all in.
[02:11:28.406 --> 02:11:34.828]  And they know if the Democrats lose Congress, their entire January 6th fraud is done.
[02:11:35.368 --> 02:11:36.509]  It's done, folks.
[02:11:36.529 --> 02:11:52.615]  You're going to have real Republicans get in there and launch their own investigation, not just into the January 6th committee, but then further digging into the evidence of why Nancy Pelosi stood down the National Guard, why she was able to get a documentary film crew in her office that day, and why the mayor of D.C.
[02:11:52.755 --> 02:11:53.995]  also stood down the D.C.
[02:11:54.035 --> 02:11:54.815]  police that day.
[02:11:55.216 --> 02:11:56.716]  Then you'll start to get the real questions.
[02:11:57.096 --> 02:12:01.078]  And they know the only reason they've been able to get away with this is because they have full control of the media.
[02:12:01.918 --> 02:12:04.239]  If the media covers this story, it's game over.
[02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:17.187]  But if the Republicans take back Congress and investigate the Democrats' involvement and the Feds' involvement in January 6th, not only is it game over, it's criminal investigation and charge time, folks.
[02:12:17.667 --> 02:12:19.868]  Everything hinges on this midterm election.
[02:12:20.228 --> 02:12:22.550]  That's why I'm betting the Democrats are going to steal it.
[02:12:22.730 --> 02:12:24.691]  We'll get Ali Alexander's opinion on the other side.
[02:12:25.091 --> 02:12:27.233]  All right, my final segment here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:27.273 --> 02:12:29.755]  By the way, Alex Jones will return this weekend.
[02:12:30.316 --> 02:12:32.798]  Be on the lookout for that at Bandop Video.
[02:12:33.018 --> 02:12:36.001]  I am going to be hosting the War Room coming up in an hour.
[02:12:36.161 --> 02:12:37.342]  It's Veterans Call-In Day.
[02:12:37.382 --> 02:12:38.763]  We got a couple great veteran guests.
[02:12:39.164 --> 02:12:42.647]  I've got some other news I'll cover, but we'll be taking a lot of calls in the War Room coming up in an hour.
[02:12:43.067 --> 02:12:44.028]  Oli Alexander with me.
[02:12:44.068 --> 02:12:46.190]  Another segment before Jay Dyer takes over here.
[02:12:46.971 --> 02:12:48.092]  Oli, here's where I'm at now.
[02:12:49.369 --> 02:12:57.896]  The Vegas odds, the odds makers in Vegas now have Republicans at the highest odds so far this year to win the House and Senate.
[02:12:57.936 --> 02:13:00.398]  I think it's in the 60th percentile now.
[02:13:00.438 --> 02:13:05.462]  That's a huge margin when it comes to Vegas odds for Republicans to win the House and the Senate.
[02:13:05.802 --> 02:13:12.447]  And of course all the anecdotal evidence shows us that that will be the case too, just like in 2020 it did with Trump, but ultimately we saw the results.
[02:13:12.487 --> 02:13:13.268]  Now here's my fear.
[02:13:14.589 --> 02:13:32.747]   I look at this as a Democrats knowing that They're never going to have more power than they have right now, and all of their wet dreams of adding two more states to control the Electoral College, ending the filibuster to stop anybody from disrupting their legislative agenda, and
[02:13:33.328 --> 02:13:35.531]  Just all the other stuff that they're involved in.
[02:13:36.032 --> 02:13:37.654]  Amnesty, open borders, I mean, you name it.
[02:13:37.715 --> 02:13:39.718]  They know this is all within arm's reach right now.
[02:13:40.118 --> 02:13:45.466]  All they need is to secure the midterms, two more years under Biden, they can do it all, blame it on Biden, and then they have total control.
[02:13:45.486 --> 02:13:47.189]  They'll probably even cancel elections if they can.
[02:13:47.209 --> 02:13:48.210]  I'm not even kidding you folks, they will.
[02:13:48.971 --> 02:13:51.492]  And so, yeah, I see all the polls.
[02:13:51.532 --> 02:13:52.773]  Yeah, I see the Vegas odds.
[02:13:52.793 --> 02:13:54.034]  Yeah, I see the anecdotal evidence.
[02:13:54.054 --> 02:14:00.877]  When I go out in the Infowars truck and nine out of ten interactions are positive now, where it used to be maybe five or six, it's nine out of ten.
[02:14:01.437 --> 02:14:03.779]  But I also realize they've got it all on the table.
[02:14:03.839 --> 02:14:05.299]  Democrats are all in right now.
[02:14:05.660 --> 02:14:11.563]  Of course, they're going to try to pull off another massive theft like they did in 2020 and then label you a terrorist if you say that.
[02:14:12.043 --> 02:14:12.643]  What do you think?
[02:14:12.883 --> 02:14:16.105]  What do you expect here in 11 days at the midterms, Ali Alexander?
[02:14:17.461 --> 02:14:18.902]  You know, it's really tough.
[02:14:18.922 --> 02:14:21.985]  You know, I'm certain that the Republicans are going to win the House.
[02:14:22.525 --> 02:14:26.028]  I think that this has been energized by the voters and not leadership.
[02:14:26.428 --> 02:14:32.153]  And so if you asked me three weeks ago, I would say that we're going to have a narrow, narrow majority.
[02:14:33.073 --> 02:14:34.354]  The voters kicked into high gear.
[02:14:34.375 --> 02:14:37.997]  I think the high gas prices and the prospect of World War Three.
[02:14:38.037 --> 02:14:44.783]  I think the energy here at Infowars.com has energized people to say, OK, I'm going to give you one last chance.
[02:14:46.265 --> 02:14:51.385]   The Senate races are very interesting because you essentially have four seats in play, Nevada,
[02:14:51.385 --> 02:14:56.985]   Arizona, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, where they've tried to do these isolated sign-ups.
[02:14:56.985 --> 02:15:02.425]   And what we're seeing with the Pelosi break-in, they first tried to implode the Ohio race and
[02:15:02.425 --> 02:15:07.144]   get us to dump another $50 million into that race and tell us it was closer than it was.
[02:15:07.325 --> 02:15:08.925]  We didn't fall for it as a party.
[02:15:09.766 --> 02:15:18.849]  Then they went to Georgia and they pulled this hoax against Hershel Walker, which every Georgian needs to vote for, especially Christians and those who are pro-life.
[02:15:18.869 --> 02:15:23.591]  They need to vote for him and stand with him.
[02:15:23.611 --> 02:15:27.293]  It's really tough to see what's going to happen in the Senate because the Senate could break one way.
[02:15:27.613 --> 02:15:30.693]   Those four seats could Those four seats could go Democrat.
[02:15:31.634 --> 02:15:33.174]  I think that we'll have a narrow Senate majority.
[02:15:33.554 --> 02:15:35.875]  Here's what I want everyone to kind of strap in for.
[02:15:35.895 --> 02:15:38.095]  The Republican majorities are going to disappoint us.
[02:15:38.595 --> 02:15:39.975]  They are going to betray Trump.
[02:15:40.576 --> 02:15:47.337]  As he runs for President of the United States and his announcement is imminent, he's going to be pinned against his own party.
[02:15:47.917 --> 02:15:49.598]  Our party is going to be pinned against us.
[02:15:49.878 --> 02:15:51.418]  And so we'll take a lot of the blame.
[02:15:52.319 --> 02:15:59.547]  Actually, for threats of government shutdown and the economic meltdown that is coming here in the winter.
[02:15:59.767 --> 02:16:02.270]  Absolute, you know, it's a crap show.
[02:16:03.647 --> 02:16:08.854]  I think that we'll win, but I think that they're winning so that they can compromise and cuck McCarthy's speakership.
[02:16:09.554 --> 02:16:12.758]  McConnell is going to do all kinds of dirty things to make sure that we lose.
[02:16:13.059 --> 02:16:16.463]  In a lot of ways, winning the majority is our biggest problem.
[02:16:16.763 --> 02:16:28.873]   And so what we got to do is be prepared to hold these people accountable, get a J6 select committee We need to dissolve the US Capitol Police units in California and Florida.
[02:16:28.913 --> 02:16:32.674]  We need to release the 14,000 hours of footage.
[02:16:32.974 --> 02:16:37.136]  We need to have financial settlements with those whose due process rights have been violated.
[02:16:37.336 --> 02:16:39.117]  We need to impeach Merrick Garland.
[02:16:39.137 --> 02:16:43.639]  We need to have a short impeachment for Joe Biden, but a long impeachment for Merrick Garland.
[02:16:44.740 --> 02:16:50.525]  You know, we've got a lot worked out for us in these midterms, but let there be no doubt, Owen Schroeder is right.
[02:16:50.846 --> 02:16:54.870]  The Democrats are going to try to false flag us here in these final weeks.
[02:16:55.250 --> 02:16:59.274]  Yeah, with just 11 days left, folks, you think it's a coincidence what happened at the Pelosi household?
[02:16:59.774 --> 02:17:00.796]  Somehow, I doubt it.
[02:17:00.956 --> 02:17:02.258]  Ali Alexander, great stuff.
[02:17:02.298 --> 02:17:03.459]  Thank you for joining us today.

[02:18:31.444 --> 02:18:32.665]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:18:32.685 --> 02:18:35.628]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:18:35.708 --> 02:18:41.948]   today because it's the spooky season. It's getting closer to Halloween. I wanted to talk about the
[02:18:41.948 --> 02:18:51.788]   pop culture industry's occult and esoteric and satanic roots. Now I've talked about this in the
[02:18:51.788 --> 02:18:55.468]   past, but this one this talk is going to be a little bit different because I want to start with
[02:18:55.468 --> 02:18:59.788]   the way that this has affected culture, right? We all have heard the term culture war. We know
[02:18:59.788 --> 02:19:06.188]   about the idea of battling our conservative or liberal or whatever perspectives in the social
[02:19:06.188 --> 02:19:09.708]   sphere and the culture sphere and this has been termed the culture war.
[02:19:09.981 --> 02:19:19.107]  But I want to stress and emphasize that you can't really understand this unless you understand that the principles of the state or the corporate state or the elite controlling culture is ancient.
[02:19:19.127 --> 02:19:21.368]  It goes back to the ancient world.
[02:19:22.069 --> 02:19:29.714]  And I've been teaching a course in philosophy, the history of philosophy, which that'll be available to the public in a couple months.
[02:19:30.882 --> 02:19:46.811]  Over at Richard Grove of Tragedy and Hope's excellent site, Autonomy, and in his Autonomy course, we're talking about the history of the Republic, we're talking about Plato, we're talking about, we did a four hour, three or four hour in-depth analysis of this, so we go really deep.
[02:19:47.471 --> 02:19:56.896]  And I was reminded that in the Republic of Plato, we have the idea that society has to be run in a proto-version of technocracy by a secret society.
[02:19:57.944 --> 02:20:04.767]  Now, in The Republic, it's a philosopher king that pretty much rules everything from on high, so it's very autocratic, it's very dictatorial.
[02:20:05.367 --> 02:20:11.929]  But in one of Plato's later works, The Laws, he invents this kind of secret council called the Nocturnal Council.
[02:20:12.930 --> 02:20:19.092]  And hearkening back to The Republic, his earlier work, he mentioned that they would have to rule by the Noble Lie.
[02:20:20.673 --> 02:20:27.760]   The Noble Lie is this concept that the state has to erect Big scale lies to control the masses.
[02:20:28.522 --> 02:20:41.908]  So it's a sort of a justification for why the state, right, by any means necessary, has to maintain control and order, even if that control and order is propped up by intentional, created, big-scale lies.
[02:20:41.988 --> 02:20:46.991]  So we might think that fake news is something modern, but it's actually not.
[02:20:47.071 --> 02:21:16.916]   It's something that is part of the very apparatus of the megastate itself, to concoct big-scale deceptions to hold everybody Under one idea or one line or one piece of propaganda, for example, the British Empire under the Victorian period wholesale adopted Darwinism as its mythos, because if you look at Darwin's own writings, his idea is that the British Empire is the apex of human evolution.
[02:21:17.876 --> 02:21:26.301]  So, if you believed the evolutionary narrative at that time, you believed it because, well, of course, we're the greatest empire, the most evolved empire on the planet.
[02:21:26.381 --> 02:21:30.024]  It's our duty to bring civilization to everyone, right?
[02:21:31.245 --> 02:21:32.786]  That was the mythos of the empire.
[02:21:32.806 --> 02:21:42.492]  And so, likewise, this idea of a concocted, contrived, and controlled mythos has been the purview of the state throughout all of its history.
[02:21:43.343 --> 02:21:50.268]  I think that Christianity comes along, I do think Christianity is true, so it doesn't rely on a wholesale lies and deception.
[02:21:50.548 --> 02:22:02.817]  If you know the history of the Christian Church, for example, there were a lot of kings, a lot of rulers, a lot of members of the state that tried to alter and change Christianity to fit their own status narrative.
[02:22:02.837 --> 02:22:08.361]  Many emperors persecuted the church and tried to have the theology, the doctrine changed, and were never successful.
[02:22:09.071 --> 02:22:15.675]  So I think that there is a unique case here where Christianity does present an authentic religious tradition.
[02:22:16.415 --> 02:22:28.902]  But in so many cases, you know, pagan empires or even today's modern Western imperial approach to trying to govern the world involves constructing and concocting new myths.
[02:22:29.262 --> 02:22:43.768]   And some of the new myths revolve around things like You know, saving the planet, and pollution, and the green agenda, and austerity, and extinction rebellion, and perhaps even something more ridiculous like the alien narrative.
[02:22:43.808 --> 02:22:47.470]  They might use an alien mythology to try to unify everyone.
[02:22:48.410 --> 02:22:51.372]  Or, you know, this external threat narrative of some kind.
[02:22:51.412 --> 02:22:57.294]  So, the global government, right, is in the process of trying to concoct its own mythos.
[02:22:58.179 --> 02:23:02.978]   its own narrative to explain and give everybody some unifying principle. Aldous Huxley wrote a
[02:23:02.978 --> 02:23:08.819]   book called the Perennial Philosophy where he talked about that a kind of generic one-size-fits-all
[02:23:08.819 --> 02:23:15.058]   global new age religion could perhaps be the vehicle which unifies the entire world. So the
[02:23:15.058 --> 02:23:19.459]   new age movement, the idea of a one-world religion that's a blending of all the religions, there's
[02:23:19.459 --> 02:23:20.659]  nothing new to that either.
[02:23:20.854 --> 02:23:23.416]  That's an old imperial approach in the Roman Empire.
[02:23:23.896 --> 02:23:31.021]  You had the attempt to get everybody to believe any religion they wanted as long as they accepted Caesar as divine.
[02:23:31.061 --> 02:23:32.542]  So the final authority is Caesar.
[02:23:33.162 --> 02:23:34.963]  But then you can believe whatever you want.
[02:23:34.983 --> 02:23:36.104]  Look at that dude's rebel eye.
[02:23:36.144 --> 02:23:37.125]  That eye's going wild.
[02:23:37.185 --> 02:23:38.365]  I didn't realize he had such a...
[02:23:40.413 --> 02:23:48.639]  So the Brits are known for rebellious anarchy in their mouth in terms of their teeth, but I guess they have in some cases a rebellious all-seeing eye as well.
[02:23:49.840 --> 02:24:11.993]   Let's get back into this notion then of the secret society element to this because everybody finds this fascinating and they always want to know about secret societies and the reason I bring that up is because in the case of Plato's Republic, He says that there will be going to be this secret society, this inner core group that knows the noble lie isn't the case and knows that it's for the good of the society.
[02:24:13.033 --> 02:24:19.878]  And there's so many great parallels between one of the other prominent images in the Republic, which is the allegory of the cave.
[02:24:20.399 --> 02:24:28.685]  This idea that the average Athenian is sort of held entranced by these images, shadows projected on a cave wall.
[02:24:29.700 --> 02:24:35.522]  And the philosopher, or the guy who's appointed to be the truth teller, who goes and tells them the truth.
[02:24:35.562 --> 02:24:40.544]  You guys were just really entranced by these deceptive shadow images on a cave wall.
[02:24:40.905 --> 02:24:45.506]  He's actually seeing the real sun, the real light, and not this manufactured light in the cave.
[02:24:46.167 --> 02:24:50.648]  He tries to tell them, and they get mad, and they've lost their reasoning faculty, and they want to kill him.
[02:24:50.748 --> 02:25:07.340]   And this is the allegory of the cave, which is intended to Elucidate this principle behind platonic theology and platonic metaphysics, but it's applicable perfectly to today's Hollywood Matrix Netflix society, right?
[02:25:07.420 --> 02:25:10.482]  It's the exact same kind of illusory reality.
[02:25:11.295 --> 02:25:31.617]  And it's just as dominated by inner secret society cults as the ancient world was, or as the empires were, or even as Plato himself says, which is a kind of an ironic contradiction, that Plato has this idea that the philosopher comes to the cave to try to awaken people, to try to wake them up, enlighten them.
[02:25:32.157 --> 02:25:43.185]  And yet, at the same time, Plato believes that most people aren't going to wake up, and so the Republic of Plato requires this big lie, this inner core elite group that's going to run it together with the philosopher king.
[02:25:44.125 --> 02:25:47.147]  So, what about Hollywood, though?
[02:25:47.167 --> 02:25:55.733]  Well, Hollywood is very similar to this kind of a mechanism, and this would be all of pop culture, really, the cathedral that is pop culture.
[02:25:56.750 --> 02:26:02.273]  Because it's really borrowing from a lot of the ancient occult and esoteric mystery school ideas.
[02:26:02.893 --> 02:26:11.097]  So, for example, most Hollywood films that are in some way dealing with God or the divine or something like this, they're very gnostic in their theology.
[02:26:11.117 --> 02:26:21.962]  And what I mean by that is that they present the idea of an evil creator God who's imprisoned us and that through the right amount of gnosis or knowledge, we can escape this world.
[02:26:22.651 --> 02:26:25.517]  You know, something like simulation theory or the Matrix.
[02:26:25.577 --> 02:26:28.162]  Everybody thinks of the Matrix as a classic example of this.
[02:26:28.857 --> 02:26:36.343]  And it's fine to see an analogy in some of these movies, like The Matrix, you know, telling us about waking up out of a deceptive system.
[02:26:36.763 --> 02:26:43.929]  But if we think that the world really is a prison, then we have some problems in a lot of our approaches to ethics and morals.
[02:26:44.410 --> 02:26:58.321]  And the left, and that's what I want to get to today, and how modern leftism really comes out of this counterculture Hollywood scene and Hollywood ideology, and the music industry as well, it's all part of the same superstructure.
[02:26:59.085 --> 02:27:08.130]  Um, is itself kind of an initiation process into an inversion of everything that is good, everything that is truth, everything that is beautiful, everything that is justice, etc.
[02:27:08.530 --> 02:27:37.135]   This is an initiation process, a counter-initiation into something very deceptive, destructive, and only serves the ends of the oligarchical elite and perhaps even something beyond a satanic Being or entity who is the source of evil in the world who is the source of the deception and the darkness and the delusion and the desire to destroy to kill what is easy to say or the thief comes to steal kill and destroy and he's talking there about the devil.
[02:27:38.356 --> 02:27:40.519]  Now I'm not being a prudish sort of a.
[02:27:41.218 --> 02:27:41.819]  Puritan here.
[02:27:41.879 --> 02:27:43.460]  I'm not saying it's wrong to watch movies.
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:46.443]  I'm not saying it's wrong to, you know, be into the arts.
[02:27:46.503 --> 02:27:52.109]  I mean, the history of Western civilization, the history of Byzantine civilization was very much into the arts.
[02:27:52.129 --> 02:27:53.210]  There's a lot of beautiful art.
[02:27:53.230 --> 02:27:54.891]  It doesn't have to be religious art.
[02:27:54.911 --> 02:27:56.073]  It can be all kinds of different things.
[02:27:56.113 --> 02:28:02.058]  But there has to be some strictures and some ideas as to what constitutes beauty in an objective sense.
[02:28:02.118 --> 02:28:03.640]  It can't be totally relativized.
[02:28:04.218 --> 02:28:11.244]  Because when it's totally relativized, that only suggests or conveys the idea that there is no truth, there is no beauty, there is no goodness, there is no justice.
[02:28:11.284 --> 02:28:12.846]  It's all relative to the individual.
[02:28:12.866 --> 02:28:23.722]   So we're going to talk about the philosophy of leftism first and how its modern versions come out of This Matrix of Hollywood and Secret Societies.
[02:28:23.762 --> 02:28:24.242]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:28:24.282 --> 02:28:25.143]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:25.603 --> 02:28:26.804]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:26.824 --> 02:28:28.905]  I wanted to give a brief, this is Jay Dyer of Jason Ellis.
[02:28:28.925 --> 02:28:33.629]  I want to give a brief discussion of how the left got to being so crazy.
[02:28:33.729 --> 02:28:39.013]  Kind of a philosophical demolishing and presubstantial critique of leftism.
[02:28:39.053 --> 02:28:40.074]  And why are they so crazy?
[02:28:40.114 --> 02:28:41.675]  Why do they act the way they do?
[02:28:41.755 --> 02:28:45.638]  You know, where you go to a campus and they just start screaming and they're yelling in your face.
[02:28:46.556 --> 02:28:51.899]  You're trying to reason with them, and they don't care about your facts, your logic, your reasoning, right?
[02:28:52.359 --> 02:28:53.200]  Why is it that way?
[02:28:53.280 --> 02:29:22.909]   Well, we have to understand that the origins of revolutionary leftism, liberalism in the way that we think of it today, It does have a specific ideological lineage and origin, and a lot of things could be pointed to, but in my assessment, overall, what we're looking at is a latest stage manifestation of earlier versions of revolutionary positions and revolutionary ideas that have just sort of morphed in their own way to trying to, in a way, be consistent.
[02:29:22.949 --> 02:29:27.832]  But this is ironic because this whole position does not actually believe that there is such a thing as logic.
[02:29:28.453 --> 02:29:29.154]  Objective truth.
[02:29:29.174 --> 02:29:37.309]  So the first thing we want to note is that leftism specifically does not believe that there is truth.
[02:29:38.204 --> 02:29:43.648]  One of the most famous modern leftist thinkers and philosophers and literary critics, actually.
[02:29:43.668 --> 02:29:44.889]  His name is Umberto Eco.
[02:29:45.589 --> 02:29:49.912]  And he wrote that famous novel, The Name of the Rose, which has Sean Connery.
[02:29:50.613 --> 02:29:59.079]  And the movie version has Sean Connery and Christian Slater, who's always trying to act like Jack Nicholson, right, as monks.
[02:29:59.559 --> 02:30:01.981]  This is not very believable, these two people as monks.
[02:30:03.615 --> 02:30:25.960]  The story revolves around them going to be basically two detectives at a monastery in the Middle Ages where there was a murder, and there's a lot of occultic and esoteric elements going on, as is usually the case in Echo's novels, but the story ends with, spoiler alert, with the monastery basically burning down, and it's representative for the entire ancient and medieval view that there is such a thing as truth.
[02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:34.504]   And when the monastery burns down, basically the point is that there really isn't anything Divine or supernatural at all going on.
[02:30:35.445 --> 02:30:38.247]  It's all just another kind of a trick or deception.
[02:30:38.327 --> 02:30:46.814]  So the odd thing here is that leftism begins with or has had this tendency in history to be conspiratorial.
[02:30:48.555 --> 02:30:55.181]  And so it has this tendency to think that there's really just a constant conspiracy going on of the elites tricking everybody.
[02:30:55.961 --> 02:30:57.983]  And we kind of see that in Plato where that's admitted.
[02:30:58.644 --> 02:31:08.333]  But at the same time, while they're on a crusade for freedom or for liberty or for truth, so they say, they're also admitting that there is no such thing as freedom, liberty, or truth.
[02:31:08.753 --> 02:31:10.635]  Those things don't actually objectively exist.
[02:31:11.676 --> 02:31:20.283]  And Eco himself has a famous essay that he wrote called Ur-Fascism, which is, what's the idea of perpetual fascism?
[02:31:20.303 --> 02:31:20.884]  What does that mean?
[02:31:21.730 --> 02:31:33.215]  And he says that, you know, the battle of the leftists, talking about himself and everybody as a leftist, he says it's not principally against political positions or fascism in a political sense.
[02:31:34.135 --> 02:31:42.179]  He says the real battle of the leftists is ideological, philosophical, and it pertains to the war against truth itself.
[02:31:43.139 --> 02:31:54.734]   So he's a much more self-cognizant, self-aware leftist philosopher, thinker, semiotician, Fiction writer, professor, etc.
[02:31:55.095 --> 02:31:59.257]  By noting that, guys, we're not really in a war against political factions.
[02:31:59.617 --> 02:32:03.219]  We're in a war against the idea that there even is a thing called truth at all.
[02:32:04.620 --> 02:32:10.743]  And that helps us understand, you know, classic left manuals, you know, like Saul Alinsky, right?
[02:32:11.203 --> 02:32:12.024]  Rules for Radicals.
[02:32:12.704 --> 02:32:16.046]  Where there's not, there's a principle of revolution for revolution's sake.
[02:32:17.774 --> 02:32:22.618]  A lot of the Marxists, for example, they would talk about critique and revolution for critique's sake.
[02:32:25.300 --> 02:32:36.489]  And so what characterizes the tendency of revolutionary leftist ideology, modus operandi, the praxis, is a war ultimately against the idea of truth itself.
[02:32:37.230 --> 02:32:41.834]  There's a great book by an Orthodox priest and philosopher, Fr.
[02:32:41.854 --> 02:32:50.820]   Seraphim Rose, which I did a lecture on here in the fourth hour a couple years ago, called Nihilism of the Roots of the Modern Revolution.
[02:32:50.960 --> 02:32:59.282]  And in that book, Father Severum Rose classifies and characterizes the historical stages of revolutionary leftism.
[02:33:00.122 --> 02:33:16.825]  And the final stage, beyond the attempt to enact the universal ideals that a lot of leftists at some point perhaps believed in or professed to believe in or thought that they were championing, he says it kind of collapses because they realize that, wait a minute, I'm trying to impose an idea on other people.
[02:33:17.566 --> 02:33:20.448]  But I don't believe in imposing ideas on other people, so wait a minute.
[02:33:21.249 --> 02:33:25.432]  And who, of course, does that book have its dedication to?
[02:33:25.493 --> 02:33:42.146]  Well, none other than Lucifer or Satan himself, the first revolutionary, the first rebel, the first challenger, right, who said, supposedly, at least it's attributed in Milton, right, that he would rather reign in hell than be a servant in heaven, right?
[02:33:42.166 --> 02:33:54.399]   So this idea that Revolution can occur and achieve perfect equality, perfect egalitarianism for everybody.
[02:33:55.342 --> 02:33:57.644]  Is a totally delusional, right?
[02:33:57.684 --> 02:33:58.985]  It's absolutely impossible.
[02:33:59.065 --> 02:34:07.792]  And I think smarter leftists and the money that's typically behind leftism and socialism, these kinds of revolutionary ideas, they're pretty much self-aware.
[02:34:07.832 --> 02:34:13.656]  They're smart enough to realize that you cannot achieve total and absolute equality.
[02:34:14.197 --> 02:34:17.680]  And that would actually lead to a kind of dystopian nightmare.
[02:34:17.700 --> 02:34:21.342]  But some of the people who believe this kind of stuff are fine with a dystopian nightmare.
[02:34:21.643 --> 02:34:28.083]   So there's actually this sort of, as Father Rose points out, this implicit self-destructive
[02:34:28.083 --> 02:34:33.481]  motivation in revolutionary nihilism and leftism.
[02:34:33.481 --> 02:34:39.682]   It ends up not just in trying to promote ideals, but in wanting to destroy for the sake of
[02:34:39.682 --> 02:34:40.682]  destruction.
[02:34:40.682 --> 02:34:47.002]   And in that sense, there is a demonic motivation that's going on here.
[02:34:47.049 --> 02:34:54.491]  Even, I'm not saying that every leftist is literally possessed, although some of them seem to be demonstrating the manifestations of actual demonic possession now.
[02:34:54.571 --> 02:34:56.071]  Because again, these things go in stages.
[02:34:56.091 --> 02:35:02.973]  So you kind of reach this final phase of liberal revolutionary leftism, nihilism, or whatever, where you're just possessed.
[02:35:03.653 --> 02:35:07.894]  And not only do you try to kill everybody, but you also will your own destruction.
[02:35:09.074 --> 02:35:09.494]  Suicide.
[02:35:10.654 --> 02:35:12.695]  Or suicide on a cultural scale.
[02:35:14.188 --> 02:35:21.171]  And that is the motivation and modus operandi of the demonic side of leftism.
[02:35:21.691 --> 02:35:23.192]  And that's what you're seeing today.
[02:35:25.433 --> 02:35:36.818]  This notion that, and it's such a powerful controlling delusion, that not only do you have to negate and destroy and tear down everything else, why not also tear down yourself?
[02:35:37.479 --> 02:35:59.988]   Because it ends up being not just a battle against externals, At a certain point, the leftist believes that not only is everything oppressing him and must everything be torn down, he himself exists as part of this world and part of this structure, and he can't completely remove himself from the world from everything outside of him that is supposedly oppressing him and is the source of his ills.
[02:36:01.068 --> 02:36:05.249]  Doesn't it seem to logically follow then that suicide is the next logical step?
[02:36:05.369 --> 02:36:09.371]  And believe it or not, there have been many left philosophers who have actually argued that.
[02:36:09.471 --> 02:36:09.991]  I'm not kidding.
[02:36:10.794 --> 02:36:22.962]  Some of the famous existentialist philosophers, notoriously radical leftists, actually made the logical, philosophical case for killing yourself and committing suicide.
[02:36:22.982 --> 02:36:27.264]  That that was the final and most true, pure revolutionary act.
[02:36:28.045 --> 02:36:32.948]  Well, I don't know why we're supposed to be pure in any of these systems, because there is no such thing as purity.
[02:36:33.348 --> 02:36:35.329]  There is no such thing as logic or consistency.
[02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:38.491]  There's no morals or standards that anyone is bound to.
[02:36:38.551 --> 02:36:44.963]   So it makes no sense But that's precisely why it is a fundamental self-destructive contradiction.
[02:36:47.445 --> 02:36:54.310]  And so understand that leftism is a power oppressor narrative and nothing to do with truth and falsehood.
[02:36:54.850 --> 02:37:03.237]  Truth and falsehood, according to the leftist approach and their tweeting and their journalism and their media, those are only weapons.
[02:37:04.478 --> 02:37:06.159]  And they're interchangeable with the opponents.
[02:37:06.799 --> 02:37:07.860]  More on this when we get back.
[02:37:08.020 --> 02:37:09.001]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:10.126 --> 02:37:11.307]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:11.327 --> 02:37:13.429]  This is your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:37:13.449 --> 02:37:29.602]  We were talking about the destruction and self-negation that occurred in the arts and how this is part of a cultural warfare that is more than just, you know, this or that think tank or that foundation or whatever or money to group.
[02:37:29.683 --> 02:37:32.385]  It's actually a spiritual battle that goes back a long time.
[02:37:33.337 --> 02:37:37.980]  And the difference being that it has now been more or less scientifically perfected and weaponized.
[02:37:38.020 --> 02:37:42.023]  I'm speaking of the toxic culture that is a form of psychological warfare.
[02:37:42.043 --> 02:37:49.808]  And I was going into the history of how we got to where we are in terms of liberal philosophy, revolutionary philosophy, leftism.
[02:37:51.029 --> 02:37:53.831]  And we talked in the last segment about how there is no objective truth.
[02:37:53.911 --> 02:37:55.452]  Truth is purely relative.
[02:37:56.101 --> 02:37:56.662]  In their view.
[02:37:56.722 --> 02:38:06.110]  So we want to understand this because, again, a lot of people interact with radical leftists on Twitter or their family members at Thanksgiving dinner and whatever, and they're mystified.
[02:38:06.311 --> 02:38:07.572]  Why aren't you listening to reason?
[02:38:07.592 --> 02:38:08.953]  You're not listening to the logic.
[02:38:08.993 --> 02:38:24.603]   Well, we saw this kind of completely go out the window, I would say, around 2015-16 when people would go to demonstrations, Trump rallies or whatever, and leftists were throwing They're throwing urine, they're throwing bike locks at your face.
[02:38:24.923 --> 02:38:27.105]  They're not interested in your facts and logic.
[02:38:27.125 --> 02:38:28.586]  Well, how do we get to that point?
[02:38:29.267 --> 02:38:49.644]  Well, again, there's this impetus, there's this motivation that either progresses over time and gets worse and worse and worse, or we begin to come to our senses, we repent, we have a change of heart, change of mind, by God's grace or something like this, that moves us more in the direction of truth, or we move away into this direction of more and more self-destruction.
[02:38:50.931 --> 02:38:57.033]  And so you have to understand that for a lot of the left, they have capitulated into believing in self-destruction.
[02:38:57.253 --> 02:39:03.214]  They're fine with sterilization, euthanasia, cult of death, right?
[02:39:03.254 --> 02:39:04.215]  Culture of death, all of that.
[02:39:04.235 --> 02:39:04.975]  They're fine with that.
[02:39:05.775 --> 02:39:13.997]  And so apart from, you know, a big event that causes repentance of people's heart or something like that, you're not going to convince these people with logic.
[02:39:14.677 --> 02:39:17.158]  You're not going to because they have surrendered their reasoning faculty.
[02:39:18.405 --> 02:39:21.909]  And it is possible to do that, and they're not going to listen to reason anymore.
[02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:26.593]  And so it's very unfortunate because so many people are given over to this, right?
[02:39:26.613 --> 02:39:27.594]  It's a kind of a delusion.
[02:39:27.654 --> 02:39:34.241]  It's a kind of an irrational, just a completely berserker kind of state that they go into.
[02:39:34.261 --> 02:39:41.128]  They're triggered, and they become these sort of frothing demonic creatures, and you can't reason with them, and you're never going to reason with them.
[02:39:42.961 --> 02:39:53.226]  And so we got to that point because of the tearing down of structures, the tearing down of everything which is perceived to be, in their distorted minds, the source of their troubles.
[02:39:53.806 --> 02:40:00.309]  And so there's this weird impulse amongst the left or leftist revolutionary thought and thinking to be messianic.
[02:40:01.585 --> 02:40:02.985]  You said, well, but they don't believe in God.
[02:40:03.026 --> 02:40:04.186]  They're kind of, you know, weird.
[02:40:04.226 --> 02:40:05.946]  And why would they be messianic?
[02:40:05.986 --> 02:40:25.152]  Well, if you don't believe in God and you don't believe in the transcendent or any of these kinds of principles, what typically happens is that you then sort of out of your own ego and narcissistic impulse, believe that it's your job now as a revolutionary activist to save the planet, to save everyone, to bring freedom, liberation and all these things.
[02:40:26.053 --> 02:40:32.484]   So you say, but the irony is that, first of all, as we said in the last segment, What are these principles that you're fighting for?
[02:40:33.684 --> 02:40:35.145]  What is the freedom that you're fighting for?
[02:40:35.445 --> 02:40:36.605]  Liberty to what?
[02:40:36.945 --> 02:40:37.805]  Freedom from what?
[02:40:38.806 --> 02:40:40.426]  Well, what are the things you're fighting for?
[02:40:40.646 --> 02:40:40.967]  Freedom?
[02:40:40.987 --> 02:40:41.447]  Free will?
[02:40:41.667 --> 02:40:43.327]  Freedom to do anything?
[02:40:44.288 --> 02:40:46.188]  So it's completely inconsistent.
[02:40:46.208 --> 02:40:51.890]  There's no logical, consistent reasoning or basis on the leftist worldview as to why you would want to do these things.
[02:40:52.690 --> 02:41:05.315]   Because they turn around and say that everybody who doesn't follow this version of leftism is a fascist, is intolerant, And then they want to beat you into submission for their position.
[02:41:06.496 --> 02:41:11.417]  Now, again, as we said, they know, I think deep down, that that's not consistent.
[02:41:11.457 --> 02:41:12.317]  It's a contradiction.
[02:41:12.977 --> 02:41:14.818]  But they don't care that they contradict.
[02:41:14.938 --> 02:41:17.999]  Because remember, in this worldview, there's no such thing as truth or falsehood.
[02:41:18.779 --> 02:41:27.782]  Truth and falsehood are just weapons of warfare that are used because, in their view, everything is just oppressor-oppressed narratives.
[02:41:27.842 --> 02:41:28.082]  That's it.
[02:41:29.517 --> 02:41:35.259]  And so the way that you win in this kind of a battle isn't really having the truth on your side, because there is no truth.
[02:41:35.940 --> 02:41:37.901]  It's all just oppressor-oppressed narratives.
[02:41:38.441 --> 02:41:49.385]  And that's why they have moved into this new phase now where, from their perspective, logic and math are Western patriarchal narratives that are created to oppress people.
[02:41:51.226 --> 02:41:57.849]  I mean, that is so absurd that it's almost like mind-boggling to argue against that.
[02:41:58.573 --> 02:42:03.577]  Because it is so self-evidently absurd and self-reputing, right?
[02:42:03.597 --> 02:42:09.902]  Because they're using logic and reasoning to say there is no logic and reasoning at all, and they don't even realize that much of it, right?
[02:42:10.282 --> 02:42:19.089]  And so if you were to try to explain it to them, they don't care, and they're only interested in turning everything into a power oppressor guilt narrative, you see.
[02:42:19.668 --> 02:42:33.941]  So it's all just a weapon to try to use guilt as a way to psychologically manipulate you into cowering, submitting, feeling bad, and then they feel like they have power, right?
[02:42:33.982 --> 02:42:38.506]  So it's a grasping for power is really what all of this amounts to.
[02:42:39.426 --> 02:42:42.509]  Because they really believe that everything is just power narratives.
[02:42:42.650 --> 02:42:51.179]  And that comes out of a lot of sociologists in the last century who did sociological analysis of power oppressor narratives.
[02:42:51.219 --> 02:42:55.243]  Many of them were Marxists and they were couching it in a class warfare struggle.
[02:42:55.603 --> 02:43:22.828]   Well, that class warfare struggle narrative has pretty much collapsed into Post-modernism, which many of the left adopted this idea that there isn't really any truth or false, so there are no grand narratives and even classical liberalism and classical enlightenment, universal ideas that there's a universal justice, that there's a universal liberty that man should strive, universal morals that everyone should strive for from these enlightenment philosophers like Kant, right?
[02:43:23.269 --> 02:43:24.570]  Categorical imperative of Kant.
[02:43:24.970 --> 02:43:33.452]  No, that's even been deconstructed, because remember, leftism is about constantly critiquing and deconstructing everything, even the leftism of the generation before you.
[02:43:34.013 --> 02:43:38.394]  Culture critique, that is one of the Frankfurt School mottos of critical theory.
[02:43:40.534 --> 02:43:42.555]  Never-ending struggle, right?
[02:43:42.635 --> 02:43:45.196]  Mao, Lenin, they both talked about that, for example.
[02:43:45.256 --> 02:43:46.996]  So you have to constantly tear down.
[02:43:47.396 --> 02:43:49.177]  You can never stop tearing down.
[02:43:50.154 --> 02:43:55.177]  But the logic of that means that everything must be torn down, even the new left themselves.
[02:43:55.297 --> 02:43:59.379]  Every generation of leftists must destroy the previous generation of leftists.
[02:44:00.739 --> 02:44:09.164]  And so it's preposterous, it's insane, it's a philosophy of madness, but they don't care.
[02:44:09.564 --> 02:44:12.986]  Because as soon as you try to point that out, they don't care.
[02:44:13.046 --> 02:44:17.528]  Because they're impelled by more than ideology.
[02:44:18.925 --> 02:44:24.148]  But by this kind of spirit that they partake of, which impels them to self-destruction.
[02:44:25.648 --> 02:44:29.170]  It's an enslaving spirit to the passions.
[02:44:30.371 --> 02:44:35.533]  And I don't mean passions in a romanticist sense of, you know, passionate plays or artworks.
[02:44:35.573 --> 02:44:44.578]  No, I'm talking about the passions in the ancient sense, the ancient world, the way Plato or some of the Orthodox Church fathers spoke of the passions as vices that enslave us.
[02:44:45.825 --> 02:44:54.470]  The only thing a lot of these leftists are willing to fight for and die for, the only thing they stand for, is their degenerate addictions to various passions.
[02:44:55.210 --> 02:44:57.831]  And I'm not just calling them out, because all of us struggle with the passion.
[02:44:57.891 --> 02:45:01.914]  It's a feature of human existence due to the fall.
[02:45:02.034 --> 02:45:04.895]  We're all going to be battling the vices.
[02:45:05.015 --> 02:45:18.613]   But the more that you capitulate to the vices, I'm saying, the more that you become enslaved, and the more that, ironically, Wealthy, powerful elites can use vices to enslave an entire people.
[02:45:19.473 --> 02:45:23.634]  And that's that psychological warfare element that is a big part of this.
[02:45:23.674 --> 02:45:26.255]  So we've seen that leftism inherently tears down.
[02:45:27.215 --> 02:45:32.616]  And not just tears down all the structures in the previous generation of leftists before them, but it has to tear down ultimately even the self.
[02:45:34.297 --> 02:45:37.317]  And this is how leftism transforms into post-humanism.
[02:45:37.958 --> 02:45:51.793]   After the left adopted The idea of postmodernism, that everything is really just oppressor, oppressive narratives in terms of who had the best story and who had the most power, right?
[02:45:51.933 --> 02:45:53.954]  It becomes a kind of a Nietzschean thing, right?
[02:45:54.355 --> 02:45:54.835]  Ironically.
[02:45:55.375 --> 02:46:06.023]  Then it becomes a situation where now the problem isn't political ideologies, the problem isn't leftism, conservatism, the problem isn't fascism, capitalism.
[02:46:06.767 --> 02:46:08.288]  The problem is man himself.
[02:46:08.709 --> 02:46:09.849]  Humanity is the problem.
[02:46:09.869 --> 02:46:24.541]  That is the most advanced version of the leftist philosophy, and that is why they are all to a man anti-human, anti-natalist, and believe that humanity itself must be overcome for all of these problems to be solved.
[02:46:24.561 --> 02:46:30.105]  Do you see the dark logic in how this is 100% obviously a satanic agenda?
[02:46:31.617 --> 02:46:34.462]  The humankind needs to be gotten rid of, you see.
[02:46:34.662 --> 02:46:36.004]  That's the logic of their system.
[02:46:36.025 --> 02:46:37.026]  That's what they actually say.
[02:46:37.507 --> 02:46:43.958]  All of these post-humanist transhumanists, they are the most advanced form of the leftist revolutionary self-negating philosophy.
[02:46:46.095 --> 02:46:53.138]  In the next segment, when we come back, we're going to talk about how this manifested in movies and pop culture in occult Hollywood.
[02:46:53.178 --> 02:46:53.698]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:46:53.818 --> 02:46:54.758]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:46:54.778 --> 02:46:56.799]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:46:56.819 --> 02:47:07.343]  We were just covering the history of revolutionary self-destruction and how radical leftism is a tool to further the Overton window.
[02:47:07.363 --> 02:47:24.913]   This is another point I want to get to that I didn't get to, which is that, you know, a lot of people wonder, well, you know, nobody really follows these radical, you know, eco groups or the Extinction Rebellion people, you know, they look ridiculous, but that's their purpose is actually move the center more to the left.
[02:47:25.053 --> 02:47:25.854]  That's their purpose.
[02:47:25.894 --> 02:47:48.056]   So, I think a lot of oligarchical elite know that, you know, these radical environmentalist people, the radical green people, the, you know, animal rights, the vegans, and these kinds of people, when they do their approaches, when they do these kinds of things, It's not that the elite believe that the majority of the population is actually going to come to believe those radical views.
[02:47:48.877 --> 02:48:07.411]  But the purpose of the radical pushing the line even further out, right, even if they look fringe, is that what that does is it has the effect of making what is the center position, the logical, quote, centrist position, be more main, more towards the left, you see.
[02:48:08.197 --> 02:48:13.238]  That's the whole purpose of those kinds of groups is to just, as many of you probably know, move the Overton window.
[02:48:14.719 --> 02:48:30.383]  And so that's an example of how these groups are used by very wealthy, very powerful people who have more or less adopted a completely anti-human, a completely anti-natalist type of position.
[02:48:31.252 --> 02:48:32.853]  Most of the of the wealthy elite, right?
[02:48:32.893 --> 02:48:38.735]  We see a little bit of a kind of a reaction to this, I guess, in some of the today's billionaires with some of the news is coming out.
[02:48:39.035 --> 02:48:44.917]  But for the most part, the majority of the zillionaire billionaire class, you know, they don't have any.
[02:48:45.317 --> 02:48:46.618]  They're completely anti-human.
[02:48:46.638 --> 02:48:53.420]  They're completely 100 percent on board with and the major promoters and funders of the great reset transhumanist agenda.
[02:48:54.028 --> 02:48:56.289]  But where did this really come into the culture?
[02:48:56.309 --> 02:48:57.889]  I mean, was it the 60s?
[02:48:57.949 --> 02:48:59.230]  Was it the music industry?
[02:48:59.310 --> 02:49:00.270]  Was it Hollywood?
[02:49:00.330 --> 02:49:01.251]  It was all of these things.
[02:49:02.551 --> 02:49:14.355]  And one of the key figures that, for whatever reason, I mean, I have my theories, that Hollywood was able to do this was by their acceptance of a Crowleyan type of philosophy.
[02:49:14.415 --> 02:49:37.908]   Now, not everybody in Hollywood was into Aleister Crowley or 100% adopted his philosophy, but he did seem to, in a weird way, become this Counterculture ahead of time icon and I believe that it was because of his connections and associations with British intelligence and that kind of thrust him into being this potential figure to use as a counterculture icon.
[02:49:38.519 --> 02:49:44.348]  And as somebody who would push the Overton window way, way, way, way ahead back in his day.
[02:49:44.429 --> 02:49:53.443]  So he was kind of one of these pioneering radical figures from an optics perspective back in his day as the most famous, you know, Satanist in the world.
[02:49:54.432 --> 02:50:08.558]  And so, you know, today's eco-radical types of people, in a way, are kind of like him in that they're used, again, to push the narrative into a centrist, liberal perspective, you see.
[02:50:09.038 --> 02:50:19.723]  So even though not everybody in Crowley's day accepted the radical things that he was teaching and promoting and doing, nowadays, what he did is seen as the norm.
[02:50:21.636 --> 02:50:34.877]  And so it's very possible if we continue to slide into chaos and self-destruction that the crazy stuff that the Extinction Rebellion people are doing in 50, 40 years will be the norm then.
[02:50:35.655 --> 02:50:35.835]  Right.
[02:50:35.875 --> 02:50:38.696]  We'll be in full on total technocratic dystopia.
[02:50:39.176 --> 02:50:45.098]  But if you doubt any of what I'm talking about, you'll notice that I've done many interviews in the past with people in this domain.
[02:50:45.198 --> 02:50:58.242]  I did a specific really long interview with Dr. Richard Spence, who the famous academic who wrote a text called Secret Agent 666, where he shows the history of Crowley as a MI5 British intelligence asset.
[02:50:58.832 --> 02:51:03.895]  And so that could be part of the reason why he was used in this cultural war as well.
[02:51:04.035 --> 02:51:13.742]  So a lot of the theology and the ideas that Crowley had were very revolutionary and were very into sexual promiscuity and degeneracy, for example.
[02:51:13.762 --> 02:51:21.769]   So this idea of inverting and turning sexuality into a Completely different tool for society than what it was seen to be.
[02:51:21.789 --> 02:51:26.574]  You know, the means of propagating the species, the means of having a relationship between a man and a woman, etc.
[02:51:26.594 --> 02:51:27.535]  A loving relationship.
[02:51:27.956 --> 02:51:37.946]  For this, for Crowley, it becomes a means of power and dominance and self-aggrandizement to the point of apotheosis or the individual becoming God.
[02:51:38.006 --> 02:51:39.368]  That's his approach to it.
[02:51:40.012 --> 02:51:50.629]  Now, in modern society, sexuality has been successfully divorced, for most people, from the classical traditional means of what it's used for.
[02:51:50.689 --> 02:51:54.555]  And I mean this in the sense of Western Christian civilization when I say traditional or classical.
[02:51:55.422 --> 02:52:04.709]  And a lot of the figures who were countercultural icons, the people that promoted and expanded LSD, for example, somebody like Timothy Leary.
[02:52:04.729 --> 02:52:20.602]  Well, if you read Timothy Leary's books, he talks about how great Crowley was and how great, how influential Alistair Crowley was on him in putting out LSD to everybody with the assistance of the CIA to initiate people.
[02:52:21.417 --> 02:52:37.798]  That's the terminology used, not just by Tim Leary, but also by people like Terrence McKenna, to initiate people into a new way of thinking, a new paradigm, a new esoteric and occultic, they even call it, both of them at times, a shamanic initiation ritual.
[02:52:38.504 --> 02:52:50.794]  Terrence McKenna, for example, in Food of the Gods says, we're going to have to initiate everybody into a kind of shamanic religion that gets rid of the patriarchal religions of the past.
[02:52:50.834 --> 02:52:51.775]  That's literally what he says.
[02:52:51.835 --> 02:53:27.991]   So Logos religion, a religion of objective truth, reason, of a patriarchal tradition, has to be destroyed, torn down, and dispensed with Through a Dionysian-Bacchanalian return, again the terms used by Terence McKenna himself, if we return to a kind of frenzy, a kind of shamanic initiation centered around the forces of nature, the mother goddess, that's his terms again, not mine, and possession,
[02:53:29.111 --> 02:53:36.439]  Literal possession by the spirits of nature, the spirits of ayahuasca, the spirits of LSD, the spirits of all these kinds of drugs.
[02:53:37.340 --> 02:53:49.753]  That will initiate us into a more humane, a more ecologically oriented society where we honor Mother Gaia, where we honor Mother Earth, where we don't engage in warfare.
[02:53:50.589 --> 02:53:53.011]  This is what these people taught.
[02:53:53.111 --> 02:53:56.493]  Now, their own lives, of course, don't reflect that at all, right?
[02:53:56.553 --> 02:54:03.637]  All of these people were complete degenerates and did whatever the heck they wanted to, so they didn't do what they preached, right?
[02:54:04.778 --> 02:54:06.719]  At least in most regards.
[02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:26.326]   But what they did succeed in doing was, through the idea of liberation and freedom, again, which are never defined, we never know exactly what those things are, they did succeed in unleashing Toxic culture that more or less enslaved future generations.
[02:54:27.226 --> 02:54:36.369]  And so nobody could conceive, for example, in, say, the 1960s of, you know, Marilyn Manson and the kinds of concerts that he put on in the 90s, right, in the 1960s.
[02:54:36.429 --> 02:54:43.528]   But if you had to have the 1960s and, you know, the True.
[02:54:44.048 --> 02:54:57.474]  The Church of Satan, for example, in San Francisco, Anton LaVey, which is, again, kind of a, you know, theatrical Hollywood connected puppet show in a way to be out there in the culture to, again, begin to warm people up to this kind of an idea.
[02:54:57.614 --> 02:55:14.905]   And so a few generations later, you can have Marilyn Manson in the 1990s doing very outrageous and sort of Culturally, socially provocative things, which the Satanists themselves call theater of brutality or a form of aesthetic warfare.
[02:55:15.126 --> 02:55:19.229]  So, they're cognizant of those things being a kind of initiation.
[02:55:19.629 --> 02:55:25.034]  The 1960s occultists and esoteric boomers said that what they were doing was a kind of ritual initiation.
[02:55:26.055 --> 02:55:34.462]  And then by today's pop culture, you have just the next phase of this initiatory process into a return to total paganism.
[02:55:35.111 --> 02:55:36.352]  And total enslavement.
[02:55:37.033 --> 02:55:51.944]  So the irony is that none of what is being sold to everyone, again, you had for example in Hollywood all of these figures who were the auteurs and the avant-garde people like Kenneth Anger promoting all the Krolian satanic stuff in their films.
[02:55:51.964 --> 02:55:55.787]  A generation or two ahead of what's in Hollywood now, which is totally satanic, openly.
[02:55:56.491 --> 02:55:56.691]  Right?
[02:55:56.991 --> 02:55:59.834]  For so long people talked about this, and you were gaslighted.
[02:55:59.974 --> 02:56:00.915]  Oh, you're crazy!
[02:56:00.935 --> 02:56:03.136]  Ooh, satanic panic!
[02:56:03.196 --> 02:56:06.219]  That was a stupid thing in the 80s that Christians made up!
[02:56:06.279 --> 02:56:17.848]  Well, there might have been some crazy stuff that Christians and evangelicals made up in the 1980s, but there really were satanic cults and movements, and the culture was being engineered and moved in this direction.
[02:56:17.888 --> 02:56:24.633]  The very founders of the counterculture themselves said that they liked and were very into and immersed in the satanic.
[02:56:25.410 --> 02:56:29.978]  And that could mean anything from Anton LaVey to Michael Aquino to Aleister Crowley.
[02:56:30.118 --> 02:56:31.080]  It could mean any of those things.
[02:56:34.235 --> 02:56:36.836]  So, you have to understand that this is a warfare on you.
[02:56:36.957 --> 02:56:42.840]  This is a warfare on family, on the principles of truth, beauty, and justice themselves.
[02:56:43.320 --> 02:56:45.141]  In the minds of these people, those things don't exist.
[02:56:45.821 --> 02:56:57.168]  And in their mind, the destruction that they will bring in their great cleansing, their calling, their cataclysm that they want to happen, they think that will initiate a future, a better aeon.
[02:56:57.488 --> 02:57:02.871]  So, they have the exact same view, by the way, as the transhumanists, and many of the transhumanists are Luciferian and Satanic.
[02:57:03.331 --> 02:57:05.892]  And so this is the purpose of the toxic culture.
[02:57:06.592 --> 02:57:23.436]  It is not for freedom or liberty, it is to destroy everything that exists right now to bring in a new aeon or a new time wherein they think it will be an aeon of transhumanist, post-human, apotheosis, the aeon of the crown and conquering child who is the new man.
[02:57:23.995 --> 02:57:28.475]   That's the real purpose of all that and I guarantee you if you look at it, you'll see that that's the case.
[02:57:28.475 --> 02:57:36.715]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[02:57:36.573 --> 02:57:37.734]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[02:57:37.754 --> 02:57:38.855]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[02:57:38.895 --> 02:57:40.276]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to?
[02:57:40.296 --> 02:57:41.017]  And Joe Rogan?
[02:57:41.277 --> 02:57:41.757]  Elon Musk?
[02:57:42.058 --> 02:57:42.998]  You know where they tune in, right?
[02:57:43.259 --> 02:57:43.919]  They tune in right here!
[02:57:44.900 --> 02:57:45.621]  InfoWars.
[02:57:46.001 --> 02:57:46.882]  Tomorrow's News.
[02:57:47.182 --> 02:57:47.642]  Today.
[02:57:48.283 --> 02:57:53.627]  We are witnessing the Mark of the Beast system openly rolled out and announced.
[02:57:54.107 --> 02:58:04.556]   Whether you believe the Bible is inspired by God or the Word of God or not, what was written over 2,000 years ago by John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos is coming true.
[02:58:04.716 --> 02:58:11.624]  A world government that makes you take a mark in the hand or the head to be able to buy and sell and that you must worship the beast.
[02:58:11.684 --> 02:58:15.288]  That means follow what the beast says or you can't buy or sell.
[02:58:15.448 --> 02:58:17.510]  It's not just that you have to have the mark to buy or sell.
[02:58:18.411 --> 02:58:24.636]  You've got to do what the beast wants you to do, or you cannot buy and sell.
[02:58:24.776 --> 02:58:27.759]  And that's where, in late 2022, we are.
[02:58:27.959 --> 02:58:38.147]  Last week, the World Economic Forum was given over $100 million by Government of Canada to roll out a World ID through the UN based on the Communist Chinese digital social credit score system.
[02:58:38.287 --> 02:58:40.830]  And now, just today, Bill Gates came out.
[02:58:41.130 --> 02:58:41.991]  Here's the article right here.
[02:58:42.631 --> 02:58:51.397]  And his foundation donated $200 million to expand digital ID surveillance system for the same Chinese communist control program.
[02:58:51.477 --> 02:59:03.044]  So the social credit score, communist China, and all the control you see is the model of this system being rolled out in Spain, rolled out in Italy, rolled out in Germany, rolled out in Canada, and now they're trying to roll it out here in America.
[02:59:03.124 --> 02:59:11.150]  Just a few years ago, Klaus Schwab, head of the WEF, said, you will have to take a microchip to buy and sell in the near future.
[02:59:11.750 --> 02:59:12.650]  And now here we are.
[02:59:13.330 --> 02:59:34.857]  So this is a huge, huge issue that they can then dictate to you through this new digital currency, through this World ID, every action you take in your life, with a carbon tax, through the social credit score, through universal basic income, as they shut off the regular economy and small businesses, making you sign on for a government handout.
[02:59:35.277 --> 02:59:39.358]  But with that handout comes all of the rules of the game.
[02:59:40.626 --> 02:59:44.851]  This is no longer theoretical on some drawing board or some computer.
[02:59:45.491 --> 02:59:51.058]  This is something the bureaucrats and the megacorporations and major governments are doing.
[02:59:51.098 --> 02:59:58.065]  There's a race between the West and Communist China to see, with big tech, who can put this in first.
[02:59:59.508 --> 03:00:02.570]  It's scary, but at least we are exposing it.
[03:00:02.890 --> 03:00:03.811]  And at least we know about it.
[03:00:04.091 --> 03:00:19.000]  Just last week, PayPal said, if you criticize government, if you criticize open borders, or forced injections, or anything else, gun control, we're going to fine you $2,500 for what we say you're doing in your own personal life.
[03:00:19.020 --> 03:00:21.602]  We're going to surveil you, and then we're going to censor you.
[03:00:22.381 --> 03:00:26.545]  But within days of the announcement, they had to back off because of the backlash.
[03:00:27.385 --> 03:00:29.427]  So submitting to this only makes things worse.
[03:00:29.887 --> 03:00:32.890]  Standing up to it and saying no only makes things better.
[03:00:33.490 --> 03:00:45.200]  And that's why it's so important today, ladies and gentlemen, to say no to World War, no to nuclear war, no to open borders, no to pedophilia, no to the Satanism that is the New World Order.
[03:00:45.280 --> 03:00:46.822]  And you cannot do that better.
[03:00:47.998 --> 03:00:51.820]  Than sharing the articles and videos and links from InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[03:00:52.060 --> 03:00:53.461]  To be the Paul Reveres of your era.

[03:01:14.974 --> 03:01:20.217]  We've got a Save InfoWars 1776 Mega Sale running for the next week.
[03:01:20.297 --> 03:01:25.020]  The biggest sales up to 60% off in the history of InfoWars at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:01:24.939 --> 03:01:28.939]   Thank you so much and join us during this important part of history.
[03:01:28.939 --> 03:01:38.698]   You got us the amazing sponsor a few years ago that have been great.
[03:01:38.788 --> 03:01:43.133]  The problem was everybody sold out of high quality but the same time affordable sat phones.
[03:01:43.173 --> 03:01:44.614]  They finally got them back in.
[03:01:44.694 --> 03:01:49.559]  They also have this amazing bivy stick dongle that turns any phone into a sat phone.
[03:01:49.719 --> 03:01:52.422]  Spend a few minutes telling folks about InfoWarsPhone.com.
[03:01:52.602 --> 03:02:02.725]  Well, first of all, anybody who's watched what happened in Florida absolutely saw people without power, people without communication, and the word when you lose communication is you panic.
[03:02:03.125 --> 03:02:34.514]   The nice thing about Satellite Phone Store is the owners have dedicated themselves to making sure everyone can stay in touch with their loved ones, that they understand How fragile the electrical grid is and also the cell phone communication grid I'm told that there are hundreds of thousands of people without cell phones in Florida and what was neat about satellite phone store Alex They sent out vans and we're finding people that had to communicate to let their loved ones know that they're alive Communication in a survival situation is paramount
[03:02:34.754 --> 03:02:39.377]  Not just to be keeping in contact with your loved ones, but for information services.
[03:02:39.457 --> 03:02:43.120]  So the bivy stick, obviously, is satellite to satellite.
[03:02:43.520 --> 03:02:49.004]  You use your cell phone in airplane mode, but this is probably one of the neatest things there is.
[03:02:49.124 --> 03:02:55.088]  The difference between the bivy stick and satellite phone is a voice communication, but you're limited to the amount of text you can send.
[03:02:55.128 --> 03:02:59.552]  With a bivy stick, you can give messaging, and that's one of the things that's so important.
[03:02:59.812 --> 03:03:01.613]  And these are free, just with a year contract.
[03:03:01.893 --> 03:03:04.836]  They have the satellite phones back in stock.
[03:03:05.196 --> 03:03:05.897]  You mentioned that.
[03:03:05.957 --> 03:03:08.419]  A thousand of them, I believe, available at the end of October.
[03:03:08.459 --> 03:03:09.600]  They've got the bivy stick.
[03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:11.621]  The package comes with a free phone.
[03:03:11.701 --> 03:03:13.423]  They have a satellite uplinks.
[03:03:13.483 --> 03:03:16.786]  They have the storage battery, the power solar generators.
[03:03:16.886 --> 03:03:22.090]  In essence, they are a one-stop communication and electrical production facility.
[03:03:22.210 --> 03:03:24.051]  Go to InfoWarsPhone.com or 941-955-1020.
[03:03:24.071 --> 03:03:24.111]  941-955-1020.
[03:03:24.131 --> 03:03:25.072]  That's InfoWarsPhone.com or 941-955-1020.
[03:03:25.112 --> 03:03:26.273]  This is essential.
[03:03:26.413 --> 03:03:27.173]  Everybody needs this.
