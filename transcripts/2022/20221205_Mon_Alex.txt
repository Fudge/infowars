[00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:20.046]  By opening the floodgates to unfettered free speech, Elon Musk has allowed hate to spread far and fast on Twitter.
[00:00:20.046 --> 00:00:39.457]  While the left winds out another distraction about Matt Taibbi catering to the richest man in the world, what do the Twitter files reveal about the inner workings of, as Taibbi described, a Frankensteinian tale of a human-built mechanism grown out of the control of its designer?
[00:00:39.737 --> 00:00:45.921]  By 2020, requests from the New World Order disciples to delete tweets were routine.
[00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:50.183]  One executive would write to another, more to review from the Biden team.
[00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.465]  The reply would come back, handled.
[00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:59.869]  Twitter was acting as a wrecking ball of political tech censorship, catering to the corrupt Washington establishment.
[00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:13.353]  Directly impacting and propagandizing a digital town square, which affected the general welfare of the United States, whose lifeblood is protected by the power and freedom of the First Amendment.
[00:01:13.353 --> 00:01:26.256]  And if it turns out there are a lot of us on this list, where the DNC targeted us, and I will quote the immortal words of Joseph Welch when he attacked Bill McCarthy for the enemies list he had,
[00:01:27.114 --> 00:01:31.237]  At long laughter, have you no shame?
[00:01:31.237 --> 00:01:31.477]  Yes.
[00:01:31.477 --> 00:01:48.089]  President Biden, all of your stocky little operatives in the DNC who have targeted American citizens, have you, Mr. President, have all of you at last no shame?
[00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:52.632]  Taibbi points out that both parties had access to these tools.
[00:01:53.012 --> 00:02:01.560]  For instance, in 2020, requests from both the Trump White House and the Biden campaign were received and honored.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:15.514]  But the overwhelming amount of leftist Marxist cucks staffed at Twitter ensured that Democrat Party requests took the front burner, a fact backed up by the overall donations by Twitter to the Democrat Party reaching
[00:02:15.774 --> 00:02:18.556]  99.73% or $165,969 to Democrats while $451 went to Republicans in 2022.
[00:02:18.556 --> 00:02:20.138]  Are you worried about these Twitter files coming out?
[00:02:20.138 --> 00:02:21.138]  What was that experience like having
[00:02:33.248 --> 00:02:38.433]  Kellyanne, who's always in control of herself, siccing this MAGA trolls on you.
[00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:39.394]  It's terrifying.
[00:02:39.394 --> 00:02:49.123]  When you get targeted in some of these ways, it's hard to differentiate between what is somebody just online trying to rattle you and what's a real threat.
[00:02:49.463 --> 00:02:58.107]  You see in things like Pizzagate that online conspiracies can mobilize very real and very direct offline violence.
[00:02:58.107 --> 00:02:59.308]  I saw those harms.
[00:02:59.308 --> 00:03:00.929]  I experienced those harms.
[00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:08.873]  And now it was those harms through a mainstream news outlet being held up in the Oval Office by the former President of the United States.
[00:03:08.873 --> 00:03:11.114]  And that is deeply terrifying.
[00:03:11.354 --> 00:03:26.724]  What does appear to be illegal to the point of treason is that a false narrative of possible foreign hacks supposedly behind the Biden laptop debacle was manufactured by Silicon Valley, the media, and the DNC.
[00:03:26.724 --> 00:03:32.347]  Well, we know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin.
[00:03:32.347 --> 00:03:38.591]  That's been clear for well over a year now that they've been pushing this false narrative about the Vice President and his son.
[00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:44.912]  According to internal emails, there was zero evidence of foreign interference occurring.
[00:03:44.912 --> 00:04:03.435]  What did occur was a meltdown of internal Twitter censorship spearheaded by top Twitter management, with the result of ultimately burying a critical story under false pretenses in order to sway popular opinion and alter the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.
[00:04:03.435 --> 00:04:06.976]  In retrospect, we now know that as the New York Post reported
[00:04:07.216 --> 00:04:18.584]  Nearly four of five Americans who've been following the Hunter Biden laptop scandal believe that truthful coverage would have changed the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.
[00:04:18.584 --> 00:04:21.846]  And an even higher number, 81 percent, said U.S.
[00:04:21.846 --> 00:04:25.269]  Attorney General Merrick Garland should investigate the laptop.
[00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:37.756]  Not only have Twitter employees like head of legal policy and trust Vijaya Gadi and trust in safety chief Yoel Roth proven that they willingly altered the 2020 U.S.
[00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:51.743]  presidential election, but they have demonstrated that Silicon Valley, the Mockingbird media, and the corruption in Washington is an occupying force and a direct threat to the stability and the future of the United States of America.
[00:04:52.043 --> 00:04:54.705]  This cyber insurrection is what I'm calling it.
[00:04:54.705 --> 00:05:00.789]  It's an assault on this country and it's borderline treason if you think about what the executives did.
[00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:10.454]  Christmas 2022 is almost here and we have great products at InfoWarsTore.com that empower your body, your libido, your immune system, that just enrich your life.

[00:05:42.185 --> 00:05:42.566]  Thank you.
[00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.812]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:06:07.812 --> 00:06:08.192]  We think.
[00:06:08.192 --> 00:06:08.792]  Just let me think.
[00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:14.315]  I suspect, even now, orders are being sheltered to telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:06:14.315 --> 00:06:16.056]  It's Chancellor Sutcliffe.
[00:06:16.056 --> 00:06:16.376]  Damn it!
[00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.477]  Why?
[00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:24.060]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.723]  Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation.
[00:06:29.083 --> 00:06:34.847]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:06:34.847 --> 00:06:35.868]  You designed it, sir.
[00:06:35.868 --> 00:06:36.808]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:06:36.808 --> 00:06:38.469]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:40.010]  Cruelty and injustice.
[00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.372]  Intolerance and oppression.
[00:06:42.372 --> 00:06:52.058]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and subverting your submission.
[00:06:52.058 --> 00:06:52.239]  Cameras.
[00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:53.219]  We need cameras.
[00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:54.440]  How did this happen?
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.461]  Who's to blame?
[00:06:56.362 --> 00:06:59.086]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:01.430]  They will be held accountable.
[00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.859]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:07:08.072 --> 00:07:10.033]  I know why you did it.
[00:07:10.033 --> 00:07:11.554]  I know you were afraid.
[00:07:11.554 --> 00:07:13.316]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:07:13.316 --> 00:07:13.536]  War?
[00:07:13.536 --> 00:07:14.176]  Terror?
[00:07:14.176 --> 00:07:15.477]  Disease?
[00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:21.921]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:28.185]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:07:28.185 --> 00:07:34.529]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:07:41.192 --> 00:07:42.872]  There is a war.
[00:07:42.872 --> 00:07:44.753]  It's happening now.
[00:07:44.753 --> 00:07:47.114]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:07:47.114 --> 00:07:49.534]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:07:49.534 --> 00:07:51.595]  We are the resistance.
[00:07:51.595 --> 00:08:00.178]  We are the Infowar.
[00:08:00.178 --> 00:08:08.460]  President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do that he's mean as a wolverine.
[00:08:18.042 --> 00:08:23.047]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth until dawn.
[00:08:23.047 --> 00:08:27.071]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:29.133]  The chair is against the wall.
[00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:31.335]  The chair is against the wall.
[00:08:31.335 --> 00:08:33.336]  John has a long mustache.
[00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:35.398]  John has a long mustache.
[00:08:35.398 --> 00:08:38.101]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:42.385]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[00:08:48.248 --> 00:08:50.130]  But they took a lot of people away.
[00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.252]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[00:08:52.252 --> 00:08:55.474]  People that had guns and things they wanted, they just took them away.
[00:08:55.474 --> 00:08:56.835]  Where?
[00:08:56.835 --> 00:08:59.077]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[00:08:59.077 --> 00:09:07.184]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:09:07.184 --> 00:09:11.048]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[00:09:18.385 --> 00:09:21.770]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.796]  Now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[00:09:30.819 --> 00:09:32.659]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:09:32.659 --> 00:09:33.680]  would you see that happening?
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:39.822]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[00:09:48.243 --> 00:09:54.267]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[00:09:54.267 --> 00:10:05.674]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[00:10:05.674 --> 00:10:08.156]  It's what we're doing here and let's not kid about it.
[00:10:08.156 --> 00:10:12.158]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[00:10:12.158 --> 00:10:14.220]  Seriously, put your gun down, really?
[00:10:16.409 --> 00:10:21.431]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:10:21.431 --> 00:10:23.232]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:10:23.232 --> 00:10:27.934]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[00:10:27.934 --> 00:10:32.936]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[00:10:32.936 --> 00:10:36.237]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[00:10:36.237 --> 00:10:40.119]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:10:54.233 --> 00:11:02.239]  President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do, that he's mean as a wolverine.
[00:11:02.239 --> 00:11:15.990]  Wolverines!
[00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.791]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:23.733]  It's Monday, December 5th, 2022.
[00:11:23.733 --> 00:11:27.074]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:11:27.074 --> 00:11:32.996]  And something happened last night, yesterday, that's gotten really no attention.
[00:11:32.996 --> 00:11:35.678]  That's a big deal.
[00:11:35.678 --> 00:11:45.842]  Missiles hit and damaged Russian nuclear bombers deep inside Russia.
[00:11:45.842 --> 00:11:48.363]  That's how wars escalate into thermal nuclear war.
[00:11:50.506 --> 00:11:51.506]  The Moscow Times.
[00:11:51.506 --> 00:11:53.187]  Three killed.
[00:11:53.187 --> 00:11:57.329]  Nuclear-capable bombers, likely damaged in a Russian airfield.
[00:11:57.329 --> 00:11:57.910]  Explosion.
[00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.011]  There's video.
[00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:04.413]  Coming up, we'll get to next segment.
[00:12:04.413 --> 00:12:08.095]  Where you see a missile straight through the air.
[00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:09.935]  Missiles.
[00:12:09.935 --> 00:12:17.039]  And then the target is struck.
[00:12:17.039 --> 00:12:19.260]  This is getting completely out of control very, very quickly.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:28.004]  We're going to be looking at that in detail, obviously, here today, coming up next segment.
[00:12:28.004 --> 00:12:34.527]  The Twitter files, the first tranche of which Musk released over the weekend, or on Friday, are just devastating.
[00:12:34.527 --> 00:12:36.528]  It's exactly what I told you.
[00:12:36.528 --> 00:12:41.511]  Government interfacing with think tanks and big tech and dinosaur media.
[00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:49.715]  Surveilling people online and censoring people at the direction of the FBI and the Justice Department and the ADL.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.603]  This is a trillion times bigger than anything Richard Nixon did.
[00:12:56.603 --> 00:12:57.044]  Literally.
[00:12:57.044 --> 00:13:02.647]  I mean, it's just, Nixon had a safe with a hundred and something names in it he was thinking about using the IRS on.
[00:13:02.647 --> 00:13:09.171]  So we've seen Loris Lerner under Obama persecute hundreds of thousands of conservatives and we've seen no one get in trouble.
[00:13:09.171 --> 00:13:15.295]  And so now it's just escalated, escalated, escalated by the deep state when Trump was in office going after him, going after the American people.
[00:13:16.152 --> 00:13:22.235]  Now we begin to learn what I told you years ago, the full extent of it, because it was all in the government spending documents.
[00:13:22.235 --> 00:13:31.379]  It was in Obama's challenging Foreign Disinformation and Propaganda Act when he left office in 2017.
[00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:39.903]  He signed those executive orders and Trump never reversed them because he'd never been in government.
[00:13:40.678 --> 00:13:45.341]  I told Trump about it on the phone, and that's when my life became a living hell.
[00:13:45.341 --> 00:13:52.245]  And they admitted, they said, our main mission headline is to keep Trump away from Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[00:13:52.245 --> 00:13:58.749]  They said General Kelly's quote, main job, CNN headline, is keeping Trump away from InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[00:13:58.749 --> 00:14:05.413]  I'm like, sir, here's the group, here's the names, Fiona Hill, they're running a Soros mole operation.
[00:14:05.413 --> 00:14:07.595]  Because I'm just a loyal American that cares about my country.
[00:14:08.942 --> 00:14:15.586]  And you've seen the aftermath of that because they never thought a citizen would actually study government and how this is going on.
[00:14:15.586 --> 00:14:17.447]  So I'm not here to get the credit.
[00:14:17.447 --> 00:14:19.468]  I'm not here to say, oh, look, we did it first.
[00:14:19.468 --> 00:14:21.549]  But remember all the CNN headlines?
[00:14:21.549 --> 00:14:24.331]  Alex Jones is insane.
[00:14:24.331 --> 00:14:29.314]  He claims the government's spying on Trump and claims that government's working with big tech to censor.
[00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.430]  And now where are we?
[00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:35.011]  You're living it.
[00:14:35.011 --> 00:14:35.851]  It's out in the open.
[00:14:35.851 --> 00:14:38.132]  It's not just going after Alex Jones or Trump now.
[00:14:38.132 --> 00:14:41.072]  It's going after you.
[00:14:41.072 --> 00:14:43.633]  So we've got that huge news.
[00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:45.614]  We've got massive news out of Brazil.
[00:14:45.614 --> 00:14:53.256]  Brazilian military kills Red Command leaders and has been making announcements through different channels that they are strongly considering.
[00:14:57.256 --> 00:14:59.637]  Removing the Lula government because of evidence of fraud.
[00:14:59.637 --> 00:15:01.598]  It's in the Constitution, they can do that.
[00:15:01.598 --> 00:15:04.319]  When branches of government are deadlocked.
[00:15:04.319 --> 00:15:06.840]  You have the executive and the judiciary deadlocked.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.902]  The judiciary are the communists, they control the elections.
[00:15:10.902 --> 00:15:15.384]  And you've seen, you've seen what's happening.
[00:15:15.384 --> 00:15:18.565]  So, we're going to be laying all that out today and so much more.
[00:15:19.995 --> 00:15:27.139]  Obviously, there's a lot of de-industrialization, post-industrial world news that is just off the charts.
[00:15:27.139 --> 00:15:28.439]  Incredible.
[00:15:28.439 --> 00:15:33.962]  It's not Alex Jones telling you an Obama deception.
[00:15:33.962 --> 00:15:43.407]  In 2004, they're going to shut down the farms and take your gasoline cars away and have carbon lockdowns.
[00:15:43.407 --> 00:15:45.368]  It's now been announced.
[00:15:45.368 --> 00:15:46.529]  Got a big stack on that as well.
[00:15:47.637 --> 00:15:49.620]  We want to know what they are doing and how to stop them.
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.741]  We know how to do it.
[00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:52.023]  We know what we're doing.
[00:15:52.023 --> 00:15:52.704]  Please stay with us.
[00:15:52.704 --> 00:15:57.331]  If you want to be free and defeat the globalists, share the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:16:00.458 --> 00:16:09.302]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:13.124]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[00:16:13.124 --> 00:16:22.208]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company and they're able to cut our regular shipping costs by up to 50%.
[00:16:22.208 --> 00:16:24.229]  So that means even on orders that are below $50,
[00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:28.452]  You're going to be paying way lower than you were previously.
[00:16:28.452 --> 00:16:29.913]  This is a game changer.
[00:16:29.913 --> 00:16:31.454]  We're so excited about it.
[00:16:31.454 --> 00:16:33.696]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[00:16:33.696 --> 00:16:38.140]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.242]  So now, your orders will be shipped even faster.
[00:16:41.242 --> 00:16:43.704]  The same great customer service and more.
[00:16:43.704 --> 00:16:49.469]  So, get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at infowarestore.com right now.
[00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:57.953]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system, lead a healthier life, and keep Inflores on the air at InfloresTour.com.
[00:17:00.737 --> 00:17:07.719]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[00:17:07.719 --> 00:17:12.901]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[00:17:12.901 --> 00:17:19.943]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[00:17:19.943 --> 00:17:23.104]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.
[00:17:24.004 --> 00:17:28.147]  And you can do that now at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:34.610]  Help us clear out our stock of bodies' turmeric, vitamin C with zinc, and alpha power.
[00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:42.034]  Turn those shady Federal Reserve notes into the highest quality supplements available, while they still last.
[00:17:42.034 --> 00:17:45.236]  Now, with free shipping.
[00:17:45.236 --> 00:17:47.558]  We thank you for your support.
[00:17:47.558 --> 00:17:51.520]  And we wish you a very peaceful, happy, and Merry Christmas.
[00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:11.356]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:13.237]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[00:18:13.237 --> 00:18:14.698]  That's what they want to take away.
[00:18:14.698 --> 00:18:16.199]  Your ability to speak freely.
[00:18:16.199 --> 00:18:17.920]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.201]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[00:18:19.201 --> 00:18:20.602]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[00:18:21.022 --> 00:18:25.865]  I studied the Globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[00:18:25.865 --> 00:18:28.247]  And I warned the public, as a modern Paul Revere.
[00:18:28.247 --> 00:18:30.268]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[00:18:30.268 --> 00:18:37.213]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the Globalist agenda.
[00:18:37.853 --> 00:18:43.236]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[00:18:43.236 --> 00:18:52.200]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:58.463]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[00:18:59.818 --> 00:19:03.179]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[00:19:03.179 --> 00:19:05.980]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.641]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[00:19:08.641 --> 00:19:10.002]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[00:19:10.002 --> 00:19:13.903]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:18.805]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[00:19:19.105 --> 00:19:25.268]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[00:19:25.268 --> 00:19:33.911]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[00:19:33.911 --> 00:19:39.594]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[00:19:39.594 --> 00:19:45.016]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[00:19:45.256 --> 00:19:47.738]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[00:19:47.738 --> 00:19:50.440]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.921]  So go check out the store.
[00:19:51.921 --> 00:19:53.102]  Go support their store.
[00:19:53.102 --> 00:19:54.343]  Go support InfoWars.
[00:19:54.343 --> 00:19:55.985]  Leave a donation right now.
[00:19:55.985 --> 00:20:00.908]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:05.512]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:05.512 --> 00:20:06.813]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:28.306 --> 00:20:31.567]  It is December 5th.
[00:20:31.567 --> 00:20:36.069]  Thank you for joining us on this Monday broadcast.
[00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:44.072]  We are definitely covering the topics that the establishment does not want you to know about and does not want you to even think about.
[00:20:44.072 --> 00:20:53.435]  Because if we expose their operations, the population of this planet, not just America, is going to know that it's the globalists behind it and they're going to be stopped.
[00:20:55.570 --> 00:21:01.415]  The public continues to be geopolitically and politically and culturally ignorant.
[00:21:01.415 --> 00:21:08.061]  We're going to be like a blind man walking off the edge of a cliff here.
[00:21:08.061 --> 00:21:13.746]  And there's not much time to turn this around.
[00:21:13.746 --> 00:21:18.471]  Now even the London Guardian and the Russian news and the German news, they're all reporting that it's obviously
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:32.566]  Kiev, Ukraine, has launched these attacks that have caused explosions at two Russian military bases close to each other, two airbases.
[00:21:32.566 --> 00:21:37.189]  The explosions rocked two Russian airbases far from Ukraine's front line.
[00:21:37.189 --> 00:21:47.374]  Explosions have rocked two Russian airbases far from the front lines of Kiev, as Kiev appeared to launch a preemptive strike on bombers that the Kremlin has used to try to cripple the Ukrainian electrical grid.
[00:21:48.007 --> 00:21:58.313]  The attack on Monday is confirmed would be an unexpected operation deep inside Russia meant to disrupt the Kremlin strategy provoking a humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine on the verge of winter.
[00:21:58.313 --> 00:22:02.175]  That's Leningradian.
[00:22:02.175 --> 00:22:08.039]  Explosion at nuclear air bases 150 miles from Moscow opened stunning new phase of war.
[00:22:08.039 --> 00:22:10.080]  German news.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.762]  Three killed nuclear cable bombers likely damaged in Russian airfield explosions.
[00:22:17.688 --> 00:22:19.330]  We call that escalation next level.
[00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:22.074]  But before I go any further, I've got to do this or we're not going to be here.
[00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:27.461]  And I just want to be very, very straight with the listeners, as I always am, and very, very clear.
[00:22:27.461 --> 00:22:33.770]  All the corporate news and all the media you hear about me having hundreds of millions of dollars is a complete and total lie.
[00:22:35.382 --> 00:22:45.134]  I do not have more than $200,000 in my personal bank account, which is almost nothing when you have the expenses and bills I do.
[00:22:45.134 --> 00:22:49.459]  I basically run out of money to even pay my private legal bills, and that's okay.
[00:22:49.459 --> 00:22:50.180]  I trust in God.
[00:22:51.363 --> 00:23:00.511]  And I've declared personal bankruptcy because I don't have any money and they're lying about that in the news and saying I'm a criminal hiding all these assets and the rest of it.
[00:23:00.511 --> 00:23:05.496]  So when you support us and you buy products at InfoWarshore.com, you keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:23:06.468 --> 00:23:26.460]  So we can appeal these false fraudulent criminal verdicts for several years and we're going to win, every expert agrees, just because they got two state judges that in my view are criminals, to do this fraud and tell juries I'm guilty and say $1.5 billion and all the rest of this, doesn't mean that the appellate courts are going to go along with it.
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.282]  They can't.
[00:23:28.282 --> 00:23:29.803]  Or it sets a very dangerous precedent.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:37.044]  And so the money you buy products for at InfoWareStore.com does not go to these people.
[00:23:37.044 --> 00:23:39.306]  They're acting like this operation already belongs to them.
[00:23:39.306 --> 00:23:42.408]  They're acting like they get the money that comes from this operation.
[00:23:42.408 --> 00:23:43.469]  That's not the case.
[00:23:43.469 --> 00:23:50.334]  We're in Chapter 11, Subchapter 5 with free speech systems because it had been pushed to the wall and didn't have the funds.
[00:23:50.334 --> 00:23:54.817]  We went in emergency reorganization to keep the operation going indefinitely.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:00.104]  Okay, and it's going well, despite what the corporate media says, because we've been honest.
[00:24:00.104 --> 00:24:01.105]  It's all out there in the open.
[00:24:01.105 --> 00:24:08.331]  So that keeps the crew employed in this important operation here, because you're buying products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:18.340]  I have foregone over the last year being paid, but I'm going to have to go ahead and demand to be paid now by free speech in the bankruptcy, because I can't
[00:24:19.451 --> 00:24:20.892]  Pay my personal bills.
[00:24:20.892 --> 00:24:21.613]  So that's going on.
[00:24:21.613 --> 00:24:28.839]  So when you buy products at InfoWarsTore.com, you're supporting InfoWars and the operation and keeping me operating.
[00:24:28.839 --> 00:24:33.243]  Separately, the personal bankruptcy in the next few weeks will be filed.
[00:24:33.243 --> 00:24:34.123]  It will be public.
[00:24:34.123 --> 00:24:35.545]  I mean, it's already filed.
[00:24:35.545 --> 00:24:38.227]  And my assets will then be put on display.
[00:24:38.227 --> 00:24:45.353]  And you're going to see a Hellcat Dodge car and a couple watches and nothing else.
[00:24:45.353 --> 00:24:46.254]  My furniture's cheap.
[00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:50.253]  The few televisions I have are like $2,000.
[00:24:50.253 --> 00:24:51.994]  I don't have all this stuff, they say.
[00:24:51.994 --> 00:24:56.317]  Almost everything you see in the news is a total lie, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:56.317 --> 00:24:58.359]  They put on the news, here's his house.
[00:24:58.359 --> 00:25:01.622]  It's not even my house.
[00:25:01.622 --> 00:25:04.924]  You know they lie, but it's next level.
[00:25:04.924 --> 00:25:11.069]  Like when Twitter allowed people to say that James Woods seaguiled, and he didn't seaguile, he just made it up.
[00:25:11.069 --> 00:25:11.870]  He's now suing them.
[00:25:13.427 --> 00:25:18.232]  So they just make up whatever they want, and the level of lies even shocks me.
[00:25:18.232 --> 00:25:20.774]  So, it's very simple.
[00:25:20.774 --> 00:25:24.357]  I am in your hands, this operation is in your hands, plus we have great products you need.
[00:25:24.357 --> 00:25:30.203]  If you don't go to m4warstore.com and do your Christmas shopping at m4warstore, we are not going to be here.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.222]  Because we have to pay a lot of the money that comes in to buy future products to come in.
[00:25:35.222 --> 00:25:37.063]  More isn't coming in for two or three months.
[00:25:37.063 --> 00:25:38.283]  You notice we're out of t-shirts.
[00:25:38.283 --> 00:25:39.984]  You notice we're out of a lot of items.
[00:25:39.984 --> 00:25:41.265]  I told you this.
[00:25:41.265 --> 00:25:46.227]  Everything we're selling on the site, we have in stock, ready to ship to you quickly.
[00:25:46.227 --> 00:25:50.269]  But we are in the most precarious financial position we've ever been.
[00:25:51.315 --> 00:25:52.336]  And it's very simple.
[00:25:52.336 --> 00:25:53.577]  We're in your hands.
[00:25:53.577 --> 00:25:55.498]  I need you to go to infowarestore.com.
[00:25:55.498 --> 00:25:57.659]  We're selling out of DNA Force Plus.
[00:25:57.659 --> 00:25:59.641]  We're selling out of VasoBeats.
[00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:01.622]  We're selling out of Ultra 12.
[00:26:01.622 --> 00:26:07.646]  We're selling out of the 1100% of daily allowance Vitamin C with the Zinc Linus Pauling Formula.
[00:26:07.646 --> 00:26:09.608]  It's so incredible for your whole body immune system.
[00:26:09.608 --> 00:26:11.289]  We're selling out of the D3 Gummies.
[00:26:11.289 --> 00:26:12.530]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.231]  The strongest turmeric you're going to find anywhere.
[00:26:15.325 --> 00:26:27.918]  And this will all sell out at current sales rates in about a month or sooner, and then I'm going to have to, until the new products come in in a couple months, basically just sit here and ask for money, or we're going to go off the air.
[00:26:27.918 --> 00:26:29.660]  And then I know the money will flood in.
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:34.505]  Oh, sorry, we're closing by, but it's very hard to restart something like this up anew.
[00:26:35.757 --> 00:26:37.198]  So, this is serious.
[00:26:37.198 --> 00:26:40.038]  We've been in a major fight with the globalists, toe-to-toe.
[00:26:40.038 --> 00:26:45.040]  You see the huge results we have, the billions of people we've reached, the tens of millions of Americans.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.761]  We are the recognized tip of the spear in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:26:48.761 --> 00:26:56.384]  So get Brain Force Ultra, the incredible, clean, amazing nootropic that hits in 15 minutes, only lasts like 3 hours.
[00:26:56.384 --> 00:27:00.365]  I love it because you can take it, you know, you've got to go to a dinner party, you're tired, it's 8 o'clock at night.
[00:27:00.365 --> 00:27:01.846]  Take it, get back from dinner party, go to bed at 11.
[00:27:03.522 --> 00:27:04.804]  It's at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:27:04.804 --> 00:27:06.106]  Incredible nootropics.
[00:27:06.106 --> 00:27:07.027]  So good for your brain.
[00:27:07.027 --> 00:27:09.210]  A healthy stimulant combo.
[00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.852]  A whole bunch of ingredients.
[00:27:10.852 --> 00:27:16.620]  Brain Force Plus is a good, strong, clean, natural way to have about six, seven hours of energy.
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.463]  You notice I haven't had turbo force in six months.
[00:27:20.445 --> 00:27:25.488]  We're trying to get that remanufactured, but some of the ingredients are so high quality, we haven't been able to get them.
[00:27:25.488 --> 00:27:37.917]  So, whether it's Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, DNA Force Plus, Vitamineral Fusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, they're all there at InfoWarsTore.com, and they're amazing, and they make your life better and healthier.
[00:27:37.917 --> 00:27:39.959]  I told you we're selling out of X2, X3, it's gone.
[00:27:39.959 --> 00:27:42.361]  I told you we're selling out of Wake of America Coffee, it's gone.
[00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:44.702]  I told you we're selling out of Biotricillinium, it's gone.
[00:27:44.702 --> 00:27:46.484]  This is not a game.
[00:27:46.484 --> 00:27:47.845]  So what we've got is what we've got.
[00:27:49.045 --> 00:27:54.130]  And it really is up to you, but this is like a sudden death NFL overtime game.
[00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:57.053]  I mean, this is right to the minute.
[00:27:57.053 --> 00:27:58.414]  This is a horse race.
[00:27:58.414 --> 00:28:00.856]  This is two and O's with the horses.
[00:28:00.856 --> 00:28:06.161]  And this is God just letting me know that it's God, because God has always come through in the past, working through you.
[00:28:06.161 --> 00:28:09.805]  But I need everybody to go to mfulworthsport.com and sign up for AutoShip.

[00:30:00.313 --> 00:30:11.780]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:16.242]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[00:30:16.242 --> 00:30:20.224]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[00:30:20.224 --> 00:30:24.647]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[00:30:24.647 --> 00:30:25.728]  You see, the sun
[00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:26.748]  We're good to
[00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:54.140]  At InfoWarStore.com with promo code 1776.
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:54.822]  Don't wait!
[00:30:54.822 --> 00:30:59.133]  Support the InfoWar and your immune system with vitamin D3 gummies at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:07.654]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[00:31:07.654 --> 00:31:12.857]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[00:31:12.857 --> 00:31:19.882]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[00:31:19.882 --> 00:31:23.064]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.
[00:31:23.924 --> 00:31:28.087]  And you can do that now at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:31:28.087 --> 00:31:31.730]  Help us clear out our stock of bodies tumored.
[00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:34.551]  Vitamin C with zinc and alpha power.
[00:31:34.551 --> 00:31:41.976]  Turn those shady Federal Reserve notes into the highest quality supplements available while they still last.
[00:31:41.976 --> 00:31:45.159]  Now with free shipping.
[00:31:45.159 --> 00:31:51.463]  We thank you for your support and we wish you a very peaceful, happy and Merry Christmas.
[00:32:00.026 --> 00:32:20.633]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[00:32:21.153 --> 00:32:34.277]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[00:32:34.277 --> 00:32:43.120]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:49.542]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[00:32:49.642 --> 00:32:51.063]  So continue to do it.
[00:32:51.063 --> 00:32:53.265]  Go to places like Infowarsstore.com.
[00:32:53.265 --> 00:32:55.367]  Go to the places like Save Infowars.
[00:32:55.367 --> 00:33:01.533]  Continue to keep Infowars alive, because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[00:33:01.533 --> 00:33:11.283]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:11.283 --> 00:33:12.203]  We've got it.
[00:33:18.408 --> 00:33:22.730]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:30.914]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:30.914 --> 00:33:47.803]  In December of 2016, it was tagged on to the 2017 Defense Authorization Act by Obama and passed by Congress to put more than three billion dollars
[00:33:49.935 --> 00:33:55.977]  into a government program countering Foreign Disinformation Propaganda Act.
[00:33:55.977 --> 00:34:01.178]  And it said the CIA will merge with the Justice Department in domestic operations.
[00:34:01.178 --> 00:34:04.579]  That's totally illegal, but they did it.
[00:34:04.579 --> 00:34:09.861]  And they will counter disinformation online.
[00:34:09.861 --> 00:34:14.842]  And those very groups then countered the President, countered the Republican Party, countered Infowars,
[00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:26.275]  And when people in the know, like Matt Drudge, were notified of this, and told you'll be destroyed or join us, he put a gun to his head, basically.
[00:34:26.275 --> 00:34:28.557]  You saw what Matt Drudge did.
[00:34:28.557 --> 00:34:31.379]  Now, they put the gun to my head, and I didn't roll over.
[00:34:31.379 --> 00:34:33.220]  And I'm not attacking Matt Drudge.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:39.945]  He got Trump into office, more than anybody else probably, and was a great guy, but he just couldn't handle it.
[00:34:39.945 --> 00:34:43.267]  And now, Drudge Report is run by CNN.
[00:34:45.086 --> 00:34:49.768]  A private consortium group came in and basically bought the site out.
[00:34:49.768 --> 00:34:52.589]  And the word is Matt Drudge still has a little bit of editorial control.
[00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:54.970]  I have that from inside sources.
[00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:58.892]  I didn't just say all that back at the time because I just pulled it out of the air.
[00:34:58.892 --> 00:35:03.314]  And now you see the Twitter data dump from Musk and it's right there.
[00:35:03.314 --> 00:35:05.075]  The FBI in weekly meetings
[00:35:08.755 --> 00:35:14.938]  Coordinating and in daily emails with huge list of who they wanted banned.
[00:35:14.938 --> 00:35:24.242]  And this is when Trump's in office and it was specifically targeting him and Infowars and James Woods, anybody else that they saw as truthful and effective.
[00:35:24.242 --> 00:35:24.662]  So listen.
[00:35:25.582 --> 00:35:26.263]  It's true.
[00:35:26.263 --> 00:35:33.787]  I've taken on the CIA and the FBI and the Justice Department because they're allowing human trafficking and smuggling and fentanyl.
[00:35:33.787 --> 00:35:35.928]  In fact, I saw a report I didn't get to yesterday.
[00:35:35.928 --> 00:35:38.089]  We guys reprinted it in San Francisco.
[00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:50.496]  A father let his 10-year-old crawl around on the ground at the park for just a second and the 10-month-old picked up a tiny piece of fentanyl or licked his hands and died.
[00:35:53.792 --> 00:36:04.736]  All over the country, in blue cities, the Democrats, I saw a report a few weeks ago where they, in San Francisco, released two Asian men, who weren't even U.S.
[00:36:04.736 --> 00:36:16.001]  citizens, from China, who had brought in two duffel bags of pure fentanyl, enough to kill more than 50,000 people.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.080]  Totally weaponized.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:29.982]  A hundred times stronger than heroin.
[00:36:29.982 --> 00:36:31.662]  Yeah, that's a study you guys pulled up.
[00:36:31.662 --> 00:36:36.663]  It was, uh, 10-month-old dies at San Francisco playground after accidental fentanyl overdose.
[00:36:36.663 --> 00:36:37.504]  That's the actual headline.
[00:36:37.504 --> 00:36:38.544]  There it is.
[00:36:38.544 --> 00:36:39.524]  ABC News 7.
[00:36:39.524 --> 00:36:40.624]  A shock!
[00:36:40.624 --> 00:36:44.465]  Parent speaks of her 10-month-old survives fentanyl overdose.
[00:36:44.465 --> 00:36:47.166]  The one I read said he died.
[00:36:47.166 --> 00:36:49.167]  Good, he didn't die.
[00:36:49.167 --> 00:36:50.227]  It all just blurs together.
[00:36:50.227 --> 00:36:50.887]  There's been so many.
[00:36:52.182 --> 00:37:00.764]  So, what I'm getting at here is, we are under total, complete bombardment.
[00:37:00.764 --> 00:37:19.029]  We have a weaponized Justice Department that's gotten away with bloody murder, and now it's coming out that they were spying on people and censoring people en masse, and meddling and involving major election interference, and the entire corporate media is totally ignoring it and or defending it.
[00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:30.783]  So they're just normalizing this.
[00:37:30.783 --> 00:37:34.952]  So, I don't feel ashamed that my company's bankrupt.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.923]  I don't feel ashamed that I'm bankrupt.
[00:37:39.923 --> 00:37:42.785]  I'm proud that I took on the New World Order.
[00:37:42.785 --> 00:37:45.948]  I'm proud I've been in the fight 28 years plus.
[00:37:45.948 --> 00:37:51.633]  I'm proud of the effect we've all had together against the globalists, that we've stood up to them.
[00:37:51.633 --> 00:37:58.599]  But now we're at the most important juncture in our work where we have the most credibility, we're having the biggest effect.
[00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:04.753]  And it's this weird paradox where people go, Oh, Alex Jones is right, or Alex Jones is right.
[00:38:04.753 --> 00:38:08.295]  And so now everything he said basically came true.
[00:38:08.295 --> 00:38:10.296]  And now basically everybody else is agreeing with me.
[00:38:10.296 --> 00:38:12.937]  And we're, we're having a huge effect against the enemy.
[00:38:12.937 --> 00:38:19.840]  But people have to understand that there's going to be the next set of globalist operations that I'm going to need to decipher and break down.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.922]  Because if I don't do the analysis, and I'm very upset about this, almost no one else will.
[00:38:26.155 --> 00:38:35.479]  Because people are good at listening to me, and going and researching it, and finding out it's true, and then you see and hear everything I break months after coming out in the mainstream.
[00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:37.760]  I don't want to be the guy that's able to figure this out.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.781]  I can't believe how easy it is to figure out, and other people can't do it.
[00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:45.163]  But I'm the best quarterback we've got in this fight, and I need to stay in the damn game.
[00:38:46.331 --> 00:38:48.333]  Believe me, I'm exhausted.
[00:38:48.333 --> 00:38:53.017]  At a lot of levels, I want to be able to fade away and not be part of this anymore.
[00:38:53.017 --> 00:38:55.018]  I've done this long enough, let me tell you.
[00:38:55.018 --> 00:38:59.382]  But I can't give up because these people are too evil and God's watching.
[00:38:59.382 --> 00:39:08.930]  And so I don't want the listeners to give up and to believe the enemy lies that, oh, he owes a billion and a half dollars, he'll be gone when that's all a lie.
[00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:11.833]  They want us gone now so we don't appeal and defeat them.
[00:39:13.479 --> 00:39:20.084]  So don't listen to their psyops, you see, that are put all over the newspapers across the country thinking you're weak-minded.
[00:39:20.084 --> 00:39:28.651]  And there's hundreds of different psyops they do, and every single one of them is either a total lie or 90% lies.
[00:39:28.651 --> 00:39:32.614]  And understanding propaganda against me is understanding propaganda against you.
[00:39:32.614 --> 00:39:34.155]  You see this headline everywhere.
[00:39:34.155 --> 00:39:39.660]  Alex Jones pays $100,000 a week to his personal trainer, but won't pay his wife child support.
[00:39:40.825 --> 00:39:41.586]  None of that's true.
[00:39:41.586 --> 00:39:42.426]  Ex-wife.
[00:39:42.426 --> 00:39:44.588]  None of that's true.
[00:39:44.588 --> 00:39:48.530]  You see a Secretary of State filing in Texas that hasn't paid child support?
[00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:50.592]  You get arrested in Texas for that.
[00:39:50.592 --> 00:39:51.732]  It's not true.
[00:39:51.732 --> 00:39:55.315]  But all over the country, Alex Jones is a deadbeat.
[00:39:55.315 --> 00:39:56.896]  Alex Jones doesn't pay child support.
[00:39:56.896 --> 00:39:57.677]  That's a lie. 100%.
[00:40:04.574 --> 00:40:05.295]  It's the same thing.
[00:40:05.295 --> 00:40:07.056]  I don't pay my personal trainer.
[00:40:07.056 --> 00:40:09.157]  He's not my personal trainer.
[00:40:09.157 --> 00:40:11.039]  He does have a degree in kinesiology.
[00:40:11.039 --> 00:40:12.380]  I have known him eight years.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.121]  He does own a bunch of businesses.
[00:40:14.121 --> 00:40:23.007]  I asked him to take over our shipping department in the interim and help move it to another private facility for lower prices, and he's no longer even in there.
[00:40:23.007 --> 00:40:30.713]  He helped transfer it in the last six months to another big national facility he has nothing to do with, and the guy has a kinesiology degree.
[00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:36.531]  And the guy put a gym in in our old warehouse for our crew to use.
[00:40:36.531 --> 00:40:40.493]  So when they asked him, when they called him into the bankruptcy court, they said, well, what's your background?
[00:40:40.493 --> 00:40:41.933]  We hear you're a personal trainer.
[00:40:41.933 --> 00:40:43.614]  And he said, well, yeah, I mean, I do that.
[00:40:43.614 --> 00:40:48.636]  And I did put a gym in at the office at Alex's request, and I've been contracting for him for years.
[00:40:48.636 --> 00:40:52.237]  But then you read the headline, Jones gives $100,000 a week as personal trainer.
[00:40:52.237 --> 00:40:56.299]  So listeners hear that and think, well, my God, he's got plenty of money.
[00:40:56.299 --> 00:40:59.480]  See the psyop they ran with these PR firms, they admit?
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.081]  This is CIA level disinformation, probably by them.
[00:41:04.091 --> 00:41:05.251]  How do we hurt him?
[00:41:05.251 --> 00:41:07.832]  Well, this guy's a kinesiologist.
[00:41:07.832 --> 00:41:08.693]  We won't say that.
[00:41:08.693 --> 00:41:10.573]  Say he's Alex Jones' personal trainer.
[00:41:10.573 --> 00:41:13.494]  And what do we do about $100,000 a week in shipping costs?
[00:41:13.494 --> 00:41:14.474]  How do we make that look bad?
[00:41:14.474 --> 00:41:16.895]  Well, just say he gives it to him.
[00:41:16.895 --> 00:41:19.296]  Alex Jones pays $100,000 for personal training.
[00:41:19.296 --> 00:41:21.077]  Who the hell believes that?
[00:41:21.077 --> 00:41:25.318]  I pay zero to Pat Riley for personal training.
[00:41:28.032 --> 00:41:31.415]  I asked Pat Riley to put a gym in for our crew to use.
[00:41:31.415 --> 00:41:37.040]  Hell, we even got an insurance discount doing it four years ago.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:43.706]  So right through those walls in this building is a gym for our crew.
[00:41:43.706 --> 00:41:47.470]  With exercise machines and ellipticals and it's just a basic gym.
[00:41:48.834 --> 00:41:53.177]  But again, you're like, well there's all this news and the Globals are now bombing Russia.
[00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:54.698]  Why are you telling this?
[00:41:54.698 --> 00:42:02.883]  Because it's just an example, a microcosm of the level of their deception and how whatever you see has nothing to do with reality.
[00:42:02.883 --> 00:42:11.007]  Like, that's 99% a lie that I give $100,000 a week to my personal trainer.
[00:42:11.007 --> 00:42:12.989]  Yeah, he's a personal trainer.
[00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:14.870]  Yeah, he's basically a chiropractor.
[00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:16.671]  Have I begged Pat sometimes?
[00:42:16.671 --> 00:42:17.932]  Hey, will you come by the office and
[00:42:19.738 --> 00:42:22.600]  Will you put my hip back in joint or whatever?
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:29.004]  I mean, I begged him a couple of weeks ago, will you please come to the office and crank my back and get this crick I've got out, because he does a great job.
[00:42:29.004 --> 00:42:31.065]  Better than chiropractors I've gone to, you name it.
[00:42:31.065 --> 00:42:39.931]  But the point is, that's how they turn into this whole sick thing that, oh, Jones got so much money, he's been a purse trader, the guy took over the shipping department and successfully now transferred it
[00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:45.654]  To Denver, Colorado, where our shipping is, so we can get better pricing for you, and now he's not involved in it.
[00:42:45.654 --> 00:42:51.498]  He did a job for me, and they got mad at him, so they attacked him in the national news and lied about him.
[00:42:51.498 --> 00:42:57.942]  Because they're criminal scum that hate you and your family, and they're, of their father, the devil, who are liars!
[00:43:00.322 --> 00:43:09.147]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:43:09.147 --> 00:43:12.969]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[00:43:12.969 --> 00:43:22.054]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company and they're able to cut our regular shipping costs by up to 50%.
[00:43:22.054 --> 00:43:24.075]  So that means even on orders that are below $50,
[00:43:24.855 --> 00:43:28.297]  You're going to be paying way lower than you were previously.
[00:43:28.297 --> 00:43:29.758]  This is a game changer.
[00:43:29.758 --> 00:43:31.279]  We're so excited about it.
[00:43:31.279 --> 00:43:33.540]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:37.983]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[00:43:37.983 --> 00:43:41.085]  So now, your orders will be shipped even faster.
[00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:43.546]  The same great customer service and more.
[00:43:43.546 --> 00:43:49.269]  So, get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:56.953]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system, lead a healthier life, and keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:43:56.953 --> 00:44:00.134]  InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:44:00.134 --> 00:44:06.137]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[00:44:06.137 --> 00:44:09.038]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[00:44:09.038 --> 00:44:10.319]  I'm going to do that right now.
[00:44:10.319 --> 00:44:14.221]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[00:44:14.221 --> 00:44:19.123]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:25.588]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[00:44:25.588 --> 00:44:34.314]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[00:44:34.314 --> 00:44:39.919]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[00:44:39.919 --> 00:44:45.343]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[00:44:45.563 --> 00:44:48.064]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[00:44:48.064 --> 00:44:50.745]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[00:44:50.745 --> 00:44:52.226]  So go check out the store.
[00:44:52.226 --> 00:44:53.427]  Go support their store.
[00:44:53.427 --> 00:44:54.927]  Go support InfoWars.
[00:44:54.927 --> 00:44:56.288]  Leave a donation right now.
[00:44:56.288 --> 00:44:57.829]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[00:44:57.829 --> 00:45:00.830]  Look at that.
[00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:03.552]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[00:45:03.552 --> 00:45:05.012]  That's because it's been denatured.
[00:45:05.012 --> 00:45:06.153]  It's been watered down.
[00:45:06.153 --> 00:45:08.554]  We didn't do that.
[00:45:08.554 --> 00:45:13.096]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get?
[00:45:13.096 --> 00:45:14.697]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[00:45:15.302 --> 00:45:24.325]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[00:45:24.325 --> 00:45:26.065]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[00:45:26.065 --> 00:45:27.826]  Don't you get the big secret?
[00:45:27.826 --> 00:45:30.407]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[00:45:30.407 --> 00:45:32.287]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[00:45:32.287 --> 00:45:42.770]  And this little jewel right here is solid liquid consciousness.
[00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:44.251]  Look it up.
[00:45:44.251 --> 00:45:44.731]  Find out.
[00:45:46.812 --> 00:45:50.299]  How even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[00:45:50.299 --> 00:45:55.629]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil.
[00:45:55.629 --> 00:45:57.814]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products.
[00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:07.336]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[00:46:07.336 --> 00:46:12.520]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:19.565]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[00:46:19.565 --> 00:46:22.748]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.
[00:46:23.608 --> 00:46:27.771]  And you can do that now at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:46:27.771 --> 00:46:34.214]  Help us clear out our stock of body's turmeric, vitamin C with zinc, and alpha power.
[00:46:34.214 --> 00:46:41.658]  Turn those shady Federal Reserve notes into the highest quality supplements available while they still last.
[00:46:41.658 --> 00:46:44.620]  Now, with free shipping.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:47.162]  We thank you for your support.
[00:46:47.162 --> 00:46:51.144]  And we wish you a very peaceful, happy, and Merry Christmas.
[00:47:00.976 --> 00:47:05.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:06.901]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:47:23.186 --> 00:47:31.448]  America's been taken over by the military-industrial complex, owned and run by big banks, that President Eisenhower warned us of.
[00:47:31.448 --> 00:47:33.828]  He'd be called a treasonous trader today.
[00:47:33.828 --> 00:47:38.449]  The Democrats told us the Russians were meddling in our elections, but they, working with U.S.
[00:47:38.449 --> 00:47:51.612]  intelligence agencies, were criminally, illegally, treasonously surveilling you and censoring you to keep their criminal enterprise going.
[00:47:52.412 --> 00:47:55.696]  So now mainstream news is even reporting, okay, Ukraine are heroes.
[00:47:55.696 --> 00:47:57.118]  They really showed the Russians.
[00:47:57.118 --> 00:48:02.263]  They're now shooting missiles hundreds of miles into Russia and attacking nuclear bases.
[00:48:02.263 --> 00:48:04.586]  How liberal, how loving.
[00:48:04.586 --> 00:48:08.391]  Remember just three months ago, Biden was going to give long range missiles to Ukraine.
[00:48:08.391 --> 00:48:11.174]  Ukraine promised not to use them on Russia, but Biden didn't give them to them.
[00:48:19.554 --> 00:48:21.055]  The missile go over and then boom!
[00:48:21.055 --> 00:48:24.799]  And then you hear the explosion come in.
[00:48:24.799 --> 00:48:34.287]  In radio listeners can't see this but showing footage of it.
[00:48:34.287 --> 00:48:36.829]  So, you hear the missiles shoot over.
[00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:42.513]  You see the flash in the distance.
[00:48:42.513 --> 00:48:43.314]  A few seconds later.
[00:48:43.314 --> 00:48:47.858]  You hear the blast come back.
[00:48:53.246 --> 00:48:59.790]  So now Ukraine is attacking deep inside Russia with missiles.
[00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:01.832]  We've got a ton of old Soviet weapons.
[00:49:01.832 --> 00:49:07.095]  They seem to have used modernized Soviet Tu-141 UAVs.
[00:49:07.095 --> 00:49:09.036]  The slight damage report appears to be true.
[00:49:09.036 --> 00:49:11.718]  No visible damage on fresh satellite pics.
[00:49:11.718 --> 00:49:15.741]  A fuel dump was blown up and several of the nuke bombers damaged reportedly.
[00:49:16.897 --> 00:49:26.652]  Now remember just a few weeks ago, you're supposed to forget about it now, we had to have NATO attack Russia immediately, they fired a missile into Poland, and then it was made up.
[00:49:26.652 --> 00:49:28.474]  It was a Ukrainian missile.
[00:49:28.474 --> 00:49:32.721]  And the Russians said they shot it there on purpose, the trajectory didn't even go towards Russian planes.
[00:49:34.414 --> 00:49:38.697]  Who knows what's really true, but we know we've been lied to over and over again by Zelensky.
[00:49:38.697 --> 00:49:42.620]  But now, real missiles fired into Russia, that's a good thing.
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:44.521]  That's a liberal thing.
[00:49:44.521 --> 00:49:52.246]  And the left is very excited about this, and is all over Twitter and you name it now calling for more missiles to be shot into Russia.
[00:49:52.246 --> 00:49:57.329]  Which, of course, will just escalate things ten times worse.
[00:49:57.329 --> 00:49:58.150]  A pretty big deal.
[00:50:02.765 --> 00:50:03.526]  Set the record straight.
[00:50:03.526 --> 00:50:23.685]  I mean, I asked him to come on, but he's been online setting the record straight, and he's going to be breaking down Operation Paperclip, the New World Order, the huge aftermath of the Kanye West, Gay West Thursday interview that's still one of the biggest stories in the world, was the biggest story in the world for two days, hands down, and just this whole crazy
[00:50:25.171 --> 00:50:28.513]  And as I said, there's a lot of news I haven't gotten to yet, obviously.
[00:50:55.222 --> 00:51:02.628]  But if you missed last night's show, you really missed some incredible information.
[00:51:02.628 --> 00:51:15.418]  Israeli government officials, Japanese government officials, German government officials, UK government officials, US government officials, Canadian government officials, all have come out.
[00:51:15.418 --> 00:51:18.981]  We showed some of the videos, not just the articles.
[00:51:18.981 --> 00:51:20.522]  And in government board meetings,
[00:51:23.897 --> 00:51:44.301]  In government board meetings, with the government heads of their CDCs, their disease control systems, said, no, these shots erase your immune system and do cause cancer, and do cause massive death, and the government knows this, and it's covering it up.
[00:51:44.301 --> 00:51:46.861]  Now, you think I got happy seeing those clips, all vindicated?
[00:51:46.861 --> 00:51:48.882]  No, I'm not happy, because I already knew all that.
[00:51:48.882 --> 00:51:50.622]  It's just so crazy
[00:51:51.587 --> 00:51:53.328]  That they actually did this.
[00:51:53.328 --> 00:52:02.793]  But if you're going to sabotage civilization, if you're going to create a post-industrial world, you've got to go ahead and start cracking a few eggs to make the omelet.
[00:52:02.793 --> 00:52:07.436]  You've got to get the depopulation going.
[00:52:07.436 --> 00:52:11.698]  So I wanted to show you the other side of this, and just tie these articles in.
[00:52:11.698 --> 00:52:14.480]  Let me read the headlines to you, and then I'll tie the articles in.
[00:52:15.279 --> 00:52:16.299]  It's official.
[00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:18.260]  It's out of Euronews.com.
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:25.002]  France banned short-haul domestic flights in favor of train travel.
[00:52:25.002 --> 00:52:34.625]  Now, people in private jets can still fly, but other folks getting on planes that are just going to go two, three, four hours from one side of France to the other?
[00:52:34.625 --> 00:52:38.286]  Sorry, you've got to use the train, the plebs, the slaves,
[00:52:39.787 --> 00:52:46.172]  I can't get on that local flight and go see grandma and get there in two hours because she's in the hospital.
[00:52:46.172 --> 00:52:49.515]  Gotta go to the airport, check in, 30-40 minute flight.
[00:52:49.515 --> 00:52:52.437]  Nope, sorry, gotta take a train.
[00:52:52.437 --> 00:52:56.120]  It's official, France bans short-haul domestic flights in favor of train travel.
[00:52:57.489 --> 00:52:59.390]  What the left called for, they're all getting.
[00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:00.150]  Shock video!
[00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:08.894]  Netherlands police use heavy machinery to overturn tractors with farmers inside because they've announced they're banning up to 90% of their cows in the next five years.
[00:53:08.894 --> 00:53:12.075]  Or carbon taxes, because the gas coming out of a cow's bad.
[00:53:12.075 --> 00:53:13.156]  What's the gas coming out of you?
[00:53:13.156 --> 00:53:16.157]  It's not bad, it's part of the atmosphere.
[00:53:16.157 --> 00:53:24.421]  Oxfordshire Council to run a trial of climate lockdowns starting in a year and one month.
[00:53:27.304 --> 00:53:29.665]  Told you those were coming.
[00:53:29.665 --> 00:53:32.667]  Climate lockdown's coming.
[00:53:32.667 --> 00:53:37.449]  You will be tracked in your suburb and happy about it.
[00:53:37.449 --> 00:53:39.130]  And tracked for your carbon footprint.
[00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:45.033]  Giant report I'll be getting into later with Robert Barnes.
[00:53:45.033 --> 00:53:50.516]  And it goes on from there with this article.
[00:53:52.625 --> 00:54:01.271]  Government database shows a 10,000% increase in cancer reports due to COVID vaccines.
[00:54:01.271 --> 00:54:08.435]  And it shows similar data in governments around the world, not just in places like Germany.
[00:54:08.435 --> 00:54:09.836]  They're killing us.
[00:54:09.836 --> 00:54:11.277]  They're shutting us down.
[00:54:11.277 --> 00:54:13.458]  They said they want to depopulate us.
[00:54:13.458 --> 00:54:20.403]  They talked about diet, injections and injunctions, Bertrand Russell did, to carry this out.
[00:54:22.188 --> 00:54:25.313]  And now they're doing it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:25.313 --> 00:54:26.835]  And people are like, well, that's hard to believe.
[00:54:26.835 --> 00:54:28.998]  Well, you're under attack.
[00:54:28.998 --> 00:54:30.240]  You see it all around you.
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.523]  Opening borders, shutting down pipelines.
[00:54:32.523 --> 00:54:38.512]  Over the weekend, more food processing centers, giant ones, just blew up and burned to the ground, three of them.
[00:54:41.104 --> 00:54:55.078]  They've had thousands and thousands and thousands of times of food processing facilities in Europe, and the United States, and Canada, and Australia, and New Zealand, all blow up, but nowhere else.
[00:54:55.078 --> 00:54:59.142]  Cutting off the pipelines, blowing up the food processing plants, burning them to the ground.
[00:55:00.322 --> 00:55:03.865]  Blowing up the Nord Stream pipeline so Europe wouldn't get gas.
[00:55:03.865 --> 00:55:05.386]  Shutting off our pipelines.
[00:55:05.386 --> 00:55:06.787]  Figured it out yet?
[00:55:06.787 --> 00:55:20.556]  I know it's over the top, like the government, the FBI, the Justice Department, the CIA, ordering major big tech companies, Twitter's just the one we got documents on, to surveil you and censor you and meddle in elections.
[00:55:20.556 --> 00:55:26.000]  It's a criminal takeover.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.001]  They got the chutzpah?
[00:55:28.052 --> 00:55:32.175]  They got the bravado, they got the arrogance to do it, and they think it's all theirs.
[00:55:32.175 --> 00:55:39.219]  And they want to bankrupt it all so they can consolidate control and dictate to you how to live your life.
[00:55:39.219 --> 00:55:41.601]  No cars, no red meat.
[00:55:41.601 --> 00:55:47.384]  And by the way, we're going to make you put these things in your body all the time that kill you.
[00:55:47.384 --> 00:55:49.385]  Yeah, you woke up in a real dystopia.
[00:55:49.385 --> 00:55:52.788]  This isn't some movie you go watch or a scary Netflix series.
[00:55:52.788 --> 00:55:53.588]  This is real.
[00:55:53.588 --> 00:55:54.629]  And the craziest part is,
[00:55:56.676 --> 00:56:06.799]  99.9% of people are going to be directly impacted and hit by this, but still the bureaucrats and the corporate bureaucrats, it's all the same thing, go along with it.
[00:56:06.799 --> 00:56:18.663]  What did the Japanese head professor at Kyoto University at a big government summit meeting about all the vaccine illnesses and sudden death, what did he say?
[00:56:18.663 --> 00:56:20.963]  What did he say there?
[00:56:20.963 --> 00:56:22.744]  He said this is going to destroy the government.
[00:56:23.368 --> 00:56:26.731]  This is going to turn the people against the government, destroy our prestige.
[00:56:26.731 --> 00:56:29.474]  When they find out what you've done, you've got to stop now.
[00:56:29.474 --> 00:56:34.839]  But see, that's in the government globalist document, SPARS 2025-2028 document, that we covered years ago.
[00:56:39.864 --> 00:56:47.086]  That chronicles how they're going to let it even come out they killed you or hurt you and that's designed to destroy society even faster.
[00:56:47.086 --> 00:56:53.848]  They're destroying confidence in the governments that they themselves control because they're going to collapse them all.
[00:56:53.848 --> 00:56:55.048]  They're going to defund the police.
[00:56:55.048 --> 00:57:01.810]  They're going to take everything we've got to bring us beyond our knees to bring us into the grave.
[00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:03.191]  But we're fighting back.
[00:57:03.191 --> 00:57:04.351]  We're saying no.
[00:57:04.351 --> 00:57:06.072]  We're fortifying our immune systems.
[00:57:06.072 --> 00:57:06.472]  It's all a 360 win.
[00:57:08.513 --> 00:57:09.874]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now.

[00:58:50.268 --> 00:59:01.573]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[00:59:01.573 --> 00:59:03.474]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[00:59:03.474 --> 00:59:04.935]  That's what they want to take away.
[00:59:04.935 --> 00:59:06.456]  Your ability to speak freely.
[00:59:06.456 --> 00:59:08.177]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[00:59:08.177 --> 00:59:09.437]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[00:59:09.437 --> 00:59:10.818]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[00:59:11.258 --> 00:59:16.102]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[00:59:16.102 --> 00:59:18.484]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[00:59:18.484 --> 00:59:20.506]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[00:59:20.506 --> 00:59:27.452]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[00:59:28.092 --> 00:59:33.477]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[00:59:33.477 --> 00:59:42.426]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[00:59:42.426 --> 00:59:44.769]  1776 is the promo code.
[00:59:44.769 --> 00:59:48.693]  The destination is InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[00:59:51.863 --> 00:59:56.485]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:56.485 --> 01:00:01.086]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:01.086 --> 01:00:05.988]  Do you support the Chinese people's right to protest?
[01:00:09.457 --> 01:00:16.182]  Do you think it's problematic to do business with the Communist Chinese Party when they suppress human rights?
[01:00:16.182 --> 01:00:24.868]  Have you reached out to them as a matter of national security since we obviously have national security concerns with China who they seem to be aiding in this process?
[01:00:25.168 --> 01:00:28.610]  Sure, I don't have any communications to speak to specifically with Apple executives.
[01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:39.175]  So, when I've told you over the decades that large multinational corporations allied with the dictatorships of the UN run the leadership of the CIA, that's not my opinion.
[01:00:39.175 --> 01:00:51.381]  And now the Carney Endowment former head publicly runs it, and it's come out in the news the last few months that the CIA specifically, illegally, with the Justice Department is meeting with big tech
[01:00:52.432 --> 01:00:59.224]  Corporate dinosaur legacy media and major corporations to set up a social credit score that's already being implemented by stealth.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.944]  To basically debank you, harass you, and later imprison you if you don't go along with them.
[01:01:04.944 --> 01:01:08.466]  So this is a real totalitarian takeover.
[01:01:08.466 --> 01:01:19.734]  Our democracies on both sides of the ocean are being shaken by the same doubts as to our ability to be sufficiently strong and effective when it comes to the challenges we share.
[01:01:19.734 --> 01:01:23.397]  Hate speech, false information, and today's fears.
[01:01:23.397 --> 01:01:28.821]  To me the best way to counter the dissemination of misinformation
[01:01:29.597 --> 01:01:38.886]  We've got to be out there, people who you trust, who are trusted messengers, to get out there and put the truth out.
[01:01:38.886 --> 01:01:48.795]  I don't usually read from a prepared speech, but this is so important that I wanted to make sure that I got every single word and fact, scientific fact, correct.
[01:01:49.515 --> 01:02:02.584]  Before you inject your child, a decision that is irreversible, I wanted to let you know the scientific facts about this genetic vaccine, which is based on the RNA vaccine technology I created.
[01:02:02.584 --> 01:02:07.627]  The first is that a viral gene will be injected into your parent's cells.
[01:02:07.627 --> 01:02:13.231]  This gene forces your child's body to make toxic spike proteins.
[01:02:13.231 --> 01:02:14.332]  It just seems to me
[01:02:15.316 --> 01:02:28.093]  I didn't do a study on it, but from what I'm seeing from my experience is that the people who are spreading misinformation and disinformation seem to be relentless in their pursuit
[01:02:28.943 --> 01:02:30.964]  ...of spreading misinformation.
[01:02:30.964 --> 01:02:36.388]  And if you watch corporate media, you'll see a CIA analyst saying, screw your free speech, it doesn't exist.
[01:02:36.388 --> 01:02:39.930]  Elon Musk is allowing some freedom on Twitter as a Russian agent.
[01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:42.151]  Putin is going to be all over Twitter.
[01:02:42.151 --> 01:02:50.976]  If there's no regulations on this, fake accounts, spoofed accounts, the rest of it, this is a great opportunity for him.
[01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:55.499]  And so when he's talking about the popular voice, Musk, he's really talking about Russian intelligence.
[01:02:55.999 --> 01:03:01.405]  Do you think that users have a right to freedom of speech even if what they're saying is wrong or offensive?
[01:03:01.405 --> 01:03:01.605]  I think...
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:22.265]  That one human being should not decide how millions of people communicate with each other.
[01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:30.552]  One human being should not be able to go into a dark room by himself and decide, oh, that person gets heard from, that person doesn't.
[01:03:30.552 --> 01:03:31.713]  That's not how it should work.
[01:03:32.307 --> 01:03:39.613]  It says, Twitter provides a global communication platform which encompasses a variety of users with different voices, ideas, and perspectives.
[01:03:39.613 --> 01:03:45.277]  As a policy, we do not mediate content or intervene in disputes between users.
[01:03:45.277 --> 01:03:47.459]  This is all just the First Amendment law.
[01:03:47.459 --> 01:03:55.025]  And they say down here, if you believe content or behavior you are reporting is prohibited in your local jurisdiction, please contact your local authorities.
[01:03:55.025 --> 01:04:01.710]  This is the sleight of hand that the establishment has done, is they've equated free speech with hate speech.
[01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:10.478]  So if you're for free speech, you're against minority groups because then people will be able to hurl hate speech at them.
[01:04:10.478 --> 01:04:15.283]  And so you should be against free speech because it hurts minority groups.
[01:04:15.283 --> 01:04:18.406]  The only thing minority groups have is their speech.
[01:04:19.347 --> 01:04:20.468]  Words can be weapons.
[01:04:20.468 --> 01:04:24.391]  Hate speech online can lead to cruelty and violence in real life.
[01:04:24.391 --> 01:04:33.758]  The UN report says ban people's speech because it might make somebody do something bad when they flood our countries with third world populations filled with hate for us.
[01:04:33.758 --> 01:04:35.700]  If you criticize it, you get arrested.
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:36.741]  Markets like actually...
[01:04:37.341 --> 01:04:38.742]  So this is the control, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:00.492 --> 01:05:09.317]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:05:09.317 --> 01:05:13.159]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:22.224]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company and they're able to cut our regular shipping costs by up to 50%.
[01:05:22.224 --> 01:05:24.266]  So that means even on orders that are below $50,
[01:05:25.026 --> 01:05:28.468]  You're going to be paying way lower than you were previously.
[01:05:28.468 --> 01:05:29.929]  This is a game changer.
[01:05:29.929 --> 01:05:31.450]  We're so excited about it.
[01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:33.711]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[01:05:33.711 --> 01:05:38.154]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[01:05:38.154 --> 01:05:41.276]  So now, your orders will be shipped even faster.
[01:05:41.276 --> 01:05:43.717]  The same great customer service and more.
[01:05:43.717 --> 01:05:49.140]  So, get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[01:05:50.401 --> 01:05:57.122]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system, lead a healthier life, and keep Infowars on the air.
[01:05:57.122 --> 01:05:57.662]  Infowars.com.
[01:05:57.662 --> 01:06:06.004]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:06.004 --> 01:06:13.325]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:26.661]  Well, you have found it, the undoubted, undisputed tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty against the New World Order.
[01:06:26.661 --> 01:06:29.762]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:06:29.762 --> 01:06:34.862]  And I wanted to get Hotep Jesus on, a really smart commentator.
[01:06:34.862 --> 01:06:49.605]  I wanted to get him on today because there is just so much to talk about, so much to break down, dealing with the Kanye West interview that happened on Thursday that undoubtedly has
[01:06:50.748 --> 01:06:52.389]  Probably a billion views out there or more.
[01:06:52.389 --> 01:06:53.629]  It's been on every TV station.
[01:06:53.629 --> 01:06:55.970]  Basically every commentator's talked about it.
[01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:59.832]  Everything from Saturday Night Live to CNN.
[01:06:59.832 --> 01:07:02.133]  And they misrepresented a lot of what was said.
[01:07:02.133 --> 01:07:06.015]  I'm not defending some of the things that Ye did say here on air.
[01:07:06.835 --> 01:07:16.517]  But the issue is, is that our own government brought 30-plus thousand Nazis back in World War II to help set up the modern system in Eisenhower, warned about the military-industrial complex.
[01:07:16.517 --> 01:07:20.138]  And we have infanticide, and humans smuggling across the borders, and all this going on.
[01:07:20.138 --> 01:07:29.741]  And obviously, he had to be provocative, and to really plant his foot on the First Amendment, and plant his flag there.
[01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:30.981]  But there's a lot of
[01:07:32.301 --> 01:07:32.961]  Hey, thank you, man.
[01:07:32.961 --> 01:07:33.781]  Let's start right here.
[01:07:33.781 --> 01:07:34.941]  There's no such thing as hate speech.
[01:07:34.941 --> 01:07:36.002]  Full stop.
[01:07:36.002 --> 01:07:37.382]  There is no such thing as hate speech.
[01:08:01.514 --> 01:08:05.637]  Speech needs somebody to interpret it.
[01:08:05.637 --> 01:08:08.920]  Therefore, hate speech is subjective.
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:12.943]  Canyon Hotep spoke about this on his feed today.
[01:08:12.943 --> 01:08:23.691]  And really what it takes is on one side, somebody says one thing, somebody dislikes it, but there's probably a group of people on the other side who agree with it.
[01:08:23.691 --> 01:08:30.596]  When we look at speech hurled at black people, people might describe me as a black man, African-American, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:08:31.198 --> 01:08:36.421]  And let's say this is some white nationalist group, Nazi, or whatever they identify as.
[01:08:36.421 --> 01:08:44.286]  And, uh, they have some gripes with my people, people like me, people of my skin color.
[01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:45.747]  I care.
[01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:52.051]  I care about what they have to say because I truly understand that their problem isn't with me.
[01:08:52.051 --> 01:08:58.094]  There's some sort of shortcoming happening in their life and I happen to be the scapegoat.
[01:08:58.094 --> 01:09:00.676]  So let's look, let's look at Ye last week in his comments.
[01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:13.946]  Ye, if you watch the beginning of the series with you, and then you watch the end of that broadcast, you see two different people.
[01:09:13.946 --> 01:09:16.788]  What happened when Ye went to other platforms?
[01:09:16.788 --> 01:09:24.132]  They were cutting him off, they were silencing, they were disagreeing with him, but they weren't allowing him to get what he wanted off of his chest.
[01:09:24.132 --> 01:09:30.096]  What you often find is, if you give people room to breathe, give people room to vent, what happens?
[01:09:31.641 --> 01:09:32.761]  They start to capitulate.
[01:09:32.761 --> 01:09:34.982]  They start to even out.
[01:09:34.982 --> 01:09:37.542]  They start to be a little bit kinder.
[01:09:37.542 --> 01:09:44.703]  And we saw that with Ye, where he's, you know, he basically was spreading a message of love by the end of that interview.
[01:09:44.703 --> 01:09:51.044]  This is what happens when you let people speak and you find out that it's not hate speech, it's actually venting.
[01:09:51.044 --> 01:09:54.405]  Do we really want to get to the core of what's wrong?
[01:09:54.405 --> 01:09:59.646]  For example, when we look at racism in the South, although I don't condone it and the acts of that and have been
[01:10:00.569 --> 01:10:02.690]  Done against my people.
[01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:09.032]  I do understand that certain concessions were made after the Civil War that angered whites.
[01:10:09.032 --> 01:10:10.792]  Especially poor whites.
[01:10:10.792 --> 01:10:13.593]  And they saw some sort of unfair treatment.
[01:10:13.593 --> 01:10:17.434]  Really what we're dealing with is, there seems to be some arbiter.
[01:10:17.434 --> 01:10:21.476]  Some people call it the government, some people call it deep state, whatever you want to call it.
[01:10:21.476 --> 01:10:22.156]  I don't know.
[01:10:22.156 --> 01:10:25.517]  I don't live on that level of this building.
[01:10:26.368 --> 01:10:32.729]  But there's some arbiter, and this arbiter is the one who's defining what hate speech is.
[01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:36.970]  Hate speech does not need, I mean, speech does not need an arbiter.
[01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:45.931]  When we talk about the First Amendment, the First Amendment was absolute, and it was created to protect so-called hate speech.
[01:10:45.931 --> 01:10:51.912]  If we didn't have the ability to vent our gripes with groups of individuals, nobody would know it.
[01:10:51.912 --> 01:10:55.173]  So, for example, we talk about white nationalist or so-called hate groups,
[01:10:55.879 --> 01:10:59.602]  What happens when you don't allow them a spaced event?
[01:10:59.602 --> 01:11:01.464]  Well, they go into hiding.
[01:11:01.464 --> 01:11:07.609]  And that's the last thing you want somebody who has vitriol to do, is to go into hiding someplace where you can't see them.
[01:11:07.609 --> 01:11:11.272]  Now they start plotting, and then you have terrorist events, etc, etc.
[01:11:12.452 --> 01:11:20.337]  However, if you said, listen, we hear you, you have some certain gripes towards certain people, why don't we give you a platform to express those gripes?
[01:11:20.337 --> 01:11:22.258]  And then we open up conversation.
[01:11:22.258 --> 01:11:24.780]  You see, the same thing happens in relationships.
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:35.887]  You often find that relationships between men and women and, you know, marriage, whatever it may be, they tend to fall apart when there's a breakdown in communication, zero communication or lack of communication.
[01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:47.455]  However, if both sides truly vent what their problem is, and the other side wants to listen, this is the other part of this argument that needs to be had.
[01:11:47.455 --> 01:11:50.917]  One side needs to vent, and the other side needs to listen.
[01:11:50.917 --> 01:11:53.718]  They probably teach this in marriage counseling.
[01:11:53.718 --> 01:12:01.422]  What happens is, one side vents their side, and the other side wants to vent their side, and now you have two people yelling at each other, two groups yelling at each other.
[01:12:01.422 --> 01:12:02.502]  No!
[01:12:02.502 --> 01:12:05.804]  One side needs to vent, and the other side needs to listen.
[01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:09.453]  And that's what people in America have a problem doing.
[01:12:09.453 --> 01:12:16.540]  What happens is they react to these things with their emotions and not their mind.
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:17.761]  They don't really analyze.
[01:12:17.761 --> 01:12:20.484]  They don't use logic when people speak.
[01:12:20.484 --> 01:12:23.106]  All they do is say, I don't like what you said.
[01:12:23.106 --> 01:12:26.510]  My feelings are hurt.
[01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:27.531]  We saw that with the left.
[01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:32.274]  You know, the right had certain opinions, certain ideologies.
[01:12:32.274 --> 01:12:36.415]  Trump said certain things and all we heard was wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.
[01:12:36.415 --> 01:12:41.596]  Then yay, gets on Alex Jones' platform, the greatest platform on earth.
[01:12:41.596 --> 01:12:43.437]  And what happened?
[01:12:43.437 --> 01:12:45.077]  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.
[01:12:45.077 --> 01:12:47.898]  From everybody, all across the aisle.
[01:12:47.898 --> 01:12:54.499]  I was surprised to see so many people who claimed free speech, all of a sudden weren't for free speech.
[01:12:54.499 --> 01:12:57.320]  Now, before we dive down that rabbit hole,
[01:12:58.948 --> 01:13:03.769]  The First Amendment was supposed to protect us from the government.
[01:13:03.769 --> 01:13:07.870]  The government is supposed to say, you have the right to speak.
[01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:08.810]  But you know what?
[01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:12.150]  Today, government's not the problem.
[01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:13.211]  We are.
[01:13:13.211 --> 01:13:14.331]  You are.
[01:13:14.331 --> 01:13:15.591]  I am.
[01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:19.952]  Well, definitely not me, because I'm a free speech absolutionist.
[01:13:19.952 --> 01:13:24.072]  But when people speak, we're ready to respond with vitriol.
[01:13:24.072 --> 01:13:25.973]  We're ready to condemn.
[01:13:25.973 --> 01:13:27.053]  We don't listen anymore.
[01:13:27.637 --> 01:13:34.661]  When I see people get on the internet and they spread their opinions, whether I agree with them or not, it doesn't affect my life.
[01:13:34.661 --> 01:13:36.962]  It doesn't take food out of my children's mouth.
[01:13:36.962 --> 01:13:38.022]  It doesn't affect me.
[01:13:38.022 --> 01:13:41.104]  So I say, oh, well, that's that person's opinion.
[01:13:41.104 --> 01:13:44.826]  Why do I need to express my opinion on somebody else's opinion?
[01:13:44.826 --> 01:13:46.267]  That's what I want to know.
[01:13:46.267 --> 01:13:50.589]  Why is it when Ye speaks, everybody has to pick up their phone and say something?
[01:13:51.522 --> 01:13:55.823]  Do you realize that he would be impotent if nobody reacted?
[01:13:55.823 --> 01:13:57.744]  This is the lesson he's trying to teach you.
[01:13:57.744 --> 01:14:00.425]  He's like, you guys can't help but to react.
[01:14:00.425 --> 01:14:05.026]  So what do you think his main goal was coming here and doing what he did?
[01:14:05.026 --> 01:14:13.889]  He wants people to look in the mirror and see how hypocritical they truly are.
[01:14:13.889 --> 01:14:15.750]  You are a hypocrite.
[01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:17.030]  He wants people to see that
[01:14:18.306 --> 01:14:19.326]  On one hand, right?
[01:14:19.326 --> 01:14:20.426]  What happened?
[01:14:20.426 --> 01:14:22.907]  Oh, I wore the White Lives Matter shirt.
[01:14:22.907 --> 01:14:25.087]  And everybody said, Oh, yay, we love it.
[01:14:25.087 --> 01:14:26.087]  Let him speak.
[01:14:26.087 --> 01:14:29.128]  And then he said something about another group of people.
[01:14:29.128 --> 01:14:32.169]  And now all of a sudden we have to cancel them.
[01:14:32.169 --> 01:14:33.069]  This is hypocritical.
[01:14:33.069 --> 01:14:34.629]  This is bigotry.
[01:14:34.629 --> 01:14:36.089]  And he wants to point that out.
[01:14:36.089 --> 01:14:39.990]  He wants to point out how easily people are disturbed.
[01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:45.011]  I think his real goal is to filter out who's with him and who's not.
[01:14:46.405 --> 01:14:50.507]  He went to the White Lives Matter side, filtered a lot of people out.
[01:14:50.507 --> 01:14:54.450]  Then he went this alternate route, filtered even more people out.
[01:14:54.450 --> 01:14:57.591]  He's trying to see who's really real.
[01:14:57.591 --> 01:15:02.254]  Who stands on their own ideologies, morals.
[01:15:03.126 --> 01:15:06.769]  We've got to go to break, but I want to tie this in to Elon Musk.
[01:15:06.769 --> 01:15:11.853]  Now the Twitter file is coming out that proved the government illegally election meddling all of it.
[01:15:11.853 --> 01:15:18.578]  But Elon said, I'm a free speech absolutist, but now he's not with myself or Ye or anybody else.
[01:15:18.578 --> 01:15:25.123]  And then he supports the Azov battalion, literally doing Hitler rituals on Twitter.
[01:15:25.123 --> 01:15:26.204]  I'm going to show this when we come back.
[01:15:27.077 --> 01:15:34.083]  But then, Ye puts up a Raelian symbol of unification of the swastika and the Star of David, and he gets banned for that.
[01:15:34.083 --> 01:15:35.985]  I see it as very hypocritical.
[01:15:35.985 --> 01:15:37.346]  Hotep Jesus, our guest.
[01:15:37.346 --> 01:15:39.268]  HotepJesus.com.
[01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:40.969]  We'll be right back with Hotep on the other side.

[01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:45.974]  This is an important discussion.
[01:15:45.974 --> 01:15:46.534]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:46.534 --> 01:15:46.915]  Stay with us.

[01:16:40.294 --> 01:16:40.675]  Thank you.
[01:16:58.996 --> 01:17:10.484]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[01:17:10.484 --> 01:17:14.947]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[01:17:14.947 --> 01:17:18.910]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:22.392]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[01:17:22.392 --> 01:17:23.653]  You see, the sun
[01:17:25.134 --> 01:17:25.434]  We're good to

[01:17:59.031 --> 01:18:10.519]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:14.981]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[01:18:14.981 --> 01:18:18.944]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:23.367]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[01:18:23.367 --> 01:18:24.448]  You see, the sun
[01:18:25.168 --> 01:18:25.468]  We're good to
[01:18:50.694 --> 01:19:01.560]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:05.562]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[01:19:05.562 --> 01:19:06.903]  There's a solution.
[01:19:06.903 --> 01:19:07.883]  The Wellness Company.
[01:19:07.883 --> 01:19:11.185]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[01:19:11.185 --> 01:19:18.389]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[01:19:18.649 --> 01:19:44.704]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[01:19:45.806 --> 01:19:46.287]  I think so.
[01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:18.766]  So what's really going on with Elon Musk?
[01:20:18.766 --> 01:20:21.829]  He says he's for free speech or free speech absolutist.
[01:20:21.829 --> 01:20:23.771]  I wasn't banned off of Twitter for saying it.
[01:20:23.771 --> 01:20:25.652]  I wasn't being discussed and I was banned.
[01:20:25.652 --> 01:20:31.397]  They just hyped that up and basically exaggerated it, made it all up before they sued me with a big PR firm they hired.
[01:20:31.397 --> 01:20:33.479]  But he said no, no, Alex Jones is the worst.
[01:20:33.479 --> 01:20:34.940]  He didn't get to come back.
[01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:35.901]  And then with
[01:20:37.876 --> 01:20:40.058]  Yay, formerly Kanye West.
[01:20:40.058 --> 01:20:42.681]  He posts a picture of a starved able with a swastika in the middle.
[01:20:42.681 --> 01:20:51.208]  It's a New Age Raelian flying saucer cult out of Francis symbol as just a test and he gets banned on Friday night.
[01:20:52.150 --> 01:20:54.452]  And so what's really going on with Elon?
[01:20:54.452 --> 01:21:07.541]  Here's a short clip of Elon having a chat that was public, but wasn't promoted, Saturday, where he talks about wanting to punch Kanye for, I guess, not just posting the symbol, but what he said on my show.
[01:21:09.062 --> 01:21:12.744]  It was like, you know, where that was my decision.
[01:21:12.744 --> 01:21:16.926]  But I think it's important that people know, okay, that was my decision.
[01:21:16.926 --> 01:21:20.247]  Because at a certain point, you have to say, what is incitement to violence?
[01:21:20.247 --> 01:21:22.528]  Because that is against the law in the US.
[01:21:22.528 --> 01:21:27.711]  You can't just have a, you know, form a club, let's go murder someone club.
[01:21:27.711 --> 01:21:29.571]  You know, that's not actually legal.
[01:21:29.571 --> 01:21:32.413]  So the question is, what is incitement to violence?
[01:21:32.413 --> 01:21:37.175]  I think, you know, posting swastikas in what is obviously not a
[01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:39.211]  You mentioned in a good way.
[01:21:56.255 --> 01:22:02.400]  It's just that, like, it could be like an analysis of the Second World War or something, you know?
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:05.422]  That's a history drama or whatever, you know?
[01:22:05.422 --> 01:22:07.364]  It's contextual.
[01:22:07.364 --> 01:22:20.754]  Yeah, it's like, okay, you know, like, let's live on a battlefield or something, and that's got, you know, this, you know, some sort of, you know, war history thing.
[01:22:20.754 --> 01:22:21.234]  I don't know.
[01:22:21.234 --> 01:22:22.115]  Yeah, something like that.
[01:22:22.115 --> 01:22:22.956]  Then that would be okay.
[01:22:24.311 --> 01:22:25.672]  Yeah, it has to be conceptual.
[01:22:25.672 --> 01:22:31.777]  I mean, if he's posting it in a way that is trying to rally people to anti-Semitic views, then yeah.
[01:22:31.777 --> 01:22:39.183]  Yeah, I mean, it can also, like, say, like, okay, well, let's look for added context outside of Twitter to say, like, well, was this meant in a
[01:22:40.134 --> 01:22:41.015]  Alex Jones is pretty edgy.
[01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:12.765]  But I want to get into some sort of huge like this could easily get derailed into
[01:23:13.982 --> 01:23:22.411]  Okay, so I want to be clear.
[01:23:22.411 --> 01:23:31.400]  My disagreeing with Ye, where he's being provocative, is different than wanting to punch him in the face, which I didn't want to, or censoring him.
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:37.006]  So what Elon just admitted was he banned him for off-platform activity on my show.
[01:23:38.257 --> 01:23:45.551]  And then he put out a symbol of a swastika with a Star of David and said that was incitement to violence.
[01:23:45.551 --> 01:23:47.475]  This is a fraud what Elon just said.
[01:23:47.475 --> 01:23:49.379]  Hotep, what do you say?
[01:23:50.322 --> 01:23:52.163]  Yeah, totally.
[01:23:52.163 --> 01:23:54.866]  Again, this is what Ye wanted to expose.
[01:23:54.866 --> 01:24:01.290]  He wanted to expose the hypocrisy where somebody is being applauded for being a proponent of free speech.
[01:24:01.290 --> 01:24:09.257]  And yet, here we have a guy who won't re-platform Alex Jones and de-platformed Ye.
[01:24:09.257 --> 01:24:11.378]  Let's look at Elon.
[01:24:11.378 --> 01:24:16.422]  Some of the decisions that Elon is making regarding this shows me how powerful Elon is not.
[01:24:18.344 --> 01:24:19.966]  It's powerful enough to buy Twitter.
[01:24:19.966 --> 01:24:24.650]  It's not powerful enough to run Twitter how it should be run.
[01:24:24.650 --> 01:24:31.036]  The symbol that Ye posted, like you said, from a Raelian association.
[01:24:31.036 --> 01:24:38.744]  Therefore, Elon never did any research on to, you know, that symbol to see what it represented.
[01:24:39.544 --> 01:24:40.665]  Also, what are you going to do?
[01:24:40.665 --> 01:24:43.528]  Are you going to cancel Buddha because he's got a swastika on his stomach?
[01:24:43.528 --> 01:24:44.969]  Is that where we're at right now?
[01:24:44.969 --> 01:24:52.836]  Are we going to ignore the history behind this symbol outside of the idea of it in World War II?
[01:24:52.836 --> 01:24:55.879]  Are we going to ban the yin-yang next?
[01:24:55.879 --> 01:24:59.302]  So there's that piece, but I think this might have been personal.
[01:24:59.302 --> 01:25:00.323]  I think because
[01:25:02.250 --> 01:25:05.632]  Yay won't bow down to the power of Elon.
[01:25:05.632 --> 01:25:07.593]  Elon said, oh, you're testing me.
[01:25:07.593 --> 01:25:09.875]  You know, F around and find out.
[01:25:09.875 --> 01:25:12.796]  That's what he posted after he suspended.
[01:25:12.796 --> 01:25:13.537]  Yay.
[01:25:13.537 --> 01:25:23.162]  So this is more of an ego battle where Elon is saying, how dare you challenge me in front of the world and putting me on the spot?
[01:25:23.162 --> 01:25:26.484]  Elon is feeling the pressure of the powers that be.
[01:25:26.484 --> 01:25:27.965]  He's not fighting them.
[01:25:27.965 --> 01:25:28.886]  If he was fighting them,
[01:25:29.446 --> 01:25:31.228]  He'd be managing a platform differently.
[01:25:31.228 --> 01:25:36.673]  For example, when we look at the Twitter files, I was very unimpressed by the Twitter files.
[01:25:36.673 --> 01:25:39.635]  Let's just be honest.
[01:25:39.635 --> 01:25:47.162]  Yes, some things did support some of the arguments we were making about collusion between the government and big tech.
[01:25:47.162 --> 01:25:48.183]  Yes, we know about this.
[01:25:48.183 --> 01:25:49.144]  We have the evidence now.
[01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:49.584]  Great.
[01:25:49.584 --> 01:25:51.526]  However, we didn't have the full string of emails.
[01:25:55.623 --> 01:25:58.404]  Why wasn't this stuff exposed WikiLeaks style?
[01:25:58.404 --> 01:26:00.025]  Why was it given to one journalist?
[01:26:00.025 --> 01:26:06.549]  And I think, you know, Matt did a good job, you know, making this thing into a story type thread for the masses.
[01:26:06.549 --> 01:26:07.129]  No, exactly.
[01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:08.930]  Why doesn't he just dump them to the whole public?
[01:26:10.114 --> 01:26:13.178]  Why didn't he dump him to the public, exactly?
[01:26:13.178 --> 01:26:15.680]  Remember what Fredo said?
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:17.703]  Remember what Fredo said to interrupt?
[01:26:17.703 --> 01:26:24.610]  Fredo, Chris Cuomo on CNN said like five years ago, journalists can look at WikiLeaks, you're not allowed to as a public.
[01:26:24.610 --> 01:26:29.436]  How condescending, and that's exactly what Elon just did, was to Chris Cuomo.
[01:26:30.791 --> 01:26:32.775]  Well, that's exactly it.
[01:26:32.775 --> 01:26:43.414]  So Matt, he brings it out storybook style, but this is an insult to our intelligence, basically saying we have to feed this to them like Dr. Seuss.
[01:26:44.275 --> 01:26:52.900]  Why not give it to us WikiLeaks style like 2016 and allow all the journalists, all the independent media to go and dive into the files.
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:27:01.346]  However, I know there may be some sensitive things in there, but your team should have gone through, redacted some of the sensitive materials, but did a full dump.
[01:27:01.346 --> 01:27:04.207]  When I heard the title, so this was marketing, right?
[01:27:04.207 --> 01:27:07.710]  When you say Twitter files, but we don't get Twitter files.
[01:27:07.710 --> 01:27:09.771]  What we got were Twitter screenshots.
[01:27:09.771 --> 01:27:09.971]  You should
[01:27:10.731 --> 01:27:13.213]  We get it filtered through Matt Taibbi.
[01:27:13.213 --> 01:27:17.415]  What we got was filtered pap.
[01:27:17.415 --> 01:27:18.676]  It was filtered.
[01:27:18.676 --> 01:27:19.777]  And I was unimpressed.
[01:27:19.777 --> 01:27:22.478]  And people said, Hotez, how could you say that?
[01:27:22.478 --> 01:27:24.740]  I'm like, you're insulting my intelligence.
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:25.980]  I want the full dump.
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:27.741]  I want the full emails.
[01:27:27.741 --> 01:27:33.785]  So if I were to figure out why didn't Elon give us the full dump, well, it's probably because he's scared.
[01:27:34.225 --> 01:27:39.994]  It's probably because he's afraid to upset the deep state.
[01:27:39.994 --> 01:27:47.826]  What some people have speculated in my Twitter feed is that this was more of a blackmail type situation.
[01:27:49.568 --> 01:27:50.768]  I got this.
[01:27:50.768 --> 01:27:51.729]  Don't mess with me.
[01:27:51.729 --> 01:27:52.829]  I could do a full dump.
[01:27:52.829 --> 01:27:55.310]  But he didn't want to do the full dump yet.
[01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:56.911]  So this isn't about the truth.
[01:27:56.911 --> 01:27:58.211]  This isn't about the people.
[01:27:58.211 --> 01:28:02.853]  This is about Elon saying, you guys attacking me and my platform.
[01:28:02.853 --> 01:28:03.873]  I can attack back.
[01:28:03.873 --> 01:28:06.294]  This is a personal thing between Elon and the deep state.
[01:28:06.294 --> 01:28:08.695]  It has nothing to do with freedom and truth.
[01:28:08.695 --> 01:28:09.135]  I agree.
[01:28:09.135 --> 01:28:11.516]  I think Elon's horning in on the deep state.
[01:28:11.516 --> 01:28:13.297]  I think he's not trying to free things overall.
[01:28:13.297 --> 01:28:14.217]  I think he's trying to take it over.
[01:28:15.416 --> 01:28:20.841]  Yes, but also look how Trump's name was implicated in this situation.
[01:28:20.841 --> 01:28:24.765]  So Matt decided to put that one thing about, oh, Trump called in.
[01:28:24.765 --> 01:28:27.828]  So this is also destabilizing Trump's platform.
[01:28:27.828 --> 01:28:28.829]  This isn't about freedom.
[01:28:28.829 --> 01:28:31.431]  This isn't, you know, bipartisan.
[01:28:31.431 --> 01:28:33.153]  This is an Elon thing.
[01:28:34.275 --> 01:28:35.636]  All right, Hotep Jesus.
[01:28:35.636 --> 01:28:37.798]  HotepJesus.com is where you find everything he's doing.
[01:28:37.798 --> 01:28:38.439]  It's amazing.
[01:28:38.439 --> 01:28:44.804]  We're going to come back and cover the waterfront here and play that clip where Twitter promotes the Azov battalions.
[01:28:44.804 --> 01:28:47.747]  And folks, if there's any real Nazis in the world, they're in Ukraine.
[01:28:47.747 --> 01:28:50.529]  I mean, these are the real deal.
[01:28:50.529 --> 01:28:54.713]  That's not some Klan guy living in a shack by the railroad tracks.
[01:28:54.713 --> 01:28:55.374]  This is a real deal.
[01:28:58.697 --> 01:29:08.244]  Christmas 2022 is almost here, and we have great products at InfoWarsTore.com that empower your body, your libido, your immune system, that just enrich your life.
[01:29:08.244 --> 01:29:15.949]  So whether it's Vitamin Mineral Fusion, or DNA Force Plus, or Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, they're all still in stock, discounted up to 60% with promo code 1776.
[01:29:15.949 --> 01:29:16.389]  And now, finally,
[01:29:18.971 --> 01:29:26.957]  We have brought back free shipping at infowarestore.com on orders of $50 or more and big discounts on the regular shipping as well.
[01:29:26.957 --> 01:29:34.722]  Plus the book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, signed or unsigned, it's also available with free shipping at infowarestore.com.
[01:29:34.722 --> 01:29:41.427]  So again, that's free shipping on all orders, $50 or more at infowarestore.com.
[01:29:41.707 --> 01:29:42.307]  We're good to go!
[01:29:58.891 --> 01:30:07.715]  December 2022 is here, and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at infowarestore.com.
[01:30:07.715 --> 01:30:11.557]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[01:30:11.557 --> 01:30:20.621]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company, and they're able to cut our regular shipping costs by up to 50%.
[01:30:20.621 --> 01:30:22.662]  So that means even on orders that are below $50,
[01:30:23.422 --> 01:30:26.844]  You're going to be paying way lower than you were previously.
[01:30:26.844 --> 01:30:28.325]  This is a game changer.
[01:30:28.325 --> 01:30:29.867]  We're so excited about it.
[01:30:29.867 --> 01:30:32.128]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[01:30:32.128 --> 01:30:36.551]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[01:30:36.551 --> 01:30:39.674]  So now, your orders will be shipped even faster.
[01:30:39.674 --> 01:30:42.115]  The same great customer service and more.
[01:30:42.115 --> 01:30:47.879]  So, get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:58.768]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system, lead a healthier life, and keep Inforwards on the air at InforwardsTour.com.
[01:30:58.768 --> 01:31:04.733]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[01:31:06.047 --> 01:31:16.417]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[01:31:16.417 --> 01:31:29.169]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:30.350]  Thank you.
[01:31:59.361 --> 01:32:06.308]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[01:32:06.308 --> 01:32:12.194]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[01:32:12.194 --> 01:32:18.540]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:26.087]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[01:32:26.087 --> 01:32:36.376]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[01:32:36.776 --> 01:32:45.785]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[01:32:45.785 --> 01:32:52.392]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[01:32:52.392 --> 01:32:58.599]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:05.034]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:05.034 --> 01:33:06.335]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:33:26.451 --> 01:33:31.072]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.072 --> 01:33:33.273]  And Hotep Jesus riding shotgun with us.
[01:33:33.273 --> 01:33:40.114]  Hotep, I want to show this tweet here that really was probably the thing that got Ye banned.
[01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:50.497]  It's Emanuel, the big Hollywood kingpin on a yacht, this year spring, Elon off there.
[01:33:50.497 --> 01:33:54.958]  And let's always remember, this is my final tweet, said Ye.
[01:33:56.656 --> 01:33:58.197]  Is that really what's going on?
[01:33:58.197 --> 01:33:59.658]  Is that really what has angered Elon?
[01:33:59.658 --> 01:34:02.360]  But I want to play this because a lot of people pointed this out.
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:07.144]  The Azov battalions are the main shock troop military of Ukraine.
[01:34:07.144 --> 01:34:16.811]  For those that don't know, World War II got fought, a lot of it, between the Russians and the Nazis, once Operation Barbarossa started, in Ukraine.
[01:34:16.811 --> 01:34:23.656]  And so the western part was Nazi, the eastern part was Russian, and that was some of the biggest battles and millions dead there.
[01:34:25.066 --> 01:34:29.370]  And so Zelensky got questioned earlier this year about the Nazi affiliation of the Azov Battalion.
[01:34:29.370 --> 01:34:31.351]  He said, yeah, they are who they are.
[01:34:31.351 --> 01:34:35.295]  That's because they all have swastikas and twin thunderbolts on them.
[01:34:35.295 --> 01:34:37.096]  They hail Hitler.
[01:34:37.096 --> 01:34:39.138]  They worship Hitler.
[01:34:39.138 --> 01:34:40.359]  And Hitler was not a Christian.
[01:34:40.359 --> 01:34:42.301]  He was an occultist.
[01:34:42.301 --> 01:34:45.323]  Kind of followed kind of a Norse religion.
[01:34:45.323 --> 01:34:46.845]  And they had a blood and soil ritual.
[01:34:47.563 --> 01:34:53.451]  Where they would cut themselves and go into a false grave in the soil and bleed into the ground and put all their blood into it.
[01:34:53.451 --> 01:34:56.075]  And that was a ritual the SS did.
[01:34:56.075 --> 01:35:04.186]  And so you go to the official Ukrainian websites, or government websites on Twitter, they actually show their rituals of them hailing Hitler.
[01:35:04.793 --> 01:35:06.754]  We're going to show you footage of this with audio, guys.
[01:35:06.754 --> 01:35:08.174]  I'm going to play it here in a moment.
[01:35:08.174 --> 01:35:13.155]  It's only 44 seconds of them worshipping Odin, which I'm not saying that's bad if you like Odin.
[01:35:13.155 --> 01:35:13.936]  That's not Nazi.
[01:35:13.936 --> 01:35:17.737]  But it's a blood and soil ritual.
[01:35:17.737 --> 01:35:24.919]  Carving runes in their arms of twin lightning bolts and going into a grave and putting their hand in all the other blood of others.
[01:35:26.058 --> 01:35:26.559]  We're good to go.
[01:35:43.974 --> 01:35:50.278]  And using the swastika for the symbol of their flag going into war, which is violence.
[01:35:50.278 --> 01:35:57.643]  So here's what Twitter allows versus what they did to Ye.
[01:35:57.643 --> 01:36:01.025]  Here it is.
[01:36:01.025 --> 01:36:01.725]  Protect the people!
[01:36:01.725 --> 01:36:02.666]  Protect yourself!
[01:36:02.666 --> 01:36:03.946]  Protect the people!
[01:36:03.946 --> 01:36:05.587]  Protect yourself!
[01:36:05.587 --> 01:36:06.468]  Here!
[01:36:06.468 --> 01:36:08.269]  Here!
[01:36:08.269 --> 01:36:09.470]  Be here!
[01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:10.430]  Be here!
[01:36:22.962 --> 01:36:24.807]  Glory to the defense!
[01:36:24.807 --> 01:36:27.874]  Glory to our heroes!
[01:36:27.874 --> 01:36:31.422]  Glory to the defense!
[01:36:38.427 --> 01:36:40.008]  All right, so back that up ten seconds.
[01:36:40.008 --> 01:36:43.309]  Show the guy putting his hand on Odin with the big swastika on his arm.
[01:36:43.309 --> 01:36:45.270]  My point is, these are real Nazis.
[01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:48.072]  A government-run military in a war.
[01:36:48.072 --> 01:36:49.473]  Leftovers of World War II.
[01:36:49.473 --> 01:36:51.894]  Like, you don't get more Nazi on the whole planet.
[01:36:51.894 --> 01:36:54.295]  It's like saying, well, that's a purebred Pit Bull.
[01:36:54.295 --> 01:36:55.856]  That's a purebred German Shepherd.
[01:36:55.856 --> 01:36:57.617]  That's a purebred Chihuahua.
[01:36:57.617 --> 01:36:59.918]  Like, this is the real McCoy.
[01:37:00.578 --> 01:37:03.681]  Okay, it's like saying Tom Brady's the quarterback.
[01:37:03.681 --> 01:37:05.062]  Like, who's the best NFL quarterback?
[01:37:05.062 --> 01:37:05.562]  Tom Brady.
[01:37:05.562 --> 01:37:08.325]  Like, this is the purebred.
[01:37:08.325 --> 01:37:09.525]  This is what it is.
[01:37:09.525 --> 01:37:15.550]  And just like George Soros actually rounded up Jews, but he's loved because he's a Jew that rounded up Jews.
[01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:16.511]  It's sick!
[01:37:16.511 --> 01:37:18.993]  So they point at Ye and say he's the ultimate Nazi.
[01:37:18.993 --> 01:37:20.915]  I think his point was to call all this out.
[01:37:20.915 --> 01:37:23.197]  What do you make of this, Hotep?
[01:37:23.197 --> 01:37:24.218]  Reminds me of World War II.
[01:37:25.589 --> 01:37:34.151]  When you had corporations like Standard Oil giving out the hydrogenation process to the Nazis.
[01:37:34.151 --> 01:37:36.792]  You had Wall Street backing the Nazis.
[01:37:36.792 --> 01:37:38.072]  So what do we have in a day?
[01:37:38.072 --> 01:37:42.673]  We have the same money guys controlling communism.
[01:37:42.673 --> 01:37:44.214]  Right?
[01:37:44.214 --> 01:37:49.915]  Because Germany dealt with socialist uprising, communist uprising, just like Russia did.
[01:37:49.915 --> 01:37:53.236]  So this is the same playbook, same game plan.
[01:37:53.846 --> 01:37:56.948]  And what they do is these money manipulators use communism.
[01:37:56.948 --> 01:38:02.532]  And now the communists, what they're saying is, you got to support the war in Ukraine.
[01:38:02.532 --> 01:38:08.255]  Everybody's rocking the yellow and blue flag, and that's the consensus.
[01:38:08.255 --> 01:38:09.056]  Support Ukraine.
[01:38:09.056 --> 01:38:10.517]  If you don't, you're a bad person.
[01:38:11.630 --> 01:38:12.390]  Forget the point.
[01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:14.531]  Just completely ignore those Nazis.
[01:38:14.531 --> 01:38:17.313]  Be mad at Ye, who's not an actual Nazi.
[01:38:17.313 --> 01:38:19.254]  But these Nazis over here?
[01:38:19.254 --> 01:38:21.015]  Oh, let's send them javelins.
[01:38:21.015 --> 01:38:22.555]  Let's send them money.
[01:38:22.555 --> 01:38:26.858]  Let's send them war material.
[01:38:26.858 --> 01:38:29.219]  That is the common consensus now.
[01:38:29.219 --> 01:38:31.560]  And this is what Elon
[01:38:32.339 --> 01:38:33.960]  is subject to.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:39.824]  Elon has to follow the mainstream narrative to a certain extent.
[01:38:39.824 --> 01:38:44.207]  At some point he can deviate but he knows where that line is drawn.
[01:38:44.207 --> 01:38:48.971]  See right now we have the Azov battalion still exists on Twitter.
[01:38:48.971 --> 01:38:50.051]  They want to completely ignore it.
[01:38:50.051 --> 01:38:58.457]  If you go look at the previous publishing by mainstream media before the war started many years ago they say there is a Nazi presence in Ukraine.
[01:38:58.457 --> 01:38:59.678]  So what's the long game here?
[01:39:00.498 --> 01:39:07.385]  Well, the long game here is they're going to arm them, just like they armed the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, all these different organizations.
[01:39:07.385 --> 01:39:09.468]  They're going to arm them.
[01:39:09.468 --> 01:39:10.489]  War to end.
[01:39:10.489 --> 01:39:15.414]  And then a few years later, they're going to come back and say, oh, man, there's Nazis in Ukraine.
[01:39:15.414 --> 01:39:16.935]  We have to go back in Ukraine.
[01:39:16.935 --> 01:39:18.297]  We have to get rid of the Nazis.
[01:39:18.297 --> 01:39:19.939]  This is the long term game plan.
[01:39:19.939 --> 01:39:20.479]  Exactly.
[01:39:20.479 --> 01:39:21.180]  That's what's going to happen.
[01:39:22.615 --> 01:39:31.880]  And then we'll be back in that war and everybody... And then what they'll do is they'll even ignore the fact that everybody warned them and said, you know, we're arming Nazis, you know, there's Nazis.
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:33.501]  Everybody's gonna act like we didn't know this.
[01:39:33.501 --> 01:39:35.362]  Everybody's gonna act like this wasn't said.
[01:39:35.362 --> 01:39:40.724]  And then they're gonna make everybody support a war in Ukraine that's anti-Nazi.
[01:39:40.724 --> 01:39:46.007]  And then you recycle, rinse and repeat and turn this into a new land for some other people.
[01:39:46.551 --> 01:39:47.272]  I agree.
[01:39:47.272 --> 01:39:49.673]  So what do you make of yesterday?
[01:39:49.673 --> 01:39:51.175]  Cruise missiles fired out of Ukraine.
[01:39:51.175 --> 01:39:56.278]  They now admitted attacking Russian military bases 100 plus miles inside Russia.
[01:39:56.278 --> 01:39:57.299]  A major escalation.
[01:39:57.299 --> 01:39:58.060]  Let's roll it with audio.
[01:39:58.060 --> 01:40:02.423]  Here it is.
[01:40:02.423 --> 01:40:05.586]  Missile flies over.
[01:40:05.586 --> 01:40:06.646]  You see the explosion.
[01:40:06.646 --> 01:40:09.308]  And then seconds later, the sound comes back.
[01:40:09.308 --> 01:40:10.829]  Boom.
[01:40:10.829 --> 01:40:12.591]  See the explosion.
[01:40:12.591 --> 01:40:14.012]  And then now here comes the sound.
[01:40:20.353 --> 01:40:25.194]  So, now our media is cheerleading Ukraine firing missiles deep into Russia.
[01:40:25.194 --> 01:40:29.495]  Why is this not a good idea, or maybe it is a good idea, Otep?
[01:40:29.495 --> 01:40:32.675]  Um, you know, I couldn't answer that question.
[01:40:32.675 --> 01:40:34.355]  I'm not exactly sure.
[01:40:34.355 --> 01:40:38.356]  What I can say is Ukraine can do no wrong.
[01:40:38.356 --> 01:40:43.017]  The media who controls the general narrative is going to spin things however they want to see it.
[01:40:43.017 --> 01:40:47.198]  They spun the last two years into being something that it wasn't.
[01:40:47.198 --> 01:40:48.958]  It turned out people died suddenly.
[01:40:49.845 --> 01:40:56.252]  Um, Ukraine can, for example, when we dealt with, uh, what was the name, Nord Stream Pipeline, right?
[01:40:56.252 --> 01:41:02.438]  You know, your one hand you got Biden saying, hey, yeah, we can shut this thing down whenever we want.
[01:41:02.438 --> 01:41:06.962]  And then the thing gets shut down and everybody's like, oh no, Putin did it, right?
[01:41:06.962 --> 01:41:10.005]  So it depends on who controls the megaphone.
[01:41:10.005 --> 01:41:12.288]  And that is the narrative you got to go along with.
[01:41:12.288 --> 01:41:13.469]  What I suggest people do is
[01:41:14.469 --> 01:41:17.071]  Study history, because all these things have parallels.
[01:41:17.071 --> 01:41:19.653]  All these things are like reruns.
[01:41:19.653 --> 01:41:21.434]  And then make the decision up to yourself.
[01:41:21.434 --> 01:41:24.256]  But if the media says go left, you probably want to go right.
[01:41:24.256 --> 01:41:27.759]  And if they say go right, you probably want to go left.
[01:41:27.759 --> 01:41:28.199]  I agree.
[01:41:28.199 --> 01:41:30.240]  So let me ask you, the last segment's coming up.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.001]  We got some time left.
[01:41:32.001 --> 01:41:33.202]  What about culture in general?
[01:41:33.202 --> 01:41:34.023]  Are you hopeful?
[01:41:34.023 --> 01:41:35.864]  Are you white-pilled?
[01:41:35.864 --> 01:41:36.765]  Are you black-pilled?
[01:41:36.765 --> 01:41:37.625]  Are you red-pilled?
[01:41:37.625 --> 01:41:38.866]  I mean, where are you on this?
[01:41:38.866 --> 01:41:39.587]  I'm white-pilled.
[01:41:40.379 --> 01:41:42.440]  I'm white pilled.
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:45.582]  You know, these people are sloppy.
[01:41:45.582 --> 01:41:47.663]  Look at the whole Hunter Biden situation.
[01:41:47.663 --> 01:41:50.064]  They couldn't keep that under wraps.
[01:41:50.064 --> 01:41:51.245]  Look at the last two years.
[01:41:51.245 --> 01:41:52.605]  They couldn't keep that under wraps.
[01:41:52.605 --> 01:41:58.628]  They couldn't keep the WikiLeaks situation with Hillary under wraps.
[01:41:58.628 --> 01:42:00.229]  They're sloppy.
[01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:07.613]  Also, if you look at the last two years, that massive push to push an agenda extremely fast and accelerated.
[01:42:08.670 --> 01:42:10.651]  To me was a signal of panic.
[01:42:10.651 --> 01:42:12.932]  I had to accelerate their control.
[01:42:12.932 --> 01:42:16.133]  So that's why I'm white pilled because what I don't see are people who are in control.
[01:42:16.133 --> 01:42:22.196]  What I see are people who are trying to make sure they maintain control or increase their control.
[01:42:22.196 --> 01:42:27.078]  But the last two years were so sloppy and done at such an accelerated rate.
[01:42:27.078 --> 01:42:29.139]  It proves that they're in panic mode.
[01:42:29.139 --> 01:42:33.060]  I suggest everybody else out there be extremely white pilled.
[01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:33.801]  We will win.
[01:42:33.801 --> 01:42:36.982]  We are winning every single day and there's nothing they can do to stop us.
[01:42:37.202 --> 01:42:37.963]  I agree with you.
[01:42:37.963 --> 01:42:43.731]  In fact, I'm going to take this last-minute clip, guys, when we post this interview at Man Up Video, of Hotep right there about he's white-billed.
[01:42:43.731 --> 01:42:44.672]  I want that up front.
[01:42:44.672 --> 01:42:49.618]  Except, there's a bad side to this, and I'll explain when we come back.
[01:42:49.618 --> 01:42:53.303]  What about, I'm going to introduce a term, dead-billed.
[01:42:53.303 --> 01:42:54.364]  Talk about dead-billed.
[01:42:54.364 --> 01:42:54.805]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:59.167 --> 01:43:06.153]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[01:43:06.153 --> 01:43:11.337]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[01:43:11.337 --> 01:43:18.362]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[01:43:18.362 --> 01:43:21.545]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.
[01:43:22.425 --> 01:43:26.587]  And you can do that now at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:43:26.587 --> 01:43:30.208]  Help us clear out our stock of bodies tumor.
[01:43:30.208 --> 01:43:33.029]  Vitamin C with zinc and alpha power.
[01:43:33.029 --> 01:43:40.452]  Turn those shady Federal Reserve notes into the highest quality supplements available while they still last.
[01:43:40.452 --> 01:43:43.673]  Now with free shipping.
[01:43:43.673 --> 01:43:49.936]  We thank you for your support and we wish you a very peaceful, happy and Merry Christmas.
[01:43:58.396 --> 01:44:06.961]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[01:44:06.961 --> 01:44:16.606]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day.
[01:44:16.606 --> 01:44:18.267]  And that's the problem.
[01:44:18.267 --> 01:44:21.028]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[01:44:21.028 --> 01:44:23.810]  They illegally changed state elections.
[01:44:24.690 --> 01:44:30.232]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[01:44:30.232 --> 01:44:32.253]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[01:44:32.253 --> 01:44:36.514]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[01:44:36.514 --> 01:44:51.620]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity, and question the fact that elections
[01:44:52.381 --> 01:44:54.483]  Um, shouldn't be run the way they are.
[01:44:54.483 --> 01:44:59.969]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[01:44:59.969 --> 01:45:04.875]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalists.
[01:45:04.875 --> 01:45:10.462]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[01:45:11.258 --> 01:45:16.380]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:18.101]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[01:45:18.101 --> 01:45:19.381]  Yes, I've persevered.
[01:45:19.381 --> 01:45:25.244]  But the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we've had this success.
[01:45:25.244 --> 01:45:30.106]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had.
[01:45:30.666 --> 01:45:44.212]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[01:45:44.212 --> 01:45:45.572]  God bless you all.
[01:45:45.572 --> 01:45:46.613]  I salute you.
[01:45:46.613 --> 01:45:53.775]  I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this streak is happening.
[01:45:53.775 --> 01:45:55.076]  The fight is my fight.
[01:45:55.076 --> 01:45:55.696]  It's your fight.
[01:45:55.696 --> 01:45:56.437]  It's our fight.
[01:45:56.437 --> 01:45:57.237]  God bless you all.
[01:45:58.843 --> 01:46:01.084]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[01:46:01.084 --> 01:46:05.087]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.
[01:46:05.087 --> 01:46:06.407]  There's a solution.
[01:46:06.407 --> 01:46:07.408]  The Wellness Company.
[01:46:07.408 --> 01:46:10.710]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[01:46:10.710 --> 01:46:17.914]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[01:46:18.174 --> 01:46:44.233]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[01:46:45.328 --> 01:46:45.829]  I think so.
[01:47:19.387 --> 01:47:38.774]  Alright, what is deadpill?
[01:47:38.774 --> 01:47:40.775]  The word I just, the term I just invented.
[01:47:42.122 --> 01:47:45.003]  Well, you got white-pilled, where you've got a good vision of the future.
[01:47:45.003 --> 01:47:46.963]  Black-pilled, where you've given up, you think everything's over.
[01:47:46.963 --> 01:47:49.304]  Red-pilled means you're awake to what's going on.
[01:47:49.304 --> 01:47:53.924]  They kind of say, once you become red-pilled, are you going to be black-pilled or white-pilled?
[01:47:53.924 --> 01:47:56.285]  And I'm overall white-pilled.
[01:47:56.285 --> 01:48:03.787]  But that's if people keep waking up and keep standing up, and if we can get the establishment to realize how crazy they are, as well, and back off.
[01:48:03.787 --> 01:48:05.407]  Because they're going to keep doubling down.
[01:48:06.806 --> 01:48:09.828]  With their move for control of power and keep destabilizing.
[01:48:09.828 --> 01:48:14.470]  So the more they lose, the more radical and dangerous they get.
[01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:21.394]  And so if we have a nuclear war and it kills half the population of the world, we go back to another dark age or kills everybody.
[01:48:21.394 --> 01:48:23.114]  That's extinction pilled.
[01:48:23.114 --> 01:48:23.935]  That's black pilled.
[01:48:23.935 --> 01:48:25.356]  So, Hotef, I agree with you.
[01:48:25.356 --> 01:48:27.797]  I'm overall white pilled currently about the state of the awakening.
[01:48:28.797 --> 01:48:30.378]  That's going to work against them.
[01:48:30.378 --> 01:48:33.179]  That is absolutely going to work against them.
[01:48:33.179 --> 01:48:42.043]  So, for example, when I speak about black folks, you know, the one thing I say is it's easy to organize a small amount of people than it is a large amount of people.
[01:48:59.151 --> 01:49:06.419]  And, um, there's a lot of black people on this planet when you consider the diaspora in Africa, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:49:06.419 --> 01:49:11.864]  So therefore it's really hard to organize even on the African continent because there's so many different views.
[01:49:11.864 --> 01:49:18.111]  If they were to reduce the population of the United States or the world, it's going to work against them.
[01:49:18.746 --> 01:49:22.227]  And in fact, this is like the whole Thanos Theory, right?
[01:49:22.227 --> 01:49:24.427]  Like, you reduce the population and things get better.
[01:49:24.427 --> 01:49:25.727]  That's actually what'll happen.
[01:49:25.727 --> 01:49:29.008]  Like, if they reduce the population, things will get better.
[01:49:29.008 --> 01:49:46.932]  In fact, I always said, in order for people to really get red-pilled, you're gonna need to cut off their... So, for example, in the United States, we have this, what do you call it, standard of living, this high standard of living.
[01:49:46.932 --> 01:49:47.812]  Once that's threatened,
[01:49:48.806 --> 01:49:51.348]  Oh, you can expect a lot of people to be red pill.
[01:49:51.348 --> 01:49:58.134]  Once that TV stops working, you know, once the supermarket isn't stopped, you're going to have people start to organize.
[01:49:58.134 --> 01:50:01.437]  Like what's the thing that stops people from being organized right now?
[01:50:01.437 --> 01:50:04.279]  Isn't it media, sports and entertainment?
[01:50:04.279 --> 01:50:10.264]  So if the NFL stops and NBA stops, et cetera, et cetera, people have no choice but to start organizing.
[01:50:10.848 --> 01:50:18.776]  What the people with these big organizations, the three-letter agencies, etc, etc, have over us is that they're organized and the people are unorganized.
[01:50:18.776 --> 01:50:25.722]  So if they try to reduce the population, all they'll do is they'll push us towards, um, towards organization.
[01:50:25.722 --> 01:50:28.465]  So instead what they do is they try to chop their heads off the snake.
[01:50:28.465 --> 01:50:31.908]  They try to chop the head, like for example, yay, Alex Jones.
[01:50:31.908 --> 01:50:34.991]  These are the heads of the snake and they want to chop their heads off.
[01:50:35.603 --> 01:50:40.447]  You are 100% right, because a lot of their attacks are counterintuitive.
[01:50:40.447 --> 01:50:45.170]  They want to dumb down mass disturbance, but they need us to operate even robots that are going to replace us.
[01:50:45.170 --> 01:50:51.375]  But then they also have these dumbed down, decadent masses that are totally brainwashed and worthless for them.
[01:50:51.375 --> 01:51:03.924]  And we know that the Black Plague killed half the population of Europe and caused the Renaissance after that, because it shook up the establishment, knocked out the elites, and made human labor more valuable, but also made the survivors get together and be more hardcore.
[01:51:05.234 --> 01:51:05.795]  Absolutely.
[01:51:05.795 --> 01:51:09.138]  I mean, look at my brand, for example.
[01:51:09.138 --> 01:51:18.947]  You know, if it wasn't for the bosses that deal with me, Gutfeld, Alex, Tim Pool, Rogan, if it wasn't for you guys, nobody would know who I am.
[01:51:18.947 --> 01:51:21.790]  I'm severely de-boosted on Instagram.
[01:51:21.790 --> 01:51:24.312]  Facebook has banned me from advertising.
[01:51:24.312 --> 01:51:26.014]  I can't even give Facebook money.
[01:51:26.474 --> 01:51:30.696]  And the funny thing is, I don't use Facebook, so I don't even know why I'm banned.
[01:51:30.696 --> 01:51:34.077]  But they said I broke some rule, but I'm like, I don't use your platform, how am I banned?
[01:51:34.077 --> 01:51:38.379]  So obviously somebody up there didn't like who I am, and then shut off my account.
[01:51:38.379 --> 01:51:40.620]  So I can't even boost posts there.
[01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:43.781]  Well yeah, but they're also banning people talking about you, so that's what that ban means.
[01:51:45.014 --> 01:51:47.355]  Well yeah, absolutely.
[01:51:47.355 --> 01:51:52.438]  So they're not just censoring you, they're censoring other people's opinions by the millions of you.
[01:51:52.438 --> 01:51:53.578]  So let's do this.
[01:51:53.578 --> 01:51:57.661]  Who I really feel sorry for is I see what they've done to all the impoverished communities.
[01:51:57.661 --> 01:52:01.202]  We know the black community, they admit it's a model of what they're doing to everybody else.
[01:52:01.202 --> 01:52:05.825]  I love seeing black folks break free because that's the real canary in the coal mine and I love everybody.
[01:52:06.365 --> 01:52:10.167]  Because I understand if we don't all win together, we're going to fall together, as Benjamin Franklin said.
[01:52:10.167 --> 01:52:19.672]  But this whole movement of be obese, be unhealthy, commit suicide, be as nihilistic as possible, why would the system push that on a population?
[01:52:19.672 --> 01:52:25.516]  Because all it's going to do is create another group that sees it and gets more hardcore, as you said, and then wipe out their own supporters.
[01:52:25.516 --> 01:52:28.978]  Here's a few of these clips of just the most saddening mind control ever.
[01:52:28.978 --> 01:52:29.338]  Here it is.
[01:52:30.253 --> 01:52:35.284]  Just a reminder that I am very fat and very sexy.
[01:52:35.284 --> 01:52:37.168]  And I am 100% glorifying obesity.
[01:52:41.977 --> 01:52:46.438]  Hi, you are not body positive if you are not anti-racist.
[01:52:46.438 --> 01:52:50.959]  You can't be body positive if you're not anti-racist.
[01:52:50.959 --> 01:53:04.062]  If you want to engage in, and benefit from, and profit off of this space, and you want it to just be about loving your roles, and cellulite, and stretch marks, you are at the tip of the iceberg, and you've missed the entire point.
[01:53:04.062 --> 01:53:09.123]  Body positivity is meant for us to get at the root of the bullshit that we have been taught, and guess what?
[01:53:10.183 --> 01:53:13.164]  Fatphobia is very much rooted in racism.
[01:53:13.164 --> 01:53:13.905]  Like, big time.
[01:53:13.905 --> 01:53:15.285]  Like, seriously.
[01:53:15.285 --> 01:53:19.087]  Also, black women totally paved the way for us in this space here.
[01:53:19.087 --> 01:53:24.409]  So, if you care about this stuff, now is not the time to be silent, okay?
[01:53:24.409 --> 01:53:28.530]  This is not just about you learning to love your body.
[01:53:28.530 --> 01:53:35.613]  This is about all of us dismantling systems that make it impossible for people to just be safe in their bodies.
[01:53:35.613 --> 01:53:37.894]  And that means following up with action.
[01:53:38.214 --> 01:53:40.298]  Okay, so let me analyze that and get your take on it.
[01:53:40.298 --> 01:53:44.326]  I'm a little overweight because I'm a big stocky guy, but I work out and, you know, I've had my heart checked.
[01:53:44.326 --> 01:53:47.332]  I actually have low blood pressure for my age.
[01:53:47.332 --> 01:53:47.873]  I'm doing good.
[01:53:48.999 --> 01:53:50.700]  But, I could be better.
[01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:59.262]  But to say, body positivity, if she needs to be healthier, people say, hey, weighing 400 pounds, 500 pounds, when you're 5'4", it's not healthy.
[01:53:59.262 --> 01:54:01.323]  She's saying, no, you're being racist to me.
[01:54:01.323 --> 01:54:02.924]  Why is the system promoting it?
[01:54:02.924 --> 01:54:08.345]  And you see these slaves, to their unhealthiness, literally celebrating their slavery.
[01:54:08.345 --> 01:54:11.226]  This is the mind control for me, Hotep.
[01:54:11.226 --> 01:54:12.747]  It's definitely mind control.
[01:54:12.747 --> 01:54:15.588]  In fact, what it is, is it's homogeneity of the mind.
[01:54:16.387 --> 01:54:19.612]  Um, getting people to all think alike.
[01:54:19.612 --> 01:54:29.445]  You see, once everybody thinks alike, then you only have to intercept one group of people with your programming and control and everybody goes along with the mass and the jab and it spreads, etc, etc.
[01:54:29.445 --> 01:54:33.170]  But when you have many different types of groups who think many different things.
[01:54:34.571 --> 01:54:41.213]  At that point, it's much harder to control because now you have to infect thousands of different groups, thousands of different organizations.
[01:54:41.213 --> 01:54:48.016]  But if what they can do is if they can cloud the conversation, for example, if they can say, there's no longer such thing as racism.
[01:54:48.016 --> 01:54:50.096]  In fact, fat phobia is racism.
[01:54:50.096 --> 01:54:54.038]  And if you don't like fat people, then you're also transphobic.
[01:54:54.038 --> 01:54:56.899]  And if you don't like trans people, then you don't like black people.
[01:54:56.899 --> 01:55:01.080]  So what they're trying to do is they're trying to lump everything all into the same ideology
[01:55:01.852 --> 01:55:09.760]  To create that homogeneity and group everyone together, you know, the whole victim narrative, victim Olympics, etc, etc.
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:16.948]  Now, the next part of the next part of this is communists need the minority to exploit.
[01:55:17.446 --> 01:55:26.592]  They take a look at groups that are underserved, underrepresentative, and they exploit their problems, and then they weaponize them against other groups of people.
[01:55:26.592 --> 01:55:32.837]  Notice that this fat woman isn't upset at McDonald's for making her fat.
[01:55:33.377 --> 01:55:36.479]  She's mad at us because we don't want to date her.
[01:55:36.479 --> 01:55:40.422]  If you flash back a hundred years, nobody existed with this type of size.
[01:55:40.422 --> 01:55:46.366]  Now you look around and everybody exists like this because of the emergence of synthetic foods.
[01:55:46.366 --> 01:55:49.228]  And people say, oh, the FDA approved this and that.
[01:55:49.228 --> 01:55:56.873]  Well, the FDA also approves many synthetic foods, fake foods, that other countries would not even take a second thought about.
[01:55:57.093 --> 01:55:58.915]  Yes, but you gotta add the part about the homogenous mind.
[01:55:58.915 --> 01:56:02.058]  See, depopulation doesn't work unless everybody thinks the same, and unless everybody is a victim.
[01:56:18.624 --> 01:56:20.386]  They don't want people to feel empowered.
[01:56:20.386 --> 01:56:21.967]  They want people to feel victim.
[01:56:21.967 --> 01:56:22.447]  Why?
[01:56:22.447 --> 01:56:25.891]  So that the Bolsheviks can then be their hero.
[01:56:25.891 --> 01:56:27.332]  And then they look to somebody else.
[01:56:27.332 --> 01:56:28.293]  They look outwards.
[01:56:28.293 --> 01:56:30.835]  People in the self-help area always talk about this.
[01:56:30.835 --> 01:56:32.757]  Do you gonna take empowerment of your own life?
[01:56:32.757 --> 01:56:34.218]  You gonna blame your problems on somebody else?
[01:56:34.438 --> 01:56:36.321]  Fear somebody taking power of their lives.
[01:56:36.321 --> 01:56:39.846]  They're telling them every affliction we've got that we should try to get out of.
[01:56:39.846 --> 01:56:40.567]  No, no, no.
[01:56:40.567 --> 01:56:41.528]  Celebrate it.
[01:56:41.528 --> 01:56:42.670]  Get another 50 pounds.
[01:56:42.670 --> 01:56:44.031]  This is pure evil.
[01:56:44.031 --> 01:56:45.093]  Hotep, you're a genius.
[01:56:45.093 --> 01:56:46.775]  HotepJesus.com.
[01:56:46.775 --> 01:56:47.917]  Really appreciate you.
[01:56:47.917 --> 01:56:49.078]  Join us on a regular basis.
[01:56:49.078 --> 01:56:49.459]  We love you.
[01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:52.290]  Hey, I appreciate you, man.
[01:56:52.290 --> 01:56:53.411]  It's a lot of love.
[01:56:53.411 --> 01:56:55.592]  It's a dream come true to come on this channel.
[01:56:55.592 --> 01:56:58.753]  Been following you since my 20s.
[01:56:58.753 --> 01:57:02.856]  And, you know, you do amazing work and I appreciate you.
[01:57:02.856 --> 01:57:18.244]  But that's the thing, you know, people have to, if you really want to understand what happens in this country or what's happening in this country, you have to go look at the end of the 19th century and the Bolshevik Revolution and how they exploit minority groups and get money from Wall Street.
[01:57:18.584 --> 01:57:20.905]  You study that stuff, all this stuff will start to make sense.
[01:57:20.905 --> 01:57:21.185]  That's right.
[01:57:21.185 --> 01:57:26.926]  The biggest, most corrupt money is funding all the wokeism, not to empower people, but to enslave us.
[01:57:26.926 --> 01:57:29.086]  Ho-Tep, thank you so much.
[01:57:29.086 --> 01:57:30.287]  Hey, I appreciate you, man.
[01:57:30.287 --> 01:57:31.647]  Ho-Tep and Bill.
[01:57:31.647 --> 01:57:37.508]  We got a big third hour with Robert Barnes and a ton of news we're going to hit coming up.
[01:57:37.508 --> 01:57:38.588]  Infowars.com.
[01:57:38.588 --> 01:57:40.509]  Tomorrow's news today, banned-out video.
[01:57:40.509 --> 01:57:45.030]  It's a revolutionary act to share those links in your email and text messages and in person.
[01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.570]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:58.225]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:57:58.225 --> 01:58:02.067]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[01:58:02.067 --> 01:58:11.132]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company and they're able to cut our regular shipping costs by up to 50%.
[01:58:11.132 --> 01:58:13.173]  So that means even on orders that are below $50,
[01:58:13.933 --> 01:58:17.376]  You're going to be paying way lower than you were previously.
[01:58:17.376 --> 01:58:18.837]  This is a game changer.
[01:58:18.837 --> 01:58:20.379]  We're so excited about it.
[01:58:20.379 --> 01:58:22.621]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[01:58:22.621 --> 01:58:27.064]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[01:58:27.064 --> 01:58:30.187]  So now, your orders will be shipped even faster.
[01:58:30.187 --> 01:58:32.629]  The same great customer service and more.
[01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:38.354]  So, get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[01:58:39.275 --> 01:58:46.862]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system, lead a healthier life, and keep Inflores on the air at InfloresStore.com.
[01:58:49.662 --> 01:58:56.646]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[01:58:56.646 --> 01:59:01.829]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[01:59:01.829 --> 01:59:08.753]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[01:59:08.753 --> 01:59:12.055]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.
[01:59:12.935 --> 01:59:17.076]  And you can do that now at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:59:17.076 --> 01:59:20.717]  Help us clear out our stock of body's tumourite.
[01:59:20.717 --> 01:59:23.558]  Vitamin C with zinc and alpha power.
[01:59:23.558 --> 01:59:30.960]  Turn those shady Federal Reserve notes into the highest quality supplements available while they still last.
[01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:34.180]  Now with free shipping.
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:36.461]  We thank you for your support.
[01:59:36.461 --> 01:59:40.442]  And we wish you a very peaceful, happy and Merry Christmas.
[01:59:52.523 --> 02:00:10.091]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:10.091 --> 02:00:14.153]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:14.153 --> 02:00:15.634]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.210 --> 02:00:30.875]  All right, Robert Barnes is coming up in the next segment to cover all the big controversies, all the huge news.
[02:00:30.875 --> 02:00:32.596]  You don't want to miss that information.
[02:00:32.596 --> 02:00:33.637]  But I wanted to hit this.
[02:00:33.637 --> 02:00:39.321]  I covered this last night, but two or three times more people tune in to the weekday shows than the Sunday show.
[02:00:39.321 --> 02:00:41.562]  I want everybody to hear this.
[02:00:41.562 --> 02:00:51.409]  There's a bunch of articles on Infowars.com from Israel, Japan, England, you name it, the UK, Germany, Canada, admitting government officials in government meetings.
[02:00:52.566 --> 02:00:53.126]  That is so huge.
[02:00:53.126 --> 02:00:54.187]  And it needs to get out there.
[02:00:54.187 --> 02:00:56.008]  So I want to play this clip again of the top
[02:01:11.633 --> 02:01:18.135]  Professor, they're at Kyoto University in a government meeting with the head of the vaccine program saying, you've covered things up.
[02:01:18.135 --> 02:01:25.438]  Disease expert blasts Japan's Ministry of Health, says halt vaccine campaign, investigate all VAX injuries.
[02:01:25.438 --> 02:01:28.159]  Then we've got the same thing coming out in Israel.
[02:01:28.159 --> 02:01:31.600]  The government covered up the damage, put out fake reports that it was safe.
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:34.061]  Incredible information.
[02:01:34.061 --> 02:01:38.423]  This is huge, huge, huge, huge.
[02:01:40.939 --> 02:01:44.704]  And it just begs the question, how did they think they'd get away with something like this?
[02:01:44.704 --> 02:01:46.307]  Because they're not.
[02:01:46.307 --> 02:01:50.973]  Rand Paul last week called for the arrest of Fauci, said we're gonna get you, we know you created the virus.
[02:01:50.973 --> 02:01:53.918]  Now they have a major Wuhan lab whistleblower coming out saying we made it.
[02:01:54.915 --> 02:01:56.516]  The New York Post with almost no coverage.
[02:01:56.516 --> 02:01:58.117]  I mean, they really did it.
[02:01:58.117 --> 02:01:59.418]  And I know that's hard for you to believe.
[02:01:59.418 --> 02:02:00.298]  It's hard for me to believe.
[02:02:00.298 --> 02:02:02.379]  Because it's so dangerous.
[02:02:02.379 --> 02:02:03.820]  It's so crazy.
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:07.582]  But Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab say they want to depopulate you.
[02:02:07.582 --> 02:02:09.603]  So they're following through.
[02:02:09.603 --> 02:02:12.405]  Like Jeffrey Dahmer couldn't help but kidnap and kill people.
[02:02:12.405 --> 02:02:13.486]  Child molesters can't help it.
[02:02:13.486 --> 02:02:14.286]  They're mass killers.
[02:02:14.286 --> 02:02:15.527]  They can't help it.
[02:02:15.527 --> 02:02:17.368]  Here's the incredible Japanese government meeting.
[02:02:18.007 --> 02:02:21.369]  So I am telling you, you got to conduct an investigation.
[02:02:21.369 --> 02:02:25.750]  No doctor can make a medical diagnosis simply by looking at such a piece of paper.
[02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:30.132]  I'm saying that you must look at the medical reports and do a proper investigation.
[02:02:30.132 --> 02:02:31.833]  There's no question about it.
[02:02:31.833 --> 02:02:34.434]  Stop the bad science and do the right science.
[02:02:34.434 --> 02:02:35.235]  That's enough.
[02:02:35.235 --> 02:02:37.416]  Looks like you're trying to destroy evidence.
[02:02:37.416 --> 02:02:40.677]  Do the right thing or you're just going to have a criminal lawsuit.
[02:02:40.677 --> 02:02:43.638]  Enough is enough.
[02:02:43.638 --> 02:02:44.819]  I don't care what you say.
[02:02:45.999 --> 02:02:50.682]  No one is going to be convinced by the process or bull**** things that you are talking about.
[02:02:50.682 --> 02:02:55.144]  Well, of course, we will not only evaluate the results as they are.
[02:02:55.144 --> 02:02:56.165]  We are trying.
[02:02:56.165 --> 02:02:59.647]  You can't possibly have any way to evaluate it.
[02:02:59.647 --> 02:03:07.791]  What you need, clinically speaking, is that you need to look at the medical records properly, look at the data, and do it properly and carefully, one case at a time.
[02:03:08.872 --> 02:03:10.793]  People's lives are at stake.
[02:03:10.793 --> 02:03:11.333]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:11.333 --> 02:03:13.634]  We will make every effort to do so.
[02:03:13.634 --> 02:03:15.375]  You idiot!
[02:03:15.375 --> 02:03:16.436]  Enough is enough.
[02:03:16.436 --> 02:03:19.897]  You have so many people here, but you are not getting anywhere.
[02:03:19.897 --> 02:03:22.118]  Lawmakers also came all the way here.
[02:03:22.118 --> 02:03:24.159]  You can't repeat this kind of thing.
[02:03:24.159 --> 02:03:27.841]  You should have started from the beginning with the proper scientific light.
[02:03:27.841 --> 02:03:32.283]  So, immediately disband the ridiculous Vaccine Casualty Evaluation Committee.
[02:03:32.703 --> 02:03:36.806]  Instead, set up an investigation committee to investigate all cases.
[02:03:36.806 --> 02:03:41.450]  And to do so, you need to get proper statisticians and some decent experts.
[02:03:41.450 --> 02:03:42.591]  You understand?
[02:03:42.591 --> 02:03:50.237]  Then do some tests and investigations, as Dr. Sono said earlier, if you have samples of tissue, consider the process of spiked protein.
[02:03:51.263 --> 02:03:54.184]  People are already doing research all over the world.
[02:03:54.184 --> 02:03:56.404]  Japan's prestige is at stake.
[02:03:56.404 --> 02:03:58.665]  You have vaccinated so many people.
[02:03:58.665 --> 02:04:05.826]  And yet, only 10% of the members of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare who are leading the vaccine campaign have been vaccinated.
[02:04:05.826 --> 02:04:07.847]  What the f***ing joke is that?
[02:04:07.847 --> 02:04:09.967]  First of all, you need to clarify this.
[02:04:09.967 --> 02:04:13.188]  Immediately disband the Vaccine Casualty Evaluation Committee.
[02:04:13.328 --> 02:04:15.208]  And investigate all the cases.
[02:04:15.208 --> 02:04:19.490]  You must identify all deaths and unreported deaths in the investigation.
[02:04:19.490 --> 02:04:22.830]  Thousands and tens of thousands of lives are at stake.
[02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:23.991]  And one more thing.
[02:04:23.991 --> 02:04:27.692]  We don't have any idea of the long-term side effects of this vaccine.
[02:04:27.692 --> 02:04:32.893]  The nanoparticles taken into the body in large quantity unceasingly produced by proteins.
[02:04:32.893 --> 02:04:35.994]  People are still sick, still in bad physical condition.
[02:04:35.994 --> 02:04:39.074]  For some reason, suddenly people's blood pressure rises.
[02:04:39.074 --> 02:04:41.475]  For some reason, people suddenly get eczema.
[02:04:41.795 --> 02:04:44.438]  When we diagnose, we find spike protein.
[02:04:44.438 --> 02:04:47.081]  In the diagnosis is moving to the next phase.
[02:04:47.081 --> 02:04:51.066]  We need to stop vaccinating immediately and take care of the health of all cases.
[02:04:51.066 --> 02:04:53.529]  That's what the scientific paper also says.
[02:04:53.529 --> 02:04:55.992]  You bring in people who don't have a proper understanding.
[02:04:59.312 --> 02:05:08.974]  Christmas 2022 is almost here, and we have great products at InfoWarsTore.com that empower your body, your libido, your immune system, that just enrich your life.

[02:05:40.703 --> 02:05:41.104]  Thank you.
[02:06:10.177 --> 02:06:16.660]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:16.660 --> 02:06:36.907]  You know, I've said it probably 500 times in the last 20 years, but I think my job is done when what I'm talking about is passé.
[02:06:38.240 --> 02:06:40.623]  Meaning it's known by everybody to be true.
[02:06:40.623 --> 02:06:50.193]  And with a large part of the public around the world, not just here in the U.S., people know there's a new world order, a world government, a depopulation agenda, a biomedical tyranny.
[02:06:50.193 --> 02:06:53.417]  They know criminal elements have taken over the government and are censoring and surveilling the people.
[02:06:53.417 --> 02:06:55.699]  They know there's controlled government, human smuggling.
[02:06:55.699 --> 02:06:57.121]  I mean, it's all coming out.
[02:06:59.619 --> 02:07:10.509]  But I thought, going back decades ago, that once we exposed this, and then once they tried to actually launch their plans, because we had their own battle plans, people would rally even more and say no to it.
[02:07:10.509 --> 02:07:15.393]  But instead, this reality is so horrible.
[02:07:15.393 --> 02:07:20.758]  This reality is so shocking to people.
[02:07:20.758 --> 02:07:23.921]  That they just say, well, I'm going to tune out.
[02:07:23.921 --> 02:07:25.923]  I'm just going to forget this is going on.
[02:07:27.813 --> 02:07:33.717]  I covered this earlier in the show, but all over the world they're saying you can't farm, you can't have cows or sheep anymore.
[02:07:33.717 --> 02:07:38.800]  We're going to have climate lockdowns in major cities in Europe and the UK.
[02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:40.841]  They're doing it.
[02:07:40.841 --> 02:07:41.602]  Look at these headlines.
[02:07:41.602 --> 02:07:42.202]  It's official.
[02:07:42.202 --> 02:07:46.585]  France bans short-haul domestic flights in favor of train travel.
[02:07:46.585 --> 02:07:50.967]  Tells the general public you can't fly inside France anymore.
[02:07:50.967 --> 02:07:54.229]  You must take the train, but the elites can use private jets.
[02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.950]  It goes on.
[02:07:56.235 --> 02:07:57.176]  And on in the Netherlands.
[02:07:57.176 --> 02:07:58.637]  We'll play the video coming up.
[02:07:58.637 --> 02:07:59.237]  Shock video.
[02:07:59.237 --> 02:08:07.703]  Netherlands police use heavy machinery to overturn tractors and farmers inside as they are announcing that much of their farms will be shut down to quote, save the earth.
[02:08:07.703 --> 02:08:11.405]  Now farms are bad for the earth.
[02:08:11.405 --> 02:08:17.169]  Oxfordshire counselled in trial for climate lockdown starting a year from now.
[02:08:18.803 --> 02:08:20.144]  It goes on and on.
[02:08:20.144 --> 02:08:27.146]  This is a war against the general public, a war against prosperity, because the big central banks have unlimited money.
[02:08:27.146 --> 02:08:30.767]  They want you poor with no job to control you.
[02:08:30.767 --> 02:08:34.209]  Will we actually walk blindly into this?
[02:08:34.209 --> 02:08:35.689]  Robert Barnes joins us for the hour.
[02:08:35.689 --> 02:08:38.650]  Great constitutional lawyer, great historian, good friend of mine.
[02:08:38.650 --> 02:08:42.472]  Barnes Law, he hosts the Barnes Viva, popular podcast as well.
[02:08:43.706 --> 02:09:01.056]  Robert, there's so many dozens of topics I want to get into with you, and we hadn't talked before you came on, but obviously we'll talk about the Twitter files and how huge those are, and the yay controversy, and now Ukraine's firing missiles into Russia and attacking airbases 100 miles inside Russia.
[02:09:01.056 --> 02:09:03.838]  I mean, things are escalating at an insane level.
[02:09:03.838 --> 02:09:12.263]  You got Obama two days ago making fun of Biden, saying, well, we don't let old Uncle Joe actually run anything.
[02:09:13.047 --> 02:09:15.627]  I mean, it's just reaching twilight zone proportions.
[02:09:15.627 --> 02:09:21.969]  You've got Project Veritas confirming they're smuggling kidnapped kids as young as six for sex slaves.
[02:09:21.969 --> 02:09:24.869]  They followed them all the way here to Austin, interviewed the kids.
[02:09:24.869 --> 02:09:31.410]  I mean, it's just, how did evil get this powerful or this expressed?
[02:09:31.410 --> 02:09:32.410]  Or was it always there?
[02:09:32.410 --> 02:09:33.210]  We didn't know about it.
[02:09:33.210 --> 02:09:36.231]  Well, it was always there, but I think it clearly has gotten worse.
[02:09:36.231 --> 02:09:37.391]  We'll get your take on that.
[02:09:37.391 --> 02:09:41.032]  There's a lot of things I just threw out, but what's front and center for you?
[02:09:41.032 --> 02:09:41.992]  And what do you want to tackle first?
[02:09:43.291 --> 02:09:47.029]  Well, I think the goal of the government to control what we eat.
[02:09:48.014 --> 02:09:54.097]  Because right now, like you mentioned, what's happening in the Netherlands, they're taking over farms in the name of green energy.
[02:09:54.097 --> 02:09:59.620]  The UK is talking about not allowing certain fertilizers or other things to be used.
[02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:04.302]  It's going to undermine their indigenous organic farming.
[02:10:04.302 --> 02:10:14.988]  You contrast that to Putin in Russia, who spent a lot of money actually expanding their organic food, because they understand that if you control food and you control fuel, then you actually really control the world.
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:17.462]  Well, look at what's happening in Pennsylvania.
[02:10:17.462 --> 02:10:21.446]  You know, I represent Amos Miller, the Amish farmer, and the U.S.
[02:10:21.446 --> 02:10:32.578]  Department of Agriculture has taken, I mean, here's a situation where a guy face, you know, he currently, you know, in a week or so, is looking at jail, going to jail.
[02:10:32.578 --> 02:10:34.440]  A farmer going to jail for what exactly?
[02:10:35.044 --> 02:10:46.185]  Uh, going to jail without any conviction of any crime, without any accusation of any crime, without any jury verdict of any kind at any time, and he's in a position where he's facing that and potentially bankrupting
[02:10:46.852 --> 02:10:51.517]  Tell folks the story because that's why I set it up with the food, figuring you would go there.
[02:11:10.376 --> 02:11:11.737]  They are raiding Amish all over.
[02:11:11.737 --> 02:11:13.077]  This is particularly egregious.
[02:11:13.077 --> 02:11:16.318]  Selling milk and stuff to their neighbors and others.
[02:11:16.318 --> 02:11:18.459]  And just totally outrageous.
[02:11:18.459 --> 02:11:19.339]  It's not fentanyl.
[02:11:19.339 --> 02:11:20.480]  Nobody's dying.
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:21.320]  Nobody's complaining.
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:22.981]  But they're so scared.
[02:11:22.981 --> 02:11:28.463]  The corporations are so scared of independent farms and things because in the future this will be how we stop the globalists.
[02:11:29.721 --> 02:11:30.261]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:11:30.261 --> 02:11:32.262]  I mean, you look at how the USDA got started.
[02:11:32.262 --> 02:11:35.663]  They got started, you know, with Upton Sinclair's The Jungle and the rest.
[02:11:35.663 --> 02:11:36.804]  They were like the FDA.
[02:11:36.804 --> 02:11:40.965]  They were supposed to be a marketing agency, an advertising agency.
[02:11:40.965 --> 02:11:45.867]  In other words, they made sure the label on the product you got, they're all about informed consent.
[02:11:46.387 --> 02:11:49.910]  Making sure the label on the product you got matched the product you got.
[02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:50.751]  That's it!
[02:11:50.751 --> 02:11:53.854]  FDA is not a super-regulatory medical agency.
[02:11:53.854 --> 02:11:56.256]  Many of them aren't even qualified to do that.
[02:11:56.256 --> 02:11:56.576]  The U.S.
[02:11:56.576 --> 02:12:00.019]  Department of Agriculture is not a bunch of farmers.
[02:12:00.019 --> 02:12:02.602]  In fact, they have almost no farmers who work for them.
[02:12:02.602 --> 02:12:05.184]  They have people who have no idea what the farming world is like.
[02:12:05.184 --> 02:12:06.665]  They have zero clue.
[02:12:06.665 --> 02:12:10.709]  And yet here they are trying to, and what they're doing is they're using that power over the label.
[02:12:11.269 --> 02:12:17.791]  To now say, like the FDA, the USDA now wants to say, we control what goes into your body, you don't.
[02:12:17.791 --> 02:12:23.953]  Because in the case of Amos Miller, he makes food, he makes meat, the way his customers want him to make it.
[02:12:23.953 --> 02:12:27.915]  They don't want USDA inspected meat.
[02:12:27.915 --> 02:12:30.295]  They don't want chemical laced meat.
[02:12:30.295 --> 02:12:32.216]  They don't want big corporate laced meat.
[02:12:32.216 --> 02:12:35.477]  In fact, many of them, for health reasons, cannot eat that.
[02:12:35.477 --> 02:12:38.318]  They have to have what Amos Miller provides them.
[02:12:38.798 --> 02:12:40.779]  His customers love him.
[02:12:40.779 --> 02:12:45.740]  There's never been a customer complaint ever against Amos Miller.
[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:46.660]  And yet here the U.S.
[02:12:46.660 --> 02:12:49.281]  government is coming in trying to shut him down.
[02:12:49.281 --> 02:12:51.362]  Threatening to put him in jail.
[02:12:51.362 --> 02:12:53.302]  Threatening to bankrupt his farm.
[02:12:53.302 --> 02:12:54.102]  For what?
[02:12:54.102 --> 02:12:56.543]  For giving people what they actually want.
[02:12:57.003 --> 02:13:01.784]  Which is healthy food made the way the ordinary person wants it made.
[02:13:01.784 --> 02:13:03.945]  His customers want it made.
[02:13:03.945 --> 02:13:06.605]  They don't want the chemical-laced food.
[02:13:06.605 --> 02:13:08.506]  They don't want preservative-laced food.
[02:13:08.506 --> 02:13:13.627]  They want food made in the traditional way that Amish have been making it for centuries.
[02:13:13.627 --> 02:13:16.407]  And for that, that's why they're trying to shut them down.
[02:13:16.407 --> 02:13:23.109]  And their goal is to use this case in order to establish a precedent that says we, the U.S.
[02:13:23.109 --> 02:13:23.489]  government,
[02:13:24.331 --> 02:13:24.951]  We, the U.S.
[02:13:24.951 --> 02:13:29.493]  Department of Agriculture, we get to dictate what you can put into your own body.
[02:13:29.493 --> 02:13:33.175]  I mean, for example, they have taken the position at different times in this case, the U.S.
[02:13:33.175 --> 02:13:39.097]  Department of Agriculture, that they can control what you make for yourself, how you grow it for yourself.
[02:13:39.097 --> 02:13:47.621]  And then remember that story just a couple of weeks ago, where the Biden administration said, tell us if you have a home garden, what are you making in your home garden?
[02:13:47.621 --> 02:13:52.183]  The goal is ultimately to determine and dictate what you can put into your own body.
[02:13:52.483 --> 02:13:52.944]  I think so.
[02:14:01.773 --> 02:14:02.214]  Absolutely.
[02:14:02.214 --> 02:14:06.358]  Remember what the IRS said we've talked about before back in the Roosevelt administration?
[02:14:06.358 --> 02:14:14.105]  The IRS said people shouldn't be thankful for what we, shouldn't be mad at us for what we do take, they should be thankful for what we don't take.
[02:14:14.105 --> 02:14:20.411]  Because the FDR administration actually recommended taxing people for their own labor in their own home.
[02:14:20.411 --> 02:14:25.156]  If you make your own food, you should have to pay a tax on that, as if you got it at a restaurant.
[02:14:25.957 --> 02:14:29.640]  If you fix up your own house, you should pay a tax on that.
[02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:32.182]  That's where it's ultimately going.
[02:14:32.182 --> 02:14:34.144]  It's ultimately converting us into chattel.
[02:14:34.144 --> 02:14:37.568]  They control what goes into our body in terms of medicine.
[02:14:37.568 --> 02:14:40.150]  They control what goes into our body in terms of food.
[02:14:40.150 --> 02:14:43.974]  They get to tax us for just waking up in the morning.
[02:14:43.974 --> 02:14:47.257]  That's the ultimate objective because that ultimately makes us all
[02:14:48.157 --> 02:14:51.519]  Legally, the effect, effectively, chattel of the state.
[02:14:51.519 --> 02:14:56.923]  The state gets to tell us what's good for us and what's not, just like they want to do in the information space.
[02:14:56.923 --> 02:15:05.468]  That's why all this stuff that's coming out, it came out last week, the FBI was taking people off of social media and directing it.
[02:15:05.468 --> 02:15:13.833]  So who is the community out there in America that doesn't listen, that doesn't defer to the government for their education, their food, or their medicine?
[02:15:14.438 --> 02:15:19.623]  And is healthier than the average community and wealthier than the average community in America.
[02:15:19.623 --> 02:15:20.864]  It's the Amish.
[02:15:20.864 --> 02:15:21.966]  That's why they're going after you.
[02:15:21.966 --> 02:15:24.568]  They have basically almost no autism.
[02:15:24.568 --> 02:15:27.711]  In the 1950s autism was like maybe 1 out of 10 million.
[02:15:27.711 --> 02:15:28.332]  Now it's 1 out of 100.
[02:15:28.332 --> 02:15:30.394]  They don't even have autism.
[02:15:31.872 --> 02:15:40.640]  Yeah, I mean, by every measurement, they live longer, they live better, they live healthier, they have independent wealth like our founders wanted to have be the basis of our democracy.
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:47.185]  That's why they're going to always target the Amish first, because they don't want people to look at that and say, hey, I can live a healthier, wealthier life.
[02:15:47.185 --> 02:15:47.806]  That's right.
[02:15:47.806 --> 02:15:48.547]  MS-13 is good.
[02:15:48.547 --> 02:15:50.228]  The CHICOMs are good.
[02:15:50.228 --> 02:15:51.409]  Zelensky's good.
[02:15:51.409 --> 02:15:52.050]  Amish bad.
[02:15:52.050 --> 02:15:52.950]  Robert Barnes.
[02:15:52.950 --> 02:15:53.351]  Stay with us.
[02:15:53.351 --> 02:15:54.632]  We'll be right back and talk more about this.
[02:15:57.975 --> 02:16:09.462]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[02:16:09.462 --> 02:16:13.924]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[02:16:13.924 --> 02:16:17.886]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[02:16:17.886 --> 02:16:22.329]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[02:16:22.329 --> 02:16:23.390]  You see, the sun
[02:16:24.110 --> 02:16:24.450]  We're good
[02:16:50.534 --> 02:17:01.302]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[02:17:01.302 --> 02:17:04.064]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[02:17:04.064 --> 02:17:06.806]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[02:17:06.806 --> 02:17:08.087]  I'm going to do that right now.
[02:17:08.087 --> 02:17:12.009]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[02:17:12.009 --> 02:17:16.913]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[02:17:17.193 --> 02:17:23.357]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[02:17:23.357 --> 02:17:31.982]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[02:17:31.982 --> 02:17:37.685]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[02:17:37.685 --> 02:17:43.108]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[02:17:43.348 --> 02:17:45.833]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[02:17:45.833 --> 02:17:48.498]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[02:17:48.498 --> 02:17:50.001]  So go check out the store.
[02:17:50.001 --> 02:17:51.203]  Go support their store.
[02:17:51.203 --> 02:17:52.706]  Go support InfoWars.
[02:17:52.706 --> 02:17:54.068]  Leave a donation right now.
[02:17:54.068 --> 02:17:55.571]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[02:17:58.024 --> 02:18:18.656]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[02:18:19.156 --> 02:18:32.279]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[02:18:32.279 --> 02:18:41.121]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air.
[02:18:41.121 --> 02:18:47.542]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[02:18:47.662 --> 02:18:49.083]  So continue to do it.
[02:18:49.083 --> 02:18:51.264]  Go to places like InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:18:51.264 --> 02:18:53.365]  Go to the places like Save InfoWars.
[02:18:53.365 --> 02:18:58.987]  Continue to keep InfoWars alive, because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[02:18:58.987 --> 02:19:04.950]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[02:19:06.252 --> 02:19:16.640]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:29.369]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[02:19:30.049 --> 02:19:41.552]  Treatment packages specifically for COVID, post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes, and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[02:19:41.552 --> 02:19:49.754]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health advice.
[02:19:49.754 --> 02:19:57.916]  Come see The Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to The Wellness Company.
[02:19:59.733 --> 02:20:05.654]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[02:20:13.812 --> 02:20:15.453]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:20:15.453 --> 02:20:16.033]  to 3 p.m.
[02:20:16.033 --> 02:20:16.473]  Central.
[02:20:16.473 --> 02:20:18.674]  It's the vaunted Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:18.674 --> 02:20:20.595]  Very blessed and honored to be here today.
[02:20:20.595 --> 02:20:21.895]  Very thankful for all of you tuning in.
[02:20:21.895 --> 02:20:23.576]  I just want to invite you to the InfoWars.
[02:20:23.576 --> 02:20:30.959]  Remember, you are everything when you decide to share the links, the articles, the live feeds, from InfoWars.com forward slash show on Bandai Video.
[02:20:30.959 --> 02:20:32.379]  Please keep it up.
[02:20:32.379 --> 02:20:33.440]  The enemy is very upset.
[02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:33.940]  So Barnes,
[02:20:34.963 --> 02:20:39.006]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer joining us here, been involved in lawsuits against Twitter and more.
[02:20:39.006 --> 02:20:42.289]  I like Elon leading the charge to expose censorship.
[02:20:42.289 --> 02:20:54.399]  He at least is doing a better job than other establishment outlets like Google and Facebook and Apple, who are helping, you know, in some cases like Apple run death camps in China.
[02:20:54.399 --> 02:20:56.941]  But watching what Elon's doing, what do you think he's really doing?
[02:20:56.941 --> 02:21:03.386]  What do you make of the first Twitter file drops, which just confirm what we already knew, and where do you see all this going?
[02:21:04.758 --> 02:21:10.922]  Well, I mean, I think it's definitely an improvement over where it was.
[02:21:10.922 --> 02:21:13.904]  Whether it'll reach the place a lot of people have hopes it for,
[02:21:15.102 --> 02:21:16.403]  Is yet to be determined.
[02:21:16.403 --> 02:21:35.718]  So I think at this level, it's great that he is giving journalists and independent folks access to the internal files that show the scale, the scope, the direction, the deception that went into all the big election fornication of 2020, of which Twitter was a critical component.
[02:21:35.718 --> 02:21:41.482]  As Musk himself has acknowledged, there was, Twitter clearly interfered in a range of elections.
[02:21:41.482 --> 02:21:42.663]  2020 U.S.
[02:21:42.663 --> 02:21:43.984]  election was just one of those.
[02:21:44.504 --> 02:21:51.414]  He's mentioned maybe that it's also done it in Brazil and that he'll be that he'll be researching that further.
[02:21:51.414 --> 02:21:53.176]  So that's hopeful.
[02:21:53.176 --> 02:21:57.542]  But you see the scale of it and hopefully it continues in particular.
[02:21:57.542 --> 02:22:00.827]  I would say where he is not yet met his own test.
[02:22:01.368 --> 02:22:08.794]  For promoting freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of debate, freedom of discussion is in the COVID context.
[02:22:08.794 --> 02:22:11.296]  Peter McCullough is still banned.
[02:22:11.296 --> 02:22:13.698]  Robert Malone is still banned.
[02:22:13.698 --> 02:22:15.439]  There's still algorithmic bans.
[02:22:15.439 --> 02:22:17.701]  There's people that search my name still can't find it.
[02:22:18.557 --> 02:22:21.459]  So there's still shadow bans still in place.
[02:22:21.459 --> 02:22:26.041]  And in particular, the COVID context is where a lot of people have not yet been restored.
[02:22:26.041 --> 02:22:33.785]  So I think that there's a lot more he can do for the free speech movement, for transparency in America.
[02:22:33.785 --> 02:22:36.866]  But he's definitely a massive improvement over where it was.
[02:22:36.866 --> 02:22:43.990]  And what he's disclosing and divulging is things that we suspected were true, things that Twitter's been accused of doing.
[02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:45.951]  But now we're seeing the proof, including
[02:22:46.591 --> 02:22:54.561]  The Biden administration clearly lying about what they knew and didn't know about suppression of the story of the Hunter Biden laptop store.
[02:22:54.561 --> 02:23:05.315]  But I think the big story that Musk has also talked about that I think should be the number one target of Republicans in the House for impeachment, potential impeachment hearings, is the FTX story.
[02:23:05.855 --> 02:23:15.240]  As he put out, he suspects that FTX didn't just put in 30 million or 70 million or 140 million into the Democratic Party over the last two years.
[02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:22.424]  This Ponzi fraud scheme on the crypto exchanges that also is attempting to disrupt and derail Bitcoin.
[02:23:22.424 --> 02:23:25.866]  It likely won't succeed in doing so, but that appears to be part of the goal.
[02:23:25.866 --> 02:23:29.368]  Replace it with central bank digital currencies like a Fed coin.
[02:23:29.368 --> 02:23:34.811]  But it's clear, according to Elon Musk, he suspects that they laundered a billion dollars
[02:23:35.484 --> 02:23:39.626]  To the Democratic Party and its allied organizations through FTX.
[02:23:39.626 --> 02:23:41.287]  A billion dollars!
[02:23:41.287 --> 02:23:43.769]  I mean, remember with Richard Nixon and Watergate?
[02:23:43.769 --> 02:23:47.591]  They were talking about small, like what, $25,000 donations?
[02:23:47.591 --> 02:23:49.052]  $75,000 donations?
[02:23:49.052 --> 02:23:53.895]  What's a billion dollars funded by fraud by an FTX that was protected
[02:23:54.614 --> 02:23:55.214]  We're good to go.
[02:24:12.140 --> 02:24:17.587]  Different treatments for COVID, discrediting ivermectin, discrediting hydroxychloroquine.
[02:24:17.587 --> 02:24:21.492]  He put in tens of millions to do that, funding all sorts of leftist groups.
[02:24:21.492 --> 02:24:28.221]  He was installed, set up to run his pump and dump, which they would then turn around and use to bring down Bitcoin, but now it's blown up in their face.
[02:24:29.568 --> 02:24:30.208]  Completely!
[02:24:30.208 --> 02:24:38.393]  And I think that's the biggest scandal, maybe the biggest political scandal in our history, in terms of at least the amounts of money involved.
[02:24:38.393 --> 02:24:50.980]  Basically, the Democratic Party set up a young Bernie Madoff to rip off a bunch of people so that they could enrich themselves and enrich their political allies and their political causes, including his aunt who sits at the World Economic Forum.
[02:24:51.500 --> 02:24:53.682]  And now we've seen the New York Times doing facelifts for FTX.
[02:24:53.682 --> 02:24:55.964]  These are the little disgusting criminals we're up against.
[02:24:55.964 --> 02:24:56.445]  I mean, look at them.
[02:25:16.983 --> 02:25:18.025]  Absolutely!
[02:25:18.025 --> 02:25:22.831]  I mean, if this was done on behalf of Trump, everybody would already be locked up now.
[02:25:22.831 --> 02:25:31.822]  And instead, you know, the SBF, their Sam Bankman-Fried, another one of these two last name guys, is just chatting away in the Bahamas.
[02:25:32.262 --> 02:25:36.243]  The CEO, it was spotted at a coffee shop in New York.
[02:25:36.243 --> 02:25:37.724]  There's been no consequence.
[02:25:37.724 --> 02:25:42.345]  I mean, you've had to deal with the insanity of the folks up in New York.
[02:25:42.345 --> 02:25:44.166]  Trump has had to deal with that insanity.
[02:25:44.166 --> 02:25:46.707]  Why were they completely asleep at the wheel?
[02:25:46.707 --> 02:25:51.148]  Why was the SEC Commissioner personally meeting with SPF and promoting him?
[02:25:51.148 --> 02:25:55.849]  Right now, Maxine Waters is on social media promoting him, right to this day.
[02:25:55.849 --> 02:26:00.571]  So the Democrats are seeking, and as you note, the New York Times writing puff peeves about him.
[02:26:00.952 --> 02:26:08.931]  So the institutional democratic left engaged in a massive positive... Other than having televised interviews with him, like TED Talks, worshipping him.
[02:26:10.271 --> 02:26:11.031]  Absolutely!
[02:26:11.031 --> 02:26:16.493]  That he's a sweetheart and well... I mean, this is a guy compared to Warren Buffett by Jim Cramer at CNBC.
[02:26:16.493 --> 02:26:18.693]  This was a guy that was called the savior.
[02:26:18.693 --> 02:26:35.838]  And not only did he contaminate the entire environment in crypto to try to derail Bitcoin, and was the leading effort to regulate Bitcoin, and try to limit its ability to compete with the US currency and other currencies of the state governments and central banks,
[02:26:36.403 --> 02:26:43.427]  But he was also, clearly they're moneybags for the pandemic policies, but also moneybags for the Democratic Party.
[02:26:43.427 --> 02:26:46.609]  So does he get away with it, that little slimy Bernie Madoff?
[02:26:48.450 --> 02:26:48.930]  Completely!
[02:26:48.930 --> 02:26:52.392]  I mean, and not only that, and then of course, as we now know, he's tied to Ukraine.
[02:26:52.392 --> 02:26:53.732]  Ukraine, we were using him.
[02:26:53.732 --> 02:26:56.753]  Everybody knows Ukraine is one big fat money laundering machine.
[02:26:56.753 --> 02:27:00.275]  That's what Zelensky spends each day doing, is washing those dollars.
[02:27:00.275 --> 02:27:04.476]  But now, of course, we know that money came through there.
[02:27:04.476 --> 02:27:14.140]  So you may have had government money used to fund Democratic campaigns through the laundry machine of a combination of Ukraine and FTX.
[02:27:14.733 --> 02:27:34.163]  So if Republicans are serious at all about doing anything with their House power, now they've taken over the House of Representatives, their first and foremost priority should be exposing the scam that is FTX and the Democratic Party, its connections to Biden, because it implicates their efforts to do central bank digital currency.
[02:27:34.163 --> 02:27:34.803]  So let's talk about this.
[02:27:34.803 --> 02:27:35.323]  You're a smart guy.
[02:27:35.323 --> 02:27:36.084]  I have a lot of connections.
[02:27:37.173 --> 02:27:47.270]  Obviously some good people online started exposing FTX last year, and this could really bring down a large portion of the deep state.
[02:27:47.270 --> 02:27:49.193]  Is that what you're getting at?
[02:27:49.193 --> 02:27:49.954]  Absolutely it isn't.
[02:27:49.954 --> 02:27:51.677]  FTX was the deep state's piggy bank.
[02:27:52.279 --> 02:28:08.784]  And it was the Deep State's piggy bank to fund the war in Ukraine, Deep State's piggy bank to fund pandemic politics, to suppress ivermectin, to push vaccines, it was the Deep State's piggy bank to get out to vote for Democrats in key races and key places like Arizona so they could keep populists like them.
[02:28:08.784 --> 02:28:16.507]  So just like the CIA used cocaine, crack cocaine, to fund the Contras, that was their piggy bank, FTX is the Democratic Party's piggy bank.
[02:28:17.678 --> 02:28:20.761]  FTX is BCCI on steroids.
[02:28:20.761 --> 02:28:23.723]  I mean, that's what it basically exposes.
[02:28:23.723 --> 02:28:32.990]  And that's why, if they really dig in, this not only exposes the Biden administration and the Democratic Party writ large, it exposes the media establishment, it exposes every aspect of the D.C.
[02:28:32.990 --> 02:28:33.911]  Trump, stay there!
[02:28:33.911 --> 02:28:39.896]  So this is the Bank of International Credit and Settlements, this is literally the BCCI
[02:28:42.060 --> 02:28:42.961]  2.0.
[02:28:42.961 --> 02:28:43.942]  This is unbelievable.
[02:28:43.942 --> 02:28:44.222]  Wow.
[02:28:44.222 --> 02:28:52.548]  All right, I want to come back and just cover the waterfront, more on Ukraine, these missile strikes, inside Russia, the economy, and so much more with Robert Barnes.
[02:28:52.548 --> 02:28:52.948]  Stay with us.
[02:28:57.981 --> 02:29:07.183]  Christmas 2022 is almost here, and we have great products at InfoWarsTore.com that empower your body, your libido, your immune system, that just enrich your life.
[02:29:07.183 --> 02:29:16.966]  So whether it's Vitamin Mineral Fusion, or DNA Force Plus, or Body's Ultimate Tumor Formula, they're all still in stock, discounted up to 60% with promo code 1776.
[02:29:16.966 --> 02:29:19.967]  And now, finally, we have brought back free shipping
[02:29:20.307 --> 02:29:20.607]  Thank you.
[02:29:41.005 --> 02:29:41.606]  We're good to go.
[02:29:57.998 --> 02:30:09.311]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[02:30:09.311 --> 02:30:11.233]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[02:30:11.233 --> 02:30:12.675]  That's what they want to take away.
[02:30:12.675 --> 02:30:14.177]  Your ability to speak freely.
[02:30:14.177 --> 02:30:15.899]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[02:30:15.899 --> 02:30:17.180]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[02:30:17.180 --> 02:30:18.582]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[02:30:18.982 --> 02:30:23.828]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[02:30:23.828 --> 02:30:26.231]  And I warned the public, as a modern Paul Revere.
[02:30:26.231 --> 02:30:28.253]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[02:30:28.253 --> 02:30:35.201]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet about East America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[02:30:35.822 --> 02:30:41.227]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.

[02:30:58.226 --> 02:31:05.211]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[02:31:05.211 --> 02:31:10.414]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[02:31:10.414 --> 02:31:17.459]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[02:31:17.459 --> 02:31:21.502]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.

[02:31:57.662 --> 02:32:03.645]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[02:32:03.645 --> 02:32:07.807]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:32:07.807 --> 02:32:14.050]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:32:15.851 --> 02:32:22.993]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[02:32:22.993 --> 02:32:28.855]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:32:28.855 --> 02:32:37.557]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including
[02:32:38.517 --> 02:32:43.759]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[02:33:17.178 --> 02:33:24.243]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.243 --> 02:33:26.825]  Alright, Robert Barnes is our guest.
[02:33:26.825 --> 02:33:34.651]  I want to get into Russia and these missile strikes a hundred miles inside Russia at their nuclear bomber base that Ukraine is getting credit for doing.
[02:33:34.651 --> 02:33:41.096]  Now I understand that escalation is, but first I want to get into the Ye interview Thursday, the Kanye West biggest thing
[02:33:42.719 --> 02:33:44.981]  I mean, Everett, we're talking probably a billion views out there.
[02:33:44.981 --> 02:33:47.983]  I had no idea he was going to do that.
[02:33:47.983 --> 02:33:56.649]  I didn't say what he could say when he came here, but I said to him, you know, you should talk about other big topics and things and not be baited into this stuff.
[02:33:56.649 --> 02:33:59.851]  He's like, yeah, I want to talk about love and talk about my campaign and all this.
[02:33:59.851 --> 02:34:05.194]  But once he got here, that's where they went.
[02:34:05.194 --> 02:34:06.575]  And, you know, I'm still not sure.
[02:34:06.575 --> 02:34:11.359]  I talked to him quite a bit on the phone where this is all going or what his point is.
[02:34:12.918 --> 02:34:18.063]  If I look at the Mar-a-Lago thing, at least he's honest, Trump did not know.
[02:34:18.063 --> 02:34:22.448]  And then Trump said, y'all meet with the EA, and he gets there and he doesn't know who Nick Fuentes is and these people.
[02:34:22.448 --> 02:34:28.894]  And they go to the dinner with him, and then Trump gets mad at him at the dinner when he learns who Nick Fuentes is.
[02:34:28.894 --> 02:34:33.239]  And the media misrepresents who Nick is, but I saw this happen.
[02:34:34.682 --> 02:34:39.564]  Now that they've called Fuentes that, he's like embracing it and saying, okay, I do like Hitler.
[02:34:39.564 --> 02:34:42.526]  So before, I never heard Nick Fuentes say stuff like that.
[02:34:42.526 --> 02:34:44.967]  Now he is, so I disagree with what Nick Fuentes is saying.
[02:34:44.967 --> 02:34:46.928]  I disagree with his worldview.
[02:34:46.928 --> 02:34:49.669]  And Richard Spencer was out there in a video.
[02:34:49.669 --> 02:34:50.750]  In fact, find that from yesterday.
[02:34:50.750 --> 02:34:51.851]  I went to get to it.
[02:34:51.851 --> 02:34:56.853]  By saying, oh, finally, he knows the dark power of Hitler and how beautiful it is.
[02:34:56.853 --> 02:34:57.914]  Yeah, dark power is right.
[02:34:59.122 --> 02:35:02.206]  Oh, and it was the left everywhere.
[02:35:02.206 --> 02:35:04.529]  NBC News, Texas Monthly, all of them.
[02:35:04.529 --> 02:35:06.711]  Jones was just mad that Yates said it out loud.
[02:35:07.611 --> 02:35:09.872]  Jones is really pro-Hitler, too.
[02:35:09.872 --> 02:35:12.593]  Now, I'm not like George Soros that rounded up Jews.
[02:35:12.593 --> 02:35:14.194]  Both my grandfathers almost died in World War II.
[02:35:14.194 --> 02:35:14.974]  I've read a lot of history.
[02:35:14.974 --> 02:35:18.376]  I've stated Hitler was really, really bad news.
[02:35:18.376 --> 02:35:20.957]  I was a total authoritarian.
[02:35:20.957 --> 02:35:28.900]  My grandfather, you know, told me about things that he did to people that my grandfather knew who were German, not Jewish.
[02:35:28.900 --> 02:35:33.202]  And so I legitimately am a history buff, and so I'm very offended
[02:35:34.022 --> 02:35:34.342]  Bye.
[02:35:52.139 --> 02:35:56.284]  Don't like some failed political party from 76, 78 years ago.
[02:35:56.284 --> 02:36:00.849]  And I don't have a fetish with Hugo Boss uniforms and the rest of it.
[02:36:00.849 --> 02:36:03.452]  I find it absolutely disgusting.
[02:36:03.452 --> 02:36:06.335]  So that's where I'm at on this, but I think yay.
[02:36:07.476 --> 02:36:09.458]  I wouldn't call him mentally ill.
[02:36:09.458 --> 02:36:11.260]  I think he means well for the First Amendment.
[02:36:11.260 --> 02:36:15.605]  I think he was trying to be shocking, but I think he was wound up to basically do what he did then.
[02:36:15.605 --> 02:36:23.193]  I told him, I said, I'd like to have a real interview with you on real topics, but what's your view on that whole fiasco and train wreck?
[02:36:23.193 --> 02:36:24.654]  Will any good come out of it?
[02:36:24.654 --> 02:36:25.115]  What's your view?
[02:36:26.814 --> 02:36:30.197]  I'm trying to get a read on where Kanye's at.
[02:36:30.197 --> 02:36:32.099]  I have a couple of different interpretations.
[02:36:32.099 --> 02:36:47.631]  One alternative explanation is based on his early part of his interview with Tim Pool, where he disclosed that someone has told him he owes $50 million in taxes and that he may be subject to an IRS criminal case.
[02:36:47.631 --> 02:36:50.554]  That made him nervous and edgy.
[02:36:50.554 --> 02:36:55.838]  The fact that he and his brain connected that to his public persona on politics,
[02:36:56.491 --> 02:37:18.836]  Suggested to me at least one alternative take maybe that you know if you were Kanye you the case you would research for you know who was a prominent person who was accused of having unusual beliefs and accused of tax evasion who ultimately was acquitted of almost all the charges well that would be my client Wesley Snipes and that's also he's also african-american he's also male he's also a celebrity in the Hollywood world
[02:37:19.551 --> 02:37:27.595]  And a lot of the headlines back then said, quoted something we made a statement of, which we said if Crazy was criminal, half of Hollywood would be in prison.
[02:37:27.595 --> 02:37:29.876]  So our point was Crazy wasn't criminal.
[02:37:29.876 --> 02:37:35.258]  Some people perceived the Snipes case as Snipes getting acquitted because he was quote-unquote crazy.
[02:37:35.258 --> 02:37:39.340]  That's not actually what happened at the trial, but it's how a lot of media represented it.
[02:37:40.063 --> 02:37:50.210]  It may be the case that Kanye thinks that if he is perceived as crazy, that that will reduce the risk of criminal prosecution on taxes.
[02:37:50.210 --> 02:37:56.894]  Because if you're looking at $50 million, you're talking about 25 years hanging out with El Chapo and Super Max.
[02:37:56.894 --> 02:37:59.596]  I mean, it's something like that.
[02:37:59.596 --> 02:38:04.900]  He would be facing the end of his career, not only the end of his career, but the end of his natural born life in a prison.
[02:38:05.473 --> 02:38:12.919]  So it might be in his interest to be like, OK, I'll take some hits and sacrifice some things on the financial side in order to first to try to get close to Trump.
[02:38:12.919 --> 02:38:14.680]  Well, now Trump's out of power.
[02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:15.981]  So now what do I do?
[02:38:15.981 --> 02:38:22.126]  Well, maybe I create an image like that people and people remember you, the famous mobster case in New York.
[02:38:22.126 --> 02:38:30.092]  People, maybe I create an image that I'm crazy and I say things that are so wild that people say I can't be anything but crazy.
[02:38:30.092 --> 02:38:32.314]  So you think he's going for an insanity defense?
[02:38:33.726 --> 02:38:39.712]  In essence, he may have misinterpreted the headlines from the Snipes defense to mean that if you're crazy, you can't go to prison.
[02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:42.521]  In the tax context.
[02:38:42.521 --> 02:38:44.242]  Actually, it's a more nuanced defense.
[02:38:44.242 --> 02:38:46.824]  It's the good faith defense, reliance defense.
[02:38:46.824 --> 02:38:49.085]  He may have those defenses, too.
[02:38:49.085 --> 02:38:56.970]  And it may be that his accountants may be of a particular religious background that might explain some of his anger and animosity that got him into trouble.
[02:38:56.970 --> 02:38:57.431]  I don't know.
[02:38:57.431 --> 02:39:05.196]  I agree with you that there's no rational explanation for why he's being so self-destructive.
[02:39:05.928 --> 02:39:09.733]  Uh, I don't really believe he really hosts, I don't think he likes Hitler.
[02:39:09.733 --> 02:39:10.975]  I don't believe that for a second.
[02:39:10.975 --> 02:39:12.197]  I really don't.
[02:39:12.197 --> 02:39:17.504]  Um, so he's never given off malevolent vibes, malicious vibes before.
[02:39:17.504 --> 02:39:22.391]  And so, and he still doesn't really, while he's saying things that sound malevolent and sound malicious.
[02:39:22.913 --> 02:39:26.295]  So I think there's something else going on.
[02:39:26.295 --> 02:39:27.236]  It's always possible.
[02:39:27.236 --> 02:39:30.718]  I mean, we know those guys that folks out in Hollywood, they get to Kanye's age.
[02:39:30.718 --> 02:39:34.140]  A lot of them fall apart because they were stars when they were really young.
[02:39:34.140 --> 02:39:36.361]  They never matured in a normal way.
[02:39:36.361 --> 02:39:40.224]  They get to their 40s, early 50s, and they do wild and crazy stuff.
[02:39:40.925 --> 02:39:43.307]  What do you think the overall effect of this was, the fallout from it?
[02:40:04.202 --> 02:40:07.866]  Um, I think, I mean, it's, it's, uh, people really believe he's crazy.
[02:40:07.866 --> 02:40:09.307]  I think that's one impact.
[02:40:09.307 --> 02:40:14.032]  And that will have a negative impact on certain aspects, but again, maybe in his mind will have some positive benefits.
[02:40:15.139 --> 02:40:24.644]  I think it marginalized some people that were trying to promote themselves into the mainstream, much like Richard Spencer tried to, you know, piggyback off of Trump to look normal.
[02:40:24.644 --> 02:40:28.026]  And then when people realized what he believed, they weren't interested in that.
[02:40:28.026 --> 02:40:35.751]  That's all mythology of the left, that, you know, there's this tiny, tiny little splinter group of people who believe these, you know, crazy ideas.
[02:40:35.751 --> 02:40:39.913]  I was about to say, I mean, in a way, Ye gave a big lie preserver.
[02:40:41.095 --> 02:40:46.079]  Or an escape boat of the Democrats, because Hitler's like an almost 80-year-old joke.
[02:40:46.079 --> 02:40:49.862]  He killed 20 million Germans, you know, total loser.
[02:40:49.862 --> 02:41:00.651]  And then you've got this big hip-hop rap icon literally saying this, when the Democrats' whole cosmology is built around, formerly we're all Nazis, now it's all we're all Russian agents.
[02:41:00.651 --> 02:41:02.252]  There's no truth to it.
[02:41:02.252 --> 02:41:05.055]  And then now this just explodes out there.
[02:41:05.055 --> 02:41:06.036]  I'm trying to figure it out.
[02:41:06.036 --> 02:41:08.478]  But no, I did not know that was going to go on on air.
[02:41:08.478 --> 02:41:09.799]  By the way, I support his free speech.
[02:41:10.779 --> 02:41:11.679]  And I let him say it.
[02:41:11.679 --> 02:41:12.940]  I didn't agree with it.
[02:41:12.940 --> 02:41:15.261]  See, see, see, that's the difference, folks.
[02:41:15.261 --> 02:41:17.601]  Free speech means you let people have their speech.
[02:41:17.601 --> 02:41:22.363]  And I know the general audience gets that, but the left's like, Jones endorses that, he let him say it.
[02:41:22.363 --> 02:41:25.504]  Well, you guys all certainly grabbed what he said and put it out for a debate.
[02:41:25.504 --> 02:41:26.384]  That's the whole point of it.
[02:41:28.456 --> 02:41:28.977]  Oh, exactly.
[02:41:28.977 --> 02:41:33.280]  I mean, your reviews on this have been well-established for a long time.
[02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:39.306]  I mean, when people say racism or anti-Semitism with Alex Jones, that makes zero sense at all.
[02:41:39.306 --> 02:41:42.388]  And have attacked and criticized and critiqued people that have voiced those.
[02:41:42.388 --> 02:41:43.389]  And you said it right there in the air.
[02:41:43.389 --> 02:41:44.390]  You said, I don't like Hitler.
[02:41:44.390 --> 02:41:44.851]  Period.
[02:41:44.851 --> 02:41:45.211]  Sorry.
[02:41:45.211 --> 02:41:48.654]  You know, you can think what you want, but no, that's a place I'm not going there with you.
[02:41:49.114 --> 02:41:52.676]  So, you were very clear on all of that.
[02:41:52.676 --> 02:41:59.419]  It's too bad, in my view, because I thought Kanye had some potential intriguing insights as a person with a big cultural platform.
[02:41:59.419 --> 02:41:59.699]  Well, sure.
[02:41:59.699 --> 02:42:09.023]  I mean, I see the Hitler thing like a lot of these elites are into being, like these powerful executives want to be beaten by a dominatrix, or they want to eat poop, or be peed on.
[02:42:09.023 --> 02:42:10.604]  I don't want to be beaten by a dominatrix.
[02:42:10.604 --> 02:42:11.324]  I don't want to eat poop.
[02:42:11.824 --> 02:42:14.666]  And I see liking Hitler is like the naughty time.
[02:42:14.666 --> 02:42:15.907]  Let's go eat poop.
[02:42:15.907 --> 02:42:17.289]  The left loves Hitler.
[02:42:17.289 --> 02:42:18.189]  They obsess on him.
[02:42:18.189 --> 02:42:18.950]  They worship him.
[02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:22.733]  They need him to pretend they're not that when everything they do is like that.
[02:42:22.733 --> 02:42:25.735]  No, I'm not like you Hitler loving leftists.
[02:42:25.735 --> 02:42:26.996]  I don't eat poop.
[02:42:26.996 --> 02:42:29.458]  I'm not a pedophile either.
[02:42:29.458 --> 02:42:30.119]  Oh, exactly.
[02:42:30.119 --> 02:42:32.781]  And I mean, I mean, Hitler had deep state ties from the very beginning.
[02:42:32.781 --> 02:42:36.364]  I mean, so the loving Hitler is like eating poop.
[02:42:37.549 --> 02:42:38.189]  Seriously.
[02:42:38.189 --> 02:42:38.569]  Absolutely.
[02:42:38.569 --> 02:42:44.091]  Communists like fascists because they, and a fascist like the communists because they justify each other's presence.
[02:42:44.091 --> 02:42:45.531]  Stalin admired Hitler.
[02:42:45.531 --> 02:42:46.711]  It's on record.
[02:42:46.711 --> 02:42:47.672]  And I hate him.
[02:42:47.672 --> 02:42:50.753]  Loving communism is like eating poop.
[02:42:50.753 --> 02:42:52.513]  I don't like communism or fascism.
[02:42:52.513 --> 02:42:53.833]  Different.
[02:42:53.833 --> 02:42:54.453]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:54.453 --> 02:42:55.354]  Sorry about the gross analogy.
[02:42:55.354 --> 02:42:56.034]  I just can't handle it.
[02:42:58.171 --> 02:43:06.996]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:43:06.996 --> 02:43:10.838]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[02:43:10.838 --> 02:43:19.903]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company and they're able to cut our regular shipping costs by up to 50%.
[02:43:19.903 --> 02:43:21.945]  So that means even on orders that are below $50,
[02:43:22.705 --> 02:43:26.147]  You're going to be paying way lower than you were previously.
[02:43:26.147 --> 02:43:27.608]  This is a game changer.
[02:43:27.608 --> 02:43:29.149]  We're so excited about it.
[02:43:29.149 --> 02:43:31.410]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[02:43:31.410 --> 02:43:35.833]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[02:43:35.833 --> 02:43:38.955]  So now, your orders will be shipped even faster.
[02:43:38.955 --> 02:43:41.396]  The same great customer service and more.
[02:43:41.396 --> 02:43:47.159]  So, get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at infowarestore.com right now.

[02:43:58.227 --> 02:44:09.974]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[02:44:09.974 --> 02:44:13.357]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it worked
[02:44:13.917 --> 02:44:39.974]  Pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that excuse you had you know with a deep root source you know and I got really excited about that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one I like recently
[02:44:39.974 --> 02:44:43.818]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[02:45:05.345 --> 02:45:15.734]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[02:45:15.734 --> 02:45:28.485]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[02:45:29.145 --> 02:45:40.650]  Treatment packages specifically for COVID, post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes, and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[02:45:40.650 --> 02:45:48.854]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health advice.
[02:45:48.854 --> 02:45:57.018]  Come see The Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to The Wellness Company.
[02:45:58.237 --> 02:46:09.720]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[02:46:09.720 --> 02:46:14.181]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[02:46:14.181 --> 02:46:18.142]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[02:46:18.142 --> 02:46:21.483]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[02:46:21.483 --> 02:46:22.884]  You see, the sun
[02:46:24.384 --> 02:46:24.704]  We're good.
[02:46:48.311 --> 02:46:49.352]  Final segment with Robert Barnes.
[02:46:49.352 --> 02:46:53.095]  I'll host about 15 minutes to the next hour before Gerald Cilenti takes over.
[02:46:53.095 --> 02:46:54.136]  And a lot of news I haven't hit yet.
[02:47:18.419 --> 02:47:19.880]  But I wanted to get a vaccine update.
[02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:22.562]  Robert Barnes is involved with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:47:22.562 --> 02:47:23.543]  in the big lawsuits.
[02:47:23.543 --> 02:47:26.765]  It's coming out in major governments that they know the vaccine's deadly.
[02:47:26.765 --> 02:47:27.625]  It's not a vaccine.
[02:47:27.625 --> 02:47:29.707]  This is huge moment we're at.
[02:47:29.707 --> 02:47:31.348]  I wanted to cover that with him.
[02:47:31.348 --> 02:47:38.433]  But first, let's get into that other topic we were just discussing during the break, the Oath Keepers.
[02:47:38.433 --> 02:47:42.676]  After I saw the trial, read the transcripts, Stuart Rhodes did nothing wrong.
[02:47:43.590 --> 02:47:46.811]  Other than, I think, being surrounded by some feds and informants.
[02:47:46.811 --> 02:47:48.931]  I asked Barnes' opinion without me even telling mine.
[02:47:48.931 --> 02:47:50.131]  That's what he said.
[02:47:50.131 --> 02:47:51.832]  He's been following it very, very closely.
[02:47:51.832 --> 02:47:53.532]  Stuart Rhodes did nothing.
[02:47:53.532 --> 02:47:57.253]  Found not guilty of trying to stop the certification of the vote.
[02:47:57.253 --> 02:48:01.233]  Found not guilty of trying to block Congress, but guilty of seditious conspiracy.
[02:48:01.233 --> 02:48:04.434]  So he's guilty of a conspiracy, but he didn't carry it out.
[02:48:04.434 --> 02:48:09.615]  Again, Stuart Rhodes completely set up, no doubt about it, your expert take on that.
[02:48:10.757 --> 02:48:11.077]  Absolutely.
[02:48:11.077 --> 02:48:17.941]  I mean, first of all, the mere fact that any sedition charges are pending or that this law still exists is something that is a disgrace to American freedom.
[02:48:17.941 --> 02:48:29.987]  This law has historically, the sedition laws, going back to the Alien and Sedition Acts in the early beginning of the country, which Thomas Jefferson rightly denounced as wrongful and directly against the constitutional history, and were thrown out pretty quickly.
[02:48:29.987 --> 02:48:34.429]  Then we bring them back for World War I to promote World War I. We lock up Eugene V. Debs.
[02:48:34.429 --> 02:48:38.731]  We lock up Victor Berger, a congressman from Milwaukee, just for opposing World War
[02:48:38.831 --> 02:48:39.792]  We're good to go.
[02:48:52.853 --> 02:48:54.934]  But the next part is what happened at the trial.
[02:48:54.934 --> 02:48:58.156]  The trial never should have taken place in the District of Columbia.
[02:48:58.156 --> 02:48:59.816]  The D.C.
[02:48:59.816 --> 02:49:10.581]  Martin Luther King could have got a fair jury in 1950s Birmingham from an all-white jury pool than can any Trump ally in the District of Columbia.
[02:49:10.581 --> 02:49:15.944]  They've proven that again and again and again and they proved it again here with issuing verdicts that made no sense.
[02:49:16.759 --> 02:49:33.470]  The evidence was so overwhelming that Stuart Rhodes did absolutely nothing that day to interfere or impair anything the government was doing that even a bunch of hardcore Trump haters had to admit that and then they convict him of some speech!
[02:49:33.470 --> 02:49:37.353]  Basically the seditious conspiracy conviction is based on speech!
[02:49:37.913 --> 02:49:42.396]  They're like, oh, you know, he tweeted something, he texted something, he made a comment once.
[02:49:42.396 --> 02:49:43.576]  This is insane.
[02:49:43.576 --> 02:49:49.600]  Not only that, all of these people were not trying to impair or interfere with anything.
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:50:01.647]  They were trying to make sure that our Congress did what the Constitution required them to do, which is a meaningful review of whether the election was constitutionally conducted.
[02:50:01.647 --> 02:50:03.108]  That's their constitutional oath.
[02:50:03.672 --> 02:50:07.695]  So the Oath Keepers were just making sure Congress kept its oath.
[02:50:07.695 --> 02:50:10.897]  They weren't trying to prevent Congress from doing its oath.
[02:50:10.897 --> 02:50:11.737]  Just the opposite.
[02:50:11.737 --> 02:50:15.360]  So where does the whole January 6th fiasco go from here?
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:29.709]  I mean, as everything we talked about from the get-go, that this was a setup, that this was a trap, that this is politically motivated prosecutions, that this is a perversion of justice, has all been proven true and then some.
[02:50:29.709 --> 02:50:32.391]  I mean, there's even more feds and rats than we thought there were.
[02:50:32.811 --> 02:50:45.558]  I mean, they were all over the place, and they were trying to hide them until the last minute, and only in the middle of trial they did disclose that there were almost a dozen rats and informants and feds working right close in the Oath Keepers.
[02:50:45.558 --> 02:50:47.379]  They were the ones behind January 6th.
[02:50:47.379 --> 02:50:51.962]  It was a fedsurrection, not an insurrection, that took place on January 6th.
[02:50:52.691 --> 02:50:55.392]  And we've seen abundant evidence of it from these trials.
[02:50:55.392 --> 02:51:00.033]  So maybe if the House is smart, they'll hold real hearings that will expose this.
[02:51:00.033 --> 02:51:11.216]  And hopefully the next President of the United States pardons everybody with these embarrassing trials the way Thomas Jefferson did for the false charges of the Alien and Sedition Acts more than almost two centuries ago.
[02:51:11.784 --> 02:51:19.867]  And for those that don't know, the Sedition Acts, only used back in the early part of the country and then again during the Civil War, they hadn't used that in a long time.
[02:51:19.867 --> 02:51:21.907]  A few times the Feds have used it, right?
[02:51:21.907 --> 02:51:24.948]  The last 50, 60 years it got struck down, the courts threw it out.
[02:51:24.948 --> 02:51:27.129]  So the fact they're trying to bring this back is really chilling.
[02:51:28.690 --> 02:51:29.591]  Oh, completely.
[02:51:29.591 --> 02:51:32.773]  It's just the weaponization of the legal system writ large.
[02:51:32.773 --> 02:51:42.798]  So whether it's an Austin judge who can't read the law, pretending that punitive damages can be $40 million when they legally cannot be under the law, showing a complete lack of respect for the law.
[02:51:42.798 --> 02:51:45.060]  By the way, speak to that, because people think, oh, that's just Alex complaining.
[02:51:45.060 --> 02:51:45.160]  No.
[02:51:45.700 --> 02:51:49.542]  Found guilty by two judges, rigged trials, telling juries I'm guilty.
[02:51:49.542 --> 02:51:51.123]  They want trillions of dollars.
[02:51:51.123 --> 02:51:53.744]  In Texas, $50 million deal.
[02:51:53.744 --> 02:51:54.864]  It's capped at $5 million.
[02:51:54.864 --> 02:51:57.065]  The law says that, but she says, I don't care.
[02:51:57.065 --> 02:52:01.407]  Then she said he's also guilty of elder abuse because this guy's above 50-something.
[02:52:01.407 --> 02:52:07.490]  Even though the jury didn't hear that and it's charged, she says, well, the jury also finds him guilty of that after the jury's gone.
[02:52:07.490 --> 02:52:09.891]  I mean, this is like beyond kangaroo court.
[02:52:09.891 --> 02:52:10.792]  This is ridiculous.
[02:52:11.934 --> 02:52:13.095]  Oh, completely.
[02:52:13.095 --> 02:52:29.627]  Any degree to which people had any doubt whether the judge was anything more than a partisan hack who made an embarrassment of the rule of law in Texas was ended when she ignored the statutory cap on damages and then started making up claims that didn't exist in the trial.
[02:52:30.902 --> 02:52:32.404]  I've done elder abuse charges.
[02:52:32.404 --> 02:52:34.206]  This has nothing to do with that.
[02:52:34.206 --> 02:52:36.508]  I mean, it's patently absurd.
[02:52:36.508 --> 02:52:41.994]  The fact that she had to reach for those excuses and pretexts while threatening your lawyers once again.
[02:52:41.994 --> 02:52:46.719]  That she's going to take adverse action against lawyers just for representing you in court effectively.
[02:52:47.319 --> 02:52:54.951]  And so that's what we're seeing, example after example of the legal system being overtly and openly weaponized to go after dissidents.
[02:52:54.951 --> 02:52:57.775]  But this doesn't signal strength, does it?
[02:52:57.775 --> 02:53:02.783]  If you had to look at this as a football game at halftime, how's the Deep State doing versus Team America?
[02:53:04.028 --> 02:53:08.754]  Well, if they wouldn't be this desperate, they wouldn't be talking about trying to indict President Trump.
[02:53:08.754 --> 02:53:15.283]  They wouldn't be desperate to avoid a special master review and beg the 11th Circuit to give them undue deference.
[02:53:15.283 --> 02:53:16.745]  They wouldn't be taking these steps.
[02:53:16.745 --> 02:53:18.768]  It's like in our vaccine mandate cases.
[02:53:19.148 --> 02:53:31.917]  So the Western District of Texas, a judge in Waco, is going to decide whether we get to go forward, the Children's Health Defense, Bobby Kennedy and I, against the Food and Drug Administration for all their lies, their litany of lies, about the drug.
[02:53:31.917 --> 02:53:33.018]  They said it was a vaccine.
[02:53:33.018 --> 02:53:33.698]  It's not.
[02:53:33.698 --> 02:53:34.559]  They said it was safe.
[02:53:34.559 --> 02:53:35.259]  It's not.
[02:53:35.259 --> 02:53:36.180]  They said it was effective.
[02:53:36.180 --> 02:53:36.900]  It's not.
[02:53:36.900 --> 02:53:38.421]  Their own research proved it.
[02:53:38.421 --> 02:53:48.108]  They had no lawful right to say so, but they're claiming they have an emergency exception authority that removes them from any legislative oversight, any judicial oversight,
[02:53:48.548 --> 02:53:50.690]  Any right to sue them ever.
[02:53:50.690 --> 02:53:54.372]  So there's a lot of big issues that go beyond COVID implicated in that case.
[02:53:54.372 --> 02:53:57.314]  And so, but why are they so desperate to go there?
[02:53:57.314 --> 02:53:59.216]  Because they know they would lose on the facts.
[02:53:59.216 --> 02:54:02.018]  Same thing in the Brooke Jackson case against Pfizer.
[02:54:02.018 --> 02:54:04.800]  Pfizer's desperate for no discovery to occur.
[02:54:04.800 --> 02:54:12.005]  If they thought the discovery would vindicate their actions, they wouldn't be desperate to hide it all from Brooke Jackson and the public.
[02:54:12.792 --> 02:54:16.294]  So the judge there is going to decide, can we get to discovery or not?
[02:54:16.294 --> 02:54:19.656]  So we're going to find out whether the courts are willing to step up to the plate.
[02:54:19.656 --> 02:54:21.437]  Cary Lake in Arizona, same thing.
[02:54:21.437 --> 02:54:30.102]  I mean, there the Obama judge sanctioned her lawyers for raising issues before the election that turned out to be exactly the problem at the election.
[02:54:30.102 --> 02:54:35.786]  The tabulator machines not working correctly, conveniently, when Republicans were voting en masse.
[02:54:35.786 --> 02:54:40.909]  So we're seeing instance after instance, can our judiciary step up to the plate?
[02:54:41.429 --> 02:54:47.451]  And resist the power of the deep state, big corporations, corrupt election officials, etc.
[02:54:47.451 --> 02:54:48.811]  Big tech censors.
[02:54:48.811 --> 02:54:49.632]  I mean, I agree.
[02:54:49.632 --> 02:54:52.873]  So in closing, the deep state's cornered.
[02:54:52.873 --> 02:54:53.533]  They're in trouble.
[02:54:53.533 --> 02:54:56.694]  Humanity's waking up worldwide.
[02:54:56.694 --> 02:54:58.454]  What curveballs can they throw?
[02:54:58.454 --> 02:55:00.235]  What's the deep state going to pull to try to stay in power?
[02:55:02.003 --> 02:55:03.043]  Anything and everything.
[02:55:03.043 --> 02:55:09.825]  So right now they're really banking on courts being cowards and not stepping up to resist them in all these different contexts.
[02:55:09.825 --> 02:55:11.526]  So like the Carrie Lake case.
[02:55:11.526 --> 02:55:14.206]  She has a very compelling case for an election contest.
[02:55:14.206 --> 02:55:19.388]  If that election contest is not allowed to go forward, that's a failure of the courts to do their job and affirm their oaths.
[02:55:19.989 --> 02:55:25.052]  The same is true in the Trump context, trying to take over his business in New York.
[02:55:25.052 --> 02:55:29.855]  So, can courts step in at some level and say, hold on a second, this has gone too far?
[02:55:29.855 --> 02:55:37.860]  In the Alex Jones cases, when they're on appeal, when they're in front of the bankruptcy court, will some court step forward and say, hold on a second, we've got to affirm the law.
[02:55:37.860 --> 02:55:39.981]  We've got to affirm the higher principles.
[02:55:39.981 --> 02:55:46.085]  We can't get caught up in the politics of these cases and allow our legal system to be weaponized to take out dissidents.
[02:55:47.027 --> 02:56:04.973]  And hopefully, and they're going to push back against Elon Musk disclosing all this information about Twitter, because as the lawsuit about big tech government collusion exposed last week, the FBI was intricately involved in censoring dissidents under the guise of national security.
[02:56:04.973 --> 02:56:09.654]  So it's exposed to the world the need for massive reform.
[02:56:09.654 --> 02:56:11.895]  And exactly, the left criticizes
[02:56:13.174 --> 02:56:19.931]  If the left criticizes McCarthy, what they've done and been caught doing with big tech is like a hundred times bigger.
[02:56:21.138 --> 02:56:23.639]  Oh, absolutely, if it's McCarthy on scale.
[02:56:23.639 --> 02:56:26.900]  It's McCarthyism on scale, and McCarthy focused on the government.
[02:56:26.900 --> 02:56:32.001]  He didn't focus, like the Democrats did, on the distance within their own party.
[02:56:32.001 --> 02:56:38.403]  It was the House Un-American Activities Committee that did the real bad stuff associated with McCarthyism, more so than McCarthy himself.
[02:56:38.403 --> 02:56:40.083]  And they're just replicating it.
[02:56:40.083 --> 02:56:40.863]  They're repeating it.
[02:56:40.863 --> 02:56:43.284]  They're redesigning it, recreating it, re-imposing it.
[02:56:43.949 --> 02:56:49.975]  And so we're at a critical juncture because so much of their effort has been exposed thanks to the audience at InfoWars.
[02:56:49.975 --> 02:56:53.359]  Supporting InfoWars, keeping it on the air wasn't supposed to happen.
[02:56:53.359 --> 02:56:56.121]  Everybody was supposed to panic and hide and run away.
[02:56:56.121 --> 02:56:56.742]  Didn't happen.
[02:56:56.742 --> 02:57:02.448]  People continue to get products that make them healthier, wealthier, and wiser by going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:57:02.928 --> 02:57:11.740]  By keeping InfoWars on the air and the audience keeping people informed, the system has not been able to have the crushing success it sought.
[02:57:11.740 --> 02:57:19.009]  And as long as ordinary people keep fighting back, there's always hope for liberty and freedom in America.
[02:57:19.009 --> 02:57:20.151]  Robert Barnes, thank you so much.
[02:57:20.151 --> 02:57:20.792]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:57:22.071 --> 02:57:22.892]  Absolutely, glad to be out.

[02:58:24.228 --> 02:58:30.912]  So again, that's free shipping on all orders, $50 or more at infowarestore.com.
[02:58:31.232 --> 02:58:31.813]  We're good to go.
[02:58:48.280 --> 02:58:59.768]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[02:58:59.768 --> 02:59:04.230]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[02:59:04.230 --> 02:59:08.193]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[02:59:08.193 --> 02:59:12.636]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[02:59:12.636 --> 02:59:13.717]  You see, the sun
[02:59:14.377 --> 02:59:14.737]  We're good to
[02:59:38.417 --> 02:59:38.918]  We're good.
[03:00:02.486 --> 03:00:13.311]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:13.311 --> 03:00:17.354]  Look, I know this broadcast is overwhelming.
[03:00:17.354 --> 03:00:23.276]  It's overwhelming for me.
[03:00:23.276 --> 03:00:29.900]  But I got to continue on because I can't just go off air and go hide in some ditch and wait for them to come for me.
[03:00:29.900 --> 03:00:31.841]  They're planning new lockdowns, they're planning
[03:00:33.112 --> 03:00:36.553]  Every form of societal control we can imagine.
[03:00:36.553 --> 03:00:43.396]  Because good people have become decadent, we've become distracted, we've been raised in the age of television, the internet.
[03:00:43.396 --> 03:00:45.577]  We don't know what's in us.
[03:00:45.577 --> 03:00:50.938]  And the globalists have the argument that we deserve what's about to happen to us.
[03:00:50.938 --> 03:00:55.940]  We deserve it.
[03:00:55.940 --> 03:00:57.541]  Because if we are these dumbasses,
[03:00:58.968 --> 03:01:06.871]  And even while we're being attacked with bioweapons, through so-called vaccines, if we put up with that, we deserve what happens to us.
[03:01:06.871 --> 03:01:11.753]  Well, I don't deserve what's happening to me, and my children don't deserve it, and I'm not going along with this.
[03:01:11.753 --> 03:01:15.295]  But I gotta tell you, people are fighting back.
[03:01:15.295 --> 03:01:16.615]  And we've tried to keep this peaceful.
[03:01:16.615 --> 03:01:18.736]  I want to keep it peaceful.
[03:01:18.736 --> 03:01:23.538]  But in Brazil, things are about to get hot.
[03:01:23.538 --> 03:01:25.159]  We're going to cover that coming up in the next segment.
[03:01:28.831 --> 03:01:34.653]  But this is really a question of who has the will to be free?
[03:01:34.653 --> 03:01:43.435]  Or who are those who want to delude themselves and just live one day or the next and ignore the fact that the waters of tyranny are rising all around us?
[03:01:43.435 --> 03:01:48.517]  Now, separately, I just did two hours with Hotep Jesus and Robert Barnes.
[03:01:48.517 --> 03:01:53.578]  I got so focused on the news and information, I didn't plug.
[03:01:53.578 --> 03:01:54.979]  And that's in talk radio or anywhere.
[03:01:56.715 --> 03:02:00.936]  Most of the advertising goes on during the segments.
[03:02:00.936 --> 03:02:06.037]  So the biggest problem of InfoWars being on the verge of collapse is me not plugging.
[03:02:06.037 --> 03:02:08.018]  I'll try to do a good job now.
[03:02:08.018 --> 03:02:15.319]  There's no excuse to not go to MyPillow.com forward slash Alex.
[03:02:15.319 --> 03:02:17.220]  We'll put that on screen for you.
[03:02:17.220 --> 03:02:20.520]  Or MyStore.com forward slash Alex.
[03:02:20.520 --> 03:02:21.241]  And get up to the 66% off
[03:02:23.191 --> 03:02:33.280]  The biggest sales of the year on hundreds of great products at MyStore.com and MyPillow.com forward slash Alex.
[03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:35.282]  And that's how you keep us on air.
[03:02:35.282 --> 03:02:36.503]  You do your Christmas shopping there.
[03:02:37.557 --> 03:02:41.040]  And we get a little percent for advertising and help keep us on air.
[03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:53.312]  So do your Christmas shopping at MyStore.com forward slash Alex with their great coffee and thousands of other Made in America products at MyStore.com forward slash Alex or MyPillow.com for all the pillows, sheets, bedding and more.
[03:02:53.312 --> 03:02:55.514]  Here's Mike Lindell talking about it.
[03:02:56.561 --> 03:03:01.326]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm excited to announce my new product, My Coffee.
[03:03:01.326 --> 03:03:07.352]  I get products all the time from entrepreneurs, from my new platform, mystore.com.
[03:03:07.352 --> 03:03:11.317]  And when I tried My Coffee for the first time, I was blown away.
[03:03:11.317 --> 03:03:13.999]  It is the best coffee I've ever had in my life.
[03:03:14.640 --> 03:03:27.069]  I spent the last four months doing my due diligence, and this family-owned business micromanages every step from the fields to the cup to ensure the best quality coffee you're ever going to have.
[03:03:27.069 --> 03:03:30.071]  It starts with the beans that are grown in Honduras.
[03:03:30.071 --> 03:03:38.917]  Honduras' volcanic soil and humid climate make the perfect growing conditions for coffee plants, which produce the best beans ever.
[03:03:39.457 --> 03:03:47.122]  Then each batch is tested for its aroma, taste, and other aspects to meet the highest standards in the coffee industry.
[03:03:47.122 --> 03:03:52.265]  And after that, it goes into production, which is all done right here in the USA.
[03:03:52.265 --> 03:03:58.368]  It's like you're getting that small batch specialty coffee, but delivered right to your front door.
[03:03:58.368 --> 03:04:01.290]  So go to mystore.com or call the number on your screen
[03:04:01.770 --> 03:04:06.792]  Use the promo code and you'll get your very own MyCoffee for 25% off.
[03:04:06.792 --> 03:04:10.533]  You guys all know that I've traveled the country for the past year and a half.
[03:04:10.533 --> 03:04:12.534]  I've stayed in hundreds of hotels.
[03:04:12.534 --> 03:04:14.374]  I've tried every coffee out there.
[03:04:14.374 --> 03:04:17.255]  Well, some of the coffees have that terrible aftertaste.
[03:04:17.255 --> 03:04:20.416]  Some that leave me jittery or I get an upset stomach.
[03:04:20.416 --> 03:04:22.437]  Well, MyCoffee is different.
[03:04:22.437 --> 03:04:25.698]  It's the richest, smoothest, best coffee I've ever had.
[03:04:26.278 --> 03:04:28.840]  My coffee comes in a variety of flavors.
[03:04:28.840 --> 03:04:30.881]  You get them ground or whole bean.
[03:04:30.881 --> 03:04:34.724]  Plus it's certified organic and non-GMO.
[03:04:34.724 --> 03:04:38.146]  I guarantee it'll be the best coffee you've ever had.
[03:04:38.146 --> 03:04:41.628]  So go to mystore.com or call the number on your screen.
[03:04:41.628 --> 03:04:45.131]  Use your promo code and you'll get my coffee for 25% off.
[03:04:45.131 --> 03:04:49.394]  And I'm gonna give you deep discounts on all my store products.
[03:04:49.394 --> 03:04:51.455]  That's mystore.com.
[03:04:51.455 --> 03:04:54.817]  It's my new platform for USA entrepreneurs.
[03:04:54.817 --> 03:04:55.718]  Please order now.
[03:04:58.419 --> 03:05:00.660]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[03:05:00.660 --> 03:05:04.661]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.
[03:05:04.661 --> 03:05:05.981]  There's a solution.
[03:05:05.981 --> 03:05:06.982]  The Wellness Company.
[03:05:06.982 --> 03:05:10.283]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[03:05:10.283 --> 03:05:17.485]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[03:05:17.745 --> 03:05:43.823]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[03:05:44.901 --> 03:05:45.402]  I think so.
[03:06:07.376 --> 03:06:08.836]  All right, just a few minutes.
[03:06:08.836 --> 03:06:16.898]  Gerald Cilente is about to take over, but I wanted to hit a few other items that I mentioned but hadn't drilled into.
[03:06:16.898 --> 03:06:20.059]  And the big one, and I've looked at this, it's true.
[03:06:20.059 --> 03:06:24.960]  Gateway Planet's reporting on it.
[03:06:37.259 --> 03:06:38.440]  Lula stole the election.
[03:06:38.440 --> 03:06:40.842]  The evidence is overwhelming, just like here.
[03:06:40.842 --> 03:06:45.786]  They're trying to social credit scores for the government because Bolsonaro never got full control.
[03:06:45.786 --> 03:06:54.733]  They have the CPS take people's children or use social credit scores to take their bank accounts if they protest the election.
[03:06:54.733 --> 03:06:58.276]  Whether they're right or wrong, they should have a right to do that.
[03:06:58.276 --> 03:06:59.677]  So here's the headline.
[03:06:59.677 --> 03:07:04.681]  Brazil military kills Red Command cartel leaders.
[03:07:04.681 --> 03:07:05.882]  Prepares for takeover.
[03:07:06.704 --> 03:07:13.389]  It goes on to show the military telling the public, be peaceful when we take action to stay in place and do not be violent.
[03:07:13.389 --> 03:07:22.476]  They've now gone and killed the two major drug cartel leaders who admittedly are allied with the government since the mid-1970s.
[03:07:22.476 --> 03:07:28.440]  And so, it's clear that Lula can't even get a thousand people out at a demonstration for him, just like Biden can.
[03:07:30.094 --> 03:07:37.377]  But they'll have crowds of five, six million people in major cities for Bolsonaro.
[03:07:37.377 --> 03:07:41.620]  And we saw the State Department and Big Tech involved in manipulating the election as well.
[03:07:41.620 --> 03:07:54.105]  It's in the Constitution in Brazil that if two branches of government or more get in a heated, locked battle, the military will get involved.
[03:07:54.105 --> 03:07:57.407]  And so that's basically what's happening there right now.
[03:07:57.407 --> 03:07:59.208]  I don't want the military deciding elections.
[03:08:00.376 --> 03:08:04.277]  And our military is controlled by the globalists here, so that's not going to happen anyways.
[03:08:04.277 --> 03:08:12.599]  But in Brazil, they are overall against the corruption, against the drug dealing, against the communists, who have been so incredibly corrupt.
[03:08:12.599 --> 03:08:18.100]  So we're going to continue to watch that situation as it unfolds.
[03:08:18.100 --> 03:08:22.421]  This is obviously a big, big, big deal.
[03:08:23.888 --> 03:08:27.750]  Then I had this newscast that we're going to play here in a moment.
[03:08:27.750 --> 03:08:35.273]  Local authorities shut down Virginia business, a restaurant, two years after violating state COVID policy.
[03:08:35.273 --> 03:08:41.156]  So owner Matt Strickland filmed the entire raid and shamed them for being puppets of the regime.
[03:08:41.156 --> 03:08:48.659]  This is in Virginia with the state police and local police coming into his restaurant and saying, you're shut down for three months.
[03:08:50.031 --> 03:08:53.195]  Because a couple years ago, you didn't lock down.
[03:08:53.195 --> 03:08:56.279]  Now, all the big restaurants can stay open.
[03:08:56.279 --> 03:08:58.281]  All the Walmarts can stay open.
[03:08:58.281 --> 03:09:00.004]  The liquor stores can stay open.
[03:09:00.004 --> 03:09:02.887]  But you're not essential as a restaurant.
[03:09:02.887 --> 03:09:04.449]  It's not a chain.
[03:09:04.449 --> 03:09:05.551]  You've gotta close.
[03:09:06.943 --> 03:09:09.984]  Which, again, is part of the plan that we talked about earlier.
[03:09:09.984 --> 03:09:10.644]  It's official.
[03:09:10.644 --> 03:09:14.165]  France bans short-haul domestic flights in favor of trains.
[03:09:14.165 --> 03:09:20.286]  Private jets are fined, but the general public can't go get charter planes or fly commercially anymore.
[03:09:20.286 --> 03:09:20.827]  Netherlands.
[03:09:20.827 --> 03:09:23.207]  Police use heavy machinery to overturn tractors.
[03:09:23.207 --> 03:09:25.088]  They don't want their farms shut down.
[03:09:25.088 --> 03:09:26.168]  This is not the environment.
[03:09:26.168 --> 03:09:33.650]  This is communists taking over the food supply, cutting off the pipelines, and the infrastructure.
[03:09:34.755 --> 03:09:44.582]  So let's play this chilling clip out of Virginia, understanding this is the criminality of these people, and that they're still trying to prosecute forced shots for the military.
[03:09:44.582 --> 03:09:46.863]  They're still trying to bring back more lockdowns.
[03:09:46.863 --> 03:09:49.125]  They're still trying to bring back mask mandates.
[03:09:49.125 --> 03:09:54.208]  We're never going to get out of this until we prosecute and confront the people that have done this.
[03:09:54.208 --> 03:09:58.111]  Here's the clip of the poor business owner who they're trying to bankrupt.
[03:09:58.111 --> 03:10:03.075]  You've actually been found to be detrimental to the community, but you're still going to shut a man's business down over that.
[03:10:05.039 --> 03:10:09.762]  You're not here to discuss whether or not they're unconscionable.
[03:10:09.762 --> 03:10:12.864]  You're just here to do your job, right?
[03:10:12.864 --> 03:10:23.690]  And you're going to enforce that regardless, right?
[03:10:23.690 --> 03:10:25.190]  So you're part of the problem, man.
[03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:25.971]  I want you to know that.
[03:10:25.971 --> 03:10:26.811]  You're part of the problem.
[03:10:26.811 --> 03:10:28.372]  You're part of the problem.
[03:10:28.372 --> 03:10:29.373]  You're part of the problem.
[03:10:30.475 --> 03:10:32.157]  You're part of the problem.
[03:10:32.157 --> 03:10:33.858]  Everybody in here, every one of you, man.
[03:10:33.858 --> 03:10:35.740]  What's going on in this country right now?
[03:10:35.740 --> 03:10:42.606]  The reason that we're in the situation we're in as the United States of America, you're part of the problem, sir.
[03:10:42.606 --> 03:10:44.849]  So you can't complain about what the President's doing.
[03:10:44.849 --> 03:10:48.212]  You can't complain about the state that the country's in right now.
[03:10:48.212 --> 03:10:50.674]  You can't complain about how screwed up it is.
[03:10:50.674 --> 03:10:52.195]  You're part of the problem, sir.
[03:10:52.195 --> 03:10:53.236]  You're just doing your job.
[03:10:54.344 --> 03:11:00.046]  So many people were just doing their job for Hitler back in Germany.
[03:11:00.046 --> 03:11:00.846]  You as well, sir.
[03:11:00.846 --> 03:11:03.027]  That goes for you as well.
[03:11:03.027 --> 03:11:03.907]  That goes for you as well.
[03:11:03.907 --> 03:11:06.828]  That goes for all of you.
[03:11:06.828 --> 03:11:08.229]  That goes for all of you, man.
[03:11:08.229 --> 03:11:09.249]  There's no excuse.
[03:11:09.249 --> 03:11:11.970]  There's zero excuse.
[03:11:11.970 --> 03:11:13.971]  Just doing my job.
[03:11:13.971 --> 03:11:15.591]  That's not an excuse anymore, man.
[03:11:15.591 --> 03:11:17.232]  That's not an excuse.
[03:11:17.232 --> 03:11:20.933]  You guys just doing your job is facilitating what's going on in this country right now.
[03:11:22.489 --> 03:11:27.555]  You shut down a man's livelihood for not following COVID mandates that didn't do anything.
[03:11:28.675 --> 03:11:30.276]  Anything to prevent COVID.
[03:11:30.276 --> 03:11:32.897]  And it was actually detrimental to the community.
[03:11:32.897 --> 03:11:35.618]  And not just the community, to our kids, man.
[03:11:35.618 --> 03:11:38.679]  It set our kids back so many years, these mandates.
[03:11:38.679 --> 03:11:41.040]  It set small businesses back so many years.
[03:11:41.040 --> 03:11:42.820]  It destroyed small businesses, man.
[03:11:42.820 --> 03:11:44.121]  It destroyed them.
[03:11:44.121 --> 03:11:45.642]  It destroyed families.
[03:11:45.642 --> 03:11:47.622]  It destroyed our community.
[03:11:47.622 --> 03:11:49.983]  And it destroyed our country.
[03:11:49.983 --> 03:11:51.904]  And nobody in here gives a damn about that.
[03:11:51.904 --> 03:11:53.985]  They're just doing their job.
[03:11:53.985 --> 03:11:55.265]  Just doing their job.
[03:11:55.265 --> 03:11:56.726]  And they're gonna continue to do their job.
[03:11:58.410 --> 03:11:58.690]  I don't know.
[03:12:21.804 --> 03:12:26.507]  Again, all selectively enforced, worldwide, the same program to kill our local businesses.
[03:12:26.507 --> 03:12:29.008]  That's why it's important to support local businesses.
[03:12:29.008 --> 03:12:32.571]  And it's why out of all the places to support, it's us, folks.
[03:12:33.442 --> 03:12:35.443]  You know, the media has lied about how much money we have.
[03:12:35.443 --> 03:12:37.124]  It says we have all this extra money.
[03:12:37.124 --> 03:12:38.445]  It's not true.
[03:12:38.445 --> 03:12:41.386]  I'm in personal bankruptcy, so as InfoWars, we can stay on air.
[03:12:41.386 --> 03:12:44.788]  But we need funds to go through the bankruptcy and stabilize, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:12:44.788 --> 03:12:45.809]  It's not a liquidation.
[03:12:45.809 --> 03:12:48.450]  It's a 11-subchapter-5.
[03:12:48.450 --> 03:12:49.691]  Look those up.
[03:12:49.691 --> 03:12:52.932]  It's a reorganization to stay on air, and they can't shut us down.
[03:12:52.932 --> 03:12:54.373]  Their goal is to shut us down.
[03:12:54.373 --> 03:12:55.894]  Please go to InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:12:58.086 --> 03:13:00.590]  We have free shippings back, on order of $50 or more.
[03:13:00.590 --> 03:13:02.853]  Discounted shipping, below $50.
[03:13:02.853 --> 03:13:07.339]  We have Vitamin & Mineral Fusion, DNA Force Plus, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[03:13:07.339 --> 03:13:09.101]  They're gonna sell out very, very soon.
[03:13:09.101 --> 03:13:10.323]  That's how we fund the operation.
[03:13:10.323 --> 03:13:13.187]  Plus, these are very empowering, amazing products.
[03:13:14.008 --> 03:13:16.629]  Super metal vitality, your libido, your stamina, it's incredible.
[03:13:16.629 --> 03:13:18.330]  I want to thank you all for your past support.
[03:13:18.330 --> 03:13:22.572]  I just want to remind you, we're in your hands to stay on air at this critical time.
[03:13:22.572 --> 03:13:27.915]  Our most important work is happening now and is to come, but I'm at peace about this.
[03:13:27.915 --> 03:13:31.817]  But don't let me prove how much we needed funds by us shutting down.
[03:13:31.817 --> 03:13:33.418]  I need you to go to mfullworksstore.com.
[03:13:33.418 --> 03:13:37.860]  I need you to get great products you already need today, and I really appreciate your support.
[03:13:37.860 --> 03:13:38.620]  mfullworksstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:13:38.620 --> 03:13:39.861]  Well, for the next 50 minutes or
[03:13:43.863 --> 03:13:44.864]  Now, thank you.
[03:13:44.864 --> 03:13:45.984]  Thank you for all that you do, Alex.
[03:13:45.984 --> 03:13:50.467]  And everyone, support InfoWars, because you can see what's going on.
[03:13:50.467 --> 03:13:54.369]  And that clip that he just played, now that man was a real man.
[03:14:07.133 --> 03:14:17.879]  Talking to those, uh, those cops dressed up in their military drag, you know, with the hats on and, oh yeah, you know.
[03:14:17.879 --> 03:14:19.460]  That is a real man.
[03:14:19.460 --> 03:14:22.362]  Everything he said was to the point.
[03:14:22.362 --> 03:14:23.903]  Everything.
[03:14:23.903 --> 03:14:32.267]  And then you've got this arrogant little boy that they give prizes to, like Nobel Prizes and stuff.
[03:14:32.267 --> 03:14:34.669]  This Paul Krugman.
[03:14:34.669 --> 03:14:35.749]  Slugman.
[03:14:35.749 --> 03:14:36.370]  Drugman.
[03:14:37.108 --> 03:14:40.470]  Krugman from the New York Times.
[03:14:40.470 --> 03:14:54.459]  The New York Times calls themselves the paper of record, the toilet paper of record, because all it is is good for is wiping up the crap that spews out of mouths like the Krugman.
[03:14:54.459 --> 03:14:58.881]  Because I'm going back to that video that Alex just played.
[03:14:58.881 --> 03:15:01.543]  This was Krugman's article.
[03:15:01.543 --> 03:15:05.205]  How China lost the COVID war.
[03:15:05.205 --> 03:15:05.886]  This was last
[03:15:07.139 --> 03:15:09.301]  Monday.
[03:15:09.301 --> 03:15:11.063]  Oh, China lost the COVID war.
[03:15:11.063 --> 03:15:18.471]  And he goes on to write, in the first year of the pandemic, strong, even draconian restrictions made sense.
[03:15:20.245 --> 03:15:27.370]  Hey, it wasn't a pandemic, it was a political draconian lockdown.
[03:15:27.370 --> 03:15:40.138]  And they made no sense, just like that guy said, and they've destroyed the lives and livelihoods of billions of people around the planet.
[03:15:40.138 --> 03:15:44.981]  And they're locking this guy, putting him out of business now?
[03:15:44.981 --> 03:15:48.423]  You gotta support info wars because you need to support the truth.
[03:15:49.921 --> 03:15:52.143]  And they're taking it away from us.
[03:15:52.143 --> 03:15:53.584]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:53.584 --> 03:15:57.706]  Stay tuned.
[03:15:57.706 --> 03:16:03.711]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by InfoWars Life.
[03:16:03.711 --> 03:16:07.854]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[03:16:07.854 --> 03:16:15.139]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2 percent per year.
[03:16:15.899 --> 03:16:23.063]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[03:16:23.063 --> 03:16:28.906]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[03:16:28.906 --> 03:16:37.611]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including
[03:16:38.351 --> 03:16:41.715]  Eurycoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[03:16:41.715 --> 03:16:48.001]  Macaru from Peru, horny goatweed from China, and tribulus from India.
[03:16:48.001 --> 03:16:52.105]  Reach your alpha male potential with Alpha Power.
[03:16:52.105 --> 03:16:56.890]  Head to infowarslife.com and secure your bottle today.
[03:16:57.631 --> 03:17:04.655]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[03:17:04.655 --> 03:17:09.857]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[03:17:09.857 --> 03:17:16.881]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[03:17:16.881 --> 03:17:20.043]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.
[03:17:20.943 --> 03:17:25.086]  And you can do that now at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:17:25.086 --> 03:17:31.551]  Help us clear out our stock of bodies' turmeric, vitamin C with zinc, and alpha power.
[03:17:31.551 --> 03:17:38.976]  Turn those shady Federal Reserve notes into the highest quality supplements available, while they still last.
[03:17:38.976 --> 03:17:42.218]  Now, with free shipping.
[03:17:42.218 --> 03:17:48.463]  We thank you for your support, and we wish you a very peaceful, happy, and Merry Christmas.
[03:17:56.974 --> 03:18:08.279]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[03:18:08.279 --> 03:18:10.180]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[03:18:10.180 --> 03:18:11.641]  That's what they want to take away.
[03:18:11.641 --> 03:18:13.182]  Your ability to speak freely.
[03:18:13.182 --> 03:18:14.883]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[03:18:14.883 --> 03:18:16.143]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[03:18:16.143 --> 03:18:17.524]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[03:18:17.964 --> 03:18:22.809]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[03:18:22.809 --> 03:18:25.191]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[03:18:25.191 --> 03:18:27.213]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[03:18:27.213 --> 03:18:34.160]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[03:18:34.781 --> 03:18:40.187]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[03:18:40.187 --> 03:18:49.136]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[03:18:49.136 --> 03:18:55.403]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[03:18:56.829 --> 03:19:17.445]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[03:19:17.965 --> 03:19:31.094]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[03:19:31.094 --> 03:19:39.941]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air.
[03:19:39.941 --> 03:19:46.305]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[03:19:46.445 --> 03:19:47.886]  So, continue to do it.
[03:19:47.886 --> 03:19:50.067]  Go to places like InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:50.067 --> 03:19:52.169]  Go to the places like Save InfoWars.
[03:19:52.169 --> 03:19:57.132]  Continue to keep InfoWars alive, because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[03:20:25.257 --> 03:20:27.439]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:27.439 --> 03:20:30.821]  Yeah, Anna Bonetta, rolled out of bed, went to the police station.
[03:20:30.821 --> 03:20:35.864]  Yeah, when the doctor found out it was all the bad, started an investigation.
[03:20:35.864 --> 03:20:40.788]  And of course, then there was Goodbye Rosie, Queen of Corona.
[03:20:40.788 --> 03:20:42.609]  That's where the coronavirus started.
[03:20:42.609 --> 03:20:44.070]  We could make up anything.
[03:20:44.070 --> 03:20:48.253]  Going back to that clown boy, Grugman, Glugman, Slugman, Drugman.
[03:20:49.424 --> 03:20:56.526]  Arrogant, arrogant, arrogant, arrogant piece of slime from the New York Times, the toilet paper record.
[03:20:56.526 --> 03:21:06.128]  I'm mentioning what they did to that poor guy, locking him down because he refused to obey the COVID laws.
[03:21:06.128 --> 03:21:07.668]  Made up!
[03:21:07.668 --> 03:21:12.089]  Only done on political science, not factual science.
[03:21:12.089 --> 03:21:16.690]  And again, everybody, all of these little low-life scum,
[03:21:18.012 --> 03:21:27.277]  Condemning China for what China is doing with the COVID lockdowns when they did the same thing in America.
[03:21:27.277 --> 03:21:31.118]  We had that little boy over here, that de Blasio.
[03:21:31.118 --> 03:21:33.540]  His real name isn't de Blasio.
[03:21:33.540 --> 03:21:36.261]  It's Warren Williams Jr.
[03:21:36.261 --> 03:21:37.642]  Yeah, Jr.
[03:21:37.642 --> 03:21:38.802]  That's all you are.
[03:21:38.802 --> 03:21:40.243]  You're a junior.
[03:21:40.243 --> 03:21:44.965]  I took my mama's name to get the Italian-American vote.
[03:21:44.965 --> 03:21:46.406]  Rocking down every place.
[03:21:48.297 --> 03:21:50.398]  Little stupid jerk.
[03:21:50.398 --> 03:21:56.859]  These are the stupid jerks that are running and ruining our lives.
[03:21:56.859 --> 03:21:59.500]  Making up crap.
[03:21:59.500 --> 03:22:02.681]  And then putting this guy out of business.
[03:22:02.681 --> 03:22:07.803]  And condemning the Chinese for exactly what the Americans did.
[03:22:07.803 --> 03:22:15.745]  And this, this is the crap spewing out of Krugman's mouth.
[03:22:15.745 --> 03:22:16.185]  You ready?
[03:22:19.286 --> 03:22:29.229]  First, talking about China, autocracy is not, in fact, superior to democracy.
[03:22:29.229 --> 03:22:39.652]  Autocrats can act quickly and decisively, but they can also make huge mistakes, because nobody can tell them when they're wrong.
[03:22:40.470 --> 03:22:45.533]  Hey, like little Andy Cuomo, an autocrat.
[03:22:45.533 --> 03:22:54.359]  Hey, I'm the governor on a slime ball down in Virginia that's putting that guy out of business.
[03:22:54.359 --> 03:22:57.321]  Hey, I'm the mayor.
[03:22:57.321 --> 03:23:07.288]  I'm some little jerk off over there in a city-state near you that'll tell you what to do.
[03:23:07.288 --> 03:23:08.969]  Close down your businesses.
[03:23:09.881 --> 03:23:12.603]  Stands succeed apart.
[03:23:12.603 --> 03:23:14.485]  Can't sit at the bar.
[03:23:14.485 --> 03:23:18.848]  And when you're on an airplane, you don't wear your mask.
[03:23:18.848 --> 03:23:20.429]  Hey, that's not autocracy.
[03:23:20.429 --> 03:23:22.631]  No, because it's democracy.
[03:23:22.631 --> 03:23:26.314]  You can take it off when you're eating and drinking.
[03:23:26.314 --> 03:23:30.798]  Hey, Slimeball!
[03:23:30.798 --> 03:23:32.399]  Who's making this crap up?
[03:23:34.907 --> 03:23:39.970]  I gotta wear it when I'm in the plane, but I can take it off when I'm eating and drinking?
[03:23:39.970 --> 03:23:41.311]  That's right, Salenti!
[03:23:41.311 --> 03:23:47.154]  Hey, wait a minute.
[03:23:47.154 --> 03:23:52.657]  You mean the COVID doesn't know when you're eating and drinking, so it won't bother you?
[03:23:52.657 --> 03:23:55.338]  It knows when you're eating and drinking, so it doesn't like to bother you?
[03:23:55.338 --> 03:23:57.959]  That's right!
[03:23:57.959 --> 03:24:02.582]  Oh yeah, just like when you walk into a restaurant, you gotta wear the mask, but when you sit down, you can take it off?
[03:24:03.248 --> 03:24:08.511]  That's right, because the COVID does not go to table height!
[03:24:08.511 --> 03:24:13.154]  You got that Klumman autocracy?
[03:24:13.154 --> 03:24:16.797]  We got it here in America.
[03:24:16.797 --> 03:24:26.263]  This country's turning, look at the slime balls making up the crap and shoving it down our throat, like that arrogant Gavin Newsom.
[03:24:26.263 --> 03:24:29.385]  Can't go to the beach, can't go to the beach.
[03:24:29.385 --> 03:24:30.886]  Are you talking about China?
[03:24:32.967 --> 03:24:42.934]  Hey, last Tuesday, November 29th, I turned 76 years old.
[03:24:42.934 --> 03:24:46.096]  And it hit me.
[03:24:46.096 --> 03:24:46.857]  76.
[03:24:46.857 --> 03:24:48.478]  You know what?
[03:24:48.478 --> 03:24:52.441]  I'm fighting for the spirit of 76.
[03:24:52.441 --> 03:24:52.461]  1776.
[03:24:52.461 --> 03:24:55.243]  A Declaration of Independence.
[03:24:55.243 --> 03:24:55.463]  Life.
[03:24:55.463 --> 03:24:55.864]  Liberty.
[03:25:02.879 --> 03:25:06.583]  And the pursuit of happiness.
[03:25:06.583 --> 03:25:07.844]  Happiness?
[03:25:07.844 --> 03:25:08.264]  Why?
[03:25:08.264 --> 03:25:09.405]  How dare you?
[03:25:09.405 --> 03:25:12.609]  No happiness allowed!
[03:25:12.609 --> 03:25:14.991]  Get back in your house!
[03:25:14.991 --> 03:25:19.395]  Every week in the Trends Journal, we have a section called the COVID War.
[03:25:19.395 --> 03:25:21.858]  We've been writing it since January 28th, 2020.
[03:25:26.439 --> 03:25:39.770]  That gentleman whose business was destroyed and those tough boys in their cop drag that all of these guys... How come you're not out there doing serious stuff?
[03:25:39.770 --> 03:25:41.292]  Yeah.
[03:25:41.292 --> 03:25:43.854]  That business is destroyed.
[03:25:43.854 --> 03:25:45.936]  Lives destroyed.
[03:25:45.936 --> 03:25:49.078]  Look how tough they are.
[03:25:49.078 --> 03:25:50.539]  Happiness?
[03:25:50.539 --> 03:25:53.242]  No, you're not allowed any happiness.
[03:25:53.242 --> 03:25:54.663]  We'll tell you what to do.
[03:25:56.013 --> 03:26:07.643]  This Klugman, Slugman, Drugman jerk over there and... First, orcocracy is not, in fact, superior to democracy.
[03:26:07.643 --> 03:26:12.266]  Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness has been stolen away from us.
[03:26:12.266 --> 03:26:15.389]  And that's why you need to support InfoWars.
[03:26:17.006 --> 03:26:28.334]  Because they're going to keep stealing it from us, robbing it from us, and these tough little boys that, oh, yeah, they're all there, yeah, we're issuing you with this fine.
[03:26:28.334 --> 03:26:34.438]  How come you're not on the streets getting the people that are causing the crimes?
[03:26:34.438 --> 03:26:36.060]  Oh, oh.
[03:26:36.060 --> 03:26:43.645]  And in what slimeballed Krugman, Jugman, that's been wrong about just about everything he forecast,
[03:26:48.717 --> 03:27:01.207]  Prosecution to the fullest in what's happened to America and a slap on the wrist for the bigs when they get caught robbing and stealing.
[03:27:01.207 --> 03:27:03.549]  Oh, don't believe me?
[03:27:03.549 --> 03:27:08.353]  How about JPMorgan Chase, huh?
[03:27:08.353 --> 03:27:11.855]  Convicted of five felonies.
[03:27:11.855 --> 03:27:13.637]  Convicted.
[03:27:13.637 --> 03:27:16.119]  You don't see Jamie Dimon going to jail.
[03:27:18.426 --> 03:27:19.647]  One after another.
[03:27:19.647 --> 03:27:21.408]  Ah, give them a fine.
[03:27:21.408 --> 03:27:22.209]  They'll be fine.
[03:27:22.209 --> 03:27:23.069]  Just give them a fine.
[03:27:23.069 --> 03:27:24.731]  They're members of the club.
[03:27:24.731 --> 03:27:25.491]  They got caught.
[03:27:25.491 --> 03:27:25.911]  So what?
[03:27:25.911 --> 03:27:28.073]  Take it easy.
[03:27:28.073 --> 03:27:30.435]  Rigging the precious metals market.
[03:27:30.435 --> 03:27:32.676]  Not making it up.
[03:27:32.676 --> 03:27:34.958]  Convicted of felony.
[03:27:34.958 --> 03:27:37.439]  Convicted of five felonies.
[03:27:37.439 --> 03:27:38.580]  They don't go to jail.
[03:27:38.580 --> 03:27:42.163]  Hey, how come you're not locking down JPMorgan Chase?
[03:27:43.922 --> 03:27:45.083]  What's wrong with you, Selenti?
[03:27:45.083 --> 03:27:46.004]  They run the show.
[03:27:46.004 --> 03:27:47.405]  It's the, you know, the banksters.
[03:27:47.405 --> 03:27:53.629]  You got it?
[03:27:53.629 --> 03:27:54.370]  These cops.
[03:27:54.370 --> 03:27:55.110]  How come you're not?
[03:27:55.110 --> 03:27:55.771]  How come you're not?
[03:27:55.771 --> 03:28:00.134]  Well, again, it's prosecution to the fullest.
[03:28:00.134 --> 03:28:06.318]  For we, the little people of Slavelandia.
[03:28:06.318 --> 03:28:12.183]  While the bigs get a free ride of robbing us of our money, our life, our liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:28:13.451 --> 03:28:14.171]  I'm fighting.
[03:28:14.171 --> 03:28:21.354]  That gentleman was right on telling those cops.
[03:28:21.354 --> 03:28:22.415]  What are you doing over here?
[03:28:22.415 --> 03:28:24.335]  You're part of it.
[03:28:24.335 --> 03:28:26.996]  By you doing this, you're part of it.
[03:28:26.996 --> 03:28:31.298]  You're Heil Hitler.
[03:28:31.298 --> 03:28:32.659]  We're going to take a break.
[03:28:32.659 --> 03:28:34.539]  We're going to be back soon.
[03:28:34.539 --> 03:28:38.881]  Remember, everything you can do to support InfoWars, you need to do.
[03:28:40.538 --> 03:28:43.421]  Because this thing's going down fast, it's going down hard.
[03:28:43.421 --> 03:28:46.884]  Remember what I say, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:28:46.884 --> 03:28:50.167]  And when we get back, we're going to talk about the economy failing.
[03:28:50.167 --> 03:28:52.629]  And war is on the near horizon.
[03:28:52.629 --> 03:28:53.470]  So stay tuned.
[03:28:57.586 --> 03:29:09.054]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[03:29:09.054 --> 03:29:13.516]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[03:29:13.516 --> 03:29:17.499]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[03:29:17.499 --> 03:29:21.922]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[03:29:21.922 --> 03:29:23.003]  You see, the sun
[03:29:23.723 --> 03:29:24.043]  We're good
[03:29:47.500 --> 03:29:50.201]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[03:30:04.835 --> 03:30:15.203]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[03:30:15.203 --> 03:30:27.953]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[03:30:28.633 --> 03:30:40.140]  Treatment packages specifically for COVID, post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes, and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[03:30:40.140 --> 03:30:48.324]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health advice.
[03:30:48.324 --> 03:30:56.509]  Come see The Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to The Wellness Company.
[03:30:57.685 --> 03:31:18.315]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[03:31:18.815 --> 03:31:31.946]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[03:31:31.946 --> 03:31:40.793]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air.
[03:31:40.793 --> 03:31:47.238]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[03:31:47.318 --> 03:31:48.759]  So continue to do it.
[03:31:48.759 --> 03:31:50.940]  Go to places like InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:50.940 --> 03:31:53.041]  Go to the places like Save InfoWars.
[03:31:53.041 --> 03:31:57.984]  Continue to keep InfoWars alive, because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[03:31:58.809 --> 03:32:07.632]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:32:07.632 --> 03:32:11.453]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[03:32:11.453 --> 03:32:20.535]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company and they're able to cut our regular shipping costs by up to 50%.
[03:32:20.535 --> 03:32:22.576]  So that means even on orders that are below $50,
[03:32:23.336 --> 03:32:26.778]  You're going to be paying way lower than you were previously.
[03:32:26.778 --> 03:32:28.218]  This is a game changer.
[03:32:28.218 --> 03:32:29.779]  We're so excited about it.
[03:32:29.779 --> 03:32:32.040]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[03:32:32.040 --> 03:32:36.462]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[03:32:36.462 --> 03:32:39.583]  So now, your orders will be shipped even faster.
[03:32:39.583 --> 03:32:42.024]  The same great customer service and more.
[03:32:42.024 --> 03:32:47.747]  So, get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[03:32:48.707 --> 03:32:56.273]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system, lead a healthier life, and keep InfoWars on the air at InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:33:17.519 --> 03:33:21.981]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:21.981 --> 03:33:33.985]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:33:33.985 --> 03:33:35.986]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:35.986 --> 03:33:39.847]  And again, we're in very, very critical times.
[03:33:39.847 --> 03:33:42.288]  World War III has already begun.
[03:33:44.011 --> 03:33:47.434]  You go back to our Trends Journal covers.
[03:33:47.434 --> 03:33:49.555]  COVID war, Ukraine war, world war.
[03:33:49.555 --> 03:33:51.717]  That was two days before Russia invaded.
[03:33:51.717 --> 03:33:54.679]  Again, we're totally opposed to Russia's invasion.
[03:33:54.679 --> 03:33:57.141]  Totally understand why.
[03:33:57.141 --> 03:33:59.983]  As I said, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:33:59.983 --> 03:34:02.385]  And World War III has begun.
[03:34:02.385 --> 03:34:04.266]  World War II.
[03:34:04.266 --> 03:34:08.109]  Oh, followed the Great Depression.
[03:34:08.109 --> 03:34:10.250]  What happened with the dot-com bust?
[03:34:10.250 --> 03:34:13.733]  Oh, the war on terror that changed our lives.
[03:34:15.424 --> 03:34:17.726]  Yep.
[03:34:17.726 --> 03:34:20.768]  And everybody forgot about the dot-com crash.
[03:34:20.768 --> 03:34:25.991]  The Nasdaq was down 66% the day before 9-11.
[03:34:25.991 --> 03:34:30.374]  So, what we're saying is you better prepare, prevail, and prosper.
[03:34:30.374 --> 03:34:36.558]  And Infowars can help you do that with a lot of the products that they sell, and of course with our magazine, The Trends Journal.
[03:34:36.558 --> 03:34:39.701]  You know, we're giving you history before it happens.
[03:34:39.701 --> 03:34:41.822]  We forecast what's going on.
[03:34:41.822 --> 03:34:43.323]  We don't take sides on things.
[03:34:43.323 --> 03:34:44.404]  We're political atheists.
[03:34:45.780 --> 03:34:52.803]  And so going back to the economy, when I went on the air, the Dow was down about 500 points.
[03:34:52.803 --> 03:35:01.907]  And it's down because there's fear that they're going to raise interest rates more than 50 basis points.
[03:35:01.907 --> 03:35:05.109]  So this is from CNBC.
[03:35:05.109 --> 03:35:14.533]  Stocks fell Monday on fears that the Federal Reserve may continue tightening until it steers the economy into a recession.
[03:35:18.117 --> 03:35:19.958]  Wait a minute.
[03:35:19.958 --> 03:35:44.218]  Until it steers the economy into a recession, so it hurts just the small people, as the bigs get bigger and buy up everything, like they did with the housing bust, and all of those firms that started buying homes, and then people can't afford to rent, they'll buy a home and they rent it to them?
[03:35:44.218 --> 03:35:45.459]  That didn't happen before this.
[03:35:47.125 --> 03:35:58.393]  And now the bigs, these big private equity groups and the rest, they control about 30% of the housing that they're buying up.
[03:35:58.393 --> 03:36:02.296]  So put it into a recession and there's no blowback about this?
[03:36:02.296 --> 03:36:04.337]  Let's get this straight everybody.
[03:36:04.337 --> 03:36:10.582]  I know you Krugman, you just spew out crap so you got it wrong.
[03:36:12.009 --> 03:36:28.442]  It had nothing to do with supply chain disruptions and other crap that the mainstream media spews out that brought up the inflation rate.
[03:36:28.442 --> 03:36:34.487]  It's the cheap money backed by nothing and printed on nothing that the government
[03:36:36.016 --> 03:36:42.681]  And the Fed banksters pumped into the economy to keep the money junkies high.
[03:36:42.681 --> 03:36:46.144]  They pump in that monetary methadone.
[03:36:46.144 --> 03:36:51.487]  That's what caused inflation.
[03:36:51.487 --> 03:36:58.993]  Not supply chain disruptions and all the other crap you're shooting out of your mouth.
[03:36:58.993 --> 03:37:01.475]  Oh, but we're going to bring the nation into recession.
[03:37:02.338 --> 03:37:04.699]  So the hell with the little people.
[03:37:04.699 --> 03:37:06.500]  They can rot in hell.
[03:37:06.500 --> 03:37:13.863]  The bigs will get bigger and buy out more, like Alex Jones said.
[03:37:13.863 --> 03:37:17.144]  They closed down all the small businesses.
[03:37:17.144 --> 03:37:21.286]  Hey, but Walmart, you're essential, you know?
[03:37:21.286 --> 03:37:24.227]  Target, you're essential.
[03:37:24.227 --> 03:37:28.228]  But mom and pop, you count for nothing.
[03:37:28.228 --> 03:37:30.209]  You're nothing.
[03:37:30.209 --> 03:37:31.970]  This is America.
[03:37:33.112 --> 03:37:41.836]  A-N-E-R-I-K-A.
[03:37:41.836 --> 03:37:50.139]  Fascism, according to Mussolini, is the merger of state and corporate powers.
[03:37:50.139 --> 03:37:51.560]  Welcome aboard.
[03:37:51.560 --> 03:38:01.044]  To run in an election in America, you better get a lot of money from the bigs.
[03:38:01.983 --> 03:38:06.608]  Yeah, like that little, uh, Beto boy.
[03:38:06.608 --> 03:38:08.249]  Beto boy!
[03:38:08.249 --> 03:38:10.111]  Down in Texas.
[03:38:10.111 --> 03:38:11.092]  A loser!
[03:38:11.092 --> 03:38:14.515]  You lost a hundred million bucks almost, huh?
[03:38:14.515 --> 03:38:17.718]  A hundred million dollars almost to run for governor.
[03:38:17.718 --> 03:38:21.182]  And the other clown over there in Georgia.
[03:38:21.182 --> 03:38:24.625]  Losing, Abrams or whatever his name is.
[03:38:24.625 --> 03:38:26.307]  A hundred million bucks.
[03:38:28.627 --> 03:38:36.454]  And then they make up garbage like the Inflation Reduction Act, talking about fascism.
[03:38:36.454 --> 03:38:43.220]  Hey, we'll give those companies big money to build the plants all the year to make chips.
[03:38:43.220 --> 03:38:50.347]  Yeah, we're going to steal your money and give it to them and we're going to print it up.
[03:38:50.347 --> 03:38:53.429]  Billions, billions and billions.
[03:38:53.429 --> 03:38:55.011]  That's what's bringing inflation up.
[03:38:56.633 --> 03:39:02.457]  And here they admit they're looking to bring the country into recession.
[03:39:02.457 --> 03:39:13.604]  They could care about, they want little business to go out of business, so the New World Order takes over more and more of all the orders coming in.
[03:39:13.604 --> 03:39:16.926]  That's right.
[03:39:16.926 --> 03:39:19.608]  Where's the outrage?
[03:39:19.608 --> 03:39:22.890]  Hey, how about that World Cup, huh?
[03:39:22.890 --> 03:39:23.831]  That's what people talk about.
[03:39:26.619 --> 03:39:34.324]  Anyway, the spirit of 1776, that is what we have to be in.
[03:39:34.324 --> 03:39:38.266]  And the first one, to me, is the fight.
[03:39:38.266 --> 03:39:40.768]  Because we're in the fight for our lives.
[03:39:40.768 --> 03:39:44.630]  And before I get into that, I want to stay on the market.
[03:39:44.630 --> 03:39:49.613]  They raise interest rates 75 basis points.
[03:39:49.613 --> 03:39:54.296]  There's going to be a housing decline, but we don't see a crash.
[03:39:54.296 --> 03:39:54.556]  But it's
[03:39:55.267 --> 03:40:04.455]  The prices go down 20-25%, they went up 40% and they'll bounce back because inflation is going to keep going.
[03:40:04.455 --> 03:40:13.142]  Number two, the biggest crash you're going to see in the economic sector is in commercial offices.
[03:40:13.142 --> 03:40:16.525]  People are not going back to work the way they used to.
[03:40:16.525 --> 03:40:21.289]  So even if they bring it back to a 75% occupancy rate, people going back to work is still down 25%.
[03:40:24.511 --> 03:40:29.895]  And now when interest rates go up, now you've got to pay more on the loans that you have.
[03:40:29.895 --> 03:40:34.298]  And then this goes global, and that's what we do with the Trends Journal, it's global nomic.
[03:40:34.298 --> 03:40:41.203]  All of these emerging markets, they've borrowed money in dollars.
[03:40:41.203 --> 03:40:49.489]  Interest rates go up, the dollar gets stronger, not because the country's so strong, because the other currencies are so weak.
[03:40:49.489 --> 03:40:51.350]  That's why the dollar's strong.
[03:40:51.350 --> 03:40:53.532]  So now they have to pay more on their debt.
[03:40:55.251 --> 03:40:57.573]  What does it mean?
[03:40:57.573 --> 03:40:59.914]  You think you got a refugee crisis now?
[03:40:59.914 --> 03:41:04.198]  Ain't seen anything yet.
[03:41:04.198 --> 03:41:11.983]  You're gonna see demonstrations, riots, civil unrest, across the globe.
[03:41:11.983 --> 03:41:16.286]  As people take to the streets a lack of basic living standards.
[03:41:16.286 --> 03:41:18.928]  Government corruption, crime and violence.
[03:41:18.928 --> 03:41:19.909]  You gonna wanna stay there?
[03:41:19.909 --> 03:41:23.451]  No, you wanna leave.
[03:41:23.451 --> 03:41:23.772]  Now,
[03:41:24.631 --> 03:41:29.653]  Put on top of that all the damage they did with the COVID war.
[03:41:29.653 --> 03:41:32.934]  And the businesses and lives and livelihoods they destroyed.
[03:41:32.934 --> 03:41:38.236]  They haven't come back.
[03:41:38.236 --> 03:41:42.177]  It's a whole different world.
[03:41:42.177 --> 03:41:45.779]  At night up here, I'm 15 minutes away from Woodstock.
[03:41:45.779 --> 03:41:49.380]  10 o'clock at night on a Saturday, dead.
[03:41:49.380 --> 03:41:52.201]  No live, hardly any live bands anymore, hardly anything going on.
[03:41:53.260 --> 03:41:54.600]  The whole mentality's changed.
[03:41:54.600 --> 03:41:59.061]  I have a friend that's been in the restaurant business 45 years.
[03:41:59.061 --> 03:42:01.982]  He said, we're taking reservations at 5.30 at night.
[03:42:01.982 --> 03:42:03.282]  Never happened.
[03:42:03.282 --> 03:42:05.423]  People even start going out until like 6.30, 7.
[03:42:05.423 --> 03:42:15.325]  It's gonna go down big, it's gonna go down quick, and it's gonna go down hard.
[03:42:15.325 --> 03:42:17.365]  So you better prepare, prevail, and prosper.
[03:42:18.624 --> 03:42:26.489]  And we're giving you everything we can with the Trends Journal, TrendsJournal.com to do that, TrendsJournal.com, and so too is Infowars.
[03:42:26.489 --> 03:42:30.051]  I go there every day to see the stories they're putting up, the articles.
[03:42:30.051 --> 03:42:36.916]  They're very important, and they're on trend on so many different things in so many different ways.
[03:42:36.916 --> 03:42:40.338]  So, that's on the stock market front.
[03:42:40.338 --> 03:42:46.322]  And then there's the war, and what that means, and how it's expanding, and how bad it's going to get.
[03:42:47.591 --> 03:42:54.365]  And what these sanctions are doing that are really going to hurt.
[03:42:54.365 --> 03:42:55.528]  We're going to be back in just a bit.
[03:42:57.625 --> 03:43:07.251]  Christmas 2022 is almost here, and we have great products at InfoWarsTore.com that empower your body, your libido, your immune system, that just enrich your life.
[03:43:07.251 --> 03:43:13.135]  So whether it's Vitamin Mineral Fusion, or DNA Force Plus, or Body's Open Tumor Formula, they're all still in stock.
[03:43:13.135 --> 03:43:14.856]  Discount up to 60% with promo code 1776.
[03:43:14.856 --> 03:43:15.296]  And now, finally,
[03:43:17.898 --> 03:43:18.639]  We're good to go.
[03:43:39.040 --> 03:43:39.381]  I think so.
[03:43:57.577 --> 03:44:06.123]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[03:44:06.123 --> 03:44:15.749]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day.
[03:44:15.749 --> 03:44:17.430]  And that's the problem.
[03:44:17.430 --> 03:44:20.192]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[03:44:20.192 --> 03:44:22.954]  They illegally changed state elections.
[03:44:23.854 --> 03:44:29.397]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[03:44:29.397 --> 03:44:31.418]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[03:44:31.418 --> 03:44:35.660]  We are in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[03:44:35.660 --> 03:44:50.787]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question the fact that elections
[03:44:51.949 --> 03:44:53.634]  Shouldn't be run the way they are.
[03:44:53.634 --> 03:44:55.018]  We're not election deniers.
[03:44:55.018 --> 03:44:56.402]  We're election realists.
[03:44:57.836 --> 03:45:06.659]  December 2022 is here, and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at infowarestore.com.
[03:45:06.659 --> 03:45:10.480]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[03:45:10.480 --> 03:45:19.562]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company, and they're able to cut our regular shipping costs by up to 50%.
[03:45:19.562 --> 03:45:21.583]  So that means even on orders that are below $50,
[03:45:22.363 --> 03:45:25.806]  You're going to be paying way lower than you were previously.
[03:45:25.806 --> 03:45:27.267]  This is a game changer.
[03:45:27.267 --> 03:45:28.788]  We're so excited about it.
[03:45:28.788 --> 03:45:31.070]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[03:45:31.070 --> 03:45:35.493]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[03:45:35.493 --> 03:45:38.615]  So now, your orders will be shipped even faster.
[03:45:38.615 --> 03:45:41.057]  The same great customer service and more.
[03:45:41.057 --> 03:45:46.781]  So, get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at InfowarsStore.com right now.
[03:45:47.722 --> 03:45:55.289]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system, lead a healthier life, and keep InfoWars on the air at InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:45:57.674 --> 03:46:08.987]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[03:46:08.987 --> 03:46:10.889]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[03:46:10.889 --> 03:46:12.351]  That's what they want to take away.
[03:46:12.351 --> 03:46:13.853]  Your ability to speak freely.
[03:46:13.853 --> 03:46:15.575]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[03:46:15.575 --> 03:46:16.856]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[03:46:16.856 --> 03:46:18.258]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[03:46:18.658 --> 03:46:23.504]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[03:46:23.504 --> 03:46:25.907]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[03:46:25.907 --> 03:46:27.909]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[03:46:27.909 --> 03:46:34.877]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet about East America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[03:46:35.498 --> 03:46:40.881]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[03:46:40.881 --> 03:46:49.845]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[03:46:49.845 --> 03:46:58.350]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[03:46:58.350 --> 03:47:04.233]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:19.142 --> 03:47:22.545]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.545 --> 03:47:28.889]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:47:28.889 --> 03:47:31.992]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:31.992 --> 03:47:35.915]  And as I've been saying, you know, now is the time.
[03:47:35.915 --> 03:47:38.256]  United we stand, divided we die.
[03:47:38.256 --> 03:47:43.640]  And that's the level we're at right now.
[03:47:43.640 --> 03:47:45.862]  And censorship, who would have ever believed this?
[03:47:45.862 --> 03:47:47.924]  You know, when they began the whole
[03:47:48.874 --> 03:47:51.416]  Internet revolution.
[03:47:51.416 --> 03:47:53.777]  It was all about being free.
[03:47:53.777 --> 03:47:56.599]  Oh, that's what this whole Internet's going to be.
[03:47:56.599 --> 03:47:59.341]  That's going back to the early 90s.
[03:47:59.341 --> 03:48:03.083]  And now it's, again, the bigs control everything.
[03:48:03.083 --> 03:48:06.366]  And that's why you need to support InfoWars.
[03:48:06.366 --> 03:48:10.348]  And you do so by buying their great products.
[03:48:10.348 --> 03:48:17.553]  And the stuff they have, they're selling this out fast, with the Christmas season coming in, and have this mega blowout sale.

[03:48:57.592 --> 03:48:59.172]  Vitamin D3 Gummies.
[03:48:59.172 --> 03:49:03.513]  And what Alex Jones was saying about the D3, very important.
[03:49:03.513 --> 03:49:05.414]  And the Brain Force Ultra.
[03:49:06.911 --> 03:49:08.292]  All 50% off.

[03:50:08.217 --> 03:50:08.817]  All right.
[03:50:08.817 --> 03:50:13.058]  As I said, I like my super male vitality.
[03:50:13.058 --> 03:50:16.639]  Spirit of 1776.
[03:50:16.639 --> 03:50:26.782]  Got to boogie before the lights go out because tomorrow is iffy and that super male vitality keeps that boogie going, you know?
[03:50:26.782 --> 03:50:30.223]  There's an article that just came out, you know, reading this morning.
[03:50:30.223 --> 03:50:31.824]  The Cartoon News Network, CNN.
[03:50:33.337 --> 03:50:35.499]  Again, this is why you subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[03:50:35.499 --> 03:50:37.120]  Just put worthless junk out there.
[03:50:37.120 --> 03:50:38.641]  Same thing with the New York Times.
[03:50:38.641 --> 03:50:43.926]  I gotta watch and listen to this stuff so I can see what the masses are doing.
[03:50:43.926 --> 03:50:47.328]  I get the New York Times delivered every day.
[03:50:47.328 --> 03:50:50.951]  Costs like three bucks a day, five dollars, six dollars on the weekend.
[03:50:50.951 --> 03:50:56.596]  I'm lucky to get an article out of there that's trend worthy, that has vital information that I could use.
[03:50:56.596 --> 03:50:59.338]  But I want to see what else they're saying.
[03:50:59.338 --> 03:51:02.461]  So this is the story, the top story, in the
[03:51:04.821 --> 03:51:06.922]  On the Cartoon News Network.
[03:51:06.922 --> 03:51:13.645]  Dementia risks may increase if you're eating these foods, study says.
[03:51:13.645 --> 03:51:19.928]  Again, before I go into that, again, it goes back to the products that Infowars is selling and why you need so many of them.
[03:51:19.928 --> 03:51:23.930]  This is how they begin it.
[03:51:23.930 --> 03:51:29.893]  Sandy Lamotte, or Lamotte, I don't know, L-O-M-O-T-T-E.
[03:51:29.893 --> 03:51:30.693]  Ready?
[03:51:30.693 --> 03:51:31.853]  Quote.
[03:51:31.853 --> 03:51:32.874]  We all eat them.
[03:51:34.628 --> 03:51:35.188]  Wait a minute.
[03:51:35.188 --> 03:51:37.830]  Wait a minute.
[03:51:37.830 --> 03:51:40.072]  This is not journalism.
[03:51:40.072 --> 03:51:46.217]  Let's start with the first three, four words.
[03:51:46.217 --> 03:51:46.997]  We.
[03:51:46.997 --> 03:51:48.678]  Not we.
[03:51:48.678 --> 03:51:50.179]  Not we.
[03:51:50.179 --> 03:51:55.723]  People who eat crap.
[03:51:55.723 --> 03:51:57.425]  We all eat them.
[03:51:57.425 --> 03:52:00.187]  Ultra processed foods.
[03:52:00.187 --> 03:52:01.808]  Such as frozen pizza.
[03:52:02.919 --> 03:52:09.924]  And ready-to-eat meals make our busy lives much easier.
[03:52:09.924 --> 03:52:12.325]  How stupid can you be?
[03:52:12.325 --> 03:52:16.748]  How stupid can you be?
[03:52:16.748 --> 03:52:23.112]  Eat crap!
[03:52:23.112 --> 03:52:26.094]  But what's the headline?
[03:52:26.094 --> 03:52:30.937]  Dementia risks may increase if you're eating these foods and you say,
[03:52:32.543 --> 03:52:35.964]  Ready to eat meals, make our busy lives easy.
[03:52:35.964 --> 03:52:38.385]  Oh, people were never busy before.
[03:52:38.385 --> 03:52:39.566]  No, no, no.
[03:52:39.566 --> 03:52:40.386]  No, only now.
[03:52:40.386 --> 03:52:42.727]  And you ready?
[03:52:42.727 --> 03:52:47.689]  Besides, they are just darn tasty.
[03:52:47.689 --> 03:52:49.570]  Darn tasty.
[03:52:49.570 --> 03:52:51.691]  You're darn stupid.
[03:52:51.691 --> 03:52:59.154]  She goes on to say about who is insusceptible.
[03:53:04.181 --> 03:53:06.023]  The hot dogs?
[03:53:06.023 --> 03:53:09.005]  Cookies, cakes, candy, doughnuts, ice cream.
[03:53:09.005 --> 03:53:13.669]  And again, ultra-processes such as frozen pizza, eh?
[03:53:13.669 --> 03:53:27.000]  There's no way in the world that a Napolitano, born in the Bronx, would eat this frozen stuff that you call pizza.
[03:53:27.000 --> 03:53:29.302]  Pizza head.
[03:53:29.302 --> 03:53:31.424]  This is the way they sell this stuff.
[03:53:32.222 --> 03:53:37.084]  And then you go on to read this.
[03:53:37.084 --> 03:53:59.993]  58% of the calories consumed by United States citizens, 56.8% of the calories consumed by British citizens, and 48% of the calories consumed by Canadians, come from ultra-processed foods, according to the study.
[03:53:59.993 --> 03:54:01.654]  Ultra-processed crap!
[03:54:04.068 --> 03:54:08.871]  To me, when they nuked the nuclear family, that was the end.
[03:54:08.871 --> 03:54:15.494]  40% of Americans are obese.
[03:54:15.494 --> 03:54:18.016]  My mother, may her soul rest in peace, has seven kids.
[03:54:18.016 --> 03:54:20.417]  She's home all day cooking.
[03:54:20.417 --> 03:54:22.098]  Doesn't help, busy working.
[03:54:22.098 --> 03:54:24.860]  No, she's raising the family.
[03:54:24.860 --> 03:54:32.704]  Rather than sending us to a daycare center with other little strangers and feeding us crap.
[03:54:33.493 --> 03:54:36.394]  And learn to eat crap all our lives.
[03:54:36.394 --> 03:54:45.115]  And then say you're so damn stupid that you're too busy to eat fine food?
[03:54:45.115 --> 03:54:52.917]  That's one of the things, by the way, that's going to be the spirit of 1776.
[03:54:52.917 --> 03:54:55.457]  Dine fine.
[03:54:55.457 --> 03:54:56.137]  Yep.
[03:54:56.137 --> 03:54:57.557]  You do it at home.
[03:54:57.557 --> 03:54:59.018]  Oh, you can't afford to cook.
[03:54:59.018 --> 03:55:00.318]  I can make resort, though.
[03:55:01.573 --> 03:55:08.596]  Buy the best, the best risotto, best rice.
[03:55:08.596 --> 03:55:14.899]  Feed six people for under ten dollars.
[03:55:14.899 --> 03:55:18.381]  And mwah!
[03:55:18.381 --> 03:55:22.503]  Because then they have another story that's out making the news.
[03:55:22.503 --> 03:55:23.763]  Money where your mouth is?
[03:55:23.763 --> 03:55:27.625]  Paying obese people cash to lose weight doubles their rate.
[03:55:27.625 --> 03:55:28.966]  A fat loss study shows.
[03:55:30.106 --> 03:55:32.868]  Paying obese people who lose weight doubles their rate of fat loss.
[03:55:32.868 --> 03:55:34.028]  Ba-ba-ba-ba.
[03:55:34.028 --> 03:55:34.889]  Research is test.
[03:55:34.889 --> 03:55:36.270]  Ba-ba-ba-ba.
[03:55:36.270 --> 03:55:38.831]  Again, pay them.
[03:55:38.831 --> 03:55:40.672]  You got it backwards.
[03:55:40.672 --> 03:55:43.494]  If I'm elected, I want a fat tax.
[03:55:43.494 --> 03:55:46.015]  The more you weigh, the more you pay.
[03:55:46.015 --> 03:55:55.441]  I don't want to pay for your being too busy to cook good food and eat crap.
[03:55:55.441 --> 03:55:59.043]  Because you're driving up all the bills that cost
[03:55:59.986 --> 03:56:01.426]  The healthcare.
[03:56:01.426 --> 03:56:12.990]  Because 70% of Americans are overweight and 42% obese.
[03:56:12.990 --> 03:56:15.811]  So, the more you weigh, the more you pay.
[03:56:15.811 --> 03:56:19.692]  Oh, and as you lose weight, do the opposite.
[03:56:19.692 --> 03:56:21.273]  Paying obese people cash?
[03:56:21.273 --> 03:56:22.893]  No, you can pay less.
[03:56:22.893 --> 03:56:23.293]  Yeah.
[03:56:23.293 --> 03:56:24.494]  Oh, you'll be fine.
[03:56:24.494 --> 03:56:26.234]  You'll be happy and healthy.
[03:56:26.234 --> 03:56:27.695]  Everything will be great.
[03:56:27.695 --> 03:56:28.735]  And I gotta pay for this?
[03:56:29.662 --> 03:56:33.684]  I gotta pay for this?
[03:56:33.684 --> 03:56:37.545]  Yep.
[03:56:37.545 --> 03:56:40.166]  And again, goes back, all things are connected.
[03:56:40.166 --> 03:56:45.829]  The products they give you at InfoWars, they're very good for your health.
[03:56:45.829 --> 03:56:49.290]  So that's one of the things that we're going to be talking about a lot.
[03:56:49.290 --> 03:56:51.011]  You better get in good shape.
[03:56:51.011 --> 03:56:56.393]  And that gentleman boy whose place is getting locked down for disobeying the
[03:56:57.990 --> 03:57:01.913]  Chinese rules, the Chinese way you must obey on COVID lockdowns.
[03:57:01.913 --> 03:57:04.075]  He said it strong.
[03:57:04.075 --> 03:57:06.456]  It's up to everybody to do something.
[03:57:06.456 --> 03:57:08.498]  Don't complain.
[03:57:08.498 --> 03:57:10.059]  Don't complain.
[03:57:10.059 --> 03:57:10.820]  Do something.
[03:57:10.820 --> 03:57:12.981]  Whatever you do.
[03:57:12.981 --> 03:57:14.923]  Support InfoWars.
[03:57:14.923 --> 03:57:17.325]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:57:17.325 --> 03:57:20.227]  My movement to occupy peace.
[03:57:20.227 --> 03:57:20.927]  Peace on Earth.
[03:57:20.927 --> 03:57:21.768]  Goodwill to all.
[03:57:22.671 --> 03:57:24.132]  And the Trends Journal.
[03:57:24.132 --> 03:57:26.834]  The only... no magazine in the world like it.
[03:57:26.834 --> 03:57:29.416]  About 150 pages a week.
[03:57:29.416 --> 03:57:31.358]  No ads.
[03:57:31.358 --> 03:57:34.120]  And you read what you want.
[03:57:34.120 --> 03:57:36.061]  Because World War III's begun.
[03:57:36.061 --> 03:57:40.225]  And if we don't have peace, it's gonna be hell on Earth.
[03:57:40.225 --> 03:57:43.227]  So remember, support InfoWars.
[03:57:43.227 --> 03:57:44.908]  See you next week.
[03:57:44.908 --> 03:57:45.749]  And do what you can do.
[03:57:47.188 --> 03:57:54.173]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[03:57:54.173 --> 03:57:59.377]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[03:57:59.377 --> 03:58:06.422]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[03:58:06.422 --> 03:58:09.585]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.
[03:58:10.445 --> 03:58:14.606]  And you can do that now at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:58:14.606 --> 03:58:21.068]  Help us clear out our stock of bodies' turmeric, vitamin C with zinc, and alpha power.
[03:58:21.068 --> 03:58:28.490]  Turn those shady Federal Reserve notes into the highest quality supplements available, while they still last.
[03:58:28.490 --> 03:58:31.711]  Now, with free shipping.
[03:58:31.711 --> 03:58:33.992]  We thank you for your support.
[03:58:33.992 --> 03:58:37.953]  And we wish you a very peaceful, happy, and Merry Christmas.
[03:58:47.964 --> 03:58:52.849]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[03:58:52.849 --> 03:58:59.254]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[03:58:59.254 --> 03:59:04.399]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[03:59:04.399 --> 03:59:06.101]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[03:59:06.101 --> 03:59:07.522]  Yes, I've persevered.
[03:59:07.522 --> 03:59:12.527]  But the listeners and viewers who support Infowars are the real reason we've had the success.
[03:59:13.227 --> 03:59:18.671]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[03:59:18.671 --> 03:59:22.994]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[03:59:22.994 --> 03:59:32.021]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[03:59:32.021 --> 03:59:33.562]  God bless you all.
[03:59:33.562 --> 03:59:34.623]  I salute you.
[03:59:34.623 --> 03:59:35.644]  I thank you.
[03:59:35.644 --> 03:59:41.288]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[03:59:41.668 --> 03:59:43.069]  The fight is my fight.
[03:59:43.069 --> 03:59:43.690]  It's your fight.
[03:59:43.690 --> 03:59:44.430]  It's our fight.
[03:59:44.430 --> 03:59:50.394]  God bless you all.
[03:59:50.394 --> 03:59:54.297]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
