[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:03.871]  The United States and NATO have surrounded Russia.
[00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:13.315]  Eight years ago, they overthrew an elected government in Ukraine and began combat operations against Russian-held areas.
[00:00:15.457 --> 00:00:19.819]  In February of this year, on the 24th, the Russians invaded those areas.
[00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:24.501]  They've now annexed about 10% of the eastern area of the nation.
[00:00:25.976 --> 00:00:32.662]  Zelensky that we know of has had over 80 billion dollars just since late February pumped into the country.
[00:00:32.702 --> 00:00:39.527]  Much of it is admitted to have been laundered back to the deep state in Europe and the United States.
[00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:43.450]  Zelensky's getting all these high-tech weapons, more and more heavy weapons.
[00:00:45.692 --> 00:00:47.754]  He's demanded aircraft, you name it.
[00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:54.760]  He's got missiles that can be fired and travel up to 100 miles into Russia.
[00:00:57.426 --> 00:01:02.050]  And now, Zelensky came out yesterday, the full speech is on Infowars.com.
[00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:07.955]  Breaking, Zelensky says NATO must, quote, launch preemptive strikes on Russia.
[00:01:08.496 --> 00:01:18.084]  Preemptive strikes are needed so that they know what awaits them if they use nuclear weapons, Zelensky told the Lowy Institute on Thursday.
[00:01:23.027 --> 00:01:27.432]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:29.792]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:29.792 --> 00:01:48.792]  [Music]
[00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:53.792]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:58.852]  My mission for 28 years has been to fire the flare.
[00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:03.834]  To be Paul Revere.
[00:02:03.854 --> 00:02:03.834]  2.0.
[00:02:08.415 --> 00:02:10.676]  And we've had more success than I ever imagined.
[00:02:11.576 --> 00:02:11.996]  Together.
[00:02:13.037 --> 00:02:13.957]  Thanks to what we've done.
[00:02:15.057 --> 00:02:16.438]  We've done it the American way.
[00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:27.033]  And now we stand at the precipice of the great struggle against the New World Order.
[00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:37.179]  And thanks to your actions and my actions, humanity is awakening and we have a fighting chance.
[00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:50.647]  It's Friday, October 7th, 2022, and we've got one hell of a broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:54.226]  Mark Passio.
[00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:56.130]  I've known about Mark for seven, eight years.
[00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.071]  Really smart guy.
[00:02:58.974 --> 00:03:00.577]  And he's become even more prominent.
[00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:03.762]  I have people come up to me on the street constantly.
[00:03:03.802 --> 00:03:05.044]  I mean, four or five times a week.
[00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:08.362]  Talking about Mark Passio, and my wife's a huge fan.
[00:03:08.382 --> 00:03:15.224]  She watches and listens to all of his shows, and she's really helped her expand her understanding of things, which I really like.
[00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:16.305]  You know, I've helped her some too.
[00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:16.945]  She's helped me.
[00:03:17.525 --> 00:03:18.245]  She's really excited.
[00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:20.186]  He's on in the second hour today.
[00:03:20.206 --> 00:03:29.009]  I hope to do some long two, three hour presentations with him in the future on Saturdays and Sundays as we move into doing more and more podcasting style, old school that we helped pioneer.
[00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:36.573]   And then Steve Quayle on the global threat of nuclear war and Cyber attack and just everything that he's been predicting.
[00:03:37.654 --> 00:03:38.495]  Talk about an original.
[00:03:39.796 --> 00:03:40.276]  Oh, gee.
[00:03:42.217 --> 00:03:48.482]  This guy was way ahead of his time, even more than I've been or even William Cooper or anybody out there.
[00:03:48.502 --> 00:03:49.443]  I mean, I would hear quail.
[00:03:50.904 --> 00:03:51.625]  I discovered quail.
[00:03:53.235 --> 00:03:58.138]  30 years ago, before I even got on air, and I thought, this guy's really well-spoken, but he's out there.
[00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:09.366]  Human-animal hybrids, weather weapons, forced injections, and you look back 30 years, and there's dozens of best-selling books, and it's just ridiculous how right he was.
[00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:17.426]  And now, unfortunately, he's being completely vindicated because it's all coming true, exactly as he said it would.
[00:04:17.446 --> 00:04:18.387]  Steve Quill, third hour.
[00:04:18.487 --> 00:04:24.791]  And then, of course, great historian and researcher, Jay Dyer, in the fourth hour, as he does every Friday in the fourth hour.
[00:04:26.412 --> 00:04:36.338]  Now, we're going to go to break and come back and get in the situation with Zelensky calling for preemptive strikes on Russia, on the homeland of Russia, that would cause World War III.
[00:04:36.778 --> 00:04:37.659]  Just totally insane.
[00:04:38.824 --> 00:04:39.444]  We've got that.
[00:04:39.504 --> 00:04:41.325]  We've got Biden saying we're on the verge of Armageddon.
[00:04:41.365 --> 00:04:42.145]  That's all coming up.
[00:04:42.946 --> 00:04:46.527]  And we're not going to talk much today about the jury that's out in the show trial in Connecticut.
[00:04:47.147 --> 00:04:49.728]  I've got notes from my lawyer about what they asked for.
[00:04:49.808 --> 00:04:50.829]  I said $7 million.
[00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:52.589]  I miscalculated what he told me over the phone.
[00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.151]  They asked the jury for $8.25 billion.
[00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:59.512]  Might as well ask for $80 quadrillion.
[00:05:01.773 --> 00:05:03.093]  What a bunch of ambulance chasers.
[00:05:03.113 --> 00:05:03.674]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:03.694 --> 00:05:04.094]  Stay with us.
[00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.533]  It's Friday, October 7th, 2022.
[00:05:10.113 --> 00:05:11.154]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:05:13.476 --> 00:05:20.803]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have entered the Twilight Zone officially on so many fronts.
[00:05:21.543 --> 00:05:22.945]  Let me tell you what's coming up today.
[00:05:24.474 --> 00:05:33.218]  Zelensky, who was elected but has now arrested all his political opposition, even outlawed liberal parties that are anti-Russia.
[00:05:33.338 --> 00:05:34.718]  He says only one party allowed.
[00:05:34.738 --> 00:05:38.880]  He's taken over all radio, TV, and print under his control.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.641]  He set up death camps.
[00:05:42.182 --> 00:05:45.544]  He called in a speech yesterday that the media first said was a deep fake.
[00:05:45.604 --> 00:05:46.765]  No, they confirm it's him now.
[00:05:47.285 --> 00:05:48.006]  Now they're defending it.
[00:05:48.566 --> 00:05:54.290]  For the United States and NATO to start preemptively attacking targets inside Russia.
[00:05:56.191 --> 00:06:01.955]  To quote, preclude them and deter them from escalating the war.
[00:06:02.875 --> 00:06:08.359]  Okay, so attack Russia proper, which is a complete open act of war.
[00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.381]  Under international law, Russia could then nuke us.
[00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:16.819]  I mean, this guy wants Armageddon.
[00:06:19.301 --> 00:06:25.745]  And on the heels of that, the article's up on InfoWars.com, Biden told a bunch of Democrats at a fundraiser, who reportedly loved it.
[00:06:26.146 --> 00:06:28.267]  Hell, they're all over the news saying nuclear war is survivable.
[00:06:28.728 --> 00:06:34.111]  Biden warns of nuclear Armageddon, says the world's in more danger than even the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:06:35.493 --> 00:06:37.114]  And I agree with that statement.
[00:06:38.475 --> 00:06:42.798]  I mean, that's the first big story we're going to get to next segment.
[00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:46.429]  The U.S.
[00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:53.857]  is piling up an anti-radiation drug that doesn't let you bleed out as easily when your cells dissolve, but you still die.
[00:06:55.358 --> 00:06:56.880]  But I guess it won't be as gruesome looking.
[00:06:57.761 --> 00:07:03.406]  That's being given to the troops and government operatives, not just in Europe, but also in the United States.
[00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:06.850]  They're also stocking up on potassium iodide pills.
[00:07:08.066 --> 00:07:14.930]  Which do protect you from a lot of the radiation that'll precipitate out into the thyroid.
[00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:18.893]  But if you have a good enough iodine in the thyroid, it can't get in there.
[00:07:19.974 --> 00:07:23.176]  That's why we hammer and push X2 and X3 constantly.
[00:07:23.596 --> 00:07:27.378]  Imagine if it protects your thyroid from radioactive isotopes.
[00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:30.240]  Imagine what else iodine does.
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.261]  Well, it's essential.
[00:07:32.482 --> 00:07:34.043]  That means you die without it.
[00:07:34.103 --> 00:07:36.084]  Like you die without water in four or five days.
[00:07:36.324 --> 00:07:37.385]  You die without food in a month.
[00:07:39.335 --> 00:07:48.680]  You die without iodine by the different diseases and things you get and degeneration in about four or five months with no iodine.
[00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:50.201]  It's essential.
[00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:50.601]  Look it up.
[00:07:51.682 --> 00:07:54.663]  So I'm not selling X2 and X3 for radiation protection.
[00:07:55.264 --> 00:07:56.945]  It only protects you from some isotopes.
[00:07:57.765 --> 00:08:02.888]  I'm selling it because it's essential and it's awesome and we've got the best at infowarestore.com.
[00:08:02.908 --> 00:08:08.351]  The reason I raise this is we got a big shipment of it in and I've been selling it for 50% off.
[00:08:09.278 --> 00:08:11.379]  But it looks like it's going to sell out in like a week at the current rate.
[00:08:11.739 --> 00:08:15.200]  I'm keeping it 50% off, even though it's going to sell out.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.621]  X3, all three of the good types of iodine you need.
[00:08:18.941 --> 00:08:27.423]  We are not going to raise the price like a lot of other folks are raising the price on ingestible, high quality, nutraceutical iodine.
[00:08:27.443 --> 00:08:28.523]  We've got the best out there.
[00:08:28.563 --> 00:08:31.964]  We are not going to raise the price.
[00:08:32.384 --> 00:08:36.125]  Stamina, libido, energy, focus.
[00:08:36.465 --> 00:08:38.906]  It's critical in all electrochemical activity.
[00:08:40.843 --> 00:08:41.283]  In the body.
[00:08:41.363 --> 00:08:42.564]  We have the other big sale going.
[00:08:42.664 --> 00:08:46.206]  Everything is 40-50% off on Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:08:46.266 --> 00:08:47.047]  Finally back in stock.
[00:08:47.067 --> 00:08:48.348]  So good for your immune system and everything else.
[00:08:48.388 --> 00:08:48.848]  Tastes great.
[00:08:48.868 --> 00:08:49.789]  All the vitamins, all the minerals.
[00:08:50.549 --> 00:08:51.049]  Back in stock.
[00:08:51.089 --> 00:08:51.169]  50% off.
[00:08:51.189 --> 00:08:55.992]  Part of the InfoWars Super Sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:08:56.292 --> 00:08:58.174]  Keep us on the air and be healthy at the same time.
[00:08:58.534 --> 00:08:59.554]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:08:59.995 --> 00:09:00.115]  Now...
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:09.487]  We're going to get into all this other news on Ukraine and more when we come back, as I said, and Biden continuing to block pipelines while saying we got our oil now from Venezuela.
[00:09:09.828 --> 00:09:10.709]  True sabotage.
[00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:18.836]  But the first thing I want to hit is when we come in at the bottom of the hour after I cover Russia.
[00:09:19.938 --> 00:09:31.824]  I'm going to get into the admissions and mainline science everywhere now that the shots are erasing your immune systems, attacking your entire cardiovascular system, your brain, your heart, your lungs, all your blood vessels, and killing people en masse.
[00:09:32.265 --> 00:09:41.210]  And I aired this report yesterday, but it's so important I'm going to air it again first, before we come back, because this is the number one issue, the chemical attack we're under, the biological attack.
[00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:41.750]  Here's the report.
[00:09:43.709 --> 00:09:45.330]  New vaccine with a new approach.
[00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:50.334]  For most Americans, that means one COVID-19 shot once a year, each fall.
[00:09:50.914 --> 00:09:52.695]  If it sounds familiar, it's because it is.
[00:09:52.875 --> 00:09:55.657]  The White House has been comparing it to the annual flu shot.
[00:09:56.197 --> 00:10:00.560]  Now, more than 200 million people are eligible to get a booster from Pfizer and Moderna.
[00:10:01.061 --> 00:10:04.223]  But questions remain over how many actually will get it.
[00:10:04.483 --> 00:10:09.945]  They intended to never stop the lockdowns in Australia, Canada, Europe, you name it.
[00:10:10.406 --> 00:10:13.387]  The country's zero COVID strategy came at a cost.
[00:10:14.107 --> 00:10:17.509]  Melbourne, capital of Victoria State, had six lockdowns.
[00:10:18.049 --> 00:10:22.991]  Only those who've received the jab are allowed to visit restaurants, gyms and most stores.
[00:10:23.571 --> 00:10:27.474]  People's freedoms have been taken away.
[00:10:27.514 --> 00:10:29.675]  Some people have willingly thrown it away.
[00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:31.796]  Very restrictive on movement and everything.
[00:10:31.836 --> 00:10:34.798]  It's pretty much like an open-air prison here in Australia.
[00:10:35.219 --> 00:10:45.705]  But I said in December, if I could metaphysically, intellectually, economically, culturally see it, I said, we've won this round of the fight, but barely.
[00:10:46.005 --> 00:10:47.967]  We're bloodied, but we're awake now.
[00:10:51.657 --> 00:10:59.825]  I see already that it's checkmate.
[00:10:59.865 --> 00:11:10.275]  The only question that's still a variable is how much carnage and what will be the body count of the innocent until we get to that point.
[00:11:10.575 --> 00:11:19.499]   The numbers mirror Israel, they mirror Europe, they mirror Areas of Asia that keep the statistics and show it.
[00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:25.903]  Taiwan, the number of people dying after their COVID vaccination is exceeding the number of deaths from the virus itself.
[00:11:26.224 --> 00:11:30.407]  And if you look, the peak of taking the poison shots was in December of 2021.
[00:11:30.526 --> 00:11:37.526]  of 2021. Since then, there is a 99% rejection. 99.
[00:11:37.526 --> 00:11:42.526]   By late May, there will be enough vaccine for every American who wants one.
[00:11:43.046 --> 00:11:44.787]  The problem is, millions don't.
[00:11:45.148 --> 00:11:48.210]  I'm not getting the vaccine because I'm honestly not scared of the virus.
[00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.812]  I don't trust the vaccine at all.
[00:11:52.092 --> 00:11:55.534]  Polls suggest a large number of Americans will refuse a vaccine.
[00:11:56.034 --> 00:12:00.037]  Most of them are Republicans, supporters of former President Donald Trump.
[00:12:00.397 --> 00:12:05.680]   How some groups would not want to do it for reasons That I just don't understand.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.041]  Even if it doesn't prevent you from getting COVID, I'm double boosted.
[00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:11.242]  I got it myself here just the last week or so.
[00:12:12.463 --> 00:12:14.504]  It makes the symptoms a lot less severe.
[00:12:14.524 --> 00:12:16.025]  It gets you back on duty.
[00:12:16.285 --> 00:12:22.968]  A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found 29% of the healthcare workers questioned likely would not get the vaccine.
[00:12:23.365 --> 00:12:25.507]  Why did you decide to put your livelihood on the line?
[00:12:25.767 --> 00:12:38.398]  I felt that what they were doing, what they have done, is they've basically held for ransom your health insurance, your benefits, your livelihood, your career in some cases.
[00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:42.061]  So they've gone from having a helpless population to believe every word they were saying.
[00:12:42.964 --> 00:12:47.227]  And massive uptake of this garbage that erases your immune system and doesn't protect you.
[00:12:47.667 --> 00:12:49.909]  And now the CDC is saying, oh, we made big mistakes.
[00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:50.750]  It doesn't protect you.
[00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.871]  We lied to you, but it was for your own good.
[00:12:53.271 --> 00:12:55.953]  We made some pretty public mistakes and we need to own them.
[00:12:56.233 --> 00:13:01.577]  The CDC says the review found the agency's COVID guidance was confusing and overwhelming.
[00:13:01.717 --> 00:13:05.760]  We have a CDC document from 2000 and others where they said it isn't going to work.
[00:13:06.881 --> 00:13:12.405]  And it's going to cause massive heart attacks, heart swelling, blood clots, infertility, strokes.
[00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:19.451]  I'm one of the few people along with my 3,500 experts who have looked at the Pfizer documents.
[00:13:19.491 --> 00:13:23.373]  And I can tell you, they knew from a month after the rollout that they did not work.
[00:13:23.713 --> 00:13:31.677]  So the reason I say mass murder with such calmness is that if, and not only that, the FDA knew, because at the bottom of these documents it says FDA confidential.
[00:13:31.937 --> 00:13:36.319]  The FDA has custody of these 50,000 documents that Pfizer was forced to reveal.
[00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:38.640]  So they knew that they didn't work.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.021]  They knew three months in that 1,200 people were dead.
[00:13:42.602 --> 00:13:44.843]  99 plus percent reduction in people taking it.
[00:13:44.863 --> 00:13:46.584]  Now what happens when 99% say no?
[00:13:46.403 --> 00:13:51.364]   We knew in April of last year that children's hearts were being damaged a week after the injection,
[00:13:51.364 --> 00:13:52.683]  and they kept going.
[00:13:52.683 --> 00:13:57.682]  99 plus percent reduction in people taking it.
[00:13:57.682 --> 00:14:01.923]  Now what happens when 99% say no?
[00:14:01.923 --> 00:14:10.602]   All the intimidation, all the threats that people been under in healthcare and government
[00:14:10.602 --> 00:14:15.763]   and the military being tortured with this and seeing their friends and family get sick and die.
[00:14:15.356 --> 00:14:16.217]  They say, you know what?
[00:14:16.297 --> 00:14:16.977]  Screw you.
[00:14:17.037 --> 00:14:18.117]  Everybody's on my side.
[00:14:18.137 --> 00:14:20.597]  And you have that tipping point.
[00:14:21.657 --> 00:14:22.558]  That turning point.
[00:14:23.698 --> 00:14:26.718]  This is spectacularly positive news.
[00:14:27.238 --> 00:14:32.459]  And this information from this show needs to be clipped out and needs to be spread to the four winds.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.500]  Because this is victory.
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:45.000]  The United States and NATO have surrounded Russia.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:55.000]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:14:46.162 --> 00:14:54.429]  Eight years ago, they overthrew an elected government in Ukraine and began combat operations against Russian-held areas.
[00:14:56.571 --> 00:15:00.935]  In February of this year, on the 24th, the Russians invaded those areas.
[00:15:00.955 --> 00:15:05.619]  They've now annexed about 10% of the eastern area of the nation.
[00:15:07.082 --> 00:15:13.765]  Zelensky that we know of has had over 80 billion dollars just since late February pumped into the country.
[00:15:13.805 --> 00:15:20.648]  Much of it is admitted to have been laundered back to the deep state in Europe and the United States.
[00:15:21.609 --> 00:15:24.570]  Zelensky's getting all these high-tech weapons, more and more heavy weapons.
[00:15:26.791 --> 00:15:28.872]  He's demanded aircraft, you name it.
[00:15:30.252 --> 00:15:35.855]  He's got missiles that can be fired and travel up to 100 miles into Russia.
[00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:43.158]  And now, Zelensky came out yesterday, the full speech is on Infowars.com.
[00:15:44.218 --> 00:15:49.060]  Breaking, Zelensky says NATO must, quote, launch preemptive strikes on Russia.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:59.243]  Preemptive strikes are needed so that they know what awaits them if they use nuclear weapons, Zelensky told the Lowy Institute on Thursday.
[00:16:00.184 --> 00:16:01.304]  Not the other way around.
[00:16:01.484 --> 00:16:05.846]  Waiting for Russian nuclear strikes and then saying, oh, you've done that.
[00:16:07.458 --> 00:16:08.179]  Then get this.
[00:16:08.199 --> 00:16:15.326]  It's honestly widely regarded as the next recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:16:16.927 --> 00:16:20.711]  And they gave it to Henry Kissinger and other warmongers and Obama, so why not?
[00:16:21.672 --> 00:16:22.473]  That's what you get now.
[00:16:22.513 --> 00:16:30.721]  They should posthumously give Hitler or Stalin or Genghis Khan the Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:16:32.093 --> 00:16:35.035]  They've made such a joke out of themselves.
[00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:41.518]  We'll play the clip of him saying this here in a moment, but do I need to tell listeners and viewers how dangerous this is?
[00:16:41.558 --> 00:16:42.759]  I don't think you need me to tell you, do you?
[00:16:43.159 --> 00:16:48.482]  But in case you're a leftist that just tuned in that loves war and pedophilia and open borders and fentanyl and collapse and death...
[00:16:50.188 --> 00:16:52.489]  Russia has one of the biggest nuclear arsenals in the world.
[00:16:52.669 --> 00:16:53.449]  They say the biggest.
[00:16:53.469 --> 00:16:53.849]  The U.S.
[00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:55.150]  actually has the biggest, I can tell you.
[00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:56.150]  Most of it's secret.
[00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:00.152]  But it doesn't matter if the West would destroy Russia.
[00:17:00.192 --> 00:17:01.032]  They will destroy us.
[00:17:01.792 --> 00:17:04.133]  It's called mutually assured destruction or MAD.
[00:17:05.593 --> 00:17:07.514]  Anyone that wants to violate that is MAD.
[00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:16.577]  And of course Biden came out and told a group of Democrat fundraisers at a fundraising event in New York yesterday that we're on the verge of Armageddon.
[00:17:17.458 --> 00:17:18.278]  Nuclear Armageddon.
[00:17:19.855 --> 00:17:27.157]  And the end of humanity as we know it, which is actually a true statement, rarely coming out of the geriatric puppet's mouth.
[00:17:28.458 --> 00:17:46.043]  So, now peace is preemptively, and he's implying nuclear weapons, attacking Russian bases inside Russia, which would make NATO and the West war criminals at a greater level than anyone in history.
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.580]  And they're just calmly talking about it.
[00:17:49.961 --> 00:17:55.182]  Now, at first when this came out yesterday, when I was still on air, the left was saying it's not real, it's a deep fake.
[00:17:55.222 --> 00:17:56.763]  No, Zelensky came out and said, no, it's real.
[00:17:57.863 --> 00:17:59.524]  And now they're defending it, saying, well, yeah.
[00:17:59.824 --> 00:18:09.207]  In fact, in the last few weeks, I've seen articles in the London Guardian, a bunch of other publications, saying nuclear war is on the table and we should just go ahead and hit Russia first.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:18.024]  And the Pentagon has a lot of war planners that say we should strike Russia first, which then again makes them have a hair trigger as well.
[00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:23.347]  So if you want to destroy human life and civilization, this is a really good way to get it going.
[00:18:23.367 --> 00:18:28.690]  There have been articles about how a nuclear war would reverse global warming and is good in the last week.
[00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.872]  So we're hearing all about this great thing called nuclear war.
[00:18:33.893 --> 00:18:36.114]  They were telling us a year ago, inflation is good for you too.
[00:18:36.294 --> 00:18:39.276]  Well, if you thought inflation was bad, well, try nuclear war.
[00:18:40.666 --> 00:18:40.986]  Breaking!
[00:18:41.006 --> 00:18:43.707]  Zelensky says NATO must launch pre-emptive strikes on Russia.
[00:18:44.347 --> 00:18:45.868]  Here is the dictator saying that.
[00:18:46.488 --> 00:18:50.129]  What should NATO do?
[00:18:50.169 --> 00:18:54.150]  To prevent Russia from using nuclear weapons.
[00:18:54.170 --> 00:19:08.493]   But what is important, I once again appeal to the international community, as it was before the 24th, preventive strikes so that they know what will happen to them if they use it,
[00:19:08.493 --> 00:19:09.352]  and not the other way around.
[00:19:09.352 --> 00:19:16.733]   Wait for nuclear strikes in Russia, and then say, "Oh, you're right, here, take it from us."
[00:19:16.733 --> 00:19:21.732]  Review the use of your pressure.
[00:19:21.732 --> 00:19:24.552]  Here, I think NATO should do it.
[00:19:24.552 --> 00:19:28.013]  Review the order of use.
[00:19:30.493 --> 00:19:41.533]   So, the famous gay porn star, now the president of Ukraine, he was elected, but now he's made
[00:19:41.533 --> 00:19:46.533]   himself a dictator on record, is saying, "The way we have peace is we attack Russia."
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.541]  He's clearly talking about nuclear weapons before they use them on us.
[00:19:51.401 --> 00:19:52.421]  Kind of a big deal, right?
[00:19:53.481 --> 00:19:54.602]  Kind of a big deal.
[00:19:55.202 --> 00:19:57.302]  That's what you call massive escalation.
[00:19:57.882 --> 00:20:02.143]  Here's a report on InfoWars.com, it's got the quotes, Biden warns of nuclear Armageddon.
[00:20:04.631 --> 00:20:04.872]  U.S.
[00:20:04.892 --> 00:20:12.276]  President Joe Biden has said the risk of nuclear war is at the highest level since the peak of the Cold War brinksmanship in the 1960s against the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:20:12.596 --> 00:20:16.738]  He further claimed that Russia could seek to deploy some of its huge arsenal in Ukraine.
[00:20:18.399 --> 00:20:32.908]  Speaking at a fundraiser of Democrat candidates in New York on Thursday, Biden invoked a biblical reference to warn of potential nuclear annihilation, stating that soaring hostilities between Russia and Ukraine are, with the West, could escalate to outright, quote, Armageddon.
[00:20:33.522 --> 00:20:39.682]   Here's the quote, "For the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis, we have a direct
[00:20:39.682 --> 00:20:43.762]  threat of the use of nuclear weapon.
[00:20:43.762 --> 00:20:46.302]  If in fact things continue down the path they are going,"
[00:20:46.302 --> 00:20:51.322]   the president said, apparently referring to the war still raging in Eastern Europe.
[00:20:51.322 --> 00:20:55.122]  We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since U.S.
[00:20:55.147 --> 00:20:56.528]  President John F. Kennedy.
[00:20:57.008 --> 00:21:08.595]  Biden went on to assert that the Russian military is significantly underperforming Ukraine, saying that could raise the stakes in the conflict, ultimately leading to dangerous spike in violence should Moscow become desperate, which Moscow is becoming desperate.
[00:21:10.376 --> 00:21:15.560]  So a bunch of quotes, uh, brigadier generals and others, uh, talking about imminent nuclear war.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.660]  It goes on from there.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.501]  Here, let's just read these.
[00:21:17.941 --> 00:21:32.207]   Despite the President's dire warnings, however, White House Press Secretary Said earlier this week that officials had not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture as there is no indication that Russia is preparing to immediately use nuclear weapons.
[00:21:33.688 --> 00:21:37.672]  But other Pentagon officials said that nuclear war may be needed.
[00:21:38.052 --> 00:21:40.134]  And I played some of those clips yesterday.
[00:21:40.955 --> 00:21:43.257]  So that's where we are right now.
[00:21:44.538 --> 00:21:51.257]   Then there's lots of fake incendiary news, where the Russians will bury dead Ukrainian soldiers
[00:21:51.257 --> 00:21:56.876]   with crosses, with their information, and then they come dig 'em up, call 'em a mass grave.
[00:21:56.876 --> 00:21:58.297]  Well, they've done it again.
[00:21:58.297 --> 00:22:03.498]   Gold teeth, Ukraine recovered from Russian, mini Auschwitz torture chamber,
[00:22:03.498 --> 00:22:07.778]   were actually from a village dentist who was shaving 'em up to melt them down,
[00:22:07.778 --> 00:22:09.678]  which my dad was a dentist.
[00:22:09.678 --> 00:22:24.054]   Sometimes his patients didn't want the tooth He would pile them up, pull it off with pliers, and then he melted and made my mom some beautiful necklaces, bracelets, and rings that she still has today out of people's teeth.
[00:22:24.974 --> 00:22:27.556]  My dad would sit there at a workbench he had at night.
[00:22:27.576 --> 00:22:29.518]  Probably couldn't do it when I was about 10.
[00:22:29.558 --> 00:22:30.959]  It was probably the last time he made jewelry.
[00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:32.440]  He made his brother a ring too.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.202]  It says JoLynn Jones on it.
[00:22:35.283 --> 00:22:38.045]  And he made himself a ring, said David R. Jones.
[00:22:38.806 --> 00:22:45.411]  But he would sit there and smelt it, heat it up, purify it, and then make a cast, and then pour it, and he made some really nice jewelry.
[00:22:45.872 --> 00:22:47.033]  And that's what this guy was doing.
[00:22:47.133 --> 00:22:53.458]  That now turns into... They have death camps, like the Nazis, pulling people's teeth out.
[00:22:54.959 --> 00:23:00.323]  Meanwhile, Zelensky signs law that rules out Ukraine peace talks with Putin as impossible.
[00:23:01.344 --> 00:23:02.065]  What a nice guy.
[00:23:03.297 --> 00:23:12.041]  All right, we're going to move on to the massive COVID-19 death shot news that's just even tops yesterday's news.
[00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:18.043]  And then we're going to look at the sterilization of our children invasion taking place and so much more.
[00:23:19.404 --> 00:23:25.847]  I'm going to hit the incredible poison vaccine developments in the last segment of this hour coming up.
[00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:35.972]  I want to get back into the nuclear war threat and how it ties down to the shutdown of the economy, replacement migration, and what the Cato Institute is up to, saying we need to shut off jobs to punish white people in America.
[00:23:36.012 --> 00:23:36.612]  I'm not kidding.
[00:23:37.252 --> 00:23:38.453]  This is the new world order running this.
[00:23:38.473 --> 00:23:43.714]  These people are Nazis 2.0, very sophisticated, posing as leftists.
[00:23:44.714 --> 00:23:45.934]  But we're going to be getting to that in a moment.
[00:23:45.954 --> 00:23:53.316]  But here is a little piece we put together three months ago, warning of how the situation in Ukraine would escalate into the potential for nuclear war.
[00:23:55.455 --> 00:23:55.755]  U.S.
[00:23:55.795 --> 00:24:02.964]  Senators in both parties saying we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first, and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before.
[00:24:03.204 --> 00:24:05.487]  What do you think that makes the Russians do?
[00:24:05.747 --> 00:24:07.189]  Well, it makes them go into war mode.
[00:24:10.134 --> 00:24:11.635]  So I don't like them invading Ukraine.
[00:24:11.695 --> 00:24:15.076]  I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert.
[00:24:15.476 --> 00:24:19.737]  Only one level above that on their DEFCON, just like our system, and that's fire the weapons.
[00:24:20.717 --> 00:24:27.379]  And so now we have Democrats all over the news saying, let's just use nuclear weapons on Russia.
[00:24:27.779 --> 00:24:29.080]  Think of their ignorance.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:39.066]  Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast with sea-launched missiles that would vaporize our cities within five minutes on average of being launched.
[00:24:39.607 --> 00:24:43.169]  Sea-launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach 5.
[00:24:43.529 --> 00:24:49.153]  Land-launched systems they can also launch from ships that are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down.
[00:24:49.694 --> 00:24:51.355]  And yes, the United States has those too.
[00:24:52.711 --> 00:24:55.853]  That's a Pentagon lie that Russia developed systems that we don't have.
[00:24:55.873 --> 00:24:57.354]  It's on record the U.S.
[00:24:57.414 --> 00:24:58.595]  has those systems.
[00:24:58.635 --> 00:25:03.678]  The point is it's called mutually assured destruction or MAD for a reason.
[00:25:04.498 --> 00:25:07.780]  Because anyone that would violate the MAD doctrine is insane.
[00:25:08.821 --> 00:25:10.962]  And you know, I'm on the side of not having a nuclear war.
[00:25:11.743 --> 00:25:13.464]  Especially when Russia's not starting a fight with us.
[00:25:13.744 --> 00:25:19.748]  And especially after we just heard for years that everything happening in this country is run by Russia when that was all a giant lie.
[00:25:19.748 --> 00:25:26.748]  the globalist of the outside evil force.
[00:25:26.748 --> 00:25:31.228]   For a year and a half I've been starting the show with air raid sirens.
[00:25:31.228 --> 00:25:32.067]  Peace.
[00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:37.434]  Previously, I only play air raid sirens two or three times a year to really note that we were in danger.
[00:25:37.794 --> 00:25:38.575]  Now it's every day.
[00:25:39.916 --> 00:25:41.157]  Because that's the sound you hear.
[00:25:41.177 --> 00:25:46.221]  Air raid sirens are still up in Austin, Dallas, Texas, and towns wherever you live.
[00:25:47.041 --> 00:25:49.041]   When the nukes are coming in, that's what you're going to hear.
[00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:57.682]  So what am I supposed to say?
[00:25:57.835 --> 00:25:58.595]  What are we supposed to do?
[00:25:58.655 --> 00:26:00.596]  We have a president that can't even talk.
[00:26:01.276 --> 00:26:03.397]  We've got a vice president that doesn't know what planet she's on.
[00:26:04.257 --> 00:26:06.597]  We've got mainstream news promoting pedophilia everywhere.
[00:26:08.118 --> 00:26:09.878]  We've got record suicide and crime.
[00:26:09.998 --> 00:26:11.999]  I mean, we are cursed.
[00:26:12.319 --> 00:26:13.379]  And we need to get back to God.
[00:26:14.759 --> 00:26:16.660]  So next segment I'll hit all the poison vaccine news.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.980]  I want to finish up with this now.
[00:26:19.241 --> 00:26:22.441]  Because it's not just Zelensky calling for preemptive nuclear war against Russia.
[00:26:22.501 --> 00:26:24.902]  It's not just Biden saying we're on the verge of Armageddon.
[00:26:26.886 --> 00:26:27.746]  It's not just U.S.
[00:26:27.786 --> 00:26:30.547]  piles up on anti-radiation drugs but doesn't warn the people.
[00:26:31.987 --> 00:26:32.747]  $290 million worth.
[00:26:35.148 --> 00:26:35.968]  No, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:39.369 --> 00:26:41.969]  It's economic warfare against our country.
[00:26:43.229 --> 00:26:53.991]  And never has it been more obvious that the globalists are in direct war with the working class and the middle class of this country, which they branded as being anti-white.
[00:26:54.332 --> 00:26:56.552]  Oh, let's make poor people poor because they're white.
[00:26:58.018 --> 00:27:00.259]  When you make the general public poor, you make everybody poor.
[00:27:00.959 --> 00:27:13.842]  And if you look at the charts, if you cut out the top white billionaires at the top, in the nouveau riche and the wealthy and the middle class and the poor, Asians, Asian groups, fill the top nine slots.
[00:27:15.102 --> 00:27:16.442]  The number 10 is whites.
[00:27:17.883 --> 00:27:19.223]  Number 11 is Hispanics.
[00:27:21.203 --> 00:27:23.804]  Number 12 is blacks.
[00:27:26.212 --> 00:27:34.857]  And then number 13 or 14, you can pull the graphs up, of the poorest people in America are people living on Native American reservations.
[00:27:35.457 --> 00:27:44.402]  The top nine groups of the most wealthy people in America per capita is Asians.
[00:27:45.222 --> 00:27:47.403]  And everybody thinks and goes, oh, I knew that.
[00:27:48.284 --> 00:27:49.524]  I mean, the stereotype's true.
[00:27:49.605 --> 00:27:54.346]   On average, Asians, lowest crime rate, Work 15, 18 hours a day.
[00:27:54.686 --> 00:27:56.647]  Almost all the valedictorians are Asian.
[00:27:56.967 --> 00:27:57.707]  Let's not lie.
[00:27:59.088 --> 00:28:04.770]  Asians keep to themselves on average and work their asses off.
[00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:20.036]  But then to turn around and say that let's have a bad economy to hurt white people, and I'm going to play a clip in a moment saying that, not from Black Lives Matter, not from some leftist group funded by Soros, but from the Cato Institute and an old white man.
[00:28:22.774 --> 00:28:25.777]  Saying we need to make white people poor.
[00:28:26.978 --> 00:28:28.039]  That takes their power.
[00:28:28.079 --> 00:28:29.180]  What the hell does that mean?
[00:28:29.421 --> 00:28:33.805]  A bunch of ultra-rich old white men and old Asian men and old Arab men.
[00:28:34.706 --> 00:28:36.828]  And a few Latin Americans and a few Asians.
[00:28:38.502 --> 00:28:54.591]  You go to a Bilderberg group meeting, you go cover a globalist meeting, it's a bunch of old royalty and a bunch of old rich white people including rich Jews and some Asians and some Middle Eastern royalty and a few people from Latin America.
[00:28:58.533 --> 00:29:17.943]   And so the media tries to make it a racial issue when it's a bunch of old white people A lot of them got their wealth from Nazis, like Klaus Schwab and a bunch of eugenicists like Bill Gates, with a bunch of ADL folks running around promoting racial division.
[00:29:18.443 --> 00:29:24.488]  The closest thing I see to Hitler, people setting up a race-based society, is the left and the big banks funding them.
[00:29:24.508 --> 00:29:28.871]  So I'm going to hit the oil news that's so incredible, and the energy news.
[00:29:29.232 --> 00:29:37.018]  But first, the stories on Infowars.com, Economist Blast, rural white males of low education.
[00:29:38.755 --> 00:29:41.476]  While downplaying made-in-USA manufacturing.
[00:29:41.876 --> 00:29:49.720]  So he says, I'll play the clip, these old white people, these white males that want power, they don't want their jobs shipped to China.
[00:29:51.581 --> 00:29:55.622]  Who do you think works in factories in rural areas and farms and ranches?
[00:29:57.663 --> 00:29:59.404]  Hispanics, black people, and white people.
[00:30:00.458 --> 00:30:04.261]  I've got family in the farming, and in the timber, and in the ranching industry.
[00:30:04.981 --> 00:30:18.872]  And I can tell you, you go look when people are working out there, it's a group of diverse, hard-working, good people that go to lunch together, and go to church together, and that have assimilated very well in our community.
[00:30:20.313 --> 00:30:22.655]  And it's the same all across this damn country.
[00:30:24.349 --> 00:30:31.611]  And that's what they want to target is that and say, oh, let's take power from the white people by taking your jobs away.
[00:30:32.051 --> 00:30:38.832]  Anybody with half a brain knows they want to bankrupt everybody to make us on the universal basic income and the social credit score to control our lives.
[00:30:40.233 --> 00:30:42.013]  So here's the article on InfoWars.com.
[00:30:42.373 --> 00:30:49.275]  Economists blast rural white males of low education while downplaying made-in-the-USA manufacturing.
[00:30:51.135 --> 00:30:52.836]  An astounding clip from the Cato Institute.
[00:30:53.692 --> 00:31:11.933]   One of the influential Adam Pozen economists, head of the Peterson Institute, says, a focus on domestic manufacturing is simply a fetish for keeping white males And low education in the power positions they're in.
[00:31:11.953 --> 00:31:18.115]  Because the truth is, a lot of people, doesn't matter what color you are, decide to not go get a college education because most of them are worthless.
[00:31:18.415 --> 00:31:24.896]  You decide to go into industry and into work and you work 10-20 years and learn the industry and you start your own company and you become successful.
[00:31:27.297 --> 00:31:32.178]  In auto parts and manufacturing and farming and ranching and meatpacking or whatever the case is.
[00:31:32.498 --> 00:31:39.787]   And they're saying, oh we don't want any of that down here because People that don't know the education system, they might be successful and they might have a job.
[00:31:40.108 --> 00:31:41.488]  Listen to this monster.
[00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:49.673]  I'm sure I'm going to piss off both left and right, so I apologize.
[00:31:49.833 --> 00:32:01.280]  The fetish for manufacturing is part of the general fetish for keeping white males of low education outside the cities in the powerful positions they're in in the U.S.
[00:32:04.775 --> 00:32:06.736]  That is really what's going on here.
[00:32:07.236 --> 00:32:10.917]  Because when you look at the costs of manufacturing... You know, hit pause.
[00:32:11.977 --> 00:32:13.197]  We're going to come back and play all this.
[00:32:14.317 --> 00:32:16.918]  But just imagine the fetish for manufacturing.
[00:32:16.938 --> 00:32:18.599]  This guy's never had a real job.
[00:32:18.639 --> 00:32:19.879]  He's a parasite.
[00:32:20.379 --> 00:32:21.599]  He weighs like 400 pounds.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:27.461]  And he's sitting up here with this panel that's shutting down America and taking us over with Bill Gates.
[00:32:28.703 --> 00:32:34.933]  And he says it's these white males who have a fetish for having a job or a fetish for owning their own company.
[00:32:35.434 --> 00:32:39.180]  Now it's racial, you see, if you want to have a job or you want to have your own company.
[00:32:40.121 --> 00:32:41.363]  These people are disgusting.
[00:32:41.583 --> 00:32:42.465]  Everything they do.
[00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.311]  Is to rob us and de-industrialize us and control us.
[00:32:46.331 --> 00:32:47.852]  Yeah, we got a fetish to own our own house.
[00:32:48.172 --> 00:32:49.592]  We got a fetish to lead our own lives.
[00:32:49.893 --> 00:32:51.913]  We got a fetish to own guns and protect ourselves.
[00:32:52.214 --> 00:32:54.254]  And everybody should have that fetish, and they are.
[00:32:54.574 --> 00:33:02.698]  And if the average person who isn't white picks up the American culture, it's game over for big, fat, degenerate, scumbag criminals like you, you disgusting blob!
[00:33:03.578 --> 00:33:19.548]   So scumbags like Adam Posson at the Cato Institute, a big, lazy, stupid Brian Stelter pimp of the globalists, Is up there saying, oh people fetishize having their own industries and their own jobs and being local businesses.
[00:33:19.568 --> 00:33:21.350]  That's why they have the lockdowns is to shut those down.
[00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:24.473]  And he says it's a bunch of uneducated white people.
[00:33:24.813 --> 00:33:26.154]  You mean people that actually have jobs?
[00:33:26.875 --> 00:33:28.096]  You elitist dirtbag?
[00:33:28.577 --> 00:33:34.242]  And all the tens of millions of people that have worthless college degrees that can't get a damn job in your parasitic system?
[00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:45.315]  And these are the leftists and these are the corporate globalists that have produced hundreds of movies and TV shows trying to create a race war so we don't have 10 to 1 black on white crime.
[00:33:45.535 --> 00:33:58.565]   We have 21 to 1 black on white crime because they've got a large minority of black people, not Not the majority of black people who are great folks, but a large minority to go out and attack white people, including white babies and children.
[00:33:58.585 --> 00:34:00.087]  I have stacks of news today about it.
[00:34:00.467 --> 00:34:12.459]  Running over people with cars, crazy black people running into hospitals, strangling white babies to death, because people climbing in folks' windows at night, killing white babies because they're white.
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:14.521]  You see it everywhere.
[00:34:16.329 --> 00:34:16.809]  21 to 1.
[00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:32.095]  For every crime committed against a black person by a white person, there's 21 violent crimes committed because these monsters in academia and the corporate system are telling black people, mainly young, uneducated, brainwashed black men that whites are the devil.
[00:34:32.315 --> 00:34:32.836]  Well, you know what?
[00:34:32.896 --> 00:34:33.816]  Whites are the devil.
[00:34:34.596 --> 00:34:36.837]  This guy at the Cato Institute's the damn devil.
[00:34:37.117 --> 00:34:38.198]  And he's our enemy!
[00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:44.000]  Planned Parenthood's admitted target is black people to kill you.
[00:34:44.645 --> 00:34:46.706]  But if they can't kill you, they'll use you as a weapon.
[00:34:50.088 --> 00:34:52.049]  Unbelievable monster.
[00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:57.491]  So here he is saying, uneducated white people want to have jobs.
[00:34:57.912 --> 00:35:01.754]  They don't want their jobs shipped to China for slave camps and suicide nets.
[00:35:01.794 --> 00:35:02.234]  Here he is.
[00:35:04.201 --> 00:35:08.547]  I'm sure I'm going to piss off both left and right, so I apologize.
[00:35:09.588 --> 00:35:18.220]  That the fetish for manufacturing is part of the general fetish for keeping white males of low education... Start it over again.
[00:35:19.261 --> 00:35:24.904]  He's sitting there with electricity, putting the lights on, all these cameras, all these microphones, all this manufacturing.
[00:35:25.465 --> 00:35:28.566]  The tablecloth, the bottled water, the coffee he's drinking.
[00:35:29.167 --> 00:35:32.068]  That's people working, but they're building a post-human world.
[00:35:32.128 --> 00:35:34.230]  So now, having a job's racist.
[00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:39.032]  And as they get rid of the jobs, they say, we can't let white people have jobs.
[00:35:39.272 --> 00:35:41.754]  We gotta take their jobs to make us fight with each other.
[00:35:41.914 --> 00:35:43.034]  These guys are villains!
[00:35:44.375 --> 00:35:45.496]  Start over with this maggot.
[00:35:47.836 --> 00:35:52.138]  I'm sure I'm going to piss off both left and right, so I apologize.
[00:35:53.219 --> 00:35:57.141]  That the fetish for manufacturing is part of the... Back at him again.
[00:35:58.401 --> 00:36:02.203]  That's his little joke to the so-called elitists how they're going to make us all fight and kill each other.
[00:36:02.463 --> 00:36:03.704]  I'm going to piss off both sides.
[00:36:04.524 --> 00:36:05.145]  They're all giggling.
[00:36:05.485 --> 00:36:06.425]  Ah, we're in control.
[00:36:06.645 --> 00:36:08.046]  We're manipulating them against each other.
[00:36:08.086 --> 00:36:08.887]  It's so funny.
[00:36:10.014 --> 00:36:15.800]  Just like Hitler used race-based stuff to control people, while he claims he's trying to stop racial division, that's what he's doing!
[00:36:16.481 --> 00:36:20.565]  While he brings us all to our knees, he is our collective enemy!
[00:36:21.145 --> 00:36:22.467]  He's the enemy of the people!
[00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:26.171]  I'm gonna stop interrupting.
[00:36:26.191 --> 00:36:27.732]  Just put that blob back on screen.
[00:36:27.752 --> 00:36:31.256]  He's hard to- just the sickening voice of a devil.
[00:36:31.636 --> 00:36:32.277]  Put him back up there.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.885]  I'm sure I'm going to piss off both left and right, so I apologize.
[00:36:39.946 --> 00:36:46.093]  That the fetish for manufacturing is part of the general fetish for keeping white males of low education.
[00:36:46.133 --> 00:36:46.873]  You know, hit pause again.
[00:36:46.894 --> 00:36:47.654]  Back it up to the start again.
[00:36:47.674 --> 00:36:48.455]  I'm going to stop now.
[00:36:50.177 --> 00:36:56.324]  They have a fetish to have tariffs here and internal regulations so that we can't have manufacturing in America or export.
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:06.948]  While they shut off our pipelines and control our whole life, and admit they're doing it on purpose as he's doing here, but they have a fetish for slave labor in China, where the people get none of the fruits of their labor.
[00:37:06.968 --> 00:37:10.391]  These are the middlemen criminals that Trump talked about.
[00:37:10.771 --> 00:37:16.896]  Alright, I'm not going to interrupt again, but just everything he says is a declaration of war against everybody.
[00:37:16.936 --> 00:37:17.237]  Here it is.
[00:37:19.218 --> 00:37:24.903]  I'm sure I'm going to piss off both left and right, so I apologize.
[00:37:25.083 --> 00:37:36.533]  The fetish for manufacturing is part of the general fetish for keeping white males of low education outside the cities in the powerful positions they're in in the U.S.
[00:37:40.014 --> 00:37:41.976]  That is really what's going on here.
[00:37:42.496 --> 00:37:58.349]  Because when you look at the costs of manufacturing, and Susan Hausman and her co-authors have done a lot of manufacturing of trade, and job displacement, and community, Susan Hausman and her co-authors have done a lot of work on this, and I'm sure she'll have a different view than I do.
[00:37:59.029 --> 00:38:06.496]  But when I look at the so-called costs of the China shock, or the costs of the decline in manufacturing, I always think compared to what?
[00:38:08.064 --> 00:38:13.405]  For decades, there was enormous displacement of African Americans in this economy.
[00:38:13.485 --> 00:38:20.747]  Every time there was a recession, African American unemployment rates shot up much faster and higher than white unemployment rates.
[00:38:21.488 --> 00:38:33.411]  Single women were methodically excluded from the workforce, especially if they became parents, or ghettoed in particular sets of jobs throughout the economy, well through the 70s and to the 80s.
[00:38:35.295 --> 00:38:46.380]  Displacements on large scales would happen when technology or trade broke through, like all the secretaries who got replaced by personal computers and other forms of office animation.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.481]  Excuse me, not animation, automation, excuse me.
[00:38:51.422 --> 00:38:55.724]  And these kinds of churn, as economists put it, never were decried.
[00:38:56.877 --> 00:38:58.558]  They never got political attention.
[00:38:59.198 --> 00:39:00.699]  They never got much notice.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:11.605]  But when it started being the white male manufacturing people in the so-called heartland, which by definition was not urban, then suddenly this was a crisis.
[00:39:14.287 --> 00:39:18.889]  The de-industrialization of America has hurt blacks, Hispanics, and women worse than anybody.
[00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:23.632]  But again, they have sold the country out by design with one-sided trade deals.
[00:39:24.451 --> 00:39:25.531]  They get fabulously rich.
[00:39:25.551 --> 00:39:27.852]  During the lockdowns, the average billionaire doubles their profit.
[00:39:29.113 --> 00:39:33.555]  And then they have the nerve to turn around and make it racial that they're shutting the country down.
[00:39:34.195 --> 00:39:36.896]  And we're gonna get the white people by doing this.
[00:39:36.996 --> 00:39:39.277]  It's absolute fraud.
[00:39:39.337 --> 00:39:42.518]  Just look at that Brian Stelter-like creature.
[00:39:44.219 --> 00:39:45.860]  And how stupid he thinks you are.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.801]  Let's talk about facts, you demonic toad.
[00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:58.111]  Biden administration weighs complete block on all new drilling, including offshore in the United States.
[00:39:58.331 --> 00:40:01.532]  All drilling for gas and oil as prices explode.
[00:40:01.632 --> 00:40:02.293]  Fox Business.
[00:40:03.233 --> 00:40:08.155]  As Biden welcomes Venezuelan oil, a communist dictatorship, he prepares to block all U.S.
[00:40:08.315 --> 00:40:09.055]  offshore drilling.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.881]  Polish households burn trash to stay warm as sanctions on Russia backfire.
[00:40:15.442 --> 00:40:20.103]  Energy crisis, people in Poland burn trash to keep warm in the coal shortage.
[00:40:20.824 --> 00:40:24.285]  Daily blackouts hit the UK this winter, up to three days a week.
[00:40:25.045 --> 00:40:30.487]  Multiple times a day warns National Grid, training you to be a slave and not have any power.
[00:40:30.607 --> 00:40:36.469]  Meanwhile, flooded electric cars spontaneously catch on fire in Florida after hurricane.
[00:40:39.185 --> 00:40:45.551]  So is cutting off the Keystone Pipeline, did that sock it to the Midwestern white guys?
[00:40:46.892 --> 00:40:50.335]  Did only buying communist oil out of Venezuela sock it to the white guys?
[00:40:51.156 --> 00:40:52.537]  No, it's to shut the country down.
[00:40:52.817 --> 00:40:58.102]  Go out to an oil field or go out to a pipeline and go take a look at what color the people are.
[00:40:59.042 --> 00:41:01.525]  They're every damn color and they got good paying jobs.
[00:41:02.694 --> 00:41:04.875]  These people want to bring you to your knees.
[00:41:05.135 --> 00:41:09.398]  And if you're too stupid to know that they're your enemy, then we deserve what we get.
[00:41:09.538 --> 00:41:10.418]  But you're not stupid.
[00:41:10.638 --> 00:41:12.079]  You see through these damn monsters.
[00:41:12.499 --> 00:41:19.823]  What does you paying $4 a gallon for gas do if you're black or white or old or young or gay or straight?
[00:41:20.043 --> 00:41:23.325]  They're attacking every damn one of us and they know it!
[00:41:26.107 --> 00:41:31.770]  And they think it's funny when that fat son of a bitch can't even wipe his ass.
[00:41:32.759 --> 00:41:37.403]  But he rules over us in those damn universities as they destroy the country.
[00:41:37.443 --> 00:41:37.904]  Excuse me.
[00:41:40.025 --> 00:41:41.146]  Mark Passio is joining us.

[00:43:10.784 --> 00:43:15.065]  I want to thank all the folks who are helping us with my personal legal defense fund.
[00:43:15.425 --> 00:43:20.385]   I gotta pay 40% of legal bills around here and we got a plan to appeal these giant fake judgments,
[00:43:20.385 --> 00:43:21.224]  these rigged courts.
[00:43:21.224 --> 00:43:23.905]   We can stay on the air for years, the appeals, but we need money to do 'em.
[00:43:23.905 --> 00:43:30.545]   So please go to saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com, make a donation to my individual legal defense fund,

[00:43:33.705 --> 00:43:36.443]  (dramatic music)
[00:43:36.443 --> 00:43:41.964]  Why don't we talk about cryptocurrency?
[00:43:43.585 --> 00:43:51.824]   Because one of the ways that you encourage your audience to give you money is in cryptocurrency donations, right?
[00:43:51.834 --> 00:43:52.114]  Yes.
[00:43:52.735 --> 00:43:56.157]  And you have a page on your website that's just for cryptocurrency donations, right?
[00:43:56.518 --> 00:43:58.359]  InfoWars.com forward slash crypto.
[00:43:58.439 --> 00:44:01.081]  Is that a little advertisement just there?
[00:44:01.242 --> 00:44:02.282]  Well, we're fighting the deep state.
[00:44:02.302 --> 00:44:02.803]  We need money.
[00:44:03.023 --> 00:44:03.243]  All right.
[00:44:04.184 --> 00:44:04.845]  This is it.
[00:44:05.485 --> 00:44:06.386]  Give crypto.
[00:44:06.486 --> 00:44:07.607]  Fund InfoWars.
[00:44:08.419 --> 00:44:11.581]  Sponsor us with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, right?
[00:44:12.121 --> 00:44:14.083]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight.
[00:44:14.683 --> 00:44:16.704]  Your advertisement for a cryptocurrency page.
[00:44:18.045 --> 00:44:26.751]  You know, I mean, people want to keep us in the fight, so I hope whoever the big whales are will give us money before we keep going.
[00:44:26.791 --> 00:44:31.153]  We'll just keep minting money as you're in this courtroom.
[00:44:31.714 --> 00:44:33.695]  Let's move on.
[00:44:33.535 --> 00:44:34.895]  People care about the First Amendment.
[00:44:34.895 --> 00:44:41.894]  I won't get to get what I'm after.
[00:44:42.773 --> 00:44:47.561]  Well, that's because you're not listening to Mark Passio and Alex Jones and David Nye and others, because we know what's going on.
[00:44:47.581 --> 00:44:48.562]  We're not bragging.
[00:44:48.602 --> 00:44:49.123]  It's just a fact.
[00:44:49.143 --> 00:44:49.864]  That's why they hate us.
[00:44:52.057 --> 00:44:52.977]  He joins us for the rest of the hour.
[00:44:52.997 --> 00:44:54.198]  I've been meaning to get him back on.
[00:44:54.218 --> 00:44:59.099]  I listen to him all the time, and he's always been big, but man, people talk about Mark Paschio all over the place.
[00:44:59.699 --> 00:45:02.320]  I want to do some big commercial-free podcasts with him soon.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.420]  My wife's a big fan as well.
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:08.621]  Mark Paschio is an independent researcher and public speaker from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
[00:45:08.661 --> 00:45:18.403]  For years, Mark's work has been teaching universal spiritual laws and morality upon which all human freedom depends, and he woke up inside the system, inside the occult, and woke up to that.
[00:45:18.803 --> 00:45:20.444]  WhatOnEarthIsHappening.com.
[00:45:21.224 --> 00:45:27.485]  Some stations don't carry this first five, but Mark, I'm going to try to give you the floor because I'll jump in and take over, you know, if you pause.
[00:45:27.505 --> 00:45:35.367]  I want to be able to talk about the state of the world, why you think it's happening, PsyOps, one of your latest shows I saw was really good, pretty quick, short show, but still powerful.
[00:45:36.147 --> 00:45:42.769]  I really want you to just turn it loose here today, but spend three, four minutes on who you are and your awakening and how you see the universe.
[00:45:43.763 --> 00:45:44.023]  Sure.
[00:45:44.083 --> 00:45:44.924]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:45:45.004 --> 00:45:46.885]  I'm really honored to be back on InfoWars.
[00:45:46.905 --> 00:45:48.346]  Thank you for inviting me back on.
[00:45:49.267 --> 00:45:57.573]  As you said in the bio intro, I'm an independent researcher from Philadelphia, but my background comes from occultism.
[00:45:57.953 --> 00:46:03.257]  And when I was young, I became very disillusioned with traditional religion.
[00:46:04.077 --> 00:46:12.042]  As it didn't answer the questions to the problems that I wanted answers to, at least in my estimation.
[00:46:12.722 --> 00:46:18.445]  And when I became very disillusioned with that, I sought out its inversion and opposite.
[00:46:18.606 --> 00:46:23.308]  I wanted to go to the exact opposite of what I considered religion to be at the time.
[00:46:24.149 --> 00:46:29.712]  And I found it in the form of dark occultism, specifically Satanism.
[00:46:30.527 --> 00:46:46.735]  And I devoured all of the writings of Anton LaVey, the former high priest of the Church of Satan, and I began espousing the satanic ideology in my writings and in my music, which became published through different mediums.
[00:46:46.936 --> 00:47:07.364]   And when that happened, when I was, you know, writing about the satanic ideology and I was expressing it through lyrics and songs that I wrote in my youth, Membership within the Church of Satan actually reviewed that work and brought it to the attention of LaVey himself.
[00:47:08.184 --> 00:47:15.090]  And LeVay wanted to commission me as a priest in the Church of Satan, and he sent me that appointment.
[00:47:15.651 --> 00:47:18.613]  So I was actually appointed to the Church of Satan.
[00:47:18.633 --> 00:47:24.458]  I had been a ranking member, a regular rank-and-file member, I should say, at the time.
[00:47:25.179 --> 00:47:31.224]  And LeVay himself saw my communication capability through my writings and music.
[00:47:31.864 --> 00:47:35.125]  And he appointed me to the priesthood within that organization.
[00:47:35.145 --> 00:47:39.587]  There's actually five ranks within that level of Satanism.
[00:47:39.647 --> 00:47:55.414]  And again, this form of Satanism through the Church of Satan only filters into the wider satanic network that is worldwide, that's really the people who are controlling our current world paradigm and our reality on this planet right now.
[00:47:56.184 --> 00:48:15.911]  And there is High Priest, underneath him there's Council of Nine, underneath the Council that acts like a ruling body is Magisters and Magistras, which are intermediary priests between the High Priest and the regular priest class.
[00:48:16.351 --> 00:48:18.952]  Then there's regular priest class, and then there's member.
[00:48:19.072 --> 00:48:20.493]  Those are the only five ranks.
[00:48:21.013 --> 00:48:24.154]  I attain to the second rank from the bottom.
[00:48:24.514 --> 00:48:28.266]  After member you can go up to priest and that's all I ever did.
[00:48:28.447 --> 00:48:30.554]  So you were literally commissioned by the Church of Satan?
[00:48:31.454 --> 00:48:32.034]  That's correct.
[00:48:32.254 --> 00:48:41.220]  So I was appointed the rank of priest by the current high priest at the time, Anton LaVey, who obviously has since passed.
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:41.700]  He died in 1997.
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:55.548]  And I was then offered, after appointment to priesthood, to run what they call a grotto, which is their equivalent of a coven in traditional witchcraft systems.
[00:48:56.068 --> 00:49:02.273]   They call their organizations within this particular group Stay right there.
[00:49:02.313 --> 00:49:04.415]  This is fascinating to understand how you awakened.
[00:49:04.776 --> 00:49:09.621]  Finish up this incredible information with Mark Passio on the other side and we'll talk about what's coming next.
[00:49:09.641 --> 00:49:10.022]  Stay with us.
[00:49:11.103 --> 00:49:14.066]  Alright, I've known about Mark Passio for at least eight years or so.
[00:49:15.419 --> 00:49:20.861]  And he really wakes a lot of people up and there's a big buzz on the street the last couple years.
[00:49:20.921 --> 00:49:21.901]  It's really intensified.
[00:49:21.921 --> 00:49:26.043]  I mean, I'm almost every time I go out in public, people walk over and say, Hey, I like Mark Passio.
[00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:26.683]  I like your show.
[00:49:27.043 --> 00:49:27.743]  You should get him on.
[00:49:27.783 --> 00:49:28.564]  I'm like, absolutely.
[00:49:28.584 --> 00:49:35.646]  I want to get him on a regular basis because he really exposes the hierarchy of the new world order, how it is satanic, how it basically operates.
[00:49:35.686 --> 00:49:40.966]   And if he just joined us, he was a commissioned priest in the church of Satan, OK?
[00:49:40.966 --> 00:49:46.125]   And he'd gotten to that point when we went to break describing then his awakening
[00:49:46.125 --> 00:49:47.204]  and what developed.
[00:49:47.204 --> 00:49:50.006]   Because he was rebelling against, obviously, the corrupt system he saw.
[00:49:50.006 --> 00:49:51.666]  He thought, I'll go the other direction.
[00:49:51.666 --> 00:49:54.565]  And then he found a lot deeper knowledge there.
[00:49:54.565 --> 00:49:58.126]  It's a very popular show, whatonearthshappening.com.
[00:49:58.126 --> 00:49:59.365]  And Mark Passio joins us now.
[00:49:59.365 --> 00:50:01.565]  So Mark, finish up about yourself and your awakening.
[00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:07.646]   Let's dive into current events, natural law, why the world's going crazy, and why
[00:50:07.646 --> 00:50:12.286]  you think your message right now is really punching through.
[00:50:11.024 --> 00:50:13.385]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:50:13.425 --> 00:50:21.468]  So yes, before the break I was talking about my appointment by the then current high priest of the Church of Satan, Anton LaVey, to the rank of priest.
[00:50:22.628 --> 00:50:31.631]  LaVey then wanted me to head a grotto, which is their equivalent of a coven in witchcraft in the Philadelphia area where I live.
[00:50:32.311 --> 00:50:44.595]  I declined to do that because I saw Satanism and the Satanic ideology at the time as a very personal influence in one's life and I did not want to be involved in group dynamics at the time.
[00:50:45.195 --> 00:50:58.619]  I did, however, ask to be sent information about active Grottos in my area that I wished to check out and to become perhaps involved with them at a rudimentary level.
[00:50:59.539 --> 00:51:02.622]  I was subsequently sent that information via mail.
[00:51:03.743 --> 00:51:09.828]  You know, the Internet was kind of around at this time, but you know, a lot of people still did things by, you know, regular mail.
[00:51:09.988 --> 00:51:16.013]  So I was sent some contact information, and I started attending some Grottos in my area.
[00:51:16.733 --> 00:51:45.880]   Upon attending Grottos in my tri-state area around Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, I became aware that these were not isolated people working together in just small groups to increase their own knowledge of the occult and what it is, how it's actually very advanced hidden psychology that could actually give one sort of a leg up on their fellow men in the world, on their fellow men and women.
[00:51:46.361 --> 00:51:50.542]  But they were a cohesive unit operating in a much wider network.
[00:51:51.042 --> 00:51:57.928]  That we're all working together to increase their own collective power at the expense of others' rights and freedoms.
[00:51:58.288 --> 00:52:04.773]  And it involved people from every single institutional walk of society.
[00:52:05.134 --> 00:52:14.021]  You name the institution, from military, to law, to law enforcement, to medicine, to entertainment, to, you know, police.
[00:52:14.821 --> 00:52:16.583]  You name the institution.
[00:52:17.223 --> 00:52:52.422]   There were people at high positions of influence and power involved in the grottos that I attended, attending satanic rituals, attending satanic meetings and groups and planning how to further Expand their power and upon realizing that that's what this was that this was something that was really attempting to take people's mindset to break it down to get them not to understand what was really going on around them and to ultimately long term put them into a state of servitude and slavery.
[00:52:52.982 --> 00:52:57.523]  That's where my conscience sort of began to awaken and activate.
[00:52:58.023 --> 00:53:01.764]  And I was basically saying, I didn't sign up for human slavery.
[00:53:01.884 --> 00:53:04.825]  I signed up to understand secrets of occultism.
[00:53:04.905 --> 00:53:13.247]  I signed up to understand how these are psychological aspects that if one knows, they could wield them and gain advantage over others.
[00:53:13.307 --> 00:53:17.208]  Because in my youth, I was very egotistical and wanted things like that.
[00:53:17.268 --> 00:53:18.568]  I wanted knowledge like that.
[00:53:18.988 --> 00:53:19.148]  Okay?
[00:53:19.168 --> 00:53:21.609]  And I wanted to wield it and use it to my own advantage.
[00:53:22.009 --> 00:53:24.891]  But I never signed up for human slavery, right?
[00:53:25.251 --> 00:53:32.695]  So when I understood that that's really what it was about, yeah, there you see my actual appointment and not in my actual legal name.
[00:53:32.775 --> 00:53:35.056]  I used a pseudonym at the time, Mark Rokar.
[00:53:35.757 --> 00:53:39.058]  So I am Mark Rokar of the Church of Satan.
[00:53:39.359 --> 00:53:45.462]  That is the name that I used in those days because I did not want to be even associated with my family name at the time.
[00:53:46.002 --> 00:53:52.706]  I sort of resented the family name and was rebelling against my family and the upbringing that they had given me.
[00:53:53.067 --> 00:53:55.288]  So I wanted to completely wipe all of that out.
[00:53:55.328 --> 00:53:57.730]  I wanted to completely have a new identity.
[00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:08.437]  And I chose that name, Rokar, because it is a demon name of one of the demon rulers of hell being named in the Gnostic test.
[00:54:08.577 --> 00:54:09.297]  You wanted to be reborn.
[00:54:09.317 --> 00:54:09.717]  Reborn.
[00:54:11.297 --> 00:54:20.905]  Yes, that name comes from the Gnostic text, the Pistis Sophia, or the Faith Wisdom, where Jesus is describing the levels of hell to Mary Magdalene.
[00:54:21.226 --> 00:54:22.827]  And so that's where I chose that name.
[00:54:22.967 --> 00:54:31.514]  So, a lot of people have tried to research my background and realized there is no Mark Passio in the Church of Satan, and that's because I went under the pseudonym Mark Rokar.
[00:54:31.554 --> 00:54:34.217]  I was known as Reverend Mark Rokar in those days.
[00:54:35.086 --> 00:54:40.169]  Well, the reason this is important is they advertise Satanism in the whole vein of it is.
[00:54:40.429 --> 00:54:41.509]  We're really just libertarians.
[00:54:41.529 --> 00:54:42.390]  We don't believe in God.
[00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:45.872]  We're about human empowerment and showing you the secrets.
[00:54:45.932 --> 00:54:49.314]  But then you find out, no, it's actually a cult to control people.
[00:54:49.914 --> 00:54:55.477]  And obviously, it was kicked into the CIA and a bunch of other organizations for my own research.
[00:54:55.597 --> 00:54:59.579]  And I never officially was in the Church of Satan or any of that when I was really young.
[00:54:59.599 --> 00:55:00.420]  And I've told this story before.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:01.160]  I'll just briefly tell it.
[00:55:02.113 --> 00:55:07.553]   I got immediately recruited right into the higher levels of it using sex operatives.
[00:55:07.553 --> 00:55:11.833]   I looked like I was 16, but I was 13, 14, and I was like, "These are really beautiful
[00:55:11.833 --> 00:55:12.833]  women."
[00:55:12.833 --> 00:55:16.472]   I mean, some were like full-grown 25-year-old women by the time I was about 15.
[00:55:16.472 --> 00:55:18.913]   And it just always went right back to, "Hey, we're going to this thing.
[00:55:18.913 --> 00:55:19.913]  Hey, we're going to love you.
[00:55:19.913 --> 00:55:21.233]  You need to be part of Satanism.
[00:55:21.233 --> 00:55:22.312]  It's really fun."
[00:55:22.312 --> 00:55:24.433]  And that was in Rockwall, Texas, outside Dallas.
[00:55:24.433 --> 00:55:28.913]   So from what you talk about is what Ted Gunnarsson exposed, high-level FBI, is you scratch the
[00:55:28.913 --> 00:55:32.913]   surface, these satanic cults are all over the place, and you were in one of the main
[00:55:32.913 --> 00:55:33.593]  veins of it.
[00:55:33.593 --> 00:55:43.593]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:49.621]  Yes, I want to make clear to the viewing audience, the listening audience, that in no way would I say that the Church of Satan is very high up in the overarching, worldwide satanic network or hierarchy.
[00:55:50.122 --> 00:56:03.432]  It is what I refer to as a psychological vetting and filtration system, where they are looking for people that they can groom up into those higher ranks of the satanic network.
[00:56:04.172 --> 00:56:05.954]  It is not high up itself.
[00:56:06.435 --> 00:56:14.744]  I admittedly say I was at what I call the Boy Scout level, the Cub Scout level of the satanic hierarchy and the satanic network that operates worldwide.
[00:56:14.764 --> 00:56:23.193]  From your research, why do you think, because the stuff I was getting rubbed into was billionaires and people with helicopter pads and stuff, why do you think I got rubbed right into high level?
[00:56:25.474 --> 00:56:26.515]  It's difficult to say.
[00:56:26.615 --> 00:56:30.337]  They tap people for different reasons and different capabilities.
[00:56:32.218 --> 00:56:42.123]  I would assume that someone knew you, your background, perhaps members of your family, and they decided to go directly to that level of grooming.
[00:56:42.563 --> 00:56:54.970]  For me, it was gaining a psychological profile on a person by what you write about in your application, which is an extensive psychological profiling tactic for the Church of Satan.
[00:56:55.730 --> 00:57:04.955]  If you read their actual application, it goes into extreme detail about your life, your preferences, your current mindset, etc.
[00:57:05.775 --> 00:57:32.380]  And then when they, you know, obviously then began to know me personally from attendance at rituals, then they can further psychologically vet you and see how well you fit the profile of people that they're looking for with certain psychopathic tendencies and with also certain capabilities such as communication, technological, being able to explain the ideology to others and reel more people into the satanic ideology, the satanic mindset.
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:33.982]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:57:34.002 --> 00:57:38.692]  I want to get into the current events and your greatest hits right now, all the key things you're covering that are so important.
[00:57:38.712 --> 00:57:43.503]  But just in a minute or so, accelerate through this awakening you had and what happened.
[00:57:44.941 --> 00:57:58.987]  So when I expressed that I had a moral problem with the control that they wanted to implement because they were very, very candid about, you know, what they really wanted to do, what their long term goals were.
[00:57:59.567 --> 00:58:06.170]  And when I said I have a moral problem with that, they basically said, well, there's the door and don't let it hit you on the rear end on the way out.
[00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:18.334]   In so many words, people think that when you choose to leave something like this, at least at my level of involvement, You are not, like, killed or you're not threatened with death.
[00:58:19.114 --> 00:58:24.916]  They actually said to me, literally, the words, Do you think we need you, boy?
[00:58:25.496 --> 00:58:31.957]  Those words were spoken directly to my face from individuals that were higher up in the hierarchy.
[00:58:32.197 --> 00:58:37.499]  When I expressed a moral problem with what they were doing, they actually said, Do you think we need you, boy?
[00:58:37.939 --> 00:58:38.639]  There's the door.
[00:58:39.359 --> 00:58:47.263]  And, you know, go ahead and knock yourself out, you know, banging your head against the wall for the rest of your life.
[00:58:47.283 --> 00:58:48.044]  Incredible, incredible.
[00:58:48.064 --> 00:58:48.824]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:48.844 --> 00:58:49.965]  We'll talk about this when we come back.
[00:58:49.985 --> 00:58:50.505]  This is amazing.
[00:58:51.499 --> 00:58:58.101]  Alright, we're going to hit some current events with Mark Passio, Natural Law, PsyOps, he's a really smart, articulate guy, he knows what he's talking about.
[00:58:58.862 --> 00:59:06.124]  And there's this whole network, basically run by intelligence agencies, that are nothing but a new version of the old cults.
[00:59:06.184 --> 00:59:09.965]  The cults were psychological, private intelligence agencies manipulating people.
[00:59:10.326 --> 00:59:12.846]  So it's not like the CIA runs the Satanists.
[00:59:12.846 --> 00:59:17.286]   The Satanists run the highest levels of the CIA and they're in the military, they're everywhere,
[00:59:17.286 --> 00:59:20.965]   and they're operating right next to normal people, the black hats and the white hats.
[00:59:20.965 --> 00:59:26.925]   And right now they're busy getting rid of the white hats and going from beta to their externalization
[00:59:26.925 --> 00:59:27.925]  of the takeover.
[00:59:27.925 --> 00:59:33.844]   That's why you see the pedophilia, the world government, all the evil, the anti-God, anti-human,
[00:59:33.844 --> 00:59:39.065]   post-humanist system, because now the real religion of transhumanism is here.
[00:59:39.065 --> 00:59:44.286]   So Mark Passio, before he hits current events, wanted to get into his awakening,
[00:59:44.286 --> 00:59:49.684]   getting out of the church of Satan, and delving really deep into the mysteries
[00:59:49.684 --> 00:59:50.846]  and what he discovered.
[00:59:50.846 --> 00:59:59.126]   So, you know, after I expressed that I had a moral issue with their long-term goals and their long-term agenda,
[00:59:59.126 --> 01:00:04.025]   and I walked away from the church of Satan and dark occultism in general,
[01:00:04.025 --> 01:00:12.817]   people would think that I would naturally, like, you know, Have any more interest in the occult and try to completely eliminate that from my life.
[01:00:12.857 --> 01:00:14.238]  That's not what I did.
[01:00:14.818 --> 01:00:31.266]  I actually went far deeper into occult knowledge and I kept, you know, scratching away, ripping away like layers of an onion going deeper and deeper and deeper to the real core of it until I discovered what they were really hiding from the rest of the world.
[01:00:31.807 --> 01:00:34.008]  And that was the knowledge of natural law.
[01:00:34.828 --> 01:00:45.895]  These people are trying to do anything to prevent a true awakening through the awakening to how natural law actually works and functions in our reality.
[01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:47.716]  They want anything but that.
[01:00:47.836 --> 01:00:51.198]  They want us analyzing every aspect of the control system.
[01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:56.441]  You know, this is the equivalent of a doctor endlessly looking at a tumor.
[01:00:56.921 --> 01:01:03.063]  And never actually trying to do anything to actually get rid of the underlying cause of the cancer, of the tumor, right?
[01:01:03.403 --> 01:01:04.223]  That's what they want.
[01:01:04.263 --> 01:01:08.704]  They want us focused on all of the little minutia that forms the control system.
[01:01:09.064 --> 01:01:11.845]  But they don't want us to look at causal factors.
[01:01:12.185 --> 01:01:18.327]  And this is what delving even deeper into the world of occult knowledge finally revealed unto me.
[01:01:18.707 --> 01:01:21.847]  And it has for many, many, many other researchers throughout time.
[01:01:21.907 --> 01:01:23.628]  It's nothing special in my regard.
[01:01:24.168 --> 01:01:42.169]  But by going deeper into this knowledge, I understood, wow, these people are actually trying to hold back the knowledge of how natural law really works, and how it brings to us the experiences that we are actually creating by putting certain behaviors out into the world.
[01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:46.431]  So I discovered that this is a cause and effect relationship.
[01:01:46.471 --> 01:01:48.012]  That is how natural law functions.
[01:01:48.072 --> 01:01:51.034]  It's the real laws of karma.
[01:01:51.354 --> 01:01:53.455]  It's the real laws of attraction.
[01:01:53.495 --> 01:01:57.017]  It's the real laws of consequence in our lives.
[01:01:57.598 --> 01:02:10.365]  We act through our behavior and then we receive consequences that are structured and organized from the universe that bring the results and the effects of the behaviors that we have put out into the world.
[01:02:11.025 --> 01:02:39.711]   Based on whether those behaviors were truly moral or whether they were truly immoral and that brings the dichotomy between religion and a true understanding of natural law because religion has told us through the ages that there are certain forms of sin, certain forms of transgression against others and it'll come down to us in the form like let's say through Christianity or Catholicism like The seven deadly sins, okay?
[01:02:40.011 --> 01:02:43.474]  Pride, gluttony, sloth, lust, anger, jealousy, greed.
[01:02:43.755 --> 01:02:48.979]  We're taught that these vices are actually sins and transgressions.
[01:02:49.419 --> 01:02:55.445]  When in fact, it eliminates the natural law component and gives us something a proxy in its place.
[01:02:56.125 --> 01:03:15.484]  Under true natural law, we learn that behaviors that actually initiate some form of aggression against our fellow beings are the true transgressions against natural law that create negative consequence in our life, both individually and at an aggregate.
[01:03:15.624 --> 01:03:17.846]  So do unto others as you'd have done unto you.
[01:03:19.133 --> 01:03:24.596]  Yeah, I would say I would word it in the apophatic or in the negative variation.
[01:03:25.077 --> 01:03:31.401]  So when you when you try to philosophize apophatically, you describe what something is not right.
[01:03:31.661 --> 01:03:42.648]  So we describe a right is something that you have a right, an action that you have a right to take because it does not initiate harm against another sentient being.
[01:03:42.788 --> 01:03:42.948]  Right.
[01:03:43.288 --> 01:03:46.210]  So then you have to know what are those don'ts?
[01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:47.191]  What are the nots?
[01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:51.353]  What are the things that do initiate aggression against other sentient beings?
[01:03:51.654 --> 01:03:54.095]  That's how you and how natural law is revealed.
[01:03:54.395 --> 01:04:02.561]  I would word the golden rule as do not do unto others that which you do not want others to do to you.
[01:04:02.941 --> 01:04:05.303]  Then it becomes very unambiguous and clear.
[01:04:05.443 --> 01:04:07.004]  Nobody wants to be stolen from.
[01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:08.885]  Nobody wants their rights taken away.
[01:04:09.245 --> 01:04:11.027]  Nobody wants to be harmed physically.
[01:04:11.107 --> 01:04:12.968]  Nobody wants their life snuffed out.
[01:04:13.668 --> 01:04:18.090]  These are true transgressions against natural law because they initiate harm against another.
[01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:24.191]  And that's the big satanic lie, that you can hurt people and not have it come back on you, and you can somehow have a Faustian bargain.
[01:04:24.211 --> 01:04:33.534]  The whole Bohemian Grove ritual is about they're able to do bad, and then somehow they karmically put it onto this child they're sacrificing in simulation, but that's a fraud.
[01:04:33.574 --> 01:04:34.735]  There's no way to protect yourself.
[01:04:34.975 --> 01:04:35.875]  It's going to come back on you.
[01:04:36.843 --> 01:04:41.585]  That's an ancient Babylonian and Carthaginian absolution ritual.
[01:04:41.626 --> 01:04:44.307]  It's a self-absolution ritual, as you said.
[01:04:44.707 --> 01:04:55.393]  They are actually forgiving themselves for the evils that they are about to do through that Bohemian Grove ritual of the sacrifice of dull care, as they call it.
[01:04:55.413 --> 01:04:57.814]  And they were taking it extremely seriously.
[01:04:58.734 --> 01:05:03.457]  These men were in, I would call it, a crazed trance.
[01:05:05.515 --> 01:05:06.035]  Oh, of course.
[01:05:06.115 --> 01:05:09.356]  I mean, dark occultists take, this is their religion.
[01:05:09.676 --> 01:05:14.478]  I mean, make no mistake about it, this is the religion that runs the world, Satanism.
[01:05:15.138 --> 01:05:17.159]  And that's what people have to really wake up to.
[01:05:17.299 --> 01:05:23.301]  And then they have to wake up to true morality, because aggregate morality determines aggregate freedom.
[01:05:23.781 --> 01:05:29.563]  As people in the aggregate, in the collective of humanity, become more moral, they will become more free.
[01:05:30.163 --> 01:05:34.107]  We are enslaved as a people because we have not been moral as a people.
[01:05:34.467 --> 01:05:39.192]  And the real transgressions against natural law are murder, assault, rape.
[01:05:39.807 --> 01:05:43.529]  Theft, trespass, coercion, and deception.
[01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:48.392]  These are the things that if we engage in, we are harming other people.
[01:05:48.593 --> 01:05:49.893]  We are harming other beings.
[01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:53.816]  We are engaged in taking away their property, their rights, their life, etc.
[01:05:54.036 --> 01:06:02.001]  All of those transgressions, murder, assault, rape, theft, trespass, coercion, and deception, are forms of theft.
[01:06:02.721 --> 01:06:08.365]  They are taking something that we do not have the right to take because it is not our rightful property to take.
[01:06:08.585 --> 01:06:09.046]  Absolutely.
[01:06:09.066 --> 01:06:10.747]  And then we really trespass against ourselves.
[01:06:11.247 --> 01:06:14.189]  So the minute we have to break, we'll come back and talk more about this.
[01:06:14.209 --> 01:06:16.851]  Forced injections with something they know is poisonous and hurts people.
[01:06:17.311 --> 01:06:18.312]  That's a trespass.
[01:06:18.352 --> 01:06:19.193]  That's a deception.
[01:06:19.593 --> 01:06:20.333]  That's a murder.
[01:06:20.413 --> 01:06:21.054]  Why are they doing it?
[01:06:22.515 --> 01:06:23.236]  It's eugenics.
[01:06:23.536 --> 01:06:27.859]  I mean, this is absolute modern eugenics, just as the Nazis practiced it.
[01:06:28.479 --> 01:06:36.685]  People, the globalist technocrats, I call them the technocratic occultocracy, the occult ruling class.
[01:06:37.065 --> 01:06:39.427]  They are engaged in modern eugenics.
[01:06:39.707 --> 01:06:50.235]  This is nothing more than a new eugenics operation being waged against humanity to degrade and eventually wipe out the human immune system and eventually thin the population.
[01:06:50.655 --> 01:06:59.700]  And I think they've gotten a lot of people on that hook, unfortunately, and a lot of people are going to suffer as a result of buying into their propaganda and taking those poison shots.
[01:07:00.301 --> 01:07:02.522]  Riveting information with Mark Passio.
[01:07:03.222 --> 01:07:06.044]  What on Earth is happening dot com.
[01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:07.725]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars dot com.
[01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:09.606]  What on Earth is happening dot com.
[01:07:09.926 --> 01:07:12.528]  And after this amazing interview is over, it'll be archived at Bandai Video.
[01:07:12.548 --> 01:07:13.208]  Be sure to share it.
[01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:14.769]  This guy knows what he's talking about.
[01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:19.192]  With Mark Passio of What on Earth is Happening.
[01:07:20.057 --> 01:07:20.597]  All right, Mark.
[01:07:20.937 --> 01:07:22.038]  We've got two segments left.
[01:07:22.058 --> 01:07:23.759]  We're going to do a commercial-free podcast.
[01:07:24.519 --> 01:07:26.380]  You said you'll do it in the next few weeks for like two hours.
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.981]  You can really lay all this out, but you know what you're talking about.
[01:07:29.001 --> 01:07:33.723]  There's so many current topics, so many things to expose what's happening, how the globalists are operating.
[01:07:33.743 --> 01:07:45.589]  I want you to be able to go over the points you want to make, but big picture, this big emergence, this coming out in the open, this taking off of the mask, this open assault on everything good and decent, and this assault on common sense and truth.
[01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:49.232]  It looks like the cult's trying to fully take over.
[01:07:49.312 --> 01:07:51.595]  I think because they know there's an awakening happening.
[01:07:52.175 --> 01:07:54.478]  Please speak to that after you've made your other points.
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.081]  Sure, I'll go right to that.
[01:07:57.941 --> 01:08:06.985]  Inside the world of the occult, there is a subtle difference between different factions, a subtle differing.
[01:08:07.005 --> 01:08:09.246]  I wouldn't say it's an outright war.
[01:08:09.746 --> 01:08:16.470]  It's a difference of approach to coming out into open rulership.
[01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:18.150]  Some people favor that.
[01:08:18.490 --> 01:08:23.833]  They call this in the world of the occult, the externalization of the hierarchy.
[01:08:24.313 --> 01:08:29.600]  And it means that they're revealing that there's a hierarchy of rulership in the world.
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:37.371]  That they are ruling class and under them are the people that they consider their servants, their subjects, their slaves.
[01:08:37.391 --> 01:08:38.773]  And that's what Klaus Schwab is doing.
[01:08:39.113 --> 01:08:40.315]  They're just putting it out there in the open.
[01:08:41.286 --> 01:08:42.407]  That is exactly right.
[01:08:42.727 --> 01:08:50.935]  These technocratic occultists want to come out and openly rule humanity as the new kings, the new gods, the new pharaohs.
[01:08:51.295 --> 01:08:57.460]  However you want to word it or look at it, they want to externalize their power and tell people, you're our slaves.
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.161]  We own you.
[01:08:58.281 --> 01:08:59.202]  We are your rulers.
[01:08:59.782 --> 01:09:12.792]  Some do not favor that approach and want to remain to keep it hidden, to keep it occulted, to keep it on a covert level of rulership as we have had for many, many, many centuries now.
[01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:20.738]  And there's this subtle war, you could say, going on within the rank and file of the dark occult world.
[01:09:21.158 --> 01:09:32.943]  Where some of them favor staying in the shadows, operating through covert means, and some of them want open, externalized rulership, which they call the externalization of the hierarchy.
[01:09:33.383 --> 01:09:50.471]  I believe the factions who are doing these public displays, who are actually wanting to come out into the open and just tell people, hey, we're going to have a technotronic means of owning what you think, of reducing your mind to a form of a computer algorithm.
[01:09:50.911 --> 01:09:55.595]  They are the people who favor the externalization of the hierarchy and the dark occult.
[01:09:56.756 --> 01:09:57.417]  Please continue.
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:11.526]  So yes, I made a documentary to try to explain the causal factors of what people need to understand in order to reverse the current human condition that is tending towards slavery.
[01:10:12.127 --> 01:10:13.367]  And that is natural law.
[01:10:13.527 --> 01:10:19.871]  I made a documentary called Mark Passio and the Science of Natural Law in which I very briefly talk about my background.
[01:10:19.911 --> 01:10:22.192]  That's not the important part of the documentary.
[01:10:22.532 --> 01:10:35.159]  It's about an hour and ten minute long documentary, but after I just very briefly break down my basic background in the occult world, I then talk about natural law, what it is, and why they want to keep it hidden from people.
[01:10:35.559 --> 01:10:47.245]  If people don't understand natural law, they cannot truly understand in their own mind the true causal factors that are needed to be understood in order for a true awakening to happen.
[01:10:48.526 --> 01:10:50.368]  I take a little bit of a different approach.
[01:10:50.548 --> 01:10:56.452]  I don't necessarily think that the occult is fearful that there's an awakening right now.
[01:10:56.932 --> 01:11:09.401]   I think that they are fearful that there could be an awakening, a true spiritual awakening, to their plans, their agenda, and what really needs to be understood to truly destroy I totally agree with you.
[01:11:09.421 --> 01:11:10.202]  That's where I'm at.
[01:11:10.282 --> 01:11:19.325]  They're behind schedule and that's made the faction that wants to take over accelerated or accelerationist with their externalization of the hierarchy because they believe they're losing.
[01:11:21.105 --> 01:11:27.188]  I think that they think that the information that could bring them down could come out in a wide way.
[01:11:27.428 --> 01:11:30.249]  And that is the information that I cover in my documentary.
[01:11:30.569 --> 01:11:31.929]  It's all about natural law.
[01:11:32.029 --> 01:11:36.631]  If people understand natural law, they understand causal dynamics.
[01:11:37.191 --> 01:11:52.807]  They understand the ultimate governing dynamics of creation and how we will create a different reality, not based on the same systems of control, but based on mutual respect, based on voluntary interaction with other human beings.
[01:11:52.827 --> 01:11:58.212]  The real magic is being a good person that knows these laws, then the whole universe changes.
[01:11:58.232 --> 01:12:00.895]  And until people get that, the enemy is going to keep winning.
[01:12:02.252 --> 01:12:02.953]  Without a doubt.
[01:12:03.033 --> 01:12:04.594]  And Alex, that's why I want to commend you.
[01:12:05.175 --> 01:12:10.599]  Before, you know, the last time that we spoke on air, I don't think Reset Wars had been out.
[01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:13.181]  I think it's the finest work that you've done.
[01:12:13.201 --> 01:12:20.627]  I think it's something that more and more people need to see because it explains a lot of these dynamics in Reset Wars as well.
[01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:25.511]  And I wanted to really commend you on that work because it was very, very, very finely done.
[01:12:25.851 --> 01:12:27.052]  I thought it was my most important work.
[01:12:27.112 --> 01:12:29.613]  It did okay, but I think people didn't see it.
[01:12:30.093 --> 01:12:31.154]  It's proven by science.
[01:12:31.214 --> 01:12:32.894]  It's proven by quantum mechanics, as you know.
[01:12:32.914 --> 01:12:34.315]  I mean, this is real.
[01:12:34.415 --> 01:12:44.360]  The enemy knows this, and I was showing it from a scientific perspective, which, as you say, the occult's just the ancient way of seeing it, and a lot of folks really got something from it, but it really is the secret.
[01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:46.091]  Absolutely.
[01:12:46.311 --> 01:12:49.433]  That's why I call my documentary The Science of Natural Law.
[01:12:49.893 --> 01:12:51.294]  It is not a faith-based system.
[01:12:51.354 --> 01:12:55.737]  It is the way the actual laws of creation in the universe function.
[01:12:56.177 --> 01:13:01.301]  And they're not put here by the creator of the universe to torment us that we can never know them.
[01:13:01.741 --> 01:13:02.803]  We are meant to know them.
[01:13:02.843 --> 01:13:05.786]  They are meant to be revealed unto us and for us to understand them.
[01:13:06.067 --> 01:13:09.892]  Because these laws are here for our maximum benefit in creation.
[01:13:09.932 --> 01:13:10.292]  That's right.
[01:13:10.332 --> 01:13:11.874]  We can't move the next level.
[01:13:12.215 --> 01:13:14.237]  We can't move the incredible next level of humanity.
[01:13:14.257 --> 01:13:15.078]  Look how far we've come.
[01:13:15.399 --> 01:13:17.141]  Without knowing these, we'll kill each other.
[01:13:18.132 --> 01:13:21.673]  Without a doubt, you have to understand these universal principles and laws.
[01:13:21.693 --> 01:13:33.298]  And that's why I say, before people look at implementing any solution, no matter what it is, no matter how simple or no matter how complex it is, you have to get first principles under your belt first.
[01:13:33.318 --> 01:13:38.278]   You have to get first principles laid as the foundation for which everything else stands upon,
[01:13:38.278 --> 01:13:42.358]   or you have no solid groundwork, you have no solid structure to build
[01:13:42.358 --> 01:13:43.997]  whatever you're going to build upon it.
[01:13:43.997 --> 01:13:46.118]  And that's what natural law is all about.
[01:13:46.118 --> 01:13:51.997]   It's getting the moral laws of creation deeply understood and deeply ingrained
[01:13:51.997 --> 01:13:56.356]   into one's consciousness, so then you can align your behavior to it.
[01:13:56.356 --> 01:14:00.378]   You understand them, then you align your behavior to those laws.
[01:14:00.378 --> 01:14:04.757]   When we do that, we're going to create a world based in freedom and prosperity.
[01:14:04.757 --> 01:14:08.238]   If we don't do that, a world based in freedom and prosperity
[01:14:08.238 --> 01:14:14.637]   is actually impossible to attain to, because in order for that outcome to be present,
[01:14:14.637 --> 01:14:18.077]   the causal factors that lead to that outcome have to be laid down.
[01:14:18.295 --> 01:14:26.803]  And you can't lay down a free society, a prosperous society, unless it's laid down upon the foundation of natural, moral, universal law.
[01:14:26.903 --> 01:14:30.847]  It is impossible, according to the laws of the creator of the universe, to do that.
[01:14:31.327 --> 01:14:32.588]  And I watch your show all the time.
[01:14:33.308 --> 01:14:37.129]  You get frustrated because if people would just get this, it would end all the problems.
[01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.949]  It's right there.
[01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:48.933]  I call it the most important secret of secrets of every secret society that has ever existed in humanity.
[01:14:49.413 --> 01:14:56.156]  This is what the secret societies throughout all of humanity were trying to hide from human beings.
[01:14:56.836 --> 01:15:16.101]  They fought for whatever reasons, people couldn't be entrusted with it, they wouldn't treat the information respectfully and do things with it in a responsible capacity, or the dark occultists wanted to hide it so they can gain an advantage over their fellow men and women and rule them, put them under their thumb and rule them as their slaves, you know?
[01:15:16.581 --> 01:15:19.262]  So, both sides wanted to hide this.
[01:15:19.842 --> 01:15:23.623]  Light Occult and Dark Occult for very different reasons.
[01:15:24.083 --> 01:15:26.024]  That's why I don't call myself an occultist.
[01:15:26.424 --> 01:15:28.844]  I call myself a de-occultist.
[01:15:29.344 --> 01:15:32.165]  I am taking this information out of hiding.
[01:15:32.485 --> 01:15:34.226]  I'm taking it out of secrecy.
[01:15:34.646 --> 01:15:43.748]  And I'm just bursting it forward onto the world as widely and as freely as I can through technology, through my podcast, through my website, through my network.
[01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:48.889]  And I am just trying to get the word out to people in an egalitarian fashion.
[01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:51.450]  That's how you make informed decisions.
[01:15:51.490 --> 01:16:03.494]  You get all the information, you put it all together, you look at it, you weed out logical inconsistencies if there are any, and then you decide what it means, and then you inform your behavior and you act upon it.
[01:16:03.614 --> 01:16:05.814]  Unless we don't have the information, we can't do that.
[01:16:08.502 --> 01:16:13.546]  They call it the Illuminati illumination, but they're actually trying to keep it all dark so you don't know.
[01:16:14.086 --> 01:16:19.891]  So the so-called Illuminati is trying to hide things, but we the people waking up is the real Illuminati.
[01:16:20.171 --> 01:16:26.276]  Not saying we're the Illuminati, but to use that term, we are trying to really illuminate and in the secrets and bring it out.
[01:16:27.196 --> 01:16:28.878]  That's exactly correct, Alex.
[01:16:29.478 --> 01:16:34.143]  I hate the term Illuminati applied to the dark occultists because they are not enlightened.
[01:16:34.563 --> 01:16:36.946]  The word Illuminati just means the enlightened ones.
[01:16:37.246 --> 01:16:38.527]  They're not the enlightened ones.
[01:16:38.567 --> 01:16:46.355]  The people who truly gain the knowledge of natural law, use it wisely, help spread it to other people so that they can awaken, they're the real Illuminati.
[01:16:46.475 --> 01:16:47.016]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:48.092 --> 01:16:53.258]  Well I had Mark Passione a couple years ago and I meant to get him back on and then two years went by like ten seconds but I promise he said he'll do it.
[01:16:53.278 --> 01:16:56.603]  In the next two weeks we'll do two hour commercial free podcast.
[01:16:57.163 --> 01:16:58.885]  We'll air major clips here on the show.
[01:16:58.925 --> 01:17:01.028]  I've got a million questions in the ten minutes we have left.
[01:17:01.609 --> 01:17:04.813]  In this segment we'll do five more minutes ahead of Steve Quill joining us on the other side of this.
[01:17:05.453 --> 01:17:15.551]   But Mark Passione, Looking at the endgame of this and studying deeply into the occult, obviously there's, you know, God the creator, this force of good that gives us the laws.
[01:17:16.511 --> 01:17:21.751]   Is it our own evil manifestations and our will, made in the image of God, to create
[01:17:21.751 --> 01:17:28.071]   things that is like fantastic planet where they're actually building the demons themselves
[01:17:28.071 --> 01:17:29.530]  with their own will?
[01:17:29.530 --> 01:17:31.311]  Or is there inter-dimensionals?
[01:17:31.311 --> 01:17:32.311]  Are there aliens?
[01:17:32.311 --> 01:17:38.311]   Because I know from people having group ayahuasca trips where 50 people see the same thing.
[01:17:38.311 --> 01:17:41.030]  From my research, there is evil forces.
[01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:46.911]   There are things other than human out there that fits into the whole Christian cosmology
[01:17:46.911 --> 01:17:48.231]  which actually backs that up.
[01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:52.630]   Not the Christian churches and the controlled systems, but the reality of there is a God,
[01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:56.190]   there is an evil force, God allows evil to operate, because of free will.
[01:17:56.190 --> 01:17:57.511]  What's your view on that?
[01:17:57.511 --> 01:18:02.471]   Yes, I've been asked this many times and I think there's elements of both of those things.
[01:18:02.451 --> 01:18:10.639]  Of course there is, of course, free will for us to decide how we are going to create collectively our reality here on this planet together.
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:18.728]  But yes, there are perhaps non-corporeal entities, extraterrestrial, extra-dimensional.
[01:18:19.188 --> 01:18:21.950]  I do get into that a bit in my work, but guess what?
[01:18:21.970 --> 01:18:28.494]  I don't really focus on it too much because I tell people that the solution is going to be the same.
[01:18:28.894 --> 01:18:31.016]  The solution is to say no to evil.
[01:18:31.396 --> 01:18:33.937]  The solution is to not participate in the work.
[01:18:34.057 --> 01:18:34.478]  Exactly.
[01:18:34.558 --> 01:18:39.621]  Just because there's rattlesnakes in Arizona in holes in the ground, just don't stick your arm down the hole.
[01:18:40.635 --> 01:18:40.835]  Right.
[01:18:41.015 --> 01:18:52.479]  We have to build our spiritual strength and shielding to not get fooled into believing that evil is necessary and evil is somehow doing something that is good.
[01:18:53.279 --> 01:19:02.322]  If it's harming someone, if it's initiating harm, if it's coercing, if it's not consensual, if it is based on coercion... So God doesn't just let evil run around.
[01:19:02.682 --> 01:19:04.203]  We allow it to do it by our free will.
[01:19:05.126 --> 01:19:05.846]  That is correct.
[01:19:05.886 --> 01:19:08.528]  See, the Creator is perfect love.
[01:19:09.128 --> 01:19:19.473]  The Creator has placed the laws of creation here, including natural law, to elicit our maximum benefit.
[01:19:20.053 --> 01:19:23.315]  It's not there as a constraint or a prison, per se.
[01:19:23.895 --> 01:19:28.478]  It is there to allow us to learn what not to do.
[01:19:28.798 --> 01:19:33.481]  It's like, you know, is it a prison that a flame will burn someone's flesh of their hand?
[01:19:33.581 --> 01:19:34.421]  That's not a prison.
[01:19:34.461 --> 01:19:37.183]  That doesn't mean that the flame is somehow evil.
[01:19:37.643 --> 01:19:38.443]  It's just hot.
[01:19:38.844 --> 01:19:43.026]  And the law is if you keep your flesh over top of it, you're going to get burnt.
[01:19:43.126 --> 01:19:45.207]  Then you're going to learn that's not a good thing to do.
[01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:50.410]  The Creator has gifted us with the greatest gift that any sentient being could possibly be gifted with.
[01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:51.631]  That is free will.
[01:19:52.171 --> 01:20:00.298]  That force, the creator of the creation, is not going to get involved in what decisions we make.
[01:20:00.719 --> 01:20:02.160]  That's why it gave us free will.
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:04.842]  It makes the law for consequence.
[01:20:05.142 --> 01:20:12.189]  It gives us free will whether to follow the law or be harmed as a result or receive negative consequence as a result.
[01:20:12.209 --> 01:20:13.029]  That's in our hands.
[01:20:13.249 --> 01:20:15.812]  The law is guardrails for us to learn about ourselves because we're free.
[01:20:16.966 --> 01:20:17.627]  Without a doubt.
[01:20:17.887 --> 01:20:21.291]  And if we learn it, it elicits our maximum benefit.
[01:20:21.331 --> 01:20:24.094]  If we refuse to learn it, we're going to get negative consequences.
[01:20:24.134 --> 01:20:25.396]  It's so very simple.
[01:20:25.716 --> 01:20:27.618]  It's like a computer code.
[01:20:28.019 --> 01:20:31.282]  It's been compared to laws of creation.
[01:20:31.563 --> 01:20:33.104]  It's not really a computer.
[01:20:33.365 --> 01:20:37.129]  It's a construct that you could say resembles the algorithms of a computer.
[01:20:37.489 --> 01:20:55.438]  But if we learn how the coding works, if we learn how the laws of the creator of the universe works, and it is possible to learn that, okay, through trial and error, through observation, through listening to wisdom of people that have gone through the process of figuring that out through a truth discovery method.
[01:20:55.858 --> 01:21:03.222]  It's revealed unto humanity, okay, and we can learn in many different ways, and I talk about this in my work, in my presentations, in my podcasts.
[01:21:03.562 --> 01:21:09.389]  But if we learn it and we align our behavior to it, we're going to receive the order that we seek.
[01:21:09.429 --> 01:21:10.670]  We're going to receive freedom.
[01:21:10.710 --> 01:21:12.112]  We're going to receive prosperity.
[01:21:12.553 --> 01:21:16.037]  If we refuse to learn those laws and we keep going...
[01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:26.813]  Against them, in their face, just flaunting them, going against them, refusing to align our behavior to them, thinking that we know better, thinking that we're going to get away with something.
[01:21:27.153 --> 01:21:28.754]  Nobody's going to get away with anything.
[01:21:29.094 --> 01:21:33.335]  It's just going to degrade the human condition further and further and further.
[01:21:33.715 --> 01:21:36.336]  Again, it's a very simple law of science.
[01:21:36.356 --> 01:21:37.136]  No, I totally agree.
[01:21:37.156 --> 01:21:38.877]  So where is humanity right now?
[01:21:39.337 --> 01:21:40.157]  Are you optimistic?
[01:21:40.177 --> 01:21:42.218]  I mean, how would you describe the current state?
[01:21:43.194 --> 01:21:47.817]  We are nowhere near learning the true causal factors in the aggregate.
[01:21:48.117 --> 01:21:50.119]  In fact, on average, people are rejecting it.
[01:21:50.379 --> 01:21:51.580]  That's all hell's breaking loose.
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:55.062]  That's exactly why we have the conditions that we have.
[01:21:55.142 --> 01:22:02.047]  We have to learn as a species that the sum of morality is proportional to the sum of freedom.
[01:22:02.127 --> 01:22:02.547]  That's it.
[01:22:02.607 --> 01:22:03.568]  That's the equation.
[01:22:03.948 --> 01:22:04.669]  Okay?
[01:22:04.689 --> 01:22:05.990]  Well, the founder said that.
[01:22:06.190 --> 01:22:07.511]  Only a moral people can be free.
[01:22:08.348 --> 01:22:09.028]  Without a doubt.
[01:22:09.088 --> 01:22:19.915]  They said that they were creating something that would only be for immoral people and would only be able to stand the test of time if the people remained moral and did not become debauched in their behavior.
[01:22:20.175 --> 01:22:21.436]  And that's really what we have.
[01:22:21.496 --> 01:22:26.259]  We have total dissent into unconsciousness.
[01:22:26.299 --> 01:22:28.200]  We have dissent into immorality.
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:33.423]  We have the belief in this authority system that has been created.
[01:22:33.803 --> 01:22:38.645]  You know, as if the creator of the universe is going to put some people in charge of other people.
[01:22:38.945 --> 01:22:45.767]  You know, these notions are completely, you know, and antithetical to how natural law really functions.
[01:22:45.867 --> 01:23:01.182]   We have to learn to do behavior that we No, definitively, is not initiating harm or removing or constraining the rights of other people or based in coercion or based in violence.
[01:23:01.422 --> 01:23:05.345]  The problem is people don't really know the difference between right and wrong behavior.
[01:23:05.625 --> 01:23:12.910]  They believe that they know, but they have a mind virus operating and telling them this is what good is.
[01:23:12.930 --> 01:23:15.532]  No, I totally agree, but it's paradoxical.
[01:23:15.552 --> 01:23:20.796]  I think we're coming to the end of the corruption cycle and the beginning of a rebirth that may go on for 10 years, 100 years.
[01:23:21.937 --> 01:23:25.279]  But there is an accelerated awakening in some people, but you're right.
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:28.442]  Some are waking up more, others are accelerating into idiocy.
[01:23:29.703 --> 01:23:30.283]  Absolutely.
[01:23:30.343 --> 01:23:32.805]  There are both things taking place simultaneously.
[01:23:33.245 --> 01:23:42.452]  I hope to accelerate the former where people wake up to the laws of creation, they wake up to the laws of morality, they wake up to the laws of cause and effect and consequence.
[01:23:42.952 --> 01:23:45.814]  It's just choice and consequence, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:48.136]  It's not really anything more complicated than that.
[01:23:48.536 --> 01:23:54.539]  If you choose to truly be on the side of right, you don't support things that are based in coercion and violence.
[01:23:54.879 --> 01:23:58.681]  If you're truly on the side of right, your behavior is going to be aligned to that.
[01:23:58.741 --> 01:24:02.443]  First and foremost, your mindset has to get aligned to true morality.
[01:24:02.763 --> 01:24:07.706]   Then you align your behavior to it, then you receive You know, a positive outcome.
[01:24:07.826 --> 01:24:10.949]  It's very, very simple when you really break natural law down.
[01:24:11.009 --> 01:24:11.730]  All right, stay there.
[01:24:12.210 --> 01:24:13.572]  We got one more little short segment.
[01:24:13.592 --> 01:24:16.434]  I want to talk about natural law and the forced injections.
[01:24:16.474 --> 01:24:19.137]  And as bad as it was, a lot of people capitulating.
[01:24:19.177 --> 01:24:21.319]  Now you have 99% of people refusing the shots.
[01:24:21.779 --> 01:24:22.460]  So evil nosy.
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.682]  You're going to run at something, but then we turn against it.
[01:24:24.942 --> 01:24:26.704]  We'll come back in a few minutes and talk about that.
[01:24:26.944 --> 01:24:30.067]  But in 30 seconds, how do people find the films you were talking about?
[01:24:31.181 --> 01:24:34.564]  You can go to my website, whatoneearthishappening.com.
[01:24:34.704 --> 01:24:38.767]  It's the number one video in the videos section of my website.
[01:24:38.967 --> 01:24:43.070]  It's called Mark Passio and the Science of Natural Law Documentary.
[01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:45.012]  It's about an hour and ten minutes long.
[01:24:45.372 --> 01:24:49.595]  It's probably one of the quickest and easiest watches anybody will ever do.
[01:24:49.975 --> 01:24:56.580]  And it will reveal the secret of all the secret societies throughout human history in that hour and ten minutes.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.161]  All right.
[01:24:57.681 --> 01:24:59.903]  We'll be right back to talk about PsyOps.
[01:24:59.963 --> 01:25:03.426]  We'll do a two-hour commercial-free show very soon when we pass you.
[01:25:03.466 --> 01:25:04.627]  I promise you, I'm not going to forget.
[01:25:04.667 --> 01:25:06.449]  Then two years goes by like 10 seconds.
[01:25:07.409 --> 01:25:07.970]  We're going to break.
[01:25:08.050 --> 01:25:09.971]  Please remember, we're under globalist attack.
[01:25:10.011 --> 01:25:12.353]  They're going to have some giant billion-dollar judgment against us.
[01:25:12.393 --> 01:25:13.935]  It's all deep state run to scare everybody.
[01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:16.237]  I see this as a very positive thing with all these attacks.
[01:25:16.617 --> 01:25:19.780]  As long as you understand that and persevere, folks, we're going to be here for a long time.
[01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:21.081]  But I am in your hands.
[01:25:21.601 --> 01:25:22.462]  So it's natural law.
[01:25:22.502 --> 01:25:23.162]  Support the truth.
[01:25:23.202 --> 01:25:24.063]  Support resistance.
[01:25:24.524 --> 01:25:25.264]  We will win together.
[01:25:25.324 --> 01:25:27.345]   If you don't, well, Then that's up to you.

[01:25:59.981 --> 01:26:01.442]  The globalists really hate us.
[01:26:01.482 --> 01:26:06.326]  They're really coming after us, but you've kept us on air this long and now is the critical time to support.
[01:26:06.386 --> 01:26:07.987]  So I want to thank those who have supported.

[01:26:39.817 --> 01:26:41.256]  Final segment with Mark Passio.
[01:26:41.256 --> 01:26:44.537]  We have a new Gregory's Report that just dropped.
[01:26:44.623 --> 01:26:46.084]  We're going to air it at the start of the next segment.
[01:26:46.704 --> 01:26:50.227]  The globalist depopulation agenda and the drive for World War III accelerates.
[01:26:50.868 --> 01:26:51.688]  There's the actual headline.
[01:26:51.708 --> 01:26:54.571]  The population agenda continues as world leaders prepare for nuclear war.
[01:26:54.591 --> 01:26:56.132]  It just went live about five minutes ago.
[01:26:56.612 --> 01:26:57.273]  It banned our video.
[01:26:57.293 --> 01:26:58.394]  We're going to premiere it here on air.
[01:26:58.734 --> 01:27:03.817]   And then, the one and only, the guy that Said even more stuff that came true than David Icke.
[01:27:04.398 --> 01:27:10.842]  Steve Quayle joins us for the Balance of the Hour, ahead of another great researcher, Jay Dyer, in the fourth hour.
[01:27:10.902 --> 01:27:15.544]  But Mark Passio, come back in the next few weeks and do PsyOps and current events and other things.
[01:27:15.564 --> 01:27:24.430]  We can do the whole history thing as well, but just looking at the PsyOps and what's going on, I see desperateness in the New World Order.
[01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:26.091]  What do you want to say in closing?
[01:27:27.682 --> 01:27:29.023]  Well, they're PSYOPs.
[01:27:29.043 --> 01:27:36.007]  They have to keep injecting fear into the population to keep them ignorant and to keep them listening to their narrative.
[01:27:36.387 --> 01:27:38.328]  You know, there's many different kinds of PSYOPs.
[01:27:38.368 --> 01:27:41.410]  There's PSYOPs to demoralize a population.
[01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:43.872]  There's PSYOPs to inject fear.
[01:27:43.932 --> 01:27:49.555]  There's PSYOPs to put disinformation out there and get people to latch on to erroneous ideas.
[01:27:50.155 --> 01:27:58.964]  And then there's PSYOPs to get people to stand down and not take right action and believe that some external power has it in hand and they're going to take care of it.
[01:28:00.465 --> 01:28:01.746]  Yeah, that's one of them.
[01:28:01.846 --> 01:28:14.078]  You know, there's many, many, many different forms that PSYOPs takes and many reasons that this globalist, you know, satanic syndicate has to keep doing these things that keep people fooled and keep them confused.
[01:28:14.138 --> 01:28:26.546]   But most of all, The main reason they conduct these things is they don't want people stopping and figuring out natural law mentally in their mind and then aligning their behavior to it.
[01:28:26.967 --> 01:28:33.231]  That is the thing that would ultimately destroy their system of control and their system of false power that they have built up.
[01:28:33.651 --> 01:28:38.995]  It's all a distraction, ultimately, to get you not to study how natural law works.
[01:28:39.575 --> 01:28:51.982]   If you understand natural law and if you incorporate it into your being and into your life, You are going to get protection from creation under all of that because you're going to be acting rightly.
[01:28:52.262 --> 01:28:58.564]  When you truly think and act morally, the universe is going to come to your aid in general.
[01:28:58.904 --> 01:29:04.226]  You know, the forces of creation will support and assist your endeavors when you do that.
[01:29:04.807 --> 01:29:07.007]  Right action creates right results.
[01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:10.769]  Wrong action creates disorder, disharmony, and chaos.
[01:29:11.389 --> 01:29:17.137]  This is why it's so important to be correct about what is moral behavior, what is not moral behavior.
[01:29:17.458 --> 01:29:19.741]  The PSYOPs are there as distractions to that.
[01:29:20.001 --> 01:29:21.463]  We have to stop falling for them.
[01:29:21.703 --> 01:29:26.390]  We have to stop letting these PSYOPs redirect our energy into less important matters.
[01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:29.411]  If we understand morality, that's the linchpin.
[01:29:29.451 --> 01:29:31.031]  That's the master key to all of it.
[01:29:31.411 --> 01:29:40.194]  The psyops are there to keep us in a fearful mindset or keep us in a naive mindset or keep us in a mindset where somebody else has this.
[01:29:40.214 --> 01:29:42.934]  We don't really need to get involved and take real world action.
[01:29:43.134 --> 01:29:44.955]  You know, that's what the psyops are there for.
[01:29:45.335 --> 01:29:55.698]  And I think by exposing them, we're going to get more people to become more street wise about why they're out there, how they really operate, who's conducting them, and most importantly, why.
[01:29:56.857 --> 01:30:02.559]  Well, there's no doubt that the Founding Fathers understood natural law, and they talked about it, and it created the greatest experiment ever.
[01:30:02.599 --> 01:30:08.962]  We've had a lot of problems, but that idea created wealth and security and freedom unlike anything else, and that's why we need to rediscover it.
[01:30:09.262 --> 01:30:11.643]  It's why your work is so incredibly important.
[01:30:11.683 --> 01:30:21.687]  People, again, if you go to your website, WhatOnEarthIsHappening.com, WhatOnEarthIsHappening.com, with Mark Passio, find your free films and all your great work out there.
[01:30:21.707 --> 01:30:24.228]   And listen, Two years went by like 10 seconds.
[01:30:24.548 --> 01:30:25.288]  I want to get you on.
[01:30:26.108 --> 01:30:27.329]  Next two weeks, let's get you back on.
[01:30:27.629 --> 01:30:29.070]  Let's get you to Austin and studio.
[01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:30.730]  We really, really appreciate you.
[01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:32.011]  Mark Passio, talk to you soon.
[01:30:33.192 --> 01:30:33.832]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:30:33.872 --> 01:30:34.492]  Thanks so much.
[01:30:34.532 --> 01:30:35.192]  I appreciate it.
[01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:35.913]  Amazing.
[01:30:36.153 --> 01:30:38.274]  All right, folks, we're going to go to break.
[01:30:39.161 --> 01:30:42.583]  We're going to premiere the Gregory's report, and then Steve Quayle's coming on.
[01:30:42.944 --> 01:30:48.007]  First guy I heard talk about animal-human hybrids and Kim trailing, before it was even ever called Kim trailing.
[01:30:48.387 --> 01:30:55.892]  The guy that predicted the world government and the power outages and the new world order and the cyber attacks and the nanotech and just all of it.
[01:30:56.533 --> 01:30:59.295]  He is coming up to talk about the current giant events.
[01:30:59.355 --> 01:31:03.297]  And now the White House is walking back their Armageddon-Zelensky nuclear war comments.
[01:31:03.578 --> 01:31:06.580]  We've got that clip that just came in coming up on the other side.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.261]  But you don't hear guests like this.
[01:31:08.701 --> 01:31:09.862]  Reaching millions anywhere else.
[01:31:09.942 --> 01:31:12.144]  Thank you listeners for keeping the show on the air.
[01:31:12.344 --> 01:31:13.806]  Don't thank me, I'm thanking you.
[01:31:14.006 --> 01:31:20.006]   but then keep investing in the broadcast by spreading the word, praying for us, and buying the products.
[01:31:20.006 --> 01:31:34.006]  [Music]
[01:31:34.006 --> 01:31:36.006]  Look around you.
[01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:40.172]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[01:31:40.812 --> 01:31:44.013]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[01:31:44.714 --> 01:31:53.497]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I can steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[01:31:54.058 --> 01:31:59.060]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:03.322]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[01:32:04.162 --> 01:32:06.823]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[01:32:07.263 --> 01:32:13.225]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[01:32:13.546 --> 01:32:14.386]  It's unsustainable.

[01:32:33.953 --> 01:32:39.953]  [Music]
[01:32:39.953 --> 01:32:46.953]   While millions may be waking up to the depopulation agenda, it still continues unhindered.
[01:32:47.042 --> 01:32:55.050]  The COVID vaccines have been thoroughly exposed as being deadly, and yet we are still injecting our children with them.
[01:32:55.730 --> 01:33:02.137]  The National Guard deceptively gives service members the deadly COVID vaccine instead of the flu shot.
[01:33:02.877 --> 01:33:15.167]  Russia is forcing all citizens conscripted to fight in Ukraine, now estimated to be 300,000 people, to get vaccinated for COVID or go to jail for 10 years.
[01:33:15.868 --> 01:33:27.937]  And dairy farmers in New Zealand are being forced to vaccinate their cattle with an mRNA vaccine, which is reportedly resulting in the instant death of 15% of the herd.
[01:33:28.438 --> 01:33:41.132]   And the cattle that do survive It is now clear to all that the LGBT movement is part of this depopulation program.
[01:33:41.572 --> 01:33:50.082]  Homosexual sex wasn't enough for this death cult, so they incentivized castrating children under the guise of transgenderism.
[01:33:51.063 --> 01:33:58.390]  Eugenics program Planned Parenthood is now marketing puberty blockers and chemical castration for children.
[01:33:59.051 --> 01:34:11.782]  Planned Parenthood is also launching a new mobile abortion clinic in an attempt to maintain depopulation levels at the borders of states which have made it illegal to kill babies in the womb.
[01:34:13.003 --> 01:34:29.711]  And with the war in Ukraine needlessly escalating, with no peace talks being considered at all, it is evident that the Judas Goats and their bureaucrat minions think they can kill us all and evade justice for their crimes against humanity.
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:59.715]  It appears that the United States has sabotaged Russia's Nord Stream 2 fuel pipeline, an act of war reminiscent of the Berlin-Baghdad railway conflict that helped ignite World War I. Early this week, Russia's infamous Doomsday Submarine, capable of creating a radioactive tsunami, reportedly disappeared from its base and was spotted days later while operating on the Arctic surface.
[01:35:01.161 --> 01:35:17.476]  Photographs in the city of Belgorod appear to show the deployment of the Peresvet mobile laser system, which renders an area invisible to enemy surveillance by blinding surrounding satellites, allowing Russia to secretly mobilize and attack.
[01:35:18.667 --> 01:35:23.250]  Retired Brigadier General Kimmitt says nukes are on the table.
[01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:27.092]  Look, I think it's fairly simple to lay down the options.
[01:35:27.152 --> 01:35:39.299]  It could be the soft side of it, which is doubling down on sanctions, doubling down on export controls, ranging all the way to a nuclear response of our own and everything in between.
[01:35:39.319 --> 01:35:39.379]  Wow.
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:47.364]  Zelensky says that NATO must preemptively launch nuclear weapons against Russia as a warning.
[01:35:48.184 --> 01:35:52.709]  And unhinged Hollywood activist Sean Penn agrees with him.
[01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:57.513]  Even countries that have nuclear weapons can remain intimidated to use them.
[01:35:57.693 --> 01:35:59.975]  And we're seeing that now with our own country.
[01:36:00.376 --> 01:36:02.618]  And I fear what that legacy is going to be.
[01:36:02.898 --> 01:36:04.840]  No one wants to see a nuclear conflict.
[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:06.461]  I don't want to see one.
[01:36:06.481 --> 01:36:13.588]  At the same time, if only one bully is going to be able to use those weapons as a threat, we've got to rethink what we're doing.
[01:36:14.048 --> 01:36:26.153]  The lunatics in charge are buying up underground bunkers and anti-radiation drugs in hopes they will survive the mass culling agenda that continues on, unhindered.
[01:36:26.854 --> 01:36:29.155]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:36:33.137 --> 01:36:39.179]  Well, the man joining us predicted all of this at a level even more accurate than myself.
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:42.761]  For people like David Icke, he's Steve Quayle.
[01:36:43.914 --> 01:36:44.975]  And he's with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:36:45.015 --> 01:36:48.857]  We've got to do a commercial-free two-hour emergency show with him very, very soon.
[01:36:49.798 --> 01:36:51.999]  We are inside the New World Order now.
[01:36:52.079 --> 01:36:55.762]  I want to play the White House Press Secretary just 30 minutes ago.
[01:36:55.782 --> 01:36:56.442]  This just broke.
[01:36:57.223 --> 01:37:02.946]  Walking back, Biden's saying we're about to have Armageddon yesterday, and Zelensky's saying we need to preemptively nuke Russia.
[01:37:04.207 --> 01:37:05.468]  I mean, these people are out.
[01:37:05.528 --> 01:37:06.689]  This has never before happened.
[01:37:07.623 --> 01:37:08.024]  In U.S.
[01:37:08.084 --> 01:37:08.685]  or world history.
[01:37:09.145 --> 01:37:12.310]  This is way more dangerous than the Cuban Missile Crisis, in my view.
[01:37:12.330 --> 01:37:17.318]  We'll get Steve Quayle, bestselling author, researcher, true patriot, trailblazer, stevequayle.com.
[01:37:19.902 --> 01:37:21.183]  Here he is, the Press Secretary.
[01:37:22.125 --> 01:37:28.789]  If the President planned to use the word Armageddon, why did he choose that particular reference to Revelation 16-16?
[01:37:28.949 --> 01:37:33.691]  Okay, so Russia's talk of using nuclear weapons is irresponsible.
[01:37:34.512 --> 01:37:38.874]  And there's no way to use them without unintended consequences.
[01:37:39.414 --> 01:37:40.215]  It cannot happen.
[01:37:41.015 --> 01:37:44.037]  We won't be intimidated by Putin's rhetoric.
[01:37:44.378 --> 01:37:49.401]  We have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture, nor do we have indications.
[01:37:49.842 --> 01:37:56.386]  They are preparing to use them, but Putin can de-escalate this at any time, and there is no reason to escalate.
[01:37:56.406 --> 01:37:58.688]  Putin just called for the peace deal.
[01:37:58.728 --> 01:37:59.909]  I'm not lionizing Putin.
[01:38:00.349 --> 01:38:01.010]  Steve Quayle?
[01:38:01.781 --> 01:38:07.686]  The original founder of the Patriot Movement, the guy that exposed the entire New Order agenda 30 plus years ago.
[01:38:07.746 --> 01:38:08.446]  Steve, you're here.
[01:38:08.807 --> 01:38:09.847]  Thank you for joining us, my friend.
[01:38:09.867 --> 01:38:10.748]  It's such dire times.
[01:38:11.028 --> 01:38:12.289]  You've been warning of this for so long.
[01:38:12.349 --> 01:38:12.830]  Now it's here.
[01:38:13.150 --> 01:38:14.751]  How would you describe the state of the world today?
[01:38:14.771 --> 01:38:22.757]  All right, we've got a problem with Steve's audio.
[01:38:23.158 --> 01:38:24.819]  Steve, I don't know if it's on your end or on our end.
[01:38:24.959 --> 01:38:25.179]  Okay.
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:26.380]  Can you hear me now?
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:26.801]  Yes, sir.
[01:38:26.821 --> 01:38:27.081]  Go ahead.
[01:38:27.101 --> 01:38:27.241]  Yeah.
[01:38:27.816 --> 01:38:28.437]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:38:28.917 --> 01:38:31.940]  We are at and undergoing nuclear war right now.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.742]  The preparatory phases of it are initiated.
[01:38:34.802 --> 01:38:35.783]  Now, I want to make it clear.
[01:38:36.323 --> 01:38:37.805]  When you tell the truth, I tell the truth.
[01:38:37.885 --> 01:38:38.926]  It's not propaganda.
[01:38:38.946 --> 01:38:47.913]  The United States initiated the talk of nuking Russia, and it was never brought up from the Russian mouthpieces until they were responding to us.
[01:38:48.554 --> 01:39:01.160]   Right now, even in the last 24 hours, Alex, there was an intercontinental ballistic missile intercepted over basically the Yukon territory and I have guys that have calculated the trajectory.
[01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:02.540]  It's beyond my math skills.
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:05.521]  And someone was sending an ICBM.
[01:39:05.561 --> 01:39:06.561]  It was not Russia.
[01:39:07.081 --> 01:39:10.662]  So the point being is that we have missiles being intercepted.
[01:39:10.802 --> 01:39:14.423]  By the way, that piece you just put together is outstanding.
[01:39:14.703 --> 01:39:19.444]  We've got lasers being used to blind our eyes in the skies.
[01:39:20.542 --> 01:39:26.187]  We have watched the, if you will, the rhetoric ratchet up now, and there's no pulling it back.
[01:39:26.267 --> 01:39:27.528]  There is no pulling it back.
[01:39:27.548 --> 01:39:28.809]  And again, your audio was cut out.
[01:39:28.849 --> 01:39:29.289]  Start over.
[01:39:29.309 --> 01:39:30.890]  We're in the preparatory phases of nuclear war.
[01:39:30.930 --> 01:39:31.771]  They even admit that.
[01:39:32.452 --> 01:39:40.098]  And at the same time, I've been worried about a nuclear false flag by some rogue group or some specter-type group, and you're saying that may have happened today.
[01:39:41.218 --> 01:39:43.500]  That may have happened, actually, in the last 24 hours.
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:44.721]  Now, can you hear me okay now?
[01:39:44.881 --> 01:39:45.222]  I can hear you.
[01:39:45.242 --> 01:39:45.582]  Start over.
[01:39:46.587 --> 01:39:48.348]  Okay, yep, yep.
[01:39:48.568 --> 01:40:00.595]  The launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile from the Far East has taken place and it was intercepted over the area in Silver City, Yukon.
[01:40:01.096 --> 01:40:06.119]  Now what most people don't understand is that we're no longer playing games.
[01:40:06.219 --> 01:40:08.080]  We bombed the Nord Stream Pipeline.
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:18.146]   You saw Victoria Nuland, you saw the President make the statements, we saw the Commendation from one of the Polish ministers.
[01:40:18.547 --> 01:40:22.410]  And ladies and gentlemen, we're watching acts of war taking place.
[01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:30.736]  And I believe that we have seen right now, Alex, the first shots of World War III, nuclear World War III being fired.
[01:40:30.756 --> 01:40:32.597]  And by the way, the Russians notified the U.S.
[01:40:32.617 --> 01:40:45.364]   government, I'm told this, that D.C., Washington, D.C., New York, and Denver, Denver's a home of the continuity of government, a facilitating center in case of Washington DC disappearing,
[01:40:45.364 --> 01:40:51.444]   they've already told, they the Russians have told the United States what they're going
[01:40:51.444 --> 01:40:56.624]   to do and the United States is basically saying, well they're warning the people they
[01:40:56.624 --> 01:41:01.083]   better be ready to change clothes in a nuclear attack in the subway in New York.
[01:41:01.427 --> 01:41:15.106]   The United States has no civil defense, no food, no sanitation, no even radiation sensors, and yet any country that can shield its population and its industry as well as Russia
[01:41:15.106 --> 01:41:15.997]  has.
[01:41:15.997 --> 01:41:21.837]   Basically Russia's in the upper hand position and it's fascinating because now what we're
[01:41:21.837 --> 01:41:28.318]   watching is the statements of ordering $290 million worth of anti-radiation pills.
[01:41:28.318 --> 01:41:30.478]  All this stuff is too little, too late.
[01:41:30.611 --> 01:41:38.877]  We have sat, as the American people, and watched the theft of liberty, the theft of freedom, and now the theft of our lives.
[01:41:39.017 --> 01:41:44.141]  And there's a disconnect, Alex, because people are in a reality avoidance mentality.
[01:41:44.541 --> 01:41:50.906]  But meanwhile, the false flag, you are absolutely correct, the false flag will take place in Ukraine.
[01:41:50.966 --> 01:41:53.687]   It will be an atomic Stay there.
[01:41:53.527 --> 01:41:55.206]  And the Russians will be blamed.
[01:41:55.206 --> 01:42:02.706]   So the Russians are on basic notification to everybody, look, we know this is coming.
[01:42:02.706 --> 01:42:08.126]   But we're, and there's no statements coming out of Russia that it's going to be a tactical
[01:42:08.126 --> 01:42:09.966]  response.
[01:42:09.966 --> 01:42:11.926]  They're talking strategic response.
[01:42:11.926 --> 01:42:17.167]   They're stating that NATO nations and the United States, and they named the targets,
[01:42:17.167 --> 01:42:18.167]  are what are going to exist.
[01:42:18.167 --> 01:42:19.167]  Stay there.
[01:42:19.167 --> 01:42:20.725]  Russia is getting ready for full nuclear war.
[01:42:20.725 --> 01:42:22.405]  Couldn't be a more important broadcast.
[01:42:22.437 --> 01:42:23.277]  Stay with us, Steve Quayle.
[01:42:24.098 --> 01:42:29.780]  There is a extreme surrealness to where we are.
[01:42:30.601 --> 01:42:33.622]  The President of the United States talking about Armageddon and the end of the world.
[01:42:36.283 --> 01:42:43.367]  The dictator now of Ukraine, he is a dictator, he was elected, he's having a dictatorship, calling for a preemptive nuclear strike on Russia.
[01:42:44.647 --> 01:42:49.870]  Everybody from Sean Penn to you name it calling for nuclear war and liberals saying, we love nuclear war, it's liberal!
[01:42:51.058 --> 01:42:54.085]  Steve Quill, top analyst on this.
[01:42:54.686 --> 01:42:55.969]  Please continue.
[01:42:56.009 --> 01:42:59.497]  We went to break you talking about a false flag in Ukraine, a nuclear false flag.
[01:43:00.677 --> 01:43:05.200]  Well, right, and what you're calling, obviously, the surrealness of the moment.
[01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:16.748]  We are talking about the absolute worst case scenario, the nightmare that's unfolding, and there's a reality disengagement in the mainstream press.
[01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:24.774]  Alex, everything, and I want to say this, everything that you've warned about, everything you've made your videos about, ladies and gentlemen, Alex is the tip of the spear.
[01:43:25.214 --> 01:43:35.248]   And I'm encouraging you, if you have any sense Of saving the Republic, or at least the remnant of the Republic, please get behind him.
[01:43:35.288 --> 01:43:49.651]  Because ladies and gentlemen, we are at a moment in time, unlike any other, and our Defense Department is making war on the American population, the American servicemen, and forgetting we've got real enemies out there.
[01:43:50.012 --> 01:44:01.097]   And the cavalier, that's the best word I know, attitude of the Biden administration, the The military and the whole, if you will, war within the U.S.
[01:44:01.137 --> 01:44:05.840]  military, the destruction of our advanced technology, defunding them.
[01:44:06.121 --> 01:44:10.744]  And I got to tell you, Alex, red high heel shoes won't stop a hypersonic missile.
[01:44:11.145 --> 01:44:13.427]  Russia has demonstrated their prowess.
[01:44:13.447 --> 01:44:14.468]  Now, look, I want to say something.
[01:44:14.508 --> 01:44:15.869]  The truth is the truth.
[01:44:16.369 --> 01:44:22.054]  And we have in the United States broken every treaty, every agreement we ever made with Russia.
[01:44:22.494 --> 01:44:22.914]  They have.
[01:44:22.974 --> 01:44:23.695]  And I'm saying this.
[01:44:24.175 --> 01:44:28.577]  I'm fighting, you're fighting, to try and influence whoever's out there listening.
[01:44:28.897 --> 01:44:30.818]  You don't want nuclear war.
[01:44:31.118 --> 01:44:33.119]  You don't want the destruction.
[01:44:33.199 --> 01:44:51.367]  Now, I'm talking to the average American, but the globalists, the Illuminists, they are absolutely wetting themselves for joy over the fact that they're going to get rid of, you know, a billion people, not just from initial nuclear radiation effects, but from the starvation, the lack of communication.
[01:44:52.348 --> 01:44:59.194]  I mean, I know there's estimates of a limited nuclear war in Europe killing 900 and something million, but don't most estimates show it'll escalate quickly?
[01:44:59.214 --> 01:45:00.315]  We're talking 5 billion dead?
[01:45:01.522 --> 01:45:02.382]  Yep, pretty much.
[01:45:02.422 --> 01:45:03.082]  And here's the thing.
[01:45:03.562 --> 01:45:11.364]  When you're calculating deaths by nuclear weapons, you know, there's not 100% fission or fusion in the case of a hydrogen bomb.
[01:45:11.724 --> 01:45:17.185]  But what we're talking about is the initial death due to the blast, due to the overpressure, due to the heat.
[01:45:17.425 --> 01:45:21.866]  But we're talking billions, and I'm sorry, billions that are going to die.
[01:45:22.226 --> 01:45:23.566]  And that's biblical.
[01:45:23.966 --> 01:45:26.347]  We are in the realm of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
[01:45:26.747 --> 01:45:29.189]  And, you know, I think people better understand this.
[01:45:29.529 --> 01:45:36.913]  We've watched the weather being modified, weaponized against specifically Florida and previously last year, Texas.
[01:45:37.293 --> 01:45:43.177]  And now we've got the situation where, again, we cannot fight a two-front war.
[01:45:43.637 --> 01:45:44.898]  We cannot fight China.
[01:45:44.938 --> 01:45:46.099]  We can't even fight Russia.
[01:45:46.499 --> 01:45:53.423]  And Trump, the one thing I'll say to his credit is simply that he had a working relationship with Putin.
[01:45:53.903 --> 01:45:57.706]  And recognize Putin as a very brilliant man.
[01:45:58.107 --> 01:46:06.854]  The images you're putting on the screen right now, ladies and gentlemen, these are the people that are running the government, especially the image right now of the black leather.
[01:46:07.074 --> 01:46:13.459]  That gentleman, I guess that's a wrong, that pronoun person is in charge of the Department of Energy.
[01:46:13.559 --> 01:46:15.460]  Guess what the Department of Energy runs?
[01:46:15.801 --> 01:46:21.185]  The nuclear, how should I say, not only production of weapons, but also the distribution of weapons.
[01:46:21.265 --> 01:46:22.146]  Very powerful.
[01:46:22.566 --> 01:46:26.769]  And then you've got the head of the monkeypox operation and satanic regalia saying he's a satanist.
[01:46:27.230 --> 01:46:32.093]  You've got the army officer that got caught trying to sell cigarettes to China on Delta Force, who's a woman.
[01:46:32.173 --> 01:46:33.094]  I mean, this is a cult.
[01:46:34.155 --> 01:46:37.397]  This is a cult, and it's a Luciferian cult.
[01:46:37.978 --> 01:46:54.228]   And I think what people lose track of, Alex, they, the Luciferian cults, as represented by the W.E.Fers, okay, and obviously Yuval Harari and Schwab and the whole ilk, They're on record as saying they own 50% of the governments of the world.
[01:46:54.268 --> 01:46:56.009]  They have their people.
[01:46:56.029 --> 01:46:56.809]  50% of every government.
[01:46:56.829 --> 01:46:59.630]  That's why you're seeing the breakdown of Western Europe.
[01:46:59.670 --> 01:47:14.125]   That's why you're seeing the whole petroleum industry destroyed because they do not want Those, and I'll just call it the entities that you're seeing, they do not want humanities to survive.
[01:47:14.145 --> 01:47:15.025]  They're transhumanists.
[01:47:15.065 --> 01:47:17.786]  You've done a beautiful job on talking about that.
[01:47:18.126 --> 01:47:18.807]  I've written about it.
[01:47:18.827 --> 01:47:23.969]  But ladies and gentlemen, the extinction of 250 million Americans.
[01:47:24.349 --> 01:47:25.409]  Alex has carried the story.
[01:47:25.569 --> 01:47:26.730]  I've talked about the story.
[01:47:27.150 --> 01:47:36.515]   That according to the Deagle Report, a Rockefeller Foundation, if you will, mouthpiece, 250 million Americans have to die in the next three years.
[01:47:36.856 --> 01:47:43.661]  So Alex, there is no, how should I say this, there is no having to hype the danger we're in.
[01:47:43.821 --> 01:47:48.724]  And I can tell you, the United States has no, how should I say, viable alternative.
[01:47:48.745 --> 01:47:50.466]  We have no anti-missile defense system.
[01:47:51.066 --> 01:48:15.494]   We've got so many traitors in our military within, without, and we watched the vaksasination, that's my word, of the I would say this, those who would not comply to die, basically, now we have a weakened military, we have the Obama promise that, in essence, watch what he's going to do to the United States.
[01:48:15.894 --> 01:48:19.617]  The United States is the greatest nation in the world, and we intend to change all that.
[01:48:19.657 --> 01:48:20.878]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's changed.
[01:48:21.418 --> 01:48:28.185]  Most people live in an illusory world of thinking America's the top dog on the block, and it no longer is.
[01:48:28.606 --> 01:48:32.029]  And there is no protection, civil defense-wise.
[01:48:32.389 --> 01:48:34.412]  Everything is on a personal level.
[01:48:34.512 --> 01:48:40.880]   And Eric, I'm sorry, you were just showing The idea that we're cannon fodder, I can't make it any more urgent than it is.
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:49.440]   it. They're out of here. So the idea that we're cannon fodder, I can't make it any more urgent
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:56.800]   than it is. Again, if the American people knew that a belligerent nation launched an intercontinental
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:01.119]  ballistic missile with a 50 kiloton nuclear warhead.
[01:49:01.298 --> 01:49:02.379]  These are real numbers.
[01:49:02.939 --> 01:49:06.241]  Would you think that maybe somebody would say, boy, it's later than we think?
[01:49:06.261 --> 01:49:08.522]  And by the way, I mean, I know you always have incredible sources.
[01:49:08.542 --> 01:49:10.263]  Is that in the news or is that your intel sources?
[01:49:10.303 --> 01:49:12.004]  Because it's happened seven or eight times.
[01:49:12.064 --> 01:49:19.067]  I remember when from submarines and from overseas, China, Russia and others, we've done it to them, fired dummy warheads.
[01:49:19.087 --> 01:49:21.889]  You know, they fire an ICBM to just show we can hit you.
[01:49:22.549 --> 01:49:24.731]  But then have it just crash into the ground without a payload.
[01:49:24.791 --> 01:49:25.671]  Is that what you're saying happened?
[01:49:26.752 --> 01:49:30.275]  I'm saying that there was a lie based on my back sources.
[01:49:30.295 --> 01:49:40.442]  And by the way, the story coming out of the Yukon was they watched two metal objects crash in the air, so something was intercepted.
[01:49:40.462 --> 01:49:48.988]   An ICBM, an intercontinental ballistic missile, has to use a higher flight path And then a hypersonic missile.
[01:49:49.028 --> 01:49:53.470]  So we know it wasn't Russia, because Russia has a Kinzhal hypersonic missile.
[01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:55.690]  So who else has nuclear capability?
[01:49:55.710 --> 01:49:59.652]  Well, it pretty well leaves China, and it pretty well leaves North Korea.
[01:50:00.672 --> 01:50:12.457]  The dismissal of the events that have been taking place on the North Korean border, obviously the scrambling of quite a few, what, 24 jets of the North Koreans?
[01:50:12.477 --> 01:50:12.817]  Well, sure.
[01:50:12.857 --> 01:50:16.999]  I mean, Japan just last week told everybody, shelter at home, because of a missile that flew right over the island.
[01:50:17.970 --> 01:50:31.642]  Correct, and I'm told by my sources, and again ladies and gentlemen, you've got to get away, and Alex, most people have got to get away from the fact that if it isn't on Fox, if it isn't on MSNBC, if it isn't on the major networks, it can't be true.
[01:50:32.102 --> 01:50:36.686]  Everything we've warned about, that we've been called, all the names we've been called, has come to pass.
[01:50:36.746 --> 01:50:49.156]   And now nuclear war, and everybody was saying, oh there will never be a nuclear war, and the President says, Hey, there's gonna be a nuclear war, and he's the one that is facilitating, and I would say this, initiating and provoking.
[01:50:49.176 --> 01:50:53.278]  The guy in control of the nuclear launch code starting the war tells you Armageddon is here.
[01:50:53.298 --> 01:50:54.179]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:57.351]  We are sleepwalking into Armageddon.
[01:50:57.772 --> 01:50:59.413]  The icon exposing the New World Order.
[01:50:59.813 --> 01:51:01.914]  The guy that said all the information for anybody else.
[01:51:01.954 --> 01:51:04.456]  Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com is our guest.
[01:51:04.476 --> 01:51:07.557]  Now, I've been trying for two weeks to get Steve on.
[01:51:08.578 --> 01:51:12.661]  So, the fact that we're in the middle of this escalated crisis, it's not like he just came on today because this is happening.
[01:51:13.281 --> 01:51:15.562]  He's been worrying about this for a long time, but this is when he can come on.
[01:51:16.003 --> 01:51:17.403]  Perfect timing, the way the Lord works.
[01:51:18.504 --> 01:51:22.888]  But I also wanted to get him on because he's an expert on preparation and getting ready.
[01:51:23.348 --> 01:51:27.612]  And nobody can break down how important satellite phones and things like that are than Steve.
[01:51:28.252 --> 01:51:35.398]  And Steve's a guy, a few years ago, got us in touch with one of the biggest sat phone sales groups out there and their patrons that supply the Border Patrol, you name it.
[01:51:35.418 --> 01:51:39.822]  He was going to talk about that some today and how people should get storable food and all the rest of it, what's going on in the world.
[01:51:40.242 --> 01:51:42.504]  You don't need us to even tell you that with the things that are happening.
[01:51:43.314 --> 01:51:46.795]  Well, Steve, I want to get back in to Russia, Ukraine, how we de-escalate this.
[01:51:46.815 --> 01:51:48.876]  What do you think the globals are planning next?
[01:51:48.896 --> 01:51:55.577]  Klaus Schwab saying, you know, imminent cyber attacks, but then he says he wants to shut down industrial society, the poison shots, all of it with you.
[01:51:55.597 --> 01:51:56.938]  But let's spend some time on this.
[01:51:57.698 --> 01:52:01.959]  You got us the amazing sponsor a few years ago that have been great.
[01:52:02.139 --> 01:52:07.421]  The problem was everybody sold out of high quality, but at the same time affordable sat phones.
[01:52:07.461 --> 01:52:08.881]  They finally got them back in.
[01:52:09.921 --> 01:52:11.322]  The shipment's arriving next week.
[01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:14.311]  They're free phones when people sign up for the service.
[01:52:14.631 --> 01:52:17.193]  So you're just simply signing up to make sure that when it comes in you get it.
[01:52:17.993 --> 01:52:24.297]  And so they also have this amazing bivy stick dongle that turns any phone into a sat phone.
[01:52:24.777 --> 01:52:25.238]  I've got it.
[01:52:25.298 --> 01:52:26.038]  My family's got it.
[01:52:26.058 --> 01:52:26.878]  It's something everybody needs.
[01:52:27.239 --> 01:52:34.883]  Spend a few minutes telling folks about InfoWarsPhone.com that simply takes them to this great group and organization that has these products right now.
[01:52:35.263 --> 01:52:37.204]  So many of which nobody else has got.
[01:52:37.565 --> 01:52:38.765]  InfoWarsPhone.com.
[01:52:38.785 --> 01:52:39.526]  Steve, tell us about that.
[01:52:40.728 --> 01:52:51.072]  Well, first of all, anybody who's watched what happened in Florida absolutely saw people without power, people without communication, and the word when you lose communication is you panic.
[01:52:51.472 --> 01:53:07.502]   The nice thing about satellite phone stores is the owners have dedicated themselves to making sure Everyone can stay in touch with their loved ones if they understand how fragile the electrical grid is and also the cell phone communication grid.
[01:53:07.562 --> 01:53:12.345]  I'm told that there are hundreds of thousands of people without cell phones in Florida.
[01:53:12.466 --> 01:53:21.352]  And what was neat about Satellite Phone Store, Alex, they sent out vans and were finding people that had to communicate to let their loved ones know that they're alive.
[01:53:21.632 --> 01:53:25.335]  Communication in a survival situation is paramount.
[01:53:25.835 --> 01:53:30.856]  Not just to be keeping in contact with your loved ones, but for information services.
[01:53:30.896 --> 01:53:39.197]  So the BivyStick, which I'm holding in my hand right now, actually we'll leave it on the screen like you did, I mean you can send out 1,000 character messages.
[01:53:39.558 --> 01:53:42.898]  The BivyStick obviously is satellite to satellite.
[01:53:43.258 --> 01:53:49.939]  You use your cell phone in airplane mode, but this is probably one of the neatest things there is.
[01:53:50.460 --> 01:53:52.520]  And these are free, just with a year contract.
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:54.403]  Gentlemen, this is... Let's explain.
[01:53:54.463 --> 01:53:56.689]  Even though your cell phone doesn't have service, this does.
[01:53:57.230 --> 01:54:00.999]  So when your cell phone doesn't have service, it plugs into this, and now you can send text messages.
[01:54:01.943 --> 01:54:03.284]  Correct, text messages.
[01:54:03.524 --> 01:54:10.830]  The difference between the bivy stick and satellite phone, actually satellite phone is a voice communication but you're limited to the amount of text you can send.
[01:54:11.130 --> 01:54:24.021]  With a bivy stick you can give more important data and there are people around the world now Alex that can give us a heads up on what's going on in the world through bivy stick messaging and that's one of the things that's so important.
[01:54:24.061 --> 01:54:35.771]   Communication is the key to your mind being kept in a They have it in stock.
[01:54:35.791 --> 01:54:38.353]  They have a huge shipment coming in this next week.
[01:54:38.693 --> 01:54:39.594]  This is already Friday.
[01:54:40.034 --> 01:54:40.875]  They'll start shipping.
[01:54:40.935 --> 01:54:41.736]  It's a free phone.
[01:54:41.776 --> 01:54:42.717]  You sign up for the service.
[01:54:43.056 --> 01:54:46.777]   So just get signed up and as soon as the phone's there, as soon as you get delivered, as soon as you activate it,
[01:54:46.777 --> 01:54:48.036]  you just pay for the service.
[01:54:48.036 --> 01:54:53.216]   This is a great deal, one of the best deals out there and they're Patriots, Infowarsphone.com.
[01:54:53.216 --> 01:54:58.256]   Pre-order the free iSAT2 satellite phone, get a free satellite phone,

[01:55:11.657 --> 01:55:13.657]  as the calls up the satellite.
[01:55:13.389 --> 01:55:15.391]  Costs money, works anywhere that you're out in the open.
[01:55:15.411 --> 01:55:17.393]  They have antennas, so you can be inside as well.
[01:55:17.793 --> 01:55:24.739]  They have in stock the BivyStik and a free BivyStik device with unlimited data, unlimited data, for only $55 a month.
[01:55:24.759 --> 01:55:26.120]  The BivyStik is a pocket-sized device.
[01:55:26.921 --> 01:55:36.228]  It allows you to, in any regular smartphone, as a satellite communications device, send unlimited text data, GPS usage, and weather reports from anywhere.
[01:55:36.528 --> 01:55:38.610]  Go to InfoWarsPhone.com or 941-955-1020.
[01:55:38.630 --> 01:55:38.690]  941-955-1020.
[01:55:38.710 --> 01:55:39.651]  That's InfoWarsPhone.com or 941-955-1020.
[01:55:39.691 --> 01:55:40.832]  This is essential.
[01:55:41.052 --> 01:55:47.422]  941-955-1020. That's infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1020.
[01:55:47.422 --> 01:55:48.891]  This is essential. Everybody needs this.
[01:55:48.891 --> 01:55:57.212]   And again, Alex, I think it's critical that people understand and really focus on this,
[01:55:57.212 --> 01:56:02.571]   is that ladies and gentlemen, we're in no man's land when we're talking about nuclear war.
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:04.241]  And we're not talking about in the future.
[01:56:04.261 --> 01:56:05.883]  We're not talking about Cold War policy.
[01:56:06.143 --> 01:56:09.906]  We're not talking about a strategic... We're not talking about Kim Jong-un having five of them.
[01:56:09.926 --> 01:56:11.007]  I mean, the Russians with 10,000 of them.
[01:56:12.378 --> 01:56:13.780]  You got it, and here's the deal.
[01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:49.174]   When you're looking at the weapons development, a Poseidon nuclear torpedo, by the way Alex, our Defense Department, until Russia showed them at a weapons fair, didn't believe that there was such a thing as an autonomous Self-directed by AI intelligent torpedo weapon that was a hundred megatons and they're already saying look we can generate a 1600 foot radioactive tsunami which is true and just because the powers that be are so ignorantly blind they will not understand hypersonic
[01:56:49.754 --> 01:57:02.260]  The reason hypersonic is so well-developed is that the Russians and the Indians, and believe it or not, the North Koreans and others have been working on them, and in the meantime, the majority of the U.S.
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:06.462]  attempt to even achieve hypersonic missiles has gone by the wayside.
[01:57:06.862 --> 01:57:09.444]  And so this isn't, this is not a game.
[01:57:09.524 --> 01:57:27.704]   See, this is what makes me the most Talked okay is that people somehow think that this stuff all this is just happening and if it was really beyond the mainstream news the mainstream news some of the reporters will be sitting with their microphones in New York City when all of a sudden the screen goes blank
[01:57:28.204 --> 01:57:43.108]  And, well, ladies and gentlemen, it's so critical that we stand behind InfoWars, that we support financially, because, in essence, the entire truth movement is what the enemy is, because there is no truth in them.
[01:57:43.428 --> 01:57:44.948]  They live in a world of lies.
[01:57:44.988 --> 01:57:46.549]  They live in a kingdom of lies.
[01:57:46.569 --> 01:57:54.811]  And they know if we take over the infrastructure of the planet, the globalists are out, so they want nuclear wars, famines, bioweapons to wipe us out, and they'll reorganize the wreckage.
[01:57:55.945 --> 01:57:59.008]  Right, and I want to make a statement too that we need to understand.
[01:57:59.289 --> 01:58:16.987]  Ladies and gentlemen, with all of the residual DNA that's been gathered through the tests and all of the genetic testing banks and all of the Ancestry.com, the Chinese own the world's largest... You said Ancestry.com 10 years ago was selling it to China and it all came out last year.
[01:58:18.055 --> 01:58:18.635]  Yep.
[01:58:18.715 --> 01:58:22.517]  And again, you know, I got a lot of crap that people said, oh, they can't target individuals.
[01:58:22.557 --> 01:58:23.158]  Yes, they can.
[01:58:24.218 --> 01:58:27.440]  Representative Cox, excuse me, just came out.
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:28.100]  Crown.
[01:58:28.941 --> 01:58:29.521]  No, Crow.
[01:58:29.601 --> 01:58:29.941]  I'm sorry.
[01:58:29.961 --> 01:58:30.722]  Three different people.
[01:58:31.062 --> 01:58:39.026]  Representative Crow just came out and said his major concern at the Aspen Institute is biological weapons that are targeted to individuals.
[01:58:39.786 --> 01:59:03.802]   Individually targeted bioweapons so ladies and gentlemen everything that you think is private there is no privacy any longer down to a genetic level so let's say a specific group has been designated a problem group By the integration of their DNA and their individualization of that DNA, anybody can be targeted.
[01:59:03.822 --> 01:59:12.048]  And I believe that, obviously, if it weren't for the prayers of your listeners, my listeners, Alex, they absolutely would have succeeded in taking me out.
[01:59:12.089 --> 01:59:13.109]  I'm not grandstanding.
[01:59:13.490 --> 01:59:27.259]   I'm just telling you that going back, as you know, when I start talking about individual bioweaponized strains of viruses that would be Person-specific, individual-specific, people just laughed.
[01:59:27.659 --> 01:59:33.803]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, you can laugh, but all the imagery right now, all the news, look at Drudge.
[01:59:33.863 --> 01:59:38.325]  I think, unless it's still there, Drudge has an atomic explosion.
[01:59:38.345 --> 01:59:39.526]  They're quoting Biden.
[01:59:39.946 --> 01:59:44.588]  And Alex, we, the United States, are the ones that initiate.
[01:59:44.608 --> 01:59:45.389]  Thank you very much.
[01:59:45.969 --> 01:59:56.373]  We are the ones that initiated the talk of nuking Russia, and then Zelensky now is having to backpedal because he basically said the United States needs to do a first strike on Russia.
[01:59:56.893 --> 02:00:08.197]  Russia's been defined, and by the way, interestingly enough, everybody wants to vilify them, but it is the globalists that want Russia taken out of the way because they simply want Russia's fresh water.
[02:00:08.438 --> 02:00:12.019]  25% of the fresh water in the planet is in Lake Bikal in Russia.
[02:00:12.219 --> 02:00:17.761]   They want their wheat, they want their gold, they want Global control and Russia's nationalists.
[02:00:17.841 --> 02:00:27.484]  I'd say this, when President Putin, and this is a fact, when President Putin put a floor on gold, he put the entire... Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[02:00:27.744 --> 02:00:29.665]  Steve Quill, incredible information.
[02:00:31.506 --> 02:00:40.649]  There's so much huge news unfolding in the world, I've not even talked about, except the first five minutes of the show, I spent like 20 seconds on it.
[02:00:41.621 --> 02:00:47.325]  The show trials, where I'm of the Democrats, where I was already found guilty for questioning Sandy Hook, where they lied about everything I said and did.
[02:00:47.866 --> 02:01:12.740]   The lawyers asked yesterday, and I've actually got the paperwork from the lawyers here, my lawyers, they actually asked for 8.25 billion just on the first charge of reputational loss, they asked for an unlimited amount on emotional distress, and then a false advertising claim that had nothing to do with Sandy Hook, that all our advertising is criminal, and they asked for billions there.
[02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:14.061]  I don't have $2 million in the bank.
[02:01:14.501 --> 02:01:20.225]  So it's a joke at the end of the day, with all this nuclear war information and the rest of it, but it shows how desperate they are.
[02:01:20.265 --> 02:01:22.646]  Plus, Connecticut and Texas are capped at $5 million.
[02:01:23.936 --> 02:01:26.197]  They want that number to scare people.
[02:01:26.217 --> 02:01:27.838]  So people have to say, how are you handling all this?
[02:01:28.598 --> 02:01:30.959]  I'm 10,000% worried about nuclear war.
[02:01:30.999 --> 02:01:34.180]  I'm not even 1% worried about this BS, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:34.801 --> 02:01:38.902]  But I'm still going to cover it because it's so interesting at the start of the next hour after Steve Quill leaves us.
[02:01:38.942 --> 02:01:39.983]  But what do they say in there?
[02:01:40.703 --> 02:01:48.266]  In the Texas trial, the hand of Connecticut, they're like, he tells you the water is poisonous and sells water filters as if it's a manipulation.
[02:01:49.267 --> 02:02:01.233]   It'd be like, If prospectors were going into the Klondikes or something 150 years ago, and they said, hey, you might want to buy a coat before you go there, and I'm selling coats, you know, on the trails for the gold mine.
[02:02:01.393 --> 02:02:03.494]  I mean, you need a coat, you need boots, you need a pickaxe.
[02:02:04.595 --> 02:02:06.536]  The question is, is it a good coat, is it a good pickaxe?
[02:02:06.576 --> 02:02:07.316]  And damn right it is.
[02:02:08.037 --> 02:02:13.100]  As if it's a manipulation, we overtly say the water's full of toxins, you better be filtering your water.
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:17.543]  Here are several brands of top-rated water filtration systems at preparetoday.com.
[02:02:18.348 --> 02:02:20.989]  We openly say the world's getting more unstable.
[02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:24.011]  You need a satellite dongle or a satellite phone.
[02:02:24.091 --> 02:02:24.631]  I've got one.
[02:02:24.671 --> 02:02:26.952]  Yeah, we're selling it to you to keep us on air.
[02:02:27.052 --> 02:02:27.552]  We have them.
[02:02:27.592 --> 02:02:28.253]  We believe in it.
[02:02:29.253 --> 02:02:38.997]  It's like, you know, I hate to be gross here, but if you were being forced to the Navy or something and some right of passage to be with some prostitute that's got gonorrhea, you better wear a condom.
[02:02:39.358 --> 02:02:49.100]   You know, we are literally here just warning people about what's going on and then trying To get you prepared for what we see happening.
[02:02:49.381 --> 02:02:52.543]  I told you two and a half years ago, buy swearable food, food prices are going to double.
[02:02:52.843 --> 02:02:53.424]  Now they have.
[02:02:54.585 --> 02:02:58.428]  It's all over the news that most water systems are full of toxic poisons now, and you should be filtering it.
[02:02:58.848 --> 02:02:59.969]  We sell the highest rated.
[02:03:00.049 --> 02:03:01.070]  That's what you got to check.
[02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:03.392]  Everybody needs a water filter, but is it the highest rated?
[02:03:03.752 --> 02:03:07.695]  PrepareToday.com, high quality swearable food, ready to ship, the lowest prices you're going to find.
[02:03:08.015 --> 02:03:10.117]  But I got to tell you, they've been a sponsor.
[02:03:10.757 --> 02:03:12.779]  They've been trying to get me to even plug on air.
[02:03:12.819 --> 02:03:13.880]  I've been so busy, I haven't.
[02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:17.902]  But now I was reminded when Steve Quayle was coming on today, because he's the guy that introduced me.
[02:03:17.962 --> 02:03:30.271]  He's one of the top sellers in the country, lowest prices out there, great deals, free phone, free dongle, all you pay for is the service, that I should get Steve to talk about this, because I left these in boxes.
[02:03:30.531 --> 02:03:31.292]  I got them years ago.
[02:03:31.352 --> 02:03:32.853]  I tested one out, it worked great.
[02:03:33.113 --> 02:03:36.175]  I got one in my car, I got one at my house, but I'm getting them out now.
[02:03:36.235 --> 02:03:37.356]  I'm learning how to use them better.
[02:03:37.556 --> 02:03:41.258]  They're really easy to use like a regular phone, because we're in that world today.
[02:03:41.298 --> 02:03:47.217]   Go to InfoWarsPhone, one word, Infowarsphone.com and they come in next week.
[02:03:47.477 --> 02:03:49.978]  Everybody's been sold out of sat phones that are affordable for a long time.
[02:03:50.278 --> 02:03:51.099]  They got a big shipment in.
[02:03:51.139 --> 02:03:52.059]  They're ready to ship next week.
[02:03:52.860 --> 02:03:53.980]  All you pay for is a service.
[02:03:54.381 --> 02:03:56.662]  Go sign up now and you will be the first to get the phone.
[02:03:56.782 --> 02:04:03.546]  And they have the bivy stick dongles ready to just plug into your regular cell phone and turn it into a sat phone.
[02:04:03.866 --> 02:04:05.967]  They're only $55 a month.
[02:04:05.987 --> 02:04:08.508]  The service, the dongle is free.
[02:04:08.789 --> 02:04:11.830]  They got a lot of other incredible products at Infowarsphone.com.
[02:04:11.850 --> 02:04:16.289]   That just takes you as a sub link to the full page, these great folks, and then we get the sponsorship
[02:04:16.289 --> 02:04:18.010]  and it keeps us on air at 360.
[02:04:18.010 --> 02:04:19.689]  Wim, these are the best deals out there.
[02:04:19.689 --> 02:04:25.689]   Infowarsphone.com, infowarsphone.com, or 941-955-1020.
[02:04:25.689 --> 02:04:27.650]  Steve, anything else on the phone and the dongle?
[02:04:27.650 --> 02:04:32.810]   And then other amazing points you want to relate to folks, 'cause you are truly the maverick.
[02:04:32.810 --> 02:04:35.770]  Well, and I thank you for that, Alex.
[02:04:35.706 --> 02:04:39.651]  I think the thing is, alternative power is going to be a very important thing.
[02:04:39.771 --> 02:04:50.224]  I think one of the neat things about the satellite phone stores are selling the power generators, are selling the solar cells, all the charge converters and stuff, and they put together some nice packages.
[02:04:50.284 --> 02:04:54.704]   Now look, If a thousand people wanted it, they would absolutely bust
[02:04:54.704 --> 02:04:57.644]   the storage capability of America.
[02:04:57.644 --> 02:04:59.164]   And by the way, I'm interrupting you, but I love the owners of the company, they're
[02:04:59.164 --> 02:05:02.204]   great patriots, but they're like, "No, just plug these one products."
[02:05:02.204 --> 02:05:03.764]  I'm like, "No, you have everything."
[02:05:03.764 --> 02:05:05.485]  I mean, they need to go to Infowarsphone.com.
[02:05:05.485 --> 02:05:06.963]  I'm sorry, I'm going to shut up.
[02:05:06.963 --> 02:05:07.963]  Go ahead.
[02:05:07.963 --> 02:05:08.963]  No, no, no, no.
[02:05:08.978 --> 02:05:12.941]  I'm just saying that people ask me all the time, well, how do I charge it if there's no power?
[02:05:13.462 --> 02:05:14.623]  Easy, with solar.
[02:05:14.823 --> 02:05:19.687]  But let's talk about right now, too, the coming weatherized warfare.
[02:05:19.707 --> 02:05:22.490]  No, no, but I interrupted because I'm going to not do what they asked me to do.
[02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:24.872]  I want to talk about the other incredible products on the site.
[02:05:24.912 --> 02:05:25.633]  Tell folks about that.
[02:05:26.696 --> 02:05:27.377]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:05:27.577 --> 02:05:31.760]  First of all, they have the satellite phones back in stock.
[02:05:32.381 --> 02:05:33.061]  You mentioned that.
[02:05:33.121 --> 02:05:35.583]  A thousand of them, I believe, available at the end of October.
[02:05:35.904 --> 02:05:37.065]  They've got the bivy stick.
[02:05:37.105 --> 02:05:39.086]  The package comes with a free phone.
[02:05:39.547 --> 02:05:41.649]  All you're paying is $55 a month.
[02:05:41.949 --> 02:05:44.351]  They have satellite uplinks.
[02:05:44.391 --> 02:05:48.174]  They have the storage battery, the power solar generators.
[02:05:48.434 --> 02:06:14.419]   In essence, they are a one-stop communication And a electrical production facility because ladies and gentlemen you're being told you're being you're watching in real time that even the Swedish government saying hey to stay warm this winter you're gonna have to build a tent in your living room and huddle together the Germans are being told oh you won't have any power so take a cold shower and basically suck it up
[02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:37.090]   If anybody has got a let's say this a grasp of the situation Alex people need power the people in Florida I believe Florida is a microcosm of what is to come and so with the solar generators The solar cells, the power storage, and the communication that doesn't rely on the electrical grid of the United States.
[02:06:37.110 --> 02:06:37.430]  That's right.
[02:06:37.450 --> 02:06:48.159]  They've got small, easy to move, that work great batteries, with the best small compact solar systems, with the sat phones, with the communications, bivy sticks, everything you need at extremely low prices.
[02:06:49.230 --> 02:06:49.810]  Absolutely.
[02:06:50.071 --> 02:07:00.217]  And ladies and gentlemen, the reason why we're bringing this up today on this podcast, broadcast, forgive me, I do podcasts, Alex does broadcasts, is that we're running out of time.
[02:07:00.658 --> 02:07:15.047]  Ladies and gentlemen, in any nuclear war scenario, and Alex, I've offered to discuss with any Pentagon spokesman that wants to come on and debate me on a platform about the advanced weapons that exist in China, in Russia.
[02:07:15.487 --> 02:07:16.729]  And even in North Korea.
[02:07:17.610 --> 02:07:18.851]  Obviously, they're not going to do it.
[02:07:19.031 --> 02:07:29.924]  But the thing is, is that the anti-satellite rumors out there of the different systems that are blinding the eyes of our... Well, the Chinese have admittedly blown up U.S.
[02:07:29.944 --> 02:07:30.405]  satellites.
[02:07:31.155 --> 02:07:31.596]  They are.
[02:07:31.856 --> 02:07:32.096]  They are.
[02:07:32.136 --> 02:07:37.383]  But see, you can never, I can never, we can never, unless someone told us... I want to answer this question right now.
[02:07:37.604 --> 02:07:39.166]  How can you guys know this stuff?
[02:07:39.386 --> 02:07:44.653]  Well, simply because people who are in that world tell us because they're terrified themselves.
[02:07:44.933 --> 02:07:48.218]  How did you know about the human-animal hybrids, the chemtrails, before anybody else?
[02:07:49.278 --> 02:08:11.219]  Well, quite candidly, the bottom line is I had people telling me this, but I also went to the Bible, Genesis 6-4, and you guys sell my books, but the fallen angels, look, you use the word demon, there's a lot of demons out there, the disembodied spirit of the combination hybrids of fallen angels, earth women having sex, all of the mythologies of the world deal with that.
[02:08:11.679 --> 02:08:19.403]  But the hybridization of the human race is what Yuval Harari, the WFers, are telling everybody that God didn't do a good enough job.
[02:08:19.423 --> 02:08:19.783]  That's right.
[02:08:19.803 --> 02:08:21.884]  They're mainlining animal-human hybrids.
[02:08:22.024 --> 02:08:23.305]  They're saying it's happening.
[02:08:23.345 --> 02:08:23.665]  It's here.
[02:08:25.155 --> 02:08:25.535]  It's here!
[02:08:25.875 --> 02:08:28.577]  And you know, it's interesting because people used to give me so much crap.
[02:08:28.797 --> 02:08:38.921]  But even if you go to the old, if you will, the apocryphal works of Esdras, you know, the scribe, talking about your... I'm sorry, but this is what it says.
[02:08:39.181 --> 02:08:42.783]  Your ministrating women will give birth to monsters.
[02:08:43.223 --> 02:08:43.503]  You know?
[02:08:43.683 --> 02:08:56.113]  I mean, again, there's so much in ancient history, but the ancient history is now because even the Pentagon calls for the return of the gods, little g, of the Sumerians.
[02:08:56.233 --> 02:09:01.557]  In essence, the fallen angels are coming back, and the Book of Revelation is talking about this very time.
[02:09:01.777 --> 02:09:07.783]   The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse They're galloping through the world and people say, oh, I'm so scared.
[02:09:08.063 --> 02:09:12.208]  Well, you shouldn't be scared because in essence, that's why you should support Alex.
[02:09:12.248 --> 02:09:13.510]  And listen, I want this clear.
[02:09:15.123 --> 02:09:23.689]  If people do not support your platform and the absolute necessity of the spear of the point, look, you're like an icebreaker.
[02:09:23.989 --> 02:09:25.610]  You're the bowel of an icebreaker.
[02:09:25.770 --> 02:09:27.351]  You have broken the ice.
[02:09:27.751 --> 02:09:28.572]  This is the truth.
[02:09:28.672 --> 02:09:29.212]  It's history.
[02:09:29.412 --> 02:09:34.596]  I was able to, you know, have some input into your life, but you still have been out there.
[02:09:34.676 --> 02:09:35.716]  You don't give in.
[02:09:36.097 --> 02:09:38.838]  Ladies and gentlemen, most people never step into the battle.
[02:09:39.159 --> 02:09:41.500]  And those are Alex's critics or my critics.
[02:09:41.780 --> 02:09:43.221]  They're Doug Hagman's critics of people.
[02:09:43.241 --> 02:09:44.222]  They're Mike Adams critics.
[02:09:44.642 --> 02:09:57.351]  People who don't understand, I'm sorry, I'm passionate today, the lateness of the hour, we're talking about an intercontinental ballistic missile launch, we're talking, you'll never know the true defense condition of the U.S.
[02:09:57.411 --> 02:10:03.736]  military, and we don't have the military assets, the advanced weapons, and this isn't pro-Russia.
[02:10:04.016 --> 02:10:04.837]  This is the truth.
[02:10:04.877 --> 02:10:06.458]  The truth is not propaganda.
[02:10:07.018 --> 02:10:08.740]  We've been undermined intentionally.
[02:10:08.780 --> 02:10:11.263]  That was the whole vaccine mandate with the troops.
[02:10:11.303 --> 02:10:14.126]  Now the army had a 15% underage in the recruits.
[02:10:14.146 --> 02:10:16.108]  The recruits they got, I gotta say, are pathetic.
[02:10:17.205 --> 02:10:25.913]  Yeah, and so, ladies and gentlemen, we only have so many hours or so many days left before a very provocative incident happens.
[02:10:26.093 --> 02:10:28.715]  Already, it looks like there's a weak countdown.
[02:10:28.775 --> 02:10:33.119]  I can't say I know this for sure, but a weak countdown for a false flag in Ukraine.
[02:10:33.439 --> 02:10:37.223]  They will blame the Russians, and then NATO will invoke Article 5.
[02:10:37.703 --> 02:10:38.424]  Hold on, stay there.
[02:10:38.504 --> 02:10:39.104]  One more segment.
[02:10:39.124 --> 02:10:42.327]  I want to hear all about the Ukraine false flag from the Maverick Trailblazer, Steve Quill.
[02:10:43.308 --> 02:10:46.929]  I read his stuff 30 years ago and thought, well, he's very articulate and part of it I can prove, but this sounds crazy.
[02:10:47.209 --> 02:10:47.929]  It all came true.
[02:10:48.189 --> 02:10:49.069]  I wish it wasn't true.
[02:10:49.470 --> 02:10:52.850]  Back in two minutes with the one, the only Steve Quayle, stevequayle.com.
[02:10:54.271 --> 02:10:55.531]  stevequayle.com.
[02:10:56.111 --> 02:10:56.351]  All right.
[02:10:56.391 --> 02:11:03.013]  I was just talking to Steve during the break and he said, listen, I know the attack you guys are under, you need to fundraise.
[02:11:03.709 --> 02:11:04.610]  And he's absolutely right.
[02:11:04.670 --> 02:11:10.075]  We are behind over a half million dollars right now because of the legal bills and the attacks and everything else.
[02:11:10.976 --> 02:11:16.801]  Once we're over these big judgments and these show trials that are ending as we speak, the appeals are very inexpensive compared to those.
[02:11:17.202 --> 02:11:21.506]  We'll be able to block those for two years and by then we're going to fix this or turn this around or it's all over anyways.
[02:11:21.946 --> 02:11:23.027]  So we got to stay on air.
[02:11:23.588 --> 02:11:26.191]  I'm announcing a special 8 a.m.
[02:11:26.671 --> 02:11:29.194]  to midnight broadcast.
[02:11:29.234 --> 02:11:32.458]  We'll have the regular shows, also my show, but we're gonna have Steve Quill and others.
[02:11:32.838 --> 02:11:34.300]  Wednesday night we're going to midnight.
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:37.283]  Steve Quill will be on 6 to 8 central.
[02:11:38.024 --> 02:11:42.848]  Uh, seven to eight mountain and he'll lay all this out and more, but enough about support and info wars.
[02:11:43.068 --> 02:11:44.670]  You were, let's talk about the big picture.
[02:11:45.090 --> 02:11:46.851]  I feel, I see a false flag.
[02:11:46.891 --> 02:11:49.313]  You show the preparation in Ukraine for nuclear.
[02:11:49.373 --> 02:11:50.194]  You see that too.
[02:11:50.454 --> 02:11:53.477]  In the four minutes we have left, Steve, tell us about what you're most concerned about.
[02:11:54.855 --> 02:12:24.925]   I'm most concerned about a false flag that is going to be blamed on the Russians, but also, Alex, with the removal of the children and the women and mothers and children, obviously babies and stuff, out of the four rejoined to the Russia, we'll call them former parts of Russia, I believe there is going to be a very serious nuclear or hyperbaric weapon demonstration.
[02:12:24.925 --> 02:12:29.666]   I think that the vilification of President Putin is off the charts.
[02:12:29.666 --> 02:12:32.786]   You watched it happen, ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump, and the
[02:12:32.786 --> 02:12:36.786]   globalists are the ones that are doing their best to put Russia and the
[02:12:36.786 --> 02:12:40.265]  United States at war and Lucifer himself wants the war.
[02:12:40.376 --> 02:12:42.676]  He wants the maximum amount of death.
[02:12:42.696 --> 02:12:45.817]  He doesn't care who does it, he just wants to make sure it gets done.
[02:12:46.137 --> 02:12:56.760]  So, when Zelensky said, and he's backtracking it right now, that the United States needs, he was inferring, to attack Russia with nuclear weapons, ladies and gentlemen, are you ready to pay $17 a gallon for gas?
[02:12:59.853 --> 02:13:00.513]  17 bucks a gallon.
[02:13:00.734 --> 02:13:03.056]  Are you willing to go without heat?
[02:13:03.376 --> 02:13:04.197]  Are you willing?
[02:13:04.437 --> 02:13:15.569]  And 70 billion dollars, actually it's more than that, 100 billion now, that has gone into the Ukraine, and 80% of it, Alex, is going out the back doors of Ukraine.
[02:13:16.209 --> 02:13:19.693]  All the weapons we're giving them, they're going out on the black market.
[02:13:20.013 --> 02:13:30.125]  Now, obviously you're saying some of them, but ladies and gentlemen, please understand, when we attacked the Nord Stream Pipeline, that was a direct act of war.
[02:13:30.806 --> 02:13:51.978]   When we are having our liquid natural gas tankers Going across selling US LNG at more expensive prices than the Russians were, I want everyone to understand that if somebody loves their country and they're a nationalist and they want to protect their people, I can tell you this, it's interesting to me
[02:13:52.858 --> 02:13:53.939]  And this is really critical.
[02:13:54.359 --> 02:13:57.122]  Russia has an active civil defense.
[02:13:57.542 --> 02:13:59.764]  They are able to shield their population.
[02:14:00.024 --> 02:14:03.286]  They are able to shield their manufacturing.
[02:14:03.326 --> 02:14:07.289]  They are on a wartime footing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[02:14:08.570 --> 02:14:13.713]  And ladies and gentlemen, we're running out of, quote, all of our weapons, and some of the generals have warned about it.
[02:14:14.093 --> 02:14:24.959]  You're watching the internal destruction of the United States, a communist takeover and takedown, and the finishing touch is going to be a nuclear-launched strategic weapons against the United States.
[02:14:25.279 --> 02:14:34.225]  Now, I believe that God can do anything, but unfortunately, remember this, the very party that's pushing nuclear war made war on God.
[02:14:34.285 --> 02:14:36.646]  They said, God has no place on our platform.
[02:14:37.106 --> 02:14:43.313]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you history records nations with that attitude as disappearing from off the earth.
[02:14:43.573 --> 02:14:46.557]  And I think that people better realize that, Alex.
[02:14:46.897 --> 02:14:50.762]  We're not on a multi-month countdown, in my opinion, okay?
[02:14:50.982 --> 02:14:51.863]  I pray I'm wrong.
[02:14:52.383 --> 02:15:04.955]   We are on a moment-by-moment, day-by-day, what would you say, Threat level that is increasing beyond anybody's ability to grasp and apply it.
[02:15:04.995 --> 02:15:06.956]  Now, they can grasp it, but apply it to your life.
[02:15:07.196 --> 02:15:11.780]  And I'm calling it the day everything you've known before is gone forever.
[02:15:12.100 --> 02:15:12.400]  Okay?
[02:15:12.741 --> 02:15:13.961]  It's not just a day of the dollar.
[02:15:13.981 --> 02:15:15.703]  And Klaus Schwab's been saying, get ready for that.
[02:15:15.743 --> 02:15:16.824]  You'll own nothing, you'll have nothing.
[02:15:17.104 --> 02:15:19.285]  You won't live in cities, you'll live in communes.
[02:15:19.606 --> 02:15:20.526]  I mean, they are doing this.
[02:15:22.028 --> 02:15:22.348]  They are.
[02:15:22.648 --> 02:15:25.670]  And so again, ladies and gentlemen, this is how late the hour is.
[02:15:26.151 --> 02:15:27.471]  Please get behind Alex.
[02:15:27.531 --> 02:15:30.853]  I'm excited to be able to join on the fundraiser on Wednesday.
[02:15:30.933 --> 02:15:38.858]  But ladies and gentlemen, if I am asking 1,000 of you, OK, who are capable and you know who you are financially, I'll put the first 1,000 in.
[02:15:38.878 --> 02:15:40.839]  I'll PayPal Alex within.
[02:15:40.859 --> 02:15:43.981]  And I don't believe in telling you to do something.
[02:15:44.001 --> 02:15:44.382]  Hold on.
[02:15:44.402 --> 02:15:44.722]  Stay there.
[02:15:44.762 --> 02:15:45.522]  Back in 60 seconds.
[02:15:45.562 --> 02:15:47.864]  SaveInfoWars.com is the current place.
[02:15:48.744 --> 02:16:07.001]  Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com, best-selling author, founding prepper, guy that predicted everything that's now happening to a tee, was getting into the fact that we've got to keep liberty instruments like InfoWars on air during this critical time, and you're also going to finish up with just the laissez-faire attitude as we sleepwalk into Armageddon.
[02:16:08.553 --> 02:16:21.423]  Well, in essence, again, the cavalier attitude, it's as if, Alex, everybody is listening to the battle plan and going, well, as long as it doesn't hit me, I'm okay.
[02:16:21.904 --> 02:16:26.107]  Everything you know and all your freedoms, liberties, they've already gone.
[02:16:26.567 --> 02:16:31.671]  Look, every estimate is if there's a tactical nuke used, it's going to go regional and probably planet wide.
[02:16:31.691 --> 02:16:33.833]  I mean, we are on the verge of destruction.
[02:16:34.895 --> 02:16:37.876]  Yeah, and I want to change the term tactical, okay?
[02:16:37.976 --> 02:16:41.237]  We're talking tactical weapons that are in the kiloton region.
[02:16:41.257 --> 02:16:42.657]  We're talking about region.
[02:16:42.917 --> 02:16:44.938]  We're talking strategic nuclear weapons.
[02:16:45.218 --> 02:16:47.759]  We're in the 25 megaton realm.
[02:16:47.819 --> 02:17:01.883]  And by the way, the Russians have their Satan 1 and Satan 2, and by the way, those were named in honor of the United States, multi-targeted reentry vehicle warheads that have multiple warheads in each rocket.
[02:17:02.303 --> 02:17:06.264]   They are on, I'm told, Five minute launch command.
[02:17:06.724 --> 02:17:08.525]  They have their targets already picked.
[02:17:08.585 --> 02:17:12.007]  And by the way, none of this stuff is being done in secret.
[02:17:12.367 --> 02:17:21.151]  I don't know what more, honestly, people could do than expect from Russia when they're being told daily, daily.
[02:17:21.751 --> 02:17:23.912]  This is all about stopping World War III, everyone.
[02:17:24.572 --> 02:17:27.753]  It is, they're being told daily, we're going to nuke you.
[02:17:27.953 --> 02:17:32.475]  Zelensky says to the United States, then tries to walk it back, you guys should nuke Russia.
[02:17:32.835 --> 02:17:37.797]  Well, the bottom line is we don't even have newer warheads.
[02:17:37.877 --> 02:17:40.138]  We don't even have the missiles.
[02:17:40.158 --> 02:17:43.079]  Half the commanders literally are in dresses and wearing red high heels.
[02:17:44.033 --> 02:17:45.855]  Right, and I said this and I stand by it.
[02:17:45.935 --> 02:17:46.876]  Let me tell you something.
[02:17:46.996 --> 02:17:55.524]  Women's panties on men and red high heels or leather bondage sadomasochism heads of the Department of Energy.
[02:17:57.807 --> 02:18:03.613]  High heel shoes are not a very effective defense against hypersonic missiles.
[02:18:03.673 --> 02:18:09.196]   By the way, Russia said in 90 seconds From our submarine-launched ballistic missiles.
[02:18:09.817 --> 02:18:12.859]  This place disappears, this place disappears, this place disappears.
[02:18:13.460 --> 02:18:22.827]  And, you know, putting aircraft carriers out to sea, when a hundred megaton nuclear weapon is underneath you, is not really modern warfare any longer.
[02:18:22.867 --> 02:18:25.369]   So, in essence, There is no sanity.
[02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:27.211]  There is no rationale, in my opinion.
[02:18:27.491 --> 02:18:30.334]  There's just a provocation of World War III.
[02:18:30.414 --> 02:18:41.525]  And Alex, I think what people have got to understand is the Bible's very clear about this, that the Antichrist is waiting in the wings to come on as a man of peace after, of course, a nuclear war.
[02:18:41.985 --> 02:18:47.431]  You've got to scare humanity into accepting the ultimate world dictator.
[02:18:47.931 --> 02:19:00.917]  And now we've heard that from the mouth of the Pope, One World Religion, we're hearing about the One World Digital Currency, and of course the World Economic Foundation, a One World Government, where you'll own nothing, I'll own nothing.
[02:19:01.798 --> 02:19:05.359]  How crazy is it how vindicated you and others are?
[02:19:05.399 --> 02:19:10.662]  I mean, I've been around 28 years, been around 35 years, but totally vindicated now.
[02:19:10.682 --> 02:19:11.842]  I don't see that as a positive.
[02:19:11.882 --> 02:19:12.563]  I feel sick.
[02:19:13.143 --> 02:19:20.309]  We were unable to stop this but I mean we are totally vindicated and they just hope censorship makes us go away but we've proven we know what we're talking about.
[02:19:21.403 --> 02:19:37.700]  Well, yeah, and again, they can call it conspiracy all they want, but when you and I were talking just about social media being, if you will, a projection of the Stasi, Marcus Wolf, and I remember you and I did a broadcast, podcast, what, 10 years ago?
[02:19:38.281 --> 02:19:43.847]  Yeah, I remember Obama hired the former head of the Stasi, then Google hired Stasi to help set up their system.
[02:19:44.810 --> 02:19:53.533]  Yep, and so ladies and gentlemen, you know, everything you think, do and say is in the spine they're doing at you every day.
[02:19:53.913 --> 02:19:57.674]  And now it's not enough just to have external means, they want internal means.
[02:19:57.974 --> 02:20:00.335]  So they want the neural link, they want this, they want that.
[02:20:00.695 --> 02:20:02.616]  And I want people to understand this.
[02:20:03.116 --> 02:20:09.498]  Total control is at the end of everything that the World Economic Foundation is going.
[02:20:09.938 --> 02:20:12.299]  And, you know, Yuval Harari is very clear.
[02:20:12.959 --> 02:20:16.442]  He's basically saying the majority of the planet has to die.
[02:20:16.502 --> 02:20:17.583]  You're useless eaters.
[02:20:17.643 --> 02:20:18.763]  He said that exactly.
[02:20:18.783 --> 02:20:20.665]  He said the future is not human.
[02:20:21.665 --> 02:20:22.146]  You got it.
[02:20:22.486 --> 02:20:29.251]  So when you said that in one of your books, I forget which one, I read over 20 years ago, it actually says their plan is for there not to be a human future.
[02:20:30.242 --> 02:20:33.324]  Yep, and that was genetic Armageddon, which you carried in those days.
[02:20:33.685 --> 02:20:37.328]  And now the book that's really important is terminated.
[02:20:37.728 --> 02:20:40.810]  The end of man is here, not near.
[02:20:41.191 --> 02:21:02.055]   So when you hear about H+, Humanity+, when you hear about the genetic manipulation of the human genome, when you hear about the introduction of a microbiome controlled operating system within your body, And remember this, anything they put in you can be controlled to destroy you at a moment's notice.
[02:21:02.516 --> 02:21:11.996]   And so now we're seeing, and I'm sorry, we're seeing this I came into my office today knowing I would be doing this, but my manager, Daryl, said, what's the matter?
[02:21:12.376 --> 02:21:15.118]  I said, I've never felt the sick of my stomach.
[02:21:15.459 --> 02:21:28.288]  It's one thing to write about it decades in advance, but it's another thing to see people blissfully unaware, not even realizing what is at their front door.
[02:21:28.729 --> 02:21:30.991]  And what happens if Russia takes out 10 cities?
[02:21:31.291 --> 02:21:32.272]  They're gone in a flash.
[02:21:32.292 --> 02:21:39.240]   And by the way, Putin also said, and the defense minister said, we're not going to just hit one city, another city, another city.
[02:21:39.461 --> 02:21:42.387]  He said all of our missiles will hit at once.
[02:21:43.112 --> 02:21:44.573]  I don't think people understand that.
[02:21:44.753 --> 02:21:46.214]  I pay attention to what they say.
[02:21:46.694 --> 02:21:51.636]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we're fighting for your lives, your children.
[02:21:51.676 --> 02:21:53.057]  This isn't melodrama.
[02:21:53.417 --> 02:21:54.297]  This is the truth.
[02:21:54.317 --> 02:21:59.580]  This isn't some Netflix show, and people psychologically confuse all the entertainment and all these programs with reality.
[02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:00.760]  This is reality.
[02:22:01.120 --> 02:22:01.821]  SteveQuell.com.
[02:22:01.841 --> 02:22:03.422]  Steve, you've been with us for two hours.
[02:22:03.922 --> 02:22:05.983]  Wednesday night, special emergency broadcast.
[02:22:06.303 --> 02:22:07.143]  SteveQuell.com.
[02:22:07.203 --> 02:22:08.324]  I hope we're here on Wednesday.
[02:22:08.644 --> 02:22:10.425]  God bless you, sir, and thank you so much for the time.
[02:22:11.380 --> 02:22:11.880]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:22:11.940 --> 02:22:13.560]  And people, get behind this.
[02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:18.161]  And seriously, 1,000 people, go to... Alex, what's your website where they can donate?
[02:22:18.181 --> 02:22:21.322]  SaveInfoWars.com is where I need the funds to keep the legal battle going.
[02:22:21.342 --> 02:22:22.142]  That's the most important.
[02:22:22.162 --> 02:22:23.362]  100% will go towards that.
[02:22:23.722 --> 02:22:25.082]  We're about to finish these show trials.
[02:22:25.122 --> 02:22:26.203]  We've got two years of appeals.
[02:22:26.503 --> 02:22:28.623]  That'll buy us the time to stay on air, but we don't have the funds.
[02:22:28.643 --> 02:22:30.023]  I want to thank those that did donate.
[02:22:30.123 --> 02:22:31.824]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[02:22:31.844 --> 02:22:32.404]  Thank you, Steve.
[02:22:33.284 --> 02:22:33.944]  I'll PayPal you $1,000.
[02:22:33.984 --> 02:22:37.905]  I want you to put it up, and I want those 1,000 people to join with me, okay?
[02:22:38.065 --> 02:22:38.605]  I need it, sir.
[02:22:38.645 --> 02:22:39.405]  Thank you, and God bless you.
[02:22:40.251 --> 02:22:41.312]  Amazing person, folks.
[02:22:41.352 --> 02:22:42.312]  He's always been articulate.
[02:22:42.332 --> 02:22:46.595]  I always thought he was a great guest, but when I first interviewed him 28 years ago, he was one of my first big guests.
[02:22:46.655 --> 02:22:49.977]  I thought, this guy is like a great science fiction writer, and it all came true.
[02:22:50.097 --> 02:22:50.918]  It's just sick.
[02:22:52.158 --> 02:22:53.619]  Jay Dyer is a great researcher.
[02:22:53.639 --> 02:23:00.624]  He's about to take over for the next 45 minutes, and he has all their documents, all their admissions to be able to speak to what's currently happening and everything that's going on.
[02:23:02.388 --> 02:23:04.109]  Steve Quayle has just been a godsend over the years.
[02:23:04.129 --> 02:23:08.991]  You know, he's not even getting paid to come on and plug InfoWarsPhone.com and that big satellite phone company.
[02:23:09.011 --> 02:23:09.732]  He just believes in it.

[02:23:11.873 --> 02:23:12.773]  He knows I'm a straight shooter.
[02:23:12.793 --> 02:23:14.354]  He knows when I say we're out of money, we're out of money.
[02:23:14.954 --> 02:23:17.415]  And we're the enemy's main target.

[02:23:46.773 --> 02:23:53.013]   It's 8.25 billion, 550 million per plaintiff as if I killed their kids.
[02:23:53.013 --> 02:23:58.292]   They didn't say how much they want for emotional distress or this cut claim or their legal
[02:23:58.683 --> 02:23:59.644]  They're saying it's nine million.
[02:24:00.244 --> 02:24:01.885]  The great news is we're in bankruptcy.
[02:24:01.905 --> 02:24:02.626]  They can't ever get it.
[02:24:02.926 --> 02:24:03.526]  It doesn't matter.

[02:26:45.838 --> 02:26:47.399]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:47.419 --> 02:26:49.362]  This is your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[02:26:49.422 --> 02:27:01.176]   Of Jay's Analysis, as you know, I weekly lecture through the writings of the global elite to give you a Inside understanding directly from their really boring long tones and texts.
[02:27:01.357 --> 02:27:02.499]  I do your homework for you.
[02:27:02.679 --> 02:27:04.022]  Nobody else wants to read these books.
[02:27:04.062 --> 02:27:07.850]  Hardly anybody but the global elite actually read these books and then I read them.
[02:27:08.467 --> 02:27:12.769]  So then I can digest it and tell you exactly what the plans are.
[02:27:12.789 --> 02:27:19.212]  And it's always important to look back at the plans that they wrote 150, 30 years ago.
[02:27:19.792 --> 02:27:30.958]  And today I want to highlight an important paper that was written in terms of international relations and American geopolitical strategy and it's called Soft Power by Joseph Nye Jr.
[02:27:30.998 --> 02:27:39.744]   He is, of course, one of the Kennedy School of Government Harvard Rhodes Scholarship guys, so we know he's coming out of the circles of Oxford University.
[02:27:40.344 --> 02:27:46.845]  This will be essentially people promoting the Rhodes, Milner, Rothschild, etc.
[02:27:46.945 --> 02:28:08.183]   worldview, because typically people on the Eastern Seaboard, elite universities, Harvard, Yale, Cambridge, excuse me, Princeton, and then, you know, they go over to Oxford and Cambridge in the UK, they get sort of co-opted into or sort of Coaxed into the two fake arms of the establishment at a higher geopolitical level.
[02:28:08.263 --> 02:28:13.404]  So just like in the U.S., we have the fake left-right Democrat-Republican idea.
[02:28:13.524 --> 02:28:23.427]  In terms of global geopolitics, there's a similar kind of dialectic between older strategies of Fabian socialism that was so-called liberal elitism in the U.K.
[02:28:23.487 --> 02:28:27.028]  and then a more right-wing supposed opposition to that.
[02:28:27.048 --> 02:28:35.255]   But in actual fact, the elites above That we're funding both sides of the false left-right dialectic in the UK as well.
[02:28:36.216 --> 02:28:47.610]  These international leader also allied with the internationalist from the American power structure, and this would of course be the JP Morgan's, the Rockefeller power structure, etc.
[02:28:48.715 --> 02:28:53.696]  And so out of this sphere, we get a lot of people who are ideologues and who are the brains, right?
[02:28:53.756 --> 02:28:58.217]  Not so much the, we got the banks, we got the corporations, and we got the brains.
[02:28:58.777 --> 02:29:01.358]  And the brains would be the people like the Brzezinskis and the Kissingers.
[02:29:01.438 --> 02:29:05.879]  And we could count Joseph Nye in this category of global elite writers.
[02:29:06.459 --> 02:29:13.381]  And so he wrote, he was actually listed by Foreign Policy Magazine in 2011 as one of the top global thinkers in the world.
[02:29:14.446 --> 02:29:15.006]  And why is that?
[02:29:15.046 --> 02:29:19.747]  Well, he wrote this famous paper right after the Cold War was winding down in 1990.
[02:29:19.867 --> 02:29:21.468]  It's called Soft Power.
[02:29:22.008 --> 02:29:28.069]  Soft Power is important because it's one of the key strategies that the elite have used for a long time.
[02:29:28.149 --> 02:29:34.490]  It's really a Fabian socialist strategy, but it's not restricted to people of that ideology.
[02:29:34.510 --> 02:29:40.452]  It can be used by anybody and it's really crucial to understand because it's part of cultural warfare.
[02:29:40.552 --> 02:29:49.938]   You know, I've talked for a long time about how Toxic culture and culture warfare is crucial to how the agenda marches forward despite whoever's in public office.
[02:29:50.578 --> 02:29:58.584]  And that's because the agenda is planned at a higher level by think tanks, NGOs, and international corporations and organizations.
[02:29:58.985 --> 02:30:02.727]  This is admitted in this essay, so you understand that this is not a conspiracy text.
[02:30:02.747 --> 02:30:07.331]  This is a text from people in the Harvard circles.
[02:30:08.012 --> 02:30:13.618]  Harvard had a huge role, for example, in the looting of Russia when the Soviet Union collapsed.
[02:30:13.638 --> 02:30:21.587]  You had a lot of oligarchs who then sort of auctioned off in a fire sale a lot of the assets of Russia when the Soviet Union collapsed.
[02:30:21.607 --> 02:30:26.313]  That was all done by design, and some of the architects of that were at Harvard University.
[02:30:27.347 --> 02:30:28.868]  So what does he mean by soft power?
[02:30:28.908 --> 02:30:32.131]  Why is this so crucial to understanding how the global elite work?
[02:30:32.151 --> 02:30:41.158]  Well, he's surprisingly at the time when he wrote this in 1990, you would think he would be writing about the Soviet Union declining.
[02:30:41.198 --> 02:30:45.501]  But in fact, he writes about the United States in decline.
[02:30:47.943 --> 02:30:55.110]   And that's because the Cold War really had this in-game That was long-term in terms of the global government.
[02:30:55.550 --> 02:31:12.897]  A lot of people think that the Cold War was just about defeating evil atheism and communism, but actually it was about a long-term game that some of the higher-level strategists had for bringing about the marriage of East and West into a third way, or what the Fabians called the New World Order.
[02:31:13.037 --> 02:31:17.199]  Yes, actually that term, the New World Order, was coined by famous Fabians like H.G.
[02:31:17.239 --> 02:31:41.745]   Wells Now again, Fabian's economics doesn't restrict itself to somebody who's an outright Marxist-Socialist, because as we know from a lot of the writings that I've covered, including Quigley, Professor Anthony Sutton, or Yohann Ratziou that I recently have been lecturing through in his really copiously footnoted books, we know that the game plan
[02:31:43.106 --> 02:31:49.169]  For Fabian's Socialists for an International Order is identical to the game plan for the Monopoly Capitalists International Order.
[02:31:49.249 --> 02:31:59.693]  And that's because Fabian's Socialism, slow kill Marxism in other words, had the exact same funding as the people who are pushing Monopoly Capitalism control.
[02:32:00.053 --> 02:32:05.576]  So in other words, it's the same ideology, they might differ at times on how to get there, but it's the same end goal.
[02:32:06.369 --> 02:32:10.893]  And essentially, this is going to be admitted and demonstrated in Nye's own essay.
[02:32:11.273 --> 02:32:14.456]  He doesn't mention Fabianism, but he doesn't have to because it's all the same plan.
[02:32:14.496 --> 02:32:29.968]  It's all the plan for a world order structured around a global currency, a global government, and the removal of the existing nation-state firewall and the removal of the existing currencies that will put us into this debt-based international credit system.
[02:32:30.934 --> 02:32:35.617]  Something like FedCoin, something like CBDC, whatever, wherever it goes, we don't know yet.
[02:32:35.997 --> 02:32:41.160]  But they're already now beginning to talk about the very things that these people said a hundred years ago.
[02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:43.922]  Remember Bertrand Russell talking about the credit system.
[02:32:44.982 --> 02:32:45.142]  H.G.
[02:32:45.162 --> 02:32:52.046]  Wells talking about the credit system, the universal basic income system that would be rolled out and here we are a hundred years later and it's being rolled out.
[02:32:52.547 --> 02:33:02.761]   Nye says that Really, the breakdown of the existing order after the Renaissance is due to the World Wars of the 20th century.
[02:33:02.781 --> 02:33:11.289]  This is the same analysis that Quigley has, that World War I, II, and the Cold War really break down all of the previous existing international orders.
[02:33:12.110 --> 02:33:15.052]  And this includes the notion of traditional warfare breaking down.
[02:33:15.313 --> 02:33:29.900]   So, this is warfare That is exercised primarily through external power or through actual force is being replaced by a multipolar supposed order that will be centered around what he calls soft power.
[02:33:30.040 --> 02:33:37.806]  That is influencing nations and power blocks through non-warfare means.
[02:33:37.926 --> 02:33:42.810]  Non, you know, not actual warfare but through culture, for example.
[02:33:44.065 --> 02:33:49.627]  So he says that the Cold War saw not just the decline of the U.S., but also the decline of Russia as well.
[02:33:49.648 --> 02:33:56.891]  And he says that there are new actors emerging that will be the new locus of power as we go into the future.
[02:33:56.911 --> 02:34:03.467]   And he's going to be totally accurate about this because some of these new power structures that emerged We'll be corporations.
[02:34:03.947 --> 02:34:09.432]  In other words, corporations will arise that will be more powerful than nation-state.
[02:34:09.732 --> 02:34:16.018]  Now, we're not at the point yet where there's a single global corp that runs everything, but we're definitely moving in that direction.
[02:34:16.118 --> 02:34:24.686]  I think everybody can see this when we look at the way that big food, for example, is being more and more consolidated under a couple big agri-companies.
[02:34:25.426 --> 02:34:30.670]  The drugs are being consolidated under, you know, a few mega pharmaceutical corporations.
[02:34:30.830 --> 02:34:35.193]  Media is being consolidated under a handful of mega media corporations.
[02:34:35.373 --> 02:34:45.139]  And that same trend will probably continue until we get corporations that may end up being more powerful than any existing nation-state today.
[02:34:45.199 --> 02:34:49.882]  Now, that's a long way away, but it's definitely possible given where we're going.
[02:34:50.063 --> 02:34:57.017]   And so he says power over nations Is something that was considered beneficial in the older order.
[02:34:57.177 --> 02:35:01.661]  Now power over the outcomes of events is considered more important.
[02:35:01.681 --> 02:35:06.204]  And that's because of the rise of new actors that we've never seen before.
[02:35:06.224 --> 02:35:08.446]  And that is the international corporate structure.
[02:35:09.218 --> 02:35:18.345]  He says this is creating a more and more interdependent world, and that's what monopoly capitalism intended on creating with completely open borders, completely free trade.
[02:35:18.765 --> 02:35:23.228]  This was to create and erect this totally interlinked global economy.
[02:35:23.989 --> 02:35:24.529]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:35:24.569 --> 02:35:25.570]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:25.590 --> 02:35:29.553]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, as we break down soft power from the elite themselves.
[02:35:30.362 --> 02:35:31.463]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:31.483 --> 02:35:40.130]  We are breaking down the crucial geopolitical essay, which is now a little bit dated, but it's very important to understand in terms of getting how we got to where we are now.
[02:35:40.150 --> 02:35:44.214]  This is the 1990 essay by Joseph Nye called Soft Power.
[02:35:44.654 --> 02:35:54.141]   It talks about how the world was constructed into an interdependent Free market in the sense of free trade global order, right?
[02:35:54.181 --> 02:35:57.424]  I'm not talking about legitimate free market capitalism.
[02:35:57.464 --> 02:36:11.353]  I'm talking about monopoly capitalism that engineers ways to construct an international global order for the benefit of a choice elect or choice select small percentage of oligarchs.
[02:36:11.413 --> 02:36:13.054]  That's the real world that we're living in now.
[02:36:13.134 --> 02:36:18.998]  And it's totally compatible with the Fabian socialist model of collectivism.
[02:36:19.873 --> 02:36:31.181]  If you remember in 1984, when Winston is looking into the counter, the movement he thinks is against the establishment, right?
[02:36:31.221 --> 02:36:41.368]  Goldstein, and he thinks that Goldstein has written this book, The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism, and how you fight against this and how you, you know, beat the establishment.
[02:36:41.488 --> 02:36:44.230]  In reality, we find out that there was no Goldstein.
[02:36:44.270 --> 02:36:46.191]  He was a completely made-up creature.
[02:36:47.354 --> 02:36:49.816]  A cut out, a kind of a Bin Laden type of character.
[02:36:49.856 --> 02:36:55.039]  And in reality, the writing was actually written by O'Brien, right?
[02:36:55.079 --> 02:37:04.466]  The theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism and how to defeat it, whatever, the revolutionary propaganda was created by the guy running the Big Brother system.
[02:37:04.946 --> 02:37:12.571]  And this is in Orwell's novel, intentionally meant to characterize Fabian socialism.
[02:37:12.671 --> 02:37:19.150]   He is writing about Bernard Shaw, Lord Milner, and all of the Fabian elites that were pushing
[02:37:19.150 --> 02:37:24.930]   and moving Britain into a slow version of socialism, which is almost completely where
[02:37:24.930 --> 02:37:25.930]  they've gone now.
[02:37:25.930 --> 02:37:33.111]   They've almost completely adopted a kind of Fabian model, and this is not even hidden
[02:37:33.598 --> 02:37:39.380]  In fact, they've had many, you know, Tony Blair, for example, was an open supporter of the Fabian Society.
[02:37:39.620 --> 02:37:43.882]  And that doesn't mean that their fake right-wing opponents are actually against Fabianism.
[02:37:43.902 --> 02:37:52.785]  They're actually part of the same supra-international structure, which is allied with zillion, zillion, zillion dollar mega, mega, mega capitalism.
[02:37:54.545 --> 02:37:55.946]  That's the reality of the world.
[02:37:56.007 --> 02:37:58.629]  And when you read these kinds of books, you start to figure that out.
[02:37:58.689 --> 02:38:00.691]  And these writings by, for example, Nye.
[02:38:01.152 --> 02:38:22.302]   So Nye goes back to how we got to where we were in his day in the 90s by talking about the 70s and the 80s and how international corporations are really coming into power, into focus by Taking over various markets and he talks about how one of the things that we saw at this time here was economic warfare.
[02:38:22.822 --> 02:38:30.070]  Economic warfare became a key element in the global elite's attack on other countries.
[02:38:30.130 --> 02:38:36.617]  And he says that international agencies then stepped up to be engaged in this economic warfare.
[02:38:37.543 --> 02:38:40.446]  Kind of a predecessor to cyber security at this time.
[02:38:40.846 --> 02:38:47.212]  This is the these international agencies became elements and corporations became elements of soft power.
[02:38:48.433 --> 02:39:04.547]  Power shifted away from the balance of powers in the Cold War to this new structure where there's an interdependence in the whole world, which was the purpose of the Cold War was to create this interdependent neoliberal order.
[02:39:05.999 --> 02:39:14.185]  That could then transition into a new phase, which will become the War on Terror, and that will become where we are now, this new type of war.
[02:39:14.265 --> 02:39:16.127]  Isn't it convenient the War on Terror just kind of went away?
[02:39:16.147 --> 02:39:22.568]   Does nobody question why it is that The terrorists just suddenly stopped being terrorists?
[02:39:22.648 --> 02:39:30.992]  Are we supposed to actually believe that that was because Obama and Joe Biden defeated the terrorists and defeated Al-Qaeda and ISIS and all this nonsense, right?
[02:39:31.352 --> 02:39:35.794]  Those are all cut-out puppets, in my view, that the West actually runs anyway.
[02:39:36.555 --> 02:39:38.896]  And he hints at that in this essay.
[02:39:38.976 --> 02:39:49.179]   He hints that, you know, if you think about the War on Terror, you know, this was basically The holdovers from Brzezinski's Mujahideen allies, right?
[02:39:49.539 --> 02:39:53.120]  The Soviet war in Afghanistan.
[02:39:53.400 --> 02:40:02.743]  This is Brzezinski's secret base, as it was called, which is really just the names of those who were in Al Qaeda.
[02:40:03.223 --> 02:40:08.505]  That becomes the locus of the war on terror and the supposed baddies once again.
[02:40:09.145 --> 02:40:19.878]   But this interdependent order really was itself managed At the higher levels, on the basis of private banks and massive debt.
[02:40:21.299 --> 02:40:42.536]  And so if you remember back in the 2008 crisis, a lot of writers were talking, Peter Schiff, Tom Woods, people out of the, you know, the Austrian School of Economics and the people who are more libertarian minded were actually, and a lot of them were correct about how this was all scams and debt bubbles within debt bubbles within debt bubbles.
[02:40:43.553 --> 02:40:45.435]  And this was all done by design.
[02:40:45.535 --> 02:40:56.284]  So you have to understand that they will run up debt on purpose to destroy and tank the economy as a way to siphon off people's energy, right?
[02:40:56.304 --> 02:41:01.768]  Because money, in my view, is really just a symbol for energy over time and how to store energy.
[02:41:02.149 --> 02:41:08.734]  And so they will siphon off people's energy and put the nation into insurmountable debt on purpose.
[02:41:08.774 --> 02:41:11.837]  This is an actual strategy to destroy the existing system.
[02:41:12.977 --> 02:41:14.761]  And it goes by a lot of different names.
[02:41:14.781 --> 02:41:35.369]   There's a lot of different theorists, Ploward and Piven, that Alex talks about a lot, but also the Fabians had this idea too of I'm promoting anything that runs up debt and outlandish taxes because what this does is this supposedly will disrupt the corporate, in their view, the capitalist system.
[02:41:35.649 --> 02:41:38.051]  Now, it's not actually disrupting capitalism.
[02:41:38.151 --> 02:41:45.776]  It's really just fostering monopoly capitalism's oligarchical designs as they're allied with Marxist socialist collectivism.
[02:41:47.401 --> 02:41:54.487]  So he goes on to say that debt and the private banks are really the key to the new power structure and the corporations as well.
[02:41:54.507 --> 02:41:58.590]  And he says that actual warfare is very, very costly.
[02:41:59.070 --> 02:42:02.033]  So we don't really need to engage in a whole lot of actual warfare anymore.
[02:42:02.613 --> 02:42:09.519]  He says that now we're going into an age where we're going to be involved in ideological warfare and soft power.
[02:42:09.979 --> 02:42:12.121]  Now, it's true that we can still have real war, right?
[02:42:12.181 --> 02:42:14.643]  Obviously, the possibility of real war can break out.
[02:42:15.603 --> 02:42:23.148]  But what he's describing is the next several decades, right, where we didn't have, other than the war on terror, which was more of an ideological war, right?
[02:42:23.168 --> 02:42:36.876]  There wasn't a whole lot of, I mean, there was conflicts in Persian Gulf, there were conflicts in, you know, areas like Syria, but we haven't seen a full-on global war on terror the way that we saw World War II or something like that.
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:47.342]  So the Cold War, which was much more of an ideological managed conflict, was the model for the kinds of warfare that we're in now, right?
[02:42:47.382 --> 02:42:54.404]  These managed ideological conflicts, which are mass examples of soft power.
[02:42:55.464 --> 02:43:04.786]  The interconnectedness of communications, which was built as a result of the Cold War, is what will put us into a situation of an already existing proto-global government.
[02:43:05.350 --> 02:43:16.000]  These are the same people, again, who were the architects of the League of Nations, which gave way to the United Nations, which is going to give away to, you know, it may become the future world government, who knows?
[02:43:16.781 --> 02:43:19.984]  But that's always, by the way, what the Fabian socialists themselves pushed.
[02:43:20.084 --> 02:43:40.362]   They wanted, they were behind The League of Nations and the United Nations explicitly, openly, this was all at the behest of Lord Milner, the Astors and other people who, according to Quigley and the people that we talk about, literally bankrolled and funded and promoted all this through the Ivy League elite institutions and universities on the Eastern Seaboard and in the UK.
[02:43:41.823 --> 02:43:49.249]  And so you'll notice Professor Nye went and studied under these institutions and has this approach to geopolitics.
[02:43:49.864 --> 02:43:55.305]  He goes on to say that the real future will be private power and not public government power.
[02:43:55.365 --> 02:44:00.186]  Governments essentially are going to be more or less owned by the private corporate powers.
[02:44:01.006 --> 02:44:13.868]  He says that in 1953, he says, you can see an example of this kind of strategy through the CIA's ousting of Mossadegh to install the Shah.
[02:44:14.008 --> 02:44:18.529]  And by the way, this is interesting because that wasn't yet declassified as an actual CIA operation.
[02:44:19.606 --> 02:44:24.472]  Uh, at the time that Nye wrote this, but of course he assumes that people reading his writings already know this.
[02:44:25.854 --> 02:44:35.565]  So something that was called a conspiracy theory, you know, all the way up until not too many years ago, was a kind of common knowledge amongst people writing at this level, is what we should pay attention to here.
[02:44:36.488 --> 02:44:41.929]  He goes on to say, well, what are the dangers that we'll see as we come out of the Cold War and enter into this new phase?
[02:44:41.969 --> 02:44:48.271]  We're going to see rogue states, international actors that are rogue, so-called.
[02:44:48.291 --> 02:44:49.491]  We don't really know what that is.
[02:44:49.571 --> 02:44:53.612]  Basically, that's just anybody that's not involved in their debt-based banking scam.
[02:44:54.112 --> 02:44:56.812]  That's a rogue nation or a rogue individual.
[02:44:56.872 --> 02:45:04.234]  And I think we're seeing that now with the attitude of the West towards Russia, for example, that would be considered a rogue act or rogue state.
[02:45:05.228 --> 02:45:12.910]  And he says that the international corporate world will have to put in place structures that are international to combat these rogue actors.
[02:45:12.930 --> 02:45:13.430]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:45:13.470 --> 02:45:14.471]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:45:14.891 --> 02:45:15.971]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:45:15.991 --> 02:45:17.792]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[02:45:17.812 --> 02:45:22.553]  You know, I was just thinking about the products that I really enjoyed from the InfoWars store.
[02:45:22.573 --> 02:45:26.893]   I want to remind you that it's absolutely necessary to support Alex and the InfoWars
[02:45:26.893 --> 02:45:32.613]   and everybody over at InfoWars by going to the InfoWars store and loading up on those
[02:45:32.613 --> 02:45:33.613]  products right now.
[02:45:33.613 --> 02:45:39.372]   For example, the nascent iodine, I've been taking that every morning for the last, I
[02:45:39.372 --> 02:45:44.653]   don't know, about two weeks and you will immediately feel energized.
[02:45:44.653 --> 02:45:51.612]   There's like this numbness, like this, you get this, my lips get numb in a good way.
[02:45:51.612 --> 02:45:54.971]  and I'm like super energized for the next four hours.
[02:45:54.563 --> 02:46:07.330]  So I don't know what the nascent iodine actually is doing to me, but it's definitely making me, uh, it feels like, I don't know, some sort of weird superpower that is coursing through my veins.
[02:46:07.390 --> 02:46:09.771]  And I guarantee you're going to love it if you get into that.
[02:46:09.851 --> 02:46:11.732]  Also, I'm a big fan of the coral calcium.
[02:46:11.952 --> 02:46:13.733]  Um, that's, that's one of our favorites here.
[02:46:13.793 --> 02:46:14.594]  Jamie likes it too.
[02:46:15.714 --> 02:46:16.554]  So definitely get over there.
[02:46:16.955 --> 02:46:18.935]  There's a lot of books over there, too, that are great.
[02:46:18.955 --> 02:46:21.616]  A lot of DVDs, a lot of excellent T-shirts.
[02:46:22.256 --> 02:46:23.757]  So definitely support the Infowar.
[02:46:23.817 --> 02:46:24.477]  It's crucial.
[02:46:24.777 --> 02:46:26.238]  We don't want this going away.
[02:46:26.318 --> 02:46:28.919]  This is really having a huge effect.
[02:46:28.959 --> 02:46:41.483]  And just to give you an example, if we can play this clip of a Dutch politician very recently laying down the Chad Law with a bunch of globalist goons.
[02:46:41.543 --> 02:46:43.163]  I couldn't believe this when I saw it.
[02:46:44.104 --> 02:46:46.434]   If you can't Uh, see the clip.
[02:46:47.694 --> 02:46:51.336]  If you can't see the clip, uh, it's got a, I think dubbed below it.
[02:46:51.436 --> 02:46:53.017]  There's cause he's speaking in Dutch.
[02:46:53.097 --> 02:46:57.499]  Obviously I don't know Dutch, but, um, this is a YouTube clip.
[02:46:57.519 --> 02:46:58.560]  Do you guys have that?
[02:47:00.534 --> 02:47:09.334]   Whole generations of Europeans were taught by Marxists, whether they were pro-Soviet or pro-Mao.
[02:47:09.334 --> 02:47:14.254]   A good example is St. Anthony's College in Oxford, where Sigrid Kaag, her MFA,
[02:47:14.254 --> 02:47:20.054]   and he mentions that Sigrid Kaag is in fact a woman who is a Dutch politician.
[02:47:19.978 --> 02:47:28.522]  She says that this was a tool for Western secret societies, or secret services I should say, recruiting people into the global elite.
[02:47:29.422 --> 02:47:37.005]  And then the rest of the boss bitch women say, don't say this, don't talk about that, baseless conspiracy theories.
[02:47:37.025 --> 02:47:38.486]  Well it's not, it's a fact.
[02:47:38.946 --> 02:47:43.728]  So you notice that even politicians are figuring out the stuff that we talk about here.
[02:47:45.619 --> 02:47:58.350]  And this guy in total chat who just doesn't care, charges forward with pointing out how the secret intelligence service recruits people into the global elite structure from these universities.
[02:47:59.290 --> 02:48:00.091]  And what do they do?
[02:48:00.111 --> 02:48:01.092]  Do they refute him?
[02:48:01.112 --> 02:48:02.453]  No, they get up and walk out.
[02:48:03.234 --> 02:48:07.617]  So, if you're not involved in this, why are you acting guilty?
[02:48:07.637 --> 02:48:11.981]  Why are you getting up and walking out with all of her goon politicians with her?
[02:48:13.112 --> 02:48:15.774]  And then he just keeps on total chat energy.
[02:48:17.115 --> 02:48:18.216]  Not even a conspiracy theory.
[02:48:18.276 --> 02:48:25.402]  You know that this is a criminal ideology that is taught at these Western universities.
[02:48:25.462 --> 02:48:30.246]  And it's the same ideology that birthed the revolutions of the communists.
[02:48:30.967 --> 02:48:34.310]  And now it's morphed into cultural Marxism, which he's completely correct about.
[02:48:35.110 --> 02:48:37.632]  And then the whole group, they just all walk out.
[02:48:37.652 --> 02:48:39.634]  The whole cabinet gets up and walks out.
[02:48:39.774 --> 02:48:40.575]  And he calls them out.
[02:48:42.891 --> 02:48:49.335]  And he says, well, it's not an accident that she went and studied at Oxford and came back basically a Fabian socialist.
[02:48:49.775 --> 02:48:51.476]  This is everything that I've been telling you.
[02:48:51.556 --> 02:48:54.738]  And he says she was recruited for this international deep state.
[02:48:57.020 --> 02:49:01.343]  So politicians, the world over, are beginning to figure this out.
[02:49:01.723 --> 02:49:10.989]  And it's the very thing that, as we're going to close here with the rest of Nye, the very thing that Nye talked about at the global policy level.
[02:49:11.210 --> 02:49:12.490]  None of this is conspiracy.
[02:49:12.510 --> 02:49:16.973]  It's only conspiracy to get you to not think about it or talk about it.
[02:49:17.013 --> 02:49:26.780]  That's just to keep the normies and the dumbed down people from actually rubbing their two brain cells together and figuring out, hey, wait a minute, we're being scammed at an international level.
[02:49:27.780 --> 02:49:29.120]  It's not the Libs.
[02:49:29.621 --> 02:49:33.301]  It's an international, oligarchic, zillionaire elite.
[02:49:34.462 --> 02:49:40.583]  In fact, Nye goes on to say that the new threat, he's talking about the future rogue states and what?
[02:49:41.003 --> 02:49:41.983]  Global warming.
[02:49:42.043 --> 02:49:44.604]  So he goes immediately to the global warming scam.
[02:49:45.004 --> 02:49:47.244]  That will be the new international threat, he says.
[02:49:49.244 --> 02:49:55.826]  International institutions, he says, must now come up to the stage, the international stage.
[02:49:57.105 --> 02:50:03.026]  Because they must ex-world control for the information age that is emerging.
[02:50:03.066 --> 02:50:05.567]  He was writing this in 1990, predicting the information age.
[02:50:06.027 --> 02:50:09.147]  The international institutions, he says, must step to the fore.
[02:50:09.787 --> 02:50:11.288]  Remember, he mentioned cyber security.
[02:50:11.308 --> 02:50:16.549]  So he's basically predicting cyber censoring back in 1990.
[02:50:16.689 --> 02:50:23.330]  And he says that as debt increases amongst the debt, debts increase.
[02:50:23.350 --> 02:50:24.550]  Talking about the debt bubble.
[02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:35.284]  As the International Institution stepped to the fore, he says that as debt comes about and crashes the economies, he says what will be the focus is culture war.
[02:50:35.824 --> 02:50:36.805]  He says culture war.
[02:50:37.845 --> 02:50:42.788]  He says psychological operations will be crucial, right, in controlling this new global order.
[02:50:43.748 --> 02:50:47.590]  He says that it will be a battle of worldviews in the information age.
[02:50:47.790 --> 02:50:56.826]   Info war, as Alex accurately titled his site many, many years ago, again fits perfectly with what Nye is talking about.
[02:50:57.767 --> 02:51:01.450]  He says that we're going to have to have these new institutions that will police the world.
[02:51:02.111 --> 02:51:03.231]  And he says that the U.S.
[02:51:03.312 --> 02:51:11.579]  Empire will face a choice just like the British Empire faced in the 19th century, right, when it was coming and beginning to wane.
[02:51:11.619 --> 02:51:12.219]  Now the U.S.
[02:51:12.299 --> 02:51:13.320]  Empire will begin to wane.
[02:51:13.781 --> 02:51:16.823]  And what will step into the place if the U.S.
[02:51:16.923 --> 02:51:18.645]  Empire declines and collapses?
[02:51:19.502 --> 02:51:25.005]  Well, he says we're going to need an international body that steps up, something like the United Nations.
[02:51:25.525 --> 02:51:30.248]  And he says, how will they exercise and bring about this new global culture?
[02:51:30.948 --> 02:51:42.434]  UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Social, Cultural Organization, which as we know, the philosophy of UNESCO was written by Julian Huxley, a book that we've lectured through the entire text.
[02:51:43.038 --> 02:51:47.760]  Here on Alex's program and also over on my channel and on my rock fan.
[02:51:47.780 --> 02:51:52.382]  We've gone through all of these texts again, and we're doing another new one today that just backs up everything.
[02:51:52.802 --> 02:51:53.922]  How will this be brought about?
[02:51:54.122 --> 02:52:01.305]  Well, what means will UNESCO use to bring about a global culture that will destroy the existing cultures and move everybody into a global culture?
[02:52:01.925 --> 02:52:08.588]  TV shows, Hollywood, he says, will promote and create a global culture.
[02:52:09.406 --> 02:52:14.530]  That global culture will be the basis for the new international order.
[02:52:14.550 --> 02:52:21.434]  By the way, this is the exact same thing that the Fabians and the Socialists said would occur a hundred years prior to Nye writing this, right?
[02:52:21.515 --> 02:52:37.826]  They said, Shaw and others said, Bernard Shaw and others said, Milner, these people said, in the 19-teens, 20s and 30s, that debased, degenerate global sex culture, for example, not just that, but all kinds of other things, would be the basis for the new global order.
[02:52:38.487 --> 02:52:40.048]  They said that in the 20s and 30s.
[02:52:40.068 --> 02:52:44.471]  They were talking about the free love in the teens, 20s and 30s.
[02:52:45.131 --> 02:52:47.152]  The Fabian Socialists were way ahead of the time.
[02:52:49.293 --> 02:52:54.997]  And then we get this really crazy statement at the end of Nye's essay where he says, well, how are we going to combat this?
[02:52:56.117 --> 02:53:05.272]   He says that the nations as they are, the US, need to spend exorbitant amounts of money Spend, spend, spend.
[02:53:05.292 --> 02:53:06.513]  In other words, quantitative easing.
[02:53:06.873 --> 02:53:08.814]  The money printer go brr, brr, brr.
[02:53:09.074 --> 02:53:09.294]  Right?
[02:53:09.334 --> 02:53:10.554]  Make the money printer go brr.
[02:53:10.994 --> 02:53:14.275]  And then he says, uh, introduce tons of new taxes.
[02:53:17.496 --> 02:53:21.958]  So, more debt and more taxes are the answer?
[02:53:22.838 --> 02:53:23.659]  Why would that be the answer?
[02:53:23.679 --> 02:53:30.241]  Well, that's the answer if you have the design of destroying the existing system to bring in the new Great Reset Global System.
[02:53:31.701 --> 02:53:37.111]   And he says that the post-Cold War era Will bring about the new world order.
[02:53:39.493 --> 02:53:48.939]  The new challenges of the transnational interdependence, he said, will emerge out of the Cold War, which is a managed dialectic.
[02:53:50.399 --> 02:53:53.161]  Remember to support the Infowar by going to the Infowar store.
[02:53:53.201 --> 02:53:54.782]  And I don't know if you guys had my other clip.
[02:53:55.202 --> 02:53:56.723]  I made a video, music.
[02:53:56.763 --> 02:53:57.604]  It's my new single.
[02:53:57.644 --> 02:54:10.053]  I just dropped my new single where I'm mocking the soy culture, the very soft power, literally soft power soy culture that we have promoted by the elites.
[02:54:10.633 --> 02:54:11.614]  And I don't know if you have that.
[02:54:11.654 --> 02:54:13.095]  It's my Funko Pop song.
[02:54:13.535 --> 02:54:15.356]  If you want to play that, it's a banger.
[02:54:15.556 --> 02:54:17.638]  It's going to be number one on the Billboard charts.
[02:54:18.259 --> 02:54:21.469]  So, uh, is that acceptable at InfoWars?
[02:54:21.489 --> 02:54:22.713]  Can we play my song or not?
[02:54:23.555 --> 02:54:25.555]  until we go to the break.
[02:54:25.555 --> 02:54:33.795]   Well, anyway, so they don't have it ready, but you can go over to my website or go to my YouTube channel and you can
[02:54:33.795 --> 02:54:38.474]   play my Funko Pop song which again at the banger Uh, oh.
[02:54:38.490 --> 02:54:47.515]  Also, by the way, if you want to support my work, you can do so by going over to Jay's Analysis and in the shop, you'll notice I have entire lecture courses for sale there.
[02:54:47.875 --> 02:54:50.356]  I also have a new book out, actually two new books out.
[02:54:50.536 --> 02:54:53.258]  One is the giant 606 page.
[02:54:53.918 --> 02:54:55.839]  Oh, that is all of my books.
[02:54:58.763 --> 02:54:59.725]  Oh, the background.
[02:55:00.265 --> 02:55:01.367]  That's my hobbit.
[02:55:01.768 --> 02:55:02.989]  I have a hobbit.
[02:55:04.552 --> 02:55:07.536]  Ponko Pop I think was a little more appropriate.
[02:55:08.037 --> 02:55:11.702]  But if you want to get my books, you get signed copies in the shop for $45.
[02:55:11.742 --> 02:55:12.083]  Yes, I ship out.
[02:55:15.197 --> 02:55:17.638]  That's the best option.
[02:55:17.678 --> 02:55:22.260]  660 pages of all of my writings in the last 10 years, basically.
[02:55:22.520 --> 02:55:26.481]  And then I have a separate book, Meta Narratives, which has about 50 five-star reviews.
[02:55:26.501 --> 02:55:27.842]  It's been out for a couple of months.
[02:55:27.962 --> 02:55:30.823]  That's pretty hefty five-star reviews there.
[02:55:30.903 --> 02:55:34.324]  Meta Narratives, you can get that at the site as well as an introduction to philosophy.
[02:55:34.765 --> 02:55:37.285]  And a shout-out to Richard Grove over at Autonomy.
[02:55:37.305 --> 02:55:40.227]   In a couple of weeks, I'll be I wouldn't say that I'm a prideful person.
[02:55:40.287 --> 02:55:43.589]  In fact, I've gone through a lot of attacks, a lot of degradation, to tell the truth.
[02:55:43.609 --> 02:55:45.210]  But I am somebody that doesn't like to beg.
[02:55:45.029 --> 02:55:47.269]  and Hope website, so look for that.
[02:55:47.269 --> 02:55:50.069]   Follow me if you're interested in that in the next couple weeks.
[02:55:50.069 --> 02:55:59.229]  I wouldn't say that I'm a prideful person.
[02:55:59.229 --> 02:56:03.189]   In fact, I've gone through a lot of attacks, a lot of degradation to tell the truth.
[02:56:03.189 --> 02:56:06.228]  But I am somebody that doesn't like to beg.
[02:56:06.228 --> 02:56:09.269]  And I'm somebody that doesn't like to bother people.
[02:56:09.269 --> 02:56:14.109]   But you know, if I don't bother you now, if I don't push you now to fight for freedom even harder,
[02:56:15.068 --> 02:56:19.869]   we're gonna have the globalists, these control freaks, Satanists, and pedophiles
[02:56:19.869 --> 02:56:23.949]   ruling our lives and ruling the lives of our children and innocent people.
[02:56:24.796 --> 02:56:34.779]   So I can override my instinct not to beg, and my instinct not to plead, and my instinct not to be annoying, and just tell you, Who's delivered like Infowars?
[02:56:35.499 --> 02:56:38.501]  Who's had an effect against the New World Order as big as we have?
[02:56:38.521 --> 02:56:39.822]  And the answer is nobody.
[02:56:39.842 --> 02:56:44.005]  And it's because we have you, an incredible audience of activists, that have done an amazing job.
[02:56:44.565 --> 02:56:46.226]  So, so much of our mission's completed.
[02:56:46.306 --> 02:56:54.592]  I'd say 90% of the work we set out to do, exposing the New World Order, preparing folks for their attack, getting people ready to fight back, is now bearing fruit.
[02:56:54.812 --> 02:56:56.413]  We're having incredible successes everywhere.
[02:56:56.673 --> 02:57:02.897]  Nationalists, populists, anti-New World Order folks getting elected, the globalists in full panic mode, their poison shot agenda falling apart.
[02:57:03.197 --> 02:57:03.837]  Let's go on and on.
[02:57:04.718 --> 02:57:14.684]  But now we reach the critical part of the fight where the deep state is targeting all the leadership of the resistance and they see InfoWars as the very tip of the spear they want to blunt.
[02:57:15.405 --> 02:57:18.587]  So I want to ask you all to support InfoWars now more than ever.
[02:57:19.027 --> 02:57:22.990]  Now I've run some fundraisers in the past for legal defense funds for free speech at InfoWars.
[02:57:23.570 --> 02:57:25.412]  And we've got that basically paid for now.
[02:57:26.052 --> 02:57:28.214]  But courts have ruled I've got to pay my legal fees.
[02:57:28.335 --> 02:57:28.895]  I don't have the money.
[02:57:29.516 --> 02:57:30.537]  So I need your support.
[02:57:31.137 --> 02:57:38.344]  Please go to SaveInfoWars.com today and make a donation on GiveSendGo, whether it's $5, $10, or $100, so that I personally continue to battle.
[02:57:41.747 --> 02:57:44.709]  We're so close to victory, but I know this, we're not giving up.
[02:57:45.069 --> 02:57:46.470]  So please help me not give up.

[02:57:55.415 --> 02:57:55.756]  Thank you.
[02:57:55.996 --> 02:57:58.677]  You've been encouraging your audience to give you money, right?
[02:58:00.078 --> 02:58:00.879]  Yes, like media.
[02:58:00.959 --> 02:58:02.660]  I raise money to stay on air.
[02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:11.502]   And the most recent website you've been encouraging your audience to donate at is 1776coin.com, right?
[02:58:13.142 --> 02:58:17.285]  Well, it's where you can buy silver coins.
[02:58:17.625 --> 02:58:19.386]  1776coin.com is the website, right?
[02:58:19.826 --> 02:58:20.086]  Yes.
[02:58:20.406 --> 02:58:24.148]  It's the fourth coin that we've released in the last year.
[02:58:24.869 --> 02:58:26.049]  And I believe the most powerful.
[02:58:26.490 --> 02:58:29.551]  The man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[02:58:31.092 --> 02:58:32.493]  Citizen of a republic.
[02:58:33.641 --> 02:58:34.541]  Man in the arena.
[02:58:35.101 --> 02:58:37.122]  There's only 10,000 of this coin.
[02:58:37.462 --> 02:58:38.482]  It exists in the world.
[02:58:38.923 --> 02:58:40.503]  It will never be made again.
[02:58:40.523 --> 02:58:43.124]  It's not just an amazing historic coin.
[02:58:43.544 --> 02:58:46.785]  It funds the information war against the globalists.
[02:58:47.125 --> 02:58:49.306]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren.
[02:58:49.666 --> 02:58:50.886]  This is something you want to own.
[02:58:51.386 --> 02:58:56.608]  And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war against the globalists.
[02:58:57.168 --> 02:58:59.509]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available.
[02:58:59.549 --> 02:59:00.569]  They'll sell out very quickly.
[02:59:01.269 --> 02:59:03.970]  Please be part of history, and thank you all for your support.
[02:59:04.790 --> 02:59:11.132]  You can go to 1776coin.com, or you can go to patriotcollectibles.com and secure this coin.
[02:59:11.412 --> 02:59:15.794]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence, and it funds the Infowar.
[02:59:16.494 --> 02:59:18.195]  Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[02:59:18.715 --> 02:59:19.015]  1776coin.com.
[02:59:19.095 --> 02:59:20.315]  Anyway, back to this coin.
[02:59:20.495 --> 02:59:24.597]  This is what you've been asking your audience to give you money for this week, right?
[02:59:25.697 --> 02:59:28.338]  We actually started making these coins six months ago.
[02:59:29.397 --> 02:59:38.159]  But what you're running right now, this week, is you've been talking about this trial, after you said that you're sending them to 1776coin.com, right?
[02:59:38.399 --> 02:59:45.760]  Yes, that's where we sell the collectible coins for people that want to keep the show on the air.
[02:59:46.180 --> 02:59:46.841]  Okay.
[02:59:46.981 --> 02:59:50.721]  And did you tell Brittany Paz about that revenue platform?
[02:59:52.122 --> 02:59:53.282]  We advertised it on air, yeah.
