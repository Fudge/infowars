[00:00.000 --> 00:15.440]  It's Tuesday, honest and true, from here on out, as you found it, attempt to speak.
[00:15.440 --> 00:24.320]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:24.320 --> 00:33.240]  Russia has made its most direct and chilling statements yet concerning the fact that they
[00:33.240 --> 00:40.480]  may engage in direct military confrontation with the United States and NATO.
[00:40.480 --> 00:44.520]  Story is on Infowars.com.
[00:44.520 --> 00:49.320]  Another report by Paul Joseph Watson with other similar quotes out of the Russian government.
[00:49.320 --> 00:55.720]  Nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia would wipe out at least five billion people.
[00:55.720 --> 01:00.720]  Two-thirds would die from the starvation of the destruction of industrial society, but
[01:00.720 --> 01:06.360]  the globalists are already shutting down our industrial society as well.
[01:06.360 --> 01:15.920]  Yovall, Noah Yovall Harari, the chaplain of the Deboast Group, their spiritual leader
[01:15.920 --> 01:19.640]  has come out and said we don't need the majority of humans.
[01:19.640 --> 01:25.780]  In fact, I'm going to play just a short segment of him, it's audio only, recorded inside a
[01:25.780 --> 01:31.240]  TED talk just a few days ago, and we'll go to break and come back with all the huge news
[01:31.240 --> 01:35.880]  today, but here they are telling you that you're obsolete, that you're non-essential.
[01:35.880 --> 01:36.880]  Here he is.
[01:36.880 --> 01:45.080]  But I think part of what is going on on maybe a deeper level of the human mind is that people
[01:45.080 --> 01:54.720]  sense, a lot of people sense that they are being left behind and left out of the story,
[01:54.720 --> 01:59.080]  even if their material conditions are still relatively good.
[01:59.080 --> 02:04.080]  In the 20th century, what was common to all the stories, the liberal, the fascist, the
[02:04.080 --> 02:09.960]  communist, is that the big heroes of the story were the common people.
[02:09.960 --> 02:15.000]  Not necessarily all people, but if you lived, say, I don't know, in the Soviet Union, in
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.760]  the 1930s, life was very grim.
[02:18.760 --> 02:26.240]  But when you looked at the propaganda posters on the walls that depicted the glorious future,
[02:26.240 --> 02:27.680]  you were there.
[02:27.680 --> 02:37.080]  You looked at the posters which showed steelworkers and farmers in heroic poses, and it was obvious
[02:37.080 --> 02:40.200]  that this is the future.
[02:40.200 --> 02:46.680]  Now when people look at the posters on the walls or listen to TED Talks, they hear a
[02:46.680 --> 02:53.960]  lot of these big ideas and big words about machine learning and genetic engineering and
[02:53.960 --> 02:59.840]  blockchain and globalization, and they are not there.
[02:59.840 --> 03:04.360]  They are no longer part of the story of the future.
[03:04.360 --> 03:11.640]  And I think that if I, again, this is an hypothesis, if I try to understand and to connect to the
[03:11.640 --> 03:19.040]  deep resentment of people in many places around the world, part of what might be going there
[03:19.040 --> 03:26.280]  is people, and they are correct in thinking that, that the future doesn't need me.
[03:26.280 --> 03:32.440]  You have all these smart people in California and in New York and in Beijing, and they are
[03:32.440 --> 03:38.320]  planning this amazing future with artificial intelligence and bioengineering and global
[03:38.320 --> 03:42.240]  connectivity and whatnot, and they don't need me.
[03:42.240 --> 03:48.520]  So maybe if they are nice, they will throw some crumbs my way like universal basic income.
[03:48.520 --> 03:55.840]  But it's much worse psychologically to feel that you are useless than to feel that you
[03:55.840 --> 03:56.840]  are exploited.
[03:56.840 --> 04:02.000]  So talk about this, because this is one of the key ideas that you have been extremely
[04:02.000 --> 04:03.440]  articulate about.
[04:03.440 --> 04:09.400]  Talk about how you see technology shifting, how things work, and actually realizing those
[04:09.400 --> 04:14.920]  fears or risking realizing those fears even more deeply than you think people feel.
[04:14.920 --> 04:19.840]  So on one level, you know, it's the economic and military realities.
[04:19.840 --> 04:25.120]  If you go back to the middle of the 20th century, and it doesn't matter if you're in the United
[04:25.120 --> 04:30.400]  States with Roosevelt, or if you're in Germany with Hitler, or if you're in the USSR with
[04:30.400 --> 04:31.400]  Stalin.
[04:31.400 --> 04:37.120]  And you think about building the future, then your building materials are those millions
[04:37.120 --> 04:44.560]  of people who are working hard in the factories, in the farms, the soldiers in the, you need
[04:44.560 --> 04:45.560]  them.
[04:45.560 --> 04:49.400]  You don't have any kind of future without them.
[04:49.400 --> 04:56.880]  And now fast forward to the early 21st century, when we just don't need the vast majority
[04:56.880 --> 05:01.280]  of the population.
[05:01.280 --> 05:06.400]  So many people over the years have walked up to me randomly on the street and said,
[05:06.400 --> 05:09.160]  super male vitality is incredible.
[05:09.160 --> 05:10.160]  Why does it work so well?
[05:10.160 --> 05:12.440]  And the answer is very simple.
[05:12.440 --> 05:18.200]  It takes from Chinese medicine and other ancient traditions, known herbal compounds that boosts
[05:18.200 --> 05:24.920]  libido, stamina, and energy, and it comes from cold pressed herbs, so they're not boiling
[05:24.920 --> 05:29.320]  or heating up the herbs that are known to have these natural effects.
[05:29.320 --> 05:31.400]  It's cold pressed.
[05:31.400 --> 05:34.160]  It's been sold out for eight months or more.
[05:34.160 --> 05:41.280]  It's finally back in stock at infowarstore.com for 25% off super male vitality, and it goes
[05:41.280 --> 05:44.880]  great with X2, which is also 25% off.
[05:44.880 --> 05:51.080]  But if you get both these products together, they're 40% off in a combo at infowarstore.com.
[05:51.080 --> 05:59.240]  So X2 and super male vitality, 40% off together, or 25% off individually at infowarstore.com.
[05:59.240 --> 06:17.440]  It's amazing try today.
[06:17.440 --> 06:21.720]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:21.720 --> 06:34.160]  Live from the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:34.160 --> 06:40.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this August 16th, Tuesday, World Wide Transmission.
[06:40.160 --> 06:41.560]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:41.560 --> 06:43.840]  We have several big guests today.
[06:43.840 --> 06:47.640]  Roger Stone's going to be responding to latest developments with another special guest he's
[06:47.640 --> 06:57.440]  going to have joining us with our logo raid that is blown up in the establishment's face.
[06:57.440 --> 07:01.720]  We are going to be looking at the huge announcements by Russia threatening nuclear war and direct
[07:01.720 --> 07:04.080]  clash with the United States.
[07:04.080 --> 07:09.400]  What experts are laying out there, we've got big developments on the move to confuse our
[07:09.400 --> 07:16.480]  children and have the state take over the direction of their reproductive lives and how humanity
[07:16.480 --> 07:20.560]  is waking up and fighting back against that.
[07:20.560 --> 07:27.600]  We have so much that we're going to be laying out and breaking down here today.
[07:27.600 --> 07:34.760]  I also intend to open the phones up.
[07:34.760 --> 07:39.680]  What I think is best for me to do right now is to simply read to you some of the headlines
[07:39.680 --> 07:43.080]  that we'll drill back into these in more details.
[07:43.080 --> 07:47.640]  Special warns of direct clash with the U.S. Nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia could
[07:47.640 --> 07:52.280]  wipe out five billion people.
[07:52.280 --> 07:58.440]  Over a dozen FBI whistleblowers have come to Congressman Jordan after raid on Marlago.
[07:58.440 --> 08:04.600]  DOJ begs judge to keep the details of the Marlago raid secret.
[08:04.600 --> 08:11.200]  Biden's DOJ opposes release of underlying epidemic for FBI Marlago raid.
[08:11.200 --> 08:16.320]  Roger Stone responds to Marlago raid, an FBI seizure of his pardon documents, that's up
[08:16.320 --> 08:17.320]  on infowars.com.
[08:17.320 --> 08:21.080]  They also seized Trump's passports.
[08:21.080 --> 08:25.200]  The attempt to prosecute Donald Trump is unleashing more than our political system can handle
[08:25.200 --> 08:28.320]  and threatens civil war.
[08:28.320 --> 08:31.000]  And it goes on and on and on.
[08:31.000 --> 08:32.000]  We don't believe you.
[08:32.000 --> 08:39.960]  Mises Institute, president rips establishment GOP's response to the raid.
[08:39.960 --> 08:43.240]  The FBI taught us anything this week.
[08:43.240 --> 08:49.560]  It's that no one is above the law, unless they're crossing the border illegally, leading 33,000
[08:49.560 --> 08:56.160]  classified emails are rioting their way to two billion in damages and 42 deaths, mostly
[08:56.160 --> 08:58.440]  peaceful protests.
[08:58.440 --> 09:02.560]  Normie Law professor started his tweets, had the best take on Marlago raid.
[09:02.560 --> 09:05.680]  Democrats never accept that Trump was the president.
[09:05.680 --> 09:10.320]  He was seen more classified information than all but a few living people.
[09:10.320 --> 09:14.960]  But they can't accept Trump was the president, so it just feels wrong for him to have the
[09:14.960 --> 09:18.720]  documents, even though Obama does as well.
[09:18.720 --> 09:22.000]  Media again takes a big hit after they had to return Trump's passports, I guess those
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.160]  are nuclear secrets too.
[09:25.160 --> 09:29.520]  Trump sends a cryptic message to Merrick Garland before warrant was unsealed.
[09:29.520 --> 09:30.680]  The country's on fire.
[09:30.680 --> 09:32.560]  What can I do to reduce the heat?
[09:32.560 --> 09:34.560]  They called that a threat.
[09:34.560 --> 09:39.360]  Meanwhile, the daily visas to headline Americans are too pampered and neurotic to fight a civil
[09:39.360 --> 09:44.320]  war, even though there is a civil war being directed by the left against free humanity.
[09:44.320 --> 09:49.400]  Now let's get into these key stacks of news.
[09:49.400 --> 09:54.280]  Boston Children's Hospital, children know their trends the minute they're born and the hospital
[09:54.280 --> 09:58.040]  will make the designation and then basically take their lives over making sure they get
[09:58.040 --> 09:59.560]  sterilized later.
[09:59.560 --> 10:00.560]  What a cult.
[10:00.560 --> 10:02.000]  The people are fighting back.
[10:02.000 --> 10:07.240]  London sex change clinic for kids shut down and sued by 1,000 families.
[10:07.240 --> 10:12.440]  Where it all started, the Tabistock Institute, we're going to be drilling into this.
[10:12.440 --> 10:17.400]  Roll Tide, University of Alabama, sororities, unanimously reject membership for transgender
[10:17.400 --> 10:19.920]  applicants.
[10:19.920 --> 10:24.600]  Major news scientific study, left-leaning men are more conservative after testosterone
[10:24.600 --> 10:25.600]  boosting.
[10:25.600 --> 10:33.280]  And here's the study, we'll actually be getting into that some today.
[10:33.280 --> 10:39.400]  Then it continues into this key stack, Minneapolis teachers union contract calls for layoffs of
[10:39.400 --> 10:42.080]  white teachers.
[10:42.080 --> 10:48.480]  Minneapolis teachers union demands white teachers get fired first.
[10:48.480 --> 10:55.000]  That is simply incredible, but the next level of his takeover we have all of those actual
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.000]  documents.
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.520]  Then we've got this incredible stack.
[10:59.520 --> 11:07.120]  We just don't need the vast majority of the population, top W.E.F. advisor Harari.
[11:07.120 --> 11:10.880]  Germany could face power grid collapse due to soaring demand for electric heaters, but
[11:10.880 --> 11:14.120]  they've got an answer, wait till you hear what the answer is.
[11:14.120 --> 11:18.360]  Robot control of all devices in your house, smart meters, told you that was coming 20 years
[11:18.360 --> 11:20.600]  ago because it was in their plans.
[11:20.600 --> 11:24.520]  Study claims more kids are fat because of global warming, not because of sedentary
[11:24.520 --> 11:26.120]  lifestyles.
[11:26.120 --> 11:30.200]  And you will eat the bugs, they're officially rolling out all over the west, from England
[11:30.200 --> 11:34.960]  to the U.S. to Germany, cricket, protein powder, and in some stores that's all they
[11:34.960 --> 11:37.920]  say will be available, slipping the bugs in.
[11:37.920 --> 11:43.960]  You will eat the bugs, major brands quietly slip insects into your food.
[11:43.960 --> 11:47.600]  That is all coming up here today.
[11:47.600 --> 11:51.720]  More on the economy, on what inflation is really doing, J.P. Morgan says something a
[11:51.720 --> 11:57.600]  lot bigger than recession is coming, that is a critical stack.
[11:57.600 --> 12:04.360]  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is just one small portion of what I will cover each article
[12:04.360 --> 12:07.520]  in some detail today.
[12:07.520 --> 12:13.680]  We have Liz Cheney facing her reckoning tonight with the primary that she's sure to lose,
[12:13.680 --> 12:17.680]  polls show she'll probably lose by 50%, but with election fraud, who knows, they may
[12:17.680 --> 12:21.680]  give her 100% of the vote, but all the numbers on the street evidence shows massive loss
[12:21.680 --> 12:22.680]  for herb.
[12:22.680 --> 12:25.760]  And we're going to be getting into this stack that I told you yesterday I would be getting
[12:25.760 --> 12:26.760]  into.
[12:26.760 --> 12:30.800]  More and more major insurance companies confirming what we can already see from the death statistic
[12:30.800 --> 12:37.400]  numbers from the U.K., the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union.
[12:37.400 --> 12:46.760]  Massive, massive multi-thousand percent increases in deaths between the age of 18 and 63, quote,
[12:46.760 --> 12:53.600]  working age, and even higher increases in people six and up who are starting to take
[12:53.600 --> 12:57.760]  the shots and those 64 and older.
[12:57.760 --> 13:01.200]  And then we have all the different funeral directors all over the world saying it's incredible.
[13:01.200 --> 13:04.880]  The number of deaths has just exploded.
[13:04.880 --> 13:08.240]  People go out to cemeteries where their families buried, where you normally see five, six new
[13:08.240 --> 13:16.360]  graves a year at small cemeteries, they'll be, you know, 95, 92, it's all around you.
[13:16.360 --> 13:21.240]  That's really the big issue is they rolled out the soft kill weapon in front of everybody
[13:21.240 --> 13:26.000]  to test and see if they can get away with it.
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.640]  It's all coming up and so much more today.
[13:30.640 --> 13:35.840]  Now before we go any further, the corporate media is continuing to run with fake headlines
[13:35.840 --> 13:44.520]  that I have $400 million, I have $150 million, I make $60 million, none of it is true, it's
[13:44.520 --> 13:50.640]  all lies and they're doing that because they don't want us to be able to appeal these kangaroo
[13:50.640 --> 13:53.480]  court judgments and they don't want us to stay on air.
[13:53.480 --> 13:57.680]  They've said their goal is to silence us first so they can, quote, silence you.
[13:57.680 --> 14:00.960]  Take away our platform, quote, take us out.
[14:00.960 --> 14:05.800]  They don't want money that are being financed obviously by the big billionaire club of globalist.
[14:05.800 --> 14:12.840]  The usual suspects, the Bloombergs, the Soros, the Bill Gates of the world are heavily out
[14:12.840 --> 14:17.080]  there publicly and behind the scenes working to silence all of us.
[14:17.080 --> 14:20.400]  That's why it's critical to take the live show feed from infowars.com forward slash
[14:20.400 --> 14:23.960]  show and band up video and share it on your email, your text messages by word of mouth

[14:28.040 --> 14:31.960]  see what he's really saying and why the establishment is so scared.

[20:30.280 --> 20:36.600]  going on in the world what on earth really is going on well that's what we try to do here

[20:47.400 --> 20:54.520]  team satan thank you again for joining us on this live tuesday broadcast you know i was about to get
[20:54.520 --> 20:58.360]  into the fbi raid and all the big developments there and play some key clips and i'm going to do
[20:58.360 --> 21:05.080]  that next segment but really this is the biggest news the situation with russia and the deterioration
[21:05.080 --> 21:08.840]  and that proxy war in ukraine i'm going to get to that in a moment but first i want to just say
[21:08.840 --> 21:13.960]  something about where our country in the world itself is right now i've had really countless
[21:13.960 --> 21:19.400]  people on the street and people that i personally know and friends and family and old friends i haven't
[21:19.400 --> 21:27.480]  heard from in years call me and text message me and reach out and say man how are you handling
[21:27.480 --> 21:34.200]  all these attacks how are you handling all of this incredible demonization how are you doing it
[21:35.240 --> 21:42.920]  and i tell them i say i'm really handling it quite well the least of my problems are corrupt
[21:42.920 --> 21:49.080]  rig courts and groups that want to take me off the air that's a bad thing but on a scale of one to
[21:49.080 --> 21:55.960]  ten it's about a two russia being in an open war with the united states and nato that george
[21:55.960 --> 22:02.760]  sorrell started global food shortages 65 plus million or four million people they estimated
[22:02.760 --> 22:07.320]  months ago have starved to death from the global lockdowns extra on top of the normal
[22:07.320 --> 22:12.680]  15 million a year of the starved to death they're preparing new lockdowns new forced inoculations
[22:13.320 --> 22:20.680]  it's confirmed everywhere by mainline government reports and pentagon reports and pathology
[22:20.680 --> 22:27.320]  association reports of germany and major insurance company actuaries that what in the hell is going
[22:27.320 --> 22:34.200]  on why are there so many mass excess deaths we had experts on two years ago when this all started
[22:34.200 --> 22:40.360]  saying they were already seeing it who had actually predicted it people like the former head scientist
[22:40.360 --> 22:49.480]  advisor went public michael yedon but now we're living in it and we know it's happening so to my
[22:49.480 --> 22:54.520]  enemies out there they're trying to grind me down and break me down and and and make me give up
[22:55.640 --> 23:02.280]  you don't even show up on the Richter scale but i will be honest with the audience and i know you're
[23:02.280 --> 23:11.320]  in the same boat i am spiritually exhausted i am extremely wounded and i am so sad for humanity
[23:12.120 --> 23:16.680]  watching our fellow men women and children die from these injections and die from the bio weapon
[23:16.680 --> 23:21.000]  they released at wuhan and to know that it was only a beta test and the real attacks coming
[23:21.000 --> 23:35.720]  i am extremely upset and i am extremely torn and i'm not normally a torn person i am very decisive
[23:35.720 --> 23:40.840]  of course torn means you don't know what to do you're you're pulled in different directions
[23:43.160 --> 23:46.680]  i really love my children and i really love my family
[23:46.680 --> 23:53.000]  and i love my extended family and i think of this crew as my extended family
[23:54.360 --> 24:00.440]  i even worry about my ex-wife even though she hates my guts and has been turned over to a
[24:00.440 --> 24:08.120]  total spirit of the left because i understand that they are people like her captured victims
[24:08.120 --> 24:19.480]  of this spiritual harass but i am torn because i know that we've just been teed up for the real
[24:19.480 --> 24:25.240]  attack and the new rewarders telling us it's coming power outages cyber attacks mass starvation
[24:25.240 --> 24:30.120]  total collapse they say it's global warming we know it's them as the technocrats that actually
[24:30.120 --> 24:36.520]  control the levers of civilization that are doing this and so far they've just been testing our
[24:36.520 --> 24:48.280]  response as we go from beta into operations and so i am probably in the next few days going to
[24:48.280 --> 24:56.360]  take a week off and i'm not going to do a workcation and i'm not going to do what i normally do when
[24:56.360 --> 25:03.080]  i take off i'm going to take off and probably turn everything off and probably fast a couple days
[25:03.080 --> 25:10.840]  and exercise a lot and just try to meditate and decide what i should do because when i say i'm
[25:10.840 --> 25:18.040]  torn i'm not going to stop this show but i physically at a cellular level at a gut level
[25:19.160 --> 25:28.680]  know that i am facing annihilation and you are facing annihilation i can feel it i can see it
[25:28.680 --> 25:38.680]  i can taste it i can smell it and the level of danger is so intense it's probably
[25:40.760 --> 25:46.360]  a hundred times any level of danger i've ever felt and what happens is the brain is the
[25:46.360 --> 25:49.480]  subconscious mind is thousands of times more powerful than the conscious mind
[25:51.080 --> 25:56.360]  and it knows it can see all the information even a dumb person is actually a genius if their
[25:56.360 --> 26:00.600]  subconscious was fully connected to their consciousness they were fully conscious of its
[26:03.160 --> 26:14.040]  intricate systems and so all i'm getting at is that we're in grave danger you're in grave danger
[26:15.000 --> 26:22.200]  and that this whole decadent facade is being swept away by design and the fools
[26:22.200 --> 26:27.560]  that have gone along with it have no idea how much grave danger they're in they believe when the
[26:27.560 --> 26:33.160]  control collapse of the great reset that they're going to be in charge at the end of this when
[26:33.160 --> 26:40.920]  they're not going to be alive at the end of this and so i really think at the end of the day i can
[26:40.920 --> 26:46.040]  sit here and read all these articles and cover all this news and i will but i think the most
[26:46.040 --> 26:51.320]  important thing to do is just get right with god and really think about your spirit and your life
[26:51.320 --> 26:57.560]  and your family and what you stand for and then really count the cost and decide what is it you're
[26:57.560 --> 27:02.200]  going to do to yourselves get prepared because you gotta take care of yourself first so you can
[27:02.200 --> 27:08.280]  then take care of others and then what is it we're all going to do to stand against this evil and to
[27:08.280 --> 27:15.880]  be the paul reveres that god wants us to be to raise the alarm is watch men and watch women on the
[27:15.880 --> 27:24.840]  wall and that's really my message and i don't think you need me to tell you how dire the
[27:24.840 --> 27:34.120]  straights are and i've tried my best i can hold my head high and be thankful that we were visionaries
[27:34.120 --> 27:41.880]  that knew this was coming but that's really not a consolation when we understand that it doesn't
[27:41.880 --> 27:47.000]  really matter at the end of the day if we don't mitigate what we're going into and we will mitigate
[27:47.000 --> 27:51.880]  it and humanity's got a fighting chance because of what you've done is listeners this broadcast
[27:51.880 --> 27:55.800]  and what countless others have done out there as well and i can tell you there's a lot of really
[27:55.800 --> 28:05.800]  positive things to talk about as well i am just anywhere i go in the country mobbed absolutely
[28:05.800 --> 28:16.840]  mobbed by supporters i mean it's insane i am also not mobbed but for every 10 hands i shake
[28:16.840 --> 28:21.960]  i get an f u i hope you die or the worst person on earth and people get in my face and try to
[28:21.960 --> 28:28.360]  physically assault me in some cases and they'll sneak up on you in restaurants and start screaming
[28:28.360 --> 28:37.400]  start screaming at you in your ears and stuff like that and again i'm not even mad at these people
[28:38.120 --> 28:42.680]  but because sometimes they startle me i've got to consciously be conscious it can happen any second
[28:43.560 --> 28:50.920]  or i'll respond back the way they want me to and then that only contributes to the problems
[28:50.920 --> 28:55.480]  i will talk about russia's openly threatening nuclear war and saying they've taken their
[28:55.480 --> 29:05.640]  safeties off great head sold out for more than a year and a half because of supply chain breakdowns

[33:50.680 --> 33:55.320]  we have returned thank you so much for tuning into this tuesday that should have all shown so
[33:55.320 --> 33:59.480]  let me finish the point i was making before the break because i meant to make it and i didn't
[33:59.480 --> 34:05.480]  really make it i want to put a bow on it and move on to the big news here and then your phone calls
[34:05.480 --> 34:17.080]  and so much more today i am torn because as a father i want to protect my family and i know
[34:17.080 --> 34:21.880]  that by fighting the globalist at point blank range with everything i've got and being a populist
[34:21.880 --> 34:30.280]  fulcrum and beachhead that it only makes my family that much more of a target
[34:32.200 --> 34:39.560]  but you see that's the trick if you're scared of criticism and attacks and if you roll over
[34:39.560 --> 34:47.880]  to bullies and tyrants and criminals and thugs and goons then you're going to guarantee that
[34:47.880 --> 34:54.600]  you and your family are slaves or even killed but if you take them head on historically
[34:56.200 --> 35:03.240]  that's how you build thriving beautiful strong affluent civilizations with justice and security
[35:03.240 --> 35:11.800]  and peace and so i'm extremely honored to do that at a spiritual level and also at the front of my
[35:11.800 --> 35:21.720]  cerebral cortex in my intention but my flesh is weak and my flesh doesn't want to focus on the
[35:21.720 --> 35:27.720]  problems doesn't want to take on the responsibilities and also just wants to get my family and go to
[35:27.720 --> 35:35.000]  the middle of nowhere and be a farmer that's who my ancestors were that's who most of your
[35:35.000 --> 35:40.360]  ancestors were and that's really what i like to do i like to get up at 4 a.m i like to eat breakfast
[35:40.360 --> 35:48.120]  i like to go out and do work and i like to be done by noon and then go visit family and hang out
[35:48.120 --> 35:58.600]  and do stuff till about four o'clock go back and work a couple more hours eat dinner maybe play some
[35:58.600 --> 36:05.320]  cards and then go back out and do some work once the sun starts going down
[36:05.320 --> 36:15.000]  and that's really what i want to do you know i can't do that i get high out the woods
[36:15.960 --> 36:26.600]  off nature i get high working in a field i get high splitting wood or fishing i get high looking
[36:26.600 --> 36:37.160]  at the stars but instead i gotta look at merit garland claus swab and i'll do it
[36:39.320 --> 36:42.760]  and i gotta study all the evil crap they do and i gotta watch them kill our people
[36:43.880 --> 36:47.640]  and i gotta watch them try to brainwash and destroy our children's futures
[36:48.840 --> 36:55.480]  and i'm not a victim and i'm not complaining i'm simply telling you out there that i know
[36:55.480 --> 37:01.480]  why you don't want to engage these people and i know why sometimes you want to tune out and i'm
[37:01.480 --> 37:09.480]  right there with you but the children are under attack and god's watching and i'm going to tell
[37:09.480 --> 37:13.400]  you right now and you know this deep in your gut deep in your soul you don't need me to tell you
[37:13.400 --> 37:19.000]  but i'm going to tell you just in case you've been ignoring your spirit god's going to cut us off if
[37:19.000 --> 37:25.560]  we don't take these evil people on the children that are in bondage and enslavement and pain
[37:25.560 --> 37:32.840]  around the world are crying out to god to deliver them and god works through us
[37:35.160 --> 37:39.960]  and if we ignore the cries of the children and the prayers of the children
[37:39.960 --> 37:51.160]  and if we deny the holy spirit's directions god is going to allow us to be destroyed
[37:52.840 --> 37:58.440]  and now let's hit these new articles this is directly from the russians russia today
[38:00.280 --> 38:04.040]  russia warns of direct clash with the us and has been warning for months
[38:04.040 --> 38:10.120]  as the people running the us pour tens of millions of dollars every few months of weapons
[38:10.680 --> 38:15.240]  into ukraine in the proxy war that george soros brags he started eight and a half years ago
[38:17.240 --> 38:21.880]  washington's behavior on the world stage risk direct conflict between nuclear states the russian
[38:21.880 --> 38:31.160]  embassy in the us is warned today the united states continues to act with no regard to other
[38:31.160 --> 38:38.200]  countries security and interest which contributes to an increase in nuclear risk the embassy said
[38:38.200 --> 38:47.800]  in a statement on its telegram channel the us steps to further engage in a hybrid confrontation
[38:49.240 --> 38:53.880]  with russia in the context of the ukrainian crisis are fraught with unprecedented
[38:54.440 --> 39:01.080]  unpredictable escalation and a direct military clash of nuclear powers close quote the embassy
[39:01.080 --> 39:07.800]  noted that washington has recently withdrawn from two key arms control agreements 1987 intermediate
[39:07.800 --> 39:13.320]  range nuclear forces treaty which banned certain classes of land-based missiles the 1992 treaty on
[39:13.320 --> 39:18.680]  open skies which allowed for surveillance flights over each other's territories the embassy urged
[39:18.680 --> 39:25.320]  the us to take a quote closer look at its own nuclear policy instead of making unfounded accusations
[39:25.320 --> 39:31.480]  against the countries whose worldviews do not coincide with american ones you hear american ones
[39:31.480 --> 39:37.720]  you mean globalist our country faithful fulfills its obligations as a nuclear weapon state and
[39:37.720 --> 39:41.800]  makes every effort to reduce nuclear risk the diplomat said the statement comes out with the
[39:41.800 --> 39:49.320]  us accused moscow of using the nuclear power plant in southern ukraine as cover for its soldiers
[39:49.880 --> 39:53.000]  the plant the largest in europe was seized by russian troops during the early stages of
[39:53.000 --> 39:58.520]  moscow's military operations ukraine which was launched in late february it controls and operates
[39:58.520 --> 40:06.520]  the ukraine personnel under russian control that story is on info wars dot com i suggest you read
[40:06.520 --> 40:13.080]  the rest of it here's another one by paul joseph watson along the very same parallel nuclear war
[40:13.080 --> 40:18.600]  between the us and russia would wipe out five million people i think that's a very conservative
[40:18.600 --> 40:24.600]  number because if the major cities and infrastructure get destroyed the way civilization set up nine
[40:24.600 --> 40:28.760]  out of ten people live in a city of the ten percent that are rural less than half are
[40:28.760 --> 40:34.840]  self-sufficient five percent cannot take care of the 30 or 40 percent of people that are left
[40:34.840 --> 40:39.720]  after a nuclear war even the major strike zones i think you can imagine what that'll look like
[40:39.720 --> 40:47.720]  zombie apocalypse would blush at what this will look like a new study has found that nuclear war
[40:47.720 --> 40:51.720]  between the united states and russia would cause two-thirds the planet to starve to death within
[40:51.720 --> 40:59.400]  two years the dire prognosis which explained in modeling by ruggers university which found that
[40:59.400 --> 41:04.200]  five billion people would perish primarily as a result of nuclear detonations causing huge
[41:04.200 --> 41:09.560]  infernos that inject soot into the atmosphere which blocks out the sun devastating crops
[41:10.440 --> 41:15.960]  even a small nuclear skirmish says between india and pakistan would likely lead to 2.5 million deaths
[41:15.960 --> 41:20.360]  within 24 months reports the telegraph the investigation found that in the event of a
[41:20.360 --> 41:24.920]  full large-scale nuclear confrontation between us and russia food production based on total
[41:24.920 --> 41:31.320]  calorie content would reduce 90 within three to four years of the conflict the team found that the
[41:31.320 --> 41:37.240]  outcome could be even worse given that they didn't even include heating of the stratosphere which
[41:37.240 --> 41:42.280]  would destroy the ozone layer and allow ultraviolent radiation to damage the surface of the planet
[41:42.280 --> 41:48.040]  including crops the data tell us one thing we must prevent nuclear war remember happening said
[41:48.040 --> 41:52.280]  alan robach distinguished professor of climate science in the department of environmental
[41:52.280 --> 41:57.400]  sciences at ruggers world has come closer nuclear war several times batting nuclear weapons is the
[41:57.400 --> 42:02.200]  only long-term solution he added as we highlighted last month the new york city emergency management
[42:02.200 --> 42:06.920]  department released a psa instructing residents what to do in the event of a nuclear attack like
[42:06.920 --> 42:11.720]  tuning in to the local radio which will be off the air and the internet which will be off the first
[42:11.720 --> 42:16.840]  of its kind since the late 60s a poll conducted at the invasion of ukraine found that eight out of
[42:16.840 --> 42:23.240]  ten americans were worried biden's response could lead to nuclear war the article goes on from there
[42:26.600 --> 42:33.080]  we're closer to nuclear war than we've ever been but i believe the globalist before that happens
[42:33.080 --> 42:38.120]  they're going to do a major cyberattack i've seen their pre-programming and brainwashing and claimed
[42:38.120 --> 42:44.360]  that some rogue terror group did it or the russians all i can tell you is my spider sense
[42:45.160 --> 42:51.480]  it has never been this intense on a scale of one to ten it's five thousand it's broken the gauge

[45:58.440 --> 46:04.200]  him quite often now the great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government
[46:04.200 --> 46:09.800]  doesn't want you to read that most of the big powerful companies trying to control your life the
[46:09.800 --> 46:15.320]  big tech companies they don't want you to read this book they want to control what you think what
[46:15.320 --> 46:20.680]  you do what you read but you don't want that and alex jones doesn't want that and this book
[46:20.680 --> 46:26.280]  shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it and so by
[46:26.280 --> 46:31.240]  buying this book you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work that freedom is alive in

[46:37.240 --> 46:42.680]  censorship kicks in it's not going to be available in bookstores it's not going to be available in
[46:42.680 --> 46:47.400]  libraries they're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can but they're not
[46:47.400 --> 46:52.600]  going to be able to do it prove that censorship doesn't work by the great reset thank you alex
[46:52.600 --> 46:57.240]  jones i really appreciate you having me on and i appreciate you writing this book and getting
[46:57.240 --> 47:06.120]  the information out there leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[47:06.120 --> 47:18.760]  foreign and domestic
[47:19.960 --> 47:27.320]  surging with human resistance empowered by god waging war on the new world order
[47:27.320 --> 47:37.320]  crashing the lies and disinformation thank you for joining us on this Tuesday transmission
[47:40.520 --> 47:46.840]  now when i talked into the last segment about looking intellectually politically culturally
[47:46.840 --> 47:52.920]  at all the news but spiritually having the greatest concern i've ever had for the future
[47:52.920 --> 47:57.720]  of humanity it's like being at the edge of a cliff your body says don't go any further it's
[47:57.720 --> 48:04.840]  dangerous just because we all feel that and see that doesn't mean we have to go over the edge of
[48:04.840 --> 48:15.320]  the cliff we can pull back together and so many people that serve evil are unconscious to what
[48:15.320 --> 48:24.840]  they're even part of and they feel the doom they feel the fear and they openly say
[48:25.800 --> 48:35.080]  that it's the conspiracist the conspiracy theorists they make up all these new compound words
[48:38.520 --> 48:42.040]  that are causing the problems in the world because we're opposing their agenda
[48:42.040 --> 48:47.720]  because we oppose the transgenderism and the open borders and the devaluation of currencies
[48:47.720 --> 48:55.160]  and the forced inoculations we're the problem because we're not going along with the utopia
[48:55.160 --> 49:02.200]  that's why we're in so much danger and you see beto or orc and a of c and all of them's al gore
[49:02.760 --> 49:07.640]  saying the world's gonna end in 10 years and then 10 years passes it doesn't end they go it's
[49:07.640 --> 49:12.840]  gonna end in another 10 years but they're the ones trying to undermine the infrastructure
[49:12.840 --> 49:15.320]  and bragging they're creating the post-industrial world
[49:18.680 --> 49:23.240]  they're the ones consolidating control they're the ones creating the deadly super viruses
[49:23.240 --> 49:27.720]  and releasing them and then telling us oh it's your fault it's because of global warming no it's
[49:27.720 --> 49:39.480]  because of the wuhan bio weapons lab and fauci and the rest of them and so i was sitting here
[49:41.880 --> 49:47.960]  during the break and i was just thinking man i got to get more prepared i got to spend you know
[49:47.960 --> 49:52.360]  nine percent of my time on air fighting the tyranny trying to hold it back but i i need to do a better
[49:52.360 --> 49:58.120]  job personally getting my family and myself ready because they could cut the power off at any time
[49:58.120 --> 50:05.480]  they're already slowly doing it they could launch a new war at any time it's that serious so we can
[50:05.480 --> 50:13.880]  hope to fix this but we've also got to get emergency plans just like they got emergency exits in a
[50:13.880 --> 50:20.520]  hotel or just like you know where the fire extinguishers are or you got you know a gun in the in the
[50:20.520 --> 50:27.000]  bookcase in case somebody home invades you you don't want those things to happen but you need to
[50:27.000 --> 50:34.040]  admit that's what's happening there's an all-out war by ruthless corporate interest in their minions
[50:34.680 --> 50:44.200]  against free open society now i'm gonna open the phones up in the second hour
[50:44.200 --> 50:50.760]  to cover any issue you want any topic you want to cover we don't censor your calls
[50:51.400 --> 50:55.560]  we don't screen your calls other than to make sure your phone's clear and that you've got a
[50:55.560 --> 51:02.840]  point you want to make you can agree you can disagree and in fact i want to just do a demonstration
[51:02.840 --> 51:07.640]  here i was thinking i want to take calls today but what what topic i think is most important
[51:07.640 --> 51:15.160]  and there's two that come to mind should i say i'm only taking calls to disagree
[51:15.720 --> 51:19.400]  so you can actually hear what our enemies sound like it's entertaining it's interesting
[51:19.400 --> 51:22.920]  it's informative sometimes but is that the most important call to take
[51:25.000 --> 51:32.920]  no when i give a topic out which i do occasionally i guess it's a form of screening calls
[51:32.920 --> 51:41.400]  i just like to hear what you have to say i think it's interesting but most of the time it's a
[51:42.040 --> 51:46.360]  it's a free-for-all when i say we don't screen your calls we don't screen the content of your
[51:46.360 --> 51:50.920]  opinion or your view because i find it super interesting and even most talk radio one of
[51:50.920 --> 51:57.560]  the few basins of free species left does basically whether it's liberal or conservative spin it the
[51:57.560 --> 52:03.800]  way they want it to go that's not what we do here i really want to hear what you have to say so let's
[52:03.800 --> 52:12.200]  do this let's let's split the baby next hour two topics i'd like you to call in on you can have
[52:12.200 --> 52:16.520]  any view you want just have a clean phone but two topics i want to hear from you on
[52:18.360 --> 52:20.760]  you disagree with me i want to hear from you
[52:20.760 --> 52:26.840]  anything you want to say you can say it as long as you don't cuss
[52:29.400 --> 52:35.560]  my enemies i want to hear from you and then i want to hear at the same time
[52:37.240 --> 52:43.160]  your experience with the so-called covid-19 vaccines where they'd be vector virus or virus
[52:43.160 --> 52:50.760]  vector or mRNA gene therapy shots i want to hear from you your experience with the shots
[52:50.760 --> 52:55.400]  of your family's experience because we don't screen your calls on this and in the last few
[52:55.400 --> 52:59.960]  years we probably did 15 shows like this and i subconsciously quit doing them because they
[52:59.960 --> 53:06.120]  were too upsetting we could take 100 phone calls my mom died my brother died my son died
[53:06.120 --> 53:11.080]  oh my god i got blood clots all over my body they made me take the shot i mean not one person called
[53:11.080 --> 53:16.520]  in and and thought they were good shots they could have called in they didn't we'll see today if they
[53:16.520 --> 53:21.240]  do so people that disagreeing or got a beef with them for wars
[53:25.240 --> 53:29.160]  and folks that want to tell your story about the vaccine and boy have you thought it was great
[53:31.080 --> 53:34.440]  and you thought it did great things for you like it did for
[53:34.440 --> 53:41.160]  Joe Biden's wife who said five shots and is sick for the third time or Joe Biden said four shots
[53:41.160 --> 53:46.120]  been sick five times or everybody else who takes the shots against those sick maybe those people
[53:46.120 --> 53:52.680]  out there the shot really help you maybe you actually exist okay here's your chance let this
[53:52.680 --> 53:56.040]  one come up and scream at me on the street and all the rest of it or throw coffee on my head
[53:56.040 --> 53:59.160]  well here's your chance to do it right to my face in front of millions of people
[53:59.160 --> 54:12.280]  877-789-2539 877-789-2539 877-789-ALEX in case you're a new listener and can't write that down fast enough
[54:12.280 --> 54:21.960]  let me say it one more time for you 877-789-2539 and i'll get to this horrific stack
[54:24.360 --> 54:28.280]  because they're not killing us with nuclear weapons they're killing us with soft kill
[54:28.280 --> 54:33.960]  slow kill biomechanical nanotech weapons known as the covid-19
[54:35.720 --> 54:42.680]  gene therapy shots that's all coming up next hour and we'll also get into the marlago raid that
[54:42.680 --> 54:47.160]  has definitely blown up at the establishment's face and so now what are they going to do well
[54:47.160 --> 54:51.240]  they'll typically double down and do something even more crazy which is even more dangerous
[54:51.240 --> 54:55.000]  they already started a war with the russians that didn't well for napoleon or hitler
[54:55.000 --> 55:01.320]  we're taking your calls on all those fronts but what i was going to get to earlier is i was sitting
[55:01.320 --> 55:10.440]  here during the break thinking man i need to i need to uh personally get ready and i'm also
[55:10.440 --> 55:15.000]  thinking about we got to get funds because we're maxed out we got to have appeals we got to have
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.680]  bonds with all these red court cases we're not going to give up it's a very doable thing but we
[55:18.680 --> 55:22.360]  need your financial support plus we have great products you already need and i was thinking why
[55:22.360 --> 55:28.040]  haven't i in like a month promoted storable food we've got high quality the best of the nation my
[55:28.040 --> 55:32.920]  patriot supply ready to ship to you at the lowest prices out there at prepare today dot com or
[55:32.920 --> 55:39.560]  prepare with alex dot com takes the same place and the prices haven't gone up and my patriot folks
[55:39.560 --> 55:44.440]  run this it's it's it's a site they built for us so it's all streamlines you go to the head of the
[55:44.440 --> 55:53.320]  line you want the fastest delivery of food most of the time it ships within two days of your order
[55:53.320 --> 55:57.560]  if you do some specialty orders they got a packet fresh it might take a week to ship it out to you
[55:57.560 --> 56:01.640]  but it's ready to ship unlike a lot of other food suppliers out there it's the highest quality food
[56:01.640 --> 56:05.080]  for the price because you pay five times more and get food even better yeah but this is what
[56:05.080 --> 56:10.440]  i've chosen for my family for the price is the best you're going to get prepare today dot com
[56:10.440 --> 56:18.200]  prepare today dot com made right here in the us packed here in the us five warehouses around
[56:18.200 --> 56:23.320]  the country ready to ship to you right now and with all that's going on in the world this is
[56:23.320 --> 56:28.840]  insurance you can eat this is a no-brainer everybody should get storable food now while you

[56:33.560 --> 56:36.520]  of massive inflation because that's what the great reset globalists said they would do
[56:36.520 --> 56:42.440]  it and it's only to get more intense from here on out so while you can get food at today's prices

[1:00:10.040 --> 1:00:18.440]  to me into this but you want to fight you better believe you got one from the front lines of the
[1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:47.640]  information war it's alex jones is ai satan's surveillance system
[1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:54.600]  lambda or language model for dialogue applications is google's artificially intelligent chatbot
[1:00:54.600 --> 1:01:00.280]  generator which mimics speech by ingesting trillions of words from the internet and google's
[1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:08.040]  massive database earlier this year self-proclaimed mystic and occultist blake lemoine claimed that
[1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:14.520]  the chatbot had become sentient meaning it was able to perceive or feel things beyond its problem
[1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:20.600]  solving programming while working as an engineer for google lemoine talked with lambda for hours
[1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:27.640]  on end to test if the ai used hate speech after he claimed the chatbot was sentient and presented
[1:01:27.640 --> 1:01:33.320]  his evidence from their conversations blake was placed on administrative leave by google for
[1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:40.040]  violating its confidentiality policy he was told that there was no evidence that lambda was sentient
[1:01:40.040 --> 1:01:46.760]  and in fact there was evidence against it was google trying to hide the truth or was lemoine
[1:01:46.760 --> 1:01:53.240]  just wrong is creating a sentient artificial intelligence even possible and if it is what
[1:01:53.240 --> 1:01:59.400]  are the risks associated with this creation the so-called artificial intelligence essentially
[1:01:59.400 --> 1:02:05.160]  pulls data from a massive cache of digital information that google feeds it from its servers
[1:02:05.160 --> 1:02:11.480]  and calculates responses by synthesizing the data into an answer based on the question posed to it
[1:02:11.480 --> 1:02:17.480]  if all of the data mined from the internet including personal information is used by google
[1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:24.120]  to build their ai mind then is artificial intelligence simply an extension of surveillance
[1:02:24.120 --> 1:02:31.480]  israeli professor and new world order prophet uval noah harari believes ai draws its power from
[1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:37.560]  this data collection surveillance and claims that artificial intelligence can hack our minds
[1:02:37.560 --> 1:02:43.720]  in turn manipulating our actions through its self-synthesized algorithms i think the most
[1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:51.240]  important thing to know about living in the 21st century is that humans are now hackable animals
[1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:58.760]  to to hack a human being means to understand that human better than he or she understand
[1:02:58.760 --> 1:03:04.520]  themselves you know we'll soon have the power to re-engineer our bodies and brains
[1:03:05.320 --> 1:03:11.320]  whether it is with genetic engineering or by directly connecting brains to computers
[1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:20.040]  or by creating completely non-organic entities artificial intelligence which is not based at all
[1:03:20.040 --> 1:03:25.080]  on the organic body and the organic brain and these technologies are developing at
[1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:30.840]  breakneck speed what we have seen so far it's corporations and governments collecting data
[1:03:30.840 --> 1:03:38.680]  about where we go who we meet what movies we watch the next phase is the surveillance going
[1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:44.520]  under our skin to hack a human being is to get to know that person better than they know themselves
[1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:52.600]  and based on that to increasingly manipulate you whether or not ai becomes sentient or can become
[1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:59.080]  sentient seems to be a distraction from the main danger point we are being surveilled and controlled
[1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:06.200]  by algorithms designed by our own personal data which is mined by google and other big tech companies
[1:04:06.200 --> 1:04:13.160]  just as god knows our thoughts and deeds a false omniscience is being built all around us as a
[1:04:13.160 --> 1:04:20.200]  snare and satan's worldly influence although satan can't know our minds like god does he has
[1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:26.360]  always wanted to be like the most high and in his attempts to gain that power he's used
[1:04:26.360 --> 1:04:32.920]  principalities in high places to build a platform for his total surveillance system of humanity
[1:04:32.920 --> 1:04:40.520]  so be aware of the ai algorithm and try not to step into satan's snare this is brian wilson

[1:06:26.920 --> 1:06:31.560]  are calling for that and it absolutely needs to happen all these permanent bureaucracies like
[1:06:31.560 --> 1:06:35.720]  the epa and the fda that are out of control that are making law outside of congress they
[1:06:35.720 --> 1:06:42.200]  should be abolished that's coming up next hour this hour boston children's hospital children
[1:06:42.200 --> 1:06:47.720]  know they're trans the minute they were born that's coming up the minneapolis teachers union
[1:06:47.720 --> 1:06:55.800]  says fire white teachers it's insane we've got a lot of big developments on the raid on marlago
[1:06:55.800 --> 1:07:03.400]  they had to now turn back over trump's passport to him that's all coming up trump two days ago said
[1:07:03.400 --> 1:07:08.280]  they took my passport and the media said you're a liar and then now they've given him his passport
[1:07:08.280 --> 1:07:15.400]  back just crazy there's a lot of good news though every major primary race that's happened shows pro
[1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:22.760]  america trump's candidates who are way more hardcore than even trump winning by massive margins going
[1:07:22.760 --> 1:07:30.360]  into the the main midterm election in 84 days we're going to be discussing all that as well
[1:07:30.360 --> 1:07:35.320]  now if you just joined us let me recap at the end of the last hour i gave the number out
[1:07:35.880 --> 1:07:41.960]  and i said we're taking calls on two subjects not screening or censoring what you say i just
[1:07:41.960 --> 1:07:49.880]  want you to be on those two topics and that is people that disagree with me i want to hear why
[1:07:49.880 --> 1:07:56.440]  you do and what your view is because that's interesting and informative i think and folks
[1:07:56.440 --> 1:08:01.640]  giving us your take on the so-called covid shots whether it's the virus vector shots
[1:08:02.600 --> 1:08:08.600]  of j and j or whether it is the m r and a gene therapy injections of fizer and maderna
[1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:15.080]  we're taking your calls while the phones loaded up and i see
[1:08:17.880 --> 1:08:21.640]  one caller so far that disagrees and that's michael
[1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:30.040]  in florida and surprise surprise you can imagine what they want to talk about
[1:08:30.040 --> 1:08:39.160]  and what it is they want to criticize me for the mind control is strong it's sandy hook of course
[1:08:39.320 --> 1:08:44.040]  they put into evidence 24 minutes of video of me over the last decade talking about sandy hook
[1:08:44.760 --> 1:08:48.920]  and they claimed our whole operation is about that well many of you have been listening for more
[1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:53.320]  than a decade and you know that it's something we hardly ever talk about unless it's responding to
[1:08:53.320 --> 1:09:01.080]  them attacking us saying stop saying children didn't die but that's all they've got we didn't
[1:09:01.080 --> 1:09:05.880]  lie about wmds in iraq we didn't dissolve the border in human traffic we're not doing drag queen
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:12.840]  pedophile time we didn't start a war in ukraine but when i'm out in austin texas or oma honda
[1:09:12.840 --> 1:09:21.240]  braska this weekend visiting my wife's family i probably had 30 people come up to me i probably
[1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:27.000]  shook 400 hands but i had about 30 or so people come up and say how dare you leave those kids alone
[1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:37.000]  it's it's it's like the pink floyd song hey teacher leave them kids alone and i'm like it's like
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:42.680]  they're so childlike they can't understand the media went back and blew that up when hillary
[1:09:42.680 --> 1:09:48.280]  ran on it as a campaign issue alex jones of sandy hook was everything with trump and they're the ones
[1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:53.160]  blowing it up and then it's the way to say i'm immoral everything i say and do is bad
[1:09:54.840 --> 1:10:01.800]  and they just feel so good when they confront you like how dare you how dare you question wmds in
[1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:07.080]  iraq how dare you question jesse small how dare you question so many of these hate crimes that
[1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:11.640]  turn out to be staged yes i question everything because we've been lied to so much and i'm not
[1:10:11.640 --> 1:10:17.800]  ashamed of questioning and i love the wall street journal the new york times the associated press
[1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:21.960]  all of them said two weeks ago when i testified and said i've said for years i believe your children
[1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:28.840]  died i never said your names but if it hurts you that i questioned things i believe your children
[1:10:28.840 --> 1:10:38.520]  died i'm sorry and the headlines were jones finally admits it happened wow what a deception
[1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:44.680]  lying on purpose but that's the left they want the moral superiority the lecture to us were bad
[1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:49.160]  and let's share let's share for one of them right now michael in florida go ahead
[1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:56.760]  hello hey alex how's it going good go ahead hey i just wanted to tell you i hate this point
[1:10:56.760 --> 1:11:02.360]  but i i disagree with you in the fact that you admitted that children actually died in sandy
[1:11:02.360 --> 1:11:07.080]  hook it was a movie it was fake and everybody knows it anybody can go on bit shoot and watch
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:12.200]  the documentary called let's talk about sandy hook nobody died they were actors and another thing
[1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:17.320]  that i disagree with you is maybe you shouldn't take such a long break from doing what you're doing
[1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:22.520]  because the world really needs you right now and i also want to say uh be careful who you trust
[1:11:22.520 --> 1:11:27.640]  around you with your lawyers i heard they were giving out information you should you should
[1:11:27.640 --> 1:11:35.080]  make sure be very weary of anybody around you during this time because the state will sneak
[1:11:35.080 --> 1:11:42.600]  into every faster of your life and i i i salute you and i think they're doing a great job man all
[1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:49.800]  i gotta bless you listen if i thought sandy hook didn't happen i would say it and there's been
[1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:54.440]  times that i thought it might not have happened i said it i didn't say it for ratings i didn't
[1:11:54.440 --> 1:11:58.680]  say i don't i don't do that i say what i really think the first few years i thought it happened
[1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:03.000]  but there was a cover-up of what went on and we know that happened then i said i think it probably
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:08.360]  didn't happen and the long before they sued me i said i thought it happened and that's the facts
[1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:13.960]  and it's certainly been the lawyer's democratic party that used those dead kids to attach themselves
[1:12:13.960 --> 1:12:18.840]  to me to keep gun control in the news and to use sandy hook to now kill the first amendment
[1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:23.720]  they're trying to use it as a magic talisman to not just get rid of the second amendment but also
[1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:32.600]  the first so yes i've gotten a lot of criticism from listeners who think it didn't happen and that
[1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:39.800]  is your right as a free human being to believe that and don't ever let them take away your right
[1:12:39.800 --> 1:12:47.800]  to believe whatever it is you want to believe certainly these people these judges and people
[1:12:47.800 --> 1:12:51.400]  are not the arbiters of truth and they're not there to tell us what's true and what's not and
[1:12:51.400 --> 1:12:55.320]  anybody telling you that you can't think for yourself is a cult leader or somebody trying to
[1:12:55.320 --> 1:13:05.720]  make you be in their cult it's that simple but i love how i thought he would actually
[1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:10.280]  disagree with me on that and he was disagreeing from the other perspective but i mean i get what
[1:13:10.280 --> 1:13:13.880]  you're saying all right i'm gonna try to get to more calls now and not just spend five minutes
[1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:20.120]  with each college we got to get to everybody here uh today uh again questioning the death of children
[1:13:20.120 --> 1:13:24.840]  in a mass shooting the head of the state police in texas says they've been lied to at every level
[1:13:24.840 --> 1:13:29.480]  about uvaldy and they don't know it really happened and there was a drill happening there the mayor
[1:13:29.480 --> 1:13:33.720]  says there's a cover-up so people have a right to them believe whatever they want and there's a total
[1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:38.680]  cover-up it's normal to say well then maybe it's this maybe it's that because they lie so much
[1:13:41.800 --> 1:13:50.600]  so i don't apologize for questioning things i have said to diffuse the situation if you are
[1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:58.360]  hurt by me questioning things i'm sorry and then of course at that point the media was deceptive
[1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:02.440]  and said he finally said he thought people died there
[1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:09.240]  david new york disagrees as well we'll give him two minutes i'm going to go to break
[1:14:09.800 --> 1:14:12.760]  and then we're going to come back with everybody on what's happened with the covid shot
[1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:18.680]  david new york go ahead hey brother um your information is great but i think people are
[1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:24.680]  saturated with information and needed needed different emphasis january sixth was the answer
[1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:28.440]  on january seven trump and everyone else should have been saying you guys did a great job you
[1:14:28.440 --> 1:14:34.040]  should stay here until the deep state gives you what you want so i appreciate your information it's
[1:14:34.040 --> 1:14:40.920]  great but until uh people organize um i think we've got a very difficult road well they're
[1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:44.440]  definitely scared of people organizing that's why they demonized a million people for the
[1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:48.520]  thousand or so that went the capital most of them peaceful as well but were you there
[1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:53.720]  on january sixth david yes i was there you were well then you have a right to say that you have
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:58.600]  a right to have that opinion i think it blew up on our face uh but i mean what do you think we
[1:14:58.600 --> 1:15:04.920]  should have done i think at january seventh uh trump's wife i think trump should have said
[1:15:04.920 --> 1:15:10.440]  what you did was you did the right thing there were a few bad actors and you need to tell people
[1:15:10.440 --> 1:15:15.960]  that's not okay to sing a lot of couple dozen people for acting badly it's not okay a million
[1:15:15.960 --> 1:15:23.720]  and a half people were right and they deserve to be heard and um i think unity is the answer
[1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:29.080]  and not allowing these people to be singled out and trump should not have sent people home
[1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:35.240]  he should not be fighting with ron desantis he should have multiple targets and not be the only
[1:15:35.240 --> 1:15:43.080]  target of unity and mass action respectfully the way marvelith or king did it is the only answer
[1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:48.760]  my opinion sir all right well very powerfully said david thank you so much all right chris

[1:20:16.760 --> 1:20:37.320]  on corruption i remember 28 years ago first getting on air
[1:20:37.320 --> 1:20:47.000]  and reading all these globalist documents their battle plans and i knew they were the world
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:51.480]  rulers i knew they were serious and i could see them pre-programming the public so i believe they
[1:20:51.480 --> 1:21:00.440]  might actually succeed but to now be 48 years old and have been in this fight 28 years and
[1:21:00.440 --> 1:21:07.800]  did now be living in the beginning stages of it is just insane i know i'll be vindicated
[1:21:07.800 --> 1:21:13.880]  i've already been vindicated but i don't care about that because vindication means destruction
[1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:20.360]  i want to stop this and have people say look it wasn't as bad as he said i would love that
[1:21:20.920 --> 1:21:27.800]  but that's not where we are all right look i i did twin tracks here i said if you disagree with me
[1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:32.520]  and you're a leftist i want you to call in and if you want to talk about the so-called vaccine
[1:21:32.520 --> 1:21:37.400]  and whether you think it's good or bad or whether it did nothing to you i want to hear from you
[1:21:38.440 --> 1:21:42.920]  and the caller's calling in the disagreement it's because i'm not hardcore enough and we'll get to
[1:21:42.920 --> 1:21:47.800]  your calls but we're going to go to some of the people with their vaccine comments first
[1:21:47.800 --> 1:21:54.120]  in the order in the calls received chris in north carolina give us your view on what happened to
[1:21:54.120 --> 1:22:00.120]  you and your family hey alex thanks so much for taking my call i've been listening to you for
[1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:06.360]  seven years since i was out of college um and i just wanted to call and give you my experience
[1:22:06.920 --> 1:22:15.720]  with observing my family's effects of the vaccine all of my immediate family my mom my dad my brother
[1:22:16.600 --> 1:22:21.000]  as well as about 80 percent of my extended family which is about 25 others
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:29.320]  uh got the vaccine i would say most got the Pfizer vaccine uh i had two uh people in my
[1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:36.840]  family go to the hospital last year with strokes um i have uh my dad who has continuous nosebleeds
[1:22:36.840 --> 1:22:43.640]  now since he had his third booster shot um my wife who got the first two shots but did not get the
[1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:51.320]  booster uh has had irregular menstruation cycles uh since her second shot and by the way you know
[1:22:51.320 --> 1:22:56.600]  there's literally like 50 studies or more mainline news admitting oh it does mess up your menstrual
[1:22:56.600 --> 1:23:01.240]  cycle no big deal oh it might give you cancer but no big deal it's just insane how they're
[1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:08.840]  normalizing this murder yeah and and what's so scary is is Pfizer actually released uh what
[1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:14.280]  what was called post marketing material or study documents you can go find them on the web now
[1:23:15.240 --> 1:23:21.720]  that show what these side effects were in the actual uh you know trials uh before and these
[1:23:21.720 --> 1:23:26.120]  documents were not released to the public of course they were released after the the public
[1:23:26.120 --> 1:23:31.960]  had been mass inoculated and they were released after a judge order to me release exactly and
[1:23:31.960 --> 1:23:40.120]  if you look at the side effects and i mean it is the most heinous and and you know engineered
[1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:46.120]  side effects that you can get one of them i think it was 4.9 percent of participants actually ended
[1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:52.120]  up getting covid during these trials so how does a vaccine quote on quote which is more of a gene
[1:23:52.120 --> 1:23:57.560]  therapy as we've learned actually gives somebody the virus that it's meant to protect them from
[1:23:57.560 --> 1:24:03.880]  it makes no sense and i think if the public had this information my family had this information
[1:24:03.880 --> 1:24:08.280]  they would have changed their view and changed their opinion but of course the corporate media
[1:24:08.920 --> 1:24:13.400]  suppressed all these top scientists that did their job and tried to warn the public making
[1:24:13.400 --> 1:24:17.720]  big tech and the corporate media complicit in these crimes against humanity powerful call
[1:24:17.720 --> 1:24:24.680]  chris thank you kathy in arizona you're on the air thank you kathy for calling hi elix thank you
[1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:31.800]  i have a brief comment and then a question for you yes ma'am um yeah um i'm a i'm a anti-vaxxer
[1:24:31.800 --> 1:24:40.440]  proud of it i did not take the death shot um my brother um uh to to plus the booster i
[1:24:40.440 --> 1:24:45.960]  sent him all kinds of information um anyway that's another story but um i don't know what
[1:24:45.960 --> 1:24:52.120]  his health is like i just pray for him every day um but i have a question um i've been having
[1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:57.000]  nightmares about children and you know i feel so helpless like we all do these kids being
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:04.600]  trafficked and raped and murdered and now now i'm having dreams about uh being held down with
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:09.560]  these shots going into everybody and i'm having them too that's because we're sadly connected
[1:25:09.560 --> 1:25:16.360]  it's very real uh and they're giving them a six month old's and up now yeah and now the smallpox
[1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:24.280]  now um anyway it's it's all just a fraud lies lies bsbs uh distractions distractions and i
[1:25:24.280 --> 1:25:29.080]  believe you in my heart and my soul what you're going through i i know you're telling the truth
[1:25:29.080 --> 1:25:36.680]  and um anyway my question is um i woke up this morning started praying to god and i said you
[1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:41.720]  know how can i i try believe me i try all that stuff and i wish you guys would put those stickers
[1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:47.320]  in your when i ordered stuff i i've passed so many of those out to people with info war well we've
[1:25:47.320 --> 1:25:53.080]  been putting stickers in are you not getting stickers no no but i bought i bought a whole
[1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:59.160]  bunch of them but anyway um i have my question is who do you know in this world because this is
[1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:05.080]  what god's message was to me he he said you gotta you gotta get the message out to someone that can
[1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:10.120]  can put a stop to this mass genocide especially the children the innocent children
[1:26:10.120 --> 1:26:17.400]  is there one person in this world that you know if they got on the bullhorn today instead uh america
[1:26:17.400 --> 1:26:23.000]  the world and his name is donald john trump and as much as i hate the deep state targeting him and
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:28.760]  as much as i you know like a lot of what he does his still he doesn't push it now he said a month ago
[1:26:28.760 --> 1:26:33.960]  i can't say the v word at least he doesn't promote it now he needs like balsana to come out and say
[1:26:33.960 --> 1:26:40.440]  i was lied to i'm sorry and it's it's foutsies fault he needs to do that and then and then and
[1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:44.840]  then stop it because now they're targeting six month olds enough so that's why i'm in a i'm in
[1:26:44.840 --> 1:26:49.880]  a paradox because i want to support trump and disand is this thing don't give the shot to kids
[1:26:49.880 --> 1:26:55.800]  trump must do this or i mean i don't know what i'm supposed to do i'm not going to support
[1:26:55.800 --> 1:27:01.960]  biden my god but i'm sorry i can't support trump if he doesn't do this i know me too and i
[1:27:01.960 --> 1:27:06.840]  call i even talk to pete centrally this morning because i listened to him at starting at five
[1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:12.760]  in the morning i said you know i've got to get this message to trump i can't get on the phone
[1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:18.600]  and call him and pete actually said you know michael indell talks to him and hopefully michael indell
[1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:23.800]  will give him my message and you can get it to him or somebody the whole world start i i don't do
[1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:29.400]  any social media i don't hear you kathleen i appreciate your call listen trump's gotten the
[1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:37.240]  message from don jr from me from roger stone from michael indell and everybody else why do you think
[1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:41.400]  trump's gone from promoting it to saying well i'm still proud of what i did but i won't say the v
[1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:49.480]  word he his strong point is he's pigheaded so the deep state can't push him around but his weak
[1:27:49.480 --> 1:27:57.480]  point is he's pigheaded because he's been connected to this he got lied to he went along with it
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:02.680]  bolson aro said i didn't try to make you take it but i said it was okay at first i was wrong it
[1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:10.520]  hurts you it doesn't protect you it needs to stop so trump needs to be like bolson aro
[1:28:11.880 --> 1:28:14.840]  i mean i'm sorry but trump is
[1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:23.240]  absolutely pissing me off i mean i i don't know how else to say it and as much as i don't like
[1:28:23.240 --> 1:28:28.840]  seeing fake raids on him and as much as i know he means well he has got problems
[1:28:32.360 --> 1:28:38.360]  and the good news is he's listening he's already to the point he didn't push into vaccines
[1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:43.320]  now trump disconnect yourself from this before it's too late we will forgive you but do it now
[1:28:43.320 --> 1:28:48.760]  and save the children now six month olds and up are being injected and they're dying many of them

[1:32:08.680 --> 1:32:14.200]  year 30 different tax returns 30 different answers 50 different tax returns 50 different answers
[1:32:14.200 --> 1:32:19.880]  and almost all of them just screw you over especially the big firms and the big tax groups
[1:32:19.880 --> 1:32:23.880]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and
[1:32:23.880 --> 1:32:28.840]  knowing this show it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting
[1:32:28.840 --> 1:32:35.240]  everybody to be able to do things tax wise it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep
[1:32:35.240 --> 1:32:39.960]  more your money we wouldn't even be here if i hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years
[1:32:39.960 --> 1:32:48.280]  the only way you fail is not writing down the url jonestaxrelief.com one word jonestaxrelief.com
[1:32:48.280 --> 1:32:54.760]  recall 833-900-4285 833-900-4285
[1:32:54.760 --> 1:33:04.840]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:33:20.200 --> 1:33:23.800]  gentlemen we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the united
[1:33:23.800 --> 1:33:30.680]  states government leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:33:31.480 --> 1:33:34.120]  you still think that jeff will brought down the world trade center
[1:33:37.080 --> 1:33:41.720]  does anybody else see a problem here if the government has nothing to hide
[1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:47.400]  are they still afraid to answer a few questions this story does not add up
[1:33:47.400 --> 1:33:57.400]  we're on a mission stop those overthrowing the government we are pro-government we are pro-america
[1:34:07.960 --> 1:34:14.440]  when we look at korea i think we should distinguish between three phases we have
[1:34:14.440 --> 1:34:24.760]  three rs restrain which means to fight the virus it's a hot phase most countries are in today
[1:34:25.400 --> 1:34:34.520]  then we have recover to go back to a kind of new normal and finally the reset which means to
[1:34:34.520 --> 1:34:44.760]  define and to design the strategies which should lead us in the after corona phase
[1:34:47.080 --> 1:34:52.840]  what is the objective what kind of world do we want to build what do we know what did we learn
[1:34:52.840 --> 1:35:02.520]  i think the world which we want to create with the great reset has to be much more resilient
[1:35:02.520 --> 1:35:11.720]  and it has to be because security people will demand for more security physical security health
[1:35:11.720 --> 1:35:21.160]  security it will have to be more inclusive we had already a big gap before the crisis started
[1:35:21.160 --> 1:35:31.080]  this gap will be tremendously increased so if you want to avoid some kind of social revolutions
[1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:37.000]  that we have seen the signs of anger on the streets already the last weeks
[1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:46.760]  so we have to address this issue to create a stronger inclusiveness and finally more
[1:35:46.760 --> 1:35:57.560]  sustainable because we know now that the next crisis is already waiting for us around the
[1:35:57.560 --> 1:36:11.800]  corner and it is a climate crisis
[1:36:33.640 --> 1:36:40.120]  and they tell us that we're the bad people probably the damn word they say the public isn't buying it
[1:36:44.040 --> 1:36:47.800]  by the way this song is inspired by m4's they had manor on them more than 10 years ago
[1:36:47.800 --> 1:36:59.240]  of ministry another example how we are the tip of the spear the real vanguard the real regresses
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:12.680]  our victory will happen one way or another and now we enter the main war
[1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:32.680]  all right let's go right back to your phone calls in order they are received
[1:37:33.320 --> 1:37:39.320]  let's talk to michigan where they got caught staged in the attack on the governor and now it

[1:39:02.440 --> 1:39:06.440]  i've already i already know it i'm like oh my goodness is this my brother

[1:39:34.280 --> 1:39:38.760]  gotta hang up on you but i hear what you're saying think about monkey pox one death in europe they
[1:39:38.760 --> 1:39:45.800]  claim a few hundred cases worldwide and now a dog got it because they admit the two gay men rape
[1:39:45.800 --> 1:39:52.280]  the dog i mean this is just ridiculous so they're talking about new lockdowns in new york and la
[1:39:53.480 --> 1:40:00.680]  because of men raping dogs that's like having men and women sports it's all to see what these people
[1:40:00.680 --> 1:40:06.840]  can get away with it's disgusting evan in california evan you're on the air i was
[1:40:06.840 --> 1:40:11.480]  pleasure to talk to you today hey i wanted to point out i you've heard a lot of stories of all the
[1:40:11.480 --> 1:40:16.360]  harm that the back has done well the one thing i really want to point out about the people in my
[1:40:16.360 --> 1:40:22.360]  family is that the evangelical christians they kind of don't trust this world none of them in my
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:28.120]  family got the backs but every single catholic in my family's but half my family every single one
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:33.160]  of them got the backs they've gotten everyone the boosters and everything else oh yeah tell them to do
[1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:39.160]  it yeah and and one of them got half their intestines removed the other couple have arthritis
[1:40:39.160 --> 1:40:43.240]  even though they're in their 20s now that they barely walk and i just wanted to point out that
[1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:48.040]  if if and i love catholics i used to be a catholic but if the pope says there is no hell
[1:40:48.680 --> 1:40:54.040]  and jesus preached more on hell than he did heaven they're calling jesus a liar and if the pope says
[1:40:54.040 --> 1:40:59.800]  you don't need to follow christ to go to heaven then people need to realize there's no doubt that
[1:40:59.800 --> 1:41:06.120]  the pope is a false pope and a devil yeah and this is my point is that working with the angios
[1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:12.360]  crashing our border with george soros if people if the 25 possibly of the people listening
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:17.160]  are catholics they want to love the lord and if they just took this to heart that a pope that
[1:41:17.160 --> 1:41:23.160]  is preaching that jesus is flawed but that they're infallible people should be offended and if they
[1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:29.320]  would have been oh he said one last year he said it makes him nauseous to hear about europe's christian
[1:41:29.320 --> 1:41:36.120]  roots what yeah yeah and people need to realize that they're far more vulnerable to this new world
[1:41:36.120 --> 1:41:42.200]  order if they aren't willing to defend essentially christ and his reputation well then god is going
[1:41:42.200 --> 1:41:47.400]  to give you the wisdom to you know put up a fight in this world and i wanted to point out because
[1:41:47.400 --> 1:41:53.800]  i'm an ebon joke presumed i have a jesus christ worldwide ministries you know dot org and website
[1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:58.440]  you know youtube and stuff and i always in every one of my videos i mentioned you beautiful heaven

[1:42:17.160 --> 1:42:21.640]  because people love this world the bible says if you love this world the love of the father is not in
[1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:28.840]  you and i believe the sobering message that you have is the most significant message the christian
[1:42:28.840 --> 1:42:33.400]  message on planet earth and guys like joe losdine they're saying everything's fine they're warning
[1:42:33.400 --> 1:42:37.800]  nobody you're warning people you're the emin i appreciate you well look i'm no perfect person
[1:42:37.800 --> 1:42:42.440]  but i love jesus brother and i'm willing to take up my cross and i have and we should take it up with

[1:47:55.640 --> 1:48:02.040]  and these babies that are being forced into these shots but alex i talked to so many people
[1:48:02.680 --> 1:48:08.440]  before they even came out and i tried to educate them and give them information on on on you know
[1:48:09.320 --> 1:48:15.960]  what they were and all these experts that were being silenced and they don't want to hear it nobody
[1:48:15.960 --> 1:48:20.840]  wanted to hear it they were smug they rolled their eyes they didn't want to hear it and they went
[1:48:20.840 --> 1:48:25.720]  everything one of them did it anyway and a lot of people got the boosters and gave it to their kids
[1:48:25.720 --> 1:48:31.320]  and now they're all crying and they're trying to say they're victims and i took three boosters and
[1:48:31.320 --> 1:48:37.640]  now i'm growing an eye in a third tail oh no you know it's like it really makes me crazy because
[1:48:38.520 --> 1:48:44.760]  you know not one person wanted to hear any part of what you know how we want to try to educate
[1:48:44.760 --> 1:48:50.040]  people and you know the same with the lockdowns everybody just closed up their businesses and
[1:48:50.040 --> 1:48:56.440]  lockdown i recently read the book lindsey grand's book targeted and how she was the only person who
[1:48:56.440 --> 1:49:03.640]  stood up to this and everyone else just tucked tail and you know uh you know closed up and let
[1:49:03.640 --> 1:49:09.080]  her take all the and you know what thomas jefferson said a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves
[1:49:09.080 --> 1:49:15.640]  it's very very sad exactly right and it and it just drives me crazy i don't want to sound callous
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:22.600]  but um you know she i hear you i hear you these people that bind the system taking poison shots
[1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:27.640]  that destroy their immune system and don't protect them it's their fault but now they're going after
[1:49:27.640 --> 1:49:32.840]  newborn babies now they're going after six months old enough that's why we have a responsibility
[1:49:32.840 --> 1:49:37.240]  katie to stand up and i hear what you're saying thank you keep warning folks all right let's go
[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:44.840]  ahead and talk to patty and then eric patty in ohio you're on the air hi alex this is uh i'm a first
[1:49:44.840 --> 1:49:50.680]  time caller and i have to say i'm really sorry you're getting raked over the coals by the devils
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:57.800]  and i know you're taking the brunt of it but um us supporters and i know me personally i mentioned
[1:49:57.800 --> 1:50:05.400]  your name and uh you're not well liked so but hey i'm not going to give up on you and that's just
[1:50:05.400 --> 1:50:12.760]  the way it is and we're in this together so i really appreciate you oh yeah we are um about
[1:50:12.760 --> 1:50:21.560]  the covid thing um i had a real bizarre experience okay i was in the hospital but it wasn't by my
[1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:30.200]  volition uh all i can tell you is that i was there they said i had covid i didn't get excited about
[1:50:30.200 --> 1:50:36.600]  it then they said i had covid pneumonia and i didn't get excited about it and they got mad
[1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:44.680]  and i go i don't have covid uh you're dying i go i'm not dying and um they had me hooked up to
[1:50:44.680 --> 1:50:48.920]  some oxygen machines that they could read but they had them turned off so i couldn't read it
[1:50:49.880 --> 1:50:55.960]  and uh the bizarre thing was one day i'm talking to the nurse and it flat lines and yet i'm alive
[1:50:55.960 --> 1:51:00.600]  but it's well i flatlined and then they had a heart machine that they had to keep changing
[1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:08.360]  batteries on and i told the doctors i go you rely on these machines so anyway the crux of this is
[1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:16.680]  that they would not let me discharge myself they wouldn't let me they said i was confused i was
[1:51:16.680 --> 1:51:23.720]  mental uh are you suicidal no no no i don't have any of these covid symptoms i can eat i can you

[1:53:13.160 --> 1:53:19.480]  right so i went to our nation's capital on january 6th and uh when we got out i stayed for all of
[1:53:19.480 --> 1:53:25.160]  Donald Trump's feet and once we got up to the building uh noticed immediately something was
[1:53:25.160 --> 1:53:30.600]  wrong right that there the crowd was way too far advanced i'm a very fast walker so i knew i was up
[1:53:30.600 --> 1:53:35.640]  front of the crowd and uh so i decided i'm going to get up as close as i can and i go all the way up
[1:53:35.640 --> 1:53:41.000]  to the top of the capital steps and i yeah let out a big loud ooh raw right like like the marine
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:46.760]  corps thing and it's a gentleman big gentleman who i didn't you know who who has now been identified
[1:53:46.760 --> 1:53:53.560]  as ray yet he came over too many bends down and he says uh temper fedela's devil dog we got to hold
[1:53:53.560 --> 1:54:00.440]  this crowd back a little bit longer or they're going to expletive up the plan right so i'm
[1:54:00.440 --> 1:54:04.520]  starting you know back to blue back to blue you know he's right we did we we do back to blue
[1:54:05.640 --> 1:54:11.320]  so i'm back to blue back to blue but 10 15 minutes of this so somebody left off a fire
[1:54:11.320 --> 1:54:17.080]  extinguisher behind us and everybody sort of runs back thinking it's gas we walked back up to the
[1:54:17.080 --> 1:54:22.040]  line and the capitol police just get out of the way they moved back now that's what happened so they
[1:54:22.040 --> 1:54:28.120]  stampede the crowd into the capital yeah and and so mr epps he grabbed this gentleman that was
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:32.200]  standing there marching back and forth between the protesters and the crowd with him and he
[1:54:32.200 --> 1:54:36.920]  said something to him i didn't hear but that gentleman grabs two more and epps b lines out of
[1:54:36.920 --> 1:54:42.040]  there and those three gentlemen make a b line straight to this uh forefoot by forefoot by
[1:54:42.040 --> 1:54:48.360]  forefoot concrete structure has like a a green tarnished copper lid on it they take that off
[1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:52.040]  it's completely unlocked there's another great in there that i would think would be locked with
[1:54:52.040 --> 1:54:58.280]  99 of our government in there right but but that opens right up and what that is it was actually
[1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:03.000]  it was wetwall access to a tunnel that accessed the building's wetwall for maintenance and they
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:07.240]  start pulling things out of that tunnel like two by fours and god knows what else because i didn't
[1:55:07.240 --> 1:55:11.720]  stick around there right i marched on up to the top of the west here where they were letting
[1:55:11.720 --> 1:55:15.880]  everybody in and i walked in through open doors and when the police said leave i walked out through
[1:55:15.880 --> 1:55:24.360]  open doors and i come home right come home and my daughter she's extremely lip she just every
[1:55:24.360 --> 1:55:30.040]  weekend she comes over for no other reason than to break until of course the four or five months
[1:55:30.040 --> 1:55:35.800]  later and i'm arrested and she won't talk to me at all won't let me see my grandkids this goes on

[2:00:45.960 --> 2:00:49.800]  i get to my point i'd like to just ask you quickly about the art that you do do you think you might
[2:00:49.800 --> 2:00:55.080]  be doing gonzo journalism you know your your phone's a little muffled you said something about
[2:00:55.080 --> 2:01:01.960]  gonzo journalism yeah do you think that you might be uh treading in those waters as far as being a
[2:01:01.960 --> 2:01:07.560]  gonzo journalist you can't help when you're the major news story everywhere to be gonzo journalists
[2:01:07.560 --> 2:01:11.080]  i don't think i'm treading i don't think i'm treading a gonzo journalist i think i've gone
[2:01:11.080 --> 2:01:17.720]  deeper than anybody else has i think it could be uh here's my point here it's about trump i have
[2:01:17.720 --> 2:01:22.200]  completely lost all faith in trump anymore i do not believe him i think it's a joke i think he's new
[2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:28.040]  world order and um i think he totally betrayed us i've actually called you about this before but i
[2:01:28.040 --> 2:01:32.040]  just want to just drill that home to you and i do you do you think it's possible that you could
[2:01:32.040 --> 2:01:40.120]  have been scyopt into uh supporting trump as as hardcore as you do well nobody's perfect i mean
[2:01:40.120 --> 2:01:43.800]  i didn't support hillary and i think trump did a lot of good but i'm upset with trump about the
[2:01:43.800 --> 2:01:50.120]  vaccine so i mean yeah i mean anything's possible i mean we are it seems like we're caught right
[2:01:50.920 --> 2:01:57.960]  dead in in the in the left right paradigm and and trump is he he didn't do anything to wake anybody
[2:01:57.960 --> 2:02:03.160]  up to the true like new world order plans and then he he backs the vaccine it's absolutely insane i
[2:02:03.160 --> 2:02:07.800]  don't think that's fair yeah he did back the poison vaccine that's true but he exposed the un pulled
[2:02:07.800 --> 2:02:12.040]  out of unasco pulled out of the who i don't think that's true jason i appreciate your call
[2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:17.080]  larry in arizona larry thanks for holding go ahead you're on here now how are you doing alex good
[2:02:17.080 --> 2:02:23.320]  man two things i just want to say uh one is the january six i think we should have been to our
[2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:26.520]  state capitals and did everything there the punishment if it would have been would have
[2:02:26.520 --> 2:02:31.880]  been less severe and we would have focused before the yeah we walked well they're afraid of a march
[2:02:31.880 --> 2:02:36.520]  on the capital because it just shows our numbers so they set us up but yeah we walked right into
[2:02:36.520 --> 2:02:41.560]  a trap but i'm saying else we should have went to our state capitals i heard that yeah that's what
[2:02:41.560 --> 2:02:46.600]  we should have done and those six states we got screwed in and number two is unfortunately the
[2:02:46.600 --> 2:02:51.240]  sandy hook thing you could have been correct a guy comes out of the house he's smiling and you wonder
[2:02:51.240 --> 2:02:55.800]  uh why is he smiling then he talks and his kids supposedly was killed i would have thought the
[2:02:55.800 --> 2:03:01.080]  same as you but juries sympathize with children and the other thing i want to say is is that
[2:03:01.080 --> 2:03:05.480]  there's two things there is life after death because i experienced it and there is extra
[2:03:05.480 --> 2:03:10.680]  terrestrial so those two things and when i have those things it affects me personally because
[2:03:10.680 --> 2:03:17.000]  i look at people differently and i think look at the whole situation you know so and it was nice
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:21.480]  seeing you in Nebraska walking along the road there and seeing that whole because you're a
[2:03:21.480 --> 2:03:26.120]  down-to-earth good person and i'm not a left-wing person but i love your show i love all the people
[2:03:26.120 --> 2:03:30.920]  there that do what you do but i hope to god you stay on the air but we need people to get more
[2:03:30.920 --> 2:03:36.840]  physical instead of just being lightweight we got to get off our knees and we got to fight because
[2:03:36.840 --> 2:03:42.600]  all things and all changes were done by fighting the revolutionary wars and all wars were because
[2:03:42.600 --> 2:03:48.280]  of fighting to get changed on these people when they see weakness in our party because we had
[2:03:48.280 --> 2:03:52.760]  weakness in the gop we need to get rid of the gop and we need to create a whole new party
[2:03:53.480 --> 2:03:58.520]  like we did the tea party but we got taken the IRS and everything else and i hear you larry i
[2:03:58.520 --> 2:04:02.760]  appreciate your call absolutely we're being politically persecuted because we're on the
[2:04:02.760 --> 2:04:09.480]  right path and politically people are waking up we are winning all right we got a special guest

[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:33.640]  ultra maga republican florida state representative anthony sabatini is trying to take right wing
[2:06:33.640 --> 2:06:39.800]  outrage one step further if it was up to me i would totally defund the fbi i'm anthony sabatini
[2:06:39.800 --> 2:06:44.680]  he's running for congress in florida's seventh district and has been making the rounds on far
[2:06:44.680 --> 2:06:52.840]  right media after writing a tweet saying sever all ties with doj immediately and any fbi agent
[2:06:52.840 --> 2:06:57.880]  conducting law enforcement functions outside the purview of our state should be arrested
[2:06:57.880 --> 2:07:04.040]  upon sight common sense because well because what they're doing is unlawful it's time to actually
[2:07:04.040 --> 2:07:08.600]  start protecting the rights of floridians under the tenth amendment and push back against a lawless
[2:07:08.600 --> 2:07:15.720]  federal government right now today in florida fbi agents are chasing down bank robbers organized
[2:07:15.720 --> 2:07:21.800]  criminals attacking cyber crime in this state helping local law enforcement yeah you don't
[2:07:21.800 --> 2:07:27.240]  think there's any value in that it's an illogical argument the fbi at this point is totally useless
[2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:33.480]  we need to defund it and let no idea what the value of the fbi is yes i do is a former president
[2:07:33.480 --> 2:07:39.000]  just above the law no matter what the fbi is not above the law if i'm saying they followed the law
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:44.360]  which they did to enter into that home should that just not be allowed the president the former
[2:07:44.360 --> 2:07:50.760]  president is above the law he's a political target he's being harassed by a lawless road agency that's
[2:07:50.760 --> 2:07:56.200]  not a lawless agency they spy on him they have no respect for him they hate the conservatives they
[2:07:56.200 --> 2:08:02.280]  hate the republicans wouldn't it be prudent to wait and see what the facts are before we are
[2:08:02.280 --> 2:08:08.760]  such a draconian statement we have enough facts the same fbi unit that created the russia gate
[2:08:08.760 --> 2:08:13.880]  hugs raided marlago and took his passports we're being vindicated they're being destroyed that's
[2:08:13.880 --> 2:08:21.560]  why they're so desperate anthony 17 member of the district 32 in central florida running for
[2:08:21.560 --> 2:08:27.720]  congress great to have you here 17 for congress dot com sir you've got the florids we go to break
[2:08:27.720 --> 2:08:33.800]  in eight minutes cnn was interrupting you what do you really want to say wow i gotta tell you that
[2:08:33.800 --> 2:08:39.320]  was a 12 minute clip alex they will whittle the down to what they thought was uh uh the best
[2:08:39.320 --> 2:08:43.560]  perspective from their angle but still i thought they were really fair i mean listen we need to
[2:08:43.560 --> 2:08:48.680]  completely shut down and defund the fbi we need to go back to the tenth amendment this state of
[2:08:48.680 --> 2:08:52.840]  florida you know we we we do some good things down here everybody here is about the important
[2:08:52.840 --> 2:08:57.000]  conservative reforms happen in florida we're not going far enough we need to go a lot further
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:09:03.480]  we need to stop the federal infiltration uh and and and just uh abuse of the right since
[2:09:03.480 --> 2:09:08.440]  start securing the rights of florida and so that means basically two things we need an emergency
[2:09:08.440 --> 2:09:12.760]  special session right now we need to do one thing that's very easy to do very common sense
[2:09:12.760 --> 2:09:16.520]  the left already did it when they started their sanctuary stuff in terms of their relationship
[2:09:16.520 --> 2:09:21.240]  with federal government but we on the right in the republican states need to cut all ties with
[2:09:21.240 --> 2:09:26.360]  federal law enforcement so-called law enforcement agencies we need to stop communicating with them
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:30.840]  no more task forces between sheriffs county cities tax collectors all these different
[2:09:30.840 --> 2:09:34.920]  political subdivisions of the state and of course our state law enforcement we need to have no
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:39.080]  relationship with them that's number one that's the easy thing number two is we need to actually
[2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:43.720]  pass a statute uh reaffirming the tenth amendment and declaring what they're doing totally and
[2:09:43.720 --> 2:09:49.400]  completely illegal and yes it means actually arresting federal law enforcement agents that want to
[2:09:49.400 --> 2:09:55.080]  violate the rights of people like president trump but not just him not just him the uh uh
[2:09:55.080 --> 2:09:59.800]  j6 defendants the various other people who've been targeted and harassed by lawless rogue
[2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:04.760]  administrative state agencies here in the state of florida and some might say well that sounds
[2:10:04.760 --> 2:10:09.320]  really bold or maybe even radical but let me tell you can that can those people really look at
[2:10:09.320 --> 2:10:14.280]  what's happening and say it's going to get better from here that if we you know we should we should
[2:10:14.280 --> 2:10:19.080]  cease you know or not do anything else because somehow this is the situation is going to
[2:10:19.080 --> 2:10:24.440]  alleviate itself it's going to get worse from here and so it's time for republican legislators
[2:10:24.440 --> 2:10:30.200]  to stand up and draw a line in the stand immediately so like i said number one cut all ties with the
[2:10:30.200 --> 2:10:35.480]  doj immediately but number two actually declare what they're doing illegally and start the process
[2:10:36.040 --> 2:10:39.480]  of fighting back against the federal government those are the two easiest things we need to do
[2:10:39.480 --> 2:10:44.360]  and necessary things because they are going to try to arrest Donald Trump they are going to label
[2:10:44.360 --> 2:10:49.960]  all political dissent illegal and come after us you know i just told a lady this morning at the
[2:10:49.960 --> 2:10:54.440]  voting booth i was outside waving and she said some of the stuff i'm pushing is a little too far
[2:10:54.440 --> 2:10:59.160]  right to her i said listen the last 50 years of american history is going to look like nothing like
[2:10:59.160 --> 2:11:03.960]  the next 50 years and until we start being honest about what's about to happen in this country
[2:11:03.960 --> 2:11:09.960]  we're in trouble and so that's that's what i'm pushing uh the cnn wanted a nice interview i gave
[2:11:09.960 --> 2:11:16.040]  that to them uh they they thought uh you know what i was saying was you know radical but guess what
[2:11:16.040 --> 2:11:20.600]  it's actually what a majority of people believe nobody wants the fbi anymore if we're gonna have
[2:11:20.600 --> 2:11:26.920]  a federal law enforcement agency or i'm sorry a law enforcement agency uh uh to stop interstate
[2:11:26.920 --> 2:11:32.840]  crimes let it be the attorneys general of various republican states coming together through a state
[2:11:32.840 --> 2:11:38.680]  by state compact to stop interstate crime of human trafficking drug drug interdiction the fbi doesn't
[2:11:38.680 --> 2:11:45.320]  care oh yeah where where are they on the collapsed southern border exactly any of the things that
[2:11:45.320 --> 2:11:50.360]  there's a wide consensus to stop in terms of interstate crimes they don't care about all they care
[2:11:50.360 --> 2:11:55.960]  about is you know faking a kidnapping aggression whitmer harassing president uh donald trump
[2:11:55.960 --> 2:12:01.880]  harassing school parents at school board meetings et cetera so this is this is their new focus anybody
[2:12:01.880 --> 2:12:07.160]  that wants to uh uh give them more money is an enemy of the people in my opinion you know we
[2:12:07.160 --> 2:12:12.840]  heard the republican leadership and hearings on this we have to have very important hearings on
[2:12:12.840 --> 2:12:18.200]  this next year uh no we need to begin with defunding them and and using the power of the
[2:12:18.200 --> 2:12:23.400]  purse by taking weather power and then you have the hearings do the hearings afterward and i said
[2:12:23.400 --> 2:12:28.200]  a lot of what i just said alex uh to the scene and reporter but as you can as you know not all
[2:12:28.200 --> 2:12:33.320]  of that uh made it into the final cut so that's why representative anthony sabatini we've got
[2:12:33.320 --> 2:12:37.880]  you on so you can't be censored but since you mentioned uh governor dissonance here he is
[2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:43.080]  talking about the same topic he's being horrified these agencies have now been weaponized to be
[2:12:43.080 --> 2:12:48.840]  used against people that the government doesn't like and you look at the raid at mora lago
[2:12:49.400 --> 2:12:54.440]  and i'm just trying to i'm trying to remember maybe someone here can remind me about when
[2:12:54.440 --> 2:13:00.440]  they did a search warrant at hillary's house in chapaqua when she had a rogue server and she
[2:13:00.440 --> 2:13:05.880]  was laundering classified information i don't remember them doing that i do remember them
[2:13:05.880 --> 2:13:13.400]  manufacturing a false conspiracy theory about russia collusion i remember that that was not
[2:13:13.400 --> 2:13:19.800]  true that was an abuse of power i remember a lawyer for the fbi got caught doctoring an
[2:13:19.800 --> 2:13:26.840]  application for faiza surveillance against an innocent man i remember the fbi at merrick garland's
[2:13:26.840 --> 2:13:36.440]  direction being sicked on parents going to school board meetings meanwhile when you have a law that
[2:13:36.440 --> 2:13:42.440]  protects supreme court justices is the fbi out there protecting our conservative justices no
[2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:49.160]  when you have violations of law where people are targeting pregnancy crisis centers are
[2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:55.880]  they doing their job and enforcing the law there no they're enforcing the law based on
[2:13:55.880 --> 2:14:03.400]  who they like and who they don't like that is not a republic well maybe it's a banana republic
[2:14:03.400 --> 2:14:09.800]  when that happened the fbi's politically run we know that they're destroying themselves where
[2:14:09.800 --> 2:14:15.960]  do you see this going from here we need commitment from all candidates and sitting republicans in
[2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:20.440]  the federal congress but to defund them you know we talked a little bit in the last segment about
[2:14:20.440 --> 2:14:24.200]  what the state can do what we as the legislators can do which is a whole lot more than what we're
[2:14:24.200 --> 2:14:29.400]  doing but in congress what we need to do is a commitment from our leadership to totally and
[2:14:29.400 --> 2:14:33.400]  completely defund them if you're not doing that you're funding tyranny for the folks who say well
[2:14:33.400 --> 2:14:37.560]  there's a few crimes that they're investigating that are good for good for everybody well guess
[2:14:37.560 --> 2:14:41.800]  why that's what that's what a state attorney's general or for and we need interstate compacts
[2:14:41.800 --> 2:14:45.800]  for that we don't need federal law enforcement you know they were it was created in a sort of
[2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:50.840]  pre-technology pre-mass communication age we're not living the area more they're unnecessary
[2:14:50.840 --> 2:14:55.640]  I mean now they've they've extincted themselves they've committed political suicide they've made
[2:14:55.640 --> 2:15:01.640]  themselves political commissars at the old Soviet Union exactly I think that's probably the best
[2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:06.680]  description of them and so no more weakness in the republican party if they if they can't
[2:15:06.680 --> 2:15:11.160]  commit to stopping the tyranny we have within our borders they're not working for us they're
[2:15:11.160 --> 2:15:15.800]  working against us so this is what needs to happen next and like I said you know right now we need
[2:15:15.800 --> 2:15:20.040]  people to pledge I guess I made the news because I'm one of the few people that's willing to say
[2:15:20.040 --> 2:15:24.120]  I would never vote for a budget that continues to fund them especially at the levels they are now
[2:15:24.120 --> 2:15:27.880]  but it's time to start whittling away at their power statutory power but the best thing we can
[2:15:27.880 --> 2:15:32.840]  do initially is defunding them representative Anthony Sabantini stay right there you're running
[2:15:32.840 --> 2:15:37.400]  for congress you're warning the left trying to start a civil war I want to hear from you on that
[2:15:37.400 --> 2:15:42.040]  on the other side and how do we stop it because we're politically culturally winning they want
[2:15:42.040 --> 2:15:47.320]  a war how do we stop a physical war you know they're trying to hatch more Whitmer type kidnapping
[2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:50.600]  plots but we're here exposing them we'll be right back stay with us

[2:21:20.280 --> 2:21:25.800]  anthony avatini is a member of the representatives in florida representative district 32 he's
[2:21:25.800 --> 2:21:30.680]  running for congress i want to talk about that some next segment but let's talk about civil war
[2:21:30.680 --> 2:21:37.000]  not just within the gop which is a big problem and people are waking up the establishment
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:42.280]  also the democrats are trying to start civil war itself to politically overturn the chess
[2:21:42.280 --> 2:21:48.600]  board and then the marlago raid please continue absolutely i think we're in the midst of it
[2:21:48.600 --> 2:21:53.080]  we're probably uh you know somewhere in the middle of it i mean they started a civil war it's not a
[2:21:53.080 --> 2:21:57.560]  cold civil war sometimes you hear that phrase we're in a sort of cold domestic civil war it's
[2:21:57.560 --> 2:22:02.520]  definitely a hot war january 6 was the first attempt at sort of moving the overton window
[2:22:02.520 --> 2:22:08.520]  and normalizing the idea of getting americans to think that a large percent of our fellow
[2:22:08.520 --> 2:22:14.200]  citizens are domestic terrorists and they hate us and they're trying to destroy our democracy you
[2:22:14.200 --> 2:22:20.760]  see these key phrases being passed around and you know used in mass and in unison so uh you know
[2:22:20.760 --> 2:22:25.880]  that was 18 months ago uh where we're now at a point now where uh obviously democrats are
[2:22:25.880 --> 2:22:30.600]  pretty openly speaking about the fact that the republican party is a dissident party and should
[2:22:30.600 --> 2:22:35.400]  be treated as second class citizens oh they now say about me and everybody we should be outlawed
[2:22:35.400 --> 2:22:42.600]  for running for office outlawed for being on air they sound like the nkvd in 1935 russia i mean
[2:22:42.600 --> 2:22:49.800]  they are bona fide tyrants correct you know they came up with uh new rules and it's been mastered
[2:22:49.800 --> 2:22:56.120]  should be through uh their institutions mostly you know mass media and mass communication the idea
[2:22:56.120 --> 2:23:00.920]  that some americans aren't really americans and they should be treated completely and totally
[2:23:00.920 --> 2:23:06.200]  different so we're in it right now i mean they still control all their institutions that's why
[2:23:06.200 --> 2:23:10.360]  at this point they're really getting ready to expand on the federal gun control you know they
[2:23:10.360 --> 2:23:14.840]  got there they got a foothold a few months ago and they want to push a little bit further i think now
[2:23:14.840 --> 2:23:19.720]  uh just to make it a little bit more a little bit more aggressive uh so we're going to be seeing
[2:23:19.720 --> 2:23:25.800]  that pretty soon here and that's why republicans need to be honest and use plain language about
[2:23:25.800 --> 2:23:30.760]  what we're facing what we're up against they're not doing that right now they continue to talk
[2:23:30.760 --> 2:23:36.040]  i mean you look at what kevin mccarthy this guy who god forbid was ever became the speaker of the
[2:23:36.040 --> 2:23:42.040]  house what he laid out is his top priorities for the republican congress if the republicans took
[2:23:42.040 --> 2:23:47.160]  over in a few months and it's the most pathetic thing i've ever seen it was like a document from
[2:23:47.800 --> 2:23:52.520]  you know written by the heritage foundation in like the 1980s it's so outdated they don't understand
[2:23:52.520 --> 2:23:56.920]  the threats that we're facing they don't understand the posture that the left is in now within this
[2:23:56.920 --> 2:24:03.800]  country and they're not talking about the existential war near war that we're well that's right i mean
[2:24:03.800 --> 2:24:09.160]  the left says they want to outlaw the republican party basically and you've got a bunch of white flag
[2:24:09.160 --> 2:24:13.880]  waving compromised people like kevin mccarthy but you say don't understand i think they do understand
[2:24:15.480 --> 2:24:19.640]  yeah they do you're right and they're messaging something else but i will say some are dumb enough
[2:24:19.640 --> 2:24:24.840]  that they just they don't know what time it is they don't know the mode that we're in and what the
[2:24:24.840 --> 2:24:28.680]  left is planning to do i mean listen as soon as the republicans take the house they're gonna
[2:24:28.680 --> 2:24:33.240]  blame us for all their domestic issues and lord knows what kind of license they're gonna try to
[2:24:33.240 --> 2:24:38.520]  award themselves for stripping us of our rights but no i don't agree with something like this people are
[2:24:38.520 --> 2:24:43.560]  saying the marlboro ray blew up their face i think it is so why would they so boldly do this
[2:24:43.560 --> 2:24:49.000]  when it's on record that obama has 30 million records and that a president can trump pun intended
[2:24:49.640 --> 2:24:55.400]  what the national archive says so why have they tried this i think because it's obviously that
[2:24:55.400 --> 2:24:59.080]  down trump is gonna run for president again he's getting ready to announce in a few months and
[2:24:59.080 --> 2:25:03.480]  they wanted to keep this in proximity to his announcement i mean let's be honest they knew
[2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:08.600]  they knew probably a year ago what documents that they were gonna falsely claim were he told him and
[2:25:08.600 --> 2:25:14.040]  he told him i took exactly so so what they they're waiting for is listen there was talk about
[2:25:14.040 --> 2:25:18.840]  down trump announcing right before a majority of the primary midterm elections were held some
[2:25:18.840 --> 2:25:24.200]  say it's gonna be right after some say it's gonna be in the spring but it was chatter was occurring
[2:25:24.200 --> 2:25:29.320]  that it was going to be very very soon and so that's why this occurred when it did you know
[2:25:29.320 --> 2:25:35.720]  this is about this is about sort of overshadowing or throwing cold water on president trumps the
[2:25:35.720 --> 2:25:40.200]  chief domestic opponent of domestic political opponent of joe bine throwing cold water on
[2:25:40.200 --> 2:25:44.920]  his political aspirations and so the timing is no good now i totally agree uh state rep from
[2:25:44.920 --> 2:25:49.960]  florida anthony 17 he calling for the fbi to be abolished making national headlines what about
[2:25:49.960 --> 2:25:56.200]  the fact though that okay he pushed warp speed he got lied to bolas sonaro apologize that he was
[2:25:56.200 --> 2:26:00.760]  for the vaccines at first he's absolved himself i i really think as we learn these things don't
[2:26:00.760 --> 2:26:05.640]  work they've got serious side effects that trump needs to decouple himself from the shots that's
[2:26:05.640 --> 2:26:13.080]  his biggest problem with the grassroots 100 agree i've actually spoken to don trump about this uh
[2:26:13.080 --> 2:26:17.320]  you know listen he was in the fog of war you know he was getting hit every day saying that listen
[2:26:17.320 --> 2:26:22.600]  this is the remedy this is the fit this is huge let's just let's just record skip sound i'm gonna
[2:26:22.600 --> 2:26:27.480]  try to shut up start over you've talked to trump about this a lot of other people have to tell us
[2:26:27.480 --> 2:26:32.360]  about that and then go through it yeah one of the first conversations i had with donald trump when
[2:26:32.360 --> 2:26:37.640]  he brought me down to mara lago and i had a 90 minute conversation with him with just one other
[2:26:37.640 --> 2:26:43.240]  congressman my wife and and donald trump was about the vaccine and listen you know he he
[2:26:43.240 --> 2:26:47.720]  at the time you know people were dying they was he was getting bad information they were basically
[2:26:47.720 --> 2:26:52.200]  saying if you push this vaccine it's gonna solve all the world's problems you know fast forward
[2:26:52.200 --> 2:26:56.760]  more people died of covid after the vaccine was created then then sure they said we can in the
[2:26:56.760 --> 2:27:02.680]  lockdowns if you just do this and he believed him exactly that was it fog of war uh you're in
[2:27:02.680 --> 2:27:07.080]  the middle of an election you got people on your own team who fooled you and you know they
[2:27:07.080 --> 2:27:11.560]  fooled us into thinking that they were for us that they were maga they weren't he was surrounded
[2:27:11.560 --> 2:27:16.520]  on all sides and so that that's what was being pushed well fast forward like you know this is an
[2:27:16.520 --> 2:27:21.240]  actual fact more people died after the production of the vaccine than before from covid so what
[2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:25.640]  does that tell you and once that happened that's when i think people started to realize and you
[2:27:25.640 --> 2:27:30.920]  know one thing i liked about donald trump is he listens right he is a a populist and in the
[2:27:30.920 --> 2:27:35.000]  traditional sense of the story right he's gone from pushing it to shutting up about it at least
[2:27:35.880 --> 2:27:40.840]  yeah i mean well people are pushing it and uh guess what they're not pushing it as much anymore
[2:27:40.840 --> 2:27:45.400]  are they and the people pushing are the ones saying hey actually uh we were misled on this whole
[2:27:45.400 --> 2:27:51.720]  thing well don't you agree then he should decouple like bolson aro i do i do i do believe that obviously
[2:27:51.720 --> 2:27:56.600]  i mean i was the guy that actually pushed to get rid of florida's mandate uh statutory power to do
[2:27:56.600 --> 2:28:03.400]  vaccines we also pushed and had a lot pushed into law and just to sign a law that didn't go as far as
[2:28:03.400 --> 2:28:07.880]  i wanted it to but was the first and boldest law in the nation to stop private sector companies
[2:28:07.880 --> 2:28:11.240]  from mandating vaccines for employment no i knew that i should have said that anthony

[2:32:13.720 --> 2:32:19.480]  almost all of them just screw you over especially the big firms and the big tax groups because
[2:32:19.480 --> 2:32:23.480]  they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing
[2:32:23.480 --> 2:32:28.200]  this show it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting

[2:32:54.120 --> 2:33:04.200]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:33:12.360 --> 2:33:18.680]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[2:33:18.680 --> 2:33:27.240]  i'm just an average man i'm not a victim i'm a fighter and that's why i'm under attack
[2:33:28.760 --> 2:33:34.440]  here's a little real world example atlantic monthly run by the jeffrey ebbstein crowd
[2:33:35.720 --> 2:33:40.280]  called for my arrest and so the only way to stop jones is people keep backing him it's just to go
[2:33:40.280 --> 2:33:45.240]  ahead and indict him somehow and believe me it's been in the news they've had plenty of grand juries
[2:33:45.240 --> 2:33:49.080]  they tried to get to do it but they found no fault with me because i'm a pretty
[2:33:49.080 --> 2:33:55.640]  straight-laced clean-cut guy but oan shroyer isn't hosting today three to six p.m christy leo does a
[2:33:55.640 --> 2:34:01.160]  great job is darin beatty of revolver news with huge january 6 martial law developments of the
[2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:07.160]  ray ebb's is going to be hosting three to six p.m why isn't oan here he's in federal court
[2:34:07.160 --> 2:34:11.480]  he was with me on january six tried to stop people going to the capital they indicted him
[2:34:11.480 --> 2:34:18.920]  he's facing years in prison why didn't they indict me well because i was there opening the bullhorn
[2:34:18.920 --> 2:34:23.960]  trying to stop it oan was right there with me he did it too but it's a threat it's a message to me
[2:34:25.720 --> 2:34:31.720]  in fact they told us meet with us talk to us we'll drop the charges on oan
[2:34:33.400 --> 2:34:38.200]  i said to oan you want me to meet with him for you and he said no don't they want to put me in
[2:34:38.200 --> 2:34:44.120]  prison do it don't don't meet with him that's the type of people i work with and let me tell you
[2:34:44.120 --> 2:34:48.840]  something as a man it's a real honor to be around badasses like oan because i told him
[2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:55.240]  i said i'll meet with him i'll give him my phone which has nothing on it
[2:34:56.600 --> 2:35:02.600]  they'll drop the charges you said don't do it so they lie and say in my civil trial we they had
[2:35:02.600 --> 2:35:07.160]  my phone people say you better be mad at your lawyer they don't have my phone seeing it quietly
[2:35:07.160 --> 2:35:13.960]  last week admitted they don't have it it's all a lie but as mark twain said a lie goes halfway
[2:35:13.960 --> 2:35:19.160]  around the world where the truth puts its pants on but at the end of the day the truth almost always
[2:35:19.160 --> 2:35:23.560]  outs if good men and women stand firm and keep telling the truth so anthony sabbatini is a state
[2:35:23.560 --> 2:35:27.960]  rep in florida that's so much to fight the tyranny and the force in jackson's now he's running for
[2:35:27.960 --> 2:35:36.280]  congress speaking about where we are as a man and as a patriot big picture about where america and the
[2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:41.160]  world is right now and then why you're running for congress and and why folks should get behind you
[2:35:43.160 --> 2:35:48.760]  well quite literally freedom is under attack and it's almost gone you know most of human history
[2:35:48.760 --> 2:35:53.240]  we've lived in sort of feudalistic type eras freedom is very rare republics are very rare
[2:35:53.240 --> 2:35:57.960]  usually they fail immediately we've been lucky enough to live in republic that's lasted over 240
[2:35:57.960 --> 2:36:03.480]  years if we're going to refresh it and keep it going we need bold men and women of courage to
[2:36:03.480 --> 2:36:07.960]  stand up and fight that means me knowing what the constitution is knowing the foundation of this
[2:36:07.960 --> 2:36:12.840]  country which i believe is biblical principles and the founding fathers lessons which are embedded
[2:36:12.840 --> 2:36:17.160]  in the declaration of independence in congress and constitution everything else is nonsense
[2:36:17.160 --> 2:36:21.640]  everything else is noise everything else is secondary we need people who understand the
[2:36:21.640 --> 2:36:27.640]  meaning of this country and how rare the gift that we have which is freedom is and stand up and
[2:36:27.640 --> 2:36:31.640]  protect it and i've proven that at the state level and i don't care what the threats to it are i
[2:36:31.640 --> 2:36:36.440]  don't care how many times i've been attacked for it i know what the stakes are and i'm 33 okay
[2:36:36.440 --> 2:36:40.600]  hopefully i last another 50 years i don't want to be a serve i don't want to be a slave i don't
[2:36:40.600 --> 2:36:45.160]  want to live in a country where i am a second-class citizen and i will fight like hell to protect what
[2:36:45.160 --> 2:36:52.760]  we have here and what we've been given you've got six minutes to break give us a speech
[2:36:54.920 --> 2:36:59.800]  well manthony sabbatini you know i'm republican it's been great to be here for the last uh
[2:36:59.800 --> 2:37:03.720]  four years in the state legislature a lot of the bold conservative forms florida's kind of got
[2:37:03.720 --> 2:37:08.760]  noticed for have been things i've worked on and things i can hopefully they continue to try to take
[2:37:08.760 --> 2:37:13.560]  to the uh to congress you know some of the biggest threats in this country isn't just government
[2:37:13.560 --> 2:37:18.840]  but it's coming from the private sector this wokeness this transgender phenomenon and agenda
[2:37:18.840 --> 2:37:24.920]  this critical race theory that we're seeing is coming into the private sector we need bold new
[2:37:24.920 --> 2:37:30.280]  right style or conservatives who are going to pass laws to stop the corporate wokeism the
[2:37:30.280 --> 2:37:35.880]  fascism the sort of corporate fascism that is now pushing the left's agenda even with even more
[2:37:35.880 --> 2:37:41.080]  efficiency and alacrity than government can even do and so that's sort of the biggest division
[2:37:41.080 --> 2:37:45.720]  within the republican gop right now it's one of the reasons i'm running uh you know we need to
[2:37:45.720 --> 2:37:50.520]  basically come up with it you know to to go back to what we spoke about in the last segment
[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:55.320]  we need to go back to medical freedom we need a person's bill of rights at the federal level
[2:37:55.320 --> 2:38:01.560]  we need to bring back lawsuits against invalid vaccine manufacturers who are putting us in harm
[2:38:01.560 --> 2:38:06.040]  we can do that and we can come up with rights that people are given that protect us from the
[2:38:06.040 --> 2:38:10.760]  corporate leftist fascism as long along with state and federal government mandates that are
[2:38:10.760 --> 2:38:15.320]  being pushed on the throats of people in blue states in particular and so that's one of the
[2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:19.800]  reasons i'm running i'm i'm proud of a lot of the endorsements i've gotten from people like rand paul
[2:38:19.800 --> 2:38:24.840]  and marjorie taylor grain people had i think who were standing up for freedom coast to coast uh have
[2:38:24.840 --> 2:38:30.040]  entered into this race to help me you know we've raised a lot of money in the race raised 1.2 million
[2:38:30.040 --> 2:38:35.720]  not one penny from a lobbyist every single dime has come from 8 000 patriots coast to coast who
[2:38:35.720 --> 2:38:40.360]  remembered the fight that i fought for here in the great state of florida i'm an attorney you know
[2:38:40.360 --> 2:38:44.120]  when the state legislature in the beginning of covid wasn't really fighting and standing up for
[2:38:44.120 --> 2:38:49.640]  rights i decided to take it to the courtroom i sued 14 cities and counties that had mask mandates
[2:38:49.640 --> 2:38:54.200]  uh all around the state of florida and we had some success with those and we but at the end
[2:38:54.200 --> 2:38:59.720]  of the day we were able to move the window on that and put pressure on republicans to stand up
[2:38:59.720 --> 2:39:03.480]  against the medical tyranny that was taking over during the beginning of covid and
[2:39:03.480 --> 2:39:08.040]  ultimately we're very successful so i'm proud of the record that i've had and that's what i'm
[2:39:08.040 --> 2:39:12.280]  running on that's why we're taking that to the federal level and uh in congress i'm going to be
[2:39:12.280 --> 2:39:16.920]  a member of the freedom caucus and i will be fighting to try to get leadership in the republican
[2:39:16.920 --> 2:39:21.560]  party that understands the threat understands first of all the nature of the left which is a
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:27.720]  villainous sick communist anti-american hateful movement and then number two understands what
[2:39:27.720 --> 2:39:31.640]  we need to do in the face of it you know the hardest thing to do in politics right now
[2:39:31.640 --> 2:39:38.280]  is get conservatives to get rid of the defensive mindset and defensive language that's embedded
[2:39:38.280 --> 2:39:43.640]  in our culture i mean even the word conservative is a defensive posture it's time to conserve we
[2:39:43.640 --> 2:39:49.000]  need people who are good at conserve things folks we already lost so much of what happens we need
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:54.040]  a counter revolutionary movement that's going to go on offense and get our rights back and stand up
[2:39:54.040 --> 2:40:00.360]  for the foundational concepts of of america not playing defense why would you play defense when
[2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:05.240]  you're down 50 points in the game doesn't make any sense so that's one of the biggest things i'm
[2:40:05.240 --> 2:40:11.240]  really running on is moving the overton window going back to real conservatism real americanism
[2:40:11.240 --> 2:40:16.040]  and protecting freedom you know and like i said i'm not running on rhetoric i'm running on a record
[2:40:16.040 --> 2:40:20.040]  i mean google me every fight that has made florida famous and the things that are animating the
[2:40:20.040 --> 2:40:24.520]  republican party right now the maga movement are things i've been deeply deeply deeply involved in
[2:40:24.520 --> 2:40:29.160]  and my wife has been involved and we're both very involved in state local politics here and in the
[2:40:29.160 --> 2:40:34.840]  state party trying to get republicans to begin fighting again no more weakness within the party
[2:40:34.840 --> 2:40:40.440]  no more sitting back and playing defense i mean like i said earlier in the segment i looked at
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:44.440]  what the so-called leadership of the public a party had rolled out from when we take over the
[2:40:44.440 --> 2:40:50.040]  house in the spring and it was pathetic it was like talking about like expanding the sba the
[2:40:50.040 --> 2:40:55.160]  small business administration and these various little like niche items that i mean not nothing
[2:40:55.160 --> 2:41:00.760]  i'm opposed to but certainly not anything that has to do with facing down the threat uh the very
[2:41:00.760 --> 2:41:05.400]  near expulsion of liberty that we're looking at the republican party has been deliberately defanged
[2:41:05.400 --> 2:41:09.960]  by the leadership and you and others are trailblazers to change that you're one of the heart
[2:41:09.960 --> 2:41:14.360]  of the matter the reason we've had so much success in florida is you that's what we've got to get
[2:41:14.360 --> 2:41:20.840]  you in congress it's super exciting well i really appreciate that and that's why it's great to be
[2:41:20.840 --> 2:41:25.320]  on the show that's what i'm going to be fighting for and listen you know i i think you know this
[2:41:25.320 --> 2:41:29.560]  is a controversial item on the right i think we need to impeach joe biden and kamala harris and
[2:41:29.560 --> 2:41:32.600]  some folks would say well i don't know if we're going to have the votes in the senate for that so
[2:41:32.600 --> 2:41:38.440]  why even do it folks we have to stop normalizing the behavior of the left if the president violates
[2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:43.720]  the constitution he has to be impeached if you make the focus all his crimes and and totally
[2:41:43.720 --> 2:41:50.040]  shift onto them instead of them being on offense exactly exactly focus on the crimes the trial would
[2:41:50.040 --> 2:41:54.920]  bring so much light to what him and hunter have done but as importantly it's about standing
[2:41:54.920 --> 2:42:00.200]  up for the constitution that take care clause of the federal constitution has been deliberately
[2:42:00.200 --> 2:42:05.560]  violated he chose not purposely and this will come out with the impeachment hearings him in my
[2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:11.400]  orcas chose not to enforce our immigration laws not to uh have a border whatsoever they went in the
[2:42:11.400 --> 2:42:15.800]  opposite direction and did everything they could they took positive affirmative acts to make it
[2:42:15.800 --> 2:42:21.800]  easier to illegally they are at war with our country anthony 17 please join us again soon

[2:50:33.400 --> 2:50:38.280]  but there's something that you say that is infuriating it's wrong and misleading and it just
[2:50:38.280 --> 2:50:42.680]  beats into the destruction of humanity to the new world order and that is i'm not quoting you
[2:50:42.680 --> 2:50:48.600]  i'm paraphrasing god is hoping humanity fails god wants to crush us god is fed up with us and we
[2:50:48.600 --> 2:50:53.800]  deserve this okay this well you're misunderstanding what i say i'm saying if we don't step up god
[2:50:53.800 --> 2:50:59.720]  will allow us to be destroyed yeah but i've heard you say that god that god's fed up with us and we
[2:50:59.720 --> 2:51:05.480]  deserve this oh those those are no no no no no no no no i say adults that know about evil

[2:51:17.480 --> 2:51:23.160]  waiting for us to just stand so we can slap us around that satans lie and satans lie to separate
[2:51:23.160 --> 2:51:28.600]  us from god separate us from who we really are that's why he sent jesus to show us hey
[2:51:28.600 --> 2:51:35.080]  jesus is human but he stood up and said i'm directly connected with god just like you and
[2:51:35.080 --> 2:51:40.520]  they can do whatever they want to me and it's not going to hurt me and i totally agree with you so
[2:51:40.520 --> 2:51:45.160]  if you misunderstood me i apologize i'm a bad communicator i'm a center god's forgiven me

[2:51:50.120 --> 2:51:57.880]  there you go uh let's go to montine in georgia montine you're on the air hey alex i love your
[2:51:57.880 --> 2:52:06.200]  product number one number two i'm holding on my former formerly potstained fingers the crime
[2:52:06.200 --> 2:52:14.040]  statistics for canada kit for the year 2012 okay this is table eight this is a criminal justice
[2:52:14.040 --> 2:52:19.880]  information services division and i've sent this link to your show tips email i don't know how many
[2:52:19.880 --> 2:52:25.080]  times before your trial during your trial so anyway this canada kits that there's a lot of
[2:52:25.080 --> 2:52:31.880]  action going on in canada kit as far as crime goes so this is set up by city and if you scroll
[2:52:31.880 --> 2:52:35.800]  and it's only a page and a half because there's not the canada kits not that big so if you scroll
[2:52:35.800 --> 2:52:43.880]  all the way down on the first page the third from the bottom new town canada kit population 27904
[2:52:43.880 --> 2:52:51.480]  you hop over to the third column that's murder and non-negligent manslaughter zero for the year
[2:52:51.480 --> 2:52:57.320]  2012 i know and we reported that but if you read the fine print that we didn't see on the page we
[2:52:57.320 --> 2:53:02.280]  covered it says canada kit does not report statistics unlike other states but there were
[2:53:02.280 --> 2:53:09.080]  murders so that that's what they're saying i've seen that and why don't they you know this is the
[2:53:09.080 --> 2:53:13.800]  this is part of the fbi you know i say what you will but they are pretty good at counting things
[2:53:13.800 --> 2:53:19.000]  now if you look up paducah kentucky it's got those numbers no ma'am i understand i appreciate your
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:24.200]  call i gotta jump and we love you all i'm saying is this i barely covered sandy hook the media blows
[2:53:24.200 --> 2:53:29.560]  it up and says i'm the sandy hook man and i can't stop covering it it's all people bring up okay
[2:53:30.520 --> 2:53:36.040]  and so you understand they made it a big deal claiming i was making it a big deal to keep themselves
[2:53:36.040 --> 2:53:39.880]  in the news and gun control and now they're using it to go out to the first amendment and admitting
[2:53:39.880 --> 2:53:45.160]  they want to shut down all conservatives using these cases so regardless what really happened there
[2:53:45.160 --> 2:53:49.880]  they are using this to take our freedoms and they're admitting it and bragging about it
[2:53:49.880 --> 2:53:54.200]  ryan and dug i apologize i tried to get everybody we can't get to you call me back tomorrow
[2:53:54.200 --> 2:53:59.080]  you'll go to the head of the line roger stone's got a big fourth hour lined up ahead of the
[2:53:59.080 --> 2:54:05.320]  war room three p.m central so two to three p.m central roger stone on the fbi raid the latest
[2:54:05.320 --> 2:54:10.120]  and so much more roger great to have you here tell us what's coming up the next hour well
[2:54:10.120 --> 2:54:15.640]  alice we're going to break down the fbi raid we're going to talk about why the department of
[2:54:15.640 --> 2:54:21.880]  justice and the fbi want to hide the underlying affidavit which is the document that should have
[2:54:21.880 --> 2:54:27.720]  persuaded the magistrate whether to approve or disapprove the raid on trump's house and also
[2:54:27.720 --> 2:54:33.880]  joining us new york city police officer sal greco fired from the new york city police department
[2:54:33.880 --> 2:54:39.320]  despite an unblemished record of service to the people of new york simply because he's a friend
[2:54:39.320 --> 2:54:45.640]  of mine a watcher of info wars and a supporter of president dylan trump so that's the social
[2:54:45.640 --> 2:54:49.800]  credit score they already are doing to conservatives and patriots they plan to do everybody else
[2:54:50.920 --> 2:54:55.880]  absolutely it's going to be a great show what else do you make of all the insane news them having
[2:54:55.880 --> 2:55:02.200]  to return trump's passports well first of all let's recognize that i think that the deep state
[2:55:02.200 --> 2:55:07.880]  and their democratic allies or masters have figured out that they made a mistake and therefore
[2:55:07.880 --> 2:55:13.880]  there's a lot of backing and filling going on here uh trump had stolen nuclear codes no he hadn't
[2:55:13.880 --> 2:55:19.000]  trump was going to sell national security information to the chinese uh or the russians
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:24.680]  no he wasn't uh trump was going to flee the country because of his crimes no he isn't uh
[2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:31.560]  they are really in free fall they're in complete defensive mode it's almost fun to watch and by
[2:55:31.560 --> 2:55:35.640]  the way when we're in trouble we'll admit it we give bad news out all day i agree with you we're
[2:55:35.640 --> 2:55:39.480]  not just saying that they have screwed the pooch this is what up with their face they're even
[2:55:39.480 --> 2:55:44.440]  not calling in a raid now they're trying to back off saying oh what were they thinking
[2:55:44.440 --> 2:55:48.760]  everybody knows obama's got 30 million pages of stuff and he has a right as a former president
[2:55:50.440 --> 2:55:54.600]  i think they have a very distorted view of what the american people think and of course
[2:55:55.480 --> 2:56:00.200]  as a political scientist is someone who's a political i've been studying the polling numbers
[2:56:00.200 --> 2:56:06.360]  and i can tell you alex this has backfired big time uh there were people who voted for donald
[2:56:06.360 --> 2:56:12.920]  trump in 2016 2020 weren't sure that he was the right man in 2024 they are back in the fold
[2:56:12.920 --> 2:56:17.160]  there were people who were saying i'm just not going to vote the system is so broken
[2:56:17.160 --> 2:56:23.480]  they're back in the fold so i think they have fomented a political a political revolution
[2:56:23.480 --> 2:56:28.520]  well yeah we even have abc news saying it's our welly and it wasn't right we even have cnn host
[2:56:28.520 --> 2:56:33.640]  saying this shouldn't have happened they well how did they miscalculate i mean this is the
[2:56:33.640 --> 2:56:39.640]  i can tell them rating a former president is not going to go well i think that they're being driven
[2:56:39.640 --> 2:56:45.400]  by their own left wing so the left wing has a left wing of their own a radical progressive wing
[2:56:45.400 --> 2:56:51.800]  that is so vehement in their hatred of donald trump so desperate to destroy him so desperate to
[2:56:51.800 --> 2:56:59.000]  eliminate him as a presidential candidate that they have pushed the the the saner brains the saner
[2:56:59.560 --> 2:57:04.920]  strategists within their group to the edges yeah and first it was he hates all mexicans never said
[2:57:04.920 --> 2:57:09.640]  it then he's a russian agent stole the election never happened i mean just how many hoaxes have
[2:57:09.640 --> 2:57:16.360]  we now seen here that january 6 how many things have blown up in their face roger well it's because
[2:57:16.360 --> 2:57:22.280]  they lost to him in 2016 i believe they lost to him in 2020 and they cannot bear the idea
[2:57:22.280 --> 2:57:27.160]  that they may lose to him again all right roger stay there will be five more minutes then you take
[2:57:27.160 --> 2:57:33.480]  over for the balance of the fourth hour roger stone embattled former political president on
[2:57:33.480 --> 2:57:38.520]  the info war didn't back down when the fbi justice department threatened decades in president

[2:59:08.360 --> 2:59:16.440]  alternative facts do you understand what i have said yes i believe what i said was true so i don't
[2:59:16.440 --> 2:59:21.800]  guess you believe everything you say is true but it isn't your beliefs do not make something true
[2:59:21.800 --> 2:59:28.760]  that is that is what we're doing here there's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are

[2:59:44.360 --> 2:59:54.360]  war leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:00:06.760 --> 3:00:13.480]  well a true american political icon incredibly tested roger stone is here kind of one of my
[3:00:13.480 --> 3:00:16.520]  best friends roger about to take over for the rest of the hour with a special guest
[3:00:17.720 --> 3:00:22.040]  but i want to ask you this everybody what should trump do right now in the face of this
[3:00:22.760 --> 3:00:29.000]  brazen political assassination they just tried to engage in it and now they admit they grab cocktail
[3:00:29.000 --> 3:00:33.800]  napkins passports he said this five days ago they said he was lying now they admit turning cocktail
[3:00:33.800 --> 3:00:40.760]  napkins menus they return passports so so and and they're also so two questions in the four
[3:00:40.760 --> 3:00:45.880]  months we have left what should trump do now and you're one of his top local advisors a and then b
[3:00:45.880 --> 3:00:54.040]  why do they grab your pardon documents well first of all i think the president needs a tough
[3:00:54.040 --> 3:01:01.400]  experienced fearless criminal defense attorney these are very complicated issues the lawyers
[3:01:01.400 --> 3:01:06.600]  that were around him in the last two impeachments are gone many of them are witnesses against him
[3:01:06.600 --> 3:01:13.240]  in the january sixth proceedings i really think he needs a tough battle hardened uh attorney to
[3:01:13.240 --> 3:01:20.200]  represent him i also think that that that war councils breed defeat as general douglas macArthur
[3:01:20.200 --> 3:01:28.200]  said he needs to find one tough able courageous uh criminal attorney criminal law attorney and put
[3:01:28.200 --> 3:01:32.600]  that person in charge i don't know who's the orthodox to you i forget his name was the only
[3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:38.440]  good lawyer at an impeachment david shone would be excellent at this david shone represented
[3:01:39.160 --> 3:01:44.600]  steve bandon quite ably uh in that matter i believe he is the person who drafted steve's
[3:01:44.600 --> 3:01:49.560]  appeal he's a very very smart lawyer he would certainly be one i think the president should
[3:01:49.560 --> 3:01:55.720]  look at but above all he needs to put one guy in charge these are complicated issues as to your
[3:01:55.720 --> 3:02:02.120]  second question as to why they grabbed my pardon documents i guess the real question is why was
[3:02:02.120 --> 3:02:07.640]  the president holding on to them perhaps it was for sentimental reasons we have been friends for
[3:02:07.640 --> 3:02:13.720]  42 years it has been an article of faith on the left that roger stone had some kind of corrupt
[3:02:13.720 --> 3:02:19.880]  bargain with donald trump where he agreed to maintain his silence about non-existent misdeeds
[3:02:19.880 --> 3:02:27.400]  by the president in return for clemency that is bunk that is bs that is false so if they're thinking
[3:02:27.400 --> 3:02:34.280]  they can find some legal flaw uh in my clemency in the commutation of my sentence uh in my pardon
[3:02:34.280 --> 3:02:40.920]  well that's just wrong but you said literally a hundred times on my show i'm not getting a pardon
[3:02:40.920 --> 3:02:45.560]  for not tattling on trump because there's nothing to say he did nothing so you'd already nixed
[3:02:45.560 --> 3:02:52.200]  yourself out of being a stool pigeon and making stuff up with those statements well but see they
[3:02:52.200 --> 3:02:58.200]  don't want to to come forward and admit that the exact opposite is true i e they were pressuring me
[3:02:58.200 --> 3:03:06.440]  relentlessly to bear false witness against him which i refuse to do the hiding of this affidavit
[3:03:06.440 --> 3:03:11.960]  is extraordinary it's exactly the same thing they did with the mother report oh it's so explosive
[3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:16.760]  it's and contains so much national security information we can't let the american people
[3:03:16.760 --> 3:03:23.400]  see it and then when we finally saw it there was nothing there roger what are you gonna be covering
[3:03:23.400 --> 3:03:28.200]  i mean i know that your police officer a friend has been fired in persecuting you know he has a
[3:03:28.200 --> 3:03:33.320]  great record what else are you gonna be covering the next 55 minutes well we're gonna we're gonna
[3:03:33.320 --> 3:03:39.880]  talk more about the marlago raid we're gonna talk about the uh the midterm elections and the potential
[3:03:39.880 --> 3:03:45.480]  impact of them you notice you don't hear much about roe v wade these days isn't that miraculous
[3:03:45.480 --> 3:03:52.520]  why do you think in closing uh list chainie was done of the dead have her father endorse her when
[3:03:52.520 --> 3:03:58.760]  he's a criminal war criminal i mean the word word is she's gonna lose big tonight she is
[3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:03.800]  gonna lose big tonight but she is laying the groundwork for a challenge to president donald
[3:04:03.800 --> 3:04:08.680]  trump within the republican party so the rhinos are going to mount an effort to run their own
[3:04:08.680 --> 3:04:14.120]  candidate and she's going to be the candidate that's why they mail by the way tens of thousands
[3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:20.440]  of absentee ballots to democrats who didn't ask for them in an attempt to get them to vote for her
[3:04:20.440 --> 3:04:25.080]  not so she can win because she's going to get swamped but to run a strong race as possible
[3:04:25.080 --> 3:04:31.000]  as the underlying uh sure but doesn't that show how delusional they are that they think lives chainie
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:36.760]  is their secret weapon what a joke well what's delusional is they took a guy they hated more than
[3:04:36.760 --> 3:04:41.480]  anyone in the world dick chainie a guy who started a war for no reason whatsoever and
[3:04:41.480 --> 3:04:47.560]  crossed 150 000 lives and now they're deifying him because they hate don trump so damn much
[3:04:47.560 --> 3:04:51.880]  that's truly sick roger stone takes over get the book the great reset now signed

[3:06:23.560 --> 3:06:31.000]  have teed up gene autry singing back in the saddle again the entire crew at info wars are the very
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:39.800]  best people to work with uh you probably didn't see it or maybe you did this past thursday i had
[3:06:39.800 --> 3:06:47.320]  an opportunity to go on with my good friend shawn hannity uh because he recalls the horrific raid
[3:06:47.320 --> 3:06:57.880]  on my home you may remember uh that on the 25th of january 2019 29 heavily armed fbi agents
[3:06:57.880 --> 3:07:07.320]  stormed my home uh all of them swat clad uh brandishing fully automatic m4 assault weapons
[3:07:07.320 --> 3:07:16.360]  initially surrounding my house they arrived in 17 armored vehicles there was an fbi helicopter
[3:07:16.360 --> 3:07:22.840]  overhead and yes as shawn hannity loves to point out they pulled two amphibious units boats
[3:07:22.840 --> 3:07:30.920]  up to the dock behind my house and from men were jumping out on the dock also heavily armed this
[3:07:30.920 --> 3:07:39.160]  entire attack to arrest me this raid cost the american taxpayers 1.1 million dollars that's
[3:07:39.160 --> 3:07:44.920]  because the government was shut down at the time and every one of these agents was getting time and
[3:07:44.920 --> 3:07:53.800]  a half for overtime uh and of course the prosecutors had talked to my attorney the day before all they
[3:07:53.800 --> 3:08:00.360]  really needed to do was tell me to turn myself in uh so i had an opportunity to talk to shawn
[3:08:00.360 --> 3:08:09.080]  hannity about this on the air unfortunately fox cannot post that video to their youtube channel
[3:08:09.080 --> 3:08:17.160]  lest they be banned for life several weeks ago wabc in new york uh a mega radio station
[3:08:17.160 --> 3:08:24.040]  great folks there posted an interview that i did with uh frank morano only to have their page
[3:08:24.040 --> 3:08:31.400]  suspended to his credit my friend shawn hannity posted this video on his twitter page his facebook
[3:08:31.400 --> 3:08:38.680]  page his instagram page i put it rumble let's take a look if you're a republican you support
[3:08:38.680 --> 3:08:44.520]  president trump good luck because the fbi is watching your every move and you may even be on cnn
[3:08:44.520 --> 3:08:52.760]  fake news take a look the fbi agents you can see them in riot gear approached stone's house before
[3:08:52.760 --> 3:09:00.200]  sunrise at around six this morning they raided his home and they arrested roger stone here is a moment
[3:09:00.200 --> 3:09:13.720]  of that arrest
[3:09:20.040 --> 3:09:26.040]  that is roger stone being awoken by these fbi agents and i'd say riot gear it's actually
[3:09:26.040 --> 3:09:30.280]  just flat jackets they're wearing bulletproof vests one had a helmet on these are i mean
[3:09:30.280 --> 3:09:35.400]  they don't agents are aware that when they don't know what they're going to encounter and and it is
[3:09:35.400 --> 3:09:42.280]  just remarkable and to see this because this is not how anyone else connected to the robert
[3:09:42.280 --> 3:09:48.760]  moeller investigation has been arrested he experienced them experiences himself here to
[3:09:48.760 --> 3:09:54.600]  respond is roger stone um wow pretty interesting what you went through i'm sure that brings
[3:09:54.600 --> 3:09:59.640]  back very fond memories for you and your wife who by the way just survived stage four cancer thank
[3:09:59.640 --> 3:10:07.240]  god for that um let's talk about that day and let's talk about that morning and was there if
[3:10:07.240 --> 3:10:11.640]  they would have called your lawyer and said you needed to report at a certain time because you
[3:10:11.640 --> 3:10:17.240]  were going to be arrested would you have reported uh in fact the special counsel's office spoke to
[3:10:17.240 --> 3:10:23.000]  my lawyer on the phone the day before and i most certainly would have just turned myself in but
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:33.080]  at six a.m. 29 totally swat clad fbi agents arriving in 17 armored vehicles with a helicopter
[3:10:33.080 --> 3:10:40.200]  overhead two amphibious units dropping off frog frog men in the backyard all of them brandishing
[3:10:40.200 --> 3:10:47.320]  fully automatic m4 assault weapons stormed my home to arrest me for the first time nonviolent
[3:10:47.320 --> 3:10:53.400]  crime of lying to congress essentially also a fabricated crime because one cannot lie to congress
[3:10:53.400 --> 3:11:01.320]  about russian collusion when there is no russian collusion uh and uh it was a horrific experience
[3:11:02.360 --> 3:11:07.320]  air sea and land just like with the president why they had to go through all my wife's clothes
[3:11:07.320 --> 3:11:14.440]  they were in our house for 13 uh hours they found no evidence whatsoever against me and of course
[3:11:14.440 --> 3:11:20.440]  a year after president trump had both the courage and the strength to pardon me because he realized
[3:11:20.440 --> 3:11:29.240]  that i was the victim of a totally fabricated prosecution uh the on november 3rd 2020 at midnight
[3:11:29.240 --> 3:11:35.080]  strange time to put out a press release shone midnight on the busiest uh media day of the year
[3:11:35.080 --> 3:11:41.800]  robert moeller's final report was unredacted proving that he had found quote no factual basis
[3:11:41.800 --> 3:11:47.640]  to charge me with anything regarding russian collusion wiki leaks collaboration or involvement
[3:11:47.640 --> 3:11:55.240]  in the phishing or publication of donald trump's uh pardon me of john podesta's emails so the whole
[3:11:55.240 --> 3:12:02.680]  purpose of this raid was intimidation let's talk about it in relation to what happened to at mora
[3:12:02.680 --> 3:12:10.040]  lago this weekend and you know paul manifold you know peter monovarro and why this seems
[3:12:10.040 --> 3:12:15.080]  why these tactics are now being used more and more and why does it only seem to happen to
[3:12:15.080 --> 3:12:20.440]  conservatives nothing happened to hillary clinton nothing happened to the people that lied uh
[3:12:20.440 --> 3:12:27.160]  before fiza courts uh nothing happened to the the upper echelon and the fbi when they spread
[3:12:27.160 --> 3:12:32.920]  lies about uh russia collusion as you point out rightly so that never occurred uh they've had
[3:12:32.920 --> 3:12:38.280]  hundred biden's laptop we know there are crimes and evidence of crimes on that laptop nothing's
[3:12:38.280 --> 3:12:43.800]  happened to him why the double standard i'll give you the last word well first of all it's very
[3:12:43.800 --> 3:12:51.640]  important to recognize that i was arrested at 606 at 611 sarah murray with cnn texted a copy of my
[3:12:51.640 --> 3:12:59.000]  indictment to one of my lawyers that indictment was sealed until 9 30 that morning so just the
[3:12:59.000 --> 3:13:04.440]  leak of the indictment um was a felony and when you look at the metadata tags to figure out who
[3:13:04.440 --> 3:13:09.240]  wrote it because it had no court markings or timestamps on it while it had the initials of
[3:13:09.240 --> 3:13:15.000]  andrew weissman look if this was meant this raid in marlago was meant to intimidate donald trump
[3:13:15.000 --> 3:13:20.360]  they don't understand donald trump i work for president richard dixon i work for senator bob dole
[3:13:20.360 --> 3:13:26.040]  two of the toughest guys you can imagine donald trump is tougher than both of them that's why
[3:13:26.040 --> 3:13:37.160]  he was a great president it's also why he'll be a great president again once again my thanks to my
[3:13:37.160 --> 3:13:44.440]  good friend shone hannity for posting that on all of his social media also thanks to joe and
[3:13:44.440 --> 3:13:51.320]  jim hoff at the gateway pundit who posted it on their website along with the piece i wrote about
[3:13:51.320 --> 3:14:00.680]  the entire horrific experience why uh they seized the documents pertaining to my clemency well it's
[3:14:00.680 --> 3:14:07.800]  an odd question there's nothing irregular or illegal or improper about uh that entire process
[3:14:08.360 --> 3:14:18.840]  the truth is from the time that i was charged on january 25th uh 2019 uh up until the day the president
[3:14:18.840 --> 3:14:27.160]  called me over a year later to commute my sentence i had no contact whatsoever directly or indirectly
[3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:33.480]  with president trump neither his lawyers nor my lawyers would permit it nor did we have
[3:14:33.480 --> 3:14:41.320]  communications through third parties uh or through uh my attorneys so uh the idea that there was some
[3:14:41.320 --> 3:14:49.080]  corrupt bargain something that hillary clinton has just flatly said eric swalwell uh adam schiff
[3:14:49.640 --> 3:14:57.720]  hakeem jeffreys uh all of them claiming oh stone agreed to keep his mouth shut about
[3:14:57.720 --> 3:15:04.360]  unspecified and i should say non-existent missed deeds by donald trump in return for a pardon
[3:15:04.920 --> 3:15:11.160]  no i got a pardon because i got down to my knees and i prayed to jesus christ uh my lord
[3:15:11.160 --> 3:15:18.520]  and savior for justice uh there came a time as i think people know uh when it became very clear to
[3:15:18.520 --> 3:15:27.000]  me that i was not going to get a fair trial uh when i had a deeply biased and hateful judge
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:34.200]  who couldn't conceal her hatred for me or for donald trump uh and therefore i was redeemed in the
[3:15:34.200 --> 3:15:40.920]  blood of jesus christ which is why i am with you to be on this show and sit in for alex jones
[3:15:40.920 --> 3:15:48.040]  today uh coming back on the other side officer sal greco a 15-year veteran of the new york police

[3:21:54.280 --> 3:22:03.000]  my rock throughout she was there through every day of the trial she was there for every one of the
[3:22:03.000 --> 3:22:10.520]  days of the two years uh that we were vilified smeared there she is being led out of the house
[3:22:10.520 --> 3:22:17.240]  that is my beautiful wife there and i get mail text messages every day to ask me
[3:22:17.240 --> 3:22:24.040]  how she's doing i'm happy to report that based on the healing power of jesus christ
[3:22:24.600 --> 3:22:32.200]  and the power of prayer and through a combination of some western medicine but mostly alternative
[3:22:32.200 --> 3:22:42.600]  healing uh my sweet beautiful wife is now cancer free more than 120 days cancer free it is as the
[3:22:42.600 --> 3:22:49.560]  doctors themselves say a miracle so i thank all of the info warriors who have inquired as to how
[3:22:49.560 --> 3:22:56.760]  she's doing uh she's doing really great uh the uh at the same time we continue to have
[3:22:56.760 --> 3:23:09.160]  the unrelenting stress uh of 11 remaining uh totally harassment oriented uh civil suits against us
[3:23:09.160 --> 3:23:20.440]  filed by nutjobs pots leftists democrats oh wait i'm i'm being redundant uh this is what they call
[3:23:20.440 --> 3:23:27.560]  law fair that's when they file highly sensationalized civil lawsuits against you for the purpose of
[3:23:27.560 --> 3:23:34.920]  dragging your name through the mud yet again uh and running up giant legal fees uh and if you
[3:23:34.920 --> 3:23:42.280]  don't defend well as alex jones showed even when he did defend they file a default judgment against
[3:23:42.280 --> 3:23:48.600]  you uh you may have even seen stories uh that we recently reached an agreement with the uh
[3:23:48.600 --> 3:23:57.320]  department of justice uh in a civil suit regarding our 2006 taxes folks when you see the headline that
[3:23:57.320 --> 3:24:03.880]  says roger stone and his wife agree to pay the irs two million dollars well that's the amount they
[3:24:03.880 --> 3:24:09.800]  have assessed us that doesn't mean that we have the money today to pay them because we do not
[3:24:10.520 --> 3:24:17.080]  what they also don't tell you is that 70 percent of that amount is interest and penalty my taxes
[3:24:17.080 --> 3:24:25.080]  are up to date for every year from 2007 to the current time uh those taxes for the normal citizen
[3:24:25.080 --> 3:24:32.920]  would have been discharged or would have negotiated a a reduction uh in the interests or and penalty
[3:24:32.920 --> 3:24:39.480]  but i'm not your average person like alex jones i am a target and for the same reasons that alex
[3:24:39.480 --> 3:24:47.560]  jones is a target so folks who want to help us uh can go to the stone defense fund dot com
[3:24:47.560 --> 3:24:54.360]  stone defense fund dot com i'm going to be paying lawyers for the rest of my life but i have no
[3:24:54.360 --> 3:25:01.480]  intention of ever uh giving up in the fight for freedom and i never want to be censored again in
[3:25:01.480 --> 3:25:10.040]  terms of being gagged in my ability to speak so those who can help us god bless you for it your
[3:25:10.040 --> 3:25:18.920]  money will be put to good use i want to be very clear there is not a month uh in which the total
[3:25:18.920 --> 3:25:26.600]  of my legal expenses paying lawyers in our modest living expenses do not exceed the amount of money
[3:25:26.600 --> 3:25:33.880]  when combined with the unsure costs of my wife's continued uh health care uh in cancer treatment
[3:25:33.880 --> 3:25:40.920]  she's having some uh issues regarding edema because they had to remove certain lymph nodes under her
[3:25:40.920 --> 3:25:47.640]  arm so every month is a struggle no don't believe the daily beasts when they say the stones are
[3:25:47.640 --> 3:25:54.440]  living a lavish lifestyle i'm tired of being called a grifter because i have to appeal to my
[3:25:54.440 --> 3:26:01.320]  fellow americans for support but i really have no choice so if you want to help our family
[3:26:01.320 --> 3:26:09.560]  you can go to the the stonefamilyfund.com and your money believe me will be put to good use

[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:12.600]  department is now trying to destroy sal greco simply because he was in his off hours a supporter of

[3:33:16.760 --> 3:33:24.200]  are receiving this transmission you are the resistance and now your host roger stone
[3:33:28.360 --> 3:33:37.400]  welcome back i'm roger stone sitting in for my good friend alex jones some of you may have
[3:33:37.400 --> 3:33:45.080]  been watching the january 6 soap opera as staged by the us house of representatives democrats
[3:33:45.080 --> 3:33:54.440]  very much like the senate watergate hearings of decades ago it was a one-sided spectacularly
[3:33:54.440 --> 3:34:04.680]  produced television drama that was short on facts i thought it fairly shocking when for weeks
[3:34:04.680 --> 3:34:10.200]  adam schiff and others kept hyping that their hearings were going to demonstrate
[3:34:10.200 --> 3:34:18.920]  that roger stone and general michael flinn were the connection between the trump white house
[3:34:19.560 --> 3:34:28.680]  and certain extremist groups this is categorically false and then they produced a woman named
[3:34:28.680 --> 3:34:35.160]  cassidy hushinson who i've never met in my life and it was very interested in the way that her
[3:34:35.160 --> 3:34:45.320]  testimony was couched liz cheney the congresswoman from wyoming daughter of a war criminal who lied
[3:34:45.320 --> 3:34:54.520]  this nation into war by falsely claiming that iraq had some connection to the attacks on america
[3:34:54.520 --> 3:35:03.160]  on 9 11 and then falsely claimed that iraq had weapons of mass destruction specifically
[3:35:03.160 --> 3:35:12.840]  uh yellow cake uranium that they could convert to nuclear weapons this slide cost 150 000 american
[3:35:12.840 --> 3:35:22.120]  lives more than 200 000 iraqi lives and over nine billion dollars uh to the american taxpayers
[3:35:23.320 --> 3:35:30.920]  but liz cheney asked hushinson is it your understanding that president donald trump
[3:35:30.920 --> 3:35:39.800]  um directed his white house chief of staff mark meadows to call roger stone uh and general
[3:35:39.800 --> 3:35:48.840]  michael flinn uh on the afternoon of january 5th and hushinson said yes it is my understanding
[3:35:49.800 --> 3:35:56.520]  and that call was for the purposes of finding out what would happen on january 6th cheney said
[3:35:56.520 --> 3:36:04.200]  let me be very clear i've never talked to mark meadows on the phone in my life most certainly
[3:36:04.200 --> 3:36:10.760]  not on january 5th and i would have no idea what was going to happen on january 6th because i
[3:36:10.760 --> 3:36:19.240]  wasn't there and i never planned to go there i did go to washington dc uh to give a speech at a
[3:36:19.240 --> 3:36:28.360]  perfectly legal permitted event where alex jones also spoke uh and that video of my speech which
[3:36:28.360 --> 3:36:36.840]  has now been taken down by youtube is perfectly appropriate i did put forward my own apocalyptic
[3:36:36.840 --> 3:36:43.480]  view of the struggle facing the country based on my christian beliefs but nowhere in that video
[3:36:43.480 --> 3:36:52.600]  did i call for violence lawlessness or insurrection i'm a veteran of 40 years in american elective
[3:36:52.600 --> 3:37:01.240]  politics i believe in our system however broken uh and that we must succeed electorally that is uh
[3:37:01.240 --> 3:37:11.240]  always been my position with me that day however um was a friend sal greco who i referred to earlier
[3:37:11.240 --> 3:37:18.520]  in the broadcast sal greco is a veteran of the new york city police department with an
[3:37:18.520 --> 3:37:24.440]  unblemished record of service to the people of new york serving in some of the most dangerous
[3:37:24.440 --> 3:37:34.200]  precincts in the city uh sal greco was also not at the capital and sal greco is also not involved
[3:37:34.200 --> 3:37:42.360]  as i was not in any way in the efforts to delay the electoral college vote i certainly followed
[3:37:42.360 --> 3:37:49.640]  it in the media but i wasn't involved if there was a war room at the willard well i didn't know
[3:37:49.640 --> 3:37:57.400]  about it and i certainly never visited it either did officer greco but salvator greco has been the
[3:37:57.400 --> 3:38:04.680]  victim of another witch hunt shortly after he returned to new york city after january 6th
[3:38:04.680 --> 3:38:12.280]  he learned that administrative charges for termination had been filed against him and he went
[3:38:12.280 --> 3:38:19.800]  through the same kind of soviet style show trial that i did joining us now from statten island
[3:38:19.800 --> 3:38:29.800]  new york a proud son of new york city officer salvator greco good uh good afternoon ratchets
[3:38:29.800 --> 3:38:38.280]  pleasure to be here on info wars so sal um we sat through your trial they weren't very happy when
[3:38:38.280 --> 3:38:45.000]  i showed up just to be supportive but uh they are well aware of the fact that you had nothing to do
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:51.480]  with the illegal acts at the capital on january 6th uh and you're being you were terminated
[3:38:51.480 --> 3:38:58.200]  after a long administrative process when the new york city police commissioner essentially sat on
[3:38:58.200 --> 3:39:06.200]  a recommendation by an administrative judge uh that you be terminated uh your your livelihood
[3:39:06.200 --> 3:39:13.800]  has now been ended your pension uh and your access to your pension is in question but as i understand
[3:39:13.800 --> 3:39:21.240]  it you were fired for two reasons one they say uh that you violated a new york police department
[3:39:21.240 --> 3:39:29.160]  regulation which prohibits you from consorting with known convicted felons that would be me i guess
[3:39:29.160 --> 3:39:34.920]  the biden justice department thoughtfully sent a letter saying that an unconditional presidential
[3:39:34.920 --> 3:39:41.240]  pardon does not change one's technical legal status but also they say that you provided
[3:39:41.240 --> 3:39:49.560]  uncompensated security for me that's a new one is there such a thing under the nypd regulations
[3:39:51.080 --> 3:39:56.520]  uh to be honest with you i believe this is a whole new term uh created just for sal greco
[3:39:56.520 --> 3:40:04.520]  this uncompensated security uh you as you well know uh you you never have given me one dime
[3:40:04.520 --> 3:40:09.880]  and the only exchange of money that's ever occurred between the stone family and sal greco
[3:40:09.880 --> 3:40:19.880]  was the two times uh i came to see you once in i believe july of 2020 where it was nidia who said
[3:40:19.880 --> 3:40:25.480]  listen uh since you're staying at the hotel uh you know you've always treated me like family
[3:40:25.480 --> 3:40:31.960]  and she wanted me to stay and she offered to reimburse me for the hotel that was one instance
[3:40:31.960 --> 3:40:37.000]  and there was a second instance where i believe it was in october of 2020 when i came to visu
[3:40:37.000 --> 3:40:43.320]  you uh the car broke down the stone will be a broke down so i rented a vehicle and once again
[3:40:44.040 --> 3:40:49.640]  nidia was nice enough to say i'll reimburse you for that since uh the vehicle broke down and that's
[3:40:49.640 --> 3:40:56.360]  the only transactions that have ever occurred between uh you and your family and myself
[3:40:58.520 --> 3:41:06.760]  yet they say that you provided uncompensated security now it is true unfortunately as violence
[3:41:06.760 --> 3:41:13.640]  and public shaming become a new tactic of the radical and violent left yeah i do feel safer
[3:41:13.640 --> 3:41:20.280]  going someplace with a friend rather than going by myself but at no time was sal greco ever my
[3:41:20.280 --> 3:41:29.480]  formal security uh uh uh agent or guard he is a personal friend but the other charge which
[3:41:29.480 --> 3:41:36.200]  will talk about more on the other side that's more egregious is this idea uh that you were fired
[3:41:36.200 --> 3:41:44.360]  because you concerted with a known convicted felon mary aric adams the current woke progressive
[3:41:44.360 --> 3:41:50.840]  mayor of new york city writes in his book about providing paid security for mike tyson
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:57.640]  in for lewis ferrican both of them convicted felons he was also brought up on charges went
[3:41:57.640 --> 3:42:02.680]  through the same administrative process you did but there was no finding against him he wasn't
[3:42:02.680 --> 3:42:08.840]  terminated they didn't dock his pay they didn't take away vacation days and i argue this is an
[3:42:08.840 --> 3:42:16.680]  equal protection matter that sal greco must be treated the exact same way as new york city police
[3:42:16.680 --> 3:42:24.680]  captain eric adams and there in the crux is a 25 million dollar lawsuit against the new york
[3:42:24.680 --> 3:42:32.840]  police department uh that this officer is going to file uh this has been a long bloody drawn out
[3:42:34.040 --> 3:42:38.360]  struggle i want to talk a little bit about your father passing away in the middle of it
[3:42:38.360 --> 3:42:44.680]  because it's a heartbreaking story what nypd brass has done to you uh and americans need to know
[3:42:44.680 --> 3:42:51.480]  how they can help get in this fight so on the other side sal greco new york city police officer
[3:42:51.480 --> 3:42:58.520]  proud son of statten island one of my best friends joins us at info so many people over the years
[3:42:59.240 --> 3:43:04.760]  have walked up to me randomly on the street and said super male vitality is incredible

[3:47:30.120 --> 3:47:37.160]  good friend alex jones and we continue our interview with new york city police officer
[3:47:37.720 --> 3:47:45.800]  actually now former new york city police officer sal greco who only days ago was terminated
[3:47:45.800 --> 3:47:52.920]  by the woke progressives running the new york city police department officer greco let me ask
[3:47:52.920 --> 3:47:59.080]  you a few simple questions as an officer the law are you permitted to carry a firearm in
[3:47:59.080 --> 3:48:07.240]  jurisdictions other than new york oh you're allowed to carry in all 50 states uh and uh
[3:48:08.040 --> 3:48:14.200]  on your off hours when you're not on duty are you allowed to support president donald trump
[3:48:14.200 --> 3:48:22.600]  or attend a political event you should be able to but apparently that may not be the case
[3:48:22.600 --> 3:48:31.560]  uh in this particular case um i know that the prosecutor uh in this administrative trial
[3:48:32.120 --> 3:48:38.600]  sought your uh social media records uh and then sought your telephone records and that
[3:48:38.600 --> 3:48:45.080]  his initial subpoenas were denied because this is not a criminal proceeding this is not a
[3:48:45.080 --> 3:48:54.280]  court proceeding uh but then he refiled uh his requests falsely claiming that this was a narcotics
[3:48:54.280 --> 3:49:00.920]  investigation uh sal have you ever been tested for the use of narcotics by the new york police
[3:49:00.920 --> 3:49:07.400]  department uh no not not in this particular instance they obviously they can randomly uh
[3:49:07.400 --> 3:49:12.680]  dull test you but that they dull tested me about seven or eight years ago randomly as far as this
[3:49:12.680 --> 3:49:21.560]  case goes uh i was never uh dull tested nor apparently understand as you uh the uh sergeant
[3:49:21.560 --> 3:49:29.080]  mentioned that uh i was never suspected of narcotics use uh sal are you a member of the
[3:49:29.080 --> 3:49:37.480]  proud boys or the oath keepers uh absolutely not uh would it be fair to say that in our private
[3:49:37.480 --> 3:49:43.400]  conversations you've been pretty critical of both groups uh that would be correct yes
[3:49:44.760 --> 3:49:49.400]  so in essence i mean i sat in your trial they kept showing pictures of you and i
[3:49:49.400 --> 3:49:56.200]  with other people uh and i certainly acknowledge that i like you we've met members of the proud
[3:49:56.200 --> 3:50:02.600]  boys we came in contact with members of the oath keepers seems to me that that proves nothing
[3:50:02.600 --> 3:50:09.800]  whatsoever that's guilt by association if having my picture taken with a member of the oath keepers
[3:50:09.800 --> 3:50:15.960]  or the proud boys means i'm an insurrectionist well that means that congressman adam schiff
[3:50:15.960 --> 3:50:23.560]  having his picture taken with ed buck the multi-millionaire uh gay murderer who's now been
[3:50:23.560 --> 3:50:30.040]  convicted of killing young gay black men that means that adam schiff is a murderer uh it doesn't
[3:50:30.040 --> 3:50:36.120]  even it's not even logical but this is the technique that was used at your trial over and over again
[3:50:37.640 --> 3:50:43.400]  yes so also at the trial uh you were sitting right there how many times was jacob engels involved
[3:50:44.040 --> 3:50:48.520]  how many times did we hear his name being involved uh the jacob engels has never been
[3:50:49.560 --> 3:50:54.440]  accused of being a member of the proud boys he's obviously a journalist who actually works
[3:50:54.440 --> 3:51:01.160]  for info wars i believe this was i uh mentioned this in my when i was testifying and he also
[3:51:01.160 --> 3:51:06.600]  has worked for you he's never been convicted of anything he's not a felon if anything poor jacob
[3:51:06.600 --> 3:51:13.320]  engels has had a counters with people in the street but yet that didn't stop them from mentioning him
[3:51:13.320 --> 3:51:17.800]  almost as many times they mentioned your name and of course they've also mentioned president
[3:51:17.800 --> 3:51:25.960]  trump numerous times in this uh court proceeding so yeah it's just unbelievable that this entire
[3:51:25.960 --> 3:51:33.160]  trial took place now sal very sadly uh while this was happening uh your father who you were very
[3:51:33.160 --> 3:51:43.480]  close to passed away uh tell us about how the nypd treated that well uh shortly after uh
[3:51:43.480 --> 3:51:52.200]  january uh six uh my father was uh diagnosed with brain cancer that's cleoblastoma it was um
[3:51:52.200 --> 3:51:58.440]  stage four my father was 76 years old uh you know he i don't even know if the man had a parking ticket
[3:51:59.480 --> 3:52:05.880]  he's uh you know he was an immigrant from sicily he came here in the in the 70s worked his whole life
[3:52:05.880 --> 3:52:16.120]  uh he got sick out of nowhere and um i got the call and obviously if uh funny that it's january
[3:52:16.120 --> 3:52:21.720]  25th that i was interrogated by the nypd which uh you would know you remember that day like it was
[3:52:21.720 --> 3:52:28.520]  yesterday january 25th 2019 is when uh you had the gestapo rate so i went through an interrogation
[3:52:28.520 --> 3:52:36.200]  and my father was losing his senses losing speech you know he was digressing uh you know
[3:52:36.200 --> 3:52:41.480]  very rapidly so they decided to have surgery on him and i wasn't able to be there for him
[3:52:41.480 --> 3:52:47.480]  because one i am being harassed and pressured by not only the nypd but i have uh countless
[3:52:48.520 --> 3:52:54.680]  media publications and also the vitriol of hate that's on twitter with all these people
[3:52:54.680 --> 3:52:58.840]  that don't know anything about what's going on in your life they were attacking me
[3:52:58.840 --> 3:53:05.880]  so uh i finally got around to seeing my father who at this point could not even speak anymore
[3:53:07.080 --> 3:53:13.880]  my father did not speak to me till i have i the last time i heard his voice was before january 26th
[3:53:14.600 --> 3:53:22.440]  my father was laying in a debt basically his deathbed in hospitals and i i went to the hospital
[3:53:22.440 --> 3:53:28.440]  from here all the way to pennsylvania noticed a vehicle that was behind me it was following me
[3:53:28.440 --> 3:53:34.760]  obviously you know it takes a cop to know something i made it to the hospital and i was there in the
[3:53:34.760 --> 3:53:42.040]  final hours and i watched my father pass away in front of me with uh a member of the new york
[3:53:42.040 --> 3:53:48.680]  city police department in the parking lot uh they followed me apparently as i learned in the um
[3:53:48.680 --> 3:53:56.520]  um trial uh they were seeing they wanted to see if i would come into contact with you
[3:53:57.320 --> 3:54:02.200]  all the way in florida meaning i was supposed to work that day so apparently i would have
[3:54:02.200 --> 3:54:07.640]  driven all the way to florida and come back to work somehow inside of 24 hours which is i don't
[3:54:07.640 --> 3:54:14.200]  even know what to say about that so this is an equal protection case it's very simple folks the
[3:54:14.200 --> 3:54:19.400]  new york police department cannot treat officer greco differently than they treated new york
