[00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:05.157]  Do you remember that one time that one guy was like, the tap water's turning the frogs gay?
[00:00:05.177 --> 00:00:09.578]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:11.199]  That was funny.
[00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.980]  Yeah, and then it wasn't turning them gay, it was just causing the male frogs to grow female reproductive organs.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.961]  That was pretty classic.
[00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.810]  Wait, what?
[00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:21.751]  Oh, come on.
[00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:23.152]  You've heard this one before.
[00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:26.515]  Herbicide gets in the water via farming runoff.
[00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:31.238]  Likely, according to research, has adverse effects on hormones and vertebrates.
[00:00:31.318 --> 00:00:32.219]  What are you gonna do?
[00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.840]  I don't know about this one.
[00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:41.566]  And then the owners of the herbicide lobbied the EPA so nobody else could do research on the harmful effects of the herbicide besides them.
[00:00:41.626 --> 00:00:44.188]  This isn't as funny as the frogs turning gay.
[00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:53.896]   Yeah, you know, saying the government organizations that are supposed to protect us and the corporations that are supposed to benefit us I actually put profit motive over ecological harm every time.
[00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:55.477]  It's not as catchy.
[00:00:55.877 --> 00:00:58.500]  If only the frogs were just turning gay, am I right?
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.781]  I don't like it here.
[00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:00.681]  Join the club.
[00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:15.733]  A decade ago, when I talked about chemicals in the water turning the frogs gay, the media only took a short clip out of a 30-plus minute report where I laid out university studies and documents from South Africa, the US, Europe, you name it.
[00:01:16.514 --> 00:01:37.868]  That atrazine alone in the water was making the frogs hermaphroditic, both male and female, and that male frogs were more attracted to other male frogs, and so that those populations of frogs and toads were collapsing, dying out, in some cases becoming extinct, and that this same chemical is bombarding us.
[00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:45.294]   Then you learn The Globalists are purposely putting similar chemicals in the plastics and that's why fertility and sperm counts have dropped.
[00:01:45.754 --> 00:01:52.560]  There is not a more important issue to focus on and understand than this because it's all about depopulation.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:05.429]   Now Target has come out and has a whole clothing line, a whole section for people to cover up their breasts with compression girdles so that they won't have breasts so they can be men
[00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.399]   and so that men can cover up that they have genitals and
[00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:17.639]   transition to having them sexually mutilated and removed surgically this is the cult
[00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:23.158]   We're talking about now where the chemicals have confused people created so many hemaphrodites
[00:02:23.158 --> 00:02:29.879]   Done, you know so many terrible things to humanity that now ladies and gentlemen
[00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.919]   They're moving ahead with rolling out the standardization of it and the normalization of it
[00:02:35.248 --> 00:02:37.910]  This is a giant depopulation program.
[00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.894]  Look at this for yourself and realize it's all the big corporations and Hollywood.
[00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:51.806]  Disney, working in concert to sexualize children to confuse the sexes for transgenderism that is part of the whole movement.
[00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.690]   that we see with the transhumanists. They're getting us ready for the clones,
[00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.010]   the animal-human programs, the splicing, all of this information. So I want to encourage
[00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:10.289]   listeners and viewers to understand that this is an absolutely central issue that we are covering
[00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:15.250]   and that we're laying out, and it's another reason InfoWars is so precious. But we can fight back
[00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.649]   against everything they're doing to us and their attacks on our immune systems and more
[00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:24.770]   with the products at InfoWarsTore.com. It's not just the information we cover, but the products
[00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.689]   we have that are amazing as well. We have InfoWars immune support with concentrated cold-pressed
[00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:38.147]   herbs and other compounds that are known to supercharge your body's immune system and it also funds the broadcast.

[00:03:54.907 --> 00:03:58.307]   There's other things you can do like filtering your water so you're not getting the fluoride
[00:03:58.307 --> 00:03:59.427]  and the chemicals in it.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.262]  There's other things you can do like fasting and going in steam rooms.
[00:04:04.622 --> 00:04:07.543]  And look, I'm not somebody that implements all of this myself.
[00:04:07.943 --> 00:04:11.524]  I'm implementing part of it, but I do know the science and I know what I need to do.
[00:04:11.664 --> 00:04:15.486]  And I personally have just been doing this over the last month and I've lost 25 pounds.
[00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:16.126]  So, GetX2.
[00:04:18.447 --> 00:04:26.892]  Get Brainforce Ultra, get Ultra 12, get our immune support and more at mfulworldstore.com and fund the tip of the spear in the fight.
[00:04:27.532 --> 00:04:30.154]  All the big corporations are globalists, they're coming after you.
[00:04:30.394 --> 00:04:33.936]  That's why supporting independent media and media funding itself is more important than ever.
[00:04:34.036 --> 00:04:36.036]  Please support us at Infolwarestore.com.
[00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:38.776]  (dramatic music)
[00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:46.192]  I think you are full of conspiracies and I don't think that you are helping our country.
[00:04:46.232 --> 00:04:48.554]  Did you know the media misrepresents what I actually say?
[00:04:48.794 --> 00:04:50.376]  Like, give me an example of one of my conspiracies.
[00:04:50.396 --> 00:04:51.797]  Uh, that... Hold on, hold on a minute.
[00:04:52.818 --> 00:04:54.320]  That water is making the frogs skate.
[00:04:57.202 --> 00:05:05.226]  It might look like we're out in a bush somewhere, but 15 feet on either side, we're surrounded by agriculture, and the runoff ends up in this river.
[00:05:06.007 --> 00:05:11.030]  All of the algae is the result of all the nutrients, because a lot of fertilizers are used in agriculture.
[00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.932]  And once those fertilizers get into the water, you get these blooms of algae.
[00:05:15.752 --> 00:05:21.497]  Our data so far suggests that the mixture of pesticides causes an increase in stress hormones.
[00:05:22.018 --> 00:05:28.243]  And those stress hormones cause immunosuppression, which leads to the inability to respond to any kind of disease pathogen.
[00:05:29.224 --> 00:05:32.967]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:05:33.508 --> 00:05:38.227]   It seems that even the tough bullfrog isn't doing so well with the toxins in this water.
[00:05:38.227 --> 00:05:45.187]  I got a chair going.
[00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:47.282]  I got a chant going.
[00:05:47.682 --> 00:05:48.583]  What about gay frogs?
[00:05:48.863 --> 00:05:49.543]  It's not funny!
[00:05:49.624 --> 00:05:52.285]  I'm gonna say it real slow for you.
[00:05:52.305 --> 00:05:53.386]  GAY FROGS!
[00:05:53.766 --> 00:05:57.909]  Hayes is testing the effects of chemicals like atrazine, a common herbicide.
[00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.233]  We have a whole family of animals where we've eliminated the female chromosome.
[00:06:03.553 --> 00:06:04.794]  Specimen zero one.
[00:06:06.072 --> 00:06:10.255]  These animals that we know are genetic males have been exposed to atrazine for their entire life.
[00:06:10.956 --> 00:06:14.899]  And many of these genetic males now are turning into females.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.524]  And quite frankly, if you're a genetic male, it'd be nice if you developed as a genetic male.
[00:06:20.544 --> 00:06:25.068]  And now we have a chemical very common in the environment that's effectively sex-reversing animals.
[00:06:25.588 --> 00:06:29.531]  Now obviously it's not fair to judge a guy on one isolated dumbass clip.
[00:06:30.212 --> 00:06:31.193]  So here's a bunch of them.
[00:06:31.913 --> 00:06:33.374]  Alex is anti-gay.
[00:06:33.835 --> 00:06:36.036]  He's saying the chemicals are making people gay.
[00:06:36.517 --> 00:06:38.538]  Folks, it's making the frogs gay.
[00:06:38.858 --> 00:06:42.161]  Two-thirds of the frogs down in Houston are bisexual.
[00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:44.022]  Do you understand that?
[00:06:44.082 --> 00:06:45.764]  Turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:06:45.603 --> 00:06:47.603]  Bang, bang, shit is crap!
[00:06:47.603 --> 00:06:56.603]  The one that's sort of remarkable is this pair.
[00:06:56.603 --> 00:06:58.503]  (upbeat music)
[00:06:58.646 --> 00:06:59.467]  These are both males.
[00:07:00.028 --> 00:07:04.573]  The one on the bottom, acting as the female, we affectionately refer to as Darnell.
[00:07:05.274 --> 00:07:10.180]  He's a genetic male that not only acts like a female, he lays eggs like a female.
[00:07:11.101 --> 00:07:13.524]  He, she has been exposed to Atrazine.
[00:07:14.938 --> 00:07:16.219]  All of her, his, her life.
[00:07:16.239 --> 00:07:17.679]  I don't even really know how to reference it.
[00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:19.540]  This is Darnell's third clutch.
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.742]  So Darnell has sons and daughters that we've grown up.
[00:07:23.462 --> 00:07:24.783]  You can see eggs in the bottom.
[00:07:25.463 --> 00:07:27.164]  This is actually her second clutch for today.
[00:07:27.724 --> 00:07:31.026]  He, she has been copulating for getting close to 24 hours now.
[00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:36.415]  This is probably one of the most remarkable things I've seen in my work.
[00:07:37.475 --> 00:07:47.059]  Jones has argued that the government has the ability to control tornadoes, and that tap water is a gay bomb, and that they are putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.960]  I'm gonna say it real slow for you.
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.101]  FROGS!
[00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:54.149]  I am worried.
[00:07:54.209 --> 00:07:57.811]  This is the most common contaminant in ground and surface water and drinking water.
[00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:05.614]  And the level of atrazine that it took to make this male turn into a female is three times less than what's allowed in our drinking water.
[00:08:06.634 --> 00:08:07.435]  You know what?
[00:08:07.555 --> 00:08:10.736]  I guess it makes sense that Donald Trump wants to impress Alex Jones.
[00:08:11.016 --> 00:08:14.738]  Why would you want to drain the swamp if not to eradicate all those gay frogs?
[00:08:15.718 --> 00:08:16.498]  You stay there.
[00:08:16.739 --> 00:08:18.059]  You two stay where you are.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.241]  It's not just the problem with frogs we should be concerned about.
[00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:25.983]  The water that's causing their problems is the same water that we're drinking and using to water our crops.
[00:08:28.904 --> 00:08:30.505]  Do you understand that?
[00:08:30.545 --> 00:08:32.246]  Turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:08:32.266 --> 00:08:32.626]  Boo!
[00:08:32.666 --> 00:08:33.006]  Boo!
[00:08:33.066 --> 00:08:33.827]  Serious crap!
[00:08:33.907 --> 00:08:34.287]  Gay!
[00:08:34.327 --> 00:08:34.667]  Frogs!
[00:08:34.727 --> 00:08:35.508]  Friggin' frogs!
[00:08:35.608 --> 00:08:35.828]  Boo!
[00:08:35.888 --> 00:08:36.828]  It's not funny!
[00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:38.529]  I'm gonna say it real slow for it.
