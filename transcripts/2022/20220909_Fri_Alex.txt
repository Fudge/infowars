[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.591]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[00:00:01.671 --> 00:00:02.932]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[00:00:02.972 --> 00:00:04.033]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[00:00:04.093 --> 00:00:05.475]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to?
[00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:06.236]  And Joe Rogan?
[00:00:06.476 --> 00:00:06.957]  Elon Musk?
[00:00:07.117 --> 00:00:08.198]  You know where they tune in, right?
[00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:11.842]  They tune in right here!
[00:00:13.103 --> 00:00:13.824]  InfoWars.
[00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:15.086]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:15.726]  Today.
[00:00:15.746 --> 00:00:18.790]  Well, I don't know what will happen now.
[00:00:20.231 --> 00:00:24.653]  We've got some difficult days ahead, but I'm not concerned about that now.
[00:00:26.534 --> 00:00:28.334]  I just want to do God's will.
[00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:32.856]  And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain.
[00:00:32.876 --> 00:00:40.307]   And I've looked over The promised land.
[00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:51.224]  I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land!
[00:00:53.107 --> 00:00:53.828]  We gotta come together.
[00:00:54.648 --> 00:00:58.851]  Whether you believe in that or not, you've got to decide whether you have dominion over yourself.
[00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:12.599]  I believe that the majority of the plain people of the United States will, day in and day out, make fewer mistakes in governing themselves than any smaller class or body of men, no matter what their training, will make in trying to govern.
[00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:22.405]  And you've got to decide whether it's God that's going to have dominion over you, that you get orders from, or whether some other human that's jacked into the evil force is going to have dominion over you.
[00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:33.673]  What we're talking about now is like a second industrial revolution, but the product this time will not be textiles or machines or vehicles or even weapons.
[00:01:34.014 --> 00:01:37.255]  The product this time will be humans themselves.
[00:01:37.275 --> 00:01:39.497]  Do we want to have a human plan or a post-human plan?
[00:01:40.097 --> 00:01:46.680]  Noval Harari and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates say humans are obsolete, we're scum, because they know we are their competition.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.902]  They know that if we go for what we want and what God wants to have, they can't compete with that transmission.
[00:01:53.283 --> 00:01:54.683]  They can't compete with that blueprint.
[00:01:54.923 --> 00:01:56.444]  They can't compete with that architecture.
[00:01:56.844 --> 00:01:59.205]  They can't compete with that master plan.
[00:01:59.705 --> 00:02:00.685]  But I just see it now.
[00:02:01.205 --> 00:02:02.305]  It'll be so clear soon.
[00:02:02.785 --> 00:02:04.586]  Are you pro-human or are you anti-human?
[00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:08.066]  You are the human resistance to this alien takeover.
[00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:15.748]  And again, when I say alien takeover, I don't mean some little tinfoil flying saucer crashing in Roswell from Alpha Centauri.
[00:02:16.288 --> 00:02:22.029]  I'm talking about the transmission in the universe of God's order and God's will.
[00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:26.070]  Or do you choose to serve the agents of death?
[00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:29.808]  And like Martin Luther King said, we're not going to judge them off what color they are.
[00:02:29.828 --> 00:02:34.950]  We're going to judge them off of their character, of their actions and deeds.
[00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:37.592]  So I'm going to say it right now, real clear.
[00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:41.454]  I love everybody, no matter what color your beautiful skin is.
[00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:44.535]  But I care about your heart and your guts and your mind.
[00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:46.837]  And you're under attack by these Satanists.
[00:02:47.037 --> 00:02:48.197]  And they want to kill you!
[00:02:48.217 --> 00:02:49.918]  And they want to kill your children!
[00:02:50.318 --> 00:02:52.560]  And I say we set our differences aside.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:02.765]  And I say we come together and we beat these people and we smash their technocracy and we build the future together and we can do anything with our real diversity.
[00:03:03.405 --> 00:03:05.406]  These enemies tell us all day about diversity.
[00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:09.048]  They mean divided and conquered groups of people separate from each other.
[00:03:09.068 --> 00:03:14.750]  This bill is supported by all of the Democrats, House and Senate.
[00:03:15.531 --> 00:03:17.532]  It's just a filibuster in a way.
[00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:32.182]  So in a way, if you really truly want to honor Dr. King, don't dishonor him by using a congressional custom as an excuse for protecting our democracy.
[00:03:32.242 --> 00:03:41.831]  I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump and you ain't black, I want unity under a code of freedom.
[00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:47.692]  And liberty, and justice, and coming together, and working together, and being strong.
[00:03:48.013 --> 00:03:56.338]  And that's what InfoWars is, and that's why the enemies of humanity hate us so much, because we love God!
[00:03:57.038 --> 00:03:58.579]  And God loves humanity!
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.382]  And I am a human supremacist!
[00:04:02.862 --> 00:04:05.662]  I am a human supremacist!
[00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.462]  I am a human supremacist!
[00:04:08.462 --> 00:04:11.061]  I am a human supremacist!
[00:04:11.061 --> 00:04:14.662]  I am a human supremacist!
[00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:18.330]  That term will be the future war with the robots and the AI.
[00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.073]  What you're hearing now is the entire future and everything they tried to stop us from doing.
[00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.974]  Our supremacy will not end with this planet!
[00:04:26.574 --> 00:04:28.336]  We will heap all the stars!
[00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:29.457]  We will colonize!
[00:04:29.617 --> 00:04:31.539]  We will green dead worlds!
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.281]  We will go interdimensional!
[00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:35.003]  We will unlock the secrets of the universe!
[00:04:35.283 --> 00:04:37.826]  God has laid them out like Christmas presents for his children.
[00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:48.778]  And I am extremely honored to be in the fulcrum and the heart of the fight to bring our race, the human race, in a race for the future!
[00:04:49.398 --> 00:04:50.499]  And we will break the enemy.
[00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:52.361]  We will break the pedophiles.
[00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:53.822]  We will break the Satanists.
[00:04:54.102 --> 00:04:59.988]  Because God already sent his own self down here to show us he could do it.
[00:05:00.588 --> 00:05:04.331]  God would never ask us to go through an obstacle course he wouldn't go through.
[00:05:04.351 --> 00:05:06.513]  And now we're going to go through what Christ did.
[00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:11.293]   did and we're gonna go through it and we're gonna be destroyed but reborn on the other side
[00:05:11.293 --> 00:05:39.132]   it's friday september 9th 2020 info wars tomorrow's news today
[00:05:39.132 --> 00:05:53.359]   it is friday september 9th 2022 60 days out for the midterms And on Thursday, September 8th, for the first time in 70 years, there's a new King of England.
[00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.922]  Our media says he's our best friend.
[00:05:56.782 --> 00:06:00.942]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:00.942 --> 00:06:06.721]   On Thursday, September 8th, for the first time in 70 years,
[00:06:06.721 --> 00:06:10.062]  there's a new king of England.
[00:06:10.062 --> 00:06:13.742]  Our media says he's our best friend, he's our leader.
[00:06:13.742 --> 00:06:20.942]   But our country was forged in war with his ancestor who declared war on us
[00:06:20.942 --> 00:06:24.062]  more than 250 years ago.
[00:06:24.523 --> 00:06:30.347]  The 4th of July, all of it, is about our war with that Transylvanian family.
[00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:47.502]   And when Prince Charles, now King of England, arrived yesterday, Visit the body of his mother with Camilla Parker Bowles.
[00:06:48.443 --> 00:06:53.345]  They began to chant, God save the King.
[00:06:55.246 --> 00:07:12.415]   And here, ladies and gentlemen, is video of your TV viewer of the new King of England, who just a year ago declared war on humanity and called for a global military action to cut Carbon across the planet that will estimatedly kill more than 3 billion people at the cuts that they have projected.
[00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:16.555]   Let's roll that audio with the video of the new King of England arriving.
[00:07:16.555 --> 00:07:18.555]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:07:18.555 --> 00:07:28.555]  [APPLAUSE]
[00:07:28.555 --> 00:07:30.555]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:07:30.555 --> 00:07:32.555]  God save the king!
[00:07:32.555 --> 00:07:34.555]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:36.555]  A truly disgusting display.
[00:07:36.555 --> 00:07:40.555]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:07:40.601 --> 00:07:49.807]  There are the lizards creeping out of their vehicle.
[00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:55.511]  Or Bentley, it looks like a hearse.
[00:08:00.294 --> 00:08:02.456]  God save our king!
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.263]  Our country was born in a war against his predecessor, his ancestor.
[00:08:09.605 --> 00:08:14.605]  The House of Windsor is about as English as Japanese sushi.
[00:08:14.605 --> 00:08:21.605]  [crowd noise]
[00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:23.605]  King Charles!
[00:08:23.116 --> 00:08:23.857]  King Charles III!
[00:08:24.757 --> 00:08:30.923]  Royalty, power and abject, are stationed before him.
[00:08:32.788 --> 00:08:35.989]  God save our King!
[00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:41.012]  Truly disgusting.
[00:08:42.773 --> 00:08:56.939]  So, his father called for reducing the world population by at least 80% with a deadly virus, and of course was a Nazi, but then flipped sides.
[00:08:59.631 --> 00:09:04.801]  And now we see our controlled press fawning in sycophantic passion.
[00:09:06.292 --> 00:09:12.333]  After this, this is a man who wants to cut off the world's energy supplies and kill at least 3 billion people.
[00:09:12.373 --> 00:09:16.534]  That doesn't get over the 80% number, but that's what the mainline corporate estimates are.
[00:09:17.234 --> 00:09:30.577]  If the energy is cut the way they want, half of it by 2030, what it will do, you're already seeing just a slight energy cut and third world collapsing, over 60 million extra starving to death in the last two and a half years, collapsing borders.
[00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:56.369]   Here is the King of England, less than a year ago, Declaring war at one of these WEF events on humanity with this massive military corporate financial mobilization he said that will create more money than there is in the world already for him to have this radical transformation off of carbon to the new dark age.
[00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:57.270]  There is no replacement.
[00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.291]  And they know that.
[00:09:59.071 --> 00:09:59.472]  Here he is.
[00:10:00.859 --> 00:10:11.947]  So, my plea today is for countries to come together to create the environment that enables every sector of industry to take the action required.
[00:10:13.468 --> 00:10:16.991]  We know this will take trillions, not billions of dollars.
[00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:27.038]  We also know that countries, many of whom are burdened by growing levels of debt, simply cannot afford to go green.
[00:10:28.871 --> 00:10:34.617]  Here we need a vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength of the global private sector.
[00:10:35.698 --> 00:10:52.635]  With trillions at his disposal, far beyond global GDP, and with the greatest respect, beyond even the governments of the world's leaders, it offers the only real prospect of achieving fundamental economic transition.
[00:10:55.091 --> 00:10:58.392]  What did CNN say in that secret video that came out earlier this year?
[00:10:58.412 --> 00:11:03.173]  They said, after we're done scaring them with COVID, we're going to move to climate change and new climate lockdowns.
[00:11:04.794 --> 00:11:05.554]  Which equals death.
[00:11:05.754 --> 00:11:06.294]  Starvation.
[00:11:07.314 --> 00:11:07.935]  The burden.
[00:11:07.955 --> 00:11:10.895]  We're going to take that burden away from you, my dearie.
[00:11:11.756 --> 00:11:13.176]  Him and his good buddy Jimmy Savelle.
[00:11:14.796 --> 00:11:15.477]  So here we are.
[00:11:15.537 --> 00:11:16.557]  That's where we are.
[00:11:18.017 --> 00:11:22.739]  And they've tricked a lot of people in the UK who've had their nationalism and their culture attacked.
[00:11:22.779 --> 00:11:23.499]  You shouldn't fly.
[00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:27.868]  King George Flagg, you shouldn't do any of that.
[00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:42.234]  To think the monarchy is the inculcation and the embodiment of who they are, when this is a bloodline, since the House of Stuart and Tudor was taken out, that is not English at all.
[00:11:43.895 --> 00:11:50.658]  In fact, they're not even really Norman, who took over close to a thousand years ago there, the Vikings.
[00:11:52.418 --> 00:11:53.759]  So it's just a total fraud.
[00:11:54.955 --> 00:11:58.556]  And in World War I, it became a big deal that they were all Eastern European and German.
[00:11:58.576 --> 00:12:00.216]  They're really Eastern European.
[00:12:02.457 --> 00:12:04.737]  And Hungarian, Romanian.
[00:12:06.257 --> 00:12:08.018]  That's what their lineage goes back to.
[00:12:08.718 --> 00:12:09.218]  The dragon.
[00:12:10.678 --> 00:12:12.719]  That's why their symbol is not really the lion rampant.
[00:12:14.479 --> 00:12:16.100]  Their symbol is not really the unicorn.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.621]  The original symbol of England, obviously, is the original King George slaying the dragon.
[00:12:24.344 --> 00:12:26.165]  Their banner is the dragon.
[00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:39.015]  And that's why when England goes to war and gets rid of any checks and balances or chivalry, when there is no quarter given, it's called flying the dragon flag.
[00:12:41.277 --> 00:12:46.441]  And the King of England is the sworn enemy of humanity in his own words.
[00:12:49.437 --> 00:12:51.598]  So you think about that, and you understand that.
[00:12:52.058 --> 00:12:57.341]  And when you grovel to these people, you are pissing on America and what this country was founded.
[00:12:57.661 --> 00:13:04.204]  The New World Order wants to get rid of America because we're an example to be the opposition to monarchy and the opposition to globalism.
[00:13:04.224 --> 00:13:11.808]  And it's been this royal family that's run Parliament, and that runs the Governor Generals of Australia and the rest of the Commonwealth, like Canada.
[00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:20.127]  That has opened the borders up and attacked British culture and Scottish culture and Irish culture and run it into the ground.
[00:13:21.087 --> 00:13:30.009]  And they had the feckless communists criticize the monarchy while the monarchy was actually funding communism to take over the world.
[00:13:30.849 --> 00:13:40.071]  And people see that and they say, well, we should back the monarchy because the left doesn't like them.
[00:13:40.731 --> 00:13:42.271]  Bull crap.
[00:13:44.141 --> 00:13:46.924]  This is the dialectic that they've created.
[00:13:46.964 --> 00:13:49.266]  Now, I'm not going to talk much more about these people today.
[00:13:51.268 --> 00:13:59.476]  And out of the unsavory lot, I would say Queen Elizabeth II never really said or did anything overtly bad and seemed like an interesting lady.
[00:14:00.037 --> 00:14:00.798]  But her husband!
[00:14:01.667 --> 00:14:05.949]  He said he wants to kill 80% of us with a deadly virus on record to Reuters and other publications.
[00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:15.772]  And her son runs around saying the same thing and is quarterbacking right in the middle of this thing and field marshalling the attack on the world energy supply and food supply.
[00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:36.075]   It's just outrageous to have this inbred person who at 76 years of age finally got a job Lecturing all of us on how the world should operate and what we should do while they cut off pensioners gas allotments this winter but he lives in giant 400 room palaces.
[00:14:36.155 --> 00:14:44.919]  It's just absurdity and oxymoronic hypocrisy.
[00:14:46.585 --> 00:14:54.473]  Scales above the Davos group flying in on their own private jets and eating caviar while they lecture you, you've got to starve to death and die because of carbon use.
[00:14:54.533 --> 00:14:56.415]  It's just all disgusting.
[00:14:58.317 --> 00:15:04.564]  It's absolutely in contravention to everything freedom and the Renaissance stand for.
[00:15:05.373 --> 00:15:12.556]  Infowars.com, defending humanity, standing against the King of England, who is as close to Satan as you're going to get.
[00:15:12.836 --> 00:15:18.298]  A global military campaign with more funding than all the GDP of the world combined.
[00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:25.681]  It's not just the money, but all products, all mining, farming, everything.
[00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:37.036]   A UN world government corporate takeover with more funds and more production That they control that the entire world already has.
[00:15:38.317 --> 00:15:40.919]  The AI robot transhumanist takeover.
[00:15:42.601 --> 00:15:43.361]  That they've announced.
[00:15:44.582 --> 00:15:48.506]  And now they're sabotaging regular civilization and shutting off all the small businesses.
[00:15:48.526 --> 00:15:52.289]  The German government said there will be no more craft businesses because of energy.
[00:15:52.589 --> 00:15:54.751]  There will only be big corporate stores.
[00:15:56.032 --> 00:16:00.656]  And then for the right to spend money there and buy products there, you'll have to social credit score approval.
[00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.931]  Through the Universal Basic Income Carbon Tax System.
[00:16:04.291 --> 00:16:05.532]  This hell isn't coming.
[00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:07.253]  This hell is here.
[00:16:07.273 --> 00:16:09.794]  And we got some big guests today.
[00:16:10.775 --> 00:16:23.562]  Steve Bannon got indicted two days ago for money laundering and a bunch of other BS by the George Soros created and appointed minion, Letitia James, the New York Attorney General.
[00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:36.704]   And he turned himself in yesterday and they did a perp walk Down the street, past the cameras, all part of their show trial operation.
[00:16:37.424 --> 00:16:38.505]  Steve Bannon joins us.
[00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:41.107]  He's bailed out next hour.
[00:16:42.188 --> 00:16:53.318]  Then, Dr. Andrew Wakefield vindicated one of the first respected research doctors and scientists to document the connection between so-called childhood immunizations and autism.
[00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:55.777]  They put out fake reports trying to discredit him.
[00:16:56.177 --> 00:16:58.719]  Later it came out, a decade later, that he was absolutely right.
[00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:00.440]  They'd falsified reports against him.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:08.565]  He's going to talk about the train wreck of the new world order, these new deadly injections, and where he sees it all going in the third hour today.
[00:17:10.045 --> 00:17:17.270]  But speaking of Steve Bannon, let's go ahead and roll some clips of him turning himself in, then marching him in the building, then marching him back out in front of the cameras.
[00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.231]  This is just unbelievable.
[00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:22.290]  Yeah.
[00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:32.109]  [NOISE]
[00:17:31.172 --> 00:17:35.652]   On the very day the mayor of this city has a delegation down on the border,
[00:17:35.652 --> 00:17:38.931]   they're persecuting people here and they're trying to stop on the border.
[00:17:38.931 --> 00:17:41.172]  We're gonna make it.
[00:17:41.172 --> 00:17:42.851]  60 days from today.
[00:17:42.851 --> 00:17:43.572]  60 days.
[00:17:43.572 --> 00:17:44.770]  60 days.
[00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:45.412]  Take a step back.
[00:17:45.412 --> 00:17:46.211]  Take a step back.
[00:17:46.211 --> 00:17:48.932]  60 days from today.
[00:17:48.932 --> 00:17:51.971]  Stop hurting America.
[00:17:51.971 --> 00:17:53.971]  Stop hurting America.
[00:17:53.971 --> 00:17:55.812]  Stop hurting America.
[00:17:55.812 --> 00:17:58.612]  Stop hurting America, you greasy crifter.
[00:17:58.612 --> 00:18:03.570]  Stop hurting America, you greasy, stupid crifter.
[00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:15.092]   For every conservative, this is what happens the last days of a nine.
[00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:20.196]  They will never shut me up, not to kill me first.
[00:18:20.236 --> 00:18:21.856]  I have not yet begun to fight.
[00:18:24.423 --> 00:18:26.664]  That's John Paul Jones, founder of the U.S.
[00:18:26.724 --> 00:18:35.110]  Navy, who was fighting King George III, the great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather of King Charles III.
[00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:47.257]  When his smaller ship, outnumbered 3 to 1, was sinking, but his troops were boarding, his marines were boarding to take over the larger British ship, they hailed across on a bullhorn and said, surrender now.
[00:18:47.857 --> 00:18:50.119]  And he said, I have only begun to fight.
[00:18:52.202 --> 00:18:53.383]  Bannon got the quote a little off.
[00:18:53.463 --> 00:18:54.924]  I have not yet begun to find it.
[00:18:55.365 --> 00:18:56.265]  Some vary on the quote.
[00:18:56.285 --> 00:18:57.747]  The point is you get the meaning of it.
[00:18:59.348 --> 00:19:01.870]  And this is what they're trying to do.
[00:19:02.651 --> 00:19:03.812]  This is what they're trying to push.
[00:19:04.452 --> 00:19:05.233]  This is their plan.
[00:19:06.154 --> 00:19:17.303]  And the same Letitia James is now going after Trump for fundraising and for his post-election fundraising.
[00:19:18.541 --> 00:19:23.103]  They're just trying to outlaw any of us getting money, any of us organizing, any of us getting prepared.
[00:19:23.443 --> 00:19:40.710]  And I looked at the federal indictment that Trump pardoned Bannon on about a year and a half ago or so, and we covered it on air, and he and his staff and crew and the whole organization got a couple hundred thousand dollars out of tens of millions raised, and they built a bunch of wall and drew attention to it?
[00:19:43.371 --> 00:19:54.951]   I mean, they were building a wall on private property on the border, Bono kept more money than anybody ever has with his African project that they put on at the UN.
[00:19:55.291 --> 00:19:57.172]  He raised billions of dollars with this one project.
[00:19:58.032 --> 00:20:03.973]  And he was keeping about half a percent of the money was going to charity.
[00:20:03.993 --> 00:20:05.293]  He was keeping 99 plus percent.
[00:20:05.793 --> 00:20:06.694]  And so it became a big deal.
[00:20:06.754 --> 00:20:09.474]  He began to give one percent, which made the joke.
[00:20:09.574 --> 00:20:14.095]  It truly is now the one foundation because he gives one percent.
[00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:23.008]  Raises billions of dollars, showing starving African children, and keeps 99% for his own evil New World Order ass.
[00:20:24.329 --> 00:20:26.109]  To hang out with Prince Charles and the rest of them.
[00:20:26.409 --> 00:20:29.290]  Calling for carbon taxes and population reduction.
[00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.010]  And then they scoop up money off the people they're killing.
[00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.611]  Yeah, there's the Financial Times.
[00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:36.971]  Bono apologizes for abuses at one charity.
[00:20:37.431 --> 00:20:38.291]  So, he started giving 1%.
[00:20:40.472 --> 00:20:41.072]  What a nice man.
[00:20:41.092 --> 00:20:42.012]  Oh, but Steve Bannon?
[00:20:43.302 --> 00:20:46.943]  I think the numbers were they spent about 95% on the project.
[00:20:47.503 --> 00:20:55.805]  The best charity in America with the best ratings is about 87% to charity and that's Salvation Army who I've always supported.
[00:20:55.825 --> 00:20:59.765]  I don't know that they're leftist and woke and been taken over and are bad.
[00:20:59.845 --> 00:21:00.746]  It's very, very sad.
[00:21:01.006 --> 00:21:02.306]  Well, they had record low numbers last year.
[00:21:02.326 --> 00:21:04.086]  People learned they were funding wokeism.
[00:21:05.487 --> 00:21:08.307]  But imagine Salvation Army 85%, Bannon's deal 95%, given to the actual charity, Bono 1%.
[00:21:13.128 --> 00:21:14.530]  And Steve Bannon's the devil.
[00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:16.091]  But it gets worse.
[00:21:17.832 --> 00:21:30.683]  Federal judge just today threw out Trump's lawsuit against Hillary for election meddling, when we know they cooked up, lied to Congress about it, and created the Russiagate dossier, the PP dossier.
[00:21:30.743 --> 00:21:31.103]  All of that.
[00:21:31.463 --> 00:21:39.090]  Judge says, hey, that's not election meddling, and that's not defamation to say you're in a room with hookers, and they're peeing on you, and that you're a Russian agent.
[00:21:40.611 --> 00:21:41.572]  At least be put in jail.
[00:21:42.952 --> 00:21:48.935]  In all the impeachment hearings, judges dismissed Trump's lawsuit after Hillary Clinton over the 2016 election.
[00:21:49.675 --> 00:22:07.322]  The federal judge in Florida dismissed Donald Trump's lawsuit against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, saying there was no basis for the former president to claim that Clinton and her allies harmed him with an orchestrated plan to spread false information that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia for the 2016 race.
[00:22:08.903 --> 00:22:10.624]  So they have a get-out-of-jail-free card.
[00:22:11.656 --> 00:22:14.418]  Doesn't matter, it all came out in Congress, that Comey lied, she lied.
[00:22:14.718 --> 00:22:20.583]  Doesn't matter, they have all the witnesses, people got indicted over lying about it, that they have all the emails where they set it up and planned it, and Hillary ran it.
[00:22:22.184 --> 00:22:22.824]  None of that matters.
[00:22:22.844 --> 00:22:26.687]  Just like Biden two weeks ago said, I had nothing to do with the Mar-a-Lago raid, didn't even know about it.
[00:22:26.807 --> 00:22:30.950]  Now it came out in the federal warrant, the judge released it, that he directed it.
[00:22:33.052 --> 00:22:34.873]  Par for the course.
[00:22:35.434 --> 00:22:40.818]  Biden said yesterday, that under his new Green Deal, you'll save $500 a month on your energy bills.
[00:22:41.989 --> 00:22:44.830]  It's 500 a year, but it'll cost you tens of thousands.
[00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.251]  Everything's a lie with these people.
[00:22:48.972 --> 00:22:51.173]  And it just gets more insane and more crazy by the minute.
[00:22:51.813 --> 00:22:53.073]  Steve Bannon is joining us.
[00:22:53.093 --> 00:22:57.715]  We're going to be covering that, that tower, and so much more.
[00:22:58.536 --> 00:23:06.269]   But I want to get In the Ukraine situation with the Ukrainian top general threatening nuclear war on the Russians and how much that's escalated.
[00:23:06.589 --> 00:23:14.072]  We're gonna go to break, get into the latest COVID-19 information and so much more here on this live Friday, September 9th broadcast.
[00:23:14.092 --> 00:23:14.692]  Please don't forget.
[00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:16.010]  We're losing support.
[00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.411]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:23:17.891 --> 00:23:18.971]  We are barely in the black.
[00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:20.532]  We're in a bankruptcy right now.
[00:23:20.592 --> 00:23:20.912]  Chapter 5.
[00:23:21.232 --> 00:23:23.773]  We've got to be profitable for the company to continue on.
[00:23:23.793 --> 00:23:24.933]  And that's happening, but barely.
[00:23:25.253 --> 00:23:28.214]  So please support us and your great products at the same time.
[00:23:28.254 --> 00:23:29.095]  Please take action now.
[00:23:29.455 --> 00:23:30.555]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:23:31.015 --> 00:23:32.716]  Two of our best-selling products are back in stock.
[00:23:32.756 --> 00:23:36.017]  Brain Force Plus is an amazing tropic and Brain Force Ultra.
[00:23:36.037 --> 00:23:38.158]  Two different formulas, two different ways they act.
[00:23:38.198 --> 00:23:38.978]  They're both amazing.
[00:23:39.458 --> 00:23:42.259]  They're both 50% off and 25% off.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.761]  And back in stock is our best-selling greens fiber capsules.

[00:23:50.924 --> 00:23:52.584]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:23:54.145 --> 00:23:55.286]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:23:55.306 --> 00:24:04.530]  All right, Steve Bannon, truly a man marked to be a political prisoner by the George Soros-controlled judicial system, is joining us for the first 30 minutes of the next hour.
[00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:07.792]  Then Dr. Wakefield will be joining us as well on this Friday edition.
[00:24:09.614 --> 00:24:17.417]  But I'm very pleased with all this negative news to at least see the awakening accelerating and the fact this is really backfiring and the public is figuring it out.
[00:24:17.897 --> 00:24:24.520]  There's all these different national polls where uppers of 80% of Americans think the Mar-a-Lago raid was wrong, that Steve Bannon stuff is wrong.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.720]  People are seeing right through this.
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:30.642]  And at the same time, Tucker Carlson was covering it last night.
[00:24:30.762 --> 00:24:33.003]  I hear a lot of other big national talk show hosts covering it.
[00:24:33.443 --> 00:24:35.043]  Members of the UK Parliament are covering it.
[00:24:35.083 --> 00:24:36.424]  Members of Congress are covering it.
[00:24:37.819 --> 00:24:38.900]  Rand Paul's covering it.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.281]  Johnson's covering it.
[00:24:41.361 --> 00:24:45.003]  And it's getting a lot of attention in the European Union Parliament as well.
[00:24:45.224 --> 00:24:47.505]  I mean, it's a big news item.
[00:24:47.525 --> 00:24:52.288]  Even in the British Medical Journal, saying 9 out of 10 dying of COVID have been triple jabbed.
[00:24:54.209 --> 00:24:56.350]  The vaccine isn't a vaccine that's killing people.
[00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:57.791]  I mean, this is admitted now.
[00:24:57.871 --> 00:24:58.912]  Talk about vindication.
[00:24:59.292 --> 00:25:02.054]  The reason that's as important is almost no one's taking it now.
[00:25:02.474 --> 00:25:05.196]  Almost no one's taking the so-called boosters they're pushing.
[00:25:05.596 --> 00:25:07.357]  But they still try to make the military take it.
[00:25:08.246 --> 00:25:13.233]  They still try to make people that are medical workers take it, and it's all of criminal fraud.
[00:25:14.936 --> 00:25:19.923]  But they built their beachhead, and they want to come back with this again and try to make all of us do it, so we've got to keep hammering it and pushing it.
[00:25:20.423 --> 00:25:21.926]  But I've got to tell you, this is a seven-minute club.
[00:25:21.946 --> 00:25:22.727]  I'm not going to play it all.
[00:25:24.028 --> 00:25:44.242]  But this is a Romanian member of European Union Parliament, Cristian Tauras, blasts Moderna and AstraZeneca and European Parliament COVID Commission, bombshell revelations made by Moderna and AstraZeneca, now they've been sued, they haven't released the documents, and the European Union Parliament COVID Commission for questions asked by this member of Parliament.
[00:25:44.622 --> 00:25:48.945]  And again, lawsuits in the US, lawsuits in Europe, they've been forced to turn over, but most of it's blacked out.
[00:25:49.305 --> 00:25:51.066]  The secret government agreements.
[00:25:51.947 --> 00:25:59.183]   But Bolsonaro, Never agreed to it, and he then released, actually, the demands in Brazil.
[00:26:00.384 --> 00:26:01.866]  And we now learn it's identical.
[00:26:01.886 --> 00:26:02.287]  The U.S.
[00:26:02.307 --> 00:26:03.328]  signed on to it as well.
[00:26:03.428 --> 00:26:03.969]  Brazil didn't.
[00:26:05.638 --> 00:26:13.982]  They indemnify and turn over the national parks and military bases to Pfizer and Moderna if there's ever anybody damaged from the shot.
[00:26:14.223 --> 00:26:21.987]  So they roll the shot out, kill and make a bunch of people sick, then there's lawsuits, and then the government's on the tab, and the corporations come in and take over.
[00:26:22.867 --> 00:26:26.069]  IMF, World Bank, classic economic hitman tactics.
[00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:28.190]  So that's what's been done here.
[00:26:29.491 --> 00:26:30.311]  It's so cold-blooded.
[00:26:30.631 --> 00:26:31.692]  You go, but they'll go to jail.
[00:26:31.812 --> 00:26:33.813]  No, they control the Justice Department.
[00:26:36.058 --> 00:26:41.241]  They don't have full control of Hungary, and places like Romania, and places like Brazil.
[00:26:41.742 --> 00:26:45.544]  And more and more pro-human parties are getting elected, so we're getting close.
[00:26:45.564 --> 00:26:53.109]  And we're going to have Trojan horses like Boris Johnson, who will act like he's a patriot, but stab us in the back.
[00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:58.693]  But in the process overall, we're winning, as long as we know they're the ones destabilizing civilization.
[00:26:59.173 --> 00:27:03.176]  As long as we understand they're the ones carrying this out, and people get the facts, it's game over.
[00:27:03.908 --> 00:27:11.118]  They want an angrier, destabilized world of crime and all the rest of it, but they don't want you to know they're the authors of it.
[00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:14.102]  They think you're stupid, but you're not stupid.
[00:27:14.702 --> 00:27:16.665]  And this has really backfired on them.
[00:27:16.925 --> 00:27:18.568]  So they're in a lot of trouble.
[00:27:19.332 --> 00:27:36.980]  And now it's coming out in the UK, in Canada, in the US, in Germany, in Romania, Brazil was the first, Bolsonaro, that's why, I mean Trump's like right here on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give him about a 7, he means well, but Bolsonaro's a 10 and a half man, like spinal tap, he's an 11.
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:48.585]  That's why they stabbed him in the stomach with like a 8 inch butcher knife, he was back on the campaign trail in a week, punctured his liver and spleen, and just attacking and fighting and that's what we need.
[00:27:49.617 --> 00:27:52.101]  I'm jealous that the Brazilians have Bolsonaro.
[00:27:52.701 --> 00:27:54.784]  He had a rally with 5 million people at it this weekend.
[00:27:55.925 --> 00:27:56.746]  That's leadership.
[00:27:57.087 --> 00:27:57.828]  That's what we need.
[00:27:58.128 --> 00:28:03.395]  That's the type of thing that's going to save us, is a populist that's smart and supports a real man like Bolsonaro.
[00:28:03.415 --> 00:28:04.577]  I mean, look at that.
[00:28:04.897 --> 00:28:06.259]  At least 5 million people.
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:09.801]  Unbelievable.
[00:28:10.001 --> 00:28:23.048]  All right, we're going to play part of this interchange in the Parliament of the European Union and then we'll come back with the mass racial attacks taking place everywhere and how Joe Biden and the entire corporate media is trying to silence it.
[00:28:23.268 --> 00:28:23.668]  Stay with us.
[00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:27.430]  Thank you so much.
[00:28:28.491 --> 00:28:32.313]  The first set of questions is for both AstraZeneca and Moderna.
[00:28:32.593 --> 00:28:37.051]   So the first question is, I would like to know the date If it's possible.
[00:28:37.772 --> 00:28:46.237]  When you decoded the full DNA sequence of this virus, or you solely relied on the sequence provided to you by the Chinese government.
[00:28:46.717 --> 00:28:47.437]  Second question.
[00:28:48.258 --> 00:28:51.920]  Have you tested if the vaccines are stopping the spread of the virus or not?
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.603]  Because the data clearly shows that your products are not stopping the spread of this virus.
[00:28:56.823 --> 00:28:57.403]  Third question.
[00:28:58.344 --> 00:28:59.565]  Have you had people who died?
[00:29:00.492 --> 00:29:04.615]  During human trials, and if so, what were the illnesses that they died from?
[00:29:05.215 --> 00:29:09.218]  Now, I have certain questions for Moderna for Mr. Bouncell.
[00:29:10.478 --> 00:29:17.423]  You stated here that you relied on the sequence provided to you by the Chinese government when you developed your vaccine.
[00:29:18.183 --> 00:29:24.487]  I have here an answer from Emma, which is showing for every vaccine the kind of tests that were done.
[00:29:24.747 --> 00:29:32.765]   So in the case of Moderna, for example, You provided data showing that you tested these vaccines since 2017, 2018, 2019.
[00:29:34.046 --> 00:29:42.253]  So how were you able to test these vaccines back then when we found out about this virus in December of 2019?
[00:29:43.334 --> 00:29:44.895]  Second question, the contracts.
[00:29:45.896 --> 00:29:52.842]  You mentioned here that there are some secrets or some confidential information in these contracts that should protect your interests.
[00:29:53.604 --> 00:29:57.988]  Now the question that I address to you, what about the interest of us and the interest of the European citizens?
[00:29:58.808 --> 00:30:05.253]  Because this is how some of the pages from the contract between Moderna and the European Commission is showing.
[00:30:05.334 --> 00:30:08.116]  So I'm asking you, do you think this is fair to all of us?
[00:30:09.277 --> 00:30:15.282]  To talk about these vaccines, to talk about boosters, to talk about medical products, when we don't know the clauses?
[00:30:16.187 --> 00:30:21.866]   of these contracts. So the direct question to you, Mr. Bonsal is when are you going to
[00:30:21.866 --> 00:30:27.887]   fully publish the contracts that you had both with the European Commission and with the
[00:30:27.887 --> 00:30:33.627]   member states of the European Union? Another question, the issue of liabilities. You were
[00:30:33.627 --> 00:30:38.546]   asked by our colleague here about the liabilities and you avoided to answer this question.
[00:30:39.061 --> 00:30:51.591]  So my question to you is, why are you pushing the liabilities on the states, and on the people who receive these vaccines and might have, and I say might have, adverse effects, while you get all the profits?
[00:30:52.091 --> 00:30:54.793]  Nevertheless, the be violent boosters.
[00:30:54.893 --> 00:30:56.014]  This is the last question.
[00:30:56.894 --> 00:31:06.442]  You just stated here, that these boosters were requested by the US government, who also approved the boosters without trials on humans.
[00:31:07.142 --> 00:31:09.185]  So I'm asking you, do you think this is fair?
[00:31:10.086 --> 00:31:18.496]  Do you think we can go and ask the European citizens to be vaccinated with some medical products that were not properly tested or not at all tested in humans?
[00:31:18.816 --> 00:31:19.076]  Thank you.
[00:31:19.972 --> 00:31:24.013]  Terrace, next time I'll deduct 40 seconds from your speaking time.
[00:31:24.113 --> 00:31:27.254]  And then they go to the CEO that just lies his butt off.
[00:31:27.934 --> 00:31:30.895]  So there's so many bombshells in that four minutes, I don't know where to begin.
[00:31:31.435 --> 00:31:38.036]  But you saw the big one that we pointed out first two and a half years ago with Dr. Francis Boyle, former head U.S.
[00:31:38.076 --> 00:31:40.177]  advisor on bio and chem weapons who wrote the U.S.
[00:31:40.197 --> 00:31:42.397]  law and contributed heavily to the U.N.
[00:31:42.417 --> 00:31:44.378]   law and was the head U.N.' 's war crime prosecutor.
[00:31:44.638 --> 00:31:45.298]  Kind of a heavy hitter.
[00:31:47.082 --> 00:31:53.965]  He said, look at these documents, they go back to 2017 with the same gene sequence, and they called it COVID-19.
[00:31:54.285 --> 00:32:18.430]   They had this damn thing since 2015, Chapel Hill, it was in the news then under another name, they shipped it over there, they produced it, they made it, and then in November of 2019, two months before this stuff starts breaking in the news, two and a half months, they then announce to the big pharma makers secretly, the emails have come out, to prepare this gene sequence and start making this vaccine.
[00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:23.216]  Two mRNA and two virus vector, but they cause the same thing to happen in the body.
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.442]  The production of the spike protein.
[00:32:27.203 --> 00:32:29.926]  So it wasn't the Chinese government that gave him the sequence.
[00:32:30.306 --> 00:32:37.134]  Obama and the New World Order made it in North Carolina, on record, shipped it over there when there was a big congressional hearing and they said it was illegal.
[00:32:37.354 --> 00:32:43.762]  Gained a function, made it, prepared, waited until there was a Republican they didn't like, Donald Trump, and released it and killed a bunch of people.
[00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:51.818]  And now you wonder why they're cutting your energy off, and why they're dissolving the borders, and why they're getting rid of the police, and why crimes doubled and tripled.
[00:32:52.118 --> 00:32:53.340]  Because they're killing us!
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.301]  They're attacking us!
[00:32:54.882 --> 00:32:57.907]  We have real live super villains running things.
[00:32:57.927 --> 00:33:00.070]  This isn't a Marvel comic movie, folks.
[00:33:00.491 --> 00:33:01.933]  This is really happening.
[00:33:03.777 --> 00:33:06.079]  And I'll tell you, I'm up here point-blank range taking them on.
[00:33:06.579 --> 00:33:09.961]  The King of England and his depopulation program, the New World Order, all of them.
[00:33:10.061 --> 00:33:11.322]  I'm not going down without a fight.
[00:33:11.882 --> 00:33:14.344]  I'm not going down without resisting these people in the information war.
[00:33:14.364 --> 00:33:17.626]  I don't know about you, but I don't take it lightly what they're doing to our people.
[00:33:18.027 --> 00:33:18.507]  Humanity.
[00:33:19.087 --> 00:33:21.769]  We'll be back with how they're triggering a race war on the other side.
[00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:23.110]  Infowars.com.
[00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.432]  Almost everybody else gave up.
[00:33:26.172 --> 00:33:27.593]  Almost everybody else sold out.
[00:33:28.754 --> 00:33:30.195]  Almost everybody else never woke up.
[00:33:30.815 --> 00:33:33.477]  But you woke up, and you cared, and you're engaged.
[00:33:34.562 --> 00:33:36.223]  I can't tell you everything I know, folks.
[00:33:36.864 --> 00:33:38.906]  A lot of it is stuff I can't tell you.
[00:33:39.326 --> 00:33:40.247]  I'm sworn to secrecy.
[00:33:41.007 --> 00:33:43.409]  But you better believe we are the American Resistance.
[00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:49.094]  You better believe InfoWars is recognized as the front line in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:33:49.855 --> 00:34:04.437]   We're outnumbered, we're outgunned, but we have the truth and we have the tide of history on our side and we can and we must and we will prevail and you have my commitment 100% To never back down or give up.
[00:34:05.458 --> 00:34:07.859]  You know, I've talked about this and it should be bigger news.
[00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.039]  Because they don't even care.
[00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:18.122]  In negotiations with the Democratic Party lawyers that sued and mangrupted Remington that are running all these shows and you see the big show trials and the rest of it.
[00:34:19.162 --> 00:34:21.583]  They said, just come out against the Second Amendment and it's all dropped.
[00:34:23.764 --> 00:34:24.424]  And I said, no.
[00:34:26.485 --> 00:34:28.065]  Not once, not twice, but three times.
[00:34:28.185 --> 00:34:29.846]  Just come out against the Second Amendment.
[00:34:31.584 --> 00:34:33.826]  So then we don't, so the judges find us in default.
[00:34:34.266 --> 00:34:35.707]  They've got all our records, all our stuff.
[00:34:36.467 --> 00:34:40.010]  Pretend like we never gave it to them, default us, tell a jury we're guilty, and rig all this stuff.
[00:34:41.191 --> 00:34:42.352]  And put out total disinfo.
[00:34:45.113 --> 00:34:46.234]  Look at Steve Bannon, indicted.
[00:34:47.355 --> 00:34:48.196]  Look at Trump, raided.
[00:34:50.337 --> 00:34:53.619]  This is the real deal, folks, because they're coming for you.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.721]  So I'll tell you this right now.
[00:34:58.777 --> 00:35:05.399]  In the last 50 years, they've gotten almost nothing but New World Order operatives into the top brass of the four branches and now the five branches of the military.
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:08.440]  That was Trump's blind spot.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.040]  He didn't know that.
[00:35:09.081 --> 00:35:10.401]  General Flynn tried to explain it to him.
[00:35:12.322 --> 00:35:19.524]  And there are still a few good people like General Flynn, but in the non-commissioned area, they're almost all good people.
[00:35:20.804 --> 00:35:22.085]  And they know exactly what's going on.
[00:35:22.745 --> 00:35:24.906]  Everybody keeps waiting for the military to save you.
[00:35:25.546 --> 00:35:28.027]  The globalists are preparing the military to come against us.
[00:35:28.874 --> 00:35:36.120]  And that's why the best people in the military have gotten out, because they refused to run operations they ran against other foreign countries, against the American people.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.182]  But that's what's going on against Infowars.
[00:35:39.243 --> 00:35:45.087]  And yes, there are people embedded in corporations, and other areas that are on our side, in what you'd call the Deep State.
[00:35:45.368 --> 00:35:46.228]  But it's a minority.
[00:35:49.891 --> 00:35:54.095]  And, obviously the enemy hates our guts, because they know we're for real.
[00:35:55.413 --> 00:35:59.835]  And the enemy knows if what they've done comes out, it's game over for their whole system.
[00:35:59.895 --> 00:36:01.196]  That's why they're so dangerous.
[00:36:03.838 --> 00:36:13.083]  But the fools that have joined the New World Order and think that they're going to be empowered by it are the biggest useful idiots the planet has ever seen.
[00:36:14.343 --> 00:36:17.405]  So this is a battle of we the people with word of mouth.
[00:36:18.251 --> 00:36:28.717]  And human intelligence on the ground spread the articles, the videos, the reports, the key information we cover here that is seen as ground zero and the best hope of the resistance by good people in major corporations and in government.
[00:36:30.458 --> 00:36:33.920]  Because they see you as the best hope and this focal point we've created together.
[00:36:35.881 --> 00:36:41.582]   So I don't like coming to you when we're in this Battle with the globalists and constantly asking for support.
[00:36:41.983 --> 00:36:48.607]  But there isn't a place doing more or better leading the charge of creating talking points based on the truth to counter the enemy.
[00:36:48.747 --> 00:36:55.331]  We are the intellectual leaders of the fight and influencing all the major resistance points.
[00:36:56.052 --> 00:36:58.553]  And I do just as important work when I'm not on air.
[00:36:59.634 --> 00:37:04.137]  Talking to world leaders, talking to top podcasters, talking to top talk show hosts.
[00:37:07.065 --> 00:37:08.405]  And I send them the information.
[00:37:08.545 --> 00:37:09.546]  I make sure they get it.
[00:37:09.666 --> 00:37:10.606]  I challenge them.
[00:37:11.386 --> 00:37:18.728]  I work around the clock for you and your family, because I'm working for myself and my family, and we're going to hang together or hang separate, as Benjamin Franklin said.
[00:37:19.108 --> 00:37:22.749]  But there isn't a better horse in the race to bet on.
[00:37:23.949 --> 00:37:29.871]  So for all of you that have been buying products, and all of you that have been spreading the word, I salute you and thank you, and you're amazing.
[00:37:29.931 --> 00:37:37.517]   But for those of you that listen, but don't spread the word, and those of you that listen and don't buy the products, This is your defense.
[00:37:37.657 --> 00:37:40.158]  This is the front line of people fighting for you.
[00:37:40.939 --> 00:37:42.340]  And I need you to win this fight.
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.600]  You need me to win this fight.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.641]  We need each other.
[00:37:44.921 --> 00:37:54.787]  And I'm asking you now to stop procrastinating and to commit to go to infowarestore.com and buy some of the great products that are there.
[00:37:54.947 --> 00:37:57.629]  And we usually ship within two days of getting an order.
[00:37:58.709 --> 00:38:00.711]  We had pre-sale the books for four weeks.
[00:38:01.171 --> 00:38:02.492]  The book officially came out a week ago.
[00:38:05.598 --> 00:38:08.540]  I've signed 12,000 books.
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.721]  We sold 15,000 signed books, 5,000 non-signed.
[00:38:12.482 --> 00:38:13.742]  We stopped the signed books now.
[00:38:13.762 --> 00:38:15.063]  10,000 more books came in.
[00:38:15.083 --> 00:38:19.125]  If you want to get a book, The Great Recent War for the World, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:38:19.965 --> 00:38:20.946]  And it supports the broadcast.
[00:38:20.986 --> 00:38:21.766]  It's the Death Star Plans.
[00:38:21.826 --> 00:38:22.327]  It's important.
[00:38:23.367 --> 00:38:29.590]  But everybody's books will be shipped out by next Wednesday.
[00:38:30.451 --> 00:38:38.608]   I'm going to come up here this weekend and sign the last 3,000 and We needed to make the funds, so I did $20,000.
[00:38:38.708 --> 00:38:40.449]  I didn't think we could sell $20,000 signed.
[00:38:40.689 --> 00:38:41.029]  Thank you.
[00:38:41.169 --> 00:38:41.849]  It's a lot of support.
[00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:44.891]  And we would be again in the red if it wasn't for you.
[00:38:45.631 --> 00:38:46.932]  But I know some people are pissed off.
[00:38:46.952 --> 00:38:49.853]  A lot of folks are already getting their books because we went back to the first orders five weeks ago.
[00:38:50.393 --> 00:38:55.055]  We're up to about... people that ordered the books about two weeks ago.
[00:38:55.276 --> 00:39:00.618]  And we've never been two weeks behind on orders, but it kind of bottlenecked our whole shipping operation, so I apologize to folks.
[00:39:00.658 --> 00:39:06.341]  But we're working 24 hours a day with overtime right through next Wednesday.
[00:39:07.152 --> 00:39:11.652]  to have all of the orders up until about yesterday out.
[00:39:11.652 --> 00:39:14.411]   And then we'll just be like four or five days behind next Wednesday.
[00:39:14.411 --> 00:39:18.010]   And so by the end of next week, we should be caught up like we normally are,
[00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:21.510]   where if you order on a Wednesday, usually your order shipped on Thursday.
[00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:23.331]  You order on a Friday, it's shipped on Monday.
[00:39:23.331 --> 00:39:24.291]  People love that.
[00:39:24.291 --> 00:39:26.490]  But we're a mom and pop operation.
[00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:29.412]  But we are gonna get you all the products.
[00:39:29.412 --> 00:39:32.891]   And the great news is so many of the products have come back in stock that have been sold out
[00:39:32.891 --> 00:39:39.391]   for up to a year, like our highest quality green fiber, that's all the wheatgrass and other known things
[00:39:39.391 --> 00:39:44.751]   like cilantro and so much more that's so good for your body, your guts, your immune system, everything.
[00:39:44.751 --> 00:39:47.010]  It's back in stock, 50% off.
[00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:53.050]   Rainforest Plus, it's a good, clean, documented, top natural compounds that give you good, clean,
[00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:54.411]  focused energy without the crash.
[00:39:54.411 --> 00:39:57.510]  Last five, six hours, it's back in stock, 50% off.
[00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:07.868]   *cough* Brainforce Ultra is very proprietary, very special, hits in 10 to 15 minutes, gives you incredible next level focus, and wears off in 2 to 3 hours.
[00:40:07.908 --> 00:40:14.590]  So I like to take it when I've got to wake back up to do a bunch of work at night, so I can get 2, 3, 4 hours done and still sleep and not mess up my sleep.
[00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:19.551]  Because let me tell you, TurboForce is sold out right now, 10 hours of clean energy, but it is like rocket fuel.
[00:40:19.911 --> 00:40:22.832]  You don't want to take that 6, 7, 8 hours before you've got to go to sleep.
[00:40:23.962 --> 00:40:28.027]  You don't want to take a turbo force, you know, six, seven, eight hours before you try to go to sleep.
[00:40:28.387 --> 00:40:30.911]  You don't want to take a brain force plus four or five hours before you go to sleep.
[00:40:31.471 --> 00:40:33.874]  This, the whole crew's taking it.
[00:40:33.894 --> 00:40:35.696]  We got the same effects, what the designer said it would do.
[00:40:36.037 --> 00:40:39.161]  Quick acting, really strong, but no comedown.
[00:40:39.381 --> 00:40:40.402]  It's just very special.
[00:40:40.722 --> 00:40:43.446]  Three hours of energy, brain force ultra.

[00:40:52.482 --> 00:40:53.623]  Still big, but lost 40 pounds.
[00:40:53.643 --> 00:40:54.143]  Everybody's seen it.
[00:40:55.103 --> 00:40:55.864]  It sold out.
[00:40:55.944 --> 00:40:56.784]  We've got a very small amount.
[00:40:56.944 --> 00:40:58.005]  A bigger shipment just came in.

[00:41:27.241 --> 00:41:30.482]  Okay, done for my big plug, now let me just say this.
[00:41:32.765 --> 00:41:37.908]  An hour-long Andrew Tate interview yesterday that I'm really proud of, and I think it's his best interview I've seen.
[00:41:38.128 --> 00:41:43.452]  And it's amazing, and it's why they won a Banning, and it really is the antidote to their tyranny and their emasculation program.
[00:41:44.352 --> 00:41:45.293]  That's going to air Monday.
[00:41:46.614 --> 00:41:48.935]  I'm going to come in Monday before the show goes live.
[00:41:49.836 --> 00:41:51.677]  I'm going to tape an hour, whoever the breaking news is.
[00:41:52.598 --> 00:41:54.559]  Hour two will be the Andrew Tate interview.
[00:41:55.359 --> 00:42:00.483]  Hour three will be Owen Schroer, because I'm going to get in the car after I tape the show at 10.
[00:42:02.068 --> 00:42:06.533]  Take the first hour, and then I'm going to drive to Dallas to go on Steven Crowder's show.
[00:42:07.173 --> 00:42:08.214]  Then I'll be back that evening.
[00:42:08.935 --> 00:42:10.096]  But Monday will be a big show.
[00:42:10.156 --> 00:42:21.508]  But we are at the bottom of the next hour, after Andrew Tate leaves us, I mean after Steve Bannon leaves us, going to play some excerpts of the Andrew Tate interview at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:42:21.668 --> 00:42:25.312]  And this guy is getting billions of views a month.
[00:42:26.172 --> 00:42:31.814]  On Twitter and TikTok and Instagram and absolutely waking up young people by storm.
[00:42:32.394 --> 00:42:33.594]  It is amazing.
[00:42:34.035 --> 00:42:36.795]  He's the new Alex Jones when it comes to young people.
[00:42:36.875 --> 00:42:39.936]  And I love getting, you know, replacement troops.
[00:42:40.096 --> 00:42:43.517]  I mean, I don't want to be the tip of the spear, quite frankly.
[00:42:43.537 --> 00:42:45.038]  I want to just win the war against these people.
[00:42:45.378 --> 00:42:46.018]  I'm exhausted.
[00:42:46.738 --> 00:42:50.840]  But everybody I talk to that has high schoolers says all they talk about is Andrew Tate.
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:43:01.588]   I remember one time I went to a School event with some friends at a big public school in Austin, a middle school, and all they were talking about was Alex Jones.
[00:43:01.608 --> 00:43:06.169]  Even though they didn't know it was me, I was wearing a ball cap, the kids were running around the halls playing Alex Jones clips while I was there.
[00:43:06.449 --> 00:43:07.009]  It's that insane.
[00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:08.530]  So you think we're waking adults up?
[00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:10.650]  We've had a very special effect on the young people.
[00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:12.310]  And that's what the enemy really hates.
[00:43:12.831 --> 00:43:13.871]  That's why they hate Andrew Tate.
[00:43:13.931 --> 00:43:16.831]  So that's coming up Monday, but big excerpt sub.
[00:43:16.851 --> 00:43:20.132]  We'll probably hear 10 minutes of it or so, some of the highlights coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:43:20.172 --> 00:43:21.952]  But Steve Manin is straight ahead.
[00:43:21.992 --> 00:43:22.793]  Talk about courage.
[00:43:23.113 --> 00:43:24.153]  Talk about a man under fire.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.402]  Talk about John Paul Jones 2.0, he's a Navy man himself.
[00:43:28.903 --> 00:43:32.365]  It's all coming up with Steve Bannon straight ahead next hour.
[00:43:32.965 --> 00:43:40.470]  Well, they say you don't know a man until they're under fire, and Steve Bannon's been under more fire than even President Trump or myself.
[00:43:41.371 --> 00:43:51.197]  And now Letitia James, the George Soros-funded, created tyrant who swore to get Trump and Bannon, has made good on her promise with his newest trumped-up charges.
[00:43:51.617 --> 00:43:52.098]  Here he is.
[00:43:52.890 --> 00:44:00.818]  Defiantly being perp walked part of their show trial event in front of the media quoting the founder of the US Navy, John Paul Jones, I have only begun to fight.
[00:44:03.661 --> 00:44:10.267]  This is what happens the last days of a dying regime.
[00:44:11.268 --> 00:44:14.912]  They will never shut me up, they'll have to kill me first.
[00:44:14.992 --> 00:44:16.574]  I have not yet begun to fight.
[00:44:20.242 --> 00:44:21.765]  Steve Bannon's here with us for 30 minutes.
[00:44:21.785 --> 00:44:22.426]  He's a busy man.
[00:44:22.466 --> 00:44:25.972]  Steve, I'm going to try to just shut up and give you the floor to give us a briefing on what's really going on here.
[00:44:27.648 --> 00:44:36.356]  Well, this is just to continue this on, you know, yesterday they had a 35-person FBI essentially raid on 35 people regarding J6.
[00:44:37.096 --> 00:44:42.221]  Everything that they're doing right now, Alex, since they've lost in Mar-a-Lago, right?
[00:44:42.261 --> 00:44:43.682]  The judge shut them down in Mar-a-Lago.
[00:44:43.942 --> 00:44:44.923]  That thing shut down.
[00:44:45.183 --> 00:44:48.046]  The J6 committee on Capitol Hill has been a total nothing burger.
[00:44:49.007 --> 00:44:51.489]  They understand they're getting the tables run on them.
[00:44:52.109 --> 00:45:02.279]  Because of your audience and because of War Room Posse and all of it that the MAGA movement, conservative Republicans, are showing out in record numbers to blow them out of the House of Representatives, take over the Senate.
[00:45:02.519 --> 00:45:03.760]  So this is a dying regime.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:09.185]  I mean, you did the best analysis, I think anybody, on the demonic speech of Joe Biden in Philadelphia.
[00:45:09.205 --> 00:45:13.048]  Remember, he had a couple of days in Bethesda and Scranton to lead up to that.
[00:45:13.469 --> 00:45:16.572]  Then he totally demonized our movement and declared war on us.
[00:45:17.052 --> 00:45:18.013]  And this is part of that war.
[00:45:18.053 --> 00:45:22.397]  These things have all been in the works, and so they declared war, then they immediately go.
[00:45:22.737 --> 00:45:26.621]  They obviously can't get to President Trump, so they're going to get to Alex Jones.
[00:45:26.641 --> 00:45:27.682]  They're going to get to Steve Bannon.
[00:45:27.702 --> 00:45:29.904]  They're going to get to everybody that's got a platform.
[00:45:30.164 --> 00:45:33.206]  They're trying to shut our platforms down, and they're trying to stop our voices.
[00:45:33.246 --> 00:45:33.607]  And why?
[00:45:33.627 --> 00:45:38.051]  They understand it's not about Alex Jones or Donald Trump or Steve Bannon or Tucker Carlson.
[00:45:38.531 --> 00:45:42.655]  It's about the people that come to their sites and then become activists.
[00:45:43.055 --> 00:45:43.255]  Right?
[00:45:43.576 --> 00:45:45.278]  That's what they want to shut down, Alex.
[00:45:45.698 --> 00:45:47.901]  They're maniacally focused on doing it.
[00:45:48.161 --> 00:45:48.682]  They're scared.
[00:45:49.142 --> 00:45:52.747]  This is the primal scream of a dying regime.
[00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:54.309]  And we just have to power through it.
[00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:57.632]  I tell people, don't... Yesterday, you know, don't worry about me.
[00:45:58.173 --> 00:45:58.333]  Right?
[00:45:58.373 --> 00:46:00.336]  Just... And people sending their prayers.
[00:46:00.456 --> 00:46:01.197]  I love or appreciate.
[00:46:01.237 --> 00:46:02.018]  Pray for our enemies.
[00:46:02.614 --> 00:46:05.015]  We're on the offense right now, and we're not going to back off.
[00:46:05.036 --> 00:46:10.039]  And that's why I quoted one of my two naval heroes, Errol Nelson being the other.
[00:46:10.779 --> 00:46:13.681]  But John Paul Jones, I have not yet begun to fight.
[00:46:13.721 --> 00:46:19.184]  Remember when he said that, it wasn't looking too good.
[00:46:19.524 --> 00:46:22.066]  Richard was basically a flames and about to sink.
[00:46:22.846 --> 00:46:25.928]  And he won at the end of the day and took the British warship.
[00:46:25.948 --> 00:46:27.489]  So no, Alex, you know military history.
[00:46:28.049 --> 00:46:28.570]  You're a warrior.
[00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:29.710]  You're I Corps commander.
[00:46:30.071 --> 00:46:31.171]  So we're not giving up.
[00:46:31.231 --> 00:46:32.252]  We're not backing down an inch.
[00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:38.812]  Well, I just want you to be able to get out all the key information here in this 30 minutes we have, because you're absolutely right.
[00:46:38.832 --> 00:46:40.433]  People ask, how am I taking all these attacks?
[00:46:40.933 --> 00:46:42.354]  And I said, listen, we're all under attack.
[00:46:42.374 --> 00:46:50.778]  And once you just get that this is an un-American, outside, globalist war, then you just gut up like our ancestors did and decide to do the right thing no matter what happens.
[00:46:52.608 --> 00:46:56.512]  No, listen, that's why I'm so proud to have had you on the show a couple of times about the Great Reset.
[00:46:56.812 --> 00:47:01.677]  You walk everybody through the globalist regime we're up against.
[00:47:02.078 --> 00:47:04.300]  And these guys, it's not even about one election.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.261]  We win this November.
[00:47:05.281 --> 00:47:08.785]  They're not going to sit there and pat you on the head and go, hey, what a lovely idea.
[00:47:08.805 --> 00:47:10.086]  Why don't you guys, here's the keys.
[00:47:10.106 --> 00:47:10.887]  You guys drive it.
[00:47:11.167 --> 00:47:11.948]  You take it for a while.
[00:47:12.615 --> 00:47:14.036]  Every day is Stalingrad.
[00:47:14.216 --> 00:47:18.860]  We're going to have to fight the administrative state here and their rogue element, the deep state.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:28.927]  We're going to have to take down the globalist apparatus to free people from throughout the world, everything from the CCP in Beijing to the World Economic Forum and all the groups that work with them in concert.
[00:47:28.948 --> 00:47:31.089]  So no, there's a war going on.
[00:47:31.129 --> 00:47:31.890]  We understand that.
[00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:35.653]  And we're winning because we actually have more of the people on our side.
[00:47:35.973 --> 00:47:43.559]   But that's why, Alex, as you know, Either forcing you into bankruptcy, putting Steve Bannon in jail, prosecuting President Trump.
[00:47:43.579 --> 00:47:44.941]  It's all part of the same cloth.
[00:47:46.102 --> 00:47:48.264]  It certainly is, and we're not putting a good face on this.
[00:47:48.644 --> 00:47:52.848]  They really are losing all the polls, all the numbers, not just here but worldwide show that.
[00:47:53.809 --> 00:47:57.232]  Where is the best place for people to find your show that they're so scared of?
[00:47:58.642 --> 00:48:02.065]  The easiest way is just go to warham.org or you go to Real America's Voice.
[00:48:02.085 --> 00:48:03.626]  They're our distributor and producer.
[00:48:03.986 --> 00:48:06.247]  So just go to Real America's Voice or go to warham.org.
[00:48:06.308 --> 00:48:08.329]  Either one, you can get all the shows, all the episodes.
[00:48:08.469 --> 00:48:12.172]  Well, you say don't worry about Steve Bannon, but we are going to worry about Steve Bannon.
[00:48:12.252 --> 00:48:14.173]  We'll talk about how people can support you and so much more.
[00:48:14.193 --> 00:48:16.374]  Straight ahead with Steve Bannon, back in 60 seconds.
[00:48:17.315 --> 00:48:21.938]  Steve Bannon, targeted by George Soros and the Deep State, is our guest, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:22.298 --> 00:48:23.319]  Steve Bannon's at the tip of the spear.
[00:48:23.339 --> 00:48:24.260]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:28.103 --> 00:48:30.584]  And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder.
[00:48:31.565 --> 00:48:34.166]  One of the four beasts saying, come and see.
[00:48:34.186 --> 00:48:39.268]  And I saw, and behold, a white horse.
[00:48:40.249 --> 00:48:50.249]  [MUSIC]
[00:48:50.249 --> 00:49:00.249]  [MUSIC]
[00:49:00.175 --> 00:49:03.197]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[00:49:04.037 --> 00:49:08.740]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:14.543]  When the man comes around.
[00:49:15.183 --> 00:49:20.726]  The hairs on your arm will stand up.
[00:49:22.196 --> 00:49:39.996]  [Music]
[00:49:39.996 --> 00:49:46.075]   We didn't ask to be persecuted, but we knew it was going to happen.
[00:49:46.217 --> 00:49:56.122]  And I can tell by Steve Bannon's bearing, he's proud to be an American and follow in the footsteps of his ancestors, who I know were also American patriots, like his father and grandfather and others.
[00:49:56.682 --> 00:50:04.906]  And he's here with us up against Letitia James and the rig courts and George Soros and the Democratic Party and the FBI raids that happened yesterday and the Mar-a-Lago situation and all of it.
[00:50:05.207 --> 00:50:13.102]   So Steve Bannon, Give us what's happening to you, and then the state of America, and the world, and what you think everybody should be doing right now at this critical juncture.
[00:50:14.382 --> 00:50:16.683]  Look, nobody's going to come to save you.
[00:50:17.163 --> 00:50:18.183]  Nobody's going to come to save us.
[00:50:18.404 --> 00:50:19.344]  We have to do it ourselves.
[00:50:20.004 --> 00:50:21.785]  Just like our forefathers had to do.
[00:50:21.885 --> 00:50:23.805]  This is the American story.
[00:50:23.865 --> 00:50:26.686]  This is the lineage of American patriotism, right?
[00:50:26.706 --> 00:50:30.527]  Going all the way back, as you know well, Alex, to the revolutionary generation.
[00:50:31.087 --> 00:50:32.908]  We have to do it ourselves.
[00:50:33.615 --> 00:50:39.222]  That's why, you know, InfoWars, right, has been so big and so powerful and so meaningful.
[00:50:39.242 --> 00:50:40.843]  It's the reason War Room is starting to do it.
[00:50:40.863 --> 00:50:41.604]  Tucker Carlson.
[00:50:41.885 --> 00:50:42.706]  These are platforms.
[00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:46.290]  Remember, Donald Trump, Donald Trump's instrumentality.
[00:50:47.426 --> 00:50:48.527]  If you're in Washington D.C.
[00:50:48.567 --> 00:50:52.470]  or New York City, or Davos, not in the room, not in the deal.
[00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:56.932]  And the American working class, the middle class, have not been in the room since Ronald Reagan.
[00:50:57.292 --> 00:51:00.254]  Donald Trump put you in the room and he put you at the head of the table.
[00:51:00.554 --> 00:51:01.895]  It's the reason they got to take Trump out.
[00:51:02.256 --> 00:51:03.556]  It's the reason for the Mar-a-Lago race.
[00:51:03.616 --> 00:51:04.537]  It's the reason for all of it.
[00:51:04.677 --> 00:51:06.618]  It's the reason they got to put Alex Jones out.
[00:51:07.018 --> 00:51:09.140]  Remember, Alex Jones they're trying to put into bankruptcy right now.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.121]  Multiple cases and things all over the country.
[00:51:11.161 --> 00:51:11.861]  But that's just the first.
[00:51:11.881 --> 00:51:13.783]  They're doing other stuff that Alex Jones doesn't even know about.
[00:51:14.363 --> 00:51:14.583]  Right?
[00:51:14.643 --> 00:51:16.024]  And that he can't even talk about right now.
[00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:17.615]  But it's the same with me.
[00:51:18.156 --> 00:51:23.145]  But if you give up and surrender and stop, right, you could always go do something else.
[00:51:23.726 --> 00:51:25.449]  But that's the definition of a patriot.
[00:51:25.489 --> 00:51:34.842]   Remember, Alex, in the revolutionary generation, only about a third of the nation were on the Patriot side, a third of the nation were hardcore Tories, and about a third were in the middle.
[00:51:35.203 --> 00:51:39.825]  Like every revolution you see, they're going to play both sides and they're going to go to the winner.
[00:51:40.405 --> 00:51:53.272]  Right now you're actually seeing, and this is why Letitia James and the Justice Department, the FBI, the Biden administration are getting crazier, they see the shifting nature of this inclusive nationalism and participatory populism.
[00:51:54.512 --> 00:51:55.673]  They can do the math.
[00:51:55.693 --> 00:51:57.194]  They're very smart and cunning people.
[00:51:57.454 --> 00:52:03.697]  They understand in the great state of Texas, in South Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley, we're going to get now 50% of the Hispanic vote.
[00:52:04.453 --> 00:52:09.438]  They understand that African-American men, more than ever, are starting to come to the MAGA cause.
[00:52:09.678 --> 00:52:20.847]  They see, the other day, this school board in, I think it was Miami-Dade County, voted 8-1 because of pressure on the parents not to have Gay Pride Month in October, where they can use that to groom their children.
[00:52:21.088 --> 00:52:22.289]  That's the Hispanic community.
[00:52:22.569 --> 00:52:23.169]  We're winning.
[00:52:23.209 --> 00:52:24.871]  We're two-thirds of the nation right now.
[00:52:25.191 --> 00:52:29.892]  We just have to get our message out more and get our voices out more and get our votes out more.
[00:52:30.253 --> 00:52:32.013]  Why are they trying to shut down War Room?
[00:52:32.393 --> 00:52:35.214]  Why are they trying to not just put Alex Jones in bankruptcy?
[00:52:35.234 --> 00:52:38.055]  Why are they trying to liquidate everything around Alex Jones?
[00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:46.218]   They understand the more that you have out there with With Infowars and particularly things like the Great Reset book where people can read it.
[00:52:46.558 --> 00:52:53.421]  People that have never heard of Alex Jones's name or if they heard it, hate him, and they read it and go, wow, this guy was saying this 20 and 30 years ago.
[00:52:53.681 --> 00:52:58.723]  This guy's actually been connecting dots, not just on transhumanism, but this kind of global apparatus.
[00:52:58.743 --> 00:53:00.703]  This is not actually a conspiracy theory.
[00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:02.504]  This is actually something that's real.
[00:53:02.864 --> 00:53:03.965]  That's what they want to stop.
[00:53:04.225 --> 00:53:10.491]   And if we sit there and ever blink, if we ever back up an inch, if we ever show any fear, We lose.
[00:53:10.891 --> 00:53:17.773]  And so, remember, we don't have the ability to, we don't have the, we don't have the option of having mistakes.
[00:53:18.534 --> 00:53:21.655]  Everything we have to do is be spot on and hammer every day.
[00:53:22.075 --> 00:53:26.196]  And that's why, look, all the prayers of people around the nation, I really appreciate it.
[00:53:26.216 --> 00:53:31.077]  I had so many, you know, people saying they're praying for me and it's so powerful and the power of prayer is everything.
[00:53:31.538 --> 00:53:33.358]  But pray for our enemies, okay?
[00:53:33.618 --> 00:53:35.319]  Because now we're coming for them.
[00:53:35.539 --> 00:53:38.520]  And we're going to blow them out the ballot box and that's just the start.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:45.668]   Remember, And people who think it's tough times now, you think we've gone through hard times, we've got 10 or 20 years of this.
[00:53:45.708 --> 00:53:46.589]  This is a fourth turning.
[00:53:46.909 --> 00:53:50.654]  And it's not going to end on November 8th, just like it didn't end back in December of 16.
[00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:51.796]  You can't be that naive.
[00:53:52.116 --> 00:53:53.157]  You have to understand.
[00:53:53.478 --> 00:53:57.082]  We're at, as the subtitle of your book says, Alex, it's a war for the world.
[00:53:57.703 --> 00:53:59.724]  It's a war for the entire world.
[00:53:59.764 --> 00:54:01.904]  This is really the Third World War, okay?
[00:54:02.164 --> 00:54:05.586]  This is not going to be fought with bullets, tanks, and guns, at least not now.
[00:54:05.646 --> 00:54:12.028]  The kinetic part of this may get to be later, right, as the forces of oppression come against us, because we're winning right now.
[00:54:12.088 --> 00:54:12.928]  That's what I tell everybody.
[00:54:13.368 --> 00:54:14.629]  It's all about your agency.
[00:54:14.989 --> 00:54:16.070]  It's all about your action.
[00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:17.391]  It's all about your focus.
[00:54:17.871 --> 00:54:19.012]  And we don't need everybody.
[00:54:19.092 --> 00:54:23.075]  If this is too much for you, and I say this to people all the time, if this is too hard or too tough, that's fine.
[00:54:23.415 --> 00:54:23.795]  That's fine.
[00:54:23.955 --> 00:54:27.898]  Just stay off to the side until you see us start to win, and then jump back on board.
[00:54:27.938 --> 00:54:33.281]  But for those that are patriots, those that sit there and go, hey, if this was the Revolutionary War, I'd have been at Saratoga.
[00:54:33.301 --> 00:54:35.503]  If this was the Revolutionary War, I'd have been at Trenton.
[00:54:35.783 --> 00:54:38.105]  If this was the Revolutionary War, I'd have been at Valley Forge.
[00:54:38.305 --> 00:54:41.307]  Well, this is your Revolutionary War, right here and right now.
[00:54:41.747 --> 00:54:42.928]  And now's the time to sign up.
[00:54:43.288 --> 00:54:43.828]  And what do you do?
[00:54:43.868 --> 00:54:46.250]  You become a force multiplier.
[00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:48.431]  Just become a force multiplier.
[00:54:48.491 --> 00:54:49.151]  Do that first.
[00:54:49.631 --> 00:54:50.372]  Use your agency.
[00:54:50.692 --> 00:54:51.372]  And we're going to win this.
[00:54:51.432 --> 00:54:53.953]  We know we're on the side of the righteous.
[00:54:54.354 --> 00:54:55.914]  We know we have the issues on our side.
[00:54:56.194 --> 00:54:58.476]  Did they ever come in and debate Alex Jones and the issues?
[00:54:58.496 --> 00:55:01.137]  Have you ever heard any guy come and really debate Alex Jones and the issue?
[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:02.180]  No.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.121]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:55:04.321 --> 00:55:05.181]  We've got to bankrupt him.
[00:55:05.321 --> 00:55:06.381]  We've got to liquidate the company.
[00:55:06.401 --> 00:55:07.581]  We've got to throw him off all media.
[00:55:07.721 --> 00:55:09.942]  Does anybody ever come and try to... They're going to debate Steve Bannon.
[00:55:10.002 --> 00:55:12.843]  I've debated the top guys in the world, all over the world, and crushed them every time.
[00:55:12.863 --> 00:55:14.863]  They're not going to sit there and debate, right?
[00:55:15.223 --> 00:55:22.085]  Bernard Levy from up in Canada and Toronto, Levy, Bernard Levy in Athens.
[00:55:22.425 --> 00:55:23.625]  I'd blow these guys off the stage.
[00:55:23.645 --> 00:55:24.905]  They're not going to debate us, Alex.
[00:55:25.225 --> 00:55:36.411]   What they're going to try to do is not just de-platform us, And Steve, before you went on live, you said, I don't want to talk about myself.
[00:55:36.431 --> 00:55:37.752]  I want to talk about everybody.
[00:55:37.792 --> 00:55:39.873]  But I differ in that one area.
[00:55:40.353 --> 00:55:41.514]  You're a champion for liberty.
[00:55:41.554 --> 00:55:47.034]   You were the main brain trust with Trump that really got a lot of the great gains of freedom
[00:55:47.034 --> 00:55:51.954]   and liberty and anti-globalism in that first few years where they distracted Trump with
[00:55:51.954 --> 00:55:52.954]  the Russiagate stuff.
[00:55:52.954 --> 00:55:58.753]   And they see you like the Romans would have a standard that was their logo, was their
[00:55:58.753 --> 00:55:59.753]  symbol of victory.
[00:55:59.753 --> 00:56:02.034]  And if the enemy could capture that, that was a big victory.
[00:56:02.034 --> 00:56:05.753]   There's some famous cases of the Germans capturing one and a whole war starting.
[00:56:05.753 --> 00:56:10.114]   They see you as like a Roman eagle standard that they want to get.
[00:56:10.114 --> 00:56:11.514]  And it's a rallying point.
[00:56:11.514 --> 00:56:12.954]  They can get you, they can get us all.
[00:56:12.954 --> 00:56:14.874]  So we need to stand with you.
[00:56:14.874 --> 00:56:15.874]  We need to support you.
[00:56:15.874 --> 00:56:16.874]  We need to back you.
[00:56:16.874 --> 00:56:19.394]   Because I know they've been trying to run you to ground like us.
[00:56:19.359 --> 00:56:20.660]  How do we support the War Room?
[00:56:20.941 --> 00:56:22.903]  How do we support one of our main champions?
[00:56:23.928 --> 00:56:32.714]  I think, look, it's very simple for your audience to just go to Worm.org or go to Rumble or go to Real America's Voice, any of our distribution partners, and just watch the show.
[00:56:32.774 --> 00:56:34.775]  All we ask is that you, it's all free.
[00:56:34.795 --> 00:56:35.115]  And share it.
[00:56:35.155 --> 00:56:36.636]  You know, we don't have any paywall or anything.
[00:56:37.016 --> 00:56:37.497]  Just share it.
[00:56:37.797 --> 00:56:38.577]  All we want to share.
[00:56:38.797 --> 00:56:43.500]  Listen, one of the things I find most powerful is I see Alex Jones' content everywhere and different things.
[00:56:43.821 --> 00:56:44.781]  That means we're winning.
[00:56:45.061 --> 00:56:47.943]  They can't shut it down because they can't stop this content.
[00:56:47.983 --> 00:56:53.187]   And they understand that the more people that see the content, Look, they've taken Alex Jones off of everything.
[00:56:53.568 --> 00:56:55.249]  Your content's still out there bigger than ever.
[00:56:55.529 --> 00:56:57.191]  They try to shut War Room down off everything.
[00:56:57.231 --> 00:57:00.374]  YouTube and Facebook and Twitter and all of it.
[00:57:00.594 --> 00:57:01.435]  And we're bigger than ever.
[00:57:01.675 --> 00:57:02.256]  Because why?
[00:57:02.296 --> 00:57:04.297]  The audience is sharing it.
[00:57:04.317 --> 00:57:14.806]   And we're going to break one more segment, but I want to just show some video for TV viewers, radio listeners, go to the War Room on your site and see a great video people put together with the Very powerful.
[00:57:14.626 --> 00:57:20.066]   around your song Johnny Cash, but the way you looked in that courtroom
[00:57:20.066 --> 00:57:25.045]   just absolutely looked energized and not even defiant, but I just, it's an image of victory.
[00:57:25.045 --> 00:57:30.246]   And instead of being defeated at that point, I just see a man that knows he's where he was supposed to
[00:57:30.246 --> 00:57:31.525]   be, where he wanted to be.
[00:57:31.525 --> 00:57:35.665]   Can you speak for 30 seconds on how you were feeling in that kangaroo court?
[00:57:35.665 --> 00:57:36.505]  Very powerful.
[00:57:36.505 --> 00:57:38.185]  It was one of the best days of my life.
[00:57:38.185 --> 00:57:41.426]   I tell you, I had a chance to visit with some of the officers and stuff.
[00:57:41.007 --> 00:57:42.268]  There's so many MAGA people.
[00:57:42.488 --> 00:57:43.709]  There's so many people that are afraid.
[00:57:43.769 --> 00:57:45.169]  They have to be because of their jobs.
[00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:46.290]  We're winning.
[00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:48.711]  The people behind the scenes support us.
[00:57:48.851 --> 00:57:49.271]  Trust me.
[00:57:49.692 --> 00:57:51.613]  This is, this is, we are winning.
[00:57:51.773 --> 00:57:52.333]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:57:52.353 --> 00:57:54.314]  We have two-thirds of the American people in back of us.
[00:57:54.354 --> 00:57:55.555]  Well, Steve, I'm going to say this right now.
[00:57:55.575 --> 00:57:59.637]  I'm going to put a t-shirt out with that face, that look is just victory.
[00:57:59.877 --> 00:58:05.726]   I'm going to paint a whole wall in our office with you on it because that look just, just, It's victory.
[00:58:05.766 --> 00:58:06.266]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:06.687 --> 00:58:07.987]  Steve Bannon's our guest.
[00:58:08.787 --> 00:58:09.768]  One final segment.
[00:58:09.788 --> 00:58:11.588]  Then, Andrew Tate coming up.
[00:58:12.369 --> 00:58:15.630]  Next segment, number one Google man in the world.
[00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:18.351]  And boy, we got some big announcements coming soon.
[00:58:18.391 --> 00:58:21.612]  Andrew Tate and I just look for that in the next coming weeks.
[00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:30.531]  Freedom is popular, the globalists are in trouble, and they think they can target the leaders of the human resistance to this tyranny and we'll just go away, or it'll intimidate others.
[00:58:31.031 --> 00:58:35.054]  This is our chance to shine and measure up to our amazing ancestors.
[00:58:35.074 --> 00:58:40.378]  Steve Manning, you are always on fire, but you are particularly on fire, and I just admire the incredible work you're doing.
[00:58:40.718 --> 00:58:45.642]  In the closing eight minutes we have left before you've got to go, please continue to give everybody their marching orders.
[00:58:46.519 --> 00:58:54.771]  Well, the one that March, remember yesterday, the irony was when I was in New York City about the wall, Mayor Adams had a delegation down.
[00:58:54.812 --> 00:58:56.434]  Remember, he's made it a sanctuary city.
[00:58:56.855 --> 00:58:59.018]  So they're being inundated right now with illegal.
[00:58:59.654 --> 00:59:05.541]  Aliens are unauthorized and unapproved personages that are here.
[00:59:06.102 --> 00:59:11.068]  We've had 4.9 million in the first 18 months of the Biden regime.
[00:59:11.348 --> 00:59:17.595]  The New York Times even reports there's a million in the asylum program that won't even be dealt with for an average of five to seven years.
[00:59:17.616 --> 00:59:19.478]  And they're going to live here with all these benefits.
[00:59:20.038 --> 00:59:22.741]  Adam sent a delegation down to find out about the border.
[00:59:22.781 --> 00:59:28.466]  The mayor of D.C., because the National Guard won't come out, is declaring a state of emergency in D.C.
[00:59:28.486 --> 00:59:30.328]  because of being inundated about this, right?
[00:59:30.768 --> 00:59:35.433]  So, one of the things that drives him crazy is that, yes, this was a civilian movement.
[00:59:35.453 --> 00:59:45.602]   We understood we couldn't build the whole wall, but this was symbolically to help Trump, when Nancy Pelosi first took over as Speaker of the House, and shut down any ability of the Trump administration to build a wall.
[00:59:45.862 --> 00:59:53.789]  And if you saw the movie, I think it's Sicario, about El Paso and Juarez, that's exactly where we built that first amazing mile of wall.
[00:59:53.809 --> 00:59:57.653]  For those that don't know, I know Delta Force guys that were involved, that movie Sicario is a true story.
[00:59:58.536 --> 00:59:59.237]  It's a true story.
[00:59:59.257 --> 01:00:00.457]  By the way, everybody should watch it.
[01:00:00.477 --> 01:00:10.805]  If you want to see what we did on the wall, we built right at the number one place with the human traffic and with the drug traffic coming from Juarez into El Paso, up the side of that mountain, is where we built the wall.
[01:00:11.005 --> 01:00:13.227]  And we built it in four days over Memorial Day.
[01:00:13.447 --> 01:00:14.608]  This is what drove them crazy.
[01:00:14.648 --> 01:00:15.469]  They tried to shut it down.
[01:00:15.509 --> 01:00:15.949]  They couldn't.
[01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:23.232]  Remember, if you believe in the sovereignty of your nation, if you will fight for the sovereignty of your nation, they are out to destroy you.
[01:00:23.573 --> 01:00:28.375]  And that's why the people at the tip of the spear, they're going to try to destroy as symbols to scare you off.
[01:00:28.655 --> 01:00:29.816]  But it's you they're coming for.
[01:00:30.176 --> 01:00:38.120]  They want to either have you arrested or take all your money or psychologically have you just surrender and say, you know what, I'm going to go play golf.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.620]  I'm just going to hang out at the beach.
[01:00:39.961 --> 01:00:42.951]   If you do that, The country is over.
[01:00:42.971 --> 01:00:43.871]  There's no doubt.
[01:00:43.891 --> 01:00:49.695]  This is not about, like I said, Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, or Alex Jones.
[01:00:49.735 --> 01:00:50.416]  This is about you.
[01:00:50.556 --> 01:00:51.656]  This is a populist movement.
[01:00:51.676 --> 01:00:53.718]  This is an inclusive nationalist movement.
[01:00:53.978 --> 01:00:57.440]  They understand throughout the world you're seeing it happening in Italy right now with Giorgia Maloney.
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.001]  You're seeing it happening this Sunday.
[01:00:59.381 --> 01:01:10.268]  In Sweden, with the Swedish Democrats, they had Greta Thunberg out today campaigning on this ridiculous transition of green energy, which is supposed to bankrupt us all.
[01:01:10.548 --> 01:01:14.390]  And that's why I think, as a framing device, I'm so proud of the great reset you've got.
[01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:16.972]  If you understand, hey, how did this all come about?
[01:01:17.092 --> 01:01:19.353]  What is this great war for the world?
[01:01:19.653 --> 01:01:28.699]  That's why, Alex, I think your book is fantastic as a primer to get everybody up to speed, to then understand we must win and we must win at the ballot box.
[01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:31.282]  We can do that November 8th, but that's just the start.
[01:01:31.322 --> 01:01:33.724]  Like I said, this is our 10 or 20 year project.
[01:01:33.964 --> 01:01:35.887]  It took us 50 or 60 years to get here.
[01:01:36.247 --> 01:01:37.849]  It's going to take us 20 years to get out.
[01:01:37.969 --> 01:01:38.509]  I totally agree.
[01:01:39.688 --> 01:01:47.357]  I totally agree, and since you mentioned the Great Recession and the War of the World that you've championed, and I really appreciate you reading it, it's mainly, it was easy to write, it's their quotes, it's their battle plan.
[01:01:47.737 --> 01:01:50.540]  What if people would have read Mein Kampf that Hitler wrote?
[01:01:50.961 --> 01:01:52.463]  Everything he said in the book, he did.
[01:01:52.723 --> 01:01:54.084]  Well, this is their Mein Kampf.
[01:01:54.525 --> 01:01:57.688]  So this is their admissions right here, this is their confessions.
[01:01:57.949 --> 01:01:59.751]  That's why I call it the blueprint of the Death Star.
[01:02:00.928 --> 01:02:02.289]  No, listen, here's the beauty of the book.
[01:02:02.649 --> 01:02:03.909]  You actually quote them at length.
[01:02:03.949 --> 01:02:09.992]  You take a couple of the top books, you take a couple of the top thinkers, you tie it all together, and this is what people have to understand.
[01:02:10.272 --> 01:02:13.954]  Look, once you read this, you'll understand what we're up against, okay?
[01:02:14.154 --> 01:02:19.196]  You'll understand exactly what this apparatus, you know, what Alex calls it, the Death Star.
[01:02:19.356 --> 01:02:21.897]  But you understand what we're up against, and we're not going to back off this.
[01:02:21.937 --> 01:02:22.758]  We can't back off it.
[01:02:22.778 --> 01:02:25.459]   The United States It's actually the centerpiece of this battle.
[01:02:25.699 --> 01:02:32.381]  Because they understand, just like in the Revolutionary War, if they can take the liberty and freedom of American citizens, they can take it anywhere.
[01:02:32.681 --> 01:02:34.061]  And that's why you have to fight back.
[01:02:34.101 --> 01:02:36.962]  And by the way, Alex, I not just read it, I tell everybody, get a pen.
[01:02:36.982 --> 01:02:38.343]  I always get my great pens here.
[01:02:38.603 --> 01:02:40.824]  I had my pen and I'm underlining everything.
[01:02:40.984 --> 01:02:41.944]  And here's the beauty of it.
[01:02:42.144 --> 01:02:43.244]  You footnote everything.
[01:02:43.284 --> 01:02:44.905]  This is not Alex Jones's opinions.
[01:02:45.325 --> 01:02:47.987]  What Alex Jones' team has done is pull it all together.
[01:02:48.287 --> 01:02:49.488]  It's all referenced right there.
[01:02:49.528 --> 01:02:50.528]  You can go to a footnote.
[01:02:50.768 --> 01:02:52.710]  I know you've got an online site about it, too.
[01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:56.212]  That's why I think Tony Lyons and the guys at Skyhorse did such a great job.
[01:02:56.252 --> 01:02:56.632]  But listen.
[01:02:57.268 --> 01:03:02.429]  Once you read this book, you understand why the Alex Joneses and the Steve Bannons are not going to back off.
[01:03:02.449 --> 01:03:04.030]  There's all kinds of other things we could do.
[01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:05.890]  There's all kinds of other things Trump could do.
[01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:07.611]  There's all kinds of other things Tucker Carlson could do.
[01:03:07.931 --> 01:03:10.852]  We're all in this fight, and we're never going to back off one inch.
[01:03:10.932 --> 01:03:12.672]  And we don't care what they try to do.
[01:03:12.712 --> 01:03:17.634]  As I told them yesterday, hey, and I know you've been swatted all the time, Alex, and never talk about it.
[01:03:17.654 --> 01:03:18.514]  People don't understand.
[01:03:19.114 --> 01:03:22.776]  The pressure that Alex Jones and others like him are under behind the scenes.
[01:03:23.077 --> 01:03:24.357]  He's been swatted so many times.
[01:03:24.618 --> 01:03:28.700]  I got swatted, what, four times in, what, ten days, two weeks, a couple of weeks.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.781]  And those are, sir, they're trying to kill you by cop.
[01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:31.862]  It's not the police's fault.
[01:03:31.902 --> 01:03:33.283]  The police are coming there to do their job.
[01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:34.984]  But they wanted to make you one false move.
[01:03:35.024 --> 01:03:38.646]  Marjorie Taylor Greene, as you know, she sleeps with an AR-15 in her bedroom.
[01:03:38.966 --> 01:03:46.691]   If she had come the first night to that door, like she normally would if she hears noise outside, and had her AR-15 out, Marjorie Taylor Greene be done.
[01:03:46.811 --> 01:03:48.692]  They'd have done and dusted her right there.
[01:03:48.712 --> 01:03:49.772]  She'd be graveyard dead.
[01:03:50.173 --> 01:03:50.433]  Okay?
[01:03:50.673 --> 01:03:51.513]  That's what they're trying to do.
[01:03:51.553 --> 01:03:53.014]  They're trying to assassinate you.
[01:03:53.354 --> 01:03:54.455]  They're trying to bankrupt you.
[01:03:54.475 --> 01:03:55.836]  They're trying to liquidate you.
[01:03:56.116 --> 01:03:57.116]  They're trying to imprison you.
[01:03:57.457 --> 01:04:03.260]  And hey, if you ever show any fear of your show, oh my gosh, they are going to run the table.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.541]  So now's our revolutionary generation moment.
[01:04:05.861 --> 01:04:08.022]  Let's make those men and women proud of us.
[01:04:08.082 --> 01:04:12.465]  Those men and women that actually fought off the greatest empire of the world at the time.
[01:04:12.805 --> 01:04:16.727]  For the freedom of this country and pass it down for what, 14 generations?
[01:04:17.167 --> 01:04:18.608]  Okay, now it's our time to stand up.
[01:04:18.628 --> 01:04:19.009]  This is our moment.
[01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.309]  That's right.
[01:04:19.329 --> 01:04:20.609]  It's a historic crossroads.
[01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:24.432]  And if you study the New World Order, the globalists, it's much worse to submit to them.
[01:04:24.472 --> 01:04:26.593]  So there's really no choice but to fight that.
[01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:28.334]  But you called yesterday the best day of your life.
[01:04:28.794 --> 01:04:31.415]  You just, extremely iconic.
[01:04:31.796 --> 01:04:35.578]  Al Pacino couldn't, you know, radiate that much charisma or confidence.
[01:04:36.138 --> 01:04:39.541]  You're a confident guy, but you're not normally being, you know, arrogant, displaying your will.
[01:04:39.861 --> 01:04:40.942]  What was happening in that courtroom?
[01:04:40.962 --> 01:04:44.725]  Because I'll just say it, you look extremely energized and powerful right there.
[01:04:45.986 --> 01:04:48.508]  I just think, look, I'm a big believer in the Holy Spirit.
[01:04:48.768 --> 01:04:51.930]  That was a very spiritual moment the whole day was for me.
[01:04:51.970 --> 01:04:53.892]  Just very calm and collected and very focused.
[01:04:53.912 --> 01:04:56.133]  I understand, hey, we're over the target now.
[01:04:56.173 --> 01:04:57.534]  We're never going to back off this way.
[01:04:57.575 --> 01:04:58.295]  Never going to back off.
[01:04:58.315 --> 01:04:59.936]  This is what they're trying to do for President Trump.
[01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:01.578]  Remember what they did yesterday.
[01:05:01.598 --> 01:05:02.158]  And Alex was right.
[01:05:02.178 --> 01:05:03.339]  They want to get the guys around it.
[01:05:03.679 --> 01:05:03.819]  Right?
[01:05:03.859 --> 01:05:07.623]  And they particularly want to get the guys that have platforms around it because they want to choke him off.
[01:05:08.584 --> 01:05:10.005]  Listen, Mar-a-Lago failed.
[01:05:10.245 --> 01:05:11.346]  They're not going to win on appeal.
[01:05:11.386 --> 01:05:12.747]  Mar-a-Lago thing is done.
[01:05:13.128 --> 01:05:13.408]  Okay?
[01:05:13.608 --> 01:05:18.533]  That's why they sent 35 FBI guys out yesterday to start to roll up other people for another grand jury.
[01:05:18.893 --> 01:05:20.535]  They are demonic right now.
[01:05:20.975 --> 01:05:22.877]  Just go back and watch Biden's speech.
[01:05:23.377 --> 01:05:27.419]  That is the most disgraceful speech, Alex, as you've said, in the history of this country.
[01:05:27.739 --> 01:05:34.161]  In the form of sacrilege, and really, where the Declaration of Independence was both drafted and negotiated.
[01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:35.021]  He was pissing on 1776.
[01:05:37.856 --> 01:05:40.137]  Right there, in front of the whole nation with that demonic red.
[01:05:41.497 --> 01:05:46.679]  By the way, those are all signals to his buddies on a global basis, right?
[01:05:46.939 --> 01:05:54.481]  To bathe the greatest sanctuary of liberty, Independence Hall, with the Constitution and the Declaration on the greatest nation of freedom in the world.
[01:05:54.501 --> 01:05:55.882]  They're freeing more people than anybody in the world.
[01:05:56.142 --> 01:06:00.383]  To bathe that in that blood red, a disgrace, and we're never backing down on that demon.
[01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:02.551]  And then his speech was, we're the enemy.
[01:06:02.591 --> 01:06:03.472]  He did it again yesterday.
[01:06:03.772 --> 01:06:07.975]  He said Republican voters and Trump voters are the enemy and are terrorists.
[01:06:08.295 --> 01:06:11.718]  I'm really concerned we're out of time with false flags in the next 60 days before the election.
[01:06:12.018 --> 01:06:14.339]  Steve, how long are you going to be out before this fiasco?
[01:06:14.359 --> 01:06:16.401]  Because I want to get you back as soon as possible.
[01:06:17.443 --> 01:06:19.445]  I'm gonna be, hey, I'm not going anywhere.
[01:06:19.625 --> 01:06:24.829]  Anytime, any day, I'm a big, I watch I Corps Commander every day, Alex Jones, so just tell me when.
[01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:29.472]  Warroom.org, everybody get there and support Steve Bannon, get his books, all his material.
[01:06:29.492 --> 01:06:31.153]  If you don't support Steve Bannon, you're not supporting yourself.
[01:06:31.414 --> 01:06:32.775]  Steve, amazing, thank you so much, sir.
[01:06:33.755 --> 01:06:34.276]  Thank you, brother.
[01:06:34.836 --> 01:06:38.059]  Anytime I'm depressed or down now, I'm just gonna pull that video of Steve Bannon in court.
[01:06:38.419 --> 01:06:39.279]  Man, that's incredible.
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.040]  Thank you, Steve.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.262]  Alright, Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:51.206]  He is the most prominent scientist and medical researcher to first expose vaccines and their connection to all these health problems decades ago.
[01:06:51.246 --> 01:06:53.868]  And he got destroyed but rebuilt because the truth came out.
[01:06:53.908 --> 01:06:55.349]  They'd rigged everything against him.
[01:06:56.769 --> 01:07:06.475]  So that's coming up in studio next hour, but look at this image of Steve Bannon when he is in there being set up for money laundering and all this crap with his charity giving 95% to actually build the wall.
[01:07:06.775 --> 01:07:07.715]  Oh my God, the charity took 5%.
[01:07:08.256 --> 01:07:08.676]  How evil.
[01:07:08.996 --> 01:07:11.558]  Bono takes 99% and gives 1%.
[01:07:12.618 --> 01:07:16.381]  I mean, it's just ridiculous that this has gone on, but that's what's happening.
[01:07:17.261 --> 01:07:25.246]  But Andrew Tate, we did a big interview yesterday where it's going to air on Monday, like a documentary with a bunch of clips and added factoids and information.
[01:07:25.919 --> 01:07:26.700]  It's going to be a big interview.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.060]  He's the most Googled guy in the world.
[01:07:28.661 --> 01:07:29.902]  And I've known him for many, many years.
[01:07:30.382 --> 01:07:31.183]  He's hosted the show.
[01:07:31.203 --> 01:07:32.063]  He's come to Austin.
[01:07:32.423 --> 01:07:33.384]  I know him and his brother well.
[01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:34.725]  Paul Watson's really good friends with him.
[01:07:35.285 --> 01:07:37.107]  And they're scared of him.
[01:07:37.627 --> 01:07:38.748]  And they're lying about who he is.
[01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:39.788]  So I want to play these clips.
[01:07:40.809 --> 01:07:41.850]  We got four different clips.
[01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:43.731]  We're just going to play these back to back.
[01:07:44.292 --> 01:07:49.695]  Here's some of the excerpts of the hour-long interview that's going to drop live on the show Monday.
[01:07:49.735 --> 01:07:51.376]  But take these clips and share them everywhere.
[01:07:51.737 --> 01:07:53.258]  Everything we have is copyright free.
[01:07:54.679 --> 01:07:55.099]  Free to air.
[01:07:56.013 --> 01:08:00.534]  Take these clips and get them out to the world because Andrew Tate's the most cool guy in the world.
[01:08:00.554 --> 01:08:07.676]  His information is liberating and is empowering and we can get folks to come to InfoWars by promoting this.
[01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:11.037]  And we got a lot of great stuff with Andrew Tate that's coming up.
[01:08:11.497 --> 01:08:14.973]   Let's just say this, we're going to join forces In the near future.
[01:08:14.993 --> 01:08:15.893]  And I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:08:15.953 --> 01:08:17.074]  You'll hear about the next few weeks.
[01:08:18.035 --> 01:08:20.096]  But it's on like Donkey Kong.
[01:08:20.577 --> 01:08:21.437]  We'll play these clips.
[01:08:21.477 --> 01:08:25.040]  I'll hit a bunch of other big breaking news here on this live Friday edition.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.641]  But here are some preludes.
[01:08:27.681 --> 01:08:28.822]  Here are some hors d'oeuvres.
[01:08:29.523 --> 01:08:32.665]  Here is kind of the pre-show of what's coming up on Monday.
[01:08:33.345 --> 01:08:35.587]  I'm really concerned about false flags ahead of the midterms.
[01:08:36.348 --> 01:08:38.509]  We already see them cutting the power off all over the world.
[01:08:38.909 --> 01:08:43.079]   They said we're going to Go big with environmentalism and power outages in the undercover.
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.865]  Video from Project Veritas about eight months ago.
[01:08:45.945 --> 01:08:47.147]  We now see that happening.
[01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:51.676]  How do you see these control freaks striking back?
[01:08:53.223 --> 01:08:54.264]  Well, this is what's scary.
[01:08:54.284 --> 01:08:57.666]  It's because power and energy is the absolute base for any country on the planet.
[01:08:57.686 --> 01:08:59.827]  If you don't have energy or power, you have nothing else.
[01:08:59.887 --> 01:09:00.768]  You don't have security.
[01:09:00.808 --> 01:09:01.568]  You don't have safety.
[01:09:01.588 --> 01:09:02.589]  You don't have food production.
[01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:04.190]  You don't have absolutely anything.
[01:09:04.530 --> 01:09:07.872]  So they're going down to the very, very core and very, very crux of humanity now.
[01:09:08.313 --> 01:09:13.156]  Once power outages start becoming a mainstream thing, it's not just about not being able to turn on your television.
[01:09:13.176 --> 01:09:14.097]  It's about crime.
[01:09:14.477 --> 01:09:16.678]  It's about people dying on the street.
[01:09:17.078 --> 01:09:18.860]  It's about emergency services.
[01:09:18.979 --> 01:09:20.658]  It's about food production.
[01:09:20.658 --> 01:09:24.698]   It's about so many more important things and it's truly evil.
[01:09:24.698 --> 01:09:28.379]   But when you get insulated like these people are at the level they're at, completely insulated
[01:09:28.379 --> 01:09:33.019]   from the consequences of their own actions, they're prepared to sacrifice a few palms
[01:09:33.019 --> 01:09:35.899]  in their own mind to try and win the chess game.
[01:09:35.899 --> 01:09:36.899]  And that's what they see us as.
[01:09:36.915 --> 01:09:38.716]  They see us as disposable and expendable.
[01:09:39.316 --> 01:09:41.037]  And yes, we're living in 2022.
[01:09:41.098 --> 01:09:46.321]  We're living in a society and a world which is very, very technologically advanced.
[01:09:46.601 --> 01:09:49.243]  There is no reason for anywhere to be running out of power.
[01:09:49.303 --> 01:09:50.744]  We've had electricity for long enough.
[01:09:51.064 --> 01:09:56.728]  And when that starts happening, to believe it's some kind of accident or coincidence is asinine.
[01:09:57.168 --> 01:10:10.530]  It is impossible in the current world we live in with all the current resource and all the smart people on the planet and the fact that we all know we need electricity and the fact that we had all the electricity we needed in the 80s to now be here 40 or 50 years later and say we can't generate electricity.
[01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:12.771]  That is clown world fantasy.
[01:10:14.231 --> 01:10:15.971]  And the globalists said they were going to cut the power off.
[01:10:15.991 --> 01:10:19.032]  They cut off thousands of coal power plants here alone while China builds three a week.
[01:10:19.532 --> 01:10:24.533]  I think that it's very, very important that we understand if we do not hang together, we will hang one by one.
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:29.402]  And it's important for people to sit here and think, well, he got banned.
[01:10:29.542 --> 01:10:31.002]  Maybe he was too extreme.
[01:10:31.062 --> 01:10:32.063]  This guy got banned.
[01:10:32.183 --> 01:10:34.544]  Maybe he said this one bad thing once.
[01:10:34.924 --> 01:10:35.764]  He got banned.
[01:10:36.084 --> 01:10:37.305]  Maybe the media has a point.
[01:10:37.625 --> 01:10:38.425]  They don't have a point.
[01:10:38.905 --> 01:10:44.647]   If they had a genuine point, And they weren't afraid of open debate and discourse, then nobody would be getting banned at all.
[01:10:45.027 --> 01:10:51.610]  And they're pushing things far too close to the barrier, and they're doing that on purpose because they fear different ideas.
[01:10:52.150 --> 01:10:58.992]  I do believe that God has a plan for the world, and his plan is not to allow these people to completely and utterly burn it to the ground.
[01:10:59.512 --> 01:11:08.198]  I do believe that we're in a period of a redemption arc for humanity and things have gotten dark now but a ball always hits the bottom before it bounces to the top.
[01:11:08.618 --> 01:11:28.932]  But it's very important the people who are awake and the people who understand not only try and educate as many people as possible but also support each other and also support the leaders like yourself and like myself who are out here taking on the risk and the responsibility of being completely deplatformed, depersoned, having serious threats on our safety and security to try and tell the truth.
[01:11:29.772 --> 01:11:36.977]  It's been a very interesting few years and we've seen what happens when people don't have a voice and don't stand up and try and repel against these systems.
[01:11:37.457 --> 01:11:44.102]  I really do think that the acts that have happened across these last few years in the name of trying to save lives for COVID have been genuinely, genuinely criminal.
[01:11:44.482 --> 01:11:48.805]  And I don't think they would have tested this kind of system or tested this kind of censorship and repression.
[01:11:49.145 --> 01:11:51.205]  To just stop it and go back to normal.
[01:11:51.546 --> 01:11:59.947]  I think it was a test of a system and they intend on coming in harder than ever before with some new story and some new excuse later on down the line.
[01:12:00.287 --> 01:12:05.448]  And it gets to a point where you finally have to stand up and realize that you cannot run from what is going to come to you.
[01:12:05.768 --> 01:12:06.709]  You cannot escape it.
[01:12:06.729 --> 01:12:07.609]  You cannot hide.
[01:12:07.909 --> 01:12:08.949]  You cannot deny it.
[01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:12.770]  You get to a point where you understand you need to find people who are like-minded and stand up.
[01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:20.652]  And the best way you can stand up at this current point in time is just to educate others and just to highlight the injustices which are being purported by these systems.
[01:12:21.152 --> 01:12:23.112]  My banning was absolutely and utterly unjust.
[01:12:23.292 --> 01:12:24.553]  I never broke any terms of service.
[01:12:24.973 --> 01:12:25.533]  They know that.
[01:12:25.793 --> 01:12:26.973]  The whole world knows that now.
[01:12:27.513 --> 01:12:29.434]  And the public sentiment is on my side.
[01:12:29.874 --> 01:12:39.356]  And the more people talk about this and the more people discuss this and tell others and educate others, the harder it's going to be for them to keep this curtain, this iron curtain of theirs, over the truth.
[01:12:39.816 --> 01:12:41.317]  Because that's all they truly want to do.
[01:12:41.718 --> 01:12:42.879]  They have shut us down.
[01:12:42.959 --> 01:12:49.744]  This is warfare against the West because the Western ideal cannot operate when the globalists have all these other countries under slavery.
[01:12:49.964 --> 01:12:54.307]  People will aspire to Western freedom and so it has to be gotten rid of.
[01:12:54.327 --> 01:12:54.948]  Can you speak to that?
[01:12:56.474 --> 01:13:01.276]  Oh yeah, completely and utterly, and they have to change society and change the basis on which society is run.
[01:13:01.616 --> 01:13:04.477]  Society was run in the West on the premise of freedom.
[01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:08.598]  You can come to the West and if you comply with the law, we will provide you with freedom.
[01:13:08.938 --> 01:13:13.580]  They've realized that, like you said, that doesn't give them enough control, and that's what tyrants are obsessed with.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:19.182]  So they want to replace freedom with safety, because it's the only thing that people will accept their freedom being taken away for.
[01:13:19.202 --> 01:13:22.083]  We're going to take all your freedom away, but don't worry, you're going to be safe.
[01:13:22.423 --> 01:13:23.964]  You'll be safe from the common cold.
[01:13:24.244 --> 01:13:25.685]  You'll be safe from whatever else.
[01:13:26.045 --> 01:13:28.567]  So they're trying to destroy our freedoms and replace it with safety.
[01:13:28.607 --> 01:13:33.390]  Now, to replace freedom with safety, you need to convince people that they're in danger.
[01:13:33.671 --> 01:13:34.431]  How do you do that?
[01:13:34.731 --> 01:13:47.860]  Well, you either create a media spin and convince everyone the common cold is somehow deadly, or what you can do is you can cause blackouts, cause mass crime rates to increase, cause mass famine, and put people in danger for real.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:52.203]  Because when they're in real danger and they're really scared, then they'll really sign up for safety.
[01:13:52.503 --> 01:14:01.951]  If there's only going to be one town in the whole state that has electricity, you're going to agree with whatever piece of paper they make you sign, whatever rules you have to agree to, you're going to agree to get in.
[01:14:02.211 --> 01:14:03.172]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[01:14:04.092 --> 01:14:04.753]  And they admit that.
[01:14:05.313 --> 01:14:19.124]  Club of Rome, Bilderberg Group, and its spokesperson, Klaus Schwab, WEF, says, we're going to get rid of the old system, that's the great reset, to build back better, and you're going to have a universal basic income with program tokens that tell you where and how and when you can spend that money.
[01:14:19.264 --> 01:14:20.966]  I mean, that is beyond the mark of the beast.
[01:14:22.344 --> 01:14:28.006]  Oh absolutely, because if anybody understands the world, understands that every single system on the planet is absolutely and utterly corrupt.
[01:14:28.426 --> 01:14:33.448]  The judicial system's corrupt, the law system's corrupt, the medical systems are now corrupted, everything's corrupt.
[01:14:33.468 --> 01:14:36.629]  So any system that involves humanity at any level is going to have a degree of corruption.
[01:14:36.649 --> 01:14:43.392]  And if you think they're going to give you these tokens and it's going to be somehow fair and non-corrupt, you are an idealist at best and an idiot at worst.
[01:14:43.732 --> 01:14:45.072]  Probably a combination of the two.
[01:14:45.453 --> 01:14:53.917]   I often say to people, If you go to a poker game and there's no referee and there's $5,000 at stake, do you think people would cheat without any kind of referee?
[01:14:53.957 --> 01:14:55.477]  And people say, well, yeah, probably.
[01:14:55.818 --> 01:15:08.784]  So if you understand that people will cheat in a poker game or a basketball game for menial amounts of money without any kind of judge or referee, how are you going to sit and then believe that the most powerful people on the planet to control nations and control entire populaces are not going to cheat and bend the rules?
[01:15:09.084 --> 01:15:09.664]  Of course they are.
[01:15:09.724 --> 01:15:10.385]  This is human nature.
[01:15:10.405 --> 01:15:11.565]  That's absolutely what they're going to do.
[01:15:11.785 --> 01:15:12.846]  They're not going to risk losing.
[01:15:13.286 --> 01:15:15.872]  So they're going to cheat and lie and be corrupt their entire way.
[01:15:16.133 --> 01:15:18.237]  That's the only thing they're interested in is absolute and our power.
[01:15:20.481 --> 01:15:30.668]  Ladies and gentlemen, people decided 500 years ago in Europe to stop the old system of tyranny and to create liberty for our children, and it produced incredible wealth and power.
[01:15:31.108 --> 01:15:32.309]  Now that's all being erased.
[01:15:32.829 --> 01:15:34.170]  Stand with Andrew Tate.
[01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:35.071]  Stand with Steve Bannon.
[01:15:35.391 --> 01:15:36.272]  Stand with InfoWars.
[01:15:36.332 --> 01:15:39.174]  And remember, I can't fight the war against these people without your support.
[01:15:39.674 --> 01:15:41.115]  If you don't support us, they're going to win.

[01:15:47.479 --> 01:15:50.161]  InfoWarsStore.com, amazing products.

[01:16:01.084 --> 01:16:03.885]  One more Andrew Tate clip straight ahead, and then a bunch of more news.
[01:16:03.905 --> 01:16:04.385]  Stay with us.
[01:16:05.106 --> 01:16:09.107]  World fertilizer supply has been cut by 40%.
[01:16:09.327 --> 01:16:13.548]  The UN predicts hundreds of millions to starve to death.
[01:16:14.609 --> 01:16:15.509]  That's where we are.
[01:16:15.569 --> 01:16:16.729]  That's what the lockdowns did.
[01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:18.870]  That's the real world we're living in.
[01:16:20.023 --> 01:16:25.404]  And if you think you're immune from the starvation and death the globalists are carrying out against the third world, think again.
[01:16:26.084 --> 01:16:26.924]  That's what we're fighting.
[01:16:27.785 --> 01:16:35.386]  And now we have this eugenicist depopulationist, new king of England, that is being put in charge.
[01:16:35.406 --> 01:16:36.807]  This is just an incredible moment.
[01:16:37.067 --> 01:16:40.167]  He's deeply embedded with the World Economic Forum and their programs.
[01:16:40.747 --> 01:16:42.568]  But as I said, I interviewed Andrew Tate yesterday.
[01:16:42.588 --> 01:16:46.709]  We're adding a bunch of clips and documentation and it's going to be huge on Monday.
[01:16:46.729 --> 01:16:48.409]  We're going to be airing it.
[01:16:49.013 --> 01:16:57.899]  But here is one more clip, a little prelude to what's coming up, where he talks about the systems afraid of real masculine men.
[01:16:58.359 --> 01:16:58.779]  Here it is.
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:16:59.720]  You said it.
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:00.841]  Aspire to something.
[01:17:01.261 --> 01:17:03.342]  Young people aren't aspiring to anything.
[01:17:03.383 --> 01:17:08.206]  The left teaches them to be lazy, to be victims, to be depressed, and that's cool.
[01:17:08.406 --> 01:17:08.646]  No.
[01:17:09.206 --> 01:17:24.531]   When you're fighting in a business or for your family or for your life or getting up to go to your friend's house when they need your help, And them helping you, that's the real brotherhood, the sisterhood, the human community of being a clan.
[01:17:25.012 --> 01:17:32.116]  And we're one human species that needs those goals, and so people need to aspire and say, I want to be successful.
[01:17:32.717 --> 01:17:38.000]  Because it's not even getting to the success that matters, it's aspiring to it, it's what you're supposed to do.
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:43.244]  Because you've got to have a purpose-driven life and a mission, and these young people need a mission, and you're giving them a mission.
[01:17:44.534 --> 01:18:04.507]  Absolutely, and what's actually interesting is it's extremely hypocritical because when the shit hits the fan, when they need soldiers to go die in a war, when they need firemen to charge into a burning building, when they need police officers to hopefully save children in a school shooting and not just stand outside, when they need real men to go do real things, then they call on the men like me and the men who think like me.
[01:18:04.887 --> 01:18:09.570]  Then they want the men who are brave, who are masculine, who have tenets of masculinity, who have honor, who have duty.
[01:18:09.610 --> 01:18:10.291]  Then they want us.
[01:18:10.631 --> 01:18:17.756]  But as soon as they don't want us to go risk our lives to protect them, they say we're not allowed opinion, we're not allowed to think, we're not allowed to talk, and we should be depersoned and deleted.
[01:18:18.056 --> 01:18:23.459]  They try and use us, absolutely and utterly, because society needs men like us, and I'm the one who's been speaking up for them.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.901]  They also pretend they give a shit about men's mental health.
[01:18:26.281 --> 01:18:28.203]  You told me one example about how I helped your friend.
[01:18:28.563 --> 01:18:34.767]  I have hundreds of thousands of emails for young men I've helped, and older men, who I've helped with their mindset and helped with their approach towards life.
[01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:39.187]   life. I have genuinely changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people for the better.
[01:18:39.187 --> 01:18:42.906]   They talk about giving a shit about men and giving a shit about men's mental health while
[01:18:42.906 --> 01:18:46.787]   deleting me, the person who helps them the most, and saying they're going to replace
[01:18:46.787 --> 01:18:52.707]   me with some algorithm matrix agent bot like Logan Paul who nobody respects and doesn't
[01:18:52.707 --> 01:18:56.067]   want to listen to. It's bullshit. If they gave a shit about men's mental health, they'd
[01:18:56.067 --> 01:18:59.306]  leave me up there to inspire the youth. They don't care.
[01:18:59.306 --> 01:19:01.947]   All they care about is narrative control.
[01:19:01.947 --> 01:19:05.547]  Are you going to get in a ring with Logan Paul?
[01:19:05.547 --> 01:19:09.306]   Let's hope for his sake it never happens because he doesn't want to get hurt that badly.
[01:19:09.256 --> 01:19:12.878]  I just find it very interesting what happened to me, and probably the same thing happened to you.
[01:19:13.618 --> 01:19:30.624]  During my banning, I saw in real time and learned which public figures, which talking heads, which are allowed to have a platform by the Matrix, actually have any kind of degree of character, and which ones will instantly bend, break, and swap and change their opinion on you overnight because somebody above them told them they have to.
[01:19:31.064 --> 01:19:37.730]  You get to learn in real time who actually sticks up for you, and it's true, and some people are, and which ones just instantly cave and comply.
[01:19:38.029 --> 01:19:40.908]   You'd be amazed how many people have absolutely no moral fiber.
[01:19:40.908 --> 01:19:43.708]  [SFX]
[01:19:43.708 --> 01:19:47.948]  Alright, so that interview drops Monday.
[01:19:47.948 --> 01:19:51.788]  That was about eight minutes of it and powerful?
[01:19:51.788 --> 01:19:54.429]  I don't say something's powerful unless it's powerful.
[01:19:54.645 --> 01:20:03.631]  That was powerful, and Dr. Andrew Wakefield is powerful, because he went through hell and was demonized and lied about by the corporate press, same way I've been.
[01:20:03.831 --> 01:20:05.872]  Total misrepresentations, but it came out a decade later.
[01:20:06.373 --> 01:20:09.415]  What he said was dead on in the research, and they falsified the reports on him.
[01:20:09.835 --> 01:20:21.242]   He is uniquely positioned, he's in that green room right there, he'll be here with us in about 10 minutes in the studio, to speak to They lied about the shot.
[01:20:21.262 --> 01:20:22.043]  It doesn't protect you.
[01:20:22.063 --> 01:20:24.984]  9 out of 10 dying have been triple jabbed.
[01:20:25.925 --> 01:20:27.265]  Incredible information.
[01:20:27.305 --> 01:20:29.406]  He'll be responding to that.
[01:20:29.507 --> 01:20:32.008]  And when you share this information, it's going to save lives.
[01:20:32.348 --> 01:20:36.310]  They have record low vaccine uptake now all over the Western world.
[01:20:36.370 --> 01:20:40.172]  Not just the poison mRNA gene therapy shots, but all the shots.
[01:20:40.832 --> 01:20:41.913]  I'm not against inoculation.
[01:20:42.053 --> 01:20:43.173]  I know there's real technology.
[01:20:43.473 --> 01:20:46.515]  You get a small part of something that's bad and then your body learns how to beat it.
[01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:48.776]  But what are they Trojan horsing in there?
[01:20:50.177 --> 01:20:51.678]  Why do they have liability protection?
[01:20:52.378 --> 01:20:54.019]  What are all these secret deals they've done?
[01:20:54.379 --> 01:20:57.960]  Why did they sequence the COVID-19 years before they released it?
[01:20:58.161 --> 01:21:00.802]  That's coming out in the European Union Parliament.
[01:21:00.822 --> 01:21:01.822]  We played that first hour.
[01:21:02.282 --> 01:21:03.763]  It's all coming up next hour.
[01:21:04.123 --> 01:21:07.064]  This is just as important as Andrew Tate or Steve Bannon.
[01:21:08.365 --> 01:21:17.669]  Families, masculinity, human drive, strength, free speech, nationalism, populism, capitalism, prosperity, and medical freedom.
[01:21:18.029 --> 01:21:19.330]  That's coming up next hour.
[01:21:21.459 --> 01:21:26.143]  But I'll tell listeners again, we're toe-to-toe with George Soros.
[01:21:26.203 --> 01:21:27.504]  We're toe-to-toe with the New World Order.
[01:21:28.204 --> 01:21:30.686]  And we can't continue to prosecute this fight without you.
[01:21:30.986 --> 01:21:34.449]  So I want to thank all the listeners that have supported us over the years and commend you.
[01:21:35.109 --> 01:21:46.298]  But I want to tell the listeners that tune in by the millions every day that have never gone to InfoWarsTour.com, never bought a great product, never got a t-shirt, never got a water filter, never got one of our great supplements, to just ask you, I mean, who's fighting for you?
[01:21:46.438 --> 01:21:47.339]  I just want to win this fight.
[01:21:48.337 --> 01:21:49.697]  and I can't do it without you.
[01:21:49.697 --> 01:21:55.357]   So I wanna encourage those that have been on the fence and never gone to infowarstore.com to go there today
[01:21:55.357 --> 01:21:57.997]  'cause we've got so many great products back in stock.
[01:21:57.997 --> 01:22:06.657]   Our Greens Fiber product is all of the key known like wheatgrass and alfalfa and cilantro concentrates
[01:22:06.657 --> 01:22:12.117]   for your body's immunity, for your intestines health, for your overall vitality.
[01:22:12.117 --> 01:22:14.157]  I mean, this is such a great product.
[01:22:14.157 --> 01:22:17.676]   Back in stock, it's been sold out for a year 'cause of supply chain breakdowns.
[01:22:17.676 --> 01:22:22.677]  40, no 50, excuse me, 50% off.
[01:22:22.919 --> 01:22:24.699]  What's 40% off is DietForce.
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:29.421]  I'm still a fat ass, but I lost 40-something pounds taking this in just the last few months.
[01:22:29.441 --> 01:22:30.061]  You've all seen it.
[01:22:30.722 --> 01:22:38.464]  It's all the known concentrated herbs and compounds that naturally help speed up your metabolism like you're a younger person to burn that fat.
[01:22:38.945 --> 01:22:41.366]  DietForce, back in stock, 40% off.
[01:22:41.726 --> 01:22:43.086]  Then, the Nootropics.
[01:22:43.166 --> 01:22:45.067]  Two different formulas, two different deals.
[01:22:45.874 --> 01:22:49.016]  We went out and created RainForce Plus five, six years ago.
[01:22:49.437 --> 01:22:53.720]  Well, the first RainForce came out and then the FDA ban on the ingredients.
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.481]  So when you change it, you got to change the labels.
[01:22:55.541 --> 01:22:58.363]  It's RainForce Plus, got a new ingredient that's just as good or maybe even better.
[01:22:58.883 --> 01:23:03.947]  And it's five to six hours of clean energy that doesn't give you a letdown, that's healthy and good for your body.
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:09.521]  InfoWarsTore.com, BrainForce Plus is 50% off.
[01:23:09.621 --> 01:23:12.382]  And then, BrainForce Ultra, nobody's got this formula.
[01:23:12.882 --> 01:23:18.063]  It kicks in really fast, lasts 2-3 hours, and you can sleep and feel great after it, no letdown.
[01:23:18.464 --> 01:23:19.524]  It's really something special.
[01:23:19.864 --> 01:23:27.026]  Everybody should enjoy and experience BrainForce Ultra, exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:23:27.046 --> 01:23:29.266]  Alright, let's hit some of these other news items.
[01:23:32.904 --> 01:23:35.689]  This is a big story from Zero Hedges on InfoWars.com.
[01:23:35.729 --> 01:23:36.330]  So frightening.
[01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:42.489]   Ukraine's top general doesn't rule out limited nuclear war to defeat the Russians.
[01:23:42.489 --> 01:23:44.890]  And NATO's pushing the same ideas.
[01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:50.090]   Mother details how a university official taught four-year-old pronouns gender identities.
[01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:53.330]   We have all these undercover videos of Project Veritas and others where they say, "Yeah,
[01:23:53.330 --> 01:23:54.729]  we're going to indoctrinate the kids.
[01:23:54.729 --> 01:23:56.529]  Doesn't matter what the parents want."
[01:23:56.529 --> 01:24:00.130]   Totally screwing up little children, teaching them they're another sex so they can mutilate
[01:24:00.130 --> 01:24:01.130]  them.
[01:24:01.130 --> 01:24:03.250]  Hundreds of secret NATO documents leaked.
[01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:07.451]   Portugal's General Staff of the Armed Forces has been targeted by a prolonged and unprecedented
[01:24:07.451 --> 01:24:12.010]   cyber attack resulting in the leak of a raft of secret NATO documents, local media reports.
[01:24:12.370 --> 01:24:13.891]  So a new WikiLeaks has happened.
[01:24:14.291 --> 01:24:16.273]  Gas pipeline explodes in Louisiana.
[01:24:17.093 --> 01:24:25.535]   The explosion of underwater pipeline triggered by fire in Lake Leary In Louisiana, on Thursday, the U.S.
[01:24:25.555 --> 01:24:27.858]  Coast Guard responded to a massive fire that broke out.
[01:24:28.419 --> 01:24:29.861]  Hundreds of plants being blown up.
[01:24:30.181 --> 01:24:32.544]  Hundreds of food processing centers being blown up.
[01:24:32.824 --> 01:24:35.668]  The list goes on and on and on.
[01:24:36.068 --> 01:24:40.033]  And then this final big subject I'll hit later after our next guest leaves us.
[01:24:40.734 --> 01:25:01.687]  There are massive attacks in Memphis, in Atlanta, in Chicago, in Los Angeles, New York against white people by racist, crazy black people brainwashed that whites are bad, driving around live streaming, shooting pregnant white women, you name it, and bragging that they deserve it because they're white.
[01:25:01.887 --> 01:25:04.749]  This is the corporate media trying to get a race war going.
[01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:09.372]  99% of black people do not support this and they're not our enemy.
[01:25:10.051 --> 01:25:11.452]  But they're trying to get us to kill each other.
[01:25:11.832 --> 01:25:18.355]  Just like when they wind up some crazy white supremacist to go into a black grocery store and kill a bunch of people in Buffalo.
[01:25:18.815 --> 01:25:23.478]  That, ladies and gentlemen, we later learned had federal fingerprints all over it.
[01:25:23.558 --> 01:25:25.159]  So let's not be stupid.
[01:25:25.579 --> 01:25:26.499]  We knew this was coming.
[01:25:26.899 --> 01:25:28.260]  It's terrible what's happened to the victims.
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:28.820]  It's horrible.
[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:29.941]  Biden won't respond to it.
[01:25:31.462 --> 01:25:34.023]  When a crazy guy goes and shoots kids, it's the top story for a month.
[01:25:34.423 --> 01:25:53.188]   But when a crazy brainwashed black person does it, they cover it up because They're trying to build this momentum with these George Soros DAs letting these killers out to do this again to just have everything break down and hoping white people get pissed and go out and randomly kill black people.
[01:25:53.906 --> 01:25:58.927]  A black woman at the grocery store, it's not her fault somebody in another state who's black and racist wouldn't kill white people.
[01:25:59.447 --> 01:26:01.347]  Or if a white person does bad things to black people.
[01:26:02.128 --> 01:26:03.408]  It's not other white people's fault.
[01:26:03.528 --> 01:26:05.308]  It's the person that did it.
[01:26:05.368 --> 01:26:06.889]  And I know our general audience knows that.
[01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:10.629]  But let's not take the bait 60 days out from the election.
[01:26:11.049 --> 01:26:12.710]  Is there a giant war against white people?
[01:26:13.090 --> 01:26:14.710]  Is there 20 to 1 black on white crime?
[01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:15.010]  Yes.
[01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:20.452]   It's a tiny minority of brainwashed black males doing it, and we need to Prosecute them.
[01:26:20.472 --> 01:26:21.252]  We need to stop them.
[01:26:21.292 --> 01:26:22.013]  They need to be punished.
[01:26:22.233 --> 01:26:24.054]  But we do not blame black people.
[01:26:24.795 --> 01:26:27.276]  We blame the corporate media that hyped it up and then covered it up.
[01:26:27.597 --> 01:26:28.797]  They're the real ones doing it.
[01:26:28.998 --> 01:26:29.738]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:30.399 --> 01:26:37.399]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:26:37.399 --> 01:26:47.399]  Info Wars has been banned.
[01:26:47.399 --> 01:26:49.979]  (upbeat music)
[01:26:49.205 --> 01:26:49.765]  Arrested.
[01:26:49.805 --> 01:26:54.467]  Attacked and threatened.
[01:26:55.887 --> 01:26:57.308]  Because we are effective.
[01:26:57.348 --> 01:27:00.689]  The Great Awakening is here.
[01:27:01.029 --> 01:27:02.689]  Go to band.video.
[01:27:02.729 --> 01:27:05.490]  Download the videos and share.
[01:27:07.431 --> 01:27:11.112]  Support the Information War at infowarstore.com.
[01:27:14.736 --> 01:27:16.539]  And never give up the fight.
[01:27:16.458 --> 01:27:26.458]  [MUSIC]
[01:27:26.458 --> 01:27:33.259]   This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the US.
[01:27:33.316 --> 01:27:41.583]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[01:27:42.043 --> 01:27:44.505]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[01:27:44.545 --> 01:27:46.026]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[01:27:46.347 --> 01:27:48.248]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[01:27:48.509 --> 01:27:50.610]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[01:27:50.871 --> 01:27:51.932]  This is all confirmed.
[01:27:51.952 --> 01:27:52.892]  This is not a drill.
[01:27:53.052 --> 01:27:56.976]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[01:27:57.296 --> 01:27:58.716]  They've officially become state-run.
[01:27:58.836 --> 01:27:59.296]  Apple 100%.
[01:27:59.436 --> 01:28:05.357]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[01:28:05.797 --> 01:28:10.538]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[01:28:10.878 --> 01:28:11.719]  This is happening.
[01:28:11.759 --> 01:28:19.680]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:25.661]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[01:28:26.121 --> 01:28:34.127]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion paradigm manipulation.
[01:28:34.948 --> 01:28:38.510]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[01:28:38.571 --> 01:28:42.013]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[01:28:42.313 --> 01:28:49.339]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[01:28:49.579 --> 01:28:52.181]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[01:28:52.581 --> 01:28:57.525]  Total Internet of Things integration global social score complete command and control system.
[01:28:57.805 --> 01:29:13.517]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traitors inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Chai Com slash Big Tech hanging combine emergency situation.
[01:29:13.817 --> 01:29:18.981]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[01:29:20.089 --> 01:29:28.815]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[01:29:28.835 --> 01:29:33.718]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[01:29:34.098 --> 01:29:37.220]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:39.001]  And so they make me a herder of children.
[01:29:39.181 --> 01:29:47.006]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[01:29:47.526 --> 01:29:54.253]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[01:29:54.354 --> 01:30:00.060]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum, and it's being used against you.
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:05.005]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[01:30:05.025 --> 01:30:07.107]  I have given you the transmission!
[01:30:07.248 --> 01:30:08.209]  Now break free!
[01:30:11.896 --> 01:30:21.144]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:30:21.184 --> 01:30:23.846]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:30:23.766 --> 01:30:27.926]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:30:27.926 --> 01:30:34.926]  [Music]
[01:30:34.926 --> 01:30:41.926]   The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[01:30:42.746 --> 01:30:55.455]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[01:30:57.296 --> 01:31:00.798]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum, through full space-time.
[01:31:01.118 --> 01:31:05.220]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[01:31:05.441 --> 01:31:07.562]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[01:31:10.236 --> 01:31:26.348]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling!
[01:31:26.548 --> 01:31:27.268]  InfoWars.
[01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:28.529]  Tomorrow's News.
[01:31:28.849 --> 01:31:29.250]  Today.
[01:31:30.330 --> 01:31:36.515]  Well, any time I feel sorry for myself when I'm being persecuted, when they're lying about me, I think about Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
[01:31:37.521 --> 01:31:46.366]  Not the first scientist or doctor to come out and connect vaccines to autism and other debilitating issues, but the most prominent.
[01:31:47.167 --> 01:31:50.969]  And for those who don't know the story, he could recap it, but they put out a big story.
[01:31:51.009 --> 01:31:52.049]  They said he was a liar.
[01:31:52.410 --> 01:31:54.030]  Turned out a decade later, he was vindicated.
[01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:56.532]  Those that made it up, you know, they were discredited.
[01:31:57.372 --> 01:32:05.618]  But I can't think of a better guest for this whole mRNA rollout and the fact that they now admit it doesn't work, mails people sick, 9 out of 10 dying.
[01:32:05.678 --> 01:32:10.802]  British Medical Journal are dying who've had COVID, actually been triple jabbed.
[01:32:11.343 --> 01:32:13.745]  I mean, this thing has blown up big time in their face.
[01:32:13.765 --> 01:32:16.707]  He's got a new film, Infertility, a Diabolical Agenda.
[01:32:17.007 --> 01:32:19.649]  We'll play the trailer coming up a little bit later in this hour.
[01:32:20.050 --> 01:32:25.477]   But when I think about a redemption arc, You did real research as a research scientist.
[01:32:25.677 --> 01:32:28.660]  You put the information out and you've been proven right.
[01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:35.087]  You've been vindicated and now here we are in the year 2022 and nobody's laughing at Dr. Wakefield now.
[01:32:35.407 --> 01:32:36.728]  We're crying actually.
[01:32:36.768 --> 01:32:38.510]  So good to have you here my friend.
[01:32:38.850 --> 01:32:41.193]  God bless you and I'm going to try to shut up because you know I talk a lot.
[01:32:41.673 --> 01:32:42.613]  Alex, it's great to be back on the show.
[01:32:42.633 --> 01:32:43.293]  Thank you very much.
[01:32:43.153 --> 01:32:46.353]   recap who you are. We have a big audience, new listeners every day. There's probably
[01:32:46.353 --> 01:32:50.832]   a million new listeners right now with Andrew Tate and Steve Bannon on today. We usually
[01:32:50.832 --> 01:32:54.472]   have 3 million viewers, probably about 5 million today. So wherever you want to start, this
[01:32:54.472 --> 01:32:55.472]  is important.
[01:32:55.472 --> 01:33:00.953]   Alex, it's great to be back on the show. Thank you very much. For those who don't know, I
[01:33:00.953 --> 01:33:04.092]  started as a, I graduated in medicine in 1981 in London, St.
[01:33:04.092 --> 01:33:04.592]  Louis.
[01:33:04.557 --> 01:33:18.523]  Mary's Hospital, part of six generations of my family who have trained as doctors there, and the fundamental teaching to me was to listen, to listen to the patient or the patient's parents, because the first thing they tell you will be the clue to what's wrong with them.
[01:33:18.583 --> 01:33:20.584]  And that has gone from medicine now.
[01:33:20.624 --> 01:33:26.027]  And in 1995, mothers started calling me and saying my child was absolutely normal.
[01:33:26.887 --> 01:33:30.669]  And then they had a triple vaccine, MMR, and they regressed into autism.
[01:33:31.190 --> 01:33:32.691]  I said, I know nothing about autism.
[01:33:32.731 --> 01:33:34.011]  I'm a gastroenterologist.
[01:33:34.031 --> 01:33:34.592]  How can I help?
[01:33:34.652 --> 01:33:39.635]  And they said, my child has terrible GI problems, diarrhea, wasting, failure to thrive.
[01:33:39.995 --> 01:33:40.615]  They're in pain.
[01:33:40.675 --> 01:33:41.496]  I know they're in pain.
[01:33:41.556 --> 01:33:42.877]  They've lost the ability to speak.
[01:33:43.177 --> 01:33:44.698]  But as their mother, I know they're in pain.
[01:33:45.658 --> 01:33:49.660]  And, um, every doctor I've spoken to has dismissed this and sent me away.
[01:33:50.241 --> 01:33:54.083]  And so we investigated this, and as is always the case in medicine, the parents were right.
[01:33:54.123 --> 01:33:56.504]  The children had intestinal inflammation.
[01:33:56.544 --> 01:34:01.367]  When we treated that, not only did it heal the intestinal inflammation, it made the autism better.
[01:34:01.407 --> 01:34:02.588]  And so we, um...
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:16.307]  We pursued the vaccine issue against a lot of pushback from my colleagues and the medical school and heavy investment from pharmaceutical companies and it turned out to be absolutely right.
[01:34:16.387 --> 01:34:32.977]  Right to the extent that when the CDC investigated it later, as we reported in the film Vaxxed, V-A-X-X-E-D, they found the data so compelling that linked MMR vaccine to autism they had to destroy the data and to produce a paper that said something completely different.
[01:34:33.692 --> 01:34:46.369]  One of their senior scientists came forward 14 years later and said, we have done a terrible thing, we have lied, and we have put millions of children at risk of serious permanent neurological injury, and nothing happened.
[01:34:46.389 --> 01:34:50.674]  And that was what made me so angry at the time, Alex, and I thought there is no accountability.
[01:34:51.315 --> 01:34:55.457]  And from that point forward, my films were about accountability.
[01:34:55.978 --> 01:34:59.239]  People have to be held accountable for the damage they've done.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:07.624]  I should have added, your films have been seen close to a billion times, and you're like the original OG when it comes to exposing this.
[01:35:08.364 --> 01:35:12.147]  Is it surreal to now see it be the number one issue and just the carnage?
[01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:19.251]  You know it's fascinating Alex, when I started this there were five of us around the world who were prepared to talk openly about vaccine safety issues.
[01:35:19.752 --> 01:35:27.933]  Now that number, because of COVID and because of the movies, is more than half the adult population of the world.
[01:35:28.314 --> 01:35:32.375]  That is where this has come from and so people... So you're a human perseverance telling the truth story.
[01:35:32.395 --> 01:35:42.417]  It's not about lionizing, I know you don't want that, but people that are down but telling the truth need to know, there's, as Martin Luther King said, the universe bends towards justice.
[01:35:43.959 --> 01:35:47.541]  It needs, we absolutely need that, and we need accountability, we need justice.
[01:35:47.581 --> 01:36:08.435]  A lot of kids have been harmed, and as you pointed out with this COVID shot, a lot more people are being harmed, but it has woken people up to the fact that this has been perpetrated by a pharmaceutical industry and a government consortium that is working together that is not in the interests of the American people, the people of the world, but is in the interests of profit over people.
[01:36:08.695 --> 01:36:19.002]  You've gone from a true voice in the wilderness, being demonized, attacked, destroyed, reborn, like the phoenix vindicated, but I'm sure you're not even happy with that because you, I know, you'd rather just stop this.
[01:36:19.943 --> 01:36:20.804]  Yeah, it's not about me.
[01:36:20.844 --> 01:36:24.145]  And what I realized halfway through this, Alex, is it's not about me.
[01:36:24.546 --> 01:36:28.848]  As though all the insults were directed against me, it was made to sound personal.
[01:36:29.609 --> 01:36:41.315]  It was actually about something far more important, and that is the survival of the human species, the children, the grandchildren, the future of this country, of the world, were at risk.
[01:36:41.535 --> 01:36:43.577]  And I had to do something about that.
[01:36:43.597 --> 01:36:44.017]  Well, that's right.
[01:36:44.057 --> 01:36:57.116]   This is the populationist attack, and I brought that up as you raised When you went through hell, when I'm under attack, when I realize I'm part of the human species and just say, they're attacking us all, then I have total peace.
[01:36:57.777 --> 01:37:00.142]  And at that moment, the enemy loses power over you.
[01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:07.132]  It is absolutely my job, not only to persevere and prevail, but to thrive in this arena.
[01:37:07.192 --> 01:37:15.014]  I need to act as a beacon, if anything, to other doctors, other scientists, that there is life after this.
[01:37:15.054 --> 01:37:16.574]  You come out, you do the right thing.
[01:37:16.614 --> 01:37:29.598]  You do the right thing by virtue of your training, by virtue of the ethics that bind your professional... And I want to get to what's currently happening, and I'm going to shut up next segment, but recap what happened to you, because this is important and a lot of folks don't know about this.
[01:37:29.878 --> 01:37:33.919]  Well, I offended the pharmaceutical industry, the CDC, the NIH, I offended everybody.
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:47.304]  I went against an agenda that threatened their bottom line and their policy, and I said, look, all I said is that further work needs to be done to establish whether there's a relationship between this vaccine and autism, and the heavens opened and came down on me.
[01:37:49.225 --> 01:37:52.227]  So, for many, many years, there was an attack.
[01:37:52.548 --> 01:37:55.670]  They put James Murdoch onto Rupert Murdoch's son.
[01:37:55.710 --> 01:38:01.074]  They put him onto the board of GlaxoSmithKline, the biggest manufacturer of MMR vaccine in Europe.
[01:38:01.454 --> 01:38:03.776]  His job was to come after me, and that's what he did.
[01:38:04.336 --> 01:38:08.880]  And so, using mainstream media, I was vilified.
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:10.061]  And it was very difficult.
[01:38:10.081 --> 01:38:11.862]  It was me on one side, them on the other side.
[01:38:12.462 --> 01:38:14.944]  And there were some tough times ahead.
[01:38:15.945 --> 01:38:38.805]  In the end, sadly, the sheer weight of numbers of damaged children, the inevitability of the association, the fact that the parents had come forward and simply told the truth about what happened to their children, and the CDC having to fake the data to get rid of that effect, I mean, all of these things culminated in a major shift, a seismic shift.
[01:38:38.865 --> 01:38:40.787]  And you were given chances to back down, but you didn't.
[01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:42.401]  No, absolutely not.
[01:38:42.441 --> 01:38:43.502]  This was far too important.
[01:38:43.522 --> 01:38:47.906]  As I say, Alex, it wasn't about me, it was about the future of the children of the world.
[01:38:47.966 --> 01:38:53.412]  But it was about you, they made it about you, thinking if they could break you, they would break us, but you didn't break.
[01:38:54.973 --> 01:38:55.514]  I didn't break.
[01:38:58.945 --> 01:39:18.002]  And so, um, it came to the next movie, the infertility movie that you mentioned, and that was, I was finishing up a movie in 1986, the Act, about how the pharmaceutical companies were given liability from, liability protection from death and damage caused by their vaccine, something that was really not known.
[01:39:18.622 --> 01:39:20.904]  To the public in the way that it should have been.
[01:39:21.384 --> 01:39:23.026]  That they had the perfect business model.
[01:39:23.046 --> 01:39:24.847]  That they had a mandatory market.
[01:39:24.887 --> 01:39:26.448]  Kids had to get vaccines to go to school.
[01:39:26.768 --> 01:39:28.810]  They had no liability, no downside.
[01:39:29.110 --> 01:39:31.112]  They weren't going to pay anything for Medico Legal.
[01:39:31.872 --> 01:39:34.534]  And so what we had is a situation of perfect business model.
[01:39:34.835 --> 01:39:35.995]  All they could do was make a profit.
[01:39:36.015 --> 01:39:37.136]  They made a massive profit.
[01:39:37.657 --> 01:39:41.560]  And that really, that profit made them so powerful that allowed them to do what they have done.
[01:39:42.808 --> 01:39:47.972]  With COVID, with COVID shots, and perpetrate this crime upon the human population.
[01:39:48.012 --> 01:39:54.958]  And so I stuck with it, and I then finished that film up.
[01:39:55.359 --> 01:39:57.040]  That was film number three.
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:04.486]  And then Bobby Kennedy's team presented me with this data that would have been shot in East Africa, in Kenya, about infertility vaccines.
[01:40:04.546 --> 01:40:07.749]   And that's something that I kind of Dismissed for a long time.
[01:40:07.769 --> 01:40:22.835]  Well, I was completely wrong to have done that, because when I looked at the data, there in the published literature has been papers talking about the design and the ultimate successful design of anti-fertility vaccines for use in the third world.
[01:40:22.915 --> 01:40:39.169]   Now what they did then And this was the allegation from the Catholic Church in Kenya, who is a major healthcare provider, so it was a significant challenge that you are using this vaccine to render women infertile without giving them any informed consent at all.
[01:40:39.469 --> 01:40:47.216]  Women of reproductive age 15 to 50 years of age were being... Now we're going to go to break, Dr. Wakefield, and I'm going to shut up, because this is your new film.
[01:40:47.617 --> 01:40:51.400]   We'll play the trailer at the bottom of the hour in about 15 minutes, but This is what it's all about.
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:53.561]  They have you in admitting they have infertility vaccines.
[01:40:53.881 --> 01:40:55.122]  They add this hormone to the shot.
[01:40:55.882 --> 01:40:56.303]  All of it.
[01:40:56.563 --> 01:40:57.924]  I mean, they're caught red-handed.
[01:40:58.364 --> 01:41:04.908]  And this is the precursor to everything we're facing now with the connections to these mRNA shots and reduced fertility.
[01:41:04.928 --> 01:41:06.228]  Dr. Andrew Wakefield is our guest.
[01:41:06.569 --> 01:41:08.710]  The new film, Infertility, A Diabolical Agenda.
[01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:10.371]  We'll tell you how to see the film coming up.
[01:41:11.091 --> 01:41:17.638]  So, one of the original fighters over the last 27 years, Dr. Andrew Wakefield is in the studio with us.
[01:41:17.678 --> 01:41:20.761]  The new film, Infertility, A Diabolical Agenda.
[01:41:22.156 --> 01:41:25.117]  People need to go there, they need to watch the film, they need to get it out to everybody they know.
[01:41:25.157 --> 01:41:27.217]  We'll play the trailer, come next segment.
[01:41:27.237 --> 01:41:34.699]  So we've talked about some of your past, what's currently happening, and this key area of infertility and sterilization vaccines.
[01:41:34.979 --> 01:41:38.159]  You go to the UN website, type in infertility sterilization vaccines.
[01:41:38.219 --> 01:41:40.220]  It's a 30-40 year program.
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:42.140]  So I'm gonna try to shut up now, doctors.
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:45.481]  You can lay this out and why this is the next big push in your research.
[01:41:46.422 --> 01:41:51.928]  The infertility vaccine program started in New Delhi in India, funded by the World Health Organization.
[01:41:52.799 --> 01:42:03.021]  And it started around the early 1970s, but by 1993 they'd been successfully developed an anti-fertility vaccine, and they then deployed that in developing countries.
[01:42:03.682 --> 01:42:07.943]  And they did so without any informed consent to the women involved.
[01:42:07.983 --> 01:42:09.483]  And it was much worse than that, Alex.
[01:42:09.923 --> 01:42:17.085]  They did so by claiming that these women were taking part in an anti-tetanus vaccine campaign.
[01:42:17.745 --> 01:42:23.128]  They're designed to protect the neonates, the newborn children in those countries.
[01:42:23.208 --> 01:42:27.690]  So not only were they not given informed consent, they were lied to about the purpose.
[01:42:27.710 --> 01:42:28.650]  That was the allegation.
[01:42:29.711 --> 01:42:36.634]  This story is really the uncovering, revealing of who was right, who was wrong, who lied, who told the truth.
[01:42:37.054 --> 01:42:53.759]  Because of course, as happens when the few doctors came out and said we are concerned that you are conducting an anti-fertility vaccine program under the guise of a tetanus program, then the heavens opened upon them and the Kenyan government, the World Health Organization came down on them.
[01:42:54.239 --> 01:42:57.380]  It finally came to a study, a test.
[01:42:57.540 --> 01:43:08.145]   We'll put our vaccines in, you put your vaccines in from the same campaign, we will get them analyzed in an accredited laboratory and we'll prove to you That there is no anti-fertility vaccine in there.
[01:43:08.765 --> 01:43:32.277]   And I don't want to spoil the end of the film, but it is an incredible tale of how a government and the World Health Organization were prepared to deceive the African people, the Kenyan people, the Kenyan mothers, the Kenyan mothers-to-be, not only to Stop them bearing children in the future, but to abort existing pregnancies, successful pregnancies.
[01:43:32.697 --> 01:43:33.977]  It's an extraordinary story.
[01:43:34.537 --> 01:43:35.418]  It's only half an hour.
[01:43:35.478 --> 01:43:39.259]  It's free to watch, so please go and watch it because there is... Now, where do they find it?
[01:43:39.339 --> 01:43:40.679]  On millions of listeners right now.
[01:43:41.559 --> 01:43:42.940]  Infertility, themovie.com.
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:43.340]  That's it.
[01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:45.040]  Infertility, themovie.com.
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:52.941]   And there is an extraordinary, one of the doctors in that, Dr. Karanja, at the end of the story he says, Watch out.
[01:43:53.542 --> 01:43:57.344]  He says, when they are finished with Africa, they are coming for you.
[01:43:58.064 --> 01:43:59.285]  Keep your children close.
[01:43:59.705 --> 01:44:02.126]  They will come for them, and they will come for you.
[01:44:02.286 --> 01:44:06.209]  And it was a prophetic warning to the rest of the world, and that's exactly what happened.
[01:44:06.249 --> 01:44:09.490]  Now, Dr. Karanja died under mysterious circumstances.
[01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:12.672]  Well, like five African presidents that wouldn't take the COVID thing died.
[01:44:12.832 --> 01:44:13.353]  Absolutely.
[01:44:13.393 --> 01:44:14.733]  And it was blamed on COVID.
[01:44:15.874 --> 01:44:19.216]  No, this man, according to his family, he was perfectly fit and healthy.
[01:44:19.236 --> 01:44:20.997]  The globalists have a real hard-on for Africans.
[01:44:22.677 --> 01:44:33.282]  And so, it is an extraordinary story, and one that really reminded me of just how deceitful and how dishonest these people really are.
[01:44:33.642 --> 01:44:35.383]  As if any of us needed reminding.
[01:44:36.284 --> 01:44:41.486]  And so finally, Alex, we come to the new movie, which we're in pre-production right here in Austin right now.
[01:44:41.506 --> 01:44:43.387]  Oh, it's good to have you back!
[01:44:43.507 --> 01:44:45.328]  You moved here, you moved to L.A.
[01:44:45.368 --> 01:44:46.669]  to produce films, now you're back.
[01:44:47.463 --> 01:44:56.511]  Yeah, I lived on a boat in Biscayne Bay in South Florida for a while as well, and now I'm back here in Austin making this new movie.
[01:44:56.571 --> 01:44:57.972]  So, exciting times.
[01:44:58.192 --> 01:44:58.813]  Great to have you, brother.
[01:44:58.833 --> 01:44:59.793]  Please continue with the new film.
[01:44:59.994 --> 01:45:00.494]  The new film?
[01:45:00.534 --> 01:45:01.775]  Well, it was co-written.
[01:45:02.075 --> 01:45:09.962]  The good thing about it, the bad thing about the pharmaceutical industry, but the good thing for screenwriters is that they give you an abundance of stuff to work with, material to work with.
[01:45:10.082 --> 01:45:14.386]  The lies, the fraud, the deception, the coercion, the bullying, the profit over people.
[01:45:15.006 --> 01:45:30.730]  And so, uh, this is a story that came to me some years ago, uh, it's a whistleblower story in the classic genre of whistleblower stories like Erin Brockovich, The Big Short, this kind of thing, and, and, uh, I sat down and I co-wrote it with Terry Rossio, and people say, oh, who's Terry Rossio?
[01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:38.433]   Terry Rossio wrote little-known films like Shrek, Pirates of the Caribbean, uh, Aladdin, Godzilla versus King Kong.
[01:45:38.573 --> 01:45:41.134]  So the good news is heavy hitters are deciding to join.
[01:45:41.154 --> 01:45:44.575]  Heavy hitters are joining in and that's changing the landscape completely.
[01:45:44.735 --> 01:45:46.596]  I can tell you off record that's happening with us too.
[01:45:46.996 --> 01:45:48.737]  So there's not just evil people in the world.
[01:45:49.037 --> 01:45:52.998]  In fact, historically evil always gets its run like Hitler and finally people wake up.
[01:45:53.338 --> 01:45:57.500]  I think we're seeing that right now that finally good goes, whoa, I gotta get up off the couch here.
[01:45:57.860 --> 01:46:02.782]  And the irony is that what has woken so many people up apart from film is COVID.
[01:46:03.442 --> 01:46:12.713]   Covid has brought to people's attention just how deceptive, just how dishonest, and just how So that's the good side of Hollywood, is you have top producers behind you now.
[01:46:13.093 --> 01:46:15.795]  We have great people on the team, and that's a wonderful thing.
[01:46:15.995 --> 01:46:24.782]  The film also offers, because of the way that Hollywood has treated actors, you have to get this vaccine, you cannot come on set, you can't do this, you're out of a job.
[01:46:25.282 --> 01:46:30.886]  We've offered a home for people who have taken a view that, no, health freedom is actually much more important.
[01:46:30.986 --> 01:46:41.113]   And again, it's not about a victory lap, but I was talking to Dr. McCullough and Dr. Mercola and all of them, I was talking to Joe Rugger this weekend, At dinner, and Joe's like, yeah, we won this fight.
[01:46:41.133 --> 01:46:41.873]  I go, no we haven't yet.
[01:46:42.493 --> 01:46:44.234]  You've got to do a victory lap to show you were right.
[01:46:44.254 --> 01:46:45.274]  He goes, OK, I guess I'll do it.
[01:46:45.314 --> 01:46:47.415]  But we need to say, hey, we were right.
[01:46:47.635 --> 01:46:48.856]  I mean, we were right.
[01:46:49.536 --> 01:46:49.816]  We were.
[01:46:49.876 --> 01:46:59.140]  The mainstream media likes to ignore the fact that all those conspiracy theorists who came forward years ago have turned out to be absolutely right about everything that's happened.
[01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:01.200]  You're a smart guy, Dr. Wakefield.
[01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:02.621]  How do you think the empire strikes back?
[01:47:04.449 --> 01:47:05.569]  How will it come?
[01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:19.795]  Well, I think, and I try and put myself in their position many times, you know, what's it like on K Street in those highly paid, you know, the offices of those extremely highly paid sort of publicists and front men for the pharmaceutical industry?
[01:47:19.835 --> 01:47:20.615]  It must be chaos.
[01:47:21.115 --> 01:47:22.875]  What have we got to do to get people to believe us?
[01:47:22.915 --> 01:47:27.376]  Because more and more and more people are walking away from this saying, I've changed my mind.
[01:47:27.876 --> 01:47:30.677]  You lied to us and we don't believe your vaccines are safe.
[01:47:31.097 --> 01:47:32.357]  My grandmother just died.
[01:47:32.417 --> 01:47:33.217]  My uncle died.
[01:47:33.297 --> 01:47:34.097]  My father died.
[01:47:34.737 --> 01:47:35.698]  My siblings have died.
[01:47:35.958 --> 01:47:36.598]  What's going on?
[01:47:36.658 --> 01:47:38.738]  Why are all these sportsmen dropping dead?
[01:47:39.198 --> 01:47:40.939]  Healthy people in the prime of life.
[01:47:41.079 --> 01:47:42.219]  What is going on?
[01:47:42.419 --> 01:47:44.379]  And they're trying to contain that message.
[01:47:44.559 --> 01:47:45.219]  It's getting out.
[01:47:45.439 --> 01:47:46.860]  It's getting out to the world.
[01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:48.000]  Thanks to people like you, Alex.
[01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:57.987]  People are waking up in droves to the reality of what we're facing and hopefully in time to do something effective about it.
[01:48:00.009 --> 01:48:01.510]  They admit they're planning new lockdowns.
[01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:02.811]  They admit they're planning new viruses.
[01:48:04.452 --> 01:48:07.935]  Yeah, I think they've got major problems because people don't believe them anymore.
[01:48:08.295 --> 01:48:14.000]  And so when they come along and say, monkeypox, or we got a new strain of this, new strain of that, and we're going to give you more of that, people are saying no.
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:19.766]   Actually, we're turning our backs on this because even though we got the first shot, Well, we got the second shot.
[01:48:19.806 --> 01:48:20.786]  We're not going to get the booster.
[01:48:20.846 --> 01:48:23.748]  Lowest level of vaccination, not just for COVID.
[01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:25.089]  Everybody's refusing it.
[01:48:25.129 --> 01:48:25.990]  Lowest level in history.
[01:48:26.290 --> 01:48:36.457]  Well, I think what's happening is this is going across the bridge from the adult vaccine program with COVID, and people are saying, wow, this has been happening in the pediatric, the childhood vaccine program for decades.
[01:48:36.977 --> 01:48:39.979]  So why did they jump the shark and try this untested thing?
[01:48:40.039 --> 01:48:47.028]   I mean, why they were already in trouble, as the UN said two and a half years ago in that meeting, I think Tony Fauci has a lot to do with this.
[01:48:46.847 --> 01:48:50.368]   against us, our own doctors think these vaccines are hurting people, you've seen the videos,
[01:48:50.368 --> 01:49:00.927]  why would they think, well let's just double down?
[01:49:01.062 --> 01:49:05.505]  You are totally dependent on those people who give you expert or so-called expert advice.
[01:49:05.565 --> 01:49:07.727]  You're not an epidemiologist, you're not a virologist.
[01:49:08.107 --> 01:49:17.354]  So if someone says to you, we've got this pandemic that's sweeping the world, people are going to die, we need to move very, very quickly to produce a vaccine, you are, you're terrified because you don't know.
[01:49:17.374 --> 01:49:18.855]  Okay, well, let's do it.
[01:49:18.955 --> 01:49:22.538]  Let's do it because this is the advice I'm getting from my top medical advisor.
[01:49:22.578 --> 01:49:27.121]  What you've got to understand is that Tony Fauci had a vaccine and vaccine only agenda.
[01:49:28.372 --> 01:49:36.519]  The diseases for which he is responsible in this country for solving all the autoimmune diseases, the allergic diseases, have gone up dramatically.
[01:49:36.579 --> 01:49:39.021]  If he was a CEO... That's right, stay right there, Dr. Wakefield.
[01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:45.566]  So, Dr. Wakefield, you already moved past your new film, Infertility, A Diabolical Agenda.
[01:49:45.927 --> 01:49:47.729]  I want to get into the future stuff you're talking about.
[01:49:47.749 --> 01:49:50.171]  The number's coming out now, but I want to play this trailer.
[01:49:50.191 --> 01:49:51.513]  Tell us again about this film.
[01:49:51.993 --> 01:49:53.355]  Millions of people are watching right now.
[01:49:53.415 --> 01:49:54.656]  They just go get the free film.
[01:49:55.077 --> 01:49:57.099]  If they just share it, we can save a lot of lives here.
[01:49:57.139 --> 01:50:00.443]  This is an admitted, caught red-handed UN depopulation program.
[01:50:01.061 --> 01:50:02.622]  Yep, get it out, Far and Wide.
[01:50:02.823 --> 01:50:16.694]  Everybody you know, it's an extraordinary film, it's 30 minutes, it's easy watching, it's... It really is a remarkable story, and, uh... I was, uh, very proud to be part of it, so please take a look at it, and, uh, it really changed my mind.
[01:50:17.875 --> 01:50:21.396]  Uh, on this whole issue of, is there a depopulation agenda?
[01:50:21.916 --> 01:50:23.556]  And the answer is categorically yes.
[01:50:23.616 --> 01:50:25.817]  And of course, it's got far worse.
[01:50:25.957 --> 01:50:34.419]  When Tony Fauci goes out there and says of the COVID shots, there is absolutely no evidence, none whatsoever, that this can affect fertility.
[01:50:34.939 --> 01:50:38.800]  What he doesn't tell you is that that is based upon the fact that there's been no science behind it.
[01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:56.332]  When that science is done, for example the study in Israel of sperm counts in sperm donors before and after the vaccine, a very good study, following the same individuals over time, it shows a significant fall in sperm count and motility.
[01:50:56.792 --> 01:50:58.133]  That is really worrying.
[01:50:58.293 --> 01:50:58.573]  Why?
[01:50:58.894 --> 01:51:06.339]  Because it comes against the background of a massively, rapidly declining sperm count in men over the last 100 years anyway.
[01:51:06.719 --> 01:51:10.421]   So as a threat To an existential threat to mankind.
[01:51:10.501 --> 01:51:11.061]  It's huge.
[01:51:12.141 --> 01:51:12.682]  Incredible.
[01:51:12.722 --> 01:51:15.503]  Let's go ahead and play the trailer for Infertility, a Diabolical Agenda.
[01:51:15.323 --> 01:51:37.521]  And here it is.
[01:51:37.881 --> 01:51:38.881]  To achieve their ends?
[01:51:40.362 --> 01:51:59.547]  To imagine that a system somewhere, some people somewhere, are behind my inability to carry pregnancy to term, that is a diabolical agenda.
[01:52:00.827 --> 01:52:15.700]   And woe to them, because as long as I'm here alive in this world, If they bring any vaccines here, I will hunt it down, analyze it, and tell the Kenyan people what it is.
[01:52:19.561 --> 01:52:32.464]  In a story that is reminiscent of Jean Le Carre's The Constant Gardener, on April 29th, 2021, Dr. Karanja was killed, officially, by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
[01:52:35.339 --> 01:52:39.380]  The late Dr. Karanja had a message for the rest of the world.
[01:52:41.081 --> 01:52:44.462]  When they are through with Africa, they're coming for you.
[01:52:46.323 --> 01:52:47.563]  Keep your children ready.
[01:52:47.884 --> 01:52:50.865]  They will come for them, and they'll come for you.
[01:52:53.486 --> 01:52:59.848]  And right now in Europe and the United States, they're funding black supremacists to mow down, do mass shootings of white people every day.
[01:53:01.252 --> 01:53:03.093]  This is part of a larger plan.
[01:53:03.193 --> 01:53:04.574]  Shame on those people that have done this.
[01:53:04.914 --> 01:53:08.175]  We're all one human community and we're standing against this right now.
[01:53:08.235 --> 01:53:09.796]  We can see what they're doing, Dr. Wakefield.
[01:53:10.276 --> 01:53:10.616]  We can.
[01:53:10.676 --> 01:53:15.459]  And I want to reassure people, Alex, this is very, very important, is that people think we're losing.
[01:53:15.519 --> 01:53:15.979]  We're losing.
[01:53:16.019 --> 01:53:16.679]  This is terrible.
[01:53:16.699 --> 01:53:17.820]  We're in a terrible situation.
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:19.902]  What you have to understand is the history.
[01:53:19.922 --> 01:53:27.810]  When I first got involved in this, as I say, five to ten people, a handful of people around the world were prepared to discuss the issue of vaccine safety.
[01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:31.554]  Now it's the majority of the adult population of the world.
[01:53:32.315 --> 01:53:51.770]  There is a massive movement towards health freedom, towards concerns over vaccines and vaccine safety as well as other pharmaceuticals as to the nefarious practices of the pharmaceutical companies of their close ties with government officials and the agencies like the FDA that are there supposedly to regulate them.
[01:53:52.851 --> 01:53:54.432]  We are prevailing.
[01:53:54.472 --> 01:53:55.293]  We are winning.
[01:53:55.313 --> 01:54:01.516]  People need to take that message away and push harder, push harder, because it's really going to turn around very quickly.
[01:54:01.536 --> 01:54:04.878]  I know you only follow science, but what is this lust of the globalists?
[01:54:04.898 --> 01:54:12.283]  Well, they pose as liberals and try to put blacks in positions of liberal leadership to sell the agenda like Black Lives Matter, but they really hate black people.
[01:54:12.783 --> 01:54:13.743]  Do we know why that is?
[01:54:15.441 --> 01:54:15.842]  I don't know.
[01:54:17.083 --> 01:54:19.586]  It's a question I've wanted to ask them all along.
[01:54:19.646 --> 01:54:23.091]  And people say, for example, with the vaccine issue, how could they do this?
[01:54:23.712 --> 01:54:24.352]  Surely they couldn't.
[01:54:24.412 --> 01:54:28.938]  Surely the CDC wouldn't fake data that would put children at risk of serious injury.
[01:54:30.098 --> 01:54:31.379]  And why do they do it?
[01:54:31.559 --> 01:54:32.960]  And that's not a question for me.
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:35.061]  The question is for them, and I'd love to pose it to them.
[01:54:35.481 --> 01:54:36.202]  Why did you do it?
[01:54:36.282 --> 01:54:37.222]  What led you to do this?
[01:54:37.262 --> 01:54:40.464]  You know, throughout history, we've said, how could people do this?
[01:54:40.884 --> 01:55:00.493]   How could they not behave in the way that... And that's a question I'd love to put to them, because I do not understand how anyone would... And again, the average black American's voting Republican, voting Patriot, doesn't mean Trump's perfect, but they're waking up But then you have the left saying, we love black people, but all they do is try to destroy them and then get them to do bad things, so we hate them.
[01:55:01.513 --> 01:55:05.856]  Yes, and to divide a population, divided in so many ways.
[01:55:05.956 --> 01:55:07.678]  And people talk about unity.
[01:55:07.718 --> 01:55:08.458]  There is a disparity.
[01:55:09.019 --> 01:55:11.861]  One of the strengths of this country is the diversity of the country.
[01:55:12.341 --> 01:55:24.575]   There is this hybrid vigor in America that has come from all of these people coming from around the world to create an extraordinary... For folks who don't know that, in any animal, a hybrid is stronger than Like an inbred Queen of England.
[01:55:24.635 --> 01:55:24.935]  That's right.
[01:55:24.955 --> 01:55:33.281]  This concept of hybrid vigour is intermixing to the point where the best genes get selected and you have, you know, the strongest, healthiest people.
[01:55:35.103 --> 01:55:39.623]   And so we have this hybrid vigor in America because, precisely because, people have come
[01:55:39.623 --> 01:55:45.743]   in from all over the world and have made their homes here and have created this hybrid vigor,
[01:55:45.743 --> 01:55:46.743]  this extraordinary...
[01:55:46.743 --> 01:55:47.903]  There's an attack on that American dream.
[01:55:47.903 --> 01:55:48.903]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:55:48.903 --> 01:55:50.622]  Which they pose as they're claiming they're...
[01:55:50.622 --> 01:55:51.622]  No, they're creating division.
[01:55:51.622 --> 01:55:53.182]  They're not creating unity.
[01:55:53.182 --> 01:55:54.743]  No, they're creating division.
[01:55:54.743 --> 01:55:56.182]  And you see it all the time.
[01:55:56.182 --> 01:56:00.382]   I mean, just Joe Biden's speech the other day, it was so manifestly obvious that it
[01:56:00.382 --> 01:56:01.382]  was...
[01:56:01.382 --> 01:56:04.743]   Troops, red background, declaring war on his political enemies, saying they're violent.
[01:56:04.743 --> 01:56:08.262]  He did it again last night.
[01:56:08.033 --> 01:56:16.921]  I come into this country as an immigrant, someone who came in sort of political and professional exile from the UK, and I've thrived and I love this country.
[01:56:16.981 --> 01:56:17.882]  It's a great country.
[01:56:18.283 --> 01:56:28.162]   And to hear Biden talking about Trump supporters as though they are Well he says they're Hitler while he's on a Hitler background.
[01:56:28.482 --> 01:56:30.244]  Nighttime rally, red light, that's Hitler.
[01:56:30.965 --> 01:56:39.656]  You and I have been around the country talking at meetings with General Mike Flynn and others and there are people there, that church, that auditorium is packed.
[01:56:40.376 --> 01:56:42.097]  With patriotic Americans.
[01:56:42.397 --> 01:56:44.518]  And they're every color, and that's what scares them.
[01:56:44.878 --> 01:56:46.078]  There's not hate amongst them.
[01:56:46.318 --> 01:56:49.039]  They're black, they're white, there are all kinds of people there.
[01:56:49.419 --> 01:56:55.682]  And they've come because they share a vision of what this country is and what it should seek to continue to be.
[01:56:55.982 --> 01:56:58.262]  I think we're winning, though there's a lot of casualties.
[01:56:58.302 --> 01:56:59.283]  Do you disagree with that?
[01:56:59.303 --> 01:57:04.305]  A, and then B, again I said this earlier, but how does the enemy strike back?
[01:57:04.345 --> 01:57:06.045]  I keep saying that because they're not going to give up.
[01:57:06.285 --> 01:57:08.046]  They're losing right now, but they're not going to give up.
[01:57:08.908 --> 01:57:19.314]  Yes, we've seen them attack us in the media, we've seen them take us off social media, we've seen them really push their agenda as hard as they possibly can.
[01:57:19.474 --> 01:57:21.175]  I wonder where they will come next.
[01:57:21.315 --> 01:57:27.578]  I mean, can they, and this is one of the reasons I make film now, is that film is a way of getting message, a crucial message.
[01:57:27.638 --> 01:57:28.179]  It's the most powerful.
[01:57:28.299 --> 01:57:29.439]  Yeah, the most powerful way.
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:33.382]  And it, because people, American people in particular, understand film.
[01:57:34.278 --> 01:57:37.561]  And you entertain them and you educate them second, but you entertain them first.
[01:57:37.961 --> 01:57:43.647]  They get them sitting there, sitting forward in their seats, wanting to watch more, wanting to know more, and you've got an audience.
[01:57:43.667 --> 01:57:48.331]  So as long as you're honest with them and you tell them the truth, then you're going to change minds.
[01:57:49.352 --> 01:57:57.499]  Well, that's why your story, I don't want to talk about yourself, but your story of being telling the truth, demonized, destroyed, rebuilt, is really the redemption story.
[01:57:58.561 --> 01:58:06.025]  Because I remember telling you, Alex, years ago that time that it really changed for me when I was down in West Texas in Bandera and it was dead of night.
[01:58:06.065 --> 01:58:06.445]  The stars.
[01:58:06.705 --> 01:58:07.146]  Absolutely.
[01:58:07.166 --> 01:58:12.869]  I looked up at the sky and there was just millions and billions and billions of stars and I suddenly thought, you know what?
[01:58:13.489 --> 01:58:14.590]  This isn't about me at all.
[01:58:15.050 --> 01:58:18.072]  The universe really doesn't care terribly much what happens to Andy Wakefield.
[01:58:18.232 --> 01:58:20.213]  It's about something much, much more important.
[01:58:20.293 --> 01:58:40.408]   And that moment really changed everything for me because when I realized That it wasn't about me, it wasn't personal, it was about something much more important, then it was a huge weight off my shoulders, a huge burden off my shoulders, and I could continue, didn't matter what they said about me, I could continue doing the work with a good heart, with a free sort of conscience.
[01:58:40.808 --> 01:58:41.309]  Beautiful.
[01:58:41.429 --> 01:58:46.293]  Dr. Andrew Wakefield, final segment straight ahead, his new film and where we go from here, straight ahead.
[01:58:46.373 --> 01:58:47.954]  Infertility, a diabolical agenda?
[01:58:48.675 --> 01:58:52.598]  Final segment with Dr. Andrew Wakefield, totally vindicated.
[01:58:52.938 --> 01:58:55.219]  The new film, Infertility, a Diabolical Agenda.
[01:58:55.479 --> 01:58:59.902]  But you've got not just this film's website, we'll put on screen, but your own website.
[01:59:00.302 --> 01:59:04.725]  Such critical information, how do people find it?
[01:59:04.805 --> 01:59:06.947]  19861986theact.com.
[01:59:07.707 --> 01:59:08.688]  1986theact.com.
[01:59:08.728 --> 01:59:11.169]  And you can go there and you can watch all of our movies.
[01:59:11.289 --> 01:59:12.850]  Stream them, download them.
[01:59:14.525 --> 01:59:15.125]  Yeah.
[01:59:15.385 --> 01:59:17.046]  And people are really receptive and ready for this.
[01:59:17.407 --> 01:59:17.847]  Absolutely.
[01:59:17.867 --> 01:59:18.927]  People are loving these films.
[01:59:18.947 --> 01:59:20.508]  It's like the springtime's the time to plant.
[01:59:20.548 --> 01:59:22.509]  The human mind is ready for liberation.
[01:59:22.529 --> 01:59:23.890]  So I'm going to try to shut up the last 10 minutes.
[01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:25.631]  You've got the floor to cover whatever you want.
[01:59:25.971 --> 01:59:29.513]  But you asked me a question, Alex, about what will they do next?
[01:59:29.653 --> 01:59:32.234]  How will the empire strike back?
[01:59:32.274 --> 01:59:39.601]   And I didn't have an immediate answer, but I think you highlighted one of those ways, and that is Through the use of pandemics.
[01:59:39.681 --> 01:59:41.665]  Through the use... People are terrified of infection.
[01:59:41.705 --> 01:59:42.626]  They don't understand it.
[01:59:42.987 --> 01:59:44.470]  They don't understand what was coming.
[01:59:45.071 --> 01:59:48.217]  And they're easily manipulated in those circumstances.
[01:59:48.317 --> 01:59:49.559]  Particularly people who have...
[01:59:50.618 --> 01:59:59.745]  Trusted the man in the white coat for a very long time elderly people were gonna do what we're told because that's what the doctor tells us to do and It's that's a terrifying situation.
[01:59:59.785 --> 02:00:01.046]  So what will happen next?
[02:00:01.447 --> 02:00:12.958]   Well, you've you've highlighted the possibility that they're going to use another infectious agent another pandemic to instill fear into the global population again, and I think that is Maybe the way that they'll go about it.
[02:00:13.458 --> 02:00:14.278]  I think it will fail.
[02:00:14.298 --> 02:00:17.760]  I think it will fail just as monkeypox vaccines are failing.
[02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:23.922]  Just as that narrative is going down the tubes because people don't believe them anymore.
[02:00:24.022 --> 02:00:27.504]  People do not trust them and part of their initiative... Oh, one death in the US!
[02:00:28.044 --> 02:00:28.945]  Oh yeah.
[02:00:29.045 --> 02:00:29.665]  It's ridiculous.
[02:00:29.725 --> 02:00:37.049]  And their initiative now is to understand the mindset of those who are vaccine-resistant, those who are reluctant.
[02:00:37.169 --> 02:00:40.251]  And they spend millions of dollars trying to analyze them.
[02:00:40.271 --> 02:00:42.132]  So this last attack is like a beta test?
[02:00:42.472 --> 02:00:46.114]  They never come to us and say, why are you concerned about vaccine safety?
[02:00:46.154 --> 02:00:47.855]  And I could deliver them the facts.
[02:00:47.975 --> 02:00:48.715]  That never happens.
[02:00:48.755 --> 02:00:49.456]  It never happens.
[02:00:49.796 --> 02:00:56.379]   They assume that we're just Uneducated anti-vaxxers who, no, I spent 30 years studying.
[02:00:56.439 --> 02:00:58.560]  If something protected me, I'd take it every day.
[02:00:58.580 --> 02:00:59.340]  Absolutely.
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:02.522]  If it was safe and if it was effective, you would take it every day.
[02:01:02.562 --> 02:01:11.706]  And I think that the new movie that we're making now really hammers home on this safe and effective narrative in the biggest way.
[02:01:12.727 --> 02:01:13.747]  It's going to be very exciting.
[02:01:14.087 --> 02:01:19.888]   It's going to cause No doubt, a great deal of trouble in certain quarters, but it's the truth.
[02:01:20.488 --> 02:01:22.090]  And our job is to get the truth out there.
[02:01:24.231 --> 02:01:32.577]  How, if the whole thing's blow up in their face, and all these lawsuits are starting, and we know there's secret agreements, and 9 out of 10 dying and triple jab, how do they get out of this?
[02:01:32.617 --> 02:01:34.599]  Like, why would they do something so crazy?
[02:01:34.819 --> 02:01:35.419]  I don't think they do.
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:41.203]   I think that, when you look at it, what you've got are executives within the companies, They don't care.
[02:01:41.364 --> 02:01:42.064]  They've made their money.
[02:01:42.104 --> 02:01:45.386]  I think there have been five billionaires who've come out of Moderna already.
[02:01:45.406 --> 02:01:47.027]  I mean, I think Pfizer's made a hundred billion.
[02:01:47.167 --> 02:01:47.987]  Yeah, and they move on.
[02:01:48.348 --> 02:01:54.291]  Although they're interested in their stock price, they're satisfying their stockholders, making their bonuses and moving on.
[02:01:54.371 --> 02:01:57.633]  So they don't care what the long term for these vaccines is.
[02:01:58.033 --> 02:01:58.934]  That's not their issue.
[02:01:58.974 --> 02:02:01.095]  They're not liable for safety issues.
[02:02:01.135 --> 02:02:01.996]  And so they move on.
[02:02:02.036 --> 02:02:03.216]  They'll move on to the next one.
[02:02:03.937 --> 02:02:09.772]   And It really is left for the people to pick up the pieces, the people who've been jabbed.
[02:02:09.792 --> 02:02:15.896]  But why not put out sugar water and still make your hundred billion, instead kill a bunch of people and make enemies?
[02:02:16.316 --> 02:02:18.798]  Yes, I don't understand why they've gone about it in this way.
[02:02:19.298 --> 02:02:22.720]  I think it will turn out to be the biggest mistake they've ever made.
[02:02:23.161 --> 02:02:31.846]  And again, you pointed out earlier that people like Dr. Peter McCullough, one of the most published physicians in North America, changing sides, coming over and saying, no, this is wrong.
[02:02:33.067 --> 02:02:39.810]  A lot of major, major scientists, physicians, healthcare staff coming over to our side and saying this is wrong.
[02:02:39.850 --> 02:02:45.914]  And what those people will come to realize in time is that it didn't start with this shot, the COVID shot.
[02:02:46.014 --> 02:02:50.416]  It started a long time ago with the pediatric vaccine schedule and that.
[02:02:50.936 --> 02:02:54.037]  Is the message that we will be bringing to people in the next move?
[02:02:54.057 --> 02:02:59.640]  Well, that was the numbers I saw is that record low uptake in modern history of the shots.
[02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:07.003]  They've just like remember three years ago in December of 2019.
[02:03:07.443 --> 02:03:11.104]  They had that big UN meeting on vaccine efficacy in Switzerland.
[02:03:11.404 --> 02:03:12.225]  We played the clips here.
[02:03:12.245 --> 02:03:13.985]  They said our doctors don't believe it.
[02:03:14.046 --> 02:03:14.686]  It's killing people.
[02:03:14.746 --> 02:03:15.426]  It's not working.
[02:03:15.966 --> 02:03:17.047]  Everybody's against us.
[02:03:17.387 --> 02:03:18.968]  So they double down and do it again now.
[02:03:20.388 --> 02:03:23.550]  They have completely destroyed any credibility of any vaccines.
[02:03:24.231 --> 02:03:24.591]  They have.
[02:03:24.751 --> 02:03:26.452]  And they've only got themselves to blame.
[02:03:26.472 --> 02:03:29.314]  You see, what they do is they label people as anti-vaccine.
[02:03:29.374 --> 02:03:30.235]  I'm not anti-vaccine.
[02:03:30.255 --> 02:03:31.516]  What I am is pro.
[02:03:31.856 --> 02:03:33.037]  I'm pro good science.
[02:03:33.157 --> 02:03:34.538]  I'm pro informed consent.
[02:03:34.978 --> 02:03:36.519]  I'm pro doing the job right.
[02:03:36.579 --> 02:03:42.063]  I'm pro parents being able to make the right decisions, the right healthcare choices for themselves and their children.
[02:03:42.403 --> 02:03:43.163]  That's what I'm about.
[02:03:43.263 --> 02:03:43.724]  I'm pro.
[02:03:44.264 --> 02:03:56.712]  This label of anti-vaxxers is really just something that is conveniently put out there in the media, like conspiracy theorists, that just puts you in a bracket and we don't need to take any notice of them because they're anti-vaxxers.
[02:03:56.792 --> 02:03:57.013]  No!
[02:03:57.432 --> 02:04:02.231]   We've been pushing for good science throughout and that is what we will continue to do.
[02:04:02.231 --> 02:04:06.153]   So what comes next? Because again, if they had an anti-flu shot that didn't have a bunch of
[02:04:06.153 --> 02:04:11.112]   side effects or they were honest about it, little side effect, had studies and I don't want the flu,
[02:04:11.112 --> 02:04:16.393]   I'll take it. If they had something that worked, I'm all for it. I put out a bad product and then
[02:04:16.393 --> 02:04:22.952]   try to cover it up. I think fundamentally the whole principle of giving someone a vaccine,
[02:04:22.952 --> 02:04:27.993]   let's say a respiratory virus like measles, that we caught through the oral route that we breathed in,
[02:04:27.993 --> 02:04:28.993]  in.
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:40.488]  Is now being injected into the skin changed the biology of that virus completely in terms of the way the body saw it the way the body handled it and It was assumed and this is the problem.
[02:04:40.528 --> 02:04:41.829]  It was assumed that it would be okay.
[02:04:42.129 --> 02:05:00.841]   There is another assumption I would just want to talk about Alex I hope we got time and that is comes back to this infertility issue Is that a doctor got up a Canadian scientist who was a vaccinologist and he said we've made a huge mistake when we Developed this vaccine, we assumed that when we injected it, it would remain at the site of injection.
[02:05:01.921 --> 02:05:05.923]  We assumed, based upon our knowledge of childhood vaccines doing the same.
[02:05:06.204 --> 02:05:06.664]  No, they don't.
[02:05:06.704 --> 02:05:07.764]  No one's ever done those studies.
[02:05:08.165 --> 02:05:14.348]  That was the first misconception, is that no one's ever looked at the childhood vaccine to see if they stay at the site of injection.
[02:05:14.408 --> 02:05:15.529]  No, they go out throughout the body.
[02:05:16.029 --> 02:05:18.190]  He said the big mistake we made is we made that assumption.
[02:05:18.230 --> 02:05:24.273]  But they made that assumption on behalf of 7 billion people, the world's population, who they intended to vaccinate.
[02:05:24.553 --> 02:05:33.559]   They then find After giving the vaccine, that it doesn't remain at the site of injection, it goes throughout the body and it binds specifically to certain things like the ovaries.
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:39.504]  And where it will produce inflammation and autoimmune attack, and it will render some women infertile.
[02:05:39.544 --> 02:05:40.284]  The same with men.
[02:05:41.125 --> 02:05:41.665]  The testes.
[02:05:42.105 --> 02:05:42.386]  And so...
[02:05:43.519 --> 02:05:49.821]  You cannot make assumptions on behalf of the entire world population that it's going to behave in the way you want it to behave, because it won't.
[02:05:49.921 --> 02:05:57.164]  Well, I mean, I take a clip I played last week of the head of Pfizer saying, I didn't believe in mRNA, but my scientists came and said they thought it would work, so I did it.
[02:05:57.804 --> 02:05:58.584]  It's like gambling.
[02:05:59.885 --> 02:06:00.525]  It's an experiment.
[02:06:00.565 --> 02:06:01.545]  It's never been done before.
[02:06:02.165 --> 02:06:06.547]  It's a huge failure, and it's throwing up all kinds of complications.
[02:06:06.587 --> 02:06:11.949]  And the irony of all of this is people are getting sick, and of course, they need pharmaceutical products.
[02:06:13.007 --> 02:06:13.928]  To treat their symptoms.
[02:06:14.028 --> 02:06:15.149]  It's obviously premeditated.
[02:06:15.249 --> 02:06:16.970]  We're making money at the front end and the back end.
[02:06:17.010 --> 02:06:18.772]  Yeah, it's obviously premeditated.
[02:06:18.792 --> 02:06:19.793]  So let me ask you this in closing.
[02:06:20.453 --> 02:06:24.617]  How does it, you don't want to speculate, but gut level, how does it end for them?
[02:06:24.637 --> 02:06:25.598]  I think they've jumped the shark.
[02:06:25.618 --> 02:06:27.019]  I think they've gone too far.
[02:06:27.399 --> 02:06:30.722]  How do you see it currently ending for what Big Pharma's done?
[02:06:31.351 --> 02:06:35.132]  I think that there will be a lot of litigation that will bring a lot of attention to this issue.
[02:06:35.572 --> 02:06:38.573]  They may well try and push another pandemic agenda.
[02:06:39.493 --> 02:06:41.553]  It will fail, and people are waking up.
[02:06:41.673 --> 02:06:42.073]  I agree.
[02:06:42.334 --> 02:06:43.934]  And the CEOs move on with the money.
[02:06:43.954 --> 02:06:44.934]  They don't care what happens to the company.
[02:06:44.954 --> 02:06:45.254]  They don't care.
[02:06:45.294 --> 02:06:45.814]  They don't care.
[02:06:45.914 --> 02:06:56.177]  And so our job is to keep getting that information out there, making the films, telling the stories, and winning, progressively winning over the right-thinking people.
[02:06:56.277 --> 02:06:56.957]  And we are winning.
[02:06:57.137 --> 02:06:57.557]  We are winning.
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:05.245]  You talk about the numbers, I mean, you were like five scientists 25 years ago, now it's, I mean, the tide's on your side.
[02:07:05.505 --> 02:07:08.647]  Oh yeah, more than half the world's adult population have now said...
[02:07:09.639 --> 02:07:13.282]  We do not believe this vaccine is either safe or effective or necessary.
[02:07:14.062 --> 02:07:14.883]  And you've lied to us.
[02:07:15.203 --> 02:07:16.004]  And we're not touching it.
[02:07:16.044 --> 02:07:16.364]  Thank you.
[02:07:16.764 --> 02:07:22.148]  Well, that's what that head of the UN vaccine program we showed on the train earlier, she said three years ago.
[02:07:22.188 --> 02:07:23.509]  She said, no one trusts us.
[02:07:24.150 --> 02:07:25.931]  Our scientists, our doctors don't believe us.
[02:07:26.652 --> 02:07:28.113]  No one's ever going to take vaccines again.
[02:07:28.173 --> 02:07:29.354]  And then they double down.
[02:07:29.614 --> 02:07:30.354]  It's crazy.
[02:07:30.755 --> 02:07:32.136]  They have nowhere to go, Alex.
[02:07:32.176 --> 02:07:33.637]  They have nowhere to go.
[02:07:33.737 --> 02:07:36.765]   And once you start to lie, There's no way out.
[02:07:36.925 --> 02:07:39.467]  Once you start to commit scientific fraud, there's no way out.
[02:07:39.607 --> 02:07:40.408]  It just gets worse.
[02:07:40.708 --> 02:07:43.750]  You have to keep covering up the last mistake, the last lie you told.
[02:07:44.451 --> 02:07:47.473]  And it just, eventually the public turn around and say, enough.
[02:07:48.034 --> 02:07:48.854]  And that's what's happening now.
[02:07:49.715 --> 02:07:52.938]  So we think of evil people, at least I do, as like super villains that are invincible.
[02:07:53.218 --> 02:07:53.878]  They're really not.
[02:07:53.898 --> 02:07:54.599]  They're really a joke.
[02:07:54.879 --> 02:07:58.983]  It's like Hitler attacking North Africa and Poland and France and England and Russia.
[02:07:59.003 --> 02:07:59.803]  Like, what was he thinking?
[02:08:00.184 --> 02:08:01.204]  He's just a mad dog.
[02:08:01.645 --> 02:08:02.846]  I mean, they're just mad dogs.
[02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:06.281]  Yeah, I think they're motivated by certain things.
[02:08:06.342 --> 02:08:08.783]  Some have this grand scientific agenda.
[02:08:08.843 --> 02:08:10.444]  Some, it's pure profit.
[02:08:10.924 --> 02:08:12.245]  Some, we'll never know.
[02:08:12.465 --> 02:08:16.928]  But there is this sort of corporate mentality that, well, he's doing it, so I'll do it.
[02:08:17.028 --> 02:08:19.289]  He told me to do it, so I'm okay doing it.
[02:08:19.409 --> 02:08:19.549]  No.
[02:08:20.070 --> 02:08:21.190]  I feel protected from liability.
[02:08:21.210 --> 02:08:25.813]  They've got to take personal responsibility as well as corporate responsibility for their actions.
[02:08:25.893 --> 02:08:29.115]  And if they don't do that and people get hurt, then they're going to pay a price.
[02:08:29.235 --> 02:08:29.856]  That's the answer.
[02:08:29.916 --> 02:08:30.896]  Holding them responsible.
[02:08:31.297 --> 02:08:33.238]  Infertility, a diabolical agenda.
[02:08:33.258 --> 02:08:35.120]  The free film is out right now.
[02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:38.103]  We'll put that URL on screen for TV viewers.
[02:08:38.623 --> 02:08:41.325]  And Dr. Wakefield, thank you so much for all you've done.
[02:08:41.766 --> 02:08:43.347]  Please don't come back every two years.
[02:08:43.747 --> 02:08:44.928]  Infertilitythemovie.com.
[02:08:45.269 --> 02:08:46.970]  Please come back on a routine basis.
[02:08:47.150 --> 02:08:47.450]  Will do.
[02:08:47.470 --> 02:08:48.011]  Thank you so much.
[02:08:48.091 --> 02:08:48.772]  God bless you, brother.
[02:08:49.452 --> 02:08:49.892]  Great job.
[02:08:49.952 --> 02:08:51.273]  Totally vindicated right there.
[02:08:51.633 --> 02:08:52.313]  A real hero.
[02:08:52.814 --> 02:08:53.174]  All right.
[02:08:53.454 --> 02:08:54.995]  Special guest coming up next hour.
[02:08:55.015 --> 02:08:56.375]  I got five more minutes I'm going to do.
[02:08:56.836 --> 02:09:00.997]  And then the special guest takes over in the War Room at 3 p.m.
[02:09:01.017 --> 02:09:01.338]  today.
[02:09:01.838 --> 02:09:02.298]  Central.
[02:09:02.418 --> 02:09:04.079]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:09:04.519 --> 02:09:06.120]  Infertility, a diabolical agenda.
[02:09:06.460 --> 02:09:08.021]  Dr. Wakefield, let me shake your hand before you leave.
[02:09:08.801 --> 02:09:10.082]  That guy is a hero right there.
[02:09:10.442 --> 02:09:11.302]  That's my great job.
[02:09:11.322 --> 02:09:12.303]  I get to know people like this.
[02:09:12.783 --> 02:09:13.123]  Thank you.
[02:09:13.163 --> 02:09:13.563]  I love you.
[02:09:13.904 --> 02:09:14.404]  God bless you.
[02:09:15.164 --> 02:09:18.966]  Coming up in about three months, it's going to be 29 years I've been on air.
[02:09:20.171 --> 02:09:22.372]  And it's all about the people.
[02:09:22.432 --> 02:09:23.393]  It's all about humanity.
[02:09:23.453 --> 02:09:25.294]  It's all about resistance.
[02:09:25.354 --> 02:09:26.234]  And it's so empowering.
[02:09:26.274 --> 02:09:26.975]  It's so amazing.
[02:09:27.655 --> 02:09:29.476]  We have a guest host that's about to take over.
[02:09:30.917 --> 02:09:41.002]  But I mean, I got to tell you, just quite frankly, to listeners before Jay Dyer takes over, that I am extremely proud to be on air with you here today.
[02:09:41.542 --> 02:09:43.223]  And I'm extremely blessed to be here with you.
[02:09:44.424 --> 02:09:50.819]   And we are Way God's always had this work, like the widows might.
[02:09:51.580 --> 02:09:53.320]  We are always right on the edge of destruction.
[02:09:54.821 --> 02:09:56.962]  And that's how God shows us that God's in charge.
[02:09:57.702 --> 02:09:58.883]  But God works through you.
[02:09:59.783 --> 02:10:20.000]   So I want to ask all of you today, whether it was the Steve Bannon interview that was unbelievably powerful, or the Andrew Tate information that was incredibly important, or whether it was Andrew Wakefield that is about the very destiny and essence of human life on this planet, The only way these emergency messages, these SOS transmissions get out is you.
[02:10:20.701 --> 02:10:21.522]  And I believe in you.
[02:10:21.782 --> 02:10:22.703]  I know you're incredible.
[02:10:22.803 --> 02:10:23.744]  I know you took us here.
[02:10:24.044 --> 02:10:27.047]  I don't sit and look in the mirror and go, Alex Jones, you're this incredible person.
[02:10:27.227 --> 02:10:29.549]  No, I go, man, I gotta fight harder.
[02:10:30.129 --> 02:10:31.150]  And God's watching me.
[02:10:31.330 --> 02:10:32.612]  And thank God for my listeners.
[02:10:33.312 --> 02:10:35.674]  That's why when listeners call in and say, oh, Alex, you're so great.
[02:10:35.714 --> 02:10:36.415]  Oh, you're so wonderful.
[02:10:36.435 --> 02:10:37.056]  I love you so much.
[02:10:37.156 --> 02:10:38.357]  I just say, shut up.
[02:10:39.406 --> 02:10:40.167]  You love freedom.
[02:10:40.307 --> 02:10:40.947]  I love freedom.
[02:10:41.308 --> 02:10:42.048]  We're together.
[02:10:42.328 --> 02:10:42.969]  I need you.
[02:10:43.009 --> 02:10:45.351]  You need me, like a life raft in the middle of the ocean.
[02:10:46.352 --> 02:10:47.873]  It's not about thanking each other.
[02:10:48.213 --> 02:10:48.974]  That's not bad.
[02:10:49.094 --> 02:10:49.434]  I get it.
[02:10:49.454 --> 02:10:49.794]  I love you.
[02:10:49.814 --> 02:10:50.275]  You love me.
[02:10:50.635 --> 02:10:52.537]  We are literally in a war.
[02:10:53.878 --> 02:10:57.921]  This isn't about being heroes, and it's not about how cool we are.
[02:10:58.021 --> 02:11:01.364]  It's about, dammit, we are powerful together.
[02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:09.585]  That's why I hate them brainwashing and financing black supremacists all over the country just machine gunning white people.
[02:11:10.666 --> 02:11:12.448]  And as a white person, yeah, I don't like that.
[02:11:12.468 --> 02:11:15.631]  I don't like black people being machine gunned or killed with their babies.
[02:11:16.291 --> 02:11:18.773]  We're all together and this is BS.
[02:11:19.414 --> 02:11:20.315]  This is a lie.
[02:11:21.656 --> 02:11:22.476]  It's a lie.
[02:11:23.657 --> 02:11:24.658]  And I believe in you.
[02:11:24.698 --> 02:11:26.120]  We've got to beat these people.
[02:11:26.140 --> 02:11:28.381]  We've got to get wise to what they're doing.
[02:11:32.775 --> 02:11:34.176]  God always keeps me in this position.
[02:11:34.976 --> 02:11:36.677]  And I'm not going to attack God.
[02:11:36.717 --> 02:11:38.438]  I love God, but it is frustrating.
[02:11:39.539 --> 02:11:42.800]  Someone's like, God, why do you always keep you right on the edge of being shut down?
[02:11:42.820 --> 02:11:46.042]  Why do you always keep me right on the edge of not being on air?
[02:11:46.102 --> 02:11:48.403]  And God's like, because that keeps your ass on your toes, boy.
[02:11:49.244 --> 02:11:49.524]  That's why.
[02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:53.401]  It's only when you're in your ass kicked that you're strong.
[02:11:54.022 --> 02:11:55.102]  So I get God's plan.
[02:11:55.443 --> 02:11:56.323]  I'm not bitching about it.
[02:11:56.403 --> 02:11:56.803]  I get it.
[02:11:57.384 --> 02:12:01.987]  But man, I'd like to at least have 10% in the gas tank.
[02:12:02.307 --> 02:12:10.312]  Like I'd like to be just a little above E instead of always on E. Like the other day I was driving around after work and I realized, my gosh, I'm way below E. I'm about to run out.
[02:12:10.692 --> 02:12:13.013]  Because I know my car, it runs out after it gets down there.
[02:12:13.313 --> 02:12:14.793]  I was like, hurry into a gas station.
[02:12:15.133 --> 02:12:18.454]  I'm like, okay God, can I just be a little above-y all the time?
[02:12:18.894 --> 02:12:22.175]  But the way the universe works, God goes, no, you're below-y, bitch.
[02:12:23.075 --> 02:12:27.096]  Because you're going to know right when it's all getting shut down, I do it again.
[02:12:28.196 --> 02:12:29.036]  That's how God works.
[02:12:29.136 --> 02:12:33.237]  It's just, I love God, I appreciate God, keeps me on my toes.
[02:12:34.269 --> 02:12:35.550]  We need your word of mouth.
[02:12:35.610 --> 02:12:37.372]  We need you to share the articles and videos.

[02:12:57.603 --> 02:13:07.816]  Man, I spend, I'm not bitching, but God Almighty, I spend three, four, five hours a day just trying to raise money, and I want to be cutting reports, making films, writing books, and I'm not bitching.
[02:13:07.836 --> 02:13:11.040]  It's all part of God's plan, but darn it.
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:13.101]  It makes me mad.
[02:13:13.501 --> 02:13:24.429]  I'm not mad at God, but I'm just like, man, I'm spending all day trying to get money to keep the satellite up like there's $20,000 a month up and $200,000 a month of bandwidth and all this.
[02:13:24.809 --> 02:13:32.235]  So just please go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get these amazing products because I got big work to do, but I need your support.
[02:13:32.575 --> 02:13:33.756]  I can't do it without you.
[02:13:34.389 --> 02:13:36.850]  We'll be right back with Jay Dyer, straight ahead.
[02:13:37.291 --> 02:13:38.872]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:38.892 --> 02:13:43.794]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis, and glad to be back on this fourth hour.
[02:13:43.814 --> 02:13:53.420]  You know, I uncovered some really fascinating things that back up a lot of the research that I've done in the last couple of years, and that ties in very closely with the death of the Queen.
[02:13:54.850 --> 02:14:25.030]   And one of the books that I want to talk about that is kind of a forgotten text was back in 1981, there was a futurist book that included sort of an anthology of a bunch of the global elite writers, everybody from Carl Rogers to Jonas Salk to Tim Leary to Marilyn Ferguson to many, many others, Barbara Marx Hubbards, all of whom were pushing The Global Elite Ideas back in 1981 at that agent of change level, right?
[02:14:25.050 --> 02:14:26.691]  The culture pusher types of people.
[02:14:27.692 --> 02:14:42.445]  And one of the fascinating chapters in this book, again in 1981, which I did mention I think some years back, was by Willis Harmon, who was one of the co-publishers of another famous elite text, the Stanford Research Institute Changing Images of Man.
[02:14:42.465 --> 02:14:47.147]   He wrote a famous Peace in this book called Millennium.
[02:14:47.207 --> 02:14:50.487]  And Millennium was about where we would be by our day, right?
[02:14:50.527 --> 02:14:51.427]  Where we are right now.
[02:14:52.348 --> 02:14:55.788]  And this chapter is about what work would be like in the future.
[02:14:55.848 --> 02:15:07.951]  And this is another one of those key texts for demonstrating that the writings of the elite themselves had planned the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and maybe even 100 years into the future as best they could.
[02:15:08.011 --> 02:15:13.432]  It doesn't mean that necessarily it will happen, but from their vantage point, that's where they intend to take things.
[02:15:14.153 --> 02:15:23.479]  So, Willis Harmon, the white paper author, wrote a paper in this about what work would be like in the future.
[02:15:23.499 --> 02:15:28.663]  And one of the things he talks about is a term that you hear David Attenborough used to say all the time.
[02:15:28.703 --> 02:15:31.124]  Well, of course, we've got the extra people.
[02:15:31.545 --> 02:15:34.246]  What are we going to do with all the extra people?
[02:15:34.927 --> 02:15:39.590]  The extra people run about the world like little ants in an ant colony.
[02:15:39.850 --> 02:15:41.191]  Perhaps we need to stamp them out.
[02:15:42.182 --> 02:15:51.997]  Literally, that's what David Attenborough, as you guys know, probably a good friend of Prince Charles, who recently passed away as well, talked about the extra people.
[02:15:52.037 --> 02:15:54.962]  And the extra people are those who are not essential workers.
[02:15:56.215 --> 02:16:05.638]  So this idea of essential and non-essential workers actually goes back to the 70s and 80s with the acceptance of various austerity doctrines on the part of the elite.
[02:16:06.078 --> 02:16:10.500]  Now that had been kind of policy for a long time in the Anglo-American establishment at higher levels.
[02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:15.361]  It had been the running program of the British Empire for hundreds of years, right?
[02:16:15.401 --> 02:16:23.964]  At least going back to perhaps even the Elizabethan period, which I'm going to show you some interesting things that goes into the mythology of the British Empire when we look at Edmund Spencer.
[02:16:25.342 --> 02:16:31.006]  All the way back to the Fairy Queen and Queen Elizabeth and her esoteric ideas about herself and the Empire.
[02:16:31.526 --> 02:16:40.491]  But if we fast forward to the 70s and 80s, you have the acceptance of State Department Memorandum 200, the Kissinger document, which deals with depopulation.
[02:16:40.792 --> 02:16:55.321]   You have the acceptance in 1969 or 70 of the Bernard Berelson Jaffe Memo, which if you look up the Jaffe Memo, it deals with The introduction of the principles of the 60s sexual counterculture revolution into mass society.
[02:16:55.361 --> 02:17:02.666]  So they're actually saying that what's going on in the counterculture revolution should be promoted on a mass scale to all of the West.
[02:17:03.206 --> 02:17:03.526]  Why?
[02:17:03.766 --> 02:17:07.989]  Obviously for the purpose of discouraging population production.
[02:17:08.689 --> 02:17:12.332]  Reducing the number, getting it down to ZPG and then eventually negative growth rates.
[02:17:13.092 --> 02:17:18.716]  So back to this Willis Harman paper after discussing the extra people or what he calls the pointless people.
[02:17:20.672 --> 02:17:26.558]  He says that we're going to have to come up with different ideas to structure the way that we see work.
[02:17:27.199 --> 02:17:34.186]  And in the dystopia, in the technocratic era, it will be a tiered system where there's essential and non-essential workers.
[02:17:34.226 --> 02:17:36.529]  So they already had essential and non-essential worker.
[02:17:37.432 --> 02:17:40.814]  Graft out back in the 70s and early 80s.
[02:17:40.835 --> 02:17:42.396]  This is a 1981 text.
[02:17:42.436 --> 02:17:44.997]  Again, people hit me up asking me, where's that book?
[02:17:45.098 --> 02:17:45.538]  All the time.
[02:17:46.338 --> 02:17:47.339]  I don't know if it's still in print.
[02:17:47.379 --> 02:17:48.000]  It's probably not.
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:53.824]  I had it recommended to me by a really in-depth researcher, and I just happened to get one of the last copies.
[02:17:53.864 --> 02:17:58.547]  And every time I talk about these Google elite texts, they go up hundreds of dollars on Amazon.
[02:17:58.587 --> 02:18:01.009]  You can't get them anymore because most of these are actually out of print.
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:08.347]  Well, he goes on to talk about the structure of the American economy in different periods of big change, right?
[02:18:08.387 --> 02:18:18.049]   So from the Industrial Revolution and then to the Depression and then to the modernization of the American economy, he says that the consumer model Was done by design.
[02:18:18.069 --> 02:18:31.693]  So transitioning America from a, and the West, from a production-based economy to a consumerist-based economy was by design, and the introduction of the Great Society and the giant massive welfare programs were by design.
[02:18:31.754 --> 02:18:50.897]   And thus you can see a pattern, for example, this is my commentary, not Harmon, in the way that the government, Big Daddy government, treated the first American Indians, giving them reservations and giving them welfare as a way not to help them but to control Then you see that same model applied to the black community to control them.
[02:18:51.778 --> 02:18:56.722]  Now that model, which was done on those two groups, is now being done on everybody in the West.
[02:18:57.282 --> 02:19:05.928]  So, this is a studied, researched warfare plan intent on restructuring all of modern society.
[02:19:06.028 --> 02:19:09.250]  Not just America, not just the West, but the entire globe.
[02:19:09.630 --> 02:19:15.955]  That's why you saw in the last two years of the CUFID crisis, all of these programs and policies were global now.
[02:19:16.619 --> 02:19:18.339]  Oh, you have elected officials?
[02:19:18.359 --> 02:19:18.740]  Doesn't matter.
[02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:19.580]  Now you listen to the UN.
[02:19:20.300 --> 02:19:21.300]  Now you listen to the CDC.
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:22.220]  Now they tell you everything.
[02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:23.181]  The CDC listens to the UN.
[02:19:23.381 --> 02:19:26.702]  They listen to the Rockefeller Foundation and the Gilbast Foundation, right?
[02:19:26.742 --> 02:19:27.522]  And that's for the whole world.
[02:19:28.862 --> 02:19:36.104]  Showing that the structure for a proto-global government is already in place and that was set up out of the 20th century's wars and the Cold War.
[02:19:36.244 --> 02:19:58.738]   That was the whole point of those two world wars and the Cold War, according to Dr. Quigley, was the resurrection of the dead Pax Britannia And the now-dying Pax Americana into its third snakeskin-shedding manifestation of the global order, the technocratic Great Reset order.
[02:20:00.498 --> 02:20:04.419]  Now, Harman goes on in this essay to discuss the halting of growth.
[02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:10.014]   He says that in the future, Growth will have to stop in terms of the economy.
[02:20:10.054 --> 02:20:15.716]  We can't have boomers and the boomer mindset of ever-expanding growth.
[02:20:16.137 --> 02:20:17.237]  That has to be done away with.
[02:20:17.317 --> 02:20:28.222]  Again, remember, even though they admit and take credit for the American economy exploding and the baby boom, right, they say, oh, this was actually done by design for one phase.
[02:20:29.008 --> 02:20:35.753]  Then we will demonize and guilt trip everybody for consumerism, which was sold from the top down, right?
[02:20:35.853 --> 02:20:40.896]  The idea of deindustrialization was so that you could have a service economy and consumerism.
[02:20:41.396 --> 02:20:47.340]  Now you're told that consumerism and service economy is evil, bad, destroying the planet, but that's all a lie.
[02:20:47.380 --> 02:20:54.405]  It's all a ruse to transition everybody into, on the basis of a mass guilt trip, a Malthusian technocracy.
[02:20:55.811 --> 02:21:03.477]  So he says that we're going to have to understand that growth will be slowed and in the future automatization will replace workers.
[02:21:03.718 --> 02:21:04.918]  There won't be human workers.
[02:21:05.099 --> 02:21:11.684]  I just saw the other day video clips of now in fruit fields, there's no longer human workers.
[02:21:11.764 --> 02:21:13.045]  That's now done by robots.
[02:21:13.606 --> 02:21:16.948]  Fast food is transitioning now to you just order from a robot.
[02:21:17.389 --> 02:21:20.771]  Going into grocery stores and even convenience stores now, it's all self-checkout.
[02:21:20.810 --> 02:21:23.250]  So there's not gonna be checkout people anymore.
[02:21:23.250 --> 02:21:28.770]   And this is under the guise of number one, they'll say, well, it's ease and efficiency, right?
[02:21:28.770 --> 02:21:30.909]  That's what everything is sold as.
[02:21:30.909 --> 02:21:35.950]   It saves energy, it's more efficient, which there might be some truth to those things,
[02:21:35.950 --> 02:21:41.751]   but then the payoff is even worse because now what happens is we have all of these extra
[02:21:41.751 --> 02:21:45.670]   people according to the elites, according to David Attenborough,
[02:21:45.969 --> 02:21:51.675]  World Wildlife Foundation, all of Prince Charles's groups, all of these Royal Society created groups.
[02:21:51.715 --> 02:21:54.378]  And by the way, Harman wrote and worked with the Royal Society.
[02:21:54.418 --> 02:21:55.098]  So keep that in mind.
[02:21:56.560 --> 02:22:08.011]  He says that what we're going to have to have is a post-industrial society based around austerity and shared circular borrowing.
[02:22:08.866 --> 02:22:18.208]  So when you hear people at TED Talks like Ida Alkin, promoted by Klaus, the World Economic Forum, when they talk about a circular economy, they're talking about you not owning anything.
[02:22:18.508 --> 02:22:19.868]  You will own nothing and you'll be happy.
[02:22:20.268 --> 02:22:21.228]  The circular economy.
[02:22:21.428 --> 02:22:22.209]  You will own nothing.
[02:22:22.489 --> 02:22:28.290]  You will have to share the whitey tighties, the underwear across your entire neighborhood.
[02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:29.810]  There will be one pair.
[02:22:30.070 --> 02:22:30.750]  You will share it.
[02:22:30.810 --> 02:22:33.431]  It will become dingy brown and you will have to share it anyway.
[02:22:33.511 --> 02:22:34.291]  That's what Klaus says.
[02:22:34.958 --> 02:22:35.318]  Literally.
[02:22:35.778 --> 02:22:36.579]  About his whitey tights?
[02:22:36.619 --> 02:22:37.099]  Not really.
[02:22:37.119 --> 02:22:38.900]  He says that you will have a circular economy.
[02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:41.041]  He says that you already have the Uber.
[02:22:41.321 --> 02:22:42.541]  You have the Uber already.
[02:22:42.862 --> 02:22:45.323]  Therefore, you've already accepted what I'm telling you about.
[02:22:46.263 --> 02:22:47.384]  He literally does say that, right?
[02:22:47.424 --> 02:22:48.384]  So the word's a fallacy, right?
[02:22:48.424 --> 02:22:57.728]  Just because people use Uber doesn't mean that I've opted in now to a total communist technocracy where all people's property is shared.
[02:22:57.748 --> 02:23:01.210]  I mean, by the way, wouldn't that include whitey tighties and underwear?
[02:23:01.270 --> 02:23:03.751]  I mean, if you're not going to have any property, you're not going to have underwear.
[02:23:04.599 --> 02:23:05.300]  You're going to have to share it.
[02:23:08.143 --> 02:23:14.571]  And so he says that post-industrial society will lead to communism by design and universal basic income back in 1981.
[02:23:16.767 --> 02:23:21.371]  This is way ahead of its time, and it literally talks about post-industrial society.
[02:23:21.531 --> 02:23:23.332]  Post-industrial, right?
[02:23:23.452 --> 02:23:24.413]  That's austerity.
[02:23:24.473 --> 02:23:25.654]  That's you going back to 1800s.
[02:23:25.834 --> 02:23:28.516]  That's you going back to Prairie, Little House on the Prairie.
[02:23:28.536 --> 02:23:29.017]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:23:29.037 --> 02:23:29.697]  This is Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:29.717 --> 02:23:30.578]  I'm your host, Jay Dyer.
[02:23:31.078 --> 02:23:33.120]  Welcome back to the 1800s.
[02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:35.602]  You're going to enjoy the 1800s.
[02:23:35.622 --> 02:23:38.184]  You will live in the Little House on the Prairie.
[02:23:38.504 --> 02:23:40.085]  You will be churning the butter.
[02:23:40.485 --> 02:23:43.548]  You will be sewing the New Balance sneakers for yourself.
[02:23:44.224 --> 02:23:45.005]  It will be great.
[02:23:45.305 --> 02:23:46.927]  It will be great for the environment.
[02:23:47.248 --> 02:23:49.391]  You're going to live in Little House on the Prairie.
[02:23:49.411 --> 02:23:56.279]  You will have the greasy, oily Michael Landon out front in the Amish tank top.
[02:23:56.539 --> 02:23:59.343]  He will be chopping the wood for you to heat your house.
[02:23:59.723 --> 02:24:01.085]  After that, we will kill you.
[02:24:01.886 --> 02:24:04.548]  It's going to be great living in a little house on a prairie.
[02:24:04.608 --> 02:24:08.530]  I've always wanted to watch Michael Landon chopping wood outside.
[02:24:08.590 --> 02:24:14.594]  We've got to get those numbers down and when we're able to sew our own New Balance sneakers, we're going to save Mother Earth.
[02:24:15.135 --> 02:24:16.316]  Listen, that's not a joke.
[02:24:16.356 --> 02:24:17.576]  That is a joke, but it's not a joke.
[02:24:17.596 --> 02:24:18.297]  But it is a joke.
[02:24:18.917 --> 02:24:28.844]  And that's because that's actually what's in this piece about the post-industrial society and austerity being brought in by design.
[02:24:29.898 --> 02:24:30.979]  After catastrophes.
[02:24:31.199 --> 02:24:32.601]  Oh, I wonder what catastrophes.
[02:24:33.101 --> 02:24:38.666]  This great research is the perfect excuse for us to bring in the new very old.
[02:24:40.287 --> 02:24:42.349]  So what is this going to look like?
[02:24:42.429 --> 02:24:44.611]  What is this circular economy that we keep hearing about?
[02:24:44.711 --> 02:24:49.055]  And so I'm going to get into more of that from the Millennium Essay from Willis Harmon.
[02:24:50.265 --> 02:25:02.192]  In this technocratic society, how predictive it was, especially for the CUFID era and for what we see in Operation Lockstep and what we see being rolled out right now post Great Reset, or at least the initial phases of this.
[02:25:02.812 --> 02:25:04.673]  What have we seen in the last few weeks, right?
[02:25:04.693 --> 02:25:06.294]  What did Alex cover all week long?
[02:25:06.854 --> 02:25:16.620]  Shutting off power grids, shutting off water, shutting down farms, factory farms, cows, you can't have your own cattle, you can't have your own food sources, etc, etc.
[02:25:16.660 --> 02:25:37.698]   So that's all by design because as Willis Harman wrote, following the Stanford Research Plans from the 1970s, again following the Royal Society British Imperial Malthusian Plan from decades prior to that, centuries prior to that, the Post-Industrial Society, he says, begins with the idea of a
[02:25:39.469 --> 02:25:45.332]  Universal welfare system based on some kind of token given out that will be the central bank digital currency.
[02:25:45.372 --> 02:25:51.775]  The Bank for National Settlements will probably have some some attempt at an international universal based income.
[02:25:51.875 --> 02:25:56.117]  It'll probably roll out through the tech companies through Facebook and things like this.
[02:25:57.688 --> 02:26:05.611]  And it says that everybody will be on welfare, because again, remember, what did we see with the placing of the American Indians on welfare and the black community on welfare?
[02:26:05.651 --> 02:26:26.919]  I'm not saying that there can't be a legitimate place for welfare or something like that, but the point is rather that even though these communities might have been due some aid for what they've gone through, the real reason that the government, the federal government and the Federal Reserve, etc., were putting people on these was not actually to help them, but was rather to control and enslave them.
[02:26:28.619 --> 02:26:33.864]  Now that model, and if you remember Alex way long time ago, back in the day, he used to have Russell Means on.
[02:26:33.905 --> 02:26:43.454]  And Russell Means would always make this very point that the model that they use for the Native Americans is exactly the model that the New World Order will use for the entire world.
[02:26:44.195 --> 02:26:45.817]  He was way ahead of his time on that point.
[02:26:45.857 --> 02:26:47.198]  That was perfectly accurate.
[02:26:48.024 --> 02:26:52.788]  And again, the point is not that welfare is bad or that people shouldn't get assistance when they need it.
[02:26:53.269 --> 02:27:09.563]  The point is that the intention of giving everyone welfare in various communities and then expanding that to the world where a universal basic income is not so that you can lay around in your coon pod and have fun all day playing video games and sleeping with dragons in the metaverse.
[02:27:09.624 --> 02:27:11.265]  That's not what the purpose of it is.
[02:27:11.305 --> 02:27:13.447]  The purpose is control and enslavement.
[02:27:14.033 --> 02:27:18.534]  And he says, everybody that buys into this is an extra person.
[02:27:19.074 --> 02:27:19.554]  Extra people.
[02:27:20.855 --> 02:27:24.856]  Have you ever watched the BBC Nature series with David Attenborough?
[02:27:25.396 --> 02:27:30.497]  And the many lectures and talks that he would give and all these globalist confabs over the last several decades?
[02:27:31.497 --> 02:27:32.478]  Well, the extra people.
[02:27:32.698 --> 02:27:33.378]  What are we to do?
[02:27:33.898 --> 02:27:34.118]  Why?
[02:27:34.618 --> 02:27:35.999]  There's so many extra people.
[02:27:36.419 --> 02:27:37.479]  It makes me sick in my stomach.
[02:27:37.975 --> 02:27:44.116]  There's going to be some way in which we're able to crush and destroy all of the extra people, to get rid of them.
[02:27:44.816 --> 02:27:46.777]  Literally what's on the Georgia Geisel, okay?
[02:27:46.837 --> 02:27:48.337]  So again, we know this is a real plan.
[02:27:48.857 --> 02:27:50.857]  It even says extra people in here, okay?
[02:27:50.997 --> 02:27:51.517]  The extra people.
[02:27:53.398 --> 02:27:57.339]  He says the key to understand the future will be a needs-based economy.
[02:27:57.779 --> 02:28:05.180]  Not an economy where you have sovereignty, where you have private property, where you have wealth, where you have independence.
[02:28:05.942 --> 02:28:11.823]  But a completely controlled, tracked, surveilled economy based around needs.
[02:28:11.863 --> 02:28:13.784]  Well, who decides what is the need?
[02:28:15.424 --> 02:28:16.484]  Oh, they do, you see.
[02:28:16.664 --> 02:28:25.746]  A centrally controlled technocratic society, a needs according to an austerity-based presupposition economy, you see.
[02:28:26.386 --> 02:28:31.107]  So, the needs are determined on the basis of what the system says in individual needs.
[02:28:31.247 --> 02:28:33.828]  And by the way, they eventually say that you don't need to be here.
[02:28:34.460 --> 02:28:36.101]  You need to go, you see.
[02:28:36.121 --> 02:29:02.684]  He goes on to say that everyone who believes in an individual right, in any sense whatsoever, whether you're a libertarian, or whether you're just an independent anarchist, or whether you're a Christian who believes that you're made in the image of God, so you have some individual identity, he says, everyone who believes in any kind of individual identity will be submerged in, or submissive to, the collective identity.
[02:29:03.436 --> 02:29:03.636]  Right?
[02:29:03.676 --> 02:29:05.678]  Now, who decides what the collective identity?
[02:29:05.718 --> 02:29:07.100]  Oh, well, of course, the technocrats, you see.
[02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:16.288]  So, this is the transition from rule by politics and so-called democracy, which we all know we don't really have democracy or anything like that, right?
[02:29:16.649 --> 02:29:21.053]  There's the front of elected leaders and so forth.
[02:29:21.413 --> 02:29:23.075]  There's the frontispiece of all that.
[02:29:23.135 --> 02:29:28.600]  But really, we've been, as Dr. Quigley says for a long time, controlled by an oligarchical elite.
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:44.499]   He goes on to say that in the future you see everything will be given on the basis of what the system determines that you need and you will only have Posterity, if the system decides that you are allowed to have posterity, because you're bad for the planet.
[02:29:44.539 --> 02:30:02.586]  Now, this is mind-boggling, because this is everything that is in the National Socialist program, their agenda, when it came to mass sterilizations, when it came to their philosophy, but now it's all just been rebranded as this sort of tech nerd liberalism, and it's all cool.
[02:30:02.806 --> 02:30:03.626]  It's all great, right?
[02:30:03.986 --> 02:30:13.638]   And he literally says it will be a collectivist, austerity-based system, And he talks about, again, this is 1981, tiny houses, tiny living.
[02:30:14.359 --> 02:30:19.182]  You will work from home in the future, if you even have work.
[02:30:19.302 --> 02:30:26.266]  In 1981, that you would work from home was planned by technocrats in the 70s and 80s.
[02:30:30.909 --> 02:30:38.431]   He says that, and this is something you've heard Alex talk about a lot, which Willis Harman says, he says that This is going to be more like...
[02:30:39.847 --> 02:30:41.088]  The Middle Ages.
[02:30:41.608 --> 02:30:46.571]  Now, uh, trad-minded people are like, oh yeah, beige, trad, it's gonna be Middle Ages.
[02:30:46.591 --> 02:30:47.051]  No, no, no.
[02:30:47.371 --> 02:30:54.695]  It's not Middle Ages where you have a feudal lord and you're a knight who, you know, dies for virtuous noble causes.
[02:30:54.855 --> 02:31:06.562]  No, no, this is Mark Zuckerberg is your feudal lord and he's sitting over there with giant goblets and big chunks of steak and you're eating kibble on his plantation, you see.
[02:31:06.982 --> 02:31:19.288]   It literally says that the Middle Ages And the idea of the feudal system is more accurately the type of system that they will bring in where you live on the, it's like the company town.
[02:31:20.180 --> 02:31:31.649]  So if you don't know about this in American history, there used to be company towns and the corporation owned the mine and the town and your apartment and you basically just rented everything that you needed.
[02:31:31.969 --> 02:31:36.673]  Your gray underwear, your gray worker suit, your gray boots, your gray hat.
[02:31:37.574 --> 02:31:38.675]  Everything's gray, right?
[02:31:38.695 --> 02:31:39.495]  Your gray bread.
[02:31:39.535 --> 02:31:43.899]  You just rent that from the company store and you live on the company property.
[02:31:45.259 --> 02:31:46.780]  That's the medieval feudal model.
[02:31:47.240 --> 02:31:49.921]  It has nothing to do with being bathed in trad and medieval.
[02:31:50.041 --> 02:31:50.982]  That's not what we're talking about.
[02:31:51.002 --> 02:31:57.365]  Some of the worst aspects of medieval feudalism, of monopoly capitalism, of socialism, of democracy.
[02:31:58.126 --> 02:32:01.868]  All of the worst aspects of all those is what is going into this future system.
[02:32:03.949 --> 02:32:05.669]  And he says that we will not have any religions.
[02:32:05.790 --> 02:32:08.611]  It will be a purely, quote, science-based system.
[02:32:08.771 --> 02:32:11.052]  Technocracy will be science-based.
[02:32:11.092 --> 02:32:12.113]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:12.153 --> 02:32:12.653]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:32:12.693 --> 02:32:14.434]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:32:14.975 --> 02:32:16.456]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:16.476 --> 02:32:19.078]  I want to remind you guys to head on over to the InfoWars store.
[02:32:19.098 --> 02:32:23.282]  I actually just bought several things in the past couple weeks, especially the nascent iodine.
[02:32:23.322 --> 02:32:24.243]  I've been taking that every day.
[02:32:24.263 --> 02:32:25.884]  I love it.
[02:32:26.905 --> 02:32:28.166]  Really great products over there.
[02:32:28.186 --> 02:32:33.290]  There's a lot of DVDs, a lot of t-shirts, so definitely support Alex in the InfoWars store.
[02:32:34.185 --> 02:32:35.926]  And help us keep the fight going.
[02:32:35.966 --> 02:32:45.669]  Now we were talking about Willis Harman's Millennium essay where he gets into the role of work itself changing in the future because all of society will be revolutionized in the future.
[02:32:46.009 --> 02:32:52.972]  This is not revolution in some 1776 sense or some, you know, liberal utopia sense.
[02:32:53.052 --> 02:32:59.294]  This is the revolution which they call the final revolution to bring in the total technocratic control.
[02:32:59.834 --> 02:33:07.954]   The same people behind this revolution are the same people who helped Hitler, Mao, and Stalin come to power.
[02:33:08.374 --> 02:33:28.489]  Now, not everything that those dictators did went along their plans, but at least insofar as they wanted big wars, cold war, in that regard, the elite did get what they wanted, and that's what we find when we go deep into the writings of the elite in the 20th century, particularly in regard to the history of the British Empire, which I've read quite a bit about.
[02:33:29.136 --> 02:33:34.920]  Now, before we get to that, though, I want to end what Willis Harman was saying in The New Ethic.
[02:33:34.980 --> 02:33:37.602]  He says just the same as what Klaus says.
[02:33:37.622 --> 02:33:42.506]  Remember in Klaus's book, we will need the grand narrative, the great narrative.
[02:33:42.526 --> 02:33:44.147]  We need a new story, a new narrative.
[02:33:44.627 --> 02:33:46.228]  Same thing Willis Harman says in 1981.
[02:33:46.368 --> 02:33:55.227]   There will be a new ethic, a new story about What makes man virtuous or what makes man bad?
[02:33:55.407 --> 02:33:56.108]  Good and bad.
[02:33:56.408 --> 02:33:59.951]  The new good and bad will be eco-ethics.
[02:34:00.671 --> 02:34:01.812]  Ecological ethics.
[02:34:01.852 --> 02:34:02.593]  That's everything.
[02:34:02.953 --> 02:34:04.234]  They hinged everything on that.
[02:34:04.835 --> 02:34:07.377]  Go back to the first global revolution from the Club of Rome.
[02:34:07.457 --> 02:34:11.080]  It said that we will make humankind the key issue of pollution.
[02:34:11.380 --> 02:34:15.984]  Not just toxic pollutants in the sense of chemicals, plastics, etc.
[02:34:16.004 --> 02:34:16.785]  That's all true.
[02:34:17.498 --> 02:34:19.919]  But also human beings are a pollutant.
[02:34:20.339 --> 02:34:25.661]  Humans and carbon in that sense, as carbon is the base of life, those are the real pollutants in the world.
[02:34:25.741 --> 02:34:26.982]  They have to be depopulated.
[02:34:27.502 --> 02:34:34.525]  And the role of work, the role of everything will change based around, hinged around this linchpin of eco-ethics.
[02:34:35.285 --> 02:34:36.445]  But who says eco-ethics?
[02:34:36.465 --> 02:34:37.246]  What does that even mean?
[02:34:37.386 --> 02:34:38.106]  Eco-ethics.
[02:34:38.806 --> 02:34:43.028]  Who decides what's the proper number of human beings on the planet to balance out?
[02:34:43.792 --> 02:34:45.813]  The so-called sustainability agendas.
[02:34:46.173 --> 02:34:46.973]  Well, of course they do.
[02:34:47.153 --> 02:34:48.413]  The technocratic elite, they say.
[02:34:48.853 --> 02:34:49.033]  Right?
[02:34:50.194 --> 02:34:51.834]  So, again, it's totally arbitrary.
[02:34:52.094 --> 02:34:52.314]  Right?
[02:34:52.674 --> 02:34:54.135]  It's not actually justified.
[02:34:54.155 --> 02:34:56.695]  There's not a basis for why we should accept this system.
[02:34:56.775 --> 02:34:59.896]  It's a top-down authoritarian control, not based on logic.
[02:34:59.916 --> 02:35:00.676]  It's not based on logic.
[02:35:00.736 --> 02:35:12.215]   It's based on what evolution, according to them, in a completely socially planned society, That has evolved, according to them, from the individual to the collective.
[02:35:12.395 --> 02:35:14.696]  So you see, they just say, oh, evolution proves it.
[02:35:15.617 --> 02:35:22.100]  Evolution is evolving from you having individual rights to, clearly, the technocratic collectivist system.
[02:35:22.801 --> 02:35:24.582]  And you are no longer an individual.
[02:35:25.042 --> 02:35:27.724]  You're a cell in a macro-organism.
[02:35:28.964 --> 02:35:31.566]  You're a molecule in a larger system.
[02:35:32.125 --> 02:35:37.270]  So you have no identity at all apart from this arbitrary collective.
[02:35:37.450 --> 02:35:40.013]  Well, why should we hinge our identity on the collective?
[02:35:40.754 --> 02:35:42.676]  Maybe the collective is just made up of individuals.
[02:35:43.056 --> 02:35:45.138]  Maybe the individual is the starting point, right?
[02:35:46.359 --> 02:35:52.085]  I mean, why should we just assume that collective, the many, is prior to the one?
[02:35:52.185 --> 02:35:53.526]  Maybe the one is prior to the many.
[02:35:54.067 --> 02:35:55.048]  Maybe the many is prior to the one.
[02:35:55.666 --> 02:35:55.866]  Right?
[02:35:56.687 --> 02:36:01.951]  I mean, I have my own views, which I think Orthodox Christianity helps solve that classic philosophical problem.
[02:36:02.552 --> 02:36:13.060]  But from these people who don't believe in ethics, who don't believe in metaphysics, don't believe in epistemology, they supposedly just believe in quote science or scientism, there's no reason or basis to prefer one over the other.
[02:36:13.601 --> 02:36:16.082]  There's no such thing as even individuals or collectives.
[02:36:16.402 --> 02:36:17.863]  Those don't have any real identity.
[02:36:18.363 --> 02:36:19.944]  They're just human social constructs.
[02:36:20.324 --> 02:36:31.209]  So you see that this is a totally arbitrary, unjustified, in a philosophical sense, system that is based around pure power politics and social engineering.
[02:36:32.629 --> 02:36:36.031]  Now, I was mentioning the origins of this philosophy, right?
[02:36:36.071 --> 02:36:38.352]  Now, hopefully we know about Malthusianism.
[02:36:39.142 --> 02:36:51.535]  And that's, of course, the so-called minister, Thomas Malthus, who looked at flies flying around in a jar and said, oh, so the flies in the jar prove to me that there's limited resources.
[02:36:51.935 --> 02:36:57.961]  And so if we don't control the population in England within a generation or two, the whole country will collapse.
[02:36:58.762 --> 02:37:02.266]  So it was a fear-based narrative from Malthus back in his day.
[02:37:03.593 --> 02:37:10.440]  And then we get out of that the connection to the social Darwinian eugenics movement with the Galton's and the Huxley's and so forth.
[02:37:10.460 --> 02:37:18.489]  Those families all premised their ideology on the same idea of Malthusianism, intimately tied to social Darwinism.
[02:37:19.089 --> 02:37:26.237]  The idea that just whoever is in power has power because they are, in terms of biology, determined to have that power.
[02:37:26.969 --> 02:37:35.331]  And it doesn't matter how they got it, there is no ethic, there's no right or wrong, there's just power narratives, and there's just control, and there's just basically the worship of death.
[02:37:35.611 --> 02:37:38.032]  That's essentially what the Darwinian paradigm amounts to.
[02:37:38.472 --> 02:37:46.974]  The worship of death, and therefore it's justified for the elite, in their view, to get rid of most people because they're just furthering the evolutionary mechanism itself.
[02:37:47.454 --> 02:37:50.375]  Because death is what propels the system in that worldview.
[02:37:53.078 --> 02:37:54.599]  Where does this weird idea come from?
[02:37:54.719 --> 02:37:59.663]  Because we know that it's clearly opposite anything remotely Christian, right?
[02:37:59.683 --> 02:38:10.012]  There's no place at all in whether you're Protestant, Classically Protestant, Roman Catholic, Orthodox, there's not really any place at all for this idea of a death cult or a worship of death.
[02:38:10.052 --> 02:38:20.200]  I mean, everybody's theology in the West, at least loosely biblically based, believes that death is in some way overcome or the enemy or connected to the devil, right?
[02:38:20.841 --> 02:38:22.262]  So why would we have a death cult?
[02:38:23.012 --> 02:38:33.539]  Death cults are a return to ancient pagan animistic traditions or druidic traditions where the druids actually would worship death and believed in human sacrifice.
[02:38:33.559 --> 02:38:36.921]  So there was a need to placate Mother Earth.
[02:38:37.362 --> 02:38:43.586]  She craved blood and if she didn't get blood then she would wreak havoc in terms of storms and natural disasters.
[02:38:43.606 --> 02:38:49.490]  So it's like an ancient sort of superstitious pagan religion that they've revived under the guise of science.
[02:38:50.288 --> 02:39:04.135]  And Alex is 100% right when he says that many of the elite documents, UN documents, Arthur Kessler and others, actually said we need to bring back the ancient pagan idea of human sacrifice because they understood the balance of nature and sustainability.
[02:39:06.514 --> 02:39:24.905]  So, whether the people at the top of the pyramid are outright Satanists and believe that they're offering blood sacrifices to Lucifer himself, or whether they're just naturalists and believe that this is part of the cyclical, biological Earth process, it doesn't really matter, ultimately, because it's the same idea, the same game plan.
[02:39:25.766 --> 02:39:28.688]  That most people have to be gotten rid of because they're the extra people.
[02:39:29.068 --> 02:39:30.829]  The extra superfluous people.
[02:39:33.198 --> 02:39:34.919]  That's literally what he says.
[02:39:35.259 --> 02:39:36.620]  Harmon, superfluous people.
[02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:38.401]  Where does this idea come from?
[02:39:38.441 --> 02:39:57.070]  Well, if you go back to the Reformation, and particularly after Henry VIII and all that debacle, what grew in English religion was more and more of an interest in not just Enlightenment ideas, but in what we could call Hermeticism.
[02:39:57.965 --> 02:40:21.113]  And the Elizabethan period in particular, if you look at most of the literature, especially the arts, right, so English lit and so forth, if you go into the history of John Donne, Ben Johnson, Edmund Spencer, you know, even Shakespeare, you get this sort of pseudo-Christian stuff in the writings which cloaks Hermetic ideas.
[02:40:22.293 --> 02:40:32.350]   And the Hermetic principles there are Pushed very clearly, especially when you get into these weird esoteric documents like Edmund Spencer's Fairy Queen.
[02:40:32.951 --> 02:40:34.912]  Now you might think, what does it have to do with what you're talking about?
[02:40:34.932 --> 02:40:49.399]  Well, when I was doing my grad work, I got pretty deep into Elizabethan literature because so much of that literature was impregnated with pseudo-Christian ideas that cloaked hermeticism, alchemy, and occult ideas.
[02:40:50.385 --> 02:41:00.632]  And particularly in this case, what happened was, Elizabeth said, I want you, Edmund, to write for me the great mythological story for the British Empire.
[02:41:01.533 --> 02:41:04.395]  So remember, she's the Virgin Queen, supposedly.
[02:41:04.455 --> 02:41:13.050]   She has this image where she projected herself as a kind of state State-run Virgin Mary, literally.
[02:41:13.231 --> 02:41:20.355]  The artwork and the propaganda at that time projected her as the Virgin Queen, as the Virgin Mary, but she's the state queen.
[02:41:21.075 --> 02:41:22.476]  It's a quasi-religious thing.
[02:41:23.396 --> 02:41:26.198]  And so she said, I want Virgil's Aeneid for the British Empire.
[02:41:26.378 --> 02:41:35.443]  And so she got Spencer, who was not really Christian, more of an esotericist, to write this hermetic alchemical allegory for the British Empire.
[02:41:36.619 --> 02:41:42.401]  Again, as a propaganda piece, what Virgil's Aeneid was for the Roman Empire, this is supposed to be for the British Empire.
[02:41:43.101 --> 02:41:47.223]  And it's this weird, massive, alchemical, hermetic allegory.
[02:41:48.203 --> 02:41:52.104]  It talks about transmigration of souls, which is reincarnation.
[02:41:52.144 --> 02:41:53.145]  It's very bizarre, right?
[02:41:53.165 --> 02:41:53.805]  It's not Christian.
[02:41:53.945 --> 02:41:57.286]  When we come back, I'm going to tell you the secrets of the Fairy Queen.
[02:41:58.246 --> 02:42:00.828]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:00.848 --> 02:42:03.309]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:24.021]  We're getting into the history of the British Empire and its own occult mythology, its own concocted story, its own history about itself to set itself off as a kind of pseudo-Christian yet hermetic empire that would ultimately establish the great civilization to bring the nations into a progressive future.
[02:42:24.741 --> 02:42:28.684]  That's literally even what was included back at the time of Spencer's Ferry Quaint.
[02:42:28.964 --> 02:42:36.210]  The idea was that the British Empire would civilize the whole world because it was the most evolved, the most elite and so forth.
[02:42:37.395 --> 02:42:40.097]  Certainly the British Empire had some positives and it had some negatives.
[02:42:40.137 --> 02:43:10.400]   I'm not trying to go too deep into the empire itself, but what happens eventually is that that occult, esoteric ideology, as it drifted further and further away from its Christian roots in terms of Anglicanism and then whatever it is today, I don't know what religion we would call the British Empire today, maybe just outright Satanism, I don't know, but the further that it drifted away, the more it adopted principles That gave the appearance of being scientific, but we're not actually scientific, we're actually just another type of cult or religion.
[02:43:11.141 --> 02:43:28.034]  And I would give you, as proof of that, the history of the Royal Society, as detailed by the history of Freemasons, which is, there's a great book on this called Freemasonry and the Birth of Modern Science, and this is written by a guy who's part of that Royal Society Masonic structure.
[02:43:29.167 --> 02:43:38.090]  And the only reason I cite this book is because it's a history of the Royal Society in terms of their promotion of pragmatism, empiricism, and scientism.
[02:43:38.730 --> 02:43:45.253]  The ideas that foster evolution, rank materialism, and atheism across the world.
[02:43:45.673 --> 02:43:49.294]  We can thank the Royal Society for that for the last several centuries.
[02:43:49.995 --> 02:43:53.156]  And there's a method to this madness, though, is what I'm trying to say.
[02:43:53.196 --> 02:44:00.988]   There is an occult, esoteric philosophy Which is based around the idea very similar to Hinduism.
[02:44:01.389 --> 02:44:01.729]  Interesting.
[02:44:01.749 --> 02:44:11.052]  So, you know, ancient Hindu thought they had this idea of wheels of cyclical rebirths and the aeons of evolution, right, which is what produced man.
[02:44:11.112 --> 02:44:19.956]  Man is just on this journey in the hierarchical scale of being to where he can evolve to nirvana or he can be punished by being reincarnated as something lower.
[02:44:20.656 --> 02:44:26.535]   It's not by accident that the British Empire, when they made India a colony, utilized and
[02:44:26.535 --> 02:44:31.255]   appropriated a lot of these occult and esoteric pagan ideas from Hindu thought.
[02:44:31.255 --> 02:44:35.056]   They sort of brought that, especially the caste system, they brought that into a lot
[02:44:35.056 --> 02:44:36.615]  of their philosophy.
[02:44:36.615 --> 02:44:41.936]   And that's reflected in this Malthusian idea that the earth can only hold so many people,
[02:44:41.936 --> 02:44:46.896]   there's only so many resources, and so the answer to this is to get rid of most people.
[02:44:46.896 --> 02:44:50.256]  Obviously, this is from a demonic source.
[02:44:50.256 --> 02:44:55.176]   This notion is demonic, because we know the enemy of mankind is Satan.
[02:44:55.176 --> 02:45:00.656]   So the best explanation for why this is such a consistent, recurring pattern in history,
[02:45:00.656 --> 02:45:06.775]   and especially in the history of empires, is because it's a thought, an idea, a power
[02:45:06.775 --> 02:45:11.296]  behind human beings that pushes this idea, which is demonic.
[02:45:11.369 --> 02:45:12.509]  That's the best explanation.
[02:45:13.069 --> 02:45:17.446]   And that's why you see empires Collapsing eventually.
[02:45:17.506 --> 02:45:18.506]  Now, there's a couple exceptions.
[02:45:18.546 --> 02:45:21.388]  Byzantine Empire, it didn't fall into human sacrifice.
[02:45:21.808 --> 02:45:22.948]  It actually fell to Islam.
[02:45:22.968 --> 02:45:32.613]  But in terms of world pagan empires, they always fall into this trap because they're promoted by and fostered by the devil, I would say.
[02:45:33.013 --> 02:45:33.193]  Right?
[02:45:33.233 --> 02:45:34.934]  And that doesn't just have to be empires.
[02:45:34.954 --> 02:45:36.095]  You can have the 20th century.
[02:45:36.155 --> 02:45:37.715]  We have the century of Democide.
[02:45:38.256 --> 02:45:38.436]  Right?
[02:45:38.616 --> 02:45:39.796]  It can be any kind of leader.
[02:45:40.337 --> 02:45:47.688]   But when you get these leaders who want to kill everyone because they've gone psychotic and insane, The problem is more than just human.
[02:45:48.068 --> 02:45:49.129]  It's something more than that.
[02:45:49.189 --> 02:45:52.530]  It's something not just psychopathy, not just psychology.
[02:45:52.611 --> 02:45:53.451]  It's the demonic.
[02:45:53.851 --> 02:45:55.252]  And that's the key point I want to make here.
[02:45:55.952 --> 02:46:10.020]  And so the British Empire eventually did cave over time more and more to these occult, satanic, and secular philosophies, which in my view are really the root of all the problems, right?
[02:46:10.380 --> 02:46:12.581]  I'm not saying the British Empire runs everything, right?
[02:46:12.601 --> 02:46:14.282]  They caved to the Pax Americana.
[02:46:14.921 --> 02:46:23.204]  But it's not by accident that you have all those British spies who co-opted the United States Empire back into that British imperial model.
[02:46:23.244 --> 02:46:24.864]  That's what the Council on Foreign Relations is.
[02:46:24.884 --> 02:46:26.345]  That's what the Trilateral Commission is.
[02:46:26.745 --> 02:46:31.807]  That's what the steering committees are based on, that British imperial model.
[02:46:31.827 --> 02:46:35.568]  And that's what Quigley's whole book is about, especially the Anglo-American establishment.
[02:46:36.188 --> 02:46:53.525]   That's why in the 60s and 70s you had The American establishment at the level of its top thinkers, the Kissingers, the Brzezinskis, right, these people adopting the Malthusian model of the British Empire, which they had had in place for centuries.
[02:46:55.807 --> 02:47:03.831]  And they have that because they have completely abandoned any semblance of Christianity, Orthodox Christianity at all, whatsoever.
[02:47:04.449 --> 02:47:13.977]  In fact, all of that that goes by the name of quote, Anglicanism for the most part in England is really just a front for the British power structure, British intelligence and so forth.
[02:47:14.618 --> 02:47:30.372]  And I wanted to point out that there's just this week reading again, Wall Street and the Bull Street Revolution by Dr. Anthony Sutton, the classic economic text, which gets into who really fostered the Soviet empire, who really got it going.
[02:47:31.175 --> 02:47:53.380]  There's this great page on page 95 where he says that at the time of 1917, right before the Bolsheviks, the British Empire ended up falling to submitting to Lord Milner, part of that Royal Society, Royal Institute for National Affairs, Fabian Circle.
[02:47:54.321 --> 02:47:55.841]  They fell to Fabianism.
[02:47:57.151 --> 02:48:05.981]  Lord Milner, through a couple key placed agents and compromised individuals, was able to convince the Lloyd George government to support the Bolsheviks.
[02:48:06.222 --> 02:48:06.882]  And why was this?
[02:48:06.902 --> 02:48:12.540]   Because it wasn't just Lord Milner, it was also very wealthy people in America, especially
[02:48:12.540 --> 02:48:19.501]   JPMorgan and other front companies and corporations that wanted Russia to fall so that eventually
[02:48:19.501 --> 02:48:23.481]  those corporations could come in and buy it up.
[02:48:23.481 --> 02:48:26.061]  You probably all heard of the John Perkins book, right?
[02:48:26.061 --> 02:48:27.581]  Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[02:48:27.581 --> 02:48:33.201]   That model is just an older model repurposed, right, in a corporate way nowadays.
[02:48:33.201 --> 02:48:37.240]   But back at this time, the corporations and the banks were doing this at the turn of the
[02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:38.342]  century.
[02:48:38.342 --> 02:48:40.261]  And so that was the real reason.
[02:48:40.261 --> 02:48:46.620]   And there's actually the secret agents of Sir Basil Zaharoff, with the knowledge of
[02:48:46.620 --> 02:48:53.242]   Lloyd George, were able to compromise and get the British parliament and governmental
[02:48:53.242 --> 02:48:59.461]   structure to support the Bolsheviks because these elites were Fabian socialists.
[02:48:59.657 --> 02:49:06.820]  And this goes back to Cecil Rhodes and John Ruskin, who wanted to create a Fabian Socialist world government.
[02:49:09.210 --> 02:49:13.671]  This is why it's so important to read Bertrand Russell and to read H.G.
[02:49:13.691 --> 02:49:18.833]  Wells, because they were in the circles of the Fabian Socialists, George Bernard Shaw, all these people.
[02:49:19.553 --> 02:49:22.434]  And some of them, Shaw even talks about Satanism openly, right?
[02:49:22.454 --> 02:49:26.335]  So there are people in these circles who actually were explicitly Satanic.
[02:49:26.355 --> 02:49:39.789]   Whether they're all Satanists, I don't know about that, but many of these elites did have secret society connections, especially Cecil Rhodes created his own personal secret society For this end goal of doing what we're talking about here.
[02:49:40.390 --> 02:49:49.536]  And not only that, I just got in the mail a rare book, which I couldn't believe I got a hold of, but this is the memoirs of a British agent, right?
[02:49:49.556 --> 02:49:50.616]  A famous British spy, R.H.
[02:49:52.498 --> 02:49:53.358]  Bruce Lockhart.
[02:49:53.979 --> 02:50:00.243]  And in his memoirs, he writes about how the Bolshevik Revolution was run by England.
[02:50:01.673 --> 02:50:06.517]  I mean, who propagandized Russia with communism?
[02:50:07.718 --> 02:50:07.898]  Right?
[02:50:08.178 --> 02:50:09.079]  Who was behind this?
[02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:15.204]  Well, a lot of people think, oh, you know, Marx did it and he had the support of Engels.
[02:50:15.244 --> 02:50:16.566]  Yeah, but who was Engels?
[02:50:16.706 --> 02:50:19.508]  Engels was a wealthy British stock owner.
[02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:44.327]   And so there was an explicit desire on the part of Western elites and power structure To foster revolutions, and especially Marxism, Socialism, and Communism in other countries to destroy the existing order, and then they could come in, buy things up, and reorganize everything, and then put future generations into debt, Quigley says, in those countries.
[02:50:44.367 --> 02:50:46.368]  And by the way, it's not just Bolshevism.
[02:50:46.908 --> 02:50:50.570]  The same people, the same money, the same power structure, guess what?
[02:50:50.670 --> 02:50:52.371]  They funded National Socialism as well.
[02:50:53.146 --> 02:50:58.889]  So don't get caught up in the geopolitical false left right and thinking, oh, you know, they funded the elites.
[02:50:58.909 --> 02:50:59.849]  They only fund communists.
[02:50:59.869 --> 02:51:00.930]  No, they fund any of these things.
[02:51:01.470 --> 02:51:01.630]  Right.
[02:51:01.670 --> 02:51:02.291]  And so remember.
[02:51:03.651 --> 02:51:10.915]  What we're going into in this great reset, it does have an occult root in terms of hermeticism, alchemy.
[02:51:12.393 --> 02:51:15.195]  Especially what we read about in, for example, Edmund Spencer's Fairy Queen.
[02:51:15.755 --> 02:51:23.460]  It does have roots in social Darwinism, elements of Hinduism, elements of British Freemasonry play a role in all this.
[02:51:24.520 --> 02:51:31.584]  And the desire is to not just construct a world government, every empire ever has had the goal of a world government.
[02:51:32.165 --> 02:51:41.450]  This is a new kind of world government where the human beings are essentially nodes in a giant battery or a giant computer system.
[02:51:42.315 --> 02:51:48.590]  And you'll be locked into a global brain if you're allowed to live after 90% of everybody else has been killed.
[02:51:49.292 --> 02:51:51.076]  That's the real goal and they all say this.
[02:51:51.872 --> 02:52:04.299]  And it's just amazing to go back into British spy writings and people doing their memoirs and saying, of course, I learned that our own elites was the one supporting the Bolsheviks.
[02:52:04.619 --> 02:52:05.079]  Guess what?
[02:52:05.400 --> 02:52:08.361]  The same thing that McCarthy eventually figures out.
[02:52:08.761 --> 02:52:10.382]  Hey, it's not the people in Moscow.
[02:52:10.462 --> 02:52:15.085]  It's the American wealthy elites that are promoting communism and Sovietism.
[02:52:16.022 --> 02:52:19.124]  And fascism, and all of these horrible systems, right?
[02:52:19.564 --> 02:52:22.346]  It's the wealthiest people that push those things, by design.
[02:52:22.366 --> 02:52:32.712]  If you want to get my books, go to jasonalysis.com and you can get in the shop my new book, my new 600-page book, Essays on Theology and Philosophy, the infamous red book.
[02:52:33.334 --> 02:52:35.536]  All I can tell you is every listener needs one of these.
[02:52:35.656 --> 02:52:36.756]  They'll be sold out soon.
[02:52:36.896 --> 02:52:39.338]  It's incredibly badass technology, so easy to use.
[02:52:39.317 --> 02:52:43.037]   explain to people the free phone and the free satellite uplink system and how
[02:52:43.037 --> 02:52:46.887]  they get it right now while they still can at InfoWarsOffGrid.com.
[02:52:46.887 --> 02:52:50.037]   Well you can get yourself connected in case there's ever a major
[02:52:50.037 --> 02:52:54.147]   disaster and you don't even have to have it connected to the internet or to cellular
[02:52:54.147 --> 02:52:59.047]   service and it will Bluetooth directly to your Bivi device and what it
[02:52:59.047 --> 02:53:03.807]   does is basically they send you a cell phone and a Bivi and it connects to
[02:53:03.807 --> 02:53:09.438]   satellite so this becomes your keypad.
[02:53:07.517 --> 02:53:10.899]  You can send messages directly through the bivy to a satellite.
[02:53:10.939 --> 02:53:16.903]  So in any kind of, you know, disaster or, God forbid, we get hacked like a solar wind hack, you know how that went a while back.
[02:53:16.963 --> 02:53:20.326]  Well, what's exciting is you guys have satellite phones right now, people want them.
[02:53:20.446 --> 02:53:21.727]  NEM4 is offthegrid.com.
[02:53:21.767 --> 02:53:27.851]  But this system takes any system and makes it untraceable, they don't know where you are, and you can send messages.
[02:53:27.790 --> 02:53:49.469]  Because this is the future.
[02:53:50.151 --> 02:53:53.972]  Now I got called last night by Tony Lyons at Skyhorse.
[02:53:54.032 --> 02:53:57.352]  He said we have a very good chance of sending The Great Reset on Amazon to number one.
[02:53:57.392 --> 02:53:59.693]  And if that happens, it'll make the book 20 times bigger.
[02:53:59.773 --> 02:54:00.353]  It's a great book.
[02:54:00.473 --> 02:54:02.153]  It's the blueprint of the New World Order and how to stop them.
[02:54:02.173 --> 02:54:03.213]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:54:03.433 --> 02:54:05.314]  And that would be a major funding boon for us.
[02:54:05.354 --> 02:54:06.754]  So it's like hitting the lottery.
[02:54:06.914 --> 02:54:10.334]  If it goes to number one, no matter what they do, it just magnifies.
[02:54:10.455 --> 02:54:11.735]  It's been as high as number six.
[02:54:11.895 --> 02:54:13.055]  It's number nine today.
[02:54:13.175 --> 02:54:16.816]  It's number one in more than 50 charts in the United States and the world right now.
[02:54:16.836 --> 02:54:18.276]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:54:19.036 --> 02:54:21.337]  Kindle, everything, the book is now shipping as well.
[02:54:21.357 --> 02:54:23.218]  But I want you to get it at Amazon.com.
[02:54:23.278 --> 02:54:25.099]  I want you to buy copies for friends and family.
[02:54:25.159 --> 02:54:29.002]  We can send it to number one today and now is the time to do it.
[02:54:29.082 --> 02:54:31.603]  And you gotta go look at the reviews that are pouring in.
[02:54:31.703 --> 02:54:33.444]  Currently today, it was number nine earlier.
[02:54:33.464 --> 02:54:34.705]  It's number 16 right now.
[02:54:36.366 --> 02:54:41.689]  But you look at it where it's number one in bestsellers in political corruption and misconduct.
[02:54:42.189 --> 02:54:43.830]  And the Kindle's number three.
[02:54:46.092 --> 02:54:48.112]  That's beating free books being put up by Obama.
[02:54:48.433 --> 02:54:51.293]  Best sellers in globalization, number one and number three.
[02:54:53.834 --> 02:54:57.115]  Best sellers in United States history, number one.
[02:54:57.275 --> 02:54:58.315]  Kindle, number six.
[02:54:58.535 --> 02:54:59.295]  And it goes on and on.
[02:54:59.515 --> 02:55:02.536]  You gotta go read the reviews.
[02:55:03.196 --> 02:55:04.676]  Number one in history.
[02:55:05.757 --> 02:55:06.437]  Think they like that?
[02:55:07.077 --> 02:55:08.457]  That's a major message to them.
[02:55:11.318 --> 02:55:12.018]  Number one.
[02:55:13.499 --> 02:55:15.100]  In bestsellers in media studies.
[02:55:15.460 --> 02:55:16.260]  Think they like that?
[02:55:17.881 --> 02:55:20.082]  Bestsellers in corruption and misconduct.
[02:55:20.382 --> 02:55:20.882]  Number one.
[02:55:22.083 --> 02:55:23.564]  Bestsellers in world history.
[02:55:23.624 --> 02:55:24.144]  Number one.
[02:55:24.784 --> 02:55:25.825]  And read the reviews.
[02:55:26.145 --> 02:55:27.725]  People are blown away.
[02:55:28.066 --> 02:55:30.006]  Five stars out the rear end.
[02:55:31.167 --> 02:55:32.828]  Thank you everybody for what you're doing.
[02:55:32.848 --> 02:55:33.728]  We're in this fight together.
[02:55:33.928 --> 02:55:37.550]  And this is a message that humanity wants the blueprint of the Death Star.
[02:55:37.950 --> 02:55:39.751]  Humanity wants to take on the New World Order.
[02:55:41.067 --> 02:55:43.848]  Alex Jones is right about far more than he's wrong about.
[02:55:44.148 --> 02:55:46.349]  He's the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[02:55:46.389 --> 02:55:46.949]  Joe Rogan.
[02:55:48.329 --> 02:55:51.050]  And the quotes from Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson, and others.
[02:55:52.331 --> 02:55:57.992]  If Alex Jones is just a crackpot, why are the most powerful people in the country trying to silence him?
[02:55:59.113 --> 02:56:01.914]  No one bothers to censor the Flat Earthers.
[02:56:01.954 --> 02:56:03.194]  Maybe Alex Jones is onto something.
[02:56:03.514 --> 02:56:05.695]  Read this book and decide for yourself who's crazy.
[02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:08.641]  Get it today at Amazon.com.
[02:56:08.701 --> 02:56:09.742]  Drive it to number one.
[02:56:09.842 --> 02:56:16.687]  If all of you just simply go there and get your Christmas shopping out of the way, and buy five, ten of these books, we'll get three or four dollars a piece.
[02:56:16.787 --> 02:56:19.409]  That'll help keep us on air, and that's what you get as the author.
[02:56:19.429 --> 02:56:23.452]  Get a lot more, buy them at InfoWareStore.com, but I don't want you to get it at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[02:56:23.672 --> 02:56:29.536]  I want you to get it at Amazon.com to send that sucker to number one, and you have the power to do it right now.
[02:56:29.697 --> 02:56:30.637]  Go to Amazon.com.
[02:56:30.657 --> 02:56:33.940]  We'll put a big link in the live show feed, right under the live show video.
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:35.181]  Big Link.
[02:56:35.221 --> 02:56:41.206]  We'll put a whole big story at the very top saying, send The Great Reset and The War of the World to number one with a link to Amazon.
[02:56:41.306 --> 02:56:42.287]  Let's do it now.
[02:56:42.547 --> 02:56:43.628]  You won't fight the traffic.
[02:56:43.668 --> 02:56:44.809]  You won't battle all the crap.
[02:56:45.069 --> 02:56:46.790]  You won't deal with all the Christmas BS.
[02:56:46.850 --> 02:56:53.336]  You just buy 5, 10, 20 copies right now and send this sucker to number one.
[02:56:53.416 --> 02:56:54.237]  Turn it loose.
[02:56:54.497 --> 02:56:55.438]  It's an info war.
[02:56:55.618 --> 02:56:58.280]  This is an exercise of your will and your power.
[02:56:58.500 --> 02:56:59.821]  It's going to number one.
[02:56:59.841 --> 02:57:01.022]  I believe in you.
[02:57:01.283 --> 02:57:02.704]  Go there now and get it.
[02:57:05.785 --> 02:57:07.006]  Oh, no, no, no, I don't even know what this is!
[02:57:07.066 --> 02:57:07.727]  How did you get here?
[02:57:09.068 --> 02:57:11.170]  I just caught you, American!
[02:57:11.470 --> 02:57:13.552]  You visited Bandar Video!
[02:57:14.452 --> 02:57:17.695]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you!
[02:57:18.256 --> 02:57:23.820]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video, or I have to hurt you!
[02:57:24.181 --> 02:57:25.021]  Ah!
[02:57:26.903 --> 02:57:27.624]  Kung-Fu!
[02:57:28.024 --> 02:57:31.247]  It comes from China.
