[00:00.000 --> 00:03.000]  Well, I don't know what will happen now.
[00:03.000 --> 00:06.000]  We've got some difficult days ahead,
[00:06.000 --> 00:09.000]  but I'm not concerned about that now.
[00:09.000 --> 00:13.000]  I just want to do God's will.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain.
[00:17.000 --> 00:20.000]  And I've looked over,
[00:20.000 --> 00:25.000]  and I've seen the promised land.
[00:25.000 --> 00:28.000]  I may not get there with you,
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  but I want you to know tonight
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  that we as a people will get to the promised land.
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  We've got to come together.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  Whether you believe it or not,
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.000]  you've got to decide whether you have dominion over yourself.
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  I believe that the majority of the plain people of the United States
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  will, day in and day out,
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.000]  make sure mistakes in governing themselves.
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  And any smaller class or body of men,
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  no matter what they're creating,
[00:55.000 --> 00:57.000]  will make in trying to govern them.
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.000]  You've got to decide whether it's God that's going to have dominion over you,
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  that you get orders from,
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  or whether some other human that's jacked into the evil force
[01:05.000 --> 01:07.000]  is going to have dominion over you.
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.000]  What we're talking about now is like a second industrial revolution,
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  but the product this time will not be textiles,
[01:15.000 --> 01:18.000]  or machines, or vehicles, or even weapons.
[01:18.000 --> 01:21.000]  The product this time will be humans themselves.
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.000]  Do we want to have a human plan or a post-human plan?
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.000]  Do we want to have a Ferrari and Claus Schwab and Bill Gates
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.000]  say humans are obsolete? We're scum,
[01:29.000 --> 01:31.000]  because they know we are their competition.
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.000]  They know that if we go for what we want,
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  and what God wants to have,
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  they can't compete with that transmission.
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  They can't compete with that blueprint.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  They can't compete without architecture.
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  They can't compete with that master plan.
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  But I just see it now.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  It'll be so clear soon.
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  Are you pro-human or are you anti-human?
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  You are the human resistance to this alien takeover.
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.000]  I don't mean some little tinfoil flying saucer crashing in Roswell
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  from Alpha Centuries.
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.000]  I'm talking about the transmission in the universe
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.000]  of God's order and God's will,
[02:05.000 --> 02:10.000]  or do you choose to serve the agents of death?
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  And like Martin Luther King said,
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  we're not going to judge them off what color they are.
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.000]  We're going to judge them off of the character of their actions and deeds.
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  I'm going to say it right now real clear.
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.000]  I love everybody.
[02:23.000 --> 02:25.000]  No matter what color your beautiful skin is,
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  what I care about your heart and your guts and your mind,
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.000]  and you're under attack by these Satanists,
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  and they want to kill you, and they want to kill your children.
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  And I say we set our differences aside,
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.000]  and I say we come together and we beat these people
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  and we smash their technocracy
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  and we build the future together
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  and we can do anything with our real diversity.
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  These enemies tell us all day about diversity.
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.000]  They mean divided and conquered groups of people
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.000]  separate from each other.
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  This bill is supported by all of the Democrats,
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  House and Senate.
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.000]  It's just the filibuster in a way.
[03:02.000 --> 03:08.000]  So in a way, if you really truly want to honor Dr. King,
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  don't dishonor him by using a congressional custom
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  as an excuse for protecting our democracy.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're from Mayor Trump
[03:20.000 --> 03:21.000]  and you ain't black.
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.000]  I want unity under a code of freedom and liberty and justice
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  and coming together and working together and being strong.
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  And that's what Info Wars is,
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  and that's why the enemies of humanity hate us so much
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  because we love God and God loves humanity.
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.000]  I am a human supremacist.
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.000]  I am a human supremacist.
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  I am a human supremacist.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  I am a human supremacist.
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.000]  I am a human supremacist.
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  That term will be the future war with the robots and the AI.
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  What you're hearing now is the entire future
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  and everything they try to stop us from doing.
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  Our supremacy will not end with this planet.
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.000]  We will keep all the stars. We will colonize.
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  We will green-get worlds.
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  We will go interdimensional.
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  We will unlock the secrets of the universe.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  God has laid them out like Christmas presents for his children.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  And I am extremely honored to be in the fulcrum
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  and the heart of the fight to bring our race,
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  the human race in a race for the future.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  And we will break the enemy.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  We will break the pedophiles.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  We will break the darkness because God already sent
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  his own self down here to show us he could do it.
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  God would never ask us to go through an obstacle course.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  He wouldn't go through.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  And now we're going to go through what Christ did.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  And we're going to go through it.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  And we're going to be destroyed but reborn on the other side.
[05:01.000 --> 05:04.000]  The rage for more than a decade
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.000]  has been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  and so many other ingredients that are known
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  to make us healthy, to make us vibrant,
[05:14.000 --> 05:17.000]  and to defend our immune systems.
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  Now over a year and a half ago, we came out with a product
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  that was top sourced, top of the line,
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  as good as it's going to get.
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  But then the supply chain broke down
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  and it was sold out for more than a year.
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  Finally, green fiber capsules, this big old bottle,
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  in fact, is back in stock for a limited time
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  at infowarstore.com, 30% off.
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  And this limited time left time to go into all the great things
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  it does or what it has in sight.
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  But go to infowarstore.com and look up green fiber capsules
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  for yourself and see how amazing it is.
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  And what's just as amazing is it funds the info war
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  and keeps us on air.
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  We're all under globalist attack.
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  They don't want you to have these essential nutrients
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  that are in this product.
[05:57.000 --> 06:00.000]  Get yours today at 25% off at infowarstore.com.
[06:00.000 --> 06:02.000]  Now back in stock.
[06:35.000 --> 06:38.000]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  you are the resistance.
[06:40.000 --> 06:46.000]  Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  On Thursday, September 8th,
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.000]  for the first time in 70 years,
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.000]  there's a new king of England.
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.000]  Our media says he's our best friend.
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  He's our leader.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  The country was forged in war with his ancestor
[07:03.000 --> 07:09.000]  who declared war on us more than 250 years ago.
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  The 4th of July, all of it, is about our war
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.000]  with that Transylvanian family.
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  And when Prince Charles, now king of England,
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.000]  arrived yesterday to visit the body of his mother
[07:28.000 --> 07:33.000]  with Camilla Parker Bowles.
[07:33.000 --> 07:39.000]  They began to chant, God save the king.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  And here, ladies and gentlemen,
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  is video of your TV viewer of the new king of England
[07:45.000 --> 07:48.000]  who just a year ago declared war on humanity
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  and called for a global military action
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  to cut carbon across the planet
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.000]  that will estimatively kill more than 3 billion people
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  at the cuts that they have projected.
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.000]  Let's roll that audio with the video
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  of the new king of England arriving.
[08:02.000 --> 08:27.000]  They truly discussed his play.
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.000]  There are the lizards creeping out of their vehicle.
[08:39.000 --> 08:45.000]  Their Bentley was in a hearse.
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  God save our king.
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  Our country was born in a war against his predecessor,
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  his ancestor.
[08:54.000 --> 08:57.000]  The House of Windsor is about as English
[08:57.000 --> 09:07.000]  as Japanese sushi.
[09:07.000 --> 09:14.000]  King Charles III, royalty, power and abject,
[09:14.000 --> 09:17.000]  a station before him.
[09:17.000 --> 09:24.000]  God save our king.
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.000]  Truly disgusting.
[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  So his father called for reducing the world population
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  by at least 80% with the deadly virus
[09:37.000 --> 09:44.000]  and of course was a Nazi, but then flipped sides.
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.000]  And now we see our controlled press
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  fawning in sycophantic passion after this.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  There's a man who wants to cut off
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  the world's energy supplies
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  and kill at least 3 billion people.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  That doesn't get over the 80% number,
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  but that's what the main line corporate estimates are.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  If the energy is cut the way they want,
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  half of it by 2030, what it will do.
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  You're already seeing just a slight energy cut
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  and third world collapsing,
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  over 60 million extra starving to death
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.000]  in the last two and a half years, collapsing borders.
[10:16.000 --> 10:21.000]  Here is the king of England less than a year ago
[10:21.000 --> 10:26.000]  declaring war at one of these WEF events
[10:26.000 --> 10:29.000]  on humanity with this massive military corporate
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  financial mobilization he said
[10:31.000 --> 10:34.000]  that will create more money than there is in the world already
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  for him to have this radical transformation
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  off of carbon to the New Dark Age.
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  There is no replacement and they know that.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  Here he is.
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  So, ladies and gentlemen, my plea today is for countries to come together
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.000]  to create the environment that enables every sector of industry
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  to take the action required.
[10:58.000 --> 11:03.000]  We know this will take trillions, not billions of dollars.
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.000]  We also know that countries, many of whom are burdened
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  by growing levels of debt, simply cannot afford to go green.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  Here we need a vast military-style campaign
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  to marshal the strength of the global private sector
[11:20.000 --> 11:26.000]  with trillions at his disposal, far beyond global GDP
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  and, with the greatest respect,
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.000]  beyond even the governments of the world's leaders.
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  It offers the only real prospect
[11:34.000 --> 11:39.000]  of achieving fundamental economic transition.
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  What did CNN say in that secret video that came out earlier this year?
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  They said, after we're done scaring them with COVID,
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.000]  we're going to move to climate change and new climate lockdowns,
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  which equals death, starvation.
[11:52.000 --> 11:53.000]  The burden.
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  We're going to take that burden away from you, my dearly.
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  Him and his good buddy, Jimmy Savelle.
[11:59.000 --> 12:00.000]  So, here we are.
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  That's where we are.
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.000]  And they've tricked a lot of people in the U.K.
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  who've had their nationalism and their culture attacked
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  and shouldn't fly the King George flag.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  You shouldn't do any of that.
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  To think the monarchy is the inculcation
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  and the embodiment of who they are
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  when this is a bloodline
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.000]  since the House of Stewart and Tudor was taken out
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.000]  that is not English at all.
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.000]  In fact, they're not even really Norman,
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  who took over close to a thousand years ago there, the Vikings.
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  So, it's just a total fraud.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  And in World War I, it became a big deal
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  that they were all Eastern European and German,
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  the really Eastern European,
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.000]  and Hungarian, Romanian.
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000]  That's what their lineage goes back to, the dragon.
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  That's why their symbol is not really the lion rampant.
[12:59.000 --> 13:03.000]  Their symbol is not really the unicorn.
[13:03.000 --> 13:06.000]  The original symbol of England obviously is
[13:06.000 --> 13:09.000]  the original King George slaying the dragon.
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  Their banner is the dragon.
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  And that's why when England goes to war
[13:14.000 --> 13:20.000]  and gets rid of any checks and balances or chivalry,
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  when there is no quarter given,
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.000]  it's called flying the dragon flag.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  And the King of England is the sworn enemy
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.000]  of humanity in his own words.
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  So, you think about that and you understand that.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  And when you grovel to these people,
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  you are pissing on America and what this country was founded.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  The new order wants to get rid of America
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  because we're an example to be the opposition to monarchy
[13:48.000 --> 13:49.000]  and the opposition to globalism.
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.000]  And it's been this royal family that's run parliament
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  and that runs the Governor-General of Australia
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  and the rest of the Commonwealth like Canada
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.000]  that has opened the borders up and attacked British culture
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  and Scottish culture and Irish culture
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  and run it into the ground.
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.000]  And they had the feckless communists criticize the monarchy
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  while the monarchy was actually funding communism
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  to take over the world.
[14:16.000 --> 14:17.000]  And people see that and they say,
[14:17.000 --> 14:23.000]  well, we should back the monarchy
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  because the left doesn't like them.
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.000]  Oh, crap.
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  This is the dialectic that they've created.
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  Now, I'm not going to talk much more about these people today.
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  And out of the unsavory lot, I would say Queen Elizabeth II
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  never really said or did anything overtly bad
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  and seemed like an interesting lady.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  But her husband said he wants to kill 80% of us
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  with the deadly virus on record to Reuters
[14:50.000 --> 14:51.000]  and other publications.
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  And her son runs around saying the same thing
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  and is quarterbacking right in the middle of this thing
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  and field marshaling the attack on the world
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.000]  energy supply and food supply.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  It's just outrageous to have this inbred person
[15:05.000 --> 15:10.000]  who at 76 years of age finally got a job
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.000]  lecturing all of us on how the world should operate
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.000]  and what we should do while they cut off pensioners gas allotments
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.000]  this winter, but he lives in giant 400-room palaces.
[15:21.000 --> 15:32.000]  It's just absurdity in oxymoronic hypocrisy scales above
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  the debo script flying in on their own private jets
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  and eating caviar while they lecture you
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  you've got to starve to death and die because of carbon use.
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  It's just all disgusting.
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  It's absolutely in contravention to everything,
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  freedom, and the Renaissance stand for.
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  Infowars.com, Defending Humanity,

[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  World Faces on Precedented Global Hunger Crisis,
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  UN chief says, going into 2023.
[17:10.000 --> 17:14.000]  World Food Program warns of global food catastrophe,
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  looming global catastrophe.
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  The world could run out of food by 2023.

[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  We told you this was a designed program
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  by the globalist two and a half years ago.
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  We told you energy and food prices would explode

[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  to change who we are are only lowering us.
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  They're only making us more depressed.
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  To the end, they're only making us less filled.
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  It is only by going within
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  and really making that connection to God
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.000]  that we can truly empower ourselves.
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.000]  That's why the globalist bombard us with toxins and chemicals
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals

[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  of the New World Order.
[20:05.000 --> 20:09.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:09.000 --> 20:28.000]  A global military campaign with more funding
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  than all the GDP of the world combined.
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.000]  I've got just the money, but all products,
[20:33.000 --> 20:37.000]  all mining, farming, everything.
[20:37.000 --> 20:42.000]  And I'm going to take over with more funds
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.000]  and more production that they control
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.000]  than the entire world already has.
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.000]  The AI robot transhumanist takeover
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.000]  that they've announced.
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  And now they're sabotaging regular civilization
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  and shutting off all the small businesses
[20:58.000 --> 20:59.000]  the German government said.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  There will be no more craft businesses
[21:01.000 --> 21:02.000]  because of energy.
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  There will only be big corporate stores.
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  You'll have to spend money there and buy products there.
[21:07.000 --> 21:10.000]  You'll have to social credit score approval
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  through the universal basic income carbon tax system.
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  This hell isn't coming.
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  This hell is here.
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.000]  And we got some big guests today.
[21:19.000 --> 21:23.000]  Steve Bannon got indicted two days ago
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.000]  for money laundering and a bunch of other BS
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.000]  by the George Soros created and appointed Minion,
[21:29.000 --> 21:33.000]  Leticia James, New York Attorney General.
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  And he turned himself in yesterday
[21:36.000 --> 21:41.000]  and they did a perp walk down the street,
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.000]  passed the cameras, all part of their show trial operation.
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  Steve Bannon joins us.
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  He's bailed out next hour.
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.000]  Then Dr. Andrew Wakefield vindicated one of the first
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  respected research doctors and scientists
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  to document the connection between
[21:57.000 --> 22:02.000]  so-called childhood immunizations and autism.
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  They put out fake reports trying to discredit him.
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  Later it came out a decade later that he was absolutely right.
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  They falsified reports against him.
[22:09.000 --> 22:12.000]  He's going to talk about the train wreck of the New World Order
[22:12.000 --> 22:15.000]  and these new deadly injections and where he sees it all going
[22:15.000 --> 22:18.000]  in the third hour today.
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  But speaking of Steve Bannon, let's go ahead and roll some clips
[22:21.000 --> 22:24.000]  of him turning himself in, then marching him in the building,
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  then marching him back out in front of the cameras.
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  This is just unbelievable.
[22:28.000 --> 22:33.000]  Steve Bannon joins us today.
[22:33.000 --> 22:38.000]  Steve Bannon joins us today.
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  Coming, this is an irony.
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  On the very day the mayor of this city has a delegation down
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  on the border, they're persecuting people here.
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  They're trying to stop on the border.
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  60 days from the day.
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  60 days from the day.
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.000]  Take a step back.
[22:56.000 --> 22:59.000]  60 days from the day.
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  Stop hurting America.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  Stop hurting America.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  Stop hurting America.
[23:05.000 --> 23:09.000]  Stop hurting America, you greasy Christian.
[23:09.000 --> 23:17.000]  Stop hurting America, you greasy, stupid Christian.
[23:17.000 --> 23:22.000]  For every conservative, this is what happens
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.000]  in the last stage of a dying regime.
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  People will never shut me up else,
[23:27.000 --> 23:29.000]  they'll kill me first.
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  I have not yet begun to fight you.
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.160]  That's John Paul Jones,
[23:34.160 --> 23:36.160]  founder of the U.S. Navy,
[23:36.160 --> 23:39.000]  who was fighting King George III,
[23:39.000 --> 23:43.460]  The great great great great great great great great great great great grandfather of King Charles the third
[23:44.460 --> 23:47.720]  When his smaller ship outnumbered three to one was sinking
[23:48.440 --> 23:52.220]  But his trips were boarding his marines were boarding to take over the larger British ship
[23:52.220 --> 23:58.520]  They hailed across on a bullhorn and said surrender now. He said I have only begun to fight
[24:00.360 --> 24:06.440]  And got the quote a little off I have not yet begun to fight it did some very on the quote the point is you get the meaning of it and
[24:06.440 --> 24:08.920]  and
[24:08.920 --> 24:13.840]  This is what they're trying to do. This is what they're trying to push. This is their plan and
[24:16.480 --> 24:18.040]  The same
[24:18.040 --> 24:22.480]  Leticia James is now going after Trump for fundraising and
[24:23.800 --> 24:25.800]  For his post-election fundraising
[24:26.600 --> 24:33.320]  We're just trying to outlaw any of us getting money any of us organizing any of us getting prepared and I looked at the federal indictment
[24:33.320 --> 24:35.320]  that Trump pardoned on but
[24:35.320 --> 24:41.680]  But a year and a half ago or so we covered it on air and he and his staff and crew and the whole organization
[24:42.400 --> 24:49.360]  Got a couple hundred thousand dollars out of tens of millions raised and they built a bunch of wall and drew attention to it. I
[24:51.480 --> 24:55.080]  Mean that they were building a wall on private property on the border
[24:56.320 --> 24:58.200]  Bono kept
[24:58.200 --> 24:59.600]  more
[24:59.600 --> 25:05.080]  Money than anybody ever has with his African project that they put on it to you in he raised billions of dollars with his one
[25:05.080 --> 25:06.080]  project
[25:06.080 --> 25:08.080]  and he was keeping about
[25:09.600 --> 25:15.040]  Half a percent of the money was going to charity was keeping 99 plus percent and so it became a big deal
[25:15.040 --> 25:19.160]  He began to give 1% which made the joke. It truly is now the one
[25:20.160 --> 25:22.160]  Foundation because he gives 1%
[25:23.760 --> 25:31.160]  Raises billions of dollars showing starving African children and keeps 99% for his own evil New World Order ass
[25:31.160 --> 25:37.720]  To hang out with Prince Charles and the rest of them calling for carbon taxes and population reduction
[25:37.720 --> 25:40.440]  And then they scoop up money out the people they're killing
[25:41.520 --> 25:47.360]  The others the Financial Times Bono apologizes for abuses at one charity. So he started giving 1%
[25:48.520 --> 25:50.520]  What a nice man. Oh, but Steve Bannon
[25:51.360 --> 25:58.160]  I think the numbers were they spent about 95% on the project the best charity in America with the best ratings is about
[25:58.160 --> 26:00.520]  87% to charity and that's
[26:02.720 --> 26:08.080]  Salvation Army who I've always supported. I don't know that they're left us and woke and been taken over to or bands
[26:08.080 --> 26:12.520]  It's very very sad. Well, they had record low numbers last year people learn they were funding woke ism
[26:13.520 --> 26:20.200]  But imagine Salvation Army 85% Bannon's deal 95% given to the actual charity Bono 1%
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.360]  And Steve Bannon's the devil, but it gets worse
[26:24.360 --> 26:27.680]  Federal judge just today threw out Trump's
[26:28.960 --> 26:34.520]  Lawsuit against Hillary for election meddling when we know they cooked up lied to Congress about it and created
[26:35.480 --> 26:40.480]  The Russian gate dossier the PP dossier all of that judge says hey, that's not election meddling
[26:40.480 --> 26:46.240]  And that's not defamation to say you're in a room with hookers and they're peeing on you and that that you're a Russian agent
[26:47.600 --> 26:49.600]  You should be put in jail
[26:49.920 --> 26:51.920]  and all the impeachment hearings
[26:51.920 --> 26:56.120]  Judges Mrs. Trump lawsuit after Hillary Clinton over 2016 election
[26:56.640 --> 27:01.840]  Federal Judge in Florida Smith Donald Trump's lawsuit against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saying there was no basis
[27:03.040 --> 27:09.480]  The former president to claim that Clinton and her allies harmed him with an orchestrated planned to spread false information that Trump campaign
[27:10.520 --> 27:12.520]  colluded with Russia
[27:13.160 --> 27:15.160]  For the 2016 race
[27:15.840 --> 27:17.840]  So they have a get out of jail free card
[27:17.840 --> 27:21.240]  Doesn't matter all came out in Congress the Comey lied she lied doesn't matter
[27:21.240 --> 27:27.040]  They have all the witnesses people got indicted over lying about it that they have all the emails where they set it up and planned it and Hillary ran it
[27:28.360 --> 27:32.840]  None of that matters just like Biden two weeks ago said I had nothing to do with the Mar-Lago Ray didn't even know about it
[27:32.840 --> 27:35.360]  Now it came out the federal warrant the judge released it
[27:36.280 --> 27:38.280]  that he directed it
[27:39.240 --> 27:42.800]  Par for the course Biden said yesterday
[27:43.520 --> 27:46.520]  That under his new Green Deal you'll say 500 million dollars
[27:46.520 --> 27:48.520]  A month on your energy bills
[27:48.840 --> 27:51.920]  It's 500 a year, but it'll cost you tens of thousands
[27:52.480 --> 27:54.480]  Everything's a lie with these people

[32:57.920 --> 33:07.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones
[33:07.040 --> 33:16.880]  Live from Austin, Texas
[33:21.560 --> 33:23.560]  Live from Austin, Texas
[33:24.480 --> 33:27.840]  Broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[33:28.280 --> 33:34.160]  All right, Steve Bannon truly a man marked to be a political president by the George Soros controlled judicial system
[33:34.160 --> 33:40.360]  Is joining us for the first 30 minutes of the next hour the Dr. Wakefield will be joining us as well on this Friday edition
[33:41.800 --> 33:47.120]  But I'm very pleased with all this negative news to at least see the awakening accelerating and the fact
[33:47.120 --> 33:49.920]  This is really backfiring and the public is figuring it out
[33:50.120 --> 33:54.920]  There's all these different national polls where uppers of 80% of Americans think the Marlago raid was wrong
[33:55.240 --> 34:00.000]  They've a steep man and stuff is wrong and people are seeing right through this and at the same time
[34:00.000 --> 34:04.320]  Tucker Carlson was covering it last night. I hear a lot of other big national talk show host covering it
[34:04.560 --> 34:07.760]  Members of the UK Parliament are covering it members of Congress are covering it
[34:09.040 --> 34:11.520]  Rand Paul's covering it Johnson's covering it
[34:12.560 --> 34:16.240]  And it's getting a lot of attention in the European Union Parliament as well
[34:16.240 --> 34:23.760]  It's a big news item even in the British Medical Journal saying nine out of ten dying of COVID have been triple jabbed and
[34:25.200 --> 34:27.680]  The vaccine isn't a vaccine is killing people
[34:27.680 --> 34:33.040]  I mean this is admitted now talk about vindication. The reason that's as important is almost no one's taking it now
[34:33.040 --> 34:38.560]  Almost no one's taking the so-called boosters. They're pushing, but they still try to make the military take it
[34:39.200 --> 34:40.720]  They still try to make
[34:40.720 --> 34:44.480]  People that are medical workers take it and it's all of criminal fraud
[34:45.920 --> 34:49.760]  But they built their beach yet and they want to come back with this again and try to make all of us do it
[34:49.760 --> 34:53.920]  So we got to keep hammering it and pushing it, but I got to tell you this is a seven minute club. I'm not going to play at all
[34:53.920 --> 34:56.960]  But this is Romanian member of European Union Parliament
[34:57.520 --> 34:59.520]  Christian Taurus
[34:59.520 --> 35:03.200]  Blast Moderna and AstraZeneca in European Parliament COVID Commission
[35:03.200 --> 35:06.080]  Bombshell revelations made by Moderna and AstraZeneca
[35:06.080 --> 35:10.080]  Now they've been sued having to release the documents in the European Union Parliament COVID Commission
[35:10.080 --> 35:12.080]  for questions asked by
[35:12.720 --> 35:16.320]  This member of Parliament and again lawsuits in the US lawsuits in Europe
[35:16.320 --> 35:20.800]  They've been forced to turn over but most of us blacked out the secret government agreements
[35:20.800 --> 35:28.320]  But Bolsonaro never agreed to it and he then released actually the demands in Brazil
[35:29.440 --> 35:33.280]  And we now learn it's identical the US signed on to it as well Brazil didn't
[35:34.880 --> 35:40.480]  They indemnify and turn over the national parks and military bases to Pfizer and Moderna
[35:41.040 --> 35:45.920]  If there's ever anybody damaged from the shot, so they roll the shot out kill and make a bunch of people sick
[35:45.920 --> 35:51.200]  Then there's lawsuits and then the government's on the tab and the corporations come in and take over
[35:51.840 --> 35:53.840]  IMF World Bank classic
[35:53.840 --> 35:55.840]  Economic hitman tactics
[35:56.400 --> 35:58.400]  So that's what's been done here
[35:58.400 --> 36:03.280]  It's so cold-blooded you go, but they'll go to jail. No they control the Justice Department's
[36:05.360 --> 36:07.360]  They don't have full control of
[36:07.360 --> 36:11.920]  Hungary and places like Romania and places like Brazil and more and more
[36:11.920 --> 36:15.440]  Pro-human parties are getting elected. So we're getting close
[36:15.920 --> 36:17.920]  We're gonna have Trojan horses like Boris Johnson
[36:19.680 --> 36:22.640]  Who will act like he's a patriot but stab us in the back
[36:22.640 --> 36:26.400]  But in the process overall, we're winning as long as we know they're the ones who stable is a
[36:27.040 --> 36:32.640]  destabilizing civilization as long as we understand they're the ones carrying the sound and people get the facts it's game over
[36:33.200 --> 36:37.120]  They want an angry or destabilized world of crime and all the rest of it, but
[36:38.240 --> 36:40.240]  They don't want to be a criminal
[36:40.240 --> 36:43.680]  But they don't want you to know they're the authors of it
[36:44.800 --> 36:49.200]  They think you're stupid, but you're not stupid and this is really backfired on them
[36:49.360 --> 36:51.360]  So they're in a lot of trouble
[36:51.760 --> 36:53.760]  And now it's coming out in the uk
[36:54.240 --> 36:58.560]  In canada in the us in germany in romania
[36:59.040 --> 37:04.320]  Uh, brazil was the first bolsynar. That's why I mean trumps like right here on a scale of one to ten
[37:04.320 --> 37:05.440]  I give him about a seven
[37:05.440 --> 37:11.920]  He means well, but bolsynaro is a ten and a half man like spinal tap. He's an 11. That's why they stabbed him in the stomach
[37:11.920 --> 37:16.960]  But like a eight inch butcher knife. He just he was back on the campaign drill in a week punctured his liver and spleen
[37:17.840 --> 37:21.120]  Uh, and just it's attacking and fighting and that's what we need
[37:21.840 --> 37:27.360]  Like i'm jealous of that the brazilians have bolsynaro. He had a rally with five million people at it this weekend
[37:28.400 --> 37:32.080]  That's leadership. That's what we need. That's the type of thing that's going to save us
[37:32.080 --> 37:38.800]  Is a populist that's smart and supports a real man like bolsynaro. I mean look at that at least five million people
[37:41.360 --> 37:44.320]  Unbelievable all right, we're gonna play part of this
[37:44.960 --> 37:48.960]  Interchange in the parliament and then of the european union and we'll come back
[37:49.440 --> 37:56.160]  With the mass racial attacks taking place everywhere and now joe biden and the entire corporate media is trying to silence it stay with us
[37:56.960 --> 37:58.960]  Mr. Terry, sorry
[37:59.280 --> 38:00.880]  Thank you so much
[38:00.880 --> 38:02.880]  The first set of questions is for both
[38:03.520 --> 38:08.000]  AstraZeneca and moderna. So the first question is I would like to know the date
[38:08.880 --> 38:13.360]  If it's possible when you decoded the full dna sequence of these virus
[38:14.080 --> 38:19.920]  Or you solely relied on the sequence provided to you by the chinese government second question
[38:20.720 --> 38:24.480]  Have you tested if the vaccines are stopping the spread of the virus or not?
[38:24.800 --> 38:29.920]  Because the data clearly shows that your products are not stopping the spread of these virus third question
[38:29.920 --> 38:31.920]  Have you had people who died?
[38:32.960 --> 38:37.920]  During human trials and if so, what were the illnesses that they died from now?
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  I have certain questions for
[38:40.080 --> 38:42.080]  moderna for mr. Boncel
[38:42.960 --> 38:49.920]  You stated here that you relied on the sequence provided to you by the chinese government when you developed your vaccine
[38:50.560 --> 38:52.560]  I have here an answer from Emma
[38:53.120 --> 38:57.040]  Which is showing for every vaccine the kind of tests that were done
[38:57.040 --> 38:59.760]  So in the case of in the case of moderna, for example
[39:00.400 --> 39:07.120]  You provided data showing that you tested these vaccines since 2017 2018 2019
[39:07.840 --> 39:09.840]  So how are you able to test these vaccines?
[39:10.400 --> 39:15.200]  Back then when we found out about these virus in december of 2019
[39:15.760 --> 39:17.760]  second question the contracts
[39:18.320 --> 39:20.320]  You mentioned here that there are some
[39:20.720 --> 39:25.360]  Secrets or some confidential information in these contracts that should protect your interests
[39:25.360 --> 39:30.560]  Now the question that I addressed to you. What about the interests of us and the interests of the european citizens?
[39:31.280 --> 39:33.280]  Because this is how some of the pages
[39:33.680 --> 39:40.640]  From the contract between moderna and the european commission is showing. So i'm asking you. Do you think this is fair to all of us?
[39:41.680 --> 39:47.840]  To talk about these vaccines to talk about boosters to talk about medical products when we don't know the clauses
[39:48.800 --> 39:53.760]  Of these contracts. So the direct question to you mr. Boncel is when are you going?
[39:53.760 --> 39:55.760]  To fully publish
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  The contracts that you had both
[39:58.560 --> 40:02.240]  With the european commission and with the member states of the european union
[40:03.520 --> 40:09.280]  Another question the issue of liabilities. You were asked by our colleague here about the liabilities and you avoided
[40:10.000 --> 40:15.600]  To answer this question. So my question to is why are you pushing the liabilities on the states?
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.400]  And on the people who receive these vaccines and my have and I say I might have
[40:20.400 --> 40:24.080]  Adverse effects. Why you get all the profits?
[40:24.560 --> 40:30.480]  Nevertheless, the bivalent boosters. This is the last question. You already you just stated here
[40:31.280 --> 40:38.960]  That these boosters were requested by the u.s. Government who also approved the boosters without trials on humans
[40:39.600 --> 40:41.760]  So i'm asking you. Do you think this is fair?
[40:42.480 --> 40:48.880]  Do you think we can go and as the european citizens to be vaccinated with some medical products that were not properly tested?
[40:48.880 --> 40:51.600]  Or not at all tested in humans. Thank you
[40:52.240 --> 40:57.840]  Sirius next time I'll deduct 40 seconds from your speaking time and then they go to the ceo
[40:58.560 --> 41:00.400]  That just lies his butt off
[41:00.400 --> 41:03.440]  So there's so many bombshells in that four minutes. I don't know where to begin
[41:03.840 --> 41:07.120]  But you saw the big one that we pointed out first two and a half years ago
[41:07.440 --> 41:09.440]  with dr. Francis Boyle former
[41:09.920 --> 41:13.200]  head us advisor on bio and kim weapons who wrote the us law and
[41:13.200 --> 41:17.920]  And contributed heavily to the u.n. Law and was they had u.n.'s war crime prosecutor kind of a heavy hitter
[41:19.520 --> 41:26.480]  He said look at these documents they go back to 2017 with the same gene sequence and they called it cuba 19
[41:26.720 --> 41:31.760]  They had this damn thing since 2015 chapel hill. It was in the news then under another name
[41:31.920 --> 41:35.840]  They shipped it over there. They produced it. They made it and then in
[41:36.560 --> 41:38.560]  November of 2019
[41:38.560 --> 41:43.280]  Two months before this stuff starts breaking in the news two and a half months. They then announced
[41:44.160 --> 41:50.880]  To the big pharma makers secretly the emails have come out to prepare this gene sequence and start making this vaccine
[41:51.200 --> 41:55.760]  Two mRNA and two virus vector, but they caused the same thing to happen in the body
[41:57.360 --> 41:59.360]  The production of the spike protein
[41:59.600 --> 42:02.480]  So he wasn't the chinese government that gave him the sequence
[42:02.480 --> 42:08.640]  Obama and the new world order made it in north carolina on record shipped it over there when there was a big congressional hearing
[42:08.640 --> 42:13.120]  And they said it was illegal getting a function made it prepared waited till there was a republican
[42:13.120 --> 42:16.320]  They didn't like donald trump and released it and killed a bunch of people
[42:18.640 --> 42:22.480]  And now you wonder why they're cutting your energy off and why they're dissolving the borders and why they're getting rid of
[42:22.480 --> 42:26.800]  The police and why crimes doubled and tripled because they're killing us. They're attacking us
[42:26.800 --> 42:34.400]  We have real live supervillains running things. This isn't a marvel comic movie folks. This is really happening
[42:36.160 --> 42:38.560]  And i'll tell you i'm up here point blank range taking them on

[45:09.440 --> 45:17.120]  I love your products. I am a granny and um for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me
[45:17.280 --> 45:21.280]  I was loaded up the sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called
[45:21.280 --> 45:29.280]  But since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think I'm 55 years old
[45:30.480 --> 45:32.960]  And I was already taking your other supplements
[45:32.960 --> 45:38.320]  But I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[45:38.400 --> 45:41.440]  But when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately
[45:41.520 --> 45:49.680]  But you know over a period of time I started noticing. Okay, you know, this is the ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't
[45:49.680 --> 45:58.240]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore. You know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[46:02.160 --> 46:08.560]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from people say why is it from Chiapas, Mexico the communist
[46:08.800 --> 46:14.800]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil
[46:14.800 --> 46:19.760]  Better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that you know the media calls communist
[46:19.760 --> 46:23.920]  But really they're just a commune and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it
[46:23.920 --> 46:27.920]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[46:27.920 --> 46:30.560]  And I've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up
[46:30.560 --> 46:36.320]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more for pound and I just think it's some of the best coffee
[46:36.320 --> 46:40.960]  You're gonna find anywhere. It's wake up america patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally
[46:41.520 --> 46:43.520]  Um, in fact, I'm gonna tell you a little story
[46:43.520 --> 46:45.520]  Um
[46:46.400 --> 46:51.680]  We had like that. I'm not sure if you want to believe it. Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com
[46:51.760 --> 46:55.440]  And that's how we fund this operation and if you don't fund us, you don't want to share that's fine
[46:55.440 --> 47:06.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[47:36.960 --> 47:40.640]  Almost everybody else gave up almost everybody else sold out
[47:41.680 --> 47:46.640]  Almost everybody else never woke up, but you woke up and you cared and you're engaged
[47:47.520 --> 47:53.360]  I can't tell you everything. I know folks a lot of it is stuff. I can't tell you I'm sworn to secrecy
[47:53.360 --> 47:56.560]  But you better believe we are the american resistance
[47:56.960 --> 48:02.240]  You better believe info wars is recognized as the front line in the fight against the new world order
[48:02.880 --> 48:07.760]  We're outnumbered. We're outgunned, but we have the truth and we have the tide of history
[48:08.560 --> 48:14.000]  On our side and we can and we must and we will prevail and you have my commitment
[48:14.640 --> 48:17.600]  100 to never back down or give up
[48:18.480 --> 48:22.160]  You know, I've talked about this and it should be bigger news because they don't even care
[48:22.160 --> 48:26.400]  The in negotiations with the democratic party lawyers that sued and bankrupted
[48:26.560 --> 48:31.280]  Remington that are running all these shows and you see the big show trials and the rest of it
[48:32.160 --> 48:34.720]  They said just come out against the second amendment. It's all dropped
[48:36.720 --> 48:38.720]  And I said no
[48:39.520 --> 48:43.040]  Not once not twice but three times just come out against the second amendment
[48:44.560 --> 48:48.800]  So then we don't so the judges find us in default. They've got all our records all our stuff
[48:48.800 --> 48:53.200]  Pretend like we never gave it to them default us tell a jury. We're guilty and rig all this stuff
[48:54.160 --> 48:56.160]  And put out total disinfo
[48:58.080 --> 49:01.360]  Look at Steve Bannon indicted look at trump rated
[49:03.360 --> 49:08.960]  This is the real deal folks because they're coming for you. So I'll tell you this right now
[49:11.840 --> 49:17.120]  In the last 50 years, they've gotten almost nothing but new world order operatives into the top brass of the four branches
[49:17.120 --> 49:19.120]  And now the five branches the military
[49:20.480 --> 49:23.600]  That was trumps blind spot. He didn't know that general Flynn tried to explain it to him
[49:25.360 --> 49:28.240]  And there are still a few good people like general Flynn, but in the
[49:29.520 --> 49:31.360]  Non-commissioned area
[49:31.360 --> 49:33.360]  They're almost all good people
[49:33.840 --> 49:35.840]  And they know exactly what's going on
[49:35.840 --> 49:41.200]  Everybody keeps waiting for the military to save you the globalists are preparing the military to come against us
[49:41.920 --> 49:46.160]  And that's why the best people in the military have gotten out because they refuse to run operations
[49:46.160 --> 49:51.360]  They ran against other foreign countries against the american people, but that's what's going on against info wars
[49:52.240 --> 49:54.560]  And yes, there are people embedded in corporations
[49:55.200 --> 49:59.440]  And other areas that are on our side in what you call the deep state, but it's a minority
[50:02.880 --> 50:04.480]  And
[50:04.480 --> 50:07.280]  Obviously the enemy hates our guts because they know we're for real
[50:07.280 --> 50:15.200]  And the enemy knows if what they've done comes out it's game over for their whole system. That's why they're so dangerous
[50:16.880 --> 50:20.640]  But the fools that have joined the new world order and think that they're going to be empowered by it are
[50:21.600 --> 50:22.880]  the biggest
[50:22.880 --> 50:24.880]  useful idiots
[50:25.040 --> 50:27.040]  The planet has ever seen
[50:27.440 --> 50:30.560]  So this is a battle of we the people with word of mouth
[50:31.280 --> 50:35.920]  And human intelligence on the ground to spread the articles the videos the reports the key information we cover here
[50:35.920 --> 50:41.920]  That has seen as ground zero in the best hope of the resistance by good people in major corporations and in government
[50:43.520 --> 50:47.120]  Because they see you as the best hope and this focal point we've created together
[50:48.960 --> 50:51.600]  So I don't like coming to you when we're in this
[50:52.400 --> 50:54.720]  Battle with the globalist and constantly asking for support
[50:55.040 --> 51:01.760]  But there isn't a place doing more or better leading the charge of creating talking points based on the truth to counter the enemy
[51:01.760 --> 51:08.480]  We are the intellectual leaders of the fight and influencing all the major resistance points
[51:09.040 --> 51:11.680]  And I do just as important work when I'm not on air
[51:12.720 --> 51:17.280]  Talking to world leaders talking to top podcasters talking to top talk show host
[51:20.080 --> 51:23.600]  And I send them the information I make sure they get it I challenge them
[51:24.240 --> 51:28.400]  I work around the clock for you and your family because I'm working for myself and my family
[51:28.400 --> 51:32.160]  And we're going to hang together or hang separate as Benjamin Franklin said, but
[51:32.880 --> 51:35.760]  There isn't a better horse in the race to bet on
[51:36.800 --> 51:39.920]  So for all you've been buying products and all you've been spreading the word
[51:40.960 --> 51:42.800]  I salute you and thank you and you're amazing
[51:42.800 --> 51:48.320]  But for those of you that listen, but don't spread the word and those of you that listen and don't buy the products
[51:49.440 --> 51:53.120]  This is your defense. This is the front line of people fighting for you
[51:53.760 --> 51:56.560]  And I need you to win this fight. You need me to win this fight
[51:56.560 --> 52:00.080]  We need each other and I'm asking you now to stop procrastinating
[52:01.520 --> 52:03.920]  And to commit to go to infowarstore.com
[52:05.680 --> 52:10.640]  And buy some of the great products that are there and we usually ship within two days of getting an order
[52:11.600 --> 52:15.520]  We had pre-sell the books for four weeks. The book officially came out a week ago
[52:18.480 --> 52:20.480]  I've signed
[52:20.480 --> 52:26.720]  12,000 books we sold 15,000 signed books 5,000 non-signed we stopped the sign books now
[52:26.800 --> 52:30.240]  10,000 more books came in if you want to get a book the great recent war for the world
[52:30.880 --> 52:32.880]  And infowarstore.com
[52:32.880 --> 52:35.380]  And it supports the broadcast. It's the Death Star plans. It's important
[52:36.320 --> 52:38.320]  but
[52:38.560 --> 52:40.560]  Everybody's books
[52:40.720 --> 52:46.000]  Will be shipped out by next Wednesday. I'm going to come up here this weekend and sign the last 3,000
[52:47.120 --> 52:49.120]  and
[52:49.120 --> 52:54.000]  We needed to make the funds so I did 20,000. I didn't think we'd sell 20,000 signed. Thank you
[52:54.080 --> 52:55.520]  It's a lot of support
[52:55.520 --> 52:57.840]  And we would be again in the red if it wasn't for you
[52:58.480 --> 53:02.880]  But I know some people are pissed off a lot of folks already getting their books because we went back to the first orders five weeks ago
[53:03.280 --> 53:05.280]  we're up to about
[53:05.680 --> 53:09.920]  People that ordered the books about two weeks ago and we've never been two weeks behind on orders
[53:09.920 --> 53:13.840]  but it kind of bottlenecked our whole shipping operation, so I apologize to folks but
[53:13.840 --> 53:19.440]  We're working 24 hours a day with overtime right through next Wednesday
[53:20.400 --> 53:24.000]  To have all of the orders up until about yesterday out

[56:21.840 --> 56:23.040]  But monday will be a big show
[56:23.040 --> 56:26.880]  But we are at the bottom of the next hour after andrew tape leaves us
[56:26.960 --> 56:28.960]  I mean after steve mannan leaves us
[56:29.040 --> 56:34.720]  going to play some excerpts of the andrew tape interview at the bottom of the next hour and
[56:35.440 --> 56:38.320]  This guy is getting billions of views a month
[56:39.040 --> 56:41.520]  on twitter and tiktok and instagram and
[56:41.520 --> 56:48.080]  Absolutely waking up young people by storm. It is amazing. He's the new alex jones
[56:48.640 --> 56:50.640]  When it comes to young people and I love
[56:51.280 --> 56:53.280]  Getting you know replacement troops. I mean
[56:54.480 --> 56:59.040]  I don't want to be the tip of the spear my friend. I want to just win the war against these people. I'm exhausted
[56:59.680 --> 57:03.840]  But everybody I talked to that has high schoolers says all they talk about see andrew tape
[57:04.400 --> 57:06.080]  I remember
[57:06.080 --> 57:08.080]  one time I went to a
[57:08.080 --> 57:12.480]  School event with some friends at a big public school in austin and a middle school
[57:13.040 --> 57:14.640]  And all they were talking about was alex jones
[57:14.640 --> 57:15.680]  I mean even though they didn't know it was me
[57:15.680 --> 57:19.120]  I was wearing a ball cap the kids were running around the halls playing alex jones clips while I was there
[57:19.280 --> 57:23.680]  It's that insane. So you think we're waking adults up. We've had a very special effect on the young people
[57:24.080 --> 57:28.800]  And that's what the enemy really hates. That's what they hate andrew tape. So uh, that's coming up monday
[57:28.800 --> 57:33.120]  But big excerpts of a probably 10 minutes of it or so some of the highlights coming up bottom of the next hour
[57:33.120 --> 57:38.560]  But steve mannan is straight ahead talk about courage talk about a man under fire talk about

[58:06.240 --> 58:08.240]  or a Ferrari
[58:08.560 --> 58:13.280]  It's different strokes for different folks. It varies all through different formulas
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  All three do different things
[58:16.080 --> 58:18.080]  Turbo force is 10 hours of clean
[58:18.720 --> 58:21.760]  Out of control energy. I can't even take a whole pack myself

[1:00:13.460 --> 1:00:18.180]  Until they're under fire and steam management under or fire. They've been president trump or myself
[1:00:18.980 --> 1:00:21.780]  And now leticia james the george soros funded created
[1:00:21.780 --> 1:00:28.900]  A tyrant who swore to get trump and manon has made good on her promise with these newest trumped-up charges
[1:00:29.220 --> 1:00:30.500]  Here he is
[1:00:30.500 --> 1:00:37.060]  Currently being perp walked part of their show trial event in front of the media quoting the founder of the uta navy john paul jones
[1:00:37.060 --> 1:00:39.060]  I have only begun to fight
[1:00:40.580 --> 1:00:42.580]  For every conservative
[1:00:44.340 --> 1:00:47.220]  This is what happens the last days of a diet regime
[1:00:47.220 --> 1:00:53.620]  They will never shut me up. They killed me first. I have not yet begun to fight
[1:00:57.220 --> 1:00:59.700]  Steve man is here with us for 30 minutes. He's a busy man steve
[1:00:59.700 --> 1:01:03.060]  I'm gonna try to just shut up and give you the floor to give us a briefing on what's really going on here
[1:01:04.580 --> 1:01:09.620]  Well, this is just continues on, you know yesterday. They had a 35 person fbi
[1:01:10.260 --> 1:01:13.380]  essentially raid on 35 people regarding j6
[1:01:13.380 --> 1:01:18.500]  Uh everything that they're doing right now alex since they they they've lost in marlago
[1:01:18.980 --> 1:01:25.060]  Right the judge showed them down in marlago. That thing shut down the j6 committee on capitol hill has been a total nothing burger
[1:01:25.940 --> 1:01:28.500]  They understand they're getting the tables run on them
[1:01:29.060 --> 1:01:33.940]  Because of your audience and because of war room posse and all of it that the maga movement
[1:01:34.260 --> 1:01:39.300]  Conservative republicans are showing out in record numbers to blow them out of the house representatives take over the senate
[1:01:39.300 --> 1:01:46.180]  So this is a dying regime. I mean you did the best analysis think anybody on the demonic speech of joe biden in philadelphia
[1:01:46.180 --> 1:01:50.020]  Remember he had a couple of days and Bethesda and scranton to lead up to that
[1:01:50.340 --> 1:01:53.620]  Then he totally demonized our movement and declared war on us
[1:01:53.940 --> 1:01:58.100]  And this is part of that war these things are all been in in in the works and so they declared war
[1:01:58.340 --> 1:02:03.620]  Then they immediately go they obviously can't get to president trump. So they're going to get to alex jones
[1:02:03.620 --> 1:02:06.900]  They're going to get to steve vannon. They're going to get to everybody that's got a platform
[1:02:06.900 --> 1:02:11.620]  They're trying to shut our platforms down and they're trying to stop our voices and why they understand
[1:02:11.620 --> 1:02:15.060]  It's not about alex jones or donald trump or steve banner trucker crawlsson
[1:02:15.460 --> 1:02:20.260]  It's about the people that come to their sites and then get become activists, right?
[1:02:20.500 --> 1:02:25.700]  That's what they want to shut down alex. They're they're maniacally focused on doing it. They're scared
[1:02:26.100 --> 1:02:32.100]  This is the primal scream of a dying regime and we just have to power through it. I tell people don't
[1:02:32.500 --> 1:02:34.580]  Yesterday, you know, don't don't worry about me
[1:02:34.580 --> 1:02:39.060]  Right. Just just and people send their prayers. I love or appreciate pray for our enemies
[1:02:39.540 --> 1:02:42.900]  We're on the offense right now and we're not going to back off and that's why I quoted
[1:02:43.540 --> 1:02:47.060]  My my name one of my two naval heroes everl nelson being the other
[1:02:47.700 --> 1:02:51.780]  But john paul jones, uh, I have not yet begun to fight remember when he said that
[1:02:52.660 --> 1:02:55.460]  it wasn't looking too good
[1:02:55.940 --> 1:03:01.860]  The bollard was basically a flames and about to sink. So uh, he and he wanted the end of the day and took the
[1:03:01.860 --> 1:03:06.740]  British worship. So no alex, you know military history. Uh, you're a warrior your i-court commander
[1:03:06.980 --> 1:03:09.300]  So we're not giving up. We're not backing down an inch
[1:03:10.500 --> 1:03:14.580]  Well, I just want you to be able to get out all the key information here in this 30 minutes
[1:03:14.580 --> 1:03:17.460]  We have because you're absolutely right. People ask how am I taking all these attacks?
[1:03:17.700 --> 1:03:23.460]  And I said, listen, we're all under attack and once you just get that this is an unamerican outside globalist war
[1:03:23.780 --> 1:03:27.860]  Then you just got up like our ancestors did and decided to do the right thing no matter what happens
[1:03:27.860 --> 1:03:33.940]  No, listen, that's why I'm so proud of had you have a show a couple times about the great reset. You walk everybody through
[1:03:34.500 --> 1:03:40.500]  The the the the globalist regime we're up against and these guys is no, it's not even about one election when we win this
[1:03:40.500 --> 1:03:44.340]  November they're not going to sit there and pat you on the head and go. Hey, what a lovely idea
[1:03:44.340 --> 1:03:47.700]  Why don't you guys here's the keys you guys drive it? You take it for a while
[1:03:48.180 --> 1:03:53.860]  Every day is stalling grand. We're going to have to fight the administrative state here and they're in their rogue element
[1:03:53.860 --> 1:03:59.860]  The deep state we're going to have to take down the globalist apparatus to free people from throughout the world everything from the ccp
[1:03:59.860 --> 1:04:04.980]  And Beijing to the world economic forum and all the groups that work with them in concerts or no
[1:04:05.540 --> 1:04:11.540]  There's a there's a war going on. We we understand that and we're winning because we actually have more of the people on our side
[1:04:11.780 --> 1:04:13.780]  But that's why Alex as you know
[1:04:13.780 --> 1:04:16.980]  Either forcing you into bankruptcy putting Steve Bannon in jail
[1:04:17.780 --> 1:04:20.820]  You know prosecuting president trump. It's all part of the same cloth
[1:04:20.820 --> 1:04:22.820]  It certainly is and we're not putting a good face on this
[1:04:22.980 --> 1:04:27.140]  They really are losing all the polls all the numbers not just here, but worldwide show that
[1:04:28.020 --> 1:04:31.700]  Where where's the best place for people to find your show that they're so scared of?
[1:04:32.820 --> 1:04:38.020]  The easiest way is just go to warham.org or you go real america's voice. They're our distributor and producer
[1:04:38.260 --> 1:04:42.820]  So just go to real america's voice. I'll go to warham.org either one you can get the all the shows all the episodes
[1:04:42.820 --> 1:04:46.420]  Well, you say you don't worry about Steve Bannon, but we are going to worry about Steve Bannon
[1:04:46.420 --> 1:04:50.820]  We'll talk about people can support you and so much more. It's ready to have with Steve Bannon back in 60 seconds
[1:04:56.820 --> 1:05:02.980]  People ask me all the time. What is your best new tropic? You've got turbo force. You've got brain force plus
[1:05:03.620 --> 1:05:06.660]  And you've got brain force ultra which one is better?
[1:05:07.380 --> 1:05:09.380]  And that's like asking
[1:05:09.540 --> 1:05:11.540]  What's better a Ford f-150?
[1:05:12.500 --> 1:05:14.500]  Or a Cadillac
[1:05:14.500 --> 1:05:16.500]  Or a Cadillac
[1:05:16.660 --> 1:05:18.660]  Or a Ferrari
[1:05:18.980 --> 1:05:23.700]  It's different strokes for different folks. It varies all three different formulas
[1:05:24.420 --> 1:05:26.260]  All three do different things
[1:05:26.260 --> 1:05:28.260]  Turbo force is 10 hours of clean
[1:05:29.140 --> 1:05:32.100]  Out of control energy. I can't even take a whole pack myself
[1:05:32.820 --> 1:05:40.420]  Brain force plus is a long-term acting clean. Neutropic this brain force ultra is a super fast acting
[1:05:41.220 --> 1:05:43.060]  Neutropic that
[1:05:43.060 --> 1:05:50.420]  Creates incredible clarity, but doesn't last very long. They're all three different formulas and finally back in stock massively discounted
[1:05:50.740 --> 1:05:57.940]  Brain force ultra is available at info wars store.com brain force ultra back in stock info or store.com
[1:05:57.940 --> 1:06:13.460]  Steve Bannon targeted by George Soros in the deep state is our guest ladies and gentlemen
[1:06:13.700 --> 1:06:15.860]  Steve Bannon's attempt to spear. This is the Alex Jones show
[1:06:19.540 --> 1:06:22.100]  And I heard as it were the noise of thunder
[1:06:22.980 --> 1:06:25.620]  One of the four bees say come and see
[1:06:25.620 --> 1:06:30.660]  And I saw and behold a white horse
[1:06:41.380 --> 1:06:49.380]  There's a man going round taking names and he decides who to free and who to blame
[1:06:49.380 --> 1:06:54.420]  Everybody won't be treated all the same
[1:06:56.500 --> 1:06:59.460]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching there
[1:07:02.500 --> 1:07:04.500]  When the man comes around
[1:07:09.140 --> 1:07:15.460]  The hairs on your arm will stand up at the terror in each
[1:07:15.460 --> 1:07:17.460]  In American
[1:07:19.140 --> 1:07:21.140]  Will you
[1:07:26.980 --> 1:07:28.980]  I have not yet begun to fight
[1:07:33.860 --> 1:07:39.620]  We didn't ask to be persecuted, but we knew it was going to happen and I can tell by Steve Bannon's bearing
[1:07:39.620 --> 1:07:47.620]  He's proud to be an American and follow in the footsteps of his ancestors who I know are also American patriots like his father and grandfather and others
[1:07:48.020 --> 1:07:56.020]  And he's here with us up against Leticia James and the rigged courts and George Soros and the Democratic Party and the FBI raids that happened yesterday in the Marlago situation
[1:07:56.020 --> 1:07:58.020]  and all of it. So Steve Bannon
[1:07:58.340 --> 1:08:04.660]  Give us what's happening to you and then the state of America in the world and what you think everybody should be doing right now at this critical juncture
[1:08:04.660 --> 1:08:10.580]  Look, the only way nobody's going to come to save you. Nobody's going to come to save us. We have to do it ourselves
[1:08:11.460 --> 1:08:15.300]  Just like our forefathers had to do this is all this is the American story
[1:08:15.300 --> 1:08:18.900]  This is the lineage of American patriotism right going all the way back
[1:08:19.380 --> 1:08:24.420]  As you know, well Alice to the revolutionary generation. We have to do it ourselves
[1:08:25.060 --> 1:08:30.740]  That's why you know info wars, right? It's been so big and so powerful and so meaningful
[1:08:30.740 --> 1:08:35.940]  It's the reason war room is starting to do it Tucker Carlson. These are platforms. Remember Donald Trump
[1:08:36.180 --> 1:08:40.740]  Donald Trump's instrumentality is if you're in Washington D.C. or New York City
[1:08:41.380 --> 1:08:47.220]  Our Davos not in the room not in the deal in the American working class the middle class have not been in the room
[1:08:47.460 --> 1:08:48.740]  since Ronald Reagan
[1:08:48.740 --> 1:08:51.780]  Donald Trump puts you in the room and he puts you at the head of the table
[1:08:51.940 --> 1:08:56.020]  It's the reason they got to take Trump out. It's the reason for the Marlago raids is the reason for all of it
[1:08:56.020 --> 1:08:57.300]  It's the reason they got to put
[1:08:57.300 --> 1:09:02.580]  Alex Jones out remember Alex Jones are trying to put in a bankruptcy right now multiple cases things all over the country
[1:09:02.580 --> 1:09:04.580]  But that's just the first they're doing all this stuff to Alex Jones
[1:09:04.580 --> 1:09:07.620]  We even know about right and that he came and talk about right now
[1:09:08.020 --> 1:09:09.620]  But it's the same with me
[1:09:09.620 --> 1:09:12.340]  But it's if you give up and surrender and stop
[1:09:12.820 --> 1:09:14.820]  Right, you could always go do something else
[1:09:15.140 --> 1:09:20.980]  But that's the definition of a patriot remember Alex in the in the revolutionary generation only about a third
[1:09:21.620 --> 1:09:26.340]  Of the nation were on the patriot side a third of the nation were hard courtories and about a third were in the middle
[1:09:26.340 --> 1:09:31.300]  Like every revolution you see or every they're going to play both sides and they're going to go to the winner
[1:09:31.860 --> 1:09:37.780]  Right now you're actually seeing and this is why leticia james and and in the justice department the fbi and the
[1:09:38.020 --> 1:09:39.460]  by-demonstration and crazier
[1:09:39.460 --> 1:09:45.540]  They see the shifting nature of this populous inclusive nationalism and participatory popular populism
[1:09:45.940 --> 1:09:48.660]  They can do the math. They're very smart and cunning people
[1:09:48.820 --> 1:09:52.580]  They understand in the great state of texas in south texas in the rear grand valley
[1:09:52.820 --> 1:09:55.220]  We're going to get now 50 percent of the hispanic vote
[1:09:55.220 --> 1:10:02.180]  Right they understand that african-american men more than ever are starting to come to the mager cause right they see the other day
[1:10:02.260 --> 1:10:03.060]  this uh
[1:10:03.060 --> 1:10:08.340]  The school board in uh, I think it was miami day county voted eight to one because of pressure in the parents not to have
[1:10:08.900 --> 1:10:13.780]  Gay pride month in october where they can use that to groom their children. That's the hispanic community
[1:10:14.020 --> 1:10:16.420]  We're winning. We're two-thirds of the nation right now
[1:10:16.580 --> 1:10:21.380]  We just have to get our message out more and get our voices out more and get our votes out more
[1:10:21.380 --> 1:10:26.660]  Why are they trying to shut down war? Why are they trying to not just put alex jones in bankruptcy?
[1:10:26.660 --> 1:10:29.540]  Why are they trying to liquidate everything around alex jones?
[1:10:29.780 --> 1:10:36.740]  They understand the more that you have out there with uh with info wars and particularly things like the great reset book
[1:10:36.740 --> 1:10:41.460]  Where people can read it people that have never heard of alex jones's name or if they heard it hating and they read it
[1:10:41.460 --> 1:10:44.820]  They go wow this guy was saying this 20 and 30 years ago
[1:10:45.060 --> 1:10:50.180]  This guy's actually been connecting dots not just on transhumanism, but this kind of global apparatus
[1:10:50.180 --> 1:10:54.020]  This is not actually a conspiracy theory. This is actually something that's real
[1:10:54.260 --> 1:11:00.980]  That's what they want to stop and if we sit there and ever blink if we ever back up an inch if we ever show any fear
[1:11:01.540 --> 1:11:06.100]  We lose and so remember we don't have the ability to we don't have to the
[1:11:07.380 --> 1:11:09.380]  We don't have the option of having mistakes
[1:11:09.940 --> 1:11:16.340]  Everything we have to do is be spot on and hammer every day and that's why look all the prayers of people around the nation
[1:11:16.340 --> 1:11:22.100]  I really appreciate I had so many uh, you know people saying they're praying for me and it's so powerful and the power of prayer
[1:11:22.100 --> 1:11:24.740]  Is everything but pray for our enemies, okay?
[1:11:25.060 --> 1:11:30.500]  Because now we're coming for and we're going to blow them at the ballot box and that's just the start remember
[1:11:31.540 --> 1:11:34.580]  People who think it's tough times now. You think we've gone through hard times
[1:11:35.060 --> 1:11:39.780]  We've got 10 or 20 years of this this is a fourth turning and it's not going to end on november 8th
[1:11:39.780 --> 1:11:44.580]  Just like it didn't end back in december of 16. You can't be that naive you have to understand
[1:11:44.580 --> 1:11:48.580]  We're at it's a subtitle your book says alex. It's a war for the world
[1:11:49.140 --> 1:11:52.660]  It's a war war for the entire world. This is really the third world war
[1:11:52.980 --> 1:11:56.020]  Okay, this is not going to be fought with bullets tanks and guns
[1:11:56.340 --> 1:11:59.380]  At least not now the kinetic part of this may get to be later
[1:11:59.620 --> 1:12:04.500]  Right as as the forces of oppression come against us because we're winning right now. That's what I tell everybody
[1:12:04.820 --> 1:12:07.540]  It's all about your agency. It's all about your action
[1:12:07.860 --> 1:12:11.780]  It's all about your focus and we don't need everybody if this is too much for you
[1:12:11.780 --> 1:12:14.580]  And I say this people all the time is this is too hard and too tough. That's fine
[1:12:14.820 --> 1:12:19.380]  That's fine to stay off to the side until you see us start to win and then jump back on board
[1:12:19.380 --> 1:12:24.820]  But for those that are patriots those that sit there and go hey if this is the revolutionary war out have been at saratoga
[1:12:24.980 --> 1:12:29.540]  If this is a revolutionary war out have been at trendy if this is a revolutionary war out have been at valley forge
[1:12:29.700 --> 1:12:34.420]  Well, this is your revolutionary war right here and right now and now's the time to sign up
[1:12:34.660 --> 1:12:37.780]  And what do you do? You become a force the first time you become a force multiplier
[1:12:37.780 --> 1:12:42.820]  Just become a force multiplier do that first use your agency and we're going to win this
[1:12:42.820 --> 1:12:45.460]  We know we're on the side. We know on the side of the righteous
[1:12:45.700 --> 1:12:49.940]  We know we have the issues on our side that they ever come in and debate alex jones and the issues
[1:12:49.940 --> 1:12:52.660]  Have you ever heard any guy come and really debate alex jones the issue?
[1:12:53.380 --> 1:12:53.940]  No
[1:12:53.940 --> 1:12:58.980]  He's conspiracy theorist. We got a bankrupt him. We got liquidate the company. We got throwing him off all media
[1:12:59.060 --> 1:13:01.380]  Does anybody ever come and try to they're going to debate Steve Bannon?
[1:13:01.380 --> 1:13:04.340]  I've debated the top guys in the world all over the world and crushed him every time
[1:13:04.340 --> 1:13:08.100]  They're going to sit there and debate right bernard levy of
[1:13:08.740 --> 1:13:13.620]  From from up in canada and toronto levy bernard levy and the athens
[1:13:13.780 --> 1:13:16.500]  I blow these guys off the stage. They're not going to debate us alex
[1:13:16.660 --> 1:13:23.620]  What they're going to try to do is not just the platformers is now either imprison you or push your total liquidation bankruptcy
[1:13:24.420 --> 1:13:27.860]  And steve before you went on live. You said I don't want to talk about myself
[1:13:27.940 --> 1:13:31.380]  I want to talk about everybody but I I differ in that one area
[1:13:31.380 --> 1:13:39.140]  You're a champion for liberty. You were the main brain trust with trump that that really got a lot of the great gains of freedom and liberty and
[1:13:39.780 --> 1:13:44.260]  Anti-globalism in that first few years where they distracted trump with the russia gates stuff
[1:13:44.260 --> 1:13:50.980]  And they see you like the romans would have a standard that was their was their logo was was was you know their symbol of victory
[1:13:51.220 --> 1:13:53.540]  And if the enemy could capture that that was a big victory
[1:13:53.780 --> 1:13:56.980]  There's some famous cases of the germans, you know capturing one an old war starting
[1:13:56.980 --> 1:14:02.740]  They see you as like a roman eagle standard that they want to get and it's a rallying point
[1:14:02.900 --> 1:14:05.860]  They can get you they can get us all so we need to stand with you
[1:14:06.260 --> 1:14:10.740]  We need to support you we need to back you because I know they've been trying to run you to ground like us
[1:14:10.820 --> 1:14:14.420]  How do we support the war room? How do we support one of our main champions?
[1:14:15.380 --> 1:14:17.540]  I think look it's very very simple for your audience
[1:14:17.540 --> 1:14:22.980]  So just go to worham.org or go to rumble or go to real america's voice any of our distribution partners and just
[1:14:22.980 --> 1:14:28.340]  Watch the server all all we ask is that you it's all free and sure we don't have any paywall anything at all
[1:14:28.500 --> 1:14:34.100]  Just share all we want to share listen one of the things I find most powerful as I see alex jones's content everywhere
[1:14:34.340 --> 1:14:36.340]  And different things that means we're winning
[1:14:36.500 --> 1:14:42.180]  They can't shut it down because they can't stop this content and they understand that the more people that see the content
[1:14:42.340 --> 1:14:46.740]  Look, they've taken out shone's off of everything and your content's still out there bigger than ever
[1:14:46.900 --> 1:14:51.860]  They try to shut war room down of everything youtube and in facebook and in twitter and all of it
[1:14:51.860 --> 1:14:57.140]  And we're bigger than ever because why the audience is sharing it because people and we're going to break one more segment
[1:14:57.140 --> 1:15:02.340]  I want to just show some video for tv viewers radio listeners go to the war room on your site and see it great video
[1:15:02.660 --> 1:15:04.660]  people put together with the
[1:15:05.380 --> 1:15:07.380]  man comes around
[1:15:07.380 --> 1:15:10.660]  Your song johnny cash, but the way you looked in that courtroom
[1:15:11.460 --> 1:15:16.180]  Just absolutely looked energized and not even defiant, but I just it's an image of victory
[1:15:16.420 --> 1:15:18.900]  And and and instead of being defeated at that point
[1:15:18.900 --> 1:15:22.660]  I I just see a man that knows he's where he was supposed to be where he wanted to be
[1:15:22.660 --> 1:15:26.100]  Can you speak for 30 seconds on how you were feeling in that kangaroo court?
[1:15:27.060 --> 1:15:29.060]  Very powerful. It was one of the best days of my life
[1:15:29.460 --> 1:15:32.180]  I tell you I had a chance to visit with some of the officers and stuff
[1:15:32.420 --> 1:15:36.660]  There's so many maga people. There's so many people that are afraid they have to be because of their jobs
[1:15:36.980 --> 1:15:43.060]  We're winning the people behind the scenes support us. Trust me. This is this is that we are winning
[1:15:43.380 --> 1:15:47.060]  That's what I was saying. We have two-thirds the american people in back. Well, see I'm gonna say this right now
[1:15:47.060 --> 1:15:51.140]  I'm gonna put a t-shirt out with that face that that look is just victory
[1:15:51.300 --> 1:15:55.860]  I'm gonna paint a whole wall in our office with you on it because that look just just just
[1:15:56.660 --> 1:15:58.500]  It's victory. We'll be right back

[1:20:41.060 --> 1:20:43.620]  Terony and we'll just go away or it'll intimidate others
[1:20:44.020 --> 1:20:48.500]  This is our chance to shine and measure up to our amazing ancestor steepman
[1:20:48.500 --> 1:20:50.980]  And you are always on fire, but you're particularly on fire
[1:20:51.380 --> 1:20:54.740]  And I just admire the incredible work you're doing in the closing eight minutes
[1:20:54.740 --> 1:20:58.740]  We have left before you've got to go. Please continue to give everybody their marching orders
[1:20:59.460 --> 1:21:04.420]  Well, the one that marching remember yesterday the irony was when I was in new york city about the wall
[1:21:04.980 --> 1:21:09.460]  Uh, mayor adams had a delegation down. Remember, he's made it a sanctuary city
[1:21:09.780 --> 1:21:15.620]  So they're being inundated right now with illegal aliens or unauthorized and ununapproved
[1:21:16.100 --> 1:21:20.660]  Uh, you know personages that are here and we've had 4.9 million
[1:21:20.660 --> 1:21:25.540]  in the first 18 months of the biden regime the new york times even reports
[1:21:25.540 --> 1:21:30.580]  There's a million in the asylum program that won't even be dealt with for an average of five to seven years
[1:21:30.820 --> 1:21:34.580]  And they're going to live here with all these benefits adams sent a delegation down
[1:21:34.580 --> 1:21:36.980]  They find out about the border the mayor of dc
[1:21:37.460 --> 1:21:43.300]  Because the national guard won't come out is declaring a state of emergency in dc because of being inundated about this, right?
[1:21:43.700 --> 1:21:48.340]  So what they're one of the things that drives them crazy is as yes, this was a civilian movement
[1:21:48.340 --> 1:21:51.780]  We understood we couldn't build the whole wall, but this was symbolically to help
[1:21:52.100 --> 1:21:58.580]  Trump when Nancy Pelosi first took over a speaker of the house and shut down any ability of the trump administration to build the wall
[1:21:58.740 --> 1:22:06.100]  And we bought if you saw the movie, uh, I think it's sacchario about el paso and war as that's exactly where we built that first amazing mile
[1:22:06.420 --> 1:22:10.740]  Of wall for those who don't know I know the delta force guys that were involved that movie sacchario is a true story
[1:22:11.460 --> 1:22:14.980]  It's a true story. By the way, everybody should watch it. Do you want to see what we did on the wall?
[1:22:14.980 --> 1:22:21.140]  We built right at the number one place with a human traffic when they drug traffic coming from war is in el paso
[1:22:21.380 --> 1:22:26.180]  Up the side of that mountain is where we built the wall and we built it in four days over memorial day
[1:22:26.340 --> 1:22:29.780]  This is what drove them crazy. They tried to shut it down. They couldn't remember
[1:22:30.020 --> 1:22:34.660]  If you believe in the sovereignty of your nation if you will fight for the sovereignty of your nation
[1:22:34.980 --> 1:22:38.340]  They are out to destroy you and that's why the people at the tip of the spear
[1:22:38.500 --> 1:22:42.820]  They're going to try to destroy as symbols to scare you off, but it's you they're coming for
[1:22:42.820 --> 1:22:46.740]  They want to either have you arrested or take all your money or
[1:22:47.620 --> 1:22:51.140]  Psychologically, have you just surrender and say, you know what? I'm going to go play golf
[1:22:51.300 --> 1:22:53.780]  I'm just going to hang out at the beach if you do that
[1:22:54.580 --> 1:22:58.740]  The country is over. There's no doubt. This is not about like I said Tucker Carlson
[1:23:00.260 --> 1:23:04.660]  You know Steve Bannon, uh, Donald Trump or alex jones. This is about you. This is a populist movement
[1:23:04.660 --> 1:23:09.860]  This is a inclusive nationalist movement. They understand throughout the world. You're seeing happening in idly right now with george
[1:23:09.860 --> 1:23:15.060]  You have maloney. You're seeing it happen in this sunday in in in sweden with the swedish democrats
[1:23:15.540 --> 1:23:17.940]  Greta sunberg. They had Greta sunberg out today
[1:23:18.420 --> 1:23:20.420]  campaigning on this ridiculous
[1:23:20.660 --> 1:23:25.620]  Transition of green energy which is supposed to bankrupt us all and that's why I think as a framing device
[1:23:25.700 --> 1:23:29.940]  I'm so proud the great reset. You've got it. If you understand. Hey, how did this all come about?
[1:23:30.100 --> 1:23:33.380]  What is this great war for the world? That's why alex?
[1:23:33.380 --> 1:23:38.820]  I think your book is fantastic as a primer to get everybody up to speed to then understand
[1:23:38.820 --> 1:23:43.300]  We must win and we must win at the ballot box. We can do that in november 8th
[1:23:43.300 --> 1:23:46.740]  But that's just the start like I said, this is a 20 10 or 20 year project
[1:23:46.900 --> 1:23:51.860]  It took us 50 or 60 years to get here is going to take us 20 years to get out. I told you
[1:23:52.580 --> 1:23:55.700]  I totally agree and since you mentioned the great reset in the war for the world that you champion
[1:23:56.020 --> 1:23:59.460]  And I really appreciate you reading it. It's mainly it was easy to write. It's their quotes
[1:23:59.460 --> 1:24:04.980]  It's their battle plan. What if people would have read mind comp that hitler wrote everything he said in the book
[1:24:04.980 --> 1:24:10.740]  He did. Well, this is their mind comp. So this is their admissions right here. This is their confessions
[1:24:10.900 --> 1:24:12.900]  That's why I called the blueprint of the death star
[1:24:13.860 --> 1:24:15.620]  No, listen, here's the beauty of the book
[1:24:15.620 --> 1:24:18.500]  You actually quote them at length you take a couple of the top books
[1:24:18.740 --> 1:24:22.980]  You take a couple of the top thinkers you tie it all together and this is what people have to understand
[1:24:23.300 --> 1:24:29.780]  Look once you read this you understand what we're up against. Okay, you'll understand exactly what this apparatus
[1:24:29.780 --> 1:24:34.980]  You know what Alex calls it the death star, but you understand what we're up against and we're not going to back off this
[1:24:34.980 --> 1:24:35.780]  We can't back off it
[1:24:35.780 --> 1:24:40.900]  The united states is actually the centerpiece of this battle because they understand just like in the revolutionary war
[1:24:41.060 --> 1:24:44.180]  If they can take the liberty and freedom of american citizens
[1:24:44.420 --> 1:24:47.860]  They can take it anywhere and that's why you have to fight back and by the way, alex
[1:24:47.860 --> 1:24:51.380]  I'm not just read it. I tell everybody get a pin. I always get my great pens here
[1:24:51.540 --> 1:24:56.260]  I had my pen and I'm underlining everything and here's the beauty of it. You footnote everything
[1:24:56.260 --> 1:25:00.980]  This is not alex jones's opinions. What alex jones's team has done is pull it all together
[1:25:01.220 --> 1:25:05.700]  It's all reference right there. You can go to a footnote. I know you've got an online site about it, too
[1:25:05.700 --> 1:25:09.220]  That's what I think tony lions and the guys at sky horse did such a great job
[1:25:09.300 --> 1:25:15.380]  But listen once you read this book you understand why the alex jones's and the steve bannons are not going to back off
[1:25:15.460 --> 1:25:18.100]  There's all kind of other things we could do is all kind of other things
[1:25:18.340 --> 1:25:20.660]  Trump could do is all kind of things tucker carlson could do
[1:25:20.900 --> 1:25:24.580]  We're all in this fight and we're never going to back off one inch and we don't care
[1:25:24.580 --> 1:25:30.900]  What they try to do is I told him yesterday. Hey, they they and I know you've been swatted all the time alex and never talk about people
[1:25:30.900 --> 1:25:37.380]  Don't understand the pressure that alex jones and others like him are under behind the scenes. He's been swatted so many times
[1:25:37.540 --> 1:25:43.780]  I get swatted with four times in what 10 days two weeks a couple of weeks and those assert they're trying to kill you by cop
[1:25:43.860 --> 1:25:46.260]  It's not the police's fault the police are coming there to do their job
[1:25:46.420 --> 1:25:49.700]  But they want to make you one false move marjorie tale of green as you know
[1:25:49.700 --> 1:25:55.060]  She sleeps with an ar-15 in her bedroom if she had come the first night to that door like she normally would have
[1:25:55.140 --> 1:25:59.620]  See here's noise outside and had her ar-15 out marjorie tale of green be done
[1:25:59.780 --> 1:26:04.500]  They they they did a done industrial right there. She'd be grave. You're dead. Okay. That's what they're trying to do
[1:26:04.500 --> 1:26:08.900]  They're trying to assassinate you. They're trying to bankrupt you. They're trying to liquidate you
[1:26:09.060 --> 1:26:13.860]  They're trying to imprison you and hey if you ever show any fear of your show. Oh my gosh
[1:26:14.260 --> 1:26:18.580]  They are going to run the table. So now's our revolutionary generation moment
[1:26:18.580 --> 1:26:22.580]  Let's make those men and women proud of us those men and women that actually
[1:26:23.300 --> 1:26:29.700]  Fought off the greatest empire of the world at the time for the freedom of this country and pass it down for what 14 generations
[1:26:30.100 --> 1:26:32.340]  Okay, now it's our time to stand up. This is our moment. That's right
[1:26:32.340 --> 1:26:35.860]  It's historic crossroads and if you start in the new world order of the globalist
[1:26:35.940 --> 1:26:41.380]  It's much worse to submit to them. So there's really no choice but to fight that but you call yesterday the best day of your life
[1:26:41.780 --> 1:26:43.140]  You just
[1:26:43.140 --> 1:26:49.940]  Extremely iconic Al Pacino couldn't you know radiate that much charisma or confidence and you're a confident guy
[1:26:49.940 --> 1:26:52.580]  But you're not normally being you know arrogant displaying your will
[1:26:52.820 --> 1:26:57.780]  What was happening in that courtroom because I'll just say it you look extremely energized and powerful right there
[1:26:58.900 --> 1:27:03.140]  I just think you look I I'm a big believer in the Holy Spirit. It was that that was a very spiritual
[1:27:03.700 --> 1:27:09.140]  Moment the whole day was for me just very calm and collected and very focused understand. Hey, we're over the target now
[1:27:09.140 --> 1:27:12.740]  We're never going to back off this way never going to back off. This is what they're trying to do for president
[1:27:12.740 --> 1:27:15.220]  Trump remember what they did yesterday and Alex is right
[1:27:15.220 --> 1:27:16.660]  They want to get the guys around it
[1:27:16.660 --> 1:27:20.660]  Right and they particularly want to get the guys that have platforms around it because they want to choke him off
[1:27:21.620 --> 1:27:25.780]  Listen marlago failed. They're not going to win on appeal marlago thing is done
[1:27:26.100 --> 1:27:31.620]  Okay, that's why they sent 35 FBI guys out yesterday to start to roll up other people for another grand jury
[1:27:31.860 --> 1:27:35.940]  They are they're demonic right now. Just go back and watch biden's speech
[1:27:36.340 --> 1:27:40.980]  What is that? That is the most disgraceful speech Alex as you've said in the history of this country and the
[1:27:40.980 --> 1:27:47.220]  To perform a sacrilege and really where the declaration of independence was most drafted and negotiated
[1:27:48.020 --> 1:27:50.020]  He was pissing on 1776
[1:27:50.820 --> 1:27:54.260]  Right there in front of the whole nation with that demonic red a discrepancy
[1:27:56.020 --> 1:28:00.420]  All signals to his buddies on a global basis right to take to bathe
[1:28:00.980 --> 1:28:07.540]  The greatest sanctuary of liberty independence hall with the constitution and the declaration on the greatest nation of freedom in the world
[1:28:07.540 --> 1:28:13.460]  They're freed more people than anybody in the world to bathe that in that blood red a disgrace and we're never backing down on that demon
[1:28:14.020 --> 1:28:16.500]  And then his speech was where the enemy he did it again yesterday
[1:28:16.740 --> 1:28:21.060]  He said republican voters and trump voters are the enemy and are terrorist
[1:28:21.220 --> 1:28:24.740]  I'm really concerned. We're out of time with false flags in the next 60 days for the election

[1:32:59.300 --> 1:33:05.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:33:05.300 --> 1:33:19.860]  Live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[1:33:31.220 --> 1:33:33.220]  All right, dr. Andrew wakefield
[1:33:33.220 --> 1:33:40.420]  Is the most prominent scientist and medical researcher to first expose vaccines and their connection to all these health problems
[1:33:41.220 --> 1:33:46.180]  Decades ago and he got destroyed but rebuilt because the truth came out. They'd rigged everything against him
[1:33:47.380 --> 1:33:49.060]  So that's coming up in studio next hour
[1:33:49.060 --> 1:33:50.820]  But look at this image
[1:33:50.820 --> 1:33:57.220]  Of steve bannon when he is in there being set up for money laundering all this crap with his charity giving 95 percent to actually build the wall
[1:33:57.380 --> 1:34:00.340]  Oh my god, the charity took five percent how evil bono takes
[1:34:00.340 --> 1:34:05.860]  99 percent and gives one percent. I mean, it's just ridiculous that this has gone on
[1:34:06.100 --> 1:34:07.940]  But that's what's happening
[1:34:07.940 --> 1:34:13.940]  But and rotate we did a big interview yesterday where it's going to air on monday like a documentary of a bunch of clips and
[1:34:14.340 --> 1:34:16.340]  Added fact-toids and information
[1:34:16.580 --> 1:34:20.660]  It's going to be a big interview. He's the most google guy in the world and i've known him for many many years
[1:34:21.060 --> 1:34:26.180]  He's hosted the show. He's come to austin. I know him and his brother well paul watches really good friends with him and
[1:34:26.180 --> 1:34:30.580]  They're scared of him and they're lying about who he is. I want to play these clips
[1:34:31.460 --> 1:34:34.420]  We got four different clips. We're going to play these back-to-back
[1:34:34.900 --> 1:34:38.660]  Here's some of the excerpts of the hour-long interview that's going to drop live on the show
[1:34:40.100 --> 1:34:43.940]  Monday, but take these clips and share them everywhere. Everything we have is copyright free
[1:34:45.380 --> 1:34:46.740]  free to air
[1:34:46.740 --> 1:34:51.300]  Take these clips and get them out of the world because andretates the most school guy in the world
[1:34:51.300 --> 1:34:58.580]  As information is liberating and is empowering and we can get folks to come to info wars by promoting this and we got a lot
[1:34:58.580 --> 1:35:00.580]  Of great stuff with andretate
[1:35:01.140 --> 1:35:04.100]  That's coming up. Let's just say this. We're going to join forces
[1:35:04.980 --> 1:35:07.940]  In the near future and i'm going to leave it at that. You'll hear about the next few weeks
[1:35:08.420 --> 1:35:13.620]  Uh, but it's on like donkey kong. So we'll play these clips. I'll hit a bunch of other big breaking news
[1:35:14.180 --> 1:35:17.060]  Here on this live friday edition, but here are some
[1:35:17.700 --> 1:35:19.700]  Preludes here are some hors d'oeuvres
[1:35:19.700 --> 1:35:23.460]  Uh, here is kind of the pre-show of what's coming up on monday
[1:35:24.020 --> 1:35:29.300]  I'm really concerned about false flags ahead of the midterms. Uh, we already see them cutting the power off all over the world
[1:35:29.620 --> 1:35:31.060]  They said we're going to
[1:35:31.060 --> 1:35:36.580]  Go big with environmentalism and power outages in the undercover video from project veritas about eight months ago
[1:35:36.660 --> 1:35:38.660]  We now see that happening
[1:35:39.140 --> 1:35:42.500]  How do you see these these these control freaks striking back?
[1:35:43.860 --> 1:35:48.420]  Well, this is what's scary is because power and energy is the absolute base for any country on the planet
[1:35:48.420 --> 1:35:52.340]  If you don't have energy or power you have nothing else. You don't have security. You don't have safety
[1:35:52.340 --> 1:35:54.980]  You don't have food production. You don't have absolutely anything
[1:35:55.220 --> 1:36:01.620]  So they're going down to the very very core and very very crux of humanity now once power outages start becoming a mainstream thing
[1:36:01.780 --> 1:36:07.460]  It's not just about not being able to turn on your television. It's about crime. It's about people dying on the street
[1:36:07.700 --> 1:36:14.980]  It's about emergency services. It's about food production. It's about so many more important things and it's it's truly evil
[1:36:14.980 --> 1:36:20.820]  But when you get insulated like these people are at the level they're at completely insulated from the consequences of their own actions
[1:36:21.060 --> 1:36:26.260]  They're prepared to sacrifice a few pawns in their own mind to try and win the chess game
[1:36:26.500 --> 1:36:30.180]  and that's what they see us as they see us as disposable and expendable and
[1:36:30.740 --> 1:36:37.060]  Yes, we're living in 2022. We're living in a society and a world which is very very technologically advanced
[1:36:37.220 --> 1:36:39.860]  There is no reason for anywhere to be running out of power
[1:36:39.860 --> 1:36:46.180]  We've had electricity for long enough and when that starts happening to believe it's some kind of accident or coincidence
[1:36:46.660 --> 1:36:49.380]  Is asinine it is impossible in the current world
[1:36:49.380 --> 1:36:51.940]  We live in with all the current resource and all the smart people on the planet
[1:36:51.940 --> 1:36:56.020]  And the fact that we all know we need electricity and the fact that we had all the electricity we needed
[1:36:56.260 --> 1:37:01.300]  In the 80s to now be here 40 or 50 years later and say we can't generate electricity
[1:37:01.540 --> 1:37:03.540]  That is clown world fantasy
[1:37:04.820 --> 1:37:08.580]  And the globalists said they were going to cut the power off they cut off thousands of coal power plants here alone
[1:37:08.580 --> 1:37:10.180]  while China builds three a week
[1:37:10.180 --> 1:37:14.020]  I think that it's very very important that we understand if we do not hang together
[1:37:14.100 --> 1:37:19.220]  We will hang one by one and it's important it's important for people to sit here and think well
[1:37:19.300 --> 1:37:25.220]  He got banned. Maybe he was too extreme. This guy got banned. Maybe he said this one bad thing once
[1:37:25.620 --> 1:37:28.020]  He got banned. Maybe the media has a point
[1:37:28.260 --> 1:37:33.780]  They don't have a point if they had a genuine point and they weren't afraid of open debate and discourse
[1:37:33.860 --> 1:37:37.220]  Then nobody would be getting banned at all and they're pushing things far too
[1:37:37.220 --> 1:37:42.420]  Close to the to the barrier and they're doing that on purpose because they fear different ideas
[1:37:42.820 --> 1:37:47.220]  I do believe that god has a plan for the world and his plan is not to allow
[1:37:47.620 --> 1:37:49.780]  These people to completely not leave burden to the ground
[1:37:50.180 --> 1:37:55.780]  I do believe that we're in a period of a redemption arc for humanity and things have gotten dark now
[1:37:55.860 --> 1:37:58.900]  But a ball always hits the bottom before it bounces to the top
[1:37:59.220 --> 1:38:04.580]  But it's very important the people who are awake and the people who understand not only try and educate as many people as possible
[1:38:04.580 --> 1:38:09.220]  But also support each other and also support the leaders like yourself and like myself
[1:38:09.460 --> 1:38:14.500]  We're out here taking on the risk and the responsibility of being completely de-platformed de-person
[1:38:15.060 --> 1:38:19.700]  Uh, having serious threats on our safety and security to try and tell the truth
[1:38:20.420 --> 1:38:26.580]  It's it's been a very interesting few years and we've seen what happens when people don't have a voice and don't stand up and try and
[1:38:26.580 --> 1:38:27.780]  Repel against these systems
[1:38:28.100 --> 1:38:32.820]  I really do think that the acts that have happened across these last few years in the name of trying to save lives for
[1:38:32.820 --> 1:38:37.460]  COVID have been genuinely genuinely criminal and I don't think they would have tested this kind of system
[1:38:37.620 --> 1:38:41.940]  Or tested this kind of censorship and repression to just stop it and go back to normal
[1:38:42.180 --> 1:38:46.980]  I think it was a test of a system and they intend on coming in harder than ever before
[1:38:47.300 --> 1:38:50.660]  With some new story and some new excuse later on down the line
[1:38:50.980 --> 1:38:56.180]  And it gets to a point where you finally have to stand up and realize that you cannot run from what is going to come to you
[1:38:56.420 --> 1:38:58.420]  You cannot escape it. You cannot hide
[1:38:58.420 --> 1:39:03.620]  You cannot deny it. You get to a point where you understand you need to find people who are like minded and stand up
[1:39:04.100 --> 1:39:09.300]  And the best way you can stand up at this current point in time is just to educate others and just to highlight the injustices
[1:39:09.300 --> 1:39:13.780]  Which are being purported by these systems. My banning was absolutely not the unjust
[1:39:13.940 --> 1:39:15.620]  I never broke any terms of service
[1:39:15.620 --> 1:39:20.180]  They know that the whole world knows that now and the public sentiment is on my side
[1:39:20.500 --> 1:39:25.060]  And the more people talk about this and the more people discuss this and tell others and educate others
[1:39:25.060 --> 1:39:28.980]  The harder it's going to be for them to keep this curtain this iron curtain of theirs
[1:39:29.380 --> 1:39:33.620]  Over the truth because that's all they truly want to do. They have shut us down
[1:39:33.700 --> 1:39:36.980]  This is warfare against the west because the western ideal
[1:39:37.620 --> 1:39:41.780]  Cannot operate when the globalists have all these other countries under slavery people will aspire
[1:39:42.180 --> 1:39:43.860]  to western freedom
[1:39:43.860 --> 1:39:45.780]  And so it has to be gotten rid of can you speak to that?
[1:39:47.060 --> 1:39:52.020]  Oh, yeah, completely and utterly and they have to change society and change the basis on which society is run
[1:39:52.020 --> 1:39:55.220]  Society was run on in the west on the premise of freedom
[1:39:55.460 --> 1:39:59.380]  You can come to the west and if you comply with the law, we will provide you with freedom
[1:39:59.620 --> 1:40:04.340]  They've realized that like you said that doesn't give them enough control and that's what tyrants are obsessed with
[1:40:04.500 --> 1:40:09.940]  So they want to replace freedom with safety because it's the only thing that people will accept their freedom being taken away for
[1:40:09.940 --> 1:40:12.820]  We're going to take all your freedom away, but don't worry. You're going to be safe
[1:40:13.060 --> 1:40:16.420]  We'll be safe from the common cold. You'll be safe from whatever else
[1:40:16.660 --> 1:40:21.380]  So they're trying to destroy our freedoms and replace it with safety now to replace thing to replace
[1:40:21.380 --> 1:40:25.140]  Freedom with safety. You need to convince people that they're in danger. How do you do that?
[1:40:25.380 --> 1:40:29.940]  Well, you either either create a media spin and convince everyone the common cold is somehow deadly
[1:40:30.260 --> 1:40:33.860]  Or what you can do is you can cause blackouts cause mass crime
[1:40:34.260 --> 1:40:39.860]  Rates to increase cause mass famine and put people in danger for real because when they're in real danger
[1:40:39.860 --> 1:40:42.900]  And they're really scared then they'll really sign up for safety
[1:40:43.140 --> 1:40:46.260]  If there's only going to be one town in the whole state that has electricity
[1:40:46.260 --> 1:40:51.300]  You're going to agree with whatever piece of paper they make you sign whatever rules you have to agree to
[1:40:51.540 --> 1:40:53.940]  You're going to agree to get in and that's what they're trying to do
[1:40:54.740 --> 1:40:58.740]  And they admit that club of Rome Bilderberg group and its spokesperson claus Schwab
[1:40:58.980 --> 1:41:01.380]  Wef says we're going to get rid of the old system
[1:41:01.380 --> 1:41:06.340]  That's the great reset to build back better and you're going to have a universal basic income with program tokens
[1:41:06.580 --> 1:41:11.780]  That tell you where and how and and when you can spend that money. I mean that is beyond the mark of the beast
[1:41:11.780 --> 1:41:18.100]  Oh, absolutely because if anybody understands the world understands that every single system on the planet is absolutely
[1:41:18.100 --> 1:41:23.220]  Not really corrupt the judicial systems corrupt the law systems corrupt the medical systems are now corrupted
[1:41:23.460 --> 1:41:27.460]  Everything's corrupt. So any system that involves humanity at any level is going to have a degree of corruption
[1:41:27.620 --> 1:41:30.900]  And if you think they're going to give you these tokens and it's going to be somehow fair and non corrupt
[1:41:30.900 --> 1:41:35.780]  You are a idealist at best and an idiot at worst probably a combination of the two
[1:41:35.780 --> 1:41:42.260]  I often say to people if you go to a poker game and there's no referee and there's $5,000 at stake
[1:41:42.260 --> 1:41:45.140]  Do you think people would cheat without any kind of referee and people say?
[1:41:45.140 --> 1:41:49.940]  Well, yeah, probably so if you understand that people will cheat in a poker game or a basketball game for
[1:41:50.020 --> 1:41:52.500]  Meal amounts of money without any kind of judge or referee
[1:41:52.740 --> 1:41:58.020]  How are you going to sit and then believe that the most powerful people on the planet to control nations and control entire populaces
[1:41:58.020 --> 1:42:02.260]  They're not going to cheat and bend the rules. Of course. They are this is human nature. That's absolutely what they're going to do
[1:42:02.260 --> 1:42:06.580]  They're not going to risk losing. So they're going to cheat and lie and be corrupt their entire way
[1:42:06.740 --> 1:42:09.060]  That's the only thing they're interested in is absolutely in our power
[1:42:11.220 --> 1:42:15.620]  Ladies and gentlemen people decided 500 years ago in europe to stop the old
[1:42:16.580 --> 1:42:21.460]  System of tyranny and to create liberty for our children and it produced incredible wealth and power
[1:42:21.860 --> 1:42:25.860]  Now that's all being erased stand with androtage stand with stevenin

[1:46:56.580 --> 1:47:12.580]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[1:47:29.380 --> 1:47:33.780]  That's where we are. That's what the lockdowns did. That's the real world. We're living in
[1:47:34.740 --> 1:47:40.180]  And if you think you're immune from the starvation and death the lobalists are carrying out against the third world think again
[1:47:40.820 --> 1:47:42.500]  That's what we're fighting
[1:47:42.500 --> 1:47:44.900]  And now we have this eugenicist epopulationist
[1:47:45.780 --> 1:47:47.780]  new king of england
[1:47:48.660 --> 1:47:51.620]  That is being put in charge. This is just an incredible moment
[1:47:51.780 --> 1:47:54.980]  He's deeply embedded with the world economic forum and their programs
[1:47:54.980 --> 1:48:01.540]  But as I said, I interviewed and retake yesterday. We're adding a bunch of clips and documentation and it's going to be huge on monday
[1:48:02.500 --> 1:48:05.620]  We're going to be airing it. But here is one more clip
[1:48:06.580 --> 1:48:08.580]  A little prelude to what's coming up
[1:48:09.220 --> 1:48:13.620]  Where he talks about the systems afraid of real masculine men. Here it is
[1:48:14.020 --> 1:48:19.860]  You said it aspired to something young people aren't aspiring to anything the left teaches them to be lazy
[1:48:20.180 --> 1:48:22.980]  To be victims to be depressed and that's cool
[1:48:22.980 --> 1:48:27.700]  No when you're fighting in a business or for your family or for your life or
[1:48:28.180 --> 1:48:30.820]  Getting up to go to your friend's house when they need your help
[1:48:31.540 --> 1:48:36.500]  And then them helping you that's the real brotherhood the sisterhood that the the the human
[1:48:37.460 --> 1:48:42.340]  Community of being a clan and we're one human species that needs those goals
[1:48:42.660 --> 1:48:46.900]  And so people need to aspire and say I want to be successful
[1:48:47.460 --> 1:48:51.540]  Because it's not even getting to the success that matters. It's aspiring to it
[1:48:51.540 --> 1:48:56.900]  It's what you're supposed to do because you've got to have a purpose driven life and a mission and these young people need a mission
[1:48:57.060 --> 1:48:59.060]  And you're giving them a mission
[1:48:59.300 --> 1:49:04.020]  Absolutely and what's actually interesting is this extremely hypocritical because when the hits the fan
[1:49:04.260 --> 1:49:10.180]  When they need soldiers to go die in a war when they need firemen to charge into a burning building when they need police officers
[1:49:10.420 --> 1:49:11.380]  To
[1:49:11.380 --> 1:49:16.740]  Hopefully save children in school shooting and not just stand outside when they need real men to go do real things
[1:49:16.980 --> 1:49:19.380]  Then they call on the men like me and the men who think like me
[1:49:19.380 --> 1:49:24.420]  Then they want the men who are brave who are masculine who have tenets of masculinity who have honor who have duty
[1:49:24.420 --> 1:49:28.100]  Then they want us but as soon as they don't want us to go risk our lives to protect them
[1:49:28.340 --> 1:49:32.580]  They say we're not allowed opinion. We're not allowed to think we're not allowed to talk and we should be de-personed and deleted
[1:49:32.820 --> 1:49:38.260]  They try and use us absolutely not early because society needs men like us and i'm the one who's been speaking up for them
[1:49:38.420 --> 1:49:42.980]  They also pretend they give a about men's mental health. You told me one example about how I helped your friend
[1:49:43.220 --> 1:49:45.700]  I have hundreds of thousands of emails for young men
[1:49:45.700 --> 1:49:49.780]  I've helped and older men who I've helped with their mindset and helped with their approach towards life
[1:49:50.180 --> 1:49:53.540]  I have genuinely changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people for the better
[1:49:53.860 --> 1:50:00.340]  They talk about giving a about men and giving a about men's mental health while deleting me the person who helps them the most
[1:50:00.580 --> 1:50:03.380]  And saying they're going to replace me with some algorithm
[1:50:03.780 --> 1:50:09.060]  Matrix agent bot like logan paul who nobody respects and doesn't want to listen to it's bullshit
[1:50:09.140 --> 1:50:12.580]  They gave a about men's mental health. They'd leave me up there to inspire the youth
[1:50:12.580 --> 1:50:15.540]  They don't care all they care about is narrative control
[1:50:16.580 --> 1:50:18.740]  Are you uh, gonna get in the ring with logan paul?
[1:50:20.180 --> 1:50:23.700]  Let's hope for his sake it never happens because he doesn't want to get hurt that badly
[1:50:23.940 --> 1:50:27.700]  I just find it very interesting what happened to me and probably the same thing happened to you
[1:50:28.420 --> 1:50:34.260]  During my banning. I saw in real time and learned which public figures which talking heads
[1:50:34.260 --> 1:50:38.900]  Which are allowed to have a platform by the matrix actually have any kind of degree of character
[1:50:38.900 --> 1:50:44.980]  And which ones will instantly bend break and swap and change their opinion on you overnight because somebody above them told them
[1:50:44.980 --> 1:50:48.260]  They have to you get to learn in real time who actually sticks up for you
[1:50:48.260 --> 1:50:52.420]  And it's true and some people are and which ones just instantly cave and comply
[1:50:52.900 --> 1:50:55.780]  You'd be amazed how many people have absolutely no moral fiber
[1:50:58.580 --> 1:51:00.900]  All right, so that interview drops
[1:51:01.540 --> 1:51:02.740]  Monday
[1:51:02.740 --> 1:51:05.540]  That was about eight minutes of it and powerful
[1:51:05.540 --> 1:51:11.860]  I don't say something's powerful unless it's powerful. That was powerful and dr. Andrew wakefield is powerful
[1:51:12.260 --> 1:51:16.420]  Because he went through hell and and and was demonized and lied about by the corporate press
[1:51:16.660 --> 1:51:20.100]  Same way. I've been total misrepresentations, but it came out a decade later
[1:51:20.340 --> 1:51:25.700]  What he said was dead on in the research and they falsified the reports on him. He is uniquely positioned
[1:51:27.700 --> 1:51:30.740]  He's in that green room right there. It'll be here with us about 10 minutes to studio
[1:51:30.740 --> 1:51:34.980]  To speak to
[1:51:34.980 --> 1:51:37.860]  They lied about the shot doesn't protect you not attend dying
[1:51:38.660 --> 1:51:40.660]  have been triple jabbed

[1:56:01.300 --> 1:56:06.580]  New York against white people by racist crazy black people brainwashed that whites are bad

[1:56:15.460 --> 1:56:19.300]  Because they're white. This is the corporate media trying to get a race war going
[1:56:19.300 --> 1:56:23.300]  99% of black people do not support this and they're not our enemy
[1:56:23.860 --> 1:56:28.340]  But they're trying to get us to kill each other just like when they wind up some crazy white supremacist to go into a
[1:56:29.300 --> 1:56:34.580]  Black grocery store and kill a bunch of people in Buffalo that ladies and gentlemen. We later learned

[1:56:50.580 --> 1:56:52.580]  They cover it up because
[1:56:53.380 --> 1:56:56.500]  They're trying to build this momentum with these George Soros

[1:57:11.300 --> 1:57:15.380]  Or the white person does bad things to black people. It's it's not other white people's fault
[1:57:15.380 --> 1:57:20.580]  It's the person that did it and I know our general audience knows that but let's not take the bait

[1:57:36.420 --> 1:57:40.420]  We blame the corporate media that hyped it up and they didn't blame black people
[1:57:40.420 --> 1:57:44.340]  That hyped it up and then covered it up. They're the real ones doing it. We'll be right back

[2:01:15.860 --> 2:01:19.380]  The communist chinese have taken control of the main universities. This is all confirmed
[2:01:19.380 --> 2:01:24.500]  This is not a drill big tech and silicon valley is almost completely run by the communist chinese government

[2:02:05.940 --> 2:02:09.460]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression
[2:02:09.780 --> 2:02:16.740]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing

[2:02:53.460 --> 2:02:58.340]  Where every angle of my good is turned against us. So they take what I've said being sincere
[2:02:58.340 --> 2:03:04.740]  Build me into an insincere person in the straw man. I'm person that cares about life and children and is against these wars
[2:03:04.820 --> 2:03:10.180]  And so they make me a herder of children and then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction

[2:07:01.300 --> 2:07:03.300]  But when I think about a redemption art
[2:07:04.100 --> 2:07:10.020]  Um, you did real research as a research scientist. You you put the information out and you've been proven right
[2:07:10.100 --> 2:07:13.460]  You've been vindicated and now here we are in the year 2022
[2:07:13.460 --> 2:07:19.860]  And nobody's laughing at dr. Wakefield now. We're we're crying actually so good to have you here my friend
[2:07:20.100 --> 2:07:22.580]  God bless you and i'm gonna try to shut up because you know, I talk a lot
[2:07:22.900 --> 2:07:27.300]  If you just start wherever you want, maybe recap who you are. We have a big audience new listeners every day
[2:07:27.300 --> 2:07:31.780]  There's probably a million new listeners right now with andrew tate and steve bannon on today
[2:07:31.780 --> 2:07:36.420]  We've usually got three million viewers like about five million today. So wherever you want to start. This is important
[2:07:36.980 --> 2:07:40.180]  Alex, it's great to be back on the show. Thank you very much. I uh
[2:07:40.180 --> 2:07:44.500]  For those who don't know I started as I graduated in medicine in 1981
[2:07:45.140 --> 2:07:52.500]  In london st. Mary's hospital part of six generations of my family who have trained as doctors there and the fundamental teaching to me
[2:07:52.980 --> 2:07:55.860]  Was to listen to listen to the patient or the patient's parents
[2:07:56.180 --> 2:08:02.100]  Because the thing the first thing they tell you will be the clue to what's wrong with them and that has gone from medicine now and in
[2:08:03.300 --> 2:08:07.460]  1995 mothers started calling me and saying my child was absolutely normal
[2:08:07.460 --> 2:08:12.020]  And then they had a triple vaccine mmr and they regressed into autism
[2:08:12.420 --> 2:08:17.060]  I said, I know nothing about autism. I get i'm a gastroenterologist. How can I help and they said my child has
[2:08:17.620 --> 2:08:24.180]  Terrible gi problems diarrhea wasting failure to thrive. They're in pain. I know they're in pain. They've lost the ability to speak
[2:08:24.420 --> 2:08:26.420]  but as their mother, I know they're in pain
[2:08:26.900 --> 2:08:28.340]  and um
[2:08:28.340 --> 2:08:31.060]  Every doctor I've spoken to has dismissed this and sent me away
[2:08:31.460 --> 2:08:36.180]  And so we investigated this and as is always the case and as and the parents were right the children had
[2:08:36.180 --> 2:08:39.620]  intestinal inflammation when we treated that not only did it heal
[2:08:40.260 --> 2:08:43.060]  the intestinal inflammation it made the autism better and so
[2:08:43.780 --> 2:08:45.780]  we um
[2:08:45.860 --> 2:08:51.220]  We pursued the vaccine issue and against a lot of pushback from my colleagues and the medical school and
[2:08:51.620 --> 2:08:54.340]  heavy investment from pharmaceutical companies and
[2:08:55.140 --> 2:09:02.500]  And it turned out to be absolutely right to right to the extent that when the cdc investigated it later in the as we reported in the film
[2:09:02.580 --> 2:09:03.540]  Vaxed
[2:09:03.540 --> 2:09:06.340]  Vaxxed they found the data
[2:09:06.980 --> 2:09:09.460]  So compelling that linked mmr vaccine autism
[2:09:09.460 --> 2:09:14.340]  They had to destroy the data and to produce a paper that said something completely different
[2:09:14.900 --> 2:09:19.700]  One of their senior scientists came forward 14 years later and said we have done a terrible thing
[2:09:19.780 --> 2:09:26.180]  We have lied and we have put millions of children at risk of serious serious permanent neurological injury
[2:09:26.740 --> 2:09:32.020]  And nothing happened and that that that was what made me so angry at the time alex and I thought there is no accountability
[2:09:32.020 --> 2:09:35.780]  And from that point forward my films were about
[2:09:36.420 --> 2:09:42.900]  Accountability people have to be held accountable for the damage they've done and uh, I should have added your films have been seen
[2:09:42.900 --> 2:09:44.900]  close to a billion times and
[2:09:45.300 --> 2:09:47.300]  I mean you're like the original
[2:09:47.300 --> 2:09:49.300]  Oh gee when it comes to exposing this
[2:09:49.620 --> 2:09:53.460]  Is it surreal to now see it be the number one issue and just the carnage?
[2:09:54.660 --> 2:10:00.660]  You know, it's fascinating alex when I started this there were five of us around the world who were prepared to talk openly about vaccine safety issues
[2:10:00.660 --> 2:10:06.180]  Now that number because of coveted and because of the movies is more than
[2:10:06.820 --> 2:10:13.700]  Half the adult population of the world that is where this has come from and so people so you're a human perseverance telling the truth story
[2:10:13.860 --> 2:10:18.260]  It's not about lionizing. I know you don't want that but people that are down but telling the truth need to know
[2:10:18.660 --> 2:10:20.660]  There's as Martin Luther King said
[2:10:22.340 --> 2:10:24.340]  The universe bends towards justice
[2:10:25.220 --> 2:10:28.180]  It needs and we absolutely need that and we need accountability
[2:10:28.180 --> 2:10:32.100]  We need justice a lot of kids have been harmed and as you pointed out with this coveted shot
[2:10:32.660 --> 2:10:36.740]  A lot of a lot more people are being harmed, but it has woken people up to the fact that
[2:10:37.380 --> 2:10:41.060]  This has been perpetrated by a pharmaceutical industry and a government
[2:10:41.700 --> 2:10:46.900]  Consortium that is working together that is not in the interests of the american people the people of the world
[2:10:47.220 --> 2:10:49.860]  But is in the interests of profit over people
[2:10:50.020 --> 2:10:56.100]  You've gone from a true voice of the wilderness being demonized attacked destroyed reborn like the phoenix have indicated
[2:10:56.100 --> 2:11:00.420]  But i'm sure you're not even happy with that because you i know you'd rather just stop this
[2:11:01.220 --> 2:11:05.460]  Yeah, it's not about me and what i realized halfway through this alexis. It's not about me
[2:11:05.860 --> 2:11:08.820]  So the all the insults were directed against me
[2:11:08.820 --> 2:11:13.940]  It was made to sound personal about it was actually about something far more important and that is the
[2:11:14.340 --> 2:11:16.340]  survival of the human species the
[2:11:16.580 --> 2:11:21.700]  The children and grandchildren the future of this country of the world were at
[2:11:21.700 --> 2:11:25.380]  At risk and that had i had to do something about that. That's right
[2:11:25.380 --> 2:11:30.820]  This is the depopulationist attack and i brought that up as you've raised that in the last few interviews years ago
[2:11:31.220 --> 2:11:32.660]  When you went through hell
[2:11:32.660 --> 2:11:35.940]  When i'm under attack when i realize i'm part of the human species they just say
[2:11:36.260 --> 2:11:38.500]  They're attacking us all then i have total peace
[2:11:39.060 --> 2:11:41.540]  And at that moment the enemy loses power over you
[2:11:42.260 --> 2:11:44.260]  It is absolutely my job not only to
[2:11:44.980 --> 2:11:48.980]  persevere and prevail but to thrive in this arena i need to
[2:11:49.540 --> 2:11:51.540]  act as a
[2:11:51.540 --> 2:11:57.860]  Beacon if anything to people other doctors other scientists that it there is life after this you come out you do the right thing
[2:11:57.940 --> 2:12:03.780]  You do the right thing by your by virtue of your training by virtue of the ethics that bind your
[2:12:04.500 --> 2:12:07.300]  And i want to get to what's currently happening, but i'm gonna shut up next segment
[2:12:07.300 --> 2:12:10.980]  But recap what happened to you they said this is important and a lot of folks will know about this
[2:12:11.140 --> 2:12:16.420]  Well, i offended the pharmaceutical industry the cdc the nih i offended everybody they i went against
[2:12:16.420 --> 2:12:23.060]  Uh an agenda that threatened their bottom line and their policy and i said look all i said is that further work needs to be
[2:12:23.060 --> 2:12:28.900]  Done to establish whether there's a relationship between this vaccine and autism and the heavens opened and came down on me and
[2:12:29.540 --> 2:12:33.540]  And so for many many years there was an attack
[2:12:33.860 --> 2:12:36.980]  They put james murdoch onto a rupert murdoch sun
[2:12:36.980 --> 2:12:42.420]  They put him onto the board of glaxo smith kline the biggest manufacturer of m mr vaccine in europe
[2:12:42.740 --> 2:12:45.140]  His job was to come after me and that's what he did
[2:12:45.140 --> 2:12:48.980]  And so using mainstream media i was
[2:12:49.700 --> 2:12:53.220]  Villified and it it was very difficult. It was me on one side them on the other side
[2:12:53.700 --> 2:12:57.780]  And it it was there was some tough times ahead, but in the end
[2:12:58.260 --> 2:12:58.980]  uh
[2:12:58.980 --> 2:13:01.940]  sadly the sheer weight of numbers of damaged children the
[2:13:02.740 --> 2:13:10.180]  Inevitability of the association the fact that the parents had come forward and simply told the truth about what happened to their children
[2:13:10.180 --> 2:13:16.660]  And the cdc having to fake the data to get rid of that effect. I mean all of these things culminated in a
[2:13:17.540 --> 2:13:22.180]  A major shift a seismic shift and you were given chances to back down, but you didn't
[2:13:22.740 --> 2:13:25.540]  No, absolutely not. This was far too important as i say alex
[2:13:25.540 --> 2:13:29.220]  It wasn't about me it was about the future of the children of the world
[2:13:29.300 --> 2:13:34.740]  But it was about you they made about you think if they could break you they would break us, but you didn't break
[2:13:36.180 --> 2:13:38.180]  I didn't break
[2:13:38.180 --> 2:13:40.180]  Well
[2:13:40.180 --> 2:13:41.540]  and so um
[2:13:41.540 --> 2:13:46.660]  It came to the next movie the infertility movie that you you mentioned and and that was i was
[2:13:47.220 --> 2:13:50.660]  finishing up a a movie 1986 the act about how the
[2:13:51.380 --> 2:13:53.780]  pharmaceutical companies were given liability from
[2:13:54.740 --> 2:13:59.380]  Liability protection from death and damage caused by their vaccine something that was really not known
[2:13:59.940 --> 2:14:06.180]  To the public in the way that it should have been that they had the perfect business model that they had a mandatory market
[2:14:06.180 --> 2:14:10.100]  Kids had to get vaccines to go to school. They had no liability. No downside
[2:14:10.340 --> 2:14:15.860]  They weren't going to pay anything for medical legal for and so what we had is a situation of perfect business model
[2:14:16.100 --> 2:14:22.100]  All they could do was make a profit. They made a massive profit and that really that profit made them so powerful that allowed them to do
[2:14:22.100 --> 2:14:24.100]  what they have done
[2:14:24.100 --> 2:14:26.100]  with covid with covid shots
[2:14:26.100 --> 2:14:29.700]  and perpetrate this crime upon the human population and so
[2:14:30.340 --> 2:14:33.700]  I uh, I stuck with it um, and
[2:14:33.700 --> 2:14:39.700]  I then finished that film up. That was number film number three and then, uh, bobby
[2:14:39.700 --> 2:14:45.700]  Kennedy's team presented me with this data that would have been shot in east africa in kenya about infertility vaccines
[2:14:45.700 --> 2:14:47.700]  and that's something that I kind of
[2:14:47.700 --> 2:14:48.980]  Dismissed for a long time
[2:14:48.980 --> 2:14:55.220]  Well, I was completely wrong to have done that because when I looked at the data there in the published literature has been
[2:14:55.940 --> 2:14:59.460]  Papers said talking about the design and the the ultimate
[2:14:59.460 --> 2:15:05.300]  Successful design of anti fertility vaccines for use in the third world now what they did then
[2:15:05.940 --> 2:15:10.820]  And this was the allegation from the catholic church in kenya. There is a major health care provider
[2:15:10.820 --> 2:15:17.940]  So it was a significant challenge that you are using this vaccine to render women infertile without
[2:15:18.340 --> 2:15:25.300]  Giving them any informed consent at all women of reproductive age 15 to 50 years of age were being we're going to go to break
[2:15:25.300 --> 2:15:31.060]  Dr. Wakefield, I'm gonna shut up because this is your new film will play the trailer at the bottom of the hour in about 15 minutes
[2:15:31.060 --> 2:15:34.900]  But this is what it's all they have you and admitting they have infertility vaccines
[2:15:35.140 --> 2:15:37.140]  They add this hormone to the shot
[2:15:37.140 --> 2:15:41.220]  All of it. I mean they're caught red-handed and this is the precursor to everything
[2:15:41.220 --> 2:15:49.140]  We're facing now with the connections to these mrna shots and reduced fertility dr. Andrew wakefields our guests the new film infertility a
[2:15:49.140 --> 2:15:55.700]  Diabolical agenda will tell you how to see the film coming up

[2:17:57.620 --> 2:18:03.780]  We're force fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media by the controlled churches and the universities
[2:18:04.420 --> 2:18:06.100]  Why is this the case?
[2:18:06.100 --> 2:18:08.100]  Because we innately by god
[2:18:08.580 --> 2:18:12.100]  Have been given the keys for our own minds our own psyches our own souls
[2:18:12.580 --> 2:18:17.620]  And by connecting to god we can empower ourselves and trend send the quote
[2:18:18.180 --> 2:18:20.180]  Fallen or sinful state
[2:18:20.180 --> 2:18:22.180]  So the chemicals that we ingest
[2:18:22.180 --> 2:18:26.580]  And then all the things we try to bring into our bodies to change who we are
[2:18:27.140 --> 2:18:31.460]  Are only lowering us. They're only making us press and the end. They're only making us less filled
[2:18:32.100 --> 2:18:37.300]  It is only by going within and really making that connection to god that we can truly empower ourselves
[2:18:37.860 --> 2:18:43.540]  That's why the globos bombardous toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals
[2:18:43.860 --> 2:18:49.780]  Trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond our bodies
[2:18:49.780 --> 2:18:52.820]  Be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension
[2:18:53.140 --> 2:18:56.100]  And that's where the incredible products come in at infowarstore.com
[2:18:57.140 --> 2:18:59.140]  We are now living in the void
[2:18:59.620 --> 2:19:05.220]  Sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what we've known and what's to come
[2:19:05.620 --> 2:19:09.140]  And right now the most important thing to remember is
[2:19:09.700 --> 2:19:11.700]  Don't panic stay calm
[2:19:11.940 --> 2:19:18.180]  Because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe sound course
[2:19:18.180 --> 2:19:22.580]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules
[2:19:23.140 --> 2:19:28.580]  And building our own society all we got to do is survive the crash and right now
[2:19:28.820 --> 2:19:34.740]  We still have time to prepare the world fiat currency system is racing towards zero
[2:19:35.140 --> 2:19:38.020]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now

[2:19:55.780 --> 2:20:14.580]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[2:20:14.580 --> 2:20:28.580]  So one of the original fighters over the last
[2:20:29.380 --> 2:20:36.100]  27 years dr. Andrew wakefield is in studio with us the new film infertility a diabolical agenda
[2:20:37.380 --> 2:20:41.220]  People need to go there. They need to watch the film need to get it out to everybody. They know we'll play the trailer
[2:20:41.220 --> 2:20:47.540]  The next segment so we've talked about some of your past what's currently happening and this key area of infertility
[2:20:48.420 --> 2:20:53.300]  and sterilization vaccines you go to the un website type in infertility sterilization vaccines
[2:20:53.460 --> 2:20:55.460]  It's a 30 40 year program
[2:20:55.940 --> 2:21:00.820]  So i'm going to try to shut up now doctors you can lay this out and why this is the next big push in your research
[2:21:01.380 --> 2:21:07.300]  Yeah, the infertility vaccine program started in in new deli in india but funded by the world health organization
[2:21:07.300 --> 2:21:15.460]  And it started around the early 1970s, but by 1993 they'd been successfully developed an anti fertility vaccine
[2:21:15.460 --> 2:21:18.260]  And they then deployed that in developing countries
[2:21:18.820 --> 2:21:20.420]  And they did so
[2:21:20.420 --> 2:21:26.420]  Without any informed consent to the women involved and it was much worse than that alex they did so by
[2:21:27.140 --> 2:21:32.340]  Claiming that these women were taking part in an anti tetanus vaccine campaign
[2:21:32.340 --> 2:21:38.340]  Designed to protect the neonates the the newborn children in in those countries
[2:21:38.340 --> 2:21:43.780]  So not only were they not given informed consent. They were lied to about the purpose. That was the allegation
[2:21:44.420 --> 2:21:50.660]  This this story is really the uncovering revealing of who was right who was wrong who lied
[2:21:50.980 --> 2:21:58.580]  Who told the truth because of course as happens when the few doctors came out and said we are concerned that you are conducting
[2:21:58.580 --> 2:22:02.900]  An anti fertility vaccine program under the guise of a tetanus program
[2:22:03.460 --> 2:22:04.660]  then
[2:22:04.660 --> 2:22:09.060]  The heavens opened upon them and the kenyan government the world health organization came down on them
[2:22:09.460 --> 2:22:16.660]  It finally came to a study a test will put our vaccines in you put your vaccines in from the same campaign
[2:22:17.140 --> 2:22:23.460]  We will get them analyzed in an accredited laboratory and will prove to you that there is no anti fertility vaccine in there
[2:22:23.460 --> 2:22:28.660]  And I don't want to spoil the end of the film, but it is an incredible tale of how
[2:22:29.380 --> 2:22:32.500]  A government and the world health organization were prepared
[2:22:32.980 --> 2:22:35.940]  To deceive the african people the kenyan people
[2:22:36.500 --> 2:22:40.660]  The kenyan mothers the kenyan mothers to be not only to
[2:22:42.020 --> 2:22:49.220]  Stop them bearing children in the future, but to abort existing pregnancies successful pregnancies. It's an extraordinary story
[2:22:49.220 --> 2:22:54.420]  Um, it's only half an hour. It's free to watch. So please go and watch it because there is where do they find it?
[2:22:54.420 --> 2:22:56.420]  I want our millions of listeners right now
[2:22:56.980 --> 2:23:03.140]  Infertility the movie.com. That's it infertility the movie.com and there is an extraordinary one of the doctors in that
[2:23:03.220 --> 2:23:05.860]  Dr. Karanja at the end of the story. He says
[2:23:07.700 --> 2:23:12.580]  Watch out he says when they are finished with Africa, they are coming for you
[2:23:13.300 --> 2:23:17.300]  Keep your children close. They will come for them and they will come for you
[2:23:17.300 --> 2:23:21.620]  And it was a prophetic warning to the rest of the world and that's exactly what happened now
[2:23:21.860 --> 2:23:27.860]  Dr. Karanja died under mysterious circumstances like five african presidents that wouldn't take the covid thing died
[2:23:28.020 --> 2:23:30.020]  Absolutely, and it was blamed on covid
[2:23:31.060 --> 2:23:36.260]  No, this man his fact according to his family. He was perfectly fit and healthy globalists have a real heart on for africans
[2:23:37.380 --> 2:23:42.260]  oh, yeah, and that so it is an extraordinary story and uh one that really
[2:23:42.260 --> 2:23:47.380]  Reminded me of just how deceitful and how dishonest these people
[2:23:47.940 --> 2:23:50.660]  Really are if there's if we any of us needed reminding
[2:23:51.380 --> 2:23:56.740]  And so finally alex we come to the new movie which we're in pre-production right here in austin right now
[2:23:57.060 --> 2:24:01.940]  This is now. Oh, it's good to have you back. How do you move here? You moved to l.a. to produce films now you're back
[2:24:02.660 --> 2:24:08.660]  Yeah, I I lived in on a boat in in biscayne bay in south florida for a while as well and then I
[2:24:09.300 --> 2:24:11.700]  Now i'm back here in austin making this new movie
[2:24:11.700 --> 2:24:15.700]  So uh exciting times great to have you brother. Please continue with the new film the new film
[2:24:15.700 --> 2:24:19.700]  Well, it was co-written the good thing about the bad thing about the pharmaceutical industry
[2:24:19.940 --> 2:24:25.700]  But the good thing for screenwriters is that they give you an abundance of stuff to work with material to work with the lies
[2:24:25.780 --> 2:24:29.700]  The fraud the deception the coercion the bullying the profit over people
[2:24:30.180 --> 2:24:33.300]  And so this is a story that came to me some years ago
[2:24:34.180 --> 2:24:37.860]  It's a whistleblower story and the classic genre of whistleblower stories like
[2:24:37.860 --> 2:24:42.420]  erin brokovic the big short this kind of thing and and uh, I sat down
[2:24:42.500 --> 2:24:46.020]  I co-wrote it with terry rossio and people say well, who's terry rossio?
[2:24:46.420 --> 2:24:50.180]  terry rossio wrote little known films like shrek pirates of the caribbean
[2:24:50.980 --> 2:24:57.700]  Aladdin godzilla versus king kong like so the good news is heavy hitters are deciding to join heavy hitters are joining in
[2:24:57.700 --> 2:25:01.860]  And that's changing the landscape completely. So I can tell you off record. That's happening with us, too
[2:25:02.180 --> 2:25:05.140]  So there's there's not just evil people in the world in fact historically
[2:25:05.140 --> 2:25:08.260]  Evil always gets its run like hitler and finally people wake up
[2:25:08.500 --> 2:25:12.740]  I think we're seeing that right now that finally good goes. Whoa. I gotta get up off the couch here
[2:25:12.980 --> 2:25:18.100]  And the irony is that what has woken so many people up apart from film is is covet
[2:25:18.660 --> 2:25:21.060]  covet has brought to people's attention just how
[2:25:21.860 --> 2:25:24.260]  Deceptive just how dishonest and just how
[2:25:25.140 --> 2:25:28.020]  So that's the good side of hollywood is you have top producers behind you know
[2:25:28.260 --> 2:25:32.020]  We have great people on the team and that's that's a wonderful thing the other film also
[2:25:32.020 --> 2:25:36.900]  Offers because of the way that hollywood is treated actors. You have to get this vaccine
[2:25:37.140 --> 2:25:40.020]  You cannot come on the set. You can't do this. You you're out of a job
[2:25:40.420 --> 2:25:46.020]  We've offered a home for people who have taken a view that no health freedom is actually much more important
[2:25:46.100 --> 2:25:50.180]  So we and again, it's not about a victory lap, but I was talking about dr. McCullough and dr
[2:25:50.660 --> 2:25:54.740]  Merkall and all of my you gotta do I was talking to Joe rugg this weekend at dinner
[2:25:54.980 --> 2:25:57.140]  And Joe's like, yeah, we won this fight. I know we haven't yet
[2:25:57.620 --> 2:26:00.500]  You've got to do a victory lap to show you were right. He was okay. I guess I'll do it
[2:26:00.500 --> 2:26:04.100]  But we need to say hey, we were right. I mean we were right
[2:26:04.740 --> 2:26:08.180]  We were the mainstream media likes to ignore the fact that all those
[2:26:08.740 --> 2:26:14.420]  Conspiracy theorists who came forward years ago have turned out to be absolutely right about everything that's happened
[2:26:14.820 --> 2:26:17.940]  You're a smart guy dr. Wakefield. How do you think the empire strikes back?
[2:26:19.700 --> 2:26:24.660]  How will it come well, I think and I try and put myself in their position many times
[2:26:24.660 --> 2:26:27.380]  You know, what's it like on k street in those highly paid?
[2:26:27.380 --> 2:26:31.620]  You know, the offices of those extremely highly paid sort of publicists and
[2:26:32.740 --> 2:26:37.540]  Front men for the pharmaceutical industry. It must be chaos. What have we got to do to get people to believe us?
[2:26:37.620 --> 2:26:42.100]  Because more and more and more people are walking away from this. We're winning. I've changed my mind
[2:26:42.500 --> 2:26:47.860]  You lied to us and we don't believe your vaccines are safe. My grandmother just died. My uncle died
[2:26:47.860 --> 2:26:53.460]  My father died my sit my siblings have died. What's going on? Why are all these sportsmen dropping dead?
[2:26:53.460 --> 2:26:59.700]  Dropping dead healthy people in the prime of life. What is going on and they're trying to contain that message
[2:26:59.780 --> 2:27:03.380]  It's getting out. It's getting out through the world. Thanks to people like you, Alex
[2:27:03.380 --> 2:27:07.060]  so people are waking up in the in droves to
[2:27:07.940 --> 2:27:13.380]  The reality of what we're facing and hopefully in time to do something effective about it
[2:27:15.220 --> 2:27:18.180]  They admit they're playing new lockdowns. They admit they're planning new viruses
[2:27:18.180 --> 2:27:23.220]  Yeah, I think they've got they've got major problems because people don't believe them anymore
[2:27:23.460 --> 2:27:27.220]  And so when they come along and say monkey pox that we got a new strain of this new strain of that
[2:27:27.460 --> 2:27:33.140]  And we're going to give you more that people are saying no actually we're turning our backs on this because even though we got the first shot
[2:27:34.020 --> 2:27:36.020]  Or we got the second shot. We're not going to get the booster
[2:27:36.100 --> 2:27:38.100]  Lowest level of vaccination
[2:27:38.100 --> 2:27:41.220]  Not just for covid any everybody's refusing it lowest level in history
[2:27:41.460 --> 2:27:45.860]  But I think what's happening is this is going across the bridge from the adult vaccine program with covid
[2:27:45.860 --> 2:27:51.700]  And people are saying wow this has been happening in the pediatric the childhood vaccine program for decades
[2:27:52.180 --> 2:27:55.540]  So why did they jump the shark and try this untested thing? I mean
[2:27:56.180 --> 2:27:59.380]  Why they were already in troubles that un said two and a half years ago in that meeting
[2:28:00.100 --> 2:28:05.220]  In switzerland, they said everybody's turning against us our own doctors think these vaccines are hurting people you see the videos
[2:28:05.540 --> 2:28:07.540]  Why would they think oh, well, let's just double down
[2:28:08.180 --> 2:28:10.180]  I think cony fact she has a lot to do with this
[2:28:10.980 --> 2:28:12.980]  When you are a politician
[2:28:12.980 --> 2:28:16.340]  Like trump or anyone else you know very little about the subject
[2:28:16.340 --> 2:28:20.740]  You are totally dependent on those people who give you expert or so-called expert advice
[2:28:20.740 --> 2:28:23.220]  You're not an epidemiologist not a virologist
[2:28:23.220 --> 2:28:27.060]  So if someone says to you we've got this pandemic sweeping the world people are going to die
[2:28:27.060 --> 2:28:30.260]  We need to move very very quickly to produce a vaccine you are
[2:28:30.900 --> 2:28:35.700]  You're terrified because you don't know okay. Well, let's do it. Let's do it because this is the advice
[2:28:35.700 --> 2:28:39.940]  I'm getting from my top medical advisor. What you've got to understand is that tony fact she
[2:28:39.940 --> 2:28:42.500]  Had a vaccine and vaccine only agenda
[2:28:43.620 --> 2:28:49.700]  The diseases for which he is responsible in this country for solving all the autoimmune diseases
[2:28:49.700 --> 2:28:54.340]  The allergic diseases have gone up dramatically if he was a seizure stay right there dr. Wakefield
[2:28:56.980 --> 2:29:03.140]  People ask me all the time what is your best at roping you've got turbo force you've got brain force plus
[2:29:03.860 --> 2:29:06.820]  And you've got brain force ultra which one is better?
[2:29:07.540 --> 2:29:09.540]  and that's like asking
[2:29:09.540 --> 2:29:11.700]  What's better a four death 150?
[2:29:12.500 --> 2:29:14.100]  or a Cadillac
[2:29:14.100 --> 2:29:16.100]  or a Ferrari
[2:29:16.420 --> 2:29:21.140]  It's different strokes for different folks. It varies all three are different formulas
[2:29:21.860 --> 2:29:25.860]  All three do different things turbo force is 10 hours of clean
[2:29:26.580 --> 2:29:29.540]  Out of control energy. I can't even take a whole pack myself
[2:29:30.260 --> 2:29:37.860]  Brain force plus is a long-term acting clean. Neutrophic. This brain force ultra is a super fast acting
[2:29:37.860 --> 2:29:39.860]  Neutropic
[2:29:40.420 --> 2:29:47.860]  Creates incredible clarity, but doesn't last very long. They're all three different formulas and finally back in stock massively discounted

[2:31:57.620 --> 2:32:05.300]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food
[2:32:05.380 --> 2:32:06.820]  It's all come out
[2:32:06.820 --> 2:32:11.780]  And they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the creator and we
[2:32:11.780 --> 2:32:16.180]  Are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much
[2:32:16.740 --> 2:32:22.660]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy. Is it true?
[2:32:24.500 --> 2:32:29.860]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless
[2:32:30.340 --> 2:32:35.860]  they need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because
[2:32:35.860 --> 2:32:42.180]  They know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser
[2:32:42.500 --> 2:32:47.860]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars on the air now more than ever because even you don't believe in god
[2:32:48.420 --> 2:32:55.220]  What the globalists are manifesting and setting up is jay chenna and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast
[2:32:55.220 --> 2:32:57.220]  They just announced
[2:32:57.220 --> 2:33:06.660]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:33:46.980 --> 2:33:49.860]  So dr. Wakefield you already moved past your new film
[2:33:50.420 --> 2:33:55.700]  Infertility a diabolical agenda and want to get into the future stuff you're talking about the numbers coming out now
[2:33:55.700 --> 2:34:00.420]  But I want to play this trailer tell us again about this film millions of people are watching right now
[2:34:00.420 --> 2:34:04.100]  They just go get the free film if they just share it we can save a lot of lives here
[2:34:04.100 --> 2:34:10.260]  This is an admitted caught red-handed un depopulation program. Yep get it out far and wide everybody
[2:34:10.260 --> 2:34:16.820]  You know it's an extraordinary film. It's 30 minutes. It's easy watching. It's it really is a remarkable story and
[2:34:18.020 --> 2:34:23.780]  I was very proud to be part of it. So please take a look at it and it really changed my mind
[2:34:23.780 --> 2:34:31.060]  On this whole issue of is there a depopulation agenda and the answer is categorically yes, and of course
[2:34:31.460 --> 2:34:35.220]  It's got far worse when tony fauchy goes out there and says of the
[2:34:35.700 --> 2:34:41.380]  Covid shots. There is absolutely no evidence none whatsoever that this can affect fertility
[2:34:41.860 --> 2:34:45.860]  What he doesn't tell you is that is based upon the fact that there's been no science behind it
[2:34:46.420 --> 2:34:49.380]  when that science is done for example the study
[2:34:50.260 --> 2:34:52.260]  in israel of
[2:34:52.260 --> 2:34:56.820]  sperm counts in sperm donors before and after the vaccine a very good study
[2:34:57.300 --> 2:35:03.300]  Following the same individuals over time it shows a significant form fall in sperm count and motility
[2:35:03.700 --> 2:35:08.660]  That is really worrying. Why because it comes against the background of a massively
[2:35:08.980 --> 2:35:13.220]  rapidly declining sperm count in men over the last 100 years anyway
[2:35:13.540 --> 2:35:18.020]  So as a threat to an existential threat to mankind, it's huge
[2:35:18.020 --> 2:35:22.900]  Incredible. Let's go ahead and play the trailer for infertility a diabolical agenda here it is
[2:35:29.940 --> 2:35:38.180]  It's really sad when you see pharmaceutical industry and people interested in profit and maybe other things like population control
[2:35:39.220 --> 2:35:41.220]  actually
[2:35:41.300 --> 2:35:45.860]  Injuring people on on on purpose to achieve their ends
[2:35:45.860 --> 2:35:47.860]  to imagine
[2:35:49.540 --> 2:35:56.420]  That a system somewhere some people somewhere are behind
[2:35:58.340 --> 2:36:01.780]  My inability to carry pregnancy to term
[2:36:03.780 --> 2:36:06.500]  That is a diabolical agenda
[2:36:07.620 --> 2:36:11.780]  And a war to them because as long as i'm here alive in this world
[2:36:11.780 --> 2:36:15.380]  They bring in a vaccine here. I will
[2:36:16.180 --> 2:36:18.180]  hunt it down
[2:36:18.420 --> 2:36:20.100]  analyze it
[2:36:20.100 --> 2:36:22.660]  And tell the kenyan people what it is
[2:36:26.420 --> 2:36:30.340]  In a story that is reminiscent of Jean Le Carre's the constant gardener
[2:36:31.060 --> 2:36:33.380]  On april 29th 2021
[2:36:34.020 --> 2:36:36.020]  Dr. Karanja was killed
[2:36:36.020 --> 2:36:42.020]  Officially by the SARS-CoV-2 virus
[2:36:42.180 --> 2:36:46.340]  The late dr. Karanja had a message for the rest of the world
[2:36:48.180 --> 2:36:51.460]  When they are through with africa, they're coming for you
[2:36:53.140 --> 2:36:57.860]  Keep your children ready. They will come for them and they'll come for you
[2:37:00.340 --> 2:37:04.420]  And right now in europe and the united states are funding black supremacists to mow down
[2:37:04.420 --> 2:37:06.820]  The mass shootings of white people every day
[2:37:08.100 --> 2:37:11.540]  This is part of a larger plan shame on those people that have done this
[2:37:11.780 --> 2:37:15.060]  We're all in human community and we're standing against this right now
[2:37:15.140 --> 2:37:19.460]  We can see what they're doing that are wakefield. We can and i i want to reassure people alex
[2:37:19.460 --> 2:37:23.540]  This is very very important is that people think we're losing. We're losing. This is terrible
[2:37:23.540 --> 2:37:25.220]  We're in a terrible situation
[2:37:25.220 --> 2:37:31.060]  What you have to understand is the history when i first got involved in this as i say five to ten people a handful of
[2:37:31.060 --> 2:37:34.900]  People around the world but were prepared to discuss the issue of vaccine safety now
[2:37:34.900 --> 2:37:38.500]  It's the majority of the adult population of the world
[2:37:39.220 --> 2:37:42.660]  There is a massive movement towards health freedom
[2:37:43.140 --> 2:37:49.860]  Towards concerns over vaccines and vaccine safety as well as other pharmaceuticals as to the nefarious practices
[2:37:50.260 --> 2:37:56.820]  Of the pharmaceutical companies of their close ties with government officials and the agencies like the fda that are there
[2:37:57.300 --> 2:37:59.300]  supposedly to regulate them so
[2:37:59.300 --> 2:38:00.740]  We are
[2:38:00.740 --> 2:38:08.420]  Prevailing we are winning our people need to take that message away and push harder push harder because it's really going to turn around very quick
[2:38:08.420 --> 2:38:09.620]  I know you only follow science
[2:38:09.620 --> 2:38:15.860]  But what is this lust of the globalist while they pose as liberals and try to put blacks in positions of liberal leadership
[2:38:15.860 --> 2:38:20.660]  It's all the agenda like black lives matter, but they really hate black people. Do we know why that is?
[2:38:22.260 --> 2:38:23.220]  I don't know
[2:38:23.220 --> 2:38:29.140]  And it's it's a question i've wanted to ask them all along and people say for example with the vaccine issue
[2:38:29.140 --> 2:38:30.580]  How could they do this?
[2:38:30.580 --> 2:38:35.940]  Surely they couldn't surely the cdc wouldn't fake data that would put children at risk of serious injury
[2:38:36.980 --> 2:38:42.020]  And why do they do it and that's not a question for me the question is for them and i'd love to pose it to them
[2:38:42.340 --> 2:38:45.460]  Why did you do it? What led you to do this, you know throughout history?
[2:38:45.460 --> 2:38:49.060]  We've said how could people do this? How could the nuts behave in the way they
[2:38:49.060 --> 2:38:53.780]  And that's a question i'd love to put to them because i do not understand how anyone with an
[2:38:53.780 --> 2:38:57.460]  And again the average black americans voting republican voting patriot doesn't mean that
[2:38:57.940 --> 2:39:00.180]  Trump's perfect, but they're they're they're waking up
[2:39:00.820 --> 2:39:03.220]  But then you have the left saying we love black people
[2:39:03.220 --> 2:39:07.460]  But all they do is try to destroy them and then get them to do bad things so we hate them
[2:39:08.420 --> 2:39:14.580]  Yes, and it and to divide a population divided in so many ways and people talk about unity
[2:39:14.580 --> 2:39:19.220]  There is a disparity what that's one of the strengths of this country is the diversity of the country?
[2:39:19.220 --> 2:39:24.340]  There is this hybrid vigor in america that has come from all of these people coming from around the world
[2:39:24.660 --> 2:39:28.820]  To create an extra folks that don't know that in any animal a hybrid is stronger
[2:39:30.260 --> 2:39:31.860]  Like an inbred queen of england that's right
[2:39:31.860 --> 2:39:37.540]  This concept of hybrid vigor is intermixing to the point where the best genes get selected and you have
[2:39:38.100 --> 2:39:40.900]  you know the strongest healthiest people and
[2:39:40.900 --> 2:39:47.780]  And and so we have this hybrid vigor in america because precisely because people have come in from all over the world
[2:39:48.180 --> 2:39:54.660]  And have made their homes here and have created this hybrid vigor the six there's an attack on an american dream
[2:39:54.820 --> 2:39:59.860]  Yeah, absolutely, which they pose as they're claiming they're no they're creating division. They're not creating unity
[2:40:00.100 --> 2:40:05.140]  No, they're creating division and you see it all the time. I mean just joe biden's speech the other day
[2:40:05.140 --> 2:40:07.140]  It was so manifestly obvious
[2:40:07.140 --> 2:40:12.660]  But it was like red background declaring war on his political enemies saying they're violent. He did it again last night
[2:40:13.220 --> 2:40:14.980]  Yeah, and I and I I'm an outsider
[2:40:14.980 --> 2:40:21.380]  I come into this country as a an immigrant someone who came in in sort of political and professional exile from the uk
[2:40:21.860 --> 2:40:27.860]  And I've thrived and I love this country. It's a great country and to hear biden talking about
[2:40:28.500 --> 2:40:30.500]  Trump supporters as though they are
[2:40:31.300 --> 2:40:36.580]  Uh terrorists, he says they're hitler while he's on a hitler background nighttime rally red light
[2:40:36.580 --> 2:40:40.180]  That settler. Yeah, you and I have been around the country talking at meetings with
[2:40:40.660 --> 2:40:42.820]  general mike flinn and others and and
[2:40:42.820 --> 2:40:46.580]  There are people there that that church that auditorium is packed
[2:40:47.300 --> 2:40:52.980]  With patriotic americans. There's not another every color and that's what scares them. There's not hate amongst them
[2:40:52.980 --> 2:40:54.500]  They're they're black. They're white
[2:40:54.500 --> 2:41:00.580]  They're all kinds of people there and they've come because they share a vision of what this country is and what should
[2:41:01.300 --> 2:41:05.140]  Seek to continue to be I think we're winning though. There's a lot of casualties
[2:41:05.140 --> 2:41:09.220]  Do you disagree with that and a and then b again? I said this earlier, but
[2:41:09.940 --> 2:41:14.100]  How does the enemy strike back? I keep saying that because they're not going to give up. They're losing right now
[2:41:14.100 --> 2:41:15.780]  But they're not going to give up
[2:41:15.780 --> 2:41:20.340]  Yes, we've seen them attack us in the media. We've seen them take us off social media. We've seen them
[2:41:21.060 --> 2:41:22.580]  really, uh
[2:41:22.580 --> 2:41:24.100]  push their
[2:41:24.100 --> 2:41:28.100]  Agenda as hard as they possibly can. I wonder where they will come next
[2:41:28.180 --> 2:41:31.060]  I mean can they and this is one of the reasons I make film now
[2:41:31.060 --> 2:41:36.340]  I just said film is a way of getting messy of crucial. That's the most powerful. Yeah, the most powerful way
[2:41:36.820 --> 2:41:40.420]  And it because people american people in particular understand film
[2:41:41.060 --> 2:41:44.500]  And you entertain them and you educate them second, but you entertain them first
[2:41:44.820 --> 2:41:48.660]  They get them sitting there sitting forward in their seats wanting to watch more wanting to know more
[2:41:49.060 --> 2:41:52.900]  And you've got an audience so as long as you're honest with them and you tell them the truth
[2:41:53.460 --> 2:41:55.460]  Then uh, you're going to change minds
[2:41:56.180 --> 2:41:57.620]  Well, that's why your story
[2:41:57.620 --> 2:42:04.500]  I don't even talk about yourself, but your story of being telling the truth demonized destroyed rebuilt is really the redemption story
[2:42:05.380 --> 2:42:10.500]  It does I remember telling you Alex years ago that time that it really changed for me when I was down in west texas in
[2:42:10.980 --> 2:42:12.340]  bandera and it was
[2:42:12.340 --> 2:42:14.020]  Dead of night stars absolute
[2:42:14.020 --> 2:42:19.780]  I looked up at the sky and there was just millions and billions and billions of stars and I suddenly thought you know what?
[2:42:20.340 --> 2:42:23.780]  This isn't about me at all the universe really doesn't care terribly much
[2:42:23.780 --> 2:42:30.500]  What happens to Andy wakefield it's about something much much more important and that moment really changed everything for me because when I realized
[2:42:31.060 --> 2:42:34.420]  That it wasn't about me. It wasn't personal. It was about something much more important
[2:42:34.980 --> 2:42:39.140]  Then it was a huge weight off my shoulders a huge burden off my shoulders and I could continue
[2:42:39.460 --> 2:42:43.220]  Didn't matter what they said about me. I could continue doing the work with a
[2:42:44.820 --> 2:42:50.340]  A good heart with a free sort of conscience beautiful dr. Andrew wakefield final segment straight ahead

[2:44:56.500 --> 2:45:05.060]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans. They financed major universities. They ran full page stories and
[2:45:05.860 --> 2:45:09.540]  Advertisements pushing their propaganda of the new york times other major newspapers
[2:45:10.100 --> 2:45:12.420]  That the family as we know it is a bad thing
[2:45:13.060 --> 2:45:18.020]  It must be ended and the first step in that is getting women out of the household teaching
[2:45:18.580 --> 2:45:23.460]  Women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing
[2:45:23.460 --> 2:45:28.420]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter my four national daughter
[2:45:28.500 --> 2:45:31.940]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well. I love to make breakfast
[2:45:32.580 --> 2:45:36.740]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be
[2:45:37.220 --> 2:45:40.740]  Nurture tips and then all sit down together and have the communal event
[2:45:41.460 --> 2:45:49.220]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding is our normal biological actions and coming together. They really are sick
[2:45:49.780 --> 2:45:52.820]  evil scientific cult of filth and want to domesticate us
[2:45:52.820 --> 2:45:56.180]  And turn us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue
[2:45:57.060 --> 2:45:59.060]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria
[2:45:59.140 --> 2:46:03.300]  Or pump gas or whether you're a farmer a rancher a doctor a lawyer or a millionaire
[2:46:03.540 --> 2:46:09.940]  Fortune and money magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year 30 different tax returns 30 different answers
[2:46:10.260 --> 2:46:14.660]  50 different tax returns 50 different answers and almost all of them just
[2:46:15.220 --> 2:46:19.860]  Screw you over especially the big firms and the big tax groups because they're part of the system
[2:46:19.860 --> 2:46:23.300]  And they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this show
[2:46:23.620 --> 2:46:28.020]  It's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[2:46:28.820 --> 2:46:34.340]  To be able to do things tax wise. It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your money
[2:46:34.340 --> 2:46:38.660]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years

[2:47:13.380 --> 2:47:23.940]  Final segment with dr. Andrew Wakefield totally vindicated the new film infertility a diabolical agenda
[2:47:24.100 --> 2:47:27.060]  But you've got not just this film's website will put on screen
[2:47:27.620 --> 2:47:30.740]  But your own website such critical information how people find it

[2:47:40.500 --> 2:47:43.060]  download them

[2:47:47.620 --> 2:47:51.220]  It's like the spring times the time to plant the human mind is ready for liberation
[2:47:51.220 --> 2:47:54.340]  So I'm gonna try to shut the last 10 minutes. You've got the floor to cover whatever you want
[2:47:54.580 --> 2:47:59.540]  But you asked me a question Alex about what will they do next? How will the empire?
[2:48:00.340 --> 2:48:02.660]  Strike back and I didn't have an immediate answer
[2:48:02.660 --> 2:48:05.700]  But I think you highlighted one of those ways and that is
[2:48:05.700 --> 2:48:11.460]  Through the use of pandemics through the use people are terrified of infection. They don't understand it
[2:48:11.700 --> 2:48:13.700]  they don't understand what was coming and
[2:48:14.500 --> 2:48:18.340]  They're easily manipulated in those circumstances particular people who have
[2:48:19.380 --> 2:48:22.420]  Trusted the man in the white coat for a very long time elderly people
[2:48:22.420 --> 2:48:25.540]  We're gonna do what we're told because that's what the doctor tells us to do
[2:48:26.180 --> 2:48:29.780]  And it's that's a terrifying situation. So what will happen next?
[2:48:30.180 --> 2:48:33.220]  Well, you've you've highlighted the possibility that they're gonna use another
[2:48:33.220 --> 2:48:39.380]  Infectious agent another pandemic to instill fear into the global population again, and I think that
[2:48:40.260 --> 2:48:43.060]  Maybe the way that they'll go about it. What I think it will fail
[2:48:43.540 --> 2:48:46.580]  I think it will fail just as monkey pox vaccines are failing
[2:48:47.140 --> 2:48:50.900]  Just as the that narrative is going down the tubes because
[2:48:51.540 --> 2:48:57.060]  People don't believe them anymore people do not trust them and part of their initiative one death. I mean us. Oh, yeah
[2:48:57.060 --> 2:49:03.140]  It's it's ridiculous and their initiative now is to understand the mindset of those who are
[2:49:03.860 --> 2:49:09.060]  Vaccine resistant those who are reluctant and they spend millions of dollars trying to analyze them
[2:49:09.060 --> 2:49:14.900]  So this last attack is like a beta test. They never come to us and say why are you concerned about vaccine safety?
[2:49:14.900 --> 2:49:19.780]  And I could deliver them the facts that never happens. It never happens. They assume that we're just
[2:49:20.580 --> 2:49:22.260]  ill educated
[2:49:22.260 --> 2:49:27.300]  Vacces who know I spent 30 years studying if something protected me I take it every day
[2:49:27.540 --> 2:49:31.300]  Absolutely if it was safe and if it was effective you would take it every day
[2:49:31.300 --> 2:49:34.580]  And I think that the new movie that we're making now really
[2:49:36.020 --> 2:49:40.420]  Hammers home on this safe and effective narrative in the biggest way
[2:49:41.380 --> 2:49:43.780]  It's going to be very exciting. It's going to cause
[2:49:43.780 --> 2:49:51.540]  No doubt a great deal of trouble in certain quarters, but it's the truth and our job is to get the truth out there
[2:49:52.980 --> 2:49:54.980]  How if the whole things blow up their face
[2:49:55.620 --> 2:50:00.420]  And all these lawsuits are starting and we know there's secret agreements and not attend dying at triple jab
[2:50:00.420 --> 2:50:04.180]  How do they get out of this like why would they do something so crazy? I don't think they do
[2:50:04.420 --> 2:50:08.820]  I think that it when you look at it what you've got executives within the companies
[2:50:09.300 --> 2:50:10.820]  They don't care. They've made their money
[2:50:10.820 --> 2:50:14.180]  I think there have been five billionaires who've come out of Moderna already
[2:50:14.260 --> 2:50:19.220]  I mean, I think Pfizer has made a hundred billion. Yeah, and they move on the ball though. They they're interested in their stock price
[2:50:19.300 --> 2:50:26.420]  They're satisfying their stockholders making their bonuses and moving on so they don't care what the long term for these vaccines is
[2:50:26.740 --> 2:50:32.020]  That's not their issue. They're not liable for safety issues. And so they move on they'll move on to the next one
[2:50:32.580 --> 2:50:33.700]  and
[2:50:33.700 --> 2:50:37.380]  It really is left for the people to pick up the pieces the people who've
[2:50:37.380 --> 2:50:44.740]  Been jabbed who why not put out sugar water and still make your hundred billion instead kill a bunch of people and make enemies
[2:50:44.980 --> 2:50:47.540]  Yes, I don't understand why they've gone about it in this way
[2:50:47.620 --> 2:50:52.420]  It is I think it will turn out to be the biggest mistake they've ever made and and you again
[2:50:52.420 --> 2:50:56.020]  You pointed out earlier that people like dr. Peter McCullough one of the most published
[2:50:56.500 --> 2:51:01.140]  Physicians in North America changing sides coming over and saying no, this is wrong people
[2:51:01.780 --> 2:51:04.660]  A lot of major major scientists physicians
[2:51:04.660 --> 2:51:11.060]  Health care staff coming over to our side and saying this is wrong and what those people will come to realize in time
[2:51:11.700 --> 2:51:14.660]  Is that it didn't start with this shot the covid shot?
[2:51:14.660 --> 2:51:16.660]  It started a long time ago
[2:51:16.660 --> 2:51:21.780]  With the pediatric vaccine schedule and that is the message that we will be bringing to people
[2:51:22.180 --> 2:51:24.820]  In the next move. Well, that was the numbers. I saw is that
[2:51:25.460 --> 2:51:32.260]  Record low uptake in in modern history of the shots. They've just like remember three years ago in
[2:51:32.260 --> 2:51:35.700]  December of 2019
[2:51:36.100 --> 2:51:42.740]  They had that big un meeting on vaccine efficacy in switzerland. We played the clips here. They said our doctors don't believe it
[2:51:42.740 --> 2:51:44.660]  It's killing people. It's not working
[2:51:44.660 --> 2:51:47.700]  Everybody's against us. So they double down and do it again
[2:51:48.340 --> 2:51:52.340]  Now they have to completely destroyed any credibility of any vaccines
[2:51:52.980 --> 2:51:58.980]  They have and they've only got themselves to blame. You see what they do is they label people as anti-vaccine. I'm not anti-vaccine
[2:51:58.980 --> 2:52:05.220]  What I am is pro. I'm pro good science. I'm pro informed consent. I'm pro doing the job right
[2:52:05.300 --> 2:52:10.820]  I'm pro parents being able to make the right decisions the right health care choices for themselves and their children
[2:52:11.060 --> 2:52:18.260]  That's what I'm about. I'm pro this label of anti-vaxxers is really just something that is conveniently put out there in the media
[2:52:18.340 --> 2:52:25.460]  Like conspiracy theories that just puts you in a bracket and we don't need to take any notice of them because they're anti-vaxxers
[2:52:25.460 --> 2:52:32.660]  No, we've been pushing for good science throughout and that is what we will continue to so what comes next because again
[2:52:32.980 --> 2:52:37.860]  If they had an anti flu shot that didn't have a bunch of side effects or they were honest about it little side effect
[2:52:38.260 --> 2:52:42.980]  Had studies and I don't know what the flu. I'll take it if they had something that worked. I'm all for it
[2:52:43.620 --> 2:52:46.100]  Why put out a bad product and then try to cover it up?
[2:52:47.300 --> 2:52:49.300]  Yeah, I think fundamentally the whole
[2:52:49.540 --> 2:52:50.740]  principle of
[2:52:50.740 --> 2:52:56.900]  Giving someone a vaccine let's say a respiratory virus like measles that we caught through the oral route that we breathed in
[2:52:57.540 --> 2:53:02.740]  Is now being injected into the skin change the biology of that virus completely in terms of
[2:53:03.300 --> 2:53:06.580]  the way the body saw it the way the body handled it and
[2:53:07.540 --> 2:53:10.500]  It was assumed and this is the problem. It was assumed that it would be okay
[2:53:10.820 --> 2:53:14.340]  There is another assumption. I would just want to talk about Alex. I hope we got time
[2:53:14.900 --> 2:53:17.060]  And that is comes back to this infertility issue
[2:53:17.060 --> 2:53:22.660]  Is that a doctor got up a Canadian scientist who was a vaccinologist and he said we've made a huge mistake
[2:53:23.300 --> 2:53:24.740]  when we
[2:53:24.740 --> 2:53:29.700]  Developed this vaccine. We assumed that when we injected it it would remain at the site of injection
[2:53:30.660 --> 2:53:36.580]  We assumed based upon our knowledge of childhood vaccines doing the same. No, they don't no one's ever done those studies
[2:53:36.820 --> 2:53:38.100]  That was the first
[2:53:38.100 --> 2:53:43.140]  Misconception is that no one's ever looked at the childhood vaccine to see if they stay in at the site of injection
[2:53:43.140 --> 2:53:46.980]  No, they go out throughout the body. He said the big mistake we made is we made that assumption
[2:53:46.980 --> 2:53:53.060]  But they made that assumption on behalf of seven billion people the world's population who they intended to vaccinate
[2:53:53.300 --> 2:53:54.660]  They then find
[2:53:54.660 --> 2:53:58.100]  After giving the vaccine that it doesn't remain at the site of injection
[2:53:58.260 --> 2:54:02.340]  It goes throughout the body and it binds specifically to certain things like the ovaries
[2:54:02.980 --> 2:54:09.060]  And where it will produce inflammation and autoimmune attack and it will render some women infertile the same with men
[2:54:09.620 --> 2:54:11.620]  the test is and and so
[2:54:11.620 --> 2:54:15.140]  You cannot make assumptions on behalf of the entire world population
[2:54:15.460 --> 2:54:19.780]  That it's going to behave in the way you want it to behave because it won't because I mean I take a clip
[2:54:19.780 --> 2:54:25.380]  I played last week the head of Pfizer saying I didn't believe in mRNA, but my scientists came and said they thought it would work
[2:54:25.380 --> 2:54:27.380]  So I did it. It's like gambling
[2:54:28.500 --> 2:54:30.500]  It's an experiment. It's never been done before
[2:54:30.820 --> 2:54:32.820]  It's it's a huge failure and it's
[2:54:33.380 --> 2:54:39.620]  Throwing up all kinds of complications and the irony of all of this is people are getting sick and of course they need pharmaceutical
[2:54:39.620 --> 2:54:41.380]  products
[2:54:41.380 --> 2:54:46.580]  To treat this and it's obviously pretty meditated. So it makes money at the front end and the back end. It is just you know
[2:54:46.580 --> 2:54:49.780]  Yeah, it's obviously for meditators. Let me ask you this in closing. How does it?
[2:54:50.340 --> 2:54:54.340]  You don't want to speculate but gut level. How does it in for them? I think they've jumped the shark
[2:54:54.660 --> 2:54:57.540]  I think they've gone too far. How do you see it currently?
[2:54:58.100 --> 2:55:00.100]  Ending for what big farm was done?
[2:55:00.100 --> 2:55:03.860]  I think that there will be a lot of litigation that will bring a lot of attention to this issue
[2:55:04.260 --> 2:55:07.380]  They will may well try and push another pandemic agenda
[2:55:07.380 --> 2:55:12.660]  Uh, it will fail and people are waking up. I agree and the CEOs move on with the money
[2:55:12.660 --> 2:55:20.180]  They don't care what happens. They don't care. They don't care. And so our job is to keep getting that information out there making the films telling the stories
[2:55:20.580 --> 2:55:21.620]  and
[2:55:21.620 --> 2:55:23.620]  Winning progressively winning over
[2:55:23.940 --> 2:55:28.420]  The right thinking people and we are winning. We are winning that you talk about the numbers. I mean
[2:55:29.060 --> 2:55:33.940]  You were like five scientists 25 years ago. Now. It's I mean the tides on your side
[2:55:33.940 --> 2:55:37.460]  Oh, yeah, more than half the world's adult population have now said
[2:55:38.340 --> 2:55:42.020]  We do not believe this vaccine is either safe or effective or necessary
[2:55:42.740 --> 2:55:48.020]  And you've lied to us and we're not touching it. Thank you. Well, that's what that head of the un vaccine program
[2:55:48.020 --> 2:55:52.260]  We showed on screen earlier. She said three years ago. She said no one trusts us
[2:55:52.820 --> 2:55:54.820]  Our scientists our doctors don't believe us
[2:55:55.300 --> 2:55:59.140]  No one's ever gonna take vaccines again and then they double down. It's it's crazy
[2:55:59.140 --> 2:56:03.780]  They have nowhere to go Alex. They have nowhere to go and once you start to lie
[2:56:04.820 --> 2:56:08.260]  There's no way out. Once you start to commit scientific fraud. There's no way out
[2:56:08.340 --> 2:56:12.500]  It just gets worse. You have to keep covering up the last mistake the last lie you told
[2:56:13.140 --> 2:56:17.700]  And it just eventually the public turn around say enough and that's what's happening now
[2:56:18.420 --> 2:56:23.300]  So we think of evil people at least I do like super villains. They're invincible. They're really not they're really a joke
[2:56:23.460 --> 2:56:28.500]  It's like Hitler attacking north africa and poland and france and england and russia like what was he thinking?
[2:56:28.500 --> 2:56:31.540]  He's just a mad dog. I mean, they're just mad dogs
[2:56:32.420 --> 2:56:39.140]  Yeah, I think they they're motivated by certain things. Some have this grand scientific agenda. Some it's pure profit
[2:56:39.620 --> 2:56:44.980]  Some we'll never know but there is this sort of corporate mentality that well, he's doing it
[2:56:44.980 --> 2:56:49.940]  So I'll do it. He told me to do it. So I'm okay doing it. No, I feel protected from liability
[2:56:50.020 --> 2:56:54.420]  I've got to take personal responsibility as well as corporate responsibility for their actions
[2:56:54.420 --> 2:56:59.620]  And if they don't do that and people get hurt, then they're gonna pay a price and that's the answer holding them responsible
[2:56:59.940 --> 2:57:04.820]  Infertility a diabolical agenda. The free film is out right now. We'll put that url
[2:57:05.460 --> 2:57:10.020]  Onscreen for tv viewers and dr. Wakefield. Thank you so much for all you've done

[2:57:46.340 --> 2:57:50.900]  People ask me all the time. What is your best at roping? You've got turbo force
[2:57:50.900 --> 2:57:56.180]  You've got brain force plus and you've got brain force ultra. Which one is better?
[2:57:56.980 --> 2:57:58.980]  and that's like asking
[2:57:59.060 --> 2:58:01.060]  What's better a forward f-150
[2:58:01.860 --> 2:58:03.460]  or a Cadillac
[2:58:03.460 --> 2:58:05.460]  or a Ferrari
[2:58:05.860 --> 2:58:10.580]  It's different strokes for different folks. It varies all through different formulas
[2:58:11.300 --> 2:58:15.220]  All three do different things turbo force is 10 hours of clean
[2:58:15.940 --> 2:58:18.980]  Out of control energy. I can't even take a whole pack myself
[2:58:18.980 --> 2:58:27.220]  Brain force plus is a long-term acting clean. Neutrophic. This brain force ultra is a super fast acting
[2:58:28.020 --> 2:58:29.780]  Neutropic that
[2:58:29.780 --> 2:58:32.340]  Creates incredible clarity, but doesn't last very long
[2:58:32.660 --> 2:58:40.660]  They're all three different formulas and finally back in stock massively discounted brain force ultra is available at infowarstore.com
[2:58:41.860 --> 2:58:44.740]  Brain force ultra back in stock infowarstore.com
[2:58:44.740 --> 2:58:46.740]  Now
[2:58:48.580 --> 2:58:55.060]  Are great a bag of it here. I mean this is from people say why is it from Chiapas, Mexico the communist?
[2:58:55.300 --> 2:58:58.820]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[2:58:59.060 --> 2:59:02.980]  Above organic in the volcanic soil better than guatemalan coffee and yeah
[2:59:03.140 --> 2:59:06.180]  We buy it from the little farmers that you know the media calls communist
[2:59:06.180 --> 2:59:10.340]  But really they're just a commune and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it
[2:59:10.420 --> 2:59:12.580]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over
[2:59:12.580 --> 2:59:17.060]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up
[2:59:17.060 --> 2:59:22.820]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more for pound and I just think it's some of the best coffee
[2:59:22.820 --> 2:59:27.460]  You're gonna find anywhere. It's wake up america patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally
[2:59:27.940 --> 2:59:29.940]  um in fact, I'm gonna tell you a little story
[2:59:31.060 --> 2:59:32.900]  um
[2:59:32.900 --> 2:59:34.340]  Yeah, I like that
[2:59:34.340 --> 2:59:40.820]  I think you want to believe it anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't find us
[2:59:40.820 --> 2:59:42.820]  You don't want to see that's fine
[2:59:42.820 --> 3:00:04.260]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
[3:00:33.140 --> 3:00:37.060]  Coming up in about three months, it's gonna be 29 years. I've been on air
[3:00:37.780 --> 3:00:38.820]  and
[3:00:38.820 --> 3:00:41.700]  It's all about the people. It's all about humanity. It's all about
[3:00:41.700 --> 3:00:47.060]  Resistance and it's so empowering. It's so amazing. We have a guest host. It's about to take over
[3:00:48.420 --> 3:00:53.780]  But I I mean I got to tell you just quite frankly to listeners before jay dyer takes over
[3:00:54.340 --> 3:00:56.340]  That I am extremely proud
[3:00:56.900 --> 3:01:00.820]  To be on air with you here today and I'm extremely blessed to be here with you
[3:01:01.860 --> 3:01:03.860]  and
[3:01:03.940 --> 3:01:05.540]  We are
[3:01:05.540 --> 3:01:08.420]  We gods always had this work like the widows might
[3:01:08.420 --> 3:01:10.980]  We are always right on the edge of destruction
[3:01:12.260 --> 3:01:14.580]  And that's how God shows us that God's in charge
[3:01:15.220 --> 3:01:17.220]  But God works through you
[3:01:17.300 --> 3:01:19.300]  So I want to ask all of you today
[3:01:19.300 --> 3:01:26.180]  Whether it was the steve man interview that was unbelievably powerful or the andrew tate information that was incredibly important
[3:01:26.820 --> 3:01:31.380]  Or whether it was andrew wakefield that is about the very destiny and essence of human life on this planet
[3:01:32.740 --> 3:01:37.620]  The only way these emergency messages these sos transmissions get out is you
[3:01:37.620 --> 3:01:41.380]  And I believe in you. I know you're incredible. I know you took us here
[3:01:41.540 --> 3:01:46.260]  I don't sit and look at the mirror and go Alex Jones. You're this incredible person. Uh, you know, I go man
[3:01:46.260 --> 3:01:50.180]  I got to fight harder and God's watching me and thank God for my listeners
[3:01:50.740 --> 3:01:54.660]  And that's why my listeners calling and say, oh Alex, you're so great. Oh, you're so wonderful. I love you so much
[3:01:54.660 --> 3:01:56.660]  I just say shut up
[3:01:56.980 --> 3:02:02.980]  You love freedom. I love freedom. We're together. I need you. You need me like a life raft in the middle of the ocean
[3:02:02.980 --> 3:02:10.100]  It's not about thanking each other. That's not bad. I get I love you. You love me. We are literally in a war
[3:02:11.380 --> 3:02:18.980]  This isn't about being heroes and it's not about how cool we are. It's about gamut. We are powerful together
[3:02:20.740 --> 3:02:27.220]  That's why I hate them brainwashing and financing black supremacists all over the country just machine gunning white people
[3:02:27.220 --> 3:02:33.300]  And as a white person, yeah, I don't like that. I don't like black people being machine gunned or killed with their babies
[3:02:33.860 --> 3:02:36.260]  We're all together and this is BS
[3:02:36.900 --> 3:02:38.900]  This is a lie
[3:02:39.140 --> 3:02:41.140]  It's a lie
[3:02:41.140 --> 3:02:46.260]  And I believe in you. We've got to beat these people. We've got to get wise to what they're doing. So
[3:02:50.340 --> 3:02:52.340]  God always keeps me in this position
[3:02:52.340 --> 3:02:57.780]  And I'm not gonna attack God. I love God, but it is frustrating. So it's on God
[3:02:57.860 --> 3:03:00.340]  Why do you always keep you right on the edge of being shut down?
[3:03:00.820 --> 3:03:06.020]  Why do you always keep me right on the edge of not being on air and God's like because that keeps your ass on your toes, boy
[3:03:06.740 --> 3:03:08.740]  That's why
[3:03:08.820 --> 3:03:10.980]  It's only when you're in your ass kicked that you're strong
[3:03:11.460 --> 3:03:14.420]  So I get God's plan. I'm not bitching about it. I get it
[3:03:14.900 --> 3:03:16.340]  but man
[3:03:16.340 --> 3:03:18.340]  I like to at least have 10 percent
[3:03:18.340 --> 3:03:23.380]  In the in the gas tank like I'd like to be just a little above the instead of always on E
[3:03:23.780 --> 3:03:27.300]  Like the other day I was driving around after work. I realized my gosh. I'm way below E
[3:03:27.300 --> 3:03:32.420]  I'm about to run out because I know my car it runs out after it gets down there. I was like hurry into a gas station
[3:03:32.660 --> 3:03:34.020]  I'm like, okay, God
[3:03:34.020 --> 3:03:36.020]  Can I just be a little above E all the time?
[3:03:36.340 --> 3:03:39.780]  But the way the universe works God goes no you're below E bitch
[3:03:40.660 --> 3:03:44.740]  Because you're gonna know right when it's all getting shut down. I do it again
[3:03:45.380 --> 3:03:47.380]  God that's how God works. It's just
[3:03:47.380 --> 3:03:51.140]  I love God. I appreciate God keeps keeps me on my toes, but

[3:04:51.140 --> 3:04:54.020]  We'll be right back with jay dyer straight ahead
[3:04:56.980 --> 3:04:58.980]  Donald Trump and the mighty republicans
[3:04:59.540 --> 3:05:04.660]  represented extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic
[3:05:05.140 --> 3:05:07.540]  I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have an operational name
[3:05:08.340 --> 3:05:09.540]  In fact, I bet it does
[3:05:09.540 --> 3:05:11.540]  I bet it's called operation
[3:05:12.100 --> 3:05:17.140]  Matador they see us as the bull and they are shaky a red flag
[3:05:17.540 --> 3:05:23.540]  In our face and the matador is the deep state with a long skinny razor sharp sword
[3:05:23.780 --> 3:05:31.540]  So that when the bull lunges forward the matador uses the force of its weight to drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape
[3:05:31.540 --> 3:05:34.180]  As the bull buries himself into the dust
[3:05:34.180 --> 3:05:37.780]  They've got the ace of spades in their hand, which is false wax
[3:05:37.780 --> 3:05:41.780]  Before you launch a war you stage false slags. That's the first thing you do
[3:05:41.780 --> 3:05:45.300]  Because nobody wants to say they started a war bad guys start wars
[3:05:45.540 --> 3:05:52.180]  So every time a war gets launched by bad guys, they stage an event. This is operation matador
[3:06:00.820 --> 3:06:05.940]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on your guest host jay dyer of jason ailsis
[3:06:05.940 --> 3:06:07.940]  And I'm glad to be back on this fourth hour
[3:06:07.940 --> 3:06:13.940]  You know, I uncovered some really fascinating things that back up a lot of the research that I've done in the last couple years
[3:06:13.940 --> 3:06:17.940]  and that ties in very closely with the death of the queen
[3:06:19.940 --> 3:06:23.940]  And uh, one of the books that I want to talk about that is kind of a forgotten text was
[3:06:23.940 --> 3:06:25.940]  back in 1981
[3:06:25.940 --> 3:06:33.940]  There was a futurist book that included a sort of an anthology of a bunch of the global elite writers everybody from Carl Rogers to Jonas
[3:06:33.940 --> 3:06:35.940]  Salk to Tim Leary
[3:06:35.940 --> 3:06:41.940]  To Marilyn Ferguson to many many others Barbara Marx Hubbard's all of whom were pushing
[3:06:41.940 --> 3:06:49.940]  The global elite ideas back in 1981 at that agent of change level right the culture pusher types of people
[3:06:49.940 --> 3:06:55.940]  And one of the fascinating chapters in this book again in 1981, which I did mention I think some years back
[3:06:55.940 --> 3:07:03.940]  Was by Willis Harmon who was one of the co publishers of another famous elite text the Stanford Research Institute changing images of man
[3:07:03.940 --> 3:07:11.940]  He wrote a famous piece in this book called millennium and millennium was about where we would be by our day
[3:07:11.940 --> 3:07:13.940]  Right where we are right now
[3:07:13.940 --> 3:07:19.940]  And this chapter is about what work would be like in the future and this is another one of those key texts for demonstrating
[3:07:19.940 --> 3:07:29.940]  Now the writings of the elite themselves had planned the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and maybe even 100 years into the future as best they could
[3:07:29.940 --> 3:07:31.940]  Doesn't mean that necessarily it will happen
[3:07:31.940 --> 3:07:35.940]  But from their vantage point that's where they intend to take things
[3:07:35.940 --> 3:07:37.940]  So Willis Harmon
[3:07:37.940 --> 3:07:39.940]  The white paper author
[3:07:39.940 --> 3:07:45.940]  Wrote up a paper in this about what work would be like in the future
[3:07:45.940 --> 3:07:50.940]  And one of the things he talks about is a term that you hear David Attenborough used to say all the time
[3:07:50.940 --> 3:07:53.940]  Well of course we've got the extra people
[3:07:53.940 --> 3:07:56.940]  What are we going to do with all the extra people?
[3:07:56.940 --> 3:08:01.940]  The extra people run about the world like little ants in an ant colony
[3:08:01.940 --> 3:08:03.940]  Perhaps we need to stump them out
[3:08:03.940 --> 3:08:06.940]  Literally that's what David Attenborough as you guys know probably
[3:08:06.940 --> 3:08:12.940]  Good friend of Prince Charles who recently passed away as well
[3:08:12.940 --> 3:08:18.940]  Talked about the extra people and the extra people are those who are not essential workers
[3:08:18.940 --> 3:08:28.940]  So this idea of essential and non-essential workers actually goes back to the 70s and 80s with the acceptance of various austerity doctrines on the part of the elite
[3:08:28.940 --> 3:08:33.940]  Now that had been kind of policy for a long time in the Anglo-American establishment at higher levels
[3:08:33.940 --> 3:08:37.940]  It had been the running program of the British Empire for hundreds of years
[3:08:37.940 --> 3:08:42.940]  At least going back to perhaps even the Elizabethan period
[3:08:42.940 --> 3:08:48.940]  Which I'm going to show you some interesting things that goes into the mythology of the British Empire when we look at Edmund Spencer
[3:08:48.940 --> 3:08:55.940]  All the way back to the fairy queen and Queen Elizabeth and her esoteric ideas about herself and the empire
[3:08:55.940 --> 3:09:01.940]  But if we fast forward to the 70s and 80s you have the acceptance of State Department memorandum 200
[3:09:01.940 --> 3:09:04.940]  The Kissinger document which deals with depopulation
[3:09:04.940 --> 3:09:11.940]  You have the acceptance in 1969 or 70 of the Bernard Barrelson Jaffe Memo
[3:09:11.940 --> 3:09:20.940]  Which if you look up the Jaffe Memo it deals with the introduction of the principles of the 60s sexual counterculture revolution into mass society
[3:09:20.940 --> 3:09:27.940]  So they're actually saying that what's going on in the counterculture revolution should be promoted on a mass scale to all of the west
[3:09:27.940 --> 3:09:33.940]  Why? Obviously for the purpose of discouraging population production
[3:09:33.940 --> 3:09:37.940]  Reducing the number getting it down to ZPG and then eventually negative growth rates
[3:09:37.940 --> 3:09:44.940]  So back to this Willis Harman paper after discussing the extra people or what he calls the pointless people
[3:09:44.940 --> 3:09:51.940]  He says that we're going to have to come up with different ideas to structure the way that we see work
[3:09:51.940 --> 3:09:59.940]  And in the dystopia in the technocratic era it will be a tiered system where there's essential and non-essential workers
[3:09:59.940 --> 3:10:05.940]  They already had essential and non-essential worker graft out back in the 70s and early 80s
[3:10:05.940 --> 3:10:10.940]  This is a 1981 text again people hit me up asking me where is that book all the time
[3:10:10.940 --> 3:10:16.940]  I don't know if it's still in print it's probably not I had it recommended to me by a really in depth researcher
[3:10:16.940 --> 3:10:21.940]  And I just happened to get one of the last copies and every time I talk about these global elite texts
[3:10:21.940 --> 3:10:27.940]  They go up hundreds of dollars on Amazon you can't get any more because most of these are actually out of print
[3:10:27.940 --> 3:10:33.940]  Well it goes on to talk about the structure of the American economy in different periods of big change
[3:10:33.940 --> 3:10:39.940]  So from the industrial revolution and then to the depression and then to the modernization of the American economy
[3:10:39.940 --> 3:10:46.940]  He says that the consumer model was done by design so transitioning America from the West
[3:10:46.940 --> 3:10:51.940]  From a production based economy to a consumerist based economy was by design
[3:10:51.940 --> 3:10:56.940]  And the introduction of the great society and the giant massive welfare programs were by design
[3:10:56.940 --> 3:11:00.940]  And thus you can see a pattern for example this is my commentary not Harman
[3:11:00.940 --> 3:11:07.940]  In the way that the government big daddy government treated the first American Indians giving them reservations
[3:11:07.940 --> 3:11:11.940]  And giving them welfare as a way not to help them but to control
[3:11:11.940 --> 3:11:16.940]  Then you see that same model applied to the black community to control them
[3:11:16.940 --> 3:11:21.940]  Now that model which was done on those two groups is now being done on everybody in the West
[3:11:21.940 --> 3:11:30.940]  So this is a studied research warfare plan intent on restructuring all of modern society
[3:11:30.940 --> 3:11:34.940]  Not just America not just the West but the entire globe
[3:11:34.940 --> 3:11:40.940]  That's why you saw in the last two years of the COOFID crisis all of these programs and policies were global now
[3:11:40.940 --> 3:11:44.940]  Oh you have elected officials doesn't matter now you listen to the UN
[3:11:44.940 --> 3:11:47.940]  Now you listen to the CDC now they tell you everything the CDC listens to the UN
[3:11:47.940 --> 3:11:51.940]  They listen to the Rockefeller Foundation and Gil Bates Foundation right
[3:11:51.940 --> 3:11:57.940]  And that's for the whole world showing that the structure for a proto global government is already in place
[3:11:57.940 --> 3:12:00.940]  And that was set up out of the 28th century's wars and the Cold War
[3:12:00.940 --> 3:12:05.940]  That was the whole point of those two world wars and the Cold War according to Dr. Quigley
[3:12:05.940 --> 3:12:15.940]  Was the resurrection of the dead Pax Britannia and the now dying Pax Americana into its third
[3:12:15.940 --> 3:12:25.940]  Snake skin shedding manifestation of the global order the technocratic great reset order
[3:12:25.940 --> 3:12:30.940]  Now Harman goes on in this essay to discuss the halting of growth
[3:12:30.940 --> 3:12:36.940]  He says that in the future growth will have to stop in terms of the economy we can't have boomers
[3:12:36.940 --> 3:12:42.940]  And the boomer mindset of ever expanding growth that has to be done away with again
[3:12:42.940 --> 3:12:47.940]  Remember even though they admit and take credit for the American economy exploding
[3:12:47.940 --> 3:12:53.940]  And the baby boom right they say oh this was actually done by design for one phase
[3:12:53.940 --> 3:12:59.940]  Then we will demonizing guilt trip everybody for consumerism which was sold from the top down
[3:12:59.940 --> 3:13:05.940]  Right the idea of deindustrialization was so that you could have a service economy and consumerism
[3:13:05.940 --> 3:13:10.940]  Now you're told that consumerism and service economy is evil bad destroying the planet
[3:13:10.940 --> 3:13:17.940]  But that's all a lie it's all a ruse to transition everybody into on the basis of a mass guilt trip
[3:13:17.940 --> 3:13:20.940]  A Malthusian technocracy
[3:13:20.940 --> 3:13:24.940]  So he says that we're going to have to understand that growth will be slowed and in the future
[3:13:24.940 --> 3:13:29.940]  Automatization will replace workers there won't be human workers
[3:13:29.940 --> 3:13:36.940]  I just saw the other day video clips of now in fruit fields there's no longer human workers
[3:13:36.940 --> 3:13:41.940]  That's now done by robots fast food is transitioning out to you just order from a robot
[3:13:41.940 --> 3:13:45.940]  Going into grocery stores and even convenience stores now it's all self checkout
[3:13:45.940 --> 3:13:48.940]  So there's not going to be checkout people anymore
[3:13:48.940 --> 3:13:53.940]  And this is under the guise of number one they'll say well it's ease and efficiency right
[3:13:53.940 --> 3:13:58.940]  That's what everything is sold as it saves energy it's more efficient
[3:13:58.940 --> 3:14:03.940]  Which there might be some truth to those things but then the payoff is even worse because
[3:14:03.940 --> 3:14:08.940]  Now what happens is we have all of these extra people according to the elites
[3:14:08.940 --> 3:14:13.940]  According to David Attenborough right World Wildlife Foundation all of Prince Charles's groups
[3:14:13.940 --> 3:14:19.940]  All of these royal society created groups and by the way Harmon wrote and worked with the Royal Society
[3:14:19.940 --> 3:14:21.940]  So keep that in mind
[3:14:21.940 --> 3:14:29.940]  He says that what we're going to have to have is a post industrial society based around austerity
[3:14:29.940 --> 3:14:33.940]  And shared circular borrowing
[3:14:33.940 --> 3:14:38.940]  So when you hear people at TED Talks like Eda Alkin promoted by Klaus the Royal Academy Forum
[3:14:38.940 --> 3:14:43.940]  When they talk about a circular economy they're talking about you not owning anything
[3:14:43.940 --> 3:14:45.940]  You will own nothing and you'll be happy
[3:14:45.940 --> 3:14:50.940]  The circular economy you will own nothing you will have to share the whitey tighties
[3:14:50.940 --> 3:14:53.940]  The underwear across your entire neighborhood
[3:14:53.940 --> 3:14:58.940]  When there will be one pair you will share it it will become dingy brown and you will have to share it anyway
[3:14:58.940 --> 3:15:01.940]  That's what Klaus says literally about his whitey tighties
[3:15:01.940 --> 3:15:06.940]  Not really he says that you will have a circular economy he says that you already have the Uber
[3:15:06.940 --> 3:15:10.940]  You have the Uber already therefore you've already accepted what I'm telling you about
[3:15:10.940 --> 3:15:15.940]  He literally does say that right so there was a fallacy right just because people use Uber doesn't mean that
[3:15:15.940 --> 3:15:23.940]  I've opted in now to a total communist technocracy where all people's property is shared
[3:15:23.940 --> 3:15:26.940]  I mean by the way wouldn't that include whitey tighties and underwear
[3:15:26.940 --> 3:15:29.940]  If you're not going to have any property you're not going to have underwear
[3:15:29.940 --> 3:15:32.940]  You're going to have to share it
[3:15:32.940 --> 3:15:41.940]  And so he says that post-industrial society will lead to communism by design and universal basic income back in 1981
[3:15:41.940 --> 3:15:47.940]  This is way ahead of its time and it literally talks about post-industrial society post-industrial
[3:15:47.940 --> 3:15:53.940]  Right that's austerity that's you going back to 1800s that's you going back to prairie little house on the prairie
[3:15:53.940 --> 3:15:56.940]  Don't go anywhere this is Dr. John Shaw I'm your associate lawyer
[3:15:56.940 --> 3:16:04.940]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food
[3:16:04.940 --> 3:16:12.940]  It's all come out and they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of God the creator and we are powerful
[3:16:12.940 --> 3:16:20.940]  And the social engineers fear that so much so that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy
[3:16:20.940 --> 3:16:28.940]  Is it true? The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless
[3:16:28.940 --> 3:16:37.940]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong
[3:16:37.940 --> 3:16:41.940]  And they know in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser
[3:16:41.940 --> 3:16:45.940]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep them full wars in the air now more than ever
[3:16:45.940 --> 3:16:51.940]  Because even if you don't believe in God what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe handling
[3:16:51.940 --> 3:16:55.940]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced

[3:20:54.940 --> 3:20:58.940]  Listen, that's not a joke, that is a joke, but it's not a joke, but it is a joke
[3:20:58.940 --> 3:21:11.940]  And that's because that's actually what's in this piece about the post-industrial society and austerity being brought in by design after catastrophes
[3:21:11.940 --> 3:21:19.940]  I wonder what catastrophes this great recent is the perfect excuse for us to bring in the new and the old
[3:21:19.940 --> 3:21:29.940]  So what is this going to look like? What is this circular economy that we keep hearing about? I'm going to get into more of that from the Millennium Essay from Willis Harmon
[3:21:29.940 --> 3:21:39.940]  In this technocratic society, how predictive it was, especially for the Coofit era and for what we see in Operation Lockstep and what we see being rolled out right now
[3:21:39.940 --> 3:21:46.940]  Post-Rate Reset, or at least the initial phases of this, what have we seen in the last few weeks? What did Alex cover all week long?
[3:21:46.940 --> 3:21:56.940]  Shutting off power grids, shutting off water, shutting down farms, factory farms, cows, you can't have your own cattle, you can't have your own food sources, etc, etc
[3:21:56.940 --> 3:22:13.940]  So that's all by design because as Willis Harmon wrote, following the Stanford Research Plans from the 1970s, again following the Royal Society British Imperial Malthusian Plan from decades prior to that, centuries prior to that
[3:22:13.940 --> 3:22:27.940]  The post-industrial society begins with the idea of a universal welfare system based on some kind of token given out, that will be the central bank digital currency, the bank for national settlements
[3:22:27.940 --> 3:22:37.940]  We'll probably have some attempt at an international universal based income, it'll probably roll out through the tech companies through Facebook and things like this
[3:22:37.940 --> 3:22:45.940]  And it says that everybody will be on welfare, because again, remember, what did we see with the placing of the American Indians on welfare and in the black community on welfare?
[3:22:45.940 --> 3:22:57.940]  I'm not saying that there can't be a legitimate place for welfare or something like that, but the point is rather that even though these communities might have been due some aid for what they had gone through
[3:22:57.940 --> 3:23:08.940]  The real reason that the government, the federal government and the Federal Reserve, etc, were putting people on these was not actually to help them, but was rather to control and enslave them
[3:23:08.940 --> 3:23:24.940]  Now that model, and if you remember Alex way long time ago, back in the day, he used to have Russell Means on, and Russell Means would always make this very point that the model that they use for the Native Americans is exactly the model that the New World Order will use for the entire world
[3:23:24.940 --> 3:23:28.940]  He was way ahead of his time on that point, that was perfectly accurate
[3:23:28.940 --> 3:23:33.940]  And again, the point is not that welfare is bad or that people shouldn't get assistance when they need it
[3:23:33.940 --> 3:23:49.940]  The point is that the intention of giving everyone welfare in various communities and then expanding that to the world where a universal basic income is not so that you can lay around in your coompod and have fun all day playing video games and sleeping with dragons
[3:23:49.940 --> 3:23:53.940]  In the metaverse, that's not what the purpose of it is, the purpose is control and enslavement
[3:23:53.940 --> 3:24:00.940]  And he says everybody that buys into this is an extra person, extra people
[3:24:00.940 --> 3:24:11.940]  Have you ever watched the BBC Nature series with David Attenborough and the many lectures and talks that he would give and all these globalist confabs over the last several decades?
[3:24:11.940 --> 3:24:24.940]  Well, the extra people, what do we have to do? Why? There's so many extra people, it makes me sick of my stomach, there's going to be some way in which we're able to crush and destroy all the extra people, look at rid of them
[3:24:24.940 --> 3:24:33.940]  Literally what's on the Georgia Guide Zone, okay, so again, we know this is a real plan, it even says extra people in here, okay, the extra people
[3:24:33.940 --> 3:24:46.940]  He says the key to understanding the future will be a needs-based economy, not an economy where you have sovereignty, where you have private property, where you have wealth, where you have independence
[3:24:46.940 --> 3:24:55.940]  But a completely controlled, tracked, surveilled economy based around needs, well who decides what is the need?
[3:24:55.940 --> 3:25:06.940]  Oh, they do, you see, a centrally controlled technocratic society, needs according to an austerity-based presupposition economy, you see
[3:25:06.940 --> 3:25:18.940]  So the needs are determined on the basis of what the system says in individual needs, and by the way, they eventually say that you don't need to be here, you need to go, you see
[3:25:18.940 --> 3:25:33.940]  It goes on to say that everyone who believes in an individual right in any sense whatsoever, whether you're a libertarian, or whether you're just an independent anarchist, or whether you're a Christian who believes that you're made the image of God
[3:25:33.940 --> 3:25:43.940]  and so you have some individual identity, he says everyone who believes in any kind of individual identity will be submerged in or submissive to the collective identity
[3:25:43.940 --> 3:25:56.940]  Right, now who decides what the collective identity, oh well of course the technocrats, do you see? So this is the transition from rule by politics and so-called democracy, which we all know we don't really have democracy or anything like that
[3:25:56.940 --> 3:26:09.940]  Right, there's the front of elected leaders and so forth, there's the frontispiece of all that, but really we've been, as Dr. Quigley says for a long time, controlled by an oligarchical elite
[3:26:09.940 --> 3:26:24.940]  He goes on to say that in the future you see everything will be given on the basis of what the system determines that you need, and you will only have posterity if the system decides that you are allowed to have posterity, because you're bad for the planet
[3:26:24.940 --> 3:26:43.940]  Now, this is mind boggling because this is everything that is in the National Socialist Program, their agenda, when it came to masterizations, when it came to their philosophy, but now it's all just been rebranded as this sort of tech nerd liberalism and it's all cool, it's all great, right?
[3:26:43.940 --> 3:26:58.940]  And he literally says it will be a collectivist austerity-based system, and he talks about, again, this is 1981, tiny houses, tiny living, you will work from home in the future if you even have work
[3:26:58.940 --> 3:27:21.940]  In 1981, that you would work from home was planned by technocrats in the 70s and 80s, and this is something you've heard Alex talk about a lot, which Willis Harman says, he says that this is going to be more like the middle ages
[3:27:21.940 --> 3:27:34.940]  Now, trad-minded people are like, oh yeah, beige, trad, it's going to be middle ages, no, no, no, it's not middle ages where you have a feudal lord and you're a knight who dies for virtuous noble causes
[3:27:34.940 --> 3:27:46.940]  No, no, this is, Mark Zuckerberg is your feudal lord, and he's sitting over there with giant goblets and big chunks of steak, and you're eating kibble on his plantation, you see
[3:27:46.940 --> 3:27:59.940]  It literally says that the middle ages and the idea of the feudal system is more accurately the type of system that they will bring in where you live on the, it's like the company town
[3:27:59.940 --> 3:28:24.940]  So if you don't know about this in American history, there used to be company towns, and the corporation owned the mine and the town and your apartment, and you basically just rented everything that you needed, your gray underwear, your gray worker suit, your gray boots, your gray hat, everything's gray, right, your gray bread, you just rent that from the company store and you live on the company property
[3:28:24.940 --> 3:28:42.940]  That's the medieval feudal model, and nothing to do with being based in trad and medieval, that's not what we're talking about, we're talking about the worst aspects of medieval feudalism, of monopoly capitalism, of socialism, of democracy, all of the worst aspects of all those is what is going into this future system
[3:28:42.940 --> 3:28:55.940]  And he says that we will not have any religions, it will be a purely, quote, science-based system, technocracy will be science-based, this is the oxygen show, don't go anywhere, I'm your guest host Jay at Dyer of Jay's Analysis

[3:33:10.940 --> 3:33:20.940]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, I want to remind you guys to head on over to the infowarstore, I actually just bought several things in the past couple weeks, especially the nascent iodine, I've been taking that every day

[3:33:31.940 --> 3:33:41.940]  Now we were talking about Willis Harman's millennium essay where he gets into the role of work itself changing in the future because all of society will be revolutionized in the future
[3:33:41.940 --> 3:33:55.940]  This is not revolution in some 1776 sense or some, you know, liberal utopia sense, this is the revolution which they call the final revolution to bring in the total technocratic control
[3:33:55.940 --> 3:34:03.940]  The same people behind this revolution are the same people who helped Hitler, Mao and Stalin come to power
[3:34:03.940 --> 3:34:15.940]  Now not everything that those dictators did went along their plans, but at least insofar as they wanted big wars, cold war, in that regard the elite did get what they wanted
[3:34:15.940 --> 3:34:24.940]  And that's what we find when we go deep into the writings of the elite in the 20th century, particularly in regard to the history of the British Empire, which I read quite a bit about
[3:34:24.940 --> 3:34:38.940]  Now before we get to that though, I want to end what Willis Harman was saying, in the new ethic he says, just the same as what Klaus says, remember Klaus's book, we need to grind the narratives, the great narratives
[3:34:38.940 --> 3:34:52.940]  We need a new story, a new narrative, same thing Willis Harman says in 1981, there will be a new ethic, a new story about what makes man virtuous or what makes man bad, good and bad
[3:34:52.940 --> 3:35:07.940]  The new good and bad will be ecoethics, ecological ethics, that's everything, they hinged everything on that, go back to first global revolution from the club of Rome, it said that we will make humankind the key issue of pollution
[3:35:07.940 --> 3:35:16.940]  Not just toxic pollutants in the sense of chemicals, plastics, etc, that's all true, but also human beings are a pollutant
[3:35:16.940 --> 3:35:31.940]  Humans and carbon in that sense as carbon is the base of life, those are the real pollutants in the world, they have to be depopulated, and the role of work, the role of everything will change based around, hinged around this linchpin of ecoethics
[3:35:31.940 --> 3:35:45.940]  But who says eco, what does that even mean, ecoethics, who decides what's the proper number of human beings on the planet to balance out the so-called sustainability agendas, well of course they do, the technocratically, they say
[3:35:45.940 --> 3:35:57.940]  So again, it's totally arbitrary, right, it's not actually justified, there's not a basis for why we should accept this system, it's a top-down authoritarian control, not based on logic, it's on logic, it's on what?
[3:35:57.940 --> 3:36:10.940]  Evolution, according to them, and a completely socially planned society that has evolved according to them, from the individual to the collective, so you see they just say, oh evolution proves it
[3:36:10.940 --> 3:36:27.940]  Evolution is evolving from you having individual rights to clearly the technocratic collectivist system, and you are no longer an individual, you're a cell in a macro organism, you're a molecule in a larger system
[3:36:27.940 --> 3:36:41.940]  So you have no identity at all, apart from this arbitrary collective, well why should we hinge our identity on the collective, maybe the collective is just made up of individuals, maybe the individual is the starting point, right?
[3:36:41.940 --> 3:36:51.940]  I mean, why should we just assume that collective, the many, is prior to the one, maybe the one is prior to the many, maybe the many is prior to the one, right?
[3:36:51.940 --> 3:37:02.940]  I mean, I have my own views, which I think orthodox Christianity helps solve that classic philosophical problem, but from these people who don't believe in ethics, who don't believe in metaphysics, don't believe in epistemology,
[3:37:02.940 --> 3:37:15.940]  they supposedly just believe in quote, science or scientism, there's no reason or basis to prefer one over the other, there's no such thing as even individuals or collectives, those don't have any real identity, they're just human social constructs.
[3:37:15.940 --> 3:37:27.940]  So you see that this is a totally arbitrary, unjustified, in a philosophical sense system that is based around pure power politics and social engineering.
[3:37:27.940 --> 3:37:31.940]  Now I was mentioning the origins of this philosophy, right?
[3:37:31.940 --> 3:37:41.940]  Now hopefully we know about Malthusianism, and that's of course the so-called minister, Thomas Malthus, who looked at flies flying around in a jar and said,
[3:37:41.940 --> 3:37:47.940]  oh, so the flies in the jar proved to me that there's limited resources.
[3:37:47.940 --> 3:37:54.940]  And so if we don't control the population in England within a generation or two, the whole country will collapse.
[3:37:54.940 --> 3:37:59.940]  So it was a fear-based narrative from Malthus back in his day.
[3:37:59.940 --> 3:38:12.940]  And then we get out of that the connection to the social Darwinian eugenics movement with the Galtons and the Huxleys and so forth, those families all premised their ideology on the same idea of Malthusianism,
[3:38:12.940 --> 3:38:22.940]  intimately tied to social Darwinism, the idea that just whoever is in power has power because they are in terms of biology determined to have that power.
[3:38:22.940 --> 3:38:31.940]  And it doesn't matter how they got it, there is no ethic, there's no right or wrong, there's just power narratives, and there's just control, and there's just basically the worship of death.
[3:38:31.940 --> 3:38:43.940]  That's essentially what the Darwinian paradigm amounts to, the worship of death, and therefore it's justified for the elite in their view to get rid of most people because they're just furthering the evolutionary mechanism itself.
[3:38:43.940 --> 3:38:48.940]  Because death is what propels the system in that worldview.
[3:38:48.940 --> 3:38:55.940]  Where does this weird idea come from? Because we know that it's clearly opposite anything remotely Christian, right?
[3:38:55.940 --> 3:39:05.940]  There's no place at all in whether you're Protestant, classically Protestant, Roman Catholic, Orthodox, there's not really any place at all for this idea of a death cult or a worship of death.
[3:39:05.940 --> 3:39:16.940]  I mean, everybody's theology in the West, at least loosely, biblically based, believes that death is in some way overcome or the enemy or connected to the devil, right?
[3:39:16.940 --> 3:39:29.940]  So why would we have a death cult? Well, death cults are a return to ancient pagan animistic traditions or druidic traditions where the druids actually would worship death and believe in human sacrifice.
[3:39:29.940 --> 3:39:39.940]  If there was a need to placate Mother Earth, she'd crave blood, and if she didn't get blood, then she would wreak havoc in terms of storms and natural disasters.
[3:39:39.940 --> 3:39:46.940]  So it's like an ancient sort of superstitious pagan religion that they revived under the guise of science.
[3:39:46.940 --> 3:40:02.940]  And Alex is 100% right when he says that many of the elite documents, UN documents, Arthur Kessler and others actually said we need to bring back the ancient pagan idea of human sacrifice because they understood the balance of nature and sustainability.
[3:40:02.940 --> 3:40:16.940]  So whether the people at the top of the pyramid are outright Satanists and believe that they're offering blood sacrifices to Lucifer himself, or whether they're just naturalists and believe that this is part of the cyclical biological Earth process,
[3:40:16.940 --> 3:40:27.940]  it doesn't really matter ultimately because it's the same idea, the same game plan that most people have to be gotten rid of because they're the extra people, the extra superstitious people.
[3:40:27.940 --> 3:40:34.940]  That's literally what he says. Harmon, superfluous people. Where does this idea come from?
[3:40:34.940 --> 3:40:53.940]  Well, if you go back to the Reformation, and particularly after Henry VIII and all that debacle, what grew in an English religion was more and more of an interest in not just enlightenment ideas, but in what we could call hermeticism.
[3:40:53.940 --> 3:41:17.940]  And the Elizabethan in particular, if you look at most of the literature, especially the arts, so English lit and so forth, if you go into the history of John Don, Ben Johnson, Edmund Spencer, even Shakespeare, you get this sort of pseudo-Christian stuff in the writings which cloaks hermetic ideas.
[3:41:17.940 --> 3:41:28.940]  And the hermetic principles there are pushed very clearly, especially when you get into these weird esoteric documents like Edmund Spencer's Fairy Queen.
[3:41:28.940 --> 3:41:45.940]  Now, you might think, what does it have to do with what you're talking about? Well, when I was doing my grad work, I got pretty deep into Elizabethan literature because so much of that literature was impregnated with pseudo-Christian ideas that cloaked hermeticism, alchemy, and occult ideas.
[3:41:45.940 --> 3:41:57.940]  And particularly in this case, what happened was, Elizabeth said, I want you, Edmund, to write for me the great mythological story for the British Empire.
[3:41:57.940 --> 3:42:16.940]  So remember, she's the Virgin Queen, supposedly, she has this image where she projected herself as a kind of state-run Virgin Mary, literally. The artwork and the propaganda at that time projected her as the Virgin Queen, as the Virgin Mary, but she's the state queen.
[3:42:16.940 --> 3:42:31.940]  It's a quasi-religious thing. And so she said, I want Virgil's Aeneid for the British Empire. And so she got Spencer, who was not really Christian, more of an esotericist, to write this hermetic alchemical allegory for the British Empire.
[3:42:31.940 --> 3:42:43.940]  Again, as a propaganda piece, what Virgil's Aeneid was for the Roman Empire, this is supposed to be for the British Empire. And it's this weird, massive alchemical hermetic allegory.
[3:42:43.940 --> 3:42:50.940]  It talks about transmigration of souls, which is reincarnation. It's very bizarre. It's not Christian.
[3:42:50.940 --> 3:42:55.940]  We come back, I'm going to tell you the secrets of the very Queen on the Alex Jones show.
[3:42:55.940 --> 3:43:10.940]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass and so many other ingredients that are known to make us healthy, to make us vibrant, and to defend our immune systems.
[3:43:10.940 --> 3:43:21.940]  Now, over a year and a half ago, we came out with a product that was top sourced, top of the line, as good as it's going to get, but then the supply chain broke down and it was sold out for more than a year.
[3:43:21.940 --> 3:43:30.940]  Finally, green fiber capsules, this big old bottle, jam-packed, is back in stock for a limited time at infowarstore.com, 30% off.

[3:43:55.940 --> 3:44:02.940]  Randy Dewright. Randy Dewright, thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[3:44:02.940 --> 3:44:16.940]  Yeah, and first of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[3:44:16.940 --> 3:44:25.940]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually. People think I'm 55 years old.
[3:44:25.940 --> 3:44:33.940]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[3:44:33.940 --> 3:44:42.940]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[3:44:42.940 --> 3:44:48.940]  This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't, I don't have to put it on derma blend anymore, you know.
[3:44:48.940 --> 3:44:54.940]  So anyway, it works wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[3:44:54.940 --> 3:45:05.940]  People ask me all the time, what is your best new tropic? You've got turbo force, you've got brain force plus, and you've got brain force ultra, which one is better?
[3:45:05.940 --> 3:45:14.940]  And that's like asking, what's better, a Ford F-150, or a Cadillac, or a Ferrari.
[3:45:14.940 --> 3:45:21.940]  It's different strokes for different folks. It varies. All three are different formulas. All three do different things.
[3:45:21.940 --> 3:45:28.940]  Turbo force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy. I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[3:45:28.940 --> 3:45:41.940]  Brain force plus is a long term acting, clean, new tropic. This brain force ultra is a super fast acting, new tropic, that creates incredible clarity, but doesn't last very long.
[3:45:41.940 --> 3:45:50.940]  They're all three different formulas. And finally, back in stock, massively discounted, brain force ultra is available at infowarstore.com.
[3:45:50.940 --> 3:45:54.940]  Brain force ultra, back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[3:45:54.940 --> 3:46:03.940]  Donald Trump and the Magna Republicans represented extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.
[3:46:03.940 --> 3:46:11.940]  I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have an operational name. In fact, I bet it does. I bet it's called Operation Matador.
[3:46:11.940 --> 3:46:33.940]  They see us as the bull, and they are shaky, a red flag in our face. And the Matador is the deep state with a long, skinny, razor-sharp sword, so that when the bull lunges forward, the Matador uses the force of its weight to drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape, as the bull buries himself into the dust.
[3:46:33.940 --> 3:46:36.940]  They've got the ace of spades in their hand, which is false flags.
[3:46:36.940 --> 3:46:44.940]  Before you launch a war, you stage false flags. That's the first thing you do, because nobody wants to say they started a war. Bad guys start wars.
[3:46:44.940 --> 3:47:10.940]  So every time a war gets launched by bad guys, they stage an event. This is Operation Matador.
[3:47:10.940 --> 3:47:35.940]  Welcome back to the Alka Junction, your guest host, Jay Dyer of Days and Aalysis. We're getting into the history of the British Empire and its own occult mythology, its own concocted story, its own history about itself to set itself off as a kind of pseudo-Christian, yet hermetic empire that would ultimately establish the great civilization to bring the nations into a progressive future.
[3:47:35.940 --> 3:47:47.940]  That's literally even what was included back at the time of Spencer's Very Quaint, that the idea was that the British Empire would civilize the whole world, because it was the most evolved, the most elite, and so forth.
[3:47:47.940 --> 3:48:05.940]  Now, certainly the British Empire had some positives and it had some negatives. I'm not trying to go too deep into the empire itself, but what happens eventually is that occult esoteric ideology, as it drifted further and further away from its Christian roots in terms of Anglicanism and then whatever it is today,
[3:48:05.940 --> 3:48:22.940]  I don't know what religion we would call the British number, maybe just outright Satanism, I don't know, but the further that it drifted away, the more it adopted principles that gave the appearance of being scientific, but we're not actually scientific, we're actually just another type of cult or religion.
[3:48:22.940 --> 3:48:40.940]  And I would give you, as proof of that, the history of the Royal Society as detailed by the history of Freemasons, which is, there's a great book on this called Freemasonry and the Birth of Modern Science, and this is written by a guy who's part of that Royal Society masonic structure.
[3:48:40.940 --> 3:49:01.940]  And the only reason I cite this book is because it's a history of the Royal Society in terms of their promotion of pragmatism and empiricism and scientism. The idea is that foster evolution, rank materialism and atheism across the world, we can thank the Royal Society for that for the last several centuries.
[3:49:01.940 --> 3:49:13.940]  And there's a method to this madness, though, is what I'm trying to say. There is an occult esoteric philosophy, which is based around the idea very similar to Hinduism, interesting.
[3:49:13.940 --> 3:49:31.940]  You know, ancient Hindu thought, they had this idea of wheels of cyclical rebirths and the aeons of evolution, right, which is what produced man, man is just on this journey in the hierarchical scale of being to where he can evolve to Nirvana, or he can be punished by being reincarnated as something lower.
[3:49:31.940 --> 3:49:47.940]  It's not by accident that the British Empire, when they made India a colony, utilize and appropriate a lot of these occult, an esoteric pagan ideas from Hindu thought, they sort of brought that, especially the caste system, they brought that into a lot of their philosophy.
[3:49:47.940 --> 3:49:58.940]  And that's reflected in this Malthusian idea that the earth can only hold so many people, there's only so many resources. And so the answer to this is to get rid of most people.
[3:49:58.940 --> 3:50:13.940]  Obviously, this is from a demonic source, this notion is demonic, because we know the enemy of mankind is Satan, so the best explanation for why this is such a consistent recurring pattern in history, and especially in the history of empires,
[3:50:13.940 --> 3:50:28.940]  is because it's a thought, an idea, a power behind human beings that pushes this idea, which is demonic. That's the best explanation. And that's why you see empires collapsing eventually.
[3:50:28.940 --> 3:50:44.940]  Now, there's a couple of exceptions, the business empire, it didn't fall into human sacrifice, it actually fell to Islam. But in terms of world pagan empires, they always fall into this trap because they're promoted by and fostered by the devil, I would say.
[3:50:44.940 --> 3:50:51.940]  And that doesn't just have to be empires, you can have the 20th century, we have the century of democide, it can be any kind of leader.
[3:50:51.940 --> 3:51:04.940]  But when you get these leaders who want to kill everyone, because they've gone psychotic and insane, the problem is more than just human, it's something more than that, it's something, not just psychopathy, not just psychology, it's the demonic.
[3:51:04.940 --> 3:51:06.940]  And that's the key point I want to make here.
[3:51:06.940 --> 3:51:21.940]  And so the British Empire eventually did cave over time, more and more to these occult satanic and secular philosophies, which in my view are really the root of all the problems, right.
[3:51:21.940 --> 3:51:25.940]  I'm not saying the British Empire runs everything, right, they cave to the Pax Americana.
[3:51:25.940 --> 3:51:43.940]  But it's not by accident that you have all those British spies who co-opted the United States Empire back into that British imperial model, that's what the Council of Formulations is, that's what the Trilateral Commission is, that's what the steering committees are based on that British imperial model.
[3:51:43.940 --> 3:51:47.940]  And that's what Quigley's whole book is about, especially the Anglo-American establishment.
[3:51:47.940 --> 3:52:06.940]  That's why in the 60s and 70s you had the American establishment at the level of its top thinkers, the Kissinger's, the Brzezinski's, right, these people adopting the Malthusian model of the British Empire, which they had had in place for centuries.
[3:52:06.940 --> 3:52:15.940]  And they have that because they have completely abandoned any semblance of Christianity, Orthodox Christianity at all whatsoever.
[3:52:15.940 --> 3:52:25.940]  In fact, all of that that goes by the name of quote Anglicanism for the most part in England is really just a front for the British power structure, British intelligence and so forth.
[3:52:25.940 --> 3:52:42.940]  And I wanted to point out that there's just this week reading, again, Wall Street and the Bull Street Revolution by Dr. Anthony Sutton, the classic economic text which gets into who really fostered the Soviet Empire, who really got it going.
[3:52:42.940 --> 3:53:05.940]  There's this great page on page 95 where he says that at the time of 1917, right before the Bolsheviks, the British Empire ended up falling to submitting to Lord Milner, part of that Royal Society, Royal Institute for National Affairs, Fabian Circle.
[3:53:05.940 --> 3:53:17.940]  They fell to Fabianism. Lord Milner, through a couple key placed agents and compromised individuals, was able to convince the Lloyd George government to support the Bolsheviks.
[3:53:17.940 --> 3:53:34.940]  And why was this? Because it wasn't just Lord Milner, it was also very wealthy people in America, especially JP Morgan and other front companies and corporations that wanted Russia to fall so that eventually those corporations could come in and buy it up.
[3:53:34.940 --> 3:53:49.940]  You've probably all heard of the John Perkins book, right, Confessions of an Economic Hitman. That model is just an older model repurposed, right, in a corporate way nowadays, but back at this time the corporations and the banks were doing this at the turn of the century.
[3:53:49.940 --> 3:54:10.940]  And so that was the real reason, and there's actually the secret agents of Sir Basil Zaharoff with the knowledge of Lloyd George were able to compromise and get the British Parliament and governmental structure to support the Bolsheviks because these elites were Fabian socialists.
[3:54:10.940 --> 3:54:28.940]  And this goes back to Cecil Rhodes and John Ruskin, who wanted to create a Fabian socialist world government. This is why it's so important to read Bertrand Russell and to read HDULs because they were in the circles of the Fabian socialists.
[3:54:28.940 --> 3:54:39.940]  George Bernard Shaw, all these people. And some of them, Shaw even talks about Satanism openly, right. So there are people in these circles who actually were explicitly satanic, whether they're all Satanists, I don't know about that.
[3:54:39.940 --> 3:54:51.940]  But many of these elites did have secret society connections, especially Cecil Rhodes created his own personal secret society for this end goal of doing what we're talking about here.
[3:54:51.940 --> 3:55:04.940]  And not only that, I just got in the mail a rare book, which I couldn't believe I got a hold of, but this is the memoirs of a British agent, right, a famous British spy, R.H. Bruce Lockhart.
[3:55:04.940 --> 3:55:20.940]  And in his memoirs, he writes about how the Bolshevik Revolution was run by England. I mean, who propagandized Russia with communism, right? Who was behind this?
[3:55:20.940 --> 3:55:32.940]  Well, a lot of people think, oh, you know, Marx, Marx did it and he had the support of Ingalls. Yeah, but who was Ingalls? Ingalls was a wealthy British stock owner.
[3:55:32.940 --> 3:55:48.940]  And so there was an explicit desire on the part of Western elites and power structure to foster revolutions and especially Marxism, socialism and communism in other countries to destroy the existing order.
[3:55:48.940 --> 3:55:55.940]  And then they could come in, buy things up and reorganize everything and then put future generations into debt, quickly says, in those countries.
[3:55:55.940 --> 3:56:04.940]  And by the way, it's not just Bolshevism, the same people, the same money, the same power structure. Guess what? They funded national socialism as well.
[3:56:04.940 --> 3:56:12.940]  So don't get caught up in the geopolitical false left, right? And thinking, oh, you know, they funded the elites. They only fund communists. No, they fund any of these things.
[3:56:12.940 --> 3:56:26.940]  Right. And so remember, what we're going into in this great reset, it does have an occult root in terms of hermeticism, alchemy, especially what we read about in, for example, Edmund Spencer's Fairy Queen.
[3:56:26.940 --> 3:56:35.940]  It does have roots in social Darwinism, elements of Hinduism, elements of British Freemasonry, play a role in all this.
[3:56:35.940 --> 3:56:43.940]  And the desire is to not just construct a world government, every empire ever has had the goal of a world government.
[3:56:43.940 --> 3:56:53.940]  This is a new kind of world government where the human beings are essentially nodes in a giant battery or a giant computer system.
[3:56:53.940 --> 3:57:00.940]  And you'll be locked into a global brain if you're allowed to live after 90% of everybody else has been killed.
[3:57:00.940 --> 3:57:10.940]  That's the real goal. And they all say this. And it's just amazing to go back into British spy, you know, writings and people doing their memoirs and saying,
[3:57:10.940 --> 3:57:16.940]  of course, I learned that our own elites was the one supporting the Bolsheviks. Guess what?
[3:57:16.940 --> 3:57:29.940]  The same thing that McCarthy eventually figures out. Hey, it's not the people in Moscow, it's the American wealthy elites that are promoting communism and Sovietism and fascism and all of these horrible systems.
[3:57:29.940 --> 3:57:34.940]  Right? It's the wealthiest people that push those things by design.
