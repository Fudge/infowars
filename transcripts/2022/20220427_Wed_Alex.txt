[01:23.440 --> 01:28.600]  joining us here today okay I could talk big picture because that's the most
[01:28.600 --> 01:31.880]  important thing I could drill down into all the news that's the symptom of the
[01:31.880 --> 01:34.800]  disease and I'm gonna do both but it's just important to understand what's
[01:34.800 --> 01:42.400]  happening by the 50s there was a scientific consensus in the Anglo-American
[01:42.400 --> 01:45.840]  establishment that means the British Empire merged with the United States
[01:45.840 --> 01:51.680]  ever Bretton Woods to have a post-human world where humans became a corporate
[01:51.680 --> 01:56.800]  commodity of the ruling class that would create stability in war they said and
[01:56.800 --> 01:59.920]  be the final revolution or the end of history it's either called the final
[01:59.920 --> 02:03.720]  revolution or the end of history look those terms up look up anything I say
[02:03.720 --> 02:06.960]  it's how the crickets that they're looking up and find it I tell you
[02:06.960 --> 02:10.760]  Bertrand Russell talked about nuking all the major cities to get rid of most of
[02:10.760 --> 02:15.560]  humans to have peace in the 1950s it's because he said it you can pull it up or
[02:15.560 --> 02:18.120]  I tell you that David Rockefeller bragged the New York Times about putting
[02:18.120 --> 02:26.040]  mouse a tongue into power in 1949 you can look the damn thing up 1976 and so all
[02:26.040 --> 02:30.800]  you got to do is write down when I say and 95% of it is not speculation it is
[02:30.800 --> 02:46.400]  admitted fact a decision was made ladies and gentlemen the decision was made to
[02:46.400 --> 02:51.880]  end free society everywhere and bring in tyranny and that's why you see the
[02:51.880 --> 02:57.320]  headlines in Bloomberg and in the Financial Times of London the Washington
[02:57.320 --> 03:01.960]  Post New York Times saying dictatorship is good censorship is good and that's
[03:01.960 --> 03:07.080]  what we need because they're selling you authoritarianism because they don't want
[03:07.080 --> 03:13.280]  you and I to have a seat at that table I want us to have a seat at the table I
[03:13.280 --> 03:19.960]  want us have a pro-human altruistic renaissance liberal future not the
[03:19.960 --> 03:24.200]  liberal authoritarian counterfeit but the real liberal future that Thomas
[03:24.200 --> 03:30.160]  Jefferson George Washington and Benjamin Franklin and Voltaire and so
[03:30.160 --> 03:34.360]  many other talked about so we've got one hell of a broadcast lined up for you

[08:17.240 --> 08:21.480]  fighting the new world order in media recognized across the board as the
[08:21.480 --> 08:27.960]  genesis point of the resistance all glory goes to God and God working through
[08:27.960 --> 08:33.440]  all of you out there the glory goes to you but it doesn't mean the times aren't
[08:33.440 --> 08:39.720]  about to get really really rough we're under economic warfare and before we in
[08:39.720 --> 08:46.040]  this segment I'm going to air an extremely powerful special report by Greg
[08:46.040 --> 08:51.800]  Reese that's titled incoming carbon taxes in the worldwide climate lockdowns it
[08:51.800 --> 09:00.480]  is beyond central beyond critical beyond essential for you to understand there is
[09:00.480 --> 09:04.800]  a globalist force that wants a post-industrial world six plus billion
[09:04.800 --> 09:08.880]  people starved to death and dead within eight years and even Elon Musk comes out
[09:08.880 --> 09:12.400]  and says we'll have billions die civilization is about to collapse we've
[09:12.400 --> 09:15.720]  got to have a pro-human future we got to have more children we've got to use
[09:15.720 --> 09:22.840]  fossil fuels we've got to set up clean nuclear but the globalists say no you
[09:22.840 --> 09:26.480]  don't get nuclear and you don't get fossil fuels you get windmills which
[09:26.480 --> 09:32.320]  they know can't supply 10% of the energy humans need and never will and all the
[09:32.320 --> 09:35.720]  Hollywood scum and the globalists think we're stupid and think we're gonna sit
[09:35.720 --> 09:39.040]  here while they destroy civilization and then they're gonna claim things are
[09:39.040 --> 09:43.480]  collapsing because of global warming when they're collapsing because of them
[09:43.480 --> 09:49.240]  they are the enemy they are the problem they devalue the currencies they bought
[09:49.240 --> 09:53.000]  up the markets and the infrastructure and the companies and the intellectual
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.800]  property by their fraud and now they're handing us this fraud and this debt and
[09:56.800 --> 10:03.120]  saying oh it's your fault this has happened or oh we didn't know this would
[10:03.120 --> 10:06.240]  take place or Chuck E. Schumer came out there got a video of it here forgot to
[10:06.240 --> 10:11.400]  give it to the crew grab that video and said we need to raise taxes on the
[10:11.400 --> 10:17.400]  middle class and poor people that's the reason we have inflation so right as all
[10:17.400 --> 10:22.000]  your products cost more they want to charge you more taxes so the little
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.720]  people have less money to spend but all the big banks that created the
[10:25.720 --> 10:31.800]  quadrillions in Fiat currency to buy up everything well ladies and gentlemen they
[10:31.800 --> 10:38.080]  say that that's something that we should just submit to and it's something we
[10:38.080 --> 10:41.800]  should just go along with in fact let's play the clip here is clip 10 Chuck E.
[10:41.800 --> 10:47.240]  Schumer claims the only way to reduce Biden inflation is to raise taxes are
[10:47.240 --> 10:51.520]  saying all they to put out a fire is a throw gasoline on it here it is if you
[10:51.520 --> 10:57.080]  want to get rid of inflation the only way to do it is to undo a lot of the
[10:57.080 --> 11:01.040]  Trump tax cuts and raise rates no Republican is ever going to do that so
[11:01.040 --> 11:06.920]  the only way to get rid of inflation is through reconciliation let's go ahead and
[11:06.920 --> 11:11.040]  go to Greg Reese's report on the inflation wars
[11:15.760 --> 11:21.440]  the most effective control technique deployed by the American media is to
[11:21.440 --> 11:26.400]  distract the audience this is very easy to do because everyone takes the bait
[11:26.400 --> 11:32.240]  but today's distractions are threatening our very lives while people are
[11:32.240 --> 11:37.160]  busy discussing their opinions on he said she said nonsense from Hollywood
[11:37.160 --> 11:42.400]  stars and celebrating the fact that one of the billionaires who made hundreds of
[11:42.400 --> 11:47.440]  millions off the COVID lockdowns just bought Twitter the bankers agenda
[11:47.440 --> 11:53.440]  continues to move forward unobstructed the World Economic Forum has made their
[11:53.440 --> 11:58.400]  intentions clear you will own nothing and like it and the best way to
[11:58.400 --> 12:03.320]  accomplish this is through more lockdowns permanent lockdowns with
[12:03.320 --> 12:09.520]  occasional breaks for good behavior just as China led the way in 2020 showing
[12:09.520 --> 12:14.640]  the world how efficiently a totalitarian regime can fight a fake pandemic the
[12:14.640 --> 12:19.880]  rest of the world soon followed Shanghai is now building cages around entire
[12:19.880 --> 12:24.200]  apartment buildings to keep people from escaping an entire new method of
[12:24.200 --> 12:29.720]  government mass murder America's version will be so much more cozy world
[12:29.720 --> 12:34.400]  nations are beginning to adopt the carbon tax and cutting off the fuel
[12:34.400 --> 12:40.440]  supply while announcing massive fuel shortages in America Gavin Newsom is
[12:40.440 --> 12:45.360]  leading the way by cutting off the water and power to Californians after years of
[12:45.360 --> 12:50.040]  creating the problem by turning off production while facing a massive
[12:50.040 --> 12:55.280]  fertilizer shortage Bill Gates owns the majority of farmland and wants you to
[12:55.280 --> 13:00.280]  eat nothing but genetically modified synthetic food products and he marches
[13:00.280 --> 13:05.200]  forward no matter how much you make fun of them on social media and while we
[13:05.200 --> 13:09.840]  face an immediate shortage of fresh foods and staple items over a dozen food
[13:09.840 --> 13:15.720]  processing plants have been destroyed in recent weeks it may not be possible to
[13:15.720 --> 13:20.040]  see the entire picture from the level where we are at but they are going to
[13:20.040 --> 13:24.440]  shut us down again the very systems of government we believed were put in place
[13:24.440 --> 13:29.400]  to serve us are being used to kill us by billionaires and banks while they
[13:29.400 --> 13:35.240]  maximize their own profits that much is clear and as far as the ones perpetrating
[13:35.240 --> 13:40.440]  this human liquidation what they can clearly see is that we will obey we will
[13:40.440 --> 13:44.640]  put the mask on when we are told and we will take it off when we are told and
[13:44.640 --> 13:49.200]  we will celebrate that as a victory they know that we will ignore their
[13:49.200 --> 13:53.640]  destruction of America so long as they feed us distractions to ruminate over on
[13:53.640 --> 13:59.920]  social media just as they are doing right now on January 20th of this year the
[13:59.920 --> 14:05.320]  WHO submitted a proposal that would give the world health organization international
[14:05.320 --> 14:10.640]  authority over pandemic response meaning no more recommendations but
[14:10.640 --> 14:15.760]  de facto law this proposal has been fast-tracked by Washington for
[14:15.760 --> 14:20.200]  consideration at the World Health Assembly this May they want to make you
[14:20.200 --> 14:26.920]  stay inside your home and die quietly peacefully where no one notices many of
[14:26.920 --> 14:31.000]  you may doubt that they will get away with any of this but our actions say
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.800]  differently our actions suggest that they can do it again and so long as we
[14:35.800 --> 14:39.640]  have a voice on Twitter once we are locked down in our homes again we can
[14:39.640 --> 14:46.200]  complain of the food shortages the rolling blackouts and the cyberattacks
[14:47.200 --> 14:56.000]  reporting for info wars this is Greg Reese if you want to survive you want to
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.080]  stop what they're doing you've got to take action you've got to go to banned
[15:00.080 --> 15:03.680]  out video it's a featured video or click the left hand corner for the Gregory
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.840]  section it just went up a few minutes ago and the headline is very very
[15:08.840 --> 15:13.600]  important to understand what we're dealing with incoming carbon taxes and
[15:13.600 --> 15:19.000]  worldwide climate lockdowns that's their plan they said it ten years ago and two
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.320]  years ago we knew it was coming and here it is being announced in Italy and other
[15:23.320 --> 15:27.520]  areas so for my own sake and my family's sake I won't get out of this unless you
[15:27.520 --> 15:31.520]  wake up I'm talking to new listeners and none of us will get out of this unless we
[15:31.520 --> 15:35.120]  wake up the sheeple so listeners the games are over the world governments out
[15:35.120 --> 15:39.120]  in the open the wars the open borders the forced inoculations of the climate
[15:39.120 --> 15:42.480]  lockdowns it's all here I've got articles right here mainstream news by
[15:42.480 --> 15:47.600]  denouncing the UN will control all of our COVID responses or disease responses
[15:47.600 --> 15:52.840]  in the future it's all happening now sure I put it in my film in game 15 years
[15:52.840 --> 15:57.360]  ago what does that matter if we don't take action
[15:59.240 --> 16:03.760]  it's about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand in for worse I've been on the
[16:03.760 --> 16:07.960]  air a couple years but I only had money to finance my own simple little local
[16:07.960 --> 16:11.400]  radio show I wanted to hire camera people I wanted to make films I wanted to
[16:11.400 --> 16:15.320]  really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt I designed the first one
[16:15.320 --> 16:20.720]  mass murderers agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first
[16:20.720 --> 16:24.680]  three members of my crew that's our oldest design and we still sell it we
[16:24.680 --> 16:28.440]  have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions
[16:28.440 --> 16:32.720]  because whatever stuff we've got in that's it we're selling everything out
[16:32.720 --> 16:36.760]  to find the operation to get rid of inventory we'll still have some teachers
[16:36.760 --> 16:40.280]  in the future they'll just be limited editions and short runs so if you want

[17:16.200 --> 17:19.520]  because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of
[17:19.520 --> 17:23.360]  millions of dollars and now with band-aid video getting close to 10 million

[21:07.560 --> 21:13.600]  around the world since after World War two and the globalists know that they're
[21:13.600 --> 21:17.440]  waging war on the American people while they wage war on everybody else in the
[21:17.440 --> 21:21.200]  next segment I'm gonna hit the huge Russian news that just gets more and more
[21:21.200 --> 21:25.880]  dire more and more serious and then the censorship news and the inflation news
[21:25.880 --> 21:29.400]  and the economy and then a special guest Count Dankula great comedian and
[21:29.400 --> 21:32.440]  youtuber good friend of mine is going to be coming on to talk about the Elon
[21:32.440 --> 21:36.960]  Musk censorship and the audio that Veritas got of the executives trying to
[21:36.960 --> 21:41.080]  talk about how they're gonna try to stop Elon Musk that's all next hour but I
[21:41.080 --> 21:48.600]  wanted to spend a few minutes right now talking about an investment you know we
[21:48.600 --> 21:51.240]  think about our children if you have children we think about how they want
[21:51.240 --> 21:54.240]  them to have children and we want to have a successful civilization for them
[21:54.240 --> 21:58.400]  we're pro-human the globalist humans has failed and bad and ugly and they want to
[21:58.400 --> 22:04.520]  have a post human world that's their transhumanist operation but info wars is
[22:04.520 --> 22:09.400]  like a line of people in the 28 years it's been on air the thousands of
[22:09.400 --> 22:12.040]  thousands of guests the tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of calls
[22:12.040 --> 22:18.240]  the tens of thousands of huge stories and hundreds of top stories broken that
[22:18.240 --> 22:23.520]  really changed the course of history it's about that fight going on into the
[22:23.520 --> 22:30.200]  future and you know who you are out there and our great time of need with the
[22:30.200 --> 22:34.520]  corrupt system surrounding us doing everything he had to shut us down you
[22:34.520 --> 22:40.680]  came through last week and dug us 40 plus percent out of the hole and then I
[22:40.680 --> 22:46.120]  just learned today that two days ago we got a big donation that was now gone
[22:46.120 --> 22:51.160]  through and confirmed that got us 60 plus percent of the hole right now praise
[22:51.160 --> 22:55.480]  God and I want to thank the individual that donated and they know who they are
[22:55.480 --> 22:59.880]  we don't know who they are but it was substantive and it's gonna be when
[22:59.880 --> 23:05.320]  people that have means get off the bench that this fight will get one very very
[23:05.320 --> 23:10.960]  quickly but it's been the little people the dishwashers and the truck drivers
[23:10.960 --> 23:15.560]  and the farmers and the police officers and the school teachers that had been
[23:15.560 --> 23:19.280]  buying the t-shirts and buying the books and buying the films and you know get
[23:19.280 --> 23:22.040]  the supplements and they get a great response back our coffee is really high
[23:22.040 --> 23:25.160]  quality and it's at a low price but but the point is they've been the ones
[23:25.160 --> 23:29.720]  carrying the bulk of the weight you know I've met with well-known billionaires
[23:29.720 --> 23:33.240]  and others that say they're supporters and I don't even get around to ask it
[23:33.240 --> 23:38.720]  for money because the average billionaire could turn a piece of coal in
[23:38.720 --> 23:42.800]  their rear end into a diamond and that's fine but my issue is with the
[23:42.800 --> 23:47.440]  devaluation and the tyranny and the war the middle class the nouveau reach the
[23:47.440 --> 23:53.560]  ultra-wealthy you're gonna lose everything if you don't put skin in the
[23:53.560 --> 24:00.320]  game and that's why I'm asking everybody to remember how important info wars is
[24:00.320 --> 24:05.160]  and don't take any day we're on air for granted I know I don't a very humbling
[24:05.160 --> 24:09.880]  ask you on my knees metaphysically to pray for us and to pray for yourself and
[24:09.880 --> 24:13.240]  to pray for awakening and pray for peace and pray for justice and pray for
[24:13.240 --> 24:17.400]  stability and pray for innovation and pray for the satanic system in our
[24:17.400 --> 24:21.800]  way to get behind us so we can move on with God's plan if we choose that
[24:21.800 --> 24:26.000]  through free will so on a commend everybody that donated last week you

[27:04.040 --> 27:09.960]  us on air and I'll just leave it at this the extra profit in this why it has the
[27:09.960 --> 27:14.600]  markup is to pay them back because they're patriots they stepped up and
[27:14.600 --> 27:17.900]  they took care of us I'm gonna leave it at that and for the first time in my

[27:21.360 --> 27:26.760]  to pay them back and so that's what this is about that's why you see the lies

[33:29.800 --> 33:35.520]  the countries that Russia has attacked over the last years Georgia leaving
[33:35.520 --> 33:38.800]  forces in Transnistria and Moldova and then repeatedly Ukraine these are
[33:38.800 --> 33:43.240]  countries that were not part of NATO it has not attacked NATO countries for
[33:43.240 --> 33:46.160]  probably a very good reason you could also argue the countries they've attacked
[33:46.160 --> 33:51.760]  were part of Russia well that we're part of the Soviet yes I firmly disagree
[33:51.760 --> 33:56.120]  with with with that proposition it is the fundamental right of these countries
[33:56.120 --> 33:59.680]  to decide their own future and their own destiny and not saying there's not but
[33:59.680 --> 34:04.160]  I'm saying that the countries that have been attacked Georgia and Ukraine were
[34:04.160 --> 34:08.520]  part of the Soviet Union and they were part of the Soviet Union since the
[34:08.520 --> 34:12.920]  1920s but that does not that does not give Russia the right to attack them on
[34:12.920 --> 34:16.880]  the country no one's saying it does but it really was nothing to them being part
[34:16.880 --> 34:21.320]  of this empire by force now senator Paul went on to echo several Russian
[34:21.320 --> 34:25.720]  talking points and criticize the United States for agitating for Ukraine to join
[34:25.720 --> 34:31.480]  NATO last fall something Russia considers a red line there could have been
[34:31.480 --> 34:35.760]  voices before this invasion instead of agitating for something that we knew our
[34:35.760 --> 34:40.840]  adversary absolutely hated and said was a red line as recently as last
[34:40.840 --> 34:45.960]  September before you sign the agreement once again agitating for NATO Russia
[34:45.960 --> 34:49.720]  said that it was a red line now there is no justification for the invasion I'm
[34:49.720 --> 34:53.960]  not saying that but there are reasons for the invasion and I think it's added
[34:53.960 --> 34:59.240]  nothing joining us now former US ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and
[34:59.240 --> 35:04.720]  sienna national security correspondent Kylie Atwood during that first thing that
[35:04.720 --> 35:09.160]  senator Paul said you were making exasperated sounds is how I'll put it
[35:09.160 --> 35:15.160]  you were I mean what do you think when you hear him say that so Brianna those
[35:15.160 --> 35:20.000]  countries Georgia that the Russians invaded in 2008 and Ukraine the Russians
[35:20.000 --> 35:25.280]  invaded in 2014 as well as today they're sovereign nations they've been
[35:25.280 --> 35:32.080]  sovereign nations since independence in 1991 30 years they've been independent
[35:32.080 --> 35:37.720]  sovereign nations get to decide what their security arrangements are and so
[35:37.720 --> 35:44.760]  for for anyone to say that because they were part of an empire before they can
[35:44.760 --> 35:48.880]  be attacked it doesn't make any sense and that's the exact point that the
[35:48.880 --> 35:54.320]  Secretary of State very clearly made right he shut down Rand Paul's line of
[35:54.320 --> 36:00.760]  questioning which was based on this idea that because these countries had at one
[36:00.760 --> 36:06.560]  point been part of the Soviet Union that may have frustrated Putin even more
[36:06.560 --> 36:11.600]  when he heard about Ukraine's desires that have existed for a long time to
[36:11.600 --> 36:16.880]  join NATO and that could have prompted them to invade Russia and to invade
[36:16.880 --> 36:20.840]  Ukraine you heard the Secretary of State saying listen any country's history
[36:20.840 --> 36:26.560]  doesn't justify Russia invading them the sovereign nation has the right to choose
[36:26.560 --> 36:33.960]  their own alliance and that's seeing in that no one believes so even what's
[36:33.960 --> 36:38.360]  seeing in saying it's true and it's not the average American sees that and says
[36:38.360 --> 36:41.480]  well it must be the opposite Putin must be good when it's more complex than
[36:41.480 --> 36:44.800]  that that's what the establishment's finally figuring out everyone hates them
[36:44.800 --> 36:48.440]  they can say the sky is blue and water is wet and fish swim in the ocean and
[36:48.440 --> 36:53.480]  birds fly around in the sky and no one would believe it because they are a pack
[36:53.480 --> 36:58.280]  of criminal anti-American scum that have been waging economic and cultural and
[36:58.280 --> 37:04.440]  chemical war through fentanyl and other drugs against us our problem our enemy
[37:04.440 --> 37:09.800]  in front of us it's not Vladimir Putin it's the globalist New World Order
[37:09.800 --> 37:17.320]  Chai Khan alliance that's destroying us but I have here the video and the
[37:17.320 --> 37:21.520]  articles and I'll show it to you of the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin
[37:21.520 --> 37:28.800]  yesterday saying yeah we may have Ukraine join NATO when an agreement was
[37:28.800 --> 37:35.040]  signed in the 90s with the Russians not to turn those countries into public
[37:35.040 --> 37:40.160]  states of NATO or the European Union and now we've had US troops there for 10
[37:40.160 --> 37:45.760]  years eight years ago they overthrew the elected government that was somewhat
[37:45.760 --> 37:55.480]  pro-Russia and then started attacking the border regions of Russia in Ukraine
[37:55.480 --> 38:02.560]  absolutely insane absolutely dangerous and so it's the globalist started this
[38:02.560 --> 38:09.320]  did Putin walk into a trap yeah I mean it's it's hit the news years after I
[38:09.320 --> 38:12.400]  told you because I know the soldiers but I can also we'll look at the
[38:12.400 --> 38:16.920]  congressional funding but I mean they've got so many US soldiers over there
[38:16.920 --> 38:21.240]  that there are multiple people in this building that have been over there fighting
[38:21.240 --> 38:25.000]  the Russians in the last few years fighting the Russians in this building
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.520]  and there have everybody I know that's long-term army has been over there at
[38:30.520 --> 38:34.320]  one point or another or knows all about it I can't swing a stick in the dark
[38:34.320 --> 38:37.760]  around military people and I'd hit somebody with it that's been over there
[38:37.760 --> 38:43.240]  training people how to kill Russians or how to attack those Russian held areas
[38:43.240 --> 38:47.960]  on the Russian border so the Russians knew what they were getting into and
[38:47.960 --> 38:51.320]  they've said they're fully committed and they expected to fight NATO and
[38:51.320 --> 38:55.400]  Labroth came out yesterday and said we are fighting NATO and we're not gonna
[38:55.400 --> 38:58.960]  stop and the Russians have said we don't care if five million Russians die we're
[38:58.960 --> 39:02.400]  not gonna stop and you know 20 something million Russians died kicking
[39:02.400 --> 39:06.440]  Hitler's ass and I'm not saying my grandfather's the Army Air Corps weren't
[39:06.440 --> 39:10.120]  part of taking down Hitler but we lost less than a million people they lost 20
[39:10.120 --> 39:13.960]  plus million they're not gonna give up this is not Afghanistan ladies and
[39:13.960 --> 39:16.960]  gentlemen they're not gonna stop doesn't matter how high-tech the West weapons
[39:16.960 --> 39:23.200]  are it's it's not gonna stop and that's where this is going we are now in a
[39:23.200 --> 39:29.960]  direct war no longer a proxy war with the Russians and if the Russians were
[39:29.960 --> 39:33.440]  promoting communism and doing all this stuff and over here I would actually
[39:33.440 --> 39:39.400]  say well okay maybe we should do that I'm not a pacifist but the new world order
[39:39.400 --> 39:47.720]  is attacking us and attacking Russia and I've had enough of it so almost
[39:47.720 --> 39:55.520]  everyone I know this career army has been or is over there with those platoons
[39:55.520 --> 40:01.120]  firing missiles and directing weapons with US satellites at the Russians we
[40:01.120 --> 40:05.600]  are at war with Russia a major mobilization you know why we quote pulled
[40:05.600 --> 40:09.360]  out so haphazardly out of Afghanistan because they knew Russia had decided to
[40:09.360 --> 40:13.120]  go in last year I told you Russia would go in by February they went in by
[40:13.120 --> 40:20.360]  February I'm not pulling this stuff out of a hat or out of my arse and I'm not
[40:20.360 --> 40:25.760]  gonna pull out of my rear end excuse my French what is about to happen right now
[40:25.760 --> 40:32.440]  if the brakes don't get put to this here's the headlines Russia cuts natural
[40:32.440 --> 40:37.040]  gas to two NATO countries in escalation they've cut off natural gas to members
[40:37.040 --> 40:41.360]  Poland and Bulgaria today and threatened to do the same to other
[40:41.360 --> 40:46.160]  countries dramatically escalating its standoff with the West over the war in
[40:46.160 --> 40:51.520]  Ukraine European leaders decried to move as blackmail
[40:51.520 --> 40:56.480]  Putin warns of quick response if West intervenes in Ukraine which they're
[40:56.480 --> 41:01.720]  already doing striking Western targets that's called World War three Defense
[41:01.720 --> 41:06.600]  Secretary Austin Ukraine may still join NATO despite warnings by Russia see the
[41:06.600 --> 41:19.040]  article info wars calm see him say it on video and it goes on from there my
[41:19.040 --> 41:24.080]  friends you already saw the clip Rand Paul argues US should not have back to
[41:24.080 --> 41:27.920]  Ukraine's NATO aspirations citing Russia's stated reasoning behind the
[41:27.920 --> 41:33.200]  invasion which is a fact and they go oh what are you pro Russia no Russia said it
[41:33.200 --> 41:38.280]  would invade if the West did that that's all he stated was reality but if you
[41:38.280 --> 41:43.800]  tell people reality you're bad according to the Washington Post Trump's right he
[41:43.800 --> 41:46.480]  said we have stupid people not running our country the world is going to be
[41:46.480 --> 41:51.440]  blown to pieces let me have this video it's on info wars calm not going to play
[41:51.440 --> 41:54.840]  it because the time constraints when America tried to keep Ukraine in the
[41:54.840 --> 42:02.320]  USSR 1991 the agreement they say doesn't exist it is an agreement it does
[42:02.320 --> 42:06.520]  exist we have the damn video of the US president and the Secretary of Defense
[42:06.520 --> 42:09.720]  Colin Powell saying there's an agreement and when the president says
[42:09.720 --> 42:12.840]  there's an agreement that's the same as the treaty there is an agreement in
[42:12.840 --> 42:19.160]  perpetuity broken promises and then it gets crazier it's not discrimination
[42:19.160 --> 42:24.440]  Wimbledon officials gaslight public over decision to discriminate against Russian
[42:24.440 --> 42:32.240]  players banning all Russian players from the sport there's also another video on
[42:32.240 --> 42:36.280]  info wars calm as Italians are furious as Ukrainian Nazi sympathizers
[42:36.280 --> 42:41.480]  incorporated into liberation day parade the celebration Italy has for six months
[42:41.480 --> 42:45.360]  for the end of the war when the Nazis were kicked out of Italy and now known
[42:45.360 --> 42:52.160]  Nazis are in the anti-Hitler parades in Italy unbelievable info wars calm tomorrow
[42:52.160 --> 42:55.240]  Zeus today we're going to come back and hit what's happened with the economy and
[42:55.240 --> 42:57.840]  more stay with us
[42:58.960 --> 43:03.480]  it's about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand info wars I've been on the air a
[43:03.480 --> 43:07.800]  couple of years but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio
[43:07.800 --> 43:11.520]  show I wanted to hire camera people I wanted to make films I wanted to really
[43:11.520 --> 43:15.560]  challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt I designed the first one mass
[43:15.560 --> 43:20.320]  murderers agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first
[43:20.320 --> 43:24.360]  two members of my crew that's our oldest design and he's still selling we have
[43:24.360 --> 43:28.640]  that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions because
[43:28.640 --> 43:33.240]  whatever stuff we've got in that's it we're selling everything out to find the
[43:33.240 --> 43:36.840]  operation to get rid of inventory we'll still have some teachers in the future
[43:36.840 --> 43:40.440]  they'll just be limited editions and short runs so if you want to get any of
[43:40.440 --> 43:44.560]  these historic shirts this is your last chance when almost forgot we're selling
[43:44.560 --> 43:50.600]  them all at cost at infowarstore.com every ball cap every flag every hoodie
[43:50.600 --> 43:54.640]  every long sleeve every t-shirt regular shirts designer shirts they're all
[43:54.640 --> 44:00.560]  selling at cost infowarstore.com the average person on the face of this
[44:00.560 --> 44:04.760]  incredible planet is still unaware there's a war between free individuals
[44:04.760 --> 44:09.480]  and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other who are
[44:09.480 --> 44:14.080]  literally trying to create a post-human world. From the United States to Brazil
[44:14.080 --> 44:18.020]  and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK nations were pulling out of the
[44:18.020 --> 44:21.880]  private corporate fascist world government that's why they launched their
[44:21.880 --> 44:27.920]  great reset and their program after collapsing us of build back better this
[44:27.920 --> 44:33.080]  is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy
[44:33.080 --> 44:36.960]  because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the
[44:36.960 --> 44:41.800]  left which is the ideology of this world government system couldn't win they
[44:41.800 --> 44:47.240]  released a biological weapon on us now we know two years ago we learned about
[44:47.240 --> 44:51.440]  about 20 months ago it's that simple they can't be because of our free speech
[44:51.440 --> 44:55.800]  and our guns so the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know
[44:55.800 --> 45:02.000]  the rest of history expose this paradigm and we win if I had to describe with
[45:02.000 --> 45:10.560]  just one word the brainwashing the mind control the asleep France but the
[45:10.560 --> 45:17.080]  general public is in the best word would actually be the people are lost just
[45:17.080 --> 45:21.720]  like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare you're in a car and get
[45:21.720 --> 45:28.840]  knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy
[45:28.840 --> 45:32.560]  and confused you have a concussion and that's what the globalists have done
[45:32.560 --> 45:37.000]  they have stunned us they have put us into a position of not knowing our
[45:37.000 --> 45:40.480]  bearings and then Klaus Schwab recently came out in game speech he called the
[45:40.480 --> 45:44.840]  great new narrative where he brags how the public is lost how the culture in
[45:44.840 --> 45:49.280]  the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone so they can
[45:49.280 --> 45:52.920]  now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff that's what the great reset is
[45:52.920 --> 45:59.360]  they need darkness to thrive light lives at info wars dot com you know it's a
[45:59.360 --> 46:03.960]  fact and I'm not bragging when I say it it's just true that info wars is seen
[46:03.960 --> 46:10.840]  by the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human
[46:10.840 --> 46:15.560]  populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program and
[46:15.560 --> 46:22.680]  man our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've
[46:22.680 --> 46:28.120]  ever done so I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products thousands
[46:28.120 --> 46:32.440]  of them at info wars toward calm and we are funded by listeners and viewers like
[46:32.440 --> 46:36.840]  you and so now we need to support more than ever because this fight has
[46:36.840 --> 46:41.600]  intensified don't need me to tell you that at info wars toward calm we've got
[46:41.600 --> 46:46.520]  25 to 75% off across the board right now things have been sold out for a long
[46:46.520 --> 46:51.240]  time like info wars life fizzy magnesium mix that's so amazing and our new
[46:51.240 --> 46:57.120]  immune support formula that's so critical they're all available 25 to 75% off
[46:57.120 --> 47:04.440]  and in four store calm right now leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new
[47:04.440 --> 47:30.440]  world order it's alex jones
[48:04.980 --> 48:17.200]  practice
[48:28.280 --> 48:32.920]  a lot of big stuff going on that I can't tell you that it's all in
[48:32.920 --> 48:35.920]  It's all in confidence.
[48:35.920 --> 48:38.920]  I want to say hi to all the folks they're tuning in right now.
[48:38.920 --> 48:42.920]  A good friend I was just talking to during text.
[48:42.920 --> 48:44.920]  All right.
[48:44.920 --> 48:49.920]  You know, there's a big awakening happening, but we are very dependent on just on time delivery
[48:49.920 --> 48:52.920]  and this very complex civilization we live in and the supply chain.
[48:52.920 --> 48:54.920]  You don't need me to tell you that.
[48:54.920 --> 48:58.920]  But if you look at what the big corporations are doing in lockstep,
[48:58.920 --> 49:04.920]  they are sabotaging and shutting that down across the board.
[49:04.920 --> 49:06.920]  And then playing dumb and going,
[49:06.920 --> 49:10.920]  we didn't know if we printed quadrillions and money and debitar themselves,
[49:10.920 --> 49:12.920]  but that would hurt you.
[49:12.920 --> 49:16.920]  And again, Chuck E. Schumer's answer is raise taxes on middle class working people.
[49:16.920 --> 49:18.920]  The very thing you don't do during inflation.
[49:18.920 --> 49:23.920]  I mean, whatever the default is of you don't want to do it,
[49:23.920 --> 49:25.920]  like you don't want to take 100 hits of acid, that'll kill you.
[49:25.920 --> 49:27.920]  Well, let's just do that.
[49:27.920 --> 49:29.920]  Or you don't want to pour gasoline all over yourself and light yourself on fire.
[49:29.920 --> 49:31.920]  Well, let's just do that.
[49:31.920 --> 49:33.920]  And they're doing it.
[49:33.920 --> 49:37.920]  So US inflation climbed to 8.5 in March,
[49:37.920 --> 49:42.920]  highest rate ever because they're manipulating the rate.
[49:42.920 --> 49:48.920]  Chuck Schumer, only way to reduce inflation is to raise taxes.
[49:48.920 --> 49:50.920]  Homebuying is becoming unaffordable for most Americans.
[49:50.920 --> 49:56.920]  Here's what experts predict for the housing market.
[49:56.920 --> 50:03.920]  Don't worry, climate zealot Mark Rufio doesn't believe in utilizing nuclear energy.
[50:03.920 --> 50:06.920]  Nuclear is expensive and very dangerous.
[50:06.920 --> 50:08.920]  Yeah, if it's not run right,
[50:08.920 --> 50:12.920]  but you can't cut off all the fossil fuels when nothing else works
[50:12.920 --> 50:16.920]  while you guys also destroy the hydroelectric dams.
[50:16.920 --> 50:18.920]  But he's an actor, given his talking point,
[50:18.920 --> 50:22.920]  to go out and be the hero because he wants to cut off the carbon
[50:22.920 --> 50:27.920]  that creates carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[50:27.920 --> 50:34.920]  And then that leads us to this next stack of news on the economy.
[50:34.920 --> 50:47.920]  China's quote campaign to wipe out COVID is crushing its economy.
[50:47.920 --> 50:49.920]  But whose economy is it really crushing?
[50:49.920 --> 50:51.920]  It's a communist economy.
[50:51.920 --> 50:53.920]  It's an economic warfare against the West right now.
[50:53.920 --> 50:56.920]  That's what's really going on.
[50:56.920 --> 51:00.920]  And let's shift into the fact that they have almost no COVID deaths,
[51:00.920 --> 51:03.920]  but COVID cases off a fraudulent PCR test.
[51:03.920 --> 51:04.920]  They're admitted to be fraud.
[51:04.920 --> 51:06.920]  Hell, two plus years ago, we told they were fraud.
[51:06.920 --> 51:08.920]  The government admits they're a fraud for a year.
[51:08.920 --> 51:11.920]  Off of those, they continue the lockdowns.
[51:11.920 --> 51:14.920]  And so does Israel.
[51:14.920 --> 51:19.920]  Israel, why is all cause mortality increasing?
[51:19.920 --> 51:25.920]  Well, what is the European and German and UK and US and Canadian insurance companies
[51:25.920 --> 51:41.920]  finalized six months, a 40 plus percent increase in death in 18 to 64.
[51:41.920 --> 51:43.920]  So this is not debated.
[51:43.920 --> 51:45.920]  This is mainstream news I'm reading.
[51:45.920 --> 51:48.920]  Why is everybody dying of blood clots and heart attacks and cancer?
[51:48.920 --> 51:50.920]  Well, because that's what this does.
[51:50.920 --> 51:51.920]  It's not a vaccine.
[51:51.920 --> 51:58.920]  It's a prion generating system that colonizes and takes over your body.
[51:58.920 --> 52:03.920]  And then it collapses your economy after they've done that.
[52:03.920 --> 52:06.920]  But then they've got headlines like this out of Forbes.
[52:06.920 --> 52:08.920]  You know, Forbes was owned by the Communist Chinese Party.
[52:08.920 --> 52:10.920]  You know, I knew that years ago.
[52:10.920 --> 52:11.920]  I forgot about it.
[52:11.920 --> 52:14.920]  I was at dinner with some very successful business people
[52:14.920 --> 52:16.920]  that are involved in media the other night.
[52:16.920 --> 52:19.920]  And they pointed that out and said, Alex, we never hear you talk about this.
[52:19.920 --> 52:25.920]  I said, oh, I forgot that it's 100% owned by subsidiaries of the Communist Party.
[52:25.920 --> 52:27.920]  And what are they telling you?
[52:27.920 --> 52:33.920]  Unvaccinated people increase risk of COVID infection among vaccinated studies.
[52:33.920 --> 52:34.920]  Fine.
[52:34.920 --> 52:41.920]  Oh, oh, if you take the shot, it doesn't protect you from the virus.
[52:41.920 --> 52:46.920]  But I thought that's the whole point of a vaccine.
[52:46.920 --> 52:47.920]  All lies.
[52:47.920 --> 52:52.920]  Mix with the unvaccinated increases COVID-19 risk for the unvaccinated studies.
[52:52.920 --> 52:54.920]  So it doesn't protect you from the virus.
[52:54.920 --> 52:59.920]  And I told you this was coming for a long, long time.
[52:59.920 --> 53:00.920]  It's all over the news.
[53:00.920 --> 53:06.920]  Chile passes a law prohibiting discrimination against mutants and genetically altered people.
[53:06.920 --> 53:11.920]  So corporations can make genetically altered people that aren't even human that they control
[53:11.920 --> 53:14.920]  that are owned by the corporation, but then they have rights.
[53:14.920 --> 53:18.920]  And that's where the transhumanist movement of seeing a man as a woman, a woman as a man,
[53:18.920 --> 53:21.920]  a biological man can get women pregnant and rape them in the prison.
[53:21.920 --> 53:22.920]  But it's OK.
[53:22.920 --> 53:24.920]  It's getting you ready for this.
[53:24.920 --> 53:29.920]  A law in Chile prohibits discrimination against mutants and genetically altered people.
[53:29.920 --> 53:36.920]  The Curious Regulation was presented by Senator Alejandro Navarro-Brain, approved universally,
[53:36.920 --> 53:41.920]  unanimously, and published in the official Gazette Wednesday.
[53:41.920 --> 53:43.920]  You might want to go read that article.
[53:43.920 --> 53:47.920]  It's a big, big, big, big deal.
[53:47.920 --> 53:50.920]  Talk about next decade's news today.
[53:50.920 --> 53:52.920]  You got it.
[53:52.920 --> 53:54.920]  But here is Obama.
[53:54.920 --> 53:56.920]  That's really his president, his third term.
[53:56.920 --> 53:59.920]  Here's Obama's, Biden's a puppet.
[53:59.920 --> 54:08.920]  Here's Obama's current COVID advisor, Ashija, says America will give its sovereignty as a nation
[54:08.920 --> 54:13.920]  and let the World Health Organization override its constitution during pandemics.
[54:13.920 --> 54:22.920]  That's officially a global treaty going through right now that we're going to hit here in just a few minutes.
[54:22.920 --> 54:26.920]  And here's some of the other headlines are COVID vaccines causing liver failure.
[54:26.920 --> 54:27.920]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[54:27.920 --> 54:28.920]  We predicted it would.
[54:28.920 --> 54:33.920]  Here's the studies on it turning your immune system off or causing horrible autoimmune disorders.
[54:33.920 --> 54:41.920]  Immune, innate immune suppression, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, the role of G-quadriplexes
[54:41.920 --> 54:44.920]  in exosomes and microRNAs.
[54:44.920 --> 54:48.920]  You might want to go read that for yourself.
[54:48.920 --> 54:50.920]  But oh, it's OK.
[54:50.920 --> 54:52.920]  Fauci says we're out of the pandemic phase.
[54:52.920 --> 55:00.920]  Fauci confirms COVID-19 infections are at a low, but people should still get intermittently vaccinated with the non-vaccine.
[55:00.920 --> 55:04.920]  Kamala Harris tests positive for COVID, but Joe Biden not at close contact.
[55:04.920 --> 55:08.920]  She's had four shots and she's sick.
[55:08.920 --> 55:16.920]  Double vaccinated ESPN's Kirk Harbert Strite, if you pronounce that right, misses 2022 NFL draft due to blood clot.
[55:16.920 --> 55:22.920]  And it goes on and on and on.
[55:22.920 --> 55:26.920]  Another scientist who publicly dismissed lab leak gave it credence in private.
[55:26.920 --> 55:27.920]  Read that article.
[55:27.920 --> 55:28.920]  It's on m4works.com as well.
[55:28.920 --> 55:36.920]  But let me go to this clip of Biden's, which is really Obama's, not advisor, but spokesperson for the propaganda.
[55:36.920 --> 55:40.920]  It's all pre-written by the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundation and the CIA on record.
[55:40.920 --> 55:41.920]  I mean, they admit that.
[55:41.920 --> 55:45.920]  Here he is telling you, well, I mean, here, here for yourself.
[55:45.920 --> 55:53.920]  But there are some people in this country who sometimes think that we can take a domestic only approach to a global pandemic.
[55:53.920 --> 55:54.920]  That's not a thing.
[55:54.920 --> 55:56.920]  You can't do that.
[55:56.920 --> 56:00.920]  If we're going to fight a global pandemic, we have to have a global approach.
[56:00.920 --> 56:08.920]  That means we need funding to ensure that we're getting shots in arms around the world.
[56:08.920 --> 56:22.920]  A global campaign and they have the treaty to have the UN takeover all of our major governments and they have the strong cities initiative that Obama signed on to but never got implemented fully with the UN running the police review boards and the police departments with the
[56:22.920 --> 56:26.920]  Communist DA's that George Soros has put in almost every city.
[56:26.920 --> 56:33.920]  They let the fentanyl be on the street to let the illegal aliens be here to let the looting happen to defund the police.
[56:33.920 --> 56:36.920]  So the civilization and society collapsed.
[56:36.920 --> 56:39.920]  So we've lived to see it.
[56:39.920 --> 56:49.920]  We have lived to be inside the new world order with global government forced inoculations, lockdowns, pedophilia, devalued currencies, all of it.
[56:49.920 --> 56:58.920]  And it's just going to get more insane until these criminals get brought to justice by us taking back the states and the courts and the system because right now they're hiding the bureaucracy.
[56:58.920 --> 57:07.920]  They pretend like, oh, we did two years of lockdowns. We know that would cause mass starvation and they go, oh, we need more global government down to steal all the starvation or oh, your borders are collapsing.
[57:07.920 --> 57:09.920]  Because the third world's collapsing.
[57:09.920 --> 57:13.920]  Oh, the answer is more UN and more lockdowns.
[57:13.920 --> 57:19.920]  But once you get the battle plan, once you get the operation of the globalist, it's game over and that's what's starting to happen.
[57:19.920 --> 57:23.920]  But it's central to expose the great reset and to build back better agenda.
[57:23.920 --> 57:30.920]  It's essential to expose the mega corporations of BlackRock and Vanguard controlling the WEF so we can stop their agenda.
[57:30.920 --> 57:32.920]  It's like an alien showed up sort of blowing stuff up.
[57:32.920 --> 57:34.920]  We're like, oh, why are the cities blowing up? We don't know why.
[57:34.920 --> 57:36.920]  And there are the big ships attacking us.
[57:36.920 --> 57:41.920]  We have to see who's doing it in their own admissions and then organize and say no to them.
[57:41.920 --> 57:44.920]  That's why they're after us because we keep ringing an alarm.
[57:44.920 --> 57:48.920]  Hour number two at Count Dankula coming up.
[57:48.920 --> 57:54.920]  We have over a hundred designs of t-shirts that just sit there in our warehouse. We need to sell those shirts to fund the operation.
[57:54.920 --> 57:57.920]  But we'd already made some orders on future shirts coming in.
[57:57.920 --> 57:59.920]  But these are all limited editions.
[57:59.920 --> 58:01.920]  So once these new shirts come in, we're going to sell those and that's it.
[58:01.920 --> 58:04.920]  We'll have limited editions one at a time in the future.
[58:04.920 --> 58:06.920]  And when they're gone, they're gone.
[58:06.920 --> 58:08.920]  Well, here's the new limited edition shirt.
[58:08.920 --> 58:11.920]  This one is $24.95, really nice fabric.
[58:11.920 --> 58:16.920]  Alex Jones was right on the front with a big red lightning bolt on the back, infowars.com.
[58:16.920 --> 58:20.920]  You talk about triggering, you talk about spreading the word, you talk about waking people up.
[58:20.920 --> 58:21.920]  Alex Jones was right.
[58:21.920 --> 58:22.920]  Fundraiser shirt.
[58:22.920 --> 58:24.920]  We need the funds to operate.
[58:24.920 --> 58:25.920]  Infowarsstore.com.
[58:25.920 --> 58:26.920]  Alex Jones was right.

[59:54.920 --> 59:59.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[59:59.920 --> 1:00:14.920]  It's called the New World Order.
[1:00:14.920 --> 1:00:17.920]  It's called the big banks wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor.
[1:00:17.920 --> 1:00:23.920]  So they can loan us fiat money to take control of our lives with a social credit score and a universal basic income.
[1:00:23.920 --> 1:00:25.920]  That's everything.
[1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:27.920]  That's the whole future of our lives.
[1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:30.920]  The whole world is going to be about surveillance and control.
[1:00:30.920 --> 1:00:32.920]  And then manipulating and tracking everything you do.
[1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:34.920]  It's all being officially announced.
[1:00:34.920 --> 1:00:35.920]  We've got articles everywhere.
[1:00:35.920 --> 1:00:40.920]  Their press releases saying...
[1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:42.920]  And then the crew asks me during the break they go,
[1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:43.920]  Are you alright?
[1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:44.920]  You really seem upset here.
[1:00:44.920 --> 1:00:46.920]  Are you feeling okay?
[1:00:46.920 --> 1:00:48.920]  But then about that, there's war.
[1:00:48.920 --> 1:00:50.920]  I mean, we're going to starve a couple hundred million people to death.
[1:00:50.920 --> 1:00:51.920]  Yeah, I'm pretty freaked out.
[1:00:51.920 --> 1:00:53.920]  Yeah, this is real.
[1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:56.920]  This is not a freaking game to me, man.
[1:00:56.920 --> 1:01:00.920]  You don't understand what Alex is doing, right?
[1:01:00.920 --> 1:01:07.920]  People are already starving to death by the hundreds of millions right now.
[1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:08.920]  Well, you never see it on news.
[1:01:08.920 --> 1:01:10.920]  They're dying right now.
[1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:12.920]  They're in their freaking houses starving to death.
[1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:14.920]  Begging to God to help them.
[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:18.920]  And no one's coming because God tells us to get up and take action.
[1:01:18.920 --> 1:01:20.920]  And then we don't do anything.
[1:01:20.920 --> 1:01:23.920]  And that paralyzes God.
[1:01:23.920 --> 1:01:27.920]  Yeah, God can do it.
[1:01:27.920 --> 1:01:30.920]  But God needs us to do it because God's about to free will.
[1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:36.920]  Once again, for the first time what has seemed like a nudgy conspiracy theory turned out to be the truth.
[1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:37.920]  Yeah, I'm upset.
[1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:38.920]  I'm really...
[1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:39.920]  What?
[1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:40.920]  What's wrong with you?
[1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:41.920]  You're really freaked out.
[1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:43.920]  I'm like, yeah, I'm really freaked out.
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:45.920]  I'm really freaked out.
[1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:46.920]  I'm really freaked out.
[1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:48.920]  You see, because this is real.
[1:01:48.920 --> 1:01:50.920]  The supply chain being cut off.
[1:01:50.920 --> 1:01:55.920]  The energy grid being cut off real.
[1:01:55.920 --> 1:01:58.920]  And we're going into a time now where we're not going to be on the air.
[1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:02.920]  I mean, if we don't back this off, if we don't get sane people to stop the globalist,
[1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:05.920]  I mean, we won't be here in six months.
[1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:08.920]  You won't be here in six months.
[1:02:16.920 --> 1:02:19.920]  Who is the most banned news network in the world?
[1:02:19.920 --> 1:02:20.920]  Infowars.com.
[1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:21.920]  Infowars comes to mind.
[1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:23.920]  Infowars.com.
[1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:24.920]  Infowars.
[1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:25.920]  You watch Infowars?
[1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:26.920]  Infowars.
[1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:28.920]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[1:02:28.920 --> 1:02:29.920]  Alex Jones.
[1:02:29.920 --> 1:02:30.920]  Nice guy.
[1:02:30.920 --> 1:02:32.920]  He must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:33.920]  Alex Jones.
[1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:34.920]  Alex Jones.
[1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:35.920]  Alex Jones.
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:36.920]  Alex Jones.
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:37.920]  Alex Jones.
[1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:38.920]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[1:02:38.920 --> 1:02:39.920]  He knows who Infowars is.
[1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:40.920]  I'm playing this joke over here.
[1:02:40.920 --> 1:02:41.920]  That's why the new platform didn't work.
[1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:45.920]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:50.920]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:20.920]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan air defense zone.
[1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:24.920]  From the front lines of the information war.
[1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:27.920]  Plus, the bombers get the subs in launch mode.
[1:03:27.920 --> 1:03:30.920]  We are at DEF CON 1.
[1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:33.920]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[1:03:33.920 --> 1:03:34.920]  You bet.
[1:03:34.920 --> 1:03:38.920]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[1:03:38.920 --> 1:03:42.920]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[1:03:42.920 --> 1:03:46.920]  Three, two, one.
[1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:47.920]  Impact.
[1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:49.920]  Shall we play a game?
[1:03:49.920 --> 1:03:55.920]  How about global or no nuclear war?
[1:03:55.920 --> 1:04:00.920]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:03.920]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready, awaiting launch codes.
[1:04:03.920 --> 1:04:05.920]  We are at launch mode.
[1:04:05.920 --> 1:04:09.920]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:13.920]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:04:13.920 --> 1:04:15.920]  We're in.
[1:04:15.920 --> 1:04:17.920]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[1:04:17.920 --> 1:04:19.920]  We have Soviet submarine launch detection.
[1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:21.920]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[1:04:21.920 --> 1:04:23.920]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[1:04:23.920 --> 1:04:25.920]  Then we end.
[1:04:25.920 --> 1:04:40.920]  The opening code is not to blame.
[1:04:55.920 --> 1:05:06.920]  Over the years, Infowars has produced more than 200 amazing, patriot, Americana,
[1:05:06.920 --> 1:05:11.920]  Second Amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts, ball caps, flags.
[1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:12.920]  You name it.
[1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:16.920]  All of the apparel and the flags are being sold at cost right now.
[1:05:16.920 --> 1:05:18.920]  That's just regular plain chain shirts.
[1:05:18.920 --> 1:05:24.920]  That is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[1:05:24.920 --> 1:05:25.920]  We used to sell for $40.
[1:05:25.920 --> 1:05:28.920]  We're selling them for $15, selling them for $20, whatever the shirt costs us.
[1:05:28.920 --> 1:05:32.920]  If a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5 for us to actually produce.
[1:05:32.920 --> 1:05:34.920]  If it costs $10, we're selling it for $10.
[1:05:34.920 --> 1:05:38.920]  And we've got hoodies, and we've got long sleeves, and we've got short sleeves.
[1:05:38.920 --> 1:05:40.920]  We've got them all, and we've got to liquidate them all.
[1:05:40.920 --> 1:05:45.920]  And they're limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs again.
[1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:50.920]  We are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[1:05:50.920 --> 1:05:54.920]  We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air, plus it spreads the word.
[1:05:54.920 --> 1:06:23.920]  infoworkstore.com, your historic apparel now, infoworkstore.com.
[1:06:23.920 --> 1:06:30.920]  Well, I couldn't think of a better person to have on this April 27th Wednesday transmission
[1:06:30.920 --> 1:06:37.920]  than an amazing comedian, a great talk show host, and a good friend of mine, Count Dankula.
[1:06:37.920 --> 1:06:43.920]  He was arrested, he was charged, he was tried for making a joke with his pug,
[1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:53.920]  Highling Hitler, which is similar to things that John Cleese did, not even as funny as Count Dankula, on national British television.
[1:06:53.920 --> 1:06:58.920]  But make a joke about Hitler, something that all the leftists can do.
[1:06:58.920 --> 1:07:08.920]  And you, ladies and gentlemen, go to jail in the UK, and we have the UK and the EU coming out and telling Elon Musk,
[1:07:08.920 --> 1:07:14.920]  we don't care what you do, we're going to arrest you if you let people have free speech.
[1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:20.920]  And the view and others have come out and said that Elon Musk is a Nazi.
[1:07:20.920 --> 1:07:22.920]  Yes, because he wants free speech.
[1:07:22.920 --> 1:07:24.920]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[1:07:24.920 --> 1:07:26.920]  Musk slams anti-free speech authoritarians.
[1:07:26.920 --> 1:07:31.920]  I'm against a ship that goes far beyond the law, which is section 230.
[1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:36.920]  You call for killing somebody, you post child porn, you go to jail.
[1:07:36.920 --> 1:07:40.920]  If it's illegal, well, then you aren't allowed to do it.
[1:07:40.920 --> 1:07:42.920]  It is a utility.
[1:07:42.920 --> 1:07:49.920]  Now I've got stacks of videos and articles with Clinton appointees and Obama appointees, Robert Reich, you name it, saying,
[1:07:49.920 --> 1:07:50.920]  well, it's a utility.
[1:07:50.920 --> 1:07:52.920]  We got to be able to say whatever we want.
[1:07:52.920 --> 1:07:55.920]  Well, yeah, Musk isn't going to censor you.
[1:07:55.920 --> 1:08:00.920]  He's saying, we're going to let us have a free for all, but you leftist can't win a debate.
[1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:01.920]  I wouldn't say I'm a right winger.
[1:08:01.920 --> 1:08:02.920]  They call me one.
[1:08:02.920 --> 1:08:05.920]  I'm an anti-war libertarian overall, but I am a Christian.
[1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:06.920]  Count Dankle.
[1:08:06.920 --> 1:08:09.920]  I wouldn't call him a right winger, but it doesn't matter.
[1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:13.920]  They want to silence who's popular because they don't want populism.
[1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:18.920]  EU threatens Musk, says it's not your rules which apply here.
[1:08:18.920 --> 1:08:21.920]  Elon Musk responds to Russian collusion hoaxers.
[1:08:21.920 --> 1:08:27.920]  Currently working at Twitter, who put out fake reports about Russia that have approved me lies, points to big changes.
[1:08:27.920 --> 1:08:29.920]  The response is to say he's a Russian agent.
[1:08:29.920 --> 1:08:31.920]  Babylon B puts out the satire piece.
[1:08:31.920 --> 1:08:39.920]  Musk's Twitter purchases fails after 138,000 board member votes found overnight.
[1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:43.920]  It didn't really happen, but it's just like the election.
[1:08:43.920 --> 1:08:45.920]  Here's Robert Reich I mentioned.
[1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:50.920]  Musk and his apologists say if consumers don't like what he does with Twitter, then you go elsewhere.
[1:08:50.920 --> 1:08:55.920]  But where else do consumers go to post short messages that can reach millions of people other than Twitter?
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:08:58.920]  The free market increasingly reflects the demands of big money.
[1:08:58.920 --> 1:09:05.920]  Oh, so big money owned it before wouldn't let conservatives, 96 to 4, that's a big study here, have free speech.
[1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:09.920]  But when he says everybody gets it, that's now censorship.
[1:09:09.920 --> 1:09:13.920]  See, censorship for the authoritarian left is free speech.
[1:09:13.920 --> 1:09:18.920]  Tech employees are much more liberal than their employers, at least so far as the candidates they support.
[1:09:18.920 --> 1:09:19.920]  Here's some of the reports.
[1:09:19.920 --> 1:09:20.920]  I said 96%.
[1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:22.920]  It's 98.7%.
[1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:26.920]  And the censorship is 96% against conservatives.
[1:09:26.920 --> 1:09:28.920]  And it goes on and on and on.
[1:09:28.920 --> 1:09:33.920]  With Bill Gates not being popular, McCron being hit with tomatoes, they are gaslighting us.
[1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:40.920]  And to talk about it all is the mighty Count Dancula, host of mad lads and some of my favorite shows.
[1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:45.920]  YouTuber, comedian, free speech activists on Twitter at Count Dancula TV on YouTube.
[1:09:45.920 --> 1:09:50.920]  Count Dancula will talk about Musk takes down the censors and so much more.
[1:09:50.920 --> 1:09:52.920]  Good to have you here, Count.
[1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:55.920]  Last time you were on with us was a couple of years ago in studio.
[1:09:55.920 --> 1:09:58.920]  Yeah, it's been a little while since I've been back.
[1:09:58.920 --> 1:09:59.920]  It's good to be back.
[1:09:59.920 --> 1:10:02.920]  Long time no see, Alex.
[1:10:02.920 --> 1:10:08.920]  Man, what a crazy world, bro, because you and I were like the carries the coal mine and now this stuff's crazy.
[1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:13.920]  One of the things that you were pointing out there, see how that Robert Reich tweet that you were just talking about there,
[1:10:13.920 --> 1:10:18.920]  there was a reply he made under it to his own tweet where he used the term platform monopoly.
[1:10:18.920 --> 1:10:23.920]  Now, platform monopoly was a term that I started using years ago when you went through your great unpersoning,
[1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:28.920]  where all of big tech came together and just decided, you know, Alex Jones doesn't exist anymore.
[1:10:28.920 --> 1:10:34.920]  I used the term platform monopoly to show that why collusion of big tech Silicon Valley,
[1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:39.920]  you know, who control the online speech of about 80% of the English speaking world,
[1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:43.920]  why it's such a dangerous thing for them to all be working together and to have a monopoly.
[1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:47.920]  And one thing that I've said for years and years and years, whenever I'm arguing where it left this online,
[1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:52.920]  is when it comes to the monopolization of information, the only reason you support it right now
[1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:56.920]  is because it works in your favor. But if it was the other way around,
[1:10:56.920 --> 1:10:59.920]  then you would all be making the exact same arguments we are.
[1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:03.920]  And Robert Reich was one of the people that said, use the phrase platform monopoly,
[1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:07.920]  use the exact same arguments that we're all making. And I've seen them all do it going on.
[1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:12.920]  It's very, very dangerous when someone with such a bias owns a tech media platform,
[1:11:12.920 --> 1:11:17.920]  it'll be full of misinformation and censorship and all leftists are going to get this and that done to them.
[1:11:17.920 --> 1:11:22.920]  And we were all just sort of sitting there going, yeah, that does sound awful,
[1:11:22.920 --> 1:11:26.920]  even though that's literally what we've all been living through for the last four years.
[1:11:26.920 --> 1:11:30.920]  Yeah, they haven't arrested me yet for my speech. They have you. And last time I checked, how much do you have to spend?
[1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:33.920]  I mean, how did that all end?
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:41.920]  Oh, it's all over now. I got caught out in a complete catch 22 because I was going to take my case to the European Court of Human Rights.
[1:11:41.920 --> 1:11:49.920]  But the way that the system worked is it was a complete catch 22. I did not file the case in time.
[1:11:49.920 --> 1:11:56.920]  But in order to file the case in time, I wouldn't have been able to meet the requirements to actually file my case.
[1:11:56.920 --> 1:11:59.920]  So no matter what I did, I was completely screwed.
[1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:07.920]  But I've got I've got about £40,000 left from the fundraiser, the fundraiser we did to fund my legal defence.
[1:12:07.920 --> 1:12:14.920]  And I have been spending the last three weeks trying to find charities to donate the £40,000 to.
[1:12:14.920 --> 1:12:21.920]  But because the money is coming from me, every single charity has rejected me. All of them.
[1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:26.920]  Incredible. Incredible. And we'll try to find it and put it on screen live or later in post.
[1:12:26.920 --> 1:12:32.920]  We posted a video about the famous images of you coming out of court. There it is thumb. I mean, that is that's powerful.
[1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:37.920]  That's my rest. That's my rest. They're dragging me out my house.
[1:12:37.920 --> 1:12:40.920]  That's all the court was similar when you put your thumbs up, right?
[1:12:40.920 --> 1:12:46.920]  Yeah, I was waving and smiling as I came out the court because I was expecting to go to prison.
[1:12:46.920 --> 1:12:49.920]  I was fully expecting for them to try and make an example.
[1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:53.920]  And that was you getting your pug to Hal Hitler. It was funny.
[1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:58.920]  Yeah, it was a joke. Like anyone with two brain cells knows that that video was a joke.
[1:12:58.920 --> 1:13:08.920]  But the government saw a excellent, excellent chance to set an example for people who might dare to make, you know, such funny edgy jokes in future.
[1:13:08.920 --> 1:13:16.920]  It was a scare tactic. It was a sort of display of like, even though that picture of me getting led out my house in handcuffs.
[1:13:16.920 --> 1:13:26.920]  The reason that the reporters were actually there is because the police illegally tipped them off as to the exact date and time of the arrest because they wanted a perp walk.
[1:13:26.920 --> 1:13:29.920]  They were like, look at this big, bad white supremacist Nazi that we've caught.
[1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:32.920]  This is what will happen to you if you dare to do the same thing.
[1:13:32.920 --> 1:13:36.920]  Meanwhile, there's a lot of media out there, but I watch your stuff at least every week.
[1:13:36.920 --> 1:13:42.920]  Every time Mad Lads comes out, I would not even describe you as a right winger. That's what's ridiculous about this.
[1:13:42.920 --> 1:13:48.920]  I'm Libertarian. I'm Libertarian. I'm anti-war, anti-state. You know, I read a lot of Rothbard.
[1:13:48.920 --> 1:13:55.920]  I read a lot of Hans Hermann Hopper. I wouldn't even really consider myself right-wing.
[1:13:55.920 --> 1:13:59.920]  But, you know, back in the 90s, I would be considered a leftist.
[1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:02.920]  If we were back in the 90s, I would be considered a leftist.
[1:14:02.920 --> 1:14:05.920]  Well, yeah, the leftists under the 90s were like, anti-war, pro-free speech.
[1:14:05.920 --> 1:14:09.920]  I mean, other than abortion and stuff, I agree with them. They were all really cool and you'd drink beer with them.
[1:14:09.920 --> 1:14:11.920]  Now they want to kill me.
[1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:15.920]  Yeah, yeah. It's weird, just everything.
[1:14:15.920 --> 1:14:17.920]  I don't have no idea what the hell went wrong.
[1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:24.920]  When you look back at all like the Great League, I consider leftist comedians, you know, you've got George Carlin, you've got Bill Hex and stuff like that.
[1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:31.920]  Obviously, I always have to think to myself, what would they think about what modern leftism has become?
[1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:33.920]  I mean, even Bill Maher.
[1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:37.920]  Bill Maher is completely fed up with the modern left.
[1:14:37.920 --> 1:14:43.920]  He can't stand it anymore and he now spends an awful lot of his show, you know, dunking on what the modern left has become.
[1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:45.920]  I mean, it has become a joke.
[1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:48.920]  Like, everything is an extreme, you know.
[1:14:48.920 --> 1:14:55.920]  If anyone is, like, even the tiniest, slightest little bit to the right, there are Nazi fascist Uber mega-Hitler.
[1:14:55.920 --> 1:14:59.920]  You know, just because they're like, maybe we should have some checks at the border.
[1:14:59.920 --> 1:15:03.920]  Maybe some, you know, just to make sure we're not letting any rapists or criminal gangs in.
[1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:08.920]  But apparently, just by you wanting that, you know, you're the second coming of Adolf Hitler.
[1:15:08.920 --> 1:15:11.920]  I don't understand. Everything's exaggerated.
[1:15:11.920 --> 1:15:14.920]  I want to ask you when you come back where you think it's all going.
[1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:18.920]  Because I asked Gavin McGinnis a long time ago, like six years ago, what's peak leftism.
[1:15:18.920 --> 1:15:22.920]  He said it's going to go a long way, but I think we're getting close to what's happened at Twitter.
[1:15:22.920 --> 1:15:24.920]  Eon Musk, what do you expect to happen next?
[1:15:24.920 --> 1:15:26.920]  What's happening in the U.K.?
[1:15:26.920 --> 1:15:28.920]  What's happening with the Russia-Ukraine situation?
[1:15:28.920 --> 1:15:31.920]  All of this will be covered with Count Dankul on the other side.
[1:15:31.920 --> 1:15:33.920]  But 20 seconds.
[1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:35.920]  I haven't checked your site in the last week.
[1:15:35.920 --> 1:15:38.920]  What's your latest mad-lad piece?
[1:15:38.920 --> 1:15:43.920]  The latest mad-lad video I uploaded was actually the Washington Sniper.
[1:15:43.920 --> 1:15:45.920]  I did a video on the Washington Sniper.
[1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:46.920]  That was that.
[1:15:46.920 --> 1:15:49.920]  Well, I'm not going to say a fun one, but it was an interesting one.
[1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:52.920]  Well, I'm a big fan. Count Dankul as our guest will be right back in a few minutes.
[1:15:52.920 --> 1:16:14.920]  Please stay with us.
[1:16:23.920 --> 1:16:27.920]  We're selling them for $15, selling them for $20, whatever the shirt costs.
[1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:31.920]  If a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5 for us to actually produce.
[1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:33.920]  If it costs $10, we're selling it for $10.
[1:16:33.920 --> 1:16:37.920]  And we've got hoodies, and we've got long sleeves, and we've got short sleeves.

[1:17:30.920 --> 1:17:35.920]  But because of the cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else,

[1:20:18.920 --> 1:20:28.920]  It could be okay with countless other comedians and leftists of the past and John Cleese and Lonnie Python, but not when Count Dankula did it.
[1:20:28.920 --> 1:20:32.920]  Zeke Hiles. Who's a good wee Nazi?
[1:20:32.920 --> 1:20:37.920]  Buddha. Do I gas the juice? Do I gas the juice?
[1:20:37.920 --> 1:20:39.920]  Mum will gas the juice, son.
[1:20:39.920 --> 1:20:52.920]  My girlfriend is always ranting and raving about how cute and adorable her wee dog is, and so I thought I would turn them into the least cute thing that I could think of, which is a Nazi.
[1:20:52.920 --> 1:21:11.920]  What I gas the juice?
[1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:19.920]  I'm not racist, by the way. I just really, really wanted to f**k her off.
[1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:25.920]  Mark, Mark, tell me, have you got anybody?
[1:21:25.920 --> 1:21:33.920]  So that's the Sky News edit without the really funny parts in there, but just imagine, folks, if you can arrest somebody for that, what could you not do?
[1:21:33.920 --> 1:21:40.920]  Getting back to Count Dankula here, great comedian, great talk show host, Elon Musk. I wanted you on about this even before it was unfolding.
[1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:44.920]  I wanted you on about free speech a few weeks ago. You're finally able to come on perfect timing.
[1:21:44.920 --> 1:21:48.920]  What do you make of Musk? What do you think of Musk? Where do you think this is going?
[1:21:48.920 --> 1:21:54.920]  I do think he has a good head on his shoulders when it comes to freedom of speech and the exchange of ideas.
[1:21:54.920 --> 1:21:59.920]  I hope that he's definitely going to do good things for the platform, however it remains to be seen.
[1:21:59.920 --> 1:22:10.920]  I've been through far too much in the last five years to allow myself to get hopeful for anything, so I'm going to do a wait back and see approach, but obviously support him in any way that I would be able to.
[1:22:10.920 --> 1:22:18.920]  But one of the key things that I'm noticing as well is that everyone is saying that billionaires shouldn't be allowed to own social media platforms.
[1:22:18.920 --> 1:22:25.920]  Well, I'm sorry, but since their inception, all social media platforms have been owned by billionaires. They all already own them.
[1:22:25.920 --> 1:22:29.920]  You just don't like this billionaire that's owning this one.
[1:22:29.920 --> 1:22:38.920]  One of the arguments that people are saying, and I'm fed up of hearing this, is that this is a threat to our democracy.
[1:22:38.920 --> 1:22:47.920]  In my understanding, the way I was raised in my understanding of democracy is democracy is when people are allowed to make an informed vote in a parliamentary system.
[1:22:47.920 --> 1:22:54.920]  So you've got two candidates that are running for office and the public get to decide who they vote for, but their vote has to be informed.
[1:22:54.920 --> 1:22:59.920]  Both candidates have to give both their sides of the story and tell the public why they should be able to vote for them.
[1:22:59.920 --> 1:23:09.920]  So if you are not allowing one of the candidates to even speak and present their arguments to actually have a chance of winning any votes, well, then that means you are undemocratic.
[1:23:09.920 --> 1:23:21.920]  You don't believe in the democratic process. Instead, you just see it as a convenient means to an end while you use your control of social media to brainwash everybody into voting for the candidate that you personally want.
[1:23:21.920 --> 1:23:33.920]  So see if you have control over the megaphone and you don't share it with anyone, then that is undemocratic. So if you don't believe in freedom of speech, then you also don't believe in democracy.
[1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:42.920]  And that's why they are so upset about this. They are terrified of the fact that their ideas will now have to compete on a level playing field.
[1:23:42.920 --> 1:23:51.920]  They are worried that the fight will be fair and the reason that they are worried about that is in a fair fight, they are not going to win.
[1:23:51.920 --> 1:24:06.920]  Beautifully said. Let me play you, Artie Melbourne, a MSNBC host and Democratic Party operative, inverting and projecting and gaslighting about everything they've done, fixing elections, 96% monopolies.
[1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:12.920]  And then he's saying that's what's going to happen if Musk allows freedom here it is.
[1:24:12.920 --> 1:24:17.920]  You own all of Twitter or Facebook or what have you. You don't have to explain yourself. You don't even have to be transparent.
[1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:28.920]  You could secretly ban one party's candidate or all of its candidates, all of its nominees, or you could just secretly turn down the reach of their stuff and turn up the reach of something else.
[1:24:28.920 --> 1:24:33.920]  And the rest of us might not even find out about it till after the election.
[1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:43.920]  Elon Musk says this is all to help people because he is just a free speech, philosophically clear, open-minded helper.
[1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:51.920]  Lord Dankula, what do you make of that? That has got to be the most inverted where he's telling you what they've been doing and then acting like we're going to do it.
[1:24:51.920 --> 1:25:02.920]  Yeah, it sounds very familiar. Everything he said there sounded extremely familiar. It almost feels like that's what we've been going through for the last four or five years.
[1:25:02.920 --> 1:25:10.920]  Basically, it got to the point where, you know, whenever anything came out about Trump, you were allowed to say any wild thing that you wanted to about Trump.
[1:25:10.920 --> 1:25:17.920]  You could say anything, you know, like the Russia was at Piscay or whatever they called it. That was spread far and wide all over the place.
[1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:27.920]  Mention anything about a certain laptop or certain vehicles with some boxes, votes turning up at four o'clock in the morning and you were banned.
[1:25:27.920 --> 1:25:36.920]  And also other things as well. If you said anything about, you know, certain parts of the COVID vaccine or, you know, where the origins of the virus, you were banned.
[1:25:36.920 --> 1:25:42.920]  You were removed. You were not allowed to talk about these things, even though some of the stuff about COVID later turned out to be true.
[1:25:42.920 --> 1:25:47.920]  The accounts that said the original true stuff were still left banned.
[1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:57.920]  Right. And it's just, it is a case of they enjoyed the system because it was so one sided. It worked so well in their favor. They were like, because the Biden laptop stuff was damning.
[1:25:57.920 --> 1:26:03.920]  It was absolutely damning. And they knew that it was going to be a massive problem and they'll lead up to their election. So what did they do?
[1:26:03.920 --> 1:26:10.920]  They stifled absolutely everything about the laptop and then they made, they made damn sure that they got rid of Project Veritas as soon as they could.
[1:26:10.920 --> 1:26:13.920]  Yeah, the FBI raided them.
[1:26:13.920 --> 1:26:22.920]  Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And that was a, what was it over? There was a certain diary that was found as well. And that was what instigated the FBI raid.
[1:26:22.920 --> 1:26:30.920]  But it's a case of they don't like it when people, when the other side has the same power they do to be able to question them.
[1:26:30.920 --> 1:26:36.920]  They don't like that. There are certain things that people might want to point out or certain points that people might want to make.
[1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:43.920]  If it's going to be damning to the Democrats or those that are in power, then they're not going to let them do it. And that's why their control of Twitter was such a convenient tool.
[1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:49.920]  Because not only could you ban people in silence, people from being on the platform and actually getting the word out there.
[1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:56.920]  But you could also tweak the algorithms so that people only saw specific information that you wanted them to see.
[1:26:56.920 --> 1:27:01.920]  You know, things that would very slightly over time make them lean further and further and further to the left.
[1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:06.920]  And it would be all this stuff like Republicans evil, Republicans eat babies, Republicans are going to...
[1:27:06.920 --> 1:27:12.920]  Or the vaccine totally works or the lockdowns are good or the mass totally work, all lies. So let me ask you this.
[1:27:12.920 --> 1:27:19.920]  Obviously, I mean, tell me to disagree. I think the worm is turning. I think the pendulum has begun to kind of stop.
[1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:23.920]  It's about to swing back. You think that's an accurate statement? And what happens once it swings back?
[1:27:23.920 --> 1:27:32.920]  Yeah, I'm seeing it all over the place. See when Elon Musk bought Twitter after some of the things he was saying about freedom of speech.
[1:27:32.920 --> 1:27:39.920]  For example, the New York Times were banned for posting the Hunter laptop story.
[1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:44.920]  And Elon Musk made a reply to the tweet saying, yes, that's a very bad thing.
[1:27:44.920 --> 1:27:46.920]  Yeah, New York Post, absolutely. He's saying that's wrong.
[1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:54.920]  Yeah, that was it, basically. So seeing things like that and now knowing that Elon Musk owns Twitter, that was a white-pilling moment for me.
[1:27:54.920 --> 1:28:02.920]  It made me think, we are actually going to be able to see how the whole free marketplace of ideas, you know, that thing that left us always rolled our eyes at.
[1:28:02.920 --> 1:28:08.920]  Because they say it's a system that doesn't work. Well, the reason that they don't believe the system works is because they never win in it.
[1:28:08.920 --> 1:28:17.920]  You know, it's like saying that boxing matches proved who is the best fighter. But if leftists are always losing, they're saying, boxing doesn't work. Boxing doesn't show who's the best fighter.
[1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:22.920]  You know, they need a handicap. You know, they need stabilizers on their ideas to help them through.
[1:28:22.920 --> 1:28:28.920]  And the fact that Elon Musk is now bought Twitter and seems to be very focused on freedom of speech, that's what's making them all panic so much.
[1:28:28.920 --> 1:28:33.920]  That's a great analogy. You want to come back with that? It's like, you can't beat Mike Tyson as prime, so you bring a shotgun.
[1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:39.920]  And that's the left. They brought a shotgun to fight Mike Tyson. I don't blame him, but liberty and freedom is too sexy.
[1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:49.920]  Oh, no, it's different. Instead, what they did is instead of actually allowing the boxing match to happen, they instead dug up Mike Tyson's old tweets and got him banned from even boxing in the match.
[1:28:49.920 --> 1:28:53.920]  Exactly. Stay there, Count. Thank you. You are on fire, as usual. We'll be right back.
[1:28:53.920 --> 1:29:06.920]  There's about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand in for worse. I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:12.920]  I wanted to hire camera people. I wanted to make films. I wanted to really challenge the globalist. And it was a t-shirt I designed.
[1:29:12.920 --> 1:29:19.920]  The first one, mass murderers agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first three members of my crew.
[1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:28.920]  That's our oldest design and we're still selling. We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions because whatever stock we've got in, that's it.
[1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:34.920]  We're selling everything out to fund the operation to get rid of inventory. We'll still have some teachers in the future.
[1:29:34.920 --> 1:29:40.920]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs. So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[1:29:40.920 --> 1:29:56.920]  I almost forgot. We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com. Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts, they're all selling at cost infowarstore.com.
[1:30:10.920 --> 1:30:17.920]  We'll have limited editions one at a time in the future and when they're gone, they're gone. Well, here's the new limited edition shirt.
[1:30:17.920 --> 1:30:25.920]  This one is $24.95, really nice fabric. Alex Jones was right on the front with a big red lightning bolt on the back, infowarstore.com.

[1:30:57.920 --> 1:31:12.920]  Introducing the newest product from infowarslife.com. We are so proud of Infowar's Life immune support. It is concentrated herbs that are known on record to supercharge our body's natural defenses.
[1:31:12.920 --> 1:31:20.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is something that is essential and everyone should get. And on top of it, it funds the Infowar, so that's a 360 win.
[1:31:20.920 --> 1:31:31.920]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product. Concentrated elderberry, concentrated echinacea, concentrated astragalus root, angelica root, loatium root, and more.
[1:31:31.920 --> 1:31:41.920]  This product is incredible. Infowar's immune support, exclusively available at infowarstore.com, is funding the tip of the spear, the Infowar's operation.
[1:31:41.920 --> 1:31:50.920]  It is a 360 win. The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's natural defenses and keep infowars on the air.
[1:31:50.920 --> 1:32:17.920]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action. Take action now. Infowarstore.com.
[1:32:17.920 --> 1:32:32.920]  Because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[1:32:32.920 --> 1:32:48.920]  So it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever. The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover. Like Canada, where they've now declared a civil emergency in Marshall Law in Ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[1:32:48.920 --> 1:32:59.920]  So pray for these folks big time. This is a very serious situation and stay tuned into infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[1:32:59.920 --> 1:33:11.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:22.920]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:22.920 --> 1:33:30.920]  Well, the great Count Nicola is our guest. We're talking about free speech and where all this goes. He agreed with me that the pendulum is basically stopped.
[1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:37.920]  It's swinging back and forth. There's that moment where it just stops and now it's beginning to come back. What is that going to look like?
[1:33:37.920 --> 1:33:43.920]  We don't want to behave like the left and act like them. We don't want to censor them. They're claiming Musk is going to do that, but he said no.
[1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:51.920]  While this is not illegal, we're going to do it. That's what freedom is all about. So Count Nicola, what are your predictions, my friend?
[1:33:51.920 --> 1:34:02.920]  What we're going to see over the next year, if Musk goes ahead and does what he proposes that he's actually going to do, is our ideas competing on a level of playing field.
[1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:10.920]  We will see, most likely, an increase in voters. However, I believe that was going to happen anyway because of the absolutely awful job Biden's doing.
[1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:22.920]  But I believe we are going to see a lot more people coming to the right wing or centrism or just being standard libertarians and stuff like that as well.
[1:34:22.920 --> 1:34:31.920]  Without the censorship going on, I think things are going to get a lot more sensible because after 2016, the internet and so many different websites became just a complete nightmare.
[1:34:31.920 --> 1:34:40.920]  I mentioned Trump's name and everyone started wrothing at the mouth like a shark where a drop of blood in the water. Everybody freaked out.
[1:34:40.920 --> 1:34:49.920]  I think that over time, all of that is going to calm down a lot. I think all the everything's Nazi, everything's racist, everything's fascist stuff is going to calm down.
[1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:54.920]  I'm feeling a little bit hopeful because ideas will now be able to bounce off each other.
[1:34:54.920 --> 1:35:01.920]  Because again, I like the free marketplace of ideas. That way, the best ideas rise to the top. If something's a bad idea, then the public will reject it.
[1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:03.920]  If it's a good idea, then the public will take it.
[1:35:03.920 --> 1:35:13.920]  But as for showing that a lot of people have an issue with, oh, but you're going to give free speech to socialists and communists and leftists, the people who would take your free speech away from you.
[1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:19.920]  And as a case of yes, I would offer that because you know that famous clip, would you get rid of the law to get at the devil?
[1:35:19.920 --> 1:35:30.920]  It's one of my favorite clips and I enjoy that. And the reason for that is I want people to be able to experience and depreciate how much better things can be in a fair system.
[1:35:30.920 --> 1:35:36.920]  It's a case of, you know, you can see if you start censoring people, you know, as we know, then they get painted as a victim.
[1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:44.920]  When you censor and attack people and take away their voice, infrastructure then gets built by that certain political sphere to support and boost them.
[1:35:44.920 --> 1:35:51.920]  I mean, look what happened to Libs of Tiktok, right? That was a hardcore cancellation by Taylor Lorenz.
[1:35:51.920 --> 1:35:54.920]  And for those that know the story, recap it for them.
[1:35:54.920 --> 1:36:08.920]  Oh, yeah. Libs of Tiktok is a Twitter account that likes to take, you know, liberals who are on Tiktok who say wild and crazy things and essentially just post their exact own words on Twitter.
[1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:15.920]  That's all she does, right? She takes what these people have said and post them on Twitter. That's it. That's all she does.
[1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:23.920]  They say we're going to have sex with your children. We're going to take your guns. We're going to destroy America. I mean, you show what they're saying.
[1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:30.920]  Yeah, yeah. It's just basically like, these are the words out of their own mouth and everyone's like, oh, but they're making liberals look bad.
[1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:38.920]  And it's like, no, this is them saying it. She didn't say it. The liberals said it. She just showed it to more people, right?
[1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:43.920]  If people didn't like it, well, there you go. There's a free marketplace of ideas. People didn't like what this person said.
[1:36:43.920 --> 1:36:47.920]  And so they've rejected it or they're mocking the person or making fun of them and all that other time.
[1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:54.920]  And then she has the nerve to say that if people criticize her, it's censorship and an attack, but then she's doxing people. It's ridiculous.
[1:36:54.920 --> 1:37:02.920]  Oh, yeah, yeah. Just just two weeks before she did it, she says, oh, online harassment is terrible and doxing is terrible and people try and get your private information.
[1:37:02.920 --> 1:37:12.920]  And then she turns up at Libs of Tiktok's house and the homes of her family members and everyone. So basically, like, she didn't mean a thing, but she loves doxing.
[1:37:12.920 --> 1:37:21.920]  You know, it's this whole hypocritical thing where or doxing doxing is fine when we do it because our enemies are bad and we are the good guys.
[1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:30.920]  So horrible things. It's okay to do that to our enemies. But when it happened to Taylor Lorenz, she was freaking out about it and crying about it and all that type of stuff as well.
[1:37:30.920 --> 1:37:43.920]  But when they tried to cancel Libs of Tiktok, instead, it was the same thing that happened to me, you know, that the Streisand effect kicked in and Libs of Tiktok absolutely exploded in popularity and was getting support from everyone.
[1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:53.920]  So see the whole cancellation and attempted censorship stuff. It doesn't work because we've been going through the censorship thing for like the last five, six years, right?
[1:37:53.920 --> 1:37:59.920]  And we are all still going really, really strong because we built infrastructure to support each other whenever we get canceled.
[1:37:59.920 --> 1:38:07.920]  If we do the same to the communists and the socialists, the exact same thing will happen. They will do the exact same thing and then they'll be able to play themselves.
[1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:19.920]  I agree. We don't want to censor them because we want to expose their ideas. Let me ask you this. With Netflix imploding, with CNN in one month, CNN Plus closing, 300 million investment failure, everything they're doing is dying.
[1:38:19.920 --> 1:38:26.920]  Didn't they get, Twitter was dying, that by censoring real debate, it makes it very, very boring. We just left this on every day. None of them will come on.
[1:38:26.920 --> 1:38:34.920]  Tucker Carlson built his brand. They would come on. Now they won't. They just won't debate even if it's a big show. They can't defend their ideas.
[1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:46.920]  So where do you see it going with all the corporate media and Hollywood literally dying? They attempted to shut us up hoping that would save them, but instead it just accelerated their destruction.
[1:38:46.920 --> 1:38:58.920]  Well, exactly this has happened before and it all stemmed from the censorship itself, right? Old school Hollywood way, way back in the day, you know, the 30s, 40s and 50s had a thing called the Hayes Code.
[1:38:58.920 --> 1:39:09.920]  I don't know if you've heard of it and basically the Hayes Code was a moral code put on the media to prevent, you know, stop people from having bad morals and to stop a moral shift in society.
[1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:17.920]  So the Hayes Code had things, you know, like no sexual, no sexual things on screen, you know, bad guys always have to get their comeuppance.
[1:39:17.920 --> 1:39:22.920]  No interracial kissing or romance at all. Couples were not allowed to sleep in the same bed.
[1:39:22.920 --> 1:39:28.920]  All manners of different type of rules to preserve the morality or the political message that they wanted to push at the time.
[1:39:28.920 --> 1:39:38.920]  All that happened after a couple of decades of that is people were getting sick and getting preached to people were getting sick of media constantly telling them this is the way society should be.
[1:39:38.920 --> 1:39:44.920]  Exactly. It created the 60s and made people wild because of the push the other way.
[1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:55.920]  Yep, exactly. So basically everyone stopped consuming the media because people were like, I don't want to be preached to and told that I'm awful and told that I'm terrible and told how I should live my life.
[1:39:55.920 --> 1:40:04.920]  I just want to see a good movie. Right. And what ended up happening was foreign films that didn't abide by the Hayes Code were outperforming all of the American movies.
[1:40:04.920 --> 1:40:10.920]  Right. So everybody, whenever people got sick of being preached to all the time, they went elsewhere for their entertainment.
[1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:17.920]  And that's exactly what happened. CNN Plus crashed because nobody wants to watch it. Netflix crashed because nobody wants to watch it.
[1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:28.920]  Count Angela, perfect analogy and historical parallel. So with that big 10 pound brain, what is going to happen as they realize that they failed? What are they going to do?
[1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:35.920]  Panic. They're going to panic. I don't know. I don't know where it's going to go from here. I don't know what they would be capable of.
[1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:43.920]  I think they're already trying to draw links between Musk and China. They're trying to pull out that old chestnut as well.
[1:40:43.920 --> 1:40:51.920]  I was saying, oh, he's bought by China. He's a Putin puppet and all this other type of stuff as well. So they're just going to do the same as they've done for the last five, six years.
[1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:53.920]  They're just going to lie, exaggerate.
[1:40:53.920 --> 1:41:00.920]  I agree. That's what losers do. They keep running the same playbook even though it fails. So what do you think that happens in a year or two? What happens?
[1:41:00.920 --> 1:41:12.920]  I think it's the problem is they've played that hand far too many times that people just see right through it. Like, do you remember in 2014 when someone got called a racist or a Nazi?
[1:41:12.920 --> 1:41:24.920]  You immediately believed it and it was a terrible, awful thing. But now in 2022, whenever you hear, oh, this guy's a racist or a Nazi, that your mind now goes to, okay, so he's someone who disagrees with the left.
[1:41:24.920 --> 1:41:32.920]  Right, because it gets overused, it gets overplayed. So see when they come out with their lies and exaggerations and discreditations, nobody's going to believe it.
[1:41:32.920 --> 1:41:41.920]  It's not going to be as hard-hitting as it used to be because they've overdone it. You know that the boy has cried will far too many times and now no one believes him.
[1:41:41.920 --> 1:41:54.920]  I totally agree. That's really positive outlook and I agree. But what about the wildcards? We're going to break, come back to inflation, war. In 60 seconds, we're going to break. What's your view on the Ukraine situation?
[1:41:54.920 --> 1:42:03.920]  I've personally completely tuned out of it because I don't believe anything that is coming out of it because everybody knows that whenever there's a war, there's going to be propaganda.
[1:42:03.920 --> 1:42:16.920]  And what propaganda is, is two sides competing to see who can tell the most convincing lies, which is why Western media, Eastern media, Russian media, British media, American media, anything they say about the war.
[1:42:16.920 --> 1:42:19.920]  You're a giant life vest.
[1:42:19.920 --> 1:42:33.920]  Yeah, absolutely. And now that's a case of, it's not even a case of because America bad, Russia bad, blah, blah. That's every single country. Look at every single country in history. When they go to war, they all lie their heads off. They all lie constantly.
[1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:42.920]  So, you know, it's just the way war goes. And if that's the way it goes, then I'm just not going to take part. That's why I've not been following it, not been listening to it.
[1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:54.920]  He's got to do more live talk shows. Count Dankle is smart as it gets. We're going to come back to the final long segment and talk about whatever other issues he wants to get into and where he sees this all going. Count Dankle is our guest.
[1:42:54.920 --> 1:42:57.920]  I'm on shows.
[1:42:57.920 --> 1:43:14.920]  You know, it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it. It's just true that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti human program.
[1:43:14.920 --> 1:43:28.920]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done. So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at info wars.com.
[1:43:28.920 --> 1:43:39.920]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you. And so now we need to support more than ever because this fight has intensified. Don't need me to tell you that at info wars.com.
[1:43:39.920 --> 1:43:51.920]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now. Things have been sold out for a long time like info wars life, fizzy magnesium mix that's so amazing and our new immune support formula.
[1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:57.920]  They're so critical. They're all available 25 to 75% off and info wars store.com right now.
[1:43:57.920 --> 1:43:59.920]  Mike in California. Thanks for calling.
[1:43:59.920 --> 1:44:16.920]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research. Now if you read the actual 2014 legislation, the US government gain of function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influence of MERS and ZARS viruses.
[1:44:16.920 --> 1:44:28.920]  There's nothing about ZARS like viruses and it's a research funding pause. It's not a stop. It's not a prohibition. It's when you come to a four way intersection, there's the stops on you stop you look both ways and then you proceed.
[1:44:28.920 --> 1:44:40.920]  So it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function just selected gain of function, but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research though, you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right.
[1:44:40.920 --> 1:44:50.920]  They don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function. You know, that's why he didn't perjure himself. That's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do.
[1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:57.920]  But in the main definition, it's still a gain of function. You're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people. Thank you, Mike. We love you.
[1:44:57.920 --> 1:45:11.920]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between three individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other who are literally trying to create a post human world.
[1:45:11.920 --> 1:45:26.920]  For the United States of Brazil, of course, triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government. That's why they launched their great reset and their program after collapsing us of build back better.
[1:45:26.920 --> 1:45:39.920]  This is nothing more than a top down vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system couldn't win.
[1:45:39.920 --> 1:45:50.920]  They released a biological weapon on us. Now we know two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago. It's that simple. They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns.
[1:45:50.920 --> 1:45:57.920]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest of history. Expose this paradigm and we win.
[1:46:21.920 --> 1:46:32.920]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product. Concentrated elderberry, concentrated echinacea, concentrated astragalus root, angelica root, loatium root and more.
[1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:43.920]  This product is incredible. Info wars immune support exclusively available at infowarstore.com is funding the tip of the spear, the info wars operation. It is a 360 win.
[1:46:43.920 --> 1:46:50.920]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's natural defenses and keep info wars on the air.
[1:46:50.920 --> 1:47:16.920]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action. Take action now, infowarstore.com.
[1:47:16.920 --> 1:47:20.920]  I'm going to open the phones up and cover news. Take your calls.
[1:47:20.920 --> 1:47:27.920]  Here we are in the last 10 and a half minutes of hour number two with the man of the legend, Count Dankula.
[1:47:27.920 --> 1:47:33.920]  And I said, hey, I got a bunch of stuff I want to hit. Biden, what do you see happening with him? The economy, all this stuff.
[1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:35.920]  I said, what do you want to hit? He said, I want to hit Hunter Biden's laptop.
[1:47:35.920 --> 1:47:42.920]  And you know, that's something that's so incredibly thousands of images of sex, some of it underage, smoking crack.
[1:47:42.920 --> 1:47:48.920]  But forget that part. That's bad enough on board saying I'm under Chinese intelligence controlled.
[1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:53.920]  And the head of Chinese intelligence has been arrested and disappeared. And the FBI is after me.
[1:47:53.920 --> 1:47:59.920]  That's recordings two and a half years ago. They knew it. They suppressed it. Now it's out there.
[1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:03.920]  Where does this go? Because there's so many facets to this. Obviously the media is suppressing it.
[1:48:03.920 --> 1:48:08.920]  And then now it's out there. Why is it out there now? Where does Count Dankula see this going?
[1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:15.920]  I think it was a case of the laptop came out at an extremely bad time. It came out at the election.
[1:48:15.920 --> 1:48:20.920]  It came out at a time when the Democrats absolutely would not have wanted it out there.
[1:48:20.920 --> 1:48:26.920]  You know, the worst possible time. And so they had to pull every string that they could to get the story absolutely buried.
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:32.920]  And they says it's conspiracy theory was done by the Russians. It was all fake, you know, all these other different types of things right now.
[1:48:32.920 --> 1:48:41.920]  Basically, you know, a politician's son enjoying prostitutes and crack wasn't surprising to me, right?
[1:48:41.920 --> 1:48:45.920]  I didn't find that surprising. You know, that's just politicians doing politician things.
[1:48:45.920 --> 1:48:52.920]  It was the fact that no one was allowed to talk about it. People were banned from posting the images and posting the pictures.
[1:48:52.920 --> 1:49:00.920]  You know, it was getting suppressed absolutely everywhere. It was the New York Post ended up getting their account banned because they were posting information about it.
[1:49:00.920 --> 1:49:05.920]  And they were saying this isn't real. This isn't real. This is fake. You know, it was back like Hillary's emails.
[1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:11.920]  You know, I forget the guy's name who said on CNN, any information you get about these emails, you get you get it from us.
[1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:16.920]  You're not allowed to Chris Cuomo, Chris Cuomo and WikiLeaks. He said, we're allowed to look at WikiLeaks. You're not.
[1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:18.920]  You'll be arrested if you look at it.
[1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:26.920]  Yeah, exactly. So in other words, let us give you our interpretation of events like and that was what they wanted to do with the laptop as well.
[1:49:26.920 --> 1:49:36.920]  So that's why they got rid of it absolutely everywhere. Biden went on to win the election and it ended up like a wee while later.
[1:49:36.920 --> 1:49:44.920]  I think it was only just in the last few months that some like media outlets started to go, OK, OK, maybe the laptop story was real.
[1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:51.920]  And everybody was like, yeah, you're doing that after the election. Good one. Right. Now you're doing it and now you're allowed out there.
[1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:56.920]  But there's all types of things that are going to be allowed to get discussed now on Twitter, at least I hope.
[1:49:56.920 --> 1:50:04.920]  I'm not saying all this is all this for a fact is happening. This is the path that I hope Musk goes down where you are allowed to talk about the laptop.
[1:50:04.920 --> 1:50:09.920]  You are allowed to talk about vaccines. You are allowed to talk about certain Haram subjects.
[1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:13.920]  That's a great question because again, you're a really intuitive guy.
[1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:24.920]  If you were Elon Musk, like if you were king of the world, if you own Twitter, if you were with one hundred and eight million dollars, what would Count Danke would be doing if you were Elon Musk?
[1:50:24.920 --> 1:50:37.920]  If I was him, I would be removing all information algorithms so that I because he using little tricks and programs to influence how people are thinking without letting them choose it for themselves.
[1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:43.920]  I find that absolutely morally bankrupt. So I would remove those immediately.
[1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:50.920]  Ideas being discussed, I wouldn't care what ideas. If it was the discussion of certain ideas, then that's fine. I don't care what the idea is.
[1:50:50.920 --> 1:50:54.920]  If people want to discuss it, they can, even if I don't like the idea.
[1:50:54.920 --> 1:51:10.920]  The only things that I would do offer as an olive branch would be threats of violence that do indicate imminent lawless action, as it's called, and that's because based on Old Case in America, Brandenburg versus Ohio, where if a 12-year-old says,
[1:51:10.920 --> 1:51:26.920]  I'm going to kill you, someone on Xbox Live, well, he's not actually going to kill him. He was just angry. If a jealous, abusive, violent ex-boyfriend sends a message like that to his ex-girlfriend, well, then, yeah, maybe the cops should have a little knock on his door.
[1:51:26.920 --> 1:51:31.920]  So actionable threats of violence, that would be fine with them being taken off the box.
[1:51:31.920 --> 1:51:44.920]  Incredible actual ones that will result in the phrases, imminent lawless action. So those ones, fine. Child porn gone, obviously. That would definitely not be allowed on the platform.
[1:51:44.920 --> 1:51:55.920]  Outside of those, there's nothing I can really think of that I would want to censor. And also, I wouldn't want the power to censor. I don't think that's a power that should be in anyone's hands.
[1:51:55.920 --> 1:52:05.920]  And by the way, it looks like the first move he made, because I talked to Joe Rogan this morning, he's had 100,000 followers the last 24 hours on Twitter. All the conservatives, nationals, populists are exploding.
[1:52:05.920 --> 1:52:19.920]  All the liberals are imploding. We're finding out their bots. So it looks like Musk did immediately take some algorithm control system off. Here it is. Liberal Twitter users baffled as they lose thousands of followers after Musk buyout.
[1:52:19.920 --> 1:52:29.920]  I have a different theory, right? I don't have any evidence for this, but this is just something that floated around my mind. And it's just something, you know, do this what you will, right?
[1:52:29.920 --> 1:52:41.920]  Whenever Musk gave his first offer, they rejected it. They swallowed the poison pill, as it's called, to prevent him from taking over the company. And then they had about four or five days, and then they accepted the offer.
[1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:53.920]  And it was after that that they accepted the offer that we saw lots of, you know, left-wing accounts losing tons of followers, and we saw lots of right-wing accounts gaining lots of followers. I gained an awful lot of followers.
[1:52:53.920 --> 1:53:01.920]  Now, a theory that I have, Musk is barely in the door. He hasn't really done anything yet. You know, he's still signing paperwork. He hasn't even set foot in headquarters or anything.
[1:53:01.920 --> 1:53:12.920]  I think that Twitter maybe did a little bit of something that embassies do whenever they're doing a pull-out, where they'll eat certain things from the computer.
[1:53:12.920 --> 1:53:14.920]  Oh yeah, getting rid of their operatives.
[1:53:14.920 --> 1:53:23.920]  Well, getting rid of any algorithms that suppressed or ghostbanned certain accounts, you know, the thing that Twitter denied doing.
[1:53:23.920 --> 1:53:26.920]  I don't think you're wrong. I think that's what happened.
[1:53:26.920 --> 1:53:34.920]  Yeah. And so basically what I believe, because I looked in, because loads of people were saying, these are just people that are making new accounts, and that is why you're getting followed.
[1:53:34.920 --> 1:53:48.920]  But then I decided to go into my new followers, because you can see them in order as they follow you. And yes, there were some people who had just made a fresh new account, but there was also lots of accounts that had been on the platform for years.
[1:53:48.920 --> 1:53:52.920]  Yeah, they've been trying to follow you, but they were kept getting you. That's the minute that's happened.
[1:53:52.920 --> 1:54:01.920]  So in closing, in closing, where does all this go? What do you see unfolding?
[1:54:01.920 --> 1:54:07.920]  I think is a case where we are going to be allowed to be as popular as we are supposed to be in the free market.
[1:54:07.920 --> 1:54:13.920]  Basically, you know, people can't like you and follow your stuff and listen to your stuff if they have absolutely no idea you exist.
[1:54:13.920 --> 1:54:18.920]  So it was in, you know, the leftist's best interests to prevent people from hearing about you.
[1:54:18.920 --> 1:54:23.920]  You know, they learned a little bit too late that the Streisand effect was a very, very detrimental thing.
[1:54:23.920 --> 1:54:28.920]  You survived, I survived. So final question then. It's obviously one of the top trending things. When does Alex Jones come back?
[1:54:28.920 --> 1:54:34.920]  It's when does Trump come back? When does Alex Jones come back? They brought back people like Tucker Carlson and others.
[1:54:34.920 --> 1:54:40.920]  Like you said, it'll take him, I think, a few months. I got asked by a well-known talk show, how long till I'm back, and I'd love to come back.
[1:54:40.920 --> 1:54:48.920]  I think a few months till he even gets partial control, they admit they had to lock out the employees of Twitter from a bunch of controls so they wouldn't sabotage it.
[1:54:48.920 --> 1:54:56.920]  Yeah, they shut, they locked a lot of employees out of the tools because they were worried about, remember when there was an employee that left Twitter
[1:54:56.920 --> 1:55:00.920]  and his little final hurrah before he left the company, deleted Trump's account?
[1:55:00.920 --> 1:55:01.920]  Yes.
[1:55:01.920 --> 1:55:08.920]  You know, they were worried about people doing stuff like that. And I actually had thousands of people on Twitter that wanted me to ask you.
[1:55:08.920 --> 1:55:14.920]  If Elon Musk says Alex Jones is allowed back on Twitter, will you make an account?
[1:55:14.920 --> 1:55:19.920]  Of course I'll make an account. I think Trump's wrong to say, oh, I'm on Truth Social, I won't come back to Twitter.
[1:55:19.920 --> 1:55:26.920]  He's even post on Truth Social. So he should go back to Twitter and promote whatever he's doing. It's a really dumb move if Trump doesn't do it.
[1:55:26.920 --> 1:55:33.920]  Yeah, yeah. He definitely should come back to Twitter because like Musk said, it is the online marketplace.
[1:55:33.920 --> 1:55:41.920]  You know, yeah, okay, there are alternatives out there. There are other marketplaces. Unfortunately, a lot of them are located in little dusty alleyways.
[1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:49.920]  They only have a few people in them. You know, Twitter is the big one. It's the big main one where everybody comes, which is why I feel it's quite crucial
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:54.920]  for a platform with that much power to enforce freedom of speech so that ideas are being exchanged fairly.
[1:55:54.920 --> 1:56:01.920]  And so I believe that Trump should come back. I want Carpy Donkton to come back. I want Sargon of Akkad to come back.
[1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:09.920]  I know that Tommy Robinson tried to make an account yesterday and he announced his return, but then he was very quickly banned.
[1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:11.920]  I don't know if Tommy Robinson will be allowed to go back.
[1:56:11.920 --> 1:56:16.920]  We've got to give Musk a while to get in there and get control. All right, Count Dankula, incredible interview.
[1:56:16.920 --> 1:56:21.920]  Everybody finds you at Count Dankula TV on Twitter and YouTube. Count Dankula, you got to come back more than every two years.
[1:56:21.920 --> 1:56:25.920]  We salute you. We really appreciate you. You're an amazing person.
[1:56:25.920 --> 1:56:28.920]  Thanks very much, man. I appreciate it. It's good to be back.
[1:56:28.920 --> 1:56:31.920]  Good to be back, brother. All right. What a crazy time to be alive.
[1:56:31.920 --> 1:56:39.920]  Next hour, I'm giving the number out. We're taking your calls, 877-878-92539, long-time callers, first-time callers, people that disagree agree.
[1:56:39.920 --> 1:56:43.920]  All we want is a clear telephone and a point you want to make. We're not censoring you.
[1:56:43.920 --> 1:56:50.920]  If you disagree, please call in. Push the head of the line. 877-778-92539, 877-778-92539.
[1:56:50.920 --> 1:56:53.920]  And we've been getting a lot of crypto donations, which is keeping us on air.
[1:56:53.920 --> 1:57:01.920]  I want to salute all those who you are that have been giving the donations. Please go to infowars.com forward slash crypto.
[1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:08.920]  infowars.com forward slash crypto, infowars.com forward slash crypto.
[1:57:08.920 --> 1:57:16.920]  Whether it's a dollar in Ethereum or Bitcoin or whatever it is, whether it's $1,000 or $1,000,000, we will use it to fight the new world order.
[1:57:16.920 --> 1:57:23.920]  Ethereum, Bitcoin, XRP, Litecoin, there's dozens of them there, infowarsstore.com.
[1:57:23.920 --> 1:57:29.920]  And by the way, we've got our own NFTs at Arnescam. They're totally badass and total victory coming out next week.
[1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:34.920]  I'll tell you about that later. But right now, infowars.com forward slash crypto.
[1:57:34.920 --> 1:57:38.920]  The real revolution is happening now. Infowars.com forward slash crypto.
[1:57:38.920 --> 1:57:47.920]  And all of you that donated, we salute you and thank you. Hour number three straight ahead.
[1:57:47.920 --> 1:57:59.920]  Over the years, infowars has produced more than 200 amazing patriot Americana Second Amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts, ball caps, flags.
[1:57:59.920 --> 1:58:04.920]  You name it. All of the apparel and the flags are being sold at cost right now.
[1:58:04.920 --> 1:58:12.920]  That's just regular plain chain shirts. That is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[1:58:12.920 --> 1:58:17.920]  We used to sell for $40. We're selling them for $15, selling them for $20, whatever the shirt costs.
[1:58:17.920 --> 1:58:21.920]  If a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5 for essentially produce.
[1:58:21.920 --> 1:58:27.920]  It costs $10 or selling it for $10. And we've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves and we've got short sleeves.
[1:58:27.920 --> 1:58:34.920]  We've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all and they're limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs.
[1:58:34.920 --> 1:58:39.920]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[1:58:39.920 --> 1:58:47.920]  We've got to sell this to keep InfoWars on the air plus it spreads the word infowars.com to your historic apparel now infowars.com.
[1:58:47.920 --> 1:58:57.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarsstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[1:58:57.920 --> 1:59:03.920]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains have broken down,
[1:59:03.920 --> 1:59:08.920]  and InfoWars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for operations.
[1:59:08.920 --> 1:59:13.920]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their main move.
[1:59:13.920 --> 1:59:19.920]  InfoWars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[1:59:19.920 --> 1:59:27.920]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure, pay for our own bandwidth, everything else, we are running out of money.
[1:59:27.920 --> 1:59:36.920]  So listen, up to 75% off at infowarsstore.com on things like amazing Patriot t-shirts that help spread the word and fund the operation.
[1:59:36.920 --> 1:59:45.920]  On supplements, on books, on films, everything is 25 to 75% off right now, the biggest sell in our history at infowarsstore.com.
[1:59:45.920 --> 1:59:48.920]  Thank you for your support.
[1:59:48.920 --> 1:59:58.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:59:58.920 --> 2:00:09.920]  On the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like, at least in government, but there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[2:00:09.920 --> 2:00:19.920]  The left have wised up to this. If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it, the social media giants, and they are.
[2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:25.920]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[2:00:25.920 --> 2:00:30.920]  So far, the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[2:00:30.920 --> 2:00:38.920]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations in Big Tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[2:00:38.920 --> 2:00:44.920]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[2:00:44.920 --> 2:00:51.920]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[2:00:51.920 --> 2:01:01.920]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press, working with Big Tech.
[2:01:01.920 --> 2:01:04.920]  People know what's true. They can smell it.
[2:01:04.920 --> 2:01:09.920]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[2:01:09.920 --> 2:01:16.920]  In a free country, everyone can be heard. In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be heard.
[2:01:16.920 --> 2:01:23.920]  Look at this right here. It's a guy that goes around policing and calling for censorship and then claims that Trump's wrong.
[2:01:23.920 --> 2:01:28.920]  There's no censorship of conservatives or patriots. You are incredibly shameful.
[2:01:28.920 --> 2:01:29.920]  How are you doing, Alex?
[2:01:29.920 --> 2:01:30.920]  Eyes of the rat.
[2:01:33.920 --> 2:01:34.920]  Eyes of the rat.
[2:01:37.920 --> 2:01:38.920]  Eyes of the rat.
[2:01:38.920 --> 2:01:45.920]  Eyes of the rat. Even more evil looking person. He is just scum. You're a virus to America and freedom.
[2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:49.920]  Smelling like a possum that climbed out of the rear of a dead cow.
[2:01:50.920 --> 2:01:53.920]  You look like a possum that got caught doing some really, really nasty stuff.
[2:01:54.920 --> 2:02:00.920]  Eyes of the rat. Even more evil looking person. He is just scum. You're a virus to America and freedom.
[2:02:00.920 --> 2:02:03.920]  Smelling like a possum that climbed out of the rear and of a dead cow.
[2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:04.920]  Wow.
[2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:11.120]  You look like a possum that got caught doing some really really nasty stuff.
[2:02:11.120 --> 2:02:14.800]  Caught doing some really really nasty stuff.
[2:02:14.800 --> 2:02:18.480]  Caught doing some really really nasty stuff.
[2:02:18.480 --> 2:02:22.600]  Caught doing some really really nasty stuff.
[2:02:22.600 --> 2:02:23.600]  That's enough?
[2:02:23.600 --> 2:02:24.600]  Really?
[2:02:24.600 --> 2:02:25.600]  That's hilarious.
[2:02:25.600 --> 2:02:32.440]  All you people that have an inferiority complex and think if you can take the greatness
[2:02:32.440 --> 2:02:36.520]  of America and dominate it that you might actually be somebody because you project your own loathing
[2:02:36.520 --> 2:02:38.640]  for yourself on everybody else.
[2:02:38.640 --> 2:02:39.640]  I'm a winner.
[2:02:39.640 --> 2:02:40.640]  I love myself.
[2:02:40.640 --> 2:02:41.640]  I love who I come from.
[2:02:41.640 --> 2:02:42.640]  Victory and strength and honor.
[2:02:42.640 --> 2:02:44.640]  You are the definition of dishonor.
[2:02:44.640 --> 2:02:49.760]  And one day in the encyclopedia Britannica, encyclopedia Galactica, it will have your
[2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:52.080]  face next to dishonor and the word wrath.
[2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:54.080]  What do you hope to accomplish here?
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:58.280]  I'm just showing people just the certile nature of the bottom of the barrel of those dying
[2:02:58.280 --> 2:03:02.600]  news corporations that you have to dredge up from the front lines to attack the First
[2:03:02.600 --> 2:03:03.600]  Amendment.
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:04.600]  You're going to be equivalent of like that.
[2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:09.240]  You're equivalent of like the Hitler youth being put on the front line to stop the advance
[2:03:09.240 --> 2:03:10.240]  of the allies.
[2:03:10.240 --> 2:03:11.240]  So you came here to attack the media?
[2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:12.240]  You're not the media.
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:13.240]  You are fake news.
[2:03:13.240 --> 2:03:14.240]  You are the criminal news network.
[2:03:14.240 --> 2:03:19.240]  You engage in racketeering trying to shut down real news or information.
[2:03:19.240 --> 2:03:26.680]  You engage in lying fraud in your audience on a premeditated continual basis.
[2:03:26.680 --> 2:03:33.680]  You got some damn evil eyes, son.
[2:03:33.680 --> 2:03:40.840]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[2:03:40.840 --> 2:03:42.680]  and chemicals added to the food.
[2:03:42.680 --> 2:03:43.680]  It's all come out.
[2:03:43.680 --> 2:03:47.920]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God,
[2:03:47.920 --> 2:03:50.920]  the Creator, and we are powerful.
[2:03:50.920 --> 2:03:54.160]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[2:03:54.160 --> 2:03:58.000]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:01.800]  with the boy, is it true?
[2:04:01.800 --> 2:04:07.640]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[2:04:07.640 --> 2:04:11.440]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:18.120]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God
[2:04:18.120 --> 2:04:20.120]  of this world who is a loser.
[2:04:20.120 --> 2:04:23.560]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep them full wars in the air now more than
[2:04:23.560 --> 2:04:24.560]  ever.
[2:04:24.560 --> 2:04:28.200]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting
[2:04:28.200 --> 2:04:29.200]  up is satanic.
[2:04:29.200 --> 2:04:48.200]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast thing.
[2:04:48.200 --> 2:05:02.960]  It's about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand info wars.
[2:05:02.960 --> 2:05:07.000]  I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple
[2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:08.000]  little local radio show.
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:11.920]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge
[2:05:11.920 --> 2:05:12.920]  the globalist.
[2:05:12.920 --> 2:05:14.360]  And it was a t-shirt I designed.
[2:05:14.360 --> 2:05:19.960]  And the first one, mass murderers agree gun control works that helped us finance hiring
[2:05:19.960 --> 2:05:21.880]  the first three members of my crew.
[2:05:21.880 --> 2:05:23.760]  That's our oldest design and we still sell it.
[2:05:23.760 --> 2:05:29.040]  We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions because whatever
[2:05:29.040 --> 2:05:34.080]  stock we've got in, that's it, we're selling everything out to find the operation to get
[2:05:34.080 --> 2:05:35.080]  rid of inventory.
[2:05:35.080 --> 2:05:38.760]  We'll still have some teachers in the future, they'll just be limited editions and short
[2:05:38.760 --> 2:05:39.760]  runs.
[2:05:39.760 --> 2:05:42.760]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[2:05:42.760 --> 2:05:43.760]  I almost forgot.
[2:05:43.760 --> 2:05:48.000]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:53.640]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts,
[2:05:53.640 --> 2:06:04.600]  designer shirts, they're all selling at cost infowarstore.com.
[2:06:04.600 --> 2:06:33.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Wednesday, April 27th Worldwide Transmission.
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:35.880]  I'm your host Alex Jones, I want to thank the great crew for all the wonderful work
[2:06:35.880 --> 2:06:36.880]  they do.
[2:06:36.880 --> 2:06:40.280]  Amazing interview with Count Dankula in the last hour.
[2:06:40.280 --> 2:06:45.720]  All right, I got a bunch of news to cover and I've got a lot to break down.
[2:06:45.720 --> 2:06:50.560]  There have been a bunch of viral videos that have been put out about myself and unbanning
[2:06:50.560 --> 2:06:56.640]  us on Twitter and those people have said, why isn't Alex Jones calling us out?
[2:06:56.640 --> 2:07:02.360]  Why isn't Alex Jones appreciating what we've done and I'm going to tell those viewers and
[2:07:02.360 --> 2:07:06.240]  those listeners why I haven't done that.
[2:07:06.240 --> 2:07:13.160]  Every time I praise some activist on Google or on Twitter or on Apple or on Facebook or
[2:07:13.160 --> 2:07:15.360]  on Instagram, they get banned.
[2:07:15.360 --> 2:07:17.400]  So that's the reason I haven't done it.
[2:07:17.400 --> 2:07:21.640]  But since you asked for it, maybe now it's different with Elon Musk, I've got it here
[2:07:21.640 --> 2:07:26.840]  in the stack, I will give you credit and we'll play the piece here in a moment.
[2:07:26.840 --> 2:07:33.520]  It's got a few bleeps in it, but this is Damon Imani or Imani Well, I can't my eyes are
[2:07:33.520 --> 2:07:34.520]  going on.
[2:07:34.520 --> 2:07:37.400]  I got glasses last year, but I haven't been wearing it.
[2:07:37.400 --> 2:07:43.240]  And he is at Damon, I am a and I a great guy.
[2:07:43.240 --> 2:07:44.240]  Amazing talent.
[2:07:44.240 --> 2:07:47.160]  He did that whole thing where Alex Jones takes over the Davos group piece that got tens
[2:07:47.160 --> 2:07:48.160]  of millions of views.
[2:07:48.160 --> 2:07:49.160]  He's on this new one.
[2:07:49.160 --> 2:07:54.120]  Elon Musk and Twitter employees reinstated Alex Jones account live on Joe Rogan's podcast.
[2:07:54.120 --> 2:07:58.400]  They edit myself and others in the same studio back when it was California and show that.
[2:07:58.400 --> 2:08:05.200]  So they're my friend, Damon, I'm fully aware of your work, Damon, Amani.
[2:08:05.200 --> 2:08:06.600]  And this is better print.
[2:08:06.600 --> 2:08:07.600]  I can read it here.
[2:08:07.600 --> 2:08:10.520]  So David Amani, we salute you and we appreciate you.
[2:08:10.520 --> 2:08:14.280]  Someone tell Alex Jones that I've done two viral parodies and more than that on him in
[2:08:14.280 --> 2:08:17.000]  a month and I still haven't received the shout out.
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:18.600]  Well, you're getting the shout out.
[2:08:18.600 --> 2:08:19.600]  Okay.
[2:08:19.600 --> 2:08:24.080]  So I hope they don't ban you because I did the shout out does not mean I don't want
[2:08:24.080 --> 2:08:25.080]  to appreciate you.
[2:08:25.080 --> 2:08:29.960]  In fact, about a month ago, there's a particular individual I won't even say who is getting
[2:08:29.960 --> 2:08:35.240]  millions of views a day, millions, millions and millions of people exposing COVID and
[2:08:35.240 --> 2:08:36.640]  putting a lot of our stuff out.
[2:08:36.640 --> 2:08:39.280]  I wouldn't dare say who they are.
[2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:42.840]  And then finally, I did and they banned them, but they came back got stronger.
[2:08:42.840 --> 2:08:45.480]  So that's why I haven't been talking about you, brother.
[2:08:45.480 --> 2:08:47.400]  I really, really appreciate you.
[2:08:47.400 --> 2:08:49.280]  Here's the latest little piece he put out.
[2:08:49.280 --> 2:08:51.440]  Are you ready for us?
[2:08:51.440 --> 2:08:52.440]  Sure.
[2:08:52.440 --> 2:08:53.440]  Fine.
[2:08:53.440 --> 2:08:54.440]  Okay.
[2:08:54.440 --> 2:08:55.440]  Perfect.
[2:08:55.440 --> 2:09:00.440]  They're killing already more kids, so you're telling me it isn't real or they had a f***ing
[2:09:00.440 --> 2:09:09.920]  vote and then f***ing said it.
[2:09:09.920 --> 2:09:11.680]  That's all over the internet right now.
[2:09:11.680 --> 2:09:12.680]  It's having a lot of fun.
[2:09:12.680 --> 2:09:14.160]  So there, I really appreciate you.
[2:09:14.160 --> 2:09:15.800]  I hope you don't get banned now.
[2:09:15.800 --> 2:09:16.800]  All right.
[2:09:16.800 --> 2:09:17.800]  Let's do this.
[2:09:17.800 --> 2:09:18.800]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[2:09:18.800 --> 2:09:21.520]  That's what the news were beginning as well as breaking.
[2:09:21.520 --> 2:09:22.520]  We got Russell.
[2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:23.520]  We got Justin.
[2:09:23.520 --> 2:09:24.520]  We got Forrest.
[2:09:24.520 --> 2:09:25.520]  That was my uncle's name.
[2:09:25.520 --> 2:09:26.520]  We got Austin.
[2:09:26.520 --> 2:09:28.080]  We got Nathan.
[2:09:28.080 --> 2:09:29.080]  We got Dustin.
[2:09:29.080 --> 2:09:30.080]  We got Bellow.
[2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:31.080]  We got David.
[2:09:31.080 --> 2:09:32.080]  We got Chris.
[2:09:32.080 --> 2:09:33.080]  We got Kentucky Rebel and Matthew.
[2:09:33.080 --> 2:09:38.080]  And I will go to all of your calls, the order that they have been received.
[2:09:38.080 --> 2:09:41.720]  And so first up, ladies and gentlemen, is a caller from Oregon, Russell.
[2:09:41.720 --> 2:09:42.720]  You're on the air.
[2:09:42.720 --> 2:09:43.720]  Welcome.
[2:09:43.720 --> 2:09:44.720]  Alex, good morning.
[2:09:44.720 --> 2:09:51.160]  I just wanted to let you know, man, I love you so much and thanks for making these great
[2:09:51.160 --> 2:09:52.520]  products.
[2:09:52.520 --> 2:09:55.720]  X3 iodine is just phenomenal.
[2:09:55.720 --> 2:09:57.840]  Every listener should be buying this.
[2:09:57.840 --> 2:09:59.320]  It's powerful, brother.
[2:09:59.320 --> 2:10:00.320]  We love you.
[2:10:00.320 --> 2:10:01.320]  X3 sold out.
[2:10:01.320 --> 2:10:02.320]  We have X2.
[2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:03.320]  It's just as good.
[2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:08.760]  Well, I just wanted to give you a report, a frontline report from here in Portland,
[2:10:08.760 --> 2:10:09.760]  Oregon.
[2:10:09.760 --> 2:10:12.680]  This is the beta test for the New World Order.
[2:10:12.680 --> 2:10:14.840]  This is where it's all happening.
[2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:26.000]  We are being manipulated in this town to basically be the forerunner of what every other community
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:30.400]  is going to be experiencing in this town and the rest of the Western world.
[2:10:30.400 --> 2:10:35.040]  And this is a small, out-of-the-way place on the Western frontier.
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:39.520]  Oh, man, when I've read, Western Canada is running incredible police states under COVID
[2:10:39.520 --> 2:10:40.520]  journey.
[2:10:40.520 --> 2:10:41.520]  Tell us about that.
[2:10:41.520 --> 2:10:45.800]  Well, I want to tell you about what's going on here in Portland and specifically that
[2:10:45.800 --> 2:10:53.080]  we have what I am calling a weaponized homeless camp, that the city has the kid behind us.
[2:10:53.080 --> 2:10:54.080]  Sorry, Mr. Herger.
[2:10:54.080 --> 2:10:55.920]  You said West Coast and Canada.
[2:10:55.920 --> 2:10:56.920]  I must have missed that.
[2:10:56.920 --> 2:11:01.680]  But yeah, a Portland, he knows a giant communist command base, social engineering laboratory,
[2:11:01.680 --> 2:11:03.240]  which tells us what they want to do to us next.
[2:11:03.240 --> 2:11:05.960]  So please give us an intel report.
[2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:11.840]  So what we're experiencing most acutely right now is weaponized homeless camp.
[2:11:11.840 --> 2:11:19.280]  This is something that the city and this is colluding with the CDC, the CDC guidelines,
[2:11:19.280 --> 2:11:26.000]  going back to 2020 said no homeless camps should be dispersed or moved because it's
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:28.680]  a threat to, you know, spreading COVID.
[2:11:28.680 --> 2:11:35.800]  Although we have found that legitimately there is way less transmission of COVID from homeless
[2:11:35.800 --> 2:11:38.360]  camps because they're outdoors.
[2:11:38.360 --> 2:11:44.360]  That being said, we have camps, I mean, I've heard me talk about San Francisco on the show,
[2:11:44.360 --> 2:11:49.520]  but Portland, you know, being a much smaller community, we have a problem that is magnified
[2:11:49.520 --> 2:11:50.520]  beyond.
[2:11:50.520 --> 2:11:51.520]  No, they are.
[2:11:51.520 --> 2:11:52.520]  They are spectacular camps.
[2:11:52.520 --> 2:11:53.520]  I've been there.
[2:11:53.520 --> 2:11:54.520]  I've been to Seattle.
[2:11:54.520 --> 2:11:55.520]  I've been to Portland.
[2:11:55.520 --> 2:11:59.320]  I've been, I live here in Austin, and it's just night and day from five years ago.
[2:11:59.320 --> 2:12:00.320]  What caused this?
[2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:01.320]  You're right.
[2:12:01.320 --> 2:12:05.760]  Once they have this collapse emergency, they use that to declare an official emergency
[2:12:05.760 --> 2:12:07.360]  for FEMA CDC control.
[2:12:07.360 --> 2:12:09.560]  Well, that's right.
[2:12:09.560 --> 2:12:16.360]  And the other thing that's driving it is we passed Measure 110 here in Oregon in 2020,
[2:12:16.360 --> 2:12:20.440]  November 2020 as a ballot measure that criminalized all drugs.
[2:12:20.440 --> 2:12:25.440]  And I'm sure you're familiar with this, but now it's legal to have, you know, multiple
[2:12:25.440 --> 2:12:31.400]  grams of meth, heroin, fentanyl, crack cocaine, all, you know, it's not just one or the other
[2:12:31.400 --> 2:12:32.400]  or the other.
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:37.520]  Most people can have all of them, and it's not just the users, but it's the drug dealers
[2:12:37.520 --> 2:12:38.520]  that are coming in.
[2:12:38.520 --> 2:12:44.240]  Sir, three years ago, I was with Katie Hopkins at Skid Row that goes on for 10 miles in old
[2:12:44.240 --> 2:12:45.480]  directions.
[2:12:45.480 --> 2:12:49.880]  And we were with opportunity police officers with guns, and there were dudes in escalades
[2:12:49.880 --> 2:12:53.720]  flipping us off, following us, threatening us because they don't bust any of them.
[2:12:53.720 --> 2:12:54.720]  They don't stop any of them.
[2:12:54.720 --> 2:12:56.680]  They're allowed to sit there and sell the drugs.
[2:12:56.680 --> 2:13:01.280]  And the welfare checks all go to the people, and they're black, white, Hispanic, old, young,
[2:13:01.280 --> 2:13:06.280]  and they just lay out on drugs all day doing the fentanyl crawl, and you just see the targeting
[2:13:06.280 --> 2:13:07.280]  of the American people.
[2:13:07.280 --> 2:13:08.280]  It's insane.
[2:13:08.280 --> 2:13:12.360]  Well, I've got, I've got one more point about it, Alex, and I think that this is the big
[2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:18.040]  take home that nobody has mentioned that in not in my community and not in the national,
[2:13:18.040 --> 2:13:24.720]  you know, scheme, how about the fact that we require sex offenders to register when they
[2:13:24.720 --> 2:13:29.760]  move into an area and to inform the city and form the county and form the state and form
[2:13:29.760 --> 2:13:30.760]  their neighbors?
[2:13:30.760 --> 2:13:34.120]  What do people not do when they're living in a homeless camp?
[2:13:34.120 --> 2:13:36.120]  They do not register as sex offenders.
[2:13:36.120 --> 2:13:41.760]  There's no accountability, and you're important when you have these weaponized homeless camps
[2:13:41.760 --> 2:13:46.280]  just nesting across from, across the street from schools, across the street from playgrounds
[2:13:46.280 --> 2:13:52.480]  and parks, and we have bars here that prevent you from opening a leak store or a liquor
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:57.200]  store a thousand feet from a school, but across the street from a school.
[2:13:57.200 --> 2:14:01.800]  There's massive regulations on trying to open a business or a church or anything, but then
[2:14:01.800 --> 2:14:06.520]  everybody's drugged out of their minds next to a school with burning fires at night and
[2:14:06.520 --> 2:14:09.440]  raping murder, and it's all okay.
[2:14:09.440 --> 2:14:14.720]  And it's an open air drug camp, and if, and they are literally shooting and selling drugs
[2:14:14.720 --> 2:14:18.120]  across the street from, so this is six blocks from my home.
[2:14:18.120 --> 2:14:24.800]  I take taxes here in Portland, Oregon, and they want anything to, to, to accommodate
[2:14:24.800 --> 2:14:26.200]  actual citizens.
[2:14:26.200 --> 2:14:27.800]  This is, everything is being done.
[2:14:27.800 --> 2:14:33.160]  If you threw trash and needles on your yard as a citizen, you would get cited, you would
[2:14:33.160 --> 2:14:38.240]  get fined by the city, but if you do it in an open air drug market on the street, it's
[2:14:38.240 --> 2:14:39.760]  fine, and nobody cares.
[2:14:39.760 --> 2:14:45.120]  You can make as much mess, you can touch kids, can, you know, coerce kids into using fentanyl.
[2:14:45.120 --> 2:14:48.240]  Oh yeah, you see underage girls and people there.
[2:14:48.240 --> 2:14:52.160]  This is all over the place, and this is the modern euthanasia camp.
[2:14:52.160 --> 2:14:57.840]  They put weaponized MIT CIA developed drugs like fentanyl, way worse than even cracking
[2:14:57.840 --> 2:14:59.400]  the 80s they shipped in.
[2:14:59.400 --> 2:15:03.200]  They put it there, and they let it be a death zone like Mazda Flame.
[2:15:03.200 --> 2:15:05.040]  It's the take down of the country.
[2:15:05.040 --> 2:15:06.720]  God bless you, Russell.
[2:15:06.720 --> 2:15:09.120]  All right, I got to one call in that segment.
[2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:10.120]  I got to get to everybody now.
[2:15:10.120 --> 2:15:13.640]  So we're going to come back in the next 45 minutes, we're going to get to everybody here.
[2:15:13.640 --> 2:15:18.800]  Up next is going to be Justin, and then Forrest, and then right down the line, we're going
[2:15:18.800 --> 2:15:21.860]  to take your calls, the order they were received.
[2:15:21.860 --> 2:15:27.640]  But yeah, this is it, and they're lacing marijuana with fentanyl, and they're lacing all sorts
[2:15:27.640 --> 2:15:28.640]  of stuff.
[2:15:28.640 --> 2:15:30.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's so dangerous.
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:36.800]  You don't need me to tell you this, but this is the chemical attack on America, and fentanyl
[2:15:36.800 --> 2:15:41.460]  shipments and drug overdoses have tripled, both have tripled, obviously it's triple
[2:15:41.460 --> 2:15:45.560]  amount, triple overdose, since Biden got in, Trump did a damn good job of cutting fentanyl
[2:15:45.560 --> 2:15:50.320]  back 90%, now it has exploded, and again, that is mass murder.
[2:15:50.320 --> 2:15:53.680]  Since Biden running that, no, he's a puppet, but the people running the Biden administration
[2:15:53.680 --> 2:15:58.240]  are guilty of war crimes, of chemical attack.
[2:15:58.240 --> 2:16:00.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:03.440]  I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong.
[2:16:03.440 --> 2:16:07.440]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[2:16:07.440 --> 2:16:08.640]  I was born for this.
[2:16:08.640 --> 2:16:13.120]  You were born for this, and people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our
[2:16:13.120 --> 2:16:18.120]  own infrastructure because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions
[2:16:18.120 --> 2:16:19.120]  of dollars.
[2:16:19.120 --> 2:16:24.760]  With Band-Aid video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform for thousands
[2:16:24.760 --> 2:16:30.320]  of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge,
[2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:35.200]  and because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22.
[2:16:35.200 --> 2:16:39.720]  Info wars and Band-Aid video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[2:16:39.720 --> 2:16:46.040]  movement worldwide, but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds
[2:16:46.040 --> 2:16:47.800]  and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:52.120]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout
[2:16:52.120 --> 2:16:57.680]  sale up to 75% off, getting incredible products and keeping info wars as strong as ever.
[2:16:57.680 --> 2:17:03.000]  The first 10 amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791.
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:07.920]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press.
[2:17:07.920 --> 2:17:14.160]  Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference
[2:17:14.160 --> 2:17:16.760]  and restraint by the government.
[2:17:16.760 --> 2:17:21.560]  Two hundred and thirty one years later, free speech across America is under chronic and
[2:17:21.560 --> 2:17:25.840]  insidious attack GCN is under attack.
[2:17:25.840 --> 2:17:30.480]  Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not want you to know the truth.
[2:17:30.480 --> 2:17:36.640]  I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up and help us defend our right to
[2:17:36.640 --> 2:17:38.840]  continue telling you the truth.
[2:17:38.840 --> 2:17:40.320]  Would you like to join us?

[2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:01.400]  in info wars.com.

[2:19:59.080 --> 2:20:17.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:17.720 --> 2:20:21.960]  We're living in a magical time.
[2:20:21.960 --> 2:20:28.760]  There's not just evil in the universe, there's good, but the main enemy is apathy.
[2:20:28.760 --> 2:20:30.720]  Don't be apathetic.
[2:20:30.720 --> 2:20:31.720]  Don't be a spectator.
[2:20:31.720 --> 2:20:37.280]  Don't live your precious 75 years on average on this planet and not be in the game.
[2:20:37.280 --> 2:20:41.640]  Info wars is all about being in the game because remember, God's watching.
[2:20:41.640 --> 2:20:46.520]  All right, Justin in Minnesota, you're on the year worldwide.
[2:20:46.520 --> 2:20:52.640]  Mr. Jones, this is my first time talking to you and this is an absolute honor.
[2:20:52.640 --> 2:20:57.480]  And I'm just going to give you the floor right now.
[2:20:57.480 --> 2:21:05.080]  I went to the male clinic here in roster Minnesota and I held up a sign that said stop the great
[2:21:05.080 --> 2:21:12.920]  reset because I don't believe in the fear that has been pushed in this blue state.
[2:21:12.920 --> 2:21:21.440]  So my question, Mr. Jones, because I got some pop thrown on my sign and me and they're
[2:21:21.440 --> 2:21:25.080]  saying, you know, things like, Oh, my son's in there.
[2:21:25.080 --> 2:21:26.600]  I have kids in there.
[2:21:26.600 --> 2:21:30.600]  You know, we're scared of this phony pandemic and whatnot.
[2:21:30.600 --> 2:21:39.040]  How do we convince the rest of the population in these blue states like mine that this is
[2:21:39.040 --> 2:21:41.760]  just a fear tactic?
[2:21:41.760 --> 2:21:44.000]  Minnesota, I hope you're listening to Mr. Jones right now.
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  Go ahead.
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:48.320]  Well, look, most people want to believe the social contract hadn't been broken.
[2:21:48.320 --> 2:21:50.960]  They want to believe the corporation government are on their side and there's a lot of good
[2:21:50.960 --> 2:21:55.320]  people in corporations and in government, but at the top, very, very bad people are
[2:21:55.320 --> 2:21:56.840]  in control.
[2:21:56.840 --> 2:22:01.440]  And so to expose the fact that the great reset wants to shut down society and bankrupt us
[2:22:01.440 --> 2:22:04.360]  and now we're in the great reset is a good thing.
[2:22:04.360 --> 2:22:07.320]  You're not against all the doctors in the building, you're not against all the nurses.
[2:22:07.320 --> 2:22:11.520]  You're against the policies and the fear mongering and the blocking of treatments and a vaccine
[2:22:11.520 --> 2:22:13.400]  that isn't a vaccine that doesn't protect you.
[2:22:13.400 --> 2:22:18.560]  So I would just describe it that way to people.
[2:22:18.560 --> 2:22:22.880]  Mr. Jones, I really appreciate you taking my, my, my call on Justin, I appreciate you
[2:22:22.880 --> 2:22:23.880]  calling in brother.
[2:22:23.880 --> 2:22:26.680]  What else is on your mind?
[2:22:26.680 --> 2:22:34.520]  How do I, brother, I don't know how to make people can believe the truth because we're
[2:22:34.520 --> 2:22:39.560]  telling the truth and it's like, well, listen, you're never going to get the general sheeple
[2:22:39.560 --> 2:22:40.560]  public.
[2:22:40.560 --> 2:22:44.600]  It's a minority that always does evil and it's a minority that always does good.
[2:22:44.600 --> 2:22:47.600]  And for the media spends, I don't mean a minority of people's color.
[2:22:47.600 --> 2:22:49.800]  I mean a minority of a group.
[2:22:49.800 --> 2:22:53.080]  And so that's what we're doing, my friend and Justin, I appreciate your call.
[2:22:53.080 --> 2:22:54.240]  I appreciate it.
[2:22:54.240 --> 2:22:55.240]  Let's go to very good questions.
[2:22:55.240 --> 2:22:58.080]  Let's go to forest in Nebraska, for us here on the air.
[2:22:58.080 --> 2:23:03.800]  How you doing, Alex, man, I'm above ground talking to you and we're, we're, we're in
[2:23:03.800 --> 2:23:04.800]  the new older now.
[2:23:04.800 --> 2:23:05.800]  So I'm doing all right.
[2:23:05.800 --> 2:23:06.800]  Yeah.
[2:23:06.800 --> 2:23:07.800]  We're above ground for now.
[2:23:07.800 --> 2:23:08.800]  Yeah.
[2:23:08.800 --> 2:23:12.480]  I was actually the pipeline inspector that called in about the colonial a while back.
[2:23:12.480 --> 2:23:13.480]  I remember.
[2:23:13.480 --> 2:23:14.480]  Yeah.
[2:23:14.480 --> 2:23:17.160]  Now they're saying cyber attacks and, and they're shutting off our pipelines.
[2:23:17.160 --> 2:23:19.200]  It's so obvious who's against us.
[2:23:19.200 --> 2:23:22.960]  Well, I got some news there too.
[2:23:22.960 --> 2:23:26.400]  You know, I talked about how they could manually operate that pipeline and then it come out
[2:23:26.400 --> 2:23:29.680]  that they did somewhat manually operate, operate that pipeline.
[2:23:29.680 --> 2:23:32.120]  Well, you know, they've got the keystone shut down.
[2:23:32.120 --> 2:23:34.840]  The first thing Biden did and they've done all these other projects shut down.
[2:23:34.840 --> 2:23:40.560]  They're not issuing any more permits, but magically they're working on the, on the colonial
[2:23:40.560 --> 2:23:41.560]  now.
[2:23:41.560 --> 2:23:43.880]  They've got some money from somewhere and got the permission to do things.
[2:23:43.880 --> 2:23:49.360]  So I'm thinking that whole thing was just a giant con job.
[2:23:49.360 --> 2:23:53.560]  Well groups definitely stage attacks on themselves to get money in power.
[2:23:53.560 --> 2:23:56.240]  The Romans would always say when some attack happened, who benefits?
[2:23:56.240 --> 2:23:58.800]  Because half the time they found it was their own people doing it.
[2:23:58.800 --> 2:23:59.800]  And it's just the facts.
[2:23:59.800 --> 2:24:02.640]  It's like, it's why when the Pentagon said the Russians are going to stage a false flag,
[2:24:02.640 --> 2:24:03.640]  they're about to invade.
[2:24:03.640 --> 2:24:04.640]  They had intel.
[2:24:04.640 --> 2:24:05.640]  It was actually true.
[2:24:05.640 --> 2:24:08.880]  It's pretty clear the Russians detonated truck bombs and attacked government buildings
[2:24:08.880 --> 2:24:10.440]  on their border as a pretext.
[2:24:10.440 --> 2:24:11.960]  That's just what governments do.
[2:24:11.960 --> 2:24:14.240]  And so they're like, you're Alex Jones of the State Department.
[2:24:14.240 --> 2:24:15.240]  I don't like the State Department.
[2:24:15.240 --> 2:24:17.840]  I like the war, but they were telling the truth about false flags.
[2:24:17.840 --> 2:24:22.280]  So the idea that you shouldn't question things as a potential false flag makes no sense.
[2:24:22.280 --> 2:24:26.440]  And now the Russians are warning, the West is preparing a dirty bomb nuclear false flag,
[2:24:26.440 --> 2:24:30.800]  which I see all the pre-programming for, which I agree with as a major escalation that's
[2:24:30.800 --> 2:24:31.960]  going to lead to nuclear war.
[2:24:31.960 --> 2:24:36.440]  So I think it's very credible for America, for NATO, for the Russians, for everybody
[2:24:36.440 --> 2:24:40.240]  to look at who's going to do false flags, because false flags is one of the main cards
[2:24:40.240 --> 2:24:41.520]  in a toolkit.
[2:24:41.520 --> 2:24:48.160]  But they want the public politically, culturally, militarily, spiritually.
[2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:49.520]  What's the word I would use?
[2:24:49.520 --> 2:24:51.240]  Not just inept, but illiterate.
[2:24:51.240 --> 2:24:52.240]  Does that make sense?
[2:24:52.240 --> 2:24:53.240]  Yeah.
[2:24:53.240 --> 2:24:54.240]  That makes perfect sense.
[2:24:54.240 --> 2:24:56.840]  I mean, that's exactly what happened with this glowing pipeline thing.
[2:24:56.840 --> 2:24:58.840]  I mean, why, why else would they do that?
[2:24:58.840 --> 2:25:02.720]  And then all of a sudden they've got everything else shut down and now they come up with the
[2:25:02.720 --> 2:25:03.720]  money.
[2:25:03.720 --> 2:25:05.800]  I've got a buddy that's inspecting on that job right now and they're going to be working
[2:25:05.800 --> 2:25:08.000]  on it for a long period of time.
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:10.320]  You know, they've got all everything else artificially shut down.
[2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:13.040]  They're artificially creating food shortages.
[2:25:13.040 --> 2:25:17.080]  I mean, Mike Adams has been covering about the railroad situation and I mean, this is
[2:25:17.080 --> 2:25:18.080]  just insane.
[2:25:18.080 --> 2:25:19.080]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[2:25:19.080 --> 2:25:21.680]  It was four or five things you'd say it's an accident.
[2:25:21.680 --> 2:25:26.760]  Thousands of key points that are choke points are being directly sabotaged by federal bureaucrats
[2:25:26.760 --> 2:25:30.720]  because it's part of the Extinction Rebellion Environmentalist Doomsday Call.
[2:25:30.720 --> 2:25:32.600]  When I say that, folks, it's not rhetoric.
[2:25:32.600 --> 2:25:36.520]  The environmentalist, transhumanist Doomsday Call.
[2:25:36.520 --> 2:25:40.200]  The environmentalist, globalist, depopulation, Doomsday Call.
[2:25:40.200 --> 2:25:41.200]  That's what they are.
[2:25:41.200 --> 2:25:42.200]  We're all in grave danger.
[2:25:42.200 --> 2:25:43.200]  Yeah, it's global.
[2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:48.320]  I mean, it's, it's, you know, in the war in Ukraine, I mean, my wife, Ukrainian, I actually
[2:25:48.320 --> 2:25:50.000]  converted to orthodoxy.
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:54.320]  So I kind of prescribed to the Joel Scowls inside of things.
[2:25:54.320 --> 2:26:00.520]  But you can't deny 35% of the world's wheat comes from Ukraine and now that's going to
[2:26:00.520 --> 2:26:01.520]  be shut off.
[2:26:01.520 --> 2:26:02.520]  Yeah.
[2:26:02.520 --> 2:26:06.160]  The energy crisis, the supply chain breakdowns, hundreds of millions at the start of the death.
[2:26:06.160 --> 2:26:09.440]  We are living in the Extinction Rebellion by the globalist.
[2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:10.440]  Exactly.
[2:26:10.440 --> 2:26:14.520]  And, and, you know, with the border wide open, you know, what's going to happen when all
[2:26:14.520 --> 2:26:18.880]  these South American countries can't feed themselves with all the food supply shortages
[2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:20.280]  and artificial shutdowns and all that.
[2:26:20.280 --> 2:26:22.280]  They're going to collapse and come this way.
[2:26:22.280 --> 2:26:23.280]  Exactly.
[2:26:23.280 --> 2:26:24.280]  And then what happens then?
[2:26:24.280 --> 2:26:25.280]  I mean, we collapse.
[2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:27.280]  And I mean, that's why, I mean, I, I got out of the city.
[2:26:27.280 --> 2:26:31.080]  I mean, I thought I'm from Texas originally, so I'm a fellow, he's Texan, but, you know,
[2:26:31.080 --> 2:26:32.080]  I'm working in Nebraska.
[2:26:32.080 --> 2:26:35.520]  We bought a place out in the middle of nowhere in Nebraska and, you know, we were growing
[2:26:35.520 --> 2:26:38.840]  our own food and trying to live like our forefathers did.
[2:26:38.840 --> 2:26:40.800]  I mean, it's, it's all baked in the cake now.
[2:26:40.800 --> 2:26:41.800]  It doesn't matter what happens.
[2:26:41.800 --> 2:26:42.800]  This is, this is.
[2:26:42.800 --> 2:26:47.200]  That's what the leftist flipped out and said, Jones is a doomsday cult.
[2:26:47.200 --> 2:26:48.200]  He says the end it.
[2:26:48.200 --> 2:26:51.360]  No, I said the globalists are doomsday cult and they're trying to create an artificial
[2:26:51.360 --> 2:26:52.360]  collapse.
[2:26:52.360 --> 2:26:53.360]  We should stop it.
[2:26:53.360 --> 2:26:56.920]  I mean, they admitted all over the news and then we responded, oh, you're crazy.
[2:26:56.920 --> 2:26:57.920]  You want a doomsday cult?
[2:26:57.920 --> 2:26:59.440]  We're like, no, you're the doomsday cult.
[2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:02.960]  We want prosperity, which we can easily have.
[2:27:02.960 --> 2:27:03.960]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:27:03.960 --> 2:27:08.120]  And then, but they know they're creating artificial scarcity for control and manipulation
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:09.120]  and power.
[2:27:09.120 --> 2:27:13.400]  I mean, it looks like they say we want civil war and we want violence and no, I don't.
[2:27:13.400 --> 2:27:17.080]  They got the FBI and Justice Department with huge investigations open and some of the news
[2:27:17.080 --> 2:27:19.680]  that Jones ran January 6.
[2:27:19.680 --> 2:27:21.360]  Why would I make us look like idiots?
[2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:23.440]  Why would I destroy our chances of challenging elections?
[2:27:23.440 --> 2:27:25.640]  It's preposterous, but it doesn't matter.
[2:27:25.640 --> 2:27:26.640]  They don't care.
[2:27:26.640 --> 2:27:27.640]  They're moving forward.
[2:27:27.640 --> 2:27:29.200]  We can't back down to that.
[2:27:29.200 --> 2:27:30.200]  We have to tell the truth.
[2:27:30.200 --> 2:27:31.200]  Thank you for us.
[2:27:31.200 --> 2:27:32.200]  All right.
[2:27:32.200 --> 2:27:35.080]  I don't want to jam Austin in the only a minute and a half left from break.
[2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:36.080]  We'll go to Austin next.
[2:27:36.080 --> 2:27:43.640]  We're going to Matthew, Kentucky, Rebel, David, Stella, Dustin, Nathan, Nathan and Austin
[2:27:43.640 --> 2:27:44.800]  on the other side.
[2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:49.400]  Please remember, I can only stay on air because of your gracious.
[2:27:49.400 --> 2:27:53.240]  I live in your hands and I like a pit bull in a fight.
[2:27:53.240 --> 2:27:55.320]  I'll keep fighting till I die.
[2:27:55.320 --> 2:28:00.600]  I mean, it's just the way I am, but I cannot fight if we're not provided for because you
[2:28:00.600 --> 2:28:02.040]  have the meanest pit bull ever.
[2:28:02.040 --> 2:28:06.120]  If it's not getting fed food and given water, it will die.

[2:31:09.360 --> 2:31:14.200]  And people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our own infrastructure
[2:31:14.200 --> 2:31:18.520]  because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[2:31:18.520 --> 2:31:23.240]  And now, with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[2:31:23.240 --> 2:31:29.160]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[2:31:29.160 --> 2:31:30.160]  of charge.
[2:31:30.160 --> 2:31:34.920]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[2:31:34.920 --> 2:31:39.440]  Infowars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human-liberty
[2:31:39.440 --> 2:31:40.440]  movement worldwide.

[2:33:11.480 --> 2:33:16.080]  Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[2:33:16.080 --> 2:33:38.320]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:33:38.320 --> 2:33:44.320]  What a beautiful song.
[2:33:44.320 --> 2:33:53.640]  You know, I sit here, you're in the breaks looking at news thinking about what I'm about
[2:33:53.640 --> 2:33:54.640]  to cover next.
[2:33:54.640 --> 2:33:59.040]  And I just think about the fact that we use words to describe this, but people overuse
[2:33:59.040 --> 2:34:04.840]  words like they call everything bad Hitler and everything even good Hitler, so it loses
[2:34:04.840 --> 2:34:05.840]  its effect.
[2:34:05.840 --> 2:34:13.080]  But when we're here talking about the current time we're living in and the incredible awakening
[2:34:13.080 --> 2:34:18.360]  and the beautiful souls of every color and shape and creed who bleed red blood and love
[2:34:18.360 --> 2:34:24.560]  God coming together and we see the other bad guys on the other side, it is epic.
[2:34:24.560 --> 2:34:25.680]  It is incredible.
[2:34:25.680 --> 2:34:27.440]  It is amazing.
[2:34:27.440 --> 2:34:33.280]  And there's just not words to describe 28 years on air and being woken up and trained
[2:34:33.280 --> 2:34:37.720]  without even knowing by the best minds in the world against the New World Order because
[2:34:37.720 --> 2:34:41.240]  God was doing it.
[2:34:41.240 --> 2:34:43.800]  And now to be here with you.
[2:34:43.800 --> 2:34:45.040]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[2:34:45.040 --> 2:34:50.560]  I salute you all and I thank you all and I mean that I salute you all.
[2:34:50.560 --> 2:34:52.080]  I appreciate you.
[2:34:52.080 --> 2:34:57.320]  I am so blessed we're together and it is the greatest thing in my life to get to know all
[2:34:57.320 --> 2:34:58.840]  these beautiful souls.
[2:34:58.840 --> 2:35:03.360]  I really feel sad when I'm out in public and I see leftist particularly in cities like
[2:35:03.360 --> 2:35:07.840]  Seattle where there's just almost all of the zombies and they just hiss at you and scream
[2:35:07.840 --> 2:35:11.280]  at you and they look dead and you want to wake them up and then I'll be in a grocery
[2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:17.080]  store or a restaurant or a shopping mall or a doctor's office and I just see a black
[2:35:17.080 --> 2:35:24.320]  man or a black woman or a Hispanic lady or a white guy and their eyes are just so alive
[2:35:24.320 --> 2:35:26.480]  and you look at them and you just see it.
[2:35:26.480 --> 2:35:30.800]  It doesn't mean they've got classically beautiful features even a lot of them do.
[2:35:30.800 --> 2:35:36.440]  It's just like they're so genuine and they're so real and they're so loving and you're
[2:35:36.440 --> 2:35:43.920]  just like these are my people and it's so powerful.
[2:35:43.920 --> 2:35:45.640]  This crew has that look in their eyes.
[2:35:45.640 --> 2:35:51.000]  All of us have it that are awake and we just simply want others to have what we've got.
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:56.360]  But they've been told by the spirit that controls them that before they can be powerful we have
[2:35:56.360 --> 2:35:57.920]  to be extinguished.
[2:35:57.920 --> 2:35:59.000]  We have to be imprisoned.
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:00.360]  We have to be shut up.
[2:36:00.360 --> 2:36:01.360]  We have to be bullied.
[2:36:01.360 --> 2:36:05.160]  We have to be exterminated because our strength makes them fearful.
[2:36:05.160 --> 2:36:10.240]  When I look at a man who's strong and powerful and got a beautiful woman and a beautiful
[2:36:10.240 --> 2:36:14.960]  house and a beautiful everything I don't feel like I hate him.
[2:36:14.960 --> 2:36:22.400]  That's part of my wealth but see a globalist, a minion of evil they don't like senior success
[2:36:22.400 --> 2:36:26.840]  and the more powerful you are spiritually the more the system is going to try to drive
[2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:29.000]  you down and dominate you.
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:33.360]  So I tell you this and I'll tell you this a thousand times I told you at once and I
[2:36:33.360 --> 2:36:39.160]  want you to listen and listen good and I'll go back to your calls and I say a lot of important
[2:36:39.160 --> 2:36:40.160]  things but this is important.
[2:36:40.160 --> 2:36:45.160]  I want you to listen real good and I want this to sink in real good.
[2:36:45.160 --> 2:36:47.080]  You can't beat Satan on your own.
[2:36:47.080 --> 2:36:48.080]  I've tried it.
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:52.200]  Not even consciously but I still felt like I could do it even though I was calling on
[2:36:52.200 --> 2:36:56.320]  God it was kind of like a well yeah I'll call God a little bit I can do this I can handle
[2:36:56.320 --> 2:37:03.160]  this and then God will show you that you better humble yourself you better get on your knees
[2:37:03.160 --> 2:37:07.840]  you better roll up your sleeves you better ask God for guidance and support and you're
[2:37:07.840 --> 2:37:08.840]  not going to make it.
[2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:15.400]  It's only going to be God that carries us through this so on all of you now listening
[2:37:15.400 --> 2:37:20.320]  to me to call on God and his son Jesus Christ to near heart and soul to clear your mind
[2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:26.400]  like King David talked about and push out that evil and have you be reborn and strong
[2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:30.960]  and then together we can start beating this thing and it's so much better when you finally
[2:37:30.960 --> 2:37:31.960]  surrender to Christ.
[2:37:31.960 --> 2:37:36.960]  Even if you already love God even though you're a good person you know what I'm talking about
[2:37:36.960 --> 2:37:40.440]  you have this feeling like you got to do it it's not an arrogance it's all you know is
[2:37:40.440 --> 2:37:45.120]  what you got you got to turn loose of that and say I'm going to fight this evil but
[2:37:45.120 --> 2:37:50.520]  I'm going to ask God into me to do it and then I'm going to do whatever God tells me
[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:56.480]  and then we will break the evil but only through God.
[2:37:56.480 --> 2:38:03.640]  Only way to beat this is with God we don't have a hope with God we have absolute pure
[2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:09.680]  victory with a capital V we have total completion we got to dial into the person that made us
[2:38:09.680 --> 2:38:15.080]  the God that made us we got to dial into the creature that the omnipresent power that made
[2:38:15.080 --> 2:38:22.120]  the entire existence and then created us with his mind.
[2:38:22.120 --> 2:38:31.240]  You will be defeated if you fight Satan on your own but if you ask God in you are invincible.
[2:38:31.240 --> 2:38:32.960]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:37.080]  Austin in Ohio you're on the air worldwide thank you for calling.
[2:38:37.080 --> 2:38:44.080]  Alex Jones amen that's amazing sir I'm so glad that you just made mention of that because
[2:38:44.080 --> 2:38:47.840]  it's going to segue into exactly what I was going to mention I wanted to speak a little
[2:38:47.840 --> 2:38:52.480]  bit about Elon Musk but first I wanted to thank you for being like you said the tip
[2:38:52.480 --> 2:38:58.800]  of the spear in the forefront of the information where I'm a 29 year old male and I've been
[2:38:58.800 --> 2:39:04.880]  watching you and studying what you've dug into on the occult, the Bohemian Grove and
[2:39:04.880 --> 2:39:10.320]  other places, the Skull and Bone Society and that has really catapulted me on to this
[2:39:10.320 --> 2:39:16.520]  road and this path of truth finding and to kind of connecting the dots with everything.
[2:39:16.520 --> 2:39:21.600]  I wanted to mention Elon Musk because I know he's the people's billionaire, he's the Batman,
[2:39:21.600 --> 2:39:24.000]  the Iron Man, whatever you want to call him.
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:26.240]  But could he be a deception?
[2:39:26.240 --> 2:39:27.240]  Is he the false hope?
[2:39:27.240 --> 2:39:28.880]  I think we should all be asking that.
[2:39:28.880 --> 2:39:31.360]  Absolutely, that's what I was going to say.
[2:39:31.360 --> 2:39:32.640]  Albert Pike was a general.
[2:39:32.640 --> 2:39:35.320]  I was about to say that as I walked in here.
[2:39:35.320 --> 2:39:36.320]  Go ahead.
[2:39:36.320 --> 2:39:39.400]  The Holy Spirit's great brother we're thinking the same.
[2:39:39.400 --> 2:39:40.400]  Albert Pike was a general.
[2:39:40.400 --> 2:39:43.160]  Well now you're in the break I was going to come out and say it I forgot so God made
[2:39:43.160 --> 2:39:44.840]  sure it happened through you.
[2:39:44.840 --> 2:39:45.840]  Exactly.
[2:39:45.840 --> 2:39:50.240]  All the internet of things, they've got their AI, we've got the real AI.
[2:39:50.240 --> 2:39:51.240]  That's it.
[2:39:51.240 --> 2:39:54.760]  Albert Pike was a Confederate general and more importantly he was a 33 degree Mason.
[2:39:54.760 --> 2:39:57.160]  And the founder of the KKK.
[2:39:57.160 --> 2:39:58.160]  Yep.
[2:39:58.160 --> 2:40:03.520]  And he was a very influential and a father figure of modern occultism and Luciferian
[2:40:03.520 --> 2:40:09.640]  and Satanism and he was quoted by saying whenever the people need a hero, we shall supply him.
[2:40:09.640 --> 2:40:14.800]  And I think we ought to be a little bit careful with Elon Musk here being the savior of freedom
[2:40:14.800 --> 2:40:22.560]  of speech but his mother's a well known supermodel who is well known to have the one eye symbolism
[2:40:22.560 --> 2:40:25.720]  and so it's constant gaslighting, right?
[2:40:25.720 --> 2:40:29.440]  All these things are happening and Trump's the bad guy and then that happens and we're
[2:40:29.440 --> 2:40:33.440]  in the Biden administration and all these things are happening in the background but
[2:40:33.440 --> 2:40:38.120]  now Russia's the bad guy and Ukraine is the good guy when all the corruption in the Hunter
[2:40:38.120 --> 2:40:44.240]  Biden's laptop comes through and then how about all the supply chain breakdowns and
[2:40:44.240 --> 2:40:48.760]  all of these fires happening in the distribution chains and they're airing Johnny Depp but
[2:40:48.760 --> 2:40:54.480]  they didn't do Ghislaine Maxwell, I mean it's nothing but gaslighting, it's nothing but
[2:40:54.480 --> 2:40:59.560]  a satanic cult that is strategically planning behind the scenes.
[2:40:59.560 --> 2:41:05.960]  I agree and they've got three Sandy Hook trials lined up this summer and fall, 14 weeks of
[2:41:05.960 --> 2:41:10.200]  it where every channel as Alex Jones is mean to children and free speech is bad and that's
[2:41:10.200 --> 2:41:15.680]  why they're so pissed, we declared bankruptcy which put a little bit of a cattywampus into
[2:41:15.680 --> 2:41:16.680]  their operation.
[2:41:16.680 --> 2:41:24.560]  Absolutely and I want to say that things might be bleak, the new world order is not happening
[2:41:24.560 --> 2:41:29.200]  it's here, the bee system is being set up and we have to be careful with Elon Musk,
[2:41:29.200 --> 2:41:33.560]  he's the same guy that wants to put a chip in our brain and set us up to that beast mark
[2:41:33.560 --> 2:41:35.240]  of the beast type system, right?
[2:41:35.240 --> 2:41:40.760]  So just like you were saying, we cannot beat the powers of sin, death and hell and Satan
[2:41:40.760 --> 2:41:45.240]  by ourselves, it's only through the power and authority that Jesus Christ has given
[2:41:45.240 --> 2:41:50.160]  us, just like the demons that confronted some of the apostles that said, we know who Paul
[2:41:50.160 --> 2:41:53.400]  is, we know who Jesus is but who are you?
[2:41:53.400 --> 2:41:59.600]  We can't go fight this on a nationalist patriotism mindset, we have to operate with a power.
[2:41:59.600 --> 2:42:03.520]  It's purely a spiritual war and we can't even go to the mainline churches because they're
[2:42:03.520 --> 2:42:07.960]  counter controlled, we have to make a connection to God and then do the right thing.
[2:42:07.960 --> 2:42:12.040]  But I'm not going to poo poo Elon Musk if he does some good things, but at the same
[2:42:12.040 --> 2:42:18.000]  time we cannot trust in man as you said, we have to trust in God.
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:22.120]  Absolutely brother, that's it, error on the side of caution, always look at what's behind
[2:42:22.120 --> 2:42:25.760]  the scenes and what the big story is because there's something else happening behind us.
[2:42:25.760 --> 2:42:30.440]  Beautifully said Austin, thank you for the call from Ohio, alright we're going to go to break

[2:47:31.240 --> 2:47:35.440]  calls right now, very blessed to be here, let's talk to Nathan and Tennessee, Nathan
[2:47:35.440 --> 2:47:36.440]  you're on the air.
[2:47:36.440 --> 2:47:42.080]  Hey, how you doing brother, I just want to amen everything you said earlier and this
[2:47:42.080 --> 2:47:48.680]  is a spiritual battle and I wanted to encourage you and strengthen you that you don't need
[2:47:48.680 --> 2:47:54.080]  to be afraid of running out, you don't need to be afraid of being shut down, you don't
[2:47:54.080 --> 2:47:58.520]  need to be afraid of not having the funds to go on, you just need to keep doing what's
[2:47:58.520 --> 2:48:04.680]  right Alex, even if it means, you know, literal death or figurative death or whatever it may
[2:48:04.680 --> 2:48:09.800]  be that you don't need to worry about that, quit spending so much time and energy on that
[2:48:09.800 --> 2:48:13.880]  I agree, but I've had the Democratic Party off record, I can't say who directly reach
[2:48:13.880 --> 2:48:17.760]  out months ago and say, we will put you in prison or kill you if you don't do this this
[2:48:17.760 --> 2:48:21.160]  and that and obviously I'm not going to back down, it's just I want the listeners to understand
[2:48:21.160 --> 2:48:27.040]  how dangerous it is, how much danger we're all in, these people are pure evil.
[2:48:27.040 --> 2:48:31.960]  I understand and that's why it's important for us just to keep walking in love and forgiveness
[2:48:31.960 --> 2:48:36.920]  and being the example on the light and the darkness and I just really want to say thank
[2:48:36.920 --> 2:48:40.680]  you brother, I appreciate everything that you're doing, I know I called to talk about
[2:48:40.680 --> 2:48:45.840]  Elon Musk but I've been praying about what to say the whole time and I'm a combat veteran
[2:48:45.840 --> 2:48:51.560]  and you know, I just really appreciate everything that you're doing and I appreciate you, I'm
[2:48:51.560 --> 2:48:54.560]  very thankful to be in this position, I just want to keep fighting and I get what you're
[2:48:54.560 --> 2:48:59.000]  saying, turn over to God and I'm still a simple creature, I don't want to lose, but I get
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:00.800]  it, God's going to win in the end.
[2:49:00.800 --> 2:49:04.760]  Yeah, and what you said is true, you know, you're in the end, you're going to realize
[2:49:04.760 --> 2:49:09.160]  it's not you, it's going to be God that does it and we just have to be willing servants
[2:49:09.160 --> 2:49:12.680]  of God to keep doing what he'd have us do every day and that goes for everybody, don't
[2:49:12.680 --> 2:49:16.920]  lose hope because that's it, the future is our hope and you know, I want to give a shout
[2:49:16.920 --> 2:49:21.480]  out real quick, I made my 12 year old son is listening in the other room and you know,
[2:49:21.480 --> 2:49:22.480]  we love you Alex.
[2:49:22.480 --> 2:49:26.840]  I was about to say it's all about our children brother, talk about that exactly, it's all
[2:49:26.840 --> 2:49:30.920]  about them, they know they're losing, that's why they're targeting our children.
[2:49:30.920 --> 2:49:34.600]  That's what keeps me going on, you know, is every time I face these battles, every time
[2:49:34.600 --> 2:49:38.840]  I feel down, I look at them and I realize it's about their future, you know, it's about
[2:49:38.840 --> 2:49:42.320]  what's going to happen, we have to forget about what's been done and start to turn
[2:49:42.320 --> 2:49:45.520]  this around, start to turn around the economy, start to turn around all of you.
[2:49:45.520 --> 2:49:48.440]  And we've got to forget about what's going to happen to us individually and just commit
[2:49:48.440 --> 2:49:54.360]  to the children, absolutely, any time, because I don't get scared very often, it's not even
[2:49:54.360 --> 2:49:57.560]  scared, it's more of a frustration and anger, literally in the middle of the night God touches
[2:49:57.560 --> 2:50:03.160]  me and says, think about the children, stand up for them, and I'm ashamed of even my any
[2:50:03.160 --> 2:50:06.880]  of my doubts, it's like, yes, I'm going to stand, because we saw kids getting killed
[2:50:06.880 --> 2:50:09.720]  right in front of us, we fight and die for them, well they're getting killed and we
[2:50:09.720 --> 2:50:12.520]  got to stand up for them.
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:16.160]  Well that's why I call just to strengthen your brother and let you know that we're praying
[2:50:16.160 --> 2:50:22.120]  together on that and don't lose hope and just hopefully Lord willing, one of these days
[2:50:22.120 --> 2:50:25.360]  I'll have a chance to look you in the eye and shake your hand and give you a big hug,
[2:50:25.360 --> 2:50:29.120]  you know, but in the meantime, this is been great for now and I'll let somebody else
[2:50:29.120 --> 2:50:30.120]  take it.
[2:50:30.120 --> 2:50:31.120]  I appreciate your brother and God bless you.
[2:50:31.120 --> 2:50:34.440]  My biggest frustration is it's all out in the open now and it's going to get so much
[2:50:34.440 --> 2:50:35.440]  worse we don't stop it.
[2:50:35.440 --> 2:50:40.960]  And I realize it's all foretold, it's going to get a lot worse, but it's just so unbelievable
[2:50:40.960 --> 2:50:46.720]  there's this many evil people, but it's just it's it's it's it's free will and it's happening.
[2:50:46.720 --> 2:50:50.400]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matthew in New York, Matthew, thanks for calling.
[2:50:50.400 --> 2:50:56.560]  Hello, Alex, it's an honor and a pleasure to talk to you back at you.
[2:50:56.560 --> 2:51:00.680]  First of all, let me give you a little bit of a plug for the cruel oil.
[2:51:00.680 --> 2:51:05.920]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed with AFib, if anybody knows what AFib is, the danger is
[2:51:05.920 --> 2:51:10.120]  that your blood clots and you suffer from a stroke.
[2:51:10.120 --> 2:51:17.440]  Fast forward a couple of years, I was getting ready to have a colonoscopy and in my pre-screening,
[2:51:17.440 --> 2:51:23.560]  they told me to stop taking the krill oil because it is a blood center, so you don't
[2:51:23.560 --> 2:51:28.320]  need the pharmaceutical blood centers and all the bruises on your hands, krill oil
[2:51:28.320 --> 2:51:29.320]  works.
[2:51:29.320 --> 2:51:33.920]  Well, all the studies show it does, we have the highest grade krill oil that's out there,
[2:51:33.920 --> 2:51:39.200]  but it's well known for heart and cardiovascular health, that and fish oil, absolutely.
[2:51:39.200 --> 2:51:42.200]  I love it.
[2:51:42.200 --> 2:51:48.120]  I had a thought a while back and I just wanted to pick your brain on it.
[2:51:48.120 --> 2:51:49.520]  It was kind of weird.
[2:51:49.520 --> 2:51:57.120]  I just thought that does the second coming of Jesus Christ actually require a physical
[2:51:57.120 --> 2:52:04.720]  presence or is it the awakening of the spirit within each of us that brings about the second
[2:52:04.720 --> 2:52:05.720]  coming?
[2:52:05.720 --> 2:52:11.480]  I mean, I think it's both and again, I'm not bashing folks who talk about pre-tribulation
[2:52:11.480 --> 2:52:16.120]  raptors, but I can read the Bible, it clearly comes after the battle and the dead are raised
[2:52:16.120 --> 2:52:20.560]  in Christ, but regardless, God's not going to recognize us and we don't fight evil,
[2:52:20.560 --> 2:52:24.960]  so all the Christians out there and I'm not putting you down and I'm not lecturing you,
[2:52:24.960 --> 2:52:29.560]  I'm telling you, obviously if you don't fight evil and you don't speak out against it,
[2:52:29.560 --> 2:52:33.400]  I'm not saying I'm perfect either, but if you don't try, God's not going to recognize
[2:52:33.400 --> 2:52:38.920]  you at the white throne judgment, so if you don't put skin in the game and say, oh, I
[2:52:38.920 --> 2:52:43.400]  was going to get raptured out because I magically said I was with Jesus, Jesus had to go to
[2:52:43.400 --> 2:52:46.360]  a cross and get tortured to death to rise again.
[2:52:46.360 --> 2:52:50.400]  We are going to have to go through some serious pain for this.
[2:52:50.400 --> 2:53:02.960]  So I'm not a real believer in a rapture, but is the story of Christ that we have to suffer
[2:53:02.960 --> 2:53:06.320]  to achieve eternal life?
[2:53:06.320 --> 2:53:12.400]  No, I think we have to choose God and be reborn, but with that the world's going to
[2:53:12.400 --> 2:53:14.440]  persecute us, we have to be willing to do it.
[2:53:14.440 --> 2:53:21.040]  Ah, that's the thing, it's the evil that fights against the good.
[2:53:21.040 --> 2:53:26.360]  Yeah, God's not going to torture you, but evil is, so you've got to be ready for that,
[2:53:26.360 --> 2:53:32.200]  but it's a few minutes, a few hours of torturing the hell out of you and then it's Valhalla,
[2:53:32.200 --> 2:53:36.480]  rather after that, and they can make fun of that, but this is a test, this whole planet,
[2:53:36.480 --> 2:53:41.320]  this whole universe was made just to test us, this whole thing is not a simulation, it's
[2:53:41.320 --> 2:53:46.760]  a real world operation of creatures that are going to have free will and be ready to take
[2:53:46.760 --> 2:53:52.440]  command of incredible things, but first we've got to prove that we're not going to hurt
[2:53:52.440 --> 2:53:54.680]  small people and be pieces of crap.
[2:53:54.680 --> 2:53:57.960]  God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[2:53:57.960 --> 2:54:04.760]  I'm not going to even get into it, but let's go ahead and take another call here, let's
[2:54:04.760 --> 2:54:05.760]  jam in.
[2:54:05.760 --> 2:54:08.760]  David in California, David, welcome.
[2:54:08.760 --> 2:54:11.400]  Hey, how are you doing Alex?
[2:54:11.400 --> 2:54:13.960]  I'm good to be here with you brother.
[2:54:13.960 --> 2:54:14.960]  That's good.
[2:54:14.960 --> 2:54:19.200]  Before I start this message, I'd like to say to the call, to the listeners that go to life
[2:54:19.200 --> 2:54:20.720]  is to have a return on life.
[2:54:20.720 --> 2:54:24.720]  I wasn't going to speak about Elon Musk, but I want to stick to the subject that's going
[2:54:24.720 --> 2:54:27.640]  on right now because I have some big news today.
[2:54:27.640 --> 2:54:31.080]  If you don't mind Alex, could you write this down for me?
[2:54:31.080 --> 2:54:32.080]  Sure.
[2:54:32.080 --> 2:54:36.880]  It's called ectoplasma specialization, ectoplasma specialization.
[2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:39.800]  If you could just look into that and everything would be explained.
[2:54:39.800 --> 2:54:43.080]  Let's cut the head off this giant today.
[2:54:43.080 --> 2:54:45.320]  Again once again, my name is David.
[2:54:45.320 --> 2:54:49.800]  You have God, you have Jesus, you have the Holy Ghost, you have the spirit, you have
[2:54:49.800 --> 2:54:53.320]  the body, you have the soul, which is the mind.
[2:54:53.320 --> 2:54:58.600]  People need to understand that the soul is the mind, which is what we take with us when
[2:54:58.600 --> 2:55:00.800]  God takes our spirit.
[2:55:00.800 --> 2:55:06.720]  God has all the power and only the power to keep the spirit bound in hell.
[2:55:06.720 --> 2:55:11.000]  So that's the reason why the demon says, I want your soul.
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:14.200]  We're the ones who make the choices to not self the hell.
[2:55:14.200 --> 2:55:23.000]  So once again, God, Jesus, the Holy Ghost, spirit, body, the soul, slash the mind.
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:26.120]  You have just the reason why the number three is so important to them.
[2:55:26.120 --> 2:55:28.880]  You have the domain, which is their spirit.
[2:55:28.880 --> 2:55:31.040]  You have the host, which is their body.
[2:55:31.040 --> 2:55:35.400]  You have the SEO slash algorithms, which is their Holy Ghost.
[2:55:35.400 --> 2:55:39.560]  They are stuck in the sixth sense, which we have been trained and taught, which the Brown
[2:55:39.560 --> 2:55:44.400]  Report has reported about this, and I have called in about this 10 months ago and spoke
[2:55:44.400 --> 2:55:47.080]  about this, which they use remote viewing.
[2:55:47.080 --> 2:55:51.520]  Our sense, Alex, the people of good use the seventh sense, we're trying to reach the seventh
[2:55:51.520 --> 2:55:52.520]  sense.
[2:55:52.520 --> 2:55:56.560]  Be like God creatures, be without sin, because it's our choice of sin once we know right
[2:55:56.560 --> 2:55:58.400]  from wrong.
[2:55:58.400 --> 2:56:03.080]  And our message, our connection, which is not a connection, we're in tuned.
[2:56:03.080 --> 2:56:07.880]  And that is the Holy Ghost, which is your Vax bus story, when you explain to the guy
[2:56:07.880 --> 2:56:15.240]  about the vaccine towards kids, and then the Vax bus drove up, just like the caller Carlos
[2:56:15.240 --> 2:56:19.720]  from Canada, when he speaks about the Holy Ghost and how it travels.
[2:56:19.720 --> 2:56:22.960]  That's our in tune, being in tune with God.
[2:56:22.960 --> 2:56:23.960]  They need a connection.
[2:56:23.960 --> 2:56:24.960]  No, you're right.
[2:56:24.960 --> 2:56:25.960]  We're not in connection.
[2:56:25.960 --> 2:56:26.960]  We're aligned.
[2:56:26.960 --> 2:56:29.960]  That's correct.
[2:56:29.960 --> 2:56:37.320]  And that's why the the transition, the transition, the transition is just like you said, on Joe
[2:56:37.320 --> 2:56:42.600]  Rogan, your spot, Spotify interview with them, it's called the ghost in the machine, which
[2:56:42.600 --> 2:56:45.160]  Mike Adams was speaking about the guy named Charles.
[2:56:45.160 --> 2:56:52.040]  I think his last name is Libra uses a EMP as a heart, he uses a human brain, he uses
[2:56:52.040 --> 2:56:58.120]  the tubes that connects, they substitute as the quartet, quartet or arteries, they connect
[2:56:58.120 --> 2:57:00.840]  to the left and the right brain.
[2:57:00.840 --> 2:57:05.800]  They use 3D bioprinter for skin, for fake skin.
[2:57:05.800 --> 2:57:10.920]  And this is how, and then you have the synthetic echoplasma that runs through tubes.
[2:57:10.920 --> 2:57:14.800]  Now, this is how they end up with the ghost in the machine.
[2:57:14.800 --> 2:57:15.800]  They think you're right.
[2:57:15.800 --> 2:57:17.800]  That's what they want is a synthetic human.
[2:57:17.800 --> 2:57:18.800]  They want to be God.
[2:57:18.800 --> 2:57:22.920]  The devil's rebellion, originally powerful, David, could talk to you for hours.
[2:57:22.920 --> 2:57:23.920]  Thank you.
[2:57:23.920 --> 2:57:26.280]  Stella and Dustin, we're going to break.
[2:57:26.280 --> 2:57:27.920]  You're going to have two and a half minutes of peace.
[2:57:27.920 --> 2:57:31.920]  And then Kate Daly takes over in the fourth hour for 55 minutes.
[2:57:31.920 --> 2:57:37.280]  And then Owen Schreuer with the war room, infowars.com, four slash show, and carried
[2:57:37.280 --> 2:57:39.200]  on stages across the nation.
[2:57:39.200 --> 2:57:40.280]  Stay with us.
[2:57:40.280 --> 2:57:46.600]  Our number four is two minutes away.
[2:57:46.600 --> 2:57:52.560]  UN estimates that over 2 billion people alive on Earth today have cognitive disabilities,
[2:57:52.560 --> 2:57:57.720]  lower IQs, and so many other medical issues because of one thing, iodine deficiency.
[2:57:57.720 --> 2:58:03.240]  And most iodine that you get from different foods is bound to other minerals or other
[2:58:03.240 --> 2:58:06.240]  compounds, so it's not absorbable in the body.
[2:58:06.240 --> 2:58:08.960]  And that's why iodine deficiency is such a huge issue.
[2:58:08.960 --> 2:58:13.000]  We have the purest, cleanest, best iodine in the world from deep-reth crystals more
[2:58:13.000 --> 2:58:18.280]  than 7,000 feet deep, X2 is an amazing product, and it has been sold out for months and months
[2:58:18.280 --> 2:58:19.280]  and months.

[2:58:24.120 --> 2:58:27.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, with all the supply chain breakdowns and the rest of it, I'm not sure
[2:58:27.000 --> 2:58:32.360]  when the next time we're going to get X2 is, so I would stock up on X2 right now at infowars.com
[2:58:32.360 --> 2:58:36.080]  and know that you're funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[2:58:36.080 --> 2:58:37.520]  That's a 360 win.

[2:58:47.000 --> 2:58:55.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowars.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20-year history.
[2:58:55.880 --> 2:59:00.800]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[2:59:00.800 --> 2:59:06.600]  have broken down, and info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying
[2:59:06.600 --> 2:59:11.360]  for operations, and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists
[2:59:11.360 --> 2:59:12.800]  making their main move.
[2:59:12.800 --> 2:59:16.920]  Info wars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people than
[2:59:16.920 --> 2:59:21.520]  ever despite the censorship, but because of cost increasing and having to run our own
[2:59:21.520 --> 2:59:26.120]  infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth, everything else, we are running out of money
[2:59:26.120 --> 2:59:27.120]  solicit.

[2:59:45.840 --> 3:00:01.840]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:00:01.840 --> 3:00:06.880]  Well it's the final segment I'm hosting and Kate Daly takes over, we're taking calls
[3:00:06.880 --> 3:00:11.880]  now from South Carolina and Kansas, Dustin in South Carolina, welcome.
[3:00:11.880 --> 3:00:12.880]  Hello?
[3:00:12.880 --> 3:00:14.880]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[3:00:14.880 --> 3:00:25.200]  I just want to agree with you, a minute ago you said there's a spiritual war and they
[3:00:25.200 --> 3:00:30.600]  are definitely coming for our kids with the trans agenda and all that crap, but there
[3:00:30.600 --> 3:00:39.720]  is an Illinois, it started there, the satanic temple started after school satan club and
[3:00:39.720 --> 3:00:45.400]  it approved Illinois, Pennsylvania shot it down, I don't know what school it was, but
[3:00:45.400 --> 3:00:51.280]  there's a school in Greensboro, South third, Greensboro, North Carolina that is, they're
[3:00:51.280 --> 3:00:56.600]  starting up their after school satan club this week on Friday.
[3:00:56.600 --> 3:01:01.480]  That's right, it's a total coming out of satanism pedophilia, you name it.
[3:01:01.480 --> 3:01:08.880]  Yeah, it's just crazy, the Bible says anyone that calls one of these little ones to stumble,
[3:01:08.880 --> 3:01:14.520]  it would be better for them to have a stone around their neck and cast into the waters,
[3:01:14.520 --> 3:01:21.960]  but it's our job to pose this stuff and it's just crazy all that satanic stuff going on
[3:01:21.960 --> 3:01:25.280]  and it's just crazy man.
[3:01:25.280 --> 3:01:29.240]  Well we haven't stood up for ourselves and so God has lifted the hedge around us and
[3:01:29.240 --> 3:01:33.120]  evil is coming in, but we're going to counter it and there's a good awakening happening,
[3:01:33.120 --> 3:01:36.360]  a big awakening happening right now, so have faith my friend.
[3:01:36.360 --> 3:01:45.080]  That's right, that's right, I just want to plug real quick, I get the vitamin, the D3
[3:01:45.080 --> 3:01:50.200]  gummies and the whole food vitamins and the immune support and all of that stuff and it
[3:01:50.200 --> 3:01:52.720]  definitely works, it definitely works.
[3:01:52.720 --> 3:01:57.440]  Well thank you Dustin for not just supporting us on air, but taking care of your own body,
[3:01:57.440 --> 3:02:00.560]  we wouldn't be here without you, so we thank you Dustin, God bless you.
[3:02:00.560 --> 3:02:05.720]  Alright, last caller before Kate Daly takes over, Stella in Kansas, you're on the air,
[3:02:05.720 --> 3:02:06.720]  welcome.
[3:02:06.720 --> 3:02:07.720]  Hello, Alec.
[3:02:07.720 --> 3:02:08.720]  Welcome.
[3:02:08.720 --> 3:02:15.040]  I just wanted to run an idea across you, I don't know if it'll work, I don't know if
[3:02:15.040 --> 3:02:21.200]  anything's going to work now, but what do you think about having like a national call
[3:02:21.200 --> 3:02:26.720]  in day to the White House letting them know that we will all stand together and we will
[3:02:26.720 --> 3:02:28.800]  stand and fight for our freedom.
[3:02:28.800 --> 3:02:32.840]  You know I think it's always important to call Congress and call the White House, but
[3:02:32.840 --> 3:02:36.800]  I think they know we're awake, I think they know we're the enemy, that's why they're declaring
[3:02:36.800 --> 3:02:40.960]  you know anybody protesting their tyranny as a terrorist, they have no legitimate power,
[3:02:40.960 --> 3:02:46.040]  they're a joke, but yeah, everything is good, resistance is good because it opens your mind
[3:02:46.040 --> 3:02:49.600]  up to what you're doing, it gets you in the action of doing it, even if what you do has
[3:02:49.600 --> 3:02:55.200]  little effect, over time it lenses, it amplifies.
[3:02:55.200 --> 3:02:59.400]  Well I mean like slam them with the calls to let them know that we are here and we are
[3:02:59.400 --> 3:03:04.760]  together, we're not alone, they won't lock us down again and we will stand and fight.
[3:03:04.760 --> 3:03:10.160]  No, I agree with you, getting mayors and city council and legislators and governors elected
[3:03:10.160 --> 3:03:13.680]  that will not put up with the next lockdown is key because it's common they admit it is,
[3:03:13.680 --> 3:03:17.320]  you're absolutely right, we've got to really keep pushing harder now than ever.
[3:03:17.320 --> 3:03:21.040]  So they push their agenda, we wake up and push back, they go away, but they admit they're
[3:03:21.040 --> 3:03:22.240]  about to come right back.
[3:03:22.240 --> 3:03:27.560]  Exactly, but if you could, if you could air a day, a special day for all of us to call
[3:03:27.560 --> 3:03:33.680]  in to the White House on that day and I know it'll take a couple weeks for everybody to
[3:03:33.680 --> 3:03:39.040]  get through, but if we just in a date, I'm in a date, I'm with those calls, maybe, I
[3:03:39.040 --> 3:03:43.480]  don't know, maybe to you know, shift something, I don't know, and then I think it was Trump
[3:03:43.480 --> 3:03:48.080]  that would have an effect, Biden probably they ignore it, but legislators and governors,
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:53.320]  how about a day where we call our governors, we call our legislators because they're really
[3:03:53.320 --> 3:03:56.960]  listening, but not so much the White House and I'm not saying you're wrong, call the
[3:03:56.960 --> 3:03:57.960]  White House too.
[3:03:57.960 --> 3:04:04.480]  But not, but not just the Republicans, senators and governors, but also the Democrats, just
[3:04:04.480 --> 3:04:08.040]  because we're Republicans doesn't mean we can't call our Democrats.
[3:04:08.040 --> 3:04:11.360]  I think writing letters and calling lets them know we're aware of them and what they're
[3:04:11.360 --> 3:04:15.600]  doing I think it's a very positive thing, so I totally agree with you Stella.
[3:04:15.600 --> 3:04:20.680]  So maybe you could come up with just one day for us all just to start that.
[3:04:20.680 --> 3:04:21.680]  Stella you have these.
[3:04:21.680 --> 3:04:27.120]  I mean, I know they watch you, so if you're announcing people call them, you know, they're
[3:04:27.120 --> 3:04:28.480]  going to know we're going to call.
[3:04:28.480 --> 3:04:29.480]  It's a good idea.
[3:04:29.480 --> 3:04:31.280]  Stella, what a beautiful name means the stars.
[3:04:31.280 --> 3:04:34.160]  All right, we'll be right back with Kate Daly's about to take over.

[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:49.760]  World War III is very close in Ukraine.
[3:04:49.760 --> 3:04:51.760]  Kate Daly takes over right now.
[3:04:51.760 --> 3:04:56.760]  Stay with us.
[3:04:56.760 --> 3:05:01.240]  Introducing the newest product from infowarslife.com.

[3:05:52.480 --> 3:06:04.440]  Take action now infowarsstore.com Hi, welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:06:04.440 --> 3:06:05.440]  So glad to be here today.
[3:06:05.440 --> 3:06:06.880]  I just hope you're having a great day.
[3:06:06.880 --> 3:06:09.400]  I hope you're having a great week, actually.
[3:06:09.400 --> 3:06:12.680]  And boy, do we live in interesting times, am I right?
[3:06:12.680 --> 3:06:13.680]  Welcome back.
[3:06:13.680 --> 3:06:16.000]  And by the way, get the X2, get the iodine.
[3:06:16.000 --> 3:06:17.000]  Great products.
[3:06:17.000 --> 3:06:18.000]  I'm serious.
[3:06:18.000 --> 3:06:21.160]  These are great products and everybody needs them in mass.
[3:06:21.160 --> 3:06:25.160]  You need to order in mass, really and truly, and stock up.
[3:06:25.160 --> 3:06:30.560]  So the distractions, of course, Johnny Depp and Elon Musk, total distractions, who cares
[3:06:30.560 --> 3:06:36.040]  who owns Twitter, and we're not forced to be on any social media, so it's absolutely ridiculous
[3:06:36.040 --> 3:06:37.040]  who owns it.
[3:06:37.040 --> 3:06:39.800]  And by the way, we already know who is running the thing.
[3:06:39.800 --> 3:06:43.240]  All they're talking about is who's going to be the face of it.
[3:06:43.240 --> 3:06:47.000]  And what is important, well, today I have an explosive guest.
[3:06:47.000 --> 3:06:50.000]  We're going to talk about what is important us.
[3:06:50.000 --> 3:06:54.360]  We are important, the Patriots of America and this great country.
[3:06:54.360 --> 3:06:55.360]  We are important.
[3:06:55.360 --> 3:07:00.760]  And more importantly, how we're going to get through these next several years, because
[3:07:00.760 --> 3:07:05.520]  I'm going to think that our biggest threats right now, after all the research that I do,
[3:07:05.520 --> 3:07:12.200]  are basically being incarcerated for mental health reasons when it's completely bogus.
[3:07:12.200 --> 3:07:19.640]  And of course, being entrapped by those that infiltrate Patriot groups to take down the
[3:07:19.640 --> 3:07:25.680]  Patriots of America and probably throw them in prison because they can, because they can
[3:07:25.680 --> 3:07:30.200]  put you in on bogus charges, as we just learned from January 6th and other events too that
[3:07:30.200 --> 3:07:31.200]  I've covered.
[3:07:31.200 --> 3:07:32.920]  I've been on the radio for about 10 years.
[3:07:32.920 --> 3:07:36.720]  I've covered a lot of FBI entrapment cases.
[3:07:36.720 --> 3:07:42.080]  And this one is one of the biggest I've seen and it is an amazing story.
[3:07:42.080 --> 3:07:43.560]  My guest is Todd Angle.
[3:07:43.560 --> 3:07:45.640]  He spent four and a half years in prison.
[3:07:45.640 --> 3:07:50.240]  And today we're going to learn how entrapment works, how they infiltrate the fake MAGA hats,
[3:07:50.240 --> 3:07:55.560]  the buddy system, the jean shorts, the perfect short FBI haircuts, and the matching sunglasses.
[3:07:55.560 --> 3:07:56.560]  Give me a break.
[3:07:56.560 --> 3:07:58.120]  Anyway, they think they look good.
[3:07:58.120 --> 3:08:00.800]  They think they look like one of us, isn't that sweet?
[3:08:00.800 --> 3:08:04.920]  But today we're going to learn how this works and we're going to learn what they do most
[3:08:04.920 --> 3:08:09.320]  importantly so that you are on your guard, so that you know what to look for.
[3:08:09.320 --> 3:08:13.520]  This is a very, very important hour and I really do hope you stay tuned because we are
[3:08:13.520 --> 3:08:18.840]  all subject to this because you love this country and the communists don't.
[3:08:18.840 --> 3:08:20.640]  So yeah, they're destroying the economy.
[3:08:20.640 --> 3:08:24.480]  And yes, that is a very big deal to our daily life.
[3:08:24.480 --> 3:08:28.920]  But Todd Angle's story, you need to listen up to this because he's going to show you
[3:08:28.920 --> 3:08:32.560]  exactly what they did to him and how they did it most importantly.
[3:08:32.560 --> 3:08:33.560]  Welcome to the show, Todd.
[3:08:33.560 --> 3:08:34.560]  How are you?
[3:08:34.560 --> 3:08:35.560]  Good.
[3:08:35.560 --> 3:08:36.560]  Good.
[3:08:36.560 --> 3:08:37.560]  Thanks for having me, Kate.
[3:08:37.560 --> 3:08:40.680]  Todd, tell us a little bit about your story.
[3:08:40.680 --> 3:08:46.640]  So in 2014, I saw an incident occurring down in Nevada, so I drove down.
[3:08:46.640 --> 3:08:49.520]  It's infamously known as the Bundy Ranch.
[3:08:49.520 --> 3:08:53.480]  And I was there for about an hour and a half on the bridge.
[3:08:53.480 --> 3:08:58.680]  And I worked with law enforcement to assist in hopefully getting that thing to end peacefully.
[3:08:58.680 --> 3:08:59.880]  And it did.
[3:08:59.880 --> 3:09:08.160]  And then after that, I returned home and was immediately infiltrated by federal agents
[3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:10.040]  and informants.
[3:09:10.040 --> 3:09:14.600]  Some of them I could see and you could tell because they were trying to get you to do
[3:09:14.600 --> 3:09:18.800]  things that were illegal and you immediately knew, okay, this guy, you know, I just need
[3:09:18.800 --> 3:09:20.280]  to get away from this guy.
[3:09:20.280 --> 3:09:22.880]  But many of them you can't.
[3:09:22.880 --> 3:09:26.200]  And I know a lot more about this now than I did then.
[3:09:26.200 --> 3:09:32.320]  And what occurs is when the DOJ and the FBI deem you to be a target, they don't send one
[3:09:32.320 --> 3:09:37.400]  or two confidential human sources or agents into your area.
[3:09:37.400 --> 3:09:39.320]  They flood the zone.
[3:09:39.320 --> 3:09:41.120]  They flood your church.
[3:09:41.120 --> 3:09:43.080]  They flood your gym.
[3:09:43.080 --> 3:09:48.000]  If you go, if you have any patterns, though, if you go to a bar, they'll flood the bar.
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:52.480]  If you are a part of the VFW, they flood the VFW.
[3:09:52.480 --> 3:09:56.760]  They put in so many agents and they're always attempting to bump into you and become your
[3:09:56.760 --> 3:09:57.760]  friend.
[3:09:57.760 --> 3:10:02.960]  And it's very difficult to see them coming from every angle.
[3:10:02.960 --> 3:10:05.080]  Oh, I bet.
[3:10:05.080 --> 3:10:06.760]  I can only imagine.
[3:10:06.760 --> 3:10:12.160]  So tell us what you, what were the charges that you were actually incarcerated for?
[3:10:12.160 --> 3:10:16.940]  I think this is just, listen up, because we all know the January 6th charges.
[3:10:16.940 --> 3:10:19.160]  There were no charges for guns.
[3:10:19.160 --> 3:10:21.120]  Like they said, it was an armed insurrection.
[3:10:21.120 --> 3:10:24.400]  There were no charges really for guns that stuck.
[3:10:24.400 --> 3:10:28.040]  Even if they did a couple of people, they still didn't stick because nobody had a weapon.
[3:10:28.040 --> 3:10:31.840]  It was only trespassing, but that never, of course, made it to fake media.
[3:10:31.840 --> 3:10:34.680]  So tell us what your charges were.
[3:10:34.680 --> 3:10:37.600]  So I was charged with 11 charges in total.
[3:10:37.600 --> 3:10:43.120]  I was convicted of two, one of them being interstate travel and aid of extortion and
[3:10:43.120 --> 3:10:45.160]  the other was obstruction of justice.
[3:10:45.160 --> 3:10:50.800]  And neither one of those should have ever even been charged, but they were, they throw
[3:10:50.800 --> 3:10:53.520]  everything at the wall and hope something sticks.
[3:10:53.520 --> 3:11:02.440]  So ultimately, it was an incredibly corrupt trial, terribly corrupt, and the Ninth Circuit
[3:11:02.440 --> 3:11:06.360]  ultimately overturned the jury's convictions.
[3:11:06.360 --> 3:11:07.720]  And you, and you were freed.
[3:11:07.720 --> 3:11:08.720]  Thank goodness.
[3:11:08.720 --> 3:11:09.960]  I, we worried about you.
[3:11:09.960 --> 3:11:10.960]  We thought about you.
[3:11:10.960 --> 3:11:15.320]  We talked about you for so long, and we were so worried about you in there.
[3:11:15.320 --> 3:11:18.440]  And let me just tell you, four and a half years, I don't know how many people could
[3:11:18.440 --> 3:11:21.960]  stomach that knowing that it was a total sham.
[3:11:21.960 --> 3:11:26.000]  But what's interesting is, is it was an aid of extortion.
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:27.960]  Who were you aiding supposedly?
[3:11:27.960 --> 3:11:32.120]  What were you, what, what, what was that charge about?
[3:11:32.120 --> 3:11:36.240]  It's interesting because I, they say because I left the state and went to another state.
[3:11:36.240 --> 3:11:41.320]  So interstate travel and aid of extortion, but nobody else was convicted of extortion
[3:11:41.320 --> 3:11:43.080]  that I could have aided.
[3:11:43.080 --> 3:11:48.880]  So they, they tried to put forth that I had been responsible for the cattle being released.
[3:11:48.880 --> 3:11:57.720]  And in the extortion, they ultimately fined me $1.65 million because me personally, I
[3:11:57.720 --> 3:12:03.520]  was responsible for the entirety of, of the cattle gather gone wrong.
[3:12:03.520 --> 3:12:08.440]  So yeah, they tried to get me for $1.6 plus million.
[3:12:08.440 --> 3:12:10.240]  Wow.
[3:12:10.240 --> 3:12:14.280]  And I remember the tapes because they were sitting there armed to the teeth, really proud
[3:12:14.280 --> 3:12:15.280]  of it.
[3:12:15.280 --> 3:12:19.920]  Got their macho card, the mall cop card on and acting like they were just going to start
[3:12:19.920 --> 3:12:22.680]  shooting at you guys because you deserved it.
[3:12:22.680 --> 3:12:26.660]  And all there was, was people with flags on horseback.
[3:12:26.660 --> 3:12:29.720]  People were armed, but they were legally even armed.
[3:12:29.720 --> 3:12:33.680]  I mean, I hate that because I think that's an infringement on our second amendment.
[3:12:33.680 --> 3:12:39.800]  But still, you're allowed to carry arms, but they made that the issue.
[3:12:39.800 --> 3:12:44.040]  And what's interesting too is they can throw women to the ground, they could get away with
[3:12:44.040 --> 3:12:45.400]  anything they wanted to do.
[3:12:45.400 --> 3:12:51.200]  And there were, there was a lot of it in formats that had infiltrated and they don't, they
[3:12:51.200 --> 3:12:54.360]  don't get anything done to them, right?
[3:12:54.360 --> 3:12:58.320]  Except you get bogus charges and you do half a year's worth of time.
[3:12:58.320 --> 3:13:01.600]  Nothing ever usually happens to them.
[3:13:01.600 --> 3:13:07.360]  But what people don't understand is that according to the government's own attorney that testified
[3:13:07.360 --> 3:13:12.800]  in all three trials, is that Clive and Bundy did not own, oh, $1.3 million.
[3:13:12.800 --> 3:13:16.400]  He owed $8,810.
[3:13:16.400 --> 3:13:20.640]  And for that, they convened and deployed an entire army.
[3:13:20.640 --> 3:13:27.320]  And two nights in a row, they surrounded his home with sniper teams prior to any protesters
[3:13:27.320 --> 3:13:29.320]  even arriving to the ranch.
[3:13:29.320 --> 3:13:35.120]  So why would you surround a man's home with sniper teams in the middle of the night if
[3:13:35.120 --> 3:13:38.800]  you did not have nefarious and sinister intent?
[3:13:38.800 --> 3:13:39.800]  Yes.
[3:13:39.800 --> 3:13:44.680]  And if you don't believe Todd, just realize that they never went after the amount of money
[3:13:44.680 --> 3:13:48.680]  that was paraded around in the press because they knew it was bogus.
[3:13:48.680 --> 3:13:49.960]  They knew they couldn't get it.
[3:13:49.960 --> 3:13:52.460]  And you're right, it was $8,800.
[3:13:52.460 --> 3:13:56.180]  And so that matter could have been taken up civilly, but they wanted a little war.
[3:13:56.180 --> 3:13:59.200]  They wanted to, to take that family down.
[3:13:59.200 --> 3:14:04.600]  And it was, it was the most horrendous thing I've ever, well, I've seen the FBI do because
[3:14:04.600 --> 3:14:07.520]  I'm closer to the situation where I, where I am.
[3:14:07.520 --> 3:14:11.560]  But the problem is we just had January 6th to, and this is why I desperately wanted to
[3:14:11.560 --> 3:14:18.500]  do this show is because we need to arm people with what to look for, what to be aware of.
[3:14:18.500 --> 3:14:22.440]  Because these people that work for the DOD, that work for the FBI are relentless.
[3:14:22.440 --> 3:14:25.440]  Look what just happened in the Gretchen Whitmer case.
[3:14:25.440 --> 3:14:28.840]  No one wants to be around that woman for five seconds, let alone kidnapper.
[3:14:28.840 --> 3:14:30.840]  Give me a break.
[3:14:30.840 --> 3:14:35.880]  And then they, they come up with this entire ruse and they get nailed sort of in court.
[3:14:35.880 --> 3:14:39.000]  They also got nailed in your situation, you're free today.
[3:14:39.000 --> 3:14:43.960]  They also got nailed in the Bundy situation because they proved that they were corrupt
[3:14:43.960 --> 3:14:46.320]  in all these charges and doing these things.
[3:14:46.320 --> 3:14:49.160]  And so, so it has backfired on them.
[3:14:49.160 --> 3:14:50.840]  It doesn't always work for them.
[3:14:50.840 --> 3:14:54.640]  And I want to know, and I know we only have about a minute left, we're going to go to
[3:14:54.640 --> 3:14:59.360]  a break, but we're going to come back because I want to talk about what's so important.
[3:14:59.360 --> 3:15:01.600]  How did that infiltration work?
[3:15:01.600 --> 3:15:02.760]  What to look for?
[3:15:02.760 --> 3:15:04.280]  What did you notice?
[3:15:04.280 --> 3:15:09.720]  What did you not notice more importantly about the people that were buddying up to you?
[3:15:09.720 --> 3:15:10.960]  Because that's what these people do.
[3:15:10.960 --> 3:15:15.560]  They infiltrate these groups, they buddy up, they try to, they try to act like your best
[3:15:15.560 --> 3:15:19.200]  friend and they try to act like a saint and then you trust them.
[3:15:19.200 --> 3:15:22.520]  And so it is a natural thing to do to want to trust people.
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:24.800]  I get it because we have good hearts.
[3:15:24.800 --> 3:15:28.240]  So we always think everybody else has good hearts too.
[3:15:28.240 --> 3:15:30.000]  And but that's not the case.
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:33.800]  And when you're a true patriot, when you're somebody that loves this country, you do have
[3:15:33.800 --> 3:15:37.760]  a target on your back and we have to be very, very, very careful.
[3:15:37.760 --> 3:15:40.560]  So I'm going to come right back more with Todd Angle when we come back.
[3:15:40.560 --> 3:15:44.320]  I'm so glad he's out now and has beat this.
[3:15:44.320 --> 3:15:45.880]  And we'll be right back.
[3:15:45.880 --> 3:15:56.360]  Of course, I'm Kate Daly, your guest host on the Alex Jones show.

[3:17:04.220 --> 3:17:12.520]  As the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.

[3:19:57.320 --> 3:20:04.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:10.320 --> 3:20:16.320]  Hi, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Kay Dally, your guest host. So glad to be here today. So glad to be with you today.
[3:20:16.320 --> 3:20:23.320]  And let me just tell you, as a talk show host, I am neither mental nor near a mental break nor suicidal.
[3:20:23.320 --> 3:20:32.320]  And I know that I swear I feel like I have to say that daily because we know what's ahead of us and we know how they're going to operate.
[3:20:32.320 --> 3:20:43.320]  Is that a good word? Operate? OK. Todd Engel is my guest. He spent four and a half years in prison. Can you imagine spending four and a half years in prison and you didn't do anything?
[3:20:43.320 --> 3:20:51.320]  Really and truly, you didn't harm anyone. There wasn't anything there. There was no there there. Let's put it that way.
[3:20:51.320 --> 3:21:02.320]  And so when this all started, what did you notice? Why were you the target, Todd? Why you?
[3:21:02.320 --> 3:21:18.320]  One of the main reasons is because I went and was willing to stand against an extreme overreach by the federal government to the point of standing in the gap and willing to do as our founders did at Concord and Lexington.
[3:21:18.320 --> 3:21:26.320]  We were not going to back down and they knew it and ultimately they had to back down. So that put a huge target on my chest.
[3:21:26.320 --> 3:21:36.320]  And then ultimately I came back and where I live in northern Idaho is one of the main targets in the United States for the feds to infiltrate.
[3:21:36.320 --> 3:21:44.320]  Because they say as we well know that North Idaho is ungovernable. We are very liberty minded and independent up here.
[3:21:44.320 --> 3:21:56.320]  And they did not like the fact that I was down there and that I lived up here and that I was involved in, at that time I was actually involved in the oath keepers.
[3:21:56.320 --> 3:22:13.320]  Unfortunately at this point, I know a lot. And then we do a lot of shooting and we're active in the Patriot community up here and they just wanted to pound the tallest nail down in North Idaho.
[3:22:13.320 --> 3:22:24.320]  Jeez. And so you were in, so leading up to this, what did, or let's just say right after this because that's really when you became the target.
[3:22:24.320 --> 3:22:33.320]  So right after this, what did you start to notice? Like you said, bumping into people at the gym, people suddenly around you wanting to be your best friend, right?
[3:22:33.320 --> 3:22:44.320]  Yeah, so the gym, they infiltrate you at the gym by, if you're in the hot tub, they come in and they overhear the conversation and then they enter into the conversation and strike it up.
[3:22:44.320 --> 3:22:54.320]  And they're usually everything that you are. That's the key to this. If you like to shoot, they like to shoot. If you like to ride motorcycles, they like to ride motorcycles.
[3:22:54.320 --> 3:23:05.320]  So they know everything about you. So then they send in sources and agents that are exactly like you that you're going to get along with really well.
[3:23:05.320 --> 3:23:12.320]  Up to and including, I go to church, you go to church. I hunt elk, you hunt elk.
[3:23:12.320 --> 3:23:18.320]  So you want to be friends with this guy because you don't meet a whole lot of guys that enjoy all of the same things that you do.
[3:23:18.320 --> 3:23:24.320]  So you obviously are going to invite them into your world and go riding motorcycles and shoot guns and hunt elk.
[3:23:24.320 --> 3:23:30.320]  And little do you know, he works for the federal government.
[3:23:30.320 --> 3:23:42.320]  It's amazing. And I know there's, you know, it came out, I think a couple of years ago, that the DOD was spinning out just what several million civilian types that were working for them.
[3:23:42.320 --> 3:23:48.320]  And in basic jobs, you know, just kind of just one of you, you know, all of a sudden they start showing up to everything.
[3:23:48.320 --> 3:23:52.320]  So was that we're the same people then? Like were they trying to make plans with you?
[3:23:52.320 --> 3:23:56.320]  Were they showing up to the same sort of meetings with other patriots?
[3:23:56.320 --> 3:24:01.320]  And when I say patriots, I'm talking about people that just love their country. We're not talking about violence.
[3:24:01.320 --> 3:24:05.320]  We're not talking about hatching plans. We're not talking about anything like that.
[3:24:05.320 --> 3:24:11.320]  We're just talking about people who deeply care about their country being demolished right now.
[3:24:11.320 --> 3:24:24.320]  And so these, these CADs, these people that are traders to their own country will go and infiltrate these groups so that they can provide information to like the FBI DOD, right?
[3:24:24.320 --> 3:24:33.320]  Correct. And they show up at political rallies. If you support a candidate, they support the same candidate.
[3:24:33.320 --> 3:24:42.320]  And obviously, they're reporting back on you. You do not know it because they're not doing anything to you to get you to break a law.
[3:24:42.320 --> 3:24:53.320]  Like what we see with the Gretchen Whitmer case, that was, you could have seen that for a mile away when they're instigating crimes and they're hinting at crimes.
[3:24:53.320 --> 3:25:01.320]  I had that happen to me. There were guys that wanted to, you know, get me to do illegal things and I just eradicated them out of my life.
[3:25:01.320 --> 3:25:11.320]  They also, the FBI also sent two beautiful young women at me at different times to try to get me to, I don't know, take them home or whatever.
[3:25:11.320 --> 3:25:19.320]  And I actually, you know, I was sitting at a hamburger stand and I actually looked over at the one, the one day and I said, you must be with the FBI.
[3:25:19.320 --> 3:25:23.320]  I'm an old fart and you're 25 years old and gorgeous. So get lost.
[3:25:23.320 --> 3:25:29.320]  And two days later, they did it again. And then I said, you're with the FBI. Just get away from me.
[3:25:29.320 --> 3:25:35.320]  So I was able to see them. You could see some of them from a mile away.
[3:25:35.320 --> 3:25:41.320]  But the ones that go to your church and they're just the nicest people in the world and they're not trying to get you to do anything illegal.
[3:25:41.320 --> 3:25:48.320]  Those you just cannot tell at all. You just can't see them coming.
[3:25:48.320 --> 3:25:54.320]  Right. In your case, you became friends with a couple of them, correct? Really good friends.
[3:25:54.320 --> 3:26:00.320]  Yes, I did. One of them, I became such good friends, we actually started a company together.
[3:26:00.320 --> 3:26:07.320]  And through that, we just were super, super tight. He was the nicest guy, a good Christian man.
[3:26:07.320 --> 3:26:11.320]  He had some kids that he had adopted. He was just a good dude.
[3:26:11.320 --> 3:26:19.320]  And I also met another one that was, you know, just like me, he was a shooter and a hunter and he had all the same interests in common.
[3:26:19.320 --> 3:26:33.320]  So we, you know, us three did a lot of things together and they never, there was no hint that they were with the FBI or informants until after I was released.
[3:26:33.320 --> 3:26:36.320]  And then I found out a whole lot more.
[3:26:36.320 --> 3:26:51.320]  Ooh, ouch. And then suddenly a lot of your stuff is missing. A lot of the things you can't get back after you're out. So to add insult to injury, you have had to face so much since you've gotten out.
[3:26:51.320 --> 3:26:55.320]  I mean, it's been very difficult. All your stuff's gone.
[3:26:55.320 --> 3:26:58.320]  Yes. Yeah, it's very difficult.
[3:26:58.320 --> 3:27:11.320]  The one guy that I knew his name is John. He went to my home after my arrest to secure all of my property for me.
[3:27:11.320 --> 3:27:21.320]  And he was there within hours after my arrest and took all of my property over to Montana and stored it.
[3:27:21.320 --> 3:27:36.320]  But we were attempting to get it back from him for months and years and he always had excuses as to why he wasn't going to give me my property back because he wanted to make sure that I had everything that I owned still when I was released.
[3:27:36.320 --> 3:27:39.320]  He wanted to give it all back to me when I was released.
[3:27:39.320 --> 3:27:51.320]  And so obviously I was released with a surprise because I was supposed to do 14 years and I only did four and a half. So it caught him off guard and he began to panic.
[3:27:51.320 --> 3:28:01.320]  And we learned a lot more about this guy here in the last 18 months since my release and I will go into that here shortly.
[3:28:01.320 --> 3:28:04.320]  And it's a compelling story.
[3:28:04.320 --> 3:28:14.320]  It really is because you realize, I mean, you think you can trust them. You don't have a whole lot of people that are in a position to, you know, think about it, everybody.
[3:28:14.320 --> 3:28:18.320]  If you were incarcerated immediately, who would you trust with yourself? What would you do?
[3:28:18.320 --> 3:28:23.320]  And I just can't imagine being put in that situation.
[3:28:23.320 --> 3:28:31.320]  But then you're right. When you start to find out who this person really is, what they're behind, and then you start to see the whole picture.
[3:28:31.320 --> 3:28:34.320]  I'm sure that was really, it's discouraging.
[3:28:34.320 --> 3:28:36.320]  But I want to come back. Let's explain that when we come back.
[3:28:36.320 --> 3:28:43.320]  My guest is Todd Engel. He did four and a half years on Trumped Up Charges and it was just despicable what they did to him.
[3:28:43.320 --> 3:28:46.320]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host from KateDalyRadio.com.
[3:28:46.320 --> 3:29:02.320]  On the Alex Jones Show, we will be right back.
[3:29:17.320 --> 3:29:22.320]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their main move.
[3:29:22.320 --> 3:29:28.320]  In full wars, it's paradoxical. It's more popular than ever. It's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[3:29:28.320 --> 3:29:36.320]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.

[3:31:55.320 --> 3:32:05.320]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand info wars. I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[3:32:05.320 --> 3:32:18.320]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge the globalist. And it was a t-shirt I designed the first one, Mass Murderers Agreed Gun Control Works, that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew.
[3:32:18.320 --> 3:32:27.320]  That's our oldest design and we're still selling. We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions because whatever stock we've got in, that's it.
[3:32:27.320 --> 3:32:33.320]  We're selling everything out to fund the operation to get rid of inventory. We'll still have some teachers in the future.
[3:32:33.320 --> 3:32:39.320]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs. So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.

[3:33:10.320 --> 3:33:15.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Daly, your guest host from KateDalyRadio.com.
[3:33:15.320 --> 3:33:21.320]  I'm so glad to be with you because I have such a great guest with me and I've been wanting to talk to him for years.
[3:33:21.320 --> 3:33:31.320]  He was incarcerated for four and a half years on trumped up charges, FBI entrapment. They're really good at entrapping and they have really perfected the skill.
[3:33:31.320 --> 3:33:42.320]  Although I have to say, looking back at the pictures from the reunion of January 6th, the same kind of event that they infiltrated them, the jean shorts and the matching sunglasses and everything really gave them away.
[3:33:42.320 --> 3:33:53.320]  They might want to up their game a little bit. So when talking about this, you know, I was on the air yesterday talking about the Nigerians and how cell phone service was cut out for 73 million people.
[3:33:53.320 --> 3:34:03.320]  They're going to do a lot of things to make our lives difficult. Okay, we've got an economy that is going through the roof right now because of King Fraudalot and Hormala at the helm.
[3:34:03.320 --> 3:34:11.320]  We know they're not really at the helm. They're just a puppetry. But they are, what we have is an economy imploding.
[3:34:11.320 --> 3:34:21.320]  We have people getting more angry and as people get more angry, patriot groups are the focus and they want to come in and they want to see who's doing what all over the country.
[3:34:21.320 --> 3:34:26.320]  You know, what's going on? It's kind of like what we used to say in my family, like checking the weather, you know what I mean?
[3:34:26.320 --> 3:34:31.320]  I just want to make sure what's going on and who's who and everything else, what groups are doing.
[3:34:31.320 --> 3:34:38.320]  So you have to keep that in mind because as people get more awake and more angry, you have more infiltration.
[3:34:38.320 --> 3:34:49.320]  And so I'm not talking about being paranoid. I'm talking about looking for the signs of those people that infiltrate where you think something's off about their story, the reasons they're there.
[3:34:49.320 --> 3:34:57.320]  All of a sudden they have this huge interest in politics that they didn't have before. There's so many different things that we should be looking at.
[3:34:57.320 --> 3:35:07.320]  My guest has taught Angle. So let's go a little deeper with this. So you became friends with this gentleman. All of a sudden he had all of your things while you were incarcerated.
[3:35:07.320 --> 3:35:15.320]  Yes, that's correct. And then when I was released, I attempted to get everything back and we are talking all of my vehicles.
[3:35:15.320 --> 3:35:27.320]  We are talking about 30 plus guns, tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, just about everything that I owned of any value.
[3:35:27.320 --> 3:35:41.320]  And he also was and is in possession of an ATF controlled item, which is a suppressor, something that I own legally, but is not in my possession anymore is in his possession.
[3:35:41.320 --> 3:35:53.320]  And he is in illegal possession of that weapon. Now, my investigators sent a 17 page complaint to the Office of Inspector General this time last year.
[3:35:53.320 --> 3:36:06.320]  They felt that it was worthy to send it to the FBI and to the DOJ. The FBI and the DOJ sent us back.
[3:36:06.320 --> 3:36:13.320]  Go pound sand letters. This guy, we don't care what he's done and we're not going to do anything about it.
[3:36:13.320 --> 3:36:29.320]  We know now that he is an actual, at minimum a confidential human source, if not an agent of the FBI. It looks very, very likely that he is a federal agent.
[3:36:29.320 --> 3:36:41.320]  He has since my arrest and he, him taking possession, stealing everything that I owned, he has been selling my weapons on the streets of America.
[3:36:41.320 --> 3:36:46.320]  These are stolen rifles, stolen handguns.
[3:36:46.320 --> 3:36:59.320]  This has a ring of fast and furious where this man is out there as a federal agent, gone rogue, I don't know, but we do know that the FBI knows that he is doing this.
[3:36:59.320 --> 3:37:10.320]  We've reported this to them from every angle we possibly could. We did not want to go public with this. We wanted them to make this right with us, but they wouldn't.
[3:37:10.320 --> 3:37:16.320]  At every opportunity, they would not make this right with me. So we are sitting here with you now, Kate.
[3:37:16.320 --> 3:37:28.320]  And this man is literally selling high powered rifles, AR-15s, AR-10s, HK-91s on the streets of America.
[3:37:28.320 --> 3:37:44.320]  A federal agent stole 30 guns and is selling stolen guns on the streets of America right now as we speak. And the FBI knows it and they have consented to it.
[3:37:44.320 --> 3:37:51.320]  I'm speechless. I'm speechless because how many times have they done this?
[3:37:51.320 --> 3:37:59.320]  This is the one time they're getting called out on doing this, but you know that there's so much more to this that they've done in the past.
[3:37:59.320 --> 3:38:06.320]  So many people are sitting in prison right now on trumped up charges. There's stuff taken from them. They never get it back.
[3:38:06.320 --> 3:38:12.320]  I don't even know if the Finnecom family got back the vehicle that they took from them.
[3:38:12.320 --> 3:38:22.320]  It has been amazing to watch things unfold over the years and no justice, zero justice when they do something to us as citizens.
[3:38:22.320 --> 3:38:31.320]  Where is the justice? And so I can't imagine how you've gotten through this, Todd. I really don't know how you got through four and a half years.
[3:38:31.320 --> 3:38:35.320]  How did you do that mentally? What did you do to get through that?
[3:38:35.320 --> 3:38:45.320]  Kate, I'm just a strong believer in my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and he got me through some of the most horrific events that you can ever imagine.
[3:38:45.320 --> 3:38:52.320]  But he got me through it with flying colors. I read the Bible a lot while I was in there and I understood it from a different perspective.
[3:38:52.320 --> 3:38:57.320]  The Apostle Paul, he spent time in prison, Daniel, Joseph.
[3:38:57.320 --> 3:39:10.320]  So when you have a good faith, you can get through these horrible times and the Lord got me through it and by the grace of God, I'm here with you right now instead of still sitting in a prison.
[3:39:10.320 --> 3:39:21.320]  Yeah, because you came dangerously close to that and I can't believe 14 years for going across state lines in this here United States of America.
[3:39:21.320 --> 3:39:24.320]  And what was the other one? What was the other charge?
[3:39:24.320 --> 3:39:28.320]  Obstruction of justice and interstate travel and aid of extortion.
[3:39:28.320 --> 3:39:38.320]  Obstruction of justice. That's what they tried to pin on those January 6th people who were just waved into the Capitol when that had, you know, you couldn't open that very, very heavy door from the outside.
[3:39:38.320 --> 3:39:46.320]  So they were waved in by policemen and they had to acknowledge there were tapes waving people in, but they did the same thing, obstruction of justice.
[3:39:46.320 --> 3:40:06.320]  So know that they can put that charge on you whenever they feel like it. You know, I can't imagine being a member of the FBI right now or the CIA or the DoD right now because really and truly who are you working for and who are you working against when you go to the situation of entrapment.
[3:40:06.320 --> 3:40:16.320]  When you're in a situation to entrap and inform on people, then haven't you crossed a line as a treasonous to this country? I mean, I would think so.
[3:40:16.320 --> 3:40:22.320]  I would think that that would be the point where you would check yourself and say, what occupation am I in and why am I doing this?
[3:40:22.320 --> 3:40:29.320]  I'm sure you thought a lot about that, about what it means to be an American when you were sitting in prison.
[3:40:29.320 --> 3:40:43.320]  Yes, I did. And I got to think about everything that had occurred for many years. And then when I was released, Kate, it became even more apparent who the FBI has become.
[3:40:43.320 --> 3:40:57.320]  I was told, confidentially, that the FBI wanted to go to my place of residence in the middle of the night with two hostage rescue teams.
[3:40:57.320 --> 3:41:06.320]  There could have been no good outcome for that. They arrested me a few days later with no incident at all, a peaceful arrest.
[3:41:06.320 --> 3:41:14.320]  But a few nights before that, they had two hostage rescue teams ready to go to my high mountain cabin and assault me.
[3:41:14.320 --> 3:41:23.320]  Now, mind you, I live a couple of ridges over from Ruby Ridge. So we were about ready to have a second Ruby Ridge in northern Idaho.
[3:41:23.320 --> 3:41:31.320]  And these guys were gung ho. A friend of mine told me about this because he was in the meeting with the hostage rescue team.
[3:41:31.320 --> 3:41:40.320]  And he shut it down and would not let them go to my cabin and ultimately would have probably killed me up there in the mountains.
[3:41:40.320 --> 3:41:47.320]  So these guys are not like regularly people say to me, well, there's good people in the FBI. Yes, I understand that.
[3:41:47.320 --> 3:41:58.320]  The mafia walks women across the street, they donate to the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts and, you know, they may have some philanthropic things, but they're still the mafia.
[3:41:58.320 --> 3:42:10.320]  The FBI may do some good things, but they're doing bad things, a lot of bad things. And for those FBI agents that are listening to this, you need to have some integrity.
[3:42:10.320 --> 3:42:15.320]  You need to look for a new job, get away from this organization.
[3:42:15.320 --> 3:42:19.320]  Amen. Man, I can't say it better than that.
[3:42:19.320 --> 3:42:26.320]  It renders me speechless because I like you. I'm thinking about these people and I'm thinking, I know they go home at night.
[3:42:26.320 --> 3:42:32.320]  They look themselves in the mirror. They've got to ask themselves, what is my job doing to my country?
[3:42:32.320 --> 3:42:39.320]  Because you know what? They're going to be on the other side of this as well. And they don't realize that.
[3:42:39.320 --> 3:42:46.320]  The more that they ruin this country, they still live here and they are part of this country, too, if they don't think it's going to happen to them, too, at some point.
[3:42:46.320 --> 3:43:14.320]  Be right back, Kate Dolly.

[3:46:57.320 --> 3:47:11.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:11.320 --> 3:47:24.320]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones show, so happy to be here. I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from KateDallyRadio.com. My guest, Todd Engle, who spent time in prison, unfortunately, at the behest of entrapment by our FBI.
[3:47:24.320 --> 3:47:39.320]  And what's interesting about this is when I look at this as a whole, you know, those that run this country that are really running this country, they can't do anything in a small number like that unless they have government employees willing to do their dirty work.
[3:47:39.320 --> 3:47:55.320]  They can't do a thing unless regular Americans who work for them are willing to go in and take patriots that love their country and turn them into something violent in the press, which they're not, or take them down in some way.
[3:47:55.320 --> 3:48:06.320]  And that's what's so sad is, you know, you have Black Lives Matters. That's a violent group. You have a lot of violent groups in America to worry about, but they're coming after those that love this country.
[3:48:06.320 --> 3:48:15.320]  And that's what makes me sick, is that we're the problem. They are selling to America right now. We are the domestic terrorists, right? Because we just love our country.
[3:48:15.320 --> 3:48:23.320]  We're not planning anything violent. There's nothing violent about this. But we want to defend our country from them, but we don't know what to do about that.
[3:48:23.320 --> 3:48:32.320]  And so we meet often, and they love to infiltrate these groups, our groups, and try to see what we're up to, what we're doing. We're not doing anything.
[3:48:32.320 --> 3:48:43.320]  We're talking about our love for our country, but they want to turn it into something else. And that's why they have to use techniques like entrapment against their own fellow citizens, which is quite abhorrent and disgusting.
[3:48:43.320 --> 3:48:55.320]  But Todd, what other evidence did you have that this guy that buddied up to you took all your stuff, selling your stuff, was FBI?
[3:48:55.320 --> 3:49:09.320]  So when I was released, a co-defendant of mine came to me and said, when I was looking through the discovery, I found what's called an FD1023.
[3:49:09.320 --> 3:49:18.320]  It is a report written by an FBI agent who is actually interviewing a witness or source or another agent that has information.
[3:49:18.320 --> 3:49:30.320]  And he said that these FD1023s ended up in his discovery. Well, these FD1023s described a conversation with my co-defendant and John Anderson.
[3:49:30.320 --> 3:49:42.320]  So John Anderson turning over information to the U.S. Attorney's Office on my co-defendant. So that was one of the first heads up that we had that he was working with the feds.
[3:49:42.320 --> 3:49:55.320]  The next one was I was contacted by a man that had been put in prison by John Anderson when Anderson was recording everyone of their phone calls for almost two years.
[3:49:55.320 --> 3:50:11.320]  These recordings are in the discovery in this gentleman's case, but this case has been sealed so we can't get the recordings out of from the U.S. Attorney's Office because they don't want us to have this information on John Anderson.
[3:50:11.320 --> 3:50:17.320]  We do have a clip of this we could play, I believe.
[3:50:17.320 --> 3:50:26.320]  Yeah, you have a clip of John Anderson and myself on the phone when he makes a pretty interesting statement.
[3:50:26.320 --> 3:50:31.320]  Yeah.
[3:50:31.320 --> 3:50:39.320]  It might not play. And so he actually admits that he was with the government.
[3:50:39.320 --> 3:50:43.320]  Let me see if I have it here, Kate. Right here. Can you hear it?
[3:50:43.320 --> 3:50:53.320]  No.
[3:50:53.320 --> 3:50:56.320]  He says, you know I work for the government, right?
[3:50:56.320 --> 3:50:59.320]  Yeah, he actually admits it on tape.
[3:50:59.320 --> 3:51:03.320]  I don't know how much more...
[3:51:03.320 --> 3:51:09.320]  So on that note, Kate, he works for the government.
[3:51:09.320 --> 3:51:18.320]  I am in prison. He is not allowed to even talk to me while I'm in prison. I have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
[3:51:18.320 --> 3:51:27.320]  He is an agent with the federal government who's talking to me on the phone violating my constitutional rights every time I talk to him.
[3:51:27.320 --> 3:51:32.320]  He is most definitely barred from having my property at his house.
[3:51:32.320 --> 3:51:43.320]  It would be like I'm arrested and 10 FBI agents go to my house and go, hey, let's take all this stuff home and enjoy his stuff.
[3:51:43.320 --> 3:51:50.320]  And then let's, whatever you don't want, sell it on the streets. And that's what's happened here.
[3:51:50.320 --> 3:51:58.320]  I hope people realize that we are the targets. The people that just love this country are the targets.
[3:51:58.320 --> 3:52:03.320]  You did nothing, Todd. You weren't doing anything. You didn't harm anybody.
[3:52:03.320 --> 3:52:09.320]  There was no plot. You were just running to the aid of other Americans like we all would.
[3:52:09.320 --> 3:52:17.320]  And instead of just being able to do that in this free country, and I say free in quotes, doesn't feel free anymore,
[3:52:17.320 --> 3:52:23.320]  you have all of these people infiltrating, trying to do something to you.
[3:52:23.320 --> 3:52:30.320]  And when they can't get real charges, they get charges that they create.
[3:52:30.320 --> 3:52:35.320]  And the system is so bad that you were actually thrown into prison for four and a half years.
[3:52:35.320 --> 3:52:38.320]  You spent four and a half years. We're not talking a month.
[3:52:38.320 --> 3:52:43.320]  We're talking four and a half years of your life in prison.
[3:52:43.320 --> 3:52:48.320]  And they were able to do it on trumped-up charges.
[3:52:48.320 --> 3:52:55.320]  Those charges are so innocuous. So now what? Now what do you do with that?
[3:52:55.320 --> 3:53:02.320]  Obviously, as you know, I have a civil suit against the federal government for what they've done to me.
[3:53:02.320 --> 3:53:13.320]  But the persecution continues, not just with John Anderson, but I am disallowed still from purchasing a gun.
[3:53:13.320 --> 3:53:19.320]  I actually tried yesterday and I was denied.
[3:53:19.320 --> 3:53:24.320]  I still have not had my property returned to me from the FBI.
[3:53:24.320 --> 3:53:30.320]  Agent Joel Willis is in possession of one of my guns and some other personal property.
[3:53:30.320 --> 3:53:33.320]  And he won't return it to me. And I've been out of prison for 18 months.
[3:53:33.320 --> 3:53:37.320]  I'm totally vindicated. I have no criminal record at all.
[3:53:37.320 --> 3:53:41.320]  But the FBI won't even return my personal property to me.
[3:53:41.320 --> 3:53:44.320]  And they won't answer why they won't return my personal property to me.
[3:53:44.320 --> 3:53:51.320]  So not only has Anderson stolen everything that I owned with the FBI,
[3:53:51.320 --> 3:53:55.320]  but Joel Willis, FBI agent Joel Willis won't return my personal property to me.
[3:53:55.320 --> 3:54:03.320]  So in essence, he's stealing even more of my property as I sit here and won't return it to me.
[3:54:03.320 --> 3:54:06.320]  It just, I really hope people are listening.
[3:54:06.320 --> 3:54:09.320]  I hope people look around and not in a paranoid way.
[3:54:09.320 --> 3:54:13.320]  I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is look around. What doesn't fit?
[3:54:13.320 --> 3:54:20.320]  You know, sometimes you got to listen to that little spirit inside that says something's not right about this person or this situation.
[3:54:20.320 --> 3:54:24.320]  It doesn't make sense. There's little clues, right?
[3:54:24.320 --> 3:54:26.320]  I mean, I have felt naive in the past.
[3:54:26.320 --> 3:54:28.320]  Have you felt naive in the past, Todd?
[3:54:28.320 --> 3:54:31.320]  Like you didn't pick up on it and you should have.
[3:54:31.320 --> 3:54:35.320]  What would you tell people to look for in these situations too?
[3:54:35.320 --> 3:54:40.320]  So what you're going to look for, if you become a target to the DOJ or the FBI,
[3:54:40.320 --> 3:54:45.320]  you are going to want to watch out for the person that just moves to your area.
[3:54:45.320 --> 3:54:49.320]  He's going to be brand new to your area, he or she.
[3:54:49.320 --> 3:54:53.320]  They're going to come in and like I said, they're going to be everything that you want them to be.
[3:54:53.320 --> 3:55:04.320]  And they are going to, they are going to infiltrate you from every angle that you can ever imagine.
[3:55:04.320 --> 3:55:07.320]  They have every bit of information on you.
[3:55:07.320 --> 3:55:12.320]  They will come at you at your weakest points.
[3:55:12.320 --> 3:55:19.320]  Be on lookout for, I am a strong supporter of the military.
[3:55:19.320 --> 3:55:22.320]  I love these guys.
[3:55:22.320 --> 3:55:30.320]  But the majority of the infiltrators and the agents that came at me were former military.
[3:55:30.320 --> 3:55:37.320]  Unfortunately, Stuart Rhodes is the one that introduced me to these two gentlemen that robbed me.
[3:55:37.320 --> 3:55:40.320]  And I was very good friends with Stuart Rhodes.
[3:55:40.320 --> 3:55:43.320]  He's former military, obviously.
[3:55:43.320 --> 3:55:53.320]  And I've lost a lot of faith in a lot of these guys that show up into my world and are former military.
[3:55:53.320 --> 3:55:54.320]  I love these guys.
[3:55:54.320 --> 3:55:57.320]  So I obviously had a big heart for these guys.
[3:55:57.320 --> 3:56:00.320]  I trusted them, they've been through a lot.
[3:56:00.320 --> 3:56:03.320]  So it really tugged on my heart strings.
[3:56:03.320 --> 3:56:05.320]  I wanted to do everything I could to help these guys.
[3:56:05.320 --> 3:56:09.320]  That's why I would give them jobs and employ them.
[3:56:09.320 --> 3:56:16.320]  And unfortunately, their heart is much more towards working with the FBI.
[3:56:16.320 --> 3:56:23.320]  A lot of these guys, unfortunately, and it's really broken my heart to know that a lot of these people that did these things to me are former military.
[3:56:23.320 --> 3:56:26.320]  It just really breaks my heart.
[3:56:26.320 --> 3:56:27.320]  Sure.
[3:56:27.320 --> 3:56:30.320]  I would say don't bring your cell phone to an event.
[3:56:30.320 --> 3:56:33.320]  I would say because they can grab all that information.
[3:56:33.320 --> 3:56:40.320]  I would say be very careful about all the events you go to and who your new friends are.
[3:56:40.320 --> 3:56:43.320]  I think you're running for office, which I'm really happy to see that.
[3:56:43.320 --> 3:56:47.320]  We need people that understand how broken our system is.
[3:56:47.320 --> 3:56:49.320]  Boy, it sounds like a politician statement.
[3:56:49.320 --> 3:56:53.320]  How broken the system is with our justice system and it is pathetic.
[3:56:53.320 --> 3:56:57.320]  And so I'm really glad that people like you, you are running for office.
[3:56:57.320 --> 3:57:05.320]  And in Idaho, I sure hope that you get far with that because you need to because you can be somebody in there that's already been through so much.
[3:57:05.320 --> 3:57:07.320]  But also just be very careful out there, people.
[3:57:07.320 --> 3:57:14.320]  I mean, they really do want to take down the patriots of this country, the people that love this country.
[3:57:14.320 --> 3:57:19.320]  And seeing what they've done to the people January 6th, it just breaks my heart.
[3:57:19.320 --> 3:57:21.320]  It just makes me sick.
[3:57:21.320 --> 3:57:24.320]  And so I really appreciate you, Todd, for coming on with me.
[3:57:24.320 --> 3:57:26.320]  Todd Engel, I really appreciate it.
[3:57:26.320 --> 3:57:28.320]  Thank you for telling us your story.
[3:57:28.320 --> 3:57:32.320]  I know it's not easy because you put your own self in danger and I thank you for that.
[3:57:32.320 --> 3:57:34.320]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host for the Alex Jones show.
[3:57:34.320 --> 3:57:36.320]  I sure appreciate your time in this hour.
[3:57:36.320 --> 3:57:38.320]  What an important message from Todd.
[3:57:38.320 --> 3:57:40.320]  Thank you.
[3:57:45.320 --> 3:57:47.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[3:57:47.320 --> 3:57:51.320]  I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong.
[3:57:51.320 --> 3:57:55.320]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[3:57:55.320 --> 3:57:56.320]  I was born for this.
[3:57:56.320 --> 3:57:57.320]  You were born for this.
[3:57:57.320 --> 3:58:06.320]  And people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[3:58:06.320 --> 3:58:18.320]  And now with Band-Aid video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[3:58:18.320 --> 3:58:22.320]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[3:58:22.320 --> 3:58:28.320]  Info wars and Band-Aid video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[3:58:28.320 --> 3:58:35.320]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[3:58:35.320 --> 3:58:38.320]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now.
[3:58:38.320 --> 3:59:06.320]  The mega emergency blowout sale of the 75% off getting credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever.
[3:59:06.320 --> 3:59:08.320]  I'm so glad you called elaborate on this.
[3:59:08.320 --> 3:59:09.320]  Yes.
[3:59:09.320 --> 3:59:17.320]  Now is the time in your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on your car or banner hangs over highways.
[3:59:17.320 --> 3:59:19.320]  And it will be a chain reaction.
[3:59:19.320 --> 3:59:21.320]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[3:59:21.320 --> 3:59:22.320]  I have a few ideas.
[3:59:22.320 --> 3:59:24.320]  First of all, help just as much as you can.
[3:59:24.320 --> 3:59:25.320]  Don't farm.
[3:59:25.320 --> 3:59:26.320]  Arrest out.
[3:59:26.320 --> 3:59:27.320]  Arrest about 12.
[3:59:27.320 --> 3:59:28.320]  The vaccine is poison.
[3:59:28.320 --> 3:59:29.320]  There's tons of things.
[3:59:29.320 --> 3:59:30.320]  I say just keep it short.
[3:59:30.320 --> 3:59:31.320]  Keep it concise.
[3:59:31.320 --> 3:59:32.320]  Don't agree.
[3:59:32.320 --> 3:59:33.320]  Arrest Fauci.
[3:59:33.320 --> 3:59:34.320]  Arrest Bill Gates.
[3:59:34.320 --> 3:59:35.320]  The COVID-vaxx is poison.
[3:59:35.320 --> 3:59:35.320]  Beautiful.
[3:59:35.320 --> 3:59:36.320]  Yeah.
[3:59:36.320 --> 3:59:39.320]  There's ways that we could all be involved if we could all be effective though.
[3:59:39.320 --> 3:59:40.320]  That's what I'm calling about.
[3:59:40.320 --> 3:59:41.320]  God bless you Chris.
[3:59:41.320 --> 3:59:44.320]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[3:59:44.320 --> 4:00:06.320]  Thank you so much.
