[00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:15.498]  Ladies and gentlemen, two years ago, the Hunter laptop was totally confirmed to be real and showed pedophilia, drug dealing, but even more importantly that he was a Chinese-slash-Russian-Ukrainian operative for his father taking payments.
[00:00:15.518 --> 00:00:15.578]  Now...
[00:00:17.228 --> 00:00:19.810]  As of yesterday, it was leaked on 4chan.
[00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.094]  His phone, thousands of videos, text messages, emails, even worse than the first data drop.
[00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:30.637]  This is a seismic moment and the pedophilia is horrible and it's important.
[00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.258]  But that's how they blackmail him and control him.
[00:00:33.598 --> 00:00:41.263]  The issue that most people aren't focusing on is the fact that it confirms that he was an agent of Communist China and Chinese intelligence.
[00:00:42.484 --> 00:00:45.086]  Biden should be removed today, but they won't do that.
[00:00:46.391 --> 00:00:49.372]  They'll assassinate him or say he had a stroke and that's how they'll do it.
[00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:58.816]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:58.735 --> 00:01:00.735]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:10.135]  It's Monday.
[00:01:10.135 --> 00:01:12.135]  [applause]
[00:01:12.135 --> 00:01:14.135]  [inaudible]
[00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:16.135]  [inaudible]
[00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:18.135]  [applause]
[00:01:18.135 --> 00:01:20.135]  [inaudible]
[00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:20.964]  InfoWars.
[00:01:21.324 --> 00:01:22.206]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:01:22.307 --> 00:01:29.307]  today.
[00:01:29.307 --> 00:01:51.466]   A year and a half ago Sri Lanka put the exact same UN global government rules on carbon over cattle,
[00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:55.986]   over nitrogen over farming that we now see being put in place in Europe
[00:01:55.986 --> 00:01:59.546]   and the giant protest erupting in the Netherlands, France, Germany and other
[00:01:59.546 --> 00:02:00.026]  countries.
[00:02:00.026 --> 00:02:10.026]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:10.067]  The shutdown of their way of life, the literal starvation, and an open plan to force farmers to sell their property to mega-ag corporations.
[00:02:10.147 --> 00:02:11.848]  This is a criminal takeover.
[00:02:12.853 --> 00:02:13.993]  Welcome to the Great Reset.
[00:02:15.154 --> 00:02:22.797]  Now, the globalists have bit off more than they can chew, they push too hard, and the whole world's waking up to them right now.
[00:02:23.157 --> 00:02:27.739]  So you'd ask, why don't they back off the shutdown and collapse of society?
[00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:32.501]  Because they've already triggered it, and they think they're going to ride this tiger.
[00:02:33.626 --> 00:02:48.764]  But all over Latin America, all over Asia, all over the Pacific, all over Europe, all over Eastern Europe, there are massive riots and government building takeovers by individuals saying, death to the New World Order, down with Bill Gates.
[00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:50.870]  Down with Klaus Schwab.
[00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.271]  They're saying it in Sri Lanka.
[00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:55.855]  They're saying it in the Dutch countryside.
[00:02:56.515 --> 00:02:58.277]  They're saying it in Texas.
[00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:01.560]  They're saying it in Chile and Venezuela.
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:14.873]  They're saying it all over the world, in Brazil, leading the charge for the best leader to come out at a national level and fight for freedom in the last 50 years, Bolsonaro.
[00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.931]  They meant to carry all this out and blame our national leaders as puppets.
[00:03:23.152 --> 00:03:26.153]  But enough leaders got in, like Orban and others, to expose it.
[00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:30.235]  We have enough talk show hosts reaching big enough audiences to get the truth out.
[00:03:31.075 --> 00:03:40.119]  Like this broadcast, the blast point, the detonation point, Patient Zero of Liberty, the epicenter, this audience, activists, you did it.
[00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.361]  I want you to know the important work you've done, so you'll keep fighting harder, because we're winning.
[00:03:45.796 --> 00:03:50.239]  Tucker Carlson's of the world hammering the Great Reset and the New World Order.
[00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.940]  Joe Rogan hammering it almost every podcast.
[00:03:53.721 --> 00:03:58.544]  It's happening as good old Ron Paul used to like to say.
[00:03:58.784 --> 00:03:59.625]  It's happening.
[00:04:01.926 --> 00:04:13.607]   But if it wasn't for all the Countless patriots in the last 60, 70 years, particularly in the UK and the US, exposing this coming New World Order, we'd be caught completely flat-footed.
[00:04:13.647 --> 00:04:16.448]  But we are not, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:18.128 --> 00:04:19.208]  This is quite a moment.
[00:04:19.388 --> 00:04:23.309]  We obviously have all of this big news here for you today.
[00:04:24.489 --> 00:04:31.831]  And then the media, for about six hours, tried to deny what they denied back in the presidential election two years ago.
[00:04:32.984 --> 00:05:02.659]   When Hunter's laptop was left at the repair shop and he wouldn't come pick it up so the owner opened it up and saw all the child porn and illegal stuff and the sex trafficking and the drug use and all the rest of the bizarreness and illegal activity and the information went public and the corporate media And Big Tech censored members of Congress.
[00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:03.719]  They censored the president.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.201]  They censored everyone, including InfoWars, trying to expose it.
[00:05:07.821 --> 00:05:18.685]  Well, this time 4chan, someone was able to hack in to Hunter Biden's iCloud and was able to then release the entire phone.
[00:05:19.226 --> 00:05:22.187]  At first, the media, the controlled lapdogs, tried to deny it was real.
[00:05:22.907 --> 00:05:23.968]  But no one bought that.
[00:05:24.448 --> 00:05:26.889]  This time showing how their power has waned massively.
[00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:35.255]  And I can tell you, starting last night and this morning, I looked at quite a bit of it and we're showing you the PG stuff in comparison.
[00:05:35.936 --> 00:05:45.184]  He likes to pose with his niece and others naked, sitting on the edge of a bed as the trophy of the children he has sex with.
[00:05:46.004 --> 00:05:49.167]  He also has his father in the email sending him porn.
[00:05:50.008 --> 00:06:01.694]   And we now know Biden, the puppet president, his handle, We now know his pseudonym, and we know the nickname his son has for him as well.
[00:06:01.734 --> 00:06:02.654]  We'll tell you that when we come back.
[00:06:03.834 --> 00:06:05.215]  Peto Pete.
[00:06:06.775 --> 00:06:18.857]  That's the nickname that is used by Hunter Biden's niece for him, and it looks like his father.
[00:06:21.197 --> 00:06:23.818]  And we cannot show you this information on air.
[00:06:25.123 --> 00:06:33.728]  A lot of it is illegal sex trafficking and obviously him in bed with children that look like they're 10 years old as trophies.
[00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:40.051]  We cannot show you and we will not show you the pedophilic material on air.
[00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:44.273]  And quite frankly, after I looked at some of it, I just stopped looking at it last night.
[00:06:45.054 --> 00:06:47.895]  Because never in my life have I looked at things like this.
[00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:50.797]  And as a journalist, I'm a pundit, an analyst.
[00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:56.540]  But I also am a journalist and I just can't look at it.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.481]  I will not look at it.
[00:06:58.841 --> 00:07:00.362]  There's things you can never get out of your head.
[00:07:03.102 --> 00:07:17.687]  And it's just very frightening to know that these are the fully compromised, blackmailed individuals by a plethora of different mafia organizations and governments around the world.
[00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:26.735]  But the screen handle... Pedo Peter.
[00:07:29.856 --> 00:07:30.956]  Hunter's iPad.
[00:07:31.096 --> 00:07:32.137]  Hunter's iPhone.
[00:07:33.617 --> 00:07:34.357]  It's unbelievable.
[00:07:35.278 --> 00:07:40.919]  And it's also him ordering hookers and clearly underage girls that look like they're about 13 years old.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:48.442]  It's him quasi-naked in trophy photos with his niece.
[00:07:49.793 --> 00:07:51.974]  And with other girls that are clearly underage.
[00:07:53.075 --> 00:07:54.976]  And there's stuff a lot worse than that.
[00:07:55.736 --> 00:08:03.300]  But, you know, you can't help but feel really grungy when you look at dozens of videos of him masturbating.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:09.103]  I mean, you're not ever supposed to look at this stuff.
[00:08:09.703 --> 00:08:10.744]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:08:11.384 --> 00:08:14.326]  And the things we are showing are PG.
[00:08:16.522 --> 00:08:18.862]  In comparison to what's going on.
[00:08:18.922 --> 00:08:44.427]  But more importantly than even the pedophilia and the sex trafficking and the incredible crack cocaine and other drug binges is him and his father talking about paper play and how Hunter's gonna meet with this group and get the money and then pay his dad and pay Joe Biden's brother and the rest of the family using the drug addict Hunter as the bag man.
[00:08:46.363 --> 00:09:03.957]  And then there are the dozens, and I mean dozens, of phone numbers of prominent high-level Justice Department officials and FBI agents groveling and just kissing his pervert butt to go after his political enemies going back years.
[00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:17.593]  So if you want to get a real fly-on-the-wall view into just how corrupt the Justice Department is, and how they're a bunch of sex-trafficking, pedophile-enabling garbage at the top, this is it.
[00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:21.393]  There's no way the system will survive any of this.
[00:09:22.314 --> 00:09:24.994]  And by the way, the Great Reset Globalists set it up this way.
[00:09:25.394 --> 00:09:28.235]  They hope to bring down our whole government in a civil war while they don't get to blame.
[00:09:30.473 --> 00:09:34.477]  They're going to get the blame because they're the ones that control these minions.
[00:09:34.517 --> 00:09:43.244]  Yeah, if you've got a mafia captain that's out committing crimes, I want to see them arrested, indicted, imprisoned.
[00:09:44.345 --> 00:09:45.826]  But we want to get the dons.
[00:09:45.947 --> 00:09:47.608]  We want to get the crime bosses.
[00:09:48.409 --> 00:09:54.274]  And the crime bosses are the Bill Gates and the Prince Charleses of the world.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:04.086]  The Ted Turners and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and the Henry Kissingers of the world.
[00:10:05.767 --> 00:10:10.972]  And you're not in their club unless you're a rapist or a pedophile or a mass murderer or all three.
[00:10:11.973 --> 00:10:13.174]  Look at Harvey Weinstein.
[00:10:14.815 --> 00:10:19.419]  Getting women supplied to him and supplying women to Hillary and Oprah Winfrey.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.023]  And it's come out on both women that they've seen more tail than a toilet seat.
[00:10:25.646 --> 00:10:35.028]  Or a bicycle seat, but the issue is these are underage girls and women forced in to do this for their jobs in Hollywood and in D.C.
[00:10:35.749 --> 00:10:46.331]  Hillary out of college with her law degree, first job she took was working for the mafia in Little Rock and Hot Springs, Arkansas.
[00:10:46.411 --> 00:10:48.132]  I'm going to go the mafia in Arkansas, yeah.
[00:10:49.212 --> 00:11:04.267]  The headquarters of the major mafia organizations in the country until the 80s was not Las Vegas, was not New York City, was not Los Angeles, was not Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.
[00:11:05.568 --> 00:11:09.612]  It was, and still to a certain extent is, Little Rock.
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.140]  And Hot Springs.
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.061]  Anybody that lives in Arkansas knows that.
[00:11:13.101 --> 00:11:14.081]  It's well-known.
[00:11:14.101 --> 00:11:15.561]  They have Mafia museums there.
[00:11:16.942 --> 00:11:19.002]  That's where Al Capone lived most of the year.
[00:11:19.282 --> 00:11:26.344]  I mean, that's where the Chicago Mafia's headquarters was since the 30s in Prohibition.
[00:11:28.264 --> 00:11:33.625]  That's where they made the majority of the liquor that wasn't shipped in from Canada.
[00:11:35.826 --> 00:11:39.707]  And so she was sent there by her father, who was number two in the daily machine.
[00:11:40.782 --> 00:11:46.963]  In the Chicago Mob, she was sent down there to represent the Mafia.
[00:11:48.404 --> 00:12:07.248]  And her first big cases were the rape and torture of women and little girls in the brothels, and these rich mobsters, they also had the Hicks working for them, so it was a big Dixie Mafia there, would just grab a 10-year-old girl off a bicycle, take her and rape her for two days.
[00:12:08.956 --> 00:12:28.350]  I've interviewed some of those women in studio with their shattered faces and they can never have children again because after they raped one 11-year-old for two days at a shack at a farm, drunk, playing poker, they took a broom handle and shoved it all the way up in her, ripping out her uterus and had to be removed.
[00:12:29.371 --> 00:12:30.331]  These are horrible people.
[00:12:30.752 --> 00:12:36.356]  Hillary Clinton made jokes about that on tape and made sure the person that did that, that little girl, walked.
[00:12:37.907 --> 00:12:44.809]  Men that take broomsticks and ram them two feet inside somebody's guts is who these people are.
[00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.311]  They hate you and your family.
[00:12:49.491 --> 00:12:50.451]  They hate America.
[00:12:51.712 --> 00:12:52.612]  They hate free speech.
[00:12:52.672 --> 00:12:53.492]  They hate God.
[00:12:53.533 --> 00:12:54.433]  They hate our children.
[00:12:55.133 --> 00:12:57.414]  And you see the evidence of what they do once they're in charge.
[00:12:59.415 --> 00:13:01.675]  So, that's who they are.
[00:13:01.715 --> 00:13:05.977]  A collection of devil-worshipping, drug addict, pedophiles.
[00:13:08.766 --> 00:13:18.633]  And now they're cutting our resources off, they've erased our border, they've devalued our currency, and they're starting World War III, and they're just beginning their plan.
[00:13:22.216 --> 00:13:24.898]  So now nobody's denying that it's Hunter Biden.
[00:13:24.938 --> 00:13:26.539]  Of course it's Hunter Biden in all these videos.
[00:13:28.701 --> 00:13:30.583]  And now even more information is coming out.
[00:13:31.443 --> 00:13:35.967]  And the FBI is in scramble mode to protect this pedophile.
[00:13:36.728 --> 00:13:42.008]   and his pedophile father. Because Biden's the placeholder and the fall guy for their
[00:13:42.008 --> 00:13:46.407]   new world order. I need to keep him in there a while longer so they don't get the blame,
[00:13:46.407 --> 00:13:51.208]   so the great reset can move forward. And of course, evidence of that, I told you this was coming.
[00:13:51.208 --> 00:13:56.247]  My mom's a really smart person.
[00:13:56.496 --> 00:14:00.778]  And when Biden was installed a year and a half ago, she said, mark my words.
[00:14:00.818 --> 00:14:02.879]  I've said this many times, told you this.
[00:14:03.799 --> 00:14:05.740]  And every time I see her, she says this, she goes, mark my words.
[00:14:06.341 --> 00:14:08.782]  They're planning to kill Biden as a false flag.
[00:14:09.402 --> 00:14:14.405]  The only way to get rid of him and then make all the crimes he committed not seem as bad in a way to change the subject.
[00:14:14.805 --> 00:14:16.946]  And they'll claim it's some right-wing gun owner that does it.
[00:14:19.848 --> 00:14:20.588]  And I agree with my mother.
[00:14:23.052 --> 00:14:24.973]  Breaking a lot of my smarts, you could say.
[00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:29.735]  But I think it's pretty much a common sense thing, the way they're building this up, that they're going to kill Biden.
[00:14:30.435 --> 00:14:32.115]  I really think they're going to kill him.
[00:14:33.436 --> 00:14:34.496]  I'm not predicting it's going to happen.
[00:14:34.516 --> 00:14:37.698]  I'm saying there's a very good chance they'll kill him before the midterms.
[00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:44.100]  I'm predicting the deep state will assassinate Biden in a false flag.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.082]  I give it a 90% probability in the next 120 days.
[00:14:50.102 --> 00:14:51.503]  They might wait and do it later.
[00:14:53.553 --> 00:14:57.618]  Well, in the main election, but they're definitely positioning all this.
[00:14:57.638 --> 00:15:03.766]  They could have an October surprise of assassinating Trump right before the election to cause a civil war, or they could arrest Trump as well.
[00:15:04.147 --> 00:15:08.572]  We know they've got that in the hopper, though that may be a little too far for even them.
[00:15:10.765 --> 00:15:12.787]  But you see the poll numbers and we'll come out and cover it.
[00:15:12.807 --> 00:15:15.490]  Now the New York Times has basically called for the removal of Biden.
[00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.313]  And so the bell has tolled, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:21.816]  It's a big broadcast lined up for you here today.
[00:15:22.457 --> 00:15:30.204]  Banned.videos, where all the forbidden videos and reports by not just Infowars, but so many other censored, incredible researchers and patriots can be found.
[00:15:30.645 --> 00:15:31.646]  Banned.video.

[00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:53.502]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[00:15:54.363 --> 00:15:55.364]  It's the InfoWar.
[00:15:56.224 --> 00:15:59.427]  It's all tied together under global government.
[00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:05.193]  We're going to look at Sri Lanka and the carbon regulations that were put in there a year and a half ago.
[00:16:05.673 --> 00:16:10.096]  The exact same global government system being implemented in Europe and now coming to the United States.
[00:16:10.916 --> 00:16:13.958]  We will ban beef and you will eat ze bugs.
[00:16:15.178 --> 00:16:17.400]  But let's get back to what I was just mentioning before the break.
[00:16:19.001 --> 00:16:19.861]  It's paradoxical.
[00:16:19.921 --> 00:16:20.882]  Yes, Biden's horrible.
[00:16:20.902 --> 00:16:21.802]  Yes, we want to get rid of him.
[00:16:22.162 --> 00:16:25.384]  Yes, he needs to be impeached so that his crimes are exposed.
[00:16:26.145 --> 00:16:28.306]  And who controls him will be exposed.
[00:16:31.363 --> 00:16:32.984]  And yes, it's good to get rid of Boris Johnson.
[00:16:33.044 --> 00:16:34.904]  And yes, it's good for Merkel to step down.
[00:16:35.324 --> 00:16:36.865]  And yes, all of this is true.
[00:16:36.885 --> 00:16:41.327]  And it's good that the Sri Lankan government, that was totally globalist-run, has been overthrown.
[00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:42.767]  The right of the people.
[00:16:44.368 --> 00:16:55.052]  But if they don't then go after the central banks, and the globalists, and the New World Order, and the globalist ruling class that did this, then all they would have done is further destabilize their countries.
[00:16:57.557 --> 00:16:58.638]  So I said it before the break.
[00:16:59.478 --> 00:17:02.360]  One of the major moves, if I was a globalist, I would make.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.660]  I'm not calling for violence.
[00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:05.301]  It's a terrible thing.
[00:17:05.321 --> 00:17:06.202]  It'll actually help them.
[00:17:07.343 --> 00:17:09.284]  I wish no harm against Biden or any of these people.
[00:17:09.724 --> 00:17:11.745]  I want them to be tried and put in prison.
[00:17:12.525 --> 00:17:13.106]  Reprocess.
[00:17:15.727 --> 00:17:20.170]  But now national polls are showing what we already knew, but they've been skewing them.
[00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:21.931]  Now they're putting out accurate polls.
[00:17:21.951 --> 00:17:26.809]   If you go into the methodology of the polls, They always sample 15 points more for Democrat.
[00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.390]  And they always bake into these polls higher numbers.
[00:17:31.671 --> 00:17:35.472]  But now Biden is polling in the 20s.
[00:17:37.453 --> 00:17:40.894]  Joe Biden's approval rating sinks to historic 29%.
[00:17:41.534 --> 00:17:43.075]  Believe me, folks, it's way lower than that.
[00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:43.715]  It might be 10%.
[00:17:47.976 --> 00:17:48.717]  Knives out.
[00:17:48.957 --> 00:17:52.058]  New York Times just said what we all know is true about Joe Biden.
[00:17:54.079 --> 00:17:59.423]  Here's the New York Times.
[00:18:01.065 --> 00:18:10.011]  As if Joe Biden's the one bringing us into this quote, great reset, this great transition.
[00:18:11.553 --> 00:18:12.734]  As if it's all his fault.
[00:18:12.774 --> 00:18:14.375]  So see, they have their cake, they eat it too.
[00:18:15.376 --> 00:18:15.416]  Oh!
[00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:20.245]  Leaders all over the world just implemented the exact same policies by accident.
[00:18:20.305 --> 00:18:32.220]  No, if you read deeper and actually watch their speeches, they're following the Great Reset of the Bilderberg Group and its public relations arm, the Dabos Group, the World Economic Forum.
[00:18:33.956 --> 00:18:36.277]  Texas grid operator warns of blackouts.
[00:18:36.317 --> 00:18:37.217]  That was months ago.
[00:18:37.837 --> 00:18:39.738]  They're not allowed to use coal.
[00:18:40.418 --> 00:18:41.878]  They've shut down most of those plants.
[00:18:42.699 --> 00:18:45.620]  They're given massive million dollar a day fines if they do.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:51.722]  And they've got to get permission to even do that and get fined if they don't prison time.
[00:18:51.742 --> 00:18:56.863]  Remember a year and a half ago on Valentine's Day?
[00:18:57.924 --> 00:19:01.865]  A week before they sent a letter saying we know a big blue northerner is scheduled to be here in about six days.
[00:19:02.858 --> 00:19:06.420]  We need to be able to up the capacity of these coal power plants and gas power plants.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.582]  And Joe Biden, who'd just gotten into office, said, no!
[00:19:14.283 --> 00:19:16.104]  With three big exclamation points.
[00:19:17.925 --> 00:19:21.666]  And so the power went off for up to two weeks and hundreds of people died.
[00:19:21.947 --> 00:19:27.029]  And the power companies were able to gouge people and made 20 plus billion dollars.
[00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.972]  I predicted it all because I'd seen Enron do similar things.
[00:19:31.953 --> 00:19:33.114]  We know the plays they run.
[00:19:33.154 --> 00:19:35.836]  We know their scams of their Build Back Better system.
[00:19:37.357 --> 00:19:39.218]  And that was the power operators months ago.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.762]  And now they have come out with the actual announcements.
[00:19:45.003 --> 00:19:46.083]  Reuters today.
[00:19:47.705 --> 00:19:51.588]  Texas grid operator warns of potential rolling blackouts today.
[00:19:53.186 --> 00:19:53.526]  Reuters.
[00:19:54.386 --> 00:19:57.287]  ERCOT issues call for voluntary conservation.
[00:19:57.807 --> 00:20:01.408]  That's right, you've got to conserve because they cut your power.
[00:20:01.428 --> 00:20:03.028]  You're learning in this great transition.
[00:20:03.048 --> 00:20:05.488]  Like Germany said, no more heating in your houses.
[00:20:05.888 --> 00:20:11.230]  The government's going to put warming tents on every street where the government will give you a place to be warm.
[00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:14.490]  Here's ERCOT in South Austin.
[00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.691]  Issues call for voluntary conservation.
[00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:18.451]  Dallas News.
[00:20:19.653 --> 00:20:23.014]  Texas warned to reduce electricity use amid fear of rolling backouts.
[00:20:23.094 --> 00:20:25.755]  Well, what did we do?
[00:20:25.795 --> 00:20:30.316]  We just went and put a $50,000 generator on the building.
[00:20:33.157 --> 00:20:36.038]  And then, of course, hooking it up to everything cost another $100,000.
[00:20:36.098 --> 00:20:36.858]  But we did it.
[00:20:37.498 --> 00:20:38.158]  You funded us.
[00:20:39.058 --> 00:20:43.079]  And now when the power goes off today, we'll be able to continue to stay on.
[00:20:43.099 --> 00:20:44.400]  People said, why don't you just get some batteries?
[00:20:45.393 --> 00:20:51.915]  Oh, we had batteries that cost more than $50,000 here in these studios, and they failed in eight hours.
[00:20:53.296 --> 00:20:54.456]  They're ready to go six.
[00:20:54.496 --> 00:20:58.858]  They went further than they were rated to, and then we were in the dark.
[00:20:58.878 --> 00:20:59.658]  Remember?
[00:21:00.138 --> 00:21:07.621]  We had gas generators in here running it with one light on me, because it's all the power we had, for a week and a half.
[00:21:09.537 --> 00:21:11.457]  And I told you, this is the new way of life.
[00:21:11.977 --> 00:21:13.238]  They had articles making fun of me.
[00:21:13.278 --> 00:21:14.138]  Jones is crazy.
[00:21:14.158 --> 00:21:15.058]  He says it's on purpose.
[00:21:15.738 --> 00:21:18.539]  The PolitiFact said, oh, the feds didn't order the shutdown.
[00:21:18.559 --> 00:21:19.699]  Yeah, they did.
[00:21:20.119 --> 00:21:21.039]  We showed the documents.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.300]  The Environmental Protection Agency.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.021]  And what did the Supreme Court rule a week and a half ago?
[00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:34.242]  They said the EPA cannot just make law by pulling it out of their rear end.
[00:21:37.475 --> 00:21:38.997]  Congress has to make the laws.
[00:21:39.878 --> 00:21:45.305]  And so now all those regulations have been overturned, but you notice they're still in place.
[00:21:45.325 --> 00:21:50.191]  Kind of like Supreme Court rules ten plus years ago that you can't ban guns in DC.
[00:21:50.251 --> 00:21:50.892]  They're still banned.
[00:21:55.698 --> 00:22:02.879]  Euronews, Austria to reopen closed coal power station despite climate goals because they have to get ready for it.
[00:22:03.579 --> 00:22:06.720]  Power the government buildings and key infrastructure.
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:31.266]   You see, when the power went off in Texas or when the power goes off in Spain, it's the same all over the world, or under Ceaușescu's Romania, when the power goes off, the grid set up where the essential areas, the rich elite areas, And the hospitals and the police stations and the government buildings, they all keep operating, but you're in the dark.
[00:22:31.326 --> 00:22:42.452]  So I was in the dark with no water and no electricity at my house other than some solar panels, but it was too dark to get a lot of power, and a small gas generator for almost two weeks.
[00:22:42.712 --> 00:22:45.314]  And I live in a nice area, but it's not the Richie Rich area.
[00:22:45.834 --> 00:22:54.759]  The area that's called essential in Austin is called Tarrytown, and it's the oldest part of Austin, and it's in Central West Austin, and it's where all the government and elites live.
[00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.191]  And the movie stars, all the rest of them, and guess what?
[00:22:58.491 --> 00:23:02.552]  They never had any of their power go off, because they're special.
[00:23:05.052 --> 00:23:06.013]  They're special.
[00:23:09.253 --> 00:23:17.664]   And a lot of people I know personally that live in blue collar or working class or middle class areas, they had their power because they live right next to A hospital or government building.
[00:23:18.144 --> 00:23:20.246]  So that's how this system works.
[00:23:20.286 --> 00:23:26.330]  So Austria reopened closed coal-fired plant station despite climate goals.
[00:23:27.911 --> 00:23:33.975]  Energy market turmoil caused by the war in Ukraine has triggered an increase in cold-fired electricity production in the European Union.
[00:23:36.717 --> 00:23:42.461]  So now you know why they're protesting by the millions in the Netherlands.
[00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:45.870]  And all over the world.
[00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.091]  We're going to cover that when we come back.
[00:23:48.071 --> 00:23:52.535]  And the same model is implemented everywhere, because it is the Great Reset.
[00:23:52.875 --> 00:23:56.497]  Doesn't matter if you're the Sri Lankan leader, or the Australian leader, or the U.S.
[00:23:56.558 --> 00:24:03.062]  puppet leader, they all use the same words and the same policies, because it's a global, corporate, government, New World Order system.
[00:24:04.363 --> 00:24:10.328]  Broadcasting worldwide in defense of human liberty, we are the resistance.
[00:24:10.508 --> 00:24:11.909]  We are the real rabbit holes.
[00:24:15.339 --> 00:24:16.120]  The black sheep.
[00:24:17.621 --> 00:24:18.462]  And proud of it.
[00:24:21.605 --> 00:24:23.886]  Humanity is getting off its knees.
[00:24:24.627 --> 00:24:27.329]  Humanity is rising!
[00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:31.033]  And I am getting chills through my entire core of my body.
[00:24:32.554 --> 00:24:34.256]  I can feel the awakening.
[00:24:34.976 --> 00:24:36.618]  I can see the awakening.
[00:24:37.398 --> 00:24:47.372]   And I am so proud of the people From as far away as Sri Lanka, to the Netherlands, to Mexico, to Brazil, to South Africa, to Nigeria, to Kenya.
[00:24:48.932 --> 00:24:56.194]  From Eastern Europe to the Pacific Islands, humanity is taking the blinders off.
[00:24:57.795 --> 00:24:59.796]  And the globalists are going down.
[00:25:04.017 --> 00:25:06.798]  What we need is Nuremberg II.
[00:25:07.518 --> 00:25:08.979]  World trials.
[00:25:10.336 --> 00:25:17.240]  We need them convicted, we need them marched up to the gallows, and we need to break their necks.
[00:25:20.442 --> 00:25:24.224]  But only once they've been given a fair trial.
[00:25:26.265 --> 00:25:35.891]  Then, they will dangle for the world to see in full HD, kicking and shitting and pissing down their legs.
[00:25:38.319 --> 00:25:42.263]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen, on this live Monday broadcast.
[00:25:43.604 --> 00:25:45.927]  The New World Order is turning the power off.
[00:25:46.627 --> 00:25:51.692]  They're turning the lights off to bring you and I and all of us to our knees.
[00:25:53.374 --> 00:26:02.259]   But if we are aware of them and that they are the authors of our pain, it is they that will be The ashes of history.
[00:26:02.959 --> 00:26:08.423]  And it is our new system that we will build back better, that will be constructed on their bones.
[00:26:09.764 --> 00:26:16.428]  Their physical bones, but more importantly the bones of the political ideologies of the elite and their neo-feudalistic system.
[00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.610]  The U.S.
[00:26:19.671 --> 00:26:26.735]  sees Russia food blockage as factor in Sri Lanka crisis.
[00:26:26.795 --> 00:26:33.382]   Yes, and It's the gas station owners that shut off all the pipelines and everything here in the U.S.
[00:26:33.402 --> 00:26:34.022]  too, right?
[00:26:34.062 --> 00:26:35.262]  That's why the gas costs so much.
[00:26:35.662 --> 00:26:37.503]  Not the central banks printing so much money either.
[00:26:39.043 --> 00:26:39.243]  U.S.
[00:26:39.283 --> 00:26:52.186]  Secretary of State Antony Blinken said growing food insecurity around the world has been significantly exacerbated by the Russian aggression against Ukraine.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.581]  Yeah, maybe 1% of it.
[00:26:56.261 --> 00:27:04.908]  No, it was two years ago they signed on to the Paris Climate Accords and they cut the number of cattle in the country by half.
[00:27:05.869 --> 00:27:06.409]  First year it's 30%.
[00:27:06.449 --> 00:27:08.751]  Just like it's happening in Europe.
[00:27:09.892 --> 00:27:10.473]  Really happening.
[00:27:12.214 --> 00:27:13.195]  You will eat some bugs.
[00:27:13.415 --> 00:27:14.656]  You will own nothing and you will like it.
[00:27:15.697 --> 00:27:19.800]  They also are now trying to take the farms of most of the farmers and give it to big agribusiness.
[00:27:21.803 --> 00:27:24.824]  They are deliberately creating the food crises.
[00:27:25.305 --> 00:27:26.325]  And here's some of the articles.
[00:27:26.905 --> 00:27:27.906]  Complete collapse.
[00:27:27.946 --> 00:27:35.449]  Here's how the ESG, that's the big UN program that environmentally scores businesses and shuts them down.
[00:27:36.109 --> 00:27:36.850]  Complete collapse.
[00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.872]  Here's how the ESG's destroyed one nation's economy.
[00:27:41.012 --> 00:27:41.512]  Sri Lanka.
[00:27:45.003 --> 00:27:49.087]  In Sri Lanka, organic farming went catastrophically wrong, but it's not even organic.
[00:27:49.787 --> 00:27:53.591]  A nationwide experiment is abandoned after producing only misery.
[00:27:54.392 --> 00:27:55.633]  That's from March of this year.
[00:27:56.173 --> 00:27:57.515]  And now you see the aftermath.
[00:27:58.215 --> 00:27:59.156]  Overthrow of the government.
[00:28:00.257 --> 00:28:01.779]  And the ransacking of the central bank.
[00:28:04.101 --> 00:28:06.042]  And the total rejection of the New World Order.
[00:28:07.043 --> 00:28:10.547]  Ways to meet the impending food crisis in Sri Lanka!
[00:28:11.806 --> 00:28:26.216]  The food crisis caused in the last two years by the carbon initiative banning methane and nitrogen, both of which make up the life cycle on this planet and are essential to all carbon-based life forms.
[00:28:27.417 --> 00:28:31.040]  Life on the face of the earth creates the atmosphere.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.062]  In fact, there was a clip yesterday we didn't play.
[00:28:35.459 --> 00:28:38.302]  Of Mr. Jones, a big national talk show host on Sky News.
[00:28:38.322 --> 00:28:39.503]  I forget his first name.
[00:28:40.624 --> 00:28:50.794]  And he was on another national TV show pointing out that carbon dioxide isn't even 1% of the atmosphere and it's been dozens of times higher in our past.
[00:28:51.394 --> 00:28:54.157]  We had higher oxygen levels and healthier plants and animals.
[00:28:57.577 --> 00:29:13.994]  Here is a clip of them talking about shutting down everything, banning cows, banning sheep, banning goats, banning chickens, banning basically everything, starving everyone to death to save the earth because we're going to have rising sea levels as all the elites buy oceanfront property.
[00:29:15.175 --> 00:29:15.616]  Here's the clip.
[00:29:16.694 --> 00:29:37.558]  When I asked Tanya Plibersek, the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party and the potential Deputy Prime Minister, was carbon dioxide the big issue in relation to climate change?
[00:29:37.938 --> 00:29:38.698]  And she said yes.
[00:29:39.558 --> 00:29:45.559]  I then said, well that being the case, what percentage of the atmosphere is made up of carbon dioxide?
[00:29:47.182 --> 00:29:48.042]  And she said, I don't know.
[00:29:49.363 --> 00:29:59.227]  And I said, hang on, you don't know what percentage of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide, and yet you're prepared to stand the economy on its head to address a problem, the detail of which you don't know.
[00:29:59.247 --> 00:30:03.949]  So when I then explained that the percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, Alice, is how much?
[00:30:06.324 --> 00:30:08.887]  Alice, how much of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?
[00:30:09.207 --> 00:30:14.713]  To answer the question, Scott Morrison has said he believes in climate change and that he wants to do something about it.
[00:30:14.733 --> 00:30:16.415]  Alice, how much carbon dioxide is the problem?
[00:30:16.475 --> 00:30:18.417]  How much carbon dioxide is there in the atmosphere?
[00:30:18.577 --> 00:30:19.258]  I'm not a scientist.
[00:30:19.278 --> 00:30:19.898]  I don't know.
[00:30:19.978 --> 00:30:20.339]  Well, hang on.
[00:30:20.379 --> 00:30:22.901]  If you're going to argue the case, you ought to know.
[00:30:22.921 --> 00:30:23.702]  It's 0.04 of a percent.
[00:30:24.463 --> 00:30:28.508]  And of that 0.04%, human beings around the world create 3%.
[00:30:29.409 --> 00:30:32.212]  And of that 3%, Australia creates 1.3%.
[00:30:32.592 --> 00:30:41.902]  So for the 1.3% of 3% of 0.04%, we then decide to have a National Economic Suicide... Alan, Alan, Alan, I'm happy for you to have made that point.
[00:30:43.462 --> 00:30:45.824]  They're not deciding to commit national suicide.
[00:30:45.864 --> 00:30:50.808]  It's the exact same policies as Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Germany, and now the U.S.
[00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:52.870]  By the way, that's Alan Jones.
[00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:59.295]  He's been on TV for 50 years, but they call him the Alex Jones of Australia.
[00:30:59.575 --> 00:31:02.377]  He's just as popular there as I am here, and probably more popular.
[00:31:03.438 --> 00:31:06.301]  And yeah, there he is, Alan Jones, radio broadcaster.
[00:31:07.441 --> 00:31:08.642]  Alan Bedford Jones.
[00:31:10.221 --> 00:31:10.681]  81 years old.
[00:31:10.701 --> 00:31:13.262]  And he just knocks it out of the damn park.
[00:31:14.282 --> 00:31:16.583]  With the facts.
[00:31:16.603 --> 00:31:25.446]  0.4% and it's been 20-30 times the atmosphere what it is.
[00:31:25.486 --> 00:31:28.307]  But in just the last few million years it's been 6-7 times higher.
[00:31:28.787 --> 00:31:30.047]  And you know what happens with plants?
[00:31:31.788 --> 00:31:35.269]  You triple it in the greenhouses and they double their growth and their yield.
[00:31:36.656 --> 00:31:38.536]  And when you keep going up, it becomes even more insane.
[00:31:38.877 --> 00:31:43.778]  Why do you think they dig up plants all over the world, they were three, four times bigger than they are now?
[00:31:44.018 --> 00:31:45.778]  Why do you think the animals used to be so much bigger?
[00:31:47.758 --> 00:31:49.679]  There was more carbon dioxide, there was more oxygen.
[00:31:49.939 --> 00:31:58.821]  This isn't my opinion, by the way, this is mainline anthropologists, and paleontologists, and scientists, and climatologists.
[00:32:00.342 --> 00:32:08.609]  It's a fact, but they've listed a trace gas that is essential for all life on Earth as a toxic waste.
[00:32:09.109 --> 00:32:13.673]  All that comes out of US and European power plants, coal plants, is water vapor and carbon dioxide.
[00:32:13.974 --> 00:32:21.020]  That's why they are so complex, why they have all those tubes and machinery and things, because the coal goes through it and then nothing comes out on the other end.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.903]  Everything else is then used for distillates and steel making and everything else.
[00:32:25.423 --> 00:32:26.384]  It's an amazing science.
[00:32:26.865 --> 00:32:36.350]   Now in China and Mexico, It's just a smokestack and a water turbine because they don't cut any of that out, and they send toxic coal dust with mercury and everything else right in the atmosphere.
[00:32:39.751 --> 00:32:40.632]  And that's dirty coal.
[00:32:40.652 --> 00:32:43.953]  By the way, there's big stores of coal out west in the U.S.
[00:32:44.033 --> 00:32:44.954]  It's only here in the U.S.
[00:32:44.974 --> 00:32:50.176]  and in China, enough to run the country for hundreds of years, if not thousands, they say, just in the U.S.
[00:32:50.216 --> 00:32:50.536]  alone.
[00:32:51.297 --> 00:32:51.917]  It's all clean.
[00:32:52.337 --> 00:32:53.658]  It's called clean coal.
[00:32:53.778 --> 00:32:55.319]  It's so clean, it's pure carbon.
[00:32:56.784 --> 00:32:58.525]  There's no lead, no mercury, no nothing.
[00:32:59.185 --> 00:33:04.446]  There's tons of really toxic coal as well, and I agree, we should use the clean coal first.
[00:33:05.286 --> 00:33:07.967]  We should not be using dirty coal, and we should put scrubbers on them.
[00:33:08.207 --> 00:33:14.349]  That was all reasonable stuff like catalytic converters on cars, and scrubbers on power plants, but they've gotten...
[00:33:15.751 --> 00:33:20.816]  Rid of all that in China and Mexico, or never even implemented it, and then they've gotten rid of our clean systems.
[00:33:21.978 --> 00:33:31.628]  All the studies show, there's a bunch of them, that trees and plants directly downwind, all around, coal power plants grow much faster and are healthier.
[00:33:31.648 --> 00:33:35.272]  Because there's higher carbon dioxide that hasn't dissipated out yet.
[00:33:35.292 --> 00:33:37.274]  It's a fact!
[00:33:38.737 --> 00:33:39.177]  It's a fact.
[00:33:39.257 --> 00:33:40.438]  Look up hydroponics.
[00:33:40.478 --> 00:33:41.479]  Look up indoor growing.
[00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:44.502]  Look, they pump carbon dioxide in, and humans walk around in it.
[00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:47.044]  It doesn't even make them sick, because it's not bad for us.
[00:33:47.544 --> 00:33:48.024]  We'll be right back.
[00:33:47.844 --> 00:34:02.564]  Come back, stay with us.
[00:34:02.816 --> 00:34:03.377]  You better believe it!
[00:34:06.893 --> 00:34:12.492]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:12.492 --> 00:34:26.492]  [Music]
[00:34:26.492 --> 00:34:29.492]  [Music]
[00:34:29.492 --> 00:34:35.492]  [Music]
[00:34:35.492 --> 00:34:37.492]  This equation has four factors.
[00:34:37.817 --> 00:34:39.118]  A little bit of multiplication.
[00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:42.621]  So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero.
[00:34:43.461 --> 00:34:50.300]   And that's gonna be based on the number of people, the services each person's using on average,
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:57.380]   the energy on average for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:02.840]   So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:07.021]   Probably one of these numbers is gonna have to get pretty near to zero.
[00:35:07.021 --> 00:35:11.701]   That's back from high school algebra, but let's take a look.
[00:35:11.701 --> 00:35:14.181]  First we've got population.
[00:35:13.842 --> 00:35:16.085]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[00:35:16.585 --> 00:35:18.167]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[00:35:18.788 --> 00:35:27.159]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[00:35:28.901 --> 00:35:37.251]  Many believed that Bill Gates somehow misspoke when he attributed successful depopulation to the vaccines.
[00:35:37.912 --> 00:35:39.694]  But it's now evident that he didn't.
[00:35:40.575 --> 00:35:44.379]  He was being very clear about the intentions of the globalist agenda.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.483]  Kill 99.99% of all humans.
[00:35:50.483 --> 00:35:54.786]  According to these psychopaths, this is how we will save the planet.
[00:35:55.186 --> 00:36:02.231]  And they have convinced an overwhelming amount of the world's population into accepting their agenda and pushing for it.
[00:36:02.831 --> 00:36:10.739]  People who believe that humans need to be aborted, and believe the human race needs to be culled into a small compliant herd.
[00:36:11.239 --> 00:36:19.107]  People that are okay with billions of people starving, so long as the screens on their devices tell them it's the right thing to do.
[00:36:20.608 --> 00:36:22.930]  But not everyone has gone insane.
[00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:26.511]  Some still have a survival instinct.
[00:36:27.192 --> 00:36:45.322]  When the Dutch government voted in a scheme that will force farmers to cut their livestock down to unsustainable levels, thereby forcing them out of work and shutting down the second biggest food exporter in the world, the farmers did the right thing and said no.
[00:36:46.162 --> 00:36:49.624]  And protests have broken out all throughout the Netherlands.
[00:36:50.985 --> 00:36:58.269]  Shutting down the world's second biggest food exporter is all part of the anti-human zero emissions plan.
[00:36:58.969 --> 00:37:07.294]  And so the Dutch farmers aren't just protesting losing their jobs, they're protesting the mass murder of the world's population.
[00:37:08.872 --> 00:37:19.054]  Just like the Canadian truckers and farmers did last winter, and just like the Canadian police sided with the tyrants, the Dutch cops are doing the same.
[00:37:20.154 --> 00:37:26.095]  Police drawing their sidearms on peaceful protesters, and opening fire on them.
[00:37:26.115 --> 00:37:39.266]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no using undercover agents and provoking violence to shut down
[00:37:39.266 --> 00:37:42.066]  peaceful gatherings.
[00:37:42.066 --> 00:37:57.066]  Because the globalists are not taking no for an answer.
[00:37:57.662 --> 00:38:11.750]  And while you may back the blue, chances are that they won't back you when it comes to the globalist agenda, which has now enlisted A-list celebrities to convince us all to eat bugs.
[00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:17.052]  I'm Nicole Kidman, and I am going to eat a four-course meal of bugs.
[00:38:17.652 --> 00:38:23.314]  They're trying to persuade us into dying peacefully, like good, obedient slaves.
[00:38:24.254 --> 00:38:26.735]  But soon, the food will start to run out.
[00:38:27.295 --> 00:38:37.259]  And worse, more signs of kinetic world war on the horizon, as Japan's longest-standing Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, is assassinated.
[00:38:37.959 --> 00:38:48.523]  And former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev joins President Putin in threatening nuclear annihilation if the United States continues their provocations.
[00:38:49.224 --> 00:38:52.025]  Which is exactly what the Extinction Rebellion wants.
[00:38:52.865 --> 00:38:55.006]  And it's what the Biden administration wants.
[00:38:55.886 --> 00:38:57.766]  It's what everyone in charge wants.
[00:38:58.527 --> 00:39:02.828]  The only way out of this is a worldwide people's revolution.
[00:39:03.228 --> 00:39:08.129]  The Dutch farmers have begun, and they have been joined by people from other nations.
[00:39:08.809 --> 00:39:11.449]  The revolution will not be televised.
[00:39:11.909 --> 00:39:18.191]  And if you want to stand up against evil, then now is the time, while you are still alive.
[00:39:19.451 --> 00:39:26.451]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:39:26.451 --> 00:39:29.451]  Dutch farmers ignite worldwide anti-globalist uprising.
[00:39:29.451 --> 00:39:32.451]  It's at Man.Video. Please go to the Greg Reese section.
[00:39:32.451 --> 00:39:39.451]   Please share it. Please help our brethren around the world and our sisters fight back.
[00:39:39.451 --> 00:39:42.451]  All right, and last segment.
[00:39:42.432 --> 00:39:51.516]  I explained that carbon dioxide has been 25-30 times higher in our planet's past from the ice core and soil samples they have.
[00:39:52.337 --> 00:40:10.806]  And then scientists in the last 100 years did studies in greenhouses and in contained bubbles where they would raise insects and mammals and plants as well as bacteria and other microbes inside a higher oxygen and higher carbon dioxide environment.
[00:40:12.338 --> 00:40:15.540]  And found that they live longer, and they grow bigger.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:21.742]  And so when I mentioned that the scientists know this main line, this is settled science.
[00:40:22.803 --> 00:40:37.350]  It's known fact, like plants need water and sunlight to live, that when you get more carbon dioxide, more oxygen, and the two feed off each other in photosynthesis, plants bring in carbon dioxide and put out oxygen.
[00:40:38.894 --> 00:40:39.414]  Symbiotic.
[00:40:40.075 --> 00:40:42.576]  We bring in oxygen and we put out carbon dioxide.
[00:40:43.417 --> 00:40:51.121]  So by listing carbon dioxide as the big evil and then everything else like nitrogen that plants grow from, you've cornered the market on life and outlawed life.
[00:40:51.821 --> 00:40:54.963]  It's more than just the New York Times headline, soon you'll have to pay to breathe.
[00:40:55.303 --> 00:40:56.164]  That's what this is.
[00:40:56.224 --> 00:41:03.768]  So the crew, search engines, everything I say, and they pulled up a few articles, big mammals evolved thanks to more oxygen.
[00:41:04.408 --> 00:41:05.749]  Scientific American.
[00:41:08.496 --> 00:41:10.998]  And it goes on to say, because carbon dioxide was higher previously.
[00:41:11.979 --> 00:41:12.980]  National Geographic.
[00:41:15.222 --> 00:41:18.225]  Why giant bugs once roamed Earth?
[00:41:22.289 --> 00:41:28.895]  And then it goes in to explain, there was higher carbon dioxide and higher oxygen, and so things were bigger and lived longer and were more healthy.
[00:41:30.871 --> 00:41:36.355]  It is estimated that 300 years ago, the world had the lowest carbon dioxide ever recorded in our history.
[00:41:37.376 --> 00:41:43.440]  Humans have boosted it up just a little bit in the Industrial Revolution in the last 150 years, but not much.
[00:41:46.826 --> 00:41:47.806]  See, these are the facts.
[00:41:47.866 --> 00:41:52.727]  That's why when you see newscasts saying we've got to stop carbon dioxide, it's like saying we've got to cut oxygen off.
[00:41:52.747 --> 00:41:57.548]  But everybody knows oxygen is good for you, even the dumbest, most uneducated person.
[00:41:57.568 --> 00:41:58.688]  So they didn't go with oxygen.
[00:41:59.368 --> 00:42:00.928]  They went with the thing just as important.
[00:42:00.948 --> 00:42:02.929]  Because if you don't have carbon dioxide, you don't have oxygen.
[00:42:04.969 --> 00:42:06.009]  We are terraforming.
[00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.789]  God made us.
[00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:10.370]  Humans, animals, plants live in symbiotic relationship.
[00:42:14.291 --> 00:42:15.151]  And we help each other.
[00:42:16.047 --> 00:42:17.528]  We terraformed the planet.
[00:42:20.429 --> 00:42:21.969]  We are creating the atmosphere.
[00:42:22.749 --> 00:42:30.172]  Methane is key to thickening the atmosphere and having it come closer to the surface of sea level so it doesn't off-gas into space.
[00:42:30.512 --> 00:42:32.633]  Mars once had an atmosphere.
[00:42:34.453 --> 00:42:35.914]  But it wasn't a big enough planet.
[00:42:35.954 --> 00:42:37.134]  It didn't have a big enough gravity.
[00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:42.096]  And so the water left the planet, though it's under the surface, most of it.
[00:42:44.016 --> 00:42:45.157]  Same thing with the moon.
[00:42:46.229 --> 00:42:46.890]  That's been proven.
[00:42:48.691 --> 00:42:49.232]  With probes.
[00:42:50.993 --> 00:42:53.576]  So, that's the reality.
[00:42:54.857 --> 00:43:01.103]  Separately, we've extended the July 4th Mega Sell Biggest of the Year because we don't have more products to sell.
[00:43:01.163 --> 00:43:02.564]  We don't have more stuff to have specials.
[00:43:02.904 --> 00:43:04.005]  We're completely maxed out.
[00:43:04.666 --> 00:43:05.647]  All these are great products.
[00:43:05.687 --> 00:43:06.968]  A bunch of our best sellers are out.
[00:43:07.148 --> 00:43:08.610]  Our best sellers are Vazzo Beats.
[00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.071]  Ultra 12 and X2 are still in.
[00:43:11.091 --> 00:43:12.192]  They'll be sold out soon.

[00:44:16.364 --> 00:44:17.045]  We appreciate you.
[00:44:17.525 --> 00:44:18.545]  Now we need help more than ever.
[00:44:19.086 --> 00:44:22.115]  People are listening more than ever, but the attacks are bigger than ever.
[00:44:22.175 --> 00:44:23.459]  We need your support.
[00:44:23.539 --> 00:44:24.261]  Thank you so much.
[00:44:24.322 --> 00:44:39.001]  We'll be right back with our number two and a special guest.
[00:44:39.159 --> 00:44:41.280]  First time caller, long time listener.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:50.442]  I'm a self-employed 66-year-old senior who last November moved from the suburbs of Detroit to leave the Nazi governor.
[00:44:50.561 --> 00:44:53.920]   I moved to the panhandle of Florida, and at the time my family and friends
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.001]  thought I'd lost my mind.
[00:44:55.001 --> 00:44:57.001]   They no longer think that way, but at the time they did.
[00:44:57.001 --> 00:45:00.641]   And I wanna say God bless you, stay on the air, the devil is a liar.
[00:45:00.641 --> 00:45:02.400]  I'm gonna plug one of your products.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.641]   I listen all the time, and I heard this guy talking about
[00:45:04.641 --> 00:45:07.440]   the iodine supplement, X2, saying, "Well, he's been taking it,
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.362]   "and his memory's getting better, "and he's having dreams."
[00:45:09.362 --> 00:45:10.440]  And I'm like, "Yeah, maybe."
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.201]   So I had to go back to Michigan for three weeks for business.
[00:45:13.201 --> 00:45:16.961]   I came back, and for a week, I had massive sinus headache,
[00:45:16.961 --> 00:45:20.201]   massive sinus condition, and a earache that was driving me nuts.
[00:45:20.187 --> 00:45:21.708]  I said, you know what, I'm gonna try the X2.
[00:45:21.728 --> 00:45:22.448]  I had just gotten it.
[00:45:22.488 --> 00:45:26.171]  Two days later, earache was gone, sinuses were cleared, no headaches.
[00:45:26.432 --> 00:45:27.833]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:45:27.913 --> 00:45:29.314]  This stuff is real.
[00:45:29.414 --> 00:45:29.874]  It works.
[00:45:30.195 --> 00:45:31.916]  So, anyways, I want to thank you for all that.
[00:45:33.798 --> 00:45:41.364]  John Bowne knocks it out of the park, and then a major congressional candidate, Jerome Davidson, joins us, coming up next segment.
[00:45:44.964 --> 00:45:51.829]  Why did the Supreme Court do the right thing and overturn Roe v. Wade just under the Constitution and kick it back to the states?
[00:45:52.369 --> 00:46:08.420]  One of the reasons why this issue is so hotly contested in the United States is that it wasn't decided by the people through the democratic process of the legislatures and now it will be and it will go to the states where those states will be able to reflect the will and the views of the people who live there.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:17.849]   A lot of reasons but the big one is that we have 3d models Yeah, I would murder them!
[00:46:17.669 --> 00:46:24.048]   20 plus years of babies in the womb, sucking their thumbs and even two, three months,
[00:46:24.048 --> 00:46:27.869]  playing, dancing, and we know that's a human.
[00:46:27.869 --> 00:46:34.188]   And then you've got the pro-abortion crowd saying it's a satanic sacrament in court,
[00:46:34.188 --> 00:46:37.449]   saying we're gonna kill those little bastards, wearing shirts, celebrating,
[00:46:37.449 --> 00:46:39.669]  yeah, I killed my baby, I'm gonna kill more.
[00:46:39.669 --> 00:46:40.868]  Yeah, I would murder them.
[00:46:40.868 --> 00:46:43.789]  (slow motion yelling)
[00:46:43.789 --> 00:46:45.868]  I'll slit their throats if I have to.
[00:46:45.868 --> 00:46:49.869]   and really showing us how sick and evil they are and their cult of death.
[00:46:50.301 --> 00:46:54.523]  Now it's not a total overturn of Roe v. Wade saying that it's illegal.
[00:46:55.163 --> 00:46:58.124]  Well, states can't announce slavery is legal again.
[00:46:58.324 --> 00:47:07.687]  The statement has been made that the government has a right to come in your home and tell you as a woman and as a family what you should do with your body.
[00:47:07.987 --> 00:47:10.988]  This is not about freedom or personal choice.
[00:47:12.884 --> 00:47:19.666]  We also know that we've had a history in this country of government trying to claim ownership over human bodies.
[00:47:19.826 --> 00:47:20.507]  Exactly!
[00:47:21.067 --> 00:47:22.968]  States can't announce that they can take your guns.
[00:47:23.028 --> 00:47:26.089]  States can't announce any of that in our republic system.
[00:47:26.529 --> 00:47:30.710]  It was the left's celebration of killing babies up to their due date.
[00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:38.073]  And then multiple states, like New York, passing laws you could kill babies for weeks after birth?
[00:47:38.573 --> 00:47:39.554]  I'm talking about your bill.
[00:47:40.834 --> 00:47:48.139]  How late in the third trimester could a physician perform an abortion if he indicated it would impair the mental health of the woman?
[00:47:48.539 --> 00:47:50.520]  So, I mean, through the third trimester.
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:52.661]  The third trimester goes all the way up to 40 weeks.
[00:47:53.122 --> 00:47:55.243]  Okay, but to the end of the third trimester?
[00:47:55.683 --> 00:47:56.964]  I don't think we have a limit in the bill.
[00:47:57.204 --> 00:48:08.011]   Where it's obvious that a woman is about to Would that still be a point at which she could request an abortion if she was so certified?
[00:48:08.031 --> 00:48:15.815]  Uh, Mr. Chairman, that would be a, you know, a decision that the doctor, the physician, and the woman would make at that point.
[00:48:15.835 --> 00:48:16.195]  I understand that.
[00:48:16.215 --> 00:48:17.515]  I'm asking if your bill allows that.
[00:48:18.236 --> 00:48:19.496]  My bill would allow that, yes.
[00:48:19.876 --> 00:48:21.877]  And people were like, what the hell is this?
[00:48:23.378 --> 00:48:28.580]  And finally started waking up out of their comas.
[00:48:29.301 --> 00:48:31.522]  I am Dr. Bernard N. Nasonson.
[00:48:32.363 --> 00:48:51.331]  I'm formerly the director of the largest abortion clinic in the Western world, and I am the last surviving founding member of NARAL, a pro-abortion organization which brought legal abortion to the entire United States.
[00:48:52.832 --> 00:48:55.213]  I am personally responsible for over 75,000 abortions.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:09.349]  We founded NARAL in the late 1960s with our purpose to export our pro-abortion mentality everywhere.
[00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:20.738]  To achieve that end, we adopted a strategy to deny what we knew to be true, that abortion kills an existing, living human being.
[00:49:22.708 --> 00:49:29.350]  We denied that fact in an effort to mislead the American public and the courts of this land.
[00:49:30.491 --> 00:49:39.234]  This was the greatest mistake of my life and legal abortion was the greatest mistake this nation has ever conceived.
[00:49:39.814 --> 00:49:49.097]  This shows in this sea of evil and corruption and collapsing borders and devalued currencies and pedophilia and world government attacks on the family and all of it.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.721]  That humanity is coming back.
[00:49:53.421 --> 00:50:01.504]  You've got to have the will to accept the truth and fuck the system and the group collective.
[00:50:02.544 --> 00:50:06.305]  Do that, and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[00:50:07.466 --> 00:50:09.466]  This is the InfoWar.
[00:50:09.466 --> 00:50:25.466]  [Music]
[00:50:25.466 --> 00:50:34.466]   There is an incredible wave of populist conservative candidates across this country.
[00:50:34.709 --> 00:50:38.293]  And I am so excited about the victories they've been having in their primaries.
[00:50:39.515 --> 00:50:42.879]  Jerome Davison is going to be our guest for the next 40 minutes or so.
[00:50:42.899 --> 00:50:46.322]  Then we're going to open the phones up and take calls to balance the broadcast and cover the Hunter.
[00:50:46.963 --> 00:50:50.043]  Biden pedophilic laptop.
[00:50:50.043 --> 00:50:53.863]   But we're very honored to have Jerome Davidson on with us here.
[00:50:53.863 --> 00:50:56.083]  He's a former NFL player and so much more.
[00:50:56.083 --> 00:51:00.043]   But what's really great about him is that he is in the globalist faces
[00:51:00.043 --> 00:51:03.923]  and is absolutely creating a lot of excitement.
[00:51:03.923 --> 00:51:05.083]  And they are scared of him.
[00:51:05.083 --> 00:51:09.202]  Here's a few of his campaign ads that are turning heads.
[00:51:09.202 --> 00:51:15.642]   Democrats like to say that no one needs an AR-15 for self-defense, that no one could possibly
[00:51:15.642 --> 00:51:17.322]  need all 30 rounds.
[00:51:17.322 --> 00:51:19.322]  (audience cheering)
[00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:32.702]  But when this rifle is the only thing standing between your family and a dozen angry Democrats in Klan hoods, you just might need that semi-automatic in all 30 rounds.
[00:51:33.442 --> 00:51:33.963]  Beautiful!
[00:51:38.226 --> 00:51:42.188]  One of the biggest problems that many of us are facing is internet censorship.
[00:51:42.748 --> 00:51:46.650]  Millions of people are being purged from the internet for no good reason at all.
[00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:51.732]  Our elected officials have been ignoring this major issue for a long time.
[00:51:52.212 --> 00:51:57.415]  They think that since the big tech titans are private corporations, that they can do whatever they want.
[00:51:58.413 --> 00:52:01.234]  In that if we don't like it, we should start our own thing.
[00:52:01.875 --> 00:52:03.896]  That is a totally misguided approach.
[00:52:04.616 --> 00:52:10.659]  Because these tech titans are richer and more powerful than any company in the history of the world.
[00:52:11.079 --> 00:52:12.800]  They operate in every country.
[00:52:13.761 --> 00:52:16.122]  They have the power to make or break most businesses.
[00:52:17.282 --> 00:52:20.624]  To swing elections and even start wars.
[00:52:21.264 --> 00:52:24.366]  We cannot allow them to separate and divide us any longer.
[00:52:25.168 --> 00:52:26.629]  We need to level the playing field.
[00:52:27.049 --> 00:52:29.571]  It's time to call these social media companies what they are.
[00:52:30.591 --> 00:52:31.392]  Public utilities.
[00:52:31.872 --> 00:52:38.636]  Public utilities are companies that operate at a monopoly scale because they offer services that we cannot live without.
[00:52:38.876 --> 00:52:46.261]  In the same way, you cannot run a business, a non-profit, or a political campaign without electricity or a telephone.
[00:52:46.761 --> 00:52:50.622]  You can't run any of those things without social media in 2022.
[00:52:51.083 --> 00:52:53.203]  Social media is the modern-day public square.
[00:52:53.703 --> 00:52:56.404]  It is access to the market, and it is the keys to power.
[00:52:56.725 --> 00:52:58.885]  Barack Obama got elected because of social media.
[00:52:59.185 --> 00:53:01.166]  Donald Trump got elected because of social media.
[00:53:01.306 --> 00:53:11.150]  That's why the establishment spent the last six years doing everything they can to censor those who question them, whether it is Russiagate, COVID, Ukraine, or January 6th.
[00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:18.354]  They will use any excuse they can to consolidate power and to shut off anyone who opposes them.
[00:53:18.714 --> 00:53:22.977]  That's why we need to come together as Americans and put our foot down before it's too late.
[00:53:23.857 --> 00:53:24.678]  Enough is enough.
[00:53:24.978 --> 00:53:28.120]  The power company can't cut off your power because they don't like your politics.
[00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:32.122]  The phone company cannot cut off your telephone because they don't like your politics.
[00:53:32.822 --> 00:53:37.725]  So the social media companies should not be able to cancel you because they don't like your politics.
[00:53:38.366 --> 00:53:41.448]  They need to be legally classified as public utilities.
[00:53:42.088 --> 00:53:52.619]  And we need to pass an Internet Bill of Rights, one that firmly establishes our First Amendment rights into the realm of cyberspace, where we now live most of our lives.
[00:53:53.099 --> 00:53:54.421]  This is not North Korea.
[00:53:55.041 --> 00:53:56.163]  This is not China.
[00:53:56.183 --> 00:53:59.726]  This is the United States of America.
[00:54:00.603 --> 00:54:04.888]  And in this country, our right to free speech is not optional.
[00:54:05.529 --> 00:54:06.390]  I'm Jerome Davidson.
[00:54:06.711 --> 00:54:08.253]  I'm running to be your next congressman.
[00:54:08.873 --> 00:54:13.139]  I promise to fight tech tyranny every day and to bring freedom back to the internet.
[00:54:14.641 --> 00:54:17.441]  My name is Jerome Davidson and I approve this message.
[00:54:17.441 --> 00:54:20.240]  Jerome Davidson. People are really excited about this guy.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:24.400]   He's got a great record, a great history, a great Christian. I'm going to read over his bio
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:28.891]   and go to him for the next 40 minutes or so but I got to tell you they are scared of him. He's exactly
[00:54:28.891 --> 00:54:34.061]   what we need. That is the cleanest, most truthful, focused ad I've seen, period, out there. Way
[00:54:34.061 --> 00:54:38.909]   better than these veteran politicians, even some of these establishment Republicans. Jerome is a
[00:54:38.909 --> 00:54:43.901]   former Arizona State University student-athlete, NFL player who travels the country sharing
[00:54:43.901 --> 00:54:45.921]  inspiration, passion and faith.
[00:54:46.162 --> 00:54:51.265]  His unifying speeches full of truth, faith, and freedom of this country are memorable and moving.
[00:54:52.106 --> 00:54:55.207]  And we're going to go over his whole background and everything else here today.
[00:54:56.068 --> 00:54:57.749]  Jerome4Congress.com.
[00:54:57.789 --> 00:54:58.229]  Jerome.
[00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:00.411]  J-E-R-O-N-E.
[00:55:00.831 --> 00:55:05.831]  jeroenforcongress.com on Twitter for now @JeroenForCongress.
[00:55:05.831 --> 00:55:10.951]   And he joins us right now, very impressed, a lot of buzz about what he's doing.
[00:55:10.951 --> 00:55:14.831]   I've been following it for a while and we're really pleased and blessed to be able to have
[00:55:14.831 --> 00:55:16.231]  him on the show.
[00:55:16.231 --> 00:55:20.131]  Again, he's running for Congress out of Arizona.
[00:55:20.131 --> 00:55:22.791]  We just played two of his powerful campaign ads.
[00:55:22.791 --> 00:55:26.670]   Jeroen, congratulations on getting in the arena at this level.
[00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:29.431]   We really hope and pray you get into Congress because we need your leadership.
[00:55:29.431 --> 00:55:30.431]  God bless you.
[00:55:30.431 --> 00:55:35.431]  Alex Jones, thank you very much for having me on, sir.
[00:55:33.649 --> 00:55:35.651]  And they want to bring the fight to America.
[00:55:36.251 --> 00:55:44.117]  And God has touched my heart to join you and others in this country who are not going to allow these satanic, evil, pedophile people to take over this country.
[00:55:44.137 --> 00:55:44.718]  We're going to fight.
[00:55:45.398 --> 00:55:47.680]  And if God be with us, we will stand strong.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:53.725]  And I believe what has happened with the Roe v. Wade was a sign from God that his grace is still on us and he's still with us.
[00:55:53.765 --> 00:55:59.610]  So all we have to do is get some people who are bold enough, strong enough, and brave enough to stand up and fight.
[00:56:00.265 --> 00:56:00.906]  I'm excited.
[00:56:00.946 --> 00:56:01.807]  I'm excited about you.
[00:56:01.847 --> 00:56:05.271]  I'm excited about all these populist Christian candidates we're seeing.
[00:56:05.311 --> 00:56:06.553]  The system's really scared.
[00:56:07.193 --> 00:56:08.275]  I could ask a lot of questions here.
[00:56:08.295 --> 00:56:10.737]  I've got a lot of key talking points, but what's front and center for you?
[00:56:12.219 --> 00:56:15.263]  What's front and center is making sure that the border is closed.
[00:56:15.283 --> 00:56:16.084]  We've got to deal with that.
[00:56:16.104 --> 00:56:20.469]  Number two is I want to file a lawsuit against the January 6th committee.
[00:56:21.366 --> 00:56:23.808]  I don't know why we haven't had anybody do that.
[00:56:24.289 --> 00:56:25.290]  I'm going to file a lawsuit.
[00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:33.399]  I would have the jurisprudence to do that, and I would also have the jurisprudence to file a lawsuit against the jail that's housing the January 6th inmates.
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:35.261]  And so we want to get them out of here.
[00:56:35.281 --> 00:56:37.784]  That is un-American, it's evil, and it's political.
[00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:41.332]  It is, and of course you're right there in Arizona.
[00:56:42.072 --> 00:56:50.898]  I'd say it's almost as bad as Texas, but the UN, as you know, reported last week that the Texas and Arizona borders are the most dangerous land crossings in the world.
[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:53.500]  Yes.
[00:56:54.021 --> 00:56:59.625]  Oh yeah, our border crossing is crazy here, and we're surprised that Doug Ducey, well, I shouldn't say surprised.
[00:56:59.645 --> 00:57:06.990]  Doug Ducey is a black-headed punk, and he's a leftist, and he hasn't done anything to stop the border crisis, and this is why.
[00:57:07.705 --> 00:57:17.911]  I'm telling people that I go around and have these speeches with, I say, listen, y'all been my opponents and all these Republicans have nothing but a whole bunch of talking and barking dogs as long as the fence is closed.
[00:57:17.951 --> 00:57:22.975]  But as soon as the gate opens up, they tuck their tails and run to the backyard and start barking from there.
[00:57:23.515 --> 00:57:24.335]  It's time to fight now.
[00:57:24.375 --> 00:57:25.036]  So now what's up?
[00:57:25.854 --> 00:57:26.894]  You wanna, what you gonna do now?
[00:57:26.914 --> 00:57:33.797]  All this talking, they go from place to place, and from room to room, talking about everything that's happening, and complaining, and now it is time to do something.
[00:57:33.837 --> 00:57:34.717]  We need to get it done.
[00:57:34.958 --> 00:57:36.018]  They're bringing drugs in here.
[00:57:36.458 --> 00:57:49.103]  America is a criminal organization now, and one of the leading criminal organizations in the world, with sex trafficking, human trafficking, fentanyl is coming in here, and it's coming at the southern border, and Doug Ducey should have done something about it a long time ago.
[00:57:49.623 --> 00:57:55.386]  And so, I got inspired enough by the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost, got on me and stirred me.
[00:57:55.446 --> 00:58:02.570]  I was doing a YouTube channel prior to this, and I was hoping that God would just let me do the YouTube channel, but they kicked me off the YouTube channel.
[00:58:03.251 --> 00:58:07.433]  And so, therefore, I started coming up with some offensive weapons, just in case I win this congressional race.
[00:58:07.793 --> 00:58:09.114]  I'm going in on offense.
[00:58:09.214 --> 00:58:10.315]  I played fullback in the NFL.
[00:58:10.375 --> 00:58:12.136]  I don't know nothing about no defense.
[00:58:12.656 --> 00:58:17.519]  I do know that I can go in here with some offensive weapons and get them on their heels and not have us on our heels for a change.
[00:58:18.277 --> 00:58:20.079]  And with God with us, brother, we're going to get it done.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:21.280]  I totally agree.
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:24.184]  Whether you win or lose, most people have to run three times before they win.
[00:58:24.204 --> 00:58:25.024]  You've got a good chance of winning.
[00:58:25.044 --> 00:58:25.505]  It doesn't matter.
[00:58:25.945 --> 00:58:26.706]  You'll be in the debate.
[00:58:26.726 --> 00:58:27.547]  You'll be all over TV.
[00:58:27.567 --> 00:58:28.468]  You'll be getting your message out.
[00:58:28.508 --> 00:58:29.669]  You'll be doing thousands of interviews.
[00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:31.872]  People say, I'm not going to run because I don't think I'll win.
[00:58:33.053 --> 00:58:34.414]  You're never going to win if you don't try.
[00:58:34.434 --> 00:58:36.617]  I mean, it's very, very simple.
[00:58:37.924 --> 00:58:38.584]  It's very simple.
[00:58:38.624 --> 00:58:43.126]  If you don't try, and if you're not inspired enough to get out and do something, well then you're going to lose.
[00:58:43.146 --> 00:58:43.946]  You've lost already.
[00:58:43.966 --> 00:58:52.129]  You're the football champ, but what's that Vince Lombardi quote about winners never quit and quitters never win?
[00:58:53.149 --> 00:58:53.630]  Absolutely.
[00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:59.878]   And you know what he also he said, when you leave it all on the field, You have nothing to feel bad about.
[00:58:59.878 --> 00:59:03.878]   So in other words, you just said if people run and lose, they're scared they're going to lose.
[00:59:03.878 --> 00:59:08.378]   Listen, if you go out there and you give it all you have, and you give it all your energy,
[00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:12.878]   you give it all your faith and everything that you can, and you still lose,
[00:59:12.878 --> 00:59:14.878]  you don't have to walk off with your head down.
[00:59:14.752 --> 00:59:21.036]  You can walk out saying, hey, I gave it my best and maybe it just wasn't the will of God for me to have that position or to have that win.
[00:59:21.377 --> 00:59:27.781]  But at least I can lay my head on my pillow at night and say, listen, I've done what I can do and now and I can rest and I'm at peace.
[00:59:28.141 --> 00:59:34.210]   And so when I get in here, I'm going to wedge war against these evil Evil people.
[00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:37.691]  People don't understand, and this is what America needs to wake up and understand right now.
[00:59:38.012 --> 00:59:42.833]  You need to wake up right now because your sisified churches and pastors are not going to come to the rescue.
[00:59:42.853 --> 00:59:45.094]  They are not involved in this spiritual battle.
[00:59:45.754 --> 00:59:48.395]  You need to understand that evil is evil.
[00:59:49.036 --> 00:59:53.158]  And America does not understand how evil it is because they think that this is some kind of movie.
[00:59:53.559 --> 00:59:57.221]  This is a real evil takeover and they're coming to take your children from you.
[00:59:57.481 --> 01:00:00.563]  They're coming to take your wealth, your life, and everything from you right now.
[01:00:00.863 --> 01:00:04.925]  They're going to take your free speech and then they're going to take your life away and it's going to be over here in this country.
[01:00:05.325 --> 01:00:06.526]  Well, I can't imagine.
[01:00:06.546 --> 01:00:07.867]  We need you in Congress bad.
[01:00:07.887 --> 01:00:09.468]  Jerome Davidson, so excited.
[01:00:09.488 --> 01:00:10.789]  We're going to come back and talk about it.
[01:00:11.329 --> 01:00:12.710]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:14.065 --> 01:00:19.847]  Our guest, Jerome Davison, is a former star college football player, star NFL-er, who I admire.
[01:00:19.867 --> 01:00:30.132]  He's standing up for truth and freedom and traveling the country, battling the globalists in the last few years, and now throwing his hat in the ring in a highly contested congressional district in Arizona.
[01:00:30.172 --> 01:00:34.594]  He's also a pastor, and that's the most important work, in my view, that he's been doing.
[01:00:35.754 --> 01:00:41.257]  Feels like God has enlisted him, reading his campaign literature, to fight for Americans.
[01:00:41.277 --> 01:00:41.977]  And I'm very excited.
[01:00:41.997 --> 01:00:58.185]  I want to talk about the First Amendment, his introduction to the Internet Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment, his congressional district, the struggle that Arizona faces, his upcoming primary, the fact that he's a pastor, author, former NFL running back, now running for Congress to protect and ensure the freedoms of American people, are entitled to the Constitutional Bill of Rights.
[01:00:58.745 --> 01:01:01.967]  And Jerome, please, please continue with all of this.
[01:01:02.027 --> 01:01:02.687]  I want to run through it.
[01:01:02.707 --> 01:01:03.928]  But first, you talk about evil.
[01:01:05.182 --> 01:01:07.143]  We got to respond to the Hunter Biden situation.
[01:01:07.523 --> 01:01:09.584]  We go back two years ago in the middle of the campaign.
[01:01:09.844 --> 01:01:10.965]  His laptop comes out.
[01:01:11.325 --> 01:01:11.965]  He left it there.
[01:01:11.985 --> 01:01:13.046]  It was given to law enforcement.
[01:01:13.326 --> 01:01:14.506]  The whole media said it was fake.
[01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:18.548]  They censored even the President Trump, myself, everybody that tried to show it.
[01:01:18.888 --> 01:01:19.669]  It was all him.
[01:01:19.689 --> 01:01:21.630]  Now his phone has been released and hacked.
[01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:22.850]  They admit it's his.
[01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:24.131]  It's pedophilic.
[01:01:24.251 --> 01:01:25.492]  He's smoking crack.
[01:01:26.092 --> 01:01:27.272]  It's sex trafficking.
[01:01:28.613 --> 01:01:30.234]  I can't even say the stuff that's on there, folks.
[01:01:30.894 --> 01:01:32.355]  Just like the last laptop.
[01:01:32.475 --> 01:01:34.316]  Naked trophies where he's with little girls.
[01:01:34.637 --> 01:01:35.697]  Look like they're 10 years old.
[01:01:35.737 --> 01:01:38.399]  I mean, this is... I'm scared to click on it.
[01:01:38.459 --> 01:01:39.280]  I stopped this morning.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.160]  I wasn't gonna look anymore.
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.501]  I'm not even sure it's legal to look at it.
[01:01:42.342 --> 01:01:44.964]  So, I mean, how cut and dry is this?
[01:01:46.508 --> 01:01:47.069]  It's cut and dry.
[01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.629]  He's a criminal.
[01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:56.938]  Joe Biden has been compromised because we found out on the phone conversation that he did know about his son's business dealings in Ukraine and around the world.
[01:01:57.359 --> 01:02:02.264]  Those business dealings also included sex trafficking and human trafficking.
[01:02:02.724 --> 01:02:04.025]  They already know it.
[01:02:04.246 --> 01:02:07.429]  We are under the thumb of a criminal organization in the White House.
[01:02:07.949 --> 01:02:09.311]  And the FBI knew about it.
[01:02:09.511 --> 01:02:10.472]  And let me tell you something.
[01:02:11.426 --> 01:02:16.210]  I will work hard to defund the FBI, and we've got to reform it.
[01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:19.492]  Because they are an extension of the Democrat Party.
[01:02:19.873 --> 01:02:21.574]  They work against the American people.
[01:02:21.894 --> 01:02:23.395]  They're not doing anything to help us.
[01:02:23.435 --> 01:02:27.959]  They knew about these school shootings before they happened, and yet they didn't do anything about it.
[01:02:27.999 --> 01:02:35.685]  But yet, they set up, they tried to set up President Donald Trump, and they set up a phony hoax when it came down to Gretchen Whitmer's kidnapping.
[01:02:36.145 --> 01:02:38.868]  This is what we're paying the American tax dollars for?
[01:02:39.208 --> 01:02:42.251]  For an FBI agency that does nothing for the American people?
[01:02:42.611 --> 01:02:44.493]  We have got to change this whole scenario.
[01:02:45.053 --> 01:02:49.517]  One thing I'm going to do and go in there with my Internet Bill of Rights, which is going to include data recovery.
[01:02:50.038 --> 01:02:55.303]  These people are spying on us and they're making trillions of dollars off of our data and off of our information.
[01:02:55.923 --> 01:03:06.532]  And my Internet Bill of Rights is not only going to stop censorship and stop them from listening to our stuff and stopping us from getting kicked off these platforms like you, Mr. Alex Jones, and all of the great work that you've been doing.
[01:03:06.572 --> 01:03:14.558]  To me, you have done more spiritual work in the Kingdom of God than most churches and pastors in this world, in this country.
[01:03:14.838 --> 01:03:15.839]  And I'm going to tell you something.
[01:03:15.899 --> 01:03:18.601]  When they censor us, we're not going to be able to preach the gospel.
[01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:24.207]  We're not going to be able to say anything about Jesus Christ and God and a boy being a boy and a girl being a girl.
[01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:30.492]  And I want you Christians out there to wake up and understand that God wants you to be the light of the world and the salt of the earth.
[01:03:30.813 --> 01:03:34.376]  And that means you got to come in opposition to darkness and everything that's not of God.
[01:03:34.856 --> 01:03:35.957]  We're going to do data recovery.
[01:03:35.977 --> 01:03:38.500]  That is, you have old folks right now living on a limited budget.
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:43.723]  And while they're searching their phones and doing everything, the data is being stolen and stolen around the world.
[01:03:44.063 --> 01:03:48.305]  Trillions of dollars of data that feeds the algorithm.
[01:03:48.345 --> 01:03:50.267]  The algorithm needs this information.
[01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:57.911]  And so, in my Internet Bill of Rights, I want people to either be paid for the data that's being stolen from them, or either opt out.
[01:03:58.491 --> 01:04:14.298]  The other thing is that emerging technologies, you saw in that COVID bill, that the left slid in there that they will have a mind-reading technology in these new cars that reads your emotions and reads your mind.
[01:04:14.318 --> 01:04:16.139]  By the way, that's not a joke.
[01:04:16.199 --> 01:04:17.199]  That's law now.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:23.962]  Within three years, they scan you, breathalyze you, and then have a computer analyze if you're in a good frame of mind.
[01:04:24.002 --> 01:04:25.263]  They can set that any way they want.
[01:04:25.583 --> 01:04:27.664]  That's what the Communist Party of China has already put in.
[01:04:29.586 --> 01:04:32.390]  I am going to block that because your mind is sovereign property.
[01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:36.716]  And when they did the forced inoculation, Alex, they did the forced inoculation.
[01:04:36.736 --> 01:04:41.903]  They were basically telling Americans that your body is the property of the government.
[01:04:41.923 --> 01:04:43.405]  And everybody should have been fighting against that.
[01:04:43.425 --> 01:04:44.387]  That's right.
[01:04:44.407 --> 01:04:46.029]  Total violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[01:04:46.846 --> 01:04:47.506]  There you go.
[01:04:48.247 --> 01:04:52.088]  And they're doing it now with the mind, and that's my Internet Bill of Rights.
[01:04:52.168 --> 01:04:59.692]  It's a three-pronged bill that's going to stop censorship, recover data, and also stop the emerging technologies that's going to take over the world.
[01:05:00.352 --> 01:05:07.135]  You know, usually we get even great candidates on, people that have won, and they're just basically putting out conservative talking points, and that's great.
[01:05:07.795 --> 01:05:08.616]  Populous talking points.
[01:05:08.636 --> 01:05:14.719]  But man, you've got a better plan than even members of Congress that are good, like Josh Hawley and so many others.
[01:05:15.939 --> 01:05:22.484]  You're obviously a smart guy and have been out traveling the country and been doing your own news show for a while, but how did you come up with such a great plan?
[01:05:22.504 --> 01:05:23.565]  Because I totally agree with it.
[01:05:25.046 --> 01:05:26.988]  Well, I listen to a lot of young people.
[01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:36.075]  I'm at ASU campus all the time and then I have some young people around me, even in my camp right now, that's helping me deal with this emerging technologies and all this talking points.
[01:05:36.496 --> 01:05:40.519]  But I've been watching the moves of the globalists and also I watch your show.
[01:05:41.318 --> 01:05:46.540]  And you've been ahead of the game, man, and really helping us with our talking points and coming up with a battle plan.
[01:05:47.721 --> 01:05:52.062]  Instead of just wanting to go in Congress and just, you know, just for the sake of ego, it's time out for that.
[01:05:52.543 --> 01:05:58.885]  We are at war, and this war, our greatest threat is not China and it's not anything from the outside.
[01:05:58.925 --> 01:06:03.107]  Our greatest threat is domestic on this terra firma right now in America.
[01:06:03.487 --> 01:06:17.519]   We have leftists and a criminal organization in this country right now, and if we don't wake up right now and start funding People like myself who are running for office and get me in there so I can go to war and help stop this stuff.
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:19.000]  Our country is over.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.182]  Well, I'm 100% sold and I'm going to get behind what you're doing.
[01:06:23.342 --> 01:06:26.983]  Everybody needs to go to your website, jeromeforcongress.com.
[01:06:27.643 --> 01:06:32.465]  I want to get into more of your platform next segment, but Jerome, tell people how they can get in the fight right now.
[01:06:32.825 --> 01:06:33.986]  Everybody's got to get behind you.
[01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:36.618]  Go to JeromeForCongress.com.
[01:06:36.678 --> 01:06:37.998]  Go to Get Involved.
[01:06:38.499 --> 01:06:44.602]  I'm raising up an army of 2,000 to 4,000 people that are going to knock doors, make phone calls, share my content, make memes.
[01:06:44.762 --> 01:06:47.363]  Memes are very important right now, and they're very powerful.
[01:06:47.423 --> 01:06:48.264]  Make fun of the left.
[01:06:48.584 --> 01:06:49.104]  Laugh at them.
[01:06:49.164 --> 01:06:49.884]  Make jokes at them.
[01:06:50.205 --> 01:06:51.505]  Take my video and share it.
[01:06:51.545 --> 01:06:52.286]  Make a meme of it.
[01:06:52.626 --> 01:06:54.667]  We are going to go after them, and we're going to wear them out.
[01:06:54.707 --> 01:06:57.968]  They don't have a sense of humor, and laughter really hurts their spirits.
[01:06:57.988 --> 01:06:58.909]  So let's laugh at them.
[01:06:59.369 --> 01:07:00.410]  And share this content.
[01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:03.251]  Send $5, $10 to my campaign.
[01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:04.132]  Send $20.
[01:07:04.452 --> 01:07:07.654]  Tell people to donate because the GOP isn't funding me.
[01:07:07.894 --> 01:07:08.735]  They're not helping me.
[01:07:09.675 --> 01:07:14.398]  I'm maxed out, but I'm going to make the maximum donation I can make.
[01:07:14.418 --> 01:07:14.698]  What is that? $3,000?
[01:07:16.658 --> 01:07:19.420]  You're going to have to go up, Alex.
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:20.640]  I think it's like 58.
[01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:23.942]  I haven't checked in a while.
[01:07:23.962 --> 01:07:24.562]  Well, that's good.
[01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:29.985]  I'm going to make a donation 100% today to the campaign because, I mean, we've got to be all in here.
[01:07:30.005 --> 01:07:30.325]  You're right.
[01:07:30.806 --> 01:07:34.387]  People will just realize you've got to spend your money to save your money.
[01:07:34.748 --> 01:07:36.969]  Americans have to realize this is a total war.
[01:07:38.664 --> 01:07:38.964]  Amen.
[01:07:39.084 --> 01:07:40.325]  This is a complete war.
[01:07:41.705 --> 01:07:45.047]  The spirit that was with God, he saw God, he was created by God.
[01:07:45.307 --> 01:07:48.188]  He watched God make the stars and the planets and everything.
[01:07:48.528 --> 01:07:53.830]  And the Bible says in Job that they rejoiced when God made all of these things and he was the sovereign Elohim.
[01:07:54.671 --> 01:07:59.993]  But these spirits were with the God and saw him and knew him as God, but yet rebelled against him.
[01:08:00.649 --> 01:08:01.150]  What do you think?
[01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:05.016]  That evil just stayed in heaven or was just between the pages of Genesis and Exodus?
[01:08:05.516 --> 01:08:10.744]  That evil is prevalent today and it's in the Democrat Party and we have to stop them right now.
[01:08:11.665 --> 01:08:12.086]  You're right.
[01:08:12.106 --> 01:08:13.348]  I mean, they're at war with us.
[01:08:13.368 --> 01:08:14.269]  They admit they're at war.
[01:08:14.329 --> 01:08:15.491]  They are just shutting everything down.
[01:08:16.866 --> 01:08:24.412]  When they told the churches not to say hallelujah or sing loud, I thought for sure that the church was going to say, hey, listen, don't you tell me how to sing.
[01:08:24.432 --> 01:08:25.333]  Let's talk about that.
[01:08:25.433 --> 01:08:29.136]  In Canada, in California, in New York, all over the world, they said, don't sing.
[01:08:29.176 --> 01:08:30.337]  You can go to church, don't sing.
[01:08:30.638 --> 01:08:31.779]  They want total control.
[01:08:31.819 --> 01:08:33.800]  They're scared of the brethren coming together.
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:34.801]  Stay right there, sir.
[01:08:34.821 --> 01:08:35.622]  We've got to get you.
[01:08:36.082 --> 01:08:38.684]  So there are several big phenomenons here we need to cover.
[01:08:38.704 --> 01:08:42.206]  The worst part of my job is that I have to study these evil people, and I'm not perfect.
[01:08:42.226 --> 01:08:43.827]  Like, I want to get in fights.
[01:08:43.646 --> 01:08:44.646]  ForCongress.com.
[01:08:44.646 --> 01:08:45.646]  J-E-R-O-N-E.
[01:08:45.646 --> 01:08:46.646]  JeromeForCongress.com.
[01:08:46.646 --> 01:08:50.287]  I'm Alex Jones with themfullwars.com.
[01:08:50.287 --> 01:08:51.287]  Stay with us.
[01:08:51.287 --> 01:08:55.565]  So, there are several big phenomenons here we need to cover.
[01:08:55.565 --> 01:09:00.166]   The worst part of my job is that I have to study these evil people, and I'm not perfect.
[01:09:00.166 --> 01:09:02.926]  Like, I want to get in fights.
[01:09:02.926 --> 01:09:05.726]  I lust after women.
[01:09:05.726 --> 01:09:06.726]  I'm not perfect.
[01:09:06.726 --> 01:09:09.247]  But I love God, and I love justice, and I love everybody.
[01:09:09.885 --> 01:09:14.032]  And I hate having to study these evil people because I can't stand them.
[01:09:15.217 --> 01:09:21.300]  But the great part is I get to meet all the really wonderful people that love God and justice and how alive they are.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:25.421]  No matter what color they are, where they came from, if they love God and justice, you just see it.
[01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:29.083]  The people that serve evil look like zombies or something.
[01:09:29.103 --> 01:09:30.703]  It's scary and I don't want to be like them.
[01:09:31.023 --> 01:09:33.945]  And I want to protect the children, the unborn and the born from them.
[01:09:34.205 --> 01:09:35.285]  And they're coming after it all.
[01:09:35.885 --> 01:09:37.006]  There's another paradox here.
[01:09:38.579 --> 01:09:48.586]  So many people say, I don't care what's happening in the Netherlands, I don't care what's happening in Canada, I don't care what's happening in Arizona, because you live in New York, you live in Texas, folks.
[01:09:49.247 --> 01:09:56.131]  If somebody's having their rights taken in Australia, or in Nigeria, or in Mexico, it affects you.
[01:09:56.532 --> 01:09:59.494]  If Bolsonaro's fighting tyranny in Brazil, that helps you.
[01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:01.491]  I know our audience gets that.
[01:10:01.511 --> 01:10:02.132]  It has empathy.
[01:10:02.152 --> 01:10:03.294]  You don't need to be told that.
[01:10:03.334 --> 01:10:05.937]  You already have it ingrained in your spirit to care about others.
[01:10:06.778 --> 01:10:11.804]  It's not even scientific to understand, but it is scientific that if others are in trouble, you're going to end up in trouble.
[01:10:12.145 --> 01:10:15.929]  If other people can be enslaved or dominated or abused, you can be.
[01:10:17.031 --> 01:10:17.672]  But I got to tell you.
[01:10:19.082 --> 01:10:25.787]  It doesn't matter where you are in the world, we're fighting a global corporate satanic force of the Great Reset and the Davos Group, the Bilderberg Group.
[01:10:26.528 --> 01:10:28.730]  And we need to get behind the fight against it.
[01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:33.974]  And we need people that are in office and running for office, whether it's local, state, or federal, or international.
[01:10:35.103 --> 01:10:37.066]  To talk about it and make it the central issue.
[01:10:37.086 --> 01:10:45.016]  And what I love about our guest, Jerome Davison, at JeromeForCongress.com, is he gets that, and you can tell.
[01:10:45.036 --> 01:10:48.641]  If you don't know about this stuff, you can't explain it to people.
[01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:49.763]  He knows what he's talking about.
[01:10:49.783 --> 01:10:52.386]  And I gotta tell you, he's better right now.
[01:10:53.547 --> 01:11:00.810]  Then Rand Paul and Josh Hawley and people that are good people I know but don't go all the way because he has the courage to say it.
[01:11:00.970 --> 01:11:03.171]  I know they know all this and they're starting to get there.
[01:11:03.231 --> 01:11:04.171]  So is Tucker Carlson.
[01:11:04.432 --> 01:11:05.912]  We got to get there last year.
[01:11:06.472 --> 01:11:10.174]  We don't have time to play games in a war with an enemy with a playbook.
[01:11:10.234 --> 01:11:11.114]  Use a football analogy.
[01:11:11.394 --> 01:11:16.196]  We know their playbook is total destruction, total enslavement, cutting off the energy, brainwashing our children.
[01:11:16.577 --> 01:11:19.598]   There is no Making a deal with that, there's no backing down.
[01:11:19.858 --> 01:11:23.620]  Just because the enemy's so crazy, we can't sound crazy by saying what they're doing.
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:24.700]  They're doing this.
[01:11:24.941 --> 01:11:26.001]  Hunter Biden's doing this.
[01:11:26.401 --> 01:11:27.642]  Jeffrey Epstein's doing this.
[01:11:27.962 --> 01:11:29.023]  These people are doing this.
[01:11:29.083 --> 01:11:35.266]  So, they're bad and we gotta up our game and just lay it out like it is and not be afraid of how crazy it sounds.
[01:11:35.526 --> 01:11:39.348]  We're not crazy because they're fulfilling the Book of Revelation and they're satanic.
[01:11:39.648 --> 01:11:40.568]  They're the crazy ones.
[01:11:41.008 --> 01:11:46.051]  But good people get hit with something so evil, so out of control, you just kind of shut down.
[01:11:47.349 --> 01:11:48.269]  But we can't shut down.
[01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:50.090]  But I understand the paradox.
[01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:53.992]  I had to stop looking at the Hunter Biden phone today because I was like, this has got to be illegal.
[01:11:54.012 --> 01:11:55.092]  I've never seen child porn.
[01:11:55.112 --> 01:11:55.953]  I'm not about to see it.
[01:11:56.173 --> 01:11:58.494]  And it was going in that direction, him in bed with kids, you name it.
[01:11:59.034 --> 01:12:02.235]  So I understand the paradox of not wanting to look at this.
[01:12:03.056 --> 01:12:11.159]  But as a pastor and as a really smart man, how do you thread the needle of spending our time on good people and why God's great versus exposing the evil?
[01:12:11.359 --> 01:12:17.063]   Because there's almost at a certain point, You stare into the abyss, you become the abyss.
[01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:22.415]  But what I'm getting at here is I appreciate your courage in coming right out with who the enemy is.
[01:12:24.818 --> 01:12:30.879]  Yeah, well, we can look in the face of God and we see God and we see his glory compared to man and compared to the evil.
[01:12:31.539 --> 01:12:36.820]  Well, then I can face anything because I know that God is much greater than all of these evils, but I see their atrocities.
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:37.660]  I see their evil.
[01:12:38.321 --> 01:12:41.921]  I see the type of evil that's coming up on this country, and it's not going to be fun.
[01:12:41.961 --> 01:12:43.862]  It's not going to be a comic movie.
[01:12:44.322 --> 01:12:47.062]  It's not going to be something that you think is just going to go away.
[01:12:47.082 --> 01:12:51.603]  It is going to be permanent hell on earth, and we've already read about it in the book of Revelation.
[01:12:52.342 --> 01:12:56.966]  And but the church don't even they preach it as if it's just going to stay in the pages of the Bible.
[01:12:57.426 --> 01:13:01.029]  But this evil is coming and we've got to prepare our people for it.
[01:13:01.469 --> 01:13:05.993]  And so when I look at the evils and things that Hunter Biden is doing, I don't enjoy it.
[01:13:06.913 --> 01:13:07.774]  It makes me sick.
[01:13:07.834 --> 01:13:09.395]  It makes me it makes me very upset.
[01:13:09.816 --> 01:13:12.798]  And it makes me want to put people like him in jail forever.
[01:13:14.341 --> 01:13:14.942]  Absolutely.
[01:13:15.702 --> 01:13:21.007]  The paradox I was getting at is, how do we expose it when we can't even show it on TV?
[01:13:21.688 --> 01:13:23.429]  But then people don't know what's happening.
[01:13:23.569 --> 01:13:25.851]  That's really where I have a paradox.
[01:13:25.871 --> 01:13:31.997]  Because I'm normally very decisive, but if I don't want to look at something, how am I supposed to put it on TV?
[01:13:32.017 --> 01:13:33.338]  But at a certain point, we're going to have to.
[01:13:34.884 --> 01:13:43.571]  We're going to have to bring it on TV, we're going to have to bring it for the American people, and this is why I need to get in Congress, because I want to bring these people before, all of this stuff, before the American people, and I want to expose it.
[01:13:44.152 --> 01:13:52.699]  No longer are they going to be able to hide behind race, or by calling somebody who's white in Congress that you're racist when you want to expose the darkness of the dark side.
[01:13:52.799 --> 01:13:55.461]  I'm black, and I'm not going to let you push me around.
[01:13:55.481 --> 01:13:59.964]  They told me that once I win my primary, that they're going to send Washington down and teach me how to walk.
[01:14:00.185 --> 01:14:00.745]  No, you're not.
[01:14:00.765 --> 01:14:05.169]   You send anybody here, All of them are going to go back to Washington with my foot up their rear end.
[01:14:05.509 --> 01:14:07.530]  I'm not going to Washington to be one of these people.
[01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:13.015]  I've got to go in here and help save the American people from the evil that I see coming upon them, and we will expose it.
[01:14:13.535 --> 01:14:16.497]  Now, I don't need the media, the Markenburg media.
[01:14:16.718 --> 01:14:22.222]  I'm going to take my own media team with me to Congress, and we're going to have our own shows, and we will expose it.
[01:14:22.262 --> 01:14:22.622]  Trust that.
[01:14:23.503 --> 01:14:24.023]  It's beautiful.
[01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:26.145]  Who is your favorite member of Congress right now?
[01:14:26.205 --> 01:14:27.586]  I mean, I think MTG's great.
[01:14:28.067 --> 01:14:29.067]  Jim Jordan's great.
[01:14:29.588 --> 01:14:30.068]  Who do you think?
[01:14:30.088 --> 01:14:31.029]  Jim Jordan's great.
[01:14:31.681 --> 01:14:32.842]  Jim Jordan is wonderful.
[01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:35.263]  Marjorie Taylor Greene is a great fighter.
[01:14:35.624 --> 01:14:37.925]  She just needs somebody that's going to help her fight.
[01:14:38.325 --> 01:14:40.647]  I think she's the toughest fighter that we have in Congress.
[01:14:41.367 --> 01:14:41.668]  I agree.
[01:14:41.688 --> 01:14:43.889]  She's fearless and has her own pro-America agenda.
[01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:46.791]  Yes, she does.
[01:14:47.311 --> 01:14:49.233]  She really does, and I really appreciate that.
[01:14:49.253 --> 01:14:50.353]  Well, I can just tell you this.
[01:14:50.734 --> 01:14:51.154]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:14:52.594 --> 01:14:54.836]  I just wish we had more people that's in there fighting with her.
[01:14:55.416 --> 01:14:56.678]  I just wish that we had more people.
[01:14:56.698 --> 01:15:09.849]  And another thing that I'm going to do in Congress, and I know you was on this for a minute, but we got to talk about this WikiLeaks and the truth behind the WikiLeaks, because what the media did is that they went over to talking about Julian Assange and the stuff being stolen.
[01:15:09.889 --> 01:15:10.669]  It wasn't stolen.
[01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:19.377]  But this is the truth behind our CIA and FBI and this corporation called America, and we're going to have to expose it.
[01:15:20.336 --> 01:15:28.201]  I totally agree, but at a certain point, that civil disobedience, I'm not for stealing from innocent people, but we stole Hitler's codes in World War II to defeat him.
[01:15:28.621 --> 01:15:38.468]  I mean, at a certain point, whoever stole the codes or whoever broke into Hunter's iPhone and exposed pedophilia, I say more power to him!
[01:15:39.688 --> 01:15:40.068]  Exactly.
[01:15:40.108 --> 01:15:40.889]  They shouldn't be arrested.
[01:15:40.909 --> 01:15:42.771]  They shouldn't be treated like that.
[01:15:42.851 --> 01:15:46.093]  I mean, whatever the justice system have to do to deal with that, deal with that.
[01:15:46.554 --> 01:15:48.796]  But at least some truth has been extracted from it.
[01:15:49.036 --> 01:15:50.997]  We see that this man is harming little children.
[01:15:51.358 --> 01:16:03.708]  We see that this man is having illegal guns, that he's doing terrible things, and he's compromised America because of his crimes and ties to China and enemies of our nation.
[01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:13.278]  I want to come back and talk about big picture and what you think is going to happen in the midterms and the rest of it, but let's spend a few minutes with listeners right now as I made that point coming into the segment.
[01:16:13.898 --> 01:16:19.280]  Folks, it doesn't matter if you live in Delaware or Florida or Washington State or Texas or Michigan.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.381]  Arizona is a key battleground.
[01:16:21.441 --> 01:16:22.242]  Every state's important.
[01:16:22.282 --> 01:16:23.463]  We need to get this guy in.
[01:16:23.803 --> 01:16:30.889]  If you think MTG scares them, you don't need me to tell you folks that this guy in Congress would be a wrecking ball to folks.
[01:16:31.269 --> 01:16:36.353]  So what do we do, again, to really energize your campaign and make sure you win?
[01:16:38.061 --> 01:16:45.483]  Tell everybody in Arizona, in my Congress, Tempe, Mesa, Ahwatuke, and Chandler that they need to vote for me by August 2nd.
[01:16:45.543 --> 01:16:46.603]  That's the end of the primary.
[01:16:46.703 --> 01:16:47.283]  I need to get in.
[01:16:47.363 --> 01:16:48.123]  I need people to vote.
[01:16:48.443 --> 01:16:50.064]  I need people to donate to my campaign.
[01:16:50.184 --> 01:16:53.244]  I've raised the least money in this campaign, but I've done more with a dollar.
[01:16:53.625 --> 01:16:54.865]  I have made a dollar holler.
[01:16:54.945 --> 01:16:59.626]  I have stretched the dollar compared to my opponents raising all these hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:17:00.126 --> 01:17:05.290]  But I have a message and message is very important with motivating and inspiring people.
[01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:06.551]  And so that's what I have done.
[01:17:07.252 --> 01:17:12.556]  But I need you to go there and maybe come in town and help us knock on doors, make phone calls, share my information.
[01:17:12.596 --> 01:17:13.717]  I call it the passing game.
[01:17:13.757 --> 01:17:19.762]  Even though you may not be in the state, just pass the football, pass my information, take my video and share it everywhere.
[01:17:20.142 --> 01:17:21.083]  Tell people that I'm here.
[01:17:21.443 --> 01:17:24.267]  Oh listen, George Soros and the left, they're involved in foreign countries.
[01:17:24.287 --> 01:17:25.288]  They're involved in every race.
[01:17:25.688 --> 01:17:28.151]  But conservatives go, well that's not my state, I'm not going to get involved.
[01:17:28.352 --> 01:17:30.094]  Because conservatives don't want to get in somebody's business.
[01:17:30.354 --> 01:17:33.358]  You're not getting in Arizona's business, folks, going there and helping this guy get elected.
[01:17:34.989 --> 01:17:35.389]  That's right.
[01:17:35.869 --> 01:17:39.791]  So yeah, don't think that, I mean, social media has tied us all together.
[01:17:39.831 --> 01:17:48.275]  It's very easy to take my information and share it and get involved, because I'm going to be a representative for the whole United States, and I'm going to help fight for our freedoms.
[01:17:48.315 --> 01:17:52.037]  With my Internet Bill of Rights, we're going to bring these people to justice, and we will fight.
[01:17:52.177 --> 01:17:53.417]  I will fight for you, America.
[01:17:53.757 --> 01:17:54.538]  Jerome, beautiful.
[01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:57.999]  I got a lot of questions, but the final segment, what else do you want to hit coming up?
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:10.882]   Well, I want to talk about getting the churches involved in waking these pastors up, and I want to talk about My Internet Bill of Rights a little further, and how people can look for that and expose it.
[01:18:10.983 --> 01:18:11.883]  Beautiful, absolutely.
[01:18:11.903 --> 01:18:14.604]  It was the pastors that helped start the Revolutionary War.
[01:18:15.325 --> 01:18:18.966]  It was the pastors throughout history that confronted evil, and where are they today?
[01:18:19.366 --> 01:18:20.447]  Most of them are a bunch of cowards.
[01:18:21.367 --> 01:18:22.768]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:18:23.028 --> 01:18:27.870]  In the third hour, I'm going to take your calls and hit a bunch of the news and more on the Hunter iPhone.
[01:18:29.946 --> 01:18:50.152]   Jerome Davison, running for Congress in Arizona, is our guest, and he wants to get into the Internet Bill of Rights and more here in closing, but I wanted to bring up the anti-KKK ad he ran, because to me, the Achilles heel The Democrats is the fact that they constantly run around calling everybody racist for no reason when they are the party of slavery.
[01:18:50.192 --> 01:18:51.673]  They are the party of the KKK.
[01:18:51.954 --> 01:18:56.457]  The NRA was founded to train black folks and northerners how to shoot after the Civil War.
[01:18:56.857 --> 01:18:59.599]  And then I see black leaders going, oh, the NRA is the KKK.
[01:19:00.299 --> 01:19:02.861]  And I just love calling them on that.
[01:19:03.421 --> 01:19:04.362]  And it's so exciting.
[01:19:04.402 --> 01:19:10.786]  I don't care if you're a woman, a man, black, white, Asian, Hispanic, you're running for Congress and you love freedom, I'll vote for you.
[01:19:12.571 --> 01:19:15.633]  But at the same time, they try to make all the politics racial.
[01:19:15.794 --> 01:19:25.121]  I love seeing this awesome crop of badass black people running everywhere and winning, and the rhetoric is just the best that's out there.
[01:19:25.161 --> 01:19:26.102]  The truth is out there.
[01:19:26.542 --> 01:19:32.021]   It scares them double, as you know, black folks voted for Trump, that voted for a Republican.
[01:19:32.021 --> 01:19:37.342]   It's so exciting and it scares them to death because they call MTG the Klan mother with
[01:19:37.342 --> 01:19:42.042]   no evidence when they're the ones that are up to their eyeballs in the KKK.
[01:19:42.042 --> 01:19:45.421]   And then all of Joe Biden's history, Judge Joe Brown exposed having a meeting with him
[01:19:45.421 --> 01:19:47.862]  back when he was in the federal government.
[01:19:47.862 --> 01:19:50.182]   And he was literally calling black people N-words right in front of him.
[01:19:50.188 --> 01:19:55.189]  I mean, these are crazy people that use race for control, and it's just sick.
[01:19:55.229 --> 01:20:04.251]  So, can you speak, and we'll roll the b-roll over for people that just joined us, to this powerful Second Amendment ad you created, exposing the KKK.
[01:20:05.871 --> 01:20:10.813]  Yes, well, they're telling us, they tell us that white supremacy is the greatest threat to America.
[01:20:11.693 --> 01:20:16.814]  And if it's a great threat, a greatest threat, well then my video puts them in a terrible conundrum, right?
[01:20:17.702 --> 01:20:23.748]  Because you should be telling black people to arm yourselves with AR-15s because of this great threat.
[01:20:24.549 --> 01:20:35.679]  But when they attack my ad, we can see the hoods coming on the Democrat Party because they start attacking me because they don't want me to tell black people and remind black people the history of the Democrat Party.
[01:20:35.759 --> 01:20:36.861]  They're the party of the KKK.
[01:20:37.862 --> 01:20:46.728]  When we got the right to vote, they started to send in the KKK and to threaten us and to make sure that we didn't get rights to arm ourselves with the Second Amendment.
[01:20:47.328 --> 01:20:59.956]  They also taught the black community to hate Brother Malcolm X and to love and embrace Martin Luther King, which is a wonderful thing, but they didn't want Malcolm X to be embraced because Malcolm X taught us the power of the Second Amendment.
[01:21:00.596 --> 01:21:09.719]  And I didn't realize that until later on in my adulthood that Malcolm X was a very enlightened, well moral man compared to the morals of Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:21:10.419 --> 01:21:21.563]  But America deserves a right and has a right to arm themselves and I think something great and terrible is coming because the IRS is trying to buy up all the weapons to make sure that we don't have a right to arm ourselves.
[01:21:21.583 --> 01:21:22.343]  This is ridiculous.
[01:21:23.124 --> 01:21:25.685]  It is ridiculous and it just throws it right in their face.
[01:21:25.705 --> 01:21:26.845]  We got to get you in Congress.
[01:21:26.865 --> 01:21:29.806]  All right, you want to get back into your Internet Bill of Rights because that's a big deal.
[01:21:31.747 --> 01:21:36.711]  The Internet Bill of Rights is also going to stop the social scoring.
[01:21:37.191 --> 01:21:38.992]  We see it already happening in China.
[01:21:39.533 --> 01:21:41.574]  We see it happening in Australia.
[01:21:41.975 --> 01:21:43.876]  And it's already beginning to happen in Canada.
[01:21:43.936 --> 01:21:45.277]  I mean, it's happening all around us.
[01:21:45.857 --> 01:21:48.840]  And once they digitize this, they're going to digitize money.
[01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:51.001]  This is the whole game plan.
[01:21:51.021 --> 01:21:52.282]  That's why what you're doing is so important.
[01:21:52.302 --> 01:21:52.682]  Exactly.
[01:21:52.722 --> 01:21:53.463]  It's the whole game plan.
[01:21:54.332 --> 01:21:56.093]  Well, see, the GOP is just old school.
[01:21:56.393 --> 01:21:59.073]  And they just sit here and wait for somebody to score on them.
[01:21:59.113 --> 01:22:01.094]  They're on the heels playing defense the whole time.
[01:22:01.474 --> 01:22:03.195]  You never see them playing offense.
[01:22:03.495 --> 01:22:06.476]  Let me interrupt you because I was about to say that earlier.
[01:22:06.996 --> 01:22:10.497]  Your game plan is exactly what I would come up with or even better.
[01:22:10.517 --> 01:22:11.717]  That's why I'm literally enamored.
[01:22:12.258 --> 01:22:16.379]  I love it because we need to get on offense instead of just waiting until they attack us.
[01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:18.780]  Trump should be running ads like yours.
[01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:22.061]  Everybody should be doing what you're doing is over the target.
[01:22:22.081 --> 01:22:23.341]  That's what makes me so angry.
[01:22:24.511 --> 01:22:26.172]  I'm going to teach the GOP how to win.
[01:22:26.192 --> 01:22:31.333]  I'm going to teach them how to put together a game plan and to be bold and go after these demonic evil people.
[01:22:31.674 --> 01:22:32.814]  Stop trying to play nice.
[01:22:33.374 --> 01:22:39.736]  Stop pretending like this is the way to love everybody is to let them turn your boys into girls with a sex change without your permission.
[01:22:40.017 --> 01:22:41.217]  That's not loving nobody.
[01:22:42.293 --> 01:22:44.074]  These people hate you and they hate your children.
[01:22:44.475 --> 01:22:45.515]  They hate humanity.
[01:22:45.555 --> 01:22:46.376]  They don't like you.
[01:22:46.756 --> 01:22:47.717]  They hate the way you smell.
[01:22:47.757 --> 01:22:48.597]  They hate the way you think.
[01:22:48.637 --> 01:22:49.678]  They don't want your thoughts.
[01:22:49.718 --> 01:22:50.959]  They want to give you your thoughts.
[01:22:51.539 --> 01:22:57.823]  We are not going to let these people take us, take away our rights, and we're going to teach you how to fight and how to win against these globalists.
[01:22:57.883 --> 01:23:03.227]  And when we get our country back, I want everybody to be prepared to teach your children the Constitution.
[01:23:03.507 --> 01:23:07.610]  Teach them the power of calling on the name of God in the name of Jesus and being filled with the Holy Spirit.
[01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:11.312]  Teach them to read the Bible and to turn these TVs and stuff off.
[01:23:12.293 --> 01:23:14.254]  Well, I'm on board.
[01:23:14.334 --> 01:23:15.455]  Please come on the other shows.
[01:23:15.975 --> 01:23:19.978]  Come back on and whether you win this primary or not, we're going to back you for office.
[01:23:19.998 --> 01:23:21.439]  We need to get you in there.
[01:23:21.699 --> 01:23:23.140]  I've seen a lot of great people.
[01:23:24.401 --> 01:23:26.202]  And I'm telling you, we got to get you in there.
[01:23:26.222 --> 01:23:27.422]  There's, man, amazing.
[01:23:27.823 --> 01:23:28.683]  We got about two minutes left.
[01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:29.644]  What else would you like to answer?
[01:23:30.484 --> 01:23:34.487]  Alex Jones, sir, I pray for you and I thank God for you so much, man.
[01:23:34.527 --> 01:23:37.829]  You are a powerful, powerful instrument of God.
[01:23:38.530 --> 01:23:50.155]  I know people say they have flaws and stuff, but like I said with President Donald Trump, I believe the hand of God was on President Donald Trump to save this country and to spare us from the evil which was Hillary Clinton.
[01:23:50.175 --> 01:23:58.938]  She was a witch, she was demonic, and the evils and atrocities that we see coming up on us, inflation and food shortages and all the stuff that's happening, it would have been worse.
[01:23:58.978 --> 01:24:01.179]  It would have been ten times worse if she had gotten in there.
[01:24:01.679 --> 01:24:04.923]  And President Donald Trump has got to wake up and learn how to fight with me.
[01:24:04.983 --> 01:24:05.764]  I haven't heard from him.
[01:24:05.824 --> 01:24:07.506]  I just met with General Michael Flynn.
[01:24:07.906 --> 01:24:09.028]  He's excited about my ad.
[01:24:09.068 --> 01:24:10.669]  He couldn't stop talking about my ad.
[01:24:10.689 --> 01:24:12.091]  He really enjoyed it.
[01:24:12.451 --> 01:24:13.833]  Well, hey, listen, you're general, man.
[01:24:13.853 --> 01:24:18.698]  We got to put some people together and teach people how to fight and stop all this bowing down in front of folks.
[01:24:18.919 --> 01:24:20.801]  We're not bowing down in front of nobody but God.
[01:24:22.367 --> 01:24:23.107]  Amen to that.
[01:24:23.287 --> 01:24:23.747]  All right.
[01:24:23.848 --> 01:24:25.808]  Everybody needs to mark it down and share it.
[01:24:26.568 --> 01:24:32.550]  And if you live in Arizona particularly or nearby, you need to get there and knock on doors with Jerome4Congress.com.
[01:24:33.170 --> 01:24:35.891]  He is running for Congress right now.
[01:24:35.911 --> 01:24:38.192]  You want to take action, folks, this is how you do it.
[01:24:38.772 --> 01:24:41.273]  Jerome Davidson, thank you so much, sir, and God bless you.
[01:24:43.174 --> 01:24:44.154]  Thank you so much, Alex Jones.
[01:24:46.007 --> 01:24:47.948]  The best part of my job is getting to meet people like that.
[01:24:47.968 --> 01:24:49.589]  There's gonna be more and more of them.
[01:24:49.929 --> 01:24:50.870]  And the enemy's scared.
[01:24:50.890 --> 01:24:58.374]  Because God laid it on my heart many years ago that my job is to find the leaders.
[01:24:59.215 --> 01:25:02.457]  And my job is to build a platform to boost them.
[01:25:02.917 --> 01:25:03.818]  And we've done that a lot.
[01:25:03.838 --> 01:25:05.259]  And we have changed Joe Rogan's mind.
[01:25:05.719 --> 01:25:06.940]  And Tucker Carlson's mind.
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:08.901]  And they've told me I help wake them up.
[01:25:08.921 --> 01:25:10.502]  I'm not bragging, it's just true.
[01:25:11.022 --> 01:25:20.230]   But it's only you, the listeners, boosting us And getting behind us, that has allowed all this to happen.
[01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:25.252]  So when I tell you, and I want you to listen to me very carefully right now, I want this to burn into your brain!
[01:25:27.033 --> 01:25:28.273]  I mean just, BAM!
[01:25:28.293 --> 01:25:28.994]  Let's get it in there!
[01:25:29.414 --> 01:25:30.415]  Let's get it in there right now!
[01:25:31.335 --> 01:25:32.616]  Let's get it in there, hard!
[01:25:36.097 --> 01:25:41.140]  If you hadn't backed us, and you hadn't supported us, despite all my problems, I'm not perfect.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:42.981]  I don't claim I'm the golden calf here.
[01:25:43.601 --> 01:25:51.798]   If you hadn't backed us so hard, Worldwide, we'd be in way bigger trouble.
[01:25:52.158 --> 01:25:56.479]  And that's what freaks me out, is I can look at what we've done together, and I want it to burn into your head.
[01:25:56.679 --> 01:25:57.219]  You did it.
[01:25:57.239 --> 01:25:59.119]  I know you're not looking for credit.
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:05.661]  You just want these evil people off our back like I do as well, but you need to get the credit.
[01:26:07.481 --> 01:26:17.023]  Because when you get the credit, you realize that you're the only thing standing between the New World Order and our children, and I want you to get that in your mind right now.
[01:26:18.663 --> 01:26:21.064]  The listeners of this broadcast is who they hate.
[01:26:21.504 --> 01:26:23.104]  They hate me because of you.
[01:26:23.124 --> 01:26:24.445]  Because we came together.
[01:26:24.985 --> 01:26:25.665]  They hate us.
[01:26:26.545 --> 01:26:27.765]  They want to destroy us.
[01:26:28.206 --> 01:26:29.746]  Like he said, they hate how we look.
[01:26:30.086 --> 01:26:31.446]  They hate us having a good time.
[01:26:31.666 --> 01:26:32.727]  They hate our children.
[01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:34.347]  They hate the way we smell.
[01:26:34.447 --> 01:26:36.148]  That's so real what he said.
[01:26:37.488 --> 01:26:38.548]  They can't stand us.
[01:26:41.309 --> 01:26:42.609]  And I'm in the fight of my life.
[01:26:42.689 --> 01:26:44.370]  I'm in the 12th round with these people right now.
[01:26:46.172 --> 01:26:55.895]  And when I tell you that we need your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support, listen, if it's God's goal that we've gone this far and I'm going to get taken off the field, that's the way it is.
[01:26:55.935 --> 01:26:59.575]  Just like Mr. Davidson just said.
[01:27:01.556 --> 01:27:02.456]  But I don't want to give up.
[01:27:02.976 --> 01:27:04.157]  And I don't think my fight is done.
[01:27:04.177 --> 01:27:08.758]  In fact, I see us more effective and more powerful than we've ever been together.
[01:27:09.949 --> 01:27:14.014]  So I need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt.
[01:27:14.415 --> 01:27:15.276]  I need you to go there.
[01:27:15.336 --> 01:27:16.457]  I mean, I'll just tell you this.
[01:27:17.658 --> 01:27:20.742]  We've sold in the last year 60,000 endgames.
[01:27:21.163 --> 01:27:24.227]  A film I made in 2007 and all of it came true.
[01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:27.771]  And then I get Dinesh D'Souza's film, 20,000 of them.
[01:27:29.912 --> 01:27:35.617]  Which is incredibly powerful, improves election fraud, and is changing laws everywhere, and we've only sold half of them.
[01:27:36.297 --> 01:27:39.220]  And I'm not bitching at the audience, I just, I don't know how to explain this.
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:45.065]  Like, you know, you need to get 2,000 mules and have the DVD so you have a copy they can't censor to show people!
[01:27:45.085 --> 01:27:46.826]  You need to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get it!
[01:27:47.046 --> 01:27:51.109]  We got discounts for in-game and COVIDland Part 3 with it.
[01:27:51.630 --> 01:27:53.632]  I mean, you need that regardless.
[01:27:54.232 --> 01:28:00.553]   And you need to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get X2, and get Vazel Beats, and get Ultra 12.
[01:28:00.714 --> 01:28:03.517]  I mean, they'll all change your life and they fund our operation.
[01:28:03.557 --> 01:28:04.298]  They're incredible.
[01:28:05.848 --> 01:28:10.052]  And I'll tell you, I don't know what's special right after this, because this is all the products we've got left in stock.
[01:28:10.512 --> 01:28:14.015]  After that's gone, if the other products don't come in, I'll be up here at Donation Bay soon.
[01:28:14.535 --> 01:28:17.258]  And I don't think we can make it at that, but it's all up to God at this point.
[01:28:17.298 --> 01:28:18.639]  I thank people that have been big donors.
[01:28:18.659 --> 01:28:20.000]  Without you, we'd be off the air at this point.
[01:28:20.701 --> 01:28:28.467]  But I'm asking you to not play games and to go to InfoWarsTore.com, especially those that have been on the fence and have never bought anything.
[01:28:28.867 --> 01:28:30.709]  So many other great people have kept us on air.
[01:28:30.989 --> 01:28:33.712]  It's time for people that have been on the fence to go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:28:34.352 --> 01:28:35.954]  I don't know when we're going to end the July 4th special.
[01:28:35.974 --> 01:28:37.335]  A bunch of stuff's about to sell out.
[01:28:37.795 --> 01:28:41.639]  Every major product we got on stock, 40 to 75% off, double patreon points.
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:43.261]  Infowarrestore.com.
[01:28:43.841 --> 01:28:45.343]  And a storeable food is ready to ship right now.
[01:28:45.383 --> 01:28:46.304]  Preparetoday.com.
[01:28:46.684 --> 01:28:47.405]  Preparetoday.com.
[01:28:47.845 --> 01:28:50.268]  All right, we'll give the number out.
[01:28:50.628 --> 01:28:52.628]  Hour number three, your phone call straight ahead.
[01:28:52.628 --> 01:29:01.628]  [Music]
[01:29:01.628 --> 01:29:07.628]   At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all.
[01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:11.760]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[01:29:12.641 --> 01:29:16.345]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare.
[01:29:17.066 --> 01:29:19.328]  And that alone is something to be grateful for.
[01:29:20.009 --> 01:29:27.173]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut off.
[01:29:27.873 --> 01:29:32.595]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[01:29:33.356 --> 01:29:39.479]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[01:29:40.559 --> 01:29:50.262]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[01:29:50.842 --> 01:29:54.483]  Whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[01:29:55.724 --> 01:30:04.214]   Stock up now at preparetoday.com Hello Americans, I'm Paul Harvey.
[01:30:04.234 --> 01:30:06.157]  If I were the devil.
[01:30:07.098 --> 01:30:10.742]  If I were the prince of darkness, I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness.
[01:30:11.283 --> 01:30:17.690]  And I'd have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population, but I wouldn't be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree.
[01:30:20.753 --> 01:30:23.815]  So I set about however necessary to take over the United States.
[01:30:23.875 --> 01:30:27.378]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[01:30:27.718 --> 01:30:29.040]  I'd subvert the churches first.
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:30.981]  I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[01:30:31.281 --> 01:30:34.724]  With the wisdom of a serpent I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve.
[01:30:34.964 --> 01:30:35.785]  Do as you please.
[01:30:36.145 --> 01:30:38.247]  To the young I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[01:30:38.708 --> 01:30:42.150]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:46.114]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[01:30:46.634 --> 01:30:48.855]  And the old I would teach to pray after me.
[01:30:49.776 --> 01:30:52.117]  Our father, witch art in Washington.
[01:30:53.017 --> 01:30:54.138]  And then I'd get organized.
[01:30:54.238 --> 01:31:00.201]  I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[01:31:00.281 --> 01:31:03.423]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[01:31:03.703 --> 01:31:05.424]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[01:31:05.464 --> 01:31:08.486]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[01:31:08.766 --> 01:31:10.607]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[01:31:11.607 --> 01:31:22.892]  If I were the devil, I'd soon have families at war with themselves, churches at war with themselves, and nations at war with themselves, until each in its turn was consumed.
[01:31:22.992 --> 01:31:28.134]  And with promises of higher ratings, I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the flame.
[01:31:28.194 --> 01:31:30.976]  The President of the United States is racist.
[01:31:31.096 --> 01:31:38.879]   If I were the devil, I would encourage schools to refine young intellects, but neglect the discipline of I'd have prisons overflowing.
[01:31:38.999 --> 01:31:41.501]  I'd have judges promoting pornography.
[01:31:41.521 --> 01:31:46.223]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then from the schoolhouse, and then from the houses of Congress.
[01:31:46.303 --> 01:31:50.505]  And in His own churches I would substitute psychology for religion.
[01:31:54.653 --> 01:31:59.478]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[01:31:59.899 --> 01:32:07.228]  If I were the devil, I'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[01:32:08.922 --> 01:32:10.423]  I would caution against extremes.
[01:32:10.483 --> 01:32:11.384]  I'm here to warn people!
[01:32:11.464 --> 01:32:13.005]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[01:32:13.305 --> 01:32:14.185]  This isn't a game!
[01:32:14.385 --> 01:32:25.812]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct, I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned, that swinging is more fun, that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[01:32:25.952 --> 01:32:33.416]  And thus I could undress you in public, and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure.
[01:32:33.277 --> 01:32:40.277]   In other words, if I were the devil, I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[01:32:40.277 --> 01:33:00.475]  Now you know... the rest of the story.
[01:33:01.309 --> 01:33:05.271]  Facebook and Instagram banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:33:05.531 --> 01:33:06.652]  I am now completely banned.
[01:33:06.692 --> 01:33:10.754]  Now InfoWars of course is that web show and website led by rageaholic Alex Jones.
[01:33:11.014 --> 01:33:12.075]  I want them shut down.
[01:33:12.115 --> 01:33:13.035]  I want them silenced.
[01:33:13.075 --> 01:33:13.776]  I want them muted.
[01:33:13.796 --> 01:33:15.757]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:33:15.797 --> 01:33:17.398]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[01:33:17.678 --> 01:33:23.505]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[01:33:23.625 --> 01:33:30.534]  These are very extreme individuals, and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists, and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them.
[01:33:30.614 --> 01:33:34.358]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous, is what Facebook is saying.
[01:33:34.658 --> 01:33:37.662]  Those individuals include people like right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.962 --> 01:33:40.805]  If you don't like someone on Facebook, don't follow them.
[01:33:40.825 --> 01:33:42.307]  It's not that hard to figure out.
[01:33:42.127 --> 01:33:49.247]   Alex Jones and other Infowars pages had just simply circumvented any ban by starting a
[01:33:49.247 --> 01:33:51.167]  different account or going on Instagram.
[01:33:51.167 --> 01:33:54.207]  If you don't like someone on Facebook, don't follow them.
[01:33:54.207 --> 01:33:55.806]  It's not that hard to figure out.
[01:33:55.806 --> 01:33:59.087]   Facebook, are you going to do something about the liberals who call me the N-word?
[01:33:59.087 --> 01:34:03.806]   No, because big tech is only interested in going after conservatives.
[01:34:03.810 --> 01:34:05.112]  You know, the really dangerous ones.
[01:34:05.192 --> 01:34:08.335]  Dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[01:34:08.455 --> 01:34:17.624]  President Trump retweeted Paul Joseph Watson twice, and a brief video by InfoWars' Millie Weaver, social media's hall monitor, was not very happy about it.
[01:34:17.664 --> 01:34:20.827]  He is promoting the same alternative universe as InfoWars.
[01:34:21.007 --> 01:34:30.411]  Back to your point, though, about the InfoWars presidency, I want to know, and I tweeted this the other day, what is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[01:34:30.811 --> 01:34:33.032]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[01:34:33.553 --> 01:34:35.894]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[01:34:36.154 --> 01:34:37.174]  I want them shut down.
[01:34:37.234 --> 01:34:38.155]  I want them silenced.
[01:34:38.195 --> 01:34:38.995]  I want them muted.
[01:34:39.035 --> 01:34:40.876]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:34:40.976 --> 01:34:42.336]  I want them shut down!
[01:34:42.356 --> 01:34:43.877]  I want them silenced!
[01:34:43.897 --> 01:34:44.817]  I want them muted!
[01:34:44.877 --> 01:34:45.838]  Don't worry.
[01:34:46.217 --> 01:34:48.217]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[01:34:48.217 --> 01:34:52.936]  [MUSIC]
[01:34:52.936 --> 01:34:57.577]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:34:57.577 --> 01:35:03.256]   All right, we're going to open the phones up on the worldwide rebellions against tyranny
[01:35:03.256 --> 01:35:07.577]   and where you think that's going, and the fact that the New York Times is calling for
[01:35:07.577 --> 01:35:11.657]  Joe Biden to basically step down.
[01:35:11.889 --> 01:35:13.450]  They're calling for Trudeau to step down.
[01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:16.531]  All these different globalist puppets are being removed now.
[01:35:16.571 --> 01:35:18.031]  The collapse is in full swing.
[01:35:18.452 --> 01:35:24.474]  I want to talk about that and I want to talk, I want to hear from you on the subject of Hunter Biden's phone.
[01:35:25.514 --> 01:35:32.477]  Hacked and released, confirmed to be his, pedophilia, crackhead behavior, illegal guns, everything else you can imagine.
[01:35:32.917 --> 01:35:34.378]  This is over the top.
[01:35:36.243 --> 01:35:36.903]  Huge subject.
[01:35:36.943 --> 01:35:38.604]  The worldwide rebellion against the Great Reset.
[01:35:38.624 --> 01:35:39.184]  Your take on that?
[01:35:39.204 --> 01:35:40.104]  Where do you think it's going?
[01:35:40.784 --> 01:35:42.185]  That's a gigantic subject area.
[01:35:42.885 --> 01:35:45.646]  And Hunter Biden's laptop, they said, wasn't real.
[01:35:45.666 --> 01:35:46.126]  That was.
[01:35:46.526 --> 01:35:50.807]  And now they don't even try to deny the phone, which shows they've just lost their power to lie.
[01:35:50.847 --> 01:35:52.368]  They are disintegrating.
[01:35:52.408 --> 01:35:53.488]  But what comes out of that?
[01:35:54.821 --> 01:36:01.168]  Because if you don't remove the globalists, the corporate leaders that are running all this, we'll just destroy our governments, destroy each other as we wake up.
[01:36:01.248 --> 01:36:03.651]  We've got to not destroy our infrastructure.
[01:36:03.671 --> 01:36:06.554]  We've got to stop them that are attacking our infrastructure.
[01:36:06.574 --> 01:36:08.216]  That's so paramount.
[01:36:09.437 --> 01:36:10.198]  But we are winning.
[01:36:10.258 --> 01:36:10.979]  Hunter Biden leaks.
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:13.482]  Rock establishment is globally scrambled.
[01:36:13.502 --> 01:36:15.024]  We're in control of the Great Reset.
[01:36:16.749 --> 01:36:17.769]  And they're designed to collapse.
[01:36:18.489 --> 01:36:19.790]  The toll-free number to join us?
[01:36:20.010 --> 01:36:23.351]  We've been doing a really good job lately, taking a lot of your calls.
[01:36:23.431 --> 01:36:23.991]  Bam, bam, bam.
[01:36:24.011 --> 01:36:24.971]  We'll give each caller about a minute.
[01:36:24.991 --> 01:36:26.752]  877-789-2539.
[01:36:26.772 --> 01:36:27.572]  First-time callers.
[01:36:27.592 --> 01:36:28.452]  First-time callers only.
[01:36:28.472 --> 01:36:29.712]  Give them a chance to get involved.
[01:36:29.732 --> 01:36:29.793]  877-789-2539.
[01:36:29.813 --> 01:36:29.953]  877-789-Alex.
[01:36:29.773 --> 01:36:32.993]  First time callers only. Give them a chance to get involved.
[01:36:32.993 --> 01:36:35.773]  877-789-2539.
[01:36:35.773 --> 01:36:42.773]  877-789-ALEX. We're taking your calls today.
[01:36:42.773 --> 01:36:50.773]   You know, I see comedian Ben Stein that took the COVID-19 Pfizer shot and almost died from it.
[01:36:50.773 --> 01:37:00.773]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:36:52.565 --> 01:36:56.168]  And now I see him out talking about crime and how they let people commit crime.
[01:36:56.908 --> 01:36:57.989]  And he doesn't know why they're doing it.
[01:36:58.029 --> 01:37:01.471]  Well, it's to destroy infrastructure and destroy confidence and make the country collapse.
[01:37:01.691 --> 01:37:02.632]  It's why you get rid of the border.
[01:37:02.652 --> 01:37:03.793]  It's why you ship in fentanyl.
[01:37:04.013 --> 01:37:05.374]  It's why you defund the police.
[01:37:06.474 --> 01:37:09.076]  And then once they're done collapsing everything, they're going to bring the police back.
[01:37:09.496 --> 01:37:13.964]   But it'll be like, The police in Europe, total thugs.
[01:37:14.744 --> 01:37:15.984]  I mean, the footage that's come out.
[01:37:16.385 --> 01:37:17.305]  We played it last hour.
[01:37:18.145 --> 01:37:19.125]  Or first hour, actually.
[01:37:19.145 --> 01:37:21.306]  An hour and a half ago, two hours ago.
[01:37:22.946 --> 01:37:30.789]  And pulling up in vans, posing as protesters, attacking people, so the police could then attack the general crowds, including children.
[01:37:31.369 --> 01:37:32.629]  This is evil.
[01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:43.976]   But we're going to go here, when we go to break, to a couple of these Ben Stein Clips that are so incredibly important because he and others are finally waking up and finally getting it.
[01:37:44.016 --> 01:37:44.956]  But is it a day late?
[01:37:46.457 --> 01:37:49.840]  Is it a dollar short?
[01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:53.022]  So the last three minutes of this segment, we're going to play those.
[01:37:54.784 --> 01:37:57.926]  And then we're going to take your phone calls as well.
[01:37:58.526 --> 01:38:05.792]  Then I've got a whole list of new videos of leftists celebrating the murder of children and saying it's a satanic ritual.
[01:38:08.407 --> 01:38:16.969]  We've got a lot of election news and then I've got some really insane news that I'm going to hit when we start the next segment.
[01:38:17.609 --> 01:38:25.670]  How they sell us absolute oxymoronic garbage and you ask why do they do that?
[01:38:25.690 --> 01:38:26.510]  What discredits them?
[01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:35.792]  Well, there's a behavioral psychology plan and if you're not aware of the plan and how it's affecting your cerebral cortex, they win.
[01:38:38.487 --> 01:38:42.350]  If you're not aware, you lose.
[01:38:42.370 --> 01:38:46.713]  Introduce a few of the headlines today that deal with this.
[01:38:49.855 --> 01:38:54.958]  Science has consistently underestimated women because scientists are sexist.
[01:38:56.339 --> 01:39:01.722]  And it goes on to say women are as strong as men.
[01:39:04.150 --> 01:39:05.591]  And men can have babies, too.
[01:39:06.431 --> 01:39:09.133]  No, women are not as strong as men.
[01:39:11.454 --> 01:39:21.620]  And that ties in all these other headlines that we're going to be going to hear today.
[01:39:23.641 --> 01:39:24.802]  That's the start of the next segment.
[01:39:24.862 --> 01:39:28.644]  And then your phone calls for the balance of the hour, maybe a little bit the next hour.
[01:39:28.664 --> 01:39:31.566]  Gerald Celente is taking over.
[01:39:33.985 --> 01:39:35.165]  But I want to just say this again.
[01:39:36.126 --> 01:39:40.827]  Listeners and viewers of this broadcast are in the arena and have changed the whole world.
[01:39:40.927 --> 01:39:42.868]  That's not patting you on the back.
[01:39:43.708 --> 01:39:44.088]  It's real.
[01:39:45.129 --> 01:39:50.331]  So, you've invested in this operation and taken us through storms and attacks that are unprecedented.
[01:39:51.251 --> 01:40:00.014]  I'm simply asking you to protect your investment and to spread a word about the broadcast and to pray for the broadcast more than you've ever done before and to buy products at m4restore.com.
[01:40:00.494 --> 01:40:02.395]  Get 2,000 meals by the next decision.
[01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:05.751]  Get Vasil Beach for your heart and your body.
[01:40:06.131 --> 01:40:09.673]  Get Ultimate Fish Oil and Krill Oil, the highest grade there is out there.
[01:40:09.693 --> 01:40:10.233]  It's incredible.
[01:40:10.993 --> 01:40:16.916]  Get X2 that is the missing link in so many people's lives for stamina, libido, energy.
[01:40:18.988 --> 01:40:22.430]  I mean, I am, libido-wise, stronger than I was when I was 15, 16, 18.
[01:40:23.530 --> 01:40:26.072]  That's X2.
[01:40:26.692 --> 01:40:30.674]  It's all available, 40-75% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:40:31.454 --> 01:40:37.497]  And we're supposed to end the July 4th sale yesterday, but I'm so sold out of almost all the other products, I don't even have another sale.
[01:40:38.618 --> 01:40:40.559]  So we'll probably do this a couple more days and that's it.
[01:40:43.027 --> 01:40:52.137]  Infowarsstore.com for the high quality tooth whitening toothpaste, the activated charcoal toothpaste, the essential oil mouthwash that's bar none of the best out there.
[01:40:54.025 --> 01:40:54.645]  It's all there.
[01:40:54.825 --> 01:40:56.466]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:40:56.546 --> 01:41:09.829]  All right, we're going to come back to this absurdity of the brainwashing in your face and in your phone calls on the other side at 877-789-2539.
[01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:17.992]  But here are a couple clips of Ben Stein from his house in Los Angeles finally waking up to the fact that the social contract's been broken.
[01:41:18.012 --> 01:41:18.812]  We'll be right back.
[01:41:20.447 --> 01:41:29.213]  After World War II, the United States of America was by far the most powerful, richest country in the world.
[01:41:29.974 --> 01:41:31.895]  We had everything going for us.
[01:41:31.935 --> 01:41:34.316]  We had more money than any other country.
[01:41:34.377 --> 01:41:36.218]  We were more productive than any other country.
[01:41:36.838 --> 01:41:44.426]  We had a more powerful armed force than any other country and we were just seemingly never going to stop.
[01:41:44.846 --> 01:41:45.707]  What stopped us?
[01:41:45.747 --> 01:41:46.828]  What slowed us down?
[01:41:47.509 --> 01:41:52.414]  Telling people you don't have to work, you don't have to study, you don't have to pay attention.
[01:41:52.734 --> 01:41:54.375]  You don't have to respect your elders.
[01:41:54.695 --> 01:41:56.196]  You don't have to respect your juniors.
[01:41:56.657 --> 01:41:59.799]  We just let this country fall apart.
[01:42:00.239 --> 01:42:02.681]  We just took it, and we let it fall apart.
[01:42:03.101 --> 01:42:06.063]  We took all the people who wanted to hate America.
[01:42:06.423 --> 01:42:07.664]  We said, go ahead and hate.
[01:42:08.024 --> 01:42:10.826]  We're not going to prosecute you if you commit crimes.
[01:42:10.946 --> 01:42:13.008]  We're not going to make you do schoolwork.
[01:42:13.548 --> 01:42:18.612]  And so, little by little, and then faster and faster, we started to fall apart.
[01:42:19.332 --> 01:42:20.773]  This has got to stop.
[01:42:21.394 --> 01:42:26.338]  This country is the best thing that has ever happened to the human race.
[01:42:27.018 --> 01:42:28.559]  We can't let it go.
[01:42:28.579 --> 01:42:32.863]  We cannot let it go in order to please people who hate America.
[01:42:33.183 --> 01:42:36.926]  There is a large network of people out there who hate America.
[01:42:37.606 --> 01:42:39.408]  Let's not give in to them.
[01:42:39.768 --> 01:42:50.118]  Let's insist that people work, study, follow the law, and let's not have the criminal get out of jail before the victim gets out of the hospital.
[01:42:50.699 --> 01:42:54.643]  Let's pay attention to what is right and do it.
[01:42:58.130 --> 01:43:08.758]  I am talking to you right now on the three days after Christmas in the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel, one of the most beautiful hotels in the world, as far as I'm aware.
[01:43:09.639 --> 01:43:11.340]  And I want to talk about crime.
[01:43:12.381 --> 01:43:17.304]  When I moved here in 1976, this was a very safe city.
[01:43:17.485 --> 01:43:20.747]  And Beverly Hills was one of the safest places in that city.
[01:43:20.767 --> 01:43:26.892]  In fact, I think for a large city, it was probably the safest city in the United States of America.
[01:43:27.812 --> 01:43:30.315]  Uh, and, uh, that's changed dramatically.
[01:43:30.335 --> 01:43:32.497]  And here's, here's what's going on.
[01:43:32.577 --> 01:43:43.688]  For some reason, uh, which would take a lot of explaining, but it could be explained, uh, the government decides to basically stop punishing black people who commit crimes.
[01:43:44.529 --> 01:43:48.790]  And black people can commit crimes and not be prosecuted for it.
[01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:52.271]  Yes, they're embarrassed, at least to a small extent.
[01:43:53.071 --> 01:43:55.192]  And yes, their parents are mad at them.
[01:43:55.472 --> 01:44:01.233]  But they do not get away with anything less than murder.
[01:44:01.973 --> 01:44:03.613]  And this is a shocking thing.
[01:44:03.633 --> 01:44:05.454]  This is a very bad thing.
[01:44:05.494 --> 01:44:08.114]  So we have Glyndeborough City where people are happy.
[01:44:07.974 --> 01:44:12.134]  They go around with their doors unlocked to fear.
[01:44:12.134 --> 01:44:19.373]   We have become a city of fear and that is an extremely bad place to be.
[01:44:19.373 --> 01:44:26.894]   Ladies and gentlemen, two years ago the Hunter laptop was totally confirmed to be real and
[01:44:26.894 --> 01:44:32.172]   showed pedophilia, drug dealing, but even more importantly that he was a Chinese/Russian/Ukrainian
[01:44:32.172 --> 01:44:35.213]  operative for his father taking payments.
[01:44:35.213 --> 01:44:45.213]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:44:36.394 --> 01:44:38.976]  As of yesterday, it was leaked on 4chan.
[01:44:39.296 --> 01:44:45.241]  His phone, thousands of videos, text messages, emails, even worse than the first data drop.
[01:44:45.281 --> 01:44:49.784]  This is a seismic moment and the pedophilia is horrible and it's important.
[01:44:50.365 --> 01:44:52.407]  But that's how they blackmail him and control him.
[01:44:52.747 --> 01:45:00.413]  The issue that most people aren't focusing on is the fact that it confirms that he was an agent of Communist China and Chinese intelligence.
[01:45:01.654 --> 01:45:04.236]  Biden should be removed today, but they won't do that.
[01:45:05.538 --> 01:45:08.520]  They'll assassinate him, or say he had a stroke, and that's how they'll do it.
[01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:09.980]  That's my view.
[01:45:10.021 --> 01:45:11.181]  We'll see if it unfolds.
[01:45:11.741 --> 01:45:13.222]  Your phone calls are coming up in a moment.
[01:45:14.083 --> 01:45:15.163]  But first, let's hit this.
[01:45:15.764 --> 01:45:18.805]  Vice News, owned by HBO.
[01:45:19.766 --> 01:45:24.048]  Science has made us mistakenly believe women are weaker than men.
[01:45:25.789 --> 01:45:29.832]  The same groups tell you that men can have babies.
[01:45:31.155 --> 01:45:35.617]  They might as well tell us that the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy and Santa Claus and Lucky Charms is real.
[01:45:35.977 --> 01:45:36.777]  Or the Keebler Elves.
[01:45:38.458 --> 01:45:39.818]  They have whole articles about this.
[01:45:40.618 --> 01:45:43.199]  So they let men compete in women's sports and dominate them.
[01:45:43.499 --> 01:45:45.260]  Then they say women are as strong as men.
[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:45.640]  Yes.
[01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:48.401]  Do I need to explain to you that that's a lie?
[01:45:48.841 --> 01:45:50.322]  Where are the women in the NFL?
[01:45:50.382 --> 01:45:52.583]  Where are the women in the UFC fighting men?
[01:45:52.983 --> 01:45:54.423]  It is preposterous.
[01:45:54.483 --> 01:45:57.984]  No, there's men going down fighting women and winning.
[01:45:58.085 --> 01:45:59.025]  Not women going up.
[01:45:59.898 --> 01:46:00.878]  And fighting the men.
[01:46:01.958 --> 01:46:15.182]  But this is them brainwashing and putting out ridiculous fables and things you know isn't true, so you get used to just hearing preposterous lies, so the next outrageous lies don't seem as bad anymore.
[01:46:15.602 --> 01:46:17.042]  That's how they're conditioning us.
[01:46:17.362 --> 01:46:25.484]  Instead of us breaking with them, not believing a word they say, and exposing them as criminals, they're trying to normalize lying to the general public.
[01:46:26.736 --> 01:46:30.597]  Science has consistently underestimated women because scientists are sexists.
[01:46:32.598 --> 01:46:36.979]  And in this Economist headline from the Rothschild publication, low fertility is here to stay.
[01:46:37.039 --> 01:46:38.279]  We should embrace it.
[01:46:38.619 --> 01:46:41.060]  Not, why is our sperm count down 90%?
[01:46:41.380 --> 01:46:42.400]  Why is autism up?
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:43.941]  Why are women becoming sterilized?
[01:46:44.061 --> 01:46:44.921]  No, no, no, no!
[01:46:45.321 --> 01:46:51.083]  We should take the COVID shot, become sterile, drink the fluoride water, and then wonder why it happens.
[01:46:52.984 --> 01:46:57.106]  The fertility clinics have women take iodine and men take it because it boosts fertility.
[01:46:58.107 --> 01:47:00.868]  That's who these people are.
[01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.729]  Monsters.
[01:47:03.310 --> 01:47:03.670]  All right.
[01:47:04.831 --> 01:47:11.034]  We got Landon, Mike, Skid, Julie, Jordan, Josh, Mark, Neil, Tom.
[01:47:11.714 --> 01:47:13.575]  We're taking all your calls right now.
[01:47:14.176 --> 01:47:17.397]  And the order they will receive first up is a call from Seattle, Washington.
[01:47:18.358 --> 01:47:19.218]  Jordan, you're on the air.
[01:47:19.258 --> 01:47:19.819]  Thanks for calling.
[01:47:21.543 --> 01:47:31.111]  Hey Alex, I was just, you know, giving a call in to give hope to people that anyone that lives in a blue area like myself in Seattle, you know, you leave your area and you go somewhere else.
[01:47:31.131 --> 01:47:34.813]  If I just travel an hour and go east of the mountains, things are different.
[01:47:35.234 --> 01:47:37.415]  People believe in freedom and they understand the truth.
[01:47:37.916 --> 01:47:44.621]  And I just wanted to give hope to everybody that don't believe everything that's around you because you leave just a little bit from your hometown.
[01:47:44.721 --> 01:47:48.302]  No, when I'm in Seattle, I shake 50 hands before somebody throws coffee on me.
[01:47:48.822 --> 01:47:51.083]  But it's still one of the most evil cities I've been to.
[01:47:51.143 --> 01:47:54.484]  Formerly a great city, beautiful coastline, a lot of amazing stuff.
[01:47:54.504 --> 01:47:55.264]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:47:56.065 --> 01:47:58.946]  Don't believe that every place is really under the enemy's control.
[01:47:59.246 --> 01:48:00.766]  They're in control of the voting machines.
[01:48:01.306 --> 01:48:02.947]  That's why it seems like they're impossible to beat.
[01:48:04.642 --> 01:48:13.466]  No, yeah, I just wanted to give hope, because I know when I'm around here it feels like I'm behind enemy lines, but I can see people waking up, and we're truly a blessing.
[01:48:14.106 --> 01:48:17.367]  I just see it all happening in real time now, and it's crazy to see.
[01:48:17.707 --> 01:48:19.608]  Are you seeing them wake up in Seattle?
[01:48:19.668 --> 01:48:23.150]  Obviously, I've been outside Seattle, and it's incredible.
[01:48:23.170 --> 01:48:28.492]  People are more awake than many of the reddest areas, but are they waking up inside Seattle?
[01:48:29.472 --> 01:48:35.493]   Well, not the fentanyl zombies and all them, but I mean, You know, people outside of Seattle are waking up.
[01:48:35.513 --> 01:48:37.234]  Seattle might be doomed for a while.
[01:48:37.254 --> 01:48:38.734]  I could probably say that.
[01:48:38.794 --> 01:48:39.334]  Absolutely.
[01:48:39.354 --> 01:48:40.494]  Jordan, thank you for the call.
[01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:42.735]  Let's talk to Arizona and Josh.
[01:48:42.975 --> 01:48:43.315]  Josh.
[01:48:44.475 --> 01:48:45.915]  Hey Alex, first time caller.
[01:48:45.935 --> 01:48:47.495]  I appreciate you taking the call, man.
[01:48:47.976 --> 01:48:50.756]  I just wanted to make a quick plug for something that I've noticed.
[01:48:50.936 --> 01:48:54.397]  I've read the Book of Mormon probably 13 times cover to cover.
[01:48:54.977 --> 01:48:58.777]  What I've noticed is, is in the book of Helaman, it's a 16 chapter book.
[01:48:59.538 --> 01:49:08.468]   It talks about an election that was overturned And how a satanic band infiltrated the government and had their signs and their covenants and everything like that.
[01:49:08.889 --> 01:49:12.210]  I just wanted to get on air and honestly invite you to read it.
[01:49:12.250 --> 01:49:13.911]  It's 16 chapters.
[01:49:13.971 --> 01:49:14.892]  It's a quick read.
[01:49:15.292 --> 01:49:18.374]  And honestly, it completely describes where we are right now.
[01:49:18.634 --> 01:49:21.215]  It talks, you know, the Book of Mormon was written for our day.
[01:49:21.235 --> 01:49:27.338]  And that's what honestly turned me on to you was reading that and then hearing what you're talking about.
[01:49:27.378 --> 01:49:30.260]  I'm like, oh my God, like this stuff lines up perfectly.
[01:49:30.959 --> 01:49:31.760]  Well, I think I'll read it.
[01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:33.062]  A lot of people have told me to read it.
[01:49:33.923 --> 01:49:34.844]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:49:34.864 --> 01:49:37.228]  What else is on your mind on Hunter Biden, Josh?
[01:49:38.482 --> 01:49:42.284]  Honestly, I think that we've already known this stuff, and it really pisses me off.
[01:49:42.304 --> 01:49:48.946]  You know, I've had conversations with people, and they look at me like I'm a freak, because I believe all the stuff that you're spitting.
[01:49:49.486 --> 01:49:50.267]  But you see it.
[01:49:50.607 --> 01:49:51.847]  You read between the lines.
[01:49:51.907 --> 01:49:53.848]  You can see these things happening.
[01:49:54.068 --> 01:49:57.050]  Our government is run by satanic pedophiles.
[01:49:57.110 --> 01:50:02.732]  They have their signs, their covenants, and they're trying to bring about, you know, honestly, the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[01:50:03.192 --> 01:50:05.494]  This is, you know, we think things are bad now.
[01:50:05.654 --> 01:50:07.435]  It's only going to get so much worse.
[01:50:07.455 --> 01:50:07.936]  Well, you're right.
[01:50:08.036 --> 01:50:10.037]  And the devil's there to actually fulfill prophecy.
[01:50:10.217 --> 01:50:11.038]  Very well said, Josh.
[01:50:11.418 --> 01:50:12.099]  Appreciate your call.
[01:50:12.119 --> 01:50:13.680]  Let's go to Neil in Genesee.
[01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:14.400]  Neil, welcome.
[01:50:17.222 --> 01:50:18.043]  Hey, Alex.
[01:50:18.083 --> 01:50:18.543]  This is Neil.
[01:50:18.563 --> 01:50:22.806]  I've been listening to you since 2008 when Obama, you there?
[01:50:23.047 --> 01:50:23.307]  Yes, sir.
[01:50:24.602 --> 01:50:36.335]  Yeah, well, what I want to talk about was where the Great Reset is going and, you know, from my perspective, the globalists are more organized than the people of the United States or any other country for that matter.
[01:50:36.355 --> 01:50:40.680]  I mean, they've got the Democratic Party, they've got Soros, they've got the WEF.
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.382]  You know all the organizations they've got control of.
[01:50:43.402 --> 01:50:44.504]  They've got universities.
[01:50:45.084 --> 01:50:57.748]  And they're confusing and distracting us with ridiculous arguments about gender and eating bugs and drag queens and all that nonsense, so we don't focus on the real issue, which is the takeover that they're trying to do.
[01:50:57.768 --> 01:51:01.389]  That's right, the corporate global social credit score and the carbon tax, absolutely.
[01:51:02.563 --> 01:51:18.370]  Yeah, and you can't discount how powerful their grip on people is, because they got their support in this country by using the government to appeal to different constituencies that were probably in the conservative camp.
[01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:23.692]  But they appealed to all their vices, and they legitimized their vices.
[01:51:23.752 --> 01:51:31.555]  And when you legitimize somebody's sins, and then you try and take them away like they just did with abortion, they scream like hell, right?
[01:51:32.921 --> 01:51:35.303]  So it's very powerful, the grip they have on them.
[01:51:35.703 --> 01:51:51.476]  And what I'm really concerned with is, if we start winning, like with a guy like Jerome that you had on the program before, who really has the right idea, what he did is he turned it into a flanking strategy where you come in from the side and he changed the game by saying, oh, now we're going to make them public utilities.
[01:51:51.856 --> 01:51:55.359]  We've got to take every issue in this country and do what that guy did.
[01:51:55.965 --> 01:51:57.966]  With every single issue to fight back.
[01:51:58.066 --> 01:52:04.688]  My concern is, listening to Tucker Carlson's show the other night, the Chinese are working on the monkeypox in their labs.
[01:52:05.388 --> 01:52:06.708]  Oh, they released COVID.
[01:52:06.768 --> 01:52:08.089]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:52:08.129 --> 01:52:08.689]  Great point.
[01:52:09.169 --> 01:52:10.589]  And that's the next article here.
[01:52:11.210 --> 01:52:16.091]  Biden has declared a new health emergency and they're getting right with lockdowns again.
[01:52:16.111 --> 01:52:16.871]  We knew that was coming.
[01:52:17.211 --> 01:52:19.092]  We're going to hit that when we come back on the other side.
[01:52:19.812 --> 01:52:22.133]  But we're also going to take calls from Tom.
[01:52:23.033 --> 01:52:28.195]  And from Mark, and from everybody else in the order, your calls are received.
[01:52:28.635 --> 01:52:34.177]  More calls straight ahead here on this live, Monday, July 11th, worldwide broadcast.
[01:52:34.217 --> 01:52:39.099]  Remember, it's a revolutionary act to tell the truth in a time of universal deceit, to quote George Orwell.
[01:52:40.199 --> 01:52:43.320]  So share InfoWars.com and Bandai Video right now.
[01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:44.181]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:45.181 --> 01:52:47.142]  I'll tell you who's looking for adventure.
[01:52:47.162 --> 01:52:50.803]  Because he thinks he's above the law.
[01:52:52.776 --> 01:53:06.903]  Hunter Biden's phone confirmed searching for child porn, putting in the search that he wanted 12-year-olds.
[01:53:10.364 --> 01:53:13.906]  That's Peto Pete and his dad.
[01:53:15.507 --> 01:53:17.948]  That's who these people are.
[01:53:19.869 --> 01:53:21.910]  It's a pedophile cult.
[01:53:23.697 --> 01:53:26.019]  Who else would carry out Satan's operations?
[01:53:28.281 --> 01:53:31.503]  Who else would do things like this?
[01:53:36.187 --> 01:53:41.231]  Biden administration to extend the COVID public health emergency using monkey pox and other reasons.
[01:53:41.812 --> 01:53:44.894]  National parks, Democrat cities demanding masks again.
[01:53:44.934 --> 01:53:46.976]  They're bringing it all back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:50.458 --> 01:53:54.501]  That's why I said keep fighting, keep exposing the fraud of COVID, because they're coming right back.
[01:53:55.822 --> 01:54:01.186]  Opposition builds, the science comes out, all the experts oppose them, boom, they shut down.
[01:54:02.267 --> 01:54:03.928]  As soon as you go back to sleep, they attack again.
[01:54:03.988 --> 01:54:05.430]  It's basic tactics, you know that.
[01:54:06.090 --> 01:54:06.510]  I know that.
[01:54:06.570 --> 01:54:07.011]  Here we are.
[01:54:07.531 --> 01:54:08.852]  Tom in California.
[01:54:08.892 --> 01:54:09.473]  Go ahead, Tom.
[01:54:11.134 --> 01:54:11.654]  Yo, Alex.
[01:54:12.235 --> 01:54:12.575]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:13.256 --> 01:54:14.877]  Enlisted in since 2016.
[01:54:15.257 --> 01:54:15.898]  Welcome.
[01:54:16.298 --> 01:54:17.499]  Them trails gotta go.
[01:54:18.394 --> 01:54:25.680]  And I saw something on VanDock Video about a month ago of somebody talking about the Rhode Island Clean Air Act.
[01:54:26.821 --> 01:54:30.904]  And it wasn't any of you, it was an outside source you brought in.
[01:54:31.825 --> 01:54:36.629]  And whoever wrote the bill in Rhode Island really knew what they were talking about.
[01:54:37.129 --> 01:54:39.111]  They got into all the technical aspects.
[01:54:39.171 --> 01:54:44.735]  Oh yeah, VanDock Video has hundreds and hundreds of contributors, not just InfoWars.
[01:54:44.815 --> 01:54:45.536]  It's awesome, yeah.
[01:54:45.930 --> 01:54:47.470]  Well that's got to be in every state.
[01:54:47.650 --> 01:54:49.691]  Every state needs a bill like that.
[01:54:50.551 --> 01:54:54.011]  And can somebody dig it up there and bring it out?
[01:54:54.051 --> 01:54:54.932]  Maybe Greg Reese?
[01:54:55.852 --> 01:54:57.212]  Yeah, what was the name of the video?
[01:54:57.232 --> 01:54:57.752]  Do you remember?
[01:54:57.932 --> 01:55:00.553]  Okay, it was the Rhode Island Clean Air Act.
[01:55:00.973 --> 01:55:04.173]  So we should go to Bandod Video and type in Rhode Island Clean Air Act.
[01:55:04.213 --> 01:55:05.253]  Go to Bandod Video.
[01:55:05.594 --> 01:55:06.934]  Type in Rhode Island Clean Air Act.
[01:55:06.954 --> 01:55:07.314]  There it is.
[01:55:07.334 --> 01:55:08.894]  The crew found it so fast.
[01:55:09.454 --> 01:55:09.874]  56,000 views.
[01:55:10.394 --> 01:55:11.135]  Rhode Island.
[01:55:12.295 --> 01:55:13.355]  Infiltrated by communism.
[01:55:14.284 --> 01:55:17.866]  Every state needs a bill like that in their legislature.
[01:55:18.766 --> 01:55:20.828]  Was it a John Bowne report or did they find something else?
[01:55:21.388 --> 01:55:22.268]  I don't know.
[01:55:22.969 --> 01:55:23.869]  It was somebody else.
[01:55:24.449 --> 01:55:38.537]  I don't know who it was and I couldn't find it again, but whoever wrote the bill got into all the technical aspects of the planes and what, I don't know if they got into what they were shooting out of the back, but they got into how they did it.
[01:55:39.266 --> 01:55:46.433]  And the bill is very thorough, and I just think every state, a congressman from every state needs to bring this statement.
[01:55:46.473 --> 01:55:51.958]  That's right, it's been sprayed on us, and we all have standing to be involved in lawsuits.
[01:55:52.418 --> 01:55:57.783]  There it is, Bill to ban chemtrails, Rhode Island shocking takedown of geoengineering and 5G towers.
[01:55:57.824 --> 01:55:58.384]  Maybe that's it?
[01:55:59.425 --> 01:56:00.426]  Every state needs it.
[01:56:00.506 --> 01:56:02.248]  It's a great blueprint, that bill.
[01:56:03.323 --> 01:56:11.385]  And I don't know, there should be a real environmental group out there, not the ones they hijacked, that picks this act up and tries to get it into every show.
[01:56:11.425 --> 01:56:12.145]  I hear you, Tom.
[01:56:12.185 --> 01:56:12.825]  We need to do it.
[01:56:12.865 --> 01:56:15.486]  That's why we have Bandai Video, to get stuff out that they don't want you to see.
[01:56:15.506 --> 01:56:16.986]  That's why it's so precious, folks.
[01:56:17.006 --> 01:56:19.286]  Share it to your whole email list, your whole text message.
[01:56:19.306 --> 01:56:20.707]  Just keep hammering Bandai Video.
[01:56:21.327 --> 01:56:25.688]  All right, up next, let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Indiana, and then Landon.
[01:56:26.128 --> 01:56:26.828]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:56:27.779 --> 01:56:29.000]  Hey Alex, you were awesome, man.
[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:31.182]  Been listening to you since 2008, 2009.
[01:56:31.242 --> 01:56:33.965]  Take some of your products, and we love you.
[01:56:33.985 --> 01:56:34.846]  We'll keep praying for you.
[01:56:34.866 --> 01:56:35.666]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:56:35.726 --> 01:56:45.721]   I'm up in South Bend, Indiana, the home of, gosh, the irony that both Amy Coney Barrett and Pete Buttigieg came out of South Bend is That's crazy.
[01:56:45.761 --> 01:56:51.043]  It's a liberal Democrat hub, but we love Amy Barrett, and you've been having great guests.
[01:56:51.103 --> 01:56:53.724]  One thing I wanted to thank you is for having some of the Catholic guests.
[01:56:53.784 --> 01:56:59.626]  As a Catholic, I appreciate your respect, including Leo Zagami and the founder of Lifesite News.
[01:57:00.306 --> 01:57:05.748]  Awesome information, and they're right on as far as the infiltration of the Catholic Church, as evidenced by how liberal Notre Dame is.
[01:57:06.468 --> 01:57:18.152]  You know, suppose a Catholic University here in South Bend, but anyway, and also your guest today, he, not to out of the park, Jerome, Jerome Davis said, I'm going to send him some money myself, even though I'm in Indiana, just winning.
[01:57:18.552 --> 01:57:21.053]  Everybody needs, we all need people like him.
[01:57:21.533 --> 01:57:28.655]  So one other point, Alex, I told your guy I wanted to mention his idea for people is groups as a business guy here.
[01:57:28.675 --> 01:57:46.184]   I'm in Rotary, I'm in local HR groups and stuff, and what I've noticed over the years These national and international organizations like Rotary International, even the SHRM, the HR, national and international groups, they feed these agendas from national down to local, city and town.
[01:57:46.204 --> 01:57:49.905]  Agenda 21 is about taking over the local government and the local business people.
[01:57:50.705 --> 01:57:57.527]  Yep, and so people, if you're in a Rotary chapter or in one of these other groups, people need to be more vocal and just start challenging what they're being fed.
[01:57:58.787 --> 01:57:59.627]  Beautifully said, Mike.
[01:57:59.667 --> 01:58:00.307]  Thanks for the call.
[01:58:00.687 --> 01:58:02.408]  Landon in Arkansas, thank you for calling.
[01:58:02.448 --> 01:58:02.908]  Go ahead, Landon.
[01:58:03.874 --> 01:58:05.495]  Yes, Mr. Jones, thank you for having me on.
[01:58:05.516 --> 01:58:13.803]  I just wanted to say on here that my mother and my grandmother came over to my apartment last night, and they are militant leftists, or were.
[01:58:14.604 --> 01:58:22.691]  And we got into a conversation about kind of what was going on and everything, and we sat there for two hours, and I was able to show them your videos, your reports, Gregory's reports.
[01:58:22.911 --> 01:58:24.112]  He does a fantastic job.
[01:58:24.252 --> 01:58:24.492]  He does.
[01:58:24.753 --> 01:58:26.034]  And they got red-pilled.
[01:58:26.770 --> 01:58:30.252]  And they just said that they're going to start listening, tuning in, watching.
[01:58:30.272 --> 01:58:32.513]  So maybe they'll wake up.
[01:58:32.533 --> 01:58:37.235]  Well, it's so easy because we have the truth, our guests have the truth, and it's right there.
[01:58:37.335 --> 01:58:41.997]  And once people learn to actually hear the alternative, almost always they wake up.
[01:58:42.357 --> 01:58:43.658]  If you can just get them to do it.
[01:58:43.698 --> 01:58:45.018]  So great job doing that, Landon.
[01:58:45.759 --> 01:58:46.259]  Absolutely.
[01:58:46.319 --> 01:58:51.781]  And also, I'd like to say that I wear a Bill Gates for prison T-shirt and everywhere.
[01:58:51.821 --> 01:58:53.262]  I wear it everywhere out and around town.
[01:58:53.823 --> 01:58:55.645]  And I haven't got one negative response yet.
[01:58:55.685 --> 01:59:04.611]  People come up to me, give me knuckles, say, yeah, we agree, we agree, and when we get to talking about you, I tell them about Bandop Video, and a lot of them are already listeners.
[01:59:05.292 --> 01:59:06.773]  Brother, you are an emissary.
[01:59:06.853 --> 01:59:07.914]  You are an ambassador.
[01:59:08.014 --> 01:59:08.494]  You are a...
[01:59:10.737 --> 01:59:18.182]  I mean, I guess you could use the Christian example of people going out as missionaries and waking people up.
[01:59:18.202 --> 01:59:19.023]  You're changing the world.
[01:59:19.043 --> 01:59:24.707]  But yeah, wearing an InfoWars shirt, wearing an Arrest Bill Gates shirt, it lets you know how popular freedom is.
[01:59:25.928 --> 01:59:26.929]  It's an adventure, isn't it?
[01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:28.930]  Yes, it is.
[01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.491]  Absolutely.
[01:59:29.511 --> 01:59:32.773]  And I want to say on here as well that I was just recently baptized.
[01:59:32.833 --> 01:59:33.674]  I'm 23 years old.
[01:59:34.194 --> 01:59:35.235]  I served in the Marine Corps.
[01:59:35.982 --> 01:59:40.386]  And I'll tell you what, it felt like the weight of the world was lifted off my shoulders.
[01:59:40.426 --> 01:59:41.307]  I felt the power of God.
[01:59:41.327 --> 01:59:42.108]  Isn't it real?
[01:59:42.228 --> 01:59:43.549]  It's 100% real, brother.
[01:59:43.809 --> 01:59:44.610]  So glad to hear that.
[01:59:44.630 --> 01:59:45.010]  Yes, sir, it is.
[01:59:45.070 --> 01:59:46.892]  God bless you and keep up the good fight.
[01:59:46.912 --> 01:59:47.472]  We're going to win this.
[01:59:47.572 --> 01:59:48.273]  We're going to win it, brother.
[01:59:48.313 --> 01:59:48.633]  I love you.
[01:59:48.673 --> 01:59:49.314]  Appreciate you.
[01:59:49.714 --> 01:59:51.676]  Mark in Alabama, last caller of this segment.
[01:59:51.696 --> 01:59:52.497]  The more calls coming up.
[01:59:52.557 --> 01:59:53.177]  Mark, go ahead.
[01:59:53.197 --> 01:59:55.639]  Hello, Alex.
[01:59:55.659 --> 01:59:56.860]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:59:57.781 --> 01:59:58.722]  New Christian here.
[02:00:00.424 --> 02:00:08.386]  You know, God's plan has made a lot of changes in my life, such as my move to Alabama, which has put me in a much better place.
[02:00:08.706 --> 02:00:10.467]  And the last caller just had that experience.
[02:00:10.487 --> 02:00:14.508]  We're seeing a real revival, not of the corrupt church, but the Holy Spirit doing it.
[02:00:15.328 --> 02:00:15.908]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:16.248 --> 02:00:16.809]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:17.429 --> 02:00:27.372]  And I really want to thank you and your show, and I have to tell you that X2, I take it religiously, and I never used to dream.
[02:00:27.692 --> 02:00:29.929]   Now I dream Constantly.
[02:00:29.949 --> 02:00:31.810]  I mean, they wake me up.
[02:00:32.151 --> 02:00:32.911]  They're so hard.
[02:00:33.612 --> 02:00:34.893]  Exactly, brother.
[02:00:34.913 --> 02:00:37.555]  Again, wearing an InfoWare shirt's an adventure.
[02:00:37.856 --> 02:00:39.017]  Taking X2's an adventure.
[02:00:39.177 --> 02:00:40.538]  Nothing we promote is a fraud.
[02:00:41.038 --> 02:00:43.140]  I would rather be tortured to death than lie to you.
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:44.781]  It will change your life, X2.
[02:00:45.742 --> 02:00:46.203]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:46.843 --> 02:00:54.812]   And so, you know, this whole New World Order process It's an attack.
[02:00:54.892 --> 02:01:00.079]  So I was just thinking about George Bush's speech where he talked about a thousand points of light.
[02:01:00.519 --> 02:01:05.946]  I think he really meant to say we have a thousand points of attack coming at you because they are coming.
[02:01:06.066 --> 02:01:08.549]  They are hitting us in every single direction.
[02:01:09.090 --> 02:01:14.836]   And, you know, when you have little tiny attacks, People have a hard time looking at a big picture.
[02:01:14.856 --> 02:01:16.718]  So what you're saying is pure genius.
[02:01:16.738 --> 02:01:19.940]  You listen to Globals, they say, oh, our plan is many different plans together.
[02:01:20.581 --> 02:01:23.524]  They hit you from hundreds of sides so that you get overwhelmed.
[02:01:23.564 --> 02:01:24.024]  Exactly.
[02:01:24.064 --> 02:01:25.425]  But the key is they're behind it.
[02:01:25.505 --> 02:01:26.006]  They're doing it.
[02:01:26.809 --> 02:01:27.309]  That's right.
[02:01:27.909 --> 02:01:34.790]  And so as far as you, I have your stickers on my truck, on both my motorcycles, on my car.
[02:01:35.150 --> 02:01:39.411]  I constantly get people comments, you know, thumbs up.
[02:01:39.571 --> 02:01:42.072]  Almost never do I get anything other than that.
[02:01:43.692 --> 02:01:46.412]  I leave your stickers everywhere I go.
[02:01:46.512 --> 02:01:47.052]  Beautiful.
[02:01:47.132 --> 02:01:48.033]  God bless you, Mark.
[02:01:48.073 --> 02:01:48.553]  We love you.
[02:01:48.913 --> 02:01:51.913]  Yeah, folks, we need funds now more than ever.
[02:01:52.553 --> 02:01:54.014]  And our work is more important now than ever.
[02:01:54.174 --> 02:01:55.974]  Our work, you the listeners, us as a family.
[02:01:57.310 --> 02:01:58.531]  Every order gets bumper stickers.
[02:01:58.751 --> 02:01:59.291]  Experience it.
[02:01:59.391 --> 02:02:00.112]  Wear a t-shirt.
[02:02:00.212 --> 02:02:02.653]  Now, you might get stabbed to death in a leprosy area, but that's very rare.
[02:02:03.133 --> 02:02:04.014]  But it's dangerous.
[02:02:04.054 --> 02:02:04.634]  It's an adventure.
[02:02:05.175 --> 02:02:07.456]  Infowarshore.com and Alex Jones's right shirt.
[02:02:07.476 --> 02:02:10.958]  We have the designer shirt, the regular shirt, and their fundraiser shirts.
[02:02:11.018 --> 02:02:11.859]  Infowarshore.com.
[02:02:12.459 --> 02:02:15.781]  So, Biden stole the election, so Obama would have his third term.
[02:02:19.639 --> 02:02:20.679]  It all blew up in their face.
[02:02:21.499 --> 02:02:25.340]  And just two years ago, they were able to suppress the laptop and say it wasn't real.
[02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:28.001]  But now, a day later, they can't even deny the phone.
[02:02:28.561 --> 02:02:29.881]  Their power is waning.
[02:02:31.441 --> 02:02:33.262]  Our power is rising.
[02:02:33.322 --> 02:02:36.162]  But they are going to double down, and it's going to be very dangerous.
[02:02:36.822 --> 02:02:39.543]  This is the message I wanted to bring to you at the very start of the show, and I forgot to do it.
[02:02:39.563 --> 02:02:40.923]  I'm going to say it right now and go back to your calls.
[02:02:42.743 --> 02:02:45.704]  We don't want to be violent, though we have every right to be.
[02:02:47.247 --> 02:02:48.948]  We don't want to be terroristic.
[02:02:49.388 --> 02:02:50.549]  We don't want to act like the left.
[02:02:51.650 --> 02:02:54.511]  We want to get out of their way while they collapse and destroy themselves.
[02:02:54.871 --> 02:02:57.033]  They want us to be weak because they're weak.
[02:02:57.373 --> 02:02:59.234]  They want us to be ugly because they're ugly.
[02:02:59.654 --> 02:03:01.435]  They hate us because they hate themselves.
[02:03:01.515 --> 02:03:03.176]  We love ourselves and we love each other.
[02:03:03.196 --> 02:03:06.358]  So I'm going to say it again.
[02:03:07.519 --> 02:03:11.261]  We need to be as wise as serpents and peaceful as doves.
[02:03:12.816 --> 02:03:15.458]  Or as Teddy Roosevelt said, walk solid and carry a big stick.
[02:03:16.219 --> 02:03:18.721]  We need to not be violent.
[02:03:18.761 --> 02:03:19.942]  And I know you're not being violent.
[02:03:19.962 --> 02:03:21.303]  They're going to stage stuff and blame it on us.
[02:03:21.324 --> 02:03:22.084]  They've already been doing it.
[02:03:22.404 --> 02:03:23.045]  Told you it was coming.
[02:03:23.085 --> 02:03:23.405]  It's here.
[02:03:23.946 --> 02:03:24.787]  You don't need me to tell you that.
[02:03:24.807 --> 02:03:25.287]  You can see it.
[02:03:27.849 --> 02:03:32.653]  I believe it doesn't mean it's going to happen, but we're right about 95% of the time.
[02:03:32.713 --> 02:03:33.294]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:03:33.634 --> 02:03:35.356]  The media edited it out out of context.
[02:03:36.757 --> 02:03:38.438]  I said three or four days, like on July 1st.
[02:03:40.779 --> 02:03:47.325]  On that Friday, I said, hey, I've heard from high-level sources, Roger Stone that talked to Trump, MTG, all of them.
[02:03:47.645 --> 02:03:49.647]  Trump said, I'm going to run in July.
[02:03:49.967 --> 02:03:52.049]  His plane's done, repainted, American flag on it.
[02:03:52.069 --> 02:03:53.891]  I mean, I didn't just talk to them.
[02:03:53.951 --> 02:03:55.732]  I talked to four people that talked to Trump.
[02:03:56.072 --> 02:03:59.215]  They said, yeah, he's going to announce in July as early as Monday.
[02:03:59.716 --> 02:04:01.978]  And I said, hey, he's going to announce as early as Monday?
[02:04:02.018 --> 02:04:03.059]  He may not, but he's running.
[02:04:03.779 --> 02:04:04.480]  That's what I was told.
[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:05.881]  These are real people that talked to him.
[02:04:06.862 --> 02:04:07.442]  He didn't do it.
[02:04:08.567 --> 02:04:10.188]  And I hope we can expose this whole thing.
[02:04:10.208 --> 02:04:10.608]  It doesn't happen.
[02:04:10.848 --> 02:04:12.749]  I hope we expose their plan to assassinate Biden.
[02:04:13.209 --> 02:04:13.729]  It doesn't happen.
[02:04:13.969 --> 02:04:15.790]  Now, did I get told that by Roger Stone?
[02:04:15.930 --> 02:04:16.170]  No.
[02:04:16.190 --> 02:04:26.594]  I can look at their moves and what would help them get rid of this liability and blame it all on him, but also make criticizing his agenda bad, and that's what they'll do.
[02:04:27.254 --> 02:04:28.235]  You don't need me to tell you that.
[02:04:28.415 --> 02:04:30.175]  Obviously, you're like, yeah, they'll try to kill Joe Biden.
[02:04:31.536 --> 02:04:36.171]   But it's my mother, a year and a half ago, She's never liked this.
[02:04:36.851 --> 02:04:37.532]  Grabbed my arm.
[02:04:37.672 --> 02:04:38.633]  We were over there at a family dinner.
[02:04:38.653 --> 02:04:39.373]  She said, listen to me.
[02:04:39.794 --> 02:04:40.634]  They're setting Biden up.
[02:04:40.654 --> 02:04:41.335]  They're going to kill him.
[02:04:42.276 --> 02:04:45.198]  After he gets the blame, probably before the midterms, I'm like, okay, I'm probably right.
[02:04:45.218 --> 02:04:45.759]  Yeah, it makes sense.
[02:04:46.619 --> 02:04:59.390]  And I'm just telling you now that they can launch a terror attack on the Bidens when they're in, you know, off in their state or whatever in Delaware.
[02:05:02.062 --> 02:05:03.182]  We are not behind that.
[02:05:03.262 --> 02:05:04.283]  We don't support that.
[02:05:04.363 --> 02:05:05.343]  We're on record saying that.
[02:05:05.383 --> 02:05:06.223]  That's all I'm getting at.
[02:05:06.443 --> 02:05:08.864]  Let's go to Julie in California.
[02:05:08.904 --> 02:05:09.784]  Julie, thanks for calling.
[02:05:09.804 --> 02:05:10.344]  Thanks for holding.
[02:05:10.364 --> 02:05:10.704]  Go ahead.
[02:05:11.524 --> 02:05:12.004]  Hey, Alex.
[02:05:12.044 --> 02:05:12.544]  How are you?
[02:05:13.145 --> 02:05:15.205]  Um, yeah, on the whole Biden thing.
[02:05:15.525 --> 02:05:15.805]  All right.
[02:05:15.965 --> 02:05:18.166]  I've got an idea on how they're going to do this.
[02:05:18.746 --> 02:05:27.528]  First off, this has been like a drip, drip, drip, drip, drip with all these different things coming out about what Hunter does, the corruption with his brother, everything.
[02:05:27.748 --> 02:05:28.008]  Okay.
[02:05:29.370 --> 02:05:30.871]  They've got to get rid of Kamala first.
[02:05:31.371 --> 02:05:34.134]  She's worse than Biden is mentally.
[02:05:34.174 --> 02:05:38.478]  I mean, the woman can't even put a paragraph together without repeating seven different words.
[02:05:38.518 --> 02:05:40.960]  Yeah, they put two total idiots in on purpose.
[02:05:41.761 --> 02:05:43.582]  Yeah, so they've got to get rid of her first.
[02:05:43.982 --> 02:05:47.946]  She'll go out with some kind of major health thing which is going to force her to resign.
[02:05:49.427 --> 02:05:51.529]  Now, who do they put in for the VP?
[02:05:51.789 --> 02:05:54.232]  Well, who have they been talking about for the last three weeks?
[02:05:54.952 --> 02:05:55.653]  Gavin Newsom.
[02:05:56.977 --> 02:06:01.318]  That's right, they're definitely getting Gavin Newsom ready, who is Pelosi's family.
[02:06:02.118 --> 02:06:02.298]  Yep.
[02:06:02.659 --> 02:06:17.323]  So they put him in as VP, then after they get shellacked in November with the midterms, I'd say probably after the first of the year, however they get rid of Biden, that's going to be on there.
[02:06:17.683 --> 02:06:22.504]  I think that they'll just get him to resign because... They'll say he's had a stroke or something.
[02:06:23.646 --> 02:06:24.166]  Yeah.
[02:06:24.366 --> 02:06:25.787]  But see, I agree with you.
[02:06:25.827 --> 02:06:30.688]  That's the smart move I was in, but they want to make him a victim so they can assassinate him and blame us.
[02:06:30.708 --> 02:06:31.329]  That's even better.
[02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:33.909]  Yeah, but you know what?
[02:06:34.730 --> 02:06:35.790]  I think people will look at it.
[02:06:35.850 --> 02:06:38.771]  I don't think people view him very favorably anyway.
[02:06:39.311 --> 02:06:41.932]  Yeah, they probably carry the assassin around on their shoulders.
[02:06:42.953 --> 02:06:44.213]  Yeah, I just don't think so.
[02:06:44.293 --> 02:06:50.234]  I think they'll just get him out of the way one way or the other, whether they'll face the dementia or whatnot.
[02:06:50.254 --> 02:06:53.815]  I mean, I'm an ER trauma nurse, so I mean, I see a lot of stuff.
[02:06:53.955 --> 02:06:56.776]  And this man has been addled from day one.
[02:06:57.276 --> 02:07:02.116]  My grandmother died at 92, and she was more cogent than him, and she had dementia.
[02:07:02.537 --> 02:07:03.097]  God bless you.
[02:07:03.117 --> 02:07:03.877]  Incredible, Julie.
[02:07:03.897 --> 02:07:04.497]  Thanks for calling.
[02:07:04.517 --> 02:07:05.957]  Amazing calls.
[02:07:06.157 --> 02:07:07.137]  They're always amazing.
[02:07:08.118 --> 02:07:09.398]  Joanne in Arizona.
[02:07:09.438 --> 02:07:10.158]  Joanne, welcome.
[02:07:12.435 --> 02:07:13.898]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[02:07:13.918 --> 02:07:18.005]  I just want to say, first of all, I'm a huge fan of Jerome's.
[02:07:18.105 --> 02:07:23.815]  I actually got to meet him at two events prior to even knowing that he was running in my district.
[02:07:23.915 --> 02:07:25.037]  I am from Arizona.
[02:07:26.085 --> 02:07:36.972]  By the way, to interrupt you, I don't bring this up because they're black, because I don't care what color they are, but Royce White and Jerome, I mean, they just so happen to be black guys, but they are badass.
[02:07:37.072 --> 02:07:39.433]  I mean, I don't know whether they were brown or white or whatever.
[02:07:39.834 --> 02:07:41.635]  That is a badass crop of leaders, man.
[02:07:41.695 --> 02:07:43.896]  Well-spoken, smart, strong, on target.
[02:07:44.276 --> 02:07:45.317]  I mean, that is leadership.
[02:07:45.357 --> 02:07:46.358]  I'm just very excited.
[02:07:47.586 --> 02:07:48.326]  Absolutely.
[02:07:48.387 --> 02:07:51.228]  I mean, he's really going to represent us well.
[02:07:52.089 --> 02:07:56.351]  And like I said, I mean, I met him twice before I even knew he was running in our district.
[02:07:56.471 --> 02:07:58.132]  Oh, I can tell you, I got a gut level.
[02:07:58.372 --> 02:08:01.354]  Also, I mean, all I get is good feelings off him, don't you?
[02:08:02.389 --> 02:08:03.249]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:08:03.330 --> 02:08:06.511]  I gave one of my friends a flyer that I couldn't go to.
[02:08:06.531 --> 02:08:10.833]  She went to it and then told me about another event that he was having.
[02:08:10.913 --> 02:08:22.830]   I went to that and I started helping out any way that I can, hanging up posters and banners and Anything that I could do for him, and like I said, I haven't regretted it one bit.
[02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:25.732]  He definitely speaks our language.
[02:08:26.652 --> 02:08:30.075]  He's definitely speaking the truth, which is why they're censoring him.
[02:08:30.135 --> 02:08:31.576]  They don't want his message coming out.
[02:08:31.596 --> 02:08:32.077]  Oh, they're scared.
[02:08:32.097 --> 02:08:32.377]  They're scared.
[02:08:33.288 --> 02:08:33.969]  Absolutely.
[02:08:34.549 --> 02:08:38.952]  But one of the things, you know, I've been posting and just, you know, trying to get people informed.
[02:08:39.032 --> 02:08:42.755]  I was saying, you wouldn't buy a car without test driving it, right?
[02:08:43.116 --> 02:08:45.918]  You wouldn't marry somebody without dating them, or at least you shouldn't.
[02:08:46.398 --> 02:08:48.960]  But why would you vote for a candidate without getting to know them?
[02:08:49.140 --> 02:08:50.641]  I mean, there are so many meet and greets.
[02:08:50.661 --> 02:08:52.783]  We should all get to know these people.
[02:08:53.303 --> 02:08:54.264]  I totally agree with you.
[02:08:54.304 --> 02:08:54.724]  Thank you.
[02:08:54.744 --> 02:08:57.026]  All right, let's take another caller here.
[02:08:57.046 --> 02:08:59.868]  Let's talk to Skid in Missouri.
[02:08:59.888 --> 02:09:00.729]  Skid, thanks for calling.
[02:09:02.475 --> 02:09:06.758]  Hey Alex, just wanted to respond to your Hunter Biden phone question.
[02:09:07.478 --> 02:09:07.778]  Yes, sir.
[02:09:09.459 --> 02:09:11.961]  It's nothing we haven't seen before, so what are we going to do about it?
[02:09:13.402 --> 02:09:14.062]  No, I agree.
[02:09:14.122 --> 02:09:17.024]  But before they said it wasn't real, now they capitulate.
[02:09:17.044 --> 02:09:18.325]  They don't have that power anymore.
[02:09:19.686 --> 02:09:23.328]  They already screwed the pooch denying the last thing, so what are they going to do?
[02:09:23.348 --> 02:09:24.689]  I mean, it's pedophilia, folks.
[02:09:25.805 --> 02:09:27.647]  Twitter went up this weekend.
[02:09:27.747 --> 02:09:32.270]  I started getting all kinds of notifications, and it was like, yeah, nothing we haven't seen before.
[02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:33.191]  It's all a year ago.
[02:09:34.292 --> 02:09:38.375]  I agree, but they're doing full court press in big tech to block it, and it's not working.
[02:09:38.715 --> 02:09:43.839]  So again, I just see that as an indicator of their power is diminishing like a lead balloon.
[02:09:43.859 --> 02:09:45.521]  That's good.
[02:09:46.721 --> 02:09:48.303]  What do you think is coming next, Skid?
[02:09:50.656 --> 02:09:53.818]  Oh, everything that you've, in line with what you've said so far.
[02:09:54.058 --> 02:09:56.760]  I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if he gets taken out tomorrow.
[02:09:57.660 --> 02:09:58.381]  Biden, I mean.
[02:09:58.441 --> 02:09:59.341]  I agree.
[02:09:59.541 --> 02:09:59.922]  I'm ready.
[02:10:00.082 --> 02:10:02.863]  I mean, truck bomb, mass shooting, Biden's dead.
[02:10:02.883 --> 02:10:06.366]  I hope that doesn't happen, but he got level.
[02:10:06.386 --> 02:10:07.506]  Don't you just see that happening?
[02:10:08.507 --> 02:10:09.407]  Blame me and you.
[02:10:09.708 --> 02:10:10.928]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:10:11.328 --> 02:10:11.529]  All right.
[02:10:11.549 --> 02:10:12.169]  God bless you, sir.
[02:10:12.189 --> 02:10:12.789]  Appreciate your call.
[02:10:12.809 --> 02:10:13.530]  Shannon, one more.
[02:10:14.330 --> 02:10:18.052]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in Missouri, the show me state.
[02:10:18.093 --> 02:10:18.593]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[02:10:20.791 --> 02:10:25.432]  Hey Alex, I want to talk about Article 1, Section 10, Clause 3 of the Constitution.
[02:10:25.972 --> 02:10:36.255]  If the federal government fails to secure the border, the states have the right and the duty to repel the invaders with force, if necessary, to keep their citizens safe.
[02:10:36.575 --> 02:10:39.436]  This is the key to securing the border in Texas.
[02:10:40.156 --> 02:10:42.517]  Abbott is running for re-election in November.
[02:10:42.937 --> 02:10:45.838]  Everybody in Texas needs to call their representatives.
[02:10:46.824 --> 02:10:50.487]  And demand they put pressure on Abbott to close the border.
[02:10:50.547 --> 02:10:51.308]  Exactly.
[02:10:51.328 --> 02:10:52.068]  Let's explain this.
[02:10:52.349 --> 02:10:55.671]  We don't need more troops to get the illegals and set them free to the feds.
[02:10:56.252 --> 02:11:00.135]  We need the state to declare its own emergency and throw them back over the border.
[02:11:01.216 --> 02:11:01.676]  That's right.
[02:11:02.077 --> 02:11:10.764]  And then they need to call Abbott's office and say, I am not voting for you until you close the border.
[02:11:12.282 --> 02:11:18.185]  And if you keep pushing this message, Alex, he'll capitulate and he'll close that border.
[02:11:18.205 --> 02:11:22.008]  Well, he'd be as popular as the Santas if he should grow some damn testicles!
[02:11:22.808 --> 02:11:23.228]  I know!
[02:11:23.248 --> 02:11:36.976]  If you keep the pressure on him and have everybody in Texas demand and say that we are not, call his office and say we are not voting for you until you close the border.
[02:11:38.425 --> 02:11:41.126]  It's a lawless, giant war zone.
[02:11:41.666 --> 02:11:45.568]  I mean, if one person shoots up a school and it's still terrible, they lock them all down.
[02:11:45.828 --> 02:11:51.810]  The border's thousands of dead every few months, total insane death, and nothing's done, and then they go, oh, the feds aren't doing it.
[02:11:52.130 --> 02:11:54.271]  Well, then that's your job, Abbott.
[02:11:54.331 --> 02:11:55.051]  I totally agree.
[02:11:55.752 --> 02:11:56.112]  You're right.
[02:11:56.232 --> 02:11:59.333]  Yeah, that's under Article 1, Section 10, Clause 3.
[02:11:59.593 --> 02:12:01.654]  He's not doing his constitutional right.
[02:12:02.654 --> 02:12:06.800]  And if you, he took an oath to the Constitution and he's breaking it.
[02:12:06.820 --> 02:12:08.041]  You break your oath to the Constitution.
[02:12:08.061 --> 02:12:09.143]  Kevin beautifully said.
[02:12:09.163 --> 02:12:14.209]  Alright, we got a five minute segment left before Gerald Cilente takes over.
[02:12:15.491 --> 02:12:18.295]  So we're going to go to Malik.
[02:12:20.083 --> 02:12:25.987]  Kenny and Bart, we're back in two minutes, and I'm going right to your calls, and you each get a minute and a half.
[02:12:26.067 --> 02:12:28.429]  So get ready for that straight ahead.
[02:12:29.069 --> 02:12:29.970]  But hey, you're seeing it.
[02:12:30.450 --> 02:12:32.131]  Evil isn't the only power on this planet.
[02:12:32.151 --> 02:12:33.452]  In fact, it's the losing power.
[02:12:34.173 --> 02:12:36.814]  For everything they do, it comes back on them way worse.
[02:12:37.475 --> 02:12:40.637]  We just got to keep our heads, be cool, and we're going to win.
[02:12:40.877 --> 02:12:42.198]  It's going to be rough, though.
[02:12:42.538 --> 02:12:57.099]  We'll be right back.
[02:12:57.081 --> 02:13:00.444]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[02:13:01.345 --> 02:13:05.049]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare.
[02:13:05.769 --> 02:13:08.031]  And that alone is something to be grateful for.
[02:13:08.712 --> 02:13:15.877]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut off.
[02:13:16.577 --> 02:13:21.300]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[02:13:22.061 --> 02:13:28.184]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[02:13:29.265 --> 02:13:38.947]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[02:13:39.548 --> 02:13:43.208]  Whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[02:13:44.409 --> 02:13:48.010]  Stock up now at preparetoday.com.
[02:13:50.350 --> 02:13:51.991]  Malik in North Carolina.
[02:13:52.011 --> 02:13:52.691]  Thanks for calling.
[02:13:53.751 --> 02:13:54.291]  Yes, sir.
[02:13:54.531 --> 02:13:57.852]  God bless you, Alex, and God bless everyone in your office and working with you.
[02:13:59.188 --> 02:14:03.731]  Uh, I am a legal migrant, 43 years ago came to this country.
[02:14:04.592 --> 02:14:05.553]  God took hold on me.
[02:14:05.573 --> 02:14:08.275]  I was a former Muslim slash Druze.
[02:14:09.435 --> 02:14:14.399]  God saved me by his grace and mercy and his love.
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:22.524]  Ever since he gave me a dream back in 1980 about America in a song that I never heard before.
[02:14:22.885 --> 02:14:23.905]  I never heard the music.
[02:14:24.826 --> 02:14:30.899]   I woke up because the beauty of the music woke me up with a My heart beating out of my chest.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:39.866]  The words of this music I remember were, America, America, wake up from your transgressions.
[02:14:40.627 --> 02:14:42.989]  I never knew what the word transgression meant.
[02:14:44.150 --> 02:14:47.132]  Ever since, I have a burden for this country in my heart.
[02:14:49.054 --> 02:15:01.956]   Back in 1991, during the Iraqi War, I was watching TV and God spoke to me and said, Same accusation this country is accusing Saddam Hussein with.
[02:15:03.837 --> 02:15:05.658]  It's doing.
[02:15:06.879 --> 02:15:14.684]  America is setting up its judgment by the things they are accusing Saddam.
[02:15:14.704 --> 02:15:43.708]   95, God said to me and spoke prophetic word in front of a 600 member church, said, While I will visit this nation while they are worshipping their idols in their stadiums, I will bring the judgment with the four elements, with the fire, with the wind, with the water, and with earthquakes.
[02:15:45.670 --> 02:15:52.829]  Lake Mead, 195 or 180 feet below normal level.
[02:15:52.872 --> 02:15:54.534]  America is under judgment.
[02:15:54.554 --> 02:15:58.236]  God is angry with this nation.
[02:15:58.076 --> 02:16:01.115]  I agree, America is under judgment.
[02:16:01.115 --> 02:16:10.475]   Penns were dying while at the same time in floods in Colorado was killing people.
[02:16:10.475 --> 02:16:13.555]  God is angry with this nation.
[02:16:13.555 --> 02:16:18.914]   He loves the people of this nation, but he's angry with this nation for allowing the sin
[02:16:18.914 --> 02:16:28.755]   and the debauchery and this wicked sinner, this wicked man that's sitting in the White
[02:16:28.755 --> 02:16:37.475]   House selling out our country, selling out this land and getting, lining his pocket and
[02:16:37.475 --> 02:16:41.834]   the pocket of those who are around him with the money of the sale.
[02:16:42.543 --> 02:16:43.924]  And we are allowing him.
[02:16:44.604 --> 02:16:46.164]  We are in a great slumber.
[02:16:46.324 --> 02:16:48.065]  This nation is a great slumber.
[02:16:48.706 --> 02:16:50.027]  The church needs to wake up.
[02:16:50.827 --> 02:16:53.289]  America, America, wake up from your transgressions.
[02:16:53.369 --> 02:16:55.830]  We have transgressed against the living God.
[02:16:56.570 --> 02:16:58.351]  And we have sinned against the living God.
[02:16:58.851 --> 02:16:59.812]  And we need to repent.
[02:17:00.092 --> 02:17:01.193]  America needs to repent.
[02:17:01.233 --> 02:17:02.493]  The church needs to repent.
[02:17:03.054 --> 02:17:33.881]   And only through repenting, and only through seeking the face of God and asking God to forgive us from our sins and transgressions, only then the mercy of God and the healing hand of God will touch this nation and change the course Otherwise, we are doomed, as Henry Gruber saw in his vision, by an attack from Russia, a nuclear attack that will destroy our nation, an invasion by the troops, the Russian troops and the Chinese troops.
[02:17:35.350 --> 02:17:36.091]  All of this land.
[02:17:36.591 --> 02:17:37.912]  Malachi, I appreciate your call.
[02:17:37.972 --> 02:17:39.933]  They can only do that if we've been economically collapsed.
[02:17:40.414 --> 02:17:42.776]  All right, Gerald Salente, powerful calls coming up.
[02:17:43.136 --> 02:17:45.558]  I'm going to go to break for one minute, because I promise I'm going to recall her.
[02:17:45.898 --> 02:17:51.362]  Bart and Kenny, I'm giving you each a minute and a half, and then Gerald Salente is taking over, always on fire.
[02:17:51.442 --> 02:17:52.943]  The Trends Forecaster, a good friend of mine.
[02:17:53.323 --> 02:17:55.245]  Gerald Salente takes over here in about five minutes.
[02:17:55.545 --> 02:17:56.986]  We're back in 60 seconds.
[02:17:57.506 --> 02:17:57.927]  Stay with us.
[02:17:59.153 --> 02:18:09.798]  All right, we'll do a few more minutes here on this live Monday edition and Gerald Cilente is in the gate like a race car loaded with nitrous oxide about to explode on the highway.
[02:18:10.938 --> 02:18:12.679]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kenny and then Bart.
[02:18:12.759 --> 02:18:13.480]  Kenny and Bart.
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:15.200]  Kenny from Florida, go ahead.
[02:18:15.821 --> 02:18:19.182]  Hey Alex, I'll be 65 in October.
[02:18:19.202 --> 02:18:22.964]  I'm a disabled veteran and I've been listening to you daily since 2009.
[02:18:23.644 --> 02:18:31.196]   I've brought just about every product you sell, water filtration, supplements, And I just got my Alex Jones is right t-shirt yesterday.
[02:18:31.216 --> 02:18:34.877]  Brother, you have stood against Soros, the Democrats and everything they threw at us.
[02:18:34.917 --> 02:18:37.177]  They are so, they are so pissed.
[02:18:37.217 --> 02:18:37.698]  Let me tell you.
[02:18:37.778 --> 02:18:40.538]  Thank you for standing together with us in this.
[02:18:40.778 --> 02:18:43.599]  This is a long protracted war and you've done it.
[02:18:43.639 --> 02:18:44.139]  Thank you, sir.
[02:18:44.659 --> 02:18:49.481]  Well, one of the reasons I call it is I think I got an idea for a t-shirt if you decide to make any more down the road.
[02:18:49.801 --> 02:18:50.101]  Yes, sir.
[02:18:50.741 --> 02:18:54.382]  On the back have it say where's Ray Epps with a big black question mark.
[02:18:54.925 --> 02:18:58.925]  And on the front, over the heart, with a pocket, have Infowars.com.
[02:18:58.925 --> 02:19:00.425]  That's a damn good shirt.
[02:19:00.425 --> 02:19:01.925]  Where's Ray Hipps?
[02:19:01.925 --> 02:19:03.425]  [laughs]
[02:19:03.425 --> 02:19:04.925]  And something else, Alex.
[02:19:04.925 --> 02:19:08.925]   I don't know how we're going to get all these illegals out of this country without civilians getting involved.
[02:19:08.925 --> 02:19:15.425]   Because that's what our grandfathers would have done back in the '40s, '50s, and '60s.
[02:19:15.425 --> 02:19:18.425]  Well, they're admittedly collapsing the country.
[02:19:18.639 --> 02:19:23.620]  They're bringing groups in that won't be able to get jobs, so they'll be signed up for welfare under Democrat control.
[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:24.780]  You're absolutely right.
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:26.180]  It's got to be stopped.
[02:19:26.860 --> 02:19:27.460]  I love you.
[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:30.361]  God bless you, Alex, and I pray for you nightly, brother.
[02:19:31.321 --> 02:19:31.941]  Thank you, Kenny.
[02:19:31.961 --> 02:19:32.841]  I appreciate you, brother.
[02:19:33.561 --> 02:19:36.802]  It's those listeners keeping us on air, and it's so close.
[02:19:37.182 --> 02:19:39.183]  You've invested so much in the fight so far.
[02:19:39.603 --> 02:19:40.703]  Continue to bet on us.
[02:19:42.068 --> 02:19:43.989]  It's in God's hands, and God's working through you.
[02:19:44.349 --> 02:19:45.149]  Barton, Georgia.
[02:19:45.229 --> 02:19:47.050]  Last caller before Gerald Cilente takes over.
[02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:49.051]  Yes, Alex.
[02:19:49.151 --> 02:19:50.511]  Time for talk is over.
[02:19:50.871 --> 02:19:52.192]  We need a Sri Lanka 2.0.
[02:19:53.352 --> 02:20:06.677]  We need millions of patriots to peacefully lock down Washington, D.C., demand the resignation of Biden, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, and the prosecution of Hunter, because he's being protected blatantly by the FBI.
[02:20:07.758 --> 02:20:10.779]  Well, we know they're an illegitimate government that took over by fraud.
[02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:13.351]  No, we still have to try.
[02:20:13.371 --> 02:20:14.351]  Even if it's in vain.
[02:20:14.371 --> 02:20:16.211]  These people must be removed now.
[02:20:16.251 --> 02:20:17.192]  Time for talk is over.
[02:20:17.232 --> 02:20:17.832]  Voting doesn't work.
[02:20:17.652 --> 02:20:24.291]   of that. My issue is, is that DC doesn't run stuff. The whole infrastructure of the globalist
[02:20:24.291 --> 02:20:27.971]   program is other parts of the country. But I hear you. I mean, we have a pedophile government.
[02:20:27.971 --> 02:20:33.891]   No, we still have to try. Even if it's in vain, these people must be removed now.
[02:20:33.891 --> 02:20:37.652]   Time for talk is over. Voting doesn't work. They just steal the elections.
[02:20:37.652 --> 02:20:41.572]  What do you make of the Hunter Biden phone coming out?
[02:20:41.671 --> 02:20:42.672]  I mean, it's a pretty big deal.
[02:20:42.932 --> 02:20:44.353]  This time they can't deny it's real.
[02:20:44.553 --> 02:20:45.854]  They're in full panic mode.
[02:20:46.754 --> 02:20:51.217]  Well, the powers that prosecute are going to continue to ignore it.
[02:20:54.139 --> 02:20:55.780]  But what does that do politically to them?
[02:20:55.800 --> 02:20:57.641]  I mean, they are politically convicted.
[02:20:58.761 --> 02:20:59.442]  They don't care.
[02:20:59.522 --> 02:21:00.702]  They don't care about us.
[02:21:00.803 --> 02:21:03.484]  They know they're massively unpopular.
[02:21:03.524 --> 02:21:04.325]  They don't care.
[02:21:04.365 --> 02:21:08.227]  They're just implementing their sick agenda and their murder upon us.
[02:21:12.458 --> 02:21:13.319]  Well, I know this.
[02:21:13.539 --> 02:21:17.002]  The whole world is escalating into a Sri Lanka-type crisis.
[02:21:17.402 --> 02:21:18.703]  And I support the Dutch farmers.
[02:21:18.763 --> 02:21:20.484]  I support others protesting its policies.
[02:21:21.305 --> 02:21:27.850]  But can't you see how, that we just march on D.C., the politicians will fly on their helicopters.
[02:21:28.390 --> 02:21:30.052]  What does capturing those buildings do?
[02:21:31.849 --> 02:21:32.490]  I don't know.
[02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:34.031]  I guess we'll find out when we get there.
[02:21:34.371 --> 02:21:37.293]  Well, I know when they do it in other countries, then the military and the police join them.
[02:21:37.313 --> 02:21:38.574]  And I think we're very close to that.
[02:21:39.034 --> 02:21:41.996]  I just, I don't feel like I'm the guy to tell people to go do that.
[02:21:42.036 --> 02:21:46.240]  I don't feel like I'm the guy to try to lead that because I know how haphazard all this is.
[02:21:46.260 --> 02:21:48.561]  But I mean, we have an illegitimate government.
[02:21:48.581 --> 02:21:50.903]  The Justice Department's run by Chinese agents.
[02:21:51.984 --> 02:21:53.024]  Hunter Biden's a pedophile.
[02:21:53.084 --> 02:21:54.345]  So's the fake president.
[02:21:54.946 --> 02:21:56.267]  It's a crazy moment.
[02:21:57.850 --> 02:22:00.311]  I'm sure Gerald Cilente will be able to speak to all of this.
[02:22:00.331 --> 02:22:02.411]  He's about to take over for the next 50 minutes.
[02:22:03.151 --> 02:22:14.173]  And Gerald Cilente is an American trend forecaster, publisher of the Trends Journal, business consultant, author who makes predictions about the global markets, financial markets, and other events of historical importance.
[02:22:14.613 --> 02:22:17.294]  Cilente has described himself as a political atheist and a citizen of the world.
[02:22:17.894 --> 02:22:21.455]  He has appeared on everything you can imagine, trendsresearch.com, on Twitter.
[02:22:21.915 --> 02:22:24.415]  Gerald Cilente, he takes over now, my good friend.
[02:22:24.735 --> 02:22:26.716]  Gerald Cilente, what do you make of all this?
[02:22:26.736 --> 02:22:27.416]  I'm going to be listening.
[02:22:29.059 --> 02:22:35.723]  Well, first of all, thank you for all that you do and the InfoWars staff and everybody listening.
[02:22:36.283 --> 02:22:53.452]  Do everything you can to get these products, particularly the ones that you have to prepare in times of food shortages and more big problems coming ahead, because this thing is going down like we've never seen in the history of the world, part one or part two.
[02:22:54.477 --> 02:23:00.541]  We are going into the worst geopolitical and economic crisis that ever could have been imagined.
[02:23:01.461 --> 02:23:02.122]  You go back to 2020.
[02:23:02.882 --> 02:23:06.624]  I know that's ancient history for a lot of people.
[02:23:07.285 --> 02:23:15.250]  But what they did with this COVID war and locking down businesses, they've destroyed the lives and livelihoods of billions of people around the planet.
[02:23:16.190 --> 02:23:20.313]  And that guy that was just one of the callers talking about the immigration problem.
[02:23:20.793 --> 02:23:22.274]  It's not only the United States.
[02:23:23.328 --> 02:23:24.309]  Go to France.
[02:23:25.150 --> 02:23:26.191]  Take a trip to Italy.
[02:23:26.591 --> 02:23:27.792]  You think you're in Africa?
[02:23:28.753 --> 02:23:35.899]  Oh, by the way, let's go back because tracking trends is an understanding of where we are, how we got here and where we're going.
[02:23:36.980 --> 02:23:45.207]  It was a little slimy guy that everybody loved in racist America where they elected a black president.
[02:23:45.807 --> 02:24:06.373]   I mention that because to call this country a racist nation And to elect a lying piece of phony garbage, folks, he always used to focus, by the name of Barack Obama, who sold himself as a peace candidate, and turned out to be a piece of crap candidate.
[02:24:06.754 --> 02:24:10.816]  Going back to where things are going, how they're going, and about refugees.
[02:24:11.317 --> 02:24:13.358]  Once upon a time, there was a place called Libya.
[02:24:13.879 --> 02:24:21.558]   The richest country in Africa, and by the way, people having more rights, benefits, Than most citizens of the world.
[02:24:23.839 --> 02:24:25.700]  I want that guy Qaddafi out of there.
[02:24:26.461 --> 02:24:28.242]  Oh no, Salenti, don't say it like that.
[02:24:28.802 --> 02:24:30.183]  No, you have to be proper.
[02:24:31.323 --> 02:24:32.504]  Qaddafi has to go.
[02:24:33.024 --> 02:24:35.106]  We're going to bring freedom and democracy there.
[02:24:37.187 --> 02:24:38.427]  Oh, we're going to get their oil.
[02:24:38.707 --> 02:24:39.028]  Yeah.
[02:24:39.508 --> 02:24:42.570]  You think we evaded because their major export is broccoli?
[02:24:42.990 --> 02:24:45.111]  Like the Bushes invaded Iraq?
[02:24:47.932 --> 02:24:48.773]  So, going back.
[02:24:49.403 --> 02:25:02.786]  Qaddafi warned Europe, you overthrow me, you are going to see an immigrant and refugee crisis that you won't be able to handle.
[02:25:03.166 --> 02:25:11.468]  Because many of them were coming up out of Africa, through Libya and into Europe, but not under Qaddafi.
[02:25:12.929 --> 02:25:18.230]  They got rid of Qaddafi, they killed him, and now you got these problems.
[02:25:19.420 --> 02:25:20.801]  We got to take the big picture here.
[02:25:20.921 --> 02:25:28.704]  I started with how they destroyed the economies of the world with these made up stupid lockdown crap.
[02:25:29.004 --> 02:25:30.664]  You got to stand one meter away.
[02:25:30.744 --> 02:25:32.685]  No, you got to stand two meters away.
[02:25:33.485 --> 02:25:35.546]  You got to wash down everything.
[02:25:35.666 --> 02:25:36.847]  Wash down everything.
[02:25:38.407 --> 02:25:40.828]  Oh, yeah, your chances of getting in from a touch state.
[02:25:40.848 --> 02:25:41.388]  It's only one in 10,000.
[02:25:41.788 --> 02:25:43.309]  Outside is about 1%.
[02:25:43.909 --> 02:25:45.670]  But we'll put circles outside too.
[02:25:47.182 --> 02:25:50.105]  These maniacs have destroyed life on earth.
[02:25:50.825 --> 02:25:54.529]  You are going to see a refugee crisis like we've never seen before.
[02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:57.892]  Business have been destroyed all over the world.
[02:25:58.172 --> 02:25:59.814]  Things were bad before this happened.
[02:26:00.875 --> 02:26:08.882]  You go back to 2019, the biggest richest country in Europe, Germany, was a fraction away from an official recession in 2019.
[02:26:11.659 --> 02:26:20.385]  Now you're going to see a refugee crisis, homeless crisis, like you can't imagine, all over the world because of the stupidity of these morons.
[02:26:21.466 --> 02:26:22.506]  You want to go to Sri Lanka?
[02:26:22.546 --> 02:26:23.727]  No, let's go to Sudan.
[02:26:24.228 --> 02:26:24.968]  How about Yemen?
[02:26:24.988 --> 02:26:26.049]  No, let's go to Morocco.
[02:26:26.069 --> 02:26:29.591]  They have some problems over there with people even trying to go to Spanish territories.
[02:26:31.352 --> 02:26:32.513]  One country after another.
[02:26:33.534 --> 02:26:35.215]  This thing was going down before then.
[02:26:35.375 --> 02:26:37.957]  There were strikes, protests, people taking to the streets.
[02:26:38.539 --> 02:26:45.505]  In protest of basic living standards, government corruption, crime and violence in 1919.
[02:26:46.406 --> 02:26:50.209]  Now it's going to explode way beyond that.
[02:26:50.349 --> 02:26:51.190]  Oh, then I forgot.
[02:26:51.530 --> 02:26:52.010]  I forgot.
[02:26:52.030 --> 02:26:55.373]  The stupid imbeciles, the little morons.
[02:26:56.654 --> 02:26:57.655]  And it's not a government.
[02:26:57.735 --> 02:27:00.778]  It's a crime syndicate that put these sanctions on Russia.
[02:27:01.511 --> 02:27:03.411]  Made a real bad situation worse.
[02:27:03.771 --> 02:27:06.892]  Hey, how about all you folks over there in Europe, huh?
[02:27:07.192 --> 02:27:08.973]  Like the way your gas prices are going up?
[02:27:09.273 --> 02:27:10.933]  Now they need to put the sanctions on Russia?
[02:27:11.633 --> 02:27:15.074]  We are in, Alex, and everybody, for the worst time we've ever had.
[02:27:15.474 --> 02:27:18.215]  So you better do what you can do, prepare for the worst.
[02:27:19.055 --> 02:27:22.896]  And InfoWars can help you with a lot of products that you need.
[02:27:23.556 --> 02:27:29.717]  Because it's going to be tough to survive, it's going to be tough to get them, and you better prepare for the worst.
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:34.123]  Because if the worst doesn't happen, you're okay if you're prepared.
[02:27:34.343 --> 02:27:37.485]  If you don't prepare and the worst happens, Jack, you're dead.
[02:27:38.185 --> 02:27:40.647]  So again, we're going to come back.
[02:27:40.687 --> 02:27:42.068]  The markets are going crazy.
[02:27:42.088 --> 02:27:43.029]  A lot's going on.
[02:27:43.469 --> 02:27:45.631]  Stay tuned and support InfoWars.
[02:27:46.331 --> 02:27:48.973]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:49.033 --> 02:27:55.878]  And again, everybody, what InfoWars is doing, what the staff is doing, how hard they work, the information they put up.
[02:27:56.457 --> 02:28:01.563]  Do everything you can to support Infowars because we are in the time of our life.
[02:28:01.623 --> 02:28:04.226]  I've been forecasting trends now since 1980.
[02:28:06.769 --> 02:28:11.295]  I'll put my track record up against anybody in the world.
[02:28:11.475 --> 02:28:12.576]  Do I get it right all the time?
[02:28:12.616 --> 02:28:13.137]  Of course not.
[02:28:13.979 --> 02:28:21.980]  Most of the time when I get it wrong, it's because of the inside deal going on, like rigging the markets, making up stuff like quantitative easing.
[02:28:22.060 --> 02:28:22.501]  Oh, yeah.
[02:28:22.881 --> 02:28:27.001]  Yeah, we're going to bail out all those guys that need money, that are our buddies.
[02:28:28.162 --> 02:28:38.083]  But I say that because if anybody's been writing a magazine since 1991 and bestselling books on trends, let's put our track record together and we can start talking.
[02:28:39.524 --> 02:28:41.984]  I'm saying this because World War III has begun.
[02:28:43.516 --> 02:28:45.917]  We have maniacs and lunatics in charge.
[02:28:47.317 --> 02:28:49.698]  To me, again, it's a crime syndicate.
[02:28:50.418 --> 02:28:53.739]  People call it, you know, the Republicans and the Democrats.
[02:28:54.119 --> 02:28:55.200]  They're sellouts.
[02:28:56.740 --> 02:28:59.821]  Morons and imbeciles call it campaign contributions.
[02:29:00.441 --> 02:29:02.202]  Adults call it bribes and payoffs.
[02:29:02.982 --> 02:29:04.823]  You don't got a lot of dough, you don't run.
[02:29:05.163 --> 02:29:06.003]  End of story.
[02:29:06.724 --> 02:29:11.105]  Yeah, every now and then, you know, one pops in, but not at the top.
[02:29:13.197 --> 02:29:13.417]  Yeah.
[02:29:14.118 --> 02:29:16.940]  It's one big club and you ain't in it, as George Carlin had said.
[02:29:18.381 --> 02:29:21.344]  So going back to this war, World War III, it's begun.
[02:29:22.424 --> 02:29:27.949]  If I said to Alex, hey, listen, Alex, I know you got guns down in Texas.
[02:29:27.969 --> 02:29:28.910]  Could you get me some guns?
[02:29:29.290 --> 02:29:30.771]  I want to go kill the guy next door.
[02:29:30.791 --> 02:29:31.612]  I can't stand him.
[02:29:33.053 --> 02:29:34.534]  And Alex said, yeah, here's some guns.
[02:29:34.574 --> 02:29:35.114]  Go kill him.
[02:29:36.075 --> 02:29:37.877]  Would you be an accessory to the crime?
[02:29:37.897 --> 02:29:40.839]  Of course you would.
[02:29:42.691 --> 02:29:44.652]  You're involved in it.
[02:29:44.672 --> 02:29:48.054]  America and NATO are at war with Russia.
[02:29:52.577 --> 02:30:05.325]  Brain-dead Biden proudly announced last Friday another $400 million in military weapons to keep bloodying the killing fields over there in Ukraine.
[02:30:08.988 --> 02:30:13.736]   And Putin's coming back and saying, listen man, What we're doing now, you haven't seen anything yet.
[02:30:15.737 --> 02:30:17.417]  You want to keep this going, it'll keep going.
[02:30:19.858 --> 02:30:21.839]  World War III has begun.
[02:30:21.859 --> 02:30:29.262]  They're not going to make it official until a nuclear weapon is dropped.
[02:30:30.342 --> 02:30:31.883]  Then it will become official.
[02:30:32.543 --> 02:30:36.544]  Just like World War II started when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor.
[02:30:36.564 --> 02:30:38.285]  Oh yeah, nothing was going on before that now, no.
[02:30:39.355 --> 02:30:42.157]  World War I happened when they assassinated the Archduke Ferdinand.
[02:30:42.217 --> 02:30:43.658]  Sorry, yeah, okay, great.
[02:30:44.598 --> 02:30:45.379]  It's going on.
[02:30:47.900 --> 02:30:59.987]  And, as the study came out, what it would look like with a nuclear war.
[02:31:00.748 --> 02:31:02.269]  They call it a little ice age.
[02:31:02.309 --> 02:31:02.909]  Isn't that nice?
[02:31:05.130 --> 02:31:09.458]   A nuclear war Between powers would trigger a little ice age.
[02:31:11.458 --> 02:31:15.979]  The event ended about a thousand years, that's all.
[02:31:17.599 --> 02:31:27.601]  A nuclear war between NATO and Russia or another pair of the world powers would trigger a nuclear little ice age lasting thousands of years, a new study warns.
[02:31:30.322 --> 02:31:36.003]  And these imbeciles, these clowns that we have running the government, talk about a nuclear exchange.
[02:31:37.845 --> 02:31:40.367]  One of the callers said, you know, we got to march on Washington.
[02:31:40.927 --> 02:31:42.909]  To go march one day doesn't do anything.
[02:31:44.430 --> 02:31:45.671]  I'm doing everything I can.
[02:31:45.691 --> 02:31:48.213]  Not a march on Washington.
[02:31:48.233 --> 02:31:50.914]  A march to take back the country.
[02:31:52.616 --> 02:31:56.278]  Something, you know, I'm warned to watch my language, you know.
[02:31:57.179 --> 02:31:58.320]  I may get banned for this.
[02:31:59.401 --> 02:32:00.321]  So, get ready.
[02:32:00.341 --> 02:32:04.084]  And I'll show you.
[02:32:07.605 --> 02:32:08.505]  Peace and freedom.
[02:32:10.666 --> 02:32:11.487]  Occupy Peace.
[02:32:13.368 --> 02:32:14.728]  Occupypeace.com.
[02:32:16.249 --> 02:32:21.611]  On July 23rd, I'm pushing for a major peace movement.
[02:32:22.832 --> 02:32:30.215]  I have Judge Napolitano coming, Scott Ritter, Gary Noe, and Phil Giraldi.
[02:32:30.475 --> 02:32:37.018]  Yeah, this is a former top CIA guy who got left the Bush White House.
[02:32:38.089 --> 02:32:43.251]  When he knew that they were lying about Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al-Qaeda.
[02:32:44.232 --> 02:32:46.213]  I'm having a band here, the Hot Damn Band.
[02:32:48.074 --> 02:32:49.754]  So spread the word and please come.
[02:32:49.774 --> 02:32:51.155]  We have to make the news with this.
[02:32:52.436 --> 02:32:54.737]  If we don't push a piece, we're gonna die in war.
[02:32:56.497 --> 02:33:02.900]  My generation... I read on, I think it was InfoWars today, they're getting rid of the name Baby Boomer.
[02:33:02.920 --> 02:33:04.121]  You can't say that anymore.
[02:33:04.984 --> 02:33:12.925]  In other words, like some country, I think the UK can't say mandate anymore or something like that.
[02:33:16.586 --> 02:33:18.406]  My generation was the big sellouts.
[02:33:19.607 --> 02:33:21.487]  I grew up at the height of the Vietnam War.
[02:33:23.227 --> 02:33:24.047]  I'm born in 1946.
[02:33:24.568 --> 02:33:26.728]  I'm prime draft me.
[02:33:28.148 --> 02:33:31.109]  I was too stupid to be against the war.
[02:33:31.729 --> 02:33:32.309]  I believed it.
[02:33:34.059 --> 02:33:37.860]  There's a slimy guy, James Buckley, or Barkley, or Buckley.
[02:33:37.940 --> 02:33:38.720]  James Buckley.
[02:33:39.380 --> 02:33:40.160]  Talk like this.
[02:33:40.220 --> 02:33:43.001]  Very arrogant, you know.
[02:33:43.281 --> 02:33:45.481]  I'm saying this, you have to swallow my crap.
[02:33:47.302 --> 02:33:48.982]  That's why people don't like me, by the way.
[02:33:49.002 --> 02:33:50.342]  A lot of people don't like me.
[02:33:50.822 --> 02:33:52.483]  Oh, you're not polite.
[02:33:53.223 --> 02:33:59.044]  I try to shove my crap down your throat and you get angry when I keep trying to force it down there.
[02:33:59.964 --> 02:34:00.724]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:34:01.244 --> 02:34:03.725]  Anyway, they sold the baloney.
[02:34:05.029 --> 02:34:11.691]  That if we lose Vietnam, the commies, the dominoes, the domino theory, dominoes are going to keep falling.
[02:34:11.791 --> 02:34:14.692]  One country after another, falling under communism.
[02:34:15.092 --> 02:34:18.894]  And before you know it, those dominoes are going to be hitting the shores of California.
[02:34:20.174 --> 02:34:20.674]  I believed it.
[02:34:21.435 --> 02:34:22.255]  I was too stupid.
[02:34:23.455 --> 02:34:26.416]  They're doing the exact same thing now.
[02:34:28.537 --> 02:34:38.224]   If we don't stop those Russians, Lithuania, then Estonia, Latvia, We're at war.
[02:34:38.244 --> 02:34:42.627]  They're selling the domino theory 2.0.
[02:34:45.849 --> 02:34:49.491]  If we don't unite for peace, we're going to die in war.
[02:34:51.172 --> 02:34:56.456]  The military-industrial complex, as Eisenhower warned, has taken over.
[02:34:58.317 --> 02:35:06.423]  And as for being so stupid, Richard Nixon said, people only believe it when they hear it on TV.
[02:35:07.958 --> 02:35:10.620]  And all TV is, it's the mainstream.
[02:35:11.661 --> 02:35:14.904]  The mainstream that flushes you right down the mainstream toilet.
[02:35:17.746 --> 02:35:21.129]  I went to a car show yesterday, just to see some friends who wanted to get out.
[02:35:21.789 --> 02:35:22.950]  Wasn't into the car show.
[02:35:23.991 --> 02:35:27.354]  And I looked at the shape of the people and how they were dressed and what they looked like.
[02:35:28.474 --> 02:35:29.195]  I was heartbroken.
[02:35:30.636 --> 02:35:31.437]  This is America?
[02:35:32.858 --> 02:35:35.460]  What happened to the style and the grace and the dignity?
[02:35:37.782 --> 02:35:39.523]  Look how low it's sunk at every level.
[02:35:41.024 --> 02:35:42.345]  Music, one bad rap.
[02:35:44.587 --> 02:35:46.028]  People dead on their phones.
[02:35:48.029 --> 02:35:51.592]  Dress like crap, eat crap, and the nation's turning to crap.
[02:35:52.873 --> 02:35:54.233]  And that's why we have to unite.
[02:35:54.274 --> 02:35:55.494]  Yeah, that's the way it used to be.
[02:35:55.534 --> 02:35:56.155]  Could you imagine?
[02:35:56.955 --> 02:35:59.457]  Look at the style and the grace.
[02:36:00.418 --> 02:36:01.859]  Breaks my heart to see what's happening.
[02:36:03.300 --> 02:36:04.140]  We're gonna take a break.
[02:36:05.001 --> 02:36:06.182]  Remember what we need to do.
[02:36:07.228 --> 02:36:08.148]  Support InfoWars.
[02:36:08.869 --> 02:36:13.150]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show, and again, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:36:13.890 --> 02:36:29.416]  Your future depends on it, because we're in a tough time, and they're keeping everybody off the air, and that speaks what they don't want us to hear.
[02:36:30.516 --> 02:36:34.118]  Again, as Alex was saying, I used to be on Oprah, the Today Show, Good Morning America.
[02:36:35.783 --> 02:36:38.264]  One time, he used to be on CNN like four times a month.
[02:36:39.204 --> 02:36:40.705]  You know, the Today Show.
[02:36:41.625 --> 02:36:42.565]  You know, all of them.
[02:36:42.845 --> 02:36:44.086]  He used to be on all of them.
[02:36:44.706 --> 02:36:45.626]  Fox and Friends.
[02:36:46.746 --> 02:36:47.207]  No more.
[02:36:48.047 --> 02:36:50.708]  I said, what would happen with the Afghan War, Iraq War?
[02:36:51.268 --> 02:36:52.028]  Didn't want to hear it.
[02:36:52.328 --> 02:36:53.348]  Get this guy out of here.
[02:36:54.309 --> 02:36:55.629]  He won't swallow our crap.
[02:36:57.590 --> 02:37:01.111]  As I said, World War Three has begun.
[02:37:03.091 --> 02:37:08.235]   New York City launches Nuclear attack preparations.
[02:37:10.956 --> 02:37:20.460]  New York City launched its nuclear attack preparedness public service announcement today, saying it's best to be prepared.
[02:37:22.521 --> 02:37:35.927]  Quote, while the likelihood of a nuclear weapon incident occurring in near New York City is very low, it is important for New Yorkers to know the steps to stay safe.
[02:37:36.974 --> 02:37:41.677]  The city's emergency management department said in an announcement.
[02:37:44.820 --> 02:37:45.860]  Look at this clown.
[02:37:46.861 --> 02:37:48.742]  Look at this stupid crap.
[02:37:51.965 --> 02:37:52.625]  Look at this.
[02:37:53.045 --> 02:37:55.527]  You know, these are bureaucrats.
[02:37:56.248 --> 02:37:57.669]  Bureau craps.
[02:37:58.309 --> 02:38:03.973]  These are people that can't get a job in the real world because they're so damn stupid.
[02:38:04.741 --> 02:38:19.647]  But, they suck right into the political system, bend over and take it, and then they do what they're told, and boy do they become arrogant, arrogant, arrogant, arrogant, nasty nobodies!
[02:38:20.087 --> 02:38:21.288]  We'll tell you what to do!
[02:38:21.308 --> 02:38:23.709]  I'm a bureau crap!
[02:38:24.269 --> 02:38:27.690]  I'm gonna make up crap, and you're gonna swallow it!
[02:38:30.271 --> 02:38:32.392]  I told you before, I'm born 1946.
[02:38:35.979 --> 02:38:50.251]  I'm a little kid, all of a sudden, in school, and you had to go under your desk.
[02:38:51.772 --> 02:39:00.059]  These are the same moronic, stupid, ignorant fools that are having air raid drills.
[02:39:00.339 --> 02:39:01.100]  Hey, dumbbell!
[02:39:01.420 --> 02:39:02.241]  Hey, stupid!
[02:39:02.581 --> 02:39:03.622]  Hey, moron!
[02:39:05.791 --> 02:39:12.973]  Going under a desk if an atom bomb goes off isn't gonna make a bit of difference.
[02:39:13.393 --> 02:39:13.653]  Why?
[02:39:13.753 --> 02:39:14.533]  How dare you?
[02:39:14.833 --> 02:39:16.494]  How dare you defy me?
[02:39:16.974 --> 02:39:18.014]  I'm your teacher!
[02:39:18.034 --> 02:39:19.354]  I'm your principal!
[02:39:19.734 --> 02:39:22.095]  You are a member of a government school!
[02:39:22.495 --> 02:39:23.875]  Get under that desk!
[02:39:28.076 --> 02:39:35.943]   Then, when we got too big to get under the desks, They used to put us out in the hallway in the school.
[02:39:36.663 --> 02:39:40.645]  We used to have to stand up against the wall with our hands behind our head.
[02:39:42.005 --> 02:39:50.108]  And the same arrogant, stupid imbeciles that they call teachers that teach us crap!
[02:39:51.229 --> 02:39:54.770]  If you see a flash, don't look at it.
[02:39:55.871 --> 02:39:58.912]  If I see a flash, don't look at it!
[02:39:58.932 --> 02:40:01.853]  I'll be toast!
[02:40:03.177 --> 02:40:08.660]  If I see a flash, you get it in your head.
[02:40:10.301 --> 02:40:15.645]  The people that are running our governments are mentally ill.
[02:40:17.786 --> 02:40:24.110]  That they're getting, oh that little slimy little arrogant boy who never worked a day in his life.
[02:40:24.750 --> 02:40:28.633]  Look at that jerk, de Blasio, that arrogant clown.
[02:40:29.830 --> 02:40:32.292]  Warren Wilhelm Jr.
[02:40:32.632 --> 02:40:34.614]  Warren Wilhelm Jr.
[02:40:34.914 --> 02:40:37.315]  is his real name, fat boy!
[02:40:37.335 --> 02:40:42.779]  Oh, I changed it to get the Italian-American vote, Salenti!
[02:40:43.980 --> 02:40:46.942]  And the people were stupid enough to believe my crap!
[02:40:47.563 --> 02:40:51.946]  Because I kept shoving crap down their mouth, just like I shoved crap down my mouth!
[02:40:52.366 --> 02:40:53.887]  I'm the de Blasio blimp!
[02:40:55.508 --> 02:40:57.109]  I locked down New York City!
[02:40:57.390 --> 02:40:59.031]  I destroyed the place!
[02:41:02.441 --> 02:41:09.727]  They got an office occupancy rate in New York City, depending on whose numbers you're looking at, around 35%.
[02:41:09.827 --> 02:41:14.070]  The place is a jank.
[02:41:15.131 --> 02:41:16.492]  Happy hour after work?
[02:41:16.672 --> 02:41:17.393]  No more.
[02:41:17.953 --> 02:41:19.094]  Nothing happy about it.
[02:41:19.274 --> 02:41:21.877]  Hey, take the subway, get pushed on the tracks and get shot.
[02:41:22.617 --> 02:41:23.778]  Oh, a night in Calcutta.
[02:41:24.158 --> 02:41:29.803]  Oh yeah, we got to spend all our money for the military as we have this third world infrastructure.
[02:41:32.881 --> 02:41:33.762]  It's a freak show.
[02:41:35.804 --> 02:41:37.985]  This is like, I can't, you can't make this crap up.
[02:41:40.327 --> 02:41:46.873]  The PSA encourages New Yorkers to take key, simple steps in the event of such an incident.
[02:41:47.093 --> 02:41:47.734]  That's a quote!
[02:41:48.935 --> 02:41:52.678]  The 90 second pitch starts with shots of destroyed city blocks!
[02:41:53.819 --> 02:41:54.980]  Destroyed city blocks!
[02:41:55.601 --> 02:41:56.842]  You see where they're taking us?
[02:41:57.549 --> 02:41:59.670]  This is how they got us into the COVID war.
[02:41:59.890 --> 02:42:03.793]  They do it step by step by step by step by step.
[02:42:04.093 --> 02:42:05.994]  The propaganda has begun.
[02:42:07.375 --> 02:42:08.435]  Get this in your head.
[02:42:09.756 --> 02:42:10.496]  Get inside.
[02:42:11.237 --> 02:42:12.077]  Stay inside.
[02:42:13.378 --> 02:42:14.018]  Stay tuned.
[02:42:15.939 --> 02:42:16.800]  Stay inside.
[02:42:17.941 --> 02:42:18.621]  Get inside.
[02:42:18.641 --> 02:42:23.584]  I can't say these words I like to say.
[02:42:25.425 --> 02:42:25.605]  Yep.
[02:42:29.172 --> 02:42:31.934]  The third step is to stay put and stay tuned.
[02:42:32.494 --> 02:42:42.134]   Following media for any new information, New Yorkers can sign up to Notify NYC for official alerts and updates at
[02:42:42.134 --> 02:42:49.494]  NewYorkCityGov/NotifyNYC or by calling 311.
[02:42:49.494 --> 02:42:54.494]  I'm fighting for peace.
[02:42:54.591 --> 02:42:55.391]  Look, there we go.
[02:42:55.431 --> 02:42:55.852]  That was it.
[02:42:56.440 --> 02:42:56.821]  That was it.
[02:42:57.061 --> 02:42:58.462]  That's like, that's going to save your life.
[02:42:58.542 --> 02:42:59.884]  Duck and cover, they used to call it.
[02:43:00.364 --> 02:43:01.486]  That's going to save your life.
[02:43:03.788 --> 02:43:05.690]  And then same arrogant, arrogant.
[02:43:06.091 --> 02:43:06.811]  I passed the test.
[02:43:06.871 --> 02:43:07.672]  I became a teacher.
[02:43:08.033 --> 02:43:09.534]  I'll teach you the crap they told me to teach.
[02:43:09.554 --> 02:43:11.336]  Yep.
[02:43:12.698 --> 02:43:13.939]  Duck and cover.
[02:43:15.301 --> 02:43:15.501]  Yep.
[02:43:16.021 --> 02:43:18.021]  Scared the hell out of us.
[02:43:18.021 --> 02:43:22.021]  Yep.
[02:43:22.021 --> 02:43:28.021]  They're doing it again.
[02:43:28.021 --> 02:43:38.021]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:43:29.733 --> 02:43:35.557]  Remember, November 23rd, right up here in Kingston, New York, on the Four Corners of Freedom, go to Occupy Peace.
[02:43:36.157 --> 02:43:37.498]  Occupypeace.com.
[02:43:38.499 --> 02:43:48.065]  Starting at 2 o'clock, Judge Napolitano, Scott Ritter, Gary Noe, Bill Giroldi, myself, the Hot Damn Band.
[02:43:50.107 --> 02:43:50.567]  Here it is.
[02:43:54.169 --> 02:43:55.070]  We gotta stop this.
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.382]  If we don't unite for peace, we're going to die in war.
[02:44:01.103 --> 02:44:01.663]  It's happening.
[02:44:03.865 --> 02:44:06.707]  Look what's going on, what they've done with this, cutting off these sanctions.
[02:44:06.807 --> 02:44:07.928]  Couldn't be more stupid.
[02:44:07.968 --> 02:44:08.588]  Yes, you can.
[02:44:09.129 --> 02:44:11.150]  You can be a repulsive kid or a demo crap.
[02:44:12.171 --> 02:44:14.613]  We got imbeciles running and ruining our lives.
[02:44:15.734 --> 02:44:16.934]  They don't know what they're doing.
[02:44:19.016 --> 02:44:19.836]  These are freaks.
[02:44:21.558 --> 02:44:25.981]  Governor, Mayor, Presidents.
[02:44:26.889 --> 02:44:27.609]  Chancellors.
[02:44:31.010 --> 02:44:38.612]  Eisenhower said, any man that seeks the presidency is either an egomaniac or crazy.
[02:44:39.172 --> 02:44:39.572]  Got it?
[02:44:41.033 --> 02:44:43.393]  He didn't want to run, they wanted him to run.
[02:44:46.794 --> 02:44:56.125]   Five-star general, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, two-term president, warns us that the military-industrial complex It's basically destroying the nation.
[02:44:56.645 --> 02:44:57.286]  And here we are.
[02:44:58.526 --> 02:45:00.366]  World War III has begun.
[02:45:03.707 --> 02:45:07.308]  If we don't unite for peace, we're going to die in war.
[02:45:08.648 --> 02:45:10.988]  Oh, it'll only be a little Ice Age, Solenti.
[02:45:11.088 --> 02:45:12.769]  Only lasts for a few thousand years.
[02:45:12.949 --> 02:45:13.169]  Yep.
[02:45:15.169 --> 02:45:17.530]  Melt, burn, and freeze.

[02:45:38.601 --> 02:45:41.683]  What they're putting out, you know, it's the top of the top.

[02:47:29.753 --> 02:47:30.413]  So go do it.
[02:47:32.854 --> 02:47:38.857]  Because as I said, you know, we're in, we're in a, I've never seen anything like this.
[02:47:40.338 --> 02:47:44.080]  Again, they're doing nuclear drills in New York City.
[02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:44.720]  You got it?
[02:47:45.262 --> 02:47:47.043]  This is how they sold the COVID war stuff.
[02:47:47.123 --> 02:47:51.824]  Little time and time and time, till it got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger, and then it became real.
[02:47:51.904 --> 02:47:53.365]  They're doing the same exact thing.
[02:47:53.765 --> 02:47:55.105]  World War I has started.
[02:47:55.545 --> 02:47:56.906]  So you want to prepare.
[02:47:57.426 --> 02:47:58.686]  You prepare for the worst.
[02:47:59.747 --> 02:48:04.328]  If the worst doesn't happen, and you're not prepared, you don't lose anything.
[02:48:04.968 --> 02:48:09.690]  If the worst happens, and you're not prepared, you lose everything.
[02:48:10.290 --> 02:48:13.671]  So you could also stock up now at Prepare Today.
[02:48:15.596 --> 02:48:17.818]  Because you want to be prepared.
[02:48:18.938 --> 02:48:24.101]  And speaking of which, we have the equity markets going on and it dows down as I'm speaking about 200 points.
[02:48:25.341 --> 02:48:26.502]  Gold's been taking a hit.
[02:48:27.202 --> 02:48:29.963]  One of the reasons why is that the dollar is getting so strong.
[02:48:31.724 --> 02:48:34.886]  A dollar now against the euro, which is as big as competitor.
[02:48:34.906 --> 02:48:37.787]  Euro's down like a 20 year low.
[02:48:39.668 --> 02:48:52.492]   And again, the only reason they got in that euro, by the way, is they people like My older than me, who grew up, you know, kids during World War II, they saw the destruction.
[02:48:52.512 --> 02:49:01.696]  They saw the line that if everybody had a currency, one currency in Europe, there wouldn't be wars like World War I that just happened 20 years before World War II.
[02:49:02.377 --> 02:49:04.658]  So the people swallowed the crap like they always do.
[02:49:05.638 --> 02:49:14.638]   And speaking of crap and swallowing it, Uh, there's this guy, another arrogant boy, another daddy's boy.
[02:49:14.658 --> 02:49:23.922]  I went to Riverdale School, I went to Harvard, and I got a slew of, uh, draft defibrillants, but I pretend to be a tough guy, and I lie about it as well.
[02:49:24.642 --> 02:49:28.604]  And that's this, uh, Democrat Senator Richard Blumenthal.
[02:49:29.965 --> 02:49:40.488]   Last week, him and another little boy, couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag, a little fat-mouthed, warmongering little jerk, Lindsey Graham, Went to Ukraine.
[02:49:42.069 --> 02:49:42.249]  Yep.
[02:49:44.290 --> 02:49:44.490]  And?
[02:49:46.310 --> 02:49:48.171]  Richard Blumenthal, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:49:49.071 --> 02:49:58.334]  And according to Zelensky's office, the Ukrainian leader insisted to Americans that the military in Ukraine is certainly difficult, yet controlled.
[02:49:59.514 --> 02:50:00.155]  You know what that is?
[02:50:00.835 --> 02:50:01.875]  That's a lot of baloney.
[02:50:04.716 --> 02:50:07.357]  First, they said Putin's out of his mind when they started all this.
[02:50:08.363 --> 02:50:10.684]  Oh, then they were there for two weeks and they haven't gone much.
[02:50:11.804 --> 02:50:13.885]  And now they're going on the fifth month.
[02:50:14.965 --> 02:50:18.026]  They only own about, they only got about 25% of the country.
[02:50:18.046 --> 02:50:20.346]  25% of the country.
[02:50:20.906 --> 02:50:23.807]  You look at your cover of this week's Trends Journal.
[02:50:25.448 --> 02:50:26.128]  And what does it say?
[02:50:27.848 --> 02:50:28.989]  The big lie, right?
[02:50:29.009 --> 02:50:29.869]  Look at this little clown.
[02:50:30.369 --> 02:50:36.001]   How could anybody, how could anybody with a brain bigger than a pea listen to Lindsey Little Graham.
[02:50:36.401 --> 02:50:40.564]  An arrogant, arrogant, arrogant, arrogant, arrogant piece of crap!
[02:50:40.965 --> 02:50:42.346]  A little garbage boy!
[02:50:42.606 --> 02:50:44.427]  Because that's all that comes out of his mouth.
[02:50:44.727 --> 02:50:45.268]  Garbage!
[02:50:46.169 --> 02:50:47.289]  And then that Blumenthal.
[02:50:49.011 --> 02:50:52.053]  Yep.
[02:50:52.133 --> 02:50:55.996]  Oh, this is a quote from jerk Graham.
[02:50:58.078 --> 02:50:59.359]  Is there a Brutus in Russia?
[02:51:00.139 --> 02:51:03.262]  Is there a more successful Colonel Stoffenberg?
[02:51:04.212 --> 02:51:13.537]  In the Russian military, he asked, referring to the assassination of Julius Caesar and the would-be assassin of Adolf Hitler wanting to get Putin killed.
[02:51:14.657 --> 02:51:25.323]  So this guy, Blumenthal, this guy, when he ran for Senate, he said he misspoke about his military service during the Vietnam War.
[02:51:27.504 --> 02:51:34.457]   He goes on to say at a meeting, he said at a rally, We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam.
[02:51:36.519 --> 02:51:37.579]  He didn't serve in Vietnam.
[02:51:37.599 --> 02:51:40.362]  He got deferments.
[02:51:42.023 --> 02:51:55.373]  After he completed his studies at Harvard, pursued a graduate fellowship in England, served as a special assistant to the Washington Post publisher, Katharine Gary, and got a job in the Nixon White House.
[02:51:56.614 --> 02:52:07.886]   In 1970, with his last deferment in jeopardy, He landed a coveted spot in the Marine Reserves, which virtually guaranteed that he would not be sent to Vietnam.
[02:52:08.466 --> 02:52:17.089]  Yet this little clown boy, in 2003, he said, when we returned from Vietnam, we saw nothing like this and the people didn't like it.
[02:52:17.490 --> 02:52:19.270]  Everybody was against the soldiers coming back.
[02:52:19.670 --> 02:52:20.251]  Lied again.
[02:52:20.271 --> 02:52:20.251]  2007.
[02:52:20.291 --> 02:52:28.494]  In Vietnam, we had to endure taunts and insults.
[02:52:29.690 --> 02:52:31.051]  And no one said, welcome home.
[02:52:34.273 --> 02:52:35.354]  He said he misspoke.
[02:52:36.474 --> 02:52:37.935]  He didn't misspoke, he lied.
[02:52:37.955 --> 02:52:39.396]  He lied.
[02:52:40.377 --> 02:52:42.938]  All these people that get caught lying, they misspoke.
[02:52:43.239 --> 02:52:46.821]  Oh, by the way, I think that is sexist.
[02:52:47.241 --> 02:52:48.902]  How could you say misspoke?
[02:52:50.023 --> 02:52:52.765]  How about gender spoke?
[02:52:53.525 --> 02:52:54.666]  I gender spoke!
[02:52:56.320 --> 02:52:59.621]  We got a bunch of freaks running our lives!
[02:52:59.821 --> 02:53:00.882]  Get it in your head!
[02:53:05.503 --> 02:53:07.164]  I went nuts with a friend yesterday.
[02:53:07.484 --> 02:53:11.386]  He can't stand this new hokal there and said Cuomo was better.
[02:53:11.626 --> 02:53:12.426]  I went berserk!
[02:53:12.786 --> 02:53:15.227]  Cuomo better than a piece of garbage!
[02:53:15.927 --> 02:53:23.170]  This guy destroyed New York locking it down, making up crap, even saying he didn't have scientific evidence to do it.
[02:53:24.261 --> 02:53:26.603]  And don't call this stuff political science!
[02:53:26.903 --> 02:53:31.506]  There's no science behind the political crap they're spewing out!
[02:53:32.047 --> 02:53:33.287]  Political science!
[02:53:34.869 --> 02:53:35.949]  Polytics!
[02:53:36.510 --> 02:53:38.991]  Many tics sucking the life out of us.
[02:53:43.174 --> 02:53:46.597]  We are in... Going back to the markets.
[02:53:48.598 --> 02:53:51.120]  And going back to Infowars and preparing today.
[02:53:52.170 --> 02:53:55.031]  GCs, 3Gs, guns, gold, and a getaway plan.
[02:53:57.131 --> 02:53:58.852]  Because it's gonna get outta hand.
[02:53:59.532 --> 02:54:01.653]  You're seeing the violence escalating everywhere.
[02:54:02.593 --> 02:54:04.113]  Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere.
[02:54:05.154 --> 02:54:08.014]  Oh, and talking about that Blumenthal blowhard?
[02:54:09.215 --> 02:54:12.516]  Senators Blumenthal and Schumer have COVID.
[02:54:13.476 --> 02:54:17.077]  Senator Richard Blumenthal announced Monday that he tested positive.
[02:54:17.097 --> 02:54:21.478]  Quote, unfortunately I tested positive for COVID.
[02:54:24.977 --> 02:54:31.639]  I'm not experiencing symptoms and am thankful to be fully vaccinated and boosted.
[02:54:32.519 --> 02:54:37.321]  That's the crap that all of these little clowns, oh little Chucky Schumer got COVID too.
[02:54:37.861 --> 02:54:42.322]  All these clowns, fully boosted, fully vaxxed, double boosted.
[02:54:43.382 --> 02:54:45.343]  Oh, really glad I got the vax.
[02:54:46.203 --> 02:54:48.884]  I got COVID but I'm really glad I got it.
[02:54:48.904 --> 02:54:49.744]  I'm not sicker.
[02:54:50.104 --> 02:54:51.665]  Now I'm just sick of my head.
[02:54:52.580 --> 02:54:52.800]  Hey!
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:53.720]  Fatten out!
[02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:55.001]  I didn't get the vax.
[02:54:55.621 --> 02:54:56.421]  Didn't get boosted.
[02:54:57.221 --> 02:54:58.002]  Didn't get COVID.
[02:54:58.382 --> 02:54:58.962]  Wonder why?
[02:54:59.562 --> 02:55:00.923]  Oh, because of all the supplements?
[02:55:01.203 --> 02:55:01.903]  Natural healing?
[02:55:02.383 --> 02:55:03.363]  Why, that's a dirty word.
[02:55:04.043 --> 02:55:05.084]  Can't do that, Salenti.
[02:55:06.924 --> 02:55:10.265]  COVID boosters might be less than 20% effective.
[02:55:11.826 --> 02:55:13.886]  After a few months, that's the new study.
[02:55:13.906 --> 02:55:16.507]  Well, and this is real.
[02:55:17.047 --> 02:55:18.548]  It came out from an Italian study.
[02:55:20.268 --> 02:55:21.049]  20% effective.
[02:55:21.069 --> 02:55:24.355]   How about Basically ineffective.
[02:55:24.995 --> 02:55:27.376]  Remember they sold it with a 96% efficacy rate?
[02:55:28.076 --> 02:55:30.377]  The Pfizer to drug dealers made all that money, man.
[02:55:32.016 --> 02:55:38.176]   All right, remember, July 23rd up here in Kingston, New York,
[02:55:38.176 --> 02:55:45.057]   Peace and Freedom Rally, Judge Napolitano, myself and others,
[02:55:45.057 --> 02:55:46.855]  Occupy Peace.
[02:55:46.855 --> 02:55:58.376]   PrepareWithAlex.com hyperlinks to preparetoday.com, which is run by

[02:56:12.834 --> 02:56:16.496]  If you find something on there, maybe lower at Amazon, yeah, you want to support the New World Order?
[02:56:16.937 --> 02:56:18.998]  The point is almost all of its lowest price you're going to find.
[02:56:19.038 --> 02:56:19.939]  It's all very competitive.
[02:56:20.299 --> 02:56:21.420]  PrepareToday.com.
[02:56:21.460 --> 02:56:22.541]  PrepareToday.com.

[02:56:25.024 --> 02:56:26.145]  And this is how you beat inflation.
[02:56:26.445 --> 02:56:29.027]  You buy food now, and as the price goes up, you save money.
[02:56:29.087 --> 02:56:30.289]  I told you this 30 months ago.
[02:56:30.609 --> 02:56:33.191]  Those of you who bought food then, boy, were you smart.
[02:56:33.652 --> 02:56:34.753]  And it's only going to go up anyway.
[02:56:34.833 --> 02:56:38.396]  So even if you waited or didn't do it, now is the time to stop procrastinating.
[02:56:38.656 --> 02:56:40.458]  PrepareToday.com and be smart.
[02:56:41.019 --> 02:56:46.316]   Separately, we Hold back items for people to sign up for auto-ship with the additional 10% off.
[02:56:46.877 --> 02:56:48.317]  And they overheld some stuff.
[02:56:48.397 --> 02:56:50.858]  It's coming back in late July, they think.
[02:56:50.938 --> 02:56:52.799]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, one of our best-selling products.
[02:56:53.059 --> 02:56:54.720]  High-quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids.
[02:56:55.100 --> 02:56:57.281]  So tasty, so great for children, adults, you name it.
[02:56:57.601 --> 02:56:59.241]  Put a scoop of it in water, some ice.
[02:56:59.622 --> 02:57:00.182]  Tastes amazing.
[02:57:00.802 --> 02:57:01.702]  It does so many great things.
[02:57:01.742 --> 02:57:06.064]  Because it's liquid, you absorb a lot more of it than pills, even though they're high quality.
[02:57:06.084 --> 02:57:12.187]  We found 1,100 bottles of that, that because of a miscalculation with AutoShip we had, it'll sell out probably today.
[02:57:12.487 --> 02:57:18.510]  It's available at InfoWareStore.com as well, or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:57:18.650 --> 02:57:22.752]  And despite the fact that it'll sell out today, it's still 25% off.
[02:57:23.693 --> 02:57:27.394]  And I'm going to stop right there now, and I'm going to move back to your phone calls.
[02:57:27.474 --> 02:57:35.557]   Other than saying this, I talked to the National Citizens four weeks ago, five weeks ago, with I think the most important documentary ever proving that they stole the election.
[02:57:36.898 --> 02:57:41.079]  And I said, I bet I'll buy 100,000 DVDs from you because people want to have it in their archive.
[02:57:41.119 --> 02:57:42.639]  And it's such a historic film.
[02:57:43.239 --> 02:57:43.619]  And we bought 20,000.
[02:57:44.179 --> 02:57:46.300]  And I said, I think we'll be reordering it every few weeks.
[02:57:46.980 --> 02:57:48.240]  We've only sold out half of these.
[02:57:48.900 --> 02:57:50.000]  And I'm not mad at the audience.
[02:57:50.441 --> 02:57:51.821]  I just think you're crazy.
[02:57:52.742 --> 02:57:54.743]  With all the censorship online, what's happening?
[02:57:54.803 --> 02:58:02.306]  You need this historic film on your shelf to show friends, family, neighbors, your office, your boss, your employees, your church, whoever.
[02:58:02.846 --> 02:58:03.506]  And so we have it.
[02:58:03.526 --> 02:58:06.127]  We have Covid Land 3, the shot, getting into how deadly the shot is.
[02:58:06.527 --> 02:58:07.748]  Both those are just coming together.
[02:58:08.368 --> 02:58:09.088]  Everybody needs them.
[02:58:09.429 --> 02:58:10.529]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:58:10.569 --> 02:58:13.551]  And I'll be quite frank, I'm surprised more people haven't got it.
[02:58:13.751 --> 02:58:18.194]  I think you're crazy when you're ever on the site getting other products to not get this, and it keeps the show on the air.
[02:58:18.594 --> 02:58:20.816]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
