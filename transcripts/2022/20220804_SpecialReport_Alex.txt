[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.674]  The jury in Austin, Texas just came in this evening with their verdict against Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:14.053]  We're about to lay out the details on the other side.
[00:00:14.053 --> 00:00:21.053]  [Music]
[00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:30.053]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:30.256 --> 00:00:37.280]  I'm now going to read the answers given by those jurors.
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.720]  Just the answers.
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.260]  Question 1A, $50,000.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.660]  Question 1B, $10,000.
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.000]  Question 1C, $50,000.
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.021]  Question 1A, $50,000.
[00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:46.740]  Question 1B, $10,000.
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.721]  Question 1C, $50,000.
[00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:54.981]  Question 1D, no dollars.
[00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:58.341]  Question 2A, $1.5 million.
[00:00:58.317 --> 00:01:01.159]  Question 2B, five hundred thousand dollars.
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.302]  Question 3A, one and a half million dollars.
[00:01:05.522 --> 00:01:09.025]  And question 3B, half a million dollars.
[00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:13.589]  Is this your verdict, the ten of you who signed it?
[00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.872]  So say each and all of you, all ten of you.
[00:01:17.672 --> 00:01:17.832]  Yes.
[00:01:17.852 --> 00:01:18.113]  All right.
[00:01:19.574 --> 00:01:21.235]  Would the attorneys care to inspect the verdict?
[00:01:22.296 --> 00:01:23.917]  No, Your Honor.
[00:01:23.937 --> 00:01:24.678]  No, Your Honor.
[00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.872]  Um, then I will accept this as a verdict of the jury in order that the clerk enter it upon the minutes of the court.
[00:01:33.632 --> 00:01:40.873]  The Democratic Party, the entire corporate media, lined up against Infowars and the American people's free speech.
[00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:53.676]  The judge, more than 20 times in the last week and a half in Austin, Texas, told the jury while I was there in the courtroom, and it was on national TV, that Alex Jones is guilty.
[00:01:56.052 --> 00:02:03.416]  The lawyers for the plaintiffs asked for between $150 million and $3 billion.
[00:02:04.677 --> 00:02:09.879]  The jury came in this evening with $4.2 million.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.680]  I admitted I was wrong.
[00:02:12.221 --> 00:02:13.181]  I admitted I made a mistake.
[00:02:13.682 --> 00:02:16.983]  I admitted that I followed disinformation, but not on purpose.
[00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:18.684]  I apologized to the families.
[00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:21.606]  And the jury understood that.
[00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:26.548]  What I did to those families was wrong, but I didn't do it on purpose.
[00:02:27.268 --> 00:02:31.251]  I didn't lie about WMDs in Iraq and kill millions of people on purpose.
[00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:37.575]  I questioned a public event because I saw anomalies and others saw anomalies.
[00:02:38.356 --> 00:02:42.178]  And the jury understood that and awarded $4.2 million.
[00:02:42.518 --> 00:02:49.583]  Now that's more money than my company and I personally have, but we are going to work on trying to make restitution there.
[00:02:50.204 --> 00:02:51.825]  Now, here's the next phase of this.
[00:02:52.864 --> 00:03:09.894]  When the judge realized that when I was on the stand, I woke that jury up and laid out the facts, she ruled today that in the punitive damage phase that starts tomorrow, I cannot testify and my lawyer cannot put on evidence.
[00:03:10.654 --> 00:03:14.697]  So she already found me guilty and told the jury I was guilty.
[00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:21.849]  And now she's saying we can't defend ourselves in the punitive, damageless face.
[00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.491]  I trust in God.
[00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:25.212]  I trust in the truth coming out.
[00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:30.017]  At the end of the day, I don't have all these millions of dollars they claim I have, so I'm at peace.
[00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:37.243]  But this is still a major victory for truth, and the plaintiff's lawyers got upset in the courtroom.
[00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:45.693]  And according to multiple witnesses were screaming and yelling at my lawyers, Joe and Andino, when they were in the hall.
[00:03:46.433 --> 00:03:49.394]  They thought they would get hundreds of millions of dollars we don't have.
[00:03:49.914 --> 00:03:51.775]  They thought they would shut us down.
[00:03:52.755 --> 00:03:58.237]  But that jury understood the truth and resisted the propaganda.
[00:03:59.117 --> 00:04:00.338]  We'll be covering this tomorrow.
[00:04:01.351 --> 00:04:08.133]  On the Friday Show in detail, and the punitive damage section of this, but this is a big deal.
[00:04:08.453 --> 00:04:10.554]  Now listen, we're in bankruptcy right now.
[00:04:11.154 --> 00:04:11.974]  We're maxed out.
[00:04:12.014 --> 00:04:13.514]  We can barely keep the crew employed.
[00:04:14.094 --> 00:04:18.856]  We are fighting hard for your First Amendment, your Second Amendment, your Tenth Amendment, your sovereignty.
[00:04:19.336 --> 00:04:23.517]  So if you want to keep us in the fight, we have a plan to stay on air through this bankruptcy.
[00:04:23.557 --> 00:04:24.797]  We have a reorganization plan.
[00:04:25.237 --> 00:04:30.239]  But if you don't fund us, if you don't buy products at InfoWarsTore.com, we will shut down.
[00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:38.007]  It's your decision, just like that jury had a decision, right now on whether InfoWars is going to stay on the air.
[00:04:39.068 --> 00:04:44.514]  We are so broke that I'm not even worried about that $4.2 million.
[00:04:46.266 --> 00:04:52.310]  I'm worried about our bankruptcy to emergency stabilize InfoWars and we have a plan.
[00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.471]  But to do that, we need support.
[00:04:54.511 --> 00:05:07.620]  So get a t-shirt, get a book, get a film, get my new book The Great Reset and The War for the World, get Alex's War, get Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, get Vitamineral Fusion, get them all at InfoWarsTore.com and keep us on the air.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.162]  That is so critical because they use these families as pawns.
[00:05:12.343 --> 00:05:17.197]   The families come over and shook my hand and hug me and I was wrong.
[00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:18.178]  Sandy Hook happened.
[00:05:18.198 --> 00:05:18.958]  I admit it happened.
[00:05:18.978 --> 00:05:21.979]  I'm proud to admit it happened because when I'm wrong, I admit it.
[00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:26.061]  I don't make mistakes on purpose.
[00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:28.421]  We're tomorrow's losers today.
[00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:33.261]   I admit it happened. I'm proud to admit it happened because when I'm wrong I admit it.
[00:05:33.261 --> 00:05:38.261]   I don't make mistakes on purpose. We're tomorrow's losers today. We're 95% accurate.
[00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:42.261]   But these people tried to misrepresent what I said to these families.
[00:05:42.538 --> 00:05:43.999]  They showed them edited videos.
[00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.860]  They showed the jury edited videos.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.622]  And it backfired in their face big time.
[00:05:48.962 --> 00:05:54.526]  I told, and my lawyer told that jury, I said, listen, we want to pay for their psychological stuff.
[00:05:54.886 --> 00:05:56.047]  We want to take care of problems.
[00:05:56.247 --> 00:05:59.850]  We didn't cause all of it, but we want to step up and prove that and do that.
[00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.013]  And Scarlett Lewis has a beautiful organization called Choose Love.
[00:06:04.445 --> 00:06:15.350]  That isn't about gun control, isn't about liberal or conservative, it's about teaching children love and compassion so they're not hateful, so they're not satanic, so they don't kill people, and I have invited Scarlett Lewis on my show.
[00:06:16.171 --> 00:06:17.492]  We're going to email her organization.
[00:06:17.812 --> 00:06:36.122]   If I see her tomorrow, during the punitive phase, I'm going to shake her hand and give her my number, and I am going to gladly have her on my show next week, and I'm going to raise money for her organization on top of the big judgment because she's a real lady, she lost her
[00:06:36.122 --> 00:06:41.043]   child, and I'm not going to let these people misrepresent what I said and did anymore and
[00:06:41.043 --> 00:06:43.693]   claim that I'm the Sandy Hook man.
[00:06:43.693 --> 00:06:45.412]  This is a beautiful time.
[00:06:45.412 --> 00:06:46.973]  It's a great time.
[00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:50.612]  And the trial lawyers, the ambulance chasers lost.
[00:06:50.612 --> 00:06:53.612]  America and the First Amendment won.
[00:06:53.612 --> 00:06:56.373]  And the poor parents that went through so much.
[00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:59.182]  Neal Heslin and Scarlett Lewis, they have won as well.
[00:06:59.842 --> 00:07:01.884]  So this is a big victory, an answer to prayer.
[00:07:02.245 --> 00:07:03.686]  Thank you so much to the viewers and listeners.
[00:07:04.006 --> 00:07:05.988]  We're going to continue on as long as you support us.
[00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:11.893]  We were so close to being shut down, so please support us so we can have Scarlett Lewis and Neal Heslin on.
[00:07:11.913 --> 00:07:13.094]  I'm going to take them out to dinner.
[00:07:13.654 --> 00:07:15.275]  I'll see you tomorrow on the Friday Show.
[00:07:15.316 --> 00:07:17.297]  I'll be down there during the punitive damages.
[00:07:17.317 --> 00:07:19.238]  But this is a big victory against the tyrants and the New World Order.
[00:07:19.258 --> 00:07:20.039]  God bless and good luck.
