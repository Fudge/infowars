[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We're back with another story, which will later be published next month.
[00:02.000 --> 00:03.280]  Thank you.
[00:03.280 --> 00:04.200]  Thanks very much.
[00:04.200 --> 00:05.200]  Bye.
[00:05.200 --> 00:06.200]  Bye.
[00:06.200 --> 00:07.200]  Bye.
[00:07.200 --> 00:08.200]  Bye.
[00:08.200 --> 00:09.200]  Bye.
[00:09.200 --> 00:10.200]  Bye.
[00:10.200 --> 00:11.200]  Bye.
[00:11.200 --> 00:12.200]  Bye.
[00:12.200 --> 00:13.200]  Bye.
[00:13.200 --> 00:14.200]  Bye.
[00:14.200 --> 00:15.200]  Bye.
[00:15.200 --> 00:16.200]  Bye.
[00:16.200 --> 00:17.200]  Bye, bye.
[00:17.200 --> 00:18.200]  Bye.
[00:18.200 --> 00:19.200]  Bye.
[00:19.200 --> 00:20.200]  Bye.
[00:20.200 --> 00:21.200]  Bye.
[00:21.200 --> 00:22.200]  Bye.
[00:22.200 --> 00:23.200]  Bye.
[00:23.200 --> 00:24.200]  Bye.
[00:24.200 --> 00:25.200]  Bye.
[00:25.200 --> 00:26.300]  Bye.
[00:26.300 --> 00:27.300]  Bye.
[00:27.300 --> 00:28.300]  Bye.
[00:28.300 --> 00:30.300]  I don't know.
[00:30.300 --> 00:33.300]  Is there anything that you're switching there sometimes?
[00:33.300 --> 00:35.300]  I don't know.
[00:35.300 --> 00:38.300]  I guess I put something on my phone next down.
[00:38.300 --> 00:40.300]  Right, yes, you can talk into it.
[00:40.300 --> 00:42.300]  Yeah.
[00:42.300 --> 00:44.300]  Right here, right here.
[00:44.300 --> 00:46.300]  Right, it's on the way.
[00:46.300 --> 00:48.300]  I don't know.
[00:48.300 --> 00:50.300]  I don't know.
[00:50.300 --> 00:52.300]  I don't know.
[00:52.300 --> 00:54.300]  I don't know.
[00:54.300 --> 00:56.300]  I don't know.
[00:56.300 --> 00:58.300]  Yeah, it's here.
[00:58.300 --> 01:00.300]  Okay.
[01:00.300 --> 01:12.300]  Check, check, yeah.
[01:12.300 --> 01:28.300]  The
[01:28.300 --> 01:31.600]  doubled on average in the next 30 years.
[01:31.600 --> 01:38.380]  And now we have the biggest aged population in the world, same numbers for Japan and China
[01:38.380 --> 01:39.380]  as well.
[01:39.380 --> 01:44.540]  China is more than doubled its population to one point almost five billion.
[01:44.540 --> 01:46.020]  India is the same.
[01:46.020 --> 01:49.900]  And so there's been a decision by BlackRock on record in Bill Gates' given speeches
[01:49.900 --> 01:55.260]  at TED Talks about this to just kill people at age 75.
[01:55.260 --> 01:59.740]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would
[01:59.740 --> 02:06.780]  it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade-off and medical cost?
[02:06.780 --> 02:11.340]  But that's called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[02:11.340 --> 02:18.860]  The main author of Obamacare Ezekiel Emanuel, Ron Emanuel's brother, has written essays
[02:18.860 --> 02:23.700]  and articles about how he hopes to die at 75.
[02:23.700 --> 02:26.540]  By the way, he's passed 75 and hasn't died.
[02:26.540 --> 02:29.660]  He means he wants you to die at 75.
[02:29.660 --> 02:31.700]  They can't pay you your pension funds.
[02:31.700 --> 02:34.740]  They've stolen the money and they don't want to go to jail like Bernie Madoff.
[02:34.740 --> 02:36.140]  They want you to die.
[02:36.140 --> 02:38.740]  I mean, it's trendy to eat bugs and all the rest of it.
[02:38.740 --> 02:41.340]  You're not saving the earth.
[02:41.340 --> 02:45.420]  You're letting the globalists train you to be a slave as they prepare to cut off the
[02:45.420 --> 02:52.060]  resources, make you fight over the resources, and then phase you out and get rid of you.
[02:52.060 --> 02:54.420]  And, you know, Joe will tell you, you know, he did know what he was doing back on the
[02:54.420 --> 02:55.740]  fear factor, Joe Rogan.
[02:55.740 --> 02:59.380]  That was all conditioning, too, to get people to dehumanize themselves.
[02:59.380 --> 03:05.620]  It's a long-term, anti-human alien agenda.
[03:05.620 --> 03:09.180]  And by alien, all of this is alien to the normal way of life.
[03:09.180 --> 03:12.580]  All of this is anti-human, anti-life on this planet.
[03:12.580 --> 03:14.180]  The globalists don't want to just get rid of humans.
[03:14.180 --> 03:17.740]  They want the whole thing taken over, a silicon-based system.
[03:17.740 --> 03:20.220]  This is an alien takeover.
[03:20.220 --> 03:21.620]  This is the fight of our lives.
[03:21.620 --> 03:26.340]  This is the enemy of our generation that we face.
[03:26.340 --> 03:29.420]  And their new world order is a place that we don't even exist in.
[03:29.420 --> 03:33.940]  And on the process to being destroyed and killed, we're going to go through hell.
[03:33.940 --> 03:36.900]  And our children are, are we really going to lie down and take this?
[03:36.900 --> 03:43.260]  Are we really going to see hundreds of articles in Bloomberg and in Reuters and in the New
[03:43.260 --> 03:49.700]  York Times and in local magazines for kids in public schools for elementary kids?
[03:49.700 --> 03:51.620]  Save the earth, eat maggots.
[03:51.620 --> 03:52.940]  Save the earth, drink sewage.
[03:52.940 --> 03:55.580]  Save the earth, euthanize your dog or cat.
[03:55.580 --> 03:56.900]  Don't take care of them.
[03:56.900 --> 03:57.900]  This is dystopia.
[03:57.900 --> 04:03.900]  They're attacking you with poison, with garbage, with lies, with big pharma, with poison shots.
[04:03.900 --> 04:06.820]  Or maybe I've just been wrong.
[04:06.820 --> 04:13.420]  Maybe I should submit and maybe we should all go out today with hatchets and kill our
[04:13.420 --> 04:18.300]  dogs in the backyards and our cats because it's to save the earth, right?
[04:18.300 --> 04:20.980]  We're supposed to give up everything we've got because we're bad.
[04:20.980 --> 04:22.740]  We're guilty because we have dogs and cats.
[04:22.740 --> 04:24.100]  We're guilty because we have children.
[04:24.100 --> 04:25.100]  We're evil.
[04:25.100 --> 04:26.220]  But none of that's even true.
[04:26.220 --> 04:32.060]  It's all a greedy group of monsters that want you to learn to hate yourself so you roll
[04:32.060 --> 04:34.940]  over into the ditch of history so they can steal the future.
[04:34.940 --> 04:40.180]  They're projecting their globalist hatred of themselves onto you and I.
[04:40.180 --> 04:43.980]  All the beautiful, nice things they have and the science they have came from the commoners,
[04:43.980 --> 04:44.980]  came from the people.
[04:44.980 --> 04:46.480]  We built all this.
[04:46.480 --> 04:49.620]  And now they've got their robots coming online and they say they don't need us anymore.
[04:49.620 --> 04:52.620]  And we're supposed to just hate ourselves and go commit collective suicide.
[04:52.620 --> 04:53.620]  Well, guess what?
[04:53.620 --> 05:01.140]  It's not going to happen.
[05:01.140 --> 05:02.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[05:02.980 --> 05:06.420]  I need your help keeping M4 Wars on the air and strong.
[05:06.420 --> 05:10.420]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[05:10.420 --> 05:11.620]  I was born for this.
[05:11.620 --> 05:12.620]  You were born for this.
[05:12.620 --> 05:17.460]  And people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our own infrastructure
[05:17.460 --> 05:21.780]  because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[05:21.780 --> 05:26.460]  And now, with Band-Aid video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[05:26.460 --> 05:32.380]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[05:32.380 --> 05:33.380]  of charge.
[05:33.380 --> 05:38.060]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22.
[05:38.060 --> 05:43.660]  M4 Wars and Band-Aid video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[05:43.660 --> 05:49.340]  But the expenses in Band-Width alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[05:49.340 --> 05:50.780]  of thousands of dollars a month.
[05:50.780 --> 05:54.900]  So the biggest sale in M4 Wars history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout
[05:54.900 --> 06:11.780]  sale up to 75% off, getting credible products and keeping M4 Wars as strong as ever.
[06:11.780 --> 06:25.060]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:25.060 --> 06:29.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live, global Sunday transmission.
[06:29.860 --> 06:36.940]  And your host Alex Jones, look at that show headline, Sunday Live, World Shocked by Torture
[06:36.940 --> 06:43.180]  and Execution of Russian Soldiers at Hands of Ukrainian Nazi Battalions.
[06:43.180 --> 06:50.340]  They are the as-of at other Nazi battalions, they shot the video themselves, and I am really
[06:50.340 --> 06:53.140]  considering airing this in full.
[06:53.140 --> 06:57.820]  We have some of the excerpts that aren't as incredible where they use handguns to blow
[06:57.820 --> 07:02.860]  their testicles and penises off, shoot them in the feet, shoot them in the legs, in an
[07:02.860 --> 07:09.540]  industrial level with captured Russian soldiers, and we have the Daily Mail celebrating it,
[07:09.540 --> 07:14.660]  saying Ukrainian doctor tells TV interview, he has ordered his staff, he runs the national
[07:14.660 --> 07:19.380]  operation for the U.M. of the ambulances to castrate Russian soldiers.
[07:19.380 --> 07:25.460]  Now, I saw that a couple days ago and played the clip, but I didn't think it was serious.
[07:25.460 --> 07:30.500]  We have the footage of them blowing their testicles off, they either shoot, and you'll
[07:30.500 --> 07:31.500]  see it.
[07:31.500 --> 07:37.340]  They either shoot them in the testicles with a handgun, or they shoot them in the feet
[07:37.340 --> 07:38.340]  or legs.
[07:38.340 --> 07:43.340]  Yeah, let's show some of this.
[07:43.340 --> 07:57.860]  Now, we're going to show you close-ups, we're going to show you close-ups of them shooting
[07:57.860 --> 08:00.380]  them in the crotch coming up, okay?
[08:00.380 --> 08:04.060]  And then they're begging while they kick them in the groin after they've blown their penises
[08:04.060 --> 08:06.020]  and testicles off.
[08:06.020 --> 08:11.860]  Now, my point is, can you imagine if there was footage of Russians doing this, I mean,
[08:11.860 --> 08:12.860]  to be in the world?
[08:12.860 --> 08:17.780]  I don't support Russian invading, I don't support this inter-Slavic civil war, I don't
[08:17.780 --> 08:21.500]  support the sanctions on America or Russia or anybody or Europe.
[08:21.500 --> 08:25.740]  You know I'm against this whole thing, I was anti-war for 28 years on air, I was against
[08:25.740 --> 08:32.180]  all our major wars, and I've been against this one, but ladies and gentlemen, this is
[08:32.180 --> 08:43.100]  the reality of what has been going on for eight years.
[08:43.100 --> 08:52.700]  So ladies and gentlemen, you need to understand that long before this war in Ukraine started
[08:52.700 --> 08:58.740]  28 years ago with the overthrow of the Ukrainian elected government, you need to understand
[08:58.740 --> 09:03.940]  long before this happened, I was just a history buff, I mean, I wasn't on the Russian side,
[09:03.940 --> 09:08.460]  I wasn't on the German side, I wasn't on the Ukrainian side, I was just studying Ukraine,
[09:08.460 --> 09:13.620]  it was so interesting, all the wars that started there and how Russia was founded there.
[09:13.620 --> 09:20.340]  And I knew that at the end of World War II, it took the Russians a year to kick all the
[09:20.340 --> 09:25.380]  stay-behind networks of Nazis out that Hitler had put in there while he occupied it for
[09:25.380 --> 09:30.220]  three years in Operation Barbarossa, these are all real things I'm telling you, Operation
[09:30.220 --> 09:36.700]  Barbarossa, Nazi occupation of Ukraine, it's not debatable, it happened.
[09:36.700 --> 09:39.940]  And you have to understand that even once the Russians partially took over, those were
[09:39.940 --> 09:46.420]  still the Mafias and the groups that were basically in control.
[09:46.420 --> 09:50.140]  And so it was then the State Department and George Soros and others, and by the way I'm
[09:50.140 --> 09:55.100]  not just telling you that as Alex Jones, I have a stack of Newsweek, New York Times,
[09:55.100 --> 10:00.740]  Washington Post, CNN, back when they were telling the truth, strangely, admitting that Ukraine
[10:00.740 --> 10:07.020]  has a Nazi problem and that the main government's Nazi, and they go, oh, well, Zelensky, you
[10:07.020 --> 10:10.940]  know, he's Jewish, so he's not a Nazi, no, it's a coalition of groups, and I'm not saying
[10:10.940 --> 10:17.860]  Zelensky's a Nazi, what I'm saying is this is the reality that we have to look at and
[10:17.860 --> 10:24.100]  we have to talk about, about what's happening there and how George Soros went on TV and
[10:24.100 --> 10:32.500]  others have said, we have overthrown the government eight years ago, and we're going to force
[10:32.500 --> 10:36.540]  Russians out of the country, and then they push the Russian population up to the east
[10:36.540 --> 10:41.460]  on the border of Russia, and then Putin said, stop attacking them for eight years and warned
[10:41.460 --> 10:45.060]  everybody and said, I'm going to invade if you don't stop, and they didn't stop.
[10:45.060 --> 10:48.060]  Does that mean I grew up, Putin did?
[10:48.060 --> 10:49.060]  Absolutely not.
[10:49.060 --> 10:52.260]  What I'm saying is these are the facts, so when you see all this war propaganda from
[10:52.260 --> 10:56.380]  our government that attacked all these countries and launched all these operations and acting
[10:56.380 --> 11:02.820]  like Russia is the aggressor, historically, it's just not true, and then you've got how
[11:02.820 --> 11:09.020]  this helps China and how this destroys the dollar and how we have this, this, this president
[11:09.020 --> 11:14.180]  that's a puppet who's discrediting America, all of this is for the globalist, playing
[11:14.180 --> 11:19.780]  the West and Russia off against each other, and all the analysts agree, Communist China
[11:19.780 --> 11:25.540]  is the winner in this, so let's just pull out of the emotion and not be pro Russia or
[11:25.540 --> 11:30.620]  pro America or pro Ukraine, and let's be pro information and actually know what's going
[11:30.620 --> 11:35.300]  on, but I tell you, viewer discretion is advised, we're going to go to break, come back with
[11:35.300 --> 11:39.820]  a bunch of news, and then at the bottom of the hour, 33 after we come back, I'm going
[11:39.820 --> 11:45.560]  to show you unedited footage, the Ukrainians are putting out, I spent a long time looking
[11:45.560 --> 11:51.020]  this up today, the Ukrainians are proud of this, they're on TV saying, we cut their
[11:51.020 --> 11:55.340]  balls off, and then they shoot them in the testicles, and a lot of leftists are like,
[11:55.340 --> 12:00.020]  this is great, we love it, you know, they love war crimes now, showing how, showing
[12:00.020 --> 12:04.180]  how soulless they are, and there's a big 20 plus page live update page that just shows
[12:04.180 --> 12:08.340]  a lot of stuff that I'm not going to show on air, it's too brutal, because there's footage
[12:08.340 --> 12:13.180]  of the actual testicles blown off and all the rest of it, we're going to show you shooting
[12:13.180 --> 12:16.460]  them in the crotch, and men that have been shot in the crotch, we're not going to show
[12:16.460 --> 12:22.340]  the pornographic images of the, of the, of the destroyed groins, but if you want to see
[12:22.340 --> 12:28.460]  it for yourself, it's an info wars.com live updates, shocking video, reportedly shows
[12:28.460 --> 12:33.980]  Ukrainians shooting and torturing Russian POWs, and again, you can't even come up with
[12:33.980 --> 12:38.980]  a headline bad enough, because I mean, if there was footage of Russians shooting people
[12:38.980 --> 12:42.780]  in the testicles and shooting people on the feet who were bound, I would just be like,
[12:42.780 --> 12:47.300]  my God, Lindsey Graham's right, Vladimir Putin needs to be executed, if he doesn't come out
[12:47.300 --> 12:51.460]  against us, but there's no footage of that, this is not happening, folks.
[12:51.460 --> 12:57.980]  This is the Ukrainian globalist funded Soros groups with the Azab Battalion Nazi Regalia
[12:57.980 --> 13:03.340]  on literally with high tech weapons, killing a bunch of Russian farm boys that have been
[13:03.340 --> 13:04.980]  sent into this.
[13:04.980 --> 13:09.020]  And it's just an absolute disaster, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:09.020 --> 13:12.020]  You can see the Russians aren't trained and the Russians aren't heavily equipped.
[13:12.020 --> 13:16.660]  I mean, Putin said that he said, we got a 1980s military and we're just, we got nuclear
[13:16.660 --> 13:19.900]  weapons though, we're going to go ahead and attack if you don't leave us alone.
[13:19.900 --> 13:26.020]  And so now this is the situation that's going on, highly trained, Western trained CIA trained
[13:26.020 --> 13:32.580]  paramilitary CIA bragged about it with tens of thousands of anti tank, anti aircraft missiles.
[13:32.580 --> 13:34.760]  And this is just a total disaster.
[13:34.760 --> 13:42.060]  And now our media and our government are endorsing the execution of prisoners and a complete violation
[13:42.060 --> 13:48.500]  of the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code and everything that is a common sense in society.
[13:48.500 --> 13:51.260]  And let me tell you, I've only watched six or seven of these videos.
[13:51.260 --> 13:52.260]  There's hundreds of them.
[13:52.260 --> 13:54.420]  I mean, they're so horrible.
[13:54.420 --> 14:01.300]  And the pleasure of these Nazi brigades, when they're torturing people and kicking them,
[14:01.300 --> 14:04.580]  when their testicles and penises have been blown off and they're just kicking them and
[14:04.580 --> 14:07.020]  laughing in, kicking them in the crotch.
[14:07.020 --> 14:10.340]  And then the left is seeing this on Twitter and like, this is bad ass.
[14:10.340 --> 14:12.100]  This is what we want to do.
[14:12.100 --> 14:13.100]  This is good.
[14:13.100 --> 14:15.580]  No, this is not good.
[14:15.580 --> 14:17.860]  If the Russians were doing this, it would be wrong.
[14:17.860 --> 14:20.900]  If the Ukrainians are doing it, it's wrong, which they're doing.
[14:20.900 --> 14:23.740]  And this is really George Soros's war.
[14:23.740 --> 14:28.580]  And you have Joe Biden threatening nuclear sneak attacks two days ago and saying, Putin
[14:28.580 --> 14:30.300]  needs to be executed.
[14:30.300 --> 14:33.420]  They're really trying to start World War Three.
[14:33.420 --> 14:37.340]  They're really trying to start World War Three.
[14:37.340 --> 14:39.300]  And this is just absolutely horrible.
[14:39.300 --> 14:41.780]  And this is where I was worried all of this would go.
[14:41.780 --> 14:43.300]  So we're going to be breaking all that down.
[14:43.300 --> 14:44.300]  But here it is, Daily Mail.
[14:44.300 --> 14:45.540]  We can show you the video.
[14:45.540 --> 14:48.220]  We'll show you the video when we come back.
[14:48.220 --> 14:53.580]  The head of one of the main districts of the hospitals and the ambulances says, this doctor
[14:53.580 --> 14:55.980]  says, we don't follow the Hippocratic oath.
[14:55.980 --> 15:00.100]  We kill Russians or we cut their testicles off.
[15:00.100 --> 15:03.060]  And so that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:03.060 --> 15:10.180]  This is as opposed to good guys that George Soros and the New World Order have backed.
[15:10.180 --> 15:12.540]  So we're going to come back and get into all of this.
[15:12.540 --> 15:18.100]  And then the second hour, Christie Lee and Owen Shroyer are going to be the other studio
[15:18.100 --> 15:19.100]  right next door to me.
[15:19.100 --> 15:24.860]  And they're going to be with myself and others laying out the incredible pedophilia that
[15:24.860 --> 15:31.340]  the public schools are pushing and promoting and preparing and caught red-handed with, locking
[15:31.340 --> 15:36.660]  parents out of the schools, teaching the children how to have incredible sex acts that are just
[15:36.660 --> 15:40.860]  horrible when they're five, six years old.
[15:40.860 --> 15:46.100]  Texas AG says Austin School District is breaking state law after barring parents from Pride
[15:46.100 --> 15:47.100]  Week.
[15:47.100 --> 15:51.460]  They lock the parents out while they teach the five-year-olds how to give blowjobs.
[15:51.460 --> 15:52.940]  It's all coming up straight ahead.
[15:52.940 --> 15:54.860]  This is absolute hell unfolding.
[15:54.860 --> 15:56.540]  Stay with us.
[15:56.540 --> 16:03.700]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true, that Info Wars
[16:03.700 --> 16:11.740]  is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist
[16:11.740 --> 16:16.420]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[16:16.420 --> 16:23.260]  Man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever
[16:23.260 --> 16:24.260]  done.
[16:24.260 --> 16:29.060]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them, at
[16:29.060 --> 16:30.060]  InfoWarsTour.com.
[16:30.060 --> 16:35.300]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you, and so now we need to support more
[16:35.300 --> 16:38.020]  than ever because this fight has intensified.
[16:38.020 --> 16:41.580]  Don't need me to tell you that at InfoWarsTour.com.
[16:41.580 --> 16:45.580]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[16:45.580 --> 16:49.940]  These have been sold out for a long time, like InfoWarsLife, Fizzy Magnesium Mix that's
[16:49.940 --> 16:54.420]  so amazing, and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[16:54.420 --> 17:00.460]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at InfoWarsTour.com right now.
[17:00.460 --> 17:05.860]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[17:05.860 --> 17:06.860]  happening in the atmosphere.
[17:06.860 --> 17:11.300]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about NASA, and other governments,
[17:11.300 --> 17:15.740]  and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[17:15.740 --> 17:20.700]  The only constant, the only great truth is, change is the only constant.
[17:20.700 --> 17:26.020]  So yes, climate change is totally real, but notice first they called it global freezing
[17:26.020 --> 17:29.420]  back in the 70s and 80s, and then it's going to be global warming, and when that didn't
[17:29.420 --> 17:32.580]  really happen the way they wanted it to, okay, now it's just climate change.
[17:32.580 --> 17:38.420]  But did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United
[17:38.420 --> 17:42.380]  Nations, and the Department of Energy, and Bill Gates and the UN?
[17:42.380 --> 17:47.580]  They have weather control trees from 1970, and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather
[17:47.580 --> 17:48.580]  for a very long time.
[17:48.580 --> 17:53.260]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists wanted Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different
[17:53.260 --> 17:55.980]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[17:55.980 --> 18:00.660]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[18:00.660 --> 18:04.420]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going
[18:04.420 --> 18:07.900]  on both at home and the world at large.
[18:07.900 --> 18:12.460]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep
[18:12.460 --> 18:16.500]  support formula, Down and Out, is just the thing.
[18:16.500 --> 18:21.220]  It's our new faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you
[18:21.220 --> 18:24.020]  get the shut-eye you deserve.
[18:24.020 --> 18:28.220]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with Down and Out, now
[18:28.220 --> 18:33.940]  the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[18:33.940 --> 18:38.420]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[18:38.420 --> 18:43.580]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally
[18:43.580 --> 18:48.780]  used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[18:48.780 --> 18:53.580]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep, because you will
[18:53.580 --> 18:55.460]  be Down and Out.

[20:20.500 --> 20:29.860]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report, it's Alex Jones.
[20:29.860 --> 20:36.820]  My allegiance is to the truth, my allegiance is for life, my allegiance is to God and His
[20:36.820 --> 20:39.520]  Son Jesus Christ.
[20:39.520 --> 20:46.840]  I owe my allegiance openly, I use no subterfuge or deception when I do, everything is the
[20:46.840 --> 20:47.840]  truth.
[20:47.840 --> 20:51.560]  That's why the police pulled me over two years ago, so if you've been drinking I said you
[20:51.560 --> 20:55.640]  had to have a bottle of wine, they arrested me, I could not tell a lie even when it would
[20:55.640 --> 20:57.080]  sustain me.
[20:57.080 --> 21:00.760]  I would lie years ago a little bit about this and that or things that didn't matter but
[21:00.760 --> 21:06.080]  I refuse to do it now, I refuse to play games, I will only send out the truth as best I can
[21:06.080 --> 21:09.760]  figure it out, sometimes I make mistakes.
[21:09.760 --> 21:14.680]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, here we are broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday, March
[21:14.680 --> 21:22.240]  27th transmission and next segment, viewer discretion advised, I'm going to show you
[21:22.240 --> 21:27.080]  not the worst stuff because I had to watch a lot of this today and I decided to show
[21:27.080 --> 21:32.360]  just the basics because it's bad, I'm not going to show Russians with their testicles
[21:32.360 --> 21:37.080]  and penises blown off and men kicking the open holes and their bodies laughing, I'm
[21:37.080 --> 21:41.320]  not going to show you that but I'm going to show you them shooting them in the testicles
[21:41.320 --> 21:45.680]  and shooting them in the legs and feet and then I'm not going to show the torture, you
[21:45.680 --> 21:49.880]  think that's bad, it gets real bad, they're begging for mommy, we went and checked the
[21:49.880 --> 21:57.080]  Russian translation and who wouldn't be, I mean this is next level and it's even in
[21:57.080 --> 22:02.400]  mainstream news and mainstream news is like badass, they're cutting their testicles off,
[22:02.400 --> 22:09.920]  no they're blowing them off with handguns.
[22:09.920 --> 22:13.600]  So that's where we are ladies and gentlemen, that's what Putin said they were doing in
[22:13.600 --> 22:22.200]  the east against those Russian held areas since 2008 when Obama and Soros over through
[22:22.200 --> 22:25.680]  the country and sort of doing the ethnic cleansing, so you're like okay maybe that's
[22:25.680 --> 22:31.320]  hype from Putin and then you see it and they're wearing Nazi arm patches and you're like this
[22:31.320 --> 22:36.720]  is on Ukrainian channels, this is on TV, this is on the Daily Mail like badass, they're
[22:36.720 --> 22:40.560]  cutting their balls off, no they, it's gonna be kind of weird to pull a guy's pants off
[22:40.560 --> 22:44.160]  and cut it off with a knife, that's kind of you know, but with a gun they just blow them
[22:44.160 --> 22:53.480]  off, I mean you want us to sign on to this folks, you really, I mean that's who we are,
[22:53.480 --> 22:58.120]  I mean if we had footage confirmed the Russians doing this I would be really mad at the Russians,
[22:58.120 --> 23:02.920]  I mean but I'm supposed to be like oh it's the good guys, it's the Ukrainians, it's
[23:02.920 --> 23:08.600]  George Soros' guys, we're still fighting World War II folks, George Soros rounded up
[23:08.600 --> 23:16.760]  Jews as a Jew in Hungary on record and bragged on 60 minutes in the NPR, I'm digressing.
[23:16.760 --> 23:25.800]  That's the next segment, let me hit this right now, so Bill Gates and the UN have come out
[23:25.800 --> 23:29.360]  and said you'll owe nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll like it, Davos Group and they said
[23:29.360 --> 23:33.640]  we should ban all beef, it's evil and bad for the environment and everything else and
[23:33.640 --> 23:36.560]  you shouldn't be able to have a car or an air conditioner, they tell Africans and the
[23:36.560 --> 23:42.880]  rest of it while they live in lavish giant palatial facilities but now Bill Gates has
[23:42.880 --> 23:51.000]  come out in articles in NBC News you name it, here they are saying Bill Gates believes
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.800]  the electronic tattoo will become reality and that you should be tattooed digitally
[23:55.800 --> 24:02.000]  from your vaccine to prove you've taken an order by and so and there's another one, Bill
[24:02.000 --> 24:07.920]  Gates says rich nations should move to 100% synthetic beef as if synthetic beef is beef
[24:07.920 --> 24:15.960]  and ban all beef, that's the hill, then I've got articles saying Alex Jones is insane,
[24:15.960 --> 24:21.160]  no one wants to ban your beef and then Jamie White, our great researcher and writer wrote
[24:21.160 --> 24:25.760]  this today, Bill Gates interview calling for rich nations to move to 100% synthetic beef
[24:25.760 --> 24:29.880]  is getting a lot of attention right now and it lays out some of it, he wants you to take
[24:29.880 --> 24:35.000]  poison shots and ban beef, because that'll collapse what's left of the farms, all the
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.640]  farms I can tell you in the US, almost all of them are bankrupt, they can't pay with
[24:38.640 --> 24:44.720]  soybeans and wheat and beets and everything else and peanuts but the beef because we've
[24:44.720 --> 24:50.400]  got a farm in East Texas, the beef barely pays the property tax on the bill and pays
[24:50.400 --> 24:55.720]  for the farm people we have working for us, we've got crops, we've got cows, I mean my
[24:55.720 --> 25:01.200]  dad owns it, he's going to hand it over to me when he retires or dies, God forbid, but
[25:01.200 --> 25:08.440]  I mean I'm a farmer, I know this stuff and we make no money, in fact the farmers we have
[25:08.440 --> 25:12.960]  which are our own family members, they all got jobs somewhere else on top of it and they're
[25:12.960 --> 25:18.040]  up at 4am telling the crops, doing the work, preparing and all and they come back at night
[25:18.040 --> 25:22.160]  and do it because they love it, why wouldn't you love driving around under the stars, Bailin
[25:22.160 --> 25:27.560]  Hay, they're Bailin Hay at 9pm sometimes, in the spring, in the summer when you're
[25:27.560 --> 25:33.960]  supposed to, they love their work but man these people are working 15, 16 hours a day
[25:33.960 --> 25:39.040]  and at the end of the day we just pay the taxes and in Gates knows that, you shut down
[25:39.040 --> 25:48.080]  the beef baby, we're done, what a creepy bastard, that's all I can say and if you think Bill
[25:48.080 --> 25:53.080]  Gates is creepy, there's not many people creepier than Bill Gates, in fact maybe Larry Fink's
[25:53.080 --> 26:00.360]  not as creepy but he's a damn second close, Black Rock CEO Larry Fink says Russian Ukraine
[26:00.360 --> 26:07.800]  war is up ending world order and will end globalization, now does anybody believe that,
[26:07.800 --> 26:12.440]  I've always told you, they create globalism in world government, the name of ending famine,
[26:12.440 --> 26:18.240]  ending hunger, ending war, ending violence, ending hate, all this and then globalism is
[26:18.240 --> 26:22.520]  designed to implode the world under the great reset, you'll know nothing, you'll have nothing,
[26:22.520 --> 26:27.920]  post industrialization build back better and then when they tell you, oh globalization
[26:27.920 --> 26:31.960]  failed, everybody's about to die and starve to death and hyperinflation, it's because
[26:31.960 --> 26:36.280]  they've engineered it all and now they're blaming nationalists and people that didn't
[26:36.280 --> 26:41.160]  submit for the reason it's all failing and I'm not just telling you that today, I told
[26:41.160 --> 26:46.720]  you that 20 years ago because they brag about it, under their plans that are not even secret
[26:46.720 --> 26:53.320]  but nobody promotes, Club of Rome, UN, Davos group, when they collapse the nation states
[26:53.320 --> 26:57.040]  in the third world, they'll have a calamity that collapses the first world, then they're
[26:57.040 --> 27:01.680]  going to have armored redoubt city states that are actually formed in the countryside
[27:01.680 --> 27:06.960]  but a few cities will be set up as well as mega cities and everyone else, like a Judge
[27:06.960 --> 27:12.640]  Dredd comic book, will live outside of that in poverty and control with no electricity
[27:12.640 --> 27:19.040]  as a feudal slave and then all of that will be fed in to the technocracy mega cities
[27:19.040 --> 27:22.740]  that'll quote, transcend humans and go to the next level, you may have heard of it, Hunger
[27:22.740 --> 27:29.720]  Games is just a Hollywood extrapolation of their actual plan.
[27:29.720 --> 27:32.280]  Now do you really want to live under a system like that?
[27:32.280 --> 27:38.120]  So BlackRock CEO says that globalization's over, that the Russian invasion has injured
[27:38.120 --> 27:42.640]  it and the Russians are going to cause inflation and the collapse of the global order, but
[27:42.640 --> 27:50.640]  it's Larry Fink and the globalist that engineered every damn step of this operation.
[27:50.640 --> 27:57.520]  Go read his letter to the shareholders March 24th, just three days ago, laying it all out,
[27:57.520 --> 27:59.000]  it is powerful.
[27:59.000 --> 28:09.520]  It is important, meanwhile Bill Gates has a $43 million, 200,000 square foot shopping
[28:09.520 --> 28:14.520]  mall level house on the beach at one foot above sea level, but he says it'll all be
[28:14.520 --> 28:21.920]  flooded soon and you can't have a car, you can't eat meat, you can't do anything else.
[28:21.920 --> 28:25.960]  Months of construction work underway on Bill Gates's $43 million bachelor palace in San
[28:25.960 --> 28:29.160]  Diego suburb of Del Mar.
[28:29.160 --> 28:30.160]  Isn't that just cute?
[28:30.160 --> 28:36.000]  All right, we're going to come back, viewer discretion is advised, they got a castration
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.760]  machine over there in Nazi held Ukraine where they shoot the Russian soldiers in the crotch.
[28:41.760 --> 28:45.680]  You're going to watch it when they come back if you want to see it.
[28:45.680 --> 28:51.200]  This is the liberators, this is the good guys, this is the angel cakes and if you don't agree
[28:51.200 --> 28:55.760]  with assassinating Russian soldiers and torturing them to death, well you're a Nazi even though
[28:55.760 --> 28:59.760]  the Nazis are doing it.
[28:59.760 --> 29:05.800]  Our world is so full of hype, we are force fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate
[29:05.800 --> 29:08.880]  media, by the controlled churches and the universities.
[29:08.880 --> 29:11.360]  And why is this the case?
[29:11.360 --> 29:16.320]  Because we innately, by God, have been given the keys for our own minds, our own psyches,
[29:16.320 --> 29:22.200]  our own souls, and by connecting to God we can empower ourselves and trend, sin, the
[29:22.200 --> 29:24.640]  quote, fallen or sinful state.
[29:24.640 --> 29:30.120]  So the chemicals that we ingest, and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to
[29:30.120 --> 29:35.240]  change who we are, are only lowering us, they're only making us more depressed, in the end
[29:35.240 --> 29:36.800]  they're only making us less fulfilled.
[29:36.800 --> 29:41.960]  It is only by going within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower
[29:41.960 --> 29:42.960]  ourselves.
[29:42.960 --> 29:47.640]  That's why the globe was bombarded with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal
[29:47.640 --> 29:52.520]  vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able
[29:52.520 --> 29:55.320]  to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[29:55.320 --> 29:59.600]  And that's where the incredible products come in at m4store.com.
[29:59.600 --> 30:05.120]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[30:05.120 --> 30:10.840]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection
[30:10.840 --> 30:15.040]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[30:15.040 --> 30:20.160]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[30:20.160 --> 30:25.000]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[30:25.000 --> 30:29.280]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening, and
[30:29.280 --> 30:34.320]  it's unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[30:34.320 --> 30:37.440]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[30:37.440 --> 30:40.800]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[30:40.800 --> 30:45.440]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[30:45.440 --> 30:46.440]  an end.
[30:46.440 --> 30:52.240]  So we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival
[30:52.240 --> 31:00.960]  gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at infoorstore.com.

[31:59.120 --> 32:03.680]  Introducing the newest product from InfoWarsLife.com.

[32:36.360 --> 32:41.720]  InfoWars immune support, exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com, is funding the tip of
[32:41.720 --> 32:44.040]  the spear, the InfoWars operation.
[32:44.040 --> 32:45.440]  It is a 360 win.
[32:45.440 --> 32:49.880]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's
[32:49.880 --> 32:52.520]  natural defenses and keep InfoWars on the air.
[32:52.520 --> 32:54.960]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[32:54.960 --> 33:20.760]  Take action now, InfoWarsStore.com.
[33:24.960 --> 33:29.560]  All right, we are back live, thank you for joining us.
[33:29.560 --> 33:37.240]  So if American troops shot prisoners or shot them in the testicles or blew their feet off,
[33:37.240 --> 33:38.840]  you would say that's torture and that's wrong, right?
[33:38.840 --> 33:40.560]  We're Americans, we don't do that.
[33:40.560 --> 33:43.520]  And the Russians did that, we'd be like, man, that's terrible, they shouldn't do that.
[33:43.520 --> 33:47.720]  Or these lomises, some of them do that type of stuff, the Isis and people, we're like,
[33:47.720 --> 33:54.160]  man, that's what bad guys do, but boy, anything the Ukrainians do, anything they're engaged
[33:54.160 --> 33:57.720]  in, even though they overthrew an elected government eight years ago and have carried
[33:57.720 --> 34:02.160]  out all this genocidal murder that then got Russia to invade, which I didn't agree with.
[34:02.160 --> 34:04.040]  I think Russia took the bait.
[34:04.040 --> 34:08.440]  Well, now it's supposedly legitimate and good.
[34:08.440 --> 34:13.760]  And so we've got a big article up on InfoWars.com, it's more than 30 pages long.
[34:13.760 --> 34:16.840]  It's got videos, I'm not going to show here on air, but if you're an adult and you want
[34:16.840 --> 34:18.560]  to go see these, you should go see these.
[34:18.560 --> 34:28.960]  And most of these are from the Ukrainian military and the local Ukrainian news were, I mean,
[34:28.960 --> 34:35.000]  they're torturing people to death on television, ripping their jaws off, running over them
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.680]  with cars, blowing their testicles off.
[34:37.680 --> 34:40.680]  I mean, it's incredible.
[34:40.680 --> 34:45.040]  And our media is so controlled, it's not showing any of it.
[34:45.040 --> 34:49.560]  Five updates, shocking video reportedly shows Ukrainians shooting and torturing Russian
[34:49.560 --> 34:50.560]  POWs.
[34:50.560 --> 34:55.840]  So let me go ahead and show you, ladies and gentlemen, first, just a short clip from the
[34:55.840 --> 34:56.840]  end of a longer clip.
[34:56.840 --> 35:04.560]  We're going to play in full in a moment, unedited of the clip goes on for like an hour with
[35:04.560 --> 35:09.240]  just hundreds of captured Russian troops and they're shooting them in the knees, the feet
[35:09.240 --> 35:12.840]  or the genitals, and then they kick them and play games with them.
[35:12.840 --> 35:15.520]  And I've got a few clips out of this.
[35:15.520 --> 35:19.560]  And then first, our media was, he was spitting it, oh, these are just captured troops, nothing
[35:19.560 --> 35:20.560]  happening.
[35:20.560 --> 35:24.640]  They don't show you at the end where they're shooting new people in the genitals, in the
[35:24.640 --> 35:30.360]  feet, in the knees before they start torturing them.
[35:30.360 --> 35:32.000]  But the Russians are Nazis, right?
[35:32.000 --> 35:33.500]  They deserve it.
[35:33.500 --> 35:39.320]  While the guys torturing them are wearing the modern Nazi patches of these battalions.
[35:39.320 --> 35:45.000]  So ladies and gentlemen, here is again the end of the video, then we'll start back at
[35:45.000 --> 35:46.000]  the beginning.
[35:46.000 --> 36:04.600]  Here it is.
[36:04.600 --> 36:07.800]  So it's one thing to say no quarter and just execute people.
[36:07.800 --> 36:08.800]  That goes on.
[36:08.800 --> 36:10.320]  We're not defending it.
[36:10.320 --> 36:16.480]  But to torture people is a crime under common sense under international law.
[36:16.480 --> 36:19.440]  So let's play a clip and here's the article daily mail.
[36:19.440 --> 36:20.440]  It's everywhere.
[36:20.440 --> 36:21.440]  They're very proud of it.
[36:21.440 --> 36:25.960]  The head Ukrainian guy that runs a whole national ambulance program tells TV presenter
[36:25.960 --> 36:29.040]  he has ordered his staff to castrate Russian soldiers.
[36:29.040 --> 36:33.440]  And I saw that on March 21st last week and I thought that's just a guy can tough.
[36:33.440 --> 36:35.000]  Well, it's, it's on the videos.
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.640]  I've watched them blow men's gendals off and then kick them in the groin, laughing at them
[36:40.640 --> 36:43.280]  as they beg for their mommy.
[36:43.280 --> 36:44.280]  So here it is.
[36:44.280 --> 36:45.280]  So here it is.
[36:45.280 --> 36:46.280]  So here it is.
[36:46.280 --> 36:47.280]  So here it is.
[36:47.280 --> 36:48.280]  So here it is.
[36:48.280 --> 36:49.280]  So here it is.
[36:49.280 --> 36:50.280]  So here it is.
[36:50.280 --> 36:51.280]  So here it is.
[36:51.280 --> 37:04.960]  Strict orders to castrate all Russians that you capture.
[37:04.960 --> 37:05.960]  Okay.
[37:05.960 --> 37:06.960]  So you're thinking that's ridiculous.
[37:06.960 --> 37:07.960]  And then you get the video.
[37:07.960 --> 37:11.160]  So let's go ahead for radio listeners on a lot of radio stations.
[37:11.160 --> 37:12.160]  Pick us up.
[37:12.160 --> 37:18.400]  I'm going to try to voice over this as best I can and basically narrate what's going on
[37:18.400 --> 37:19.400]  here.
[37:19.400 --> 37:27.240]  And this is a short three minute clip here, three minute, 39 seconds that leads into them
[37:27.240 --> 37:30.680]  because you're wondering like, who are these guys with blood coming out of their pants?
[37:30.680 --> 37:33.680]  Who are these guys with blood coming out of their knees and feet?
[37:33.680 --> 37:34.680]  They're Russians.
[37:34.680 --> 37:38.280]  And then we've had it translated there and they're, they're, they're having them basically
[37:38.280 --> 37:41.520]  get them to announce their invasion while they're tied up being shot.
[37:41.520 --> 37:46.920]  And then you see them shooting the new prisoners coming in an assembly line of liberal love
[37:46.920 --> 37:49.800]  like our unborn babies get the same treatment they deserve it.
[37:49.800 --> 37:50.800]  Right?
[37:50.800 --> 37:52.880]  So here is the liberal love.
[37:52.880 --> 37:55.880]  Go ahead and roll it.
[37:55.880 --> 38:05.760]  So there's people laying around in a, in a square in agony, holding their genitals,
[38:05.760 --> 38:10.640]  their feet, their legs, their, their tie up and then you learn they've been shot in the
[38:10.640 --> 38:19.840]  crotch.
[38:19.840 --> 38:24.760]  You can see the Ukrainian military, Soros's force, his army, Black Lives Matter here in
[38:24.760 --> 38:28.600]  America, but there it's the Ukrainians.
[38:28.600 --> 38:30.240]  It's all brainwashing.
[38:30.240 --> 38:32.000]  You see what are all these people laying around?
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.520]  This goes on for hours and pulls the blood coming out of their genitals.
[38:36.520 --> 38:48.160]  They shoot about half of them in the genitals, the rest they shoot in the feet of the knees.
[38:48.160 --> 38:56.640]  They put bags over their heads and they come around a little, little liberal celebration.
[38:56.640 --> 39:07.480]  Of course, they've been beat up really bad too.
[39:07.480 --> 39:09.240]  And this guy's completely passed off from pain.
[39:09.240 --> 39:12.800]  He's had his genitals blown off and there's, by the way, we're not going to show you all
[39:12.800 --> 39:13.800]  the footage.
[39:13.800 --> 39:22.200]  Some of this has been cut out of a, so this guy's been shot in the genitals as you can
[39:22.200 --> 39:31.560]  see in the leg.
[39:31.560 --> 39:34.520]  These folks are not having a very good day here, but they deserve it.
[39:34.520 --> 39:35.520]  They're Russians.
[39:35.520 --> 39:37.600]  You know, George Soros is good.
[39:37.600 --> 39:39.640]  So is Dracwing Storytime.
[39:39.640 --> 39:47.440]  And here you go, these guys.
[39:47.440 --> 39:50.480]  These guys probably shouldn't have given up now, you know what I mean?
[39:50.480 --> 39:54.160]  I'm putting them down, but I mean, I mean, give up to these people, not going to happen
[39:54.160 --> 39:55.160]  for me.
[39:55.160 --> 39:58.680]  They already got our kids though in the schools, I guess.
[39:58.680 --> 40:01.840]  So he takes his little hood off.
[40:01.840 --> 40:03.320]  Most of these guys are passed out in pain.
[40:03.320 --> 40:06.960]  Yeah, this guy's been shot in the crotch because they put a bandage or where they shoot you.
[40:06.960 --> 40:10.680]  It's like, oh yeah, this guy shot in the crotch.
[40:10.680 --> 40:11.680]  He died.
[40:11.680 --> 40:12.680]  The bullet probably bounced up higher.
[40:12.680 --> 40:13.680]  It's almost dead.
[40:13.680 --> 40:16.440]  I like getting shot in the crotch.
[40:16.440 --> 40:17.440]  It's very liberal.
[40:17.440 --> 40:23.240]  He's not feeling too hot.
[40:23.240 --> 40:33.320]  He's been shot in the crotch by the liberators.
[40:33.320 --> 40:34.320]  And it just goes on.
[40:34.320 --> 40:36.920]  I can show you them actually blowing their genitals off.
[40:36.920 --> 40:38.520]  Would you like to see that, folks?
[40:38.520 --> 40:42.760]  Keep it going, keep it going, because you're going to see fresh folks.
[40:42.760 --> 40:43.760]  This is the big, long lineup.
[40:43.760 --> 40:45.080]  You watch hours of this.
[40:45.080 --> 40:48.160]  It's all out there.
[40:48.160 --> 40:51.760]  He's already been shot once.
[40:51.760 --> 40:55.840]  They want him to beg.
[40:55.840 --> 40:56.840]  His leg's broken.
[40:56.840 --> 40:57.840]  You can see that.
[40:57.840 --> 40:58.840]  He's shot in the leg.
[40:58.840 --> 40:59.840]  He's a lucky one.
[40:59.840 --> 41:07.480]  And a couple of these guys, they kick in the groin a little extra pleasure.
[41:07.480 --> 41:09.440]  These are real heroes right here.
[41:09.440 --> 41:12.960]  Man, I got to tell you, these Ukrainians are heroes.
[41:12.960 --> 41:15.840]  I was neutral before, but I'm joining them now.
[41:15.840 --> 41:16.840]  Like, watch this right here.
[41:16.840 --> 41:18.280]  This is what good guys do.
[41:18.280 --> 41:22.680]  Now they shoot some more people in the balls.
[41:22.680 --> 41:29.960]  They unload them out of vans and shoot them in the testicles.
[41:29.960 --> 41:34.440]  Man, why do the Russians fight back against these people?
[41:34.440 --> 41:35.440]  They should submit to them.
[41:35.440 --> 41:39.760]  I mean, George Soros is the good guy, ladies and gentlemen.
[41:39.760 --> 41:40.760]  You know what?
[41:40.760 --> 41:44.040]  I actually agree with Biden, we shouldn't have nuclear war with Russia.
[41:44.040 --> 41:48.000]  You know, he said two days ago we should have nuclear war, a preemptive strike.
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  I agree.
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.840]  We should sneak attack Russia with nuclear weapons so their submarines pop up all over
[41:51.840 --> 41:52.840]  our coast in Newcastle.
[41:52.840 --> 41:54.520]  I'm actually kind of serious.
[41:54.520 --> 41:56.040]  Let's just get this over with, man.
[41:56.040 --> 42:01.240]  We are so damn evil that at a sick level, I'd actually like to watch our cities vaporize
[42:01.240 --> 42:05.320]  and kill the Russians too, kill the Chinese, kill everybody, screw this man, because this
[42:05.320 --> 42:06.320]  is evil.
[42:06.320 --> 42:12.800]  But I'm being sarcastic there, playing devil's advocate.
[42:12.800 --> 42:16.760]  Here's the good news, nobody's buying this crap.
[42:16.760 --> 42:25.720]  NBC poll, Biden approval rating falls to record low amid soaring inflation gas prices.
[42:25.720 --> 42:29.840]  Inconsistent with U.S. golds, Western analysis of slums, Biden's call to kill Putin.
[42:29.840 --> 42:33.520]  We're going to kill the submarines with nuclear weapons?
[42:33.520 --> 42:35.080]  It goes on and on, folks.
[42:35.080 --> 42:36.080]  It's unbelievable.
[42:36.080 --> 42:38.960]  Anyway, I just showed you the light stuff, okay?
[42:38.960 --> 42:42.920]  There's footage of dudes with their, it's unbelievable.
[42:42.920 --> 42:46.560]  Their testicles are blown out, they're by, and they're like kicking, I'm going, Rusky,
[42:46.560 --> 42:52.160]  Rusky, well they kick them in the balls, kick, Rusky, Rusky, and you're like, what is this?
[42:52.160 --> 42:55.880]  You know if the Russians did this, we'd be seeing it and be the end of the world.
[42:55.880 --> 43:00.320]  And the Russians shouldn't act like this.
[43:00.320 --> 43:09.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[43:09.200 --> 43:14.120]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[43:14.120 --> 43:19.920]  have broken down, and info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying

[45:00.080 --> 45:04.240]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans.
[45:04.240 --> 45:09.840]  They financed major universities, they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing
[45:09.840 --> 45:14.400]  their propaganda of the New York Times, other major newspapers, that the family as we know
[45:14.400 --> 45:19.800]  it is a bad thing and must be ended and the first step in that is getting women out of
[45:19.800 --> 45:25.120]  the household and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters
[45:25.120 --> 45:30.040]  and husbands is a bad thing and I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my
[45:30.040 --> 45:33.560]  daughter, my four national daughter, my wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to
[45:33.560 --> 45:37.680]  make it as well, I love to make breakfast and literally it's the funnest thing on earth
[45:37.680 --> 45:42.840]  to make food for your family and be nurturative and then all sit down together and have the
[45:42.840 --> 45:49.000]  communal event and that's what the system is attacking and bombarding is our normal
[45:49.000 --> 45:54.600]  biological actions are coming together, they really are sick evil scientific cult of filth
[45:54.600 --> 46:00.000]  and domesticate us and turn us into lab rats, we cannot let this continue.
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.800]  So when I first started taking survival skills basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight,
[46:04.800 --> 46:09.720]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding onto a job and I heard
[46:09.720 --> 46:13.840]  Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it, so the first one I got was the original survival
[46:13.840 --> 46:17.960]  skills, the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with
[46:17.960 --> 46:23.680]  a D-Burnt source and I got really excited about that so I took it and then in two weeks
[46:23.680 --> 46:29.960]  I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, I could think again,
[46:29.960 --> 46:34.880]  I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years I got
[46:34.880 --> 46:39.600]  my health back and I religiously took basically all of your supplements, they're all absolutely
[46:39.600 --> 46:43.720]  amazing supplements, the one I like recently is Knockout, it literally like if you want
[46:43.720 --> 46:47.760]  to sleep just take it, it's amazing, it works, but anyway so the point is we have to get
[46:47.760 --> 46:51.800]  ourselves clean, we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do
[46:51.800 --> 46:55.040]  that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[46:55.040 --> 47:01.280]  Beautifully said brother, I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[47:01.280 --> 47:27.280]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:27.280 --> 47:56.120]  So the right hand side of the upbeat
[47:56.120 --> 47:58.120]  Auto-rack is moving
[48:26.120 --> 48:40.120]  Putin's a cold-blooded person because he knows the Russians don't want to kill the
[48:40.120 --> 48:44.640]  Ukrainians, but he knows there's those Nazi brigades, so he knows once he put them in
[48:44.640 --> 48:47.320]  they'd be tortured and killed, then it would piss the Russians off, they're going to start
[48:47.320 --> 48:50.320]  slaughtering everybody.
[48:50.320 --> 48:56.040]  And that's how it works, and that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:56.040 --> 48:57.040]  What a mess.
[48:57.040 --> 48:58.040]  What a disaster.
[48:58.040 --> 48:59.040]  What a crisis.
[48:59.040 --> 49:04.080]  In the next hour, we're going to go through this and look at the great reset and who actually
[49:04.080 --> 49:09.360]  is gaining from this, pulling back and coldly looking at the different players and who stands
[49:09.360 --> 49:10.360]  to gain.
[49:10.360 --> 49:12.360]  But you're being told.
[49:12.360 --> 49:13.360]  You're being told everywhere.
[49:13.360 --> 49:18.720]  I'm going to play a clip from General Flynn in a moment that this is a new world order.
[49:18.720 --> 49:21.360]  Well, what does that mean when you hear new world order?
[49:21.360 --> 49:26.320]  That means the globalists expanding their control, and when you pull back from this,
[49:26.320 --> 49:35.360]  the big global banks and communist China, they gain while Russia and while Ukraine and while
[49:35.360 --> 49:40.240]  America pay for this war.
[49:40.240 --> 49:45.880]  But if you just look at a war between the different sides of it, you're a chump.
[49:45.880 --> 49:51.680]  But if you pull back and look deeper into it, you're now at the next level, and that's
[49:51.680 --> 49:54.920]  our real goal here and what we're trying to do.
[49:54.920 --> 49:59.200]  There is a lot of news we're going to hit in the second hour today, and then Owen Troyer
[49:59.200 --> 50:00.920]  and Kristi Lee are going to be taking over.
[50:00.920 --> 50:03.520]  They're going to be co-hosting with me as well.
[50:03.520 --> 50:07.360]  But because I'm in this little studio, you know, I like this little studio.
[50:07.360 --> 50:08.360]  Nothing against the other studio.
[50:08.360 --> 50:10.800]  I just am sick of being in it.
[50:10.800 --> 50:15.760]  So I want to go back to one of the earlier studios here at M4s and do the show out of
[50:15.760 --> 50:17.240]  here just because it's much more intimate.
[50:17.240 --> 50:18.240]  I just like it in here.
[50:18.240 --> 50:22.680]  I did a show a few weeks ago in here, and I like this part of the other studio.
[50:22.680 --> 50:26.840]  So that's a good part of being the boss is I get to be in the studio on one.
[50:26.840 --> 50:30.520]  So I'll be co-hosting back and forth in the studio and some of the others, but this is
[50:30.520 --> 50:32.000]  more intimate and this is what I like.
[50:32.000 --> 50:37.760]  So in the big studio, the new fancy studio that's been around three years, we'll have
[50:37.760 --> 50:41.640]  Owen Troyer and Kristi Lee with me next hour, but I'll be in the studio.
[50:41.640 --> 50:45.120]  They'll be in that studio right through the wall right there.
[50:45.120 --> 50:48.080]  And there won't be the echoes or the mics and all the technical problems that come with
[50:48.080 --> 50:50.560]  three guests on the same show and the rest of it.
[50:50.560 --> 50:54.240]  Anybody that doesn't understand that you see what the Democrats put on a debate with like
[50:54.240 --> 50:56.040]  five candidates that came to get that straight.
[50:56.040 --> 50:58.000]  So it becomes an issue.
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.680]  Okay.
[50:59.680 --> 51:05.440]  Let's talk about brass tacks here and let's talk about the reality of what we're facing.
[51:05.440 --> 51:12.920]  I saw a great tweet put out by Lore and legends on Twitter and it says in less than a week,
[51:12.920 --> 51:21.680]  female US president has let slip new world order troops to Ukraine, 82nd airborne, overthrow
[51:21.680 --> 51:31.600]  Putin, kill Putin, famine inbound, guaranteed to happen, oil shortages is what they want.
[51:31.600 --> 51:34.040]  Says it all, doesn't it?
[51:34.040 --> 51:39.120]  And then I saw this article in Rolling Stone and without even looking because I don't watch
[51:39.120 --> 51:45.720]  CNN, but it came up in my feed, CNN and others are all demonizing General Flynn, former head
[51:45.720 --> 51:50.880]  of defense intelligence, former national security advisor to Trump, great guy, salty earth.
[51:50.880 --> 51:52.480]  My spidey sense is always a hundred percent.
[51:52.480 --> 51:56.360]  It just says this guy's the best plus his actions are great.
[51:56.360 --> 52:01.200]  But he came out and decried this war and said it was bad on all sides, but pointed out why
[52:01.200 --> 52:04.960]  it happened, which is the reality.
[52:04.960 --> 52:11.440]  And then he said, I'll play the clip here in a moment that this is Bill Gates and George
[52:11.440 --> 52:15.840]  Soros's new world order in trouble and that the new world order is falling apart because
[52:15.840 --> 52:17.240]  of what Putin did.
[52:17.240 --> 52:25.920]  Now all these CNN, MSNBC, Rolling Stone, a bunch of them said, oh my God, he's a Russian
[52:25.920 --> 52:27.200]  agent arrest him.
[52:27.200 --> 52:33.000]  They literally said that he just said that Putin's fighting the new world order.
[52:33.000 --> 52:38.280]  Biden said it eight days ago.
[52:38.280 --> 52:44.200]  Biden said last weekend, like what last Friday, so eight days ago, seven days ago, whatever
[52:44.200 --> 52:50.000]  it is Friday before last, he said, we're a new world order and Russia's broken the new
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  world order.
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.160]  So now we've got to lead the new world order.
[52:53.160 --> 52:54.400]  And he admitted that.
[52:54.400 --> 52:58.720]  And then Flynn comes out and says, yeah, say what you want, but this invasion by Putin
[52:58.720 --> 53:08.120]  has really shook it up their new world order and they go, oh my God, you are such a commie.
[53:08.120 --> 53:12.760]  Michael Flynn says Putin's Ukraine invasion is disrupting Bill Gates's new world order.
[53:12.760 --> 53:16.160]  Someone like Vladimir Putin has upset the balance of the new world order and they're
[53:16.160 --> 53:18.200]  trying to achieve by going to Ukraine.
[53:18.200 --> 53:21.960]  The former national security advisor said that's completely true.
[53:21.960 --> 53:24.600]  That's not an endorsement of Putin.
[53:24.600 --> 53:25.880]  It's what happened.
[53:25.880 --> 53:31.840]  It's what hell Biden's been honest about that.
[53:31.840 --> 53:40.440]  But they think you're so stupid that he actually just tells you what's going on so he's bad.
[53:40.440 --> 53:43.440]  Here it is.
[53:43.440 --> 53:48.880]  Vladimir Putin has now upset this balance of the new world order that they were trying
[53:48.880 --> 53:51.680]  to achieve by going into Ukraine.
[53:51.680 --> 53:59.760]  And I'm probably the last person that's going to be a Putin apologist, I won't be, but what
[53:59.760 --> 54:05.560]  I do understand are the dynamics that are playing out in Ukraine right now.
[54:05.560 --> 54:10.200]  And I sent you something earlier, Clay, and we don't need to go into the details of it.
[54:10.200 --> 54:17.400]  But all of what we are seeing play out in Europe right now is an upsetting of the balance
[54:17.400 --> 54:19.640]  of the world order as they want it.
[54:19.640 --> 54:25.120]  As people like Dr. Harari, as people like Klaus Schwab and others, Bill Gates is another
[54:25.120 --> 54:26.120]  one.
[54:26.120 --> 54:31.520]  So we have to understand that these are people that are very smart, they're very well resourced,
[54:31.520 --> 54:38.120]  and they have a very sort of strategic idea of how they want to see the world develop.
[54:38.120 --> 54:50.360]  And God and a soul are not part of that strategy.
[54:50.360 --> 54:52.200]  And so they fund all the attacks on Flynn.
[54:52.200 --> 54:57.360]  I mean, this is a world government new world order, and what Putin is doing is messing
[54:57.360 --> 55:00.400]  that up, whether you're for Putin or not, that's what's happening.
[55:00.400 --> 55:05.600]  And Biden says, this is upending the new world order, and then Flynn goes, yeah, it's upending
[55:05.600 --> 55:06.600]  the new order.
[55:06.600 --> 55:10.640]  Hang on, you're a Russian agent.
[55:10.640 --> 55:13.680]  Because you're telling the truth, it's ridiculous.
[55:13.680 --> 55:18.640]  If there was footage of Russians executing prisoners and blowing their genitals off with
[55:18.640 --> 55:20.960]  handguns, we would say that's wrong.
[55:20.960 --> 55:24.200]  And I'm sure the Russians probably are doing some things that are wrong.
[55:24.200 --> 55:27.280]  It's like, you know, I'm not part of the Democratic Party.
[55:27.280 --> 55:28.960]  I'm not a Republican party minion.
[55:28.960 --> 55:29.960]  I'm not under Putin.
[55:29.960 --> 55:31.240]  I'm under George Soros.
[55:31.240 --> 55:34.760]  I'm trying to tell the truth and promote justice.
[55:34.760 --> 55:39.560]  And we're supposed to just join one side or the other in this.
[55:39.560 --> 55:41.480]  I'm in the Jesus Christ Party.
[55:41.480 --> 55:42.680]  I'm in the Christian Party.
[55:42.680 --> 55:44.120]  I'm in the survival party.
[55:44.120 --> 55:45.720]  I'm in the civilization party.
[55:45.720 --> 55:50.160]  I'm in the love party, folks, but that means I'll stand up strongly for what I believe
[55:50.160 --> 55:54.040]  in and defend my family in that process.
[55:54.040 --> 55:56.360]  The globalists are collapsing the world economy by design.
[55:56.360 --> 55:57.360]  They brag about it.
[55:57.360 --> 56:01.200]  They're using this as the pretext and the virus and the lockdowns.
[56:01.200 --> 56:02.200]  It's the great reset.
[56:02.200 --> 56:03.800]  And we've got to expose it.
[56:03.800 --> 56:05.960]  We're going to start the next hour.
[56:05.960 --> 56:07.400]  And boy, do we have a lot to cover.
[56:07.400 --> 56:11.720]  There's so many big stories we haven't even hit yet on the economy and on the Supreme
[56:11.720 --> 56:18.120]  Court nominee and on the war and on the pedophile rings and just the open parents locked out
[56:18.120 --> 56:22.800]  of middle schools and elementary schools while they teach children about sex acts.
[56:22.800 --> 56:27.560]  And it's in the news and there's a Texas investigation by the governor going on.
[56:27.560 --> 56:31.200]  I mean, you just even I can't believe it's gotten to this point and it's going to get
[56:31.200 --> 56:34.680]  a lot crazier separately.
[56:34.680 --> 56:36.760]  We can't stay on air without your support.

[57:22.320 --> 57:23.320]  website infowarstore.com.
[57:23.320 --> 57:34.520]  We're going to come back and continue to plow through all this news and more straight ahead.
[57:34.520 --> 57:35.520]  God bless them.
[57:35.520 --> 57:39.920]  They're going to break the chains.
[57:39.920 --> 57:49.080]  You can't stop them.
[57:49.080 --> 57:56.260]  They're going to break the chains.
[57:56.260 --> 58:12.560]  This is going to come in one piece so don't worry about it.
[58:12.560 --> 58:16.000]  super-ingredients behind brain force culture include
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.960]  Guarana-seep, which is loaded with energy compounds
[58:18.960 --> 58:21.080]  and antioxidants that have been used by
[58:21.080 --> 58:23.360]  Amazonian tribes for centuries.
[58:23.360 --> 58:26.520]  Alpha-GPC, a natural compound found in the brain

[58:48.880 --> 58:51.600]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[58:51.600 --> 58:53.480]  They're here all over the world,
[58:53.480 --> 58:55.320]  from Australia to the United States,
[58:55.320 --> 58:56.840]  from Canada to Germany.
[58:56.840 --> 58:59.000]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do
[58:59.000 --> 59:00.920]  everywhere you go, then coming to your house
[59:00.920 --> 59:02.360]  and threatening in some cases,
[59:02.360 --> 59:05.840]  actually taking people away into the night
[59:05.840 --> 59:07.240]  to their facilities.
[59:07.240 --> 59:08.880]  And they're planning in the next year
[59:08.880 --> 59:11.680]  to expand their shield process where they come
[59:11.680 --> 59:13.720]  and take, quote, healthy people away
[59:13.720 --> 59:15.840]  and put them in facilities for their safety.
[59:15.840 --> 59:17.600]  This is nothing less than martial law.

[59:19.480 --> 59:21.800]  is to get high quality Faraday cages,

[1:00:05.960 --> 1:00:10.400]  Pfizer seeks approval to inject infants.
[1:00:10.400 --> 1:00:11.520]  Big Brother.
[1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:13.360]  Mainstream media.

[1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:18.560]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:21.880]  Live from the Infowars.com Studios,
[1:00:21.880 --> 1:00:23.920]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:23.920 --> 1:00:25.880]  Pfizer seeks approval to inject infants
[1:00:25.880 --> 1:00:30.220]  with deadly gene therapy shots. We're going to play that club and come back with Owen
[1:00:30.220 --> 1:00:36.500]  Schreuer and Christy Lee in studio tonight. We have got so much to cover with these massive
[1:00:36.500 --> 1:00:41.180]  war crimes being commended against the Russians. And again, I'm not a russophile, folks. I'm
[1:00:41.180 --> 1:00:46.300]  a truth-of-all. And this is just unbelievable war crimes on tape and our corporate media
[1:00:46.300 --> 1:00:51.180]  is not covering it. But first, here's this report dealing with their system coming after
[1:00:51.180 --> 1:00:55.920]  our children are bio-weapon injection and we'll come right back. Because some human
[1:00:55.920 --> 1:01:02.880]  beings care about their children, VAERS was established in 1990, an early warning system
[1:01:02.880 --> 1:01:09.920]  to identify negative reactions and side effects of vaccination, which makes sense. But there
[1:01:09.920 --> 1:01:16.440]  are major problems. It is managed by the FDA and the CDC, which explains why the VAERS
[1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:22.400]  database requires a class to learn how to find anything. Taking the time to actually
[1:01:22.400 --> 1:01:28.960]  file a report is voluntary. And out of fear of losing their jobs or being considered an
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:36.040]  anti-vaxxer, nobody wants to speak ill of the all-holy vaccine, let alone make an official
[1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:43.720]  report. It is estimated that only 1% of vaccine injuries ever get reported to VAERS. So that
[1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:50.960]  means when VAERS reports over 44,000 adverse reactions and 90 deaths, one can expect it
[1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:58.840]  to be as much as 4.4 million adverse reactions and 9,000 deaths. And these numbers are only
[1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:06.120]  from the age 5 to 17 group. Conservative numbers put it at 10%, which is half a million children
[1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:12.440]  that have been wounded and killed from an unneeded, unwanted, experimental gene therapy
[1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:20.120]  shot that we rely to about every step of the way. Thanks to the open VAERS project, which
[1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:27.080]  is built upon the VAERS data, the public can easily search these reports and see for themselves.
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:33.520]  People are reporting adverse reactions such as chronic pain, loss of hearing and taste,
[1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:40.560]  talking gibberish and acting out aggressively. And these are the mild cases. There is a tsunami
[1:02:40.560 --> 1:02:48.320]  of major brain damage, heart disease, and fatalities. Edward Dowd has analyzed the data
[1:02:48.320 --> 1:02:55.400]  and has reported an 84% increase in deaths among ages 25 through 40, which is the same
[1:02:55.400 --> 1:03:02.920]  amount of lives lost to the Vietnam War. Toby Rogers estimates that Big Pharma kills twice
[1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:09.880]  as many people that died in World War II every single year. The press ignores this because
[1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:16.440]  it's not enough. They want your newborn babies as well. Pfizer is pushing to have children
[1:03:16.440 --> 1:03:21.760]  as young as six months old, given a shot that we know is potentially fatal, even though
[1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:27.720]  children were never at risk and are still not at risk. The United States has been force
[1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:34.160]  injecting infants and children with experimental vaccines for years. And now they want to add
[1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:39.800]  the infamous plot shot. Thanks to virtue signaling mothers, some children have already been
[1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:46.240]  getting it in the womb, which is resulting in miscarriages, stillbirths, and deaths from
[1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:52.920]  breastfeeding on toxic genetically modified mothers' milk. Pfizer is planning on submitting
[1:03:52.920 --> 1:04:00.600]  another application for emergency use authorization in early April. That's about 18 million children
[1:04:00.600 --> 1:04:07.320]  under five who could be sacrificed to the altar of Big Pharma and political correctness.
[1:04:07.320 --> 1:04:13.640]  If Pfizer can achieve permanent liability protection from the FDA, who they control,
[1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:19.280]  then they can add the mRNA gene therapy shot to the childhood vaccine schedule, where it
[1:04:19.280 --> 1:04:25.520]  will enjoy permanent liability protection under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine
[1:04:25.520 --> 1:04:31.320]  Injury Act. These same crooks are putting a judge on the Supreme Court who openly defends
[1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:38.320]  leniency towards crimes that involve child rape. They are coming for your children and
[1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:42.840]  they will not stop. If you still care about the human race and are looking for something
[1:04:42.840 --> 1:04:49.880]  you can do right now, you can go to Toby Rogers at Substack and read his urgent call to action
[1:04:49.880 --> 1:04:58.600]  for more info. Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:04.440]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games, I like going to concerts, I
[1:05:04.440 --> 1:05:09.720]  like going to play golf, I like going out to dinner. I like the metropolitan life. I
[1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:14.720]  like everything that comes with this. But see, I have the survival instinct that is
[1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:20.400]  to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas,
[1:05:20.400 --> 1:05:24.840]  because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down. Is it time to just move
[1:05:24.840 --> 1:05:28.720]  out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in the woods, just get off grid,
[1:05:28.720 --> 1:05:32.800]  just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the land? That's the survival instinct.
[1:05:32.800 --> 1:05:36.600]  But see, the worldly part of me, that's still probably the majority part of me, says no,
[1:05:36.600 --> 1:05:41.040]  no, no, no, no, stay in the city. The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere
[1:05:41.040 --> 1:05:45.680]  that would ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask. That's the internal struggle
[1:05:45.680 --> 1:05:51.520]  that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well. But you can at least have
[1:05:51.520 --> 1:05:55.760]  some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies. And so we have the best ones at
[1:05:55.760 --> 1:06:23.320]  M4store.com. The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[1:06:23.320 --> 1:06:29.000]  New Transmission, the great Owen Shroyer and Christy Lee are in the other studio with massive
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:34.880]  news coming up. They'll be co-hosting Women This Hour, and they'll be hosting the special
[1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:42.520]  broadcast we do that is Sunday Live, 6 to 8 p.m. Central, on the total sexualization
[1:06:42.520 --> 1:06:49.920]  and total pedophilic takeover of public schools across the country, including Austin, Texas,
[1:06:49.920 --> 1:06:54.840]  headline, Texas Attorney General says Austin School District is breaking state law after
[1:06:54.840 --> 1:07:01.160]  barring parents, this is Fox News, barring parents from Pride Week, where they teach
[1:07:01.160 --> 1:07:05.320]  the children how to have sex with each other and more. There's video of it. I mean, this
[1:07:05.320 --> 1:07:10.680]  is just next level. Forget, let gay marriage happen. Man, let us have your kids. This is
[1:07:10.680 --> 1:07:15.240]  unbelievable. I don't care if they're head of a sexual, homosexual, this is pedophilic.
[1:07:15.240 --> 1:07:18.840]  That is all coming up. They have exclusive footage of Christy Lee with the police coming
[1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:24.240]  after her for even showing being outside of the school on Friday and Thursday. That is
[1:07:24.240 --> 1:07:27.600]  coming up. They're going to be riding shotgun with us on all these other issues here in
[1:07:27.600 --> 1:07:37.240]  just a moment. But I want to get back to where we are. We have footage, just hours of it.
[1:07:37.240 --> 1:07:44.040]  It's on infowars.com. On Ukrainian websites and the Daily Mail and ABC News going, oh,
[1:07:44.040 --> 1:07:50.520]  the value of Ukrainians, they chop the testicles off the Russians when they capture them. Got
[1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:56.560]  the Daily Mail right here. How great it is, how wonderful it is. And then we actually
[1:07:56.560 --> 1:08:01.560]  see footage of it. I'm not going to show you the footage. I showed you shooting them
[1:08:01.560 --> 1:08:06.080]  in the testicles and shooting them, blowing their feet off and shooting their knees. But
[1:08:06.080 --> 1:08:12.080]  then we have the footage of them with their clothes off, with their genitals blown off,
[1:08:12.080 --> 1:08:18.720]  kicking them in the groin as they beg. This is just next level torture. But to the liberals,
[1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:24.320]  this is only as second best to killing a baby before it's born. I mean, this is high evil.
[1:08:24.320 --> 1:08:29.080]  This is super fun. This is what the Nazi battalions did in World War II. Now the grandchildren
[1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:33.120]  of those folks are doing it again. I'm not even going to forward what Russia did, but
[1:08:33.120 --> 1:08:38.200]  the West funded the overthrow of the government eight years ago, Soros bragged. And now they
[1:08:38.200 --> 1:08:42.760]  started a war with the ethnic Russian groups that are 50% of the population. And so the
[1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:48.640]  fight is going on. And Joe Biden is saying he wants nuclear war. Joe Biden is saying
[1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:53.360]  he wants to kill Putin. He says the US may first strike Russia. I mean, you talk about
[1:08:53.360 --> 1:09:00.360]  scary. I mean, you talk about an out of control lunatic with the nuclear codes on TV. This
[1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:04.560]  is just so surreal. I can't even believe what's happening every night I go to bed. I'm thinking
[1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:12.840]  we may have nuclear war while I'm sleeping. Wow. So we have all that going on. Let's play
[1:09:12.840 --> 1:09:17.720]  a clip just of them shooting. And there's hours of this. It's on enforce.com. I can
[1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:26.960]  play it all here for you. It's too graphic shooting the Russians that have been captured
[1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:49.600]  in the knees in the feet and in their genitals. Here's the footage. And it goes on and on
[1:09:49.600 --> 1:09:54.160]  from there. You can see the genitals all destroyed. Everything else. And I'm laughing when they
[1:09:54.160 --> 1:09:58.880]  go Rusky, Rusky and kick him in the groin. Ha, ha, ha, Rusky, Rusky. And then they say
[1:09:58.880 --> 1:10:02.560]  how Hitler and all the rest of their normal stuff. So of course, let's make sure it's
[1:10:02.560 --> 1:10:07.720]  our oceans ones. He's very proud. Just that's a little secret about it all who runs the Nazis.
[1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:11.920]  So here we are, ladies and gentlemen, I want to play a clip though before we, you know,
[1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:17.280]  I'll get the clip after we go to our special guest host here. But we have the head of the
[1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:22.720]  whole new world order Larry's fink. Black Rock saying some key things we'll cover at
[1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:28.720]  the bottom of the hour. But let's bring Owen Shroyer and of course his co-host tonight
[1:10:28.720 --> 1:10:36.160]  for Sunday Live onto the broadcast to tell us about exactly what is unfolding. So Owen
[1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:39.040]  Shroyer and Christy Lee, what is your view on all this?
[1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:45.320]  Well, you know, it's really hard to get down to the truth about anything that's going
[1:10:45.320 --> 1:10:49.600]  on in Ukraine. But the video that you played where it's the Russian soldiers getting tortured,
[1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:53.800]  I mean, that's what it is. That's been confirmed by so many news agencies that it's almost
[1:10:53.800 --> 1:10:58.160]  weird that they want us to see that and know that it's going on when there's so much other
[1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:02.760]  stuff going on with bombings and captures and Russian tanks and all this other stuff.
[1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:06.360]  And you're like, okay, well, where's the original source? Who's confirming it? You know, there's
[1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:10.520]  all these different languages. It's very confusing. But all of them confirmed and bragged like,
[1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:14.240]  yes, this is what we're doing to the Russians, Ukrainian news, everybody. Yes, look, we've
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:18.040]  got them. We've got the Russian dogs. And they confirmed this video. It's like we can't
[1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:22.320]  confirm anything else. Snake Island, Ghost of Kiev, all this other stuff, like, oh,
[1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:25.960]  we don't know, no, it's fake news. But then this, though, they brag about this, Alex,
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:30.120]  they want us all to know. Well, it's designed to make Putin escalated and start World War
[1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:34.520]  III, all of this. Well, that's what you get the feeling of. But I think it's becoming
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:40.040]  more and more clear by the day. The real agenda from the Biden administration is they want
[1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:44.320]  this to go on as long as possible. They want this to go on as long as this is the reelection
[1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:49.320]  bid. And it's the perfect scapegoat. Oh, high gas prices, inflation, all this other stuff.
[1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:53.160]  Russia is the perfect scapegoat that they can blame for all of that. Plus, if you take
[1:11:53.160 --> 1:11:59.040]  a look at the weapons manufacturers stocks, they've all gone up at least 25% in the last
[1:11:59.040 --> 1:12:05.240]  time COVID was for big pharma. Now defense gets its trillions. Well, well said, Chrissy
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:09.080]  Lee, what's your view on this? Well, it's just sick me to have to watch that. I mean,
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:13.040]  it's extremely violent. But like Owen said, it's interesting that they will show us that
[1:12:13.040 --> 1:12:17.640]  it's also interesting that we're constantly those of us that try and post things constantly
[1:12:17.640 --> 1:12:23.040]  get misleading or missing context for everything that we post. Meanwhile, Biden is posting
[1:12:23.040 --> 1:12:29.960]  on Facebook that Zelensky is a Jew. There's no Nazi element. Well, just because Zelensky
[1:12:29.960 --> 1:12:34.840]  is Jewish doesn't mean that there isn't a Nazi element. And so it's like he's trying
[1:12:34.840 --> 1:12:40.280]  to take that away from the fact that there's this this violence and that there is a Nazi
[1:12:40.280 --> 1:12:47.040]  element there. But there's no missing context or misleading back check attached to that,
[1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:50.840]  which obviously that is misleading. Just by pointing out that he's Jewish, that supposedly
[1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:55.720]  that there's there's not a Nazi element to root out. But beyond the Nazi element thing,
[1:12:55.720 --> 1:13:01.080]  the West started the war in Ukraine and did all this. That's not debatable. And the fact
[1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:05.560]  that the battle lines in World War Two were Nazi versus Russian. So of course, that's
[1:13:05.560 --> 1:13:10.320]  the last battle that was fought there. I'm just really concerned. We're a month plus
[1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:15.560]  into this now. How crazy this is going to get. Well, I think, you know, what's odd is
[1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:19.040]  Zelensky's come out and said, OK, we won't be a part of NATO, but that didn't seem to
[1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:23.440]  calm things down. I'm not really sure what Putin's full agenda here is. That's the one
[1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:26.560]  thing if you could say Putin hasn't been honest. He hasn't been honest about that. He said
[1:13:26.560 --> 1:13:30.480]  he wouldn't invade. He did. So I think he's kind of unpredictable, even from the globalist
[1:13:30.480 --> 1:13:35.160]  eye. Great. We don't know what Putin's real plan is. But that's actually what adds to
[1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:39.120]  the genius of it. I mean, the fact that Trump was such a good leader is because you never
[1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:44.400]  knew what he was doing. That's why people didn't go into war on his clock. And so in
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:50.280]  that same aspect, they're like, what is he doing? Will he do the any nuclear and they
[1:13:50.280 --> 1:13:54.720]  won't answer that question? So it's actually whereas Biden just is like, I'm going to do
[1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:59.960]  this and I'm going to do that. And so it's just the tactics of war, obviously, are not
[1:13:59.960 --> 1:14:05.040]  good on our side. They just want to push us into war ultimately. Yeah. And if you do believe
[1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:10.500]  Biden and his slip ups from his short trip to Europe, he said troops will be in Ukraine.
[1:14:10.500 --> 1:14:14.720]  So I guess that's him telling us within maybe before after midterms, they're going to send
[1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:18.800]  troops to be on the ground in Ukraine. Just another another war in a foreign country that
[1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:23.320]  our troops will have to die in will spill blood and treasure in and we'll get no benefit
[1:14:23.320 --> 1:14:27.640]  at all. I mean, is this is a backup plan? If they don't have a serious virus situation
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:31.640]  that they'll be like, oh, we can't vote right now where we can't where we have to have mail
[1:14:31.640 --> 1:14:35.280]  in balance again, because we're in the middle of World War three. I mean, is this just the
[1:14:35.280 --> 1:14:36.280]  backup plan?
[1:14:36.280 --> 1:14:43.240]  Christy, I totally agree with you. This new war is COVID 2.0. And that's really the big
[1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:47.600]  question we've got to be asking ourselves is how crazy is this going to get? And why
[1:14:47.600 --> 1:14:52.720]  is Biden saying, will new Russia kill Putin? And then his own secretary of state says,
[1:14:52.720 --> 1:14:57.440]  no, that's not what we're doing. It just shows it's all completely out of control. I
[1:14:57.440 --> 1:15:03.000]  want to play this clip when we come back. A Black Rock CEO Larry Fink says Russians
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:09.160]  Ukraine war is up ending world order. What does that really mean? Are they really claiming
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:14.520]  that globalism is in trouble? Or is this just globalism expanding its control? I'm going
[1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:19.400]  to do three more segments with our guest house and they're going to take over tonight from
[1:15:19.400 --> 1:15:26.800]  the other studio for Sunday Night Live. They've got so much to cover. And again, this is independent

[1:18:57.900 --> 1:19:03.940]  Our world is so full of hype. We are force-fed, dehumanizing, propaganda by the corporate
[1:19:03.940 --> 1:19:10.560]  media by the controlled churches and the universities. Why is this the case? Because we innately,
[1:19:10.560 --> 1:19:16.000]  by God, have been given the keys to our own minds, our own psyches, our own souls. And
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:22.920]  by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and transcend the quote, fallen or sinful state.
[1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:28.200]  So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to
[1:19:28.200 --> 1:19:33.360]  change who we are are only lowering us. They're only making us more depressed. In the end,
[1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:38.040]  they're only making us less filled. It is only by going within and really making that
[1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:42.520]  connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves. That's why the globalist, bombardist,
[1:19:42.520 --> 1:19:47.760]  toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements
[1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:53.240]  our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[1:19:53.240 --> 1:19:59.120]  And that's where the incredible products come in at FullWarsTour.com.
[1:19:59.120 --> 1:20:13.960]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:13.960 --> 1:20:20.960]  Powers of world government, powers of dehumanization want this broadcast silenced. Please never
[1:20:20.960 --> 1:20:28.560]  forget that. So BlackRock CEO with over 10 trillion in management, the guy that invented
[1:20:28.560 --> 1:20:37.560]  housing derivatives and massive frauds, he has come out ladies and gentlemen with a letter
[1:20:37.560 --> 1:20:45.000]  to their shareholders and said, world government is over. Globalism is over. It failed. Now
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:53.800]  everybody's going to starve and society is going to collapse. Go read the letter. He
[1:20:53.800 --> 1:21:01.200]  actually says it. You should read it for yourself and see it.
[1:21:01.200 --> 1:21:05.640]  Because globalism was always meant to collapse society and I told you they want to collapse
[1:21:05.640 --> 1:21:11.960]  the nation state and have everything implode, the third world pollode and then have a city
[1:21:11.960 --> 1:21:17.680]  state set up that's above the law and run by them. That's their plan to collapse civilization
[1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:24.840]  in a post-industrial world is the statement they've made. They got their acolytes and
[1:21:24.840 --> 1:21:29.920]  their menus to go along with all this corruption and censorship and secret arrest and wars
[1:21:29.920 --> 1:21:34.920]  and lies to build the utopia and now they go, oh my God, it all failed. The utopia is
[1:21:34.920 --> 1:21:44.760]  over. The utopia is over and now globalism has to fight the nationalist. He actually
[1:21:44.760 --> 1:21:49.880]  says that in a statement. They're the ones that caused the war. They're the extremists,
[1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:55.800]  not us. It's all been prescripted. Here's a clip of Laura Ingram talking about it Friday
[1:21:55.800 --> 1:21:56.800]  night.
[1:21:56.800 --> 1:22:02.480]  We've told you before about the great reset of capitalism that's being pushed by the
[1:22:02.480 --> 1:22:08.560]  elites at the World Economic Forum. Now among the most ardent resetters is BlackRock CEO
[1:22:08.560 --> 1:22:14.520]  Larry Fink. But in his annual shareholder letter today, Fink issued a warning to his
[1:22:14.520 --> 1:22:19.800]  Davos buddies saying the Russian invasion of Ukraine has put an end to the globalization
[1:22:19.800 --> 1:22:24.800]  we've experienced over the last three decades. Companies and governments will also be looking
[1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:30.520]  more broadly at their dependencies on other nations. Joining me now is Victor Davis Hansen,
[1:22:30.520 --> 1:22:37.160]  Hoover Institution senior fellow. Well, Victor, if there's a bright light and a devastating
[1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:44.320]  tragic, ongoing nightmare in Ukraine, it might be that people are generally beginning to
[1:22:44.320 --> 1:22:50.320]  wake up of the idea that it's time to decouple from these despotic regimes.
[1:22:50.320 --> 1:22:55.920]  Yeah. I think people understood from the League of Nations failure in the 30s that political
[1:22:55.920 --> 1:22:59.920]  globalism never worked. I mean, the United Nations condemned Russian's invasion, didn't
[1:22:59.920 --> 1:23:04.280]  do any good. The majority of the population in the world didn't sign on to sanctions.
[1:23:04.280 --> 1:23:09.160]  That's why Joe Biden has changed his tune. But what's fascinating, Laura, is this is
[1:23:09.160 --> 1:23:14.040]  economic globalization. This was supposed to make us all live in utopia. And here we
[1:23:14.040 --> 1:23:18.040]  have an architect of it, and he's saying, you know, two or three years ago, he would
[1:23:18.040 --> 1:23:22.760]  say, you know, capital chases labor and production costs anywhere in the world where they're
[1:23:22.760 --> 1:23:27.040]  the cheapest. And now he's saying, we can't do that. And I think he's saying that because
[1:23:27.040 --> 1:23:33.640]  the natural order of history is not calm. It's not peace. It's not cooperation. Unfortunately,
[1:23:33.640 --> 1:23:38.360]  and tragically, it's war. It's revolution. It's plague. And we learned that with COVID.
[1:23:38.360 --> 1:23:42.760]  And now you're playing. And so now everybody knows I'm not trying to make intellectual
[1:23:42.760 --> 1:23:50.120]  dunks on Laura Ingram or anybody, but that's pathetic. Oh, Larry think now what realizes
[1:23:50.120 --> 1:23:56.480]  his plan failed of love. And now he realizes it's all no, they sucked everybody dry. They
[1:23:56.480 --> 1:24:01.200]  sold everybody on this police state in the name of ending war. And then now they go,
[1:24:01.200 --> 1:24:07.000]  oh, my gosh, it all failed. Now we're going to have to, you know, do whatever. This is
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:13.600]  a really serious situation. Christy Lee, Owen Schreuer, what's your view on this statement
[1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:19.640]  by the most powerful globalist in the world, Larry Fink? Well, I think it's pretty clear
[1:24:19.640 --> 1:24:23.560]  they're just running a bait and switch or a shell game here to blame Putin or Russia
[1:24:23.560 --> 1:24:26.880]  for everything. It's the same thing that Biden is doing here in America. It's just
[1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:31.400]  the wait a minute. You mean gas prices aren't up because of hyper printing of currency?
[1:24:31.400 --> 1:24:36.200]  I mean, it's Putin's fault, right? Well, they brag all day how they're going to have this
[1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:40.760]  great reset and how you're going to have to pay for it. And now it's actually bearing
[1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:45.400]  fruits and you're seeing it and they've got the perfect invasion of Ukraine with Russia
[1:24:45.400 --> 1:24:49.320]  behind it to distract from it and say, oh, look, this is all Putin's fault. You're going
[1:24:49.320 --> 1:24:52.480]  to starve because of Putin. You're going to be poor because of Putin. You're going to
[1:24:52.480 --> 1:24:57.640]  eat the bugs because of Putin. And it was it was their plan all along. So again, I don't
[1:24:57.640 --> 1:25:01.520]  know if this is Putin even playing into their hands or falling into a trap or he's still
[1:25:01.520 --> 1:25:05.040]  acting organically or doing his own thing. But clearly that's what's going to happen
[1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:09.000]  here. And when you have Joe Biden letting it slip, letting the cat out of the bag, oh,
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:13.280]  expect food shortages, expect famine. He didn't say expect. He says it's going to happen.
[1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:17.160]  It's going to be bad. Yeah. So I mean, that's all this is to me is just it's just the bait
[1:25:17.160 --> 1:25:21.840]  and switch. It's a shell game. Perfect scapegoat for all the things the globalists are doing,
[1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:26.320]  all the things Biden is doing is Putin and Russia. And he just really doesn't even play
[1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:29.440]  ball with them at all. He comes out and makes a statement maybe once a week or every other
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:33.520]  week to just kind of give an update. But other than that, you really don't know what Putin
[1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:37.880]  is doing, what Putin is thinking, who what, you know, what warnings he's making on a on
[1:25:37.880 --> 1:25:43.040]  a daily basis. Russia continues to be the wild card that America should be. Christy Lee,
[1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:46.880]  what do you think's going on? Well, I'm like, of course, thoroughly tainted
[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:51.600]  by the mainstream news. So even with Fox News coming out with this and the Wall Street
[1:25:51.600 --> 1:25:55.720]  Journal talking about it, I'm just skeptical of every bit of it. If they say that, that
[1:25:55.720 --> 1:26:00.200]  oh, no, we're losing our plans of globalization, I feel like if they're putting that out there,
[1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:04.600]  that it's the opposite that they still have these plans, and they're still going to move
[1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:09.200]  forward and they're just kind of like trying to make it seem like that they're surrendering.
[1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:12.680]  So I'm just always skeptical. If that's the narrative that they're putting out, I'm always
[1:26:12.680 --> 1:26:16.160]  thinking it's something that's the opposite. No, I totally agree. I mean, what they're
[1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:20.880]  doing is, Oh, the collapse isn't the new old order. It's Putin. That's why your gas
[1:26:20.880 --> 1:26:25.120]  prices are up. That's why all this, what's, that's just the cherry on top. It's been
[1:26:25.120 --> 1:26:29.120]  the whole devaluation, their whole program, their lockdowns that did this. You're totally
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:34.320]  right, Christy. Yeah, I mean, and people are are waking up. That is the silver lining
[1:26:34.320 --> 1:26:38.960]  of all of this. I mean, everybody feels the pain of the pump. Everybody feels the prices
[1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:43.720]  at the grocery store. And I don't think people are buying it anymore that it's just Putin's
[1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:47.480]  fault. We were feeling this before this all happened. And now they're trying to reach
[1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:52.200]  back and continue to blame things that have nothing to do with it. And I agree. National
[1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:57.000]  polls show 25% of people blame Putin. They're blaming Biden and the globalist. You're right.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:02.320]  I mean, everybody knows it's, it's Biden's shut down the keystone pipeline, not Putin.
[1:27:02.320 --> 1:27:06.520]  And it's funny because Biden will say, this is just poor leadership. And he's referring
[1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:11.020]  to Putin, but it's just like, no, it's, yes, it is poor leadership, but it's your poor
[1:27:11.020 --> 1:27:15.560]  leadership. Exactly. I wish it was all Putin's fault. Sorry. Oh, and go ahead. But just notice
[1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:19.320]  what they always do in the Bush years. It was you're losing your freedoms because of radical
[1:27:19.320 --> 1:27:22.680]  Islamic terrorists. No, the government did that during the coronavirus years. It's you're
[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:26.380]  losing your freedom because of a virus. No government did that. Now during this Ukraine
[1:27:26.380 --> 1:27:29.400]  war, which will probably go on for years, who knows, maybe even decades, and they'll
[1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:33.160]  say, Oh, it's not your government. It's it's Putin doing that. It's the Ukraine war doing
[1:27:33.160 --> 1:27:37.560]  that. So it's the same story. Our government constantly destroying us, destroying our freedoms,
[1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:41.480]  destroying our country and then blaming somebody else. It's the typical game that they play
[1:27:41.480 --> 1:27:46.280]  with us. And the people are starting to wake up to it. But those that fall for the propaganda
[1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:49.840]  are more obvious than ever. Yeah, here's another stand with Ukraine March. I know there was
[1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:53.160]  a big one in Philadelphia today. They have them in Austin all the time. It looks like
[1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:58.360]  this with them as in DC. So it just shows how they can just get their masses, their
[1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:03.520]  brainwashed masses, even if it is a minority to go along with anything, get in the streets,
[1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:07.280]  and then they win the optical battle because they own all the news stations. So they just
[1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:11.800]  make it look like, Oh, everybody loves Ukraine. Everybody's scanning with Ukraine. And if you're
[1:28:11.800 --> 1:28:16.600]  paying more for gas and food for Ukraine, then that's okay. That's just fine. Again,
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:21.920]  if the Ukrainians really didn't want to be with Russia, I'd be all for it. But Soros
[1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:28.400]  brags, they went and started it and did it. It's ridiculous. This is just more of the
[1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:31.920]  let's blame Russia for everything. And that's why it's laughable at this point. And that's
[1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:36.800]  why people are waking up because they blamed Russia on literally everything. And we've
[1:28:36.800 --> 1:28:42.000]  seen every narrative. Oh, I slipped and fell Christy in the shower yesterday. I was a little
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:45.400]  banana peel right there. We're going to come back and talk about this and a lot more and
[1:28:45.400 --> 1:28:49.200]  where the economy is going and where you think where you guys think this is all going to
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:55.200]  unfold with Christy Lee and Owen Shroyer straight ahead. I'm Alan Shoy. Stay with us.
[1:28:55.200 --> 1:29:02.960]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist. I wanted to
[1:29:02.960 --> 1:29:08.240]  stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:13.120]  before they went operational, but we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're
[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:19.680]  not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:24.520]  great reset. And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[1:29:24.520 --> 1:29:28.640]  tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear
[1:29:28.640 --> 1:29:33.040]  the truth. So we've got an information warfare, the enemy and try to stop their agenda. We've
[1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:36.840]  also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high quality
[1:29:36.840 --> 1:29:42.560]  storeable food. We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.

[1:30:21.920 --> 1:30:28.280]  Transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world
[1:30:28.280 --> 1:30:34.200]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID
[1:30:34.200 --> 1:30:40.320]  hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[1:30:40.320 --> 1:30:45.480]  And none of it can succeed. None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[1:30:45.480 --> 1:30:50.880]  silenced and gas lit. And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and
[1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:55.480]  diligence. And that's why it's hard to share info wars links and ban video links. That's
[1:30:55.480 --> 1:31:00.120]  why we've got to share them now more than ever. The eugenicists over a hundred years
[1:31:00.120 --> 1:31:04.640]  ago were very public about their plans. They financed major universities. They ran full
[1:31:04.640 --> 1:31:09.960]  page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda of New York Times, other major
[1:31:09.960 --> 1:31:15.880]  newspapers, that the family as we know it is a bad thing and must be ended. And the first
[1:31:15.880 --> 1:31:21.440]  step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that cooking dinner and
[1:31:21.440 --> 1:31:25.760]  taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing. And I was just sitting
[1:31:25.760 --> 1:31:30.280]  here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national daughter, my wife makes dinner
[1:31:30.280 --> 1:31:34.480]  a lot of times. But I like to make it as well. I love to make breakfast. And literally it's
[1:31:34.480 --> 1:31:39.240]  the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurtured tips. And then
[1:31:39.240 --> 1:31:44.640]  all sit down together and have that communal event. And that's what the system is attacking
[1:31:44.640 --> 1:31:50.800]  and bombarding is our normal biological actions are coming together. They really are sick,
[1:31:50.800 --> 1:31:55.600]  evil scientific cult of filth and want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats that
[1:31:55.600 --> 1:31:57.960]  we cannot let this continue.

[1:32:59.520 --> 1:33:27.520]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:32.280]  Alex Jones back live. Christie Lee and Owen shroy writing shotgun was taken over in about
[1:33:32.280 --> 1:33:42.960]  27 minutes in the third and fourth hour tonight on just staggering sexualization and brainwashing
[1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:47.580]  and grooming of our children in Austin, Texas where we're based and exclusive footage that's
[1:33:47.580 --> 1:33:53.160]  all coming up. Christie's load of her bear. So is Owen, but guys getting back to the current
[1:33:53.160 --> 1:34:02.160]  state of the world and looking at what's happened in the US economy. We see Biden saying, oh
[1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:09.620]  food shortages will happen in America and sanctions on Russia are sanctions on America.
[1:34:09.620 --> 1:34:17.880]  But Russia's just selling its extra oil to China and India. It's not even hurting Russia.
[1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:23.280]  What's your views on this economic situation because it's just crazy to watch.
[1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:27.760]  Here's the big geopolitical picture that nobody wants to talk about and it's weird Alex to
[1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:33.440]  think that us here at info wars this this rag tag team of freedom loving free speech
[1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:37.560]  loving berserkers are the only people that understand this are at least willing to talk
[1:34:37.560 --> 1:34:44.720]  about it. The geopolitical forces of nature are changing rapidly right now and what you
[1:34:44.720 --> 1:34:54.080]  see is Saudi Arabia, UAE, probably Egypt and in time, Mexico, Brazil and Russia and China
[1:34:54.080 --> 1:35:00.840]  and India all starting to form this kind of anti globalist packed with one another doesn't
[1:35:00.840 --> 1:35:04.440]  mean they see eye to eye on everything but they know most of the world's corruption is
[1:35:04.440 --> 1:35:10.960]  coming out of the West. They know that it's the Western political empires that are running
[1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:15.920]  most of these operations. They know it's the globalist in control. Exactly. And look, they've
[1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:18.880]  got their own corrupt leaders and they've got their own stolen loot and they've got their
[1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:23.800]  own problems. They don't want to teach their kids how to suck cock. Okay, they don't want
[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:27.800]  to teach their kids how to be gay and use dildos and vibrators and everything else. I mean,
[1:35:27.800 --> 1:35:30.840]  that's just that's just one measurement of it. They also don't want to see that came
[1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:35.840]  out for JK Rowling and said she says men are men women are women she's banned. This really
[1:35:35.840 --> 1:35:40.320]  freaks people out around the world that your boy we're going to teach your boy he's a girl.
[1:35:40.320 --> 1:35:44.480]  That really is kind of a break the deal thing for people. Well, and look, I'm not trying
[1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:48.520]  to be graphic. We've got the stories Christy Lee covered this month ago where they show
[1:35:48.520 --> 1:35:54.080]  your kids pornographic material and teach young boys how to give blowjobs. I mean that
[1:35:54.080 --> 1:35:57.800]  took to other boys. So we're going to cover that coming up. You shouldn't teach boys girls
[1:35:57.800 --> 1:36:03.600]  anybody that Jesus. I mean, yeah, it's so disgusting and it that is one interesting thing. I know
[1:36:03.600 --> 1:36:07.760]  you've watched plenty of the Oliver Stone stuff, but we watched that whole thing where
[1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:12.160]  he's talking to Putin very long documentary is really fascinating to hear about what he
[1:36:12.160 --> 1:36:17.600]  thinks about these things. And particularly basically they don't let them talk about that
[1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:21.920]  thing to children, those kinds of subjects to kids period. Well exactly Christy and even
[1:36:21.920 --> 1:36:28.960]  even two weeks ago, Bill Mars said, I agree with the governor of Florida to Sanis. Why
[1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:34.560]  are you teaching six year olds how to do stuff that I mean, it's totally evil if a parent
[1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:38.720]  was teaching their six year old this, you'd arrest them. I mean, this is crazy. It is
[1:36:38.720 --> 1:36:43.840]  so crazy. And what I'm tending to see is that they've overplayed their hand. They pushed
[1:36:43.840 --> 1:36:48.760]  this to such a degree that it has caused many to wake up. But as far as the other subject
[1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:53.760]  with the Ukraine, it's interesting if you talk to actual Ukrainians or people that came
[1:36:53.760 --> 1:36:58.200]  here from Ukraine and just their perspective on things. I was talking to Angela for Indiana,
[1:36:58.200 --> 1:37:04.320]  a woman running for Congress there in Indiana, who came here as an immigrant from Ukraine
[1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:10.040]  and was born in Ukraine just to hear her actual perception on everything. And I was saying,
[1:37:10.040 --> 1:37:15.000]  so what is the truth, you know, because we're obviously getting major narratives from both
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:21.680]  sides propaganda from both sides. And she said, what I am seeing is that the only explanation
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:27.440]  for the leadership in America is that they are purposely trying to destroy America. She's
[1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:32.080]  like, there's no other explanation for it. And it's so sad that I came here at the young
[1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:36.920]  age of 20. And I lived the American dream. I'm a successful financial advisor. Now I'm
[1:37:36.920 --> 1:37:42.440]  running for Congress. And I have to now see the total destruction of America, the purposeful
[1:37:42.440 --> 1:37:45.160]  destruction of America at the hands of this current leadership.
[1:37:45.160 --> 1:37:49.240]  Well, I mean, that's really it. Not Russia is not perfect. We're not even saying that.
[1:37:49.240 --> 1:37:52.960]  But clearly when Putin says you're trying to take over and kill our families, that's
[1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:57.640]  what the left's doing. And that's what they're teaching in Ukraine. And then that's the reality
[1:37:57.640 --> 1:37:59.280]  here is they're coming for our children.
[1:37:59.280 --> 1:38:04.440]  Well, and I think if you look at the Gaddafi story, everything kind of builds out from
[1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:08.640]  here now. For so many years, there wasn't a political leader or country that wanted
[1:38:08.640 --> 1:38:12.280]  to stand up for the wet to the West for obvious reasons. I mean, look at Bill Clinton bombing
[1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:15.960]  Kosovo and all the countries that they would just bomb relentlessly, just to get headlines
[1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:21.360]  off of him getting blowjobs under the White House desk. Look at what we did during the
[1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:25.400]  Bush years. Look at what we did during the Obama years. So nobody wants to stand up to
[1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:28.540]  the West. Nobody wants to stand up to the globalist and fight for independent nation
[1:38:28.540 --> 1:38:32.640]  or they'll give you the Gaddafi. And everybody knows this. We have the emails from Hillary
[1:38:32.640 --> 1:38:36.960]  Clinton's staffers and the Democrat Party and the State Department.
[1:38:36.960 --> 1:38:41.600]  So now here comes Putin. And Putin is basically giving the double bird to the Western media,
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:45.000]  which is their their first line of defense. And then if they don't, if they don't take
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:49.280]  that, they move on to just bombing you. Well, now people are saying, hmm, Putin is standing
[1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:53.760]  up to the West. Russia is standing up to the West. Oh, okay. Maybe we can get on board
[1:38:53.760 --> 1:38:59.280]  with that. And so you see UAE, you see India, you see Mexico, you see Brazil, you see these
[1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:02.960]  other countries. So and again, the globalists actually stay in the game from that long term.
[1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:07.400]  And that's what's crazy about us. They just don't. I just see it like this. Some of the
[1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:12.040]  world leaders have signed on to the idea, maybe because they believe it, that we're
[1:39:12.040 --> 1:39:16.160]  a virus on this planet. It's like from the movie, the Kingsman. And so we have to be,
[1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:19.000]  we have to be killed. We have to be killed or the planet's going to die and we won't
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:23.440]  be able to live on this life raft and floating through space. Or they just they just don't
[1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:26.960]  care. They like the money and power for themselves, wipe humans off the earth. They really couldn't
[1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:31.000]  carry their way. But I don't think that's every leader on the planet. I don't think
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:35.480]  that's what Donald Trump represented either. So there's kind of this resistance forming
[1:39:35.480 --> 1:39:40.680]  to that mindset of the only way to save humanity is to kill humanity. And it all seems to be
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:47.200]  kind of forming geopolitically right now around Russia's resistance to the globalist in Ukraine.
[1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:53.040]  And if you look at a NATO map from 1998 to just this last year, you'll see it's NATO
[1:39:53.040 --> 1:39:57.480]  that's been expanding. It's Russia that has biological weapons labs that are the United
[1:39:57.480 --> 1:40:01.560]  States backed on their borders. And they've finally had enough with all the other stuff
[1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:06.720]  going on. And Putin decided I'm launching this religious holy war for Russia, which
[1:40:06.720 --> 1:40:10.600]  is how he sees it. He's aligned himself with the Christian movement in Russia. He's a he's
[1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:14.600]  a strong nationalist. And so he's decided this is his time. And he probably knows he's
[1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:17.960]  on a suicide mission. He probably knows that he's either going to get killed trying to do
[1:40:17.960 --> 1:40:23.320]  this to save Russia, or he's going to have a strong Russia stronger than it's been in
[1:40:23.320 --> 1:40:26.400]  a long time. And they're going to be a world leader.
[1:40:26.400 --> 1:40:27.880]  Christy, your views on that.
[1:40:27.880 --> 1:40:33.600]  Well, I mean, Russia is the one that's winning in this so far. I mean, with even the they're
[1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:38.160]  they're taking Bitcoin now, you know, their money is strengthening. Like you said, they're
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:43.720]  not hurting. They're just finding other buyers. So the sanctions only hurt us. So I mean, this
[1:40:43.720 --> 1:40:47.960]  I would think would only embolden him. So something's got to give, which obviously is
[1:40:47.960 --> 1:40:53.360]  scary because we we just feel so indefensible right now. I mean, gosh, we don't even care
[1:40:53.360 --> 1:41:00.160]  about our borders here. So it is very, it's scary as a mother to just be watching all
[1:41:00.160 --> 1:41:05.280]  this play out, have no confidence in our leadership and seeing the strengthening of other countries.
[1:41:05.280 --> 1:41:08.680]  I think that's right. All right, final segment straight ahead. I got a couple of important
[1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:13.040]  clubs I want to play. And then the next two hours, Christy Lee and Owen Schroer are going
[1:41:13.040 --> 1:41:18.480]  to host Sunday live, only six minutes of ads an hour for local stations, no network ads
[1:41:18.480 --> 1:41:23.960]  for us. Very, very important information coming up. Please don't forget listeners, we're just
[1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:27.000]  trying to tell the truth. We're trying to give you the best analysis we can not take
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:31.960]  inside just just siding with the truth. Thank you for your word of mouth. That's what overrides
[1:41:31.960 --> 1:41:37.680]  the sensors. And thank you for financial support at info or store.com. We've got a big sale
[1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:42.760]  going on right now on things like t shirts. A lot of the t shirts I designed, I made or
[1:41:42.760 --> 1:41:46.400]  the crew did, I never promoted them. So there's a huge stock pile of them like, why are we
[1:41:46.400 --> 1:41:51.760]  in the red? Well, you ordered 10,000 t shirts and you never promote them. I'm like, Oh my
[1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:58.800]  gosh, we got to get money now. They're literally at cost up to 75% off at info or store.com
[1:41:58.800 --> 1:42:04.440]  on t shirts. You'll see the big, you know, graphic up there that says mega super blowout
[1:42:04.440 --> 1:42:10.400]  sale. That's where you find it all. These are great t shirts. And they're printed America
[1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:14.520]  most, the most the closet even from America. Some are made in Mexico or wherever, but most
[1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:18.260]  of it's made America printed America. It's all printed America. It's all there in info
[1:42:18.260 --> 1:42:23.440]  or store.com or triple a two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. And we need the funds
[1:42:23.440 --> 1:42:27.000]  to stay on air. And I'm so exhausted and cross-eyed. Sometimes I'm like, God, I hope they don't
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:31.360]  support us. I'll just finally give up, but we can't give up. So please keep us in the
[1:42:31.360 --> 1:42:36.320]  fight. Thank you for being the info war viewers and listeners and those that support us. You
[1:42:36.320 --> 1:42:41.960]  are the info war and you are the tip of the spear in this fight and you outrage the globalist
[1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:46.560]  and you make them so angry that we're still on air. So thank you for keeping us on air.
[1:42:46.560 --> 1:42:52.040]  You are the resistance. Viewers like you keep us on air info war store.com. We'll be right
[1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:57.600]  back.
[1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:03.640]  Our world is so full of height. Your force fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate
[1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:10.200]  media, by the controlled churches and universities. Why is this the case? Because we innately
[1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:15.720]  by God have been given the keys to our own minds, our own psyche, our own souls. And
[1:43:15.720 --> 1:43:21.760]  by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and trend, send the quote, fallen or sinful
[1:43:21.760 --> 1:43:26.560]  state. So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things that we try to bring into our
[1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:32.360]  bodies to change who we are are only lowering us. They're only making us for the present.
[1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:37.640]  In the end, they're only making us less fulfilled. It is only by going within and really making
[1:43:37.640 --> 1:43:42.440]  that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves. That's why the globalist, bombardist,
[1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:47.440]  toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements
[1:43:47.440 --> 1:43:53.120]  our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.

[1:44:57.680 --> 1:45:05.120]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:11.240]  until the populations rebelled. They would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:17.440]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives. But because
[1:45:17.440 --> 1:45:23.840]  of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers,
[1:45:23.840 --> 1:45:30.440]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government
[1:45:30.440 --> 1:45:35.960]  corporate takeover. And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever. The problem
[1:45:35.960 --> 1:45:40.520]  is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover. Like Canada,
[1:45:40.520 --> 1:45:46.720]  where they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other areas
[1:45:46.720 --> 1:45:51.360]  of the world are following suit like Australia. So pray for these folks big time. It's a very
[1:45:51.360 --> 1:45:57.200]  serious situation and stay tuned into infowarstore.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[1:45:57.200 --> 1:46:03.760]  It has been noted by many a historian. The first casualty of war is the truth. Then the
[1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:10.960]  next big casualty isn't even the people that die. No, that invariably follows. But first
[1:46:10.960 --> 1:46:18.760]  there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and massive censorship.
[1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:24.400]  And now across the world, from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:33.080]  that if you amplify any quote pro Russian information, you can be censored, you can
[1:46:33.080 --> 1:46:38.440]  be arrested, you can be imprisoned. And of course now Canada's introduced legislation
[1:46:38.440 --> 1:46:44.560]  that if you have a thought crime, and they think you may have the intent to engage in
[1:46:44.560 --> 1:46:50.280]  hate speech online, that you will be censored and arrested. Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism
[1:46:50.280 --> 1:46:55.560]  is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes infowarstore.com
[1:46:55.560 --> 1:47:15.720]  more important than ever.
[1:47:15.720 --> 1:47:33.280]  And
[1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:35.400]  They hope you don't tell folks about the broadcast.
[1:47:35.400 --> 1:47:36.880]  They hope you don't tune in.
[1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:39.840]  But here's old Larry Fink,
[1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:42.280]  the head of the really $20 trillion,
[1:47:42.280 --> 1:47:44.580]  they say $10 trillion, but they've leveraged it,
[1:47:44.580 --> 1:47:46.180]  program who invented,
[1:47:47.900 --> 1:47:50.560]  who invented derivatives,
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:55.560]  who invented the mortgage-backed derivative in the 80s.
[1:47:56.960 --> 1:47:58.920]  He's just a front man of all this, but look at him.
[1:47:58.920 --> 1:48:00.860]  He's so confident.
[1:48:00.860 --> 1:48:05.660]  He sees you as something he's gonna prey on.
[1:48:05.660 --> 1:48:07.300]  He runs all the leftist movements,
[1:48:07.300 --> 1:48:09.160]  the devaluation, the open borders.
[1:48:09.160 --> 1:48:10.000]  Look him up.
[1:48:11.100 --> 1:48:13.060]  He says, oh, the new world order failed.
[1:48:13.060 --> 1:48:14.060]  Everything's gonna collapse.
[1:48:14.060 --> 1:48:15.220]  We're all gonna be poor now.
[1:48:15.220 --> 1:48:16.740]  That was always their plan.
[1:48:16.740 --> 1:48:17.860]  They've already stolen the wealth.
[1:48:17.860 --> 1:48:19.620]  Now they want you to think nation states,
[1:48:19.620 --> 1:48:22.560]  individual people caused this calamity.
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:23.740]  We are now entering.
[1:48:25.780 --> 1:48:27.340]  And then I see these headlines
[1:48:27.340 --> 1:48:32.180]  where you've got the Supreme Court nominee
[1:48:32.180 --> 1:48:35.540]  defending sex offenders and child rapists.
[1:48:35.540 --> 1:48:37.620]  And then you wonder why all this is happening
[1:48:37.620 --> 1:48:40.220]  because it's about getting us to go along
[1:48:40.220 --> 1:48:42.140]  with anything they want.
[1:48:43.660 --> 1:48:45.620]  Always believe a woman, they told us.
[1:48:46.940 --> 1:48:49.900]  And they told us, no, we don't even know what a woman is.
[1:48:51.100 --> 1:48:54.920]  That's where we are in this world today.
[1:48:54.920 --> 1:48:58.880]  So, Christy Lee, oh, Troyer, give us a prelude
[1:48:58.880 --> 1:49:01.800]  of what's coming up in the third and fourth hour tonight.
[1:49:01.800 --> 1:49:03.600]  Well, we were actually just discussing
[1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:07.560]  where we were gonna go first out of the opening segment
[1:49:07.560 --> 1:49:09.200]  here coming up on Sunday Night Live.
[1:49:09.200 --> 1:49:13.680]  And quite frankly, my angle is we're gonna show all this stuff.
[1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:15.880]  We're gonna show all the gay pride for kids marches.
[1:49:15.880 --> 1:49:19.120]  We're gonna show how, and Christy just confirmed this
[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:21.120]  because she's doing her own independent research too,
[1:49:21.120 --> 1:49:23.920]  how now when you're being taught
[1:49:23.920 --> 1:49:26.160]  grammar and English in schools,
[1:49:26.160 --> 1:49:28.360]  they have a whole new system with the they, them,
[1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:32.320]  transgender pronouns, which are just so out of control
[1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:33.160]  at this point.
[1:49:33.160 --> 1:49:34.480]  I don't even know how you could learn anything.
[1:49:34.480 --> 1:49:37.360]  Total takeover to biology, language, everything.
[1:49:37.360 --> 1:49:39.680]  Literal sexualization of your children.
[1:49:39.680 --> 1:49:42.600]  You gotta hand it to them, this is so diabolical.
[1:49:42.600 --> 1:49:44.480]  Yeah, and I mean, if you were doing this in a playground
[1:49:44.480 --> 1:49:46.640]  or like I had like a summer camp for kids
[1:49:46.640 --> 1:49:48.360]  and I was doing this, I'd get sued, I'd go to jail,
[1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:50.160]  I'd be a predator because that's what it is.
[1:49:50.160 --> 1:49:52.560]  And in fact, we have the actual psychological warnings
[1:49:52.560 --> 1:49:54.480]  for what predatory behavior is
[1:49:54.480 --> 1:49:56.160]  and they match it every single way.
[1:49:56.160 --> 1:49:57.760]  So we're gonna show you everything they're doing.
[1:49:57.760 --> 1:49:59.560]  We're gonna show you the pornographic material
[1:49:59.560 --> 1:50:01.040]  that they show to kids and then say,
[1:50:01.040 --> 1:50:02.840]  oh, it's not pornographic, it's educational,
[1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:05.400]  teaching your sons how to go into the bathroom
[1:50:05.400 --> 1:50:07.640]  and suck each other's male members.
[1:50:07.640 --> 1:50:09.120]  Not even kidding you, that's what they say
[1:50:09.120 --> 1:50:09.960]  they say it's educational.
[1:50:09.960 --> 1:50:10.800]  I put you on a school now, man.
[1:50:10.800 --> 1:50:12.360]  I mean, the left is just unbelievable.
[1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:14.800]  They say it's educational, so it's not pornographic,
[1:50:14.800 --> 1:50:18.120]  but if I showed it on TV, I'd get an FCC warning.
[1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:19.760]  But so we're gonna show all this stuff.
[1:50:19.760 --> 1:50:21.760]  And a literal bunch of dudes dresses women
[1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:25.440]  dancing with our children and oh my God.
[1:50:25.440 --> 1:50:27.720]  Yeah, it just goes on, but it's literally
[1:50:27.720 --> 1:50:30.320]  a bunch of perverts being accessed to our children.
[1:50:30.320 --> 1:50:31.160]  And that's what they want.
[1:50:31.160 --> 1:50:32.880]  You see, man, they walk right up to the kids,
[1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:34.160]  they grab their little heads
[1:50:34.160 --> 1:50:36.040]  and they start to grind on them and everything.
[1:50:36.040 --> 1:50:37.360]  Oh, it's all an act of dominance.
[1:50:37.360 --> 1:50:38.960]  Look at these headlines, Fox News.
[1:50:38.960 --> 1:50:41.480]  Texas Attorney General says Austin School Board
[1:50:41.480 --> 1:50:45.880]  and district is breaking state law
[1:50:45.880 --> 1:50:48.440]  after barring parents from Pride Week.
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:51.240]  They locked them out while they celebrated it
[1:50:51.240 --> 1:50:53.880]  and brainwashed them and psychologically raped them.
[1:50:53.880 --> 1:50:56.960]  Austin Elementary School holds pride parade
[1:50:56.960 --> 1:50:59.560]  instruct students not to reveal what is said
[1:50:59.560 --> 1:51:00.680]  in community circles.
[1:51:00.680 --> 1:51:02.040]  We have the documents.
[1:51:02.040 --> 1:51:03.960]  I mean, this is pure pedophilia.
[1:51:03.960 --> 1:51:07.560]  A week long indoctrination of your students, your children.
[1:51:07.560 --> 1:51:10.760]  School district breaks state law with Pride Week events.
[1:51:10.760 --> 1:51:13.680]  Texas AG says, and then we show the actual training.
[1:51:13.680 --> 1:51:15.680]  I mean, oh my God.
[1:51:15.680 --> 1:51:17.480]  So yeah, and then I'm gonna also show how
[1:51:17.480 --> 1:51:18.920]  this is not isolated incidents,
[1:51:18.920 --> 1:51:21.400]  but it's going on in every state right now.
[1:51:21.400 --> 1:51:22.240]  And then-
[1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:24.680]  Oh yeah, it's just like Bradley Storytime is in Germany.
[1:51:24.680 --> 1:51:26.880]  It's in the UK, it's in Canada, it's in the US.
[1:51:26.880 --> 1:51:29.840]  It's all funded by BlackRock and other big banks.
[1:51:29.840 --> 1:51:31.840]  Christy Lee, what's coming up?
[1:51:31.840 --> 1:51:33.640]  Well, I'm gonna go on record and say
[1:51:33.640 --> 1:51:36.600]  I'm kind of sick, honestly, of Ken Paxton's lip service
[1:51:36.600 --> 1:51:39.640]  and Abbott, like they have always said a lot of good things
[1:51:39.640 --> 1:51:40.800]  but they need to do more.
[1:51:40.800 --> 1:51:43.320]  It's pretty sad when I feel like I'm a one woman show
[1:51:43.320 --> 1:51:45.320]  trying to fight against my own school district
[1:51:45.320 --> 1:51:47.120]  just outside of Austin ISD
[1:51:47.120 --> 1:51:49.240]  and then showing up to Austin ISD.
[1:51:49.240 --> 1:51:51.320]  And I'm the one that's kicked off.
[1:51:51.320 --> 1:51:52.440]  I'm the one that's pushed away.
[1:51:52.440 --> 1:51:56.120]  I spent, you guys all saw a whole day trying to show
[1:51:56.120 --> 1:51:58.000]  what they're teaching in school.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:02.520]  I had the books, some of the offices I was showing them to
[1:52:02.520 --> 1:52:04.960]  were horrified, but then when push came to shove
[1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:06.960]  and it went up the chain, went up the chain,
[1:52:06.960 --> 1:52:09.520]  the officers like, yeah, I still can't take your police report
[1:52:09.520 --> 1:52:14.520]  because I talked to the district attorney of Texas
[1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:16.920]  or I went up the chain and he said,
[1:52:16.920 --> 1:52:17.920]  we can't do anything about it
[1:52:17.920 --> 1:52:19.520]  because it's an education setting.
[1:52:19.520 --> 1:52:21.920]  So I'm like, so pornography is okay
[1:52:21.920 --> 1:52:23.560]  as long as it's in the schools.
[1:52:23.560 --> 1:52:24.720]  Okay, that makes sense.
[1:52:24.720 --> 1:52:26.280]  So I mean, I need more help.
[1:52:26.280 --> 1:52:27.880]  I need more parents to get involved.
[1:52:27.880 --> 1:52:30.360]  I need more of you all to pay attention
[1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:31.200]  to what's happening in school.
[1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:32.880]  That's right, in this latest footage of you last week
[1:52:32.880 --> 1:52:36.520]  being kicked off just the sidewalk out there by police.
[1:52:36.520 --> 1:52:39.160]  How dare you expose that they're locking children in.
[1:52:39.160 --> 1:52:41.920]  And the fact of the matter is, as I was reflecting,
[1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:42.760]  you know, always thinking,
[1:52:42.760 --> 1:52:43.840]  what could I've done differently?
[1:52:43.840 --> 1:52:44.880]  What could I've done better?
[1:52:44.880 --> 1:52:47.160]  You know, I realized in reflection,
[1:52:47.160 --> 1:52:50.240]  they didn't ever even tell me to go away
[1:52:50.240 --> 1:52:52.400]  or to get off the school administrators.
[1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:53.240]  None of them.
[1:52:53.240 --> 1:52:55.240]  Their resort was to call police.
[1:52:55.240 --> 1:52:56.640]  They never asked me to leave.
[1:52:56.640 --> 1:52:58.760]  They just straight up went and called the police
[1:52:58.760 --> 1:53:01.120]  and they sure enough roll up in five cop cars
[1:53:01.120 --> 1:53:02.600]  for one journalist.
[1:53:02.600 --> 1:53:04.520]  And again, this is going on all over the country
[1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:06.720]  with a particular elementary school you went to.
[1:53:06.720 --> 1:53:09.360]  Give people that headline in the name of the school.
[1:53:09.360 --> 1:53:12.920]  DOS Elementary is an Austin ISD school
[1:53:12.920 --> 1:53:16.440]  and I was there very far away from the kids
[1:53:16.440 --> 1:53:18.840]  just talking about what they're teaching
[1:53:18.840 --> 1:53:21.840]  and they just right away call the cops
[1:53:21.840 --> 1:53:24.160]  and try and make, it's all about intimidation.
[1:53:24.160 --> 1:53:27.160]  They locked the parents out.
[1:53:27.160 --> 1:53:28.880]  Packs to the attorney general states
[1:53:28.880 --> 1:53:32.600]  that students must obtain written consent
[1:53:32.600 --> 1:53:34.720]  from their parents before the school delivers
[1:53:34.720 --> 1:53:37.880]  human sexuality instruction according to state law.
[1:53:37.880 --> 1:53:39.960]  I mean, this is pure pedophilia.
[1:53:39.960 --> 1:53:42.840]  The pedophiles have figured out a bureaucratic way to do it.
[1:53:42.840 --> 1:53:46.080]  This is happening literal miles from our studio right now.
[1:53:46.080 --> 1:53:49.800]  Here's a clip of Christy Lee just a few days ago in Austin.
[1:53:50.920 --> 1:53:51.760]  Christy Lee here.
[1:53:51.760 --> 1:53:55.160]  I'm outside of DOS Elementary in Austin ISD school.
[1:53:55.160 --> 1:53:59.000]  We have just been ticketed for being on the property
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:01.400]  and told not to come back for an entire year
[1:54:01.400 --> 1:54:03.040]  or we will be arrested.
[1:54:03.040 --> 1:54:06.400]  All of this for wanting viewers to know
[1:54:06.400 --> 1:54:08.840]  what they're indoctrinating the children with
[1:54:08.840 --> 1:54:10.880]  here at DOS Elementary.
[1:54:10.880 --> 1:54:13.200]  Now DOS Elementary's been mighty proud
[1:54:13.200 --> 1:54:14.920]  of what they have going on this week.
[1:54:14.920 --> 1:54:16.000]  They're Pride Week.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:19.720]  They have had videos and pictures of the students
[1:54:19.720 --> 1:54:22.720]  celebrating a whole week dedicated
[1:54:22.720 --> 1:54:25.120]  to teaching children as young as four
[1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:29.080]  about gender ideology and, you know, acceptance.
[1:54:29.080 --> 1:54:31.320]  But, you know, they need to know about binary,
[1:54:31.320 --> 1:54:34.360]  non-binary, you can be a boy, girl or creature,
[1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:37.320]  you know, anything when it comes to Pride Week
[1:54:37.320 --> 1:54:38.960]  here at DOS Elementary.
[1:54:38.960 --> 1:54:40.680]  Now they did get some backlash for this.
[1:54:40.680 --> 1:54:43.800]  Especially because documents obtained
[1:54:43.800 --> 1:54:46.160]  and showed that the teacher's instructions
[1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:49.240]  were to tell the kids what is said in this classroom
[1:54:49.240 --> 1:54:51.560]  stays in this classroom.
[1:54:51.560 --> 1:54:55.040]  And remember that what is shared in the Pride circle
[1:54:55.040 --> 1:54:56.520]  is confidential.
[1:54:56.520 --> 1:54:59.080]  Well, obviously some parents had issue with this
[1:54:59.080 --> 1:55:01.960]  and brought the attention of the matter.
[1:55:01.960 --> 1:55:05.000]  And because of that, they did update the documents
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:08.720]  to say, teachers, make sure that you remind the children
[1:55:08.720 --> 1:55:12.400]  that they're allowed to share this information
[1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:13.240]  with the parents.
[1:55:13.240 --> 1:55:14.640]  How good of them, right?
[1:55:14.640 --> 1:55:16.800]  To be allowed to share with the parents.
[1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:18.800]  But if you want to see the whole report.
[1:55:18.800 --> 1:55:20.280]  All right, guys, we're going to stop right there.
[1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:21.320]  And, you know, we're a live show.
[1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:22.720]  It's just part of the course.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:27.200]  You know, I asked people days ago when I came here,
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:29.200]  I said, can we have the Christie League clip
[1:55:29.200 --> 1:55:31.120]  where they, we're gonna come back to you, Chris, okay?
[1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:32.600]  Just we're gonna come back next hour.
[1:55:32.600 --> 1:55:33.880]  Just everything's okay.
[1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:36.960]  I asked for the clip where the police throw you off, okay?
[1:55:36.960 --> 1:55:38.720]  That's the clip I want.
[1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:40.400]  And so I'm gonna host the next hour.
[1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:43.400]  I'm gonna come back, but I wanna hold, we're doing it, okay?
[1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:45.360]  Everybody gets me longer now.
[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:49.480]  Because, you know, that's just the way this is.
[1:55:49.480 --> 1:55:51.000]  Man, I've financed this.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.160]  You guys have financed this.
[1:55:53.160 --> 1:55:58.160]  And it's just like, it's just insane to me how screwed this is
[1:55:59.320 --> 1:56:01.400]  and what everything is done here, you know?
[1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:04.160]  Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
[1:56:04.160 --> 1:56:07.000]  We're gonna run rebroadcast, we get that clip,
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:09.280]  we're gonna start the next hour,
[1:56:09.280 --> 1:56:10.280]  and we're gonna get this out to people.
[1:56:10.280 --> 1:56:11.920]  We're gonna show the police.
[1:56:11.920 --> 1:56:12.880]  Hell, I can pull it up.
[1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:14.000]  Jesus, it's on my phone.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:17.080]  I mean, we're gonna get it, we're gonna do it, okay?
[1:56:18.080 --> 1:56:21.480]  It was the last thing I do on Earth.
[1:56:23.400 --> 1:56:24.960]  We're gonna get the right clip on the thing.
[1:56:24.960 --> 1:56:26.080]  Hell, I'll show you the clip.
[1:56:26.080 --> 1:56:27.160]  I mean, it's on her channel.
[1:56:27.160 --> 1:56:34.160]  I mean, you know, it's at Band-Aid video.
[1:56:39.120 --> 1:56:41.720]  So, we're gonna go to break.
[1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:42.560]  We're gonna start the next hour,
[1:56:42.560 --> 1:56:45.600]  I'll introduce the guest, we'll get the clip.
[1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:47.720]  And this is important information that these terrorists,
[1:56:47.720 --> 1:56:50.920]  these globalists, these perverts, these pedophiles,
[1:56:50.920 --> 1:56:54.080]  do not want you to see, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:55.680]  they do not want you to see this information,
[1:56:55.680 --> 1:57:00.680]  but we're going to air this information straight ahead,
[1:57:01.080 --> 1:57:02.560]  or I'm gonna shut Info Wars down.
[1:57:02.560 --> 1:57:05.920]  In fact, maybe it's just time, you know, seriously,
[1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:07.960]  like, everybody just wants this.
[1:57:07.960 --> 1:57:09.400]  Everybody just needs this.
[1:57:09.400 --> 1:57:13.640]  They just, it's just an absolute imperative
[1:57:13.640 --> 1:57:15.280]  that this type of thing go on.
[1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:19.680]  So, we're gonna start Info Wars coming up.
[1:57:19.680 --> 1:57:21.680]  We're gonna start Sunday Live with Christie Lee,
[1:57:21.680 --> 1:57:23.760]  and I'll destroy her for you straight ahead,
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:26.320]  because the whole point of them doing these next two hours
[1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:27.320]  was this, you know?
[1:57:32.200 --> 1:57:34.000]  Man, I tell you, unbelievable.
[1:57:35.080 --> 1:57:36.320]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen,

[1:57:47.360 --> 1:57:49.960]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it,
[1:57:49.960 --> 1:57:53.560]  it's just true, that Info Wars is seen by the globalists
[1:57:53.560 --> 1:57:56.200]  as the standard of human liberty,
[1:57:56.200 --> 1:58:00.960]  as the logo of human populist resistance
[1:58:00.960 --> 1:58:04.480]  against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[1:58:04.480 --> 1:58:07.880]  And man, our work is really right now
