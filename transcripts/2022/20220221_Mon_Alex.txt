[00:00.000 --> 00:15.680]  We're monitoring. We've learned from previous protests and demonstrations. We're monitoring
[00:15.680 --> 00:20.000]  the coverage. One of the tactics that the protesters and demonstrators are using is
[00:20.000 --> 00:26.440]  misinformation, information that is inaccurate, information that misleads the public. We're
[00:26.440 --> 00:34.320]  actively tweeting and providing information out through social media and other media mechanisms.
[00:34.320 --> 00:39.960]  The next step on the New World Order agenda is being normalized by Trudeau's unprecedented
[00:39.960 --> 00:47.920]  power grab. Canadians expect debate. Debate in service of all Canadians. Debate that
[00:47.920 --> 00:56.120]  is grounded in a shared acceptance of the facts. The federal government has invoked the
[00:56.120 --> 01:03.800]  Emergencies Act to supplement provincial and territorial capacity to address the blockades
[01:03.800 --> 01:12.280]  and occupations. I want to be very clear. The scope of these measures will be time limited.
[01:12.280 --> 01:20.360]  Now, some of those tools we will be putting forward measures to put those tools permanently
[01:20.360 --> 01:28.920]  in place. The scope of these measures will be time limited, geographically targeted as
[01:28.920 --> 01:35.760]  well as reasonable and proportionate. The Prime Minister and the Emergency Preparedness
[01:35.760 --> 01:42.640]  Minister have repeatedly stated that foreign extremist financing is behind Canadian protests.
[01:42.640 --> 01:48.000]  At Public Safety Committee last week, Deputy Director of Intelligence for FinTrack Barry
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.960]  McKillop stated that there is no evidence to back up these claims. In fact, he stated,
[01:53.960 --> 02:01.080]  quote, there has not been a spike in suspicious transactions related to the protest, end quote.
[02:01.080 --> 02:06.960]  Very soon, the graduates of tyranny will follow suit, creating an environment ripe for false
[02:06.960 --> 02:12.160]  flag order out of chaos. If you are involved in this protest, we will actively look to
[02:12.160 --> 02:18.600]  identify you and follow up with financial sanctions and criminal charges. Absolutely.
[02:18.600 --> 02:23.960]  This investigation will go on for months to come. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
[02:23.960 --> 02:29.520]  won't be able to stop himself from breaking up families and destroying their pets. A government
[02:29.520 --> 02:34.320]  that will kill your dog for simply disobeying their orders on a public demonstration will
[02:34.320 --> 02:40.040]  eventually have no issue killing you for the same. Trudeau is a fool and a tyrant.
[02:40.040 --> 02:46.760]  As Biden's January 6th gulag playbook will be repeated over the coming months, violence
[02:46.760 --> 02:52.880]  has no place in our societies and extremists will not succeed in overruling the will of
[02:52.880 --> 02:58.920]  the people. As Canadians, I think we've been all reflecting on our own country. Something
[02:58.920 --> 03:06.400]  I spoke with the premiers about last night. About the fact that democracy is not automatic.
[03:06.400 --> 03:13.280]  It takes work every day. About what a real accomplishment it is to maintain a political
[03:13.280 --> 03:19.520]  system in which the losing side gracefully concedes and in which rival political parties
[03:19.520 --> 03:27.920]  between elections work together for the common good. We have this in Canada because Canadians
[03:27.920 --> 03:37.760]  make it possible. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We are only allowing
[03:37.760 --> 03:42.760]  people that are presidents or have a purpose to be in this area through. That's what I'm
[03:42.760 --> 03:47.800]  being told, yes. Okay, so this is essentially, is this essentially a check point? You walk
[03:47.800 --> 03:53.120]  down, that's true. I'm being told not to talk to you guys anymore. We must always work to
[03:53.120 --> 03:59.280]  secure our democracy and not give comfort to those who promote things that are not true
[03:59.280 --> 04:05.280]  or give space for hatred or extremism. Canadians are to trust their government. Their government
[04:05.280 --> 04:11.760]  needs to trust Canadians. Those are the words of the prime minister in 2015. These people,
[04:11.760 --> 04:18.480]  very often misogynistic, racist, women haters, science deniers, the fringe. Same prime minister
[04:18.480 --> 04:24.400]  six years later as he fans the flames of an unjustified national emergency. Conservative
[04:24.400 --> 04:29.480]  party members can stand with people who wave swastikas. They can stand with people who
[04:29.480 --> 04:36.960]  wave. We choose to stand with Canadians who deserve to be able to get to their jobs. The
[04:36.960 --> 04:43.120]  dictatorial pandemic has only just begun. Trudeau knows that he can rule at the discretion
[04:43.120 --> 04:49.560]  of the monarchy with no term limit in sight. But section two of the Canadian Charter of
[04:49.560 --> 05:00.760]  Rights and Freedom will eventually catch up to it. John Bowne reporting.
[05:00.760 --> 05:05.880]  I've been on air more than 25 years. And long before I started selling high quality
[05:05.880 --> 05:13.800]  vitamin D3 eight years ago, I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[05:13.800 --> 05:18.720]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're black or white or Hispanic,
[05:18.720 --> 05:23.720]  it doesn't matter. Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that
[05:23.720 --> 05:27.720]  are out there. It's just like you need oxygen. You die in four minutes without oxygen. You
[05:27.720 --> 05:32.440]  die in five or six days without water. You die in a month without food. Well, that's
[05:32.440 --> 05:37.960]  because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that you need. And
[05:37.960 --> 05:41.440]  one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin
[05:41.440 --> 05:47.040]  D3. We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's
[05:47.040 --> 05:54.760]  defenses available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com. Everybody, old, young, black,
[05:54.760 --> 05:59.280]  white, you need vitamin D3. This is the best quality out there and it funds the info war,
[05:59.280 --> 06:06.280]  20% off.
[06:29.280 --> 06:49.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, what a time to be alive. What a time to be here talking directly to
[06:49.640 --> 06:54.480]  millions of you in defiance of the globalist and everything they've done to try to silence
[06:54.480 --> 07:00.680]  our pro-human movement that unifies the entire planet. And through free will, hopefully,
[07:00.680 --> 07:14.000]  with Christ finally. Russia has already been in an eight year proxy war with the globalist
[07:14.000 --> 07:20.920]  and the West began to move heavy weapons in in the last few years. They accelerated under
[07:20.920 --> 07:26.160]  Biden. And so Putin has put a bunch of troops on the border saying you need to not have
[07:26.160 --> 07:33.200]  them enter NATO. You need to stop heavy weapons shipments. We need to have a major armistice
[07:33.200 --> 07:41.220]  demilitarization ceasefire meeting under their Dnesk, if I pronounce that right, compact
[07:41.220 --> 07:47.720]  of several years ago. In response to that, NATO and the West began to pump in even more
[07:47.720 --> 07:55.640]  weapons anti-tank anti-aircraft where a two man missile team can take out several tanks
[07:55.640 --> 08:05.240]  by themselves. And so Putin pulled back troops a few days ago and said you've used give us
[08:05.240 --> 08:12.360]  a deal. We will not invade. And the response by Ukraine was to begin heavier attacks in
[08:12.360 --> 08:17.360]  eastern Ukraine on the Russian border. Both sides are shooting at each other. Both sides
[08:17.360 --> 08:22.520]  are killing each other. And I don't take aside of the, quote, Ukrainians or the Russians
[08:22.520 --> 08:27.560]  or any of this because when you pull back, you could argue both sides have issues with
[08:27.560 --> 08:33.240]  each other. But it's Russia's backyard. And the globalists that are doing this are the
[08:33.240 --> 08:39.000]  ones that started it and the ones that overthrew the elected Ukrainian government eight years
[08:39.000 --> 08:45.360]  ago. And it's been NATO that's been expanding. But nevertheless, here we are. And we have
[08:45.360 --> 08:48.640]  a headline that's going live here in just a few minutes that I was writing right before
[08:48.640 --> 08:57.040]  we went on air eight minutes ago that they're adding a few videos and other links to. The
[08:57.040 --> 09:06.200]  great Ben Warren is adding to it. And then we are going to go over all of it. But here's
[09:06.200 --> 09:13.320]  the headline. The world is now in World War Four. And it's a global corporate war against
[09:13.320 --> 09:19.120]  humanity designed to have a controlled implosion of society to then carry out their in game
[09:19.120 --> 09:25.280]  or their destination, their goal, 80 to 90 percent depopulation of the earth. Their official
[09:25.280 --> 09:30.640]  documents say 80 to 90 percent going back to the sixties. And these are the groups that
[09:30.640 --> 09:35.920]  created the Bilderberg group, the CFR, the trial lateral commission. It's all the same
[09:35.920 --> 09:40.880]  group. They're the capture elite capture groups, the corporate capture groups that you know
[09:40.880 --> 09:47.920]  of is the Davos group. The Davos group is the main PR mouth of this. He's a Lord of
[09:47.920 --> 09:56.640]  the Rings analogy. They're about to have the big battle there on the edge of Mordor. And
[09:56.640 --> 10:02.000]  the forces, the good guys are there and the big black gate opens and out marches a undead
[10:02.000 --> 10:09.240]  general. And they say, are you sore on? He says, no, I am the mouth of soren. And that's
[10:09.240 --> 10:19.760]  what Klaus Schwab is, is the mouth of soren. And above him is one of the top ringwraiths,
[10:19.760 --> 10:29.360]  Larry Fink. And then above that, of course, is the devil. And you could watch hundreds
[10:29.360 --> 10:35.560]  of hours. We play a lot of the clips of Larry Fink and Klaus Schwab and all their minions
[10:35.560 --> 10:43.480]  on television at conferences, sitting around arrogantly in their $10,000 suits, wearing
[10:43.480 --> 10:50.960]  their $100,000 rich watches, flying in on their $50 million private jets, telling you
[10:50.960 --> 10:54.600]  that they're going to discredit governments worldwide and collapse them with their corporate
[10:54.600 --> 11:03.080]  takeover plan to give you everything free and deliver you to a utopia. Later in the
[11:03.080 --> 11:07.400]  broadcast, I've got a bunch of clips together, some I got to yesterday, more I even got last
[11:07.400 --> 11:11.400]  night this morning, because I'd seen most of these clips over the years, but now Twitter
[11:11.400 --> 11:16.880]  and Instagram and everywhere is on fire with it. So friends, family are sending it to me.
[11:16.880 --> 11:21.520]  Cousins are sending it to me. They aren't even political. It's incredible, the awakening
[11:21.520 --> 11:26.840]  curve that's happening right now. And of course, Joe Rogan is now talking about great reset
[11:26.840 --> 11:32.520]  and great detail. It's a wonderful thing. So it's Tucker Carlson and so many others.
[11:32.520 --> 11:37.680]  And that's thanks to all of you getting the word out and making it safer for other people
[11:37.680 --> 11:43.520]  to now be able to get into it because it's become more mainstream. And so it's a big
[11:43.520 --> 11:48.740]  moment for all of us here because here's the bottom line, as I say, every show. I could
[11:48.740 --> 11:53.000]  have way more, quote, entertaining broadcast and cover more interesting topics and things
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.960]  that at the end of the day don't really matter, but are very interesting. Or I can just hammer
[11:58.960 --> 12:04.040]  that if we don't identify who's running World War Four or why I call it World War Four and
[12:04.040 --> 12:07.720]  who they are and what their goals are, we don't have any hope. But if we just identify
[12:07.720 --> 12:11.520]  these monsters, they will get the blame for everything they're doing and they will go
[12:11.520 --> 12:16.600]  to prison. They will stop. They will end up like Bernie Madoff and the rest of his family
[12:16.600 --> 12:20.800]  because it's the exact same type of ilk. They've just built bigger Ponzi schemes and
[12:20.800 --> 12:26.600]  hope worldwide martial law and germaphobia will allow them to get greater control out
[12:26.600 --> 12:36.760]  of them, steering humanity into a firestorm. So again, ladies and gentlemen, we are in
[12:36.760 --> 12:42.520]  World War Four right now. The CIA, and I think they're accurate when they say this, called
[12:42.520 --> 12:48.840]  the Cold War World War Three. A proxy war, millions died in the proxy wars. It was a
[12:48.840 --> 12:59.200]  long, cold war that would hybridize into Connecticut war, into kinetic war from time to time.
[12:59.200 --> 13:05.040]  But now we're going into World War Four that is economic, that is psychological, that
[13:05.040 --> 13:13.720]  is cyber, that is radiological, that is electromagnetic, that is chemical, that is covert, silent
[13:13.720 --> 13:23.840]  weapons, silent weapons for quiet wars, silent weapons for quiet wars. So just look these
[13:23.840 --> 13:29.240]  terms up and it's what the globalists are obsessed with and they brag how you're done
[13:29.240 --> 13:33.020]  animals and they brag how they're going to annihilate you and how they're going to slowly
[13:33.020 --> 13:37.960]  take all your resources but make you love it while they brainwash you using Pavlovian
[13:37.960 --> 13:46.560]  behavioral psychology. These are the worst villains the earth has ever seen. And they're
[13:46.560 --> 13:53.440]  in game before they carry out their final solution of forced depopulation is a digital
[13:53.440 --> 13:58.920]  ID that you must have to buy and sell. And that's why one of the board members of Klaus
[13:58.920 --> 14:03.600]  Schwab's organization, the Davos group that is the public arm of the Bilderberg group,
[14:03.600 --> 14:10.240]  literally he's the former editor of the Bilderberg group, states that oh now the system to track
[14:10.240 --> 14:15.160]  what you buy and what you do in live time is permanent and then she lists a UN Klaus
[14:15.160 --> 14:23.160]  Schwab program. So just a week ago the emergency in Canada is only for a few weeks. Now it's
[14:23.160 --> 14:29.920]  permanent and now from China to Germany to the US, Biden and the other globalists are
[14:29.920 --> 14:34.720]  announcing oh we're going to watch everything you do in live time on your computer or on
[14:34.720 --> 14:38.240]  your bank account or with your credit cards. And we're going to give it to third party
[14:38.240 --> 14:43.760]  intelligence groups. She says that to the press and to NGOs, the Southern Prairie Law
[14:43.760 --> 14:50.680]  Center, the ADL, Hope Not Hate, all these designate groups that go and train the police
[14:50.680 --> 14:55.320]  and train the colleges and political correctness. They're now not just spying on your Twitter
[14:55.320 --> 15:03.760]  or your Facebook account, they're now in your bank. Total criminal takeover, the ADL admits
[15:03.760 --> 15:08.720]  that they have supercomputers spying on what all Americans post and stay in live time and
[15:08.720 --> 15:15.640]  building databases. And that's it, it's very, very simple. You have an authoritarian fascistic
[15:15.640 --> 15:21.800]  corporate system, Larry Fink, merged with the communist Chinese, no one even debates
[15:21.800 --> 15:26.760]  that, helping run the biggest death camps in history. And he sits up there and lectures
[15:26.760 --> 15:31.160]  you about Black Lives Matter and how America's bad. And running BlackRock, he controls the
[15:31.160 --> 15:36.240]  Bilderberg group. And he sits up there and perches with several members in the video
[15:36.240 --> 15:41.280]  of Trudeau's cabinet talking about how they're going to destroy all the governments in the
[15:41.280 --> 15:45.400]  world and take them over and put us all on a universal basic income and control every
[15:45.400 --> 15:50.960]  facet of our lives, including our children's sexuality. These people are the definition
[15:50.960 --> 15:59.640]  of satanic, the definition of evil, the definition of our enemies.
[15:59.640 --> 16:04.760]  I've been on air more than 25 years. And long before I started selling high quality
[16:04.760 --> 16:11.640]  vitamin D three eight years ago, I've been promoting people taking vitamin D three because

[18:34.920 --> 18:39.920]  Alpha GPC, a natural compound found in the brain that delivers an essential nutrient

[19:01.640 --> 19:06.080]  started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds. I was overweight. I had
[19:06.080 --> 19:10.880]  brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding onto a job and I heard Dr.
[19:10.880 --> 19:14.680]  Group on your show and I listened to it. So the first one I got was the original survival
[19:14.680 --> 19:18.640]  shield, the X1 and it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter, you came out
[19:18.640 --> 19:21.960]  with that. You had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited
[19:21.960 --> 19:27.360]  about that. So I took it and man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like
[19:27.360 --> 19:32.720]  my brain was enlightened. You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[19:32.720 --> 19:37.160]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[19:37.160 --> 19:41.560]  take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one
[19:41.560 --> 19:46.280]  I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing.
[19:46.280 --> 19:50.640]  It works. But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free
[19:50.640 --> 19:54.520]  of the globalist system. And the only way to do that is to take our own health into
[19:54.520 --> 20:01.240]  our own hands. Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[20:01.240 --> 20:06.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:06.960 --> 20:22.560]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you what's coming up today. We're also going
[20:22.560 --> 20:26.360]  to have open phones in the second and third hour. And then Joe Salente takes over ahead
[20:26.360 --> 20:30.480]  of the war room at 3 p.m. Central. This is the Alex Jones show that you're tuned in
[20:30.480 --> 20:34.920]  to right now. Again, thank you so much for joining us. If you're a new listener, especially
[20:34.920 --> 20:39.160]  please research and check out the claims we make and find out it's true for yourself
[20:39.160 --> 20:42.960]  so that you understand you've been lied to by the establishment. And once you know that
[20:42.960 --> 20:47.080]  we're telling you the truth, we hope you'll take matters into your own hands peacefully
[20:47.080 --> 20:52.240]  and share the articles and videos and live feeds from this transmission and other transmissions
[20:52.240 --> 20:57.240]  that are telling the truth. All right, everybody's really freaking out
[20:57.240 --> 21:01.520]  about California, but it's happening all over the U.S., including Texas. It's happening
[21:01.520 --> 21:09.960]  here in Austin. This hasn't broke yet, but we have the documents where they pay elementary
[21:09.960 --> 21:17.160]  school students, middle school students and high school students to go have sex education
[21:17.160 --> 21:26.440]  and government-run dormitories and cabins where adults sleep with them, including biological
[21:26.440 --> 21:35.600]  males with little girls. And California is now defending this. We're going to be getting
[21:35.600 --> 21:39.640]  to all of it coming up. Marjorie Taylor Green was in the studio with us last night. She
[21:39.640 --> 21:46.840]  talked about it. We filed a report that's now live with the local newscasts out of California
[21:46.840 --> 21:55.280]  and MTG on infowars.com and band.video, breaking MTG response to biological men sleeping with
[21:55.280 --> 22:01.140]  elementary school girls at state-sponsored camp. But they say it's okay because they
[22:01.140 --> 22:06.680]  call themselves transgender, just like it's okay for men to go to female prisons and
[22:06.680 --> 22:13.920]  get women pregnant, and they say two women had a baby. That's coming up. Last segment
[22:13.920 --> 22:19.280]  of this hour. I'm going to tie it all together on what it's really all about and where it's
[22:19.280 --> 22:23.800]  all going because now it's official. These people are taking over sports. They're taking
[22:23.800 --> 22:34.440]  over the schools. They're taking over every single facet of life in the world, and they
[22:34.440 --> 22:41.920]  are capturing our children literally. Then, of course, we have massive martial law news
[22:41.920 --> 22:47.080]  around the world under the COVID tyranny and the latest on COVID-19, where the CDC just
[22:47.080 --> 22:52.000]  admitted, because they know it's coming out in federal court filings, that they knew the
[22:52.000 --> 22:58.840]  vaccine didn't work, but, quote, didn't want to tell the public because they didn't want
[22:58.840 --> 23:07.200]  us to know it didn't work. And because, quote, they didn't want to cause vaccine hesitancy
[23:07.200 --> 23:12.480]  or something that doesn't work. It's like selling somebody a canoe with a big hole in
[23:12.480 --> 23:15.360]  it and saying, well, I don't want to tell them it's got a hole in it. I'll put a sticker
[23:15.360 --> 23:20.040]  over it, and when they get out in the water, they're going to sink. It just shows the criminal
[23:20.040 --> 23:23.480]  activity here that they know it's all coming out, so now they want to cover their ass.
[23:23.480 --> 23:28.240]  Oh, and the British government's now saying, we knew lockdowns didn't work and cause massive
[23:28.240 --> 23:36.360]  death and suicide. We're sorry. It's the same thing over and over again. So we're going
[23:36.360 --> 23:40.360]  to be breaking all that down just over the top. I mean, ladies and gentlemen, we probably
[23:40.360 --> 23:47.040]  not exaggerating. We've got 20 clips of police beating women and men and putting them in
[23:47.040 --> 23:53.200]  the hospital who get out of their truck, put their hands up peacefully, and then the police
[23:53.200 --> 23:57.000]  literally break their ribs by jumping up and down on them and stomping them, and hitting
[23:57.000 --> 24:05.360]  them with rifle butts as hard as they can. And arresting old people and dragging everyone
[24:05.360 --> 24:12.280]  away and just unbelievable criminal activity right out of North Korea. That's all coming
[24:12.280 --> 24:19.680]  up. And then I've seen now some Davos group clips that I've never seen, and I thought
[24:19.680 --> 24:27.600]  I'd seen them all. Now, the public human intelligence is going out and digging through the global
[24:27.600 --> 24:31.880]  of statements and organizations. It's even worse than I thought. I mean, they're just
[24:31.880 --> 24:35.720]  up there making criminal admissions that boggle the mind. So in between your calls in the
[24:35.720 --> 24:39.440]  second and third hour, every segment will play a few clips and maybe get through the
[24:39.440 --> 24:46.160]  40 or so because I got 20 plus. I didn't get to yesterday out of 30 and I got 20 plus today.
[24:46.160 --> 24:51.480]  Each one more insane than the last in their words. And then members of parliament and
[24:51.480 --> 24:57.600]  others trying to talk about it and having their mics cut off. And the speaker of the
[24:57.600 --> 25:04.280]  parliament has a operative stuff and say that's not allowed disinformation. So see, it's not
[25:04.280 --> 25:09.480]  just live time censorship on Google and Twitter and Facebook and Trump's ban and all this
[25:09.480 --> 25:14.400]  stuff. Now it's everything. Oh, and speaking of that got contacted by the nice folks over
[25:14.400 --> 25:19.120]  at Chris social last week and they asked me to go sign up gave me a VIP access and I got
[25:19.120 --> 25:22.880]  busy and didn't do it. I'm trying to sign up during the breaks right now. I'm not the
[25:22.880 --> 25:29.520]  most technical person because it's like a beta test deal. You gotta go through this portal.
[25:29.520 --> 25:34.440]  But that's big news. And so we're going to be posting on there. Hopefully today Trump
[25:34.440 --> 25:40.040]  launches social media network. And they didn't they're not censoring us and stuff. So that's
[25:40.040 --> 25:43.640]  that's good. Of course, the left going to post a bunch of trash and say it's censored.
[25:43.640 --> 25:47.680]  You can't post porn. You can't have calls to criminal action. That's the normal internet
[25:47.680 --> 25:51.680]  rules that made sense previous to five, six years ago. So basically this just takes you
[25:51.680 --> 25:56.400]  back in a time machine, five, six years. I've seen friends and others that have it now.
[25:56.400 --> 26:01.320]  Others that are talk show hosts have shown to me that visited. And it works pretty good.
[26:01.320 --> 26:06.280]  It's looks about what like the internet looked like five years ago, which is fine with me.
[26:06.280 --> 26:10.360]  You know, just go back to when there was some basic freedom on it. And it works about like
[26:10.360 --> 26:16.160]  that too. So and I'm sure they'll work some of the bugs out and glad to see that having
[26:16.160 --> 26:24.160]  a successful launch so far. Now, here's something I'm just going to say. There's a lot of personal
[26:24.160 --> 26:27.960]  stuff that's been happening in full force behind the scenes that you don't know about.
[26:27.960 --> 26:33.840]  And I've meant for about a month to just come on air and tell you about all of it. And it's
[26:33.840 --> 26:39.840]  not that I'm even embarrassed about all this stuff. It's more like it's just so complex
[26:39.840 --> 26:44.760]  and there's so much of it. And it's so crazy that every time I get ready to talk about
[26:44.760 --> 26:55.800]  new stuff has happened. And it's just unbelievable. And it's what's coming for you and your family
[26:55.800 --> 26:59.680]  under the dictatorship of Black Rock and the Bilderberg group and the Davos group of the
[26:59.680 --> 27:09.440]  New World Order. But there has to come a time when you just spell out the facts to people.
[27:09.440 --> 27:16.880]  And we don't have extra money. We don't have extra assets to speak of. And we don't have
[27:16.880 --> 27:23.000]  the hundreds of millions of dollars that the Democratic Party law firms say we do. And
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.520]  they know that. The judges ordered everything to be given to them as a roadmap to destroy
[27:27.520 --> 27:30.760]  us. And even when they found out we don't have anything, they're like, well, we don't
[27:30.760 --> 27:35.280]  care. We want to just silence you and shut you down. Now, this operation could be shut
[27:35.280 --> 27:40.400]  down very soon. We'll be able to pop back up, do my show, all of it. I won't be able
[27:40.400 --> 27:44.600]  to personally have as much money. I don't care about it. In fact, it's good to have
[27:44.600 --> 27:49.880]  less stuff. I've told you I've got a trailer in the beautiful woods and I'm moving into
[27:49.880 --> 27:59.600]  the trailer. And I don't even own the trailer. So all this crap means nothing to me. But
[27:59.600 --> 28:04.960]  staying in the fight does and trying to keep all this great crew together does. But I
[28:04.960 --> 28:07.880]  just want you to know this country and the world's in a lot of trouble. And I think you
[28:07.880 --> 28:12.240]  know now I've not been exaggerating all these years. We're in really bad trouble. And we're
[28:12.240 --> 28:16.600]  a symbol of America and your speech and freedom and we are under attack. So I'd ask you all
[28:16.600 --> 28:20.880]  to pray for him full wars. And I'd ask you to financially support us because as much
[28:20.880 --> 28:26.600]  funds as we can get in and bolster what we're doing, then we can have something for our
[28:26.600 --> 28:33.320]  defense and something to prolong as long as possible. Us being on air in this permutation
[28:33.320 --> 28:37.480]  before we launch all the other things that are out there that other people have built
[28:37.480 --> 28:43.160]  and other people own that way they can't shut that down. So I'll literally be like the warrior
[28:43.160 --> 28:47.840]  priest that like Obi-Wan Kenobi has nothing but has a giant platform and reaches more
[28:47.840 --> 28:54.480]  people than ever. These people thought I'd back down over money. You have done nothing
[28:54.480 --> 29:04.960]  but energize me to the next level to life changing life empowering products are now

[30:06.720 --> 30:12.040]  thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for info wars store.com. Before I set out
[30:12.040 --> 30:17.560]  on a run I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going. You know
[30:17.560 --> 30:22.880]  besides the energy turbo force it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep
[30:22.880 --> 30:28.040]  me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy giving
[30:28.040 --> 30:32.280]  me the best chance at getting through the training and then every day now I'm taking
[30:32.280 --> 30:38.440]  Dr. Jones solar less. I have bad joints. Thanks mom. So this is great for giving my joints
[30:38.440 --> 30:43.680]  the extra support they need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[30:43.680 --> 30:48.280]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training. Even
[30:48.280 --> 30:53.320]  if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon good news turbo force that can still give
[30:53.320 --> 30:57.600]  you the energy and clarity you need for every day and solar less can keep you moving and
[30:57.600 --> 31:03.240]  feeling great at any age. Anything of real quality anything of lasting durability anything
[31:03.240 --> 31:09.880]  that's really satisfying and empowering and fulfilling it's going to be hard to attain
[31:09.880 --> 31:15.640]  and when it comes to information boys that's true today we see the entire global corrupt
[31:15.640 --> 31:22.080]  into a human depopulation great recent combine trying to collapse our society to build on
[31:22.080 --> 31:28.960]  its ashes their their transhumanist nightmare vision suppressing the voices of good people
[31:28.960 --> 31:35.120]  all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives
[31:35.120 --> 31:40.960]  their covid hysteria their world's gonna end in 2030 carbon tax global warming bull all
[31:40.960 --> 31:47.120]  of it and none of it can succeed none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody
[31:47.120 --> 31:52.560]  is silenced and gas lit and that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and
[31:52.560 --> 31:56.240]  with diligence and that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and band up with
[31:56.240 --> 32:01.280]  the elix that's why we've got to share them now more than ever it's time to protect your

[33:58.880 --> 34:14.640]  motion a plan for world domination and complete enslavement of humanity they can read the
[34:14.640 --> 34:22.800]  sub headlines they can sort of see them of mega corporations working through the world
[34:22.800 --> 34:28.520]  economic forum have initiated a controlled demolition of the world economy only by being
[34:28.520 --> 34:35.240]  aware of the plan the great reset can we stop their in game of the destruction of 90% of

[34:44.560 --> 34:49.200]  and important and that's what it comes down to ladies and gentlemen i wrote that quickly
[34:49.200 --> 34:54.920]  before i went live on air we probably just add a plan set in motion the plan the plan
[34:54.920 --> 35:04.000]  a plan it's their plan set in motion their plan and folks are gonna find out real fast
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.680]  that we're not joking around about any of this i understand people 25 years ago heard
[35:08.680 --> 35:15.120]  me talk about it but you know i was called all this by senior fbi agents senior pentagon
[35:15.120 --> 35:21.720]  generals senior people that have worked at the cia all senior people told me this when
[35:21.720 --> 35:26.080]  i was very young and then when i was got it politically involved and that's just the way
[35:26.080 --> 35:31.680]  the world works folks you can go read the books written by these people and there's been a
[35:31.680 --> 35:38.120]  massive resistance in america and in europe and in england but also in other areas against
[35:38.120 --> 35:43.720]  this big global takeover this elite capture claus Schwab didn't invent going and taking
[35:43.720 --> 35:48.320]  over and buying off politicians and leaders are running people for office who are in a
[35:48.320 --> 35:56.560]  cult but through the builder group and other organizations he set up one of the most successful
[35:56.560 --> 36:05.440]  launches in the 70s was the beta test the official launch in 1991 of a builder group
[36:05.440 --> 36:11.160]  trilateral commission cfr royal institute of international affairs roundtable groups
[36:11.160 --> 36:16.240]  is what cecil roads called them 120 years ago the guy that created the modern british
[36:16.240 --> 36:20.640]  empire you might want to read his books i have pretty powerful stuff it's all written
[36:20.640 --> 36:33.600]  there it's all there and the problem was in the 50 60 70s 80s and 90s there were mainly
[36:33.600 --> 36:39.440]  military officers and former intelligence officers and fbi agents and former agents retirees
[36:39.440 --> 36:43.120]  that fought this i mean because we demonize the fbi all day in these agencies they're
[36:43.120 --> 36:49.880]  captured by the globalists at the top but when i was growing up it was fbi agents and
[36:49.880 --> 36:54.520]  people would come over and play chess with my dad and drink scotch and just talk about
[36:54.520 --> 36:57.920]  it from the time i was like four years old right through i moved out of the house my
[36:57.920 --> 37:03.920]  dad's friends were all businessmen and engineers and scientists and fbi agents and federal
[37:03.920 --> 37:08.280]  marshals and all these people that knew what was going on and they all just knew this to
[37:08.280 --> 37:13.240]  then it wasn't their opinion they knew how the world worked hell berry goldwater back
[37:13.240 --> 37:18.920]  in the 60s and 70s had hearings and talked about everything that's now happened he almost
[37:18.920 --> 37:25.760]  became president they probably would assassinate him though so what i'm trying to explain to
[37:25.760 --> 37:33.440]  you is when i'm telling you has been known forever british intelligence in 1921 set up
[37:33.440 --> 37:40.880]  pratt house in new york city and they set it up to buy off the new york elite and have
[37:40.880 --> 37:46.200]  a merger of the british empire with the new america empire and that was done by world
[37:46.200 --> 37:53.920]  war two and winston church hill wrote three books called the histories of the english
[37:53.920 --> 37:58.520]  speaking peoples and by the third book and i by the way read the books they're riveting
[37:58.520 --> 38:02.960]  but i couldn't find them i was looking for them i guess when i moved five six years ago
[38:02.960 --> 38:09.520]  they're in storage somewhere i've got original volumes each one's about five hundred six
[38:09.520 --> 38:15.640]  hundred pages long big old hard covers and he admits it all in there but says it's a
[38:15.640 --> 38:22.200]  great thing well yeah if it actually promoted freedom and western ideas but that's not what
[38:22.200 --> 38:29.240]  it's doing it's promoting evil ladies and gentlemen and they have captured our governments
[38:29.240 --> 38:35.720]  they have captured the infrastructure and they've captured the agencies and that's why i told
[38:35.720 --> 38:40.200]  you the q thing was pure bull because at the top of the fbi and the top of the nsa and
[38:40.200 --> 38:46.200]  the top of the cia and the top of these courts is predominantly bad people they haven't gotten
[38:46.200 --> 38:49.400]  rid of all the good people there are some good supreme court justices there are some
[38:49.400 --> 38:56.960]  good federal judges but they are very close worldwide in controlling just the debauch
[38:56.960 --> 39:05.720]  group has over a hundred presidents prime ministers of countries in their control and
[39:05.720 --> 39:11.000]  i tried to get the numbers on governors and premiers which is governors in most areas
[39:11.000 --> 39:21.400]  and regional leaders and it's around half of the governors of the western world or
[39:21.400 --> 39:27.480]  premiers are under their control there's more than fifty members of congress and here's
[39:27.480 --> 39:32.880]  what's scary almost all the new democrats running and a bunch of republicans there so
[39:32.880 --> 39:37.200]  used to they had some now it's almost all they're they're they're involved you think
[39:37.200 --> 39:45.200]  stuff's bad now man they're about to have their people in control of everything everything
[39:45.200 --> 39:55.680]  everything you think that's a good thing folks you think you want to live under larry
[39:55.680 --> 40:06.000]  fink's control who defends literal slave camps and death camps in china that corporate attitude
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.160]  you see from the owner of the warriors basketball team saying i don't even think about the millions
[40:10.160 --> 40:16.240]  of people in death camps they don't even register in my mind they don't even enter my mind because
[40:16.240 --> 40:22.480]  you have a more evil statement they don't even register that they're beneath me oh maria
[40:22.480 --> 40:27.440]  entoinette the friends are starving the people are starving open the greenery give them some
[40:27.440 --> 40:32.560]  food or they're going to storm the palace and kill us and she reportedly said let them eat cake
[40:33.760 --> 40:40.640]  and then it got stormed the Bastille the prison and the guard facility of the corrupt police
[40:40.640 --> 40:44.320]  that was guarding the palace and within a couple days they all had their heads chopped off
[40:47.200 --> 40:51.680]  now did she really say let them eat cake or did somebody go tell them that
[40:51.680 --> 40:56.880]  when they were begging for food and the children were starving to death or did she or is it made
[40:56.880 --> 41:03.920]  up no one knows but we do know in modern times larry thinks that's up there and says the people
[41:03.920 --> 41:08.800]  are poor the middle class has been erased we must fix it by taking over these corrupt governments
[41:08.800 --> 41:14.000]  and bringing in a system that gives people a basic income when they're the ones making sure
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.720]  that the social safety net is broken and the small businesses are shut down and their lockdowns
[41:18.720 --> 41:23.040]  double their profits and destroyed the the infrastructure of the economy they're the ones
[41:23.040 --> 41:26.800]  that go out of their way to destroy us companies and us corporations
[41:30.320 --> 41:39.520]  and then larry thinks it's up there with chamath paula hapa tya and says nobody cares
[41:39.520 --> 41:43.360]  about the death camps and the genocide and that's liberal
[41:43.360 --> 41:48.960]  and claus swab and larry think and all of them
[41:51.920 --> 41:57.200]  so things are about to get real bad and when they do we're going to overthrow all the governments
[41:57.200 --> 42:02.800]  and put our corporate rule in and then they release the virus shut everything down trigger
[42:02.800 --> 42:09.280]  the operation they're all on video saying we need a catalyst to make them accept us as their saviors
[42:09.280 --> 42:17.680]  and then they talk about well maybe a virus will do it and then they go well maybe a cyber
[42:17.680 --> 42:26.000]  attack maybe a war and they're in there on all three points of that behind it on record i mean
[42:26.000 --> 42:32.720]  you're watching others trudeau giving larry thinking award and they wear a rainbow swastika
[42:32.720 --> 42:38.960]  that's the symbol of build back better is a rainbow swastika that's what he was pitting on him
[42:41.200 --> 42:46.800]  i mean god helps it's an organized crime group a mega bank with quadrillions of stolen money

[46:05.280 --> 46:13.200]  tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebel they would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[46:13.200 --> 46:19.520]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives but because of
[46:19.520 --> 46:25.920]  so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers now
[46:25.920 --> 46:32.400]  their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government
[46:32.400 --> 46:38.240]  corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever the problem is some
[46:38.240 --> 46:44.240]  globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover like canada they've now declared
[46:44.240 --> 46:50.000]  a civil emergency and martial law in ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like
[46:50.000 --> 46:55.760]  australia so pray for these folks big time it's a very serious situation and stay tuned into info
[46:55.760 --> 47:03.600]  wars dot com because truth is absolutely paramount leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new
[47:03.600 --> 47:19.520]  world order it's alex jones
[47:23.680 --> 47:28.000]  all right some final segment of the first hour i've been dope the phones up the second and third
[47:28.000 --> 47:35.280]  hour today and as promised in the month of march i'm gonna start doing three shows a week there are
[47:35.280 --> 47:40.160]  at least two hours a piece where they're commercial free and we take phone calls and have a special
[47:40.160 --> 47:45.520]  guest i did it on saturday for about two hours and 15 minutes came in of course we did four hours
[47:45.520 --> 47:50.960]  last night with mtg and owens royer but in this in these critical times every day is precious every
[47:50.960 --> 47:57.760]  day is special and there's nothing i like better than grilling hamburgers on my backyard watching
[47:57.760 --> 48:04.080]  my four-year-old daughter playing her sandbox uh and play with model airplanes and blow bubbles
[48:04.080 --> 48:12.400]  and act silly and watch cartoons but she doesn't have a future if i don't fight as hard as i can
[48:14.800 --> 48:19.280]  and that's why i need all of you to fight as hard as you can as well because we need to save my
[48:19.280 --> 48:23.680]  daughter we need to save your sons and daughters as well and we're gonna do it we need to man up
[48:23.680 --> 48:30.400]  we need to do what's right that's why i salute the truckers you know it's hard to even cover the
[48:30.400 --> 48:36.640]  truckers around the world and how great they are and how they stepped up it's hard working people
[48:36.640 --> 48:41.760]  that live in the real world and it's hard for me to even cover it because i feel like i'm not
[48:41.760 --> 48:45.520]  going to do it justice you know maybe we just shouldn't take calls today and i'm not just saying
[48:45.520 --> 48:50.960]  that for in effect i'm thinking about it right now and just play the devos group admitting they've
[48:50.960 --> 48:55.840]  conquered us and how they want to turn our power off and enslave us and how they want to depopulate
[48:55.840 --> 49:02.240]  us and just all their evil maybe we should just cover that play the clips and and then cover what's
[49:02.240 --> 49:08.240]  happened to the truckers in new zealand and australia and canada and i want to think the police
[49:08.240 --> 49:13.920]  are good people but they're just like anybody else they can be corrupted they can be purged they can
[49:13.920 --> 49:19.440]  be organized into evil and then set up upon the public and that's what claus wab talks about how
[49:19.440 --> 49:25.040]  they create a condition where the public has to rise up and then they march a bunch of police
[49:25.040 --> 49:32.960]  in against them and then the trigger takes place but i saw footage out of ukraine from where they
[49:32.960 --> 49:37.840]  were ordering people not to be allowed to protest or be in the streets for covet and the police there
[49:37.840 --> 49:42.720]  just dropped their shields and walked off and that's really the answer that's what the globalist
[49:42.720 --> 49:51.120]  want robots in control and technocracy in control because then humans can be cut out of the loop
[49:51.120 --> 50:00.400]  and there's not that human free will of whether the police are told attack folks that are out here
[50:00.400 --> 50:05.840]  peacefully demonstrating no we'll just drop our shields and leave that's the real courage you
[50:05.840 --> 50:11.120]  know they'd all been talking about it before they did it and then the one guy decides to do it
[50:11.120 --> 50:16.720]  and they orderly just go drop their shields in a pile for the city to come pick up they say you know
[50:16.720 --> 50:21.120]  what no we're not going to beat people over the head for being out here peacefully we're not going
[50:21.120 --> 50:27.760]  to stride on futures we're not idiots and that's what we should see that really happened in romania
[50:27.760 --> 50:31.280]  that really happened in many other parts of the world throughout history and it's the it's the
[50:31.280 --> 50:40.400]  the remake of that by the wachowski brothers in viva vendetta where the military is about to
[50:40.400 --> 50:46.640]  shoot this crowd of people all wearing guy fox mask and then the finally the colonel says stand
[50:46.640 --> 50:56.880]  down and then the tyranny falls instead you have the left and black lives matter george soros
[50:56.880 --> 51:01.680]  in blackface not black people organizing criminals to burn down cities and intimidated
[51:01.680 --> 51:07.200]  put their da's in to control who could be prosecuted trying to hold everybody hostage
[51:07.200 --> 51:14.960]  and people see through that americans don't support shooting up police stations burning down
[51:14.960 --> 51:21.680]  homeless shelters or running around burning down car dealerships no we don't support that
[51:23.360 --> 51:26.240]  but humans all over the world as well as americans do support
[51:27.440 --> 51:30.800]  truckers peacefully going and saying you want to put something in my body
[51:30.800 --> 51:34.640]  you want to control my life you want to tell me i got to have a digital past to
[51:34.640 --> 51:40.080]  to travel within a nation i'm going to peacefully sit here for three weeks losing money first they
[51:40.080 --> 51:45.360]  cut their money off take their bank accounts and then would pickaxes they smashed their windows
[51:45.360 --> 51:50.960]  but even when they agree to come out now as an example to everybody and there's up close footage
[51:50.960 --> 51:55.040]  some of these guys were live streaming when it happened the cops don't care they literally
[51:55.040 --> 52:00.320]  break their ribs beat their faces in with the butts of rifles and billy clubs knocked their
[52:00.320 --> 52:04.640]  teeth out i've got all the video and photos of people in the hospitals with their teeth knocked out
[52:04.640 --> 52:11.040]  their ribs broken and the left is all over twitter celebrating saying good follow police orders
[52:12.880 --> 52:15.760]  you know they're really lucky the hundred thousand plus people that first showed up
[52:15.760 --> 52:20.400]  didn't bring cans of gasoline and i'm not for that but if they really wanted a war with you guys
[52:21.360 --> 52:24.880]  you wouldn't see those cops out there if a hundred men fought back against them
[52:24.880 --> 52:28.560]  with weapons but see discretion is the greater part of valor they didn't
[52:28.560 --> 52:33.440]  they'll let you beat up the old ladies and run them over with horses and beat up the young men
[52:34.320 --> 52:38.880]  beat up the old men they'll sit there and let you break their ribs because they're like gondy
[52:38.880 --> 52:43.760]  they're like martin was the king jr following christ example they are simply putting their hands up
[52:44.400 --> 52:48.160]  and walking into the midst of the paramilitary troops most of which we know we're flown in
[52:48.160 --> 52:52.400]  they're not even canadiens we know dozens of un aircraft are now confirmed landing around
[52:52.400 --> 53:00.240]  auto with last week disgorging these men covering their faces so trados kneels for black lives matter
[53:00.960 --> 53:07.760]  and they loot shops and attack people but then when you try to peacefully stand and say i have
[53:07.760 --> 53:12.800]  human rights i have dignity well they ride over you by the way the the media tried to spin the
[53:12.800 --> 53:17.120]  old woman that got stepped on by the horse said oh she's fine it's made up she jumped in front of
[53:17.120 --> 53:23.040]  the horse no that's not true all the different videos have been released now and she's got broken
[53:23.040 --> 53:30.320]  ribs and bruised lung and heart and can't walk you ever had a Clydesdale step on you i haven't
[53:32.560 --> 53:37.280]  but uh i've been in a car wreck not wearing a seatbelt when i was a teenager and had five
[53:37.280 --> 53:40.960]  ribs broken let me tell you six weeks of excruciating pain every time you breathe
[53:40.960 --> 53:47.280]  and that's what that old lady got on her mobility scooter was a Clydesdale
[53:48.160 --> 53:52.800]  stepping on her chest how i wonder how that feels oh those are the big tough cops
[53:54.640 --> 53:58.560]  but you know what they couldn't get the cops in auto would do it they had to ship in special
[53:58.560 --> 54:03.040]  people with double triple pay from all over canada other areas who signed up to do this
[54:04.080 --> 54:08.720]  so when you see those thousands of thug police and the horrible things they've done on video
[54:08.720 --> 54:14.000]  remember that's not the majority of the police majority of the police were good men and women
[54:14.640 --> 54:22.720]  many have resigned including even the debauched group graduate police chief they had before
[54:22.720 --> 54:27.440]  he didn't want that his hands dirty his career might stop by this he resigned when they brought
[54:27.440 --> 54:32.160]  in this new guy and i'm not defending the institution of police just to defend it
[54:32.160 --> 54:35.840]  what i'm explaining is when you read the debauched group and watch their clips are like
[54:35.840 --> 54:41.360]  an angrier world things are destabilizing the governments cannot handle it they are bad
[54:41.360 --> 54:46.480]  we will save them so they trigger the collapse they run the policies to their operatives and then
[54:46.480 --> 54:51.040]  they want that's to think the revolution is attacking the police all that will do is drive
[54:51.040 --> 54:54.960]  out the good officers so they can bring the scum in and that's why you have the purge
[54:55.840 --> 55:01.200]  of the military and the police all of the world under crt and under the covet shots and all of it
[55:01.200 --> 55:06.720]  the left knows what it's doing getting rid of the smart people
[55:09.520 --> 55:15.120]  bringing in literal scum of the earth by the way i sent you guys a clip
[55:16.080 --> 55:21.680]  saturday i didn't get to it it's from a famous movie about the nazis and stuff and it's where
[55:21.680 --> 55:26.720]  the jewish man's not allowed to walk on the street gets beat up by the officers i meant to play that
[55:26.720 --> 55:32.800]  get get that for me next hour because i want to play that with the real clips where they are treating
[55:32.800 --> 55:38.320]  women in the street just like hollywood says nazis treated jews which the nazis did do that
[55:39.120 --> 55:43.200]  and it's oh my god it's so horrible when it's happening
[55:44.240 --> 55:50.000]  70 years ago 75 years ago but when it's happening in our countries it's a good thing and the left

[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  as jamie white writes australian police have been deploying directed energy weapons against the
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:39.040]  peaceful fring convoy protesters around the capital all right guys mrs. kossack is still
[1:00:39.040 --> 1:00:43.040]  in bit under the weather give everyone here people are feeling nauseous people are feeling
[1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:47.920]  a bit of vertigo that's the result of these police supersonic weapons it's amazing that
[1:00:47.920 --> 1:00:51.840]  they've got nearly what three quarters of a million people out here and they cannot even
[1:00:51.840 --> 1:00:56.320]  send one person out to talk to us not even one person you know at least come out and hear what
[1:00:56.320 --> 1:01:01.200]  our views are that's all we want to do is have our views expressed what do you feel just a bit of
[1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:08.080]  headache a big headache yeah for sure what about you sir how do you feel how do you feel my ears
[1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:13.840]  you can feel it in your ears yeah disturbing videos and photos circulating social media
[1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:20.080]  show canberra protesters including women and children who appear to have been badly burned
[1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:27.920]  by directed microwave energy weapons with blisters on their faces arms and torsos the use of
[1:01:27.920 --> 1:01:35.440]  directed energy weapons was thrown on the table as australian senators grilled the australia federal
[1:01:35.440 --> 1:01:41.920]  police commissioner riz kershaw pictures of the day appear to show some types of devices at the
[1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:46.160]  front of parliament house in between the entry to parliament and parliament lawns where the protest
[1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:51.840]  was in fact occurring can you confirm whether the afp had long-range acoustic devices at parliament
[1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:58.720]  house on saturday that would be something that is our police methodology which we would have to
[1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:05.680]  look at some sort of public interest immunity claim and i've been provided with this photograph which
[1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:12.400]  i'm happy to table electronically of course from distance does appear to show the deployment of an
[1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:19.520]  l-ray machine a long-range acoustic device i think it's cool which is a device designed to pitch sound
[1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:25.360]  at long range and can cause some pretty serious injuries you can't confirm even given that photo
[1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:29.680]  that that device was deployed on the day senator rantic i just want to interrupt here to make it
[1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:34.720]  clear that this question has already been taken on notice i understand that but do you have another
[1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:39.040]  do you have another benefit of having had that with the benefit of having had that that photograph
[1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:44.320]  which tends to confirm it um we still can't confirm that that device was was there on the day
[1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:51.920]  yeah i think to be proper i'd like to take that on notice in relation to yesterday's protest can i
[1:02:51.920 --> 1:02:57.920]  say how absolutely disgusted i was it broke my heart millions and millions of people across
[1:02:57.920 --> 1:03:03.440]  our state are doing the right thing and it just broke my heart that people had such a disregard
[1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:09.040]  for their fellow citizens i just ask everybody to think about that each of those people who
[1:03:09.040 --> 1:03:13.840]  protested illegally i'm sure have loved ones they're going to go home and risk passing that virus
[1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:19.600]  onto their most closest people to them with what we saw in sydney yesterday of course it was selfish
[1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:27.920]  it was also self-defeating it achieves no purpose it will not end the lockdown sooner it will only
[1:03:27.920 --> 1:03:33.600]  risk the lockdowns running further people understand there are frustrations with lockdowns but that
[1:03:33.600 --> 1:03:41.920]  type of behavior doesn't help anybody selfish behavior doesn't help anybody and so in a city
[1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:49.360]  under lockdown to engage in that was reckless and it was selfish even back in the united states this
[1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:56.400]  weapon has caused chaos in the u.s capital u.s officials say there are now 130 suspected victims
[1:03:56.400 --> 1:04:02.160]  mostly cia operatives and us diplomats being treated for brain injuries debilitating headaches
[1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:09.440]  and vertigo the targets they believe of a directed energy microwave weapon there's a mysterious direct
[1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:18.080]  energy weapon that is being used and it is causing in some cases permanent traumatic brain
[1:04:18.080 --> 1:04:24.720]  injury new indications suggest the incidents go as far back as 1996 two individuals working on the
[1:04:24.720 --> 1:04:31.360]  nsc believe they were targeted in 2019 and in 2020 just after the election the australian

[1:06:25.200 --> 1:06:30.720]  thank you so much for joining us ladies and gentlemen justin drudeau who says he wants to
[1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:36.720]  be a dictator that says he wants to be able to silence people for their speech he declared over
[1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:42.720]  a week ago a national emergency and suspended due process and said not just people that protest
[1:06:42.720 --> 1:06:48.800]  but people that support peaceful protest will have their bank accounts frozen his finance minister
[1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:56.560]  who's the deputy leader of the country is the co-chair of the debos group on the board of directors
[1:06:56.560 --> 1:07:02.720]  with claus schwaab and she says it's permanent now but trudeau is the public spokesperson so he's
[1:07:03.360 --> 1:07:10.400]  he's announcing it's 15 days to flatten the curve and then it's two years three years four years
[1:07:10.400 --> 1:07:17.200]  five years they want a global digital id he's now saying it'll be on your vaccine passport
[1:07:17.200 --> 1:07:21.040]  whether you're allowed to be places or not that was always where they were going
[1:07:21.040 --> 1:07:25.760]  always where they were taking us and they're just normalizing all this and then remember claus
[1:07:25.760 --> 1:07:30.320]  schwaab says we're gonna have leaders do bad things people will blame the governments it will
[1:07:30.320 --> 1:07:34.880]  collapse confidence in the system that will collapse and we'll come in with a new global currency
[1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:40.320]  and make them submit to us then we can social engineer them because we control the universal
[1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:46.160]  basic income this is very simple once you see it i can give you the good news they're in total
[1:07:46.160 --> 1:07:53.680]  panic mode right now total panic mode right now and don't know what to do because they were supposed
[1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:59.840]  to just blame the governments and just have civil wars and then on the ashes of that build back better
[1:08:01.360 --> 1:08:05.760]  that's the great reset how do i know that they write they write books like we're idiots talking
[1:08:05.760 --> 1:08:12.320]  about it like we can't read that but now they're figuring out whoa the proletariat is what schwaab
[1:08:12.320 --> 1:08:19.200]  calls the general public they figured out what we're doing let's back off a little but their own
[1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:25.520]  minions don't want to stop now they've got the taste for that power and so things are now getting
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:28.880]  out of control here's a few clips at your door you just came to press conference and then the
[1:08:28.880 --> 1:08:35.520]  situation in australia is so criminal ladies and gentlemen here's the dictator you see
[1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:43.120]  hi prime minister do we still need the emergencies act the blockades have been cleared parliament
[1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:49.520]  hill hill has been cleared do we still need it as i said the emergencies act is not something
[1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:58.800]  to undertake lightly and it's something that needs to be momentary temporary and proportional
[1:08:59.520 --> 1:09:04.880]  that's why every single day i'm receiving briefings and we are reflecting on how much
[1:09:04.880 --> 1:09:10.320]  longer the emergencies act needs to be in place we don't want to keep it in place a single day
[1:09:10.320 --> 1:09:18.480]  longer than necessary but even though the blockades are lifted across border openings right now
[1:09:19.440 --> 1:09:26.640]  even though things seem to be resolving very well in Ottawa this state of emergency is not
[1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:34.480]  over there continues to be real concerns about the coming days but we will continue to evaluate
[1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:41.440]  every single day whether or not it is time and we are able to lift this state of emergency
[1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:51.520]  community and liberty i can't imagine that anyone who votes no tonight is doing anything
[1:09:51.520 --> 1:10:00.560]  other than indicating that they don't trust the government to make incredibly momentous
[1:10:00.560 --> 1:10:08.560]  and important decisions at a very difficult time but like i said i am confident that the
[1:10:08.560 --> 1:10:14.880]  majority of parliamentarians will stand up to support our values to stand up support our
[1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:22.560]  democracy and stand up to support their fellow Canadians people talk about nlp and how they
[1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:26.480]  train these politicians how to talk and if you are in an unconscious state it works on you
[1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:33.520]  that's npr talk that cadence and how he talks and how it's going to be this way and oh my goodness
[1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:38.560]  and they all go to school for this at the debuts group and other groups on how to lie to you
[1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:45.280]  they want to collapse society they want to steal your property they want to run your children
[1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:50.080]  they want to depopulate you they want you to own nothing and have nothing they are the globalist
[1:10:50.080 --> 1:11:01.840]  they are the enemy they fall or we fall here is uh freeland the bill berg group chairman
[1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:09.120]  debuts group co-chair who's the finance minister telling you when they'll let your bank accounts
[1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:20.720]  reopen here it is uh and then finally let me say uh for anyone who is concerned that their
[1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:26.720]  accounts may have been frozen because of their participation in these illegal blockades and
[1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:36.480]  occupation the way to get your account unfrozen is to stop being part of the blockade and
[1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:43.280]  occupation this is this these measures were put in place to disrupt
[1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:50.240]  illegal activity in canada illegal activity you are the illegal activity so there's no
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:56.000]  number you call like a no fly list at nick pointes eight months later still on no criminal record
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:02.400]  did nothing wrong there's no you just oh you just stop we're watching you and then magically this
[1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:08.800]  new power up there that's the big ai larry think claus Schwab system of black rock then it will let

[1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:36.320]  a hundred thousand dollars a year now john bound is always doing a great job but he has really been
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:44.480]  on fire this weekend he put out three reports yesterday on sunday there at bandot video you
[1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:51.040]  click on the left hand corner there and find the john bound section the bound report b o w n e
[1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:56.480]  and it's all right there we already play the canadian great reset that we play the australian
[1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:00.640]  great reset earlier we have the new zealand great reset and those that's the same people the same
[1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:06.560]  actors the same globalists but in this one you got to watch the australian great reset because
[1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:13.840]  they've got not just sound cannons they've got microwave guns on record shooting women and
[1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:19.520]  children it can it can cause major brain damage and then the the same thing is said in canada
[1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:23.840]  the same thing is said in australian new zealand they go oh here in the government we can't ask
[1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:33.040]  questions of the police we can't question police tactics so it's secret you see we're going to
[1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:38.000]  shoot something at you that that it's been ruled internationally illegal to use we're going to use
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:43.120]  it on our own people and put blisters and brain damage little children because there's three
[1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:50.880]  quarters of a million people in cambera the capital protesting saying stop it stop it it's not about
[1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:55.600]  a virus it's about locking us up and training us we're prisoners till we take digital ids
[1:13:56.720 --> 1:14:02.080]  that you can then tax and track and control what crimes you have committed i'ma say something
[1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:10.800]  again about trudot hitler was elected as a parliamentarian as the president of germany
[1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:17.840]  with less than 30 percent of the vote then he became chancellor after the firebombing of their

[1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:26.960]  its ashes their their transhumanist nightmare vision suppressing the voices of good people
[1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:33.120]  all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives
[1:18:33.120 --> 1:18:39.200]  their covetous area their world's gonna end in 2030 carbon tax global warming bull all of it
[1:18:39.760 --> 1:18:45.200]  and none of it can succeed none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:50.960]  silenced and gas lit that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence
[1:18:50.960 --> 1:18:55.440]  and that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and band up video links that's why we've
[1:18:55.440 --> 1:19:07.280]  got to share them now more than ever from the words of chuck pollinique's fight club

[1:19:54.000 --> 1:20:17.840]  com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:36.240]  well this is breaking as we speak latimer putin is set to address the world sometime in the next
[1:20:36.240 --> 1:20:43.920]  hour we'll see what he's going to announce probably that there have been western attacks on
[1:20:43.920 --> 1:20:51.600]  russian held areas in eastern ukraine that he is going to take those sectors or perhaps it's
[1:20:51.600 --> 1:20:57.440]  that he's going to give them an ultimatum for nato to say that they're not going to take ukraine
[1:20:59.920 --> 1:21:04.640]  and they will stop shipping heavy weapons into their border sectors or that he's going to invade
[1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:12.400]  clearly this has all been done to put pressure on expansions nato to get them to back down and
[1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:20.960]  recognize russia's legitimate security concerns but the globalists hate god so they love war
[1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:27.120]  they hate god so they hate families and they hate russia because russia is now having a
[1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:33.600]  multi-child policy just like china putin set to address nation on television
[1:21:36.240 --> 1:21:48.560]  coming up and that again is in the next hour or so we will be watching all of that as that unfolds
[1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:54.240]  and have that punched up on our screens the best place to go i guess will be rt america
[1:21:54.240 --> 1:22:00.800]  you can even still get that in the us and uh have that feed up so we'll have a translation of what's
[1:22:00.800 --> 1:22:05.200]  being said that that's a big deal we're going to be watching all of that very very closely
[1:22:07.680 --> 1:22:14.000]  here's some of the headlines putin embarrasses biden after white house summit announcement

[1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:09.840]  you some of the headlines transgender prisons inmates reportedly getting women pregnant after
[1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:16.240]  california law allows men house with women and then the headlines in the la time say how wonderful
[1:25:16.240 --> 1:25:23.040]  two women had a baby many of the women report they're being raped but that's okay because
[1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:28.960]  they're transgender and then now you got this speaking of camps outrage parents demand answers
[1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:37.920]  after non-binary male counselors adults were allowed to sleep with fifth grade girls in the
[1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:48.720]  same room so adult men with penises are sleeping in the dorm in the the little cabins with your
[1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:59.200]  daughters because they say oh we're just non-binary and that's what the state law says
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:05.520]  so there's your sex camps right there and it gets a lot worse here in austin
[1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:09.920]  this is austin public library calling all high school students get paid to learn about sex
[1:26:09.920 --> 1:26:17.120]  education over spring break free classes on the evidence-based lgbtq1a friendly courses

[1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:27.680]  at least they're just targeting high schoolers here but still all sexualization all sexual
[1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:31.440]  just like you see with the number four guy at facebook resigning when he flew to indianapolis
[1:26:31.440 --> 1:26:39.680]  reportedly have sex with a 13 year old and that's why literacy is plunging that's why everything's
[1:26:39.680 --> 1:26:44.080]  falling apart because you don't learn about reading writing arithmetic or street smarts or how to
[1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:49.280]  plant a garden or how to balance a checkbook you learn about things that i didn't know about till

[1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:23.840]  this is how they take over they intend for there to be girls raped at these things
[1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:27.440]  and then the schools just go under and the very lawyers that run the whole thing make money
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:30.480]  so they took the Vatican over so they took the catholic church over
[1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:38.960]  chicago schools over condoms of fifth graders society's changed fifth graders police in germany

[1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:54.080]  way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so
[1:32:54.080 --> 1:33:04.240]  much for your call and godspeed leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's
[1:33:04.240 --> 1:33:16.240]  alex jones
[1:33:21.840 --> 1:33:27.040]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:33:27.040 --> 1:33:31.040]  so
[1:33:31.440 --> 1:33:36.320]  well as i said earlier in the hour before it was announced i said putin will probably
[1:33:38.400 --> 1:33:44.080]  declare areas of eastern ukraine to be recognized as autonomous zones now of russia
[1:33:45.440 --> 1:33:49.280]  and that is exactly what russian state media is now saying he's going to be speaking the next
[1:33:49.280 --> 1:33:54.560]  20 30 minutes we'll be carrying that live we found an english translation of it on fox
[1:33:54.560 --> 1:34:01.760]  it's putin set to recognize don boss president latimer putin has told foreign leaders that
[1:34:01.760 --> 1:34:09.040]  moscow is likely to officially recognize the sovereignty of denest and lugansk people's
[1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:14.080]  republics in ukraine's war-torn east the statement released on monday the kremlin
[1:34:14.080 --> 1:34:19.920]  revealed that putin has notified prince president america ron and german chancellor olof schultz
[1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:25.840]  that the intends to sign a decree recognizing the two separatist regions in the near future
[1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:30.480]  according to officials and two leaders expressing their disappointment and what he's going to say
[1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:35.360]  is if they continue to get attacked that will be an attack on russia and he's got the weapons there
[1:34:35.360 --> 1:34:43.680]  to stop the attack so that is a very measured move by russia i don't again say that putin's
[1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:48.640]  an angel or perfect or anything i just state the facts that the west over through that country
[1:34:48.640 --> 1:34:54.400]  with george soros the west been attacking that almost 100 russian area and russia was founded
[1:34:54.400 --> 1:34:59.360]  in ukraine and the globalists want to take over sovereign countries i didn't support the serbs
[1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:03.760]  i'm not saying they're perfect but they didn't start those wars and the clinton's bombing them
[1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:08.000]  i doesn't mean that they didn't commit some atrocities but even the unit admits twice as
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:16.720]  many serbs died as muslims and croats they're in bosnian bosnians i'm sure everybody's got stories
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:22.080]  on either side you know it's like if you're a black person that racist white people beat up you can
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:25.600]  think that white people are bad or if you're a white person that got robbed or attacked by
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:30.880]  racist black people because you were white you can hate all black people that's not how i operate
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:37.440]  but in these ethnic and cultural wars i look for who starts it and who loses the most people
[1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:40.160]  and the west is starting this
[1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:47.360]  i want to get your take on this i want to open the phones up on
[1:35:50.880 --> 1:35:57.440]  the obsession of the left to put biological men in the showers and in the bedrooms with little
[1:35:57.440 --> 1:36:03.680]  girls it's a capturing it's a revolution it's taken over the schools it's taken over the jails
[1:36:03.680 --> 1:36:08.160]  it's taking over the sports it's taking over the dormitories it's taking over the life
[1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:13.680]  and the same groups are saying don't say mother or father i want to talk about that one about the
[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:18.000]  russian situation with ukraine i want to talk about canada i want to talk about the l rads and
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:24.400]  the and the radiation and the microwave guns being used on people in australia and the prime
[1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:29.840]  minister going well i don't get involved with the police do what weird application of authority is
[1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:37.680]  that to excuse it's criminal i want to get your take on all of these issues here i want to talk
[1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:43.440]  to first-time callers 877-789-2539 first-time callers want to hear from you give you a chance to get
[1:36:43.440 --> 1:36:54.720]  on board 877-789-2539-877-789-2539 or if your country code doesn't let you call a 1-800 number
[1:36:55.360 --> 1:37:05.520]  01-512-646-1776 01-512-646-1776 and i do intend to do some shows in the next few days
[1:37:05.520 --> 1:37:11.040]  where we just take calls from folks in ukraine and russia or we just take calls from people in
[1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:19.760]  canada australia and new zealand under the worst great reset operations but today it's it's it's
[1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:28.240]  wide open first-time callers on all of those issues 877-789-2539 let's go to the kt la piece
[1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:34.000]  that i mentioned that's also uh in the marjorie taylor green interview i did yesterday that's
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:39.920]  also very powerful on the subject of what this means this is if you'll accept a man can have a
[1:37:39.920 --> 1:37:45.520]  baby and if you'll accept full grown men with your elementary school daughters in the fifth grade
[1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:51.200]  sleeping in the bunks with them you'll accept anything that's what they're handing out condoms
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:56.560]  to five-year-olds in public schools everywhere or to fifth graders excuse me to 10-year-olds
[1:37:56.560 --> 1:38:00.720]  because they they want the state involved in the sexual activity of your children because they know
[1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:05.920]  if they can get you promiscuous at a young age on average you don't form lasting relationships
[1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:12.160]  and it depopulates and see it's all in the documents why they do it and it's so evil
[1:38:14.800 --> 1:38:19.440]  it's so sick the videos on band-op video breaking mtg response to biological men sleeping with
[1:38:19.440 --> 1:38:27.600]  elementary school girls at state sponsored camp but let's go to the kt la piece and listen to this
[1:38:27.600 --> 1:38:35.840]  mind control parents mad people that identify as they them could sleep in girls cabins with young
[1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:43.440]  girls at science camp no it's men taking over women's spaces taking over their sports taking over
[1:38:43.440 --> 1:38:50.400]  everybody yet raping them in prison and it's all done to train you that they have access to groom
[1:38:50.400 --> 1:38:55.920]  your children the whole thing's pedophilic the whole thing is transhuman the whole thing is evil
[1:38:55.920 --> 1:39:02.240]  and all the major public schools and the Boy Scouts and all of it is taken over folks that's why
[1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:08.480]  they again 12 years ago 14 years ago handed out condoms to 10-year-olds again and they had giant
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:14.800]  pedophilic events orgies raping your children and i said it's going to bring down the Boy Scouts
[1:39:14.800 --> 1:39:19.600]  destroy a good christian organization and it did done by the left on purpose they know what
[1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:24.800]  they're doing it's indoctrination centers so your children can't learn to go camp and build a fire
[1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:30.960]  tie a knot or go fishing or how to shoot a bow and arrow how to shoot a rifle no you go and pedophiles
[1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:34.880]  just like the ones that took over the catholic church screw your children over literally and
[1:39:34.880 --> 1:39:42.160]  figuratively and it's all their plan to destroy the family and have the final revolution take over
[1:39:42.160 --> 1:39:47.600]  the cia ran giant child kidnapping rings in germany with the cps with the family courts to
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:54.880]  create the new family which is men with boys women with women totally screwed up totally sick
[1:39:54.880 --> 1:40:01.200]  totally segregated satanic here's the report micah the parents tell us that their children came
[1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:06.800]  home from camp they were asking a lot of questions about gender and pronouns the parents then reached
[1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:12.400]  out to the camp director who told them that counselors biological males who identify as they
[1:40:12.400 --> 1:40:20.720]  them are permitted to spend the night in cabins with the young girls in the parking lot of weaver
[1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:25.840]  elementary school in los alamitos a group of parents no parents should feel the way i feel
[1:40:25.840 --> 1:40:30.880]  after knowing what could have happened to my daughter upset by the sleeping arrangements at
[1:40:30.880 --> 1:40:36.400]  a school organized science camp i contacted the school and i asked them if they were able to
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:42.080]  confirm that there was not a man actually sleeping in the same cabin as the girls uh they were not
[1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:47.360]  able to confirm that the parents say their fifth grade girls told them some of the biologically
[1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:54.160]  male counselors at camp alley in san bernadino identified as they them and spent three nights
[1:40:54.160 --> 1:41:00.720]  sleeping in cabins with the young girls they're asleep they use the shower they go to the restroom
[1:41:00.720 --> 1:41:07.440]  camp alley confirms per california state law we play staff in cabins they identify with parents
[1:41:07.440 --> 1:41:13.200]  say they're not accusing anyone of a crime but they are angry the school district did not let
[1:41:13.200 --> 1:41:18.560]  parents know about the policy a spokesperson told us the district takes all complaints and
[1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:24.960]  concerns seriously and is currently investigating these parents say they just want others to be
[1:41:24.960 --> 1:41:31.840]  informed of the policy so they can make decisions for their own families it's awful that children
[1:41:31.840 --> 1:41:36.320]  had to even experience of this in fifth grade camp if i was aware of it and i had initialed
[1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:43.040]  something saying that this was going to be done at this outdoor science camp i would have kept my
[1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:50.720]  child home yeah so those parents insist that they should have been informed about this policy before
[1:41:50.720 --> 1:41:55.360]  they sent their kids off to camp and now they want the school district to step up they want them to
[1:41:55.360 --> 1:42:00.720]  inform the parents of the hundreds of other kids who were also on that trip we're live tonight los

[1:47:25.400 --> 1:47:27.400]  Vladimir Putin has just taken the podium
[1:47:27.400 --> 1:47:30.400]  and here on The Alex Jones Show we're going to go to this announcement
[1:47:30.400 --> 1:47:34.400]  by the Russian leader about the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe
[1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:37.400]  in the proxy war that is Ukraine.
[1:47:37.400 --> 1:47:39.400]  Here it is.
[1:47:39.400 --> 1:47:46.400]  Of course, my address is also aimed at our fellow citizens in Ukraine.
[1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:51.400]  We'll have to have a substantive and detailed conversation
[1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:55.400]  because the matter is very serious.
[1:47:55.400 --> 1:48:00.400]  Situation in Donbass is becoming critical.
[1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:04.400]  And today I'm addressing you directly,
[1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:07.400]  not only to talk about what's happening,
[1:48:07.400 --> 1:48:10.400]  but also to inform you about the decisions we're making,
[1:48:10.400 --> 1:48:13.400]  about possible steps in this regard.
[1:48:13.400 --> 1:48:17.400]  Once again, I would like to honor a score that Ukraine is not just a neighbor,
[1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:21.400]  neighboring country to us, it is an inherent part of our own history,
[1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:24.400]  culture, spiritual space.
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:31.400]  They are our comrades, relatives, not only colleagues, friends,
[1:48:31.400 --> 1:48:39.400]  but also our family, people we have blood and family ties with.
[1:48:39.400 --> 1:48:44.400]  Since ancient times, people from ancient southwestern Russian lands
[1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:49.400]  were calling themselves Russians and Orthodox.
[1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:53.400]  That was happening until 17th century when part of these territories
[1:48:53.400 --> 1:48:57.400]  rejoined the Russian Empire, the Russian state.
[1:48:57.400 --> 1:49:01.400]  And after that, it seems that we know all about this,
[1:49:01.400 --> 1:49:05.400]  that we are talking about facts that everyone knows.
[1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:08.400]  But at the same time, we need to have understanding
[1:49:08.400 --> 1:49:13.400]  what is happening today to explain motives and aims that Russia has.
[1:49:13.400 --> 1:49:20.400]  We need to say a couple of words about the history of this matter.
[1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:23.400]  I would like to start by saying that the modern Ukraine
[1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:30.400]  was completely created by Russia to be more exact by Bolsheviks,
[1:49:30.400 --> 1:49:32.400]  Bolshevik Communist Russia.
[1:49:32.400 --> 1:49:37.400]  This process has started almost immediately after the 1917 revolution.
[1:49:37.400 --> 1:49:45.400]  And Lenin and his supporters did it in a rough way.
[1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:53.400]  If we talk about Russia, they were alienating parts of historical territories of Russia.
[1:49:53.400 --> 1:50:01.400]  And millions of people who lived there, obviously, no one asked anything.
[1:50:01.400 --> 1:50:08.400]  Then before the Great Patriotic War in Naples, Stalin added to the USSR
[1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:14.400]  and handed over to Ukraine some lands that belonged to Poland and Hungary.
[1:50:14.400 --> 1:50:22.400]  And as a compensation, Stalin gave some ancient German lands to Poland.
[1:50:22.400 --> 1:50:27.400]  And in the 1960s, Khrushchev decided to take Crimea away from Russia
[1:50:27.400 --> 1:50:29.400]  and also gave it to Ukraine.
[1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:33.400]  That's how the territory of the Soviet Ukraine was formed.
[1:50:33.400 --> 1:50:42.400]  But now I would like to draw your attention to the initial stages of the establishment of the USSR.
[1:50:42.400 --> 1:50:47.400]  I think it's of utmost importance for us because we have to start from afar.
[1:50:47.400 --> 1:50:53.400]  I would like to remind you that after the October revolution of 1917
[1:50:53.400 --> 1:51:00.400]  the Civil War that followed Bolsheviks started building a new state.
[1:51:00.400 --> 1:51:02.400]  And they had some differences among them.
[1:51:02.400 --> 1:51:11.400]  Stalin, who in 1922 was at the same time Secretary General of the Soviet Communist Party
[1:51:11.400 --> 1:51:14.400]  and people commissar on the merits of ethnicities,
[1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:19.400]  decided to build the country on the principles of autonomy.
[1:51:19.400 --> 1:51:24.400]  It was giving to the republics to the future administrative units
[1:51:24.400 --> 1:51:28.400]  wide authority when they were supposed to join the state.
[1:51:28.400 --> 1:51:33.400]  Lenin criticized this plan and he suggested to make concessions to the nationalists
[1:51:33.400 --> 1:51:40.400]  the way he called them back then advocates of independence.
[1:51:40.400 --> 1:51:45.400]  Basically, that was the idea about creating a consideration
[1:51:45.400 --> 1:51:48.400]  and give the right to every nation for self-determination.
[1:51:48.400 --> 1:51:50.400]  That was the basis of the Soviet state.
[1:51:50.400 --> 1:51:56.400]  First in 1922 it was enshrined in the declaration on the establishment of the Soviet Union
[1:51:56.400 --> 1:52:03.400]  and then after the death of Lenin it was also enshrined in the constitution of the USSR of 1924.
[1:52:03.400 --> 1:52:06.400]  And right away here we have a lot of questions.
[1:52:06.400 --> 1:52:08.400]  It raises a lot of questions.
[1:52:08.400 --> 1:52:18.400]  And first of them and the main question, why were they making all kinds of concessions
[1:52:18.400 --> 1:52:24.400]  to the nationalists at the outskirts of the former empire?
[1:52:24.400 --> 1:52:31.400]  To give to the administrative units that were haphazardly formed huge territories.
[1:52:31.400 --> 1:52:34.400]  Often times that had nothing to do with them.
[1:52:34.400 --> 1:52:40.400]  And they were giving these territories with the population of historic Russia.
[1:52:40.400 --> 1:52:47.400]  And these administrative units were given status and shape of the state entities.
[1:52:47.400 --> 1:52:54.400]  And once again this begs the question, why did they have to do such generous gifts?
[1:52:54.400 --> 1:52:58.400]  Even the most blatant nationalists couldn't dream of.
[1:52:58.400 --> 1:53:06.400]  And at the same time give the republic a right to withdraw from the new state without any preconditions.
[1:53:06.400 --> 1:53:09.400]  At first glance it doesn't seem clear.
[1:53:09.400 --> 1:53:14.400]  It seems like madness but only at first glance because there is an explanation.
[1:53:14.400 --> 1:53:21.400]  After the revolution the main goal Bolshevik's had was to keep power, to stay at power at any coast.
[1:53:21.400 --> 1:53:30.400]  And for this they went to any length to sign humiliating conditions of the breast.
[1:53:30.400 --> 1:53:40.400]  Truths when the Kaiser's Germany were in the dire economic situation and the outcome of the World War I was already almost decided.
[1:53:40.400 --> 1:53:45.400]  And by giving any concessions to the nationalists inside the country.
[1:53:45.400 --> 1:53:54.400]  From the point of view of the historic destiny of Russian people Lenin's principles of building the state weren't a mere mistake.
[1:53:54.400 --> 1:53:58.400]  That was much worse than a mere mistake.
[1:53:58.400 --> 1:54:05.400]  After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 this has become absolutely obvious.
[1:54:05.400 --> 1:54:14.400]  Of course what happened in the past cannot be changed but at least we have to talk about it in honest and direct way.
[1:54:14.400 --> 1:54:20.400]  Without any political agenda, without giving any political color to it.
[1:54:20.400 --> 1:54:30.400]  I can only add that the ideas of the current political realities no matter how beneficial they might seem currently.
[1:54:30.400 --> 1:54:38.400]  Under no circumstances cannot and should not be a basis of the building a state.
[1:54:38.400 --> 1:54:41.400]  I'm not blaming anyone, accusing anyone of anything.
[1:54:41.400 --> 1:54:44.400]  This is live but we can pause it when we come back.
[1:54:44.400 --> 1:54:46.400]  We're going to get through all this. I know I already gave the number up.
[1:54:46.400 --> 1:54:49.400]  We're going to get all your calls too. Who knows how long Putin's going to go.
[1:54:49.400 --> 1:54:51.400]  But we're going to come back and get to it.
[1:54:51.400 --> 1:54:57.400]  Again, I've studied history. I've never heard a modern world leader be this honest.
[1:54:57.400 --> 1:55:00.400]  He's like, yeah, we came in and heard the Ukrainians.
[1:55:00.400 --> 1:55:02.400]  But it was ours to begin with.
[1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:05.400]  And Lenin gave it all away to begin with. It's always been part of us.
[1:55:05.400 --> 1:55:07.400]  And yeah, then we came in and it didn't mean things to him.
[1:55:07.400 --> 1:55:11.400]  And yeah, I mean, what do you want to do? And he's going to probably go on and say, you want to be part of Europe?
[1:55:11.400 --> 1:55:14.400]  You want to be part of the New World Order? You want your sons taught to have their balls cut off?
[1:55:14.400 --> 1:55:17.400]  Because that's really what this comes down to.
[1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:21.400]  Because the West is going to put your kids with adults and pedophiles.
[1:55:21.400 --> 1:55:23.400]  I mean, the West is run by pedophiles now.
[1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:26.400]  And I guarantee he'll probably bring up something like that.
[1:55:26.400 --> 1:55:32.400]  Because he wants to go back to Russia being Russia and things that were part of Russia be part of Russia.
[1:55:32.400 --> 1:55:34.400]  He doesn't want the other parts that weren't part of Russia.
[1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:39.400]  And my issue is, render under Caesar the things that are Caesars.
[1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:42.400]  We are not over there in Russia. They are not attacking us.
[1:55:42.400 --> 1:55:46.400]  The same globalists that cut off our pipelines have cut off their pipelines.
[1:55:46.400 --> 1:55:51.400]  And it needs to stop. Our enemy is in Hollywood. Our enemy runs Washington, D.C.
[1:55:51.400 --> 1:55:54.400]  Our enemy is not Russia.
[1:55:54.400 --> 1:55:59.400]  And it's because of that, the globalists say they're the main enemy.
[1:55:59.400 --> 1:56:02.400]  Because Russia has gotten out from the New World Order grasp.
[1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:04.400]  It has its own problems.
[1:56:04.400 --> 1:56:06.400]  Leave Russia to the Russians.
[1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:11.400]  The issue is the great reset in Klaus Schwab and the worldwide lockdown
[1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:16.400]  and global depression and 40-plus million people, they starved to death during that lockdown.
[1:56:16.400 --> 1:56:17.400]  We're going to see where he goes.
[1:56:17.400 --> 1:56:20.400]  Because this was live. Now it's going to be, you know, now it's in tape.
[1:56:20.400 --> 1:56:22.400]  We're going to come back. I don't know what Putin's going to say.
[1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:28.400]  I predict before this even happened, he would say they're going to annex, you know, eastern Ukraine fully.
[1:56:28.400 --> 1:56:31.400]  And then if there's any attacks on it, they'll then attack Ukraine.
[1:56:31.400 --> 1:56:34.400]  So this is just the beginning of a larger war, in my view.
[1:56:34.400 --> 1:56:36.400]  It's a serious situation.
[1:56:36.400 --> 1:56:44.400]  And it's the consequences of Soros and the New World Order wanting to start a war with Russia.
[1:56:44.400 --> 1:56:45.400]  It's very, very simple.
[1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:47.400]  While they sell us out to China and others.
[1:56:47.400 --> 1:56:50.400]  Separately, ladies and gentlemen, we'll open the phones up after Putin's done
[1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:55.400]  and take your calls or if he runs on forever about history, we'll have to just dissect the transcript.
[1:56:55.400 --> 1:56:56.400]  Still fascinating stuff.
[1:56:56.400 --> 1:57:02.400]  Please remember, I can't finance this operation without you and I appreciate you keeping us on air under all these attacks as we are loyal Americans,
[1:57:02.400 --> 1:57:05.400]  promoting basic American values.

[1:58:57.400 --> 1:59:00.400]  And when it comes to information, boy is that true.
[1:59:00.400 --> 1:59:07.400]  Today we see the entire global corrupt, anti-human depopulation, great reset combine,
[1:59:07.400 --> 1:59:13.400]  trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision,
[1:59:13.400 --> 1:59:20.400]  suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[1:59:20.400 --> 1:59:26.400]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's gonna end in 2030,
[1:59:26.400 --> 1:59:29.400]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[1:59:29.400 --> 1:59:36.400]  And none of it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[1:59:36.400 --> 1:59:41.400]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[1:59:41.400 --> 1:59:45.400]  And that's why it's hard to share info wars links and band up video links.
[1:59:45.400 --> 2:00:06.400]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[2:00:06.400 --> 2:00:13.400]  Alright, let's go back to Putin who was live when we were watching it, we've now paused it so it's taped to air.
[2:00:13.400 --> 2:00:18.400]  So we can hear what he's saying about what's about to happen in Eastern Europe, in Ukraine, here it is.
[2:00:18.400 --> 2:00:28.400]  You say that that's how it happened, that's a fact, that's a historical fact.
[2:00:28.400 --> 2:00:36.400]  And as a result of Bolshevik's policy, the Soviet Ukraine was created and we have every reason to say now
[2:00:36.400 --> 2:00:44.400]  that it's Ukraine created by Vladimir Lenin. He is its creator and architect.
[2:00:44.400 --> 2:00:55.400]  And it's fully confirmed by the documents from the archives, also including the decrease, Lenin's decrease regarding Donbass,
[2:00:55.400 --> 2:01:03.400]  that was added to Ukraine and now grateful the sentence demolishing all the statues, all the monuments to Lenin.
[2:01:03.400 --> 2:01:07.400]  They call it decommunization.
[2:01:07.400 --> 2:01:12.400]  You want decommunization? Well, we are quite happy with that.
[2:01:12.400 --> 2:01:23.400]  But don't stop halfway. We are ready to show you what would mean actual decommunization for Ukraine.
[2:01:23.400 --> 2:01:31.400]  Coming back to the history of the matter, I would like to remind you that back in 1922
[2:01:31.400 --> 2:01:36.400]  at the territory of the former Russian Empire, the Soviet Union was established,
[2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:47.400]  but the reality showed that keeping this territory and ruling this territory using the principles of consideration
[2:01:47.400 --> 2:01:55.400]  seems impossible because it had nothing to do neither with the realities nor with the historical tradition.
[2:01:55.400 --> 2:02:01.400]  And the red terror and switch to the Stalin's purges and the monopoly of the Communist Party,
[2:02:01.400 --> 2:02:10.400]  nationalization, planned economy, all that in reality was turned into a formality, nothing more.
[2:02:10.400 --> 2:02:15.400]  Principles that were declared but didn't actually work.
[2:02:15.400 --> 2:02:20.400]  In reality, Soviet republics had no sovereign rights. None.
[2:02:20.400 --> 2:02:27.400]  In practice, what was created strictly centralized, unitarian in its character.
[2:02:27.400 --> 2:02:37.400]  State that was centralized, Stalin implemented not Lenin's ideas, but his own ideas of how states should be built.
[2:02:37.400 --> 2:02:45.400]  But changes to the founding acts, to the constitution, he didn't make any changes in this regard.
[2:02:45.400 --> 2:02:52.400]  Lenin's principles about building the Soviet Union were not reconsidered technically.
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:58.400]  It seemed there was no need in this under totalitarian regime, authoritarian regime.
[2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:01.400]  Everything worked well and it looked nice from the outside.
[2:03:01.400 --> 2:03:07.400]  It looked more than democratic even, but still it's a shame.
[2:03:07.400 --> 2:03:08.400]  It's a shame.
[2:03:08.400 --> 2:03:17.400]  Folks, I've been around 48 years and I've been on there 28 years, and I've seen a lot of crazy stuff.
[2:03:17.400 --> 2:03:21.400]  And I knew that Putin destroyed a meeting with Shultz and eats him in the last decade of his life.
[2:03:21.400 --> 2:03:27.400]  And I know people that reportedly know Putin and say, no, he's an anti-New World Order,
[2:03:27.400 --> 2:03:32.400]  and I'm not naive. I don't go, oh, Putin must be great, but now you see it more and more.
[2:03:32.400 --> 2:03:38.400]  Vladimir Putin repudiating communism, saying it's horrible, he may have come out and say,
[2:03:38.400 --> 2:03:42.400]  Western power is put Lenin in, because I know Putin knows that now,
[2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:45.400]  and that Russia has gotten free from this to a certain extent,
[2:03:45.400 --> 2:03:49.400]  and that we need to get free of this globalism as well, these parasites,
[2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:52.400]  and then we can have real peace and an incredible future.
[2:03:52.400 --> 2:03:56.400]  I mean, folks, Russia's got three times the resources the U.S. does.
[2:03:56.400 --> 2:03:58.400]  I mean, it's the richest country in the world.
[2:03:58.400 --> 2:04:03.400]  We should have a huge deal with them and be working with them,
[2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:05.400]  but again, the globalists don't like that.
[2:04:05.400 --> 2:04:08.400]  They want to use a Chinese slave colony to leverage everybody out.
[2:04:08.400 --> 2:04:11.400]  They want to implode the Third World to starve them to death, to flood the West,
[2:04:11.400 --> 2:04:15.400]  so the West collapse, and then madness have a war with the damn Russians.
[2:04:15.400 --> 2:04:20.400]  I mean, it's just the stupidest thing you would do for prosperity and peace
[2:04:20.400 --> 2:04:22.400]  in a future the world's ever seen.
[2:04:22.400 --> 2:04:26.400]  And, you know, I don't see how you see any fault in Putin, what he's saying.
[2:04:26.400 --> 2:04:28.400]  I mean, it's all historically true.
[2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:32.400]  Stalin's horrible, Lenin's horrible, we're sorry what we did to you, blah, blah, blah.
[2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:34.400]  What do you want to, I mean, you know it's coming.
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:37.400]  You want to be under George Soros, or you want to be your own country.
[2:04:37.400 --> 2:04:40.400]  We don't want you. We want to do business with you.
[2:04:40.400 --> 2:04:43.400]  Just, just please, please don't go to war with us.
[2:04:43.400 --> 2:04:49.400]  I mean, and to hear somebody actually tell the truth from that level is powerful,
[2:04:49.400 --> 2:04:56.400]  because the truth is powerful, and the truth lives in info wars.
[2:05:20.400 --> 2:05:24.400]  Because everybody needs this old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[2:05:24.400 --> 2:05:29.400]  You need what's in winter, sun, and then we have brain force, ultra,
[2:05:29.400 --> 2:05:35.400]  super fast acting, amazing, clean, neutropic system that is a compliment
[2:05:35.400 --> 2:05:38.400]  to brain force plus, and of course, turbo force.
[2:05:38.400 --> 2:05:42.400]  All three of these are different formulas, but all three of them take your mind
[2:05:42.400 --> 2:05:45.400]  and take your focus and clarity and alertness to the next level.

[2:05:55.400 --> 2:06:19.400]  infowarstore.com.
[2:06:26.400 --> 2:06:31.400]  All right, Vladimir Putin has concluded his speech about eight minutes ago,
[2:06:31.400 --> 2:06:35.400]  but we paused it in live time, and he just joined us.
[2:06:35.400 --> 2:06:38.400]  Unbelievable truth.
[2:06:38.400 --> 2:06:43.400]  I mean, and look, I must say that Gush is over leaders or people or any of those,
[2:06:43.400 --> 2:06:49.400]  and I know Russia's got serious corruption problems and everything else, believe me.
[2:06:49.400 --> 2:06:53.400]  But, I mean, everything Putin said so far is dead on historically accurate.
[2:06:53.400 --> 2:06:58.400]  He just apologized for the communist taking over Ukraine and killing people.
[2:06:58.400 --> 2:07:00.400]  He just said Lenin was horrible.
[2:07:00.400 --> 2:07:02.400]  He just said Stalin was horrible.
[2:07:02.400 --> 2:07:05.400]  He just said authoritarianism is terrible, and he wants free market,
[2:07:05.400 --> 2:07:09.400]  and he wants to work with the world, and he wants to see Ukraine be separate from Russia.
[2:07:09.400 --> 2:07:12.400]  He doesn't want to run Ukraine.
[2:07:12.400 --> 2:07:14.400]  He wants to do business with Ukraine.
[2:07:14.400 --> 2:07:17.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:07:17.400 --> 2:07:23.400]  Absa-fricking-lutely, and I don't know what else he's going to say,
[2:07:23.400 --> 2:07:25.400]  because I haven't watched it in live time.
[2:07:25.400 --> 2:07:27.400]  We've been stopping and starting it.
[2:07:27.400 --> 2:07:29.400]  We were first playing, and it was live.
[2:07:29.400 --> 2:07:31.400]  It's just incredible.
[2:07:31.400 --> 2:07:33.400]  So we'll see if he announces he's taking over the east of Ukraine,
[2:07:33.400 --> 2:07:37.400]  and that if the West attacks those people, he'll defend them,
[2:07:37.400 --> 2:07:41.400]  hopefully trying to end the war with the threat of military action by showing strength.
[2:07:41.400 --> 2:07:45.400]  But, I mean, I don't see any fault with this, and compared to other world leaders,
[2:07:45.400 --> 2:07:50.400]  I mean, he just tells the truth, and he talks about reality, being real,
[2:07:50.400 --> 2:07:55.400]  being realistic, how truth matters, how truth is what's valuable,
[2:07:55.400 --> 2:07:57.400]  and yeah, that's the only damn thing that works.
[2:07:57.400 --> 2:07:59.400]  Like, mathematics is truth.
[2:07:59.400 --> 2:08:03.400]  It lines up, or history, when you tell it accurately,
[2:08:03.400 --> 2:08:08.400]  is, you know, that's why the system claims Alex Jones lies,
[2:08:08.400 --> 2:08:10.400]  or Alex Jones is a mastermind deceptive.
[2:08:10.400 --> 2:08:13.400]  No, the truth is there's not masterminding anything.
[2:08:13.400 --> 2:08:17.400]  I just go with deep research, and then my spirit when I think's right.
[2:08:17.400 --> 2:08:19.400]  I do a lot of research, and then that's intellectual,
[2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:22.400]  but then my spirit looks at it and makes the decision.
[2:08:22.400 --> 2:08:24.400]  And this is a big deal, folks.
[2:08:24.400 --> 2:08:26.400]  This is Putin's straight shoot in the world,
[2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:28.400]  and of course, they're not going to play it on most of the channels.
[2:08:28.400 --> 2:08:32.400]  We'll take it out of context, but this is really the truth about what happened in Ukraine,
[2:08:32.400 --> 2:08:34.400]  the history of it, and the rest of it. Let's hear the rest.
[2:08:34.400 --> 2:08:43.400]  State. I'm not blaming anyone, accusing anyone of anything. The situation and the country back then and after the Civil War,
[2:08:43.400 --> 2:08:47.400]  and before the Civil War was incredibly difficult, was critical,
[2:08:47.400 --> 2:08:52.400]  and now I only can say that that's how it happened.
[2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:58.400]  That's a fact, that's a historical fact.
[2:08:58.400 --> 2:09:03.400]  And as a result of Bolshevik's policy, the Soviet Ukraine was created,
[2:09:03.400 --> 2:09:11.400]  and we have every reason to say now that it's Ukraine created by Vladimir Lenin.
[2:09:11.400 --> 2:09:20.400]  He is its creator and architect, and it's fully confirmed by the documents from the archives,
[2:09:20.400 --> 2:09:28.400]  also including Lenin's decrees regarding Donbass that was added to Ukraine,
[2:09:28.400 --> 2:09:34.400]  and now, grateful, the sentence demolishing all the statues, all the monuments to Lenin.
[2:09:34.400 --> 2:09:38.400]  They call it decommunization.
[2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:43.400]  You want decommunization? Well, we are quite happy with that.
[2:09:43.400 --> 2:09:54.400]  But don't stop halfway. We are ready to show you what would mean actual decommunization for Ukraine.
[2:09:54.400 --> 2:10:02.400]  Coming back to the history of the matter, I would like to remind you that back in 1922,
[2:10:02.400 --> 2:10:07.400]  at the territory of the former Russian Empire, the Soviet Union was established,
[2:10:07.400 --> 2:10:17.400]  but the reality showed that keeping this territory and ruling this territory using the principles of consideration
[2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:25.400]  seems impossible because it had nothing to do neither with the realities nor with the historical tradition.
[2:10:25.400 --> 2:10:32.400]  And the red terror and switch to the Stalin's purges and the monopoly of the Communist Party,
[2:10:32.400 --> 2:10:41.400]  nationalization, planned economy, all that in reality was turned into a formality, nothing more.
[2:10:41.400 --> 2:10:50.400]  Principles that were declared but didn't actually work. In reality, Soviet republics had no sovereign rights.
[2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:58.400]  None. In practice, what was created strictly centralized unitarian in its character.
[2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:08.400]  State that was centralized, Stalin implemented not Lenin's ideas, but his own ideas of how states should be built.
[2:11:08.400 --> 2:11:16.400]  But changes to the founding acts, to the constitution, he didn't make any changes in this regard.
[2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:23.400]  Lenin's principles about building the Soviet Union were not reconsidered technically.
[2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:29.400]  It seemed there was no need in this under totalitarian regime, authoritarian regime.
[2:11:29.400 --> 2:11:37.400]  Everything worked well and it looked nice from the outside. It looked more than democratic even, but still it's a shame.
[2:11:37.400 --> 2:11:47.400]  It's a shame that from the formal foundations our state was built on, they didn't clear out this audios, utopic,
[2:11:47.400 --> 2:11:52.400]  brought about by the revolution but destructive fantasies.
[2:11:52.400 --> 2:11:59.400]  And in the future, how often happened? No one thought about it.
[2:11:59.400 --> 2:12:06.400]  The leaders of the Communist Party seemed to be confident that they managed to build a strong governing system.
[2:12:06.400 --> 2:12:12.400]  That using this policy they managed to finally resolve the national issue.
[2:12:12.400 --> 2:12:20.400]  But replacing the notions, manipulating the public moods could cost dearly.
[2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:24.400]  The infection of nationalism did not disappear.
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:33.400]  And that bomb that was undermining the state with this infection of nationalism was just waiting for its hour to come.
[2:12:33.400 --> 2:12:38.400]  Because once again, any republic had the right to withdraw from the USSR.
[2:12:38.400 --> 2:12:50.400]  In the middle of 1980s, against the background of raising problems, crisis of the planned economy, the nationalist issue,
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:13:00.400]  that was cost not by some ideas of the Soviet people, but by growing appetites of the current leaders was escalated.
[2:13:00.400 --> 2:13:09.400]  But the USSR leadership, instead of analyzing the situation and making thoughtful decisions in the economy
[2:13:09.400 --> 2:13:20.400]  and in the political system, in the governing system, they were only talking about restoring Lenin's principles about national self-determination.
[2:13:20.400 --> 2:13:25.400]  More than that, inside the Communist Party there was a struggle for power.
[2:13:25.400 --> 2:13:35.400]  And each side wanting to expand its support started to encourage this nationalism.
[2:13:35.400 --> 2:13:39.400]  They were trying to play with it.
[2:13:39.400 --> 2:13:43.400]  Okay folks, so again we jump back and forth in the feed.
[2:13:43.400 --> 2:13:51.400]  And so what we're going to do is wait till he gets into the actual part about eastern Ukraine and recognizing that.
[2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:54.400]  That's the statement they already put out hours ago that he's going to announce.
[2:13:54.400 --> 2:14:01.400]  But I guess he's using this opportunity to go over some of the history of what's happened there and obviously try to get Ukraine to be its own sovereign state.
[2:14:01.400 --> 2:14:10.400]  And not a puppet of Europe and not a puppet of Russia, but an actual autonomous country that is its own.
[2:14:10.400 --> 2:14:19.400]  And he's obviously sitting there explaining that those eastern areas were given by the Soviets to Ukraine.
[2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:25.400]  And that's been part of Russia, and so you're not going to attack it and you're not going to take it, and that's what he's doing.
[2:14:25.400 --> 2:14:32.400]  And then I would imagine when we ever get there, just common sense will be, do not attack it or we'll see it as an attack on Russia.
[2:14:32.400 --> 2:14:34.400]  So they're about to absorb that region in.
[2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:37.400]  It was the same way World War I started, the same way World War II started.
[2:14:37.400 --> 2:14:45.400]  It was different European countries battling over zones and arguable areas just like cities battling each other over annexing what zones.
[2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:47.400]  It's all very interesting.
[2:14:47.400 --> 2:14:49.400]  We're going to segue away from that now.
[2:14:49.400 --> 2:14:51.400]  We basically know what's been announced, what's happened.
[2:14:51.400 --> 2:14:52.400]  There are highlights in tidbits.
[2:14:52.400 --> 2:14:55.400]  We'll give that to you here today.
[2:14:55.400 --> 2:15:08.400]  But when we come back, I'm going to go to Laura, Scott, Chris, Brian, Alan, Rick, and others here on this live Monday, February 21st broadcast.
[2:15:08.400 --> 2:15:10.400]  We've got so much other news as well.
[2:15:10.400 --> 2:15:12.400]  I haven't hit all of the COVID news.
[2:15:12.400 --> 2:15:13.400]  It is unbelievable.
[2:15:13.400 --> 2:15:15.400]  Here's just some of it.
[2:15:15.400 --> 2:15:21.400]  Report CDC has withheld COVID data from Americans to prevent vaccine hesitancy.
[2:15:21.400 --> 2:15:25.400]  Bill Gates says, sadly, Omicron has done a better job than the vaccines.
[2:15:25.400 --> 2:15:27.400]  You can't make that up.
[2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:33.400]  And so much more big broadcast lined up for you today in the last 45 minutes of this hour.
[2:15:33.400 --> 2:15:37.400]  I'm going right to your phone calls on the other side.
[2:15:37.400 --> 2:15:40.400]  And remember, we're in an information war and I appreciate all your great work.
[2:15:40.400 --> 2:15:46.400]  You don't know how powerful it is when you share the links to articles and videos from futurenews.news.
[2:15:46.400 --> 2:15:50.400]  That's the current URL that's not being censored as much that leads folks to Band-Aid video.
[2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:52.400]  Futurenews.news.
[2:15:52.400 --> 2:15:54.400]  Futurenews.news.
[2:15:54.400 --> 2:15:57.400]  Futurenews.news.
[2:15:57.400 --> 2:15:59.400]  Sold out for months.
[2:15:59.400 --> 2:16:01.400]  X3 is now back in stock.
[2:16:01.400 --> 2:16:09.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing and so many people are deficient in iodine.

[2:16:11.400 --> 2:16:13.400]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[2:16:13.400 --> 2:16:24.400]  But when you get high quality tri-iodine, all three of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly your immune system.

[2:16:41.400 --> 2:16:44.400]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.

[2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:05.400]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[2:17:05.400 --> 2:17:09.400]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[2:17:09.400 --> 2:17:15.400]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity.
[2:17:15.400 --> 2:17:17.400]  It's like we're living at a twilight zone, man.
[2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:20.400]  Alright, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[2:17:20.400 --> 2:17:24.400]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[2:17:24.400 --> 2:17:26.400]  The X3 does wonders.
[2:17:26.400 --> 2:17:31.400]  I recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it, get off the fence, get the product, support the info war.
[2:17:31.400 --> 2:17:34.400]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air, thanks for holding it, go ahead.
[2:17:34.400 --> 2:17:36.400]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you, it's an honor.
[2:17:36.400 --> 2:17:37.400]  Honor, talk to you.
[2:17:37.400 --> 2:17:44.400]  Awesome. So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products, alpha power, even at 29.
[2:17:44.400 --> 2:17:50.400]  If you ask my better half, she loves it, and it helps in the bedroom, so just number one for a few of us there.
[2:17:50.400 --> 2:17:52.400]  Well, it definitely works, it's not a joke.
[2:17:52.400 --> 2:17:53.400]  Absolutely.
[2:17:53.400 --> 2:17:56.400]  Let's move over here.
[2:18:54.400 --> 2:19:05.400]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[2:19:05.400 --> 2:19:11.400]  Info wars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[2:19:11.400 --> 2:19:18.400]  This info wars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the info war store.
[2:19:18.400 --> 2:19:25.400]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[2:19:25.400 --> 2:19:36.400]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[2:19:36.400 --> 2:19:45.400]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:51.400]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[2:19:51.400 --> 2:20:19.400]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[2:20:19.400 --> 2:20:27.400]  Alright folks, what we're going to do here as we battle the new world order is Putin is actually continuing on.
[2:20:27.400 --> 2:20:32.400]  I was wrong when I said he stopped and we're going to follow that and have all the quotes and technicals about what's happening.
[2:20:32.400 --> 2:20:35.400]  Will there be war? Will it be expanded? What's happening?
[2:20:35.400 --> 2:20:39.400]  That looks like he's doing a long history lesson here, but we're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[2:20:39.400 --> 2:20:50.400]  So as we speak, we'll have the Sputnik feed, I've noticed, has a good English translation of what he's saying in basically near live time, and we will be posting that.
[2:20:50.400 --> 2:20:57.400]  Putin declares formal recognition of Ukrainian separatist regions as sovereign states that reportedly just happened.
[2:20:57.400 --> 2:21:01.400]  So right now, let's go back or go to your phone calls now.
[2:21:01.400 --> 2:21:09.400]  Let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Pennsylvania, then we'll go to Laura in Canada. Scott, welcome.
[2:21:09.400 --> 2:21:14.400]  Hi Alex, how are you? Long time listener. It's an honor to talk to you.
[2:21:14.400 --> 2:21:16.400]  It's an honor to talk to you brother.
[2:21:16.400 --> 2:21:33.400]  Thank you. I just wanted to dovetail off the fact that the dehumanization, I feel as if it's a double edged sword simply because by putting all this demoralization out,
[2:21:33.400 --> 2:21:51.400]  I feel as if the people, it'll be more easy to see how evil our government has become unless we've gone too far and the chemical warfare has taken over so much of our minds that we literally cannot see what's being done.
[2:21:51.400 --> 2:22:05.400]  And just as, you know, it's been mentioned before, if all this evil, you know, was put forth in front of us and we choose to accept it, then, you know, we deserve it.
[2:22:05.400 --> 2:22:17.400]  Well, that's right. The geoengineering and the grooming of the children. I mean, look at how, whether it's the Boy Scouts or public schools have science camps for fifth grade elementary student girls,
[2:22:17.400 --> 2:22:29.400]  and then they send in biological men to sleep with them, and then they don't tell the parents, it's all pedophilic, it's all creepy, it's the state coming in and taking control of your children.
[2:22:29.400 --> 2:22:39.400]  It's a rape. This whole leftist movement is just raping our minds, raping our currency, raping our borders, raping our children, raping our freedom.
[2:22:39.400 --> 2:22:52.400]  And I've got the Washington Post article out today saying, freedom is bad. As he says, freedom is evil. I mean, you're like, that's cartoonish, but folks, they actually say that in headlines everywhere.
[2:22:52.400 --> 2:23:01.400]  It's ridiculous because it's so in our face, it's so blatant, so over the top that you would have to be a blind man not to see it.
[2:23:01.400 --> 2:23:07.400]  It's because they can't help it. People are like, this isn't a good move. Why do they say they wouldn't have sex with our kids? Why do they love the devil?
[2:23:07.400 --> 2:23:14.400]  Why are they saying freedom is evil? Because they're evil, folks. They're gone. They can't help it.
[2:23:14.400 --> 2:23:21.400]  God says that when you turn yourself over to evil long enough, he turns you over to a reprobate mind and you lose your soul, basically.
[2:23:21.400 --> 2:23:29.400]  You become an avatar of a demon. You become a robot of Satan. And these people, they're gone, brother. They're gone.
[2:23:29.400 --> 2:23:35.400]  And I just, I pray every night, and I pray that God protect you, Alex, and the rest of the Info Wars crew and every other...
[2:23:35.400 --> 2:23:41.400]  I know you're praying for me and I need it, brother, because our mission is important and also be selfish and say, I don't want to get killed or put in prison.
[2:23:41.400 --> 2:23:44.400]  But yes, will you promise to keep praying for Info Wars, brother?
[2:23:44.400 --> 2:23:45.400]  Yes, sir.
[2:23:45.400 --> 2:23:51.400]  I love you and I appreciate you, Scott. Thank you so much. I love all of you, folks. I love you so much.
[2:23:51.400 --> 2:23:55.400]  Laura in Canada. Laura, thank you for calling.
[2:23:55.400 --> 2:23:59.400]  Hi, Alex. Thank you so much for taking my phone call.
[2:23:59.400 --> 2:24:07.400]  I'm calling, actually, I live in Ontario and I broadcast with a larger network out in New Orleans, Louisiana with my own show, United Public Radio Network.
[2:24:07.400 --> 2:24:13.400]  I share that because I get a lot of stuff done to me, like we do when people follow our shows from all over the world.
[2:24:13.400 --> 2:24:15.400]  Yeah, you have a lot of contacts.
[2:24:15.400 --> 2:24:20.400]  Yeah, so I watch them hearing from Australia all over the world. Thanks. They get raped from the people.
[2:24:20.400 --> 2:24:27.400]  But what I'm going to say is, you know, I'm also a nurse of critical care experience and I watched live when that grandmother,
[2:24:27.400 --> 2:24:36.400]  who is also a clan mother in First Nations person, like I had a First Nations, basically, being a clan mother.
[2:24:36.400 --> 2:24:41.400]  What happened? And I can't even begin to describe the horror.
[2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:44.400]  And I've seen some awful stuff being a critical care nurse.
[2:24:44.400 --> 2:24:52.400]  Yep. In fact, guys, while she's talking, roll that footage of the woman on the walker, the woman on the mobility scooter being trampled by the Clydesdale.
[2:24:52.400 --> 2:24:58.400]  Yeah, I saw more of the footage too. She has a bunch of broken ribs. She could die. And the media is making jokes about her.
[2:24:58.400 --> 2:25:00.400]  What did you make of that?
[2:25:00.400 --> 2:25:05.400]  You know what? I don't cry easily. I was in tears.
[2:25:05.400 --> 2:25:09.400]  Like I said, I've seen horrible things and I was traumatized.
[2:25:09.400 --> 2:25:18.400]  I got sent a video this morning from a couple trying to go down to downtown Ottawa to get some breakfast and the police stopping them.
[2:25:18.400 --> 2:25:28.400]  She started on videos saying to them, you people, you're doing all this illegal stuff. You're not coming down here. It's all blocked off the road.
[2:25:28.400 --> 2:25:33.400]  Oh, I love the comments on Twitter, like half of them are like, that old bitch deserves to die. Should have followed orders.
[2:25:33.400 --> 2:25:41.400]  What has happened to these people? Because there's one thing the cops doing that's bad enough that the left celebrating trampling people with horses.
[2:25:41.400 --> 2:25:54.400]  Well, now, Christia Freeland is calling for us to keep these war measures laws. And she actually said in a live broadcast that we should be now freezing the funds of those that support Trump.
[2:25:54.400 --> 2:26:01.400]  I saw that. They're going to take as much power as they can get. Can you believe how naked they are now?
[2:26:01.400 --> 2:26:10.400]  Well, they are. But what my concern is, and people may, you probably have seen this, but there has been sort of an anonymous video that was on TikTok.
[2:26:10.400 --> 2:26:18.400]  A gentleman that is a trucker trying to hit his identity, calling for all truckers to drop their loads starting today and don't bring anything else.
[2:26:18.400 --> 2:26:26.400]  They've warned Canadians to go out and get their supplies because it won't take long for the shelves to empty. It's a holiday today.
[2:26:26.400 --> 2:26:33.400]  How crazy is this? It's supposed to be family day today after everything that's been going on in our country.
[2:26:33.400 --> 2:26:43.400]  Well, Canada is hardworking people and nice people like Midwesterns in America or Southerners on average, whether they're black, white, Hispanic or such nice people.
[2:26:43.400 --> 2:26:51.400]  And they thought you were wimps, so they chose you as the target because they thought you'd roll over, but you didn't roll over.
[2:26:51.400 --> 2:26:57.400]  And now they're so angry at you and all they've done is awaken the sleeping giant.
[2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:05.400]  And I know that more truckers are coming, more people are coming, and I know there's huge marches of hundreds of thousands in other Canadian cities,
[2:27:05.400 --> 2:27:09.400]  and that's got to really scare the system. What are you saying?
[2:27:09.400 --> 2:27:20.400]  Well, you know what? Where I live, I'm right smack dab in the middle of Canada. So you have to come through my city to go from either side of Canada if you're crossing or down to Southern Ontario.
[2:27:20.400 --> 2:27:25.400]  So there are more truckers. We've heard them. We're very close to the intersecting highways in my city.
[2:27:25.400 --> 2:27:30.400]  So they're coming, but what's his next move? I mean, and you know, people that are...
[2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:33.400]  And by the way, that's the big story is there's truckers from all over Canada.
[2:27:33.400 --> 2:27:37.400]  Now, when they started seeing them beat people up three days ago, that triggered them to come.
[2:27:37.400 --> 2:27:45.400]  What's going to happen when a few thousand thug cops, because most cops wouldn't be part of it, they surveyed police nationwide, as you know, who would come and do evil.
[2:27:45.400 --> 2:27:51.400]  What are those two thousand thugs going to do when now another hundred thousand truckers show up to respond to their evil?
[2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:59.400]  And nobody wants to be violent. Okay, this is... And you know what? We know why they did this, because they were hoping people would retaliate.
[2:27:59.400 --> 2:28:07.400]  They're fighting back. I saw right away when I saw the green uniforms, I knew they weren't from Canada right away. I heard your report, by the way.
[2:28:07.400 --> 2:28:09.400]  Oh, yeah. Do you see all the U.N. aircraft landing?
[2:28:09.400 --> 2:28:21.400]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, when you were doing a newscast about Southern California, that the 4,000 plus police were set to lose their jobs unless they agreed to come up to Canada.
[2:28:21.400 --> 2:28:26.400]  Now, we love you guys. You are brothers and sisters. We pray for you, just like we know.
[2:28:26.400 --> 2:28:33.400]  The one thing about this, Alex, that we have to say, like you said, it's awakened the sleeping lion, but it has united the world.
[2:28:33.400 --> 2:28:42.400]  It's made people realize we're not alone. We're united in humanity. Yeah, you're going to get people out there, like they'll ask and people that...
[2:28:42.400 --> 2:28:45.400]  Laura, that's awesome. How do people find your show?
[2:28:45.400 --> 2:28:53.400]  It is tonight, actually, on United Public Radio Network. It's called the Angel Rock, and I am broadcasting from 10 p.m. to...
[2:28:53.400 --> 2:28:57.400]  Beautiful. Thank you so much. More calls straight ahead.
[2:28:57.400 --> 2:29:05.400]  I've been on air more than 25 years, and long before I started selling high-quality vitamin D3 eight years ago,
[2:29:05.400 --> 2:29:11.400]  I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[2:29:11.400 --> 2:29:16.400]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're black or white or Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[2:29:16.400 --> 2:29:21.400]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that are out there.
[2:29:21.400 --> 2:29:28.400]  It's just like you need oxygen. You die in four minutes without oxygen. You die in five or six days without water. You die in a month without food.
[2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:34.400]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that you need.
[2:29:34.400 --> 2:29:39.400]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D3.

[2:31:10.400 --> 2:31:23.400]  For permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their laws. But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers,
[2:31:23.400 --> 2:31:31.400]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[2:31:31.400 --> 2:31:39.400]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever. The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[2:31:39.400 --> 2:31:48.400]  Like Canada, where they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[2:31:48.400 --> 2:32:03.400]  So pray for these folks big time. It's a very serious situation. Stay tuned into infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[2:32:19.400 --> 2:32:26.400]  That's why they launched their great reset and their program after collapsing us of build back better.
[2:32:26.400 --> 2:32:36.400]  This is nothing more than a top down vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left,
[2:32:36.400 --> 2:32:43.400]  which is the ideology of this world government system couldn't win. They released a biological weapon on us.
[2:32:43.400 --> 2:32:51.400]  Now we know two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago. It's that simple. They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns.
[2:32:51.400 --> 2:32:55.400]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[2:32:55.400 --> 2:33:16.400]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[2:33:16.400 --> 2:33:29.400]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:29.400 --> 2:33:40.400]  I've always admired China's basic dictatorship and now Trudeau and others are announcing a permanent civil emergency.
[2:33:40.400 --> 2:33:47.400]  Putin is going in hard on Ukraine with the rhetoric referring to Ukraine's process of decommunization.
[2:33:47.400 --> 2:33:52.400]  You want to decommunize? Well, we are fine with that, but let's not stop that way.
[2:33:52.400 --> 2:34:01.400]  We're ready to show you what real decommunization is like for Ukraine.
[2:34:01.400 --> 2:34:14.400]  And then he goes on to say, I am decommunizing Russia. But the hard line right wingers here so brainwashed that Russia was our enemy for their lifetimes.
[2:34:14.400 --> 2:34:26.400]  Say, oh, it's a secret plot. They're still in bed with them. No, the Larry Finks and Black Rocks and globalist organizations hate Russia's guts because Russia is not under their control.
[2:34:26.400 --> 2:34:31.400]  It doesn't mean Russia's perfect, but it means the globalists are not in control of it and they can't stand it.
[2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:41.400]  Let's move quickly through your amazing phone calls, trying to give each caller a minute or two so we get to everybody who's been holding the longest here.
[2:34:41.400 --> 2:34:49.400]  I guess that would be Chris and then Rick. Chris in Michigan, right up there where all this is going on by Canada.
[2:34:49.400 --> 2:34:52.400]  Chris, what's your view on the situation?
[2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:58.400]  I really just don't have a view. I really don't know what to do about it all.
[2:34:58.400 --> 2:35:05.400]  I was going to call and ask you basically what I mean, everybody be at peaceful. I think that's the way it should be handled and everything.
[2:35:05.400 --> 2:35:12.400]  But what's our next move once they bust your teeth down your throat and running run old ladies over with horses and all that.
[2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:20.400]  Well, I mean, I hear you. The globalists want us to kill the cops and then they start civil war and then they sit back and watch the stocks plunge and they come in and buy them up cheap.
[2:35:20.400 --> 2:35:28.400]  I want to identify Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, the people running this and then have everybody sue them, elect leaders that will then go after them.
[2:35:28.400 --> 2:35:37.400]  Because if they just trigger a civil war and we don't involve ourselves, then their globalist system will fall.
[2:35:37.400 --> 2:35:45.400]  They're hoping they can turn up the heat, have an explosion and then bring in a permanent tyranny and we forget about how we got in that tyranny.
[2:35:45.400 --> 2:35:57.400]  So, yeah, it's very shameful to have the special police and I say special, the average cops wouldn't do it, that they brought into Canada to attack men, women and children and do all of this.
[2:35:57.400 --> 2:36:08.400]  They found their order followers and I really think they'll stage a false flag soon to demonize the protesters because without that they have really screwed themselves over.
[2:36:08.400 --> 2:36:16.400]  Trudeau was only elected with 30% of the vote, again, by a parliamentary trick. He's, they're saying maybe he has 15% of approval rating right now.
[2:36:16.400 --> 2:36:23.400]  So he's a total minion. That's why when he tries to shake Xi Jinping's hand or Bolsonaro's hand.
[2:36:23.400 --> 2:36:28.400]  Bolsonaro is a great Christian patriot as good as you could get in my view.
[2:36:28.400 --> 2:36:41.400]  Xi Jinping's a super evil communist, but there's famous video where he tries to talk to both of them and tries to shake their hands and they know he's owned by the UN and Klaus Schwab and Black Rock.
[2:36:41.400 --> 2:36:46.400]  And they're like, and that's how the Chinese are especially. If they know you're already somebody's puppet, they don't meet with you.
[2:36:46.400 --> 2:36:51.400]  They meet with the boss. Say they're with Bolsonaro. Go ahead and roll the footage again.
[2:36:51.400 --> 2:36:57.400]  And so he tries to talk to Xi Jinping. Xi Jinping won't talk to him. He tries to talk to Bolsonaro.
[2:36:57.400 --> 2:37:04.400]  Bolsonaro won't talk to him. And that's because they know he's a puppet.
[2:37:04.400 --> 2:37:10.400]  Roll that footage again. I'm glad you were able to pull that up so quick because, because that perfectly illustrates.
[2:37:10.400 --> 2:37:15.400]  Yeah, back up to the beginning because he comes over and sits down. Yeah, here it is.
[2:37:15.400 --> 2:37:20.400]  Try to talk to Xi Jinping. He won't talk to him. Touches his leg won't. Okay, nobody's talking to me.
[2:37:20.400 --> 2:37:23.400]  Well, let me, let me talk to Bolsonaro.
[2:37:23.400 --> 2:37:28.400]  So you got the right wing Christian on the one hand, the communists on the other, but they both run their countries.
[2:37:28.400 --> 2:37:36.400]  Oh, no, I'm not talking to a puppet. You're bought and paid for son. We don't talk and it happens everywhere he goes.
[2:37:36.400 --> 2:37:44.400]  Trump wouldn't talk to him because no one respects a puppet. No one wants to be a puppet.
[2:37:44.400 --> 2:38:00.400]  You've had all the Brian Stelters in the world and left us jockeying to be in positions of power and to get under CNN and get under ABC or get under NBC when they have dwindling audiences of idiots and everybody else hates them.
[2:38:00.400 --> 2:38:12.400]  It's joining a sinking ship, but they, they always aspire to that. They always believe that. And so they can't stop being a trailblazer is what you want.
[2:38:12.400 --> 2:38:22.400]  Being a maverick is what you want. Being a leader that stands up to the people. That's what's timeless. That's what honors your ancestors and your family and your project to come.
[2:38:22.400 --> 2:38:33.400]  That's what makes us strong. Our strength is people like Bolsonaro. Our strength is people like George Washington. Our strength is people that stand up for what's right.
[2:38:33.400 --> 2:38:42.400]  People like Martin Luther King Jr. That's our strength, not bowing, not groveling. Everything we got was because of free society standing up.
[2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:48.400]  In fact, one of the crew pointed out that I should call somebody out and I'll do it at the start of the next segment.
[2:38:48.400 --> 2:38:55.400]  And that's Drake, who I think he's got great music. By the way, I love his music out of hip hop and rap. I think he's one of the best talented people out there.
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:39:03.400]  It was to him all the time, but the point is, is that what's he doing with people in Canada? He's all this rebel and this outsider and all the stuff.
[2:39:03.400 --> 2:39:14.400]  He's not doing other because he's being a bitch to his record label and the establishment just like that other dumb ass Canadian up there who's been trying to make us all take the shots.
[2:39:14.400 --> 2:39:22.400]  And once Joe Rogan taken off Spotify, we all know his name. I don't even need to say it. Yeah, keep on rocking in the free world.
[2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:27.400]  All right. So let's go to Chris and Michigan. Chris, go ahead.
[2:39:27.400 --> 2:39:29.400]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[2:39:29.400 --> 2:39:33.400]  Yeah, you were there. You asked a question. I think I mean, did I answer it for you?
[2:39:33.400 --> 2:39:39.400]  You did. I'd also like to kill a thousand of those cops that make the enemy more powerful.
[2:39:39.400 --> 2:39:44.400]  Well, you know, that's the thing. I just I'm so tired of taking a back seat and just sitting down.
[2:39:44.400 --> 2:39:48.400]  No, I know. So don't comply with the system. Expose the system. Wake people up.
[2:39:48.400 --> 2:39:52.400]  Say no to it at every level. And don't worry if things keep deteriorating.
[2:39:52.400 --> 2:39:56.400]  Claw Swab gets a civil war. You're going to get every chance you want.
[2:39:56.400 --> 2:39:59.400]  It'll all be a bit crazy free for all. It won't matter anymore what's going on.
[2:39:59.400 --> 2:40:03.400]  You'll all be animated. We'll be jumping around like gorillas killing each other.
[2:40:03.400 --> 2:40:10.400]  And we're so close. And hey, once we go into that game, I'm pretty sure all shed my skin and be a horrible creature.
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:13.400]  But the point is, no, not me folks, but I know how to.
[2:40:13.400 --> 2:40:20.400]  The point is, is we want to stop that. We want to intellectually beat our enemies. Our enemies want a physical conflict because why?
[2:40:20.400 --> 2:40:24.400]  They're losing the hearts and minds. Does that make sense?
[2:40:24.400 --> 2:40:33.400]  Yes. Yes, it does. Hey, I want to give a shout out to your survival X, X to shield X to the ultimate fish oil,
[2:40:33.400 --> 2:40:38.400]  the super male vitality, the bodies and the fiber green cast that take them every day.
[2:40:38.400 --> 2:40:43.400]  They're the good stuff. You all get out there and get them for yourself and your family. You need them.
[2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:44.400]  Thanks, Alex. Have a good rest.
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:47.400]  Hey, brother, I appreciate you and your question is so important because I agree with you.
[2:40:47.400 --> 2:40:53.400]  When I watched them beat up old ladies and knock people's teeth out and beat them with guns at a primitive level a thousand years ago,
[2:40:53.400 --> 2:40:57.400]  500 years ago, we'd have a George Washington pop up and we'd go kick their ass.
[2:40:57.400 --> 2:41:02.400]  They wouldn't act like that anymore. But you understand we got a bunch of brainwashed public doesn't know what's going on.
[2:41:02.400 --> 2:41:04.400]  And so we've got to wake them up ahead of that.
[2:41:04.400 --> 2:41:11.400]  You understand they lose when they beat us with billy clubs and run over women with with with with horses.
[2:41:11.400 --> 2:41:17.400]  If we don't attack back, not because we're wimps, but because we realize these guys are just puppets.
[2:41:17.400 --> 2:41:23.400]  We want to burn the leaders that gave the orders who think we'll be dumb and kill the cops and then they win the game.
[2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:28.400]  You understand? God bless you.
[2:41:28.400 --> 2:41:34.400]  All right, I'm going to go to break. I'm going to come back with that challenge to Drake and then we're going to go right back to your phone calls
[2:41:34.400 --> 2:41:37.400]  and I'll finish up. I'm sure so until let me still 15 minutes of his great show.

[2:41:52.400 --> 2:41:55.400]  Please fund me and keep me on air.
[2:41:55.400 --> 2:42:00.400]  Part of me just wants to go run off in the woods and say, Hey, man, imagine if Alex Jones just disappeared.
[2:42:00.400 --> 2:42:06.400]  Like, Hey, I done my thing. I did my tour 28 years. I'm out of here, but I can't do that.
[2:42:06.400 --> 2:42:09.400]  But then they can take me off air.

Can I plug Alex real quick? Hey, I'm in my 60s and I did the work of 25 30 year olds and I worked them into the ground and you wanted to why and I've tested this and I've taken your B 12 and let me tell you when I don't take it.
[2:44:28.400 --> 2:44:44.400]  I pay a price. I really do. I take that B 12 and I'm electric man. I can run 10 miles. I did some pretty heavy work with a highway department and my friends will attest to the fact that yeah, for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70.
[2:44:44.400 --> 2:44:59.400]  I mean, I know I'm not just blowing smoke here. The B 12 saves my life.
[2:44:59.400 --> 2:45:15.400]  They're here all over the world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their facilities and they're
[2:45:15.400 --> 2:45:32.400]  planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant,
[2:45:32.400 --> 2:45:48.400]  meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarstore.com. We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.

[2:45:58.400 --> 2:46:09.400]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training, probably not as much as I should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarstore.com.
[2:46:09.400 --> 2:46:23.400]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some Turbo Force to give me that energy I need to get going. You know, besides the energy Turbo Force, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins,
[2:46:23.400 --> 2:46:34.400]  plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training. And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilus. I have bad joints. Thanks, mom.

[2:47:15.400 --> 2:47:34.400]  Working on a weekend like usual, way off in the deep end like usual, swear they passed us, they doing too much, haven't done my taxes, I'm too turned up, Virgil got a paddock on my wrist going nuts,
[2:47:34.400 --> 2:47:48.400]  call me slipping once okay so what, someone hit your block up, I tell you if it was us, man a house in Rosewood, it too plush, say my days a number but I keep waking up, no you see my text baby please say something,
[2:47:48.400 --> 2:48:06.400]  wine by the glass, man a cheapskate huh, gotta move off my release, stay home, this is fame, not clout, I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth, baby got an ego twice the size of the crib, I can never tell if it is what it is,
[2:48:06.400 --> 2:48:18.400]  said what I had to and did what I did, never turned my back on every cheek I forbid, Virgil got a paddock on my wrist doing front flips, giving you my number but don't hit me on the gun,
[2:48:18.400 --> 2:48:32.400]  working on a weekend like usual, way off in the deep end like usual, swear they passed us, they doing too much, haven't done my taxes, I'm too turned up, Virgil got a paddock on my wrist going nuts,
[2:48:32.400 --> 2:48:42.400]  so Drake says he's against police brutality, that's good, I'm against it too, Drake says he's a big Canadian up there in Toronto, where is Drake?
[2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:58.400]  Right now about what's been going on for four weeks in Canada over two years of tyranny, seriously because you got Kanye West over there who I admire because he's got a lot of courage and has been demonizing attack for the truth, he's not perfect, I'm not perfect either,
[2:48:58.400 --> 2:49:12.400]  and then you got people, you got ice tea coming out against gun control in the new world order, that's good, these are powerful important people that reach a lot of folks,
[2:49:12.400 --> 2:49:22.400]  I mean I say people over about 50 don't listen to it but I've been listening to it since I was a kid, everybody below me listens to it, all these old white people, I think the Beatles are still popular,
[2:49:22.400 --> 2:49:35.400]  but I mean these are the Beatles of today and where are they? Oh you're all tough, you're all gangster, you're all with the people, well let's see it, let's see it Drake,
[2:49:35.400 --> 2:49:49.400]  because what's going on in Canada and everywhere else is BS, no but you don't see Snoop Dogg against this, he loves it, he's at the Super Bowl, you're all sold out to the system and you're a joke,
[2:49:49.400 --> 2:50:01.400]  and that's all I can say is your managers tell you don't get involved, just sit there and clutch your money, if you don't have a free society to spin your money in,
[2:50:01.400 --> 2:50:10.400]  or you're in a nuclear war Drake, it's not worth anything, you know and Joe Rogan's a great guy, I've known Joe Rogan 23 years, longer than that, 23 years,
[2:50:10.400 --> 2:50:19.400]  and I always knew Joe was a great guy and then I saw him about four years ago going with the system and I got in his face and said you're wrong,
[2:50:19.400 --> 2:50:29.400]  and then Joe went for the truth the last few years because he finally realized it was true and what happened to Joe? Well I know the inside baseball, I told you he didn't make $100 million last year,
[2:50:29.400 --> 2:50:37.400]  he didn't make $200 million last year because he started talking about the truth, Joe found out about how big the truth is, Joe made a lot more than that,
[2:50:37.400 --> 2:50:45.400]  it's not about that money, that's just numbers, that's just symbols, the truth is what really matters, but now you see where we are,
[2:50:45.400 --> 2:50:57.400]  and you see Joe on the great reset, you see Joe on the new world order, and I just wonder who's been feeding him all that information,
[2:50:57.400 --> 2:51:10.400]  because real mastery comes when you're there way before anybody else does it and then you just step back once you've completed the mission and watch everybody else carry out the victory,
[2:51:10.400 --> 2:51:17.400]  and that's really what I want to do, but we're far from that victory at this point,
[2:51:17.400 --> 2:51:27.400]  but this crew and this operation and the listeners, you deserve the credit, I know you're not looking for the credit, but I need to tell you how you get the credit,
[2:51:27.400 --> 2:51:36.400]  because you need to recognize how you change the world and how we're on a fighting foot right now and actually are winning,
[2:51:36.400 --> 2:51:51.400]  in a fight, they're 45, we're 55, or a football game, we're 36, they're 30, we're 33, they're 27, I mean we're right there folks,
[2:51:51.400 --> 2:51:59.400]  we're in the game, we're in the lead actually right now, and if we just get in the zone and pray to God,
[2:51:59.400 --> 2:52:09.400]  that's how you get in the zone and just don't care about what happens to our bodies, and we tell the truth, we're going to win and secure the next big push for our species in the future,
[2:52:09.400 --> 2:52:17.400]  and our children that are counting on us to man up and stand up and be strong and win,
[2:52:17.400 --> 2:52:25.400]  and I get all your genetic memory is, you get told to go kill some people, you're in a war, other soldiers show up, you kill them, you win,
[2:52:25.400 --> 2:52:34.400]  you secure the future for your women and children, well this is next level, now you got to secure businesses, you got to secure information,
[2:52:34.400 --> 2:52:42.400]  you got to become informed, you got to secure leadership, and then if all that fails, we'll resort to the good old fashioned killing,
[2:52:42.400 --> 2:52:47.400]  and I think you're going to find something men that are looking to be men out there, when you start taking care of your kids,
[2:52:47.400 --> 2:52:53.400]  you start working hard, if you're looking to be a badass, if you're looking to be a killer, all of a sudden all these systems open up,
[2:52:53.400 --> 2:53:00.400]  and now you're the killer you always wanted to be, except you don't want to be a killer anymore, you want to be a farmer,
[2:53:00.400 --> 2:53:14.400]  you want to be a builder, you want to be somebody that brings the species forward, and that desire of human destiny is spreading now across the world,
[2:53:14.400 --> 2:53:21.400]  and our influence far pierces beyond the major leaders we've affected here in the United States.
[2:53:21.400 --> 2:53:30.400]  Our collective will of this broadcast, you, your will, your prayer, your force of your voice, that's what incantation means,
[2:53:30.400 --> 2:53:36.400]  think of an incantation as some witch, well they have their incantations, we have ours, you pray to God that's an incantation,
[2:53:36.400 --> 2:53:43.400]  when you speak out for the truth it's an incantation, it's the will of your voice like God spoke reality into existence,
[2:53:43.400 --> 2:53:51.400]  we are little G and made the image of God, we speak it into existence now, and we have spoken the pro-human future into existence,
[2:53:51.400 --> 2:54:01.400]  we have spoken the intergalactic, interstellar, interdimensional existence into existence, we have already flipped the switch,
[2:54:01.400 --> 2:54:10.400]  we have already through God's promise ensured the survival of the species and next level development.
[2:54:10.400 --> 2:54:18.400]  The question is, how many people do we take with us, how many souls join us into the next level on how many fall to the enemy,
[2:54:18.400 --> 2:54:26.400]  those are precious souls that are literally going to be captured in the phantom zone with Satan for very long cycles,
[2:54:26.400 --> 2:54:35.400]  we've got to try to take as many of them with us as we can, and Hollywood knows this, and the whole satanic culture knows this,
[2:54:35.400 --> 2:54:40.400]  that's why they have movies like Poltergeist, where the cult leader takes them out in the Arizona desert
[2:54:40.400 --> 2:54:45.400]  and kills everybody to get their souls to take their spirits with them as he's even possessed,
[2:54:45.400 --> 2:54:57.400]  and he's trying to manipulate the little girl to get her spirit into the dimension to fool all those spirits to follow him into hell.
[2:54:57.400 --> 2:55:09.400]  And of course they raped that little girl to death on the set of that movie, on the next movie, that's Hollywood for you.
[2:55:09.400 --> 2:55:12.400]  So what does that song say from the High Woman?
[2:55:12.400 --> 2:55:20.400]  I'm going to live forever, I'm going to cross that river, I'm going to reach tomorrow now, don't let the darkness take them,
[2:55:20.400 --> 2:55:30.400]  don't let them feel forsaken, because even though we'll play the song and come back with your calls, even though they're not forsaken, they feel forsaken.
[2:55:30.400 --> 2:55:33.400]  Now go ahead and play the song out to break it's important.
[2:55:33.400 --> 2:55:52.400]  I'm going to live forever, I'm going to cross that river, I'm going to catch tomorrow now, you're gonna want to hold me just like I always told you,
[2:55:52.400 --> 2:56:10.400]  you're gonna miss me when I'm gone, nobody here will ever find me, but I will always be around, just like the songs I leave behind me.
[2:56:10.400 --> 2:56:25.400]  I'm gonna live forever now, that's what you want folks, good stuff, just thank God you're not, thank God you're not.
[2:56:25.400 --> 2:56:29.600]  Don't let the darkness take them, don't make them feel forsaken, just lean safely to the
[2:56:29.600 --> 2:56:31.600]  Please try to raise more Tridon.
[2:56:34.100 --> 2:56:36.100]  Don't let the darkness take him.
[2:56:36.100 --> 2:56:38.100]  Don't make him feel forsaken.
[2:56:38.100 --> 2:56:41.100]  Just lead him safely to the light.
[2:56:43.100 --> 2:56:46.100]  When the whole world is blown asunder
[2:56:47.600 --> 2:56:50.100]  And all the stars fall from the sky
[2:56:52.100 --> 2:56:55.100]  Remember someone really loves you
[2:56:55.100 --> 2:56:59.100]  We'll live forever you and I
[2:56:59.100 --> 2:57:05.100]  You see, interdimensionally love, admiration, commitment
[2:57:05.100 --> 2:57:09.100]  It's the most powerful energy in the universe
[2:57:10.100 --> 2:57:14.100]  It transcends all time, all dimensions
[2:57:15.100 --> 2:57:20.100]  And it's what the enemies of humanity hate more than anything
[2:57:20.100 --> 2:57:23.100]  We're gonna go to break and I promise get to all the collars
[2:57:23.100 --> 2:57:28.100]  Eric and Alan and others that are patiently holding
[2:57:28.100 --> 2:57:32.100]  In hour number four that Gerald Salente takes over
[2:57:32.100 --> 2:57:35.100]  I love how the tyrannical attacks
[2:57:35.100 --> 2:57:37.100]  of these men, women, and children in Ottawa
[2:57:37.100 --> 2:57:39.100]  has now spurred the rebellion worldwide
[2:57:40.100 --> 2:57:42.100]  We'll be right back, stay with us
[2:57:42.100 --> 2:57:44.100]  I'm gonna catch tomorrow now
[2:57:47.100 --> 2:57:52.100]  Two life-changing, life-empowering products
[2:57:52.100 --> 2:57:55.100]  are now back in stock after being sold out for months
[2:57:55.100 --> 2:57:57.100]  at infowarstore.com
[2:57:57.100 --> 2:58:00.100]  Winter Sun is the highest quality organic vitamin D3
[2:58:00.100 --> 2:58:03.100]  Taken under the tongue, it also has vitamin K
[2:58:03.100 --> 2:58:05.100]  Critical fear immune system and so much more

[2:58:11.100 --> 2:58:13.100]  Old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter
[2:58:13.100 --> 2:58:15.100]  You need what's in Winter Sun and then
[2:58:15.100 --> 2:58:17.100]  We have Brain Force Ultra
[2:58:17.100 --> 2:58:22.100]  Super fast acting, amazing, clean, neutropic system
[2:58:22.100 --> 2:58:25.100]  that is a compliment to Brain Force Plus
[2:58:25.100 --> 2:58:27.100]  and of course Turbo Force
[2:58:27.100 --> 2:58:29.100]  All three of these are different formulas
[2:58:29.100 --> 2:58:31.100]  but all three of them take your mind
[2:58:31.100 --> 2:58:34.100]  and take your focus and clarity and alert us to the next level
[2:58:34.100 --> 2:58:39.100]  It is 40% off at infowarstore.com for a limited time
[2:58:39.100 --> 2:58:41.100]  Thank you all for your support
[2:58:41.100 --> 2:58:43.100]  If you haven't tried these products, you really need to
[2:58:43.100 --> 2:58:44.100]  because they are amazing
[2:58:44.100 --> 2:58:47.100]  at infowarstore.com
[2:59:14.100 --> 2:59:17.100]  I'm impressed by the voices of good people all around the world
[2:59:17.100 --> 2:59:20.100]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[2:59:20.100 --> 2:59:23.100]  that are exposing all their lives
[2:59:23.100 --> 2:59:26.100]  their COVID hysteria, their world's gonna end in 2030
[2:59:26.100 --> 2:59:29.100]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it
[2:59:29.100 --> 2:59:31.100]  and none of it can succeed
[2:59:31.100 --> 2:59:33.100]  None of it can actually be carried out
[2:59:33.100 --> 2:59:36.100]  unless everybody is silenced and gas lit
[2:59:36.100 --> 2:59:39.100]  and that's why truth comes with hard work
[2:59:39.100 --> 2:59:41.100]  and with research and with diligence
[2:59:41.100 --> 2:59:44.100]  that's why it's hard to share info wars links
[2:59:44.100 --> 2:59:45.100]  and band up video links
[2:59:45.100 --> 2:59:47.100]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever
[2:59:50.100 --> 2:59:53.100]  If you are receiving this transmission
[2:59:53.100 --> 2:59:55.100]  you are the resistance
[2:59:55.100 --> 3:00:11.100]  I don't want to set the world on fire
[3:00:11.100 --> 3:00:19.100]  I just want to start a flame in your heart
[3:00:19.100 --> 3:00:21.100]  Well the last thing
[3:00:21.100 --> 3:00:25.100]  Putin said today in the speech, Owen will be covering it come up in an hour
[3:00:25.100 --> 3:00:28.100]  U.S. deployment of some weapons in Ukraine will mean
[3:00:28.100 --> 3:00:30.100]  they put a knife to Russia's throat
[3:00:30.100 --> 3:00:32.100]  and he said we'll go ahead
[3:00:32.100 --> 3:00:34.100]  recognize what was part of Russia forever
[3:00:34.100 --> 3:00:36.100]  Eastern Ukraine, a small area of that
[3:00:36.100 --> 3:00:38.100]  and if they don't like it, I guess he'll invade
[3:00:38.100 --> 3:00:40.100]  that is where we're at right now
[3:00:40.100 --> 3:00:43.100]  Let's go to your phone calls after my bout of preaching earlier
[3:00:43.100 --> 3:00:45.100]  Let's go to Rick in California
[3:00:45.100 --> 3:00:47.100]  You're on the air, thank you Rick
[3:00:47.100 --> 3:00:53.100]  Yeah, go ahead
[3:00:53.100 --> 3:00:57.100]  Yes, thank you, we are at info war
[3:00:57.100 --> 3:00:59.100]  What's on your mind brother?
[3:00:59.100 --> 3:01:03.100]  Okay, so I just want to let you know man
[3:01:03.100 --> 3:01:05.100]  we're ready to go out here
[3:01:05.100 --> 3:01:10.100]  I really think that everything's come full fledged
[3:01:10.100 --> 3:01:15.100]  What needs to happen to take back our freedom
[3:01:15.100 --> 3:01:17.100]  You know, things are going to get kinetic
[3:01:17.100 --> 3:01:21.100]  I don't think, from my forecast, I don't see anything
[3:01:21.100 --> 3:01:23.100]  getting better over here
[3:01:23.100 --> 3:01:27.100]  These people, you've hit it on the head all day long
[3:01:27.100 --> 3:01:29.100]  They don't know how to farm
[3:01:29.100 --> 3:01:32.100]  They don't know how to do a whole lot of anything
[3:01:32.100 --> 3:01:34.100]  to where what they're going to pull out of there
[3:01:34.100 --> 3:01:38.100]  to fix these problems is going to be far slim
[3:01:38.100 --> 3:01:40.100]  to no solution
[3:01:40.100 --> 3:01:43.100]  So I just want to say we're ready
[3:01:43.100 --> 3:01:45.100]  We're ready to take back our freedom
[3:01:45.100 --> 3:01:49.100]  Canada just sparked up a big storm here in America
[3:01:49.100 --> 3:01:53.100]  I'm telling you, these people, they drake
[3:01:53.100 --> 3:01:56.100]  Whoever these people are, they're hiding in the hills
[3:01:56.100 --> 3:01:59.100]  The fight's coming to them, they're front door real soon
[3:01:59.100 --> 3:02:01.100]  There's not going to be anyone to save them
[3:02:01.100 --> 3:02:03.100]  There's not going to be anyone to save them
[3:02:03.100 --> 3:02:05.100]  They said they fund the police
[3:02:05.100 --> 3:02:07.100]  Well they guess what, the police are on our side
[3:02:07.100 --> 3:02:10.100]  We the people, they haven't forgot who the people
[3:02:10.100 --> 3:02:12.100]  who turned the backs off
[3:02:12.100 --> 3:02:14.100]  So guess what, they're still in the neighborhood
[3:02:14.100 --> 3:02:17.100]  They may not have been a job right now, active
[3:02:17.100 --> 3:02:19.100]  But guess what, we're ready
[3:02:19.100 --> 3:02:20.100]  Everybody's ready
[3:02:20.100 --> 3:02:22.100]  And until that push comes to shove
[3:02:22.100 --> 3:02:24.100]  Let's get kinetic, let's do it
[3:02:24.100 --> 3:02:26.100]  I hear you brother, that's why Klaus Schwab and them
[3:02:26.100 --> 3:02:28.100]  thought they would cause a civil war
[3:02:28.100 --> 3:02:30.100]  and then we would never blame them
[3:02:30.100 --> 3:02:32.100]  No, we blame the globalist, we blame the leadership
[3:02:32.100 --> 3:02:34.100]  the Democrat and Republican Party
[3:02:34.100 --> 3:02:36.100]  and they need to know that
[3:02:36.100 --> 3:02:38.100]  God bless you, thanks for the call
[3:02:38.100 --> 3:02:40.100]  Let's jam in another one here right now
[3:02:40.100 --> 3:02:42.100]  who's holding the longest here, let's talk to Alan
[3:02:42.100 --> 3:02:44.100]  Alan in Pennsylvania, go ahead
[3:02:44.100 --> 3:02:47.100]  Hi Alex, it's an honor to talk to you
[3:02:47.100 --> 3:02:49.100]  Honor to talk to you brother, what's on your mind today?
[3:02:49.100 --> 3:02:52.100]  I just wanted to let you know how you
[3:02:52.100 --> 3:02:54.100]  have helped me through this past two years
[3:02:54.100 --> 3:02:57.100]  I've been confused in a trance even
[3:02:57.100 --> 3:03:00.100]  and watching the news
[3:03:00.100 --> 3:03:03.100]  and nothing making sense and feeling alone
[3:03:03.100 --> 3:03:06.100]  and finally finding the truth or a voice
[3:03:06.100 --> 3:03:09.100]  to help me and everyone around me
[3:03:09.100 --> 3:03:13.100]  to feel like you're not alone
[3:03:13.100 --> 3:03:15.100]  Exactly brother, you're not alone
[3:03:15.100 --> 3:03:17.100]  and we're over the target
[3:03:17.100 --> 3:03:19.100]  We know what we're talking about, anybody can check it out
[3:03:19.100 --> 3:03:21.100]  What do you think about just the vaccines
[3:03:21.100 --> 3:03:23.100]  turning out to be poison
[3:03:23.100 --> 3:03:25.100]  the huge awakening happening right now
[3:03:25.100 --> 3:03:27.100]  It's a big one, they hope we just forget about
[3:03:27.100 --> 3:03:29.100]  the last two years what they did to us
[3:03:29.100 --> 3:03:31.100]  I don't see that happening
[3:03:31.100 --> 3:03:33.100]  Yeah, I don't see how that could happen
[3:03:33.100 --> 3:03:35.100]  with the mass of the children
[3:03:35.100 --> 3:03:37.100]  and just the effect it's had on them
[3:03:37.100 --> 3:03:39.100]  suicide
[3:03:39.100 --> 3:03:41.100]  Even the targeted transgenderism
[3:03:41.100 --> 3:03:43.100]  through homeschooling
[3:03:43.100 --> 3:03:45.100]  I think
[3:03:45.100 --> 3:03:47.100]  I can't forgive the past years
[3:03:47.100 --> 3:03:49.100]  what they've done to me and my family
[3:03:49.100 --> 3:03:51.100]  No matter whether it's in Europe or here
[3:03:51.100 --> 3:03:53.100]  We didn't tell you your elementary girls
[3:03:53.100 --> 3:03:55.100]  will be sleeping with men
[3:03:55.100 --> 3:03:57.100]  It's no big deal, it's liberal
[3:03:57.100 --> 3:03:59.100]  their whole religion is pedophilia
[3:03:59.100 --> 3:04:01.100]  That's why it's all deceptive
[3:04:01.100 --> 3:04:05.100]  and sneaky and it's destroying our future
[3:04:05.100 --> 3:04:07.100]  It's destroying civilization
[3:04:07.100 --> 3:04:09.100]  The Facebook, the Twitter, the Instagram
[3:04:09.100 --> 3:04:11.100]  all of it, I think it needs to go
[3:04:11.100 --> 3:04:13.100]  and I think we need to go back to
[3:04:13.100 --> 3:04:15.100]  one-on-one
[3:04:15.100 --> 3:04:17.100]  conversations
[3:04:17.100 --> 3:04:19.100]  and just trusting each other
[3:04:19.100 --> 3:04:21.100]  and believing in each other
[3:04:21.100 --> 3:04:23.100]  and trying to come together
[3:04:23.100 --> 3:04:25.100]  as a people
[3:04:25.100 --> 3:04:27.100]  I totally agree, God bless you Alan
[3:04:27.100 --> 3:04:29.100]  Alright
[3:04:29.100 --> 3:04:31.100]  George and Camilla, you're up next
[3:04:31.100 --> 3:04:33.100]  then Stacey, Jake and Steve
[3:04:33.100 --> 3:04:35.100]  then the one and only
[3:04:35.100 --> 3:04:37.100]  Gerald Salente, loaded for bear
[3:04:37.100 --> 3:04:39.100]  always fired up, the top trans forecaster
[3:04:39.100 --> 3:04:41.100]  takes over today
[3:04:41.100 --> 3:04:43.100]  and then in 55 minutes from now
[3:04:43.100 --> 3:04:45.100]  Owen Schreuer, he's got
[3:04:45.100 --> 3:04:47.100]  Marjorie Taylor Greene
[3:04:47.100 --> 3:04:49.100]  in studio
[3:04:49.100 --> 3:04:51.100]  interview, that's right, she was here last night with me
[3:04:51.100 --> 3:04:53.100]  she's with Owen today
[3:04:57.100 --> 3:04:59.100]  Mike in California, thanks for calling
[3:04:59.100 --> 3:05:01.100]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree
[3:05:01.100 --> 3:05:03.100]  we're calling this gain-of-function research
[3:05:03.100 --> 3:05:05.100]  now if you read the actual
[3:05:05.100 --> 3:05:07.100]  2014 legislation, the US government
[3:05:07.100 --> 3:05:09.100]  gain-of-function deliberative
[3:05:09.100 --> 3:05:11.100]  process and research funding
[3:05:11.100 --> 3:05:13.100]  pause on selected gain-of-function
[3:05:13.100 --> 3:05:15.100]  research involving influenza, MERS
[3:05:15.100 --> 3:05:17.100]  and SARS viruses
[3:05:17.100 --> 3:05:19.100]  there's nothing about SARS-like viruses
[3:05:19.100 --> 3:05:21.100]  and it's a research funding pause
[3:05:21.100 --> 3:05:23.100]  it's not a stop, it's not a prohibition
[3:05:23.100 --> 3:05:25.100]  it's when you come to a four-way intersection
[3:05:25.100 --> 3:05:27.100]  there's the stop sign, you stop, you look both ways
[3:05:27.100 --> 3:05:29.100]  and then you proceed
[3:05:29.100 --> 3:05:31.100]  pause all gain-of-function
[3:05:31.100 --> 3:05:33.100]  just selected gain-of-function
[3:05:33.100 --> 3:05:35.100]  but they'll argue that this is actually characterization
[3:05:35.100 --> 3:05:37.100]  and qualification research
[3:05:37.100 --> 3:05:39.100]  so Rand and others, maybe Fauci was right
[3:05:39.100 --> 3:05:41.100]  they don't quite know what they're talking about
[3:05:41.100 --> 3:05:43.100]  calling it gain-of-function
[3:05:43.100 --> 3:05:45.100]  that's why he didn't perjure himself
[3:05:45.100 --> 3:05:47.100]  that's why he hasn't been arrested
[3:05:47.100 --> 3:05:49.100]  because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms
[3:05:49.100 --> 3:05:51.100]  that mimic what the viruses do
[3:05:51.100 --> 3:05:53.100]  but in the main definition, it's still a gain-of-function
[3:05:53.100 --> 3:05:55.100]  you're making something deadly
[3:05:55.100 --> 3:05:57.100]  that spreads more easily to hurt people
[3:05:57.100 --> 3:05:59.100]  you're listening to a frontline report
[3:05:59.100 --> 3:06:01.100]  you are listening to an infowars.com
[3:06:01.100 --> 3:06:03.100]  frontline report
[3:06:03.100 --> 3:06:05.100]  it's Alex Jones
[3:06:05.100 --> 3:06:07.100]  alright, we're going to go to Stacy
[3:06:07.100 --> 3:06:09.100]  we're going to go to Jake
[3:06:09.100 --> 3:06:11.100]  we're going to go to Steve
[3:06:11.100 --> 3:06:13.100]  we're going to go to George
[3:06:13.100 --> 3:06:15.100]  remember, God is in control of all of this
[3:06:15.100 --> 3:06:17.100]  and we're just blown away
[3:06:17.100 --> 3:06:19.100]  and blessed to be in the presence of
[3:06:19.100 --> 3:06:21.100]  the Great Spirit
[3:06:21.100 --> 3:06:23.100]  God is in control of all of this
[3:06:23.100 --> 3:06:25.100]  and we're just blown away
[3:06:25.100 --> 3:06:27.100]  by the presence of the Great Spirit
[3:06:27.100 --> 3:06:29.100]  let's go ahead
[3:06:29.100 --> 3:06:31.100]  and talk to
[3:06:31.100 --> 3:06:33.100]  George in Canada than Stacy
[3:06:33.100 --> 3:06:35.100]  George, go ahead
[3:06:35.100 --> 3:06:37.100]  yes, Al
[3:06:37.100 --> 3:06:39.100]  I've been listening to you for ages
[3:06:39.100 --> 3:06:41.100]  almost 25 years myself
[3:06:41.100 --> 3:06:43.100]  and I've been going after things
[3:06:43.100 --> 3:06:45.100]  what I'm saying today is about
[3:06:45.100 --> 3:06:47.100]  I was going to start off about the
[3:06:47.100 --> 3:06:49.100]  Mayor's
[3:06:49.100 --> 3:06:51.100]  and the Mayor in Ottawa
[3:06:51.100 --> 3:06:53.100]  and his controls on that
[3:06:53.100 --> 3:06:55.100]  the Ford
[3:06:55.100 --> 3:06:57.100]  watch it, isn't it
[3:06:57.100 --> 3:06:59.100]  there's a bunch of them
[3:06:59.100 --> 3:07:01.100]  anyway, that's just one
[3:07:01.100 --> 3:07:03.100]  that's the premier of Quebec
[3:07:03.100 --> 3:07:05.100]  Ford
[3:07:05.100 --> 3:07:07.100]  ok, and then there's like Toronto
[3:07:07.100 --> 3:07:09.100]  and all these other places
[3:07:09.100 --> 3:07:11.100]  so I would ask you
[3:07:11.100 --> 3:07:13.100]  if you could
[3:07:13.100 --> 3:07:15.100]  those connections are with
[3:07:15.100 --> 3:07:17.100]  everything
[3:07:17.100 --> 3:07:19.100]  including their head of chief of police
[3:07:19.100 --> 3:07:21.100]  and it's the same
[3:07:21.100 --> 3:07:23.100]  each one of those
[3:07:23.100 --> 3:07:25.100]  there are
[3:07:25.100 --> 3:07:27.100]  just hundreds of mayors
[3:07:27.100 --> 3:07:29.100]  each one is connected
[3:07:29.100 --> 3:07:31.100]  it's called the FCM
[3:07:31.100 --> 3:07:33.100]  but what I want you to look up
[3:07:33.100 --> 3:07:35.100]  because you're going to get a real surprise
[3:07:35.100 --> 3:07:37.100]  is Big City Mayor's Caucus
[3:07:37.100 --> 3:07:39.100]  BCMC
[3:07:39.100 --> 3:07:41.100]  ok, so I've been fighting this
[3:07:41.100 --> 3:07:43.100]  for years and I've been threatened
[3:07:43.100 --> 3:07:45.100]  enough times
[3:07:45.100 --> 3:07:47.100]  and I just want to get this out
[3:07:47.100 --> 3:07:49.100]  you know, so
[3:07:49.100 --> 3:07:51.100]  I remember Schwarzenegger
[3:07:51.100 --> 3:07:53.100]  like ten years ago
[3:07:53.100 --> 3:07:55.100]  was at the UN meeting
[3:07:55.100 --> 3:07:57.100]  we cannot get the carbon tax through
[3:07:57.100 --> 3:07:59.100]  so we take over the cities
[3:07:59.100 --> 3:08:01.100]  and the towns and we implement
[3:08:01.100 --> 3:08:03.100]  and that's what they've done
[3:08:03.100 --> 3:08:05.100]  it's called immunization
[3:08:05.100 --> 3:08:07.100]  what do Canadians think
[3:08:07.100 --> 3:08:09.100]  of all the UN aircraft
[3:08:09.100 --> 3:08:11.100]  in the east, the west
[3:08:11.100 --> 3:08:13.100]  giant UN jets everywhere
[3:08:13.100 --> 3:08:15.100]  landing at the airports
[3:08:15.100 --> 3:08:17.100]  if you could look that up
[3:08:17.100 --> 3:08:19.100]  I really appreciate it
[3:08:19.100 --> 3:08:21.100]  I've been banned by the tour star
[3:08:21.100 --> 3:08:23.100]  and banned by most of my counselors
[3:08:23.100 --> 3:08:25.100]  and I'm banned by a lot of other people
[3:08:25.100 --> 3:08:27.100]  but this has been
[3:08:27.100 --> 3:08:29.100]  I've been banned by Toronto Star
[3:08:29.100 --> 3:08:31.100]  or my regular
[3:08:31.100 --> 3:08:33.100]  by going on
[3:08:33.100 --> 3:08:35.100]  16 years now
[3:08:35.100 --> 3:08:37.100]  because I've mentioned Agenda 21
[3:08:37.100 --> 3:08:39.100]  and I've been banned since
[3:08:39.100 --> 3:08:41.100]  well brother, God bless you, I appreciate your call
[3:08:41.100 --> 3:08:43.100]  keep fighting
[3:08:43.100 --> 3:08:45.100]  alright, let's talk to Stacy in Alabama
[3:08:45.100 --> 3:08:47.100]  Stacy
[3:08:47.100 --> 3:08:49.100]  Hi Alex
[3:08:49.100 --> 3:08:51.100]  my question is
[3:08:51.100 --> 3:08:53.100]  is that when Russia
[3:08:53.100 --> 3:08:55.100]  invades Ukraine
[3:08:55.100 --> 3:08:57.100]  what kind of effect is it going to have on us
[3:08:57.100 --> 3:08:59.100]  what do we need to do to prepare
[3:08:59.100 --> 3:09:01.100]  what are we going to see
[3:09:01.100 --> 3:09:03.100]  when this does happen
[3:09:03.100 --> 3:09:05.100]  your phone's a little bit echo
[3:09:05.100 --> 3:09:07.100]  we say that again
[3:09:07.100 --> 3:09:09.100]  okay, so when
[3:09:09.100 --> 3:09:11.100]  when Russia
[3:09:11.100 --> 3:09:13.100]  invades Ukraine
[3:09:13.100 --> 3:09:15.100]  what's going to happen
[3:09:15.100 --> 3:09:17.100]  how is that going to affect us here
[3:09:17.100 --> 3:09:19.100]  what's going to happen
[3:09:19.100 --> 3:09:21.100]  to all of us here
[3:09:21.100 --> 3:09:23.100]  are we going to see
[3:09:23.100 --> 3:09:25.100]  a big change in the economy here
[3:09:25.100 --> 3:09:27.100]  what does it mean for us
[3:09:27.100 --> 3:09:29.100]  that's a good question
[3:09:29.100 --> 3:09:31.100]  already, Biden says gas prices are up
[3:09:31.100 --> 3:09:33.100]  because of Putin, that's not true
[3:09:33.100 --> 3:09:35.100]  it's dollar devaluation, it's shutting down pipelines
[3:09:35.100 --> 3:09:37.100]  but
[3:09:37.100 --> 3:09:39.100]  if they just let Putin
[3:09:39.100 --> 3:09:41.100]  take over the eastern area of Ukraine
[3:09:41.100 --> 3:09:43.100]  and they start a peace deal
[3:09:43.100 --> 3:09:45.100]  then
[3:09:45.100 --> 3:09:47.100]  it'll just go away, but if they can start a larger war
[3:09:47.100 --> 3:09:49.100]  I don't know what's going to happen
[3:09:49.100 --> 3:09:51.100]  I don't know what's going to unfold
[3:09:51.100 --> 3:09:53.100]  but that's what
[3:09:53.100 --> 3:09:55.100]  I'm just kind of sitting here watching the news
[3:09:55.100 --> 3:09:57.100]  and I'm definitely
[3:09:57.100 --> 3:09:59.100]  I'm definitely keeping an eye on it
[3:09:59.100 --> 3:10:01.100]  sure, I'm in the same boat
[3:10:01.100 --> 3:10:03.100]  I don't know what's going to unfold
[3:10:03.100 --> 3:10:05.100]  I don't think the people that control
[3:10:05.100 --> 3:10:07.100]  Biden know
[3:10:07.100 --> 3:10:09.100]  I don't think Putin knows
[3:10:09.100 --> 3:10:11.100]  Russia doesn't want
[3:10:11.100 --> 3:10:13.100]  Western forces up on their border
[3:10:13.100 --> 3:10:15.100]  whether you agree with Russia or not, that's the reality
[3:10:15.100 --> 3:10:17.100]  of this and so they're still sovereign
[3:10:17.100 --> 3:10:19.100]  countries, the globalists don't control
[3:10:19.100 --> 3:10:21.100]  and that's why they're so upset
[3:10:21.100 --> 3:10:23.100]  okay, do you think that we, like the US
[3:10:23.100 --> 3:10:25.100]  is definitely antagonizing this war
[3:10:25.100 --> 3:10:27.100]  do you think we're kind of
[3:10:27.100 --> 3:10:29.100]  well, I mean it's not even the US
[3:10:29.100 --> 3:10:31.100]  we're like a quasi-globalist run
[3:10:31.100 --> 3:10:33.100]  system that they use
[3:10:33.100 --> 3:10:35.100]  and control
[3:10:35.100 --> 3:10:37.100]  but yeah, obviously the West believes it owns the world
[3:10:37.100 --> 3:10:39.100]  the people that own us
[3:10:39.100 --> 3:10:41.100]  that have taken over America believe they own us
[3:10:41.100 --> 3:10:43.100]  they believe they own everybody else
[3:10:43.100 --> 3:10:45.100]  they believe they own the Chinese
[3:10:45.100 --> 3:10:47.100]  through the communists they put in charge
[3:10:47.100 --> 3:10:49.100]  now the communists have double-crossed them
[3:10:49.100 --> 3:10:51.100]  so it's not like I'm endorsing Xi Jinping
[3:10:51.100 --> 3:10:53.100]  I'm just saying he's now double-crossing them
[3:10:53.100 --> 3:10:55.100]  so that's the reality of what's going on
[3:10:55.100 --> 3:10:57.100]  thank you for the call, really good questions
[3:10:57.100 --> 3:10:59.100]  let's talk to Steve in North Dakota
[3:10:59.100 --> 3:11:01.100]  Steve, Russia, Ukraine
[3:11:01.100 --> 3:11:03.100]  conflict, what's your take?
[3:11:03.100 --> 3:11:05.100]  well, first I got to say
[3:11:05.100 --> 3:11:07.100]  you were talking about music
[3:11:07.100 --> 3:11:09.100]  check out Kid Rock's new song, Weed the People
[3:11:09.100 --> 3:11:11.100]  great song
[3:11:11.100 --> 3:11:13.100]  I love that song, I'm at the play that last week
[3:11:13.100 --> 3:11:15.100]  it's awesome
[3:11:15.100 --> 3:11:17.100]  I don't think Putin wants Ukraine
[3:11:17.100 --> 3:11:19.100]  I think he wants to win
[3:11:19.100 --> 3:11:21.100]  because of the corruption
[3:11:21.100 --> 3:11:23.100]  you're really a Algerian mafia
[3:11:23.100 --> 3:11:25.100]  all the deep state
[3:11:25.100 --> 3:11:27.100]  Biden, Pelosi, Kerryville
[3:11:27.100 --> 3:11:29.100]  he said that, he said be your own country
[3:11:29.100 --> 3:11:31.100]  he said don't be part of Europe
[3:11:31.100 --> 3:11:33.100]  don't be controlled by NATO
[3:11:33.100 --> 3:11:35.100]  we don't want to run you
[3:11:35.100 --> 3:11:37.100]  just stop it
[3:11:37.100 --> 3:11:39.100]  that's where all those skeletons are buried
[3:11:39.100 --> 3:11:41.100]  and they don't want Putin to uncover the skeletons
[3:11:43.100 --> 3:11:45.100]  I may have an audio problem today
[3:11:45.100 --> 3:11:47.100]  my earpiece or whatever
[3:11:47.100 --> 3:11:49.100]  I'm in trouble understanding the callers
[3:11:49.100 --> 3:11:51.100]  can you hear me?
[3:11:51.100 --> 3:11:53.100]  I can hear you now
[3:11:53.100 --> 3:11:55.100]  Jim Kerry, Pelosi
[3:11:55.100 --> 3:11:57.100]  Biden, they all got kids
[3:11:57.100 --> 3:11:59.100]  getting high-paying jobs
[3:11:59.100 --> 3:12:01.100]  in Ukraine
[3:12:01.100 --> 3:12:03.100]  well said
[3:12:03.100 --> 3:12:05.100]  thank you so much sir, great point
[3:12:05.100 --> 3:12:07.100]  all right, Jake in Illinois, last caller before
[3:12:07.100 --> 3:12:09.100]  Gerald Salante takes over
[3:12:09.100 --> 3:12:11.100]  what's on your mind?
[3:12:11.100 --> 3:12:13.100]  good talking to you guys
[3:12:13.100 --> 3:12:15.100]  I just wanted to say
[3:12:15.100 --> 3:12:17.100]  I think the whole
[3:12:17.100 --> 3:12:19.100]  Russia-Ukraine situation
[3:12:19.100 --> 3:12:21.100]  is kind of the same as China-Taiwan
[3:12:21.100 --> 3:12:23.100]  the only difference is
[3:12:23.100 --> 3:12:25.100]  you don't hear about China-Taiwan on the news
[3:12:25.100 --> 3:12:27.100]  it's a good point
[3:12:27.100 --> 3:12:29.100]  you never hear about that
[3:12:29.100 --> 3:12:31.100]  I also know they're kind of owned by China
[3:12:31.100 --> 3:12:33.100]  but I kind of believe
[3:12:33.100 --> 3:12:35.100]  also that AUKUS
[3:12:35.100 --> 3:12:37.100]  and Russia
[3:12:37.100 --> 3:12:39.100]  there's a joint alliance
[3:12:39.100 --> 3:12:41.100]  between China and Russia
[3:12:41.100 --> 3:12:43.100]  that take what's theirs as in Taiwan and Ukraine
[3:12:43.100 --> 3:12:45.100]  so I kind of think AUKUS
[3:12:45.100 --> 3:12:47.100]  is kind of working with them
[3:12:47.100 --> 3:12:49.100]  with the global leaders
[3:12:49.100 --> 3:12:51.100]  and they're going to use this as a
[3:12:51.100 --> 3:12:53.100]  false flag
[3:12:53.100 --> 3:12:55.100]  to do whatever they want
[3:12:55.100 --> 3:12:57.100]  they knew the United States
[3:12:57.100 --> 3:12:59.100]  but at the same time it's just advancing
[3:12:59.100 --> 3:13:01.100]  their strategy
[3:13:01.100 --> 3:13:03.100]  I also wanted to talk about
[3:13:03.100 --> 3:13:05.100]  how there's no 5G in Mexico
[3:13:05.100 --> 3:13:07.100]  but I think that kind of goes hand-in-hand
[3:13:07.100 --> 3:13:09.100]  with Bill Gates owning
[3:13:09.100 --> 3:13:11.100]  all those farmland, probably selling it to
[3:13:11.100 --> 3:13:13.100]  high-intel Chinese people
[3:13:13.100 --> 3:13:15.100]  I think they're going to try to move us down there
[3:13:15.100 --> 3:13:17.100]  after they do something crazy
[3:13:17.100 --> 3:13:19.100]  I really think
[3:13:19.100 --> 3:13:21.100]  they're just going to plan to go to like Argentina
[3:13:21.100 --> 3:13:23.100]  New York, Antarctica, kind of like the Nazis
[3:13:23.100 --> 3:13:25.100]  we're planning on when they want to do a world war
[3:13:25.100 --> 3:13:27.100]  well that's right, I mean it always begins
[3:13:27.100 --> 3:13:29.100]  with taking a small area
[3:13:29.100 --> 3:13:31.100]  and setting the precedent and grabbing more and more
[3:13:31.100 --> 3:13:33.100]  that's how world war one began, world war two
[3:13:33.100 --> 3:13:35.100]  and I'm not defending everything
[3:13:35.100 --> 3:13:37.100]  the Russians are doing, I'm just pointing out the reality of it
[3:13:37.100 --> 3:13:39.100]  in the case
[3:13:39.100 --> 3:13:41.100]  the Russians aren't
[3:13:41.100 --> 3:13:43.100]  devil-worshipping child molester communists
[3:13:43.100 --> 3:13:45.100]  like the Hollywood
[3:13:45.100 --> 3:13:47.100]  and the Chinese are still super evil communists
[3:13:47.100 --> 3:13:49.100]  so when they're taking over Hong Kong or Taiwan
[3:13:49.100 --> 3:13:51.100]  and breaking agreements, I'm against it
[3:13:51.100 --> 3:13:53.100]  but when Russia historically
[3:13:53.100 --> 3:13:55.100]  is taking over an area it's controlled
[3:13:55.100 --> 3:13:57.100]  and the West is attacking it
[3:13:57.100 --> 3:13:59.100]  and the West is literally coming
[3:13:59.100 --> 3:14:01.100]  to take Russian testicles
[3:14:01.100 --> 3:14:03.100]  and scalps their religion
[3:14:03.100 --> 3:14:05.100]  of the left, like to do here
[3:14:05.100 --> 3:14:07.100]  it's hard to side against Russia
[3:14:07.100 --> 3:14:09.100]  but regardless, I believe in a Monroe doctrine
[3:14:09.100 --> 3:14:11.100]  if Russians were on our border doing this
[3:14:11.100 --> 3:14:13.100]  I'd be say go to war with Russia
[3:14:13.100 --> 3:14:15.100]  but they're not, does that make sense?
[3:14:15.100 --> 3:14:17.100]  Yeah, but we're kind of doing the same thing to China
[3:14:17.100 --> 3:14:19.100]  I mean they're controlled obviously
[3:14:19.100 --> 3:14:21.100]  it kind of looks as
[3:14:21.100 --> 3:14:23.100]  the optics like they're backing away from the New World Order
[3:14:23.100 --> 3:14:25.100]  but I mean the Korean
[3:14:25.100 --> 3:14:27.100]  and Vietnam War I mean...
[3:14:27.100 --> 3:14:29.100]  So what do you propose happens? I mean I'm just trying to...
[3:14:29.100 --> 3:14:31.100]  so what are you saying? I mean I know all these sides
[3:14:31.100 --> 3:14:33.100]  are fighting with each other
[3:14:33.100 --> 3:14:35.100]  what should happen?
[3:14:35.100 --> 3:14:37.100]  They don't get the blame
[3:14:37.100 --> 3:14:39.100]  but I basically think they're just going to use it as control
[3:14:39.100 --> 3:14:41.100]  I think Putin's kind of being put on the hot feet
[3:14:41.100 --> 3:14:43.100]  with the globalist elite
[3:14:43.100 --> 3:14:45.100]  Yeah, because they don't like sovereign countries
[3:14:45.100 --> 3:14:47.100]  I agree with you. Thanks for the call brother
[3:14:47.100 --> 3:14:49.100]  Wow, a lot of amazing calls today
[3:14:49.100 --> 3:14:51.100]  Owen Schreuer comes up in 45 minutes
[3:14:51.100 --> 3:14:53.100]  Gerald Salente
[3:14:53.100 --> 3:14:55.100]  the top trends forecaster was on fire last week

[3:16:19.100 --> 3:16:21.100]  we are here to introduce you to the
[3:16:21.100 --> 3:16:23.100]  sun god tagaloa
[3:16:23.100 --> 3:16:25.100]  who they consider to be the supreme ruler
[3:16:25.100 --> 3:16:27.100]  and creator of the universe
[3:16:27.100 --> 3:16:29.100]  the Samoan people would drink kava tea
[3:16:29.100 --> 3:16:31.100]  during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies
[3:16:31.100 --> 3:16:33.100]  to loosen up a little
[3:16:33.100 --> 3:16:35.100]  nowadays kava is used around the world
[3:16:35.100 --> 3:16:37.100]  by many who enjoy its serious benefits
[3:16:37.100 --> 3:16:39.100]  the new kava chill by dr. jones natural
[3:16:39.100 --> 3:16:41.100]  contains a full blend of
[3:16:41.100 --> 3:16:43.100]  not only kava kava, but other herbs

[3:16:45.100 --> 3:16:47.100]  german chamomile, organic skullcap
[3:16:47.100 --> 3:16:49.100]  and ballerian root

[3:16:53.100 --> 3:17:22.100]  by visiting infowarstore.com
[3:17:23.100 --> 3:17:25.100]  our whole project is falling apart
[3:17:25.100 --> 3:17:27.100]  because the people are aware
[3:17:27.100 --> 3:17:29.100]  that it is a world government
[3:17:29.100 --> 3:17:31.100]  corporate takeover
[3:17:31.100 --> 3:17:33.100]  and so it's pulling back the curtain
[3:17:33.100 --> 3:17:35.100]  now more than ever
[3:17:35.100 --> 3:17:37.100]  the problem is some globalist controlled areas
[3:17:37.100 --> 3:17:39.100]  are not going to give up on their takeover
[3:17:39.100 --> 3:17:41.100]  like canada where they've now
[3:17:41.100 --> 3:17:43.100]  declared a civil emergency
[3:17:43.100 --> 3:17:45.100]  in marshal law in ontario
[3:17:45.100 --> 3:17:47.100]  and other areas of the world are following suit
[3:17:47.100 --> 3:17:49.100]  like australia, so pray for these folks
[3:17:49.100 --> 3:17:51.100]  big time, it's a very serious situation
[3:17:51.100 --> 3:17:53.100]  and stay tuned to infowarstore.com
[3:17:53.100 --> 3:17:55.100]  because truth is absolutely paramount

[3:18:27.100 --> 3:18:29.100]  we are cooks and we are taxi drivers
[3:18:29.100 --> 3:18:31.100]  and we know everything about you
[3:18:31.100 --> 3:18:33.100]  we process your insurance claims

[3:18:37.100 --> 3:18:39.100]  we are the middle children of history
[3:18:39.100 --> 3:18:41.100]  raised by television to believe
[3:18:41.100 --> 3:18:43.100]  that someday we'll be millionaires
[3:18:43.100 --> 3:18:45.100]  and movie stars
[3:18:45.100 --> 3:18:47.100]  but we won't
[3:18:47.100 --> 3:18:49.100]  be your friends
[3:18:49.100 --> 3:18:51.100]  support independent media
[3:18:51.100 --> 3:19:19.100]  and infowarstore.com

[3:19:21.100 --> 3:19:23.100]  or your big city
[3:19:23.100 --> 3:19:25.100]  to write something on the bathroom wall
[3:19:25.100 --> 3:19:27.100]  or to put a sticker on your car
[3:19:27.100 --> 3:19:29.100]  or banner hangs over highways
[3:19:29.100 --> 3:19:31.100]  and it will be a chain reaction
[3:19:31.100 --> 3:19:33.100]  what do you recommend people say on these banner hangs
[3:19:33.100 --> 3:19:35.100]  I have a few ideas
[3:19:35.100 --> 3:19:37.100]  first of all, health justice
[3:19:37.100 --> 3:19:39.100]  the vaccine is poison
[3:19:39.100 --> 3:19:41.100]  there's times of things I say
[3:19:41.100 --> 3:19:43.100]  just keep it short, keep it concise
[3:19:43.100 --> 3:19:45.100]  don't agree, arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates
[3:19:45.100 --> 3:19:47.100]  the covid backs is poison
[3:19:47.100 --> 3:19:49.100]  we could all be involved if we could all be affected
[3:19:49.100 --> 3:19:51.100]  so that's what I'm calling about
[3:19:51.100 --> 3:19:53.100]  God bless you Chris in Atlanta
[3:19:53.100 --> 3:19:55.100]  I really really appreciate you calling us today

[3:24:47.100 --> 3:24:49.100]  want peace
[3:24:49.100 --> 3:24:51.100]  we're war mongers
[3:24:51.100 --> 3:24:53.100]  not a peep about peace
[3:24:53.100 --> 3:24:55.100]  and not a peep about peace in the prostitutes
[3:24:55.100 --> 3:24:57.100]  prostitute days
[3:24:57.100 --> 3:24:59.100]  that's right
[3:24:59.100 --> 3:25:01.100]  here you go
[3:25:01.100 --> 3:25:03.100]  really good at killing people folks
[3:25:03.100 --> 3:25:05.100]  folks yep
[3:25:05.100 --> 3:25:07.100]  he never stopped fokking
[3:25:07.100 --> 3:25:09.100]  there he goes on
[3:25:11.100 --> 3:25:13.100]  this is from wikipedia
[3:25:13.100 --> 3:25:15.100]  Washington continues to express
[3:25:15.100 --> 3:25:17.100]  his support of the union
[3:25:17.100 --> 3:25:19.100]  by giving some examples of how he believes
[3:25:19.100 --> 3:25:21.100]  that the country its regions
[3:25:21.100 --> 3:25:23.100]  and its people are already
[3:25:23.100 --> 3:25:25.100]  benefiting from the unity
[3:25:25.100 --> 3:25:27.100]  which they currently share
[3:25:27.100 --> 3:25:29.100]  he then looks to the future
[3:25:29.100 --> 3:25:31.100]  in his belief
[3:25:31.100 --> 3:25:33.100]  that the combined effort
[3:25:33.100 --> 3:25:35.100]  and resources of its people
[3:25:35.100 --> 3:25:37.100]  will protect the country
[3:25:37.100 --> 3:25:39.100]  from foreign attack
[3:25:39.100 --> 3:25:41.100]  and allow them to avoid
[3:25:41.100 --> 3:25:43.100]  wars between neighboring
[3:25:43.100 --> 3:25:45.100]  nations that often happen
[3:25:45.100 --> 3:25:47.100]  due to rivalries
[3:25:47.100 --> 3:25:49.100]  and competing relations
[3:25:49.100 --> 3:25:51.100]  with foreign nations
[3:25:51.100 --> 3:25:53.100]  he argues that the security
[3:25:53.100 --> 3:25:55.100]  provided by the union
[3:25:55.100 --> 3:25:57.100]  will also allow the united states
[3:25:57.100 --> 3:25:59.100]  to avoid
[3:25:59.100 --> 3:26:01.100]  the creation
[3:26:01.100 --> 3:26:03.100]  of an overgrown military
[3:26:03.100 --> 3:26:05.100]  which he sees
[3:26:05.100 --> 3:26:07.100]  as a great threat to liberty
[3:26:07.100 --> 3:26:09.100]  especially
[3:26:09.100 --> 3:26:11.100]  the republican liberty
[3:26:11.100 --> 3:26:13.100]  which the united states
[3:26:13.100 --> 3:26:15.100]  has created
[3:26:15.100 --> 3:26:17.100]  that's out of wikipedia
[3:26:17.100 --> 3:26:19.100]  afraid of the military
[3:26:19.100 --> 3:26:21.100]  I guess it took
[3:26:21.100 --> 3:26:23.100]  how many years for
[3:26:23.100 --> 3:26:25.100]  Dwight D. Eisenhower
[3:26:25.100 --> 3:26:27.100]  five star general
[3:26:27.100 --> 3:26:29.100]  supreme commander
[3:26:29.100 --> 3:26:31.100]  of the allied forces
[3:26:31.100 --> 3:26:33.100]  two-term president
[3:26:35.100 --> 3:26:37.100]  January 17th
[3:26:37.100 --> 3:26:39.100]  1961
[3:26:39.100 --> 3:26:41.100]  farewell address
[3:26:41.100 --> 3:26:43.100]  warning the American people
[3:26:43.100 --> 3:26:45.100]  that the military industrial complex
[3:26:47.100 --> 3:26:49.100]  has robbed the nation
[3:26:49.100 --> 3:26:51.100]  of the genius of the scientists
[3:26:51.100 --> 3:26:53.100]  the sweat of the laborers
[3:26:53.100 --> 3:26:55.100]  and the future of the children
[3:26:55.100 --> 3:26:57.100]  screw Washington
[3:26:57.100 --> 3:26:59.100]  hell with Eisenhower

[3:27:05.100 --> 3:27:07.100]  they're mad dog madis
[3:27:07.100 --> 3:27:09.100]  did a great job in Afghanistan
[3:27:09.100 --> 3:27:11.100]  love the slaughter you created
[3:27:11.100 --> 3:27:13.100]  in Iraq
[3:27:13.100 --> 3:27:15.100]  Washington would have loved you
[3:27:15.100 --> 3:27:17.100]  he would have flushed you down the toilet
[3:27:17.100 --> 3:27:19.100]  oh they didn't have toilets
[3:27:19.100 --> 3:27:21.100]  back then down the outhouse
[3:27:23.100 --> 3:27:25.100]  yeah
[3:27:25.100 --> 3:27:27.100]  Washington
[3:27:27.100 --> 3:27:29.100]  makes extended reference
[3:27:29.100 --> 3:27:31.100]  to the damages
[3:27:31.100 --> 3:27:33.100]  the dangers excuse me
[3:27:33.100 --> 3:27:35.100]  of foreign nations
[3:27:35.100 --> 3:27:37.100]  who will seek to influence
[3:27:37.100 --> 3:27:39.100]  the American people and government
[3:27:39.100 --> 3:27:41.100]  nations
[3:27:41.100 --> 3:27:43.100]  who may be considered friendly
[3:27:43.100 --> 3:27:45.100]  as well as nations
[3:27:45.100 --> 3:27:47.100]  considered enemies
[3:27:47.100 --> 3:27:49.100]  will equally try to influence the government
[3:27:49.100 --> 3:27:51.100]  to do their will
[3:27:53.100 --> 3:27:55.100]  real patriots
[3:27:55.100 --> 3:27:57.100]  he warns
[3:27:57.100 --> 3:27:59.100]  who resist the intrigues
[3:27:59.100 --> 3:28:01.100]  of foreign nations
[3:28:01.100 --> 3:28:03.100]  may find themselves
[3:28:03.100 --> 3:28:05.100]  suspected and odious
[3:28:05.100 --> 3:28:07.100]  in the eyes of others
[3:28:07.100 --> 3:28:09.100]  yet he urges the people
[3:28:09.100 --> 3:28:11.100]  to stand firm
[3:28:11.100 --> 3:28:13.100]  against such influences
[3:28:13.100 --> 3:28:15.100]  all the same
[3:28:15.100 --> 3:28:17.100]  we must stand
[3:28:17.100 --> 3:28:19.100]  firm
[3:28:19.100 --> 3:28:21.100]  on peace
[3:28:21.100 --> 3:28:23.100]  not a peep
[3:28:23.100 --> 3:28:25.100]  politicians
[3:28:25.100 --> 3:28:27.100]  not a peep
[3:28:27.100 --> 3:28:29.100]  from the prostitutes about peace
[3:28:29.100 --> 3:28:31.100]  and then we'll get back

[3:28:33.100 --> 3:28:35.100]  and Alex Jones has been
[3:28:35.100 --> 3:28:37.100]  covering
[3:28:37.100 --> 3:28:39.100]  and then a woman called up earlier
[3:28:39.100 --> 3:28:41.100]  what's going to be the implications
[3:28:41.100 --> 3:28:43.100]  if we go to war with Ukraine
[3:28:43.100 --> 3:28:45.100]  we get back we'll talk about that
[3:28:45.100 --> 3:28:47.100]  but in the meantime

[3:30:43.900 --> 3:30:47.460]  But we won't, and we're just learning this fact.
[3:30:47.460 --> 3:30:50.740]  So don't fuck with us.

[3:30:58.180 --> 3:31:01.300]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days

[3:33:35.020 --> 3:33:38.620]  Hey, great being on info wars.
[3:33:38.620 --> 3:33:42.380]  And remember everyone, do what you can to support info wars.
[3:33:42.380 --> 3:33:44.300]  And they're stealing the truth from us.
[3:33:44.300 --> 3:33:46.140]  We're not allowed to speak out
[3:33:46.140 --> 3:33:48.100]  in anything that we wanna say
[3:33:48.100 --> 3:33:51.020]  if we don't believe what the government tells you.
[3:33:51.020 --> 3:33:54.180]  And they had this article in Yahoo talking about that.
[3:33:54.180 --> 3:33:58.500]  This guy, legendary investor Charles Munger,
[3:33:58.500 --> 3:34:03.660]  speaking at U2 Finance, editor-in-chief Andy Sewer.
[3:34:03.660 --> 3:34:06.060]  Yeah, and Sewer, Sewer and whatever,
[3:34:06.900 --> 3:34:08.820]  in an executive exclusive interview
[3:34:08.820 --> 3:34:11.700]  who spoke bluntly about vaccine hesitancy.
[3:34:11.700 --> 3:34:15.020]  This is his quote, part of it.
[3:34:15.020 --> 3:34:18.420]  If I were running the world, Munger said,
[3:34:18.420 --> 3:34:20.500]  if you were running the world,
[3:34:20.500 --> 3:34:22.620]  what kind of psychopath are you?
[3:34:22.620 --> 3:34:26.420]  Who the hell are you to even say something like that?
[3:34:26.420 --> 3:34:29.340]  If I was running the world, hey Salente, don't you know?
[3:34:29.340 --> 3:34:32.740]  I'm a legendary finance, I know how to make a lot of money.
[3:34:32.740 --> 3:34:34.740]  Big deal, that's great.
[3:34:34.740 --> 3:34:36.660]  I'd had to write a great magazine, man,
[3:34:36.660 --> 3:34:41.660]  and I'll out fact you on the facts anytime, any day, any place.
[3:34:41.860 --> 3:34:46.700]  So, but going on, if I were running the world
[3:34:46.700 --> 3:34:48.300]  of vaccine mandate, he goes,
[3:34:48.300 --> 3:34:51.060]  of course it would be mandatory.
[3:34:51.060 --> 3:34:53.860]  When I was in World War II's army,
[3:34:53.860 --> 3:34:56.900]  they didn't ask me if I wanted a vaccination.
[3:34:56.900 --> 3:34:58.280]  They just vaccinated me.
[3:34:59.300 --> 3:35:01.020]  It didn't hurt me or anybody else.
[3:35:01.020 --> 3:35:06.020]  In the world, we all just submitted
[3:35:07.700 --> 3:35:11.100]  to whatever the government told us to submit to.
[3:35:12.340 --> 3:35:16.900]  We all just submitted to whatever the government
[3:35:16.900 --> 3:35:18.980]  told us to submit to.
[3:35:18.980 --> 3:35:21.940]  What am I, six years old?
[3:35:21.940 --> 3:35:24.620]  You're still in high school.
[3:35:24.620 --> 3:35:28.060]  Oh, you're 98, you haven't graduated yet?
[3:35:28.060 --> 3:35:31.180]  Submit to what the government, boy,
[3:35:31.180 --> 3:35:33.580]  you're part of the new world's order.
[3:35:33.580 --> 3:35:35.420]  What government you're talking about?
[3:35:35.420 --> 3:35:36.740]  What's the government?
[3:35:36.740 --> 3:35:38.820]  What government are you talking about?
[3:35:40.820 --> 3:35:44.340]  Government, a bunch of dictators,
[3:35:45.260 --> 3:35:49.200]  a bunch of liars, cowards, freaks, and fools.
[3:35:50.180 --> 3:35:53.380]  Submit, get this in your head,
[3:35:53.380 --> 3:35:58.380]  manga and every other dictator out there.
[3:35:59.140 --> 3:36:02.260]  I was not put on this earth to take orders.
[3:36:04.060 --> 3:36:09.060]  I obey the laws of nature and the divine spirits,
[3:36:10.420 --> 3:36:15.420]  not low life politics, polytics, many tics
[3:36:16.420 --> 3:36:18.500]  that suck the life out of us,
[3:36:18.500 --> 3:36:23.420]  little boys and girls, arrogant little creeps,
[3:36:24.620 --> 3:36:26.260]  who never work a day in their life
[3:36:26.260 --> 3:36:28.220]  and suck off the public tit,
[3:36:28.220 --> 3:36:32.340]  like Biden been sucking off the public tit
[3:36:32.340 --> 3:36:35.620]  since he's 30 years old, yeah.
[3:36:36.660 --> 3:36:41.660]  Submit, again, it's total control
[3:36:43.780 --> 3:36:47.060]  and that's why you need to support Infowars
[3:36:47.060 --> 3:36:50.660]  because they're gonna keep robbing it from us
[3:36:50.660 --> 3:36:52.720]  over and over again.
[3:36:54.220 --> 3:36:56.220]  And Washington's, Washington's,
[3:36:57.900 --> 3:36:59.540]  Washington's day.
[3:36:59.540 --> 3:37:02.460]  Washington argued that longstanding poor relations
[3:37:02.460 --> 3:37:05.500]  will only lead to unnecessary wars
[3:37:05.500 --> 3:37:08.300]  due to this tendency to blow.
[3:37:08.300 --> 3:37:11.780]  Minor offenses out of proportion
[3:37:11.780 --> 3:37:15.500]  when committed by nations viewed as enemies
[3:37:15.500 --> 3:37:18.140]  of the United States.
[3:37:18.140 --> 3:37:21.700]  Yeah, he only nailed that, you know.
[3:37:23.180 --> 3:37:24.540]  Back when he was president,
[3:37:24.540 --> 3:37:26.580]  the first president of the United States
[3:37:26.580 --> 3:37:29.940]  and it's right in front of everybody's eyes right now.
[3:37:29.940 --> 3:37:31.980]  Oh, and talking about the low life pieces
[3:37:31.980 --> 3:37:35.900]  of scum crap politicians that all wanna go to war.
[3:37:35.900 --> 3:37:38.980]  Hey, little Lindsey Graham, come out of the closet,
[3:37:38.980 --> 3:37:40.620]  pick up the gun and go to war.
[3:37:40.620 --> 3:37:42.420]  No, little Mitch McConnell.
[3:37:42.420 --> 3:37:45.020]  Oh, you're a real fighter, go to war.
[3:37:45.020 --> 3:37:49.860]  No, no, no, little Chuck E. Schumer, little Chuck E. Schumer.
[3:37:49.860 --> 3:37:53.420]  Oh, and Nancy Pelosi and Diana Sofinstein,
[3:37:53.420 --> 3:37:57.900]  everybody's equal, get out there and pick up those guns.
[3:37:57.900 --> 3:38:00.620]  Go fight the Russians.
[3:38:02.500 --> 3:38:06.300]  Now we won't, Salenti will get you killed
[3:38:06.300 --> 3:38:07.980]  by shooting your mouth off
[3:38:09.300 --> 3:38:11.700]  and we'll send out little boys and girls
[3:38:11.700 --> 3:38:16.580]  to believe the crap we spew out.
[3:38:16.580 --> 3:38:19.100]  Yeah, look at her.
[3:38:19.100 --> 3:38:21.820]  Show me a fighter there.
[3:38:21.820 --> 3:38:25.420]  Not one, not men.
[3:38:25.420 --> 3:38:28.380]  Arrogant little boys.
[3:38:28.380 --> 3:38:31.180]  Well, I've been watching this thing this in Canada
[3:38:31.180 --> 3:38:34.260]  with the emergency act that they passed
[3:38:34.260 --> 3:38:36.020]  and they're debating it now
[3:38:36.020 --> 3:38:37.940]  and I'm watching a guy, a woman up there
[3:38:37.940 --> 3:38:41.900]  that's dressed up in his costume drag.
[3:38:41.900 --> 3:38:44.140]  Honorable, this is not honorable.
[3:38:44.140 --> 3:38:46.740]  What, are you still in high school?
[3:38:46.740 --> 3:38:49.580]  Stop this crap, honorable.
[3:38:49.580 --> 3:38:53.980]  Don't screw yourself, you're more honorable than me.
[3:38:53.980 --> 3:38:57.100]  Hey, Salenti, we got elected.
[3:38:57.100 --> 3:39:01.420]  We were smart enough to be a solo to people.
[3:39:01.420 --> 3:39:03.540]  We're honorable.
[3:39:03.540 --> 3:39:06.620]  Oh, the premier, those are curse words.
[3:39:06.620 --> 3:39:08.180]  Tell them to somebody, go screw yourself.
[3:39:08.180 --> 3:39:09.700]  I don't know if you're effing crap
[3:39:09.700 --> 3:39:11.780]  when they try to screw it your life.
[3:39:11.780 --> 3:39:13.500]  That's not profanity.
[3:39:13.500 --> 3:39:17.900]  That is proper language in that kind of situation.
[3:39:17.900 --> 3:39:20.620]  We got a freak show in front of us.
[3:39:20.620 --> 3:39:23.540]  Let it a little true dope, little true dope.
[3:39:23.540 --> 3:39:26.220]  A daddy's boy, a dad, or maybe a daddy's girl.
[3:39:26.220 --> 3:39:29.140]  Not so sure because, hey, you gotta be on both sides.
[3:39:29.140 --> 3:39:30.100]  Black and white.
[3:39:30.100 --> 3:39:33.260]  Yeah, you remember how he blackened his face up.
[3:39:33.260 --> 3:39:36.260]  A daddy's boy, a little nobody of a daddy's boy,
[3:39:36.260 --> 3:39:37.540]  telling us what to do.
[3:39:37.540 --> 3:39:39.300]  Going back to George Washington.
[3:39:40.820 --> 3:39:44.180]  He continues his argument by claiming that alliances
[3:39:44.180 --> 3:39:47.060]  are likely to draw the United States into wars
[3:39:47.060 --> 3:39:50.340]  that have no justification and no benefit to the country
[3:39:50.340 --> 3:39:54.260]  beyond simply defending the favored nations.
[3:39:54.260 --> 3:39:59.260]  Alliances, he warns, which lead to poor relations
[3:39:59.260 --> 3:40:02.700]  with nations who feel they are not being treated
[3:40:02.700 --> 3:40:05.780]  as well as American allies and threatened
[3:40:05.780 --> 3:40:07.900]  to influence the American government
[3:40:07.900 --> 3:40:12.500]  into making decisions based upon the will of their allies
[3:40:12.500 --> 3:40:16.880]  instead of the will of the American people.
[3:40:17.860 --> 3:40:22.860]  NATO, NATO, NATO's more important than America.
[3:40:23.580 --> 3:40:24.660]  What NATO?
[3:40:24.660 --> 3:40:29.660]  Why do we have 800 bases or 700 bases in 80 or 70 countries?
[3:40:31.500 --> 3:40:34.620]  Bring home the troops, secure the homeland.
[3:40:34.620 --> 3:40:38.340]  I'm driving out yesterday, a rotted, stinking infrastructure,
[3:40:38.340 --> 3:40:41.020]  hitting bumps everywhere I drive.
[3:40:42.340 --> 3:40:44.020]  The third world infrastructure,
[3:40:44.020 --> 3:40:47.480]  taking us subway in New York is a night in Calcutta.
[3:40:48.520 --> 3:40:50.180]  This is a time for peace.
[3:40:50.180 --> 3:40:52.880]  It's a time to celebrate Washington.
[3:40:53.980 --> 3:40:56.140]  Now what Washington has become,
[3:40:56.140 --> 3:40:59.540]  a bunch of arrogant little boys and girls.
[3:41:02.300 --> 3:41:04.580]  Washington goes on to urge American people
[3:41:04.580 --> 3:41:08.820]  to take advantage of their isolated position in the world
[3:41:08.820 --> 3:41:13.100]  and avoid attachments and entanglements in foreign affairs.
[3:41:13.100 --> 3:41:13.940]  You ready?
[3:41:13.940 --> 3:41:17.060]  Especially those of Europe,
[3:41:17.060 --> 3:41:21.620]  which he argues have little or nothing to do
[3:41:21.620 --> 3:41:23.480]  with the interests of America.
[3:41:24.460 --> 3:41:28.060]  Hey, all you fat mouth politicians,
[3:41:28.060 --> 3:41:30.660]  all you tough guys and girls,
[3:41:30.660 --> 3:41:34.420]  hey, look at the crime rates scoring all over America.
[3:41:34.420 --> 3:41:37.140]  Oh, and you're gonna win a war overseas.
[3:41:37.140 --> 3:41:40.700]  You losers haven't won a war since World War II.
[3:41:40.700 --> 3:41:44.780]  Oh, so empty, we only killed 3 million in Vietnam.
[3:41:44.780 --> 3:41:47.260]  We only poisoned a place with Agent Orange.
[3:41:47.260 --> 3:41:49.860]  If they allowed us to kill another 10 million,
[3:41:49.860 --> 3:41:50.940]  we were the one.
[3:41:50.940 --> 3:41:53.540]  And we only killed a million in Iraq.
[3:41:53.540 --> 3:41:56.940]  Great job in operation, enduring freedom.
[3:41:56.940 --> 3:41:58.860]  Brought to you by George W. Bush,
[3:41:58.860 --> 3:42:01.220]  the Afghan war, the longest war.
[3:42:01.220 --> 3:42:04.780]  Listen to what Washington said.
[3:42:04.780 --> 3:42:07.100]  This is Washington's day.
[3:42:07.100 --> 3:42:10.300]  This is a time for a revolution
[3:42:10.300 --> 3:42:14.780]  of freedom, peace, and justice, life, liberty,
[3:42:14.780 --> 3:42:16.740]  and the pursuit of happiness.
[3:42:17.700 --> 3:42:20.580]  That's how a declaration of independence
[3:42:20.580 --> 3:42:24.380]  that these low life garbage scum have stolen from us.
[3:42:24.380 --> 3:42:25.780]  Happiness, Salanti?
[3:42:25.780 --> 3:42:28.220]  Why, yeah, how dare you be happy?
[3:42:28.220 --> 3:42:31.140]  Get back in your house, shelter in place.
[3:42:31.140 --> 3:42:33.700]  I'm little Andy Cuomo, I'll tell you what to do.
[3:42:33.700 --> 3:42:35.980]  No, I'm Gavin Newsom, born on Third Base.
[3:42:35.980 --> 3:42:38.700]  Another arrogant boy, I'll tell you what to do.
[3:42:38.700 --> 3:42:41.700]  I'm Cotswone Macron, I'll tell you what to do.
[3:42:41.700 --> 3:42:44.940]  In a country near you, a freak is running it.
[3:42:44.940 --> 3:42:47.420]  Freedom has been robbed from us.
[3:42:47.420 --> 3:42:50.340]  We're gonna be back in a few and remember what I said.
[3:42:50.340 --> 3:42:54.100]  Support peace, freedom, and liberty, support infowars.
[3:42:56.540 --> 3:42:59.260]  I've been on air more than 25 years.
[3:42:59.260 --> 3:43:01.100]  And long before I started selling
[3:43:01.100 --> 3:43:04.300]  high quality vitamin D3 eight years ago,
[3:43:04.300 --> 3:43:08.020]  I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3
[3:43:08.020 --> 3:43:09.900]  because it is essential.

[3:43:12.900 --> 3:43:14.460]  whether you're black or white or Hispanic,
[3:43:14.460 --> 3:43:17.380]  it doesn't matter, your body will be susceptible

[3:46:05.740 --> 3:46:07.460]  you are getting enough in your system
[3:46:07.460 --> 3:46:09.620]  with a supplement that contains both.
[3:46:09.620 --> 3:46:12.740]  This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc
[3:46:12.740 --> 3:46:14.900]  with rose hips should be your next purchase
[3:46:14.900 --> 3:46:16.300]  from the InfoWars store.
[3:46:16.300 --> 3:46:18.580]  The rose hips contained within are a part
[3:46:18.580 --> 3:46:21.100]  of the rose flower just below the petals
[3:46:21.100 --> 3:46:23.500]  that contain the rose plant seeds.
[3:46:23.500 --> 3:46:25.780]  Natural chemicals found in the hips
[3:46:25.780 --> 3:46:28.740]  may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[3:46:28.740 --> 3:46:30.940]  including those with osteoarthritis
[3:46:30.940 --> 3:46:34.180]  and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[3:46:34.180 --> 3:46:36.380]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves,
[3:46:36.380 --> 3:46:38.180]  you probably already know that they play
[3:46:38.180 --> 3:46:41.060]  an important role in nutrition, immune defense
[3:46:41.060 --> 3:46:43.220]  and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[3:46:43.220 --> 3:46:45.380]  It has been reported that intake of both
[3:46:45.380 --> 3:46:48.500]  is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[3:46:48.500 --> 3:46:49.820]  like here in America.
[3:46:49.820 --> 3:46:51.900]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out

[3:47:00.100 --> 3:47:03.740]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:07.340 --> 3:47:11.180]  ["The Star-Spangled Banner"]
[3:47:11.180 --> 3:47:15.100]  ["The Star-Spangled Banner"]
[3:47:18.100 --> 3:47:21.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:47:21.420 --> 3:47:25.620]  and now your host Gerald Salente.

[3:47:54.660 --> 3:47:56.660]  and you get 40% off.
[3:47:56.660 --> 3:47:59.900]  But this is a limited supply
[3:47:59.900 --> 3:48:01.820]  and so it's gonna be a limited time offer
[3:48:01.820 --> 3:48:04.060]  and you see how this stuff goes so quickly.
[3:48:04.060 --> 3:48:05.580]  What brain force ultra does,
[3:48:05.580 --> 3:48:08.540]  it has more than twice the servings
[3:48:08.540 --> 3:48:12.060]  and even stronger proprietary super formulas
[3:48:12.060 --> 3:48:17.060]  including Guarani C, green coffee bean, green tea leaves
[3:48:18.020 --> 3:48:20.140]  and much, much, much, much more.
[3:48:20.140 --> 3:48:23.900]  So stop getting your energy from toxic sources
[3:48:23.900 --> 3:48:26.580]  and many energy drinks and other products
[3:48:26.580 --> 3:48:29.260]  that are loaded with artificial ingredients.
[3:48:29.260 --> 3:48:33.500]  Yeah, energy drinks, but the brain force ultra,
[3:48:33.500 --> 3:48:37.740]  it's a serious way and a serious source
[3:48:37.740 --> 3:48:39.220]  to find real energy
[3:48:40.380 --> 3:48:43.580]  and you could feel good about taking it every day.

[3:49:30.660 --> 3:49:34.540]  Yep, it's about building your brain power
[3:49:34.540 --> 3:49:37.060]  as they're sucking it out of us.
[3:49:41.740 --> 3:49:43.180]  Prestitute media.
[3:49:44.780 --> 3:49:46.460]  Now they sell war and hate.
[3:49:51.020 --> 3:49:54.460]  Speaking of war, Smedley Butler
[3:49:55.540 --> 3:49:58.900]  in his book, The Wars of Racket,
[3:50:00.140 --> 3:50:04.340]  this is one of the most decorated marine at the time
[3:50:04.340 --> 3:50:05.580]  in the United States.
[3:50:07.860 --> 3:50:10.360]  And then his book was a racket.
[3:50:11.780 --> 3:50:13.780]  I spent 33 years, he said,
[3:50:13.780 --> 3:50:17.060]  in four months in active military service.
[3:50:17.060 --> 3:50:19.500]  And during that period, I spent most of my time
[3:50:19.500 --> 3:50:22.500]  as a high class muscle man for big business.
[3:50:22.500 --> 3:50:24.020]  Sound familiar?
[3:50:24.020 --> 3:50:26.340]  It's called the military industrial complex.
[3:50:27.300 --> 3:50:29.500]  For Wall Street, yeah, no kidding.
[3:50:29.500 --> 3:50:34.580]  Oh, you mean the legendary investor Charlie Munger?
[3:50:36.620 --> 3:50:39.900]  For the bankers, yeah, the banksters,
[3:50:39.900 --> 3:50:42.980]  like the Goldman Chase and the JP Morgan's
[3:50:42.980 --> 3:50:46.060]  and the little Jamie Diamonds.
[3:50:46.060 --> 3:50:50.820]  Oh, they are the banksters that after Jesus Christ,
[3:50:50.820 --> 3:50:53.620]  the Prince of Peace drove them out of the temple.
[3:50:53.620 --> 3:50:58.340]  Three days later, he's on the cross, those bankers?
[3:50:58.340 --> 3:51:03.340]  In short, I was a racketeer against the capitalism.
[3:51:05.660 --> 3:51:07.380]  Corporatism.
[3:51:07.380 --> 3:51:10.060]  I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe
[3:51:10.060 --> 3:51:13.740]  for American oil interests in 1914.
[3:51:13.740 --> 3:51:16.420]  I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place
[3:51:16.420 --> 3:51:20.540]  for the national city bank boys to collect revenues in.
[3:51:20.540 --> 3:51:23.700]  I helped in the raping of a half dozen
[3:51:23.700 --> 3:51:27.180]  Central American republics to the benefit of Wall Street.
[3:51:28.180 --> 3:51:30.700]  I helped purify Nicaragua
[3:51:30.700 --> 3:51:34.660]  for the international banking house of Brown Brothers
[3:51:34.660 --> 3:51:37.220]  in 1902 in 1912.
[3:51:38.380 --> 3:51:41.060]  I brought light to the Dominican Republic
[3:51:41.060 --> 3:51:45.900]  for the American sugar interests in 1916.
[3:51:45.900 --> 3:51:50.900]  I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies
[3:51:51.540 --> 3:51:56.380]  in 1903 in China in 1927.
[3:51:56.380 --> 3:51:58.620]  I helped see it to it.
[3:51:58.620 --> 3:52:03.620]  That standard oil went on its way unmolested.
[3:52:03.900 --> 3:52:07.540]  Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone
[3:52:07.540 --> 3:52:09.340]  a few hints.
[3:52:09.340 --> 3:52:12.340]  The best he could do was to operate his racket
[3:52:12.340 --> 3:52:14.100]  in three districts.
[3:52:14.100 --> 3:52:16.700]  I operated in three continents.
[3:52:18.700 --> 3:52:21.340]  For great many years as a soldier,
[3:52:21.340 --> 3:52:24.340]  I had a suspicion that war was a racket.
[3:52:24.340 --> 3:52:28.820]  Not until I retired to civil life did I fully realize it.
[3:52:28.820 --> 3:52:32.660]  Now that I see the international war clouds gathering
[3:52:32.660 --> 3:52:37.660]  as they are today, I must face it and speak out
[3:52:37.900 --> 3:52:42.340]  and he writes this a few years before World War II.
[3:52:42.340 --> 3:52:44.340]  Got it?
[3:52:44.340 --> 3:52:48.340]  Earlier, one of the callers asked Alex,
[3:52:49.340 --> 3:52:52.340]  you know, after what they've done with us
[3:52:52.340 --> 3:52:56.340]  with this COVID thing, they're not gonna get away with it.
[3:52:56.340 --> 3:52:58.340]  But yes, they will.
[3:52:58.340 --> 3:53:00.340]  You go back to a couple of issues back
[3:53:00.340 --> 3:53:02.340]  of our trends journal.
[3:53:03.340 --> 3:53:06.340]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[3:53:06.340 --> 3:53:09.340]  Oh, people will forget about the COVID war.
[3:53:09.340 --> 3:53:11.340]  Now we got a big water fight.
[3:53:12.340 --> 3:53:13.340]  And will it affect us?
[3:53:13.340 --> 3:53:16.340]  Well, you know, if it becomes World War III,
[3:53:16.340 --> 3:53:19.340]  it'll be the war that they asked Einstein.
[3:53:19.340 --> 3:53:21.340]  What kind of weapons will be fought in World War III?
[3:53:21.340 --> 3:53:22.340]  He said, I don't know.
[3:53:22.340 --> 3:53:24.340]  He said, but they'll be using sticks and stones
[3:53:24.340 --> 3:53:26.340]  to fight the fourth.
[3:53:28.340 --> 3:53:30.340]  What you have to watch here are oil prices.
[3:53:30.340 --> 3:53:33.340]  And as Alex said before, oil prices were going up
[3:53:33.340 --> 3:53:35.340]  before this Ukraine thing happened.
[3:53:35.340 --> 3:53:39.340]  And again, never talking about peace,
[3:53:39.340 --> 3:53:42.340]  all they do is, this is how they're gonna threaten Russia
[3:53:42.340 --> 3:53:44.340]  if Russia does this or that.
[3:53:44.340 --> 3:53:46.340]  Oh, how about that little boy Sullivan?
[3:53:46.340 --> 3:53:47.340]  Again, a little boy.
[3:53:47.340 --> 3:53:48.340]  A little boy.
[3:53:48.340 --> 3:53:49.340]  What is it?
[3:53:49.340 --> 3:53:52.340]  He's a blabbermouth for one of the agencies,
[3:53:52.340 --> 3:53:54.340]  for the administration.
[3:53:54.340 --> 3:53:56.340]  I forget which one.
[3:53:57.340 --> 3:54:00.340]  Go back to your trends journal last week.
[3:54:00.340 --> 3:54:04.340]  You said evidence, good evidence.
[3:54:04.340 --> 3:54:07.340]  That's very highly likely that the Russians
[3:54:07.340 --> 3:54:10.340]  are going to attack before the end of the Olympics.
[3:54:10.340 --> 3:54:11.340]  That's right.
[3:54:11.340 --> 3:54:13.340]  Oh, the Olympics are over, aren't they?
[3:54:14.340 --> 3:54:18.340]  And again, people have no idea the history about Ukraine.
[3:54:18.340 --> 3:54:23.340]  It was only part of Russia for, you know, 200 years.
[3:54:25.340 --> 3:54:26.340]  And the story.
[3:54:26.340 --> 3:54:31.340]  You know, the story when Gorbachev came in,
[3:54:31.340 --> 3:54:33.340]  he put it back in, made it.
[3:54:33.340 --> 3:54:36.340]  And Crimea was always been part of Russia,
[3:54:36.340 --> 3:54:39.340]  you know, since the 1700s.
[3:54:39.340 --> 3:54:45.340]  And they had a vote, by the way, in Crimea.
[3:54:45.340 --> 3:54:48.340]  Russia didn't annex it.
[3:54:48.340 --> 3:54:52.340]  The vote was shown to be perfectly legal
[3:54:52.340 --> 3:54:54.340]  by international observers.
[3:54:54.340 --> 3:54:57.340]  Over 80% of the Crimeans came out and voted.
[3:54:57.340 --> 3:55:00.340]  They didn't want to become under the new dictatorship
[3:55:00.340 --> 3:55:02.340]  that the America put into Ukraine
[3:55:02.340 --> 3:55:06.340]  when they overthrew the government back in 2014.
[3:55:06.340 --> 3:55:09.340]  Over 95% of the Crimeans said,
[3:55:09.340 --> 3:55:16.340]  no, we're not going to join with Ukraine.
[3:55:16.340 --> 3:55:19.340]  We're staying on the Russian end.
[3:55:19.340 --> 3:55:30.340]  This is a quote from Victoria Newland.
[3:55:30.340 --> 3:55:36.340]  Victoria Newland was the Assistant Secretary of State
[3:55:36.340 --> 3:55:38.340]  for European Affairs.
[3:55:38.340 --> 3:55:44.340]  If you Google up Victoria Newland December,
[3:55:44.340 --> 3:55:52.340]  December, Victoria Newland December 2013,
[3:55:52.340 --> 3:55:55.340]  Washington, D.C., Ukraine.
[3:55:55.340 --> 3:55:57.340]  She's given a talk.
[3:55:57.340 --> 3:56:01.340]  The talk is brought to you by one end,
[3:56:01.340 --> 3:56:06.340]  Big Sign, Chevron, another one, ExxonMobil.
[3:56:06.340 --> 3:56:15.340]  Again, we wrote about it in detail in your Trends Journal
[3:56:15.340 --> 3:56:22.340]  back in September, excuse me, in the spring of 2014.
[3:56:22.340 --> 3:56:25.340]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts did a huge article in here
[3:56:25.340 --> 3:56:29.340]  about the overthrow of the Ukraine government.
[3:56:29.340 --> 3:56:33.340]  He goes on to say, Assistant Secretary of State,
[3:56:33.340 --> 3:56:36.340]  Newland boasted that Washington had invested
[3:56:36.340 --> 3:56:39.340]  $5 billion in non-governmental organizations.
[3:56:39.340 --> 3:56:42.340]  This is that the talk I was just talking about in Ukraine.
[3:56:42.340 --> 3:56:45.340]  The purpose of the NGOs is, quote,
[3:56:45.340 --> 3:56:50.340]  to teach democracy to Ukraine.
[3:56:50.340 --> 3:56:51.340]  And he goes on to say,
[3:56:51.340 --> 3:56:53.340]  however Ukraine had a democracy,
[3:56:53.340 --> 3:56:57.340]  Yanukovych was the President and they overthrew it.
[3:56:57.340 --> 3:57:01.340]  This is from your Trends Journal in September,
[3:57:01.340 --> 3:57:05.340]  excuse me, February 2015.
[3:57:05.340 --> 3:57:08.340]  In early February 2014,
[3:57:08.340 --> 3:57:11.340]  a recording was leaked to Assistant Secretary of State,
[3:57:11.340 --> 3:57:14.340]  Victoria Newland said to the ambassador
[3:57:14.340 --> 3:57:18.340]  that they were going to replace Ukrainian Victor Yanukovych
[3:57:18.340 --> 3:57:21.340]  with Yats, and they did.
[3:57:21.340 --> 3:57:23.340]  We're running out of time.
[3:57:23.340 --> 3:57:25.340]  It's all in your Trends Journal.
[3:57:25.340 --> 3:57:28.340]  History before it happens, there's no magazine like it.
[3:57:28.340 --> 3:57:31.340]  And she told the FU to go,
[3:57:31.340 --> 3:57:34.340]  she said to FU to the EU,
[3:57:34.340 --> 3:57:36.340]  and they were going to do what they wanted.
[3:57:36.340 --> 3:57:38.340]  This is not America.
[3:57:38.340 --> 3:57:41.340]  Not what Washington would like, or I like or you like.
[3:57:41.340 --> 3:58:00.340]  See you next week.
[3:58:11.340 --> 3:58:21.340]  I'm taking Dr. Jones' SORLESS.
[3:58:21.340 --> 3:58:23.340]  I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[3:58:23.340 --> 3:58:26.340]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support
[3:58:26.340 --> 3:58:28.340]  they need right now, plus inflammation support
[3:58:28.340 --> 3:58:30.340]  and extra flexibility.
[3:58:30.340 --> 3:58:33.340]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast
[3:58:33.340 --> 3:58:35.340]  so I can get back to the training.
[3:58:35.340 --> 3:58:38.340]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon,
[3:58:38.340 --> 3:58:41.340]  a turbo force that can still give you the energy
[3:58:41.340 --> 3:58:43.340]  and clarity you need for every day,
[3:58:43.340 --> 3:59:09.340]  can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[3:59:09.340 --> 3:59:18.340]  It's all crashing down.
[3:59:18.340 --> 3:59:20.340]  That's the survival instinct.
[3:59:20.340 --> 3:59:22.340]  But see, the worldly part of me that's still probably
[3:59:22.340 --> 3:59:24.340]  the majority part of me says, no, no, no, no.
[3:59:24.340 --> 3:59:26.340]  Stay in the city.
[3:59:26.340 --> 3:59:28.340]  The survival instinct says, get the hell out of anywhere
[3:59:28.340 --> 3:59:30.340]  that you ever know that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[3:59:30.340 --> 3:59:33.340]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is
[3:59:33.340 --> 3:59:37.340]  a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[3:59:37.340 --> 3:59:40.340]  But you can at least have some comfort
[3:59:40.340 --> 3:59:42.340]  if you have the emergency food supplies.
[3:59:42.340 --> 3:59:44.340]  And so we have the best ones at M4WareStore.com.
