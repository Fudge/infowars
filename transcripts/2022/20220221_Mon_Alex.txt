[00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:16.532]  The world is now in World War IV, and it's a global corporate war against humanity designed to have a controlled implosion of society to then carry out their endgame or their destination, their goal, 80 to 90% depopulation of the earth.
[00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:21.357]  Their official documents say 80 to 90% going back to the 60s.
[00:00:22.198 --> 00:00:28.215]   And these are the groups that created the Bilderberg Group, The CFR, the Trilateral Commission, it's all the same group.
[00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:34.257]  They're the capture, elite capture groups, the corporate capture groups that you know of as the Davos Group.
[00:00:34.277 --> 00:00:37.158]  The Davos Group is the main PR mouth.
[00:00:37.578 --> 00:00:41.300]  The CIA, and I think they're accurate when they say this, called the Cold War World War III.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.040]  A proxy war.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.541]  Millions died in the proxy wars.
[00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:53.964]  It was a long Cold War that would hybridize into Connecticut War, into kinetic war from time to time.
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:08.844]  But now we're going into World War 4 that is economic, that is psychological, that is cyber, that is radiological, that is electromagnetic, that is chemical, that is covert.
[00:01:09.765 --> 00:01:12.565]  Silent weapons for quiet wars.
[00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:13.646]  Just look these terms up.
[00:01:14.548 --> 00:01:28.513]  And it's what the globalists are obsessed with and they brag how you're done animals and they brag how they're going to annihilate you and how they're going to slowly take all your resources but make you love it while they brainwash you using Pavlovian behavioral psychology.
[00:01:28.553 --> 00:01:32.895]  These are the worst villains the earth has ever seen.
[00:01:33.314 --> 00:01:40.314]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:41.314 --> 00:01:45.314]  We're monitoring.
[00:01:45.632 --> 00:01:48.273]  We've learned from previous protests and demonstrations.
[00:01:48.293 --> 00:01:49.533]  We're monitoring the coverage.
[00:01:50.273 --> 00:01:54.114]  One of the tactics that the protesters and demonstrators are using is misinformation.
[00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:56.895]  Information that is inaccurate.
[00:01:57.455 --> 00:01:59.016]  Information that misleads the public.
[00:01:59.576 --> 00:02:07.258]  We're actively tweeting and providing information out through social media and other media mechanisms.
[00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:13.964]  The next step on the New World Order agenda is being normalized by Trudeau's unprecedented power grab.
[00:02:14.284 --> 00:02:16.486]  Canadians expect debate.
[00:02:17.246 --> 00:02:19.628]  Debate in service of all Canadians.
[00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:24.793]  Debate that is grounded in a shared acceptance of the facts.
[00:02:25.934 --> 00:02:37.874]   The federal government has invoked the Emergencies Act to supplement provincial and territorial capacity to address the blockades and occupations.
[00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:40.876]  I want to be very clear.
[00:02:41.877 --> 00:02:45.380]  The scope of these measures will be time-limited.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:54.187]  Now some of those tools, we will be putting forward measures to put those tools permanently in place.
[00:02:55.147 --> 00:03:05.577]  The scope of these measures will be time-limited, geographically targeted, as well as reasonable and proportionate.
[00:03:05.757 --> 00:03:15.527]  The Prime Minister and the Emergency Preparedness Minister have repeatedly stated that foreign extremist financing is behind Canadian protests.
[00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:25.730]  At Public Safety Committee last week, Deputy Director of Intelligence for FinTrack, Barry McKillop, stated that there is no evidence to back up these claims.
[00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:34.052]  In fact, he stated, quote, there has not been a spike in suspicious transactions related to the protest, end quote.
[00:03:34.112 --> 00:03:42.195]  Very soon, the graduates of tyranny will follow suit, creating an environment ripe for false flag order out of chaos.
[00:03:42.515 --> 00:03:49.940]  If you are involved in this protest, we will actively look to identify you and follow up with financial sanctions and criminal charges.
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.861]  Absolutely.
[00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:54.463]  This investigation will go on for months to come.
[00:03:54.603 --> 00:04:01.768]  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won't be able to stop himself from breaking up families and destroying their pets.
[00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:10.622]  A government that will kill your dog for simply disobeying their orders on a public demonstration will eventually have no issue killing you for the same.
[00:04:11.062 --> 00:04:12.762]  Trudeau is a fool and a tyrant.
[00:04:13.183 --> 00:04:18.424]  As Biden's January 6th gulag playbook will be repeated over the coming months.
[00:04:19.064 --> 00:04:26.487]  Violence has no place in our societies and extremists will not succeed in overruling the will of the people.
[00:04:27.487 --> 00:04:31.549]  As Canadians, I think we've been all reflecting on our own country.
[00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.290]  Something I spoke with the premiers about last night.
[00:04:35.251 --> 00:04:38.832]  About the fact that democracy is not automatic.
[00:04:39.592 --> 00:04:41.393]  It takes work every day.
[00:04:42.594 --> 00:04:56.380]  About what a real accomplishment it is to maintain a political system in which the losing side gracefully concedes and in which rival political parties between elections work together for the common good.
[00:04:57.557 --> 00:05:02.143]  We have this in Canada because Canadians make it possible.
[00:05:02.622 --> 00:05:04.622]  We love you!
[00:05:04.622 --> 00:05:06.622]  We love you!
[00:05:06.622 --> 00:05:08.622]  We love you!
[00:05:08.622 --> 00:05:15.622]   We're only allowing people that are residents or have a purpose to be in this area through.
[00:05:15.697 --> 00:05:16.898]  That's what I'm being told, yes.
[00:05:17.618 --> 00:05:20.380]  Okay, so this is essentially, uh, is this essentially a checkpoint?
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.783]  If you walk down that street... I'm being told not to talk to you guys anymore.
[00:05:25.183 --> 00:05:36.031]  We must always work to secure our democracy and not give comfort to those who promote things that are not true or give space for hatred or extremism.
[00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:37.851]  Canadians are to trust their government.
[00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:39.812]  Their government needs to trust Canadians.
[00:05:40.232 --> 00:05:42.633]  Those are the words of the Prime Minister in 2015.
[00:05:43.753 --> 00:05:50.254]  These people, very often misogynistic, racist, women haters, science deniers, the fringe.
[00:05:50.655 --> 00:05:57.136]  Same Prime Minister, six years later, as he fans the flames of an unjustified national emergency.
[00:05:57.156 --> 00:06:00.877]  Conservative party members can stand with people who wave swastikas.
[00:06:01.297 --> 00:06:04.118]  They can stand with people who wave the confederate flag.
[00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:10.102]  We will choose to stand with Canadians who deserve to be able to get to their jobs.
[00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:13.385]  The dictatorial pandemic has only just begun.
[00:06:13.565 --> 00:06:20.091]  Trudeau knows that he can rule at the discretion of the monarchy with no term limit in sight.
[00:06:20.411 --> 00:06:26.195]  But Section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom will eventually catch up to it.
[00:06:26.576 --> 00:06:27.777]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.661]  It's Monday.
[00:06:34.013 --> 00:06:37.094]  February 21st, 2022.
[00:06:38.214 --> 00:06:39.514]  And war is here.
[00:06:41.275 --> 00:06:45.156]  Ladies and gentlemen, what a time to be alive.
[00:06:45.216 --> 00:06:54.258]  What a time to be here talking directly to millions of you in defiance of the globalists and everything they've done to try to silence our pro-human movement that unifies the entire planet.
[00:06:55.937 --> 00:07:02.937]  and through free will hopefully with Christ finally.
[00:07:02.937 --> 00:07:12.057]   Russia has already been in an eight-year proxy war with the globalists
[00:07:11.012 --> 00:07:16.015]  And the West began to move heavy weapons in, in the last few years.
[00:07:17.416 --> 00:07:18.516]  They accelerated under Biden.
[00:07:19.877 --> 00:07:24.260]  And so Putin has put a bunch of troops on the border saying you need to not have them enter NATO.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.441]  You need to stop heavy weapons shipments.
[00:07:27.122 --> 00:07:33.386]  And we need to have a major armistice demilitarization ceasefire meeting.
[00:07:35.859 --> 00:07:39.340]  Under their Dinesk, if I pronounced that right, compact of several years ago.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:53.564]  In response to that, NATO and the West began to pump in even more weapons, anti-tank, anti-aircraft, where a two-man missile team can take out several tanks by themselves.
[00:07:55.384 --> 00:08:02.908]   And so Putin pulled back troops a few days ago and said, Give us a deal.
[00:08:03.868 --> 00:08:04.749]  We will not invade.
[00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:12.115]  And the response by Ukraine was to begin heavier attacks in eastern Ukraine on the Russian border.
[00:08:12.756 --> 00:08:14.057]  Both sides are shooting at each other.
[00:08:14.177 --> 00:08:15.338]  Both sides are killing each other.
[00:08:16.239 --> 00:08:25.206]  And I don't take a side of the quote Ukrainians or the Russians or any of this because when you pull back, you could argue both sides have issues with each other.
[00:08:26.067 --> 00:08:27.268]  But it's Russia's backyard.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:36.523]  And the globalists that are doing this are the ones that started it, and the ones that overthrew the elected Ukrainian government eight years ago.
[00:08:36.543 --> 00:08:38.064]  And it's been NATO that's been expanding.
[00:08:40.505 --> 00:08:51.169]  But nevertheless, here we are, and we have a headline that's going live here in just a few minutes that I was writing right before we went on air eight minutes ago, that they're adding a few videos and other links to.
[00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.231]  The great Ben Warren is adding to it.
[00:08:59.144 --> 00:09:04.186]  And then we are going to go over all of it, but here's the headline.
[00:09:05.367 --> 00:09:21.467]   The world is now in World War IV, and it's a global corporate war against humanity designed to have a controlled implosion of society to then carry out their endgame or their destination, their goal, 80-90% depopulation of the Earth.
[00:09:22.088 --> 00:09:26.290]  Their official documents say 80-90% going back to the 60s.
[00:09:27.111 --> 00:09:33.175]  And these are the groups that created the Bilderberg Group, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, it's all the same group.
[00:09:33.655 --> 00:09:39.199]  They're the capture, elite capture groups, the corporate capture groups that you know of as the Davos Group.
[00:09:39.219 --> 00:09:46.083]  The Davos Group is the main PR mouth of this, to use a Lord of the Rings analogy.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.081]  They're about to have the big battle.
[00:09:51.002 --> 00:09:52.143]  They're on the edge of Mordor.
[00:09:53.804 --> 00:09:55.245]  And the forces of the good guys are there.
[00:09:55.265 --> 00:09:59.848]  And the big black gate opens and out marches a undead general.
[00:09:59.868 --> 00:10:01.710]  And they say, are you Sauron?
[00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.011]  And he says, no, I am the mouth of Sauron.
[00:10:06.193 --> 00:10:09.495]  And that's what Klaus Schwab is, is the mouth of Sauron.
[00:10:11.576 --> 00:10:15.379]  And above him is one of the top Ringwraiths.
[00:10:16.843 --> 00:10:17.584]  Larry Fink.
[00:10:20.366 --> 00:10:21.867]  And then above that, of course, is the devil.
[00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:56.581]   And you could watch hundreds of hours, we play a lot of the clips, of Larry Fink and Klaus Schwab and all their minions on television, at conferences, sitting around arrogantly in their $10,000 suits, wearing their $100,000 rich watches, flying in on their $50 million private jets, Telling you that they're going to discredit governments worldwide and collapse them with their corporate takeover plan to give you everything free and deliver you to a utopia.
[00:11:00.063 --> 00:11:05.248]  Later in the broadcast, I've got a bunch of clips together, some I got to yesterday, more I even got last night this morning.
[00:11:06.268 --> 00:11:10.792]  Because I've seen most of these clips over the years, but now Twitter and Instagram and everywhere is on fire with it.
[00:11:11.072 --> 00:11:12.974]  So friends, family are sending it to me.
[00:11:13.732 --> 00:11:14.773]  Cousins are sending it to me.
[00:11:14.793 --> 00:11:15.614]  They aren't even political.
[00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:21.178]  It's incredible the awakening curve that's happening right now.
[00:11:21.198 --> 00:11:24.821]  And of course, Joe Rogan is now talking about Great Reset and Great Detail.
[00:11:26.182 --> 00:11:27.202]  It's a wonderful thing.
[00:11:28.163 --> 00:11:29.724]  So is Tucker Carlson and so many others.
[00:11:29.764 --> 00:11:38.011]  And that's thanks to all of you getting the word out and making it safer for other people to now be able to get into it because it's become more mainstream.
[00:11:39.272 --> 00:11:44.418]  And so it's a big moment for all of us here, because here's the bottom line, as I say every show.
[00:11:45.779 --> 00:11:53.168]  I could have way more, quote, entertaining broadcast and cover more interesting topics and things that at the end of the day don't really matter, but are very interesting.
[00:11:53.628 --> 00:11:55.070]  Or I can just hammer.
[00:11:56.178 --> 00:12:03.223]  That if we don't identify who's running World War 4, or why I call it World War 4, and who they are and what their goals are, we don't have any hope.
[00:12:03.684 --> 00:12:09.288]  But if we just identify these monsters, they will get the blame for everything they're doing, and they will go to prison.
[00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:09.988]  They will stop.
[00:12:10.549 --> 00:12:13.291]  They will end up like Bernie Madoff and the rest of his family.
[00:12:13.831 --> 00:12:15.673]  Because it's the exact same type of ilk.
[00:12:16.213 --> 00:12:27.935]   They've just built bigger Ponzi schemes and hope worldwide martial law and germophobia will allow them to get greater control out of them steering humanity into a Firestorm!
[00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:37.159]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, we are in World War 4 right now.
[00:12:37.479 --> 00:12:40.900]  The CIA, and I think they're accurate when they say this, called the Cold War World War 3.
[00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:42.921]  A proxy war.
[00:12:43.401 --> 00:12:45.422]  Millions died in the proxy wars.
[00:12:45.882 --> 00:12:53.845]  It was a long Cold War that would hybridize into Connecticut War, into kinetic war from time to time.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:08.729]  But now, we're going into World War IV that is economic, that is psychological, that is cyber, that is radiological, that is electromagnetic, that is chemical, that is covert.
[00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:15.714]  Silent weapons, silent weapons for quiet wars.
[00:13:17.736 --> 00:13:20.538]  Silent weapons for quiet wars.
[00:13:20.598 --> 00:13:21.639]  Just look these terms up.
[00:13:22.518 --> 00:13:36.470]  And it's what the globalists are obsessed with, and they brag how you're dumb animals, and they brag how they're going to annihilate you, and how they're going to slowly take all your resources, but make you love it while they brainwash you using Pavlovian behavioral psychology.
[00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.854]  These are the worst villains the earth has ever seen.
[00:13:43.516 --> 00:13:52.629]   And their endgame Before they carry out their final solution of forced depopulation is a digital ID that you must have to buy and sell.
[00:13:52.910 --> 00:14:10.283]  And that's why one of the board members of Klaus Schwab's organization, the Dabos Group, that is the public arm of the Bilderberg Group, literally, he's the former head of the Bilderberg Group, states that, oh, now the system to track what you buy and what you do in live time is permanent.
[00:14:10.363 --> 00:14:13.486]  And then she lists a UN Klaus Schwab program.
[00:14:14.923 --> 00:14:20.025]  So just a week ago, the emergency in Canada's only for a few weeks.
[00:14:20.085 --> 00:14:20.925]  Now it's permanent.
[00:14:21.545 --> 00:14:33.410]  And now from China to Germany to the U.S., Biden and the other globalists are announcing, oh, we're going to watch everything you do in live time on your computer or on your bank account or with your credit cards.
[00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.631]  And we're going to give it to third party intelligence groups.
[00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:41.253]  She says that to the press and the NGOs, the Southern Property Law Center.
[00:14:42.133 --> 00:14:55.497]  The ADL, Hope Not Hate, all these designate groups that go and train the police and train the colleges in political correctness, they're now not just spying on your Twitter or your Facebook account, they're now in your bank.
[00:14:57.578 --> 00:14:59.038]  Total criminal takeover.
[00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:06.881]  The ADL admits that they have supercomputers spying on what all Americans post and stay in live time and building databases.
[00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:09.622]  And that's it.
[00:15:09.702 --> 00:15:10.482]  It's very, very simple.
[00:15:11.462 --> 00:15:14.064]  You have an authoritarian, fascistic, corporate system.
[00:15:15.085 --> 00:15:17.627]  Larry Fink merged with the Communist Chinese.
[00:15:17.647 --> 00:15:19.108]  No one even debates that.
[00:15:19.428 --> 00:15:21.931]  Helping run the biggest death camps in history.
[00:15:22.831 --> 00:15:26.134]  And he sits up there and lectures you about Black Lives Matter and how America's bad.
[00:15:26.554 --> 00:15:29.096]  And running BlackRock, he controls the Bilderberg Group.
[00:15:30.077 --> 00:15:34.661]  And he sits up there and perches with several members in the video of Trudeau's cabinet.
[00:15:35.962 --> 00:15:45.516]  Talking about how they're going to destroy all the governments in the world, take them over, and put us all on a universal basic income, and control every facet of our lives, including our children's sexuality.
[00:15:45.876 --> 00:15:48.901]  These people are the definition of satanic.
[00:15:49.862 --> 00:15:51.004]  The definition of evil.
[00:15:51.064 --> 00:15:52.266]  The definition of our enemies.
[00:15:53.135 --> 00:15:55.598]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you what's coming up today.
[00:15:55.919 --> 00:16:01.767]  We're also going to have open phones in the second and third hour, and then Joel Celente takes over head of the War Room at 3 p.m.
[00:16:01.807 --> 00:16:02.167]  Central.
[00:16:02.608 --> 00:16:04.951]  This is the Alex Jones Show that you're tuned in to right now.
[00:16:05.432 --> 00:16:06.693]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:16:06.753 --> 00:16:15.598]   If you're a new listener, Especially please research and check out the claims we make and find out it's true for yourself so that you understand you've been lied to by the establishment.
[00:16:16.098 --> 00:16:26.842]  And once you know that we're telling you the truth, we hope you'll take matters into your own hands peacefully and share the articles and videos and live feeds from this transmission and other transmissions that are telling the truth.
[00:16:27.923 --> 00:16:28.223]  All right.
[00:16:29.343 --> 00:16:34.565]  Everybody's really freaking out about California, but it's happening all over the U.S., including Texas.
[00:16:34.585 --> 00:16:35.846]  It's happening here in Austin.
[00:16:37.366 --> 00:17:01.419]  This hasn't broke yet, but we have the documents, where they pay elementary school students, middle school students, and high school students to go have sex education in government-run dormitories and cabins where adults sleep with them, including biological males with little girls.
[00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:06.122]  And California is now defending this.
[00:17:08.823 --> 00:17:10.604]  We're going to be getting to all of it coming up.
[00:17:11.344 --> 00:17:13.285]  Marjorie Taylor Greene was in the studio with us last night.
[00:17:13.345 --> 00:17:14.185]  She talked about it.
[00:17:15.505 --> 00:17:25.549]  We filed a report that's now live with the local newscasts out of California and MTG on InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:31.851]  Breaking MTG responds to biological men sleeping with elementary school girls at state-sponsored camp.
[00:17:33.372 --> 00:17:36.213]  But they say it's okay because they call themselves transgender.
[00:17:37.452 --> 00:17:42.635]  Just like it's okay for men to go to female prisons and get women pregnant and they say two women had a baby.
[00:17:43.916 --> 00:17:44.596]  That's coming up.
[00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.399]  Last segment of the shower.
[00:17:49.719 --> 00:17:54.382]  And I'm going to tie it all together and what it's really all about and where it's all going because now it's official.
[00:17:55.103 --> 00:17:56.463]  These people are taking over sports.
[00:17:57.184 --> 00:17:58.885]  They're taking over the schools.
[00:17:59.365 --> 00:18:03.648]  They're taking over every single facet of life.
[00:18:06.952 --> 00:18:11.535]  In the world, and they are capturing our children, literally.
[00:18:13.156 --> 00:18:34.188]  Then, of course, we have massive martial law news around the world under the COVID tyranny and the latest on COVID-19, where the CDC just admitted, because they know it's coming out in federal court filings, that they knew the vaccine didn't work, but, quote, didn't want to tell the public because they didn't want us to know it didn't work.
[00:18:35.876 --> 00:18:42.160]  And because quote, they didn't want to cause vaccine hesitancy for something that doesn't work.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:48.124]  It's like selling somebody a canoe with a big hole in it and saying, well, I don't want to, you know, tell them it's got a hole in it.
[00:18:48.524 --> 00:18:49.605]  I'll put a sticker over it.
[00:18:49.965 --> 00:18:51.566]  And when they get out in the water, they're going to sink.
[00:18:52.847 --> 00:18:55.829]  It just shows the criminal activity here that they know it's all coming out.
[00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:57.209]  So now they want to cover the rest.
[00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:02.953]  Oh, and the British government's now saying we knew lockdowns didn't work and cause massive death and suicide.
[00:19:03.473 --> 00:19:04.194]  We're sorry.
[00:19:07.205 --> 00:19:08.765]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[00:19:09.846 --> 00:19:12.086]  So we're going to be breaking all that down just over the top.
[00:19:12.146 --> 00:19:25.030]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, we probably not exaggerating, got 20 clips of police beating women and men and putting them in the hospital who get out of their truck, put their hands up peacefully.
[00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:34.012]  And then the police literally break their ribs by jumping up and down on them and stomping them and hitting them with rifle butts as hard as they can.
[00:19:35.965 --> 00:19:45.391]  And arresting old people, and dragging everyone away, and just unbelievable criminal activity right out of North Korea.
[00:19:45.431 --> 00:19:46.251]  That's all coming up.
[00:19:46.511 --> 00:19:54.156]  And then, I've seen now some Davos Group clips that I've never seen, and I thought I'd seen them all.
[00:19:55.497 --> 00:19:58.719]  Now the public, human intelligence, is going out and digging through.
[00:20:01.035 --> 00:20:04.357]  The globalist statements and organizations, it's even worse than I thought.
[00:20:04.397 --> 00:20:07.840]  I mean, they're just up there making criminal admissions that boggle the mind.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.943]  So in between your calls, in the second and third hour, every segment will play a few clips.
[00:20:12.363 --> 00:20:13.744]  And maybe get through the 40 or so.
[00:20:13.784 --> 00:20:16.326]  Because I got 20 plus I didn't get to yesterday out of 30.
[00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:18.647]  And I got 20 plus today.
[00:20:19.888 --> 00:20:21.249]  Each one more insane than the last.
[00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.830]  In their words.
[00:20:23.491 --> 00:20:27.874]  And then members of Parliament and others trying to talk about it and having their mics cut off.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:36.083]  And the Speaker of the Parliament has an operative step and say, that's not allowed!
[00:20:36.163 --> 00:20:36.823]  Disinformation!
[00:20:37.544 --> 00:20:42.226]  So see, it's not just live time censorship on Google and Twitter and Facebook and Trump's ban and all this stuff.
[00:20:43.987 --> 00:20:44.628]  Now it's everything.
[00:20:44.688 --> 00:20:46.449]  Oh, and speaking of that, got contacted.
[00:20:47.318 --> 00:20:53.924]  But the nice folks over at True Social last week, they asked me to go sign up, gave me a VIP access and I got busy and didn't do it.
[00:20:54.624 --> 00:20:56.326]  I'm trying to sign up during the breaks right now.
[00:20:56.426 --> 00:20:59.709]  I'm not the most technical person because it's like a beta test deal.
[00:20:59.729 --> 00:21:02.211]  You got to go through this portal.
[00:21:03.152 --> 00:21:04.313]  But that's big news.
[00:21:04.533 --> 00:21:07.656]  And so we're going to be posting on there hopefully today.
[00:21:08.076 --> 00:21:13.481]  Trump launches social media network and they didn't they're not censoring us and stuff.
[00:21:13.501 --> 00:21:14.202]  So that's that's good.
[00:21:15.162 --> 00:21:17.383]  Of course, the left is going to post a bunch of trash and say it's censored.
[00:21:17.403 --> 00:21:18.344]  You can't post porn.
[00:21:18.584 --> 00:21:20.305]  You can't have calls to criminal action.
[00:21:20.645 --> 00:21:23.967]  That's the normal Internet rules that made sense previous to five, six years ago.
[00:21:24.387 --> 00:21:27.588]  So basically, this just takes you back in a time machine five, six years.
[00:21:28.069 --> 00:21:29.590]  I've seen friends and others that have it now.
[00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.391]  Talk show hosts have shown to me that have visited.
[00:21:33.972 --> 00:21:34.932]  It works pretty good.
[00:21:35.052 --> 00:21:37.914]  It looks about what the Internet looked like five years ago.
[00:21:39.011 --> 00:21:39.792]  Which is fine with me.
[00:21:41.213 --> 00:21:45.436]  Just go back to when there was some basic freedom on it, and it works about like that too.
[00:21:45.456 --> 00:21:52.041]  And I'm sure they'll work some of the bugs out, and I'm glad to see that having a successful launch so far.
[00:21:54.163 --> 00:21:56.044]  Now, here's something I'm just going to say.
[00:21:57.085 --> 00:22:04.911]  There's a lot of personal stuff that's been happening to InfoWars behind the scenes that you don't know about, and I've meant for about a month to just come on air and tell you about all of it.
[00:22:07.461 --> 00:22:09.763]  And it's not that I'm even embarrassed about all this stuff.
[00:22:11.744 --> 00:22:26.214]  It's more like it's just so complex and there's so much of it and it's so crazy that every time I get ready to talk about it, new stuff has happened and it's just unbelievable.
[00:22:27.435 --> 00:22:34.040]  And it's what's coming for you and your family under the dictatorship of BlackRock and the Bilderberg Group and the Davos Group and the New World Order.
[00:22:34.921 --> 00:22:42.156]   But There has to come a time when you just spell out the facts to people.
[00:22:43.037 --> 00:22:45.538]  And we don't have extra money.
[00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:48.298]  We don't have extra assets to speak of.
[00:22:49.299 --> 00:22:55.000]  And we don't have the hundreds of millions of dollars that the Democratic Party law firms say we do.
[00:22:56.661 --> 00:22:57.261]  And they know that.
[00:22:58.341 --> 00:23:01.362]  The judges ordered everything to be given to them as a roadmap to destroy us.
[00:23:01.863 --> 00:23:04.763]  And even when they found out we don't have anything, they're like, well, we don't care.
[00:23:04.803 --> 00:23:06.424]  We want to just silence you and shut you down.
[00:23:07.091 --> 00:23:09.814]  Now, this operation could be shut down very soon.
[00:23:10.275 --> 00:23:13.238]  We'll be able to pop back up, do my show, all of it.
[00:23:13.658 --> 00:23:16.241]  I won't be able to personally have as much money.
[00:23:16.421 --> 00:23:17.102]  I don't care about it.
[00:23:17.142 --> 00:23:18.944]  In fact, it's good to have less stuff.
[00:23:19.885 --> 00:23:24.170]  I told you I've got a trailer out in the beautiful woods, and I'm moving into the trailer.
[00:23:25.612 --> 00:23:26.513]  And I don't even own the trailer.
[00:23:31.204 --> 00:23:37.487]  All this crap means nothing to me, but staying in the fight does and trying to keep all this great crew together does.
[00:23:38.567 --> 00:23:43.389]  But I just want you to know this country and the world's in a lot of trouble and I think you know now I've not been exaggerating all these years.
[00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:49.492]  We're in really bad trouble and we're a symbol of America and your speech and freedom and we are under attack.
[00:23:49.792 --> 00:24:12.337]   So I'd ask you all to pray for Infowars and I'd ask you to financially support us because as much funds as we can get in, And bolster what we're doing, then we can have something for our defense and something to prolong as long as possible us being on air and this permutation before we launch all the other things that are out there that other people have built and other people own.
[00:24:12.837 --> 00:24:14.199]  That way they can't shut that down.
[00:24:15.179 --> 00:24:44.328]   Show I'll literally be like the warrior priest that like Obi-Wan Kenobi has nothing but has a giant platform and reaches more people than ever These people thought I'd back down over money You have done nothing but energize me to the next level Here we are on this Monday February 21st global transmission and of the wonderful crew can put that headline back on screen I'm gonna read it to people World War four Has begun.
[00:24:45.088 --> 00:24:57.938]  Powerful global corporations have set in motion a plan for world domination and complete enslavement of humanity.
[00:25:02.742 --> 00:25:03.943]  And they can read the sub-headlines.
[00:25:08.026 --> 00:25:15.514]   A consortium of megacorporations working through the World Economic Forum I've initiated a controlled demolition of the world economy.
[00:25:16.494 --> 00:25:28.963]  Only by being aware of the plan, the Great Reset, can we stop their endgame of the destruction of 90% of Earth's population, known as the Build Back Better operation.
[00:25:31.725 --> 00:25:33.566]  Today's broadcast is huge and important.
[00:25:35.187 --> 00:25:36.989]  And that's what it comes down to, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:38.730]  I wrote that quickly before I went live on air.
[00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:41.672]  We probably just add a plan, set in motion the plan.
[00:25:42.938 --> 00:25:43.419]  The plan.
[00:25:43.479 --> 00:25:43.920]  A plan.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:44.721]  It's their plan.
[00:25:46.003 --> 00:25:47.165]  Set in motion their plan.
[00:25:50.451 --> 00:25:54.517]  And folks are going to find out real fast that we're not joking around about any of this.
[00:25:55.566 --> 00:26:12.991]  I understand people 25 years ago heard me talk about it, but you know I was told all this by senior FBI agents, senior Pentagon generals, senior people that have worked for the CIA, all senior people told me this when I was very young and then when I got politically involved.
[00:26:13.671 --> 00:26:15.372]  And that's just the way the world works, folks.
[00:26:15.392 --> 00:26:28.885]   You can go read the books written by these people and there's been a massive resistance in America And in Europe and in England, but also in other areas against this big global takeover, this elite capture.
[00:26:30.125 --> 00:26:37.266]  Klaus Schwab didn't invent going and taking over and buying off politicians and leaders or running people for office who are in a cult.
[00:26:39.307 --> 00:26:50.349]  But through the Bilderberg Group and other organizations, he set up one of the most successful launches in the 70s, was the beta test, the official launch in 1991.
[00:26:52.262 --> 00:27:02.705]  Of a Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, CFR, Royal Institute of International Affairs, Roundtable Groups is what Cecil Rhodes called them 120 years ago.
[00:27:03.445 --> 00:27:05.205]  The guy that created the modern British Empire.
[00:27:05.225 --> 00:27:07.206]  You might want to read his books, I have.
[00:27:07.586 --> 00:27:08.326]  Pretty powerful stuff.
[00:27:08.526 --> 00:27:09.487]  It's all written there.
[00:27:10.107 --> 00:27:10.767]  It's all there.
[00:27:12.366 --> 00:27:22.725]   And the problem was in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, there were mainly military officers
[00:27:22.725 --> 00:27:28.646]   and former intelligence officers and FBI agents and former agents, retirees that fought this.
[00:27:28.707 --> 00:27:33.209]  I mean, because we demonize the FBI all day and these agencies because they're captured by the globalists at the top.
[00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:34.950]  But when I was growing up...
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:43.105]  It was FBI agents and people would come over and play chess with my dad and drink scotch and just talk about it.
[00:27:43.125 --> 00:27:56.456]  From the time I was like four years old, right through I moved out of the house, my dad's friends were all businessmen and engineers and scientists and FBI agents and federal marshals and all these people that knew what was going on and they all just knew this.
[00:27:56.696 --> 00:28:00.039]  To them it wasn't their opinion, they knew how the world worked.
[00:28:00.059 --> 00:28:05.223]  Hell, Barry Goldwater back in the 60s and 70s had hearings and talked about everything that's now happened.
[00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:08.160]  He almost became president!
[00:28:10.241 --> 00:28:11.581]  They probably would have assassinated him, though.
[00:28:13.042 --> 00:28:17.244]  So, what I'm trying to explain to you is what I'm telling you has been known forever.
[00:28:19.285 --> 00:28:23.488]  British intelligence in 1921 set up Pratt House in New York City.
[00:28:26.769 --> 00:28:32.512]  And they set it up to buy off the New York elite and have a merger of the British Empire with the new American Empire.
[00:28:32.812 --> 00:28:43.286]   And that was done by World War II and Winston Churchill wrote three books called The Histories of the English-Speaking Peoples.
[00:28:43.806 --> 00:28:47.008]  And by the third book, and I, by the way, read the books, they're riveting.
[00:28:47.028 --> 00:28:49.110]  In fact, I couldn't find them.
[00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:51.511]  I was looking for them, I guess, when I moved five, six years ago.
[00:28:51.531 --> 00:28:52.492]  They're in storage somewhere.
[00:28:53.973 --> 00:28:55.214]  I've got original volumes.
[00:28:56.655 --> 00:28:58.876]  Each one's about 500, 600 pages long.
[00:29:00.297 --> 00:29:01.198]  Big old hardcovers.
[00:29:01.858 --> 00:29:04.760]  And he admits it all in there, but says it's a great thing.
[00:29:06.192 --> 00:29:11.201]  Well, yeah, if it actually promoted freedom and Western ideas, but that's not what it's doing.
[00:29:12.644 --> 00:29:19.376]  It's promoting evil, ladies and gentlemen, and they have captured our governments, they have captured the infrastructure.
[00:29:21.028 --> 00:29:22.929]  And they've captured the agencies.
[00:29:23.409 --> 00:29:25.670]  And that's why I told you the Q thing was pure bull.
[00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:33.393]  Because at the top of the FBI, and the top of the NSA, and the top of the CIA, and the top of these courts, is predominantly bad people.
[00:29:34.073 --> 00:29:35.654]  They haven't gotten rid of all the good people.
[00:29:35.674 --> 00:29:37.234]  There are some good Supreme Court justices.
[00:29:37.514 --> 00:29:38.775]  There are some good federal judges.
[00:29:40.095 --> 00:29:53.557]   But they are very close worldwide in controlling just the DeVos group, has over a hundred presidents, prime ministers, of countries in their control.
[00:29:53.557 --> 00:30:00.957]   And I tried to get the numbers on governors and premiers, which is governors in most areas, and regional leaders.
[00:30:00.957 --> 00:30:12.856]   And it's around half of the governors of the Western world or premiers are under their control.
[00:30:12.856 --> 00:30:15.457]  There's more than 50 members of Congress.
[00:30:15.457 --> 00:30:17.057]  And here's what's scary.
[00:30:17.147 --> 00:30:23.811]  Almost all the new Democrats running and a bunch of Republicans, they're so used to they had some, now it's almost all.
[00:30:24.871 --> 00:30:25.552]  They're involved.
[00:30:25.592 --> 00:30:26.672]  You think stuff's bad now?
[00:30:27.793 --> 00:30:31.755]  Man, they're about to have their people in control of everything.
[00:30:33.556 --> 00:30:33.896]  Everything.
[00:30:38.259 --> 00:30:38.619]  Everything.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.841]  You think that's a good thing, folks?
[00:30:41.881 --> 00:30:45.203]  You think you want to live under Larry Fink's control?
[00:30:48.271 --> 00:30:51.493]  Who defends literal slave camps and death camps in China.
[00:30:53.634 --> 00:30:59.737]  That corporate attitude you see from the owner of the Warriors basketball team saying, I don't even think about the millions of people in death camps.
[00:30:59.757 --> 00:31:01.618]  They don't even register in my mind.
[00:31:01.658 --> 00:31:03.218]  They don't even enter my mind.
[00:31:03.238 --> 00:31:06.220]  Because you have a more evil statement.
[00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:09.071]  They don't even register.
[00:31:09.111 --> 00:31:10.071]  They're beneath me.
[00:31:10.651 --> 00:31:13.192]  Oh, Marie Antoinette, the French are starving.
[00:31:13.232 --> 00:31:14.073]  The people are starving.
[00:31:14.193 --> 00:31:14.993]  Open the granary.
[00:31:15.553 --> 00:31:18.514]  Give them some food or they're going to storm the palace and kill us.
[00:31:19.215 --> 00:31:21.255]  And she reportedly said, let them eat cake.
[00:31:22.516 --> 00:31:23.796]  And then it got stormed.
[00:31:24.677 --> 00:31:30.479]  The Bastille, the prison and the guard facility of the corrupt police that was guarding the palace.
[00:31:30.559 --> 00:31:32.940]  And within a couple of days, they all had their heads chopped off.
[00:31:35.976 --> 00:31:37.958]  Now did she really say let them eat cake?
[00:31:38.239 --> 00:31:43.585]  Or did somebody go tell them that when they were begging for food and those children were starving to death?
[00:31:44.225 --> 00:31:45.687]  Or was it made up?
[00:31:45.827 --> 00:31:46.588]  No one knows.
[00:31:47.329 --> 00:31:54.329]   But we do know in modern times Larry Fink sits up there and says, the people are poor, the middle class has been erased.
[00:31:54.609 --> 00:32:00.351]  We must fix it by taking over these corrupt governments and bringing in a system that gives people a basic income.
[00:32:00.711 --> 00:32:13.855]  When they're the ones making sure that the social safety net is broken and the small businesses are shut down and their lockdowns doubled their profits and destroyed the infrastructure of the economy, they're the ones that go out of their way to destroy U.S.
[00:32:13.895 --> 00:32:14.876]  companies and U.S.
[00:32:14.896 --> 00:32:15.516]  corporations.
[00:32:19.147 --> 00:32:30.474]  And then Larry Fink sits up there with Chamath Palahapatiya and says, nobody cares about the death camps and the genocide.
[00:32:31.155 --> 00:32:32.135]  And that's liberal.
[00:32:34.377 --> 00:32:42.862]  And Klaus Schwab and Larry Fink and all of them go, things are about to get real bad.
[00:32:43.282 --> 00:32:47.305]  And when they do, we're going to overthrow all the governments and put our corporate rule in.
[00:32:48.268 --> 00:32:52.151]  And then they release the virus, shut everything down, trigger the operation.
[00:32:52.171 --> 00:32:58.016]  They're all on video saying, we need a catalyst to make them accept us as their saviors.
[00:33:00.498 --> 00:33:03.581]  And then they talk about, well, maybe a virus will do it.
[00:33:04.822 --> 00:33:07.884]  And then they go, well, maybe a cyber attack, maybe a war.
[00:33:08.065 --> 00:33:10.707]  And they're in there on all three points of that.
[00:33:12.548 --> 00:33:13.769]  Behind it, on record.
[00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:18.274]   I mean, you're watching Yeah, there's Trudeau giving Larry Fink an award.
[00:33:19.355 --> 00:33:21.477]  And they wear a rainbow swastika.
[00:33:22.138 --> 00:33:25.460]  That's the symbol of Build Back Better, is a rainbow swastika.
[00:33:26.681 --> 00:33:27.582]  That's what he was pinning on him.
[00:33:30.104 --> 00:33:40.733]  I mean, God help us, it's an organized crime group, a mega-bank with quadrillions of stolen money, makes Bernie Mandoff look like an angel, making a move on us through criminals, they put in positions of power everywhere.
[00:33:41.113 --> 00:33:42.514]  And now they're starting a war with Russia.
[00:33:43.815 --> 00:33:45.977]  They're at war with God, folks, that's why.
[00:33:46.966 --> 00:33:48.870]  Alright, it's the final segment of the first hour.
[00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.935]  I intend to open the phones up the second and third hour today.
[00:33:51.955 --> 00:33:53.659]  And as promised...
[00:33:54.946 --> 00:33:57.789]  In the month of March, I'm going to start doing three shows a week.
[00:33:58.309 --> 00:34:03.634]  They're at least two hours apiece, where they're commercial-free, and we take phone calls and have special guests.
[00:34:04.355 --> 00:34:06.978]  I did it on Saturday for about two hours and 15 minutes.
[00:34:07.478 --> 00:34:10.521]  Came in, of course, we had four hours last night with MTG and Owen Schroyer.
[00:34:11.502 --> 00:34:14.905]  But in these critical times, every day is precious, every day is special.
[00:34:15.366 --> 00:34:19.310]  And there's nothing I like better than grilling hamburgers on my backyard.
[00:34:20.646 --> 00:34:28.830]  Watching my four-year-old daughter play in her sandbox and play with model airplanes and blow bubbles and act silly and watch cartoons.
[00:34:31.731 --> 00:34:35.553]  But she doesn't have a future if I don't fight as hard as I can.
[00:34:38.015 --> 00:34:42.737]  And that's why I need all of you to fight as hard as you can as well, because we need to save my daughter.
[00:34:43.237 --> 00:34:45.558]  We need to save your sons and daughters as well, and we're going to do it.
[00:34:46.018 --> 00:34:46.779]  We need to man up.
[00:34:48.257 --> 00:34:48.998]  We need to do what's right.
[00:34:49.018 --> 00:34:50.439]  And that's why I salute the truckers.
[00:34:52.121 --> 00:34:55.565]  You know, it's hard to even cover the truckers around the world and how great they are.
[00:34:56.786 --> 00:35:00.950]  And how they stepped up as hardworking people that live in the real world.
[00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:05.695]  And it's hard for me to even cover it because I feel like I'm not going to do it justice.
[00:35:06.115 --> 00:35:07.997]  You know, maybe we just shouldn't take calls today.
[00:35:08.017 --> 00:35:09.379]  And I'm not just saying that for an effect.
[00:35:09.419 --> 00:35:10.340]  I'm thinking about it right now.
[00:35:12.054 --> 00:35:20.041]  And just play the Davos group admitting they've conquered us and how they want to turn our power off and enslave us and how they want to depopulate us and just all their evil.
[00:35:21.302 --> 00:35:28.708]  Maybe we should just cover that, play the clips, and then cover what's happened to the truckers in New Zealand and Australia and Canada.
[00:35:30.066 --> 00:35:33.848]  And I want to think the police are good people, but they're just like anybody else.
[00:35:33.868 --> 00:35:34.689]  They can be corrupted.
[00:35:35.449 --> 00:35:36.350]  They can be purged.
[00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:40.652]  They can be organized into evil and then set upon the public.
[00:35:41.153 --> 00:35:50.879]  And that's what Klaus Schwab talks about, how they create a condition where the public has to rise up, and then they march a bunch of police in against them, and then the trigger takes place.
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:59.384]  But I saw footage out of Ukraine from where they were ordering people not to be allowed to protest or be in the streets for COVID.
[00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:03.272]  And the police there just dropped their shields and walked off.
[00:36:04.253 --> 00:36:05.133]  And that's really the answer.
[00:36:05.153 --> 00:36:10.697]  That's why the globalists want robots in control and technocracy in control.
[00:36:12.018 --> 00:36:18.643]  Because then humans can be cut out of the loop and there's not that human free will.
[00:36:21.165 --> 00:36:24.367]  Of whether the police are told, attack folks that are out here peacefully demonstrating.
[00:36:24.727 --> 00:36:26.128]  No, we'll just drop our shields and leave.
[00:36:27.089 --> 00:36:28.010]  That's the real courage.
[00:36:28.973 --> 00:36:30.654]  You know, they'd all been talking about it before they did it.
[00:36:32.574 --> 00:36:34.155]  And then the one guy decides to do it.
[00:36:34.175 --> 00:36:39.177]  And they orderly just go drop their shields in a pile for the city to come pick up.
[00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:40.057]  And they say, you know what?
[00:36:40.677 --> 00:36:43.278]  No, we're not going to beat people over the head for being out here peacefully.
[00:36:43.878 --> 00:36:44.979]  We're not going to destroy our own futures.
[00:36:44.999 --> 00:36:45.539]  We're not idiots.
[00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:48.731]  And that's what we should see.
[00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:50.892]  That really happened in Romania.
[00:36:50.932 --> 00:36:53.094]  That really happened in many other parts of the world throughout history.
[00:36:53.374 --> 00:37:06.485]  And it's the remake of that by the Wachowski brothers in V for Vendetta, where the military is about to shoot this crowd of people all wearing Guy Fawkes masks.
[00:37:08.006 --> 00:37:09.907]  And then finally, the colonel says, stand down.
[00:37:11.268 --> 00:37:14.311]  And then the tyranny falls.
[00:37:16.371 --> 00:37:30.281]  Instead, you have the left and Black Lives Matter, George Soros, in blackface, not black people, organizing criminals to burn down cities and intimidate and put their DAs in to control who can be prosecuted, trying to hold everybody hostage.
[00:37:33.143 --> 00:37:34.104]  And people see through that.
[00:37:34.745 --> 00:37:42.370]  Americans don't support shooting up police stations, burning down homeless shelters, running around, burning down car dealerships.
[00:37:43.691 --> 00:37:44.692]  No, we don't support that.
[00:37:46.559 --> 00:37:53.582]  But humans all over the world, as well as Americans, do support truckers peacefully going and saying, you want to put something in my body?
[00:37:54.002 --> 00:37:55.062]  You want to control my life?
[00:37:55.142 --> 00:37:58.964]  You want to tell me I got to have a digital pass to travel within a nation?
[00:38:00.464 --> 00:38:02.385]  I'm going to peacefully sit here for three weeks losing money.
[00:38:02.965 --> 00:38:08.267]  First, they cut their money off, take their bank accounts, and then with pickaxes, they smash their windows.
[00:38:08.607 --> 00:38:14.141]   But even when they agree to come out now, as an example to everybody, And there's up-close footage.
[00:38:14.161 --> 00:38:15.663]  Some of these guys were live-streaming when it happened.
[00:38:15.683 --> 00:38:16.443]  The cops don't care.
[00:38:17.264 --> 00:38:22.670]  They literally break their ribs, beat their faces in with the butts of rifles and billy clubs.
[00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:23.891]  Knocked their teeth out.
[00:38:23.911 --> 00:38:28.656]  I've got all the video and photos of people in the hospitals with their teeth knocked out, their ribs broken.
[00:38:30.017 --> 00:38:34.102]  And the left is all over Twitter celebrating, saying, good, follow police orders.
[00:38:36.089 --> 00:38:40.173]  You know, they're really lucky the 100,000 plus people that first showed up didn't bring cans of gasoline.
[00:38:40.493 --> 00:38:41.314]  And I'm not for that.
[00:38:41.775 --> 00:38:48.581]  But if they really wanted a war with you guys, you wouldn't see those cops out there if a hundred men fought back against them with weapons.
[00:38:49.222 --> 00:38:51.264]  But see, discretion is the greater part of valor.
[00:38:51.324 --> 00:38:51.664]  They didn't.
[00:38:52.505 --> 00:38:56.489]  They'll let you beat up the old ladies and run them over with horses and beat up the young men.
[00:38:57.552 --> 00:38:58.352]  Beat up the old men.
[00:38:58.773 --> 00:39:02.014]  They'll sit there and let you break their ribs, because they're like Gandhi.
[00:39:02.034 --> 00:39:03.134]  They're like Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:39:03.154 --> 00:39:04.195]  following Christ's example.
[00:39:04.875 --> 00:39:11.318]  They are simply putting their hands up and walking into the midst of the paramilitary troops, most of which we know were flown in.
[00:39:11.338 --> 00:39:12.198]  They're not even Canadians.
[00:39:12.498 --> 00:39:13.579]  We know dozens of U.N.
[00:39:13.619 --> 00:39:18.961]  aircraft are now confirmed landing around Ottawa the last week, disgorging these men covering their faces.
[00:39:20.922 --> 00:39:23.343]  So Trudeau's needles for black lives matter.
[00:39:24.163 --> 00:39:25.804]  And they loot shops and attack people.
[00:39:27.278 --> 00:39:33.979]  But then when you try to peacefully stand and say, I have human rights, I have dignity, well, they ride over you.
[00:39:34.339 --> 00:39:37.560]  By the way, the media tried to spin the old woman that got stepped on by the horse.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.120]  Said, oh, she's fine.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:39.640]  It's made up.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.460]  She jumped in front of the horse.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:41.600]  No, that's not true.
[00:39:43.401 --> 00:39:49.722]  All the different videos have been released now, and she's got broken ribs and bruised lung and heart and can't walk.
[00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:52.522]  You ever had a Clydesdale step on you?
[00:39:53.062 --> 00:39:53.423]  I haven't.
[00:39:55.723 --> 00:40:00.937]   But, uh, I've been in a car wreck not wearing a seatbelt when I was a teenager and had five ribs broken.
[00:40:00.977 --> 00:40:04.039]  Let me tell you, six weeks of excruciating pain every time you breathe.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:12.605]  And that's what that old lady got on her mobility scooter was a Clydesdale stepping on her chest.
[00:40:12.686 --> 00:40:14.187]  I wonder how that feels.
[00:40:14.387 --> 00:40:15.848]  Oh, those are the big tough cops.
[00:40:17.869 --> 00:40:18.410]  But you know what?
[00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:20.551]  They couldn't get the cops in Ottawa to do it.
[00:40:20.572 --> 00:40:26.096]  They had to ship in special people with double, triple pay from all over Canada and other areas who signed up to do this.
[00:40:27.301 --> 00:40:34.706]  So when you see those thousands of thug police and the horrible things they've done on video, remember that's not the majority of the police.
[00:40:34.726 --> 00:40:37.088]  The majority of the police were good men and women.
[00:40:37.848 --> 00:40:38.689]  Many have resigned.
[00:40:41.691 --> 00:40:45.613]  Including even the Davos Group graduate police chief they had before.
[00:40:45.913 --> 00:40:48.575]  He didn't want his hands dirty, his career messed up by this.
[00:40:49.456 --> 00:40:51.037]  He resigned when they brought in this new guy.
[00:40:52.307 --> 00:40:55.048]  And I'm not defending the institution of police just to defend it.
[00:40:55.388 --> 00:41:05.472]  What I'm explaining is, when you read the Davos Group and watch their clips, they're like, an angrier world, things are destabilizing, the governments cannot handle it, they are bad, we will save them.
[00:41:05.932 --> 00:41:12.554]  So they trigger the collapse, they run the policies to their operatives, and then they want us to think the revolution is attacking the police?
[00:41:12.974 --> 00:41:24.114]   All that will do is drive out the good officers so they can bring the scum in, and that's why you have the purge, of the military and the police all over the world under CRT and under the COVID shots and all of it.
[00:41:24.394 --> 00:41:27.474]  The left knows what it's doing.
[00:41:27.594 --> 00:41:29.835]  Getting rid of the smart people.
[00:41:32.675 --> 00:41:36.016]  Bringing in literal scum of the earth.
[00:41:36.936 --> 00:41:38.256]  By the way, I sent you guys a clip.
[00:41:39.236 --> 00:41:40.237]  Saturday, I didn't get to it.
[00:41:40.277 --> 00:41:48.178]  It's from a famous movie about the Nazis and stuff and it's where the Jewish man's not allowed to walk on the street, gets beat up by the officers.
[00:41:49.212 --> 00:41:49.872]  I meant to play that.
[00:41:49.932 --> 00:41:51.152]  Get that for me next hour.
[00:41:51.172 --> 00:42:01.354]  Because I want to play that with the real clips where they are treating women in the street just like Hollywood says Nazis treated Jews, which the Nazis did do that.
[00:42:02.334 --> 00:42:09.215]  And it's, oh my God, it's so horrible when it's happening 70 years ago, 75 years ago.
[00:42:09.516 --> 00:42:13.736]  But when it's happening in our countries, it's a good thing and the left celebrates it.
[00:42:15.116 --> 00:42:15.817]  I'm going to go to break.
[00:42:16.277 --> 00:42:17.857]  I'm going to just throw this out there for you.
[00:42:18.803 --> 00:42:21.805]  We need as much capital in here to take the global estimate of what we're doing.
[00:42:23.506 --> 00:42:25.947]  And we need you to get products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:42:27.048 --> 00:42:29.890]  And so we're going to end the sale on Wednesday.
[00:42:30.911 --> 00:42:35.252]  Of X3, the deep-earth crystal iodine, with two other types for your immune system, your body.

[00:42:36.972 --> 00:42:37.792]  It's a game-changer.
[00:42:37.832 --> 00:42:38.872]  It's what they don't want you to know about.
[00:42:39.132 --> 00:42:40.693]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen.
[00:42:40.973 --> 00:42:44.413]  The opposite of fluoride and bromide and chlorine and all the rest of it.
[00:42:44.954 --> 00:42:46.654]  It's been sold out for months and months and months.
[00:42:46.774 --> 00:42:48.554]  It's back in stock, 50% off.
[00:42:48.594 --> 00:42:50.394]  We've already sold out more than half of it.
[00:42:50.755 --> 00:42:53.695]  So it's going to go off sale on Thursday morning.
[00:42:54.655 --> 00:42:56.996]  So X3, 50% off.
[00:42:57.036 --> 00:42:57.816]  It's going to go to 25% off.
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:04.702]  Starting on Thursday, InfoWarsTore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[00:43:05.062 --> 00:43:09.283]  Then, BrainForce Ultra.
[00:43:10.643 --> 00:43:12.084]  It's a special nootropic.
[00:43:12.124 --> 00:43:18.386]  It gives you such clean, focused, fast-acting energy that I like because it goes away quickly.
[00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:20.150]  Two to three hours.
[00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:24.894]  I can take this when I'm exhausted at seven, got to do a big show, do, you know, big speech, whatever.
[00:43:25.334 --> 00:43:25.634]  Boom!
[00:43:25.935 --> 00:43:27.196]  Take a drop right under my tongue.
[00:43:27.516 --> 00:43:28.637]  Fifteen minutes it hits.
[00:43:29.478 --> 00:43:30.939]  And then three hours later I go to sleep.
[00:43:31.719 --> 00:43:34.422]  Now, turbo force, you're not going to be able to sleep for ten hours.
[00:43:35.062 --> 00:43:36.684]  It's the other end of this.
[00:43:36.764 --> 00:43:38.645]  It's like Godzilla attacking Tokyo.
[00:43:39.666 --> 00:43:42.128]  You've got brain force plus, it's just really natural, good nootropics.
[00:43:42.428 --> 00:43:45.711]  Five, six hours of good clean energy, but it's different.
[00:43:45.751 --> 00:43:48.858]   This is Really, for me, psychoactive what it does.
[00:43:48.898 --> 00:43:50.298]  This formula is really special.
[00:43:50.838 --> 00:43:58.981]  It's 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com or AAA253-3139 and you find the revolution against tyranny worldwide.
[00:43:59.501 --> 00:44:03.343]  And Wintersun, the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for immune system.
[00:44:03.383 --> 00:44:05.743]  It's 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:44:05.763 --> 00:44:06.344]  We'll be right back.
[00:44:07.624 --> 00:44:14.066]  Coming up next segment, the dictator of Canada has said martial law will continue, basically permanently, so has his minister.
[00:44:14.526 --> 00:44:16.227]  We already did a special report on that earlier.
[00:44:17.996 --> 00:44:22.461]  On Canadian tyranny, let's look at Australia right now, and the Great Reset Tyranny.
[00:44:26.165 --> 00:44:30.931]  Not far from here, such marches, even now, are being met with bullets.
[00:44:33.655 --> 00:44:43.483]  As Jamie White writes, Australian police have been deploying directed energy weapons against the peaceful Freedom Convoy protesters around the capital.
[00:44:43.684 --> 00:44:46.886]  Alright guys, Mrs. Cossack is feeling a bit under the weather, just like everyone here.
[00:44:47.507 --> 00:44:50.309]  People are feeling nauseous, people are feeling a bit of vertigo.
[00:44:50.609 --> 00:44:53.372]  That's the result of these police supersonic weapons.
[00:44:53.712 --> 00:45:00.196]  It's amazing that they've got nearly, what, three quarters of a million people out here and they cannot even send one person out to talk to us.
[00:45:00.296 --> 00:45:01.557]  Not even one person, you know?
[00:45:01.837 --> 00:45:03.699]  At least come out and hear what our views are.
[00:45:03.719 --> 00:45:06.100]  That's all we want to do is have our views expressed.
[00:45:06.481 --> 00:45:07.361]  What do you feel?
[00:45:07.381 --> 00:45:09.563]  Just a bit of a headache.
[00:45:09.623 --> 00:45:10.283]  A big headache.
[00:45:10.623 --> 00:45:11.244]  Yeah, for sure.
[00:45:12.248 --> 00:45:12.768]  What about you, sir?
[00:45:12.808 --> 00:45:13.288]  How do you feel?
[00:45:13.308 --> 00:45:13.849]  How do you feel?
[00:45:13.909 --> 00:45:14.369]  My ears.
[00:45:14.429 --> 00:45:15.629]  You can feel it in your ears?
[00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:16.430]  Yeah.
[00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:33.257]  Disturbing videos and photos circulating social media show Canberra protesters, including women and children, who appear to have been badly burned by directed microwave energy weapons with blisters on their faces, arms, and torsos.
[00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:44.422]  The use of directed energy weapons was thrown on the table as Australian Senators grilled the Australia Federal Police Commissioner, Rhys Kershaw.
[00:45:45.063 --> 00:45:53.847]  Pictures of the day appear to show some types of devices at the front of Parliament House, in between the entry to Parliament and Parliament lawns, where the protest was in fact occurring.
[00:45:55.108 --> 00:45:59.350]  Can you confirm whether the AFP had long-range acoustic devices at Parliament House on Saturday?
[00:46:00.114 --> 00:46:09.598]  That would be something that is our police methodology, which we would have to look at some sort of public interest immunity claim.
[00:46:10.418 --> 00:46:16.160]  I've been provided with this photograph, which I'm happy to table electronically, of course, from a distance.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:29.044]   It does appear to show the deployment of an LRAD machine, a long-range acoustic A device, I think it's called, which is a device designed to pitch sound at long range and can cause some pretty serious injuries.
[00:46:29.764 --> 00:46:34.205]  You can't confirm, even given that photo, that that device was deployed on the day?
[00:46:34.225 --> 00:46:39.026]  Senator Antic, I just want to interrupt you to make it clear that this question has already been taken on notice.
[00:46:39.846 --> 00:46:43.226]  I understand that, but... Do you have another question?
[00:46:43.586 --> 00:46:51.048]  With the benefit of having had that photograph, which tends to confirm it, we still can't confirm that that device was there on the day?
[00:46:52.391 --> 00:46:55.578]  Yeah, I think to be proper, I'd like to take that on notice.
[00:46:56.010 --> 00:47:00.954]  In relation to yesterday's protest, can I say how absolutely disgusted I was?
[00:47:01.375 --> 00:47:02.396]  It broke my heart.
[00:47:03.296 --> 00:47:11.603]  Millions and millions of people across our state are doing the right thing and it just broke my heart that people had such a disregard for their fellow citizens.
[00:47:12.164 --> 00:47:14.186]  I just ask everybody to think about that.
[00:47:14.866 --> 00:47:18.229]  Each of those people who protested illegally I'm sure have loved ones.
[00:47:18.249 --> 00:47:22.653]  They're going to go home and risk passing that virus on to their most closest people to them.
[00:47:22.893 --> 00:47:24.700]  That's what we saw in Sydney yesterday.
[00:47:25.443 --> 00:47:26.447]  Of course it was selfish.
[00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:28.575]  It was also self-defeating.
[00:47:29.557 --> 00:47:30.697]  It achieves no purpose.
[00:47:31.838 --> 00:47:33.478]  It will not end the lockdown sooner.
[00:47:34.038 --> 00:47:36.759]  It will only risk the lockdowns running further.
[00:47:37.039 --> 00:47:43.380]  People understand there are frustrations with lockdowns, but that type of behaviour doesn't help anybody.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.541]  Selfish behaviour doesn't help anybody.
[00:47:47.021 --> 00:47:53.623]  And so, in a city under lockdown, to engage in that was reckless and it was selfish.
[00:47:54.043 --> 00:47:58.964]  Even back in the United States, this weapon has caused chaos in the US capital.
[00:47:59.424 --> 00:47:59.684]  U.S.
[00:47:59.724 --> 00:48:05.230]  officials say there are now 130 suspected victims, mostly CIA operatives and U.S.
[00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:13.498]  diplomats being treated for brain injuries, debilitating headaches and vertigo, the targets they believe of a directed energy microwave weapon.
[00:48:13.738 --> 00:48:25.388]   There's a mysterious direct energy weapon that is being used and it is causing, in some cases, permanent Traumatic brain injury.
[00:48:25.468 --> 00:48:28.590]  New indications suggest the incidents go as far back as 1996.
[00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:36.974]  Two individuals working on the NSC believe they were targeted in 2019 and in 2020 just after the election.
[00:48:37.294 --> 00:48:49.781]  The Australian plandemic great reset tyranny is raising the bar on human rights abuses, adding fuel to the fire of the inevitability of the coming Nuremberg Code correction.
[00:48:49.861 --> 00:48:51.621]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:48:51.621 --> 00:48:54.200]  (upbeat music)
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.780]  (upbeat music)
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:59.361]  (upbeat music)
[00:48:59.361 --> 00:49:01.941]  (upbeat music)
[00:49:01.941 --> 00:49:04.521]  (upbeat music)
[00:49:04.521 --> 00:49:07.101]  (upbeat music)
[00:49:07.101 --> 00:49:09.681]  (upbeat music)
[00:49:09.681 --> 00:49:14.080]   D3 because it is essential and if you're not getting sunshine
[00:49:14.024 --> 00:49:18.464]   shine every single day, whether you're black or white or Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[00:49:18.464 --> 00:49:22.943]   Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that are out there.
[00:49:22.943 --> 00:49:26.224]   It's just like you need oxygen, you die in four minutes without oxygen.
[00:49:26.224 --> 00:49:28.703]  You die in five or six days without water.
[00:49:28.703 --> 00:49:30.264]  You die in a month without food.
[00:49:30.264 --> 00:49:35.304]   Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that
[00:49:35.304 --> 00:49:36.304]  you need.
[00:49:36.304 --> 00:49:39.944]   And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin

[00:49:59.253 --> 00:50:07.992]   History certainly repeats itself, especially when you're under Bilderberg, Demos Group, UN Corporate Larry Fink Black Rock Dictatorship.
[00:50:08.613 --> 00:50:09.594]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:50:09.614 --> 00:50:10.795]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:50:12.618 --> 00:50:18.665]  Ladies and gentlemen, Justin Trudeau, who says he wants to be a dictator, that says he wants to be able to silence people for their speech.
[00:50:20.396 --> 00:50:31.027]  He declared over a week ago a national emergency and suspended due process and said not just people that protest, but people that support peaceful protest will have their bank accounts frozen.
[00:50:31.928 --> 00:50:38.535]  His finance minister, who's the deputy leader of the country, is the co-chair of the Deimos Group.
[00:50:39.514 --> 00:50:43.557]  On the board of directors with Klaus Schwab, and she says it's permanent now.
[00:50:44.338 --> 00:50:51.083]  But Trudeau is the public spokesperson, so he's announcing it's 15 days to flatten the curve.
[00:50:52.346 --> 00:50:55.288]  And then it's two years, three years, four years, five years.
[00:50:56.008 --> 00:50:57.829]  They want a global digital ID.
[00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:03.372]  He's now saying it'll be on your vaccine passport, whether you're allowed to be places or not.
[00:51:03.753 --> 00:51:06.614]  That was always where they were going, always where they were taking us.
[00:51:07.215 --> 00:51:09.036]  And they're just normalizing all this.
[00:51:09.516 --> 00:51:12.258]  And then remember, Klaus Schwab says, we're going to have leaders do bad things.
[00:51:12.798 --> 00:51:13.999]  People will blame the governments.
[00:51:14.499 --> 00:51:16.220]  It will collapse confidence in the system.
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:17.181]  That will collapse.
[00:51:17.621 --> 00:51:19.202]  And we'll come in with a new global currency.
[00:51:20.307 --> 00:51:25.348]  And make them submit to us, then we can social engineer them because we control the universal basic income.
[00:51:25.528 --> 00:51:26.968]  This is very simple once you see it.
[00:51:28.909 --> 00:51:29.769]  I can give you the good news.
[00:51:29.809 --> 00:51:31.449]  They're in total panic mode right now.
[00:51:32.769 --> 00:51:33.950]  Total panic mode right now.
[00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:40.851]  And don't know what to do because they were supposed to just blame the governments and just have civil wars.
[00:51:42.131 --> 00:51:44.171]  And then on the ashes of that, build back better.
[00:51:45.892 --> 00:51:46.592]  That's the great reset.
[00:51:47.662 --> 00:51:48.223]  How do I know that?
[00:51:48.343 --> 00:51:51.605]  They write books like we're idiots talking about it, like we can't read that.
[00:51:52.566 --> 00:51:57.651]  But now they're figuring out, whoa, the proletariat is what Schwab calls the general public.
[00:51:58.111 --> 00:51:59.612]  They figured out what we're doing.
[00:52:00.053 --> 00:52:01.113]  Let's back off a little.
[00:52:02.595 --> 00:52:05.457]  But their own minions don't want to stop.
[00:52:05.537 --> 00:52:07.319]  Now they've got the taste for that power.
[00:52:08.837 --> 00:52:10.499]  And so things are now getting out of control.
[00:52:10.539 --> 00:52:11.540]  Here's a few clips of Trudeau.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.581]  He just gave a press conference.
[00:52:13.021 --> 00:52:17.346]  And then the situation in Australia is so criminal, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:17.946 --> 00:52:18.887]  Here's the dictator.
[00:52:19.788 --> 00:52:22.151]  Hi, Prime Minister.
[00:52:23.612 --> 00:52:25.054]  Do we still need the Emergencies Act?
[00:52:25.654 --> 00:52:26.715]  The blockades have been cleared.
[00:52:27.156 --> 00:52:28.517]  Parliament Hill has been cleared.
[00:52:29.238 --> 00:52:29.798]  Do we still need it?
[00:52:31.485 --> 00:52:43.196]  As I said, the Emergencies Act is not something to undertake lightly and it's something that needs to be momentary, temporary and proportional.
[00:52:44.017 --> 00:52:51.784]  That's why every single day I'm receiving briefings and we are reflecting on how much longer the Emergencies Act needs to be in place.
[00:52:52.184 --> 00:52:55.908]  We don't want to keep it in place a single day longer than necessary.
[00:52:57.093 --> 00:53:11.302]  But even though the blockades are lifted across border openings right now, even though things seem to be resolving very well in Ottawa, this state of emergency is not over.
[00:53:12.303 --> 00:53:25.612]  There continues to be real concerns about the coming days, but we will continue to evaluate every single day whether or not it is time and we are able to lift this state of emergency.
[00:53:28.755 --> 00:53:48.696]  I can't imagine that anyone who votes no tonight is doing anything other than indicating that they don't trust the government to make incredibly momentous and important decisions at a very difficult time.
[00:53:50.538 --> 00:54:02.418]  But like I said, I am confident that the majority of parliamentarians will stand up to support our values, to stand up to support our democracy, and to stand up to support their fellow Canadians.
[00:54:05.069 --> 00:54:08.373]  People talk about NLP and how they train these politicians how to talk.
[00:54:08.533 --> 00:54:10.596]  And if you are in an unconscious state, it works on you.
[00:54:10.936 --> 00:54:16.403]  That's NPR talk, that cadence and how he talks and how it's going to be this way.
[00:54:16.503 --> 00:54:17.865]  And oh, my goodness.
[00:54:17.925 --> 00:54:22.911]  And they all go to school for this at the Dabos Group and other groups on how to lie to you.
[00:54:25.447 --> 00:54:26.847]  They want to collapse society.
[00:54:26.948 --> 00:54:28.148]  They want to steal your property.
[00:54:28.448 --> 00:54:29.608]  They want to run your children.
[00:54:29.688 --> 00:54:30.849]  They want to depopulate you.
[00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:32.769]  They want you to own nothing and have nothing.
[00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:34.110]  They are the globalists.
[00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:35.530]  They are the enemy.
[00:54:35.831 --> 00:54:37.271]  They fall or we fall.
[00:54:40.852 --> 00:54:53.937]  Here is Freeland, the Bilderberg Group chairman, Davos Group co-chair, who's their finance minister, telling you when they'll let your bank accounts reopen.
[00:54:54.317 --> 00:54:54.657]  Here it is.
[00:54:56.202 --> 00:55:21.560]   And then finally, let me say, for anyone who is concerned that their accounts may have been frozen because of their participation in these illegal blockades and occupation, The way to get your account unfrozen is to stop being part of the blockade and occupation.
[00:55:23.642 --> 00:55:30.528]  These measures were put in place to disrupt illegal activity in Canada.
[00:55:31.128 --> 00:55:32.289]  Haha, illegal activity.
[00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:33.650]  You are the illegal activity.
[00:55:34.031 --> 00:55:38.675]  So there's no number you call, like a no-fly list that Nick Foyntes, eight months later, is still on.
[00:55:39.614 --> 00:55:40.974]  No criminal record, did nothing wrong.
[00:55:41.534 --> 00:55:54.497]  There's no, you just, oh, you just stop, we're watching you, and then magically this new power up there that's the big AI, Larry Fink, Klaus Schwab system of BlackRock, then it will let you go about your business.
[00:55:54.517 --> 00:55:59.077]  But next it won't just be peaceful protests, it'll be take your children for re-education.
[00:56:00.178 --> 00:56:02.958]  Next it'll be house a homeless person in your house.
[00:56:03.418 --> 00:56:11.404]   San Francisco's talking about a social credit score where you must house people or Well, they put a big fine on you of $100,000 a year.
[00:56:14.945 --> 00:56:22.549]  Now, John Bowne is always doing a great job, but he has really been on fire this weekend.
[00:56:22.569 --> 00:56:28.752]  He put out three reports yesterday, on Sunday, that are at Bandot Video.
[00:56:28.772 --> 00:56:31.253]  You click on the left-hand corner there and find the John Bowne section.
[00:56:33.494 --> 00:56:35.235]  The Bowne Report, B-O-W-N-E.
[00:56:36.232 --> 00:56:37.573]  And it's all right there.
[00:56:38.313 --> 00:56:39.914]  We already played the Canadian Great Reset.
[00:56:39.934 --> 00:56:41.535]  Then we played the Australian Great Reset earlier.
[00:56:41.575 --> 00:56:43.536]  We have the New Zealand Great Reset.
[00:56:43.556 --> 00:56:46.458]  You'll notice it's the same people, the same actors, the same globalists.
[00:56:47.019 --> 00:56:58.666]  But in this one, you've got to watch the Australian Great Reset because they've got not just sound cannons, they've got microwave guns on record shooting women and children.
[00:56:58.746 --> 00:57:00.767]  It can cause major brain damage.
[00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:05.423]  And then the same thing is said in Canada, the same thing is said in Australia, New Zealand.
[00:57:05.463 --> 00:57:09.346]  They go, oh, here in the government, we can't ask questions of the police.
[00:57:09.806 --> 00:57:13.349]  We can't question police tactics.
[00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:16.011]  So it's secret, you see.
[00:57:16.912 --> 00:57:21.822]   We're going to shoot something at you that It's been ruled internationally illegal to use.
[00:57:21.842 --> 00:57:32.186]  We're going to use it on our own people and put blisters and brain-damaged little children because there's three-quarters of a million people in Canberra, the capital, protesting, saying, stop it!
[00:57:34.347 --> 00:57:34.767]  Stop it!
[00:57:34.787 --> 00:57:35.767]  It's not about a virus.
[00:57:36.068 --> 00:57:37.508]  It's about locking us up and training us.
[00:57:37.528 --> 00:57:45.531]  We're prisoners until we take digital IDs that you can then tax and track and control what crimes you have committed.
[00:57:45.871 --> 00:57:47.032]  I'm going to say something again about Trudeau.
[00:57:50.405 --> 00:57:56.729]  Hitler was elected as a parliamentarian, as the President of Germany, with less than 30% of the vote.
[00:57:58.871 --> 00:58:09.518]  Then he became Chancellor, after the firebombing of their own Capitol building, and von Hindenburg stepped down and he then basically dissolved the office of President-Chancellor and made himself the Fuhrer.
[00:58:10.802 --> 00:58:12.243]  The same thing's been done by Trudeau.
[00:58:12.543 --> 00:58:15.844]  He called a snap election because he was so far behind in all the polls.
[00:58:16.184 --> 00:58:16.724]  He won by 30%.
[00:58:16.824 --> 00:58:18.725]  How did he win by 30%?
[00:58:18.865 --> 00:58:20.666]  Because there were so many candidates.
[00:58:21.046 --> 00:58:22.647]  He was the majority of those.
[00:58:23.587 --> 00:58:25.588]  And that's how they use parliaments to control people.
[00:58:26.128 --> 00:58:26.888]  Our system's better.
[00:58:26.928 --> 00:58:27.649]  It's got problems.
[00:58:28.169 --> 00:58:31.530]  But two parties is better than... All these leftist groups want dozens of parties.
[00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:33.631]  No, you have to have a party go away and have a new one.
[00:58:33.951 --> 00:58:38.153]  Or have one go away and then, say, the Republican Party splits into two different groups.
[00:58:40.876 --> 00:58:42.477]  But he is a dictator.
[00:58:43.698 --> 00:58:51.025]  Because you can be elected like Hitler, you can be elected like Trudeau, but you become a dictator.
[00:58:51.585 --> 00:58:59.031]  Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany on January 30th, 1933.
[00:59:01.473 --> 00:59:09.040]  But it all started in motion on February 27th, 1933, when they firebombed their own capital and blamed it on their political enemies.
[00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:11.770]  So that's where we are.
[00:59:11.790 --> 00:59:13.371]  All right, I want to give the number out.
[00:59:13.391 --> 00:59:14.411]  I want to take your calls.
[00:59:14.431 --> 00:59:15.672]  I want to get all the big COVID news.
[00:59:15.692 --> 00:59:17.153]  I haven't got into the pedo news yet.
[00:59:18.313 --> 00:59:20.274]  And people are really freaking out about this.
[00:59:21.434 --> 00:59:27.657]  Oh, they're not just going to have biological males take showers with your elementary school daughters.
[00:59:28.317 --> 00:59:29.298]  They're going to sleep with them.
[00:59:30.658 --> 00:59:32.199]  And they're going to get women pregnant in prison.
[00:59:33.019 --> 00:59:34.840]  But it's OK, because it's liberal.
[00:59:36.018 --> 00:59:38.620]  The total takeover of society by this cult.
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:39.521]  Stay with us.
[00:59:40.301 --> 00:59:42.242]  Well, this is breaking as we speak.
[00:59:42.823 --> 00:59:47.086]  Vladimir Putin is set to address the world sometime in the next hour.
[00:59:49.227 --> 00:59:50.669]  We'll see what he's going to announce.
[00:59:52.290 --> 00:59:59.415]  Probably that there have been Western attacks on Russian-held areas in eastern Ukraine that he is going to take those sectors.
[01:00:01.371 --> 01:00:15.080]  Or perhaps it's that he's going to give them an ultimatum for NATO to say that they're not going to take Ukraine and they will stop shipping heavy weapons into their border sectors or that he's going to invade.
[01:00:16.562 --> 01:00:27.129]  Clearly, this has all been done to put pressure on expansionist NATO to get them to back down and recognize Russia's legitimate security concerns.
[01:00:28.968 --> 01:00:31.170]  But the globalists hate God, so they love war.
[01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:33.532]  They hate God, so they hate families.
[01:00:34.853 --> 01:00:40.037]  And they hate Russia because Russia is now having a multi-child policy, just like China.
[01:00:41.618 --> 01:00:54.609]  Putin said to address nation on television, coming up, and that again is in the next hour or so.
[01:00:55.950 --> 01:01:00.411]  We will be watching all of that as that unfolds and have that punched up on our screens.
[01:01:02.231 --> 01:01:04.252]  The best place to go, I guess, will be RT America.
[01:01:04.272 --> 01:01:06.212]  You can even still get that in the U.S.
[01:01:06.972 --> 01:01:11.773]  and have that feed up so we'll have a translation of what's being said.
[01:01:11.833 --> 01:01:12.733]  That's a big deal.
[01:01:12.753 --> 01:01:15.614]  We're going to be watching all of that very, very closely.
[01:01:15.634 --> 01:01:19.215]  Here's some of the headlines.
[01:01:20.775 --> 01:01:25.696]  Putin embarrasses Biden after White House summit announcement said he's not meeting with Biden.
[01:01:27.324 --> 01:01:31.547]  Blitzkrieg or minor incursion, Putin's choice to determine world reaction.
[01:01:35.149 --> 01:01:38.411]  Ukraine crisis, Vladimir Putin's plan for invasion was already begun.
[01:01:38.431 --> 01:01:40.453]  In effect, warrants downing 10.
[01:01:42.354 --> 01:01:46.677]  Criminal denies concrete plans for Putin-Biden summit, as I mentioned.
[01:01:48.678 --> 01:01:52.320]  You had Boris Johnson over the weekend saying Russia plans biggest war in Europe since 1945.
[01:01:55.074 --> 01:01:58.818]  We got this video that I'll actually air next segment.
[01:02:00.219 --> 01:02:05.225]  Shocking live TV brawl as pro-Russian politician punched and put in a headlock.
[01:02:09.489 --> 01:02:15.556]  Russian intel chief claims capture of Ukrainian POWs as Putin considers independence of Donbass.
[01:02:17.127 --> 01:02:25.127]   And you've got all of the Western unconfirmed reports that the LGBT are going to be put in camps.
[01:02:25.127 --> 01:02:33.787]   When it's the left building, they're quarantine camps around the world.
[01:02:34.095 --> 01:02:36.776]  When it's the left that have already put our children in their pedophile camps.
[01:02:37.316 --> 01:02:38.176]  No evidence of this.
[01:02:38.657 --> 01:02:39.397]  Absolute crap.
[01:02:39.657 --> 01:02:42.778]  They're not arresting homosexuals in Russia.
[01:02:43.919 --> 01:02:49.817]   But anytime a CIA operative gets arrested, Then we hear, oh, they're gay!
[01:02:49.837 --> 01:02:52.078]  Again, Tim Cook can run death camps, why?
[01:02:52.518 --> 01:02:52.958]  He's gay.
[01:02:56.919 --> 01:03:01.520]  Russian terminator tanks move within two miles of Ukrainian border as war fears grow.
[01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:05.061]  U.S.
[01:03:05.101 --> 01:03:10.862]  warns, this is NBC, Moscow has compiled a list of Ukrainians to target after invasion.
[01:03:11.562 --> 01:03:12.422]  Oh, what, like U.S.
[01:03:12.462 --> 01:03:13.082]  military does?
[01:03:13.102 --> 01:03:15.223]  And then hangs people up by their feet?
[01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:22.834]  Russia planning extremely violent operation to crush Ukraine, says the CIA spokesperson.
[01:03:23.875 --> 01:03:32.540]  Ukraine crisis, version of Iraq, WMDs, Putin to send LGBTQ whatever persons to camps.
[01:03:33.461 --> 01:03:35.461]  There you go, folks.
[01:03:35.461 --> 01:03:41.461]  You know who's actually been sent to the camps?
[01:03:42.387 --> 01:03:44.328]  Let me show you who's actually been sent.
[01:03:46.921 --> 01:03:47.682]  To rape camps.
[01:03:49.524 --> 01:03:54.348]  The United States has rape camps of women and little boys and little girls.
[01:03:54.908 --> 01:03:56.409]  I got a whole stack of the U.S.
[01:03:56.449 --> 01:04:01.353]  government run by Democrats at the state and federal level sending children and women to rape camps.
[01:04:01.774 --> 01:04:03.215]  I actually have real rape camps right here.
[01:04:06.057 --> 01:04:07.057]  See this?
[01:04:07.057 --> 01:04:14.378]   I'm going to hit this war next segment and then go to your calls, but let me just go
[01:04:14.378 --> 01:04:15.657]  ahead and give me some of the headlines.
[01:04:16.187 --> 01:04:17.308]  Transgender prisons.
[01:04:17.768 --> 01:04:22.692]  Inmates reportedly getting women pregnant after California law allows men to house with women.
[01:04:23.473 --> 01:04:27.937]  And then the headlines in the LA Times say, how wonderful, two women had a baby.
[01:04:30.459 --> 01:04:34.262]  Many of the women reported are being raped, but that's okay because they're transgender.
[01:04:35.672 --> 01:04:37.393]  And then now you got this, speaking of camps.
[01:04:37.853 --> 01:04:49.099]  Outraged parents demand answers after non-binary male counselors, adults, were allowed to sleep with fifth grade girls in the same room.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:59.559]   So adult men with penises are sleeping in the dorm, in the little cabins with your daughters
[01:04:59.559 --> 01:05:08.239]  because they say, "Oh, we're just non-binary."
[01:05:08.239 --> 01:05:09.840]  And that's what the state law says.
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:19.840]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:05:11.524 --> 01:05:13.785]  So there's your sex camps right there.
[01:05:14.125 --> 01:05:15.585]  And it gets a lot worse here in Austin.
[01:05:16.105 --> 01:05:18.746]  This is Austin Public Library calling all high school students.
[01:05:19.106 --> 01:05:21.407]  Get paid to learn about sex education over spring break.
[01:05:21.747 --> 01:05:27.329]  Free classes on the evidence-based LGBTQ1A friendly courses.
[01:05:27.709 --> 01:05:30.970]  Oh, it's evidence-based that a man can have a baby and a woman can be a man.
[01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:32.270]  And that's what you learn.
[01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:34.651]  At least they're just targeting high schoolers here, but still.
[01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:36.291]  All sexualization.
[01:05:36.872 --> 01:05:37.852]  All sexual.
[01:05:38.272 --> 01:05:44.674]  Just like you see with the number four guy at Facebook resigning when he flew to Indianapolis to reportedly have sex with a 13-year-old.
[01:05:47.674 --> 01:05:49.115]  And that's why literacy's plunging.
[01:05:49.515 --> 01:05:50.795]  That's why everything's falling apart.
[01:05:50.815 --> 01:05:56.517]  Because you don't learn about reading, writing, arithmetic, or street smarts, or how to plant a garden, or how to balance a checkbook.
[01:05:57.441 --> 01:06:01.162]  You learn about things that I didn't know about until I was 20, 30 years old.
[01:06:01.843 --> 01:06:06.705]  In fact, I read the curriculum they teach like 10-year-olds now, and I learn horrid stuff I never knew about.
[01:06:08.225 --> 01:06:13.407]  Literacy, advocacy, highlights, CDC's fishy changes to early childhood development section.
[01:06:14.568 --> 01:06:19.149]  All behavioral psychologists, perverts, want to screw your kids up.
[01:06:19.169 --> 01:06:25.452]  Remember 10 years ago when they started, or this is like 14 years ago now, 2008, started giving out condoms to children as young as 10?
[01:06:27.768 --> 01:06:30.450]  And of course they got gang raped and now the Boy Scouts collapsed.
[01:06:30.811 --> 01:06:31.872]  This is how they take over.
[01:06:31.912 --> 01:06:34.013]  They intend for there to be girls raped at these things.
[01:06:34.414 --> 01:06:37.797]  And then the schools just go under and the very lawyers that run the whole thing make money.
[01:06:37.817 --> 01:06:39.498]  That's how they took the Vatican over.
[01:06:39.538 --> 01:06:40.859]  That's how they took the Catholic Church over.
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.242]  Chicago schools offer condoms to fifth graders.
[01:06:45.243 --> 01:06:46.344]  Society's changed.
[01:06:47.455 --> 01:06:48.056]  Fifth graders.
[01:06:48.676 --> 01:06:53.260]  Police in Germany investigate 30,000 potential suspects in pedophile probe run by the government.
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:55.361]  Yep, all the same people.
[01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:57.463]  And then trans swimmers face off.
[01:06:57.663 --> 01:06:59.525]  It'll all be nothing but men now in women's sports.
[01:06:59.585 --> 01:06:59.985]  Beautiful.
[01:07:01.166 --> 01:07:03.488]  Trans swimmers face off in Ivy League meet.
[01:07:03.868 --> 01:07:06.951]  And the results up in transphobic arguments against their participation.
[01:07:06.971 --> 01:07:08.752]  Oh, because they both were against each other.
[01:07:09.052 --> 01:07:11.234]  Yes, it ends it, says Yahoo News.
[01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:13.636]  Transgender Ivy League swimmers face off.
[01:07:14.817 --> 01:07:15.718]  Here's the two dudes.
[01:07:16.701 --> 01:07:19.743]  They're Clark Kent Jaws, but they're ladies now!
[01:07:19.783 --> 01:07:21.124]  They're champions now!
[01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:22.826]  And they're breaking world records!
[01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:30.806]  It's off to the Olympics.
[01:07:30.806 --> 01:07:31.806]  And it gets a lot worse.
[01:07:32.332 --> 01:07:36.796]  University backtracks after encouraging staff to use neo-pronouns.
[01:07:37.336 --> 01:07:38.297]  That you're cats.
[01:07:38.637 --> 01:07:42.400]  And in elementary schools, they're now putting cat boxes for children to defecate in.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:43.661]  Total mental illness.
[01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:49.440]   Total takeover and now they're announcing under head start to teach four-year-old boys
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:54.721]   They are girls and if they think they're a girl their parental rights are taken the state takes control prepares
[01:07:54.721 --> 01:07:59.500]   the child for mutilation And their testicles being removed total psychotic nightmare
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:03.440]   hellhole We are now here the collapse of the West under satanic
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:08.780]   control. We'll be right back Well as I said earlier in the hour before it was announced.
[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:16.020]   I said Putin will probably Declare areas of eastern Ukraine to be recognized as
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:22.685]   autonomous zones now of Russia And that is exactly what Russian state media is now saying.
[01:08:22.705 --> 01:08:24.346]  He's going to be speaking in the next 20-30 minutes.
[01:08:24.786 --> 01:08:25.946]  We'll be carrying that live.
[01:08:26.506 --> 01:08:28.887]  We found an English translation of it on Fox.
[01:08:29.507 --> 01:08:31.708]  Putin set to recognize Donbass.
[01:08:33.561 --> 01:08:45.748]  President Vladimir Putin has told foreign leaders that Moscow is likely to officially recognize the sovereignty of Donetsk and Lugansk, people's republics in Ukraine's war-torn east.
[01:08:46.308 --> 01:08:56.495]   The statement released on Monday, the Kremlin revealed that Putin has notified Prince President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz That is a very measured move by Russia.
[01:08:56.655 --> 01:08:59.257]  I don't again say that Putin's an angel or pervert or anything.
[01:08:59.077 --> 01:09:04.237]   in the near future, according to officials and two leaders expressing their disappointment.
[01:09:04.237 --> 01:09:07.516]   And what he's going to say is if they continue to get attacked, that will be an attack on
[01:09:07.516 --> 01:09:12.936]  Russia and he's got the weapons there to stop the attack.
[01:09:12.936 --> 01:09:16.356]  So that is a very measured move by Russia.
[01:09:16.356 --> 01:09:19.275]   I don't, again, say that Putin's an angel or perfect or anything.
[01:09:19.275 --> 01:09:23.956]   I just state the facts that the West overthrew that country with George Soros.
[01:09:24.245 --> 01:09:27.048]  The West's been attacking that almost 100% Russian area.
[01:09:27.828 --> 01:09:29.390]  And Russia was founded in Ukraine.
[01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:32.072]  And the globalists want to take over sovereign countries.
[01:09:32.593 --> 01:09:33.694]  I didn't support the Serbs.
[01:09:33.734 --> 01:09:34.595]  I'm not saying they're perfect.
[01:09:35.075 --> 01:09:38.058]  But they didn't start those wars and the Clintons bombing them.
[01:09:38.078 --> 01:09:40.740]  That doesn't mean that they didn't commit some atrocities.
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:44.824]  But even the UN admits twice as many Serbs died as Muslims and Croats.
[01:09:46.705 --> 01:09:47.446]  They're in Bosnia.
[01:09:47.846 --> 01:09:48.287]  Bosnians.
[01:09:49.557 --> 01:09:51.698]  I'm sure everybody's got stories on either side.
[01:09:53.039 --> 01:09:57.562]  You know, it's like if you're a black person that racist white people beat up, you can think that white people are bad.
[01:09:57.602 --> 01:10:04.006]  Or if you're a white person that got robbed or attacked by racist black people because you were white, you can hate all black people.
[01:10:04.046 --> 01:10:05.207]  That's not how I operate.
[01:10:06.628 --> 01:10:11.771]  But in these ethnic and cultural wars, I look for who starts it and who loses the most people.
[01:10:12.812 --> 01:10:14.433]  And the West is starting this.
[01:10:18.427 --> 01:10:19.708]  I want to get your take on this.
[01:10:19.728 --> 01:10:32.175]  I want to open the phones up on the obsession of the left to put biological men in the showers and in the bedrooms with little girls.
[01:10:32.315 --> 01:10:33.696]  It's a capturing.
[01:10:33.756 --> 01:10:34.617]  It's a revolution.
[01:10:35.257 --> 01:10:36.338]  It's taken over the schools.
[01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:37.739]  It's taken over the jails.
[01:10:38.139 --> 01:10:39.500]  It's taking over the sports.
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:41.381]  It's taking over the dormitories.
[01:10:41.461 --> 01:10:42.341]  It's taking over the life.
[01:10:42.582 --> 01:10:44.823]  And the same groups are saying, don't say mother or father.
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:47.620]  I want to talk about that.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.521]  I want to talk about the Russian situation with Ukraine.
[01:10:49.541 --> 01:10:50.701]  I want to talk about Canada.
[01:10:50.741 --> 01:10:57.504]  I want to talk about the LRADs and the radiation and the microwave guns being used on people in Australia.
[01:10:58.364 --> 01:11:01.685]  And the Prime Minister going, well, I don't get involved in what the police do.
[01:11:02.185 --> 01:11:04.326]  What weird advocation of authority is that?
[01:11:04.726 --> 01:11:05.286]  It's an excuse.
[01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:05.806]  It's criminal.
[01:11:05.826 --> 01:11:10.448]  I want to get your take on all of these issues here.
[01:11:11.681 --> 01:11:12.982]  I want to talk to first-time callers.
[01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:13.222]  877-789-2539.
[01:11:13.242 --> 01:11:16.444]  First-time callers, I want to hear from you, give you a chance to get on board.
[01:11:16.465 --> 01:11:16.505]  877-789-2539.
[01:11:16.525 --> 01:11:16.565]  877-789-2539.
[01:11:16.585 --> 01:11:16.605]  877-2539.
[01:11:16.685 --> 01:11:19.106]  Or, if your country code doesn't let you call a 1-800 number, 01512-646-1776.
[01:11:19.126 --> 01:11:19.287]  01512-646-1776.
[01:11:19.106 --> 01:11:28.226]   7-8-9-2-5-3-9-8-7-7-7-8-9-2-5-3-9-8-7-7-2-5-3-9 or if your country code doesn't let you call
[01:11:28.226 --> 01:11:36.707]  a 1-800 number, 0-1-5-1-2-6-4-6-17-76, 0-1-5-1-2-6-4-6-17-76.
[01:11:36.707 --> 01:11:41.985]   And I do intend to do some shows in the next few days where we just take calls from folks
[01:11:42.924 --> 01:11:52.153]  Or we just take calls from people in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand under the worst Great Reset operations.
[01:11:52.754 --> 01:11:57.058]  But today, it's wide open for first-time callers on all of those issues.
[01:11:57.078 --> 01:11:57.118]  877-789-2539.
[01:11:56.938 --> 01:12:06.578]   Let's go to the KTLA piece that I mentioned that's also in the Marjorie Taylor Greene
[01:12:06.578 --> 01:12:11.738]   interview I did yesterday that's also very powerful on the subject of what this means.
[01:12:11.798 --> 01:12:24.491]  This is, if you'll accept a man can have a baby, and if you'll accept full grown men with your elementary school daughters in the fifth grade, sleeping in the bunks with them, you'll accept anything.
[01:12:24.511 --> 01:12:27.334]  That's why they're handing out condoms to five year olds in public schools everywhere.
[01:12:28.257 --> 01:12:29.418]  Or to 5th graders, excuse me.
[01:12:29.838 --> 01:12:30.398]  To 10-year-olds.
[01:12:30.899 --> 01:12:40.184]  Because they want the state involved in the sexual activity of your children, because they know if they can get you promiscuous at a young age, on average you don't form lasting relationships.
[01:12:41.345 --> 01:12:42.186]  And it depopulates.
[01:12:42.886 --> 01:12:46.508]  And see, it's all in the documents why they do it, and it's so evil.
[01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:57.015]  It's so sick, the videos on Banned.Video, breaking MTG response to biological men sleeping with elementary school girls at state-sponsored camp.
[01:12:58.217 --> 01:13:00.059]  Well, let's go to the KTLA piece.
[01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:02.722]  And listen to this mind control.
[01:13:03.683 --> 01:13:11.511]  Parents mad people that identify as they them could sleep in girls cabins with young girls at science camp.
[01:13:12.993 --> 01:13:19.300]  No, it's men taking over women's spaces, taking over their sports, taking over everything, raping them in prison.
[01:13:20.453 --> 01:13:25.274]  And it's all done to train you that they have access to groom your children.
[01:13:25.774 --> 01:13:26.854]  The whole thing's pedophilic.
[01:13:27.354 --> 01:13:28.595]  The whole thing is transhuman.
[01:13:28.955 --> 01:13:30.235]  The whole thing is evil.
[01:13:31.315 --> 01:13:35.776]  And all the major public schools, and the Boy Scouts, and all of it, it's taken over, folks!
[01:13:36.216 --> 01:13:41.397]  That's why they, again, 12 years ago, 14 years ago, handed out condoms to 10-year-olds again.
[01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:46.804]   And they had giant, pedophilic, Events, orgies, raping your children.
[01:13:47.264 --> 01:13:51.688]  And I said it's going to bring down the Boy Scouts, destroy a good Christian organization, and it did!
[01:13:52.028 --> 01:13:54.410]  Done by the left, on purpose, they know what they're doing.
[01:13:54.710 --> 01:13:55.991]  It's indoctrination centers.
[01:13:56.011 --> 01:14:03.538]  So your children can't learn to go camp and build a fire, or tie a knot, or go fishing, or how to shoot a bow and arrow, how to shoot a rifle.
[01:14:03.558 --> 01:14:09.863]  No, you go and pedophiles, just like the ones that took over the Catholic Church, screw your children over, literally and figuratively.
[01:14:11.883 --> 01:14:16.367]  And it's all their plan to destroy the family and have the final revolution take over.
[01:14:16.567 --> 01:14:23.272]  The CIA ran giant child kidnapping rings in Germany with the CPS, with the family courts to create the new family.
[01:14:23.773 --> 01:14:26.475]  Which is men with boys, women with women.
[01:14:27.276 --> 01:14:31.019]  Totally screwed up, totally sick, totally segregated, satanic.
[01:14:31.659 --> 01:14:32.220]  Here's the report.
[01:14:33.359 --> 01:14:36.161]  Micah, the parents tell us that their children came home from camp.
[01:14:36.181 --> 01:14:39.344]  They were asking a lot of questions about gender and pronouns.
[01:14:39.664 --> 01:14:50.994]  The parents then reached out to the camp director who told them that counselors, biological males who identify as they-them, are permitted to spend the night in cabins with the young girls.
[01:14:53.416 --> 01:15:02.586]  In the parking lot of Weaver Elementary School in Los Alamitos, a group of parents... You know, parents should feel the way I feel after knowing what could have happened to my daughter.
[01:15:02.946 --> 01:15:07.010]  ...upset by the sleeping arrangements at a school organized science camp.
[01:15:07.190 --> 01:15:15.077]   I contacted the school and I asked them if they were able to confirm that there was not a man Actually sleeping in the same cabin as the girls.
[01:15:15.917 --> 01:15:17.558]  They were not able to confirm that.
[01:15:17.818 --> 01:15:30.963]  The parents say their fifth grade girls told them some of the biologically male counselors at Camp Pally in San Bernardino identified as they them and spent three nights sleeping in cabins with the young girls.
[01:15:31.323 --> 01:15:34.905]  They go to sleep, they use the shower, they go to the restroom.
[01:15:35.065 --> 01:15:41.009]  Camp Pelly confirms, per California state law, we place staff in cabins they identify with.
[01:15:41.469 --> 01:15:49.154]  Parents say they're not accusing anyone of a crime, but they are angry the school district did not let parents know about the policy.
[01:15:49.575 --> 01:15:57.661]   A spokesperson told us the district takes all complaints and concerns seriously and It's awful that children had to even experience this in 5th grade camp.
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:02.399]   say they just want others to be informed of the policy so they can make decisions
[01:16:02.399 --> 01:16:07.520]   for their own families. It's awful that children had to even experience this in
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:11.300]   fifth grade camp. If I was aware of it and I had initialed something saying
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:17.039]   that this was going to be done at this outdoor science camp, I would have kept
[01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:23.800]   my child home. So those parents insist that they should have been informed
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:27.679]   about this policy before they sent their kids off to camp and now they want the
[01:16:27.679 --> 01:16:30.960]  school district to step up.
[01:16:29.024 --> 01:16:33.769]  They want them to inform the parents of the hundreds of other kids who were also on that trip.
[01:16:34.209 --> 01:16:35.650]  We're live tonight in Los Alamitos.
[01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:37.572]  I'm Sandra Mitchell, KTLA 5 News.
[01:16:37.973 --> 01:16:39.154]  Sharon Micah, back to you.
[01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:44.717]  It's being done all over the world with the express system of getting past your boundaries.
[01:16:45.078 --> 01:16:46.238]  You don't have private property.
[01:16:46.559 --> 01:16:47.839]  Your children don't have their own bodies.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:51.922]  Remember what Andrew Cuomo said on CNN like five years ago?
[01:16:52.662 --> 01:16:57.906]  People complained about 10 year old girls with a biological man that was their new volleyball coach.
[01:16:58.975 --> 01:17:04.144]   In the shower, I mean, I'm sorry, I played football and stuff, I still had to get over being in showers with a
[01:17:04.144 --> 01:17:04.814]  bunch of dudes.
[01:17:04.814 --> 01:17:07.314]  It's weird. I'm into privacy, you know?
[01:17:07.314 --> 01:17:09.814]   Like the military, sitting there crapping on a toilet in front of somebody.
[01:17:09.814 --> 01:17:11.814]  Take something for a man to get over that.
[01:17:11.814 --> 01:17:18.814]   Imagine you're a little girl and there's a dude with his dong hanging out and...
[01:17:18.912 --> 01:17:30.081]  Vladimir Putin has just taken the podium and here on the Alex Jones Show we're going to go to this announcement by the Russian leader about the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe in the proxy war that is Ukraine.
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:35.399]   Perfect timing as we speak Vladimir Putin has just taken the podium and here on the Alex Jones show
[01:17:35.399 --> 01:17:39.161]   We're gonna go to this announcement by the Russian leader about the ongoing
[01:17:39.161 --> 01:17:44.300]   Conflict in Eastern Europe in the proxy war that is Ukraine here it is
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:51.560]   Of course my address is also aimed at our fellow
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:18:00.287]   citizens in Ukraine We'll have to have a substantive and detailed conversation because the matter is very serious.
[01:18:02.648 --> 01:18:05.529]  Situation in Donbass is becoming critical.
[01:18:07.290 --> 01:18:10.692]  And today I'm addressing you directly.
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:19.645]  Not only to talk about what's happening, but also to inform you about the decisions we're making, about possible steps in this regard.
[01:18:20.165 --> 01:18:25.488]  Once again, I would like to underscore that Ukraine is not just a neighbor, neighboring country to us.
[01:18:26.109 --> 01:18:30.491]  It is an inherent part of our own history, culture, spiritual space.
[01:18:31.932 --> 01:18:44.774]   They are our comrades, relatives, not only colleagues, friends, but also Our family, people we have blood and family ties with.
[01:18:47.195 --> 01:18:55.598]  Since ancient times, people from ancient southwestern Russian lands were calling themselves Russians and Orthodox.
[01:18:56.679 --> 01:19:05.242]  That was happening until 17th century when part of these territories rejoined the Russian Empire, the Russian state, and after that.
[01:19:05.582 --> 01:19:14.574]   It seems that we know all about this, that we are talking about facts that everyone knows, but at the same time we need to
[01:19:14.574 --> 01:19:19.153]   have understanding what is happening today to explain motives and aims
[01:19:19.153 --> 01:19:26.154]   that Russia has. We need to say a couple of words about the history of this matter.
[01:19:26.154 --> 01:19:34.914]   I would like to start by saying that the modern Ukraine was completely created by Russia. To be more
[01:19:34.914 --> 01:19:38.474]  exact by Bolshevist, Bolshevik communist Russia.
[01:19:38.581 --> 01:19:43.344]  This process has started almost immediately after the 1917 revolution.
[01:19:44.745 --> 01:19:53.350]  And Lenin and his supporters did it in a rough way, if we talk about Russia.
[01:19:53.410 --> 01:19:59.174]  They were alienating parts of historical territories of Russia.
[01:20:01.161 --> 01:20:02.762]  And millions of people who lived there.
[01:20:03.162 --> 01:20:05.244]  Obviously, no one asked anything.
[01:20:08.986 --> 01:20:21.094]  Then, before the Great Patriotic War in April, Stalin added to the USSR and handed over to Ukraine some lands that belonged to Poland and Hungary.
[01:20:21.534 --> 01:20:28.819]  And as a compensation, Stalin gave some ancient German lands to Poland.
[01:20:29.895 --> 01:20:35.738]  And in the 1960s Khrushchev decided to take Crimea away from Russia and also gave it to Ukraine.
[01:20:36.199 --> 01:20:39.801]  That's how the territory of the Soviet Ukraine was formed.
[01:20:40.721 --> 01:20:48.886]  But now I would like to draw your attention to the initial stages of the establishment of the USSR.
[01:20:48.966 --> 01:20:53.288]  I think it's of utmost importance for us because we have to start from afar.
[01:20:53.968 --> 01:21:04.188]   I would like to remind you that after the October Revolution of 1917 And the civil war that followed Bolsheviks started building a new state.
[01:21:07.089 --> 01:21:09.089]  And they had some differences among them.
[01:21:09.269 --> 01:21:16.269]   Stalin, who in 1922 was at the same time Secretary General of the Soviet Communist Party and
[01:21:16.269 --> 01:21:23.429]   People's Commissar on the Marriage of Ethnicities, decided to build the country on the principles
[01:21:23.429 --> 01:21:30.429]   of autonomy, thus giving to the republics, to the future administrative units, wide authority
[01:21:30.429 --> 01:21:37.588]   when they were supposed to join the state. Lenin criticized this plan and he suggested
[01:21:37.588 --> 01:21:44.588]   to make concessions to the nationalists, the way he called them back then, advocates of
[01:21:44.588 --> 01:21:52.069]   independence. Basically that was the idea about creating a confederation and give the
[01:21:52.069 --> 01:21:54.909]  right to every nation for self-determination.
[01:21:55.237 --> 01:21:57.058]  That was the basis of the Soviet state.
[01:21:57.458 --> 01:22:03.182]  First, in 1922, it was enshrined in the Declaration on the Establishment of the Soviet Union.
[01:22:03.222 --> 01:22:09.545]  And then, after the death of Lenin, it was also enshrined in the Constitution of the USSR of 1924.
[01:22:10.846 --> 01:22:13.068]  And right away, here we have a lot of questions.
[01:22:13.188 --> 01:22:14.989]  It raises a lot of questions.
[01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:28.689]   And first of them, and the main question, Why were they making all kinds of concessions to the Nationalists at the outskirts of the former Empire?
[01:22:31.570 --> 01:22:53.326]   To give to the administrative units that were haphazardly formed huge territories, oftentimes that had nothing to do with them, and they were giving these territories with the population of Historic Russia and these administrative units were given status and shape of the state entities.
[01:22:54.586 --> 01:22:56.847]  And once again, this begs a question.
[01:22:57.348 --> 01:23:12.575]  Why did they have to do such generous gifts, even the most blatant nationalists couldn't dream of, and at the same time give the Republic a right to withdraw from the new state without any preconditions?
[01:23:13.891 --> 01:23:15.893]  At first glance, it doesn't seem clear.
[01:23:16.093 --> 01:23:21.298]  It seems like madness, but only at first glance, because there is an explanation.
[01:23:21.458 --> 01:23:28.044]  After the revolution, the main goal Bolsheviks had was to keep power, to stay at power at any cost.
[01:23:29.065 --> 01:23:40.197]   And for this, they went to any length to sign humiliating conditions of the breast. Truth, when the Kaiser's Germany
[01:23:40.197 --> 01:23:44.677]   were in the dire economic situation and the outcome of the World War
[01:23:44.677 --> 01:23:51.597]   One was already almost decided and by giving any concessions to the nationalists inside the
[01:23:51.597 --> 01:23:52.117]  country.
[01:23:52.117 --> 01:23:56.717]   From the point of view of the historic destiny of Russia and its people,
[01:23:56.717 --> 01:24:03.277]   Lenin's principles of building the state weren't a mere mistake. That was much worse
[01:24:03.277 --> 01:24:06.197]  than a mere mistake.
[01:24:06.197 --> 01:24:11.597]   After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 this has become absolutely obvious.
[01:24:11.597 --> 01:24:14.597]  and...
[01:24:12.710 --> 01:24:19.029]   Of course, what happened in the past cannot be changed, but at least we have to talk about
[01:24:19.029 --> 01:24:25.949]   it in an honest and direct way, without any political agenda, without giving any political
[01:24:25.949 --> 01:24:27.309]  color to it.
[01:24:27.309 --> 01:24:35.229]   I can only add that the ideas of the current political realities, no matter how beneficial
[01:24:35.229 --> 01:24:45.630]   they might seem currently, under no circumstances should not be a basis of the building a state.
[01:24:45.630 --> 01:24:50.429]  I'm not blaming anyone, accusing anyone of anything.
[01:24:50.423 --> 01:24:51.944]  When we come back, we're going to get through all this.
[01:24:51.984 --> 01:24:52.984]  I know I already gave the number out.
[01:24:53.004 --> 01:24:54.465]  We're going to get to all your calls too.
[01:24:54.565 --> 01:24:57.605]  Who knows how long Putin's going to go, but we're going to come back and get to it.
[01:24:57.645 --> 01:25:01.126]  But again, I've studied history.
[01:25:01.666 --> 01:25:03.767]  I've never heard a modern world leader be this honest.
[01:25:04.878 --> 01:25:08.999]  I mean, he's like, yeah, we came in and hurt the Ukrainians, but it was ours to begin with.
[01:25:09.459 --> 01:25:10.980]  And Lenin gave it all away to begin with.
[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:11.940]  It's always been part of us.
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.081]  And yeah, then we came in and did mean things to him.
[01:25:14.541 --> 01:25:15.881]  And yeah, I mean, what do you want it to do?
[01:25:16.261 --> 01:25:17.982]  And he's going to probably go on and say, you want to be part of Europe?
[01:25:18.002 --> 01:25:19.222]  You want to be part of the New World Order?
[01:25:19.242 --> 01:25:21.362]  You want your sons taught to have their balls cut off?
[01:25:21.382 --> 01:25:23.863]  Because that's really what this comes down to.
[01:25:24.183 --> 01:25:27.964]  Because the West is going to put your kids with adults and pedophiles.
[01:25:28.144 --> 01:25:29.945]  I mean, the West is run by pedophiles now.
[01:25:30.805 --> 01:25:39.219]   And I guarantee you, he'll probably bring up something like that, because He wants to go back to Russia being Russia and things that were part of Russia being part of Russia.
[01:25:39.239 --> 01:25:41.000]  He doesn't want the other parts that weren't part of Russia.
[01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:44.362]  And my issue is, render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.
[01:25:46.243 --> 01:25:47.624]  We are not over there in Russia.
[01:25:47.744 --> 01:25:49.105]  They are not attacking us.
[01:25:49.645 --> 01:25:52.947]  The same globalists that cut off our pipelines have cut off their pipelines.
[01:25:53.748 --> 01:25:54.448]  And it needs to stop.
[01:25:54.508 --> 01:25:55.629]  Our enemy is in Hollywood.
[01:25:56.049 --> 01:25:57.630]  Our enemy runs Washington, D.C.
[01:25:58.851 --> 01:26:00.392]  Our enemy is not Russia.
[01:26:02.176 --> 01:26:05.558]  And it's because of that, the globalists say they're the main enemy.
[01:26:06.378 --> 01:26:08.979]  Because Russia has gotten out from the New World Order grasp.
[01:26:09.379 --> 01:26:10.340]  It has its own problems.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.581]  Leave Russia to the Russians.
[01:26:13.921 --> 01:26:21.825]  The issue is the Great Reset and Klaus Schwab, and the worldwide lockdown, and global depression, and 40 plus million people, they starved to death during that lockdown.
[01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:26.679]  We're going to see where he goes, because this was live, now it's going to be, you know, now it's in tape.
[01:26:26.699 --> 01:26:27.299]  We're going to come back.
[01:26:27.339 --> 01:26:28.439]  I don't know what Putin's going to say.
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:35.021]  I predicted before this even happened, he would say they're going to annex, you know, eastern Ukraine fully.
[01:26:35.041 --> 01:26:37.582]  And then if there's any attacks on it, they'll then attack Ukraine.
[01:26:38.442 --> 01:26:41.083]  So it's just the beginning of a larger war, in my view.
[01:26:41.543 --> 01:26:42.744]  That's a serious situation.
[01:26:43.144 --> 01:26:51.035]   And it's the Consequences of Soros and the New World Order wanting to start a war with Russia.
[01:26:51.115 --> 01:26:51.836]  It's very, very simple.
[01:26:52.456 --> 01:26:53.837]  While they sell us out to China and others.
[01:26:54.477 --> 01:27:01.180]  Separately, ladies and gentlemen, we'll open the phones up after Putin's done and take your calls or if he runs on forever about history, we'll have to just dissect a transcript.
[01:27:02.521 --> 01:27:03.522]  Still fascinating stuff.
[01:27:03.682 --> 01:27:12.699]   Please remember, I can't finance this operation without you and I appreciate you keeping us on air under all these attacks as we are loyal Americans promoting Basic American values.
[01:27:12.699 --> 01:27:16.899]   We have a lot of great products that are back in stock, like Winter Sun, amazing vitamin D3
[01:27:16.899 --> 01:27:19.378]   for your immune system and vitamin K, taken under the tongue.
[01:27:19.378 --> 01:27:22.199]   Such a smart thing for everybody to do to protect themselves.
[01:27:22.199 --> 01:27:27.539]   We also have Brain Force Ultra, which is a fast acting, but wears off quick too.
[01:27:27.705 --> 01:27:28.705]  Very special nootropic.
[01:27:28.725 --> 01:27:34.907]  It's not like 10-hour clean energy we have with TurboForce or 5-hour deep thinking with Brain Force Plus.
[01:27:34.947 --> 01:27:35.848]  It's a different formula.
[01:27:36.148 --> 01:27:37.528]  Hits really quick, wears off quick.
[01:27:37.568 --> 01:27:38.068]  It's amazing.
[01:27:38.428 --> 01:27:40.589]  I take it in the evenings when I need to be able to still go to sleep later.
[01:27:41.029 --> 01:27:44.350]  It's 40% off in winter sun, so you don't procrastinate.
[01:27:44.670 --> 01:27:49.112]  It's 50% off, and we're going to end the sale on X3 in three days.
[01:27:49.432 --> 01:27:50.552]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:27:50.572 --> 01:27:53.093]  All right, let's go back to Putin.
[01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:55.696]  It was live when we were watching it.
[01:27:55.716 --> 01:28:02.418]  We've now paused it so it's taped to air so we can hear what he's saying about what's about to happen in Eastern Europe, in Ukraine.
[01:28:02.438 --> 01:28:02.818]  Here it is.
[01:28:03.499 --> 01:28:06.020]  Say that that's how it happened.
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.280]  That's a fact.
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.581]  That's a historical fact.
[01:28:13.826 --> 01:28:17.711]  And as a result of Bolshevik's policy, the Soviet Ukraine was created.
[01:28:18.411 --> 01:28:25.780]  And we have every reason to say now that it's Ukraine created by Vladimir Lenin.
[01:28:26.541 --> 01:28:28.663]  He is its creator and architect.
[01:28:30.125 --> 01:28:34.290]  And it's fully confirmed by the documents from the archives.
[01:28:36.054 --> 01:28:42.721]  Also including the Lenin's decrees regarding Donbass that was added to Ukraine.
[01:28:42.861 --> 01:28:48.707]  And now grateful the sentence demolishing all the statues, all the monuments to Lenin.
[01:28:48.888 --> 01:28:50.529]  They call it decommunization.
[01:28:52.852 --> 01:28:54.294]  You want decommunization?
[01:28:54.694 --> 01:28:56.396]  Well, we are quite happy with that.
[01:28:58.075 --> 01:28:59.776]  But don't stop halfway.
[01:29:00.337 --> 01:29:05.520]  We are ready to show you what would mean actual decommunization for Ukraine.
[01:29:08.962 --> 01:29:34.110]   Coming back to the history of the matter, I would like to remind you that back in 1922, at the territory of the former Russian Empire, the Soviet Union was established, but the reality showed that Keeping this territory and ruling this territory using the principles of Confederation deems impossible because
[01:29:35.484 --> 01:29:40.128]  It had nothing to do, neither with the realities, nor with the historical tradition.
[01:29:40.848 --> 01:29:55.639]  And the Red Terror, and switch to the Stalin's purges, and the monopoly of the Communist Party, nationalization, planned economy, all that, in reality, was turned into a formality, nothing more.
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:59.242]  Principles that were declared, but didn't actually work.
[01:30:01.183 --> 01:30:04.366]  In reality, Soviet Republic had no sovereign rights.
[01:30:05.342 --> 01:30:05.562]  None.
[01:30:06.423 --> 01:30:12.491]  In practice, what was created, strictly centralized, Unitarian in its character.
[01:30:13.833 --> 01:30:15.655]  State that was centralized.
[01:30:15.895 --> 01:30:21.683]  Stalin implemented not Lenin's ideas, but his own ideas of how state should be built.
[01:30:24.068 --> 01:30:30.332]  But changes to the founding acts, to the Constitution, he didn't make any changes in this regard.
[01:30:31.433 --> 01:30:37.577]  Lenin's principles about building the Soviet Union were not reconsidered, technically.
[01:30:38.498 --> 01:30:40.279]  It seemed there was no need in this.
[01:30:40.959 --> 01:30:46.743]  Under totalitarian regime, authoritarian regime, everything worked well and it looked nice from the outside.
[01:30:47.223 --> 01:30:49.185]  It looked more than democratic, even.
[01:30:49.705 --> 01:30:50.906]  But still, it's a shame.
[01:30:53.089 --> 01:30:54.330]  It's a shame?
[01:30:55.891 --> 01:31:02.415]  Folks, I've been around 48 years, and I've been on air 28 years, and I've seen a lot of crazy stuff.
[01:31:03.076 --> 01:31:12.442]  And I knew that Putin started meeting with Shultz and Eaton in the last decade of his life, and I know people that reportedly know Putin and say, no, he's an anti-New World Order, InfoWars listener.
[01:31:12.742 --> 01:31:13.482]  And I'm not naive.
[01:31:13.502 --> 01:31:14.943]  I don't go, oh, Putin must be great.
[01:31:15.384 --> 01:31:17.345]  But now you see it more and more.
[01:31:17.845 --> 01:31:37.462]   Vladimir Putin repudiating communism, saying it's horrible, He may even come out and say Western powers put Lenin in, because I know Putin knows that now, and that Russia has gotten free from this to a certain extent, and that we need to get free of this globalism as well, these parasites, and then we can have real peace and an incredible future.
[01:31:37.502 --> 01:31:40.385]  I mean, folks, Russia's got three times the resources the U.S.
[01:31:40.405 --> 01:31:40.585]  does.
[01:31:40.605 --> 01:31:43.848]  I mean, it's the richest country in the world.
[01:31:44.208 --> 01:31:45.690]  We should have a huge deal with them.
[01:31:46.787 --> 01:31:48.449]  And be working with them.
[01:31:48.469 --> 01:31:50.152]  But again, the globalists don't like that.
[01:31:50.552 --> 01:31:52.875]  They want to use the Chinese slave colony to leverage everybody out.
[01:31:53.215 --> 01:31:57.721]  They want to implode the third world, starve them to death, to flood the West, so the West collapses.
[01:31:58.162 --> 01:32:00.204]  And then mayhem must have a war with the damn Russians.
[01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:07.074]  I mean, it's just the stupidest thing you would do for prosperity and peace and a future the world's ever seen.
[01:32:07.735 --> 01:32:11.417]  And, you know, I don't see how you see any fault in Putin, what he's saying.
[01:32:11.938 --> 01:32:13.259]  I mean, it's all historically true.
[01:32:13.719 --> 01:32:14.579]  Stalin's horrible.
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:15.340]  Lenin's horrible.
[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:16.521]  We're sorry what we did to you.
[01:32:16.541 --> 01:32:17.622]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:32:17.662 --> 01:32:18.182]  What do you want?
[01:32:18.222 --> 01:32:19.643]  I mean, you know it's coming.
[01:32:19.863 --> 01:32:22.525]  You want to be under George Soros or you want to be your own country?
[01:32:22.765 --> 01:32:23.546]  We don't want you.
[01:32:23.766 --> 01:32:24.827]  We want to do business with you.
[01:32:26.087 --> 01:32:28.229]  Just just please, please don't go to war with us.
[01:32:28.909 --> 01:32:34.100]   I mean, And to hear somebody actually tell the truth from that level is powerful!
[01:32:34.441 --> 01:32:36.402]  Because the truth is powerful!
[01:32:37.042 --> 01:32:39.044]  And the truth lives in Infowars.
[01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:44.307]  I mean, and look, I'm not somebody that gushes over leaders or people or any of this.
[01:32:44.567 --> 01:32:48.150]  And I know Russia's got serious corruption problems and everything else, believe me.
[01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:54.472]  But, I mean, everything Putin said so far is dead-on historically accurate.
[01:32:54.812 --> 01:32:59.354]  He just apologized for the Communists taking over Ukraine and killing people.
[01:32:59.694 --> 01:33:01.054]  He just said Lenin was horrible.
[01:33:01.355 --> 01:33:02.855]  He just said Stalin was horrible.
[01:33:03.455 --> 01:33:06.236]  He just said authoritarianism is terrible and he wants free market.
[01:33:07.177 --> 01:33:10.718]  And he wants to work with the world and he wants to see Ukraine be separate from Russia.
[01:33:11.038 --> 01:33:13.579]  He doesn't want to run Ukraine.
[01:33:13.819 --> 01:33:15.119]  He wants to do business with Ukraine.
[01:33:15.539 --> 01:33:16.160]  Yeah!
[01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:17.220]  Yeah!
[01:33:19.770 --> 01:33:20.030]  Absolutely.
[01:33:20.771 --> 01:33:22.031]  Absolutely.
[01:33:24.152 --> 01:33:24.412]  Absolutely.
[01:33:24.952 --> 01:33:25.213]  Absolutely.
[01:33:25.853 --> 01:33:26.173]  Absolutely.
[01:33:26.793 --> 01:33:27.113]  Absolutely.
[01:33:27.994 --> 01:33:28.254]  Absolutely.
[01:33:28.094 --> 01:33:33.213]   it was live. It's just incredible. So we'll see if he announces he's taking
[01:33:33.213 --> 01:33:37.453]   over the east of Ukraine and that if the West attacks those people he'll defend
[01:33:37.453 --> 01:33:40.654]   them, hopefully trying to end the war with the threat of military action by
[01:33:40.654 --> 01:33:45.413]   showing strength. But I mean I don't see any fault with this and compared to
[01:33:45.413 --> 01:33:50.493]   other world leaders I mean he just telling the truth. He talks about reality
[01:33:50.493 --> 01:33:54.654]  being real, being realistic.
[01:33:53.686 --> 01:33:54.606]  How truth matters.
[01:33:55.006 --> 01:33:56.387]  How truth is what's valuable.
[01:33:56.727 --> 01:33:58.407]  And yeah, that's the only damn thing that works.
[01:33:58.447 --> 01:33:59.847]  Like, mathematics is truth.
[01:34:00.067 --> 01:34:00.687]  It lines up.
[01:34:00.827 --> 01:34:04.768]  Or history, when you tell it accurately, is, I mean, you know.
[01:34:06.929 --> 01:34:11.530]  That's why when the system claims Alex Jones lies, or Alex Jones is a mastermind deceptive, no.
[01:34:12.270 --> 01:34:13.930]  The truth is, there's not masterminding anything.
[01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:17.071]  I just go with deep research, and then my spirit and what I think's right.
[01:34:18.157 --> 01:34:22.360]  I do a lot of research, and that's intellectual, but then my spirit looks at it and makes a decision.
[01:34:23.821 --> 01:34:24.982]  And this is a big deal, folks.
[01:34:25.282 --> 01:34:34.168]  This is Putin straight shooting the world, and of course they're not going to play it on most of the channels, they'll take it out of context, but this is really the truth about what happened in Ukraine, the history of it, and the rest of it.
[01:34:34.188 --> 01:34:34.689]  Let's hear the rest.
[01:34:36.477 --> 01:34:46.844]  Article 17 of the Constitution of Ukraine doesn't allow military bases of foreign states to be deployed in their territory, but it seems that it can be bypassed.
[01:34:47.405 --> 01:34:51.388]  They have deployed training missions of the NATO countries in Ukraine.
[01:34:51.668 --> 01:34:54.010]  Basically, that's a military base already.
[01:34:55.951 --> 01:34:58.052]  They just call it a mission, and it's done.
[01:34:58.793 --> 01:35:04.274]   In Kyiv, they have long declared strategic Aim at joining NATO.
[01:35:04.314 --> 01:35:11.281]  Yes, obviously every country have the right to choose their own alliances to sign military agreements.
[01:35:11.682 --> 01:35:13.163]  That's true, but there is one.
[01:35:13.884 --> 01:35:20.932]  But in international law it says the principle, there is a principle of indivisible security.
[01:35:22.802 --> 01:35:29.024]  Which states that one country cannot enhance its security at the expense of security of others.
[01:35:29.464 --> 01:35:39.667]  And I can refer here to the European Security OAC Charter that was adopted in Istanbul in 1999 and Astana OAC Declaration from 2010.
[01:35:40.307 --> 01:35:46.508]  In other words, choosing means to enhance one's security should not create any threats for other states.
[01:35:46.689 --> 01:35:51.850]  And if Ukraine was to join NATO, would serve as a direct threat to the security of Russia.
[01:35:52.250 --> 01:36:08.469]  And I would remind you back in April of 2018 at the Bucharest summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, USA forced these members to make a decision that certain states were to join NATO.
[01:36:08.488 --> 01:36:15.327]   A lot of European allies already back then understood all the risks of such a step, but
[01:36:15.327 --> 01:36:19.847]  they had to subdue to the will of their older partner.
[01:36:19.847 --> 01:36:24.648]  Americans used them to pursue anti-Russian policy.
[01:36:24.648 --> 01:36:29.448]   Some NATO members still are skeptical about Ukraine joining NATO.
[01:36:29.685 --> 01:36:33.469]  And from some European capitals, we get a signal.
[01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:36.492]  They are saying, so what are you worrying about?
[01:36:36.572 --> 01:36:38.054]  It's not going to happen tomorrow.
[01:36:38.394 --> 01:36:40.736]  And now our American counterparts are saying the same.
[01:36:41.057 --> 01:36:43.519]  We say, okay, it is not going to happen tomorrow.
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:47.003]  But the day after tomorrow then, what will it change?
[01:36:47.703 --> 01:36:50.605]  In historical context, nothing more than that.
[01:36:50.985 --> 01:37:09.896]  We know that the stance and the statements of the US leadership about the active confrontation military actions in the east of Ukraine would not stop Ukraine to join NATO if it will correspond to the criteria of the NATO Charter and if they can overcome corruption.
[01:37:10.497 --> 01:37:15.440]  And they try to convince us that NATO is a peaceful and defensive bloc.
[01:37:16.365 --> 01:37:17.885]  So, there is no threat for Russia.
[01:37:18.645 --> 01:37:21.886]  And they, again, suggest we believe their words.
[01:37:22.246 --> 01:37:25.147]  But we already know the value of such words.
[01:37:25.487 --> 01:37:38.287]   Back in 1990, when we talked about uniting Germany, the USA promised to the Soviet leadership that
[01:37:38.287 --> 01:37:45.006]   neither jurisdiction nor military presence would not move an inch to the east,
[01:37:45.006 --> 01:37:50.806]   and unification of Germany would not lead to the eastward expansion of NATO.
[01:37:50.806 --> 01:37:55.087]   And I'm quoting here, so they were saying all these things,
[01:37:55.087 --> 01:37:59.886]   they were giving us assurances, but these were just words later,
[01:37:59.886 --> 01:38:05.007]   they started saying that Central European and Eastern European countries joining NATO
[01:38:05.007 --> 01:38:09.806]   will improve their relations with Moscow, will rid these countries from the fears
[01:38:09.806 --> 01:38:15.327]   of their difficult historical legacy, and more than that, it will allow them
[01:38:15.327 --> 01:38:19.606]  to create this belt of the friendly nations.
[01:38:20.566 --> 01:38:22.067]  It was the other way around.
[01:38:22.848 --> 01:38:29.133]  These states are now bringing their stereotypes, their complexes of the Russian threat to NATO.
[01:38:29.413 --> 01:38:35.458]  They insisted on increasing potential of collective security that was supposed to be deployed against Russia, first of all.
[01:38:35.738 --> 01:38:48.608]  And it was happening back in the 1990s and early 2000s when, because of the openness and goodwill, our goodwill, relations between Russia and the West were at high level.
[01:38:51.058 --> 01:39:03.146]  Russia fulfilled all its obligations, withdrew troops from Germany, from the Central and Eastern European countries, and it made a huge contribution in overcoming the legacy of the Cold War.
[01:39:03.446 --> 01:39:10.991]  We consistently suggested all kinds of cooperation, including in the format of the Russian NATO Council and OSCE.
[01:39:11.691 --> 01:39:16.034]  More than that, I will say one thing that I have never said before in public.
[01:39:17.839 --> 01:39:19.200]  I will say it for the first time.
[01:39:20.322 --> 01:39:32.875]  Back in 2000, when President Bill Clinton was visiting Moscow at the end of his term, I asked him, how would America see Russia joining NATO?
[01:39:34.857 --> 01:39:48.222]   I would not give you all the details of that conversation, but the reaction to my conversation looked Well, the result, let me put it this way, and how did Americans really look at this possibility?
[01:39:48.522 --> 01:39:53.264]  You can see it in their practical steps in regard of our country.
[01:39:53.765 --> 01:40:07.911]  Open support of the terrorists in North Caucasus, ignoring our demands and our concerns in the security area, withdrawing from the treaties, arms treaties, and so on and so forth.
[01:40:08.993 --> 01:40:10.874]  It still begs the question, why?
[01:40:11.214 --> 01:40:12.235]  Why did they do that?
[01:40:12.695 --> 01:40:13.235]  What for?
[01:40:13.455 --> 01:40:20.920]  Okay, you don't want to see friend in us and ally in us, but why do you want to make an enemy out of us?
[01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:33.015]   The only answer that we got was, it's not about our political regime or anything else, it's just they don't need Such a big and independent country is Russia.
[01:40:33.316 --> 01:40:35.257]  So that's the answer to all the questions.
[01:40:35.637 --> 01:40:42.102]  That's the source of traditional American policy they pursue in the Russian track.
[01:40:42.542 --> 01:40:47.125]  That's why they react like this to all our proposals about security.
[01:40:47.465 --> 01:40:55.050]  You only need to look at the map to see how did the Western countries keep their word about non-expansion of NATO eastwards.
[01:40:55.371 --> 01:40:56.672]  They just lied to us.
[01:40:57.682 --> 01:41:01.404]  We had five waves of NATO expansion.
[01:41:01.584 --> 01:41:06.185]  In 1999, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary were joint NATO.
[01:41:06.225 --> 01:41:11.708]  In 2004, Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania and Slovenia.
[01:41:11.808 --> 01:41:13.128]  In 2009, Albania and Croatia.
[01:41:13.508 --> 01:41:18.110]  In 2017, Montenegro and 2020, North Macedonia.
[01:41:19.851 --> 01:41:27.479]   As a result, the Alliance, its military infrastructure, is drawn really close to the borders of Russia.
[01:41:27.799 --> 01:41:32.603]  That's one of the reasons, of the key reasons of the security crisis.
[01:41:33.284 --> 01:41:36.206]  It affected the entire system of international relations.
[01:41:36.586 --> 01:41:38.008]  The mutual trust was lost.
[01:41:38.348 --> 01:41:43.632]  The situation continues to get worse in strategic area as well.
[01:41:43.872 --> 01:41:52.580]  In Romania and in Poland as part of the US project, they deploy anti-missile defensive systems.
[01:41:53.823 --> 01:41:58.867]  We all know that the launchers deployed there can be used for cruise missiles Tomahawk.
[01:41:59.468 --> 01:42:02.390]  That is a strike weapon, strike system.
[01:42:03.271 --> 01:42:06.774]  And USA is also developing standard six missile.
[01:42:07.714 --> 01:42:16.822]  It can not only be used as an anti-missile defensive tool, it can strike at targets on land and on the sea.
[01:42:18.456 --> 01:42:23.280]  So, they are expanding their infrastructure and they get new offensive capabilities.
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:36.149]  From the information that we get, we have every reason to believe that further deploying the sites, the facilities of North Atlantic Treaty Organization, this decision has already been made.
[01:42:36.710 --> 01:42:38.351]  That's just a matter of time.
[01:42:38.471 --> 01:42:45.796]  We understand clearly that under this scenario, the level of military threat for Russia will be increased manifold.
[01:42:46.097 --> 01:42:53.901]   I would like to draw your attention Once again, that there will be a bigger threat of immediate attack against our country.
[01:42:55.161 --> 01:43:06.026]  In American strategic documents, in their doctrine, there is such a possibility of preventive work against the missile complexes of the adversary.
[01:43:06.366 --> 01:43:08.527]  And who is the main adversary of the United States?
[01:43:08.708 --> 01:43:09.448]  We all know that.
[01:43:09.708 --> 01:43:10.048]  Russia.
[01:43:12.369 --> 01:43:19.976]   In NATO documents, our country is officially directly called a main threat to the North Atlantic security.
[01:43:21.998 --> 01:43:26.583]  And Ukraine will serve as the platform for such an offense.
[01:43:26.743 --> 01:43:32.088]  If our ancestors heard about that, they would probably thought that it's impossible.
[01:43:32.208 --> 01:43:33.970]  We don't want to believe that either.
[01:43:34.230 --> 01:43:35.451]  But that's how it is now.
[01:43:37.653 --> 01:43:40.076]  I want people from Russia and Ukraine to understand that.
[01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:58.761]   Many Ukrainians airfield are positioned close to our borders and strategic NATO airplanes using high-precision weapons can strike targets in Lagegrad, Samara, Kazan and Astrahan.
[01:43:58.761 --> 01:44:04.240]   Using reconnaissance tool will allow NATO to control the airspace of Russia up until
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:05.561]  the Urals.
[01:44:05.561 --> 01:44:12.520]   And finally, after the US withdrew from the INF Treaty, the Pentagon has openly started
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:23.161]   developing a whole range of the land-based missiles with the range of 5500 kilometers.
[01:44:23.161 --> 01:44:28.240]   If such systems are deployed in Ukraine, they can hit the targets in the European Russia
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:31.641]  and also behind the Urals.
[01:44:31.641 --> 01:44:37.161]   And the travel time of the Tomahawk missiles to Moscow will be less than 35 minutes.
[01:44:37.161 --> 01:44:39.921]  Ballistic missiles - 7-8 minutes.
[01:44:39.921 --> 01:44:47.002]  And hypersonic offensive weapons - 4-5 minutes.
[01:44:47.002 --> 01:44:49.560]  That's like having a knife against our throat.
[01:44:49.805 --> 01:44:53.807]  And I have no doubt they plan to implement these ideas.
[01:44:55.848 --> 01:45:05.653]  And as it has been done previously when they expanded NATO to the east, moving infrastructure, military infrastructure closer to our borders.
[01:45:07.378 --> 01:45:09.542]  Ignoring our protests and our warnings.
[01:45:10.183 --> 01:45:12.086]  They just didn't care about that.
[01:45:12.146 --> 01:45:14.731]  They did whatever they deemed necessary and appropriate.
[01:45:15.272 --> 01:45:19.399]  And I believe they plan to continue doing like that.
[01:45:20.956 --> 01:45:25.420]  Because they see us as a dog barking at the caravan.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.603]  We have never agreed to that, and we never will.
[01:45:29.063 --> 01:45:35.509]  Russia was always standing for resolving the most difficult issues at the negotiating table.
[01:45:35.829 --> 01:45:41.774]  Diplomatically, we understand our responsibility for global stability.
[01:45:41.854 --> 01:45:49.374]   Back in 2008, Russia has come up with an initiative on signing an agreement about European security.
[01:45:49.374 --> 01:45:55.753]   And its idea was, its gist was, that no state, no international organization, European Atlantic
[01:45:55.753 --> 01:46:01.213]   could not enhance its security at the expense of security of others.
[01:46:01.213 --> 01:46:09.193]   But our suggestion was refuted from the get-go because we can't allow Russia to limit the
[01:46:09.193 --> 01:46:10.373]  activities of NATO.
[01:46:10.374 --> 01:46:19.124]  We were told that legally binding guarantees of security only NATO members can have such guarantees.
[01:46:19.444 --> 01:46:35.944]   And last December we have sent our partners the draft document about security guarantees and also the draft agreement on the measures of enhancing Russian security and NATO member security.
[01:46:36.405 --> 01:46:39.047]  In response, NATO members and the U.S.
[01:46:39.207 --> 01:46:40.388]  were saying a lot of words.
[01:46:40.749 --> 01:46:53.794]   There was some reasonable ideas but they were talking only about secondary things and it looked as an attempt to Bring this discussion away from the main point, and we react it in kind.
[01:46:53.815 --> 01:47:05.439]  I would like to emphasize that we are ready to negotiate, but only on the condition that all matters will be considered as a package, in complex, without going away from the main proposals made by Russia.
[01:47:06.279 --> 01:47:08.220]  And those have three main items.
[01:47:10.141 --> 01:47:13.562]  Firstly, non-expansion of NATO to the East.
[01:47:14.781 --> 01:47:30.288]  non-deployment of offensive weapons next to the Russian borders and finally bringing back the military infrastructure back to the configuration of 1997 when the founding act was signed between Russia and NATO.
[01:47:30.828 --> 01:47:33.849]  These principle proposals were ignored.
[01:47:36.130 --> 01:47:54.282]   Our Western partners once again They were saying same old words that every state has freedom to choose ways to enhance its security, to provide its security, to join any military alliances.
[01:47:54.843 --> 01:47:56.904]  So nothing changed in their position.
[01:47:57.624 --> 01:48:01.707]  They talk about the same open doors policy.
[01:48:02.127 --> 01:48:02.847]  More than that.
[01:48:03.227 --> 01:48:05.309]  Once again, they try to blackmail us.
[01:48:06.289 --> 01:48:08.750]  Once again, they threaten us with sanctions.
[01:48:09.570 --> 01:48:17.972]  And I think they will still impose those, introduce those, as strong and as more powerful our country becomes.
[01:48:20.052 --> 01:48:27.654]  They will always find an excuse to introduce more sanctions, regardless of the situation in Ukraine, that is.
[01:48:27.794 --> 01:48:31.134]  The only goal they have is to contain the development of Russia.
[01:48:31.434 --> 01:48:33.895]  And they will do that like they did it before.
[01:48:36.869 --> 01:48:39.417]  Without any formal excuse.
[01:48:39.618 --> 01:48:40.802]  Only because we exist.
[01:48:42.074 --> 01:48:48.236]  And we will never concede our sovereignty or national interests and our values.
[01:48:48.656 --> 01:48:50.357]  And I want to be frank.
[01:48:50.817 --> 01:48:58.460]  In the current situation, when our proposals about equitable dialogue, about principle matters, had no response from the U.S.
[01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:09.023]  and NATO, when the level of threat for our country is becoming greater and greater, Russia has every right to take countermeasures to enhance our own security.
[01:49:09.463 --> 01:49:11.424]  And that's how we plan to act.
[01:49:16.104 --> 01:49:27.469]  As for the situation in Donbass, we can see that the Kiev elite keeps stating publicly about lack of willingness to implement the Minsk agreements to settle the conflict.
[01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:30.110]  They are not interested in peaceful resolution.
[01:49:30.810 --> 01:49:36.032]  Vice versa, they want to start Blitzkrieg like it happened back in 2014 and 2015.
[01:49:35.952 --> 01:49:46.391]   2014 and 2015 and you remember what those how it ended now almost every day
[01:49:46.391 --> 01:49:50.978]   they are shelling settlements in Donbass They have amassed large troops.
[01:49:51.838 --> 01:50:06.163]  They're using offensive unmanned vehicles and other heavy machinery, torturing people, children, women, elderly people.
[01:50:06.503 --> 01:50:07.303]  It doesn't stop.
[01:50:07.363 --> 01:50:08.083]  It doesn't cease.
[01:50:08.624 --> 01:50:10.304]  We see no end to it.
[01:50:11.284 --> 01:50:18.284]  and the so-called civilized world.
[01:50:18.284 --> 01:50:23.604]   And our Western colleagues proclaim themselves as the only representatives
[01:50:23.604 --> 01:50:25.164]  of this free world.
[01:50:25.267 --> 01:50:29.330]  They prefer not to notice this, as if there is nothing like this happening.
[01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:33.774]  There is no genocide perpetuated against 14 million people.
[01:50:34.014 --> 01:50:41.019]  And the only reason is that these people didn't want to back the coup d'etat in 2014.
[01:50:41.419 --> 01:51:04.063]   They stood against the nationalist movement The movement towards nationalism, Stone Age nationalism and Nazism, and they want to defend their basic rights to live on their land, to speak their native language, to preserve their traditions and their culture.
[01:51:05.004 --> 01:51:07.105]  How much longer that could go on?
[01:51:07.746 --> 01:51:10.748]  How much longer can they bear it?
[01:51:11.368 --> 01:51:15.992]  Russia did everything it could to keep the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
[01:51:16.801 --> 01:51:31.504]  We tried hard to implement the resolution of the Security Council of UN 22-02 that endorsed the Minsk agreements on resolving the situation in Donbass, but everything was done in vain.
[01:51:31.984 --> 01:51:42.106]  The presidents are changing, the parliament members are changing, but the idea of the aggressive regime is still the same regime that seized the power in Kiev.
[01:51:44.019 --> 01:52:00.226]  It was created by the coup d'etat of 2014, and those who chose the way of violence, they admit they see no other way to resolve the Donbass crisis other than the military way.
[01:52:00.666 --> 01:52:13.691]  In this regard, I deem it necessary to make a decision that should have been made a long time ago, to immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of Donetsk People's Republic and Lugansk People's Republic.
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:27.431]  And I would like to request the Federal Assembly to support, to back this decision and ratify the agreement of friendship and mutual help with both republics.
[01:52:27.731 --> 01:52:31.515]  We will draft this document and sign these documents in the near future.
[01:52:34.765 --> 01:52:40.970]  And those who seize the power and keep the power in Kiev, we demand to stop hostilities immediately.
[01:52:41.431 --> 01:52:55.570]   Otherwise, all the responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodbath will be on the consciousness of the Regime that is ruling in Kiev by declaring these decisions
[01:52:55.570 --> 01:53:02.461]   I'm confident that I will have support of the people of Russia all the patriotic forces of Russia. Thank you for
[01:53:02.461 --> 01:53:05.530]   your attention I guess he's using this opportunity to go over some of the
[01:53:05.530 --> 01:53:08.792]   history of what's happened there and and obviously try to get
[01:53:08.792 --> 01:53:15.452]   Ukraine to be its own sovereign state and not a puppet of Europe and not a puppet of Russia, but an actual
[01:53:15.452 --> 01:53:21.761]   autonomous country That is its own and he's obviously sitting there explaining
[01:53:21.761 --> 01:53:26.371]   that those eastern areas were given by
[01:53:26.371 --> 01:53:31.020]   the Soviets to Ukraine and that's been part of Russia and so you're not
[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:34.091]   gonna attack it and you're not gonna take it and that's what he's doing
[01:53:34.091 --> 01:53:43.161]   And then I would imagine when we ever get there Just common sense will be do not attack it or we'll see it as an attack on Russia and so they're about to absorb that region in.
[01:53:43.181 --> 01:53:55.133]  It's the same way World War I started, same way World War II started, was different European countries battling over zones and arguable areas just like cities battle each other over, you know, annexing what zones.
[01:53:54.972 --> 01:54:11.972]  It's all very interesting.
[01:54:12.751 --> 01:54:16.714]  Winter Sun is the highest quality organic vitamin D3 taken out of the tongue.
[01:54:16.734 --> 01:54:19.997]  It also has vitamin K, critical for your immune system and so much more.
[01:54:20.583 --> 01:54:25.287]  It's 50% off despite the fact it's going to sell out very, very quickly because everybody needs this.
[01:54:25.968 --> 01:54:27.709]  Old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[01:54:27.809 --> 01:54:29.411]  You need what's in Winter Sun.
[01:54:29.451 --> 01:54:32.193]  And then we have BrainForce Ultra.
[01:54:32.654 --> 01:54:41.741]  Super fast acting, amazing clean, nootropic system that is a complement to BrainForce Plus and of course TurboForce.
[01:54:42.162 --> 01:54:43.503]  All three of these are different formulas.
[01:54:44.123 --> 01:54:44.783]  All right, folks.
[01:54:44.803 --> 01:54:51.925]  What we're going to do here as we battle the New World Order is Putin is actually continuing on.
[01:54:51.744 --> 01:54:54.465]  at infowarestore.com for a limited time.
[01:54:54.465 --> 01:54:56.024]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:54:56.024 --> 01:54:58.864]   If you haven't tried these products, you really need to because they are amazing.
[01:54:58.864 --> 01:55:00.284]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:55:00.284 --> 01:55:07.144]   All right, folks, what we're gonna do here as we battle the New World Order
[01:55:07.144 --> 01:55:09.505]  is Putin is actually continuing on.
[01:55:09.505 --> 01:55:11.545]  I was wrong when I said he stopped.
[01:55:11.545 --> 01:55:15.224]   And we're gonna follow that and have all the quotes and technicals about what's happening.
[01:55:14.934 --> 01:55:15.675]  Will there be war?
[01:55:15.715 --> 01:55:16.456]  Will it be expanded?
[01:55:16.496 --> 01:55:17.017]  What's happening?
[01:55:17.037 --> 01:55:19.420]  It looks like he's doing a long history lesson here.
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:21.142]  We're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[01:55:21.642 --> 01:55:29.272]  But as we speak, we'll have the Sputnik feed, I've noticed, has a good English translation of what he's saying in basically near live time.
[01:55:30.213 --> 01:55:33.463]   And we will be Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:55:33.483 --> 01:55:33.883]  Long time listener.
[01:55:33.703 --> 01:55:38.303]   Claire's formal recognition of Ukrainian separatist regions as sovereign states.
[01:55:38.303 --> 01:55:40.363]  That reportedly just happened.
[01:55:40.363 --> 01:55:44.703]  So right now, let's go back or go to your phone calls now.
[01:55:44.703 --> 01:55:50.703]   Let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Pennsylvania, then we'll go to Laura in Canada.
[01:55:50.703 --> 01:55:51.703]  Scott, welcome.
[01:55:51.703 --> 01:55:52.703]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:52.703 --> 01:55:53.703]  How are you?
[01:55:53.703 --> 01:55:54.703]  Long time listener.
[01:55:54.703 --> 01:55:55.703]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[01:55:55.703 --> 01:55:59.303]  Honor to talk to you, brother.
[01:56:00.182 --> 01:56:24.220]  I just wanted to dovetail off the fact that the dehumanization, I feel as if it's a double-edged sword simply because by putting all this demoralization out, I feel as if the people, it'll be more easy to see how evil our government has become.
[01:56:24.941 --> 01:56:34.304]  Unless we've gone too far and the chemical warfare has taken over so much of our minds that we literally cannot see what's being done.
[01:56:34.524 --> 01:56:46.629]  And just as, you know, it's been mentioned before, if all this evil, you know, is put forth in front of us and we choose to accept it, then, you know, we deserve it.
[01:56:46.649 --> 01:56:49.330]  Well, that's right.
[01:56:49.390 --> 01:56:51.731]  The geoengineering and the grooming of the children.
[01:56:51.771 --> 01:57:05.960]   I mean, look at how Whether it's the Boy Scouts or public schools have science camps for fifth grade elementary student girls and then they send in biological men to sleep with them and then they don't tell the parents.
[01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:07.161]  It's all pedophilic.
[01:57:07.221 --> 01:57:08.202]  It's all creepy.
[01:57:08.602 --> 01:57:11.304]  It's the state coming in and taking control of your children.
[01:57:12.405 --> 01:57:12.986]  It's a rape.
[01:57:14.191 --> 01:57:21.795]  This whole leftist movement is just raping our minds, raping our currency, raping our borders, raping our children, raping our freedom.
[01:57:22.095 --> 01:57:25.396]  And I've got the Washington Post article out today saying, freedom is bad.
[01:57:26.197 --> 01:57:27.817]  As he says, freedom is evil.
[01:57:29.038 --> 01:57:33.520]  I mean, you're like, that's cartoonish, but folks, they actually say that in headlines everywhere.
[01:57:35.401 --> 01:57:43.667]   It's ridiculous because it's so in our face, it's so blatant, so over the top that You would have to be a blind man not to see any of this.
[01:57:43.687 --> 01:57:44.728]  It's because they can't help it.
[01:57:44.868 --> 01:57:46.609]  People are like, this isn't a good move.
[01:57:47.170 --> 01:57:48.631]  Why do they say they want to have sex with our kids?
[01:57:48.671 --> 01:57:49.491]  Why do they love the devil?
[01:57:49.872 --> 01:57:51.293]  Why are they saying freedom's evil?
[01:57:51.533 --> 01:57:53.074]  Because they're evil folks!
[01:57:53.494 --> 01:57:54.175]  They're gone!
[01:57:54.195 --> 01:57:55.536]  They can't help it!
[01:57:57.597 --> 01:58:03.800]  God says that when you turn yourself over to evil long enough, he turns you over to a reprobate mind, and you lose your soul, basically.
[01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:05.701]  You become an avatar of a demon.
[01:58:06.081 --> 01:58:07.762]  You become a robot of Satan.
[01:58:08.102 --> 01:58:09.923]  And these people, they're gone, brother.
[01:58:10.283 --> 01:58:10.944]  They're gone.
[01:58:12.764 --> 01:58:19.608]  And I just, I pray every night, and I pray, I pray that God protect you, Alex, and the rest of the InfoWars crew, and every other- I know you're praying for me, and I need it, brother.
[01:58:19.628 --> 01:58:24.030]  Because our mission is important, and also be selfish and say, I don't want to get killed or put in prison, but yes.
[01:58:24.370 --> 01:58:26.231]  Will you promise to keep praying for InfoWars, brother?
[01:58:27.122 --> 01:58:27.562]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:27.902 --> 01:58:29.343]  I love you and I appreciate you, Scott.
[01:58:29.363 --> 01:58:30.044]  Thank you so much.
[01:58:30.064 --> 01:58:31.664]  I love all of you folks.
[01:58:31.744 --> 01:58:32.505]  I love you so much.
[01:58:34.566 --> 01:58:35.406]  Laura in Canada.
[01:58:35.426 --> 01:58:36.367]  Laura, thank you for calling.
[01:58:38.448 --> 01:58:39.008]  Hi, Alex.
[01:58:39.088 --> 01:58:41.430]  Thank you so much for taking my phone call.
[01:58:41.850 --> 01:58:42.670]  I'm calling actually.
[01:58:42.710 --> 01:58:49.814]  I live in Ontario and I broadcast with a larger network out of New Orleans, Louisiana with my own show, United Public Radio Network.
[01:58:50.589 --> 01:58:56.154]  I share that, because I get a lot of stuff sent to me, like we do when people follow our shows from all over the world.
[01:58:56.414 --> 01:58:57.395]  Yeah, you have a lot of contacts.
[01:58:58.355 --> 01:59:20.093]  Yeah, so I watch, I'm hearing from Australia, all over the world, thanks, they get right from the people, but what I'm going to say is, you know, I'm also a nurse with critical care experience, and I watched live when that grandmother, who is also a clan mother and First Nations person, like a head of First Nations, basically being a clan mother, what happened?
[01:59:20.737 --> 01:59:24.020]  And I can't even begin to describe the horror.
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:26.882]  And I've seen some awful stuff being a critical care nurse.
[01:59:27.423 --> 01:59:27.703]  Yep.
[01:59:27.763 --> 01:59:34.789]  In fact, guys, while she's talking, roll that footage of the woman on the walker, woman on the mobility scooter being trampled by the Clydesdale.
[01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:36.711]  Yeah, I saw more of the footage, too.
[01:59:36.731 --> 01:59:37.952]  She has a bunch of broken ribs.
[01:59:37.992 --> 01:59:38.713]  She could die.
[01:59:38.733 --> 01:59:41.015]  And the media is making jokes about her.
[01:59:41.775 --> 01:59:42.576]  What did you make of that?
[01:59:44.137 --> 01:59:45.938]  I, you know what, I don't cry easily.
[01:59:45.958 --> 01:59:47.678]  I was in tears.
[01:59:48.138 --> 01:59:51.699]  Like I said, I've seen horrible things and I was traumatized.
[01:59:52.299 --> 02:00:00.601]  I got sent a video this morning from a couple trying to go down to downtown Ottawa to get some breakfast and the police stopping them.
[02:00:00.982 --> 02:00:07.103]  She's got it on video saying to them, you people, you're doing all this illegal stuff.
[02:00:07.123 --> 02:00:08.283]  You're not coming down here.
[02:00:08.604 --> 02:00:10.144]  It's all blocked off the road.
[02:00:10.885 --> 02:00:12.305]  Oh, I love the comments on Twitter.
[02:00:12.345 --> 02:00:14.806]  Like, half of them are like, that old bitch deserves to die.
[02:00:15.086 --> 02:00:15.947]  Should have followed orders.
[02:00:16.247 --> 02:00:17.587]  What has happened to these people?
[02:00:17.607 --> 02:00:19.748]  Because there's one thing, the cops doing it, that's bad enough.
[02:00:19.768 --> 02:00:22.969]  But the left's celebrating trampling people with horses.
[02:00:24.049 --> 02:00:29.211]  Well, now Chrystia Freeland is calling for us to keep these war measures laws.
[02:00:29.311 --> 02:00:36.653]  And she actually said in a live broadcast that we should be now freezing the funds of those that support Trump.
[02:00:37.740 --> 02:00:38.300]  I saw that.
[02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:41.741]  They're going to take as much power as they can get.
[02:00:41.761 --> 02:00:43.322]  Can you believe how naked they are now?
[02:00:44.602 --> 02:00:52.264]  Well, they are, but what my concern is, and people may, you probably have seen this, but there has been sort of an anonymous video that was on TikTok.
[02:00:52.824 --> 02:01:01.146]  Gentleman that is a trucker, kind of hid his identity, calling for all truckers to drop their loads starting today and don't bring anything else.
[02:01:01.186 --> 02:01:03.927]  They've warned Canadians to go out and get their supplies.
[02:01:04.428 --> 02:01:07.610]  Because it won't take long for the shelves to empty.
[02:01:07.690 --> 02:01:08.911]  It's a holiday today.
[02:01:09.652 --> 02:01:10.753]  How crazy is this?
[02:01:10.773 --> 02:01:14.996]  It's supposed to be family day today, after everything that's been going on in our country.
[02:01:16.383 --> 02:01:39.820]   Well, Canada is hard-working people and nice people, like Midwesterners in America, or Southerners on average, whether they're black, white, Hispanic, they're just such nice people, and they thought you were wimps, so they chose you as the target because they thought you'd roll over, but you didn't roll over, and now they're so angry at you, and all they've done has awakened the sleeping giant.
[02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:43.260]   And I know that more truckers are coming, more people are coming,
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:48.020]   and I know there's huge marches of hundreds of thousands in other Canadian cities,
[02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:50.499]  and that's got to really scare the system.
[02:01:50.499 --> 02:01:52.180]  What are you seeing?
[02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:56.300]   Well, you know what, where I live, I'm right smack dab in the middle of Canada.
[02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:59.819]   So you have to come through my city to go from either side of Canada,
[02:01:59.819 --> 02:02:02.620]  if you're crossing, or down to Southern Ontario.
[02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:04.260]  So there are more truckers, we've heard them.
[02:02:04.260 --> 02:02:07.580]  We're very close to the intersecting highways in my city.
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:10.419]  So they're coming, but what's his next move?
[02:02:10.419 --> 02:02:20.248]   I mean, and you know, people that are- The other big story is there's truckers from all over Canada now, when they started seeing them beat people up three days ago, that triggered them to come.
[02:02:20.288 --> 02:02:27.536]  What's going to happen when a few thousand thug cops, because most cops wouldn't be part of it, they surveyed police nationwide, as you know, who would come and do evil.
[02:02:27.837 --> 02:02:32.943]  What are those few thousand thugs going to do when now another hundred thousand truckers show up to respond to their evil?
[02:02:34.048 --> 02:02:36.852]  And nobody wants to be violent, okay?
[02:02:36.872 --> 02:02:37.953]  This is, and you know what?
[02:02:37.993 --> 02:02:39.154]  We know why they did this.
[02:02:39.375 --> 02:02:42.278]  Because they were hoping people would retaliate.
[02:02:42.439 --> 02:02:43.360]  They're fighting back.
[02:02:43.420 --> 02:02:47.665]  I saw right away when I saw the green uniforms, I knew they weren't from Canada.
[02:02:47.865 --> 02:02:48.306]  Right away.
[02:02:48.386 --> 02:02:49.648]  I heard your report, by the way.
[02:02:49.708 --> 02:02:51.470]  Oh yeah, did you see all the UN aircraft landings?
[02:02:52.464 --> 02:02:53.424]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:02:53.464 --> 02:03:04.129]  Well, when you were broadcast, you were doing a newscast about Southern California, that the 4,000 plus police were set to lose their jobs unless they agreed to come up to Canada.
[02:03:04.189 --> 02:03:05.389]  Now, we love you guys.
[02:03:05.409 --> 02:03:06.810]  You are our brothers and sisters.
[02:03:07.410 --> 02:03:09.191]  We pray for you, just like we know.
[02:03:09.471 --> 02:03:16.574]  The one thing about this, Alex, that we have to say, like you said, it's awakened the sleeping lion, but it has united the world.
[02:03:16.634 --> 02:03:18.975]  It's made people realize we're not alone.
[02:03:19.591 --> 02:03:21.692]  We're united in humanity.
[02:03:21.732 --> 02:03:25.814]  Yeah, you're going to get people out there like the left and people that... Laura, that's awesome.
[02:03:25.834 --> 02:03:26.814]  How do people find your show?
[02:03:28.295 --> 02:03:31.616]  It is tonight, actually, on United Public Radio Network.
[02:03:31.656 --> 02:03:32.817]  It's called The Angel Rock.
[02:03:33.117 --> 02:03:35.358]  And I'm broadcasting from 10 p.m.
[02:03:35.458 --> 02:03:36.699]  to... Beautiful.
[02:03:36.739 --> 02:03:37.399]  Thank you so much.
[02:03:37.439 --> 02:03:38.379]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:03:38.740 --> 02:03:41.621]  I've always admired China's basic dictatorship.
[02:03:42.601 --> 02:03:45.963]  And now Trudeau and others are announcing a permanent civil emergency.
[02:03:49.801 --> 02:03:55.603]  Putin is going in hard on Ukraine with the rhetoric referring to Ukraine's process of decommunization.
[02:03:56.344 --> 02:03:57.524]  You want to decommunize?
[02:03:57.704 --> 02:04:00.905]  Well, we are fine with that, but let's not stop halfway.
[02:04:01.445 --> 02:04:05.147]  We're ready to show you what real decommunization is like for Ukraine.
[02:04:10.129 --> 02:04:12.810]  And then he goes on to say, I am decommunizing Russia.
[02:04:16.511 --> 02:04:22.470]   But the hardline right-wingers here So brainwashed that Russia was our enemy for their lifetimes.
[02:04:23.131 --> 02:04:24.551]  Say, oh, it's a secret plot.
[02:04:24.571 --> 02:04:25.532]  They're still in bed with them.
[02:04:25.572 --> 02:04:33.335]  No, the Larry Finks and Black Rocks and globalist organizations hate Russia's guts because Russia is not under their control.
[02:04:35.115 --> 02:04:39.677]  Doesn't mean Russia's perfect, but it means the globalists are not in control of it and they can't stand it.
[02:04:39.697 --> 02:04:42.458]  All right, let's move quickly through your amazing phone calls.
[02:04:42.478 --> 02:04:48.721]  We'll give each caller a minute or two so we get to everybody who's been holding the longest here.
[02:04:49.963 --> 02:04:50.944]  I really just don't have a view.
[02:04:50.765 --> 02:04:57.265]   would be Chris and then Rick. Chris in Michigan, right up there where all this is going on
[02:04:57.265 --> 02:05:00.164]  by Canada. Chris, what's your view on the situation?
[02:05:00.164 --> 02:05:07.685]   I really just don't have a view. I really don't know what to do about it all. I was
[02:05:07.685 --> 02:05:12.525]   going to call and ask you basically what, I mean everybody's being peaceful. I think
[02:05:12.525 --> 02:05:16.124]   that's the way it should be handled and everything. But what's our next move once they bust your
[02:05:16.124 --> 02:05:19.885]  teeth down your throat and run old ladies over with horses.
[02:05:20.598 --> 02:05:22.119]  Well, I mean, I hear you.
[02:05:22.319 --> 02:05:29.262]  The globalists want us to kill the cops, and then they start civil war, and then they sit back and watch the stocks plunge, and then they come in and buy them up cheap.
[02:05:29.702 --> 02:05:46.530]  I want to identify Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, the people running this, and then have everybody sue them, elect leaders that will then go after them, because if they just trigger a civil war and we don't involve ourselves, then their globalist system will fall.
[02:05:47.190 --> 02:05:54.705]   They're hoping they can turn up the heat Have an explosion and then bring in a permanent tyranny and we forget about how we got in that tyranny.
[02:05:55.245 --> 02:06:06.833]  So, yeah, it's very shameful to have the special police, and I say special, the average cops wouldn't do it, that they brought into Canada to attack men, women, and children and do all of this.
[02:06:07.473 --> 02:06:08.754]  They found their order followers.
[02:06:11.055 --> 02:06:17.897]  I really think they'll stage a false flag soon to demonize the protesters because without that they have really screwed themselves over.
[02:06:18.277 --> 02:06:21.657]  Trudeau was only elected with 30% of the vote again by a parliamentary trick.
[02:06:22.558 --> 02:06:25.398]  They're saying maybe he has 15% approval rating right now.
[02:06:26.019 --> 02:06:27.439]  So he's a total minion.
[02:06:27.479 --> 02:06:32.280]  That's why when he tries to shake Xi Jinping's hand or Bolsonaro's hand.
[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:36.481]  Bolsonaro is a great Christian patriot as good as you could get in my view.
[02:06:37.512 --> 02:06:49.416]  Xi Jinping's a super evil communist, but there's famous video where he tries to talk to both of them and tries to shake their hands, and they know he's owned by the UN and Klaus Schwab and BlackRock.
[02:06:50.336 --> 02:06:52.197]  And they're like, and that's how the Chinese are especially.
[02:06:52.977 --> 02:06:54.898]  If they know you're already somebody's puppet, they don't meet with you.
[02:06:55.658 --> 02:06:56.438]  They meet with the boss.
[02:06:57.078 --> 02:06:58.019]  Same thing with Bolsonaro.
[02:06:58.419 --> 02:06:59.679]  Go ahead and roll the footage again.
[02:07:00.199 --> 02:07:01.800]  And so he tries to talk to Xi Jinping.
[02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:02.640]  Xi Jinping won't talk to him.
[02:07:03.321 --> 02:07:04.501]  He tries to talk to Bolsonaro.
[02:07:06.598 --> 02:07:09.440]  Balsonaro won't talk to him.
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:12.922]  And that's because they know he's a puppet.
[02:07:13.022 --> 02:07:13.822]  Roll that footage again.
[02:07:13.842 --> 02:07:15.503]  I'm glad you were able to pull that up so quick.
[02:07:16.204 --> 02:07:18.525]  Because that perfectly illustrates.
[02:07:19.506 --> 02:07:20.526]  Yeah, back up to the beginning.
[02:07:20.686 --> 02:07:21.967]  Because he comes over and sits down.
[02:07:22.728 --> 02:07:23.168]  Yeah, here it is.
[02:07:24.248 --> 02:07:25.389]  Tries to talk to Xi Jinping.
[02:07:25.629 --> 02:07:26.410]  He won't talk to him.
[02:07:26.690 --> 02:07:27.450]  Touches his leg, won't.
[02:07:27.971 --> 02:07:29.051]  Okay, nobody's talking to me.
[02:07:29.832 --> 02:07:31.533]  Well, let me talk to Balsonaro.
[02:07:32.401 --> 02:07:36.544]  So you got the right-wing Christian on the one hand, the communist on the other, but they both run their countries.
[02:07:37.864 --> 02:07:39.245]  Oh no, I'm not talking to a puppet.
[02:07:40.946 --> 02:07:42.187]  You're bought and paid for, son.
[02:07:42.967 --> 02:07:45.209]  We don't talk, and it happens everywhere he goes.
[02:07:46.049 --> 02:07:47.010]  Trump wouldn't talk to him.
[02:07:48.188 --> 02:07:51.450]  Because no one respects a puppet.
[02:07:52.150 --> 02:07:53.390]  No one wants to be a puppet.
[02:07:53.431 --> 02:08:07.997]  You've got all the Brian Stelters in the world and leftist jockeying to be in positions of power and to get under CNN and get under ABC or get under NBC when they have dwindling audiences of idiots and everybody else hates them.
[02:08:09.938 --> 02:08:17.322]  It's joining a sinking ship, but they always aspire to that, they always believe that, and so they can't stop.
[02:08:18.735 --> 02:08:20.636]  Being a trailblazer is what you want.
[02:08:20.997 --> 02:08:22.618]  Being a maverick is what you want.
[02:08:22.998 --> 02:08:26.180]  Being a leader that stands up for the people, that's what's timeless.
[02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:31.103]  That's what honors your ancestors and your family and your progeny to come.
[02:08:31.123 --> 02:08:33.045]  That's what makes us strong.
[02:08:33.525 --> 02:08:35.947]  Our strength is people like Bolsonaro.
[02:08:36.867 --> 02:08:38.929]  Our strength is people like George Washington.
[02:08:39.609 --> 02:08:42.711]  Our strength is people that stand up for what's right.
[02:08:42.811 --> 02:08:43.772]  People like Martin Luther King Jr.
[02:08:44.853 --> 02:08:45.674]  That's our strength.
[02:08:45.714 --> 02:08:47.876]  Not bowing, not groveling.
[02:08:47.916 --> 02:08:50.918]  Everything we got was because of Free Society standing up.
[02:08:51.599 --> 02:08:55.923]  In fact, one of the crew pointed out that I should call somebody out, and I'll do it at the start of the next segment.
[02:08:57.584 --> 02:08:59.846]  And that's Drake, who I think has got great music, by the way.
[02:09:00.126 --> 02:09:00.807]  I love his music.
[02:09:01.368 --> 02:09:03.970]  Out of hip-hop and rap, I think he's one of the best talented people out there.
[02:09:04.951 --> 02:09:09.475]  I listen to him all the time, but the point is, is that, what's he doing for the people of Canada?
[02:09:10.387 --> 02:09:12.549]  He's all this rebel and this outsider and all this stuff.
[02:09:12.849 --> 02:09:25.198]  He's not doing nothing because he's being a bitch to his record label and the establishment just like that other dumbass Canadian up there who's been trying to make us all take the shots and wants Joe Rogan taken off Spotify.
[02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:27.360]  We all know his name.
[02:09:27.380 --> 02:09:28.121]  I don't even need to say it.
[02:09:30.042 --> 02:09:31.944]  Yeah, keep on rocking in the free world, alright?
[02:09:32.544 --> 02:09:33.905]  So let's go to Chris in Michigan.
[02:09:34.085 --> 02:09:34.666]  Chris, go ahead.
[02:09:37.116 --> 02:09:37.817]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[02:09:38.177 --> 02:09:39.838]  Yeah, you were there, you asked a question, I think.
[02:09:40.719 --> 02:09:41.560]  Did I answer it for you?
[02:09:42.841 --> 02:09:43.241]  You did.
[02:09:44.122 --> 02:09:45.803]  You could kill a thousand of those cops.
[02:09:45.843 --> 02:09:47.004]  That'd make the enemy more powerful.
[02:09:48.305 --> 02:09:49.786]  Well, you know, that's the thing.
[02:09:50.227 --> 02:09:53.109]  I'm so tired of taking the back seat and just sitting down.
[02:09:53.129 --> 02:09:53.790]  No, I know.
[02:09:53.810 --> 02:09:55.031]  So don't comply with the system.
[02:09:55.411 --> 02:09:56.312]  Expose the system.
[02:09:56.372 --> 02:09:57.112]  Wake people up.
[02:09:57.473 --> 02:09:58.613]  Say no to it at every level.
[02:09:59.094 --> 02:10:04.138]  And don't worry, if things keep deteriorating, Klaus Schwab gets a civil war, you're going to get every chance you want.
[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:06.461]  It'll all be a big crazy free-for-all.
[02:10:06.681 --> 02:10:08.362]  It won't matter anymore what's going on.
[02:10:08.603 --> 02:10:09.623]  You'll all be animated.
[02:10:09.643 --> 02:10:11.725]  We'll be jumping around like gorillas killing each other.
[02:10:12.125 --> 02:10:12.866]  And we're so close.
[02:10:13.166 --> 02:10:18.750]  And hey, once we go into that game, I'm pretty sure I'll shed my skin and be a horrible creature.
[02:10:18.770 --> 02:10:21.812]  But the point is... No, not me, folks, but I know how to.
[02:10:22.192 --> 02:10:23.613]  The point is we want to stop that.
[02:10:23.633 --> 02:10:25.635]  We want to intellectually beat our enemies.
[02:10:25.695 --> 02:10:28.597]  Our enemies want a physical conflict because why?
[02:10:28.877 --> 02:10:31.279]  They're losing the hearts and minds.
[02:10:31.299 --> 02:10:31.919]  Does that make sense?
[02:10:32.860 --> 02:10:33.000]  Yes.
[02:10:35.202 --> 02:10:35.722]  Yes, it does.
[02:10:36.283 --> 02:10:45.907]  Hey, I want to give a shout out to your Survival X2, Shield X2, the Ultimate Fish Oil, the Super Male Vitality, the Bodies, and the Fiber Green Caps.
[02:10:45.967 --> 02:10:46.787]  I take them every day.
[02:10:47.087 --> 02:10:47.908]  They're the good stuff.
[02:10:48.128 --> 02:10:50.529]  Y'all get out there and get them for yourself and your family.
[02:10:50.749 --> 02:10:51.149]  You need them.
[02:10:51.529 --> 02:10:51.810]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:52.630]  Have a good rest of your day.
[02:10:52.650 --> 02:10:55.631]  Hey, brother, I appreciate you, and your question is so important because I agree with you.
[02:10:56.072 --> 02:11:07.396]   When I watch them beat up old ladies and knock people's teeth out and beat them with guns at a primitive level 1,000 years ago, 500 years ago, We'd have a George Washington pop up and we'd go kick their ass and they wouldn't act like that anymore.
[02:11:07.756 --> 02:11:10.756]  But you understand we got a bunch of brainwashed public that doesn't know what's going on.
[02:11:11.256 --> 02:11:13.077]  And so we've got to wake them up ahead of that.
[02:11:13.117 --> 02:11:13.537]  You understand?
[02:11:13.957 --> 02:11:21.618]  They lose when they beat us with billy clubs and run over women with horses if we don't attack back.
[02:11:21.938 --> 02:11:25.859]  Not because we're wimps, but because we realize these guys are just puppets.
[02:11:26.219 --> 02:11:32.420]  We want to burn the leaders that gave the orders, who think we'll be dumb and kill the cops, and then they win the game.
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:32.820]  You understand?
[02:11:36.897 --> 02:11:37.377]  God bless you.
[02:11:37.397 --> 02:11:38.618]  All right, I'm going to go to break.
[02:11:39.158 --> 02:11:40.778]  I'm going to come back with that challenge to Drake.
[02:11:41.738 --> 02:11:43.519]  And then we're going to go right back to your phone calls.
[02:11:43.539 --> 02:11:44.179]  And I'll finish up.
[02:11:44.199 --> 02:11:46.920]  I'm sure Celentia will let me steal 15 minutes of his great show.
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:48.200]  He was on fire last week.
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:50.061]  But I'm going to get to every one of these calls.
[02:11:50.121 --> 02:11:51.081]  Stacey's up next.
[02:11:52.162 --> 02:11:54.282]  And we got Rick.
[02:11:55.503 --> 02:11:58.263]  And we got Alan and George and Steve and Jake.
[02:11:58.283 --> 02:12:01.824]  We're going to get to all your calls straight ahead.
[02:12:01.904 --> 02:12:03.725]  Please fund me and keep me on air.
[02:12:05.106 --> 02:12:09.708]  Part of me just wants to go run off in the woods and say, Hey man, imagine if Alex Jones just disappeared.
[02:12:10.049 --> 02:12:11.209]  Like, Hey, I've done my thing.
[02:12:11.269 --> 02:12:12.750]  I did my tour 28 years.
[02:12:12.810 --> 02:12:13.290]  I'm out of here.
[02:12:14.611 --> 02:12:15.351]  But I can't do that.
[02:12:16.412 --> 02:12:19.894]  But then they can take me off air anyways, if I don't get a lot of money.
[02:12:20.532 --> 02:12:21.793]  Plus I got great products you need.
[02:12:21.813 --> 02:12:23.495]  So I want to thank you all for how far we've come.
[02:12:23.515 --> 02:12:25.056]  But you don't need me to tell you right now.
[02:12:25.136 --> 02:12:26.097]  You've been betting on this.
[02:12:26.137 --> 02:12:26.818]  You've been fighting.
[02:12:27.158 --> 02:12:28.979]  It's like having a baby that's eight and a half months pregnant.
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:30.261]  We're right there, folks.
[02:12:30.681 --> 02:12:33.323]  And you don't want to lose this right now.
[02:12:33.864 --> 02:12:34.925]  And we need to stay in the fight.

[02:13:03.734 --> 02:13:05.173]  This is fame, not clout.
[02:13:05.173 --> 02:13:05.815]  Texas.
[02:13:05.815 --> 02:13:06.694]  I'm too turnt up.
[02:13:06.694 --> 02:13:07.774]  Says it perfectly.
[02:13:07.774 --> 02:13:09.694]  Got a paddock on my wrist going nuts.
[02:13:09.694 --> 02:13:12.694]  So, Greg, you know, says he's against police brutality.
[02:13:12.759 --> 02:13:13.279]  That's good.
[02:13:13.359 --> 02:13:15.021]  I'm against it too.
[02:13:15.041 --> 02:13:17.743]  Drake says, you know, he's this big Canadian up there in Toronto.
[02:13:17.823 --> 02:13:24.688]  Where is Drake right now about what's been going on for four weeks in Canada over two years of tyranny?
[02:13:25.668 --> 02:13:26.129]  Seriously.
[02:13:26.429 --> 02:13:32.813]  Because, you know, you got Kanye West over there who I admire because he's got a lot of courage and has been demonized and attacked for the truth.
[02:13:33.194 --> 02:13:33.834]  He's not perfect.
[02:13:34.134 --> 02:13:34.895]  I'm not perfect either.
[02:13:36.656 --> 02:13:38.698]  And then you got people, you got Ice-T.
[02:13:41.249 --> 02:13:43.690]  Coming out against gun control in the new world order.
[02:13:44.311 --> 02:13:44.751]  That's good.
[02:13:44.791 --> 02:13:49.393]  These are powerful, important people that reach a lot of folks.
[02:13:49.413 --> 02:13:54.336]  I mean, I say people over about 50 don't listen to it, but I've been listening to it since I was a kid.
[02:13:54.656 --> 02:13:55.897]  Everybody below me listens to it.
[02:13:56.577 --> 02:13:59.278]  All these old white people, I think the Beatles are still popular.
[02:14:00.479 --> 02:14:03.100]  But I mean, you know, these are the Beatles of today.
[02:14:03.241 --> 02:14:04.181]  And where are they?
[02:14:05.262 --> 02:14:06.362]  Oh, you're all tough.
[02:14:06.402 --> 02:14:07.263]  You're all gangster.
[02:14:07.283 --> 02:14:08.183]  You're all with the people.
[02:14:08.904 --> 02:14:09.544]  Well, let's see it.
[02:14:11.237 --> 02:14:11.998]  Let's see it, right?
[02:14:13.179 --> 02:14:16.441]  Because what's going on in Canada and everywhere else is BS.
[02:14:18.883 --> 02:14:21.045]  No, but you don't see Snoop Dogg against this.
[02:14:21.085 --> 02:14:21.526]  He loves it.
[02:14:21.546 --> 02:14:22.386]  He's at the Super Bowl.
[02:14:22.727 --> 02:14:24.828]  You're all sold out to the system and you're a joke.
[02:14:27.070 --> 02:14:32.555]  And that's all I can say is your managers tell you don't get involved.
[02:14:33.902 --> 02:14:35.103]  Just sit there and clutch your money.
[02:14:35.843 --> 02:14:41.227]  If you don't have a free society to spend your money in, or you're in a nuclear war, Drake, it's not worth anything.
[02:14:41.607 --> 02:14:43.028]  You know, and Joe Rogan's a great guy.
[02:14:43.048 --> 02:14:44.509]  I've known Joe Rogan 23 years.
[02:14:45.229 --> 02:14:46.410]  Longer than that.
[02:14:46.590 --> 02:14:46.810]  23 years.
[02:14:47.570 --> 02:14:48.991]  And I always knew Joe was a great guy.
[02:14:50.893 --> 02:14:54.515]  And then I saw him about four years ago going with the system and I got in his face and said, you're wrong.
[02:14:56.092 --> 02:15:00.475]  And then Joe went for the truth the last few years because he finally realized it was true.
[02:15:00.516 --> 02:15:01.436]  And what happened to Joe?
[02:15:02.017 --> 02:15:03.118]  Well, I know the inside baseball.
[02:15:03.158 --> 02:15:05.059]  I told you he didn't make $100 million last year.
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:09.943]  He didn't make $200 million last year because he started talking about the truth.
[02:15:11.504 --> 02:15:13.065]  Joe found out about how big the truth is.
[02:15:13.085 --> 02:15:14.086]  Joe made a lot more than that.
[02:15:14.707 --> 02:15:15.567]  It's not about that money.
[02:15:16.108 --> 02:15:16.968]  That's just numbers.
[02:15:17.008 --> 02:15:17.769]  That's just symbols.
[02:15:18.650 --> 02:15:19.791]  The truth is what really matters.
[02:15:19.831 --> 02:15:25.195]  But now you see where we are and you see Joe on the great reset.
[02:15:26.161 --> 02:15:28.042]  You see Joe on the New World Order.
[02:15:30.163 --> 02:15:34.426]  And I just wonder who's been feeding him all that information.
[02:15:35.207 --> 02:15:41.490]  Because real mastery comes when you're there way before anybody else does it.
[02:15:41.911 --> 02:15:47.234]  And then you just step back once you've completed the mission and watch everybody else carry out the victory.
[02:15:48.555 --> 02:15:49.635]  And that's really what I want to do.
[02:15:52.137 --> 02:15:53.918]  But we're far from that victory at this point.
[02:15:55.520 --> 02:16:01.341]  But this crew, and this operation, and the listeners, you deserve the credit.
[02:16:01.381 --> 02:16:04.582]  I know you're not looking for the credit, but I need to tell you how you get the credit.
[02:16:06.062 --> 02:16:13.984]  Because you need to recognize how you change the world, and how we're on a fighting foot right now, and actually are winning.
[02:16:14.064 --> 02:16:16.645]  In a fight, they're 45, we're 55.
[02:16:18.565 --> 02:16:20.726]  Or a football game, we're 36, they're 30.
[02:16:23.387 --> 02:16:24.168]  We're 33, they're 27.
[02:16:24.288 --> 02:16:28.231]  I mean, we're right there, folks.
[02:16:29.031 --> 02:16:29.912]  We're in the game.
[02:16:29.972 --> 02:16:31.373]  We're in the lead, actually, right now.
[02:16:33.114 --> 02:16:46.705]  And if we just get in the zone and pray to God, that's how you get in the zone, and just don't care about what happens to our bodies, and we tell the truth, we're going to win and secure the next big push for our species into the future.
[02:16:46.945 --> 02:16:53.256]   And our children that are counting on us to man up, And stand up and be strong and win.
[02:16:55.457 --> 02:17:04.165]  And I get all your genetic memory is you get told to go kill some people, you're in a war, other soldiers show up, you kill them, you win, you secured the future for your women and children.
[02:17:05.726 --> 02:17:06.767]  Well, this is next level.
[02:17:07.588 --> 02:17:09.009]  Now you got to secure businesses.
[02:17:10.216 --> 02:17:11.956]  You got to secure information.
[02:17:11.976 --> 02:17:12.957]  You got to become informed.
[02:17:13.217 --> 02:17:14.417]  You got to secure leadership.
[02:17:15.037 --> 02:17:19.118]  And then if all that fails, we'll resort to the good old-fashioned killing.
[02:17:19.758 --> 02:17:22.239]  And I think you're going to find something, men that are looking to be men out there.
[02:17:23.179 --> 02:17:35.141]  When you start taking care of your kids, you start working hard, if you're looking to be a badass, if you're looking to be a killer, all of a sudden all these systems open up and now you're the killer you always wanted to be, except you don't want to be a killer anymore.
[02:17:36.221 --> 02:17:37.042]  You want to be a farmer.
[02:17:37.061 --> 02:17:39.061]  You want to be a builder.
[02:17:39.061 --> 02:17:43.740]  You want to be somebody that brings the species forward.
[02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:52.182]   And that desire of human destiny is spreading now across the world.
[02:17:52.182 --> 02:17:57.861]   And our influence far pierces beyond the major leaders we've affected here in the United
[02:17:57.861 --> 02:17:59.021]  States.
[02:17:58.996 --> 02:18:01.316]  Our collective will of this broadcast.
[02:18:01.576 --> 02:18:01.856]  You.
[02:18:02.477 --> 02:18:02.977]  Your will.
[02:18:03.337 --> 02:18:03.857]  Your prayer.
[02:18:04.337 --> 02:18:05.817]  Your force of your voice.
[02:18:06.157 --> 02:18:07.318]  That's what incantation means.
[02:18:07.338 --> 02:18:09.038]  Think of an incantation as some witch.
[02:18:09.058 --> 02:18:10.698]  Well, they have their incantations.
[02:18:10.978 --> 02:18:11.519]  We have ours.
[02:18:11.539 --> 02:18:13.259]  When you pray to God, that's an incantation.
[02:18:13.579 --> 02:18:15.580]  When you speak out for the truth, it's an incantation.
[02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:20.461]  It's the will of your voice like God spoke reality into existence.
[02:18:20.481 --> 02:18:21.161]  We are little g.
[02:18:21.941 --> 02:18:22.802]  It made the image of God.
[02:18:23.102 --> 02:18:28.024]  We speak it into existence now, and we have spoken the pro-human future into existence.
[02:18:28.525 --> 02:18:33.867]  We have spoken the intergalactic, interstellar, interdimensional existence into existence.
[02:18:35.328 --> 02:18:37.389]  We have already flipped the switch.
[02:18:38.750 --> 02:18:44.493]  We've already, through God's promise, ensured the survival of the species and next-level development.
[02:18:47.315 --> 02:18:50.478]  The only question is, how many people do we take with us?
[02:18:51.038 --> 02:18:54.021]  How many souls join us into the next level?
[02:18:54.462 --> 02:18:55.643]  On how many fall to the enemy?
[02:18:55.943 --> 02:19:03.490]  Those are precious souls that are literally going to be captured in the Phantom Zone with Satan for very long cycles.
[02:19:04.271 --> 02:19:07.394]  We've got to try to take as many of them with us as we can.
[02:19:09.727 --> 02:19:12.308]  And Hollywood knows this, and the whole satanic culture knows this.
[02:19:12.688 --> 02:19:22.793]  That's why they have movies like Poltergeist, where there's the, you know, the cult leader takes them out in the Arizona desert, and kills everybody to get their souls, to take their spirits with him, because he's demon possessed.
[02:19:22.873 --> 02:19:31.917]  And he's trying to get, he's trying to manipulate the little girl to get her spirit into the dimension to fool all those spirits to follow him into hell.
[02:19:34.638 --> 02:19:37.419]  Of course, they raped that little girl to death on the set of that movie.
[02:19:39.266 --> 02:19:39.946]  On the next movie.
[02:19:41.527 --> 02:19:42.408]  That's Hollywood for you.
[02:19:46.911 --> 02:19:49.432]  So what does that song say from the High Women?
[02:19:50.113 --> 02:19:51.033]  I'm gonna live forever.
[02:19:51.554 --> 02:19:52.594]  I'm gonna cross that river.
[02:19:53.655 --> 02:19:54.796]  I'm gonna reach tomorrow now.
[02:19:55.496 --> 02:19:57.037]  Don't let the darkness take them.
[02:19:57.917 --> 02:19:59.599]  Don't let them feel forsaken.
[02:20:00.099 --> 02:20:03.041]  Because even though... We'll play the song, we'll come back with your calls.
[02:20:03.461 --> 02:20:06.703]  Even though they're not forsaken, they feel forsaken.
[02:20:07.964 --> 02:20:09.065]  Go ahead and play the song after the break.
[02:20:09.085 --> 02:20:16.593]  It's important.
[02:20:16.833 --> 02:20:18.635]  I'm gonna live forever.
[02:20:19.035 --> 02:20:20.737]  I'm gonna cross that river.
[02:20:20.757 --> 02:20:23.499]  I'm gonna catch tomorrow now.
[02:20:25.762 --> 02:20:30.066]  You're gonna wanna hold me just like I always told you.
[02:20:30.366 --> 02:20:39.275]   You're gonna miss me when I'm I'm gonna live forever now.
[02:20:39.295 --> 02:20:40.836]  That's what you want, folks.
[02:20:40.715 --> 02:20:46.715]   Just be around Just like the songs I leave behind me
[02:20:46.715 --> 02:20:52.715]   I'm gonna live forever now That's what you want folks
[02:20:52.715 --> 02:21:01.715]   Good stuff Just thank God you're not tempted
[02:21:01.715 --> 02:21:05.709]   You're not, that's why I'm here That you're not a swab.
[02:21:05.869 --> 02:21:07.430]  More Trudeau.
[02:21:07.450 --> 02:21:13.514]  Don't let the darkness take them.
[02:21:13.574 --> 02:21:15.756]  Don't make them feel forsaken.
[02:21:15.836 --> 02:21:18.058]  Just lead them safely to the light.
[02:21:19.319 --> 02:21:23.162]  When this whole world is blown asunder.
[02:21:23.182 --> 02:21:27.105]  And all the stars fall from the sky.
[02:21:29.605 --> 02:21:45.692]  You see, interdimensionally, love, admiration, commitment is the most powerful energy in the universe.
[02:21:47.652 --> 02:21:50.874]  It transcends all time, all dimensions.
[02:21:52.556 --> 02:21:56.480]  And it's what the enemies of humanity hate more than anything.
[02:21:57.360 --> 02:22:05.047]  We're gonna go to break, and I promise, get to all the callers, like Rick, and Alan, and others that are patiently holding.
[02:22:05.827 --> 02:22:09.190]  In hour number four, then Gerald Cilente takes over.
[02:22:10.091 --> 02:22:16.076]  I love how the tyrannical attacks on these men, women, and children in Ottawa has now spurred the rebellion worldwide.
[02:22:16.116 --> 02:22:18.477]  We'll be right back.
[02:22:18.296 --> 02:22:19.296]  Stay with us.
[02:22:19.296 --> 02:22:34.296]  I don't want to set the world on fire.
[02:22:34.296 --> 02:22:42.296]  I just want to start a flame in your heart.
[02:22:42.296 --> 02:22:46.296]   Well, the last thing Putin said today in the speech, Owen will be covering it, come up
[02:22:46.296 --> 02:22:47.296]  in an hour.
[02:22:48.173 --> 02:22:48.253]  U.S.
[02:22:48.273 --> 02:22:56.319]  deployment of some weapons in Ukraine will mean they put a knife to Russia's throat, and he said we'll go ahead and recognize what was part of Russia forever.
[02:22:56.939 --> 02:22:58.660]  Eastern Ukraine, a small area of that.
[02:22:59.301 --> 02:23:01.022]  And if they don't like it, I guess he'll invade.
[02:23:01.202 --> 02:23:02.843]  That is where we're at right now.
[02:23:03.343 --> 02:23:06.145]  Let's go to your phone calls after my bout of preaching earlier.
[02:23:06.686 --> 02:23:08.407]  Let's go to Rick in California.
[02:23:08.447 --> 02:23:08.947]  You're on the air.
[02:23:08.806 --> 02:23:16.966]  Thank you, Rick.
[02:23:17.584 --> 02:23:18.084]  Thank you!
[02:23:18.344 --> 02:23:20.566]  We are in for war!
[02:23:21.307 --> 02:23:22.208]  What's on your mind, brother?
[02:23:23.028 --> 02:23:28.513]  Okay, so I just want to let you know, man, we're ready to go out here.
[02:23:28.974 --> 02:23:32.817]  I really think that, you know, everything's come full-fledged.
[02:23:35.771 --> 02:23:38.332]  What needs to happen to take back our freedom?
[02:23:38.712 --> 02:23:40.192]  You know, things are going to get kinetic.
[02:23:40.672 --> 02:23:46.714]  I don't think, from my forecast, I don't see anything getting better over here.
[02:23:47.454 --> 02:23:50.675]  These people, you've hit it on the head all day long.
[02:23:50.975 --> 02:23:52.015]  They don't know how to farm.
[02:23:52.275 --> 02:23:55.876]  They don't know how to do a whole lot of anything.
[02:23:55.936 --> 02:24:02.958]  To where what they're going to pull out of there to fix these problems is going to be far slim to no solution.
[02:24:03.418 --> 02:24:06.288]   So, I just want to say, We're ready.
[02:24:06.569 --> 02:24:07.993]  We're ready to take back our freedom.
[02:24:08.274 --> 02:24:11.804]  Canada just sparked up a big storm here in America.
[02:24:12.663 --> 02:24:19.309]  I'm telling you, these people, Drake, whoever these people are, they're hiding in the hills.
[02:24:19.409 --> 02:24:22.232]  The fight's coming to their front door real soon.
[02:24:22.452 --> 02:24:24.033]  There's not going to be anyone to save them.
[02:24:24.353 --> 02:24:26.135]  There's not going to be anyone to save them.
[02:24:26.255 --> 02:24:27.656]  They said defund the police.
[02:24:27.937 --> 02:24:28.697]  Well, guess what?
[02:24:28.897 --> 02:24:30.319]  The police are on our side.
[02:24:30.779 --> 02:24:31.520]  We the people.
[02:24:31.740 --> 02:24:34.803]  They haven't forgot who the people who turned the backs are.
[02:24:35.223 --> 02:24:35.643]  Guess what?
[02:24:35.683 --> 02:24:36.945]  They're still in the neighborhood.
[02:24:37.245 --> 02:24:39.367]  They may not be in a job right now.
[02:24:39.967 --> 02:24:40.348]  Active.
[02:24:40.628 --> 02:24:41.248]  But guess what?
[02:24:41.268 --> 02:24:41.749]  We're ready.
[02:24:42.149 --> 02:24:43.030]  Everybody's ready.
[02:24:43.330 --> 02:24:46.252]  And until that push comes to shove, let's get kinetic.
[02:24:46.652 --> 02:24:47.233]  Let's do it.
[02:24:48.053 --> 02:24:48.694]  I hear you, brother.
[02:24:48.734 --> 02:24:52.777]  That's why Klaus Schwab and them thought they would cause a civil war and that we would never blame them.
[02:24:52.817 --> 02:24:54.078]  No, we blame the globalists.
[02:24:54.638 --> 02:24:57.280]  We blame the leadership, the Democrat and Republican Party.
[02:24:57.741 --> 02:24:58.581]  And they need to know that.
[02:24:58.621 --> 02:24:59.182]  God bless you.
[02:24:59.202 --> 02:24:59.822]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:00.242 --> 02:25:01.603]  Let's jam in another one here right now.
[02:25:01.623 --> 02:25:04.345]  I appreciate everybody holding, who's holding the longest here.
[02:25:04.366 --> 02:25:05.246]  Let's talk to Alan.
[02:25:06.107 --> 02:25:07.148]  Alan in Pennsylvania.
[02:25:07.188 --> 02:25:07.468]  Go ahead.
[02:25:08.849 --> 02:25:09.469]  Oh, hi, Alex.
[02:25:09.509 --> 02:25:10.750]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:11.671]  Honor to talk to you, brother.
[02:25:11.691 --> 02:25:12.471]  What's on your mind today?
[02:25:13.552 --> 02:25:17.674]  I just wanted to let you know how you have helped me through this past few years.
[02:25:18.214 --> 02:25:35.344]  I've been, you know, confused in a trance, even, and, you know, watching the news and, you know, nothing making sense and feeling alone and finally finding the truth or a voice to help me and, you know, everyone around me to, you know, you feel like you're not alone.
[02:25:36.608 --> 02:25:37.248]  Exactly, brother.
[02:25:37.268 --> 02:25:40.249]  You're not alone, and we're over the target.
[02:25:40.309 --> 02:25:41.350]  I mean, we know what we're talking about.
[02:25:41.370 --> 02:25:42.190]  Anybody can check it out.
[02:25:42.930 --> 02:25:47.752]  What do you think about just the vaccines turning out to be poison, the huge awakening happening right now?
[02:25:47.772 --> 02:25:48.632]  I mean, it's a big one.
[02:25:48.952 --> 02:25:52.154]  They hope we just forget about the last two years, what they did to us.
[02:25:52.214 --> 02:25:53.054]  I don't see that happening.
[02:25:54.522 --> 02:26:06.774]  Yeah, I don't see how that could happen with the mask on the children and, you know, just the effect it's had on them, the suicide, the, you know, even the targeted transgenderism through, you know, homeschooling, I think.
[02:26:07.608 --> 02:26:11.710]  You know, I just, I can't forgive the past years, what they've done to me and my family.
[02:26:11.730 --> 02:26:18.214]  And whether, no matter whether it's in Europe or here, oh, we didn't tell you your elementary girls will be sleeping with men.
[02:26:18.234 --> 02:26:19.735]  It's no big deal.
[02:26:19.755 --> 02:26:20.576]  It's liberal.
[02:26:20.876 --> 02:26:23.077]  Their whole religion is pedophilia.
[02:26:23.377 --> 02:26:27.460]  That's why it's all deceptive and sneaky, and it's destroying our future.
[02:26:28.620 --> 02:26:30.041]  It's destroying civilization.
[02:26:30.181 --> 02:26:33.123]  You know, the Facebook, the Twitter, the Instagram, all of it.
[02:26:33.683 --> 02:26:48.182]   I think it needs to go, and I think we need to go back to You know, one-on-one conversations and, you know, just trusting each other and believing in each other and, you know, trying to come together as a people.
[02:26:49.176 --> 02:26:49.917]  I totally agree.
[02:26:49.957 --> 02:26:50.837]  God bless you, Ellen.
[02:26:50.977 --> 02:26:51.338]  All right.
[02:26:52.158 --> 02:26:53.299]  George in Canada.
[02:26:53.359 --> 02:26:54.039]  You're up next.
[02:26:54.099 --> 02:26:56.561]  Then Stacey, Jake and Steve.
[02:26:56.601 --> 02:27:01.204]  Then the one, the only Gerald Cilente, loaded for bear, always fired up.
[02:27:01.224 --> 02:27:03.806]  The top trends forecaster takes over today.
[02:27:03.906 --> 02:27:07.288]  And then in 55 minutes from now, Owen Schroyer.
[02:27:07.328 --> 02:27:12.492]  He's got Marjorie Taylor Greene in studio interview.
[02:27:12.712 --> 02:27:13.112]  That's right.
[02:27:13.132 --> 02:27:14.113]  She was here last night with me.
[02:27:14.373 --> 02:27:15.454]  She's with Owen today.
[02:27:17.188 --> 02:27:21.471]  Alright, we're gonna go to Stacey, we're gonna go to Jake, we're gonna go to Steve, we're gonna go to George.
[02:27:22.612 --> 02:27:29.236]  Remember, God is in control of all of this, and we're just blown away and blessed to be in the presence of the Great Spirit.
[02:27:30.196 --> 02:27:35.239]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Canada, then Stacey.
[02:27:35.299 --> 02:27:36.000]  George, go ahead.
[02:27:37.020 --> 02:27:37.581]  Yes, Al.
[02:27:38.365 --> 02:27:44.349]  I've been listening to you for ages, almost 25 years myself, and I've been going after things.
[02:27:44.769 --> 02:27:53.335]  What I'm saying today is about, I was going to start off about the mayors, and the mayor in Ottawa, right?
[02:27:53.455 --> 02:27:54.695]  And his controls on that.
[02:27:54.775 --> 02:27:55.776]  Yeah, the Ford.
[02:27:55.796 --> 02:27:58.058]  You know, watch it, isn't it?
[02:27:59.378 --> 02:28:05.002]  There's a bunch of them, I guess Ford's... Yeah, well anyway, that's just one... Oh, that's the premier of Quebec is, yeah, Ford.
[02:28:06.252 --> 02:28:09.714]  Yeah, okay, and then there's like Toronto, right?
[02:28:10.234 --> 02:28:11.514]  And all these other places.
[02:28:12.355 --> 02:28:18.157]  So, I would ask you, if you could, because those connections are with everything.
[02:28:18.838 --> 02:28:21.059]  Including their head of chief of police.
[02:28:21.379 --> 02:28:22.199]  And it's the same.
[02:28:22.759 --> 02:28:27.802]  Now, each one of those, there are just hundreds of mayors.
[02:28:28.182 --> 02:28:31.743]  Each one is connected through what's called the FCM.
[02:28:32.144 --> 02:28:35.145]  But what I want you to look up, because you're going to get a real surprise.
[02:28:36.070 --> 02:28:38.171]  Is Big City Mayor's Caucus.
[02:28:38.411 --> 02:28:40.431]  B-C-M-C.
[02:28:41.271 --> 02:28:41.691]  Okay?
[02:28:41.851 --> 02:28:47.873]  So I've been fighting this for years, and I've been threatened enough times, and I just want to get this out.
[02:28:49.053 --> 02:28:51.234]  You know, so... Well, you're here.
[02:28:51.874 --> 02:28:54.834]  No, I mean, I remember Schwarzenegger, like, ten years ago, was at the UN meeting.
[02:28:54.854 --> 02:29:02.596]  He goes, we cannot get the carbon tax through, so we take over the cities and the towns, and we implement... Ah!
[02:29:03.196 --> 02:29:04.177]  And that's what they've done.
[02:29:04.237 --> 02:29:05.357]  It's called munilization.
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:07.280]  Yeah.
[02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:09.461]  What do Canadians think of all the U.N.
[02:29:09.501 --> 02:29:13.843]  aircraft in the East, the West, just giant U.N.
[02:29:13.923 --> 02:29:16.965]  jets everywhere, landing at the airports?
[02:29:17.645 --> 02:29:27.150]  If you could look that up, really, I've been banned by the Tourist Star, I'm banned by most of my counselors, and I'm banned by a lot of other people.
[02:29:27.730 --> 02:29:39.840]   But this has been, I've been banned by Toronto Star, or my regular Uh, by going on 16 years now, because I mentioned Agenda 21, and I've been banned since.
[02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:41.521]  Well, brother, God bless you.
[02:29:41.541 --> 02:29:42.562]  I appreciate your call.
[02:29:42.942 --> 02:29:43.602]  Keep fighting.
[02:29:44.143 --> 02:29:46.824]  All right, let's talk to Stacey in Alabama.
[02:29:46.864 --> 02:29:47.545]  Welcome, Stacey.
[02:29:49.126 --> 02:29:49.766]  Hi, Alex.
[02:29:50.247 --> 02:29:58.452]  Um, my question is, is that when Russia, you, like, invades Ukraine, what kind of effect is it going to have on us?
[02:29:58.928 --> 02:30:00.729]  Like, what do we need to do to prepare?
[02:30:00.749 --> 02:30:04.070]  What are we going to see when this does happen?
[02:30:05.991 --> 02:30:07.752]  Your phone's a little bit echoey.
[02:30:07.772 --> 02:30:10.133]  Say that again?
[02:30:10.153 --> 02:30:10.753]  Okay.
[02:30:10.773 --> 02:30:18.497]  So, when Russia invades Ukraine, and you know what's going to happen, what is that, how is that going to affect us here?
[02:30:18.837 --> 02:30:21.718]  Like, what's going to happen to all of us here?
[02:30:22.239 --> 02:30:26.552]   Are we going to see A big change in the economy here?
[02:30:26.752 --> 02:30:28.332]  What does it mean for us?
[02:30:28.452 --> 02:30:28.772]  I mean, no.
[02:30:29.232 --> 02:30:30.013]  That's a good question.
[02:30:30.153 --> 02:30:33.374]  Already, Biden says gas prices are up because of Putin.
[02:30:33.394 --> 02:30:34.014]  That's not true.
[02:30:34.334 --> 02:30:35.734]  It's dollar devaluation.
[02:30:35.854 --> 02:30:37.055]  It's shutting down pipelines.
[02:30:38.475 --> 02:30:48.078]  But if they just let Putin take over the eastern area of Ukraine, and they start a peace deal, then it'll just go away.
[02:30:48.158 --> 02:30:51.239]  But if they can start a larger war, I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:30:51.279 --> 02:30:52.319]  I don't know what's going to unfold.
[02:30:54.492 --> 02:31:01.314]  So it is, but that's what I'm just kind of, you know, I've been sitting here watching the news and I'm definitely, you know, I'm definitely keeping an eye on it.
[02:31:01.394 --> 02:31:02.334]  Sure, I'm in the same boat.
[02:31:03.334 --> 02:31:04.715]  I don't know what's going to unfold.
[02:31:05.295 --> 02:31:08.015]  I don't think the people that control Biden know.
[02:31:08.616 --> 02:31:09.696]  I don't think Putin knows.
[02:31:09.796 --> 02:31:14.397]  I don't think, I mean, this is all, Russia doesn't want Western forces up on their border.
[02:31:14.917 --> 02:31:17.418]  Whether you agree with Russia or not, that's the reality of this.
[02:31:17.918 --> 02:31:20.499]  And so they're still sovereign countries the globalists don't control.
[02:31:20.959 --> 02:31:21.839]  That's why they're so upset.
[02:31:23.291 --> 02:31:27.083]  Okay, do you think that we, like the U.S., is definitely antagonizing this war?
[02:31:27.123 --> 02:31:28.186]  Do you think we're kind of...
[02:31:28.937 --> 02:31:30.878]  Well, I mean, it's not even the U.S.
[02:31:31.139 --> 02:31:35.661]  We're like a quasi-globalist-run system that they use and control.
[02:31:36.922 --> 02:31:39.304]  But yeah, obviously the West believes it owns the world.
[02:31:39.744 --> 02:31:43.066]  The people that own us, that have taken over America, believe they own us.
[02:31:43.486 --> 02:31:44.787]  They believe they own everybody else.
[02:31:44.807 --> 02:31:48.309]  They believe they own the Chinese through the Communists they put in charge.
[02:31:48.349 --> 02:31:50.511]  Now the Communists have double-crossed them.
[02:31:50.551 --> 02:31:52.572]  So, it's not like I'm endorsing Xi Jinping.
[02:31:52.612 --> 02:31:54.193]  I'm just saying he's now double-crossing them.
[02:31:54.233 --> 02:31:56.254]  So, that's the reality of what's going on.
[02:31:56.314 --> 02:31:56.935]  Thank you for the call.
[02:31:57.495 --> 02:31:58.256]  Really good questions.
[02:31:59.056 --> 02:32:01.158]  Let's talk to Steve in North Dakota.
[02:32:01.638 --> 02:32:03.579]  Steve, Russia-Ukraine conflict.
[02:32:03.619 --> 02:32:04.180]  What's your take?
[02:32:05.500 --> 02:32:09.463]  Well, first I gotta say, you were talking about music.
[02:32:09.663 --> 02:32:11.484]  Check out Kid Rock's new song, Weed the People.
[02:32:11.825 --> 02:32:12.265]  Great song.
[02:32:12.345 --> 02:32:13.206]  I love that song.
[02:32:13.246 --> 02:32:14.406]  I meant to play that last week.
[02:32:14.466 --> 02:32:15.087]  It's awesome.
[02:32:16.055 --> 02:32:16.655]  Yeah.
[02:32:16.695 --> 02:32:19.737]  But you think about it, I don't think Putin wants Ukraine.
[02:32:20.098 --> 02:32:29.223]  I think he wants to go in there and clean up the corruption, get rid of the Gazirian mafia, because that's where all the deep state, Biden, Pelosi, Kerry, they all... Yeah, no, he said that.
[02:32:29.263 --> 02:32:30.544]  He said, be your own country.
[02:32:30.564 --> 02:32:31.765]  He said, don't be part of Europe.
[02:32:32.685 --> 02:32:34.967]  Don't be controlled by NATO and don't be controlled by Russia.
[02:32:35.327 --> 02:32:36.428]  We don't want to run you.
[02:32:36.828 --> 02:32:37.969]  Just stop it.
[02:32:38.969 --> 02:32:40.570]  That's where all those skeletons are buried.
[02:32:42.572 --> 02:32:44.493]  And they don't want Putin to uncover the skeletons.
[02:32:46.135 --> 02:32:48.235]  I may have an audio problem today.
[02:32:48.996 --> 02:32:49.876]  My earpiece or whatever.
[02:32:49.896 --> 02:32:51.156]  I'm in trouble understanding the callers.
[02:32:51.756 --> 02:32:52.536]  Say that again.
[02:32:53.256 --> 02:32:53.736]  Can you hear me?
[02:32:53.836 --> 02:32:54.997]  I can hear you now.
[02:32:55.037 --> 02:32:56.357]  Say it again.
[02:32:56.777 --> 02:33:02.398]  John Kerry, Pelosi, Biden, they all got kids getting high-paying jobs in Ukraine.
[02:33:03.138 --> 02:33:03.618]  No, no.
[02:33:03.678 --> 02:33:04.278]  Well said.
[02:33:04.358 --> 02:33:04.798]  Well said.
[02:33:04.838 --> 02:33:05.638]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:33:05.698 --> 02:33:06.138]  Great point.
[02:33:06.779 --> 02:33:07.099]  All right.
[02:33:07.199 --> 02:33:07.999]  Jake in Illinois.
[02:33:08.039 --> 02:33:10.579]  Last caller before Gerald Solente takes over.
[02:33:10.599 --> 02:33:11.279]  What's on your mind?
[02:33:12.499 --> 02:33:13.740]  Hey, good talking to you again, man.
[02:33:14.260 --> 02:33:14.800]  Good talking to you.
[02:33:14.820 --> 02:33:15.200]  Go ahead.
[02:33:16.341 --> 02:33:23.045]  I just wanted to say, I think the whole Russia-Ukraine situation is kind of the same as China-Taiwan.
[02:33:23.565 --> 02:33:26.166]  The only difference is you don't hear about China-Taiwan on the news.
[02:33:27.627 --> 02:33:28.488]  That's a good point.
[02:33:28.528 --> 02:33:29.928]  Yeah, you never hear about that.
[02:33:30.809 --> 02:33:32.950]  Yeah, also, they're kind of owned by China.
[02:33:33.270 --> 02:33:43.896]  But I mean, I kind of believe also that AUKUS and China and Russia, I mean, there's a joint alliance between China and Russia to take what's theirs as in Taiwan and Ukraine.
[02:33:44.628 --> 02:33:54.531]  So, I mean, I kind of think AUKUS is kind of working with them, with the global elitists, and they're going to use this as a false flag to do whatever they want.
[02:33:54.671 --> 02:33:58.672]  You know, they nuke the United States, but oh, it's Russia, or they shut down our power, oh, it's Russia.
[02:33:59.532 --> 02:34:02.593]  You know, but at the same time, it's just advancing their strategy.
[02:34:03.994 --> 02:34:07.396]   I also wanted to talk about how There's no 5G in Mexico.
[02:34:07.416 --> 02:34:14.782]  I think that kind of goes hand in hand with Bill Gates owning all his farmland, probably selling it to high intel Chinese people.
[02:34:15.143 --> 02:34:18.305]  I think they're going to try to move us down there after they do something crazy.
[02:34:20.437 --> 02:34:27.282]  I really think they're just going to plan to go to like Argentina, New York, Antarctica, kind of like the Nazis were planning on when they wanted to do a world war.
[02:34:27.602 --> 02:34:28.183]  Well, that's right.
[02:34:28.203 --> 02:34:33.086]  I mean, it always begins with taking a small area and setting the precedent and grabbing more, more, more.
[02:34:33.126 --> 02:34:35.028]  That's how World War One began, World War Two.
[02:34:35.808 --> 02:34:37.850]  And I'm not defending everything the Russians are doing.
[02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:39.451]  I'm just pointing out the reality of it.
[02:34:40.431 --> 02:34:46.671]   In the case, the Russians aren't devil-worshipping, child-molester communists like the Hollywood,
[02:34:46.671 --> 02:34:48.870]  and the Chinese are still super-evil communists.
[02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:53.310]   So when they're taking over Hong Kong or Taiwan and breaking agreements, I'm against it.
[02:34:53.310 --> 02:34:58.711]   But when Russia historically is taking over an area it's controlled and the West is attacking
[02:34:58.711 --> 02:35:05.031]   it, and the West is literally coming to take Russian testicles as scalps, their religion,
[02:35:05.031 --> 02:35:09.110]   of the left, like they do here, it's hard to side against Russia.
[02:35:09.357 --> 02:35:11.300]  But regardless, I believe in the Monroe Doctrine.
[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:14.864]  If Russians were on our border doing this, I'd be saying go to war with Russia.
[02:35:14.904 --> 02:35:15.425]  But they're not.
[02:35:15.445 --> 02:35:16.065]  Does that make sense?
[02:35:17.267 --> 02:35:19.650]  Yeah, I mean, but we're kind of doing the same thing to China.
[02:35:19.930 --> 02:35:21.292]  I mean, they're controlled, obviously.
[02:35:21.312 --> 02:35:25.297]  It kind of looks like they're backing away from the New World Order.
[02:35:26.357 --> 02:35:29.542]  I mean, the Korean-Vietnam War, I mean... So what do you propose happens?
[02:35:29.582 --> 02:35:31.184]  I mean, I'm just trying to... So what are you saying?
[02:35:31.204 --> 02:35:33.427]  I mean, I know all these sides are fighting with each other.
[02:35:34.208 --> 02:35:35.630]  What should happen?
[02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:36.852]  They don't get the blame.
[02:35:37.473 --> 02:35:39.896]  But I basically think they're just going to use it as control.
[02:35:40.156 --> 02:35:42.039]  I think Putin's kind of being put on the hot seat.
[02:35:43.213 --> 02:35:46.935]  Yeah, because they don't like sovereign countries.
[02:35:46.975 --> 02:35:47.475]  I agree with you.
[02:35:47.776 --> 02:35:48.656]  Thanks for the call, brother.
[02:35:49.156 --> 02:35:51.077]  Wow, a lot of amazing calls today.
[02:35:51.097 --> 02:35:53.959]  Owen Schroer comes up in 45 minutes.
[02:35:54.419 --> 02:35:57.461]  Gerald Cilente, the top trends forecaster, was on fire last week.
[02:35:57.761 --> 02:36:00.082]  He's always amazing, but particularly on fire last week.
[02:36:00.442 --> 02:36:02.483]  He is about to take over on the other side of this quick break.
[02:36:02.864 --> 02:36:07.046]  Please remember, I cannot finance this operation without your prayers, your support.

[02:36:30.466 --> 02:36:37.745]  the sale on Deep Earth Crystal Iodine at 50% off X3.

[02:36:37.882 --> 02:36:42.063]  That sale's about to end, and thank you for going to the site and supporting us.
[02:36:42.083 --> 02:36:44.764]  You've changed the world by keeping us on air.
[02:36:44.804 --> 02:36:46.344]  This is a lot bigger than Alex Jones.
[02:36:46.704 --> 02:36:51.086]  It's about all the other great guests, and all the great hosts, and the great crew, and you, the listeners.
[02:36:51.386 --> 02:36:52.686]  We love you and appreciate you.
[02:36:52.505 --> 02:36:54.505]  General Cemente takes over.
[02:36:54.505 --> 02:37:01.505]  [Music]
[02:37:01.505 --> 02:37:03.505]  So I did it.
[02:37:02.771 --> 02:37:04.872]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[02:37:05.032 --> 02:37:12.256]  I've been training, probably not as much as I should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:37:12.556 --> 02:37:18.359]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some Turbo Force to give me that energy I need to get going.
[02:37:18.379 --> 02:37:31.585]   You know, besides the energy, Turbo Force It is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[02:37:31.965 --> 02:37:35.487]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones Soreless.
[02:37:35.827 --> 02:37:36.727]  I have bad joints.
[02:37:37.047 --> 02:37:37.687]  Thanks, Mom.
[02:37:37.948 --> 02:37:44.830]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[02:37:45.030 --> 02:37:49.012]  The quick-release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[02:37:49.452 --> 02:37:52.974]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news!
[02:37:53.174 --> 02:38:00.318]  TurboForce, that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and Sorelis can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[02:38:00.758 --> 02:38:03.140]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:11.764]  Listen everybody, you better support InfoWars because the way we're losing our freedom, freedom of speech?
[02:38:12.324 --> 02:38:13.185]  Forget about it!
[02:38:13.931 --> 02:38:15.912]  Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?
[02:38:16.252 --> 02:38:18.032]  Who the hell are you to be happy?
[02:38:18.432 --> 02:38:19.793]  Don't you know who I am?
[02:38:20.333 --> 02:38:23.854]  I'm your little dictator, over here, over there, I'll tell you what to do!
[02:38:24.274 --> 02:38:24.975]  Yeah, lock up!
[02:38:25.015 --> 02:38:26.475]  We're gonna shelter in place!
[02:38:26.955 --> 02:38:28.676]  We're gonna flatten the curve!
[02:38:29.176 --> 02:38:30.396]  Remember that crap?
[02:38:30.817 --> 02:38:35.258]  Spewing out of these little low-life pieces of scum crap?
[02:38:36.198 --> 02:38:38.159]  Oh, that was only two years ago, Cilenti!
[02:38:39.361 --> 02:38:40.822]  Oh, and they did a great job!
[02:38:41.122 --> 02:38:42.362]  They flattened the curve.
[02:38:42.743 --> 02:38:52.007]  They flattened the lives of we, the little people of Slavelandia, as the big got bigger, the rich got richer.
[02:38:53.267 --> 02:39:01.411]  Merger and acquisition activity at all-time highs, median household income, sharpest declines since recorded records.
[02:39:03.312 --> 02:39:04.032]  Flattened the curve.
[02:39:04.052 --> 02:39:06.353]  We got a bunch of low-life scum.
[02:39:07.267 --> 02:39:09.108]  That's in charge of our lives.
[02:39:11.928 --> 02:39:13.269]  In a country near you.
[02:39:14.609 --> 02:39:15.589]  So let's look at this.
[02:39:17.170 --> 02:39:23.411]  You know, they may take Alex Jones off the air, even on his own network over here, for what I have to say right now.
[02:39:24.672 --> 02:39:25.572]  So be prepared.
[02:39:25.592 --> 02:39:28.733]  A celebration.
[02:39:28.753 --> 02:39:30.993]  Oh, is this Washington's Day?
[02:39:31.674 --> 02:39:32.934]  Of George Washington?
[02:39:33.786 --> 02:39:38.249]  Yeah, let's celebrate George- Why, how dare you celebrate George Washington?
[02:39:38.670 --> 02:39:40.271]  What kind of president was he?
[02:39:40.291 --> 02:39:47.408]   You mean a guy that- You know, went across the Delaware over there with the troops and fought for freedom and independence?
[02:39:47.808 --> 02:39:49.690]  Well, I'm a little Obama!
[02:39:50.130 --> 02:39:52.151]  I'm a little Clinton lowlife!
[02:39:52.451 --> 02:39:54.312]  No, I'm a little Georgie Bush!
[02:39:54.612 --> 02:39:56.974]  A little daddy's boy born on third base!
[02:39:57.234 --> 02:39:58.415]  A little piece of crap!
[02:39:58.835 --> 02:39:59.795]  No, no, no, no!
[02:39:59.956 --> 02:40:01.056]  I'm Joe Biden!
[02:40:01.516 --> 02:40:04.238]  Hey, any of you guys fight like Washington?
[02:40:06.459 --> 02:40:09.321]  Could any of you guys go to war if you're declaring war?
[02:40:09.841 --> 02:40:10.602]  Fat mouths!
[02:40:14.341 --> 02:40:15.622]  You want to declare war?
[02:40:16.563 --> 02:40:17.263]  Go to war!
[02:40:17.984 --> 02:40:20.606]  Lead the war, or shut your mouth!
[02:40:21.827 --> 02:40:25.429]  And send yourself, your wife, and your kids!
[02:40:26.530 --> 02:40:27.291]  Lead the charge!
[02:40:27.391 --> 02:40:29.072]  Oh yeah, your wives could all- Hey!
[02:40:29.292 --> 02:40:30.473]  Hey, they're strong now!
[02:40:30.513 --> 02:40:30.933]  Yeah!
[02:40:31.173 --> 02:40:33.195]  You could put them right out in front, man!
[02:40:33.215 --> 02:40:34.276]  Oh, women!
[02:40:34.916 --> 02:40:36.557]  Oh yeah, fight away your kids!
[02:40:37.058 --> 02:40:37.698]  What kids?
[02:40:38.078 --> 02:40:39.219]  They're not kids anymore!
[02:40:39.439 --> 02:40:40.540]  They're grown-up nothings!
[02:40:40.620 --> 02:40:41.401]  Put them out there!
[02:40:42.441 --> 02:40:53.026]  You want to talk about war, anybody that wants to talk about war, go to war, or go to hell, because I've had it with you clowns.
[02:40:53.846 --> 02:40:58.148]  Washington's birthday, or celebration of Washington's day, here we go.
[02:40:59.409 --> 02:41:03.390]  This is Washington's farewell address, part of it.
[02:41:06.912 --> 02:41:19.608]   He goes on to say, the nation which indulges toward another An habitual hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave.
[02:41:20.549 --> 02:41:21.150]  You got it?
[02:41:22.431 --> 02:41:23.472]  We're Americans!
[02:41:25.675 --> 02:41:30.057]  No foreign entanglements, you little war-mongering freaks!
[02:41:30.577 --> 02:41:34.619]  How about the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, Barack Obama?
[02:41:34.719 --> 02:41:35.320]  I love him.
[02:41:35.580 --> 02:41:38.521]  He was... Salenti, you should learn how to talk like him.
[02:41:39.021 --> 02:41:42.603]  Folks, we're gonna keep folking you all the time.
[02:41:43.003 --> 02:41:46.125]  Every time I say folks, you know what it means, folks.
[02:41:46.545 --> 02:41:48.746]  But you gotta be proper like Obama.
[02:41:49.146 --> 02:41:57.762]   Don't get angry for murdering those Libyans, the richest country in Africa, Qaddafi has to go.
[02:41:58.383 --> 02:42:00.204]  Quoted in the book, Double Down.
[02:42:00.224 --> 02:42:02.785]  I'm really good at killing people.
[02:42:03.286 --> 02:42:05.147]  Don't get excited, Salenti.
[02:42:05.587 --> 02:42:08.949]  Be a murderous piece of Nobel crap prize winner.
[02:42:09.250 --> 02:42:10.591]  Maybe you could get one.
[02:42:10.891 --> 02:42:13.052]  Get rid of your Occupy Peace movement.
[02:42:14.113 --> 02:42:16.274]  How dare you, Salenti, want peace?
[02:42:16.775 --> 02:42:17.975]  We're warmongers.
[02:42:18.616 --> 02:42:22.779]  Not a peep about peace, and not a peep about peace and the prostitutes.
[02:42:23.279 --> 02:42:24.580]  Prostitute days.
[02:42:25.410 --> 02:42:26.070]  That's right.
[02:42:28.031 --> 02:42:28.551]  Here you go.
[02:42:28.811 --> 02:42:30.111]  Really good at killing people.
[02:42:30.231 --> 02:42:30.631]  Folks.
[02:42:31.411 --> 02:42:31.791]  Folks.
[02:42:32.672 --> 02:42:34.152]  Yep, he never stopped folkin'.
[02:42:35.452 --> 02:42:36.232]  He goes on.
[02:42:38.773 --> 02:42:40.233]  This is from Wikipedia.
[02:42:41.174 --> 02:42:55.443]   Washington continues to express his support of the Union by giving some examples of how he believes that the country, its regions, and its people are already benefiting from the unity which they currently share.
[02:42:55.463 --> 02:43:18.409]  He then looks to the future in his belief that the combined effort and resources of its people will protect the country from foreign attack and allow them to avoid wars between neighboring nations that often happen due to rivalries and competing relations with foreign nations.
[02:43:19.429 --> 02:43:42.580]  He argues that the security provided by the Union will also allow the United States to avoid the creation of an overgrown military, which he sees as a great threat to liberty, especially the Republican liberty which the United States has created.
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:44.541]  That's out of Wikipedia.
[02:43:44.901 --> 02:43:46.222]  Afraid of the military?
[02:43:46.242 --> 02:43:46.282]  Oh!
[02:43:47.924 --> 02:44:23.440]   I guess it took how many years for Dwight D. Eisenhower, five-star general, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, two-term president, January 17, 1961, farewell address, warning the American people that the military-industrial complex Has robbed the nation of the genius of the scientists, the sweat of the laborers, and the future of the children.
[02:44:24.841 --> 02:44:26.342]  Screw Washington!
[02:44:27.063 --> 02:44:28.424]  Hell with Eisenhower!
[02:44:28.704 --> 02:44:30.285]  I'm Mad Dog Madness!
[02:44:30.566 --> 02:44:31.326]  Ooh!
[02:44:32.547 --> 02:44:32.607]  Ooh!
[02:44:33.128 --> 02:44:35.470]  Yeah, Mad Dog Madness, all right?
[02:44:35.870 --> 02:44:37.992]  Did a great job in Afghanistan.
[02:44:38.252 --> 02:44:40.153]  Love the slaughter you created in Iraq.
[02:44:41.650 --> 02:44:43.571]  Washington would have loved you!
[02:44:43.812 --> 02:44:45.893]  He would have flushed you down the toilet!
[02:44:46.934 --> 02:44:48.315]  Oh, they didn't have toilets back then.
[02:44:48.355 --> 02:44:49.396]  Down the outhouse!
[02:44:51.917 --> 02:44:52.177]  Yeah.
[02:44:52.958 --> 02:45:06.888]  I, uh, Washington, makes extended reference to the damages, the dangers, excuse me, of foreign nations who will seek to influence the American people and government.
[02:45:08.369 --> 02:45:19.821]   Nations who may be considered friendly, As well as nations considered enemies will equally try to influence the government to do their will.
[02:45:22.222 --> 02:45:34.149]  Real patriots, he warns, who resist the intrigues of foreign nations may find themselves suspected and odious in the eyes of others.
[02:45:35.089 --> 02:45:42.161]   Yet he urges the people to stand firm against such influences All the same.
[02:45:44.042 --> 02:45:47.584]  We must stand firm on peace.
[02:45:48.565 --> 02:45:52.027]  Not a peep from the politicians.
[02:45:52.527 --> 02:45:56.450]  Not a peep from the prostitutes about peace.
[02:45:57.090 --> 02:46:00.693]  And then we'll get back, we'll talk about the facts of Ukraine.
[02:46:01.753 --> 02:46:03.675]  And Alex Jones has been covering it.
[02:46:04.595 --> 02:46:10.119]  And then a woman called up earlier, what's going to be the implications if we go to war with Ukraine?
[02:46:10.765 --> 02:46:12.546]  Yeah, when we get back, we'll talk about that.
[02:46:13.127 --> 02:46:19.172]  But in the meantime, go to InfoWarsStores.com and put your money where your mind and heart is.
[02:46:19.912 --> 02:46:22.514]  Because united we stand, divided we fall.
[02:46:23.335 --> 02:46:25.176]  Hey, great being on InfoWars.
[02:46:25.797 --> 02:46:28.659]  And remember everyone, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:31.441]  They're stealing the truth from us.
[02:46:31.501 --> 02:46:37.246]  We're not allowed to speak out in anything that we want to say if we don't believe what the government tells you.
[02:46:38.234 --> 02:46:58.124]  And they had this article in Yahoo talking about that, this guy, legendary investor, Charles Munger, speaking at YouTube Finance, editor-in-chief, Andy Sewer, yeah, Sewer, Sewer, whatever, in an executive exclusive interview, spoke bluntly about vaccine hesitancy.
[02:46:58.884 --> 02:47:01.285]  This is his quote, part of it.
[02:47:02.306 --> 02:47:09.439]   If I were running the world, Munger said, if you were running the world, What kind of psychopath are you?
[02:47:09.839 --> 02:47:12.680]  Who the hell are you to even say something like that?
[02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:16.221]  If I was running the world, hey Selenti, don't you know?
[02:47:16.581 --> 02:47:17.981]  I'm a legendary financer.
[02:47:18.101 --> 02:47:19.361]  I know how to make a lot of money.
[02:47:20.021 --> 02:47:20.522]  Big deal.
[02:47:20.562 --> 02:47:21.122]  That's great.
[02:47:21.982 --> 02:47:23.702]  I know how to write a great magazine, man.
[02:47:23.942 --> 02:47:25.723]  And I'll out-fact you on the facts.
[02:47:26.183 --> 02:47:27.963]  Anytime, any day, any place.
[02:47:29.103 --> 02:47:30.684]  So, but, going on.
[02:47:32.704 --> 02:47:37.405]  If I were running the world, the vaccine mandate, he goes, of course it would be mandatory.
[02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:43.203]  When I was in World War II's army, they didn't ask me if I wanted a vaccination.
[02:47:44.104 --> 02:47:45.265]  They just vaccinated me.
[02:47:46.526 --> 02:47:50.108]  It didn't hurt me or anybody else in the world.
[02:47:52.010 --> 02:47:58.014]  We all just submitted to whatever the government told us to submit to.
[02:47:59.585 --> 02:48:05.708]  We all just submitted to whatever the government told us to submit to?
[02:48:06.188 --> 02:48:08.189]  What am I, six years old?
[02:48:09.129 --> 02:48:10.970]  You're still in high school!
[02:48:11.830 --> 02:48:14.751]  Oh, you're 98 and you haven't graduated yet?
[02:48:15.392 --> 02:48:17.552]  Submit to what the government?
[02:48:17.993 --> 02:48:20.294]  Boy, you're part of the New World Order.
[02:48:20.794 --> 02:48:22.194]  What government are you talking about?
[02:48:22.234 --> 02:48:23.575]  What's the government?
[02:48:23.955 --> 02:48:25.756]  What government are you talking about?
[02:48:27.997 --> 02:48:28.477]  Government?
[02:48:29.517 --> 02:48:31.058]  A bunch of dictators?
[02:48:32.500 --> 02:48:35.943]  A bunch of liars, cowards, freaks, and fools?
[02:48:37.524 --> 02:48:38.205]  Submit!
[02:48:39.065 --> 02:48:45.571]  Get this in your head, Munga, and every other dictator out there!
[02:48:46.452 --> 02:48:48.934]  I was not put on this earth to take orders.
[02:48:51.376 --> 02:48:56.921]  I obey the laws of nature and the divine spirits.
[02:48:57.748 --> 02:49:00.329]  Not low-life politics.
[02:49:01.049 --> 02:49:01.929]  Politics.
[02:49:02.429 --> 02:49:05.370]  Many tics that suck the life out of us.
[02:49:05.750 --> 02:49:07.450]  Little boys and girls.
[02:49:07.890 --> 02:49:09.250]  Arrogant little creeps.
[02:49:11.771 --> 02:49:15.132]  Who never work a day in their life and suck off the public tit.
[02:49:15.452 --> 02:49:16.512]  Like Biden!
[02:49:17.072 --> 02:49:21.533]  Been sucking off the public tit since he's 30 years old.
[02:49:22.113 --> 02:49:22.573]  Yeah.
[02:49:24.034 --> 02:49:24.574]  Submit.
[02:49:25.794 --> 02:49:26.054]  Again.
[02:49:29.091 --> 02:49:39.520]  It's total control and that's why you need to support InfoWars because they're going to keep robbing it from us over and over again.
[02:49:39.540 --> 02:50:04.468]   In Washington's, Washington's, uh, Washington's Day, Washington argued that long-standing poor relations will only lead to unnecessary wars due to this tendency to blow Minor offenses out of proportion when committed by nations viewed as enemies of the United States.
[02:50:05.449 --> 02:50:08.453]  Yeah, he only nailed that, you know.
[02:50:10.379 --> 02:50:16.866]  Back when he was President, the first President of the United States, and it's right in front of everybody's eyes right now.
[02:50:17.186 --> 02:50:22.632]  Oh, and talking about the low-life, pieces-of-scum, crap politicians that all want to go to war.
[02:50:22.652 --> 02:50:24.554]  Hey, little Lindsey Graham!
[02:50:24.954 --> 02:50:27.557]  Come out of the closet, pick up the gun, and go to war!
[02:50:27.858 --> 02:50:29.399]  No, little Mitch McConnell!
[02:50:29.700 --> 02:50:30.881]  Oh, you're a real fighter!
[02:50:31.181 --> 02:50:31.941]  Go to war!
[02:50:32.262 --> 02:50:33.262]  No, no, no!
[02:50:33.622 --> 02:50:35.003]  Little Chuckie Schumer!
[02:50:35.243 --> 02:50:36.584]  Little Chuckie Schumer!
[02:50:37.124 --> 02:50:40.326]  Oh, and Nancy Pelosi and Diana Sofeinstein!
[02:50:40.786 --> 02:50:42.047]  Everybody's equal!
[02:50:42.387 --> 02:50:44.708]  Get out there and pick up those guns!
[02:50:45.109 --> 02:50:47.290]  Go fight the Russians!
[02:50:49.771 --> 02:50:51.152]  No we won't, Salenti!
[02:50:51.472 --> 02:50:54.934]  We'll get you killed for shooting your mouth off!
[02:50:56.525 --> 02:51:01.006]  And we'll send out little boys and girls who believe the crap we spew out.
[02:51:03.686 --> 02:51:04.047]  Yeah.
[02:51:04.407 --> 02:51:04.787]  Look at him!
[02:51:06.247 --> 02:51:07.687]  Show me a fighter there!
[02:51:08.928 --> 02:51:09.728]  Not one!
[02:51:10.608 --> 02:51:11.408]  Not men!
[02:51:12.608 --> 02:51:14.529]  Arrogant little boys!
[02:51:15.469 --> 02:51:20.710]  Boy, I've been watching this thing in Canada with the emergency act that they passed.
[02:51:21.390 --> 02:51:22.770]  And, you know, they're debating it now.
[02:51:23.110 --> 02:51:28.790]   And I'm watching the guy or woman up there that's dressed up in his This costume drag!
[02:51:29.151 --> 02:51:31.037]  Honorable, this is not honorable!
[02:51:31.398 --> 02:51:33.123]  What are you, still in high school?
[02:51:34.079 --> 02:51:35.420]  Stop this crap!
[02:51:35.820 --> 02:51:36.521]  Honourable!
[02:51:36.801 --> 02:51:38.262]  Go screw yourself!
[02:51:38.542 --> 02:51:40.483]  You're more honourable than me!
[02:51:40.503 --> 02:51:42.165]  Hey, Solenti!
[02:51:42.185 --> 02:51:43.966]  We got elected!
[02:51:44.366 --> 02:51:48.389]  We were smart enough to BS a load of people!
[02:51:48.669 --> 02:51:50.230]  We're honourable!
[02:51:50.850 --> 02:51:51.951]  Oh, the Premier!
[02:51:52.391 --> 02:51:53.532]  Those are curse words!
[02:51:53.852 --> 02:51:55.373]  Tell them to somebody, go screw yourself!
[02:51:55.393 --> 02:51:58.656]  I don't know if you're effing crap, when they try to screw with your life!
[02:51:59.016 --> 02:52:00.217]  That's not profanity.
[02:52:00.737 --> 02:52:02.258]  That is proper language.
[02:52:02.748 --> 02:52:04.149]  In that kind of situation.
[02:52:05.130 --> 02:52:07.452]  We got a freak show in front of us.
[02:52:07.852 --> 02:52:09.414]  Look at a little true dope.
[02:52:09.754 --> 02:52:10.655]  Little true dope.
[02:52:10.735 --> 02:52:13.197]  A daddy's boy at that or maybe a daddy's girl.
[02:52:13.477 --> 02:52:16.099]  Not so sure because, hey, you got to be on both sides.
[02:52:16.380 --> 02:52:17.140]  Black and white.
[02:52:17.340 --> 02:52:19.202]  Yeah, you remember how he blackened his face up?
[02:52:20.523 --> 02:52:21.404]  A daddy's boy.
[02:52:21.484 --> 02:52:24.406]  A little nobody of a daddy's boy telling us what to do.
[02:52:24.767 --> 02:52:26.248]  Going back to George Washington.
[02:52:28.044 --> 02:52:40.267]  He continues his argument by claiming that alliances are likely to draw the United States into wars that have no justification and no benefit to the country beyond simply defending the favored nations.
[02:52:41.527 --> 02:53:03.793]   Alliances, he warns, which lead to poor relations with nations who feel they are not being treated as well as American allies, And threatened to influence the American government into making decisions based upon the will of their allies instead of the will of the American people.
[02:53:05.173 --> 02:53:05.753]  NATO?
[02:53:07.514 --> 02:53:08.114]  NATO?
[02:53:08.134 --> 02:53:10.714]  NATO's more important than America?
[02:53:10.734 --> 02:53:11.515]  What NATO?
[02:53:11.694 --> 02:53:18.574]  Why do we have 800 bases or 700 bases in 80 or 70 countries?
[02:53:18.574 --> 02:53:19.654]  Bring home the troops.
[02:53:19.699 --> 02:53:20.839]  Secure the homeland!
[02:53:21.840 --> 02:53:27.903]  I'm driving out yesterday, a rotted, stinking infrastructure, hitting bumps everywhere I drive!
[02:53:27.923 --> 02:53:31.185]  It's a third world infrastructure!
[02:53:31.205 --> 02:53:34.426]  Taking a subway in New York is a night in Calcutta!
[02:53:35.707 --> 02:53:37.128]  This is a time for peace!
[02:53:37.448 --> 02:53:39.829]  It's a time to celebrate Washington!
[02:53:41.190 --> 02:53:43.011]  Not what Washington has become!
[02:53:43.411 --> 02:53:46.273]  A bunch of arrogant little boys and girls!
[02:53:49.534 --> 02:53:59.578]  Washington goes on to urge American people to take advantage of their isolated position in the world and avoid attachments and entanglements in foreign affairs.
[02:53:59.598 --> 02:54:00.678]  You ready?
[02:54:01.078 --> 02:54:10.401]  Especially those of Europe, which he argues have little or nothing to do with the interests of America.
[02:54:10.421 --> 02:54:11.822]  Hey!
[02:54:12.304 --> 02:54:14.786]  Hey, all you fat-mouthed politicians!
[02:54:15.406 --> 02:54:17.348]  All you tough guys and girls!
[02:54:17.828 --> 02:54:21.271]  Hey, look at the crime rates scoring all over America!
[02:54:21.711 --> 02:54:24.093]  Oh, and you're gonna win a war overseas!
[02:54:24.393 --> 02:54:27.656]  You losers haven't won a war since World War II!
[02:54:28.016 --> 02:54:28.876]  Oh, Salenti!
[02:54:29.357 --> 02:54:31.679]  We only killed 3 million in Vietnam!
[02:54:31.999 --> 02:54:34.301]  We only poisoned a place with Agent Orange!
[02:54:34.581 --> 02:54:37.943]  If they allowed us to kill another 10 million, we would've won!
[02:54:38.203 --> 02:54:39.725]  And we only killed a million in Iraq!
[02:54:40.777 --> 02:54:47.702]  Great job in Operation Enduring Freedom, brought to you by George W. Bush, the Afghan War, the longest war.
[02:54:48.503 --> 02:54:50.945]  Listen to what Washington said.
[02:54:52.025 --> 02:54:53.747]  This is Washington's day.
[02:54:53.767 --> 02:55:03.514]  This is a time for a revolution of freedom, peace and justice, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:55:05.095 --> 02:55:07.317]  That's our Declaration of Independence.
[02:55:07.970 --> 02:55:11.452]  That these low-life garbage scum have stolen from us.
[02:55:11.773 --> 02:55:12.833]  Happiness, Salenti?
[02:55:13.214 --> 02:55:15.215]  Why dare, how dare you be happy?
[02:55:15.595 --> 02:55:16.736]  Get back in your house!
[02:55:17.176 --> 02:55:18.157]  Shelter in place!
[02:55:18.637 --> 02:55:20.779]  I'm little Andy Cuomo, I'll tell you what to do!
[02:55:21.059 --> 02:55:23.160]  No, I'm Gavin Newsom, born on 3rd base!
[02:55:23.381 --> 02:55:25.682]  Another arrogant boy, I'll tell you what to do!
[02:55:26.142 --> 02:55:28.384]  I'm cutthroat McCrone, I'll tell you what to do!
[02:55:28.404 --> 02:55:31.826]  In a country near you, a freak is running it.
[02:55:32.347 --> 02:55:33.688]  Freedom has been robbed from us.
[02:55:34.768 --> 02:55:36.950]  We'll be back in a few, and remember what I said.
[02:55:37.731 --> 02:55:40.172]  Support peace, freedom, and liberty.
[02:55:40.352 --> 02:55:41.213]  Support InfoWars.

[02:58:05.294 --> 02:58:19.383]   Speaking of war, Smedley Butler, in his book, The War's a Racket, This is one of the most decorated Marine at the time in the United States.
[02:58:21.984 --> 02:58:30.367]  And in his book, Wars of Racket, I spent 33 years, he said, in four months in active military service.
[02:58:31.227 --> 02:58:36.089]  And during that period, I spent most of my time as a high-class muscle man for big business.
[02:58:36.689 --> 02:58:37.409]  Sound familiar?
[02:58:37.429 --> 02:58:40.030]  It's called a military-industrial complex.
[02:58:41.457 --> 02:58:42.358]  For Wall Street?
[02:58:42.418 --> 02:58:43.338]  Yeah, no kidding.
[02:58:43.658 --> 02:58:47.181]  Oh, you mean the legendary investor Charlie Munger?
[02:58:50.763 --> 02:58:51.564]  For the bankers?
[02:58:51.944 --> 02:58:53.005]  Yeah, the banksters?
[02:58:54.065 --> 02:58:59.409]  Like the Goldman Chase and the JP Morgans and the Little Jamie Diamonds?
[02:59:00.249 --> 02:59:07.414]  Oh, they are the banksters that, after Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace drove them out of the temple?
[02:59:09.095 --> 02:59:10.676]  Three days later, he's on the cross.
[02:59:10.716 --> 02:59:11.476]  Those bankers?
[02:59:14.596 --> 02:59:17.837]  In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.
[02:59:19.878 --> 02:59:20.458]  Corporatism.
[02:59:21.638 --> 02:59:27.159]  I helped make Mexico, and especially Tampico, safe for American oil interests in 1914.
[02:59:27.980 --> 02:59:34.481]  I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in.
[02:59:36.222 --> 02:59:42.367]   I helped in the raping Of a half dozen Central American republics that have benefited Wall Street.
[02:59:43.788 --> 02:59:51.594]  I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902 and 1912.
[02:59:54.117 --> 03:00:00.122]  I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916.
[03:00:01.743 --> 03:00:06.287]  I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies.
[03:00:07.299 --> 03:00:08.479]  In 1903.
[03:00:09.159 --> 03:00:18.781]  In China in 1927, I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested.
[03:00:19.362 --> 03:00:23.662]  Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints.
[03:00:24.963 --> 03:00:28.903]  The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts.
[03:00:29.804 --> 03:00:31.584]  I operated in three continents.
[03:00:34.405 --> 03:00:39.150]   For a great many years as a soldier, I had a suspicion that war was a racket.
[03:00:39.911 --> 03:00:43.673]  Not until I retired to civil life did I fully realize it.
[03:00:44.473 --> 03:00:53.058]  Now that I see the international war clouds gathering as they are today, I must face it and speak out.
[03:00:53.578 --> 03:00:57.160]  And he writes this a few years before World War II.
[03:00:57.961 --> 03:00:58.321]  Got it?
[03:00:59.862 --> 03:01:09.113]   Earlier, one of the callers asked Alex, you know, we'll You know, after what they've done with us with this COVID thing.
[03:01:09.293 --> 03:01:11.475]  They're not going to get away with it.
[03:01:12.015 --> 03:01:12.695]  Yes, they will.
[03:01:14.297 --> 03:01:17.339]  You go back to a couple of issues back of our Trends Journal.
[03:01:19.180 --> 03:01:21.482]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:01:22.543 --> 03:01:24.344]  Oh, people will forget about the COVID war.
[03:01:25.605 --> 03:01:26.926]  Now we got a big war to fight.
[03:01:28.827 --> 03:01:29.848]  And will it affect us?
[03:01:29.888 --> 03:01:37.813]   Well, you know, if it becomes World War III, it'll be the war that they asked Einstein, what kind of weapons will be fought in World War 3?
[03:01:37.853 --> 03:01:38.674]  He said, I don't know.
[03:01:38.734 --> 03:01:41.757]  He said, but they'll be using sticks and stones to fight the 4th.
[03:01:45.120 --> 03:01:47.142]  But you have to watch your oil prices.
[03:01:47.223 --> 03:01:51.287]  And as Alex said before, oil prices were going up before this Ukraine thing happened.
[03:01:53.950 --> 03:02:02.195]   And again, never talking about peace, All they do is, this is how they're going to threaten Russia if Russia does this or that.
[03:02:02.515 --> 03:02:04.075]  Oh, how about that little boy, Sullivan?
[03:02:04.315 --> 03:02:06.356]  Again, a little boy, a little boy, what is it?
[03:02:06.636 --> 03:02:13.478]  He's a blabbermouth for one of the agencies, for the administration, I forget which one.
[03:02:15.539 --> 03:02:18.060]  Go back to your Trends Journal last week.
[03:02:19.420 --> 03:02:28.531]   He said, evidence, good evidence, that's very highly likely that the Russians are going to attack Before the end of the Olympics.
[03:02:29.372 --> 03:02:29.772]  That's right.
[03:02:30.493 --> 03:02:31.714]  Oh, the Olympics are over, aren't they?
[03:02:33.435 --> 03:02:36.358]  And again, people have no idea the history about Ukraine.
[03:02:37.659 --> 03:02:41.782]  It was only part of Russia for, you know, 200 years.
[03:02:43.864 --> 03:02:52.551]  And the story, you know, the story when Gorbachev came in, he put it back in, made it, and Crimea was always been part of Russia, you know, since the 1700s.
[03:02:52.370 --> 03:03:02.370]  1700s. And they had a vote, by the way, in Crimea.
[03:03:00.968 --> 03:03:03.729]  Russia didn't annex it.
[03:03:03.789 --> 03:03:09.632]  The vote was shown to be perfectly legal by international observers.
[03:03:09.852 --> 03:03:12.533]  Over 80% of the Crimeans came out and voted.
[03:03:12.853 --> 03:03:20.616]  They didn't want to become under the new dictatorship that the America put into Ukraine when they overthrew the government back in 2014.
[03:03:22.197 --> 03:03:30.352]   Over 95% of the Crimeans said, no, we're not going to join with Ukraine.
[03:03:31.373 --> 03:03:33.355]  We're staying on the Russian end.
[03:03:37.057 --> 03:03:43.462]  This is a quote from, let me find it here, what did I do with it?
[03:03:43.562 --> 03:03:44.763]  From Victoria Nuland.
[03:03:46.084 --> 03:03:52.309]  Victoria Nuland was the Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs.
[03:03:54.611 --> 03:04:02.003]   If you Google up Victoria Nuland December December.
[03:04:02.663 --> 03:04:09.125]  Victoria Nuland, December 2013, Washington DC, Ukraine.
[03:04:10.166 --> 03:04:11.266]  She's given a talk.
[03:04:12.667 --> 03:04:20.729]  The talk is brought to you by 1N, Big Sign, Chevron, another one, Exxon Mobil.
[03:04:25.151 --> 03:04:29.692]  Again, we wrote about it in detail in your Trends Journal.
[03:04:31.633 --> 03:04:43.635]  Back in September, excuse me, in the spring of 2014, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts did a huge article in here about the overthrow of the Ukraine government.
[03:04:45.696 --> 03:04:54.177]  He goes on to say, Assistant Secretary of State Nuland boasted that Washington had invested $5 billion in non-governmental organizations.
[03:04:54.677 --> 03:04:57.078]  This is at the talk show I was just talking about in Ukraine.
[03:04:58.092 --> 03:05:05.298]  The purpose of the NGOs is, quote, to teach democracy to Ukraine.
[03:05:05.498 --> 03:05:08.020]  And he goes on to say, however, Ukraine had a democracy.
[03:05:08.400 --> 03:05:11.662]  Yanukovych was the president and they overthrew it.
[03:05:12.343 --> 03:05:17.407]  This is from your Trends Journal in September, excuse me, February 2015.
[03:05:18.107 --> 03:05:34.012]   In early February 2014, in a recording was leaked, the Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland said to the ambassador that they were going to replace Ukrainian Viktor Yanukovych with YATS.
[03:05:34.773 --> 03:05:35.253]  And they did.
[03:05:36.253 --> 03:05:37.634]  Can't go in, we're running out of time.
[03:05:37.654 --> 03:05:39.595]  It's all in your Trends Journal.
[03:05:39.635 --> 03:05:40.816]  History before it happens.
[03:05:40.836 --> 03:05:42.076]  There's no magazine like it.
[03:05:43.297 --> 03:05:49.900]  And she told the FU to go, she said to FU to the EU, and they were going to do what they wanted.
[03:05:51.141 --> 03:05:52.501]  This is not America.
[03:05:52.962 --> 03:05:55.163]  Not what Washington would have liked, or I like, or you like.
[03:05:55.681 --> 03:05:56.681]  See you next week.
[03:05:57.681 --> 03:06:00.440]  (dramatic music)
[03:06:00.440 --> 03:06:12.681]   You are insane if you are not supplementing vitamin D3 and vitamin K in your life.
[03:06:12.681 --> 03:06:14.281]  That's not my opinion.
[03:06:14.281 --> 03:06:21.121]   If you look at the facts, you are crazy if you're not taking it at least several times a week,
[03:06:21.121 --> 03:06:26.241]   especially if you've got darker skin and aren't getting a bunch of sun.
[03:06:26.241 --> 03:06:30.481]   Just look into vitamin D3 and folks that have more melanin in their skin
[03:06:30.481 --> 03:06:34.781]   and the fact that that blocks the sun and then your body can't produce it naturally.
[03:06:34.781 --> 03:06:37.281]  The best place to get it is naturally from the sun.
[03:06:37.281 --> 03:06:43.040]   The second best place is by ingesting it and the best way to do that is under the tongue.
[03:06:43.270 --> 03:06:43.670]  I feel it.
[03:06:43.690 --> 03:06:44.050]  I notice it.
[03:06:43.869 --> 03:06:46.949]  vessels so it goes directly in the blood.
[03:06:46.949 --> 03:06:50.469]   And that's how you take when her son is sublingually under the tongue.
[03:06:50.469 --> 03:06:56.989]  Now this is a high-end, organic, bioavailable vitamin D3.
[03:06:56.989 --> 03:07:01.869]   And then on top of it, it has a high-quality vitamin K because the two work in synergy,
[03:07:01.869 --> 03:07:06.849]   not just for your immune system, but every major function in the body.
[03:07:06.849 --> 03:07:09.588]   And when I forget sometimes to take it for a week, I feel it.
[03:07:09.588 --> 03:07:10.588]  I notice it.
[03:07:10.588 --> 03:07:15.748]   I religiously now henpeck my dad and call him every couple days and make sure he's taking
[03:07:16.242 --> 03:07:19.243]  I go over to his house every couple weeks and check that the bottles are going down.
[03:07:19.663 --> 03:07:24.264]  And since he's been doing it for six months, it has been miraculous he looks ten years younger.
[03:07:24.884 --> 03:07:30.045]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am religiously now taking it every morning a couple drops out of the tongue.
[03:07:30.405 --> 03:07:31.345]  It's great for children.
[03:07:31.445 --> 03:07:32.366]  It's great for adults.
[03:07:32.466 --> 03:07:37.507]  It is extremely critical for older people and again, folks with brown skin.
[03:07:38.087 --> 03:07:51.798]  If you've got brown skin or you've got dark brown skin, you better listen to me and research this, because the system isn't telling you why black folks out there are dropping dead in such massive numbers, but we are here talking about it.
[03:07:52.118 --> 03:07:55.221]  The number one issue is vitamin D3.
[03:07:55.341 --> 03:07:56.902]  You must have it to live.
[03:07:57.181 --> 03:08:01.421]   Wherever you get it, get your vitamin D. We have a high quality source, back in stock,
[03:08:01.421 --> 03:08:15.341]  50% off, winter sun, Infowarsstore.com.
[03:08:15.341 --> 03:08:19.661]  You're looking at Infowars' newest designer t-shirt.
[03:08:20.495 --> 03:08:22.597]  It's the presidential emoji shirt.
[03:08:23.438 --> 03:08:31.046]  And it's got all 46 presidents going back to the founding of this nation with George Washington.
[03:08:31.606 --> 03:08:35.050]  And it ends up with Obama, Trump, and Biden.
[03:08:35.550 --> 03:08:36.992]  And of course, Biden is a clown.
[03:08:37.472 --> 03:08:39.194]  Trump's wearing the sunglasses and we know.
[03:08:40.035 --> 03:08:43.398]  That Barack Obama is not a good friend of America.
[03:08:43.879 --> 03:08:49.905]  This shirt is very thought-provoking, it'll cause a lot of conversations, and it's a great way to wake people up.
[03:08:49.965 --> 03:08:51.647]  It also makes a great gift.
[03:08:51.667 --> 03:08:55.732]  You're not just giving someone the gift of a fun t-shirt when you give them this.
[03:08:57.039 --> 03:09:08.252]  You're also funding the Information War, and there are dozens and dozens and dozens of new t-shirts that we've designed in the last six months that are now available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:09:08.592 --> 03:09:14.779]  And when you purchase the shirt, you're giving yourself the gift of waking up the world and living in a free society.
[03:09:15.120 --> 03:09:18.103]  So get one for yourself and give one as a gift.
[03:09:18.503 --> 03:09:31.186]  All of it is a 360 win and it keeps us on the air while the Democrats and the Deep State and the Davos Group and Klaus Schwab and the Globalists are fighting around the clock to shut us down because they can't succeed if we stay on the air.
[03:09:31.886 --> 03:09:37.668]  And of course we have a whole line of amazing 1776 shirts in short sleeve and long sleeve.
[03:09:37.968 --> 03:09:39.788]  And then of course there's one of my favorites.
[03:09:40.308 --> 03:09:43.269]  The Vaccine Passport T-shirt.
[03:09:43.689 --> 03:09:47.449]   This lets the globalists know you're not signing on to their mark of the beast, and you're
[03:09:47.449 --> 03:09:51.948]   fully aware of what they're doing, and you're educating other sheeple at the same time while
[03:09:51.948 --> 03:09:53.328]  funding the InfoWar.
[03:09:53.328 --> 03:09:54.968]  A true 360 win.
[03:09:54.968 --> 03:10:00.289]   Get yours now with hundreds of other amazing t-shirts to choose from at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:10:00.289 --> 03:10:05.048]   All of this art is original and it's incredibly thought-provoking like this one.
[03:10:05.048 --> 03:10:08.969]   You've got one mouse asking the other mouse, "Are you gonna take the vaccine?"
[03:10:09.436 --> 03:10:10.277]  He says, no way.
[03:10:10.697 --> 03:10:13.138]  They haven't even finished the human trials yet.
[03:10:13.898 --> 03:10:17.179]  These are the type of shirts you'll find exclusively at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:10:17.499 --> 03:10:20.140]  Again, hundreds and hundreds of shirts to choose from.
[03:10:20.560 --> 03:10:24.121]  Dozens and dozens of new shirts that we just produced in the last few months.
[03:10:24.181 --> 03:10:26.282]  And it funds the InfoWar, and it spreads the word.
[03:10:26.362 --> 03:10:29.523]  Like this one, which is mainly for Texans, but other folks might want one.
[03:10:30.123 --> 03:10:32.284]  Most likely to secede.
[03:10:33.044 --> 03:10:39.947]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com, and it keeps us on air, and it exercises free speech in the public, something the left doesn't want.
[03:10:40.347 --> 03:10:44.509]  So again, thanks for keeping us on the air, and thanks for shopping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:10:44.749 --> 03:11:00.036]  I want to salute and thank you all for your support, and I want to encourage you to go and get these t-shirts and other pieces of apparel and wear them openly, loudly, and proudly, and let the leftists know they're never going to silence us, they're never going to break our will, and we are going to take America and the world back.
