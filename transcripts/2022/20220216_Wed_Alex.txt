[00:00.000 --> 00:28.860]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[00:28.860 --> 00:32.580]  How much heat have you gotten for being friends with him and having him on the show?
[00:32.580 --> 00:34.260]  A lot, but I don't pay attention.
[00:34.260 --> 00:36.060]  Okay, yeah.
[00:36.060 --> 00:38.540]  I just, I can justify it.
[00:38.540 --> 00:42.300]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[00:42.300 --> 00:45.660]  He's a wild entertainer and a brilliant man.
[00:45.660 --> 00:46.660]  Isn't he fantastic?
[00:46.660 --> 00:47.660]  And no one is perfect.
[00:47.660 --> 00:49.980]  I've known Alex for like more than 20 years.
[00:49.980 --> 00:50.980]  I've hung out with that guy.
[00:50.980 --> 00:55.180]  We've been hammered together so many times, it's like, that is the most misunderstood
[00:55.180 --> 00:56.180]  guy on the planet.
[00:56.180 --> 00:59.540]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:59.540 --> 01:01.780]  Shout out to Alex Jones, we love you.
[01:01.780 --> 01:04.180]  Alex Jones is a journalist and member of the media.
[01:04.180 --> 01:05.180]  End of story.
[01:05.180 --> 01:09.300]  Recently, many of the biggest tech companies joined in a coordinated effort to censor content
[01:09.300 --> 01:10.660]  from broadcaster Alex Jones.
[01:10.660 --> 01:16.020]  There's a reason why the mainstream media calls a guy like him a bomb thrower or conspiracy
[01:16.020 --> 01:21.260]  theorist because they're in fear of the truth that he does actually bring out.
[01:21.260 --> 01:26.300]  Why are the most powerful companies in the world suddenly so threatened by an independent
[01:26.300 --> 01:31.300]  radio show host in Texas that they're willing to lose business in order to make him shut
[01:31.300 --> 01:32.300]  up?
[01:32.300 --> 01:33.300]  He runs a media organization.
[01:33.300 --> 01:38.860]  And so when the January 6th committee subpoenas him, they're basically violating our first
[01:38.860 --> 01:39.860]  amendment protections.
[01:39.860 --> 01:43.980]  The Department of Justice says not only is it investigating what happened inside the
[01:43.980 --> 01:50.100]  Capitol, but the conspirators and instigators who may have started this whole thing.
[01:50.100 --> 01:54.100]  Now the committees decide to shut down one of the most popular journalists on the right,
[01:54.100 --> 01:55.100]  Alex Jones.
[01:55.100 --> 01:56.100]  Yes, journalists.
[01:56.100 --> 02:00.700]  The House Committee investigating the deadly assault on the US Capitol is subpoenaing Trump
[02:00.700 --> 02:04.140]  allies Roger Stone and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:04.140 --> 02:07.820]  The committee says he helped organize the rally ahead of the riots.
[02:07.820 --> 02:12.780]  Alex Jones isn't simply innocent of inciting crime on January 6th.
[02:12.780 --> 02:18.140]  Alex Jones actively worked to prevent crimes from taking place on January 6th.
[02:18.140 --> 02:37.420]  We're not running interference for Alex Jones and we're not guessing about it.
[02:37.420 --> 02:47.300]  We happen to know this for a fact.
[02:47.300 --> 02:53.460]  Alex Jones is a journalist the same as Brian Stelter and Jake Tapper and Don Lemonar.
[02:53.460 --> 02:54.460]  Absolutely.
[02:54.460 --> 03:05.660]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[03:05.660 --> 03:09.620]  And if Jones said that with Tony Fauci, he would ask him real questions, just as journalists
[03:09.620 --> 03:10.620]  are supposed to do.
[03:10.620 --> 03:12.580]  He wouldn't just slobber all over him.
[03:12.580 --> 03:14.620]  Epstein, he was way ahead with that.
[03:14.620 --> 03:17.140]  He told me about Epstein a f***ing decade ago.
[03:17.140 --> 03:19.980]  Alex detailed all of that.
[03:19.980 --> 03:22.260]  Alex Jones info wars.
[03:22.260 --> 03:27.180]  The media has tarnished him with all sorts of name calling, conspiracy theorist, bomb
[03:27.180 --> 03:28.180]  thrower.
[03:28.180 --> 03:33.660]  The one thing that I know about this gentleman Alex Jones is that he loves this country.
[03:33.660 --> 03:36.260]  He is as smart as a whip.
[03:36.260 --> 03:40.700]  He absolutely believes in what he believes in.
[03:40.700 --> 03:43.260]  And he also does his research and his homework.
[03:43.260 --> 03:49.420]  Coolie compare Hotez's views on COVID to say Alex Jones's views on COVID and ask yourself
[03:49.420 --> 03:50.420]  who's saner.
[03:50.420 --> 03:51.420]  It's not even close.
[03:51.420 --> 03:55.020]  He's incredibly detailed in his research.
[03:55.020 --> 03:56.020]  He loves this country.
[03:56.020 --> 04:01.220]  He is a patriot and he's somebody who we better listen to or others in this country better
[04:01.220 --> 04:02.220]  listen to.
[04:02.220 --> 04:04.820]  Is it a stretch to say that Tucker Carlson is the new Alex Jones?
[04:04.820 --> 04:06.620]  They're no vaccine passports.
[04:06.620 --> 04:07.620]  That's insane.
[04:07.620 --> 04:08.620]  It's Alex Jones stuff.
[04:08.620 --> 04:13.140]  And by the way, just so you know, as proof if you want to get a job, you'll need your
[04:13.140 --> 04:16.140]  vaccine papers.
[04:16.140 --> 04:30.460]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's going
[04:30.460 --> 04:38.180]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[04:38.180 --> 04:41.060]  It's Alex Jones of the information war.
[04:41.060 --> 04:56.460]  It's Alex Jones, my friends, it's Wednesday, February 16, 2022, we're about to be here live
[04:56.460 --> 05:01.260]  for the next four hours.
[05:01.260 --> 05:05.860]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying
[05:05.860 --> 05:09.900]  and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[05:09.900 --> 05:14.380]  And when it comes to information, boy, is that true today.
[05:14.380 --> 05:21.420]  We see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation, great recent combine, trying
[05:21.420 --> 05:28.020]  to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing
[05:28.020 --> 05:34.580]  the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[05:34.580 --> 05:40.580]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030,
[05:40.580 --> 05:43.300]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[05:43.300 --> 05:48.460]  And none of it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[05:48.460 --> 05:50.540]  silenced and gas lit.
[05:50.540 --> 05:54.540]  That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence, and that's
[05:54.540 --> 05:58.940]  why it's hard to share info wars links and band up video links, that's why we've got
[05:58.940 --> 06:10.940]  to share them now more than ever.
[06:10.940 --> 06:17.660]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[06:17.660 --> 06:24.180]  the info war.
[06:24.180 --> 06:32.140]  There is a global corporate crime syndicate that has been meeting since 1954 that calls
[06:32.140 --> 06:35.140]  itself the Bilderberg group.
[06:35.140 --> 06:39.140]  And they represent the most powerful families and companies in the world.
[06:39.140 --> 06:44.420]  They are a group of transhumanist to believe in a post human world.
[06:44.420 --> 06:48.980]  And they have a public arm called the World Economic Forum or the Debo's group headed
[06:48.980 --> 06:59.500]  up by Klaus Schwab, who's also the ongoing rotating head of the Bilderberg group, once
[06:59.500 --> 07:06.940]  the founder of it, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, the prince or consort to the
[07:06.940 --> 07:10.860]  queen of the Netherlands.
[07:10.860 --> 07:18.500]  And of course, cousins with the late Prince Philip, another eugenicist of one noun, another
[07:18.500 --> 07:21.500]  depopulationist.
[07:21.500 --> 07:25.300]  So if you want to know who you're facing and who is orchestrating the martial law worldwide
[07:25.300 --> 07:30.780]  and the vaccine passports and the global social credit scores and the civil emergency in Canada
[07:30.780 --> 07:37.340]  and the financial dictatorship, it's these people.
[07:37.340 --> 07:39.340]  And they write books about it and give speeches about it.
[07:39.340 --> 07:42.540]  I've got clips of Klaus Schwab saying we're going to bring in an authoritarian world government,
[07:42.540 --> 07:43.540]  close quote.
[07:43.540 --> 07:47.700]  I've got Klaus Schwab on tape saying they're going to seize all the major national governments
[07:47.700 --> 07:52.660]  and already have half the world governments under their control, close quote.
[07:52.660 --> 07:57.500]  I have quotes of him saying you'll own nothing and have nothing and like it.
[07:57.500 --> 08:03.500]  I've got quotes of him saying we'll soon be in a post human world by 2040.
[08:03.500 --> 08:08.060]  I have clips of him saying by 2025 you'll have microchips under your skin to buy and
[08:08.060 --> 08:10.620]  sell on national French television.
[08:10.620 --> 08:14.260]  I got it all.
[08:14.260 --> 08:20.180]  You see, I was just paying attention with horror of what they were saying 20 years ago
[08:20.180 --> 08:24.860]  at their events but wasn't getting widely circulated.
[08:24.860 --> 08:28.460]  And I watched them build their attack plan and I watched them prepare for it and I warned
[08:28.460 --> 08:32.020]  you it was coming and I said they'd use a virus to bring in the first wave of control.
[08:32.020 --> 08:36.140]  Then cyber attacks and power outages and race war would be next.
[08:36.140 --> 08:41.980]  And I can tell you that in the Pentagon and the CIA, they are telling the managers prepare
[08:41.980 --> 08:47.660]  for massive food shortages and power outages that of course will be blamed on Russia.
[08:47.660 --> 08:50.900]  This country and the Western world is sinking.
[08:50.900 --> 08:53.220]  We're under attack by globalist.
[08:53.220 --> 08:55.220]  We're in our last days.
[08:55.220 --> 08:59.900]  So people ask how are you handling an Alex with all the attacks you're under?
[08:59.900 --> 09:02.940]  I'm on the deck of the ship trying to land the ship.
[09:02.940 --> 09:03.940]  All we're taking on water.
[09:03.940 --> 09:05.540]  I mean, how am I doing?
[09:05.540 --> 09:10.620]  I'm looking at my children on board with me and you're on board with me.
[09:10.620 --> 09:12.260]  I'm not playing to be the damn captain here.
[09:12.260 --> 09:17.540]  I'm just saying we better get together collectively and be the captain because the wheel is too
[09:17.540 --> 09:22.500]  big for me to turn by myself and I'm fighting with it with Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates right
[09:22.500 --> 09:23.500]  now.
[09:23.500 --> 09:24.500]  We're at the wheel.
[09:24.500 --> 09:30.220]  It's like a wrestling match, an arm wrestling match and I'm giving it everything I can.
[09:30.220 --> 09:33.220]  And yes, Klaus Schwab has been rightfully called by some of the major conservative leaders
[09:33.220 --> 09:36.260]  of Europe a neo-communist.
[09:36.260 --> 09:47.620]  That's why in his office he has a statue of Vi Lenin, Vladimir Lenin.
[09:47.620 --> 09:54.380]  So everything flows out of that.
[09:54.380 --> 09:59.500]  The tyranny we face flows out of that ultra rich that want communism for you, not for
[09:59.500 --> 10:00.500]  them.
[10:00.500 --> 10:01.500]  They get jumbo jets.
[10:01.500 --> 10:02.500]  They get super yachts.
[10:02.500 --> 10:07.180]  They live on 50,000 and 100,000 acre palatial estates while you're locked in a 200 square
[10:07.180 --> 10:10.740]  foot coffin apartment.
[10:10.740 --> 10:11.740]  That's their plan.
[10:11.740 --> 10:17.860]  So I can cover all this news all day long and I will.
[10:17.860 --> 10:21.420]  But if you don't understand that we're in the season of false flags and they've been
[10:21.420 --> 10:28.620]  pushing us and attacking us and going after populist and Christians worldwide hoping to
[10:28.620 --> 10:34.660]  elicit a violent response so they can declare worldwide martial law and turn off the lights
[10:34.660 --> 10:37.940]  and come after us.
[10:37.940 --> 10:43.860]  He that shoots first loses the upper hand.
[10:43.860 --> 10:48.060]  That's why we're in the season of staging false flags to attack Russia, staging false
[10:48.060 --> 10:53.940]  flags in Canada's capital Ottawa to bring in control, staging racial attacks here.
[10:53.940 --> 11:00.780]  Everything has been preset, everything has been prepared and right now we are politically,
[11:00.780 --> 11:05.180]  culturally, and spiritually turned back the tide.
[11:05.180 --> 11:09.500]  The global is like a fish grab the lure and we're running out to see with it a mile on
[11:09.500 --> 11:11.380]  that steel line.
[11:11.380 --> 11:16.660]  But now the fish is tired and we are reeling it back in and it's going to fight but it's
[11:16.660 --> 11:18.060]  lost the initiative.
[11:18.060 --> 11:19.060]  It's been identified.
[11:19.060 --> 11:20.340]  People know about the new world order.
[11:20.340 --> 11:21.340]  They know about the plan.
[11:21.340 --> 11:27.980]  The more people get it, then everything becomes clear by the day their destruction becomes
[11:27.980 --> 11:33.540]  more and more of a foregone conclusion.
[11:33.540 --> 11:38.340]  That said, though, that will make them accelerate the organized collapse of society into a disorganized
[11:38.340 --> 11:40.340]  one believing that's the only hope they've got.
[11:40.340 --> 11:49.700]  So we're in between a rock and a hard place and so are the social engineers.
[11:49.700 --> 11:53.380]  The world is waking up, though, people now understand including his own party and even
[11:53.380 --> 11:58.980]  classical liberals in Canada are understanding that Trudeau is setting up a dictatorship.
[11:58.980 --> 12:03.780]  They're pointing out that he lost the election and only won by 30% in an in parliament.
[12:03.780 --> 12:07.380]  They're able to manipulate that so that he's a dictator.
[12:07.380 --> 12:08.940]  It's all coming out.
[12:08.940 --> 12:10.780]  This Greg Rees reports on Band-Aught video.
[12:10.780 --> 12:11.780]  It needs to get out to everybody.
[12:11.780 --> 12:15.500]  You know if you want to stop these monsters, Trudeau's imminent false flag to crush the
[12:15.500 --> 12:16.500]  Canadian people.
[12:16.500 --> 12:27.180]  Here's the report, please share it, like your life depends on it.
[12:27.180 --> 12:30.700]  That's why individual rights and freedoms are so important, right?
[12:30.700 --> 12:37.540]  Because it's you as a person, you as an individual, not you as a family, not you as a group, okay?
[12:37.540 --> 12:42.100]  Not you as part of some other organization, not you as part of the province, it's you
[12:42.100 --> 12:49.860]  as an individual Canadian, possess these rights, that's what's important.
[12:49.860 --> 12:57.700]  After discussing with Cabinet and caucus, after consultation with premiers from all provinces
[12:57.700 --> 13:06.260]  and territories, after speaking with opposition leaders, the federal government has invoked
[13:06.260 --> 13:13.980]  the Emergencies Act to supplement provincial and territorial capacity to address the blockades
[13:13.980 --> 13:15.420]  and occupations.
[13:15.420 --> 13:22.380]  Justin Trudeau has enacted the Emergency Powers Act against all who protest his dictates,
[13:22.380 --> 13:25.180]  including seizing people's bank accounts.
[13:25.180 --> 13:31.340]  Trudeau won't allow these Canadian citizens to have a life in their own country, nor will
[13:31.340 --> 13:33.380]  he allow them to leave.
[13:33.380 --> 13:39.220]  These are Canadian families celebrating together peacefully as they honorably protest their
[13:39.220 --> 13:40.220]  government.
[13:40.220 --> 13:45.060]  It is now evident that Trudeau is capable of anything.
[13:45.060 --> 13:50.980]  Last Sunday at around 3 a.m., more than 2,000 firearms were stolen from a shipping lot in
[13:50.980 --> 13:53.060]  Peterborough, Ontario.
[13:53.060 --> 13:58.460]  A former sniper for the RCMP has announced that multiple sources have warned that Trudeau's
[13:58.460 --> 14:03.860]  government could be planting weapons in Ottawa to deceptively frame the Freedom Convoy as
[14:03.860 --> 14:12.300]  violent and use it as a false pretext for violently ending the historic peaceful protest.
[14:12.300 --> 14:16.540]  While the truckers keep saying that their movement is a movement of the people and is
[14:16.540 --> 14:22.540]  non-political, certain suspicious individuals have stepped into leadership roles.
[14:22.540 --> 14:29.940]  B.J. Dichter, a politician and co-founder of L.G.B. Tory and Tamara Leach of Wexit, who
[14:29.940 --> 14:35.260]  is funded by a sitting member of the Globalists' Atlantic Council, are the ones who set up
[14:35.260 --> 14:39.340]  and manage the GoFundMe page for the Freedom Convoy.
[14:39.340 --> 14:45.300]  And former Liberal staffer for the Minister of Public Safety, Dagny Pawlik, has recently
[14:45.300 --> 14:48.900]  been made part of the communications team.
[14:48.900 --> 14:52.620]  The people involved claim it's all a deceptive story.
[14:52.620 --> 14:55.980]  Most people don't seem to know where these people came from, how they got involved, how
[14:55.980 --> 14:59.740]  they ended up controlling all of the money, why they're doing all of the speaking.
[14:59.740 --> 15:01.060]  These people aren't even truckers.
[15:01.060 --> 15:03.500]  B.J. Dichter is not a trucker.
[15:03.500 --> 15:09.500]  This Dagny is, it was Marco Mendocino's campaign manager who's a sitting Liberal politician
[15:09.500 --> 15:12.260]  right now who called everyone terrorists the other day.
[15:12.260 --> 15:17.500]  And conveniently, these people seem to be holding a lot of keys somehow.
[15:17.500 --> 15:22.420]  If they have this media story, which is what it is, it's a story, the truckers have not
[15:22.420 --> 15:29.060]  agreed to this, nobody's going anywhere, nobody wants to go anywhere, that they've agreed
[15:29.060 --> 15:33.380]  to move or leave or something, the media will run with that and then the government will
[15:33.380 --> 15:36.620]  use that as like, oh, well, look, see, you know, they said they would, you know, do one
[15:36.620 --> 15:40.460]  thing and then they didn't and they're, you know, negotiating a bad faith and this kind
[15:40.460 --> 15:41.460]  of stuff.
[15:41.460 --> 15:42.460]  It's a setup.
[15:42.460 --> 15:48.940]  If you're reporting for info wars, this is Greg Reese, ladies and gentlemen, for those
[15:48.940 --> 15:53.900]  imminent false flagged across the truckers and the people is at Vandau video, get it
[15:53.900 --> 15:54.900]  and share it.
[15:54.900 --> 15:59.700]  Please stay with us.
[15:59.700 --> 16:07.140]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[16:07.140 --> 16:10.340]  until the populations rebelled.
[16:10.340 --> 16:15.860]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[16:15.860 --> 16:18.740]  anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[16:18.740 --> 16:24.300]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[16:24.300 --> 16:29.980]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[16:29.980 --> 16:34.260]  that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[16:34.260 --> 16:37.540]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[16:37.540 --> 16:41.940]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[16:41.940 --> 16:47.820]  Like Canada, where they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario
[16:47.820 --> 16:50.700]  and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[16:50.700 --> 16:52.620]  So pray for these folks big time.
[16:52.620 --> 16:57.940]  It's a very serious situation and stay tuned into info wars.com because truth is absolutely
[16:57.940 --> 17:00.700]  paramount.
[17:00.700 --> 17:06.180]  Something very rare is going on and it ends in just three days.
[17:06.180 --> 17:10.820]  Because of the time I'm taping this announcement on Thursday afternoon.
[17:10.820 --> 17:16.500]  Coming up this Monday, the biggest sale in four years of high quality storeable foods
[17:16.500 --> 17:19.500]  and prepare at alex.com will end.
[17:19.500 --> 17:24.980]  That's 25% off already the lowest prices are going to find on high quality storeable food
[17:24.980 --> 17:25.980]  at infowarstore.com.
[17:25.980 --> 17:34.580]  Again, you can go to prepare with alex.com or infowarstore.com and it takes you to the
[17:34.580 --> 17:36.580]  same place.
[17:36.580 --> 17:44.660]  50% off as well on super high quality products like x3, the deep earth, there's still iodine.
[17:44.660 --> 17:46.860]  That sale is going on as well.
[17:46.860 --> 17:47.860]  It doesn't end on Monday.
[17:47.860 --> 17:51.740]  It'll end in a few weeks and we're almost sold out of the product.
[17:51.740 --> 17:55.180]  Everybody needs to have horrible food to be prepared to become self sufficient now.
[17:55.180 --> 17:58.980]  The best high quality food at the lowest prices at infowarstore.com.
[17:58.980 --> 18:05.700]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault
[18:05.700 --> 18:11.580]  on our democracy, we will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[18:11.580 --> 18:13.580]  Domestic terrorists.
[18:13.580 --> 18:16.780]  The days of independent media are numbered.
[18:16.780 --> 18:19.900]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[18:19.900 --> 18:22.780]  They are now deep banking us behind the scenes.
[18:22.780 --> 18:26.580]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[18:26.580 --> 18:31.780]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps, the
[18:31.780 --> 18:34.500]  traders know they can shut us down by force.
[18:34.500 --> 18:38.220]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[18:38.220 --> 18:39.220]  So be it.
[18:39.220 --> 18:42.140]  Make them silence us by force.
[18:42.140 --> 18:45.220]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[18:45.220 --> 18:46.220]  Give now.
[18:46.220 --> 18:47.220]  Buy products.
[18:47.220 --> 18:48.220]  Donate.
[18:48.220 --> 18:53.780]  Before everything changes, we need you to carry us through to the end.
[18:53.780 --> 18:54.780]  Victory or death.
[18:54.780 --> 18:59.820]  Go now to infowarstore.com.
[18:59.820 --> 19:06.740]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[19:06.740 --> 19:12.340]  Not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[19:12.340 --> 19:15.980]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[19:15.980 --> 19:17.700]  That's done by design.
[19:17.700 --> 19:23.780]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[19:23.780 --> 19:27.820]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg
[19:27.820 --> 19:31.660]  group, the trilateral commission, the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds
[19:31.660 --> 19:33.780]  and the Rockefellers.
[19:33.780 --> 19:38.020]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media of the Bilderberg group didn't
[19:38.020 --> 19:39.020]  exist.
[19:39.020 --> 19:43.900]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public and its former head, showing the steering committee,
[19:43.900 --> 19:48.460]  is Klaus Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[19:48.460 --> 19:53.660]  And as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the second
[19:53.660 --> 19:55.980]  figure of worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover.
[19:55.980 --> 19:56.980]  We don't have a shot.
[19:56.980 --> 20:00.180]  If we do expose them, we can beat a measly.
[20:00.180 --> 20:14.620]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:14.620 --> 20:25.460]  Christina Freeland is who you need to be looking at in Canada, Trudeau is nothing more than
[20:25.460 --> 20:27.580]  the puppet.
[20:27.580 --> 20:31.460]  Christina Freeland is who's actually running the show.
[20:31.460 --> 20:37.460]  She's the finance minister, and she is the granddaughter of an extremely famous Nazi,
[20:37.460 --> 20:40.860]  just like Schwab is the grandson.
[20:40.860 --> 20:49.340]  She is a depopulationist on record, and she is the head, chairwoman of the Davos crew.
[20:49.340 --> 21:03.380]  And she is in full command of our closest partner, Canada, with a 5,000-mile border.
[21:03.380 --> 21:06.540]  And that's where we are.
[21:06.540 --> 21:09.220]  That's what's unfolding.
[21:09.220 --> 21:13.660]  Second of the hour, we're going to do a little bit of a deep dive on her.
[21:13.660 --> 21:16.500]  And that's why all you need to understand, this is authoritarianism, it doesn't come
[21:16.500 --> 21:19.660]  with army tanks, it doesn't come with troops, it's smarter.
[21:19.660 --> 21:26.380]  It comes with women talking softly and little pretty boys like Trudeau, like Tucker Carlson
[21:26.380 --> 21:34.180]  said last night with his 1970s haircut and talking real soft and manicured fingernails.
[21:34.180 --> 21:44.060]  He is a front man of these people, and Schwab rags that Trudeau is the model of the world.
[21:44.060 --> 21:50.900]  And everywhere where the Bilderberg group, Davos group alumni are in charge, Austria,
[21:50.900 --> 21:55.420]  Germany, the list goes on and on, what's happening?
[21:55.420 --> 21:59.660]  They're under medical martial law, they're being given medical IDs.
[21:59.660 --> 22:06.300]  It's the same thing for the prime minister of Australia and the prime minister of New
[22:06.300 --> 22:07.660]  Zealand.
[22:07.660 --> 22:11.100]  They are under direct control, it doesn't matter if they're conservative, it doesn't
[22:11.100 --> 22:13.180]  matter if they're liberal, it doesn't matter if they're under direct command.
[22:13.180 --> 22:16.700]  Now who else has been to this, Tulsi Gabbards and others, who clearly have turned against
[22:16.700 --> 22:17.700]  it?
[22:17.700 --> 22:22.100]  I don't 100% trust her, but she puts off a good aura, she does pretty much nothing
[22:22.100 --> 22:27.660]  but good work, just because you went to this, like Dan Crenshaw, doesn't mean you're a
[22:27.660 --> 22:37.820]  bad person, but everybody doing the bad deeds is an alumni of this, an alumni of specter,
[22:37.820 --> 22:39.740]  an alumni of chaos.
[22:39.740 --> 22:49.900]  The better name for it is Hydra, and I go, I see that in Marvel comic movies, yeah well,
[22:49.900 --> 22:54.620]  that's art imitating life ladies and gentlemen.
[22:54.620 --> 22:59.220]  The Red Skull is a communist Nazi movement.
[22:59.220 --> 23:09.380]  You're literally looking at the agents of Red Skull when you look at these people.
[23:09.380 --> 23:12.420]  What are we going to do about it?
[23:12.420 --> 23:16.540]  They've already injected half the world population that's estimated with a system that attacks
[23:16.540 --> 23:18.420]  your white blood cells on record.
[23:18.420 --> 23:24.140]  If you want to understand this all, we're going to hit it after a special guest joins
[23:24.140 --> 23:28.580]  us for one segment, journalist and veteran and individual that's been up there for the
[23:28.580 --> 23:32.860]  last two plus weeks in the middle of all this, who's been helping break the news of the imminent
[23:32.860 --> 23:36.980]  false flag information that former members of the Royal Mount of Police are also reporting
[23:36.980 --> 23:37.980]  on.
[23:37.980 --> 23:43.020]  But if you want to understand Christina Freeland, they are financing similar garbage like this
[23:43.020 --> 23:45.340]  that the German government's putting out.
[23:45.340 --> 23:52.900]  The poster reads, the future or climate killer, and it's a mother breastfeeding a baby with
[23:52.900 --> 23:56.780]  her three-year-old standing beside her.
[23:56.780 --> 24:01.860]  A beautiful picture of the Madonna, of life, of the future, of her amazing species, and
[24:01.860 --> 24:06.780]  it is a climate killer.
[24:06.780 --> 24:08.700]  The humans are the disease.
[24:08.700 --> 24:11.060]  They're the garbage to be taken out.
[24:11.060 --> 24:15.620]  And while Tucker Carlson's always topping himself, I didn't watch it till this morning
[24:15.620 --> 24:16.620]  when I was driving into work.
[24:16.620 --> 24:20.380]  I had the audio on of it, so technically I wasn't watching it.
[24:20.380 --> 24:25.260]  And he did a 13-minute opening monologue that we're going to link in the live show feed.
[24:25.260 --> 24:29.140]  I haven't written that yet, so during the break I'm going to go ride it and get it up.
[24:29.140 --> 24:31.460]  Under the live show feed of the show, I'm going to put the Tucker Carlson tonight from
[24:31.460 --> 24:38.140]  last night, in 13 minutes he calmly lays out the official worldwide martial law starting
[24:38.140 --> 24:45.020]  in Canada and how it is martial law and just how incredibly evil it is.
[24:45.020 --> 24:50.900]  And then we'll give you the cherry on top of the fact that Trudeau and Christina Freeland
[24:50.900 --> 24:56.780]  are graduates of SWAP's operation, but see, Freeland is a board member, senior board member,
[24:56.780 --> 25:02.300]  and the co-chair of the public arm of the Bilderberg group.
[25:02.300 --> 25:03.820]  Kind of a big deal, right?
[25:03.820 --> 25:07.860]  See, it's not the Russians declaring martial law, it's not the Chinese declaring martial
[25:07.860 --> 25:11.980]  law, it's not the Mexicans declaring martial law, it's not the Americans declaring martial
[25:11.980 --> 25:13.220]  law.
[25:13.220 --> 25:18.900]  It's the Bilderberg group through the Davos group declaring martial law.
[25:18.900 --> 25:25.460]  They've got infiltrators in all our governments, they're hiding in plain view and the FBI doesn't
[25:25.460 --> 25:32.620]  even have it on its radar screen because after all, the ADL says there is no global cult,
[25:32.620 --> 25:37.860]  there is no global power group, and if you talk about it and how it wants to poison and
[25:37.860 --> 25:41.900]  dumb down and destroy the general public, well, you're a bad person.
[25:41.900 --> 25:48.060]  You're a Nazi if you talk about all these grandchildren of real Nazis, working with
[25:48.060 --> 25:54.660]  the collaborator with the Nazis, George Soros, working with Nazis to start a war in Ukraine.
[25:54.660 --> 25:59.100]  Oh, there were Nazis in Ukraine after World War II.
[25:59.100 --> 26:01.780]  That was the last place the Nazis fell was in Ukraine.
[26:01.780 --> 26:07.460]  It wasn't until 1946, but see, I'm cursed with knowing history, the general public isn't,
[26:07.460 --> 26:09.500]  but I want to be a thousand percent clear here.
[26:09.500 --> 26:14.940]  This is not a Nazi conspiracy, the Nazis were just one spinoff of this eugenics science
[26:14.940 --> 26:22.500]  death cult takeover group that says mothers are and children are a disease, a tumor, and
[26:22.500 --> 26:23.980]  a killer.
[26:23.980 --> 26:24.980]  That's all coming up.
[26:24.980 --> 26:34.460]  And then there's just the incredible project Veritas is, it's on info wars.com, it's very
[26:34.460 --> 26:39.980]  very important where they have the high level FDA administrator saying this is about money
[26:39.980 --> 26:40.980]  and power.
[26:40.980 --> 26:44.060]  They buy us off with hundreds of millions, and now we force people to take our product
[26:44.060 --> 26:46.660]  which will hurt them, but so what?
[26:46.660 --> 26:52.780]  I mean, you want a bird's eye view and the evil into being a sociopath?
[26:52.780 --> 26:58.780]  He's talking about mass death and payoffs and bribery and ripoffs and just massive crime
[26:58.780 --> 27:04.020]  and you know what will happen, the FBI has already let James O'Keefe know.
[27:04.020 --> 27:07.500]  To keep doing this, we're going to set you up and put you in prison, they've already
[27:07.500 --> 27:12.060]  raided him, he's not backing down though.
[27:12.060 --> 27:15.100]  So that's how America works now, unbelievable information.
[27:15.100 --> 27:24.540]  We're going to go to break, today is the last day and I extended it from Sunday, as far
[27:24.540 --> 27:31.660]  as I can do it, with my Patriot supply, their entire catalog linked up at preparatrix.com
[27:31.660 --> 27:38.340]  or m4store.com, you just go there and search the storeable food and it's 25% off, ready
[27:38.340 --> 27:40.060]  to ship right now.
[27:40.060 --> 27:44.860]  And with all the craziness and all the inflation and supply chain breakdowns, it is my firm
[27:44.860 --> 27:48.540]  belief that one of the smartest moves anybody could make would be to get high quality storeable
[27:48.540 --> 27:52.940]  food that last decades is nutritious and good for your family, it's the choice I made many
[27:52.940 --> 27:56.500]  years ago for my storeable food, then I use it when I go camping or I give it to the poor
[27:56.500 --> 28:00.980]  or you know, give it to family and it just tastes great and I've been eating stuff I
[28:00.980 --> 28:06.100]  bought 10 years ago and then I bought new fresh supplies in the last few years and the
[28:06.100 --> 28:10.740]  power was out for a couple of weeks here last year, we had gas powered stoves in here cooking
[28:10.740 --> 28:15.780]  food for everybody when the feds turn the power off.
[28:15.780 --> 28:19.340]  So it's really smart to get this storeable food now, the globalist are planning a societal
[28:19.340 --> 28:22.180]  collapse, we don't know if they're going to be successful, we're trying to stop them
[28:22.180 --> 28:26.820]  while we also do backup plans and the backup plan funds info wars to help us stop them.
[28:26.820 --> 28:32.180]  So it's a perfect 360 win, a non zero sum game, the only way we fail is you don't take
[28:32.180 --> 28:36.260]  action, best place to spend your money is to keep us on here and get high quality food
[28:36.260 --> 28:40.140]  that stores really well and is packaged the best you can imagine for transport, ready
[28:40.140 --> 28:47.380]  to be delivered to you right now at prepareallux.com or AAA 253-3139, that ends today and then
[28:47.380 --> 28:54.380]  there's one week left on deep breath crystal iodine X3 at 50% off at infowarstore.com,
[28:54.380 --> 28:59.780]  we'll be right back.
[28:59.780 --> 29:03.940]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[29:03.940 --> 29:07.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing
[29:07.820 --> 29:13.900]  and so many people are deficient in iodine, it's not the soil anymore, most of the ocean
[29:13.900 --> 29:19.780]  is contaminated, but when you get high quality tri-iodine, all three of the healthy types
[29:19.780 --> 29:24.820]  together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly
[29:24.820 --> 29:25.820]  your immune system.
[29:25.820 --> 29:32.260]  So X3, the only tri-iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available
[29:32.260 --> 29:35.940]  again at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[29:35.940 --> 29:39.780]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about
[29:39.780 --> 29:44.140]  two weeks to get on average, you really need to experience X3.
[29:44.140 --> 29:47.100]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it, but
[29:47.100 --> 29:50.980]  particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing
[29:50.980 --> 29:54.420]  what it does for your body, it's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds
[29:54.420 --> 29:56.700]  the info war, a true 360 win.
[29:56.700 --> 30:00.340]  So again, X3 back in stock, 50% off at limited time.
[30:00.340 --> 30:05.260]  With all the craziness going on in the world, with the globalists plotting their next big
[30:05.260 --> 30:10.500]  lockdown, with the next phase of the Great Reset being a stage-cyber attack, with the
[30:10.500 --> 30:17.100]  deep state pushing a civil war, not just here, but in Europe and war with Russia, with the

[33:24.540 --> 33:40.380]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:40.380 --> 33:42.580]  What comes after you declare martial law?
[33:42.580 --> 33:45.020]  That's what it is.
[33:45.020 --> 33:48.580]  You suspend the right of due process.
[33:48.580 --> 33:53.940]  Well, next comes the false flag, next comes the provocation, next comes the burning of
[33:53.940 --> 33:56.220]  the Reichstag.
[33:56.220 --> 34:07.100]  When Hitler, just like Trudeau, only won a minority of votes, he was still able to become
[34:07.100 --> 34:11.820]  quote, president in the lower house in Germany.
[34:11.820 --> 34:17.580]  But after the Reichstag on February 27, 1933, Hindenburg stepped down and made him both chancellor
[34:17.580 --> 34:19.900]  and president in the parliament.
[34:19.900 --> 34:27.420]  The parliament voted, not the German people, to make Adolf Hitler the furor.
[34:27.420 --> 34:34.060]  And Trudeau won with about 30 percent in the last snap election he thought he would win.
[34:34.060 --> 34:39.340]  But still, they paid everybody off to vote to put him in, and then he immediately moves
[34:39.340 --> 34:40.340]  for dictatorship.
[34:40.340 --> 34:42.300]  And I'm covering that next segment.
[34:42.300 --> 34:48.180]  It's bone-shilling how Christina Freeland, one of the chairs, one of the main members
[34:48.180 --> 34:56.420]  of the Debo's group, is on record wanting authoritarianism and Sharia law, she said
[34:56.420 --> 35:00.060]  that on Bill Maher, said we should follow that, because they're allied with the radical
[35:00.060 --> 35:05.100]  Islamists, and that we should only have one child.
[35:05.100 --> 35:10.460]  And her grandfather was the head Nazi over the newspapers in Ukraine and Poland during
[35:10.460 --> 35:14.420]  Nazi occupation.
[35:14.420 --> 35:15.660]  Very nice.
[35:15.660 --> 35:19.300]  These people are unbelievable, so I appreciate him coming on on short notice.
[35:19.300 --> 35:22.980]  Jeremy McKenzie is a citizen journalist, very popular podcaster, he's been a frequent
[35:22.980 --> 35:27.220]  guest over the years with us and other shows on InfoWars, ragingdescent.com.
[35:27.220 --> 35:31.380]  He said five days before that Trudeau would declare the emergency, and he's been dead
[35:31.380 --> 35:32.380]  on accurate.
[35:32.380 --> 35:35.180]  He's got a lot of intel from military and police sources.
[35:35.180 --> 35:41.380]  And so tell us what's going on, Jeremy, how many days are we into this peaceful occupation
[35:41.380 --> 35:47.100]  there in Ottawa that's now had your public prime minister declare martial law?
[35:47.100 --> 35:50.940]  It's thanks again, I appreciate you for having me back again, Alex, it's gotten really disturbing
[35:50.940 --> 35:51.940]  and insane.
[35:51.940 --> 35:56.260]  It's funny that ironic that you make the Hitler comparisons when Trudeau is actually paraphrasing
[35:56.260 --> 36:00.140]  Hitler himself saying, how long do we tolerate these people, they're taking up too much space
[36:00.140 --> 36:02.580]  and what should be done about them and these kinds of things.
[36:02.580 --> 36:06.740]  Yeah, they've invoked the emergency act, which as I understand doesn't need to be voted on
[36:06.740 --> 36:11.500]  for a few more days yet, but it gives the government a lot of unilateral power to do
[36:11.500 --> 36:14.660]  a lot of crazy things that otherwise would not be permitted.
[36:14.660 --> 36:18.860]  It's only been used in its current iteration called the Emergency Measures Act before,
[36:18.860 --> 36:21.420]  it was previously called the War Measures Act, and it had only ever been used during
[36:21.420 --> 36:26.540]  the First and Second World War, and then later during his father's tenure as prime minister
[36:26.540 --> 36:33.020]  during the October crisis in which people in the FLQ who were a French nationalist separatist
[36:33.020 --> 36:36.620]  group were doing a bombing campaigns and kidnapping people and there were some murders
[36:36.620 --> 36:39.140]  and this kind of thing.
[36:39.140 --> 36:44.100]  To compare this, there's people downtown honking horns and have children in bouncy castles
[36:44.100 --> 36:48.100]  that's apparently akin and on the same level to these people, they understand, apparently
[36:48.100 --> 36:52.300]  they feel that threatened by it, to world wars and terror bombing campaigns.
[36:52.300 --> 36:57.260]  Gregory's followed a report on what's happening up there with the missing stolen guns and
[36:57.260 --> 37:02.900]  this former RCMP sniper saying he's getting intel, what can you tell us about that?
[37:02.900 --> 37:07.340]  Yeah, that's Daniel Bollford, he was previously on Trudeau's personal security detail and
[37:07.340 --> 37:11.020]  he's here the same things I'm hearing, I've been in touch with him that there is a truck
[37:11.020 --> 37:15.180]  full of guns that's gone missing, thousands of them in fact, in Ontario somewhere, I don't
[37:15.180 --> 37:17.700]  even know how that happens, aren't things like that, shouldn't they be guarded around
[37:17.700 --> 37:18.700]  the clock?
[37:18.700 --> 37:19.700]  Who's to say?
[37:19.700 --> 37:22.300]  But there are rumors that that is the intent is that there's going to be something planted
[37:22.300 --> 37:27.180]  maybe to give the police, you know, Cassus Belly, as it were, to move in and, you know,
[37:27.180 --> 37:31.660]  do whatever they're going to do, and now they're threatening the truckers and stuff downtown,
[37:31.660 --> 37:35.180]  they're handing out, you know, notices saying that they're going to seize their property,
[37:35.180 --> 37:38.900]  seize their trucks, their licenses will be suspended and revoked, there could be charges
[37:38.900 --> 37:45.620]  and criminal charges and stuff, it's getting really, the lengths they're going to to stop
[37:45.620 --> 37:50.740]  this has become insane and now there's been some arrests in western Canada, one of these
[37:50.740 --> 37:55.900]  guys I know and they're facing conspiracy to commit murder charges according to the
[37:55.900 --> 38:01.620]  media, and they're trying now to tie, you know, me and our, you know, community of people,
[38:01.620 --> 38:06.100]  you know, more podcasters and comedians and commentators and this kind of thing, and they're
[38:06.100 --> 38:09.380]  trying to paint this as some kind of domestic terror organization, some kind of domestic
[38:09.380 --> 38:11.980]  terror network to fuel this narrative.
[38:11.980 --> 38:16.500]  And well, that's what I've been told by my sources in DC, they're talking to people
[38:16.500 --> 38:19.900]  at the highest levels of the Canadian government, they say, what made him go ahead and do the
[38:19.900 --> 38:24.500]  civil emergency and accelerate this was that suddenly more and more, the police and military
[38:24.500 --> 38:28.340]  and plainclothes people were joining with the demonstrators and we were seeing defections
[38:28.340 --> 38:34.220]  out of the RNCP or the world amount of police, RCMP, excuse me, and that that was really
[38:34.220 --> 38:39.060]  scaring them, that it was a focal point of solidarity, not just in Canada but worldwide.
[38:39.060 --> 38:43.420]  Yeah, and they're desperate to try and discredit this and make it look like something that
[38:43.420 --> 38:44.420]  it's not.
[38:44.420 --> 38:48.420]  You've got people from the Canadian anti-hate network, which is a government funded partisan
[38:48.420 --> 38:50.140]  hack, it's a tabloid.
[38:50.140 --> 38:53.020]  The government pays the money and they've been smearing myself and my friends and other
[38:53.020 --> 38:58.060]  people saying that we're a neo-fascist, accelerationist, neo-Nazi group.
[38:58.060 --> 39:03.500]  There are black members of the community, Muslims, Jews, everybody, and they know that
[39:03.500 --> 39:04.980]  but they ignore it intentionally.
[39:04.980 --> 39:08.020]  They pretend as though we're something that we're not, so they can fuel this narrative
[39:08.020 --> 39:09.740]  so they can prop up this fake boogeyman.
[39:09.740 --> 39:12.940]  Well, you talked about this on my show years ago before this happened.
[39:12.940 --> 39:16.940]  This is classic stuff that Western governments have corruptly done overseas to divide and
[39:16.940 --> 39:18.900]  conquer a country before you take them over.
[39:18.900 --> 39:21.860]  What you're doing and what I'm doing is the opposite, we're trying to keep our countries
[39:21.860 --> 39:26.540]  together from these outside multinational break up operations.
[39:26.540 --> 39:30.780]  And I think that's what scares them, I mean they're seeing, that's the ultimate threat
[39:30.780 --> 39:31.780]  to them, right?
[39:31.780 --> 39:36.260]  I mean there's people again in this community that we're, you know, we call it the find
[39:36.260 --> 39:39.820]  your friends campaign, not find your terror campaign, you know, those guys having barbecues
[39:39.820 --> 39:44.340]  and they're coming together from all over the country of every background you can imagine.
[39:44.340 --> 39:48.180]  And you're seeing it downtown in Ottawa from people from all over the country, from every
[39:48.180 --> 39:52.740]  walk of life unified, you know, together against what they perceive to be and it's getting
[39:52.740 --> 39:57.660]  very, very hard to argue that it's not an authoritarian out of control government.
[39:57.660 --> 40:01.420]  And you know, having everybody unified like this is the opposite of what they want, they
[40:01.420 --> 40:06.860]  don't want to see people getting along for a common purpose and it's threatening them
[40:06.860 --> 40:10.220]  and it's scaring them and they're becoming desperate and saying crazy things about me
[40:10.220 --> 40:12.020]  and a lot of other people.
[40:12.020 --> 40:14.660]  I've seen you on the national news, we've known you for years, you're a really nice
[40:14.660 --> 40:17.460]  guy calling for peace, that's why they're scared of you.
[40:17.460 --> 40:20.660]  How do we know about infiltrators trying to take it over, also infiltrators trying to
[40:20.660 --> 40:25.780]  start up violence, that's got to really freak them out to have a lot of former senior federal
[40:25.780 --> 40:29.980]  police that have now left and are actually there helping do security, you know, to make
[40:29.980 --> 40:34.020]  sure that Trudeau can't pull a false flag, that's got to really scare them to know that
[40:34.020 --> 40:37.380]  everybody's looking for a false flag.
[40:37.380 --> 40:41.940]  And we're aware of it, you know, the boys are down at the veterans memorial there 24-7
[40:41.940 --> 40:46.700]  pulling security shifts on it because the fence was removed, we went down there and,
[40:46.700 --> 40:49.540]  you know, this is our memorial, it belongs to the people of this country, it belongs
[40:49.540 --> 40:53.060]  to the veterans and it belongs, people should be able to go up and honor these guys if they
[40:53.060 --> 40:56.140]  want to and they put up a fence around it because, you know, it'll be desecrated or
[40:56.140 --> 40:57.140]  something.
[40:57.140 --> 41:00.260]  That's right, they claim walking up on a mine that everybody always walks up on is desecration
[41:00.260 --> 41:02.700]  but they never show the evidence of desecration.
[41:02.700 --> 41:06.300]  Yeah, and I'd like to see a lot of the evidence for a lot of the charges and things they're
[41:06.300 --> 41:13.660]  saying about me and a lot of other people, we'll see and downtown, yeah, there are people
[41:13.660 --> 41:17.340]  that I know that are, you know, they're on leave or there are currently serving police
[41:17.340 --> 41:20.540]  officers or anything in between and now they're being investigated, they're being threatened,
[41:20.540 --> 41:25.340]  they've gotten agencies, people showing up at their homes, at their family members' homes
[41:25.340 --> 41:27.100]  and saying things to them.
[41:27.100 --> 41:30.900]  One guy's preparing to have his name dragged through the mud here on CBC, on the national,
[41:30.900 --> 41:34.860]  you know, they're very concerned about this, you know, insider threat as it were, which
[41:34.860 --> 41:39.740]  is simply just Canadian patriots seeing through the nonsense and wanting to help their countrymen.
[41:39.740 --> 41:42.020]  There's more and more guys coming from the army, from the police, from different, you
[41:42.020 --> 41:46.820]  know, the facets of our country every day and they're panicking and again, I've always
[41:46.820 --> 41:50.020]  said, you know, force a time to act like one and if they do, everyone's going to see them
[41:50.020 --> 41:51.020]  for what they are.
[41:51.020 --> 41:56.420]  And let's be absolutely clear, this is a globalist move, I've seen it all over, Canadians understand
[41:56.420 --> 41:59.780]  about the great reset in Klaus Schwab, I've seen the speakers talking about it, people
[41:59.780 --> 42:05.700]  on the streets, I mean, am I being too favorable or are Canadians getting really informed quickly
[42:05.700 --> 42:10.140]  that this is an outside globalist program?
[42:10.140 --> 42:13.500]  Most of the people, almost everyone downtown knew what was going on and that's kind of
[42:13.500 --> 42:17.020]  the beautiful thing about this is that it's, you know, the info war that you've been contributing
[42:17.020 --> 42:20.740]  to for a long time, thank you very much for that, has a lot of people know these, they
[42:20.740 --> 42:23.780]  know these names, they know what the World Economic Forum is, they know who Klaus Schwab
[42:23.780 --> 42:27.580]  is, they know who Christia Freeland is, she's our deputy prime minister by the way, so if
[42:27.580 --> 42:31.540]  Trudeau is resigned or removed or steps down, she's going to take over, isn't that nice?
[42:31.540 --> 42:34.500]  She's also in charge of all the money, she's got a bunch of multiple cabinet positions
[42:34.500 --> 42:40.100]  and she's deeply connected and just disturbing a human being for a variety of reasons as well
[42:40.100 --> 42:41.100]  that is our cabinet.
[42:41.100 --> 42:44.500]  We're going to talk about Christia Freeland when we come back in her bio, she's on the
[42:44.500 --> 42:50.060]  board of the World Economic Forum, that is the head public group of the Bilderberg group,
[42:50.060 --> 42:55.540]  there's literally captured her country and she comes from Nazi occupiers that her grandfather
[42:55.540 --> 42:59.420]  ran two countries for the Nazis.
[42:59.420 --> 43:04.060]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying
[43:04.060 --> 43:10.940]  and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain and when it comes to information,
[43:10.940 --> 43:17.740]  boy is that true today, we see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation, great
[43:17.740 --> 43:23.940]  reset combine, trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist
[43:23.940 --> 43:30.420]  nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors
[43:30.420 --> 43:36.660]  and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID-19 area, their
[43:36.660 --> 43:41.820]  world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it and none of
[43:41.820 --> 43:47.300]  it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and
[43:47.300 --> 43:52.500]  gas lit and that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence
[43:52.500 --> 43:56.660]  and that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and band up video links, that's
[43:56.660 --> 44:03.660]  why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[44:26.660 --> 44:33.660]  We've got to share them now more than ever, we've got to share them now more than ever.
[44:56.660 --> 45:03.660]  We've got to share in full wars links and band up video links and band up video links
[45:26.660 --> 45:50.740]  and band up video links.
[45:56.660 --> 46:06.820]  Something very rare is going on and it ends in just three days as of the time I'm taping
[46:06.820 --> 46:10.260]  this announcement on Thursday afternoon.
[46:10.260 --> 46:15.940]  Coming up this Monday, the biggest sale in four years of high quality storeable foods

[46:51.180 --> 46:56.820]  So, if you're going to be able to buy these, have horrible food being prepared, or become
[46:56.820 --> 47:00.900]  self sufficient now, the best high quality food at the lowest prices at infowarstore.com.
[47:00.900 --> 47:16.660]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:16.660 --> 47:22.940]  This has been said throughout history that when people are living through most incredible
[47:22.940 --> 47:28.020]  times, they don't tend to recognize it then, it's only later that they get up and brush
[47:28.020 --> 47:33.900]  themselves off and realize what they've just been through and I don't get up here and tell
[47:33.900 --> 47:36.540]  people horrible things just to scare you.
[47:36.540 --> 47:42.020]  I do it because it's the truth of what's going on and if we admit that we've got a real consortium
[47:42.020 --> 47:47.820]  of sociopaths and psychopaths that big corporations around the world have used behavioral psychology
[47:47.820 --> 47:55.820]  to give them questionnaires and to actually hire people that will carry out these crimes
[47:55.820 --> 47:58.740]  against humanity.
[47:58.740 --> 48:05.860]  So we have the big Wuhan lab whistleblower joining us for part of the next hour.
[48:05.860 --> 48:14.900]  She says that the Chai comms are releasing hemorrhagic fever, so that is coming up with
[48:14.900 --> 48:22.020]  Dr. Lee Ming Yan and then Dr. Lee Merritt's also joining us with Kate Daly.
[48:22.020 --> 48:28.740]  But I want to just remind you before we go back to our very informative guest that this
[48:28.740 --> 48:35.340]  story that's now on infowarstore.com from the wonderful folks over at Project Veritas
[48:35.340 --> 48:40.940]  who I know have been told if they don't stop going after Big Pharma, I said months ago
[48:40.940 --> 48:44.540]  I said the FBI is going to raid James O'Keeffe for something else but it's going to be about
[48:44.540 --> 48:50.020]  Big Pharma because they've caught Pfizer executives, they've caught FDA executives admitting the
[48:50.020 --> 48:56.580]  criminal activity and sure enough James O'Keeffe is not backing down, I'll just tell you that.
[48:56.580 --> 49:03.980]  So now they've got the most bombshell news ever, a recurring fountain of revenue FDA
[49:03.980 --> 49:09.300]  admits Biden planning annual shots including toddlers and of course Trudeau has already
[49:09.300 --> 49:16.300]  said this last year because he's the bellwether, he's the mouthpiece and the senior FDA executive
[49:16.300 --> 49:20.700]  officer brags that they've been given hundreds of millions and paid off to do this.
[49:20.700 --> 49:27.060]  I mean it's open and shut, 50 years in prison but James O'Keeffe will probably get indicted
[49:27.060 --> 49:31.580]  and swat teamed because they only told him son you shut your mouth, you and everybody
[49:31.580 --> 49:35.300]  who knows going to jail, well sorry James O'Keeffe isn't cowards like you, not everybody
[49:35.300 --> 49:39.620]  sells out okay but I want you to know I'm in danger, James O'Keeffe is in danger, we're
[49:39.620 --> 49:44.460]  all in danger folks, this isn't a fricking game alright, everybody should make a bigger
[49:44.460 --> 49:50.100]  deal about what Zero Hedge is doing, video has been out since yesterday afternoon, it's
[49:50.100 --> 49:53.780]  only got 200,000 views, I learned about it because Joe Rogan called me last night, I'm
[49:53.780 --> 49:58.620]  not name dropping, Joe really cares, have you seen this, have you seen this, no, we all
[49:58.620 --> 50:04.100]  need to be like Joe and be upset about this people, this is serious, fricking 200,000
[50:04.100 --> 50:09.940]  views as of this morning, pisses me off, wasn't even on info wars this morning, I'm not mad
[50:09.940 --> 50:16.820]  at my crew but I'm just like, you know, this is a damn war people and it's, I mean you
[50:16.820 --> 50:21.820]  should wait, I should just cover this the whole show, I mean these people are crazy
[50:21.820 --> 50:25.900]  because it's a new type of war, it's not militaries, it's not troops, it's bureaucrats through
[50:25.900 --> 50:29.740]  the medical system doing this to us and he admits by the way the vaccines hurt people
[50:29.740 --> 50:35.500]  and laughs about it, going back to our special guest, I really appreciate him being here
[50:35.500 --> 50:40.340]  with us, I want to play a clip of Kristia, that's Kristina, that's what I'm calling
[50:40.340 --> 50:44.420]  that in English, Freeland and we're going to talk about her because she's the real
[50:44.420 --> 50:51.140]  prime minister in my view, on the board of directors of the World Economic Forum, grandfather,
[50:51.140 --> 50:57.340]  Ukrainian but in Austria and Poland what ran the major Nazi newspapers during occupation,
[50:57.340 --> 51:03.500]  I mean a direct line with Joseph Goebbels literally, this woman is literally the granddaughter
[51:03.500 --> 51:07.700]  of one of the adjuncts of Joseph Goebbels, you can't make this up, I mean I looked him
[51:07.700 --> 51:12.860]  up, he's like famous in World War II, of course she works for Klaus Schwab, his grandfather
[51:12.860 --> 51:18.860]  sold the main flamethrowers to the Nazis, of course basically at cost, so here's a clip
[51:18.860 --> 51:24.300]  of her declaring financial martial law that will get Jeremy McKenzie's stake on it.
[51:24.300 --> 51:30.700]  We are announcing the following immediate actions, first we are broadening the scope
[51:30.700 --> 51:38.420]  of Canada's anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules so that they cover crowd funding
[51:38.420 --> 51:45.780]  platforms and the payment service providers they use, these changes cover all forms of
[51:45.780 --> 51:54.100]  transactions including digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, the illegal blockades
[51:54.100 --> 51:59.700]  have highlighted the fact that crowd funding platforms and some of the payment service
[51:59.700 --> 52:06.540]  providers they use are not fully captured under the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing
[52:06.540 --> 52:13.420]  Act, our banks and financial institutions are already obligated to report to the financial
[52:13.420 --> 52:22.300]  transactions and reports analysis center of Canada or Fintrack, as of today all crowd
[52:22.300 --> 52:29.860]  funding platforms and the payment service providers they use must register with Fintrack
[52:29.860 --> 52:35.580]  and they must report large and suspicious transactions to Fintrack.
[52:35.580 --> 52:40.020]  And you see the same thing with Biden, everything $600 or more reported in a year in your bank
[52:40.020 --> 52:46.260]  account, so the Holy Grail is the world social credit score ID tied to your vaccine passport.
[52:46.260 --> 52:49.020]  So they are just taking you to where Klaus Schwab wants it to go.
[52:49.020 --> 52:50.780]  We have the clip, I will play it in the next segment.
[52:50.780 --> 52:54.900]  He wants the microchips in you to buy and sell next and she is his direct agent.
[52:54.900 --> 52:59.660]  Is it fair to say Christina or Christia Freeland and I have got her own Wikipedia page linked
[52:59.660 --> 53:05.580]  to her on the board of this globalist group, grandfather famous Nazi propagandist over
[53:05.580 --> 53:11.060]  two countries in World War II, head propagandist in major countries, is it fair to say she
[53:11.060 --> 53:15.420]  is really the prime minister right now?
[53:15.420 --> 53:18.900]  I would put some stock in that, I think she is definitely making a lot of the decisions
[53:18.900 --> 53:24.420]  over there, you know, Airhead himself is busy, you know, hiding, cowering in a cottage this
[53:24.420 --> 53:28.180]  whole time, but they are making good on their threats, I already know people that have had
[53:28.180 --> 53:31.300]  their bank accounts disabled, they can't buy food, they can't do anything, their credit
[53:31.300 --> 53:35.180]  cards are coming back declined, they can't get money out of the bank, you know, and like
[53:35.180 --> 53:38.140]  I said, they are painting me and everybody else, they are setting up, you know, some
[53:38.140 --> 53:42.980]  of our patches and stuff are showing up in arrests, we don't know how they got there,
[53:42.980 --> 53:45.980]  you know, and they are saying they are throwing words like terrorists around and proceeds
[53:45.980 --> 53:51.220]  of crime and these kinds of things, it is so, it is very disturbing and insane and makes
[53:51.220 --> 53:54.060]  you wonder how far, well, I mean, I guess we know how far they are willing to go to
[53:54.060 --> 53:58.700]  take this and you would hope that something is going to stop these people, but, I mean,
[53:58.700 --> 54:03.180]  by the way, they are freezing independent media, that is what they want to target first,
[54:03.180 --> 54:08.900]  ahead of an attack, that is outrageous, the people's media, you can't have that.
[54:08.900 --> 54:12.300]  Right there, that is my friend Kristen right there in that video, you know, they are coming
[54:12.300 --> 54:16.300]  after everybody and these are just regular people, these are regular Canadian people,
[54:16.300 --> 54:17.300]  moms, dads, family members.
[54:17.300 --> 54:21.260]  And where is the solidarity of the, I mean, even when I got arrested and held for 10 hours
[54:21.260 --> 54:25.660]  when I flew into Kupfer-Bilderburg in 2006, the media all got freaked out and came down
[54:25.660 --> 54:29.580]  so the feds had to let me go in Canada and I went to Kupfer-Bilderburg because the media
[54:29.580 --> 54:33.620]  didn't like me, but they got their rights for being trampled, where is solidarity in
[54:33.620 --> 54:34.620]  media?
[54:34.620 --> 54:35.620]  Don't these idiots get what's happening?
[54:35.620 --> 54:39.860]  Well, funny thing about that Alex is that Justin Trudeau's government and the government
[54:39.860 --> 54:43.660]  of Canada has actually paid quite a large sum of money into the media apparatus.
[54:43.660 --> 54:46.660]  What is it, 600 million so far?
[54:46.660 --> 54:50.460]  That could be annually, I've lost track of how much they give away, it's insane and
[54:50.460 --> 54:53.900]  so, I mean, they don't bite the hand that feeds you and that's entirely the point, they
[54:53.900 --> 54:57.780]  give them bailout money all the time and they want to give even more, they said recently
[54:57.780 --> 55:02.180]  that the CBC shouldn't have to rely on advertising money to stay afloat so the government's going
[55:02.180 --> 55:03.500]  to give them even more money.
[55:03.500 --> 55:08.820]  The Ministry of Truth has literally become a very real thing, we're living in 1984,
[55:08.820 --> 55:12.580]  there's people surveilling me, we've been pulled over a couple of times, there's tracks
[55:12.580 --> 55:15.940]  all over the, we're like we're in the middle of nowhere, where we're staying out here and
[55:15.940 --> 55:19.900]  there's people out, I mean, I was in the infantry, I was an infantryman, they were reconnoitering
[55:19.900 --> 55:23.340]  the property, there's tracks through the snow all over the place, you know, what is going
[55:23.340 --> 55:24.340]  on here?
[55:24.340 --> 55:28.700]  And the police are coming to people's houses and saying, we notice you're on Facebook,
[55:28.700 --> 55:30.500]  we're watching you, that's on video.
[55:30.500 --> 55:34.300]  Yes, yeah, they're trying to intimidate people and it's like, you know, what is the crime,
[55:34.300 --> 55:36.060]  this is what people are like, well, what did we do?
[55:36.060 --> 55:40.460]  What you did was you're on the wrong thing, you're the political opposition, so they're
[55:40.460 --> 55:44.260]  target, they're using the media apparatus which they paid for and the police which do
[55:44.260 --> 55:46.620]  their bidding to destroy their political opposition.
[55:46.620 --> 55:51.620]  So let me ask you this in closing, you predicted the civil emergency five days before it happened,
[55:51.620 --> 55:52.620]  you predicted.
[55:52.620 --> 55:56.540]  What are you hearing, what's coming next, I mean, obviously you're sitting worried
[55:56.540 --> 56:00.100]  about a false flag.
[56:00.100 --> 56:03.300]  Well downtown, we took a spin through last night and now that they're saying basically
[56:03.300 --> 56:07.740]  anyone who's even downtown, you could potentially be arrested as a criminal in charge, you know,
[56:07.740 --> 56:11.700]  we drove around the inner and outer cordons are basically set up, they're kind of tightening
[56:11.700 --> 56:16.060]  the security noose around the central location there around Parliament Hill and now handing
[56:16.060 --> 56:19.140]  out notices today that warning truckers and everyone that they're going to be arrested
[56:19.140 --> 56:22.700]  in charge of their property seized, of their licenses revoked and they will be ruined and
[56:22.700 --> 56:25.220]  destroyed, assets seized, you know, et cetera.
[56:25.220 --> 56:29.220]  So I would expect in the next 24 to 48 hours they're going to move in here one way or another
[56:29.220 --> 56:32.620]  because I can't see them letting this go another weekend, that's when the most crowds come
[56:32.620 --> 56:36.100]  in, people come in, they hug, they shake hands, they meet all these people, they video and
[56:36.100 --> 56:39.420]  they see how wonderful it is, they go home and they tell their families and it's just
[56:39.420 --> 56:40.420]  getting worse and worse.
[56:40.420 --> 56:43.580]  So I can't imagine they're going to let this permit this to go through another weekend,
[56:43.580 --> 56:49.900]  they've already got down, they, you know, the Alberta one has gone, Manitoba, everywhere
[56:49.900 --> 56:54.500]  else is, this is it, this is, what's left here is what's left in Ottawa and I would
[56:54.500 --> 56:58.300]  imagine very shortly they're going to move in here and roll this up.
[56:58.300 --> 57:01.180]  Let's do five more minutes, I've got an important question to ask, I'm going to pose it now
[57:01.180 --> 57:04.180]  though and we'll go to break it, you can think about it.
[57:04.180 --> 57:08.020]  They've been there, what, 15, 16 days, how many days has this been going on?
[57:08.020 --> 57:09.740]  20, I think.
[57:09.740 --> 57:12.140]  Oh, it's 20, okay, 20 days.
[57:12.140 --> 57:16.180]  Trudeau's been hurt by this, the whole world knows he's bad, people have made their point,
[57:16.180 --> 57:19.420]  I know they haven't given up on the forced injections for truck drivers yet.
[57:19.420 --> 57:23.500]  I think if people just leave now, I'm not saying do this, I'm asking the question, leave
[57:23.500 --> 57:27.460]  now, you don't give them the violent clash they want, just like the Russians pulled back
[57:27.460 --> 57:33.660]  from the Ukrainian border and then Trudeau's removed by another snap election or something,
[57:33.660 --> 57:36.700]  instead of letting them set this up and attack these men, women and children.
[57:36.700 --> 57:40.140]  That'll hurt Trudeau and the globalists more in the end, but I just, I'm not up there
[57:40.140 --> 57:43.540]  with these folks like you are and I'm just saying discretion is the better part of valor
[57:43.540 --> 57:49.340]  sometimes, we'll talk about that when we come back in two minutes.
[57:49.340 --> 57:56.780]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[57:56.780 --> 58:02.900]  until the populations rebelled, they would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[58:02.900 --> 58:09.140]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives, but because
[58:09.140 --> 58:15.540]  of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers,
[58:15.540 --> 58:22.140]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government
[58:22.140 --> 58:27.220]  corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[58:27.220 --> 58:31.620]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[58:31.620 --> 58:37.980]  Like Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other
[58:37.980 --> 58:42.260]  areas of the world are following suit like Australia, so pray for these folks big time,
[58:42.260 --> 58:47.060]  this is a very serious situation and stay tuned into infowars.com because Trudeau is
[58:47.060 --> 58:48.060]  absolutely paramount.
[58:48.060 --> 59:14.220]  I'm so glad you called, elaborate on this, yes, now is the time in your small town or
[59:14.220 --> 59:19.220]  your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on your car or banner
[59:19.220 --> 59:24.180]  hangs over highways and it will be a chain reaction, what do you recommend people say
[59:24.180 --> 59:25.180]  on these banner hangs?
[59:25.180 --> 59:26.180]  I have a few ideas.
[59:26.180 --> 59:30.940]  First of all, help just as much as you can, don't form arrest, arrest while swab, the
[59:30.940 --> 59:34.460]  vaccine is poison, there's tons of things, I say just keep it short, keep it concise.
[59:34.460 --> 59:39.260]  No, I agree, arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates, the COVID backs is poison, beautiful.
[59:39.260 --> 59:42.860]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved and we could all be affected, so that's what
[59:42.860 --> 59:43.860]  I'm calling about.
[59:43.860 --> 59:48.020]  Thank you so much Chris, in Atlanta I really, really appreciate you calling us today, thank
[59:48.020 --> 59:49.020]  you so much.
[59:49.020 --> 1:00:17.960]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:17.960 --> 1:00:18.960]  I'm going to get it back.
[1:00:18.960 --> 1:00:19.960]  My bullshit.
[1:00:19.960 --> 1:00:20.960]  I've done had my fun.
[1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:32.680]  You know, I want to fix this peacefully and I'm totally nonviolent when it comes to offensive
[1:00:32.680 --> 1:00:33.680]  actions.
[1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:36.540]  If everybody that's pissed off is tired of being pushed around, the globalists are losing
[1:00:36.540 --> 1:00:38.400]  politically and culturally in spirit.
[1:00:38.400 --> 1:00:42.240]  They want violence, they want it now that they admit that.
[1:00:42.240 --> 1:00:47.440]  And so we need to be very, very careful right now and I'm worried if they go and kill some
[1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:53.840]  children, if they may do, to trigger an uprising, then they're going to hit a North American
[1:00:53.840 --> 1:00:54.840]  power outage.
[1:00:54.840 --> 1:00:56.880]  I guarantee they pre-program that.
[1:00:56.880 --> 1:01:00.400]  I've talked to military, CIA, people that are good, that they're being told to get ready
[1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:01.800]  for it to be eminent.
[1:01:01.800 --> 1:01:05.160]  If you think that the globalists have stopped, you don't know they're coming.
[1:01:05.160 --> 1:01:08.960]  But they want to have a violent confrontation first, then cut the power off.
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:10.960]  And so everybody better just get ready and better get prepared.
[1:01:10.960 --> 1:01:17.400]  I look at CHOP and these other autonomous zones, the left setup, where the police wisely
[1:01:17.400 --> 1:01:21.720]  left it alone for a few weeks, then it descended to crime, the public turned against it, then
[1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:22.960]  they cleaned it out.
[1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:23.960]  This is the opposite.
[1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:27.800]  These are good, hard-working people that have a real grievance who are saying, we want
[1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:32.640]  you to stop trying to forcefully inject us to track what we do to drive these damn trucks.
[1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:36.240]  And so I think they have a right to stay, and they should stay if they want.
[1:01:36.240 --> 1:01:42.800]  20 days into this, they've made their point, is it now time to at least get the children
[1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:43.800]  out of there?
[1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:46.560]  I'm not saying folks are using them as shields, they're not, but that's what's going to be
[1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:47.560]  said later.
[1:01:47.560 --> 1:01:51.440]  I think the globalists may use the children to actually trigger something.
[1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:53.200]  I'm not saying what Canadians should do.
[1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:55.600]  What do you think, as a Canadian?
[1:01:55.600 --> 1:02:00.800]  Well, Alex, the reason that there's children down there in the first place, a lot of them,
[1:02:00.800 --> 1:02:04.600]  is because these families that have lost their homes, they're living under these trucks now
[1:02:04.600 --> 1:02:08.760]  and they're missing payments on them, and other guys are missing mortgage payments,
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:10.200]  they've got nowhere else to go.
[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:13.000]  So when these governments, they act like they care about these people, they say, it's time
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  for you to go home.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  They think, well, we are home.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  We live on the streets.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.080]  So they've backed these people into a corner?
[1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:20.280]  Man, Dave, exactly.
[1:02:20.280 --> 1:02:21.280]  And that's worrying.
[1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:24.560]  I share your sentiment with that, and we talked to some other people, and you played some
[1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:25.560]  video of it.
[1:02:25.560 --> 1:02:27.440]  I said, when they come to arrest you, if they're going to do that, don't fight, that's what
[1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:28.440]  they want you to do.
[1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:29.440]  They want you to fight them.
[1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:30.440]  They want you to have an excuse.
[1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:34.440]  They want to have an excuse so they can bring the hammer down and just do whatever they
[1:02:34.440 --> 1:02:35.440]  need.
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:36.440]  They got to do to you.
[1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:39.640]  So what they do is, again, lock arms and single Canada, just let them arrest you if that's
[1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:40.640]  what they're going to do.
[1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:42.680]  And the whole world's going to see this, and the whole world's going to know who the bad
[1:02:42.680 --> 1:02:44.080]  guys are here.
[1:02:44.080 --> 1:02:46.640]  These are just men, regular people, you know, families.
[1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:47.640]  Sure, sure, sure.
[1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:48.640]  I totally understand.
[1:02:48.640 --> 1:02:51.520]  I agree with you, and this folks are more savvy.
[1:02:51.520 --> 1:02:52.520]  It's not a million people.
[1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:55.920]  It's not a one day event like January 6th where we got set up.
[1:02:55.920 --> 1:03:01.040]  I just really admire these people, and I agree, if they can stay peaceful and quite frankly
[1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:04.360]  let the police beat them on video, and that gets out, it'll bring down Trudeau for
[1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:05.360]  sure.
[1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:09.120]  So if they're willing to do it, then they're heroes, and we should just be praying for these
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:13.160]  great Canadians up there because they're fighting for all of us right now with their peaceful
[1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:14.480]  civil disobedience.
[1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:19.800]  Yeah, and we need to win the hearts and the minds of the people over there and have them
[1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:23.720]  understand because I do believe that most of the people in this country and our homes
[1:03:23.720 --> 1:03:24.720]  are good people.
[1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:25.720]  They've been lied to.
[1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:30.320]  They've been fed, you know, nonsense and lies and poison, and they're reacting in ways
[1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:33.960]  that are incompatible with the reality, with the truth because of the things that they've
[1:03:33.960 --> 1:03:35.320]  been told by these liars.
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:39.840]  And the longer we keep this up, the more their lies become obvious, and I mean, you know,
[1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:40.840]  look at the size of these crowds.
[1:03:40.840 --> 1:03:43.120]  This would have happened a year ago or two years ago.
[1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:44.120]  It's getting out there.
[1:03:44.120 --> 1:03:49.280]  So, you know, we just, you know, keep at it and, you know, win enough for these people
[1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:50.280]  over there.
[1:03:50.280 --> 1:03:51.280]  I totally agree.
[1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:53.280]  How close to a no confidence vote in parliament?
[1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:56.560]  I mean, I mean, couldn't Trudeau be removed right now?
[1:03:56.560 --> 1:03:57.560]  I mean, there's an incredible video.
[1:03:57.560 --> 1:04:00.800]  I know you've seen it just today where they scream and yell at him in the last three days
[1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:03.880]  in a row and run him out of parliament bipartisanly.
[1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:10.680]  I mean, he's got to him and Klaus Schwab got to know people are sick of his crap.
[1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:11.680]  It's definitely tense.
[1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:14.120]  And I mean, I mean, I don't envy a lot of the people in that building if they're, if
[1:04:14.120 --> 1:04:16.960]  they're, you know, because they like their cushy, you know, politician's salary and all
[1:04:16.960 --> 1:04:17.960]  the money they make and everything.
[1:04:17.960 --> 1:04:21.120]  But at the end of the day, this guy clearly looks like he's going down hard.
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:26.400]  So some of his own liberal MPs have turned on him, you know, and again, that's the kind
[1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:27.400]  of people these are.
[1:04:27.400 --> 1:04:30.440]  Mostly they're going to be self-interested and think about themselves and if they look
[1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:34.280]  down the road and see that it's not in their best interest to stay aligned with, you know,
[1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:37.880]  Trudeau's cabinet and his government, then then they won't and they're starting to jump
[1:04:37.880 --> 1:04:38.880]  ship.
[1:04:38.880 --> 1:04:39.880]  I think you'll see more of that happening.
[1:04:39.880 --> 1:04:40.880]  Exactly.
[1:04:40.880 --> 1:04:43.800]  And that's what leadership's all about is to be the wintertime soldier to get these
[1:04:43.800 --> 1:04:46.320]  other fair time patriots to go along with us.
[1:04:46.320 --> 1:04:47.760]  Jeremy McKenzie, amazing job.
[1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:48.760]  God bless you.
[1:04:48.760 --> 1:04:49.760]  Please keep giving us updates.
[1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:53.640]  Thoughts from my show, but others will follow reporting at ragingdissident.com.
[1:04:53.640 --> 1:04:58.600]  Thank you, sir.
[1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:00.560]  Hold out for months.
[1:05:00.560 --> 1:05:02.800]  X3 is now back in stock.
[1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:06.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:10.200]  and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[1:05:10.200 --> 1:05:12.200]  It's not the soil anymore.
[1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:17.880]  Most of the ocean is contaminated, but when you get high quality triiodine, all three
[1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:22.960]  of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but
[1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:24.680]  most importantly, your immune system.
[1:05:24.680 --> 1:05:31.080]  So, X3, the only triiodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available

[1:05:34.760 --> 1:05:38.600]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about
[1:05:38.600 --> 1:05:42.960]  two weeks to get it on average, you really need to experience X3.
[1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:45.760]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[1:05:45.760 --> 1:05:49.800]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing,
[1:05:49.800 --> 1:05:53.240]  what it does for your body, it's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds
[1:05:53.240 --> 1:05:55.560]  the info war, a true 360 win.
[1:05:55.560 --> 1:06:18.360]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off for life.
[1:06:18.360 --> 1:06:23.640]  Back this is Crystal Palace, Zincon radders declare DEF CON 3, scramble all alert aircraft.
[1:06:23.640 --> 1:06:27.440]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[1:06:27.440 --> 1:06:32.120]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War III.
[1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:35.560]  Target selection complete, time on target sequence complete.
[1:06:35.560 --> 1:06:43.720]  22 Typhoon class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning south out of Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:48.360]  Major reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan air defense zone.
[1:06:48.360 --> 1:06:54.080]  From the front lines of the information war, flush the bombers, get the subs in launch
[1:06:54.080 --> 1:06:58.360]  mode, we are at DEF CON 1.
[1:06:58.360 --> 1:07:00.920]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[1:07:00.920 --> 1:07:01.920]  You bet.
[1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:06.200]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[1:07:06.200 --> 1:07:09.960]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[1:07:09.960 --> 1:07:16.640]  3, 2, 1, impact, shall we play a game?
[1:07:16.640 --> 1:07:22.520]  How about global thermal nuclear war?
[1:07:22.520 --> 1:07:27.400]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:07:27.400 --> 1:07:31.280]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready, awaiting launch codes.
[1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:32.920]  We are in launch mode.
[1:07:32.920 --> 1:07:36.840]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[1:07:36.840 --> 1:07:41.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  We're in.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:58.800]  Things began, the only winning is not true ground.
[1:07:58.800 --> 1:08:01.640]  And Putin just played that game and pulled his troops back from the border, even though
[1:08:01.640 --> 1:08:03.720]  the West is massing there.
[1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:09.360]  Who is expanding is Communist China, make no mistake, and they own the Democratic Party.
[1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:15.360]  But thanks to people like Dr. Li Ming-Yan, we have a good chance of exposing this and
[1:08:15.360 --> 1:08:16.360]  stopping.
[1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:22.320]  And I'm not going to go over her amazing bio here, but we have got a lot to cover with
[1:08:22.320 --> 1:08:23.320]  her today.
[1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:26.840]  She joined us last year.
[1:08:26.840 --> 1:08:33.120]  Li Ming-Yan is a Chinese virologist known for publications, interviews, reporting on
[1:08:33.120 --> 1:08:36.200]  SARS-CoV-2 was made in the Chinese government lab.
[1:08:36.200 --> 1:08:37.800]  She said this two years ago, she's been vindicated.
[1:08:37.800 --> 1:08:39.120]  She said it before two years ago.
[1:08:39.120 --> 1:08:42.880]  She was warning because she was working at a major university monitoring at all.
[1:08:42.880 --> 1:08:43.880]  And so I don't get any of that wrong.
[1:08:43.880 --> 1:08:49.840]  I'm going to bring her on to reintroduce herself to you and then to go into the latest because
[1:08:49.840 --> 1:08:54.840]  she's saying the Chai comms were not the Chinese people, but the evil Communist Party, who've
[1:08:54.840 --> 1:08:59.560]  also used their COVID release to control their own people, are releasing something else at
[1:08:59.560 --> 1:09:00.960]  the Olympic Games.
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:01.960]  Quite the charge.
[1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:04.400]  If it was anybody else, I wouldn't have them on.
[1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:07.040]  I'd say that's too dangerous, only having one source.
[1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:13.040]  But she predicted and was warning people, as I've seen the news reports, before it was
[1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:14.960]  public about COVID-19.
[1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:16.280]  And now we know it was lab-made.
[1:09:16.280 --> 1:09:20.360]  We know that Fauci know there's a lot about that and are basically double agents for the
[1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:21.800]  Chai comms and others.
[1:09:21.800 --> 1:09:27.400]  So Doctor, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:29.320]  Li Ming-Yan, thank you so much.
[1:09:29.320 --> 1:09:30.600]  You're the expert here.
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:32.480]  Where would you like to start?
[1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:35.760]  Probably with some of your background for folks so they know what your track record
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:40.120]  is, how accurate you've been and how vindicated you've been.
[1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:42.360]  Hi, Alex.
[1:09:42.360 --> 1:09:44.960]  Nice to meet you again.
[1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:46.520]  Thank you for having me.
[1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:50.440]  And I want to say the network is not very good.
[1:09:50.440 --> 1:09:53.200]  So your word is time to time stop.
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:57.560]  And I will try to briefly tell what I can tell.
[1:09:57.560 --> 1:10:00.640]  So please repeat your question, please, OK?
[1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:01.640]  I understand.
[1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:04.080]  The Skype is not working well.
[1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:06.320]  Give us your background.
[1:10:06.320 --> 1:10:10.280]  You predicted all of this more than two years ago.
[1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:15.680]  And now you're saying the Communist Chinese have released a new weapon.
[1:10:15.680 --> 1:10:17.680]  Oh, yes.
[1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:20.760]  Two things.
[1:10:20.760 --> 1:10:21.760]  The first aid.
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:23.160]  I am a PhD.
[1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:27.000]  I am a virologist and also a medical doctor.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:32.680]  I worked at the University of Hong Kong, the WHO, H5 reference lab.
[1:10:32.680 --> 1:10:40.560]  And also I was, I am the independent coronavirus expert since the dust COVID-2 outbreak.
[1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:51.640]  And I came to America because I was a whistleblower and also the insider from Chinese all coming
[1:10:51.640 --> 1:10:59.080]  to the labs, which actually in a function makes the unrestricted by weapons dust COVID-2
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:06.200]  and then release it and launch the attacks worldwide cause the pandemic.
[1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:11.720]  And since that, we saw a whistleblower and so they, we saw Boeing, so they try to disappear
[1:11:11.720 --> 1:11:12.720]  me.
[1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:18.120]  And all the things I know, I try to tell it through the media things I came to the United
[1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:24.280]  States and also I wrote the three in report since the beginning, I told people, this is
[1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:30.440]  not from nature, this is Chinese Communist Party's military and also together with their
[1:11:30.440 --> 1:11:37.520]  international helpers, including Dr. Fauci and the others to launch the manmade disaster
[1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:39.480]  for all of us.
[1:11:39.480 --> 1:11:45.080]  And the other thing is when you talk about the new bioweapons, what I want to say is
[1:11:45.080 --> 1:11:56.200]  based on the entire region, very important from China, I received and I verified many
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:11:57.720]  of the things they mentioned.
[1:11:57.720 --> 1:12:07.000]  So in China, actually, because they didn't believe that hey, when COVID-19 for Chinese
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:12.800]  Communist Party, because none of them got real punished, got really punished.
[1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:20.080]  So Xi Jinping and his scientist, military people, they decided to try the other bioweapon
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:21.400]  viruses.
[1:12:21.400 --> 1:12:27.320]  And one of the things is the viruses which can cause the hemorrhagic fever, including
[1:12:27.320 --> 1:12:35.200]  marble, marble-like viruses, LASA, Hentai, all these type of, or Ebola-like viruses.
[1:12:35.200 --> 1:12:41.280]  And also they actually trial their secret antidotes in China.
[1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:50.000]  And based on this intelligence, Winter Olympics was one of the place, the opportunity, CCP
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:54.880]  planned to release the new virus or the new bioweapons.
[1:12:54.880 --> 1:13:00.840]  However, we don't know if we can manage to postpone it or stop it.
[1:13:00.840 --> 1:13:02.720]  Maybe they will do it later.
[1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:08.200]  So what I want to tell people is, please don't give more opportunity to Chinese Communist
[1:13:08.200 --> 1:13:09.200]  Party.
[1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:14.240]  Now, to fully prepare and stop their evil plans.
[1:13:14.240 --> 1:13:21.200]  I will tell you what is so frightening to me and so concerning, doctor, is that, correct
[1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:31.200]  my memory of I'm wrong, but you were warning in December of 2019 or even earlier of a escaped
[1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:38.280]  virus and that it was lab-made and that it was SARS-CoV-1 type.
[1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:41.760]  And then now that all turned out to be true.
[1:13:41.760 --> 1:13:43.920]  And now you're warning of hemorrhagic fever.
[1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:50.640]  So how did you know so early, first, and then moving to the hemorrhagic fever, you're saying
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:54.480]  you believe is being released at the Olympic Games.
[1:13:54.480 --> 1:14:01.840]  Please give us evidence of that or why you're saying that.
[1:14:01.840 --> 1:14:08.440]  The first is I want to say I start to talk about COVID-19 and reveal all the truth about
[1:14:08.440 --> 1:14:12.440]  this virus from mid-January 2020.
[1:14:12.440 --> 1:14:19.440]  At that time, I was on behalf of WHO reference lab did the confidential investigation about
[1:14:19.440 --> 1:14:21.440]  the Wuhan outbreak.
[1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:28.320]  And I got warned from the beginning that I would be disappeared if I don't keep silence.
[1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:33.920]  And until mid-January, because they still cover up, WHO cover up with them.
[1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:40.840]  And also, I confirmed that it's from the mid-January lab and it was not the natural outbreak.
[1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:41.840]  It is man-made.
[1:14:41.840 --> 1:14:44.640]  So I decided to tell it to the world.
[1:14:44.640 --> 1:14:47.480]  It's not only about prediction.
[1:14:47.480 --> 1:14:54.800]  It is based on the real information, firsthand information from China CDC headquarter office
[1:14:54.800 --> 1:15:02.920]  to the local doctors in Wuhan, combined with my expertise and also all this knowledge from
[1:15:02.920 --> 1:15:08.040]  my lab, because we are the top emerging infectious disease lab in the world.
[1:15:08.040 --> 1:15:14.440]  So now this time, what I want to tell people is, first, China has done based on the very
[1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:23.240]  confidential intelligence that they have done the trial using the CDC in China during the
[1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:31.320]  lockdowns happened in December 2021, that is the biggest city in China, Xi'an.
[1:15:31.320 --> 1:15:38.880]  It has over 13 million people and CCP government launched a military jail and they give the
[1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:44.640]  excuse as anti-COVID, make COVID-zero case in Xi'an.
[1:15:44.640 --> 1:15:50.080]  However, during that time, they also tried their hemorrhagic fever virus.
[1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:55.240]  Doctors, stay there, Li Mingyan, stay there, back in several minutes and talk about hemorrhagic
[1:15:55.240 --> 1:15:57.740]  fever.
[1:15:57.740 --> 1:16:05.200]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:08.400]  until the populations rebelled.
[1:16:08.400 --> 1:16:13.920]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:16.760]  anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[1:16:16.760 --> 1:16:22.320]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:28.000]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:34.480]  that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:35.480]  than ever.
[1:16:35.480 --> 1:16:39.960]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[1:16:39.960 --> 1:16:46.360]  Like Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other
[1:16:46.360 --> 1:16:48.680]  areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[1:16:48.680 --> 1:16:53.520]  So pray for these folks big time, this is a very serious situation and stay tuned into
[1:16:53.520 --> 1:17:23.440]  the M4Wars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.

[1:19:58.360 --> 1:20:17.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:17.160 --> 1:20:22.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:27.800]  The answer to lies is truth and I cannot hype this guest up enough.
[1:20:27.800 --> 1:20:38.080]  I remember in January, February two years ago that she'd been in the news warning that
[1:20:38.080 --> 1:20:43.400]  it had been lab made and that it had been released on purpose and we'd heard the reports
[1:20:43.400 --> 1:20:49.240]  that were released at the Olympics then or the military Olympics that were going on and
[1:20:49.240 --> 1:20:52.320]  I'm like, okay, we'll see what happens with that and then it all turned out to be true.
[1:20:52.320 --> 1:20:57.640]  So then now she says the Communist China comms are releasing hemorrhagic fever for folks that
[1:20:57.640 --> 1:20:58.640]  don't know what that is.
[1:20:58.640 --> 1:21:09.480]  Maybe she's a virologist, a doctor, she can explain it to us but that is quite a statement.
[1:21:09.480 --> 1:21:15.360]  That is quite an announcement and so I'd like her to slowly as she can because we know she's
[1:21:15.360 --> 1:21:19.520]  a scientist and a doctor and a lot of this is technical, explain to us what hemorrhagic
[1:21:19.520 --> 1:21:24.640]  fever is and I know she can't give away her sources but some of the providence of the
[1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:29.080]  intel and what the motive is and what she's saying is about to happen.
[1:21:29.080 --> 1:21:31.880]  I mean, what is this hemorrhagic fever going to do?
[1:21:31.880 --> 1:21:33.000]  How communicable?
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  Is it weaponized?
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:37.880]  Is it given gain of function?
[1:21:37.880 --> 1:21:40.440]  Please tell us everything you know, doctor.
[1:21:40.440 --> 1:21:42.720]  Okay, Alex.
[1:21:42.720 --> 1:21:48.280]  So hemorrhagic fever can be caused by different viruses.
[1:21:48.280 --> 1:21:55.520]  Hemorrhagic means bleeding and also plus fever, this is a group of symptoms and it is usually
[1:21:55.520 --> 1:22:04.520]  caused by different viruses which are all high-listal and also it can be Ebola, it can
[1:22:04.520 --> 1:22:12.240]  be Mavro, it can be Lassa, it can be Hentai virus and this virus, most of them are already
[1:22:12.240 --> 1:22:20.000]  verified as bioweapons and it comes from nature, from the animal direct to humans.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:27.360]  It also can cause not severe human-to-human transmission, I mean the transmission rate
[1:22:27.360 --> 1:22:35.160]  is quite lower than SARS-CoV-2, however, if you don't get treated in time, then you will
[1:22:35.160 --> 1:22:45.040]  get the best rate from over 10% to even 90% and we still, until now, don't have the well-known
[1:22:45.040 --> 1:22:47.160]  efficient drugs to treat it.
[1:22:47.160 --> 1:22:53.320]  You can be treated based on your symptoms and also according to the different viruses.
[1:22:53.320 --> 1:23:00.280]  What I want to tell people is the intelligence shows China has secretly conducted such trials
[1:23:00.280 --> 1:23:08.120]  in Xi'an in that city, why do they want to try that, because CCP this time, they changed
[1:23:08.120 --> 1:23:14.880]  the thinking to study the bioweapons, they first believed they have found the antidote
[1:23:14.880 --> 1:23:22.520]  and then they say this antidote will match the viruses they are going to use, so myself
[1:23:22.520 --> 1:23:30.160]  actually gave me the name of the antidote, CCP believed, the name is a drug from Johnson
[1:23:30.160 --> 1:23:31.160]  Company.
[1:23:31.160 --> 1:23:38.760]  That is a drug I have sent the link to your staff, maybe you can post it to the audience.
[1:23:38.760 --> 1:23:47.840]  The commercial name is Sutter Lab, and it is a drug designed to anti-cancer, anti-leukemia,
[1:23:47.840 --> 1:23:57.440]  it is a monoantibody, which is anti-sum-protein named St.D.38 in the cancer cells, so when
[1:23:57.440 --> 1:24:03.920]  I get this name, I and my team will examine why this can be the antidote for hemorrhagic
[1:24:03.920 --> 1:24:11.880]  fever viruses, and then we found CCP did conduct the studies to point out that when
[1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:19.440]  you get infected by the hemorrhagic fever viruses in your body, the cells abnormally
[1:24:19.440 --> 1:24:27.240]  expressed, St.D.38, this protein will increase, and then that is their thinking to use this
[1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:32.120]  antidote to kill these abnormal cells with St.D.38.
[1:24:32.120 --> 1:24:38.080]  Well let me just interrupt you doctor, so your source is so high level, you are on record
[1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:41.840]  working in one of the main big hospital virus research facilities in the region, one of
[1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:45.760]  the best in the world, we know that, your predictions have come out to be true, but
[1:24:45.760 --> 1:24:49.560]  your source is so high level, they don't just know that they released it, they even
[1:24:49.560 --> 1:24:53.960]  know obviously then what the treatment is, because obviously those that release it want
[1:24:53.960 --> 1:25:01.560]  treatment for themselves, that is just insane, I mean that is wild, what do they expect if
[1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:07.120]  you are right here, what is the goal, what is the motive of releasing this, why would
[1:25:07.120 --> 1:25:09.160]  they release hemorrhagic fever?
[1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:17.080]  What I want to say is, I cannot confirm whether they have released it already through the
[1:25:17.080 --> 1:25:23.680]  Winter Olympics, or when will they exactly release it, what I can tell you is, they
[1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:30.560]  released it in Xi'an, that city, they trialled it, because they also want to say the antidote,
[1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:38.280]  and they have to do the military drill, remember before the military games in 2019, they also
[1:25:38.280 --> 1:25:46.640]  contacted the military drill in Wuhan about the novel coronavirus, and so what you said
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:51.760]  two years ago came out later in documents from Peter Dazik, you are absolutely right,
[1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:55.880]  so to be clear you are saying they have tested hemorrhagic fever in other cities, but you
[1:25:55.880 --> 1:25:59.480]  are saying it is a threat, they may release it, so that is good news, you are saying they
[1:25:59.480 --> 1:26:04.360]  have not released it yet at the Winter Olympics, okay, I misread, that is good news.
[1:26:04.360 --> 1:26:10.640]  That is something, yes, I am still waiting for more intelligence information, and because
[1:26:10.640 --> 1:26:15.800]  this will be very confidential, so I never say they have already released it through
[1:26:15.800 --> 1:26:23.040]  the Winter Olympics, but I won't tell people, they fully prepared once this is a timing,
[1:26:23.040 --> 1:26:28.520]  and they believe the Winter Olympics would be a very good chance, so if the timing is
[1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:35.560]  good, they will manage to infect some foreign participants, and this virus can come to America
[1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:43.640]  directly, or maybe it can go through other people to America later, anyway, China believed
[1:26:43.640 --> 1:26:50.840]  they have this secret antidote, and also once it happened, China can use such antidote
[1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:57.440]  to kidnap the other government and the world, and also my team will have verified another
[1:26:57.440 --> 1:27:05.240]  thing is, although this is a very extensive drug, usually over 10,000 US dollar per dose,
[1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:13.440]  and usually it is short of storage, because not many people need these drugs, however
[1:27:13.440 --> 1:27:20.200]  in China, they managed to manufacture a lot of these drugs from last year, at least from
[1:27:20.200 --> 1:27:27.200]  last year, from different companies, they managed to get this drug patent from Johnson
[1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:33.840]  Johnson, and so China is going to repurpose it once the outbreak of hemorrhagic fever
[1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:40.640]  happened, that's why at that time, you have to listen to China, and I won't tell people
[1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:48.640]  is this kind of viruses, although it's very lethal, but it's difficult because the pandemic,
[1:27:48.640 --> 1:27:55.280]  it usually cause the small outbreak, because people are very, very unarmed of such viruses.
[1:27:55.280 --> 1:28:00.640]  Sure, so are you saying, just to interrupt, doctor, because I want to track all this right,
[1:28:00.640 --> 1:28:06.240]  I want to make another mistake here, you're saying the Chinese communists are prepositioned
[1:28:06.240 --> 1:28:11.960]  and have manufactured this rare drug ahead of their potential release of it to profit
[1:28:11.960 --> 1:28:12.960]  from it?
[1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:21.080]  Yes, they are already preparing that, they put this expensive drug into the national
[1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:29.160]  insurance system, this is very unusual, our government is never so nice to people, it's
[1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:37.120]  a very good reason that they can produce this drug nationwide, and also they can reduce
[1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:42.240]  the cost of this drug, so I try to rely on that.
[1:28:42.240 --> 1:28:46.320]  All right, stay right there doctor, your skype is breaking up again, Lee Ming Yan is
[1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:52.880]  with us, you can find her at Dr. Lee Ming Yan on GAB, and Twitter Dr. Lee Ming Yan 1,
[1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:57.160]  DRLIMENGYAN.
[1:28:57.160 --> 1:29:02.040]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying,
[1:29:02.040 --> 1:29:08.560]  empowering, and fulfilling, it's going to be hard to attain, and when it comes to information,
[1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:15.680]  boy is that true today, we see the entire global corrupt, anti-human depopulation, great
[1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:21.880]  reset combine, trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist
[1:29:21.880 --> 1:29:28.400]  nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world, and of doctors
[1:29:28.400 --> 1:29:34.600]  and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their
[1:29:34.600 --> 1:29:39.760]  world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it, and none of
[1:29:39.760 --> 1:29:45.280]  it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and
[1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:50.360]  gas lit, and that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence,
[1:29:50.360 --> 1:29:54.640]  and that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and band up video links, that's
[1:29:54.640 --> 1:29:57.240]  why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[1:29:57.240 --> 1:30:03.040]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock, ladies and gentlemen, just like our information

[1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:09.680]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, then coming to your house
[1:31:09.680 --> 1:31:16.160]  and threatening in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[1:31:16.160 --> 1:31:20.560]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process, where they come and
[1:31:20.560 --> 1:31:24.720]  take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[1:31:24.720 --> 1:31:26.520]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[1:31:26.520 --> 1:31:30.760]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many
[1:31:30.760 --> 1:31:35.040]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military

[1:32:59.280 --> 1:33:10.160]  Feeding a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:10.160 --> 1:33:16.560]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[1:33:16.560 --> 1:33:18.560]  the info war.
[1:33:18.560 --> 1:33:26.400]  Well, she predicted first that COVID-19 was made in a lab and had been released for anybody
[1:33:26.400 --> 1:33:27.400]  else to.
[1:33:27.400 --> 1:33:30.640]  I remember seeing her on Fox News like a year and a half ago, talking about it, and I'm
[1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:33.360]  like, well, later that all came out.
[1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:37.200]  And now she's saying that the Communist Chinese have tested hemorrhagic fever in different
[1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:39.920]  cities, and they may release it at the Olympics.
[1:33:39.920 --> 1:33:42.720]  Some of the news picked it up and said they had released it.
[1:33:42.720 --> 1:33:46.920]  And then she talks about Chinese Communist Big Pharma wanting to profit off a drug they
[1:33:46.920 --> 1:33:52.360]  already know is the therapeutic for it, just like the new Project Veritas report will play
[1:33:52.360 --> 1:33:56.960]  part of the next segment, where they have a senior FDA executive saying, we get paid
[1:33:56.960 --> 1:34:03.320]  hundreds of millions, the vaccine doesn't work, but we're using this to basically take
[1:34:03.320 --> 1:34:04.320]  over.
[1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:09.840]  A recurring fountain of revenue.
[1:34:09.840 --> 1:34:13.720]  So Dr. Lee Ming-Yun, thank you so much for joining us, we can find you on Twitter, at
[1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:21.920]  Dr. Lee Ming-Yun, that's D-R-L-I-M-E-N-G-Y-A-N-1, and again, there's so much to say, so much
[1:34:21.920 --> 1:34:22.920]  to break down.
[1:34:22.920 --> 1:34:23.920]  Thank you for your courage.
[1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:31.560]  I just got to ask you, how did, I mean, obviously you were working at one of the major facilities,
[1:34:31.560 --> 1:34:35.600]  you saw what was going on, why did you have the courage to come out, or why were you the
[1:34:35.600 --> 1:34:41.520]  first to talk about this, and now two years into this, what do you think of the lockdowns
[1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:48.160]  and the forced inoculations and Fauci and Gates, and just as a human being, what is
[1:34:48.160 --> 1:34:54.640]  your view of this, in my view, biomedical tyranny we're now living under?
[1:34:54.640 --> 1:34:55.640]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:34:55.640 --> 1:35:02.960]  So my reason to tell it out is very simple, because I am the medical doctor, and also
[1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:05.000]  I'm the viral oncologist.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:10.960]  Once I see what happened, and once I know what will happen, I think it's urgent, and
[1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:17.680]  I must tell people, I will be guilty if I keep the secret with me, and I see what happened
[1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:18.680]  in the future.
[1:35:18.680 --> 1:35:25.560]  So that's my reason, and I want to tell people is from the beginning, I tried to work with
[1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:32.040]  many other people, including initially the Chinese YouTube blogger, who based in US,
[1:35:32.040 --> 1:35:39.640]  to use his anti-CCP broadcast to deliver this message, and we managed to change Xi Jinping's
[1:35:39.640 --> 1:35:47.320]  strategies, and also postpone and reduce the damage at that time, and also after that I
[1:35:47.320 --> 1:35:54.760]  keep telling, especially since I escaped to America, I told people that Dr. Fauci didn't
[1:35:54.760 --> 1:36:00.640]  tell the right things, he's lying, and also Dr. Peter Dasha is lying, and there are so
[1:36:00.640 --> 1:36:07.520]  many infiltrations from military, from civilian scientists, and under control of Chinese Communist
[1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:15.440]  Party in the US and other countries, and in the US there are also a lot of back scientists,
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:21.280]  they didn't do the right thing, they will help China for their own benefits, including
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:26.760]  the people in John Hopkins, and also in many other good universities.
[1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:34.000]  So basically, Chinese Communist Party using coronavirus as the unrestricted bioweapon,
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:41.240]  that means they cannot only use that virus to cause such big damage, unless they also
[1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:47.760]  confound with misinformation, censorship, and also propaganda, and also I won't tell
[1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:54.320]  people, I'm happy to say, after two years effort, I see a lot of brave people, brilliant
[1:36:54.320 --> 1:37:00.960]  people, patriots from America, they realize what happened, they stand up together, call
[1:37:00.960 --> 1:37:08.440]  for anti-Chinese Communist Party and anti-statue mandate policies, which actually means communist
[1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:14.840]  ideology, and also I won't tell people, we must know what the Chinese Communist Party
[1:37:14.840 --> 1:37:21.400]  is going to do, so they are unrestricted bioweapon, for example, this time, when they are going
[1:37:21.400 --> 1:37:28.880]  to use hemorrhagic fever viruses, they have fully prepared also propaganda and misinformation.
[1:37:28.880 --> 1:37:35.560]  You may not know, but Chinese government already started the propaganda from months ago to
[1:37:35.560 --> 1:37:42.680]  blame America, they said America government will release other bioweapons, and also, for
[1:37:42.680 --> 1:37:49.240]  example, they use the news of the monkey escaping from the Pennsylvania that's trunk to make
[1:37:49.240 --> 1:37:55.400]  the misinformation that Ebola-like hemorrhagic fever will come out because monkey escaped
[1:37:55.400 --> 1:38:03.000]  from American lab, all like this, so this time, once they release these viruses, they
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:09.040]  will also use this propaganda to cheat you, you may hurt such hemorrhagic fever, come
[1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:15.200]  from nature, or come from other countries, seems not related to China, you may hurt that
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:21.600]  this is American government did it to undermine China, you may hurt a lot of misinformation.
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:25.480]  By the way, doc, you're on fire right now, and I remember when that happened three weeks
[1:38:25.480 --> 1:38:30.520]  ago, I thought that looks like a perfect cover story, then the supposed woman that saw the
[1:38:30.520 --> 1:38:35.680]  wreck, she got a fever, and I just said, that just sounds like a Hollywood script, and you're
[1:38:35.680 --> 1:38:41.200]  saying that's a cover for if there's now this hemorrhagic release, they'll say it's
[1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:42.640]  naturally occurring, wow.
[1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:51.560]  That is something CCP used, they have used it in China, they make this news very, very
[1:38:51.560 --> 1:38:52.560]  popular.
[1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:59.000]  They said this is the beginning of hemorrhagic fever in America, however, we don't know what
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:06.160]  exactly happened to the monkey, we also demand the investigation about that monkey, why it
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:13.240]  is not well protected, because this is a lab monkey, usually we believe it's not infectious
[1:39:13.240 --> 1:39:19.160]  monkey, because that not fits the protocol, but if it escaped, we must know what this
[1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:26.400]  monkey delivered to the lab for, which lab is going to accept it from which lab, and
[1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:31.560]  what happened to those monkeys, and did they diagnose the monkey whether they're healthy
[1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:36.880]  enough or not, and we also need to know this, because we should not give the opportunity
[1:39:36.880 --> 1:39:41.320]  to the Chinese Communist Party to misuse such information.
[1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:48.440]  Wow, doc, what else is on your radar screen, what else are you concerned about, do you
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:53.880]  have any other information about any other CHICOM plots that they've got cooking?
[1:39:53.880 --> 1:40:01.840]  CCP, I really want to tell people, it's not a joke, it's not conspiracy, if you can read
[1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:09.400]  in Chinese, you will see Chinese government already established the next five years plan
[1:40:09.400 --> 1:40:17.960]  based on the biosecurity, remember biosecurity in CCP's world means bioweapon program, so
[1:40:17.960 --> 1:40:25.480]  for example, in 2020, the CCP's SYNC tank from Shanghai Pasteur Institute, they have
[1:40:25.480 --> 1:40:32.760]  already said we're going to use the control and prevention of emerging infectious disease
[1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:40.440]  to achieve Xi Jinping's human community that sharing one fate all over the world, that
[1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:46.920]  means all over the world under CCP's control, they already make sure that it's their central
[1:40:46.920 --> 1:40:53.960]  plan, and if you check the industries in the biotech field, after two years pandemic,
[1:40:53.960 --> 1:41:01.000]  they were already developed, so these industries earn a lot of profits from the pandemic, and
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:07.480]  if China is going to really small, and as the intelligence already showed, they have prepared
[1:41:07.480 --> 1:41:13.400]  antidotes, although we don't know whether this is really still efficient, and we even don't
[1:41:13.400 --> 1:41:20.760]  know the clinical results because China never share this data to us, but if it happens, China
[1:41:20.760 --> 1:41:28.120]  also can use this to earn a lot, so that's why I won't tell people, don't be panic, first,
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:34.600]  this is not something can cause the pandemic, they won't cause panic and chaos, the second
[1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:41.480]  thing is, you have to be well prepared, and you should not give more chance to CCP, because
[1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:46.920]  they have more viruses in their lab, that's I also said from the beginning.
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:52.840]  Absolutely, so the Communist Chinese ally with globalist Bilderberg group, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates,
[1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:59.320]  you can see it all the mainstream media, using it to all power grab takeover, shut down US industry,
[1:41:59.320 --> 1:42:04.360]  increase all their globalist investments in China massively, and just use it to bring in a worldwide
[1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:09.800]  authoritarianism from Canada to places like Spain and Austria, where they have forced
[1:42:09.800 --> 1:42:15.080]  injections now taking place. You can see it all, you can see Dasik covering up the lab,
[1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:19.960]  covering up the Chinese government involvement, you can see our media doing it, and it's all
[1:42:19.960 --> 1:42:25.320]  starting to come out. Well, simply amazing, I'm not going to keep you for the whole next segment,
[1:42:25.320 --> 1:42:29.080]  because I know you've got to go, and I also want to play this incredible Project Veritas
[1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:34.920]  report, but I just wanted to ask you briefly, we come back ways to stop the CCP and their
[1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:40.200]  globalist allies in the West, how do we stop the next phase, as you said, with this whole
[1:42:40.200 --> 1:42:45.160]  armory, they've got all these other deadly viruses they've cooked up, that they're about to release
[1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:50.520]  on us, that then the left worldwide will use as a pretext to take full control. Stay with us,
[1:42:50.520 --> 1:42:59.640]  this is incredible information. With all the craziness going on in the world,
[1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:05.160]  with the globalist plotting their next big lockdown, with the next phase of the Great Reset
[1:43:05.160 --> 1:43:10.360]  being a stage cyber attack, with the deep state pushing a civil war, not just here,
[1:43:11.080 --> 1:43:16.840]  but in Europe and war with Russia, with the massive inflation and all the other garbage
[1:43:16.840 --> 1:43:22.280]  that's taking place, like supply chain right now, you need to get prepared now with high quality
[1:43:22.280 --> 1:43:28.520]  storable food that is ready to ship. And it's been four years since my Patriot supply
[1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:36.680]  at PrepareWithAlex.com has offered their storable food at 25% off, four years. But right now,
[1:43:36.680 --> 1:43:43.480]  it's 25% off until February 13, 2022, a little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this
[1:43:43.480 --> 1:43:50.360]  to get 25% off at PrepareWithAlex.com on the entire catalog of my Patriot supply.
[1:43:50.360 --> 1:43:55.960]  Act now, get prepared now, this is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[1:43:55.960 --> 1:44:03.000]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games. I like going to concerts. I like
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:08.520]  going to play golf. I like going out to dinner. I like the metropolitan life. I like everything
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:15.160]  that comes with this. But see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat
[1:44:15.160 --> 1:44:20.360]  run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas, because unless we change course soon,
[1:44:20.360 --> 1:44:25.000]  it's all crashing down. Is it time to just move out to the woods? Just time to go get a piece of
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:29.160]  property in the woods, just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the
[1:44:29.160 --> 1:44:33.320]  land? That's the survival instinct. But see, the worldly part of me that's still probably the
[1:44:33.320 --> 1:44:38.120]  majority part of me says, no, no, no, no, no, stay in the city. The survival instinct says,
[1:44:38.120 --> 1:44:41.720]  get the hell out of anywhere they've ever noticed that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[1:44:41.720 --> 1:44:48.200]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[1:44:48.200 --> 1:44:53.400]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies. And so we have
[1:44:53.400 --> 1:45:01.320]  the best ones at infowarstore.com. There is very little contemporary study in the world
[1:45:02.040 --> 1:45:08.440]  of the planet's ruling class, not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States,
[1:45:08.440 --> 1:45:14.600]  not anywhere. Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class? And that's done by design.
[1:45:15.320 --> 1:45:20.600]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:25.640]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment that's out of the Bilderberg
[1:45:25.640 --> 1:45:29.480]  group, the trilateral commission, the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds
[1:45:29.480 --> 1:45:34.680]  and the Rockefellers. Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media,
[1:45:34.680 --> 1:45:39.640]  the Bilderberg group, didn't exist. Well, now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head,
[1:45:40.360 --> 1:45:44.920]  still on the steering committee, is Klaus Schwab. And he has set up the great reset in
[1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:49.880]  global government and give, as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head
[1:45:49.880 --> 1:45:54.360]  on about the fact that they are worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover. We don't
[1:45:54.360 --> 1:45:59.160]  have a shot. If you expose them, we can beat them easily. Experience the next level in high-powered
[1:45:59.160 --> 1:46:04.680]  energy new tropics with our latest brain force offering, Brain Force Ultra. Now it is easier

[1:46:20.360 --> 1:46:25.720]  super ingredients behind Brain Force Ultra include, Guarani seed, which is loaded with
[1:46:25.720 --> 1:46:31.160]  energy compounds and antioxidants that have been used by Amazonian tribes for centuries,
[1:46:31.160 --> 1:46:36.280]  Alpha GPC, a natural compound found in the brain that delivers an essential nutrient,
[1:46:36.280 --> 1:46:42.040]  Koli and Ginkoli, which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant content. This product
[1:46:42.040 --> 1:46:46.600]  is more than twice the servings of our Brain Force Plus as well, so you know it's packed full of the
[1:46:46.600 --> 1:46:52.440]  good stuff. Destroy that brain fog today and secure your bottle of Brain Force Ultra before
[1:46:52.440 --> 1:47:02.280]  it is completely sold out at M4store.com. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:47:02.280 --> 1:47:18.200]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:28.200]  Dr. Lee Ming-Yun is our guest at McTownian folks.
[1:47:28.200 --> 1:47:32.840]  I know a lot of you know who she is and you've got good memories, but she was
[1:47:33.560 --> 1:47:38.440]  out there two plus years ago warning. She was the first person and I'm sitting there in like
[1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:42.040]  January 2020 going, how does this lady know all this? And I was a little skeptical and then now
[1:47:42.040 --> 1:47:46.280]  it all came out and she was right. And now she's laying more information on us and I forgot about
[1:47:46.280 --> 1:47:51.080]  the monkeys and the hemorrhagic fever and obvious cover story. I mean, that's just ridiculous.
[1:47:51.080 --> 1:47:58.760]  That's like a zombie apocalypse movie. So how do we counter the chai comms and their double agents?
[1:47:58.760 --> 1:48:03.320]  Even the FBI director now says, okay, it's not white supremacists that are the greatest threat.
[1:48:03.320 --> 1:48:07.880]  They're not even on the list of real threats. It's the communist Chinese. He's quote, blown away
[1:48:07.880 --> 1:48:13.640]  by it. Yeah, it's all over. Most of the Democrats we know put a Chinese communist agent literally in
[1:48:13.640 --> 1:48:19.880]  their office as part of their deal with the CCP. So this infiltration is like a marriage
[1:48:19.880 --> 1:48:26.440]  of the leftist elite with the chai comms in my view. How do we counter that? And what do we do to stop
[1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:34.520]  this? The first thing is Americans need to understand Chinese communist party, understand their
[1:48:34.520 --> 1:48:41.240]  tactics. That's why you always say why I can't tell this because I grew up from mainland China.
[1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:48.680]  I finished my studies there and also I have been there for over 30 years. I know it and also I
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:55.160]  want to tell people is all of these are not conspiracy. These are intelligence and these are
[1:48:55.160 --> 1:49:02.760]  also based on my and my English search teams verification. So I will tell you based on the
[1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:10.120]  scientific analyze, based on the data and you can verify by yourself. What I want to tell people is
[1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:17.480]  you see, CCP already celebrate their COVID trophy and also Xi Jinping control the country,
[1:49:17.480 --> 1:49:25.560]  even worse. And so that's why in Xi'an, in the lockdown with 30 million people in December 2021,
[1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:32.600]  you barely can get any useful information from the media. However, there were also many brief
[1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:39.640]  Chinese people there. They try to take their life risk to deliver the message to me and my team
[1:49:39.640 --> 1:49:47.080]  because they believe we can help them to reveal this. What we want to do is we have
[1:49:47.080 --> 1:49:54.600]  to work all together to reveal CCP's tactics, let the world know what is the real information.
[1:49:54.600 --> 1:50:01.720]  So also, I want to remind people, last time when COVID happened, most of you cannot believe
[1:50:01.720 --> 1:50:09.880]  that international scientists like Fauci Dajie worked with Chinese Communist Party to cover up
[1:50:09.880 --> 1:50:18.200]  particular. However, CCP not only control them, CCP also infiltrate into other countries,
[1:50:18.200 --> 1:50:28.360]  especially like the countries in Southeast Asia and also Africa. So if you check, you can verify
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:36.040]  that how CCP study hemorrhagic fever viruses in the West Africa. They built the map there with
[1:50:36.040 --> 1:50:42.440]  their military. They study it everywhere and they send so many scientists there to understand
[1:50:42.440 --> 1:50:50.040]  hemorrhagic fever viruses. So you should know, CCP already put a lot of efforts studying the
[1:50:50.040 --> 1:50:56.840]  bioweapons. Last time, they made the COVID and there is man-made evidence. I found out the
[1:50:56.840 --> 1:51:03.400]  smoking gun. Also, I found out it's not from nature. This time, they changed the thinking.
[1:51:03.400 --> 1:51:09.960]  They want to tell you this is even no gain of function change. It's just the nature,
[1:51:09.960 --> 1:51:18.760]  these bioweapon viruses like Masa, like Mabel, it can be from West Africa, it comes from maybe red
[1:51:18.760 --> 1:51:25.240]  or bad, and it comes to you, it will cause outbreak, all of these other things they can use.
[1:51:25.240 --> 1:51:32.440]  The goal is to destroy your country, destroy your economy, make your medical facilities
[1:51:32.440 --> 1:51:39.080]  paralyzed, and make you lose your trust to your government, all your civilization,
[1:51:39.080 --> 1:51:44.440]  all your constitution. So we must. Exactly. People ask, well, the globalist is crediting
[1:51:44.440 --> 1:51:49.160]  things, but we blame our own government. They're not perfect, but it's meant to break down society
[1:51:49.160 --> 1:51:54.840]  and create a collapse of confidence, a cloward and pivot move. So people think Otrado is destroying
[1:51:54.840 --> 1:52:00.760]  himself, but he's destroying Canada in the process, which is what these crazy post industrialist
[1:52:00.760 --> 1:52:07.720]  environmental terrorists want. Klaus Schwab has V.I. Lenin in his office, and he's an ultra rich
[1:52:08.440 --> 1:52:15.560]  globalist, but that's what they want. This is a cult. Exactly. Communist, Marxism, and also
[1:52:15.560 --> 1:52:21.720]  whatever name they use, if they want to push humanity, lose your freedom, lose the humanity,
[1:52:21.720 --> 1:52:27.800]  then they are called, they are evil, basically they are anti-Christ. This is not something about
[1:52:27.800 --> 1:52:34.440]  religion. This is something about real faith. And also America is the country based on the
[1:52:34.440 --> 1:52:41.240]  Christians and also the constitution. It guarantees your freedom and also the
[1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:48.600]  minority of this country. So if you give up your freedom of speech, you give up your freedom of
[1:52:48.600 --> 1:52:53.320]  listening and thinking, they will never give it back to you. Well, that's right. So we have,
[1:52:53.320 --> 1:52:59.160]  we have CHICOM, Allied Globalist, Great Reset Forces that are openly in a revolution against
[1:52:59.160 --> 1:53:04.520]  our rights. And so presidents and prime ministers come and go, but the rights that are being trampled,
[1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:09.480]  that's what they care about, is setting the precedent for that. All right, Dr. Lee Mignon,
[1:53:09.480 --> 1:53:17.000]  thank you so much. You're on gab, Dr. Lee Mignon. Any other places people can find you in closing
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:24.600]  comments? Just teachers, they can find me, but be careful of hundreds of big accounts created
[1:53:24.600 --> 1:53:30.920]  by CCP. Only one is the one with over 100,000 followers. Okay, so I'll put that on screen
[1:53:30.920 --> 1:53:37.000]  right here. These are the right ones right there. You can see it, ladies and gentlemen. Is that the
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  right one on screen, Dr. Lee Mignon? I believe it would be. I cannot say it now. Okay. All right,
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:47.560]  thank you so much. We'll talk to you again soon. We appreciate your courage.
[1:53:48.760 --> 1:53:49.720]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:53:49.720 --> 1:53:53.320]  Thank you, Dr. All right, that was an amazing interview. Look, I didn't get to this,
[1:53:53.320 --> 1:53:56.680]  and I got a bunch of breaking news, and there's just too much to cover at all, but I'm going to
[1:53:56.680 --> 1:54:06.280]  try my best. This a recurring fountain of revenue, FDA exec admits Biden planning annual shots,
[1:54:06.280 --> 1:54:10.200]  including toddlers, and admits that the shots are hurting people. I mean,
[1:54:10.200 --> 1:54:16.520]  the full interviews on infowars.com and Zero Edge and Project Veritas,
[1:54:18.040 --> 1:54:22.440]  whatever you do, go to infowars.com and get this article and share it.
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:29.720]  I mean, this is smoking gun of smoking gun stuff, and you just heard that lady on who
[1:54:29.720 --> 1:54:36.440]  100% is for real, and is a top virologist, and was working at one of the top labs in Asia and
[1:54:36.440 --> 1:54:41.640]  saw all this months before it broke in the news. She's like, look, it's a new SARS, a new thing.
[1:54:42.760 --> 1:54:47.080]  It's manmade. Look at it, because they've got the billion-dollar equipment to look at this stuff.
[1:54:49.400 --> 1:54:52.680]  Man, I tell you, it's sick. And then again, hemorrhagic fever is not that big a threat,
[1:54:52.680 --> 1:54:57.800]  she's saying, but it's hysteria now, where every new virus, every new problem,
[1:54:58.360 --> 1:55:01.720]  these companies, including the chai comms, are going to sell you something for,
[1:55:01.720 --> 1:55:07.160]  but it's $10,000 a dose. They're giving us the phobia, they're giving us
[1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:11.160]  the medical hysteria, they're turning us into a bunch of idiots, while telling you,
[1:55:11.160 --> 1:55:17.880]  oh, vitamin C in sunshine and vitamin D and zinc and all this, you don't need that,
[1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:23.080]  you don't need things that are on record working. Oh, that's all horse pace.
[1:55:24.200 --> 1:55:27.400]  You don't want that, you want rendezvous of air that eats your kidneys.
[1:55:27.400 --> 1:55:33.640]  And then we've got this, we're going to talk about this with the next medical
[1:55:33.640 --> 1:55:37.160]  doctor that's joining us. But now, Salazar did a great job last night,
[1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:42.840]  but he ran this headline, two teen boys found dead in bed three and four days after receiving COVID,
[1:55:42.840 --> 1:55:48.680]  does COVID-19 vaccine. Great headline. It's not hardcore enough. It's a Harvard study
[1:55:49.800 --> 1:55:54.600]  looked at a bunch of people that died young boys after they took the shot and concluded
[1:55:54.600 --> 1:55:59.320]  the shot killed them. So that's the headline. I asked him to repost it with the headline,
[1:55:59.320 --> 1:56:03.480]  Harvard study confirms Pfizer COVID injection killing teen boys.
[1:56:05.400 --> 1:56:11.640]  I mean, people think M4 Wars exaggerates. We can't even get it hardcore enough.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  And then I got all these other articles from my God.
[1:56:18.840 --> 1:56:22.360]  We're going to hit it all coming back. Listen, if I don't plug this, we're not going to be here,
[1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:27.800]  and I love you. Plus, we got great products you need. This is the last week because we've already
[1:56:27.800 --> 1:56:31.800]  took this months and months and months, almost five, six months to get it. And we already have
[1:56:31.800 --> 1:56:38.040]  sold out a half of what we got at 50% off X3, the deep growth crystal iodine, and then two other
[1:56:38.040 --> 1:56:42.280]  iodines because some people need the two other iodine to help upload the body. It's a small
[1:56:42.280 --> 1:56:45.800]  minority of folks that can't upload it, but some people like X3 better. It's apples and oranges.
[1:56:45.800 --> 1:56:50.440]  X3 back in stock, 50% off. That sales going to end very, very soon in one week. But what does
[1:56:50.440 --> 1:56:57.560]  end today? The last day of the three-day extension, 25% off on high quality, good, scourable food
[1:56:57.560 --> 1:57:03.400]  that's fresh and in great, hard plastic tote containers with plastic bags inside that are
[1:57:03.400 --> 1:57:06.840]  really high quality, so it stores really well. You can bury this stuff or put it in your attic,
[1:57:06.840 --> 1:57:11.080]  it doesn't matter. Last decades, this is how you beat inflation. It's how you protect yourself.
[1:57:11.080 --> 1:57:14.760]  It's how you get prepared. It's one of the most important things to do, and it funds the M4 War
[1:57:14.760 --> 1:57:21.720]  360 win. It's 25% off. They haven't done that in four years. 25% off. It ends today at infowarstore.com
[1:57:21.720 --> 1:57:27.400]  or prepareallux.com. Prepareallux.com takes you right to the subpage at infowarstore.com,
[1:57:27.400 --> 1:57:34.120]  and then the 25% we make on the food, they don't make their 25. Are you getting that folks? Yeah.
[1:57:35.640 --> 1:57:43.640]  The makers that fund us are selling you food at 25% above cost right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:57:43.640 --> 1:57:45.640]  Can't beat that deal.
[1:58:14.200 --> 1:58:20.120]  Suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and
[1:58:20.120 --> 1:58:27.160]  engineers that are exposing all their lies, their COVID hysteria, their world's gonna end in 2030,
[1:58:27.160 --> 1:58:32.360]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it. And none of it can succeed. None of it can
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:39.080]  actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit. That's why truth comes
[1:58:39.080 --> 1:58:43.400]  with hard work and with research and with diligence, and that's why it's hard to share in Full Wars
[1:58:43.400 --> 1:58:47.160]  links and band-up video links. That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[1:58:55.000 --> 1:59:02.200]  From the words of Chuck Paulinique's Fight Club, dear globalist leaders of the great reset,
[1:59:02.200 --> 1:59:06.840]  the people you're trying to step on, we're everyone you depend on. We're the people who
[1:59:06.840 --> 1:59:12.200]  do your laundry and cook your food and serve your dinner. We make your bed. We guard you while
[1:59:12.200 --> 1:59:18.520]  you're asleep. We drive the ambulances. We direct your call. We are cooks and we are taxi drivers
[1:59:18.520 --> 1:59:24.200]  and we know everything about you. We process your insurance claims and credit card charges.
[1:59:24.200 --> 1:59:28.680]  We control every part of your life. We are the middle children of history,
[1:59:28.680 --> 1:59:34.840]  raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars. But we won't.
[1:59:34.840 --> 1:59:38.840]  And we're just learning this fact. So don't fuck with us.
[1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:44.520]  Support independent media at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:48.680 --> 1:59:54.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:59:54.680 --> 2:00:06.600]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[2:00:06.600 --> 2:00:12.600]  so does he. Live from the infowar.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:12.600 --> 2:00:24.520]  Special counsel John Durham has finally uncovered the horrible truth,
[2:00:24.520 --> 2:00:31.880]  a bombshell crime worthy of the title treason. This is the greatest single political scandal
[2:00:31.880 --> 2:00:38.680]  in American history. This is the greatest single abuse of power that we have ever seen.
[2:00:38.680 --> 2:00:42.360]  Hillary, Laura Collins, Daily Mail, did you pay to spy on the Trump campaign?
[2:00:42.360 --> 2:00:44.680]  What are you going to comment on the spying allegations, Hillary?
[2:00:45.320 --> 2:00:48.920]  Did you pay for the having spied on? Let's define it if we may.
[2:00:48.920 --> 2:00:55.000]  Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, with the approval of Vice President Joe Biden,
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  who was in the room when this was all approved, were involved in the use of the full authority
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:09.080]  of the United States government and the extraordinary capability of our intelligence agencies
[2:01:09.720 --> 2:01:18.520]  to spy on, thus launch an investigation to remove a duly elected President of the United States,
[2:01:18.520 --> 2:01:23.240]  Donald Trump. That is treason. That is treason against the people, against the Republic.
[2:01:23.240 --> 2:01:27.720]  That's about as big a crime as you can commit. The fact that it has been immediately either
[2:01:27.720 --> 2:01:35.320]  ignored entirely or propagandized into oblivion actually reveals the level of fake news masquerading
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:39.240]  as American journalism. If we're hacking here, there should be people going to jail. I think
[2:01:39.240 --> 2:01:43.160]  somebody actually intruded into the White House. Like what the Russians did to Hillary Clinton,
[2:01:43.160 --> 2:01:49.800]  for instance. Right is feasting on this. This makes no sense. This is grist for the mill for Fox
[2:01:49.800 --> 2:01:56.840]  News to go out and further gum up the works to create a whole lot of noise about nothing.
[2:01:56.840 --> 2:02:01.240]  And it's an effort to change the subject from the investigation to January 6th. That's another
[2:02:01.240 --> 2:02:07.400]  element of this story. News about a Durham investigation. Does the President have any
[2:02:07.400 --> 2:02:13.000]  concerns about a candidate for President using computer experts to infiltrate computer systems
[2:02:14.200 --> 2:02:19.400]  of competing candidates or even the President elect to you for the goal of creating a narrative?
[2:02:19.400 --> 2:02:23.880]  Is that something that? That's something I can't speak to from this podium, so I refer you to the
[2:02:23.880 --> 2:02:39.400]  Department of Justice. But will the American people buy it this time? Even though Hillary
[2:02:39.400 --> 2:02:45.560]  Clinton's lackeys are clearly tied to a massive criminal act, putting the citizens of the United
[2:02:45.560 --> 2:02:52.200]  States national security in harm's way after sabotaging the secure servers of the executive
[2:02:52.200 --> 2:02:59.000]  office of a duly elected sitting president of the United States. Democrat-paid operatives
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:05.400]  illegally hacked their political opponents' communications during a presidential campaign
[2:03:05.400 --> 2:03:10.840]  and then did it again to a sitting president. Your reaction to what we learned this morning.
[2:03:10.840 --> 2:03:16.280]  When you look at Durham's pleadings in the Michael Sussman case, you know, he is basically laying
[2:03:16.280 --> 2:03:22.520]  out a case of where a number of laws have been broken by the Clinton campaign and where people
[2:03:22.520 --> 2:03:26.120]  are being protected by Sussman's lawyers. In fact, the pleading is about trying to
[2:03:26.120 --> 2:03:30.120]  convince Michael Sussman and the court that he's not being well served by his own lawyers because
[2:03:30.120 --> 2:03:36.360]  they're in fact protecting the Clinton campaign and others in the allegations of their bias.
[2:03:36.360 --> 2:03:44.920]  Durham has evidence of compromising of computer systems in an attempt to try to basically frame
[2:03:44.920 --> 2:03:49.160]  the president of the United States as having a Russia ties. This is where government is being
[2:03:49.160 --> 2:03:54.440]  used, where information that's political opposition research that is false is trying to be placed into
[2:03:55.160 --> 2:04:00.760]  the government, into the FBI, into to undertake criminal investigations that are absolutely
[2:04:00.760 --> 2:04:06.120]  false. This is a whole new level of corruption and is of grave concern. And it doesn't matter
[2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:10.440]  which side of the aisle this is, everyone should be outraged and everyone should want to get the
[2:04:10.440 --> 2:04:16.200]  bottom of this. But are you going to make sure to get to the bottom of it? Congressman, I've got
[2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:22.600]  to tell you, people are sick and tired of things like this happening with absolutely no accountability.
[2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:28.840]  Why is it that we always need to shift the levers of power in order for criminal politicians and
[2:04:28.840 --> 2:04:35.480]  their families to face prosecution if they face that at all? How long before Democrats literally
[2:04:35.480 --> 2:04:41.320]  get away with the murder of conservatives based on their stranglehold of power? Oh wait.
[2:04:41.320 --> 2:04:46.040]  Prosecutors say they won't charge a police officer who shot and killed a San Diego woman.
[2:04:46.040 --> 2:04:53.400]  John Bowne reporting. Yep, January 6th is about outlawing opposition to this criminal Chycom back
[2:04:53.400 --> 2:05:05.080]  takeover. The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny
[2:05:05.080 --> 2:05:11.960]  lockdowns until the populations rebelled. They would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[2:05:11.960 --> 2:05:18.280]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives. But because of
[2:05:18.280 --> 2:05:23.720]  so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers,
[2:05:24.440 --> 2:05:31.160]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government
[2:05:31.160 --> 2:05:37.000]  corporate takeover. And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever. The problem is some
[2:05:37.000 --> 2:05:42.360]  globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover. Like Canada, they've now
[2:05:42.360 --> 2:05:48.360]  declared a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world are following
[2:05:48.360 --> 2:05:53.720]  suit like Australia. So pray for these folks big time. It's a very serious situation and stay
[2:05:53.720 --> 2:05:57.080]  tuned into infowars.com because truth is absolutely bare amount.
[2:06:02.440 --> 2:06:08.760]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:08.760 --> 2:06:24.520]  Well, we've got one of the hero doctors who for almost two years have been exposing this whole
[2:06:24.520 --> 2:06:29.320]  tyranny for what it is. Dr. Lee Merritt joining us here in just a few minutes. But I wanted to play
[2:06:29.320 --> 2:06:33.800]  a clip of this because this has had millions of views on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, but it's
[2:06:33.800 --> 2:06:40.680]  been taken down. They're now suspending accounts that share it. And they're now not letting people
[2:06:40.680 --> 2:06:48.200]  actually even share the link. We showed you that yesterday, but Dr. Roger Hodkinson is a medical
[2:06:48.200 --> 2:06:53.240]  specialist in pathology, graduate of Cambridge University, and a fellow of the College of
[2:06:53.240 --> 2:06:57.720]  American Pathologist. That's what the coroners are too, that they know what is causing you to get
[2:06:57.720 --> 2:07:03.000]  sick or die. And the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. He's got a long pedigree
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:07.240]  I'm not going to get to it here. The point is we've seen him for over a year and a half speaking
[2:07:07.240 --> 2:07:12.520]  out and he points out you're violating the Nuremberg Code. Doctors that go along with big tech and
[2:07:12.520 --> 2:07:18.040]  big pharma and the media, you are complicit. This is real, folks. This is happening. And
[2:07:18.040 --> 2:07:22.200]  this video is being censored. So I wanted to play this again because they don't want this out.
[2:07:22.200 --> 2:07:27.000]  There's this declaration of them being put on notice by a leading pathologist that again
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:31.560]  figures out what's causing disease and death. That's what pathologists do. Here it is.
[2:07:31.560 --> 2:07:39.640]  The science is settled. There's an overwhelming consensus that nothing worked. Nothing could work,
[2:07:39.640 --> 2:07:45.160]  nothing did work, and nothing will work. That includes the vaccinations which are not just
[2:07:45.160 --> 2:07:52.120]  unnecessary, experimental, untested, and are actually killing people. I want to take this
[2:07:52.120 --> 2:07:57.400]  moment to point a finger directly at the principal cause of why we're all here today.
[2:07:57.400 --> 2:08:05.160]  And it's not the government. No. It's us physicians who have been intimidated by
[2:08:05.160 --> 2:08:12.840]  our colleges, both provincially and internationally. If physicians had not been intimidated by the
[2:08:12.840 --> 2:08:18.520]  very body that's supposed to protect you from me, if they've been allowed to speak their mind
[2:08:18.520 --> 2:08:23.960]  without the threat of losing their income and their positions, then an individual patient,
[2:08:23.960 --> 2:08:28.520]  such as you and me in a closed examining room, would have been told the truth.
[2:08:29.720 --> 2:08:37.160]  The truth. They have been denied that ability to do that. We have had that for centuries.
[2:08:38.040 --> 2:08:41.720]  The two principal medical ethics have been trampled on by this government.
[2:08:41.720 --> 2:08:47.000]  First do no harm and inform consent. First do no harm is being trampled on.
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  Yes. The mandates have killed, as we've heard, more people, many more people than they've
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:59.960]  saved. But inform consent. I will put it to you. How can you give informed consent if you are not
[2:08:59.960 --> 2:09:06.600]  informed? And you have been denied information intentionally by the colleges that are supposed
[2:09:06.600 --> 2:09:12.440]  to protect you. So I say this, putting a point on it. The colleges of physicians and surgeons
[2:09:12.440 --> 2:09:19.800]  across this country and internationally are co-conspirators with government in state-sanctioned
[2:09:19.800 --> 2:09:29.960]  murder. Thank you. Thank you. And the enemies of freedom don't want that video out. Dr. Lee Merritt
[2:09:29.960 --> 2:09:35.160]  is here. I'm going to go over her whole bio, but she began her career at the age of four,
[2:09:35.160 --> 2:09:41.400]  carrying her father's black bag on house calls along the back roads of Iowa in 1980. She graduated
[2:09:41.400 --> 2:09:45.400]  with the University of Rochester, New York, a Rochester School of Medicine, an industry in New
[2:09:45.400 --> 2:09:51.720]  York where she was elected to live membership in the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Society. Dr. Merritt
[2:09:51.720 --> 2:09:57.480]  completed her orthopedic surgery residency in the United States Navy and served nine years
[2:09:57.480 --> 2:10:03.000]  as a Navy physician and surgeon before returning to Rochester, where she was the only woman to be
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:08.360]  appointed as the Lewis A. Goldstein fellow spinal surgery. And the whole bio goes on from there.
[2:10:08.360 --> 2:10:12.600]  I'm not going to read the whole thing. We know what she's done. She's a great lady. And she's been
[2:10:12.600 --> 2:10:17.960]  there day one, warning what's happening. And she wants to get into Ottawa. She wants to get into
[2:10:17.960 --> 2:10:25.160]  the small window of opportunity before BAC's deaths kick in. 5G collaboration of DARPA and MIT, ISN
[2:10:25.160 --> 2:10:32.520]  Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies and more. This is the transhumanist revolution we are
[2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:38.200]  facing, a transhumanist rape of humanity. So Dr. Lee Merritt, thank you so much for joining us.
[2:10:38.200 --> 2:10:43.720]  TheMedicalRebel.com. TheMedicalRebel.com is where they find your great work.
[2:10:43.720 --> 2:10:46.440]  Wow. Where do you want to start? There's so much to cover.
[2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:52.440]  Well, I don't know. There is a lot to cover. And I have to say, of course, all eyes are on Ottawa.
[2:10:52.440 --> 2:10:57.880]  And you know, in spite of us, many of us speaking out from, like you said, really very early,
[2:10:57.880 --> 2:11:02.760]  saying this could be a sterilizing agent. This has got synthetic DNA. You're taking
[2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:07.560]  synthetic DNA or RNA into your body. You know, we said all these bad things, but that didn't get
[2:11:07.560 --> 2:11:13.240]  anybody's attention, really. I mean, compared to what it took truckers in Ottawa to get the world
[2:11:13.240 --> 2:11:18.680]  to really suddenly wake up to the tyranny that's going on here. And you know, God loved the truckers.
[2:11:18.680 --> 2:11:24.600]  But I just, I think it's interesting right now that we're in a situation that's kind of Davos
[2:11:24.600 --> 2:11:32.040]  versus the truckers. And so nobody's going to back down. And that's, that's a, you know,
[2:11:32.040 --> 2:11:38.520]  I, you know, we're going to win when true dough becomes a verb, you know, as in, I think I'm
[2:11:38.520 --> 2:11:42.200]  going to listen to my constituents because I don't want to be true doughed. I think that's
[2:11:42.200 --> 2:11:47.720]  going to be a sign when things start turning around. But we're in a dangerous spot here. And I,
[2:11:47.720 --> 2:11:52.600]  to me, I've been trying to, you know, think this out about situational awareness of where we are.
[2:11:52.600 --> 2:11:59.480]  But the real problem here is we're not out of the devastation that these non vaccines, these are
[2:11:59.480 --> 2:12:04.360]  called viral based genetic therapies, but nobody would take of genetic therapy. So they had to
[2:12:04.360 --> 2:12:09.960]  call them vaccines. You know, we've just started to see the, the death and destruction here, sadly.
[2:12:10.680 --> 2:12:16.040]  So we're in a, we're in a situation where, I mean, let's just think about it. They say now
[2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:24.360]  that 75 to 95% of our military has been vaccinated. You know, all our first responders are medical
[2:12:24.360 --> 2:12:30.600]  people. They're still taking the stupid stuff, even though they can see, you know, videos of
[2:12:30.600 --> 2:12:35.400]  people dropping over. I can't believe anybody is still. Our critical infrastructure has been
[2:12:35.400 --> 2:12:41.720]  strategically taken out. Yeah, I think so. And, and, and it's interesting. You know that they
[2:12:41.720 --> 2:12:45.880]  know what's going on. The people, there are people that know what's going on, but it's all about
[2:12:45.880 --> 2:12:49.880]  optics. Like in Boston, I heard that thought this was kind of funny. And if it weren't so tragic,
[2:12:49.880 --> 2:12:55.960]  you know, you still have to be vaccinated to go to a, a sporting event, but they're not forcing
[2:12:55.960 --> 2:13:01.960]  people to be vaccinated that are the, that are the big athletes, because it's too obvious when
[2:13:01.960 --> 2:13:06.120]  they drop over. So that's right. That's right. I mean, they're not making the Ottawa police or the
[2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:11.560]  federal police taken. Yeah. Yeah. Now, yeah, which makes you wonder who they are. And that's,
[2:13:11.560 --> 2:13:18.360]  that's my point is our, our military is somewhere between 75% and 95% vaccinated. Who knows?
[2:13:18.360 --> 2:13:21.480]  And by the way, I've talked to hundreds of them, including personal friends. They've,
[2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:26.680]  they've had hundreds of shots. They've never been this sick. I talked to medical doctors
[2:13:26.680 --> 2:13:30.920]  in the army, had a green brain here a month ago. He doesn't basically, he said, I've got half my
[2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:37.000]  mind I used to have. He said, it's, it's got brain fog now. Yeah, it's not going away necessarily.
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:39.240]  I mean, I think there are things we can do. I don't want people to be.
[2:13:40.200 --> 2:13:43.320]  One thing is mitigation. You're going to talk about that today, mitigation.
[2:13:44.040 --> 2:13:47.400]  Yeah, I think there are some things we can do to mitigate it. But at the end of the day, you know,
[2:13:47.400 --> 2:13:51.880]  it's, it's a little, it's, it's people have to, you have to realize there's a problem.
[2:13:51.880 --> 2:13:55.880]  I mean, not to, first of all, we should realize somebody in the military should have realized
[2:13:55.880 --> 2:13:59.560]  that Chinese and Russians aren't taking this. Their armies are not taking this stuff.
[2:14:00.120 --> 2:14:04.440]  Oh, even, even Red State had an article last week, I meant to cover like, why is it China or
[2:14:04.440 --> 2:14:12.840]  Russia taking it? Obviously. Yeah. Obviously. I mean, this was a very, they created, and again,
[2:14:12.840 --> 2:14:17.640]  this was created. I said this last time I was there. This was a toxic nanoparticle. It was created
[2:14:17.640 --> 2:14:23.000]  in multiple labs. It was released on the world. Somehow we can argue how that part we don't know
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:28.520]  for sure still, or I don't. But then they ran a very planned and sophisticated psychological
[2:14:28.520 --> 2:14:33.800]  operation on everybody. And they used false testing and classic psychological techniques. So
[2:14:33.800 --> 2:14:38.840]  they got everybody in the world that was glued to a TV. The good news is there are areas in the
[2:14:38.840 --> 2:14:42.760]  world where people don't watch TV so they didn't get the virus. But the people that
[2:14:42.760 --> 2:14:49.560]  were subjected to the PSYOP got scared and they ran out and they did less due diligence
[2:14:49.560 --> 2:14:54.040]  than if they'd been buying a used car and they got these vaccines and they're continuing to get
[2:14:54.040 --> 2:15:01.000]  the vaccines. So you've got a bunch of billions of people around the world that are at risk from
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:05.720]  these things. And they're not really vaccines. We know what they are. The FDA and the pharmaceutical
[2:15:05.720 --> 2:15:09.640]  companies know what they are. They're called viral based genetic therapies. They were designed to be
[2:15:09.640 --> 2:15:15.960]  genetic and cancer therapies. And they do get into your genome. I mean, that's MIT has shown that.
[2:15:15.960 --> 2:15:21.080]  Other people now other researchers have shown that. We're in real trouble and that hasn't stopped.
[2:15:21.080 --> 2:15:27.000]  You know, the British, I think it's the Office of National Statistics has shown that they have,
[2:15:28.040 --> 2:15:33.960]  what is it? They think that there's 5%. I think in any case monthly degradation of people's immune
[2:15:33.960 --> 2:15:37.640]  system. And now what are we hearing? That's right. That's right. Once, what is it? Six months
[2:15:37.640 --> 2:15:41.160]  in and then it just starts going downhill from there. Stay there doctor. We're going to come back
[2:15:41.160 --> 2:15:46.600]  and lay it all out. Small window of opportunity before Vax death kicks in. It's already happening.
[2:15:46.600 --> 2:15:50.840]  Way more deaths last year than the year before. Way more now than the year before as well.
[2:15:50.840 --> 2:15:52.840]  It's exponential. This is horrible. Stay with us.
[2:15:58.360 --> 2:16:05.480]  Something very rare is going on and it ends in just three days as of the time I'm taping
[2:16:05.480 --> 2:16:11.800]  this announcement on Thursday afternoon. Coming up this Monday, the biggest sale in four years
[2:16:12.520 --> 2:16:19.960]  of high quality storeable foods at prepareallocs.com will end. That's 25% off already the lowest
[2:16:19.960 --> 2:16:26.360]  prices you're going to find on high quality storeable food at infowarstore.com. Again,
[2:16:26.360 --> 2:16:33.720]  you can go to prepare with alex.com or infowarstore.com and it takes you to the same place.
[2:16:33.720 --> 2:16:41.880]  50% off as well on super high quality products like X3, the deep earth, there's still high
[2:16:41.880 --> 2:16:47.560]  and high. That sale is going on as well. It doesn't end on Monday. It'll end in a few weeks
[2:16:47.560 --> 2:16:51.080]  and we're all miss sold out of the product. Everybody needs to have horrible food to be
[2:16:51.080 --> 2:16:55.560]  prepared to become self-sufficient now. The best high quality food at the lowest prices
[2:16:55.560 --> 2:17:02.280]  at infowarstore.com. I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:08.120]  I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[2:17:08.120 --> 2:17:13.400]  before they went operational. But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting
[2:17:13.400 --> 2:17:19.480]  caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization
[2:17:19.480 --> 2:17:24.360]  great reset. And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[2:17:24.360 --> 2:17:28.520]  tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear
[2:17:28.520 --> 2:17:32.600]  the truth. So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda,
[2:17:32.600 --> 2:17:36.360]  but we've also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high
[2:17:36.360 --> 2:17:40.680]  quality storeable food. We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices
[2:17:40.680 --> 2:17:46.040]  at infowarstore.com. So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets,
[2:17:46.040 --> 2:17:51.560]  it's ready to ship right now. Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are
[2:17:51.560 --> 2:17:57.240]  long lines and waits. Because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[2:17:57.240 --> 2:18:00.760]  With the world awakening, I think what's important that we were on the momentum right now, take
[2:18:00.760 --> 2:18:04.840]  advantage of this moment. And I've always had an idea that something everybody can do with every
[2:18:04.840 --> 2:18:09.160]  listener can do. I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to, you know, hang the banners
[2:18:09.160 --> 2:18:16.520]  over highways, imagine a champion. It says Alex Jones is right. We stand with the truckers or
[2:18:16.520 --> 2:18:21.640]  rest out or whatever. Brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this. Yes. Now is the time in
[2:18:21.640 --> 2:18:26.520]  your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on your
[2:18:26.520 --> 2:18:32.520]  car or banner hangs over highways. And it will be a chain reaction. What do you recommend people
[2:18:32.520 --> 2:18:37.400]  say on these banner hangs? I have a few ideas. First of all, help just as much as possible to form
[2:18:37.400 --> 2:18:42.120]  a rest out, rest while the vaccine is poison. There's tons of things I say to keep it short,
[2:18:42.120 --> 2:18:47.720]  keep it concise. No, I agree. Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates. The COVID-vaxx is poison. Beautiful.
[2:18:47.720 --> 2:18:51.480]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved if we could all be affected. So that's what I'm
[2:18:51.480 --> 2:18:56.280]  calling about. God bless you, Chris. In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[2:18:56.280 --> 2:19:02.360]  Thank you so much. The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping
[2:19:02.360 --> 2:19:07.560]  stones to leading a healthier life. InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough
[2:19:07.560 --> 2:19:13.400]  in your system with a supplement that contains both. This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus
[2:19:13.400 --> 2:19:18.440]  zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store. The rose hips contained
[2:19:18.440 --> 2:19:24.440]  within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[2:19:24.440 --> 2:19:29.720]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[2:19:29.720 --> 2:19:35.080]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[2:19:35.080 --> 2:19:40.120]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in
[2:19:40.120 --> 2:19:45.320]  nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health. It has been reported that
[2:19:45.320 --> 2:19:50.680]  intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[2:19:50.680 --> 2:19:56.200]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise our rose hips
[2:19:56.200 --> 2:20:26.040]  don't lie. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:26.840 --> 2:20:33.480]  Look at the time we have with Dr. Lee Maron. I'm not going to go back and play clips of her a year
[2:20:33.480 --> 2:20:40.360]  and a half ago saying this is a synthetic lab-made nanotech spike protein of the HIV virus. She said
[2:20:40.360 --> 2:20:46.520]  it's on record. Now it's been confirmed. And just a few weeks ago, we had the head of Pfizer come
[2:20:46.520 --> 2:20:52.760]  out and say, oh, we made the virus in the lab off a scan of the other viruses. So it's beyond
[2:20:52.760 --> 2:20:58.360]  gain of function. Here he is talking about it. What information are you expecting to get over the
[2:20:58.360 --> 2:21:03.640]  next couple weeks, both from within Pfizer and Biontech and also from around the world? We saw
[2:21:03.640 --> 2:21:08.520]  the South Africa data last night. We know that academic labs everywhere are working on this.
[2:21:08.520 --> 2:21:14.520]  How will you make that decision about whether those three doses are enough or if you do need to
[2:21:15.240 --> 2:21:20.040]  switch to that Omicron specific vaccine, which we understand you started working on already and
[2:21:20.040 --> 2:21:27.960]  could have by March? The data that we received are data that we got from what we call pseudovirus.
[2:21:27.960 --> 2:21:34.200]  So it's not the real virus. It is a virus that we have constructed in our labs and it is identical
[2:21:34.200 --> 2:21:39.080]  with the Omicron virus. This is a very well-known study.
[2:21:41.800 --> 2:21:47.080]  So it's their revolution. Just like in 2019, Fauci was on C-SPAN. They said we're going to release
[2:21:47.080 --> 2:21:57.800]  a virus from China, blow up the existing system, bring them an MNRA revolution, and now they've
[2:21:57.800 --> 2:22:06.920]  got OHIV mRNA systems. Dr. Lee Merrick continuing where you left off here about where all of this
[2:22:06.920 --> 2:22:12.920]  is going. Such a historic moment as the world awakens to this, but still the system moves
[2:22:12.920 --> 2:22:17.400]  forward against this. How did you know almost two years ago this was a synthetic virus because
[2:22:17.400 --> 2:22:24.520]  they now admit that? I know and you know they knew it and people in science knew it because
[2:22:24.520 --> 2:22:32.520]  what happened was an article came out and it was published on January 31, 2020 by Prashant Pradhan
[2:22:32.520 --> 2:22:38.760]  and his group in Delhi, India. And what they showed was that in every sequence that was uploaded
[2:22:38.760 --> 2:22:43.960]  to the gene bank from purportedly sick people in China, people that they thought had COVID,
[2:22:43.960 --> 2:22:49.640]  in every one of these sequences in the S1 subunit of the spike protein and keep in mind you don't
[2:22:49.640 --> 2:22:54.760]  need a big 30,000 base pair virus. All you need is this little S1 subunit which is easily
[2:22:54.760 --> 2:23:03.480]  manipulable in a lab. 181 base pairs and within that they found four inserts and those four inserts
[2:23:03.480 --> 2:23:08.200]  were what they call 100% conserved, meaning they didn't vary from specimen to specimen,
[2:23:08.200 --> 2:23:13.800]  whereas the other parts of this thing did. And when they ran those inserts through the BLAST
[2:23:13.800 --> 2:23:18.840]  program, which is a program that we have to look at what to identify genetic sequences,
[2:23:18.840 --> 2:23:24.520]  it showed they came from HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus associated with AIDS.
[2:23:24.520 --> 2:23:30.440]  Now these inserts didn't exist in nature, they weren't in any other specimen of so-called coronavirus,
[2:23:30.440 --> 2:23:34.840]  they weren't in any, they weren't in SARS, they weren't in MERS, this is the first time they showed
[2:23:34.840 --> 2:23:40.760]  up, there were four of them, they didn't vary, I mean you can't make this up. And then I knew it
[2:23:40.760 --> 2:23:46.360]  was correct immediately because on the next day, on February 1st, they were forced to withdraw
[2:23:46.360 --> 2:23:51.560]  the paper. And not only were they forced to withdraw the paper, but I think it was zero
[2:23:51.560 --> 2:23:56.040]  hedge, which is not even a medical journal, economic journal online, they were de-platformed
[2:23:56.040 --> 2:24:03.160]  for reporting on this highly technical genetic article. And I thought what is going on here?
[2:24:03.160 --> 2:24:09.000]  This is now crazy, this is like the military pilot dictum that when you start catching big
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:13.400]  flak, you're over a big, big target, they don't want you to take down. And I realized right then
[2:24:13.400 --> 2:24:17.560]  that's a big target, they don't want to admit this was made in a lab. Of course they don't,
[2:24:17.560 --> 2:24:22.920]  because that makes it a bio weapon. And now I've got all these articles where people are saying
[2:24:22.920 --> 2:24:28.360]  the COVID vaccine, scientists are just turning off the killer T's, I know HIV attacks, the T
[2:24:28.360 --> 2:24:34.520]  Lemposite that programs the killer T's, but it's basically, they're calling it vaccine
[2:24:35.320 --> 2:24:41.640]  AIDS or VADES. Yeah, and you know, I think it's complicated and I don't think it's just from
[2:24:41.640 --> 2:24:47.960]  these inserts. Again, this is a little bit above my pay grade in genetics and immunology and things,
[2:24:47.960 --> 2:24:53.400]  but if you listened to Luke Montagnier, who died sadly this week at age 89, but it was a great
[2:24:53.400 --> 2:25:00.120]  scientist. That was a Nobel Prize winner, he isolated HIV. Right, but not only did he do that,
[2:25:00.120 --> 2:25:07.560]  but he was an honest independent scientist because he had the courage in, I think it was in 1990,
[2:25:07.560 --> 2:25:14.040]  to go to an AIDS meeting in San Francisco and say, you know, guys, I was wrong, HIV by itself
[2:25:14.040 --> 2:25:19.240]  doesn't damage T cells and can't be the cause of AIDS. It might be a cofactor, but there's other
[2:25:19.240 --> 2:25:23.240]  things going on here. So he had the courage to speak out against the narrative. And of course,
[2:25:23.240 --> 2:25:31.240]  the big juggernaut of economics surrounding HIV and the whole Fauci cabal here came crashing
[2:25:31.240 --> 2:25:35.320]  down on his head, but he continued to be an independent scientist. And that's a great point
[2:25:35.320 --> 2:25:41.400]  people forget, Dr, that Fauci was involved in all the weird AIDS stuff and the bad treatments,
[2:25:41.400 --> 2:25:46.600]  just like Rindesivir today, he was pushing AZT and things where the cure was worse than the
[2:25:46.600 --> 2:25:53.000]  disease. It's kind of the same crowd. I mean, it really is the same crowd and the same people
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:58.120]  researching it. You look at people, they're involved in multiple organisms, including now
[2:25:58.120 --> 2:26:04.280]  we're hearing these little, like little drops about Marburg, which we can talk about, but back
[2:26:04.280 --> 2:26:09.400]  to the immune, immune compromise, you know, there are other things that are in here. And of course,
[2:26:09.400 --> 2:26:14.840]  the beauty of an emergency use authorization is you don't have to tell people what's in it.
[2:26:14.840 --> 2:26:19.080]  You don't have to tell people, you know, Albert Burlick can create these things with BioNTech
[2:26:19.080 --> 2:26:23.320]  CEO and they can put this stuff out and they don't have to tell doctors anything. And that's why
[2:26:23.320 --> 2:26:28.200]  the inserts are blank and now they're even leaving them out. But they have to tell you just the part
[2:26:28.760 --> 2:26:34.920]  that is for which they're claiming efficacy. So they claim that this thing is going to produce
[2:26:34.920 --> 2:26:40.600]  the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. And it's going to produce, as they know,
[2:26:40.600 --> 2:26:46.760]  trillions of copies of this. Now, if we see to the notion that this original spike protein was
[2:26:46.760 --> 2:26:52.840]  manipulated in a lab with these inserts and that it's a deadly toxin, they claim, oh, you don't
[2:26:52.840 --> 2:26:56.200]  want to get sick with this, three or four of those things in your nose can kill you. But they've
[2:26:56.200 --> 2:27:00.840]  just produced a vaccine, a so-called vaccine, they're going to inject into your children,
[2:27:00.840 --> 2:27:05.400]  into your six month old, it's going to produce trillions of copies of that spike protein.
[2:27:06.280 --> 2:27:11.720]  That is the bio weapon. They're producing in you. How can we not say that? Okay, so
[2:27:11.720 --> 2:27:17.960]  And it's hidden in you. That's an extremely toxic cancerous thing. Wow.
[2:27:19.720 --> 2:27:25.640]  Right. And the video you just played of the doctor in Canada speaking out, he's exactly right.
[2:27:26.360 --> 2:27:33.880]  This wasn't, this was brought to us by universities. Unfortunately, our establishment medicine,
[2:27:33.880 --> 2:27:38.680]  the highest and brightest guys among us, they had to know. They, you know,
[2:27:38.680 --> 2:27:44.840]  my state university has a patent on the ACE2 pathway and RNA technology around coronavirus.
[2:27:44.840 --> 2:27:49.960]  I mean, a lot of people involved around the world in creating this stuff and in using it,
[2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:56.760]  it's not clear, you know, it's, I mean, well, it's clear that it was manmade and it's being
[2:27:56.760 --> 2:28:01.800]  covered up. And I will just make this historical point. You know, I always used to look at,
[2:28:01.800 --> 2:28:07.800]  and I love my, I loved, I've lived in a university a lot of my life, you know, so I'm not against
[2:28:07.800 --> 2:28:13.320]  the universities, but we have to make this point. The problem there was not brought to you by your,
[2:28:13.320 --> 2:28:19.080]  your local family doctor. Just like in World War II, I used to think Mengele must be the bottom
[2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:23.880]  of his medical school class, you know, some kind of, you know, you know, bottom runner. No, no,
[2:28:23.880 --> 2:28:28.760]  actually he was an MD PhD. He was at the top of his medical school class and he was being funded
[2:28:28.760 --> 2:28:33.960]  by the Kaiser Wilhelm Medical School and medical research arm when he was doing the experiments
[2:28:33.960 --> 2:28:38.440]  at Auschwitz. We need to keep in mind that just cause you have titles behind your name
[2:28:38.440 --> 2:28:43.000]  and you're a big, big guy in your specialty, you're saying the right things, not necessarily
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:46.760]  well said. Dr. Lee Merritt, stay there. We'll come back and talk about this and so much more.
[2:28:46.760 --> 2:28:49.400]  And now we fight back against this trade ad. Stay with us.
[2:28:57.560 --> 2:29:03.640]  Sold out for months. X3 is now back in stock. Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information
[2:29:03.640 --> 2:29:09.480]  is game changing, our products are game changing and so many people are deficient in iodine. It's
[2:29:09.480 --> 2:29:15.240]  not the soil anymore. Most of the ocean is contaminated, but when you get high quality
[2:29:15.240 --> 2:29:21.400]  tri iodine, all three of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your
[2:29:21.400 --> 2:29:28.520]  libido, but most importantly, your immune system. So X3, the only tri iodine on the market, highest
[2:29:28.520 --> 2:29:35.160]  grade is now exclusively available again at 50% off at infowarestore.com. If you've not experienced
[2:29:35.160 --> 2:29:39.400]  clean, pure iodine and what it does for your body takes about two weeks to get on average,
[2:29:39.400 --> 2:29:43.800]  you really need to experience X3. Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're
[2:29:43.800 --> 2:29:48.120]  going to be reordering it, but particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it
[2:29:48.120 --> 2:29:52.040]  because it's amazing what does for your body. It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen,
[2:29:52.040 --> 2:29:58.360]  and it funds the info or a true 360 win. So again, X3 back in stock, 50% off for a limited time,
[2:29:58.360 --> 2:30:02.600]  Mike in California, thanks for calling. I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this
[2:30:02.600 --> 2:30:07.960]  gain of function research. Now, if you read the actual, you know, 2014 legislation, the U.S.
[2:30:07.960 --> 2:30:13.880]  government gain of function, deliberative process and research funding, pause on selected gain of
[2:30:13.880 --> 2:30:18.840]  function research involving influenza, MERS and SARS viruses. There's nothing about SARS-like
[2:30:18.840 --> 2:30:23.880]  viruses and if the research funding paused, it's not a stop, it's not a prohibition. It's when
[2:30:23.880 --> 2:30:27.800]  you come to a four-way intersection, there's the stop sign, you stop, you look both ways,
[2:30:27.800 --> 2:30:32.600]  and then you proceed. And so it's also, it doesn't pause all gain of function, just selected
[2:30:32.600 --> 2:30:36.520]  gain of function, but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and
[2:30:36.520 --> 2:30:40.840]  qualification research. So, you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right,
[2:30:40.840 --> 2:30:43.800]  they don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function. You know,
[2:30:43.800 --> 2:30:46.840]  that's why he didn't perjure himself. That's why he hasn't been arrested.
[2:30:46.840 --> 2:30:51.080]  Because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do,
[2:30:51.080 --> 2:30:55.400]  but in the main definition, it's still a gain of function. They're making something deadly that
[2:30:55.400 --> 2:31:01.320]  spreads more easily to hurt people. Thank you, Mike. We love you. Something very rare is going on
[2:31:01.880 --> 2:31:09.480]  and it ends in just three days, as of the time I'm taping this announcement on Thursday afternoon.
[2:31:09.480 --> 2:31:15.320]  Coming up this Monday, the biggest sale in four years of high-quality, storeable foods
[2:31:15.320 --> 2:31:22.040]  at preparalix.com will end. That's 25% off already the lowest prices you're going to find
[2:31:22.040 --> 2:31:30.040]  on high-quality, storeable food at infowarstore.com. Again, you can go to preparewithalex.com
[2:31:30.040 --> 2:31:39.000]  or infowarstore.com and it takes you to the same place. 50% off as well on super high-quality
[2:31:39.000 --> 2:31:46.200]  products like X3, the deep earth, there's still iodine. That sale is going on as well. It doesn't
[2:31:46.200 --> 2:31:50.840]  end on Monday, it'll end in a few weeks, and we're almost sold out of the product. Everybody needs
[2:31:50.840 --> 2:31:55.320]  to have storeable food and be prepared to become self-sufficient now. The best high-quality food
[2:31:55.320 --> 2:32:03.160]  at the lowest prices at infowarstore.com. The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience,
[2:32:03.880 --> 2:32:10.600]  a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the
[2:32:10.600 --> 2:32:17.960]  global private corporations has put in place. It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from
[2:32:17.960 --> 2:32:23.560]  which we will never emerge. It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover
[2:32:23.560 --> 2:32:32.280]  our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun. It is the symbol of our complete and total
[2:32:32.280 --> 2:32:39.080]  absolute surrender to evil. Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[2:32:40.120 --> 2:32:45.240]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us. Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out
[2:32:45.240 --> 2:32:50.920]  with implantable microchips as part of the World ID and carbon taxes. Things only get worse from
[2:32:50.920 --> 2:32:56.920]  here if we submit. They only get better if we resist and say no. Non-compliance, non-compliance,
[2:32:56.920 --> 2:33:04.840]  non-compliance. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:04.840 --> 2:33:13.480]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:13.480 --> 2:33:23.240]  Obviously, I don't say this to impress people. I don't say it to build up our status in the
[2:33:23.240 --> 2:33:27.960]  world. I say it because it's the truth and I want victory against this evil. Info Wars is one of
[2:33:27.960 --> 2:33:32.600]  the most important organizations. Our listening audience of activists are the most important
[2:33:32.600 --> 2:33:41.480]  people in the world. We are facing a new type of war, a scientific war against humanity.
[2:33:42.440 --> 2:33:46.280]  But the great news is it's been the doctors and the scientists and the researchers that have been
[2:33:46.280 --> 2:33:53.400]  the front line of exposing that. Dr. Lee Merritt, Medical Doctor Sir Weathers, she's been there
[2:33:53.400 --> 2:33:58.680]  from the very beginning, a warning of what was coming and been dead on. I appreciate her joining
[2:33:58.680 --> 2:34:06.120]  us. You can find her. Great information at TheMedicalRebel.com. I want you to get into
[2:34:06.120 --> 2:34:12.440]  the small window of opportunity before Vax's deaths kick in. Then 5G, which in the studies we
[2:34:12.440 --> 2:34:19.560]  know creates COVID-like symptoms. And the collaboration of DARPA and MIT and the ISN Institute for
[2:34:19.560 --> 2:34:27.400]  Soldier Nanotechnologies. Please lay that out for us, Dr. Lee Merritt. I wasn't joking when I said
[2:34:27.400 --> 2:34:33.480]  this is Davos versus the trucker. So the people running this show, it's not just about the virus
[2:34:33.480 --> 2:34:41.960]  or the COVID takedown. These guys also figured that they had the airwaves with theirs and they
[2:34:43.080 --> 2:34:47.400]  could control the hospitals. We've seen that, which is shocking to most of us in medicine,
[2:34:47.400 --> 2:34:53.480]  how well they've been able to do that to commit this democide, basically. And they've put their
[2:34:53.480 --> 2:34:58.120]  leaders in positions of power. I mean, look at Trudeau. He's like the turtle on the post that
[2:34:58.120 --> 2:35:03.000]  nobody knows how he got there. Well, he got there through the WEF. So he's one of those global,
[2:35:04.120 --> 2:35:10.280]  they're a bunch of them, Macron, Bojo, they've all trained with the WEF. So this has been going
[2:35:10.280 --> 2:35:14.840]  on in the background for a long period of time. But what they didn't count on the fact is they
[2:35:14.840 --> 2:35:20.120]  don't, right now, they don't control the ability for people to transport goods and services. It's
[2:35:20.120 --> 2:35:25.800]  the truckers and the people on the ground actually doing things. The problem here is we're getting
[2:35:25.800 --> 2:35:32.840]  word now from Australia that they feel they were directed energy weapons used against the crowd in
[2:35:32.840 --> 2:35:42.360]  Canberra. Now, that's a whole other level of evil, this 5G ability. And this is not just sci-fi.
[2:35:42.360 --> 2:35:49.000]  Anybody that wants to go, this is why I bring up the nanotechnology area at DARPA. You can't read
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:54.280]  about this 5G on DARPA anymore, although you could at the outbreak of COVID. Interesting. They've
[2:35:54.280 --> 2:36:02.680]  scrubbed it. But 5G was created as a denial of access weapon. It was used for crowd control.
[2:36:02.680 --> 2:36:09.320]  It was created to, it interacts, it picked the right frequency and the right power,
[2:36:09.320 --> 2:36:14.760]  and it resonates with helical structures. So it can fragment your DNA, but it can also interact
[2:36:14.760 --> 2:36:19.880]  with your hair follicles. And that's what they used it for. We used it. Our military has used this
[2:36:19.880 --> 2:36:25.080]  in like Baghdad, Green Zone, I think, and some places around the world to get people out of the
[2:36:25.080 --> 2:36:29.320]  crowd. And what happens is you turn it on, it resonates with your hair follicle. It makes you
[2:36:29.320 --> 2:36:35.960]  feel like your whole skin's on fire. Now, I don't, I'm not saying it was that particular technology,
[2:36:35.960 --> 2:36:39.560]  but something- No, but you're right. I mean, I remember stuff 20 years ago, DARPA working on
[2:36:39.560 --> 2:36:46.600]  using shell towers for crowd control. I mean, this is real stuff. This is real stuff. And now,
[2:36:47.480 --> 2:36:56.040]  what do we have? In my little town, 1,400 people. We have now the new 5G lamp posts all over. I just
[2:36:56.040 --> 2:37:02.040]  noticed them. I have one outside my bedroom window, essentially. This is full spectrum dominance.
[2:37:02.040 --> 2:37:07.480]  They're just, it's everywhere. Yeah. And so I've heard, and I heard years ago, I thought she was
[2:37:07.480 --> 2:37:13.480]  a little crazy at the time, but I heard years ago about it was, it's a physics PhD person that
[2:37:13.480 --> 2:37:19.880]  worked at CERN. And she was saying, when these things get into place, it will be like having an
[2:37:19.880 --> 2:37:24.840]  AK-47 on every tree and then forest on every lamp post in the CERN.
[2:37:24.840 --> 2:37:26.920]  That goes, they can resonate them however they want.
[2:37:27.880 --> 2:37:34.840]  Yep. Yeah, they can, because they can tune this. I mean, yes, it can be used harmlessly or reasonably
[2:37:34.840 --> 2:37:41.400]  harmlessly, but not completely. And keep in mind, we're electrical beings. There's a lot of history
[2:37:41.400 --> 2:37:45.080]  here about this. By the way, there have been engineers in the UK, and I checked with engineers.
[2:37:45.080 --> 2:37:49.480]  They looked at 5G. They put those points on them where they can energize them and use them as
[2:37:49.480 --> 2:37:53.960]  particle beams, and no one even knows that. And just fry drivers as they go down the street.
[2:37:54.920 --> 2:38:02.760]  Right. They're targetable. And the other thing is, just on a more lesser obvious level,
[2:38:02.760 --> 2:38:10.760]  electromagnetic frequencies can create symptoms that are completely identical to what we call COVID.
[2:38:10.760 --> 2:38:17.320]  They can cause lung inflammation, brain fog, look at the Havana syndrome. They can do all sorts
[2:38:17.320 --> 2:38:21.080]  of things. So is that why we see it in the more dense areas like New York and places?
[2:38:21.080 --> 2:38:27.800]  Because you're right. The CIS are worried about Havana syndrome. Well, okay. If you look at it,
[2:38:27.800 --> 2:38:34.440]  people are seeing this all over the place. Right. I think it's happening. And I don't take care of
[2:38:34.440 --> 2:38:40.280]  a ton of people anymore, but when I was still treating people for COVID and myself included,
[2:38:40.280 --> 2:38:46.520]  I can tell you this. One of the things that seems to be a symptom of people that are more
[2:38:46.520 --> 2:38:51.240]  sensitive to electromagnetic frequencies, when they have a problem, they get pink urine. It has
[2:38:51.240 --> 2:38:56.520]  to do with the biochemistry of your porphyrin, how you make hemoglobin. And just like some people
[2:38:56.520 --> 2:39:02.040]  have an enzyme system that isn't robust and they can get gout, other people have an enzyme system
[2:39:02.040 --> 2:39:07.480]  that apparently isn't robust. It has to do with your building of hemoglobin and it's more sensitive
[2:39:07.480 --> 2:39:12.760]  to damage from EMF. So for whatever that means, I started seeing people that had, first of all,
[2:39:12.760 --> 2:39:17.000]  they'd already had what looked like COVID. And now they're getting sick again in the city,
[2:39:18.280 --> 2:39:21.960]  coincident with 5G being turned on in their neighborhood and they're having
[2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:26.760]  this little joke that we're holding a microwave device up to our head frying ourselves.
[2:39:27.800 --> 2:39:33.560]  Right. They can joke about it all they want, but this, the same disinformation about this
[2:39:33.560 --> 2:39:39.560]  is the disinformation about cigarettes. How, oh, there's no evidence that cigarettes cause lung
[2:39:39.560 --> 2:39:45.240]  cancer. There's no evidence. They told us for decades that that was all just coincidental.
[2:39:45.240 --> 2:39:49.480]  There's a lot of coincidental disease about this thing too. It's just all coincidental.
[2:39:49.480 --> 2:39:53.720]  Cigarettes aren't connected to cancer though they knew and suppressed it. I remember five years ago
[2:39:53.720 --> 2:39:59.320]  Wired Magazine had a big report with studies, 5G causes cancer, but suddenly all that cut off,
[2:39:59.320 --> 2:40:05.000]  no reporting on it. Right. That's exactly right. And I, there is a great video online
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:11.640]  by Dr. Devra, me saying this now, it'll probably get cut down, but Dr. Devra was a, an EPA physician,
[2:40:11.640 --> 2:40:17.480]  maybe the chief medical physician for the EPA at one time, but she actually had a great lecture to
[2:40:17.480 --> 2:40:23.800]  the combined departments of engineering and medicine in, in New Zealand or Australia. And
[2:40:23.800 --> 2:40:28.920]  you can still find it on the internet. It's worth looking at because she debunks, she shows how
[2:40:28.920 --> 2:40:34.360]  that the, the same disinformation about cigarettes and about secondary smoke and about various
[2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:40.200]  different things are involved with this. And we see this, you know, it's, we see this over and over.
[2:40:40.200 --> 2:40:45.000]  I mean, you can, people thought we were crazy. We're in about fluoride and I have a lot of
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:49.240]  family history around the science of fluoride. I'm telling you, it's not crazy to worry about
[2:40:49.240 --> 2:40:54.360]  fluoride. There are lots of these things and there's a common theme. They damage your immune system
[2:40:54.360 --> 2:41:01.160]  and they damage your neurologic system. So even Harvard has studies looking at 25 studies a decade
[2:41:01.160 --> 2:41:07.720]  ago that it lowers IQ, lowers fertility, lowers sperm counts, plunging. I mean, we're seriously
[2:41:07.720 --> 2:41:13.800]  sick. There's no doubting that. Right. Right. And it's getting, you know, we're getting for the
[2:41:13.800 --> 2:41:18.440]  first time, even before this all broke out for the first time, we had had a decrease in our life
[2:41:18.440 --> 2:41:22.200]  expectancy in America. You know, it had been increasing and increasing and increasing and
[2:41:22.200 --> 2:41:27.400]  then it decreased. And that's, that's not a small point because it means that we, we're being faced
[2:41:27.400 --> 2:41:33.480]  with a lot of things hitting us and toxins are a big one. I'm doing a talk on this coming up.
[2:41:33.480 --> 2:41:40.280]  It's on, on fluoride. And, you know, it's a big one. Bromide is a big one. It's interesting that
[2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:45.880]  after World War II, a lot of this started, you know, the pharmaceutical, IG Farben was the biggest
[2:41:45.880 --> 2:41:53.080]  pharmaceutical company chemical conglomerate in the world prior to World War II. Their CEO helped
[2:41:53.080 --> 2:41:59.320]  fund Hitler. And after World War II, during Project Paperclip, a bunch of those chemists came over
[2:41:59.320 --> 2:42:05.640]  here. You know, I'm not, you know, you make that what you will, but subsequently things have happened
[2:42:05.640 --> 2:42:11.560]  such as we used to stabilize our wheat, our flour for breaking bread. We used to stabilize it with
[2:42:11.560 --> 2:42:16.200]  iodine, which is a good halogen. That's a good halide. But what do we stabilize it with, with
[2:42:16.200 --> 2:42:22.120]  it now? Bromine. Bromine is toxic. It's toxic to your brain. It's, you know, we, we call, there's
[2:42:22.120 --> 2:42:27.800]  disease called bromism. It's like depression and psychiatric problems. And it's toxic to your
[2:42:27.800 --> 2:42:33.800]  thyroid. It makes you, you know, it, it can give you congenital abnormalities due to thyroid.
[2:42:33.800 --> 2:42:39.320]  So they're poisoning the water, they're poisoning the bread, everything. All right, Dr. Lee Merritt
[2:42:39.320 --> 2:42:45.480]  is on fire. Final segment with her straight ahead. Is it too late to turn this back? We'll talk to her
[2:42:45.480 --> 2:42:51.320]  about this folks. This is life and death information. Find her website at themedicalrebel.com. We'll
[2:42:51.320 --> 2:43:02.520]  be right back. Sold out for months. X3 is now back in stock. Ladies and gentlemen, just like our

[2:45:02.360 --> 2:45:07.720]  with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations,
[2:45:07.720 --> 2:45:13.800]  big tech government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go
[2:45:13.800 --> 2:45:19.240]  and what you do. So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[2:45:19.240 --> 2:45:23.560]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts,
[2:45:23.560 --> 2:45:28.360]  protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount. That's why

[2:45:53.000 --> 2:46:07.240]  From the words of Chuck Paul and the Fight Club,
[2:46:08.440 --> 2:46:14.040]  dear globalist leaders of the great reset, the people you're trying to step on,
[2:46:14.040 --> 2:46:19.000]  we're everyone you depend on. We're the people who do your laundry and cook your food and serve
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:25.240]  your dinner. We make your bed. We guard you while you're asleep. We drive the ambulances. We direct
[2:46:25.240 --> 2:46:31.240]  your call. We are cooks and we are taxi drivers and we know everything about you. We process your
[2:46:31.240 --> 2:46:36.600]  insurance claims and credit card charges. We control every part of your life. We are the
[2:46:36.600 --> 2:46:42.040]  midchildren of history raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires
[2:46:42.040 --> 2:46:51.160]  and movie stars, but we won't and we're just learning this fact. So don't with us support
[2:46:51.160 --> 2:46:54.120]  independent media and infowarstore.com.
[2:46:54.120 --> 2:47:11.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:33.560]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones. So this is just a short little two
[2:47:33.560 --> 2:47:40.360]  minute compilation of all these people having seizures, collapsing, some cases dying after
[2:47:40.360 --> 2:47:46.280]  they take these shots. Again, the establishment doesn't want to see that's why they're censoring
[2:47:46.280 --> 2:47:51.880]  everything. And this whole attack as bad as it is is a test in my mind for my research of what's
[2:47:51.880 --> 2:47:55.400]  coming next. I'll see what Dr. Merritt thinks about that statement first. Here it is.
[2:48:02.760 --> 2:48:04.600]  We should force inject people on that sheet.
[2:48:06.040 --> 2:48:06.600]  Does this?
[2:48:06.600 --> 2:48:20.760]  The military police was called in the rural area of Ribeirão-vermelho. You know why?
[2:48:23.560 --> 2:48:30.600]  I don't mean to brag, I don't care, but I want you to know double-vaxxed booster, flu shot,
[2:48:30.600 --> 2:48:38.360]  and I'm going to be honest, I have the shingle shot too. Never got COVID clearly.
[2:48:39.160 --> 2:48:44.680]  Jesus loves me the most. Seriously. So nice, so nice.
[2:48:52.680 --> 2:48:57.240]  I don't care if you're Donald Trump, I don't care if you're Bill Gates, I don't care who you are.
[2:48:57.240 --> 2:49:01.560]  You come at children with experimental Nuremberg code violating vaccines
[2:49:01.560 --> 2:49:06.920]  that you broke the law to ram through, you are terrorist in league with Joseph Mengele 2.0.
[2:49:09.320 --> 2:49:13.560]  We have a player down on the court will try to get more information.
[2:49:13.560 --> 2:49:18.440]  Johnson taken out on a stretcher and rushed to local Tallahassee Memorial Hospital.
[2:49:18.440 --> 2:49:23.800]  Leading cardiologist says cluster of collapses and footballers likely to be just a coincidence,
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:27.880]  a terrible coincidence at that, but just a coincidence. Yes, just a coincidence.
[2:49:34.200 --> 2:49:38.920]  You really need to get vaccinated, get vaccinated. Listen to our government agencies,
[2:49:38.920 --> 2:49:44.280]  these guys are telling the truth. You know, there's no conspiracy here folks, just get your damn vaccine.
[2:49:44.280 --> 2:49:53.880]  Dr. Lee Merritt, in the 10 minutes we have or nine minutes we have in closing,
[2:49:55.480 --> 2:50:00.280]  is there a way to stop this closing window of opportunity to stop the vaccine death kicking
[2:50:00.280 --> 2:50:05.960]  in and where does all this go because I've got a Harvard study out here where they're admitting
[2:50:05.960 --> 2:50:09.640]  that it's causing little boys to have heart attacks and die when they take the shot. I mean,
[2:50:09.640 --> 2:50:15.800]  this is just insane. Yeah, well, I know and and they're actually putting in medication now into
[2:50:15.800 --> 2:50:21.400]  the children's vaccine that helps to stop them from having. Yeah, how crazy is they put an anti
[2:50:21.400 --> 2:50:26.600]  heart attack drug because it's emergency. No one has to approve it. So, oh, we don't put saline
[2:50:26.600 --> 2:50:32.840]  solution. We put a heart attack drug in and it's exactly it's crazy. And they and they've got programs
[2:50:32.840 --> 2:50:37.640]  that make it sound like it's normal that yes, children die of heart attacks too. This it's
[2:50:37.640 --> 2:50:42.360]  hard to watch those videos. It's sad. And people, you know, when that when that comedian fell,
[2:50:42.360 --> 2:50:46.600]  they thought that she was just making this up. It was part of the joke. No, she fractured her
[2:50:46.600 --> 2:50:51.400]  skull. And if you watch her and you watch these other people, they're having a sudden neurologic
[2:50:51.400 --> 2:50:55.800]  insult. I mean, they their eyes become unfocused and they can't speak. Suddenly, they lose their
[2:50:55.800 --> 2:51:00.520]  speech and then they fall. So it's not made up. This is for real. So yeah, can we get out of it?
[2:51:00.520 --> 2:51:04.040]  Can we get out of this? Well, we better do it right now. That's what I'm saying. I think there's
[2:51:04.040 --> 2:51:09.000]  a closing window of opportunity. And we can't let the truckers lose. That's number one, because if
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:13.560]  the truckers lose, it sends a signal to the big boys that are running this show that all they have
[2:51:13.560 --> 2:51:21.880]  to do is just wait us out. You know, we're past that. I think you can deny the you can deny reality,
[2:51:21.880 --> 2:51:25.800]  but you can't deny the consequences of reality like these people have done, you know, they
[2:51:26.840 --> 2:51:30.600]  people even some people even have to having vaccinated their child and having the child
[2:51:30.600 --> 2:51:34.360]  having a side effect still say, yeah, but I still believe it. And I'm going to my other
[2:51:34.360 --> 2:51:39.240]  children vaccinated because they've been so brainwashed by this idea is, oh, this is just a
[2:51:39.240 --> 2:51:44.680]  few people. It's not just a few people. And that's why I think that big study that came out of the
[2:51:44.680 --> 2:51:51.080]  insurance company out of Indiana and the ONS that shows all cause mortality up in 2021, the year of
[2:51:51.080 --> 2:51:58.920]  the vaccine by 42% that we've never seen before. That's like a 13 Sigma event. It's not normal.
[2:51:58.920 --> 2:52:04.120]  So something really bad was my next question. This even ended up on Fox Fox called and confirmed
[2:52:04.120 --> 2:52:10.600]  a consortium of major insurance companies 100 billion under management and now Yale and Harvard
[2:52:10.600 --> 2:52:18.360]  and Princeton, they're all confirming 40 plus percent death increase in 18 to 64 the working age.
[2:52:18.360 --> 2:52:24.600]  That wasn't that big in World War Two. This is the biggest in US history. I mean, you can't hide
[2:52:24.600 --> 2:52:30.280]  real numbers like that. You know, when Michael Eden said they're trying to kill billions of us and I
[2:52:30.280 --> 2:52:35.720]  said, this is an extinction level event. We weren't exaggerating. This is a potential really
[2:52:36.440 --> 2:52:41.560]  world. Even if we get out of it with just those people injured, it's a it's a world changing
[2:52:41.560 --> 2:52:45.800]  life changing event we're experiencing. But so what do people need to do? Well, again,
[2:52:45.800 --> 2:52:50.520]  the people that have been vaccinated need to recognize the problem and do something to help
[2:52:50.520 --> 2:52:54.200]  themselves. We can't help people that don't want to help themselves, but there are some things we
[2:52:54.200 --> 2:52:59.560]  can do. I recommend, you know, I've got a whole thing on my website about vaccine remorse. Here's
[2:52:59.560 --> 2:53:06.360]  some things we think can help. Another thing I think we need to do is that every time one person
[2:53:06.360 --> 2:53:11.000]  speaks up, it encourages somebody else to speak up. They want us to think, yeah, I love that, by the
[2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:15.800]  way, I persuaded this Jim Jones, I persuaded over 900 people to drink my Kool-Aid. And how's
[2:53:15.800 --> 2:53:20.760]  she saying amateur? I get these sent these memes. And so I put a favorite one up every week. It's
[2:53:20.760 --> 2:53:26.200]  sadly true that that's what's going on. Every time somebody speaks up, they encourage somebody else.
[2:53:26.200 --> 2:53:30.280]  They want us to think we're all separated, but there are a lot of us speaking out. And
[2:53:31.400 --> 2:53:36.360]  what did we also learn just now from Ottawa? You these guys control a lot of things. Don't
[2:53:36.360 --> 2:53:42.280]  give up your cash. These are part of your readiness. You're even medical ready. Oh, exactly. The whole
[2:53:42.280 --> 2:53:47.240]  rollout is about a world ID getting rid of cash. They control a social credit score. They admit it.
[2:53:47.240 --> 2:53:51.640]  This is a planetary takeover. And if we recognize it as that, we can beat it. We're designed to
[2:53:51.640 --> 2:53:55.400]  win wars. But we have to, as you said earlier at the start of the show, start of the hour,
[2:53:55.400 --> 2:53:58.280]  we have to admit we're under attack. We have to admit we're in a war.
[2:53:59.400 --> 2:54:03.640]  That's exactly right. Think about who dies early on in the wars, the people with lack of
[2:54:03.640 --> 2:54:08.120]  situational awareness. You know, people in Sarajevo that the war broke out over their heads
[2:54:08.120 --> 2:54:12.840]  overnight. They went from being a first class world class city. They went to get up in the morning,
[2:54:12.840 --> 2:54:17.400]  thought they were going to the place to get a little cappuccino, and then they got hit by a
[2:54:17.400 --> 2:54:22.600]  stray round. I mean, you can't be ignorant now of what's going on. We need to take action.
[2:54:22.600 --> 2:54:28.120]  And I think the next step is everybody that's cooperating with the enemy needs to stop.
[2:54:28.840 --> 2:54:34.760]  If you are, if you're working for Merck or you're working for Pfizer, think about where you are.
[2:54:34.760 --> 2:54:41.320]  If you're a doctor or a nurse and you're pushing these vaccines, these non-vaccines, these genetic
[2:54:41.320 --> 2:54:46.520]  agents, quit doing it. Because let me tell you, this, when this comes down, we're not going to
[2:54:46.520 --> 2:54:50.440]  give up. And when this comes down and people realize how many of their family members have
[2:54:50.440 --> 2:54:55.480]  been killed or maimed by this program, they're not going to look, they're already looking
[2:54:55.480 --> 2:55:00.040]  a scant at the hospital. So let me just be honest, they're not looking favorably at hospitals.
[2:55:00.600 --> 2:55:05.400]  And you don't want to be there. Doctor, I totally agree with you. We're not looking for war,
[2:55:05.400 --> 2:55:10.520]  but we, we, we have been really just trying to warn people in a position to try to stop this.
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:15.240]  But once civilization breaks down, there'll be no way they're going to stop the millions of
[2:55:15.240 --> 2:55:19.640]  people who lost their daughters and sons and mothers and fathers. I mean, the globalist,
[2:55:19.640 --> 2:55:23.400]  I think they know now, though, they wanted to do this by stealth. They thought it would work.
[2:55:23.400 --> 2:55:28.840]  They miscalculated, like you said an hour ago. I mean, is there any way to give the globalists
[2:55:28.840 --> 2:55:34.680]  an armistice or to give them a, like Napoleon goes to Alba? Is there a way to reach out to them and
[2:55:34.680 --> 2:55:39.160]  say, stop, because the weaker they get them, more they double down. I don't want to kill them.
[2:55:39.160 --> 2:55:42.920]  I don't want a conflict. I want them to stop, but it just doesn't seem like they can.
[2:55:44.040 --> 2:55:49.800]  It doesn't seem like they can. But we can stop again. Eichmann didn't run Auschwitz. He just
[2:55:49.800 --> 2:55:54.200]  designed the train system. If there weren't people doing the little jobs that made it run,
[2:55:54.200 --> 2:55:56.920]  it wouldn't run. We have to stop the machine that's bringing us here.
[2:55:56.920 --> 2:56:00.680]  I totally agree. We've got to reach out to all the bureaucrats, the police, the military,
[2:56:00.680 --> 2:56:03.560]  and say, do not look fools, do not be part of this.
[2:56:04.680 --> 2:56:08.840]  Right. I'd really, you know, that's what I, having spent 10 years in the military,
[2:56:08.840 --> 2:56:15.000]  I have, and my life in medicine, I am just absolutely shocked at what's going on. I mean,
[2:56:15.640 --> 2:56:20.440]  I think our military leaders have been captured. They're not thinking about this in a military
[2:56:20.440 --> 2:56:23.640]  way. And that's their job is, you know, to think about bio weapons, to think about
[2:56:24.440 --> 2:56:28.440]  unrestricted, uncharacteristic warfare. And they're obviously compromised. They're
[2:56:28.440 --> 2:56:33.640]  compromised. They're obviously compromised. But the people that are the, you know, the mid-level
[2:56:33.640 --> 2:56:39.080]  field grade officers, the enlisted guys, the guys that do the job. Come on, guys, wake up,
[2:56:39.080 --> 2:56:44.120]  do not participate in this. Policemen. Really? You know, you saw some of these policemen in Ottawa
[2:56:44.120 --> 2:56:48.360]  and in Australia, especially, I couldn't believe what they were doing to their own people.
[2:56:48.360 --> 2:56:53.960]  Don't they realize it's, they're coming after your children too. This, we, we really have to
[2:56:53.960 --> 2:56:56.920]  stop them cooperating. And I think that's where this goes next.
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:57:02.120]  But you agree, doc, that overall it's not going like the globalists want it as negative as things
[2:57:02.120 --> 2:57:07.080]  are. It seems like it's falling apart for the system. Well, I think they wanted to have this
[2:57:07.080 --> 2:57:11.640]  be deadly, but they wanted a slow bio weapon, a slow kill bio weapon. And too many people
[2:57:11.640 --> 2:57:16.520]  dropped over in the acute phase and it made them look bad. And now they're scrambling. It's become,
[2:57:16.520 --> 2:57:19.960]  it's like the assassin. You don't want the guy to drop over right in front of you. You want to be
[2:57:19.960 --> 2:57:22.840]  two blocks away when he's on the floor. I agree. Stay there two minutes to five more minutes,
[2:57:22.840 --> 2:57:26.520]  whether it's Dr. Lee Merritt, straight ahead. We'll give you her website. Everybody should visit
[2:57:26.520 --> 2:57:30.200]  and share it, ladies and gentlemen. It's a revolutionary act to share this URL,
[2:57:30.200 --> 2:57:35.800]  themedicalrebel.com, themedicalrebel.com. Don't forget, band.video. Well, that's band to share.
[2:57:35.800 --> 2:57:41.240]  So now it's freeworldnews.tv. Oh, that's band. So now you share futurenews.news. Oh,
[2:57:41.240 --> 2:58:01.400]  that's band. How about redpilled.news? The globalist social engineers always intended to push
[2:58:01.400 --> 2:58:14.760]  law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their laws. Now their whole project
[2:58:14.760 --> 2:58:21.160]  is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[2:58:21.720 --> 2:58:26.840]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever. The problem is some globalist controlled
[2:58:26.840 --> 2:58:33.320]  areas are not going to give up on their takeover like Canada. They've now declared a civil emergency
[2:58:33.320 --> 2:58:38.520]  in martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[2:58:38.520 --> 2:58:44.360]  So pray for these folks big time. It's a very serious situation. Stay tuned into infowars.com
[2:58:44.360 --> 2:58:49.480]  because truth is absolutely paramount with all the craziness going on in the world.
[2:58:50.040 --> 2:58:55.000]  But the globalist plotted their next big lockdown for the next phase of the great reset
[2:58:55.000 --> 2:59:00.200]  being a state cyber attack with the deep state pushing a civil war not just here
[2:59:00.920 --> 2:59:06.680]  but in Europe and war with Russia with the massive inflation and all the other garbage
[2:59:06.680 --> 2:59:12.120]  that's taking place like supply chain right now. You need to get prepared now with high quality
[2:59:12.120 --> 2:59:18.600]  storeable food that is ready to ship. And it's been four years since my patriot supply at
[2:59:18.600 --> 2:59:26.600]  preparewithalex.com has offered their storeable food at 25 percent off four years. But right now
[2:59:26.600 --> 2:59:32.840]  it's 25 percent off until February 13th 2022 a little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting
[2:59:32.840 --> 2:59:40.280]  this to get 25 percent off at preparewithalex.com on the entire catalog of my patriot supply.
[2:59:40.280 --> 2:59:49.880]  Act now get prepared now. This is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self sufficient.
[2:59:49.880 --> 3:00:01.880]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance.
[3:00:01.880 --> 3:00:16.280]  I've been on air 28 years and I grew up by God's grace knowing about what was happening in the
[3:00:16.280 --> 3:00:22.440]  world and I wish this wasn't true. But we're giving everybody a jump start on what's happened.
[3:00:25.560 --> 3:00:30.680]  Believe me I wish this wasn't true. But depopulation of the planet is now taking place
[3:00:30.680 --> 3:00:36.680]  and if you conservatively look at what's happened it's going to be devastating. I've had a family
[3:00:36.680 --> 3:00:41.160]  that's rebelled just because I'm Alex Jones and gone out and got the shots that are now deathly
[3:00:41.160 --> 3:00:47.400]  ill. They look like shadows of the former selves. It's painful. But you know what and
[3:00:47.400 --> 3:00:53.800]  everybody makes it and my family is not just my family my family is all of you. So I can save some
[3:00:53.800 --> 3:00:59.480]  black person in Africa or some Hispanic person in Mexico or some white person in Poland. I don't
[3:00:59.480 --> 3:01:04.040]  care at the end. This is about doing the right thing in front of God. We got Dr. Lee Merritt
[3:01:04.040 --> 3:01:11.400]  here, medical doctor, great patriot exposing all this. ThemedicalRebel.com. How do we beat this?
[3:01:11.400 --> 3:01:15.960]  Other angles? Other things you're seeing? Where do you see this fight going in close?
[3:01:17.560 --> 3:01:24.600]  Well ultimately we have to take back our world in multiple areas and it's mostly local. But there
[3:01:24.600 --> 3:01:30.120]  are a couple things I think that we need to realize how this came about. They used my profession
[3:01:30.120 --> 3:01:35.800]  which I love medicine and science to bring this about because they knew that it was it was hard
[3:01:35.800 --> 3:01:43.080]  for people to get their head around it. We have let the propaganda machine tell us year after year
[3:01:43.080 --> 3:01:48.280]  just take your vaccines we know what we're doing and it's been safe and effective blah blah blah
[3:01:48.280 --> 3:01:51.320]  and we've been doing it for years. We've been standing in line and people have been getting
[3:01:51.320 --> 3:01:56.600]  their flu shots. They were set up for this okay but the only way we and science means knowledge
[3:01:56.600 --> 3:02:03.560]  but keep in mind science can also mean there it's a way of of hiding knowledge. But like you said
[3:02:03.560 --> 3:02:10.200]  with Jim Jones it's Kool-Aid most of the time and then finally it's cyanide. Right exactly so
[3:02:10.200 --> 3:02:17.000]  we have to take back our ability to talk to each other to take back the language to to be know
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:22.520]  whom you know people don't know who to associate with for truth because they've been lied to for
[3:02:22.520 --> 3:02:27.880]  so long and you guys in the independent media and you particularly for years have been fighting
[3:02:27.880 --> 3:02:34.120]  to keep this alive and that's now maybe we need you to help us do medical shows and things where
[3:02:34.120 --> 3:02:38.440]  doctors can share information because that is one of the things that allowed this to happen.
[3:02:38.440 --> 3:02:45.080]  Centralization of medical learning under a few guidelines we have the Politburo theory of science
[3:02:45.080 --> 3:02:50.520]  now where you can't just publish something that's a that's your your ideas based on what you saw
[3:02:50.520 --> 3:02:54.920]  and let other people decide whether it's true or not we have a few people at the top that decide
[3:02:54.920 --> 3:02:58.920]  before it even is published whether it's true and then whether it can be out there or not that's
[3:02:58.920 --> 3:03:05.960]  the problem we we don't have good medical and scientific transparency it's completely corrupt
[3:03:05.960 --> 3:03:11.720]  how we do how we do publishing for science that's number one and so we have to take that back
[3:03:11.720 --> 3:03:16.200]  we can't we can't you know as physicians and scientists you can't let them redefine our
[3:03:16.200 --> 3:03:21.000]  language like cases you know we can't do that cases were always sick people now suddenly it's
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:25.960]  a positive test that is also what allowed this to do it's a lot of little things but we need
[3:03:25.960 --> 3:03:31.960]  everybody standing up the problem here is people were not they just didn't believe they did not
[3:03:31.960 --> 3:03:36.120]  believe they're being under attack I think a lot of people still don't and until we get them to
[3:03:36.120 --> 3:03:43.240]  believe we can't take it back but I I that's why that the Ottawa truckers and the people that the
[3:03:43.240 --> 3:03:49.560]  USA convoy now it's so obvious that there's we're not alone and I think the more we do that the
[3:03:49.560 --> 3:03:55.160]  more we support these guys um but I'm not joking we need it we need an info wars for medicine
[3:03:55.160 --> 3:03:59.960]  and science maybe no I mean I totally agree doc and the way you started the interview an hour
[3:03:59.960 --> 3:04:04.120]  ago is where you ended it's about grassroots action it's about awakening and it's about
[3:04:04.120 --> 3:04:08.840]  realizing we are under attack so we've got this great infrastructure info wars I'm trying to
[3:04:08.840 --> 3:04:14.200]  hammer people to run live shows I agree maybe you should host uh or help us you have a seven
[3:04:14.200 --> 3:04:19.080]  nights a week an hour of doctors uncensored saying what they want to say to the American people that
[3:04:19.080 --> 3:04:23.880]  is a genius idea doctor thank you dr. Lee Merritt people can find your great work at the medical
[3:04:23.880 --> 3:04:28.440]  rebel dot com and by the way the way weird fate works you haven't been on in three four months
[3:04:29.080 --> 3:04:33.720]  and you're about to be on with a guest host Kate dally coming up in about 25 minutes so
[3:04:33.720 --> 3:04:38.840]  that's how synergy and serendipity works and fate works thank you so much doc hey thank you
[3:04:39.560 --> 3:04:43.480]  amazing lady and man if she been on target you know that's what we have on is the people that

[3:06:07.080 --> 3:06:11.960]  dr marit in the house today she has important messages and i'm really happy to bring her on
[3:06:11.960 --> 3:06:18.440]  with me right after this segment but i am so glad to be here today and i have something to say today
[3:06:18.440 --> 3:06:25.240]  that probably is not going to merit me a lot of popularity um i want to start off saying that
[3:06:25.240 --> 3:06:30.600]  i have enjoyed watching the freedom games going on in ottawa much more than the beijing games
[3:06:30.600 --> 3:06:34.840]  and it's not to diss the athletes i'm sure they worked very very hard i think people
[3:06:34.840 --> 3:06:39.960]  are so exhausted about what's been going on in this country and all around the world that the
[3:06:39.960 --> 3:06:44.760]  games are something that's kind of an afterthought for a lot of people i know i haven't even hardly
[3:06:44.760 --> 3:06:50.760]  tuned in at all but here's the thing that i want to point out about ottawa that most people aren't
[3:06:50.760 --> 3:06:56.200]  going to do this men will not publicly recognize what i'm about to say because they won't they
[3:06:56.200 --> 3:07:03.320]  won't do this for themselves and women won't offer this observation up anytime soon and i just want
[3:07:03.320 --> 3:07:10.120]  to recognize the fact that who is saving our liberty right now who's in the fight who's really
[3:07:10.120 --> 3:07:15.720]  trying out there and making the most difference in the united states it's firefighters police
[3:07:15.720 --> 3:07:24.120]  it's pilots standing together male dominated careers in canada it's truckers truckers are 90
[3:07:24.120 --> 3:07:30.840]  percent male women won't acknowledge this we've been trained to think of this in sort of a you
[3:07:30.840 --> 3:07:37.160]  know women power uh the media is doing everything they can do to make sure that you think that all
[3:07:37.160 --> 3:07:42.360]  women are saving the world all the time and yada yada yada and i think it's bogus i think it's the
[3:07:42.360 --> 3:07:48.680]  most ridiculous storyline narrative that we have when it comes to the heavy heavy heavy
[3:07:48.680 --> 3:07:53.480]  lifting and i'm not saying women aren't wonderful because they are and they are making huge differences
[3:07:53.480 --> 3:07:59.960]  look at the women doctors look at the people speaking out but as hollywood and media want you
[3:07:59.960 --> 3:08:05.160]  to think it's a small group of you know liberal women and some lesbians let's face it um saving
[3:08:05.160 --> 3:08:11.160]  the world in every single movie everything fostering that girl power mantra it's many
[3:08:11.160 --> 3:08:16.040]  wonderful husbands and fathers out there that are not backing down and that are them making the most
[3:08:16.040 --> 3:08:22.440]  productive changes may and and sticking in the fight and making sure that justin trudeau castrow
[3:08:22.440 --> 3:08:27.880]  is uh is on his heels uh running from this and looking like the dictator that he is kind of
[3:08:27.880 --> 3:08:33.480]  glad that's happening actually women are in the fight too but it's groups of men banding together
[3:08:33.480 --> 3:08:39.640]  hardworking middle class male dominated careers that are saying no for the rest of the world right
[3:08:39.640 --> 3:08:44.440]  now this is so much more exciting to me than the olympics but i want to give credit where credit is
[3:08:44.440 --> 3:08:51.400]  due because it's so rarely given especially right now in our society as we stand right now
[3:08:51.400 --> 3:08:56.840]  our young boys need to know this our young boys need to hear this message and so to the men out
[3:08:56.840 --> 3:09:01.960]  there caring about their families and don't want to be a guinea pig in this uh very very dangerous
[3:09:01.960 --> 3:09:11.240]  series of shots we may not win this war in the long run i get it but the fight is going on and the
[3:09:11.240 --> 3:09:18.040]  fight is the story that will be told and when we tell the story of blovid we need to give credit
[3:09:18.040 --> 3:09:23.720]  where credit is due and i know that if a man brings this up he'll be villainized for it so i'm
[3:09:23.720 --> 3:09:30.280]  gonna do it but i thank you for all that you're doing to help everyone's liberty and it's going
[3:09:30.280 --> 3:09:35.960]  largely unnoticed by a lot of people because they're afraid to say it but i thank the men out there
[3:09:35.960 --> 3:09:43.080]  for standing up i also want to say that Justin Trudeau Castro needs to just come keep on being
[3:09:43.080 --> 3:09:48.520]  himself because you know what he is scaring his own supporters and it's wonderful to see and just
[3:09:48.520 --> 3:09:54.600]  like you know they have it uh in uh reported car accidents now um you know where they acknowledge
[3:09:54.600 --> 3:09:59.160]  whether or not somebody was wearing a seatbelt whether it mattered or not i want in every single
[3:09:59.160 --> 3:10:04.520]  death notice in every single death article i want some sort of acknowledgement about whether they
[3:10:04.520 --> 3:10:10.520]  took the shots or not it's only fair right i mean as far as the seatbelt goes they always have to
[3:10:10.520 --> 3:10:15.720]  acknowledge that ever since they started forcing and compelling us to wear seatbelts well i want
[3:10:15.720 --> 3:10:19.960]  to make sure that people are recognized when they take all of the shots and what happens to them i
[3:10:19.960 --> 3:10:27.000]  think it's fair don't you anyway i also wanted to mention this uh next week i'll be talking about
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:31.720]  the reproductive problems with the shots and i'm going to have on a fantastic doctor to talk about
[3:10:31.720 --> 3:10:39.400]  that with me hopefully and i also wanted to mention that the sterilization that went on that one
[3:10:39.400 --> 3:10:45.960]  certain doctor founded he founded it in a series of shots the shots had to be a series it couldn't
[3:10:45.960 --> 3:10:52.600]  just be one shot one shot was about contraception but it had to be a series of shots that actually
[3:10:52.600 --> 3:10:58.680]  performed complete sterilization that was irreversible this is really important to know because that
[3:10:58.680 --> 3:11:05.640]  doctor died mysteriously two years ago so i'll be talking about that next week and i also wanted to
[3:11:05.640 --> 3:11:11.320]  give you a little bit of an update before i bring dr miradon i had christopher folton the author on
[3:11:11.320 --> 3:11:16.040]  for the book the inheritance and the reason i was telling you to get this book is that it was so
[3:11:16.040 --> 3:11:23.880]  fascinating in peeling back some layers of the story of kennedy's uh a massacre of his assassination
[3:11:24.440 --> 3:11:30.840]  in in areas that we might not think are something to even look at i look at marylyn minroe and the
[3:11:30.840 --> 3:11:34.760]  reason i brought her up we didn't go into a lot of detail in that hour with christopher folton
[3:11:34.760 --> 3:11:40.280]  but this is really important to know she came out of nowhere norma gene baker she really wasn't
[3:11:40.280 --> 3:11:44.600]  that much to look at she really wasn't noticeable on the side of the street you wouldn't have stopped
[3:11:44.600 --> 3:11:51.640]  a car even honked a car for for norma gene baker but in a time when the cia was actively producing
[3:11:51.640 --> 3:11:58.360]  mk ultra and all obviously uh you know producing a lot of people in the media and in hollywood
[3:11:58.360 --> 3:12:04.520]  that would penetrate uh not only the media cbs and hollywood and everywhere else we came up with
[3:12:04.520 --> 3:12:10.760]  marylyn minroe she was created in the book the inheritance christopher folton the author who
[3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:17.320]  spent time in prison because he has the oval office tapes and a watch that was very very crucial
[3:12:17.320 --> 3:12:21.960]  that the cia wanted the reason that his book was important is it peeled back some layers of
[3:12:21.960 --> 3:12:28.520]  marylyn minroe was she a mule for information between russia and the united states was she used
[3:12:29.080 --> 3:12:33.720]  and you know we tend to think of her as the you know sexual dynamo and of course that's all
[3:12:33.720 --> 3:12:38.920]  kennedy wanted from her but you know when you are dealing with the star of the day and you're a
[3:12:38.920 --> 3:12:44.440]  president of the united states kind of interesting that he would pick her somebody that's very very
[3:12:44.440 --> 3:12:51.160]  visible right well i just wanted to kind of share the the little notion that maybe she was a lot more
[3:12:51.960 --> 3:12:58.760]  to the cia than just a you know little sex kitten for jfk maybe there was a lot more to that story
[3:12:58.760 --> 3:13:04.840]  in that she was engineered in that she was somebody that produced information and i would suspect
[3:13:04.840 --> 3:13:09.400]  that several of the women coming in and out of the white house that we all thought were just affairs
[3:13:09.400 --> 3:13:15.720]  were also mules for information that book brought up kind of a layer that i hadn't even considered
[3:13:15.720 --> 3:13:21.080]  or thought about before and i wanted to share that with you because when we're lied to boy they do
[3:13:21.080 --> 3:13:27.560]  it good they lie to us on every single corner about every single thing and in my 10 years of radio
[3:13:27.560 --> 3:13:33.960]  let me just tell you the one thing i have found is don't trust anything question everything because
[3:13:33.960 --> 3:13:40.520]  when you look at at maryland munroe obviously she was knocked off for a reason and was that reason
[3:13:40.520 --> 3:13:46.120]  because she was a deliverer of that information between russia and the united states very interesting
[3:13:46.120 --> 3:13:52.200]  theory also the watch that he was wearing did you know that linden johnson secret service and his
[3:13:52.200 --> 3:13:57.480]  own secret service stripped him of all the jewelry he had on him right before he was to get in the
[3:13:57.480 --> 3:14:03.960]  limousine they said it was to test for nuclear activity but the problem was was they never gave
[3:14:03.960 --> 3:14:08.440]  anything back to him they didn't want him wearing any jewelry because they didn't want any remnants
[3:14:08.440 --> 3:14:14.200]  of those bullets hitting the jewelry and staying in the jewelry while on their way to the car actually
[3:14:14.200 --> 3:14:19.240]  are in the hotel room i think right before they got into the car jackie presented him with a watch
[3:14:19.240 --> 3:14:24.520]  that she had gotten out of a service it was being serviced was an anniversary gift and you can tell
[3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:30.040]  in the photos that he's wearing this particular watch that watch had certain bullet fragments
[3:14:30.040 --> 3:14:36.040]  certain fragments that they didn't want to leak out because on the information that is because it
[3:14:36.040 --> 3:14:43.000]  would tell the tale of who actually killed kennedy those fragments those mercury fragments located in
[3:14:43.000 --> 3:14:47.800]  that watch the piece of evidence that they wanted so bad from christopher fulton and threw him in
[3:14:47.800 --> 3:14:54.680]  prison for uh almost a decade it was really important to the story of jfk we must know how
[3:14:54.680 --> 3:15:01.320]  they do things we have to to look beyond the story and catch every single item of that story and
[3:15:01.320 --> 3:15:05.960]  question it because i think that if you want to know how they're doing this today and their little
[3:15:05.960 --> 3:15:09.800]  game plan and what they're doing there's a lot of things we can study there's a lot of things we
[3:15:09.800 --> 3:15:14.920]  can learn from but the things that i want to be able to learn from are how they tell the lies
[3:15:14.920 --> 3:15:21.640]  and what they do to interject the narrative and also sell us on the lies and the inheritance book
[3:15:21.640 --> 3:15:26.040]  is great for that so i highly recommend it i'm going to come back on with dr lee merit we're
[3:15:26.040 --> 3:15:31.560]  going to be talking about shedding specifically and the new hiv narrative that seems to dominate the
[3:15:31.560 --> 3:15:37.800]  headlines because i want to know why there's always a reason why are they injecting at hiv eights
[3:15:38.600 --> 3:15:44.120]  yes we'll uh talk to dr merit about that but i will be right back of course with the awesome
[3:15:44.120 --> 3:15:49.080]  dr lee merit who helped me so much in my own personal situation what a wonderful front line
[3:15:49.080 --> 3:15:52.520]  doctor she is i'll be right back i'm k dally your guest house
[3:15:58.200 --> 3:16:03.880]  get our great bag of it here i mean this is from people say why is it from chiapas mexico
[3:16:03.880 --> 3:16:09.080]  the communist well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above
[3:16:09.080 --> 3:16:14.280]  organic in the volcanic soil better than guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers
[3:16:14.280 --> 3:16:17.640]  that you know the media calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever the
[3:16:17.640 --> 3:16:21.720]  point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the mexican government
[3:16:21.720 --> 3:16:25.560]  take over so i actually buy this from the mexican rebels and i've been buying it for what 14 years
[3:16:25.560 --> 3:16:29.240]  and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at whole foods under another name for about

[3:21:20.280 --> 3:21:25.480]  shedding and about what the vaccinated are doing to the unvaccinated because i keep my email boxes
[3:21:25.480 --> 3:21:30.920]  literally blowing up with people wanting to know hey i'm spending a lot of time around vaccinated
[3:21:30.920 --> 3:21:37.080]  family and i'm getting sick all the time i would love to hear you out on this subject and i'm so
[3:21:37.080 --> 3:21:41.080]  sorry if you covered this with alex because i did not listen to that hour so i apologize
[3:21:41.080 --> 3:21:46.600]  it's i and i know and i think the two things that um that i always think about because you and i
[3:21:46.600 --> 3:21:52.840]  started this whole conversation on shedding years ago and your utah show and uh and we also talked
[3:21:52.840 --> 3:21:57.480]  about um what to do like we had we talked about your husband when he was in the hospital about
[3:21:57.480 --> 3:22:02.280]  what to do to try and save him from the clutches of the hospital boy that's becoming a big issue
[3:22:02.280 --> 3:22:06.920]  and i think that's something we could talk about but yeah the whole thing about shedding first of all
[3:22:06.920 --> 3:22:11.800]  it's not that we don't know something about this they hid from us for a long time but we were able
[3:22:11.800 --> 3:22:17.160]  to unearth stuff there was a there is a european medical association meeting in 2008 where they
[3:22:17.160 --> 3:22:22.760]  talked about this it's a long time ago because these are this is a problem that they recognized
[3:22:22.760 --> 3:22:29.000]  the vaccine researchers and the fda and the european medical association recognized that was
[3:22:29.000 --> 3:22:34.360]  happening to people in these test in these test programs for these genetic agents and they were
[3:22:34.360 --> 3:22:38.280]  and they were they this is how we know the real name of these they're not vaccines they're viral
[3:22:38.280 --> 3:22:45.080]  based genetic therapies or vb gts that's what they call them so they um they know about this
[3:22:45.640 --> 3:22:49.480]  and they didn't tell us when we started having all these they're still not telling us right when
[3:22:49.480 --> 3:22:52.680]  we're still having all these questions we still have questions but we've learned some things
[3:22:53.240 --> 3:22:59.240]  so there's no question that they knew that shedding existed uh the issue is they don't know what's
[3:22:59.240 --> 3:23:04.200]  coming off people isn't that isn't that wonderful would they just put this on the billions of people
[3:23:04.200 --> 3:23:10.120]  and they can't tell us really what people are shedding they said well could be viral could be
[3:23:10.120 --> 3:23:15.240]  genetic or it could be some recombination that's really really comforting to me i i assume it is
[3:23:15.240 --> 3:23:21.960]  to you too so so but they do say it usually is in a 10 week window usually because the problem
[3:23:21.960 --> 3:23:27.000]  here is is if you're if you're elderly or not and it's not really about age it's about your immune
[3:23:27.000 --> 3:23:31.720]  system if your immune system is not functioning very well you can become chronically infected
[3:23:31.720 --> 3:23:37.240]  and chronically shed these things now that's part of it they believe that it comes off in
[3:23:37.240 --> 3:23:43.000]  two waves and they say that from the way they want you to study this is again this wasn't written
[3:23:43.000 --> 3:23:47.320]  to doctors or treating people this was written to their own pharmaceutical researchers and what
[3:23:47.320 --> 3:23:51.640]  they tell you is if you're going to be using this kind of you're going to be doing these studies
[3:23:51.640 --> 3:23:58.040]  here's how you test people for shedding that starting on day one and you know for every day
[3:23:58.040 --> 3:24:02.440]  for a week or 10 days and then after that they want you to test these people weekly until they
[3:24:02.440 --> 3:24:07.080]  have three weeks where they don't shed okay and the testing does not appear to have anything to do
[3:24:07.080 --> 3:24:11.720]  with your breathing you're not shedding this stuff by breathing on people so don't people shouldn't
[3:24:11.720 --> 3:24:17.080]  be afraid to go to the grocery store that's not how you get shed upon upon it's being in close
[3:24:17.080 --> 3:24:24.760]  contact with people so I know multiple cases now where somebody is in a group of people
[3:24:26.520 --> 3:24:32.760]  or they have family and they get shed upon and then that whole group or their family come down
[3:24:32.760 --> 3:24:38.680]  with classic COVID classic symptoms of what we consider COVID which is you know you know
[3:24:40.200 --> 3:24:44.600]  cough shortness of breath sometimes hospitalization
[3:24:44.600 --> 3:24:55.560]  fever night apparently yeah yeah so so it clearly transmits not only to the person being shed upon
[3:24:55.560 --> 3:25:02.440]  but some other person and and and I will tell you so if you the ugly part about this if you
[3:25:02.440 --> 3:25:07.720]  go back this is this is the the the piece of information that when I was on a podcast over
[3:25:07.720 --> 3:25:12.360]  a year ago and and Robert Malone was on that podcast with me you could tell he didn't want me
[3:25:12.360 --> 3:25:18.840]  talking about and it was a it was a it was a it was a piece of research done in Australia called
[3:25:19.640 --> 3:25:24.120]  self-disseminating vaccines for emerging infectious diseases and essentially what they
[3:25:24.120 --> 3:25:28.120]  did is they wanted to get rid of apparently it's kind of funny you know I don't I don't know that
[3:25:28.120 --> 3:25:32.600]  we have this in the Midwest in America but in I'm talking to people in Australia this is true
[3:25:32.600 --> 3:25:37.080]  they have these outbreaks of mice and these mice will just suddenly your whole barn will be filled
[3:25:37.080 --> 3:25:41.960]  with mice so they wanted they claim that they're worried about some disease breaking out hasn't
[3:25:41.960 --> 3:25:45.160]  but they worry about so they want to get rid of some of these mice well how they're going to do it
[3:25:45.160 --> 3:25:49.080]  they can't shoot them they can't trap enough you know they have to do something so they came up with
[3:25:49.080 --> 3:25:55.720]  these self-disseminating immunogenic contraceptives so you you inject the mice you get you get enough
[3:25:55.720 --> 3:26:00.600]  you trap enough mice and you vaccinate them with this stuff and if you look at the way the stuff
[3:26:00.600 --> 3:26:06.600]  is made it's made like the J&J vaccine it's a DNA vaccine made with a replicant deficient virus
[3:26:06.600 --> 3:26:10.760]  I mean I'm going the technicalities of this but it doesn't matter it's like the J&J vaccine
[3:26:10.760 --> 3:26:16.920]  and they they vaccinated a group of these mice it sterilizes the female mice by damaging their ovaries
[3:26:16.920 --> 3:26:22.120]  but then these mice go out and they run around and they are apparently very gregarious animals
[3:26:22.120 --> 3:26:26.760]  you see them in all these big clusters and so they rub up against all these other mice and now
[3:26:26.760 --> 3:26:32.760]  they become sterile and then they go out and rub up even against a bigger group of mice which
[3:26:32.760 --> 3:26:38.280]  becomes sterile and then it kind of fizzles out in the population and I think that's what we're
[3:26:38.280 --> 3:26:44.280]  seeing I hate to say it I think that's what we're seeing now you know because what in addition to
[3:26:44.280 --> 3:26:49.640]  just not feeling good what are we really seeing women my friend Christiane Northrop and keep in
[3:26:49.640 --> 3:26:54.600]  mind I'm an orthopedic surgeon so this isn't my field but Christiane Northrop is a world famous
[3:26:54.600 --> 3:26:59.960]  OBGYN doctor and she's told me she says we are seeing all these women and I've had people complain
[3:26:59.960 --> 3:27:05.560]  to me about that women that are having menstrual irregularities suddenly suddenly they were normally
[3:27:05.560 --> 3:27:10.440]  normal for 10 15 years of their reproductive life and then suddenly they're having two periods a
[3:27:10.440 --> 3:27:14.440]  month or three periods or unrestrained bleeding or they sloughed the inside of their uterus and
[3:27:14.440 --> 3:27:19.240]  then we're having elderly women that are postmenopausal well I shouldn't say elderly I'll put myself
[3:27:19.240 --> 3:27:25.160]  in that category that then start bleeding and then we have people who are no small thing right
[3:27:25.160 --> 3:27:29.240]  Dr. Merritt I mean they're trying to shove this in myocarditis off as something that's just oh it
[3:27:29.240 --> 3:27:36.280]  happens no big deal this is not a small thing this is huge because guess what they're also
[3:27:36.280 --> 3:27:41.320]  having little girls down to age two start to bleed now what Christiane Northrop says is when you see
[3:27:41.320 --> 3:27:46.280]  this kind of behavior you're seeing damage to a woman's reproductive system something now I'm not
[3:27:46.280 --> 3:27:51.960]  saying it's irreversible but you're seeing something happening that's not good it's not good so what's
[3:27:51.960 --> 3:27:57.960]  happening here and here's the here is the potential worst case scenario but we they can't rule it out
[3:27:57.960 --> 3:28:03.720]  and that's the problem when you when you voice something no matter I don't think their intentions
[3:28:03.720 --> 3:28:09.880]  were good let's back up I don't think the CEO of Pfizer and and BioNTech and Moderna all got
[3:28:09.880 --> 3:28:14.440]  together and say you know we really need to help the world with this no I think they they for five
[3:28:14.440 --> 3:28:18.760]  years or ten years and said I think we got a way of getting people to take our product we'll get
[3:28:18.760 --> 3:28:22.520]  the government to force them to take our product we'll scare the heck out of them you know so I
[3:28:22.520 --> 3:28:26.840]  don't think this is done but let's suppose just for a minute even forgetting that the the motive
[3:28:26.840 --> 3:28:32.840]  you know if you should not voice people to take something when you haven't really worked out the
[3:28:32.840 --> 3:28:38.440]  details and there's a most of the details have not been worked out we're going to come right back
[3:28:38.440 --> 3:28:43.080]  more with Dr. Lee Merritt we'll talk a little bit more about the HIV why is this popping up in the
[3:28:43.080 --> 3:28:47.320]  news all the time we'll talk about shedding and also in the paperwork that Pfizer released there
[3:28:47.320 --> 3:28:51.160]  was something very interesting called occupational transference we'll come back we'll talk about
[3:28:51.160 --> 3:28:58.520]  that too I'll be right back Kate Dally your guest host with Dr. Lee

[3:32:24.120 --> 3:32:30.120]  people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all
[3:32:30.120 --> 3:32:36.760]  their lies their covetous area their world's gonna end in 2030 carbon tax global warming bull all of
[3:32:36.760 --> 3:32:42.840]  it and none of it can succeed none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[3:32:42.840 --> 3:32:48.680]  silenced and gas lit that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence
[3:32:48.680 --> 3:32:53.400]  that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and band of video links that's why we've got to
[3:32:53.400 --> 3:33:02.120]  share them now more than ever leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's
[3:33:02.120 --> 3:33:15.880]  alex jones maybe i didn't reach you hi i'm kate dally your guest host from the kate dally show
[3:33:15.880 --> 3:33:21.800]  kate dally radio dot com i go live right after this every day three hours a day and uh i welcome
[3:33:21.800 --> 3:33:27.640]  you back i have dr lee merit with me and let me just say this uh in the documentation that
[3:33:27.640 --> 3:33:32.920]  fizer uh is forced to release now because they wanted to wait 75 years yeah and there's nothing
[3:33:32.920 --> 3:33:39.880]  creepy about that um but uh trust the science uh but in that documentation it said occupational
[3:33:39.880 --> 3:33:45.880]  transference i think it was section 8.3 if i'm if i'm not mistaken dr merit and it was occupational
[3:33:45.880 --> 3:33:51.000]  transference they were very very worried about what the spike protein would do and how it could
[3:33:51.000 --> 3:33:56.680]  shed on the people in your household um and that it could be done through touch it could be done
[3:33:56.680 --> 3:34:00.440]  through saliva and they were going to keep tabs on this of course they never did they never did
[3:34:00.440 --> 3:34:04.200]  keep tabs on this they're not keeping tabs on anything because they don't want the truth to come
[3:34:04.200 --> 3:34:08.600]  out so when they say safe and effective it means they looked at it for about five seconds and went
[3:34:08.600 --> 3:34:13.560]  it's safe and effective uh and so this shot this occupational transference it's not like
[3:34:13.560 --> 3:34:17.720]  fizer didn't actually admit that there was going to be a problem with shedding there was going to
[3:34:17.720 --> 3:34:24.200]  be a problem from the vaccinated to the unvaccinated in this right right right and you should look at
[3:34:24.200 --> 3:34:28.760]  again that that article that they sent to their researchers who did they whom did they think they
[3:34:28.760 --> 3:34:34.840]  should protect it was neonates the elderly and the immune compromised whom did they push these
[3:34:34.840 --> 3:34:41.880]  vaccines on this is not an accident they're pushing it on our children and these and the elderly and
[3:34:41.880 --> 3:34:47.480]  immune compromised they told us it was safe and pregnant women and what did we find out when the
[3:34:47.480 --> 3:34:52.760]  actual data came out even though and and by the way they tried to hide it in the actual data by
[3:34:52.760 --> 3:34:57.080]  misinterpreting the data by this is what they do they change the definition like in the hospitals
[3:34:57.080 --> 3:35:01.480]  right now you're not vaccinated if you've had two vaccines and are 13 days out of the second
[3:35:01.480 --> 3:35:05.960]  vaccine you're considered unvaccinated so by changing their definition you could change the
[3:35:05.960 --> 3:35:13.320]  outcomes in these papers and what they've done is they they tried to change things so that it just
[3:35:13.320 --> 3:35:19.400]  didn't show up like it was a problem of the how we define miscarriage okay and i'm not an objn doctor
[3:35:19.400 --> 3:35:24.360]  but i can tell you my friends who are experts in this said they claimed it was a 19 percent fetal
[3:35:24.360 --> 3:35:29.880]  loss or something like that in the first trimester and it turned out to be 83 to 87 percent so it's
[3:35:29.880 --> 3:35:35.480]  four times the fetal loss in the first trimester to vaccinated mothers and we're seeing infertility
[3:35:35.480 --> 3:35:41.320]  and we're seeing all sorts of things that go along with what we saw with this bleeding and this
[3:35:41.320 --> 3:35:46.200]  abnormal problems that we're seeing and it's down to children so think about how horrible this can be
[3:35:47.000 --> 3:35:52.840]  this is not you cannot say this is by accident it's a crime against humanity uh wolf wolfgang
[3:35:52.840 --> 3:35:58.520]  wardog and dr yedden talked about the infertility problem before it even came out they said in
[3:35:58.520 --> 3:36:05.000]  theory this is going to make proteins it's going to bind with your uterus that in so that and in
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:09.640]  the placenta and so pregnant women will may lose their babies you can't bring this out when you
[3:36:09.640 --> 3:36:14.280]  need to have more testing before you do this and they ignored all this you see so they knew about
[3:36:14.280 --> 3:36:19.960]  it and they ignored it and they purposely are attacking the infirm that you know the people
[3:36:19.960 --> 3:36:24.520]  that they think are let's face it we've seen this term before kind of the useless mouth breathers
[3:36:24.520 --> 3:36:28.600]  people that are only taking money from the government they're not contributing they don't
[3:36:28.600 --> 3:36:32.760]  like that and i'm not you know i can't speak to motive i'm not a lawyer and i'm not inside their
[3:36:32.760 --> 3:36:37.480]  head but this is what it sure looks like to me so it's really really ugly and how do we take
[3:36:37.480 --> 3:36:41.640]  care of ourselves here here's one of the problems and the saddest thing in this whole thing could be
[3:36:41.640 --> 3:36:47.080]  in my opinion is let's say that you're a grandmother and you how many i hear this all the time grandma
[3:36:47.080 --> 3:36:51.320]  is told by her children oh you can't see your grandchild until you come get a vaccine because
[3:36:51.320 --> 3:36:55.720]  they're totally bought into this they haven't even done the due diligence as i said earlier on alex's
[3:36:56.360 --> 3:37:01.400]  segment that of looking at this like a used car you know read something outside of what the car
[3:37:01.400 --> 3:37:05.320]  dealer is telling you okay they're just listening to the car dealer in this case the pharmaceutical
[3:37:05.320 --> 3:37:09.480]  sellers uh that's what the 95 percent was that isn't a real number that shows up anywhere that's
[3:37:09.480 --> 3:37:13.800]  just propaganda so they're just listening to them and just running out and getting this vaccine for
[3:37:13.800 --> 3:37:18.200]  themselves and their children but let's just think about this so grandma wants to see her grandchildren
[3:37:18.200 --> 3:37:22.840]  so she takes the vaccine against her will but she takes it and then she goes and she what does she
[3:37:22.840 --> 3:37:28.200]  do she could shed on her 10-year-old granddaughter render her sterile is that what's going on you
[3:37:28.200 --> 3:37:33.880]  see when you don't test you don't know and that's that is the point of that paper that i bring up
[3:37:33.880 --> 3:37:39.880]  about the mice because that's exactly what happened with them they shed and and transferred infertility
[3:37:39.880 --> 3:37:47.000]  to other mice so these you know we're you know we're in a we're in a you know so many people want
[3:37:47.000 --> 3:37:52.360]  to want to give them every benefit of the doubt and they want to say oh you know it was an emergency
[3:37:52.360 --> 3:37:57.720]  and so they did all this just to help the emergency this was an emergency with a 99.8
[3:37:57.720 --> 3:38:05.240]  percent survival rate in the world okay yes so this is not that big an emergency you know
[3:38:05.240 --> 3:38:12.280]  and this yet this year we're seeing a 42 percent increase in all cause mortality now why is that
[3:38:12.280 --> 3:38:17.720]  happening because these things are toxic to your immune system for a variety of reasons and that's
[3:38:17.720 --> 3:38:23.320]  it's going to get that the that we have not begun to see the avalanche of death and disability from
[3:38:23.320 --> 3:38:30.040]  these things yet so absolutely it's not a panic it's not a pandemic if the only people dying
[3:38:30.040 --> 3:38:34.280]  they're not peeling off on the street they're only dying in the icu on an experimental drug
[3:38:34.280 --> 3:38:39.800]  called remdesivir with a ventilator that is not a pandemic by any means and i hope people are
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:44.600]  starting to realize that they did not go to more funerals in the last two years than they've ever
[3:38:44.600 --> 3:38:50.760]  gone to in their life we are not a situation in a situation that we can that we can even call pandemic
[3:38:50.760 --> 3:38:55.160]  not even close yet they're getting away with it in the press and they'll never ever go back and
[3:38:55.160 --> 3:38:59.960]  they'll always call it a pandemic but we really need to cut through and see the truth did you
[3:38:59.960 --> 3:39:04.440]  want to comment on why we're seeing so many hiv articles because i know in the last segment
[3:39:04.440 --> 3:39:10.120]  we'll talk about what you can do to keep yourself safe throughout the rest of this flu season but
[3:39:10.120 --> 3:39:14.920]  what about the hiv articles that are suddenly cropping up because we know this is where Fauci
[3:39:14.920 --> 3:39:20.920]  made his big debut was in AIDS very interesting that it's cropping up right and and and prince harry
[3:39:20.920 --> 3:39:25.400]  suddenly saying oh you should all even you people that are not gay and no drug abuse you should go
[3:39:25.400 --> 3:39:31.960]  out and get tested for AIDS what did he know right well let me just and as i told and and i think
[3:39:31.960 --> 3:39:36.440]  alex remember this that i told said this a long time ago this is how i knew it was a bio weapon
[3:39:36.440 --> 3:39:41.320]  this paper was published in january of 2020 it was forcibly withdrawn but it was out there and people
[3:39:41.320 --> 3:39:45.880]  could have read it people in science should have known about it that there were four artificial hiv
[3:39:45.880 --> 3:39:52.280]  inserts into the spike protein okay that's that was came out of the lab so what are they doing there
[3:39:52.280 --> 3:39:57.080]  well it may have nothing to do with those okay there's a lot of reasons this thing could be damaging
[3:39:57.080 --> 3:40:05.320]  your immune system the the graphene oxide the um the known cationic lipids there's lots of things
[3:40:05.320 --> 3:40:10.440]  and the known micro here's what they did to be very honest it's not that they just didn't know
[3:40:10.440 --> 3:40:16.360]  about the um the what were we just talking about the shedding that they didn't know that they were
[3:40:16.360 --> 3:40:22.120]  willing to go through that and miss that they also don't really know when they you know it sounds
[3:40:22.120 --> 3:40:27.560]  good to say oh we're using mRNA technology but what are they really doing unfortunately this is
[3:40:27.560 --> 3:40:34.600]  one of those things when you screw around with the basic dna rna of life and you screw around with
[3:40:34.600 --> 3:40:42.200]  these very complicated algorithmic kind of things that happen in the body that that that are very
[3:40:43.000 --> 3:40:50.040]  dependent on you know lots of little moving parts and lots of mRNAs and dna's that are that are just
[3:40:50.040 --> 3:40:55.400]  it's like this well choreographed dance that god created and now man's trying to screw around with
[3:40:55.400 --> 3:40:59.960]  it and like that old commercial for the butter that's a fake butter was it's not good to fool
[3:40:59.960 --> 3:41:05.160]  mother nature so they've got these they've got these things that are called micro RNAs so it's
[3:41:05.160 --> 3:41:09.640]  they make it sound like they're giving you this one little bit of RNA that'll make the spike protein
[3:41:09.640 --> 3:41:15.160]  that's not true they they they admit now there are other RNAs in there and these some of these are
[3:41:15.160 --> 3:41:23.560]  called self-amplifying RNAs and they're micro RNAs and these act at a very upstream level to change
[3:41:23.560 --> 3:41:31.000]  your overall response your immune response somehow and the issue is they they don't really have it
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:36.200]  all nailed down how you know they know they're doing some things they know by the way that they had
[3:41:36.200 --> 3:41:41.640]  to decrease your immune response in order to get this stuff to stay around long enough to have any
[3:41:41.640 --> 3:41:46.760]  effect they know they had to decrease your immune response to get it into your genetic material to
[3:41:46.760 --> 3:41:52.680]  produce the spike protein and and for genetic therapies and cancer therapies which these were
[3:41:52.680 --> 3:41:56.440]  designed to be they know they had to decrease your immune response in order to get it into your
[3:41:56.440 --> 3:42:03.160]  nucleus which MIT and other researchers now say is happening so this is not by accident they decreased
[3:42:03.160 --> 3:42:07.960]  our immune response and what's a decreased immune response it's called acquired immunodeficiency
[3:42:08.600 --> 3:42:13.400]  you know it's not like that's a new that's a descriptive term it's not like it's not like
[3:42:13.400 --> 3:42:19.480]  malaria or you know brucellosis named for some bacterium it's it's a it's a syndrome and we
[3:42:19.480 --> 3:42:24.600]  you can have congenital meaning you were born with an with an immune deficiency you can have
[3:42:24.600 --> 3:42:29.400]  an acquired immune deficiency that happens later in life and they're just giving it now a cutesy
[3:42:29.400 --> 3:42:34.840]  named vades as opposed to aids and making it sound like oh it's just something that happens
[3:42:34.840 --> 3:42:42.040]  you know it's like um it's like the the issue of contact between sexual contract between men
[3:42:42.040 --> 3:42:49.880]  and women and now they've come out with a with a new syndrome called winter vagina because women are
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:57.800]  we'll come right back with dr. lee merit wow uh i'm k dally your guest host sold out for months x

[3:44:54.920 --> 3:45:03.000]  at m4store.com today the globalist social engineers always intended to push their covid biomedical
[3:45:03.000 --> 3:45:10.520]  tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled they would then use that as the pretext for
[3:45:10.520 --> 3:45:16.920]  permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their loss but
[3:45:16.920 --> 3:45:21.960]  because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and and
[3:45:21.960 --> 3:45:27.640]  whistleblowers now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[3:45:27.640 --> 3:45:34.280]  that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than
[3:45:34.280 --> 3:45:39.400]  ever the problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover
[3:45:39.400 --> 3:45:46.040]  like canada where they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in ontario and other
[3:45:46.040 --> 3:45:50.440]  areas of the world are following suit like australia so pray for these folks big time
[3:45:50.440 --> 3:45:55.560]  this is a very serious situation and stay tuned into info wars dot com because truth is absolutely
[3:45:55.560 --> 3:46:02.760]  paramount whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the
[3:46:02.760 --> 3:46:09.160]  assault on our democracy insurrection we will follow the facts wherever they lead domestic
[3:46:09.160 --> 3:46:16.040]  terrorists the days of independent media are numbered the government has made it illegal to
[3:46:16.040 --> 3:46:22.200]  oppose them they are now debanking us behind the scenes they want to bankrupt us and make us go
[3:46:22.200 --> 3:46:29.240]  away quietly with practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps the
[3:46:29.240 --> 3:46:35.000]  traders know they can shut us down by force but that would accelerate the awakening exponentially
[3:46:35.560 --> 3:46:43.080]  so be it make them silence us by force this is the final battle of the information war give now
[3:46:43.080 --> 3:46:51.560]  by products donate before everything changes we need you to carry us through to the end victory
[3:46:51.560 --> 3:47:00.840]  or death go now to info war store dot com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[3:47:00.840 --> 3:47:14.840]  order it's alex jones
[3:47:14.840 --> 3:47:21.640]  show at cate dally radio dot com my guest dr lee merit the wonderful dr lee merit frontline
[3:47:21.640 --> 3:47:28.040]  doctor and you can go to the medical rebel dot com the medical rebel dot com to get more information
[3:47:28.040 --> 3:47:33.640]  she covers so many topics there and also can give great help on how you can prepare for this season
[3:47:33.640 --> 3:47:40.040]  but dr merit like we can't let winter vagina go i mean he really what in the hell you really need
[3:47:40.040 --> 3:47:46.200]  to comment on this winter vagina what is making again they're they're making up diseases to explain
[3:47:46.200 --> 3:47:52.760]  what they're seeing as a consequence of these damaging vaccines so a man takes a takes a vaccine
[3:47:52.760 --> 3:47:58.120]  and his wife gets a vaginal outbreak of a virus or a rash or something that's painful
[3:47:58.120 --> 3:48:04.040]  and then now it's winter vagina another another example now we have it all this chest pain that
[3:48:04.040 --> 3:48:10.040]  these guys are getting mostly guys but other other people it's now post covid stress syndrome
[3:48:10.760 --> 3:48:17.080]  okay and shovel no shoveling is dangerous now it raises your cardiovascular like rolling dough
[3:48:17.080 --> 3:48:21.160]  or taking a walk or having sex people are just going to peel off and die and they're just going
[3:48:21.160 --> 3:48:26.520]  to say that now they're just in cardiovascular you know a hell or nightmare or something and
[3:48:26.520 --> 3:48:32.040]  they'll never contribute it to the shot will they yeah there it is cold weather can cause winter
[3:48:32.040 --> 3:48:38.600]  vagina yeah it's it's unbelievable but you see the point is that they're changing the language
[3:48:38.600 --> 3:48:43.240]  and they're trying and i just don't think it's going to work this time i think enough people
[3:48:43.240 --> 3:48:50.200]  but but we we need to realize though that history can be changed in a couple generations you know
[3:48:50.200 --> 3:48:54.760]  it doesn't take long for people to forget the truth we have to keep speaking the truth and
[3:48:54.760 --> 3:48:59.720]  every time we speak the truth then somebody else is empowered to speak the truth it's it's really
[3:48:59.720 --> 3:49:03.560]  important to take back our language here and that's you know i'm trying to think of another one
[3:49:03.560 --> 3:49:07.640]  there's been a bunch of these things but they're trying to normalize heart attacks in children
[3:49:07.640 --> 3:49:14.680]  they're no and and that's what i would say is even even one of my favorite commenters uh
[3:49:14.680 --> 3:49:20.840]  nolte at Breitbart who usually writes great articles he got suckered into this it's the unvaccinated
[3:49:20.840 --> 3:49:25.480]  pandemic in the hospitals right now no the people they're getting sick are not getting sick with
[3:49:25.480 --> 3:49:30.200]  covid per se they're getting sick and they're vaccinated but they're not defining them as
[3:49:30.200 --> 3:49:35.480]  vaccinated so you have to be really cautious about when they change the definition things
[3:49:35.480 --> 3:49:42.120]  and that's what's happening so um yeah and like dr judy mykabit says she said you know these are
[3:49:42.120 --> 3:49:46.920]  my somatic kind of machines that that you can put anything into this is why i was asking you
[3:49:46.920 --> 3:49:52.280]  about hiv and all of a sudden now you know we're looking at well actually let me let me talk about
[3:49:52.280 --> 3:49:55.800]  this because you made a great point and i want to i want to expand on this a little bit you said
[3:49:55.800 --> 3:50:01.000]  it's so delicate and whatever they're doing in this to take down our immune system systematically
[3:50:01.000 --> 3:50:07.320]  through a series of shots when they added squaling the oil emulsifying squaling to the anthrax shot
[3:50:07.320 --> 3:50:12.360]  and started giving it to our servicemen uh they you know obviously then they started calling it
[3:50:12.360 --> 3:50:16.360]  gulf war syndrome and they never stopped giving that shot regardless of the fact we never had an
[3:50:16.360 --> 3:50:21.560]  anthrax scare amongst our military but they keep giving those shots and it affected us mentally
[3:50:21.560 --> 3:50:27.160]  it affected their immune systems most importantly and they started adding that squaling to the flu
[3:50:27.160 --> 3:50:32.280]  shots and so this is really interesting because when you take an ingredient and you start injecting
[3:50:32.280 --> 3:50:36.760]  people with it and then you have to call it something to get away with doing it and you're
[3:50:36.760 --> 3:50:41.240]  hurting people's health and mental health there's a problem with this obviously we're all going to
[3:50:41.240 --> 3:50:46.920]  agree and so we don't know what is exactly in this shot i don't think we'll ever have all of the
[3:50:46.920 --> 3:50:52.680]  information do you well only if they come clean and let out the the research data you know they
[3:50:52.680 --> 3:50:57.960]  don't have to tell you right now what they have to do is only tell you that part that they are
[3:50:57.960 --> 3:51:02.840]  claiming efficacy for and that's the spike protein so they can tell you it's the mRNA that produces
[3:51:02.840 --> 3:51:07.480]  the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and that's bad enough that alone should have stopped people from
[3:51:07.480 --> 3:51:12.200]  wanting to take it once you understand that that was the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is an artificially
[3:51:12.200 --> 3:51:17.880]  created toxic nanoparticle but there are other things that we did know about we knew about we knew
[3:51:17.880 --> 3:51:21.960]  about this well they didn't label the squaling in a way that most people would recognize it but it's
[3:51:21.960 --> 3:51:28.840]  it is in there but they did label peg for example polyethylene glycol it's good and we have 10 times
[3:51:28.840 --> 3:51:35.560]  the number of anaphylaxis reported than we did in any other vaccine ever rolled out
[3:51:35.560 --> 3:51:41.880]  um you then but they don't care about the numbers they don't care about the numbers they and let's
[3:51:41.880 --> 3:51:46.840]  be honest they don't care about the data they and that's why they can hide things and you have to be
[3:51:46.840 --> 3:51:51.560]  really careful when you look at the data that's the one thing they can't hide that's why i like all
[3:51:51.560 --> 3:51:57.320]  cause mortality as an indicator of what's going on and i think i learned this from you because in 2020
[3:51:57.320 --> 3:52:03.640]  with a year of the great pandemic you pointed out that you looked at cemeteries and funeral homes
[3:52:03.640 --> 3:52:08.520]  and they were not increasing their capacity right if we had this huge pandemic why aren't we not
[3:52:08.520 --> 3:52:13.720]  building more cemeteries right so that's an interesting point so the all cause mortality
[3:52:13.720 --> 3:52:19.000]  in 2020 was not up in fact after we talked i went back and looked at it when it took a it took a
[3:52:19.000 --> 3:52:25.320]  while for the numbers to show up but at the the un collects total mortality data and the mortality
[3:52:25.320 --> 3:52:34.120]  data in 2020 was 7.612 per 100 000 per year or so or per thousand per year and that's below
[3:52:34.840 --> 3:52:42.600]  every year from 1950 to 2015 okay so they did we did not have increased all cause mortality in 2020
[3:52:42.600 --> 3:52:49.720]  but we are having it for sure in 2021 now yes i get into this debate sometimes with one of my
[3:52:49.720 --> 3:52:56.600]  sons who's in medicine and and and the argument is oh that database is wrong or that that that
[3:52:56.600 --> 3:53:02.520]  calculation is wrong you know you can maybe say that about one thing but the in law unlike medicine
[3:53:02.520 --> 3:53:06.920]  now medicine we apparently just look at at individual things and never create a pattern
[3:53:06.920 --> 3:53:11.800]  but in law they look at the preponderance of evidence and they and if you look at the preponderance
[3:53:11.800 --> 3:53:17.400]  of evidence here on all fronts you're seeing athletes die like you've never seen these things
[3:53:17.400 --> 3:53:21.800]  before it's not that we don't see soccer players with cardiac problems but not like this you'd
[3:53:21.800 --> 3:53:27.000]  have to go back 40 years and add a bunch of years together to see this many problems and we've seen
[3:53:27.000 --> 3:53:34.680]  we see that we see the yes the celebrities we see uh the the on s data out of england saying there's
[3:53:34.680 --> 3:53:39.160]  an increased serious increase in all cause mortality now we have insurance companies
[3:53:39.160 --> 3:53:44.280]  saying there's serious increase all mortality we have nurses squeaking out in the hospital and
[3:53:44.280 --> 3:53:50.360]  saying these are the vaccinated it's a it's the preponderance of evidence we need to pay attention
[3:53:50.360 --> 3:53:58.200]  here absolutely ours is a high and theirs is just believe us right yeah and you know this
[3:53:58.200 --> 3:54:03.160]  comedian i don't wish anybody to have a problem i don't wish ill on anybody but you know she's
[3:54:03.160 --> 3:54:07.560]  making fun of the anti what they could they and they make these words up to be derogatory the
[3:54:07.560 --> 3:54:13.960]  anti-vaxxers she's clearly making fun of them she's making fun of christians and then it happens
[3:54:13.960 --> 3:54:22.360]  to her we'll see if she has a an epiphany here because she hit hard enough to break her skull
[3:54:22.360 --> 3:54:29.240]  you know um that's in fact we we have a just a few minutes left and i wanted to give the audience
[3:54:29.240 --> 3:54:32.920]  what are the five things they should be taking right now to keep their immune system up in
[3:54:32.920 --> 3:54:37.080]  your opinion what should they have in their arsenal well and actually that's why i put
[3:54:37.080 --> 3:54:43.080]  together my immune my immune stack is on my website or you can support me but it does happen to
[3:54:43.080 --> 3:54:47.480]  have a couple things so you know antioxidate your life you know and this is not just about
[3:54:47.480 --> 3:54:53.800]  supplements it's about eating correctly exercising do the things that you uh that it's not the time
[3:54:53.800 --> 3:54:59.160]  to eat junk food and and junk food with bad oils increases inflammation so you need to live the
[3:54:59.160 --> 3:55:03.080]  anti-inflammatory lifestyle there's lots of literature about that i put some things on my
[3:55:03.080 --> 3:55:07.560]  website about that but the other thing is there's certain things we know about this vaccine for
[3:55:07.560 --> 3:55:12.520]  example and in general methylation methylation goes down after you take the vaccine and methylation
[3:55:12.520 --> 3:55:17.400]  is what's what's critical for protecting you against a lot of things neurologic problems
[3:55:17.400 --> 3:55:24.600]  cancer so i have in mind betaine which is trimethyl glycine it's not only a glycine donor it's a
[3:55:24.600 --> 3:55:30.760]  methyl donor and you need both of those things selenium here's a here's a hot tip the Fauci guys
[3:55:30.760 --> 3:55:36.120]  were giving AZT right they they they gave AZT and the gay community has a little bit of a heart
[3:55:36.120 --> 3:55:40.840]  attack with the Fauci and those guys because they said they killed a lot of us and that's what
[3:55:40.840 --> 3:55:45.480]  happened they killed a lot of gay people during that period of time with this overdose on these
[3:55:45.480 --> 3:55:51.560]  toxic chemicals but but other researchers at the same time had had noticed that that for some reason
[3:55:51.560 --> 3:55:58.200]  people that had selenium selenium seemed to protect the the T lymphocytes and so they started
[3:55:58.200 --> 3:56:05.640]  giving people selenium and those people never progressed from positive test for HIV to AIDS
[3:56:05.640 --> 3:56:10.920]  or they did it was less than 90 percent i mean it was 90 90 percent were protected essentially
[3:56:10.920 --> 3:56:18.200]  yeah so it dropped it from 100 to 10 percent or a lot so the point is that selenium helps
[3:56:18.760 --> 3:56:25.080]  and um and i heard dr buta early on in this whole thing saying selenium was birth control for viruses
[3:56:25.080 --> 3:56:30.520]  even if the viruses don't exist as we think selenium is doing something really good now you
[3:56:30.520 --> 3:56:36.360]  don't overdose on that you know and then yeah i honestly vitamin c you can't beat vitamin c
[3:56:37.640 --> 3:56:42.520]  saunas are a great thing you have to be a little bit concerned about the emf at some of them but
[3:56:42.520 --> 3:56:47.720]  most of them i mean the 20 minute hot sauna helps you purge one of the great things you can do for
[3:56:47.720 --> 3:56:52.120]  your immune system again it's not a supplement that you buy it's just a lifestyle confine your
[3:56:52.120 --> 3:56:57.640]  eating to a 10 hour window it's called there's a lot of evidence that that improves your immune
[3:56:57.640 --> 3:57:03.800]  system fasting actually even more you want to go on a fast for a week you know there's a prolon diet
[3:57:03.800 --> 3:57:10.680]  that a guy just devised but you can you can find all sorts of there's a i'm thinking i'm blanking
[3:57:10.680 --> 3:57:16.040]  on his name right now but it's called the first fasting handbook he wrote the obesity code up in
[3:57:16.040 --> 3:57:20.200]  canada he's a canadian physician and so he's got all about fasting and the benefits to your immune
[3:57:20.200 --> 3:57:25.560]  system this is the kinds of things we should be doing not taking toxic agents like remdesi
[3:57:25.560 --> 3:57:30.600]  you've got this we're out of time but you've got all of this on themedicalrubble.com i really
