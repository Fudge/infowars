[00:00.000 --> 00:10.080]  Well, I don't know what will happen now.
[00:10.080 --> 00:14.960]  We've got some difficult days ahead, but I'm not concerned about that now.
[00:14.960 --> 00:24.560]  I just want to do God's will, and He's allowed me to go up to the mountain, and I've looked
[00:24.560 --> 00:31.560]  over, and I've seen the promised land.
[00:31.560 --> 00:42.560]  I may not get that with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land.
[00:42.560 --> 00:44.560]  We've got to come together.
[00:44.560 --> 00:48.560]  Whether you believe it or not, you've got to decide whether you have dominion over yourself.
[00:48.560 --> 00:56.560]  I believe that the majority of the plain people of the United States will day in and day out make pure mistakes in governing themselves.
[00:56.560 --> 01:02.560]  And any smaller class or body of men, no matter what they're creating, will make in trying to govern them.
[01:02.560 --> 01:12.560]  And you've got to decide whether it's God that's going to have dominion over you, that you get orders from, or whether some other human that's jacked into the evil force is going to have dominion over you.
[01:12.560 --> 01:23.560]  What we're talking about now is like a second industrial revolution, but the product this time will not be textiles or machines or vehicles or even weapons.
[01:23.560 --> 01:26.560]  The product this time will be humans themselves.
[01:26.560 --> 01:29.560]  Do we want to have a human plan or a post-human plan?
[01:29.560 --> 01:36.560]  Novol Harari and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates say humans are obsolete, we're scum, because they know we are their competition.
[01:36.560 --> 01:42.560]  They know that if we go for what we want and what God wants us to have, they can't compete with that transmission.
[01:42.560 --> 01:44.560]  They can't compete with that blueprint.
[01:44.560 --> 01:46.560]  They can't compete without architecture.
[01:46.560 --> 01:50.560]  They can't compete with that master plan, but I just see it now.
[01:50.560 --> 01:52.560]  It'll be so clear soon.
[01:52.560 --> 01:54.560]  Are you pro-human or are you anti-human?
[01:54.560 --> 01:57.560]  You are the human resistance to this alien takeover.
[01:57.560 --> 02:05.560]  And again, when I say alien takeover, I don't mean some little tinfoil flying saucer crashing in Roswell from Alpha Centuries.
[02:05.560 --> 02:16.560]  I'm talking about the transmission in the universe of God's order and God's will, or do you choose to serve the agents of death?
[02:16.560 --> 02:19.560]  And like Martin Luther King said, we're not going to judge them off what color they are.
[02:19.560 --> 02:24.560]  We're going to judge them off of the character of their actions and deeds.
[02:24.560 --> 02:27.560]  So I'm going to say it right now, real clear.
[02:27.560 --> 02:34.560]  I love everybody, no matter what color your beautiful skin is, what I care about your heart and your guts and your mind.
[02:34.560 --> 02:39.560]  And you're under attack by these Satanists and they want to kill you and they want to kill your children.
[02:39.560 --> 02:47.560]  And I say we set our differences aside and I say we come together and we beat these people and we smash their technocracy
[02:47.560 --> 02:52.560]  and we build the future together and we can do anything with our real diversity.
[02:52.560 --> 02:55.560]  These enemies tell us all day about diversity.
[02:55.560 --> 02:58.560]  They mean divided and conquered groups of people separate from each other.
[02:58.560 --> 03:04.560]  This bill is supported by all of the Democrats, House and Senate.
[03:04.560 --> 03:07.560]  It's just the filibuster in a way.
[03:07.560 --> 03:21.560]  So in a way, if you really truly want to honor Dr. King, don't dishonor him by using a congressional custom as an excuse for protecting our democracy.
[03:21.560 --> 03:26.560]  But I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for Mayor Trump and you ain't black.
[03:26.560 --> 03:37.560]  I want unity under a code of freedom and liberty and justice and coming together and working together and being strong.
[03:37.560 --> 03:48.560]  And that's what Info Wars is and that's why the enemies of humanity hate us so much because we love God and God loves humanity.
[03:48.560 --> 03:52.560]  And I am a human supremacist.
[03:52.560 --> 03:55.560]  I am a human supremacist.
[03:55.560 --> 03:58.560]  I am a human supremacist.
[03:58.560 --> 04:01.560]  I am a human supremacist.
[04:01.560 --> 04:04.560]  I am a human supremacist.
[04:04.560 --> 04:08.560]  That term will be the future war with the robots and the AI.
[04:08.560 --> 04:13.560]  What you're hearing now is the entire future and everything they try to stop us from doing.
[04:13.560 --> 04:16.560]  Our supremacy will not end with this planet.
[04:16.560 --> 04:18.560]  We will keep all the stars.
[04:18.560 --> 04:19.560]  We will colonize.
[04:19.560 --> 04:21.560]  We will green dead worlds.
[04:21.560 --> 04:23.560]  We will go interdimensional.
[04:23.560 --> 04:25.560]  We will unlock the secrets of the universe.
[04:25.560 --> 04:28.560]  God has laid them out like Christmas presents for his children.
[04:28.560 --> 04:35.560]  And I am extremely honored to be in the fulcrum and the heart of the fight to bring our race.
[04:35.560 --> 04:39.560]  The human race in a race for the future.
[04:39.560 --> 04:41.560]  We will break the enemy.
[04:41.560 --> 04:43.560]  We will break the pedophiles.
[04:43.560 --> 04:50.560]  We will break the Satanist because God already sent his own self down here to show us he could do it.
[04:50.560 --> 04:53.560]  God would never ask us to go through an obstacle course.
[04:53.560 --> 04:54.560]  He wouldn't go through.
[04:54.560 --> 04:56.560]  And now we're going to go through what Christ did.
[04:56.560 --> 05:01.560]  And we're going to go through it and we're going to be destroyed but reborn on him.
[05:01.560 --> 05:06.560]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want you to read.
[05:06.560 --> 05:11.560]  That most of the big powerful companies trying to control your life, the big tech companies,
[05:11.560 --> 05:14.560]  they don't want you to read this book.
[05:14.560 --> 05:19.560]  They want to control what you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want that.
[05:19.560 --> 05:20.560]  John Jones doesn't want that.
[05:20.560 --> 05:26.560]  And this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it.
[05:26.560 --> 05:30.560]  And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work.
[05:30.560 --> 05:32.560]  That freedom is alive in this country.
[05:32.560 --> 05:34.560]  This is essential reading.
[05:34.560 --> 05:39.560]  And, you know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in.
[05:39.560 --> 05:41.560]  It's not going to be available in bookstores.
[05:41.560 --> 05:43.560]  It's not going to be available in libraries.
[05:43.560 --> 05:47.560]  They're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can,
[05:47.560 --> 05:49.560]  but they're not going to be able to do it.
[05:49.560 --> 05:51.560]  Prove that censorship doesn't work.
[05:51.560 --> 05:52.560]  Buy the great reset.
[05:52.560 --> 05:53.560]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[05:53.560 --> 05:55.560]  I really appreciate you having me on.
[05:55.560 --> 06:19.560]  And I appreciate you writing this book and getting the information out there.
[06:42.560 --> 06:48.560]  It's Monday, August 8th, the year 2022 under host Alex Jones.
[06:48.560 --> 06:52.560]  And they passed their bill back better bill under a new name.
[06:52.560 --> 06:55.560]  And they cheered and celebrated.
[06:55.560 --> 06:56.560]  Here's the footage.
[06:56.560 --> 07:01.560]  On this vote, the Yays are 50.
[07:01.560 --> 07:02.560]  The Nays are 50.
[07:02.560 --> 07:04.560]  The Senate being equally divided.
[07:04.560 --> 07:07.560]  The Vice President votes in the affirmative.
[07:07.560 --> 07:23.560]  The bill, as amended, is passed.
[07:23.560 --> 07:31.560]  The continued strangling of America under the great reset bill back better is ongoing.
[07:31.560 --> 07:37.560]  The legislation massively raises taxes on poor people in the middle class and gets rid of taxes on billionaires.
[07:37.560 --> 07:38.560]  That's all confirmed.
[07:38.560 --> 07:41.560]  We'll be going over it.
[07:41.560 --> 07:45.560]  The legislation hires 87,000 new bureaucrats at the IRS.
[07:45.560 --> 07:52.560]  That's more bureaucrats than the Pentagon, Homeland Security, and the Border Patrol have combined.
[07:52.560 --> 08:00.560]  And they admit it's for mainly blue collar people like Uber drivers and pizza delivery people.
[08:00.560 --> 08:05.560]  Absolutely incredible as they wage war on the little guy.
[08:05.560 --> 08:09.560]  That's what the Democratic Party is now, is cancer.
[08:09.560 --> 08:15.560]  Republicans actually tried to raise taxes on the hedge fund billionaires.
[08:15.560 --> 08:18.560]  Make them actually pay more capital gains, but that got shot down.
[08:18.560 --> 08:23.560]  We live in upside down world, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:23.560 --> 08:28.560]  Absolutely insane.
[08:28.560 --> 08:33.560]  I woke up this morning and my phone was ringing.
[08:33.560 --> 08:37.560]  And a few family called me and they said, have you seen what's all over the news?
[08:37.560 --> 08:39.560]  I said, no.
[08:39.560 --> 08:47.560]  They said, well, one of the biggest newspapers in Italy, owned by this big billionaire that owns major sports teams,
[08:47.560 --> 08:56.560]  said child porn was found on your phone that was leaked to the opposition lawyers in the Sandy Hook kangaroo court.
[08:56.560 --> 08:58.560]  A, they didn't get my phone.
[08:58.560 --> 09:01.560]  They got a little segment of text.
[09:01.560 --> 09:04.560]  B, there's no child porn on there.
[09:04.560 --> 09:10.560]  But you've got to ask yourself, in what world have these people gotten so reckless?
[09:10.560 --> 09:16.560]  And then all these leftist pundits who have jobs at media companies are all over Twitter.
[09:16.560 --> 09:21.560]  It was trending today, Alex Jones' phone again, but child porn.
[09:21.560 --> 09:23.560]  There's no end to these people.
[09:23.560 --> 09:32.560]  I supposedly had my phone and it was one text message from Paul Joseph Watson saying this COVID story looks like BS like Sandy Hook.
[09:32.560 --> 09:34.560]  That's their big haul.
[09:34.560 --> 09:41.560]  I've reviewed all the text messages.
[09:41.560 --> 09:48.560]  I shared a picture of my wife in a bikini.
[09:48.560 --> 09:56.560]  That's the raciest thing that is in my phone where you're sitting there talking to your buddies.
[09:56.560 --> 09:57.560]  They send you a picture of their wife.
[09:57.560 --> 10:00.560]  You send them a picture of yours, proud of our wives.
[10:00.560 --> 10:02.560]  That is as racy as it gets.
[10:02.560 --> 10:09.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, a nice leopard print, by the way.
[10:09.560 --> 10:11.560]  Maybe I should put the picture on air.
[10:11.560 --> 10:19.560]  But the point is, is that, no, there's a 40 year old woman in a bikini.
[10:19.560 --> 10:20.560]  That's as racy as it gets.
[10:20.560 --> 10:27.560]  My wife, 40 year old woman.
[10:27.560 --> 10:29.560]  I'm married to.
[10:29.560 --> 10:33.560]  And that turns into child porn.
[10:33.560 --> 10:36.560]  That is the upside down world of these people.
[10:36.560 --> 10:45.560]  And listen, I'm not a litigious person, but I am going to have to sue these people.
[10:45.560 --> 10:50.560]  But they think it's just open season, open season.
[10:50.560 --> 10:52.560]  And what does that tell you about the establishment?
[10:52.560 --> 11:01.560]  They and their minions are completely and totally out of control and are making their move on our civilization.
[11:01.560 --> 11:03.560]  What are we going to do about it?
[11:03.560 --> 11:08.560]  But I'm not going to sit here today and talk about myself a bunch.
[11:08.560 --> 11:16.560]  Even though this case they now admit is for everybody, it's meant to take down the populist movement, not just here but worldwide.
[11:16.560 --> 11:20.560]  And understanding why they hate me is important to understand how to beat them.
[11:20.560 --> 11:24.560]  So I'll talk some about that in the third hour today.
[11:24.560 --> 11:30.560]  We have a special guest joining us who's also been persecuted for their speech, Laura Loomer.
[11:30.560 --> 11:43.560]  So in the meantime, I intend to open the phones up and I intend to cover the economic news, the incredible military news, the absolutely insane collapsing borders news,
[11:43.560 --> 11:51.560]  this economic warfare legislation they passed with this army of IRS agents and bureaucrats.
[11:51.560 --> 11:54.560]  What's happened with inflation?
[11:54.560 --> 11:58.560]  What future show prices are going to be even higher?
[11:58.560 --> 12:02.560]  It's just an incredible time to be alive.
[12:02.560 --> 12:07.560]  Also, Hollywood is showing the fastest collapse in its history of collapsing.
[12:07.560 --> 12:18.560]  They're now in free fall going straight down as major entertainment companies across the board start dumping woke content as viewership tumbles.
[12:18.560 --> 12:20.560]  And that's the good news.
[12:20.560 --> 12:35.560]  The leftist neoliberal globalist godless satanic corporate establishment is hated and reviled and being rejected and gained its power in the last 50 years by devaluing major western currencies,
[12:35.560 --> 12:39.560]  which they controlled to buy up all the infrastructure for themselves.
[12:39.560 --> 12:49.560]  And now they want to leave us holding the bag of inflation and economic collapse and taxes.
[12:49.560 --> 12:52.560]  And the public's not going to put up with it.
[12:52.560 --> 12:57.560]  So they could try to single me out as an image of populism that they hate.
[12:57.560 --> 13:06.560]  And they can think that is trying to destroy us and attacking us and lying about us is going to be a message to everybody else that if you get out of line,
[13:06.560 --> 13:08.560]  we're going to destroy you next.
[13:08.560 --> 13:10.560]  Well, they're coming for you anyways.
[13:10.560 --> 13:14.560]  They're already hitting you with poison shots and releasing bio weapons out of labs.
[13:14.560 --> 13:19.560]  They're already trying to brainwash and destroy your children's innocence.
[13:19.560 --> 13:27.560]  The only way you lose is by submitting to these people and by being intimidated by these people.
[13:27.560 --> 13:33.560]  The head of the most prestigious medical journal hands down in the world.
[13:33.560 --> 13:37.560]  We're actually finding people have a soul out there.
[13:37.560 --> 13:40.560]  We've had the heads of a bunch of medical journals come out.
[13:40.560 --> 13:51.560]  The New England Medical Journal eight months ago came out and said, yeah, there's massive increases in miscarriages for those that take these shots.
[13:51.560 --> 13:54.560]  Well, what's the new studies?
[13:54.560 --> 13:56.560]  He's looking at a group of studies.
[13:56.560 --> 14:01.560]  The head of the Lancet.
[14:01.560 --> 14:09.560]  COVID-19 investigation says he is convinced it came out of a lab.
[14:09.560 --> 14:13.560]  Well, the Indians own a CRISPR machine.
[14:13.560 --> 14:20.560]  Well, like 20 of them in the world last time I checked, they cost $3 billion.
[14:20.560 --> 14:24.560]  And they scan the damn thing and it's got five viruses wedged into it.
[14:24.560 --> 14:29.560]  Just like in the old movies, Frankenstein's got stitches where they sew different body parts on.
[14:29.560 --> 14:35.560]  Well, it's the same way when they inject these viruses and mix them together and clone them,
[14:35.560 --> 14:38.560]  it leaves the fingerprints of exactly how it was done.
[14:38.560 --> 14:43.560]  In fact, they can even tell what companies did it.
[14:43.560 --> 14:51.560]  They can zoom in with microscopes now and they can see atoms.
[14:51.560 --> 14:58.560]  So a virus compared to a molecule or a group of atoms, the average virus,
[14:58.560 --> 15:02.560]  is like the size of the earth compared to a football.
[15:02.560 --> 15:05.560]  An atom being a football, the earth being the earth.
[15:05.560 --> 15:10.560]  So they can zoom right in on all the little details of where the virus came from,
[15:10.560 --> 15:14.560]  who made this virus, where this virus was manipulated, how it was cloned, how it was placed.
[15:14.560 --> 15:17.560]  They look at this thing and it's like that old song.
[15:17.560 --> 15:21.560]  But Johnny Cash did, I forget the name.
[15:21.560 --> 15:26.560]  I got it one piece at a time and it didn't cost me a dime.
[15:26.560 --> 15:30.560]  You'll know me when I come rolling through your town.
[15:30.560 --> 15:37.560]  They talk about how you worked for a big automaker for 20, 30 years and each year stole different piece.
[15:37.560 --> 15:43.560]  By the end, it was this big giant jalopy, 30 different years in car parts.
[15:43.560 --> 15:49.560]  It's a 49, 59, 69, automobile, all the pieces.
[15:49.560 --> 15:52.560]  So it's all, the house of cars is coming down.
[15:52.560 --> 15:54.560]  We live in a super dangerous time.
[15:54.560 --> 15:55.560]  A lot of big news coming up.
[15:55.560 --> 15:59.560]  Stay with us.
[15:59.560 --> 16:01.560]  People say Alex Jones is crazy.
[16:01.560 --> 16:02.560]  He's a conspiracy theory guy.
[16:02.560 --> 16:03.560]  He's a nutcase.
[16:03.560 --> 16:05.560]  He's got these rants and all that.
[16:05.560 --> 16:13.560]  What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal, not noise.
[16:13.560 --> 16:19.560]  If you look at the signal and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC
[16:19.560 --> 16:25.560]  and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there.
[16:25.560 --> 16:29.560]  And if you're setting a human being and just watching it, you say, well, Alex Jones is ahead of this.
[16:29.560 --> 16:31.560]  Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[16:31.560 --> 16:34.560]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[16:34.560 --> 16:35.560]  That is very rare.
[16:35.560 --> 16:39.560]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[16:39.560 --> 16:43.560]  In this new book, I've got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this thing.
[16:43.560 --> 16:44.560]  I go, this is it.
[16:44.560 --> 16:46.560]  This is no Beatrix.
[16:46.560 --> 16:47.560]  You're not going to be flipping pages.
[16:47.560 --> 16:48.560]  You're going to be having a pen out.
[16:48.560 --> 16:50.560]  You're going to be underlying stuff.

[16:59.560 --> 17:01.560]  Info Wars has been vindicated.
[17:01.560 --> 17:02.560]  We've been proven right.
[17:02.560 --> 17:05.560]  World government, the New World Order is out of the open.
[17:05.560 --> 17:11.560]  And now more than ever, the forces of Satan are trying to shut down this broadcast.
[17:11.560 --> 17:15.560]  The forces of anti-human, godless New World Order are out of control.
[17:15.560 --> 17:20.560]  So now realize, we have pushed them out of the light, we have pushed them out in the open,
[17:20.560 --> 17:22.560]  and they are so upset, and they are so scared.
[17:22.560 --> 17:25.560]  So while you still can, because any day can be our last broadcast,
[17:25.560 --> 17:28.560]  spread the word about the show, share the article, share the videos,
[17:28.560 --> 17:30.560]  and please, fund us.

[17:52.560 --> 17:54.560]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[17:54.560 --> 17:58.560]  Now spread the word, my friends, we're involved in an epic, historic battle.
[17:58.560 --> 18:02.560]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family,
[18:02.560 --> 18:06.560]  to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate our marriages.
[18:06.560 --> 18:08.560]  And the studies are all clear.
[18:08.560 --> 18:14.560]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom.
[18:14.560 --> 18:18.560]  And the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[18:18.560 --> 18:21.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this,
[18:21.560 --> 18:24.560]  because they don't want people having lasting, good, loving relationships.
[18:24.560 --> 18:26.560]  They want to break up society.
[18:26.560 --> 18:32.560]  And we are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill
[18:32.560 --> 18:35.560]  in the world, available as a major sponsor now.

[18:43.560 --> 18:45.560]  and then get a bottle of InstaHeart.
[18:45.560 --> 18:48.560]  It's discreet shipping. I've used it. It's amazing.

[18:50.560 --> 18:52.560]  This also enhances it.
[18:52.560 --> 19:06.560]  So again, get yours today at theironpatriot.com.
[19:41.560 --> 19:45.560]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL,
[19:45.560 --> 20:00.560]  Just know what else you can do about it.
[20:15.560 --> 20:19.560]  You know it's me when I come through your town
[20:19.560 --> 20:22.560]  I'm gonna ride around in style
[20:22.560 --> 20:25.560]  I'm gonna drive everybody wild
[20:25.560 --> 20:29.560]  Cause I'll have the only one there is around
[20:29.560 --> 20:32.560]  So the very next day when I punched in
[20:32.560 --> 20:35.560]  With my big lunchbox with help from my friend
[20:35.560 --> 20:38.560]  I left that day with a lunchbox full of kids
[20:38.560 --> 20:41.560]  I've never considered myself a thief
[20:41.560 --> 20:44.560]  But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
[20:44.560 --> 20:48.560]  Especially if I strung it out over several years
[20:48.560 --> 20:51.560]  The first day I got me a fuel pump
[20:51.560 --> 20:54.560]  And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
[20:54.560 --> 20:57.560]  Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome
[20:57.560 --> 21:00.560]  The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
[21:00.560 --> 21:03.560]  Like nuts and bolts and all four shocks
[21:03.560 --> 21:07.560]  But the big stuff we snuck out my buddy's mobile home
[21:07.560 --> 21:10.560]  Now up to now my plan went alright
[21:10.560 --> 21:12.560]  Till we tried to put it all together one night
[21:12.560 --> 21:16.560]  And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong
[21:16.560 --> 21:19.560]  The transmission was a 53
[21:19.560 --> 21:21.560]  And the motor turned out to be a 73
[21:21.560 --> 21:25.560]  And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone
[21:25.560 --> 21:28.560]  So we drilled it out so that it would fit
[21:28.560 --> 21:31.560]  And with a little bit of help from an 8 out the kit
[21:31.560 --> 21:35.560]  We had that engine running just like a song
[21:35.560 --> 21:37.560]  Now the headlights, there was another side
[21:37.560 --> 21:40.560]  We had two on the left and one on the right
[21:40.560 --> 21:44.560]  But when we pulled out the switch all three of them come on
[21:44.560 --> 21:47.560]  The back end looked kinda funny too
[21:47.560 --> 21:49.560]  But we put it together and when we got through
[21:49.560 --> 21:53.560]  Well that's when we noticed that we only had one tailpin
[21:53.560 --> 21:56.560]  About that time my wife walked out
[21:56.560 --> 21:58.560]  And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
[21:58.560 --> 22:00.560]  But she opened the door and said
[22:00.560 --> 22:03.560]  Honey, take me for a spin
[22:03.560 --> 22:05.560]  So we drove up town just to get the tag
[22:05.560 --> 22:08.560]  And I hid her to ride on the downed main track
[22:08.560 --> 22:12.560]  I could hear everybody laughing for blocks and runs
[22:12.560 --> 22:14.560]  But up there at the courthouse they didn't laugh
[22:14.560 --> 22:17.560]  Cause to type it up it took the whole staff
[22:17.560 --> 22:21.560]  And when they got through the title weighed 60 pounds
[22:21.560 --> 22:24.560]  I got it for one piece at a time
[22:24.560 --> 22:26.560]  And it didn't cost me a dime
[22:26.560 --> 22:30.560]  You know it's me when I come through your town
[22:30.560 --> 22:33.560]  I'm gonna ride around in style
[22:33.560 --> 22:35.560]  I'm gonna drive everybody wild
[22:35.560 --> 22:39.560]  Cause I'll have the only one there is around
[22:39.560 --> 22:41.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back
[22:41.560 --> 22:44.560]  Uh, yeah, red rider, this is...
[22:44.560 --> 22:45.560]  That's how my weird brain works
[22:45.560 --> 22:47.560]  I was thinking about this virus
[22:47.560 --> 22:49.560]  They mixed all together and created
[22:49.560 --> 22:51.560]  That anybody can look at who's a scientist
[22:51.560 --> 22:54.560]  Who studies this and tell you it's totally man-made
[22:54.560 --> 22:57.560]  Now they censored us 30 plus months ago
[22:57.560 --> 22:59.560]  In January and February of 2020
[22:59.560 --> 23:04.560]  When I had these men that wrote the U.S. Biological Weapons Law
[23:04.560 --> 23:07.560]  And wrote the U.N. Biological Weapons Law
[23:07.560 --> 23:09.560]  Dr. Francis Boyle
[23:09.560 --> 23:11.560]  And he was already talking to scientists then
[23:11.560 --> 23:12.560]  That told him it was man-made
[23:12.560 --> 23:15.560]  But then a month later it came out it was
[23:15.560 --> 23:18.560]  They got it one piece at a time
[23:18.560 --> 23:21.560]  And they charged the taxpayers to build it
[23:21.560 --> 23:23.560]  And it was all Obama and the globalist
[23:23.560 --> 23:25.560]  At Chapel Hill, North Carolina
[23:25.560 --> 23:27.560]  That were already making this thing in 2015
[23:27.560 --> 23:29.560]  It was a huge scandal
[23:29.560 --> 23:31.560]  The scientists there said this is wrong
[23:31.560 --> 23:33.560]  Shut this down, it's gain of function
[23:33.560 --> 23:35.560]  There were mainstream news articles
[23:35.560 --> 23:38.560]  And major scientific publications
[23:38.560 --> 23:41.560]  So they moved the damn laboratories
[23:41.560 --> 23:45.560]  To Luhanshina and to...
[23:45.560 --> 23:50.560]  How do you pronounce it? Krakow Ukraine
[23:50.560 --> 23:53.560]  We're putting articles on screen for TV viewers
[23:53.560 --> 23:55.560]  And now they got the head of the land's investigation
[23:55.560 --> 23:57.560]  Saying it came from a lab
[23:57.560 --> 23:59.560]  They can look at it under a super microscope
[23:59.560 --> 24:01.560]  And under their CRISPR analyzing system
[24:01.560 --> 24:04.560]  That tells them exactly what it is
[24:04.560 --> 24:06.560]  A Frankenstein virus
[24:06.560 --> 24:09.560]  Their term is chimera
[24:09.560 --> 24:11.560]  Now I got hundreds of articles here
[24:11.560 --> 24:13.560]  But I'm here to tell you the big news
[24:13.560 --> 24:15.560]  Is those Senate hearings they had last week
[24:15.560 --> 24:17.560]  Were more of this came out
[24:17.560 --> 24:20.560]  This could kill billions of people
[24:20.560 --> 24:22.560]  This could destroy civilization
[24:22.560 --> 24:25.560]  This, what they released is just a highly communicable
[24:25.560 --> 24:28.560]  Really bad cold, they've got things far worse
[24:28.560 --> 24:31.560]  At a course, Bill Gates, Peter Dazik, Anthony Fauci
[24:31.560 --> 24:33.560]  Were all up to their eyeballs
[24:33.560 --> 24:35.560]  Quarterbacking the whole thing
[24:35.560 --> 24:37.560]  But they're the good guys the corporate media tells us
[24:37.560 --> 24:39.560]  They're the angels
[24:39.560 --> 24:42.560]  I'm the bad guy for questioning WMDs in Iraq
[24:42.560 --> 24:46.560]  And Jesse Smollett and...
[24:46.560 --> 24:48.560]  These white supremacist groups run around the country
[24:48.560 --> 24:49.560]  Where it's now been confirmed
[24:49.560 --> 24:51.560]  Almost all of them are leftist groups
[24:51.560 --> 24:53.560]  Dressed up like Nazis
[24:53.560 --> 24:56.560]  Hell, even the group that went to TPUSA
[24:56.560 --> 24:58.560]  And tried to infiltrate their organization
[24:58.560 --> 25:00.560]  Turned out to be Antifa
[25:00.560 --> 25:01.560]  Dressed up like Nazis
[25:01.560 --> 25:03.560]  But didn't stop Whoopi Goldberg in the view
[25:03.560 --> 25:07.560]  For saying Turning Point USA are a bunch of Nazis
[25:07.560 --> 25:10.560]  We just questioned some of these events
[25:10.560 --> 25:12.560]  We're bad, we're the worst ever
[25:12.560 --> 25:14.560]  And we're horrible people
[25:17.560 --> 25:18.560]  I questioned you, Valde
[25:18.560 --> 25:20.560]  Hell, the state police says there's a cover-up
[25:20.560 --> 25:22.560]  The mayor says there's a cover-up
[25:22.560 --> 25:24.560]  In fact, it's sitting right out there
[25:24.560 --> 25:26.560]  On the door on that pile of articles from last Friday
[25:26.560 --> 25:27.560]  Right on the top is
[25:27.560 --> 25:29.560]  You've all the mayor fears there's a cover-up
[25:29.560 --> 25:32.560]  Is he going to get sued?
[25:32.560 --> 25:35.560]  When you have a system that lies continually
[25:35.560 --> 25:37.560]  And stages events and provocateurs events
[25:37.560 --> 25:40.560]  We have a right and a duty to question it
[25:40.560 --> 25:43.560]  And we were right about gaining a function
[25:43.560 --> 25:45.560]  We were right about where the virus was made
[25:45.560 --> 25:47.560]  We were right about this
[25:47.560 --> 25:49.560]  We're not the ones endangering world peace
[25:49.560 --> 25:53.560]  And the world population
[25:53.560 --> 25:56.560]  We're not the ones
[25:56.560 --> 25:59.560]  It's right when you walk out the door
[25:59.560 --> 26:02.560]  Right to the left is the stack of my articles from Friday
[26:02.560 --> 26:04.560]  I saw it this morning, I forgot to bring it in here
[26:04.560 --> 26:08.560]  It's right there on the top
[26:08.560 --> 26:10.560]  But just think about that
[26:10.560 --> 26:13.560]  They demonize us as if we're the bad guys
[26:13.560 --> 26:15.560]  Because they see us as the populist
[26:15.560 --> 26:17.560]  They see us as you
[26:17.560 --> 26:19.560]  Yeah, there it is, Axios
[26:19.560 --> 26:21.560]  It links to all the local newspapers
[26:21.560 --> 26:23.560]  You've all the mayor says he fears cover-up
[26:23.560 --> 26:27.560]  Of deadly shooting
[26:27.560 --> 26:30.560]  At you've all the school
[26:30.560 --> 26:33.560]  Well, I guess he's going to have to be on trial
[26:33.560 --> 26:36.560]  Never said the names of the people that sued me
[26:36.560 --> 26:38.560]  Under Texas law, you can't sue somebody
[26:38.560 --> 26:39.560]  If you haven't said their name
[26:39.560 --> 26:42.560]  But it was all personal, they said
[26:42.560 --> 26:46.560]  But in their closing arguments, I'll play later
[26:46.560 --> 26:47.560]  They said we want to silence him
[26:47.560 --> 26:49.560]  And take his platform away
[26:49.560 --> 26:51.560]  And we want to intimidate other people
[26:51.560 --> 26:53.560]  To never question official narratives
[26:53.560 --> 26:55.560]  It's like a joke, the things they say
[26:55.560 --> 26:57.560]  It's so authoritarian, it's so naked
[26:57.560 --> 26:59.560]  But that's where they are
[26:59.560 --> 27:02.560]  Because they're losing control
[27:02.560 --> 27:05.560]  So people ask how I'm doing
[27:05.560 --> 27:07.560]  I was on the war room
[27:07.560 --> 27:09.560]  Not our war room with our lawyer
[27:09.560 --> 27:11.560]  Three to six p.m.
[27:11.560 --> 27:12.560]  I was on that too
[27:12.560 --> 27:15.560]  But I was on Steve Bannon again this morning
[27:15.560 --> 27:17.560]  With Eric Prince of all people
[27:17.560 --> 27:19.560]  Who were killed
[27:19.560 --> 27:21.560]  And
[27:21.560 --> 27:24.560]  A Twilight Zone episode
[27:24.560 --> 27:26.560]  I'll leave it at that
[27:26.560 --> 27:29.560]  And
[27:29.560 --> 27:32.560]  Bannon's like, are you going to continue your fight?
[27:32.560 --> 27:34.560]  I'm like, absolutely
[27:34.560 --> 27:36.560]  It's one of the real numbers, one of the real facts
[27:36.560 --> 27:38.560]  And I did a presentation
[27:38.560 --> 27:39.560]  And that made me think
[27:39.560 --> 27:41.560]  My own family keeps asking what's going on
[27:41.560 --> 27:43.560]  My own crew keeps asking what's going on
[27:43.560 --> 27:46.560]  So at one o'clock today
[27:46.560 --> 27:48.560]  I'm going to go over all of this
[27:48.560 --> 27:49.560]  And spend some time on it
[27:49.560 --> 27:51.560]  And tell you exactly where Info Wars is
[27:51.560 --> 27:54.560]  Because I just filed in bankruptcy
[27:54.560 --> 27:57.560]  Our statement of assets and money
[27:57.560 --> 27:59.560]  And it's under penalty of perjury
[27:59.560 --> 28:01.560]  So if anything
[28:01.560 --> 28:03.560]  It's probably too good a projection
[28:03.560 --> 28:05.560]  We want to show everything we've actually got
[28:05.560 --> 28:07.560]  It's the best truth we can come up with
[28:07.560 --> 28:09.560]  With the finances and stuff
[28:09.560 --> 28:11.560]  You never know down to the penny
[28:11.560 --> 28:13.560]  But I personally think
[28:13.560 --> 28:15.560]  Some of the things I own are overvalued
[28:15.560 --> 28:17.560]  So we're not going to undervalue these
[28:17.560 --> 28:19.560]  And
[28:19.560 --> 28:21.560]  It's just insane
[28:21.560 --> 28:24.560]  To be down to almost nothing
[28:24.560 --> 28:26.560]  And to sit there
[28:26.560 --> 28:28.560]  I'm going to just say this and get on to other news
[28:28.560 --> 28:30.560]  I'll cover it more in the third hour
[28:30.560 --> 28:32.560]  But I've got a
[28:32.560 --> 28:34.560]  Really great team of people
[28:34.560 --> 28:36.560]  Despite what the media says
[28:36.560 --> 28:38.560]  And they've just never seen anything like it
[28:38.560 --> 28:40.560]  They barred me from
[28:40.560 --> 28:42.560]  Testifying on my assets
[28:42.560 --> 28:45.560]  And had some quack up there and say I got $270 million
[28:45.560 --> 28:47.560]  So they had the jury go
[28:47.560 --> 28:49.560]  Well, $45 million had nothing for him
[28:52.560 --> 28:54.560]  And the judge let him do it
[28:54.560 --> 28:56.560]  But she did more than that
[28:56.560 --> 28:58.560]  Stay with us
[28:59.560 --> 29:01.560]  The great reset in the war for the world
[29:01.560 --> 29:04.560]  Is the book that the government doesn't want you to read
[29:04.560 --> 29:07.560]  That most of the big powerful companies
[29:07.560 --> 29:09.560]  Trying to control your life
[29:09.560 --> 29:10.560]  The big tech companies
[29:10.560 --> 29:12.560]  They don't want you to read this book
[29:12.560 --> 29:14.560]  They want to control what you think
[29:14.560 --> 29:16.560]  What you do, what you read
[29:16.560 --> 29:18.560]  But you don't want that
[29:18.560 --> 29:20.560]  And Alex Jones doesn't want that
[29:20.560 --> 29:22.560]  And this book shows you what's happening
[29:22.560 --> 29:24.560]  And gives you the sort of playbook
[29:24.560 --> 29:26.560]  For how to fight against it
[29:26.560 --> 29:28.560]  And so by buying this book
[29:28.560 --> 29:30.560]  You're going to prove that censorship doesn't work
[29:30.560 --> 29:32.560]  That freedom is alive in this country
[29:32.560 --> 29:34.560]  This is essential reading
[29:34.560 --> 29:36.560]  And I would go right now
[29:36.560 --> 29:38.560]  And buy it before the censorship kicks in
[29:38.560 --> 29:40.560]  It's not going to be available in bookstores
[29:40.560 --> 29:42.560]  It's not going to be available in libraries
[29:42.560 --> 29:44.560]  They're going to try to take it down
[29:44.560 --> 29:46.560]  From every platform that they can
[29:46.560 --> 29:48.560]  But they're not going to be able to do it
[29:48.560 --> 29:50.560]  Prove that censorship doesn't work
[29:50.560 --> 29:51.560]  Buy the great reset
[29:51.560 --> 29:52.560]  Thank you, Alex Jones
[29:52.560 --> 29:54.560]  I really appreciate you having me on

[31:53.560 --> 31:56.560]  With Bodies ultimate turmeric formula
[31:58.560 --> 31:59.560]  The globalists are fighting
[31:59.560 --> 32:02.560]  Around the clock to destroy the family
[32:02.560 --> 32:04.560]  To destroy heterosexual relationships
[32:04.560 --> 32:06.560]  To annihilate our marriages
[32:06.560 --> 32:08.560]  And the studies are all clear
[32:08.560 --> 32:11.560]  The number one cause of marital splits
[32:11.560 --> 32:14.560]  Is that there is problems in the bedroom
[32:14.560 --> 32:16.560]  And the number one issue men have
[32:16.560 --> 32:18.560]  Is erectile dysfunction
[32:18.560 --> 32:19.560]  Ladies and gentlemen
[32:19.560 --> 32:21.560]  The left makes big jokes about this
[32:21.560 --> 32:23.560]  Because they don't want people having
[32:23.560 --> 32:25.560]  Lasting, good, loving relationships
[32:25.560 --> 32:27.560]  They want to break up society

[32:48.560 --> 32:49.560]  It's amazing
[32:49.560 --> 32:51.560]  It's not just for folks that have problems in the bedroom

[33:25.560 --> 33:28.560]  It's Alex Jones
[33:28.560 --> 33:30.560]  So everybody knows about the spectacle
[33:30.560 --> 33:32.560]  The last few months
[33:32.560 --> 33:36.560]  Greg Abbott actually did something good
[33:36.560 --> 33:38.560]  He started shipping illegal aliens
[33:38.560 --> 33:40.560]  Pouring in by the millions
[33:40.560 --> 33:42.560]  Just a few
[33:42.560 --> 33:44.560]  Tens of thousands
[33:44.560 --> 33:46.560]  To DC and New York
[33:46.560 --> 33:49.560]  And the race-baiting leftist mayor
[33:49.560 --> 33:50.560]  Eric Adams
[33:50.560 --> 33:52.560]  How he responded was
[33:52.560 --> 33:55.560]  So cliche of leftist
[33:55.560 --> 33:57.560]  They want to flood the country
[33:57.560 --> 34:00.560]  With people who don't have jobs or a future in crime
[34:00.560 --> 34:04.560]  But they don't want it in their backyard
[34:04.560 --> 34:07.560]  This is a real burden on New Yorkers
[34:07.560 --> 34:09.560]  As we're trying to do the right thing
[34:09.560 --> 34:11.560]  We already, as I stated
[34:11.560 --> 34:14.560]  We already have an overburdened shelter system
[34:14.560 --> 34:16.560]  So now we're talking about
[34:16.560 --> 34:19.560]  As you stated, food, clothing, school
[34:19.560 --> 34:23.560]  Is going to impact our schools
[34:23.560 --> 34:26.560]  Because we do not turn away individuals
[34:26.560 --> 34:28.560]  Because they're undocumented
[34:28.560 --> 34:29.560]  Translation services
[34:29.560 --> 34:31.560]  There's just a whole host of things
[34:31.560 --> 34:33.560]  That this is going to produce
[34:33.560 --> 34:35.560]  And that's why we need help
[34:35.560 --> 34:36.560]  And getting this done
[34:36.560 --> 34:38.560]  And we need to write coordination to make it happen
[34:38.560 --> 34:42.560]  And we can't have the historical
[34:42.560 --> 34:44.560]  I believe people should be housed
[34:44.560 --> 34:47.560]  But just don't house them on my block
[34:47.560 --> 34:51.560]  Everyone's block is going to be impacted by this
[34:51.560 --> 34:56.560]  And so we have to add our advocacy
[34:56.560 --> 34:59.560]  With our ability to help our neighbors
[34:59.560 --> 35:02.560]  And we need everyone on board with this
[35:02.560 --> 35:04.560]  Because as I stated last week
[35:04.560 --> 35:06.560]  Our schools are going to be impacted
[35:06.560 --> 35:09.560]  Our healthcare system is going to be impacted
[35:09.560 --> 35:12.560]  Our infrastructure is going to be impacted
[35:12.560 --> 35:14.560]  But we're willing to do our job
[35:14.560 --> 35:16.560]  And we're going to do our job
[35:16.560 --> 35:18.560]  And we're going to need all New Yorkers
[35:18.560 --> 35:20.560]  To be with us on this
[35:20.560 --> 35:23.560]  We've got the DC Mayor saying
[35:23.560 --> 35:25.560]  Stop it right now and call him to the National Guard
[35:25.560 --> 35:27.560]  He went on to say this is horrific
[35:27.560 --> 35:29.560]  New York City Mayor Blast Abbott
[35:29.560 --> 35:31.560]  Blames him after another bus
[35:31.560 --> 35:33.560]  The illegal immigrants arrive
[35:33.560 --> 35:34.560]  We have those clips as well
[35:34.560 --> 35:35.560]  We'll play here in a few minutes
[35:35.560 --> 35:38.560]  But think about this
[35:38.560 --> 35:41.560]  Biden tells the world come here
[35:41.560 --> 35:43.560]  They have the border patrols staying down
[35:43.560 --> 35:45.560]  Millions are coming across every few months
[35:45.560 --> 35:50.560]  It's part of the UN replacement migration plan
[35:50.560 --> 35:54.560]  And the Democrats don't like it actually happening to them
[35:54.560 --> 35:57.560]  This is how you fight fire with fire
[35:57.560 --> 35:59.560]  Here's Greg Abbott
[35:59.560 --> 36:01.560]  They wanted to complain about it
[36:01.560 --> 36:03.560]  About what they're having to grapple with
[36:03.560 --> 36:05.560]  But I wanted them to come to the border
[36:05.560 --> 36:08.560]  And see for themselves the magnitude of the problem
[36:08.560 --> 36:10.560]  That we're having at the border
[36:10.560 --> 36:12.560]  We've sent more than 6,000 people by bus
[36:12.560 --> 36:14.560]  To Washington DC
[36:14.560 --> 36:17.560]  We have that many people coming across the Del Rio sector
[36:17.560 --> 36:18.560]  Every single day
[36:18.560 --> 36:19.560]  Every day
[36:19.560 --> 36:21.560]  And they need to see firsthand what we're having to deal with
[36:21.560 --> 36:25.560]  I think if we could educate more leaders across this country
[36:25.560 --> 36:28.560]  About the chaos caused by the Biden administration
[36:28.560 --> 36:31.560]  That would compel the Biden administration to finally step up
[36:31.560 --> 36:34.560]  And do its job under the Constitution
[36:34.560 --> 36:36.560]  And enforce the immigration laws
[36:36.560 --> 36:38.560]  That have been passed by Congress
[36:39.560 --> 36:40.560]  You heard Eric Adams
[36:40.560 --> 36:42.560]  He said it's weighing down our schools
[36:42.560 --> 36:43.560]  It's weighing down our infrastructure
[36:43.560 --> 36:44.560]  We...
[36:44.560 --> 36:48.560]  Well, what do you think it's like for Texas and Arizona?
[36:48.560 --> 36:51.560]  What do you think it's like for the average American?
[36:51.560 --> 36:54.560]  The U.N. turns off the food, turns off the water
[36:54.560 --> 36:56.560]  Only people work for two years in the third world
[36:56.560 --> 36:58.560]  Their lockdown wasn't six, eight months like here
[36:58.560 --> 37:00.560]  Or a year and a half like in California
[37:00.560 --> 37:04.560]  It was over two years long
[37:04.560 --> 37:06.560]  So I don't blame these poor people
[37:06.560 --> 37:08.560]  In fact, they've done polls, international groups have
[37:08.560 --> 37:09.560]  Why are you here?
[37:09.560 --> 37:11.560]  93% in one big poll said
[37:11.560 --> 37:13.560]  We can't work where we live
[37:13.560 --> 37:15.560]  Our farm is shut down
[37:15.560 --> 37:18.560]  We work on a farm because no one can buy the produce
[37:18.560 --> 37:20.560]  Because we're locked down
[37:21.560 --> 37:24.560]  They had to slaughter the milk cows all over the world
[37:24.560 --> 37:26.560]  Because nobody was pumping the milk
[37:26.560 --> 37:28.560]  And you go, why'd you kill the cows?
[37:28.560 --> 37:29.560]  You got to feed them?
[37:31.560 --> 37:34.560]  They're destroying hundreds of years of infrastructure
[37:34.560 --> 37:37.560]  That our ancestors and that we built up
[37:37.560 --> 37:40.560]  They're just annihilating us
[37:40.560 --> 37:45.560]  And then the Democrats tell small businesses
[37:45.560 --> 37:48.560]  They're not essential and individuals are not essential
[37:51.560 --> 37:53.560]  And their new Inflation Reduction Act
[37:53.560 --> 37:55.560]  That every economist says will increase inflation
[37:55.560 --> 37:57.560]  That I've seen out there
[37:57.560 --> 37:58.560]  Of course it will
[37:58.560 --> 38:02.560]  Increases IRS ages by 87,000 employees
[38:02.560 --> 38:06.560]  It's simply incredible
[38:06.560 --> 38:07.560]  Incredible
[38:08.560 --> 38:11.560]  Let's look at some of the inflation numbers here
[38:13.560 --> 38:15.560]  Then we're going to open the phones up and look at
[38:15.560 --> 38:17.560]  The incredible developments they don't want you to know about
[38:17.560 --> 38:19.560]  In Ukraine next segment
[38:20.560 --> 38:21.560]  We already played the clip earlier
[38:21.560 --> 38:23.560]  But let's play it one more time, clip four
[38:24.560 --> 38:27.560]  Democrats cheer and clap like seals
[38:27.560 --> 38:30.560]  After they pass a bill to raise taxes on little class
[38:30.560 --> 38:33.560]  Raise inflation across small businesses
[38:33.560 --> 38:35.560]  During Biden's economic recession
[38:35.560 --> 38:37.560]  50, the nays are 50
[38:37.560 --> 38:39.560]  The Senate being equally divided
[38:39.560 --> 38:42.560]  The Vice President votes in the affirmative
[38:42.560 --> 38:45.560]  And the bill, as amended, is passed
[38:48.560 --> 38:51.560]  Only they could be more disgusting if she added a little witch-cackle
[38:54.560 --> 38:55.560]  And it just goes on and on
[38:59.560 --> 39:03.560]  Democrats hired 87,000 more IRS employees to harass
[39:03.560 --> 39:04.560]  Attack Americans
[39:04.560 --> 39:07.560]  Here's a list of the conservative groups the Obama IRS targeted
[39:07.560 --> 39:09.560]  In 2012
[39:10.560 --> 39:12.560]  With lowest learner
[39:13.560 --> 39:16.560]  Every single Senate Democrat voted
[39:20.560 --> 39:23.560]  Against defining pregnancy as a biological female process
[39:25.560 --> 39:27.560]  Again, it's a war on logic
[39:27.560 --> 39:31.560]  Republicans warn Democrats will pay the price for spending bill
[39:31.560 --> 39:33.560]  How about Americans will pay the price?
[39:35.560 --> 39:38.560]  And even Bernie Sanders came out and said it will increase
[39:39.560 --> 39:41.560]  Inflation, not decrease it
[39:42.560 --> 39:46.560]  But the really scary parts are the energy cuts
[39:46.560 --> 39:48.560]  And attacks on U.S. infrastructure
[39:49.560 --> 39:53.560]  That throws a wet blanket on an already sputtering, collapsing economy
[39:56.560 --> 39:59.560]  Alright, I want to open the phones up for first-time callers today
[39:59.560 --> 40:02.560]  On any issue you want to discuss
[40:02.560 --> 40:05.560]  Any topic we've raised, any topic you want to raise
[40:05.560 --> 40:08.560]  We don't screen your calls other than tell us your name
[40:08.560 --> 40:10.560]  And where you're calling from if you'd like to
[40:10.560 --> 40:13.560]  And the topic so I know who I'm going to
[40:13.560 --> 40:15.560]  So I'm ready to respond to your question or comment
[40:15.560 --> 40:17.560]  You agree, you disagree
[40:17.560 --> 40:19.560]  We're not censoring your calls here
[40:19.560 --> 40:23.560]  I love to hear opposition and hear what you have to say as well
[40:23.560 --> 40:27.560]  So if you've got the brass eggs
[40:27.560 --> 40:30.560]  The Cajones to call in
[40:30.560 --> 40:33.560]  I'd love to hear from folks that disagree as well
[40:33.560 --> 40:35.560]  But there are a bunch of cowards
[40:35.560 --> 40:37.560]  They usually only do it on their terms and their turf
[40:37.560 --> 40:39.560]  But they can be deceptive
[40:39.560 --> 40:43.560]  Or live, what you say will be heard by the world
[40:43.560 --> 40:47.560]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539
[40:47.560 --> 40:49.560]  877-789-2539
[40:49.560 --> 40:52.560]  877-789-Alex
[40:52.560 --> 40:57.560]  And we will take your calls at 877-789-2539
[40:57.560 --> 40:59.560]  Coming up
[40:59.560 --> 41:03.560]  Let me just say this to the viewers and listeners
[41:03.560 --> 41:05.560]  You've asked me whether we'll stay on air
[41:05.560 --> 41:08.560]  That's really up to you
[41:08.560 --> 41:11.560]  The media's been very deceptive with the $45 million
[41:11.560 --> 41:14.560]  Judgment
[41:14.560 --> 41:16.560]  And all the things they said and did
[41:16.560 --> 41:19.560]  Under Texas law it's capped at like $5.6 million
[41:19.560 --> 41:21.560]  That's the good news
[41:21.560 --> 41:23.560]  The bad news is
[41:23.560 --> 41:26.560]  Everything the company has and that I personally have
[41:26.560 --> 41:30.560]  As of cash is about $2 million
[41:30.560 --> 41:33.560]  Paying payroll, keeping the lights on, doing all that
[41:33.560 --> 41:38.560]  $2 million is running on fumes, if not out of gas
[41:38.560 --> 41:40.560]  But
[41:40.560 --> 41:42.560]  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
[41:42.560 --> 41:45.560]  We had massive
[41:45.560 --> 41:47.560]  Orders
[41:47.560 --> 41:49.560]  At infowarstore.com
[41:49.560 --> 41:52.560]  And because we got some new, bigger, better companies
[41:52.560 --> 41:55.560]  To produce our products and the stuff's coming in
[41:55.560 --> 41:57.560]  We can project forward and say
[41:57.560 --> 42:00.560]  If you continue to support
[42:00.560 --> 42:02.560]  We're gonna have the money
[42:02.560 --> 42:05.560]  For our appeals and for our fights
[42:05.560 --> 42:07.560]  For years to come
[42:07.560 --> 42:12.560]  But right now we need you to go to infowarstore.com
[42:12.560 --> 42:15.560]  Info Wars is literally
[42:15.560 --> 42:16.560]  In your hands
[42:16.560 --> 42:18.560]  And the enemy hates this broadcast
[42:18.560 --> 42:20.560]  They hate our populism
[42:20.560 --> 42:21.560]  They hate the fact we're pro-life
[42:21.560 --> 42:23.560]  They hate the fact we're pro-gun
[42:23.560 --> 42:25.560]  They hate the fact that we wrote the book
[42:25.560 --> 42:27.560]  On lazing the target
[42:27.560 --> 42:29.560]  And exposing the globalist
[42:29.560 --> 42:30.560]  And how they operate and who they are
[42:30.560 --> 42:31.560]  So they want us all fair
[42:31.560 --> 42:33.560]  Well, I don't intend to go all fair
[42:33.560 --> 42:35.560]  But I am in your hands
[42:35.560 --> 42:36.560]  So thank you for your past support
[42:36.560 --> 42:39.560]  And I would encourage you to pray about it
[42:39.560 --> 42:40.560]  And decide to take action
[42:40.560 --> 42:43.560]  And buy as much high quality products as you can
[42:43.560 --> 42:44.560]  At infowarstore.com
[42:44.560 --> 42:47.560]  We had a lot of donations coming over the weekend
[42:47.560 --> 42:48.560]  At infowarstore.com
[42:48.560 --> 42:50.560]  There's a banner up there saying
[42:50.560 --> 42:51.560]  On the tip of the spear
[42:51.560 --> 42:54.560]  Thank you for keeping all of us together in the fight
[42:54.560 --> 42:56.560]  You are amazing
[42:59.560 --> 43:00.560]  People say Alex Jones is crazy
[43:00.560 --> 43:02.560]  He's a conspiracy theory guy
[43:02.560 --> 43:03.560]  He's a nutcase
[43:03.560 --> 43:05.560]  He's got these rants and all that
[43:05.560 --> 43:09.560]  What they miss is that this guy's a head of the curve
[43:09.560 --> 43:12.560]  On so many different topics of signal
[43:12.560 --> 43:13.560]  Not noise
[43:13.560 --> 43:14.560]  If you look at the signal
[43:14.560 --> 43:16.560]  And you compare that
[43:16.560 --> 43:19.560]  To PBS and NPR and BBC
[43:19.560 --> 43:21.560]  And we'll do what Alex Jones put out there
[43:21.560 --> 43:24.560]  Versus what your collective body has put out there
[43:24.560 --> 43:26.560]  And if you're sitting in a human being
[43:26.560 --> 43:27.560]  And just watching it
[43:27.560 --> 43:29.560]  You say, well, Alex Jones is the head of this
[43:29.560 --> 43:30.560]  Not only that, he kind of explained it
[43:30.560 --> 43:33.560]  You are one of the great thinkers of this
[43:33.560 --> 43:34.560]  That is very rare
[43:34.560 --> 43:37.560]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation
[43:37.560 --> 43:38.560]  And see that
[43:38.560 --> 43:40.560]  In this new book, I've got to tell you
[43:40.560 --> 43:41.560]  When Tony Lyons first approached me
[43:41.560 --> 43:42.560]  I read this thing
[43:42.560 --> 43:43.560]  I go, this is it
[43:43.560 --> 43:45.560]  This is no beach reef
[43:45.560 --> 43:47.560]  You're not going to be flipping pages here
[43:47.560 --> 43:48.560]  You're going to be having a pin out
[43:48.560 --> 43:49.560]  And you're going to be underlying stuff
[43:49.560 --> 43:52.560]  The Great Reset by Alex Jones
[43:52.560 --> 43:55.560]  Order your copy now at Amazon
[43:55.560 --> 43:58.560]  Or infowarstore.com
[43:58.560 --> 44:00.560]  Several years ago
[44:00.560 --> 44:03.560]  I approached one of the top companies in the U.S.
[44:03.560 --> 44:05.560]  That supplies the highest quality signature
[44:05.560 --> 44:08.560]  Reducing Faraday cages to the Pentagon
[44:08.560 --> 44:10.560]  And other U.S. government agencies
[44:10.560 --> 44:13.560]  And now they have produced specifically for us
[44:13.560 --> 44:15.560]  This made in America
[44:15.560 --> 44:18.560]  A high-end line at a very affordable price
[44:18.560 --> 44:21.560]  Whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone
[44:21.560 --> 44:23.560]  Or big pouches that protect laptops
[44:23.560 --> 44:25.560]  And iPads or big bags
[44:25.560 --> 44:27.560]  That promote whatever electronics you want to put in it
[44:27.560 --> 44:29.560]  Like desktop computers
[44:29.560 --> 44:31.560]  It is all exclusively available
[44:31.560 --> 44:33.560]  At infowarstore.com
[44:33.560 --> 44:35.560]  Under the Redux name

[44:39.560 --> 44:41.560]  And bringing them directly to you
[44:41.560 --> 44:43.560]  At infowarstore.com
[44:43.560 --> 44:45.560]  In this insane world
[44:45.560 --> 44:47.560]  You are crazy
[44:47.560 --> 44:49.560]  If you don't protect your signature
[44:49.560 --> 44:51.560]  From identity theft
[44:51.560 --> 44:53.560]  Hackers, criminals, corporations, governments
[44:53.560 --> 44:55.560]  This is one of the hottest items out there today
[44:55.560 --> 44:57.560]  That's exclusively available
[44:57.560 --> 44:59.560]  At infowarstore.com
[44:59.560 --> 45:01.560]  We brought the game-changing product
[45:01.560 --> 45:03.560]  Previously only available to major oil companies
[45:03.560 --> 45:05.560]  Around the world
[45:05.560 --> 45:07.560]  To the civilian market two years ago
[45:07.560 --> 45:09.560]  The Biopros
[45:09.560 --> 45:11.560]  For RVs, for your drains
[45:11.560 --> 45:13.560]  Your boats, it goes on and on
[45:13.560 --> 45:15.560]  It will eat the oil off of your driveway
[45:15.560 --> 45:17.560]  If you just add water
[45:17.560 --> 45:19.560]  But it's been so successful now
[45:19.560 --> 45:21.560]  We're selling it to major RV parks
[45:21.560 --> 45:23.560]  Pig farms, you name it
[45:23.560 --> 45:25.560]  Because this stuff will eat
[45:25.560 --> 45:27.560]  Anything that is organic
[45:27.560 --> 45:29.560]  And it's exclusively available
[45:29.560 --> 45:31.560]  At thebiopros.com
[45:31.560 --> 45:33.560]  And now

[45:35.560 --> 45:37.560]  We sold out of this for almost a year
[45:37.560 --> 45:39.560]  A major purchase and it is now

[46:53.560 --> 46:55.560]  Thank you so much for joining us
[46:55.560 --> 46:57.560]  Spread the word my friends
[46:57.560 --> 47:23.560]  In this historic battle
[47:23.560 --> 47:25.560]  So it's now about 100 billion dollars
[47:25.560 --> 47:27.560]  In just the last
[47:27.560 --> 47:29.560]  Eight months
[47:29.560 --> 47:31.560]  That's been pumped into Ukraine
[47:31.560 --> 47:33.560]  For this proxy war with Russia
[47:33.560 --> 47:35.560]  And
[47:35.560 --> 47:37.560]  The reason the globalists don't like me is
[47:37.560 --> 47:39.560]  I'm not one of them
[47:39.560 --> 47:41.560]  But I'm able to think like they do
[47:41.560 --> 47:43.560]  And see what they're really up to
[47:43.560 --> 47:45.560]  Just like you can
[47:45.560 --> 47:47.560]  I don't have the corner on that market
[47:47.560 --> 47:49.560]  But when I see
[47:49.560 --> 47:51.560]  CNN, MSNBC, ABC News
[47:51.560 --> 47:53.560]  And
[47:53.560 --> 47:55.560]  And in CBS News
[47:55.560 --> 47:57.560]  Putting out a documentary
[47:57.560 --> 47:59.560]  About how 80%
[47:59.560 --> 48:01.560]  Or 70% depending on the month
[48:01.560 --> 48:03.560]  Of the money and weapons
[48:03.560 --> 48:05.560]  Get stolen and disappeared
[48:05.560 --> 48:07.560]  In Ukraine
[48:07.560 --> 48:09.560]  There it is
[48:09.560 --> 48:11.560]  CBS censors its own documentary
[48:11.560 --> 48:13.560]  Exposing how 70% of
[48:13.560 --> 48:15.560]  U.S. funding of Ukraine
[48:15.560 --> 48:17.560]  Is wasted
[48:17.560 --> 48:19.560]  I see the establishment
[48:19.560 --> 48:21.560]  Hedging its bed
[48:21.560 --> 48:23.560]  Getting ready to
[48:23.560 --> 48:25.560]  Abandon their puppet
[48:25.560 --> 48:27.560]  Actor, gay porn star
[48:27.560 --> 48:29.560]  Zelensky
[48:29.560 --> 48:31.560]  And I'm not against him that he's a gay porn star
[48:31.560 --> 48:33.560]  The point is they have been blackmailed
[48:33.560 --> 48:35.560]  Over that
[48:35.560 --> 48:37.560]  Just this week
[48:37.560 --> 48:39.560]  Biden announces another
[48:39.560 --> 48:41.560]  Billion
[48:41.560 --> 48:43.560]  Every few days it's 300 million, 800 million
[48:43.560 --> 48:45.560]  A billion, 2 billion, 5 billion
[48:45.560 --> 48:47.560]  Oh they want 64 billion
[48:47.560 --> 48:49.560]  But most of that's being
[48:49.560 --> 48:51.560]  Condered off and stole
[48:51.560 --> 48:53.560]  But it shows how schizophrenic
[48:53.560 --> 48:55.560]  The establishment is
[48:55.560 --> 48:57.560]  That even
[48:57.560 --> 48:59.560]  CBS News puts out a report admitting
[48:59.560 --> 49:01.560]  70% gets stolen
[49:01.560 --> 49:03.560]  And then
[49:03.560 --> 49:05.560]  CBS removes and censors its own
[49:05.560 --> 49:07.560]  Story because there's conflicting
[49:07.560 --> 49:09.560]  Power structures inside the system
[49:11.560 --> 49:13.560]  So the takeaway isn't that Roger Waters
[49:13.560 --> 49:15.560]  The amazing artist and the head
[49:15.560 --> 49:17.560]  Of Pink Floyd is very smart
[49:17.560 --> 49:19.560]  What he said is true
[49:19.560 --> 49:21.560]  I'll play a little bit of moment
[49:21.560 --> 49:23.560]  On CNN
[49:23.560 --> 49:25.560]  Where he destroyed the so called
[49:25.560 --> 49:27.560]  Journalist
[49:27.560 --> 49:29.560]  That's not the issue of what Roger
[49:29.560 --> 49:31.560]  Waters says, he's always saying that
[49:31.560 --> 49:33.560]  He's always right
[49:35.560 --> 49:37.560]  No
[49:37.560 --> 49:39.560]  It's that they're saying
[49:39.560 --> 49:41.560]  That's what the big
[49:41.560 --> 49:43.560]  Issue is
[49:43.560 --> 49:45.560]  Why are they suddenly
[49:45.560 --> 49:47.560]  Saying
[49:47.560 --> 49:49.560]  Zelensky stealing the money
[49:49.560 --> 49:51.560]  Why are they suddenly saying Russia's
[49:51.560 --> 49:53.560]  Winning the war
[49:53.560 --> 49:55.560]  Because they're getting their exit strategy
[49:55.560 --> 49:57.560]  Ready here, because Russia
[49:57.560 --> 49:59.560]  Is winning
[49:59.560 --> 50:01.560]  And winning big
[50:01.560 --> 50:03.560]  Has Russia gotten a lot of people killed?
[50:03.560 --> 50:05.560]  Yeah, between 20 and 23
[50:05.560 --> 50:07.560]  Million, depending on whose estimate you look at
[50:07.560 --> 50:09.560]  The Russians say 23 million
[50:09.560 --> 50:11.560]  Died, the West says 21 million
[50:11.560 --> 50:13.560]  20 million Germans
[50:13.560 --> 50:15.560]  In World War II
[50:15.560 --> 50:17.560]  Roger Waters' dad
[50:17.560 --> 50:19.560]  Died in World War II
[50:19.560 --> 50:21.560]  He wasn't belittling
[50:21.560 --> 50:23.560]  Groups that died
[50:23.560 --> 50:25.560]  From the US and England
[50:25.560 --> 50:27.560]  And Canada and Australia and New Zealand
[50:29.560 --> 50:31.560]  When he said
[50:31.560 --> 50:33.560]  Thank God Russia fought most of the war
[50:33.560 --> 50:35.560]  The US came into the western theater
[50:37.560 --> 50:39.560]  In the end of the night
[50:39.560 --> 50:43.560]  In the evening
[50:43.560 --> 50:45.560]  Roger Waters wasn't belittling
[50:45.560 --> 50:47.560]  His father, the dad in World War II
[50:47.560 --> 50:49.560]  As a soldier
[50:49.560 --> 50:51.560]  When he was two years old
[50:53.560 --> 50:55.560]  He was just stating the fact
[50:55.560 --> 50:57.560]  America lost 600,000 troops
[50:57.560 --> 50:59.560]  The Russians lost 23 million
[50:59.560 --> 51:01.560]  And the CNN reporter says
[51:01.560 --> 51:03.560]  Hasn't Russia learned its lesson
[51:03.560 --> 51:05.560]  As if Russia started World War II
[51:05.560 --> 51:07.560]  I mean the rewriting
[51:07.560 --> 51:09.560]  Of history is insane
[51:09.560 --> 51:11.560]  Estimates are
[51:11.560 --> 51:13.560]  From a lot of sources
[51:13.560 --> 51:15.560]  And I've checked them, they're accurate
[51:15.560 --> 51:17.560]  There's probably 100,000 dead Russians
[51:17.560 --> 51:19.560]  Using
[51:19.560 --> 51:21.560]  Third generation warfare
[51:21.560 --> 51:23.560]  Against fifth generation warfare
[51:23.560 --> 51:25.560]  But just with hardcore manpower
[51:25.560 --> 51:27.560]  And blood
[51:27.560 --> 51:29.560]  They're winning
[51:29.560 --> 51:31.560]  They're up against robots, switchblade drones
[51:33.560 --> 51:35.560]  The Ukrainians using human shields
[51:35.560 --> 51:37.560]  Which Amos International now confirms
[51:37.560 --> 51:39.560]  That we told you six months ago
[51:45.560 --> 51:47.560]  So you think the Russians are going to give up
[51:47.560 --> 51:49.560]  With 100,000 dead? No
[51:49.560 --> 51:51.560]  I don't see 100,000 dead Russians
[51:51.560 --> 51:53.560]  In 18 dead generals
[51:53.560 --> 51:55.560]  As a sign of weakness
[51:55.560 --> 51:57.560]  I see it as a sign of commitment
[51:59.560 --> 52:01.560]  And I'm not rooting for the Russians
[52:01.560 --> 52:03.560]  I wish this war wouldn't have happened
[52:03.560 --> 52:05.560]  But you've got third generation warfare
[52:05.560 --> 52:07.560]  Up against fifth generation warfare
[52:07.560 --> 52:09.560]  And it's winning, showing the power
[52:09.560 --> 52:11.560]  Of humans and the will
[52:11.560 --> 52:13.560]  To battle those robots
[52:13.560 --> 52:15.560]  Because that's what they're fighting
[52:17.560 --> 52:19.560]  There's 8 billion of us folks
[52:19.560 --> 52:21.560]  We want to smash the robots
[52:21.560 --> 52:23.560]  We can do it quite quickly
[52:23.560 --> 52:25.560]  That's an example Russia just made again
[52:25.560 --> 52:27.560]  We're going to cover all of this
[52:27.560 --> 52:29.560]  In a moment, but here's Roger Waters
[52:29.560 --> 52:31.560]  Who completely knocks out the part
[52:31.560 --> 52:33.560]  Well, he's fueling the fire
[52:33.560 --> 52:35.560]  In the Ukraine for a start
[52:35.560 --> 52:37.560]  That is a huge crime
[52:37.560 --> 52:39.560]  Why won't the United States
[52:39.560 --> 52:41.560]  Of America encourage
[52:41.560 --> 52:43.560]  Zelensky, the president
[52:43.560 --> 52:45.560]  To negotiate obviating
[52:45.560 --> 52:47.560]  The need for this horrific
[52:47.560 --> 52:49.560]  Horrendous war
[52:49.560 --> 52:51.560]  That's killing
[52:51.560 --> 52:53.560]  We don't know how many Ukraine
[52:53.560 --> 52:55.560]  The party that got invaded
[52:55.560 --> 52:57.560]  Come on, you've got it reversed
[52:57.560 --> 52:59.560]  Well, that's it
[52:59.560 --> 53:01.560]  Any war, when did it start
[53:01.560 --> 53:03.560]  What you need to do is look
[53:03.560 --> 53:05.560]  At the history and you can say
[53:05.560 --> 53:07.560]  Well, it started on this day
[53:07.560 --> 53:09.560]  You can say it started in 2008
[53:11.560 --> 53:13.560]  This war is basically
[53:13.560 --> 53:15.560]  About the action
[53:15.560 --> 53:17.560]  And reaction of NATO
[53:17.560 --> 53:19.560]  Pushing right up to the Russian border
[53:19.560 --> 53:21.560]  Which they promised they wouldn't do
[53:21.560 --> 53:23.560]  When Gorbachev negotiated
[53:23.560 --> 53:25.560]  The withdrawal of the USSR
[53:25.560 --> 53:27.560]  From the whole of Eastern Europe
[53:27.560 --> 53:29.560]  When you say this, then I have to say
[53:29.560 --> 53:31.560]  What about our role as liberators
[53:31.560 --> 53:33.560]  You, of all people
[53:33.560 --> 53:35.560]  You have no role as liberators
[53:35.560 --> 53:37.560]  World War II
[53:37.560 --> 53:39.560]  You've gone into World War II because
[53:39.560 --> 53:41.560]  It's Pearl Harbor
[53:41.560 --> 53:43.560]  You were completely isolationist
[53:43.560 --> 53:45.560]  Until that's sad
[53:45.560 --> 53:47.560]  That devastating
[53:47.560 --> 53:49.560]  I would argue we were always going
[53:49.560 --> 53:51.560]  To get in and push us in
[53:51.560 --> 53:53.560]  But thank God the United States got in
[53:53.560 --> 53:55.560]  Right? You lost your father in World War II
[53:55.560 --> 53:57.560]  Thank God the United States
[53:57.560 --> 53:59.560]  But thank God the Russians had already
[53:59.560 --> 54:01.560]  Won the bloody war almost by then
[54:01.560 --> 54:03.560]  And don't forget 23 million Russians
[54:03.560 --> 54:05.560]  Died
[54:05.560 --> 54:07.560]  Protecting you and me
[54:07.560 --> 54:09.560]  From the Nazi menace
[54:09.560 --> 54:11.560]  And you would think the Russians
[54:11.560 --> 54:13.560]  Would have learned their lesson from war
[54:13.560 --> 54:15.560]  And wouldn't have invaded Ukraine
[54:15.560 --> 54:17.560]  Well, you, with all your reading
[54:17.560 --> 54:19.560]  I would suggest you, Eichel
[54:19.560 --> 54:21.560]  That you go away
[54:21.560 --> 54:23.560]  And read a bit more
[54:23.560 --> 54:25.560]  And then try and figure out
[54:25.560 --> 54:27.560]  What the United States would do
[54:27.560 --> 54:29.560]  If the Chinese were putting
[54:29.560 --> 54:31.560]  Nuclear-armed missiles
[54:31.560 --> 54:33.560]  Into Mexico and Canada
[54:33.560 --> 54:35.560]  The Chinese are too busy encircling Taiwan
[54:35.560 --> 54:37.560]  As we speak
[54:37.560 --> 54:39.560]  They're not encircling Taiwan
[54:39.560 --> 54:41.560]  Taiwan is part of China
[54:41.560 --> 54:43.560]  And that's been absolutely accepted
[54:43.560 --> 54:45.560]  By the whole of the international community
[54:45.560 --> 54:47.560]  Since 1948
[54:47.560 --> 54:49.560]  And if you don't know that
[54:49.560 --> 54:51.560]  You're not reading enough
[54:51.560 --> 54:53.560]  Go and read about it
[54:53.560 --> 54:55.560]  And as much as I don't want the
[54:55.560 --> 54:57.560]  Communist Chinese to take over Taiwan
[54:57.560 --> 54:59.560]  And it's always been part of China
[54:59.560 --> 55:01.560]  So, that was the truth
[55:03.560 --> 55:05.560]  And the issue is
[55:05.560 --> 55:07.560]  Why is this being allowed out?
[55:07.560 --> 55:09.560]  China extends Taiwan drills
[55:09.560 --> 55:11.560]  Past Sunday
[55:11.560 --> 55:13.560]  Deadline says training under real war conditions
[55:13.560 --> 55:15.560]  Amnesty
[55:15.560 --> 55:17.560]  Sorry, not sorry for revealing Ukraine
[55:17.560 --> 55:19.560]  International law using human shields
[55:19.560 --> 55:21.560]  CBS News
[55:21.560 --> 55:23.560]  Exposing how 70%
[55:23.560 --> 55:25.560]  Of U.S. funding of Ukraine
[55:25.560 --> 55:27.560]  Is wasted
[55:27.560 --> 55:29.560]  And it just goes on
[55:29.560 --> 55:31.560]  From there
[55:31.560 --> 55:33.560]  U.N. slams suicidal nuclear plant attacks
[55:37.560 --> 55:39.560]  Russia is winning
[55:39.560 --> 55:41.560]  The war in Ukraine
[55:41.560 --> 55:43.560]  And it's going to take about a third of the country
[55:43.560 --> 55:45.560]  That's always been part of Russia
[55:45.560 --> 55:47.560]  And the fact that they're now starting
[55:47.560 --> 55:49.560]  To turn old Zelensky in the news
[55:49.560 --> 55:51.560]  Shows you that they're moving on
[55:51.560 --> 55:53.560]  To the next thing
[55:53.560 --> 55:55.560]  What's the next thing?
[55:55.560 --> 55:57.560]  A cyber attack that cuts off the power grid?
[55:57.560 --> 55:59.560]  A huge giant false flag?
[56:01.560 --> 56:03.560]  I don't know, but with 92 days
[56:03.560 --> 56:05.560]  After the election
[56:05.560 --> 56:07.560]  You know the globalists are going to pull something big
[56:07.560 --> 56:09.560]  So I'll ask the callers who are on hold
[56:09.560 --> 56:11.560]  I'll go to you next hour
[56:11.560 --> 56:13.560]  You can talk about whatever you want
[56:13.560 --> 56:15.560]  Tell me
[56:15.560 --> 56:17.560]  Tell me what you think they might pull
[56:17.560 --> 56:19.560]  Or maybe you don't think they'll pull something
[56:19.560 --> 56:21.560]  We'll talk to you about that
[56:21.560 --> 56:23.560]  But listeners
[56:23.560 --> 56:25.560]  Now in this climate
[56:25.560 --> 56:27.560]  With what's happening in the world
[56:27.560 --> 56:29.560]  It's more important than ever to keep him
[56:29.560 --> 56:31.560]  Of course on the air
[56:31.560 --> 56:33.560]  I cannot describe to you how amazing you are
[56:33.560 --> 56:35.560]  Supporting us while getting great products
[56:35.560 --> 56:37.560]  At the same time over the years
[56:37.560 --> 56:39.560]  Don't wait
[56:39.560 --> 56:41.560]  Everything we've done has been building towards this point
[56:41.560 --> 56:43.560]  In the last few months
[56:43.560 --> 56:45.560]  Now
[56:45.560 --> 56:47.560]  If we don't get solving
[56:47.560 --> 56:49.560]  And get enough money
[56:49.560 --> 56:51.560]  To come out of this bankrupt seat
[56:51.560 --> 56:53.560]  They'll appoint a receiver
[56:53.560 --> 56:55.560]  And start selling off the equipment
[56:55.560 --> 56:57.560]  But I believe in you
[56:57.560 --> 56:59.560]  So if you go to infowarstore.com
[56:59.560 --> 57:01.560]  And get a book, a film, a t-shirt
[57:01.560 --> 57:03.560]  Vitamineral fusions back in stock
[57:03.560 --> 57:05.560]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula
[57:05.560 --> 57:07.560]  We're about to sell out of
[57:07.560 --> 57:09.560]  Diet force
[57:09.560 --> 57:11.560]  From super blue the original
[57:11.560 --> 57:13.560]  Everybody wanted it back
[57:13.560 --> 57:15.560]  It's back super blue the original
[57:15.560 --> 57:17.560]  We're going to sell out of this
[57:17.560 --> 57:19.560]  In like five, six days at current sales rates
[57:19.560 --> 57:21.560]  Because it's 50% off
[57:21.560 --> 57:23.560]  When you get it with the other two toothpaste
[57:23.560 --> 57:25.560]  We have 40% off by itself

[57:31.560 --> 57:33.560]  You can wait later and wish you'd take an action
[57:33.560 --> 57:35.560]  But if you want to keep it info wars on the air
[57:35.560 --> 57:37.560]  Now is the time
[57:37.560 --> 57:39.560]  Our triple eight two five three
[57:39.560 --> 57:41.560]  Three one three nine
[57:41.560 --> 57:43.560]  Your phone calls are straight ahead
[57:43.560 --> 57:45.560]  First an important message about the future of info wars
[57:49.560 --> 57:51.560]  The great reset in the war for the world
[57:51.560 --> 57:53.560]  Is the book that the government
[57:53.560 --> 57:55.560]  Doesn't want you to read
[57:55.560 --> 57:57.560]  That most of the big powerful companies
[57:57.560 --> 57:59.560]  Trying to control your life
[57:59.560 --> 58:01.560]  The big tech companies
[58:01.560 --> 58:03.560]  They don't want you to read this book
[58:03.560 --> 58:05.560]  They want to control what you think
[58:05.560 --> 58:07.560]  What you read but you don't want that
[58:07.560 --> 58:09.560]  And Alex Jones doesn't want that
[58:09.560 --> 58:11.560]  And this book shows you what's happening
[58:11.560 --> 58:13.560]  And gives you the sort of playbook
[58:13.560 --> 58:15.560]  For how to fight against it
[58:15.560 --> 58:17.560]  And so by buying this book
[58:17.560 --> 58:19.560]  You're going to prove that censorship doesn't work
[58:19.560 --> 58:21.560]  That freedom is alive in this country
[58:21.560 --> 58:23.560]  This is essential reading
[58:23.560 --> 58:25.560]  And you know I would go right now
[58:25.560 --> 58:27.560]  And buy it before the censorship kicks in
[58:27.560 --> 58:29.560]  It's not going to be available
[58:29.560 --> 58:31.560]  In bookstores
[58:31.560 --> 58:33.560]  It's not going to be available in libraries
[58:33.560 --> 58:35.560]  They'll try to take it down
[58:35.560 --> 58:37.560]  From every platform that they can
[58:37.560 --> 58:39.560]  But they're not going to be able to do it
[58:39.560 --> 58:41.560]  Prove that censorship doesn't work
[58:41.560 --> 58:43.560]  Buy the great reset
[58:43.560 --> 58:45.560]  Thank you Alex Jones
[58:45.560 --> 58:47.560]  I really appreciate you having me on
[58:47.560 --> 58:49.560]  And I appreciate you writing this book
[58:49.560 --> 59:03.560]  We are now living in the void
[59:03.560 --> 59:05.560]  Stay calm because now is the time
[59:05.560 --> 59:07.560]  That we must get our bearings
[59:07.560 --> 59:10.560]  And steer the ship onto a safe sound course
[59:10.560 --> 59:13.560]  There is nothing stopping we the people
[59:13.560 --> 59:15.560]  From making our own rules
[59:15.560 --> 59:17.560]  And building our own society
[59:17.560 --> 59:19.560]  All we got to do is survive the crash
[59:19.560 --> 59:21.560]  And right now we still have time
[59:21.560 --> 59:23.560]  To prepare
[59:23.560 --> 59:25.560]  The world fiat currency system
[59:25.560 --> 59:27.560]  Is racing towards zero
[59:27.560 --> 59:29.560]  It's time to convert it into hard assets

[59:49.560 --> 59:51.560]  Leading a frontal assault
[59:51.560 --> 59:53.560]  On the lies of the New World Order
[59:53.560 --> 59:55.560]  It's Alex Jones
[1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:07.560]  And it's time for humanity to stand up
[1:00:07.560 --> 1:00:09.560]  In the end for war
[1:00:09.560 --> 1:00:11.560]  And say I don't know what's going to happen
[1:00:11.560 --> 1:00:13.560]  To me into this
[1:00:13.560 --> 1:00:15.560]  I don't believe you got one!
[1:00:17.560 --> 1:00:19.560]  From the front lines
[1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:21.560]  Of the information war
[1:00:21.560 --> 1:00:45.560]  Alex Jones
[1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:49.560]  For less than 20 minutes
[1:00:49.560 --> 1:00:51.560]  He questioned the official narrative
[1:00:51.560 --> 1:00:53.560]  Of the Sandy Hook school shooting
[1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:55.560]  Because for the so called truth or community
[1:00:55.560 --> 1:00:57.560]  That was the big story
[1:00:57.560 --> 1:00:59.560]  And so he did his job and covered the story
[1:00:59.560 --> 1:01:01.560]  Just like he's done for the other
[1:01:01.560 --> 1:01:03.560]  1.8 million minutes
[1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:05.560]  Of his career
[1:01:05.560 --> 1:01:07.560]  Alex Jones has been questioning the official narrative
[1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:09.560]  Of the corrupt mainstream media
[1:01:09.560 --> 1:01:11.560]  And exposing the authoritarian cabal
[1:01:11.560 --> 1:01:13.560]  Hiding in the shadows
[1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:15.560]  For 28 years
[1:01:15.560 --> 1:01:17.560]  And over time this revival
[1:01:17.560 --> 1:01:19.560]  Of the truth has grown into millions
[1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:21.560]  Worldwide
[1:01:21.560 --> 1:01:23.560]  Alex Jones expanded his broadcast
[1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:25.560]  By selling a line of products
[1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:27.560]  Focused on healing
[1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:29.560]  From the toxic world of a corrupt system
[1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:31.560]  Which has allowed info wars
[1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:33.560]  To remain a free public broadcast
[1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:35.560]  To combat the dangerous lies
[1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:37.560]  Of the mainstream media
[1:01:37.560 --> 1:01:39.560]  In 2018
[1:01:39.560 --> 1:01:41.560]  With zero evidence
[1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:43.560]  Of their wild claims
[1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:45.560]  A George Soros funded lawsuit
[1:01:45.560 --> 1:01:47.560]  Filed against Alex Jones
[1:01:47.560 --> 1:01:49.560]  And info wars
[1:01:49.560 --> 1:01:51.560]  Four months later, big tech
[1:01:51.560 --> 1:01:53.560]  Removes info wars from the internet
[1:01:53.560 --> 1:01:55.560]  We were meant to be destroyed
[1:01:55.560 --> 1:01:57.560]  Four years ago
[1:01:57.560 --> 1:01:59.560]  But thanks to an awakened audience
[1:01:59.560 --> 1:02:01.560]  That cares about the truth
[1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:03.560]  The info wars signal has only grown stronger
[1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:05.560]  And now they are no longer hiding the fact
[1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:07.560]  That they are standing on the graves
[1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:09.560]  Of dead children
[1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:11.560]  And using their grieving parents
[1:02:11.560 --> 1:02:13.560]  As a political weapon to silence
[1:02:13.560 --> 1:02:15.560]  Of alternative news media
[1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:17.560]  I ask that with your verdict
[1:02:17.560 --> 1:02:19.560]  You not only
[1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:21.560]  Take Alex Jones' platform
[1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:23.560]  That he talks about
[1:02:23.560 --> 1:02:25.560]  Away
[1:02:25.560 --> 1:02:27.560]  I ask that you make certain
[1:02:27.560 --> 1:02:29.560]  He can't rebuild the platform
[1:02:29.560 --> 1:02:31.560]  That's what matters
[1:02:31.560 --> 1:02:33.560]  Take him
[1:02:33.560 --> 1:02:35.560]  Out of this discourse
[1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:37.560]  Of this misinformation
[1:02:37.560 --> 1:02:39.560]  Of this peddling of lies
[1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:41.560]  And make sure he can't
[1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:43.560]  Do it again
[1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:45.560]  Alex Jones
[1:02:45.560 --> 1:02:47.560]  Is patient
[1:02:47.560 --> 1:02:49.560]  Zero
[1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:51.560]  For our society's inability
[1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:53.560]  To speak without lies
[1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:55.560]  He is patient
[1:02:55.560 --> 1:02:57.560]  Zero for alternative
[1:02:57.560 --> 1:02:59.560]  Facts
[1:02:59.560 --> 1:03:01.560]  And according to Judge Gamble
[1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:03.560]  Acting like O'Brien
[1:03:03.560 --> 1:03:05.560]  Straight out of George Orwell's 1984
[1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:07.560]  The judge decides
[1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:09.560]  What is true
[1:03:09.560 --> 1:03:11.560]  To say to this jury
[1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:13.560]  That you comply with the stubborn
[1:03:13.560 --> 1:03:15.560]  That is not true
[1:03:15.560 --> 1:03:17.560]  You may not say it again
[1:03:17.560 --> 1:03:19.560]  You may not tell this jury
[1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:21.560]  That you are bankrupt
[1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:23.560]  That is also not true
[1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:25.560]  You are already under oath
[1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:27.560]  To tell the truth
[1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:29.560]  You've already
[1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:31.560]  Violated that oath
[1:03:31.560 --> 1:03:33.560]  Twice today
[1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:35.560]  In just those two examples
[1:03:35.560 --> 1:03:37.560]  It seems
[1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:39.560]  Absurd
[1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:41.560]  To instruct you again
[1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:43.560]  That you must tell the truth
[1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:45.560]  While you testify
[1:03:45.560 --> 1:03:47.560]  Yet here I am
[1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:49.560]  You must tell the truth
[1:03:49.560 --> 1:03:51.560]  While you testify
[1:03:51.560 --> 1:03:53.560]  This is not your show
[1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:55.560]  Do you understand what I have said?
[1:03:55.560 --> 1:03:57.560]  Yes, I believe what I said was true
[1:03:57.560 --> 1:03:59.560]  Yes, you believe everything
[1:03:59.560 --> 1:04:01.560]  You say is true but it isn't
[1:04:01.560 --> 1:04:03.560]  Your beliefs do not make something true
[1:04:03.560 --> 1:04:05.560]  That is
[1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:07.560]  What we're doing here
[1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:09.560]  Just because you claim to think
[1:04:09.560 --> 1:04:11.560]  Something is true does not make it true
[1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:13.560]  There's going to be a large set
[1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:15.560]  Of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing
[1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:17.560]  Up the corpse of InfoWars in the bankruptcy
[1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:19.560]  estate
[1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:21.560]  The decision to terminate the InfoWars
[1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:23.560]  Broadcast is not
[1:04:23.560 --> 1:04:25.560]  In the hands of this crooked cabal
[1:04:25.560 --> 1:04:27.560]  It is and always has been
[1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:29.560]  The will of our audience
[1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:31.560]  That decide our fate
[1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:33.560]  The InfoWars audience
[1:04:33.560 --> 1:04:35.560]  Has mobilized and awakened
[1:04:35.560 --> 1:04:37.560]  The world to the threat that is
[1:04:37.560 --> 1:04:39.560]  Globalism and with your continued
[1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:41.560]  Support we will keep going
[1:04:41.560 --> 1:04:43.560]  Join us now and support
[1:04:43.560 --> 1:04:45.560]  The InfoWars
[1:04:47.560 --> 1:04:49.560]  Your phone calls are coming up
[1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:51.560]  In 60 seconds
[1:04:51.560 --> 1:04:53.560]  Get ready folks, a lot of critical
[1:04:53.560 --> 1:04:55.560]  This will be covered as well
[1:04:59.560 --> 1:05:01.560]  The great reset in the war for the
[1:05:01.560 --> 1:05:03.560]  World is the book that the government
[1:05:03.560 --> 1:05:05.560]  Doesn't want you to read that
[1:05:05.560 --> 1:05:07.560]  Most of the big powerful companies
[1:05:07.560 --> 1:05:09.560]  Trying to control your life, the big
[1:05:09.560 --> 1:05:11.560]  Tech companies, they don't want you
[1:05:11.560 --> 1:05:13.560]  To read this book, they want to control
[1:05:13.560 --> 1:05:15.560]  What you think, what you do, what you
[1:05:15.560 --> 1:05:17.560]  Read, but you don't want that
[1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:19.560]  And Alex Jones doesn't want that
[1:05:19.560 --> 1:05:21.560]  And this book shows you what's happening
[1:05:21.560 --> 1:05:23.560]  And gives you the sort of playbook
[1:05:23.560 --> 1:05:25.560]  For how to fight against it
[1:05:25.560 --> 1:05:27.560]  And so by buying this book you're going to
[1:05:27.560 --> 1:05:29.560]  Prove that censorship doesn't work
[1:05:29.560 --> 1:05:31.560]  That freedom is alive in this country
[1:05:31.560 --> 1:05:33.560]  This is essential reading
[1:05:33.560 --> 1:05:35.560]  And I would go right now
[1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:37.560]  And buy it before the censorship
[1:05:37.560 --> 1:05:39.560]  Kicks in, it's not going to be available
[1:05:39.560 --> 1:05:41.560]  In bookstores, it's not going to be
[1:05:41.560 --> 1:05:43.560]  Available in libraries, they're going to
[1:05:43.560 --> 1:05:45.560]  Try to take it down from every platform
[1:05:45.560 --> 1:05:47.560]  That they can, but they're not going to
[1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:49.560]  Be able to do it, prove that censorship
[1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:51.560]  Doesn't work, buy the great reset
[1:05:51.560 --> 1:05:53.560]  Thank you Alex Jones, I really appreciate
[1:05:53.560 --> 1:05:55.560]  You having me on and I appreciate
[1:05:55.560 --> 1:05:57.560]  You writing this book and getting the
[1:05:57.560 --> 1:05:59.560]  Out there
[1:06:39.560 --> 1:06:41.560]  They fear the resistance, they fear
[1:06:41.560 --> 1:06:43.560]  The populace, they fear you
[1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:45.560]  And they fear those of us
[1:06:45.560 --> 1:06:47.560]  That are focal points
[1:06:47.560 --> 1:06:49.560]  In this fight against this modern
[1:06:49.560 --> 1:06:51.560]  Technotronic tyranny
[1:06:51.560 --> 1:06:53.560]  Alright, I'm going to take a lot of calls
[1:06:53.560 --> 1:06:55.560]  This hour into the next hour
[1:06:55.560 --> 1:06:57.560]  And I got a bunch of news to hit
[1:06:57.560 --> 1:06:59.560]  As well, we haven't broke yet
[1:06:59.560 --> 1:07:01.560]  I don't love the callers, but just each person
[1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:03.560]  Get 60 seconds, don't need to thank me
[1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:05.560]  Don't need to say anything, I say your name
[1:07:05.560 --> 1:07:07.560]  You're on air, you hit us
[1:07:07.560 --> 1:07:09.560]  And you tell us what you want to cover
[1:07:09.560 --> 1:07:11.560]  I'm going to go, in the order the calls are
[1:07:11.560 --> 1:07:13.560]  Received, Nick in Oklahoma, thanks for calling
[1:07:13.560 --> 1:07:15.560]  Yes sir, first office
[1:07:15.560 --> 1:07:17.560]  And I want to speak to you
[1:07:17.560 --> 1:07:19.560]  We'll make this quick
[1:07:19.560 --> 1:07:21.560]  You know, as far as the Russian
[1:07:21.560 --> 1:07:23.560]  As far as Russia's concerned
[1:07:23.560 --> 1:07:25.560]  China experimenting
[1:07:25.560 --> 1:07:27.560]  With war games
[1:07:27.560 --> 1:07:29.560]  Going on outside of Taiwan
[1:07:29.560 --> 1:07:31.560]  I think when Russia gets done
[1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:33.560]  They're going to sit
[1:07:33.560 --> 1:07:35.560]  China and Russia are going to sit back
[1:07:35.560 --> 1:07:37.560]  And wait to see what we here in the US do
[1:07:37.560 --> 1:07:39.560]  As far as our leadership's concerned
[1:07:39.560 --> 1:07:41.560]  And if we don't handle our own problems
[1:07:41.560 --> 1:07:43.560]  I got a feeling they're going to come over here
[1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:45.560]  And handle it for us
[1:07:45.560 --> 1:07:47.560]  That's just me, the way that I see the information
[1:07:47.560 --> 1:07:49.560]  Coming out
[1:07:49.560 --> 1:07:51.560]  Sir, it's very interesting you said that
[1:07:51.560 --> 1:07:53.560]  The first thing I was going to cover
[1:07:53.560 --> 1:07:55.560]  Is a trend I see in the Washington Post
[1:07:55.560 --> 1:07:57.560]  And the Atlantic
[1:07:57.560 --> 1:07:59.560]  And other establishment mouthpieces
[1:07:59.560 --> 1:08:01.560]  Where they brag America's over
[1:08:01.560 --> 1:08:03.560]  What's America's great unwinding
[1:08:03.560 --> 1:08:05.560]  Would mean for the world, the Atlantic
[1:08:05.560 --> 1:08:07.560]  Here's another one
[1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:09.560]  Parage warns of America falls to Marxist
[1:08:09.560 --> 1:08:11.560]  Western civilization will follow
[1:08:11.560 --> 1:08:13.560]  I think that's what you're talking about
[1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:15.560]  If they think America's weak, they're going to make their move
[1:08:15.560 --> 1:08:17.560]  Yeah man, that's exactly what I think
[1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:19.560]  Is a potential for all this
[1:08:19.560 --> 1:08:21.560]  To happen and come about
[1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:23.560]  Again though, I think it's all dependent
[1:08:23.560 --> 1:08:25.560]  On how we the citizens
[1:08:25.560 --> 1:08:27.560]  Handle our own leadership
[1:08:27.560 --> 1:08:29.560]  If we don't take care of this mess
[1:08:29.560 --> 1:08:31.560]  That we got ourselves in
[1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:33.560]  Somebody else is going to come in here
[1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:35.560]  And take care of it for us
[1:08:35.560 --> 1:08:37.560]  Incredible information, you're dead on
[1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:39.560]  The fight for the world is
[1:08:39.560 --> 1:08:41.560]  America
[1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:43.560]  Absolutely sir
[1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:45.560]  And again, thank you so much
[1:08:45.560 --> 1:08:47.560]  And just let you know I did go by your book
[1:08:47.560 --> 1:08:49.560]  And I look forward to many more
[1:08:49.560 --> 1:08:51.560]  Broadcasts from you guys
[1:08:51.560 --> 1:08:53.560]  Thank you sir, I don't want to quit fighting
[1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:55.560]  And I can't do it without you
[1:08:55.560 --> 1:08:57.560]  So I'm literally begging you to keep me in the fight
[1:08:57.560 --> 1:08:59.560]  Brother, God bless you, thank you
[1:08:59.560 --> 1:09:01.560]  I don't fear death, but I fear losing
[1:09:01.560 --> 1:09:03.560]  Man, I hate these people
[1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:05.560]  I know they hate us, I just want to beat them
[1:09:05.560 --> 1:09:07.560]  Because they're hurting our children
[1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:09.560]  Sal and Philly, you're on the air
[1:09:09.560 --> 1:09:11.560]  Thanks for holding
[1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:13.560]  Alex calling you from behind enemy lines
[1:09:13.560 --> 1:09:15.560]  In Philadelphia, you got your book
[1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:17.560]  On the way to my house
[1:09:17.560 --> 1:09:19.560]  Just took a big drop or a brain force
[1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:21.560]  Love you man
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:23.560]  Love you brother, what's your view on this
[1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:25.560]  What's your view on the situation
[1:09:25.560 --> 1:09:27.560]  I feel like they already
[1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:29.560]  China already took over
[1:09:29.560 --> 1:09:31.560]  And we're sort of going through
[1:09:31.560 --> 1:09:33.560]  The takeover right now
[1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:35.560]  At the crossroads, but it feels like
[1:09:35.560 --> 1:09:37.560]  They're already here to me
[1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:39.560]  Yeah, they stole the election, they broke the borders
[1:09:39.560 --> 1:09:41.560]  They're destroying the dollar
[1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:43.560]  So it feels like nothing's happening
[1:09:43.560 --> 1:09:45.560]  We're talking about stuff and nothing's happening
[1:09:45.560 --> 1:09:47.560]  We're just patiently waiting
[1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:49.560]  That's right, we're under economic warfare
[1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:51.560]  This new bill is designed to destroy
[1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:53.560]  Spall business, 86,000
[1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:55.560]  New IRS ages, it's incredible
[1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:57.560]  I can't wait to read your book
[1:09:57.560 --> 1:09:59.560]  Alex, I hope you kicked their butts
[1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:01.560]  In the legal battles
[1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:03.560]  And you keep fighting
[1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:05.560]  Well, let me tell you, it's like George Washington
[1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:07.560]  I'm not going to compare myself with George Washington
[1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:09.560]  But I want to follow George Washington's example
[1:10:09.560 --> 1:10:11.560]  He lost 90%
[1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:13.560]  Of the battles through the last year
[1:10:13.560 --> 1:10:15.560]  But the perseverance wore out the enemy
[1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:17.560]  You understand that? It's perseverance, brother
[1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:19.560]  Alex, you are
[1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:21.560]  You're going to win the most important battle
[1:10:21.560 --> 1:10:23.560]  Of the century
[1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:25.560]  Not without you, brother
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:27.560]  You got me, Alex
[1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:29.560]  We got your back
[1:10:29.560 --> 1:10:31.560]  Do host, my friend
[1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:33.560]  I'm loving that
[1:10:33.560 --> 1:10:35.560]  Do host, which means you got me
[1:10:35.560 --> 1:10:37.560]  Thank you so much, Sal
[1:10:37.560 --> 1:10:39.560]  You got me too, Sal
[1:10:39.560 --> 1:10:41.560]  Let's talk to another caller here
[1:10:41.560 --> 1:10:43.560]  Ryan in Illinois, you're on the air, Ryan
[1:10:43.560 --> 1:10:45.560]  How are you doing, Alex?
[1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:47.560]  Man, I am
[1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:49.560]  Watching the new older takeover, brother
[1:10:49.560 --> 1:10:51.560]  It's crazy
[1:10:51.560 --> 1:10:53.560]  First, I just wanted to say thank you
[1:10:53.560 --> 1:10:55.560]  For the X-2 and the I-9, it really changed my life
[1:10:55.560 --> 1:10:57.560]  I bought it to move heavy metals
[1:10:57.560 --> 1:10:59.560]  For my brain and everything
[1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:01.560]  And it gave me a second shot of life here with my stomach
[1:11:01.560 --> 1:11:03.560]  We cannot overhype what real deep earth crystal I-9 does
[1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:05.560]  It's purely atomic
[1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:07.560]  They hit us with all the bad halogens
[1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:09.560]  What happened when you took X-2?
[1:11:09.560 --> 1:11:11.560]  Spend some time on this, because this is one of the places
[1:11:11.560 --> 1:11:13.560]  We can really take control of our lives
[1:11:13.560 --> 1:11:15.560]  Yeah, just, you know
[1:11:15.560 --> 1:11:17.560]  The clarity of thought and
[1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:19.560]  All that comes along with it
[1:11:19.560 --> 1:11:21.560]  I haven't had it for a little bit right now, so I might stumble on a word
[1:11:21.560 --> 1:11:23.560]  But when I was on it, I definitely didn't stumble on words or anything
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:25.560]  But I had a stomach condition
[1:11:25.560 --> 1:11:27.560]  Like probably leaky bow syndrome or like bleeding ulcers
[1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:29.560]  Something horrible that I dealt with for a long time
[1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:31.560]  And after taking the iodine
[1:11:31.560 --> 1:11:33.560]  You know, my stomach quit hurting
[1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:35.560]  I look it up and I find articles online
[1:11:35.560 --> 1:11:37.560]  And stuff about being the number one cure
[1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:39.560]  For chronic stomach conditions
[1:11:39.560 --> 1:11:41.560]  And, you know, the iodine, or the iodine
[1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:43.560]  The doctor's that puzzle when you ask him about it
[1:11:43.560 --> 1:11:45.560]  Iodine is the number one deficiency
[1:11:45.560 --> 1:11:47.560]  And the other iodine products
[1:11:47.560 --> 1:11:49.560]  I don't know why other people didn't go get it from deep earth drilling like we do
[1:11:49.560 --> 1:11:51.560]  If it's bound to something else
[1:11:51.560 --> 1:11:53.560]  You don't absorb it, most people don't
[1:11:53.560 --> 1:11:55.560]  But if it's pure atomic, you do absorb it
[1:11:55.560 --> 1:11:57.560]  That's why it's so special
[1:11:57.560 --> 1:11:59.560]  Yeah, Sarah's my favorite
[1:11:59.560 --> 1:12:01.560]  I get a boost of energy like right when I take it
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:03.560]  I feel like just the energy
[1:12:03.560 --> 1:12:05.560]  Pulls hit my body, like as soon as I take it in the morning
[1:12:05.560 --> 1:12:07.560]  I'm not tired anymore, not groggy, just goes away
[1:12:07.560 --> 1:12:09.560]  Ryan, let's talk about the petrodollar
[1:12:09.560 --> 1:12:11.560]  And attack on gas
[1:12:11.560 --> 1:12:13.560]  Yes, sir, yeah, now that's what I've been told
[1:12:13.560 --> 1:12:15.560]  I'm like good at bringing things down to the easiest
[1:12:15.560 --> 1:12:17.560]  Common denominator
[1:12:17.560 --> 1:12:19.560]  And, you know, we have a petrodollar system
[1:12:19.560 --> 1:12:21.560]  And people are, you know, we've got all these idiots
[1:12:21.560 --> 1:12:23.560]  Running around here saying it's time to end fossil fuels
[1:12:23.560 --> 1:12:25.560]  I just can't understand how this isn't like
[1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:27.560]  Attempt to defraud the United States
[1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:29.560]  They're obviously getting rid of American hegemony
[1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:31.560]  Yeah, this is just ridiculous
[1:12:31.560 --> 1:12:33.560]  It doesn't make any sense, you know
[1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:35.560]  I've just, you know, been trying to find the truth for a while
[1:12:35.560 --> 1:12:37.560]  Then you find the truth and it's crazier than fiction, right?
[1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:39.560]  It is, Ryan, God bless you
[1:12:39.560 --> 1:12:41.560]  Marcos in Texas, you're on the air
[1:12:43.560 --> 1:12:47.560]  Do, do, ask, do, ask this
[1:12:47.560 --> 1:12:49.560]  You got me
[1:12:49.560 --> 1:12:51.560]  I'm so mad
[1:12:51.560 --> 1:12:53.560]  I want to say right now that
[1:12:53.560 --> 1:12:55.560]  Just like the last caller said
[1:12:55.560 --> 1:12:57.560]  They're, they're, they're here
[1:12:57.560 --> 1:12:59.560]  They're not coming, they're here
[1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:01.560]  And
[1:13:01.560 --> 1:13:03.560]  China and Taiwan
[1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:05.560]  I believe like y'all's video put out
[1:13:05.560 --> 1:13:07.560]  Is, is a distraction
[1:13:07.560 --> 1:13:09.560]  From the fact that they're actually building up
[1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:11.560]  For a land invasion of the United States
[1:13:11.560 --> 1:13:13.560]  Now, you can debate that all day
[1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:15.560]  But y'all's, y'all's video
[1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:17.560]  China is buying farms
[1:13:17.560 --> 1:13:19.560]  All across the U.S.
[1:13:19.560 --> 1:13:21.560]  Near to strategic bomber bases
[1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:23.560]  They're not, the Chinese government
[1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:25.560]  Should not be allowed to buy farms
[1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:27.560]  Next door to military bases
[1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:29.560]  Exactly
[1:13:29.560 --> 1:13:31.560]  They're coming, they're here
[1:13:31.560 --> 1:13:33.560]  And they're taking our guns at the very same time
[1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:35.560]  This is literally
[1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:37.560]  So that's all I gotta say
[1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:39.560]  We gotta get fricking, we gotta get fricking
[1:13:39.560 --> 1:13:41.560]  We gotta do something
[1:13:41.560 --> 1:13:43.560]  No, I agree Marcos, that's why the left's so arrogant
[1:13:43.560 --> 1:13:45.560]  They've been told this is their time
[1:13:45.560 --> 1:13:47.560]  This is their take down, that's why there's
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:49.560]  They think they're gonna win, they're not gonna win though brother
[1:13:49.560 --> 1:13:51.560]  God bless you
[1:13:51.560 --> 1:13:53.560]  Let's jam in another call
[1:13:53.560 --> 1:13:55.560]  Let's talk to Carla in Florida
[1:13:55.560 --> 1:13:57.560]  Carla, welcome
[1:13:57.560 --> 1:13:59.560]  Alex, I love you, you're a hero
[1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:01.560]  Single-handedly, you've enlightened all of us
[1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:03.560]  So my question is
[1:14:03.560 --> 1:14:05.560]  If I have this
[1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:07.560]  Concerned, probably a lot of other people
[1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:09.560]  Are worried about it, I want to support you
[1:14:09.560 --> 1:14:11.560]  In every way that I can, and I mean every way
[1:14:11.560 --> 1:14:13.560]  Especially for your legal fees
[1:14:13.560 --> 1:14:15.560]  But I want to go online
[1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:17.560]  And buy your products, but I'm a little bit afraid
[1:14:17.560 --> 1:14:19.560]  Of the security
[1:14:19.560 --> 1:14:21.560]  Online, not necessarily
[1:14:21.560 --> 1:14:23.560]  Right now, but even in the future
[1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:25.560]  Maybe that's stupid of me
[1:14:25.560 --> 1:14:27.560]  But I'm a little bit worried about it
[1:14:27.560 --> 1:14:29.560]  Can you quell my fears about that
[1:14:29.560 --> 1:14:31.560]  Well, I gotta tell you, the global social credit
[1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:33.560]  Score is coming in, they already know who's the
[1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:35.560]  Patriot who isn't, we gotta stop it
[1:14:35.560 --> 1:14:37.560]  And say no to them now, not try to hide from it
[1:14:37.560 --> 1:14:39.560]  And then hope they pass this over
[1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:41.560]  We gotta be all in now
[1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:43.560]  And not be intimidated and build our own economy
[1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:45.560]  Which is starting to happen, they're coming out with
[1:14:45.560 --> 1:14:47.560]  Processors that are Patriot owned
[1:14:47.560 --> 1:14:49.560]  Banks that are Patriot owned, gun groups that are Patriot owned
[1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:51.560]  We have to build our own economy, that's the answer
[1:14:51.560 --> 1:14:53.560]  Alright, I am a little bit chicken
[1:14:53.560 --> 1:14:55.560]  But I'm gonna do it, but the thing is
[1:14:55.560 --> 1:14:57.560]  The last fellow that said they're already here
[1:14:57.560 --> 1:14:59.560]  And you're agreeing with them
[1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:01.560]  So we gotta do something
[1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:03.560]  So why can't we figure out
[1:15:03.560 --> 1:15:05.560]  There's gotta be ex-old
[1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:07.560]  Army people
[1:15:07.560 --> 1:15:09.560]  That can get together and collaborate
[1:15:09.560 --> 1:15:11.560]  And figure out what we can do
[1:15:11.560 --> 1:15:13.560]  But is there no way to do that, is it silly
[1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:15.560]  You know, I knew some of those people
[1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:17.560]  Ten years ago and they all got killed
[1:15:17.560 --> 1:15:19.560]  Just for meeting
[1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:21.560]  And even talking about that kind of stuff
[1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:23.560]  They all got killed
[1:15:23.560 --> 1:15:25.560]  Listen, I wanna explain something to you
[1:15:25.560 --> 1:15:27.560]  Everybody thinks the military is like magic
[1:15:27.560 --> 1:15:29.560]  Military follows orders
[1:15:29.560 --> 1:15:31.560]  The top brass are globalist
[1:15:31.560 --> 1:15:33.560]  It's how what we do is consumers
[1:15:33.560 --> 1:15:35.560]  How we speak out, what we say
[1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:37.560]  There isn't one little magic thing we do
[1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:39.560]  That fixes this, it's everything we do together
[1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:41.560]  And supporting outlets like Info Wars
[1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:43.560]  They're the most important
[1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:45.560]  You see thousands of articles today trying to shut us down
[1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:47.560]  Why is that? They're scared of a vocal voice
[1:15:47.560 --> 1:15:49.560]  That's mobilizing people
[1:15:49.560 --> 1:15:51.560]  We need speech, thank you Carla
[1:15:51.560 --> 1:15:53.560]  Pete, Greg, JC,
[1:15:53.560 --> 1:16:19.560]  Lone Wolf, Jeff, Chris, Dave, Curtis, Mark, Lisa

[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:41.840]  of us you go to a Trump rally man it is the most diverse crowd ever unless you're
[1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:45.680]  in the middle of you know Oklahoma or like Pennsylvania where it's all white
[1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:50.920]  people but you go to like areas where it's a mixed group of people it's totally
[1:25:50.920 --> 1:25:54.360]  everybody we're hugging we're kissing we love each other we love our children
[1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:58.720]  and it gives me chills to think about how much love we've got and what we're
[1:25:58.720 --> 1:26:03.240]  gonna do together these people lying saying we're white supremacists people
[1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:06.560]  lying saying we're pedophiles when they're the pedophiles these people
[1:26:06.560 --> 1:26:10.640]  attacking us but that's who they are we can't even get mad at our enemies
[1:26:10.640 --> 1:26:15.800]  anymore because they're fallen and they're twisted and their disease and
[1:26:15.800 --> 1:26:20.560]  they're controlled when I was surrounded by those corrupt lawyers and the corrupt
[1:26:20.560 --> 1:26:26.120]  media and that corrupt judge I felt sorry for them I still didn't like them I
[1:26:26.120 --> 1:26:32.440]  didn't like being around them but it made me feel weak that we hadn't done
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:37.080]  enough to try to wake them up that they were so pathetic
[1:26:38.840 --> 1:26:44.400]  lone wolf in New York lone wolf thanks for holding yo I just want to say real
[1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:49.560]  quick I think viruses of black magic alive for the witch doctors and wacko
[1:26:49.560 --> 1:26:53.520]  scientists to use to control society with their BS problem solution there were
[1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:57.240]  no viruses one has never been isolated it is the biggest hoax ever perpetrated
[1:26:57.240 --> 1:27:01.400]  on society getting sick is your body detoxifying itself from toxins such as
[1:27:01.400 --> 1:27:06.760]  poison shots poison food poison air water etc well there's no doubt there's
[1:27:06.760 --> 1:27:10.520]  psychosomatic where people think they're sick so they get sick one person
[1:27:10.520 --> 1:27:13.480]  throws up everybody does and there's no doubt that they've directly connected
[1:27:13.480 --> 1:27:17.880]  to whales and things when they've been poisoned by an oil slick the scientists
[1:27:17.880 --> 1:27:21.800]  go a virus killed them know when their body gets weak and allows the virus to
[1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:25.640]  replicate so I think it's a little of both there but but I do agree with you
[1:27:25.640 --> 1:27:28.560]  that they admit major studies almost everybody getting sick and dying of
[1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:32.360]  covid took the shot so it's the poison of the shot that's killing them not
[1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:36.400]  supposedly the virus yeah real quick we're giving them plausible deniability
[1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:40.040]  we have to stop the way to free our world if we expose that viruses are a
[1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:43.760]  hoax and it's just your body detoxifying itself well there's no doubt the body
[1:27:43.760 --> 1:27:47.080]  kicks off things that look just like viruses and our viruses when it's
[1:27:47.080 --> 1:27:52.240]  detoxifying that's correct but if we if we keep this virus hoax going we don't
[1:27:52.240 --> 1:27:55.200]  expose us we're in big trouble because already they hopped to this monkey
[1:27:55.200 --> 1:27:58.240]  pox thing how to help could everyone come up with this conclusion that it's
[1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:01.960]  coming from gay sex when no when of course it's everything's coming from
[1:28:01.960 --> 1:28:05.280]  these poison shots that have been introduced exactly how obvious is it
[1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:09.960]  that no one's died in the US a monkey pox and they tell you it's the new deadly
[1:28:09.960 --> 1:28:14.000]  thing we got to be locked down I mean this is ridiculous it's absurd it's
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:18.360]  absurd and if we don't expose this lie we have a golden opportunity right now

[1:32:57.200 --> 1:33:04.000]  often now leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's
[1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:18.440]  Alex Jones big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[1:33:18.440 --> 1:33:38.120]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[1:33:38.120 --> 1:33:45.080]  at a 2019 food conference where topics included whether humans were too selfish
[1:33:45.080 --> 1:33:51.000]  to live sustainably an economist suggested cannibalism could be a viable
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:56.600]  solution for climate change and that we could start off by eating our pets
[1:33:56.600 --> 1:34:02.440]  school of economics professor Magnus Soderland says that eating human meat
[1:34:02.440 --> 1:34:07.000]  from the dead might help save the human race and that we could overcome the
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:13.280]  taboos against eating each other by simply trying it out and today a new
[1:34:13.280 --> 1:34:19.080]  company is boasting their lab-grown artisanal salami derived from human
[1:34:19.080 --> 1:34:24.120]  flesh and several articles normalizing cannibalism have recently been
[1:34:24.120 --> 1:34:29.960]  published by the mainstream media the Wikipedia page leads with the benefits
[1:34:29.960 --> 1:34:34.960]  of cannibalism where it says in environments where food availability is
[1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:40.480]  constrained individuals can receive extra nutrition and energy if they use
[1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:45.880]  other conspecific individuals as an additional food source this would in
[1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:50.600]  turn increase the survival rate of the cannibal and thus provide an
[1:34:50.600 --> 1:34:56.520]  evolutionary advantage in environments where food is scarce this may be true
[1:34:56.520 --> 1:35:01.200]  when there are no other food options but when there are it is never favorable
[1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:08.000]  for any species cannibals are at risk of related diseases such as Kuru disease
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:14.640]  similar to mad cow disease a neurological prion disease caused by
[1:35:14.640 --> 1:35:20.160]  cannibalistic consumption and when there are other food options cannibalism
[1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:25.120]  will always be the most challenging studies show that cannibals tend to
[1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:29.880]  eat the young because it is the easiest and they tend to hunt outside their own
[1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:35.320]  gene pool as a way of decreasing the competition cannibals are constantly at
[1:35:35.320 --> 1:35:41.080]  war with their own species and animals have evolved various protections against
[1:35:41.080 --> 1:35:47.240]  this barbarism cannibalism is the ultimate expression of barbarism the
[1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:53.560]  absence of civilization and culture extreme cruelty one could argue that
[1:35:53.560 --> 1:35:58.480]  the whole purpose of civilization is to increase the amount of food available to
[1:35:58.480 --> 1:36:03.200]  keep humanity from turning to cannibalism because who on earth wants
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:08.720]  barbarism over civility and compassion the New York Times published a piece
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:15.200]  entitled a taste for cannibalism and they promoted it by tweeting cannibalism
[1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:21.540]  has a time and a place some recent books films and shows suggest that the time
[1:36:21.540 --> 1:36:27.320]  is now the article promotes a list of recent movies and shows about
[1:36:27.320 --> 1:36:32.360]  cannibalism suggesting that perhaps we should all take the cue and give it a
[1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:40.200]  go as if pop culture decides the destiny of mankind and maybe it does there is
[1:36:40.200 --> 1:36:46.440]  definitely a herd mentality that finds comfort in blind obedience and will do
[1:36:46.440 --> 1:36:49.960]  whatever they are told by the authoritative state emerging from the
[1:36:49.960 --> 1:36:56.160]  shadows and the mainstream narrative is now normalizing cannibalism so that's
[1:36:56.160 --> 1:37:01.440]  what is coming if we continue accepting their offers it will be like the film
[1:37:01.440 --> 1:37:08.840]  Soylent Green which was set in 2022 or like the film Cloud Atlas where in a
[1:37:08.840 --> 1:37:16.160]  dystopian government processes the dead into food to feed the wretched masses
[1:37:16.160 --> 1:37:21.080]  reporting for Infowars this is Greg Reese
[1:37:22.440 --> 1:37:29.160]  cannibalism is what the new world order is on Greg Reese's report at band.video
[1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:36.040]  human cannibalism being pushed by the new green movement trying to get you to do
[1:37:36.040 --> 1:37:39.560]  anything you can to turn against your own common sense and to get you to not
[1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:44.120]  care about others that's the new world order is doing unbelievably criminal
[1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:46.720]  I'm gonna go back to your phone calls but I wanted to play a clip from two years
[1:37:46.720 --> 1:37:51.080]  ago that went mega viral hundreds of millions of views in context I said
[1:37:51.080 --> 1:37:56.200]  it's a modest proposal Jonathan Swift 300 years ago the Irish were starving
[1:37:56.200 --> 1:38:00.400]  death by the millions the English said don't feed them they have blockades on
[1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:05.080]  the island and so he was a one of the few nobility in England that was Irish
[1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:09.160]  and he said well why don't we just tell the Irish to grow their kids up like
[1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:14.360]  baby pigs like piglets and sell them to rich English men and ladies to be eaten
[1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:18.120]  so I said that's where we're going with the collapse of the world they want
[1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:22.480]  cannibalism was part of their plan not just eat bugs it's sell you on pure evil
[1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:29.480]  and they took it out of context but here's a clip I'll admit it I will eat my
[1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:33.600]  neighbors I'm not letting my kids die I'm just gonna be honest my superpowers
[1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:38.280]  being honest I've extrapolated this out and I won't have to for a few years I
[1:38:38.280 --> 1:38:41.800]  got food and stuff but I'm literally looking at my neighbors now I'm going I
[1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:45.280]  ready to hang them up and gut them and skin them and chop them up you know what
[1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:50.360]  I'm ready my daughters aren't starving to death I'll eat my neighbors see my
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:57.280]  superpowers being honest I'll eat your ass I will I'm combat model optimal
[1:38:57.280 --> 1:39:02.200]  self-sufficiency probably the leader the point is is if you thought about that
[1:39:02.200 --> 1:39:06.440]  yet because I'm somebody that thought I could fix this and I'm starting to think
[1:39:06.440 --> 1:39:12.200]  about having to eat my neighbors you think I like sizing up my neighbor how
[1:39:12.200 --> 1:39:18.800]  I'm gonna haul him up by a chain and top his ass up I'll do it my children
[1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:25.080]  aren't going hungry I will eat your ass that's why I want the globalist to know
[1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:32.400]  I will eat your ass first so the lefts always had the saying eat the rich but
[1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:38.360]  I made the point oh it was the worst thing ever let's go to your phone call
[1:39:38.360 --> 1:39:44.120]  thanks for holding Lisa in Rhode Island Lisa you're on the air hi Alex just
[1:39:44.120 --> 1:39:49.560]  want to send you and the crew many blessings thank you and I also want to
[1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:57.720]  give a big call out to MTG for her great great beach on CPAC back in you wish we
[1:39:57.720 --> 1:40:02.120]  had a few more backing you know I read she backed me I didn't know was it CPAC
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:06.960]  she did that at CPAC it was wonderful and let me tell you something she's
[1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:15.680]  wonderful and I wish we had men with cojones like she does however I did
[1:40:15.680 --> 1:40:23.040]  want to ask you a few questions where is governor our governor of Texas I watched
[1:40:23.040 --> 1:40:27.680]  this whole court trial with this judge who was more embarrassing than Liz
[1:40:27.680 --> 1:40:36.200]  Cheney with the January 6th trial where is the governor of Texas where's the
[1:40:36.200 --> 1:40:39.400]  district attorney why aren't they stepping in and saying whoa this doesn't
[1:40:39.400 --> 1:40:43.580]  happen in Texas don't forget the same Travis County courthouse indicted Rick
[1:40:43.580 --> 1:40:46.840]  Perry for veto in a bill totally legal he has that power remember they indicted
[1:40:46.840 --> 1:40:50.440]  Rick Perry took him two million bucks to beat it they indicted Tom DeLay Travis
[1:40:50.440 --> 1:40:54.280]  County which is where I live where my mom's from or family's been here for a
[1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:58.760]  long time we're based here we probably should not be based here I never thought
[1:40:58.760 --> 1:41:05.000]  it would get this bad but but yes this this this was not the judge said I was
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:09.880]  guilty she found me guilty and then told the jury to give them money and the
[1:41:09.880 --> 1:41:14.320]  jury sat there and took her orders I mean this is just incredible that it's
[1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:19.400]  reached this point but they are arrogant beyond belief okay my other question is
[1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:23.600]  where's Joe Rogan because he's slow walking all the information sub
[1:41:23.600 --> 1:41:27.320]  millions and millions of people that he could save lives with you know I had
[1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:30.240]  dinner with Joe a few weeks ago with Eddie Bravo Joe's a great guy but Joe's
[1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:34.160]  gonna play it safe and I you know he did good on the vaccines and he's come a
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:40.200]  long way but we can't expect Joe Rogan to save us we don't want Joe Rogan to
[1:41:40.200 --> 1:41:44.320]  save us but at the same time I mean he has millions and millions of followers
[1:41:44.320 --> 1:41:49.400]  that he's proud of having you know let's let's step up and say you know defend
[1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:54.800]  your friends say the truth let's get it out there for the for the people that
[1:41:54.800 --> 1:41:59.560]  really need to hear this and that listen to Joe Rogan I know I hear you I mean I
[1:41:59.560 --> 1:42:04.560]  wish that Joe I wish Joe would go further I'm not my brother's keeper I like Joe
[1:42:04.560 --> 1:42:11.080]  a lot and I've known Joe for 25 years and a lot of people are pissed at Joe for
[1:42:11.080 --> 1:42:17.520]  not doing more and but again you know you he's he's already come a long way so
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:21.120]  I'll leave it at that thank you Lisa I got to one caller that segment but I'd
[1:42:21.120 --> 1:42:24.800]  forgotten I had it circled on my sheet to play that cannibalism clip so we got
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:30.680]  to that but I promise when we come back we're gonna come roaring in with Craig and
[1:42:30.680 --> 1:42:35.520]  Dave and everybody else is patiently holding after this quick break but

[1:45:13.160 --> 1:45:17.960]  returns 50 different answers and almost all of them just screw you over
[1:45:17.960 --> 1:45:21.560]  especially the big firms and the big tax groups because they're part of the
[1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:24.920]  system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing
[1:45:24.920 --> 1:45:29.200]  this so it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out

[1:47:12.280 --> 1:47:15.760]  welcome back to Alex Jones show your calls are coming up in a moment but since
[1:47:15.760 --> 1:47:22.160]  callers mentioned it here's some of MTG's speech at CPAC
[1:47:22.160 --> 1:47:27.320]  you want to know something like somebody like alex jones who did say
[1:47:27.320 --> 1:47:34.080]  some things but yet he is being politically persecuted right now and
[1:47:34.080 --> 1:47:38.560]  being forced to pay out millions and millions of dollars and and no one no
[1:47:38.560 --> 1:47:42.040]  one agrees with what he said but what we're tired of is the political
[1:47:42.040 --> 1:47:46.960]  persecution I'd like to know when the Democrats and the liars in the media and
[1:47:46.960 --> 1:47:51.400]  the people that canceled all of you and me on big tech when are they gonna pay
[1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:58.840]  all of us millions of dollars right but to to ruin Alex Jones he didn't build
[1:47:58.840 --> 1:48:04.600]  his info wars on that right he built it on a lot of other news and Alex Jones
[1:48:04.600 --> 1:48:08.040]  has been right pretty much most of the time I know everyone freaks out if I
[1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:12.280]  say that but Alex Jones has been right of course except on Sandy Hook but
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:17.400]  really though look at what's happened 45 million dollars and then I mean we can
[1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:24.480]  go down list and then she went on to say we should be supported we are a rallying
[1:48:24.480 --> 1:48:28.560]  point and they believe if they can shut us down they can shut you down that's
[1:48:28.560 --> 1:48:33.240]  why everybody asked me will you stay on air and I'll talk about it some of the
[1:48:33.240 --> 1:48:37.520]  start of the next hour after they calls but yes we know the law we know what
[1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:44.280]  they're doing we have a plan to stay on air but it is literally up to this crew
[1:48:44.280 --> 1:48:49.200]  myself whether I want to keep doing this and you the listeners well I want to
[1:48:49.200 --> 1:48:52.520]  keep doing it I want to I don't want to stop fighting the crew doesn't want to

[1:49:42.040 --> 1:49:48.440]  talk to who's up first here that would be Dave in Pennsylvania Dave welcome I
[1:49:48.440 --> 1:49:54.160]  do an Alex I love info wars love the products I love MTG real quick Eric
[1:49:54.160 --> 1:50:01.000]  Adams typical liberal loves the legals for thee but not for me you know we have
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:04.880]  the here right here in Erie Pennsylvania or certain neighborhoods that are you
[1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:07.840]  know they love certain people but not in their neighborhoods but I like to talk
[1:50:07.840 --> 1:50:12.320]  about the judge in that particular case I'm a former retired law enforcement
[1:50:12.320 --> 1:50:17.280]  officer you know and I watch that trial I watch every minute of it and every time
[1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:22.960]  that you know the plaintiff the plaintiff objected I could sit here and I could
[1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:27.200]  say I know exactly what the judge is gonna rule sustained sustained sustained
[1:50:27.200 --> 1:50:32.560]  but every time the your attorney objected overruled overruled overruled you
[1:50:32.560 --> 1:50:37.440]  know if you didn't realize that that was totally biased trial you have to be a
[1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:41.400]  blind you know and I remember you mentioned something about her hair
[1:50:41.400 --> 1:50:45.360]  being blue but I remember looking at her that she looked like it was black what's
[1:50:45.360 --> 1:50:51.120]  what's the gig on that Alex on her Facebook she says she's an SJW and
[1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:55.160]  it's her during the lockdown she dyed her hair bright blue another thing is
[1:50:55.160 --> 1:51:02.000]  folks want to have rainbow colored hair the point is she is a total Soros SJW
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:06.040]  that barred us from showing our financials that showed that we're on the
[1:51:06.040 --> 1:51:11.200]  edge of insolvency and bankruptcy and then she let some fake economists say I
[1:51:11.200 --> 1:51:17.560]  had 270 million dollars total lie and then the lawyers got up on it and said
[1:51:17.560 --> 1:51:23.200]  you notice he didn't put any on the evidence the jury well that's me well
[1:51:23.200 --> 1:51:27.920]  here's there's the key they said because he doesn't have evidence he has 270
[1:51:27.920 --> 1:51:32.000]  million dollars so they she allowed them to lie she blocked us from evidence and
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:36.560]  then allowed their lawyers to say we didn't put on evidence I've talked to
[1:51:36.560 --> 1:51:40.560]  a lot of top lawyers they say they've never seen fraud of that level in a
[1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:45.200]  court in America and I agree with that 100% you know like I said I've been a
[1:51:45.200 --> 1:51:49.640]  little formal law enforcement officer I never seen such bias in my life you know
[1:51:49.640 --> 1:51:53.480]  I wouldn't be surprised if I went to an Antifa rally which I'll never do but
[1:51:53.480 --> 1:51:57.760]  she'd be probably right there in a front with her with her signs in her you know
[1:51:57.760 --> 1:52:05.200]  her talking about Pro Antifa or you know what have you oh yeah listen to this
[1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:09.600]  listen to this Dave a week and a half ago I saw on Twitter images of her with
[1:52:09.600 --> 1:52:13.480]  pink hair blue hair rainbow flags all this I thought well that's probably fake
[1:52:13.480 --> 1:52:17.560]  then the crew brought me see if you can pull it up guys just in 10 seconds notice
[1:52:17.560 --> 1:52:23.800]  it's her personal Facebook Antifa SJW you cannot make this up but she was
[1:52:23.800 --> 1:52:28.120]  funded by Soros you know in Austin we have one of the worst DA's as bad as
[1:52:28.120 --> 1:52:34.680]  San Francisco he calls everybody comrades he says he's a communist and he
[1:52:34.680 --> 1:52:40.120]  lets people out these two guys shot up a bunch of people downtown they let him
[1:52:40.120 --> 1:52:45.480]  out of jail the day after sir to be perfectly honest with you Alex I never
[1:52:45.480 --> 1:52:51.480]  knew that I just assumed she'd be an Antifa follower just by looking at her
[1:52:51.480 --> 1:52:55.920]  interactions at that trial I'll have to check what you check out what you're
[1:52:55.920 --> 1:52:59.880]  talking to me about right now but to be perfectly honest I never knew that I
[1:52:59.880 --> 1:53:03.600]  didn't either I didn't either God bless you sir I appreciate your call but let's
[1:53:03.600 --> 1:53:08.760]  be clear she found me guilty herself and then told the jury I was guilty and
[1:53:08.760 --> 1:53:14.040]  then wouldn't let us put on evidence but then they had our text messages and
[1:53:14.040 --> 1:53:18.720]  our emails and all our stuff but oh we didn't give them anything that's the new
[1:53:18.720 --> 1:53:22.760]  model they convicted Steve Bannon three weeks ago they wouldn't let him cross
[1:53:22.760 --> 1:53:27.720]  examine witnesses against him it's the same thing all right let's take another
[1:53:27.720 --> 1:53:35.200]  call here Greg in Colorado Greg welcome thank you I have so tried to get this
[1:53:35.200 --> 1:53:41.800]  information to you before your trial to no avail so here we go the next time you
[1:53:41.800 --> 1:53:46.680]  go have any kind of a trial the one way you can turn this put this kangaroo court
[1:53:46.680 --> 1:53:51.360]  into a quarter of record and if the judge doesn't see this happening boy you
[1:53:51.360 --> 1:53:55.840]  really got him right right off the bat you can take him right off the bench and
[1:53:55.840 --> 1:54:02.360]  that is you go to another county in the state and you hire a court recorder so
[1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:09.000]  that you can have your own legal minutes of the court now most judges and I see
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:11.960]  somebody taking some record they'll ask about it you just say well this is my
[1:54:11.960 --> 1:54:16.640]  my court recorder that I hired and their license and so on and there's nothing
[1:54:16.640 --> 1:54:23.600]  they can do about it nothing at all that judge won't unless they really are
[1:54:23.600 --> 1:54:29.040]  suicidal will just in their career we'll mind their P's and Q's and they will
[1:54:29.040 --> 1:54:34.120]  everything will be completely legal I guarantee it's funny you say that she kept
[1:54:34.120 --> 1:54:38.720]  cutting the YouTube feed during during when we were speaking so a judge can say
[1:54:38.720 --> 1:54:43.760]  no cameras but can they turn the video feed on and off yes but they can't they
[1:54:43.760 --> 1:54:49.080]  can't stop that legal court recorder from getting you a completely totally 100%
[1:54:49.080 --> 1:54:55.240]  legal copy that the judge can himself or herself cannot manipulate and so they
[1:54:55.240 --> 1:55:01.240]  know this and you turn the whole courtroom into a court of record and they
[1:55:01.240 --> 1:55:05.680]  are they bind their the P's and Q's they follow the law it's just a whole
[1:55:05.680 --> 1:55:10.480]  different situation it saves you a lot of money a lot of time no you're right
[1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:13.720]  because the amount of money we're paying for transcripts is tens of thousands of
[1:55:13.720 --> 1:55:16.920]  dollars that's a great point I could have hired a court reporter done it for half
[1:55:16.920 --> 1:55:20.640]  the price and had my own record amazing point Greg thank you all right let's
[1:55:20.640 --> 1:55:25.320]  take another caller here let's go ahead and talk to Curtis in Michigan go ahead
[1:55:25.320 --> 1:55:31.000]  Curtis hey Alex how you doing good brother go
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:34.720]  ahead been listening for a long time man and I really appreciate what you're
[1:55:34.720 --> 1:55:40.200]  doing I think what's going on here my own opinion is that info wars some of
[1:55:40.200 --> 1:55:43.160]  these other ones out there they're a handful of ones that are not on the
[1:55:43.160 --> 1:55:46.520]  dark web that people go look for you know like in their own accord they want
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:49.760]  to shut you down because you want the only ones out there indexed in the
[1:55:49.760 --> 1:55:53.240]  regular web that most people can go look at it's imperative to understand that
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:57.000]  this thing that this went down for your Sandy Hook thing they got to get rid of
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:01.400]  you if you weren't anything worth of note they wouldn't be doing this they
[1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:05.920]  just writes you off I support you these people need to understand they need to
[1:56:05.920 --> 1:56:09.760]  support you you weren't the only ones out there helping us right now and if
[1:56:09.760 --> 1:56:15.120]  they don't support this store and keep you going this is imperative keep playing
[1:56:15.120 --> 1:56:19.200]  all those clips keep playing all of your advertisements for your store because we
[1:56:19.200 --> 1:56:24.360]  got to have you brother well God bless you what they're doing well I was on
[1:56:24.360 --> 1:56:27.960]  Steve Bannon show today and he made the point it really is true he said Alex
[1:56:27.960 --> 1:56:33.960]  Jones is is been over the horizon writing the talking point so what really
[1:56:33.960 --> 1:56:38.200]  comes true and Alex Jones is the main influencer of the resistance and I never
[1:56:38.200 --> 1:56:41.800]  wanted to have that mail I never thought that would happen but for whatever
[1:56:41.800 --> 1:56:46.240]  reason we've got the enemy's number and they know that nine times out of ten it's
[1:56:46.240 --> 1:56:50.400]  us that calls them beforehand and we've blown so many their operations so
[1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:54.280]  whatever happens to me it was worth it we've had an incredible run but I want
[1:56:54.280 --> 1:56:58.120]  to stay in the fight Curtis people need to do what they need to do to keep you
[1:56:58.120 --> 1:57:02.080]  and keep you in the loop here donate to the store do what you can as Patriots
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:05.720]  Alex is one of the only ones left that is the tip of the spear and I'm doing my
[1:57:05.720 --> 1:57:08.120]  part everyone should do theirs I don't want to keep you because you got other
[1:57:08.120 --> 1:57:10.720]  people better than me they want to say better things for brother man I love you
[1:57:10.720 --> 1:57:14.200]  keep doing what you're doing I love you brother I'm not gonna stop look I knew
[1:57:14.200 --> 1:57:19.360]  this would happen I knew this was coming I expected this now they're trying to put
[1:57:19.360 --> 1:57:26.000]  me in prison it's okay just you guys keep fighting no matter what happens I'm not
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:29.920]  gonna back down I don't know how to do it these people are too evil in fact they
[1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:34.440]  were so evil in this trial that I was a little depressed now I'm super fired up
[1:57:34.440 --> 1:57:38.040]  knowing I'm a hundred percent right all right hour number three your phone calls
[1:57:38.040 --> 1:57:43.600]  big breaking news and a special guest all coming up I'll break down the future of
[1:57:43.600 --> 1:57:46.640]  info wars straight ahead
[1:57:48.160 --> 1:57:52.720]  the great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government
[1:57:52.720 --> 1:57:57.160]  doesn't want you to read that most of the big powerful companies trying to
[1:57:57.160 --> 1:58:01.440]  control your life the big tech companies they don't want you to read this book
[1:58:01.440 --> 1:58:06.000]  they want to control what you think what you do what you read but you don't
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:09.960]  want that and Alex Jones doesn't want that and this book shows you what's

[2:00:11.840 --> 2:00:19.160]  defiance to tyranny mark in Minnesota you're on the air Alex thanks for taking
[2:00:19.160 --> 2:00:24.080]  my call yes sir I've been listening to you for about 12 years and twice a day in
[2:00:24.080 --> 2:00:27.160]  case I miss something I think I'm a candidate for your most dedicated
[2:00:27.160 --> 2:00:32.280]  listener Alex I first want to thank you for your tremendous work exposing the
[2:00:32.280 --> 2:00:38.640]  genocide jet Alex people owe you their lives by the million however I have
[2:00:38.640 --> 2:00:42.000]  a couple suggestions on things that you're missing out on actually several
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  but I'll limit it to two that we really need to hear from you first you've never
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:53.720]  covered the proven and I say proven fraud moon landing Barts of Ralph would be a
[2:00:53.720 --> 2:00:58.680]  great guest for you to have on the show and discuss his book moon man which
[2:00:58.680 --> 2:01:03.720]  discloses the filming which took place in 68 and the names of the people present
[2:01:03.720 --> 2:01:08.400]  secondly you've done a great job keeping everyone informed on the awful crimes the
[2:01:08.400 --> 2:01:12.440]  globalists in the left have committed however your listeners get it so
[2:01:12.440 --> 2:01:17.120]  continually talk talking about it is it's overkill Alex when you're constantly
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:21.360]  hitting us with bad news we need you to take charge on a solution and that
[2:01:21.360 --> 2:01:24.920]  solution has been outlined by Wayne Allen Root in one of your following
[2:01:24.920 --> 2:01:29.680]  Tuesday programs where he talks about the session however he's only half rate
[2:01:29.680 --> 2:01:35.120]  we first need state reorganization followed by new states then the session
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:41.080]  Alex please discuss those subjects thank you yes sir look I don't know what
[2:01:41.080 --> 2:01:44.880]  happened with the moon or all that we have such big issues in front of us
[2:01:44.880 --> 2:01:47.960]  right now that's why I haven't focused on it but I hear what you're saying all
[2:01:47.960 --> 2:01:54.680]  right Jesse in Texas you're on the air go ahead hello yes Jesse welcome yes

[2:05:02.760 --> 2:05:08.600]  got these rants and all that what they miss is that this guy's ahead of the
[2:05:08.600 --> 2:05:13.480]  curve on so many different topics of signal not noise if you look at the
[2:05:13.480 --> 2:05:20.320]  signal and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC and we'll do what Alex Jones
[2:05:20.320 --> 2:05:25.120]  put out there versus what your collective body has put out there and if

[2:05:53.160 --> 2:06:04.160]  copy now at Amazon or info or store dot com every major globalist publication
[2:06:04.160 --> 2:06:09.720]  all the comedy shows all the newspapers all the local TV stations all the
[2:06:09.720 --> 2:06:14.460]  national news foreign news Alex Jones is a fraud Alex Jones is bad they're
[2:06:14.460 --> 2:06:19.760]  saying you're bad they're attacking you here's John Oliver last week's news
[2:06:19.760 --> 2:06:24.920]  today trying to demonize me with edited clips from the show trial they just had
[2:06:24.920 --> 2:06:28.920]  we're gonna start tonight with Alex Jones a man who boldly answered the
[2:06:28.920 --> 2:06:34.280]  question what if Grimace were a proud boy because Jones has had himself quite
[2:06:34.280 --> 2:06:40.200]  the week Jones under pressure found liable in three separate defamation
[2:06:40.200 --> 2:06:45.160]  lawsuits brought by the families of ten victims of the Sandy Hook massacre the
[2:06:45.160 --> 2:06:50.960]  jury for this case determining how much Jones must pay for his lies Sandy
[2:06:50.960 --> 2:06:58.640]  Hook is a synthetic completely fake with actors in my view manufacturer look
[2:06:58.640 --> 2:07:02.200]  obviously those claims were disgusting but they shouldn't really be that
[2:07:02.200 --> 2:07:05.680]  surprising coming from a guy who literally named his platform after going
[2:07:05.680 --> 2:07:10.920]  to war with information guess what Alex your foot info and this time info
[2:07:10.920 --> 2:07:15.920]  f***ing one not that Jones has put up much of a fight so far judges have
[2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:19.320]  actually issued default judgments against him in multiple suits regarding
[2:07:19.320 --> 2:07:23.120]  his Sandy Hook remarks after he failed to comply with court order so the trial
[2:07:23.120 --> 2:07:27.040]  this week was the first of three in which the only question is determining
[2:07:27.040 --> 2:07:31.680]  how much he'll have to pay and the way he's handled this trial is almost a
[2:07:31.680 --> 2:07:36.720]  masterclass in what not to do in court starting with the fact that he lied so
[2:07:36.720 --> 2:07:44.560]  many times the exasperated judge had to say this it seems absurd to instruct you
[2:07:44.560 --> 2:07:51.480]  again that you must tell the truth while you testify you must tell the truth
[2:07:51.480 --> 2:07:59.360]  while you testify this is not your show do you understand yes or no do you
[2:07:59.360 --> 2:08:05.840]  understand what I have said yes I believe I said true so yes you believe
[2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:12.280]  everything you say is true but it is not make something true that is that is
[2:08:12.280 --> 2:08:17.000]  what we're doing here and you can understand her frustration there when
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:21.120]  it comes to rules that a judge doesn't expect to have to spell out don't lie
[2:08:21.120 --> 2:08:25.400]  in court is right up there with you have to leave your beer outside it's not
[2:08:25.400 --> 2:08:29.320]  admissible evidence if it happened in a dream and we do not celebrate Halloween
[2:08:29.320 --> 2:08:33.640]  in here that's not the only way that Jones provoked the judge because he's
[2:08:33.640 --> 2:08:37.720]  also continued to appear on info wars which has among other things baselessly
[2:08:37.720 --> 2:08:42.520]  linked her to pedophilia and shown this image of her engulfed in flames he
[2:08:42.520 --> 2:08:46.440]  also went after the jury questioning their intelligence and implying that his
[2:08:46.440 --> 2:08:50.200]  political enemies had handpicked blue-collar people who were ill-equipped
[2:08:50.200 --> 2:08:55.480]  to decide what monetary damages he must pay he even engaged in the pettiest kind
[2:08:55.480 --> 2:09:01.080]  of behavior like this
[2:09:28.240 --> 2:09:32.360]  just her side of that interaction from spit it out so I don't want to see the
[2:09:32.360 --> 2:09:37.040]  inside of your mouth you assume she was talking to a a small child or be a doc
[2:09:37.040 --> 2:09:41.000]  you would not guess she was talking to professional conspiracies slash grown
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:46.040]  man Alex Jones until at least guess D that is pathetic enough even before you
[2:09:46.040 --> 2:09:50.040]  learn that later that day you could very clearly see him turning away from the
[2:09:50.040 --> 2:09:58.120]  judge and putting something in his mouth and that was a cough drop that the
[2:09:58.120 --> 2:10:04.760]  judge gave me as part of her act that she cares so folks that's what they do
[2:10:04.760 --> 2:10:09.000]  they they engineer this for gotcha moments to sell the idea of a show
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:13.320]  trial where she finds me guilty up front and then bars us bring forward evidence
[2:10:13.320 --> 2:10:17.720]  it's a fraud and just like their attempts to platform us four years ago
[2:10:17.720 --> 2:10:21.800]  failed this will fail if you continue to back what we're doing they are so
[2:10:21.800 --> 2:10:26.120]  incredibly pissed at the whole world is turning against them and their puppet
[2:10:26.120 --> 2:10:32.920]  president Joe Biden burning in hell so opinion red state reports the Alex Jones
[2:10:32.920 --> 2:10:38.080]  verdict is wrong and dangerous yeah Alex Jones's phone matters beyond the
[2:10:38.080 --> 2:10:42.360]  sandy hook MSNBC it's got all the January 6th stuff nope they didn't get my
[2:10:42.360 --> 2:10:47.640]  phone it's not true it's made up they got some text messages 2019 January
[2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:52.120]  6th committee request condensate on his phone good nothing there and it goes on
[2:10:52.120 --> 2:10:58.000]  and on on and on and on jack the subject gets it right he says they're using Alex
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:01.800]  Jones for freedom of speech if you don't speak out against this you will be
[2:11:01.800 --> 2:11:08.160]  next and now this one of the biggest newspapers in Italy yesterday runs with
[2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:13.640]  a headline Alex Jones had child porn content in his text messages revealed by
[2:11:13.640 --> 2:11:20.480]  his lawyer total lie not true shows how desperate they are talk about defamation
[2:11:20.480 --> 2:11:25.160]  and then all these leftists picked it up like Don Wilson begging for a lawsuit
[2:11:25.160 --> 2:11:29.300]  child porn found in documents Alex Jones sent to lawyers and families court
[2:11:29.300 --> 2:11:34.400]  filing says Jones should be arrested immediately files sent by Alex Jones
[2:11:34.400 --> 2:11:41.560]  include child porn now this goes back to just the last few days what are they
[2:11:41.560 --> 2:11:45.880]  talking about child porn found in documents Alex Jones sent to lawyers
[2:11:45.880 --> 2:11:52.080]  sending a family's court filing says 2019 the judge ordered us in Connecticut to
[2:11:52.080 --> 2:11:56.600]  turn over 200,000 plus emails with key term searches we turned it over but they
[2:11:56.600 --> 2:12:01.240]  defaulted a saying we didn't then in hidden messages in unopened emails there
[2:12:01.240 --> 2:12:05.680]  was child porn the FBI said we were the victim of it they use that to recycle
[2:12:05.680 --> 2:12:11.880]  it and claim my phone has it talk about liars ladies and gentlemen that too
[2:12:11.880 --> 2:12:16.520]  these people are so let me tell you where info wars is right now we're like
[2:12:16.520 --> 2:12:24.000]  the American people surrounded demonized lied about attacks because they fear us
[2:12:24.640 --> 2:12:30.800]  we have declared bankruptcy because they're claiming in court we have hundreds
[2:12:30.800 --> 2:12:36.360]  of millions of dollars we believe the federal courts aren't hand-picked they're
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:41.160]  not perfect by the Democrats and Soros operatives like in Travis County famous
[2:12:41.160 --> 2:12:46.200]  for a traditional tyranny and Connecticut that way they can't claim we
[2:12:46.200 --> 2:12:49.760]  have hundreds of millions of dollars but we went in last Friday with the
[2:12:49.760 --> 2:12:54.520]  bankruptcy filing of how much money actually had how much money info wars
[2:12:54.520 --> 2:12:58.480]  had and she said you're barred from showing that to the jury you're barred
[2:12:58.480 --> 2:13:04.440]  from defenses and then let the other side put on their expert to say I have
[2:13:04.440 --> 2:13:09.640]  two hundred and seventy million dollars and all these other lies to make the
[2:13:09.640 --> 2:13:13.480]  jury have a big verdict and act like we don't need support and we've got all
[2:13:13.480 --> 2:13:19.320]  this money but it gets worse then the judge the little vampire bat in a black
[2:13:19.320 --> 2:13:27.760]  outfit then the judge the so-called judge let the plaintiff's lawyers the
[2:13:27.760 --> 2:13:33.520]  ambulance chasers say Jones didn't put on evidence of our claims of 270 million
[2:13:33.520 --> 2:13:38.560]  because he doesn't have it that is the biggest traditional misconduct experts
[2:13:38.560 --> 2:13:41.960]  we've talked to have ever seen won't let us put on evidence then let the other
[2:13:41.960 --> 2:13:48.280]  side say he has no evidence so here's where we are we're in bankruptcy they're
[2:13:48.280 --> 2:13:51.040]  not gonna be able to shut us down like they want not gonna be able to claim we
[2:13:51.040 --> 2:13:54.080]  have all this money we don't have but if we don't have money to keep the
[2:13:54.080 --> 2:14:00.320]  operation going improve we're solvent then we get shut down see how that works
[2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:05.920]  they say the judge already found me guilty so we owe these debts well under
[2:14:05.920 --> 2:14:09.080]  Texas Statue there'll be a fraction of what they claim less than six million
[2:14:09.080 --> 2:14:15.080]  dollars and the same in future trials so we're in bankruptcy proving that we
[2:14:15.080 --> 2:14:19.720]  don't have all this money proving what they're saying is a lie so they can't
[2:14:19.720 --> 2:14:26.480]  make these claims and that's why we've done this is to call them on what they're
[2:14:26.480 --> 2:14:30.040]  doing but even when we have the bankruptcy documents that are as good as
[2:14:30.040 --> 2:14:34.560]  Golden Court the judge won't let us show it in this trial or the next trial oh
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:40.680]  they got three of these set to go after me with the same judge so as long as we
[2:14:40.680 --> 2:14:46.360]  have money to pay the payroll and continue on air and be solvent we will
[2:14:46.360 --> 2:14:50.800]  stay on here they want to shut us down they said they're closing arguments we
[2:14:50.800 --> 2:14:55.200]  want to silence him we want him off air you want to send a message we want to
[2:14:55.200 --> 2:14:59.080]  shut down everybody else that criticizes us we want to be the only ones that can
[2:14:59.080 --> 2:15:02.800]  speak the only ones that have free speech they said that Gregory says a
[2:15:02.800 --> 2:15:08.440]  report on banned out video that shows the clips so think about that they're
[2:15:08.440 --> 2:15:12.920]  saying our mission is to shut him down well in bankruptcy they can't do that as
[2:15:12.920 --> 2:15:17.480]  long as we're solvent the problem is we're barely solvent barely paying the
[2:15:17.480 --> 2:15:24.440]  bills so info wars is strong that will continue on for years if you support us

[2:20:25.840 --> 2:20:31.720]  censorship and lies and judicial tyranny then Laura Loomer she's running for
[2:20:31.720 --> 2:20:35.440]  Congress she's got a really good chance of winning I want to talk about her
[2:20:35.440 --> 2:20:39.880]  about the war on free speech our broken legal system and how she's set to win
[2:20:39.880 --> 2:20:44.800]  how we need to replace rhinos with American first fighters and so much
[2:20:44.800 --> 2:20:50.600]  more she's got this election coming up in 15 days Laura Loomer great to have you

[2:20:55.360 --> 2:21:01.640]  want to start here well you know we are officially 15 days away from the Florida
[2:21:01.640 --> 2:21:06.880]  Republican primary and I am set to win my primary I switch districts I know a
[2:21:06.880 --> 2:21:10.880]  lot of people know I ran last election season down in South Florida but we just
[2:21:10.880 --> 2:21:15.120]  had a redistricting year here in the state of Florida and I moved to Central
[2:21:15.120 --> 2:21:19.560]  Florida and I'm now running in District 11 which is a majority red
[2:21:19.560 --> 2:21:24.400]  Republican seat which means whoever wins this primary in 15 days on August 23rd
[2:21:24.400 --> 2:21:28.680]  is going to be the next member of the United States Congress and I'm
[2:21:28.680 --> 2:21:33.360]  premiering a pro impeachment rhino named Daniel Webster here in Florida's 11th
[2:21:33.360 --> 2:21:37.680]  District we have out fundraised him we have outworked him and this is the year
[2:21:37.680 --> 2:21:42.560]  for the America first hostile takeover of the Republican Party and I'm gonna win
[2:21:42.560 --> 2:21:46.600]  Alex I'm gonna win that's even when mainstream news is saying so they think
[2:21:46.600 --> 2:21:50.880]  MTG was dangerous I can't wait till you're in Congress but we got to push
[2:21:50.880 --> 2:21:56.240]  it over the top here yeah and Alex hopefully you know when I when I win my
[2:21:56.240 --> 2:21:59.360]  election and I become the first he platformed candidate in United States
[2:21:59.360 --> 2:22:03.200]  history you know I would love to serve on the House Energy Commerce Committee
[2:22:03.200 --> 2:22:07.560]  in Congress so that I can take on the big tech social media tyrants and I
[2:22:07.560 --> 2:22:14.240]  would love to personally invite you to testify in Congress you know since you
[2:22:14.240 --> 2:22:18.920]  as well as myself we are probably the two most censored and banned individuals
[2:22:18.920 --> 2:22:22.960]  in the entire country if not the entire world and I look forward to
[2:22:22.960 --> 2:22:26.640]  platforming your voice in the United States Congress I can't wait well why do
[2:22:26.640 --> 2:22:30.360]  you think they singled because it really is true you and I out you're like man
[2:22:30.360 --> 2:22:36.920]  from Uber Airbnb myself included why are they so why do they pick you and I up
[2:22:36.920 --> 2:22:41.240]  front four years ago to do that too because we're truth seekers and we're
[2:22:41.240 --> 2:22:46.280]  ahead of the curve you know I can't help but notice that CPAC just came to an
[2:22:46.280 --> 2:22:51.600]  end in Texas a couple days ago right and you you and I were banned from CPAC
[2:22:51.600 --> 2:22:55.800]  years ago and now of course you see people talking about the issues that we
[2:22:55.800 --> 2:23:00.080]  are talking about communism globalism the New World Order takeover big tech
[2:23:00.080 --> 2:23:03.320]  social media censorship election interference and these are all things
[2:23:03.320 --> 2:23:07.680]  that we were first to talk about years ago Alex you and I were sitting together
[2:23:07.680 --> 2:23:12.320]  in the big tech social media hearing in the back of the room when Jack Dorsey
[2:23:12.320 --> 2:23:16.920]  was lying to Congress and Republicans were allowing him to get away with
[2:23:16.920 --> 2:23:22.760]  perjury and so I think that you and I really have been trailblazers especially
[2:23:22.760 --> 2:23:27.800]  when it comes to waking people up about big tech social media censorship and we
[2:23:27.800 --> 2:23:34.080]  are probably the best I would say we are the best journalists in America today
[2:23:34.080 --> 2:23:38.800]  the best investigative journalists alive with also James O'Keefe you were in an
[2:23:38.800 --> 2:23:43.560]  uphill battle last year and still barely lost but the numbers are you're set to
[2:23:43.560 --> 2:23:48.080]  win I can't think of something more fantastic and a bigger nightmare for
[2:23:48.080 --> 2:23:51.000]  the globalist than to have you in Congress how do we make sure you win
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:56.600]  tell folks about the race well if you live in Orange County if you live in
[2:23:56.600 --> 2:23:59.760]  Lake County if you live in Sumter County which of course includes the
[2:23:59.760 --> 2:24:03.080]  villages the largest retirement community and at the United States of
[2:24:03.080 --> 2:24:08.240]  America or if you live in Polk City in East Lakeland and Polk County you can
[2:24:08.240 --> 2:24:12.200]  vote for me early voting in Orange County began today and so if you live in
[2:24:12.200 --> 2:24:16.520]  Orange County you can go to the polls as of today and vote but election day is on
[2:24:16.520 --> 2:24:21.360]  August 23rd and I need everybody who is registered Republican to get out and vote
[2:24:21.360 --> 2:24:25.640]  for me in the upcoming Florida Republican primary this is our race to win and
[2:24:25.640 --> 2:24:30.200]  we will win as long as Patriots show up to replace the pro impeachment voter
[2:24:30.200 --> 2:24:36.080]  fraud denying globalist Rhino who I am running against and so I'm asking for
[2:24:36.080 --> 2:24:39.960]  their support we also need to raise money so if you're watching if you could
[2:24:39.960 --> 2:24:43.680]  please donate whether it's five ten a hundred a thousand or a max donation of
[2:24:43.680 --> 2:24:49.160]  2900 every dollar counts because the NRCC and Kevin McCarthy have it out for
[2:24:49.160 --> 2:24:53.840]  me this last week they were running fake robo calls Alex saying that I'm a
[2:24:53.840 --> 2:24:57.160]  Democrat I mean how laughable is this they were literally running robo calls
[2:24:57.160 --> 2:25:00.880]  in the district telling voters that you're about as populist right wing as
[2:25:00.880 --> 2:25:07.360]  you can get yeah I'm a hardcore right wing nationalist okay I'm a proud
[2:25:07.360 --> 2:25:10.480]  American I'm a constitutional conservative and I don't have a communist
[2:25:10.480 --> 2:25:15.480]  bone in my body so but but they lied to the voters what do you make of the
[2:25:15.480 --> 2:25:20.760]  San is getting more and more hardcore and like firing the Soros prosecutor that
[2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:27.760]  is very exciting yeah look here in the state of Florida our governor and you
[2:25:27.760 --> 2:25:32.000]  know people running for Congress including myself and the citizens of the
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:36.160]  state of Florida we are for law and order and we don't want our free red
[2:25:36.160 --> 2:25:40.640]  state to turn into the blue state that so many of these people moved from here
[2:25:40.640 --> 2:25:43.920]  into Florida over the last two years when we saw these unconstitutional
[2:25:43.920 --> 2:25:48.120]  Andrew Coney and lockdowns and mandates and the swell of crime all
[2:25:48.120 --> 2:25:52.120]  throughout American cities and so we we need more leadership we need more
[2:25:52.120 --> 2:26:00.680]  fighters and I'll be voting for governor Ron DeSantis in the upcoming 2022 midterm
[2:26:00.680 --> 2:26:03.800]  election of course he's up for reelection for governor and I look
[2:26:03.800 --> 2:26:09.080]  forward to voting for president Donald Trump in 2024 when Donald Trump runs
[2:26:09.080 --> 2:26:11.400]  for presidents again because we all know that Donald Trump is going to be
[2:26:11.400 --> 2:26:17.920]  running again with 92 days to the midterms the deep state's not going to
[2:26:17.920 --> 2:26:22.720]  go away quietly every poll shows total political realignment women minority
[2:26:22.720 --> 2:26:27.480]  voters all turning to Republicans neocons and rhinos getting kicked out
[2:26:27.480 --> 2:26:32.880]  Liz Cheney you know is going to get annihilated how do you expect him to try
[2:26:32.880 --> 2:26:39.320]  to counter that well of course they're going to use big tech social media
[2:26:39.320 --> 2:26:43.200]  censorship you know I've been warning about that you've been warning about
[2:26:43.200 --> 2:26:48.640]  that here in Florida unfortunately the big tech bill was never successful right
[2:26:48.640 --> 2:26:53.200]  so candidates are still vulnerable to election interference with big tech
[2:26:53.200 --> 2:26:57.000]  myself included I mean we still are the only g-plot formed campaign in the
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:02.440]  entire country the first ever when I first decided to run in 2020 I do
[2:27:02.440 --> 2:27:06.960]  believe that Governor DeSantis made the right decision when he cracked down on
[2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:10.520]  Zuckerberg's making them illegal here in the state of Florida but unfortunately
[2:27:10.520 --> 2:27:14.800]  they haven't been made illegal in other states and so I do suspect and I do
[2:27:14.800 --> 2:27:19.000]  believe that big tech executives are going to use that dark money in
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:23.480]  millions of dollars and funnel them into SOE offices like they did in 2020 to try
[2:27:23.480 --> 2:27:28.480]  to steal the election we need an audit I don't know why there was not an audit
[2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:33.560]  here in the state of Florida after the 2020 election I support a nationwide
[2:27:33.560 --> 2:27:38.800]  audit of the stolen 2020 election because if we don't fix 2020 right all of our
[2:27:38.800 --> 2:27:42.000]  elections and the integrity of our elections going forward are in jeopardy
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:45.960]  but I think that they're also going to use political violence we've seen that
[2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:50.000]  with the recent decision to overturn Roe v Wade and the way that the Democrats
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:54.920]  are inciting their thugs and Black Lives Matter Antifa and radical feminazis
[2:27:54.920 --> 2:27:59.280]  to storm the streets of America and incite political violence I mean these
[2:27:59.280 --> 2:28:02.200]  people are out for blood these people are out for blood and they will stop at
[2:28:02.200 --> 2:28:07.040]  nothing and so we need fighters there's no time for compromise left in the
[2:28:07.040 --> 2:28:11.480]  Republican Party we need to purge all weak rhinos everybody who wants to go
[2:28:11.480 --> 2:28:14.680]  along and get along with these communists in the Democrat Party and
[2:28:14.680 --> 2:28:19.520]  it's time for a new America first Republican Party and America first
[2:28:19.520 --> 2:28:23.040]  hostile takeover of the Republican Party and I'm proud to say the Laura
[2:28:23.040 --> 2:28:25.840]  Loomer for Congress campaign is the face of that movement and we are leading the
[2:28:25.840 --> 2:28:32.360]  charge I totally agree with you Laura Loomer for Congress calm I mean we we
[2:28:32.360 --> 2:28:38.040]  just saw the earlier primaries total sweeps for Trump Patriots the rhinos
[2:28:38.040 --> 2:28:42.000]  are crapping their bridges right now Laura Loomer I want to come back with

[2:33:18.960 --> 2:33:24.080]  I'm not hunter s Thompson I'm not gonzo journalist trying to write myself in
[2:33:24.080 --> 2:33:29.360]  the story but people are asking how am I handling everything is happening I mean
[2:33:29.360 --> 2:33:32.920]  I've seen rig courts I've seen a judge tell a jury I'm already guilty I've seen
[2:33:32.920 --> 2:33:38.320]  them order them to give them money I don't have but I tell you it has been
[2:33:38.320 --> 2:33:45.800]  actually invigorating and and booing in a way bittersweet because I've seen
[2:33:45.800 --> 2:33:52.080]  everybody from Steve Bannon to Charlie Kurt to Jack Pasobak to you name it
[2:33:52.080 --> 2:33:56.960]  thousands of prominent people hundreds of really big folks come out and say hey
[2:33:56.960 --> 2:34:01.160]  this is for all of us they're coming after us all now and I have really seen
[2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:07.720]  the Republican Party go from us with an insurrection not the one on January 6
[2:34:07.720 --> 2:34:12.040]  but the peaceful insurrection to take over the Republican Party five six years
[2:34:12.040 --> 2:34:17.440]  ago to now we are the Republican Party and our populist movement is winning so
[2:34:17.440 --> 2:34:22.320]  yes I'm being punished yes I'm being attacked but I expect that when you're
[2:34:22.320 --> 2:34:27.120]  over the target you're getting the flag people ask me what that means just look
[2:34:27.120 --> 2:34:30.400]  over the definition of when you're over the target you get the flag it's a
[2:34:30.400 --> 2:34:34.520]  world war two analogy because it happened both my grandfathers but the point
[2:34:34.520 --> 2:34:37.400]  is when you're over the target they've got the anti-aircraft gun shooting at
[2:34:37.400 --> 2:34:41.080]  you when you fly over the factory making the pans or tanks and you're gonna drop
[2:34:41.080 --> 2:34:46.560]  10,000 pounds of bombs on them from your b-17 or your liberator they're gonna be
[2:34:46.560 --> 2:34:50.280]  shooting at you so if they're not shooting at you you're not doing your
[2:34:50.280 --> 2:34:55.120]  job and Laura Loomer has been shot at more than any woman out there she's the
[2:34:55.120 --> 2:35:01.520]  type of hardcore patriotic smart woman they fear they blocked her so far but
[2:35:01.520 --> 2:35:06.120]  we got MTG in and when she gets in it's gonna be beautiful but Laura talking
[2:35:06.120 --> 2:35:10.240]  about mindy platforming and now these stage lawsuits and all of it
[2:35:10.240 --> 2:35:16.600]  transcending that the outpouring of support and and now suddenly CPAC like
[2:35:16.600 --> 2:35:23.440]  you said mainline Republicans backing us why do you think they finally get it
[2:35:23.440 --> 2:35:29.640]  well you're much nicer than I am Alex and you know the reality is is I think
[2:35:29.640 --> 2:35:32.800]  these people are just a bunch of bullshit artists and you know what it's too
[2:35:32.800 --> 2:35:35.800]  late it's too late maybe they should have gotten on board with us five years
[2:35:35.800 --> 2:35:39.360]  ago when we were warning them and screaming from the rooftops about this
[2:35:39.360 --> 2:35:43.040]  threat and this war and how you know they didn't stand up for us then they
[2:35:43.040 --> 2:35:46.280]  were gonna come for all of them next they are starting to realize that
[2:35:46.280 --> 2:35:51.320]  everything that we said is true everything that we warned about is 100%
[2:35:51.320 --> 2:35:56.440]  happening and we have been right about absolutely everything Alex and so I am
[2:35:56.440 --> 2:36:00.880]  not going to make excuses for conink I am not gonna make excuses for the
[2:36:00.880 --> 2:36:06.200]  establishment Republican rhino coward no no no I agree with you I'm asking why
[2:36:06.200 --> 2:36:10.800]  are they suddenly doing this because they're scared and they realize that the
[2:36:10.800 --> 2:36:15.200]  crocodile never stops eating and the crocodile is you know eventually going
[2:36:15.200 --> 2:36:18.240]  to eat them too right they have that crocodile is gonna eat you last
[2:36:18.240 --> 2:36:22.560]  mentality and they realize now that oh well maybe I should at least kind of
[2:36:22.560 --> 2:36:26.480]  pretend like I support Alex Jones or maybe I should pretend like I actually
[2:36:26.480 --> 2:36:30.080]  care about free speech so that when it does happen to me maybe somebody will
[2:36:30.080 --> 2:36:33.280]  realize that I posted a pathetic tweet in support of them and they'll come and
[2:36:33.280 --> 2:36:36.720]  help me too I mean it's pathetic it's grandstanding no I agree but but in
[2:36:36.720 --> 2:36:41.600]  fairness I think Trump's a good guy he never thought he'd be censored he gave
[2:36:41.600 --> 2:36:46.160]  lip service but he never took action we forgive him I mean isn't it okay if
[2:36:46.160 --> 2:36:49.560]  Republican establishment wakes up and joins us isn't it a sign of our victory
[2:36:49.560 --> 2:36:57.800]  I get your pissed at him but well look I think that you know Donald Trump you
[2:36:57.800 --> 2:37:02.280]  know he he realized on his way out and as I wrote about in my book I think that
[2:37:02.280 --> 2:37:05.520]  the biggest mistake of his presidency and I supported him I helped get him
[2:37:05.520 --> 2:37:10.160]  elected I still support him and I voted for him twice but I did say when I wrote
[2:37:10.160 --> 2:37:13.880]  in my book Lomert how I became the most banned woman in the world you can order
[2:37:13.880 --> 2:37:17.920]  it online today I did say that the biggest mistake of his presidency was
[2:37:17.920 --> 2:37:21.280]  not taking social media censorship seriously I mean when they had the White
[2:37:21.280 --> 2:37:25.400]  House health social media summit none of us were invited they turned it into one
[2:37:25.400 --> 2:37:30.240]  big giant TP USA rally as opposed to allowing for people who had actually been
[2:37:30.240 --> 2:37:34.760]  banned in D platform to have a voice when I confronted Jack Dorsey during the
[2:37:34.760 --> 2:37:38.520]  congressional hearing I warned I said that Mr. President please help us before
[2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:42.360]  it's too late because they're trying to influence the election I forgot to pull
[2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:45.600]  that up but what's the name of the clip we'll pull it up for the next segment
[2:37:45.600 --> 2:37:50.520]  it's Laura Loomer takes over Congress Laura Loomer warns more censorship in
[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:54.960]  Congress what was the headline something about Laura Loomer confronts Jack Dorsey
[2:37:54.960 --> 2:37:58.760]  during big tech social media censors and you said president help us they're
[2:37:58.760 --> 2:38:01.840]  coming for you next and a year and a half later he was banned off the
[2:38:01.840 --> 2:38:06.560]  internet yeah and I was the first person to ever say I believe live on your show
[2:38:06.560 --> 2:38:11.400]  with you Alex in 2018 that Donald Trump was gonna be banned and people said I
[2:38:11.400 --> 2:38:15.200]  was crazy they said that they would never ban you said it you said it every
[2:38:15.200 --> 2:38:20.320]  time you said they're gonna ban him next yeah and we were right I was right and
[2:38:20.320 --> 2:38:24.920]  the reality is is that look I'm glad that people are waking up now I'm glad
[2:38:24.920 --> 2:38:28.240]  that they're finally realizing it but actions speak louder than words if they
[2:38:28.240 --> 2:38:31.960]  really do believe what they're saying then they should be helping you pay
[2:38:31.960 --> 2:38:36.160]  your legal fees okay you just got hit with 45 million dollars this is
[2:38:36.160 --> 2:38:40.280]  ridiculous this is a witch hunt this is an assault on info wars this is an
[2:38:40.280 --> 2:38:44.400]  attempt to try to take down the greatest news organization in the entire world
[2:38:44.400 --> 2:38:50.000]  I'm talking about info wars calm and if they really truthfully believe what they
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:53.560]  are saying then maybe some of these conink establishment Republicans should
[2:38:53.560 --> 2:38:57.280]  reach into their piggy banks of millions of dollars of donations that they have
[2:38:57.280 --> 2:39:00.880]  received as a result of not having competition in the form of you and
[2:39:00.880 --> 2:39:05.000]  myself and other great content creators over the last few years and maybe they
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:08.360]  should give you some money Alex or are they just gonna post and I should have
[2:39:08.360 --> 2:39:11.240]  done this for you came on because everybody's asking the particulars it's
[2:39:11.240 --> 2:39:16.200]  capped at 5.6 million but they've got two more fake trials so we don't have the
[2:39:16.200 --> 2:39:20.040]  money for that I've got to put up half my wealth which is not much to pay the
[2:39:20.040 --> 2:39:24.360]  bond so we'll continue to fight we run out of money to fight the lawsuits we
[2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:28.040]  run out of money to not fund the bankruptcy then we can be shut down so
[2:39:28.040 --> 2:39:32.280]  we don't need ten million dollars but we do need an extra five million dollars
[2:39:32.280 --> 2:39:35.600]  the next few months people sounds like a lot of money folks not to fight with the
[2:39:35.600 --> 2:39:38.800]  new world order why Laura Loomer mentioned her book why do I mention
[2:39:38.800 --> 2:39:44.680]  stuff we don't have Soros or Bill Gates or the Rockefellers funding us we are
[2:39:44.680 --> 2:39:50.040]  literally we have you so the left makes jokes like why is Roger Stone signing
[2:39:50.040 --> 2:39:54.280]  stones for ten dollars why is he selling books because we got to go out make a
[2:39:54.280 --> 2:39:57.800]  living in this fight folks we have you you have us we don't have the big
[2:39:57.800 --> 2:40:01.680]  backing that's why we're up here constantly bashing our brains out to get
[2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:05.280]  funding because the middle class still hasn't gotten off the bench and
[2:40:05.280 --> 2:40:09.600]  realized we're your champions we don't want to be slaves either we're literally
[2:40:09.600 --> 2:40:14.280]  fighting to the debt for you because we're fighting for ourselves we're in
[2:40:14.280 --> 2:40:17.520]  this together whether you know it or not here's a one-minute clip of you three
[2:40:17.520 --> 2:40:20.160]  years ago warning Trump
[2:40:48.920 --> 2:40:53.880]  that's a great clip there's one with better audio but he says Trump you're
[2:40:53.880 --> 2:40:57.880]  coming for you next we got to stop this now help us we're warning you I mean it
[2:40:57.880 --> 2:41:07.760]  was very prophetic and nobody listened it was a shame so what's your warning now
[2:41:07.760 --> 2:41:14.520]  Laura Loomer well my warning now is 2022 is our last chance to get it right it's
[2:41:14.520 --> 2:41:18.400]  not about just taking back the house in 2022 Alex you know it'd be great to take
[2:41:18.400 --> 2:41:22.520]  back the house but if we have the same feckless cowardly Rhino Republicans who
[2:41:22.520 --> 2:41:25.640]  through President Donald Trump under the bus when we had control of the House in
[2:41:25.640 --> 2:41:29.000]  the Senate when Donald Trump was in the White House nothing is going to change
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:33.600]  these communists and ablers are selling our country out and so as I said
[2:41:33.600 --> 2:41:38.680]  yesterday when I gave a speech it's time for us to elect America for spiders who
[2:41:38.680 --> 2:41:42.320]  are going to get to Washington and flip over these damn tables inside the
[2:41:42.320 --> 2:41:46.880]  United States Capitol because these rhinos and these communists who are
[2:41:46.880 --> 2:41:51.360]  career politicians and have been in Washington for for for nearly 10 years
[2:41:51.360 --> 2:41:55.560]  or had 40-year careers like my rhino opponent Daniel Webster they are
[2:41:55.560 --> 2:42:00.880]  selling out America they don't care about the average American they don't care
[2:42:00.880 --> 2:42:05.360]  about your family all they care about is their bank account and their cushy
[2:42:05.360 --> 2:42:10.280]  little pension and so if we don't get an America first hostile takeover of the
[2:42:10.280 --> 2:42:14.240]  Republican Party nothing is going to matter and I agree we have a globalist
[2:42:14.240 --> 2:42:19.600]  takeover hostile takeover of our energy and our borders and our culture we've
[2:42:19.600 --> 2:42:25.920]  got to start getting hostile as well yes and and look it's not about optics okay
[2:42:25.920 --> 2:42:30.960]  it's not about decorum we are dealing with a godless satanic enemy we are
[2:42:30.960 --> 2:42:34.720]  dealing with communists okay these people don't care about decorum they
[2:42:34.720 --> 2:42:38.120]  don't care about optics and neither should we okay because we're in a war
[2:42:38.120 --> 2:42:41.480]  and you don't play nice when you're in a war you don't send a nice guy to
[2:42:41.480 --> 2:42:44.840]  Washington to fight your war you send a ruthless killer and that's what I am
[2:42:44.840 --> 2:42:48.480]  I'm a ruthless killer I'm a fighter and that's why people should vote for me and
[2:42:48.480 --> 2:42:51.920]  that's why I'm asking for people to show up to the polls storm the polls on
[2:42:51.920 --> 2:42:58.280]  August 23rd in the Republican primary all right sorry Laura Loomer the great
[2:42:58.280 --> 2:43:02.120]  reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want

[2:47:23.360 --> 2:47:27.000]  computer and show it to you doesn't like mainstream media we show you what
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:30.680]  we're talking about if we say the Democrats celebrated raising taxes on
[2:47:30.680 --> 2:47:34.880]  poor people in the middle class and hiring 86,000 IRS agents we show you the
[2:47:34.880 --> 2:47:38.600]  clip if we should you know say that Joe Biden didn't blink for five minutes we
[2:47:38.600 --> 2:47:41.880]  show you the clip if if we say the UN announces you're gonna own nothing and
[2:47:41.880 --> 2:47:46.680]  have nothing we show you the clip wait till you see this coming up in just a
[2:47:46.680 --> 2:47:50.680]  few minutes this shows how upset and angry the world is it's exciting Laura
[2:47:50.680 --> 2:47:56.520]  Loomer I've looked at the news I've seen the polls you're not just saying that you
[2:47:56.520 --> 2:48:02.520]  are set in polls to beat the Republican incumbent in a super red county or
[2:48:02.520 --> 2:48:07.680]  district and to be the new congresswoman coming up in 92 days that is so
[2:48:07.680 --> 2:48:12.320]  ultra-exciting you will be a major beachhead along with MTG and others so
[2:48:12.320 --> 2:48:16.440]  let me say this the left always claims Republican men don't want women I don't
[2:48:16.440 --> 2:48:20.920]  care if you're a woman a man black brown white whatever if you're pro-freedom I
[2:48:20.920 --> 2:48:24.440]  want you in there if we elected a hundred members of Congress that were all
[2:48:24.440 --> 2:48:29.160]  black women I love it as long as they empowered America and there's great
[2:48:29.160 --> 2:48:33.680]  black women to do it but the idea that I give a rat's ass what's between your
[2:48:33.680 --> 2:48:39.120]  legs is a load of horse manure and it scares the Democrats big time that we've
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:44.240]  got women and blacks and Hispanics and Asians at triple the rate of Democrats
[2:48:44.240 --> 2:48:48.600]  now in new elections that's why they're so scared because people really woke it
[2:48:48.600 --> 2:48:56.200]  up absolutely and it really is amazing that the media is freaking out Alex as
[2:48:56.200 --> 2:48:59.120]  you just pointed out we're winning in the polls we're winning in fundraising
[2:48:59.120 --> 2:49:03.000]  and this is a majority red seat so whoever wins the primary will be the
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:06.880]  next member of Congress because there's no chance for a Democrat to get elected
[2:49:06.880 --> 2:49:10.680]  here because there's so many Republicans and I'm running against a guy named
[2:49:10.680 --> 2:49:13.680]  Daniel Webster who skipped the vote on the second impeachment he skipped the
[2:49:13.680 --> 2:49:17.520]  vote on the January 6th Commission and of course that's an abomination because
[2:49:17.520 --> 2:49:21.040]  now we have political prisoners and I am going to be their champion I am going
[2:49:21.040 --> 2:49:25.240]  to fight to release all of those innocent January 6 Patriots and I call
[2:49:25.240 --> 2:49:29.160]  them Patriots because that is exactly what they are they are Patriots who
[2:49:29.160 --> 2:49:33.240]  stood up and fought back against the real insurrection which was the stolen
[2:49:33.240 --> 2:49:37.640]  election of 2020 I am an election integrity candidate I am going to fight
[2:49:37.640 --> 2:49:42.040]  against voter fraud and you know I am going to be big techs worst nightmare
[2:49:42.040 --> 2:49:48.000]  they are going down Alex and I was inspired in 2019 to run for Congress
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:51.640]  because of de-platforming and big tech censorship and I just want to thank you
[2:49:51.640 --> 2:49:55.280]  and Info Wars for you know giving me a platform and believing in me over these
[2:49:55.280 --> 2:49:58.960]  last four years because a lot of people didn't take it seriously and when they
[2:49:58.960 --> 2:50:02.640]  stole my election in 2020 I always said that I was gonna get the last laugh and
[2:50:02.640 --> 2:50:05.920]  I was not going to allow for these communists and the rhinos well you know
[2:50:05.920 --> 2:50:10.920]  why I take you seriously because they take you seriously I mean the enemy smart
[2:50:10.920 --> 2:50:16.120]  they're scared of you haha anybody they're scared of my back well they
[2:50:16.120 --> 2:50:19.800]  should be scared of me Alex because I'm coming for all of them and when I get
[2:50:19.800 --> 2:50:23.600]  there I'm not going to go along and get along I'm going to expose them and it's
[2:50:23.600 --> 2:50:27.880]  gonna be the first time ever that an investigative journalist right a former
[2:50:27.880 --> 2:50:31.800]  project Veritas investigative journalist is elected to the United States
[2:50:31.800 --> 2:50:35.920]  Congress it's so it's gonna be the first time a de-platform censored candidate
[2:50:35.920 --> 2:50:39.480]  is elected to the United States Congress it's gonna be the first time ever a
[2:50:39.480 --> 2:50:44.240]  red flagged individual on an FBI watch list is elected to the United States
[2:50:44.240 --> 2:50:47.600]  Congress I know what it's like to be silenced I know what it's like to have
[2:50:47.600 --> 2:50:51.720]  my rights violated by a corrupt tyrannical federal government and I am
[2:50:51.720 --> 2:50:56.040]  going to be every American's voice and so I ask for their support and I'm
[2:50:56.040 --> 2:50:59.240]  grateful to have your support and if people want to donate to my campaign
[2:50:59.240 --> 2:51:03.320]  they can donate at Laura Loomer for Congress comm and we're gonna win and I
[2:51:03.320 --> 2:51:06.760]  hope that Info Wars will come out to Florida on August 23rd and do the
[2:51:06.760 --> 2:51:11.040]  exclusive live broadcast of my victory party I want to we are just absolutely
[2:51:11.040 --> 2:51:14.880]  embattled and at war but it there's a good chance we will Laura let me just
[2:51:14.880 --> 2:51:19.480]  bring up this big announcement ladies and gentlemen if millions of people get
[2:51:19.480 --> 2:51:23.440]  this book our funding problems will be over and it's starting to happen that's

[2:52:09.720 --> 2:52:14.280]  want to thank everybody else like Michael Malis and others that have been
[2:52:14.280 --> 2:52:19.320]  boasting it this is major this is political this could fund our war

[2:52:36.600 --> 2:52:41.640]  Alex and you're a superstar and you have led so many people to the truth and to
[2:52:41.640 --> 2:52:45.480]  light and you have woken up so many people and I hope that your book goes
[2:52:45.480 --> 2:52:49.600]  to number one and I can't wait till I get elected to Congress and you can come
[2:52:49.600 --> 2:52:54.000]  up there and testify in Congress when I'm you know chairing one of those
[2:52:54.000 --> 2:52:57.720]  committees and one of those hearings on big tech social media censorship and
[2:52:57.720 --> 2:53:01.440]  then the entire country is going to hear your story Alex and I have been
[2:53:01.440 --> 2:53:05.160]  looking forward to that day for a long time and I just can't wait. I can't wait
[2:53:05.160 --> 2:53:08.080]  either MTG is invited to Congress he's trying to get some hearings going for
[2:53:08.080 --> 2:53:11.560]  us I know she probably wants to have you speak out and we've talked about it but
[2:53:11.560 --> 2:53:16.000]  man why do you think it's so many like Kerry Lake and others why is it so many
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:21.000]  bad-ass women starting to win with which is great but why do you think so many
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:23.960]  men other than DeSantis are on the sidelines what's what's going on with
[2:53:23.960 --> 2:53:28.640]  the women that's really exciting by the way well it's great and you know I don't
[2:53:28.640 --> 2:53:32.680]  really ever use my my gender no I don't either but let's just say it
[2:53:32.680 --> 2:53:37.760]  Republicans are surging with women what's going on well I think that's a
[2:53:37.760 --> 2:53:42.460]  lot of women are starting to realize that this globalist communist godless new
[2:53:42.460 --> 2:53:47.480]  world order is is a threat and a danger to their children and their families
[2:53:47.480 --> 2:53:51.160]  and they're starting to wake up and they're starting to see that right-wing
[2:53:51.160 --> 2:53:56.640]  etiologies are are better not just for their families but for our country but
[2:53:56.640 --> 2:53:59.880]  you know you speak of all these other people who are America first you know
[2:53:59.880 --> 2:54:03.680]  it sure it would be great if they would actually fight back against the
[2:54:03.680 --> 2:54:07.240]  censorship of my campaign because I don't really feel the love Alex I mean
[2:54:07.240 --> 2:54:11.120]  I'm grateful to you but I don't really see a lot of these other people you know
[2:54:11.120 --> 2:54:15.520]  platforming my campaign it doesn't feel great to be blacklisted on the war you
[2:54:15.520 --> 2:54:19.240]  know what even people that are patriots say well if I help Loomer or Jones I
[2:54:19.240 --> 2:54:22.800]  might get censored we're all gonna get censored it's Benjamin Franklin said
[2:54:22.800 --> 2:54:27.840]  hang together or hang separate right and if these people truly do believe the
[2:54:27.840 --> 2:54:30.720]  election was stolen and they want America first buyers and they want to
[2:54:30.720 --> 2:54:34.240]  fight back against censorship and they should find the courage within themselves
[2:54:34.240 --> 2:54:38.800]  to stop blacklisting my campaign and to actually platform me because the egg is
[2:54:38.800 --> 2:54:42.720]  going to be on their face on election day when I win Alex and I'm just no
[2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:46.240]  longer gonna stay silent I'm calling all of these people out I'm calling people
[2:54:46.240 --> 2:54:51.120]  out for being frauds for being grifters for being silent two years ago I said
[2:54:51.120 --> 2:54:54.160]  Laura I've looked at your race and talked to experts and they say it's an
[2:54:54.160 --> 2:54:56.440]  uphill battle but you're gonna build credibility you're gonna build a
[2:54:56.440 --> 2:55:00.320]  campaign operation you're like no I'm gonna win I said well you're gonna win
[2:55:00.320 --> 2:55:04.840]  down the road find a better district and you've done that and the numbers say
[2:55:04.840 --> 2:55:09.000]  you're gonna win are you worried about election fraud I mean I guess we got to
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:16.440]  have such a surge such a huge wave a red wave that overrides their fraud well
[2:55:16.440 --> 2:55:20.200]  they already are committing fraud by the platforming my campaign that is a form of
[2:55:20.200 --> 2:55:24.440]  illegal election big tech interference that of course the Republican Party has
[2:55:24.440 --> 2:55:29.320]  sanctioned by staying silent on the interference of my campaign but we are
[2:55:29.320 --> 2:55:33.160]  going to have an army of poll watchers and we are working hard to make sure
[2:55:33.160 --> 2:55:38.440]  that people are voting in a secure fashion luckily there are so many voter
[2:55:38.440 --> 2:55:42.960]  integrity election integrity groups on the grassroots level in my district and
[2:55:42.960 --> 2:55:47.160]  they are encouraging people to vote at the polls on election day and we are
[2:55:47.160 --> 2:55:51.240]  also Trump has said nice things about you in the past is he backing you what
[2:55:51.240 --> 2:55:55.720]  about Trump coming for a rally for you well Trump endorsed me and voted for me
[2:55:55.720 --> 2:55:58.920]  down in 2020 when I ran in Palm Beach County and I'm hoping to earn the
[2:55:58.920 --> 2:56:02.760]  president's endorsement this time around Donald Trump said that he wants to get
[2:56:02.760 --> 2:56:06.680]  rid of all the rhino sellouts and losers and I am running against a rhino sellout
[2:56:06.680 --> 2:56:11.000]  loser who was so much of a coward that he didn't stand up and fight for president
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:13.960]  Trump during the second impeachment he skipped the vote he does not believe
[2:56:13.960 --> 2:56:17.240]  you're being friendly towards Trump but I sometimes bitching at Trump gets his
[2:56:17.240 --> 2:56:21.400]  attention I was told that I took a Carl San Roger stone and quit kissing his ass
[2:56:21.400 --> 2:56:24.520]  and if you get in Trump's face you get stuff we need to get in Trump's face in
[2:56:24.520 --> 2:56:28.440]  a friendly way and say back Laura Loomer right now well that's what I'm trying to
[2:56:28.440 --> 2:56:32.280]  say right now is that president Donald Trump said primary the rhinos and the
[2:56:32.280 --> 2:56:35.640]  sellouts and the losers and so if he does believe what he says then it's time
[2:56:35.640 --> 2:56:39.240]  for him to endorse me and I'm asking for president Donald Trump's endorsement and
[2:56:39.240 --> 2:56:42.600]  I'm a Trump supporter but you know what does he want does he want another rhino
[2:56:42.600 --> 2:56:45.640]  does he want a bunch of loser rhino sellouts who don't believe the election
[2:56:45.640 --> 2:56:50.120]  was stolen if he runs again in 2024 or does he want a fighter and so I hope
[2:56:50.120 --> 2:56:53.640]  that he will stop listening to people like Kevin McCarthy who are probably
[2:56:53.640 --> 2:56:57.400]  saying terrible things to him about me I hope that president Trump doesn't listen
[2:56:57.400 --> 2:57:02.920]  to rhino establishment frauds like Rana Romney and Kevin McCarthy and that he
[2:57:02.920 --> 2:57:08.200]  will realize that I am the fighter that he needs in Washington DC I am the
[2:57:08.200 --> 2:57:12.280]  America first fighter needed to represent the most
[2:57:12.280 --> 2:57:16.840]  MAGA deep red republicans seat in central Florida and that is district 11
[2:57:16.840 --> 2:57:21.240]  and it would be honored Laura Loomer for congress.com Laura you're amazing
[2:57:21.240 --> 2:57:25.160]  and I can't wait to see your victory party thank you so much

[2:57:40.920 --> 2:57:46.360]  the great trans forecaster Gerald Salete
[2:57:48.200 --> 2:57:51.880]  the great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government
[2:57:51.880 --> 2:57:56.280]  doesn't want you to read that most of the big powerful companies trying to
[2:57:56.280 --> 2:58:00.120]  control your life the big tech companies they don't want you to read
[2:58:00.120 --> 2:58:02.840]  this book they want to control what you think
[2:58:02.840 --> 2:58:07.160]  what you do what you read but you don't want that and Alex Jones doesn't want
[2:58:07.160 --> 2:58:09.720]  that and this book shows you what's happening
[2:58:09.720 --> 2:58:14.280]  and gives you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it and so by buying
[2:58:14.280 --> 2:58:18.440]  this book you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work that freedom is
[2:58:18.440 --> 2:58:21.800]  alive in this country this is a central reading
[2:58:21.800 --> 2:58:26.520]  and you know I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in
[2:58:26.520 --> 2:58:30.200]  it's not going to be available in bookstores it's not going to be available
[2:58:30.200 --> 2:58:33.960]  in libraries they're going to try to take it down from every platform that
[2:58:33.960 --> 2:58:36.280]  they can but they're not going to be able to do it
[2:58:36.280 --> 2:58:39.560]  prove that censorship doesn't work by the great reset
[2:58:39.560 --> 2:58:42.600]  thank you Alex Jones I really appreciate you having me on and I

[3:00:21.480 --> 3:00:25.480]  good this is Greg i spoke to you a couple times i'm the laser tech guy
[3:00:25.480 --> 3:00:32.520]  yes sir hey anyways uh two things uh i have uh i want to promote one of your
[3:00:32.520 --> 3:00:36.520]  products real quick uh then i want to get on to what i
[3:00:36.520 --> 3:00:42.360]  called about uh first your x2 uh there was a doctor his name is dr gerry
[3:00:42.360 --> 3:00:47.960]  tenant uh he won up i think it was a Pulitzer prize about a year ago
[3:00:47.960 --> 3:00:54.600]  on frequency technology and he said about nascent iodine
[3:00:54.600 --> 3:01:00.840]  that is the only thing that will take you know people all over the world over
[3:01:00.840 --> 3:01:05.160]  the last 18 years have toxicity in their bodies from
[3:01:05.160 --> 3:01:10.280]  all the plastics we consume uh this creates a cell phone
[3:01:10.280 --> 3:01:14.600]  cellophane over all cells so they cannot breathe properly
[3:01:14.600 --> 3:01:19.000]  and excrete properly uh he said in this report
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:23.480]  nascent iodine is the only thing the only thing that will
[3:01:23.480 --> 3:01:28.680]  uh rid the plastic from your cells so there you go there's a plug for you on
[3:01:28.680 --> 3:01:31.320]  that well there's no doubt that that true
[3:01:31.320 --> 3:01:35.000]  atomic iodine that your body can absorb is incredible most iodine is bound
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:38.840]  that's why x2 we got from the oil drilling companies
[3:01:38.840 --> 3:01:42.040]  and it's medical grade you have to have a dea license to even get it
[3:01:42.040 --> 3:01:45.800]  then it's put into the palm oil and it's no longer uh you know dea because it's
[3:01:45.800 --> 3:01:49.400]  not pure anymore but the iodine's pure it goes right to the cells
[3:01:49.400 --> 3:01:53.480]  x2 is the true game changer everyone should be taking it in fact
[3:01:53.480 --> 3:01:56.680]  callers were calling in about it today i was like i haven't taken x2 in like two
[3:01:56.680 --> 3:01:59.560]  weeks my bottle ran out i've got to go get another bottle so
[3:01:59.560 --> 3:02:03.880]  everybody should get x2 it takes about two weeks on average to kick in
[3:02:03.880 --> 3:02:07.160]  usually after two weeks you kind of feel a little bit toxic for a couple days
[3:02:07.160 --> 3:02:11.960]  then you feel great it's amazing get x2 at infowarstore.com
[3:02:11.960 --> 3:02:17.480]  experience it x2 at infowarstore.com uh Greg what was your other point
[3:02:17.480 --> 3:02:21.960]  okay the other thing is this Alex uh no one has been talking about you know
[3:02:21.960 --> 3:02:24.440]  you're seeing banks around the world over the last
[3:02:24.440 --> 3:02:27.160]  several years in greece different parts of europe
[3:02:27.160 --> 3:02:31.160]  now you're seeing them in china the tanks outside some of the large banks
[3:02:31.160 --> 3:02:37.960]  okay uh no one's talking about chase bank and jamie diamonds
[3:02:37.960 --> 3:02:43.320]  uh connection with the devos group uh no one's talking about that and i
[3:02:43.320 --> 3:02:47.480]  you know i always i'm up on a lot of stuff as you know
[3:02:47.480 --> 3:02:53.640]  and i i feel that uh if if the stuff really does end up hitting a fan
[3:02:53.640 --> 3:02:58.120]  that chase bank and they're the biggest uh is gonna fold
[3:02:58.120 --> 3:03:01.560]  and that's right goldman's backs and chase are the most heavily invested in
[3:03:01.560 --> 3:03:05.080]  china that's right and the other thing is this
[3:03:05.080 --> 3:03:09.080]  you know look what soros did in britain you know in the late 60s very early
[3:03:09.080 --> 3:03:14.040]  70s he almost crashed the pound yep and you know when i went over there i used
[3:03:14.040 --> 3:03:18.520]  to play you know on the pro pro tennis store when i was over there in the 80s
[3:03:18.520 --> 3:03:21.640]  i was seeing in the in the little supermarkets
[3:03:21.640 --> 3:03:26.040]  uh people in their 70s bagging groceries
[3:03:26.040 --> 3:03:29.400]  and you know i just thought boy that's nice you know give some old people
[3:03:29.400 --> 3:03:33.080]  something to do for the day or whatever and then as i got to uh
[3:03:33.080 --> 3:03:36.440]  you know talk to some people and some of the pubs in that
[3:03:36.440 --> 3:03:40.760]  they you know they lost all their pensions they lost everything and they
[3:03:40.760 --> 3:03:44.840]  hit a work and that was you know that's pretty sad
[3:03:44.840 --> 3:03:48.440]  you know that that's uh that's what happened so soros has crashed more than
[3:03:48.440 --> 3:03:52.360]  20 pension funds worldwide it's especially for the left

[3:06:13.960 --> 3:06:17.640]  alex thanks for taking my call three quick bullet points we spoke about a
[3:06:17.640 --> 3:06:21.160]  month ago i had relocated to pennsypola from michigan
[3:06:21.160 --> 3:06:24.760]  and i indicated to you i had a business trip and i had a major
[3:06:24.760 --> 3:06:28.600]  sinus issue and iraq and two days later the x2 cleared it up
[3:06:28.600 --> 3:06:33.320]  and your staff made a hilarious video where gretchen wittner with the swastika
[3:06:33.320 --> 3:06:37.880]  on her face and i'm talking to my i'm talking to my daughter
[3:06:37.880 --> 3:06:41.240]  who used to have a podcast and i heard out of fort lauderdale and she's
[3:06:41.240 --> 3:06:45.480]  really into the media she follows you um and she says dad you record it and i was
[3:06:45.480 --> 3:06:49.720]  like i didn't even think of that so i called jon back i said john i had an
[3:06:49.720 --> 3:06:53.800]  idea and i'd like a copy of the commercial and i'd
[3:06:53.800 --> 3:06:58.360]  like a copy of the audio and i'll donate 50 bucks on each one
[3:06:58.360 --> 3:07:02.680]  i said why don't you guys take free money off the table
[3:07:02.680 --> 3:07:05.880]  and when everybody calls in and the screen call you say would you like a
[3:07:05.880 --> 3:07:10.040]  recording of the phone call with alex they give a $50 donation
[3:07:10.040 --> 3:07:14.040]  you take their credit info you can throw a link up on the website at the end of
[3:07:14.040 --> 3:07:17.480]  the call the next day or whatever they can download the phone call
[3:07:17.480 --> 3:07:21.560]  you could generate a lot of money 50 bucks a call just to have someone record
[3:07:21.560 --> 3:07:25.240]  and first could share it absolutely it's got to put the infrastructure in
[3:07:25.240 --> 3:07:28.280]  but it's a fabulous idea i didn't see the promo you mentioned because i'll be
[3:07:28.280 --> 3:07:33.640]  honest i'm really sick alex jones so when i walk through the halls the shows on
[3:07:33.640 --> 3:07:37.400]  i stick my fingers in my ears not that i'm bad but let's just say this i've
[3:07:37.400 --> 3:07:41.400]  had a little too much of myself so i have not seen that ad i'm sorry
[3:07:41.400 --> 3:07:45.640]  it was hilarious gretz whitmer with the swastika and then you showed the beaches
[3:07:45.640 --> 3:07:48.520]  of florida and then you showed the smokestacks from
[3:07:48.520 --> 3:07:51.880]  detroit i mean i couldn't stop laughing but i want to point out one more thing
[3:07:51.880 --> 3:07:54.440]  there's a guy in canada you got to get a hold of
[3:07:54.440 --> 3:08:00.760]  he is a christian he is in my view the the alex jones of the christian world
[3:08:00.760 --> 3:08:05.800]  his name is rick pierce and he has a show out of toronto called prophecy u s a
[3:08:05.800 --> 3:08:09.800]  and he ties into the scriptures about what the united states is going to rick
[3:08:09.800 --> 3:08:13.240]  pierce it i've heard his name multiple times guys let's get rick pierce it on
[3:08:13.240 --> 3:08:16.360]  thank you so much brother i can talk to these callers all day but i got the next
[3:08:16.360 --> 3:08:20.360]  person uh jd in indiana jd go ahead
[3:08:20.360 --> 3:08:24.600]  yeah i'm actually calling i want to tie in um the censorship
[3:08:24.600 --> 3:08:28.200]  that i'm finding everywhere in with the fact that they let
[3:08:28.200 --> 3:08:34.920]  uh they let child porn be sent right so when i i feel like we have to infiltrate
[3:08:34.920 --> 3:08:39.000]  their sandbox right so i'm on twitter i'm all on these things i'm sharing
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:44.200]  information hold on your on twitter live time they will ban
[3:08:44.200 --> 3:08:48.760]  your video right but yet they can you can send child porn to people but they
[3:08:48.760 --> 3:08:52.600]  don't ban that that's right they're pre-programming videos of me
[3:08:52.600 --> 3:08:55.480]  that ai looks at and won't let people put out
[3:08:55.480 --> 3:08:59.160]  but child porn can still be sent incredibly good point
[3:08:59.160 --> 3:09:02.440]  exactly and it's absolutely terrible and this is the reason why i agree with
[3:09:02.440 --> 3:09:05.560]  laura lumar we have got to do something about these
[3:09:05.560 --> 3:09:09.320]  companies if we have the technology to openly
[3:09:09.320 --> 3:09:12.760]  censor a man who's just talking about a case
[3:09:12.760 --> 3:09:16.680]  in all reality i mean at the end of the day a fair trial is a fair trial you're
[3:09:16.680 --> 3:09:19.720]  not getting one and you're talking about it
[3:09:19.720 --> 3:09:22.920]  but yet you can send the video of child porn
[3:09:22.920 --> 3:09:26.360]  it's absolutely insanity and it's ridiculous
[3:09:26.360 --> 3:09:29.240]  and we ought to hold these people accountable because they're aiding and
[3:09:29.240 --> 3:09:32.760]  abetting in people that are that are terrorizing
[3:09:32.760 --> 3:09:36.040]  children and hurting our children and let me describe pernude lizards is just
[3:09:36.040 --> 3:09:38.920]  to name what jd's saying they came out with it 10 years ago
[3:09:38.920 --> 3:09:42.760]  one program is called shazam you can hold up your iphone at the mall or the
[3:09:42.760 --> 3:09:46.600]  grocery store or wherever and you could you could
[3:09:46.600 --> 3:09:49.000]  record a few seconds it would tell you what song it was
[3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:52.840]  they have similar technology for videos audio and text that's how they block
[3:09:52.840 --> 3:09:55.640]  info wars from getting uploaded on the web everywhere
[3:09:55.640 --> 3:09:59.800]  before it even gets published but they can't stop child porn
[3:09:59.800 --> 3:10:03.080]  they exactly that because they're doing it on purpose god bless you
[3:10:03.080 --> 3:10:07.400]  i appreciate your call jd now let's talk to mark in massachusetts mark thanks for
[3:10:07.400 --> 3:10:11.640]  holding hey alex long time listener first time

[3:10:17.240 --> 3:10:21.400]  know about like phil schneider if you've ever heard of him before
[3:10:21.400 --> 3:10:25.000]  which phil schneider there's a lot of phil schneiders he was like a whistle
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:29.800]  blower back on the underground basis yeah i interviewed him one month
[3:10:29.800 --> 3:10:33.000]  before he died like 25 years ago was incredible
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:37.480]  no kidding because i was also watching the show called
[3:10:37.480 --> 3:10:42.200]  cosmic disclosure and they're saying they're doing crazy stuff
[3:10:42.200 --> 3:10:46.680]  down on those underground bunkers with like human slicing with aliens and
[3:10:46.680 --> 3:10:50.680]  hybrids and everything do you know anything about that
[3:10:50.680 --> 3:10:53.800]  i don't know that's true but there's a lot of stuff going on underground
[3:10:53.800 --> 3:10:56.920]  and they admit they're splicing animals with humans openly
[3:10:56.920 --> 3:11:01.480]  with chimeric clones so that's mainline news
[3:11:01.480 --> 3:11:06.200]  one of the other whistleblowers on this cosmic disclosure on gaya
[3:11:06.200 --> 3:11:10.360]  tv whatever um said that they actually have whole
[3:11:10.360 --> 3:11:15.240]  cities of clones of people that they're actually releasing viruses and seeing
[3:11:15.240 --> 3:11:19.720]  how quick people can die from different viruses

[3:12:00.760 --> 3:12:04.440]  elements nutrients it's not some compound that releases nitrous oxide in the
[3:12:04.440 --> 3:12:09.000]  blood that's what it really does yeah yeah um and it tastes great with a

[3:12:35.320 --> 3:12:40.040]  i'm in california holding the line spiritually i do a lot of meditation i
[3:12:40.040 --> 3:12:43.720]  do a lot of prayer um i'm trying to work against this great
[3:12:43.720 --> 3:12:47.720]  force of darkness that we're singing to uh throughout the whole world
[3:12:47.720 --> 3:12:51.960]  and i'm doing my best every day and i love you i love listening to you
[3:12:51.960 --> 3:12:55.560]  number two you're saying you're getting sick of alex jones
[3:12:55.560 --> 3:12:58.840]  i invite you to come back to your route alex
[3:12:58.840 --> 3:13:02.440]  go back to the history books read some passages maybe
[3:13:02.440 --> 3:13:06.600]  two segments a day the successful revolution where the people rose up
[3:13:06.600 --> 3:13:10.440]  where the people came together my ancestors the greeks were enslaved by
[3:13:10.440 --> 3:13:14.280]  the church for 500 years how did we keep our culture
[3:13:14.280 --> 3:13:18.840]  how did we keep our people alive how did we survive to this day
[3:13:18.840 --> 3:13:22.360]  now you're right the greek surviving 500 years of occupation is
[3:13:22.360 --> 3:13:26.840]  probably the greatest resistance story exactly and there's stories like that
[3:13:26.840 --> 3:13:30.760]  all over the world in asia in europe in africa
[3:13:30.760 --> 3:13:35.400]  even in america especially uh more closer to modern day
[3:13:35.400 --> 3:13:40.680]  beautifully said dean call me again i got shon and tyson i can give you each
[3:13:40.680 --> 3:13:43.320]  a minute not trying to cut your short when i get to both of you shon you're on
[3:13:43.320 --> 3:13:47.880]  the air go ahead hi alex thank you for taking my call
[3:13:47.880 --> 3:13:51.160]  um two things i wanted to talk about is the county sheriff
[3:13:51.160 --> 3:13:54.760]  and then the judge presiding over your case uh first
[3:13:54.760 --> 3:13:58.280]  most people do not realize that the sheriff the county sheriff is the
[3:13:58.280 --> 3:14:01.720]  highest ranking law enforcement officer in the county
[3:14:01.720 --> 3:14:05.080]  he took an oath to uphold and defend the constitution
[3:14:05.080 --> 3:14:09.480]  the judge also took an oath to uphold and defend the constitution
[3:14:09.480 --> 3:14:14.360]  she violated that oath when she violated your constitutional right
[3:14:14.360 --> 3:14:19.000]  i don't know what county your trial was in promise but the county sheriff has a
[3:14:19.000 --> 3:14:23.880]  responsibility to arrest her for violating her oath
[3:14:23.880 --> 3:14:27.720]  well there's no doubt she's a monster i mean a full-on soros monster
[3:14:27.720 --> 3:14:31.000]  who told the jury i was guilty 20-something times but judge did that
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:35.240]  once it's a mistrial every time they just decided to do this criminal
[3:14:35.240 --> 3:14:39.480]  operation it's just really important that people
[3:14:39.480 --> 3:14:42.840]  understand the importance of the county sheriff in their county
[3:14:42.840 --> 3:14:46.600]  they need to ask their sheriff are you a constitutional sheriff if the sheriff
[3:14:46.600 --> 3:14:49.880]  can't answer that or they hesitate that gives them their answer
[3:14:49.880 --> 3:14:54.840]  i hear shon thank you so much tyson and kansas last caller
[3:14:54.840 --> 3:14:59.400]  uh hey alex um just real quick i wanted to tie in what happened with you uh
[3:14:59.400 --> 3:15:04.360]  first of all it's a tragedy um that this would happen uh
[3:15:04.360 --> 3:15:09.320]  to an american but uh i think it's like the i know you talked a lot about like
[3:15:09.320 --> 3:15:15.160]  the blueprint being laid out i think it really is just a show or um
[3:15:15.160 --> 3:15:19.560]  like sort of a designated dose of what they're going to give
[3:15:19.560 --> 3:15:25.240]  to the american people coming up um if you speak out against certain things
[3:15:25.240 --> 3:15:31.240]  you're going to be held um accountable or liable i guess as the legal jargon that
[3:15:31.240 --> 3:15:35.880]  they would probably use um you're going to have to pay fees and if you can't pay
[3:15:35.880 --> 3:15:39.320]  up they'll probably throw your ass in jail or oh it's already happening in
[3:15:39.320 --> 3:15:42.040]  england in europe you're absolutely yes this is the
[3:15:42.040 --> 3:15:45.800]  month they admitted in the closing we're gonna shut down all the conservatives
[3:15:45.800 --> 3:15:48.680]  it's incredible thank you for holding tyson we love you and appreciate you

[3:33:46.040 --> 3:33:51.560]  communism equals censorship communism equals dictates

[3:33:55.560 --> 3:34:02.680]  god-given rights of life liberty in the pursuit of happiness

[3:34:06.920 --> 3:34:11.320]  with uh we're just going down here you know i watched this
[3:34:11.320 --> 3:34:17.080]  interview with roger waters and on cnn what a little jerk they had
[3:34:17.080 --> 3:34:22.920]  interviewing him pink floyd cat what a little more on this guy was
[3:34:22.920 --> 3:34:28.840]  these stupid comments he's making when when you know one one
[3:34:28.840 --> 3:34:32.280]  dopey thing after another and you know people say you know
[3:34:32.280 --> 3:34:39.320]  solente you're very angry but i am i'm angry i'm a man
[3:34:39.320 --> 3:34:43.000]  and i see where life is going and i'm a trend forecast i've been at this for
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:47.160]  42 years that's selling books trends 2000
[3:34:47.160 --> 3:34:50.600]  trend tracking father of the megatrends time magazine
[3:34:50.600 --> 3:34:54.200]  publisher the trends journal weekly magazine
[3:34:54.200 --> 3:35:01.320]  last week was only about 158 pages i read about the facts i understand
[3:35:01.320 --> 3:35:04.760]  where we are how we got here so i can see where we're going
[3:35:04.760 --> 3:35:10.440]  and i see hell on earth so that's why i'm fighting and doing what i can
[3:35:10.440 --> 3:35:16.600]  to restore what we've lost and we can do it we need a second american revolution
[3:35:16.600 --> 3:35:22.680]  and this one has to be peaceful it can be because we're fighting no bodies
[3:35:22.680 --> 3:35:28.360]  and being angry he was not angry when there is just cause for anger is immoral
[3:35:28.360 --> 3:35:32.440]  why because anger looks to the good of justice
[3:35:32.440 --> 3:35:35.960]  and if you can live amid injustice without anger
[3:35:35.960 --> 3:35:41.240]  you are immoral as well as unjust said saint thomas
[3:35:41.240 --> 3:35:47.000]  aquinas leave or not to believe in anybody you want to believe in but the
[3:35:47.000 --> 3:35:51.880]  quote makes sense to me it's a freak show and the freaks
[3:35:51.880 --> 3:35:57.560]  are in charge look at fauci last week
[3:35:57.560 --> 3:36:01.000]  if you are in up to date on covid vaccines and boosters you're going to
[3:36:01.000 --> 3:36:06.520]  get into trouble that's right if they don't get
[3:36:06.520 --> 3:36:10.920]  vaccinated they don't get boosted they're going to get into trouble
[3:36:10.920 --> 3:36:16.200]  fauci's white president biden's chief medical advisor
[3:36:16.200 --> 3:36:22.520]  chief pieces scum crap the guy that sold his aides
[3:36:22.520 --> 3:36:26.680]  the guy that jfk jr wrote about in his book
[3:36:26.680 --> 3:36:31.720]  and you read jfk jr's book and you see the facts
[3:36:31.720 --> 3:36:38.920]  or what a disgusting piece of slime the highest paid public servant in america
[3:36:38.920 --> 3:36:44.280]  fauci is spewing out don't get angry so let's eat
[3:36:44.280 --> 3:36:50.200]  we hate you we love fauci we like to swallow crap
[3:36:50.200 --> 3:36:55.880]  we eat crap we listen to crap we swallow crap
[3:36:55.880 --> 3:37:02.440]  we are the demo craps no no no we're the repulsive givings
[3:37:02.440 --> 3:37:06.760]  here it is he was not angry
[3:37:06.760 --> 3:37:11.000]  yep just cause why because anger looks to the good of
[3:37:11.000 --> 3:37:14.760]  justice and if you can live amid injustice without anger
[3:37:14.760 --> 3:37:20.760]  you are immoral as well as unjust
[3:37:21.400 --> 3:37:25.000]  and again when you look at info wars and then you look at what the people
[3:37:25.000 --> 3:37:29.640]  think of the rest of the media american confidence in two facets of the news
[3:37:29.640 --> 3:37:34.440]  media newspapers and television news has fallen to all-time low points to 16
[3:37:34.440 --> 3:37:38.440]  percent of u.s adults now say they have a great deal with quite
[3:37:38.440 --> 3:37:42.040]  a lot of confidence in newspapers and only 11 percent
[3:37:42.040 --> 3:37:49.000]  in television news yep television news again you look at that
[3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:53.160]  that interview with waters and that little clown
[3:37:53.160 --> 3:37:57.800]  moron imbecile gutless little coward interviewing him
[3:37:57.800 --> 3:38:02.280]  again i used to be on cn my four times a month back in a day
[3:38:02.280 --> 3:38:06.200]  i used to be on the today's show good morning america
[3:38:06.200 --> 3:38:13.640]  opera you name it i was on i've been on the other side

[3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:02.840]  graham criticized senator ran paul this goes back
[3:40:02.840 --> 3:40:08.520]  after paul said quote i've heard of many tragic cases
[3:40:08.520 --> 3:40:13.320]  of walking talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders
[3:40:13.320 --> 3:40:19.480]  after vaccines response graham said that paul was quote
[3:40:19.480 --> 3:40:25.480]  creating anxiety for no good reason and looking at this issue through
[3:40:25.480 --> 3:40:30.680]  libertarian's eyes not a physician's eyes
[3:40:30.680 --> 3:40:35.800]  latest little jerk of a moron this arrogant arrogant arrogant arrogant

[3:40:53.240 --> 3:41:02.520]  fat mouth slime ball warmongering lowlife piece of garbage graham said
[3:41:02.520 --> 3:41:07.640]  as for freedom it is cherished it's hard to come by
[3:41:07.640 --> 3:41:11.240]  it is hard to hang on to yeah you know why
[3:41:11.240 --> 3:41:17.960]  because slimmers like you are stealing it from us
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:26.680]  but freedom without responsibility is chaos so to those who push the idea that
[3:41:26.680 --> 3:41:31.720]  freedom would allow an individual to do anything
[3:41:31.720 --> 3:41:38.680]  anywhere at any time i reject hi graham the little clown
[3:41:38.680 --> 3:41:45.400]  i reject your freedom ends where my ability
[3:41:45.400 --> 3:41:52.520]  to raise my family safely begins so i would urge every american to vaccinate
[3:41:52.520 --> 3:41:57.080]  their children oh yeah vaccinate your children

[3:42:15.400 --> 3:42:21.080]  which looks like you have got a pretty fat gut yourself
[3:42:21.080 --> 3:42:26.920]  oh yeah and out of 74 million people have a course of two years one to 17 year
[3:42:26.920 --> 3:42:35.800]  olds about 72 74 million less than 700 died what are you talking about

[3:42:41.240 --> 3:42:45.640]  graham side right out of that freak faces mouth
[3:42:45.640 --> 3:42:49.880]  and fascism on the other side he loves war to support the military industrial

[3:50:01.080 --> 3:50:04.840]  that people with severe gum disease would not
[3:50:04.840 --> 3:50:08.120]  were nine times more likely to get covid
[3:50:08.120 --> 3:50:12.760]  yeah no kidding yeah your immune system is breaking down
[3:50:12.760 --> 3:50:16.200]  you know i saw an info wars they they the mayor

[3:50:22.920 --> 3:50:26.680]  you know we've been writing about this in the trends journal for for years
[3:50:26.680 --> 3:50:30.760]  how costly it is to america and and to the people
[3:50:30.760 --> 3:50:35.640]  again the people swallow crap they swallow crap food they listen to crap
[3:50:35.640 --> 3:50:39.400]  news and and they obey crap heads that they
[3:50:39.400 --> 3:50:43.240]  call politicians again if i was elected i'd have
[3:50:43.240 --> 3:50:46.520]  a fat tax the more you pay the more your way
[3:50:46.520 --> 3:50:49.640]  you know the better you get the less you pay
[3:50:49.640 --> 3:50:53.480]  i mean this is terrible what's going on little children
[3:50:53.480 --> 3:50:57.080]  and now they got everybody freaked out you know where i am up here
[3:50:57.080 --> 3:51:00.840]  in in new york i don't like it here anymore i love kingston
[3:51:00.840 --> 3:51:04.280]  i don't dig it here anymore people are so uptight and when shopping the other
[3:51:04.280 --> 3:51:08.280]  day people with masks on all over the place
[3:51:08.280 --> 3:51:11.960]  walking outside with masks on driving in their cars
[3:51:11.960 --> 3:51:17.320]  with masks on you used to have a farmers market across the street over here
[3:51:17.320 --> 3:51:19.960]  they still do they used to have it out in the street which is much better if they
[3:51:19.960 --> 3:51:22.840]  put it in the big county parking lot over here
[3:51:22.840 --> 3:51:26.520]  and when the covid broke out they had a little kindergarten
[3:51:26.520 --> 3:51:31.080]  men and women painting circles on the sidewalk every six feet
[3:51:31.080 --> 3:51:35.320]  and every six feet from each of the vendors so the wind doesn't blow it only
[3:51:35.320 --> 3:51:38.760]  blows the straight lines in exactly six feet
[3:51:38.760 --> 3:51:43.560]  anyway i want to talk a little bit about the economy
[3:51:43.560 --> 3:51:47.640]  the markets are flat today they were down up down up down the whole game is
[3:51:47.640 --> 3:51:50.680]  rigged you have the private equity groups and hedge
[3:51:50.680 --> 3:51:54.280]  funds control the whole deal we're going to the worst financial
[3:51:54.280 --> 3:51:59.400]  crisis in human history again when all else fails they take you to war
[3:51:59.400 --> 3:52:02.760]  and they're going to do it to us this thing a Pelosi going over there that
[3:52:02.760 --> 3:52:05.800]  was ramping up war talk and you saw the
[3:52:05.800 --> 3:52:09.560]  implications of what china did this isn't china
[3:52:09.560 --> 3:52:12.840]  this isn't the china before bill clinton brought them into the world
[3:52:12.840 --> 3:52:17.080]  trade organization and built them up from a nothing country to the
[3:52:17.080 --> 3:52:21.720]  second richest in the world that other slimy piece of low life crap
[3:52:21.720 --> 3:52:25.160]  who gave us nafta and china into the world trade organization
[3:52:25.160 --> 3:52:28.440]  so the manufacturers could go go overseas and get cheap
[3:52:28.440 --> 3:52:33.800]  and go south to get cheap labor so when you look at um
[3:52:33.800 --> 3:52:40.200]  you look at what's going on uh china acts as links with u.s military over
[3:52:40.200 --> 3:52:43.080]  Pelosi trip
[3:52:43.720 --> 3:52:50.680]  and that's from the financial times china vans 2000 food stuff from
[3:52:50.680 --> 3:52:55.080]  taiwan financial times so you put it all together
[3:52:55.080 --> 3:53:00.760]  the sanctions on russia the economics that are being created with war
[3:53:00.760 --> 3:53:04.440]  we're going into a terrible time and they say we're not in recession we're in
[3:53:04.440 --> 3:53:08.120]  recession it was always too too negative court
[3:53:08.120 --> 3:53:12.600]  as a gdp growth until you know they started changing it
[3:53:12.600 --> 3:53:16.760]  and and again this was a egregious provocation but the white house was
[3:53:16.760 --> 3:53:19.960]  totally behind it anybody think that
[3:53:19.960 --> 3:53:23.400]  Pelosi's a top member of the club they're all they're all
[3:53:23.400 --> 3:53:27.960]  they all want to get this thing going so going back to the recession this is
[3:53:27.960 --> 3:53:31.560]  in stagflation as the cover of our magazine shows
[3:53:31.560 --> 3:53:38.760]  it's dragflation the economy's dragging down you look at the gdp numbers
[3:53:38.760 --> 3:53:43.480]  but no one we sent out tens of thousands of press releases calling this
[3:53:43.480 --> 3:53:47.720]  dragflation by the facts you have inflation going up the last
[3:53:47.720 --> 3:53:52.280]  quarter at 9.1 percent and the gdp declining
[3:53:52.280 --> 3:53:55.960]  it's dragging down it's not stagnant it's not stagflation
[3:53:55.960 --> 3:54:00.200]  it's dragflation but you're not allowed to say drag
[3:54:00.200 --> 3:54:04.120]  you can't say gay anymore i'm not happy yeah stop with i don't care who you are
[3:54:04.120 --> 3:54:06.760]  what you do what you want to be what you'll

[3:54:10.760 --> 3:54:13.800]  to be i don't tell you what to believe don't

[3:54:18.200 --> 3:54:25.000]  swallow your crap so as we're looking at what's going on
[3:54:25.000 --> 3:54:28.680]  in the world and the implications of what's going
[3:54:28.680 --> 3:54:33.880]  on we have the biggest economic crisis in human
[3:54:33.880 --> 3:54:38.760]  history and we have world war three heating up
[3:54:38.760 --> 3:54:42.600]  it's right in front of our eyes for all to see
[3:54:42.600 --> 3:54:47.080]  and again we write about it each week in the trends journal
[3:54:47.080 --> 3:54:51.800]  and this new law that they just passed the anti inflation thing is pro inflation
[3:54:51.800 --> 3:54:56.840]  pro fascism gives the bigs more benefits just like that other chip making
[3:54:56.840 --> 3:55:00.760]  deal that they did last week hey you want to build chips over here

[3:55:09.160 --> 3:55:11.800]  and corporate powers buying up corporate bonds
[3:55:11.800 --> 3:55:16.680]  fascism it's fascism what do you mean you're buying up corporate bonds
[3:55:16.680 --> 3:55:20.440]  what do you mean you give the bigs tax breaks what do you mean you give the
[3:55:20.440 --> 3:55:25.640]  bigs all this kind of money so they can build what they want to build
[3:55:25.640 --> 3:55:28.680]  it's fascism
[3:55:29.240 --> 3:55:34.040]  and bernie sanders is a sellout you know we'll have minimal effect this clown
[3:55:34.040 --> 3:55:39.640]  he's a warmongering little freak that that you know just plays the game
[3:55:39.640 --> 3:55:43.800]  it's another little clown that never worked a day in his life
[3:55:43.800 --> 3:55:50.920]  a little jerk one jerk after another telling us what to do
[3:55:51.560 --> 3:55:56.920]  again do what you can with richard nixon the american people don't believe
[3:55:56.920 --> 3:56:00.440]  anything until they've seen it on television
[3:56:00.440 --> 3:56:03.880]  all right and that's why you need to support info
