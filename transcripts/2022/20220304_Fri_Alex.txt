[00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:31.468]   The most important thing for every listener and every viewer to do, in my humble opinion, is to get on their knees several times a day and really pray to God to intercess on our planet and to lift the scales off of Hundreds of millions if not billions of people's eyes to the fact that our planet is being accelerated towards thermal nuclear war and for certain, worldwide depression and economic collapse that will starve not hundreds of millions of people to death, but billions.
[00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:38.971]  That's what the Great Reset is, is a purposeful, controlled collapse, controlled demolition of the world economy.
[00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.230]  Again, thank you for joining us on this live Friday broadcast.
[00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.951]  I'm co-hosting with Owen Schroeder.
[00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:47.512]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.672 --> 00:01:01.057]  And I want to parallel the loss of liberty from Australia to Canada to the United States taking place under the pretext of this proxy war in Ukraine with Russia.
[00:01:01.336 --> 00:01:08.336]   From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:24.336]  [Music]
[00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:26.336]  InfoWars.
[00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:27.432]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:28.032]  Today.
[00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:33.036]  It's Friday, March 4th.
[00:01:33.617 --> 00:01:37.220]  The year is 2022 and all hell is breaking loose.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.742]  Thank you for joining us on this live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:41.243 --> 00:01:45.746]  We'll have live breaking news updates, special guests and more with Owen Schroyer in the studio.
[00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:55.754]  Based in Austin, Texas, I am on the road returning tomorrow and I'm going to be in studio with a special live Saturday broadcast 3 to 5 p.m.
[00:01:56.174 --> 00:01:58.756]  Central Standard Time with special guests and your calls.
[00:01:58.776 --> 00:02:01.878]  Again, this is a live Friday broadcast.
[00:02:02.118 --> 00:02:05.040]  Massive developments unfolding as we speak.
[00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:08.963]  We'll be laying it out in this hour and into the next two hours after that.
[00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:11.905]  But first, John Brennan, former head of the CIA.
[00:02:13.186 --> 00:02:32.992]  The globalists that illegally spied on candidate and then President Trump, the deep state head operative inside the stay behind networks that have hijacked control of US intelligence agencies, literally one of the biggest alligators in the swamp, the head of the intelligence deep state has come out.
[00:02:34.027 --> 00:02:39.467]   said, along with the reporters on the show, we're about to play the clip, that disinformation
[00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:44.706]   is the number one enemy and killing people, and that no information can be allowed on
[00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:49.907]   the internet that questions the official narrative being put out by the corporate media, by the
[00:02:49.907 --> 00:02:53.067]  State Department, by NATO and others.
[00:02:53.067 --> 00:02:58.108]   Now to be clear, I don't like what Putin's doing suppressing information, but what the
[00:02:58.108 --> 00:03:01.387]  West is doing is just as intense or more intense.
[00:03:01.387 --> 00:03:06.587]   We've seen the Ghost of Kiev made up, we've seen the Snake Island massacre made up, we've
[00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:13.307]   seen another dozen or so events totally staged, put out, and then the mother of all of them,
[00:03:13.307 --> 00:03:18.827]   last night AP reports that the reactor's been hit and it's on fire and it's leaking and
[00:03:18.827 --> 00:03:20.627]  five other reactors may blow up.
[00:03:21.425 --> 00:03:27.052]  Then we learned that it was a repaired, decommissioned reactor being updated.
[00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:31.477]  Then we learned that the Russians had not hit the reactor.
[00:03:31.497 --> 00:03:36.889]   We learned there was not Radiation the point is is that it's hoax after hoax after
[00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:42.337]   hoax after hoax and they don't want us on air to be able to Challenge that then Brennan goes on to talk about
[00:03:42.337 --> 00:03:47.179]   overthrowing Putin Killing Putin and we see senator Graham saying the same
[00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:52.078]   thing. So all of this is a type of stuff that starts absolute major wars
[00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:57.718]   But the key here is the linkage by the deep state to the American people and others that simply question the
[00:03:57.718 --> 00:04:01.978]   narratives or show both Sides as claiming we are linked to Russia and that we're
[00:04:01.978 --> 00:04:06.429]   the number one threat Here's the clip, hear it for yourself, and then we'll be right back on the other side.
[00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:17.315]  The need for all of us to treat fake news and propaganda like the lethal threat to democracy that we can see on our TV screens.
[00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:18.056]  It is.
[00:04:20.422 --> 00:04:33.068]  Well, it just shows how autocrats like Mr. Putin and others use information and misinformation, disinformation, to shape the minds and attitudes and actions of their citizenry.
[00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:44.853]  And so, therefore, I think the truth is something that Mr. Putin terribly fears, which is why he's going to try to choke off any type of flow of information about what actually is happening in Ukraine.
[00:04:45.293 --> 00:04:50.492]   But in this day of social media, in this day of text messages and emails and other types of things,
[00:04:50.492 --> 00:04:55.293]   I am certain that more and more of the accurate information is going to get into Russia.
[00:04:55.293 --> 00:04:58.651]  And this is Putin's war. It's not Russia's war.
[00:04:58.651 --> 00:05:05.773]   And I'm sure more and more Russians are going to just be appalled by what is being done
[00:05:05.773 --> 00:05:12.733]   by their country in Ukraine, where they have family ties and other types of ties
[00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:15.372]  that run back centuries upon centuries.
[00:05:15.372 --> 00:05:19.452]   And so, therefore, this is where I think Mr. Putin has a vulnerability,
[00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:22.971]  which is why also I think that what worries me is that...
[00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:26.483]  I think Putin doesn't see any option for him except to double down.
[00:05:26.923 --> 00:05:29.025]  He knows he's not going to be able to turn back the clock.
[00:05:29.285 --> 00:05:33.448]  He's going to be held to account for the death and destruction of Ukraine.
[00:05:34.148 --> 00:05:44.335]  And so therefore, Putin and his henchmen that are around him, I think they believe that the only option they have is to continue with this ferocious intensity and trying to devastate Ukraine.
[00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:52.658]   But I think as Ambassador Soderbergh said, this is only going to lead to I think Putin's unraveling in terms of his position in
[00:05:52.658 --> 00:05:53.617]  the Russian government.
[00:05:53.617 --> 00:05:58.418]   Now, what's going to be the tripwire in terms of pressure on oligarchs and pressure on the
[00:05:58.418 --> 00:06:02.016]   Russian people and commodities and other types of things, it's unclear.
[00:06:02.016 --> 00:06:07.378]   But I do believe that Putin's days are numbered, and maybe in the double digits.
[00:06:07.378 --> 00:06:13.937]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is what InfoWars was built for.
[00:06:15.617 --> 00:06:20.098]   As you see the narrative control, as you see the propaganda, as you see the lies,
[00:06:20.098 --> 00:06:24.418]   as you see the corrupt politicians like Lindsey Graham, who's never seen a war he didn't want you
[00:06:24.418 --> 00:06:29.378]   to die in, InfoWars is here to try to sort it all out, make sense of it all, and that's why you're
[00:06:29.378 --> 00:06:30.737]  tuned in today.
[00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:39.814]  Alex Jones is on the road, however, he's filing reports on vacation, and so we go now to the latest report from Alex Jones.
[00:06:42.492 --> 00:06:46.596]  Thank you again for joining us on this live Friday broadcast.
[00:06:46.976 --> 00:06:47.977]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:48.057 --> 00:06:53.643]  Owen Schroyer will be taking over and riding shotgun with me coming up later in the hour.
[00:06:54.243 --> 00:07:11.338]   I want to be again extremely clear to everyone listening that this war that's broke out is the next phase of the globalist destabilization plan of the planet So that they have a smokescreen during major currency devaluations that are already in full swing.
[00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:23.246]  That said, the rhetoric coming out of Europe, out of NATO, out of the UK and out of the US and Canada is absolutely over the top, as well as Australia and New Zealand.
[00:07:24.252 --> 00:07:30.053]  They are openly, and we'll play some of these clips coming up, calling for the assassination of Putin.
[00:07:30.873 --> 00:07:33.334]  They're calling for the people of Russia to overthrow Putin.
[00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:50.758]  They are also putting out outrageous disinformation that the Russians purposely shelled and caught a six nuclear reactor complex, the largest in Europe, in Ukraine on fire, and that it was releasing radiation and melting down.
[00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.632]  First they'd hit the plant and it was on fire and melting down.
[00:07:55.092 --> 00:07:56.593]  Then it was only a radiation leak.
[00:07:57.053 --> 00:07:59.914]  And then now we learned it wasn't a radiation leak, there wasn't radiation.
[00:08:00.314 --> 00:08:05.237]  And now we learned the plant actually wasn't hit, but some armored vehicles outside of it.
[00:08:05.977 --> 00:08:10.320]  So, whether you love Putin or hate Putin, we need to love the truth here.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.361]  And the first casualty of war, as they say, is truth.
[00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:15.782]  And both sides have been putting out disinformation.
[00:08:16.643 --> 00:08:23.299]   But, as usual, the West Has absolutely won the gold medal or gotten the blue ribbon.
[00:08:24.776 --> 00:08:33.483]  When it comes to total disinformation and propaganda, and we have just been told so many lies so far about Ukraine and the whole situation.
[00:08:34.084 --> 00:08:38.688]  Putin was very, very clear that if NATO continued to expand onto its borders, he was going to attack.
[00:08:39.569 --> 00:08:41.690]  Turns out months before, he told Xi he was going to do it.
[00:08:42.151 --> 00:08:43.532]  He told him weeks before at the Olympics.
[00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:51.679]  Russians were on TV, high-level members of their Duma, their parliament, saying we're going to invade on February 22nd.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.060]  Which they did.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.301]  That was, of course, about a month before that unfolded.
[00:08:58.102 --> 00:09:00.663]  I could even see the signs of those invasions coming in February.
[00:09:01.743 --> 00:09:07.985]  And my military and corporate sources were telling me that Russia would probably invade in February, but also that the Chinese would go into Taiwan.
[00:09:08.105 --> 00:09:09.606]  That has not happened yet.
[00:09:10.908 --> 00:09:12.128]  So those weren't predictions.
[00:09:12.369 --> 00:09:16.970]  Those were things that I was told from people that I trust that were high probability levels.
[00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.411]  And I was very, very clear at the time.
[00:09:19.451 --> 00:09:23.853]  It's just people take shorter clips out of Twitter to make it sound like I'm Nostradamus or something.
[00:09:24.273 --> 00:09:36.137]  That's why it's so important for people to actually tune in to the long-form show, especially the first hour and when we have a special guest on, is that you can hear in-depth analysis, factoids, links, and come to your own conclusions about what I'm saying.
[00:09:36.157 --> 00:09:37.298]  And that's what's so central here.
[00:09:38.627 --> 00:09:53.111]  I'm not going to sit there and take anything Putin says at face value and I'm sure not going to take anything Joe Biden or Boris Johnson or Schmidt over in Germany or any of these people say, do or push.
[00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:54.212]  Excuse me, Schultz.
[00:09:55.132 --> 00:09:59.833]  And I am not going to come to hasty decisions in all of this either.
[00:09:59.854 --> 00:10:01.654]  I'm going to look at the historical context.
[00:10:01.674 --> 00:10:05.015]  I'm going to look forward into what the globalists want.
[00:10:05.055 --> 00:10:07.116]  I'm going to study the larger aspects of it.
[00:10:07.136 --> 00:10:09.897]  And we're going to be laying some of that out coming up here today.
[00:10:09.997 --> 00:10:16.619]   But world champion kickboxer and a well-known talk show host And frequent guests over the years on the show.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:32.391]  Andrew Tate has put out a viral TikTok video where in a profanity-laced two and a half minute rant, he lays out basically my best estimation of what's going on as well.
[00:10:32.931 --> 00:10:40.224]   And he uses some colorful language, you know, when he calls some of the Some of the aboriginal groups in Russia dumb.
[00:10:40.244 --> 00:10:41.165]  What he's saying is they're dumb.
[00:10:41.185 --> 00:10:41.986]  They don't have media.
[00:10:42.447 --> 00:10:43.468]  They don't have social media.
[00:10:43.888 --> 00:10:56.903]  He's being clear about that in that they're being kept in the dark or they're ignorant of what's happening and that that is what Putin is doing is just shipping cannon fodder in to throw them out to the front to then try to get a capitulation.
[00:10:58.337 --> 00:11:00.839]  From the Ukrainians.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.162]  And I've got to say, that's really cold-blooded.
[00:11:03.202 --> 00:11:04.563]  That's a very medieval tactic.
[00:11:05.904 --> 00:11:06.545]  That's what happened.
[00:11:06.585 --> 00:11:07.445]  It's not just in the movie.
[00:11:07.766 --> 00:11:22.300]   Braveheart was actually historic that Longshanks would, in those battles with the Scots and the Irish, would actually have his archers fire into the battle that was already going on, knowing that it would kill some of His people, but kill theirs as well.
[00:11:23.241 --> 00:11:26.144]  And so, there's a lot of barbarous tactics going on.
[00:11:26.204 --> 00:11:34.614]  The Ukrainians are fighting from hospitals and from colleges and from elementary schools as well using jihadi tactics.
[00:11:34.634 --> 00:11:35.676]  They're doing horrible things.
[00:11:36.276 --> 00:11:37.918]  This is a disgusting, horrible...
[00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:43.295]  Basic civil war between the Slavs.
[00:11:44.395 --> 00:11:47.877]  And we sure as hell don't want to have World War 3 over all of this.
[00:11:48.938 --> 00:11:51.580]  And the big overarching issue before I go to this tape clip...
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.681]   is that, again, they're all over the news saying, take anybody's rights away
[00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:58.421]  that doesn't fully get behind this war.
[00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:03.899]   And they're purging Russians out of orchestras in the US and Germany and other areas of the world.
[00:12:03.899 --> 00:12:05.860]  And now they're purging people off TV shows.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.340]  And there's a clip coming up that's on Infowars.com.
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.860]   In Australia, we're an Australian with a Russian background, but he speaks with an Australian accent.
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.019]  He's been there his whole life.
[00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:20.900]   He gets up and talks about the other side, the Russian perspective of the civil war
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:27.140]   and the attacks by the neo-Nazi forces on eastern Ukraine, which is true, and they shut him down and kick him out.
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.659]   So again, this idea that you can't do the other side is extremely dangerous.
[00:12:30.659 --> 00:12:33.980]   And it's what they claim Putin is doing, but instead the West is doing it.
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.941]   So here's some of Mr. Tate and his analysis that I think is dead on.
[00:12:39.298 --> 00:12:42.379]  We'll go to break and come back with a bunch of huge news.
[00:12:42.379 --> 00:12:45.338]  There's also giant news on the Bill Gates and vaccine front.
[00:12:45.338 --> 00:12:47.458]  The whole house of cards is coming down for the globalists.
[00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:48.458]  That's why they're so dangerous.
[00:12:48.458 --> 00:12:52.138]   That's why they're getting ready to launch even greater destabilization is because they're
[00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:53.138]  failing.
[00:12:53.138 --> 00:12:54.138]  That's why we're all in so much danger.
[00:12:54.138 --> 00:12:55.138]  Stay with us.
[00:12:55.138 --> 00:12:56.137]  Here's the theory on all of you.
[00:12:56.137 --> 00:12:57.137]  Putin was W.E.F. along with Trudeau and the rest.
[00:12:57.137 --> 00:12:58.137]  I don't believe any of it.
[00:12:58.137 --> 00:12:59.137]  Yes, there's a war, but in war, it's all about the people.
[00:12:59.137 --> 00:13:12.259]   It's always the peasants and the peons and civilians that die, right?
[00:13:12.234 --> 00:13:27.681]  So what Putin's done is he's mobilized a bunch of bongos and fucking SMOs, Chechens, people without social media, miles away, a bunch of 20-year-olds, told them they were on a military exercise, put them on a military exercise, then told them they were attacked, and sent them into prison.
[00:13:27.841 --> 00:13:28.841]  They don't even know what they're doing.
[00:13:28.861 --> 00:13:30.582]  Most Russians don't even know what's going on.
[00:13:30.622 --> 00:13:31.562]  That's the first thing that's happened.
[00:13:32.162 --> 00:13:35.583]  Ukraine's defending itself, but I'm not trying to sound too crazy.
[00:13:35.763 --> 00:13:39.504]  Alex Jones, seven months ago, said Russia's going to invade Ukraine in February.
[00:13:40.064 --> 00:13:40.505]  Alex Jones?
[00:13:40.545 --> 00:13:41.005]  It's all video!
[00:13:41.065 --> 00:13:42.525]  And he's been proving him wrong.
[00:13:42.545 --> 00:13:44.386]  He's been proving him wrong on the internet.
[00:13:44.426 --> 00:13:48.547]  He goes, don't worry, there's going to be a big thing in February, World War III, to distract us.
[00:13:49.571 --> 00:13:53.152]  Now, are they trying to distract us from the COVID crimes the last few years?
[00:13:53.232 --> 00:13:55.053]  Is it because the international banking system is fucked?
[00:13:55.473 --> 00:13:56.993]  Is it because inflation is out of control?
[00:13:57.013 --> 00:13:59.774]  Do they need this war for some reason?
[00:14:00.234 --> 00:14:03.155]  Because I am at the point now where I have so little faith in politics.
[00:14:03.255 --> 00:14:09.617]  I believe there's somebody above Ukraine and above Putin who's made a call to both of them and said, you're the good guy, you're the bad guy.
[00:14:09.637 --> 00:14:10.617]  We need this now.
[00:14:10.937 --> 00:14:12.897]  Go send some people to get blown up.
[00:14:13.078 --> 00:14:17.259]  Some idiots that nobody has a Facebook account for and no one's going to know they're gone because we all live on the internet.
[00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:18.139]  No one with an Instagram.
[00:14:18.419 --> 00:14:30.527]  Send them to fucking go die, and we're going to call some issues, so we have an excuse for inflation and the banking system failing, and the dollar failing, and all the COVID lies, and everyone getting sick from the vaccine we made them take, and every fucking fucking thing else.
[00:14:31.007 --> 00:14:32.948]  I'm really about that point now, where I have no faith in any of it.
[00:14:32.968 --> 00:14:37.831]  I'm not saying the war isn't happening, but I'm saying the reason they're telling us is fucking bullshit.
[00:14:37.851 --> 00:14:38.052]  I agree.
[00:14:38.392 --> 00:14:41.514]  Why is Putin just evading Ukraine to the point of trying to take Kiev?
[00:14:42.332 --> 00:14:42.872]  To what end?
[00:14:43.052 --> 00:14:43.513]  To what end?
[00:14:43.693 --> 00:14:47.375]  He ain't gonna be able to take Kiev without massive civilian casualties.
[00:14:47.455 --> 00:14:48.956]  No one's gonna accept it.
[00:14:48.976 --> 00:14:50.477]  The Russian populace won't accept it.
[00:14:50.777 --> 00:14:52.598]  Half of them have cousins in Kiev.
[00:14:52.738 --> 00:14:54.179]  The Russian military won't accept it.
[00:14:54.239 --> 00:14:55.620]  A lot of them.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.001]  Most Russian soldiers from Moscow won't fucking attack Kiev.
[00:14:58.142 --> 00:14:58.642]  Attack Kiev?
[00:14:58.682 --> 00:15:00.283]  You need some Eskimo, idiot.
[00:15:00.303 --> 00:15:01.764]  None of this makes sense.
[00:15:02.204 --> 00:15:03.425]  So I'm a conspiracy theorist now.
[00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:04.165]  None of it makes sense.
[00:15:04.185 --> 00:15:05.046]  I'm sitting in the war room.
[00:15:05.686 --> 00:15:07.127]  I'm sitting here in case the Russians come.
[00:15:07.487 --> 00:15:08.788]  But I don't believe in any of it anymore.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.320]  Alex Jones is right.
[00:15:11.341 --> 00:15:11.721]  Alex Jones.
[00:15:11.861 --> 00:15:12.121]  Alex.
[00:15:13.321 --> 00:15:19.764]  So ladies and gentlemen, now you're seeing the next wave of censorship.
[00:15:21.244 --> 00:15:29.287]   Anybody that doesn't drool over Zelensky, anybody that doesn't Put a Ukraine flag in their bio.
[00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:32.009]  You're not allowed to talk about what's happening in Ukraine.
[00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:33.691]  You're not allowed to speculate.
[00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:37.934]  You're not even allowed to be a part of a question-and-answer television segment.
[00:15:38.414 --> 00:15:43.878]  They drag you out of the room for asking about the neo-Nazis, which are on record operating out of eastern Ukraine.
[00:15:45.129 --> 00:15:45.890]  How does this end?
[00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.613]  Somebody in Russia has to step up to the plate.
[00:15:50.154 --> 00:15:51.916]  Is there Brutus in Russia?
[00:15:52.156 --> 00:15:55.939]  Is there a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military?
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:01.284]  The only way this ends, my friend, is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out.
[00:16:01.344 --> 00:16:04.888]  You would be doing your country a great service, and the world a great service.
[00:16:06.249 --> 00:16:08.331]  Well, there's Lindsey the Chickenhawk Graham.
[00:16:09.512 --> 00:16:20.341]  Always in the hip pocket of the neocon warmongers like McCain, the Democratic Party, up there on national television, calling for somebody to kill a major head of state.
[00:16:20.802 --> 00:16:22.583]  What do you think that's going to do to Putin?
[00:16:23.104 --> 00:16:24.405]  What do you think that's going to do with his mindset?
[00:16:24.765 --> 00:16:26.546]  Is that going to help everybody get a peace deal?
[00:16:27.307 --> 00:16:28.287]  Is that going to get a ceasefire?
[00:16:28.327 --> 00:16:36.149]  Is that going to get a demilitarization deal so that Russia will pull out of Ukraine and this threat to our very existence can be stopped?
[00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:38.469]  Or is that going to make things a lot worse?
[00:16:38.489 --> 00:16:40.009]  You don't need me to tell you what it's going to do.
[00:16:40.049 --> 00:16:45.630]  You know that it's all part of how major wars start and how they escalate in full-blown wars.
[00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:54.792]  Go research how World War I started with the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.
[00:16:56.013 --> 00:16:57.115]  And go look at World War II.
[00:16:58.056 --> 00:17:02.803]  It's the same system over and over and over again.
[00:17:04.011 --> 00:17:15.360]  And then meanwhile, as I played in the first segment of this broadcast today, Brennan is on national TV, former head of the CIA, agreeing the number one threat is disinformation and people echoing Russian propaganda.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.962]  That just means if you go, hey, the ghost of Kiev wasn't real.
[00:17:18.382 --> 00:17:20.043]  Hey, Snake Island, they didn't massacre those people.
[00:17:20.083 --> 00:17:21.965]  Hey, the Russians didn't shell the reactor.
[00:17:22.005 --> 00:17:22.966]  It didn't release radiation.
[00:17:23.006 --> 00:17:28.050]  That was made up as a pretext for a no-fly zone, which escalates the war even more.
[00:17:29.636 --> 00:17:47.104]  And if you question that, or if you say, Hey, Sean Hannity, you know, I like you overall, but you shouldn't call for NATO to do airstrikes on the convoy, the 40 mile convoy of Russians and turn it into the highway of death and then turn around and tell the Russians that we don't know who did it.
[00:17:47.604 --> 00:17:49.264]  We don't know who attacked the convoy.
[00:17:49.665 --> 00:17:52.266]  I'm not going to play the clip and I'm not trying to attack Hannity.
[00:17:52.826 --> 00:17:55.287]  It's just, give me a break folks.
[00:17:55.347 --> 00:17:57.148]  I know Hannity's a smart guy, so I can't imagine.
[00:17:58.584 --> 00:18:00.145]  Why the hell he's saying these type of things.
[00:18:00.165 --> 00:18:01.726]  But this is how wars escalate.
[00:18:01.806 --> 00:18:02.987]  Everybody's got to act tough.
[00:18:03.067 --> 00:18:04.188]  Everybody's got to show off.
[00:18:04.248 --> 00:18:12.213]  Everybody's got to go along with the propaganda of, oh my gosh, we've got a reactor on fire now and there's a 40-mile convoy and they're going to kill everybody.
[00:18:12.873 --> 00:18:15.775]  And so, right now, we've got to get in there.
[00:18:16.516 --> 00:18:18.978]  We've got to get in there and we've got to stop before the blood's on our hands.
[00:18:19.818 --> 00:18:24.419]  Well, the blood is on the globalist hands for sending billions of dollars of weapons into Ukraine in the last eight years.
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.420]  Ethnically cleansing Russians, that did go on.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:37.843]  Even the UN admits 14,000 dead Russians that have lived there their whole lives, their families, for 800, 900, in some cases thousands of years before Russia even existed.
[00:18:38.843 --> 00:18:49.465]  And that's just the reality here, is this is a Slavic civil war, just like they have civil wars in African countries, they have civil wars in Asia, civil wars in the Middle East.
[00:18:49.925 --> 00:18:55.086]  We've had a civil war here, we had a civil war against the British, declared our independence, we've had two civil wars here.
[00:18:55.746 --> 00:18:57.446]  We've had wars with Mexico, we've had wars with everybody.
[00:18:57.747 --> 00:18:59.467]  Mexico's had wars with itself all the time.
[00:18:59.747 --> 00:19:01.367]  Do we just run down there and get in the middle of it?
[00:19:01.387 --> 00:19:04.548]  It's like when two pit bulls are fighting, just go stick your hand in the middle, see what happens.
[00:19:05.808 --> 00:19:23.766]  But the globalists can tell the Ukrainians to keep fighting and ship them a bunch of weapons and watch them get massacred because Putin is totally committed and then turn around when those of us that are for peace against the first Iraq war, against the second Iraq war, against the bombing of the Serbs, against Al-Qaeda and the West and then the Arab Spring that CNN promoted.
[00:19:25.171 --> 00:19:25.992]  Going into Syria.
[00:19:26.873 --> 00:19:32.140]  And it was the Russians that went in there and actually stopped that and did the right thing and helped knock out ISIS and actually worked with Trump to do it in our military.
[00:19:32.741 --> 00:19:39.449]  So a lot of people have lionized Putin because he's been against the West and the West has been targeting him and bullying him and bullying us as well.
[00:19:39.489 --> 00:19:42.568]  But there are no good sides on this situation.
[00:19:42.568 --> 00:19:44.168]  And China is really evil.
[00:19:44.168 --> 00:19:46.288]  They're getting ready to try to go into Taiwan using this.
[00:19:46.288 --> 00:19:48.827]  So we need peace and we need peace now.
[00:19:48.827 --> 00:19:49.969]  I'm gonna hand the baton to Owen.
[00:19:49.969 --> 00:19:51.129]  He's got some big breaking news.
[00:19:51.129 --> 00:19:55.008]   I'm gonna come back next segment and I'm gonna get into some of the censorship
[00:19:55.008 --> 00:19:56.508]  that's going on against folks.
[00:19:56.508 --> 00:20:00.208]   They're trying to speak out and how that ties into the incredible police state
[00:20:00.208 --> 00:20:01.327]  in the US and Canada.
[00:20:01.063 --> 00:20:05.103]   Canada, where people who peacefully protested are facing 10 years in prison, they're being
[00:20:05.103 --> 00:20:08.343]   held without bond, and now when they come to court, they're shackled like they're a
[00:20:08.343 --> 00:20:09.342]  serial killer.
[00:20:09.342 --> 00:20:10.502]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:14.183]  I hand the baton to Owen Schroer in the ATX.
[00:20:14.183 --> 00:20:23.023]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, what we've seen since the beginning of Russia's invasion
[00:20:23.023 --> 00:20:33.862]   in Ukraine has been the latest example of the tail wagging the dog, where you get a
[00:20:33.862 --> 00:20:42.142]   nice packaged narrative with a bow on top, with the videos and the pictures that almost
[00:20:42.142 --> 00:20:50.863]   ended up being fake, and the folklore and the fairy tales which ended up being fake,
[00:20:50.863 --> 00:20:58.343]   so that you would get on the side of the globalists with whatever's going to go down in Ukraine.
[00:20:58.343 --> 00:21:08.343]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:18.779]  And then, you intellectually forget about the things that are affecting your life, forget about the problems that we're actually having in this country, and now all of a sudden, Ukraine is your biggest issue.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:33.590]   And that's why you see all the funny memes like this one I have in front of me where it's all the brainwashed COVID-iots And then magically overnight, COVID is no longer their big cause and concern, it's Ukraine.
[00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:39.252]  A situation in which they are completely clueless on, except for the narrative they're being fed.
[00:21:39.292 --> 00:22:15.289]   Now, here's the kind of dangerous aspect about this, and this is why we really have to mind our P's and Q's, because I don't want to fall into a trap Where I know, hey look, the same people that lied to me about weapons of mass destruction, the same people that lied to me about babies in incubators, I mean, you can go back golf-a-tonkin', or we can just go into recent history, the same people that lied to me about COVID, the same people that lied to me about vaccines, the same people that lied to me about Trump, and so now I'm just gonna take anything they say and just assume it's a lie.
[00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:31.607]   But that's the fraction, or the fracture right now in America, And it's like, hey look, I don't wanna, I'm not here to fight Russia's war, I'm not here to fight Ukraine's war, I got my own problems in this country.
[00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:42.435]  But see, whenever you're only allowed to hear one side of the story, you need to be very suspicious of what's going on.
[00:22:43.856 --> 00:22:52.222]   And that's the case right now in Ukraine, where you have Live television shows where they have a panel and they're doing like a town hall.
[00:22:52.742 --> 00:22:53.902]  And we've got the video coming up.
[00:22:53.923 --> 00:22:54.723]  We're going to play it later.
[00:22:57.044 --> 00:23:00.585]  And a guy just says, hey, you know, the U.N.
[00:23:00.605 --> 00:23:02.326]  because the U.N.
[00:23:02.366 --> 00:23:02.886]  is so great.
[00:23:02.906 --> 00:23:05.307]  I mean, you guys, you know, the left loves the U.N.
[00:23:06.968 --> 00:23:09.809]  So the guy just says, hey, the U.N.
[00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:25.267]   recognizes in official public statements That Neo-Nazis, the Azov Battalion, they literally pose with Nazi flags.
[00:23:25.367 --> 00:23:34.451]  I mean, if there's any Neo-Nazis, it's Eastern Ukraine, backed by the CIA, backed by Western influence.
[00:23:35.792 --> 00:23:44.236]  And he goes, hey, you know, the UN recognizes that Neo-Nazis have been killing Russians in Eastern Ukraine for years.
[00:23:46.098 --> 00:23:49.300]  And they even say that it's been 13,000 minimum.
[00:23:49.521 --> 00:23:51.542]  And they say, oh no, no, no!
[00:23:51.802 --> 00:23:53.544]  You're not allowed to talk about that!
[00:23:53.864 --> 00:23:55.065]  Kick him off the set!
[00:23:55.405 --> 00:23:56.406]  Get him out of here!
[00:23:58.587 --> 00:23:59.487]  So what is that about?
[00:24:00.047 --> 00:24:08.950]  Oh my gosh, I'm, uh, I'm an American liberal progressive, I'm fighting Nazis, look at me, Trump's a Nazi, Trump voters are Nazis, hee-hee-hoo!
[00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.991]  And then it's like, hey, here's the UN recognizing real Nazis that Putin's fighting in Russia.
[00:24:13.331 --> 00:24:14.771]  Putin's the bad guy!
[00:24:14.851 --> 00:24:16.932]  Lindsey Graham says I need to die for Putin!
[00:24:18.615 --> 00:24:49.251]   The most important thing for every listener and every viewer to do, in my humble opinion, is to get on their knees several times a day and really pray to God to intercess on our planet and to lift the scales off of Hundreds of millions, if not billions of people's eyes to the fact that our planet is being accelerated towards thermal nuclear war and for certain, worldwide depression and economic collapse that will starve not hundreds of millions of people to death, but billions.
[00:24:49.291 --> 00:24:56.755]  That's what the Great Reset is, is a purposeful, controlled collapse, controlled demolition of the world economy.
[00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.032]  Again, thank you for joining us on this live Friday broadcast.
[00:25:01.052 --> 00:25:02.713]  I'm co-hosting with Owen Schroeder.
[00:25:02.793 --> 00:25:05.294]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:25:05.474 --> 00:25:18.802]  And I want to parallel the loss of liberty from Australia to Canada to the United States taking place under the pretext of this proxy war in Ukraine with Russia.
[00:25:19.824 --> 00:25:29.691]  Coming up in a few minutes, I'm going to play a clip of an Australian man again on an Australian TV show, invited there as a guest to be in the audience, invited to ask a question.
[00:25:30.311 --> 00:25:42.059]  They didn't like his answer, so they throw him out and shun him and say that he is supporting violence, when the West is supporting violence all over the world.
[00:25:42.079 --> 00:25:44.321]  Whether you agree with the man or not, he certainly has valid points.
[00:25:45.489 --> 00:25:50.732]  From his perspective, when you have this type of shunning, this is the stuff you see in the Soviet Union.
[00:25:51.292 --> 00:25:52.733]  This is the stuff you see all over the world.
[00:25:53.233 --> 00:26:04.579]  Then I'm going to play a clip, a short clip, of a North Texas University, where a father, who's been on our show, had his young son taken away, who doesn't even want to be a girl, but the mother says the boy wants to be a girl.
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.501]  I've seen video of the boy saying he doesn't want to be a girl.
[00:26:08.281 --> 00:26:14.986]   Taken away, and Then they're preparing the chemical sterilization.
[00:26:16.047 --> 00:26:17.287]  He's very little, but in a couple of years.
[00:26:18.027 --> 00:26:34.426]   He tried to go speak at a university by the young conservative groups that invited him and the left came like a sickening cult and beat On their tables, saying, no, you're attacking, quote, trans people.
[00:26:34.766 --> 00:26:41.988]  No, we're standing up against the globalist Tavistock Institute, big tech move to sterilize young boys in America.
[00:26:42.808 --> 00:26:52.171]  Massive sterilization went on in the 20s, 30s, and 40s in eugenics in the U.S., actually into the 80s in leftist areas like Washington State and Oregon.
[00:26:52.191 --> 00:26:53.652]  It was still going on in the 80s.
[00:26:54.756 --> 00:27:07.889]  And this is their stealth program to bring in this mutilation, this abuse, and to target children who aren't of age to choose and even do surgical removals of their genitals by age 7 in the UK and age 9 in the United States.
[00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:18.217]   And I've talked to the doctors and nurses in Austin and in Houston and it's been in the news where you will have these couples bring in their little boys.
[00:27:18.357 --> 00:27:34.929]   Usually it's You know a LGBT woman and woman man and man and they want the penis and the testicles cut off and The left has now said that that's what they want For Ukraine and Putin has even talked about that in some of his speeches.
[00:27:34.989 --> 00:27:42.994]  So I'm going to play these clips from North Texas and another one from Australia back to back here in a few minutes.
[00:27:44.475 --> 00:27:47.557]  But the even bigger issue is this.
[00:27:47.937 --> 00:27:50.419]  And this should send chills up everybody's spine.
[00:27:50.479 --> 00:27:57.724]  I told everybody that if they didn't stop this and if we didn't get attention on this, that it would only get 10 times worse.
[00:27:58.857 --> 00:27:59.698]  And now it has.
[00:28:00.478 --> 00:28:08.543]  Breaking Freedom Convoy organizer, Tamara Litch, shackled in court.
[00:28:09.463 --> 00:28:10.224]  She was arrested.
[00:28:10.384 --> 00:28:12.025]  She's being held without bail until trial.
[00:28:12.045 --> 00:28:12.945]  That could be up to a year.
[00:28:13.545 --> 00:28:18.448]  She's facing 10 years in prison for peaceful protesting, now listed as an act of terrorism.
[00:28:18.488 --> 00:28:22.390]  Now, quote, mischief making is now the equivalent of terror.
[00:28:23.251 --> 00:28:26.653]  And when she appeared in court yesterday, she was shackled.
[00:28:27.728 --> 00:28:30.450]  With her hands shackled to her waist like she was a serial killer.
[00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:38.015]  Freedom Convoy organizer Tamara Lich appeared in court on Wednesday seeking a bail review.
[00:28:38.075 --> 00:28:45.520]  Lich, who was denied bail last week, appeared in court wearing shackles around her feet, which made it difficult for her to move and also at her waist.
[00:28:47.262 --> 00:28:48.222]  And it just goes on.
[00:28:48.242 --> 00:28:50.844]  It just goes on from there.
[00:28:51.184 --> 00:28:55.968]  I mean, Trudeau said that he wanted to be a dictator.
[00:28:57.282 --> 00:28:58.162]  And now he is.
[00:28:58.242 --> 00:28:59.183]  And who did he study under?
[00:28:59.203 --> 00:29:00.363]  Who does he take direct orders from?
[00:29:00.423 --> 00:29:01.484]  Who brags he takes orders?
[00:29:02.164 --> 00:29:02.705]  Klaus Schwab.
[00:29:03.725 --> 00:29:04.585]  And that's what this is.
[00:29:04.986 --> 00:29:10.208]  They need a smokescreen for the worldwide collapse, the mass starvation, everything that's coming, and the police state crackdowns in the West.
[00:29:10.828 --> 00:29:17.831]  You can't criticize anything they're doing when they lie about a nuclear reactor, or six reactors, fired on with artillery on fire, melting down.
[00:29:17.871 --> 00:29:19.012]  Then it was, oh, it's just a leak.
[00:29:19.432 --> 00:29:20.492]  Oh, actually, it was just a fire.
[00:29:20.553 --> 00:29:21.493]  Oh, actually, nothing happened.
[00:29:22.779 --> 00:29:26.825]  Because they can't get away with these massive lies saying that men can take over all of women's sports.
[00:29:27.045 --> 00:29:28.467]  You question it, you're censored.
[00:29:28.908 --> 00:29:30.530]  Or, we're going to go to war with Russia.
[00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:31.492]  You question it, you're censored.
[00:29:31.672 --> 00:29:32.713]  You want peace, you're censored.
[00:29:32.934 --> 00:29:35.578]  They can't get away with this horrible, evil agenda.
[00:29:36.198 --> 00:29:37.300]  Unless... we...
[00:29:38.161 --> 00:29:41.884]  Submit to them and unless we don't have speech and RT was taken off in Europe.
[00:29:41.924 --> 00:29:47.427]  So that took it off in the UK now It's been shut down here in the United States as of yesterday.
[00:29:47.707 --> 00:29:51.910]  You can say well, I don't want to see that RT propaganda Well, don't you want to hear what the other side has to say?
[00:29:52.271 --> 00:29:53.531]  Isn't that what freedom is all about?
[00:29:54.092 --> 00:30:10.042]   I mean back in World War two they played clips at the movie theaters and the newsreels of what Hitler said Americans were able to hear what Hitler said it was only Nazi Germany that you couldn't hear what the outsiders were saying and it was punishable by prison or death so here are Some of these clips back-to-back.
[00:30:10.242 --> 00:30:16.286]  First what happened in Australia, and then what happened in North Texas, and then Owen's got some more key information to break down.
[00:30:16.326 --> 00:30:22.450]  I'll be back in the next segment with the Bill Gates news that is super good news, but also super dangerous at the same time.
[00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:23.991]  InfoWars.com.
[00:30:24.291 --> 00:30:25.212]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:30:26.508 --> 00:30:37.031]  So as someone who comes from the Russian community here in Australia, I've been pretty outraged by the narrative created by our media depicting the Ukraine as the good guy and Russia as the bad guy.
[00:30:37.071 --> 00:30:44.093]  Believe it or not, there are a lot of Russians here and around the world that support what Putin is doing in the Ukraine, myself included.
[00:30:45.093 --> 00:30:58.663]  Since 2014, the Ukrainian government, together with Nazi groups like the Azov Battalion, have besieged the Russian populations in the Donbass, killing an estimated 13,000 people, according to the United Nations.
[00:31:00.985 --> 00:31:02.266]  Could I finish?
[00:31:02.306 --> 00:31:05.527]  Just quickly finish and then we'll come to that and get that to the panel.
[00:31:05.627 --> 00:31:10.590]  So yeah, my question is, you know, where was your outpouring of grief and concern for those thousands of mostly Russians?
[00:31:11.691 --> 00:31:21.456]  Okay, your question earlier about Russia and it's been playing on my mind and Sasha, people here have been talking about family.
[00:31:22.216 --> 00:31:30.421]  Who are suffering and people are dying and I understand you wanted to ask your question about is there some reasoning for this?
[00:31:31.001 --> 00:31:38.565]  But you supported what's happening, hearing that people are dying and can I just say I'm just not comfortable with you being here.
[00:31:38.745 --> 00:31:39.566]  Could you please leave?
[00:31:41.512 --> 00:31:45.513]  I've been... It's really... No, Sasha, I'm sorry.
[00:31:45.774 --> 00:31:47.034]  You could ask a question.
[00:31:47.454 --> 00:31:50.755]  You could ask a question, but we cannot advocate violence.
[00:31:50.795 --> 00:31:51.976]  I should have asked you to leave then.
[00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:53.276]  It's been playing on my mind.
[00:31:53.736 --> 00:31:55.597]  And I'm sorry, but I have to ask you to leave, please.
[00:31:55.877 --> 00:31:58.518]  Okay, well, could I... No, no, no, please, please, please.
[00:31:59.098 --> 00:32:01.119]  Just, just, just, just out of respect...
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.942]  Just no, please, we're not having the conversation, Sasha.
[00:32:07.382 --> 00:32:10.284]  We can't have people advocating violence.
[00:32:11.004 --> 00:32:12.385]  And I should have asked you to leave.
[00:32:12.465 --> 00:32:13.486]  It's been playing on my mind.
[00:32:13.526 --> 00:32:16.528]  I wanted to have a proper conversation about these things.
[00:32:16.968 --> 00:32:18.129]  But I have to ask you to leave.
[00:32:18.189 --> 00:32:18.830]  I'm really sorry.
[00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:20.831]  Okay.
[00:32:20.871 --> 00:32:21.551]  I'm sorry for that.
[00:32:21.631 --> 00:32:22.812]  You know, these things happen.
[00:32:23.293 --> 00:32:24.333]  It's live television.
[00:32:24.393 --> 00:32:25.574]  You think about these things.
[00:32:25.654 --> 00:32:36.101]   It's really been troubling me that we can have a conversation and we can look at where the arguments are and we can try to look at The sides of the argument.
[00:32:36.642 --> 00:32:38.043]  We can't have that.
[00:32:38.403 --> 00:32:38.843]  I'm sorry.
[00:32:38.863 --> 00:32:42.506]  It should have happened earlier.
[00:32:42.945 --> 00:32:44.945]  [Bleep] these fascists!
[00:32:44.945 --> 00:32:46.945]  [Bleep] these fascists!
[00:32:46.945 --> 00:32:48.945]  [Bleep] these fascists!
[00:32:48.945 --> 00:32:50.945]  [Bleep] these fascists!
[00:32:50.945 --> 00:32:52.945]  [Bleep] these fascists!
[00:32:52.945 --> 00:32:54.945]  [Bleep] these fascists!
[00:32:54.945 --> 00:32:56.945]  [Bleep] these fascists!
[00:32:56.945 --> 00:32:58.945]  [Bleep] these fascists!
[00:32:58.945 --> 00:33:07.945]   So, ladies and gentlemen, you're witnessing mass formation psychosis, mass mental illness,
[00:33:07.945 --> 00:33:13.945]   MK-Ultra brainwashing, Stockholm syndrome on a mass scale.
[00:33:13.916 --> 00:33:15.456]  And you just see all the hypocrisy.
[00:33:15.976 --> 00:33:21.418]  Oh, we can't advocate violence, but by the way, let's blow Putin off the map.
[00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:22.718]  But don't advocate violence.
[00:33:22.838 --> 00:33:24.738]  We don't do that here, but let's all kill Putin.
[00:33:26.359 --> 00:33:26.999]  But you see, that's...
[00:33:28.044 --> 00:33:39.092]  That's the state of political discussion right now in the West, is, oh, I'm a liberal, I have the moral high ground, I don't like what you're saying, so just leave.
[00:33:39.112 --> 00:33:41.574]  It's like, hey, here's the facts, let's have a discussion.
[00:33:41.734 --> 00:33:43.236]  No, I don't like those facts.
[00:33:43.996 --> 00:33:46.378]  So just leave me to my brainwashing.
[00:33:47.879 --> 00:33:53.163]  Melinda Gates, the longtime wife of Bill Gates III.
[00:33:54.844 --> 00:33:58.066]  The most powerful eugenicist depopulationist on the earth.
[00:33:59.086 --> 00:34:00.407]  Divorced him last year.
[00:34:01.407 --> 00:34:23.799]  And the divorce is just now being finalized, and so she went on national television to say that Bill Gates was cavorting with and spending time with someone that when she met him, she said he was evil, personified, and abhorrent.
[00:34:25.066 --> 00:34:31.209]  He was, quote, worse than the devil himself.
[00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:38.872]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, March 4th, worldwide broadcast.
[00:34:40.353 --> 00:35:13.525]   And I just want to be very specific with the listeners and viewers to understand that we should be thanking God right now that every aspect of the deadly COVID-19 vaccine rollout is coming apart and their whole systems at Moderna and Pfizer are being exposed it would take hours to go over it all but you know as much as I do how important it is to continue to spread the word to others that aren't even partially informed that Moderna and Pfizer now admit that the virus was made in a lab and the Moderna had a patent on it in 2000
[00:35:15.927 --> 00:35:23.207]   and 16 or that the so-called vaccines of gene therapy that now goes in and reprograms and
[00:35:23.207 --> 00:35:24.766]  attacks your liver.
[00:35:24.766 --> 00:35:27.327]  Well, that wasn't a surprise.
[00:35:27.327 --> 00:35:34.445]   Remember why over and over again throughout the last 25 years, they could never approve
[00:35:34.445 --> 00:35:36.966]  gene therapies?
[00:35:36.966 --> 00:35:40.567]   Because in most cases, 90 plus percent of the time, there was no side effects.
[00:35:41.182 --> 00:35:50.029]  But in around 9% of the time, depending on the study, you had very, very serious side effects, including death, where the liver basically liquefies.
[00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:57.795]  It goes in and changes the entire makeup of the liver and how it operates.
[00:35:58.015 --> 00:36:17.710]   So, why is Melinda Gates On national TV saying that she's really mad at Bill and that she divorced Bill Gates because in part he kept making her go meet with Jeffrey Epstein, who she described as evil personified, which he was.
[00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:19.871]  Creepiest person you can imagine.
[00:36:19.892 --> 00:36:20.712]  Just look at photos of him.
[00:36:21.153 --> 00:36:22.414]  Makes the hair on the back of my neck crawl.
[00:36:23.942 --> 00:36:24.623]  Why is she doing that?
[00:36:24.663 --> 00:36:27.005]  Well, hey, maybe she wasn't evil the whole time.
[00:36:27.025 --> 00:36:28.486]  Maybe she was deceived.
[00:36:28.506 --> 00:36:30.067]  Maybe she was a beard for Gates.
[00:36:30.467 --> 00:36:41.456]  Not for him being homosexual, but for him being an evil, evil man that just wanted a woman as a front for his international charity that was really a globalist depopulation murder operation.
[00:36:42.437 --> 00:36:45.880]  It was right after she went on national TV with him about eight, nine months ago.
[00:36:47.461 --> 00:36:52.246]  And Bill said, no, we don't put any type of microchips in the vaccines, no type of tracking systems.
[00:36:52.726 --> 00:36:56.530]  And then it came out that the very virus itself is a trackable nanotech.
[00:36:57.231 --> 00:37:03.337]  And they're also putting graphene oxide in, that then grows circuits in the body, that she began the divorce.
[00:37:03.417 --> 00:37:23.582]   And I said at the time, from my sources and information that I had, that it was about the fact that Bill was using Epstein was one of his main financiers to go out and corrupt scientists and others so that Bill Gates could control the different medical boards around the US and the major universities which we know he does and he does around the world.
[00:37:24.903 --> 00:37:39.721]   So with all this Russia stuff going on, all these incredible things happening, it is such a big, big deal to have Melinda Gates, now Melinda French, Her maiden name come out against him.
[00:37:39.761 --> 00:37:42.686]  So here is this historic clip.
[00:37:43.167 --> 00:37:45.451]  I'm going to come back and add some important commentary.
[00:37:46.809 --> 00:37:56.972]  You know it was also widely reported that Bill had a friendship or business or some kind of contact with Jeffrey Epstein and that you were not, that that was very upsetting to you.
[00:37:57.052 --> 00:38:00.494]  Did that play a role in the divorce at all in this process?
[00:38:01.174 --> 00:38:04.875]  Yeah, as I said it's not one thing, it was many things.
[00:38:05.395 --> 00:38:09.237]  But I did not like that he'd had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no.
[00:38:11.037 --> 00:38:12.239]  And you made that clear to him?
[00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:13.920]  I made that clear to him.
[00:38:14.401 --> 00:38:17.524]  I also met Jeffrey Epstein exactly one time.
[00:38:17.584 --> 00:38:18.064]  Did you?
[00:38:18.185 --> 00:38:25.632]  Yes, because I wanted to see who this man was and I regretted it from the second I stepped in the door.
[00:38:25.652 --> 00:38:27.093]  He was abhorrent.
[00:38:27.634 --> 00:38:28.955]   He was Yeah.
[00:38:28.835 --> 00:38:34.034]   personified. I had nightmares about it afterwards. So you know my heart breaks
[00:38:34.034 --> 00:38:38.114]   for these young women because that's how I felt and here I'm an older woman my
[00:38:38.114 --> 00:38:41.253]  God I feel terrible for those young women. It was awful.
[00:38:41.253 --> 00:38:44.994]   You felt that the moment you walked in? I didn't realize that. Yeah and you shared that
[00:38:44.994 --> 00:38:50.054]   with Bill and he still continued to spend time with him? Any of the questions
[00:38:50.054 --> 00:38:56.673]   remaining about what Bill's relationship there was those are for Bill to answer.
[00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:55.251]  Okay.
[00:38:55.351 --> 00:38:57.474]  But I made it very clear how I felt about him.
[00:38:58.435 --> 00:39:03.582]  I think... So why is Melinda French Gates coming out and doing this now?
[00:39:04.443 --> 00:39:07.646]  Well, you can speculate that maybe she has a soul, maybe she has a heart, maybe she was ignorant.
[00:39:08.166 --> 00:39:12.950]  What we do know is she's now aware of the evil and she's getting out ahead of it.
[00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:22.197]  You wouldn't make statements like she just made unless you were talking about total horror and total corruption that you know cannot be hidden.
[00:39:22.938 --> 00:39:27.181]  And so that when more of it comes out, you will be distanced from your husband.
[00:39:27.782 --> 00:39:32.505]  This is a desperate, desperate, panicked move by any yardstick.
[00:39:33.326 --> 00:39:37.593]  And it illustrates major blood in the water for the establishment.
[00:39:38.595 --> 00:39:43.763]  Their entire system is based not just on bribery, not just on murder.
[00:39:45.219 --> 00:39:50.219]   but on pedophilia because people can plead out to the FBI for murder or bribery or things
[00:39:50.219 --> 00:39:51.219]  like that.
[00:39:51.219 --> 00:39:54.077]   I mean, even for murder, if you're in the mafia and you bust your boss, you might get
[00:39:54.077 --> 00:39:57.499]  five years instead of life or the death penalty.
[00:39:57.499 --> 00:40:01.258]   But nobody is going to let you get off for molesting children.
[00:40:01.258 --> 00:40:05.057]   Nobody's going to let you get off from the long sentences or being executed for killing
[00:40:05.057 --> 00:40:06.298]  children.
[00:40:06.298 --> 00:40:12.179]   And that's why at the bottom of this globalist network is really, really sinister stuff.
[00:40:12.179 --> 00:40:16.577]   And that's why what went on at Epstein Island needs to continue to be exposed and investigated.
[00:40:16.577 --> 00:40:19.018]  That's why Atlantic Monthly needs to be investigated.
[00:40:19.018 --> 00:40:23.938]   When you see it promoting pedophilia and censorship and globalism and world government and Brennan
[00:40:23.938 --> 00:40:29.938]   and all these people, you have to understand that the alumni and many of the top writers
[00:40:29.938 --> 00:40:35.617]   and the owner of that, I'm just singling one group out right now, are heavily, heavily
[00:40:35.617 --> 00:40:40.338]   involved on record, including Steve Jobs' wife with Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:40:40.382 --> 00:40:43.585]  So they were just wallowing in the satanic evil.
[00:40:44.642 --> 00:40:49.325]  Now, coming up next hour, Owen's got a lot of special guests and a lot of breaking news on the situation with Russia and more.
[00:40:49.345 --> 00:40:50.886]  In fact, he's about to take over here in a moment.
[00:40:50.946 --> 00:40:53.228]  I'll be back again tomorrow, 3 to 5 p.m.
[00:40:53.708 --> 00:40:58.431]  I promise a live transmission, a special Saturday commercial-free transmission, 3 to 5 p.m.
[00:40:58.471 --> 00:41:00.973]  Central, and then, of course, the Sunday show, 4 to 8 p.m.
[00:41:00.993 --> 00:41:02.494]  with myself and Owen Schroer and others.
[00:41:03.194 --> 00:41:06.436]  But just please understand that we're backed by you, the listeners.
[00:41:06.456 --> 00:41:08.057]  We're not backed by Soros.
[00:41:08.077 --> 00:41:09.457]  We're not backed by the big billionaires.
[00:41:10.018 --> 00:41:18.082]  You know, there are some good billionaires out there, and I wish we were backed by them, but the point is we are backed by the American people.
[00:41:18.102 --> 00:41:20.523]  90% of our backing comes from products we directly sell.
[00:41:20.583 --> 00:41:40.902]   The other 10% from great Sponsors that we have and yes we do have some bigger donors that have given us hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years and without them we wouldn't be here either but 90% of what we do is from your direct purchases and again I'd say 9% of the 10% that's left is from our listeners.
[00:41:41.963 --> 00:42:09.720]   Supporting our sponsors so 99% of the support to keep them fours on the air is directly from folks like you out there that are supporting us and So I want to just remind you again that this information is not going to get out without you in full war store.com We've got to get the funds in so even though we're gonna sell out x3 for your body for your immune system 50% off still winter Sun 50% off still brain force Ultra back in stock, 40% off.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:15.085]  All of it at infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:42:15.105 --> 00:42:18.628]  And I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air.
[00:42:18.708 --> 00:42:19.669]  You are the sponsors.
[00:42:20.089 --> 00:42:21.391]  You are the ones that did all this.
[00:42:21.871 --> 00:42:24.333]  All the success we're having is because of you, and we're so close to winning.
[00:42:25.034 --> 00:42:32.175]  But the globalists now are going to throw everything they've got at us, and as long as we're here on air exposing them, as long as you're speaking out, we've got a real chance of stopping this before it gets a lot worse.
[00:42:32.515 --> 00:42:33.696]  But regardless, God's watching.
[00:42:33.716 --> 00:42:34.956]  We're going to do the right thing.
[00:42:35.336 --> 00:42:38.816]  We're going to fight on to the end, because this is all really just a test on this planet, and that's what it's all about.
[00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:42.537]  So thank you for making InfoWars a pillar of liberty.
[00:42:42.897 --> 00:42:43.817]  The credit goes to you.
[00:42:43.837 --> 00:42:45.038]  I want to thank the listeners.
[00:42:45.298 --> 00:42:48.498]  Now back to Owen Schroer and I broadcast InfoWars.com.
[00:42:48.738 --> 00:42:52.179]  Tomorrow's news today, and it's powered by InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:42:53.871 --> 00:43:07.728]   You know, I think if Sean Hannity and Lindsey Graham Wanna start a war with Russia and want Putin dead so bad, I think we should just airdrop them into Moscow.
[00:43:08.708 --> 00:43:21.535]  Or let's just, let's just, you know, get them some military equipment and we'll get them some body armor and some, some weapons and ammunition and let's just, let's just drop Sean Hannity and Lindsey Graham, airdrop them into Russia and they can go kill Putin for us.
[00:43:21.655 --> 00:43:21.955]  Please!
[00:43:22.035 --> 00:43:23.776]  I mean, you're so tough, Sean Hannity.
[00:43:23.816 --> 00:43:26.037]  I mean, Lindsey Graham, you're, you're real tough.
[00:43:26.077 --> 00:43:29.239]  I mean, you see Lindsey Graham and then you just, emanates toughness.
[00:43:30.819 --> 00:43:31.300]  No, no, no.
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:40.351]  Lindsey Graham is a blackmailed homosexual who has never seen a war he didn't want you to die in.
[00:43:41.653 --> 00:43:52.235]  So that him and his buddies like Sean Hannity can make millions and millions of dollars on their stock options in Raytheon and Lockheed Martin and pretend to be tough guys on TV.
[00:43:52.535 --> 00:44:05.518]  You know, and Sean Hannity was starting to come around, and you're like, hey, you know, here's a war hawk that's starting to come around, maybe jump on the America First bandwagon, and then he just throws it all right back at our face and says, we need to start a nuclear war with Russia.
[00:44:05.738 --> 00:44:06.398]  Well, go ahead!
[00:44:06.658 --> 00:44:10.259]  Let's give the nukes to Hannity and Graham, and you can go nuke Putin yourself.
[00:44:10.099 --> 00:44:23.338]  Good luck!
[00:44:24.284 --> 00:44:34.850]   If you will simply get X3 with all three types of good iodine that boost your immune system and help everything that goes on in your body at the cellular level, It will change your life.
[00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:35.930]  It will invigorate you.
[00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:36.931]  It will empower you.
[00:44:37.311 --> 00:44:40.293]  Almost everyone has iodine deficiency.
[00:44:40.373 --> 00:44:41.913]  Look into it for yourself.
[00:44:41.993 --> 00:44:43.334]  It's the opposite of fluoride.
[00:44:43.434 --> 00:44:45.055]  It's the good halogen.
[00:44:45.655 --> 00:44:48.877]  And then your purchase of X3 funds our operation.
[00:44:49.037 --> 00:44:54.380]  Now a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because of the lockdowns and supply chain breakdowns.
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:56.641]  They were sold out of X3 for a long time.
[00:44:57.181 --> 00:44:59.763]  And I had it on sale for 50% off and a lot of folks were getting it.
[00:45:00.163 --> 00:45:01.324]  And I was thinking, you know what?
[00:45:01.344 --> 00:45:04.445]  I'm going to bring it back on sale again, just until it sells out.
[00:45:05.005 --> 00:45:11.949]  Because even though we won't make as much money in the long run, a lot of folks need this product, and we need to get the money from the sales in now to stay on air.
[00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:16.051]  So your X3 right now at 50% off at infowarestore.com.
[00:45:20.633 --> 00:45:22.794]  You are a true believer.
[00:45:22.814 --> 00:45:23.934]  Blessings of the state.
[00:45:23.974 --> 00:45:26.295]  Please forgive the blessings of the masses.
[00:45:26.496 --> 00:45:29.357]  Let us be thankful we have an occupation.
[00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:41.657]  Increase production, prevent accidents, and be happy.
[00:45:42.438 --> 00:45:51.586]  An all-powerful biomedical world government that seeks to end the male-female relationship and turn us into drugged-out, shaved-head slaves.
[00:45:52.707 --> 00:45:59.012]  Where do you think George Lucas got that plan for his student film in the 60s and his first movie in the early 70s?
[00:46:00.498 --> 00:46:02.059]  Well, Lucas has talked about it before.
[00:46:02.539 --> 00:46:04.739]  I was always struck with the fact that we were living in the future.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:10.461]  If you were to make a film about the future, the way to do it would be to use real things because we are living in the future.
[00:46:11.222 --> 00:46:17.804]  Those were plans being floated around since the 30s at major US and European British universities.
[00:46:18.964 --> 00:46:20.905]  Aldous Huxley wrote Brave New World in 1931.
[00:46:24.306 --> 00:46:26.847]  So people keep asking how I know what's coming next.
[00:46:26.967 --> 00:46:28.188]  Are you kidding me?
[00:46:28.208 --> 00:46:32.450]  THX 1138 is the actual plan!
[00:46:33.531 --> 00:46:42.516]  As technology becomes more and more complicated, it becomes necessary to have more and more elaborate organizations, more hierarchical organizations.
[00:46:43.036 --> 00:46:49.219]  And incidentally, the advance of technology has been accompanied by an advance in the science of organization.
[00:46:49.259 --> 00:46:54.863]   It's now possible to Make organizations on a larger scale than was ever possible before.
[00:46:55.643 --> 00:47:09.512]  And so that you have more and more people living their lives out as subordinates in these hierarchical systems controlled by bureaucracies, either the bureaucracies of big business or the bureaucracies of big government.
[00:47:10.332 --> 00:47:15.476]  Excellencies, the future is already here.
[00:47:16.716 --> 00:47:18.638]  The future has begun.
[00:47:19.767 --> 00:47:20.728]  It's a new system.
[00:47:21.748 --> 00:47:22.408]  It changes us.
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:33.934]  Because it's a fusion of our physical, digital, and biological spheres.
[00:47:35.215 --> 00:47:38.176]  It's an integration of those spheres.
[00:47:38.777 --> 00:47:42.659]  Just think of senses planted into our brains.
[00:47:44.281 --> 00:47:45.822]  The opportunities are immense.
[00:47:46.362 --> 00:47:47.703]  Everyone will wear white.
[00:47:48.183 --> 00:47:49.484]  Everyone will have shaved heads.
[00:47:49.904 --> 00:47:51.404]  Everyone will be controlled by robots.
[00:47:52.225 --> 00:47:56.767]  You will be forcibly drugged and you will worship an antichrist robot.
[00:47:57.587 --> 00:47:58.428]  You want to live like that?
[00:47:58.968 --> 00:48:00.129]  That's where this all goes.
[00:48:00.649 --> 00:48:03.470]  It doesn't go where you're trendy and fun and you're in the metaverse.
[00:48:04.051 --> 00:48:04.631]  It ends.
[00:48:05.825 --> 00:48:08.386]  With you as a slave of robots.
[00:48:08.946 --> 00:48:09.847]  This is their religion.
[00:48:09.927 --> 00:48:12.428]  You don't get in the club of Rome.
[00:48:12.728 --> 00:48:14.169]  You don't get in the Bilderberg Group.
[00:48:14.509 --> 00:48:17.610]  You don't get into these facilities.
[00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:27.637]   You don't get We are probably one of the last generations of homo sapiens.
[00:48:28.078 --> 00:48:35.344]  Because in the coming generations, we will learn how to engineer bodies and brains and minds.
[00:48:35.844 --> 00:48:41.108]  Now how exactly will the future masters of the planet look like?
[00:48:41.709 --> 00:48:46.373]  This will be decided by the people who own the data.
[00:48:46.593 --> 00:48:48.815]  Now why is data so important?
[00:48:50.055 --> 00:49:01.167]  It's important because we've reached the point when we can hack not just computers, we can hack human beings and other organisms.
[00:49:02.176 --> 00:49:08.258]  The difference of this forced industrial revolution is it doesn't change what you are doing.
[00:49:08.278 --> 00:49:14.200]  It changes you if you take genetic editing just as an example.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.401]  And we have to integrate everybody into this process.
[00:49:17.461 --> 00:49:19.062]  It has to be an open process.
[00:49:19.502 --> 00:49:43.640]   That's the reason why I'm so keen to provide also a forward-looking dimension to this great reset initiative by integrating the 10,000 global shapers, leaders between 20 and 30 years old, who not only leaders, I mean, they represent society in 400 different cities of the world.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.484]  It's the end of our species as we know it and everything they're doing is forced.
[00:49:48.104 --> 00:49:50.985]  And billions of people took into their body the experimental GMO.
[00:49:51.425 --> 00:49:56.667]  The first gift they gave us was a poison spike protein that cuts the double helix and begins the process of killing us.
[00:49:56.707 --> 00:49:57.388]  Can you hear me?
[00:49:57.948 --> 00:49:58.648]  Stay calm.
[00:49:58.988 --> 00:50:00.489]  Everything will be alright.
[00:50:00.569 --> 00:50:03.310]  Everything will be alright.
[00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:06.651]  We are here to help you.
[00:50:06.751 --> 00:50:10.112]  And you can find that report at band.video.
[00:50:10.552 --> 00:50:12.873]  The transhumanist war has begun.
[00:50:13.113 --> 00:50:13.353]  No!
[00:50:13.794 --> 00:50:14.734]  I will stay human!
[00:50:15.825 --> 00:50:22.131]  And we are now joined by Karen Kingston, who is a Pfizer whistleblower.
[00:50:23.445 --> 00:50:35.029]  And Karen, the last time I was on with you, we were actually discussing a study that came out that was very shocking and abhorrent about what the COVID-19 vaccine is doing.
[00:50:35.049 --> 00:50:37.150]  You've had even more time to properly vet that.
[00:50:37.891 --> 00:50:46.114]  But even since that, we now have the Pfizer data that I can't even believe that I'm reporting this, but it's just it's Pfizer's own numbers, folks.
[00:50:47.134 --> 00:50:53.022]  In a three-month survey, a 3% fatality rate of the Pfizer vaccine.
[00:50:53.102 --> 00:51:03.216]  Now, Karen, knowing all of this news and the warnings you've been issuing about Pfizer, what is your take on all this and what do you think the American people need to know?
[00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:08.171]  Well, these are bioweapons.
[00:51:08.311 --> 00:51:09.511]  Stop calling them vaccines.
[00:51:09.571 --> 00:51:16.373]  Stop participating in this mass plan to permanently harm, disable, and kill Americans and our children.
[00:51:16.553 --> 00:51:21.254]  So do not use the vernacular of the plan and the lies.
[00:51:21.314 --> 00:51:23.995]  So don't call these vaccines and stop using the term COVID-19.
[00:51:24.995 --> 00:51:26.376]  COVID-19 is a list of symptoms.
[00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:28.058]  Some of the symptoms are no symptoms at all.
[00:51:28.638 --> 00:51:32.501]  This is a giant attack on Americans, and I think that's the biggest takeaway.
[00:51:32.521 --> 00:51:34.783]  I mean, I had a cold last week.
[00:51:34.823 --> 00:51:35.363]  I had a cold.
[00:51:35.383 --> 00:51:36.965]  I don't have COVID.
[00:51:37.025 --> 00:51:37.725]  Stop saying that.
[00:51:37.785 --> 00:51:41.668]  So I think that's the biggest takeaway, that these are bioweapons from day one.
[00:51:41.748 --> 00:51:48.574]  I've said they're only intended to harm, disable, disfigure, and kill people.
[00:51:49.409 --> 00:51:56.974]  So how is it they can, I mean, this is a bold move to just blatantly promote this vaccine that we now know is deadly.
[00:51:56.994 --> 00:51:58.315]  I mean, we have so much evidence.
[00:51:58.675 --> 00:51:59.936]  It's just ridiculous at this point.
[00:51:59.956 --> 00:52:00.416]  And you know what?
[00:52:00.436 --> 00:52:01.297]  See, look, I'm already guilty.
[00:52:01.317 --> 00:52:02.157]  I'm saying vaccine.
[00:52:02.297 --> 00:52:04.659]  I'm already falling into the trap, like you just said.
[00:52:04.679 --> 00:52:06.220]  I can't even help it.
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:07.921]  My vernacular is I've already been trained.
[00:52:08.161 --> 00:52:10.983]  You know, it's like I'm even a victim of the brainwashing and I know it's going on.
[00:52:11.683 --> 00:52:13.945]  But how can they get away with this?
[00:52:13.965 --> 00:52:16.026]  I mean, this is bigger than New York City.
[00:52:16.067 --> 00:52:17.127]  This is bigger than Dallas.
[00:52:17.147 --> 00:52:17.988]  We have all the data.
[00:52:18.008 --> 00:52:18.668]  We have all the evidence.
[00:52:18.688 --> 00:52:21.571]  I mean, is Pfizer really going to get away with this?
[00:52:23.912 --> 00:52:38.556]   The answer is no, but the way they are getting away with it is our Congress and former presidents, so Obama and Bush Jr., So Obama, Bush Jr.
[00:52:38.576 --> 00:52:48.283]  and our Congress passed into law through the PREP Act, PAUPERS Act, and CURES Act, the ability for basically our government to commit crimes against humanity, against the American people.
[00:52:48.443 --> 00:52:57.550]  And just like they did in Nazi Germany, they delegate the tasks of harming, disabling, and killing people.
[00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:05.435]  To civil servants, so down to police, firefighters, doctors, health care providers, and even school boards.
[00:53:05.455 --> 00:53:21.666]  And they're able to do this because under the PREP Act, it states that you will not be found guilty of willful misconduct, which is that you know what you're doing is wrong, that it is illegal and criminal, that it could, we know that you know that the harm outweighs the benefits.
[00:53:22.759 --> 00:53:40.294]  And you know that you have no factual or legal evidence for moving forward what you're doing and you cannot be charged with a crime because as long as you are following HHS orders or guidelines, which is CDC guidelines, then you get this get out of free jail memo and that's what's happened.
[00:53:41.195 --> 00:53:52.783]   So school boards and mayors and governors have all been assured as long as you follow what we're saying, don't listen to the parents, Don't listen to your patients.
[00:53:53.203 --> 00:54:03.006]  As long as you follow what you're saying and you inject people, you make children wear masks, you cannot be charged civilly or criminally under, as long as there's an emergency declaration.
[00:54:03.506 --> 00:54:05.447]  So that's how they think they can get away with it.
[00:54:05.547 --> 00:54:08.748]  And then if you take a look at the Department of Defense, the U.S.
[00:54:08.788 --> 00:54:11.368]  Army contract with Pfizer, it's disgusting.
[00:54:11.408 --> 00:54:14.849]  Oh, and they actually state, like bullet number five, I have it right over there.
[00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:26.337]   They state to Pfizer, oh, and keep in mind under this contract, You are considered, I forgot what they said, like a delegated personnel.
[00:54:26.718 --> 00:54:28.199]  I can't remember the term right now.
[00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:32.341]  So they gave Pfizer immunity beyond even manufacturing immunity.
[00:54:32.422 --> 00:54:35.744]  They gave them the same immunity that you would give that they gave an individual.
[00:54:36.946 --> 00:54:48.175]  Well, and then Joe Biden, in one of the, I mean, the whole hour of lies in his State of the Union, but one of the big whoppers, he says, gun manufacturers are the only industry in America that can't be sued.
[00:54:48.415 --> 00:54:55.581]  Well, not only is that not true on its face, it's actually the vaccine manufacturers that are the only industry that cannot be sued.
[00:54:55.941 --> 00:54:59.164]  And that's on record as you were just discussing.
[00:54:59.564 --> 00:55:03.187]  But let me, let me try to get a different angle to this.
[00:55:04.494 --> 00:55:10.496]  If Pfizer is making a bioweapon, for whom are they doing it?
[00:55:15.038 --> 00:55:19.620]  The enemies of America and of freedoms around the world.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:36.397]   So that would be, you know, I don't know the exact names, but if you take a look at the World Economic Forum and the organization, specifically actually the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, where, again, Antony Blinken, our Secretary of State, Spoke at it on October 5th of last year.
[00:55:36.877 --> 00:55:42.961]  He said that we are 38 nation strong organization that is against nationalism.
[00:55:43.341 --> 00:55:50.907]  Nationalism is, you know, that's what America's Americans are, uh, to create this, this unified government and they're growing.
[00:55:50.967 --> 00:56:00.754]  So it's that 38 nation state, uh, comprised of, uh, Officials from nations, as well as extremely wealthy individuals.
[00:56:01.014 --> 00:56:06.169]   And the plan is we know is to, um, Depopulate and control the world.
[00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:07.351]  I said this before.
[00:56:07.391 --> 00:56:09.736]  I mean, I feel terrible for the American people.
[00:56:09.776 --> 00:56:11.199]  We've all we're all deceived.
[00:56:11.219 --> 00:56:12.041]  We're all betrayed.
[00:56:12.081 --> 00:56:12.442]  We're all.
[00:56:13.183 --> 00:56:16.925]  Locked in this nightmare and we're trying to get out.
[00:56:17.025 --> 00:56:27.411]  And so we were deeply, deeply betrayed into thinking that these people were trying to help us when they were actually harming us and taking away all of our rights and all of our liberties.
[00:56:27.451 --> 00:56:29.412]  And I'm terribly sorry about that.
[00:56:29.452 --> 00:56:33.614]  But the only way out of it is to speak the truth and to stand up to them.
[00:56:33.734 --> 00:56:35.195]  So I think that's what we need to do.
[00:56:35.235 --> 00:56:38.196]  And I think, you know, you're saying, you know, are they going to get away with it?
[00:56:38.296 --> 00:56:39.197]  I don't believe so.
[00:56:39.837 --> 00:56:41.438]  There's a new marshal in town.
[00:56:41.898 --> 00:56:55.002]  In DC, starting on March 14th, Carl Mateos, who is the CIO, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Information Officer from the U.S.
[00:56:55.042 --> 00:56:59.444]  Marshals, and he is going to take that position at HHS on March 14th.
[00:56:59.904 --> 00:57:05.806]  The FDA, CDC, and NIH all report into HHS, and the U.S.
[00:57:05.846 --> 00:57:14.514]   Marshals are our largest police force Yeah, I mean, if you're trying to get a grip on this, I would view it like there is a corporate world government.
[00:57:14.534 --> 00:57:20.475]  I think we've all now kind of seen how that's working, how it's being laid out, especially post COVID.
[00:57:20.315 --> 00:57:26.153]   government officials are not violating Americans' constitutional rights.
[00:57:26.153 --> 00:57:31.153]   Yeah, I mean, if you're trying to get a grip on this, I would view it like there is a corporate
[00:57:31.153 --> 00:57:34.795]   world government. I think we've all now kind of seen how that's working, how it's being
[00:57:34.795 --> 00:57:41.833]   laid out, especially post-COVID. But essentially, the pharmaceutical industry's role in the
[00:57:41.833 --> 00:57:47.914]   corporate world government is eugenics, is population control. And that's why they're
[00:57:47.914 --> 00:57:49.235]  promoting this vaccine.
[00:57:49.566 --> 00:58:06.086]   And what's incredible to me is, I mean, there's probably never been, again, I just said vaccine, there's probably never been a time that I could recall where there's a product Where a study comes out, says it's deadly, kills thousands of people, and still gets promoted.
[00:58:06.106 --> 00:58:09.409]  I mean, it's not just, it's not just, hey, we're going to keep it on the shelves.
[00:58:09.869 --> 00:58:11.350]  They're still pushing it.
[00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:13.331]  They're still selling it to us.
[00:58:13.792 --> 00:58:16.253]  Ignore the data that just came out with how deadly it is.
[00:58:17.034 --> 00:58:22.518]  Has there ever been a pharmaceutical product that has been linked to so many deaths that they continue to promote?
[00:58:24.306 --> 00:58:24.966]  No, no.
[00:58:25.146 --> 00:58:27.007]  The products would be completely recalled.
[00:58:27.067 --> 00:58:31.329]  Again, under the FDA law, was it 312-241?
[00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:33.450]  I think it is .241.
[00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:44.054]  There would be an immediate stop to the manufacturing and it would all be recalled because they're putting American people at unreasonable risk for harm and death.
[00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:50.596]  It would be recalled and there would be civil and criminal charges brought against these corporations and the individuals at these corporations.
[00:58:52.497 --> 00:58:52.837]  Period.
[00:58:53.786 --> 00:58:54.367]  Yeah, period.
[00:58:54.407 --> 00:59:12.425]  So, but the problem is, I guess, this is the problem, Owen, is on January 27th of 2020, Secretary Azar at HHS made a declaration that the SARS, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was a threat to public health, safety, and national security.
[00:59:12.485 --> 00:59:29.529]   So then they were able to put in These emergency use laws, which allows pharmaceutical companies, manufacturers to produce a product that doesn't go through animal trials, doesn't go through phase one or two trials, doesn't actually doesn't even need to complete it.
[00:59:29.689 --> 00:59:29.969]  Okay?
[00:59:29.989 --> 00:59:36.115]  It allows them to not manufacture products that don't have to adhere to good manufacturing practices.
[00:59:36.155 --> 00:59:39.898]  They can expire the product, you know, and people like, well, there's no expired product.
[00:59:39.918 --> 00:59:40.559]  Yes, there is.
[00:59:40.919 --> 00:59:55.485]  On August 22nd, Marion Gruber from the CBER division of the FDA sent out a letter to healthcare providers and it's posted on the FDA website saying, look, if you have expired product from Pfizer... Hold that thought, we gotta take a break.
[00:59:55.505 --> 00:59:55.985]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:56.405 --> 00:59:58.906]  You know, it's unintentional this song is playing.
[00:59:58.946 --> 01:00:01.568]  I was just thinking in my head, you know, are we at the end of the line here?
[01:00:02.228 --> 01:00:03.808]  Are we reaching the end of the rope here?
[01:00:04.749 --> 01:00:06.610]  And then it's Jim Morrison, end of the line.
[01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:09.851]  We're back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:10.874 --> 01:00:17.016]  My guess is Karen Kingston, Pfizer whistleblower, we're talking about the vaccines, and I know you were getting into something.
[01:00:17.916 --> 01:00:23.378]  You got cut off by the break, but do you feel like we're just reaching the end of the line here, Karen?
[01:00:23.558 --> 01:00:25.759]  I mean, this is just so out of control.
[01:00:26.781 --> 01:00:41.685]  With these non-vaccines, these bioweapons, I mean, the data that's come out now, whether it's what the vaccines are doing inside of the bodies, whether it's the fatality rate of the vaccines, I mean, you just get the feeling we've got to be reaching the end of the line soon if we're not already there.
[01:00:41.705 --> 01:00:44.425]  I mean, how can it get any worse?
[01:00:44.465 --> 01:00:47.866]  I mean, what, are they going to release the next vaccine that's going to kill half the people that take it in an hour?
[01:00:47.946 --> 01:00:51.987]  I mean, do you get the feeling that we're starting to reach the end of the line with all this?
[01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:59.194]  Well, yeah, but I think what I'm seeing happen, though, is that they're throwing us a bone, right?
[01:00:59.214 --> 01:01:00.575]  They're lifting the mask mandates.
[01:01:00.655 --> 01:01:05.619]  I live in California, so this is the most locked down state in the union.
[01:01:05.639 --> 01:01:11.243]  So they're lifting the mask mandates at the schools this week, and they're doing this across the country, OK?
[01:01:11.483 --> 01:01:12.604]  And they're rolling back.
[01:01:13.289 --> 01:01:21.992]  The vaccines and the CDC is now saying, look, you know, you don't necessarily need to do contact tracing anymore.
[01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:34.417]  But while they're doing this, the World Health Organization is moving forward with an international treaty that if there's another pandemic, which they are planning, then every country needs to move in lockstep.
[01:01:34.497 --> 01:01:43.841]   Not that we just didn't because we did, but they need to move in lockstep as far as the rollout of the vaccinations against this The next weaponized virus that they're going to release.
[01:01:44.221 --> 01:01:58.211]  And this is dangerous because Biden also put forward, and I don't know where the plan is and where it stands as far as going into being passed in the House and the Senate, is he put together a COVID-19 responsive plan.
[01:01:58.331 --> 01:02:03.355]  And there's a portion of that that prioritizes vaccinating children.
[01:02:04.364 --> 01:02:11.428]  So if you take a look at the World Health Organization plan, they said it's important that everyone get vaccinated all around the world, especially the children.
[01:02:11.768 --> 01:02:19.712]  So if they declare a vaccination day, if your child's in school by default, they will be injected with these bioweapons.
[01:02:20.172 --> 01:02:28.856]  And I don't know if it's Trump or Blinken that enters into these treaties with the World Health Organization, but make no mistake, they're signing away our constitutional rights.
[01:02:28.876 --> 01:02:29.757]  That is treason.
[01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:40.432]  So they're giving us, we're having breathing room right now just for another attack, you know, in 2024 of 2022.
[01:02:40.553 --> 01:02:42.895]  So this, we need to stop this now.
[01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:50.545]  There are laws in place that allow, quote unquote, allow people to commit crimes against one another here in this country.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:03:00.682]  The reason why I asked you to just bring this up, so if you click on download final guidance for the document and go to page 3, these are the laws that are waived.
[01:03:00.742 --> 01:03:09.204]  Just an example, go to page 3, an example of what people are being injected with and how reckless it was bringing these products to market.
[01:03:09.224 --> 01:03:24.022]   And the reason why, go to page 3, number 3, the reason why That this is so reckless right there those three bullet points I want to highlight empower the FDA to extend expiration date of an eligible FDA approved medical countermeasure.
[01:03:24.767 --> 01:03:27.008]  Plus, I mean, that's like insider trading.
[01:03:26.827 --> 01:03:31.586]   So they can produce these injections prior to getting FDA authorization.
[01:03:31.586 --> 01:03:33.626]  That's why so many were available.
[01:03:33.626 --> 01:03:37.666]   Under normal circumstances, you can't ramp up and start mass production until you get
[01:03:37.666 --> 01:03:39.507]  actual approval from the FDA.
[01:03:39.507 --> 01:03:41.547]  Plus, I mean, that's like insider trading.
[01:03:41.547 --> 01:03:44.108]   It's like, oh, we know we're going to get the approval anyway, so just go ahead and
[01:03:44.108 --> 01:03:45.108]  make them all.
[01:03:45.108 --> 01:03:46.108]  Exactly.
[01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:50.893]  This is how insider trading, this is how crime works, not how our government is supposed to work.
[01:03:51.654 --> 01:03:53.835]  And then they also waive good manufacturing practices.
[01:03:54.095 --> 01:03:59.540]  They allow people who normally, if you go to bullet three, allow emergency dispensing of a medical countermeasure.
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:09.047]  That would be these injections of an actual, CDRN is chemical, biological, radioactive, or nuclear emergency event without requiring an individual prescription for each recipient.
[01:04:09.067 --> 01:04:10.548]  And you don't need to be a qualified individual.
[01:04:10.948 --> 01:04:18.053]  So, I just wanted to show that these were put in place and, you know, it's really important, too, to weigh those good manufacturing processes.
[01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:19.294]  What does that mean?
[01:04:19.535 --> 01:04:21.916]  That means there's no inspection of the sites, okay?
[01:04:22.156 --> 01:04:25.759]  There's no inspection of the supply chain management for quality control.
[01:04:26.159 --> 01:04:33.705]  And so, there's a danger there as far as the quality of the product, the sterility of the product, and the stability of the product.
[01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:38.408]   But more than that, It gives Pfizer and Moderna plausible deniability.
[01:04:38.448 --> 01:04:44.991]  So if they go, wait, we tested your vials and there's graphene oxide in it, and they can go, oh, that must be a supply chain management issue.
[01:04:45.011 --> 01:04:46.151]  You know, we rushed these to market.
[01:04:46.191 --> 01:04:48.813]  We don't know who along the supply chain stuck graphene oxide in there.
[01:04:48.873 --> 01:04:49.853]  Oops, won't happen again.
[01:04:49.973 --> 01:04:57.657]  Or yeah, it's like a contaminant gets into the juice, into the bioweapon, in the process, and they just say, oh, we had nothing to do with it.
[01:04:58.077 --> 01:05:06.717]   But going back to that document for a second, Do you see any significance in the fact that that came out in 2017?
[01:05:06.817 --> 01:05:11.121]  Was there a prior document before that and then they just rewrote it?
[01:05:11.201 --> 01:05:12.883]  Or what's the significance of that date?
[01:05:14.408 --> 01:05:20.030]  It's very significant because on December 13, 2016, Obama passed the Cures Act.
[01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:26.532]  And the Cures Act rewrote much of the PrEP Act and the POPR Act for emergency use authorization products.
[01:05:27.232 --> 01:05:28.413]  So that's really important.
[01:05:28.433 --> 01:05:32.814]  So this was done under Scott Gottlieb's watch, a former FDA commissioner.
[01:05:34.175 --> 01:05:41.522]  And so, yeah, they rewrote the guidelines because they had now more leniency to do whatever they wanted.
[01:05:41.542 --> 01:05:42.923]  So that's why they rewrote the guidelines.
[01:05:43.143 --> 01:05:47.527]  And by the way, because I'm just thinking out loud here, just going back in time.
[01:05:48.628 --> 01:05:58.477]  I mean, that basically when Fauci said there's going to be a pandemic in Trump's presidency, it's like the same day he said that they released that document.
[01:06:00.717 --> 01:06:03.000]  Yeah, probably about the same time.
[01:06:05.282 --> 01:06:06.143]  The document's January 2017.
[01:06:06.183 --> 01:06:10.068]  I'm pretty sure it was Fauci in January 2017 when he said the pandemic is coming.
[01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:11.109]  So they knew it.
[01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:12.631]  I mean, they've been planning this for years.
[01:06:13.232 --> 01:06:14.693]  It was actually February 14th.
[01:06:14.734 --> 01:06:16.616]  It was Valentine's Day, I remember.
[01:06:16.756 --> 01:06:17.997]  Oh, he's so loving.
[01:06:18.037 --> 01:06:20.841]  He's going to hit you with his pandemic because he loves you so much.
[01:06:21.707 --> 01:06:22.087]  Yeah.
[01:06:22.468 --> 01:06:33.116]  So this is, this, that, that document just showed is kind of a summary, the, the cliff notes to all, a lot of the laws that were passed, uh, that allow our government to commit crimes against humanity.
[01:06:33.136 --> 01:06:44.185]  But I have some good news is that the, the, these, the laws that Congress passed and that the, and President Obama signed into law, um, are unconstitutional.
[01:06:44.205 --> 01:06:45.386]  This should have never happened.
[01:06:45.906 --> 01:06:48.690]   So under, U.S.
[01:06:48.710 --> 01:07:00.296]  Title Code 18, Sections 241, which is conspiracy against rights, and Section 242, deprivation of rights under the color of law, so pretending you have authority that you don't have.
[01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:09.661]  If that results in the harm or death of American people, then that's punishable by imprisonment, life imprisonment, or death.
[01:07:10.062 --> 01:07:23.031]   Now, why I'm hopeful is because there was an announcement On Wednesday, I believe, no, on Thursday morning I saw Carl Mateas, who is the Chief Information Officer, as I was saying, at the U.S.
[01:07:23.071 --> 01:07:26.492]  Marshals, is now going to be the Chief Information Officer at HHS.
[01:07:27.373 --> 01:07:37.496]  And I've been saying this since July of last year, if we want this insanity to stop, if we want to start healing our country and regaining our rights under the Constitution, it's a simple answer.
[01:07:39.036 --> 01:07:39.156]  Yeah.
[01:07:38.976 --> 01:07:44.536]   revert, just say there's no longer a threat to public health safety and national security
[01:07:44.536 --> 01:07:48.215]  because of a novel coronavirus and COVID-19.
[01:07:48.215 --> 01:07:52.776]   And then the money runs out, but we can actually restore our country.
[01:07:52.776 --> 01:07:58.096]   And what's interesting is the US Marshals are the strongest police arm of this country.
[01:07:58.079 --> 01:08:05.743]  Their job is to make sure that people are not violating the Constitution or pretending that they have authority that they don't have or committing treason.
[01:08:06.063 --> 01:08:06.904]  That is their job.
[01:08:07.284 --> 01:08:09.345]  And so I find it interesting that the CIO from the U.S.
[01:08:09.405 --> 01:08:16.730]   Marshals is now going to HHS and that the FDA, CDC, and NIH All right, we've got to take a break here.
[01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:33.804]  Let's come back, let's again talk about the significance of what you just talked about there, and then what Americans can do, what congressmen can do to try to stop this, and then I have one question too about the emergency use authorization that I want to get Karen's answer to on the other side.
[01:08:34.446 --> 01:08:36.127]  Last segment here with Karen Kingston.
[01:08:37.067 --> 01:08:51.253]  Karen, so much of what happened with the vaccine rollout, the bioweapon rollout, the death shot, was because of the Emergency Use Authorization, which we've highlighted before here.
[01:08:52.154 --> 01:09:12.373]   Now, correct me if I'm wrong here, they have not pulled the Emergency Use Authorization, which is their legitimate reason for pushing these vaccines out so quickly, these death shots, If the EUA is pulled, would that then pull the shots as well?
[01:09:12.433 --> 01:09:13.995]  Could they no longer dole out these shots?
[01:09:17.625 --> 01:09:18.686]  That's absolutely correct.
[01:09:18.746 --> 01:09:24.431]  The shots would all have to be immediately pulled off the market if the emergency use declaration is recalled.
[01:09:25.032 --> 01:09:40.145]   And if state governors remember that we are a republic and not a democracy, if a state says, look, this virus and viruses that cause this alleged disease of COVID-19 is not a threat to the public, Yes, it does.
[01:09:40.165 --> 01:09:43.827]  If you understand FDA law and approval processes, it makes perfect sense.
[01:09:43.847 --> 01:09:45.608]  Greenwich Bioscience is a great example.
[01:09:45.807 --> 01:09:49.568]   in the state, the mask mandates would also all have to be dropped.
[01:09:49.568 --> 01:09:52.167]  And people think, well, that doesn't make any sense.
[01:09:52.167 --> 01:09:53.167]  Yes, it does.
[01:09:53.167 --> 01:09:56.646]   If you understand FDA law and approval processes, it makes perfect sense.
[01:09:56.646 --> 01:09:58.567]  Greenwich Bioscience is a great example.
[01:09:58.567 --> 01:10:03.728]   They have a prescription cannabinoid for epilepsy for children who suffer 12 or more epileptic
[01:10:03.728 --> 01:10:04.728]  fits a day.
[01:10:04.728 --> 01:10:09.087]   And in some states, cannabinoids, you know, derived from marijuana, are considered a controlled
[01:10:09.899 --> 01:10:15.720]  So when they got FDA approval, they had to go around state by state to actually have it be allowed to be available in that state.
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:20.601]  So you cannot have an unapproved, unauthorized product in your state if there is no emergency.
[01:10:20.661 --> 01:10:22.461]  So that could actually be a way around it as well.
[01:10:22.981 --> 01:10:29.683]  But I think the faster way would be to obviously hold everyone accountable for conspiring to violate our rights.
[01:10:30.123 --> 01:10:31.703]  Does that make sense?
[01:10:32.023 --> 01:10:32.463]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:32.803 --> 01:10:37.326]  But that's what I'm saying is, you know, if we talk solutions here, I'm just trying to find solutions.
[01:10:37.346 --> 01:10:40.847]  I mean, what do you think the American people can do?
[01:10:40.887 --> 01:10:43.889]  I mean, send emails to their senators, their representatives?
[01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:46.710]  I mean, send the data?
[01:10:46.770 --> 01:10:47.871]  I mean, what does Congress need to do?
[01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:48.831]  I mean, what do we need to do here?
[01:10:50.152 --> 01:10:51.732]  Everyone needs to speak out at this point.
[01:10:51.792 --> 01:10:55.254]  I don't know if you noticed, but they're taking a vote count this week.
[01:10:55.674 --> 01:11:00.617]  So first of all, it's really important that Carl Mateas is going to be in HHS on March 14.
[01:11:01.596 --> 01:11:02.758]  This week matters.
[01:11:03.098 --> 01:11:12.549]  So they just in the Senate, you know, had a vote on whether or not they should stop the declaration for the emergency use for the emergency of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19.
[01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:15.433]  And it was a 48 to 47 count.
[01:11:15.953 --> 01:11:22.991]   So when I've been asked at speaking events, You know, what's the way you know if someone is for our country or against our country?
[01:11:23.011 --> 01:11:27.032]  And meanwhile, Karl Schwab has bragged about how he has infiltrated all of these governments.
[01:11:27.052 --> 01:11:29.673]  So there are people that are enemies of America.
[01:11:29.693 --> 01:11:36.776]  I think the number one way to ask them is, will you say SARS-CoV-2 is no longer a threat to public safety?
[01:11:37.176 --> 01:11:44.281]  And national security, because once you say that, that everything, all this control gets lifted and we can start healing America.
[01:11:44.561 --> 01:11:58.951]  Okay, so the money runs out, but the bioweapons are pulled off the market, the mask mandates are, the contact tracing is all removed, everything, everything is removed, but so is the slush fund for this quote unquote COVID-19.
[01:11:59.211 --> 01:12:08.677]   So that's the way out of it, is to, so I would say this week email your governors, say, The virus is no longer, is not a threat to our safety or health.
[01:12:08.737 --> 01:12:09.397]  It never was.
[01:12:09.837 --> 01:12:11.258]  Stop the emergency declaration.
[01:12:11.758 --> 01:12:15.820]  You know, email your senators, email school boards, and say the same thing.
[01:12:15.961 --> 01:12:17.381]  Stop all of these processes.
[01:12:17.421 --> 01:12:24.265]  Stop testing, stop masking, stop contact tracing, because votes are being accounted this week.
[01:12:24.325 --> 01:12:25.145]  I assure you that.
[01:12:26.466 --> 01:12:49.576]  You know, 20, 30 years from now, 40 years from now, you know, if we're still here, if we're still lucky to be here, and I think we will be, you know, your children and your grandchildren are going to ask you, Grandma, Grandpa, what did you do when there were enemies in America attacking children and locking us in our homes and making us wear masks and injecting us with these weaponized injections?
[01:12:49.796 --> 01:12:51.077]  Grandma, Grandpa, what did you do?
[01:12:52.662 --> 01:12:55.804]  Well, and we're pretty much, I would say, already through this.
[01:12:56.225 --> 01:13:00.688]  You know, I mean, Democrats are standing up and cheering when Biden says, oh, we can open the schools back up.
[01:13:00.728 --> 01:13:04.411]  I mean, it's like depending on which day of the week it is, Biden decides if he's going to wear a mask.
[01:13:04.431 --> 01:13:06.712]  So it's like Monday, he's outside on the lawn.
[01:13:06.752 --> 01:13:07.453]  He wears the mask.
[01:13:07.513 --> 01:13:08.774]  Tuesday, he's at the State of the Union.
[01:13:08.794 --> 01:13:09.574]  He doesn't wear the mask.
[01:13:09.835 --> 01:13:10.935]  Wednesday is the mask back on.
[01:13:10.975 --> 01:13:12.036]  Thursday is the masks off.
[01:13:12.456 --> 01:13:12.837]  But I mean.
[01:13:13.337 --> 01:13:16.498]  The sad thing is, there's people that are never going to drop these fears.
[01:13:16.518 --> 01:13:17.378]  They're never going to be the same.
[01:13:17.398 --> 01:13:23.659]  I mean, COVID has done permanent damage to some people's minds, and it's sad, but we have to move on from that.
[01:13:24.259 --> 01:13:26.979]  We have to move on from that, and I think that most of the country already has.
[01:13:27.019 --> 01:13:38.461]  So, I mean, I don't even know what the analogy here is, but it's like, we're going to keep all the fear-mongering, all the theater and everything, even though we all know it's over and we're kind of over it, but we're just going to keep the theater going on.
[01:13:38.641 --> 01:13:42.422]  And I guess that's so that they can keep their Emergency Use Authorization Act in place.
[01:13:43.376 --> 01:13:44.617]  Yeah, they want to keep it in place.
[01:13:44.657 --> 01:13:52.482]  They want to prepare us for the next attack and then for the next release of the next bioweapon injection inoculation.
[01:13:52.522 --> 01:13:56.664]  So we have to stop participating in the program, participating in the lies, period.
[01:13:57.004 --> 01:13:58.705]  And I said, this week matters.
[01:13:59.466 --> 01:14:20.516]   Show up at rallies, show up at school boards, send emails this week and say, stop the declaration that this is a threat and that SARS-CoV-2 or the novel coronavirus And COVID-19 is a threat to our public safety in your city, in your town, in your state, at the federal level.
[01:14:20.576 --> 01:14:21.716]  Start sending emails out.
[01:14:21.796 --> 01:14:24.056]  Go on record about where you stand.
[01:14:24.356 --> 01:14:26.637]  Because I tell you what, I'm in California.
[01:14:26.677 --> 01:14:28.177]  Not everyone is on board with this.
[01:14:28.217 --> 01:14:34.238]  So once this is recalled, what really needs to happen to you as the American people, we don't need new laws.
[01:14:34.498 --> 01:14:37.139]  And we certainly don't need a new plan for the next pandemic.
[01:14:37.199 --> 01:14:38.159]  We do not need that.
[01:14:38.683 --> 01:14:41.705]  This was nothing more than exactly what this says.
[01:14:41.725 --> 01:14:44.046]  It was conspiracy against our rights.
[01:14:44.786 --> 01:14:48.728]  It was a master plan to take away the constitution from the American people.
[01:14:49.709 --> 01:15:03.336]  So what needs to happen is they need a cleaner in DC to go through all the laws on the books that have been put into place over the last 20, 30 years that allow for the deprivation of our rights if there is a pandemic.
[01:15:04.028 --> 01:15:07.752]  You know, and I would go even so far back, or if there's any kind of outside threat.
[01:15:07.772 --> 01:15:12.338]  Because the threat, you know, it's like that horror story we read as kids.
[01:15:12.558 --> 01:15:14.160]  The phone calls are coming from in the house.
[01:15:15.751 --> 01:15:27.637]  So the threats in the house, so we need to go through PAPRA, PrEP, Cures Act, and take anything off the books that allows to experiment on American people, that allows them to take away our rights.
[01:15:27.677 --> 01:15:31.179]  We have to go back to the Patriot Act and take a look at that and clean that up.
[01:15:31.499 --> 01:15:35.161]  You know, just because there's a threat doesn't mean you get to watch me in my house.
[01:15:35.581 --> 01:15:41.511]  So that's what needs to happen is we need, you know, to say there is no longer a threat to national security.
[01:15:41.771 --> 01:15:44.355]  We need patriots to take back our government.
[01:15:44.696 --> 01:15:46.438]  And then we need to clean up the books.
[01:15:46.639 --> 01:15:47.200]  Period.
[01:15:48.482 --> 01:15:50.763]  Yeah, and it's like one of those ridiculous movies.
[01:15:50.843 --> 01:15:52.904]  It's like, you know, Mega Shark versus Mega Croc.
[01:15:52.944 --> 01:15:57.206]  It's like, I don't care if I'm in the middle of a Sharknado, my rights are not suspended.
[01:15:57.867 --> 01:15:58.527]  It doesn't matter.
[01:15:58.587 --> 01:16:00.428]  You can have the worst pandemic of all time.
[01:16:00.488 --> 01:16:04.130]  My rights do not get suspended because you release a bioweapon.
[01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:06.111]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:16:06.711 --> 01:16:08.152]  Karen, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:16:08.192 --> 01:16:08.872]  Yeah, final thoughts.
[01:16:09.782 --> 01:16:12.644]  My final thoughts though is, you know, this isn't people being selfish.
[01:16:12.704 --> 01:16:25.993]  This is saying the American people, they're telling us that we are not intelligent enough, we are not compassionate enough, we are not caring enough, we are not responsible enough to know what to do if our health or our neighbor's health or our child's health is in jeopardy.
[01:16:26.233 --> 01:16:26.914]  That's what they're telling us.
[01:16:26.934 --> 01:16:29.976]  They're telling us we're stupid and they need to make our decisions for us.
[01:16:30.196 --> 01:16:31.117]  And that needs to end.
[01:16:31.417 --> 01:16:32.658]  That absolutely needs to end.
[01:16:32.718 --> 01:16:35.621]  And like I said, this week is the week to speak up and show up.
[01:16:35.681 --> 01:16:43.730]  And even if you've been doing it or if you've never done it before, your children, your grandchildren are going to ask you one day, what did you do during this time period?
[01:16:43.930 --> 01:16:44.931]  So do something.
[01:16:44.951 --> 01:16:46.653]  Because you're going to need an answer.
[01:16:47.814 --> 01:16:48.074]  Wow.
[01:16:48.254 --> 01:16:49.616]  Karen Kingston, thank you so much.
[01:16:49.676 --> 01:16:50.817]  Great stuff as always.
[01:16:50.857 --> 01:16:51.858]  Thank you for joining us today.
[01:16:51.878 --> 01:16:53.340]  Thank you, Owen.
[01:16:53.962 --> 01:17:06.630]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, you know, again, this is why InfoWars needs to be on the air so we can get great guests a platform like Karen to discuss her thoughts and views on all this from an insider perspective with her experience.

[01:17:17.576 --> 01:17:18.217]  You really have.
[01:17:18.277 --> 01:17:19.057]  That's why we're on air.

[01:17:35.342 --> 01:17:37.423]  Get your toothpaste from InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:17:37.703 --> 01:17:40.624]  I'm assuming everybody listening to this right now brushes their teeth.
[01:17:41.084 --> 01:17:42.925]  I'm gonna go ahead and make that assumption.
[01:17:43.165 --> 01:17:45.125]  That everybody tuned in right now brushes their teeth.
[01:17:45.546 --> 01:17:46.306]  At least once a day.
[01:17:47.591 --> 01:17:53.556]  So why not get the toothpaste from InfoWarsTore.com, which, by the way, is great toothpaste.
[01:17:53.896 --> 01:17:54.877]  I love the toothpaste.
[01:17:55.318 --> 01:18:00.082]  Everybody that tries the Super Coral toothpaste from InfoWarsTore.com tells me about how great it is.
[01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:05.026]  So if you're not taking at least that bare minimum step to keep InfoWars on the air, please do so today.
[01:18:05.906 --> 01:18:14.674]  The year is 2022, and you are on the verge of a technocratic corporate world government takeover.
[01:18:16.451 --> 01:18:17.792]  The choice is yours.
[01:18:18.492 --> 01:18:20.594]  Submit or resist.
[01:18:24.456 --> 01:18:31.561]  That is the story, ladies and gentlemen, as we are here with you live.
[01:18:32.637 --> 01:18:34.979]  On the Alex Jones Show, Owen Troyer sitting in for Alex.
[01:18:34.999 --> 01:18:36.481]  I got a couple other guests coming up.
[01:18:36.521 --> 01:18:40.885]  We're going to have the CEO of Odyssey in studio with us just for a short segment.
[01:18:40.905 --> 01:18:41.865]  He just happens to be in town.
[01:18:41.905 --> 01:18:42.846]  I said, hey, pop in.
[01:18:42.866 --> 01:18:43.727]  Just do five minutes with me.
[01:18:44.007 --> 01:18:44.848]  So he's going to be stopping in.
[01:18:45.369 --> 01:18:54.277]  And then Dan Lyman is going to be with me for the entire final hour before the great Jay Dyer takes over on the fourth hour.
[01:18:54.357 --> 01:18:55.618]  I got a ton of video clips.
[01:18:55.698 --> 01:18:57.079]  I got a ton of news in front of me.
[01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:58.901]  I'm not even sure where to begin.
[01:18:59.805 --> 01:19:17.638]  And let me just start with this stack that I didn't get to yesterday, which is really just so key, where... Remember when all the COVID nonsense first started, and they would censor anybody that didn't go along with the official narrative?
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:24.323]  And now, two years later, it turns out that all those people that they censored were right.
[01:19:25.424 --> 01:19:27.526]  Well, see, that's what's so dangerous about censorship.
[01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:32.472]  But of course, it was never about the truth.
[01:19:32.572 --> 01:19:34.113]  It was never about misinformation.
[01:19:34.393 --> 01:19:35.814]  It was always propaganda.
[01:19:35.834 --> 01:19:37.995]  It was always an agenda that they were protecting.
[01:19:38.435 --> 01:20:09.378]   So, when you've got the Surgeon General saying the government needs to act to prevent misinformation on vaccines or COVID, that is a... I mean, the proposal I mean, if you go into practice with this, which they already are doing, but this is the government, this is state-sponsored, state-promoted censorship.
[01:20:09.859 --> 01:20:11.540]  A complete violation of the First Amendment.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:21.507]  So, I mean, Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy needs to be removed right now.
[01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:32.436]   You have promoted Censorship of free speech as a government actor, as the Surgeon General, that's a violation of the First Amendment.
[01:20:32.736 --> 01:20:34.317]  You need to go now.
[01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:41.880]  The Surgeon General should not have another breath as the Surgeon General.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.821]  He should resign if he had any dignity, but no.
[01:20:45.202 --> 01:20:46.642]  He should be removed, he should be fired.
[01:20:46.822 --> 01:20:50.924]  But we're in the clown world now, where poopy pants Joe Biden is the President.
[01:20:52.765 --> 01:20:53.005]  So no.
[01:20:54.557 --> 01:21:04.122]  I call for the Surgeon General to step down immediately for the proposed violation of the First Amendment.
[01:21:05.983 --> 01:21:07.244]  You are the Surgeon General.
[01:21:08.524 --> 01:21:09.745]  This is not North Korea.
[01:21:10.405 --> 01:21:11.606]  You are not a dictator.
[01:21:12.106 --> 01:21:13.247]  And we have rights here.
[01:21:13.987 --> 01:21:15.288]  Kindly step down.
[01:21:16.168 --> 01:21:17.829]  You have violated the First Amendment.
[01:21:19.381 --> 01:21:23.124]  And not only is it a violation of the First Amendment, what you're doing is dangerous.
[01:21:23.444 --> 01:21:26.786]  But he releases this document here.
[01:21:27.647 --> 01:21:29.508]  Oh, I'm the Surgeon General.
[01:21:29.868 --> 01:21:31.309]  I'm the top doctor in America.
[01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:38.815]  I'm not going to tell you about the vaccines killing you because I'm too busy writing up a document about how I want to censor you.
[01:21:40.055 --> 01:21:40.496]  I see.
[01:21:42.355 --> 01:21:43.416]  Very important stuff.
[01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:45.778]  Confronting health misinformation.
[01:21:46.038 --> 01:21:46.539]  The U.S.
[01:21:46.579 --> 01:21:49.942]  Surgeon General's advisory on building a healthy information environment.
[01:21:50.562 --> 01:21:57.488]  Oh, a healthy information environment where they control the narrative and they control what you think and say and see.
[01:21:58.069 --> 01:22:00.171]  Because they're better than you.
[01:22:01.371 --> 01:22:08.734]  And you just don't get a First Amendment anymore because the Constitution is trash, which is a quote from The View this morning.
[01:22:08.774 --> 01:22:12.375]  I mean, folks, coming up in the next hour with Dan, I got unbelievable videos we're going to show you.
[01:22:12.595 --> 01:22:16.676]  No, we have hosts of The View that wear Ukraine shirts.
[01:22:17.296 --> 01:22:22.718]  They have a shirt with the Ukraine flag that says Ukraine, and they say that the Constitution is trash.
[01:22:22.958 --> 01:22:23.578]  How about this?
[01:22:23.979 --> 01:22:24.899]  You're trash!
[01:22:27.392 --> 01:22:27.754]  But hey!
[01:22:28.376 --> 01:22:29.561]  Go over to Ukraine!
[01:22:30.104 --> 01:22:32.654]  I'm sure they have a great constitution over there for ya!
[01:22:34.352 --> 01:22:38.414]  Go, oh you want to fight, you want to fight the big bad Putin.
[01:22:38.654 --> 01:22:45.537]  I'll tell you what, I'll pay for your first class flight right now, I'll buy you body armor and guns and ammunition, whatever you want.
[01:22:46.058 --> 01:22:54.882]  You go over to Ukraine and you enjoy their constitution and you go fight Vladimir Putin because you're so tough and you're so smart and you have the moral high ground.
[01:22:55.182 --> 01:22:55.362]  No.
[01:22:55.942 --> 01:22:59.684]  The Surgeon General needs to be removed immediately.
[01:23:00.925 --> 01:23:03.366]  He's more concerned with censoring free speech than your health.
[01:23:05.669 --> 01:23:14.738]  As they violate the Nuremberg Code, what do you think the Surgeon General thinks about the Pfizer data that came out?
[01:23:14.758 --> 01:23:15.578]  I've got it right here in my hand.
[01:23:15.859 --> 01:23:17.520]  What do you think the Surgeon General thinks about this?
[01:23:17.801 --> 01:23:18.081]  Oh, oh!
[01:23:18.601 --> 01:23:19.742]  I know what he thinks about it!
[01:23:20.043 --> 01:23:21.364]  He's gonna censor it!
[01:23:23.045 --> 01:23:23.466]  Yeah!
[01:23:23.926 --> 01:23:27.910]  He's not gonna comment on the 3% mortality rate.
[01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:28.691]  What'd you say?
[01:23:30.114 --> 01:23:31.055]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:23:31.075 --> 01:23:37.898]  Pfizer did a three-month study, and according to their own data, it's got a higher fatality rate than COVID.
[01:23:39.359 --> 01:23:40.580]  Do you think the U.S.
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:42.181]  Surgeon General will have a comment on that?
[01:23:42.201 --> 01:23:43.241]  Do you think he cares about that?
[01:23:43.541 --> 01:23:46.503]  Do you think he wants you to know about that?
[01:23:47.103 --> 01:23:49.304]  No, no, no.
[01:23:50.045 --> 01:23:53.687]  He wants to make sure that you can't share that study.
[01:23:54.047 --> 01:23:55.788]  He wants to make sure that you don't see this.
[01:23:56.168 --> 01:23:57.869]  Here it is right here, Surgeon General.
[01:23:58.649 --> 01:23:59.350]  Come and get me.
[01:24:00.757 --> 01:24:03.039]  Come and get me, you punk-ass bitch!
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:06.362]  Wants to take Americans' rights of free speech away?
[01:24:08.724 --> 01:24:22.537]  Excuse my language, but, you know, this stuff really angers me, and we're just reaching clown world levels that are so ludicrous at this point, where the Surgeon General is more concerned about censoring your free speech than... What has the Surgeon General ever said about health?
[01:24:22.757 --> 01:24:27.201]  Like, I got this study here, and...
[01:24:29.033 --> 01:24:30.614]  I learned about this in high school.
[01:24:30.754 --> 01:24:34.196]  I had fitness and health classes in high school and I remember.
[01:24:35.256 --> 01:24:42.180]  Stronger muscles, longer life, lifting weights for just 30 minutes a week lowers risk of death from all causes.
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:46.603]  Do you ever hear about exercise from your Surgeon General?
[01:24:46.983 --> 01:24:49.445]  Do you ever hear about vitamins and minerals in the immune system?
[01:24:49.845 --> 01:24:50.205]  No.
[01:24:50.425 --> 01:24:54.828]  You hear about vaccines and masks and censoring misinformation.
[01:24:55.228 --> 01:24:56.269]  Is that misinformation?
[01:24:57.681 --> 01:25:00.743]  Oh, maybe this is misinformation right here.
[01:25:01.483 --> 01:25:14.290]  Maybe my health and fitness courses in high school that told me exercise was good for your heart and can give you a longer, healthier life, maybe that was misinformation.
[01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:21.194]  Maybe this Surgeon General will censor somebody that tells you that exercise is good for your health.
[01:25:22.495 --> 01:25:23.535]  That's misinformation.
[01:25:23.675 --> 01:25:24.756]  I'm the Surgeon General.
[01:25:25.096 --> 01:25:26.357]  I don't talk about health.
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:32.261]  No, I censor free speech now, because I think I'm in North Korea!
[01:25:32.281 --> 01:25:38.483]  Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine goes into liver cells and is converted to DNA.
[01:25:38.523 --> 01:25:40.203]  Yeah, it's rewriting your DNA, folks.
[01:25:41.723 --> 01:25:47.325]  FDA releases thousands of pages of documents related to the experimental COVID vaccine through FOIA requests.
[01:25:47.445 --> 01:25:49.505]  Animal studies show adverse side effects.
[01:25:50.866 --> 01:25:52.026]  Oh, here goes another one.
[01:25:53.999 --> 01:25:58.060]  Katie Meyer, Stanford soccer captain, dies at age 22.
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:00.060]  Cause of death unknown.
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:06.060]  I think we know, don't we?
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.720]  Bye.
[01:26:07.703 --> 01:26:09.384]  I think we know, don't we?
[01:26:12.085 --> 01:26:13.685]  Really just sick stuff, folks.
[01:26:15.126 --> 01:26:18.327]  But see, they want you to live in this clown world scenario.
[01:26:19.647 --> 01:26:21.147]  Exercise isn't good for your health.
[01:26:21.668 --> 01:26:22.948]  All you need is vaccines.
[01:26:23.795 --> 01:26:26.216]  It's like the movie Equilibrium.
[01:26:28.397 --> 01:26:29.217]  What a sad thing.
[01:26:31.458 --> 01:26:34.999]  All these great people just getting murdered by these vaccines.
[01:26:35.019 --> 01:26:36.199]  What a sad state of affairs.
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:57.971]   But it's like the movie Equilibrium, where they force you to take the injection every five hours or whatever it is, and then The lead character, Christian Bale's character, who quits taking the drugs and he walks outside and he experiences life for the first time ever.
[01:27:01.032 --> 01:27:10.114]  But see, they just want to rewrite human anatomy, rewrite human biology, turn it into clown world, globo-homo bullcrap.
[01:27:11.174 --> 01:27:12.014]  And here's another example.
[01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:14.435]  From The Times.
[01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:20.675]  The cult of natural birth is over at long last.
[01:27:20.975 --> 01:27:22.135]  Actually, it's bigger than ever.
[01:27:23.115 --> 01:27:25.396]  And then they promote having a C-section.
[01:27:25.636 --> 01:27:27.776]  Look, some women have to have C-sections.
[01:27:27.796 --> 01:27:39.999]  I'm not demonizing C-sections, but you do understand that C-sections are actually bad for the baby, and you're not getting the right fluids on your skin, and a lot of people have skin problems like eczema and other stuff.
[01:27:41.604 --> 01:27:46.705]  And you know, just in general, probably cutting up a person's body is probably something you want to avoid.
[01:27:46.985 --> 01:27:51.366]  But no, so, it's all about, oh, babies never were born.
[01:27:52.067 --> 01:27:53.527]  Babies were never born.
[01:27:54.947 --> 01:27:57.268]  And then it's, women never had babies.
[01:28:00.849 --> 01:28:04.389]  And then you'll have to get permission to even have a baby.
[01:28:04.930 --> 01:28:21.676]   It'll be like that movie with Ethan Hawke, I forget where it is, what it's called, but you have to get permission to have a baby, and it's grown in a lab, and they just say, oh, someone says, oh, women never had babies, you grow babies in a lab.
[01:28:21.857 --> 01:28:22.377]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:22.938 --> 01:28:28.197]   They want to rewrite the entire human experience so that you can't think, you can't feel,
[01:28:28.197 --> 01:28:32.518]   and they can just dominate you, and then humans in 100 years won't even know
[01:28:32.518 --> 01:28:34.438]  where babies come from.
[01:28:34.438 --> 01:28:46.117]  Two of our best selling products are back in stock.
[01:28:46.117 --> 01:28:49.677]   Themfulwarrestore.com, and they will sell out in the next three, four months
[01:28:49.677 --> 01:28:52.877]   before I get more of the product in if I sell it at full price.
[01:28:53.155 --> 01:28:57.555]   But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting Winter Sun or getting
[01:28:57.555 --> 01:29:01.796]  X3 to try the products and see how amazing they are.
[01:29:01.796 --> 01:29:06.675]   And I believe you will then get hooked on them like myself, my family, and the crew
[01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:07.675]  are.
[01:29:07.675 --> 01:29:11.515]   So again, both these products are back in stock, both X3 and Winter Sun.
[01:29:11.515 --> 01:29:17.354]   They are 50% off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price, I
[01:29:17.354 --> 01:29:20.194]  would estimate, in less than a month.
[01:29:20.194 --> 01:29:24.395]   So this is your chance to get X3 and experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens.
[01:29:24.395 --> 01:29:28.555]   This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune
[01:29:28.555 --> 01:29:29.555]  system as well.
[01:29:29.555 --> 01:29:31.875]  They're amazing and they're at infowarestore.com.
[01:29:31.875 --> 01:29:36.194]  And the reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation.
[01:29:36.194 --> 01:29:38.076]  I need funds to run the operation.
[01:29:38.082 --> 01:29:38.982]  You need to be healthy.
[01:29:39.002 --> 01:29:40.122]  We need to stay on air.
[01:29:40.202 --> 01:29:41.063]  It's a match made in heaven.
[01:29:41.103 --> 01:29:45.904]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're just joined shortly here by Julian Chandra.
[01:29:45.924 --> 01:29:47.484]  He's the CEO and creator of Odyssey.
[01:29:47.504 --> 01:29:49.465]  He just happens to be coming through town.
[01:29:50.505 --> 01:29:52.346]  And he's formerly of TikTok, too.
[01:29:52.486 --> 01:29:56.347]  And so he just wanted to come in today and say, hey, look, we're not censoring free speech on Odyssey.
[01:29:56.407 --> 01:29:57.428]  Infowars is on Odyssey.
[01:29:57.448 --> 01:29:58.528]  They let us live stream there.
[01:29:58.808 --> 01:29:59.648]  We appreciate that.
[01:30:00.308 --> 01:30:01.969]  But really, you see what's going on.
[01:30:02.509 --> 01:30:09.595]  With all of these other news organizations being pulled off because they're called Russian propagandists or whatever, you don't believe that's a good thing?
[01:30:09.695 --> 01:30:11.456]  Odyssey's never going to engage in that censorship?
[01:30:11.476 --> 01:30:11.917]  That's true.
[01:30:12.117 --> 01:30:14.199]  You have to allow for freedom of press.
[01:30:14.619 --> 01:30:23.146]  And you can't make these distinctions between like, oh, this is state media versus public media or billionaire funded media or stuff like that.
[01:30:23.226 --> 01:30:27.910]  So it's a slippery slope if we were to platform any kind of state media.
[01:30:27.930 --> 01:30:32.278]   So we're just going to allow it and let people make their own choices what they want to watch and believe.
[01:30:32.278 --> 01:30:37.997]   Exactly, and any time, I mean I just look at it from this kind of standpoint, any time I'm only allowed
[01:30:37.997 --> 01:30:43.478]   to hear one side of the story, I'm probably being deceived, I'm probably being lied to, there's something else afoot.
[01:30:43.478 --> 01:30:46.917]   And so that's what I see with them just not letting you hear from Putin, not letting you hear from Russia,
[01:30:46.917 --> 01:30:50.556]   even if they're the bad guys, and that's fine, but you should still be allowed to hear from them.
[01:30:50.556 --> 01:30:51.396]  Exactly.
[01:30:51.396 --> 01:30:56.438]   You don't need someone to control what you should be allowed
[01:30:56.438 --> 01:31:00.177]  to read, consume, hear, listen to, et cetera.
[01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:02.281]  That's horrible, in my opinion.
[01:31:02.801 --> 01:31:14.345]  And I think a big part of what we're trying to do with Odyssey is just give agency back to the people, the creators and stuff, where they can create what they want, they don't have to worry about advertisers, etc.
[01:31:14.766 --> 01:31:16.206]  And people can just watch what they want.
[01:31:17.486 --> 01:31:25.049]   We want to revive the original spirit of YouTube, which is about Um, freedom of expression and creativity and those sorts of things.
[01:31:25.449 --> 01:31:27.970]  Is that kind of the thought process that goes into Odyssey?
[01:31:28.190 --> 01:31:30.491]  Is, is replicating what YouTube once was?
[01:31:30.831 --> 01:31:31.512]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:31:31.572 --> 01:31:33.112]  Like, um, I grew up on YouTube.
[01:31:33.473 --> 01:31:35.073]  It's, um, I loved it.
[01:31:35.233 --> 01:31:39.235]  Like, um, you know, the Golden Era, Filthy Frank, and iDubbbz, and all these channels.
[01:31:39.255 --> 01:31:41.676]  And you could find anything and everything, and it wasn't even difficult.
[01:31:41.896 --> 01:31:42.076]  Yeah.
[01:31:42.556 --> 01:31:45.597]  I used to watch, like, Alex's content on, on YouTube all the time.
[01:31:45.977 --> 01:31:50.921]   But now, um, Unfortunately, what we're seeing in the market is YouTube doesn't want to be YouTube anymore.
[01:31:51.402 --> 01:31:57.867]  It's going down this path where it wants to be like... It's more like corporate television now.
[01:31:58.067 --> 01:31:58.527]  Exactly.
[01:31:58.847 --> 01:32:02.170]  And they're prioritizing those types of creators like Trevor Noah, et cetera, and stuff like that.
[01:32:02.490 --> 01:32:03.511]  Nothing against Trevor Noah.
[01:32:03.531 --> 01:32:03.911]  He's great.
[01:32:03.931 --> 01:32:05.052]  Oh, I disagree with that.
[01:32:07.914 --> 01:32:08.995]  That's clearly what they want to do.
[01:32:09.095 --> 01:32:14.438]  And then you have these fly-by-night platforms that come around and they say, oh, we're free speech.
[01:32:14.518 --> 01:32:18.300]  They have all the generic sloganeering you would expect from a new platform.
[01:32:18.781 --> 01:32:20.682]  But they're essentially just political echo chambers.
[01:32:21.102 --> 01:32:25.505]  So you go to those sites that look like FoxTube Online or something like that.
[01:32:25.565 --> 01:32:27.966]  It's exclusively only right-wing content.
[01:32:28.546 --> 01:32:31.108]  So you're not even getting any kind of diversity of opinion there.
[01:32:31.748 --> 01:32:33.169]  And that's all they have to offer.
[01:32:33.449 --> 01:32:36.051]  So with Odyssey, it's just we're trying to build something really generalist.
[01:32:37.370 --> 01:33:00.187]  And you know, there's also something else happening right now, and I don't know if you're playing on Odyssey being a part of this, I'm not sure, and I don't want to tip your hat or anything, but there seems to be this new movement of just people that believe in free speech that don't want to be involved with the corruption and the censorship of Silicon Valley moving to Austin, whether it's Tesla, Joe Rogan, I know Float has moved here, Infowars has been here forever.
[01:33:00.607 --> 01:33:05.250]  I mean, there's this new shift I see happening, and again, I don't know if Odyssey is planning on being a part of this.
[01:33:05.450 --> 01:33:06.271]  Are you guys moving to Austin?
[01:33:07.471 --> 01:33:10.732]  No, we're spread out.
[01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:11.772]  You're everywhere?
[01:33:11.792 --> 01:33:14.073]  Yeah, but I'm in Vegas at the moment.
[01:33:14.493 --> 01:33:15.453]  We're looking at Miami.
[01:33:16.153 --> 01:33:26.916]  Shout out to Mike Solano and Scott Nolan because they kind of spearheaded the whole Silicon Valley movement into Miami as well.
[01:33:27.136 --> 01:33:29.577]  But Austin, I'm not saying it's not on the table.
[01:33:29.597 --> 01:33:29.957]  It could be.
[01:33:30.237 --> 01:33:30.817]  We just have to see.
[01:33:31.365 --> 01:33:38.527]  But what I'm seeing is, and Odyssey is a part of this, it's we're realizing Silicon Valley is not going to work with us.
[01:33:38.627 --> 01:33:42.108]  They're not going to let us have speech, they're going to try to censor us, you know, whatever.
[01:33:42.148 --> 01:33:56.151]  So we have to create our own new hubs and we have to create our own new dynamics with Odyssey, with Rumble, with BandOut Video to say, hey look, there are still going to be free speech platforms, we're not going to operate out of the scum of Silicon Valley, and we're going to create our own economies now.
[01:33:56.491 --> 01:34:05.299]  Yeah, look, the original spirit of Silicon Valley was agency of people, you know, liberalism to, like, say what you want, do what you want.
[01:34:05.359 --> 01:34:06.961]  Social media is about being social, right?
[01:34:08.482 --> 01:34:17.023]   If they're going to revert, sorry, introduce, like, all these new ways of conducting their business.
[01:34:17.023 --> 01:34:21.101]   People will eventually just get tired of it and just leave it up their own accord.
[01:34:21.101 --> 01:34:23.823]   So what we're building is essentially we're just laying the foundation
[01:34:23.823 --> 01:34:25.242]  for everybody to come across.
[01:34:25.242 --> 01:34:27.903]  But we're trying to do it in an non-polarizing way.
[01:34:27.903 --> 01:34:29.063]  Whereby like--
[01:34:29.063 --> 01:34:30.582]  And people have loved Odyssey, folks.
[01:34:30.582 --> 01:34:31.422]  We thank Julian.
[01:34:31.422 --> 01:34:32.702]  He just came in for a quick segment.
[01:34:32.702 --> 01:34:33.903]  He's doing a lot of work here.
[01:34:33.903 --> 01:34:34.742]  We thank you for joining us.
[01:34:34.742 --> 01:34:35.942]  Thank you so much.
[01:34:35.942 --> 01:34:37.822]  Will you have U.S.
[01:34:37.815 --> 01:34:47.499]  Senators in both parties saying we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first, and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before, what do you think that makes the Russians do?
[01:34:47.759 --> 01:34:49.180]  Well, it makes them go into war mode.
[01:34:52.162 --> 01:34:53.643]  So I don't like them invading Ukraine.
[01:34:53.663 --> 01:34:57.066]  I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert.
[01:34:57.486 --> 01:35:01.770]  Only one level above that on their DEFCON, just like our system, and that's fire the weapons.
[01:35:02.731 --> 01:35:09.436]  And so now we have Democrats all over the news saying, let's just use nuclear weapons on Russia.
[01:35:09.817 --> 01:35:11.118]  Think of their ignorance.
[01:35:11.818 --> 01:35:21.080]  Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast with sea-launched missiles that would vaporize our cities within five minutes on average of being launched.
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:25.181]  Sea-launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach 5.
[01:35:25.521 --> 01:35:31.162]  Land-launched systems they can also launch from ships that are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down.
[01:35:31.702 --> 01:35:33.363]  And yes, the United States has those too.
[01:35:34.723 --> 01:35:37.885]  That's a Pentagon lie that Russia developed systems that we don't have.
[01:35:38.285 --> 01:35:39.385]  It's on record the U.S.
[01:35:39.425 --> 01:35:40.626]  has those systems.
[01:35:40.646 --> 01:35:45.688]  The point is it's called mutually assured destruction or MAD for a reason.
[01:35:46.548 --> 01:35:49.790]  Because anyone that would violate the MAD doctrine is insane.
[01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:52.991]  And you know, I'm on the side of not having a nuclear war.
[01:35:53.732 --> 01:35:55.472]  Especially when Russia's not starting a fight with us.
[01:35:55.752 --> 01:36:01.755]  And especially after we just heard for years that everything happening in this country is run by Russia when that was all a giant lie.
[01:36:01.755 --> 01:36:08.755]  the globalists are the outside evil force.
[01:36:08.755 --> 01:36:14.354]   Alright ladies and gentlemen we're back live here in studio and Dan Lyman
[01:36:14.354 --> 01:36:18.515]   now joins me, writer for InfoWars, InfoWars Europe, BorderHawk News
[01:36:18.515 --> 01:36:25.244]   and we're gonna be discussing some the latest news here and I've got some interesting video clips that I think Dan is
[01:36:25.244 --> 01:36:26.994]   going to get a kick out of
[01:36:26.994 --> 01:36:30.728]   from the new I guess you could say the new Trigglypuff.
[01:36:30.968 --> 01:36:38.253]  I mean, just the screaming liberals, just screeching and hemming and hawing to the just blatant theft that goes on.
[01:36:38.333 --> 01:36:46.518]  So now when you go to the store and you can't go get a bottle of shampoo without having to request somebody come unlock it because everybody's stealing, we're going to show you why.
[01:36:46.558 --> 01:36:49.880]  And then the view saying the Constitution is trash.
[01:36:50.801 --> 01:36:51.401]  So that's nice.
[01:36:52.782 --> 01:36:55.145]  Dan, what do you make of the latest breaking news here?
[01:36:55.185 --> 01:37:03.195]  From the vaccines killing people, to the globalists wanting World War III with Russia, to the Surgeon General wanting to censor free speech.
[01:37:03.896 --> 01:37:10.104]  Do you feel like we're getting closer to the end of all this, or do you think we're getting closer to the permanent state of all of this?
[01:37:10.584 --> 01:37:12.065]  It feels more like a permanent state.
[01:37:12.106 --> 01:37:15.869]  It feels like we just cycle from one crisis to the next and the other one hasn't quite finished.
[01:37:15.909 --> 01:37:20.853]  So we're kind of tailing off on that when we started the next one and you do have to wonder what they have in store next.
[01:37:20.973 --> 01:37:38.688]   But yeah, you know, we just saw that we had that video come out today or yesterday of the of the exec at Bayer admitting that basically they had to hoodwink the mass population to taking the mRNA Well, and don't forget, I mean, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, they all said they're never going to take this vaccine because Trump is president.
[01:37:38.768 --> 01:37:40.509]  But then when Biden became president, they loved it.
[01:37:40.529 --> 01:37:41.490]  The vaccine didn't change.
[01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:42.711]  The ingredients didn't change.
[01:37:42.610 --> 01:37:44.451]  They've been able to get many people on board.
[01:37:44.451 --> 01:37:48.930]   Well, and don't forget, I mean, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, they all said they're never going to take this vaccine
[01:37:48.930 --> 01:37:50.050]  because Trump is president.
[01:37:50.050 --> 01:37:52.850]  But then when Biden became president, they loved it.
[01:37:52.850 --> 01:37:53.970]  The vaccine didn't change.
[01:37:53.970 --> 01:37:55.010]  The ingredients didn't change.
[01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:56.289]  That's science.
[01:37:56.289 --> 01:37:58.130]  The science is settled, too.
[01:37:58.332 --> 01:38:05.155]  The science is settled until it's not settled, and the Surgeon General is going to make sure that he censors your free speech in the process.
[01:38:05.455 --> 01:38:06.275]  And it's just amazing.
[01:38:06.335 --> 01:38:10.917]  I mean, we've caught these crooks red-handed.
[01:38:10.997 --> 01:38:11.878]  They've been caught.
[01:38:12.418 --> 01:38:17.520]  It's so pathetic that our government, Democrats, Republicans, whoever, like, it's so pathetic.
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:19.601]  Nobody wants to stop this crime.
[01:38:19.781 --> 01:38:22.462]  Nobody wants to hold the big pharmaceutical companies accountable.
[01:38:22.602 --> 01:38:23.162]  It's like nobody.
[01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:24.000]  No.
[01:38:24.141 --> 01:38:25.943]  And it makes you wonder, really, who is in charge.
[01:38:26.844 --> 01:38:28.045]  Are our officials in charge?
[01:38:28.305 --> 01:38:32.010]  Or is it entities like Big Pharma that are actually the ones that are in charge?
[01:38:32.370 --> 01:38:34.052]  By the way, we have that clip, guys.
[01:38:34.072 --> 01:38:35.073]  Let's go ahead and roll clip 8.
[01:38:35.514 --> 01:38:42.021]  Here's the clip you're talking about with the board member of Bayer basically saying, yeah, we had to deceive people to taking this deadly shot.
[01:38:42.061 --> 01:38:42.322]  Here it is.
[01:38:43.864 --> 01:38:55.366]  We're really taking that leap, us as a company, Bayer, in cell and gene therapy, which to me is one of these examples where really we're going to make a difference, hopefully, moving forward.
[01:38:57.227 --> 01:39:01.948]  Ultimately, the mRNA vaccines are an example for that cell and gene therapy.
[01:39:01.968 --> 01:39:14.971]   I always like to say, if we had surveyed two years ago in the public, would you be willing to take a gene or cell therapy and inject it into your body, We would have probably had a 95% refusal rate.
[01:39:15.131 --> 01:39:23.536]  I think this pandemic has also opened many people's eyes to innovation in a way that was maybe not possible before.
[01:39:24.536 --> 01:39:29.098]  The irony of calling that a World Health Summit, it's a World Death Summit.
[01:39:29.378 --> 01:39:47.865]   But you know, Dan, I remember, and maybe the crew can find some of these stories, remember when it was probably like, I want to say October 2020-ish, Where we were reporting and other outlets were reporting that this was an mRNA technology and they said, no it's not.
[01:39:48.246 --> 01:39:49.487]  There's no mRNA shot.
[01:39:49.528 --> 01:39:50.208]  There's no mRNA.
[01:39:50.228 --> 01:39:51.570]  There's not mRNA in these shots.
[01:39:52.171 --> 01:39:53.633]  Now they just promote it as the mRNA.
[01:39:53.653 --> 01:39:55.875]  It's like they expect us to not have a memory or something.
[01:39:56.336 --> 01:40:01.182]  Yeah, you know I was remembering the other day when they first started talking about the rollout of these injections.
[01:40:01.582 --> 01:40:04.905]  There was so much hype around the temperature that they were going to be stored at.
[01:40:04.985 --> 01:40:07.868]  If you recall, it was going to be negative 40 degrees or something like that.
[01:40:08.369 --> 01:40:18.599]  And they were really hyping that and saying, you know, oh, it's going to be this really stabilized, you know, liquid that's going to be in this really cold, you know, the carry cases and however they move it around.
[01:40:19.179 --> 01:40:23.843]  And then we got, we heard all about that, and that was really to make you feel, oh, comfortable, everything's under control.
[01:40:24.223 --> 01:40:35.532]  And you know, I have friends and medical professionals who have gone in for, unfortunately, for their injections, and they were disturbed at the, at the way that the vials were being handled.
[01:40:36.093 --> 01:40:37.414]  Some of the vials were unlabeled.
[01:40:37.454 --> 01:40:46.001]  They said they were, people were just basically mixing together solutions, and in the back... And they were reporting how, like, they had gotten contaminants in there, and they'd be like, what are these contaminants?
[01:40:46.021 --> 01:40:48.343]  They're like dust and particulate from the air, I guess?
[01:40:48.783 --> 01:40:48.983]  Yeah.
[01:40:49.544 --> 01:40:58.811]  We heard, obviously, in Japan, on multiple occasions, they had to shut down the injection programs in multiple cities because they were finding, like, actual fragments of something in the solutions.
[01:40:58.831 --> 01:40:59.812]  They're like, we don't know what this is.
[01:40:59.832 --> 01:41:00.873]  We're not going to inject it anymore.
[01:41:01.213 --> 01:41:01.433]  Yeah.
[01:41:01.673 --> 01:41:02.674]  So, it really makes you wonder.
[01:41:02.714 --> 01:41:09.800]  I mean, even the quality control, even if you believed in the whole thing, you have to question the quality control, at a very bare minimum.
[01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:12.001]  I mean, the crew is pulling up these stories.
[01:41:12.041 --> 01:41:12.542]  They just had them.
[01:41:12.562 --> 01:41:19.146]  They were saying, it's like, it's like official medical journals and stuff saying, there's no such thing as mRNA technology.
[01:41:19.427 --> 01:41:22.008]  There's no such thing as mRNA in the vaccines.
[01:41:22.449 --> 01:41:25.031]  And now they just say, hey, come get your mRNA vaccine.
[01:41:25.051 --> 01:41:26.371]  I mean, this is torture.
[01:41:26.412 --> 01:41:27.472]  This is gaslighting.
[01:41:30.314 --> 01:41:36.779]  I'm just amazed that, but that's the thing is, should I really be amazed when I watch a group of people in New York yesterday?
[01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:39.862]  Protesting that they want a mask mandate?
[01:41:39.922 --> 01:41:42.904]  Like, should I really be amazed that we're going through this when I have stuff like that going on?
[01:41:43.424 --> 01:41:50.069]  You know, maybe a couple of years ago we might have been shocked, but I think at this point, in clown world, we're... We shouldn't be surprised by anything at this point.
[01:41:50.269 --> 01:41:53.611]  Like, what are they gonna... What are they gonna protest for next?
[01:41:53.852 --> 01:41:55.553]  Just, like, vaccines every day?
[01:41:55.593 --> 01:41:57.694]  Like, I want the vaccine every day!
[01:41:57.714 --> 01:41:59.095]  And I want everybody to get it every day!
[01:41:59.195 --> 01:42:00.316]  I want to live in equilibrium!
[01:42:00.556 --> 01:42:02.017]  By the way, freedom, peace, and love!
[01:42:03.744 --> 01:42:04.525]  It's very bizarre.
[01:42:04.725 --> 01:42:05.325]  Look at these people.
[01:42:05.525 --> 01:42:06.145]  Hey, but you know what?
[01:42:06.185 --> 01:42:06.906]  I give credit.
[01:42:06.946 --> 01:42:08.507]  The one individual is wearing a helmet.
[01:42:09.207 --> 01:42:11.848]  So, I mean, at least that's commitment right there.
[01:42:11.868 --> 01:42:12.609]  You're wearing the mask.
[01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:13.289]  You're wearing the helmet.
[01:42:13.309 --> 01:42:14.590]  Maybe she's got some knee pads, too.
[01:42:15.748 --> 01:42:16.389]  You know what I love?
[01:42:16.409 --> 01:42:22.254]  I've spent a lot of time in Florida in the past month, month and a half, and most of it is pretty functional.
[01:42:22.314 --> 01:42:23.755]  It feels fairly normal.
[01:42:24.236 --> 01:42:28.900]  But Miami is an island of itself, and it's still, you know, totally mask crazy.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:33.043]  And in the state of Florida, you don't have to wear a helmet to ride a motorcycle.
[01:42:33.544 --> 01:42:38.949]  So you have a lot of people riding around Miami on motorcycles and scooters without helmets with their masks on.
[01:42:41.239 --> 01:42:42.560]  I see it all the time.
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:43.320]  Well, it's safety.
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:45.881]  We're stopping a virus.
[01:42:46.141 --> 01:42:48.882]  It's like, you know, I might fall off the bike and die.
[01:42:48.902 --> 01:42:50.962]  I think maybe that's it.
[01:42:51.103 --> 01:42:53.063]  Maybe we should just mandate helmets.
[01:42:53.543 --> 01:42:55.604]  I think everybody should probably wear a helmet all the time.
[01:42:56.264 --> 01:42:57.485]  We don't want you running into things.
[01:42:57.505 --> 01:42:59.605]  You know, you might run into a fence post or something.
[01:42:59.866 --> 01:43:00.466]  We can't have that.
[01:43:01.306 --> 01:43:04.067]  I don't want to... boulders are just falling from the sky!
[01:43:05.027 --> 01:43:06.028]  I gotta wear a helmet now.
[01:43:06.708 --> 01:43:08.608]  Like, maybe that's what we do, is we start trolling the left.
[01:43:08.628 --> 01:43:10.569]  We're like, mandate helmet wearing!
[01:43:10.849 --> 01:43:12.370]  Mandate wearing knee pads!
[01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:13.570]  And they're like, what are you doing?
[01:43:13.610 --> 01:43:14.450]  It's like, what do you mean?
[01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:15.671]  You started this with the masks.
[01:43:15.751 --> 01:43:18.412]  I'm just... I'm just going full... I'm going full-on with it now.
[01:43:18.472 --> 01:43:27.775]  I guess it's not that far of a leap from basically, you know, ordering children under desks not too long ago during the last, you know, Red Scare, so... But, um...
[01:43:28.996 --> 01:43:34.058]  FEMA wants you to know that if there's a nuclear explosion in your house, that just make sure you wear a mask.
[01:43:34.078 --> 01:43:34.739]  Alright?
[01:43:35.179 --> 01:43:41.462]  Because the nuclear bomb is just gonna completely obliterate you, but we want you to go to the grave with the mask.
[01:43:41.742 --> 01:43:52.486]   Well, if you recall, not too long ago when there was a hurricane bearing down on Louisiana, FEMA and the governor of Louisiana told everyone that part of hurricane preparedness was to go and get your injections.
[01:43:53.967 --> 01:43:57.188]  Well they said, they said the vaccine stops you from, it stops everything.
[01:43:57.228 --> 01:43:58.248]  It's a magical vaccine.
[01:43:58.268 --> 01:43:59.709]  It stops you from even dying or anything.
[01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:00.729]  Prevents death.
[01:44:01.309 --> 01:44:06.632]  They did say that the all-case cause of death lowered if you took the injection.
[01:44:06.652 --> 01:44:12.196]  Yeah, they're like, okay, well, sure the vaccine doesn't stop you from getting COVID, but it stops everything else!
[01:44:12.956 --> 01:44:13.657]  Anything else!
[01:44:13.697 --> 01:44:15.298]  Like, please, just take the shot!
[01:44:15.398 --> 01:44:17.879]  It's just, it's so great, and I'm begging you to take it!
[01:44:17.899 --> 01:44:19.861]  All right, when we come back, we're gonna watch people...
[01:44:20.701 --> 01:44:23.983]  I mean, they just rob in daylight now.
[01:44:24.023 --> 01:44:29.046]  We've got crazy leftists, and you're not going to believe, or maybe you will, what was said on The View this morning.
[01:44:29.126 --> 01:44:30.767]  It's a total hack show.
[01:44:30.947 --> 01:44:32.047]  We'll be right back with Dan Lyman.
[01:44:32.868 --> 01:44:34.289]  We've got Dan Lyman in studio here.
[01:44:34.349 --> 01:44:35.229]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:44:35.269 --> 01:44:36.370]  Owen Schroer sitting in.
[01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:38.791]  Alex will be back.
[01:44:39.311 --> 01:44:42.493]  In fact, I think he's planning an emergency broadcast for tomorrow.
[01:44:42.553 --> 01:44:45.595]  It's like he's going to land and then probably come right into studio and start working again.
[01:44:46.375 --> 01:44:48.396]  And then we'll be back Sunday Night Live as well.
[01:44:48.896 --> 01:44:53.138]  But folks, everything we do here is made possible by your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:53.479 --> 01:44:54.559]  The supplements are great.
[01:44:55.099 --> 01:44:58.861]  The hats, the t-shirts, the toothpaste, the air filters, the water filters.
[01:44:59.381 --> 01:45:01.542]  I am a big fan of the air filters.
[01:45:01.562 --> 01:45:02.863]  I actually have three in my house.
[01:45:03.703 --> 01:45:04.944]  I've got two of the water filters.
[01:45:05.284 --> 01:45:07.805]  If you're not filtering your water, you're just crazy at this point.
[01:45:08.386 --> 01:45:09.546]  You're just absolutely crazy.
[01:45:09.586 --> 01:45:13.028]  I mean, I could sit here and just read off all these different stories.
[01:45:14.368 --> 01:45:26.006]   Like, they were pouring They were pouring, I forget what the name of it is, but it's like the juice, like the liquid juice from dead people into public water supplies here in Austin.
[01:45:27.912 --> 01:45:29.112]  You're like, what?
[01:45:29.793 --> 01:45:32.433]  Yeah, that's what they're doing to the water supply.
[01:45:32.974 --> 01:45:37.335]  Why would you not filter your water with a water filter from InfowarsStore.com?
[01:45:37.615 --> 01:45:39.055]  If you haven't done that, I would do that now.
[01:45:39.536 --> 01:45:44.457]  Plus the storable foods and all the other emergency and preparedness gear that is at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:45:44.677 --> 01:45:48.178]  And we've got big sales going on right now, like 50% off Winter Sun Plus.

[01:45:54.383 --> 01:45:57.687]  It's all at Infowarsstore.com and your support there keeps us on the air.
[01:45:58.187 --> 01:46:05.155]  Alright, let's play this clip that maybe isn't so shocking from The View and we'll get Dan Lyman's response.
[01:46:05.295 --> 01:46:08.538]  So this is, I mean, The View is the biggest joke in the history of television.
[01:46:09.539 --> 01:46:11.301]  They don't have a combined IQ of 5.
[01:46:13.546 --> 01:46:17.128]  If you combine all the hosts IQ, Joy Behar fell flat on her face yesterday.
[01:46:17.969 --> 01:46:25.033]  They promote vaccines and then get sick and then they do the theater like, oh, I just tested positive for COVID so I'm going to walk off the set now because that that makes sense.
[01:46:25.454 --> 01:46:28.576]  But here's the latest insanity from The View today.
[01:46:28.656 --> 01:46:29.316]  Check this one out.
[01:46:30.737 --> 01:46:35.080]  Some will say, OK, so are you arguing for throwing out the Constitution?
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:36.681]  Should the Constitution be thrown out?
[01:46:36.761 --> 01:46:37.221]  What do we do?
[01:46:37.501 --> 01:46:38.582]  Is it a living document?
[01:46:38.662 --> 01:46:40.503]  Is it a or is it a sacred document?
[01:46:40.603 --> 01:46:41.824]  It's certainly not sacred.
[01:46:43.074 --> 01:46:45.074]  The Constitution is kind of trash.
[01:46:45.074 --> 01:46:47.074]  Let's just talk as adults first.
[01:46:47.074 --> 01:46:49.074]  What did you say? It's what?
[01:46:49.074 --> 01:46:51.074]  It's kind of trash.
[01:46:51.074 --> 01:46:55.074]   It was written by slavers and colonists and white people who were willing to make deals
[01:46:55.074 --> 01:46:57.074]  with slavers and colonists.
[01:46:57.074 --> 01:46:59.074]   They didn't ask anybody who looked like me what they thought about the Constitution.
[01:46:59.074 --> 01:47:03.074]   So the Constitution is trash and nobody on the view
[01:47:03.074 --> 01:47:07.074]   I mean even Joy Behar for a second was like, wait
[01:47:07.074 --> 01:47:09.074]  the Constitution is trash?
[01:47:08.655 --> 01:47:13.016]  So I mean, what could The View say next that could really tell you who they are?
[01:47:13.036 --> 01:47:13.976]  I mean, what are they going to say next?
[01:47:17.617 --> 01:47:18.017]  Look at this.
[01:47:18.597 --> 01:47:19.738]  Who is this guy anyway?
[01:47:20.398 --> 01:47:21.118]  L-E-N-Y-C?
[01:47:22.776 --> 01:47:25.579]  But see, oh, she sits on there with a Ukraine shirt.
[01:47:26.039 --> 01:47:28.101]  I think, Dan, I think they should go to Ukraine.
[01:47:28.201 --> 01:47:30.223]  I hear they have a nice constitution over there in Ukraine.
[01:47:30.344 --> 01:47:31.345]  Oh, I'm totally fine with it.
[01:47:31.445 --> 01:47:34.468]  We should forcibly deport them to Ukraine.
[01:47:34.988 --> 01:47:38.071]  They can take their whole, they can take the view desk, they can take the whole crew, everything.
[01:47:38.191 --> 01:47:39.453]  Yeah, if they have a problem with the U.S.
[01:47:39.493 --> 01:47:41.335]  Constitution, then they can go live elsewhere.
[01:47:41.355 --> 01:47:42.636]  There's a lot of other countries in this world.
[01:47:42.856 --> 01:47:43.977]  I mean, they are free to leave.
[01:47:44.037 --> 01:47:45.157]  I don't think anyone's keeping them here.
[01:47:45.298 --> 01:47:45.878]  No, for sure.
[01:47:46.018 --> 01:47:51.081]  It's not Canada where Canadians are actually not free to leave if they don't have the proper injections.
[01:47:51.581 --> 01:47:52.662]  I would gladly trade.
[01:47:52.962 --> 01:47:54.543]  I want to propose a trade right now.
[01:47:55.344 --> 01:47:59.286]  Let's trade the entire cast of The View for Vladimir Putin.
[01:48:00.047 --> 01:48:00.787]  Would you accept that?
[01:48:00.907 --> 01:48:01.468]  I'm fine with it.
[01:48:01.628 --> 01:48:02.348]  You'd take that trade?
[01:48:02.468 --> 01:48:02.708]  Certainly.
[01:48:02.828 --> 01:48:03.429]  What about you guys?
[01:48:03.449 --> 01:48:04.409]  Do you guys like that trade?
[01:48:05.250 --> 01:48:06.731]  Whole cast of The View for Putin?
[01:48:08.635 --> 01:48:09.515]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:48:10.116 --> 01:48:12.337]  I don't see Vladimir Putin calling the U.S.
[01:48:12.357 --> 01:48:13.257]  Constitution trash.
[01:48:14.417 --> 01:48:15.318]  I don't see that happening.
[01:48:16.078 --> 01:48:20.240]  I don't see him, oh look, I'm virtue signaling for Ukraine, oh my gosh.
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:25.422]  Okay, go pick up a gun, go put your helmet on, and you go kill Putin.
[01:48:25.462 --> 01:48:27.663]  Lindsey Graham and Sean Hannity will be right beside you.
[01:48:28.363 --> 01:48:29.164]  They're ready to go.
[01:48:29.424 --> 01:48:30.724]  Isn't it so sick though, Dan?
[01:48:30.744 --> 01:48:35.146]  I mean, we're not surprised by Lindsey Graham and Sean Hannity, but it's just so sick.
[01:48:35.166 --> 01:48:37.007]  They've never seen a war they didn't want you to die in.
[01:48:37.467 --> 01:48:42.229]  No, I think we should be really cautious how we are viewing this entire thing.
[01:48:42.289 --> 01:48:53.273]  When Sean Hannity and The View are on the same side, that should raise some red flags and we should say, you know what, maybe we should really try to understand more about what's going on before we jump to any conclusions.
[01:48:53.333 --> 01:48:56.274]  Well hey now, Marina Abramovich stands with Ukraine.
[01:48:57.035 --> 01:48:57.675]  Is she Ukrainian?
[01:48:58.910 --> 01:49:00.291]  I don't know, but she stands with Ukraine.
[01:49:00.871 --> 01:49:04.212]  She wants you to know that she stands with Ukraine and so you should too.
[01:49:05.072 --> 01:49:10.213]  And they're going to be doing spirit cookings now in honor of Ukraine.
[01:49:10.394 --> 01:49:13.835]  And death black magic to try to take Putin out.
[01:49:13.895 --> 01:49:19.616]  Abramovich is probably doing a spirit cooking right now to get Putin out of Russia.
[01:49:20.417 --> 01:49:21.637]  I mean, doesn't that tell you something though?
[01:49:22.816 --> 01:49:24.179]  Putin may be a really bad guy.
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:26.024]  The globalists want him dead.
[01:49:26.144 --> 01:49:27.788]  I mean, they want to Gaddafi Putin.
[01:49:27.808 --> 01:49:29.112]  That's what I think they're going to try to do.
[01:49:29.713 --> 01:49:41.376]  Well, I think, not necessarily that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, but I'm definitely, probably more closely sympathetic to whoever Maria Abramovich is opposed to.
[01:49:41.756 --> 01:49:46.057]  At least, if I had to pick one side or the other, I'm probably going to lean the other way, just out of principle.
[01:49:46.297 --> 01:49:53.459]  Oh, so wait, you're telling me the woman that does the weird blood rituals and the satanic rituals, you're a little turned off by that?
[01:49:53.519 --> 01:49:54.339]  Yeah, probably not.
[01:49:54.359 --> 01:49:55.499]  You don't like the Satan worshippers?
[01:49:55.740 --> 01:49:57.140]  Probably not agreeing on too much with her.
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:02.242]  I mean, that thing looks like it just rose from the crypt.
[01:50:03.642 --> 01:50:05.383]  I mean, that looks like a demon right there.
[01:50:06.743 --> 01:50:07.263]  And then what was it?
[01:50:07.323 --> 01:50:11.125]  Bill Gates did the thing where like she was the first virtual... Do you know what I'm talking about?
[01:50:11.821 --> 01:50:18.526]  It was like they did the first like virtual thing with the headsets and like it was Marina Abramovich like, you are in the Microsoft world now.
[01:50:18.847 --> 01:50:19.767]  Thank you, Bill Gates.
[01:50:20.468 --> 01:50:23.250]  And she's like, so she's like the first virtual woman ever or something.
[01:50:23.730 --> 01:50:26.272]  She's gonna be the most powerful witch in the metaverse.
[01:50:27.073 --> 01:50:27.813]  Oh my gosh.
[01:50:28.354 --> 01:50:28.734]  Here we go.
[01:50:28.774 --> 01:50:31.596]  Speaking of witches, guys, this is just...
[01:50:32.799 --> 01:50:33.879]  This is just fantastic.
[01:50:33.899 --> 01:50:34.680]  I mean, let's just be honest.
[01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:35.640]  Look at this.
[01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:37.301]  Look, this is the new Trigglypuff.
[01:50:38.421 --> 01:50:43.263]  This is the pro-pedophile, pro-trans kids left.
[01:50:44.243 --> 01:50:45.524]  They just keep giving us the gold.
[01:50:45.544 --> 01:50:47.384]  I mean, these people are mentally ill.
[01:50:47.424 --> 01:50:48.745]  Here's your latest evidence in Clip 13.
[01:50:48.605 --> 01:51:03.405]  clip 13.
[01:51:03.192 --> 01:51:13.192]  [INAUDIBLE]
[01:51:13.192 --> 01:51:16.711]  Wow, what do you think about that?
[01:51:16.841 --> 01:51:19.582]  You remember when Abe Skrillex, uh, you know Abe Skrillex.
[01:51:19.602 --> 01:51:20.543]  Oh, like yesterday.
[01:51:20.803 --> 01:51:22.905]  But at the time, he was such a novel thing.
[01:51:22.945 --> 01:51:26.267]  He was this very unique, we said, wow, we haven't seen one of these out in the wild yet.
[01:51:26.367 --> 01:51:27.327]  And it was this new thing.
[01:51:27.768 --> 01:51:32.927]   And it looks like there's like this whole group of AIDS Skrillex that are just running wild now
[01:51:32.927 --> 01:51:33.768]  all over the place.
[01:51:33.768 --> 01:51:36.927]  Yeah, that's like the female AIDS Skrillex.
[01:51:36.927 --> 01:51:37.768]  Yeah.
[01:51:37.768 --> 01:51:40.068]  I mean, just the whole look of this individual.
[01:51:40.068 --> 01:51:46.047]   This is, see, this is what the globo homos have done to people, though, you know?
[01:51:46.047 --> 01:51:47.287]  That's what's so sad about this.
[01:51:47.287 --> 01:51:53.007]   This is what the globo homos have done to people, and they're just gone.
[01:51:53.007 --> 01:51:56.927]   I recommend if the crew wants to go onto the libs of TikTok, Twitter, most recently,
[01:51:56.927 --> 01:52:00.688]   They have another very similar video of two creatures like that barking at each other
[01:52:00.688 --> 01:52:01.806]  in the back of a car.
[01:52:01.775 --> 01:52:04.136]  That's another gem.
[01:52:04.356 --> 01:52:04.737]  Guys.
[01:52:05.777 --> 01:52:06.137]  Guys.
[01:52:06.298 --> 01:52:09.299]  Libs of TikTok is one of the best things to ever happen to the internet.
[01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:11.581]  I'm surprised they still let it operate.
[01:52:11.761 --> 01:52:11.961]  Yeah.
[01:52:12.061 --> 01:52:14.722]  It's got, I mean, it's, but they're proud of it.
[01:52:14.782 --> 01:52:19.105]  Like she probably looks at that video like, yeah, I stuck it to that transphobia.
[01:52:20.322 --> 01:52:22.223]  With my big fat gut hanging out?
[01:52:22.263 --> 01:52:22.763]  Yeah!
[01:52:22.783 --> 01:52:24.904]  I mean, look at that thing!
[01:52:26.345 --> 01:52:27.406]  Oh my gosh!
[01:52:27.786 --> 01:52:28.666]  I don't know if I can do it.
[01:52:29.206 --> 01:52:35.950]  Guys... If you see this video of these two people barking at one another... I mean, what the hell is going on in this planet?
[01:52:35.970 --> 01:52:37.150]  Alright, we may have to show it.
[01:52:37.531 --> 01:52:37.831]  And then, uh...
[01:52:38.795 --> 01:52:41.497]  Folks, if you're hungry, you just can go rob Walgreens, okay?
[01:52:41.577 --> 01:52:45.580]  Just in case you wanted to know if you need some shampoo or some soap or maybe you want a candy bar.
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:47.141]  Just go rob Walgreens now.
[01:52:47.781 --> 01:52:48.722]  Oh my gosh.
[01:52:49.182 --> 01:52:49.562]  Oh no.
[01:52:50.383 --> 01:52:50.783]  Oh no.
[01:52:50.803 --> 01:52:53.985]  Alright, we're living in serious times here.
[01:52:55.506 --> 01:52:58.608]  We're just trying to lighten the mood with a little humor.
[01:52:58.628 --> 01:52:59.909]  But you know, here's the connection.
[01:53:01.952 --> 01:53:12.358]  These fools that run around acting like jackasses and clowns as like some sort of weird social gimmick, these are the people that are going to get us into World War III.
[01:53:13.444 --> 01:53:15.985]  Because that's where the public support for this crap comes from.
[01:53:16.005 --> 01:53:18.125]  It's from these ignoramuses.
[01:53:18.925 --> 01:53:25.427]  And that's what... See, if these libs would just leave us alone and they can go out and do all their weird, kinky bullcrap, that'd be one thing.
[01:53:25.827 --> 01:53:28.608]  No, they fall for all the propaganda crap.
[01:53:28.888 --> 01:53:30.188]  They vote us into tyranny.
[01:53:30.808 --> 01:53:33.469]  They support all our rights being taken away.
[01:53:33.509 --> 01:53:34.389]  That's the problem here.
[01:53:34.489 --> 01:53:35.749]  I'm all about live and let live.
[01:53:36.110 --> 01:53:37.350]  These people won't let us live.
[01:53:38.351 --> 01:53:41.032]  And mental illness is rampant.
[01:53:41.072 --> 01:53:45.514]  I mean, I just see it as I'm, you know, walking around now spending more time in the U.S.
[01:53:46.195 --> 01:53:48.075]  It's crazy out there.
[01:53:48.175 --> 01:53:50.176]  People yelling strange things at you.
[01:53:50.196 --> 01:53:54.178]  I had a woman yelling at me while I was sitting at a red light the other day.
[01:53:54.198 --> 01:53:55.459]  She's going, it's green, it's green.
[01:53:55.479 --> 01:53:59.120]  And she was standing next to my car and I was looking at her and she was looking very normal.
[01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:02.542]  Otherwise, mental illness is a serious issue right now.
[01:54:02.602 --> 01:54:07.104]  And I think that the whole COVID situation the last couple of years has really amplified the whole thing.
[01:54:07.584 --> 01:54:11.207]  It definitely, you know, it definitely put gasoline on the fire.
[01:54:11.467 --> 01:54:13.469]  Where's the Surgeon General on the mass mental illness?
[01:54:13.749 --> 01:54:15.811]  Alright, like, like, here's some of these videos, folks.
[01:54:15.951 --> 01:54:17.712]  I mean, it is funny.
[01:54:17.892 --> 01:54:18.773]  It's also sad.
[01:54:18.833 --> 01:54:25.919]  These people are a victim of a psychological weapon that's destroyed them, and chemical weapons, and the food and the water that has destroyed them.
[01:54:26.419 --> 01:54:33.523]   And so, Part of me feels bad, but then the other part of me is like, you know what, they hate my guts, they want me dead, so maybe I shouldn't feel so bad.
[01:54:34.424 --> 01:54:36.345]  Let's go to the two barking in the car.
[01:54:36.805 --> 01:54:41.627]  This is the type of crazed behavior that radical leftists are engaged in.
[01:54:41.447 --> 01:54:48.447]   in. Folks, I'm sorry to do this to you, but we had to watch it, so check this out.
[01:54:48.447 --> 01:55:02.686]  And you notice that, like, it's all about ugliness, right?
[01:55:02.655 --> 01:55:04.057]  It's all about, how can I be ugly?
[01:55:04.117 --> 01:55:07.220]  How can I destroy God's temple of the human body?
[01:55:07.301 --> 01:55:08.222]  It's the same thing.
[01:55:08.662 --> 01:55:09.764]  They all think they look different.
[01:55:09.784 --> 01:55:10.485]  They all look the same.
[01:55:11.505 --> 01:55:14.987]  It's a worship at the altar of ugliness.
[01:55:15.187 --> 01:55:18.989]  Everything has to be dissonant, even when they wear expensive clothing.
[01:55:19.129 --> 01:55:19.809]  Some of them do.
[01:55:20.590 --> 01:55:25.772]  It has to be the absolute most mismatched, ugliest stuff that you can put together.
[01:55:27.013 --> 01:55:33.136]  I was jogging and I decided to cut through a college campus, actually a large university down in Florida.
[01:55:33.776 --> 01:55:36.297]  And got to see a lot of the students in their element.
[01:55:36.538 --> 01:55:43.701]  And you know, college kids are not known necessarily for dressing well, and that's totally fine, but the ugliness was, it really struck me.
[01:55:43.781 --> 01:55:53.647]  It's this Gen Z is, it just, they're seeking ugliness and they're really pushing the boundaries of how bad they can look on purpose intentionally.
[01:55:54.547 --> 01:55:55.968]  Oh my, what is that?
[01:55:57.722 --> 01:55:57.942]  What?
[01:55:58.262 --> 01:55:59.883]  Where do you guys find this stuff?
[01:56:00.503 --> 01:56:01.083]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:56:01.103 --> 01:56:04.604]  Can you imagine if you ran the libs of TikTok account?
[01:56:04.864 --> 01:56:10.406]  Can you imagine the stuff that she has to she has to pile drive through just to find that content?
[01:56:10.586 --> 01:56:12.666]  Maybe the stuff that isn't even appropriate for Twitter.
[01:56:12.686 --> 01:56:14.687]  I mean, the horror shows that she has to see.
[01:56:15.047 --> 01:56:16.407]  But, you know, I have to give her so much credit.
[01:56:16.427 --> 01:56:17.648]  She's actually getting results.
[01:56:17.688 --> 01:56:22.629]  We're seeing, you know, professors and teachers actually being suspended or fired due to what she exposes.
[01:56:22.689 --> 01:56:29.270]   But what's amazing is not only are these people derange but they advertise their derangedness on their
[01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.949]  social media.
[01:56:29.949 --> 01:56:34.629]   They film themselves saying really disturbing things and they're not worried about any consequences.
[01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:36.750]  They have no shame whatsoever.
[01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:45.590]   Yeah that's their offense is being as disgusting and grotesque as possible.
[01:56:45.590 --> 01:56:47.670]   Because really to me I don't even think they do it for themselves.
[01:56:47.965 --> 01:56:49.846]  I think they do it because they want to offend.
[01:56:50.106 --> 01:56:56.729]  Like, they want to walk around and offend people and be shocking and abhorrent just to get a response, just to get attention almost, and offend you.
[01:56:56.949 --> 01:56:57.129]  Yeah.
[01:56:57.771 --> 01:56:59.914]  The way they smell, the way they look, the things they say.
[01:57:00.554 --> 01:57:05.520]  But that's the problem is, you talk about going through the college campus, they promote all of this.
[01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:06.401]  Like, they get promoted.
[01:57:06.461 --> 01:57:08.303]  Oh, guys should wear dresses.
[01:57:08.383 --> 01:57:09.805]  Oh, girls should have armpit hair.
[01:57:09.865 --> 01:57:11.366]  Girls should shave their heads bald.
[01:57:11.827 --> 01:57:13.689]  And it's like, hey, do whatever you want.
[01:57:13.709 --> 01:57:16.772]  I don't really care, but let's stop acting like that's attractive.
[01:57:16.792 --> 01:57:18.935]  Let's stop acting like that's what people want to see.
[01:57:19.255 --> 01:57:26.097]  That's what they're elevating now, even with the new models that they push on us in the fashion magazines and in the advertisements.
[01:57:26.797 --> 01:57:28.517]  How fat can we go?
[01:57:28.857 --> 01:57:30.498]  What's the fattest person we can feature?
[01:57:30.578 --> 01:57:31.758]  This woman had to be 800 pounds.
[01:57:31.938 --> 01:57:36.938]  I saw, I can't, this woman had to be 800 pounds.
[01:57:36.938 --> 01:57:40.818]  I mean, it's like she ate Lizzo.
[01:57:40.818 --> 01:57:42.677]  And she's trying to be a fashion model.
[01:57:42.677 --> 01:57:46.277]   And I mean, how do you even put clothes on a beast like that?
[01:57:46.207 --> 01:57:48.367]  Like, how do they even make clothing for something like that?
[01:57:48.407 --> 01:57:49.368]  It's like Jabba the Hutt!
[01:57:49.768 --> 01:57:56.810]  Yeah, we're supposed to be concerned about sustainability, and then we have to be making these outfits that require three times the amount of... Yeah, think about the textiles!
[01:57:56.990 --> 01:57:57.170]  Yeah.
[01:57:57.270 --> 01:58:04.172]  Think about the carbon that is used just to make the textiles for these massive beasts of humanity!
[01:58:04.413 --> 01:58:05.613]  And the fuel that they consume.
[01:58:06.577 --> 01:58:07.598]  Oh, alright.
[01:58:08.219 --> 01:58:11.683]  Let's go to a different angle of this insanity though.
[01:58:11.723 --> 01:58:13.745]  This is going on in a Walgreens.
[01:58:13.785 --> 01:58:24.276]  In fact, I don't know if these are three separate occasions or all the same occasion, but it's broad daylight, a man walks into Walgreens with a backpack, and I mean, he just starts filling his bag.
[01:58:24.556 --> 01:58:25.657]  Here guys, let's start with clip 17.
[01:58:25.717 --> 01:58:27.559]  Go ahead and roll clip 17 here.
[01:58:29.930 --> 01:58:36.254]  Oh yeah, you'd think he's going to jail, but he's not.
[01:58:36.074 --> 01:58:52.433]   not. So this is in Miami here. The individual goes in with a backpack and steals, just fills
[01:58:52.433 --> 01:58:59.154]   it with cosmetic products, hair products and everything. So now, so here's the situation
[01:58:59.154 --> 01:59:00.474]  Dan. You go out.
[01:59:00.474 --> 01:59:01.314]  Bye.
[01:59:01.610 --> 01:59:01.970]  Whatever.
[01:59:02.091 --> 01:59:03.812]  Grocery shopping, retail shopping, whatever.
[01:59:04.193 --> 01:59:06.595]  And, oh, hey, I'm gonna go get some shampoo.
[01:59:06.615 --> 01:59:07.696]  I'm gonna go get some body wash.
[01:59:07.716 --> 01:59:08.937]  I'm gonna go get some lotion or whatever.
[01:59:09.117 --> 01:59:09.237]  Oh!
[01:59:09.858 --> 01:59:11.440]  It's behind a locked door!
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:12.861]  And now you can't get it.
[01:59:12.881 --> 01:59:17.846]  You gotta go get permission to have the person open it up because we have such rampant crime happening now.
[01:59:18.539 --> 01:59:23.122]  Yeah, you know, there's a great account on Twitter, another great one, Battle Beagle, good friend of mine.
[01:59:23.743 --> 01:59:28.527]  And he makes these outlandish, they sound outlandish, these predictions about what's coming.
[01:59:29.107 --> 01:59:32.409]  And many of them actually turn out to be, they end up being true.
[01:59:32.429 --> 01:59:45.440]   And one of them was last year, he said, A vision of the future for him that he saw was that stakes would eventually actually be behind locked glass, or you would need a store representative or employee to access a stake for you.
[01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:54.928]  And not too long ago, photos started circulating around, I think it was at a Walmart or a Target, where they actually had locking mechanisms on the stakes because too many of them were being stolen.
[01:59:54.988 --> 02:00:01.574]  So, you know, we can say, it's Walgreens, maybe I don't really shop at Walgreens, or I'm not in San Francisco, so it doesn't really affect me.
[02:00:01.854 --> 02:00:06.653]   This is something that's happening across the country and eventually it's going to be affecting the stakes that you
[02:00:06.653 --> 02:00:07.854]  want as well, or it already is.
[02:00:07.854 --> 02:00:12.854]   Well look at this one, you got police looking for somebody who sold $15,000 worth of meat.
[02:00:12.854 --> 02:00:14.854]  That's kind of an impressive meat heist.
[02:00:14.854 --> 02:00:20.854]   But yeah, it's... and I remember when it first started happening and people were complaining.
[02:00:20.648 --> 02:00:26.771]  They'd be like, oh my gosh, putting these products behind a locked door is racist.
[02:00:27.232 --> 02:00:33.435]  And you're saying, wait a second, you're the one that assuming that it's racist because I guess you're associating it with black people.
[02:00:33.816 --> 02:00:34.776]  Well, who's ever doing it?
[02:00:34.836 --> 02:00:40.439]  The point is, what are you supposed to do if you're Walmart or Walgreens and it's just all your stuff is getting stolen?
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:41.420]  What are you supposed to do?
[02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:42.801]  You have to put it behind locked glass.
[02:00:43.041 --> 02:00:44.642]  Right, or we see what's going on in San Francisco.
[02:00:44.682 --> 02:00:46.103]  They simply have to close the store.
[02:00:46.143 --> 02:00:51.848]  Walgreens has closed dozens of locations in San Francisco, the Bay Area, in recent years.
[02:00:51.988 --> 02:00:53.649]  Dude, I talk to people in D.C.
[02:00:53.729 --> 02:00:54.970]  and they're like, D.C.
[02:00:54.990 --> 02:00:55.431]  is gone.
[02:00:55.891 --> 02:00:56.652]  It's dead.
[02:00:56.812 --> 02:00:57.492]  Like, D.C.
[02:00:57.632 --> 02:00:59.234]  is dead with all the crime.
[02:00:59.254 --> 02:01:00.915]  I mean, half the buildings are boarded up.
[02:01:01.055 --> 02:01:02.216]  Nobody goes out to dinner.
[02:01:02.576 --> 02:01:03.597]  Nobody's going shopping.
[02:01:03.677 --> 02:01:04.478]  Everybody's leaving.
[02:01:05.398 --> 02:01:06.959]  That's the vision of the Democrat future.
[02:01:06.999 --> 02:01:10.142]  Just a dead shell of a society.
[02:01:11.055 --> 02:01:12.116]  Yeah, it's the cities.
[02:01:12.856 --> 02:01:17.519]  You know, we've been saying, some of us for years now, get out of the cities, and that is still my advice.
[02:01:17.579 --> 02:01:20.260]  Most cities are, you know, we should be escaping from this.
[02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:22.141]  I just sent this over to the crew.
[02:01:22.161 --> 02:01:24.863]  I believe this is a shot from Seattle.
[02:01:25.903 --> 02:01:26.744]  What are we looking at here?
[02:01:26.884 --> 02:01:27.264]  Shocking.
[02:01:29.225 --> 02:01:33.508]  Rampant drug use, ODs on the sidewalks in Seattle.
[02:01:34.309 --> 02:01:37.791]  And is this all stolen merchandise that they have all laying around too?
[02:01:37.871 --> 02:01:38.992]  It could be, it could be.
[02:01:39.012 --> 02:01:43.975]  Because I noticed they just have all this merchandise, some of it not even out of the box and it's just littered all about the ground.
[02:01:44.671 --> 02:01:46.974]  Look at all these people who have overdosed, they're slumped over.
[02:01:46.995 --> 02:01:48.436]  It's so sad.
[02:01:49.037 --> 02:01:50.399]  Just slowly killing themselves.
[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:52.923]  And that's the microcosm, that's the goal.
[02:01:53.684 --> 02:01:55.246]  The globalists want you dead.
[02:01:55.606 --> 02:01:59.572]  And if they can get you to kill yourself, that just makes the job so much easier for them.
[02:02:00.052 --> 02:02:03.374]  You know, they don't need to worry about forcing an injection that might kill ya.
[02:02:03.834 --> 02:02:05.055]  Oh, just go kill yourself!
[02:02:05.575 --> 02:02:06.075]  Yeah, go!
[02:02:06.115 --> 02:02:06.455]  Here, here!
[02:02:06.675 --> 02:02:07.856]  Here's a free crack pipe!
[02:02:08.216 --> 02:02:09.477]  Here's a free needle, you know?
[02:02:09.497 --> 02:02:10.757]  This is good for ya!
[02:02:11.118 --> 02:02:12.919]  It's the Clean Needle Act!
[02:02:12.959 --> 02:02:16.880]  And then you go through Seattle, and you see all these people, like, looking dead on the sidewalk.
[02:02:17.681 --> 02:02:21.503]  Ladies and gentlemen, final segment here with Dan Lyman, and then Jay Dyer is taking over.
[02:02:22.895 --> 02:02:24.636]  I want to tell you, we've got some exciting news.
[02:02:25.096 --> 02:02:30.578]  We've got a new sponsor here of InfoWars, and this is very cool stuff.
[02:02:30.598 --> 02:02:33.359]  Dan, in fact, if you would divulge, please.
[02:02:33.399 --> 02:02:36.500]  Yeah, put those bags on the desk, that they're right there.

[02:04:28.007 --> 02:04:31.210]  Now, Dan and I were actually discussing this last night.
[02:04:32.071 --> 02:04:38.337]  Mark Zuckerberg claims humans will live in Metaverse one day and leave reality behind, and it plays into this.
[02:04:38.998 --> 02:04:44.323]  It all connects with the climate change and eating the bugs and making the world ugly and destroying the economy.
[02:04:44.343 --> 02:04:51.109]  They want to make the world such an ugly, miserable place that you want to escape to the Metaverse, like you were talking about last night in Ready Player One.
[02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:55.992]  And then they'll also say, oh, but you're a hero because you're fighting climate change.
[02:04:56.032 --> 02:04:59.374]  So, oh, you're a hero, you now live in a pod and eat the bugs and everything.
[02:05:00.414 --> 02:05:05.357]  But look at how great the metaverse is, and you can be half man, half cat, or anything you want.
[02:05:06.638 --> 02:05:07.299]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[02:05:07.339 --> 02:05:19.188]  And you know, I've been thinking about this and trying to see where they're going with all of it, and the metaverse is really a disturbing potential direction for humanity to head.
[02:05:19.208 --> 02:05:32.138]  It has, of course, its appeals, and it sounds interesting to go into other worlds, you know, with your VR goggles and stuff, but ultimately what I think they would like is they've conditioned so many people just to be comfortable with being at home.
[02:05:32.578 --> 02:05:38.178]   and just staying in. I remember I recall the excuse to be lazy. Exactly. Netflix and chill.
[02:05:38.178 --> 02:05:43.378]   I remember during, you know, during 2020 when everything was really locked down,
[02:05:43.378 --> 02:05:47.218]   German media was putting out, they put out an article where basically they said,
[02:05:47.218 --> 02:05:51.057]  these are the heroes of the heroes of the pandemic. Are you?
[02:05:51.261 --> 02:06:04.132]  And the image they used was of a person laying on their couch watching TV and you were lionized because you were the one that was staying home, keeping everyone safe, making sure everyone that way got sick from you being out and about.
[02:06:04.472 --> 02:06:08.455]  So I think they basically created this world where people are very happy to be at home.
[02:06:09.316 --> 02:06:11.178]  And we see that with a lot of people.
[02:06:11.218 --> 02:06:16.903]  They were very happy to chill out at home and put on 30, 40 pounds and eat junk food and have Uber Eats deliver their food.
[02:06:17.583 --> 02:06:20.205]  And they have the excuse and the justification, so they just embrace it.
[02:06:20.425 --> 02:06:20.605]  Right.
[02:06:20.705 --> 02:06:29.691]  And the next step is, from Zoom world and Netflix world, the next leap there, you know, not a far leap, is just to put goggles on everyone.
[02:06:29.711 --> 02:06:38.737]  You remember that iconic photo of Mark Zuckerberg walking through a room full of people strapped into the goggles, and he looks extremely pleased with himself.
[02:06:39.337 --> 02:06:43.039]  I think that that is where the globalists would like a lot of people, just the humanity to head.
[02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:45.081]  Strap the goggles in and stay in your pod.
[02:06:45.649 --> 02:06:51.415]  And you know, it's something to me that is just, again, it's this weird, it's like alien.
[02:06:51.575 --> 02:06:52.916]  Who wants to live like that?
[02:06:53.056 --> 02:06:53.997]  Like, that's what I don't understand.
[02:06:54.058 --> 02:06:56.080]  Who doesn't like the world?
[02:06:56.380 --> 02:06:58.021]  You know, who doesn't like the sun?
[02:06:58.482 --> 02:06:59.823]  Who doesn't like a beach?
[02:07:00.224 --> 02:07:19.617]   Like, there's no amount of virtual reality or digital magnification or amplification that could ever Well, I think we've learned now that a disconcertingly large segment of the population actually doesn't love those things and is not craving those things.
[02:07:20.858 --> 02:07:25.120]  Thankfully, I don't think it's a majority, but still, it's a large segment, I would say.
[02:07:26.206 --> 02:07:30.972]  And it's like, what they do is, they, with the media, pretend like that's the majority.
[02:07:30.992 --> 02:07:32.653]  It's, oh, people want to go into the pod.
[02:07:32.934 --> 02:07:34.596]  People want to live in the virtual reality.
[02:07:35.096 --> 02:07:36.037]  I don't think so.
[02:07:36.177 --> 02:07:36.558]  I don't know.
[02:07:36.818 --> 02:07:39.301]  In fact, I don't really know anybody that's into that.
[02:07:39.361 --> 02:07:39.882]  Do you?
[02:07:40.102 --> 02:07:42.545]  I don't associate with anyone that is into that sort of thing.
[02:07:42.825 --> 02:07:45.406]  So, but you may be aware of some individuals?
[02:07:45.786 --> 02:07:46.286]  Possibly.
[02:07:46.646 --> 02:07:47.747]  I think we see them all day.
[02:07:48.027 --> 02:07:52.888]  They are the person, they are the people in these crazy videos that are protesting for masks.
[02:07:53.389 --> 02:07:57.350]  They are the people that are riding their motorcycles with their... I mean, just look at that.
[02:07:57.370 --> 02:07:58.570]  There's the photo right there.
[02:07:59.311 --> 02:08:00.371]  Yeah, the face suckers.
[02:08:00.791 --> 02:08:01.412]  Yeah.
[02:08:01.512 --> 02:08:06.097]  I can sit here and I can say I've never put on a virtual reality headset and I never plan to.
[02:08:06.237 --> 02:08:06.618]  Me neither.
[02:08:06.638 --> 02:08:08.039]  I think it's just bad juju.
[02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:09.300]  Yeah.
[02:08:09.861 --> 02:08:17.129]  It's one of those things that you just, there's an instinct to not, you just know if you do that, a part of your soul just died.
[02:08:17.349 --> 02:08:17.510]  Right.
[02:08:17.610 --> 02:08:18.391]  As soon as you do that.
[02:08:18.551 --> 02:08:18.731]  Yeah.
[02:08:18.951 --> 02:08:20.332]  Even if just for one minute.
[02:08:20.633 --> 02:08:20.793]  Right.
[02:08:20.833 --> 02:08:21.573]  It's your first hit.
[02:08:21.994 --> 02:08:23.055]  Don't go down that road.
[02:08:23.095 --> 02:08:24.136]  Don't take that first hit.
[02:08:24.236 --> 02:08:24.536]  Yeah.
[02:08:24.656 --> 02:08:25.957]  And then, oh, but look.
[02:08:26.478 --> 02:08:28.439]  You're saving climate change.
[02:08:28.460 --> 02:08:31.342]  And, oh, you're saving the planet.
[02:08:31.422 --> 02:08:33.624]  And then, oh, great!
[02:08:33.864 --> 02:08:36.667]  Now I can be fat and sit on my ass all day long!
[02:08:36.747 --> 02:08:38.028]  I'm saving the planet!
[02:08:38.068 --> 02:08:38.348]  Yeah!
[02:08:39.549 --> 02:08:40.610]  Oh look!
[02:08:40.690 --> 02:08:42.532]  I got a new Batman suit!
[02:08:42.792 --> 02:08:45.075]  I'm Batman in a virtual reality!
[02:08:45.275 --> 02:08:49.179]  And it's like a 600 pound dude just sitting in his bed with the goggles on.
[02:08:49.399 --> 02:08:49.599]  Look!
[02:08:49.739 --> 02:08:50.520]  I'm Batman!
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:51.321]  I'm Batman!
[02:08:52.779 --> 02:08:56.880]  Like, no, your soul is gone, dude.
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:08:58.260]  And that's what's so sad.
[02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:00.841]  You're just seeing... That's what's so alien about this.
[02:09:00.941 --> 02:09:02.401]  It's an attack on the human soul.
[02:09:02.461 --> 02:09:03.641]  It's an attack on the human spirit.
[02:09:03.661 --> 02:09:05.842]  It's about somehow ripping that away from us.
[02:09:06.562 --> 02:09:07.082]  Absolutely.
[02:09:07.402 --> 02:09:10.863]  And, you know, I think that that's really the endgame, is to rip our souls out.
[02:09:10.883 --> 02:09:17.624]  And that's what they've been doing with the conditioning, especially in the last couple of years, where it's just been demoralizing propaganda 24-7.
[02:09:17.844 --> 02:09:20.885]  And that's what they're doing to Russians now, too.
[02:09:22.216 --> 02:09:26.098]  Anna Netrebko, Russian soprano, out at the Metropolitan Opera.
[02:09:26.399 --> 02:09:31.382]  Oh, this Russian who's amazing at opera, she's not allowed to sing anymore because she's a Russian.
[02:09:33.083 --> 02:09:36.104]  Russia's saying, hey, look, the West is trying to cancel us.
[02:09:36.144 --> 02:09:36.845]  Yeah, they are.
[02:09:37.565 --> 02:09:40.947]  International Cat Federation bans Russian cats from all competitions.
[02:09:40.967 --> 02:09:41.628]  I mean, what the hell is that?
[02:09:41.868 --> 02:09:43.149]  I've never wanted a cat in my life.
[02:09:43.389 --> 02:09:44.650]  All of a sudden, I want a Russian cat.
[02:09:45.630 --> 02:09:46.751]  Where can I get a Russian cat?
[02:09:46.811 --> 02:09:48.192]  Let me save a Russian cat today.
[02:09:49.884 --> 02:09:50.985]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:09:51.165 --> 02:09:53.407]  Oh, Airbnb terminates service in Russia?
[02:09:53.447 --> 02:09:54.908]  Like, what is going on, man?
[02:09:55.329 --> 02:09:56.550]  They're gonna try to Gaddafi him.
[02:09:56.590 --> 02:09:57.431]  That's my big fear.
[02:09:58.071 --> 02:10:06.378]  And when you have Lindsey Graham and others caterwalling for nuclear war, you're just... We're going into a dark place, folks.
[02:10:06.418 --> 02:10:08.560]  And the sad thing is, we don't have the moral high ground here.
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:10.101]  That's what's really sad about this.
[02:10:12.190 --> 02:10:15.572]  I mean, China might already be in Taiwan.
[02:10:15.672 --> 02:10:18.433]  I mean, we probably wouldn't even hear about it if they went into Taiwan.
[02:10:18.854 --> 02:10:29.319]  Oh, but I'm sure the Democrats and the liberals in media and Hollywood that all stand with Ukraine, but wouldn't never dream of stepping foot in there to fight Putin.
[02:10:29.659 --> 02:10:32.741]  I'm sure if China went into Taiwan, they'd have the same response, don't you think?
[02:10:32.761 --> 02:10:36.103]  They'd all be wearing the Taiwanese shirts and saying how bad China is, don't you think?
[02:10:36.263 --> 02:10:45.147]  No, that will be a really interesting litmus test when that moment comes, how many of them are- Wait, you mean mainstream media and liberals aren't consistent with their logic and ideology?
[02:10:46.528 --> 02:10:48.149]  No, they don't have double standards, Dan.
[02:10:49.033 --> 02:10:50.134]  They know.
[02:10:50.214 --> 02:10:51.494]  They're going to be outraged.
[02:10:51.774 --> 02:10:56.977]  They're going to be calling Xi a dictator, and they're going to be calling for nuclear war with Xi, too, I'm sure.
[02:10:57.457 --> 02:11:02.540]  No, it will be a litmus test, and it'll show people what lying frauds and cowards they really are.
[02:11:03.501 --> 02:11:05.702]  Dan, it's been great to have you here in studio.
[02:11:05.742 --> 02:11:10.804]  You do great work over at Infowars.com, the Europe version as well.
[02:11:10.884 --> 02:11:13.986]   Your site, BorderHawk.com, I think you're planning on going to the border soon, too.
[02:11:14.367 --> 02:11:15.107]  We're working on that.
[02:11:15.127 --> 02:11:16.468]  We're making another trip down there.
[02:11:16.508 --> 02:11:19.510]  We sent someone down there a couple months ago, and it was a very fruitful trip.
[02:11:19.530 --> 02:11:23.313]  A lot of great exclusive content, and we're thinking about going back down there again.
[02:11:23.593 --> 02:11:37.803]  But while I have you, this opportunity, many of our viewers and friends and fans will know that Owen and I do our best to promote positive, healthy living, healthy diets, eating a lot of meat, getting a lot of sun, getting a lot of exercise.
[02:11:38.263 --> 02:11:40.345]  But with that being said, we all have our vices.
[02:11:41.165 --> 02:11:47.351]  And we all have our weaknesses, and Owen and I actually share a weakness for sour candy.
[02:11:47.971 --> 02:12:00.502]  And I know how hard it can be to find good quality sour candy that you can feel like you can indulge in, and I actually have found some very similar to sour Skittles, which is like the primo sour candy, but they're organic.
[02:12:00.782 --> 02:12:01.503]  Organic Skittles?
[02:12:01.523 --> 02:12:04.045]  So you can indulge in those and not feel quite as bad.
[02:12:04.105 --> 02:12:04.545]  Wow.
[02:12:04.985 --> 02:12:07.027]  And look at this, non-GMO and everything?
[02:12:07.067 --> 02:12:07.728]  Have you tried these?
[02:12:07.868 --> 02:12:08.909]  Oh, they're addictive.
[02:12:09.890 --> 02:12:12.574]  Have you seen, uh, I'll have to show you, have you seen my pantry at home?
[02:12:12.854 --> 02:12:13.015]  No.
[02:12:13.535 --> 02:12:20.866]  I literally have, like, I'm not proud of this, I literally have, like, the industrial box of Sour Patch Kids.
[02:12:21.647 --> 02:12:24.171]  Like, the, I mean, it's as big as my pantry.
[02:12:24.311 --> 02:12:24.712]  Dangerous.
[02:12:24.932 --> 02:12:27.915]  Yeah, but so you're saying this will stem the tide right here?
[02:12:28.195 --> 02:12:28.856]  They're so good.
[02:12:29.296 --> 02:12:29.937]  They're dangerous too.
[02:12:30.017 --> 02:12:31.718]  I'll probably leave this whole bag tonight.
[02:12:32.219 --> 02:12:34.001]  Dan Lyman, ladies and gentlemen, that does it for me.
[02:12:34.061 --> 02:12:34.962]  What a week it's been.
[02:12:35.282 --> 02:12:36.523]  Thanks to everybody for tuning in.
[02:12:37.164 --> 02:12:42.749]  Jay Dyer is taking over now, and we're going to have Christy Lee hosting the War Room for me today.
[02:12:42.769 --> 02:12:46.673]  I'm going to take a well-deserved break this afternoon, show Dan a little bit around Austin.
[02:12:46.993 --> 02:12:48.394]  Infowarsstore.com, folks.
[02:12:48.234 --> 02:13:02.734]  Folks, keep us on the air.
[02:13:02.742 --> 02:13:13.298]   If you will simply get X3 with all three types of good iodine that boost your immune system and help everything that goes on in your body at the cellular level, It will change your life.

[02:13:14.559 --> 02:13:15.380]  It will empower you.
[02:13:15.761 --> 02:13:18.744]  Almost everyone has ionide deficiency.
[02:13:18.824 --> 02:13:20.366]  Look into it for yourself.
[02:13:20.446 --> 02:13:21.768]  It's the opposite of fluoride.
[02:13:21.888 --> 02:13:23.530]  It's the good halogen.

[02:13:27.475 --> 02:13:32.799]  Now, a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because of the lockdowns and supply chain breakdowns.
[02:13:33.219 --> 02:13:35.080]  We were sold out of X3 for a long time.
[02:13:35.620 --> 02:13:38.202]  And I had it on sale for 50% off, and a lot of folks were getting it.
[02:13:38.642 --> 02:13:39.783]  And I was thinking, you know what?
[02:13:39.843 --> 02:13:42.905]  I'm going to bring it back on sale again, just until it sells out.
[02:13:43.466 --> 02:13:50.430]  Because even though we won't make as much money in the long run, a lot of folks need this product, and we need to get the money from the sales in now to stay on air.
[02:13:50.529 --> 02:14:11.529]   See your X3 right now at 50% off at m4warstore.com The first casualty of war is the truth.
[02:14:12.153 --> 02:14:14.856]  And if the American people knew the truth about U.S.
[02:14:14.937 --> 02:14:19.803]  interference in Ukraine, they might not be so eager to start World War III.
[02:14:20.885 --> 02:14:24.410]  During World War II, Western Ukraine sided with the Nazis.
[02:14:25.291 --> 02:14:34.221]  After the war, the CIA helped Ukrainian Nazis evade the Nuremberg Trials and began operating with them within the Ukraine.
[02:14:34.961 --> 02:14:39.826]  After decades of CIA infiltration, the Ukrainian People's Movement emerged in 1989.
[02:14:41.688 --> 02:14:47.133]  And gave birth to extremist groups, Svoboda, Trident, and Right Sector.
[02:14:47.833 --> 02:14:51.476]  Neo-Nazi groups pushing for the ethnic cleansing of Ukraine.
[02:14:52.077 --> 02:14:56.020]  Extremist groups cultivated by the CIA, supported by the U.S.
[02:14:56.040 --> 02:15:00.523]  State Department, and used by the IMF to bring Ukraine to heel.
[02:15:01.724 --> 02:15:20.200]   When Yanukovych beat NATO-backed Yushchenko in the 2010 elections, His government was being pressured into signing an EU Association Agreement by the International Monetary Fund in their typical conquer-by-debt offer that would financially ruin the Ukraine and place them at the mercy of the World Bank.
[02:15:21.221 --> 02:15:23.323]  Yanukovych declined their offer.
[02:15:24.404 --> 02:15:28.408]  And in today's corrupt world, you're not allowed to say no to the IMF.
[02:15:30.180 --> 02:15:39.940]  Funded by Western NGOs associated with George Soros and the CIA, a highly organized color revolution was immediately deployed against Yanukovych.
[02:15:41.039 --> 02:15:55.173]  Organizations such as the National Endowment for Democracy trained activist journalists to utilize Facebook along with three brand new television networks created within weeks to recruit people for the protests.
[02:15:55.874 --> 02:15:59.558]  This Western-run media campaign was a huge success.
[02:16:00.278 --> 02:16:01.520]  The turnout was massive.
[02:16:03.473 --> 02:16:13.682]  The CIA has been orchestrating revolutions their entire career, and the first step to their simple formula is to convince people to take to the streets in peaceful protest.
[02:16:14.383 --> 02:16:23.671]  They then use agitators to goad the police into violence, and state-run media to ignite the crowd with emotionally charged reports of sacred victims.
[02:16:24.892 --> 02:16:30.915]  On November 30th, 2013, the Ukrainian Chief of Staff, associated closely with the U.S.
[02:16:30.955 --> 02:16:37.038]  State Department, ordered the streets to be cleared of protesters for the erection of the annual Christmas tree.
[02:16:37.759 --> 02:16:52.726]  When the police arrived, they were met by a highly aggressive and well-organized faction of Ukraine's right sector, who provoked the police into a violent reaction against peaceful protesters, which is all the Western intelligence media reported on.
[02:16:53.486 --> 02:16:59.730]  Predictably, this resulted in more unrest and violence, which was further fueled by U.S.
[02:16:59.770 --> 02:17:02.711]  Senator John McCain's support of the protests.
[02:17:03.592 --> 02:17:05.693]  Leaked phone calls reveal that the U.S.
[02:17:05.733 --> 02:17:09.835]  State Department was orchestrating this coup d'etat from within the U.S.
[02:17:09.935 --> 02:17:13.057]  Embassy with support from Vice President Joe Biden.
[02:17:14.782 --> 02:17:25.848]  On February 20th, unidentified snipers, firing from government buildings occupied by the protesters, began firing into the crowd, killing people on all sides.
[02:17:26.809 --> 02:17:43.277]  Yenikovik's home and offices were taken by armed mobs, and a new government was put into place with a neo-Nazi element that went on to accept the IMF's spurious loan offer, and began murdering the Russian-speaking population of Ukraine in Donbass.
[02:17:44.818 --> 02:17:52.263]  As a result of this Western-created quagmire, 96% of the people in Crimea voted in favor of joining Russia.
[02:17:53.064 --> 02:17:57.867]  And while the nation celebrated, Western media reported that they were invaded by Russia.
[02:17:58.447 --> 02:17:58.948]  Their proof?
[02:17:59.468 --> 02:18:02.650]  A Russian military presence which has existed there since 1804.
[02:18:04.819 --> 02:18:08.702]  Supporting a criminal war against Russia does not make you a patriot.
[02:18:09.302 --> 02:18:12.865]  It makes you a useful idiot of the globalist banking cartel.
[02:18:13.285 --> 02:18:19.449]  The very same entities waging war on all of humanity with vaccine passports and experimental jabs.
[02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:23.632]  A righteous patriot would call out his government for war crimes.
[02:18:24.313 --> 02:18:31.158]  And through fraud and deceit, the United States government has been the world's biggest purveyor of war crimes for decades.
[02:18:31.958 --> 02:18:38.462]  All in the name of spreading McDonald's, genetically modified foods, and sexual perversions worldwide.
[02:18:39.541 --> 02:18:42.021]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reis.
[02:18:42.021 --> 02:18:56.341]  [Music]
[02:18:56.341 --> 02:18:57.621]  Welcome back to the Oxygen Show.
[02:18:57.692 --> 02:19:00.013]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:19:01.209 --> 02:19:12.777]  Head over to my YouTube channel, you'll notice that I did a recent lecture last night, breaking down the wider setting for this Ukraine crisis that's going on.
[02:19:12.797 --> 02:19:25.625]  And I want to get into that today, kind of condense that a little bit, because a lot of people don't know the real reason for this, the historical setting for this conflict, and how it ultimately ties into the long-term global elite strategy.
[02:19:26.546 --> 02:19:34.469]  The technocratic plan and the idea of creating, as we said, a Skynet-style one-world government where masses are depopulated.
[02:19:34.929 --> 02:19:36.890]  How would this Ukraine situation fit into that?
[02:19:36.910 --> 02:19:37.850]  Well, let's get into that.
[02:19:37.950 --> 02:19:50.815]  Let's go back a little bit and recall when we discussed in our Tragedy and Hope lectures, right, by Dr. Carol Quigley, the famous historian and archivist for the Council on Foreign Relations, the mentor to Bill Clinton.
[02:19:51.681 --> 02:20:05.587]  In Tragedy and Hope, Carol Quigley summarized his 1300-page tome by saying that the goal of the 20th century for the Western Anglo-American establishment elites was to knock out their two rivals.
[02:20:05.687 --> 02:20:09.888]  Those two rivals were the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Russian Empire.
[02:20:10.389 --> 02:20:20.713]  And when those two rivals were basically exhausted, depleted, and destroyed from warfare, the Anglo-American establishment could step forward as the preeminent sole world power.
[02:20:21.425 --> 02:20:23.185]  Now, this is not the United States.
[02:20:23.486 --> 02:20:39.089]  This is the United States co-opted by an interclick of British Royal Society elites, aka the Royal Institute for International Affairs, following that Cecil Rhodes, John Ruskin model of a world Fabian socialist government.
[02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:58.162]   And so the plan that they had to retake America was to send a bunch of British spies over In the 40s and to get the American establishment on board with the British Empire, the fading waning British Empires, foreign entanglements and world control.
[02:20:59.611 --> 02:21:01.892]  This led to the Pax Americana.
[02:21:01.972 --> 02:21:06.173]  The Pax Americana was really, as we said, manufactured or sort of co-op.
[02:21:06.194 --> 02:21:19.038]  It was a coup, you could say, on the part of people like Ian Fleming, William Stevenson, on the part of people like Noel Coward, to influence the government in the U.S., FDR, etc., to get involved in these conflicts.
[02:21:20.339 --> 02:21:23.600]  And this leads to not just World War II, but also to the Cold War.
[02:21:24.793 --> 02:21:36.268]  And so you can see on the part of the elites of the West, they have a strategy to utilize the engine of America to bring the rest of the world under a kind of global government.
[02:21:37.063 --> 02:21:45.749]  Now, when they were promoting this in the last century, they promoted it as the idea of a democratic, capitalist, liberal world order.
[02:21:46.170 --> 02:22:00.798]   So we have to go back to the ideology that comes out of the Enlightenment, the classical liberal order, and point out that while there were some good elements in the classical liberal order, the problem is that just like it's communist opponent that comes out of that same
[02:22:00.798 --> 02:22:02.038]  enlightenment philosophy.
[02:22:02.038 --> 02:22:06.398]   You get two kind of schools of thought, you could say, a revolutionary philosophy
[02:22:06.398 --> 02:22:08.398]  that comes out of the French Revolution.
[02:22:08.398 --> 02:22:10.519]  You get the Jacobins and you get the Garondins.
[02:22:10.519 --> 02:22:14.957]   And both sides of this philosophy are part of a similar dialectic.
[02:22:14.957 --> 02:22:19.278]   Not saying that everybody was evil that had the revolutionary philosophy.
[02:22:19.374 --> 02:22:25.360]  We know that the American founding fathers definitely had a better approach than the Jacobins, who were very extreme.
[02:22:25.420 --> 02:22:30.385]  You know, that led to a radical form of communism that murdered tens of thousands of people in France, for example.
[02:22:30.826 --> 02:22:37.405]   But the American order also had a revolutionary impetus. And in my view, it's a
[02:22:37.405 --> 02:22:42.446]   mix of ideas. You have good ideas from Christianity, from Mosaic law, biblical law, but you also
[02:22:42.446 --> 02:22:44.846]  have a revolutionary impetus as well.
[02:22:44.846 --> 02:22:49.805]   So I think in the history of America, you have kind of an internal struggle throughout her
[02:22:49.805 --> 02:22:53.885]   history to figure out whether she wants to go in the path of something more Christian
[02:22:53.885 --> 02:22:57.565]  or something that's more revolutionary and more controlling.
[02:22:57.755 --> 02:23:02.357]  And so, where America would go, right, would be dependent upon who would control the country.
[02:23:02.477 --> 02:23:10.601]  And in the 20th century, according to Quigley, you have pretty much the rise and complete dominance of America by the oligarchs and the Robert Barons.
[02:23:11.121 --> 02:23:17.201]   And these Robert Barons and these oligarchs that ended up controlling America, the Rockefellers,
[02:23:17.201 --> 02:23:23.322]   the JP Morgans, the Carnegies, these families, Vanderbilt, et cetera, they end up aligning
[02:23:23.322 --> 02:23:27.541]   themselves with this elite British clique that I'm talking about.
[02:23:27.541 --> 02:23:32.121]   And that's why you have the establishment of Pratt House, you have the establishment
[02:23:32.121 --> 02:23:36.320]   of Council on Foreign Relations, you have the establishment of Trilateral Commission.
[02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:40.601]   All of these are entities mirroring the roundtable groups out of the English clique that we're
[02:23:40.601 --> 02:23:41.921]  talking about here.
[02:23:41.921 --> 02:23:48.520]   The Lords of London, Lord Curtis, Lord Balfour, Lord Rothschild, Cecil Rhodes, et cetera,
[02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:52.361]   they're all aligned with the American Eastern seaboard elite.
[02:23:52.361 --> 02:23:56.800]   And that is what will be the locus of power for the Anglo-American establishment or sometimes
[02:23:56.800 --> 02:23:59.441]  called the Atlantis' power block.
[02:23:59.441 --> 02:24:05.001]   And unfortunately, they were successful in winning those two wars and kicking off that
[02:24:05.001 --> 02:24:05.681]  Cold War.
[02:24:06.115 --> 02:24:09.377]  I'm not saying that the other powers were the good guys and we're the bad guys.
[02:24:09.437 --> 02:24:17.804]  I'm saying the reason it's unfortunate is because this is the preparation for a kind of global government that we're going into now.
[02:24:18.065 --> 02:24:28.855]   This is a hundred-plus-year-old plan by these same people, and that's why there's such a powerful continuity of agenda To what we read in people like Bertrand Russell and Lord Birkenhead and H.G.
[02:24:28.895 --> 02:24:32.936]  Wells and all these guys writing 100, 120 years ago, right?
[02:24:33.697 --> 02:24:36.617]  The exact same plan is coming in right now.
[02:24:36.698 --> 02:24:44.080]  So how do we want to situate the Ukraine situation in this global crisis, 20th century world war scenario?
[02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:54.763]  If we understand the Cold War as a kind of third world war, then we will understand the Ukraine scenario because Ukraine as a crisis comes out of the Cold War.
[02:24:56.101 --> 02:25:01.951]  So remember that the imperial model of the West is one that is cloaked as non-imperial.
[02:25:02.371 --> 02:25:10.880]   Freedom, democracy, it wears a vesture, it wears a cloak, a vestment of Human rights and democracy.
[02:25:11.300 --> 02:25:27.607]  But in reality, it is a shadow government, as Bernays said, democracy is always run by a shadow invisible elite, Bernays said, that is a kind of secret security establishment, a shadow government run by very powerful banking families and industrialist families.
[02:25:27.907 --> 02:25:35.528]   And they want to see a technocratic global government that is the Malthusian philosophy From several hundred years ago, right?
[02:25:35.548 --> 02:25:40.509]  The Anglican minister, Thomas Malthus, who aligned his philosophy with Darwinianism.
[02:25:41.890 --> 02:25:46.032]  Darwinian philosophy being not a scientific theory, properly speaking.
[02:25:46.092 --> 02:25:50.073]  It has elements of a scientific theory, but it's also a grand narrative philosophy.
[02:25:50.733 --> 02:26:05.820]   So uniting that philosophy of Darwinism, materialism and flux and process with the idea of pragmatism from America, you get a pragmatic Anglo-empiricist philosophy.
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:10.181]  And by empiricism, I just mean pure, raw matter and sense data.
[02:26:10.221 --> 02:26:10.942]  That's all there is.
[02:26:10.982 --> 02:26:12.182]  There's no higher principles.
[02:26:12.542 --> 02:26:14.603]  There's no higher things that we are subject to.
[02:26:15.103 --> 02:26:16.363]  There's nothing transcendent.
[02:26:16.464 --> 02:26:17.784]  It's just matter in motion.
[02:26:18.507 --> 02:26:27.692]  And in fact, dialectical materialism, the philosophy of most of the Marxists, or historical materialism of some of the other Marxists, the Soviet bloc, it's another analog.
[02:26:27.712 --> 02:26:29.593]  It's just part of that same type of system.
[02:26:29.613 --> 02:26:44.360]  So it doesn't matter whether it's capitalist monopoly capitalism based on atheistic dialectical materialism, or whether it's the philosophy of Marxism and collectivism, which is also based on a kind of dialectical materialism and process philosophy.
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:48.162]  Both of these are flip sides of the same atheistic materialist coin.
[02:26:49.170 --> 02:27:16.131]  And Quigley even speaks of this in Tragedy and Hope where he says that the two World Wars and the Cold War aren't just about getting rid of rivals to the West, it's also about getting rid of the ideological clash, the ideological problem that the Western degenerate elites have with any other potential rival system that could emerge that could have any kind of reference to a higher transcendent principle.
[02:27:17.290 --> 02:27:32.309]  And so it must, of necessity, go after and knock out any worldview, any system, any leader that could potentially rise to be a challenge to the radical, materialist, atheist, reductionist system of the West.
[02:27:33.081 --> 02:27:35.242]  This is really the operating system of the British Empire.
[02:27:35.282 --> 02:27:49.351]  This is why so many of the philosophers that came out of the British Empire, David Hume, right, these kinds of people who were radical materialist atheists, really set the stage for the Royal Society's philosophy to dominate in the last several hundred years of academia.
[02:27:49.771 --> 02:27:53.554]  This is why Darwinism is taught everywhere in the world without question.
[02:27:53.974 --> 02:27:57.036]  Now, many professors do question it, but I'm speaking generally here.
[02:27:58.132 --> 02:28:00.773]  So this leads to what we call a post-modern imperialism.
[02:28:00.833 --> 02:28:10.818]  The post-modern empire is no longer committed to even the enlightenment principles of transcendent ideals, of universal notions of rights and justice.
[02:28:10.918 --> 02:28:15.781]  It has undercut those as well because there's no such thing as universal ideas.
[02:28:16.497 --> 02:28:17.417]  Universal principles.
[02:28:17.577 --> 02:28:19.238]  There's no such thing as the abstract truths.
[02:28:19.538 --> 02:28:21.298]  There's only will to power.
[02:28:21.839 --> 02:28:32.141]  And so the modernist empire, the classical liberal empire, falls and submits to the nihilistic Nietzschean approach, the Ubermensch, the will to power.
[02:28:32.201 --> 02:28:38.063]  That's why the establishment says and can say competing, contradicting narratives from week to week.
[02:28:38.809 --> 02:28:43.252]  Because truth is whatever the establishment dictates it is, right?
[02:28:43.332 --> 02:28:44.733]  It's not submitting to anything else.
[02:28:44.773 --> 02:28:45.334]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:28:45.354 --> 02:28:46.775]  We're going to explain this when we come back.
[02:28:46.795 --> 02:28:48.676]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:48.776 --> 02:29:02.226]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis, and I was just talking about my lecture that I did last night over on YouTube covering the liberal imperium, the clash of ideologies and the preceding ideologies that led us to this present-day clash.
[02:29:02.746 --> 02:29:09.810]  Now, we were talking about how the Cold War was a kind of dialectic between Western capitalism or monopoly capitalism, really.
[02:29:09.850 --> 02:29:12.692]  It's not really the classical free market capitalism.
[02:29:12.752 --> 02:29:27.880]  It's a Robert Barron monopoly capitalism over against the collectivist view of the, you know, Eurasian communism or collectivism that was actually exported to the West, by the way, as a weapon of cultural warfare and revolution.
[02:29:28.678 --> 02:29:44.047]  Now, the exportation of Bolshevism and communism to Russia and to Eurasia was for the purpose of destroying, as we said, those regimes, collectivizing the wealth, transferring it offshore to private banks and so forth as a means of control.
[02:29:45.107 --> 02:29:48.069]  And we saw, of course, the same situation with the Cold War, as we said.
[02:29:48.529 --> 02:29:56.614]  On the ground, of course, there's a lot of people really fighting this, what Brzezinski called a Manichean dialectic, a managed dialectic between East and West, good guy, bad guy.
[02:29:57.521 --> 02:30:03.946]  That was very much hyped up for the purpose, I believe, of erecting what would become the technocracy.
[02:30:03.966 --> 02:30:16.797]  So the Cold War allows us to make all these advances in technology, computing, cryptography, that will put in the infrastructure that will lead to the Great Reset, the Skynet technocratic order.
[02:30:16.917 --> 02:30:21.321]  So the Cold War was one of the stages of the steps towards that long-term goal.
[02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:34.953]  And we were talking about the operating system of the West, the philosophy, the ideology that clashes with, in the 20th century, the competing ideologies of postmodern imperialism, atheism, materialism, process philosophy.
[02:30:34.973 --> 02:30:40.619]  I know that a lot of people in the West said they believed in God, but the operating system itself was really just atheistic.
[02:30:41.517 --> 02:30:42.057]  At the top.
[02:30:42.397 --> 02:30:56.822]  So Anglo-Empiricism, Evolutionary Philosophy, Flux, Revolution, that is the operating system that ended up clashing with the two, the rival empires in the 20th century, the Austro-Hungarian and Russia.
[02:30:57.862 --> 02:31:06.029]  And so, Russia, according to Quigley, had to be stopped because it represents an older operating system of Orthodox Christianity.
[02:31:06.510 --> 02:31:17.239]  Now, of course, the last hundred years of revolution in Russia did a lot to damage and destroy the influence of Orthodox Christianity in Russia, and by extension also Orthodoxy in the Ukraine, too.
[02:31:19.640 --> 02:31:36.879]  The reason that matters is because if Russia emerges out of the Cold War as a power that intends to resurrect or maintain some of that older Orthodox Christian ethos, then it becomes a problem for the West, you see, and for NATO.
[02:31:37.483 --> 02:31:40.887]  So the question there is not so much about Putin himself's motives.
[02:31:40.967 --> 02:31:42.729]  We can't really know people's motives.
[02:31:42.769 --> 02:31:46.994]  It's hard to know that reading all this flurry of media propaganda.
[02:31:47.434 --> 02:32:18.077]   But whether Putin's motives are correct or false or whatever, sincere in terms of his promotion of Orthodox Christianity and the symbolism of the Russian Empire and the Tsar and all this kind of stuff, I don't know that, but what I can do is try to judge the objective facts and the way that Brzezinski and people like this who had a huge role in destroying, bringing down the Soviet Empire, the way he speaks of this and what he said about it, and he said that the Ukraine would be crucial to control because it is a kind of
[02:32:19.204 --> 02:32:23.548]  It's the linchpin upon which Russia has to influence Europe.
[02:32:23.948 --> 02:32:30.994]  So if you want to cut off Russia to influence Europe away from NATO and away from the US, you would have to control the Ukraine.
[02:32:31.014 --> 02:32:32.175]  That was Brzezinski's idea.
[02:32:32.215 --> 02:32:41.083]  So Brzezinski said it is crucial then in the Ukraine and all the Soviet bloc countries to peel that away from the influence of Russia and Putin.
[02:32:41.583 --> 02:32:43.946]  And so that's what's been going on for the last 30 years.
[02:32:44.006 --> 02:32:49.271]  And you just heard that Gregg Reese report where he was talking about what I was going to get into, the notion of color revolution.
[02:32:49.832 --> 02:33:04.983]   In the early 80s, this began in those Soviet bloc countries as Reagan eventually in the 80s, he moves a lot of intelligence and espionage works out of the domain of military and out of the domain of The CIA and even into privatized groups.
[02:33:05.323 --> 02:33:14.767]  So you have a privatized intelligence network that can use cover of things like NGOs and think tanks and foundations and that's where you get this color revolution model.
[02:33:14.807 --> 02:33:20.910]  And at that time Soros was kind of partnered with the CIA to go and do this stuff in these former Soviet bloc countries.
[02:33:21.270 --> 02:33:27.689]   And what they did was soft power, where you influence nation states and existing regimes
[02:33:27.689 --> 02:33:33.569]   to be allied with you, right, through anything that might, that could be money, it could
[02:33:33.569 --> 02:33:36.810]  be culture, cultural warfare is part of soft power.
[02:33:36.810 --> 02:33:39.328]  And that's different or distinct from hard power, right?
[02:33:39.362 --> 02:33:39.802]  Warfare.
[02:33:40.322 --> 02:33:43.883]  And so the model of using soft power was done for a long time.
[02:33:43.903 --> 02:33:47.584]  In the 90s, they were putting money into the Ukraine, what was called the Orange Revolution.
[02:33:47.624 --> 02:33:57.728]  That was all engineered by Soros and the National Endowment for Democracy, all these different NGOs and think tanks that were at the behest of or the cover for what the CIA used to do.
[02:33:59.268 --> 02:34:01.731]  So, you got the Orange Revolution.
[02:34:01.771 --> 02:34:05.896]  It didn't really work, but they did finally get their coup in 2014.
[02:34:06.115 --> 02:34:12.396]   And so from 2014 to now, you've had many, many thousands of Russians killed in that
[02:34:12.396 --> 02:34:18.316]   eastern Ukraine region, right, over this issue and over trying to peel away the Ukraine from
[02:34:18.316 --> 02:34:22.876]   Russian influence in the sphere of Russia because it's such a key location.
[02:34:22.876 --> 02:34:29.435]   In fact, in World War II, Hitler was very intent on promoting the peeling away of Ukraine.
[02:34:29.435 --> 02:34:31.075]  That was a strategy that Hitler used.
[02:34:31.075 --> 02:34:36.556]   That's why, partly why, there's so many neo-Nazi minded people in the Ukraine to this day.
[02:34:36.556 --> 02:34:40.735]   And they're still being used right now and funded and aided by the West as a geopolitical
[02:34:40.735 --> 02:34:42.575]  chess piece and a tool.
[02:34:42.575 --> 02:34:45.514]  And so that's really the context of what's going on.
[02:34:45.514 --> 02:34:51.115]   And that's why the provocations and the continual poking of the bear, so to speak, is what led
[02:34:51.115 --> 02:34:58.514]   to the reaction of Russia, the ignoring of NATO's promise not to expand and so forth,
[02:34:58.954 --> 02:35:10.343]  That was all done intentionally to provoke this conflict, and that's because the idea here is ultimately to get probably Putin bogged down and probably try to wear him out and to destroy Russia.
[02:35:10.923 --> 02:35:14.547]  Again, not because we're sitting here trying to figure out whether Putin's a good guy or a bad guy.
[02:35:14.607 --> 02:35:18.170]  In geopolitics, it's power relations and objective questions.
[02:35:18.210 --> 02:35:22.154]  We can't really figure out everybody's motives, whether they really believe Christianity or not.
[02:35:22.655 --> 02:35:32.865]  Regardless, whether it's a tool or whether he really believes it, from the globalist NATO elite perspective, you have to not allow any potential challenger.
[02:35:32.925 --> 02:35:35.207]  Brzezinski wrote about this many, many times in his books.
[02:35:35.991 --> 02:35:40.301]  No potential challenger can be allowed to arise in Eurasia at all.
[02:35:40.481 --> 02:35:44.529]  And so that's why Putin is a problem from the perspective of the Western elites.
[02:35:45.174 --> 02:35:54.979]  Because any strongman that would arise with any even tenuous connection to the notions of tradition or the notions of authority have to be destroyed.
[02:35:54.999 --> 02:36:07.806]  And that's the logic of the appearance of Western democracy and democratic liberalism is that it must destroy anything like that because that is a challenge to the logic of the Western liberal neoliberal order, you see.
[02:36:09.026 --> 02:36:10.227]  That's what's going on here.
[02:36:10.327 --> 02:36:16.200]   It is ultimately a clash of ideological views and that's why it's not even necessarily
[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:17.239]  about the Ukraine anymore.
[02:36:17.239 --> 02:36:22.519]   The same people that supported all the coup stuff have just in one week automatically
[02:36:22.519 --> 02:36:28.838]   changed over into being supporting the Ukraine. And so it's a global conflict because it's a
[02:36:28.838 --> 02:36:34.920]   global clash of rival ideological systems and that's why in the speech Putin referenced things
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:38.359]  like the gender and biological identity attack, right?
[02:36:38.566 --> 02:36:52.983]  Because he knows, and the patriarch of the Russian church has said the same thing for the last several years, that the ideological battle, the toxic culture battle that's going on with the promotion of those things is a form of cultural warfare.
[02:36:53.812 --> 02:36:54.032]  Right.
[02:36:54.192 --> 02:36:58.754]  Remember, soft power is it also includes that kind of stuff, right?
[02:36:58.854 --> 02:36:59.974]  Cutting off peepees.
[02:37:00.014 --> 02:37:02.295]  That's part of the cultural toxic warfare.
[02:37:02.815 --> 02:37:05.376]  It is an exported warfare ideology.
[02:37:05.896 --> 02:37:09.917]  And so that's why it has led to that's one of the many reasons that has led to this.
[02:37:10.317 --> 02:37:11.557]  There's other reasons as well.
[02:37:11.617 --> 02:37:14.898]  Resources in eastern Ukraine, right?
[02:37:15.118 --> 02:37:17.559]  It's a mineral rich, resource rich area.
[02:37:17.859 --> 02:37:19.480]  That's another part to play in this.
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:23.281]  And so it's a battle over ideology, ultimately.
[02:37:23.801 --> 02:37:25.342]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:37:25.362 --> 02:37:26.483]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:37:26.302 --> 02:37:28.302]  We'll get into this more when we come back.
[02:37:28.302 --> 02:37:30.302]  Welcome back to the Oxfam Show.
[02:37:30.302 --> 02:37:32.302]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:37:32.302 --> 02:37:38.302]   We were talking about the Cold War setting and how we got to where we are in this dialectical conflict.
[02:37:38.302 --> 02:37:45.302]   And how, according to Brzezinski's model, the famous technocratic Cold War strategist,
[02:37:45.302 --> 02:37:52.302]   that basically set in motion that arc of crisis model where you would destabilize all the Soviet satellites
[02:37:52.302 --> 02:37:55.302]  in order to make them amenable to the West.
[02:37:55.408 --> 02:38:07.445]  And then you use that NGO model, that soft power model, to prep the people for the eventual regime change that the CIA would manufacture or cause via their human rights NGO cover.
[02:38:10.057 --> 02:38:24.190]  And so that's what we've seen really in the last several years with these kinds of conflicts and regime change operations is that Kola Revolution model and Brzezinski of course pointing out that Ukraine is crucial to the control of Eurasia, right?
[02:38:24.230 --> 02:38:32.058]  It's the heartland and this goes back to Lord Alfred Mackinder's British Imperial model of the way to control the world is to control the Eurasian heartland.
[02:38:32.698 --> 02:38:34.160]  Other people disagree with that.
[02:38:34.180 --> 02:38:35.381]  They say, no, it's the Rimland.
[02:38:35.441 --> 02:38:46.311]  But regardless, for a lot of the time of World War II and up into the Cold War, the heartland theory of the British Empire also dominated in the Pax Americana.
[02:38:46.771 --> 02:38:52.016]  And according to Brzezinski, that's why you have to control on the chessboard the heartland.
[02:38:52.691 --> 02:39:12.647]  And so to do this, right, this is what helps contain Russia, but it looks more and more like the global elite due to the potential rise of anything that could suggest a symbolic figure like a Putin or something like this or Russia or orthodoxy as a challenge to Western Anglo empiricism.
[02:39:13.688 --> 02:39:17.650]  It's an empiricist imperialism, if you catch my drift here, in terms of philosophy.
[02:39:18.130 --> 02:39:28.537]  Anything that could challenge that has to be neutralized and destroyed, and that's precisely why we've seen in the last 20 years such an anti-Russian hyping up in the media.
[02:39:28.977 --> 02:39:42.952]  It's because the Western ethos is now committed to a complete will-to-power philosophy that evolved out of their universalist notions from the Enlightenment of universal principles of the Enlightenment and so forth.
[02:39:43.733 --> 02:39:50.861]  But if evolutionary philosophy is true and pragmatism are true, then you can see that there's actually no principles that actually exist.
[02:39:51.505 --> 02:39:58.088]  Principles are also subject to evolution and thus the principles evolved to be whatever the power structure says they are.
[02:39:58.608 --> 02:40:03.371]  It is a pure will to power postmodern imperialism is what we actually have in the West.
[02:40:04.091 --> 02:40:08.373]  And that's the logic of the monopoly capitalist neoliberal power.
[02:40:08.573 --> 02:40:12.815]  That's it must commit that it must do that because of the logic of its own system.
[02:40:12.835 --> 02:40:13.776]  That's what it dictates.
[02:40:14.736 --> 02:40:18.338]  And so democratic capitalism is not even really a thing.
[02:40:18.538 --> 02:40:23.363]   It is a neoliberal As we said, post-modernism.
[02:40:23.684 --> 02:40:26.628]  And that's why identity now must be destroyed.
[02:40:26.728 --> 02:40:28.110]  Identity is broken down.
[02:40:28.170 --> 02:40:28.892]  It doesn't exist.
[02:40:29.688 --> 02:40:31.769]  It's not just that you're an atomized individual.
[02:40:31.849 --> 02:40:34.170]  Now the individual must be divided.
[02:40:34.430 --> 02:40:35.891]  There is no individual anymore.
[02:40:36.371 --> 02:40:39.892]  Identity itself is now a consumer product which you can purchase.
[02:40:40.332 --> 02:40:46.535]  You can now be, you can purchase whatever biology you want to be, whatever ideology you want, right?
[02:40:46.555 --> 02:40:54.078]  You can be whatever you want and that's why the metaverse will be a completely postmodern attack on reality itself.
[02:40:54.901 --> 02:41:03.727]  It will allow you to be duped into, deluded into, believing that you are the dragon flying around in, you know, Zuckerberg's metaverse, right?
[02:41:05.067 --> 02:41:15.494]  It is an ultimate form of delusion that is the logical outcome of the nihilistic revolutionary ethos that the West has adopted, unfortunately.
[02:41:16.334 --> 02:41:23.459]  And so, this delusion, the simulacrum, will become the reality, as the famous philosopher Jean Baudrillard said.
[02:41:25.435 --> 02:41:48.987]  In order to understand all of this, it's also important to understand the rise of homo economicus, because that's not a pejorative, that's an actual term going back to philosophers and geopolitical thinkers like Oswald Spengler, who pointed out that whether you're a monopoly capitalist or whether you're a revolutionary socialist Marxist, the underlying presupposition about man in that system is that he is an economic object.
[02:41:49.875 --> 02:41:58.401]  And so the man as a purely economic object then becomes eventually subject to a universal debt-based system.
[02:41:59.247 --> 02:42:06.751]  And the governing structures of the last, well, you could argue most economic systems in history have kind of been debt-based.
[02:42:06.771 --> 02:42:21.378]  There are some anomalies that don't fit that example, but especially in the last hundred years with what Quigley talked about in Tragedy and Hope, the bank and elite were really the ones that set the stage and ran the show, you could say, for the 20th century and for the world wars.
[02:42:21.418 --> 02:42:26.201]  And the purpose of the world wars, well, they have many purposes, but one of those purposes is basically in debt.
[02:42:26.721 --> 02:42:31.865]  The other nations to put everyone into debt slavery, and that's the easiest way to control the other countries.
[02:42:32.386 --> 02:42:34.568]  And that's why America has a gigantic debt.
[02:42:34.588 --> 02:42:39.852]  That's why there been so many derivatives bubbles and this kind of stuff that they're really just printing the currency.
[02:42:39.892 --> 02:42:46.578]  They're inflating the currency, destroying the purchasing value on purpose to explode the existing system.
[02:42:47.759 --> 02:43:03.804]  And so my concern is that what they're going to do with the situation in Ukraine is, as we all know, they're going to pin all the blame on Russia, and this can then lead to some sort of wider conflict that the Global Elite could then say, whatever bad happens, it's the fault of Russia, right?
[02:43:03.844 --> 02:43:06.565]   So think of Putin is like the new Trump, right?
[02:43:06.725 --> 02:43:17.411]  And it doesn't matter whether you liked or don't like Trump, he's being put forward as this global Trump figure now that is the basis for any wild thing that will occur.
[02:43:17.471 --> 02:43:25.636]  Cyber-polygon, you know they're going to blame, well, Russian hackers have cyber-polygon attacked everywhere, you know, America's power grid is shut down because Putin, right?
[02:43:26.216 --> 02:43:37.080]  And, at the same time, we can read these documents like the NATO Cognitive Warfare Strategy, right, which literally says to mind-control the population of the world.
[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:48.944]  That's what the NATO Cognitive Warfare... the people doing the stuff in Ukraine, right, NATO, right, their Cognitive Warfare Strategy says brainwash the population as the... that's your enemy target.
[02:43:49.719 --> 02:43:55.461]  Tell anybody in the populations of the world that disagree with the official narratives that they're now terrorists.
[02:43:55.921 --> 02:43:56.641]  That's what it says.
[02:43:57.001 --> 02:43:58.782]  You disagree, you're a terrorist.
[02:43:59.242 --> 02:44:04.504]  The nation states must enact policies that reflect this NATO position.
[02:44:05.324 --> 02:44:08.365]  And by the way, this was what the Canadian government was using.
[02:44:08.385 --> 02:44:11.766]  They were using the NATO Cognitive Warfare Strategy document.
[02:44:12.845 --> 02:44:16.867]  For scaring the crap out of everybody into accepting all the CUFID measures.
[02:44:17.047 --> 02:44:18.608]  The Canadian government openly said that.
[02:44:18.708 --> 02:44:26.051]  We're using the NATO Cognitive Warfare Strategy to scare the crap out of everybody into accepting all the COVID CUFID measures.
[02:44:26.491 --> 02:44:27.292]  And it's not real.
[02:44:27.452 --> 02:44:29.292]  It was a hyped up pandemic.
[02:44:29.473 --> 02:44:33.975]  I'm saying that the fear that all of what they blew out of proportion is not real.
[02:44:33.995 --> 02:44:36.376]  I'm not saying there wasn't any illness.
[02:44:36.416 --> 02:44:37.716]  There were people getting sick, right?
[02:44:38.056 --> 02:44:46.622]   But I'm saying that the The narrative that the Canadian government put out was a completely concocted psychological warfare narrative.
[02:44:47.262 --> 02:44:52.145]  And by design, they said that so that anyone that disagreed with it is now a potential terrorist.
[02:44:52.165 --> 02:44:55.027]  And they're going to do the same thing with this present scenario.
[02:44:55.047 --> 02:44:57.108]  They're already doing it with all the massive censorship.
[02:44:57.469 --> 02:45:07.315]  That if you question the incoherent babble of Western media at all, you're automatically Putin-bot, Putin-shill terrorist, right?
[02:45:09.153 --> 02:45:24.377]  And so the point then again, as Greg Reese put in his report, was that the strategy of when you sign on with NATO is that you now become a debt slave and now you get all of the Western toxic ideology.
[02:45:24.417 --> 02:45:25.617]  That's part of the package deal.
[02:45:26.057 --> 02:45:27.758]  Coke, Pepsi, abortion, vaccines.
[02:45:28.878 --> 02:45:29.078]  Right.
[02:45:30.536 --> 02:45:31.997]  Uh, gender reassignment.
[02:45:32.057 --> 02:45:33.559]  That's all part of the package deal that you get.
[02:45:33.579 --> 02:45:35.260]  If you don't like that, then you're a terrorist.
[02:45:35.340 --> 02:45:46.048]  You see, you see what's happening here is that there's a clear ideological conflict that's being formed because of the logic of Western postmodern imperialism.
[02:45:46.729 --> 02:45:50.952]  It must enforce these, what you could say are basically satanic agendas.
[02:45:51.585 --> 02:45:54.666]  And it's not a question of good guy, bad guy, right?
[02:45:54.686 --> 02:45:56.667]  That doesn't make Putin a good guy.
[02:45:57.187 --> 02:45:59.728]  I view him as a real politician, right?
[02:45:59.748 --> 02:46:02.449]  Like he's a real world politician, much like Trump was.
[02:46:02.889 --> 02:46:04.890]  So Trump did good things, Trump did bad things, right?
[02:46:05.490 --> 02:46:17.474]  But he represents a clash with, even if he's just purely a symbolic figure, of classic Christianity, which cannot admit or affirm those things, you see.
[02:46:18.115 --> 02:46:24.619]  So that's why this is becoming a global conflict, even though it's actually just an area of Ukraine, right?
[02:46:24.639 --> 02:46:27.300]  We're being told now that this could lead to a World War III.
[02:46:27.460 --> 02:46:35.084]  And again, remember Klaus warned us that there will be a cyber pandemic that will come that will dwarf everything that we saw in COVID, right?
[02:46:35.865 --> 02:46:42.668]  And everybody, it's just so clear that if this occurs, we've already seen a bunch of cyber attacks in the last two weeks as a result of this conflict.
[02:46:43.288 --> 02:46:50.554]   If that occurs, There's no, we know, we already know who they're going to say is behind the cyber pandemic.
[02:46:50.574 --> 02:46:51.814]  They're going to say it's Russia, right?
[02:46:52.114 --> 02:46:55.976]  The World Economic Forum just deleted Putin's page from the World Economic Forum.
[02:46:56.316 --> 02:47:01.618]  They condemned his actions as has all the rest of the Anglo-American establishment condemned these actions.
[02:47:02.238 --> 02:47:04.459]  So just expect that if it comes.
[02:47:04.499 --> 02:47:05.339]  I don't know if it's coming.
[02:47:05.359 --> 02:47:06.059]  I have no idea.
[02:47:06.319 --> 02:47:09.020]  I'm just speculating here, but that would be a logical conclusion.
[02:47:09.060 --> 02:47:09.600]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:47:09.620 --> 02:47:10.941]  We're going to get into this further when we come back.
[02:47:11.972 --> 02:47:12.913]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:12.933 --> 02:47:14.595]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:47:14.615 --> 02:47:30.491]  We were discussing the ideological conflict between East and West and how while there were many noble people, sure, that fought, my uncle fought in the Cold War on the side of the West and he was involved in anti-Russian espionage operations.
[02:47:31.131 --> 02:47:46.118]  And so I don't have any, you know, I'm not here as a shill for Putin or anything like that, but the point is that the ethos that a power block has can eventually evolve into something worse and something worse and something even worse, right?
[02:47:46.498 --> 02:48:03.088]   We can have civilizational level collapse, and that's the danger that we're seeing here, that we have a Malthusian elite that pose a danger to the entire world, and I think that Again, setting aside the issue of Putin's motives, Russia at least understands that.
[02:48:03.108 --> 02:48:15.778]  That's why we have the bombing, for example, that was confirmed of these various bio labs that were working on level four dangerous bio warfare release scenarios that could be done potentially against Russia.
[02:48:16.138 --> 02:48:19.501]  That's why those were bombed by Russia.
[02:48:19.521 --> 02:48:43.735]   I even met There's a great analyst, her name's Dilyana, I forget her last name, but she had exposed this some years ago and she has some lectures that you can find on YouTube where she gets into those bio labs that were there and the potential for race-specific bioweapons being created and so that's part of the motivation, right, why those areas were bombed that has now been confirmed.
[02:48:45.375 --> 02:48:53.168]   And so when we learn that type of stuff, that information, Then we start to realize that, well, there's more to this story, right?
[02:48:53.228 --> 02:49:00.015]  It's not just an aggressive madman Putin who, like Rasputin or something, is going crazy and just invading countries.
[02:49:00.035 --> 02:49:02.358]  That's the narrative of the West or the Western media.
[02:49:02.818 --> 02:49:07.363]  And now there's a lot more to this story, and that's what we're trying to do here is get the setting here to get the big picture.
[02:49:07.383 --> 02:49:10.547]  And I'd also like to recommend my good friend Father Peter Hears.
[02:49:11.287 --> 02:49:18.129]  He did a two-hour lecture on his YouTube channel, Orthodox Ethos, from a Christian perspective, kind of giving his take.
[02:49:18.229 --> 02:49:32.012]  And he's not trying to take sides in the sense of good guy, bad guy, but looking at it and saying, hey, when these kinds of wars happen, it's not accidental that this is, in Russia and Ukraine, two countries that have the highest abortion rates, right?
[02:49:32.092 --> 02:49:33.872]  Russia and Ukraine, I think, are in the top ten.
[02:49:34.332 --> 02:49:36.892]  for abortion rates in the world.
[02:49:36.892 --> 02:49:48.332]   And that is partly due to the 100 plus years that they had under Sovietism, under communism, which promoted that idea.
[02:49:48.339 --> 02:49:58.901]  So I'm not trying to blame the existing... I know it takes time to emerge from those dangerous toxic ideologies, and they're still in the process of emerging from that.
[02:49:58.981 --> 02:50:11.183]  But it does look like with, you know, Putin allocating so much money to rebuilding churches, even if it's just symbolic or for show, it's still occurring in a way that the West sees as something that could potentially be a problem.
[02:50:11.203 --> 02:50:22.508]   In fact, many geopolitical strategists From NATO, from the West, have pointed out the danger, so-called, of the Christianity of orthodoxy that is being promoted by Putin.
[02:50:22.548 --> 02:50:25.109]  The danger of orthodoxy in Ukraine.
[02:50:25.129 --> 02:50:35.914]  And that's why the CA, through the Jesuit universities like Fordham, were promoting so much of a counter-church that they set up in the last several years in the Ukraine.
[02:50:35.954 --> 02:50:37.195]  It's known as the Ukraine Schism.
[02:50:37.950 --> 02:50:45.377]  Uh, and you have the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Orthodox Church recognizing these schismatics because he's essentially was told to by the State Department to do this.
[02:50:45.897 --> 02:50:51.242]  So, the State Department and CIA literally set up a fake Orthodox Church in the Ukraine.
[02:50:52.213 --> 02:51:05.863]  And that's partly to split, again, not just the country geopolitically speaking from the influence of Russia, but also to split it ideologically from the influence of Russia, so that it's not under the influence of Orthodox Christianity.
[02:51:06.283 --> 02:51:08.245]  So, there's a lot of problems in those countries.
[02:51:08.285 --> 02:51:13.348]  I'm not trying to set up this idealistic scenario where we have, again, a good guy, bad guy, right?
[02:51:13.368 --> 02:51:16.090]  That's the Marvel, soy boy approach of the West.
[02:51:16.150 --> 02:51:18.312]  All these people on Twitter, they think it's good guy, bad guy.
[02:51:18.712 --> 02:51:20.033]  It's a lot more complicated than that.
[02:51:20.053 --> 02:51:21.895]  You have to know the history of the Cold War.
[02:51:21.915 --> 02:51:24.036]  You have to know books like Tragedy and Hope.
[02:51:24.056 --> 02:51:25.777]  You have to know what Brzezinski talks about.
[02:51:25.817 --> 02:51:40.889]  And Brzezinski, I think in Strategic Vision back in 2012, said that all this would be happening in the Ukraine, that there would be this coup, there would be this takeover in the Ukraine, because again, that is the key to the Eurasian heartland, to control the heartland.
[02:51:41.818 --> 02:51:43.159]  So that's why this is happening.
[02:51:43.199 --> 02:51:44.420]  That's why this is so crucial.
[02:51:44.901 --> 02:51:53.568]  That's why NATO can't let Russia have Ukraine or Moldova or any of those other countries, because that would lead to an influence in Europe.
[02:51:54.008 --> 02:51:58.692]  And it has to be cut off, because that's still the Brzezinski model, the Brzezinski strategy.
[02:51:59.032 --> 02:52:01.314]  Again, echoing that heartland theory of the British Empire.
[02:52:01.334 --> 02:52:02.235]  So that's what's going on.
[02:52:02.967 --> 02:52:16.914]  And again, there's still Russia, if there is an authentic resurgence of Christianity, it's still emerging out of, you know, the hundred years of atheism, communism, you know, there's not a high church attendance in Russia.
[02:52:16.954 --> 02:52:21.316]  It's growing, but it's not like it would have been, you know, prior to the bullshit revolution.
[02:52:22.091 --> 02:52:31.367]  So they're still coming out of this and they're struggling to get out from under the global debt-based style system that looted Russia in the 90s.
[02:52:31.628 --> 02:52:44.190]   If you don't know about this, it was actually Congressional inquiries into when the Soviet Union fell, a lot of the corrupt KGB generals that basically looted the country together with people from Harvard, Larry Summers, and so forth.
[02:52:44.670 --> 02:52:47.892]  They just stole billions of dollars from Russia.
[02:52:47.952 --> 02:52:51.153]  When it collapsed, they put the asset in Yeltsin.
[02:52:51.193 --> 02:52:54.275]  He was a Western asset put in there on purpose to be a puppet.
[02:52:54.655 --> 02:52:57.857]  And so that's why they have struggled for so long.
[02:52:57.897 --> 02:53:07.213]   They've been under this Intense attack and psychological warfare, real warfare, right for the last century from the West, including Bolshevism.
[02:53:07.614 --> 02:53:08.555]  So that's the context.
[02:53:08.575 --> 02:53:13.421]  You have to understand that to really understand the totality that's going on here.
[02:53:14.181 --> 02:53:20.169]  Now, how does this fit into the big picture, as we said, of Great Reset and technocracy and transhumanism?
[02:53:22.358 --> 02:53:30.444]  Klaus in the World Economic Forum, for example, as I said recently, just came out condemning Russia, condemning Putin, condemning all these actions.
[02:53:30.485 --> 02:53:34.708]  And again, I think that's because it's what Russia represents.
[02:53:34.768 --> 02:53:40.472]  It's not because Russia matches up to some perfect Christian society or something like that.
[02:53:40.532 --> 02:53:43.475]  It's the remnants of a Christian civilization and Christendom.
[02:53:44.513 --> 02:53:45.533]  That's still there.
[02:53:46.454 --> 02:53:49.054]  Christendom has basically been completely eradicated.
[02:53:49.074 --> 02:53:54.295]  This ghost of Christianity, you could say, this idea has been completely eradicated from Europe.
[02:53:54.856 --> 02:54:05.118]  It's in the process of being completely eradicated from America, even though mostly, you know, American Christianity is probably Baptist, Evangelical, and the next would be Catholic.
[02:54:05.638 --> 02:54:21.654]  So even that, the remnants of that are quickly being decimated, and that's because the global elites want that, because as we've covered, right, in about 50, 60 writings of the elite, what's the main thing standing in the way to the global technocracy according to the elites?
[02:54:22.295 --> 02:54:22.976]  Christianity.
[02:54:23.056 --> 02:54:25.218]  They all say this across the board.
[02:54:25.894 --> 02:54:48.582]  Because Christianity promotes the idea of family values, being fruitful, having offspring, morals, objective morality, the Ten Commandments, all those things are anathema and a stumbling block, a roadblock to the implementation of a Nietzschean ubermensch top-down technocracy that destroys and kills most of the planet.
[02:54:49.122 --> 02:54:58.288]   The Malthusian ideology is in direct clash ideologically with Just even the most basic ideas of what Christianity is.
[02:54:59.070 --> 02:55:01.197]  Even Evangelical, Catholic, Orthodox, right?
[02:55:01.986 --> 02:55:11.773]  None of those groups can admit the basic principles of what technocratic dialectical materialism and thus it's sort of Luciferian impetus.
[02:55:11.853 --> 02:55:19.198]  I think that really in the background, the real power structure behind the postmodern imperialism is actually Luciferian ideology.
[02:55:19.518 --> 02:55:20.839]  But most people don't believe that.
[02:55:20.879 --> 02:55:26.643]  Maybe just an inner core actually believe that they're going to transcend and unite with computers and become gods, right?
[02:55:26.683 --> 02:55:29.565]  That's the cult of Silicon Valley and the cult of the tech elite.
[02:55:29.825 --> 02:55:30.705]  That's what they believe.
[02:55:30.745 --> 02:55:37.812]   The inner core Of what now represents the Anglo-American establishment, or the post-modern imperium, believes that, I think.
[02:55:37.952 --> 02:55:47.581]  And they thus feel the need and the impetus to implement, globally, the Great Reset, which is the next phase, the starting over.
[02:55:48.141 --> 02:55:48.822]  Who taught that?
[02:55:48.982 --> 02:55:50.323]  The Jacobins, the Illuminists.
[02:55:50.363 --> 02:55:51.424]  That was their philosophy.
[02:55:51.444 --> 02:55:53.246]  They even had in their calendar, Year Zero.
[02:55:53.646 --> 02:56:01.722]   Because for the revolutionary Illuminists in the French Revolution, You have to destroy the existing Christian culture, right?
[02:56:01.782 --> 02:56:03.843]  It's not a question of whether it was a perfect Christian culture.
[02:56:03.863 --> 02:56:04.603]  They don't care about that.
[02:56:05.204 --> 02:56:12.047]  Anything that has the ghosts and remnants of Christianity must be destroyed to start over with a great reset.
[02:56:12.107 --> 02:56:13.408]  And that's literally what they did.
[02:56:13.448 --> 02:56:17.370]  If you want to understand Klaus and these people, they're not really communists.
[02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:21.512]  They might utilize communist ideology and philosophy, but they're all like super rich.
[02:56:23.163 --> 02:56:27.608]  But isn't it funny that super wealthy people always adopt these communist socialist philosophies?
[02:56:27.628 --> 02:56:28.129]  Why is that?
[02:56:28.910 --> 02:56:30.572]  Because it's a control mechanism, that's why.
[02:56:30.592 --> 02:56:34.556]  It's a system of control, browbeating people, and ultimately depopulating.
[02:56:35.117 --> 02:56:43.887]  So they have the Malthusian ideology combined with the revolutionary ethos of the Illuminists, the Year Zero guys, right, the Jacobins.
[02:56:45.251 --> 02:57:11.379]  Combined with Malthus, combined with Darwinism, combined with tech, and that is just a recipe for disaster, and it cannot but lead to, I know I don't want there to be a world war, but it doesn't seem to me how it cannot lead to that, due to the logic of that system, that there must be this ideological clash between something that is purely satanic and something that is not fully, perfectly Christian, but at least just the remnants of Christianity, you could say.
[02:57:12.199 --> 02:57:16.201]   And that's why it's a global conflict between Spiritual ideologists.
[02:57:16.281 --> 02:57:21.562]  Go watch Father Hears' lecture on the reasons for war and go subscribe to my lecture.
[02:57:21.622 --> 02:57:30.424]  Watch that lecture on postmodern imperialism and the ideological predecessors to the present crisis, where I go deeper into this.
[02:57:31.004 --> 02:57:33.484]  So, if you want to get my books, you can go to JasonAlsos.com.
[02:57:33.844 --> 02:57:34.904]  You can subscribe there.
[02:57:34.944 --> 02:57:40.445]  You can get in the shop signed copies of my books, where I cover film symbolism and how all this comes up in movies.
[02:57:40.805 --> 02:57:44.644]  and also support the show here, InfoWars.com.
[02:57:44.644 --> 02:57:47.564]  (electronic music)
[02:57:47.564 --> 02:57:54.765]  (electronic music)
[02:57:54.765 --> 02:58:04.565]   Brain force in the liquid form is even superior than the old brain force capsules.
[02:58:04.654 --> 02:58:05.855]  This is a great product.
[02:58:06.035 --> 02:58:08.636]  I used it when I worked as a correspondent in InfoWars.
[02:58:08.676 --> 02:58:10.116]  That's kind of when I discovered it.
[02:58:10.276 --> 02:58:11.897]  I've never been without it.
[02:58:11.977 --> 02:58:20.361]  And the reason I like it is it doesn't give you that jumpy, ramped up feeling that Ephedrine does and all the products that include some form of Ephedrine.
[02:58:20.480 --> 02:58:26.640]   You can take this stuff, you can get a burst of energy to write a column or to create a video
[02:58:26.640 --> 02:58:29.880]   or to do whatever work you have to do, and then you can sleep.
[02:58:29.880 --> 02:58:33.239]  Your brain doesn't bounce around like a baby in a boxcar.
[02:58:33.239 --> 02:58:36.319]  So I highly recommend BrainForce.
[02:58:36.319 --> 02:58:38.680]  I really like the new liquid formula.
[02:58:38.680 --> 02:58:43.240]   I find it superior because the absorption is immediate and it works.
[02:58:43.240 --> 02:58:44.560]  It's a subtle lift.
[02:58:44.555 --> 02:58:51.159]  You don't feel jolted, but now you felt too tired to write that email or to record that video.
[02:58:51.239 --> 02:58:54.702]  Now suddenly you've got not only the creative energy, but the physical energy.
[02:58:54.762 --> 02:58:56.843]  So I can't say enough about this product.
[02:58:56.923 --> 02:58:59.585]  And Alex, I'm not compensated to say any of this.
[02:59:00.125 --> 02:59:03.428]  So no, we don't have some secret deal where Stone will plug our products.
[02:59:03.608 --> 02:59:07.128]   No, I'm saying this because it's true and for no other reason.
[02:59:07.128 --> 02:59:08.128]  And also...
[02:59:08.128 --> 02:59:11.287]   I got to interrupt you, I have plenty of time next hour, but it's funny you raised this.
[02:59:11.287 --> 02:59:17.207]   Last time you just brought up off air how much you liked one of the products and the
[02:59:17.207 --> 02:59:20.368]  iodine and then I said, well, you ought to say that on air.
[02:59:20.368 --> 02:59:21.647]  So we came back, you said it.
[02:59:21.647 --> 02:59:24.007]  They made a huge, like it was a scandal.
[02:59:24.007 --> 02:59:25.888]  You promoted the iodine product.
[02:59:25.888 --> 02:59:28.368]  They tried to say that I'm somehow selling quackery.
[02:59:28.298 --> 02:59:33.097]   Iodine is indisputably extremely value in terms of boosting natural immunity.
[02:59:33.097 --> 02:59:34.858]  There's no dispute about that.
[02:59:34.858 --> 02:59:39.897]   All I was pointing out was that the iodine product sold at InfoWars is of the highest
[02:59:39.897 --> 02:59:40.897]  quality.
[02:59:40.897 --> 02:59:44.778]   I mean, I bought iodine down at, you know, the vitamin shop and I've ordered it on Amazon
[02:59:44.778 --> 02:59:49.698]   as much as I hate giving Jeff Bezos a penny, but it's not of the quality that you can get
[02:59:49.698 --> 02:59:50.698]  at InfoWars.
[02:59:51.677 --> 02:59:57.360]  They make it sound like this is some kind of hucksterism or that I'm somehow compensated to push these products.
[02:59:57.400 --> 03:00:03.923]  No, I said it because I'd just gotten over the Chinese virus and I was at the point where all I had left was this nagging cough.
[03:00:04.003 --> 03:00:07.945]  Thanks to ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, I had a quick recovery.
[03:00:08.065 --> 03:00:10.606]  That'll ensure that we're banned everywhere, just that I mentioned those.
[03:00:11.226 --> 03:00:13.907]  And I talked about the quality of the product.
[03:00:14.046 --> 03:00:15.046]  It's a joke.
[03:00:15.046 --> 03:00:26.046]  [Music]
[03:00:26.046 --> 03:00:34.046]   Rarely are people confronted or presented with a real 360 win or a non-zero sum game.
[03:00:34.084 --> 03:00:34.786]  But I can tell you...
[03:00:35.933 --> 03:00:42.495]  Getting high quality, storable food from the top company in the United States that's ready to ship to you as a 360 win.
[03:00:43.015 --> 03:00:47.396]  We are in a total inflationary environment for the next 5-10 years in my view.
[03:00:48.036 --> 03:00:50.997]  The globalists are devaluing all the major world currencies.
[03:00:51.477 --> 03:00:52.477]  Well, how do you get ahead of that?
[03:00:52.757 --> 03:00:55.798]  Well, you can buy real estate, but still you got to pay property taxes on that.
[03:00:55.818 --> 03:00:57.039]  There's a lot of problems.
[03:00:57.099 --> 03:00:58.119]  It's not easy to offload.
[03:00:59.090 --> 03:01:05.795]  But with things like high-quality, affordable food that's packaged very, very well, that lasts more than a decade, it's insurance you can eat.
[03:01:06.116 --> 03:01:12.180]  And by buying food now, you get around the inflation because, again, the food doesn't cost more in the future.
[03:01:13.001 --> 03:01:15.303]  My Patriot Supply is the biggest company in the U.S.
[03:01:15.792 --> 03:01:20.431]   after only 15 years in business because of great quality and very low prices ready to ship.

[03:01:44.573 --> 03:01:47.471]  getting it early so you beat inflation.
[03:01:47.675 --> 03:01:48.996]  A true 360 win.
[03:01:49.596 --> 03:01:56.903]  On the preparedness checklist, having high-quality, storable food is right up there at the top with self-defense, water, and transportation.
[03:01:57.264 --> 03:02:02.248]  So, take care of that box now as the world goes into this deepening Great Reset crisis.
[03:02:02.589 --> 03:02:03.530]  Fund the Info War.
[03:02:03.670 --> 03:02:05.431]  Beat inflation all at one spot.
