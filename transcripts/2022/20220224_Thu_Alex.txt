[00:00.000 --> 00:29.980]  Well, we don't have to come in with our own canned air-raid
[00:29.980 --> 00:38.520]  sirens from during the Cold War. We got real air-raid sirens in 2022. As thousands of bombs
[00:38.520 --> 00:46.780]  get dropped on military targets across the birthplace of the Slavic people's Ukraine.
[00:46.780 --> 00:53.300]  Russia jealously does not want, towards Soros, to have it for himself, so Russia's grabbing
[00:53.300 --> 01:01.300]  it. That's the reality of what's going on. That's what Putin's been saying. According
[01:01.300 --> 01:05.020]  to the UN and others, he's a war criminal. That's something you've got to decide, but
[01:05.020 --> 01:12.980]  here's the bottom line. I don't play this video from October of last year because I
[01:12.980 --> 01:19.700]  want to toot my horn. I play it because I came on air and told you that I had three
[01:19.700 --> 01:27.060]  different sources, one at the very top of corporate world, one at the top of media,
[01:27.060 --> 01:32.940]  and one, well, several actually, in intelligence that are real people, not little leftist analyst
[01:32.940 --> 01:37.460]  types that sit around and pretend they're involved in policy. And the word I got was
[01:37.460 --> 01:46.260]  if you know what you're doing, you need to warn people that late January into February,
[01:46.260 --> 01:50.340]  Russia's going to move and China's going to move. And China is openly talking about
[01:50.340 --> 01:54.060]  moving into Hong Kong and Taiwan, an even stronger way right now.
[01:54.060 --> 01:59.900]  But let's just start the broadcast here now that Putin has invaded Ukraine. Is he just
[01:59.900 --> 02:03.980]  taking out the military targets so far? But will he continue to ratchet up? That's the
[02:03.980 --> 02:12.780]  formula. That's how the U.S. does it. That's how Hitler did it. That's how you inchworm
[02:12.780 --> 02:17.380]  take over a population in war. You never tell people what you're really planning to do.
[02:17.380 --> 02:21.780]  You're going to get the inside scoop, the best analysis there is out there. You can
[02:21.780 --> 02:26.500]  read the New York Times. They say Biden's done a great job. This is wonderful. You can
[02:26.500 --> 02:32.180]  tune in to the BBC and hear that Putin's the new Hitler. Or you can tune in here and actually
[02:32.180 --> 02:36.100]  really understand the history of things and make your own decision about where all this
[02:36.100 --> 02:40.540]  is going. But all hell is breaking loose. So here's a few clips of yours truly back
[02:40.540 --> 02:44.380]  in October and November of last year.
[02:44.380 --> 02:50.220]  Well, you're not just here talking about what they've already done to us. We must ask ourselves,
[02:50.220 --> 02:54.780]  how would they carry out such a mass extermination operation that's already killed millions worldwide
[02:54.780 --> 03:06.020]  with these deadly shots that are soft-kill binary weapons? How would they get away with
[03:06.020 --> 03:14.700]  this? And the answer is a massive financial collapse, a war. And so you got the IMF saying
[03:14.700 --> 03:18.780]  imminent global financial collapse. They've never talked like that. That means they're
[03:18.780 --> 03:23.300]  obviously trying to trigger that. And, oh, imminent cyber attack. Oh, an imminent war
[03:23.300 --> 03:31.140]  with Russia. So I guess China can then swoop into Taiwan, Hong Kong. They already got Hong
[03:31.140 --> 03:39.660]  Kong, the South China Sea. They're saying they own part of Vietnam now. And I don't
[03:39.660 --> 03:46.180]  want a war. But we're looking at a giant war in February right now. Currently, that's the
[03:46.180 --> 03:51.660]  projections with the top people on the earth who claim they're not with the new World Order
[03:51.660 --> 04:00.260]  Combine is war in February. And this is the type of time like right before World War One,
[04:00.260 --> 04:06.860]  not before World War Two, when everything kicks off. And I hope that doesn't happen.
[04:06.860 --> 04:17.940]  But currently, that is the trajectory we're on. And there is a consensus on that. And
[04:17.940 --> 04:21.780]  of course, there's hours of that type of stuff out there. That's just what people on Twitter
[04:21.780 --> 04:26.100]  found. I'm going to have our archive is actually dig through and get the full context. I probably
[04:26.100 --> 04:33.180]  talked about it 15 times or so since October and November through December. So there you
[04:33.180 --> 04:38.460]  go. And we've got some very interesting leak documents that China confirms are real about
[04:38.460 --> 04:44.420]  what they're planning to do. This is just insane. And then the biggest COVID news, it's
[04:44.420 --> 04:49.740]  always getting bigger. This is the biggest by a long shot. I mean, by light years, it
[04:49.740 --> 04:55.340]  just I can hardly even hit my mind around the incredible information we've got on that
[04:55.340 --> 05:04.620]  front. Stay with us. I've been on air more than 25 years. And long before I started selling
[05:04.620 --> 05:12.100]  high quality vitamin D3 eight years ago, I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3 because
[05:12.100 --> 05:16.820]  it is essential. And if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're
[05:16.820 --> 05:21.940]  black or white or Hispanic, it doesn't matter. Your body will be susceptible and wide open
[05:21.940 --> 05:26.020]  to so many of the threats are out there. It's just like you need oxygen. You died four minutes
[05:26.020 --> 05:31.100]  without oxygen. You die in five or six days without water. You died a month without food.
[05:31.100 --> 05:36.180]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that
[05:36.180 --> 05:40.180]  you need. And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health
[05:40.180 --> 05:45.860]  is vitamin D3. We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boost all
[05:45.860 --> 05:53.340]  your body's defenses available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com. Everybody, old,
[05:53.340 --> 05:57.420]  young, black, white, you need vitamin D3. This is the best quality out there and it
[05:57.420 --> 06:16.620]  funds the info war 50% off big brother mainstream media government coverups you want to stop
[06:16.620 --> 06:27.580]  tyranny. Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones. Whoever
[06:27.580 --> 06:31.900]  tries to interfere with us and even more so to create threats for our country, our people
[06:31.900 --> 06:36.060]  should know that Russia's responsible be immediate and will lead you to such consequences that
[06:36.060 --> 06:44.340]  you have never experienced in your history. Now, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelinsky,
[06:44.340 --> 06:50.420]  he went on Facebook again to address the nation. He says he's imposing martial law that urged
[06:50.420 --> 06:57.820]  the country not to panic. Today, each of you should stay calm. Stay at home if you can.
[06:57.820 --> 07:03.460]  We are working. The army is working. The whole sector of defense and security is working.
[07:03.460 --> 07:08.980]  No panic. We are strong. We are ready for everything. We will win over everybody because
[07:08.980 --> 07:27.020]  we are Ukraine. All right, ladies and gentlemen, I have not yet written today's headline because
[07:27.020 --> 07:30.420]  I've been so busy during the next break. I'm going to go out there and write it for the
[07:30.420 --> 07:36.540]  show of you every day. But it's important to think about what is the big headline today.
[07:36.540 --> 07:46.380]  What is emblematic here? Well, Russia has called the globalist bluff, ladies and gentlemen,
[07:46.380 --> 07:51.420]  and of course, this whole thing is very incestuous. The whole Russian system is deeply involved
[07:51.420 --> 08:03.300]  with the globalist and their sorrows forces are deeply entwined with every major nation
[08:03.300 --> 08:09.940]  on earth. When I say sorrows forces, it's his foundations that have the arm out of the
[08:09.940 --> 08:13.820]  Bilderberg group that actually try to overthrow the governments with the velvet revolutions.
[08:13.820 --> 08:19.660]  So when I say sorrows, he's more just an archetype of what we're discussing here. There's so
[08:19.660 --> 08:28.140]  many angles and so many ways to look at this. I really want to open the phones up today early
[08:28.140 --> 08:34.140]  in this hour, specifically on your view of what's happening and what you think is coming
[08:34.140 --> 08:38.380]  next here on the Alex Jones show. And I know Owen Schreuer is going to be covering this
[08:38.380 --> 08:45.700]  in depth very, very intensely today. We'll be doing special reports and more at infowars.com
[08:45.700 --> 08:52.540]  as it's needed. And we'll also be hosting Saturday live show at a special Sunday, six
[08:52.540 --> 08:58.500]  hour live show that we're going to be doing this Sunday. And that's going to be again,
[08:58.500 --> 09:06.340]  kicking off at 4pm central standard time and going up until 10 o'clock at night because
[09:06.340 --> 09:13.860]  CNN is running it every, get that clip ready please, 18 seconds. CNN is running this promo
[09:13.860 --> 09:20.380]  every break. And the only time CNN has viewers is during an election or during a war. So
[09:20.380 --> 09:24.620]  they've gone from the lowest ratings I've ever had to their ratings are quite high right
[09:24.620 --> 09:33.980]  now. And why would you be running promos about Alex Jones being the devil every single break?
[09:33.980 --> 09:38.300]  I got told by folks, it's every single break. So I did something I never do. I went tuned
[09:38.300 --> 09:44.300]  over to CNN this morning. And the first time they went to break, it was Alex Jones, the
[09:44.300 --> 09:51.980]  devil. And what does that tell you? I mean, that is the mouth of the New World Order demonizing
[09:51.980 --> 09:57.680]  me. Why is that happening? But we know why they're putting massive pressure behind the
[09:57.680 --> 10:04.220]  scenes for the Justice Department to indict me for something. And they've had, you know,
[10:04.220 --> 10:09.540]  obviously the FBI and the rest of it up our rear ends. And I mean, we're as clean as a
[10:09.540 --> 10:13.900]  whistle, obviously. That's just how I've been my whole life. A straight shoe. There's nothing
[10:13.900 --> 10:20.980]  going on here. I don't take drugs. I don't even speed in my car. We're just above board
[10:20.980 --> 10:27.140]  American patriots. But they're running all these promos about how I'm a threat to America
[10:27.140 --> 10:34.100]  in or twined with war with Russia. So Russia's the enemy and Alex Jones is the enemy. And
[10:34.100 --> 10:38.740]  this is just an incredible scythe. And I'm told they've turned the promos up attacking
[10:38.740 --> 10:45.980]  me. Not just this little short one, but others. More now that this war garbage started in
[10:45.980 --> 10:51.780]  the last 48 hours. So just pray for us, ladies and gentlemen, because CNN is a shadow of
[10:51.780 --> 10:57.220]  its former self. It's a horrible organization. It oversees censorship and control. But when
[10:57.220 --> 11:02.700]  it is salivating like circling sharks, like I'm going to raft and there's like shark fins
[11:02.700 --> 11:08.700]  everywhere around it with CNN on the side. And Brian Stelter hopping around like a demonic
[11:08.700 --> 11:14.980]  Humpty Dumpty. It's just very creepy. Absolutely creepy. And I know it's in the piece because
[11:14.980 --> 11:18.420]  they sent me a bunch of questions that I refuse to answer or be part of, you know, actually
[11:18.420 --> 11:22.380]  talking to them because they twist anything you say. So I'm going to talk to the January
[11:22.380 --> 11:26.940]  6th committee because there's no honor amongst thieves. These people want to set me up. They
[11:26.940 --> 11:30.900]  want to put me in prison. They know I'm innocent. They know I didn't want January 6th to happen.
[11:30.900 --> 11:36.540]  But it's this whole piece about how I'm a threat and I've got to be thrown in jail. And then
[11:36.540 --> 11:41.220]  they go and create a fake origin story because I know who went and did it, John Ronson, with
[11:41.220 --> 11:50.300]  just 100% whole cloth made up garbage. And again, they do that before they whack you.
[11:50.300 --> 11:54.060]  They want to shut somebody up and then they want to have the fake origin story and destroy
[11:54.060 --> 11:58.220]  somebody. But I know we're going to win in the end. And I trust in God and God is way
[11:58.220 --> 12:04.540]  more powerful than these people. But I'm not stupid. And just like I predicted the war
[12:04.540 --> 12:10.580]  in February, I need your prayers. I'm going to continue on a more hardcore than ever.
[12:10.580 --> 12:14.980]  But this is just becoming ridiculous. I mean, at this point, it's freaking, I mean, they
[12:14.980 --> 12:21.700]  attacked me in hundreds of newspapers a day, dozens of TV shows a day, national shows every
[12:21.700 --> 12:28.260]  week. I can't even keep track of it. It's just everywhere. Alex Jones is Satan because
[12:28.260 --> 12:35.140]  they see me as a representation of everything they hate about America, a strong, honorable
[12:35.140 --> 12:40.380]  man who's a father who believes in freedom and has rallied the people and has survived
[12:40.380 --> 12:46.140]  their attacks for decades. And they think if we can just destroy him and steal his identity
[12:46.140 --> 12:52.580]  once we've killed him or put him in prison, then we can somehow defeat you. You see, they
[12:52.580 --> 12:56.580]  see me as you. That's something Trump always said is they want to get through me to get
[12:56.580 --> 13:02.380]  to you. They hate you. They're your enemy. They're at war with you. It is absolutely
[13:02.380 --> 13:08.260]  true. Yeah, yeah, now they're harassing Joe Rogan because of his association with me.
[13:08.260 --> 13:12.820]  The Democrat lawyers that basically all like own the Sandy Hook people are now trying to
[13:12.820 --> 13:19.700]  suck him in. It's stalking. It's Democrat Party, deep state stalking of everyone. And
[13:19.700 --> 13:24.980]  all I want is a good, just society and to not have a bunch of wars and to go to space
[13:24.980 --> 13:31.380]  and to have a system based on honorable competition, but not competition that's so insane. You
[13:31.380 --> 13:35.700]  know, you kill your competition and I just want to stay out of a feudalist nightmare
[13:35.700 --> 13:41.900]  and I just love you and I'm genuine and I'm teleprompter free and they know it. So we've
[13:41.900 --> 13:47.020]  been through a lot together and I appreciate you all. I'm going to come back and hit all
[13:47.020 --> 13:53.980]  the news and take calls and more, but it is definitely two minutes to midnight, both on
[13:53.980 --> 13:58.660]  the case of nuclear war, but also the end of all of our speech and the global casual
[13:58.660 --> 14:06.220]  society coming in. And we are going through the birthing pains right now of something
[14:06.220 --> 14:12.580]  really nasty that's about to come on the scene. But remember, you're all going to die anyways.
[14:12.580 --> 14:18.060]  What matters is how you act and how you behave now in front of God and in front of your families.
[14:18.060 --> 14:23.220]  And so it's a spiritual fight. The most important thing is changing the soul. The most important
[14:23.220 --> 14:28.220]  thing is people realizing God's real and the devil's real. And that choice is eternal.
[14:28.220 --> 14:32.900]  That's everything. Everything else doesn't matter. Not the wrinkles in your face or
[14:32.900 --> 14:39.580]  are you overweight or are you losing your house? All that is nothing. Oh, your car broke
[14:39.580 --> 14:44.500]  down. Your car is a piece of crap. Who cares? You're made by God. You're amazing. Opening
[14:44.500 --> 14:49.180]  that channel up with communion with the Holy Spirit takes you to the next level and then
[14:49.180 --> 14:53.980]  nothing else matters. And then everything else will flow from that. We're a rich, wealthy,
[14:53.980 --> 14:58.940]  powerful society because we were a little Christian and the blessings were just like
[14:58.940 --> 15:03.260]  torrents on us. And then now we left God and like you flip a light switch, the blessings
[15:03.260 --> 15:11.740]  gone and we're ruled by evil demonic creatures like Pelosi and Biden, who are emblematic
[15:11.740 --> 15:17.140]  of the rotting, collapsing, satanic world government. And that's the archetype of evil leaders.
[15:17.140 --> 15:24.340]  They're like skexies in the dark crystal. Now that's a fictional science fiction film.
[15:24.340 --> 15:31.060]  This is the real world with real skexies that want to subconsciously take you with them
[15:31.060 --> 15:36.100]  because they know they're already dead on the inside. We've got Pelosi calling Ukraine
[15:36.100 --> 15:41.900]  a totally different country. When we come back, I shouldn't laugh. It's so damn dangerous.
[15:41.900 --> 15:47.660]  These are the people in command of the nuclear weapons. Just remember that. All right, ladies
[15:47.660 --> 16:00.780]  and gentlemen, we'll be back in full wars.com tomorrow's news today. I've been on air more
[16:00.780 --> 16:07.540]  than 25 years. And long before I started selling high quality vitamin D three eight years ago,

[18:16.100 --> 18:21.220]  go and what you do. So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you
[18:21.220 --> 18:26.740]  down protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts,
[18:26.740 --> 18:31.140]  protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount. That's why
[18:31.140 --> 18:36.820]  everybody should visit infowarstore.com. We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant

[18:54.620 --> 19:05.740]  line. It's amazing. The globalist are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[19:05.740 --> 19:10.660]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food. It's all come out and they're doing
[19:10.660 --> 19:15.420]  that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the creator and we
[19:15.420 --> 19:21.180]  are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that
[19:21.180 --> 19:27.860]  famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy. Is it true? The
[19:27.860 --> 19:34.860]  propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless. They need all their propaganda
[19:34.860 --> 19:41.140]  and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know
[19:41.140 --> 19:45.860]  we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser.
[19:45.860 --> 19:50.340]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars on the air now more than ever
[19:50.340 --> 19:54.380]  because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalist are manifesting and setting
[19:54.380 --> 19:59.180]  up is safe and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they
[19:59.180 --> 20:06.380]  just announced leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex
[20:06.380 --> 20:32.380]  Jones. I don't want to set the world on fire. I just want to start a flame in your heart.
[20:32.380 --> 20:49.340]  In my heart I have but one desire. Will we destroy ourselves like the mythical continent
[20:49.340 --> 20:58.140]  of Atlantis? Because whether Atlantis existed or not, we are now the new Atlantis. The whole
[20:58.140 --> 21:04.460]  world, an island in deep space orbiting a standard star two-thirds the way out of the
[21:04.460 --> 21:15.380]  spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy. Here we are my friends, plunging into infinity, blasting
[21:15.380 --> 21:25.020]  off into eternity. Putin's troops raise Russian flag in Ukraine as Z-tanks which have come
[21:25.020 --> 21:36.220]  from the east and O-tanks that come from Belarus enter deeper into the nation. And there is
[21:36.220 --> 21:42.460]  no real resistance because just like the U.S. bought off the Iraqi leadership in Gulf War
[21:42.460 --> 21:48.700]  I and Gulf War II, 90 plus percent of their generals, you see that Putin has already done
[21:48.700 --> 21:53.900]  his work and has already paid off the Ukrainian military and that's why the Russians know
[21:53.900 --> 21:59.220]  they can roll right in and face almost no resistance.
[21:59.220 --> 22:06.020]  Because that's how real war is done. Do you think the French military that actually beat
[22:06.020 --> 22:10.140]  the Germans in World War I, I mean they were the main army, the Brits were the second army,
[22:10.140 --> 22:16.340]  the Russians were the third army, the U.S. was a late, very small contingent, only came
[22:16.340 --> 22:22.900]  in the last year and a half. Do you think the French just gave up in ten days when Hitler
[22:22.900 --> 22:33.100]  invaded in 1940? No. He bought off the entire French command and they were given dictatorship
[22:33.100 --> 22:40.180]  of France and moved their headquarters to Vici for the next five years. And that's how
[22:40.180 --> 22:49.940]  war is done. You buy off your enemy before battle and then you just blow up some troops
[22:49.940 --> 22:57.860]  in their foxholes and declare victory. And Putin is taking Ukraine. He denied it, they
[22:57.860 --> 23:02.660]  denied it, they claimed, oh, we're just going to protect these zones and then, oh, we're
[23:02.660 --> 23:09.420]  just going to route out the Nazis, which, I mean, how's the left side out of that? Yeah,
[23:09.420 --> 23:15.260]  both sides calling each other Hitler, a political party of socialists that hasn't been around
[23:15.260 --> 23:22.900]  in 75 years. Except in Ukraine, I mean, it was Nazi affiliated groups from the old fissures
[23:22.900 --> 23:30.500]  of World War II when Ukraine was taken over by the Nazis that are actually in partial
[23:30.500 --> 23:37.220]  parliamentary power there. They actually do the Hitler salutes and everything in parliament.
[23:37.220 --> 23:42.180]  So it's pretty wild stuff, ladies and gentlemen. It's like gangs, it's like the Mongols and
[23:42.180 --> 23:48.580]  the Hell's Angels. These beefs just go on and on and on and on and on and on. And Soros
[23:48.580 --> 23:53.220]  in the West, we're backing the Nazis. But that's not the whole Ukrainian groups that
[23:53.220 --> 23:57.340]  were against the Russians. It's about 50-50 in the numbers of who wants to be ally with
[23:57.340 --> 24:02.340]  the Euro, who wants to be ally with Russia. But Russia said, hey, you're Slavic. You founded
[24:02.340 --> 24:09.340]  Russia. We want you because Ukraine's always been the good part of town for what is the
[24:09.340 --> 24:17.060]  Russian Empire. It's mama. And they're not going to let George Soros have mama. And
[24:17.060 --> 24:27.180]  so that's what's happening. Again, Russia was founded in Ukraine. And there's all these
[24:27.180 --> 24:32.540]  memes of Hitler loving Putin. But the truth is, it was Hitler took over Ukraine in World
[24:32.540 --> 24:36.940]  War II and then the Russians pushed it and took it back and then killed probably a half
[24:36.940 --> 24:41.260]  million people in firing squads that they thought were associated with the Nazis. And
[24:41.260 --> 24:45.500]  that kind of pissed off a lot of Ukrainians when, you know, dad, mom get lined up and
[24:45.500 --> 24:49.580]  shot. So, and Putin apologized for that four or five days ago in that big address that
[24:49.580 --> 24:55.260]  we aired. He said, I know that the Soviets in World War II after that really killed a
[24:55.260 --> 24:59.140]  lot of people and did a lot of bad things. And I apologize for the communist. And you
[24:59.140 --> 25:03.220]  want to decommunize stuff? We're about to really decommunize it because Lenin gave
[25:03.220 --> 25:09.820]  Ukraine away from Russia, and we're not doing it. Because like Ukraine is like the head
[25:09.820 --> 25:17.860]  of Russia. Moscow is what came in in the 1300s and saved what was really Russia from
[25:17.860 --> 25:22.820]  the Huns. But listen, I'm not going to go into a history lesson here for anybody and
[25:22.820 --> 25:26.820]  I'm not defending what the Russians are doing or what Biden's doing. I'm just giving people
[25:26.820 --> 25:34.420]  a historical basis of what's really going on here. But that's why you're not seeing any
[25:34.420 --> 25:44.700]  real Ukrainian resistance because it was all for show. And the comedian Hollywood president
[25:44.700 --> 25:54.340]  was a double agent the whole time. Oh, yeah. That's what all the smart money is on. That's
[25:54.340 --> 26:02.540]  what all the experts I know, and I'm an expert myself. No. And so Putin's fighting a war
[26:02.540 --> 26:10.700]  he already won before he pulled the trigger. And that's why we're info wars.com tomorrow's
[26:10.700 --> 26:18.900]  news today. And that's how Biden and the globalist got out maneuvered completely. Trump was smart.
[26:18.900 --> 26:24.140]  He said, no, we're not shipping tow missiles and anti tank missiles in Russia will invade
[26:24.140 --> 26:28.740]  and take it over. Let's just leave it and have it be an economic development zone and
[26:28.740 --> 26:32.260]  free for all just like he told Kim Jong-un. Let's just build condos on the beach and build
[26:32.260 --> 26:36.460]  casinos, dude. Why do you have people in slave camps? You can be running a giant Las Vegas.
[26:36.460 --> 26:44.620]  Look at the 800 miles of incredible coastline. You've got dumb ass. Of course, the Chinese
[26:44.620 --> 26:49.140]  control North Korea. They won't let Kim Jong-un do that on was like slobbering wanting to do
[26:49.140 --> 26:54.580]  that. Oh, you mean I could we move the U. S. I could I could be a billionaire. Yeah. Yeah.
[26:54.580 --> 27:01.900]  Yeah. Sorry. Can't do that. And that's what drop was saying is, Oh, no, we're gonna. We're
[27:01.900 --> 27:05.380]  gonna do deals with everybody. That's how we're gonna. That's how you conquer the world.
[27:05.380 --> 27:10.380]  But see, globalist forces don't want that. They want to be able to shut down the Israeli
[27:10.380 --> 27:14.780]  pipeline, the U. S. pipeline, the Russian pipeline. They've all been shut down the last
[27:14.780 --> 27:24.900]  year. North Stream to the Israeli pipeline out of the Mediterranean. And of course, Keystone.
[27:24.900 --> 27:27.900]  But again, it's not Biden doing it. That's why you've got all these scientists and doctors
[27:27.900 --> 27:33.820]  and White House former top doctors saying that Biden is not fit to deal with this Russia
[27:33.820 --> 27:38.300]  crisis. Of course, he's not dealing with it. He's a puppet. But you ought to ask who's
[27:38.300 --> 27:46.700]  running him. Well, Obama and other forces. So this is extremely dangerous. But make no
[27:46.700 --> 27:57.940]  mistake. The fact that the Russians are taking over all the nuclear power plants and coal
[27:57.940 --> 28:06.660]  power plants and gas plants. And they're taking over the government buildings and the airports.
[28:06.660 --> 28:10.000]  And then some of the military people I know say, yeah, I've seen the footage. It looked
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.980]  like a bunch of young 18 year old Russians, you know, that aren't even special operations
[28:13.980 --> 28:19.100]  dragging rocket launchers around. And no one's opposing them. This looks fake. This isn't
[28:19.100 --> 28:26.860]  a real war. Well, that's because it's all a big drill. The Ukrainian military was bought
[28:26.860 --> 28:35.020]  off. And so now we'll see what happens with their puppet president. A lot of times puppets
[28:35.020 --> 28:41.420]  end up getting hung. We'll see what goes on. But this is all directly because of globalist
[28:41.420 --> 28:47.740]  leftist Western forces. With all their transgenderism and all of their pregnant flight suits and
[28:47.740 --> 28:53.220]  all of their CRT in the military and all this, the entire world thinks we're a complete joke
[28:53.220 --> 29:02.540]  now. And now China is getting ready to invade Taiwan. We'll be right back to life changing
[29:02.540 --> 29:10.780]  life empowering products are now back in stock after being sold out for months and infowarstore.com.

[29:56.620 --> 30:05.980]  infowarstore.com. The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical
[30:05.980 --> 30:13.420]  tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled. They would then use that as the pretext for
[30:13.420 --> 30:19.740]  permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[30:19.740 --> 30:24.860]  But because of so many sciences and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[30:24.860 --> 30:30.620]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[30:30.620 --> 30:37.100]  that it is a world government corporate takeover. And so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[30:37.100 --> 30:42.380]  than ever. The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[30:42.380 --> 30:49.020]  Like Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario and other
[30:49.020 --> 30:53.420]  areas of the world are following suit like Australia. So pray for these folks big time.
[30:53.420 --> 30:59.020]  It's a very serious situation and stay tuned into infowarstore.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[31:00.060 --> 31:05.660]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying
[31:05.660 --> 31:12.060]  empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain. And when it comes to information,
[31:12.060 --> 31:18.540]  boy is that true today. We see the entire global corrupt anti-human depopulation
[31:18.540 --> 31:24.140]  great reset combine trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their their
[31:24.140 --> 31:30.780]  transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and
[31:30.780 --> 31:36.380]  of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID
[31:36.380 --> 31:41.900]  hysteria, their world's gonna end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[31:42.460 --> 31:47.820]  And none of it can succeed. None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[31:47.820 --> 31:53.660]  silenced and gas lit. That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[31:53.660 --> 31:58.380]  And that's why it's hard to share info wars links and band up video links. That's why we've got to
[31:58.380 --> 32:04.140]  share them now more than ever. UN run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the
[32:04.140 --> 32:09.100]  world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking
[32:09.100 --> 32:13.420]  everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases
[32:13.420 --> 32:19.100]  actually taking people away into the night to their facilities. And they're planning in the
[32:19.100 --> 32:24.700]  next year to expand their shield process where they come and take quote healthy people away
[32:24.700 --> 32:29.180]  and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than martial law. And one big
[32:29.180 --> 32:33.580]  thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made
[32:33.580 --> 32:39.820]  here in America and are very compliant, meaning US government military grade at infowarstore.com.

[33:04.300 --> 33:17.900]  the New World Order. It's Alex Jones. Big Brother mainstream media government coverups.
[33:17.900 --> 33:35.180]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[33:35.900 --> 33:42.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. It is Thursday, February 24th,
[33:42.940 --> 33:51.100]  2020. 22 transmission. All hell is breaking loose. Now I'm going to open the phones up next hour
[33:51.100 --> 33:55.740]  into the third hour. And we also have a guest for one segment who's in Ukraine popping in
[33:56.540 --> 34:01.820]  in the third hour. We're going to take a lot of calls second and third hour. I thought I had Roger
[34:01.820 --> 34:05.980]  on middle of the next hour. He's actually on now. That's great. Roger Stone has a lot to say about
[34:05.980 --> 34:11.660]  what's happening in Ukraine with Russia and so much more, but also some big January six news
[34:11.660 --> 34:17.420]  and other news dealing with the ongoing Russia gate garbage. Everything is Russia, Russia, Russia.
[34:17.420 --> 34:25.340]  But listen, when I start the next hour, I cannot be distracted by this Russia thing and then not
[34:25.340 --> 34:34.220]  get to the COVID news. So two big things have happened. One of them is a major German insurance
[34:34.220 --> 34:37.980]  company has come out and confirmed with all these other insurance companies in the US have said
[34:37.980 --> 34:43.420]  40 plus percent death rate from the shots. I mean, this is just story of the century. And then it
[34:43.420 --> 34:50.460]  gets even more insane. Mainline news and mainline scientific universities with the CRISPR gene
[34:50.460 --> 34:59.180]  editing systems have confirmed 100 percent that COVID-19 was weaponized and made in the lab and
[34:59.180 --> 35:08.300]  wait for it is a synthetic gene edited virus. It's all fake. It's all manmade. Just like the head of
[35:08.300 --> 35:13.980]  Pfizer a few weeks ago said, oh, we don't do gain a function now. We scan viruses and then artificially
[35:13.980 --> 35:18.940]  create new ones. So it's like having a synthetic drug before Congress passes a law and the DEA is
[35:18.940 --> 35:24.060]  like, hey, they've changed the molecule. It's the same thing as ecstasy, but we're not allowed to
[35:24.060 --> 35:29.340]  arrest them. Well, they make synthetic viruses and go, hey, it's not from the earth. It's new.
[35:29.340 --> 35:34.060]  We're allowed to have it. That's mainstream news that broke last night.
[35:41.100 --> 35:46.700]  Now, I got a lot to say and a lot to unpack here, but I wanted to get Roger Stone's take on it. But
[35:47.740 --> 35:50.780]  next segment, he'll be with us as well. I'm going to play a clip at Klaus Schwab saying
[35:50.780 --> 35:56.540]  cyber attacks, power outages, and I'm telling you where Putin has miscalculated. I guess he just
[35:56.540 --> 36:01.100]  doesn't care. He's got nuclear weapons is that they're going to cut the power off in areas and pull
[36:01.100 --> 36:06.700]  a bunch of shenanigans and blame it on Putin. You can bet your ass on that. Okay. That is the
[36:06.700 --> 36:11.100]  default move here, a false flag to be blamed on the Russians and the Russians.
[36:12.620 --> 36:17.020]  It looks like taking the bait to me. I would not have done what Putin did. I know he thinks it's
[36:17.020 --> 36:22.060]  their country, their people, it's being taken from them. That's where Russia started was the Ukraine.
[36:22.060 --> 36:26.140]  They're moving weapons in. I get it. But he's looking three, four moves ahead. I'm looking 20
[36:26.140 --> 36:31.820]  ahead and I think it's bad news for the planet. I'm going to stop ranting. Roger Stone, former top
[36:31.820 --> 36:36.540]  Trump advisor, always has the ear of the president. We'll leave it at that. They talk quite a bit and
[36:36.540 --> 36:41.500]  hang out quite a bit there in Florida. He lives right by Marlago and he's got a lot to say about
[36:41.500 --> 36:45.020]  Russia, January 6th and so much more. Roger Stone, thanks for coming almost today.
[36:45.020 --> 36:50.700]  Alex, it's great to be back with you. Well, as we used to say when I was a correspondent for
[36:50.700 --> 36:59.500]  Info Wars, tomorrow's news today. We predicted this a good 10 days ago that the plan to war
[36:59.500 --> 37:07.020]  was inexorable. This was, as I have said previously, entirely avoidable. No, for those folks at
[37:07.020 --> 37:12.380]  Media Matters for America, I'm not an apologist for Putin. I denounced the Russian system. It's
[37:12.380 --> 37:21.260]  a brutal totalitarian system and Putin is a thug. Of that, there is no question. Although I still
[37:21.260 --> 37:26.780]  doubt the narrative of the Biden administration and I noticed a difference between what the Ukrainian
[37:26.780 --> 37:31.740]  government is saying and what the Biden administration is saying. Let me say several things. First of
[37:31.740 --> 37:35.980]  all, this never would have happened if Donald Trump were president because there was a negotiable
[37:35.980 --> 37:40.780]  settlement for world peace and it wouldn't have mattered. It wouldn't have included giving up any
[37:40.780 --> 37:46.060]  of Ukraine to the Russians territorially. Putin has made it very clear from the beginning
[37:46.700 --> 37:52.620]  that his concern was the potential of the presence of Western missiles in Ukraine.
[37:52.620 --> 37:59.180]  When he said, I don't want Ukraine to join NATO, I want assurances, they don't want NATO
[37:59.180 --> 38:05.340]  membership. What he's saying is we don't want Western missiles on our border. This is not
[38:05.340 --> 38:10.780]  different than the position of President John F. Kennedy in 1962 when the Russians put
[38:11.500 --> 38:18.860]  Soviet missiles 90 miles off our shore in Cuba. There was therefore a diplomatic solution.
[38:19.420 --> 38:23.820]  But the Biden administration doesn't want a diplomatic solution. They don't want peace.
[38:23.820 --> 38:28.380]  They don't really care about the integrity of the Ukrainian borders any more than they do
[38:28.380 --> 38:36.460]  the integrity of our southern border. This is about war. War is extremely important, profitable
[38:36.460 --> 38:43.020]  to the deep state and to the Biden administration. And it occurs to me, Alex, the last time there was
[38:43.020 --> 38:50.780]  a Russian invasion of Ukraine in which they took Crimea, it was under Barack Obama, not under
[38:50.780 --> 38:57.340]  Donald Trump. So this is a tragedy that could trigger World War III. The loss of life here
[38:57.340 --> 39:03.340]  could be extraordinary. And the idea that we are going to punish Russia with sanctions
[39:03.340 --> 39:09.420]  is laughable because Joe Biden is propping up their domestic petroleum industry.
[39:09.980 --> 39:16.540]  With oil pushing past 100 a barrel and are dependent on Russian and Saudi oil,
[39:16.540 --> 39:21.660]  he's the one who's rebuilding their economy. He laughs at your sanctions. Your sanctions won't
[39:21.660 --> 39:28.060]  bother him in the slightest. So that is an ineffective response to say the least. Plus,
[39:28.060 --> 39:33.340]  the Biden administration, as you know, removed the sanctions with the support of House Republicans
[39:33.340 --> 39:39.980]  on China only weeks ago. So I think the agenda of the administration is clear.
[39:39.980 --> 39:46.380]  It is war at any price. It is war at any cost. This is an international tragedy.
[39:47.500 --> 39:51.020]  I agree with you, Roger. I know you've been talking to the big man quite a bit lately.
[39:51.020 --> 39:55.100]  And most of that is off record. What can you tell us about President Trump and what his real
[39:55.100 --> 40:01.660]  views are on this? Well, he correctly recognizes this wouldn't happen if he were president,
[40:01.660 --> 40:08.300]  that there was a diplomatic solution. As he said last night, having a dialogue with Putin
[40:08.300 --> 40:14.220]  is not a bad thing. It's a good thing. We both have nuclear weapons. World peace hangs in the
[40:14.220 --> 40:22.780]  balance. And we've been talking past the Russians. Economically, until we propped up their economy,
[40:22.780 --> 40:28.940]  the president points out that they can't afford to sustain Ukraine as a puppet state.
[40:29.740 --> 40:33.580]  What perplexes me every morning when I wake up is watching the New York Post,
[40:33.580 --> 40:38.220]  which has been terrific editorially on the fact that this was a soluble problem,
[40:38.220 --> 40:44.460]  and the Biden administration was basically just beating the war drums as neocons, but now suddenly
[40:44.460 --> 40:51.180]  they've become bloodthirsty too in their front page. So one thing that did bother me and that
[40:51.180 --> 40:57.660]  that was that in one of the so-called unaligned regions where the Russians have already taken
[40:57.660 --> 41:04.140]  control, they're starting to force people of the Jewish faith to register. I don't like that.
[41:04.140 --> 41:09.980]  That bothers me a great deal. Is that real? That is an oppressed report that I read this morning
[41:10.620 --> 41:18.140]  shortly before coming on. I hope that it is incorrect. But again, we are hurtling towards war
[41:18.140 --> 41:27.660]  completely unnecessarily. This is the manifestation of a posture of weakness. It's the whole reason
[41:27.660 --> 41:32.940]  that the Iraqis continue to rain missiles on Israel. It's the reason the North Koreans have
[41:32.940 --> 41:39.420]  restarted their nuclear development program, their weapons development program. It's the reason the
[41:39.420 --> 41:44.940]  Chinese are harassing our ships in the South China Sea. The idea of harassing an American flag
[41:44.940 --> 41:49.740]  shipped in the Pacific would have been out of the question under President Donald Trump.
[41:51.180 --> 41:57.180]  I'm sure that Putin laughs at Biden's claim of sanctions. Sanctions are not going to bother him
[41:57.180 --> 42:03.900]  in the slightest. In fact, at the same time, Biden turns off the Keystone pipe, so we have energy
[42:03.900 --> 42:10.780]  problems, yet he has now green-lighted their pipeline, which had been shut down by Donald Trump.
[42:11.500 --> 42:15.740]  Trump was tougher on the Russians than any president in recent memories.
[42:15.740 --> 42:20.780]  There's a lot of memes out there that show the Russians attacked under Obama and they attacked
[42:22.300 --> 42:24.540]  under Biden, but they didn't attack when Trump was in there.
[42:24.540 --> 42:31.180]  Well, not only that, but that is, of course, the real irony of the whole Russia-Russia-Russia hoax.
[42:31.180 --> 42:36.540]  John Podesta and those around Hillary made millions. Tony Podesta made millions in their
[42:36.540 --> 42:41.900]  sweetheart deals with some of the oligarchs around Russia. If there was anyone in bed
[42:42.620 --> 42:47.820]  with Russia, it was Hillary Clinton. So the idea that Trump would go soft on them or that
[42:47.820 --> 42:53.900]  they favored his candidacy, that's nonsensical. It's false, and now it's been proven false.
[42:53.900 --> 42:55.820]  That's right. Stay right there, Roger Stone.

[45:59.420 --> 46:07.020]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[46:07.020 --> 46:13.100]  until the populations rebelled. They would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[46:13.100 --> 46:19.340]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives. But because
[46:19.340 --> 46:24.860]  of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers,
[46:25.580 --> 46:31.500]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a
[46:31.500 --> 46:36.700]  world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[46:37.260 --> 46:41.980]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover. Like
[46:41.980 --> 46:48.620]  Canada where they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario and other areas of
[46:48.620 --> 46:53.260]  the world are following suit like Australia. So pray for these folks big time. This is a very
[46:53.260 --> 46:58.220]  serious situation and stay tuned into infowarsthone.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[46:58.220 --> 47:11.020]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:28.220 --> 47:33.500]  Got my ass together gonna walk all over you. Get me back my bullets.
[47:36.620 --> 47:39.020]  Put them back where they belong.
[47:42.060 --> 47:46.220]  They ain't fooling around cause I've done had my fun.
[47:46.220 --> 47:59.020]  Ain't gonna see no more damage done. Get me back my bullets.
[47:59.020 --> 48:03.020]  We talking of people that are in me out of town.
[48:04.060 --> 48:06.860]  All right, Roger Stone's riding the shotgun with us a little bit at the next hour that I'm gonna
[48:06.860 --> 48:12.540]  have two hours of up the phones ahead. I'm Paul Joseph Watson and I'm gonna be hanging around
[48:12.540 --> 48:17.020]  here. I'll be on the war room. I'm looking to do some nighttime shows. This is also huge.
[48:17.020 --> 48:24.780]  Russia is invading the whole of Ukraine. Putin has used deception as you do in war and he is
[48:24.780 --> 48:29.340]  now moving into the whole thing. Roger Stone is our guest riding shotgun. Let me just briefly say
[48:29.340 --> 48:35.100]  this. We're only on air after going up against the Democrats, the globalists, the new world order,
[48:35.100 --> 48:39.980]  all of it because of you and I don't spend our time defending ourselves but maybe two percent
[48:39.980 --> 48:44.940]  of the show. I'm not gonna bore you with all the background stuff. We got bigger fish to fry
[48:44.940 --> 48:49.580]  but you want to keep Info Wars on the air. I want to thank you for it and your support has been so
[48:49.580 --> 48:54.700]  amazing. We need more support now plus we got products you really need. X3 is all three types

[49:35.580 --> 49:42.300]  in a few weeks but I just can't with this not sell it at the lowest price I can in 1995 because
[49:42.300 --> 49:47.820]  folks everybody needs this. This is a life and death situation and then fast-acting, amazing,
[49:47.820 --> 49:55.900]  amazing clean energy. We have Brain Force Ultra. Hits you really quick, super clean, amazing
[49:55.900 --> 50:00.540]  neutropic. You got to try it and then goes away in a few hours. This is what I take at 7, 8 at
[50:00.540 --> 50:05.500]  night. If a story breaks or I'm going to do a show or a friend calls, does in town let's go dinner
[50:05.500 --> 50:09.340]  and I'm going to be out until 1 a.m. like I hang out with Joe Rogan probably every week.
[50:09.340 --> 50:14.220]  I'll bam take a dropper of this or hat dropper and I'm good to go but then I don't stay up all night
[50:14.220 --> 50:19.580]  like I took Turbo Force. Turbo Force is something for the morning. Brain Force Plus you can take
[50:19.580 --> 50:23.500]  but you need four hours for you to go to sleep five. This hits in 15 minutes, goes away in about
[50:23.500 --> 50:29.500]  three hours, infowarstore.com. It's 40% off and Roger speaking to you, you're an embattled person.
[50:29.500 --> 50:33.580]  We're going to talk about it next hour. You got some big news on January 6, big news on
[50:34.140 --> 50:37.500]  what you're planning to do to fight back. We're going to talk about that in the next few segments.
[50:37.500 --> 50:42.140]  But getting back to Russia, what is your big picture view on this and where do you think this is going?
[50:43.500 --> 50:49.420]  Well, Alex, first of all, and I'll get criticized for this but I don't really care, Brain Force
[50:49.420 --> 50:56.860]  in the liquid form is even superior than the old Brain Force capsules. This is a great product.
[50:56.860 --> 51:01.660]  I used it when I worked as a correspondent in InfoWars. That's kind of when I discovered it.
[51:01.660 --> 51:07.020]  I've never been without it. And the reason I like it is it doesn't give you that jumpy,
[51:08.220 --> 51:14.140]  ramped up feeling that, you know, that ephedrine does and all the products that include some form
[51:14.140 --> 51:21.020]  of ephedrine. You can take this stuff, you can get a burst of energy to write a column or to
[51:21.020 --> 51:26.700]  create a video or to do whatever work you have to do and then you can sleep. Your brain doesn't
[51:26.700 --> 51:33.260]  bounce around like a baby in a boxcar. So I highly recommend Brain Force. I really like the new
[51:33.260 --> 51:39.980]  liquid formula. I find it superior because the absorption is immediate and it works. It's a
[51:39.980 --> 51:47.180]  subtle lift. In other words, it doesn't, you don't feel jolted but now you felt too tired to write
[51:47.180 --> 51:52.780]  that email or to record that video. Now suddenly you've got not only the creative energy but the
[51:52.780 --> 51:58.540]  physical energy. So I can't say enough about this product. And Alex, I'm not compensated to say any
[51:58.540 --> 52:03.980]  of this. So no, we don't have some secret deal where Stone will plug our products. No, I'm saying
[52:03.980 --> 52:08.700]  this because it's true and for no other reason. And also I got in a rub, you'll have plenty of time
[52:08.700 --> 52:14.380]  next hour, but it's funny you raised this. Last time you just brought up off air, how much you liked
[52:14.380 --> 52:19.820]  one of the products and the iodine. And then I said, well, you ought to say that on air. So we
[52:19.820 --> 52:25.900]  came back, you said it. They made a huge, like it was a scandal that you promoted the iodine product
[52:25.900 --> 52:31.340]  and it was so evil. Here's a new one. Media Matters tattled and said, Alex Jones show is streaming
[52:31.340 --> 52:36.220]  on Spotify. We weren't doing it. Somebody else was doing it. But it said, oh, following publication
[52:36.220 --> 52:41.900]  report, Spotify appears to have removed the Alex Jones show from the platform. So literal
[52:41.900 --> 52:49.020]  tattletale hall monitors that try to control things. Oh, Roger Stone likes iodine. Don't get it.
[52:49.020 --> 52:54.380]  Oh, oh, Alex Jones is on Spotify. Get him off again. I mean, these people have no shame, Roger.
[52:54.380 --> 53:02.300]  Talk about un-American garbage. They tried to say that I'm somehow selling quackery. Iodine is
[53:02.300 --> 53:08.220]  indisputably extremely value in terms of boosting natural immunity. There's no dispute about that.
[53:08.220 --> 53:14.380]  All I was pointing out was that the iodine product sold at InfoWars is of the highest quality.
[53:14.380 --> 53:21.100]  I mean, I bought iodine down at the vitamin shop and I've ordered it on Amazon as much as I hate
[53:21.100 --> 53:27.660]  giving Jeff Bezos a penny. But it's not of the quality that you can get at InfoWars. That's
[53:27.660 --> 53:33.260]  all I was saying. They make it sound like this is some kind of huxterism or that I'm somehow
[53:33.260 --> 53:38.540]  compensated to push these products. No, I said it because I'd just gotten over the Chinese virus
[53:38.540 --> 53:44.620]  and I was at the point where all I had left was this nagging cough thanks to ivermectin
[53:44.620 --> 53:49.660]  and hydroxychloroquine. I had a quick recovery. That'll ensure that we're banned everywhere,
[53:49.660 --> 53:55.900]  just that I mentioned those. And I talked about the quality of the product. It's a joke. Let's
[53:55.900 --> 53:59.420]  move to the question. No, I'm not totally going to come back and do a few segments next hour to
[53:59.420 --> 54:05.100]  get into the other issues. But, yeah, Russia, where is this going? Look, I think we're headed
[54:05.100 --> 54:10.460]  to potentially a world war. First of all, there will be no military response from Joe Biden.
[54:11.260 --> 54:16.060]  That's my prediction. You're going to see sanctions that Putin will laugh at.
[54:16.060 --> 54:20.220]  Meanwhile, Biden will be calling on the other line, seeing if he can order more oil,
[54:20.860 --> 54:27.180]  because Donald Trump had this nation to oil independence, to energy independence. We didn't
[54:27.180 --> 54:32.300]  have to rely on OPIC. We didn't have to rely on the Saudis or anyone else in the Middle East.
[54:32.300 --> 54:39.420]  We didn't have to rely on Russia. Now, we are propping up their economy with the one hand
[54:39.420 --> 54:45.580]  and trying to shut their economy down with the other hand. It makes no sense whatsoever.
[54:45.580 --> 54:50.220]  And let me throw this at you, Roger. Why did they not ever invade during four years of Trump,
[54:50.220 --> 54:58.700]  but did under Obama, did under now Biden? And that's A and then B. Why would Biden telegraph?
[54:58.700 --> 55:02.700]  Well, we're not going to military respond if they invade. Trump would never say that.
[55:02.700 --> 55:06.060]  Then, of course, Putin could invade. Whether you're for what Putin did or not
[55:06.060 --> 55:11.180]  or neutral, I'm not a military tactician, but you don't tell people we're not going to respond.
[55:11.180 --> 55:18.060]  And that's crazy. This is something Trump talked about previously ever being in politics.
[55:18.060 --> 55:22.540]  Why would you telegraph your punch? Why would you tell your adversaries what you will
[55:22.540 --> 55:27.100]  and will not do? It's kind of like General Milley calling the head of the Chinese military and
[55:27.100 --> 55:30.700]  saying, don't worry, we're never going to launch a strike against you. And if we do,
[55:30.700 --> 55:37.900]  if we anticipate any action against you, I'll call you in advance. That's not stupid, Mr.
[55:37.900 --> 55:43.660]  President. That's called treason. That's treasonous. Should you become president? Again,
[55:43.660 --> 55:49.340]  I don't think there's any statute of limitation on treason, by the way. So it is outrageous.
[55:49.340 --> 55:55.660]  But look, this would never even happened under Trump. Trump utilized the madman theory of Richard
[55:55.660 --> 56:00.940]  Nixon. Henry Kissinger would go to the North Koreans and say, look, Nixon's out of his mind.
[56:00.940 --> 56:05.580]  He might just push the button and blow you all to oblivion. I don't know if I can contain him,
[56:05.580 --> 56:11.020]  but you need to make a peace deal now because he will use American power. They knew Trump was a
[56:11.020 --> 56:15.980]  wild card. First of all, they knew, and I've written this, he was the toughest president we've ever
[56:15.980 --> 56:21.420]  had. In politics, he was the toughest man I ever dealt with. I worked for Bob Dole, who was really
[56:21.420 --> 56:27.260]  a tough guy. I worked for Richard Nixon, who is not exactly a cream puff. Donald Trump has
[56:27.260 --> 56:32.460]  ice water in his veins, particularly when he's negotiating over something that matters,
[56:32.460 --> 56:37.580]  such as the security of the United States. None of these things would have happened under Donald
[56:37.580 --> 56:44.140]  Trump. He's kind of laughing at the Germans now. The Germans are in more trouble than they've ever
[56:44.140 --> 56:50.540]  been. The pipeline that we worked so hard to turn off, to now excuse me, Biden's going to turn it
[56:50.540 --> 56:58.940]  back on, you can't sanction Russia economically at the same time you are propping them up economically
[56:58.940 --> 57:05.820]  through your energy policies, but that's exactly what we're doing. All you can say definitively
[57:05.820 --> 57:11.180]  is that the response of the Biden administration, who's egged on this war, by the way, I don't think
[57:11.180 --> 57:15.260]  the Ukrainians believe this could have been resolved as well. We saw the Ukrainian president
[57:15.260 --> 57:22.060]  essentially call Vice President Harris a liar last weekend. They are pushing war. They are
[57:22.060 --> 57:27.100]  advocating for war. They need it to distract from the fact that the Chinese are taking us to the
[57:27.100 --> 57:33.020]  cleaners. They need it to distract us from Hunter Biden's grifting and the fact that Biden and his
[57:33.020 --> 57:37.100]  entire family have been paid off by the Chinese. That's right. This is get-on analysis. Roger,
[57:37.100 --> 57:43.420]  how do people find your websites and more? They can go to StoneColdTruth.com, StoneColdTruth.com.
[57:43.420 --> 57:47.340]  Stay right there. We're coming right back to you. We're going to get into the election and more.
[57:49.100 --> 57:55.100]  I've been on air more than 25 years, and long before I started selling high-quality vitamin
[57:55.100 --> 58:02.700]  D3 eight years ago, I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential. And
[58:02.700 --> 58:07.100]  if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're black or white or Hispanic, it
[58:07.100 --> 58:12.300]  doesn't matter. Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that are out
[58:12.300 --> 58:17.260]  there. It's just like you need oxygen. You die in four minutes without oxygen. You die in five or
[58:17.260 --> 58:22.780]  six days without water. You die in a month without food. Well, that's because these key minerals and
[58:22.780 --> 58:27.820]  elements and vitamins are in the food that you need. And one of the most important for your immune
[58:27.820 --> 58:33.020]  system and your overall health is vitamin D3. We have the highest quality in winter sun with
[58:33.020 --> 58:41.420]  vitamin K that boosts all your body's offenses available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[58:41.420 --> 58:46.220]  Everybody, old, young, black, white, you need vitamin D3. This is the best quality out there,
[58:46.220 --> 58:50.940]  and it funds the info war 50% off. With the world awakening, I think what's important that we
[58:50.940 --> 58:54.780]  rise to momentum right now, take advantage of this moment. And I've always had an idea that
[58:54.780 --> 58:58.940]  something everybody can do with every listener can do. I think it'd be powerful and effective for
[58:58.940 --> 59:04.540]  us to, you know, hang the banners over highways. Imagine a shot being a piece of a layup. It says
[59:04.540 --> 59:09.500]  Alex Jones is right infowarstore.com. We stand with the truckers or rest out or whatever.
[59:09.500 --> 59:14.620]  Brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this. Yes. Now is the time in your small town or your
[59:14.620 --> 59:20.140]  big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on your car or banner hangs
[59:20.140 --> 59:24.940]  over highways and it will be a chain reaction. What do you recommend people say on these banner
[59:24.940 --> 59:29.980]  hangs? I have a few ideas. First of all, help just before you fall into a farm. Rest out,
[59:29.980 --> 59:33.740]  rest while the vaccine is poisoned. There's tons of things. I said, just keep it short,
[59:33.740 --> 59:39.340]  keep it concise. I agree. Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates, the COVID vaccine, poison. Beautiful.
[59:39.340 --> 59:42.940]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved if we could all be affected though. That's what
[59:42.940 --> 59:47.900]  I'm calling about. God bless you, Chris. In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[59:47.900 --> 59:56.380]  Thank you so much. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:05.500 --> 1:00:07.980]  All right, Roger, you got some big news. We're gonna break some six minutes
[1:00:07.980 --> 1:00:11.820]  and some days to join us. A lot of folks are tuned in now. This little no man's land.
[1:00:13.020 --> 1:00:18.540]  What else is on your scope, on your radar in the world with the Democrats crashing and burning
[1:00:18.540 --> 1:00:22.780]  with 257 days out from the election? What do they do to extricate themselves?
[1:00:24.700 --> 1:00:29.420]  Well, they clearly need this war as a distraction because between energy prices,
[1:00:29.980 --> 1:00:36.380]  the so-called supply chain problem, most grocery stores now in Florida, there are many food
[1:00:36.380 --> 1:00:42.060]  stuffs, things you just, you can't buy, you can't find. I'm sorry, in the richest, most
[1:00:42.060 --> 1:00:46.380]  prosperous country in the world, I refuse to believe that there are a shortage of, say,
[1:00:46.380 --> 1:00:54.620]  chicken wings, not buying it. We are on the verge of a Canadian type situation,
[1:00:54.620 --> 1:01:00.860]  which our Justice Department is out of control, has been unduly politicized. There was a piece
[1:01:00.860 --> 1:01:06.140]  in the Washington Post yesterday trying to debunk the absolute fact that Hillary Clinton got caught
[1:01:06.140 --> 1:01:13.980]  red-handed by John Durham, the special counsel spying on Trump. I love this. Michael Sussman,
[1:01:13.980 --> 1:01:21.500]  who was one of Hillary's henchmen, who was busted in by Durham, complains about the
[1:01:21.500 --> 1:01:30.380]  prejudicial media and the politicized charges filed by Durham. Perhaps he never read the charges
[1:01:30.380 --> 1:01:37.340]  filed against me by Robert Mueller. Let me remind you, I was going to be found guilty of mail fraud,
[1:01:37.340 --> 1:01:42.860]  wire fraud, conspiracy against the United States, money laundering millions of dollars,
[1:01:42.860 --> 1:01:49.660]  unauthorized access to a computer, trafficking in stolen data, misprison of a felony,
[1:01:49.660 --> 1:01:55.660]  accessory to a felony after the fact. Mueller told multiple federal judges he had probable
[1:01:55.660 --> 1:02:01.020]  cause to charge me for all of those crimes. He found no evidence whatsoever of any of those
[1:02:01.020 --> 1:02:08.140]  crimes without unlimited financing and legal authority. They could find no crimes, so they
[1:02:08.140 --> 1:02:13.820]  fashioned the crime of lying about Russian collusion. Now let's be logical. You cannot lie
[1:02:13.820 --> 1:02:19.180]  about something that did not happen. The judge says specifically I lied to cover up for Donald
[1:02:19.180 --> 1:02:26.140]  Trump's involvement in Russian collusion, and that never happened. My charges in the two-year
[1:02:26.140 --> 1:02:34.940]  hell that I went through, which I was vilified, smeared, threatened, obviously bankrupted, gagged,
[1:02:34.940 --> 1:02:41.740]  lynched, and then subjected to a Soviet-style show trial, the Democrats are now squealing
[1:02:41.740 --> 1:02:49.020]  that Hillary and her cohorts are being subjected to prejudicial media and presidential charges
[1:02:49.020 --> 1:02:54.780]  from Durham. But let me come to the bottom line, and it's a sad one, Alex. Durham has purposely
[1:02:54.780 --> 1:03:00.940]  run out the clock. Hillary Clinton is not going to be prosecuted. He's going to conclude that she
[1:03:00.940 --> 1:03:07.580]  and her retinue-convicted were guilty of multiple crimes. He's also going to say that he is time
[1:03:07.580 --> 1:03:14.780]  barred by the statute of limitations from prosecuting her. That's why I'm seriously thinking about a
[1:03:14.780 --> 1:03:19.980]  class action suit to sue Hillary. I'd probably try to get General Flynn, Maverick, Paul Manafort,
[1:03:19.980 --> 1:03:25.580]  and others to join me. And Roger, that's the big news. I want all the 300 plus radio stations.
[1:03:25.580 --> 1:03:28.380]  We probably have a hundred right now that carry this no man's land because some don't want to
[1:03:28.380 --> 1:03:32.780]  carry news. So they asked us like 15 years ago, hey, just do that first five minutes, we do.
[1:03:32.780 --> 1:03:36.780]  But I want to join the other probably 200 stations aren't carrying us. That is a big
[1:03:36.780 --> 1:03:40.140]  announcement. So save that for a minute. What else do you want to cover when we come back?
[1:03:40.140 --> 1:03:49.020]  Lawsuit today against Adam Schiff in the January 6th committee. They are on the basis of no evidence
[1:03:49.020 --> 1:03:54.860]  whatsoever. They are seeking all of my cell phone records. I'm going to federal court to block that.
[1:03:54.860 --> 1:03:59.180]  It's a fishing expedition. There's no probable cause. Believe me, they're doing it to me. They're
[1:03:59.180 --> 1:04:04.140]  doing it to our whole crew. The listeners have no idea how much this costs. The costs are
[1:04:04.140 --> 1:04:08.940]  astronomical. So I want to talk about that lawsuit and I want to talk about holding them
[1:04:08.940 --> 1:04:14.620]  accountable. It's time for us to sue them. It's time for us to see all of John Podesta's emails,
[1:04:14.620 --> 1:04:18.940]  at least the ones we didn't see that were dumped by WikiLeaks, which we had nothing to do with,
[1:04:18.940 --> 1:04:22.860]  which were absolutely accurate and very embarrassing. I totally agree. I don't say this very slowly to
[1:04:22.860 --> 1:04:26.940]  listen. I know they're smart, but I want to sink in with all this other news. They're building the
[1:04:26.940 --> 1:04:33.100]  whole basis of their globalist world government takeover on that we're all terrorized to January
[1:04:33.100 --> 1:04:38.620]  6th and this harassment. So once they're done beta testing and on Roger and I and Joe Biggs
[1:04:38.620 --> 1:04:43.980]  and Stuart Rhodes, once they're done doing that, it's going to be everybody. And you can see that
[1:04:43.980 --> 1:04:49.900]  now. They admit that this is their attempted Soviet takeover of America. So this is a big issue
[1:04:50.540 --> 1:04:53.900]  that people aren't focused on. But we're going to talk about it in 60 seconds with the one,
[1:04:53.900 --> 1:05:04.460]  the only Roger Stone. I've been on air more than 25 years. And long before I started selling
[1:05:04.460 --> 1:05:11.420]  high quality vitamin D three eight years ago, I've been promoting people taking vitamin D three,
[1:05:11.420 --> 1:05:16.940]  because it is essential. And if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're black
[1:05:16.940 --> 1:05:22.300]  or white or Hispanic, it doesn't matter. Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many
[1:05:22.300 --> 1:05:26.140]  of the threats that are out there. It's just like you need oxygen. You died four minutes without
[1:05:26.140 --> 1:05:31.340]  oxygen. You die in five or six days without water. You died a month without food. Well,
[1:05:31.340 --> 1:05:36.860]  that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that you need.
[1:05:36.860 --> 1:05:40.860]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D
[1:05:40.860 --> 1:05:46.300]  three. We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boost all your body's
[1:05:46.300 --> 1:05:54.460]  offenses available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com. Everybody old, young, black, white,
[1:05:54.460 --> 1:06:10.380]  you need vitamin D three. This is the best quality out there. And it funds the info or 50% off.
[1:06:24.780 --> 1:06:41.260]  We are no longer on the eve of war. We are in a global conflict.
[1:06:42.620 --> 1:06:45.260]  So amazing footage coming in of shot down Russian helicopters.
[1:06:46.460 --> 1:06:53.260]  Full scale invasion. One thing Biden said was true. I guess clocks, even when they're broken are
[1:06:53.260 --> 1:06:58.620]  right twice a day. This is history. But we'll get to that next segment. Open the phones up.
[1:06:58.620 --> 1:07:04.060]  Take your calls for several hours. Got so much big breaking news that Roger Stone is here with
[1:07:04.060 --> 1:07:11.260]  massive January 6 Intel and information and why this is so important, how they're planning
[1:07:11.260 --> 1:07:16.380]  a civil emergency like Trudeau has done here in America and how we need to get on the offense
[1:07:16.380 --> 1:07:21.660]  peacefully, legally, lawfully against this. Roger Stone, you've got some big news for all the
[1:07:21.660 --> 1:07:28.300]  stations that just joined us. So let's be very clear. Our goal when we went to Washington on
[1:07:28.300 --> 1:07:36.300]  January 5 and 6 was to win a 10 day delay delay in the certification of the election of Joe Biden
[1:07:36.300 --> 1:07:41.900]  to leave time for closer examination and investigation of extensive irregularities
[1:07:41.900 --> 1:07:48.540]  in the voting in Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada and elsewhere. That is
[1:07:48.540 --> 1:07:54.860]  not seditious. It is not illegal. It is not treasonous. It's exactly what Hillary did in 2016.
[1:07:54.860 --> 1:07:59.100]  You may not remember this, Alex, but Hillary demanded and John Podesta demanded that they
[1:07:59.100 --> 1:08:03.900]  make a special presentation to the electoral college to try to stave off the certification
[1:08:03.900 --> 1:08:09.100]  of Donald Trump's election. Nobody jumped up and down and screamed treason or sedition there.
[1:08:09.100 --> 1:08:15.340]  So the people who broke into the Capitol, that action was counterproductive to what we were
[1:08:15.340 --> 1:08:20.700]  trying to achieve. We were trying to achieve something perfectly legal under our system.
[1:08:20.700 --> 1:08:27.020]  Beyond that, however, just questioning the election results in a speech, in a podcast,
[1:08:27.020 --> 1:08:31.260]  on a show like Info Wars, whether you're the president of the United States or whether you're
[1:08:31.260 --> 1:08:35.820]  Alex Jones or whether you're Roger Stone or whether you're Joe Smith, it's perfectly legal.
[1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:42.700]  It's constitutionally protected speech. Jerry Nadler questioned the elections on Trump in 2016.
[1:08:42.700 --> 1:08:47.020]  Now, we thought he was a jackass, but we never called him a traitor when he did that.
[1:08:47.020 --> 1:08:53.420]  So we have two different sets of a standard here. The most important thing to announce today is
[1:08:53.980 --> 1:09:00.380]  that I received a subpoena for all of my cell phone records in November, January and December,
[1:09:00.380 --> 1:09:08.380]  this past three months. I filed a lawsuit only hours ago against Adam Schiff
[1:09:08.380 --> 1:09:15.020]  and the House Intelligence, over the House January 6th committee. This is a fishing expedition.
[1:09:15.020 --> 1:09:21.020]  This is yet another witch hunt. One of the lawsuits, one in which I'm actually not a plaintiff,
[1:09:21.020 --> 1:09:27.500]  was upheld last week because the judge ruled that because I had spoken to Donald Trump post
[1:09:27.500 --> 1:09:33.820]  election and because I had come in contact with members of the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys,
[1:09:33.820 --> 1:09:39.420]  that it was reasonable to assume that additional discovery would turn up other evidence of wrong
[1:09:39.420 --> 1:09:47.980]  doing. With all due respect, judge, it will turn over nothing whatsoever, nothing, zero. There is no
[1:09:47.980 --> 1:09:54.780]  there, there. I went to Washington as you did, Alex, and I exercised my First Amendment rights.
[1:09:54.780 --> 1:10:03.420]  I never advocated violence or insurrection or unlawfulness. In fact, doing so would have been
[1:10:03.420 --> 1:10:09.100]  completely counterproductive to what I went there for, which is to win a 10-day delay.
[1:10:09.980 --> 1:10:16.300]  So I have not only taken this action, but now in all honesty, with the Durham Report out
[1:10:16.860 --> 1:10:21.020]  and the clowns at the Washington Post trying desperately to spin it as if it didn't happen,
[1:10:21.580 --> 1:10:28.940]  I'm contemplating a massive class action lawsuit, suing Hillary, Podesta and all of them. You see,
[1:10:28.940 --> 1:10:34.140]  you can't sue the government. I can't sue Mueller or the corrupt prosecutors no matter how corrupt
[1:10:34.140 --> 1:10:40.540]  their actions. You can't sue the FBI. They're immune from prosecution, but I can sue her
[1:10:40.540 --> 1:10:45.900]  and her retinue, and I'm seriously considering it, but I have to be honest with you. I can't even
[1:10:45.900 --> 1:10:51.100]  afford the lawsuit I filed this morning. I had to promise the lawyers who filed it that I would go
[1:10:51.100 --> 1:10:57.420]  out and raise the money to pay them because the till at the Stone Defense Fund is empty. It's empty
[1:10:57.420 --> 1:11:02.860]  because it's been eaten up with the six other harassment lawsuits I have to defend about,
[1:11:02.860 --> 1:11:07.340]  and the fact that, frankly, in terms of my own ability to make money, I've been paying for my
[1:11:07.340 --> 1:11:12.140]  wife's alternative cancer care, which is effective, but not inexpensive. So...
[1:11:12.140 --> 1:11:15.980]  And, Roger, let me expand on this. We're running out of money. You're running out of money, and this
[1:11:15.980 --> 1:11:21.100]  is the critical time in the battle. The whole group coming after us, the Democratic Party,
[1:11:21.100 --> 1:11:26.780]  is now trying to... They have sued years ago the radio network I'm on that was not super
[1:11:26.780 --> 1:11:31.820]  profitable and has over 700 affiliates for their shows, but Ted was actually looking to offload
[1:11:31.820 --> 1:11:35.980]  it or just get out of it because he's not making any money. They just said, hey, just give us your
[1:11:35.980 --> 1:11:42.060]  network and we won't sue you. We want Alex Jones off the air. Next level stuff. And then I've got
[1:11:42.060 --> 1:11:47.180]  this. Look at this. They're running this ad every break, megaphone for conspiracy, the Alex Jones
[1:11:47.180 --> 1:11:54.780]  story, and they sent me the questions, Roger, and like literally most of the questions are 100%
[1:11:54.780 --> 1:12:02.540]  made up. 100% made up stuff that there's no truth to it. Just like it's so fantastical,
[1:12:03.260 --> 1:12:07.100]  and I guess CNN has no audience, but why do you think they're doing this?
[1:12:07.820 --> 1:12:11.260]  Well, first of all, I want to point out they sent you the questions after their documentary was
[1:12:11.260 --> 1:12:16.220]  already made. So your questions, your answers are irrelevant. But Alex, please remember,
[1:12:16.220 --> 1:12:21.340]  Stone's greatest role. The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.
[1:12:21.340 --> 1:12:24.620]  No, no, I totally agree with you, but here's another example. Sandy Hook families are
[1:12:24.620 --> 1:12:29.020]  requesting records of conversations between Alex Jones and Joe Rogan. Now they're harassing Joe
[1:12:29.020 --> 1:12:33.740]  Rogan like every American can be subpoenaed and have their data taken as Alex Jones question
[1:12:33.740 --> 1:12:40.380]  to shooting. It's just like January 6. It's a giant witch hunt. There's no question about it.
[1:12:40.380 --> 1:12:46.700]  But Alex, we have no choice but to fight and we can't fight if we are unarmed financially.
[1:12:46.700 --> 1:12:52.460]  So people need to go to stonedefensefund.com. Help me not only sue Adam Schiff in the January
[1:12:52.460 --> 1:12:58.060]  6 committee, but help me sue Hillary Clinton and her retinue. I'm going to try to get Alex Jones
[1:12:58.060 --> 1:13:01.660]  and General Flynn and maybe Paul Manafort to join me in that class.
[1:13:01.660 --> 1:13:06.460]  Oh, I'm on board. I mean, I have to fight back. I don't even we have to do it. StoneDefenseFund.com.
[1:13:06.460 --> 1:13:11.420]  People can find books, films, t-shirts and more on your other site and find your podcasts and
[1:13:11.420 --> 1:13:16.620]  shows. Where do we find everything? Roger Stone. You can go to stonecoldtruth.com and go to the
[1:13:16.620 --> 1:13:21.980]  shop. You can get your iconic Roger Stone did nothing wrong t-shirt. That's the t-shirt I was
[1:13:21.980 --> 1:13:30.700]  arrested in by 29 heavily armed FBI agents. There may be some who argue, Alex, that we don't have
[1:13:30.700 --> 1:13:36.620]  ongoing damages. Actually, the censorship of me on social media platforms because I'm alleged
[1:13:36.620 --> 1:13:42.860]  to be a Russian intelligence asset, that's an ongoing damage to me. The personal threats,
[1:13:42.860 --> 1:13:49.500]  the death threats, this is ongoing. So I'm happy to have filed this lawsuit today.
[1:13:49.500 --> 1:13:54.380]  I can't wait to have Adam Schiff, you know, on the stand and under deposition. I'm sure he's
[1:13:54.380 --> 1:13:57.340]  going to seek to hide behind his conversion. Senator Clark, that's breaking. You have,
[1:13:57.340 --> 1:14:00.940]  because we talked out in the weekend you were in a couple or a few days ago, you have sued Schiff
[1:14:00.940 --> 1:14:07.260]  today. We filed the lawsuit against Schiff and the members of the January 6th committee this morning
[1:14:07.260 --> 1:14:15.100]  to halt their attempts to achieve, to get my my cell phone records for this past November,
[1:14:15.100 --> 1:14:21.260]  January, December and January. Because there's no probable cause. There's nothing there to find.
[1:14:21.260 --> 1:14:25.340]  By the way, I have nothing to hide. If they do win them, they're going to learn nothing other than
[1:14:25.340 --> 1:14:31.500]  that I talk occasionally to Alex Jones and that, you know, and that we're good friends. That proves
[1:14:31.500 --> 1:14:36.140]  precisely nothing. Unbelievable. Roger, thank you so much and God bless you. We'll talk to you soon.
[1:14:37.020 --> 1:14:42.380]  Great to be with you, Alex. And folks, please go on in force now, buy the products, go to Stone
[1:14:42.380 --> 1:14:48.460]  Defense Fund, get a product. This is the tip of the spear. They want to close info wars down,
[1:14:48.460 --> 1:14:52.700]  so Rogers don't can't appear anyplace. Don't let them do it. That's right. God bless you,
[1:14:52.700 --> 1:14:55.500]  Roger. We're going to come back at the number out and then take the calls and cover all the
[1:14:55.500 --> 1:15:00.620]  breaking news right now with this potential for worldwide war to break out. But you want people
[1:15:00.620 --> 1:15:05.660]  in the arena, folks, you want people to fight. You want people to tell the truth. Well, we can't
[1:15:05.660 --> 1:15:09.820]  do it without sponsors. We're not funded by George Soros. And that's why if I got all the money I
[1:15:09.820 --> 1:15:13.660]  needed and one plug a day, we do it. But I'm like a baby bird, beggin to be fed or I'm going to die.
[1:15:13.660 --> 1:15:18.300]  It's like and I get Roger on because he's under the same attack and you want to stay in the game.
[1:15:18.300 --> 1:15:22.300]  You want us to stay in the fight. You want him to stay on Trump's ear and influence Trump to
[1:15:22.300 --> 1:15:27.500]  really fight tyranny. You got to keep us on air, folks. Our influence is just my influence,
[1:15:27.500 --> 1:15:32.540]  the show's influence, our guest influence is just exploding. And that makes the globalists and left
[1:15:32.540 --> 1:15:36.780]  can even matter and matter and matter because they haven't shut us down yet. But you're like
[1:15:36.780 --> 1:15:42.860]  gravity keeping us in the sky. You hold us in place. You renew us second to second info war

[1:17:43.420 --> 1:17:50.380]  can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit. That's why truth comes
[1:17:50.380 --> 1:17:54.780]  with hard work and with research and diligence. And that's why it's hard to share in full wars

[1:20:14.460 --> 1:20:18.300]  Leaving start in the broadcast the last few years of air raid sirens many days.
[1:20:18.300 --> 1:20:26.300]  I've warned you real air raid sirens are coming. Now those are the real air raid sirens.
[1:20:33.180 --> 1:20:39.420]  There's no doubt Russia is completely invading Ukraine. So Biden actually told the truth for once.
[1:20:41.500 --> 1:20:47.420]  I had said back in October and I've said back in November and December,
[1:20:47.420 --> 1:20:55.340]  we'll play those clips here in a minute, that my sources said by late February at the latest,
[1:20:55.340 --> 1:21:02.060]  that's word for word, that you would see Russia and China move in. And you know,
[1:21:02.780 --> 1:21:06.060]  I love the Twitter comments. Most of them are positive, but some are negative. They're like,
[1:21:06.060 --> 1:21:14.460]  he's definitely an insider. He's definitely a fed. He's definitely Illuminati. How's he know this?
[1:21:14.460 --> 1:21:22.940]  Well, if you spent your time for 28 years being on air reading books and documents and
[1:21:22.940 --> 1:21:30.140]  recovering real issues, then you get successful and you meet all the thinkers and then they call you
[1:21:30.140 --> 1:21:38.060]  and tell you stuff. I told people that one of the richest people out there told me this and
[1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:45.180]  that military sources confirmed it. Elon Musk came out separately and said, look for the stock
[1:21:45.180 --> 1:21:49.740]  market to crash in February. He said that about a month after I first started talking about it.
[1:21:51.420 --> 1:21:54.220]  I mean, Elon was right here in Austin. Did you think it was Elon I was talking to?
[1:21:55.340 --> 1:22:02.380]  No, it wasn't him. Listen, the point is, is that it's not about Hollywood where I sit here and
[1:22:02.380 --> 1:22:07.820]  I name drop and it's, oh, I'm in with the cool group. I mean, I was freaked out when I told you
[1:22:07.820 --> 1:22:13.340]  in October that I was out to dinner with some folks, very famous. They said, we heard this. What
[1:22:13.340 --> 1:22:16.700]  do you think? And I said, let me make some calls. I made some calls, very smart people. They said,
[1:22:16.700 --> 1:22:22.460]  yeah, that's what we're here as well. How do you know that? Not many people know that. Well,
[1:22:22.460 --> 1:22:27.740]  when you're at this level, you get to know all that. And so the issue isn't about, oh, look,
[1:22:27.740 --> 1:22:33.740]  I was right. Alan Jones is not for Thomas. Most of the stuff we already know because the globalist
[1:22:33.740 --> 1:22:38.540]  brag about it. And I'm telling you how to learn this stuff on your own. And it's beautiful.
[1:22:39.740 --> 1:22:43.740]  I got a big example of this right here. I don't give the number to us. We start taking your calls
[1:22:43.740 --> 1:22:56.940]  here. The toll free number to join us is 8777892539877789 Alex 877789 Alex. But I want to give people
[1:22:56.940 --> 1:23:03.900]  that are in Europe, in Ukraine, in Poland, in Russia, in Belarus, anywhere in that area of Europe.
[1:23:03.900 --> 1:23:07.660]  I want to ask the listeners to be polite in the first round. We'll see if we get some calls. We
[1:23:07.660 --> 1:23:14.700]  probably will from Ukraine, from Belarus, from Poland, from those other areas. I'd like to hear
[1:23:14.700 --> 1:23:21.820]  from you. I'd like to know what you think about the situation. The country code to call if your
[1:23:21.820 --> 1:23:37.900]  1-800 number won't work where you're at is 015126461776. That's 015126461776 or 8777892539.
[1:23:37.900 --> 1:23:41.500]  But let me show you this, and then we'll go to break in six, seven minutes, come back and take
[1:23:41.500 --> 1:23:47.820]  your calls. This is what folks are putting out on Twitter and Instagram and everywhere, and it's
[1:23:47.820 --> 1:23:52.540]  going viral. You can look it up. It's true. I don't just believe what people put out.
[1:23:52.540 --> 1:23:58.460]  The World Economic Forum. Countries where the prime minister is a member of the World Economic
[1:23:58.460 --> 1:24:04.380]  Forum, and it's basically every country in Western Europe, except for Spain and Portugal.
[1:24:05.980 --> 1:24:11.340]  That's a real cult. That's what we're up against. Here's an example in Canada. How many people,
[1:24:11.340 --> 1:24:21.420]  get the premieres of all these different areas, members of parliament, conservative party,
[1:24:21.420 --> 1:24:26.300]  liberal parties. You've got the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, and a bunch of the
[1:24:26.300 --> 1:24:35.340]  cabinet. It's all them, and they brag. It's them. So see, oh, oh, how did, how did Theo
[1:24:35.340 --> 1:24:41.340]  foolery? I don't know who this is. How did Theo foolery know this? He must be an insider. The
[1:24:41.340 --> 1:24:49.580]  CIA must have come in. No, he went and looked it up, and he went and made a graphic, and you can
[1:24:49.580 --> 1:24:55.420]  go look it up. It's true. See, you can do it yourself. You could go get a piece of property and grow
[1:24:55.420 --> 1:25:01.100]  corn on it. You could have an oil painting. You could go pick up a nice girl, take her out,
[1:25:01.100 --> 1:25:07.340]  have fun with her, get married to her, and have kids. You could do something. But oh, Alex Jones
[1:25:07.340 --> 1:25:13.020]  has got magic help from the magic elves of the, what? No, no, I'm self-made working with other
[1:25:13.020 --> 1:25:17.820]  great people that are self-made that want to fight tearing. So I attacked the fact that I've
[1:25:17.820 --> 1:25:22.300]  been proven right about a lot of stuff because I'm magically given something. Dude, we ain't
[1:25:22.300 --> 1:25:27.580]  operating on welfare around here. We're not operating on people giving us a step up. We picked
[1:25:27.580 --> 1:25:32.460]  ourselves up and I've raised that not to talk about me and who I am and how great I am, but the
[1:25:32.460 --> 1:25:38.060]  people out there on the internet that don't get, they could go know all this too. And as soon as
[1:25:38.060 --> 1:25:45.500]  people figure out how valuable it is, just from a business point of view, like I don't own any stock
[1:25:45.500 --> 1:25:48.940]  because I'm not going to get some insider trade deal. But I knew Joe Rogan was going to spot a
[1:25:48.940 --> 1:25:53.820]  five, six months before he did. Didn't tell anybody. Didn't buy any stock. Didn't do it. Went up 50%
[1:25:53.820 --> 1:25:59.340]  or whatever one day. And I told you, there's going to be a war in February for my sources.
[1:25:59.340 --> 1:26:03.420]  And I said, you should get positioned. I don't own stock, but you should. I did that because I
[1:26:03.420 --> 1:26:09.100]  wanted to show you how the real world works. So you would get into this and stop letting other
[1:26:09.100 --> 1:26:13.740]  people monopolize understanding about the world works. The way we beat the bad guys
[1:26:13.740 --> 1:26:17.580]  is going to the good people to wake up and figure out how the world really works. And that's
[1:26:17.580 --> 1:26:21.740]  what info wars is, is not being the little kids table at Thanksgiving or Christmas,
[1:26:21.740 --> 1:26:28.220]  but the adult table. This is the adult table. Let's play a couple of these clips
[1:26:29.740 --> 1:26:33.980]  where we predict all this in October, November, and December of last year. Here it is.
[1:26:35.420 --> 1:26:40.140]  We are not just here talking about what they've already done to us. We must ask ourselves,
[1:26:40.140 --> 1:26:44.380]  how would they carry out such a mass extermination operation that's already killed millions
[1:26:44.380 --> 1:26:48.620]  worldwide with these deadly shots that are soft killed binary weapons?
[1:26:48.620 --> 1:27:00.780]  How would they get away with this? And the answer is a massive financial collapse,
[1:27:00.780 --> 1:27:07.180]  a war. And so you've got the IMF saying imminent global financial collapse. They've never talked
[1:27:07.180 --> 1:27:12.220]  like that. That means they're obviously trying to trigger that. And, oh, imminent cyber attack.
[1:27:12.220 --> 1:27:19.740]  Oh, an imminent war with Russia. So I guess China can then swoop into Taiwan, Hong Kong.
[1:27:20.540 --> 1:27:26.060]  They already got Hong Kong, the South China Sea. They're saying they own part of Vietnam now.
[1:27:26.060 --> 1:27:32.940]  And I don't want a war. But we're looking at a giant war in February right now. Currently,
[1:27:32.940 --> 1:27:38.380]  that's the projections with the top people on the earth who claim they're not with the new
[1:27:38.380 --> 1:27:46.940]  old order combine is war in February. And this is the type of time like right before World War
[1:27:46.940 --> 1:27:52.540]  One, right before World War Two, when everything kicks off. And I hope that doesn't happen.
[1:27:53.740 --> 1:28:01.820]  But currently, that is the trajectory we're on. And there is a consensus on that.
[1:28:01.820 --> 1:28:11.500]  So there you go, folks. And why was Alex Jones right? Because Alex Jones, it is homework.
[1:28:12.380 --> 1:28:18.620]  Not because it was work. I mean, you start reading all the history stuff that's out there,
[1:28:18.620 --> 1:28:23.420]  it's fascinating. So while full grown men are watching Marvel comics and imaginary battles
[1:28:23.420 --> 1:28:27.100]  and all this crap, I'm actually learning how the world really works and saying, wow,
[1:28:27.100 --> 1:28:33.020]  there's this evil group that's betting everything on us not knowing their plans. The damn plans
[1:28:33.020 --> 1:28:37.500]  are right there. Oh, no, he's got a secret contact. He he's got a blah, blah, blah.
[1:28:38.780 --> 1:28:42.220]  Well, that wasn't true when I first researched their own stuff. It was books they wrote. But
[1:28:42.220 --> 1:28:46.620]  now I'm at the level where I do get all those contacts. And then I tell you, because I believe
[1:28:46.620 --> 1:28:51.180]  in you. So take the info instead of saying he's a fan. He's evil. Why do you give it to us?
[1:28:51.180 --> 1:28:56.060]  Maybe because you don't want to have to take action. Do you want to be a jellyfish?
[1:28:58.780 --> 1:29:04.780]  I've been on air more than 25 years. And long before I started selling high quality vitamin
[1:29:04.780 --> 1:29:11.500]  D three eight years ago, I've been promoting people taking vitamin D three, because it is

[1:29:30.220 --> 1:29:35.740]  that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that you need.

[1:31:10.460 --> 1:31:16.380]  that contains both. This info wars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your
[1:31:16.380 --> 1:31:21.420]  next purchase from the info wars store. The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose
[1:31:21.420 --> 1:31:28.060]  flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds. Natural chemicals found in the hips
[1:31:28.060 --> 1:31:33.260]  may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis
[1:31:33.260 --> 1:31:38.620]  and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown as for vitamin C and zinc themselves,
[1:31:38.620 --> 1:31:43.340]  you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense,
[1:31:43.340 --> 1:31:48.220]  and the maintenance of your everyday health. It has been reported that intake of both is often
[1:31:48.220 --> 1:31:53.660]  inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America. So next time you visit, be sure to

[1:32:00.060 --> 1:32:05.580]  taking survival skill, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't
[1:32:05.580 --> 1:32:10.540]  believe, I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[1:32:10.540 --> 1:32:15.180]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1 and it worked pretty good. And
[1:32:15.180 --> 1:32:19.260]  then shortly thereafter you came out with F2, you know, with a deep burn source, you know,
[1:32:19.260 --> 1:32:24.300]  and I got really excited about that. So I took it and man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[1:32:24.300 --> 1:32:29.980]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again, I could connect with
[1:32:29.980 --> 1:32:34.780]  people again. And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I
[1:32:34.780 --> 1:32:39.500]  religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The
[1:32:39.500 --> 1:32:44.300]  one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing,
[1:32:44.300 --> 1:32:49.020]  it works. But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. That's a break free of the
[1:32:49.020 --> 1:32:53.580]  globalist system. And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand.
[1:32:53.580 --> 1:32:56.860]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[1:32:56.860 --> 1:33:06.620]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:06.620 --> 1:33:20.540]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:29.420 --> 1:33:34.220]  We've gotten some calls from Canada and Australia, but no calls from Ukraine,
[1:33:34.220 --> 1:33:39.580]  no calls from Germany, Poland, Russia. So we're going to open the phones up for everybody right
[1:33:39.580 --> 1:33:44.220]  now. We've got to Clayton and Grant and Daniel that are not in the US. The toll free number is
[1:33:44.220 --> 1:33:53.980]  877-789-2539-877-789 Alex. But let's talk about brass tax here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:33:57.900 --> 1:34:01.180]  Do I like watching wars? Do I like watching invasions? Absolutely not.
[1:34:01.180 --> 1:34:07.900]  Did NATO ship weapons into Ukraine and have a proxy war for the last eight years with Russia?
[1:34:07.900 --> 1:34:17.100]  Yes. Did Putin say, say you will not recognize Ukraine into NATO, which he hadn't
[1:34:17.100 --> 1:34:21.820]  told they were about to do, or I'm going to invade and they wouldn't do it. So he invaded
[1:34:21.820 --> 1:34:31.420]  and he has done it. And I'll give credit where it's due. Blinken and Biden and all his controllers did
[1:34:31.420 --> 1:34:35.900]  not lie about this. People lie to you constantly and it's almost always a lie. You tend to not
[1:34:35.900 --> 1:34:42.700]  listen to anything they say. But I said back in October, I said Russia's probably going to invade
[1:34:42.700 --> 1:34:49.820]  Ukraine. But when Blinken and them are like, it's guaranteed, I'm like, these are such damn liars.
[1:34:49.820 --> 1:34:55.900]  Can Satan tell the truth? Maybe the Bible says he can quote scripture and masquerade as an angel
[1:34:55.900 --> 1:35:06.300]  of light. So here we are. But I know this. We've had over a million people the last couple of years
[1:35:06.300 --> 1:35:10.300]  died of fentanyl and that's just the ones that get listed as that. I know our southern borders
[1:35:10.300 --> 1:35:17.020]  are completely wide open. I know the Mexican border has been smashed open and millions of people
[1:35:17.020 --> 1:35:24.540]  from all over the world by boat and by plane and by you name it go to Guatemala and other areas.
[1:35:24.540 --> 1:35:28.540]  We'll show you some of the b-roll of that. Everybody knows about the border. They know about
[1:35:28.540 --> 1:35:36.940]  everything that happened. And, you know, Owen Schreuer and San Antonio showing the big masses
[1:35:36.940 --> 1:35:51.740]  of the illegals coming in and people down the border as well. And so we're here watching all
[1:35:51.740 --> 1:35:59.260]  this unfold. We're here watching this as it takes place. And then we're told that the borders of
[1:35:59.260 --> 1:36:06.540]  Ukraine are the most holy thing in the world and that the Russians shouldn't be there when
[1:36:06.540 --> 1:36:18.700]  the people controlling and running our country. When the very sovereignty of our nation
[1:36:20.140 --> 1:36:26.460]  is being erased in front of the planet. And here's the bottom line. It isn't just that they don't
[1:36:26.460 --> 1:36:31.900]  care and broke the border. It's that the globalists of the UN have told the third world to come here.
[1:36:31.900 --> 1:36:37.500]  They have shut down the third world. They've been in years of lockdowns to then flush them up here
[1:36:37.500 --> 1:36:43.340]  to be now political pawns and a new permanent underclass of the globalist making us the third
[1:36:43.340 --> 1:36:49.500]  world. Not to empower the third world, but to permanently use these masses of people they've
[1:36:49.500 --> 1:36:58.700]  been exploiting as an invasion force they control. And so the invasion of the Russians to secure their
[1:36:58.700 --> 1:37:04.220]  interest and destroy military hardware that the West gave some of the Ukrainians to attack Russia.
[1:37:04.220 --> 1:37:06.700]  I understand why Russia did that. Doesn't mean I agree with it.
[1:37:08.940 --> 1:37:13.260]  But you don't have military hardware streaming across the border of the U.S.
[1:37:13.260 --> 1:37:21.660]  to secure U.S. infrastructure. No, from NATO. We have the globalists bringing people in that are
[1:37:21.660 --> 1:37:27.180]  dependent to use our social safety network to steal a bunch of money into the leftist movements and
[1:37:27.180 --> 1:37:38.060]  then implode the country itself. So they're running up Russian flags on top government
[1:37:38.060 --> 1:37:41.820]  buildings in Ukraine and it looks like Putin is taking the whole country.
[1:37:44.140 --> 1:37:50.460]  And boy, all the threats of NATO, all the threats of Biden, all the big talk, all of it doesn't
[1:37:50.460 --> 1:37:59.180]  matter anymore, does it? So I ask you, is Putin invading America? Is Putin devaluing the dollar?
[1:37:59.180 --> 1:38:04.540]  You know, they're saying on the news inflation is all because the years of inflation, the trillions
[1:38:04.540 --> 1:38:09.500]  that have been printed up, all of that now suddenly overnight two days ago is the Russians.
[1:38:10.140 --> 1:38:16.140]  And make no mistake, cutting off Russian oil and gas to the world is going to increase prices
[1:38:16.140 --> 1:38:20.460]  and the Russians cutting their fertilizer off, that is going to cause more inflation.
[1:38:22.780 --> 1:38:28.540]  But that's like adding fuel onto a fire that's already going. The fire was started by the
[1:38:28.540 --> 1:38:34.380]  globalists and there's a lot of articles that get this and there's a good article by Brandon
[1:38:34.380 --> 1:38:41.500]  Smith of Alt Market. It's on infowars.com ordered out of chaos how the Ukraine conflict is designed
[1:38:41.500 --> 1:38:47.580]  to benefit the globalists. It's a very good article and that's why an angrier world, a collapsing
[1:38:47.580 --> 1:38:53.660]  world, a two-year lockdown doubled the profits of the average billionaire, doubled their net
[1:38:53.660 --> 1:39:00.060]  worth on average, more than just profits, because they control the crisis. Putin will get richer.
[1:39:00.060 --> 1:39:05.260]  Klaus Schwab will get richer. They'll all get richer and now they use this crisis to do what
[1:39:05.260 --> 1:39:12.780]  they want. And that, my friends, is the rest of the story. All right, for the rest of this hour
[1:39:12.780 --> 1:39:17.980]  and the next hour, I want to go to your phone calls now. We've got a lot of great callers here,
[1:39:17.980 --> 1:39:25.020]  Chris in North Dakota, Daniel in Toronto, Canada, Mehmed in Florida, Tim in Texas, Grant in Australia,
[1:39:25.820 --> 1:39:31.980]  Steve in South Carolina, Brian in Texas, Andrew in Texas, Clayton in Canada. No calls from Europe,
[1:39:31.980 --> 1:39:38.380]  but that's okay, I understand. Let's go ahead and take a call from Australia on the other side
[1:39:38.380 --> 1:39:42.780]  of the world. Grant in Australia, thanks for calling. You're our first caller today. What do you
[1:39:42.780 --> 1:39:51.420]  make of all this? Alex, hi. It's pretty, pretty intense, isn't it? It's wild. First folks were
[1:39:51.420 --> 1:39:54.940]  saying, oh, this isn't a very strong invasion. The footage I'm seeing is it's full scale.
[1:39:54.940 --> 1:40:05.180]  Yeah, yeah. So I've heard there was a news report that Australia, that like war with Ukraine started.
[1:40:08.140 --> 1:40:11.980]  But you asked people to call in about things that they felt were important.
[1:40:12.700 --> 1:40:22.940]  And so I've sort of called in about that. Sorry for about downs. So the main point that I want to
[1:40:22.940 --> 1:40:29.900]  make is I've been writing letters to my local members and to my government officials discussing
[1:40:30.780 --> 1:40:36.300]  the global corporate's plans that they've published to throw government under the bus
[1:40:37.020 --> 1:40:45.260]  when they institute their medical technocracy, one world government. So I've been doing that.
[1:40:45.260 --> 1:40:50.300]  I think that's pretty important. Let them know where they stand in their outcomes.
[1:40:50.300 --> 1:40:55.660]  Well, that's beautiful because that's the key piece of the equation they don't want
[1:40:56.220 --> 1:41:00.860]  is governments that are on the payroll of the WTO and then in the UN need to get,
[1:41:00.860 --> 1:41:04.860]  they're being set up for the fall. They're selling their country out. They're not building
[1:41:04.860 --> 1:41:13.420]  some great utopia. Yeah, that's, that's, I think that's pretty important. So also Australia Post
[1:41:13.420 --> 1:41:19.340]  has stopped processing international parcels. So I can't get my info wars products now.
[1:41:19.340 --> 1:41:24.940]  I'm rationing what I've got out because you know, I don't know when I'll be able to get them.
[1:41:26.460 --> 1:41:31.100]  So I started, I've started to like donate to info wars because I figure if there's anything
[1:41:31.100 --> 1:41:35.820]  that's going to get Australia Post processing those parcels, it's keeping you guys on the air
[1:41:35.820 --> 1:41:41.100]  with donations because I can't get the products. Well, that's it brother. Yeah, there Australia,
[1:41:41.100 --> 1:41:45.100]  as you know, is really getting clamped down. But I've seen a big pushback. When do you think
[1:41:45.100 --> 1:41:50.380]  they're going to back off? Most of the other countries are backing off. Yes. Well, we've had
[1:41:50.380 --> 1:41:57.260]  a bit of a apparently, I don't watch regular news. I'm just, it makes me feel sick. Some people were
[1:41:57.260 --> 1:42:03.740]  saying that our in my area that we don't have to wear masks from today. So, but I'm just waiting
[1:42:03.740 --> 1:42:08.940]  for the problem to ratchet back on even harder. Oh, exactly. Yeah. Now that they know they built
[1:42:08.940 --> 1:42:12.700]  enough opposition to send them to prison, they back off doing we're nice people and we'll kind
[1:42:12.700 --> 1:42:17.020]  of go away. No, now we got to push harder than ever to expose them. And I'm glad you raised that.
[1:42:17.020 --> 1:42:21.580]  I haven't hit the COVID news yet. It's so huge. I want to finish up calls. Then I'm going to get
[1:42:21.580 --> 1:42:29.580]  to that. Thank you so much, sir. Folks, here's the big news. It's all over the place, but it's not
[1:42:29.580 --> 1:42:35.340]  getting a lot of attention. Another major insurance company this time in Germany came out and said
[1:42:35.340 --> 1:42:41.820]  they see similar numbers to the major US insurance companies that are seeing a 40 plus percent
[1:42:41.820 --> 1:42:49.820]  increase in death after the vaccines in 18 to 64. That's working age. And then it gets even more
[1:42:49.820 --> 1:42:55.180]  insane. A major scientific group scan the virus completely confirmed it's manmade. The whole
[1:42:55.180 --> 1:43:04.700]  thing's manmade. So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training probably
[1:43:04.700 --> 1:43:09.500]  not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for info wars
[1:43:09.500 --> 1:43:15.980]  store.com. Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need
[1:43:15.980 --> 1:43:21.260]  to get going. You know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need,
[1:43:21.260 --> 1:43:26.300]  like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for
[1:43:26.300 --> 1:43:31.020]  sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training. And then every day
[1:43:31.020 --> 1:43:37.500]  now I'm taking Dr. Jones, sore less. I have bad joints. Thanks, mom. So this is great for giving
[1:43:37.500 --> 1:43:43.180]  my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[1:43:43.180 --> 1:43:48.460]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training. Even if you're
[1:43:48.460 --> 1:43:53.100]  not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news turbo force that can still give you the
[1:43:53.100 --> 1:44:08.940]  energy and clarity you need for every day and sore less can keep you moving and feeling great at NEH.
[1:44:23.100 --> 1:44:42.540]  I've done some pretty heavy work with the highway department and my friends will attest to the fact
[1:44:42.540 --> 1:44:51.020]  that, yeah, for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70, and I know I'm not just blowing smoke here. The B12 saves my life.
[1:45:02.140 --> 1:45:06.140]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome. Go ahead. Hey, how's it going, Alex? Good, bro.
[1:45:06.140 --> 1:45:11.020]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement. It's basically
[1:45:11.020 --> 1:45:16.140]  the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity. It's
[1:45:16.140 --> 1:45:20.700]  like we're living in a twilight zone. All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling.
[1:45:20.700 --> 1:45:24.380]  Go ahead. Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out
[1:45:24.380 --> 1:45:29.180]  for one of the products. The X2 does wonders. I recommend it to everybody. You're on the fence
[1:45:29.180 --> 1:45:33.980]  about it. Get off the fence, get the product, support the info board. Tyler in Maine, you're
[1:45:33.980 --> 1:45:37.820]  on the air. Thanks for holding. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[1:45:37.820 --> 1:45:43.340]  It's an honor to talk to you. Awesome. So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the product,
[1:45:43.340 --> 1:45:49.340]  alpha power, even at 29. If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[1:45:49.340 --> 1:45:54.140]  So, just number one for a few of you. It definitely works. It's not a joke. Absolutely.
[1:45:58.780 --> 1:46:02.060]  With the world awakening, I think what's important that we were right to prevent them right now,
[1:46:02.060 --> 1:46:05.980]  take advantage of this moment. And I have an idea that something everybody can do,
[1:46:05.980 --> 1:46:09.820]  but every listener can do, I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to, you know,
[1:46:09.820 --> 1:46:14.380]  hang banners over highways. Imagine a giant bean or a piece of a layup made up. It says,
[1:46:14.380 --> 1:46:19.420]  Alex Jones is right in the Warstock Farm. We stand with the truckers. We'll rest out or whatever.
[1:46:19.420 --> 1:46:24.140]  Brother, I'm so glad you called. Elaborate on this. Yes. Now is the time in your small town
[1:46:24.140 --> 1:46:28.460]  or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on your car
[1:46:28.460 --> 1:46:34.060]  or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain reaction. What do you recommend people
[1:46:34.060 --> 1:46:39.020]  say on these banner hangs? I have a few ideas. First of all, I hope that the warstock farm,
[1:46:39.020 --> 1:46:43.020]  rest out, rest out, swap. The vaccine is poison. There's tons of things. I said,
[1:46:43.020 --> 1:46:47.740]  keep it short. Keep it concise. I agree. Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates. The COVID
[1:46:47.740 --> 1:46:51.740]  Vax is poison. Beautiful. Yeah. There's ways that we could all be involved as we could all be
[1:46:51.740 --> 1:46:55.740]  effective. So that's what I'm calling about. God bless you, Chris. In Atlanta, I really,
[1:46:55.740 --> 1:46:58.460]  really appreciate you calling us today. Thank you so much.
[1:46:58.460 --> 1:47:05.820]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:28.860 --> 1:47:34.620]  You know, you don't get the answers over at CNN.
[1:47:37.820 --> 1:47:39.420]  Till you tune into info wars.
[1:47:39.420 --> 1:47:55.580]  You asked Bobby Dylan. You asked the Beatles. You didn't ask us.
[1:48:10.380 --> 1:48:11.740]  They call me the seeker.
[1:48:19.100 --> 1:48:22.620]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live taking your phone calls, but Biden just
[1:48:22.620 --> 1:48:27.340]  started speaking. So please be patient callers. I love you, Larissa and Virginia and everybody
[1:48:27.340 --> 1:48:30.620]  else. I'm going to get to you in a moment, but let's, let's hear some of Biden if he can get
[1:48:30.620 --> 1:48:35.580]  his words thrown together. Here it is. Sorry to keep you waiting.
[1:48:35.580 --> 1:48:43.660]  Good afternoon. The Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine
[1:48:44.620 --> 1:48:52.060]  without provocation, without justification, without necessity. This is a premeditated attack.
[1:48:53.180 --> 1:48:57.020]  Vladimir Putin has been planning this for months as we've been saying all along.
[1:48:57.020 --> 1:48:58.140]  Like shutting the keystone down.
[1:48:58.140 --> 1:49:01.180]  They moved more than 175,000 troops.
[1:49:01.180 --> 1:49:03.340]  1,000 millions in the U.S.
[1:49:03.340 --> 1:49:04.620]  Along the Ukrainian border.
[1:49:04.620 --> 1:49:05.420]  Put up with the border.
[1:49:05.420 --> 1:49:07.340]  He moved blood supplies into position.
[1:49:07.340 --> 1:49:08.700]  You mean pedophiles and schools.
[1:49:08.700 --> 1:49:09.500]  Field hospitals.
[1:49:09.500 --> 1:49:11.020]  You fund a black lives matter to burn down cities.
[1:49:11.020 --> 1:49:13.580]  Which tells you all you need to know about his intentions.
[1:49:13.580 --> 1:49:14.940]  All we know about you.
[1:49:14.940 --> 1:49:19.500]  He rejected every good faith effort the United States and our allies and partners made
[1:49:19.500 --> 1:49:20.220]  to address our.
[1:49:20.220 --> 1:49:21.340]  Every good faith effort,
[1:49:21.340 --> 1:49:26.700]  shipping $5 billion to dial on to avoid needless conflict and avert human suffering.
[1:49:26.700 --> 1:49:28.620]  Oh yeah, the U.S. government is doing that.
[1:49:28.620 --> 1:49:32.140]  For weeks, we have been warning that this would happen.
[1:49:32.140 --> 1:49:35.740]  And now it's unfolding largely as we predicted.
[1:49:35.740 --> 1:49:40.140]  And I love how they do the sign language as a virtue signal when all TVs and phones
[1:49:40.140 --> 1:49:41.340]  have closed captions.
[1:49:41.340 --> 1:49:42.940]  It's just some weird leftist thing.
[1:49:42.940 --> 1:49:44.300]  Like, look, we don't just have him talking.
[1:49:44.300 --> 1:49:44.940]  We do this.
[1:49:44.940 --> 1:49:46.140]  You feel like we're close.
[1:49:46.140 --> 1:49:46.940]  Look, we're good.
[1:49:46.940 --> 1:49:49.820]  We added that cyber attacks against Ukraine.
[1:49:49.820 --> 1:49:50.940]  It's called BS.
[1:49:50.940 --> 1:49:57.180]  We saw a staged political theater in Moscow outlandish and baseless claims that Ukraine
[1:49:57.180 --> 1:50:04.060]  was a Ukraine was about to invade and launch a war against Russia that Ukraine was prepared
[1:50:04.060 --> 1:50:05.500]  to use chemical weapons.
[1:50:05.500 --> 1:50:07.660]  The Ukraine committed a genocide.
[1:50:07.660 --> 1:50:10.060]  This is everything they say evidence.
[1:50:10.780 --> 1:50:15.100]  We saw a flagrant violation of international Iraq hit pause.
[1:50:15.100 --> 1:50:21.260]  You know, even if Putin's bad, let's just say he is for the for the point of debate.
[1:50:22.380 --> 1:50:24.860]  Everything he's doing is what he learned from America.
[1:50:24.860 --> 1:50:27.660]  False flags, lying, saying there's WMDs.
[1:50:27.660 --> 1:50:35.500]  I mean, he learned that from Obama and Clinton and W continue to create two new so-called
[1:50:35.500 --> 1:50:39.340]  republics on sovereign Ukrainian territory.
[1:50:39.340 --> 1:50:40.380]  It's possible.
[1:50:40.380 --> 1:50:47.660]  Sovereign, the left teaches no borders, no walls, no USA at all, and we don't have
[1:50:47.660 --> 1:50:49.100]  borders and they shouldn't exist.
[1:50:49.100 --> 1:50:55.500]  But now sovereign Ukrainian territory, which was part of Russia for 1,000 years, continue.
[1:50:55.500 --> 1:51:00.460]  And at the very moment that the United Nations Security Council was meeting to stand up for
[1:51:00.460 --> 1:51:05.900]  Ukraine sovereignty, to stave off invasion, Putin declared his war.
[1:51:05.900 --> 1:51:12.700]  Within moments, moments, missile strikes began to fall on historic cities across Ukraine.
[1:51:12.700 --> 1:51:14.620]  Then came the air pause.
[1:51:14.620 --> 1:51:19.260]  American historic cities get pulled down, American historic monuments get pulled down,
[1:51:19.260 --> 1:51:21.820]  American plays and books get banned.
[1:51:21.820 --> 1:51:25.820]  Oh, but now history matters when it's military equipment being blown up.
[1:51:25.820 --> 1:51:27.020]  I'm not even defending Putin.
[1:51:27.020 --> 1:51:33.020]  I'm just this this vomit, this diarrhea spraying out of his mouth is too much to handle.
[1:51:33.020 --> 1:51:33.580]  Continue.
[1:51:34.540 --> 1:51:36.700]  Followed by tanks and troops rolling in.
[1:51:37.580 --> 1:51:40.060]  We've been transparent with the world.
[1:51:40.060 --> 1:51:44.780]  We've shared declassified evidence about Russia's plans and cyber attacks and false
[1:51:44.780 --> 1:51:50.220]  pretexts so that there could be no confusion or cover up about what Putin was doing.
[1:51:51.020 --> 1:51:53.180]  Putin is the aggressor.
[1:51:54.060 --> 1:51:56.060]  Putin chose this war.
[1:51:56.060 --> 1:51:58.060]  And now he in his country.
[1:51:58.060 --> 1:52:02.460]  Yeah, if I move in on your doorstep and I just say, I'm going to live on your porch now.
[1:52:02.460 --> 1:52:05.900]  And then I aim a machine gun at you when you walk out your door every day.
[1:52:05.900 --> 1:52:07.020]  It's a machine gun.
[1:52:07.020 --> 1:52:10.620]  At you when you walk out your door every day, it's actually true.
[1:52:11.500 --> 1:52:14.700]  If you finally walked out and punched the dude in the face that aims a machine gun at you,
[1:52:14.700 --> 1:52:15.740]  you're the aggressor.
[1:52:15.740 --> 1:52:18.780]  I mean, I mean, really, anybody buy this crap.
[1:52:19.420 --> 1:52:20.220]  It's just not true.
[1:52:21.260 --> 1:52:23.580]  In all the videos, we're going to kick Russia's ass.
[1:52:23.580 --> 1:52:24.700]  We're going to blow them up.
[1:52:24.700 --> 1:52:26.780]  Oh, the State Department tweeting photos.
[1:52:26.780 --> 1:52:30.060]  We just delivered a thousand anti-aircraft missiles.
[1:52:30.060 --> 1:52:31.820]  We just delivered 500 today.
[1:52:31.820 --> 1:52:34.060]  We're delivering more next week of javelins.
[1:52:34.060 --> 1:52:35.180]  We're going to blow your tanks up.
[1:52:35.180 --> 1:52:38.540]  We're going to frickin' take your ass out on the doorstep.
[1:52:38.540 --> 1:52:39.900]  Like, in your face, I'm going to kick your ass.
[1:52:39.900 --> 1:52:40.860]  I'm going to kick your ass.
[1:52:40.860 --> 1:52:41.740]  I'm going to kick your ass.
[1:52:41.740 --> 1:52:43.020]  I'm going to kick your ass.
[1:52:43.020 --> 1:52:44.780]  Oh, I mean, you do that long enough, man.
[1:52:45.420 --> 1:52:46.460]  OK, we're going to kick my ass.
[1:52:46.460 --> 1:52:47.500]  But I ain't going to sit there and take it.
[1:52:48.060 --> 1:52:52.940]  And of course, usually what the guy says to kick your ass doesn't get the ass kicked.
[1:52:52.940 --> 1:52:54.060]  He gets his ass kicked.
[1:52:54.060 --> 1:52:57.820]  And that's where this is all going, folks, with this idiot.
[1:52:57.820 --> 1:52:58.460]  Let's continue.
[1:52:59.420 --> 1:53:00.620]  Here are the consequences.
[1:53:01.420 --> 1:53:04.220]  Today, I'm authorizing additional strong sanctions.
[1:53:04.220 --> 1:53:07.740]  And new limitations on what can be exported to Europe.
[1:53:07.740 --> 1:53:09.100]  OK, I can't listen anymore of it.
[1:53:09.100 --> 1:53:12.220]  And of course, Klaus Schwab loves that, because I'll just shut down the economy more.
[1:53:12.220 --> 1:53:13.980]  And I wish Russia wouldn't have invaded.
[1:53:15.100 --> 1:53:16.940]  And I wish they wouldn't have done their counter-sexes.
[1:53:16.940 --> 1:53:17.660]  This is going to hurt everybody.
[1:53:17.660 --> 1:53:18.700]  But we are now here.
[1:53:19.500 --> 1:53:26.060]  Now, let me treat you to Pelosi, where she's saying a country in a whole different area
[1:53:26.060 --> 1:53:27.820]  of Europe is Ukraine.
[1:53:27.820 --> 1:53:31.820]  She doesn't even know the country of Ukraine.
[1:53:31.820 --> 1:53:33.820]  And she says a totally different country.
[1:53:33.820 --> 1:54:01.820]  Here it is.
[1:54:04.300 --> 1:54:06.860]  So you heard Russia invaded Hungary, right?
[1:54:08.620 --> 1:54:13.980]  What do you think foreign leaders think when they see a literal witch who's obviously on
[1:54:13.980 --> 1:54:19.100]  four or five Adderall in a gallon of vodka doesn't know what planet she's on?
[1:54:19.820 --> 1:54:21.180]  Is a Chinese puppet?
[1:54:23.420 --> 1:54:25.020]  And she's saying Putin invaded Hungary.
[1:54:25.580 --> 1:54:29.340]  That is the speaker of the House of Representatives.
[1:54:29.340 --> 1:54:32.780]  And that's why our country and our world is in so much trouble.
[1:54:32.780 --> 1:54:34.620]  All right, we got loaded phones.
[1:54:34.620 --> 1:54:36.220]  I'll at least get to these 11 calls.
[1:54:37.340 --> 1:54:38.540]  Who's been holding the longest?
[1:54:43.580 --> 1:54:45.340]  Will that be Larissa in Virginia?
[1:54:45.340 --> 1:54:47.660]  No, that would be Tim in Texas.
[1:54:48.220 --> 1:54:51.020]  Tim in Texas has got friends that live in Ukraine.
[1:54:51.020 --> 1:54:52.060]  He's got his take on it.
[1:54:52.060 --> 1:54:52.540]  What do you think?
[1:54:55.180 --> 1:54:55.580]  Hello?
[1:54:56.300 --> 1:54:57.660]  Hey, brother, how you doing?
[1:54:59.100 --> 1:54:59.820]  Hi, Alex.
[1:54:59.820 --> 1:55:06.700]  I have a cousin over in Ukraine, and the fact of the matter is what's going on over there.
[1:55:06.700 --> 1:55:07.820]  We know it's terrible.
[1:55:08.380 --> 1:55:12.620]  And I told him I was on hold with you, and he wanted me to personally ask you,
[1:55:13.340 --> 1:55:16.460]  why do you keep banning accounts off your Band-Aught video?
[1:55:16.460 --> 1:55:19.980]  He just, he does all this research about the truth.
[1:55:19.980 --> 1:55:21.980]  Listen, brother, I appreciate your call.
[1:55:21.980 --> 1:55:26.700]  We don't screen your calls and we don't screen stuff on Band-Aught video.
[1:55:26.700 --> 1:55:28.540]  There's like some keywords and things that are banned,
[1:55:28.540 --> 1:55:32.460]  like the N-word and stuff, and calling for killing people and stuff.
[1:55:32.460 --> 1:55:37.020]  Believe me, I don't have people even on Band-Aught video.
[1:55:37.020 --> 1:55:43.020]  It's like algorithm thing of words of kill, murder, with another word.
[1:55:43.020 --> 1:55:46.940]  So in the middle of these war-starting, with all this happening,
[1:55:46.940 --> 1:55:49.980]  you call in to give us your take on this war-starting,
[1:55:49.980 --> 1:55:51.980]  and it's about how we're censoring people.
[1:55:53.020 --> 1:55:54.780]  Five, it makes you feel morally superior.
[1:55:54.780 --> 1:55:56.300]  I censor everybody.
[1:55:56.300 --> 1:55:59.180]  In fact, I love CNN, I love Brian Stelzer.
[1:55:59.180 --> 1:56:02.540]  I'm censoring everybody constantly, sir.
[1:56:03.500 --> 1:56:04.460]  No, but none of that's true.
[1:56:05.660 --> 1:56:07.580]  I can't even take the messages on my phone.
[1:56:08.220 --> 1:56:10.620]  I don't have time to hardly update my insurance.
[1:56:11.260 --> 1:56:12.620]  I've got a tiny crew here.
[1:56:12.620 --> 1:56:17.020]  We're not peering at Band-Aught video, but does Band-Aught video get slow sometimes?
[1:56:17.020 --> 1:56:18.380]  Does it lock up sometimes?
[1:56:18.380 --> 1:56:20.780]  Because I'll see like comments like, why am I being censored?
[1:56:20.780 --> 1:56:21.980]  Why am I being censored?
[1:56:21.980 --> 1:56:23.180]  Why am I being censored?
[1:56:23.180 --> 1:56:25.020]  Because your thing didn't go right through.
[1:56:25.020 --> 1:56:27.900]  Sorry, we're not instant ratification like Google.
[1:56:27.900 --> 1:56:28.460]  Don't worry.
[1:56:28.460 --> 1:56:31.900]  We may not be here soon, and you won't have us to kick around.
[1:56:32.540 --> 1:56:34.860]  The little babies that call in sometimes.
[1:56:35.580 --> 1:56:40.540]  And my cousin, he can't comment because you're censoring him.
[1:56:40.540 --> 1:56:42.300]  You're on air, jackass.
[1:56:43.260 --> 1:56:44.380]  You can talk.
[1:56:44.380 --> 1:56:45.820]  You can say what you want.
[1:56:45.820 --> 1:56:47.260]  You're not being censored.
[1:56:47.260 --> 1:56:48.380]  You liar.
[1:56:49.020 --> 1:56:50.860]  That is my cardinal rule, man.
[1:56:50.860 --> 1:56:52.380]  I had a talk show host work here.
[1:56:52.380 --> 1:56:54.940]  I fired him because he was on air saying he was a censored.
[1:56:54.940 --> 1:56:58.620]  May I be struck down by lightning if I ever censored that person?
[1:56:59.180 --> 1:57:00.620]  On my children, I didn't.
[1:57:00.620 --> 1:57:04.380]  But that's all they've got is they're censored by Alex Jones.
[1:57:04.380 --> 1:57:06.540]  Because that's the ultimate thing.
[1:57:06.540 --> 1:57:10.540]  Oh, they're pure, and you're bad, and you're censoring them.
[1:57:11.820 --> 1:57:15.020]  And all they try to do is use the comments to set us up and send me to jail.
[1:57:15.020 --> 1:57:19.100]  They try to put porn links on there, child porn links on there, all this crap.
[1:57:19.100 --> 1:57:23.420]  But we still battle to get you the comments on In Full Wars, Band-Aught video.
[1:57:23.420 --> 1:57:26.140]  But it ain't good enough for the big man that called up.
[1:57:26.140 --> 1:57:27.820]  Because he's better than Alex Jones.
[1:57:27.820 --> 1:57:29.020]  He's pure.
[1:57:29.020 --> 1:57:30.220]  He's good.
[1:57:30.220 --> 1:57:34.700]  He confronts the Alex Jones that he's trying to stop the people.
[1:57:35.500 --> 1:57:36.620]  What a load of hell.
[1:57:38.620 --> 1:57:39.740]  Thanks for waking me up, though.
[1:57:40.220 --> 1:57:43.260]  Hour number three, your phone calls in more.
[1:57:43.260 --> 1:57:45.740]  Straight ahead, infowars.com.
[1:57:48.460 --> 1:57:50.620]  I've been on air more than 25 years.
[1:57:50.620 --> 1:57:55.660]  And long before I started selling high-quality vitamin D3 eight years ago,
[1:57:55.660 --> 1:58:01.260]  I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[1:58:01.260 --> 1:58:05.900]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're black or white or Hispanic,
[1:58:05.900 --> 1:58:06.620]  it doesn't matter.
[1:58:06.620 --> 1:58:11.340]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that are out there.
[1:58:11.340 --> 1:58:12.860]  It's just like you need oxygen.
[1:58:12.860 --> 1:58:14.620]  You die in four minutes without oxygen.
[1:58:14.620 --> 1:58:17.180]  You die in five or six days without water.
[1:58:17.180 --> 1:58:18.620]  You die in a month without food.
[1:58:18.620 --> 1:58:24.620]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that you need.
[1:58:24.620 --> 1:58:29.260]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D3.
[1:58:29.260 --> 1:58:34.300]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's

[1:58:43.500 --> 1:58:49.820]  This is the best quality out there and it funds the info war 50% off.
[1:58:49.820 --> 1:58:50.540]  So I did it.
[1:58:50.540 --> 1:58:52.700]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[1:58:52.700 --> 1:58:57.340]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[1:58:57.340 --> 1:59:00.220]  and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com.
[1:59:00.220 --> 1:59:05.580]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to
[1:59:05.580 --> 1:59:06.060]  get going.
[1:59:06.060 --> 1:59:11.420]  You know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin
[1:59:11.420 --> 1:59:16.940]  C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy
[1:59:16.940 --> 1:59:19.740]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[1:59:19.740 --> 1:59:23.420]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones' sore list.
[1:59:23.420 --> 1:59:24.700]  I have bad joints.
[1:59:24.700 --> 1:59:25.580]  Thanks mom.
[1:59:25.580 --> 1:59:30.460]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation
[1:59:30.460 --> 1:59:32.620]  support and extra flexibility.
[1:59:32.620 --> 1:59:37.020]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[1:59:37.020 --> 1:59:41.980]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news turbo force that can
[1:59:41.980 --> 1:59:45.980]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and sore list can keep
[1:59:45.980 --> 1:59:47.980]  you moving and feeling great at any age.
[1:59:47.980 --> 2:00:07.980]  How does it feel now to watch it burn, burn, burn?
[2:00:17.980 --> 2:00:41.980]  We're getting your phone calls right now.
[2:00:41.980 --> 2:00:45.980]  We're going to Mohammed, Florida, then Larissa in Virginia and many others.
[2:00:45.980 --> 2:00:48.220]  Thank you for holding sir, go ahead.
[2:00:48.220 --> 2:00:50.220]  Hi Alex, I just had a comment.
[2:00:50.220 --> 2:00:54.380]  You said that Biden was telling the truth about Russia.
[2:00:55.180 --> 2:00:58.540]  Biden literally invited Russia to invade Ukraine.
[2:00:58.540 --> 2:01:00.780]  Ukraine was telling Biden to shut up.
[2:01:00.780 --> 2:01:02.620]  They were asking him, why are you talking?
[2:01:02.620 --> 2:01:03.820]  Why don't you just be quiet?
[2:01:03.820 --> 2:01:06.860]  It was an invitation for Russia to invade.
[2:01:06.860 --> 2:01:10.300]  They needed a boogeyman and Russia now is a boogeyman.
[2:01:10.300 --> 2:01:15.420]  So when the power goes out, when the lights go out, when the internet goes down,
[2:01:15.420 --> 2:01:16.780]  that's going to be Russia's fault.
[2:01:18.460 --> 2:01:21.660]  No, I totally agree with you and I should start the whole show with this.
[2:01:21.660 --> 2:01:26.220]  In fact, I'm going to take your call when we archive today's show and put it,
[2:01:26.220 --> 2:01:27.180]  put it out guys, please.
[2:01:28.300 --> 2:01:31.340]  I want you to have the floor for a few minutes because I meant to start the show with this
[2:01:31.900 --> 2:01:35.340]  and say that you really think Biden's controllers are that dumb
[2:01:35.340 --> 2:01:37.180]  that they would tell Russia, go ahead and invade.
[2:01:37.180 --> 2:01:41.020]  We won't do anything so they could have an excuse for the great reset
[2:01:41.020 --> 2:01:44.780]  and collapse in the economy and then launching a bunch of stuff and blaming it on Russia
[2:01:44.780 --> 2:01:46.140]  and launching a new Cold War.
[2:01:46.140 --> 2:01:48.460]  And the question is, is Putin in on that?
[2:01:48.460 --> 2:01:51.740]  And I can tell you some of the folks I know, they're high-level military.
[2:01:51.740 --> 2:01:54.940]  They actually believe Putin's got a double deal behind the scenes.
[2:01:55.660 --> 2:02:01.340]  I was just in the main making the statement, Muhammad, that, okay,
[2:02:01.340 --> 2:02:06.220]  they did say Russia was going to invade and they did just to put that out there.
[2:02:06.220 --> 2:02:08.060]  But obviously there's a lot of manipulation.
[2:02:08.060 --> 2:02:09.500]  So we got three minutes to break.
[2:02:09.500 --> 2:02:10.220]  You've got the floor.
[2:02:10.220 --> 2:02:12.700]  Tell us, start over, Muhammad, and tell us what's really happening.
[2:02:12.700 --> 2:02:19.580]  Yeah, so literally it was an invitation for Russia to invade Ukraine.
[2:02:19.580 --> 2:02:26.780]  And the fact that Biden has destroyed a petroleum industry and gave Russia's
[2:02:26.780 --> 2:02:33.020]  energy so lucrative, Russia's energy, the cost of Russia's energy has gone.
[2:02:33.020 --> 2:02:34.380]  Again, brother, I apologize.
[2:02:34.380 --> 2:02:35.420]  You're going to get the floor now.
[2:02:35.420 --> 2:02:37.180]  I didn't know my mic was on.
[2:02:37.180 --> 2:02:39.340]  I was telling them, put a clip of this in front of the show.
[2:02:39.340 --> 2:02:40.620]  This is third time's a charm.
[2:02:40.620 --> 2:02:42.860]  Start over again. Okay.
[2:02:42.860 --> 2:02:46.300]  So yeah, so Russia was literally invited into Ukraine.
[2:02:46.300 --> 2:02:47.340]  They need a boogeyman.
[2:02:47.980 --> 2:02:53.020]  Russia, they're already talking about how Russia does cyber attacks in Ukraine.
[2:02:53.020 --> 2:02:56.860]  This is going to lead into Russia doing cyber attacks in the United States.
[2:02:56.860 --> 2:03:00.300]  One of the most important things they want to do is bring down the Internet.
[2:03:00.300 --> 2:03:02.780]  The Internet is a core of the financial system.
[2:03:02.780 --> 2:03:05.340]  The Internet is a core of communication.
[2:03:05.340 --> 2:03:06.940]  They need to bring down the Internet.
[2:03:06.940 --> 2:03:09.820]  Russia will be blamed for bringing down the Internet.
[2:03:09.820 --> 2:03:15.740]  And then it is also going to be a smokescreen for China to invade Taiwan.
[2:03:16.300 --> 2:03:21.340]  The most important thing to understand is that everything tends towards China.
[2:03:22.300 --> 2:03:24.940]  The Clintons, the Bidens have been paid by China.
[2:03:24.940 --> 2:03:26.220]  They are agents of China.
[2:03:26.780 --> 2:03:32.140]  The China trade bill, which Clinton signed, literally took all our industry overnight
[2:03:32.140 --> 2:03:33.340]  and shipped it to China.
[2:03:33.900 --> 2:03:38.780]  That China trade bill was the most important bill signed in the history of the United States.
[2:03:38.780 --> 2:03:45.340]  These are agents of China, and China is going to dominate the world, already dominating Africa.
[2:03:46.140 --> 2:03:49.900]  The vaccines that we're getting here have been given in Africa for years.
[2:03:50.940 --> 2:03:55.020]  In 10 or 15 years, you won't see any blacks in Africa.
[2:03:55.020 --> 2:03:56.620]  They will all be Chinese.
[2:03:56.620 --> 2:03:57.740]  They're already in there.
[2:03:58.620 --> 2:04:01.100]  Our country is being invaded by the Chinese.
[2:04:03.180 --> 2:04:07.740]  If you look at the post office, many of the people that are running the post office are Chinese.
[2:04:07.740 --> 2:04:09.180]  They have access.
[2:04:10.060 --> 2:04:16.780]  And one of the most important reasons why the post office is exempt from the vaccines
[2:04:16.780 --> 2:04:22.780]  is because the post office is the source of how they are planning these fraudulent elections
[2:04:22.780 --> 2:04:24.140]  through these mail-in ballots.
[2:04:25.020 --> 2:04:26.860]  These are all fraudulent ballots.
[2:04:26.860 --> 2:04:28.140]  The Chinese are running it.
[2:04:28.860 --> 2:04:36.300]  And this war with Russia is a smokescreen for China to come into our country,
[2:04:36.300 --> 2:04:41.020]  to go into other countries, and to put all the blame and all the focus on Russia.
[2:04:41.020 --> 2:04:43.020]  Our internet will be going down soon.
[2:04:43.020 --> 2:04:44.460]  Our power will be going out.
[2:04:45.340 --> 2:04:47.900]  And we will have a boogeyman in Russia to blame.
[2:04:47.900 --> 2:04:51.100]  This is the purpose of this act.
[2:04:51.100 --> 2:04:51.740]  Absolutely.
[2:04:51.740 --> 2:04:53.660]  And now they'll blame Russia for everything that bad that happens.
[2:04:53.660 --> 2:04:55.500]  I think Putin just walked into a trap.
[2:04:58.620 --> 2:05:04.940]  Two, life-changing, life-empowering products are now back in stock
[2:05:04.940 --> 2:05:08.460]  after being sold out for months at infowarstore.com.
[2:05:09.100 --> 2:05:13.100]  Winter sun is the highest quality organic vitamin D3 taken under the tongue.
[2:05:13.100 --> 2:05:16.940]  It also has vitamin K, critical fear immune system, and so much more.
[2:05:16.940 --> 2:05:20.300]  It's 50% off, despite the fact it's going to sell out very, very quickly,
[2:05:20.300 --> 2:05:23.500]  because everybody needs this old, young, black, white.
[2:05:23.500 --> 2:05:24.220]  It doesn't matter.
[2:05:24.220 --> 2:05:25.900]  You need what's in winter sun.
[2:05:25.900 --> 2:05:31.500]  And then we have brain force, ultra, super fast acting, amazing, clean,
[2:05:31.500 --> 2:05:38.540]  new, tropic system that is a compliment to brain force plus, and of course turbo force.
[2:05:38.540 --> 2:05:42.620]  All three of these are different formulas, but all three of them take your mind
[2:05:42.620 --> 2:05:45.980]  and take your focus and clarity and alertness to the next level.
[2:05:45.980 --> 2:05:50.860]  It is 40% off at infowarstore.com for a limited time.
[2:05:50.860 --> 2:05:52.380]  Thank you all for your support.
[2:05:52.380 --> 2:05:55.260]  If you haven't tried these products, you really need to because they are amazing.
[2:05:55.260 --> 2:06:04.060]  infowarstore.com
[2:06:14.300 --> 2:06:20.540]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:20.540 --> 2:06:24.780]  So we don't want to get target fixation.
[2:06:26.300 --> 2:06:33.180]  That's where in World War II they have a spitfire, a P-38 Mustang, flying over a train
[2:06:33.180 --> 2:06:37.900]  or a column of tanks, and they would just start firing their cannons or firing their machine guns
[2:06:37.900 --> 2:06:42.060]  and not think about it and just fly right into their target because you get so focused on
[2:06:42.860 --> 2:06:43.820]  taking the enemy out.
[2:06:44.380 --> 2:06:49.580]  We get focused all day on Russia and why Russia was founded in Ukraine,
[2:06:49.580 --> 2:06:53.980]  the Western and weapons, and they want it and all the rest of it, but what's it doing to global
[2:06:53.980 --> 2:06:57.180]  markets continuing to collapse things, the Great Reset?
[2:06:59.020 --> 2:07:02.860]  And that's something that's really, really important to talk about and understand.
[2:07:02.860 --> 2:07:06.940]  And how does that help China now move in against Taiwan and others?
[2:07:06.940 --> 2:07:11.660]  Because there's a globalist group above all this, and now you've got Klaus Schwab.
[2:07:11.660 --> 2:07:12.300]  We have the clip.
[2:07:12.300 --> 2:07:12.940]  I want to go to calls.
[2:07:12.940 --> 2:07:13.900]  I want to play Klaus Schwab.
[2:07:13.900 --> 2:07:20.220]  It's a short clip, last year, saying this cyber attack is what is coming.
[2:07:20.860 --> 2:07:24.780]  Israel makes it COVID-19, look like nothing in comparison.
[2:07:25.340 --> 2:07:26.700]  Power will be out.
[2:07:27.580 --> 2:07:29.980]  And then everything they're doing is around that.
[2:07:29.980 --> 2:07:32.060]  And now they're saying the Russians are going to cut our power.
[2:07:32.780 --> 2:07:38.300]  So Biden's in clips saying, oh, last week, this week, today, we're not going to fight back
[2:07:38.300 --> 2:07:39.980]  against the Russians to get them to invade.
[2:07:39.980 --> 2:07:43.180]  And like I said, I think the Russians have been led into a trap.
[2:07:44.220 --> 2:07:44.860]  I really do.
[2:07:45.820 --> 2:07:47.020]  Here is a Klaus Schwab.
[2:07:48.220 --> 2:07:56.460]  We all know, but still pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario
[2:07:57.020 --> 2:08:05.500]  of a comprehensive cyber attack, which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply,
[2:08:05.500 --> 2:08:10.940]  transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[2:08:11.820 --> 2:08:20.620]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison
[2:08:21.820 --> 2:08:30.780]  to a major cyber attack, to use the COVID-19 crisis as a timely opportunity
[2:08:30.780 --> 2:08:40.460]  to reflect on the lessons the cybersecurity community can draw and improve our unpreparedness
[2:08:41.020 --> 2:08:43.500]  for a potential cyber pandemic.
[2:08:44.620 --> 2:08:47.420]  That's July 8, 2020, actually, so year and a half ago.
[2:08:48.220 --> 2:08:51.740]  Translated, give me full control, give me absolutely everything or I'll turn your power off.
[2:08:51.740 --> 2:08:52.700]  I've got an article here.
[2:08:52.700 --> 2:08:53.820]  In fact, I've already lost it.
[2:08:53.820 --> 2:08:54.620]  I had it.
[2:08:55.100 --> 2:08:56.060]  Oh, here it is.
[2:08:56.060 --> 2:08:56.540]  I found it.
[2:08:56.540 --> 2:09:03.340]  Electric vehicle charging prices in Munich expected to rise as much as 81% as electricity
[2:09:03.340 --> 2:09:09.340]  prices go up because your electricity comes from fossil fuels.
[2:09:09.340 --> 2:09:15.900]  But oh, you're so avant-garde with an electrical vehicle when on average half the power is lost
[2:09:15.900 --> 2:09:21.420]  from the generation station to the battery and it takes more carbon to build the car.
[2:09:21.420 --> 2:09:25.420]  Even if you believe all that, it's unbelievable.
[2:09:25.420 --> 2:09:28.620]  It's unbelievable how people just buy into the city, you see.
[2:09:31.180 --> 2:09:33.900]  All right, let's go to Larissa in Virginia.
[2:09:33.900 --> 2:09:36.220]  Larissa, thank you for calling and holding her on the air.
[2:09:37.420 --> 2:09:38.060]  Hi, Alex.
[2:09:38.060 --> 2:09:39.660]  It's the first time I'm talking to you.
[2:09:39.660 --> 2:09:40.620]  I did call before.
[2:09:41.420 --> 2:09:45.020]  Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to speak on your platform.
[2:09:45.020 --> 2:09:47.900]  I just want to express my own opinion.
[2:09:47.900 --> 2:09:52.300]  So some people maybe disagree, even most public people.
[2:09:52.940 --> 2:09:53.580]  But that's okay.
[2:09:53.580 --> 2:09:54.860]  You're allowed to have your free speech.
[2:09:54.860 --> 2:09:55.740]  I don't know what you're about to say.
[2:09:55.740 --> 2:09:56.380]  Go ahead and say it.
[2:09:57.180 --> 2:09:57.580]  Thank you.
[2:09:58.140 --> 2:10:03.580]  For example, we all need to go back in 2014, February, when during Obama time,
[2:10:03.580 --> 2:10:06.140]  they committed a turnover of the government.
[2:10:06.140 --> 2:10:08.700]  They call it Maidan Revolution.
[2:10:09.660 --> 2:10:15.260]  And that's when the legitimate president Yanukovych was removed and targeted for death.
[2:10:15.260 --> 2:10:20.460]  But Putin actually airlifted him in Crimea to save him and his family.
[2:10:20.460 --> 2:10:21.980]  And that's what happened.
[2:10:21.980 --> 2:10:27.900]  Now, next thing is, when they had that Maidan, they had snipers like we had on January 6th.
[2:10:27.900 --> 2:10:28.540]  Everything.
[2:10:28.540 --> 2:10:33.420]  And Newland, what in the world was she doing, giving cookies to all these people?
[2:10:33.420 --> 2:10:34.940]  I heard they were paid to be there.
[2:10:35.580 --> 2:10:41.020]  But anyway, whatever happened, they put their regime in the Ukraine government.
[2:10:41.020 --> 2:10:41.900]  Okay.
[2:10:41.900 --> 2:10:44.940]  And they selected a millionaire, Poroshenko.
[2:10:45.580 --> 2:10:51.100]  So then some of the regions, the speaking Russian regions like Odessa,
[2:10:51.100 --> 2:10:56.780]  Kharkov, Lugansk, Donetsk, Militopol, Mariupol, all of these people were not happy.
[2:10:56.780 --> 2:11:00.220]  And they fought back just like what we do right now with the government.
[2:11:00.220 --> 2:11:01.340]  We are not happy, right?
[2:11:02.060 --> 2:11:07.260]  And so these people, some of them were fighting and some of them were repressed and some of
[2:11:07.260 --> 2:11:08.140]  them were killed.
[2:11:08.140 --> 2:11:10.140]  And they had all kinds of terror attacks.
[2:11:10.140 --> 2:11:15.020]  And for example, nobody ever talks about what happened in Mariupol when they killed
[2:11:15.020 --> 2:11:18.300]  like over 20 police people locally.
[2:11:18.300 --> 2:11:22.540]  Nobody wants to talk about Odessa.
[2:11:22.540 --> 2:11:27.100]  Odessa, when that was actually May 2nd, when they burned people alive.
[2:11:27.100 --> 2:11:30.220]  That was a major genocide and nobody's prosecuted.
[2:11:30.220 --> 2:11:31.580]  Nobody's looking for those people.
[2:11:31.580 --> 2:11:32.780]  They burned.
[2:11:34.140 --> 2:11:38.300]  They claim officially 48 people alive in that building.
[2:11:38.300 --> 2:11:40.540]  It's called Prafeyuz building.
[2:11:41.420 --> 2:11:47.900]  So the only two regions that were able to stand this aggression were Lugansk and Donetsk.
[2:11:47.900 --> 2:11:51.500]  Because they had a little time and they had more patriotism ongoing.
[2:11:52.140 --> 2:11:54.780]  And so let's see.
[2:11:57.420 --> 2:11:57.660]  Sure.
[2:11:57.660 --> 2:12:02.780]  It's on record that there was a NATO back over the country and people are pissed off.
[2:12:04.060 --> 2:12:06.860]  Well, yeah, yeah, especially people were fighting back.
[2:12:06.860 --> 2:12:07.980]  They did not want that.
[2:12:07.980 --> 2:12:09.820]  They did not want that government.
[2:12:09.820 --> 2:12:12.940]  They knew what's coming because I know I was there.
[2:12:12.940 --> 2:12:19.580]  I have the Ukrainian passport myself and I was at the time when I come to Kiev,
[2:12:19.580 --> 2:12:21.580]  for example, you know, they look at me.
[2:12:21.580 --> 2:12:26.060]  So I'd better say I'm American and not to say my true that I'm actually Russian.
[2:12:26.700 --> 2:12:29.020]  So, but anyway, they do not.
[2:12:29.020 --> 2:12:33.260]  The genocide is going on there for years, for years.
[2:12:33.260 --> 2:12:35.980]  That war with Lugansk and Donetsk for eight years.
[2:12:35.980 --> 2:12:36.780]  They murder it.
[2:12:36.780 --> 2:12:38.140]  Nobody want to talk about.
[2:12:38.140 --> 2:12:38.380]  Sure.
[2:12:38.380 --> 2:12:43.260]  So replay what happened in the Balkans in the 90s is starting there.
[2:12:43.900 --> 2:12:45.500]  Balkans, I don't know about Balkans.
[2:12:45.500 --> 2:12:48.940]  The Balkans, Serbia, the similar thing happened there.
[2:12:48.940 --> 2:12:50.620]  Oh, there, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2:12:50.620 --> 2:12:53.500]  Basically, yeah, because that's exactly what they did in Libya, too.
[2:12:54.540 --> 2:12:56.380]  They just hiding some of the information.
[2:12:56.380 --> 2:12:58.300]  They just say, oh, Putin invaded.
[2:12:58.300 --> 2:13:01.180]  He is defending those people that ask for help.
[2:13:01.180 --> 2:13:06.620]  Where do you see invaders being greeted with the Russian flags and fireworks?
[2:13:06.620 --> 2:13:08.540]  And Russian anthem.
[2:13:09.580 --> 2:13:10.540]  This is not how you.
[2:13:10.540 --> 2:13:11.980]  So where do you think this goes?
[2:13:12.540 --> 2:13:15.260]  Because, you know, now they're going to blame the Russians for any cyber attacks
[2:13:15.260 --> 2:13:16.540]  that Klaus Schwab is going to launch.
[2:13:17.900 --> 2:13:21.020]  Oh, they will certainly use that as a cover because that's why they they
[2:13:21.020 --> 2:13:22.700]  continue to do that over and over.
[2:13:22.700 --> 2:13:26.940]  But I think the last drop of Putin was basically when Zelensky said that he
[2:13:26.940 --> 2:13:28.860]  wants to get nukes this time.
[2:13:28.860 --> 2:13:35.260]  And Zelensky, by the way, in two and a half years of his presidency earned over a billion
[2:13:35.260 --> 2:13:39.020]  dollars and bought himself a mansion in, guess where?
[2:13:39.020 --> 2:13:39.740]  Miami.
[2:13:40.620 --> 2:13:40.860]  Wow.
[2:13:41.420 --> 2:13:41.900]  All right.
[2:13:41.900 --> 2:13:43.180]  Thank you so much for the call.
[2:13:43.180 --> 2:13:43.980]  Amazing call.
[2:13:44.700 --> 2:13:46.460]  I'm going to go to the order these are received.
[2:13:46.460 --> 2:13:52.540]  Let's go to Daniel in Toronto, Canada on the police state, Ukraine, COVID, everything.
[2:13:52.540 --> 2:13:53.500]  Daniel, thanks for holding.
[2:13:53.500 --> 2:13:53.900]  Go ahead.
[2:13:54.620 --> 2:13:55.340]  Hey, I was glad.
[2:13:55.340 --> 2:13:57.740]  Alex, did you want to stay your hero in mind, man?
[2:13:57.740 --> 2:14:00.060]  Since I was like 12 years old, been Washington so late.
[2:14:00.060 --> 2:14:01.020]  So it's a real honor to talk.
[2:14:01.020 --> 2:14:01.900]  You're a hero of mine.
[2:14:01.900 --> 2:14:03.340]  Everybody's standing up as a hero.
[2:14:03.340 --> 2:14:03.900]  God bless you.
[2:14:03.900 --> 2:14:04.620]  Thank you.
[2:14:04.620 --> 2:14:05.420]  Absolutely, man.
[2:14:05.420 --> 2:14:08.700]  So I've been in the entertainment industry for quite a long time up here in Canada.
[2:14:08.700 --> 2:14:13.020]  And I can tell you, man, I've been seeing this stuff come in, listening to your
[2:14:13.020 --> 2:14:14.460]  information, your documentaries.
[2:14:14.460 --> 2:14:17.740]  I've seen sort of the transgender ideology creeping up.
[2:14:17.740 --> 2:14:21.340]  Like I said, in the entertainment industry, I've worked on a few different shows up here
[2:14:21.340 --> 2:14:24.780]  in Canada, and I have just been watching it be pushed.
[2:14:24.780 --> 2:14:26.700]  I've been trying to talk to people about it.
[2:14:26.700 --> 2:14:29.420]  It's really hard, but you know, we all know how that goes.
[2:14:29.420 --> 2:14:33.260]  I actually have a question for you regarding Putin and what's going on with this whole
[2:14:33.260 --> 2:14:35.580]  crisis, and it kind of just popped in my mind.
[2:14:35.580 --> 2:14:40.540]  Is Putin another one of the graduate guys that went through the whole young leader
[2:14:40.540 --> 2:14:41.900]  thing with the world economic form?
[2:14:41.900 --> 2:14:48.620]  Yeah, well, Klaus Schwab got him to go to some of the conferences like Trump went.
[2:14:48.620 --> 2:14:51.340]  I don't think that means Trump's under Klaus Schwab's controller Putin.
[2:14:51.340 --> 2:14:53.500]  It doesn't mean Trump's perfect or Putin's perfect.
[2:14:53.500 --> 2:14:53.980]  I don't know.
[2:14:53.980 --> 2:14:56.220]  I mean, Schwab will exaggerate some.
[2:14:56.220 --> 2:14:57.660]  Most of these big conference guys do it.
[2:14:57.660 --> 2:15:00.460]  But with Schwab, it's actually the Bilderberg Group's public conference.
[2:15:00.460 --> 2:15:03.180]  So they do have incredible power.
[2:15:03.180 --> 2:15:04.620]  He's just tried to normalize it.
[2:15:04.620 --> 2:15:10.700]  So most of the time Schwab is not exaggerating, but the case of him saying he controls Putin,
[2:15:10.700 --> 2:15:12.140]  we've seen no evidence of that.
[2:15:12.140 --> 2:15:14.620]  But I know I've talked to some high level people.
[2:15:15.420 --> 2:15:21.660]  They say Putin's a triple agent, and by triple agent, they say he works with a bunch of
[2:15:21.660 --> 2:15:24.700]  deep state groups and the Russians and some other groups.
[2:15:25.340 --> 2:15:29.660]  But I mean, anybody that's a spy chief like that is interfacing with all the groups.
[2:15:29.660 --> 2:15:30.380]  Does that make sense?
[2:15:31.020 --> 2:15:31.820]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:15:31.820 --> 2:15:34.700]  Considering like the whole KGB path, it wouldn't be surprised.
[2:15:34.700 --> 2:15:38.220]  I mean, we definitely got some of the world economic form guys up here in Canada.
[2:15:38.220 --> 2:15:40.380]  Trudeau, Forsher, Deputy Prime Minister.
[2:15:40.380 --> 2:15:41.260]  Daniel, don't hang up.
[2:15:41.260 --> 2:15:45.580]  I got a special guest popping up for one segment from Eastern Ukraine.
[2:15:45.580 --> 2:15:50.860]  We're going to go back to you and then to Lisa, Sam, Chris, Donna, Elaine, Andrew,
[2:15:50.860 --> 2:15:52.060]  Clayton, we're getting to all of you.
[2:15:52.060 --> 2:15:52.620]  Stay with us.
[2:15:52.620 --> 2:16:01.740]  Sold out for months. X3 is now back in stock.
[2:16:01.740 --> 2:16:05.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing.
[2:16:05.900 --> 2:16:09.260]  And so many people are deficient in iodine.
[2:16:09.260 --> 2:16:10.540]  It's not the soil anymore.
[2:16:11.100 --> 2:16:13.100]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[2:16:13.100 --> 2:16:18.460]  But when you get high quality tri iodine, all three of the healthy types together,
[2:16:18.460 --> 2:16:21.900]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido.
[2:16:21.900 --> 2:16:23.740]  But most importantly, your immune system.
[2:16:23.740 --> 2:16:30.940]  So X3, the only tri iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again

[2:16:37.420 --> 2:16:41.900]  takes about two weeks to get on average, you really need to experience X3.
[2:16:41.900 --> 2:16:44.700]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.

[2:16:58.460 --> 2:16:59.820]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[2:16:59.820 --> 2:17:01.900]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[2:17:01.900 --> 2:17:02.220]  Welcome.
[2:17:02.220 --> 2:17:03.020]  Hello, Alex.
[2:17:03.020 --> 2:17:03.580]  Yes, Malcolm.
[2:17:03.580 --> 2:17:03.900]  All right.
[2:17:03.900 --> 2:17:08.060]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[2:17:08.060 --> 2:17:12.460]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer,
[2:17:12.460 --> 2:17:15.420]  super male volatility and brain force plus.
[2:17:15.420 --> 2:17:16.700]  Mix those two together.
[2:17:16.700 --> 2:17:18.300]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[2:17:18.300 --> 2:17:20.140]  Super male volatility really, really works.
[2:17:20.140 --> 2:17:25.020]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[2:17:25.020 --> 2:17:30.780]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well,
[2:17:30.780 --> 2:17:31.820]  but just aren't as strong.
[2:17:31.820 --> 2:17:33.580]  This is like a very fine wine.
[2:17:34.540 --> 2:17:35.820]  In fact, each batch is different.
[2:17:35.820 --> 2:17:37.020]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[2:17:37.020 --> 2:17:38.220]  Sometimes it's just okay.
[2:17:38.220 --> 2:17:41.500]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[2:17:41.500 --> 2:17:42.380]  That's just how it is.
[2:17:42.380 --> 2:17:43.180]  It's how it works.
[2:17:44.060 --> 2:17:45.660]  So it's always good.
[2:17:45.660 --> 2:17:47.820]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[2:17:47.820 --> 2:17:51.740]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[2:18:18.140 --> 2:18:22.940]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals
[2:18:22.940 --> 2:18:25.420]  that contain the rose plant seeds.
[2:18:25.420 --> 2:18:30.700]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[2:18:30.700 --> 2:18:36.060]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[2:18:36.060 --> 2:18:41.020]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role
[2:18:41.020 --> 2:18:45.100]  in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[2:18:45.100 --> 2:18:48.780]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate,
[2:18:48.780 --> 2:18:51.740]  even in affluent populations like here in America.
[2:18:51.740 --> 2:18:55.420]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at inforstore.com,
[2:18:55.420 --> 2:18:58.300]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[2:18:58.300 --> 2:18:59.820]  Mike in California, thanks for calling.
[2:18:59.820 --> 2:19:03.980]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research.
[2:19:03.980 --> 2:19:09.100]  Now, if you read the actual, you know, 2014 legislation, the U.S. government gain of function
[2:19:09.100 --> 2:19:14.540]  deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research
[2:19:14.540 --> 2:19:16.860]  involving influenza, MERS, and SARS viruses.
[2:19:16.860 --> 2:19:21.100]  There's nothing about SARS-like viruses, and it's a research funding pause.
[2:19:21.100 --> 2:19:21.980]  It's not a stop.
[2:19:21.980 --> 2:19:23.340]  It's not a prohibition.
[2:19:23.340 --> 2:19:26.220]  It's when you come to a four-way intersection, there's the stop sign.
[2:19:26.220 --> 2:19:28.700]  You stop, you look both ways, and then you proceed.
[2:19:28.700 --> 2:19:33.260]  And so it's also, it doesn't pause all gain of function, just selected gain of function.
[2:19:33.260 --> 2:19:37.820]  But they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research.
[2:19:37.820 --> 2:19:40.700]  So, you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right.
[2:19:40.700 --> 2:19:43.420]  They don't quite know what they're talking about, calling it gain of function.
[2:19:43.420 --> 2:19:45.180]  You know, that's why he didn't perjure himself.
[2:19:45.180 --> 2:19:46.700]  That's why he hasn't been arrested.
[2:19:46.700 --> 2:19:50.940]  Because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do.
[2:19:50.940 --> 2:19:54.060]  But in the main definition, it's still a gain of function.
[2:19:54.060 --> 2:19:56.620]  You're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[2:19:56.620 --> 2:19:57.420]  Thank you, Mike.
[2:19:57.420 --> 2:20:22.380]  We love you.
[2:20:22.380 --> 2:20:28.380]  Well, he joins us from Donetsk, one of the breakaway republics there in eastern Ukraine.
[2:20:28.380 --> 2:20:31.260]  Patrick Lancaster is a U.S. Navy veteran.
[2:20:31.900 --> 2:20:36.380]  For over eight years, he's been in Ukraine, and he's been covering the war for seven and a half.
[2:20:36.380 --> 2:20:40.780]  He's gotten some of the most incredible frontline battle footage of the 14,000-plus people killed,
[2:20:41.340 --> 2:20:46.140]  mainly with the proxy operatives attacking the Russian population.
[2:20:46.140 --> 2:20:47.020]  That's just a fact.
[2:20:48.140 --> 2:20:51.900]  And now we've got Putin saying he's invading to stop Nazis.
[2:20:51.900 --> 2:20:55.980]  Well, when you hear Donald Trump's a Nazi, or here I'm a Nazi, it's made up.
[2:20:55.980 --> 2:21:00.620]  But in the case of Ukraine, people don't know that even when Germany fell,
[2:21:00.620 --> 2:21:05.020]  Ukraine held out for six months with Nazis and stayed behind networks.
[2:21:05.020 --> 2:21:09.660]  And the Russians did come in heavy-handed, and Putin apologized five or six days ago for it,
[2:21:09.660 --> 2:21:14.860]  even though he didn't do it, because they did slaughter a bunch of people to kick the Nazis out.
[2:21:14.860 --> 2:21:17.180]  So, Patrick, you've been there in the middle of this.
[2:21:17.180 --> 2:21:19.500]  You were on right before this began.
[2:21:19.500 --> 2:21:20.860]  What precipitated it?
[2:21:20.860 --> 2:21:24.380]  What are you really seeing with your inside knowledge as an American living over there
[2:21:24.380 --> 2:21:25.020]  as a journalist?
[2:21:25.020 --> 2:21:26.300]  What's really going on?
[2:21:26.300 --> 2:21:28.780]  And thank you for joining us out there in that war zone.
[2:21:30.620 --> 2:21:31.260]  Hi, Alex.
[2:21:31.260 --> 2:21:32.300]  Thanks for having me.
[2:21:32.300 --> 2:21:33.260]  It's great to be back.
[2:21:33.980 --> 2:21:36.780]  Yeah, this has been one hell of a week here.
[2:21:37.580 --> 2:21:42.300]  I've been filming bodies in the streets almost every day.
[2:21:42.300 --> 2:21:45.100]  And there's many that I haven't been able to report on.
[2:21:45.100 --> 2:21:51.100]  After the last time we talked, things considerably changed.
[2:21:51.100 --> 2:21:57.900]  There was a change in the mood with the local population here, especially when just a few days ago,
[2:21:57.900 --> 2:22:05.340]  Russia decided to officially recognize the republics, the breakaway republics of the
[2:22:05.340 --> 2:22:08.940]  Donetsk and up to the north, the Lugansk People's Republic.
[2:22:08.940 --> 2:22:17.180]  And the people were here in this square celebrating, not a lot because of this act of war and
[2:22:17.180 --> 2:22:24.300]  escalation going on, but people came out, huge fireworks show here, and just people crying
[2:22:24.300 --> 2:22:28.940]  out of happiness that Russia has stepped up and recognized the republics.
[2:22:28.940 --> 2:22:32.460]  It's something they've been waiting on for almost eight years now.
[2:22:32.460 --> 2:22:37.420]  And the people thought that that would bring an end to this war.
[2:22:37.420 --> 2:22:38.780]  That was their hope.
[2:22:38.780 --> 2:22:44.940]  And this morning, well, earlier in the week, I should say,
[2:22:45.660 --> 2:22:52.220]  there were two schools hit directly in the courtyards by Ukrainian shelling.
[2:22:52.220 --> 2:22:53.260]  I was at those schools.
[2:22:53.260 --> 2:22:56.940]  I brought those reports to the English speaking population,
[2:22:56.940 --> 2:22:58.860]  because there's no Western mainstream media here.
[2:22:58.860 --> 2:23:00.620]  It's just me doing English reports here.
[2:23:02.620 --> 2:23:06.940]  From near one of those schools, I filmed a man who,
[2:23:06.940 --> 2:23:12.140]  in the morning, he was walking to his job to take a bus.
[2:23:12.140 --> 2:23:15.020]  He would walk to a bus station to take a bus waiting on the bus.
[2:23:15.020 --> 2:23:15.900]  He was a miner.
[2:23:16.460 --> 2:23:17.820]  And I said, I filmed him.
[2:23:17.820 --> 2:23:19.420]  Well, I filmed half of him.
[2:23:19.420 --> 2:23:25.740]  The only thing that was left was his legs, because his body was half completely obliterated
[2:23:25.740 --> 2:23:28.460]  by a Ukrainian shell that was launched on his neighborhood,
[2:23:29.500 --> 2:23:32.460]  just about 400 meters from the school that was hit.
[2:23:32.460 --> 2:23:38.060]  At the same day, I went to another area of Donetsk where there was another school hit.
[2:23:38.060 --> 2:23:47.900]  There were just yesterday, there was a local TV station here in Donetsk,
[2:23:47.900 --> 2:23:52.460]  the media center where the big antennas that give the TV for Donetsk.
[2:23:52.460 --> 2:23:56.460]  There was an IED put outside the fence line.
[2:23:56.460 --> 2:23:57.980]  And let me raise that point.
[2:23:57.980 --> 2:23:59.820]  As you know, three weeks ago, two weeks ago,
[2:23:59.820 --> 2:24:02.140]  they even attacked me at the State Department saying,
[2:24:02.140 --> 2:24:03.740]  oh, that's Alex Jones stuff.
[2:24:03.740 --> 2:24:05.500]  They're saying those were false flags.
[2:24:06.140 --> 2:24:08.220]  Obviously, there's no evidence of that either way.
[2:24:08.220 --> 2:24:09.340]  How do we prove it was Russia?
[2:24:09.340 --> 2:24:10.620]  How do we prove it was NATO?
[2:24:11.180 --> 2:24:13.180]  I mean, I'm putting you on the spot.
[2:24:13.180 --> 2:24:15.820]  I'm just asking, how do we know who's attacking who?
[2:24:17.740 --> 2:24:23.100]  Well, with the school in particular that was near the man who was killed,
[2:24:23.100 --> 2:24:27.820]  I stood there again, showed my reports, and all could be seen on the maps.
[2:24:27.820 --> 2:24:33.740]  The two impacts literally happened on the side of the school that's facing Ukraine-controlled
[2:24:33.740 --> 2:24:34.620]  territory.
[2:24:34.620 --> 2:24:40.940]  For the explosion to have been shot from the direction of the main area of the anti-government
[2:24:40.940 --> 2:24:45.580]  into Ukraine-government territory, the shell would have had to have been a ghost shell
[2:24:46.220 --> 2:24:48.460]  and gone through the school before it exploded.
[2:24:48.460 --> 2:24:48.700]  I understand.
[2:24:48.700 --> 2:24:52.060]  So, I mean, obviously, it's not debated that Ukraine's been attacking that area
[2:24:52.060 --> 2:24:52.940]  for seven and a half years.
[2:24:52.940 --> 2:24:54.620]  So, you're saying it's a continuation of that.
[2:24:54.620 --> 2:24:57.420]  Well, I see this footage we've been showing.
[2:24:57.420 --> 2:25:03.900]  Is this the Ukrainian-Russian ethnic groups conscripting, signing up to be in the military?
[2:25:05.740 --> 2:25:07.740]  This footage right here we're looking at.
[2:25:07.740 --> 2:25:12.060]  This is just a few hours ago today.
[2:25:12.060 --> 2:25:17.260]  I was at a location where there was a, it's called a mobilization center,
[2:25:17.260 --> 2:25:19.900]  a draft center, a recruiting center, whatever you want to call it.
[2:25:19.900 --> 2:25:23.180]  But these people on the screen right here, these are the deputies,
[2:25:23.180 --> 2:25:30.380]  the lawmakers of the republic who has been, the ones who have been running this republic
[2:25:31.180 --> 2:25:33.340]  is for the last almost eight years now.
[2:25:34.300 --> 2:25:35.580]  It's not just those few.
[2:25:35.580 --> 2:25:40.460]  There was a whole big group of all the deputies from the dead yet people from the public.
[2:25:40.460 --> 2:25:40.700]  Sure.
[2:25:40.700 --> 2:25:44.620]  So, the earlier footage I showed is people lining up to sign up for the military.
[2:25:46.380 --> 2:25:46.700]  Yes.
[2:25:46.700 --> 2:25:52.860]  This is the deputies, the leaders of the republic to join the army.
[2:25:52.860 --> 2:25:55.660]  And they're already off to the front.
[2:25:56.780 --> 2:25:57.020]  Wow.
[2:25:57.020 --> 2:25:58.540]  So, what do you expect Ukraine to do?
[2:25:58.540 --> 2:26:05.340]  I know Putin has given Ukraine an opportunity to capitulate and to surrender.
[2:26:05.340 --> 2:26:07.100]  He says he won't make it a puppet statement.
[2:26:07.100 --> 2:26:09.180]  He doesn't want Western weapons in there.
[2:26:09.180 --> 2:26:10.780]  He wants to be a demilitarized zone.
[2:26:10.780 --> 2:26:12.060]  What do you make of those statements?
[2:26:14.700 --> 2:26:20.540]  Honestly, when I woke up this morning and saw what had begun in the nights,
[2:26:20.540 --> 2:26:22.700]  I was very shocked.
[2:26:22.700 --> 2:26:27.900]  I didn't think this was really going to go past the original borders of the republics.
[2:26:28.460 --> 2:26:35.340]  But with the attacks on the civilian population here over the last eight, almost eight years,
[2:26:35.900 --> 2:26:37.500]  it seemed Putin had enough.
[2:26:37.500 --> 2:26:42.300]  And like you said, the denatification, because that's a fact.
[2:26:42.300 --> 2:26:44.620]  It's not even just after World War II.
[2:26:44.620 --> 2:26:50.060]  Now, in the ranks of the Ukrainian military, there are Nazi people
[2:26:50.060 --> 2:26:52.940]  that fully believe in the Nazi ideology.
[2:26:52.940 --> 2:26:55.020]  You're talking about the Azov battalion, right?
[2:26:55.020 --> 2:26:56.140]  The Azov battalion?
[2:26:57.740 --> 2:26:59.020]  Among others, yes.
[2:27:00.140 --> 2:27:02.860]  We also saw the report that they're registering Jews.
[2:27:02.860 --> 2:27:03.580]  A, is that true?
[2:27:03.580 --> 2:27:05.900]  And B, is that so they'll be protected?
[2:27:06.780 --> 2:27:07.740]  Is there any truth to that?
[2:27:09.340 --> 2:27:11.100]  That, I can't comment on.
[2:27:11.100 --> 2:27:11.820]  I'm not over there.
[2:27:11.820 --> 2:27:14.140]  I'm not involved in that story.
[2:27:15.660 --> 2:27:17.420]  But let me ask you this.
[2:27:17.420 --> 2:27:19.260]  What do you make of the situation?
[2:27:19.260 --> 2:27:25.020]  With like thousands of tanks and helicopters going in to the main country?
[2:27:25.020 --> 2:27:27.020]  I mean, this looks like a full-scale invasion.
[2:27:29.820 --> 2:27:36.140]  Yeah, I mean, it looks like Ukraine doesn't have much time left.
[2:27:37.340 --> 2:27:39.820]  I mean, cities are falling by the hour.
[2:27:40.380 --> 2:27:44.780]  So much territory has been lost by Ukraine since this morning.
[2:27:44.780 --> 2:27:50.300]  And all day, we've been here rumbling from the shelling and explosions.
[2:27:52.060 --> 2:27:54.540]  And it's hard to say at this point, what's incoming and what...
[2:27:57.580 --> 2:27:58.140]  Stay there.
[2:27:58.140 --> 2:28:01.980]  Your Skype connection does cut out if you can't come right back,
[2:28:01.980 --> 2:28:03.500]  because I want to talk about this.
[2:28:04.060 --> 2:28:08.220]  And again, for listeners tuning in, those helicopters, those Russian helicopters
[2:28:08.220 --> 2:28:10.460]  you see are not firing weapons right there.
[2:28:10.460 --> 2:28:14.860]  They're firing flares in case any aircraft missiles are fired at them.
[2:28:14.860 --> 2:28:17.100]  That's to stop heat-seeking missiles.
[2:28:17.100 --> 2:28:18.220]  See if we can reconnect with him.
[2:28:18.220 --> 2:28:20.700]  We'll finish up with him and then we'll go to Daniel.
[2:28:21.340 --> 2:28:24.700]  And everybody else that is patiently holding here with us today.
[2:28:24.700 --> 2:28:27.180]  What a broadcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:28:27.820 --> 2:28:28.780]  Yeah, yeah, stay there.
[2:28:28.780 --> 2:28:31.420]  Patrick, we just got your Skype back or whatever we're using.

[2:31:05.100 --> 2:31:07.820]  it's going to be hard to attain.
[2:31:07.820 --> 2:31:11.180]  And when it comes to information, boy, is that true today.
[2:31:11.180 --> 2:31:16.140]  We see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation,
[2:31:16.140 --> 2:31:19.740]  great reset combine, trying to collapse our society
[2:31:19.740 --> 2:31:24.140]  to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision,
[2:31:24.140 --> 2:31:28.140]  suppressing the voices of good people all around the world
[2:31:28.140 --> 2:31:31.340]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[2:31:31.340 --> 2:31:34.700]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria,

[2:32:01.980 --> 2:32:03.420]  I mean, this is from, people say,
[2:32:03.420 --> 2:32:06.540]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[2:32:06.540 --> 2:32:08.780]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world
[2:32:08.780 --> 2:32:12.540]  that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil,
[2:32:12.540 --> 2:32:13.900]  better than Guatemalan coffee.
[2:32:13.900 --> 2:32:17.420]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[2:32:17.420 --> 2:32:18.620]  but really they're just a commune.
[2:32:18.620 --> 2:32:21.660]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[2:32:21.660 --> 2:32:23.900]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[2:32:23.900 --> 2:32:25.660]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[2:32:25.660 --> 2:32:28.300]  and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[2:32:28.300 --> 2:32:32.540]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[2:32:32.540 --> 2:32:35.100]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere.
[2:32:35.100 --> 2:32:38.700]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[2:32:38.700 --> 2:32:44.860]  Um, in fact, I'm not gonna tell you a little story. Um, yeah, I'd like to.
[2:32:44.860 --> 2:32:46.620]  I'm sure you wouldn't believe it.
[2:32:46.620 --> 2:32:51.180]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[2:32:51.180 --> 2:33:09.180]  And if you can animate out, find us. You don't want to say that's fine leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:21.740 --> 2:33:26.940]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:30.540 --> 2:33:32.860]  All right, I'll be gone here in a few minutes. We really appreciate its time.
[2:33:32.860 --> 2:33:36.700]  He's on the middle of the night in a war zone, Patrick Lancaster.
[2:33:36.700 --> 2:33:40.300]  He was an independent American veteran living over there through the whole war.
[2:33:41.660 --> 2:33:44.140]  We're gonna go to your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[2:33:44.140 --> 2:33:46.620]  And I wanted to ask you about where you think this is going.
[2:33:46.620 --> 2:33:55.900]  What you think the West is going to do? I'm really worried the globalists are going to launch cyber attacks blaming on Russia because I know they've been really pre-programming that's coming.
[2:33:55.900 --> 2:34:01.100]  But first off, you are independent journalists, the life-risking things you do.
[2:34:01.100 --> 2:34:04.060]  I know you've got a Patreon. How do people support you if they want to?
[2:34:04.060 --> 2:34:18.060]  Yeah, thanks, Alex. People can find me on Patreon, which is on the screen there, Patrick Lancaster News Today, PL News Today, same as on Twitter.
[2:34:18.060 --> 2:34:27.660]  And yeah, I'm totally crowdfunded. I used to work with other Western mainstream agencies like Associated Press, Reuters, and many others.
[2:34:27.660 --> 2:34:33.260]  No, I remember you used to see you on national TV. Yeah, that's how I already knew you were. And then I saw your independent stuff.
[2:34:33.260 --> 2:34:35.500]  So what, would you shoot incredible stuff they would narrate?
[2:34:36.940 --> 2:34:47.100]  Well, actually, they would change the narrative. At one point, I shot a video where there was shelling of a soup kitchen in the Lugansk Republic.
[2:34:47.100 --> 2:34:56.940]  And many outlets, it came out and said that it was the Lugansk rebels that fired on the soup kitchen when it, in reality, it was Ukraine.
[2:34:56.940 --> 2:35:03.580]  And I filmed the witnesses, I filmed it all, and I was there, and I reported it all, and they just cut and changed what they wanted.
[2:35:03.580 --> 2:35:08.300]  So after that, I decided I wasn't going to work. Exactly. They don't just not report it. They flip it and say the opposite.
[2:35:09.820 --> 2:35:15.020]  Yep. All right. I've been asking questions here. I know it's dangerous out there in this war zone.
[2:35:15.020 --> 2:35:19.420]  The explosion's going off around there. I could ask a lot of questions, but you're the expert.
[2:35:19.420 --> 2:35:24.300]  What else do you want to get across to people? Give us your boil down on what's happening right now in this historic moment.
[2:35:24.300 --> 2:35:33.740]  Well, the main thing that throughout this war, the West has been pushing is that Russia has been the occupiers of this area,
[2:35:33.740 --> 2:35:40.620]  forcing Ukrainians to bend to their will and all the same as the West said about Crimea.
[2:35:40.620 --> 2:35:48.460]  When the fact is, it's ethically, ethnic Russians that live here in this territory, they speak Russian down in Crimea the same.
[2:35:48.460 --> 2:35:57.580]  And these people, when, might not happen, when their president Yanukovych was removed from office in 2014,
[2:35:57.580 --> 2:36:01.260]  they felt like their Ukraine was already dead, and they wanted to break away.
[2:36:01.260 --> 2:36:08.380]  And they democratically voted in a referendum in 2014 to break away. It wasn't an occupation.
[2:36:08.380 --> 2:36:13.660]  It was a people wanting to say what they wanted with their own land and their own families.
[2:36:13.660 --> 2:36:20.220]  And that's why I've been trying my best to show exactly what's been happening here over the last eight years.
[2:36:20.220 --> 2:36:26.140]  And basically, Ukraine's been punishing them for it. And I just keep on trying.
[2:36:26.140 --> 2:36:32.620]  And hopefully, soon the world will understand what has been happening here and what is happening here.
[2:36:32.620 --> 2:36:35.580]  Well, I just see a trap and a lot of the smart folks do.
[2:36:35.580 --> 2:36:41.260]  Why did Biden say, go ahead and invade. We won't do anything because they wouldn't do that because Trump might have done something.
[2:36:41.260 --> 2:36:45.980]  And I get Russia has its issues and its beefs. But I just sense a trap here.
[2:36:45.980 --> 2:36:51.020]  I really, I want peace and understand that it's the Slavic area, the birthplace of Russia.
[2:36:51.020 --> 2:36:53.660]  I get all the arguments. I get NATO brought weapons in.
[2:36:53.660 --> 2:36:58.300]  I just think we play four or five moves ahead here, Patrick Lancaster.
[2:36:58.300 --> 2:36:59.980]  I think something bad's about to happen.
[2:37:02.860 --> 2:37:07.980]  Yeah, it's a point where this could really boil over into a,
[2:37:07.980 --> 2:37:14.540]  I mean, I hate to say it, but something along the lines of World War Three.
[2:37:14.540 --> 2:37:20.460]  Because this is unprecedented. Just every month, every week, we just, every year,
[2:37:20.460 --> 2:37:24.700]  we just keep having more unprecedented events happen like this.
[2:37:24.700 --> 2:37:30.460]  I mean, I'm still, like I said, still in shock waking up this morning and seeing what's happening.
[2:37:30.460 --> 2:37:35.020]  The people here on the ground in Donetsk and Lugans are in tears of happiness.
[2:37:35.020 --> 2:37:40.060]  One woman told me that she's, that she's so thankful that Putin is going to stop the war
[2:37:40.060 --> 2:37:42.620]  here and she could finally feel like a real person again.
[2:37:43.900 --> 2:37:45.900]  Wow. Thank you so much for the time.
[2:37:47.020 --> 2:37:49.420]  Closing comments. What else do you want to tell people?
[2:37:51.260 --> 2:37:57.180]  Just do your own research, try to watch your videos or reports from every side of the contact
[2:37:57.180 --> 2:38:02.060]  line as possible. I'm here in Donetsk and the anti-Ukraine side.
[2:38:02.060 --> 2:38:06.460]  There's journalists on the other side. Watch both sides. Think for yourself.
[2:38:06.460 --> 2:38:09.900]  Don't listen to the narrative the Western mainstream media gives you.
[2:38:10.860 --> 2:38:17.740]  Research and find out the facts. And you can find my reports on YouTube, Patrick Lancaster,
[2:38:17.740 --> 2:38:20.700]  Patrick Lancaster News Today, and on Patreon.
[2:38:21.500 --> 2:38:25.660]  And let me expand on that before you go because I'm a servant of the truth.
[2:38:25.660 --> 2:38:29.180]  And when I see Putin come out and say the media makes fun of him,
[2:38:29.180 --> 2:38:35.660]  that he's fighting Nazis. I mean, they call everybody Nazis.
[2:38:35.660 --> 2:38:40.060]  But in this case, I see major rallies with the major opposition,
[2:38:40.060 --> 2:38:45.500]  Hiling Hitler. And if there's really a big group of Nazis involved, it is in the Ukraine.
[2:38:46.060 --> 2:38:49.820]  So everybody overuses the Nazi thing to where it becomes like a joke.
[2:38:50.780 --> 2:38:56.540]  But I don't think people understand that probably what half the opposition group are Nazis.
[2:38:56.540 --> 2:39:01.420]  I mean, when they first had the coup eight years ago, it was the Nazi party that was in control.
[2:39:01.420 --> 2:39:05.900]  I mean, they actually have swastikas at their events. They're not joking.
[2:39:09.580 --> 2:39:13.980]  What do you say to that in closing, Patrick? Yeah, it's a fact.
[2:39:13.980 --> 2:39:20.540]  I mean, I was shocked when I came here eight years ago and saw that there really is still
[2:39:20.540 --> 2:39:27.660]  Nazis, not only in the civilian population, but the military, the paramilitary that are fighting
[2:39:27.660 --> 2:39:33.420]  this war. I mean, they even put the emblems on their helmets and things. And this isn't just,
[2:39:33.420 --> 2:39:38.860]  you know, this side saying that the BBC did a report on this as well. I mean, this is a fact.
[2:39:39.900 --> 2:39:46.540]  So again, if I was in line with Nazis, a 75 year old dead party, I'd be in trouble and I'm not
[2:39:46.540 --> 2:39:51.100]  in line with them. If you were, you would be. How does Biden in the left always be involved with
[2:39:51.100 --> 2:39:59.340]  them, whether it's Soros or whether it is Schwarzenegger, he told Rolling Stone, he was a Nazi
[2:39:59.340 --> 2:40:03.100]  in an interview. And people said he won't. I mean, the point was Dab was an SS officer.
[2:40:03.100 --> 2:40:07.500]  I'm just saying I'm not connected to Nazis. I'm sick of being called one. And these people are
[2:40:07.500 --> 2:40:20.940]  as thick as thieves with Nazis. Yeah, I mean, I don't really know. I mean, this whole Nazi phenomenon
[2:40:20.940 --> 2:40:28.380]  in Ukraine is just something that seems like Putin is going to put it into now. We can say that much.
[2:40:29.100 --> 2:40:31.980]  Well, there's no doubt in closing. We'll come back and take calls, folks. Be patient.
[2:40:33.340 --> 2:40:37.100]  It looks like Putin's fully committed now. I mean, this is a full on invasion. I guess he
[2:40:37.100 --> 2:40:41.100]  told him, don't join NATO. I won't invade. Then they would then I'm going to take these back.
[2:40:41.100 --> 2:40:45.660]  Don't attack the areas. Once he took control of those Russian areas, the historically part of
[2:40:45.660 --> 2:40:50.700]  Russia, then those got attacked. So I guess he just keeps escalating. And they keep escalating back.
[2:40:50.700 --> 2:40:56.700]  Now he said, you will have a historic response, the likes of which you've never seen, if you move
[2:40:56.700 --> 2:41:06.300]  against us to the West. That sounds like a nuclear weapons threat. You got any comments on that,
[2:41:06.300 --> 2:41:15.820]  Patrick? I mean, the threats that have been going back and forth between the West and the East,
[2:41:15.820 --> 2:41:25.500]  I mean, it's just hard to say what's going to happen in the near future if there isn't some
[2:41:25.500 --> 2:41:32.940]  sort of agreement and neutral zone put here in the middle. That's kind of how it seemed
[2:41:32.940 --> 2:41:38.620]  that the republics were acting as. But now it might be all of Ukraine. So we'll have to see
[2:41:38.620 --> 2:41:44.700]  what Ukraine is after the next couple of weeks. Absolutely. Well, things have definitely escalated
[2:41:44.700 --> 2:41:49.980]  the next level. Thank you so much for being with us. We'll talk to you soon. Patrick Lancaster.
[2:41:49.980 --> 2:41:57.740]  All right, I promise I'm going to get to every caller, Daniel and then Chris and then Andrew

[2:42:15.260 --> 2:42:21.180]  for that. And we will be looking for it. Paul Watson is going to host the fourth hour today.

[2:44:00.700 --> 2:44:07.340]  kava kava root supplement that is now available at infowarstore.com. Kava is one of the hottest
[2:44:07.340 --> 2:44:11.980]  new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of
[2:44:11.980 --> 2:44:17.900]  years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan
[2:44:17.900 --> 2:44:24.060]  legend, kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme
[2:44:24.060 --> 2:44:29.820]  ruler and creator of the universe. The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings
[2:44:29.820 --> 2:44:35.260]  and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little. Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many
[2:44:35.260 --> 2:44:41.580]  who enjoy its serious benefits. The new kava chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of
[2:44:41.580 --> 2:44:48.140]  not only kava kava but other herbs including but not limited to German kama milk, organic skull
[2:44:48.140 --> 2:44:53.900]  cap and balearion root. We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure

[2:45:57.580 --> 2:46:05.260]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[2:46:05.260 --> 2:46:12.060]  until the populations rebelled. They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law
[2:46:12.060 --> 2:46:18.140]  and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives but because of so many
[2:46:18.140 --> 2:46:24.060]  scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers now
[2:46:24.060 --> 2:46:30.540]  their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government
[2:46:30.540 --> 2:46:36.380]  corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever. The problem is some
[2:46:36.380 --> 2:46:42.380]  globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover like Canada with it now declared
[2:46:42.380 --> 2:46:47.900]  a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world are following suit
[2:46:47.900 --> 2:46:53.340]  like Australia so pray for these folks big time it's a very serious situation and stay tuned
[2:46:53.340 --> 2:47:01.580]  into info wars.com because truth is absolutely paramount. Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[2:47:01.580 --> 2:47:15.180]  of the new world order it's alex jones. Let's go right back to your phone calls here. Daniel in
[2:47:15.180 --> 2:47:22.780]  Toronto Canada. Wow. Ultrado pulled his horns in pulled back that emergency declaration. It was
[2:47:22.780 --> 2:47:27.500]  backfiring on him but as long as you remember what he did and he's holding much political prisoners
[2:47:27.500 --> 2:47:33.420]  he will fall not us it's the long game that wins. Daniel what else you want to say from Canada.
[2:47:34.300 --> 2:47:39.820]  Hey man I just wanted to touch on that again I guess yeah Trudeau man he is uh he is something
[2:47:39.820 --> 2:47:44.700]  else isn't he he just he was just talking about authoritarianism and we have to connect protect
[2:47:44.700 --> 2:47:49.820]  Ukrainians and democracy overseas while he literally cracks down and you know conducts
[2:47:49.820 --> 2:47:54.380]  martial law and beats veterans in the streets it's just absolutely ridiculous and it's like
[2:47:54.380 --> 2:48:00.300]  you know here we are man wars rumors of war we're watching absolutely biblical things going on but
[2:48:00.300 --> 2:48:06.140]  I think uh I think considering everything going on man from the backs passes crackdowns peaceful
[2:48:06.140 --> 2:48:11.500]  protest it's it's like total sensory overload at this point you know what I mean and oh I agree I
[2:48:11.500 --> 2:48:16.460]  never even got to the giant covid news today where they mainline universities say it's a hundred percent
[2:48:16.460 --> 2:48:22.700]  man made not even virus is mixed it's all man made it's a synthetic totally lab made
[2:48:22.700 --> 2:48:28.060]  none of it came even out of nature yep yep and uh none of us up here have got the vaccine in my
[2:48:28.060 --> 2:48:32.060]  family like we're staying away from that we knew that from the get go and that's from information
[2:48:32.060 --> 2:48:37.340]  that you uh graciously shared with us so you know it's more important than ever I think to have like
[2:48:37.340 --> 2:48:41.420]  a real serious moral grounding and that's what I agree brother you say graciously if I don't get out
[2:48:41.420 --> 2:48:44.780]  of this you don't get out of it if you don't get out of it I don't get out of we're in this together
[2:48:45.660 --> 2:48:50.540]  it's absolutely right man and in my opinion you know let God be true and every man be a liar
[2:48:50.540 --> 2:48:54.220]  it's it's hard to rely on the vast majority information right now like I heard you talking
[2:48:54.220 --> 2:48:59.980]  there to uh Patrick in Ukraine it's really hard to uh to figure out exactly what's happening on
[2:48:59.980 --> 2:49:04.220]  the ground and I think that's why people love you show so much Alex is because you're parsing
[2:49:04.220 --> 2:49:09.900]  through it live with us you know right along no exactly I don't claim to have all the answers I mean
[2:49:09.900 --> 2:49:14.300]  on stuff that's established I did but I'm not like like so I don't get some talking point like
[2:49:14.300 --> 2:49:19.100]  say Putin's bad or say Putin's good God bless your brother thanks for the call Daniel all right
[2:49:19.100 --> 2:49:25.500]  who's been holding the longest now that would be Clayton Clayton in Canada Clayton welcome
[2:49:26.220 --> 2:49:31.260]  hey how are you man I'm pretty freaked out quite frankly I think I might I went to bed last night
[2:49:31.260 --> 2:49:36.700]  about 10 o'clock woke up at 3 a.m. and it was already Warren Warren Ukraine yeah I kind of
[2:49:36.700 --> 2:49:41.900]  feel like just the right piece of information just might make you explode right yes sir what's going on
[2:49:43.020 --> 2:49:46.380]  well there's a bit of a flip-flop overnight and I haven't been able to confirm it but
[2:49:46.380 --> 2:49:54.380]  um when Trudeau revoked the emergency act while the senate was about to strike it down apparently
[2:49:55.900 --> 2:50:00.860]  I believe it was rebel news put out a story that he's going back on it again saying that he wants
[2:50:00.860 --> 2:50:06.460]  more federal powers outside of the emergency act oh yeah I've got that's confirmed so first he's
[2:50:06.460 --> 2:50:10.940]  never gonna expand it then he wants it permanent now he doesn't want it permanent but he wants
[2:50:10.940 --> 2:50:17.420]  censorship powers selectively when he wants so he wants martial law selectively which is even worse
[2:50:17.420 --> 2:50:23.580]  than full martial law but I think there is actually a purpose behind it and it it it kind of falls on
[2:50:23.580 --> 2:50:29.500]  the shoulder well the left and the right shoulder of China and Russia if they are in cahoots and
[2:50:29.500 --> 2:50:37.180]  they don't actually like um like double cross one another um that would that would basically
[2:50:37.180 --> 2:50:45.180]  be bad for Canada because you're probably aware that like Iceland um uh like northern Canada and
[2:50:45.180 --> 2:50:51.740]  Alaska aren't very well defended um and I don't know like what angle to go with it but there is
[2:50:51.740 --> 2:50:56.460]  equipment up there that they could use if they got a hold of it I don't want to give anybody ideas but
[2:50:57.020 --> 2:51:02.620]  or you know do the conspiracy theorist thing but I mean harp is an actual technology and it is
[2:51:02.620 --> 2:51:07.500]  located in Alaska at least one of them is but the russians already that's even in the news the russians
[2:51:07.500 --> 2:51:12.620]  have it too but you have to be in the location where the equipment is to affect change I mean you
[2:51:12.620 --> 2:51:16.380]  could probably push things around on the other side of the planet but it's not going to be as
[2:51:16.940 --> 2:51:21.900]  um effective or predictable now you're right capturing the weather weapons would be key so
[2:51:21.900 --> 2:51:28.940]  what are you saying um I'm saying that you know in in chests when you have the whole back line
[2:51:28.940 --> 2:51:33.820]  emptied and you can kind of flip the rook and the king yeah I think that's what they're doing
[2:51:33.820 --> 2:51:40.140]  right now but it's going to be russia to china they're they're basically gonna you know they've
[2:51:40.140 --> 2:51:46.380]  already got momentum and if they decide well north america's weak look what our leader's doing look
[2:51:46.380 --> 2:51:53.100]  what biden's doing um well the left so programmed to attack anything called hitler if they said we're
[2:51:53.100 --> 2:51:57.100]  gonna blow america up and fight hitler the average leftist would walk outside and blow their head
[2:51:57.100 --> 2:52:02.300]  off they'd say i'm hitler put inside i'm hitler i mean i hear you i appreciate your call
[2:52:05.900 --> 2:52:10.220]  this country's committing suicide right in front of us uh let's take another call here
[2:52:10.220 --> 2:52:16.220]  who has been holding the longest that would be andrew in texas than lisa andrew welcome
[2:52:17.260 --> 2:52:23.740]  hey alex long time list nurse second time caller welcome brother real quick real quick happy belated
[2:52:23.740 --> 2:52:28.620]  birthday brother thank you sir happy belated and just want to just give real quick plug man
[2:52:28.620 --> 2:52:35.420]  uh krill oil and down and out amazing product amazing product great okay so here's the deal
[2:52:35.420 --> 2:52:45.340]  if the market does crash aren't there uh circuit breakers to prevent the market to crash then
[2:52:45.340 --> 2:52:49.820]  yes the globalists have the plunge protection team the president's group and open markets
[2:52:49.820 --> 2:52:54.620]  the russians already put their yes they have systems if it crashes it's because the system
[2:52:54.620 --> 2:53:04.140]  let it crash okay so this would probably be why uh hr 83 36 never never went never made it through
[2:53:05.180 --> 2:53:10.380]  trying to take the powers from the president to try to kill the internet which would probably be
[2:53:10.380 --> 2:53:15.420]  in combination with the market crash am i right am i wrong i think you're i think you're absolutely
[2:53:15.420 --> 2:53:20.940]  right everything is about how to crash the market and convince the public to go along with it to
[2:53:20.940 --> 2:53:26.540]  bring in the new global currency what what should somebody do this low level now doesn't have a
[2:53:26.540 --> 2:53:31.420]  lot of cash maybe some savings here what would i'm the same as you man i mean it's a good it's
[2:53:31.420 --> 2:53:36.460]  kind of a freeing feeling i haven't a lot of extra money but it's also kind of scary um nothing is
[2:53:36.460 --> 2:53:41.660]  safe now other than friends and family you can trust and some basic food water and guns to protect
[2:53:41.660 --> 2:53:46.380]  yourself the most valuable thing now is family that knows what's going on and our friends will
[2:53:46.380 --> 2:53:50.140]  stick together brother i think that's the most important and of course above all that's a relationship
[2:53:50.140 --> 2:53:56.540]  with god god hey brother fasting and prayer does miracles hey i want to just just say everybody
[2:53:56.540 --> 2:54:01.980]  have hope trust jesus and stay close to family god bless you alex love you man thank you andrea
[2:54:01.980 --> 2:54:06.780]  andrew asked me the question he already does it it's god and family and then in the country but
[2:54:06.780 --> 2:54:13.740]  the country's i mean this this bad folks but this way it is it's way it is we killed 60 million
[2:54:13.740 --> 2:54:17.580]  babies in this country and we're gonna get hurt real bad for it you don't get away with stuff
[2:54:17.580 --> 2:54:24.300]  like that folks you don't you don't get away with it you get hurt real bad for it let's go
[2:54:24.300 --> 2:54:28.860]  ahead and take another call here jam another one in uh who's holding the longest here let's say
[2:54:29.820 --> 2:54:33.660]  lisa's next but donna's been holding the longest donna in texas donna go ahead
[2:54:33.660 --> 2:54:40.940]  hi alex donna here how are you i'm pretty it's all while we're living in the middle of it aren't
[2:54:40.940 --> 2:54:48.540]  we it is it is and i honestly alex when i watched your show yesterday i have been chomping at the
[2:54:48.540 --> 2:54:56.380]  bit for actually so long to share two practical skills because i want to encourage you know just
[2:54:56.380 --> 2:55:00.460]  everybody well donna you're awesome and you got you got two and a half minutes tell us about it
[2:55:00.460 --> 2:55:07.980]  okay yes okay so warfare going on right in the physical ukraine bio medical people fighting
[2:55:07.980 --> 2:55:14.940]  wars everywhere we know it's spiritual warfare and what i want to share is that this year the year
[2:55:14.940 --> 2:55:26.300]  22 2022 so it's year 22 22 in the hebu alphabet means completion it means fulfillment the last
[2:55:26.300 --> 2:55:35.900]  chapter of the bible is revelations 22 fulfillment in christ fulfillment in christ and so when we
[2:55:35.900 --> 2:55:43.180]  surrender to the christ essence it's not just a religious i'm not talking about religion
[2:55:43.180 --> 2:55:49.100]  i've been a spiritual teacher and i teach quantum physics of consciousness so i go deeper into the
[2:55:49.100 --> 2:55:53.900]  quantum physics of saying and well you also know the return of pluto whether we believe it or not
[2:55:53.900 --> 2:56:00.060]  also matches up with the bible and with the Torah and the rest of it of this year and this the last
[2:56:00.060 --> 2:56:08.220]  time this happened was on on tuesday 17 76 July 4th so you can ignore it but the globalists
[2:56:08.220 --> 2:56:14.140]  believe in it and it's definitely happening it is and i love what you just said because 22 the
[2:56:14.140 --> 2:56:21.260]  globalists call it the great reset it's the greatest reset the greatest reset is christ so
[2:56:21.260 --> 2:56:28.620]  the last chapter of 22 is a revelation but the revolution is our greatest reset which is christ
[2:56:28.620 --> 2:56:33.580]  so i'm going to share with you a practical skill okay and this has to do with covet and this
[2:56:36.060 --> 2:56:41.980]  oh because i'm like how can people don't know this that you know because your show alex is called
[2:56:41.980 --> 2:56:50.540]  info wars the war is on our mind the elite know they know what mass consciousness does it
[2:56:50.540 --> 2:56:57.180]  they know that every word has a frequency every letter every number has a frequency
[2:56:57.180 --> 2:57:06.060]  that either kills life or gives life the word covet now get that the word covet 19 or coronavirus
[2:57:06.060 --> 2:57:12.380]  when you even see it think it speak it it kills life force and cuts off the connection to our
[2:57:12.380 --> 2:57:18.300]  source of life to our creator and they know that why do we think when everybody heard about it when
[2:57:18.300 --> 2:57:23.900]  it first came around on tv that's when people got it people started getting it all over when
[2:57:23.900 --> 2:57:32.220]  it came through the tv and so a practical way here's the me a practical way that goes and listen
[2:57:32.220 --> 2:57:36.620]  i bless doctors everybody and i appreciate you i told you i had two and a half minutes i appreciate

[3:00:10.700 --> 3:00:14.540]  let's talk to chris in north dakota thanks for holding chris
[3:00:14.540 --> 3:00:23.180]  hi alex you're here yes sir go ahead yes uh waiting uh heard you uh talk about already
[3:00:23.180 --> 3:00:27.500]  a bunch of the points i would like to get to it's just that uh everybody knows
[3:00:28.460 --> 3:00:36.060]  that ukraine is basically a vast little colony like putin said of the u.s you know russia is
[3:00:36.060 --> 3:00:40.620]  run by oligarchs and everybody knows that well but people really don't get to see
[3:00:40.620 --> 3:00:47.580]  me is that ukraine is also run by oligarchs but they are american politicians they are
[3:00:47.580 --> 3:00:56.620]  nato ambassadors they are e-u politicians and when mitt romney and nancy polosi are on the
[3:00:56.620 --> 3:01:04.380]  steadfast together of a solution you know america is in distress it's you go opposite of that thinking
[3:01:04.380 --> 3:01:12.060]  no i agree with you i mean it's on records that the west has set up an oligarchy there
[3:01:12.700 --> 3:01:18.860]  and that's what's going on and i had no idea i really didn't think that uh
[3:01:20.060 --> 3:01:28.380]  that putin would actually uh go towards um go towards kiev and i thought he would take the uh
[3:01:28.380 --> 3:01:33.740]  denetsk and luvansk region and hold them but yeah today we woke up in a different world
[3:01:36.540 --> 3:01:40.700]  well there's no doubt that the world's going into a major orchestrated crisis and
[3:01:41.260 --> 3:01:46.460]  they want to bring in a castle society global ids out of it if we must oppose those no matter
[3:01:46.460 --> 3:01:51.020]  what group or what government whether it's the russians the chinese or the us or the e-u or the
[3:01:51.020 --> 3:01:57.740]  uk or the mexicans or the whatever it is we say no to the global id we say no to the lockdowns
[3:01:57.740 --> 3:02:03.900]  we say no to the tyranny thank you for the call chris great points all right let's talk to lisa in
[3:02:03.900 --> 3:02:15.740]  rhoda island welcome hey alex hi can you hear me i can awesome so i want to thank you first of all
[3:02:15.740 --> 3:02:25.020]  for taking my call and second of all i'm in the most small city most property in the union rhoda
[3:02:25.020 --> 3:02:32.460]  island which tucker colson noted which i i'm sure you'll laugh at it's okay you're in rhoda island
[3:02:32.460 --> 3:02:40.300]  what's your take on all this i i want to thank you first of all for waking up tucker colson and
[3:02:40.300 --> 3:02:50.940]  joe rogan because i listen to them now constantly um and i i buy a lot of your stuff which i have
[3:02:50.940 --> 3:02:58.300]  all over my car and people are responding to it which is awesome my take on this is i don't think
[3:02:58.300 --> 3:03:05.500]  we should be focusing on ukraine in the news with alex jones or anybody else i think we should be
[3:03:05.500 --> 3:03:12.620]  focusing on canada our brothers our friends and what's going on there because i think that's
[3:03:12.620 --> 3:03:20.300]  important to the united states right now what is going on in canada and if we can help our canadian
[3:03:20.300 --> 3:03:26.780]  friends i think it's going to make america a little bit stronger i totally agree that this
[3:03:26.780 --> 3:03:31.740]  russia thing becomes a distraction from the economy and the open borders in canada thank you so much
[3:03:31.740 --> 3:03:36.540]  lisa god bless you from rhoda island elaine in man you got about a minute and a half go ahead thank

[3:03:43.660 --> 3:03:49.820]  because uh i just wanted to say in my opinion i think i think the whole thing is theater over
[3:03:49.820 --> 3:03:57.420]  there i think it's it's uh biden has worked a deal biden in the u n has worked a deal with
[3:03:57.420 --> 3:04:06.700]  prudent it's just my opinion that um prudent can have ukraine and uh in exchange um that they're
[3:04:06.700 --> 3:04:14.140]  going to be there biden biden is going to blame russia and prudent when uh the deep state sets off
[3:04:14.140 --> 3:04:23.900]  bombs or whatever in and and you know cancels i grid sets down i grid and i i just think
[3:04:23.900 --> 3:04:29.820]  it they're going to blame russia and it's it's been a it's been theater the whole thing elaine
[3:04:29.820 --> 3:04:33.180]  don't hang up get me if you want to give me your name and number i want you at the start of the
[3:04:33.180 --> 3:04:38.140]  show tomorrow come on for a full segment with me because i tend to think you're right just like
[3:04:38.140 --> 3:04:41.740]  hitler made a deal with stalin and then they turn against each other just like other deals

[3:05:55.980 --> 3:06:12.460]  dot com
[3:06:15.420 --> 3:06:22.940]  transmitting worldwide from the summit dot new studios in the united kingdom you are listening
[3:06:22.940 --> 3:06:31.340]  to her joseph watson you'll either everybody on what i'm sure you will agree is a quite a
[3:06:31.340 --> 3:06:40.380]  slow news day here on the 24th of february 2022 of course we had the end of covid restrictions
[3:06:40.380 --> 3:06:46.700]  full end of covid restrictions here in the uk today across europe covid restrictions are ending
[3:06:46.700 --> 3:06:53.180]  as well and lo and behold we have another great catastrophe with which to terrify the global
[3:06:53.180 --> 3:06:59.020]  population now of course i'm going to get into the latest on the russian attack on ukraine
[3:06:59.580 --> 3:07:04.460]  the narrative that has emerged though on social media of the past couple of hours and this has
[3:07:04.460 --> 3:07:12.140]  been picked up by the official at ukrain twitter account they're now moving to censor to silence
[3:07:12.140 --> 3:07:18.940]  to ostracize eventually they hope to lock up people who they will call traitors who they will
[3:07:18.940 --> 3:07:26.140]  call anti american merely for questioning nato's narrative nato's regime messaging we've seen that
[3:07:26.860 --> 3:07:32.140]  over the past couple of weeks we took a call son him coming out on fox news and basically
[3:07:32.140 --> 3:07:37.900]  saying that vladimir putin isn't to blame for high inflation in the united states he's not to blame
[3:07:37.900 --> 3:07:45.100]  for their infrastructure crisis he's not to blame for fentanyl sales he's not to blame for rising
[3:07:45.100 --> 3:07:51.740]  crime in major cities we've seen that narrative that that makes took a call son a traitor a pro
[3:07:51.740 --> 3:07:58.860]  putin asset and anti american we've seen in the british parliament today in response to this
[3:07:58.860 --> 3:08:04.460]  russia attack on ukraine mp's getting up and saying that vladimir putin should be arrested
[3:08:04.460 --> 3:08:11.100]  taken to the haig and put on a war crimes trial because flagrantly violating the sovereignty
[3:08:11.100 --> 3:08:17.740]  of independent nations and launching a bombardment against them to topple their governments is
[3:08:17.740 --> 3:08:24.140]  morally wrong and an international war crime of course only when vladimir putin does it when
[3:08:24.140 --> 3:08:30.380]  barack obama and david cameron the president prime minister did it back in 2011 with libya
[3:08:30.380 --> 3:08:37.500]  again supported rebels in the regions gave them weapons launched a complete air bombardment
[3:08:37.500 --> 3:08:42.300]  of libya taking out their air defenses just like russia did last night to the ukraine
[3:08:43.420 --> 3:08:49.180]  that was morally good that was a good thing because we're the good guys and it's okay when
[3:08:49.180 --> 3:08:55.100]  we do it okay when we send weapons to terrorists to freedom fighters as we would call them okay when
[3:08:55.100 --> 3:09:02.620]  we support support rebels in contested areas okay when we launch missile strikes on airports in
[3:09:02.620 --> 3:09:08.060]  libya that's all fine but when vladimir putin does it it's an international war crime he
[3:09:08.060 --> 3:09:13.900]  should be dragged in front of the un and anyone who gives him aid and comfort including people
[3:09:13.900 --> 3:09:19.420]  like tucker carlson should maybe not only be stripped of their free speech censored banned
[3:09:19.420 --> 3:09:27.340]  ostracized but maybe even thrown in prison in fact the word traitor is trending right now on
[3:09:27.340 --> 3:09:33.180]  twitter it has been for the past couple of hours with nigel forage saying basically that nato was
[3:09:33.180 --> 3:09:39.420]  to blame for this escalation their weakness and their unwillingness to negotiate with putin as
[3:09:39.420 --> 3:09:45.100]  it regards their expansion in the east they're to blame for this escalation for him making that
[3:09:45.100 --> 3:09:49.980]  statement he's now being accused of victim blaming yeah they're literally trotting out
[3:09:50.540 --> 3:09:55.980]  feminist narratives now and they're saying that he's lord horhor that he's like the people who
[3:09:55.980 --> 3:10:01.500]  appease hitler and that he should be punished now they're literally slowly rolling out this
[3:10:01.500 --> 3:10:07.660]  narrative that anyone who doesn't completely agree completely swallow and sign on to the
[3:10:07.660 --> 3:10:15.100]  biden white house narrative the nato narrative that they want people to believe is in fact a traitor
[3:10:15.100 --> 3:10:22.460]  and basically akin to the people who supported hitler in world war two and as i said ukraine
[3:10:22.460 --> 3:10:28.220]  is apparently banning the at rusher account on twitter is going to stop putin's war machine
[3:10:28.220 --> 3:10:34.940]  apparently just like by the way uh lighting up 10 downing street in blue and yellow colors
[3:10:34.940 --> 3:10:40.540]  as a show of support ukraine to ukraine is going to stop putin's war machine thoughts and prayers
[3:10:40.540 --> 3:10:47.500]  apparently we're yet to settle on a hashtag which will stop the t90 tanks rolling into Kiev but again
[3:10:47.500 --> 3:10:51.820]  it's uh it's probably going to have a massive effect isn't it that's the other indignity that
[3:10:51.820 --> 3:10:58.780]  we have to endure is celebrities and i'm not going to sit here and lecture you on the geopolitical
[3:10:58.780 --> 3:11:03.820]  strategy or the history of ukraine and rusher because i'm no expert on it but we have celebrities
[3:11:03.820 --> 3:11:10.460]  already coming out giving their completely worthless pointless take and trying to get people to
[3:11:10.460 --> 3:11:17.100]  quote promote narratives that back nato that back the biden white house in fact there was an article
[3:11:17.980 --> 3:11:25.580]  and this is posted on reclaim the net.org where twitter came out and they said in error
[3:11:25.580 --> 3:11:31.980]  censored a bunch of pro ukraine accounts that were posting the maneuvers the actions of russian
[3:11:31.980 --> 3:11:37.740]  military forces they said that these accounts were banned in error but listen to this a twitter
[3:11:37.740 --> 3:11:43.980]  spokesperson also said quote we've been proactively monitoring for emerging narratives that are
[3:11:43.980 --> 3:11:49.100]  violative of our policies and in this instance we took enforcement action on a number of accounts
[3:11:49.100 --> 3:11:55.740]  in error so they've openly come out and said they're monitoring in live time quote emerging
[3:11:55.740 --> 3:12:03.020]  narratives about this russia ukraine war that they will then take punitive action against so it's
[3:12:03.020 --> 3:12:10.460]  gone beyond questioning lockdowns it's gone beyond questioning the efficacy of vaccines now the social
[3:12:10.460 --> 3:12:17.420]  media censorship is moving into the sphere of banning censoring ostracizing people who question
[3:12:17.420 --> 3:12:25.260]  the narrative of war no matter which side you support or don't support in this debate so they're
[3:12:25.260 --> 3:12:30.540]  already moving on to talking about people being traitors for not saying that vladimir putin is
[3:12:30.540 --> 3:12:36.140]  basically hitler you don't even have to support him if you don't support the nato narrative then
[3:12:36.140 --> 3:12:42.780]  you might be a traitor too meanwhile anti-war protesters in downtown moscow are being quickly
[3:12:42.780 --> 3:12:49.180]  detained brutally by police and again vladimir putin he's bad for doing that maybe they should
[3:12:49.180 --> 3:12:53.500]  have their bank accounts freeze too oh sorry that's what justin true though did in canada
[3:12:53.500 --> 3:13:00.140]  that's what his riot cops did when they trampled disabled people in ottawa it's okay when we do it
[3:13:00.940 --> 3:13:07.100]  new york times reports thousands of protesters took to the streets of russian cities on thursday
[3:13:07.100 --> 3:13:11.980]  there are also some in st petersburg by the way who based on the latest video haven't been violently
[3:13:11.980 --> 3:13:18.140]  dragged away yet maybe again putin's on the phone to justin true though to get tips on how to do that
[3:13:18.140 --> 3:13:26.220]  the police detained more than 600 people in moscow alone according to a right screw also on how
[3:13:26.220 --> 3:13:34.060]  this ties into canada christia freeland the deputy prime minister in canada she of the
[3:13:34.060 --> 3:13:38.700]  incredibly bizarre nodding during press conferences which i'm going to get on to in a later segment
[3:13:39.660 --> 3:13:47.180]  she's come out and said uh that putin should quote f off and again that is something which
[3:13:47.180 --> 3:13:53.580]  will definitely stop the putin war machine you have ukrainians huddling at bomb shelters terrified
[3:13:53.580 --> 3:14:01.020]  for their lives but the deputy canadian prime minister has in the past hour told vladimir putin
[3:14:01.020 --> 3:14:07.660]  on twitter i believe to f off so another stunning act of diplomacy there of course biden in the past
[3:14:07.660 --> 3:14:14.620]  couple of hours after going to sleep last night when the bombardment began as ukraine's air
[3:14:14.620 --> 3:14:19.260]  defences were being wiped out as the military air bases were being eviscerated off the map
[3:14:20.140 --> 3:14:26.060]  as soldiers and in some cases civilians were being slaughtered what did joe biden do he went
[3:14:26.060 --> 3:14:31.980]  straight to bed the white house put out a press release last night saying that biden would only
[3:14:31.980 --> 3:14:39.100]  publicly address the issue which he did about an hour ago quote later in the afternoon there's a
[3:14:39.100 --> 3:14:45.500]  potential for a world war a massive compligration and joe biden the leader of the free world the guy
[3:14:45.500 --> 3:14:52.860]  who can't even pronounce kiev calls it kiev is basically on his third nap of the day he finally
[3:14:52.860 --> 3:14:58.780]  came out earlier today and admitted that the sanctions against putin have basically had no
[3:14:58.780 --> 3:15:05.180]  effect whatsoever so what's the solution to this latest escalation according to joe biden more
[3:15:05.180 --> 3:15:11.500]  pointless sanctions he literally said in the next sentence almost the sanctions are pointless so
[3:15:11.500 --> 3:15:16.220]  what we're going to do is have more pointless sanctions and again this is testament to the
[3:15:16.220 --> 3:15:21.500]  complete impotence and the weakness of the west and this is the video that i put out earlier
[3:15:21.500 --> 3:15:25.660]  we're going to get onto it in the next segment we're running out of time here basically the
[3:15:25.660 --> 3:15:32.300]  pentagon nato they've been transfixed with diversity with inclusion with multiculturalism
[3:15:32.300 --> 3:15:38.940]  with self loathing the west as a civilizational whole has been completely transfixed with self
[3:15:38.940 --> 3:15:45.980]  loathing for the past decade 15 years plus and now we expect these esteemed leaders to take on the
[3:15:45.980 --> 3:15:51.660]  military might of blademy of putin's war machine let's see how well that goes we'll get into that

[3:17:11.180 --> 3:17:17.260]  and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives but because of so many
[3:17:17.260 --> 3:17:23.500]  scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers now their

[3:17:30.140 --> 3:17:35.980]  takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever the problem is some globalist

[3:20:24.300 --> 3:20:31.580]  well i've been the same people who supported the uh disgraceful war crime the actual war
[3:20:31.580 --> 3:20:39.420]  crime that was the bombing of libya supporting of jihadist rebels sending weapons to thugs in
[3:20:39.420 --> 3:20:46.060]  the region toppling a regime which led of course not only to the rise of isis which is directly
[3:20:46.060 --> 3:20:52.140]  what the invasion and bombing of libya led to but of course the international migrant crisis and
[3:20:52.140 --> 3:20:58.140]  the invasion of europe itself in a different manner which was still paying the price for today
[3:20:58.940 --> 3:21:03.740]  and of course a spate innumerable mass casualty terror attacks throughout europe
[3:21:03.740 --> 3:21:08.860]  for a decade which is still happening on a basically monthly basis at this point
[3:21:08.860 --> 3:21:16.700]  because of the illegal bombardment of libya by nato the same people the us the uk who are now
[3:21:16.700 --> 3:21:22.540]  morally grandstanding over vladimir putin doing basically exactly the same thing to ukraine
[3:21:23.500 --> 3:21:29.660]  scott grier just tweeted 19 years ago american invaded a sovereign nation over made up national
[3:21:29.660 --> 3:21:34.140]  security concerns all the people behind that effort now claim that russia invading ukraine over
[3:21:34.140 --> 3:21:39.660]  national security concerns is a threat to the rules based global order very strange and of
[3:21:39.660 --> 3:21:45.020]  course we have this bizarre dichotomy where russia and china for years now have come out and said
[3:21:45.020 --> 3:21:50.140]  that they recognize that this wokeism within the united states within the west itself
[3:21:50.140 --> 3:21:56.060]  this civilizational self-loathing is basically going to cause the collapse of the west at least
[3:21:56.060 --> 3:22:02.700]  in the long term giving them the opportunity to step into the breach and impose their influence
[3:22:02.700 --> 3:22:09.020]  and this video very much touches on that subject this is woke world war here it is
[3:22:14.460 --> 3:22:20.220]  well that escalated quickly explosions right across this vast country turns out that electing
[3:22:20.220 --> 3:22:25.500]  a president who can't even say qf properly the capital city key and who responded to the attack
[3:22:25.500 --> 3:22:31.260]  by going to bed didn't deter putin the white house issued a press release saying that biden
[3:22:31.260 --> 3:22:37.340]  will publicly address the crisis sometime quote tomorrow afternoon presumably after he
[3:22:37.340 --> 3:22:42.620]  wakes up from his third nap of the day meanwhile nancy polosi doesn't even know what country russia
[3:22:42.620 --> 3:22:52.700]  invaded turns out that repealing trump's ban on transgenders in the military didn't deter putin
[3:22:52.700 --> 3:22:57.900]  turns out that the pentagon's effort to help non-binary people who identify as they them serve
[3:22:57.900 --> 3:23:03.340]  openly in the military didn't deter putin putin's manly recruitment ads stand no chance against
[3:23:03.340 --> 3:23:08.460]  ukraine's they them army really how did that work out for you turns out nato's commitment
[3:23:08.460 --> 3:23:16.060]  to inclusion and diversity didn't deter putin and nato diversity is our strength putin waited
[3:23:16.060 --> 3:23:21.660]  until the west was weekly led low on patriotism and manhood with the media obsessed over domestic
[3:23:21.660 --> 3:23:27.420]  trivialities and politicians with a punch on for waging war on their own citizens perfect timing
[3:23:27.420 --> 3:23:32.140]  meanwhile there still seems to be a lot of confusion about whether this represents a world war
[3:23:32.140 --> 3:23:37.580]  or merely woke war war i feel like i'm watching george floyd die again only the country version
[3:23:37.580 --> 3:23:40.940]  we all stand around knowing this is wrong but help us to stop it what can we do
[3:23:40.940 --> 3:23:44.940]  hashtag ukraine is george floyd reports that russian spetsnaz soldiers have already begun
[3:23:44.940 --> 3:23:49.340]  tearing down george floyd murals and key have been denied i've got a question for you do you think
[3:23:49.340 --> 3:23:55.340]  what putin's done is worse than racism but putin said he attacked ukraine to fight the nancy's
[3:23:55.340 --> 3:24:00.460]  wait didn't the legacy media and political class just spend the last five years telling us that
[3:24:00.460 --> 3:24:06.620]  political violence is justified so long as you're fighting nancy's antifa literally means antifascism
[3:24:06.620 --> 3:24:11.980]  they're fighting nancy's how could you oppose that putin literally used the antifa excuse
[3:24:11.980 --> 3:24:18.060]  we're fighting nancy's therefore we're virtuous isn't putin just on a grand scale punching a
[3:24:18.060 --> 3:24:23.340]  nancy so yeah save me the contrived sanctum any of a political class that has venerated
[3:24:23.340 --> 3:24:28.380]  political violence as a force for moral good suddenly wetting the bed in response to an
[3:24:28.380 --> 3:24:33.580]  overwhelming show of political violence save me the feigned outrage of a legacy media that
[3:24:33.580 --> 3:24:39.100]  dismissed and ignored the riotous destruction of american cities now being up in arms about the
[3:24:39.100 --> 3:24:44.460]  destruction of ukrainian airports a fiery but mostly peaceful obliteration of ukraine's entire
[3:24:44.460 --> 3:24:55.900]  military infrastructure
[3:25:03.980 --> 3:25:10.460]  save me the crocodile tears of nato apologists the same people who vehemently supported nato
[3:25:10.460 --> 3:25:16.700]  bombing libya in much the same manner that russia bombed ukraine save me the moral grandstanding
[3:25:16.700 --> 3:25:22.540]  of people who hate america saying americans who don't blindly swallow biden white house narratives
[3:25:22.540 --> 3:25:27.820]  are anti-american traitors the way the right wing is openly rooting for russia and its authoritarian
[3:25:27.820 --> 3:25:33.260]  leader is one of the most amazing things i've ever seen save me the copensee of those who voted for
[3:25:33.260 --> 3:25:39.740]  the deep state war administration now suddenly complaining about war sold uranium to russia
[3:25:39.740 --> 3:25:45.500]  democrats crime are invaded democrats us domestic pipeline shut down democrats nuclear power halted
[3:25:45.500 --> 3:25:50.940]  democrats ukraine invaded again democrats starting to notice a pattern now the same people who
[3:25:50.940 --> 3:25:56.860]  usually hate the mere concept of nation states and borders have all added the ukraine flag to their
[3:25:56.860 --> 3:26:01.420]  twitter bio one thing about the democrat ukraine russia narrative is that it serves the purpose
[3:26:01.420 --> 3:26:06.780]  of giving liberals a sort of pseudo patriotism to use as a virtue signal this takes the place of
[3:26:06.780 --> 3:26:12.140]  their obvious lack of real patriotism they will use it to look down on you as an anti-american
[3:26:12.140 --> 3:26:18.940]  220 000 illegal immigrants have evaded us authorities since october america's borders are about as
[3:26:18.940 --> 3:26:23.740]  resilient as a chocolate fireguard yet the same people who champion all that are suddenly all
[3:26:23.740 --> 3:26:29.580]  big mad about ukraine's border being violated german chancellor ola schultz warned borris johnson
[3:26:29.580 --> 3:26:34.220]  that germany would not support kicking russia out of swift and neither would the e you not stream
[3:26:34.220 --> 3:26:39.900]  gas cooks wow turns out europe being totally dependent on utterly inadequate green energy
[3:26:39.900 --> 3:26:46.220]  isn't a good idea does the west have the resolve to face down putin or has years of civilizational
[3:26:46.220 --> 3:26:52.540]  self loathing finally taken its toll while russia wipes out a country's entire air defense system
[3:26:52.540 --> 3:26:56.700]  the us john chiefs of staff are more concerned about wiping out racism i want to understand
[3:26:56.700 --> 3:27:01.980]  white rage and i'm white while china moves to snuff out taiwan the pentagon moves to snuff out
[3:27:01.980 --> 3:27:07.260]  white privilege autocratic leaders believe in hyper masculinity raw physical power they believe
[3:27:07.260 --> 3:27:13.100]  that might make right america has spent decades fetishizing soft cuddly emotional power putin
[3:27:13.100 --> 3:27:19.580]  and g don't respect it at all this is the result and how confident would you be in say 20 years time
[3:27:19.580 --> 3:27:26.300]  in the american military the way it's heading successfully defending americans in a war against
[3:27:26.300 --> 3:27:31.340]  russia and china as i already explained in a previous video the state department was told
[3:27:31.340 --> 3:27:37.740]  directly that china thinks wokeism will subvert and collapse the west now putin is imposing his
[3:27:37.740 --> 3:27:42.780]  will safe in the knowledge that the biden white house and the us deep state are seemingly more
[3:27:42.780 --> 3:27:48.140]  concerned about the threat posed by american parents who complain about critical race theory at
[3:27:48.140 --> 3:27:53.820]  school board meetings than they are about actual foreign adversaries and then we're left with the
[3:27:53.820 --> 3:28:02.060]  key question would any of this have happened under trump there we have it and i'm not even
[3:28:02.060 --> 3:28:07.660]  joking i'm not being flippant about this whole wokeism thing the initial response and not just
[3:28:07.660 --> 3:28:13.740]  on twitter with the ukrainian flag in the bios with the hashtags with the thoughts and prayers
[3:28:14.380 --> 3:28:21.180]  the initial response to this from the uk prime minister boris johnson has to been to highlight
[3:28:21.180 --> 3:28:28.460]  the fact that they've put up a blue and yellow impose flag over downing street they flashed
[3:28:28.460 --> 3:28:34.540]  blue and yellow colors onto the front of downing street and that's their response their response
[3:28:34.540 --> 3:28:41.340]  to this invasion this brutal attack is just another virtue signal and now in the past 30 minutes
[3:28:41.340 --> 3:28:46.780]  he's on twitter bragging about it oh my god look where good people wear virtue signaling

[3:34:00.300 --> 3:34:05.740]  government of the united kingdom is blasting the colors of the ukraine flag onto the front of the
[3:34:05.740 --> 3:34:13.100]  building of 10 downing street that's sure to stop putin's war machine and then we have this this is
[3:34:13.100 --> 3:34:22.060]  at the times this is from today spice top this is british spies this is james bond right spies told
[3:34:22.060 --> 3:34:27.980]  mind your privileged language this is what's this is what's important according to our military
[3:34:27.980 --> 3:34:33.980]  industrial complex and we wonder why putin sees us as weak and impotent british spies
[3:34:33.980 --> 3:34:38.780]  have been encouraged to consider their white privilege bear in mind that literally the
[3:34:38.780 --> 3:34:44.060]  joint chiefs of staff as i highlighted in that video came out after january six and said that
[3:34:44.060 --> 3:34:51.500]  quote white rage was one of their major concerns not china taking tywin no white people in the
[3:34:51.500 --> 3:34:56.940]  united states exercising their white rage british spies have been encouraged to consider their white
[3:34:56.940 --> 3:35:04.780]  privilege and avoid gendered terms such as manpower in a guide to improving diversity and inclusion
[3:35:04.780 --> 3:35:11.900]  in the security services it was reported last night they're literally wasting time on telling them
[3:35:11.900 --> 3:35:19.100]  don't use the word manpower rather than educating them training them on how to spy on our adversaries
[3:35:19.100 --> 3:35:27.500]  this is taking up resources and time this is why we're seen as fools by china by russia
[3:35:28.300 --> 3:35:34.700]  believed doc and they say it i had a video on it last week 10 years ago the us state
[3:35:34.700 --> 3:35:41.740]  department was told directly in a voluminous report stop hyper focusing on all this identity
[3:35:41.740 --> 3:35:48.060]  politics woke crap 10 years ago they were told this because it's a weakness and china thinks
[3:35:48.060 --> 3:35:52.220]  that they're not even going to have to do anything that it's going to lead to the collapse of version
[3:35:52.220 --> 3:35:59.180]  of your society's demoralization of your societies without them having to lift a finger the leak
[3:35:59.180 --> 3:36:06.780]  document also advises mi5 and mi6 officers that's james bond not to use words such as strong and grip
[3:36:07.660 --> 3:36:13.660]  because they can reinforce dominant cultural patterns oh my god i'm sure the russian spets
[3:36:13.660 --> 3:36:19.500]  nat soldiers are quaking in their boots they're going to meet people they're going to get spied on
[3:36:19.500 --> 3:36:25.660]  they're going to get interrupted by people who are afraid of using the word strong the advice
[3:36:26.940 --> 3:36:32.860]  again they're quaking they're crapping bricks the advice titled mission critical was thought to have
[3:36:32.860 --> 3:36:39.340]  been written by sir steven lovegrove the national security advisor in october and to have raised
[3:36:39.340 --> 3:36:44.460]  concern in other areas of government critics have argued that security officials should have been
[3:36:44.460 --> 3:36:51.580]  less focused on inclusion more alert to events in afghanistan and ukraine oh dear thing no we need
[3:36:51.580 --> 3:36:59.180]  to worry about offensive words the taliban's taken over afghanistan china's about to invade taiwan
[3:36:59.180 --> 3:37:05.420]  take it back they basically took back hong kong russia's taken ukraine but no we're worried about
[3:37:05.420 --> 3:37:15.500]  the word strong and manpower pathetic brendan o'neill writes in spite on this issue quote you couldn't
[3:37:15.500 --> 3:37:20.860]  ask for a clearer snapshot of the divide between the west and russia today in the west institutions
[3:37:20.860 --> 3:37:26.620]  are riddled with political correctness incapacitated by wokeness and increasingly incapable of being
[3:37:26.620 --> 3:37:32.860]  serious about any almost any issue including geopolitics and in russia there's a leader
[3:37:32.860 --> 3:37:40.140]  who is a keen observer of this western decay as he sees it remember remember uh zuren oski i made a
[3:37:40.140 --> 3:37:46.780]  video on this as well he said that white americans would literally end up fleeing to syberia because
[3:37:46.780 --> 3:37:53.900]  of the domestic political strife being fostered by these same regime deep state forces within the
[3:37:53.900 --> 3:38:00.780]  united states itself he continues the west is beset by socio-cultural disturbance as putin
[3:38:00.780 --> 3:38:06.860]  recently said they recognize this where basically commit and cultural suicide where russia and
[3:38:06.860 --> 3:38:11.740]  deputant is reviving pride and nostalgia for russian history at least the version of history
[3:38:11.740 --> 3:38:17.020]  that the putin regime prefers in the west they pursue the aggressive deletion of whole pages
[3:38:17.020 --> 3:38:23.500]  of their own history that's a quote from putin again this civilizational self-loathing that
[3:38:23.500 --> 3:38:31.500]  puts us on such a pathetic week back for he continues quote the west is too busy teaching
[3:38:31.500 --> 3:38:36.140]  that a boy can become a girl and vice versa to be able to defend its own traditions and
[3:38:36.140 --> 3:38:43.100]  truths putin chastisers and now we have british security bosses obsessing over pronouns as putin
[3:38:43.100 --> 3:38:50.540]  spies more territory for the russian federation fiddling while ukraine burns absolutely incredible
[3:38:50.540 --> 3:38:58.220]  but again i'm sure again transposing the ukraine flag on downing street will deter putin once he
[3:38:58.220 --> 3:39:06.700]  sees that the t90 tanks get pulled back immediately meanwhile the ukrainian president and this is
[3:39:06.700 --> 3:39:12.940]  actually a news story today zolensky while his country is being invaded and bombarded while
[3:39:12.940 --> 3:39:18.460]  his military infrastructure is being completely wiped out guess what the president of ukraine is
[3:39:18.460 --> 3:39:28.140]  doing he's conducting a sit-down interview for a documentary with shorn penn remember that guy
[3:39:28.140 --> 3:39:33.100]  who is the guy in south asetia the georgian president where he was eating his own hair
[3:39:33.100 --> 3:39:39.020]  while the russians were invading that's basically the equivalent information liberation reports
[3:39:40.300 --> 3:39:45.260]  zolensky finds time to chat with shorn penn for documentary amid russian siege
[3:39:45.260 --> 3:39:51.420]  ukraine's comedian president vladimir zolensky took the time to speak with actor shorn penn
[3:39:51.420 --> 3:39:56.860]  as part of a documentary on the russian invasion as his military was being destroyed yeah you'd
[3:39:56.860 --> 3:40:01.900]  think he'd have quite a full schedule today don't you you think that the shorn penn documentary
[3:40:01.900 --> 3:40:08.060]  interview would get pushed back a little bit now zolensky released the embarrassing video himself
[3:40:08.060 --> 3:40:13.660]  thursday on instagram writing quote the more such people in our country now true friends of ukraine
[3:40:13.660 --> 3:40:17.980]  who support the struggle for freedom the sooner it will be possible for to stop russia's treacherous
[3:40:17.980 --> 3:40:24.780]  attack yeah i'm sure him doing a sit-down interview in a shorn penn documentary is really going to
[3:40:24.780 --> 3:40:33.660]  deter the might of the russian military absolutely incredible zero hedge reports russian forces seize

[3:42:06.620 --> 3:42:14.300]  yes grip the word not using the word grip is more of a concern than fighting the spying on

[3:45:58.220 --> 3:46:04.460]  wrong tree calling this gain of function research now if you read the actual you know 2014 legislation
[3:46:04.460 --> 3:46:10.620]  the u.s government gain of function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected
[3:46:10.620 --> 3:46:15.100]  gain of function research involving influenza mers and dars viruses there's nothing about
[3:46:15.100 --> 3:46:20.860]  czar's like viruses and it's a research funding pause it's not a stop it's not a prohibition it's
[3:46:20.860 --> 3:46:25.180]  when you come to a four-way intersection there's the stop sign you stop you look both ways and then
[3:46:25.180 --> 3:46:30.460]  you proceed and so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function just selected gain of function
[3:46:30.460 --> 3:46:35.340]  but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research so
[3:46:35.340 --> 3:46:39.260]  you know rand and others you know maybe fouchy was right they don't quite know what they're talking
[3:46:39.260 --> 3:46:43.180]  about calling it gain of function you know that's why he didn't perjure himself that's why he hasn't
[3:46:43.180 --> 3:46:47.340]  been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic live forms that mimic what the
[3:46:47.340 --> 3:46:52.380]  viruses do but in the main definition it's still a gain of function you're making something deadly
[3:46:52.380 --> 3:46:58.460]  that spreads more easily to hurt people thank you mike we love you leading a frontal assault on the
[3:46:58.460 --> 3:47:15.260]  lies of the new world order it's alex jones live from london england it's paul joseph watson
[3:47:15.260 --> 3:47:25.980]  with summit dot news so the same legacy media the same political class that says borders are bad
[3:47:25.980 --> 3:47:33.420]  national sovereignty is bad ownership of private ownership of firearms is bad patriotism patriotism
[3:47:33.420 --> 3:47:41.980]  is bad suddenly that's all good but only in the context of ukraine you had cnn yesterday come out
[3:47:41.980 --> 3:47:47.340]  again this is a tweet from john berman the ukrainians will fight like hell if every ukrainian
[3:47:47.340 --> 3:47:53.180]  takes a gun russians don't have a prayer what so the second amendment's good now and in fact on
[3:47:53.180 --> 3:48:00.300]  that very subject spectator index reports ukraine's interior minister announces 10 000 automatic
[3:48:00.300 --> 3:48:06.940]  rifles have been distributed to civilians in kiev suddenly private ownership of guns is a good thing
[3:48:06.940 --> 3:48:15.580]  what a turnaround now i was talking before the break about the mod telling british spies to use
[3:48:15.580 --> 3:48:21.660]  the correct pronouns to not use words such as manpower strong and grip because that could offend
[3:48:21.660 --> 3:48:27.500]  people these are our spies who are literally tasked with combating mosco and beijing but
[3:48:27.500 --> 3:48:32.460]  they're being taught educated trained that the words they use the sounds that come out of their
[3:48:32.460 --> 3:48:40.700]  mouths are more important well on the day that russia bombards ukraine the mod lgbt network
[3:48:42.380 --> 3:48:48.060]  which apparently is a thing that's come out and darin grimes just tweeted this i retweeted it
[3:48:48.940 --> 3:48:55.100]  and they say to again this is mod this is the british military industrial complex ministry
[3:48:55.100 --> 3:49:01.740]  of defense today for lgbt history month we hosted a coffee morning in the main building which had a
[3:49:01.740 --> 3:49:07.660]  great turnout in the afternoon we hosted a book club webinar where we discussed our favorite lgbt
[3:49:07.660 --> 3:49:14.700]  plus books while bladimir putin was bombarding ukraine this is what our ministry of defense was
[3:49:14.700 --> 3:49:21.020]  talking about what is your favorite book and why and then they have a couple of handy definitions
[3:49:21.020 --> 3:49:26.700]  including pansexual refers to a person who's romantic and or sexual attraction towards others
[3:49:26.700 --> 3:49:33.740]  is not limited by sex or gender this is the ministry of defense doing a virtue signal
[3:49:33.740 --> 3:49:39.420]  tweet about how they had had a gay coffee book club event earlier today
[3:49:41.180 --> 3:49:47.900]  putin and president g are indeed laughing at us let's try and cover some other news though
[3:49:47.900 --> 3:49:53.740]  in this final eight minutes let's go to the video now because of course we had the brutal
[3:49:53.740 --> 3:50:00.460]  treatment of the canadian protesters by the trudeau regime again it's only bad when protesters are
[3:50:00.460 --> 3:50:06.060]  getting violently brutalized and denied their free speech it's only bad when putin does it
[3:50:06.060 --> 3:50:10.860]  when trudeau sends in the riot cops and the police horses to trample disabled people
[3:50:10.860 --> 3:50:17.340]  it's liberal and progressive they abandoned or declared that the emergencies act was now over
[3:50:17.340 --> 3:50:22.380]  it was revoked of course yesterday despite simultaneously saying that they would keep
[3:50:22.380 --> 3:50:28.620]  provisions of the emergencies act seizing bank accounts freezing assets of people who merely
[3:50:28.620 --> 3:50:35.420]  donated to the canadian freedom convoy truckers including single mothers who donated fifty dollars
[3:50:36.060 --> 3:50:42.140]  before the trudeau regime even declared it all illegitimate and trudeau had a press conference
[3:50:42.140 --> 3:50:50.060]  but people noted his deputy prime minister in the background who has this bizarre facial tick
[3:50:50.060 --> 3:50:55.820]  where she nods throughout in a way which is absolutely bizarre let's go to the video it
[3:50:55.820 --> 3:51:03.100]  speaks for itself the video is called weird nodding woman and here it is one thing almost as grating
[3:51:03.100 --> 3:51:08.940]  as the trudeau regime's brutalist authoritarianism is this kind of glib assumed moral high ground
[3:51:08.940 --> 3:51:14.140]  sanctum only used to disguise it and while the lights sliver out of trudeau's serpent like
[3:51:14.140 --> 3:51:21.580]  mouth his deputy prime minister christia freeland behaves like this in a democracy you can protest
[3:51:21.580 --> 3:51:27.740]  you can share your opinion at the top of your lungs you can disagree with elected officials
[3:51:27.740 --> 3:51:35.900]  you can certainly disagree with me but you can't harass your fellow citizens who disagree with you
[3:51:36.860 --> 3:51:43.980]  you can't hold a city hostage you can't block a critical trade corridor and deprive people of
[3:51:43.980 --> 3:51:51.660]  their jobs you can't attack journalists for reporting which is essential to our democracy
[3:51:52.940 --> 3:52:02.780]  what you can do is vote what you can do is run for office that's how change happens
[3:52:02.780 --> 3:52:09.500]  in a democracy in a democracy you can protest you can share your opinion at the top of your
[3:52:09.500 --> 3:52:14.060]  what are you doing do you think relentlessly nodding like that somehow makes your behavior
[3:52:14.060 --> 3:52:20.060]  righteous this is the same woman who just announced that parts of the odious emergencies act will
[3:52:20.060 --> 3:52:24.940]  become permanent namely the part where people can have their assets stripped and bank accounts
[3:52:24.940 --> 3:52:30.620]  frozen merely for expressing an anti-regime opinion by donating to political causes they
[3:52:30.620 --> 3:52:36.940]  support single mothers who donated fifty dollars to the freedom convoy even before the trudeau
[3:52:36.940 --> 3:52:43.340]  regime declared it illegitimate are having their bank account seized that's nothing short of vile
[3:52:43.340 --> 3:52:49.100]  so why do you seem so proud of yourself which is essential to our democracy you're an enforcement
[3:52:49.100 --> 3:52:55.180]  goon for a malevolent globalist regime that targets good honest hardworking people merely for
[3:52:55.180 --> 3:53:00.220]  opposing your agenda you don't have the moral high ground so what's all this weird affirmative
[3:53:00.220 --> 3:53:06.780]  nodding about you're trying to convince yourself or what vote when you have captain blackface
[3:53:06.780 --> 3:53:14.140]  himself canada and our allies will defend democracy we are taking these actions today
[3:53:14.700 --> 3:53:22.540]  to stand against authoritarianism the people of ukraine like all people must be free to
[3:53:22.540 --> 3:53:28.140]  determine their own future yeah because you're the perfect voice to speak out against authoritarianism
[3:53:28.140 --> 3:53:33.580]  aren't you you just sent riot cops and police horses to trample disabled people for exercising
[3:53:33.580 --> 3:53:38.940]  basic free speech and you've got the nerve to lecture anyone else about authoritarianism
[3:53:38.940 --> 3:53:44.540]  and there she is again the nodder-in-chief doing her best Mussolini impersonation
[3:53:47.260 --> 3:53:51.420]  doesn't matter how many times you do it doesn't make you a good person doesn't make what you've
[3:53:51.420 --> 3:53:56.460]  inflicted on canadians anything other than what it is an utter disgrace
[3:53:56.460 --> 3:54:06.620]  now let's talk briefly in this final few minutes about the 100% safe and effective vaccine of
[3:54:06.620 --> 3:54:10.380]  course the vaccine mandate was what the canadian truckers are protesting against
[3:54:10.380 --> 3:54:14.380]  we've already got trampled by police horses because just intruders so progressive
[3:54:15.420 --> 3:54:21.340]  daily skeptic reports coronavirus key genetic sequence for fueling cleavage site
[3:54:21.340 --> 3:54:28.620]  patented by moderna in 2016 daily mail has the story fresh suspicion that covid may have been
[3:54:28.620 --> 3:54:33.660]  tinkered within a lab emerged today after scientists found genetic material owned by
[3:54:33.660 --> 3:54:41.660]  moderna in the virus's spike protein oh really this is awkward isn't it they identified a tiny
[3:54:41.660 --> 3:54:47.420]  snippet of code that is identical to part of a gene patented by the vaccine maker three years
[3:54:47.420 --> 3:54:53.900]  before the pandemic it was discovered in SARS-CoV-2's unique fueling cleavage site the part that
[3:54:53.900 --> 3:54:59.420]  makes it so good at infecting people and separates it from other coronaviruses geo and what could
[3:54:59.420 --> 3:55:05.580]  have been going on there daily skeptic also reports vaccine side effects up to 10 times higher than
[3:55:05.580 --> 3:55:10.700]  official figures but again it's 100% safe and effective the board member of a large german
[3:55:10.700 --> 3:55:15.260]  insurance company has spoken out of the alarming data his company has found regarding covid vaccine
[3:55:15.260 --> 3:55:21.020]  side effects which don't exist because it's 100% safe and effective up to the end of 2021 the german
[3:55:21.020 --> 3:55:29.260]  government recorded 245 thousand vaccine side effects however the analysis by health insurance
[3:55:29.260 --> 3:55:37.180]  company bbk provider suggests the true figure is up to 10 times higher but again it's 100%
[3:55:37.180 --> 3:55:43.980]  safe and effective so safe and effective that several times a week now we have medical emergencies
[3:55:43.980 --> 3:55:50.060]  at english football matches where either the players at the peak of their physical condition
[3:55:50.060 --> 3:55:54.460]  suddenly collapse on the pitch after three minutes with heart problems and breathing problems
[3:55:55.020 --> 3:56:00.460]  or indeed magic medical emergencies in the stands with the spectators watching the game
[3:56:01.420 --> 3:56:07.580]  headline english football match hit with yet another medical emergency this took place on
[3:56:07.580 --> 3:56:13.500]  tuesday night at the sundal and burton albion match which had to be delayed by nearly an hour
[3:56:13.500 --> 3:56:19.180]  after a fan collapsed in the stadium and again this happens several times a week
[3:56:19.820 --> 3:56:25.980]  obviously if you get 20 30 000 people attending a game some of them are going to collapse because
[3:56:25.980 --> 3:56:31.900]  the vaccine is 100% safe and effective referee robert lewis was forced to suspend the game after
[3:56:31.900 --> 3:56:37.180]  just four minutes after a supporter situated in sundal and west and required treatment
[3:56:38.540 --> 3:56:42.540]  and of course the german newspaper bill in a zeitung published a report seeking to answer
[3:56:42.540 --> 3:56:48.220]  why quote an unusually large number of professional and amateur soccer players have collapsed recently
[3:56:48.220 --> 3:56:53.660]  but then experts chimed in the fact checkers looked into it don't worry move along there's
[3:56:53.660 --> 3:56:59.420]  nothing to see here they said that this massive unprecedented increase in footballers and people
[3:56:59.420 --> 3:57:05.420]  who watch football matches suddenly collapsing for no apparent reason whatsoever is just one big
[3:57:05.420 --> 3:57:12.620]  coincidence meanwhile four million french discover their vaccine passport has expired
[3:57:12.620 --> 3:57:17.660]  because they didn't get the latest booster the dystopian sign of our social credit score future
[3:57:17.660 --> 3:57:21.740]  four million french people woke up to discover their vaccine passport has suddenly expired
[3:57:21.740 --> 3:57:26.220]  because they hadn't got the latest booster shot and then who knows maybe in the future
[3:57:26.780 --> 3:57:33.180]  your permission your passport to go to a bar a restaurant a entertainment venue wherever
[3:57:33.180 --> 3:57:38.780]  may suddenly expire if you express the wrong opinions about russia's invasion of ukraine
[3:57:38.780 --> 3:57:44.140]  on social media because that's where it's all going that's it warram is next summit don't use
[3:57:44.140 --> 3:57:50.620]  don't go away anything of real quality anything of lasting durability anything that's really
[3:57:50.620 --> 3:57:57.020]  satisfying and empowering and fulfilling it's going to be hard to attain and when it comes
[3:57:57.020 --> 3:58:04.620]  to information boy is that true today we see the entire global corrupt anti-human depopulation
[3:58:04.620 --> 3:58:11.100]  great recent combine trying to collapse our society to build on tashes their their transhumanist
[3:58:11.100 --> 3:58:17.900]  nightmare vision suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and
[3:58:17.900 --> 3:58:24.140]  scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives their covetous area their world's
