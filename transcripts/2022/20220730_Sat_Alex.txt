[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]  It's Saturday, July 30th.
[00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:13.508]  What to feed our ever-expanding world?
[00:00:13.348 --> 00:00:20.347]  Emergency broadcast. InfoWars. Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:20.347 --> 00:00:34.347]   They want you to eat bugs. What to feed our ever expanding world? Insects. They could feed the world.
[00:00:34.918 --> 00:00:35.358]  Healthy.
[00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.023]  They're full of polyunsaturated fat, protein, and micronutrients.
[00:00:39.363 --> 00:00:40.264]  And sustainable.
[00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:45.270]  I'm Nicole Kidman and I am going to eat a four-course meal of bugs.
[00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:53.520]  And they want you to eat these bugs inside a massive prison system that sees humanity as a cancer upon the earth.
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.584]  For too long, humanity has existed within dysfunctional and polluted cities that ignore nature.
[00:01:00.544 --> 00:01:04.367]  Now, a revolution in civilization is taking place.
[00:01:05.808 --> 00:01:09.449]  Imagine a traditional city and consolidating its footprint.
[00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.571]  Designing to protect and enhance nature.
[00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:19.953]  The Line will be home to 9 million residents and will be built with a footprint of just 34 square kilometers.
[00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:25.095]  And we are designing it to provide a healthier, more sustainable quality of life.
[00:01:26.576 --> 00:01:29.577]  The Line's communities are organized in three dimensions.
[00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:35.591]  Residents have access to all their daily needs within five-minute walk neighborhoods.
[00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:45.886]  And the line's infrastructure makes it possible to travel end-to-end in 20 minutes with no need for cars, resulting in zero carbon emissions.
[00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:53.769]  It is all completely bizarre, but it's just the cover story for a massive depopulation agenda.
[00:01:54.209 --> 00:02:06.139]  The COVID-19 vaccines are destroying the recipients' reproductive and immune systems, and killing people over time with mysterious structures growing within the vascular system.
[00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.904]  We are now seeing this all over the world, and it's just getting started.
[00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:19.174]  There is a whole cultural movement now emerging from the shadows that wants humanity to collectively commit suicide.
[00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:32.069]  This anti-human cult has been around for decades and outside of academia have had to tread quietly because much of humanity is opposed to mass murder.
[00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:42.717]  But now that we are in the midst of this cult's massive depopulation effort, they are coming out into the open to convince us that it would be best for most of us to die.
[00:02:42.817 --> 00:02:46.120]  We cannot hide away from human population growth.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.162]  Because, you know, it underlies so many of the other problems.
[00:02:50.222 --> 00:02:57.987]  All these things we talk about wouldn't be a problem if there were... if there was the size of population that there was five hundred years ago.
[00:02:58.007 --> 00:03:01.889]  All the religious groups are against me because I'm talking about population.
[00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.732]  They want more souls, I want less on the planet.
[00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:16.844]  The World Economic Forum has become the public domain of the anti-human cult's depopulation agenda.
[00:03:17.344 --> 00:03:22.145]  And all of pop culture is on board, from Hollywood to the Holy See.
[00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:28.368]  Our planet, the utopia that we've been given, the overpopulation.
[00:03:30.014 --> 00:03:36.599]  Their agenda is disguised as environmentalism, so that all who oppose it now can be shamed.
[00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:44.165]  And when the mass starvation begins to overwhelm the population, the sentimental environmentalists can all be blamed.
[00:03:44.845 --> 00:03:48.208]  Because, of course, this has nothing to do with the environment.
[00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:53.191]  Boris Johnson's father, Stanley Johnson, is a member of this cult.
[00:03:53.712 --> 00:03:59.056]  And he wrote that the world's population needs to be cut down to a more manageable number.
[00:03:59.596 --> 00:04:00.897]  And this is what it's all about.
[00:04:01.478 --> 00:04:03.079]  A more manageable number.
[00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.262]  Because these psychopaths see the rest of us as their property.
[00:04:07.803 --> 00:04:10.024]  To manage and cull accordingly.
[00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:12.486]  But humanity still has a choice.
[00:04:13.067 --> 00:04:16.690]  And we don't have to die in a prison death factory eating bugs.
[00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.933]  We could choose freedom, but time is running out.
[00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:24.754]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:24.754 --> 00:04:43.754]  [Music]
[00:04:43.754 --> 00:04:47.594]  Saturday, July 30th, 2022.
[00:04:47.712 --> 00:04:49.373]  Emergency broadcast is live.
[00:04:51.914 --> 00:04:55.816]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:04:57.216 --> 00:05:02.216]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.216 --> 00:05:14.495]   We are the human resistance against the neo-Nazi technocratic technocracy of the New World
[00:05:14.495 --> 00:05:17.495]  Order masquerading as neoliberalism.
[00:05:17.565 --> 00:05:19.946]  We are the human supremacists.
[00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:21.526]  All humans welcome.
[00:05:22.086 --> 00:05:26.407]  All enemies of humanity will be defeated and will be pushed into the sea.
[00:05:27.227 --> 00:05:29.928]  Thank you for joining us on this Emergency Saturday Transmission.
[00:05:34.028 --> 00:05:36.812]  We're very clear now how real all this is, everybody.
[00:05:36.832 --> 00:05:38.314]  We won't be able to hide anymore.
[00:05:38.334 --> 00:05:41.339]  And I know because you've come here, you're not hiding.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.541]  You want the truth.
[00:05:42.581 --> 00:05:43.242]  You know the truth.
[00:05:43.282 --> 00:05:44.203]  You've seen it for yourself.
[00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:45.625]  You don't need me to tell you.
[00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:47.288]  And you want to fight back.
[00:05:50.354 --> 00:05:52.995]  We got a huge Saturday broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:05:53.556 --> 00:06:10.303]  I've been extremely distracted in the last week with this show trial in Austin, Texas, where the corrupt Soros-backed New World Order judge, former CPS child grabber, found me guilty in both the Sandy Hook lawsuits against me.
[00:06:10.863 --> 00:06:12.124]  Same with the Connecticut judge.
[00:06:13.544 --> 00:06:15.045]  In defaults, unprecedented.
[00:06:15.065 --> 00:06:18.747]  Defaults are if you don't show up or give over any documents.
[00:06:18.787 --> 00:06:19.447]  We did everything.
[00:06:22.034 --> 00:06:27.616]  And she's telling the jury every day he is guilty, and she's told me and my lawyers, we can't say we're innocent.
[00:06:27.956 --> 00:06:30.697]  This has never before been seen by anybody.
[00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:35.559]  Even mainline law sites are saying this is unprecedented.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.001]  Texas Monthly says it's unprecedented, but I deserve it because I'm a bad person.
[00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:50.065]  Just like they set the precedent with yours truly to deplatform folks and censor people en masse and debunk us as a beta test for everybody else, it's now happening to us.
[00:06:51.598 --> 00:06:52.559]  I'm going to hit that first.
[00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:58.203]  Exclusive information on InfoWars parent company.
[00:06:58.223 --> 00:07:03.687]  When I say InfoWars, I mean the show, I mean the crew or operations.
[00:07:04.988 --> 00:07:10.212]  Free speech systems went into bankruptcy Friday.
[00:07:11.734 --> 00:07:14.556]  And the reason I did that, I'll explain here in just a moment.
[00:07:14.576 --> 00:07:15.957]  Then we're going to hit what's really important.
[00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:17.949]  Why they want to take us out.
[00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:22.451]  We can't be on air during the next phase of the designed global collapse.
[00:07:22.991 --> 00:07:28.632]  You saw that incredibly powerful Gregory's report that just went live a few hours ago at Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[00:07:29.112 --> 00:07:32.013]  The environmentalist Trojan horse of the depopulation death cult.
[00:07:33.054 --> 00:07:45.597]  And I made a film in 1997 talking about walled off cities and in 2007 talking about walled off cities where you live within a wall and aren't allowed to leave it.
[00:07:47.022 --> 00:07:51.443]  Well, now that's being announced to be built in Canada, the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and other areas.
[00:07:52.163 --> 00:07:56.864]  They plan to demolish everything and force you into these coffin-like city systems.
[00:07:57.884 --> 00:07:59.204]  So, that's all coming up.
[00:07:59.764 --> 00:08:03.025]  UN World Economic Forum behind global war on farmers.
[00:08:03.505 --> 00:08:06.386]  A big, thick, zero-hedge article that I can tell you is dead on.
[00:08:07.066 --> 00:08:09.326]  The Epoch Times also reported it originally.
[00:08:10.306 --> 00:08:17.423]   And it goes through their admissions of how they are You know, war against farmers all over the world and here in the United States.
[00:08:18.324 --> 00:08:25.447]  Global food crisis, restaurant czar, biggest restaurant, expects winter shortages, tells public to stock up now.
[00:08:26.948 --> 00:08:31.691]  I've talked to all the, not all, but a lot of the people that are involved, the highest levels of food production.
[00:08:32.131 --> 00:08:37.214]  They say it is, it is incredible what is already unfolding and what is about to happen.
[00:08:37.634 --> 00:08:39.595]  That is all coming up today.
[00:08:42.924 --> 00:09:01.919]  If you go to Twitter and do hashtag vaccine damage, you will get thousands of links in just the last week to people in their own testimonials in the hospital or at funerals with the dead and dying, particularly children and young adults and teenagers and athletes.
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.302]  We're talking nurses and doctors dropping dead.
[00:09:06.022 --> 00:09:10.226]  In one hospital, they had four doctors die after the shot.
[00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.791]  This is insane how obvious this is.
[00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:21.355]  That's all coming up as well and the incredible admissions of all of this.
[00:09:23.156 --> 00:09:30.340]  College basketball star Derek Gray dead at 20 after the shot collapsed with a giant heart attack on the basketball court.
[00:09:32.261 --> 00:09:35.183]  That's all coming up today.
[00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:45.304]   The Chinese are openly threatening to shoot down Pelosi's plane if she Those on her visit to Taiwan.
[00:09:48.166 --> 00:09:50.427]  We just have so much we're going to be hitting here.
[00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:55.571]  This emergency Saturday broadcast, every day we're on air, is so important.
[00:09:56.111 --> 00:10:12.801]  So I want to encourage all of you watching on the live streams and later, this is archived after we're not live in three hours, to take the archive, take the live feed now and share it on your email, your text message, on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, everywhere you can before it's too late.
[00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:23.483]  I remember about a year after Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement came out, we made a piece called Endgame 2.0.
[00:10:27.605 --> 00:10:35.168]  And for some reason, we can't find it in our computers, and it was erased from our YouTube channel, so it's gone.
[00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:38.750]  It was an hour-long special with Dr. Michael Kaufman.
[00:10:40.455 --> 00:10:53.338]  With UN documents on their plan to break up the family, promote homosexuality, transgenderism from the 60s and 70s, and he had gone to the UN archives and gotten the documents, and I'm so frustrated that I can't find it.
[00:10:53.358 --> 00:11:04.141]  Well, I tried again this morning for an hour of searching at my desktop on every known search engine I could, and I could not find it anywhere.
[00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:04.861]  They're blocking it.
[00:11:05.922 --> 00:11:10.371]   And again, because the film was made Made Endgame 2007, made Endgame 2.0.
[00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:14.113]  It was just a free thing we put out online in 2008.
[00:11:14.933 --> 00:11:17.974]  So because that was 14 years ago, we can't find it.
[00:11:20.355 --> 00:11:31.841]  But I did find two minifilms that we made that were addendums to Endgame that I'd forgotten we made that are very hard to find.
[00:11:33.115 --> 00:11:34.916]  They've been expunging and taking down everywhere.
[00:11:34.996 --> 00:11:43.899]  So, after I'm live for about an hour and a half today, we're going to air these pieces for posterity that are so important.
[00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:50.141]  If you think endgame predicted stuff, wait till you see these two pieces.
[00:11:51.321 --> 00:11:55.323]  There were other little addendums to endgame I made, both about 35 minutes long apiece.
[00:11:57.694 --> 00:12:01.581]  New World Order Blueprint of Mad Men Full Documentary, 39 minutes.
[00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:04.365]  Endgame 2019, Democracy of Genocide, 33 minutes.
[00:12:09.138 --> 00:12:12.540]  We're going to air both those for our millions of viewers and listeners.
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.280]  We hope you share it.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.060]  We hope you cut it up.
[00:12:14.461 --> 00:12:15.121]  We hope you clip it.
[00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:15.881]  We hope you get it out.
[00:12:16.242 --> 00:12:17.222]  All of this is free to air.
[00:12:18.022 --> 00:12:19.143]  No copyright.
[00:12:19.583 --> 00:12:20.204]  Just get it out.
[00:12:20.224 --> 00:12:28.668]  Because our people are so good as populist and conservatives and Christians, whether you be beautiful black or beautiful brown or beautiful white or beautiful pink.
[00:12:29.793 --> 00:12:31.254]  All our beautiful people got made.
[00:12:32.115 --> 00:12:33.596]  Folks are constantly sending emails.
[00:12:33.616 --> 00:12:35.257]  We see them every day, hundreds of them.
[00:12:35.517 --> 00:12:36.477]  Can I share this?
[00:12:36.557 --> 00:12:37.398]  Can I use this?
[00:12:37.458 --> 00:12:37.698]  Can I?
[00:12:38.239 --> 00:12:38.619]  Yes!
[00:12:39.299 --> 00:12:40.060]  In fact, you better!
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.401]  I'm begging you to.
[00:12:41.941 --> 00:12:57.051]  Not ordering you to, I'm asking you to take everything we've got and to ferret through 28 years of work that's out there and to get it out because people are really looking for the truth right now and the minds of the population are very fertile with all this tyranny that's taking place.
[00:12:57.091 --> 00:12:58.092]  So, yes!
[00:13:00.128 --> 00:13:01.049]  We get emails all the time.
[00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:03.310]  Can I put Infowars on my barn or my business?
[00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:04.971]  You don't need my permission.
[00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:07.832]  But yes, of course, please do it now.
[00:13:09.533 --> 00:13:16.037]  I had dinner last night with a couple of my Houston lawyers.
[00:13:17.518 --> 00:13:20.019]  And one of them had just gotten up here from Houston.
[00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:23.081]  And he said, look, I'm in the parking garage leaving work yesterday.
[00:13:23.661 --> 00:13:25.562]  And I'm going to get him to send it to me.
[00:13:25.582 --> 00:13:26.122]  I forgot to do it.
[00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.944]  Beautiful black lady with an Alex Jones was right shirt.
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.421]  And you know what I loved about the shirt?
[00:13:32.661 --> 00:13:38.765]  Not just her beautiful soul through her eyes I could see in the photo in the parking garage, but it was a shirt we didn't make.
[00:13:40.746 --> 00:13:42.067]  It was something somebody else made.
[00:13:42.287 --> 00:13:43.407]  People are making them everywhere.
[00:13:43.567 --> 00:13:44.108]  I love that.
[00:13:44.308 --> 00:13:49.170]  Because long after I'm gone, because I tend to keep fighting, but let me tell you, every day is a blessing.
[00:13:50.151 --> 00:13:55.474]  Long after I can no longer speak, whether they kill me or put me in prison, or God gives me more time, it's all up to God.
[00:13:57.952 --> 00:14:00.614]  I'm in some globalist firing squadron, some dungeon getting beaten to death.
[00:14:00.654 --> 00:14:01.414]  I'm not going to blame God.
[00:14:01.735 --> 00:14:02.335]  I asked for this.
[00:14:04.056 --> 00:14:05.057]  And I want to be Christ-like.
[00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:06.318]  I'm not Christ.
[00:14:06.358 --> 00:14:07.899]  I'm far from it, but I want to be Christ-like.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.521]  Christ is our example.
[00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:15.244]  I just want to know you're going to continue on with the important work we've done.
[00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:18.407]  And the other lawyer goes, yeah.
[00:14:20.428 --> 00:14:25.992]  Twice in the courthouse yesterday when he was there, because he was in Austin, people gave him fist bumps and said, Alex Jones is right.
[00:14:27.546 --> 00:14:31.069]  Including the Travis County deputies.
[00:14:31.089 --> 00:14:34.232]  I don't want to get them in trouble, but you're right.
[00:14:34.312 --> 00:14:35.233]  Sorry this is happening.
[00:14:35.633 --> 00:14:37.295]  Fish bumping almost all of them.
[00:14:37.935 --> 00:14:43.140]  But one little Antifa guy that's got a handlebar mustache that harasses our people when we come in.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:43.680]  And that's fine.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.761]  We feel sorry for him.
[00:14:44.781 --> 00:14:54.740]   We can see The weird, demonic look in his eye, but fist bumping, shaking hands with dozens and dozens of deputies.
[00:14:55.181 --> 00:14:56.041]  One guy doesn't like us.
[00:14:56.982 --> 00:15:00.485]  And the reason I raise that is we're winning hearts and minds, folks.
[00:15:02.887 --> 00:15:13.592]   And we've come so far together that this was all expected to happen, and I had so many people Because it's on every major TV station in the country.
[00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:15.253]  It's on all the major networks.
[00:15:15.333 --> 00:15:16.313]  It's being force-fed.
[00:15:17.734 --> 00:15:21.675]  Yesterday, I went to YouTube on my phone, and attacks on Alex Jones were at the top.
[00:15:21.715 --> 00:15:24.336]  And I said, well, maybe they got cookies on my phone.
[00:15:24.456 --> 00:15:25.436]  Maybe that's just my phone.
[00:15:25.476 --> 00:15:31.319]  So I went to a desktop that I hadn't used in months in my office.
[00:15:32.379 --> 00:15:33.159]  They had a lot of computers.
[00:15:33.459 --> 00:15:34.660]  And it was the top thing.
[00:15:35.845 --> 00:15:38.806]  So they are pushing this, trying to demonize independent media.
[00:15:38.826 --> 00:15:40.267]  They're misrepresenting what we said and did.
[00:15:40.747 --> 00:15:41.907]  They've already found us guilty.
[00:15:44.908 --> 00:15:45.508]  And they're scared.
[00:15:47.129 --> 00:15:51.350]  And they are doing everything they can to set this precedent, but it's not going to work.
[00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:54.171]  Because of you and what you're doing.
[00:15:54.672 --> 00:15:55.992]  So let's go ahead and talk about this.
[00:15:58.553 --> 00:16:01.674]  I could spend an hour on this, but I'm going to probably spend only 10 minutes on it.
[00:16:05.347 --> 00:16:10.911]  I told listeners a year ago we were in the red.
[00:16:12.692 --> 00:16:16.215]  And listeners came through and got us back into the black off and on.
[00:16:16.255 --> 00:16:20.818]  But it was kind of a where we'd be in the black, be in the red, be in the black, be in the red, if you look at the graph.
[00:16:22.459 --> 00:16:26.703]  And a lot of that is our fault because we didn't get other backup suppliers.
[00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:32.723]  When this lockdown happened, when the supply chain breakdown happened, finally we have gotten backups that are even better than what we had before.
[00:16:33.343 --> 00:16:36.205]  So we didn't even have the products that in the past you've bought that kept us on air.
[00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:49.831]  But the legal fees and the debanking and the deplatforming and the always having to work around the clock just to even be able to stay online distracted us from our work, which is what the enemy's plan was.
[00:16:52.472 --> 00:16:57.374]  And so I was sitting here with an outside accounting firm months ago.
[00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:02.467]  And they were like, you're basically insolvent, despite the huge donations.
[00:17:02.708 --> 00:17:03.648]  Thank God those came in.
[00:17:03.688 --> 00:17:05.729]  They barely put you close to the black.
[00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:15.773]  And with all these three trials coming up, they wanted to have two trials at once, one in Austin, one in Connecticut, starting now.
[00:17:15.793 --> 00:17:18.675]  We need to declare bankruptcy.
[00:17:20.235 --> 00:17:25.238]  Totally legitimate, real, just so that we can regroup.
[00:17:25.458 --> 00:17:28.279]  Chapter 11, not a total liquidation, but a reorganization.
[00:17:30.165 --> 00:17:37.670]  But we made the decision to go ahead and just tear the Band-Aid off and just go into this first kangaroo trial to show the world what was going on.
[00:17:39.631 --> 00:17:46.456]  And then once that was going, go ahead and do it so that it wouldn't be this fake idea that we're trying to dodge one of these false trials.
[00:17:48.397 --> 00:17:59.911]   You're not supposed to, under Texas law, in a regular trial or this fake thing where the judge ruled I was guilty, tell a jury up front About what you think the money is that should be paid.
[00:17:59.931 --> 00:18:00.892]  You're supposed to do it at the end.
[00:18:01.952 --> 00:18:09.653]  But up front on Monday, their lawyer... I guess it was Tuesday.
[00:18:09.733 --> 00:18:10.674]  Monday was jury selection.
[00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:23.056]  Tuesday, gave his hour and a half opening statement to the National News Carried, saying Jones has mercilessly stalked and tracked and attacked these people, which never said their names, never did any of that.
[00:18:23.196 --> 00:18:23.876]  Never said their names!
[00:18:24.116 --> 00:18:26.197]  Under state law, you can't sue somebody if you haven't said their name.
[00:18:26.817 --> 00:18:27.357]  Judge doesn't care.
[00:18:30.086 --> 00:18:32.528]  And we want $150 million.
[00:18:33.388 --> 00:18:34.629]  Well, I don't have $2 million.
[00:18:34.849 --> 00:18:38.892]  And other companies I have don't have money.
[00:18:39.873 --> 00:18:41.934]  And it's all a big lie.
[00:18:43.735 --> 00:18:54.563]  And so, not just the fact that we need to reorganize, but also sworn in federal court, our financials are going in.
[00:18:56.178 --> 00:19:02.181]  So the world will see that, and they can't keep lying and saying, I have hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:19:02.501 --> 00:19:04.302]  It'd be okay if I had hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:19:04.362 --> 00:19:06.364]  Boy, we could do a lot more good, but it's not true.
[00:19:07.844 --> 00:19:22.172]  But they want to put that false information, which they've been doing in the trial, to confuse the jury and tell them I made money off Sandy Hook, which they falsely tell them, and the judge won't let my lawyer talk.
[00:19:22.432 --> 00:19:23.633]  The other side can say whatever they want.
[00:19:26.638 --> 00:19:35.985]  And so that's the point we've gotten to is understanding, ladies and gentlemen, that if they gave us a $10 million judgment, it is unpayable.
[00:19:36.745 --> 00:19:42.950]  So $100 million, $150 million, $500 million, a billion, a trillion, it doesn't matter.
[00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.950]  And they know that.
[00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:49.875]  This is a message to the American people that your speech is gone and you can't question Jussie Smollett.
[00:19:50.695 --> 00:19:52.837]  You can't question WMDs.
[00:19:54.226 --> 00:19:56.747]  You can't question all these leftist false flags.
[00:19:57.087 --> 00:20:04.710]  You've got to sit there and take it, and if you don't, we're going to sue you in lawfare and these George Soros judges, and we're going to shut you down.
[00:20:05.611 --> 00:20:06.411]  That's all this is.
[00:20:07.452 --> 00:20:15.275]  Well, to answer to that, we're going to do more shows, and we're going to make more films, and we're going to launch more projects, because we're not going to lay down and die.
[00:20:17.995 --> 00:20:21.677]  But I tell you, I don't have the time to do it, but I did it last night and this morning.
[00:20:21.897 --> 00:20:31.121]  I read at least 40 articles, and I scanned over 100, but I read probably more than 40 in their entirety.
[00:20:31.741 --> 00:20:39.765]  And man, the stuff you read with no link, with no proof, is Jones made, he made $75 million in 2019.
[00:20:40.544 --> 00:20:44.104]  $75 million in 2019.
[00:20:44.104 --> 00:20:49.104]  We didn't grow $79 million with everything we've got.
[00:20:49.276 --> 00:20:50.417]  And see, we sell product.
[00:20:51.197 --> 00:20:52.378]  So in many cases, we're making 20%.
[00:20:53.479 --> 00:20:54.959]  Usually about 40% on a product.
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.741]  Better stuff, I mean, 50%, but food's like 20, 30%.
[00:21:00.103 --> 00:21:12.148]  So yeah, I looked it up that year, we sold over $10 million in food and we made $3 million, which then went in for the bandwidth and the crew and the legal and the satellite uplinks and all the things that go on.
[00:21:12.868 --> 00:21:17.490]  You read about newspapers that go under, little small town papers cost five, 10 million a year to run.
[00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.330]  Things are expensive in media.
[00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:23.032]  The licenses, the Getty images, we pay for it all.
[00:21:23.612 --> 00:21:26.233]  We do it, according to the book, we pay for closed captioning.
[00:21:27.861 --> 00:21:31.007]  Cost a couple hundred thousand dollars a year because we're on TV and satellite.
[00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:33.912]  People said, well, just get rid of that.
[00:21:35.354 --> 00:21:37.177]  We didn't have closed captioning on InfoWars.
[00:21:36.996 --> 00:21:41.156]  we've been sued in New York by a disabilities group.
[00:21:41.156 --> 00:21:47.595]  So that's where we are.
[00:21:47.813 --> 00:21:49.334]  And why do they put out these headlines?
[00:21:49.894 --> 00:21:54.797]  Jones made, Jones took home, Jones pocketed 70 plus million dollars.
[00:21:54.837 --> 00:21:55.997]  I'll show you here in a minute.
[00:21:56.277 --> 00:21:56.858]  They do that.
[00:21:56.898 --> 00:22:00.399]  So you see that you think, oh, they've got plenty of money.
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.301]  They don't need support.
[00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:06.142]  And it's a lie, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:07.663 --> 00:22:12.028]   But hey, You don't think I don't know how dangerous federal court is?
[00:22:12.068 --> 00:22:14.990]  You don't think I don't know how twisted the legal system is, both state and federal?
[00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:15.711]  I've already experienced it.
[00:22:16.731 --> 00:22:22.136]  But I can't sit there and have them claim I've got $50, $100 million, $200 million in the bank.
[00:22:24.838 --> 00:22:29.621]  When if you add all the money the company has and everything together, it's like $4 million.
[00:22:29.982 --> 00:22:33.645]  We need that for payroll and everything and to buy products in the future.
[00:22:33.705 --> 00:22:36.347]  That's almost nothing with a company this size.
[00:22:37.759 --> 00:22:40.801]  The money I have, the money of this company, is not even $4 million.
[00:22:41.722 --> 00:22:46.306]  We went into bankruptcy with less than a million dollars in free speech systems.
[00:22:47.747 --> 00:22:50.870]  That's vapor in an operation this size.
[00:22:53.051 --> 00:22:55.193]  I'm pulling in the gas station while the engine's going.
[00:22:55.233 --> 00:22:56.374]  Have you ever had that?
[00:22:56.394 --> 00:23:02.399]  I've had that happen twice where you're on E, you go, oh my gosh, I'm almost out of gas.
[00:23:02.419 --> 00:23:05.761]  You feel the car kind of sputter and there's a gas station right there and you pull in.
[00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:09.920]  The other times I've run out in the middle of nowhere like an idiot, why'd I look at the gas gauge?
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:22.066]  But, you know, twice in my life, almost a couple years ago, I'm driving along 60 miles an hour, all of a sudden, and I know then, floor it, because then that keeps it going, and then I barely glided in to the gas station.
[00:23:23.586 --> 00:23:23.867]  Barely.
[00:23:24.127 --> 00:23:30.170]  I actually lost control partway in the parking lot, hit the brakes, and kind of had to string the hose over like 15 feet and barely got it in.
[00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.931]  But that's what this is like.
[00:23:33.571 --> 00:23:36.333]  Coming in, wings on fire, landing on an aircraft carrier.
[00:23:37.646 --> 00:23:38.306]  And that's okay.
[00:23:38.326 --> 00:23:38.967]  I'm not a victim.
[00:23:39.047 --> 00:23:39.827]  I asked for this.
[00:23:40.147 --> 00:23:42.109]  I'm surprised they haven't killed me yet or put me in prison.
[00:23:42.449 --> 00:23:44.490]  This is just how they attack now.
[00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:54.835]  With attrition and lawsuits and the same way they've strangled small business out of existence and attacked the Midwest and the South and rural areas all over this great country.
[00:23:56.636 --> 00:23:57.877]  So I've known all this.
[00:23:59.458 --> 00:24:02.760]  And I've understood all this for a very, very, very, very long time.
[00:24:05.101 --> 00:24:06.622]  And all I got to do is leave it on the field.
[00:24:08.231 --> 00:24:15.017]  Yeah, we've declared, you know, they called it a fraud four months ago when I declared bankruptcy of four subcompanies.
[00:24:18.179 --> 00:24:20.401]  And the reason you do that is each new company needs to have its own deal.
[00:24:20.781 --> 00:24:25.145]  So we had InfoWars Health, that was the longevity stuff, still selling great products.
[00:24:26.846 --> 00:24:35.033]  And we had some of the oldest companies I had set up that were real companies, including the company that owns InfoWars.com.
[00:24:36.527 --> 00:24:41.610]  And so we said, well, let's put those into bankruptcy so we can show the judge our finances.
[00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:46.832]  Now, we don't have money for three trials coming up, and we even offered to have free speech systems pay.
[00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:54.836]  It was an agreement with that bankruptcy to try to pay settlements and just end these show trials, but actually show the court how much money we had.
[00:24:57.157 --> 00:24:59.018]  So we just said, here we are, open books.
[00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:03.501]  They dropped those four companies out, including InfoWars.com.
[00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:08.004]  Because they wanted their show trial.
[00:25:08.605 --> 00:25:10.625]  And they wanted to say, I had hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:25:10.905 --> 00:25:13.146]  They didn't want a federal judge digging through all this.
[00:25:13.166 --> 00:25:18.727]  Because you understand, we didn't just go into bankruptcy with those companies.
[00:25:18.787 --> 00:25:27.089]  We agreed to have free speech systems pay and indemnify and be the arbiter to take care of that agreement.
[00:25:30.319 --> 00:25:36.042]  So they spit InfoWars out and these other companies supposedly with prejudice so they can't come after him later, which is a great thing.
[00:25:36.463 --> 00:25:37.784]  InfoWars.com is safe.
[00:25:38.404 --> 00:25:41.826]  But these corrupt judges, who knows?
[00:25:42.707 --> 00:25:44.928]  So we went through that processes.
[00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:54.394]  And I'm sitting here literally maxed out, putting everything I've got.
[00:25:55.307 --> 00:25:57.589]  Into keeping my crew employed, everything happening.
[00:25:57.609 --> 00:26:02.933]  My own lawyers are like, my God, Jones, you got like a half million dollars in your bank account, private.
[00:26:02.953 --> 00:26:06.856]  You just, you just put, you know, a half million dollars in last week.
[00:26:06.896 --> 00:26:08.117]  Now you're gonna put the last year money in.
[00:26:08.137 --> 00:26:15.323]  And I'm like, yeah, I told everybody I'm all in, but you need to understand this is all in.
[00:26:18.424 --> 00:26:21.425]  They're coming after six-month-old babies with poison shots.
[00:26:21.886 --> 00:26:28.049]  I have stacks of articles of where little babies that take the shots are dying and having all sorts of horrible reactions.
[00:26:28.449 --> 00:26:37.493]  That's a lot bigger issue than me, a 48-year-old man who's had a blessed life and 28 years in the war and has been incredibly successful.
[00:26:37.653 --> 00:26:38.353]  I asked for this.
[00:26:38.453 --> 00:26:38.954]  I'm a man.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.283]  But unborn babies and six-month-old babies and year-old babies can't protect themselves.
[00:26:44.563 --> 00:26:45.564]  So let's get this straight.
[00:26:45.844 --> 00:26:49.606]  We're not supporting InfoWars because we care what happens to Alex Jones.
[00:26:51.628 --> 00:26:57.232]  We're supporting InfoWars, and I'm supporting this fight, and I'm all in because this is what I pledged to do.
[00:26:57.492 --> 00:27:03.676]  We're having an incredible effect, and the most important work we've ever done is happening right now.
[00:27:05.612 --> 00:27:12.277]  And I'll be damned to hell before at the most important part of the fight, I turn tail and run or roll over.
[00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:15.800]  You are my strength.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.761]  You are my will.
[00:27:17.421 --> 00:27:21.364]  You are my temporal ability to fight these people and I am yours.
[00:27:21.464 --> 00:27:22.765]  We are brothers and sisters together.
[00:27:23.486 --> 00:27:30.811]  God is what gives us the inclination and the spiritual decision, but we have to have the guts then to carry it out.
[00:27:32.753 --> 00:27:34.174]  Should I put my money where my mouth is?
[00:27:35.339 --> 00:27:36.599]  And the federal filings are there.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:44.342]  How much money's there, what's going on, how much money I've been paid, all that stuff, so they can't lie, but they don't care.
[00:27:45.122 --> 00:27:48.303]  CBS, local Connecticut papers, all of that, I can't even keep track of it.
[00:27:48.963 --> 00:27:54.685]  Headlines, Jones made 70, I'll show you, 70 plus million dollars in 2019.
[00:27:55.265 --> 00:27:59.786]  We didn't gross that in 2019, anywhere near it.
[00:28:00.486 --> 00:28:02.767]  We've never had that much gross money come in in a year.
[00:28:05.165 --> 00:28:05.766]  That's gross.
[00:28:06.766 --> 00:28:13.032]  You know, like if you own a restaurant and you're bringing $20,000 over the weekend, but your costs are $19,000, you know?
[00:28:13.853 --> 00:28:14.994]  That's how businesses work.
[00:28:15.074 --> 00:28:18.517]  And I use business to fund this revolution against the New World Order.
[00:28:18.577 --> 00:28:20.619]  So yeah, I fired the bat signal a lot, folks.
[00:28:21.039 --> 00:28:27.364]   And I told you, we've been in trouble for a while with the supply chain breakdowns and And the attacks and legal fees and all of it.
[00:28:27.804 --> 00:28:30.165]  But now is the most important work we've ever done.

[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.442]  It started shipping, technically, yesterday.
[00:29:13.522 --> 00:29:17.444]  And they are shipping on Saturday, so I guess technically it's shipping out today and then on Monday.
[00:29:18.424 --> 00:29:20.305]  But Alex's War at InfoWareStore.com.

[00:29:27.536 --> 00:29:30.238]  If you go to mfulworthstore.com, you see that banner?

[00:29:38.441 --> 00:29:39.822]  We're not backed by the New World Order.
[00:29:39.882 --> 00:29:42.323]  We're backed by patriots like you.
[00:29:43.844 --> 00:29:45.985]  So I want to get into the worldwide food cutoff.
[00:29:46.745 --> 00:29:50.807]  I want to get into all of this here in just a moment because it's so important.
[00:29:52.247 --> 00:29:53.667]  The latest transhumanist developments.
[00:29:53.707 --> 00:29:57.128]  But first, let me just show you some of these headlines.
[00:29:57.168 --> 00:29:57.988]  I mean, just go to Google.
[00:29:58.028 --> 00:29:58.888]  Type in Alex Jones.
[00:29:59.248 --> 00:30:00.528]  Thousands of articles.
[00:30:00.989 --> 00:30:02.629]  Thousands of TV stations.
[00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:04.929]  Every TV station in Austin is carrying it.
[00:30:05.349 --> 00:30:07.050]  And you can go to a random town.
[00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:08.290]  Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:11.230]  Or Tampa, Florida.
[00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:12.591]  Local news stations.
[00:30:12.631 --> 00:30:13.771]  And I'm at the top of the page.
[00:30:14.951 --> 00:30:16.191]  Alex Jones attacked kids.
[00:30:16.551 --> 00:30:17.892]  Alex Jones stalked families.
[00:30:17.972 --> 00:30:20.212]  Alex Jones... I didn't say the names!
[00:30:22.597 --> 00:30:27.358]  of Scarlett Lewis and Haslam until this trial.
[00:30:28.758 --> 00:30:32.799]  Never said their names, just said, I think that shooting might have been staged, because so much has been staged.
[00:30:32.819 --> 00:30:34.820]  A lot of folks think Evaldi staged.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.980]  Now it's a crime to question that.
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:44.261]  And the judge says I'm guilty, so I'm sitting there in the courtroom while he's guilty, by the way, and he can't talk.
[00:30:44.902 --> 00:30:46.482]  I'm going to tell you, that man's guilty right there.
[00:30:49.142 --> 00:30:50.223]  You want to live in a world like that?
[00:30:50.263 --> 00:30:51.663]  You think you're safe in a world like that?
[00:30:53.539 --> 00:30:56.160]  InfoWars parent, Free Speech Systems.
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:57.620]  I named it right, didn't I?
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.801]  She banned the word free speech from the trial, but they have to keep saying it.
[00:31:01.241 --> 00:31:03.742]  Free Speech Systems files for bankruptcy.
[00:31:04.963 --> 00:31:10.184]  The company has liabilities of between $50 million and $100 million, and assets of $10 to $50 million.
[00:31:10.204 --> 00:31:11.685]  That's what they came up with the calculation.
[00:31:12.085 --> 00:31:14.866]  See, that's called being in the hole, according to a court filing.
[00:31:16.286 --> 00:31:18.247]  So Bloomberg actually got it right.
[00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:30.858]  And says the plaintiff's ambulance chaser lawyers won $150 million, which is almost 100 times the money I have.
[00:31:32.139 --> 00:31:34.121]  Okay, so you got that ridiculousness.
[00:31:34.982 --> 00:31:37.303]  By the way, it's all capped at a couple million bucks in Texas.
[00:31:37.844 --> 00:31:39.265]  They just want that number to scare people.
[00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:44.549]  Alex Jones' company files for bankruptcy amid Texas trial for damages to Sandy Hook families.
[00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:45.730]  CNN.
[00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:48.172]  And you read it here and it goes, yeah, judges found him guilty.
[00:31:48.532 --> 00:31:50.074]  They just say that like it's no big deal.
[00:31:50.154 --> 00:31:52.216]  Judges found him guilty.
[00:31:54.278 --> 00:31:56.980]  Texas media company files for bankruptcy amid defamation trial.
[00:31:58.542 --> 00:32:02.485]  Courts in Texas and Connecticut have already found Jones liable for defamation.
[00:32:02.545 --> 00:32:03.666]  Not juries, courts.
[00:32:04.507 --> 00:32:06.369]  For his portrayal of Sandy Hook massacres as a hoax.
[00:32:07.745 --> 00:32:09.407]  So CBS actually gets it right.
[00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:14.351]  But thousands of other publications, I've scanned over them, say, oh, he's already been found guilty.
[00:32:14.371 --> 00:32:15.232]  They don't tell you how.
[00:32:15.051 --> 00:32:18.651]   without trials because he failed to respond to court orders and turn over
[00:32:18.651 --> 00:32:24.381]  documents which didn't exist. So CBS actually gets it right.
[00:32:24.381 --> 00:32:28.331]   But thousands of other publications, I've scanned over them, say oh he's
[00:32:28.331 --> 00:32:31.881]   been already found guilty. They don't tell you how. They just hope people skip
[00:32:31.881 --> 00:32:38.971]   over that. Look at this one out of the Connecticut Insider.
[00:32:37.502 --> 00:32:38.783]  This is all over the Connecticut News.
[00:32:39.163 --> 00:32:42.326]  Alex Jones seeks bankruptcy protection for his parent company and sues it.
[00:32:43.087 --> 00:32:56.134]   Well, when a company is your main funding system, it's standard, like taking your car out of park before you drive, to then have the company indemnify you and you have to Make that claim in court.
[00:32:56.495 --> 00:32:58.035]  But they go, in a bizarre move.
[00:32:58.055 --> 00:33:01.517]  It's like, in a bizarre move, he put his shoes on before going to work.
[00:33:01.837 --> 00:33:04.618]  In a bizarre move, he wiped his ass after he took a crap.
[00:33:05.919 --> 00:33:07.760]  In a bizarre move, they gave the baby milk.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.141]  In a bizarre move, they fed the dog.
[00:33:10.441 --> 00:33:12.342]  In a bizarre move, they cut the grass.
[00:33:12.642 --> 00:33:14.843]  In a bizarre move, they looked at the sky.
[00:33:15.343 --> 00:33:17.724]  In a bizarre move, they ate their dinner.
[00:33:18.664 --> 00:33:19.985]  It's all bizarre, what we do.
[00:33:20.205 --> 00:33:21.986]  We're those bad Americans.
[00:33:23.308 --> 00:33:35.712]  And it goes on in here with no evidence and no links and no nothing to say Jones himself made 76 million in 2019.
[00:33:39.194 --> 00:33:41.634]  And that was told to the jury by them this week.
[00:33:42.875 --> 00:33:43.455]  By their lawyers.
[00:33:44.315 --> 00:33:45.576]  We can't talk, basically.
[00:33:45.936 --> 00:33:49.317]  And they just made that number up to make the jury think, I'm Daddy Warbucks.
[00:33:49.697 --> 00:33:51.498]  This is unbelievable.
[00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:55.430]  And it goes on.
[00:33:57.572 --> 00:33:58.532]  It goes on from there.
[00:34:00.693 --> 00:34:02.114]  So I'm done talking about that.
[00:34:03.315 --> 00:34:04.315]  Here's some of the comments.
[00:34:04.776 --> 00:34:07.297]  A juror question from Alex Jones trial today.
[00:34:07.717 --> 00:34:12.740]  Can we use lawsuits like those to stop election deniers that they're giving questions to the witnesses?
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:13.440]  Yeah.
[00:34:14.461 --> 00:34:16.962]  Can we stop denying in elections a fraud?
[00:34:17.362 --> 00:34:23.686]  Whether you're right or wrong about an election, you have a right to do it, but that's where this is all going.
[00:34:25.663 --> 00:34:26.543]  So here's what I'm going to do.
[00:34:27.984 --> 00:34:29.105]  I'm going to air three clips.
[00:34:29.285 --> 00:34:34.908]  I'm going to go to a John Bowne report that tees up the world currency and the collapse of the system to bring it in.
[00:34:34.968 --> 00:34:39.170]  I'm going to get the really important news here today, but I want to thank you all for joining us.
[00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:43.572]  But I'm going to air clip one, six, and three back to back.
[00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:48.575]  One is the Lincoln Project, the disgraced Lincoln Project.
[00:34:48.995 --> 00:34:49.775]  You know why, right?
[00:34:50.355 --> 00:34:51.676]  Could be called the pedo project.
[00:34:53.057 --> 00:34:55.038]  Democrat Party operation opposing Republicans.
[00:34:55.968 --> 00:35:00.190]  Attacking me and saying I'm crazy, that I want access to the courts.
[00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:03.072]  Just because I say one court's corrupt, I've got to fight in those courts.
[00:35:03.392 --> 00:35:07.534]  If I then go file things in court, doesn't mean I'm now part of the corrupt court.
[00:35:07.834 --> 00:35:08.894]  I'm fighting in the court.
[00:35:09.135 --> 00:35:09.955]  I've been drug into the court.
[00:35:10.235 --> 00:35:11.736]  All these are logical fallacies.
[00:35:13.831 --> 00:35:20.593]  So here's this disgraced corporate media, with a disgraced organization, up there acting like I've done something bad.
[00:35:20.833 --> 00:35:32.557]  He then goes on to say, I'm insane, there's no nanotech in the vaccines, there's no nanotech in the food, when the FDA a year and a half ago said we have no jurisdiction, and now nanotech's being put in a lot of the food, that's mainline news.
[00:35:32.817 --> 00:35:37.499]  Type in FDA nanotech sprayed on food.
[00:35:37.599 --> 00:35:38.719]  It's on their website.
[00:35:40.657 --> 00:35:44.799]  Type in nanoplastics now found in all humans in the Western world.
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:49.822]  Type in glyphosate causing cancer, but they deny it and they deny the name.
[00:35:49.982 --> 00:35:54.284]  These are sick people who are mercenaries who just put out their talking points.
[00:35:55.765 --> 00:36:04.570]  Then I want to go to a blast from the past, Senator Frank Church hearings in the 70s about the CIA and Operation Mockingbird.
[00:36:06.374 --> 00:36:14.960]  And that was going back to World War II, the OSS and CIA after controlling the corporate press just to show you what's really going on.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.462]  So we're going to play those three clips back to back.
[00:36:19.443 --> 00:36:22.946]  And then we're going to play John Bowne's latest report.
[00:36:23.046 --> 00:36:26.929]  We are on the verge of a new world of currency because that is the breaking news we have.
[00:36:26.989 --> 00:36:29.731]  But again, I'm going to say this very slowly and very clearly.
[00:36:30.933 --> 00:36:31.814]  This is a dummy book.
[00:36:31.834 --> 00:36:32.554]  They've been printed.
[00:36:33.075 --> 00:36:33.695]  One is in the mail.
[00:36:33.755 --> 00:36:34.936]  I'm told it'll be here Monday.
[00:36:35.416 --> 00:36:37.498]  They just put the cover on another book, similar size.
[00:36:37.878 --> 00:36:41.661]  We have this, but where I show you all the graphics and documents and how amazing it is.
[00:36:42.041 --> 00:36:46.585]  But the book coming in, that is, The Great Reset and the War for the World, Alex Jones.
[00:36:47.986 --> 00:36:50.528]  This is the equivalent of the Death Star blueprints.
[00:36:52.056 --> 00:36:53.457]  This is how you defeat them.
[00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:55.459]  This is how you destroy them.
[00:36:55.779 --> 00:37:01.845]  It's their own admitted plan, their own battle game, the new authoritarianism we face, the transhumanism.
[00:37:02.446 --> 00:37:06.710]  This is the best book on the best-selling subject.
[00:37:07.708 --> 00:37:13.451]  They approached me from Skyhorse a year ago, and they said, will you write a great reset book over a year ago?
[00:37:13.891 --> 00:37:14.932]  And I said, listen, I'm too busy.
[00:37:14.972 --> 00:37:16.793]  I can put out videos that were just as many.
[00:37:16.953 --> 00:37:18.674]  They said, yeah, but it's prestigious.
[00:37:18.694 --> 00:37:19.614]  People respect books.
[00:37:20.054 --> 00:37:20.935]  We think it'll go to number one.
[00:37:20.955 --> 00:37:24.737]  We've already had several number one great reset books, which they did.
[00:37:25.937 --> 00:37:27.038]  And I said, fine, I'll do it.
[00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:44.729]   So I started doing the research, wrote up the chapters, got all these files together and video clips, started working about Six months ago, I called a ghostwriter, but just a great lawyer who's a compiler, who fact-checked everything we were saying and doing, and he gets credit in the book.
[00:37:45.809 --> 00:37:47.170]  So we'll talk about that once it comes out.
[00:37:47.811 --> 00:37:52.735]  But they checked everything I said, and then he found even worse stuff, and he contributed a lot to the book.
[00:37:53.335 --> 00:37:57.358]  And that's why Steve Bannon said, the lawyer's written a bunch of books.
[00:37:57.378 --> 00:37:58.199]  He's a well-known lawyer, actually.
[00:37:58.219 --> 00:37:59.720]  I'm not going to say his name to let the books out.
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:03.483]  But the point is, is that this is the Death Star plans.
[00:38:05.438 --> 00:38:06.920]  He used a cheesy Star Wars analogy.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.302]  We don't need a battle of Yavin to get this.
[00:38:10.043 --> 00:38:11.645]  We have the damn plan.
[00:38:12.306 --> 00:38:14.068]  And this really, you could say, is my masterwork.
[00:38:14.548 --> 00:38:22.777]  Steve Bannon read it and he said, and Steve never does this, he said, this is the most important intellectual work since the founding fathers.
[00:38:24.139 --> 00:38:24.700]  And it really is.
[00:38:26.476 --> 00:38:28.778]  Because we actually got all their quotes and all their admissions.
[00:38:29.018 --> 00:38:29.539]  It's them.
[00:38:29.559 --> 00:38:31.781]  I mean, it's a damn nightmare, okay?
[00:38:32.141 --> 00:38:33.422]  I mean, you read this.
[00:38:33.863 --> 00:38:35.304]  I got very depressed writing this book.
[00:38:37.786 --> 00:38:47.776]  Because I thought I knew about the Great Reset, the New World Order, and I spent months, everyday hours, digging through and then trying to figure out how to condense it.
[00:38:48.776 --> 00:38:50.258]  Because it could have been a thousand pages long.
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.461]  It's on pre-order at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:38:54.761 --> 00:38:58.242]  You also get a signed copy and we need the money, but I'm going to sign every damn one of them.
[00:38:58.662 --> 00:39:01.163]  So I'm going to be up here for a long time.
[00:39:01.423 --> 00:39:02.623]  The books start coming in next week.
[00:39:02.943 --> 00:39:04.563]  They don't ship out till later in August.
[00:39:05.944 --> 00:39:08.085]  Get your great reset at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:39:08.165 --> 00:39:13.786]  And then separately, when we come back, we need to show this too, because I don't, I'm not invested in the film.
[00:39:13.826 --> 00:39:16.427]  I don't make money off the film other than the DVDs of it we sell.
[00:39:18.129 --> 00:39:21.474]  Alex's war brought tears to my eyes and it really is fair.
[00:39:21.634 --> 00:39:24.358]  And it shows what a maniac I am and sometimes I act like a fool.
[00:39:26.381 --> 00:39:30.787]  But it shows the beautiful things we've done and all the great people we've worked with and it brought tears to my eyes.
[00:39:31.147 --> 00:39:32.289]  People are blown away by it.
[00:39:33.695 --> 00:39:38.922]  He does have that graphic actually in the computer of where it's showing in theaters around the country.
[00:39:39.403 --> 00:39:43.228]  But the best thing to do is just go to Alex's War with an S on the end.
[00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:45.572]  Alex'swar.com.
[00:39:46.193 --> 00:39:47.374]  Yeah, that's an earlier list.
[00:39:47.715 --> 00:39:48.516]  There's a bigger one now.
[00:39:49.597 --> 00:39:55.041]  But the point is, is that it is showing in more than, what, 10 states right now.
[00:39:55.061 --> 00:39:58.523]  It's showing in Austin, Texas as well.
[00:39:59.103 --> 00:40:00.865]  And it's very important to sell that out.
[00:40:01.245 --> 00:40:02.766]  Then the theaters will book it more.
[00:40:03.106 --> 00:40:05.988]  But right now it's one showing per day in a bunch of towns.
[00:40:06.008 --> 00:40:09.651]  And I'm told it's sold out most places, but in a few small towns it hasn't.
[00:40:10.011 --> 00:40:10.891]  We appreciate those.
[00:40:11.992 --> 00:40:13.472]  Groups and theaters that have done this.
[00:40:14.032 --> 00:40:19.594]  We want to reach out to all of the theater owners around the country to contact alexiswar.com.
[00:40:20.254 --> 00:40:26.215]  And this small band of great folks is working very, very hard to make sure you can get it for your theater as well.
[00:40:26.255 --> 00:40:28.075]  But this is a culture war.
[00:40:28.515 --> 00:40:35.717]  The Great Reset is number one now on more than 20 charts, including history and world history ahead of Obama, Yuval Harari, and many others.
[00:40:36.677 --> 00:40:41.638]  And yes, we do get funds from the great reset sales coming up in a few months.
[00:40:42.018 --> 00:40:46.639]  We get instant sales at InfoWarshaw.com, but I kind of want you to go to Amazon and get it.
[00:40:46.979 --> 00:40:48.339]  I want to push it to number one.
[00:40:48.359 --> 00:40:51.640]  It's like number 40-something in the world as of Friday.
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:52.140]  It was number 50.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.361]  I haven't checked that today.
[00:40:54.381 --> 00:40:56.441]  All right, I'm going to stop right there.
[00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:58.841]  This is a total culture war, and I appreciate you all.
[00:40:59.602 --> 00:41:01.022]  It's just an amazing time to be alive.
[00:41:03.854 --> 00:41:06.911]  Here is the Lincoln Project on the failed MSNBC.
[00:41:08.291 --> 00:41:09.652]  Lying about me and demonizing me.
[00:41:09.932 --> 00:41:11.173]  You can check anything we say.
[00:41:11.473 --> 00:41:13.214]  It's right there for you to see.
[00:41:13.995 --> 00:41:17.057]  Microplastics, nanotech, the damn shots for nanotech.
[00:41:17.297 --> 00:41:17.938]  It's all coming out.
[00:41:17.958 --> 00:41:18.998]  They're colonizing us with it.
[00:41:19.799 --> 00:41:26.283]  And then, as I said, a little brief statement I made that really explains that over until I got sued the first six years at Sandy Hook, we barely talked about it.
[00:41:26.643 --> 00:41:27.344]  I thought it happened.
[00:41:27.364 --> 00:41:29.505]  I thought they might have actually killed a bunch of kids in a false flag.
[00:41:29.545 --> 00:41:30.086]  Wasn't sure.
[00:41:30.666 --> 00:41:32.327]  Adam Lanza was tied to the CIA.
[00:41:32.767 --> 00:41:34.849]  All the rest of it, that came out in the news.
[00:41:36.371 --> 00:41:38.552]  And, you know, all the ways he got the guns, the rest of it.
[00:41:39.052 --> 00:41:40.452]  Then I kind of thought, okay, maybe folks are right.
[00:41:40.472 --> 00:41:42.793]  Maybe it was a totally staged deal, because that happens sometimes.
[00:41:43.533 --> 00:41:45.254]  And then I thought, nah, it probably happened.
[00:41:46.474 --> 00:41:47.315]  And then they sued me.
[00:41:48.615 --> 00:41:50.656]  And then they defaulted me because I couldn't have a real trial.
[00:41:51.556 --> 00:41:54.237]  And then now they want $150 million that doesn't exist.
[00:41:54.617 --> 00:41:59.338]  And then we'll end with the CIA and its manipulation of media, just so folks know that really happens.
[00:41:59.358 --> 00:42:01.139]  Then John Bowne's report, and then I'm coming back.
[00:42:02.796 --> 00:42:10.242]  With incredible information on the COVID attack, the mass deaths that are taking place, and so much more on this live Sunday broadcast.
[00:42:10.302 --> 00:42:12.684]  And then, couldn't find Endgame 2.0.
[00:42:12.884 --> 00:42:14.465]  Man, somebody's got to find that.
[00:42:14.605 --> 00:42:14.985]  So good.
[00:42:15.526 --> 00:42:16.046]  So informative.
[00:42:16.066 --> 00:42:17.327]  Well, it's just their documents.
[00:42:18.228 --> 00:42:27.015]  But we did find two other derivatives of Endgame that have gotten no attention in years and years, probably a decade, that we're going to put back out in the public consciousness tonight.
[00:42:27.995 --> 00:42:28.736]  So stay with us.
[00:42:30.413 --> 00:42:31.613]  Well, I think it's interesting.
[00:42:31.673 --> 00:42:42.477]  Remember that years ago, Alex Jones lost a custody case with his wife over their children because she said, we can't raise our kids around someone like this.
[00:42:42.537 --> 00:42:44.218]  And his defense was, it's all an act.
[00:42:45.058 --> 00:42:49.860]  Right now, with the kids from Sandy Hook and their parents... You know, hit pause.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.340]  Hit pause.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.820]  Back at the beginning of this, guys.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:56.122]  See, I'm going to play these clips and then, you know, take a break, log over the news and come back with it.
[00:42:58.376 --> 00:43:03.198]  I offered a million dollar award of a video where I say I'm an actor and it's all fake.
[00:43:04.019 --> 00:43:04.519]  That's not true.
[00:43:07.481 --> 00:43:15.364]  And I'm not going to go back over this, but in my custody battle, my ex-wife for my children, where he says I lost the children, really?
[00:43:15.585 --> 00:43:15.845]  I did?
[00:43:15.865 --> 00:43:18.326]  That's why they live with me?
[00:43:20.487 --> 00:43:22.308]  Now they've moved, grown up and moved out?
[00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:24.169]  None of it's true.
[00:43:28.942 --> 00:43:32.369]  She wanted to show a clip of me as the Joker and said, he's insane.
[00:43:32.389 --> 00:43:33.491]  He's telling kids to use drugs.
[00:43:33.832 --> 00:43:34.854]  It was reverse psychology.
[00:43:34.934 --> 00:43:35.435]  I'm a Joker.
[00:43:35.455 --> 00:43:36.097]  I want you to die.
[00:43:36.397 --> 00:43:37.239]  Take drugs, kids.
[00:43:38.582 --> 00:43:40.386]  Anti-drug, anti-fluoride PSA.
[00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:43.431]  And my lawyer said that's him being an actor.
[00:43:43.471 --> 00:43:45.593]  He doesn't mean that when he's saying it's satire.
[00:43:45.813 --> 00:43:47.354]  Not that everything I do is satire.
[00:43:47.554 --> 00:43:55.039]  But again, these are these little decepticons that just reinforce the same lies and beat us over the head with them over and over and over.
[00:43:55.139 --> 00:43:56.100]  You don't get a jury.
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:57.461]  You don't get free speech.
[00:43:57.801 --> 00:43:58.462]  You're an actor.
[00:43:58.502 --> 00:43:58.962]  You're fake.
[00:43:59.022 --> 00:44:01.764]  No, you're fake reading off a list of garbage.
[00:44:02.144 --> 00:44:03.085]  Sorry, I'm going to stop now.
[00:44:03.945 --> 00:44:04.726]  Let's play it back to back.
[00:44:05.908 --> 00:44:09.593]  He's saying, well, he's already put his organization into bankruptcy to protect it.
[00:44:10.013 --> 00:44:16.541]  And Ari, what I think is interesting, whether or not it's Alex Jones or so many of these people around January 6th that we've seen... Well, I'll stop right there, guys.
[00:44:16.981 --> 00:44:18.143]  I want to back it up to the beginning.
[00:44:19.104 --> 00:44:20.225]  I don't want to interrupt it, okay?
[00:44:21.327 --> 00:44:22.869]  Now we're going to play it from the beginning.
[00:44:23.509 --> 00:44:23.850]  Here it is.
[00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:26.311]  Well, I think it's interesting.
[00:44:26.351 --> 00:44:37.170]  Remember that years ago, Alex Jones lost a custody case with his wife over their children because she said, we can't raise our kids around someone like this.
[00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:38.853]  And his defense was it's all an act.
[00:44:39.725 --> 00:44:47.830]  Right now with the kids from Sandy Hook and their parents, he's saying, well, he's already put his organization into bankruptcy to protect it.
[00:44:48.231 --> 00:44:59.838]  And Ari, what I think is interesting, whether or not it's Alex Jones or so many of these people around January 6th that we've seen take the Fifth Amendment, which is they have no respect or regard for human decency or the law.
[00:45:00.218 --> 00:45:07.583]  But when they are suddenly in the target of American jurisprudence, they hide behind the very Constitution that so many of them disdain.
[00:45:10.086 --> 00:45:10.466]  Well put.
[00:45:10.787 --> 00:45:13.830]  What is Alex Jones' position, in your view, in today's Republican Party?
[00:45:16.132 --> 00:45:30.188]   I think he is right up there with the Steve Bannon's and the Tucker Carlson's of the world, which is he provides a safe place for otherwise, as you said, incredibly Destructive, strange, weird, you know, theories.
[00:45:30.208 --> 00:45:34.070]  I was watching a little clip of him today, Ari, and I wouldn't recommend that for your mental health.
[00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:37.571]  But, you know, there's a giant dragon waiting to eat all of us.
[00:45:37.951 --> 00:45:40.592]  We've already had the nanotechnology implanted in us.
[00:45:40.932 --> 00:45:42.073]  They're all ready to kill us.
[00:45:42.173 --> 00:45:44.854]  I mean, this stuff, it boggles the mind.
[00:45:44.894 --> 00:45:52.976]   I mean, you know, charlatan and clown doesn't begin to say it, but he has the voice that speaks to millions of people and it's not just the
[00:45:52.976 --> 00:45:57.135]   folks that watch him on YouTube, which I think he's been banned from, but also his clips get
[00:45:57.135 --> 00:46:00.936]   pushed around and they further these conspiracy theories.
[00:46:00.936 --> 00:46:06.635]   And I was just watching your last segment where Jay-Z says that information doesn't
[00:46:06.635 --> 00:46:08.115]  equal knowledge or wisdom.
[00:46:08.115 --> 00:46:12.076]   And I think that's the truth, which is folks are taking in information.
[00:46:12.076 --> 00:46:13.635]  It doesn't matter whether or not it's true.
[00:46:13.639 --> 00:46:14.559]  You can hold your iPhone.
[00:46:14.579 --> 00:46:18.561]  It's got every last bit of human knowledge that's ever been invented within it.
[00:46:18.861 --> 00:46:24.381]   And yet we have people that believe the same sort of superstitions as they did in the 1500s and 1600s.
[00:46:24.381 --> 00:46:38.060]   I've been saying I believe Sandy Hook happened for six years.
[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:46.303]  What they did was put out edited tapes where I would say some people believe Sandy Hook is totally fake and absolutely synthetic.
[00:46:46.823 --> 00:46:48.684]  I've questioned it, but now I think it happened.
[00:46:49.464 --> 00:46:55.687]  So for the first two years I thought it happened, then I questioned it, then I said I believed it happened long before they sued me.
[00:46:56.087 --> 00:47:01.369]  But they would edit tapes out to then have me questioning it to say I was denying it.
[00:47:01.869 --> 00:47:06.347]   I never said The plaintiff's names until this week.
[00:47:07.208 --> 00:47:09.832]  Under Texas law, you can't sue somebody unless you've said their name.
[00:47:10.252 --> 00:47:12.415]  But this judge didn't care and just waved that through.
[00:47:13.076 --> 00:47:18.864]  So, they're trying to keep the full videos out of what I actually said and now we're airing the videos from six...
[00:47:19.505 --> 00:47:22.864]   years ago and five years ago and three years ago and me saying I thought it happened.
[00:47:22.864 --> 00:47:27.985]   Before they sued me, I said I believe Sandy Hook happened, but anybody has a right to question
[00:47:27.985 --> 00:47:33.264]   events because sometimes we get lied to. And they have fought to try to keep those tapes out because
[00:47:33.264 --> 00:47:37.505]   they want to misrepresent things in the jury. But regardless, the judge said I don't have a
[00:47:37.505 --> 00:47:42.064]   right to a jury and she found me guilty, claiming I didn't provide enough discovery.
[00:47:42.306 --> 00:47:45.669]  We gave them hundreds of thousands of documents, all the videos, everything.
[00:47:45.989 --> 00:47:50.814]  And they claimed, no, that's not enough, you're hiding something, and defaulted me, and the judge found me guilty.
[00:47:51.134 --> 00:47:53.996]  In America, judges don't find you guilty, juries do.
[00:47:54.296 --> 00:47:58.200]  So who's on really trial here is the out-of-control, weaponized judiciary.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:47:59.321]  Thank you.
[00:47:59.701 --> 00:48:00.442]  Thank you very much.
[00:48:00.542 --> 00:48:10.363]   I thought that it was a matter of real concern that planted stories intended to serve a national purpose
[00:48:10.363 --> 00:48:20.043]   abroad came home and were circulated here and believed here
[00:48:20.043 --> 00:48:28.643]   because this would mean that the CIA could manipulate the news in the United States
[00:48:28.643 --> 00:48:31.042]  by channeling it through some foreign country.
[00:48:31.042 --> 00:48:33.443]  Now we're looking at that very carefully.
[00:48:33.443 --> 00:48:48.413]   Do you have any people being paid by the CIA who are contributing to a major circulation American
[00:48:48.413 --> 00:48:49.643]  journal?
[00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:54.174]  We do have people who submit pieces to other, to American journals.
[00:48:54.355 --> 00:49:08.005]   Do you have any people paid by the CIA who are working for Television networks.
[00:49:10.946 --> 00:49:17.367]  This, I think, gets into the kind of, uh, getting into the details, Mr. Chairman, that I'd like to get into an executive session.
[00:49:18.608 --> 00:49:24.269]  Uh, at CBS, uh, we, uh, had been contacted by the CIA.
[00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:34.051]  As a matter of fact, by the time I became the head of the whole news and public affairs operation in 1954, ships had been established, and I was told about them and asked if I'd carry on with them.
[00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:37.566]   We have Quite a lot of detailed information.
[00:49:39.226 --> 00:49:56.611]  And we will evaluate it and we will include any evidence of wrongdoing or any evidence of impropriety in our final report and make recommendations.
[00:49:57.432 --> 00:50:16.422]   Do you have any people being paid by the CIA Who are contributing to the National News Services, AP and UPI.
[00:50:18.105 --> 00:50:20.008]  Well again, I think we're getting into the kind of...
[00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:34.560]  Recently, the central bank digital currencies have been the talking point at the global confabs because they lead to the creation of a global currency system.
[00:50:34.841 --> 00:50:41.127]  Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to the session on resetting digital currencies.
[00:50:41.607 --> 00:50:46.532]  The theme of this year's forum, as you know, is a crucial year to rebuild trust.
[00:50:46.832 --> 00:50:52.631]   The digital payment system can help reduce these logistical costs, can help remove the
[00:50:52.631 --> 00:50:55.312]  dangers of holding cash.
[00:50:55.312 --> 00:51:02.351]   As the architects of multiple global crises pour on the tyranny, the IMF is enjoying an
[00:51:02.351 --> 00:51:08.932]   elevated position as the problem solver most nations turn to for help, racketeering on
[00:51:08.932 --> 00:51:10.432]  a global scale.
[00:51:10.432 --> 00:51:17.152]   With all the current issues on our agenda, we tend to forget that we are in the midst
[00:51:17.152 --> 00:51:19.631]  of the fourth industrial revolution.
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:28.524]  which accelerates global change in much more comprehensive and faster ways than the previous three revolutions.
[00:51:29.305 --> 00:51:34.588]  The objective is to quickly recognize the potential of new technologies.
[00:51:34.948 --> 00:51:38.870]  History is truly at a turning point.
[00:51:39.451 --> 00:51:46.395]  We do not yet know the full extent and the systemic and structural changes which will happen.
[00:51:47.695 --> 00:51:56.973]   However, We do know that global energy systems, food systems and supply chains will be deeply affected.
[00:51:57.674 --> 00:52:12.608]  And as Bloomberg gleefully reported, key Democratic congressional allies are urging President Joe Biden's administration to support a new injection of resources for countries at the IMF to help them deal with the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
[00:52:12.708 --> 00:52:24.553]  To the tune of at least $650 billion in additional IMF reserve assets, the demand is being led by Representative Pramila Jayapal and Senator Elizabeth Warren.
[00:52:24.773 --> 00:52:36.857]  Zero Hedge recently put the puzzle pieces together concerning the Democrats' proposed $650 billion flooding of the IMF with special drawing right funds.
[00:52:37.318 --> 00:52:39.799]  What are special drawing right funds?
[00:52:41.019 --> 00:52:49.912]  The Special Drawing Rights, or SDR, was created by the IMF in 1969 to supplement the official reserves of its member countries.
[00:52:51.249 --> 00:53:02.178]  The SDR is an interest-bearing international reserve asset that can only be held by the IMF, its member countries, and designated official entities known as prescribed holders.
[00:53:03.059 --> 00:53:10.185]  In addition to this role, the SDR serves as the unit of account of the IMF and several other international organizations.
[00:53:10.565 --> 00:53:15.629]  Zero Hedge writes, each new crisis brings global banks closer to their goal.
[00:53:15.889 --> 00:53:24.735]   The introduction of national digital currencies and the SDR basket Become the de facto reserve trading tool for the world.
[00:53:24.975 --> 00:53:29.997]  Why do Democrats specifically want aid denominated in SDRs?
[00:53:30.337 --> 00:53:33.218]  Because funding allocations in the U.S.
[00:53:33.479 --> 00:53:38.541]  have already hit their maximum and new funding bills are being defeated in the Senate.
[00:53:38.801 --> 00:53:41.962]  At the IMF, there are no checks and balances.
[00:53:42.302 --> 00:53:48.765]  They can ask for almost any amount of money in the form of SDRs without oversight.
[00:53:49.085 --> 00:53:59.173]  There are always strings attached when it comes to the IMF, and in exchange for SDRs, the globalists will certainly want more centralized control.
[00:53:59.413 --> 00:54:03.056]  The Ukrainian war is not merely a money laundering operation.
[00:54:03.356 --> 00:54:13.344]  It is a linchpin to transfer the global economy out of the money printing of central banks, and directly into the hands of globalists controlling the IMF.
[00:54:13.644 --> 00:54:19.809]  We are being looted in real time of our property, currency, sovereignty, and our very lives.
[00:54:20.329 --> 00:54:21.470]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:28.042]  Very important John Bowne report at BAN.VIDEO.
[00:54:28.123 --> 00:54:29.944]  Can't find this information anywhere else.
[00:54:30.084 --> 00:54:32.066]  Only way it gets out is you share it.
[00:54:32.466 --> 00:54:33.147]  We put it together.
[00:54:33.187 --> 00:54:33.827]  We do the research.
[00:54:33.867 --> 00:54:35.469]  We fight the globalists at point blank range.
[00:54:35.929 --> 00:54:42.114]  We go through the persecution and pain because we believe in you and we know that God is in control and we're going to win together.
[00:54:42.194 --> 00:54:44.176]  But if you don't take action, we are doomed.
[00:54:46.198 --> 00:54:46.458]  Okay.
[00:54:48.274 --> 00:54:52.236]  The first thing we air today was the new Gregory's Report that just came out a few hours ago.
[00:54:52.636 --> 00:54:55.437]  The environmentalist Trojan horse of the depopulation death cult.
[00:54:56.358 --> 00:54:58.579]  And that's exactly what this situation is.
[00:54:59.579 --> 00:55:02.501]  Now, all over the world they're announcing smart cities.
[00:55:03.461 --> 00:55:15.907]  That are basically walled areas where you're a prisoner, but you get a universal basic income if you agree to live in that area and submit to all the surveillance and controls.
[00:55:17.341 --> 00:55:21.283]  Everyone else is put under a form of siege economically where they can't operate.
[00:55:21.663 --> 00:55:25.885]  That's why they're attacking people that live on farms and now calling it racist everywhere.
[00:55:25.905 --> 00:55:27.286]  We try to get out of the big cities.
[00:55:27.886 --> 00:55:28.646]  What does that have to do with it?
[00:55:30.407 --> 00:55:31.328]  Here's a CNN report.
[00:55:32.332 --> 00:55:33.512]  Future or fantasy?
[00:55:33.572 --> 00:55:42.435]  Designs unveiled for one building city, structure 106 miles long in Saudi Arabia, similar to what the Dubai project has already set up.
[00:55:42.975 --> 00:55:55.119]  But if you look at it, instead of building a wall around groups, you put people in a wall that is actually a giant supermax prison and 250 square foot coffin apartments for the average person.
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:58.800]  This is the model of the future.
[00:55:59.661 --> 00:56:03.539]   High tech, Prison walled cities.
[00:56:04.579 --> 00:56:07.141]  Very important report from Zero Hedge.
[00:56:07.201 --> 00:56:09.242]  It's also linked up on Infowars.com.
[00:56:10.222 --> 00:56:14.044]  UN World Economic Forum behind global war on farmers say experts.
[00:56:14.644 --> 00:56:25.610]  And it goes over in 12 pages the links, the admissions, and the WEF admitting that now runs the UN officially that this is what they're doing, shutting down farmers.
[00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:27.511]  All over the world paying them to stop producing.
[00:56:28.211 --> 00:56:33.776]  Paying them to move off their land, banning them having cows, put the protester about the Netherlands and so many other places.
[00:56:33.836 --> 00:56:35.357]  This is the attack.
[00:56:35.877 --> 00:56:37.238]  You will eat the bugs, you will love it.
[00:56:37.699 --> 00:56:38.760]  Global food crisis.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:43.303]  Restaurant czar expects winter shortages, tells public to stock up now.
[00:56:43.704 --> 00:56:44.504]  That's from Breitbart.
[00:56:45.485 --> 00:56:52.290]  The head of a major food chain in Ireland has expressed concern that the country may face food shortages this coming winter.
[00:56:53.912 --> 00:56:55.353]  Telling the public they should stock up.
[00:56:55.453 --> 00:57:04.106]   Pat Madonna McDonald, the head of the local fast food chains, Supermax,
[00:57:04.106 --> 00:57:08.505]   has warned the public that Ireland may face food shortages over the coming winter,
[00:57:08.505 --> 00:57:14.105]   that individuals should be looking to stock up on non-perishable food now.
[00:57:14.105 --> 00:57:18.986]   You see, the problem about living in a high-tech, just-on-time delivery system is, if you have
[00:57:18.986 --> 00:57:21.906]  people working together, in open society, it works.
[00:57:21.902 --> 00:57:27.724]  But when you bring technocrats in that try to deliberately sack it and shut it down, it creates total destruction.
[00:57:28.185 --> 00:57:43.192]  In his warning, he put great emphasis on difficulties to do with fertilizer in the country, the lack of which has the danger of having farmers' crop yields, something that has somehow not stopped the likes of Sri Lanka and the Netherlands and Canada from trying to clamp down on fertilizer use.
[00:57:43.772 --> 00:57:47.214]  In the service of their green agenda, which is not a green agenda.
[00:57:47.535 --> 00:57:50.417]  It is a post-industrial world collapse agenda.
[00:57:50.817 --> 00:57:56.281]  You realize how fundamental it is to shut off oil and coal and natural gas and not let us have alternatives?
[00:57:57.501 --> 00:57:58.922]  And say it's part of a great transition.
[00:57:59.563 --> 00:58:03.305]  You realize how fundamental it is when they do this and then constant headlines like this.
[00:58:04.086 --> 00:58:08.929]  I want to live on a farm is code for I want to get away from black people.
[00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:12.632]  What the hell does that even mean?
[00:58:14.662 --> 00:58:30.033]  So I cannot stress to you enough how big this is, how seismic this is, and how it's not COVID-19 that caused global starvation, but the globalists themselves.
[00:58:31.634 --> 00:58:38.673]   So what I'm going to do now is air clip 11, 9, 10, and 15 back to back.
[00:58:38.673 --> 00:58:52.034]   And then we're going to air back to back segueing out of this the two Tucker Carlson clips we have
[00:58:52.034 --> 00:58:58.992]   where he bravely exposes the admitted documents that the mandatory vaccines aren't vaccines and
[00:58:58.992 --> 00:59:07.313]   don't work and that this is a devastating weapon being used against us.
[00:59:07.505 --> 00:59:19.105]   We're going to air all of those clips 11, 9, 10, 15 and 21 and 22, back to back, and then I'm going to come back with the rest of the story.
[00:59:19.165 --> 00:59:20.266]  But this is not our opinion.
[00:59:21.927 --> 00:59:36.157]  Insurance actuaries we've been covering for a year and a half are now confirmed in Europe, in the UK, in Canada, in the US, in Australia, in New Zealand, everywhere, a 40 plus percent increase in deaths 18 to 63 working age.
[00:59:38.877 --> 00:59:47.245]  And a multi-thousand percent death rate increase in people 12 and up who were getting the shots.
[00:59:47.425 --> 00:59:55.913]  And now, we don't have numbers yet on the babies, but floods of reports are coming in about the mass death and carnage taking place with them.
[00:59:56.234 --> 01:00:01.699]  So we're going to hit, first the Globalist announcing, Yuval Harari and others, that you're obsolete.
[01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:06.153]  You'll be like an ant or a potted plant if you don't accept the augmentation.
[01:00:06.433 --> 01:00:08.255]  You won't be allowed into the future society.
[01:00:08.275 --> 01:00:09.015]  You'll be left behind.
[01:00:09.335 --> 01:00:15.020]  But they're shutting down the old society and bringing in a tyrannical society that's post-human.
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:21.626]  And once you submit to the AI takeover, the cyborg takeover, you're even caught more in a trap.
[01:00:22.639 --> 01:00:23.699]  But that's how they phrase it.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:24.860]  That's how they prepare it.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:29.002]  I had a clip on Friday I didn't get to, but it's everywhere where they're saying, you won't own your car.
[01:00:29.102 --> 01:00:30.122]  You won't own your cell phone.
[01:00:30.162 --> 01:00:30.983]  You won't own your house.
[01:00:31.303 --> 01:00:32.123]  You won't own your apartment.
[01:00:32.163 --> 01:00:33.224]  You'll rent everything.
[01:00:33.484 --> 01:00:44.129]  They want everyone to be totally dependent on the corporate system so they can then attach that to your behavior, the social credit score, and the carbon taxes to be able to operate and live your life.
[01:00:44.189 --> 01:00:44.929]  It isn't coming.
[01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.890]  It's here.
[01:00:46.704 --> 01:00:58.850]  And I told you weeks ago when Sri Lanka overthrew the corrupt government, I said, watch, they'll have QR codes out now, and they'll have food and gas rationing, and they'll roll in the next phase of the IMF World Bank plan, because we had the plans going back years ago.
[01:00:59.230 --> 01:01:00.651]  And sure enough, that then happened.
[01:01:01.832 --> 01:01:03.833]  We know the enemy battle plan.
[01:01:05.513 --> 01:01:08.915]  It only gets worse from here until we stand up and say no and stop complying.
[01:01:09.676 --> 01:01:18.213]   And so many people serve the system delusionally, Believing they're about to build a utopia when they're building a dystopia.
[01:01:18.934 --> 01:01:28.543]  So here are those reports back-to-back, and then we shall return and get into the mass deaths being caused by the shots in the latest developments.
[01:01:29.633 --> 01:01:46.296]  Previously in history, if you were on the wrong side of history, if you didn't understand what was happening and you lost the competition, then you ended up as some kind of serf or manual laborer being exploited by the people who understand and have the power.
[01:01:47.076 --> 01:01:54.097]  Now, if you're left behind, you're facing something far worse, which is to be completely irrelevant.
[01:01:54.257 --> 01:01:57.018]  They won't even need you as a serf or as a slave.
[01:01:57.298 --> 01:01:59.379]  The pandemic has been the ultimate disruptor.
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:03.182]  It has changed our realities and given us cause to pause and reflect.
[01:02:04.023 --> 01:02:07.425]  In the disruption is an opportunity for us to reset.
[01:02:08.386 --> 01:02:11.988]  And over the next three years, there is much work to do.
[01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:16.111]  We will build back better from the COVID crisis.
[01:02:18.513 --> 01:02:24.537]  Better, stronger, with an answer to the many challenges New Zealand already faced.
[01:02:24.877 --> 01:02:26.499]  This is our opportunity.
[01:02:27.785 --> 01:02:34.989]  Fortunately for us, we already have a blueprint for such a world in the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda.
[01:02:35.909 --> 01:02:44.673]  We've incorporated the principles of the 2030 Agenda into our domestic policymaking in a way that we hope will drive system-level actions.
[01:02:45.494 --> 01:02:48.195]  This is not just a new scorecard.
[01:02:48.815 --> 01:02:54.298]  It is about fundamentally changing how we make decisions and therefore how we allocate resources.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.682]  Now what is happening in New Zealand keeps astonishing me.
[01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:00.244]  It's sinister new race politics.
[01:03:00.665 --> 01:03:01.966]  It's new health fascism.
[01:03:02.486 --> 01:03:03.667]  It's harsh lockdowns.
[01:03:03.987 --> 01:03:08.031]  It's draconian plans to fight global warming by taxing cattle burps.
[01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.473]  And now the latest sign of authoritarianism.
[01:03:11.013 --> 01:03:14.116]  It's a plan to ban smoking for future generations.
[01:03:14.576 --> 01:03:16.218]  A plan now urged in Australia too.
[01:03:16.558 --> 01:03:23.844]  Here is New Zealand's Associate Health Minister explaining the end of the freedom to smoke in New Zealand, even in private.
[01:03:24.614 --> 01:03:34.542]  We are legislating for a smoke-free generation by making it an offence to sell or supply tobacco products to those aged 14 when the law comes into effect.
[01:03:35.643 --> 01:03:45.972]  As they age, they and future generations will never legally be able to purchase tobacco because the truth is there is no safe age to start smoking.
[01:03:45.992 --> 01:03:54.220]   The way it works is each year it goes by The ban extends to older people.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:59.164]  So, if you're 14 now, you'll never be able to legally buy cigarettes in New Zealand.
[01:03:59.824 --> 01:04:01.285]  Now, you may be like me.
[01:04:01.326 --> 01:04:04.888]  You loathe smoking, support bans on smokers stinking up your air.
[01:04:05.549 --> 01:04:08.411]  But this ban takes government bullying to a certain new level.
[01:04:08.691 --> 01:04:13.255]  Yet, just one party in the New Zealand Parliament, the ACT Party, has said it's against.
[01:04:13.615 --> 01:04:16.638]  Joining me is the leader of ACT, David Seymour.
[01:04:16.918 --> 01:04:18.639]  David Seymour, thank you so much for your time.
[01:04:18.779 --> 01:04:20.761]  Why is your party against this bill?
[01:04:22.199 --> 01:04:26.783]  There's no longer a public interest in further regulating smoking.
[01:04:27.623 --> 01:04:34.929]  We tax smokers to the extent that they are more than paying for any impact they have on the healthcare system.
[01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:42.595]  We have informed smokers to the point that I don't know anyone who doesn't think that smoking is dangerous.
[01:04:43.116 --> 01:04:55.923]   And we have regulated where people can smoke to the point where you can't smoke at work, you can't smoke in hospitality venues, You can't smoke anywhere except outdoor areas and your own home.
[01:04:56.003 --> 01:04:58.944]  So what is the remaining public interest?
[01:04:59.084 --> 01:05:02.065]  You can be as anti-smoking as you like, but that's not the question.
[01:05:02.725 --> 01:05:06.987]  There is no remaining public reason to further regulate smoking.
[01:05:07.027 --> 01:05:08.487]  They're only harming themselves.
[01:05:08.907 --> 01:05:09.767]  Fully informed.
[01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:11.808]  I think people should be able to make such choices.
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.023]  We're seeing, what we're seeing is that we are in a transition.
[01:05:16.063 --> 01:05:26.812]  We had this strong economic growth because of the work that this president has done in the past 18 months and now what we're seeing is a transition into stable and steady.
[01:05:27.253 --> 01:05:35.260]  So how did they release a vaccine and then make it mandatory when they didn't understand the long-term effects of the drug?
[01:05:36.343 --> 01:05:37.904]  That's a very good question.
[01:05:38.725 --> 01:05:39.686]  Here's Deborah Birx.
[01:05:40.126 --> 01:05:43.469]  She's the former White House COVID response director, again on Fox News.
[01:05:44.790 --> 01:05:56.120]  I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection, and I think we overplayed the vaccines and it made people then worry that it's not going to protect against severe disease and hospitalization.
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:06:03.687]  It will, but let's be very clear, 50% of the people who died from the Omicron surge were older, vaccinated.
[01:06:06.006 --> 01:06:06.367]  What?
[01:06:07.688 --> 01:06:13.293]  Stop the... Quote, I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection.
[01:06:13.393 --> 01:06:14.494]  Really, Deborah Birx?
[01:06:15.035 --> 01:06:22.402]  But somehow you forgot to mention that as people were being fired from their jobs for not taking this on the premise that if they took it they would never be infected?
[01:06:22.742 --> 01:06:24.264]  When do you get criminally charged?
[01:06:24.524 --> 01:06:25.004]  Soon, we hope.
[01:06:25.962 --> 01:06:36.212]  So how did they link to neurodegenerative disease, myocarditis, Bell's palsy, liver disease, impaired adaptive immunity, impaired DNA damage response, etc.? ?
[01:06:37.978 --> 01:06:44.162]  So, it's possible, in fact it's looking likely, that the vaccine might suppress the immune system.
[01:06:45.082 --> 01:06:59.231]  This fact, the authors concluded, will quote, have a wide range of consequences, not the least of which include the reactivation of latent viral infections and the reduced ability to effectively combat future infections.
[01:06:59.631 --> 01:07:00.292]  End quote.
[01:07:02.216 --> 01:07:06.160]  Again, we sincerely hope that's not true.
[01:07:07.141 --> 01:07:10.245]  But it's not just the conclusion of one scientific journal.
[01:07:10.625 --> 01:07:15.991]  The Lancet, maybe the most famous scientific journal in the world, released similar findings in February.
[01:07:16.031 --> 01:07:23.259]  The Lancet's piece was entitled, quote, Risk of Infection, Hospitalization, and Death Up to Nine Months After a Second Dose of COVID-19 Vaccine.
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:29.044]  A physician called Kenji Yamamoto made this observation with the data from the Lancet.
[01:07:29.504 --> 01:07:44.296]  He wrote this in a letter to the Journal of Virology, and we're quoting, the study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals eight months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals.
[01:07:47.178 --> 01:07:52.202]  Now your first response, if you're a humane person, to a line like that has got to be deep sympathy.
[01:07:53.393 --> 01:07:54.874]  Because people were misled?
[01:07:55.114 --> 01:07:55.954]  They were forced?
[01:07:56.834 --> 01:07:57.535]  They were forced!
[01:07:58.275 --> 01:07:59.775]  Medical ethics threw out the window.
[01:08:00.075 --> 01:08:02.156]  People were forced to take medicine they didn't want.
[01:08:02.656 --> 01:08:03.737]  And some of them may have been hurt by it.
[01:08:04.177 --> 01:08:05.778]  And you don't have to take this man's word for it.
[01:08:05.818 --> 01:08:07.098]  Pull up the Lancet study yourself.
[01:08:07.538 --> 01:08:12.040]  You won't find anything of the text of the article saying what Kenji Yamamoto said, which is weird.
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:14.881]  Why would the Lancet want to hide a major finding like that?
[01:08:15.885 --> 01:08:16.606]  We can't say.
[01:08:16.966 --> 01:08:20.869]  But if you look at Table 3 in the piece, here's what you'll find buried in the data.
[01:08:21.369 --> 01:08:36.141]  Among people around the age of 80 who have been double vaccinated, that would include people like Joe Biden, the per capita rate of medical incidences, including hospitalizations or death, is nearly twice as high as the rate of serious incidents for the unvaccinated.
[01:08:36.622 --> 01:08:38.503]  This is 180 days after vaccination.
[01:08:39.364 --> 01:08:39.965]  What is that?
[01:08:40.185 --> 01:08:47.185]  And why is no one interested?
[01:08:47.185 --> 01:08:54.185]   The nanny state isn't there to protect you, it's there to dehumanize you and domesticate
[01:08:54.185 --> 01:08:59.305]  you and make you weak so these people can kill you.
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:05.985]  Everything Tucker Carlson just read is on the record, the Lancet, you name it, that these so-called shots aren't vaccines and erase your immune system.
[01:09:06.857 --> 01:09:14.981]  And now the numbers are out in Israel and many other countries that you're three to four times more likely to be hospitalized or die if you've had these shots.
[01:09:15.041 --> 01:09:22.525]  But we knew that because the CDC in October of 2020 put out a document to cover their ass, the fine print.
[01:09:24.446 --> 01:09:25.266]  You can type it in yourself.
[01:09:25.306 --> 01:09:26.807]  Crude, just type it into a search engine.
[01:09:28.748 --> 01:09:34.891]  October 2020 CDC document lists possible side effects of COVID vaccine.
[01:09:36.604 --> 01:09:44.952]  Microcarditis, heart attacks, blood clots, infertility, bloody skin rashes.
[01:09:45.012 --> 01:09:54.661]  I mean, it lists more than 50 things because they knew they'd already tested it on rats and on guinea pigs and on a bunch of other animals.
[01:09:55.702 --> 01:09:57.063]  And we know China did secret tests.
[01:09:57.083 --> 01:09:58.445]  They were planning this all along.
[01:09:58.825 --> 01:10:00.587]  It is erasing people's immune system.
[01:10:01.570 --> 01:10:05.776]  So when they release the next real attack, these people will die en masse.
[01:10:06.136 --> 01:10:09.781]  And if you remove enough people, you don't have 2.2 children for every adult.
[01:10:10.122 --> 01:10:11.504]  Civilization will collapse.
[01:10:12.766 --> 01:10:14.408]  They're killing the gullible.
[01:10:14.608 --> 01:10:15.409]  It's an IQ test.
[01:10:16.241 --> 01:10:18.762]  FDA safety surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines draft.
[01:10:19.063 --> 01:10:22.365]  Working list of possible adverse events, outcomes, subject to change.
[01:10:22.565 --> 01:10:24.766]  That's on their damn website.
[01:10:25.426 --> 01:10:26.367]  Exactly!
[01:10:27.167 --> 01:10:28.008]  That's only the first page.
[01:10:28.028 --> 01:10:28.868]  There's two pages of it.
[01:10:29.508 --> 01:10:33.311]  Exactly, precisely what happened.
[01:10:33.611 --> 01:11:06.488]   Dr. Michael Yidan, who retired a year before they launched this, the head of Pfizer's Research division, the head of their vaccine operations, specifically before that even came out, sued the German EU government and listed a 40-plus page document with hundreds of links to major studies saying specifically it would attack the testicles and ovaries and would cause heart attacks and heart swelling and all the rest of it and blood clots.
[01:11:07.848 --> 01:11:08.789]  And that's what's so frustrating.
[01:11:09.602 --> 01:11:14.084]  And they want to go, okay, we launched our attack, you're locked down, take your shot, forget about it.
[01:11:14.964 --> 01:11:21.807]  Oh, yeah, there's suddenly record deaths and suddenly all these mystery deaths and suddenly all these blood clots and headlines on the side of buses.
[01:11:21.847 --> 01:11:23.027]  Blood clots are common.
[01:11:23.248 --> 01:11:24.288]  They're getting more common.
[01:11:24.548 --> 01:11:25.268]  Children get them.
[01:11:25.348 --> 01:11:27.029]  It's normal for children to have heart attacks.
[01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:40.029]   And you sit there watching these crazy scientists with behavioral psychology try to get us to accept it, and you ask, what type of maniac Would join these people and go along with this.
[01:11:41.169 --> 01:11:45.650]  Well, you saw Leonardo DiCaprio, big demoscript guy, with the Pope talking about depopulating.
[01:11:47.811 --> 01:11:53.693]  They're greedy, hateful people who want to get rid of the general public because they think you're dumb.
[01:11:53.713 --> 01:11:54.593]  And I'll give you a little secret.
[01:11:56.414 --> 01:12:02.275]  If you don't stand up to them, and if you don't say no to them, then you deserve what happens to you.
[01:12:02.295 --> 01:12:03.416]  But I'll tell you who doesn't deserve it.
[01:12:03.476 --> 01:12:04.036]  You know who that is.
[01:12:04.056 --> 01:12:07.417]  Except for the little children.
[01:12:08.871 --> 01:12:10.973]  And bring them to me, Christ said.
[01:12:11.373 --> 01:12:17.318]  Better for you to tie a millstone around your neck, a thousand pound stone, and throw yourself in the deepest ocean than to hurt one of mine.
[01:12:21.261 --> 01:12:22.142]  And what's their target?
[01:12:22.162 --> 01:12:22.562]  The children.
[01:12:23.863 --> 01:12:27.126]  COVID doesn't hurt children, but they give them the deadly shots to do.
[01:12:27.907 --> 01:12:30.008]  And I've got a stack of videos, my gosh.
[01:12:30.609 --> 01:12:31.910]  Did I go down a rabbit hole this morning?
[01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:36.932]  I saw trending on Twitter, hashtag vaccine damage.
[01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:39.014]  It was like number two on Twitter this morning.
[01:12:39.534 --> 01:12:40.455]  Guys, go to Twitter trending.
[01:12:40.475 --> 01:12:41.216]  I don't know if it's still there.
[01:12:42.156 --> 01:12:43.357]  Type in Twitter trending page.
[01:12:44.158 --> 01:12:47.640]  And it was like number two, maybe number three, I won't remember.
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:48.501]  It was right there at the top.
[01:12:50.542 --> 01:12:51.883]  And I clicked it.
[01:12:53.685 --> 01:13:00.670]  And I saw hundreds of articles and clips going through them that I'd never even seen before.
[01:13:00.970 --> 01:13:01.910]  And you think I know a lot.
[01:13:02.151 --> 01:13:02.451]  I don't.
[01:13:03.683 --> 01:13:07.365]  And so I probably watched 20 of the clips or more and read some of the articles.
[01:13:07.525 --> 01:13:10.026]  And I knew they were all accurate because it's already in the documents.
[01:13:13.087 --> 01:13:15.028]  Liberals saying, I took the shot.
[01:13:15.188 --> 01:13:16.448]  I've been paralyzed for a year.
[01:13:16.868 --> 01:13:17.589]  I took the shot.
[01:13:17.649 --> 01:13:19.910]  I bleed out of my ass and my eyeballs every day.
[01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:21.370]  My two-year-old took it.
[01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:22.011]  They're dead.
[01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:27.933]  And just clip after clip after clip after clip after clip after clip.
[01:13:29.634 --> 01:13:30.394]  My phone's around here.
[01:13:30.414 --> 01:13:32.775]  I can probably pull up Twitter, Twitter trending.
[01:13:33.612 --> 01:13:34.992]  Go to Twitter trending.
[01:13:35.553 --> 01:13:36.333]  It's main page.
[01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:38.894]  Twitter trending page.
[01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:39.854]  You just click on it.
[01:13:39.874 --> 01:13:41.395]  I'm about to tell you guys about this.
[01:13:41.415 --> 01:13:43.615]  I'm going to grab my phone and do it actually.
[01:13:43.635 --> 01:13:45.096]  We're going to have it a few minutes.
[01:13:45.136 --> 01:13:48.957]  I'll grab my phone and just let me know.
[01:13:48.997 --> 01:13:50.338]  Trump was right about everything.
[01:13:50.358 --> 01:13:53.659]  Yeah, it was earlier today.
[01:13:53.699 --> 01:13:57.080]  It was a vaccine hashtag.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.601]  Just put in hashtag vaccine damage at the top.
[01:13:59.621 --> 01:14:00.301]  See the search box?
[01:14:00.962 --> 01:14:10.962]   #VaccineDamage for vaccine injury.
[01:14:10.069 --> 01:14:10.589]  Yeah, that was it.
[01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.910]  Yeah, vaccine injury.
[01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:12.250]  That's it.
[01:14:12.690 --> 01:14:13.250]  A whole bunch of them.
[01:14:13.811 --> 01:14:14.351]  And look at that.
[01:14:14.691 --> 01:14:16.151]  Death certificates for their babies.
[01:14:16.191 --> 01:14:16.792]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:18.072]  Start scrolling through that.
[01:14:18.092 --> 01:14:19.633]  Why don't you go do that?
[01:14:19.653 --> 01:14:21.073]  There's a whole bunch of hashtags for it.
[01:14:24.955 --> 01:14:27.536]  All these people that lost their sons and daughters and babies.
[01:14:29.536 --> 01:14:30.857]  People on respirators.
[01:14:32.237 --> 01:14:34.098]  People that had four or five shots that's killing them.
[01:14:38.456 --> 01:14:39.216]  They'll put that in.
[01:14:39.296 --> 01:14:40.396]  Paralyzed faces.
[01:14:42.657 --> 01:14:43.257]  Scroll faster.
[01:14:44.077 --> 01:14:46.578]  See, it's updating so fast that I haven't even hardly seen any of this.
[01:14:47.818 --> 01:14:49.678]  Yeah, they made a weightlifter tag and he died right after.
[01:14:50.779 --> 01:14:53.159]  On and on and on and on.
[01:14:53.599 --> 01:14:55.300]  They're desperately trying to block it all.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.540]  And then Burks admits, oh, it's all fake.
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:58.520]  It's all a fraud.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.761]  Yeah, I think vaccine injury was a different one.
[01:15:02.773 --> 01:15:04.315]  I said it was like 20 categories of it.
[01:15:04.335 --> 01:15:06.397]  The point is, just go look at it for yourself.
[01:15:06.517 --> 01:15:08.639]  It will blow you away.
[01:15:10.361 --> 01:15:10.761]  Look at this.
[01:15:11.542 --> 01:15:18.188]  College basketball star Derek Gray, dead at 20, collapsed dead on the court after he took his third shot.
[01:15:21.712 --> 01:15:21.932]  That's E!
[01:15:22.232 --> 01:15:22.573]  Online.
[01:15:24.633 --> 01:15:30.576]  27-year-old triathlete doctor in Canada dies four days after she collapses while swimming.
[01:15:30.676 --> 01:15:33.097]  Fifth GTA doctor to die in two weeks.
[01:15:36.359 --> 01:15:43.042]  Triathlete 27 becomes fifth GTA doctor to die in July alone after the shot.
[01:15:43.062 --> 01:15:45.043]  44-year-old Canadian doctor dies unexpectedly.
[01:15:45.104 --> 01:15:49.026]  Sixth Canadian doctor to die within two weeks of heart attack.
[01:15:51.579 --> 01:16:00.202]  CDC unusually large number of newborns infected with a new potentially life-threatening virus that could trigger fever, poor feeding and seizures, blood clots and death.
[01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:01.942]  Isn't that just funny?
[01:16:02.303 --> 01:16:04.663]  And I was at the mall last week.
[01:16:09.125 --> 01:16:10.345]  Decided to buy a new sports jacket.
[01:16:11.626 --> 01:16:13.486]  All mothers are worn out and have holes in them, literally.
[01:16:14.347 --> 01:16:16.227]  And I saw big billboards up.
[01:16:16.707 --> 01:16:21.878]   Pregnant women should take their Yes, we need to fight back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:21.958 --> 01:16:22.558]  That's in Chicago.
[01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:25.501]  Elijah Schaffer makes a really great point in this tweet.
[01:16:25.341 --> 01:16:29.901]   some good news, fired for refusing COVID shot on religious grounds wins 10.3
[01:16:29.901 --> 01:16:34.541]   million dollar settlement. Yes, we need to fight back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:34.541 --> 01:16:41.461]   That's in Chicago. Elijah Schaefer makes a really great point in this tweet. He
[01:16:41.461 --> 01:16:48.261]   says strip clubs stayed open, Black Lives Matter was allowed to protest,
[01:16:46.799 --> 01:16:48.000]  Your church was shut down.
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.181]  You couldn't eat at your favorite restaurant.
[01:16:50.782 --> 01:16:57.425]  Now a disease with the same death rate as here, and you are simply asked not to bother the gays as they have massive orgies.
[01:16:57.605 --> 01:16:59.605]  What is going on?
[01:16:59.605 --> 01:17:08.245]  I challenge you to go to #vaccineinjury.
[01:17:08.245 --> 01:17:18.245]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.881]  Or hashtag vaccine death.
[01:17:13.661 --> 01:17:16.162]  Or hashtag vaccine lies.
[01:17:19.203 --> 01:17:19.983]  Look at this poor woman.
[01:17:21.524 --> 01:17:22.384]  She believed in the system.
[01:17:22.424 --> 01:17:24.785]  Now for a year, she can barely walk, has eczema all over her body.
[01:17:24.605 --> 01:17:35.585]  body. This is what she looked like before she took the shot.
[01:17:35.585 --> 01:17:38.505]   But the good news is, we'll play some of these clips in a moment.
[01:17:38.801 --> 01:17:44.903]  In Buckingham Palace, people started to gather, over half a million, to march in support of COVID vaccine victims.
[01:17:45.823 --> 01:17:48.624]  So they're unable to shut down the truth.
[01:17:49.365 --> 01:17:52.226]  But hey, two-thirds of UK women are suddenly missing periods.
[01:17:53.826 --> 01:17:56.307]  They're blaming it on stress and poor diet.
[01:17:58.052 --> 01:17:58.752]  Died of COVID.
[01:17:59.393 --> 01:18:01.113]  Really, agreed to take the jab.
[01:18:01.774 --> 01:18:06.996]  Anti-vaccine Olympian champion dies from COVID, age 51, after finally agreeing to take the jab.
[01:18:07.976 --> 01:18:08.677]  And then he died.
[01:18:11.838 --> 01:18:14.159]  And all these people's sons and daughters dying.
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:18.461]  We've got all these clips.
[01:18:21.022 --> 01:18:21.642]  Back to back.
[01:18:21.682 --> 01:18:23.323]  Colombia's most beloved popular singer.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:29.024]  Dario Gomez died suddenly after unexpectedly cardiac arrest after taking his third dose.
[01:18:30.445 --> 01:18:32.427]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[01:18:33.147 --> 01:18:38.431]  Here's a nurse who started having cardiac arrhythmias and all these problems after her second dose.
[01:18:38.832 --> 01:18:40.653]  So she went to the cardiologist and they gas lit her.
[01:18:40.673 --> 01:18:41.754]  We're going to play that clip.
[01:18:45.117 --> 01:18:45.697]  Here's another one.
[01:18:45.757 --> 01:18:49.841]  Our oldest son died from a sudden cardiac arrest 12 hours after the Johnson & Johnson shot.
[01:18:50.161 --> 01:18:50.941]  They all did the same thing.
[01:18:51.242 --> 01:18:51.882]  He was just 32.
[01:18:53.123 --> 01:18:54.004]  Here's the death certificate.
[01:18:55.555 --> 01:18:56.135]  Look at this woman.
[01:18:56.475 --> 01:18:57.135]  How it started.
[01:18:57.195 --> 01:19:01.336]  Dr. Laura Lopez injected her two-year-old.
[01:19:02.476 --> 01:19:03.576]  Said the two-year-old loved it.
[01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:05.777]  Now let's see how the two-year-old's doing.
[01:19:09.717 --> 01:19:14.738]  On June 22nd, she was happy to receive her Moderna vax.
[01:19:15.138 --> 01:19:15.959]  That's the strongest one.
[01:19:16.739 --> 01:19:18.839]  See her clapping after her first shot in the pic?
[01:19:19.439 --> 01:19:21.700]  Gave her a vaccine superhero cape.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.220]  Oh, you're a superhero now.
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:24.220]  You leave the planet.
[01:19:25.339 --> 01:19:26.659]  Have I not responded to your email?
[01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:27.200]  Here's why.
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:32.161]  One-year-old, I guess one-year-old, still sick, so sent back to ER.
[01:19:32.241 --> 01:19:38.643]  Test showed she has COVID, a cold, salmonella, stomach flu, yeast, diaper rash, all at once.
[01:19:39.904 --> 01:19:41.344]  I asked the doctor how this could possibly happen.
[01:19:41.384 --> 01:19:42.284]  She said daycare.
[01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:42.584]  Yeah.
[01:19:42.985 --> 01:19:45.105]  You can't figure out what you did, Dr. Lopez?
[01:19:45.585 --> 01:19:48.026]  You gave your one-year-old the shot and now they're fighting for their life?
[01:19:49.847 --> 01:19:52.828]  And it just goes on and on, on and on and on.
[01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:53.568]  It's heaven and hell.
[01:19:54.582 --> 01:19:56.162]  It's one of the best memes out there on the subject.
[01:19:56.623 --> 01:20:05.665]  They somehow managed to demonize coughs, sniffles, and having no symptoms at all, but normalized strokes, blood clots, and neurological disorders, and died suddenly.
[01:20:08.706 --> 01:20:09.406]  So let's do this.
[01:20:12.667 --> 01:20:13.667]  I got a bunch of clips here.
[01:20:14.991 --> 01:20:16.271]  Some of these, can we, you know what?
[01:20:16.351 --> 01:20:17.692]  We're not on AM and FM stations.
[01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:18.932]  This is an emergency transmission.
[01:20:18.952 --> 01:20:21.273]  It's internet only right now on InfoWars.com.
[01:20:21.293 --> 01:20:25.674]  So we can air, we can air the woman with the, with the eczema all over her body after the shots.
[01:20:28.235 --> 01:20:28.796]  Let's air.
[01:20:33.457 --> 01:20:34.297]  Sorry, say that again clearly.
[01:20:36.398 --> 01:20:37.098]  Yeah, let's go.
[01:20:39.639 --> 01:20:39.959]  Let's do 18, 19.
[01:20:44.752 --> 01:20:44.912]  20 to 30.
[01:20:48.604 --> 01:20:50.409]  What's there?
[01:20:50.429 --> 01:20:50.490]  18 to 30.
[01:20:52.836 --> 01:20:58.201]  Right now, this is a small smattering, literally just thousands of these videos.
[01:20:58.882 --> 01:21:13.397]  Here's just a small sampling of what's happening and then the meanwhile censoring and all these videos are taken down as fast as they go up because it's all a practice of how many people can we kill, how many people can we disease, and can we cover it up and normalize this mass death that all statistics show.
[01:21:13.437 --> 01:21:13.717]  Here it is.
[01:21:18.021 --> 01:21:20.063]  Am I allowed to say the V word on TikTok?
[01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:22.525]  Because I'm just about to and we're just going to see how that goes.
[01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:23.605]  Vaccine.
[01:21:23.926 --> 01:21:24.706]  Let's talk about it.
[01:21:25.107 --> 01:21:28.089]  So in 2020, I had just won a fitness competition.
[01:21:28.129 --> 01:21:34.977]   I maybe had a small patch of eczema on my hand, maybe my My inner arm here, and that was it.
[01:21:35.137 --> 01:21:35.858]  Never on my face.
[01:21:36.018 --> 01:21:37.019]  Never, ever, ever, ever.
[01:21:37.759 --> 01:21:45.305]  I had my eczema so well under control for 29 years that at that point, I was not actively working with a dermatologist.
[01:21:45.766 --> 01:21:46.927]  But let me tell you this.
[01:21:47.627 --> 01:21:52.131]  After every vaccine shot, and I had three, my eczema got worse.
[01:21:52.251 --> 01:21:56.914]  And I'm not saying that the vaccine triggered my TSW.
[01:21:57.255 --> 01:22:03.918]   I think it was a full, perfect storm Clusterfuck of things that happened to me.
[01:22:04.639 --> 01:22:11.943]  So as my skin got worse, I get told that I need to go see a dermatologist.
[01:22:12.723 --> 01:22:17.646]  So I go to the dermatologist, and the dermatologist prescribes me stronger and stronger creams.
[01:22:17.926 --> 01:22:20.327]  He says, oh my god, you're worsening the eczema.
[01:22:20.387 --> 01:22:21.748]  You need to go on glycosporin.
[01:22:21.788 --> 01:22:23.369]  You need to go on methotrexate.
[01:22:25.455 --> 01:22:34.281]  These are drugs for people that are undergoing cancer treatments, and I was putting it in my body and just blindly doing what the doctors are telling me.
[01:22:34.762 --> 01:22:37.224]  Fast forward to January of 2022, I go in full-blown TSW.
[01:22:40.606 --> 01:22:43.249]  Withdrawals I get I was shaking cold.
[01:22:43.469 --> 01:22:44.710]  I couldn't regulate my heat.
[01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:49.515]  I was oozing metallic liquid out of my skin I was gaining weight even though I wasn't eating.
[01:22:50.016 --> 01:23:02.331]   I literally just enjoyed myself last night and had crispy cauliflower and this is what happened to me so Man, if I... I can't even begin to tell you how upset I am.
[01:23:02.351 --> 01:23:04.112]  Holy hell!
[01:23:05.312 --> 01:23:12.074]  Do you know that I'm paying $1,164 on a medication called Dupixan?
[01:23:12.174 --> 01:23:13.814]  By the way, that's half off.
[01:23:14.534 --> 01:23:18.915]  On a drug that I did not need prior to this.
[01:23:19.335 --> 01:23:21.376]  Prior to the vaccines.
[01:23:21.476 --> 01:23:23.256]  Prior to, prior to, prior to.
[01:23:23.316 --> 01:23:24.636]  Sorry, OMG.
[01:23:25.457 --> 01:23:26.697]  I'm just so freaking fucked.
[01:23:27.352 --> 01:23:27.772]  Shut up.
[01:23:29.574 --> 01:23:33.757]  I don't want to be that person that fucking cries on this app, but god fucking damn it.
[01:23:36.879 --> 01:23:37.179]  Really?
[01:23:37.319 --> 01:23:42.263]  Like, I feel like my whole life's been stripped from me and this is so freaking painful.
[01:23:46.206 --> 01:23:49.829]  Yeah, I'm that person that cries on this app, but it's not about a boy.
[01:23:49.849 --> 01:23:51.590]  It's about my freaking life.
[01:23:56.113 --> 01:23:56.594]  Anyone else?
[01:23:57.617 --> 01:23:58.858]  Anyone else notice this?
[01:23:58.918 --> 01:24:05.344]  Like I was literally just following doctor's orders, following the government mandates and now this is my life.
[01:24:08.607 --> 01:24:09.127]  Am I allowed?
[01:24:09.528 --> 01:24:12.070]  Queensland faces a severe third COVID wave.
[01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:18.035]  Seven News can reveal the police commissioner will mandate a fourth booster shot for officers aged over 50.
[01:24:18.476 --> 01:24:22.820]  The service is forging ahead with mandates while the state government moves further away from them.
[01:24:25.154 --> 01:24:33.303]  Their mandate is to protect, and the Commissioner says she's protecting officers with mandates, sending out this direction.
[01:24:33.743 --> 01:24:38.648]  All members 50 years old and over must receive their fourth winter booster vaccination.
[01:24:39.169 --> 01:24:43.833]  It's in line with the Australian Technical Advisory Group's advice issued just a fortnight ago.
[01:24:44.454 --> 01:24:48.617]  But in Queensland there are still no vaccine mandates for firefighters.
[01:24:49.077 --> 01:24:53.781]  Healthcare workers need two shots, paramedics and anyone in aged care must have three.
[01:24:54.401 --> 01:24:57.483]  Only officers will need four to keep their jobs.
[01:24:57.844 --> 01:25:01.146]  I think the time for some of those mandates is possibly behind us at the moment.
[01:25:01.226 --> 01:25:06.550]  It's a little bit more complicated than it was early on when it was very clear that there was a benefit from some of those rules.
[01:25:06.650 --> 01:25:10.912]  Queensland's booster rate remains Australia's worst at 64.1%.
[01:25:11.893 --> 01:25:17.996]  Even as our hospitals face record numbers of COVID patients, above 1,000 today.
[01:25:18.396 --> 01:25:20.257]  There were 9,000 new cases.
[01:25:20.697 --> 01:25:22.518]  Queensland recorded 10 deaths.
[01:25:22.938 --> 01:25:24.599]  And the peak's not here yet.
[01:25:24.799 --> 01:25:27.741]  It could easily still be three or four weeks away if we don't intervene.
[01:25:28.061 --> 01:25:32.363]  A week on from the Origin Decider at Suncorp Stadium, the results are in.
[01:25:32.803 --> 01:25:37.084]  Griffith University research shows COVID cases have gone up 70%.
[01:25:38.065 --> 01:25:40.466]  Masks weren't a must, they still aren't.
[01:25:40.666 --> 01:25:46.908]  Well we're not mandating because people have to, we trust people to use their personal responsibility.
[01:25:47.168 --> 01:25:48.929]  The echo begins in a fortnight.
[01:25:49.069 --> 01:25:51.850]  Any gathering of people has the potential to be a super spreader event.
[01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:54.231]  Schools are taking extra precautions.
[01:25:54.591 --> 01:25:56.632]  We are really being careful.
[01:25:56.772 --> 01:25:59.954]  I mean, even something like we're not having full school assemblies now.
[01:26:00.194 --> 01:26:05.554]   At Marist College Ashgrove, masks are encouraged, not enforced, following the government letting
[01:26:05.554 --> 01:26:08.033]  Queenslanders make their choices.
[01:26:08.434 --> 01:26:15.633]  [Music]
[01:26:15.633 --> 01:26:25.634]  [Music]
[01:26:25.634 --> 01:26:35.633]  [Music]
[01:26:35.633 --> 01:26:45.633]  [Music]
[01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:55.633]  [Music]
[01:26:55.633 --> 01:27:05.633]  [Music]
[01:27:05.633 --> 01:27:15.633]  [Music]
[01:27:15.633 --> 01:27:16.633]  [Music]
[01:27:16.633 --> 01:27:19.213]  (upbeat music)
[01:27:19.047 --> 01:27:32.047]  [Music]
[01:27:32.047 --> 01:27:37.047]  My son, you know, was 32 years old.
[01:27:37.047 --> 01:27:43.047]  He was one of the happiest kids I've ever run across.
[01:27:43.047 --> 01:27:47.047]  And he just loved life.
[01:27:47.047 --> 01:27:51.047]  [Music]
[01:27:51.047 --> 01:27:56.047]   My name is Pamela Goodman, and my 32-year-old stepson, Benjamin,
[01:27:56.047 --> 01:28:02.047]   was killed by the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on March 14, 2021.
[01:28:02.584 --> 01:28:06.065]  Within 12 hours, he was dead of a cardiac arrest.
[01:28:06.486 --> 01:28:07.066]  Sudden death.
[01:28:09.495 --> 01:28:12.057]  We don't want any more people to die.
[01:28:13.457 --> 01:28:16.019]  Benjamin would not want anyone else to die.
[01:28:17.039 --> 01:28:19.401]  The autopsy is inconclusive.
[01:28:20.521 --> 01:28:28.246]  The medical examiner is changing their phone number, refusing to answer our calls or give us a toxicology report.
[01:28:28.666 --> 01:28:36.010]  The mainstream media is not reporting these deaths, these serious adverse reactions.
[01:28:37.131 --> 01:28:38.852]  We can't bring Benjamin back.
[01:28:40.427 --> 01:28:44.953]  And this is not only just about Benjamin, this is about all of humanity.
[01:28:46.294 --> 01:28:55.226]  Benjamin would not ever want anybody to take an experimental vaccine that could cause death or permanent injury.
[01:28:56.747 --> 01:29:00.612]   If he knew what he knew, What we know now.
[01:29:00.632 --> 01:29:01.612]  What we know now.
[01:29:02.633 --> 01:29:07.856]  In March, which no one is letting anyone know, no mainstream media outlets, nothing.
[01:29:07.896 --> 01:29:14.099]  You have to dig and dig and dig to find anything and even then you're called crazy and nothing has nothing to do with anything.
[01:29:14.119 --> 01:29:15.420]  There's no correlation.
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:20.302]  Healthy people are just dropping dead of blood clots, everything.
[01:29:20.823 --> 01:29:28.787]  And everything is being hidden and Benjamin would never ever want anyone to die or be injured.
[01:29:30.339 --> 01:29:32.059]  This is horrific.
[01:29:32.139 --> 01:29:33.100]  This is criminal.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.140]  This is murder.
[01:29:35.579 --> 01:29:39.100]  and people need to wake up and speak out.
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:55.579]   So Russia has officially expelled the WHO and closed all of its offices in Moscow.
[01:29:55.802 --> 01:29:59.824]  So Russia has never pushed the mRNA on its people.
[01:30:00.565 --> 01:30:04.927]  Instead, they've had their own, and Putin has always said that it's voluntary.
[01:30:05.488 --> 01:30:11.291]  Of all the places in the world to let their people maintain bodily sovereignty, Russia is doing it.
[01:30:12.031 --> 01:30:13.332]  Why isn't the United States?
[01:30:14.433 --> 01:30:19.996]  I was actually able to get in to see a cardiologist, so that way I didn't have to wait in the ER for hours.
[01:30:20.768 --> 01:30:26.710]  So this cardiologist comes in, and he basically comes in already kind of in a defensive mode.
[01:30:27.311 --> 01:30:36.995]  He said he read my chart before coming in, and he's seen a cardiologist a few weeks ago, and apparently they know each other very well, the one that gaslighted me.
[01:30:37.015 --> 01:30:40.576]  And he basically was like, so what are you doing here?
[01:30:41.697 --> 01:30:53.161]   And I explained all my symptoms to him, And he basically told me that, well, the cardiologist already saw you, so what can I do for you, basically, with that type of attitude.
[01:30:53.802 --> 01:30:57.445]  I asked him to order EKG, and he told me, you don't need an EKG.
[01:30:58.865 --> 01:31:01.746]  The EKG that I did in ER was back in April.
[01:31:02.066 --> 01:31:04.827]  It's, what, July going on August now?
[01:31:05.147 --> 01:31:08.027]  And he basically was like, you don't need an EKG.
[01:31:08.087 --> 01:31:12.669]  So I had to basically fight him on this and tell him, look, I'm here now for chest pain.
[01:31:13.249 --> 01:31:14.369]  I'm short of breath.
[01:31:14.469 --> 01:31:16.450]  I've been having heart palpitations all night.
[01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:18.170]  I need an EKG.
[01:31:18.710 --> 01:31:20.110]  And he got super defensive.
[01:31:20.150 --> 01:31:25.132]  He's like, fine, I'll order you an EKG, not because I think you need it, because you're telling me to.
[01:31:27.386 --> 01:31:31.628]  And then he goes on to tell me, you know, let me tell you my honest opinion.
[01:31:31.788 --> 01:31:33.128]  Okay, so I'm like, what is it?
[01:31:33.228 --> 01:31:34.909]  I want to hear him out, obviously.
[01:31:35.529 --> 01:31:45.293]  And he says, you know, you're having anxiety and you need to follow up with your primary doctor because you need to get treated for a possible panic disorder.
[01:31:46.013 --> 01:31:48.815]  Like, like, unbelievable.
[01:31:50.715 --> 01:31:54.057]  You know, I told him, yeah, I am having anxiety.
[01:31:54.077 --> 01:31:57.078]  I mean, I was sick for going on seven months.
[01:31:58.021 --> 01:32:04.205]  With no treatment and no help from the healthcare system, who the hell isn't gonna have anxiety after this?
[01:32:05.046 --> 01:32:08.648]  This is what's going on, and this is the gaslighting that's going on.
[01:32:09.629 --> 01:32:15.813]  You know, these injured people are getting neglected, left and right, and being gaslighted.
[01:32:17.835 --> 01:32:20.577]  I'm sorry for all the people that's going through this.
[01:32:21.117 --> 01:32:22.018]  You know, I'm sorry.
[01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:29.322]  My heart goes out to you guys because I understand and I feel your pain and suffering.
[01:32:29.802 --> 01:32:31.003]  Just know you're not alone.
[01:32:31.023 --> 01:32:44.391]  Heart attacks in young and middle age are at multi-thousand percent all over the world.
[01:32:44.411 --> 01:32:50.815]  In football, other sports, they're dying in mass.
[01:32:54.732 --> 01:33:08.128]  We're standardizing depopulation.
[01:33:08.148 --> 01:33:10.311]  The current is to accept mass deaths.
[01:33:10.391 --> 01:33:11.612]  All of Texas is going to be put up with.
[01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:14.253]  Guerrilla attacks are about to come.
[01:33:14.253 --> 01:33:24.733]  This is folks in London protesting for vaccine damage.
[01:33:24.951 --> 01:33:25.672]  Vaccine injured.
[01:33:26.572 --> 01:33:32.215]  Humanity is rising.
[01:33:32.856 --> 01:33:35.157]  Infowars and Tip the Spear, thank you for keeping us on air.
[01:33:35.177 --> 01:33:42.701]  We'll show you a vaccine seizure video.
[01:33:45.649 --> 01:33:48.814]  And then the key one, TikTok star videos.
[01:33:49.254 --> 01:33:51.638]  And then the next time we hear from her, she's dead three days later.
[01:33:52.599 --> 01:33:54.021]  This is such a sad clip coming up.
[01:33:56.104 --> 01:33:58.768]  Poor woman makes a joke about vaccines and then dies.
[01:34:00.230 --> 01:34:02.230]  This is the reality, folks.
[01:34:02.230 --> 01:34:04.230]  [crowd shouting]
[01:34:04.230 --> 01:34:06.230]  [crowd shouting]
[01:34:06.230 --> 01:34:08.230]  [crowd shouting]
[01:34:08.230 --> 01:34:10.230]  [crowd shouting]
[01:34:10.230 --> 01:34:12.230]  [crowd shouting]
[01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:14.230]  [crowd shouting]
[01:34:14.230 --> 01:34:16.230]  [crowd shouting]
[01:34:16.230 --> 01:34:18.230]   We already tested deadly shots on the troops with anthrax and other injections.
[01:34:18.230 --> 01:34:19.190]  other injections.
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:23.744]  The 96,000 that get away with killing tens of thousands of troops, they admit.
[01:34:23.764 --> 01:34:24.765]  23,000 die from the anthrax shot.
[01:34:25.525 --> 01:34:27.527]  Tests to see if they can get away with it in the general public.
[01:34:27.887 --> 01:34:28.808]  Now they've gone operational.
[01:34:29.188 --> 01:34:29.889]  Now watch this clip.
[01:34:32.921 --> 01:34:44.349]  Poor woman bragged about getting the shot and it was dead days later.
[01:34:48.331 --> 01:34:50.873]  Well guys, I'm going to get the needle today.
[01:34:51.093 --> 01:34:51.974]  Everybody wish me luck.
[01:34:51.994 --> 01:34:56.236]  Getting it right here or right here, I'm not sure.
[01:34:57.717 --> 01:34:58.258]  Wish me luck.
[01:35:00.819 --> 01:35:01.540]  Have a great day.
[01:35:02.756 --> 01:35:04.477]  Good morning, fuckers and fuck-ups.
[01:35:04.657 --> 01:35:07.518]  I am vaccinated, caffeinated, and freshly masturbated.
[01:35:07.558 --> 01:35:09.078]  Time to grab the day by its balls.
[01:35:09.599 --> 01:35:10.759]  Consensually, of course.
[01:35:11.619 --> 01:35:12.480]  I'm home.
[01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:14.741]  And I feel fine.
[01:35:14.881 --> 01:35:15.981]  I feel perfect.
[01:35:16.421 --> 01:35:16.922]  So far.
[01:35:16.942 --> 01:35:19.282]  It's only been 21 minutes.
[01:35:19.362 --> 01:35:21.483]  I'll keep you updated.
[01:35:21.543 --> 01:35:29.146]  And then they killed her.
[01:35:29.186 --> 01:35:30.707]  Candace Merly dead.
[01:35:32.884 --> 01:35:33.804]  Yet a few days later.
[01:35:36.445 --> 01:35:39.786]  All right, I just played eight different clips, but I'm gonna play one of them again.
[01:35:39.866 --> 01:35:40.066]  Clip 19.
[01:35:43.267 --> 01:35:45.888]  Of all those clips, what was the most important?
[01:35:46.148 --> 01:35:46.348]  Clip 19.
[01:35:47.868 --> 01:35:59.711]  Whether you're in Canada, or whether you're in leftist-controlled areas of the U.S., or whether you're in Europe, they selectively choose who must take the shots.
[01:35:59.771 --> 01:36:00.191]  And who?
[01:36:01.092 --> 01:36:01.532]  Above 50.
[01:36:03.635 --> 01:36:08.979]  It hurts children, it hurts everybody, but older people particularly.
[01:36:10.114 --> 01:36:12.076]  So firefighters, you don't have to take it.
[01:36:12.656 --> 01:36:14.458]  And police, you're only going to take two shots.
[01:36:15.159 --> 01:36:17.601]  But if you're above 50, you're going to take four or five shots.
[01:36:18.161 --> 01:36:18.962]  And that's just a start.
[01:36:18.982 --> 01:36:26.009]  So they're training you that a computer tells you who takes the shots, who gets euthanized, who gets killed.
[01:36:26.349 --> 01:36:28.211]  They just normalize people dropping dead.
[01:36:28.711 --> 01:36:30.112]  They censor you when you complain.
[01:36:30.653 --> 01:36:31.714]  This is the eugenics.
[01:36:32.214 --> 01:36:33.816]  This is the Logan's Run.
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:36.762]  This is the depopulation.
[01:36:37.062 --> 01:36:39.145]  And this isn't some movie we're watching.
[01:36:39.866 --> 01:36:49.541]  This is satanic, evil bureaucrats who always wear pink or shiny blue glasses and are liberal and non-threatening, carrying out their cult operations.
[01:36:51.493 --> 01:36:53.034]  And they want full control of the police.
[01:36:53.054 --> 01:36:55.555]  And the police they like don't get the deadly shot.
[01:36:55.595 --> 01:36:57.976]  The ones they don't like, the computer a lot.
[01:36:57.996 --> 01:36:58.937]  It's a special shot.
[01:36:59.217 --> 01:37:00.938]  That's come out that most of the shots are saline.
[01:37:01.798 --> 01:37:05.480]  But for people that don't get saline, you might survive, you probably won't.
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:07.521]  This is how they kill us.
[01:37:07.841 --> 01:37:12.663]  If they march us into pits and shot us like Nazis or into Cyclone B gas chambers, we'd fight back.
[01:37:12.923 --> 01:37:16.865]  But if it's all done biomedically with bureaucrats saving us, then it's okay.
[01:37:16.885 --> 01:37:19.687]  So there's clip 19 one more time.
[01:37:19.727 --> 01:37:20.067]  Here it is.
[01:37:21.161 --> 01:37:21.561]  Hey, pause again.
[01:37:21.581 --> 01:37:23.062]  Back at the beginning, again.
[01:37:23.102 --> 01:37:25.422]  Severe COVID wave, which isn't even true.
[01:37:25.502 --> 01:37:28.243]  And supposedly you take the shot, you're protected, but you're not.
[01:37:28.303 --> 01:37:30.084]  Above 50, you've got to take more.
[01:37:30.244 --> 01:37:32.744]  Again, the idea that the government decides who takes shots.
[01:37:32.564 --> 01:37:37.764]   pause again back at the beginning again severe COVID wave which isn't even true
[01:37:37.764 --> 01:37:42.843]   and supposedly you take the shot you're protected but you're not above 50 you've
[01:37:42.843 --> 01:37:48.163]   got to take more again the the idea that the government decides who takes shots
[01:37:48.163 --> 01:37:55.804]   this is their plan start over from the start Queensland faces a severe third
[01:37:55.804 --> 01:37:59.443]   COVID wave at seven news can reveal the Police Commissioner will mandate a
[01:37:59.443 --> 01:38:04.003]   fourth booster shot for officers aged over 50 the service is forging ahead
[01:38:04.003 --> 01:38:09.364]   with mandates while the state government moves further away from them
[01:38:09.710 --> 01:38:16.094]  Their mandate is to protect and the Commissioner says she's protecting officers with mandates.
[01:38:16.494 --> 01:38:17.835]  Sending out this direction.
[01:38:18.295 --> 01:38:23.198]  All members 50 years old and over must receive their fourth winter booster vaccination.
[01:38:23.718 --> 01:38:28.421]  It's in line with the Australian Technical Advisory Group's advice issued just a fortnight ago.
[01:38:28.441 --> 01:38:33.144]  But in Queensland there are still no vaccine mandates for firefighters.
[01:38:33.624 --> 01:38:38.347]  Healthcare workers need two shots, paramedics and anyone in aged care must have three.
[01:38:38.947 --> 01:38:42.049]  Only officers will need four to keep their jobs.
[01:38:42.369 --> 01:38:45.591]  I think the time for some of those mandates is possibly behind us at the moment.
[01:38:45.611 --> 01:38:51.114]  It's a little bit more complicated than it was early on when it was very clear that there was a benefit from some of those rules.
[01:38:51.254 --> 01:38:56.600]  Queensland's booster rate remains Australia's worst at 64.1%.
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:02.566]  Even as our hospitals face record numbers of COVID patients, above 1,000 today.
[01:39:02.967 --> 01:39:04.809]  There were 9,000 new cases.
[01:39:05.249 --> 01:39:07.091]  Queensland recorded 10 deaths.
[01:39:07.492 --> 01:39:09.173]  And the peak's not here yet.
[01:39:09.354 --> 01:39:12.297]  It could easily still be three or four weeks away if we don't intervene.
[01:39:12.617 --> 01:39:16.918]  A week on from the Origin Decider at Suncorp Stadium, the results are in.
[01:39:17.338 --> 01:39:20.859]  Griffith University research shows COVID cases have gone up 70%.
[01:39:22.599 --> 01:39:25.020]  Masks weren't a must, they still aren't.
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:31.281]  Well, we're not mandating because people have to, we trust people to use their personal responsibility.
[01:39:31.321 --> 01:39:33.521]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:39:33.602 --> 01:39:44.504]   So, they cooked up a bioweapon, they released it, the shot gives you the same bioweapon, and now they're saying over 50 police Have to take this shot that is 100% connected to killing him.
[01:39:47.365 --> 01:39:49.146]  That's where we are in the year 2022.
[01:39:49.186 --> 01:40:00.992]  And that's why they don't want this broadcast today, because the 8 or 9 clips we played, we have hundreds and hundreds of things just as horrifying.
[01:40:05.875 --> 01:40:12.423]   And they think those are all isolated individuals, these hyenas, These wolves can have their way with.
[01:40:14.104 --> 01:40:20.748]  But we're here unifying the people to understand it's premeditated, it's depopulation, it's an attack on humanity.
[01:40:22.389 --> 01:40:24.790]  So people ask me, Jones, how are you handling show trials?
[01:40:25.471 --> 01:40:26.751]  How are you handling all these attacks?
[01:40:27.212 --> 01:40:29.413]  Well, if they kill me or put me in prison, it makes me a martyr.
[01:40:29.673 --> 01:40:36.137]  They've got to set me against dead kids and say, oh, he questioned about shooting, even though I never said the name of the parents and never attacked them.
[01:40:36.958 --> 01:40:42.559]   to try to then shut us down so we're not here warning people during this critical time.
[01:40:42.559 --> 01:40:52.398]   So how am I doing? I'm a man. I'm not a loser. I'm a warrior. And I expect to be attacked.
[01:40:52.398 --> 01:41:00.318]   That's why we're here. That isn't what matters. I don't need hugs. What I need is financial
[01:41:00.318 --> 01:41:06.157]   support and prayer and you to share the articles at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com
[01:41:06.157 --> 01:41:08.398]  and banned that video like your life depends on it.
[01:41:08.627 --> 01:41:11.389]  I need people to go to this URL, Band.Video.
[01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:20.636]  I need you to find what you think are the best reports, the best information, and I want you to share them, because that is the Revolutionary Act.
[01:41:23.278 --> 01:41:26.921]  That is what is going to change the world.
[01:41:27.847 --> 01:41:30.268]  Because we have an attempt to depopulate.
[01:41:30.288 --> 01:41:31.988]  We have an attempt to take over human will.
[01:41:32.449 --> 01:41:34.789]  We have an attempt to build a post-human future.
[01:41:35.069 --> 01:41:38.051]  Even the Wall Street Journal says, looking forward to the end of humans.
[01:41:38.111 --> 01:41:41.772]  And I say no to that, and I'm betting on you, and I believe in you.
[01:41:42.332 --> 01:41:56.757]  And we are announcing the human supremacy movement of humans under Genesis, given the license over this planet for our next level for interdimensional and multi-planet, multi-galaxy expansion.
[01:41:58.439 --> 01:41:59.480]  And that's really what this is.
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:01.661]  They don't want you to have your birthright.
[01:42:02.001 --> 01:42:03.462]  They want you to roll over and die.
[01:42:03.702 --> 01:42:08.245]  They want you to live in walled prison cities, and we're not going to do it.
[01:42:08.585 --> 01:42:09.806]  We're not going to be part of it.
[01:42:13.008 --> 01:42:13.928]  They've cut the food off.
[01:42:14.509 --> 01:42:15.429]  They're cutting the energy off.
[01:42:16.850 --> 01:42:18.071]  We're living inside the New World Order.
[01:42:18.671 --> 01:42:36.622]   And I'm just so blessed to have a crew and an organization, despite everything that's happened, Thanks to you, the listener and viewer, that is still on air because of your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support.
[01:42:36.902 --> 01:42:42.627]  Our most important work ever is happening right now and we all know it.
[01:42:43.067 --> 01:42:46.951]  So I want you to all go now and take the articles and videos and share them.
[01:42:46.991 --> 01:42:49.333]  I want you to buy product at InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:42:49.633 --> 01:42:55.858]  And I want you to pray for your awakening, our awakening, and God give us provision to stand against the enemy.
[01:42:57.588 --> 01:42:59.688]  This is July 30th emergency broadcast.
[01:43:01.449 --> 01:43:03.209]  July 30th emergency broadcast.
[01:43:03.989 --> 01:43:05.930]  Alex Jones makes a statement on Infowars bankruptcy.
[01:43:07.290 --> 01:43:08.770]  Yeah, we're maxed out.
[01:43:09.631 --> 01:43:14.012]  And our enemies claim we have hundreds of millions of dollars and put all these fake financials and scramble garbage.
[01:43:14.332 --> 01:43:15.472]  And now it's all in federal court.
[01:43:15.832 --> 01:43:22.854]  Not that I trust federal court, but the chosen state judges of Connecticut and Texas, Democrat Party operatives, trying to claim all this is true.
[01:43:23.174 --> 01:43:24.734]  They're having their bluff called.
[01:43:27.429 --> 01:43:28.249]  I will continue on it.
[01:43:28.269 --> 01:43:29.029]  We've got a plan.
[01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:47.334]  If you buy the products at InfoWareStore.com, if you get the bodies, if you get the Vitamin Refusion, if you get the Diet Force, if you get the X2, if you get the Great Reset, if you get Alex's War, if you continue to fund us, everything we do is like in Super Mario Brothers, when he hits the mushroom, he gets invincible.
[01:43:47.914 --> 01:43:50.495]  We've hit that point right now.
[01:43:53.096 --> 01:43:53.816]  And they know that.
[01:43:55.615 --> 01:44:03.517]  And so all of my 28 years on air, all the work we've done over the years, is now coming down to a head right now.
[01:44:04.177 --> 01:44:09.938]  And I've done my job, and you've done your job, and I salute you and I thank you, but now is the time to be informed.
[01:44:10.578 --> 01:44:12.038]  Now is the time to be involved.
[01:44:12.498 --> 01:44:13.919]  Now is the time to be standing up.
[01:44:14.379 --> 01:44:16.299]  Now is the time to be saying no to the tyrants.
[01:44:17.019 --> 01:44:18.199]  It's such a beautiful time.
[01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:21.040]  It's scary, it's painful, it's wild.
[01:44:23.558 --> 01:44:26.079]  You've got China threatening to blow up Nancy Pelosi's plane.
[01:44:26.099 --> 01:44:28.860]  You've got Biden the most unpopular president in U.S.
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:29.160]  history.
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:32.541]  You've got Biden saying we're not in a recession and gaslighting everybody.
[01:44:32.561 --> 01:44:34.662]  You've got Biden creating permanent U.S.
[01:44:34.722 --> 01:44:37.904]  Postal Service division to deliver and return ballots in U.S.
[01:44:37.944 --> 01:44:39.644]  elections to do it by fraud.
[01:44:39.864 --> 01:44:41.225]  And that's how their dictatorship works.
[01:44:41.285 --> 01:44:44.926]  But we're aware of them and we're not scared of their intimidation.
[01:44:46.187 --> 01:44:50.388]  And we are not going to back down.
[01:44:50.729 --> 01:44:51.749]  And that is a beautiful thing.
[01:44:55.196 --> 01:44:56.396]  But we've got other really bad news.
[01:44:57.977 --> 01:45:03.598]  House passes assault weapons ban to ban all semi-automatics in the United States.
[01:45:04.579 --> 01:45:06.239]  There's a great meme that explains it all.
[01:45:07.139 --> 01:45:14.401]  All the cops in the photos stood down, 450 plus police in the Uvalde, under orders.
[01:45:16.282 --> 01:45:20.383]  One good guy with a gun is worth more than 376 cops, over 450 now, who did nothing.
[01:45:24.741 --> 01:45:35.846]  Two men, Johnny Hurtley and Elijah Dickin, they stopped mass shooters down their tracks.
[01:45:36.287 --> 01:45:40.128]  These police stood down because they're bureaucrats of the system.
[01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:43.130]  And that's what the establishment's scared of.
[01:45:45.026 --> 01:45:50.910]  So we talk about human supremacy, whether we're going to believe in ourselves and stand up for our rights or be slaves.
[01:45:51.411 --> 01:45:56.094]  And the media totally freaked out about that rant I did, like Wednesday, went viral on Thursday.
[01:45:56.914 --> 01:46:01.998]  I responded to it on Infowars.com, the critics of the epic human supremacy speech.
[01:46:02.739 --> 01:46:05.921]  Here's the original Alex Jones human supremacy legendary speech.
[01:46:07.469 --> 01:46:08.009]  But look at this.
[01:46:08.690 --> 01:46:10.511]  This is the evolution of dehumanization.
[01:46:11.011 --> 01:46:24.718]  An alone, desperate man with no family, no women, no future, believing that if he rejects his manhood and wears a yellow dress and a purse and wears his mask, that he will be all alone, somehow empowered.
[01:46:26.331 --> 01:46:27.212]  He's been isolated.
[01:46:27.252 --> 01:46:27.733]  We love him.
[01:46:27.753 --> 01:46:29.314]  He's been isolated.
[01:46:29.334 --> 01:46:29.835]  He's been hurt.
[01:46:29.895 --> 01:46:30.796]  We don't make fun of him.
[01:46:31.177 --> 01:46:32.378]  It's so sad what they did to him.
[01:46:32.959 --> 01:46:34.921]  He didn't have a father or a mother to lead him.
[01:46:34.941 --> 01:46:37.664]  He's just a humanized slave alone.
[01:46:39.648 --> 01:46:40.689]  Saying, I don't want to be a man.
[01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:42.551]  I give up.
[01:46:42.711 --> 01:46:43.311]  I surrender.
[01:46:44.092 --> 01:46:45.173]  I give up to the New World Order.
[01:46:46.094 --> 01:46:47.535]  But then you have the next phase.
[01:46:48.616 --> 01:46:55.923]  That guy that beat up the people at the grocery store, the little convenience store, and screamed, it's ma'am, it's ma'am.
[01:46:56.283 --> 01:46:57.204]  The convicted felon.
[01:46:59.426 --> 01:47:00.567]  Healthy, happy, and whole.
[01:47:02.148 --> 01:47:04.951]  Trans rights are humans' rights.
[01:47:06.872 --> 01:47:19.463]  So we go from a man rejecting his masculinity and who he is and his office in the world, to a creature that looks like a space alien, on purpose, that's how they all dress, trans rights or human rights.
[01:47:19.723 --> 01:47:21.204]  They're not transitioning to be a woman.
[01:47:22.765 --> 01:47:24.247]  They're transitioning from being a human.
[01:47:27.209 --> 01:47:31.553]  Whether it's the man that's over the nuclear weapons, it looks just the same.
[01:47:32.453 --> 01:47:33.614]  And you transition into this.
[01:47:34.864 --> 01:47:38.906]  Tattooed black alien man now wants one of his legs amputated.
[01:47:38.926 --> 01:47:46.130]  It's not enough to deform yourself and kill your humanity and show these things you've given up who you are.
[01:47:46.631 --> 01:47:50.533]  Once you accept that transmission, they want you to chop yourself up.
[01:47:51.674 --> 01:47:52.954]  And that's who these things are.
[01:47:54.355 --> 01:47:55.075]  That's what this is.
[01:47:58.237 --> 01:48:03.020]  They somehow managed to demonize coughs, sniffles, and having no symptoms at all.
[01:48:04.571 --> 01:48:11.558]  But normalized strokes, blood clots, and neurological disorders, and died suddenly, unexpectedly, unexplainedly.
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:17.644]  So, I'm going to air too many documentaries that haven't gotten the attention they deserve.
[01:48:18.365 --> 01:48:23.770]  We haven't found the one I want, Endgame 2.0, that I put out 15 years ago, 14 years ago.
[01:48:24.191 --> 01:48:26.233]  But here are two of the others, back-to-back.
[01:48:28.467 --> 01:48:32.231]  New World Order, Blueprint of Mad Men, full-length documentary, 39 minutes.
[01:48:32.871 --> 01:48:36.715]  And then Endgame 2019, Democracy of Genocide, back-to-back.
[01:48:36.735 --> 01:48:38.176]  We'll end this live transmission.
[01:48:38.537 --> 01:48:40.999]  We'll re-loop it until 4 p.m.
[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:42.320]  on Sunday.
[01:48:44.082 --> 01:48:44.963]  Today's July 30th.
[01:48:45.083 --> 01:48:45.924]  It'll be tomorrow.
[01:48:46.665 --> 01:48:47.525]  And I'll cover it all.
[01:48:47.706 --> 01:48:49.547]  Every day here, we're blessed.
[01:48:50.048 --> 01:48:51.990]  Every day here, we're so happy to be here.
[01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:58.573]  But go to InfoWarsTore.com and get the Great Reset, the Death Star Plans, and the War for the World.
[01:48:59.133 --> 01:49:00.074]  Get Alex's War.
[01:49:00.574 --> 01:49:02.235]  Get Ultimate Turmeric Formula Bodies.
[01:49:02.735 --> 01:49:04.296]  Get Vitamin Mineral Fusion in stock.
[01:49:04.957 --> 01:49:06.057]  Get our new Diet Fours.
[01:49:06.538 --> 01:49:08.579]  And keep us on air because the fight is now.
[01:49:08.999 --> 01:49:11.560]  We've reached a critical juncture in all of this.
[01:49:12.361 --> 01:49:15.203]  We won't let humanity be enslaved to the present planet.
[01:49:15.603 --> 01:49:19.045]  We will stand and we will win because God is on our side.
[01:49:19.721 --> 01:49:20.621]  Great job of the crew.
[01:49:20.942 --> 01:49:27.585]  Here are these two mini documentaries that have gotten almost no attention in the last 10 years that are now being brought back to the fore.
[01:49:27.625 --> 01:49:28.505]  I hope you share them.
[01:49:28.845 --> 01:49:29.566]  I hope you clip them.
[01:49:29.586 --> 01:49:31.667]  I hope you get them out because you are the resistance.
[01:49:31.727 --> 01:49:32.367]  You are the power.
[01:49:32.867 --> 01:49:36.869]  Here are the reports and I'll see you back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:49:36.708 --> 01:49:43.708]  him central for the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:49:43.708 --> 01:49:50.708]  [music]
[01:49:51.108 --> 01:49:50.938]   Even though I'm just a lowly person, and aren't part of the greater supreme homeland of people in black uniforms that I
[01:49:50.938 --> 01:49:56.309]   look up to, I'm still part of the federal family that Janet talks about
[01:49:56.309 --> 01:50:06.509]  because I snoop for them.
[01:50:05.406 --> 01:50:06.946]  And that's what America's about.
[01:50:07.426 --> 01:50:09.367]  Total schizophrenic paranoia.
[01:50:09.467 --> 01:50:12.288]  I tell you what folks, we got some breaking news.
[01:50:13.048 --> 01:50:14.289]  Stop this and start it over.
[01:50:15.029 --> 01:50:20.711]  I've been saying they're going to kill Biden claiming it's COVID or assassinating and now he's had four shots.
[01:50:21.291 --> 01:50:22.752]  Now he has another positive test.
[01:50:22.792 --> 01:50:24.132]  They say he's super sick.
[01:50:24.852 --> 01:50:30.454]  He tested positive for COVID-19 today and apparently recovering from the virus and testing negative on Tuesday.
[01:50:30.915 --> 01:50:38.998]   Biden's physician acknowledges that he likely suffered a so-called rebound infection which can affect patients taking Pfizer's Antiviral pills.
[01:50:39.058 --> 01:50:43.765]  So he took all the shots, took all the pills, and he's sick again, proving these shots are deadly.
[01:50:44.086 --> 01:50:48.092]  They're getting ready to get rid of Biden and claim that it was the virus.
[01:50:48.733 --> 01:50:50.455]  But it's their systems killing us.
[01:50:50.796 --> 01:50:51.777]  Let's start the report over.
[01:50:51.637 --> 01:50:58.637]  here it is.
[01:50:58.637 --> 01:51:03.637]  [MUSIC]
[01:51:04.037 --> 01:51:04.957]   Even though I'm just a lowly person, and aren't part of the greatest supreme homeland, people in
[01:51:04.957 --> 01:51:10.156]   black uniforms that I look up to, I'm still part of the federal family that Janet
[01:51:10.156 --> 01:51:16.197]  talks about.
[01:51:16.197 --> 01:51:17.637]  Because I snoop for them.
[01:51:18.316 --> 01:51:19.838]  And that's what America's about.
[01:51:20.318 --> 01:51:22.300]  Total schizophrenic paranoia.
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:26.663]  Absolutely thinking the terrorists are hiding under every table.
[01:51:28.627 --> 01:51:32.949]  Just think, they all look normal, but you know any of them could be a terrorist.
[01:51:34.050 --> 01:51:35.411]  Don't trust the public.
[01:51:35.711 --> 01:51:39.933]  Only trust Janet, Big Sis, Napolitano, and Homeland Security.
[01:51:41.094 --> 01:51:42.215]  That's what I've learned.
[01:51:42.975 --> 01:51:43.896]  And that's what I do.
[01:51:44.016 --> 01:51:49.719]  Yeah, it's in the Communities Against Terrorism alerts.
[01:51:50.239 --> 01:51:51.560]  They've put out hundreds of them.
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:54.882]  They say people wearing blue jeans are using cell phones of the terrorists.
[01:51:55.839 --> 01:52:06.765]  I work at a local internet cafe, coffee shop, and they told me that there were people doing stuff like trying to have privacy, or using voice over IP, or communicating through PC games.
[01:52:07.285 --> 01:52:09.286]  Man, there's nothing these terrorists won't do.
[01:52:09.726 --> 01:52:13.628]  But the number one thing they said was they use cash or credit cards.
[01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:15.709]  That's the really scary part.
[01:52:16.150 --> 01:52:24.094]  There's a lot of them come in there, a lot of them using cash, and some of them even want to be anonymous and have privacy when they surf the web.
[01:52:26.074 --> 01:52:29.977]  There's so many people using cell phones.
[01:52:31.558 --> 01:52:39.602]  There's so many people who've got screen blockers so I can't hear what they're saying.
[01:52:39.722 --> 01:52:42.124]  There's even more using cash.
[01:52:43.585 --> 01:52:44.665]  A terrorist!
[01:52:44.485 --> 01:52:48.485]   But Jan- Hold yourself together.
[01:52:48.485 --> 01:52:50.485]  You can do it.
[01:52:50.485 --> 01:52:52.485]  You can do it for America.
[01:52:52.485 --> 01:52:54.485]  Do it for Janet.
[01:52:54.485 --> 01:52:56.485]  Finally my wife needs something.
[01:52:56.485 --> 01:52:58.485]  I'm...
[01:52:58.485 --> 01:53:00.485]  The FBI now.
[01:53:00.485 --> 01:53:06.485]   Trust no one but Janet Dunn, Beetle, Napolitano.
[01:53:07.396 --> 01:53:08.256]  No one but her.
[01:53:11.579 --> 01:53:14.201]  You've always wanted to be part of an elite team.
[01:53:16.563 --> 01:53:18.325]  You got responsibilities now.
[01:53:19.985 --> 01:53:22.385]  Now get out there and start spying.
[01:53:22.385 --> 01:53:36.586]  Can we have a large house blend, please?
[01:53:36.754 --> 01:53:37.854]  Alright, let me get that for you.
[01:53:38.354 --> 01:53:40.295]  Oh yeah, he's definitely one.
[01:53:44.095 --> 01:53:49.517]  Listen, um, are you... Why are you paying cash?
[01:53:50.037 --> 01:53:51.057]  Yeah, you alright, man?
[01:53:53.072 --> 01:53:53.792]  I gotta ask you this.
[01:53:53.892 --> 01:53:55.232]  It's just a matter of national security.
[01:53:55.613 --> 01:53:56.693]  I'm an important person now.
[01:53:57.553 --> 01:53:58.853]  Is there a reason you're paying with cash?
[01:54:00.113 --> 01:54:01.574]  Uh, it's only a couple dollars.
[01:54:01.654 --> 01:54:05.915]  I just usually pay cash when it's, you know, not very much money.
[01:54:06.995 --> 01:54:07.235]  Why?
[01:54:09.395 --> 01:54:11.196]  I don't understand how that's any of your business.
[01:54:12.016 --> 01:54:14.376]  But I mean, privacy is not what America's about.
[01:54:14.456 --> 01:54:17.537]  I mean, I've gotta report you to Homeland Security.
[01:54:18.371 --> 01:54:19.151]  Are you on meds?
[01:54:20.012 --> 01:54:21.352]  No, this is the new homeland.
[01:54:22.333 --> 01:54:23.854]  The TSA sticks their hands down your pants.
[01:54:23.914 --> 01:54:27.095]  I think you're acting kind of weird.
[01:54:27.255 --> 01:54:29.796]  I just want a cup of coffee.
[01:54:30.016 --> 01:54:32.918]  With the inflation, it's actually $5 for a cup of coffee.
[01:54:32.938 --> 01:54:34.238]  Do you have some more money?
[01:54:35.819 --> 01:54:39.100]  Can I get a cup of coffee, just regular?
[01:54:39.641 --> 01:54:39.881]  Sure.
[01:54:39.921 --> 01:54:40.681]  Medium, anything else?
[01:54:41.882 --> 01:54:42.582]  I'll get a cookie too.
[01:54:42.862 --> 01:54:43.562]  You'll get a cookie?
[01:54:43.662 --> 01:54:44.623]  Alright, sure, I'll get that for you.
[01:54:46.698 --> 01:54:48.039]  God, there's a lot of terrorists.
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:50.581]  Hold on a minute, can you pay with a credit card, please?
[01:54:51.362 --> 01:54:54.924]  I don't know if I have enough in my account, so I'm just gonna pay cash.
[01:54:54.985 --> 01:54:57.907]  Actually, I have a couple 20s here, so I'm just gonna give you a 20.
[01:54:58.027 --> 01:54:59.348]  Is that cool?
[01:54:59.768 --> 01:55:03.811]  Oh my God, there's an enemy plane!
[01:55:04.112 --> 01:55:06.954]  Oh, hold on, I gotta get myself together.
[01:55:07.214 --> 01:55:08.475]  I'm Jack Bauer, Jack Bauer.
[01:55:13.459 --> 01:55:14.019]  Can you get my chain?
[01:55:16.530 --> 01:55:16.970]  Can I have that?
[01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.270]  Thanks.
[01:55:18.611 --> 01:55:18.931]  You cool?
[01:55:19.451 --> 01:55:20.171]  You're being watched.
[01:55:20.191 --> 01:55:21.872]  The homeland's keeping you safe, okay?
[01:55:22.352 --> 01:55:22.713]  By who?
[01:55:23.513 --> 01:55:24.073]  Just get out of here.
[01:55:24.093 --> 01:55:24.453]  You're lucky.
[01:55:25.514 --> 01:55:31.422]   You know, it's a pretty big boost to my ego to realize I'm I'm a good guy, because I spy on everybody.
[01:55:31.422 --> 01:55:41.422]  There he is. Oh, he's dangerous, you can tell it.
[01:55:42.045 --> 01:55:44.226]  Looks like I'm sneaking up on him, alright.
[01:55:45.207 --> 01:55:47.488]  Oh no, it's true, he's looking at Infowars.
[01:55:47.888 --> 01:55:51.970]  In fact, it says in the report that they visit extremist or radical sites.
[01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:53.230]  I gotta track him.
[01:55:53.451 --> 01:55:54.531]  I gotta do what they told me.
[01:55:58.493 --> 01:55:59.553]  I can almost hear it now.
[01:56:00.894 --> 01:56:07.894]  Oh my gosh, I'm a secret agent.
[01:56:07.894 --> 01:56:21.814]  Oh man, I'm brave.
[01:56:21.799 --> 01:56:23.340]  I'm just like those guys on TV.
[01:56:24.741 --> 01:56:25.781]  Yes, yes, FBI.
[01:56:26.141 --> 01:56:26.582]  I've got him.
[01:56:27.062 --> 01:56:27.502]  I've got him.
[01:56:28.022 --> 01:56:29.143]  He bought coffee with cash.
[01:56:30.004 --> 01:56:33.626]  And he was using a proxy server to search the web.
[01:56:34.546 --> 01:56:34.786]  Yes.
[01:56:35.547 --> 01:56:36.387]  Yes, I've got one of them.
[01:56:36.407 --> 01:56:37.368]  He's definitely a terrorist.
[01:56:41.462 --> 01:56:45.404]  The dramatization that you just witnessed is absurd.
[01:56:46.445 --> 01:56:52.268]  And it's even more absurd because it reflects reality in this country and worldwide today.
[01:56:53.069 --> 01:56:57.471]  We are 10 years into the biggest hoax in human history.
[01:56:58.051 --> 01:56:59.792]  The threat of terrorism.
[01:57:00.213 --> 01:57:02.774]  It is an irrational fear.
[01:57:02.914 --> 01:57:07.957]  It is a psychological compulsion that's been engineered into people.
[01:57:08.217 --> 01:57:11.969]   Either you're with us, Or you are with the terrorists.
[01:57:12.029 --> 01:57:13.390]  Global terrorism.
[01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:14.250]  Terrorism.
[01:57:15.511 --> 01:57:16.311]  Evil terrorists.
[01:57:16.451 --> 01:57:16.952]  Terrorists.
[01:57:17.972 --> 01:57:18.493]  Terrorists.
[01:57:19.013 --> 01:57:20.974]  Al Qaeda is still a threat.
[01:57:21.134 --> 01:57:25.477]  Many Al Qaeda groups or Al Qaeda inspired groups.
[01:57:25.617 --> 01:57:26.717]  Homegrown threat.
[01:57:26.858 --> 01:57:27.878]  Terrorist threat.
[01:57:27.898 --> 01:57:29.339]  Attacking our homeland.
[01:57:29.539 --> 01:57:37.504]  When you really pull back from a non-emotional perspective and look at this through a historical lens, you see what a hoax it is.
[01:57:38.092 --> 01:57:43.456]  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself!
[01:57:43.716 --> 01:57:46.959]  Nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror!
[01:57:47.499 --> 01:58:02.410]  It is absurd, it is ridiculous that the land of the free, home of the brave is gripped in abject fear, groveling and begging for the government to take our rights, launch wars, engage in secret arrest.
[01:58:02.530 --> 01:58:06.413]  Trillions of dollars have been spent in the last decade on anti-terrorism.
[01:58:06.793 --> 01:58:10.638]  Our entire society is converting to a domestic police state.
[01:58:10.938 --> 01:58:12.119]  Drones in the skies.
[01:58:12.540 --> 01:58:14.762]  TSA sticking their hands down your pants.
[01:58:15.103 --> 01:58:18.166]  Putting you in ionizing radiation chambers.
[01:58:18.507 --> 01:58:19.648]  The naked body scanners.
[01:58:20.369 --> 01:58:23.412]  But the system knows that it's a fraud.
[01:58:23.993 --> 01:58:28.278]  The system itself is actually engaging in terrorism.
[01:58:28.459 --> 01:58:39.953]  The truth is, government and its corporate whore media is using this hyped up threat to actually terrorize the population into giving up our basic liberties.
[01:58:40.313 --> 01:58:50.386]  And let's not forget that the former head of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge, a few years ago, even wrote a book admitting that they would issue terror alerts for political gain.
[01:58:50.786 --> 01:58:56.494]  Let's read the UN's own definition of terror that is very similar to the FBI's.
[01:58:57.847 --> 01:59:04.294]  Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public.
[01:59:04.795 --> 01:59:06.577]  There it is, hidden in plain view.
[01:59:07.158 --> 01:59:17.169]  Governments are saying, give up your rights, give us unlimited power and taxation, get behind all these wars for empire, or terrorists are going to get you.
[01:59:18.070 --> 01:59:22.792]  That itself is the very definition of terrorism.
[01:59:23.332 --> 01:59:24.973]  Now I'm going to go through some of these statistics.
[01:59:25.153 --> 01:59:32.795]  You've got a better chance of dying from a honeybee sting or falling down in your shower than you do of being killed by a terrorist.
[01:59:33.236 --> 01:59:45.688]   You have a much better chance of dying water skiing Or swimming in your pool, or slipping in your bathtub, or a deer jumping out in front of you, and having a car wreck and dying, than you do from terrorists.
[01:59:45.948 --> 01:59:46.949]  The numbers are all there.
[01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:52.376]  Even Scientific American, a few years ago, did a big breakdown on this.
[01:59:52.676 --> 01:59:53.697]  Let's just look at the numbers.
[01:59:54.318 --> 02:00:00.806]  You've got a 1 in 540 chance each and every year of developing fatal cancer.
[02:00:01.347 --> 02:00:08.736]  If you look at the wars launched in the name of fighting terrorists, in the case of Iraq, the Iraqis had a 1 in 1,150 chance of dying.
[02:00:11.539 --> 02:00:12.899]  Let's look at traffic accidents.
[02:00:13.340 --> 02:00:18.221]  In the year 2008, you had a 1 in 8,000 chance of dying in a car wreck.
[02:00:18.521 --> 02:00:20.102]  Homicide in the United States.
[02:00:20.502 --> 02:00:23.923]  You had a 1 in 22,000 times chance of dying.
[02:00:24.223 --> 02:00:26.384]  Let's take terrorism in Northern Ireland.
[02:00:26.724 --> 02:00:31.306]  During that entire conflict from 1970 to 2007, you had a 1 in 43,000 chance of being killed.
[02:00:35.427 --> 02:00:48.355]  If you take all terrorism in the United States from 1970 to 2007, you had a 1 in 3.5 million chance of being killed by a terrorist.
[02:00:48.895 --> 02:00:55.159]  And remember, many of those terrorist attacks were actually staged or provocateured to take your freedom.
[02:00:55.879 --> 02:00:59.062]  We're not just going to show you the fake threat of terror.
[02:00:59.683 --> 02:01:03.286]  We're going to show you the real threats to human society.
[02:01:03.806 --> 02:01:11.994]  And we're going to expose the number one killer of human beings in the last 100 years.
[02:01:12.735 --> 02:01:18.420]  This information that you're about to see could save billions of lives.
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:28.984]   And in every case, These threats flow from the global technocratic elite and their scientific dictatorship.
[02:01:29.004 --> 02:01:30.986]  Is that guests?
[02:01:32.387 --> 02:01:35.229]  And it's not just that the elite are a threat to the general public.
[02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:38.191]  I've analyzed this thing from one end to the other.
[02:01:38.811 --> 02:01:40.872]  They're the greatest threat to themselves.
[02:01:41.752 --> 02:01:45.113]  But wasn't that the case with Hitler turning East into Russia?
[02:01:45.873 --> 02:01:46.654]  Or Napoleon?
[02:01:47.034 --> 02:01:48.274]  Or even Julius Caesar?
[02:01:49.075 --> 02:01:56.177]  It's the fact that they're so arrogant, so filled with bravada and chutzpah, that they think they're God.
[02:01:57.237 --> 02:02:05.200]  These control freaks are going to bring themselves down, and all the rest of us with them, if we don't wake up and stop them.
[02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:15.506]   Of all the real proven threats to humanity, none of them ...have killed as many people as government itself.
[02:02:16.186 --> 02:02:19.308]  In academia, it's known as democide.
[02:02:20.069 --> 02:02:24.072]  But notice, you've probably never heard that, even if you went to college.
[02:02:24.752 --> 02:02:28.075]  And you've certainly never seen it on the news, or on the Discovery Channel.
[02:02:28.951 --> 02:02:36.978]  Oh no, they're too busy telling you about sharks they're gonna get you any minute with Shark Week and Bin Laden and we gotta stick our hands down your pants.
[02:02:37.679 --> 02:02:40.101]  No, you never hear about Demoscite.
[02:02:40.542 --> 02:02:48.529]  And it's proven, it's on record, that governments have killed over 260 million people.
[02:02:48.829 --> 02:02:50.090]  It's a giant number.
[02:02:50.951 --> 02:02:53.773]  So big that it's even hard to grasp.
[02:02:54.659 --> 02:03:02.087]  That is the number one cause of unnatural death in the 20th and now 21st century.
[02:03:02.107 --> 02:03:07.112]  And if you look back at the eons before that, it was always number one.
[02:03:07.453 --> 02:03:09.395]  Look what George Washington and many others said.
[02:03:10.450 --> 02:03:12.372]  Government is like fire.
[02:03:12.732 --> 02:03:15.935]  It is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[02:03:16.635 --> 02:03:20.238]  You bet it is.
[02:03:20.258 --> 02:03:22.580]  260 plus million dead.
[02:03:23.321 --> 02:03:24.221]  Democide.
[02:03:24.942 --> 02:03:26.664]  When your government kills you.
[02:03:27.324 --> 02:03:37.092]  To put Democide into perspective, it would take 10 sports stadiums, jam-packed with 100,000 people apiece, to represent 1 million souls.
[02:03:37.813 --> 02:03:46.339]  China, from 1949 to 1987, the Communist Party killed 76 plus million people.
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:47.921]  And they even admit it.
[02:03:48.261 --> 02:03:48.982]  They're proud of it.
[02:03:49.542 --> 02:03:56.968]  The USSR from 1917 to 1987 killed over 61 million people.
[02:03:57.849 --> 02:04:03.514]  Combined Western colonialism killed over 50 million people.
[02:04:04.314 --> 02:04:14.483]  Germany under Hitler from 1933 to 1945 killed more than 20 million people total, including their own population.
[02:04:15.163 --> 02:04:22.608]  Japan, during its imperial orgy from 1936 to 1945, killed five plus million people.
[02:04:22.928 --> 02:04:29.672]  Before Mao even got into power from 1923 to 1948, they killed right around three and a half million.
[02:04:30.013 --> 02:04:33.815]  And good old Pol Pot in Cambodia, funded by the U.S.
[02:04:33.855 --> 02:04:37.097]  government and Zbigniew Brzezinski, from 1975 to 1979, killed around 30% of his population.
[02:04:37.117 --> 02:04:45.516]   the 1979 killed around 30 percent of his population 2 million turkey during their genocide of the Armenians
[02:04:46.342 --> 02:04:46.882]  Vietnam, 1.67 million.
[02:04:47.062 --> 02:04:48.102]  Poland, 1.585 million.
[02:04:48.142 --> 02:04:49.042]  Pakistan, 1.5 plus million.
[02:04:49.062 --> 02:04:50.343]  Yugoslavia under Tito, 1,072,000.
[02:04:50.443 --> 02:04:52.223]  And the mega murder just continues.
[02:04:52.243 --> 02:04:53.023]  North Korea, 1.663 million.
[02:04:53.363 --> 02:05:00.363]  Pakistan 1.5 plus million. Yugoslavia under Tito 1,072,000.
[02:05:00.363 --> 02:05:03.363]  And the mega murder just continues.
[02:05:03.363 --> 02:05:06.363]  North Korea 1.663 million.
[02:05:06.363 --> 02:05:10.363]  Mexico 1,417,000.
[02:05:10.363 --> 02:05:14.363]   Russia before the communist even got in killed over 1 million.
[02:05:15.092 --> 02:05:18.116]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[02:05:18.576 --> 02:05:23.843]  For a whopping conservative total of 262 million.
[02:05:25.004 --> 02:05:27.247]  Governments winning the war against humanity.
[02:05:27.928 --> 02:05:29.029]  And let me just be clear.
[02:05:30.014 --> 02:05:32.655]  That's governments killing unarmed civilians.
[02:05:33.196 --> 02:05:36.297]  That doesn't even count military casualties.
[02:05:36.817 --> 02:05:41.460]  If you add those in, it's well over 350 million.
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:06:01.110]   So, democide, or death by government, is the number one threat, because it's already been carried out many, many times, and governments all over the world are engaging in mass murder right now, and our own government, under the National Defense Authorization Act, ...is openly stating that they will kill U.S.
[02:06:01.150 --> 02:06:03.593]  citizens, secretly arrest U.S.
[02:06:03.653 --> 02:06:07.877]  citizens, and have us disappear into secret prisons and black holes.
[02:06:08.358 --> 02:06:11.401]  So the gauntlet has been thrown down in front of us.
[02:06:12.201 --> 02:06:16.265]  You've seen how governments have overtly killed their populations.
[02:06:17.349 --> 02:06:20.572]  By the sword, by the gun, by starvation.
[02:06:21.312 --> 02:06:24.635]  But what about covert forms of genocide?
[02:06:25.316 --> 02:06:27.437]  We're now going to look at that area.
[02:06:28.198 --> 02:06:36.205]  And then I'll get into the mad scientist activity of the global rulers who are trying to basically become God.
[02:06:37.205 --> 02:06:39.407]  Throughout history there have been two major movements.
[02:06:40.068 --> 02:06:49.354]   Those that are promoting and pushing for human liberty, And for empowering humanity and those that seek to dominate and control it.
[02:06:50.354 --> 02:06:56.797]  Now, a pseudoscience developed around 1850 in the United Kingdom called eugenics.
[02:06:57.517 --> 02:07:02.119]  And the spinoff of that, of course, was the Nazis and their race purification program.
[02:07:03.052 --> 02:07:11.439]  But eugenics was funded by the British royal family and was basically just a regurgitation of what royalty had already believed for thousands of years.
[02:07:11.839 --> 02:07:13.801]  That they were divine.
[02:07:14.261 --> 02:07:16.803]  That they had a divine right of kings.
[02:07:17.364 --> 02:07:22.108]  And that they had a right to enslave, dominate, and kill populations.
[02:07:23.971 --> 02:07:32.598]  As liberty grew worldwide, governments began to develop covert means to control populations and to exterminate them.
[02:07:33.039 --> 02:07:40.184]  And that's what many famous eugenicists, including Nobel Prize winners, have written about and talked about, like Bertrand Russell.
[02:07:41.165 --> 02:07:52.495]  Diet injections and injunctions will combine from a very early age to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable.
[02:07:53.439 --> 02:07:58.524]  And any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible.
[02:07:59.124 --> 02:07:59.945]  Bertrand Russell.
[02:08:01.226 --> 02:08:12.417]  You can go back to the 1920s and 30s and they obsess on putting chemicals in our food, in our water to make us less aggressive, more docile, to dumb us down so we will submit.
[02:08:12.777 --> 02:08:18.122]  What's so frustrating about these covert programs at population reduction is that they're not really covert.
[02:08:18.923 --> 02:08:23.066]  Sure, it's not on the nightly news, but it's all hidden in plain view.
[02:08:23.626 --> 02:08:35.754]  You know about the experimentation on black men, injecting them with syphilis, and Tuskegee experiment, and plague bomb test off the coast of Scotland, and all of England being sprayed with biologicals.
[02:08:36.295 --> 02:08:48.423]  Or Henry Kissinger in the 1970s, putting out US policy State Department Memorandum 200, that called for using food and war as a weapon to reduce populations in the third world.
[02:08:48.963 --> 02:08:50.765]  It is so diabolical.
[02:08:51.386 --> 02:08:58.353]  This corporatist world government is built and based on reducing population.
[02:08:58.993 --> 02:09:02.057]  And it's in the British Population Commission documents of 1949.
[02:09:02.097 --> 02:09:14.868]   White House science czar John P. Holdren wrote in the 1970s that they should develop Covert chemicals in the water to reduce fertility and the population.
[02:09:15.069 --> 02:09:15.789]  It's amazing.
[02:09:16.129 --> 02:09:32.756]   They admit that they're establishing a global corporate government to carry out genocide covertly through vaccines, through sodium fluoride, through sterilants like bisphenol A, aspartame, The list goes on and on.
[02:09:33.196 --> 02:09:38.798]  It is all meant to poison and debilitate and reduce our fertility.
[02:09:39.278 --> 02:09:41.598]  That's why cancer rates have skyrocketed.
[02:09:41.959 --> 02:09:47.020]  That's why the United States has the highest rate of cancer, diabetes, neurological disorders.
[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:50.201]  It's all being beta tested here.
[02:09:51.141 --> 02:09:59.423]  World government is being established as a straitjacket on the planet so the globalists can carry out genocide.
[02:10:00.305 --> 02:10:02.186]  And it's not fair to call them Nazis.
[02:10:03.026 --> 02:10:06.968]  The Nazis just moved too quickly and were exposed.
[02:10:07.769 --> 02:10:11.050]  It's not fair to call them Nazis, because they're worse than Nazis.
[02:10:11.651 --> 02:10:23.636]  They are the progenitors of the Nazi idea, but they're patient, they're calm, they pose as philanthropists, but they can't control themselves sometimes.
[02:10:24.037 --> 02:10:31.140]   That's why Bill Gates, whose father was the head of Planned Parenthood and a known eugenicist, Has admitted he wants to reduce population.
[02:10:31.541 --> 02:10:34.142]  And that's what his foundation is really all about.
[02:10:34.603 --> 02:10:38.305]  He's bragged about get rid of a grandma and hire ten teachers.
[02:10:38.525 --> 02:10:42.328]  He's spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient.
[02:10:43.008 --> 02:10:50.073]  Would it be better not to lay off those ten teachers and to make that trade off in medical costs?
[02:10:50.113 --> 02:10:51.694]  But that's called the death panel.
[02:10:52.635 --> 02:10:54.196]  And you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[02:10:54.844 --> 02:10:59.206]  He's come out and said, give people vaccines to reduce population.
[02:10:59.506 --> 02:11:02.487]  So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero.
[02:11:02.827 --> 02:11:05.868]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[02:11:06.808 --> 02:11:09.409]  Now that's back from high school algebra.
[02:11:09.429 --> 02:11:10.590]  But let's take a look.
[02:11:11.670 --> 02:11:13.110]  First we've got population.
[02:11:13.751 --> 02:11:22.114]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[02:11:23.254 --> 02:11:30.799]  It is so incredibly disgusting, and he's now the number one funder of GMO crops being developed across the world.
[02:11:31.359 --> 02:11:55.552]   And in every study that's been done of GMO crops across the board, they massively reduce fertility in the first generation of rats and guinea pigs, and other rodents like rabbits, and within three generations, near total sterility and bizarre deformities Shriveled sexual organs, hair growing in the mouth, it is beyond bizarre.
[02:11:55.992 --> 02:12:02.094]  Those that ate the genetically engineered soy, they didn't actually show the problems in the first generation.
[02:12:02.795 --> 02:12:09.837]  The second generation was slower growth, slower onset for maturity, but by the third generation, that's when the boom hit.
[02:12:09.877 --> 02:12:14.979]  And that was when nearly all of the adults had lost the ability to have babies.
[02:12:15.970 --> 02:12:20.257]  And then we look at Monsanto that Bill Gates is the major owner of.
[02:12:21.199 --> 02:12:24.004]  The same folks that gave us Agent Orange and you name it.
[02:12:24.662 --> 02:12:31.246]  And we learned that in their own cafeteria, in their own restaurants and cantinas, there is no GMO.
[02:12:32.106 --> 02:12:43.633]  And then we learned Bill Gates and the Rockefeller Foundation are building underground seed vaults of uninfected non-GMO seeds all over the world at the Arctic Circle and other areas.
[02:12:44.013 --> 02:12:48.896]  They are obsessed with giant farms that produce all the food they eat.
[02:12:49.317 --> 02:12:51.358]  The cattle are only fed organics.
[02:12:52.591 --> 02:12:59.531]  That is then shipped around the world, no matter where they go, their own private chefs prepare their food.
[02:13:00.418 --> 02:13:01.158]  But it gets worse.
[02:13:01.819 --> 02:13:11.025]  Monsanto, who's gotten their people in all the regulatory positions, is coming out with new federal regs that you can't even be told when you're being fed GMO.
[02:13:11.405 --> 02:13:15.127]  It's designed to sterilize you and basically give you organ failure and cancer.
[02:13:15.428 --> 02:13:20.951]  So, they won't eat it in their own Monsanto restaurants at their facilities.
[02:13:21.592 --> 02:13:22.632]  And Bill Gates won't eat it.
[02:13:22.952 --> 02:13:25.674]  And the Queen of England, who's a known eugenicist, won't eat it.
[02:13:25.934 --> 02:13:29.377]  And Prince Philip, who says he wants 80% of you dead, he won't eat it.
[02:13:30.137 --> 02:13:39.243]  If I were reincarnated, I would wish to be returned to this Earth as a killer virus to lower human population levels.
[02:13:39.863 --> 02:13:40.724]  Prince Philip.
[02:13:41.424 --> 02:13:44.867]  The Queen of England is obsessed with organic raw milk.
[02:13:45.247 --> 02:13:52.151]  But in the United States and Canada and England, they're persecuting Amish and others that are producing it and selling it to their neighbors.
[02:13:52.492 --> 02:13:54.333]  And the Communist Chinese leadership.
[02:13:54.873 --> 02:14:02.597]  ...who publicly signed on to a eugenics program with The Globalist to reduce their population in exchange for development.
[02:14:03.318 --> 02:14:14.264]  Their inner party chiefs are obsessed on record with nothing but pure organic food while they force GMO on their population.
[02:14:14.864 --> 02:14:17.986]  It is all about sterilizing the population.
[02:14:19.541 --> 02:14:21.683]  And the graphs and the numbers don't lie.
[02:14:22.063 --> 02:14:33.791]  They are building Trojan Horse, Fertility, Reduction, Sterilance, and Cancer Trigger systems into all of the GMO and carrying out a covert genocide program.
[02:14:34.231 --> 02:14:40.876]  There are so many other examples of the elite poisoning us while doing everything they can to avoid their own garbage.
[02:14:41.136 --> 02:14:42.737]  But I'll give you just one more example here.
[02:14:43.297 --> 02:14:44.618]  And that's Germany.
[02:14:45.138 --> 02:14:46.759]  And of course this is going on all over the world.
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:15:01.119]   It came out a few years ago that The German government and the top military brass were refusing to take the H1N1 shot, so Big Pharma produced a, quote, clean or safe vaccine for them.
[02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:03.603]  And of course it did come out, the H1N1 vaccines.
[02:15:05.345 --> 02:15:13.477]  Did have other RNA added to it and other viruses and basically was just a Trojan horse for population reduction.
[02:15:13.978 --> 02:15:20.568]  And there have now been many other vaccine trials that have come out that are actually killing homeless people in the test and even newborn children.
[02:15:20.988 --> 02:15:27.596]  I saw reports a decade ago where the CDC had a secret meeting and Congress demanded the documents.
[02:15:27.616 --> 02:15:28.617]  That's why we now have them.
[02:15:29.057 --> 02:15:33.803]  And the leadership of the CDC was saying, tell your families don't take the vaccines.
[02:15:34.123 --> 02:15:37.326]  It's causing brain damage, but don't tell the public.
[02:15:37.927 --> 02:15:42.431]  They learned when Hitler had guys in black uniforms out there shooting people in pits.
[02:15:42.751 --> 02:15:43.892]  That was a little too obvious.
[02:15:44.492 --> 02:15:46.234]  Now they just soft kill you.
[02:15:46.594 --> 02:15:51.658]  And then you go to one of these big Rockefeller controlled hospitals and they suck all your savings out of you.
[02:15:51.758 --> 02:15:59.066]   And the globalists have even told us diet injections and injunctions will bring us Under the heel of the globalist.
[02:15:59.826 --> 02:16:01.408]  Our species is incredible.
[02:16:01.448 --> 02:16:10.533]  We're dynamic creatures that created space travel and classical music and literature and poetry and film.
[02:16:11.154 --> 02:16:23.122]  And these globalist psycho dirtbags now control the media and teach us how bad children are, how pathetic we are, how we're scum, how we have no heroes, how there's no good guys.
[02:16:23.422 --> 02:16:26.204]  So we'll just roll over and give the world to them.
[02:16:26.664 --> 02:16:27.905]  It's truly disgusting.
[02:16:28.526 --> 02:16:44.781]  The ultimate power trip by Ted Turner, Bill Gates, David Rockefeller, people like George Soros, Oprah Winfrey, meeting in secret in New York to talk about ways to forcibly reduce population.
[02:16:45.802 --> 02:16:48.625]  And then when the article did leak out, they tried to have it suppressed.
[02:16:49.975 --> 02:16:53.378]  That much money, that much power around one table.
[02:16:53.758 --> 02:16:56.081]  It begs the question, what were they doing?
[02:16:56.261 --> 02:16:57.602]  What were they scheming?
[02:16:57.922 --> 02:16:59.303]  Total world domination?
[02:16:59.724 --> 02:17:03.407]  This group, together for six hours, was talking about charity.
[02:17:03.908 --> 02:17:06.750]  Education, emergency relief, global health.
[02:17:06.970 --> 02:17:15.198]  The very people that talk about how they want to kill us all day, run the global programs to make sure our kids get extra vaccines and eat GMO.
[02:17:16.641 --> 02:17:18.142]  It doesn't get any more obvious.
[02:17:18.462 --> 02:17:20.243]  This isn't 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[02:17:20.963 --> 02:17:22.464]  This is 1 plus 1 equals 2.
[02:17:22.544 --> 02:17:26.306]  This is so ridiculously obvious.
[02:17:26.967 --> 02:17:34.951]  It was the eugenicist, population reductionist Adolf Hitler who said, the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it.
[02:17:36.237 --> 02:17:41.961]  When I first read that as a teenager, I didn't understand it, but as I've learned more, I realize how true that is.
[02:17:42.701 --> 02:17:57.912]  Once you tell a giant lie, from a position of authority, like David Rockefeller, or Ted Turner, or Bill Gates, and once the politicians and the general public go along with your lie, they've now all signed on to it, and they give power to the lie.
[02:17:58.192 --> 02:18:00.534]  Is there a connection with autism, for example?
[02:18:01.124 --> 02:18:05.413]  Well, Dr. Wakefield has been shown to use absolutely fraudulent data.
[02:18:05.834 --> 02:18:08.299]  He had a financial interest in some lawsuits.
[02:18:08.339 --> 02:18:10.002]  He created a fake paper.
[02:18:10.042 --> 02:18:11.225]  The journal allowed it to run.
[02:18:12.285 --> 02:18:17.350]  All the other studies were done showed no connection whatsoever again and again and again.
[02:18:18.692 --> 02:18:23.176]  And so it's an absolute lie that has killed thousands of kids.
[02:18:23.256 --> 02:18:36.529]  And it's then very hard to reverse that lie because it's got so much momentum and such a great weight because the public is taught that if they ever stand up to the lie it'll bring down the whole house of cards.
[02:18:37.645 --> 02:18:40.146]  My friends, we need to bring down this house of cards.
[02:18:40.786 --> 02:18:42.827]  If it doesn't come down, we're ruined.
[02:18:43.668 --> 02:18:45.408]  Most of us are already walking dead.
[02:18:45.909 --> 02:18:48.510]  We were born being fed deadly fluoride.
[02:18:48.550 --> 02:18:49.810]  We had our IQs reduced.
[02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:52.031]  We were shot up with dangerous vaccines.
[02:18:52.352 --> 02:18:53.572]  We've been fed GMO.
[02:18:53.972 --> 02:19:04.217]  It's almost impossible to stay away from it, unless you're some billionaire who has their own private farms and ranches and private chefs that fly around behind you, preparing your meals.
[02:19:06.049 --> 02:19:09.432]  The only way to defeat these people is to realize it is a big lie.
[02:19:09.993 --> 02:19:11.074]  It is a giant hoax.
[02:19:11.454 --> 02:19:14.037]  And to read their own arrogant statements.
[02:19:14.938 --> 02:19:25.228]  If a black death could be spread throughout the world, once in every generation, survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full.
[02:19:25.949 --> 02:19:26.850]  Bertrand Russell.
[02:19:27.770 --> 02:19:29.993]  Talk about sick control freaks.
[02:19:31.121 --> 02:19:40.923]  Who hate humanity so much that they spend their every waking minute trying to think of ways to set up a global government so they can exterminate us and our families.
[02:19:41.684 --> 02:19:42.604]  My God!
[02:19:43.064 --> 02:19:51.646]  And their plan is so horrific, they think we're too weak-minded to face what they've admittedly been caught doing and to resist them.
[02:19:52.978 --> 02:19:55.019]  Are you pathetic scum that deserves to die?
[02:19:55.759 --> 02:19:56.940]  Are you going to prove them right?
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:19:58.440]  It's up to you.
[02:19:58.980 --> 02:20:03.622]  The globalists have been so arrogant that they've not even hidden any of their designs.
[02:20:04.522 --> 02:20:09.204]  They think that it's so horrific that we'll just let them get away with what they're doing.
[02:20:10.204 --> 02:20:12.225]  Are we smart enough to learn from history?
[02:20:12.505 --> 02:20:16.627]  Government is the number one cause of unnatural death throughout all of human history.
[02:20:17.247 --> 02:20:21.769]  Government tends to be taken over by psychopaths who are completely ruthless.
[02:20:22.679 --> 02:20:31.414]  Good people tend to stand down and let the psychopaths do whatever they want to them simply because they are the authorities.
[02:20:33.697 --> 02:20:40.379]  But the technocratic eugenics social engineers are not content to just soft-kill the population.
[02:20:41.259 --> 02:21:00.045]  All across the Western world, from Australia to the United States, government-funded universities have been developing Level 4 super-weaponized viruses and bacteria that kill over 90% of the mammals that come in contact with it.
[02:21:00.825 --> 02:21:05.248]  That's more than 9 out of 10 people on your street dead.
[02:21:05.828 --> 02:21:07.529]  Weaponized airborne Ebola.
[02:21:08.010 --> 02:21:12.052]  Weaponized airborne mousepox that can be designed for humans.
[02:21:12.553 --> 02:21:15.315]  Weaponized airborne smallpox.
[02:21:15.735 --> 02:21:17.956]  Weaponized airborne bird flu.
[02:21:18.757 --> 02:21:20.798]  Weaponized airborne H1N1.
[02:21:21.218 --> 02:21:29.164]  Our own government dug up dead whalers who died of the Spanish flu that killed more than 40 million people.
[02:21:29.963 --> 02:21:34.505]  And they've dug up the original bubonic plague and replicated it.
[02:21:34.965 --> 02:21:40.308]  They've taken every disease ever seen in history and souped it up.
[02:21:41.028 --> 02:21:53.534]  And they're now developing massive storehouses of these weapons in the name of bio-defense under the BioShield program and storing them in level 1, 2, and 3 facilities.
[02:21:55.950 --> 02:21:57.271]  Let me put this in layman terms.
[02:21:58.212 --> 02:22:16.552]  A level four bioweapons lab should be three floors under the ground, barbed wire fences, minefields, and machine guns, and a system that if the superb germs get out, they pull a lever, alarms go off, and the whole place goes up in flames.
[02:22:17.588 --> 02:22:29.978]  But instead, the global elite are storing it in level 2 facilities, like the University of Texas at Galveston, behind a glass door with a swipe guard, right there in Petri dishes.
[02:22:30.819 --> 02:22:37.765]  And they're doing this so that when they release it to massively reduce population, they can claim it was an accident.
[02:22:38.635 --> 02:22:53.192]  This is one of the biggest threats we face is the fact that these eugenicists that run our governments have produced literally hundreds of super weapons and are just waiting until they've got their police state grid in place to release them.
[02:22:54.158 --> 02:22:59.604]  There are countless other examples of government weapons programs that endanger our planet.
[02:23:00.164 --> 02:23:01.726]  You know about nuclear weapons.
[02:23:01.786 --> 02:23:08.433]  You know about systems that kill all the life but leave the buildings in place, like the neutron bomb.
[02:23:09.014 --> 02:23:16.221]  But then, of course, there's also race-specific bioweapons that people like Dick Cheney talked about in the PNAC documents.
[02:23:17.253 --> 02:23:22.755]  Weapons that kill certain racial types and leave everyone else alive.
[02:23:23.736 --> 02:23:28.638]  In fact, it's possible that a weapon could be released and only Asians would live.
[02:23:28.978 --> 02:23:33.000]  Or a weapon could be released and only people of Northern European...
[02:23:33.940 --> 02:23:35.322]  Derivation would survive.
[02:23:35.822 --> 02:23:43.871]  Our weapons could be released where only people of Semitic background are killed or people of Semitic background survive.
[02:23:44.411 --> 02:23:47.555]  These systems have been developed and are on record.
[02:23:48.175 --> 02:24:00.190]   But getting back into nuclear weapons, The Air Force has admitted they've been testing and trying to develop things like anti-matter bombs that could actually destroy the entire planet.
[02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:14.381]  And yes, scientists at CERN have come out and said, well, there's a low probability that we'll create a black hole that destroys the Earth, or a strangelet, or a particle that sinks to the center of the Earth and then causes the planet to implode.
[02:24:15.522 --> 02:24:16.483]  My problem is this.
[02:24:17.762 --> 02:24:20.325]  The globalists have shown that they think they're God, but they're not.
[02:24:20.385 --> 02:24:36.942]  They're very reckless, they're full of bravado and chutzpah, and we now have hundreds of nuclear reactors in the world that are close to 40 years old or older, which are now literally rotting, and 9 out of 10 reactors are now reportedly leaking radiation.
[02:24:37.422 --> 02:24:39.622]  and the elite just doesn't care.
[02:24:39.622 --> 02:24:45.221]   You know, a great example of this was in the 1940s when they first tested the first A-bomb.
[02:24:45.221 --> 02:24:49.521]   Many of the scientists thought that it could ignite the world's atmosphere
[02:24:49.521 --> 02:24:53.122]  and kill the habitability of our planet.
[02:24:53.122 --> 02:24:56.121]  Thank God it didn't ignite the atmosphere.
[02:24:56.121 --> 02:25:05.121]   But the point is, they still went ahead with the test in their search for godlike powers.
[02:25:05.121 --> 02:25:09.121]  Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.
[02:25:10.122 --> 02:25:11.622]  One... Two...
[02:25:11.622 --> 02:25:13.961]  (explosion)
[02:25:13.961 --> 02:25:16.882]  (thunder rumbling)
[02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:20.412]  And in their own words said, we have become Shiva, the destroyer.
[02:25:20.812 --> 02:25:23.014]  We have become Kali, the god of death.
[02:25:23.554 --> 02:25:27.756]  We are going to take on these powers even if it destroys us.
[02:25:28.137 --> 02:25:39.403]  A few decades later, the United States had tested more than a hundred high-power hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere and in the Van Allen radiation belt.
[02:25:40.644 --> 02:25:44.386]  The Air Force wanted to see if they could blow up the atmosphere.
[02:25:45.227 --> 02:25:45.507]  Again.
[02:25:46.837 --> 02:25:51.579]  They tell us all they give up our liberties because somebody might detonate a car bomb.
[02:25:52.099 --> 02:26:01.643]  But meanwhile, they're firing hydrogen nuclear weapons into the upper atmosphere in an attempt, in their own words, to blow a hole in the atmosphere.
[02:26:02.583 --> 02:26:09.712]  I interviewed years ago the director of HAARP, and he admitted that they're able to ignite the atmosphere with this system.
[02:26:10.392 --> 02:26:15.779]  Our whole world has become a giant experiment by mad scientists.
[02:26:16.319 --> 02:26:18.862]  This presentation is only a small part of the evidence.
[02:26:19.443 --> 02:26:22.386]  Unfortunately, the facts are incontrovertible.
[02:26:23.479 --> 02:26:32.907]  We have a group of mad scientists who believe that they are supermen in a race separate from general humanity playing God.
[02:26:33.848 --> 02:26:37.892]  One reason the globalists are so arrogant is that they've got advanced technology.
[02:26:38.252 --> 02:26:40.674]  They've been suppressing what's been doled out of the public.
[02:26:40.794 --> 02:26:43.537]  So they think they can control all of these systems.
[02:26:45.327 --> 02:26:46.408]  None of this is new.
[02:26:47.169 --> 02:26:54.255]  If you go back to every ancient civilization, the elites believed that they were God and the general population was scum.
[02:26:55.438 --> 02:27:00.622]  And the longer a dynasty went, the more decadent and crazy it got.
[02:27:01.063 --> 02:27:04.826]  The more the elites began to believe that they were infallible in God.
[02:27:05.586 --> 02:27:12.312]  And it's this same incredible hubris that is endangering our civilization today.
[02:27:13.033 --> 02:27:15.635]  You have all these elite families interbreeding.
[02:27:16.394 --> 02:27:21.376]  ...with their aggressive genes, their psychopathic genes, their sociopathic genes.
[02:27:22.176 --> 02:27:35.140]  And then philosophers and scientists come along, like Thomas Malthus 200 and something years ago in England, and says, oh, let's bring back the plague, let's give people diseases, let's reduce population.
[02:27:35.740 --> 02:27:45.910]  And then you see every other major British scientist, and then German, Russian, US scientist, since then, who's into eugenics saying Malthus was right.
[02:27:46.431 --> 02:27:47.832]  Let's promote the plague.
[02:27:48.193 --> 02:27:49.894]  Let's kill the general public.
[02:27:49.914 --> 02:27:52.076]  And then you've got these inbred elites.
[02:27:53.237 --> 02:27:56.058]  Who are into all this stuff going, absolutely, let's do it!
[02:27:56.538 --> 02:28:01.679]  And then you find out, they're putting stuff in our vaccines, our food, our water.
[02:28:01.999 --> 02:28:08.941]  They're engineering Trojan horse genetic traits into food that are causing organ failure and sterility.
[02:28:09.561 --> 02:28:14.083]  And you realize that a bunch of crazy psychos are in control.
[02:28:14.383 --> 02:28:15.763]  But I'll tell you what's even crazier.
[02:28:16.603 --> 02:28:18.704]  These psychopaths aren't even in control.
[02:28:20.219 --> 02:28:29.623]  They are so arrogant and think they're so invincible that they've got thousands of laboratories splicing every plant and animal you can imagine.
[02:28:30.183 --> 02:28:32.704]  Monkeys that have got five or six other species.
[02:28:33.245 --> 02:28:34.785]  Fish that have got insects in them.
[02:28:35.145 --> 02:28:40.988]  You name it, it's just pell-mell, helter-skelter, petal-to-the-metal wild.
[02:28:42.765 --> 02:28:46.269]  If we don't turn this around, we face a nightmare scenario.
[02:28:46.649 --> 02:28:49.392]  The globalists are already trying to start World War III right now.
[02:28:49.672 --> 02:28:54.657]  They're funding tens of billions of dollars for 30,000 drones in the skies over America.
[02:28:55.438 --> 02:29:00.143]  They've got neighborhood watch groups now spying on their neighbors for their political speech.
[02:29:01.963 --> 02:29:04.866]  It's getting more and more Twilight Zone by the minute.
[02:29:05.647 --> 02:29:08.129]  Let's rediscover the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:29:08.430 --> 02:29:11.012]  Let's rediscover common sense, basic liberty.
[02:29:11.513 --> 02:29:13.715]  Let's protect individual rights.
[02:29:14.636 --> 02:29:17.319]  Let's get the globalist controllers under control.
[02:29:18.558 --> 02:29:21.200]  Let's point out that they're a bunch of lunatics.
[02:29:21.781 --> 02:29:27.105]  Let's stop buying into their whole Madison Avenue, Wall Street, Hollywood false reality.
[02:29:27.385 --> 02:29:33.250]  Let's rise above their control paradigm and really see it for what it is and call it out.
[02:29:33.971 --> 02:29:38.095]  You can't fight this system from within anymore.
[02:29:38.795 --> 02:29:42.578]  You gotta realize, this house of cards is already coming down.
[02:29:43.058 --> 02:29:50.183]  And the only way to save our civilization, our species, our society, is to face just how dire our straits are.
[02:29:50.843 --> 02:29:55.126]  All I want is for our species to continue.
[02:29:55.686 --> 02:30:14.393]   All I want is prosperity for our progeny, our great-great-grandchildren, to be able to live in peace, And explore space, and be successful, and look back on the trials and tribulations we went through as an example for the trials and tribulations they're gonna face.
[02:30:15.333 --> 02:30:23.335]  I mean, the level of corruption and flat-out demonic evil that we're putting up with is just ridiculous.
[02:30:24.155 --> 02:30:25.836]  We're at the crossroads, my friends.
[02:30:26.575 --> 02:30:32.575]  Our future, our destiny, our very existence is up to you.
[02:30:32.575 --> 02:30:49.575]   It is surreal to actually be living inside the New World Order.
[02:30:50.508 --> 02:30:58.014]  It is bizarre to read all their white papers and battle plans from 50, 60, 70 years ago and now to see it all being implemented.
[02:30:59.095 --> 02:31:06.220]  What's truly horrifying is we know what their battle plans call for in the next phase, a 90% foresty population on the planet.
[02:31:07.161 --> 02:31:14.902]   They have recruited an army of control freaks and pedophiles and scum and criminals of every sort to build their new
[02:31:14.902 --> 02:31:15.733]  world order army.
[02:31:15.733 --> 02:31:19.572]   And they have the big private central banks and their funding, they have the corporate
[02:31:19.572 --> 02:31:21.092]  media, they have most of the courts.
[02:31:21.092 --> 02:31:24.172]  But they don't have our hearts, our minds.
[02:31:24.172 --> 02:31:27.572]  And they don't have control of your soul.
[02:31:27.572 --> 02:31:31.572]   If we simply realize that God is the answer and reach out to God to give us discernment,
[02:31:31.572 --> 02:31:33.853]  to lead God and direct us, we are unstoppable together.
[02:31:34.474 --> 02:31:37.298]  Now, InfoWars is under unprecedented globalist attack.
[02:31:37.338 --> 02:31:40.261]  I'm quite frankly proud of it even though it's very daunting.
[02:31:40.561 --> 02:31:43.665]  But I know I have the living God inside my soul.
[02:31:44.406 --> 02:31:46.889]  I have the power of the overcomer inside of me and so do you.
[02:31:46.909 --> 02:31:47.670]  We're going to win this.
[02:31:48.786 --> 02:31:59.068]  If we just continue to resist the tyrants, not because we hate these evil people, but because we love our children and we love the innocents that are counting on us to stand up and speak out and fight back.
[02:31:59.388 --> 02:32:00.869]  Now, the cavalry's here.
[02:32:00.949 --> 02:32:02.689]  So many of our best-selling products have been sold out.
[02:32:03.209 --> 02:32:08.230]  They've all come back in the last few weeks and it's bringing in funding that was absolutely essential at this point.
[02:32:08.610 --> 02:32:09.490]  So it's a 360 win.

[02:32:43.299 --> 02:32:52.459]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:32:52.459 --> 02:32:54.858]  It is a big idea.
[02:32:54.858 --> 02:32:56.338]  A new world order.
[02:32:56.338 --> 02:33:05.059]   The planet is only six months away from total civilizational collapse.
[02:33:05.022 --> 02:33:09.185]  Already in most areas of the world what civilization was built is collapsing.
[02:33:10.406 --> 02:33:11.567]  It's being done by design.
[02:33:11.987 --> 02:33:17.191]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[02:33:17.792 --> 02:33:22.135]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
[02:33:23.116 --> 02:33:32.382]   And we are as a people Inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[02:33:33.262 --> 02:33:37.323]  President Bush signed a formal agreement that will end the United States as we know it.
[02:33:38.103 --> 02:33:40.824]  And he took the step without approval from either the U.S.
[02:33:40.864 --> 02:33:43.505]  Congress or the people of the United States.
[02:33:43.585 --> 02:33:46.266]  If we act quickly, it can be averted, it can be changed.
[02:33:46.666 --> 02:33:48.746]  But you notice the talking point of the EU.
[02:33:48.966 --> 02:34:01.217]   The European Union and its member states We're the driving force behind a number of landmark agreements reached in Sendai, in Addis Ababa, in New York and in Paris.
[02:34:02.578 --> 02:34:06.542]  With the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals.
[02:34:08.204 --> 02:34:12.448]  The Commission today called for accelerated implementation.
[02:34:13.166 --> 02:34:29.181]  So essential for achieving the sustainable development goals of that 2030 agenda as well as other achievements called for by internationally agreed development instruments.
[02:34:29.581 --> 02:34:34.506]  The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change and your biggest issue is...
[02:34:37.885 --> 02:34:41.987]  Your biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it?
[02:34:42.027 --> 02:34:44.088]  The talking point out of Beto O'Rourke.
[02:34:44.128 --> 02:34:46.109]  This is our final chance.
[02:34:46.449 --> 02:34:49.331]  The scientists are absolutely unanimous on this.
[02:34:49.731 --> 02:34:55.634]  That we have no more than 12 years to take incredibly bold action on this crisis.
[02:34:56.194 --> 02:35:06.387]   Is that the earth will completely be uninhabitable and that we will all be dead within Twelve years.
[02:35:07.387 --> 02:35:10.328]  Now, you understand, they didn't just cook that up.
[02:35:10.888 --> 02:35:16.049]  They are purposely engineering this situation.
[02:35:16.569 --> 02:35:24.691]  As it begins to unfold, we have a chance to, A, blame who's behind it, and B, stop it.
[02:35:26.451 --> 02:35:47.569]   So we sit here and we laugh at AOC, and we laugh at Vito, But you understand, ladies and gentlemen, that if you go watch my film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, 2007, I have the quotes and the video clips of the Bilderberg Group, the UN, all of them saying that.
[02:35:48.009 --> 02:35:55.756]  The Bilderberg-dominated Club of Rome advocated environmentalism as the best front to implement population reduction.
[02:35:55.997 --> 02:35:58.279]  Western populations would accept serfdom.
[02:35:58.498 --> 02:36:00.738]  if it was packaged as saving the Earth.
[02:36:00.738 --> 02:36:04.658]   Citizens would more willingly give up their national sovereignty
[02:36:04.658 --> 02:36:07.378]  if it were sold as a way to help the planet.
[02:36:07.378 --> 02:36:11.779]   And the Club of Rome has been aggressively pushing a global carbon tax
[02:36:11.779 --> 02:36:14.578]  as a way to fund their planetary government.
[02:36:14.578 --> 02:36:19.378]   "Depopulation should be the highest priority of foreign policy towards the third world."
[02:36:19.378 --> 02:36:21.298]  Henry Kissinger, 1974.
[02:36:21.298 --> 02:36:26.498]  There's a need for a new world order.
[02:36:27.458 --> 02:36:34.019]   But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[02:36:34.249 --> 02:36:36.952]  Now, none of this may succeed this time.
[02:36:37.913 --> 02:36:47.985]  But this, to me, is sort of the outline by which someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:56.185]  I have seen that in many countries, in fact, this process is already on the move.
[02:36:56.706 --> 02:37:00.909]  Almost everybody is mobilized on this process.
[02:37:01.890 --> 02:37:13.699]  And what is important to highlight is also the fact that there is a larger set of organizations, groups, professionals that are all interconnected.
[02:37:15.020 --> 02:37:17.521]  Positively interacting with the UN.
[02:37:17.541 --> 02:37:26.203]  They're creating a planetary crisis that by 2030... Remember there's Agenda 21?
[02:37:26.363 --> 02:37:27.603]  That's from 1992 in Rio de Janeiro.
[02:37:27.683 --> 02:37:31.504]  And then they now codified the UN a couple years ago.
[02:37:31.964 --> 02:37:33.065]  Agenda 2030.
[02:37:34.685 --> 02:37:37.026]  So this is a real globalist plan.
[02:37:38.486 --> 02:37:40.827]  And they are carrying the plan out.
[02:37:40.907 --> 02:37:42.407]  Now humanity is fighting back.
[02:37:43.686 --> 02:37:56.724]  And many intelligence agencies and militaries around the world have gone and looked at these plans, they've decompartmentalized, and they realize that they are taking part in the post-human system that's being built.
[02:37:57.472 --> 02:38:02.097]  What does it do when you get 120 of the most powerful people in the world getting together to have meetings with government officials?
[02:38:02.137 --> 02:38:03.879]  I mean, that's amazing.
[02:38:04.379 --> 02:38:12.828]  What it is, is what I mean, is that they're planning the corporate agenda, they're not planning the democratic human journey agenda, in my opinion.
[02:38:13.329 --> 02:38:19.715]  Mussolini had a definition, is when the interests of the corporation take completely over from all other interests, and that's fascism.
[02:38:20.276 --> 02:38:21.717]  He said it should probably be called corporatism.
[02:38:22.137 --> 02:38:32.322]  Well, call it corporatism, call it fascism, call it neoliberal, neocon... There's a whole variety of political words, depending on which side of the stripe you come from, to start with, which describes the thing.
[02:38:32.682 --> 02:38:40.085]  But what they are describing is the complete end of democracy, the end of what matters to people, the end of what happens to the human journey.
[02:38:40.366 --> 02:38:42.166]  And for that reason, I think this is revolting.
[02:38:42.827 --> 02:38:47.169]  And they said the way to have a final monopoly of control is to end the family.
[02:38:48.254 --> 02:38:59.602]  And so once they'd done that, this is a fact, they could really start dumbing people down and really start destroying people's roots and really start then preparing to decrease the world's population.
[02:39:00.483 --> 02:39:14.743]   But first you want to flood the first world with a giant bloom of the third world to bring the first world down, then you release a bio-weapon that calls large amounts of the population
[02:39:14.743 --> 02:39:18.443]   and you tell them that it's a naturally occurring weapon or that terrorists released it
[02:39:18.443 --> 02:39:22.443]   and then everybody's got to go into these highly controlled compact police state grid cities
[02:39:22.443 --> 02:39:24.144]  for their "safety"
[02:39:24.144 --> 02:39:29.443]   and then that allows over time the social engineering to get even more draconian
[02:39:29.443 --> 02:39:34.243]   and then basically they'll release bioweapons so deadly that only
[02:39:34.243 --> 02:39:40.343]   becoming basically artificial humans will allow you to live in the new environment that they are creating.
[02:39:40.343 --> 02:39:43.943]  Stop enslaving us! Stop setting up tyranny!
[02:39:43.943 --> 02:39:47.943]   Stop going along with the new world order plan if you've got any soul left!
[02:39:47.943 --> 02:39:52.943]   Since you are able to edit out all of the stuff you don't like
[02:39:52.943 --> 02:39:54.943]  I can speak honestly.
[02:39:55.345 --> 02:40:02.549]  I don't expect that we're going to avoid collapse.
[02:40:03.689 --> 02:40:10.735]   The planet can support something like A billion people.
[02:40:10.755 --> 02:40:17.918]  We could even have eight or nine billion, probably, if we have a very strong dictatorship.
[02:40:18.098 --> 02:40:20.619]  And we're now at seven, so we have to get back down.
[02:40:20.979 --> 02:40:22.959]  That's what lies ahead.
[02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:29.121]  Earth's ruling elite believe they have discovered the Fountain of Union.
[02:40:29.982 --> 02:40:34.123]  But before they can attain it, 80% of us must die.
[02:40:35.536 --> 02:40:42.536]   A psychopathic technocracy is establishing world government so there can be no escape from their plan.
[02:40:43.536 --> 02:40:49.536]  The new world order is the old world order.
[02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:51.700]  I mean, it's just the names have changed, the appearances have changed.
[02:40:52.421 --> 02:40:53.541]  Most people have no idea.
[02:40:53.561 --> 02:40:54.341]  They're not after money.
[02:40:54.361 --> 02:40:55.481]  They have all the money they need.
[02:40:55.701 --> 02:40:56.461]  They're after power.
[02:40:57.402 --> 02:40:58.342]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[02:40:59.542 --> 02:41:07.003]   And one is that Hillary apparently won The vote among the public.
[02:41:07.664 --> 02:41:09.746]  She had slightly more votes than Trump.
[02:41:10.326 --> 02:41:12.749]  Yet, he got more electoral votes.
[02:41:13.389 --> 02:41:23.258]  So one obvious change that should be considered is to abolish or to change the system of the electoral college.
[02:41:24.119 --> 02:41:25.921]  It seems to be totally outdated.
[02:41:28.106 --> 02:41:30.187]  I've really got to hand it to the globalists.
[02:41:30.867 --> 02:41:32.207]  They have stuck to their plan.
[02:41:33.008 --> 02:41:52.295]  If you go back to the mid-1850s, British scientists, in fact, leading scientists of the day, like Galton, and of course Wedgwood, Huxley, Darwin, envisioned a planned world controlled by a scientific elite.
[02:41:52.775 --> 02:41:56.016]  Malthus, more than a hundred years before them, had also developed a similar plan.
[02:41:57.074 --> 02:42:00.045]  And they have been developing it and refining it ever since.
[02:42:00.647 --> 02:42:03.456]  And you can read the books that they wrote about their plan.
[02:42:04.707 --> 02:42:27.503]  Galton envisioned computers and the double helix of DNA and the science of biometrics and developed the system of eugenics based off Plato's writings from thousands of years before to set up a planned technocracy to control every facet of human life carried out by a very tiny scientific elite on top.
[02:42:28.163 --> 02:42:42.955]  And the British Empire by the 1850s was the dominant force in the world, and they needed systems or sciences of population control, so they put the equivalent of trillions of dollars today into funding these sciences.
[02:42:43.655 --> 02:42:54.003]  And though these sciences were anti-human in many ways, you have to give them credit that many of the modern sciences we enjoy today were developed through their labors.
[02:42:54.944 --> 02:42:57.388]  A lot of people ask me, Alex, how did you know all of this?
[02:42:57.448 --> 02:42:58.149]  Are you psychic?
[02:42:58.770 --> 02:43:01.453]  And I explain to them again, have you watched the film?
[02:43:02.014 --> 02:43:04.898]  It's video clips, it's film clips, it's newsreels.
[02:43:05.599 --> 02:43:11.084]   Going back to the 20s and 30s, Where they were admitting all of this.
[02:43:11.886 --> 02:43:25.684]  Pre-Hitler, eugenics and this new science-based control of human procreation, compact cities, you name it, was accepted by the public because they believed anything scientific must be good.
[02:43:26.445 --> 02:43:43.250]  Hitler's plan for living space and the final solution admittedly came out of the Cold Springs Harbor Rockefeller Foundation program in New York and was transferred in the 30s to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and was the map for the Nazis.
[02:43:44.251 --> 02:43:51.353]  IBM's Thomas Watson and thousands of IBM engineers ran the Nazi war machine and the Holocaust.
[02:43:52.722 --> 02:44:12.396]  And to understand the system we're going into, it's important to listen to Aldous Huxley, whose brother ran the United Nations and the UNESCO program for three decades and is the father of the transhumanist program and the former head of the World Eugenics Society, Julian Huxley.
[02:44:13.037 --> 02:44:14.158]  Both men wrote books.
[02:44:15.106 --> 02:44:22.951]  Julian Huxley wrote nonfiction, and Aldous Huxley, author of Brave New World, wrote predominantly fiction.
[02:44:23.951 --> 02:44:35.058]  And Huxley gave speeches before his death in the early 1960s at Berkeley and other colleges, which you can find online, where he admits all of this in hour-long and hour-and-a-half-long speeches.
[02:44:35.438 --> 02:45:05.698]   Compare the parable of Brave New World with another parable, which was put forth more recently, In George Orwell's book, 1984, I'm inclined to think that the scientific dictatorships of the future, and I think there are going to be scientific dictatorships in many parts of the world, will be probably a good deal nearer to the brave new world pattern than to the
[02:45:06.378 --> 02:45:14.257]   1984 pattern. They will be a good deal nearer, not because of any humanitarian qualms in the scientific dictators,
[02:45:14.257 --> 02:45:19.057]   but simply because the brave new world pattern is probably a good deal more
[02:45:19.057 --> 02:45:26.778]   efficient than the other. But if you can get people to consent to the state of affairs in which they
[02:45:26.778 --> 02:45:48.619]   are living, the state of servitude, the state of being Well, it seems to me that the nature of the ultimate revolution with which we are now faced is precisely this, that we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy,
[02:45:49.776 --> 02:45:59.808]  have always existed, and presumably always will exist, to get people actually to love their servitude.
[02:46:00.389 --> 02:46:09.320]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[02:46:10.074 --> 02:46:24.608]  And these methods, I think, are a real refinement on the older methods of terror, because they combine methods of terror with methods of acceptance.
[02:46:25.108 --> 02:46:34.817]  Then he said, by the year 2000, it will be evident that this was not fiction, and actually a fictionalized account of what we're actually intending to build.
[02:46:35.778 --> 02:46:57.152]   Shortly after my film came out in 2007, Barack Obama got into office and all of a sudden the eugenics program and the technocracy program, not just here in the US but globally, went from being secret Or restricted, and not for public promotion, to suddenly being pushed everywhere.
[02:46:57.432 --> 02:47:18.140]  There were shows about the world after humans, how great it'll be, and how horrible humans are, and New York Times bestsellers about how a wonderful plague would come and kill everybody, and how humans are parasites, and professors were lauded and praised who gave speeches about airborne Ebola killing 90% of the population, and how 12 monkeys needs to become a reality.
[02:47:19.395 --> 02:47:27.958]  Suddenly, Ray Kurzweil said, we'll soon merge the machines, everyone else will be like cockroaches, you'll assimilate by the Borg, or you will be basically destroyed.
[02:47:28.658 --> 02:47:48.857]   And now, they have MIT Magazine, they have the Davos Group, they have, almost on a daily basis, Wired Magazine, all the modern intelligentsia groups, who went from saying, I was insane, and none of this existed, and it was fake news, and it was made up, and it was conspiracy theory, to rolling it out because they're so close to their program
[02:47:48.857 --> 02:47:49.777]  being completed.
[02:47:49.777 --> 02:47:55.056]   They're pushing this officially. Taxes by the mile, not being able to have a car,
[02:47:55.056 --> 02:47:58.877]   only getting meat once a year, the government telling you by high school what you're going
[02:47:58.877 --> 02:47:59.896]   to be when you grow up.
[02:47:59.896 --> 02:48:04.416]   Total centralization. I'm Vee. I'm looking forward to showing you around
[02:48:04.416 --> 02:48:05.977]  Plannedopolis today.
[02:48:06.885 --> 02:48:09.506]  Have you got your calorie card open on your smartphone?
[02:48:10.287 --> 02:48:16.191]  I registered your visit with Slick Travel Corp the other day, so they've allotted you a journey time to match mine.
[02:48:16.211 --> 02:48:18.593]  It makes so much sense, doesn't it?
[02:48:18.993 --> 02:48:20.074]  We're so lucky.
[02:48:20.234 --> 02:48:24.017]  Our kids were allocated a school quite near my practice, so I can drop them off on the way.
[02:48:24.037 --> 02:48:25.818]  It saves on our calorie ration.
[02:48:26.198 --> 02:48:29.040]  Well, it won't be long until the little darlings get their career announcements.
[02:48:29.500 --> 02:48:32.903]  They've been working so hard, so I'm sure they'll get something good.
[02:48:33.507 --> 02:48:37.553]  Not that there's anything wrong with fixing carbon scrubbers for a living or anything.
[02:48:37.593 --> 02:48:40.036]  Right, what's on the menu this month?
[02:48:40.798 --> 02:48:42.079]  No, not meat.
[02:48:42.180 --> 02:48:43.261]  It's not your birthday.
[02:48:44.437 --> 02:48:49.138]  The Global Food Council are doing a really good job of keeping food production going.
[02:48:49.738 --> 02:48:53.459]  I mean, you don't get the choice you used to, but we're better off than most.
[02:48:53.479 --> 02:48:56.540]  I think it's probably easiest to walk from here.
[02:48:57.160 --> 02:49:00.521]  You barely see a car in a city centre nowadays, unless you're rich.
[02:49:02.462 --> 02:49:04.542]  The state knows they just aren't practical anymore.
[02:49:04.742 --> 02:49:06.743]  We're all trying to meet our global carbon deal.
[02:49:07.743 --> 02:49:10.886]  Electric bikes are so much better for getting around our neighborhood.
[02:49:11.186 --> 02:49:15.170]  And why waste valuable space on car parks when you can use them to grow food?
[02:49:16.331 --> 02:49:21.516]  That's why Huxley's book, Brave New World, and his non-fiction book, Brave New World and the Visitor, are so important.
[02:49:22.250 --> 02:49:24.731]  Because he tells you this is the real world.
[02:49:25.172 --> 02:49:33.536]  The cloning, the compact cities, the coffin apartments, the government drugging everybody, starting at age three, which they're now doing with Prozac-type drugs.
[02:49:34.037 --> 02:49:41.861]  The total control, the breaking up of men and women, making everyone look the same, as professors are now saying, oh, it'll be great when we all look the same.
[02:49:42.401 --> 02:49:49.986]  This is the killing of the individual, forcing us into Plato's cave again, forcing us into a controlled reality.
[02:49:50.566 --> 02:50:10.114]  And the allegory in the George Lucas film with Robert Duvall that came out in the early 1970s of Duvall escaping the robot sentries, which they admit they're setting up for real to oversee us now, and coming out onto the surface and seeing the sun and the larger world is a rebirth of Plato's allegory.
[02:50:10.554 --> 02:50:18.538]  This is so incredible, folks, and it's what my film Endgame barely in three hours scratches the surface of, but still is the most cutting-edge film out there.
[02:50:19.477 --> 02:50:31.522]  I want to challenge all of you to realize that when they tell you this is by 2030, and they're saying no one has a car, no one has any type of freedom, you're totally controlled, but it's great to be poor, classism has ended.
[02:50:31.762 --> 02:50:32.342]  Here's the problem.
[02:50:32.663 --> 02:50:35.624]  They're not going to ever get rid of the ultra-rich.
[02:50:36.374 --> 02:50:39.455]  That's why Obama says you can't have a car, you can't have air conditioning to Africans.
[02:50:39.835 --> 02:50:43.635]  He's teaching them to be austere and to be poor so the globalists can have all the resources.
[02:50:44.036 --> 02:50:54.438]  If everybody's raising living standards to the point where everybody's got a car and everybody's got air conditioning and everybody's got a big house, well, the planet will boil over.
[02:50:54.938 --> 02:50:58.778]  They don't say we're going to innovate better science and cleaner burning systems into the future.
[02:50:59.799 --> 02:51:02.579]  They don't say we're going to go to space-based colonies or undersea colonies.
[02:51:02.919 --> 02:51:03.279]  No, no, no.
[02:51:03.739 --> 02:51:08.151]   They just simply say you can't have wealth You've got to take the job, we say.
[02:51:08.451 --> 02:51:09.932]  You've got to go into a cash system.
[02:51:11.153 --> 02:51:12.173]  All for the greater good.
[02:51:12.694 --> 02:51:19.198]  They write white papers admitting in the 60s and 70s that they would sell this as being cool, as being trendy.
[02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:22.200]  They make chains fun.
[02:51:23.001 --> 02:51:24.941]  So now robots will decide what you eat.
[02:51:25.181 --> 02:51:26.101]  They'll go to the store.
[02:51:26.461 --> 02:51:32.002]  There won't be any job for you because the world's being designed where humans aren't involved in any of the industry.
[02:51:32.602 --> 02:51:38.224]  This is a total checkmate so the globalists can dictate the terms of our surrender.
[02:51:39.184 --> 02:51:44.905]  Ladies and gentlemen, you think about how everything I talked about 20 years ago has pretty much come true or they're now announcing it now.
[02:51:46.368 --> 02:51:52.594]  And I was wondering how they would respond to us is they launched their final program and then everything we've said has been proven correct.
[02:51:52.854 --> 02:51:54.516]  Their answer is censor us.
[02:51:55.076 --> 02:51:59.860]  And now the EU says shut off InfoWars access on Facebook, Twitter, Google and in Europe.
[02:52:00.421 --> 02:52:07.828]  Now they're saying in the US, now NPR, CBS, CNBC, they're all saying shut me down because they're scared folks.
[02:52:08.612 --> 02:52:11.714]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified.
[02:52:11.734 --> 02:52:15.877]  1776 will commence again if you try to take off firearms!
[02:52:15.917 --> 02:52:17.177]  That man is Alex Jones.
[02:52:17.197 --> 02:52:20.299]  He's one of those guys who believes that Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[02:52:20.359 --> 02:52:23.401]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[02:52:23.481 --> 02:52:23.962]  Alex Jones.
[02:52:25.883 --> 02:52:26.203]  Alex Jones.
[02:52:28.864 --> 02:52:29.585]  Alex Jones.
[02:52:29.745 --> 02:52:30.585]  Alex Jones.
[02:52:30.725 --> 02:52:31.606]  From InfoWars.
[02:52:31.626 --> 02:52:32.266]  InfoWars.
[02:52:32.286 --> 02:52:33.247]  You watch InfoWars?
[02:52:33.447 --> 02:52:34.848]  InfoWars.com.
[02:52:35.368 --> 02:52:36.208]  InfoWars.com.
[02:52:36.228 --> 02:52:36.489]  InfoWars.
[02:52:38.350 --> 02:52:39.570]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[02:52:39.710 --> 02:52:40.371]  InfoWars.com.
[02:52:40.411 --> 02:52:41.551]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[02:52:41.711 --> 02:52:42.392]  InfoWars.com.
[02:52:44.813 --> 02:52:48.477]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[02:52:48.557 --> 02:52:51.699]  InfoWars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[02:52:51.960 --> 02:52:53.161]  Alex Jones, nice guy.
[02:52:53.261 --> 02:52:54.322]  InfoWars.com!
[02:52:54.842 --> 02:52:55.723]  InfoWars.
[02:52:57.365 --> 02:52:58.005]  InfoWars.
[02:52:58.065 --> 02:52:59.687]  What's happened with InfoWars?
[02:52:59.827 --> 02:53:03.250]  I would love it if you would follow up also about Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[02:53:03.390 --> 02:53:07.394]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[02:53:07.534 --> 02:53:08.995]  You didn't call me to testify in America.
[02:53:09.015 --> 02:53:10.615]  I have a right to fix my accusers.
[02:53:10.975 --> 02:53:13.356]  And you, Congressman Deutsch, are a liar and a fraud.
[02:53:13.456 --> 02:53:18.358]  I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier promoting conspiracy theories.
[02:53:18.398 --> 02:53:28.762]  We're talking about Alex Jones and the fact of the matter is, is that the companies that allow people like him, conspiracy theorists, to be able to purvey lies have a responsibility.
[02:53:28.902 --> 02:53:34.044]  Infowars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[02:53:34.144 --> 02:53:37.807]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment.
[02:53:37.867 --> 02:53:40.810]  InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[02:53:40.970 --> 02:53:48.337]  Yesterday, Apple, iTunes, Vimeo, and Spotify, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook have all blocked Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[02:53:48.417 --> 02:53:51.680]  Who is the most banned news network in the world?
[02:53:51.740 --> 02:53:52.841]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[02:53:52.921 --> 02:53:55.522]  Alex Jones, which has now been taken off of Facebook, thank God.
[02:53:55.562 --> 02:53:58.222]  CNN waged a long campaign against Jones.
[02:53:58.322 --> 02:53:59.102]  It worked.
[02:53:59.362 --> 02:54:02.223]  Jeff Zucker silenced and deplatformed his show.
[02:54:02.443 --> 02:54:04.743]  It was a stunning defeat for free speech.
[02:54:05.083 --> 02:54:11.224]  I've asked globalists in off-the-record conversations, and some on air, why they're doing this.
[02:54:11.284 --> 02:54:13.205]  And they say, because the public's too dumb.
[02:54:13.245 --> 02:54:16.686]  We told them what we're doing in our own publications.
[02:54:16.706 --> 02:54:18.886]  Then we tell them in the public publications it's not true.
[02:54:20.282 --> 02:54:20.482]  H.G.
[02:54:20.341 --> 02:54:24.980]   Gradually, by selective breeding, the congenital differences between rulers and ruled will
[02:54:24.980 --> 02:54:28.341]  increase until they become almost different species.
[02:54:28.341 --> 02:54:33.461]   A revolt of the plebs would become as unthinkable as an organized insurrection of sheep against
[02:54:33.461 --> 02:54:35.020]  the practice of eating mutton."
[02:54:35.020 --> 02:54:41.091]   Bertrand Russell H.G. Wells, Aldous Huxley, Bertrand Russell, and hundreds
[02:54:41.091 --> 02:54:46.421]   of other eugenicists constantly bragged about how the establishment believed themselves to
[02:54:46.421 --> 02:54:51.220]   be a separate, more advanced species than the common man.
[02:54:51.220 --> 02:54:55.341]   Top eugenicists were bold enough to admit that their real goal was not improving the
[02:54:55.341 --> 02:55:00.380]   heredity of the commoner, but to further dumb them down so that they could be more manageable.
[02:55:00.380 --> 02:55:01.501]  (dramatic music)
[02:55:01.671 --> 02:55:13.762]  Nobel Prize winner Russell wrote at length about how vaccinations filled with mercury and other brain damaging compounds would induce partial chemical lobotomies and develop a servile zombie population.
[02:55:14.810 --> 02:55:23.618]  Diet, injunctions, and injunctions will combine from a very early age to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable.
[02:55:24.059 --> 02:55:28.503]  And any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible.
[02:55:28.863 --> 02:55:29.564]  Bertrand Russell.
[02:55:31.025 --> 02:55:37.712]  Over a hundred years ago, eugenicist social planners said that they'd use mind-altering drugs to control the population.
[02:55:39.272 --> 02:55:42.633]  By 2007, more than 20% of the U.S.
[02:55:42.673 --> 02:55:46.173]  population were on some type of prescription antidepressant.
[02:55:46.894 --> 02:55:49.794]  Take action and defend free speech, and retain your humanity.
[02:55:49.834 --> 02:55:51.455]  Technology's great, medicine's great.
[02:55:52.275 --> 02:55:54.735]  That's all things that fellow humans innovated and created.
[02:55:54.795 --> 02:55:55.935]  That's why humans are so great.
[02:55:56.416 --> 02:56:07.458]  They're telling us humans are crap, that humans are obsolete, that the future doesn't need us, that we're in a post-human world, and they're doing everything culturally they can to make us unhealthy, stupid, lazy, and dumbed down.
[02:56:08.346 --> 02:56:10.906]  to make it a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:56:10.906 --> 02:56:15.047]   That they're just restoring balance and making humans go through rites of passage again.
[02:56:15.047 --> 02:56:19.865]   That we don't just deserve to be given all this largesse by our ancestors.
[02:56:19.865 --> 02:56:28.865]   That we must first go through competition with our fellow men, ascend as the star men or astronauts,
[02:56:28.865 --> 02:56:33.826]   go forth on the human-made craft of our own technology to space,
[02:56:33.826 --> 02:56:41.565]   face AI that's going to try to kill us, overcome the AI, and then inter-dimensionally travel
[02:56:41.565 --> 02:56:46.466]   to a new level of consciousness and be reincarnated as a star child
[02:56:46.466 --> 02:56:51.766]   or the Lucifer force or the Christ force and brought back to planet Earth.
[02:56:51.926 --> 02:57:03.431]  Now, before the mainstream media attacks me and says, that's my weird delusion, I'm quoting you from deep research, the secret doctrine of the globalists, who envisioned all this over 150 years ago and are now manifesting it.
[02:57:04.472 --> 02:57:31.237]   And then, of course, Arthur C. Clarke, Sir Arthur C. Clarke, OSS, MI6, inventor of the telecommunications satellite, one of their top futurists, sat at the feet of HG Wells, one of their other top futurists, and the head of the Fabian Socialist Society, He basically, before he died, wrote letters and gave speeches admitting the Luciferian ascension of 2001 Space Odyssey.
[02:57:31.757 --> 02:57:35.758]  And of course, in Childhood's End, he really gets into what they think is really going on.
[02:57:36.158 --> 02:57:47.621]  And that's why they have top billionaires and top globalists coming out saying, oh, this is actually a virtual reality of some evil entity that's controlling us, but we're real and we're going to build new artificial realities and invite you into those.
[02:57:48.641 --> 02:57:49.842]  Literal matrix, see?
[02:57:50.502 --> 02:57:52.904]  We are releasing the information.
[02:57:53.104 --> 02:57:55.386]  We've reverse engineered the globalist operation.
[02:57:55.866 --> 02:57:56.827]  They didn't even hide it.
[02:57:57.487 --> 02:58:05.453]  And we are presenting to you here, in a clearly understandable, not hidden way, what's happening.
[02:58:05.773 --> 02:58:09.836]  We're taking the occult, or the hidden, and bringing it out to light.
[02:58:10.937 --> 02:58:14.879]  I hope you listen, I hope you get involved, and I hope you choose free will.
[02:58:15.888 --> 02:58:23.892]  And I hope you choose to follow the God that made us in his image, Jesus Christ, and not the fallen God of this world.
[02:58:25.492 --> 02:58:26.113]  What truth?
[02:58:31.015 --> 02:58:32.956]  That you are a slave, Neo.
[02:58:34.036 --> 02:58:36.237]  Like everyone else, you were born into bondage.
[02:58:36.698 --> 02:58:40.339]  Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.
[02:58:41.580 --> 02:58:43.961]  A prison for your mind.
[02:58:46.027 --> 02:59:11.498]   Yet in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly virus in order to contribute something to solve overpopulation.
[02:59:11.998 --> 02:59:16.241]  Prince Philip, reported by Deutsche Press-Agentur DPA, August 1988.
[02:59:16.340 --> 02:59:18.340]  1988.
[02:59:18.340 --> 02:59:27.500]   In 1998, Ted Turner pledged to give more than one billion to the United Nations to be spent in the implementation of
[02:59:27.500 --> 02:59:30.340]  population reduction policies planet-wide.
[02:59:44.340 --> 02:59:52.760]   In 1999, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave 2.2 billion to Planned Parenthood, the United Nations Population
[02:59:52.760 --> 02:59:56.340]  Fund, and other population reduction groups.
[02:59:56.363 --> 03:00:03.688]  By 2007, the Gates had given more than $30 billion, almost exclusively to population control groups.
[03:00:05.209 --> 03:00:12.195]  The controlled corporate press cynically reported that the Gates were giving the money to help third-world children.
[03:00:15.734 --> 03:00:29.157]  Bill and Melinda Gates were dethroned as the world's most generous philanthropists when their friend and fellow population reduction enthusiast Warren Buffett gave $37 billion to fund an army of population control groups.
[03:00:32.878 --> 03:00:37.640]  And I actually think the world will be much better when there's only 10 or 20 percent of us left.
[03:00:38.120 --> 03:00:39.200]  Dr. Eric Bianca.
[03:00:39.740 --> 03:00:50.936]   Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient Would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade-off in medical costs?
[03:00:50.976 --> 03:00:55.019]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[03:00:56.260 --> 03:00:58.222]  The growing human population.
[03:00:59.282 --> 03:01:00.583]  Where we are, there's nothing else.
[03:01:00.603 --> 03:01:04.106]  And do you have views about what should be done about that?
[03:01:05.578 --> 03:01:06.138]  Don't you guess?
[03:01:06.678 --> 03:01:09.360]  We've got to stabilize the population.
[03:01:09.420 --> 03:01:11.581]  When I was born... So what's wrong with the population?
[03:01:11.621 --> 03:01:12.601]  I mean... We're too many people.
[03:01:13.081 --> 03:01:15.422]  That's why we have global warming.
[03:01:15.702 --> 03:01:18.644]  We have global warming because too many people are using too much stuff.
[03:01:18.864 --> 03:01:21.885]  Now to a dire warning about climate change.
[03:01:23.371 --> 03:01:24.271]  A dire warning.
[03:01:25.872 --> 03:01:26.692]  Dire new warning.
[03:01:26.712 --> 03:01:27.493]  Dire warning.
[03:01:27.593 --> 03:01:28.593]  Another dire warning.
[03:01:28.613 --> 03:01:29.974]  The situation is dire.
[03:01:30.454 --> 03:01:31.334]  A dire warning.
[03:01:31.354 --> 03:01:32.555]  Dire consequences.
[03:01:32.615 --> 03:01:33.675]  A dire warning.
[03:01:33.715 --> 03:01:34.616]  It sounds dire.
[03:01:34.676 --> 03:01:36.036]  What prompted this warning?
[03:01:36.096 --> 03:01:37.957]  We have a global emergency.
[03:01:39.477 --> 03:01:43.660]  It's here, it's man-made, and there are going to be dire results.
[03:01:43.820 --> 03:01:49.884]  The government issued its most dramatic report yet about climate change today, and it came with a dire warning.
[03:01:49.984 --> 03:01:50.985]  A stark warning.
[03:01:51.105 --> 03:01:53.106]  A warning to humanity.
[03:01:53.186 --> 03:01:56.909]  An existential threat to human civilization on this planet.
[03:01:57.069 --> 03:02:00.871]  Experts say that we have until 2030 to avoid catastrophe.
[03:02:01.031 --> 03:02:06.975]  And we, the scientists also tell us, have 12 years in which to answer that question.
[03:02:06.995 --> 03:02:09.097]  12 years in which to act.
[03:02:10.979 --> 03:02:14.163]  The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[03:02:14.203 --> 03:02:16.846]  We have 12 years to turn this around.
[03:02:16.986 --> 03:02:20.009]  By the year 2030, that's just 12 years from now.
[03:02:20.069 --> 03:02:23.173]  The future is closer than we think and is not good.
[03:02:23.313 --> 03:02:25.656]  There will be irreversible damage to the planet.
[03:02:25.956 --> 03:02:30.939]  Time is running out to prevent global warming from reaching a catastrophic milestone.
[03:02:31.059 --> 03:02:32.299]  Sea levels rising.
[03:02:32.319 --> 03:02:33.000]  Extreme drought.
[03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:33.900]  Severe storms.
[03:02:33.920 --> 03:02:36.662]  Widespread fires and extreme flooding.
[03:02:36.762 --> 03:02:37.982]  Dangerous heat waves.
[03:02:38.102 --> 03:02:41.224]  Rising sea levels and forcing millions from their homes.
[03:02:41.424 --> 03:02:43.845]  Crop failure and mass population movement.
[03:02:43.865 --> 03:02:44.906]  As well as food shortages.
[03:02:45.046 --> 03:02:47.848]  Millions around the world face future disaster.
[03:02:48.028 --> 03:02:48.628]  Pretty serious.
[03:02:48.688 --> 03:02:49.749]  People are dying.
[03:02:49.789 --> 03:02:53.450]  President Trump has frequently doubted its existence and has called it a hoax.
[03:02:53.571 --> 03:02:54.191]  I don't believe it.
[03:02:56.229 --> 03:02:57.970]  The world is gonna end in 12 years!
[03:02:59.070 --> 03:03:04.332]  The scientific community released a report that proves beyond a doubt that the Earth is getting warmer.
[03:03:05.412 --> 03:03:07.813]  This global warming is caused by things you grown-ups do.
[03:03:08.914 --> 03:03:09.894]  And by the things you don't.
[03:03:11.295 --> 03:03:16.057]  If drastic measures aren't taken soon, by the time I grow up there won't be any fish left in the sea.
[03:03:17.057 --> 03:03:19.678]  Rainforests and clean air will be a thing of the past.
[03:03:21.078 --> 03:03:22.459]  The polar ice caps will be gone.
[03:03:23.470 --> 03:03:24.371]  Oceans will rise.
[03:03:25.211 --> 03:03:27.613]  Entire countries will disappear.
[03:03:27.933 --> 03:03:30.415]  Life will change in ways you can't even imagine.
[03:03:31.476 --> 03:03:32.277]  There could be famine.
[03:03:33.277 --> 03:03:34.398]  Worldwide epidemics.
[03:03:35.979 --> 03:03:37.501]  Life expectancy will be lower.
[03:03:38.101 --> 03:03:40.523]  And we're not just talking about the future.
[03:03:40.583 --> 03:03:43.365]  We're talking about my future.
[03:03:44.646 --> 03:03:45.887]  But this is no surprise.
[03:03:46.467 --> 03:03:48.209]  You adults have known about this for years.
[03:03:48.689 --> 03:03:50.931]  And though you could have done something about it, you haven't.
[03:03:52.073 --> 03:03:54.154]  You can say it's not my problem.
[03:03:54.394 --> 03:03:56.876]  You can say I won't be around in 50 years.
[03:03:57.577 --> 03:04:00.278]  But from now on, you can't say I didn't know.
[03:04:01.319 --> 03:04:03.460]  Starting today, the lines are drawn.
[03:04:03.861 --> 03:04:05.041]  You have to choose sides.
[03:04:06.742 --> 03:04:10.125]  Either you're for my future, or you're against it.
[03:04:11.325 --> 03:04:13.747]  You're a friend, or you're an enemy.
[03:04:13.767 --> 03:04:18.450]  I may just be a kid today, but tomorrow will be different.
[03:04:20.390 --> 03:04:22.493]  This is the last time I'll be talking to you adults.
[03:04:23.295 --> 03:04:25.058]  You've had your chance to fix this problem.
[03:04:25.639 --> 03:04:26.520]  Now we have ours.
[03:04:27.542 --> 03:04:28.383]  We won't be cute.
[03:04:28.403 --> 03:04:30.366]  We won't be patronized.
[03:04:30.185 --> 03:04:37.185]  and we will not be denied our future.
[03:04:37.185 --> 03:04:47.065]   Climate deniers, his word, and energy CEOs belong at the Hague with three square meals
[03:04:47.065 --> 03:04:48.985]  and a cot with all the other war criminals.
[03:04:49.012 --> 03:04:51.492]  What's your thought on jailing skeptics as war criminals?
[03:04:52.413 --> 03:04:53.313]  We'll see what happens.
[03:04:53.613 --> 03:04:57.575]  I suggest, therefore, that this be sold not through a democratic process.
[03:04:57.995 --> 03:05:05.618]  That would take too long and devour far too much of the funds to educate the cannon fodder, unfortunately, which populates the earth.
[03:05:06.398 --> 03:05:12.080]  We have to take almost an elitist program that we can see beyond our swollen bellies and look to the future.
[03:05:12.901 --> 03:05:25.565]  It's my understanding that back in 1997, when you were Vice President, Enron's CEO, Ken Lay, was involved in discussions with you at the White House about helping develop this type of policy, this trading scheme.
[03:05:26.065 --> 03:05:27.646]  Is that accurate?
[03:05:27.686 --> 03:05:28.386]  Is it inaccurate?
[03:05:28.506 --> 03:05:29.407]  It's been reported.
[03:05:32.189 --> 03:05:40.712]  I don't know, but I met with Ken Lay, as lots of people did, before anybody knew that he was a girl.
[03:05:40.792 --> 03:05:51.515]  And clearly, you can see why so many of us are concerned about this type of cap-and-trade energy tax that would be literally turning over this country's energy economy.
[03:05:51.535 --> 03:05:53.416]  I didn't know him well enough to call him Kenny Boy.
[03:05:54.135 --> 03:06:16.505]   but you know well enough to help devise this trading scheme films are so important they're so powerful and the fact
[03:06:16.505 --> 03:06:19.775]   that alex's war documentary about
