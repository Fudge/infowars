[00:25.520 --> 00:29.360]  ladies and gentlemen Harrison Smith sitting in for Alex Jones on this
[00:29.360 --> 00:33.560]  Sunday April 10th edition of the Alex Jones show very excited to be with you
[00:33.560 --> 00:39.320]  hope you're all having a good weekend I had a great weekend actually I built a
[00:39.320 --> 00:45.080]  teepee out of bamboo that was pretty fun and I went to the Renaissance fair in
[00:45.080 --> 00:49.760]  just outside of Austin forget what it's called Sherwood fair Sherwood
[00:49.760 --> 00:54.160]  something fair but it was very fun I just bring it up because it wasn't five
[00:54.160 --> 00:58.680]  minutes that I was at that fair that I saw my first info wars shirt and I
[00:58.680 --> 01:02.400]  actually saw several that day so it was fun big shout out to all the info
[01:02.400 --> 01:06.320]  warriors out there dressing up like knights with their beautiful girlfriends
[01:06.320 --> 01:10.200]  dressed up like fairies it was it was a heck of a time and it's fun to see
[01:10.200 --> 01:14.800]  people representing info wars out there in the real world if you can call it the
[01:14.800 --> 01:18.160]  real world really I mean obviously it's a fantasy world and there was one
[01:18.160 --> 01:21.320]  particular moment I was there with my whole family my sister's family and all
[01:21.320 --> 01:25.880]  that and we're walking through this one area and it's like the witchcraft area
[01:25.880 --> 01:30.080]  there's like a standing stone circle it's all very creepy and you go over this
[01:30.080 --> 01:33.040]  one thing where there's like a troll there's like a troll under a bridge and
[01:33.040 --> 01:37.360]  you go over the bridge he's got a cage it's like you know free babysitting it's
[01:37.360 --> 01:41.960]  all very funny but it's like this whole area that's like the pagan witchcraft
[01:41.960 --> 01:47.240]  area and you make your way through that and then and it's all gnarled branches
[01:47.240 --> 01:51.560]  and like creepy skulls and people weren't wearing horns and it's very like weird
[01:51.560 --> 01:55.640]  and strange and then you go through that and then they had like the Christian
[01:55.640 --> 01:59.160]  area and it's like the little it's a little garden that's the st. Francis
[01:59.160 --> 02:03.080]  garden with all these statues of little animals and st. Francis there in the
[02:03.080 --> 02:07.040]  middle of it and then there's a chapel there it's like an open-air pavilion
[02:07.040 --> 02:10.720]  sort of thing where they were there actually conducting a wedding at the
[02:10.720 --> 02:14.240]  times there's this heart player playing beautiful music as like as soon as we
[02:14.240 --> 02:18.800]  got through my sister was like oh civilization we found it we made it out
[02:18.800 --> 02:24.640]  through the dark ages through the the pagan madness of terror and gnarled
[02:24.640 --> 02:29.000]  branches and shadowy figures and into the Christian world where it's all
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.600]  bright and sunny and there's heart music playing and it was very funny and I
[02:33.600 --> 02:38.280]  don't know sort of indicative of of reality you know people detractors
[02:38.280 --> 02:41.840]  atheists these people they want they want you to think of Christianity as this
[02:41.840 --> 02:47.840]  you know terrible man in the sky that's just prodding humanity with a stick and
[02:47.840 --> 02:53.840]  hates us or something but it's like man if you really go back in history before
[02:53.840 --> 02:59.320]  Christianity came around it was who it was it was weird it was very weird out
[02:59.320 --> 03:02.960]  there folks very weird indeed and that's what we're getting back to that's what
[03:02.960 --> 03:06.120]  I think that's what the great reset is all about is undoing all of this
[03:06.120 --> 03:11.960]  progress and beauty and peace and tranquility that Christianity brings
[03:11.960 --> 03:16.960]  about let's just dive right back into the witchcraft pagan child sacrifice
[03:16.960 --> 03:20.520]  days of old I think they really is there's something very appealing about
[03:20.520 --> 03:24.880]  that to certain people and it's very weird it's very strange another sort of
[03:24.880 --> 03:28.680]  strange thing that I noticed because I've always gone to these the Texas
[03:28.680 --> 03:31.560]  Renaissance fairs like it was one of the first since the biggest one and it was
[03:31.560 --> 03:35.640]  near Houston so growing up I'd go every year and when I was little and you would
[03:35.640 --> 03:38.880]  do a little carnival game you'd smash the hammer thing or you chew the bone
[03:38.880 --> 03:42.200]  arrow whatever they give you a little coupon for a free kiss you'd have a
[03:42.200 --> 03:45.960]  little card and say one free kiss presents to the winch of your choosing
[03:45.960 --> 03:51.920]  or ever and it was fun because a little kid you'd go up to a sexy winch and give
[03:51.920 --> 03:54.440]  her this little card and she'd give you a kiss on the cheek and it was very fun
[03:54.440 --> 03:58.200]  and innocent and playful but they got rid of that we can't do that anymore free
[03:58.200 --> 04:03.720]  kisses my god with rape culture I mean no way we can't have that free innocent
[04:03.720 --> 04:09.240]  kisses from a lovely winch no no no not in my not in my backyard so instead now
[04:09.240 --> 04:16.160]  people have badges that say their sexual proclivities it's very weird so it's
[04:16.160 --> 04:21.360]  like I think this is sort of indicative or sort of just symbolic of like the
[04:21.360 --> 04:26.240]  the weird off-the-rails changes that our society are making where it's like a
[04:26.240 --> 04:30.800]  free free kisses of the Renaissance fair no way that's rape culture but I will
[04:30.800 --> 04:36.400]  wear a pin that says I'm bisexual and I'm submissive and dominant submissive
[04:36.400 --> 04:41.280]  relationships I'll wear that on my lapel just like this is weird this is
[04:41.280 --> 04:46.240]  creepy used to be innocent and fun and joyful now it's a little creepy and
[04:46.240 --> 04:50.480]  weird and sexualized and it's just like yeah this is this is our society now
[04:50.480 --> 04:53.640]  this is where we are we already going to break I thought we had long long
[04:53.640 --> 04:55.720]  segments here all right we're going to break we'll be right back when we come
[04:55.720 --> 04:58.600]  back with a Greg Reese report stay tuned folks I'll stop talking about the
[04:58.600 --> 05:05.200]  Renaissance fair we are only offering three coins in the series the first
[05:05.200 --> 05:10.640]  coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days now the second
[05:10.640 --> 05:17.360]  coin as we enter the last days of March into April 2022 is now being offered and
[05:17.360 --> 05:21.440]  I believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic
[05:21.440 --> 05:25.600]  coins and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep info
[05:25.600 --> 05:29.920]  wars at the front lines of the fight against these tyrants so go for yourself

[06:40.680 --> 06:45.520]  edition of a man's world which is his magazine and I was actually asked to
[06:45.520 --> 06:50.480]  write an article for it and I I delved in it's probably the first thing I've
[06:50.480 --> 06:54.920]  actually written since getting out of school it's so much easier just to sit
[06:54.920 --> 06:57.720]  up here and talk and just sort of go off the cuff as soon as I have to start
[06:57.720 --> 07:02.240]  writing something I'm agonizing over every word every sentence I rewrite like
[07:02.240 --> 07:05.400]  ten times just to get it right and it just takes me forever and it's exhausting
[07:05.400 --> 07:08.640]  but what come at what came out of it I am very proud of it's an article called
[07:08.640 --> 07:13.040]  remember the Alamo so I may do maybe do a little reading from that just talk
[07:13.040 --> 07:16.400]  about some of the stuff I didn't actually get to include in the article and
[07:16.400 --> 07:20.440]  encourage everybody out there to go download this and support raw egg
[07:20.440 --> 07:25.760]  nationalists on Twitter at baby gravy nine is the name of his Twitter account

[07:30.200 --> 07:36.680]  about that in just a little bit as well man of course on topic today but the
[07:36.680 --> 07:41.400]  collapse the obvious and oncoming collapse government tyranny what else
[07:41.400 --> 07:47.240]  we got just war war across the world and no sign of that slowing down loss we
[07:47.240 --> 07:53.280]  talking of course about transgenderism of course because we have to and in this
[07:53.280 --> 08:01.000]  particular case about transgenderism by corporations very strange stuff we're
[08:01.000 --> 08:05.440]  going to start with this video by Greg Reese called the dark side of Disney
[08:05.440 --> 08:12.280]  Gregory's has gone down the rabbit hole of rabbit holes with Disney and and come
[08:12.280 --> 08:15.720]  up with those remember you can share this video at band.videonm4s.com here is
[08:15.720 --> 08:19.720]  Gregory's with the dark side of Disney
[08:23.720 --> 08:30.400]  after governor Ron DeSantis signed an anti-groomer bill into law that prevents
[08:30.400 --> 08:35.440]  school teachers from engaging five-year-olds about homosexual sex acts
[08:35.440 --> 08:40.880]  and radical transgender ideology the groomers have come out of the woodwork
[08:40.880 --> 08:46.720]  and many people are waking up to the dark side of Disney investigative
[08:46.720 --> 08:51.880]  journalist Christopher Rufo has outlined a partial list of Disney employees
[08:51.880 --> 08:57.920]  who have been arrested for child sex crimes Robert King solver was a service

[09:21.800 --> 09:27.840]  confessed to having sex with a 15-year-old boy he groomed online Animal
[09:27.840 --> 09:32.880]  Kingdom Lodge gift shop worker Paul Fazio was convicted of downloading

[10:13.360 --> 10:18.760]  Disney Magic ships Oceania kids lab after blindfolding the child and spinning
[10:18.760 --> 10:25.120]  him around several times as part of a game in 2012 an 11-year-old girl was
[10:25.120 --> 10:30.560]  groped and kissed in an elevator by 33-year-old Milton Burganza a dining
[10:30.560 --> 10:35.720]  server on the Disney Dream a cruise line security officer was told by Disney
[10:35.720 --> 10:40.560]  officials to keep her mouth shut and do nothing two days later when the ship
[10:40.560 --> 10:45.720]  arrived in Nassau Burganza admitted to the Bahamas police that he molested the
[10:45.720 --> 10:50.520]  girl and was then taken to the airport where Disney arranged for his flight
[10:50.520 --> 10:57.320]  back home to India last year Hollywood Studios custodians Jonathan McGrew and
[10:57.320 --> 11:01.800]  Savannah Lawrence were caught attempting to have a threesome with a 13-year-old
[11:01.800 --> 11:07.480]  McGrew said that the couple's fantasy was to play stepdad stepdaughter step
[11:07.480 --> 11:13.360]  mother Animal Kingdom Lodge lifeguard Kenneth Aquino was arrested after trying
[11:13.360 --> 11:19.200]  to have sex with a 13-year-old showing up in his Disney work clothes of course
[11:19.200 --> 11:23.640]  child predators will naturally seek employment at Disney but it's
[11:23.640 --> 11:28.720]  everywhere within the company director of music publishing John Healy was
[11:28.720 --> 11:35.040]  charged with three felony counts of child sexual abuse in 2017 vice president
[11:35.040 --> 11:39.580]  Michael Laney was convicted of sexually abusing a seven-year-old girl in
[11:39.580 --> 11:47.640]  2019 both actor producer Brian Peck and director Victor Salva were rehired by
[11:47.640 --> 11:52.760]  Disney after they served time for raping children from the set the
[11:52.760 --> 11:57.640]  subliminal sexualization of children has demonstrably been a part of Disney's
[11:57.640 --> 12:03.920]  work for generations embedded into their animations several whistleblowers have
[12:03.920 --> 12:08.400]  claimed that Disney has been used since its very beginning as a form of mind
[12:08.400 --> 12:14.080]  control and MKUltra most famously for their project monarch princess
[12:14.080 --> 12:20.080]  programming of little girls so it's really no surprise that Disney's
[12:20.080 --> 12:25.200]  corporate president admittedly wants to flood Disney stories with the so-called
[12:25.200 --> 12:33.240]  LGBTQIA agenda which we now understand to be code for pedophilia reporting for
[12:33.240 --> 12:38.760]  info wars this is Greg Reese so again you can find and share that video at
[12:38.760 --> 12:41.760]  banned at Dodd video remember to click the share button it gives you a disguised
[12:41.760 --> 12:46.600]  url links you can actually post it on big tech platforms if you just click the
[12:46.600 --> 12:50.720]  url at the top and try to paste that it will block you so you got to hit that
[12:50.720 --> 12:53.680]  share button these are little workarounds we have to figure out and I
[12:53.680 --> 12:57.480]  still you know I say this a lot but I still get people deeming me and stuff
[12:57.480 --> 13:00.520]  going hey I'm trying to post this and I can't so you got to hit the share button
[13:00.520 --> 13:05.240]  and that gives you that disguised link but this is also sort of indicative of
[13:05.240 --> 13:09.960]  the change that's gone on in a lot of things actually but primarily with the
[13:09.960 --> 13:14.640]  sexualization of children and stuff I mean I'm sure everybody remembers it was
[13:14.640 --> 13:18.160]  probably like the introduction to the idea of conspiracy theories or
[13:18.160 --> 13:21.720]  subliminal messages to a lot of people because it was real popular early on in
[13:21.720 --> 13:25.440]  the early internet days and it was sort of the Wild West you'd find these things
[13:25.440 --> 13:29.320]  it's like subliminal messages inside Disney movies and if you pause the movie
[13:29.320 --> 13:33.160]  at exactly the right time you'd see some dirty image in the background like from
[13:33.160 --> 13:37.480]  was that one called the the rescuers down under I think it was or maybe the
[13:37.480 --> 13:41.160]  first rescuers movie there's like actually a pornographic image in one of
[13:41.160 --> 13:46.640]  the frames as they speed down this slide thing or like the little mermaid they
[13:46.640 --> 13:50.640]  like see in this image if you pause it the line can you pause it right here it
[13:50.640 --> 13:54.800]  spells out the word sex in dust in the sky and it was like oh my god they're
[13:54.800 --> 13:57.880]  trying to brainwash us now it's just open now they're just like yeah we're
[13:57.880 --> 14:02.520]  trying to brainwash you all we're gonna put in sexual brainwashing into our
[14:02.520 --> 14:06.880]  cartoons now on purpose we're open about this we're spraying this round like it
[14:06.880 --> 14:12.240]  reminds me of of like the bohemian grove style Davos Bilderberg group or it's
[14:12.240 --> 14:15.400]  like back in the day you'd have to go to these websites where it's like here's the
[14:15.400 --> 14:18.960]  secret of the you know of the forces that rule the world they get together
[14:18.960 --> 14:22.800]  once a year to plan their year and it was like all hidden in disguise and now
[14:22.800 --> 14:26.360]  they're just like yeah we do this yeah we do this we're in charge we will
[14:26.360 --> 14:30.720]  dictate how the world will go and we get together once a year to plan out the
[14:30.720 --> 14:33.720]  next year's events like they're just completely open about it now it's a
[14:33.720 --> 14:38.360]  strange way of dealing with being exposed is just just doubling down just
[14:38.360 --> 14:43.840]  going all in on it it's very weird and it's not just the it's not just the sexual
[14:43.840 --> 14:49.640]  stuff with Disney it's the programming in general I used to talk about this more
[14:49.640 --> 14:53.000]  I haven't really experienced in a while but I experience it all the time in
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.880]  high school because friends of mine had little sisters that would watch the
[14:55.880 --> 15:00.880]  Disney Channel all the time and it programmed them to be the worst people
[15:00.880 --> 15:05.320]  like they're all bratty they were all kind of bitchy they were all just like
[15:05.320 --> 15:09.680]  like they were programmed like oh all the cool kids in the Disney Channel they
[15:09.680 --> 15:13.520]  they just like they talk back to the parents and you know they as long as
[15:13.520 --> 15:16.240]  you have this kind of like bitchy attitude it means you're right and you're
[15:16.240 --> 15:22.000]  cool and anybody who's who's against them is the stuffy no fun people and it
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.160]  was like it was a marked difference like you could tell you'd have friends and
[15:26.160 --> 15:29.240]  their little sisters that were like elementary school age you go those
[15:29.240 --> 15:34.280]  those girls watch Disney they watch the Disney Channel they watch way too much
[15:34.280 --> 15:38.200]  the Disney Channel because they're just mean they're just vicious and kind of
[15:38.200 --> 15:42.040]  spiteful and they think they're right and I think I think it's what brought us
[15:42.040 --> 15:45.960]  to AOC I think it's to blame for Alexandria Ocasio Cortez because it
[15:45.960 --> 15:50.080]  follows her around it's just this idea that like if you sound bitchy and can
[15:50.080 --> 15:54.000]  like have this attitude then you must be right screw what the facts are which
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  just the cool kids sound like jerks so go with them it's all programming
[15:59.000 --> 16:05.960]  want to thank folks that got part one in the three-part Founder series at 1776

[16:23.200 --> 16:28.720]  places for three times what we sold it we need to sell all ten thousand these
[16:28.720 --> 16:32.960]  very very quickly and I appreciate listeners are getting over half of them
[16:32.960 --> 16:36.280]  now I'd like to move them out very quickly I think they will sell out
[16:36.280 --> 16:41.080]  probably in five or six more days and without the last coin sale we would not
[16:41.080 --> 16:44.920]  be operating at the same capacity we'd have had to lay off a lot of people and

[19:06.600 --> 19:11.400]  Joe Biden, they along with many other new world order operatives have gone on
[19:11.400 --> 19:17.360]  national television and announced that we are now under a world government. They
[19:17.360 --> 19:22.120]  have a summit taking place right now in Dubai titled world government summit and
[19:22.120 --> 19:26.440]  they are announcing incredible tyranny everything we've talked about is now
[19:26.440 --> 19:31.120]  coming true and the globalists want to take us off air. Ladies and gentlemen we
[19:31.120 --> 19:35.720]  are running the biggest sale in the history of info wars right now in our

[20:04.600 --> 20:09.280]  world order it's Alex Jones.
[20:15.480 --> 20:18.960]  All right welcome back ladies and gentlemen we are talking about the Disney
[20:18.960 --> 20:25.440]  Company. Boy how far some things have fallen. Again the Greg Reese report is
[20:25.440 --> 20:29.800]  the dark side of Disney where he lays out so many examples of times Disney has
[20:29.800 --> 20:34.280]  been embroiled in scandals having to do with pedophilia with their own
[20:34.280 --> 20:40.960]  employees. But the post millennial has this story Jack Pasobic temporarily
[20:40.960 --> 20:46.360]  locked out of Twitter for calling it Disney groomers. I think so many of these
[20:46.360 --> 20:49.840]  stories they just if you really understand them you can really dig into
[20:49.840 --> 20:53.840]  them and you really you really get the full spectrum of what's going on here
[20:53.840 --> 20:57.680]  it's like they they tell you exactly where this world is going they tell you
[20:57.680 --> 21:02.840]  exactly why some of these moves are being made and what the end game for so
[21:02.840 --> 21:08.040]  much of what we see that seems bizarre or weird or inexplicable like this is one
[21:08.040 --> 21:11.560]  of those stories so Jack Pasobic was hit with a temporary Twitter lockout the
[21:11.560 --> 21:15.240]  first since he reported on Hunter Biden's salacious laptop in 2020 for
[21:15.240 --> 21:19.040]  sharing links to buy t-shirts and stickers and blazoned with a Disney logo
[21:19.040 --> 21:25.680]  reading boy boycott boycott groomers I think it's so interesting I've had
[21:25.680 --> 21:32.040]  guests on our show that had been kicked off of Twitter or YouTube with a claim
[21:32.040 --> 21:35.040]  of bullying they were bullying who were they bullying well they were bullying
[21:35.040 --> 21:39.320]  the deep state right they were making fun of or calling out deep state actors
[21:39.320 --> 21:44.400]  from the CIA or the FBI you can't bully them we can't bully the spy masters you
[21:44.400 --> 21:50.120]  can't bully the you know unelected permanent deep state operatives in our
[21:50.120 --> 21:53.920]  government that's that's bullying that's unfair they're a protected class I
[21:53.920 --> 21:59.880]  guess so just this is like this is why you don't give them these weapons this is
[21:59.880 --> 22:05.080]  why you don't hand over the censorship button to the establishment because this
[22:05.080 --> 22:10.040]  is the way they use it they'll lock you out even if you're a super famous like
[22:10.040 --> 22:13.240]  one of those popular people on Twitter I mean I'd have to say Jack Pasobic I mean
[22:13.240 --> 22:17.640]  he built his whole career off of Twitter and he has a powerful Twitter as it
[22:17.640 --> 22:20.680]  were right if he tweets something out if he wants to get a hashtag going he
[22:20.680 --> 22:25.320]  can he's got tons of followers so like forget you getting deleted right if you
[22:25.320 --> 22:28.640]  have a couple hundred followers never you're you'll be kicked off in an
[22:28.640 --> 22:33.400]  instant they'll do this for even the most prominent of right wing voices and
[22:33.400 --> 22:37.560]  in some ways some of the most moderate like Jack Pasobic so you give them this
[22:37.560 --> 22:41.520]  power you give them this censorship tool well it's all about bullying and it's
[22:41.520 --> 22:47.520]  all about protecting the unrepresented classes or whatever nonsense bull crap
[22:47.520 --> 22:50.960]  they use to justify their censorship and then how does the censorship get used it
[22:50.960 --> 22:55.960]  gets used to silence people speaking up against the most powerful people in the
[22:55.960 --> 22:59.360]  world whether corporations or governments you can't bully this
[22:59.360 --> 23:04.280]  multinational corporation how dare you you'll be deleted that's exactly what's
[23:04.280 --> 23:08.480]  happening and Jack Pasobic himself says that he says quote Elon Musk recently
[23:08.480 --> 23:11.480]  commented the corporations dictate policy on Twitter through add dollars
[23:11.480 --> 23:16.160]  so big told post millennial quote so it comes as no surprise that Twitter will
[23:16.160 --> 23:20.960]  censor you for criticizing one of the largest media companies in the world I'd
[23:20.960 --> 23:25.840]  say that's even an understatement what does Disney not own they own Fox they
[23:25.840 --> 23:32.480]  own like to every channel you can think of they own everything from Marvel movies
[23:32.480 --> 23:37.360]  to you know the Simpsons I mean every and everything in between but you can't
[23:37.360 --> 23:40.960]  but you can't criticize them you can't criticize them because everyone that
[23:40.960 --> 23:45.480]  works at Twitter of your that everyone that works at Disney obviously is is in
[23:45.480 --> 23:48.480]  favor of this but there you see the other little wrinkle in this the other
[23:48.480 --> 23:55.040]  little you know shadowy corner that this illuminates is the idea that these
[23:55.040 --> 23:58.880]  corporations they can dictate to their employees what they're allowed to say and
[23:58.880 --> 24:01.840]  what they're not allowed to say whether it's right or not they can because they
[24:01.840 --> 24:06.400]  have the power to do that now if you want to fire somebody because they're gay
[24:06.400 --> 24:10.000]  you can't do that that's discrimination but if you want to fire somebody because
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.840]  they express a conservative point of view that's still allowed because this is
[24:13.840 --> 24:21.560]  the way things always go so you've got a corporation that just like a like a you
[24:21.560 --> 24:28.000]  know 1950s sci-fi movie blob is just eating up every other form of
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.080]  entertainment in cooperation with so many I mean now you know the National
[24:32.080 --> 24:37.440]  Geographic magazine has like a little Disney section on the front cover that's
[24:37.440 --> 24:40.320]  like Disney we're partnered with Disney songs is Disney owned National
[24:40.320 --> 24:42.840]  Geographic now they're at least partnered with them so you have these
[24:42.840 --> 24:50.160]  conglomerates they just own huge chunks of information platforms or
[24:50.160 --> 24:58.360]  information like outlets and they get to try to dictate what states do what
[24:58.360 --> 25:04.120]  governments do what cities do and the people that work for them can't really
[25:04.120 --> 25:09.960]  question it or they might be fired if they try to speak up against it they'll
[25:09.960 --> 25:13.560]  at least suffer pushback and you know discrimination in the workplace from
[25:13.560 --> 25:18.840]  their fellow workers so they get to dictate to their people below them you
[25:18.840 --> 25:22.040]  know what they get to believe and then they get to wield their financial might
[25:22.040 --> 25:27.400]  against the states that try to pass laws through the actual process of passing
[25:27.400 --> 25:31.400]  laws through the you know by trying to exercise the will of the people through
[25:31.400 --> 25:39.200]  the representatives and of course Jack so it goes on to say this is clear
[25:39.200 --> 25:43.840]  retaliation for me leaking the internal employee forums at Disney showing many
[25:43.840 --> 25:48.360]  of their workers support the Florida anti-grooming bill so again it's like
[25:48.360 --> 25:51.400]  they get to speak with the voice of all of these people even though they're
[25:51.400 --> 25:54.800]  actually contradicting what these people believe what their employees believe
[25:54.800 --> 26:00.040]  they get to supersede that they get to dictate what the reality is and you may
[26:00.040 --> 26:07.120]  get fired from your job if you speak out too much against it again this is just
[26:07.120 --> 26:10.800]  you know one of many topics having to do with transgenderism here's another one
[26:10.800 --> 26:14.880]  from the Daily Mail came out today I believe maybe it was yesterday but here
[26:14.880 --> 26:19.480]  it is women can be stripped searched by trans officers who were born male says
[26:19.480 --> 26:24.760]  police female suspects can be stripped searched by male police officers I'll
[26:24.760 --> 26:29.680]  just change the words around here just to just to do away with you know the
[26:29.680 --> 26:34.600]  confusion that they're trying to add here it's male police officers okay and
[26:34.600 --> 26:40.440]  could be accused of a hate crime if they object yeah so this this man with a
[26:40.440 --> 26:44.760]  beard and a dress is going to strip search you ma'am and if you don't like
[26:44.760 --> 26:53.280]  that you might get a hate crime charge and of course we've covered we covered
[26:53.280 --> 27:01.000]  it on American Journal earlier this week with the new conversion therapy things
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.440]  that are going on see this is this is a happening in the UK where they're trying
[27:04.440 --> 27:08.400]  to pass a they may have already passed it I think they did pass it I think they
[27:08.400 --> 27:11.760]  took away the transgender aspect of it but they passed an anti-grooming bill
[27:11.760 --> 27:16.920]  but it was an anti-conversion bill basically if you have a kid that says
[27:16.920 --> 27:20.480]  he's gay and you try to tell him that that's a sin and try to tell him that
[27:20.480 --> 27:25.680]  it's not moral and try to convince him that you know for the sake of his soul
[27:25.680 --> 27:30.480]  he shouldn't give in to the temptations of his body like you'll that's hate
[27:30.480 --> 27:34.520]  that's a hate crime now but it never goes the other way does it it's not it's
[27:34.520 --> 27:38.400]  not the other way around so right now we're trying to pass laws just to stop
[27:38.400 --> 27:42.480]  people from talking about sex with little children and you just always push
[27:42.480 --> 27:50.000]  back oh how dare you but if you want to try to stop kids from being trans or
[27:50.000 --> 27:56.360]  being gay then that's a crime so it's very convenient for our opponents I
[27:56.360 --> 28:01.560]  guess you'd say to have this moral framework that serves every aspect of a
[28:01.560 --> 28:05.680]  religion but because it's godless and because it doesn't have a holy book then
[28:05.680 --> 28:09.200]  they claim it's not a religion and it's just basic morality that has to be
[28:09.200 --> 28:14.720]  enforced by the state it's just it's a very convenient it's always very
[28:14.720 --> 28:18.680]  convenient I mean all of these stories they all have the same sort of through
[28:18.680 --> 28:22.840]  line right where it's like if you agree with what we want then you're allowed to
[28:22.840 --> 28:26.000]  say it you're promoted for saying it you'll be celebrated for saying it but
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.440]  if you disagree with us then anything you say about this is is a hate crime it's
[28:30.440 --> 28:34.440]  hate speech and you will be destroyed for it so if you want to announce is
[28:34.440 --> 28:38.320]  happening in Canada I'll get back to it on the other side but if you want to tell
[28:38.320 --> 28:42.760]  kids to be gay tell kids to be trans and indoctrinate them into this religion
[28:42.760 --> 28:46.480]  that's allowed because it's not a religion in the classic sense but if you
[28:46.480 --> 28:50.680]  do want to convince kids of your moral framework then you're trying to convert
[28:50.680 --> 28:54.360]  them you will be stopped it's a hate crime how dare you prepare to go to jail
[28:54.360 --> 28:59.280]  we'll cover what Canada is doing on this front on the other side stay with us in
[28:59.280 --> 29:06.480]  December of 2021 info wars offered the first in a three-part series the 1776

[32:00.040 --> 32:04.720]  and I'm not bragging when I say it it's just true that info wars is seen by the
[32:04.720 --> 32:11.840]  globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist
[32:11.840 --> 32:17.680]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program and man our work is
[32:17.680 --> 32:23.160]  really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever

[33:35.720 --> 33:40.720]  terms of economic financial food supply collapse but let's keep talking about
[33:40.720 --> 33:45.120]  the moral collapse while we do is these things are happening simultaneously
[33:45.120 --> 33:48.280]  I was gonna talk about what's happening with the french presidential election
[33:48.280 --> 33:54.520]  really unexpected moves by marine le pan and yeah just a lot just a lot still
[33:54.520 --> 33:57.520]  talked about we'll be opening up your phone calls in the second hour of this
[33:57.520 --> 34:03.320]  program here's what's happening in canada from fox news thousands of
[34:03.320 --> 34:07.680]  churches raise alarm about scope of new canadian quote conversion therapy ban
[34:07.680 --> 34:11.600]  thousands of clergy in north america devoted their sermons on sunday to
[34:11.600 --> 34:16.960]  affirming biblical sexual morality in response to a new canadian law that some
[34:16.960 --> 34:22.120]  warn could effectively criminalize such teachings an initiative begun by liberty
[34:22.120 --> 34:26.680]  coalition canada and promulgated in the united states by pastor john mcarthur of
[34:26.680 --> 34:30.440]  los angeles secured the support of more than four thousand christian pastors who
[34:30.440 --> 34:33.960]  publicly expressed their willingness to protest from the pulpit regarding bill
[34:33.960 --> 34:38.680]  c4 fox news digital has confirmed the controversial legislation which went
[34:38.680 --> 34:42.400]  into effect january eighth after being fast tracked through the canadian
[34:42.400 --> 34:46.920]  parliament in december without extensive debate describes as a myth the belief
[34:46.920 --> 34:52.000]  that had heterosexuality in cisgender identity are preferable counseling that
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.240]  does not align with such a worldview now carries a potential five-year jail
[34:56.240 --> 35:05.080]  sentence i'm not sure how secure the canadian not what do they have a
[35:05.080 --> 35:08.720]  charter of rights right the canadian charter instead of a bill of rights they
[35:08.720 --> 35:13.760]  have a charter that was written somewhat recently i don't know what it says in
[35:13.760 --> 35:19.160]  particular about freedom of religion but i'm pretty sure in america the first
[35:19.160 --> 35:24.960]  amendment is the only weapon you need to stop what's happening around the
[35:24.960 --> 35:28.960]  country in places like new jersey and places that are going the opposite
[35:28.960 --> 35:33.200]  direction of florida where they're putting it into law that you have to
[35:33.200 --> 35:38.560]  teach this sort of stuff you have to understand that this is a religion you
[35:38.560 --> 35:42.600]  have to understand that this is not a question of facts it's a question of
[35:42.600 --> 35:48.880]  morality it's a question of religion i mean it really is question of the soul
[35:48.880 --> 35:52.320]  it's question of sin it's question of righteousness like it's a question of
[35:52.320 --> 35:57.320]  what is good and moral and so what they're saying is that your morality
[35:57.320 --> 36:03.320]  since it's based on a book since it has a bible and since it's based on you know
[36:03.320 --> 36:07.680]  religious revelation that's a religion and you're not allowed to teach it but
[36:07.680 --> 36:12.120]  our morality which completely and diametrically opposes your morality
[36:12.120 --> 36:16.680]  it's just we just came up with it so it's good and that's why it's correct and
[36:16.680 --> 36:21.760]  that's why it should be taught and must be taught at every level of society so
[36:21.760 --> 36:26.000]  don't you understand that what they're pushing is in all aspects a religion
[36:26.000 --> 36:35.400]  from the conversion aspect to the you know evangelicalism of the lgbt
[36:35.400 --> 36:39.760]  community right trying to trying to spread your morality trying to bring
[36:39.760 --> 36:45.200]  people into your side to express and live by your morality it's it's a religion
[36:45.200 --> 36:49.960]  it's just a religion that has no god because they worship themselves critics
[36:49.960 --> 36:53.280]  claim the language of this canadian bill is overly broad and could even encompass
[36:53.280 --> 36:57.240]  private conversations several pastors including some who've recently been in
[36:57.240 --> 37:00.680]  prison in canada for keeping their churches open in defiance of government
[37:00.680 --> 37:03.880]  health orders explain to fox news that they believe the scope of the new law
[37:03.880 --> 37:08.800]  could open the door to religious persecution leading the protest against
[37:08.800 --> 37:11.720]  the bill in the united states is pastor john mcarthur who's grace community
[37:11.720 --> 37:14.400]  church in los angeles won an eight hundred thousand dollar settlement in
[37:14.400 --> 37:18.320]  september after tussling with state and county authorities for continuing to
[37:18.320 --> 37:22.360]  congregate in defiance of the government mcarthur told fox news that he believes
[37:22.360 --> 37:26.600]  widespread sexual immorality is evidence of divine judgment on a culture in
[37:26.600 --> 37:30.640]  predicted increased efforts to silence those who speak out against it saying
[37:30.640 --> 37:33.480]  quote ultimately the dissenters the ones who will not cave in are going to be
[37:33.480 --> 37:37.760]  those who are faithful to the bible he says and that and that's what's already
[37:37.760 --> 37:41.280]  leading to laws made against doing what we are commanded to do in the scripture
[37:41.280 --> 37:46.480]  which is a which is to confront that sin it's just going to escalate criminal
[37:46.480 --> 37:53.960]  conduct they're calling it if canadian pastors continued to actually promote the
[37:53.960 --> 37:58.440]  morality in their bible it's contradicted by the state morality so you
[37:58.440 --> 38:01.480]  can't you can't preach on that anymore what they're trying to tell people and
[38:01.480 --> 38:06.080]  of course this is already taking place in the uk as we as we pointed out they've
[38:06.080 --> 38:11.560]  passed the conversion law banning conversion therapy but only in one
[38:11.560 --> 38:15.880]  direction right only if you're trying to get people to be moral in a biblical
[38:15.880 --> 38:21.120]  sense not the other way around but also in finland I believe it was there was
[38:21.120 --> 38:26.000]  somebody who was charged with hate crime with a hate with hate speech and
[38:26.000 --> 38:34.240]  also happened in Ireland where a diner I think it was had a piece of scripture on
[38:34.240 --> 38:37.720]  the wall had like a piece of art with a with a proverb on it they were charged
[38:37.720 --> 38:41.640]  with hate speech and they were forced to take it down because quoting the bible
[38:41.640 --> 38:45.480]  is hate speech now apparently so and that's what happened in finland where I
[38:45.480 --> 38:49.680]  think somebody I think it was like an MEP or an MP member of parliament in
[38:49.680 --> 38:53.520]  finland quoted the bible and they charged with a hate crime for it so
[38:53.520 --> 38:56.880]  that's where we're going that's where we're headed so instead of being ruled
[38:56.880 --> 39:04.000]  by a religion with a morality based in biblical revelation will be a theocracy
[39:04.000 --> 39:10.280]  run by people who are completely godless and come up with whatever you know
[39:10.280 --> 39:14.280]  moral framework allows them to do whatever they want and not serve the
[39:14.280 --> 39:21.840]  consequences pretty horrific stuff but not unexpected not exactly new as we
[39:21.840 --> 39:27.560]  move into this next stage but I think understanding it as a religion and using
[39:27.560 --> 39:30.920]  the first amendment to prevent the religious indoctrination into this
[39:30.920 --> 39:38.960]  satanic cult is probably the best way to go you know I had another another note
[39:38.960 --> 39:43.680]  it was actually from weekend before last it was about Ukraine war and we'll get
[39:43.680 --> 39:47.000]  into Ukraine in just a second we'll also again get into France and just the
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.640]  total collapse of the first world as we crumble into mismanagement but it was
[39:52.640 --> 39:57.800]  funny because it turns out that the family that I grew up as next-door
[39:57.800 --> 40:02.320]  neighbors with my call all through my life this next-door neighbor had kids
[40:02.320 --> 40:06.120]  similar in age to us we're really good friends and hadn't seen him in a long
[40:06.120 --> 40:10.960]  time but I saw him my sister's baby shower and the mom mom goes so what's
[40:10.960 --> 40:15.720]  happened in Ukraine it's it's all about pedophiles right I'm like oh you get it
[40:15.720 --> 40:22.160]  people get it and it really is amazing seeing things you only find on info
[40:22.160 --> 40:29.040]  wars ideas revelations you'd only ever find on shows like the Alex Jones show
[40:29.040 --> 40:33.160]  or websites like info wars it's proliferated and people just know this
[40:33.160 --> 40:36.760]  now even if they don't know the details there's like yeah Ukraine it's like
[40:36.760 --> 40:40.040]  where they get like where the pedophiles get their human slaves from right like
[40:40.040 --> 40:44.960]  they're trying to protect the pedophiles like Hunter Biden from taking women
[40:44.960 --> 40:48.400]  from Ukraine it's like you know without getting into the details yes yeah
[40:48.400 --> 40:54.360]  basically yes basically it's it's it's the pedophiles using Ukraine as a as a
[40:54.360 --> 41:00.280]  shield using the Ukrainian people as cannon fodder to prevent the attack
[41:00.280 --> 41:05.480]  against themselves so man as much as you know we read the news every single day
[41:05.480 --> 41:10.760]  I mean it's just just infinite disasters infinite horror instant infinite terror
[41:10.760 --> 41:20.920]  coming from the new world order and their their globalist compatriots you have
[41:20.920 --> 41:26.560]  to understand that what we have done at info wars has changed the entire world
[41:26.560 --> 41:29.600]  and I was even thinking about this because one thing I like to do is just
[41:29.600 --> 41:34.280]  I'll go down a YouTube rabbit hole and I'll be watching like late night shows
[41:34.280 --> 41:37.480]  from the early 90s I don't know why I'm watching Norm McDonald clips and
[41:37.480 --> 41:44.680]  suddenly I'm watching you know the late night show from like 1992 and it's kind
[41:44.680 --> 41:48.080]  of funny because you know it's all about popular culture it's all about
[41:48.080 --> 41:52.680]  celebrity and they're saying names that I've never heard never in my life I mean
[41:52.680 --> 41:57.520]  this is within my lifetime right I was born in 89 so 1992 I was I was three old
[41:57.520 --> 42:01.520]  kid but it's like I don't recognize a single name and you realize that all
[42:01.520 --> 42:05.360]  these people that are starring in movies and you hear their names over and over
[42:05.360 --> 42:08.200]  again you know exactly who they are and what they look like and what they do like
[42:08.200 --> 42:11.160]  they're they're dust in the wind man five years from now nobody's gonna even
[42:11.160 --> 42:15.160]  know who they are you can watch episodes of 30 rock 30 rock
[42:15.160 --> 42:18.720]  how long ago 30 rock was not that long ago but go watch an episode of 30 rock
[42:18.720 --> 42:23.440]  and every single joke is outdated the reason I'm saying this is because then
[42:23.440 --> 42:28.400]  you take a look at somebody like Alex Jones people will be saying 9-11 was an
[42:28.400 --> 42:33.360]  inside job long long after Alex Jones is gone right people will be spreading the
[42:33.360 --> 42:39.120]  ideas that Alex Jones has ignited for decades if not centuries if we even make
[42:39.120 --> 42:45.240]  it that far so info wars has changed the world info wars has exposed the dark side
[42:45.240 --> 42:50.000]  when they thought they could get away with it without ever being shown by the
[42:50.000 --> 42:55.000]  light of day info wars has changed the entire world and that's thanks to you the

[47:25.800 --> 47:28.480]  now I'll be taking your calls throughout the second hour the number to dial is
[47:28.480 --> 47:39.240]  1-877-789-2539 that's 1-877-789-2539 you know when you look back at 2016 and
[47:39.240 --> 47:42.240]  you realize that that's when a lot of this stuff went off the rails right
[47:42.240 --> 47:47.160]  prior to 2016 a lot of people thought things were kind of normal and then
[47:47.160 --> 47:52.440]  2016 came around came around and everything just went off-road it just
[47:52.440 --> 47:59.280]  would just be exploded and it was insane and the reason for that is pretty
[47:59.280 --> 48:03.480]  simple I think the reason is because for the first time in a very long time
[48:03.480 --> 48:08.080]  there was a clear distinction between nationalism and globalism because it
[48:08.080 --> 48:12.520]  wasn't just Trump that brought about all of this change it was brexit as well and
[48:12.520 --> 48:17.520]  it was a number of other movements inspired by brexit to essentially free
[48:17.520 --> 48:23.200]  themselves from the oversight of the European Union and you really get down
[48:23.200 --> 48:29.640]  to what what inspired the new world order globalist to really hit the pedal to
[48:29.640 --> 48:32.880]  the metal on 2016 because they had an option they could have backed off a
[48:32.880 --> 48:38.240]  little bit they could have tempered their behavior slightly to try to sort of
[48:38.240 --> 48:42.280]  recede in the shadows and go no no we're not trying to go globalism global
[48:42.280 --> 48:47.080]  government that's crazy no no way yeah have your little nationalist fun and
[48:47.080 --> 48:49.040]  we're gonna work behind the scenes they could have done that they could have
[48:49.040 --> 48:52.360]  backed off a little bit but they didn't they doubled down they saw it as a
[48:52.360 --> 48:59.040]  threat and they said okay we have to slam the slam the cage shut now or it's
[48:59.040 --> 49:04.000]  all over and the way I always phrase it is like you know humanity is this tiger
[49:04.000 --> 49:09.600]  that they're trying to catch in a cage and they'd much rather just have the
[49:09.600 --> 49:13.360]  tiger wander into the cage and they can slam the door down that was and if you
[49:13.360 --> 49:16.840]  look at the Rockefeller document by the lockstep document that's that was their
[49:16.840 --> 49:21.960]  preferred outcome that was their preferred situation they called it
[49:21.960 --> 49:25.960]  clever together the idea was that willingly people would be led into the
[49:25.960 --> 49:29.520]  cage of globalism and they could lock it without people even knowing they were
[49:29.520 --> 49:34.720]  being trapped and so what happened here is the tiger he's almost in the cage
[49:34.720 --> 49:37.360]  they're almost there he's sticking his head in and then he looks around and
[49:37.360 --> 49:41.840]  realizes it's a cage and goes oh I don't want to go in there and the hunters
[49:41.840 --> 49:46.480]  the globalist instead of going okay well we'll we'll get him next time right we
[49:46.480 --> 49:48.960]  don't want to spook him we don't want to scare him instead they just reached out
[49:48.960 --> 49:51.480]  and tried to grab the tiger and just yank it into the cage that's what's
[49:51.480 --> 49:55.360]  happened since 2016 is they're just like oh you don't want to come willingly then
[49:55.360 --> 49:59.600]  we're gonna make you and we're gonna silence you if you disagree and so that
[49:59.600 --> 50:02.760]  was the tactic they went with and it doesn't look like it's going so well
[50:02.760 --> 50:06.520]  they've had some victories I mean they have control of every mainstream
[50:06.520 --> 50:09.880]  media outlet they have control of big tech and they have control of the
[50:09.880 --> 50:12.960]  government and the deep state the military industrial complex you'd
[50:12.960 --> 50:16.760]  expected to be pretty easy for them unfortunately as much as they like to
[50:16.760 --> 50:21.120]  think of themselves as gods they're not gods they're human beings and they have
[50:21.120 --> 50:26.040]  to contend with human will around the world and it looks like we're seeing
[50:26.040 --> 50:31.080]  another expression of this in France Info Wars has the story French had to
[50:31.080 --> 50:36.280]  polls as Macron on shaky ground but reports of lower than expected turnout
[50:36.280 --> 50:40.840]  today Sunday French citizens flooded the polling stations albeit what's so far
[50:40.840 --> 50:44.600]  looking at like lower than expected numbers for first-round voting and what's
[50:44.600 --> 50:47.600]  shaping up to be possibly the country's most consequential and impactful
[50:47.600 --> 50:51.400]  election determining its future trajectory in decades given it pits
[50:51.400 --> 50:56.720]  Davos crowd pet and former Rothschild's banker Emmanuel Macron against outspoken
[50:56.720 --> 51:02.920]  nationalist Marine Le Pen and again this is just a choice between nationalism and
[51:02.920 --> 51:08.080]  globalism that's what it represents and you can see how furious they are to not
[51:08.080 --> 51:12.960]  allow the French to express their nationalist tendencies 48 million
[51:12.960 --> 51:16.000]  eligible voters can choose between 12 candidates with favored incumbent
[51:16.000 --> 51:21.520]  Macron no longer considered a shoe-in but looking increasingly on shaking ground
[51:21.520 --> 51:28.840]  as he seeks a second five-year turn turnouts a little bit low but one of
[51:28.840 --> 51:34.760]  the interesting things about Marine Le Pen is that it's young people that are
[51:34.760 --> 51:41.800]  flocking to hurt typically like in America the globalist politicians that
[51:41.800 --> 51:46.600]  are able to present themselves very well and they have the the fawning love of
[51:46.600 --> 51:50.440]  the mainstream media typically older people who still have faith in the
[51:50.440 --> 51:57.720]  institutions that go along with with those people while you know the younger
[51:57.720 --> 52:04.160]  people with the minds completely warped by the Daily Show and all these other
[52:04.160 --> 52:11.840]  pseudo news stations they they they tend to go along with the globalist agenda
[52:11.840 --> 52:16.440]  but in in France is the other way around I think I'm gonna mess up how I said
[52:16.440 --> 52:20.200]  that I think you get what I'm saying that typically in America the younger you
[52:20.200 --> 52:24.360]  go the more globalist they are the more communistic they are the more willing to
[52:24.360 --> 52:28.080]  surrender national sovereignty to international coalitions but it's the
[52:28.080 --> 52:30.600]  opposite in France and it's a very interesting thing and again you can see
[52:30.600 --> 52:35.400]  the panic in the words of the globalists here's how Politico chose to report
[52:35.400 --> 52:39.480]  this the White House has freaked out that Putin's next big win could be in
[52:39.480 --> 52:44.880]  Paris that's right voting for national sovereignty is really voting for Putin
[52:44.880 --> 52:51.080]  far right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen they say is is voting for
[52:51.080 --> 52:56.120]  her is essentially voting for Vladimir Putin they say a possible victory by
[52:56.120 --> 53:01.040]  Le Pen a Putin sympathizer could destabilize the Western coalition against
[53:01.040 --> 53:05.280]  Moscow upending France's role as a leading European power and potentially
[53:05.280 --> 53:09.800]  giving other NATO leaders cold feet about staying in the alliance that's right
[53:09.800 --> 53:14.080]  if we don't go to World War three in Ukraine it's the death of democracy or
[53:14.080 --> 53:20.320]  if you know Victor Orban gets duly elected by the citizens of Hungary that's
[53:20.320 --> 53:24.760]  the death of democracy or if you vote for Marine Le Pen that's also the death of
[53:24.760 --> 53:30.920]  democracy worldwide folks are you panicked yet we have to live we have to
[53:30.920 --> 53:34.480]  live in the world of these people's delusions we have to act like their own
[53:34.480 --> 53:39.600]  paranoid schizophrenic imaginings our reality and and treat them as such we
[53:39.600 --> 53:43.840]  refuse to here in info wars here's how AP News reported it French polls Macron
[53:43.840 --> 53:48.640]  far left rival Marine Le Pen to face runoff French president Emmanuel Macron
[53:48.640 --> 53:52.400]  and far left far right nationalist Marine Le Pen are heading for another winner
[53:52.400 --> 53:55.520]  takes all runoff in the country's presidential election pulling agencies
[53:55.520 --> 53:59.760]  projected Sunday as the fierce political rivals with sharply opposing visions
[53:59.760 --> 54:03.320]  for France pulled clear of 10 other candidates in the first round of voting
[54:03.320 --> 54:07.520]  if confirmed by official vote counts later Sunday the initial projections
[54:07.520 --> 54:11.360]  mean France is teeing up for a repeat of the 2017 head-to-head contest that
[54:11.360 --> 54:14.600]  turned the centrist Macron into France's youngest president but there's no
[54:14.600 --> 54:18.080]  guarantee that this time the outcome will be the same they say Macron for
[54:18.080 --> 54:21.920]  months has looked like a shoe-in to become France's first president in 20
[54:21.920 --> 54:26.720]  years to win a second term but national rally leader Le Pen in a late surge
[54:26.720 --> 54:30.320]  tapped into the foremost issue on many French voters mind the soaring cost of
[54:30.320 --> 54:33.920]  food gas and heating due to rising inflation and the repercussions of
[54:33.920 --> 54:40.240]  Western sanctions on Russia translation Marine Le Pen is actually pulling ahead
[54:40.240 --> 54:45.240]  in the a French election by reflecting and showing that she cares about the
[54:45.240 --> 54:48.840]  cares of the French people and this is unacceptable to the globalist know the
[54:48.840 --> 54:54.160]  French people the European people the American people are simply pawns to be
[54:54.160 --> 55:00.800]  abused and exploited for their own you know international schemes now looks
[55:00.800 --> 55:07.080]  like they're on more and more or less dead heat head-to-head and it looks like
[55:07.080 --> 55:11.360]  the number is even like the difference between them is getting smaller as they
[55:11.360 --> 55:17.200]  continue to count votes and you can see again how panicked to the establishment
[55:17.200 --> 55:23.280]  is with paragraphs like this some of her defeated rivals Marine Le Pen's were so
[55:23.280 --> 55:26.800]  alarmed by the possibility of Le Pen beating Macron in the presidential run-off
[55:26.800 --> 55:30.480]  that they urged their supporters Sunday to shift their second round votes to the
[55:30.480 --> 55:37.280]  incumbent Melanchon or to the incumbent Macron Melanchon was another one of
[55:37.280 --> 55:42.960]  these potential presidential candidates addressing supporters who sometimes
[55:42.960 --> 55:48.040]  shed tears repeated three times that Le Pen shouldn't get one single vote and
[55:48.040 --> 55:51.400]  describing herself as profoundly worried defeated conservative candidate
[55:51.400 --> 55:56.760]  Valerie Peccary's warned of quote the chaos that would ensue if Le Pen was
[55:56.760 --> 56:00.920]  elected saying the far-right leader has never been so close to power because
[56:00.920 --> 56:07.400]  said she would vote for Macron in the run-off again they don't they don't talk
[56:07.400 --> 56:10.920]  about her ideas they don't say here's why she's wrong about this here's why
[56:10.920 --> 56:16.920]  this is what's best for the French people it's all paranoid fanaticism it's
[56:16.920 --> 56:27.560]  all just imagined what the word is just like to terror they're just all so
[56:27.560 --> 56:31.160]  scared it's not like well look you know you got two opposing options here and
[56:31.160 --> 56:33.800]  actually what's best for the French people is to go with this it's just like
[56:33.800 --> 56:38.400]  they're just crying and they're just like I'm so scared we're so scared of Marine
[56:38.400 --> 56:42.640]  Le Pen getting power like why she's a nationalist you're a French person she
[56:42.640 --> 56:46.080]  wants what's best for the French people there's like you don't understand she is
[56:46.080 --> 56:51.920]  Putin she is Putin and if she wins democracy is dead it's all just just
[56:51.920 --> 56:57.520]  paranoid fervor and Godspeed to Marine Le Pen and you can even see in the videos
[56:57.520 --> 57:02.000]  of Marine Le Pen and her supporters how young her audience leans let's go down
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.120]  to clip number five here's Marine Le Pen being mobbed by her youthful
[57:05.120 --> 57:08.920]  supporters I believe this was yesterday let's watch
[57:21.160 --> 57:25.920]  yeah this woman wins it's the death of democracy folks you can't have a leader

[57:31.040 --> 57:38.200]  go around in armored cars from you know barbed wire enclosed state houses to you
[57:38.200 --> 57:44.000]  know wall protected mansions and have to be Rothschild bankers and globalist

[1:01:19.080 --> 1:01:23.920]  Carlos of Canada shout out to him been on my heart my mind and my prayers man
[1:01:23.920 --> 1:01:31.280]  always a cool cat to listen to also yeah dude you had mentioned a while back
[1:01:31.280 --> 1:01:37.480]  the mask how sophisticated this entire thing is I'm home school and my girls
[1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:46.360]  now the and I heard a report couple days ago with with the mask and not being
[1:01:46.360 --> 1:01:51.880]  able to speak and so many kids can't even have eye contact it is amazing how
[1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:57.880]  sophisticated is it is and there is intentional depression there aside from
[1:01:57.880 --> 1:02:02.400]  globally there's intentional depression I mean so many people are slouching I
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:07.560]  still have to tell my neighbors be doing well I'm halfway death you know flying
[1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:14.760]  in helicopters good old times in Iraq death I can't see you know and I can't
[1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:22.600]  hear unless I'm looking at your mouth right yeah it's far out yeah I mean the
[1:02:22.600 --> 1:02:26.520]  the stories are undeniable now I mean there's this story after story after
[1:02:26.520 --> 1:02:30.200]  story of the damage this has done to kids and of course you know I mean
[1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:33.720]  obviously it's gonna be the case obviously this is the point and remember
[1:02:33.720 --> 1:02:40.440]  when they talk about the measures that they took it wasn't like what the the
[1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:45.880]  medical reality didn't determine what they endorsed or what they put on you it
[1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:50.400]  was what you were willing to accept right they chose that six foot distance
[1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:54.560]  because to them it was far enough away that it would separate people from each
[1:02:54.560 --> 1:02:58.800]  other but it wasn't so far that people would just go and I'm not gonna do that
[1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:03.000]  right they they sort of like focus tested this they go okay we tell people 12
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:07.800]  feet that's kind of impossible they just can't do it so we can't do 12 feet 10
[1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:10.560]  feet even that's kind of pushing it we'll go with six feet because we think
[1:03:10.560 --> 1:03:15.600]  six feet is the longest we can go without people like pushing back against
[1:03:15.600 --> 1:03:19.040]  us same thing with the lockdowns and everything it wasn't you know here's
[1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:23.960]  what's best for you medically it was psychologically how far can we push
[1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:30.120]  people before they snap I mean it's all very dialed in to exactly how far they
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:36.000]  can push us before we push back and and they're very good at it flex super good
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:41.520]  at it you're smarter than me and we're what potentially eight people removed
[1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:47.840]  from anyone famous so eight double it let's just call it 16 from everyone
[1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:54.000]  worldwide so we're essentially you know and what you exhale what 16 feet in
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:57.040]  front of you there's no way that any of us you're not gonna catch everything
[1:03:57.040 --> 1:04:01.880]  this out there I get sick everyone gets sick everyone gets sick and see there's
[1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:05.080]  another thing I think that that you know what I mentioned intentional
[1:04:05.080 --> 1:04:11.000]  depression is is how it makes I see so many people slouching and it just makes
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:14.320]  me think of exercise of course I always want to take about it talk about
[1:04:14.320 --> 1:04:19.600]  exercise I'm gonna meet head but you can exercise while watching TV right you
[1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:26.120]  should be because there's there's a you know the what was it you had said some
[1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:32.360]  mass paranoid psychosis where you're scared of someone right next to oh come
[1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:36.960]  on come over here let me put you in a headlock buddy right come on right no
[1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:40.560]  it's true I mean it's just like it's just cult programming on the most basic
[1:04:40.560 --> 1:04:44.920]  level it works on an individual also works on society and if you look at a
[1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:48.040]  cult or you even look at just an abusive relationship the first thing they do is
[1:04:48.040 --> 1:04:51.560]  they separate from you from your family separate you from your friends separate
[1:04:51.560 --> 1:04:54.920]  you from anything that makes you strong and upstanding so you're weak and
[1:04:54.920 --> 1:05:01.080]  pathetic and can be manipulated so when I first started taking survival skill
[1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:05.220]  basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like you
[1:05:05.220 --> 1:05:09.440]  wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your
[1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:12.760]  show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original survival
[1:05:12.760 --> 1:05:16.680]  shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out
[1:05:16.680 --> 1:05:19.720]  with that you have you know with a deeper source you know and I got really
[1:05:19.720 --> 1:05:24.360]  excited about that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to
[1:05:24.360 --> 1:05:28.760]  like literally like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again
[1:05:28.760 --> 1:05:32.960]  I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of
[1:05:32.960 --> 1:05:36.520]  years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your
[1:05:36.520 --> 1:05:39.880]  supplements there they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one I like
[1:05:39.880 --> 1:05:43.640]  recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's
[1:05:43.640 --> 1:05:47.320]  amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[1:05:47.320 --> 1:05:51.120]  that's a break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to
[1:05:51.120 --> 1:05:55.440]  take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother I thank you so
[1:05:55.440 --> 1:05:58.800]  much your call and Godspeed
[1:06:04.680 --> 1:06:10.680]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming
[1:06:10.680 --> 1:06:15.560]  to you live from the front lines of the info
[1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:19.720]  all right welcome back ladies and gentlemen here's Smith sitting in for
[1:06:19.720 --> 1:06:24.760]  Alex Jones on this the 10th of April 2022 we'll go out to your phone calls in
[1:06:24.760 --> 1:06:31.840]  just a second but of course COVID is sort of making a comeback there was like
[1:06:31.840 --> 1:06:35.160]  a couple week period where you didn't see a lot of headlines about COVID but
[1:06:35.160 --> 1:06:40.520]  that is over I guess as they start a new push I mean I'm even a little bit
[1:06:40.520 --> 1:06:47.240]  suspicious of this push in and of itself Nancy Pelosi, Merrick Garland all coming
[1:06:47.240 --> 1:06:53.120]  down with COVID at the same time you know it kind of reminds me of Justin
[1:06:53.120 --> 1:06:57.280]  Trudeau coming down with COVID the incident that the trucker protest came
[1:06:57.280 --> 1:07:01.160]  about oh I'm oh I've got COVID sorry I can't be near the protest I have to
[1:07:01.160 --> 1:07:06.120]  sequester myself away in a secret hideout so it's like what's what's really
[1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:08.920]  happening here all these deep-state actors all the sudden came down with
[1:07:08.920 --> 1:07:12.560]  COVID and have to go off the grid for five days is something about to be
[1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:18.120]  unleashed that they know about and are prepared for and we're not I don't know
[1:07:18.120 --> 1:07:24.320]  but I do know that the information about the vaccine and its ineffectiveness is
[1:07:24.320 --> 1:07:29.280]  becoming really too much for people to ignore and I want to get into just some
[1:07:29.280 --> 1:07:35.160]  of that there's a pretty amazing video by Dr. Peter McCullough a speech he gave
[1:07:35.160 --> 1:07:42.960]  at Optimist in Bahamas it's a group a gathering called Optimist about the
[1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:50.880]  VAERS reporting system and what it's showing of course it was at the beginning
[1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:56.400]  of January that all of this sort of started to fall apart that the vaccinated
[1:07:56.400 --> 1:08:00.560]  variant Omicron came about where it turned out you were actually more likely
[1:08:00.560 --> 1:08:04.600]  to get it if you were vaccinated and it looks like it was first detected in a
[1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:10.920]  vaccinated person and now we're seeing more and more evidence of this as well
[1:08:10.920 --> 1:08:16.120]  as of course the massive side effects and deaths that we're experiencing 40%
[1:08:16.120 --> 1:08:20.760]  growth according to some insurance companies although I'm sure that number
[1:08:20.760 --> 1:08:24.280]  is higher by now but I want to take you through this little chart that somebody
[1:08:24.280 --> 1:08:31.680]  posted on Twitter that shows the Pfizer trial as it took place so it's the six
[1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:39.520]  month safety and efficacy of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and it breaks up you
[1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:43.160]  know these everybody knows how you do a scientific study like this right you
[1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:46.800]  have the placebo group and the group that actually gets the medicine and
[1:08:46.800 --> 1:08:49.840]  there's they're not supposed to know whether they're getting the placebo or
[1:08:49.840 --> 1:08:57.640]  not and so you've got 45,000 plus screened 44,000 plus randomized figures
[1:08:57.640 --> 1:09:03.240]  about half of them go into the Pfizer where they actually get the medicine
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:05.640]  the other half goes into the placebo where they're told you might have the
[1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:08.840]  medicine you might not but really they're just injected with saline solution or
[1:09:08.840 --> 1:09:14.360]  something like that so you've got 22,000 going into Pfizer 22,000 going into
[1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:19.520]  placebo you have about 55 of those withdrawing after the first round from
[1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:24.640]  the Pfizer cohort and about 50 withdrawing from the placebo cohort so then
[1:09:24.640 --> 1:09:31.520]  you have 22,030 getting dose one out of which 46 caught COVID after dose one of
[1:09:31.520 --> 1:09:36.560]  the placebo you have about 110 of those people catching COVID then following that
[1:09:36.560 --> 1:09:40.440]  you have 271 people withdrawing themselves from the Pfizer cohort
[1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:47.800]  including two deaths of the people in the Pfizer cohort and you have 380 people
[1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:51.840]  withdrawing from the placebo cohort including two deaths so we're on even
[1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:55.800]  ground now two deaths from the vaccine cohort two deaths from the placebo
[1:09:55.800 --> 1:10:07.000]  cohort you're down to 21,759 for dose two versus 21,650 for the placebo
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:14.360]  dose two 85 of the Pfizer cohort caught COVID 924 caught COVID from the
[1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:20.320]  placebo group and these numbers would make you think that it works all right
[1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:24.080]  and these are some of the numbers that they used and yeah all of this study
[1:10:24.080 --> 1:10:27.880]  comes from med r ix or whatever it's called so these are I mean these are
[1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:33.040]  the official numbers but following that you had open label so now the
[1:10:33.040 --> 1:10:38.200]  participants are no longer it's no longer hidden from them and it's no longer
[1:10:38.200 --> 1:10:44.840]  hidden from the study takers whether they're a placebo or not so then you
[1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:50.040]  have a little over 20,000 open label Pfizer receivers a little over 20,000
[1:10:50.040 --> 1:10:57.840]  open label placebo receivers now following the opening up of these you
[1:10:57.840 --> 1:11:02.600]  had three more deaths in the Pfizer cohort no extra deaths in the placebo
[1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:07.480]  cohort and then you had a former placebo cohort who then chose to actually get
[1:11:07.480 --> 1:11:13.200]  the Pfizer shot you had a couple of those people doing it and during that you
[1:11:13.200 --> 1:11:16.800]  had two more deaths in the Pfizer cohort so at the end of the day the death
[1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:24.600]  summary is those who got the vaccine had 21 deaths and those who did not get the
[1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:32.800]  vaccine only had 15 deaths now with the with the vaccinated people you only had
[1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:36.160]  one death caused by COVID while you had two deaths caused by COVID in the
[1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:42.200]  placebo group you had one HIV infected person in the vaccinated group and one
[1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:48.720]  in the non-vaccinated group but you had four cardiac arrests in the vaccine
[1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:58.000]  group and only one cardiac arrest in the placebo group so at the end of the day
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:03.280]  apparently you were more likely to die if you received the vaccine than not and
[1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:07.480]  that's from the internal studies that were actually used to justify the release
[1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:11.120]  of this vaccine shows you just how dishonest they are we've got a couple
[1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:15.080]  other articles we'll get to on the other side including this from daily skeptic
[1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:19.360]  vaccinated have up to six times the infection rate of the unvaccinated
[1:12:19.360 --> 1:12:24.040]  according to New Zealand government data I believe the Supreme Court of New
[1:12:24.040 --> 1:12:29.800]  Zealand has now forced the Prime Minister to end the restrictions calling it a
[1:12:29.800 --> 1:12:33.880]  gross violation of human rights and we'll talk about the grid iron
[1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:37.680]  dinner where all of these politicians supposedly got COVID and I'll also show
[1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:42.560]  you a selection from this Peter McCollough speech about VAERS showing the
[1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:47.640]  true devastation being wrought across the pop across the world population by
[1:12:47.640 --> 1:12:51.400]  these COVID shots and their deadly side effects before you now let's go out to
[1:12:51.400 --> 1:12:56.520]  the phone calls we have Derek in FEMA region 10 that is Canada thanks calling
[1:12:56.520 --> 1:13:00.920]  in Derek you're on the air here so can you hear me I hear you thanks calling in
[1:13:00.920 --> 1:13:05.640]  great yeah so I'm actually I'm calling here from Canada but you know I'm near
[1:13:05.640 --> 1:13:09.520]  just just close to Washington State here Victoria versus Columbia Canada so I
[1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:16.040]  want to give you guys an update there there was a there's a reporter for
[1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:20.480]  Rebel News named Jeremy LaFredo and he did an interview with Dr. Robert Malone
[1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:26.280]  recently that was really good tying in COVID vaccine trucker convoys and the
[1:13:26.280 --> 1:13:31.560]  World Economic Forum and it's on their website there's you know they still have
[1:13:31.560 --> 1:13:38.360]  the website up convoyreports.com Rebel News but yeah he he did and Jeremy
[1:13:38.360 --> 1:13:43.440]  LaFredo he was the only one of the only Canadian independent journalists that
[1:13:43.440 --> 1:13:47.800]  was embedded in the US truckers convoy from day one when it started on the in
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:52.640]  San Francisco there or wherever and then all the way to Washington so I you know I
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:58.960]  think that's pretty cool yeah I mean you know but yeah I just want to just
[1:13:58.960 --> 1:14:03.360]  quickly run off some headlines here so we got RCMP admits to targeting 18
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:08.040]  individuals 39 vehicles with emergency powers act finance minister refuses to
[1:14:08.040 --> 1:14:11.160]  answer questions about what the government labeled suspicious convoy
[1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:17.760]  crowdfunding donations Ottawa take please take year-long extension on to
[1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:23.280]  return convoy of access to information requests right I mean this is it okay and
[1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:26.480]  then I don't know if you've heard but they arrested this famous member of
[1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:32.480]  Parliament he's he's loved by he's an old old older guy I mean you know he's
[1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:36.440]  he's an older guy Randy Hillier if you heard him I've heard the name but tell
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:41.120]  us what happened to him well he's you know been a long time you know well-known
[1:14:41.120 --> 1:14:46.800]  politician you know you know I remember my dad watching him and and like anyway
[1:14:46.800 --> 1:14:50.480]  they they arrested him like twice like two times they just made this big
[1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:53.920]  spectacle it's it's it's just ridiculous it's it's out of control man the
[1:14:53.920 --> 1:14:57.680]  political posturing here by our government and the people are totally
[1:14:57.680 --> 1:15:03.200]  you know it's it's like you know the people are I would say the there's
[1:15:03.200 --> 1:15:08.040]  there's a large majority now that's woken up here in Canada recently so it's a
[1:15:08.040 --> 1:15:13.520]  good thing I mean I'm happy about but on the other hand I just see them my
[1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:17.080]  government here in Canada just doubling down and it yeah they're they're beta
[1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:21.200]  testing yeah they're seeing how far they can push it and it's crazy it's it's
[1:15:21.200 --> 1:15:25.320]  crazy because because I'm you know I'm a Christian you know I try to stay
[1:15:25.320 --> 1:15:30.880]  positive and and all that and and like we are still having our rallies here but
[1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:34.600]  the truckers they're having a hard time I mean they're trying to they're playing
[1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:38.800]  games like they they were gonna have a big rally on the island here I mean the
[1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:42.520]  province of here's Columbia and so they they were but they they had to put it
[1:15:42.520 --> 1:15:46.360]  postponed it for a year sorry a week they postponed it for a week possibly two
[1:15:46.360 --> 1:15:51.080]  weeks they're doing they're doing everything they can to shut down any
[1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:56.280]  uprising against them and yeah they're beta testing how far they can go Canada's
[1:15:56.280 --> 1:16:03.600]  the experiment there is very little contemporary study in the world of the
[1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:09.280]  planet's ruling class not in communist China not in Mexico not in the United
[1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:15.040]  States not anywhere is there a real study of the planet's ruling class that's
[1:16:15.040 --> 1:16:19.800]  done by design the large central banks that basically control the planet will
[1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:24.680]  penalize and target any academics that look into say the Anglo-American
[1:16:24.680 --> 1:16:28.160]  establishment the sound of the Bilderberg group the trilateral Commission the
[1:16:28.160 --> 1:16:32.840]  United Nations the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers until

[1:19:59.360 --> 1:20:07.800]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[1:20:14.240 --> 1:20:21.640]  all right welcome back ladies and gentlemen we are living through what
[1:20:21.640 --> 1:20:24.960]  could very well be the greatest crime against humanity the world has ever
[1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:31.760]  seen with the COVID vaccine rollout I mean on top of the lockdowns on top of
[1:20:31.760 --> 1:20:38.320]  the masks which themselves have had in expressively devastating impacts on the
[1:20:38.320 --> 1:20:44.960]  world economy and people's mental health I mean to really compile all of the
[1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:50.920]  damage done in reaction to this virus that was created in a lab that was my
[1:20:50.920 --> 1:20:55.880]  opinion released on purpose strategically at exactly the right time for it to
[1:20:55.880 --> 1:21:01.960]  perfectly interfere with the 2020 election cycle and justify their criminal
[1:21:01.960 --> 1:21:12.000]  desire for mail-in ballots but it's like even if what would be worth it what
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:15.560]  would be worth if it was the plague if it was 50% of the people they got it
[1:21:15.560 --> 1:21:19.960]  died if it was Ebola or something maybe then you could potentially make the
[1:21:19.960 --> 1:21:25.360]  argument but this is the cold right this is a particularly vicious cold that's
[1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:29.800]  all that COVID is and we have just committed global suicide as a result of
[1:21:29.800 --> 1:21:35.760]  it it's unbelievable and again that's not even getting into the vaccine once
[1:21:35.760 --> 1:21:40.200]  you have the vaccine on top of it I mean this is just well as Dr. Peter McCullough
[1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:46.120]  puts it COVID dad COVID jab death count is worse than a war it's worse than a
[1:21:46.120 --> 1:21:51.440]  world war it's worse than potentially every war we've fought in a century
[1:21:51.440 --> 1:21:58.240]  combined the amount of deaths that are expected as a consequence of this stuff
[1:21:58.560 --> 1:22:03.720]  it's just impossible to say let's get back to this daily skeptic article
[1:22:03.720 --> 1:22:07.880]  vaccinated have up to six times the infection rate of the unvaccinated
[1:22:07.880 --> 1:22:13.760]  New Zealand government data shows it's really pretty unbelievable but this
[1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:18.640]  chart tells you more or less all all things you need to know you see a chart
[1:22:18.640 --> 1:22:25.560]  of COVID cases since late February 2022 per 100,000 population per day and
[1:22:25.560 --> 1:22:32.080]  you've got four colored lines the very bottom of which the green one is the
[1:22:32.080 --> 1:22:43.760]  unvaccinated as the least COVID infected are the unvaccinated and interestingly
[1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:48.680]  if you get one dose that's the yellow line here pretty pretty massive but if
[1:22:48.680 --> 1:22:55.800]  you get two doses that's the blue line here just huge huge spike and then
[1:22:55.800 --> 1:23:03.600]  boosted is down here towards the bottom but it's just wild it would be
[1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:07.600]  inexplicable if they hadn't changed the name of vaccines right they didn't change
[1:23:07.600 --> 1:23:12.400]  the meaning of the word vaccine this would be just baffling and shocking and
[1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:15.920]  confusing because vaccine used to mean that you would not get the virus that's
[1:23:15.920 --> 1:23:21.480]  what it used to mean actually tweeted out yesterday it's going minorly viral
[1:23:21.480 --> 1:23:26.200]  weirdly where I just said you know if your first reaction of getting a disease
[1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:30.320]  is thank God I'm vaccinated against this disease you're a mind-controlled slave
[1:23:30.320 --> 1:23:35.440]  like it makes no sense it just makes no sense at all oh thank God I'm vaccinated
[1:23:35.440 --> 1:23:39.480]  against this disease that I just got it makes no sense except that they change
[1:23:39.480 --> 1:23:45.200]  the meaning of vaccinated to mean you're protected against the most severe
[1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:49.880]  consequences which isn't even true obviously let's take a look at some of
[1:23:49.880 --> 1:23:53.360]  these numbers they say firstly the obvious thing is that during the most
[1:23:53.360 --> 1:23:57.560]  recent COVID wave there's been a much lower infection rate in the unvaccinated
[1:23:57.560 --> 1:24:01.760]  compared to those compared with those that have been given one two or three
[1:24:01.760 --> 1:24:05.600]  doses what's more this is not a small effect over the period shown approximately
[1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:09.360]  10% of the triple vaccinated in New Zealand were affected 14% of the
[1:24:09.360 --> 1:24:13.000]  single vaccinated were infected and astounding 18% of the double vaccinated
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:21.040]  were infected while only 3% of the unvaccinated appear to be infected the
[1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:25.400]  order of effect is also seen in UK for some time in the UK the highest case
[1:24:25.400 --> 1:24:30.600]  rates have been found in the triple vaccinated and you can see here they just
[1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:33.240]  went ahead and charted it out the infectious data from New Zealand allows
[1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:36.360]  to estimate the vaccines effectiveness for the COVID vaccines in the absence of
[1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:41.480]  natural immunity so for one dose your vaccine effectiveness is negative 430
[1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:46.400]  percent with two doses the effectiveness is negative 540 percent and with
[1:24:46.400 --> 1:24:54.160]  three doses the vaccine effectiveness is negative 310 percent this alone this
[1:24:54.160 --> 1:24:59.080]  alone is shocking for anybody that wasn't aware this was the case since the
[1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:03.640]  very beginning but I it's got to be shocking for most people out there so
[1:25:03.640 --> 1:25:09.440]  even if the vaccine was just saline solution it would it would be more
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:13.680]  effective than the vaccine we have now and that's not even starting to count the
[1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:21.120]  massive massive rise in heart attacks and young people cardiac arrest myocarditis
[1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:26.080]  and a number of other incredibly dangerous side effects let's go down to
[1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:29.880]  this video you can find it at info wars.com Dr. Peter McCullough the COVID
[1:25:29.880 --> 1:25:36.920]  covid jab death count is worse than war here it is I can tell you looking at
[1:25:36.920 --> 1:25:44.800]  this VAERS report with 12,000 Americans who have died voluntarily after taking
[1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:52.520]  an injection the COVID-19 vaccine is worse than a war it's worse than most
[1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:59.040]  wars now for VAERS vaccine reverse event reporting system 86% of the time the
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:03.040]  report is made by a doctor a nurse or healthcare professional who thinks the
[1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:09.360]  vaccine caused the problem 14% of the time it's by the patient themselves or
[1:26:09.360 --> 1:26:14.440]  someone else in their behalf the forms are filled out under the threat of
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:18.600]  imprisonment or federal fines if they're falsified so everything up on this red
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:25.120]  board is airtight the reports get a preliminary VAERS number and then the
[1:26:25.120 --> 1:26:29.160]  CDC verifies everything one of them everything in the red box report is
[1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:33.680]  verified so when I report a case of myocarditis or death the CDC calls
[1:26:33.680 --> 1:26:40.200]  me check I've done it so I know so these are real people who have lost their
[1:26:40.200 --> 1:26:46.040]  lives now the estimates are that this is underreported you can imagine so many
[1:26:46.040 --> 1:26:49.880]  people died nobody knows if they took the vaccine and unless you have the
[1:26:49.880 --> 1:26:53.800]  vaccine card and you enter the lot number correctly and a lot numbers by
[1:26:53.800 --> 1:26:58.280]  the way are handwritten on cards so if we enter in the raw lot number
[1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:02.400]  incorrectly or don't have the vaccine card there's no report so the estimates
[1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:06.760]  are this is underreported we know from other sources of data that this is
[1:27:06.760 --> 1:27:13.080]  underreported by a factor of five or potentially a factor of 20 these are
[1:27:13.080 --> 1:27:19.800]  very very large numbers and there are papers now many papers describing how
[1:27:19.800 --> 1:27:25.160]  the vaccine actually injures these organs this one by Almas and colleagues
[1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:30.800]  describe in the peer reviewed published literature this new set of diseases many
[1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:36.280]  of them cardiovascular this paper by Pantosacos and Seligman is particularly
[1:27:36.280 --> 1:27:42.120]  concerning they used us census data as well as vaccine administration data and
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:47.240]  looked at death from zero to 20 weeks and they concluded that the upper bound of
[1:27:47.240 --> 1:27:55.040]  a confidence interval for death could be as high as 187,000 Americans losing
[1:27:55.040 --> 1:28:00.800]  their life after vaccine 187,000 this is it that was just a very small portion of
[1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:04.800]  a very long and thorough talk given by dr. Peter McCullough you can find the
[1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:09.320]  full video now at info wars.com the truth is coming out whether they like it or

[1:33:04.600 --> 1:33:31.600]  Jones live from Austin Texas it's Alex Jones. Welcome back folks Harrison Smith
[1:33:31.600 --> 1:33:35.640]  sitting in for Alex Jones today on this live broadcast from the info wars
[1:33:35.640 --> 1:33:39.160]  headquarters we're gonna go to your phone calls momentarily still to come in
[1:33:39.160 --> 1:33:45.040]  today's program I want to show you a video from a trans non-binary teacher
[1:33:45.040 --> 1:33:49.920]  saying that three-year-olds should not be taught about sex what a what a
[1:33:49.920 --> 1:33:55.000]  concept just because your LGBT doesn't mean you want to indoctrinate children
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:34:02.600]  what what a what a bizarre concept that is it's just it's just anyway we'll show
[1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:05.800]  you that in just a little bit but I want to go out to your phone calls in this
[1:34:05.800 --> 1:34:10.120]  article but or in this segment but before I do I want to read this thread
[1:34:10.120 --> 1:34:16.080]  from Vinay Prasad on Twitter lessons from gridiron dinner so the gridiron
[1:34:16.080 --> 1:34:20.680]  dinner was the event that all of these politicians went to where they all got
[1:34:20.680 --> 1:34:24.720]  COVID I guess here's some lessons we can learn from that number one the vaccine
[1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:28.720]  passports do not work mandates and passports became ethically bankrupt
[1:34:28.720 --> 1:34:31.760]  when breakthrough cases became inevitable I would disagree with that they
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:37.160]  became ethically bankrupt before they were even acknowledged we knew this was
[1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:42.040]  coming and it was never right to do and yet it was justified by pretending like
[1:34:42.040 --> 1:34:45.680]  the vaccine actually worked and that you know tests could prevent people from
[1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:49.880]  spreading it I mean masks locked down literally none of it works so it was
[1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:53.880]  never moral it was never it was never ethical it was always bankrupt of these
[1:34:53.880 --> 1:34:58.400]  things but that's one lesson we can learn because they had vaccine passports
[1:34:58.400 --> 1:35:02.520]  they tested people before going to this event and it still was a super spreader
[1:35:02.520 --> 1:35:08.280]  event as it were number two Fauci and Walensky go to 700 unmasked dinners the
[1:35:08.280 --> 1:35:12.400]  700 people at this dinner unmasked but toddlers in New York City are victims of
[1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:18.800]  CDC's data-free toddler mask guidance WTF good point Vinay number three
[1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:23.080]  everyone will get COVID-19 even the rich and powerful boosting in perpetuity has
[1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:27.120]  a transient effect but needs better data to know if young people have further
[1:35:27.120 --> 1:35:31.280]  gains in severe disease reduction no it doesn't it's not just not happening
[1:35:31.280 --> 1:35:36.720]  halting infection halting infection is not a tenable goal yeah we know it's just
[1:35:36.720 --> 1:35:41.360]  like isn't it fun folks isn't it fun just watching everybody catch up to info
[1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:45.800]  wars two years ago it's like well maybe we shouldn't have locked everyone down
[1:35:45.800 --> 1:35:50.080]  maybe it's not feasible to say we're gonna stop we're gonna shut down the
[1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:53.960]  economy until the common cold is dealt with it's like yeah no this was never
[1:35:53.960 --> 1:35:58.360]  feasible this was another never ethical this was never moral this was always a
[1:35:58.360 --> 1:36:05.680]  power grab please stop like softening your claims I was like oh well we just
[1:36:05.680 --> 1:36:09.560]  need more information no we don't know it's all wrong this is all wrong it's all
[1:36:09.560 --> 1:36:15.480]  stupid it's all pointless and all has negative efficacy so just stop okay but
[1:36:15.480 --> 1:36:19.200]  going on he says hypocrisy is rampant some people who pushed for school closure
[1:36:19.200 --> 1:36:22.960]  lockdown interventions that harmed the poor are happy to party they should drop
[1:36:22.960 --> 1:36:25.800]  all remaining restrictions like airplane and toddler masking and vow not to
[1:36:25.800 --> 1:36:32.160]  reinstitute it without the data to back it up again nothing new this has been
[1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:36.680]  going on since the very first lockdowns and politicians being caught saying well
[1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:40.840]  it's important that my hair look good so these laws aren't for me and this is all
[1:36:40.840 --> 1:36:45.720]  baked in this is all on purpose the COVID laws were designed to be to apply
[1:36:45.720 --> 1:36:51.120]  only to people without political or corporate support the same time that the
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:54.480]  island of New Zealand was a prison you couldn't go in or out and unless you're
[1:36:54.480 --> 1:36:59.200]  the CEO of Google right they built it into the UK law saying you have to go
[1:36:59.200 --> 1:37:04.280]  through this quarantine two-week isolation period and they say unless
[1:37:04.280 --> 1:37:08.520]  you're a part of a big corporation then you can ignore this so it's only for
[1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:12.480]  plebeians only for us it's only for the underclass to have to do this everybody
[1:37:12.480 --> 1:37:15.600]  else can ignore it if you have a private plane you don't have to wear a mask on it
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:20.920]  obviously asymptomatic testing is a fool's errand he says living with other
[1:37:20.920 --> 1:37:26.920]  people means getting sick pretty normal unless you're you know just a healthy
[1:37:26.920 --> 1:37:30.960]  person doctors are maskless at conferences as we speak and Faucian
[1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:33.920]  Lewinsky went to a super spreader dinner all restrictions should be dropped it's
[1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:39.160]  over no one will accept any more hypocrisy he says there's hundreds of
[1:37:39.160 --> 1:37:42.320]  gridiron events in America daily we only know about this one in minutiae
[1:37:42.320 --> 1:37:45.920]  because it involves famous people the how could it have been done better
[1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:50.000]  columns miss the broader perspective of reality they're not missing anything I
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:54.320]  hate to say they are purposefully ignoring or concealing the reality to
[1:37:54.320 --> 1:38:01.520]  continue to push their tyrannical takeover measures and force us all into
[1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:06.520]  medically justified slavery that's all it is so I'm glad some people are
[1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:10.640]  starting to wake up sure could use your help two years ago but we're happy to
[1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:13.440]  have you on the team now welcome to info wars let's go back out to your calls
[1:38:13.440 --> 1:38:19.520]  we've got I want to go to Nathan you're talking about Bertrand to Russell because
[1:38:19.520 --> 1:38:24.080]  so much of this has to do with the manipulation of language and of
[1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:29.440]  manufacturing of consent for this stuff it's all completely arbitrary and
[1:38:29.440 --> 1:38:32.240]  baseless everything that they're pushing but they get everybody behind it
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:35.880]  through their control of the media as laid out by Bertrand Russell at the
[1:38:35.880 --> 1:38:38.520]  beginning of last century thanks for calling in Nathan you're on the air
[1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:42.880]  thanks so much Harrison always a pleasure hey you just shout out to the
[1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:46.360]  previous caller from Victoria hey I'm just up the road in the Komoks Valley
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:50.040]  much Canadians calling in today we love it yeah I have from Vancouver Island I
[1:38:50.040 --> 1:38:54.960]  know and shout out to Dennis from Kentucky have you tried the new
[1:38:54.960 --> 1:39:00.600]  mouthwash look Jordan Peterson compared souls and eats and Tolstoy to Shakespeare
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:06.120]  okay that's his words not mine right and Jay Dyer on Friday show that talked
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:11.400]  about specifically about Bertrand Russell and the quote diet injections and
[1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:16.840]  injunctions and let's break that down please diet that's poison food
[1:39:16.840 --> 1:39:25.440]  injections painted vaccines and injunctions that's globalist you EU
[1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:34.720]  policy world WHO policy it through diet injections and injunctions again this
[1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:40.920]  is Bertrand Russell's quote we want to quote make children believe snow is black
[1:39:40.920 --> 1:39:48.800]  right and quote okay so let's go back to souls and eats and now this is info
[1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:54.560]  wars is tomorrow to next week's news today souls and eats and work will be
[1:39:54.560 --> 1:40:00.440]  pulled from the shelves why because souls and eats and ripped Bertrand Russell a
[1:40:00.440 --> 1:40:09.120]  new one on page 59 of volume 2 gulag archipelago quote and is this another
[1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:15.320]  book you have not read sir Bertrand Russell referring to quote an island
[1:40:15.320 --> 1:40:22.760]  hell 1926 regarding the soul of Etsy Island okay and so the my prediction
[1:40:22.760 --> 1:40:28.320]  here tomorrow's news today is souls and eats and work it's gonna be pulled from
[1:40:28.320 --> 1:40:34.520]  the shelves because that's what communists do they destroy evidence you
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:37.320]  know this actually goes right and long with what I started the show with which
[1:40:37.320 --> 1:40:41.800]  was my piece about the Alamo because my argument in that piece is that they want
[1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:46.320]  to make the album you know they want to destroy the lessons of the Alamo because
[1:40:46.320 --> 1:40:49.360]  the Alamo it's not about race they're not they're not talking about race in it
[1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:53.360]  the Alamo and so many stories like it tell you how to resist tyranny and that's
[1:40:53.360 --> 1:40:57.320]  exactly what soul jenison does in the gulag archipelago he tells you in no
[1:40:57.320 --> 1:41:01.520]  uncertain terms here's how you resist this tyranny and he says you know we fell
[1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:06.240]  for we fell into the gulag system because we didn't love liberty enough he
[1:41:06.240 --> 1:41:09.960]  says we didn't love freedom enough and we allowed it to be taken from us piece by
[1:41:09.960 --> 1:41:13.680]  piece so yeah of course that they're not gonna they're not gonna give you the
[1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:17.960]  key to breaking the tyranny that they're trying to saddle on your shoulders
[1:41:17.960 --> 1:41:22.480]  right they're not they're not going to give you these stories in history that
[1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:25.920]  tells you when you're confronted with tyranny here's how you act here's how
[1:41:25.920 --> 1:41:30.240]  you confront it here's how you defeat it because the history is replete with these
[1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:36.960]  examples and it doesn't take overwhelming force it doesn't take nuclear bombs it
[1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:44.800]  takes small groups of people willing to die for freedom and centered and coalesced
[1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:49.560]  around a singular voice for freedom you can take down tyranny and doesn't matter
[1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:53.960]  how strong the tyranny is doesn't matter if it's a USSR or Santa Anna standing up
[1:41:53.960 --> 1:41:59.520]  against it is the only way that it goes away coming together and even unto death
[1:41:59.520 --> 1:42:03.000]  resisting it is the only way that tyranny breaks so I think you're exactly
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:06.040]  right they're gonna get rid of soldier Knitzen they might not just ban it
[1:42:06.040 --> 1:42:08.640]  outright they might do that if they have enough power if they're if they're cocky
[1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:12.080]  enough to do so but they're more likely to take the tack that they took with the
[1:42:12.080 --> 1:42:15.720]  Alamo which is to put out a ton of information saying oh actually soldier
[1:42:15.720 --> 1:42:21.040]  Knitzen's racist actually he's a racist so you know out of out of respect for
[1:42:21.040 --> 1:42:25.280]  care for racism we're gonna have to not have many more and they'll put out
[1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:29.780]  biographies talking about how soldier Knitzen was a reactionary propagandist
[1:42:29.780 --> 1:42:33.440]  they'll destroy his reputation they may give him the the info wars treatment
[1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:38.480]  right they may destroy his reputation first and then take the books out after
[1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:42.320]  but I think you're exactly right they're going to destroy all the things that
[1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:48.680]  make us aware of the way that you defeat tyranny Bertrand Russell may also be on
[1:42:48.680 --> 1:42:52.560]  that list how they may they may you know sensor the stuff that tells how they do
[1:42:52.560 --> 1:42:56.720]  it because that's the key to how to undo it
[1:42:56.720 --> 1:43:03.560]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three-part founder series at 1776
[1:43:03.560 --> 1:43:08.520]  coin dot com or info or store dot com and the second installment is the Tree of

[1:43:16.440 --> 1:43:20.800]  collectible I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other
[1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:26.320]  places for three times what we sold it we need to sell all ten thousand these
[1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:30.520]  very very quickly and I appreciate listeners are getting over half of them
[1:43:30.520 --> 1:43:33.880]  now I'd like to move them out very quickly I think they will sell out
[1:43:33.880 --> 1:43:38.640]  probably in five or six more days and without the last coin sale we would not
[1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:42.600]  be operating at the same capacity we've had to lay off a lot of people and had
[1:43:42.600 --> 1:43:46.120]  some big problems so as a limited edition collectible tied our political
[1:43:46.120 --> 1:43:49.040]  movement of liberty and freedom and it's needed for our infrastructure and

[1:47:11.240 --> 1:47:15.760]  welcome back ladies gentlemen this is the final segment of the alex jones show
[1:47:15.760 --> 1:47:19.200]  and there's still so much talk about so let's let's let's pack it all in here
[1:47:19.200 --> 1:47:25.080]  shall we first of all let me start with a pretty interesting comment by martyr
[1:47:25.080 --> 1:47:30.200]  made on twitter today is palm sunday and martyr made says this says when jesus
[1:47:30.200 --> 1:47:34.600]  entered Jerusalem he was welcomed with crowds waving palm fronds but where
[1:47:34.600 --> 1:47:37.720]  were these adoring crowds five days later when he was crucified were they
[1:47:37.720 --> 1:47:41.720]  hiding in fear no the crowd on palm sunday was the same crowd bang for his
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:45.840]  blood five days later at the urging of the priests the fickleness of the crowd
[1:47:45.840 --> 1:47:49.880]  its vulnerability to mimetic contagion is reflected in the story of peter's
[1:47:49.880 --> 1:47:53.400]  three denials for of christ for even peter the rock ready to fight with
[1:47:53.400 --> 1:47:57.760]  swords protect jesus cannot withstand the mimetic pressure of his peers and it's
[1:47:57.760 --> 1:48:02.280]  pretty brilliant pretty terrifying also if you think about it then of course from
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:07.480]  the bible jesus knows what is in man says this is a john two twenty three now
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:12.000]  when he was in jerusalem at the Passover feast many believed his in his name when
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:16.400]  they saw the signs that he was doing but jesus on his part did not entrust himself
[1:48:16.400 --> 1:48:20.040]  to them because he knew all people and needed no one to bear witness about man
[1:48:20.040 --> 1:48:26.960]  for he himself knew what was in man and it is uh it's a bummer isn't it how
[1:48:26.960 --> 1:48:33.120]  easily people can be swayed by pressure from outside but one thing you need to
[1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:37.920]  know is that will never be a factor for us here at info wars we have the whole
[1:48:37.920 --> 1:48:42.680]  world against us it seems at times but we know you have our back and that alone
[1:48:42.680 --> 1:48:47.400]  makes this job easy to be honest with you to see the number of people I see out

[1:51:11.280 --> 1:51:16.000]  government and it didn't get that way overnight Joe Biden is not a standout
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:20.520]  corrupt individual they all are like this you think Nancy Pelosi Sun's laptop
[1:51:20.520 --> 1:51:25.000]  doesn't have just as much incriminating information of course it does but anyway
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:28.120]  tell us what you think go to info wars.com right now take advantage of or

[1:51:33.280 --> 1:51:38.320]  tons of amazing videos there right now on the on the scroller of course the
[1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:42.200]  Peter McCollough speech that showed you earlier I'm gonna go out to phone calls
[1:51:42.200 --> 1:51:44.720]  in just a second but first I do want to show you one of the videos that you can
[1:51:44.720 --> 1:51:50.720]  find at info wars.com and that is a video of a trans non-binary teacher talking
[1:51:50.720 --> 1:51:56.760]  about teaching at three-year-olds about sex now from that setup you may think it
[1:51:56.760 --> 1:52:02.600]  goes one way take a look at the video so you think after this let's watch I'm a
[1:52:02.600 --> 1:52:08.320]  queer teacher and I 1000% do not support this bill and yes I do know what's in it
[1:52:08.320 --> 1:52:13.480]  well in itself is just another way to stigmatize the LGBTQ plus community kids
[1:52:13.480 --> 1:52:16.960]  as young as three and four are actually aware of their gender identity even if
[1:52:16.960 --> 1:52:20.400]  they don't have the language for it so very aware of who they like and who they
[1:52:20.400 --> 1:52:24.560]  don't like heterosexuality is pushing our kids on a daily basis at a very young
[1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:29.160]  age media through books the first Disney movie that you saw say that pre-k
[1:52:29.160 --> 1:52:33.080]  through third grade are not ready for such topics is actually internalized
[1:52:33.080 --> 1:52:37.280]  homophobia and transphobia very much ready for these topics and are way more
[1:52:37.280 --> 1:52:40.800]  accepting than adults when it comes to discussing these topics and talk about
[1:52:40.800 --> 1:52:45.880]  gender gender assumptions pronouns all the things and it is child development
[1:52:45.880 --> 1:52:50.360]  appropriate and age appropriate literally created as just another means to
[1:52:50.360 --> 1:52:57.400]  other queer people basically say that us existing is not normal but I'm very
[1:52:57.400 --> 1:53:02.000]  confused I'm not as confused as that person but I mean that person's
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:07.920]  confusion I think is rubbed off on me I 1000% do not support this bill okay she
[1:53:07.920 --> 1:53:12.000]  doesn't support it all right he she whatever doesn't support it I was
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:19.720]  confused should not be taught about sex she's like they don't need to be taught
[1:53:19.720 --> 1:53:22.680]  about sex because they already know it all because we're already getting to
[1:53:22.680 --> 1:53:32.280]  them God I don't I just feel sorry I feel sorry for for normal gay people
[1:53:32.280 --> 1:53:37.560]  honestly feel sorry for normal trans people that are just like because the
[1:53:37.560 --> 1:53:39.960]  conversation is just pretty simple it's like I don't think you should be
[1:53:39.960 --> 1:53:45.400]  teaching my little baby child about sex in school that's weird there's like oh
[1:53:45.400 --> 1:53:49.200]  you hate gay people then you should imagine a person like whoa don't bring me
[1:53:49.200 --> 1:53:54.640]  into this I'm not indoctrinating kids that's creepy and weird but you know
[1:53:54.640 --> 1:53:59.560]  this is this is the usefulness of identity politics I guess they can just
[1:53:59.560 --> 1:54:05.400]  convince you that to be support to be in support of LGBTQ material means that
[1:54:05.400 --> 1:54:09.440]  you have to support indoctrinating children into your belief system at a
[1:54:09.440 --> 1:54:15.400]  very young age in public schools not the case folks not the case no that's that's
[1:54:15.400 --> 1:54:19.800]  not true everybody should be against this unless you're a groomer unless you're a
[1:54:19.800 --> 1:54:23.520]  pedophile right that's why this word groomer so powerful and that's why
[1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:26.840]  they're trying to prevent people from saying it on Twitter now with that let's
[1:54:26.840 --> 1:54:32.880]  go out to a few more phone calls here let's go to Dennis in Kentucky thanks

[1:55:19.280 --> 1:55:23.000]  down the road but thank you so much Dennis but you called you called in
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:29.240]  about Barack Obama and I think your idea I've heard a lot I've heard a lot of
[1:55:29.240 --> 1:55:33.360]  people and I think a lot of people agree with with what you think so tell us
[1:55:33.360 --> 1:55:38.760]  what you think that the plan is with build back better seriously I mean and
[1:55:38.760 --> 1:55:45.040]  and in 2000 in 2012 November 7th 2012 Kamal Darvis
[1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:50.600]  administrator of the United Nations Development Program wrote a piece in
[1:55:50.600 --> 1:55:56.120]  the world economic forum by Barack Obama's second turn see he showed and
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:56:04.040]  detailed how Barack Obama had to either kill off American people or buy back the
[1:56:04.040 --> 1:56:11.440]  public debt so what it is is that since he had already destroyed a lot of what
[1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:18.800]  he did what you called a build back better and actuality was bring back
[1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:24.960]  Barack hmm all the policies you're seeing right now you are what witnessing
[1:56:24.960 --> 1:56:33.080]  Barack Obama's third term as president right that's all this is I mean who killed
[1:56:33.080 --> 1:56:36.840]  Jeffrey Epstein I mean I've got a wife that's a transgender she can go in there
[1:56:36.840 --> 1:56:41.880]  and change and kill this dude and come on out oh you might you might have to get
[1:56:41.880 --> 1:56:46.160]  you might get sentenced to community service for like 15 hours or whatever
[1:56:46.160 --> 1:56:50.120]  their their jail guards were we're sentenced to but you know I've heard that a
[1:56:50.120 --> 1:56:53.680]  lot and I think there's something to that I mean I think the idea that Obama
[1:56:53.680 --> 1:56:58.000]  is pulling strings behind the scenes is pretty undeniable at this point seeing
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:01.520]  the way he was received at the White House as people ignored it Joe Biden
[1:57:01.520 --> 1:57:07.800]  seeing just that things happens or without explanation who's really making
[1:57:07.800 --> 1:57:11.560]  decisions here hearing Obama when he was still president saying well I'd like to
[1:57:11.560 --> 1:57:14.320]  have a third term as long as I could just pull the strings from the shadows and
[1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:18.360]  didn't have to be actually involved like he basically admitted it himself but
[1:57:18.360 --> 1:57:21.800]  also there's a there's a lot of people behind the scenes that think that some
[1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:26.600]  of the machinations going on are actually attempting to legitimately put
[1:57:26.600 --> 1:57:31.360]  Barack Obama back into the president's seat and set him up for a third term if
[1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:36.760]  not you know permanent presidency Allah jeez and paying so yeah keep an eye on
[1:57:36.760 --> 1:57:39.840]  Obama he hasn't gone anywhere and he's actually gotten more powerful since he
[1:57:39.840 --> 1:57:42.360]  left office all right folks that's gonna do it for us it's been the Alex John
[1:57:42.360 --> 1:57:46.720]  Sean Harrison Smith tune in tomorrow morning to American Journal

[1:58:46.760 --> 1:58:51.040]  com the average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware
[1:58:51.040 --> 1:58:56.560]  there's a war between free individuals and nation states on one side and the
[1:58:56.560 --> 1:59:00.480]  globalist on the other who are literally trying to create a post human
[1:59:00.480 --> 1:59:04.280]  world from the United States to Brazil and of course triggered by the bricks in
[1:59:04.280 --> 1:59:08.400]  the UK nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world
[1:59:08.400 --> 1:59:12.560]  government that's why they launched their great recess and their program after
[1:59:12.560 --> 1:59:18.680]  collapsing us of build back better this is nothing more than a top-down
[1:59:18.680 --> 1:59:23.400]  vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our
[1:59:23.400 --> 1:59:27.840]  guns because we wouldn't bow because the left which is the ideology of this
[1:59:27.840 --> 1:59:33.440]  world government system could win they released a biological weapon on us now
[1:59:33.440 --> 1:59:38.240]  we know two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago it's that simple
[1:59:38.240 --> 1:59:42.200]  they can't be because of our free speech in our guns so the global corporate
[1:59:42.200 --> 1:59:50.720]  combined release of a 19 and you know the rest of history expose this bear if
[1:59:50.720 --> 2:00:14.480]  you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
