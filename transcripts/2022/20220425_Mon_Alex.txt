[00:00.000 --> 00:28.320]  Something hit me last night and this morning while I was reading all the news and looking
[00:28.320 --> 00:33.480]  at the research and it's something we really talked about quite a bit here on air in the
[00:33.480 --> 00:44.120]  past but we're now here and I really think I should take today out to really thank you
[00:44.120 --> 00:50.960]  all and to tell you that I really appreciate you because we could be off the air at any
[00:50.960 --> 00:52.680]  moment.
[00:52.680 --> 00:57.000]  You could be plunged into a massive power outage that will be the beginning of martial
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.520]  law and we will be in the next phase of the new world order, the purpose will collapse
[01:03.520 --> 01:11.280]  of civilization and massive at least 90% depopulation in the next eight years.
[01:11.280 --> 01:16.680]  They're actually doing it, it's actually happening and just to chronicle all the attacks they're
[01:16.680 --> 01:20.360]  running right now would take the four hour show, we're going to hit a lot of them but
[01:20.360 --> 01:25.680]  as I look at all this incredibly important news, that is the most important and we have
[01:25.680 --> 01:31.440]  all the pieces, I know exactly what's going to happen, the only question is what is the
[01:31.440 --> 01:32.440]  timetable?
[01:32.440 --> 01:41.840]  I think you know what's happening as well but there's that great song with Elvis where
[01:41.840 --> 01:50.800]  he talks about baby have I ever told you how much I really loved you and he goes on
[01:50.800 --> 01:56.120]  to say that you were always on my mind, you were always on my mind and I've told the
[01:56.120 --> 01:59.160]  listeners how much I love you and appreciate you and the great historic battle we've been
[01:59.160 --> 02:04.520]  through, we tried to stop them initiating this final phase and we'd have a good chance
[02:04.520 --> 02:10.320]  going into this dark night to be able to beat them in the long run but I really need to
[02:10.320 --> 02:15.920]  just, I'll still continue on as long as possible, it might be a month, it might be two years
[02:15.920 --> 02:21.720]  but you need to get ready and you need to get your family ready and I've really been
[02:21.720 --> 02:27.960]  holding off telling you all this but I just, I think you already know but everything you
[02:27.960 --> 02:32.720]  see, everything standing, everything that's been here is going to be gone, they really
[02:32.720 --> 02:38.400]  intend to kill 90% of us and when it dawns on the left and the quizlings that have gone
[02:38.400 --> 02:42.400]  along with it, it'll be too late for them and too late for us so just get right with
[02:42.400 --> 02:51.240]  God, I'm trying to lay all this out today but there's no doubt now and I really care
[02:51.240 --> 02:56.480]  about this crew and I care about all of you and I care about my family and I just have
[02:56.480 --> 03:05.640]  a really sad feeling that we didn't stop this but we did the best job we could.
[03:05.640 --> 03:11.480]  They are dismantling every facet of civilization, the third world is completely collapsed, hundreds
[03:11.480 --> 03:16.640]  of millions are on their way now to Europe and the United States and North America, Mexico
[03:16.640 --> 03:23.120]  will completely collapse, we will collapse just like the blue cities and the power grid
[03:23.120 --> 03:33.040]  will start failing and the public will beg for stability and that will cement the massive
[03:33.040 --> 03:37.560]  tyranny you already see happening in China, if you ask why China has 400 million people
[03:37.560 --> 03:41.960]  on lockdown, it was just 30 million, for 35 million a month ago, I wonder why they're
[03:41.960 --> 03:46.600]  under such bizarre martial law, they're getting ready ahead of time for what's going to be
[03:46.600 --> 03:54.800]  happening here and they're definitely coordinating with the highest level of the globalist so
[03:54.800 --> 03:59.400]  I just need to take this opportunity today to tell you what's coming and also I really
[03:59.400 --> 04:04.960]  just feel like talking about how great it's been to know all of you and just in case we're
[04:04.960 --> 04:09.840]  off the air next week or next month because it's that close, all the stops have been pulled
[04:09.840 --> 04:16.960]  out and we have a puppet president that takes direction on television from the Easter Bunny
[04:16.960 --> 04:25.600]  and that's not a joke, that's very serious and the sheep like public when everything
[04:25.600 --> 04:30.600]  is taken from them will turn into complete monsters and if they're told hey go along
[04:30.600 --> 04:38.080]  with putting 100 million Americans in camps they'll do it and so my God what have we done,
[04:38.080 --> 04:42.360]  what have we become, I mean all over the country they're trying to pass laws to kill babies
[04:42.360 --> 04:49.360]  after they're born, I mean we're run by evil, we're the bad guys, we ride back ladies and
[04:49.360 --> 04:56.360]  gentlemen stay with us, infowars.com, chronicling the apocalypse, stay with us.
[04:56.360 --> 05:05.800]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand InfoWars, I've been on the air a couple
[05:05.800 --> 05:10.800]  of years but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show and I wanted
[05:10.800 --> 05:15.000]  to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge the globalist
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.160]  and it was a t-shirt, I designed the first one, mass murderers agree gun control works
[05:20.160 --> 05:24.600]  that helped us finance hiring the first few members of my crew, that's our oldest design
[05:24.600 --> 05:29.600]  and we're still selling, we have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited
[05:29.600 --> 05:34.920]  editions because whatever shop we've got in that's it, we're selling everything out to
[05:34.920 --> 05:39.080]  find the operation to get rid of inventory, we'll still have some t-shirts in the future,
[05:39.080 --> 05:42.960]  they'll just be limited editions and short runs so if you want to get any of these historic
[05:42.960 --> 05:48.160]  shirts this is your last chance, I almost forgot, we're selling them all at cost at
[05:48.160 --> 05:54.920]  infowarsstore.com, every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt,
[05:54.920 --> 06:17.040]  regular shirts, designer shirts, they're all selling at cost, infowarsstore.com.
[06:17.040 --> 06:25.160]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from the infowars.com
[06:25.160 --> 06:28.760]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:28.760 --> 06:38.680]  Alright, thank you for joining us on this live Monday, April 25th Worldwide broadcast,
[06:38.680 --> 06:44.600]  the only way to stop and even mitigate what we're entering is for people to really pull
[06:44.600 --> 06:50.400]  back to a 35,000 foot view and understand where we are and what's happening.
[06:50.400 --> 06:55.600]  It's a live emergency broadcast, live Monday emergency broadcast, an international cult
[06:55.600 --> 07:02.240]  of transhumanist, environmentalist, terrorist, or sabotaging civilization, tune in and learn
[07:02.240 --> 07:13.200]  how to stop them, infowars has confirmed that a multinational authoritarian cult is actively
[07:13.200 --> 07:18.200]  attacking every facet of the planet's supply chain.
[07:18.200 --> 07:23.320]  The Debo script is the mouthpiece of this psychotic multinational corporate backed post-humanist
[07:23.320 --> 07:24.320]  revolution.
[07:24.320 --> 07:32.000]  I think you now realize that when I would read out of Club of Rome and UN documents and
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.680]  Operation Walk Step from the Rockefeller Foundation and British Ministry of Defense
[07:36.680 --> 07:41.640]  reports where they predicted because they were laying all this out, this would be unfolding
[07:41.640 --> 07:50.880]  by the year 2020 and now we're two plus years into it that I wasn't making it up and I wasn't
[07:50.880 --> 07:54.360]  exaggerating that they weren't playing games.
[07:54.360 --> 08:00.480]  So there's a couple things we need to get out of the way here.
[08:00.480 --> 08:09.680]  The collapse that has been initiated is now irreversible.
[08:09.680 --> 08:16.560]  The word is irreversible, there's no putting the genie back in the bottle.
[08:16.560 --> 08:21.960]  Now it could be 10 or 20 times worse if they get what they're actually looking for and
[08:21.960 --> 08:29.960]  we're talking 6 billion plus dead by 2030, that's the official plan and they don't have
[08:29.960 --> 08:35.320]  Noah Harari and Klaus Schwab and the Wall Street Journal of New York Times saying looking
[08:35.320 --> 08:40.960]  forward to the end of humanity, they don't have people setting themselves in fire in
[08:40.960 --> 08:47.440]  front of the Supreme Court building, calling for an end to fossil fuels, of course they
[08:47.440 --> 08:53.320]  had to use fossil fuels to do it, isn't there irony to that?
[08:53.320 --> 09:01.440]  They're not doing all of this to play games.
[09:01.440 --> 09:07.200]  They decided that the public is dumb and lazy and weak and aimless and the decision has
[09:07.200 --> 09:14.600]  been made to kill you and me and my family and your family.
[09:14.600 --> 09:21.520]  And this issue is the only political, economic, cultural issue and of course it's spiritual
[09:21.520 --> 09:22.520]  in nature.
[09:22.520 --> 09:25.760]  It's a battle between good versus evil.
[09:25.760 --> 09:34.600]  But we're already deep into the collapse, we're already deep into the complete breaking
[09:34.600 --> 09:41.600]  of the social contract and I told you two plus years ago they would start environmental
[09:41.600 --> 09:47.200]  lockdowns once you were trained to live under the viral lockdown and now India and Italy
[09:47.200 --> 09:54.440]  have announced lockdowns rationing electricity only certain times of day to quote, save the
[09:54.440 --> 10:00.680]  earth and because quote the resources have been cut off from COVID which wasn't COVID
[10:00.680 --> 10:06.040]  but was the globalist using that as the pretext to destroy the global infrastructure.
[10:06.040 --> 10:13.040]  The globalist were a corporate system that took control of the international order and
[10:13.040 --> 10:18.280]  of the global order and of the idea of community of man and in humanity working together to
[10:18.280 --> 10:23.560]  put their grid into everything so that they could take the grids down.
[10:23.560 --> 10:34.880]  And now they're all over every media outlet you can imagine saying that the earth's carrying
[10:34.880 --> 10:38.680]  capacity has been reached and that billions are going to starve to death in the next few
[10:38.680 --> 10:44.560]  years and that you're going to live in a highly surveilled ration system where your smartphone
[10:44.560 --> 10:49.160]  tells you where you can go, what you can do and what you're allowed to buy and sell.
[10:49.160 --> 10:54.320]  And as the resources dwindle a lot of people will get on board the authoritarianism saying
[10:54.320 --> 10:59.520]  just do what they say and they'll stabilize the planet but of course the more you submit
[10:59.520 --> 11:04.080]  the worse it's going to get and that's why you see martial law drills in Canada and
[11:04.080 --> 11:09.040]  in blue cities in the U.S. and in China and all over Europe and everywhere this is the
[11:09.040 --> 11:14.520]  globally directed beta test that has now ended.
[11:14.520 --> 11:25.120]  The last 26 months, hell's longer than that, the last 28 months has been the beta tests
[11:25.120 --> 11:29.840]  for what we've now entered.
[11:29.840 --> 11:32.240]  Censorship is just the beginning so they can carry this out.
[11:32.240 --> 11:38.060]  Then there is the debanking, there is the persecution and there is the arrest and enslavement and
[11:38.060 --> 11:44.240]  execution of anyone opposing this planetary takeover.
[11:44.240 --> 11:50.120]  It should be very easy to defeat if we're able to model it, break it down, chronicle
[11:50.120 --> 11:56.400]  it and then get leaders who are compartmentalized to wake up, it could have been stopped but
[11:56.400 --> 12:03.600]  now the collapse is unfolding and so now it's even more desperate that we warn everybody
[12:03.600 --> 12:07.880]  so they understand that those initiating the collapse and admitting they're doing it and
[12:07.880 --> 12:14.360]  they're white papers are now the ones that are going to preside over the crisis and poses
[12:14.360 --> 12:19.440]  the savior and just put out the cover story to the dumb down public, to the very simplistic
[12:19.440 --> 12:24.080]  public, to the one dimensional public, oh there's deadly viruses because of global warming,
[12:24.080 --> 12:28.440]  oh there's collapse of the food chain because of global warming, oh we've got to do all
[12:28.440 --> 12:35.000]  this because of you're bad, humans are bad and then they have the organized, collapsed
[12:35.000 --> 12:42.640]  population and total transhumanist takeover of whoever's left at the end of that beyond
[12:42.640 --> 12:48.800]  this topic system that they have initiated and that's why they write the articles all
[12:48.800 --> 12:52.800]  over the control corporate press about looking forward to the end of humanity in the Wall
[12:52.800 --> 12:57.240]  Street Journal, NBC News, The Times of London, that's why they have articles everywhere saying
[12:57.240 --> 13:02.520]  we need dictatorship, we need authoritarianism, we're going to sexualize your children, this
[13:02.520 --> 13:08.360]  is a coming out of evil, this is hundreds of years of preparation and waiting and training
[13:08.360 --> 13:13.520]  and building their networks while they were rich and powerful presiding over humanity
[13:13.520 --> 13:19.200]  and now that we're entering the genesis of our next level, super technology, life extension,
[13:19.200 --> 13:23.560]  secrets of the universe, they want to dumb everybody down further, kill everybody so
[13:23.560 --> 13:28.560]  that the general public does not have access to this because they know time and time again
[13:28.560 --> 13:35.120]  out of the mass of the public, which on average is simple and dumb down, super geniuses come
[13:35.120 --> 13:40.240]  out of those groups that innovate and always overthrow the previous elites, then they become
[13:40.240 --> 13:42.960]  decadent generationally and the cycle continues.
[13:42.960 --> 13:49.960]  The globalists call this, and Obama talks about it, the end of history where there's
[13:49.960 --> 13:56.640]  a corporate total control over biological reproduction, over your mind surveilling everything
[13:56.640 --> 14:04.640]  you do so that the human system as we know it is ended because the Carnegie Endowment
[14:04.640 --> 14:09.280]  that runs the CIA today at the end of World War I in the League of Nations was given
[14:09.280 --> 14:16.960]  the charter to end war and the answer was end men and women, end the family, end all of
[14:16.960 --> 14:23.840]  human competition and create a corporate, medical, biomedical tyranny over the public
[14:23.840 --> 14:29.080]  where humans are produced that are even allowed to live that are not purely human but are
[14:29.080 --> 14:34.080]  chimeric species, corporately owned, and you see that of course in Brave New World published
[14:34.080 --> 14:41.520]  in 1931, the brother of Huxley, Julian Huxley, Aldous Huxley's brother goes on to create
[14:41.520 --> 14:47.120]  the UN, run the UN for two decades, create the transhumanist movement, launch the Tavistock
[14:47.120 --> 14:56.040]  Institute, the transgender system, all of it, and this is it.
[14:56.040 --> 15:01.600]  But to do that, they've got to completely cut you off and have giant masses of millions
[15:01.600 --> 15:05.920]  of people that are starving to death, who they can organize to take over your farms,
[15:05.920 --> 15:08.680]  your ranches, your factories, your business.
[15:08.680 --> 15:14.000]  Think about how they take over in a communist country, what they did in Venezuela.
[15:14.000 --> 15:21.480]  And now what they're about to do here, and you realize the full horror, the horror of
[15:21.480 --> 15:23.760]  what we've entered into.
[15:23.760 --> 15:27.720]  So I want to describe what this future is going to look like and I want to get into the current
[15:27.720 --> 15:32.000]  collapse mechanisms that are taking place and then the different pieces of how they're
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.440]  trying to outlaw dissent and silence any opposition ahead of this takeover.
[15:38.440 --> 15:45.200]  If we expose the globalist agenda and the WEF's agenda, then they're not going to get
[15:45.200 --> 15:51.000]  away with their final goal of using this collapse to totally depopulate and enslave us forever.
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.120]  It'll be their waterloo and a new awakening and renaissance.
[15:55.120 --> 16:19.520]  Let's fight this.
[16:19.520 --> 16:25.080]  That is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us 15, 20, 25 dollars to produce.
[16:25.080 --> 16:29.040]  We used to sell for 40, we're selling them for 15, selling them for 20, whatever the
[16:29.040 --> 16:30.040]  shirt costs us.
[16:30.040 --> 16:33.960]  If a shirt costs five dollars, we're selling it for five dollars for us to actually produce.
[16:33.960 --> 16:36.080]  If it costs ten dollars, we're selling it for ten dollars.
[16:36.080 --> 16:39.640]  And we've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves and we've got short sleeves.
[16:39.640 --> 16:44.320]  We've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all and they're limited edition because
[16:44.320 --> 16:46.440]  we're never going to make any of these designs.
[16:46.440 --> 16:51.320]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited, limited edition
[16:51.320 --> 16:52.320]  of the future.
[16:52.320 --> 16:57.040]  We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air plus it spreads the word infowarstore.com
[16:57.040 --> 16:59.920]  to your historic apparel now infowarstore.com.
[16:59.920 --> 17:04.480]  You know, it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true that M4 Wars
[17:04.480 --> 17:12.560]  is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist
[17:12.560 --> 17:17.240]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[17:17.240 --> 17:24.080]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever
[17:24.080 --> 17:25.080]  done.

[20:31.040 --> 20:53.720]  We have to celebrate humanity's awakening.
[20:53.720 --> 20:56.040]  We have to understand that this is a globalist attack.
[20:56.040 --> 21:03.680]  And if we know that, we can and will defeat them.
[21:03.680 --> 21:04.680]  What do you think of Alex Jones?
[21:04.680 --> 21:05.680]  I loved him to death.
[21:05.680 --> 21:08.560]  I still talk to him to this day, I think that he's great.
[21:08.560 --> 21:15.440]  And I think that many more people should have been vocal when he was initially banned because
[21:15.440 --> 21:16.440]  I was actually there.
[21:16.440 --> 21:21.760]  I was on a fishing trip that day and I was in Labrador and I've regretted it ever since
[21:21.760 --> 21:22.960]  that I didn't come out of the box.
[21:22.960 --> 21:23.960]  I wasn't there.
[21:23.960 --> 21:26.480]  I was off the air, but I completely agree.
[21:26.480 --> 21:30.920]  It was not even about Alex Jones, it's about you can't censor people, period.
[21:30.920 --> 21:31.920]  Exactly.
[21:31.920 --> 21:35.120]  And Tucker, I remember the exact day when he got censored, I woke up and I looked on
[21:35.120 --> 21:39.880]  my phone and it said, Alex Jones banned from YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.
[21:39.880 --> 21:40.880]  He was banned everywhere.
[21:40.880 --> 21:44.680]  It was a mass banning, mass censorship effort to silence him.
[21:44.680 --> 21:50.800]  And again, I really didn't have an introduction into politics, but I had learned a lot of
[21:50.800 --> 21:55.160]  things from Alex Jones up front and everything that he was telling me was not false.
[21:55.160 --> 21:58.720]  The people who condemn him and say that he's a crazy conspiracy theorist do not listen
[21:58.720 --> 22:01.800]  to his show every single day because I worked for him for two and a half years.
[22:01.800 --> 22:04.960]  I didn't know the three branches of government when I started.
[22:04.960 --> 22:09.440]  Now I can tell you international policy and what's going on all over the world right now
[22:09.440 --> 22:13.640]  because I have listened to Alex and he's talked about, you know, the government corruption
[22:13.640 --> 22:18.040]  historically that we've been through all of the different operations such as operation
[22:18.040 --> 22:21.640]  and mockingbird operation, paperclip, a lot of these things, the Tuskegee experiment,
[22:21.640 --> 22:25.720]  which is why, you know, the black community is so apprehensive for vaccinations in the
[22:25.720 --> 22:26.720]  modern day.
[22:26.720 --> 22:29.840]  He talks about a lot of these things and our government doesn't like that.
[22:29.840 --> 22:31.560]  Our government doesn't like being exposed.
[22:31.560 --> 22:34.440]  They don't like people who are willing to tell the truth and people who are willing
[22:34.440 --> 22:36.280]  to push back against the narrative.
[22:36.280 --> 22:40.400]  Look at the fact that the DHS just updated their bulletin to say, hey, if you're spreading
[22:40.400 --> 22:44.880]  distrust in the government, that could be considered terrorism.
[22:44.880 --> 22:46.280]  I don't think so.
[22:46.280 --> 22:51.080]  I couldn't, of course, agree with you more, but I'm fascinated by the hate for Alex Jones.
[22:51.080 --> 22:53.200]  I'm not a daily Alex Jones viewer.
[22:53.200 --> 22:58.120]  I don't view anything regularly, actually, but I think Alex Jones seems really talented.
[22:58.120 --> 22:59.120]  He's smart.
[22:59.120 --> 23:00.520]  He's funny as hell.
[23:00.520 --> 23:01.520]  He's truly funny.
[23:01.520 --> 23:04.520]  He's a lot more talented than I am in a lot of ways.
[23:04.520 --> 23:06.680]  That's my takeaway from Alex Jones.
[23:06.680 --> 23:08.000]  But why is he such a threat?
[23:08.000 --> 23:09.560]  Like, why would you hate Alex Jones?
[23:09.560 --> 23:11.080]  I've never understood that.
[23:11.080 --> 23:12.080]  Because he's telling the truth, Tucker.
[23:12.080 --> 23:16.760]  And again, I know Alex personally and I've met a lot of people in this industry.
[23:16.760 --> 23:20.400]  And one of my biggest takeaways is that there are a lot of people, especially in conservative
[23:20.400 --> 23:22.520]  media, that are in this for money and fame.
[23:22.520 --> 23:26.000]  They don't actually care about this country and they don't actually care about America.
[23:26.000 --> 23:27.480]  They're scared about being censored.
[23:27.480 --> 23:30.520]  They're scared about, you know, hurting the wrong people's feelings, not getting the
[23:30.520 --> 23:31.520]  proper endorsement.
[23:31.520 --> 23:32.880]  Alex doesn't care about any of that.
[23:32.880 --> 23:34.080]  Alex cares about the truth.
[23:34.080 --> 23:35.160]  He has since day one.
[23:35.160 --> 23:37.520]  He has made mistakes for sure, but he comes out.
[23:37.520 --> 23:38.520]  He apologizes for it.
[23:38.520 --> 23:43.040]  He corrects the record, which is something that many people in our media refuse to do.
[23:43.040 --> 23:47.360]  So the people who hate Alex Jones hate him because he is everything that they wish that
[23:47.360 --> 23:48.360]  they could be.
[23:48.360 --> 23:52.480]  Somebody who is willing to tell the truth, willing to fight for this country, and actually
[23:52.480 --> 23:55.880]  cares about humanity, not just America, but humanity as a whole.
[23:55.880 --> 23:56.880]  Yeah.
[23:56.880 --> 23:58.880]  He owns his own company and he has no advertisers.
[23:58.880 --> 24:01.280]  So he's kind of immune, really.
[24:01.280 --> 24:07.240]  And the only way to stop him is by destroying him with lawsuits, forgiving his opinion, which
[24:07.240 --> 24:11.120]  I guess is now a crime or something in the United States, so they're trying to do it
[24:11.120 --> 24:12.120]  that way.
[24:12.120 --> 24:13.120]  I couldn't agree.
[24:13.120 --> 24:14.320]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[24:14.320 --> 24:19.080]  And why do you think, I've already said why I didn't defend Alex Jones the day he was
[24:19.080 --> 24:20.080]  deep platformed.
[24:20.080 --> 24:21.580]  I wasn't in the country.
[24:21.580 --> 24:26.000]  But why do you think that more in conservative media didn't take a principle stand against
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.880]  censorship when that happened?
[24:27.880 --> 24:29.400]  Because Alex was off limits.
[24:29.400 --> 24:32.840]  Look at the fact that right now, Tucker, so many in conservative media who wouldn't even
[24:32.840 --> 24:36.240]  mention Alex Jones' name, now say his name on a regular basis.
[24:36.240 --> 24:38.480]  So Alex Jones is right, Alex Jones is right.
[24:38.480 --> 24:40.120]  We see this constantly, okay?
[24:40.120 --> 24:44.760]  The people in the conservative media or in the right wing even will not latch onto a
[24:44.760 --> 24:48.760]  specific narrative or tell the truth until it goes mainstream and they're allowed to
[24:48.760 --> 24:49.760]  do it.
[24:49.760 --> 24:55.040]  So even in the conservative and the right wing faction, the reason why we lose is because
[24:55.040 --> 24:59.640]  we continue to wait for the left, the liberal media, the mainstream media to allow us to
[24:59.640 --> 25:02.440]  tell us when we are allowed to tell the truth.
[25:02.440 --> 25:04.880]  Alex did that initially from day one.
[25:04.880 --> 25:09.880]  So I mean, I think that's why conservatives didn't stand up for him when they should have
[25:09.880 --> 25:12.040]  because they weren't allowed to at the time.
[25:12.040 --> 25:15.400]  I couldn't agree more, but you got to take a standing in censorship, I think.
[25:15.400 --> 25:18.880]  I mean, especially if you're in the media, I find Joy Reid loathsome.
[25:18.880 --> 25:21.480]  I think she's a race hater and she spreads race hate.
[25:21.480 --> 25:26.560]  However, if the government pushed for her to be censored, I would defend Joy Reid without
[25:26.560 --> 25:29.040]  even thinking about it because I'm against that, period.
[25:29.040 --> 25:31.640]  I don't care who it is, period.
[25:31.640 --> 25:34.160]  And I don't know why like national review can't take that stand.
[25:34.160 --> 25:35.560]  I think it's very, very odd.
[25:35.560 --> 25:36.560]  Yeah.
[25:36.560 --> 25:40.400]  Listen, I know we don't like Alex Jones and stuff, but listen, check this out, right?
[25:40.400 --> 25:41.400]  I like it.
[25:41.400 --> 25:42.400]  I know people don't know.
[25:42.400 --> 25:47.360]  But listen, whatever you think, whatever you think a human did to another human being,
[25:47.360 --> 25:48.360]  it happened.
[25:48.360 --> 25:49.360]  Yes.
[25:49.360 --> 25:52.400]  I mean, anything, I don't f**k with either whatever it happened.
[25:52.400 --> 25:53.680]  Somewhere in history, definitely happened.
[25:53.680 --> 25:54.680]  Yeah.
[25:54.680 --> 25:55.680]  Probably happened somewhere this year.
[25:55.680 --> 25:56.680]  Yes.
[25:56.680 --> 26:00.440]  And sometimes in these special camps and stuff that happened, these people owned these thousands
[26:00.440 --> 26:07.320]  of acres and nothing grows on them and just keep it weird ranches where people meet and
[26:07.320 --> 26:08.320]  do rituals.
[26:08.320 --> 26:09.320]  I want to hunt them.
[26:09.320 --> 26:10.320]  Mother f**k.
[26:10.320 --> 26:11.320]  Let them go.
[26:11.320 --> 26:12.320]  That's not outside the realm of possibility.
[26:12.320 --> 26:13.320]  I know that.
[26:13.320 --> 26:14.320]  I know that's why I'm throwing it at you.
[26:14.320 --> 26:20.160]  I guarantee you there's been someone somewhere in the world who paid someone to hunt a person.
[26:20.160 --> 26:21.520]  I guarantee you that's happened.
[26:21.520 --> 26:22.520]  No, no, no.
[26:22.520 --> 26:23.520]  This is what happened.
[26:23.520 --> 26:27.640]  They take these homeless people off the streets, put them in there, taking one of these special
[26:27.640 --> 26:31.160]  hospitals, they take them from that hospital, may have them drugged out, take them on these
[26:31.160 --> 26:40.440]  larger states of property, let's hunt, run, f**k, run, no, really, I really, I really
[26:40.440 --> 26:41.440]  believe that.
[26:41.440 --> 26:46.880]  I think, well, that book, the most dangerous game, didn't that come out in like the thirties?
[26:46.880 --> 26:52.200]  It's an old, old book about that very, very thing, rich people, the only reason we hunt
[26:52.200 --> 26:55.600]  the f**k, why is the only reason we hunt fox?
[26:55.600 --> 26:58.200]  I think there's the fur.
[26:58.200 --> 27:00.440]  The fox is the only one that backs tracks.
[27:00.440 --> 27:01.600]  Oh, because it's sneaky.
[27:01.600 --> 27:05.440]  He's the only one that backs tracks, like if he, if he chases, if he chases here, go
[27:05.440 --> 27:07.920]  forward and then come back with and go this way.
[27:07.920 --> 27:08.920]  To trick you.
[27:08.920 --> 27:12.960]  Yeah, that's, that's, that's why that's the only really challenging, that's the only
[27:12.960 --> 27:13.960]  challenging chase.
[27:13.960 --> 27:17.120]  Everything else is too easy, it's too simple-minded.
[27:17.120 --> 27:18.920]  The fox is the only one that's challenging.
[27:18.920 --> 27:19.920]  Oh, that's interesting.
[27:19.920 --> 27:21.920]  And so, I never thought about it that way.
[27:21.920 --> 27:25.680]  And so, now they say, well, the fox is the most reasonable animal.
[27:25.680 --> 27:29.920]  Let's try a human animal, see how reasonable he is.
[27:29.920 --> 27:30.920]  Guaranteed.
[27:30.920 --> 27:31.920]  Yeah.
[27:31.920 --> 27:32.920]  Guaranteed someone's done that.
[27:32.920 --> 27:33.920]  That's what they want to challenge.
[27:33.920 --> 27:34.920]  They want to challenge reasonability.
[27:34.920 --> 27:35.920]  Yeah.
[27:35.920 --> 27:40.880]  Let's see how he thinks, how does he think, how does he superior than us?
[27:40.880 --> 27:41.880]  Why are we superior?
[27:41.880 --> 27:45.200]  They're not going to do anything they think that's inferior than them.
[27:45.200 --> 27:46.200]  Yeah.
[27:46.200 --> 27:48.800]  They're going to, they're going to study what they're going to attack or what they're
[27:48.800 --> 27:50.800]  going to make their victim.
[27:50.800 --> 27:56.480]  That is, for sure, people have done that, right?
[27:56.480 --> 27:57.480]  That's fucking insane.
[27:57.480 --> 27:58.480]  It's called Cyclopia.
[27:58.480 --> 27:59.480]  Wow.
[27:59.480 --> 28:00.480]  I always thought that was a myth.
[28:00.480 --> 28:02.480]  I never knew that there was an actual disease.
[28:02.480 --> 28:04.920]  You're talking to me when you're talking about this.
[28:04.920 --> 28:06.960]  I'm like Alex Jones and you are, man.
[28:06.960 --> 28:07.960]  Ancient times.
[28:07.960 --> 28:09.960]  Can you make that a little bit bigger, Jamie?
[28:09.960 --> 28:10.960]  Right there?
[28:10.960 --> 28:11.960]  Yeah.
[28:11.960 --> 28:14.520]  Cyclopia is derived from the Greek word, Greek word, cyclops, meaning ring-eyed.
[28:14.520 --> 28:20.560]  It's a rare condition that causes a child to be born with one eye, no nose, and a probiscous
[28:20.560 --> 28:22.680]  and nose-like growth of the eye.
[28:22.680 --> 28:24.080]  Brother, I need to hit listen.
[28:24.080 --> 28:25.080]  There you go.
[28:25.080 --> 28:26.080]  I'm telling you.
[28:26.080 --> 28:29.720]  However, it isn't that a baby has one eye.
[28:29.720 --> 28:33.720]  It's a severe malformation of the baby's brain early in the pregnancy.
[28:33.720 --> 28:35.160]  Oh, wow.
[28:35.160 --> 28:39.680]  So both of the Cyclopia often results in miscarriage or stillbirth.
[28:39.680 --> 28:42.560]  Survival after birth is mostly a matter of a few hours.
[28:42.560 --> 28:47.200]  Doctors also call it holoprocenthophily.
[28:47.200 --> 28:54.560]  So imagine that they say 10,000 years, 100,000 years ago, maybe they did something where
[28:54.560 --> 28:59.800]  they were able to be accepted into the world.
[28:59.800 --> 29:03.160]  We have over 100 designs of t-shirts that just sit there in our warehouse.
[29:03.160 --> 29:08.000]  We need to sell those shirts to fund the operation, but we'd already made some orders on future
[29:08.000 --> 29:09.000]  shirts coming in.
[29:09.000 --> 29:10.000]  But these are all limited editions.
[29:10.000 --> 29:13.080]  So once these new shirts come in, we're going to sell those, and that's it.
[29:13.080 --> 29:17.320]  We'll have limited editions one at a time in the future, and when they're gone, they're
[29:17.320 --> 29:18.320]  gone.
[29:18.320 --> 29:19.840]  Well, here's the new limited edition shirt.
[29:19.840 --> 29:22.240]  This one is $24.95, a really nice fabric.
[29:22.240 --> 29:27.160]  Alex Jones was right on the front with a big red lightning bolt on the back, infowars.com.
[29:27.160 --> 29:31.160]  You talk about triggering, you talk about spreading the word, you talk about waking people up.
[29:31.160 --> 29:32.160]  Alex Jones was right.
[29:32.160 --> 29:35.560]  Fundraiser shirt, we need the funds to operate.

[30:00.440 --> 30:07.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarsstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20
[30:07.560 --> 30:09.360]  year history.
[30:09.360 --> 30:14.320]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[30:14.320 --> 30:20.240]  are broken down, and infowars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for
[30:20.240 --> 30:25.120]  operations and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalist making
[30:25.120 --> 30:26.120]  their main move.
[30:26.120 --> 30:30.400]  Infowars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people than
[30:30.400 --> 30:35.560]  ever despite the censorship, but because of cost-increasing and having to run our own infrastructure
[30:35.560 --> 30:39.840]  and pay for our own bandwidth, everything else, we are running out of money.
[30:39.840 --> 30:46.480]  So listen, up to 75% off of infowarsstore.com on things like amazing Patriot t-shirts that
[30:46.480 --> 30:52.240]  help spread the word and fund the operation, on supplements, on books, on films, everything
[30:52.240 --> 30:58.400]  is 25 to 75% off right now, the biggest sale in our history at infowarsstore.com.
[30:58.400 --> 31:00.600]  Thank you for your support.
[31:00.600 --> 31:02.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[31:02.360 --> 31:05.800]  I need your help keeping infowars on the air and strong.
[31:05.800 --> 31:09.800]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[31:09.800 --> 31:14.440]  I was born for this, you were born for this, and people are really waking up right now,
[31:14.440 --> 31:19.440]  but we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming
[31:19.440 --> 31:23.440]  that cost tens of millions of dollars and now, with Band-Aught Video getting close to
[31:23.440 --> 31:28.480]  10 million views a day, we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and
[31:28.480 --> 31:32.680]  groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[31:32.680 --> 31:37.560]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[31:37.560 --> 31:42.040]  Infowars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[31:42.040 --> 31:48.360]  movement worldwide, but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds
[31:48.360 --> 31:50.160]  and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[31:50.160 --> 31:54.440]  So the biggest sale in infowarshistory is going right now, the mega emergency blowout
[31:54.440 --> 32:00.040]  sale up to 75% off, getting credible products and keeping infowars as strong as ever.
[32:00.040 --> 32:04.520]  Introducing the newest product from infowarslife.com.
[32:04.520 --> 32:08.040]  We are so proud of infowarslife immune support.
[32:08.040 --> 32:15.760]  It is concentrated herbs that are known on record to supercharge our body's natural defenses.
[32:15.760 --> 32:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is something that is essential and everyone should get, and
[32:20.000 --> 32:23.760]  on top of it, it funds the info war so that's a 360 win.
[32:23.760 --> 32:26.800]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product.
[32:26.800 --> 32:32.800]  Concentrated elderberry, concentrated echinacea, concentrated astragalus root, angelica root,
[32:32.800 --> 32:35.280]  loatium root, and more.
[32:35.280 --> 32:37.520]  This product is incredible.
[32:37.520 --> 32:42.560]  Infowars immune support, exclusively available at infowarsstore.com, is funding the tip of
[32:42.560 --> 32:44.880]  the spear, the infowars operation.
[32:44.880 --> 32:46.240]  It is a 360 win.
[32:46.240 --> 32:50.720]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's
[32:50.720 --> 32:53.320]  natural defenses and keep infowars on the air.
[32:53.320 --> 32:55.760]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[32:55.760 --> 33:01.440]  Take action now, infowarsstore.com.
[33:01.440 --> 33:13.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:13.760 --> 33:39.680]  All right, I want everybody to listen to me very, very carefully and I want to describe
[33:39.680 --> 33:48.280]  first what we're facing and I want to describe to you a way to mitigate what we are already
[33:48.280 --> 33:49.280]  in.
[33:49.280 --> 33:56.720]  And I want you to understand that things are going to progressively get worse by design
[33:56.720 --> 34:03.800]  and the evil and the tyranny and the oppression will never end and will reach levels like
[34:03.800 --> 34:07.960]  something out of Hellraiser.
[34:07.960 --> 34:14.440]  If we don't recognize this now and see it for what it is, we've all heard of the frog
[34:14.440 --> 34:16.720]  in the boiling pot.
[34:16.720 --> 34:17.720]  It's true.
[34:17.720 --> 34:22.960]  If you throw a frog in a boiling pot of water, scalding hot water, it'll jump out.
[34:22.960 --> 34:27.560]  You put it in cold water and slowly turn the heat up, it will die.
[34:27.560 --> 34:28.560]  It will not escape.
[34:28.560 --> 34:33.120]  But we're not a frog, we're smarter than a frog.
[34:33.120 --> 34:37.440]  And so my great frustration is this.
[34:37.440 --> 34:42.400]  If you go back to shows we did 28 years ago, 25 years ago, 20 years ago, we talked about
[34:42.400 --> 34:50.360]  the plan to take over the infrastructure to slowly destroy civilization and to create
[34:50.360 --> 35:00.680]  a global collapse crisis out of which the one world government would take over.
[35:00.680 --> 35:06.640]  Now I don't deserve credit for knowing that.
[35:06.640 --> 35:08.960]  John Coleman was high level MI6.
[35:08.960 --> 35:12.920]  He came out with the plan 30 plus years ago.
[35:12.920 --> 35:16.880]  General Parton was the head of Air Force Weapons Development and the secret space program.
[35:16.880 --> 35:19.760]  He told me all of this.
[35:19.760 --> 35:23.760]  High level FBI agent Ted Gunderson told me everything.
[35:23.760 --> 35:32.920]  And those men now in hindsight and the John Burt society got it 100% right.
[35:32.920 --> 35:34.040]  We stand on their shoulders.
[35:34.040 --> 35:39.200]  And there were so many other people, I'm getting chills right now.
[35:39.200 --> 35:44.840]  And they would tell me stuff and I would then go to the UT library, I would go to the microfilm,
[35:44.840 --> 35:49.880]  the microfish and pull up David Rockefeller praising Mao Zedong and Communist China.
[35:49.880 --> 35:52.080]  I would pull up the Carnegie documents.
[35:52.080 --> 35:54.040]  I just couldn't believe it.
[35:54.040 --> 35:58.040]  And I couldn't believe other people didn't want to know about this plan.
[35:58.040 --> 36:05.520]  And Agenda 21 from the Rio de Janeiro meeting that Herbert Walker Bush signed on to.
[36:05.520 --> 36:08.960]  And so I knew that the world's elite were planning this.
[36:08.960 --> 36:14.040]  And I knew that if we warned people, we would have a chance to stop it.
[36:14.040 --> 36:19.720]  But I also thought about looking out to the future, what it would be like if we failed
[36:19.720 --> 36:25.200]  to stop the initiation of their final plan, what it would be like.
[36:25.200 --> 36:31.880]  And the last segment, I couldn't even go on air, so I went ahead and aired some clips.
[36:31.880 --> 36:40.560]  Because this is like when I've had family members come to me and say I love you a lot
[36:40.560 --> 36:42.840]  and I really appreciate you.
[36:42.840 --> 36:48.920]  And I've got terminal cancer and they say I'll be dead in six months.
[36:48.920 --> 36:53.120]  It's happened a couple of times and they smile at you and they tell you they love you.
[36:53.120 --> 36:58.840]  And then you're at their funeral and they're dead.
[36:58.840 --> 36:59.840]  And that's what this is.
[36:59.840 --> 37:06.440]  I'm here telling you that I'm going to die, you're going to die, we're all going to die.
[37:06.440 --> 37:09.400]  It's not like your grandma's sitting there having a cup of coffee across the table from
[37:09.400 --> 37:10.400]  you.
[37:10.400 --> 37:14.240]  Tell her that she's always going to love you and always going to be there, but that she's
[37:14.240 --> 37:17.360]  going to die.
[37:17.360 --> 37:20.560]  But life goes on through children and grandchildren, doesn't it?
[37:20.560 --> 37:23.040]  Except under this plan, it doesn't go on.
[37:23.040 --> 37:31.120]  So it's a death way worse than my other grandmother saying, I want to go home to my family and
[37:31.120 --> 37:35.040]  God, I'm going to stop eating at 92, I'm ready to die.
[37:35.040 --> 37:40.000]  And you say, I understand, I respect your decision, but you know they had a long life,
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.000]  they live on through you.
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.280]  And as long as you live on and your children live on and their children live on and we're
[37:44.280 --> 37:46.800]  good people, their life meant something.
[37:46.800 --> 37:51.960]  And if they cut us off like this, in this incredibly ancient journey of our species,
[37:51.960 --> 37:58.040]  it is, it is a crime never before committed on this planet that it's just so unspeakable
[37:58.040 --> 38:05.560]  that all our ancestors cry out and all of my will cries out and just begs all of you
[38:05.560 --> 38:11.640]  to realize there's a trillion distractions and they're all interesting and fun to cover.
[38:11.640 --> 38:17.240]  And all of this news is amazing, but it's all part and parcel of the spiritual fall
[38:17.240 --> 38:23.720]  of man and the spiritual battle we're in, and the fact that we're entering undoubtedly
[38:23.720 --> 38:32.280]  the end of days being initiated by the Antichrist forces making the way for their transhumanist
[38:32.280 --> 38:35.480]  God.
[38:35.480 --> 38:45.720]  And so on my metaphysical needs, I beg you on my knees to realize that this is the truth
[38:45.720 --> 38:52.480]  with, this is the transmission, this is the warning, this is why they fear us, this is
[38:52.480 --> 39:00.200]  why they hate me above anyone else, is because I know their plan and I was put in this position
[39:00.200 --> 39:06.640]  by God, none of it is me and I was carried along lesson after lesson after lesson after
[39:06.640 --> 39:11.960]  lesson in my life being prepared for where we are and you were prepared with your life
[39:11.960 --> 39:18.360]  lessons for where you are now to be a light in the world in this coming total darkness
[39:18.360 --> 39:23.360]  so that we can not let Satan have his total victory in the end, though the Bible tells
[39:23.360 --> 39:29.480]  us one fourth of the earth will be killed before the plan is reversed and it is going
[39:29.480 --> 39:33.920]  to be our action that will reverse that plan and it's going to be rough and it's going
[39:33.920 --> 39:39.440]  to be hard and a lot of us aren't going to make it, but that's okay because our spirits
[39:39.440 --> 39:47.000]  are eternal, but I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you and I stand
[39:47.000 --> 39:56.040]  with you forever and I know you stand with me.
[39:56.040 --> 40:01.920]  Now if your grandmother is telling you that she's going to die of lung cancer, with cancer
[40:01.920 --> 40:07.200]  in both lungs, it would kind of be morbid to tell you all about the details, but in this
[40:07.200 --> 40:13.280]  case it's not because if we don't describe what this is going to look like, if we don't
[40:13.280 --> 40:23.040]  stand up versus if we do stand up, then they're going to win and I understand, believe me,
[40:23.040 --> 40:30.280]  because I don't want to face this either, but I have faced it of what this is going
[40:30.280 --> 40:37.600]  to be like and if we don't admit we're under attack, if we don't admit we're being destroyed,
[40:37.600 --> 40:45.880]  if we don't admit we're being bullied and dominated by these monsters and their slaves,
[40:45.880 --> 40:53.280]  then we have no hope, but it is going to be in this process that we're going to find
[40:53.280 --> 41:00.160]  out who we really are and the greatest days of humanity have just begun.
[41:00.160 --> 41:10.640]  You're alive on the planet Earth at the moment of inception of our next level and there are
[41:10.640 --> 41:18.160]  a lot of very twisted, very old forces that hate us because of our success and what we've
[41:18.160 --> 41:28.080]  already done throughout the cosmos that are attempting to stop us here before this very
[41:28.080 --> 41:34.440]  important mission is launched.
[41:34.440 --> 41:49.000]  That mission is taking place in the third heaven and I could not even try to describe
[41:49.000 --> 41:57.760]  to you that just as they say one cannot be told about the matrix, you must see the devil's
[41:57.760 --> 42:06.320]  false construct, well it is even more intense to try to describe the next level.
[42:06.320 --> 42:11.280]  I have seen the next level, many of you have seen the next level and as the enemy pours
[42:11.280 --> 42:15.720]  out its attack to destroy us, if we are faithful and have courage and believe in God, God is
[42:15.720 --> 42:23.600]  going to give you the discernment and the blueprint and the download to defeat this
[42:23.600 --> 42:31.320]  mission, that is the great solace we have, but we must not hate God for being angry that
[42:31.320 --> 42:35.320]  we are being put through this because this is the experience of free will, this is the
[42:35.320 --> 42:40.000]  gift of consciousness and eternity, is that we must first before we're given God like
[42:40.000 --> 42:46.680]  power, face evil so that we know it and have physically, cellularly felt it so that we
[42:46.680 --> 42:50.880]  will not be part of it in the future, this is a cleansing, this is a ritual God is going
[42:50.880 --> 42:59.880]  to put us through, this is our boot camp and we will prevail, Jesus Christ is Lord and
[42:59.880 --> 43:00.880]  Savior.
[43:00.880 --> 43:07.560]  Over the years, Info Wars has produced more than 200 amazing patriot Americana Second Amendment

[43:26.320 --> 43:30.080]  selling them for $15, selling them for $20, whatever the shirt costs us, the shirt costs

[43:59.920 --> 44:07.360]  The globalist social insiders always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[44:07.360 --> 44:13.480]  until the populations rebelled, they would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[44:13.480 --> 44:19.720]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives, but because
[44:19.720 --> 44:26.080]  of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers,
[44:26.080 --> 44:32.720]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government
[44:32.720 --> 44:38.200]  corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever, the problem
[44:38.200 --> 44:42.800]  is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover, like Canada
[44:42.800 --> 44:48.960]  where they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other areas
[44:48.960 --> 44:53.600]  of the world are following suit like Australia, so pray for these folks big time, it's a very
[44:53.600 --> 44:59.680]  serious situation and stay tuned into infowarstore.com because truth is absolutely paramount.

[45:59.920 --> 46:04.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help, I need your help keeping info wars on the air
[46:04.200 --> 46:10.440]  and strong, I need your help making sure that our mission continues on, I was born for this,
[46:10.440 --> 46:14.880]  you were born for this and people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our
[46:14.880 --> 46:19.920]  own infrastructure because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions
[46:19.920 --> 46:25.280]  of dollars and now with Band-Aught video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[46:25.280 --> 46:31.240]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[46:31.240 --> 46:38.240]  of charge and because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22, info wars and Band-Aught
[46:38.240 --> 46:43.040]  video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide, but
[46:43.040 --> 46:48.200]  the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[46:48.200 --> 46:52.680]  of thousands of dollars a month, so the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now,
[46:52.680 --> 46:57.880]  the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off, getting incredible products and keep info wars
[46:57.880 --> 47:01.120]  as strong as ever.
[47:01.120 --> 47:15.520]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:15.520 --> 47:25.880]  To know the heights of good, let's know the depths of evil, I am very blessed and honored
[47:25.880 --> 47:37.080]  to be here with you, my friends, this Monday, April 25th, 22 broadcasts, and I can go over
[47:37.080 --> 47:45.240]  the ongoing shutdown like switches being turned off of the food infrastructure, police infrastructure,
[47:45.240 --> 47:55.240]  the security infrastructure, everything being turned in as a weapon against the people and
[47:55.240 --> 48:05.400]  I have over 50 pieces of evidence here today, it would be impossible to go over each one.
[48:05.400 --> 48:16.120]  But in the spars, Carnegie Rockefeller, Davos group, John Hopkins battle plan, they describe
[48:16.120 --> 48:22.800]  how once the collapse begins, they will admit that they've mismanaged and say they're sorry,
[48:22.800 --> 48:29.720]  but they've got a new plan for a universal basic income for you, you've just got to accept
[48:29.720 --> 48:36.800]  turning over and signing over everything you've got to it, or you'll lose it all, it's called
[48:36.800 --> 48:40.760]  being held hostage.
[48:40.760 --> 48:46.040]  So as we watch food production plants blow up on a daily basis across the U.S. and in
[48:46.040 --> 48:52.760]  other countries, as we watch the major pipelines cut off, as we watch the extinction rebellion
[48:52.760 --> 48:58.280]  cult members set themselves on fire in front of government buildings, as we watch Italy
[48:58.280 --> 49:03.240]  announce the rollout of a dystopian social credit score system to conserve resources
[49:03.240 --> 49:12.520]  first of its kind the EU, compliant citizen will be rewarded for good behavior.
[49:12.520 --> 49:19.920]  Those are quotes, climate lockdowns, your political views are good, you can leave your
[49:19.920 --> 49:22.160]  house.
[49:22.160 --> 49:31.040]  Why Governor Newsom is creating a water and energy disaster by design, FBI now admits
[49:31.040 --> 49:40.280]  they believe food facilities are being targeted, oh really, by infregard, by you, then you
[49:40.280 --> 49:46.920]  have IMF director, we didn't think through the consequences of printing too much money,
[49:46.920 --> 49:53.480]  we're already out of time, oh my goodness, the head of the IMF says, International Monetary
[49:53.480 --> 49:58.760]  Fund privately owned and run by the Rothschilds, that the banks are all insolvent, you're insolvent,
[49:58.760 --> 50:05.000]  the world economy is going to collapse, but don't worry, she's got a universal basic income
[50:05.000 --> 50:06.000]  for you.
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.760]  Here's the video clip, we printed too much money, I didn't think of any consequences,
[50:10.760 --> 50:18.440]  you know, you're just economists that do exactly what you were doing, IMF director,
[50:18.440 --> 50:29.480]  Christina Giorgio Vianna, there's another one, IMF director, maybe we printed too much
[50:29.480 --> 50:41.520]  money without thinking of any consequences, oh maybe, she goes on to say that the governments
[50:41.520 --> 50:45.160]  of the world are going to collapse and that the currencies are going to spike and we're
[50:45.160 --> 50:50.200]  going to have hyperinflation and that there's no way to fix it.
[50:50.200 --> 50:55.720]  Got all the clips right here, you want to hear a runner mouth, you want to hear the
[50:55.720 --> 50:59.720]  person that did it, somebody walks in your house and shoots you with a shotgun and then
[50:59.720 --> 51:06.480]  stands over your body and says, maybe I shouldn't have done that, maybe they shouldn't have
[51:06.480 --> 51:09.280]  flooded the borders, maybe they shouldn't have done a two year lockdown in the third
[51:09.280 --> 51:14.160]  world to starve everybody to death, maybe they shouldn't have sexualized the children,
[51:14.160 --> 51:18.280]  maybe they shouldn't have done all the things they did, they did it all on purpose, maybe
[51:18.280 --> 51:21.320]  they shouldn't have overthrown the Ukrainian government eight years ago and then attacked
[51:21.320 --> 51:25.600]  the Russian border, maybe they shouldn't have done this and that, but now they did and
[51:25.600 --> 51:30.720]  now they're in charge and now they want you to put handcuffs on digitally and accept this
[51:30.720 --> 51:38.760]  new wonderful app and total control of your life and then they promise it'll all be better,
[51:38.760 --> 51:44.080]  is it better in Australia where they put up with it, is it better in China where they
[51:44.080 --> 51:49.040]  submit to it, is it better in blue cities where they bow down, the answer of course
[51:49.040 --> 51:56.720]  is not, put these handcuffs on, let me tie you up and then everything will be all right,
[51:56.720 --> 51:59.720]  you believe that?
[51:59.720 --> 52:03.800]  But the average leftist has bought into this so they can't admit they're wrong, they're
[52:03.800 --> 52:09.000]  pretending because they get promoted on social media when they support it that they're part
[52:09.000 --> 52:20.800]  of the ruling group, but no one ever leaves traders alive, not even the bad guys because
[52:20.800 --> 52:28.040]  traders do what they do over and over and over again and our own corporate media is
[52:28.040 --> 52:37.320]  helping censor images of China and the martial law that they are under.
[52:37.320 --> 52:43.200]  So I've got three of these clips, four of these clips, but here's the director saying
[52:43.200 --> 52:50.920]  we printed too much money and didn't think about it, oh sure, here we are.
[52:50.920 --> 52:53.920]  Always.
[52:53.920 --> 52:56.400]  Madam MD.
[52:56.400 --> 53:03.560]  I think we are not paying sufficient attention to the law of unintended consequences.
[53:03.560 --> 53:12.840]  We take decisions with an objective in mind and rarely think through what may happen that
[53:12.840 --> 53:22.560]  is not our objective and then we wrestle with the impact of it.
[53:22.560 --> 53:31.480]  Take any decision that is a massive decision like the decision that we need to spend to
[53:31.480 --> 53:42.040]  support the economy and at that time we did recognize that mainly too much money in circulation
[53:42.040 --> 53:50.720]  to a few goods, but didn't really quite think through the consequence in a way that upfront
[53:50.720 --> 53:56.760]  would have informed better what we do and I subscribe entirely to what...
[53:56.760 --> 54:02.320]  Shut her up and she's up there with the former head Legronde of the IMF and it's all women.
[54:02.320 --> 54:07.240]  So it's like, oh, it's women, Madeline Albright killed a half million Iraqi children and said
[54:07.240 --> 54:13.000]  she did it on purpose, but she's a woman, oh, Tim Cook's gay, it's alright if he runs
[54:13.000 --> 54:14.840]  death camps.
[54:14.840 --> 54:19.160]  We're taught like bow down to these women in charge, bow down to gay men in charge.
[54:19.160 --> 54:23.400]  It's not about women or gay men, it's about, we're told, oh, they're the new group, they're
[54:23.400 --> 54:30.640]  the enlightened women, she's like, oh, we did not know, we did not know what we did when
[54:30.640 --> 54:34.840]  they used all those trillions they printed to buy up infrastructure themselves and now
[54:34.840 --> 54:40.640]  they hand us the debt and the inflation and then, oh, we did no lockdowns that collapse
[54:40.640 --> 54:48.800]  the third world, oh, we didn't know, they didn't know and the other clips where she
[54:48.800 --> 54:55.240]  says sovereign debt will fail, nations will fail, the stock markets will fail, but don't
[54:55.240 --> 55:01.680]  worry, we've got a cashless society, we've got programmable tokens that track everything
[55:01.680 --> 55:09.960]  you do and tell you where you can spend your money and it's all run by little gay men and
[55:09.960 --> 55:15.120]  women in little dresses, so it's like, because our epigenetics thinks of like Vikings or
[55:15.120 --> 55:21.440]  whoever, like a bunch of men, right, we'll fight that, but it's women, oh, we did not
[55:21.440 --> 55:29.480]  know, look, gay men here, oh, I'm gay, oh, I run death camps, oh, you see how it works
[55:29.480 --> 55:34.240]  and they're literally a death cult on private jets with giant private mansions and hundred
[55:34.240 --> 55:39.680]  thousand acre ranches, laughing at all of you, they want to just kill and get rid of
[55:39.680 --> 55:46.400]  some bimbo blonde up there and then everybody else just goes along with it, we're going
[55:46.400 --> 55:49.640]  to start the next hour, Roger Stone's coming in, I haven't even got into half of this,
[55:49.640 --> 55:53.040]  after he leaves in 30 hours, I'm going to go over it all, believe me, this is all incredibly
[55:53.040 --> 55:59.240]  important news, but separately, I'm not funded by the IMF or World Bank or by Jordan Soros
[55:59.240 --> 56:04.000]  by the New World Order, I'm funded by you and I want to thank you for coming through
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.360]  with the money bomb and bringing in over a million dollars over three days with the product
[56:08.360 --> 56:12.640]  sales and the cost, we brought in over a half million dollars, thank you, that supplements
[56:12.640 --> 56:16.960]  what we're doing, we're taking on pure tyranny at point blank range, if I had billions I
[56:16.960 --> 56:21.320]  could defeat them, but with millions I could fight them, go to infoworkstore.com, we've
[56:21.320 --> 56:25.480]  sold out of half of the 60 something thousand t-shirts we had that have been backlogged
[56:25.480 --> 56:29.560]  and never promoted, we've got a lot of great products out there and I've got a really exciting
[56:29.560 --> 56:34.280]  announcement here, X2 sold out for many, many months, the highest quality deep-growth

[57:40.520 --> 57:54.840]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand InfoWars, I've been on here a couple
[57:54.840 --> 57:59.880]  of years but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show and I wanted
[57:59.880 --> 58:04.040]  to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge the globalist
[58:04.040 --> 58:09.280]  and it was a t-shirt I designed, the first one, mass murderers agree gun control works
[58:09.280 --> 58:13.720]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew, that's our oldest design
[58:13.720 --> 58:18.360]  and we're still selling it, we have that design over a hundred others that will now all be
[58:18.360 --> 58:23.240]  limited editions because whatever stock we've got in, that's it, we're selling everything
[58:23.240 --> 58:28.120]  out to fund the operation, to get rid of inventory, we'll still have some t-shirts in the future,

[1:00:14.440 --> 1:00:43.080]  And just as the emic was publicly forecasted, amongst its conspirators months before its
[1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:49.000]  rollout, so too it goes with the coming cyber warfare predictive programming of the flip
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.800]  of the power grid kill switch.
[1:00:51.800 --> 1:00:58.440]  Cyber attacks must be treated as a serious threat by our leadership, the highest levels.
[1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:03.880]  Look today, my administration is to renew warnings that based on evolving intelligence,
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:07.080]  Russia may be planning a cyber attack against us.
[1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:36.040]  But which governments have embedded what is known as the Swiss army knife of malware
[1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:57.440]  into critical infrastructure, all signs point to the United States government.
[1:01:57.440 --> 1:02:03.800]  As the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency wrote in their alert for the APT cyber
[1:02:03.800 --> 1:02:12.560]  tools targeting ICS SC ADA devices, the Department of Energy, the Cyber Security and Infrastructure
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:18.120]  Security Agency, the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are
[1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:25.180]  releasing this joint cybersecurity advisory to warn that certain advanced persistent threat
[1:02:25.180 --> 1:02:32.160]  actors have exhibited the capability to gain full system access to multiple industrial control
[1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:39.680]  systems, supervisory control and data acquisition devices, including Schneider Electric Programmable
[1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:47.920]  Logic Controllers, Omron, CISMAC, NEXT PLCs and open platform communications unified architecture
[1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:48.920]  servers.
[1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:57.120]  There is an energy producer in Texas who has identified a very serious malware instance
[1:02:57.120 --> 1:02:58.640]  in their system.
[1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:04.840]  This malware is not just in systems like a Windows Vista that is sitting in one of these
[1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:05.840]  plants.
[1:03:05.840 --> 1:03:11.560]  No, it is in the Schneider Electric Programmable Logic Controllers, that's a PLC.
[1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:18.220]  It is in the Omron, CISMAC, NEXT PLCs and the open platform communications unified architecture
[1:03:18.220 --> 1:03:19.720]  servers.
[1:03:19.720 --> 1:03:26.360]  Some of this stuff could only be put into these devices at the manufacturer.
[1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:31.840]  And so when I asked our dude named Ben Protector of Megawatt, he said, what does it look like
[1:03:31.840 --> 1:03:32.840]  to you?
[1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:37.680]  These guys look at this stuff all day long, they say, Russian, because the Russians are
[1:03:37.680 --> 1:03:39.320]  the ones that people really do fear.
[1:03:39.320 --> 1:03:42.680]  You know, if you got the ghost in the machine, these guys are good.
[1:03:42.680 --> 1:03:50.520]  He says, this looks like our guys without making a formal accusation, of course.
[1:03:50.520 --> 1:03:55.880]  Of course, there's people who are doing reports on it, but it is not the hold on to your ass
[1:03:55.880 --> 1:04:01.120]  because the lights could go out in Texas or New York or anywhere.
[1:04:01.120 --> 1:04:02.360]  This would be the one.
[1:04:02.360 --> 1:04:07.040]  And they're not making a big deal out of it, which makes me highly suspicious.
[1:04:07.040 --> 1:04:12.240]  This move will plummet civilization into chaos in total submission, unless you are one of
[1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:16.080]  the lucky few that has already made preparations.
[1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:29.400]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's
[1:04:29.400 --> 1:04:37.640]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:59.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:02.360]  We have over a hundred designs and t-shirts that just sit there in our warehouse.
[1:05:02.360 --> 1:05:07.200]  We need to sell those shirts to fund the operation, but we'd already made some orders on future
[1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:08.200]  shirts coming in.
[1:05:08.200 --> 1:05:09.200]  But these are all limited editions.
[1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:12.240]  So once these new shirts come in, we're going to sell those, and that's it.
[1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:16.480]  We'll have limited editions one at a time in the future, and when they're gone, they're
[1:05:16.480 --> 1:05:17.480]  gone.
[1:05:17.480 --> 1:05:19.000]  Well, here's the new limited edition shirt.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.720]  This one is $24.95, a really nice fabric.
[1:05:21.720 --> 1:05:26.600]  Alex Jones was right on the front with a big red lightning bolt on the back, Infowars.com.
[1:05:26.600 --> 1:05:30.320]  You talk about triggering, you talk about spreading the word, you talk about waking people up.
[1:05:30.320 --> 1:05:31.320]  Alex Jones was right.
[1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:34.760]  Fundraiser shirt, we need the funds to operate.
[1:05:34.760 --> 1:05:35.760]  Infowarsstore.com.
[1:05:35.760 --> 1:05:38.160]  Alex Jones was right, it's a gorgeous shirt.
[1:05:38.160 --> 1:05:39.160]  We're really proud of it.

[1:05:45.760 --> 1:05:49.520]  Be part of history, support free speech, be a maverick, be a rebel.
[1:05:49.520 --> 1:05:55.040]  You can't do that in a better way than wearing an Alex Jones was right shirt with Infowars.com,
[1:05:55.040 --> 1:06:12.480]  big on the back, available now for limited time, Infowarsstore.com.
[1:06:12.480 --> 1:06:17.880]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:22.200]  Well, he's never been in the studio, though I've been in the studio for two and a half
[1:06:22.200 --> 1:06:28.720]  years, Roger Stone pinned down by fake charges, falsely convicted by kangaroo court in D.C.
[1:06:28.720 --> 1:06:29.720]  pardoned.
[1:06:29.720 --> 1:06:35.800]  The 45th President of the United States is in studio with us right now.
[1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:38.640]  You can see all the rain droplets on me, I walked out and got something out of my car.
[1:06:38.640 --> 1:06:43.120]  It's pouring down, rain here in Austin, but the tyranny is pouring down as well.
[1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:47.720]  I want to talk big picture, I want to talk the upcoming midterms, I want to talk Trump,
[1:06:47.720 --> 1:06:51.000]  I want to talk to Samus, I want to talk it all with you here today.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:55.040]  But it dawned on me, you've not been here in two and a half years because for a while,
[1:06:55.040 --> 1:06:58.720]  you weren't even allowed to leave Florida.
[1:06:58.720 --> 1:07:01.760]  Just simply incredible what we've been through, Roger.
[1:07:01.760 --> 1:07:06.240]  And now you and I again, with the fake January 6th thing, are in their false crosshairs again.
[1:07:06.240 --> 1:07:08.640]  You know, Alex, I feel like I'm back home.
[1:07:08.640 --> 1:07:12.200]  I mean, it's like a reunion, it's great to be here.
[1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:18.320]  So much has changed about Infowars, it's gotten so much bigger, so much better, yet the attacks
[1:07:18.320 --> 1:07:22.840]  have gotten so much, the velocity of them is really extraordinary.
[1:07:22.840 --> 1:07:25.840]  They are desperate to shut down Infowars.
[1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:29.840]  It is, it is the beacon of truth out there.
[1:07:29.840 --> 1:07:34.080]  And so many other people have come around to what you were saying five years ago.
[1:07:34.080 --> 1:07:38.200]  What you and I were saying in this studio, not the studio, but in this building just
[1:07:38.200 --> 1:07:45.600]  years ago, and it's all come to pass, as our mutual friend Tucker Carlson says, they don't
[1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:48.040]  act like people who have a lot of time.
[1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:53.440]  They act like people who are frantic against the Constitution and our freedoms because
[1:07:53.440 --> 1:07:55.080]  they are running out of time.
[1:07:55.080 --> 1:07:57.240]  They know they're a minority.
[1:07:57.240 --> 1:07:59.000]  They know that we are the majority.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:00.640]  They know people are waking up.
[1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:07.240]  They know Infowars and frankspeech.com and a handful of others, Real America's Voice,
[1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:08.240]  Right Side Broadcasting.
[1:08:08.240 --> 1:08:14.200]  There are very few patriotic outlets out there where the truth can still be heard, but the
[1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:15.960]  American people are waking up.
[1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:18.160]  And that's because of Infowars.
[1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:19.160]  I agree.
[1:08:19.160 --> 1:08:23.520]  I want to tell the globalists, even if they can shut down OAN or URI or anybody else,
[1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:28.160]  the public gets what's happened now and that there's a foreign globalist pro-Chicom force
[1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:29.160]  destroying us.
[1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:33.680]  So even if they silence all of us, America's too far awake now, no matter what they pull
[1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:34.680]  or what they do.
[1:08:34.680 --> 1:08:36.320]  I don't see them getting out of this.
[1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:37.600]  I agree with that, Alex.
[1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:46.800]  I mean, between gas prices, food shortages, crippling inflation, the indominious defeat
[1:08:46.800 --> 1:08:51.960]  of the United States around the globe, a foreign policy that makes no sense to anyone, the
[1:08:51.960 --> 1:08:59.120]  fake war in Ukraine, which is not even remotely about what they say it's about.
[1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:03.520]  People who voted for Joe Biden come up to me in public and say what a mistake they made.
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:10.000]  So there is a red tide coming, but it's important that people understand that the election of
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:16.880]  a Republican majority in the House and the Senate will change nothing whatsoever.
[1:09:16.880 --> 1:09:21.560]  The key here is to have a subset of patriots in both houses.
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:27.760]  It could be 10 to 15 stout men and women in the House, as many as three or four in the
[1:09:27.760 --> 1:09:33.760]  Senate who can use their leverage to change the agenda and save the country.
[1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:36.800]  I want you to stop, because what you're saying is the key to everything.
[1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:41.280]  The Republican establishment, the neo-Konsor ally with the Democrat deep state, the permanent
[1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:45.720]  state to shut down a populist movement that they fear that came through Trump, now the
[1:09:45.720 --> 1:09:47.840]  Santas and others.
[1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:52.880]  And so the key here is realizing just getting Republicans elected is not a panacea.
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:56.720]  It's having those hardcore groups to blow the whistle, to bully pulpit and expose what
[1:09:56.720 --> 1:09:58.600]  happens to be that key swing vote.
[1:09:58.600 --> 1:09:59.600]  There's no question.
[1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:03.920]  So, and people who are still sending their money to the Republican National Committee
[1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:08.400]  or sending their money to the Republican Congressional Committee, the Senatorial Committee, please,
[1:10:08.400 --> 1:10:14.120]  folks, go to the M4 site, send that contribution here, or send it to my legal defense funds.
[1:10:14.120 --> 1:10:17.160]  And the Democrats aren't attacking the main line of Republicans, they're attacking us
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:18.800]  because we're leading the populist movement.
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:19.800]  That's why they fear us.
[1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:21.640]  There's no question.
[1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:23.720]  And the next three months are crucial.
[1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:28.240]  In other words, the Republican primaries in May and June and then August, because there
[1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:33.880]  aren't many in July, that's going to determine whether the Republic survives or not.
[1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:38.040]  My friend General Flynn, who I love and who I think is a great American, great patriot,
[1:10:38.040 --> 1:10:42.720]  great Christian, great constitutionalist, has a line where he says, we only have, you
[1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:44.640]  know, maybe five years to save the country.
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:46.120]  I totally agree with that.
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:49.640]  I mean, I think it's six months to two years at the very outset, but they know they're
[1:10:49.640 --> 1:10:53.880]  losing so they're going for broke to bring in a permanent authoritarian system.
[1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:54.880]  There's no question.
[1:10:54.880 --> 1:11:01.000]  And that's why the January 6th thing and the abuse of the detainees, that's supposed
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:04.080]  to show everybody what will happen if you stand up to them.
[1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:09.920]  I mean, a complete denial of due process, people being beaten, people being tortured,
[1:11:09.920 --> 1:11:14.280]  people being kept in solitary confinement for the egregious crime of trespassing.
[1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:16.200]  This is North Korea stuff.
[1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:19.880]  Not being allowed to shade, not being allowed to medical attention, not being allowed to
[1:11:19.880 --> 1:11:27.080]  shower, not being allowed to defecate, being denied due process, not being given in discovery,
[1:11:27.080 --> 1:11:29.160]  what they're entitled to under the law.
[1:11:29.160 --> 1:11:32.400]  The Attorney General could change all of this with a phone call.
[1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:33.400]  He doesn't.
[1:11:33.400 --> 1:11:35.200]  It is a violation of the Constitution.
[1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:37.480]  It's a violation of the Geneva Conventions.
[1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:40.320]  It's the greatest single scandal of our lifetime.
[1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:41.320]  It's a danger.
[1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:43.320]  They've set up Guantanamo Bay in DC.
[1:11:43.320 --> 1:11:44.320]  They really have.
[1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:50.120]  They've had blood, feces, infested, gulag, and they'd like to lock Roger Stone and Alex
[1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:54.360]  Jones in there, except for we don't know anything about it.
[1:11:54.360 --> 1:11:55.360]  Not involved.
[1:11:55.360 --> 1:11:57.560]  I think it was a bad idea.
[1:11:57.560 --> 1:12:03.520]  You and I went to Washington for the simple purpose of winning a 10-day delay in the certification
[1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:11.240]  of the Electoral College so that the irregularities in a handful of states like Arizona, like Georgia,
[1:12:11.240 --> 1:12:14.480]  and Michigan could be examined more closely.
[1:12:14.480 --> 1:12:15.720]  That's not seditious.
[1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:16.800]  It's not treasonous.
[1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:17.800]  It's not illegal.
[1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:19.120]  It's not improper.
[1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:22.840]  We have an absolute constitutional right to speak out for that.
[1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:26.520]  They want to make that a criminal activity.
[1:12:26.520 --> 1:12:28.560]  They want to make that a crime.
[1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:34.640]  They want to take constitutionally protected political activity and free speech and make
[1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:35.640]  it a crime.
[1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:41.480]  That's right, for listeners that know that January 6th was a provocative action, like
[1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:45.720]  the Whitmer situation, they're sick of hearing about it, but they have to understand this
[1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:48.000]  is the beta test for everybody else.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:52.920]  This is everything the establishment, deep state Democrats and neocons are betting on
[1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:55.440]  with 197 days out for the midterms.
[1:12:55.440 --> 1:12:59.120]  Well, in history, he's repeating himself, the prosecution, the prosecution of Paul
[1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:03.960]  Manafort, the prosecution of General Flynn, the prosecution of Roger Stone.
[1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:09.200]  That was mostly a signal to others that resistance was futile, that you couldn't resist the deep
[1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:11.320]  state or they would destroy you.
[1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:15.640]  Only through the grace of God am I here with you today, Alex.
[1:13:15.640 --> 1:13:21.400]  When I said that in a speech at the Republican State Convention in Utah in Salt Lake City,
[1:13:21.400 --> 1:13:26.840]  I was assaulted by the Huffington Post because I believe in Jesus Christ.
[1:13:26.840 --> 1:13:32.880]  They say, oh no, Stone attributes his salvation to Christ, not likely, they say.
[1:13:32.880 --> 1:13:33.880]  It's outrageous.
[1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:39.360]  And now they're denigrating your religious beliefs, unbelievable.
[1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:43.360]  They're incredibly desperate and everybody's turning against them.
[1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:46.880]  Biden is on TV taking orders from the Easter Bunny.
[1:13:46.880 --> 1:13:48.640]  You can't make that up.
[1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:49.960]  How do they get rid of Biden?
[1:13:49.960 --> 1:13:50.960]  What do they do?
[1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:52.960]  I mean, they have destroyed themselves.
[1:13:52.960 --> 1:14:00.160]  Well, I believe that the new media coverage of the Hunter Biden laptop and the extraordinary
[1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:08.680]  corruption and treason, child sex exploitation, drug abuse there, once the New York Times
[1:14:08.680 --> 1:14:14.120]  and the Washington Post and CNN and the networks begin covering that, that's the signal that
[1:14:14.120 --> 1:14:16.880]  the establishment is ready to dump Joe Biden.
[1:14:16.880 --> 1:14:23.920]  In other words, Alex, between the food, the gas prices, the food shortages, the inflation,
[1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:31.200]  the defeats around the globe, add to that the corruption and the entire Hunter Biden scandal,
[1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:36.960]  and Joe Biden's inability to perform and even be cogent in public.
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:40.280]  The establishment has signaled now he will be dumped.
[1:14:40.280 --> 1:14:47.320]  So I predict that after the election, they themselves will enact the 25th Amendment
[1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:49.160]  and remove him.
[1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:51.400]  And they will lionize him while they're doing it.
[1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:54.640]  This great statesman is just too ill to do the job.
[1:14:54.640 --> 1:15:00.920]  He gave 100% to his country, but now because he's not well, we have to sideline him for
[1:15:00.920 --> 1:15:02.440]  his own good.
[1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:09.200]  Remember it takes a majority of the cabinet plus the vice president under the 25th Amendment
[1:15:09.200 --> 1:15:10.520]  to remove Joe Biden.
[1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:11.720]  So when does it happen?
[1:15:11.720 --> 1:15:15.480]  Right after the election, almost immediately after the election, because Joe Biden is too
[1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:18.960]  heavy a burden to carry into another presidential election.
[1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:23.600]  I don't rule out that it could happen before, but I think it is probably too late.
[1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:28.840]  So there's the Roger Stone prognostication, which I agree with.
[1:15:28.840 --> 1:15:34.360]  Biden, puppet Biden will be removed after midterms.
[1:15:34.360 --> 1:15:36.520]  That's my prediction and I will stand by it.
[1:15:36.520 --> 1:15:39.240]  I'll come back on the show when I'm proven right.
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:40.480]  You will be proven right.
[1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:44.240]  I mean, he came and I'm probably, I'll be surprised if you can go that long.
[1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:46.680]  But you're saying in a couple hundred days, he'll be gone.
[1:15:46.680 --> 1:16:01.720]  We'll be right back info wars.com tomorrow's news today is about 25 years ago that I wanted
[1:16:01.720 --> 1:16:02.720]  to expand info wars.
[1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:06.880]  I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple
[1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:07.880]  little local radio show.
[1:16:07.880 --> 1:16:09.440]  And I wanted to hire camera people.
[1:16:09.440 --> 1:16:10.440]  I wanted to make films.
[1:16:10.440 --> 1:16:13.680]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt.
[1:16:13.680 --> 1:16:19.800]  I designed the first one mass murderers agree gun control works that helped us finance hiring
[1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:21.320]  the first two members of my crew.
[1:16:21.320 --> 1:16:24.080]  That's our oldest design and he's still selling.
[1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:28.680]  We have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions because
[1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:33.680]  whatever stock we've got in, that's that we're selling everything out to find the operation
[1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:34.680]  to get rid of inventory.
[1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:36.680]  We'll still have some teachers in the future.
[1:16:36.680 --> 1:16:38.680]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[1:16:38.680 --> 1:16:43.080]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance on almost
[1:16:43.080 --> 1:16:44.080]  everything.
[1:16:44.080 --> 1:16:45.080]  I forgot.
[1:16:45.080 --> 1:16:47.840]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[1:16:47.840 --> 1:16:53.480]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts,
[1:16:53.480 --> 1:16:59.240]  designer shirts, they're all selling at cost infowarstore.com.
[1:16:59.240 --> 1:17:08.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[1:17:08.200 --> 1:17:13.160]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[1:17:13.160 --> 1:17:18.920]  have broken down, and info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying
[1:17:18.920 --> 1:17:19.920]  for operations.
[1:17:19.920 --> 1:17:24.280]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their main
[1:17:24.280 --> 1:17:25.280]  move.
[1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:29.240]  Info wars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people than
[1:17:29.240 --> 1:17:31.320]  ever despite the censorship.
[1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:34.920]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our
[1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:38.640]  own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.

[1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:16.120]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.

[1:19:54.760 --> 1:20:00.360]  Take action now, infowarsstore.com.
[1:20:00.360 --> 1:20:10.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:10.680 --> 1:20:19.240]  Well, he's in battle.
[1:20:19.240 --> 1:20:20.520]  He's a former political president.
[1:20:20.520 --> 1:20:21.520]  He's Roger Stone.
[1:20:21.520 --> 1:20:25.920]  He's here with us live in studio in Austin, Texas, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[1:20:25.920 --> 1:20:29.720]  So Roger, you got a lot of stuff I want to cover with you in the next 45 minutes or so,
[1:20:29.720 --> 1:20:33.760]  but you want to get into Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leadership.
[1:20:33.760 --> 1:20:36.960]  What's come out about them, and then what's unfolding?
[1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:39.920]  I think this is absolutely key.
[1:20:39.920 --> 1:20:45.400]  Unfortunately, President Trump seems to be deferring to Kevin McCarthy on some of these
[1:20:45.400 --> 1:20:49.840]  crucial endorsements, and I think that is an enormous mistake.
[1:20:49.840 --> 1:20:57.720]  McCarthy, we now know, not only told Liz Cheney on audio tape that Trump should be removed
[1:20:57.720 --> 1:21:03.760]  or should resign, and that he would tell Vice President Pence, who would then rise to the
[1:21:03.760 --> 1:21:07.920]  presidency, not to pardon the former president.
[1:21:07.920 --> 1:21:09.440]  That's treasonous.
[1:21:09.440 --> 1:21:10.520]  That's backstabbing.
[1:21:10.520 --> 1:21:11.840]  That's not acceptable.
[1:21:11.840 --> 1:21:16.880]  And then making it worse, we also know from the same source on audio, so he can't deny
[1:21:16.880 --> 1:21:23.080]  it, that he urged Twitter to de-platform three members of the Republican caucus.
[1:21:23.080 --> 1:21:26.360]  The big guessing game in Washington right now is who were the three?
[1:21:26.360 --> 1:21:27.960]  Was it Marjorie Taylor Greene?
[1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:29.480]  Was it Matt Gaetz?
[1:21:29.480 --> 1:21:30.480]  Was it Jim Jordan?
[1:21:30.480 --> 1:21:31.480]  Who was it?
[1:21:31.480 --> 1:21:35.400]  And isn't it amazing that they're recording him, and that's not even an issue?
[1:21:35.400 --> 1:21:36.400]  It's really extraordinary.
[1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:40.480]  By the way, all this comes out of the New York Times, so normally I would be completely
[1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:41.480]  skeptical about it.
[1:21:41.480 --> 1:21:45.600]  I would think it didn't really happen, except for they have audio recordings.
[1:21:45.600 --> 1:21:51.480]  This is the same Kevin McCarthy who approved billions of dollars to Big Pharma for the
[1:21:51.480 --> 1:21:53.560]  COVID-19 hoax.
[1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:58.400]  The same Kevin McCarthy, by the way, who only said days ago that if we win a Republican
[1:21:58.400 --> 1:22:03.800]  majority, he will not move articles of impeachment against Joe Biden.
[1:22:03.800 --> 1:22:08.840]  Now, what we know, the little we know from the laptop already, there's more than enough
[1:22:08.840 --> 1:22:15.080]  grounds for impeachment of Joe Biden, certainly far more than the completely bogus efforts
[1:22:15.080 --> 1:22:19.480]  to impeach Donald Trump, but we already have from McCarthy.
[1:22:19.480 --> 1:22:20.480]  There it is.
[1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:23.320]  He doesn't, he's not playing for keeps.
[1:22:23.320 --> 1:22:27.720]  This guy doesn't have the courage to be the speaker of the House and take the fight to
[1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:28.720]  the Democrats.
[1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:34.680]  I'm not against gay people, but he lives with Frank Launce.
[1:22:34.680 --> 1:22:36.120]  Is he blackmailed?
[1:22:36.120 --> 1:22:39.560]  Is he like the wife of Frank Launce, or is he the husband?
[1:22:39.560 --> 1:22:46.120]  Now, ironically, he withdrew from an earlier leadership contest, you may remember when
[1:22:46.120 --> 1:22:51.720]  Bob Livingston, Congressman from Louisiana, was in line to become the Republican leader.
[1:22:51.720 --> 1:22:54.800]  There was a contest, McCarthy stepped forward.
[1:22:54.800 --> 1:22:59.360]  It was then revealed that he was having an extramarital affair with a Congresswoman from
[1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:00.360]  North Carolina.
[1:23:00.360 --> 1:23:05.240]  This was reported by the Washington Examiner, picked up by Drudge, McCarthy withdrew from
[1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:06.560]  the contest.
[1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:10.280]  I don't know what the nature of his relationship with Frank Launce is, other than to say that
[1:23:10.280 --> 1:23:18.360]  I find it very weird that a grown man who's married has a roommate in Washington, D.C.
[1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:23.040]  who looks like he has a Danish stapled on his head.
[1:23:23.040 --> 1:23:30.280]  So everybody's turning against the establishment right now.
[1:23:30.280 --> 1:23:31.480]  What are they going to do?
[1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:33.520]  Well, you're right about that.
[1:23:33.520 --> 1:23:42.200]  I mean, I'm looking at poll results in California, in Nevada, in New Jersey, in Pennsylvania,
[1:23:42.200 --> 1:23:43.200]  in Florida.
[1:23:43.200 --> 1:23:45.360]  So I'm not just looking at one region of the country.
[1:23:45.360 --> 1:23:50.440]  Alex, I have never seen the kind of volatility that I'm looking at right now.
[1:23:50.440 --> 1:23:55.600]  By that I mean people are completely fed up with the political establishment, with the
[1:23:55.600 --> 1:23:57.000]  political elites.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:58.720]  They don't trust the networks.
[1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:01.480]  They don't trust the cable news outlets.
[1:24:01.480 --> 1:24:03.240]  They don't trust politicians.
[1:24:03.240 --> 1:24:04.920]  They don't trust either party.
[1:24:04.920 --> 1:24:07.360]  I've never seen this kind of volatility.
[1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:13.120]  And what it means is that things are politically possible that would never have been possible
[1:24:13.120 --> 1:24:14.120]  before.
[1:24:14.120 --> 1:24:17.440]  Meaning, if you are a Republican U.S. Senator, you're going to get reelected.
[1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:21.760]  The odds are overwhelming, virtually impossible to mount a challenge to you.
[1:24:21.760 --> 1:24:24.000]  That is no longer the case.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:30.440]  The people are angry, they're pissed, and they're looking for non-politicians for the answers.
[1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:36.920]  Farm limits, which always was the most powerful issue on our side, has to be up front yet
[1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:38.080]  again.
[1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:42.720]  But what we can't have is people like Mark Wayne Mullen from Oklahoma.
[1:24:42.720 --> 1:24:44.720]  This guy's running for the U.S. Senate.
[1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:51.800]  Alex, he praised the Capitol Hill police officer, Johnny Byrd, the guy who shot an unarmed veteran,
[1:24:51.800 --> 1:24:54.040]  Ashley Babbitt, in cold blood.
[1:24:54.040 --> 1:24:58.720]  He praised this officer as a hero.
[1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:04.440]  Then I go check, when running for the House in eastern Oklahoma, he pledged to run for
[1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:11.200]  only three terms, then he violated his pledge, ran for a fourth term, and now he wants to
[1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:13.080]  be a U.S. Senator.
[1:25:13.080 --> 1:25:14.080]  And he calls himself a conservative.
[1:25:14.080 --> 1:25:20.000]  Well, our biggest issue is globalists and just grifters and scammers that say they're
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  Republican.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  And that's the problem with Trump.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:27.280]  Our good friend, your really good friend, he keeps just endorsing, some good, but a lot
[1:25:27.280 --> 1:25:28.280]  of bad people.
[1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:29.560]  Look, I love Donald Trump.
[1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:30.960]  He saved my life.
[1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:33.560]  I will always be eternally loyal to him.
[1:25:33.560 --> 1:25:36.600]  When I agree with him, I yell it from the rooftops.
[1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:41.520]  When I disagree, frankly, I'm discreet about it because I owe him my life.
[1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:46.400]  And I still think it's amazing how much he got accomplished, considering...
[1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:47.520]  Yeah, but I agree.
[1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:50.000]  So why is he endorsing some terms?
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:51.440]  Because I think he's getting bad advice.
[1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:55.320]  I think there is a disproportionate amount of influence by McCarthy.
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:25:56.520]  Let's take an example.
[1:25:56.520 --> 1:26:01.800]  The fourth district of New Jersey, the Trumpiest district in the Northeast United States.
[1:26:01.800 --> 1:26:04.280]  Trump won it by 26 percent.
[1:26:04.280 --> 1:26:05.800]  Chris Smith is the congressman.
[1:26:05.800 --> 1:26:13.960]  He's been there for 42 years, voted for the Green New Deal, voted for the vaccination
[1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:14.960]  registration database.
[1:26:14.960 --> 1:26:17.520]  He's a devil's group minion.
[1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:19.080]  He's awful.
[1:26:19.080 --> 1:26:23.480]  Mike Crispy, a conservative commentator, comes forward to challenge him.
[1:26:23.480 --> 1:26:28.040]  McCarthy is essentially blocking Trump's endorsement of Crispy.
[1:26:28.040 --> 1:26:29.040]  So sifting gears.
[1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:35.200]  How much trouble is McCarthy in with the bases?
[1:26:35.200 --> 1:26:36.200]  Everybody hates his guts.
[1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:38.800]  I mean, why can't we have a challenge in leadership and remove him?
[1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:40.680]  And who would be good to replace McCarthy?
[1:26:40.680 --> 1:26:44.120]  Well, I suspect we will have a challenge.
[1:26:44.120 --> 1:26:51.520]  But I hate to answer your question with a question, but will we have a free, fair, honest, transparent
[1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:52.520]  election?
[1:26:52.520 --> 1:26:54.520]  It's supposed to question that, it's terrorism too.
[1:26:54.520 --> 1:26:56.200]  But we don't know whether that's true or not.
[1:26:56.200 --> 1:26:57.200]  So I agree.
[1:26:57.200 --> 1:26:59.960]  That brings us to the next question going, two minutes, we got time here.
[1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:03.160]  Obviously, the Democrats aren't going to let us have a free election.
[1:27:03.160 --> 1:27:08.080]  They already stole the last, they want to outlaw questioning and election outcomes.
[1:27:08.080 --> 1:27:10.700]  What are you predicting for 2022?
[1:27:10.700 --> 1:27:14.120]  My prediction is pretty, it's pretty dire.
[1:27:14.120 --> 1:27:19.200]  I'm predicting a new pandemic of some kind that begins in September.
[1:27:19.200 --> 1:27:23.560]  They will then use that pandemic as an excuse for lockdowns.
[1:27:23.560 --> 1:27:28.400]  But more precisely, they will rush through legislation, which will be signed that says
[1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:33.640]  all voting has to be by mail, because it's too dangerous for folks to go to polling places.
[1:27:33.640 --> 1:27:37.800]  It's too dangerous for them to actually show up on one day and vote.
[1:27:37.800 --> 1:27:39.880]  Here's the tip off, Alex.
[1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:42.520]  I don't think anybody voted for Macron.
[1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:44.360]  I don't think this guy won the election.
[1:27:44.360 --> 1:27:48.440]  All the polls showed her winning massively, a lapin, and then he went.
[1:27:48.440 --> 1:27:49.440]  Yeah.
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:52.800]  So this has the, look, I don't have enough time to, I haven't had enough time to look
[1:27:52.800 --> 1:27:55.600]  into it, but it smells very bad.
[1:27:55.600 --> 1:27:59.720]  And therefore, folks who stole the previous election, why couldn't they steal a future
[1:27:59.720 --> 1:28:00.720]  election?
[1:28:00.720 --> 1:28:01.720]  They're emboldened.
[1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:03.720]  All they're going to do is lose power and go to president if they don't.
[1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:06.920]  They're going to steal the midterms or try.
[1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:12.720]  The funniest thing going on is this lockstep thing about Trump and the big lie.
[1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:15.840]  There is, there's no evidence of fraud, folks, none.
[1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:16.840]  Trump is crazy.
[1:28:16.840 --> 1:28:17.840]  It's a lie.
[1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:20.160]  The lie is that there's no evidence.
[1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:26.040]  There's overwhelming evidence of irregularities and anomalies and there, but the real point
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:30.600]  here is you can't say the election was stolen and you can't say it wasn't stolen because
[1:28:30.600 --> 1:28:36.120]  no court, no regulatory body, no legislature, no one's been willing to actually look at
[1:28:36.120 --> 1:28:37.120]  the evidence.
[1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:39.920]  We are reaching a historic crossroads right now.
[1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:41.840]  Alex Jones here live with Roger Stone.
[1:28:41.840 --> 1:28:46.840]  Everybody, you know, tune in now, recover critical intel, you won't get anywhere else.
[1:28:46.840 --> 1:28:51.560]  Remember, the globalists work around the clock to shut this broadcast down for a reason.
[1:28:51.560 --> 1:28:53.320]  So share it and spread it.
[1:28:53.320 --> 1:28:58.800]  It's a revolutionary act.
[1:28:58.800 --> 1:29:02.160]  We have over 100 designs of t-shirts that just sit there in our warehouse.
[1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:07.000]  We need to sell those shirts to fund the operation, but we'd already made some orders on future
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  shirts coming in.
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  But these are all limited editions.
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:12.080]  So once these new shirts come in, we're going to sell those and that's it.
[1:29:12.080 --> 1:29:16.320]  We'll have limited editions one at a time in the future and when they're gone, they're
[1:29:16.320 --> 1:29:17.320]  gone.
[1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:18.880]  Well, here's the new limited edition shirt.
[1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:21.320]  This one is $24.95, a really nice fabric.
[1:29:21.320 --> 1:29:26.320]  Alex Jones was right on the front with a big red lightning bolt on the back, infowars.com.
[1:29:26.320 --> 1:29:30.120]  You talk about triggering, you talk about spreading the word, you talk about waking people up.
[1:29:30.120 --> 1:29:31.360]  Alex Jones was right.
[1:29:31.360 --> 1:29:34.640]  Fundraiser shirt, we need the funds to operate.

[1:29:35.640 --> 1:29:36.640]  Alex Jones was right.
[1:29:36.640 --> 1:29:38.040]  It's a gorgeous shirt.
[1:29:38.040 --> 1:29:39.040]  We're really proud of it.

[1:30:28.200 --> 1:30:29.200]  shirt costs us.

[1:30:33.360 --> 1:30:35.520]  It costs $10, we're selling it for $10.

[1:32:00.760 --> 1:32:02.800]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[1:32:02.800 --> 1:32:03.800]  Welcome.
[1:32:03.800 --> 1:32:04.800]  Hello, Alex.
[1:32:04.800 --> 1:32:05.800]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:32:05.800 --> 1:32:06.800]  All right.
[1:32:06.800 --> 1:32:08.800]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[1:32:08.800 --> 1:32:13.680]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer, SuperMail
[1:32:13.680 --> 1:32:16.440]  Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[1:32:16.440 --> 1:32:17.440]  Mix those two together.
[1:32:17.440 --> 1:32:19.040]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[1:32:19.040 --> 1:32:21.040]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works.
[1:32:21.040 --> 1:32:26.680]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up, and so it
[1:32:26.680 --> 1:32:31.880]  has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well that just
[1:32:31.880 --> 1:32:32.880]  aren't as strong.
[1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:34.440]  This is like a very fine wine.
[1:32:34.440 --> 1:32:36.960]  In fact, each batch is different.
[1:32:36.960 --> 1:32:38.880]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[1:32:38.880 --> 1:32:42.080]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as
[1:32:42.080 --> 1:32:43.080]  strong?
[1:32:43.080 --> 1:32:44.080]  That's just how it is.
[1:32:44.080 --> 1:32:45.080]  It's how it works.
[1:32:45.080 --> 1:32:46.600]  So it's always good.
[1:32:46.600 --> 1:32:50.720]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong, but yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a
[1:32:50.720 --> 1:33:00.520]  decent price, then this is it.
[1:33:00.520 --> 1:33:23.280]  Reading of Frontal Assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:23.280 --> 1:33:30.280]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on your mind.
[1:33:30.280 --> 1:33:35.640]  All right, we can sit here and rearrange deck chairs with the Titanic all day, but the
[1:33:35.640 --> 1:33:40.280]  globalist worldwide and the politicians they control, Klaus Schwab and David Rockefeller's
[1:33:40.280 --> 1:33:47.760]  minions like Bill Gates Bragg about it, aren't going to let us take over peacefully and fix
[1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:48.760]  things.
[1:33:48.760 --> 1:33:50.280]  They don't want the will of the people to take place.
[1:33:50.280 --> 1:33:53.600]  Roger, I want to talk about Elon Musk, we think about him, Twitter.
[1:33:53.600 --> 1:33:58.080]  I want to get into so many big issues with you, but I cannot impress to listeners enough
[1:33:58.080 --> 1:34:00.880]  that we're not in normal political seasons here.
[1:34:00.880 --> 1:34:07.000]  We're in a global awakening and major populist realignment rejecting the corporate tyranny,
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:14.640]  rejecting the leftist CRT pedophile garbage, and they aren't going to back off without
[1:34:14.640 --> 1:34:16.680]  trying to declare us all terrorists.
[1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:20.240]  And I believe the next 197 days they're going to stage false flags to blame us, Roger.
[1:34:20.240 --> 1:34:23.600]  I want you to speak to the big picture, the great reset, all of it, and then let's get
[1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:26.200]  into Twitter battles and everything else is happening.
[1:34:26.200 --> 1:34:28.840]  Well, Twitter is actually key to this, Alex.
[1:34:28.840 --> 1:34:31.880]  I mean, Twitter is the is the head of the snake.
[1:34:31.880 --> 1:34:34.520]  Let me explain to you how media works today.
[1:34:34.520 --> 1:34:40.200]  Once an idea, regardless of how baseless, how false, how ridiculous, reaches like us
[1:34:40.200 --> 1:34:41.680]  commanding January 6th.
[1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:42.680]  Exactly.
[1:34:42.680 --> 1:34:45.320]  Once that reaches critical mass on Twitter.
[1:34:45.320 --> 1:34:51.520]  Then the 200 reporters in the headquarters of the New York Times and the Washington Post
[1:34:51.520 --> 1:34:57.040]  and the Wall Street Journal decide that it is a fact and they report it as a fact.
[1:34:57.040 --> 1:35:01.440]  Also those in government, particularly those who were corrupted in government, now decide
[1:35:01.440 --> 1:35:04.520]  that they have to prosecute that fact.
[1:35:04.520 --> 1:35:10.160]  So when Mueller's thugs stormed my home at six o'clock in the morning with 29 heavily
[1:35:10.160 --> 1:35:17.760]  armed FBI agents, you know, brandishing fully automatic M4 assault weapons, they actually
[1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:21.720]  believe that when they got my emails, when they got my text messages, when they looked
[1:35:21.720 --> 1:35:26.760]  at the text messages between Alex Jones and I, they were going to find Russian collusion.
[1:35:26.760 --> 1:35:30.840]  To their consternation, they couldn't find any of the things that Twitter told them
[1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:37.800]  were there, that the bloodlust filled fanatics on Twitter were absolutely certain would be
[1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:38.800]  found.
[1:35:38.800 --> 1:35:41.680]  That's why they had to fabricate charges against me.
[1:35:41.680 --> 1:35:46.480]  Twitter is absolutely, that's where they get their marching orders.
[1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:50.240]  That's where the deep state legions get their marching orders.
[1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:54.840]  Chop off the head of the snake and you completely disrupt their entire plan.
[1:35:54.840 --> 1:36:00.440]  That's why potentially Elon Musk is a savior.
[1:36:00.440 --> 1:36:04.360]  So here's what I think, he needs to fire everybody.
[1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:08.480]  Don't think that the globalists who work there now are going to take orders from the
[1:36:08.480 --> 1:36:11.040]  new boss because they're not.
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:15.240]  We've already seen, by the way, when he first announced that he was taking a stake, did
[1:36:15.240 --> 1:36:17.560]  you see the statement Alex from the management?
[1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:19.960]  They're saying, well, we don't care what he says.
[1:36:19.960 --> 1:36:23.800]  He can join the board if he wants, but the board doesn't make decisions here.
[1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:26.680]  But now, reportedly, he's taking it over today.
[1:36:26.680 --> 1:36:28.480]  Look, from your mouth to God's ears.
[1:36:28.480 --> 1:36:32.360]  But if that's true, let me tell you, it needs to be reinstated in their Twitter feed.
[1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:39.120]  Number one, Donald J. Trump, number two, Roger Stone, number three, Alex Jones.
[1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:40.120]  Let's keep on going.
[1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:46.800]  All those great patriots who once had millions of followers, millions of followers.
[1:36:46.800 --> 1:36:52.320]  I had 980,000 followers on Twitter at the time that I was decapitated.
[1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:57.560]  They still never told me, other than maybe hurting Jake Tapper's feelings, why I was
[1:36:57.560 --> 1:36:58.560]  axed.
[1:36:58.560 --> 1:36:59.560]  I still don't know.
[1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:01.480]  And they go, oh, how dare you beg to do that?
[1:37:01.480 --> 1:37:04.120]  That's where the open market of ideas are happening.
[1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:06.280]  It's the digital soapbox.
[1:37:06.280 --> 1:37:08.440]  And again, they say, oh, it's a private company.
[1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:09.440]  Do what it wants.
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:13.520]  Now, suddenly, no, it's a threat to freedom if Elon Musk takes over and lets us have free
[1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:14.520]  speech.
[1:37:14.520 --> 1:37:17.760]  One of the funniest things I saw last week was Robert Reich actually went to high school
[1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:18.920]  with this guy.
[1:37:18.920 --> 1:37:21.200]  He was the secretary of labor in the Clinton administration.
[1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:22.200]  The garden gnome.
[1:37:22.200 --> 1:37:23.200]  Yeah.
[1:37:23.200 --> 1:37:29.360]  This guy puts a post saying that Musk's commitment to free speech is the hallmark of every dictator
[1:37:29.360 --> 1:37:30.960]  and tyrant who's come down the pipe.
[1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:35.120]  They're not claiming he works for Putin, even though he's been fighting Putin in Ukraine.
[1:37:35.120 --> 1:37:36.480]  It's the exact opposite.
[1:37:36.480 --> 1:37:43.080]  If you look at Cuba, if you look at Venezuela, if you look at the Soviet Union, if you look
[1:37:43.080 --> 1:37:48.640]  at Nazi Germany, the hallmark of all those strong men is censorship.
[1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:51.480]  And they're saying stopping censorship is fascist.
[1:37:51.480 --> 1:37:52.480]  There's actual headlines.
[1:37:52.480 --> 1:37:55.080]  Elon Musk's stopping censorship is fascism.
[1:37:55.080 --> 1:37:56.280]  It's a threat to our democracy.
[1:37:56.280 --> 1:37:58.560]  Well, first of all, we're not even a democracy.
[1:37:58.560 --> 1:37:59.560]  We're a republic.
[1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:01.600]  They can't even get that part straight.
[1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:05.680]  I'm very excited about Elon, because he's come out against the population, he's come
[1:38:05.680 --> 1:38:09.440]  out against the poison vaccines, he's come out against the censorship.
[1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:11.040]  I mean, he's doing a lot of good stuff.
[1:38:11.040 --> 1:38:15.040]  Look, he's always been an advocate for the legalization of cannabis, something I strongly
[1:38:15.040 --> 1:38:17.760]  agree with and have for 30 years.
[1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:20.560]  I think the guy, I don't think he's a conservative.
[1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:21.680]  I think he's a libertarian.
[1:38:21.680 --> 1:38:23.960]  I think he's a free thinker.
[1:38:23.960 --> 1:38:27.640]  But I really hope that if he does take control, he will clean house.
[1:38:27.640 --> 1:38:33.000]  He has to clean house, because management has already said in the statement last week,
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:37.560]  which was extraordinarily arrogant, that they're not going to take new leadership even from
[1:38:37.560 --> 1:38:38.560]  a new owner.
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:41.680]  But then shareholders go, wait, we want double the stock price.
[1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:44.520]  I mean, again, they're saying, because it's a free company, right?
[1:38:44.520 --> 1:38:48.760]  Well, then it can do what it wants, and if it wants to give free speech back, well, again,
[1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:50.800]  the left is caught in a rock and a hard place here.
[1:38:50.800 --> 1:38:55.080]  I've never understood why someone didn't just buy Twitter stock and then sue in the
[1:38:55.080 --> 1:38:58.040]  Chancelley court over the devaluation of the stock.
[1:38:58.040 --> 1:38:59.960]  There's no 230 issues there.
[1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:05.120]  Now, that assumes that the Chancelley court in Delaware is honest, and I'm not sure about
[1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:06.120]  that.
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:12.400]  But the left is absolutely apoplectic that this guy is committed to free speech.
[1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:13.400]  I'll show some headlines.
[1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:14.400]  Report.
[1:39:14.400 --> 1:39:16.640]  Twitter and Elon Musk in final negotiations will take over bid.
[1:39:16.640 --> 1:39:18.080]  Deal could be reached today.
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:19.080]  Now that's confirmed.
[1:39:19.080 --> 1:39:24.240]  Elon Musk perched his straws near to let this melt down and hold a funeral for Twitter.
[1:39:24.240 --> 1:39:28.480]  Paul Armageddon approaches his Twitter deal with Elon Musk, reported to be imminent.
[1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:31.440]  I mean, they are crapping their little red diapers.
[1:39:31.440 --> 1:39:38.360]  Well, look, Twitter has become a sewer of hatred and bloodlust.
[1:39:38.360 --> 1:39:39.560]  There was a time when it was fun.
[1:39:39.560 --> 1:39:43.160]  There was a time when you could go in there and have actually vigorous and kind of funny
[1:39:43.160 --> 1:39:48.120]  and entertaining debate, and there was some, you know, there was some back and forth that
[1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:49.120]  was worthwhile.
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:52.040]  Today, it is just an ocean of hatred.
[1:39:52.040 --> 1:39:57.960]  I mean, when I refused to testify and decided to evoke my Fifth Amendment rights for the
[1:39:57.960 --> 1:40:03.120]  phony January 6th committee, there were people on there who were advocating the gang rape
[1:40:03.120 --> 1:40:06.920]  of my 73-year-old wife who's battling stage 4 cancer.
[1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:12.200]  Of course, they're not banned, but criticized and dictators aren't and former presidents
[1:40:12.200 --> 1:40:13.200]  are banned.
[1:40:13.200 --> 1:40:14.200]  And you know, that's the thing.
[1:40:14.200 --> 1:40:15.200]  I have a whole stack of news here.
[1:40:15.200 --> 1:40:16.840]  I'll talk about myself all day.
[1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:23.200]  But millions of retweets saying Alex Jones admits January 6th was an attack, Alex Jones
[1:40:23.200 --> 1:40:25.680]  called the FBI, he's going to rat everybody out.
[1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:29.680]  No, they keep calling us over and over again saying, I want to meet with you, I want to
[1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:35.160]  fly down with three agents and three prosecutors, and I said, fine, give me immunity.
[1:40:35.160 --> 1:40:39.560]  I have nothing to hide, but so you can't set me up in a perjury trap, full immunity.
[1:40:39.560 --> 1:40:41.000]  I will talk to you.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:46.080]  And then the New York Times puts it out that I'm coming out of the cold to expose January
[1:40:46.080 --> 1:40:47.080]  6th.
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:48.080]  Guess what?
[1:40:48.080 --> 1:40:49.080]  Now I'm talking to nobody.
[1:40:49.080 --> 1:40:51.040]  Alex Jones is not a fed.
[1:40:51.040 --> 1:40:54.080]  Alex Jones, and I know this for a fact because we were talking.
[1:40:54.080 --> 1:40:56.800]  Yeah, they said, we want to question you.
[1:40:56.800 --> 1:40:57.800]  We want to question you.
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:40:58.800]  I asked you advice a month ago.
[1:40:58.800 --> 1:41:01.680]  Yeah, and you asked for immunity, a perfectly legal thing, and of course they're not going
[1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:02.960]  to give you immunity.
[1:41:02.960 --> 1:41:04.160]  Which doesn't mean you're guilty.
[1:41:04.160 --> 1:41:05.680]  I'm not Martha Stewart.
[1:41:05.680 --> 1:41:08.080]  Like you said before, we went online on air.
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:09.560]  What kind of ham sandwich did you have?
[1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:10.560]  All you had a sandwich.
[1:41:10.560 --> 1:41:11.920]  Well, you didn't tell there was mustard.
[1:41:11.920 --> 1:41:17.280]  They can literally say even something non-consequential is a lie and then say I've lied to them.
[1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:21.720]  Or if someone else said something that contradicts me, they say that's a lie and prosecute me.
[1:41:21.720 --> 1:41:23.240]  Only a moron would talk to them.
[1:41:23.240 --> 1:41:27.960]  Yeah, so look, I have firsthand experience with their ability to take something you say
[1:41:27.960 --> 1:41:34.160]  that is immaterial, irrelevant, or innocuous and twist it into a crime.
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:35.360]  It's a process crime.
[1:41:35.360 --> 1:41:38.880]  That's the way they trap you, which is why I invoke my 5th Amendment right.
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:43.640]  It's not because I knew anything about January 6th and the so-called insurrection.
[1:41:43.640 --> 1:41:44.800]  Why the hell would we do that?
[1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:45.800]  That made us look horrible.
[1:41:45.800 --> 1:41:51.520]  Well, I had nothing to hide, but I understood their ability to twist your words into a crime,
[1:41:51.520 --> 1:41:54.880]  and therefore I invoked my constitutional right.
[1:41:54.880 --> 1:41:56.120]  That was my decision.
[1:41:56.120 --> 1:42:00.360]  Now, I think that just ignoring a subpoena would be stupid.
[1:42:00.360 --> 1:42:03.680]  In other words, I fulfilled my legal obligations under the subpoena.
[1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:04.680]  I did the same thing.
[1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:05.680]  Exactly.
[1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:08.920]  I did not to answer questions and invoke my 5th Amendment right.
[1:42:08.920 --> 1:42:14.360]  Why Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro and others have elected you just thumb their nose?
[1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:17.400]  That's not the legal advice that I followed.
[1:42:17.400 --> 1:42:20.040]  We're going to come back to the final segment.
[1:42:20.040 --> 1:42:24.200]  You're also going to be co-hosting the show you used to co-host as an employee of the
[1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:27.960]  War Room today, 3 to 6 p.m. and we're going to go to dinner this evening.
[1:42:27.960 --> 1:42:31.520]  But I mean, wow, what a time to be alive, Roger.
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:32.600]  This is an exciting time.
[1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:34.080]  I think we were born for this moment.
[1:42:34.080 --> 1:42:39.920]  Look, Alex, I honestly believe that the Lord spared my life for the battle ahead.
[1:42:39.920 --> 1:42:44.680]  And that's why it's important that Info Wars remain as strong and viable as possible.
[1:42:44.680 --> 1:42:46.800]  And by the way, you really are born again, and that's real.
[1:42:46.800 --> 1:42:47.800]  I've experienced it.
[1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:48.800]  I've seen it.
[1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:51.720]  And so Roger is a Boy Scout now, and that's a good thing.
[1:42:51.720 --> 1:42:52.720]  We'll be right back.
[1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:58.760]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:00.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[1:43:00.680 --> 1:43:04.120]  I need your help keeping InfoWars on the air and strong.
[1:43:04.120 --> 1:43:08.160]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:09.320]  I was born for this.
[1:43:09.320 --> 1:43:10.320]  You were born for this.
[1:43:10.320 --> 1:43:15.160]  And people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our own infrastructure
[1:43:15.160 --> 1:43:19.520]  because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:24.200]  And now, with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:30.120]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[1:43:30.120 --> 1:43:31.120]  of charge.
[1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:35.880]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[1:43:35.880 --> 1:43:40.360]  InfoWars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[1:43:40.360 --> 1:43:41.360]  movement worldwide.
[1:43:41.360 --> 1:43:47.040]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[1:43:47.040 --> 1:43:48.440]  of thousands of dollars a month.
[1:43:48.440 --> 1:43:52.760]  So the biggest sale in InfoWars history is going right now, the mega-emergency blowout
[1:43:52.760 --> 1:43:58.520]  sale up to 75% off, getting credible products and keeping InfoWars as strong as ever.
[1:43:58.520 --> 1:44:03.360]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[1:44:03.360 --> 1:44:05.720]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[1:44:05.720 --> 1:44:10.280]  I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[1:44:10.280 --> 1:44:14.840]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[1:44:14.840 --> 1:44:18.200]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with F2, you had, you know, with a deep-burdened
[1:44:18.200 --> 1:44:20.880]  source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[1:44:20.880 --> 1:44:27.200]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[1:44:27.200 --> 1:44:31.920]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again, and over the course of
[1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:36.200]  the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your
[1:44:36.200 --> 1:44:37.200]  supplements.
[1:44:37.200 --> 1:44:39.200]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[1:44:39.200 --> 1:44:43.360]  The one I like recently is Knockout, literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:44.360]  It's amazing.
[1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:45.360]  It works.
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:48.520]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[1:44:48.520 --> 1:44:52.520]  the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our
[1:44:52.520 --> 1:44:53.520]  own hands.
[1:44:53.520 --> 1:44:58.880]  As we said, brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[1:44:58.880 --> 1:45:04.280]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[1:45:04.280 --> 1:45:06.320]  a healthier life.
[1:45:06.320 --> 1:45:10.160]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system of a supplement
[1:45:10.160 --> 1:45:11.800]  that contains both.
[1:45:11.800 --> 1:45:16.760]  This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[1:45:16.760 --> 1:45:18.360]  from the InfoWars store.
[1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:23.200]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[1:45:23.200 --> 1:45:25.920]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:45:25.920 --> 1:45:30.800]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[1:45:30.800 --> 1:45:35.440]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[1:45:35.440 --> 1:45:36.440]  shown.
[1:45:36.440 --> 1:45:40.720]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[1:45:40.720 --> 1:45:45.320]  role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:45:45.320 --> 1:45:50.440]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:51.440]  like here in America.
[1:45:51.440 --> 1:45:56.240]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:45:58.360]  our rose hips don't lie.

[1:46:18.440 --> 1:46:22.840]  activity they're involved in, it is more important than ever to take the tools God gave us and
[1:46:22.840 --> 1:46:25.080]  supercharge our immune systems.

[1:46:59.960 --> 1:47:17.920]  Including a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:32.000]  I'm not going to give you the inside baseball, but I told you over a year ago that I was
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  told Elon Musk was going to go all out against the New World Order by a very well known individual,
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:35.760]  and then I was told that by some other people only, but then I had some meetings with some
[1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:39.960]  other people that are very well known, billionaires, and they said, listen, we don't like what's
[1:47:39.960 --> 1:47:42.400]  happening, we know you're right, we want to find it.
[1:47:42.400 --> 1:47:45.160]  We don't want to collapse civilization and society, so when I did that a whole first
[1:47:45.160 --> 1:47:50.960]  hour today, that's probably the most important hour I've ever done, you need to understand
[1:47:50.960 --> 1:47:57.560]  that all this other stuff is important, but it's symptoms of the disease of the globalist.
[1:47:57.560 --> 1:48:01.720]  And Roger Stone's here with us, we got Robert Barnes coming up next hour, he was on fire
[1:48:01.720 --> 1:48:05.200]  with me Friday, Roger's going to ride shotgun for part of that, he'll be on the war room
[1:48:05.200 --> 1:48:10.520]  as well today, but I just want you to realize that I'm not trying to set up here and say
[1:48:10.520 --> 1:48:16.120]  I'm a revolutionary leader and I'm an important person, the globalists see me as that and
[1:48:16.120 --> 1:48:21.880]  they see Donald Trump and Roger Stone and a few others as that, so we are your champions,
[1:48:21.880 --> 1:48:27.160]  you are our champions that keep us to the fight, but when I tell you that this is big
[1:48:27.160 --> 1:48:31.640]  leagues and we're taking them on at point blank range and we don't back down, that's
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:35.480]  why they run stories saying, oh, we're backing down, we're coming into them because they
[1:48:35.480 --> 1:48:40.200]  know our power is that we haven't back down, so I'm asking you and I want to thank all
[1:48:40.200 --> 1:48:45.280]  the people that made donations at infowarstore.com, right there at the top it says be a sponsor,
[1:48:45.280 --> 1:48:50.640]  make a donation, I want to thank you and salute you, you are 1776 2.0, I want to encourage
[1:48:50.640 --> 1:48:55.520]  your body to get t-shirts, books, films, Alex Jones is right, you name it at infowarstore.com
[1:48:55.520 --> 1:49:01.160]  and X2, Deepworth, Crystal iodine, pure atomic iodine, people say they have atomic iodine,
[1:49:01.160 --> 1:49:07.320]  they don't, we're the only folks that have it, it's back in stock, it's 25% off infowarstore.com
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:12.640]  or AAA-253-3139 and I want to thank you all for your support, it's historic and I thank
[1:49:12.640 --> 1:49:19.880]  you for keeping us in the fight, Roger there's so much to hit, there's so much to cover
[1:49:19.880 --> 1:49:22.960]  and it's so great to have you here, I'm trying to talk you into stand tomorrow, maybe you
[1:49:22.960 --> 1:49:28.760]  can co-host the whole show with me, but on our radar, what else is key to you, what else
[1:49:28.760 --> 1:49:30.560]  do you want to impart to the viewers and listeners?
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:35.400]  Well, first of all Alex, I need to correct you on one thing, it was exactly 16 months
[1:49:35.400 --> 1:49:40.480]  ago you told me that you had heard from reliable sources that Elon Musk was going to ride to
[1:49:40.480 --> 1:49:41.480]  the rescue.
[1:49:41.480 --> 1:49:46.400]  I saved the email, I checked it this morning, you predicted this, I was skeptical, I said
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:48.400]  Alex I don't know, I don't think the guys could see it.
[1:49:48.400 --> 1:49:49.400]  I remember the conversation.
[1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:55.800]  Yeah, so there's no question, it was about 16 months ago, almost exactly, you said this
[1:49:55.800 --> 1:50:01.240]  and you turn out to be right, he's now made Twitter an offer they can't refuse, this is
[1:50:01.240 --> 1:50:03.000]  chopping off the head of the beast.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:09.080]  Right now, the people in the New York Times newsroom are on Suicide Watch even as we speak,
[1:50:09.080 --> 1:50:13.560]  because this is their network, once something reaches critical mass there, the next day you
[1:50:13.560 --> 1:50:15.800]  see it on the front page of the New York Times.
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:19.120]  You just reminded me of that, because it's not name dropping, Elon had moved here, I'm
[1:50:19.120 --> 1:50:23.640]  not going to get into the insides of it, I missed out twice being invited, I'm going
[1:50:23.640 --> 1:50:28.520]  to leave it at that, I was always out of town bad luck when it happened, but I mean they're
[1:50:28.520 --> 1:50:33.960]  very high level people told me this was going to happen and it did, and I was also told
[1:50:33.960 --> 1:50:41.440]  that the war was coming in February from a certain person, so I mean there's no doubt
[1:50:41.440 --> 1:50:43.360]  this is happening.
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:47.960]  And the great reset, as Tucker Carlson says, these people don't act like they've got the
[1:50:47.960 --> 1:50:52.480]  luxury of time, they act like people who are in a hurry because they know the American
[1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:53.800]  people aren't going to put up with this.
[1:50:53.800 --> 1:50:59.640]  As you said, it's now confirmed in federal court that Chinese spies and others met with
[1:50:59.640 --> 1:51:06.840]  Hunter Biden and Joe Biden when he was vice president six years ago, and so it's all confirmed
[1:51:06.840 --> 1:51:08.320]  now, I mean this is treason.
[1:51:08.320 --> 1:51:12.960]  But let's be very clear, the people who told us that the Russian intelligence helped elect
[1:51:12.960 --> 1:51:17.760]  Donald Trump, the people who told us that Hillary Clinton did not spy on Donald Trump,
[1:51:17.760 --> 1:51:23.160]  the people who told us that the COVID-19 vaccinations were both safe and effective, the people who
[1:51:23.160 --> 1:51:30.280]  told us that Hunter Biden's laptop was Russian disinformation, now try to tell us that the
[1:51:30.280 --> 1:51:39.160]  war in Ukraine is about the Russian's expansionist desire to restore the fated glory of the
[1:51:39.160 --> 1:51:40.160]  also the idiot.
[1:51:40.160 --> 1:51:44.680]  When they're holding George Soros takeover back, I'm not endorsing the war, it's just
[1:51:44.680 --> 1:51:47.440]  they bragged, they overthrew the government eight years ago, they've been attacking the
[1:51:47.440 --> 1:51:48.440]  Russian border.
[1:51:48.440 --> 1:51:49.440]  I mean.
[1:51:49.440 --> 1:51:50.440]  Max Blumenthal.
[1:51:50.440 --> 1:51:55.560]  The former US ambassador said, yeah, Trump would have stopped the war, but we wanted
[1:51:55.560 --> 1:51:56.560]  one.
[1:51:56.560 --> 1:52:01.800]  Max Blumenthal, who is a leftist, probably even a communist, but who has rightly said
[1:52:01.800 --> 1:52:08.720]  that we've already built the silos to drop in the offensive weapons that we have been,
[1:52:08.720 --> 1:52:14.520]  we the West have been provocative and that Putin is acting defensively.
[1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:18.920]  He doesn't want Russian missiles, pardon me, he doesn't want NATO missiles pointed at
[1:52:18.920 --> 1:52:19.920]  his country.
[1:52:19.920 --> 1:52:24.960]  He doesn't want bio weapons labs funded by US taxpayers cooking up.
[1:52:24.960 --> 1:52:26.080]  God knows what.
[1:52:26.080 --> 1:52:33.040]  And if you say that, then Bill O'Reilly attacks you as a Putin stooge, a Russian agent.
[1:52:33.040 --> 1:52:39.600]  No, my family members were mowed down by Russian tanks in Budapest in 1956.
[1:52:39.600 --> 1:52:43.920]  But if you're Alex Jones or you're Tucker Carlson or you're Roger Stone, and you tell
[1:52:43.920 --> 1:52:49.400]  the truth about what's really happening in Ukraine, that Zelensky is an actor, an actor
[1:52:49.400 --> 1:52:53.080]  with a multi-million dollar condominium in Miami Beach, by the way.
[1:52:53.080 --> 1:52:56.560]  And we're not against him that he was a gay porn star, it's just the fact they bribed
[1:52:56.560 --> 1:52:57.560]  him with that.
[1:52:57.560 --> 1:52:58.560]  They blackmail him.
[1:52:58.560 --> 1:53:01.880]  He's an actor, he's playing the role of a president.
[1:53:01.880 --> 1:53:07.200]  This war is not about what they say it's about, no, I'm not a traitor, no, I don't love Putin,
[1:53:07.200 --> 1:53:09.200]  no, I don't like the authoritarian system.
[1:53:09.200 --> 1:53:10.200]  So how do you see it ending?
[1:53:10.200 --> 1:53:14.200]  The left is desperate, they're losing control worldwide, the globalists resets in trouble,
[1:53:14.200 --> 1:53:15.920]  what are they going to do?
[1:53:15.920 --> 1:53:20.200]  I think, I still see a pandemic to preserve their power.
[1:53:20.200 --> 1:53:23.240]  They're going to bring back a pandemic, and what about power outages?
[1:53:23.240 --> 1:53:26.880]  They're saying cyber attacks from Russia, but they admit it's the CIA put the chips
[1:53:26.880 --> 1:53:27.880]  in.
[1:53:27.880 --> 1:53:32.320]  Well, not only that, but as Tucker Carlson has revealed, why this, why this spate of
[1:53:32.320 --> 1:53:35.040]  problems at food processing plants?
[1:53:35.040 --> 1:53:36.040]  They intend to start.
[1:53:36.040 --> 1:53:37.040]  Well, they're 40 blown up now.
[1:53:37.040 --> 1:53:38.040]  Right.
[1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:39.040]  Not 20.
[1:53:39.040 --> 1:53:40.040]  Right.
[1:53:40.040 --> 1:53:41.040]  So they intend to starve the American people into submission.
[1:53:41.040 --> 1:53:43.240]  No, it's not a conspiracy theory.
[1:53:43.240 --> 1:53:45.560]  They're collapsing the border, they're devaluing the dollar.
[1:53:45.560 --> 1:53:46.560]  They're destroying the food processing.
[1:53:46.560 --> 1:53:48.200]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[1:53:48.200 --> 1:53:53.960]  And I think they're going to put a state run currency where the bank, where a central
[1:53:53.960 --> 1:53:55.440]  bank controls all money.
[1:53:55.440 --> 1:53:56.440]  Exactly.
[1:53:56.440 --> 1:53:59.200]  What do you make of the head of the IMF saying the world economy is going to collapse, all
[1:53:59.200 --> 1:54:03.440]  the banks are insolvent, governments are insolvent, sorry, it's a mistake, but don't
[1:54:03.440 --> 1:54:05.840]  worry, we've got a new digital currency for you.
[1:54:05.840 --> 1:54:07.680]  She says this, we played the clip last hour.
[1:54:07.680 --> 1:54:08.680]  Yeah.
[1:54:08.680 --> 1:54:09.680]  So here's how this is going to work.
[1:54:09.680 --> 1:54:12.960]  If you're politically incorrect, you can't get any of your own money.
[1:54:12.960 --> 1:54:14.560]  You can't go to the grocery store.
[1:54:14.560 --> 1:54:17.800]  Well, Italy says that with the new social credit score.
[1:54:17.800 --> 1:54:22.320]  They say you submit your money's worth something if it is and it's not.
[1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:24.800]  They've already put this in place in all places.
[1:54:24.800 --> 1:54:25.800]  Ukraine.
[1:54:25.800 --> 1:54:28.120]  Ukraine has made all these reforms.
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:32.480]  So they want to control your ability to get ghastly if you could even afford it.
[1:54:32.480 --> 1:54:36.600]  But you won't be able to buy it because you're not approved to buy it, nor will you be able
[1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:39.680]  to get groceries or the fundamentals of life.
[1:54:39.680 --> 1:54:42.760]  This is an incredible time where it's all happening.
[1:54:42.760 --> 1:54:45.000]  Only old timers warned us of, we're here.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:48.040]  Well, you were the Paul Revere of this.
[1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:53.800]  I mean, trying to shut down infowars is like trying to snuff Paul Revere.
[1:54:53.800 --> 1:54:56.160]  You heard it here first and what did they say?
[1:54:56.160 --> 1:55:01.680]  Your conspiracy theorists, no, were conspiracy realists, virtually everything we said.
[1:55:01.680 --> 1:55:09.240]  I came on this show and I talked about Jeffrey Epstein three, four years ago before anybody
[1:55:09.240 --> 1:55:12.960]  in the mainstream, it's all in my book, The Clinton's War on Women.
[1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:18.400]  It was written in 2015, six years ago, when I first reported on it.
[1:55:18.400 --> 1:55:22.120]  And now you realize the entire story turns out to be true.
[1:55:22.120 --> 1:55:25.480]  This guy was blackmailing everybody and his brother.
[1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:30.000]  He was essentially a mercenary, working for the Israelis, working for the Saudis, working
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:31.240]  for the Americans.
[1:55:31.240 --> 1:55:33.920]  And no, I don't believe he killed himself.
[1:55:33.920 --> 1:55:39.640]  And people went and had sex with underage girls on purpose to be inducted into the cult,
[1:55:39.640 --> 1:55:41.160]  into the blackmail.
[1:55:41.160 --> 1:55:45.760]  Or some did it, not realizing that they were being videoed, and it would later be used
[1:55:45.760 --> 1:55:47.160]  against them.
[1:55:47.160 --> 1:55:48.360]  Absolutely.
[1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:49.920]  This is an incredible moment.
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:53.040]  What would you call this point in history, Rodgers, Tom?
[1:55:53.040 --> 1:55:54.480]  Well, they call it the Great Result.
[1:55:54.480 --> 1:55:56.640]  I call it the Second American Revolution.
[1:55:56.640 --> 1:55:59.120]  I mean, I still think that we are a majority.
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:00.960]  I know that we are a majority.
[1:56:00.960 --> 1:56:07.240]  So when I go out in public, even in downtown Austin, there's still a plurality of patriotic
[1:56:07.240 --> 1:56:11.880]  who's furtively give me the thumbs up or pat me on the back or tell me that they're praying
[1:56:11.880 --> 1:56:13.160]  for me.
[1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:14.320]  We are still a majority.
[1:56:14.320 --> 1:56:16.240]  They want to suppress that majority.
[1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:20.320]  Unfortunately, the minority is both vocal and they're violent.
[1:56:20.320 --> 1:56:21.760]  We're not the violent ones.
[1:56:21.760 --> 1:56:22.760]  They're the violent ones.
[1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:27.800]  If I saw Speaker Nasty Piglosi eating in a restaurant, I wouldn't go up to your table
[1:56:27.800 --> 1:56:28.800]  and start screaming.
[1:56:28.800 --> 1:56:30.160]  I wouldn't physically threaten her.
[1:56:30.160 --> 1:56:34.320]  I'd ignore her, but that's not how the left thinks.
[1:56:34.320 --> 1:56:36.160]  They're the ones who are intolerant.
[1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:37.840]  They're the ones who are dangerous.
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:40.040]  They're the ones who use violence.
[1:56:40.040 --> 1:56:44.640]  Intifa and Black Lives Matter burned down half the country, did millions of dollars
[1:56:44.640 --> 1:56:50.480]  of damage to public and private property, killed people, injured people, and yet no
[1:56:50.480 --> 1:56:53.160]  one, no one has been prosecuted.
[1:56:53.160 --> 1:56:55.160]  We're going to go to break here.
[1:56:55.160 --> 1:56:58.440]  We're going to do five more minutes with us and you're going to stay with us for our
[1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:00.320]  farms, actually, so that's good.
[1:57:00.320 --> 1:57:03.920]  And then you're going to be on the war room today, Roger Stone is on fire, Roger, wear
[1:57:03.920 --> 1:57:08.800]  your websites, have people find your verboten programs, and this great new Frank Speech thing.
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:11.000]  He's so great.
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:14.280]  People bitch at Lindell for saying we turned the election over in a few months.
[1:57:14.280 --> 1:57:16.080]  He was being an optimist.
[1:57:16.080 --> 1:57:19.280]  The point is, he's built a whole new network and it's beautiful.
[1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:24.280]  Frankspeech.com, you can go see the Stone Zone every day, four o'clock central, five
[1:57:24.280 --> 1:57:25.280]  o'clock Eastern.
[1:57:25.280 --> 1:57:26.680]  You're going to be shooting live here today?
[1:57:26.680 --> 1:57:27.680]  Yes, we're going to shoot it out here.
[1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:28.680]  Yep.
[1:57:28.680 --> 1:57:29.680]  All right.
[1:57:29.680 --> 1:57:30.680]  We love it.
[1:57:30.680 --> 1:57:34.840]  And we're not in competition with OAN or Frankspeech or anybody, folks, we're in competition
[1:57:34.840 --> 1:57:37.400]  with Tyrants and we love it.
[1:57:37.400 --> 1:57:38.400]  Infowars.com.
[1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:39.400]  Tomorrow's news today.
[1:57:39.400 --> 1:57:42.040]  I want to thank the Lizards for keeping us in the fight.
[1:57:42.040 --> 1:57:48.760]  Our number three, straight ahead with Robert Barnes and Roger Stone.
[1:57:48.760 --> 1:57:55.800]  Over the years, Infowars has produced more than 200 amazing patriot Americana, Second
[1:57:55.800 --> 1:58:01.200]  Amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts, ball caps, flags, you name it.
[1:58:01.200 --> 1:58:05.040]  All of the apparel and the flags are being sold at cost right now.
[1:58:05.040 --> 1:58:07.680]  That's just regular plain-chain shirts.
[1:58:07.680 --> 1:58:13.240]  That is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[1:58:13.240 --> 1:58:17.120]  We used to sell for $40, we're selling them for $15, selling them for $20, whatever the
[1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:18.120]  shirt costs us.
[1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:22.280]  If a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5 for us to actually produce.
[1:58:22.280 --> 1:58:26.600]  If it costs $10, we're selling it for $10 and we've got hoodies and we've got long sleeves
[1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:30.280]  and we've got short sleeves, we've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all and
[1:58:30.280 --> 1:58:35.360]  they're limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs again.
[1:58:35.360 --> 1:58:39.480]  We are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in
[1:58:39.480 --> 1:58:40.480]  the future.
[1:58:40.480 --> 1:58:43.960]  We've got to sell this to keep Infowars on the air plus it spreads the word.
[1:58:43.960 --> 1:58:48.680]  Infowars.com, here historic apparel now, Infowars.com.
[1:58:48.680 --> 1:58:57.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, Infowars.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[1:58:57.600 --> 1:59:02.480]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[1:59:02.480 --> 1:59:08.400]  have broken down and Infowars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for
[1:59:08.400 --> 1:59:13.320]  operations and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making
[1:59:13.320 --> 1:59:14.320]  their main move.
[1:59:14.320 --> 1:59:18.600]  Infowars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people than
[1:59:18.600 --> 1:59:23.200]  ever despite the censorship but because of cost increasing and having to run our own
[1:59:23.200 --> 1:59:28.000]  infrastructure, pay for our own bandwidth, everything else, we are running out of money.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:34.640]  So listen, up to 75% off at infowarsstore.com on things like amazing Patriot t-shirts that
[1:59:34.640 --> 1:59:37.320]  help spread the word and fund the operation.
[1:59:37.320 --> 1:59:43.040]  On supplements, on books, on films, everything is 25 to 75% off right now.
[1:59:43.040 --> 1:59:46.440]  The biggest sell in our history at infowarsstore.com.
[1:59:46.440 --> 1:59:50.040]  Thank you for your support.
[1:59:50.040 --> 2:00:03.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:03.640 --> 2:00:11.480]  Roger Stone in studio and Robert Barnes coming up, ladies and gentlemen, riding shotgun with
[2:00:11.480 --> 2:00:12.480]  us.
[2:00:12.480 --> 2:00:13.480]  He's always been amazing.
[2:00:13.480 --> 2:00:16.200]  He blew me away Friday with Super Viral.
[2:00:16.200 --> 2:00:20.360]  He's got real analysis on what's going down.
[2:00:20.360 --> 2:00:27.400]  But let's talk about a company that Roger Stone told me about a few months ago and I researched.
[2:00:27.400 --> 2:00:31.480]  I talked to a lot of high-level IT people and folks and they said Volta Wireless is
[2:00:31.480 --> 2:00:32.480]  the way to go.
[2:00:32.480 --> 2:00:36.560]  They de-platformed, attacked for what they did but they're still a sponsor.
[2:00:36.560 --> 2:00:38.400]  They're a sponsor of Roger as well.
[2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:42.240]  It's a simple SIM card or a download where your phone has triple encryption, nobody can
[2:00:42.240 --> 2:00:43.240]  break it.
[2:00:43.240 --> 2:00:47.280]  This is the real deal and they have gotten more customer service today because they were
[2:00:47.280 --> 2:00:48.280]  in beta.
[2:00:48.280 --> 2:00:49.280]  They've gone operational.
[2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:50.280]  We'll put it on screen.
[2:00:50.280 --> 2:00:55.280]  You go to Volta Wireless and you put in Alex as the promo code and you get a big discount
[2:00:55.280 --> 2:01:00.560]  either on a phone or the SIM card or whatever it is you want, VoltaWireless.com and use
[2:01:00.560 --> 2:01:02.040]  promo code, Alex.
[2:01:02.040 --> 2:01:03.640]  Roger, tell us about Volta Wireless.
[2:01:03.640 --> 2:01:06.200]  I'll tell you what brought me to Volta Wireless.
[2:01:06.200 --> 2:01:10.720]  I found out that I was spied on on the front page of the New York Times.
[2:01:10.720 --> 2:01:16.840]  On the very day that Donald Trump was elected president or I should say sworn in, inauguration
[2:01:16.840 --> 2:01:23.800]  day, above the fold, I learned that I was one of three Trump associates who was being
[2:01:23.800 --> 2:01:24.800]  spied on.
[2:01:24.800 --> 2:01:29.320]  Therefore, to this day, I have a deep concern about whether my text messages, whether my
[2:01:29.320 --> 2:01:31.960]  cell phone calls are being monitored.
[2:01:31.960 --> 2:01:36.960]  This is what led me to look into alternative technologies and I can't tell you how happy
[2:01:36.960 --> 2:01:40.280]  I am with Volta Wireless.
[2:01:40.280 --> 2:01:43.800]  These guys are technologically way ahead of the curve.
[2:01:43.800 --> 2:01:45.160]  I recommended them to Alex.
[2:01:45.160 --> 2:01:46.880]  I know Alex is happy with them.
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:50.520]  You can use promo code, Alex, and sign up.
[2:01:50.520 --> 2:01:55.360]  These guys are top notch and if you're a conservative or a libertarian or just a free
[2:01:55.360 --> 2:01:59.800]  thinker and you're worried about big brother, look into your life and you learned about
[2:01:59.800 --> 2:02:00.800]  them at the CPAC.
[2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:01.800]  I did.
[2:02:01.800 --> 2:02:02.800]  And I was impressed.
[2:02:02.800 --> 2:02:04.640]  I sat for a presentation.
[2:02:04.640 --> 2:02:07.160]  I was prepared to think this was another freedom phone.
[2:02:07.160 --> 2:02:08.600]  Frankly, I didn't buy it.
[2:02:08.600 --> 2:02:09.600]  I didn't buy it.
[2:02:09.600 --> 2:02:14.080]  And the more I looked at it and the more study I did and I read a couple great articles
[2:02:14.080 --> 2:02:16.280]  about it, I recommended it to you.
[2:02:16.280 --> 2:02:18.240]  I recommend it to you, folks.
[2:02:18.240 --> 2:02:23.120]  Use promo code, Alex, and I'm telling you, you will be happy and you can sleep at night
[2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:28.080]  knowing that big brother or the media or the government is not snooping on your kind of
[2:02:28.080 --> 2:02:29.080] ...
[2:02:29.080 --> 2:02:30.080]  Nobody can break triple encryption at this level.
[2:02:30.080 --> 2:02:31.080]  That's what I'm told.
[2:02:31.080 --> 2:02:33.040]  And it's not like you're bad.
[2:02:33.040 --> 2:02:34.640]  You lock your door at night.
[2:02:34.640 --> 2:02:35.640]  You wear clothes.
[2:02:35.640 --> 2:02:37.880]  It's not that you're ashamed of yourself.
[2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:39.200]  You just protect yourself.
[2:02:39.200 --> 2:02:42.840]  You put shields up just to give us added defense.
[2:02:42.840 --> 2:02:43.840]  It's not that...
[2:02:43.840 --> 2:02:46.680]  When a police officer wears body armor, he's not bad.
[2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:47.960]  He's doing it because there's bad people.
[2:02:47.960 --> 2:02:51.120]  Well, not only that, but I've learned firsthand... I have nothing to hide.
[2:02:51.120 --> 2:02:55.560]  I've done nothing wrong, but they will take innocuous things that you say and then they
[2:02:55.560 --> 2:02:56.560]  will twist them.
[2:02:56.560 --> 2:02:58.320]  They'll take them out of context.
[2:02:58.320 --> 2:03:04.080]  So Stone said that he was going to steal this guy's dog and that was witness tampering.
[2:03:04.080 --> 2:03:05.080]  No.
[2:03:05.080 --> 2:03:06.080]  The dog wasn't being fed.
[2:03:06.080 --> 2:03:11.480]  I threatened to turn him over to the ASPCA, but if you take those messages out of context,
[2:03:11.480 --> 2:03:14.280]  it would appear that I threatened to kidnap somebody's dog.
[2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:15.280]  Ridiculous.
[2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:19.320]  Yet when that guy threatened to shoot a witness in the head who was going to the grand jury,
[2:03:19.320 --> 2:03:20.960]  he's not indicted by Robert Mueller.
[2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:22.960]  So protect yourself, folks.
[2:03:22.960 --> 2:03:27.680]  This way, your text messages, your cell phone calls, they can't be taken out of context by
[2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:29.160]  some big brother agency.
[2:03:29.160 --> 2:03:32.440]  They're vultualarlists.com, promo code Alex.
[2:03:32.440 --> 2:03:33.440]  It's amazing.
[2:03:33.440 --> 2:03:34.440]  And they're a great sponsor.
[2:03:34.440 --> 2:03:35.440]  They're supporting you.
[2:03:35.440 --> 2:03:36.440]  I love it.
[2:03:36.440 --> 2:03:38.520]  You know, Alex, I've had it up to here with lawyers.
[2:03:38.520 --> 2:03:40.080]  I hate lawyers.
[2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:44.880]  Finding a tough lawyer, finding a smart lawyer, finding a lawyer willing to fight is like
[2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:45.880]  a needle in a haystack.
[2:03:45.880 --> 2:03:47.200]  It doesn't exist.
[2:03:47.200 --> 2:03:51.200]  Robert Barnes is one of the few lawyers in America that I deeply respect.
[2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:54.000]  Not only is he a legal genius, but he's a fighter.
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:55.680]  He's got incredible guts.
[2:03:55.680 --> 2:03:56.680]  Every time I've asked for advice.
[2:03:56.680 --> 2:03:58.000]  A smartest tell, just like you.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:02.040]  I mean, I can count on a hand, the smartest one I know, you guys are on the hand.
[2:04:02.040 --> 2:04:03.040]  Well, but he's also courageous.
[2:04:03.040 --> 2:04:05.680]  You see, a lot of lawyers just don't have the belly for the fight.
[2:04:05.680 --> 2:04:08.160]  They're worried about, well, what's the judge going to think of me?
[2:04:08.160 --> 2:04:11.040]  Or what about, what if I have a different client up in front of this judge?
[2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:12.040]  And so just go with the truth.
[2:04:12.040 --> 2:04:13.040]  Right.
[2:04:13.040 --> 2:04:16.280]  So finding a good lawyer is virtually impossible.
[2:04:16.280 --> 2:04:17.960]  They always want to settle.
[2:04:17.960 --> 2:04:20.880]  They never want to confront the corruption.
[2:04:20.880 --> 2:04:24.760]  I have a tax case going on right now with the Department of Justice.
[2:04:24.760 --> 2:04:28.800]  They claim that I, they don't claim that I've hidden income or hidden assets or underreported
[2:04:28.800 --> 2:04:30.120]  income because I haven't.
[2:04:30.120 --> 2:04:31.720]  They just imply it.
[2:04:31.720 --> 2:04:35.640]  They press, they're, they're, they're, they're charges, which are in a civil action, read
[2:04:35.640 --> 2:04:37.520]  like a press release.
[2:04:37.520 --> 2:04:38.960]  They lie about everything.
[2:04:38.960 --> 2:04:42.360]  I want to, I want to raise that the lawyers of course want to settle.
[2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:46.960]  But the good news is people now know the corporate media is their enemy, as Trump said.
[2:04:46.960 --> 2:04:51.200]  The mainstream media is the enemy of the American people, Roger Stone and Robert Barnes coming
[2:04:51.200 --> 2:04:57.760]  up in T minus 60 seconds in full wars.com.
[2:04:57.760 --> 2:05:01.160]  We have over a hundred designs and T shirts that just sit there in our warehouse.
[2:05:01.160 --> 2:05:06.000]  We need to sell those shirts to fund the operation, but we'd already made some orders on future
[2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:07.000]  shirts coming in.
[2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:08.000]  But these are all limited editions.
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:11.040]  So once these new shirts come in, we're going to sell those and that's it.
[2:05:11.040 --> 2:05:15.280]  We'll have limited editions one at a time in the future and when they're gone, they're
[2:05:15.280 --> 2:05:16.280]  gone.
[2:05:16.280 --> 2:05:17.800]  Well, here's the new limited edition shirt.
[2:05:17.800 --> 2:05:20.520]  This one is $24.95, a really nice fabric.
[2:05:20.520 --> 2:05:25.120]  Alex Jones was right on the front with a big red lightning bolt on the back info wars.com.
[2:05:25.120 --> 2:05:29.040]  You talk about triggering, you talk about spreading the word, you talk about waking people up.
[2:05:29.040 --> 2:05:34.600]  Alex Jones was right fundraiser shirt, we need the funds to operate info wars store.com.
[2:05:34.600 --> 2:05:35.800]  Alex Jones was right.
[2:05:35.800 --> 2:05:37.000]  It's a gorgeous shirt.
[2:05:37.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  We're really proud of it.

[2:06:05.760 --> 2:06:09.280]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[2:06:09.280 --> 2:06:11.280]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:11.280 --> 2:06:15.440]  No doubt we're the tip of the spear.
[2:06:15.440 --> 2:06:20.680]  There's no doubt we are in the dangerous zone because of you, the listeners that care and
[2:06:20.680 --> 2:06:27.880]  stand for us and stand behind us and because we are educated informed and tenacious.
[2:06:27.880 --> 2:06:28.880]  Amazing in this trifecta.
[2:06:28.880 --> 2:06:29.880]  You got Alex Jones.
[2:06:29.880 --> 2:06:32.760]  You got Robert Barnes, a great constitutional lawyer, a good friend of mine with the smart
[2:06:32.760 --> 2:06:36.000]  people I know and the beautiful Roger Stone here with us.
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:39.960]  I want to talk about the big picture where the globalist are what they're doing the head
[2:06:39.960 --> 2:06:45.040]  of the IMF saying world collapse imminent devaluation sovereign defaults.
[2:06:45.040 --> 2:06:46.600]  I played the clips first hour.
[2:06:46.600 --> 2:06:51.120]  I mean, just horrifying news, we knew they were positioning us for this.
[2:06:51.120 --> 2:06:53.120]  She says it's an accident.
[2:06:53.120 --> 2:06:56.360]  That's a quote and that they don't know quote.
[2:06:56.360 --> 2:07:00.960]  We didn't think through the consequences of printing too much money.
[2:07:00.960 --> 2:07:03.560]  We already are out of time.
[2:07:03.560 --> 2:07:04.560]  Those are quotes.
[2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:05.560]  I played the video first hour.
[2:07:05.560 --> 2:07:11.680]  I mean, we are living in epic times and their answer is declare all Republicans are populist
[2:07:11.680 --> 2:07:18.000]  as terrorist if you question the election or for synoculations or lockdowns or open borders.
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:22.120]  We have the federal law on testing illegal aliens for diseases.
[2:07:22.120 --> 2:07:23.120]  That's being annulled.
[2:07:23.120 --> 2:07:27.680]  I mean, we are living in the new world order takeover.
[2:07:27.680 --> 2:07:31.520]  You got the Easter Bunny publicly giving the president directives.
[2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:35.120]  I mean, Robert Barnes, then we'll get to stone to get his take.
[2:07:35.120 --> 2:07:38.520]  What would you call this period of time we're in right now?
[2:07:38.520 --> 2:07:42.240]  Well, we're seeing the complete weaponization of the legal process.
[2:07:42.240 --> 2:07:49.080]  So, you know, the president Trump today is now facing $10,000 a day sanctions, so-called
[2:07:49.080 --> 2:07:52.880]  contempt for a proceeding that shouldn't be allowed to occur in the first place.
[2:07:52.880 --> 2:07:56.960]  I mean, you look at what they're being critical of the Santas with concerning Disney, which
[2:07:56.960 --> 2:08:02.080]  was a completely legal action contrast that to the direct targeting.
[2:08:02.080 --> 2:08:06.840]  The attorney general of New York ran on a campaign saying elect me, I'll go harass and
[2:08:06.840 --> 2:08:10.080]  use the legal process to harass Donald Trump.
[2:08:10.080 --> 2:08:13.880]  And the courts are not only allowing it, but now encouraging it, incentivizing it, and
[2:08:13.880 --> 2:08:14.880]  rewarding it.
[2:08:14.880 --> 2:08:16.680]  Three weeks after they did it to me, they're now doing it to him.
[2:08:16.680 --> 2:08:21.640]  And they're trying to take MTG's right to run for office because she said they're trying
[2:08:21.640 --> 2:08:25.760]  to frustrate voters will, so they try to frustrate voters will.
[2:08:25.760 --> 2:08:26.760]  Exactly.
[2:08:26.760 --> 2:08:30.120]  They're mischaracterizing the 14th Amendment provision that was only meant to apply to
[2:08:30.120 --> 2:08:35.400]  the Confederacy, which was annulled itself by the 1872 Amnesty Act as recognized by a
[2:08:35.400 --> 2:08:38.000]  federal court when Congressman Cawthorne brought that out.
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:41.760]  They're trying to say, when you're declared a foreign enemy, we can do this, but they're
[2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:44.560]  just declaring all their opposition an enemy.
[2:08:44.560 --> 2:08:45.560]  Correct.
[2:08:45.560 --> 2:08:50.240]  I mean, that, that, that story provision was that constitutional provision was only meant
[2:08:50.240 --> 2:08:54.840]  to apply to the Confederates, ex-Confederates, and we annulled it in 1872.
[2:08:54.840 --> 2:08:56.440]  And so it should not be applicable to anybody.
[2:08:56.440 --> 2:09:02.120]  It was misapplied to Congressman Berger for his opposition to World War One in, in 1918.
[2:09:02.120 --> 2:09:03.560]  But that was a misapplication of it.
[2:09:03.560 --> 2:09:07.640]  And now we're seeing it reinvigorated and they're trying to, you say, anybody who questioned
[2:09:07.640 --> 2:09:14.160]  the election, anybody who challenges an institutional narrative is now an insurrectionist.
[2:09:14.160 --> 2:09:17.400]  So it's part of the, with the January 6th cases, we saw it as part of the Whitmer and
[2:09:17.400 --> 2:09:18.800]  Trapman cases.
[2:09:18.800 --> 2:09:22.120]  It's part of what they're doing with Marjorie Taylor Greene and they try to do to Paul Gosar
[2:09:22.120 --> 2:09:23.120]  in Arizona.
[2:09:23.120 --> 2:09:24.120]  It failed.
[2:09:24.120 --> 2:09:25.120]  A court said it didn't have any legal basis.
[2:09:25.120 --> 2:09:26.480]  So it's an attempted outline your opposition.
[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:29.000]  What does that say about the Democrats in the deep state?
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:32.840]  Well, basically they're taking the same things Zelensky is doing with Ukraine, which is,
[2:09:32.840 --> 2:09:35.560]  I mean, they would like to apply the same people should watch that because they're trying
[2:09:35.560 --> 2:09:37.480]  to do the same project here.
[2:09:37.480 --> 2:09:39.760]  I mean, they're, they're banning opposition media.
[2:09:39.760 --> 2:09:44.160]  They're, they're locking up opposition leaders where they, they're just, you know, two steps
[2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:48.360]  ahead of where the Democrats would like to take the United States of America to lock
[2:09:48.360 --> 2:09:49.360]  up dissidents.
[2:09:49.360 --> 2:09:50.360]  That's right.
[2:09:50.360 --> 2:09:54.080]  The same locals around our country are advising Ukraine where they're banning even pro Zelensky
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:57.880]  parties, all opposition banned, all media control.
[2:09:57.880 --> 2:09:58.880]  Correct.
[2:09:58.880 --> 2:10:02.720]  In fact, there's only one single broadcast that's allowed throughout the country now.
[2:10:02.720 --> 2:10:07.440]  There are, I mean, people are getting, there's bloggers that are being summarily executed
[2:10:07.440 --> 2:10:08.960]  on the street.
[2:10:08.960 --> 2:10:13.520]  There was a journalist Gonzalo Lira who's an American citizen, Chilean citizen who disappeared
[2:10:13.520 --> 2:10:14.520]  for a week.
[2:10:14.520 --> 2:10:17.600]  And but for a bunch of us making noise may have been dead himself.
[2:10:17.600 --> 2:10:21.840]  So that's the mindset mentality that's infecting the West as well, infecting the United States
[2:10:21.840 --> 2:10:22.840]  as well.
[2:10:22.840 --> 2:10:26.680]  We're seeing the continuing, all the things they accuse Nixon of, as Roger can remember,
[2:10:26.680 --> 2:10:28.240]  these folks are actually doing.
[2:10:28.240 --> 2:10:31.160]  They said that, you know, Nixon had a hit list and all the rest.
[2:10:31.160 --> 2:10:35.400]  He didn't actually weaponize the IRS anywhere, like they're weaponizing the IRS now, they're
[2:10:35.400 --> 2:10:39.280]  weaponizing the law enforcement, weaponizing the Justice Department, weaponizing attorney
[2:10:39.280 --> 2:10:43.320]  generals, trying to criminalize and put in prison anybody who's a dissident or disagrees
[2:10:43.320 --> 2:10:44.320]  with the system.
[2:10:44.320 --> 2:10:46.480]  That's not what a strong group does, is it, Roger?
[2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:48.600]  No, I think that what you see is the hysteria.
[2:10:48.600 --> 2:10:54.280]  Look, the greatest single example of this is just north of us in Canada, the abuse of
[2:10:54.280 --> 2:11:03.480]  the Canadian truck convoy, the brutal authoritarian jackboot tactics used on peaceful protests.
[2:11:03.480 --> 2:11:08.560]  No bail, charged with terrorism, freezing their bank accounts, making it impossible
[2:11:08.560 --> 2:11:10.360]  for them to eat.
[2:11:10.360 --> 2:11:16.840]  Derek Sloan, a former conservative member of parliament, now with the Ontario Party, outspoken
[2:11:16.840 --> 2:11:25.400]  in the, against all of this, now seeking election in Ontario to take away the conservative
[2:11:25.400 --> 2:11:29.760]  party folks in Canada, is not in any way conservative.
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:34.520]  So even there, the revolution has spread, and if you want to see what's going to happen
[2:11:34.520 --> 2:11:37.440]  there, here, just look at what happened there.
[2:11:37.440 --> 2:11:42.680]  Also notice that the American truck convoy got no media coverage virtually at all.
[2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:48.120]  It was like a blackout, like it didn't even happen.
[2:11:48.120 --> 2:11:51.440]  Robert Barnes, I could ask questions here, but what do you want to get into with Roger
[2:11:51.440 --> 2:11:53.040]  Shonen and I as we ride shotgun here?
[2:11:53.040 --> 2:11:54.040]  There's so much happening.
[2:11:54.040 --> 2:11:58.000]  What do you want to hit first?
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:02.320]  Well I think January 6th is a good nexus because they're trying to use the mythology of what
[2:12:02.320 --> 2:12:06.320]  they've created with January 6th, still covering up some of their complicity and culpability
[2:12:06.320 --> 2:12:11.240]  related to, I mean, look at how the media has covered the, 60 minutes, did a Sunday interview
[2:12:11.240 --> 2:12:16.040]  with Christopher Wray and managed to not bring up the Whitmer acquittals at all.
[2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:20.960]  I mean that was those bogus charges, those pure government entrapment, makes the Marion
[2:12:20.960 --> 2:12:23.280]  Barry entrapment look like light change.
[2:12:23.280 --> 2:12:27.640]  You look at all of what happened and they attempt to politically weaponize that case.
[2:12:27.640 --> 2:12:30.840]  It turned out it was totally bogus, the jury saw it as totally bogus.
[2:12:30.840 --> 2:12:34.720]  They took us, you know, basically some people who lived in their grandma's basement and
[2:12:34.720 --> 2:12:39.280]  tried to pretend that they were master criminal conspirators and wanted several of the key
[2:12:39.280 --> 2:12:44.520]  investigators connected to that case, several of them ended up in prison themselves or under
[2:12:44.520 --> 2:12:46.280]  criminal investigation.
[2:12:46.280 --> 2:12:50.480]  Others though were promoted and put in charge of the January 6th cases in D.C.
[2:12:50.480 --> 2:12:54.560]  So the pattern we saw with the Whitmer cases that was detailed in front of that jury was
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:12:58.920]  replicated in the January 6th cases and they're using that to try to keep congressmen out
[2:12:58.920 --> 2:12:59.920]  of Congress.
[2:12:59.920 --> 2:13:04.320]  They're using it to try to lock up a very, a range of dissidents who are still sitting
[2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:11.240]  in jail 15, 16 months later without even a trial date being set.
[2:13:11.240 --> 2:13:15.120]  In some of these cases, they're very minor charges, very inconsequential and significant
[2:13:15.120 --> 2:13:16.120]  charges.
[2:13:16.120 --> 2:13:17.120]  You're right.
[2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:19.200]  They admit this is the model for everybody else right now.
[2:13:19.200 --> 2:13:20.200]  So how is it going?
[2:13:20.200 --> 2:13:22.720]  How do we counter it?
[2:13:22.720 --> 2:13:25.520]  Continue to counter it in the court of public opinion and then where there's legal remedies
[2:13:25.520 --> 2:13:28.320]  and options and alternatives to do it there as well.
[2:13:28.320 --> 2:13:31.400]  Because they're going to continue to, I mean, what happened with Whitmer is that case got
[2:13:31.400 --> 2:13:37.000]  exposed by good legal review and by good public exposure for people who don't know that's
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  the governor of Michigan.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:41.400]  They said that there was this plot to kidnapper that helped the Democrats right before the
[2:13:41.400 --> 2:13:42.400]  election.
[2:13:42.400 --> 2:13:44.520]  Some of us said at the time it's a matter of entrapment.
[2:13:44.520 --> 2:13:46.600]  A jury determined it was entrapment.
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:51.360]  They found acquittals and convicted nobody of anything related to those cases.
[2:13:51.360 --> 2:13:54.280]  They're trying to do the same thing with the January 6th cases.
[2:13:54.280 --> 2:13:57.880]  So arguing in the court of public opinion, getting the information out there, there needs
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:14:01.120]  to be more assertive action and candidates need to run on this.
[2:14:01.120 --> 2:14:05.080]  To his credit, President Trump has said he will pardon everybody connected to the January
[2:14:05.080 --> 2:14:08.960]  6th event and that's why they're going to target him and continue to go after him.
[2:14:08.960 --> 2:14:13.760]  But we have to continue to educate in the court of public opinion, continue to inform,
[2:14:13.760 --> 2:14:18.880]  and we need more public commitment from people running for office that they're going to investigate
[2:14:18.880 --> 2:14:24.080]  what the FBI's role was, what Christopher Ray's role was, what the 7th floor the FBI
[2:14:24.080 --> 2:14:25.080]  was up to.
[2:14:25.080 --> 2:14:29.600]  We've seen the continued political weaponization of this process and we need to see meaningful
[2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:31.200]  coverage of the Suspension Trial.
[2:14:31.200 --> 2:14:35.200]  I mean that case exposes the degree to which Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National
[2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:40.200]  Committee and the Democratic Party were completely culpable and complicit in arranging everything
[2:14:40.200 --> 2:14:42.560]  related to both Russia Gate and Spy Gate.
[2:14:42.560 --> 2:14:46.440]  That trial the media is trying to completely suppress coverage of but it's about to happen
[2:14:46.440 --> 2:14:48.080]  in the District of Columbia.
[2:14:48.080 --> 2:14:51.840]  Major filings and a person that should be looked at for criminal investigation indictment
[2:14:51.840 --> 2:14:53.320]  is Mark Elias.
[2:14:53.320 --> 2:14:59.280]  It's clear Mark Elias was laundering information, illicit information, illicitly obtained information,
[2:14:59.280 --> 2:15:05.080]  illicitly provided information as attorney-client privilege when it's not even apparent he had
[2:15:05.080 --> 2:15:07.440]  appropriate attorney-client privilege with any of it.
[2:15:07.440 --> 2:15:13.280]  So he's the Democratic lawyer hit man who should be criminally indicted by John Durham
[2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:17.440]  if Durham's going to do his job and that needs to be part of the court of public opinion
[2:15:17.440 --> 2:15:18.440]  as well as we move forward.
[2:15:18.440 --> 2:15:20.680]  All right, you got a bunch of other topics.
[2:15:20.680 --> 2:15:23.160]  Tell me what else you want to get to when we come back because I got a bunch of questions.
[2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:24.160]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:15:24.160 --> 2:15:30.360]  I mean, there's a range of subjects that are right, hot on the agenda, including issues
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:34.640]  related to the vaccine and mask mandates, issues related to what's happening in Ukraine,
[2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:38.520]  false flags that may be occurring at any given moment given the recent trip of Secretary
[2:15:38.520 --> 2:15:39.520]  Austin there.
[2:15:39.520 --> 2:15:41.160]  So there's a range of topics to cover.
[2:15:41.160 --> 2:15:43.400]  Roger, what do you want to hit?
[2:15:43.400 --> 2:15:46.880]  Well, this New York action, Robert's absolutely right.
[2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:49.800]  They're petrified about running against Donald Trump.
[2:15:49.800 --> 2:15:52.200]  Their first case in Manhattan is to come back.
[2:15:52.200 --> 2:15:53.200]  Robert Stone in studio.
[2:15:53.200 --> 2:15:54.200]  Yeah.
[2:15:54.200 --> 2:16:01.080]  You know, it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true that info wars
[2:16:01.080 --> 2:16:09.120]  is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist
[2:16:09.120 --> 2:16:13.800]  resistance against their transhumanist anti human program.
[2:16:13.800 --> 2:16:20.480]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever

[2:20:03.600 --> 2:20:11.600]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:11.600 --> 2:20:24.760]  He's a gentleman the magnitude of what we're covering is so incredible and the big set
[2:20:24.760 --> 2:20:30.240]  piece of the globalist the Rockefeller Foundation and Carnegie Foundation that runs the CIA
[2:20:30.240 --> 2:20:36.480]  was operation lockstep in the last 26 months 28 months of tyranny we witness I want to
[2:20:36.480 --> 2:20:40.400]  get constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes take on that the big developments where it's going
[2:20:40.400 --> 2:20:46.160]  and then Roger Stones because they admit in the EU in Canada other places they plan to
[2:20:46.160 --> 2:20:51.600]  bring the lockdowns back before after the election China has 400 million under lockdown
[2:20:51.600 --> 2:20:58.720]  first it started to shangha now it's spread a giant drill and a test in martial law so
[2:20:58.720 --> 2:21:03.400]  what happened in the past what's coming in the future but also how do you see this agenda
[2:21:03.400 --> 2:21:09.720]  unfolding in the future Robert Barnes well I mean on the one aspect it's positive potentially
[2:21:09.720 --> 2:21:14.360]  that Elon Musk is buying Twitter and if he the best way Elon Musk can prove that Twitter
[2:21:14.360 --> 2:21:19.080]  is back to a free speech zone is to reinstate Alex Jones so let's see if he does that right
[2:21:19.080 --> 2:21:22.920]  out of the gate that will tell us what he's up to is he is he the person he has claimed
[2:21:22.920 --> 2:21:28.560]  himself to be a free speech champion or is he what his critics say well he can prove
[2:21:28.560 --> 2:21:32.920]  it real easy just by reinstating Alex Jones as his first act back on Twitter and reinstating
[2:21:32.920 --> 2:21:37.920]  President Donald John Trump so do those steps and that will at least restore Twitter to
[2:21:37.920 --> 2:21:43.680]  some degree of sanity from where it's been under big tech control now the second aspect
[2:21:43.680 --> 2:21:49.920]  is one little component about the French elections today that you know Le Pen lost there were
[2:21:49.920 --> 2:21:55.760]  some anomalies being reported out of the French elections in particular territories outside
[2:21:55.760 --> 2:22:01.360]  of the continental control in other words the places like Marnique Guadalupe etc these places
[2:22:01.360 --> 2:22:09.480]  showed a 30 to 40 point swing from 2017 to 2022 in favor of Le Pen yet no no place inside
[2:22:09.480 --> 2:22:14.440]  the continent of France on the continent in France showed any such similar swing exactly
[2:22:14.440 --> 2:22:19.200]  the few places where they weren't federally controlled she won massively but everywhere
[2:22:19.200 --> 2:22:24.280]  else she lost exactly and these are places that she lost by 50 points last time that
[2:22:24.280 --> 2:22:29.280]  she won I mean that's that kind of margin swing so the melanchon vote which is sort
[2:22:29.280 --> 2:22:36.120]  of a Bernie Sanders style vote swung towards her in places that Macron didn't have complete
[2:22:36.120 --> 2:22:39.800]  more election control than places that come back to you Mars but Roger you're an election
[2:22:39.800 --> 2:22:45.120]  expert you said it's too early to tell but the polls don't fit you smell something stinky
[2:22:45.120 --> 2:22:49.760]  here what do you think's going on in France well I saw the same thing happen in the United
[2:22:49.760 --> 2:22:55.800]  States the last time when I went to bed Le Pen was up by 300,000 votes when I woke up
[2:22:55.800 --> 2:23:01.640]  her margin had disappeared Macron is actually less popular than Joe Biden if such a thing
[2:23:01.640 --> 2:23:07.600]  is possible and if you read any of the survey research in the closing days and you know
[2:23:07.600 --> 2:23:12.760]  how to read a poll and you studied the crosstabs which I did in a number of occasions it was
[2:23:12.760 --> 2:23:19.520]  clear that there was a tidal wave coming for the right also when the the extreme right
[2:23:19.520 --> 2:23:25.600]  party candidate endorsed and urged his supporters to vote for Le Pen it was clear that there
[2:23:25.600 --> 2:23:30.880]  was a landslide coming I think the will of the French people has been thwarted this whole
[2:23:30.880 --> 2:23:36.280]  thing smells bad I agree so where does this go it goes nowhere I think it is a it's a
[2:23:36.280 --> 2:23:40.760]  cautionary tale for the United States what just happened here a couple years ago exactly
[2:23:40.760 --> 2:23:46.000]  what do you see Barnes it is a concern and so we'll see how it plays a role in the upcoming
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:51.200]  parliamentary elections because the polls to Roger's point show the right winning the
[2:23:51.200 --> 2:23:56.440]  parliamentary elections they're coming up in just a few months and so let's see what happens
[2:23:56.440 --> 2:24:01.480]  in those elections because it's this is a very what as Roger knows one of the ways you
[2:24:01.480 --> 2:24:06.920]  smell out election fraud is you see unusual disparities in similar constituencies right
[2:24:06.920 --> 2:24:10.880]  so you see neighboring precincts in one of them I mean this happened frankly in the Roy
[2:24:10.880 --> 2:24:16.160]  Moore race in Alabama in 2017 you know you had neighboring precincts that had one turned
[2:24:16.160 --> 2:24:21.400]  out at 80% the other turned out at 55% and it's identical demographics identical partisan
[2:24:21.400 --> 2:24:26.040]  profile that just doesn't happen you see it all across the state in case of album here
[2:24:26.040 --> 2:24:30.680]  when you see it's it'd be one thing if it was just Martinique or just Guadalupe or just
[2:24:30.680 --> 2:24:36.040]  Corsica just one of these other places that are a part of the offshore international components
[2:24:36.040 --> 2:24:43.160]  of the French elections but all of them swung massively towards Mila Penn and no place inside
[2:24:43.160 --> 2:24:48.720]  Paris or inside France swung anywhere close to sure so just like Venezuela they hold elections
[2:24:48.720 --> 2:24:54.000]  but they're fake how do we counter this Roger here is the answer Kerry Lake candidate for
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:58.320]  governor in Arizona and Mark Fincham is running for secretary of state have come up with the
[2:24:58.320 --> 2:25:03.880]  answer we need to return to paper ballots that is the answer they've gone to court to
[2:25:03.880 --> 2:25:09.960]  try to knock out computerized voting I spoke yesterday to Jackson Lawmire the crusading
[2:25:09.960 --> 2:25:15.440]  and surgeon Cumber pastor running for the US Senate in Oklahoma they're investigating
[2:25:15.440 --> 2:25:21.280]  doing that there so I think we need to knock out the computerized voting and we need to
[2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:26.280]  return to paper ballots and accountability that is the answer Barnes what's the answer
[2:25:26.280 --> 2:25:32.080]  in your view well the same thing that we was the true of 2020 election we need only constitutionally
[2:25:32.080 --> 2:25:37.120]  qualified people voting we need people only voting by methods that are constitutionally
[2:25:37.120 --> 2:25:43.120]  qualified going to Roger's point about paper ballot in person and third the way the vote
[2:25:43.120 --> 2:25:47.880]  is counted and the way the vote is canvassed needs to be constitutionally qualified what
[2:25:47.880 --> 2:25:52.840]  does that mean it means as determined by the state legislature if there's any method by
[2:25:52.840 --> 2:25:58.400]  which people are voting if there's any people groups that are voting or any a means by which
[2:25:58.400 --> 2:26:04.040]  their votes are counted or canvassed that is contrary to the rules set by the state legislature
[2:26:04.040 --> 2:26:09.120]  that is an unconstitutional election particularly let's cut to the chase here according to the
[2:26:09.120 --> 2:26:13.240]  state department's own rules what you're saying is true so we go out and declare other elections
[2:26:13.240 --> 2:26:17.840]  fraudulent when our own elections are fraudulent as well how do you beat election fraud of
[2:26:17.840 --> 2:26:23.480]  this magnitude well the utility this is one place where Barack Obama was right long time
[2:26:23.480 --> 2:26:29.640]  ago when he said it's tough to commit a systemic election fraud unless you do it in a certain
[2:26:29.640 --> 2:26:33.800]  way and in the reason he meant by that is that elections are still very local every
[2:26:33.800 --> 2:26:40.160]  person can volunteer to be a precinct observer every person can participate at the low elections
[2:26:40.160 --> 2:26:44.960]  are still down at the most local level in terms of where votes are counted in canvas
[2:26:44.960 --> 2:26:49.920]  they can use the sunshine laws like they did in Georgia the variations of open records
[2:26:49.920 --> 2:26:56.160]  laws or freedom of information laws whatever the state analog provision is to inspect the
[2:26:56.160 --> 2:27:01.520]  voting records inspect who's registered to vote inspect just let me stand on that with
[2:27:01.520 --> 2:27:06.160]  197 days after the midterms and I'm gonna come back and ask this Roger next segment
[2:27:06.160 --> 2:27:11.120]  but the minute and a half we have left with Barnes we're gonna break how does the deep
[2:27:11.120 --> 2:27:16.640]  state counter this awakening the election fraud this total red tsunami how are they
[2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:21.360]  gonna counter that because they obviously are desperate and scared right now well by
[2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:26.000]  what they've done which is to create a fake narrative around January 6 really wasn't about
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:31.440]  January 6 January 6 was about covering up the crime that took place in November 2020
[2:27:31.440 --> 2:27:36.720]  January 6 was about re narrating re scripting re crafting the official narrative so that
[2:27:36.720 --> 2:27:41.920]  anybody who talked about November 2020 would be affiliated with insurrectionist with coup
[2:27:41.920 --> 2:27:47.760]  plotters with with revolutionary exactly never question they say that's a terrorist act
[2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:52.720]  the question election that's exactly right and that that's and that's where they're
[2:27:52.720 --> 2:27:55.680]  going to continue to go and that's why they have to keep doubling down that's why the
[2:27:55.680 --> 2:28:00.080]  January 6 committee which is an unconstitutionally formed committee formed in a manner that violates
[2:28:00.080 --> 2:28:04.320]  the very rules of congresses itself shouldn't even be allowed to exist if the courts were
[2:28:04.320 --> 2:28:08.240]  doing our job rather than do it you know being asleep at the wheel in District of Columbia
[2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:12.960]  as Roger knows unfortunately the judges in the District of Columbia can be anything but
[2:28:12.960 --> 2:28:18.960]  impartial and the jury pools are the same way and so there needs to be constant public exposure
[2:28:18.960 --> 2:28:23.040]  of this in the court of public opinion and constant reminder of what really took place in
[2:28:23.040 --> 2:28:28.560]  November and not allow these intimidation efforts to intimidate anybody in the populace
[2:28:28.560 --> 2:28:32.880]  to do anything different but to continue to expose the truth as it is Robert Barnes stay there
[2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:36.560]  Roger Stone stay there we're going to hit the vaccine issue I raised with uncover
[2:28:36.560 --> 2:28:40.880]  we're going to hit the Ukraine issue we're going to hit the economy issue the IMF the

[2:31:13.440 --> 2:31:18.400]  because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars and now
[2:31:18.400 --> 2:31:23.600]  with bandot video getting close to 10 million views a day we're a platform for thousands
[2:31:23.600 --> 2:31:30.080]  of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge and because
[2:31:30.080 --> 2:31:37.120]  it's become so successful it's a catch 22 info wars and bandot video have become a mother ship
[2:31:37.120 --> 2:31:43.120]  promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions
[2:31:43.120 --> 2:31:48.000]  of dollars a quarter hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month so the biggest sale

[2:31:59.200 --> 2:32:06.720]  the first casualty of war is the truth then the next big casualty isn't even the people that die
[2:32:07.440 --> 2:32:14.880]  no that invariably follows but first there is the crackdown on populations basic liberty
[2:32:14.880 --> 2:32:20.560]  and speech and massive censorship and now across the world from the united states to europe
[2:32:20.560 --> 2:32:30.400]  are legislations being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro-russian information you
[2:32:30.400 --> 2:32:36.480]  can be censored you can be arrested you can be imprisoned and of course now banners introduce
[2:32:36.480 --> 2:32:42.880]  legislation that if you have a fought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage
[2:32:43.440 --> 2:32:49.680]  in hate speech online that you will be censored and arrested ladies and gentlemen the authoritarianism
[2:32:49.680 --> 2:32:54.000]  is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes them
[2:32:54.000 --> 2:33:20.400]  fours dot com more important than ever leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[2:33:24.560 --> 2:33:30.720]  i want to thank all the listeners for your support and helping us really race a lot of
[2:33:30.720 --> 2:33:34.960]  the deficit we have to fund ourselves x2 the amazing deep earth crystal ion that's so great
[2:33:34.960 --> 2:33:41.200]  for your body is back in stock at info wars store dot com we have robert barnes via skype we have
[2:33:41.200 --> 2:33:46.000]  the great roger stone here in studio with us and i was asking roger what he wanted to hit next
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:50.560]  and i know barnes wants to hit this we have the whole germ investigation really gaining a lot of
[2:33:50.560 --> 2:33:55.760]  steam and a lot of fruit right now so roger why don't you speak to how big this is we'll get robert
[2:33:55.760 --> 2:34:01.040]  barnes take on it i think it is potentially enormous uh yesterday terrific our interview
[2:34:01.040 --> 2:34:06.800]  with john radcliffe the former texas republican congressman who was the director of national
[2:34:06.800 --> 2:34:12.560]  intelligence who said that there are a number of documents that have still not been declassified
[2:34:12.560 --> 2:34:18.080]  that he has seen which would bust the Durham investigation much wider open you call it a
[2:34:18.080 --> 2:34:24.320]  criminal conspiracy to frustrate the voters and engage in massive fraud it is outrageous to me
[2:34:24.320 --> 2:34:29.760]  that sustenance attorneys want to bar all of their activities from the record saying that
[2:34:29.760 --> 2:34:35.280]  they're pejorative and they smear him uh and Durham pointed to my case to demonstrate his
[2:34:35.280 --> 2:34:40.320]  authority to do whatever he wanted which i found interesting the real question though and i would
[2:34:40.320 --> 2:34:45.760]  defer to robert on this is have the statute of limitations run on most of these crimes in other
[2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:51.440]  words everything leads to john podesta and that leads to hillary clinton she is the one who is
[2:34:51.440 --> 2:34:57.280]  the head of this particular quarterback the whole rush of fraud to defraud voters and to distract
[2:34:57.280 --> 2:35:03.200]  from their own involvement with the russians it's john podesta and his brother who made millions
[2:35:03.200 --> 2:35:10.160]  from the oligarchs around uh vladimir putin not paul maniforte not roger stone no one associated
[2:35:10.160 --> 2:35:16.800]  with donald trump so but the real question is has this to has the time limit barred the prosecution
[2:35:16.800 --> 2:35:24.000]  of these criminals and even if they do go to trial in the district of columbia can uh can the people
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:32.160]  get justice or are the courts there so rigged so biased so one-sided uh that the truth will never
[2:35:32.160 --> 2:35:37.360]  come home and what green light does this give the deep state the permanent state to fully weaponize
[2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:44.560]  the justice department and everything against the american people yeah i mean i think well on the
[2:35:44.560 --> 2:35:49.920]  what is being exposed in the case is the degree to which the clinton campaign was neck deep in all
[2:35:49.920 --> 2:35:54.240]  of this what some others said from the very beginning was that that they that they would find
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:35:59.280]  that perkins co the big corporate law firm was the laundering source for this illicit information
[2:35:59.280 --> 2:36:03.760]  because they could disguise it they could hide it from you told me that on air and personally
[2:36:03.760 --> 2:36:09.600]  four years ago exactly i mean we talked about it then and because it was a classic pattern and it
[2:36:09.600 --> 2:36:13.920]  was how do you hide this from your campaign finance report that the clinton campaign
[2:36:13.920 --> 2:36:18.320]  is buying laundered fake dossiers that it's laundering through the law enforcement then
[2:36:18.320 --> 2:36:22.400]  back to the media i mean it was multiple levels of laundering well they disguised it as legal
[2:36:22.400 --> 2:36:26.480]  fee payment they said oh no we're just paying our law firm so on the campaign finance reported
[2:36:26.480 --> 2:36:30.640]  did not disclose their payments that were going to fuse and the lawyer went in the line of the
[2:36:30.640 --> 2:36:35.120]  fbi and the cia when he gave the info saying no it's not political even though he was handed the
[2:36:35.120 --> 2:36:42.720]  material yes correct and now there i think durham is going to great lengths to cover up the culpability
[2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:48.400]  and complicity of high ranking cia and fbi officials if this was an honest inquiry james
[2:36:48.400 --> 2:36:53.120]  comey would have been indicted peter stroke would have been indicted uh john brennan would have been
[2:36:53.120 --> 2:36:57.360]  indicted clapper would have been indicted hillary clinton would have been indicted what do you think
[2:36:57.360 --> 2:37:03.680]  durham's up to uh durham's history is he's a cover-up artist so his goal is to make this look
[2:37:03.680 --> 2:37:09.120]  like it was just an external corruption hey there's a few low-level actors even the decline
[2:37:09.120 --> 2:37:14.000]  smith he gave a sweetheart deal to even though he perjured himself in a fisa warrant application
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:19.440]  the let to make it sound like hey our fbi guys are nice our cia guys are great to cover up for
[2:37:19.440 --> 2:37:23.520]  the real deep state and throw him a few fall guys and we're literally sitting here with one of the
[2:37:23.520 --> 2:37:29.760]  main victims of it roger stone so so what i think is happening here frankly is unfortunately uh the
[2:37:29.760 --> 2:37:34.800]  obamas are done with the clintons they want them off the stage so in a certain sense what i think
[2:37:34.800 --> 2:37:41.360]  happens is that durham off offers a blistering report which condemns hillary clinton which points
[2:37:41.360 --> 2:37:46.000]  out the criminality of her and her operatives but unfortunately he reaches the conclusion
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:50.880]  that because he took his sweet time the five years has run out and they can't be prosecuted
[2:37:50.880 --> 2:37:58.640]  now the clintons are out of the way for the launch of uh michelle obamas 2024 presidential campaign
[2:37:58.640 --> 2:38:05.600]  i'm going on record right now on the show telling you that she not kamala harris not joe biden
[2:38:05.600 --> 2:38:12.320]  will be the democratic nominee so biden is doing pardon me durham in my opinion is doing the bidding
[2:38:12.320 --> 2:38:18.080]  of the deep state that wants to clear the deck of the clintons the clintons uh and the at this point
[2:38:18.080 --> 2:38:25.200]  the biden's carry too much baggage with the american electorate uh the obama connections
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:31.280]  to the russian collusion hoax which are at the very top because essentially the obama
[2:38:31.280 --> 2:38:37.920]  administrations fbi and cia at the behest of hillary clinton try to wire the election for her
[2:38:37.920 --> 2:38:43.600]  and then try to discredit trump and remove them uh but but none of the stink sticks to the obamas
[2:38:43.600 --> 2:38:49.200]  uh and therefore i think he is just helping shuffle the clintons off into the social let me
[2:38:49.200 --> 2:38:54.160]  ask roger stone and robert barnes's question how do they extricate themselves from biden
[2:38:54.160 --> 2:38:58.800]  who they knew would be a puppet but is rotting faster than they thought in my view how do they
[2:38:58.800 --> 2:39:03.440]  extricate themselves from that before the midterm after the midterm as you're predicting i think
[2:39:03.440 --> 2:39:08.400]  you're right roger and then what comes out of that and who do they position when he's gone
[2:39:08.400 --> 2:39:13.920]  on the 25th amendment in to the winehouse and what does that signify well let's recognize that
[2:39:13.920 --> 2:39:18.720]  were that to happen in other words were they to remove biden or the 25th amendment which i
[2:39:18.720 --> 2:39:23.440]  predicted on this show they're going to do after the election and kamala harris were to become
[2:39:23.440 --> 2:39:28.960]  therefore president she would have the authority to nominate a new vice president and that vice
[2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:33.600]  president would have to be confirmed by the u.s senate now what happens in the senate election
[2:39:33.600 --> 2:39:39.760]  uh is mitch mcconnell going to confirm uh because he had the votes to confirm whoever it is she
[2:39:39.760 --> 2:39:46.560]  chooses does she choose michelle obama the pressure on her would be to appoint hillary clinton
[2:39:46.560 --> 2:39:52.400]  that's why john durham has to eliminate hillary clinton as a potential vice president to get her
[2:39:52.400 --> 2:39:58.480]  out of the line of succession that's what this is really all about hey you guys at media matters
[2:39:58.480 --> 2:40:03.040]  run write that down right now go report on it because that's what's about to happen i want
[2:40:03.040 --> 2:40:07.760]  to get barnes take but i saw that headline i saw the video this morning i don't trust cruz as far
[2:40:07.760 --> 2:40:12.400]  as i can throw him he's a smart guy he's right though getting rid of biden is dangerous as hell
[2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:16.560]  biden is dangerous but what they're going to pull once he's gone i think it'd be worse what do you
[2:40:16.560 --> 2:40:22.400]  think barnes i no doubt about that uh i mean you knew what the sort of deep state was up to back
[2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:26.800]  when uh they got rid of agnew for nixon i mean that was this that was the warning sign to nixon
[2:40:26.800 --> 2:40:31.360]  and they tried to cover himself was unable to do so because uh ford was someone they were satisfied
[2:40:31.360 --> 2:40:36.000]  with no doubt i mean if you're kamala harris and hillary clinton is your vice president i mean
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:40.640]  can you get life insurance you know six months three months you need a food taster the odds are
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:46.720]  so i think that but i agree that the whoever the next vice presidential nominee is uh if they take
[2:40:46.720 --> 2:40:51.280]  out biden and i think that's what the hunter biden stuff is about there's no way they could actually
[2:40:51.280 --> 2:40:55.520]  go with a full-scale criminal indictment hunter biden because that leads to everybody in the
[2:40:55.520 --> 2:40:59.520]  democratic party and a bunch of deep state actors including those bio labs in ukraine
[2:40:59.520 --> 2:41:03.920]  so they can't actually do it i think it's an extortionate threat to try to get biden to play
[2:41:03.920 --> 2:41:09.920]  ball or resign when necessary but uh the problem is kamala harris is more unpopular than him
[2:41:09.920 --> 2:41:13.920]  so that would mean if they take out biden they would be taking him out for the purposes of
[2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:18.320]  replacing him with whoever kamala's vice president is and that would be the thing to watch whoever
[2:41:18.320 --> 2:41:23.840]  that person is is the person that is going to be the next uh president obviously you're right so
[2:41:23.840 --> 2:41:29.760]  let me ask this question constitutionally it would be an equipment wrong you guys are part of that on
[2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:38.080]  this it would be polosi how does hillary get herself in there uh well not necessarily so if
[2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:42.720]  kamala harris were to rise to the presidency this is where i disagree with robert she's no more or
[2:41:42.720 --> 2:41:47.440]  less dangerous than than joe biden because neither one of them is running the country
[2:41:47.440 --> 2:41:54.640]  barack obama is your de facto president susan rice ron claim essentially report to barack
[2:41:54.640 --> 2:41:59.440]  they're in the third term they're in their third term so it doesn't really matter whether kamala
[2:41:59.440 --> 2:42:05.360]  harris uh is president uh although that laugh is extraordinarily annoying but if biden was taken
[2:42:05.360 --> 2:42:10.080]  down then what is the line of ascension well uh you still have to confirm a vice president so
[2:42:10.880 --> 2:42:16.560]  kamala harris would rise to the presidency she would be entitled to appoint a vice president
[2:42:16.560 --> 2:42:22.640]  uh and that vice president have to be confirmed by the senate to be legally in line otherwise the
[2:42:22.640 --> 2:42:29.040]  speaker of the house would remain in line now did we take control of the house in 2022 we don't
[2:42:29.040 --> 2:42:34.480]  know yet and if we did take control who is the speaker is kevin mccarthy in line for the presidency
[2:42:34.480 --> 2:42:40.560]  is jim jordan in line for the presidency uh is some i don't know freshman scott baw from
[2:42:40.560 --> 2:42:45.680]  california some freshman uh could be speaker of the house anything's in town is we are headed to
[2:42:45.680 --> 2:42:50.880]  extremely interesting times i want to talk about russia the world economy and more with robert barnes

[2:47:23.680 --> 2:47:31.120]  they've just halted twitter stock sales and it's being announced everywhere as we speak
[2:47:31.120 --> 2:47:37.120]  elon musk has taken over twitter so this is a big big deal and now the test will be
[2:47:37.760 --> 2:47:42.080]  will he reinstate the former president of the united states of the real president
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:49.840]  roger stone alex jones and countless others and it's not like i even care if i'm on there it's
[2:47:49.840 --> 2:47:55.680]  that it's a sign and we're hoping elon musk is for real i hope that even my worst critics
[2:47:55.680 --> 2:48:02.320]  remain on twitter because that is what free speech means this is an epic moment roger stone it really
[2:48:02.320 --> 2:48:08.160]  is i want my 980 000 followers back is it a beautiful you have been there in two and a half years
[2:48:08.160 --> 2:48:12.480]  being under attack and you're here for the name of this it's really extraordinary plus the number of
[2:48:12.480 --> 2:48:18.720]  reporters at the new york times on suicide watch right now is record-breaking i mean uh liberals
[2:48:18.720 --> 2:48:24.400]  every place are about to slit their wrists because this was their sewer that this was a tsunami
[2:48:24.400 --> 2:48:29.920]  of hatred it was their bullying operation they're doxing there it really is that literally a million
[2:48:29.920 --> 2:48:34.080]  tweets or something last week i trended number one for two days saying i'm coming to the feds
[2:48:34.080 --> 2:48:40.080]  i say we attack january 6 all made up all eyes and i couldn't counter and say that's bs because you
[2:48:40.080 --> 2:48:45.280]  because when they smear you you have no enormous platform to go to look i love gab i think they
[2:48:45.280 --> 2:48:51.120]  do a great job i like telegram i think they did david versus goliath but but it's it's just not
[2:48:51.120 --> 2:48:56.880]  you know never had the critical mass that twitter has uh true i love paul watson's if you don't like
[2:48:56.880 --> 2:49:02.640]  elon musk by twitter just build your own twitter uh robert barnes i'm so glad the two guys i love
[2:49:02.640 --> 2:49:06.880]  that are still the smart people i know you and roger stoner together now this is the story
[2:49:06.880 --> 2:49:12.720]  we're on air right now when elon musk is taking twitter over it's extraordinary i'm sure there's
[2:49:12.720 --> 2:49:17.520]  going to be a lot of panic at twitter uh in a lot of its engineers and the rest because musk has
[2:49:17.520 --> 2:49:24.160]  very publicly uh stated his commitment to uh making returning twitter to its free speech routes
[2:49:24.160 --> 2:49:29.440]  people forget jack dorsi said twitter was going to be the free speech wing of the free speech party
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:35.840]  and based on dorsi's recent commentary uh it looks like somebody hijacked twitter and took
[2:49:35.840 --> 2:49:41.360]  it away even from dorsi because dorsi appears that he's still unhappy with how dorsi's come out
[2:49:41.360 --> 2:49:48.880]  the tax cnn stelter and censorship when i was told by i'll just say it roger stone's here with us
[2:49:48.880 --> 2:49:55.520]  and we've got you here you know i shouldn't say who but i sorry just i'm not going to even talk
[2:49:55.520 --> 2:50:00.240]  about it but the point is i was told two years ago no no jack dorsi's a listener he's been taking
[2:50:00.240 --> 2:50:04.960]  control of and i'm like i don't really believe that and the guy goes okay here's the text messages
[2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:09.680]  alex jones is always right i listen to him every day i wish i could have stopped this but hopefully
[2:50:09.680 --> 2:50:15.840]  you guys can defeat it and that was jack dorsi and i was shown these texts by a very famous
[2:50:15.840 --> 2:50:20.880]  podcaster the most famous podcaster of him saying that and i was dumb like four years ago i didn't
[2:50:20.880 --> 2:50:26.880]  believe it when i was told he was actually on my side uh it's really quite extraordinary uh my appeal
[2:50:26.880 --> 2:50:32.960]  to mr musk would be to clean house you cannot trust the people that he said he's going to turn
[2:50:32.960 --> 2:50:36.960]  their main headquarters in san francisco into a homeless shelter great idea terrific idea i mean
[2:50:36.960 --> 2:50:41.600]  they're up go ahead uh he really needs to clean house you've already seen the attitude of the
[2:50:41.600 --> 2:50:46.640]  employees in management the statement they put out in opposition to musk we don't care about profit
[2:50:46.640 --> 2:50:50.640]  we don't care about the company we're not gonna yeah and we take no direction from the board see the
[2:50:50.640 --> 2:50:56.240]  board seat was a trap if musk had taken a seat on the board he would have been prohibited from
[2:50:56.240 --> 2:51:03.440]  acquiring more stock so that was a trap he very wisely sidestepped that trap uh this could be a
[2:51:03.440 --> 2:51:09.040]  this could be a monumental day for free expression and the right to cause one big domino falls they
[2:51:09.040 --> 2:51:13.360]  all fall robert barnes i'm so glad you're here with us in this historic moment this is big
[2:51:14.480 --> 2:51:19.280]  and no doubt about it and i think it was also a smart move by musk because there's aspects
[2:51:19.280 --> 2:51:25.280]  of the biden administration aspects of the deep state that want to control musk and have been
[2:51:25.280 --> 2:51:30.320]  threatening various forms of civil and criminal investigations to try to punish him and if you
[2:51:30.320 --> 2:51:35.680]  are the owner he's he said he's gonna take twitter private so we'll no longer have any esg corporate
[2:51:35.680 --> 2:51:41.200]  board or any of that nonsense and uh what he'll have is he'll have one of the loudest platforms
[2:51:41.200 --> 2:51:46.720]  in the world to fight back so this will put you know this was a good chess move by musk to counteract
[2:51:46.720 --> 2:51:52.800]  deep state efforts to derail his uh other economic agenda and it's great for free speech i mean
[2:51:53.680 --> 2:51:58.400]  we'll see if he delivers i mean that's the big open question can elon musk deliver on his
[2:51:58.400 --> 2:52:03.920]  returning twitter to its free speech origins but he's made very public promises to this effect
[2:52:03.920 --> 2:52:09.920]  he's taking the company private so almost its only purpose can be to restore its free speech
[2:52:09.920 --> 2:52:15.520]  origins and if you also changed its algorithms remember the most nefarious part of twitter
[2:52:15.520 --> 2:52:21.200]  isn't just its censorship it's that it algorithmically manipulates what topics it allows to trans
[2:52:21.200 --> 2:52:27.920]  shadow man total manipulation absolutely only that like i mean critics like me i'm a critic of our
[2:52:27.920 --> 2:52:31.920]  our involvement in the and getting involved i agree with trump we should stay the heck out of
[2:52:31.920 --> 2:52:37.840]  ukraine uh but i get bombarded with pro ukraine uh ukraine tweets of people's whose accounts i don't
[2:52:37.840 --> 2:52:42.560]  follow why because that's the algorithmic manipulation to emotionally manipulate the
[2:52:42.560 --> 2:52:47.360]  audience to a pre-ordained conclusion so it's not just the censorship it's the algorithmic
[2:52:47.360 --> 2:52:51.600]  manipulation which james oakieve and project veritas have helped detail and expose so let me
[2:52:51.600 --> 2:52:59.360]  ask you about this question how do we put loving pressure on elon musk to be true how do we back
[2:52:59.360 --> 2:53:03.120]  what he's doing because it was even if it's public stock it's going to triple now if it's
[2:53:03.120 --> 2:53:08.480]  private it's going to triple what do we do because i mean it'll be very disconcerting
[2:53:08.480 --> 2:53:12.000]  if he doesn't restore trump i'd love to hear alex jones that's great you're not to say that
[2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:16.720]  robert obviously the former president he needs to be reinstated instantly trump has shot his
[2:53:16.720 --> 2:53:21.120]  mouth off and said i won't even go back there well that's i think that's that's just not a smart
[2:53:21.120 --> 2:53:26.160]  statement well he hasn't gone to true social so this makes no sense to me true social which he
[2:53:26.160 --> 2:53:30.720]  has a proprietary interest in doesn't promote it he doesn't promote it he doesn't even post on it
[2:53:30.720 --> 2:53:36.800]  uh i think they they're their hearts in the right place but none of the links populate when you
[2:53:36.800 --> 2:53:41.040]  post that would turbo charge him he did that but there's a million people waiting in line so he
[2:53:41.040 --> 2:53:44.880]  raises billions of dollars and that doesn't promote what he built it makes no sense at all
[2:53:44.880 --> 2:53:50.480]  here's what i predict leftist like inderson cooper for example will now leave twitter wonderful
[2:53:50.480 --> 2:53:58.240]  zuckerberg soros and these other criminals will find a new quote unquote social media outlet
[2:53:58.240 --> 2:54:02.720]  from which they can take their news cues because robert's absolutely right this is about two things
[2:54:02.720 --> 2:54:07.840]  one everybody in government takes their cues from twitter so if they say alex jones is a fed
[2:54:07.840 --> 2:54:12.800]  oh alex jones must be a fed because i read it on twitter even though it's not true and then
[2:54:12.800 --> 2:54:20.000]  secondarily um this this is the way that they bully people in other words uh here's roger
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:24.880]  stone's address i mean they use it for doxing they use it for bullying uh and they really want
[2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:31.600]  the left will now move on to some other platform there will be no shortage of venture capital
[2:54:31.600 --> 2:54:37.200]  for a new completely censored and i'm good for them they could but yeah stupid though
[2:54:37.200 --> 2:54:42.880]  barns where's this going next this is huge uh if musk keeps his word it's a game changing event
[2:54:42.880 --> 2:54:47.040]  it's an absolutely game changing event because you have a platform with a massive audience
[2:54:47.600 --> 2:54:54.560]  that has massive reach and if it's back to being a free speech honest not only a free speech platform
[2:54:54.560 --> 2:54:59.600]  but no longer algorithmically manipulated to where you have an honest reflection of honest public
[2:54:59.600 --> 2:55:05.200]  opinion you're going to see back to what trump was in 2016 where twitter was an honest reflection
[2:55:05.200 --> 2:55:09.840]  of the fact of how popular trump was going to be before he even surged in the polls and even
[2:55:09.840 --> 2:55:14.400]  before he started dominating the primaries so you might get more honest reflection of public
[2:55:14.400 --> 2:55:18.320]  opinion their whole point was to take that reputation of an honest reflection of public
[2:55:18.320 --> 2:55:23.680]  opinion distort it through algorithmic manipulation create a fake impression of public opinion
[2:55:23.680 --> 2:55:27.520]  musk could completely reverse that just by restoring twitter to its origin that's right
[2:55:27.520 --> 2:55:34.400]  it's not it's not breaking though that uh twitter has accepted the deal so and again for me it's way
[2:55:34.400 --> 2:55:39.840]  better than twitter once there is economic freedom and and and other owners coming and knowing free
[2:55:39.840 --> 2:55:44.480]  speech is popular the market will take hold in free speech and it's game over and this whole
[2:55:44.480 --> 2:55:50.240]  reign of terror of cancel culture and censorship and all of it is going to come to a crashing end
[2:55:50.240 --> 2:55:54.640]  even if they try to build their own things no one wants to be there folks want the wall wall west
[2:55:54.640 --> 2:55:59.040]  so here's what i would like to see as soon as this transaction is complete i would like to see
[2:55:59.040 --> 2:56:04.800]  tucker carlsson interview elon musk about his intentions i think that would be perhaps the
[2:56:04.800 --> 2:56:10.000]  most watched beautiful tv show in american history there's no one better to conduct that
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:16.480]  incisive interview than tucker carlsson and we can find out whether musk who i like enormously
[2:56:16.480 --> 2:56:20.800]  and i think is in it because he believes in free speech he's not a conservative i have no illusions
[2:56:20.800 --> 2:56:25.120]  about that i think he's a libertarian i think he's a free thinker i happen to think the guy's
[2:56:25.120 --> 2:56:29.600]  going to keep his word i'd like tucker carlsson to conduct that first interview the bottom line is
[2:56:29.600 --> 2:56:36.640]  this we are in a very exciting time to be alive barns no doubt in fact another way elon musk could
[2:56:36.640 --> 2:56:42.560]  do it is announce once he's fully taken a private and is in control of the company do a four-person
[2:56:42.560 --> 2:56:47.840]  poet podcast with joe rogan alex jones and donald trump and sit down and announce to i mean that
[2:56:47.840 --> 2:56:52.320]  would be the most that would break the internet listen to podcast in history well i'll record
[2:56:52.320 --> 2:56:57.280]  on record i was told me i'm the hydrogen bomb so he's holding me back for some big point but
[2:56:57.280 --> 2:57:02.480]  there's some good stuff going on yeah i mean that would be dynamic that would that would get a lot
[2:57:02.480 --> 2:57:07.440]  of attention to twitter and reinvigorate it reinstate it but it would be good publicity for musk
[2:57:08.080 --> 2:57:13.520]  musk is clearly trying to establish more broader political protection against deep state apparatus
[2:57:13.520 --> 2:57:18.160]  exactly so is this let me do five or most of both of you and then we've got jones let's take it over
[2:57:18.160 --> 2:57:22.960]  is this the pendulum beginning to swing back we'll ask that question on the other side with

[3:00:15.440 --> 3:00:27.600]  all right robert barnes and roger stone with us final statements from both of you about this
[3:00:27.600 --> 3:00:35.200]  epic moment in time we're all sharing together with this amazing audience barnes it's no doubt it's
[3:00:35.200 --> 3:00:43.440]  a major game changer it is a because it's the reversal of an entire mantra of woke capitalism
[3:00:43.440 --> 3:00:49.920]  and censorship and algorithmic manipulation to help justify fake news narratives that good that
[3:00:49.920 --> 3:00:55.440]  spread and if this is the beginning of the reversal and it comes after desantis stood up to disney and
[3:00:55.440 --> 3:01:00.720]  disney stock collapsed it comes after netflix's stock collapsed after it went woke and decided
[3:01:00.720 --> 3:01:06.160]  to participate in a range of woke policies and politics now we have what used to be the free
[3:01:06.160 --> 3:01:11.280]  speech wing and the free speech party returning to the free speech wing and the free speech party
[3:01:11.280 --> 3:01:18.240]  and restoring free speech and algorithm free on its public discussion and discourse could restore
[3:01:18.240 --> 3:01:22.720]  key aspects of our democracy particularly in the news and information and that was beautiful as well
[3:01:22.720 --> 3:01:28.560]  they're trying to stamp out the trumps and the stones and the joneses there's this whole new
[3:01:28.560 --> 3:01:34.480]  burgeoning system waking up it's it's beautiful the the political implications of this are
[3:01:34.480 --> 3:01:40.400]  enormous in other words 2020 was the first election in which all mass communications of all types
[3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:47.120]  whether it was a network television cable news the internet print media was completely controlled
[3:01:47.120 --> 3:01:52.960]  that's never all in propaganda alignment and and therefore the implications of this for free and
[3:01:52.960 --> 3:01:59.920]  fair elections are enormous trump could never have been elected in 2016 without a free unfettered
[3:01:59.920 --> 3:02:08.480]  internet if we return to that in which the biggest and most important social media platform out there
[3:02:08.480 --> 3:02:14.240]  is once again unfettered and free and there is no censorship it has enormous implications
[3:02:14.240 --> 3:02:19.520]  for the america first movement that's right barns what do you think this is going how do they strike
[3:02:19.520 --> 3:02:25.200]  back though with with a successful takeover of twitter that was now being announced well it's
[3:02:25.200 --> 3:02:30.560]  a it's a critical battle that's reversing the war uh reversing the course of the war in terms of the
[3:02:30.560 --> 3:02:34.960]  battle against censorship the battle against this manipulation the battle against fake news the battle
[3:02:34.960 --> 3:02:41.040]  against this emotional manipulation of the masses the battle to restore american freedom in a manner
[3:02:41.040 --> 3:02:46.000]  that is as roger puts it unfettered and that is this is a great win for that those purposes that
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:51.040]  there's i mean the worst case scenario is twitter is the same twitter it's always been okay well
[3:02:51.040 --> 3:02:55.600]  that then that you know disappointing but that that doesn't make the world worse off best case
[3:02:55.600 --> 3:02:59.520]  scenario is twitter returns to being the free speech wing of the free speech party and then
[3:02:59.520 --> 3:03:06.240]  what happens honest news surges just like the audience of info wars managed to keep the sound
[3:03:06.240 --> 3:03:12.240]  of freedom and news of freedom alive if you had an honest twitter then the stories that would trend
[3:03:12.240 --> 3:03:17.440]  would be the same stories that dominate the audience in info wars and so that's what we would
[3:03:17.440 --> 3:03:23.040]  start to see we would see a restoration of honest news honest information honest debate
[3:03:23.040 --> 3:03:27.760]  honest discourse and that's good for freedom and liberty because in an honest debate freedom and
[3:03:27.760 --> 3:03:32.960]  liberty wins every single time and let me make the announcement now breaking twitter has been
[3:03:32.960 --> 3:03:39.440]  sold to elon musk and will go private after agreeing to a deal worth 44 billion dollars so we are here
[3:03:39.440 --> 3:03:44.320]  today roger hasn't been here in two and a half years in studio it's magic that you're here roger
[3:03:44.320 --> 3:03:49.840]  while this is happening and you know what this proves money talks and bullshit walks i mean in
[3:03:49.840 --> 3:03:55.200]  the end he made a financial offer that they couldn't refuse and that actually overcame their
[3:03:55.200 --> 3:04:01.920]  wokeness because remember the opposition to doing this deal and then twitter folded in the face of
[3:04:01.920 --> 3:04:08.480]  an extraordinarily audacious offer by elon musk so it's a historic moment it can be a domino that
[3:04:08.480 --> 3:04:13.760]  affects everything this is really incredible robert barnes thank you so much for being with us on this
[3:04:13.760 --> 3:04:19.520]  really amazing historic broadcast we'll talk to you again very very soon my friend absolutely and
[3:04:19.520 --> 3:04:24.240]  thanks to the audience out there that helped keep info wars alive because that was key and critical
[3:04:24.240 --> 3:04:29.200]  to something like this even happening elon musk isn't interested in this unless the info wars
[3:04:29.200 --> 3:04:34.240]  audience keeps networks like info wars alive to show elon musk the demand for free speech is there
[3:04:34.240 --> 3:04:39.920]  and always has been the pendulum must swing back the question is win and how hard thank you so much

[3:06:13.040 --> 3:06:30.640]  the term bread and circuses comes from an ancient roman poet describing how the people are governed
[3:06:31.280 --> 3:06:38.160]  not by excellence in public service but by food and distractions like a herd of livestock
[3:06:38.160 --> 3:06:45.920]  today's circuses can be found on twitter a reflection of the human herd's short
[3:06:45.920 --> 3:06:53.040]  attention span meaningless distractions to keep everyone calm while their food supply is being
[3:06:53.040 --> 3:07:00.240]  destroyed while fools joke about biden doing a horrible job his administration is doing such
[3:07:00.240 --> 3:07:06.480]  an efficient job of destroying america that anyone running in 2024 if there is an election
[3:07:06.480 --> 3:07:12.400]  will have to run on the build back better platform starvation has been used as a weapon of mass
[3:07:12.400 --> 3:07:19.360]  destruction for years in just a two-year period stalin's communist government murdered over three
[3:07:19.360 --> 3:07:27.120]  million people in ukraine by simply pulling the strings of bureaucracy sanctions the ethiopian
[3:07:27.120 --> 3:07:35.120]  counter insurgency burned crops and food stores eerily bombed food markets and restricted trade
[3:07:35.120 --> 3:07:40.720]  they then began a resettlement plan that killed at least 80 000 people with further starvation
[3:07:41.680 --> 3:07:47.840]  the u.s. state department murdered over half a million women and children in iraq with starvation
[3:07:47.840 --> 3:07:54.720]  by sanctions and this is exactly what is happening in america today the biden administration
[3:07:54.720 --> 3:08:00.720]  sanctions against russia are only succeeding at killing more innocent people all over the world
[3:08:00.720 --> 3:08:06.080]  by dramatically cutting down the worldwide food supply there is already a significant
[3:08:06.080 --> 3:08:12.160]  wheat fuel and fertilizer shortage which is obviously going to affect everything else
[3:08:12.880 --> 3:08:19.040]  starting with fresh produce and livestock but in order to completely collapse the food economy
[3:08:19.040 --> 3:08:24.160]  they'll have to start destroying food packing plants as well so that there is nothing left on
[3:08:24.160 --> 3:08:31.440]  the shelves for you to eat there have been confirmed over a dozen disabling accidents at food plants
[3:08:31.440 --> 3:08:37.280]  in the last month over a dozen absolutely and we're talking about some really significant
[3:08:37.280 --> 3:08:42.560]  plants the taylor farms facility in salinas california was completely destroyed by a fire
[3:08:42.560 --> 3:08:48.560]  last week we've had two major potato processing plants in belfast main and warden washington
[3:08:48.560 --> 3:08:53.040]  that were completely gutted which is happening at a time where we already have a potato shortage
[3:08:53.040 --> 3:08:58.800]  globally you were talking about the onion supply at that real fresh but it's not just produce plants
[3:08:58.800 --> 3:09:04.800]  last month there was a fire that took out a nestle food plant out in jonesboro arkansas
[3:09:04.800 --> 3:09:10.000]  and that's impacting frozen food brands like hot pockets or stofers which maybe you might buy if
[3:09:10.000 --> 3:09:15.840]  you can't get fresh food from a warehouse that just exploded those still satiated with their
[3:09:15.840 --> 3:09:22.640]  bread and circuses are soon going to start getting hungry and it's because america is under siege
[3:09:22.640 --> 3:09:28.400]  being destroyed from within by a corrupt government while the people seek fairness on twitter
[3:09:29.680 --> 3:09:32.160]  reporting for info wars this is greg reese

[3:11:58.640 --> 3:12:07.440]  and that's why we're asking everybody to realize that what you do now is the most important
[3:12:08.160 --> 3:12:18.080]  actions ever in the info war once we get to this crescendo once we get to this point in time
[3:12:18.880 --> 3:12:26.000]  that we're at everything we do during this period is just as important as everything else

[3:34:23.600 --> 3:34:31.360]  vaccinated but no it's higher than that because they say 66 of americans have been vaccinated
[3:34:32.560 --> 3:34:37.680]  as you put probably the real number in there it's probably more like 40 have been vaccinated
[3:34:40.000 --> 3:34:47.040]  yeah online disinformation puts democracy what democracy democracy
[3:34:47.040 --> 3:34:56.480]  hey hey hey idiot hey arrogant arrogant obama there's no such thing as anybody saying what

[3:36:07.520 --> 3:36:16.720]  again as i said over and over again napoleon sent 420 000 troops out of poland to attack
[3:36:16.720 --> 3:36:24.880]  moscow came back with 10 000 got it well maybe that number is too hard for you to understand so we'll do
[3:36:24.880 --> 3:36:37.280]  another one hitler kills between what 23 to 27 million russians in world war two and who's the

[3:36:57.200 --> 3:37:04.880]  over and over again it's here in your trends journal we did major stories on it as it was
[3:37:04.880 --> 3:37:11.760]  happening back in 2014 when the united states overthrew the democratically elected government
[3:37:12.320 --> 3:37:23.040]  of viktor yana kovic and then we just did a poll the salenti poll on the on twitter
[3:37:23.040 --> 3:37:34.960]  who will win the ukrain war all right you ready for this blinkin 76 percent
[3:37:35.600 --> 3:37:45.600]  this is a voter two thousand two thousand people voted 76 percent said russia
[3:37:45.600 --> 3:37:52.160]  nine point six percent
[3:37:52.160 --> 3:38:10.640]  that people calling it a draw then
[3:38:10.640 --> 3:38:21.760]  saying that ukraine could win and what's the united states doing sending more weapons to kill
[3:38:24.320 --> 3:38:25.360]  this is terrible
[3:38:28.080 --> 3:38:35.520]  just more ammunition could you imagine wherever you're living having to leave your home
[3:38:35.520 --> 3:38:41.920]  leave everything you have behind you because you're escaping for your life
[3:38:44.800 --> 3:38:49.840]  because they're keeping a losing war going and as he said
[3:38:52.160 --> 3:38:59.360]  they want to weaken russia let me get this straight what's going on between russia and
[3:38:59.360 --> 3:39:06.240]  ukraine's been going on for centuries this is not my business as an american
[3:39:07.520 --> 3:39:16.080]  it is nobody's business but their own ain't nobody's business it ain't nobody's business but their own
[3:39:17.920 --> 3:39:25.280]  this is not the united states and arrogant arrogant clowns like him the murderer bush
[3:39:25.280 --> 3:39:32.400]  the murderer obama the murderer clinton all the wars that you guys started that you don't have
[3:39:32.400 --> 3:39:42.800]  the cojones to go fighting all you do is spew out your murderous garbage you haven't won one yet
[3:39:44.880 --> 3:39:51.440]  show me one thing the federal government has done at any level that has helped us as human beings
[3:39:51.440 --> 3:39:57.200]  this country is going down the toilet
[3:39:59.520 --> 3:40:02.560]  and a bunch of crap heads are flushing us down
[3:40:05.600 --> 3:40:06.720]  all losers
[3:40:06.720 --> 3:40:22.800]  it has never been a better time to unite than now ever never ever in my lifetime
[3:40:25.280 --> 3:40:29.520]  it does not take a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority
[3:40:30.160 --> 3:40:35.680]  keen on setting brush fires and freedom in minds of men says samuel adams and now is that time
[3:40:35.680 --> 3:40:45.360]  to unite we can beat them i say it's 40 percent against 60 percent 40 percent of us are true americans
[3:40:46.640 --> 3:40:54.480]  everybody that's listening to info was your heart is there as a soul of america freedom peace and

[3:41:38.800 --> 3:41:44.720]  is a big one all the markets across europe down between 1.5 and 2 percent
[3:41:44.720 --> 3:41:49.360]  they're artificially propping up our markets to keep them from going down
[3:41:51.440 --> 3:41:56.000]  again we write about it in detail in the trends journal if you go to my website here we go
[3:41:56.960 --> 3:42:04.080]  great of chinese market losses with shenzhen stocks falling six percent oil slides three percent

[3:42:45.040 --> 3:42:50.080]  know history before it happens to subscribe to the trends journal we've been shanghai
[3:42:56.480 --> 3:43:00.880]  it was about 25 years ago that i wanted to expand info wars i've been on the air a couple of years
[3:43:00.880 --> 3:43:06.160]  but i only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show i wanted to hire camera
[3:43:06.160 --> 3:43:10.720]  people i wanted to make films i wanted to really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt i
[3:43:10.720 --> 3:43:16.880]  designed the first one mass murderers agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring the
[3:43:16.880 --> 3:43:21.760]  first two members of my crew that's our oldest design and he's still selling we have that design
[3:43:21.760 --> 3:43:27.040]  over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions because whatever stock we've got in that's
[3:43:27.040 --> 3:43:32.560]  that we're selling everything out to fund the operation to get rid of inventory we'll still

[3:43:55.680 --> 3:44:00.160]  mike in california thanks for calling i think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain
[3:44:00.160 --> 3:44:05.920]  of function research now if you read the actual you know 2014 legislation the us government gain
[3:44:05.920 --> 3:44:11.920]  of function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research
[3:44:11.920 --> 3:44:17.360]  involving influenza mers and dars viruses there's nothing about stars like viruses and it's a
[3:44:17.360 --> 3:44:22.160]  research funding pause it's not a stop it's not a prohibition it's when you come to a four-way
[3:44:22.160 --> 3:44:26.640]  intersection there's the stop sign you stop you look both ways and then you proceed and so it's
[3:44:26.640 --> 3:44:31.600]  also it doesn't pause all gain of function just selected gain of function but they'll argue that
[3:44:31.600 --> 3:44:37.360]  this is actually characterization and qualification research so you know rand and others you know maybe
[3:44:37.360 --> 3:44:40.960]  fouchy was right they don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function you
[3:44:40.960 --> 3:44:44.880]  know that's why he didn't perjure himself that's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally
[3:44:44.880 --> 3:44:50.000]  creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do but in the main definition it's still
[3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:54.480]  a gain of function you're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people thank you
[3:44:54.480 --> 3:45:03.120]  mike we love you over the years info wars is produced more than 200 amazing patriot americana

[3:48:29.280 --> 3:48:35.040]  with ukraine we won't do anything with nato we won't expand any one inch further we'll won't
[3:48:35.040 --> 3:48:46.880]  backtrack on what we said but now they didn't do that you know the hypocrisy of the media sudan
[3:48:47.440 --> 3:48:51.440]  what's a sudan oh maybe it's like a yemen i never heard of one but oh well anyway
[3:48:52.480 --> 3:48:59.600]  tribal clashes in sudan they call them tribal clashes between arabes and non-arabes in sudan
[3:48:59.600 --> 3:49:05.920]  and war ravaged are for a region have killed your
[3:49:05.920 --> 3:49:22.880]  man and uh we did hundreds more at least in the worst case you're right
[3:49:22.880 --> 3:49:38.080]  yeah so now this war going on sudan 168 people killed how come they don't report that in the
[3:49:38.080 --> 3:49:48.320]  media did they did they kill 168 civilians today in ukraine no well who cares about a yemen who
[3:49:48.320 --> 3:50:00.160]  cares about a a sudan no no no ethiopia wait no don't care don't care at all we'll only keep selling
[3:50:00.720 --> 3:50:06.880]  the fear and hysteria to hate the russians and again anybody thinks that they could go beat the
[3:50:06.880 --> 3:50:14.400]  russians you're out of your mind you're not going to beat them this war has been going on
[3:50:14.400 --> 3:50:24.880]  why eight weeks america couldn't beat the taliban about 80 000 90 000 of them in 20 years
[3:50:29.280 --> 3:50:33.520]  i talked about cnn and it's going to be in this new trends journal and when it goes out tomorrow
[3:50:34.480 --> 3:50:42.480]  cnn plus crashes at launch public won't swallow cartoon news crap that's cnn cartoon news network
[3:50:42.480 --> 3:50:53.440]  and um i go on for the trend forecast because we go on to say how people this disgusted with
[3:50:53.440 --> 3:51:02.560]  this stupid junk the trend forecast the time is now for a true print and broadcast media
[3:51:03.200 --> 3:51:11.280]  that only sells hard facts data and truth you know as does the trends journal of course and
[3:51:11.280 --> 3:51:21.120]  infowars rather than being so lame and egotistical to sell their agendas and belief systems as
[3:51:24.960 --> 3:51:34.640]  needs this is time for the public to be well informed so the population may rise to higher
[3:51:34.640 --> 3:51:44.640]  levels rather than propagandized by those heading the world into mass destruction of body mind and
[3:51:44.640 --> 3:51:55.760]  spirit and that's where we are it's the mass destruction of the human spirit look how low
[3:51:55.760 --> 3:52:06.640]  we've gone look at the stuff that people eat oh you go to poppies no i like mcdonald's yeah
[3:52:08.480 --> 3:52:16.160]  one junk food junk junk junk junk junk food equals junk brains
[3:52:16.160 --> 3:52:25.440]  and that's it that's what we become the followers
[3:52:31.280 --> 3:52:36.240]  these are critical times as i said you know what's going on now with this oil
[3:52:37.120 --> 3:52:38.960]  oil plunging the way it did today
[3:52:38.960 --> 3:52:48.240]  down over five dollars a barrel for Brent crude because what's going on in china
[3:52:50.720 --> 3:52:55.600]  locking down one province after another and i read the numbers they're in the papers
[3:52:56.400 --> 3:53:00.800]  65 cases about 65 cases out of 40 million
[3:53:00.800 --> 3:53:06.400]  wait what are you talking about in cases don't equal deaths

[3:53:36.960 --> 3:53:54.240]  the black box one after another moving into china pulling out of hong kong
[3:53:56.480 --> 3:53:56.800]  yeah

[3:54:09.120 --> 3:54:21.520]  new cases five symptoms total cases 197 nothing nothing it's a power trip
[3:54:23.280 --> 3:54:28.320]  and they robbed us of our power with the war on terror they robbed us of our freedom
[3:54:28.320 --> 3:54:34.880]  young people have no idea what it used to be like to fly used to be fun now you got them
[3:54:34.880 --> 3:54:41.280]  feeling up as you will go on in there if you don't want to get radiated and what have they

[3:55:20.560 --> 3:55:27.440]  so don't support info wars don't subscribe to the trends journal instead you could go to the
