[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:06.150]  In Canada, they haven't just declared their emergency, they haven't just declared now it's permanent.
[00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:15.713]  The Parliament retroactively, by a narrow margin, voted it into law, giving themselves dictatorial powers yesterday, declaring themselves an elected dictatorship.
[00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:18.893]  Because you can be elected and then declare yourself dictatorial powers.
[00:00:19.314 --> 00:00:25.215]  And so, the headline for the show today is, Canada has declared itself a dictatorship.
[00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.988]  Canadian government officially declares itself a dictatorship.
[00:00:30.168 --> 00:00:34.231]  There's no rhetoric there, there's no exaggeration there, there's no embellishment there.
[00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:38.233]  I am physically almost vomiting right now.
[00:00:38.293 --> 00:00:44.917]  I'm so upset I could barely... and I'm not being dramatic here, this is such a blow to our children's futures, to everybody.
[00:00:44.937 --> 00:00:51.101]  This is so horrible, this is run by Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, that I physically am almost vomiting right now.
[00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:56.903]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:05.807]  Today begins the return of Pluto.
[00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.549]  The last time it happened was on July 4th, 1776.
[00:01:10.408 --> 00:01:28.607]   4th 1776. Today is Tuesday February 22nd 2022. Today is 2 2 2 2 0 2 2
[00:01:26.874 --> 00:01:31.376]  2 times 2 times 2 times 2-2-2 equals 1776.
[00:01:34.377 --> 00:01:35.437]  But then it gets more interesting.
[00:01:35.457 --> 00:01:42.819]  2-2-2-2-2 is the first time Pluto is in conjunct the United States since July 4th, 1776.
[00:01:42.798 --> 00:01:53.118]   4th 1776, a 248 year event known as Pluto's return. Pluto of course is the
[00:01:53.118 --> 00:01:58.518]   god of the underworld in the Roman system and signifies death and
[00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:03.278]  destruction but also then rebirth.
[00:02:03.896 --> 00:02:06.417]  It begins today and lasts for two years.
[00:02:08.218 --> 00:02:18.683]  Gregg Reese is doing a report on this, and you may not believe in the stars, you may not believe in numerology, but the people that run the planet live by it.
[00:02:19.682 --> 00:02:24.606]  Make no mistake, Putin invaded on the eve of the return of Pluto.
[00:02:25.607 --> 00:02:31.833]  The Romans would go to war when Pluto was in certain types of aspects, and when Mars was.
[00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:35.316]  So would many other ancient cultures, including the Egyptians.
[00:02:35.936 --> 00:02:40.040]  And these people have passed down their secret archaic incantations.
[00:02:41.781 --> 00:03:03.319]   Putin obviously knows who runs the New World Order, and it's a major, major message To them, make no mistake, our founders were aware of this knowledge, and they launched their rebellion and the founding of their new world, or their new Atlantis, that Francis Bacon and others envisioned hundreds of years before.
[00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.319]  1776.
[00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.280]  That was launched on July 4th, 1776.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.880]  that was launched on July 4th, 1776.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.880]  That is 1776 today.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.880]  Two times two times two times two two two.
[00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.971]  And yeah, a lot of schizophrenics and nuts then obsess over other numerology and find things that aren't there.
[00:03:25.011 --> 00:03:28.754]  But this is one of the biggest numerological dates there is.
[00:03:30.454 --> 00:03:32.856]  And you notice all hell's breaking loose right now.
[00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:35.936]  Now, what came first, the chicken or the egg?
[00:03:35.936 --> 00:03:42.936]  Think about that.
[00:03:43.862 --> 00:03:45.323]  And of course, you know, they both come together.
[00:03:46.277 --> 00:03:51.761]  For whatever reason this goes on, it's real in that we manifest it on these dates.
[00:03:54.043 --> 00:03:55.584]  Why do humans do that psychologically?
[00:03:55.744 --> 00:03:58.847]  Or is there a secret code to all of this?
[00:03:59.727 --> 00:04:07.994]  And is it the code of the universe where we're able to see the Creator's actions and then humans try to understand it and try to mimic that?
[00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:15.629]   by first gauging the stars and making key decisions about the alignment of those planets
[00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:23.568]  they called stars or gods.
[00:04:23.568 --> 00:04:27.109]   Every day now that we host, I say it's a very important day because things are getting so
[00:04:27.109 --> 00:04:33.468]  intense, but today was particularly bad on a lot of fronts.
[00:04:33.468 --> 00:04:43.469]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:04:35.128 --> 00:04:43.694]  When I read this and I saw this and I went and researched it, it was like being punched in the stomach because of what it signifies and what it means.
[00:04:44.255 --> 00:04:57.585]  We know the same globalists that run Biden and the Justice Department and the FBI that declared all protesting of lockdowns terrorism that I've been harping on since he put it in that report back in June of last year made the official policy of the U.S.
[00:04:57.625 --> 00:05:04.150]  government to use the military, CIA, and others on anyone protesting lockdowns in the future, which is martial law.
[00:05:05.196 --> 00:05:06.577]  But they'd be treated as terrorists.
[00:05:08.717 --> 00:05:18.721]  And we know that Canada is following the exact same script and is under the same field marshal's command, Klaus Schwab, and his adjuncts and aides.
[00:05:20.082 --> 00:05:23.243]  And so they announced it today.
[00:05:24.944 --> 00:05:27.425]  North Korea level martial law in Canada, permanent.
[00:05:29.312 --> 00:05:35.496]  No bail, and then 10 years in prison for any form of conservative protesting, including all peaceful protesting.
[00:05:36.676 --> 00:05:51.405]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is February 22nd, 2022, known as the return of Pluto, the high holy day of a cultist for over 6,000 years to launch major wars.
[00:05:52.426 --> 00:05:54.328]  That is in mainline history books.
[00:05:54.368 --> 00:06:01.476]  Of course, our founders, knowing that, launched their own new system on 1776, July 4th.
[00:06:02.337 --> 00:06:03.718]  Today, Tuesday, is 2-2-2-2-0-2-2.
[00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:05.180]  2 times 2 times 2 times 2-2-2 equals 1776.
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:11.560]   2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 equals 1776. 22222 is the first time
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:20.220]  Pluto is conjunct the United States since July 4th 1776.
[00:06:19.162 --> 00:06:22.625]  A 248 year event known as Pluto's Return.
[00:06:23.206 --> 00:06:25.248]  Pluto symbolizes destruction and rebirth.
[00:06:25.668 --> 00:06:27.730]  It begins today and lasts for two years.
[00:06:28.351 --> 00:06:31.053]  Whether you believe in that or not, the globalists and elites do.
[00:06:31.093 --> 00:06:32.634]  You can study history on that.
[00:06:32.654 --> 00:06:34.396]  We'll be getting into some of that today.
[00:06:35.877 --> 00:06:37.639]  It's also Washington's birthday.
[00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.502]  Before they changed over to the new modern calendar, his birthday was February 11th.
[00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:46.781]  1732, but now it's February 22nd, 1732 as well.
[00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:52.123]  Are folks starting to figure out all these dates and why they're so important?
[00:06:52.143 --> 00:06:59.206]  Starting to see the coincidences that are not coincidences, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:59.346 --> 00:07:01.547]  As it was before, it will so be now.
[00:07:02.208 --> 00:07:05.149]  History doesn't just rhyme, it repeats.
[00:07:06.713 --> 00:07:28.045]  So, call it a glitch in the matrix, call it what you will, folks have been noticing it for a long time, and powerful elites throughout history operate basically off of what you could call a complex form of astrology based on numerology, from the Egyptians, the ancient Chinese, right through to today.
[00:07:30.346 --> 00:07:35.789]  Obviously, we've got the massive Russian news, we've got huge COVID news, we've got just so much here.
[00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:47.911]  But the first thing I want to hit today is just is just unbelievable.
[00:07:48.731 --> 00:07:51.572]  But then you realize it's not unbelievable.
[00:07:52.952 --> 00:07:56.333]  It was all so predictable.
[00:07:58.153 --> 00:08:00.034]  And it's exactly the path we would go on.
[00:08:00.894 --> 00:08:11.942]   But when you think about Venezuela, or you think about communist China or Cuba or Nazi Germany or the old Soviet Union, Or old tyrannies throughout history.
[00:08:12.562 --> 00:08:13.643]  What do you think about?
[00:08:13.943 --> 00:08:20.628]  Well, if you peacefully protest, you get held without bail, and then you face 10 years in prison.
[00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:28.935]  In the old Soviet Union, your first visit to a gulag was two years, then you got 10 years, and then you got a bullet in the back of your head.
[00:08:30.876 --> 00:08:33.838]  Two years, 10 years, bullet back in the head.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:42.408]   In Canada, They haven't just declared their emergency, they haven't just declared now it's permanent.
[00:08:42.868 --> 00:08:51.955]  The Parliament retroactively, by a narrow margin, voted it into law, giving themselves dictatorial powers yesterday, declaring themselves an elected dictatorship.
[00:08:51.975 --> 00:08:55.157]  Because you can be elected and then declare yourself dictatorial powers.
[00:08:55.577 --> 00:09:01.461]  And so, the headline for the show today is, Canada has declared itself a dictatorship.
[00:09:03.112 --> 00:09:06.234]  Canadian government officially declares itself a dictatorship.
[00:09:06.414 --> 00:09:07.675]  There's no rhetoric there.
[00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:09.256]  There's no exaggeration there.
[00:09:09.296 --> 00:09:10.477]  There's no embellishment there.
[00:09:11.137 --> 00:09:14.499]  I am physically almost vomiting right now.
[00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:15.180]  I'm so upset.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.161]  I could barely... And I'm not being dramatic here.
[00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:21.163]  This is such a blow to our children's futures, to everybody.
[00:09:21.203 --> 00:09:22.204]  This is so horrible.
[00:09:22.464 --> 00:09:27.387]  This is run by Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates that I physically am almost vomiting right now.
[00:09:27.807 --> 00:09:28.608]  My mouth is watering.
[00:09:29.892 --> 00:09:31.313]  Like, I almost just left today.
[00:09:31.433 --> 00:09:37.539]  I mean, seriously, because how do you even get on air and just talk about this like it's the latest thing that's happening, and then we just move on to the next thing?
[00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:48.429]  Oh, public schools have got elementary school girls without the parents being known, when they go to summer camps and science camps, there's biological 25, 30-year-old men sleeping with them in the bunks.
[00:09:49.765 --> 00:09:53.147]  And that hissing voice of Trudeau, I can't even listen to it.
[00:09:52.986 --> 00:09:57.865]   it's martial law in Canada. It's just they do whatever they want, however they
[00:09:57.865 --> 00:10:02.925]   want, whenever they want with behavioral psychology. And that hissing voice of
[00:10:02.925 --> 00:10:10.266]  Trudeau, I can't even listen to it. So folks, it gets worse.
[00:10:08.853 --> 00:10:18.336]  The Democratic Party's run by the same people, and there's national polls out saying, yes, seize the bank accounts of anyone that protests lockdowns in the US, Canada, or anywhere.
[00:10:18.796 --> 00:10:22.056]  Take their children, put them in prison, and it's being done.
[00:10:23.217 --> 00:10:32.559]  And what you see Biden putting in, first press conference Psaki gave on the 21st last year of January.
[00:10:34.339 --> 00:10:41.923]   I decided to take my wife, And children on a late vacation.
[00:10:43.363 --> 00:10:46.004]  And we went to Utah to go skiing.
[00:10:46.904 --> 00:10:50.986]  And I remember sitting there in the hot tub, watching her press conference.
[00:10:52.837 --> 00:10:58.682]  And at the pool out there in the snow and her announcing, we're going to declare people that protest terrorists.
[00:10:58.702 --> 00:11:02.124]  We're going to declare people that protest lockdowns terrorists.
[00:11:02.184 --> 00:11:13.093]  And then months later in June, they made it the US government policy and directive that the main threats, not China, not MS-13, not radical Islam, but the American people.
[00:11:13.793 --> 00:11:14.554]  Then they put it up on TV.
[00:11:16.112 --> 00:11:22.057]  Potential terror threats, opposition to COVID measures, claims of election fraud, belief Trump can be reinstated.
[00:11:22.097 --> 00:11:23.998]  That was on NBC News, Fox News, you name it.
[00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:26.220]  That was in June.
[00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:30.043]  And it's the same all over Europe and Australia.
[00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:34.546]  And now they've done it.
[00:11:37.248 --> 00:11:55.094]   They have announced that Hundreds of people they arrested, including the two organizers, who are totally peaceful, are going to be held for up to a year until trial without bond.
[00:11:55.954 --> 00:12:09.680]  And they face 10 years in prison for peacefully saying, we don't want you to put something experimental on our body for us people to have a job or leave our house or go to the grocery store.
[00:12:11.075 --> 00:12:13.175]  I mean, this on a scale of one to ten, this is a ten.
[00:12:14.576 --> 00:12:17.296]  And by the way, these are classical liberals, the people that organized it.
[00:12:17.316 --> 00:12:20.417]  A lot of folks didn't trust them because of that, but they were good old-fashioned liberals.
[00:12:20.897 --> 00:12:22.177]  They thought they'd just be let out of jail.
[00:12:22.197 --> 00:12:22.977]  They'd been arrested before.
[00:12:23.337 --> 00:12:25.298]  Oh, sorry, sweetheart.
[00:12:25.698 --> 00:12:29.899]  You got arrested for actually standing up against the New World Order takeover.
[00:12:30.319 --> 00:12:31.579]  The left gets to protest.
[00:12:31.599 --> 00:12:33.479]  The left gets to burn stuff down and shoot cops.
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.980]  You go to prison.
[00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.775]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is beyond dangerous.
[00:12:40.654 --> 00:12:51.975]   If you don't feel physically threatened by this, if you don't feel nauseous, then something's
[00:12:51.975 --> 00:12:58.213]  wrong with you.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.700]  Let me read this to you.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.981]  This is just, this is just, this is the next level.
[00:13:02.521 --> 00:13:03.821]  This is, we're coming for everybody.
[00:13:04.042 --> 00:13:05.042]  Hell, they're trying to cook up stuff.
[00:13:06.033 --> 00:13:07.113]  On me right now to put me in prison.
[00:13:07.133 --> 00:13:08.134]  They've got Owen indicted.
[00:13:08.174 --> 00:13:11.395]  They've got Sam Montoya, did nothing wrong, indicted for being at the Capitol.
[00:13:11.635 --> 00:13:14.696]  They have a CNN special Sunday night, all about how I need to be arrested.
[00:13:14.716 --> 00:13:16.216]  Tell you about that later.
[00:13:16.936 --> 00:13:17.637]  A bunch of lies.
[00:13:18.317 --> 00:13:21.918]  I mean, they are criminalizing dissent because it's a global corporate takeover.
[00:13:23.318 --> 00:13:28.440]  Freedom Convoy protester organizer, Tamara Lich, denied bail.
[00:13:29.409 --> 00:13:41.892]  Today, an Ontario court judge issued the decision in Ottawa saying she believed, okay it's always a female judge isn't it, there was a substantial chance Litch would re-offend if released.
[00:13:42.472 --> 00:13:50.874]  Litch promised to go back to her state and they said no, you will be held without bail.
[00:13:50.994 --> 00:13:52.214]  So did the other organizers.
[00:13:53.914 --> 00:14:14.493]  So for peacefully demonstrating and peacefully organizing, they've already grabbed the 10 million they raised and stole it, so that they can't fight for that money on the outside, so they can't run a political movement in that country, just like in the old Soviet Union or Nazi Germany, except there they didn't have television where you got arrested publicly, she's being disappeared into a black hole until they break her.
[00:14:17.916 --> 00:14:18.977]  And the judge even said that.
[00:14:20.029 --> 00:14:23.730]  They said, you have said that you will not protest anymore.
[00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:24.170]  Wow!
[00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:25.490]  Under threat of prison.
[00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.471]  But you won't admit you're bad and your movement is bad.
[00:14:29.811 --> 00:14:31.191]  So because you won't do what we want.
[00:14:31.211 --> 00:14:37.733]  Remember we always heard about North Vietnam, they'd shoot down our pilots and torture them a few years, until they would say America was bad and everybody knew that was the worst thing you could do?
[00:14:38.333 --> 00:14:39.813]  That's what they do to the January 6th people.
[00:14:40.653 --> 00:14:50.178]   They hold them until they'll come out and say, That Trump's bad, America's bad, that the election wasn't stolen, and that, you know, bear false witness.
[00:14:50.218 --> 00:14:54.080]  I mean, this is classic fascist authoritarian communist tactics.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.361]  I mean, this is as bad as it gets.
[00:14:57.041 --> 00:15:00.202]  And it's about to get a lot worse on a wider scale.
[00:15:01.043 --> 00:15:03.464]  But they're already beta testing it as worse as it gets.
[00:15:03.844 --> 00:15:04.264]  Stay with us.
[00:15:05.265 --> 00:15:09.747]  Since I was a child, I made a study of history.
[00:15:11.047 --> 00:15:12.308]  I just happened to start reading.
[00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:21.807]  Some of the military encyclopedias that were laying around the house when I was about five.
[00:15:23.108 --> 00:15:32.755]  By 10, I was reading PhD level books about World War II and World War I and Rome and Greece and Soviet Union.
[00:15:33.455 --> 00:15:36.137]  I was reading Zbigniew Brzezinski between two ages by the time I was 12.
[00:15:36.177 --> 00:15:38.898]  The mind of Adolf Hitler by the time I was 13.
[00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:40.880]  Mein Kampf.
[00:15:42.332 --> 00:15:44.714]  The History of the English-Speaking Peoples by Winston Churchill.
[00:15:45.094 --> 00:15:47.495]  I've read thousands of books.
[00:15:49.537 --> 00:16:02.586]  And when you know what tyranny looks like from history books and you've seen it in your life grow slowly, it's very nauseating, very disgusting to realize that it's only going to get worse.
[00:16:03.906 --> 00:16:13.585]   And we're going to have to decide whether we're going to submit to it and go under its full control when That's a fate worse than death?
[00:16:15.366 --> 00:16:18.347]  This particular group is as nasty as anything anyone's ever imagined?
[00:16:20.427 --> 00:16:28.849]  Or whether we're going to resist it, but do that in a way that doesn't aid the evil ones to bring in the full-fledged civil war they want?
[00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:40.230]   But I got to tell you folks, the private global corporations through the Davos Group are getting
[00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:46.590]   their directives from a private corporate consortium of intelligence agencies that are
[00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:54.030]   transhumanist and that are bringing in a post-human world and an artificial collapse that they
[00:16:54.030 --> 00:17:00.630]   will blame on global warming and the rest of it to depopulate 80 to 90 percent of the
[00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.990]  population by the year 2030 is their public plan.
[00:17:04.507 --> 00:17:16.375]  And so you can imagine how they're going to get us there in eight years, and how life and death this is, and how great it is that people are waking up about the Great Reset, and it's the hottest thing out there, and folks are really getting it right now.
[00:17:17.175 --> 00:17:18.156]  Thank God for all of you.
[00:17:18.236 --> 00:17:19.897]  You are beyond the tip of the spear.
[00:17:20.778 --> 00:17:21.658]  You are the vanguard.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:38.512]   But when you see In Australia, in New Zealand, in Germany, in Austria, in Scotland, in Ireland it's happening, in Canada and in blue cities, and in D.C.
[00:17:40.513 --> 00:17:49.556]  Thousands of people arrested including mothers and fathers and young people and children beat up and women rode over with horses on purpose.
[00:17:49.596 --> 00:17:55.739]  I mean you see it in Europe and in Australia where they see a woman in a field and they just run her over with a Clydesdale.
[00:17:56.661 --> 00:17:58.141]  Stuff way worse than what you saw in Canada.
[00:17:59.902 --> 00:18:06.103]  And gangs of leftist police beating up folks that don't abide by the lockdowns.
[00:18:07.964 --> 00:18:19.186]  When you see that, you have to understand that's all directed by the globalists and the plan they have for Canada and Australia is the plan they're rolling out here.
[00:18:19.486 --> 00:18:21.967]  And Senator Paul came out and warned of that today.
[00:18:25.462 --> 00:18:31.247]  So we are all in grave, grave, grave, grave danger.
[00:18:34.249 --> 00:18:37.391]  And this is the designed, controlled collapse of society.
[00:18:38.432 --> 00:18:43.876]  And the foolish police that go along with it, and the foolish leftists that go along with it, they're destroying their own future.
[00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:54.024]  But all the big money has got its private jets fueled up and ready, and they got bunkers and underground bases all over the world.
[00:18:56.371 --> 00:19:00.913]  And they plan at the end of this to reemerge and build this quote, beautiful utopia.
[00:19:03.975 --> 00:19:06.156]  Once they've killed 80, 90% of the population.
[00:19:08.116 --> 00:19:10.858]  And they've got the plan all laid out and how they're going to do it.
[00:19:14.159 --> 00:19:15.840]  And we said this was coming.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.641]  We said Trudeau declared himself a dictator.
[00:19:17.661 --> 00:19:18.521]  He said he wanted to be one.
[00:19:20.102 --> 00:19:22.203]  Klaus Schwab said he's the model of the world years ago.
[00:19:23.078 --> 00:19:24.939]  Said he'll be the one that brings in the dictatorship.
[00:19:25.219 --> 00:19:27.440]  He'll teach us how to behave, what to do.
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:33.943]  And he has now because they, they knew Canada was somewhat subservient and asleep, and they thought we'll make our move there.
[00:19:35.384 --> 00:19:39.266]  And it's come out now that Biden's people have been advising Trudeau on what to do.
[00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:44.709]  They declared anybody protesting lockdowns or election fraud terrorist in June of last year.
[00:19:44.769 --> 00:19:47.990]  That right there was spectacular.
[00:19:49.791 --> 00:19:50.752]  To put it on the news.
[00:19:52.307 --> 00:19:53.427]  Look out for terrorists.
[00:19:53.467 --> 00:19:55.828]  They don't want to have lockdowns or forced immoculations.
[00:19:58.049 --> 00:19:59.469]  Or they think there's election fraud.
[00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:02.851]  That's a terrorist.
[00:20:03.671 --> 00:20:05.552]  They declared you and I terrorists.
[00:20:07.192 --> 00:20:15.535]  Because they intend, by increment, to start arresting people and not giving them bail until trial, like hundreds of people that walk peacefully into the U.S.
[00:20:15.555 --> 00:20:15.935]  Capitol.
[00:20:16.275 --> 00:20:19.576]  And once that precedent's set, they're going to duplicate it across the world.
[00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:21.677]  This is world corporate government.
[00:20:23.171 --> 00:20:29.238]  So we're going to play this with audio and more when we come back in the next segment, the arrest of these poor individuals.
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:35.246]  But Freedom Convoy protest organizer Tamara Lich denied bail.
[00:20:36.192 --> 00:20:46.035]  On Tuesday, an Ontario court judge, you mean a tyrant, issued the decision in Ottawa saying she believed there was a substantial chance Lich would re-offend if released.
[00:20:46.135 --> 00:20:49.336]  Oh my gosh, I mean they let leftists out if they burn buildings and shoot people.
[00:20:49.956 --> 00:20:55.598]  Or rape kids, but that, no, no, no, that's all the George Soros judges and DAs, because he's gotten them put in there as well.
[00:20:56.318 --> 00:21:01.260]  No, no, no, she gets, they're saying it's a year until trial probably, and she faces 10 years in prison.
[00:21:03.381 --> 00:21:04.561]  Under the civil emergency.
[00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:13.200]  Ottawa Freedom Convoy protest organiser Tamara Litch has been denied bail after spending almost a week in jail.
[00:21:13.961 --> 00:21:19.830]  Litch, who was charged last Thursday with counselling to commit mischief.
[00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:20.491]  Mischief!
[00:21:22.125 --> 00:21:25.729]  In connection with Ottawa protest was denied bail Tuesday morning.
[00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:30.934]  She is one of the leading organizers behind the protest against COVID-19 restrictions.
[00:21:30.954 --> 00:21:35.859]  You mean the Great Reset, teach us all we're prisoners, lock us in our houses, forcibly inject us with poison?
[00:21:38.702 --> 00:21:43.167]  And it goes on deeper in the article that she promised to go home and not demonstrate anymore.
[00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:50.233]  But the judge wanted her to say that protesting was bad, period, and that she was bad and she wouldn't say it.
[00:21:50.534 --> 00:21:55.898]  So she said, okay, you're going into solitary confinement and you know they're going to push the trial and push the trial.
[00:21:55.918 --> 00:22:00.861]  It's already over a year with hundreds of people, January 6th, many of them didn't even go in the Capitol.
[00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:06.885]  There are people on record who didn't even go in the Capitol, who were just outside, who had been held in solitary confinement.
[00:22:08.767 --> 00:22:09.928]  What is it, four or five months now?
[00:22:10.408 --> 00:22:11.589]  The guy that grabbed the Green Beret.
[00:22:15.794 --> 00:22:21.837]  And they got a CNN special coming out Sunday night calling for my arrest and putting a bunch of fake news out.
[00:22:24.438 --> 00:22:31.021]  Having denied bail, Lynch is expected to be held until trial and she's not allowed with her lawyers to talk to any of the other organizers.
[00:22:31.301 --> 00:22:35.263]  Another serious authoritarian move like she's a racketeering mafia don.
[00:22:36.403 --> 00:22:41.285]  And of course they've seized all her private bank account so she can't have money for a lawyer to defend herself.
[00:22:42.246 --> 00:22:43.406]  To the gulag with you!
[00:22:43.966 --> 00:22:44.987]  To the dungeon with you!
[00:22:46.263 --> 00:23:06.598]  We'll show you a video of her and others being grabbed, being taken away by the police officers to now be thrown into a modern dungeon as political prisoners, not in Venezuela, not in Cuba, not in North Korea, not in communist China, but in North America.
[00:23:07.499 --> 00:23:10.501]  In liberal, happy Canada.
[00:23:11.382 --> 00:23:11.842]  Peaceful.
[00:23:12.529 --> 00:23:14.570]  No assaults, nothing, no violence.
[00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:15.531]  Crime went way down.
[00:23:15.891 --> 00:23:18.213]  Protesting, having their own chop encampment.
[00:23:19.614 --> 00:23:27.139]  And now because they organized it, they're not hailed, they're not praised, they go straight to the bottom of the jail.
[00:23:28.399 --> 00:23:34.423]  And it's Tamara Litsch today, it's you and I tomorrow.
[00:23:35.364 --> 00:23:36.705]  They're coming for everybody.
[00:23:37.105 --> 00:23:38.486]  Tyranny's making its move.
[00:23:40.054 --> 00:23:41.075]  All right, here's what I'm going to do.
[00:23:41.175 --> 00:23:44.738]  I'm going to give the number out starting next segment.
[00:23:44.758 --> 00:24:02.033]  We're going to write to your calls in the second hour, but I'm going to ask for only Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, German, French, and people from Austria.
[00:24:03.979 --> 00:24:32.351]  Because those are the places that the real martial law is in place, and where they're trying to push the forced injections to buy or sell or have a job, and where they're using LRAD sound and microwave cannons that have been used against the CIA, and when it's used against them, oh, they're poor victims, and it caused brain damage, and people have to retire, and it is bad that I think the Cubans and Russians and Chinese have been zapping U.S.
[00:24:32.411 --> 00:24:33.052]  embassies with these.
[00:24:33.931 --> 00:24:36.312]  But you don't think the West is doing it too?
[00:24:36.372 --> 00:24:44.415]  I mean, they do it to our people in Canada, in Australia, in New Zealand.
[00:24:44.475 --> 00:24:47.537]  They go out and they fry them with huge arrays of LRADs.
[00:24:48.577 --> 00:24:50.658]  Dozens of vehicles parked, just frying everybody.
[00:24:50.678 --> 00:24:53.859]  And of course, they're shooting them at people in Canada as well.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:16.103]   I remember when the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 15 years ago or so, The military was wanting to use microwave guns in Iraq, and the UN said, well, you got to use them on your people first, and under international law, then it can be called a police weapon, and then you can use it in war.
[00:25:18.784 --> 00:25:20.165]  That, oh, Havana Syndrome!
[00:25:20.465 --> 00:25:26.007]  High-level national security officials stricken with unexplained illness on White House grounds.
[00:25:27.042 --> 00:25:35.730]  And now it's happening to folks all over the place, and a lot of the times they're sick from the super high-powered 5 and 6G arrays they've got at the White House.
[00:25:37.772 --> 00:25:41.936]  Or those Air Force One, it's a flying antenna.
[00:25:43.077 --> 00:25:45.379]  It'll have the same effects as a giant microwave transmitter.
[00:25:47.181 --> 00:25:51.765]  But yes, a lot of these governments do have microwave weapons, and that's been going on since the 60s.
[00:25:53.888 --> 00:25:56.489]  But imagine this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:56.869 --> 00:26:15.618]  So when I open the phones up, it'll be for people specifically from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, France, Germany, and the worst is, well, the worst was Austria.
[00:26:16.618 --> 00:26:18.839]  Great people, great culture, but that's where Hitler came from.
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.840]  They follow orders pretty bad over there.
[00:26:21.341 --> 00:26:22.181]  And that's when you get a Hitler.
[00:26:23.487 --> 00:26:25.209]  And now they've been taught by Canada and Trudeau.
[00:26:25.529 --> 00:26:28.332]  And there's a big streak with the French with authoritarianism.
[00:26:29.272 --> 00:26:30.353]  Napoleon was a dictator.
[00:26:31.214 --> 00:26:37.340]  And France never got back to its freedom it had for a little while, which was still not much freedom at all.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.322]  They've been under Napoleonic law ever since.
[00:26:39.782 --> 00:26:43.005]  There's always been a big streak of tyranny in the east of Canada.
[00:26:44.026 --> 00:26:46.708]  Not knocking the great French people up there, but I mean, you know it.
[00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.649]  We all know it.
[00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:48.991]  Napoleonic law.
[00:26:50.009 --> 00:26:55.332]  And so that's what we're seeing exercised here, but at the directive of Klaus Schwab and the globalists.
[00:26:55.372 --> 00:26:57.072]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:26:57.413 --> 00:27:01.595]  So let's roll the footage of Tamara Lich being arrested last week.
[00:27:02.035 --> 00:27:05.116]  And she gets to be in solitary confinement for a year, year and a half, two years.
[00:27:05.636 --> 00:27:06.877]  They may never let her have a trial.
[00:27:06.897 --> 00:27:10.239]  Then she faces 10 years in prison.
[00:27:11.199 --> 00:27:14.541]  And the court said that she's not allowed to talk to her other evil co-conspirators.
[00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:15.921]  They're being told they're terrorists.
[00:27:17.862 --> 00:27:31.768]   She can't talk to The judge, Borogos, ordered Lich to have no contact with Pat King, Benjamin Ditcher, Christopher Barber, and Daniel Bulford, the other organizers.
[00:27:32.147 --> 00:27:36.707]   And here is her getting arrested along with Christopher Barber and being disappeared.
[00:27:36.707 --> 00:27:46.707]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:27:46.707 --> 00:27:49.747]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:50.030]  That's it.
[00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:57.051]  She's arresting her and she disappears into a labyrinth.
[00:27:57.071 --> 00:27:58.892]  The peaceful protesting.
[00:27:58.912 --> 00:28:03.213]  She threw a Molotov cocktail at the police station.
[00:28:03.032 --> 00:28:12.082]   peaceful protesting Through a mile off cocktail to police station she probation
[00:28:12.082 --> 00:28:21.291]   maybe but not protesting peacefully And they're letting her know, hey lady, this isn't like the old days where you'd get arrested.
[00:28:21.311 --> 00:28:24.953]  She's been in trouble before for civil rights stuff for indigenous groups.
[00:28:25.873 --> 00:28:26.774]  And you know, she's a real liberal.
[00:28:26.814 --> 00:28:27.974]  She believes in freedom of protest.
[00:28:27.994 --> 00:28:30.176]  Well, sorry lady, you're going to prison.
[00:28:35.138 --> 00:28:41.762]  She was totally confident in a statement that got out of the field for her lawyer, but now she finds out, oh no, you're not in Canada anymore.
[00:28:42.522 --> 00:28:43.443]  You're in the New World Order.
[00:28:47.122 --> 00:28:57.908]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Feds charged Owen Schroer with entering the Capitol, not just the Capitol grounds, and helping attack the Capitol, and getting people to attack.
[00:28:58.108 --> 00:29:07.994]  When he went with me, worked with us, tried to stop what happened, and they said in the federal filing, he has perjured himself, Owen Schroer does not work here.
[00:29:09.733 --> 00:29:11.414]  And we've gone to the federal court and said, here he is.
[00:29:11.454 --> 00:29:12.474]  He's worked there six years.
[00:29:12.874 --> 00:29:13.894]  Here's video of him working there.
[00:29:13.934 --> 00:29:14.755]  Here's his pay stub.
[00:29:15.035 --> 00:29:16.355]  And the judge is like, I don't want to see it.
[00:29:16.375 --> 00:29:16.715]  Doesn't matter.
[00:29:16.735 --> 00:29:17.415]  They're allowed to lie.
[00:29:18.536 --> 00:29:19.276]  Because they're the feds.
[00:29:21.236 --> 00:29:25.236]  And there's a barber being arrested and led away.
[00:29:25.236 --> 00:29:33.236]  Well, that's what you get for peacefully protesting.
[00:29:33.236 --> 00:29:43.236]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:29:34.701 --> 00:29:39.242]  Of course, that's the type of stuff happened before 1776 for about a decade for folks who said, you know what?
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:42.900]  It's 1776.
[00:29:44.781 --> 00:29:47.182]  But I'm not ready for 1776 physically.
[00:29:48.062 --> 00:30:03.226]  We're winning politically in the hearts and minds, but I will tell you, if these people don't get released from jail, and if higher courts don't strike this down, we do need to have the legislation now being introduced by a New Mexico Republican to give amnesty here.
[00:30:03.467 --> 00:30:05.607]  Folks used to dodge the draft and run up to Canada.
[00:30:06.347 --> 00:30:08.008]  Well, this is dodging going to prison.
[00:30:10.146 --> 00:30:13.808]  I mean, I think if she got out on bail, she probably needs to run to the United States.
[00:30:13.828 --> 00:30:15.829]  But the question is, how long will the U.S.
[00:30:15.869 --> 00:30:16.269]  be free?
[00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:27.055]  I mean, if you're in a country where they hold you indefinitely for peaceful protest, well then, what are you supposed to do?
[00:30:28.016 --> 00:30:29.617]  No, you shouldn't do that.
[00:30:29.657 --> 00:30:37.801]  She should stay in jail, as an example, and be Christ-like, and show the world the tyranny we're facing, and it will end up backlashing on these people, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:40.217 --> 00:30:44.259]  But it is absolutely amazing, ladies and gentlemen, that this is going on.
[00:30:45.739 --> 00:30:51.121]  GOP lawmaker introduced bill to grant asylum to Canadian truckers persecuted by Canada's Trudeau regime.
[00:30:51.401 --> 00:30:52.942]  That is very serious.
[00:30:53.462 --> 00:30:57.704]  Yeah, how about Trudeau just say, we'll release you, but you must leave.
[00:30:57.724 --> 00:31:00.345]  Because usually that's what dictators do.
[00:31:00.365 --> 00:31:01.425]  They'll expel people.
[00:31:01.625 --> 00:31:02.826]  Hey, you got a year to get out.
[00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:05.111]  We're going to force injections on everybody.
[00:31:05.131 --> 00:31:06.472]  We're going to take your children.
[00:31:06.833 --> 00:31:07.633]  We run your lives.
[00:31:07.653 --> 00:31:09.255]  We're going to lock you down on a routine basis.
[00:31:09.555 --> 00:31:10.676]  You got one year to leave.
[00:31:10.776 --> 00:31:12.737]  But in the last two years, what did he say?
[00:31:13.158 --> 00:31:15.059]  Canadians are not allowed to leave.
[00:31:17.301 --> 00:31:19.103]  But the refugees are flying in en masse.
[00:31:19.683 --> 00:31:22.725]  Trudeau takes a knee against police brutality while cities are burning.
[00:31:25.448 --> 00:31:29.871]  But when you try to go out and protest tyranny, you go straight to jail when you're peaceful.
[00:31:31.352 --> 00:31:31.953]  And it gets worse.
[00:31:35.043 --> 00:31:38.985]  Rand Paul warns that Trudeau's Tyrannical Emergencies Act can be implemented in the U.S.
[00:31:39.625 --> 00:31:39.845]  Yeah.
[00:31:41.146 --> 00:31:42.887]  Executive exclusive poll.
[00:31:43.968 --> 00:31:47.609]  Majority of Democrats back Trudeau's crackdown, freezing bank accounts of truckers.
[00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:50.611]  They're now celebrating no bail on Twitter.
[00:31:51.604 --> 00:31:56.507]  Democrats overwhelmingly approved Trudeau's crackdown on freedom, on protesters, and on the press.
[00:31:57.148 --> 00:31:59.809]  They're saying only certified government-funded members of the press.
[00:31:59.829 --> 00:32:01.911]  They fund over 700 groups now.
[00:32:02.291 --> 00:32:05.153]  Just since Trudeau got in, he gives $600 million a year to them.
[00:32:05.413 --> 00:32:09.635]  So only approved media that's state-sponsored now is even allowed at the Parliament.
[00:32:09.675 --> 00:32:10.376]  That's another story.
[00:32:12.337 --> 00:32:12.617]  Wow.
[00:32:14.759 --> 00:32:19.802]  Jan 6 video shows Oath Keepers working with Capitol Police to rescue riot police.
[00:32:20.802 --> 00:32:22.363]  They were rewarded with being indicted.
[00:32:22.603 --> 00:32:23.843]  This is totally exculpatory.
[00:32:23.863 --> 00:32:24.643]  They should all be released.
[00:32:25.684 --> 00:32:26.604]  They weren't feds, folks.
[00:32:27.444 --> 00:32:28.845]  There were some feds there providing tutoring.
[00:32:30.706 --> 00:32:36.728]  Today, a member of Parliament details how a struggling single mother's bank account has been frozen by Trudeau's regime.
[00:32:37.128 --> 00:32:39.029]  No way to learn how to get off of it, either.
[00:32:40.929 --> 00:32:44.771]  Even Globalist magazine, The Economist, warns Trudeau to stop policing thoughts.
[00:32:47.913 --> 00:32:52.677]  Even the National Post in Canada says the Emergencies Act is far more dangerous than you think.
[00:32:55.159 --> 00:32:56.080]  But it gets worse.
[00:32:57.121 --> 00:33:06.748]  The left is now saying, ban the word honk, that it is for the letter H, which means Heil Hitler, and their next move is to ban the word, the letter H. I'm not joking.
[00:33:07.329 --> 00:33:09.410]  The letter H. They control everything.
[00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.911]  They are God.
[00:33:10.672 --> 00:33:15.536]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us for the final segment of this first hour.
[00:33:15.556 --> 00:33:29.966]  I'm going to give the number out here in a few minutes and we're going to go directly to your calls next hour from Canada, from Germany, from Austria, from New Zealand, from France, from Australia where the real tyranny is in place.
[00:33:31.407 --> 00:33:34.889]  What do you make of the incredible draconian actions?
[00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:40.692]   And things are so bad I have trouble Getting it all in.
[00:33:42.884 --> 00:33:43.468]  And the angles.
[00:33:45.475 --> 00:33:54.297]  Graduates of the Davos Group Bilderberg World Government Tyranny School of Klaus Schwab are half of the premiers, the governors of Canada.
[00:33:55.217 --> 00:34:08.080]  And so I started poking around last night and I said, I wonder who the Ottawa mayor is that announced they're going to confiscate the property, not just the bank accounts, but the 18 wheelers, cars, vans, without trial, without anything, and just sell them.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.900]  Forfeiture under martial law.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.161]  I wonder if he's a Davos Group graduate.
[00:34:13.381 --> 00:34:14.001]  And he is.
[00:34:15.888 --> 00:34:16.568]  I got that right here.
[00:34:18.769 --> 00:34:23.251]  I mean, like I said, you can't make this stuff up.
[00:34:25.112 --> 00:34:26.553]  This is a corporate dictatorship.
[00:34:26.693 --> 00:34:28.493]  They want a cashless society.
[00:34:28.693 --> 00:34:31.955]  They want a vaccine pass that is the social credit score.
[00:34:32.135 --> 00:34:34.436]  And they've said that and they're implementing it right now.
[00:34:35.967 --> 00:34:52.379]  And that's why they want a civil war here in America, to then turn the lights out for a few months, when everybody capitulates and begs, you get your new ID, and then selectively, your power's turned back on at your house, when you submit, when you sign on, when you take the shots, when you do what they say.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.521]  Yeah, Mayor Jim Watson.
[00:34:56.342 --> 00:34:58.664]  I mean, just look at these people, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:58.844 --> 00:35:01.006]  People make fun of rappers wearing gold chains around their necks.
[00:35:01.326 --> 00:35:03.708]  I mean, they see what the elites do, they're like, hell, I'm doing the same thing!
[00:35:05.433 --> 00:35:08.096]  Will people listen to me more if I wore a big giant gold chain around my neck?
[00:35:08.136 --> 00:35:08.976]  Maybe I should start doing it.
[00:35:09.537 --> 00:35:11.158]  Got a whole big damn grill going here.
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:16.123]  Guard your grills, what I can say, because I'm getting tired of this crap.
[00:35:17.224 --> 00:35:20.367]  Ottawa Mayor proposes to sell confiscated Freedom Convoy trucks.
[00:35:20.927 --> 00:35:22.509]  But wait, it gets even more insane.
[00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:30.096]  Canadian Member of Parliament, Yara Sachs, says that Honk Honk is an acronym for Heil Hitler.
[00:35:32.291 --> 00:35:33.811]  No, it's for Clown World, honk honk.
[00:35:34.312 --> 00:35:37.872]  She is literally saying that if you blow your car horn, it makes you a Nazi.
[00:35:38.052 --> 00:35:44.214]  Well, the ADL said, ban the OK sign, and they're looking at taking out of their national sign language.
[00:35:44.874 --> 00:35:49.355]  They're saying SWAT teams shouldn't use it, and divers shouldn't use it, and construction workers.
[00:35:49.955 --> 00:35:55.177]  Like, OK, yeah, you know, you're placing a beam or something, you tell the boom operator, yeah, you got it.
[00:35:58.519 --> 00:36:01.541]  Bring your hands together as you get closer, and then, all right, you got it!
[00:36:01.841 --> 00:36:03.022]  No, it's Hitler!
[00:36:03.463 --> 00:36:04.643]  The ADL is God!
[00:36:04.743 --> 00:36:05.964]  They said you can't do that!
[00:36:07.145 --> 00:36:16.772]  And now, this creature says, honking, ladies and gentlemen, is Heil Hitler.
[00:36:16.972 --> 00:36:17.432]  What's next?
[00:36:17.512 --> 00:36:18.433]  Ban the letter H?
[00:36:19.494 --> 00:36:23.317]  Don't want to give the Southern Poverty Law Center or ADL ideas, but it's about they control the language.
[00:36:23.637 --> 00:36:24.517]  They control it all.
[00:36:24.718 --> 00:36:25.178]  Here she is.
[00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:39.176]  How much vitriol do we have to see of Honk Honk, which is an acronym for Hail Hitler, do we need to see by these protesters on social media?
[00:36:41.196 --> 00:36:41.896]  How much?
[00:36:42.757 --> 00:36:43.377]  How many?
[00:36:43.397 --> 00:36:47.738]  By the way, in case you missed it, let's play it again.
[00:36:52.031 --> 00:37:02.678]  How much vitriol do we have to see of Hong Kong, which is an acronym for Hail Hitler, do we need to see by these protesters on social media?
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:05.400]  How much?
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.381]  How much?
[00:37:06.441 --> 00:37:07.542]  We have to see it!
[00:37:08.602 --> 00:37:16.127]  And I guess if you asked her, hey, they're going to hold the protest leaders without bail and take everything they've got and just keep them in prison.
[00:37:16.248 --> 00:37:17.588]  And I bet she'd like clicker.
[00:37:17.609 --> 00:37:19.049]  He'll say that's how we fight Hitler.
[00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:20.971]  We disappear people in the camps.
[00:37:25.436 --> 00:37:32.924]  Yeah, here is the Ottawa mayor speaking at the World Economic Forum five years ago, and now we learn he's a young global leader with them.
[00:37:35.567 --> 00:37:42.114]  And see, Trudeau knows, just like Tony Blair or any of these criminals that launch wars, commit all these crimes, he'll be rehabilitated later.
[00:37:42.154 --> 00:37:45.017]  He'll get the blame, he'll be hated, he'll be unpopular, but he doesn't give a damn.
[00:37:46.698 --> 00:37:48.020]  Because he thinks you don't have a memory.
[00:37:50.188 --> 00:37:51.629]  We're going to teach our children to wake up.
[00:37:51.649 --> 00:37:58.255]  We're going to teach our children to know the truth and understand that they're not going to be like the past generation, and they're going to value it.
[00:37:58.855 --> 00:37:59.876]  That's how the pendulum works.
[00:38:00.537 --> 00:38:02.218]  They think they can stop the pendulum of history?
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.220]  They can't.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:10.085]  These are dishonorable people that were part of this, and they know they were, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:12.032 --> 00:38:21.237]  And thank God the truckers weren't violent and took the abuse and took the attacks and had their ribs broken and got run over with horses because we're winning right now because people didn't fight back.
[00:38:21.657 --> 00:38:24.039]  Yeah, all these people online will say, Jones, you're a wimp.
[00:38:24.279 --> 00:38:25.299]  You should be calling for violence.
[00:38:25.359 --> 00:38:29.482]  But they're not doing anything violent because they're feds or globalists or leftists.
[00:38:34.364 --> 00:38:40.648]  So it just goes on and on and on and on.
[00:38:42.358 --> 00:38:45.880]  And here's photos and videos all over Canada of millions marching.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.523]  They estimate a million marched in Toronto and in Calgary and other areas.
[00:38:52.164 --> 00:38:55.126]  So the intimidation's not working, and that's why they're scared.
[00:38:55.146 --> 00:38:57.767]  They're like, oh, if you organize it, we'll put you in prison.
[00:38:58.788 --> 00:39:00.029]  Well, you better build big prisons.
[00:39:00.149 --> 00:39:00.909]  Oh, you did.
[00:39:01.309 --> 00:39:02.810]  All those COVID camps.
[00:39:03.111 --> 00:39:07.073]  And now, like I told you two years ago, they'd segway from COVID to, oh, political camps.
[00:39:07.653 --> 00:39:08.574]  Those were the training wheels.
[00:39:11.002 --> 00:39:23.777]  Now I know I haven't hit Russia, and it was easy to predict that if Putin did anything, he would take those Russian-held areas that were part of Russia, that he's really pissed off that Lenin signed over to Ukraine.
[00:39:24.672 --> 00:39:27.672]   And that Stalin later signed over more with his deal with Hitler.
[00:39:27.672 --> 00:39:29.471]  You know, Stalin worked with Hitler at first.
[00:39:29.471 --> 00:39:30.771]  And it was so incredible.
[00:39:30.771 --> 00:39:35.672]   And I'm going to do an emergency broadcast, either tomorrow night or the next night,
[00:39:35.672 --> 00:39:37.572]  where we take calls for three hours.
[00:39:37.572 --> 00:39:41.371]   And I'm going to—but one hour is going to be playing his speech and analyzing it.
[00:39:41.371 --> 00:39:45.072]   My mouth—because we didn't have time to play the whole thing yesterday live on air,
[00:39:45.072 --> 00:39:46.572]  so I get to see it all.
[00:39:46.926 --> 00:39:47.906]  I watched it last night.
[00:39:47.987 --> 00:39:51.208]  My mouth was hanging open.
[00:39:51.768 --> 00:39:53.049]  Communism's bad.
[00:39:53.429 --> 00:39:54.590]  Stalin was bad.
[00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:55.970]  Lenin was bad.
[00:39:56.331 --> 00:39:57.831]  You want to decommunize things?
[00:39:57.931 --> 00:39:58.512]  We're doing it.
[00:39:59.512 --> 00:40:00.473]  We're having kids.
[00:40:00.793 --> 00:40:01.913]  We're a free market.
[00:40:01.972 --> 00:40:05.172]   then we're going to fight back against the globalists and the monopolies
[00:40:05.172 --> 00:40:09.572]  and the West corporations trying to make everybody puppets.
[00:40:09.572 --> 00:40:18.773]   It's so weird to tune into a world leader and just truth coming out.
[00:40:19.437 --> 00:40:20.197]  It was all true.
[00:40:20.437 --> 00:40:24.057]  He said, I'm sorry the Russians came into Ukraine when we were born.
[00:40:24.097 --> 00:40:25.638]  You're more Russian than most Russians.
[00:40:26.978 --> 00:40:29.258]  We're sorry that the communists killed you and abused you.
[00:40:29.278 --> 00:40:30.119]  We apologize.
[00:40:30.179 --> 00:40:31.059]  Communists are bad.
[00:40:31.739 --> 00:40:34.719]  And we want you to be free and we're not going to take you over.
[00:40:35.159 --> 00:40:36.720]  Just your government needs to go.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.740]  It was put in power by the West.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:43.921]  You have your own government and you need to stop attacking Eastern Ukraine.
[00:40:48.368 --> 00:40:51.950]  That's what I would do, knowing world history, if I was the leader of Russia.
[00:40:53.271 --> 00:40:56.552]  I mean, it's like, hard to find fault with this man.
[00:40:59.033 --> 00:41:00.594]  But of course, what did I tell you was going to come next?
[00:41:00.754 --> 00:41:02.655]  Oh, the Russians are going to attack our satellites.
[00:41:02.935 --> 00:41:04.576]  The Russians are going to attack our pipelines.
[00:41:04.836 --> 00:41:06.197]  The Russians are going to turn our lights out.
[00:41:06.477 --> 00:41:08.498]  Well, Klaus Schwab brags he's getting ready to do it!
[00:41:09.759 --> 00:41:11.480]  What, the Russians turning off pipelines?
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.921]  The Germans just turned their pipeline off to Russia.
[00:41:15.049 --> 00:41:16.310]  The Russian pipeline coming in.
[00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:19.251]  It's the globalists turning our power plants off.
[00:41:19.451 --> 00:41:23.112]  It's the globalists shutting our infrastructure down.
[00:41:23.172 --> 00:41:25.573]  The same freaking people that think we're their slaves.
[00:41:25.953 --> 00:41:29.575]  And thank God the Russians have wriggled free of that freaking python.
[00:41:29.595 --> 00:41:30.235]  I hope we can.
[00:41:31.095 --> 00:41:34.539]  By the way, I need funding or we're not going to be here, but that's not the real reason you need this.
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:35.841]  This is increaser.
[00:41:35.861 --> 00:41:37.002]  Do you see these products right here?

[00:41:56.891 --> 00:42:02.896]  It's not just about your stamina and libido and energy and all electrochemical activity in the body and cells must have iodine.
[00:42:03.656 --> 00:42:04.557]  The opposite is fluoride.
[00:42:04.737 --> 00:42:05.558]  That's where they hit you with that.
[00:42:06.779 --> 00:42:08.560]  It also is for your immune system.

[00:43:57.423 --> 00:43:58.501]  you need.

[00:44:20.822 --> 00:44:23.742]  (electronic music)
[00:44:24.016 --> 00:44:33.446]  The new tyranny is finally rearing its ugly head as the graduates of the World Economic Forum's Young Leaders are forcing tyranny onto the world stage.
[00:44:33.606 --> 00:44:37.930]  Actually, I really question the motivation of what I see down there.
[00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:40.553]  So how do you fix it, Prime Minister?
[00:44:40.593 --> 00:44:41.354]  How do you fix it?
[00:44:42.034 --> 00:44:45.817]  Oh, how do you fix the issue of misinformation and disinformation?
[00:44:45.897 --> 00:44:48.238]  No, I mean how do you fix that?
[00:44:48.278 --> 00:44:49.319]  How do you fix the anger?
[00:44:49.379 --> 00:44:53.322]  How do you fix those messages of violence against people?
[00:44:54.162 --> 00:44:57.725]  And that's actually, it does come back to misinformation.
[00:44:57.745 --> 00:45:07.211]  For quite some time now I've obviously been confronted by protest and what has stood out to me is the fact that so many are there based on things that simply aren't true.
[00:45:11.071 --> 00:45:24.216]  And so this is an issue that the globe is grappling with and we do need to grapple with because seeing people so enraged by things that just aren't true is worrisome and it's something that we are all going to have to confront.
[00:45:25.097 --> 00:45:30.959]  But what we've seen out there, I have to say, seems much more anti-vaccination more than anything else.
[00:45:31.139 --> 00:45:37.782]  It's included yelling abuse at people who are walking around with masks on, occupying spaces where businesses are operating.
[00:45:38.382 --> 00:45:40.323]  Blocking people's ability to move around freely.
[00:45:40.363 --> 00:45:42.164]  That is moving beyond a protest.
[00:45:42.224 --> 00:45:50.530]  In fact, to me, it looks like an imported style of protest that I have not seen in New Zealand before, complete with Trump flags and Canadian flags.
[00:45:51.070 --> 00:46:00.036]  When it comes to the management of the protest, so Melissa and the Speaker, or indeed the decisions by the police, you know, ultimately I need to let them do their jobs.
[00:46:00.076 --> 00:46:01.617]  Those are their jurisdictions.
[00:46:01.957 --> 00:46:05.460]  Have you seen any children in trouble tonight that you're concerned about?
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.042]  We've been out patrolling for about half an hour, 45 minutes.
[00:46:08.062 --> 00:46:09.243]  We haven't seen anything like that.
[00:46:09.283 --> 00:46:10.264]  Everything's been really good.
[00:46:10.464 --> 00:46:12.125]  Yeah, and people are behaving themselves.
[00:46:12.465 --> 00:46:14.467]  Yep, everything's looking really good from what we've seen.
[00:46:14.647 --> 00:46:15.948]  Yeah, caring for each other.
[00:46:16.589 --> 00:46:18.870]  The vibe is very nice.
[00:46:18.931 --> 00:46:21.553]  And has anyone said anything to you that you're concerned about?
[00:46:22.253 --> 00:46:22.433]  No.
[00:46:22.814 --> 00:46:32.223]  These protests are a mix of New Zealand, they're regular garden variety Kiwis and they're just sticking up for their rights and I think they're being treated really badly.
[00:46:32.243 --> 00:46:38.529]  There's also a group there who are representing people who have lost their jobs, who are just angry at the vaccine mandates.
[00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:47.233]  And they actually represent people who are not there on Parliament grounds, but who feel like that within our society because they may have lost their jobs.
[00:46:47.253 --> 00:46:51.074]  Do you feel the appropriate way to deal with those people is to spray water on them?
[00:46:55.736 --> 00:47:01.876]   way of managing a protest in its totality because those ultimately very clear distinctions
[00:47:01.876 --> 00:47:04.575]   I'm going to be careful to make sure that I'm not making judgments around
[00:47:04.575 --> 00:47:09.536]   the way we deal with protest at Parliament because it's a dangerous place to be in politicians
[00:47:09.536 --> 00:47:13.775]   dictating particularly the way that the police might choose to deal with them.
[00:47:13.775 --> 00:47:29.285]   But may I first just say, if this were Melissa Ritchie If this were a protest that was solely around the policies that have been used to manage a pandemic, then why is it that every journalist who stands out on that forecourt is being hurled abuse about telling the truth?
[00:47:29.365 --> 00:47:32.087]  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.
[00:47:32.347 --> 00:47:44.219]  One of Klaus Schwab's disciples of the Great Reset appears to be reading from the same script shared by her partners in tyranny, claiming protest is a hallmark of democracy.
[00:47:44.419 --> 00:47:52.507]  But these protesters, peacefully demanding the immediate return of their freedoms, are violent, racist, insurrectionists.
[00:47:52.995 --> 00:47:58.481]  Our focus is on the well-being of all New Zealanders, including the vast majority who are not on those grounds.
[00:47:58.521 --> 00:48:06.110]  With the history of negotiations in terms of your ministers at Ihumātao, would your government ever be open to negotiating with those people?
[00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:08.653]  I do not consider this to be the same.
[00:48:10.704 --> 00:48:21.829]  Through the WEF, initiated by Klaus Schwab in 1971, Mr. Global has been training his own puppets since 1992 through the Young Global Leaders Program.
[00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:23.110]  You may have heard of this.
[00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:28.152]  Angela Merkel and Bill Gates were among the first class to graduate the class of 1992.
[00:48:29.953 --> 00:48:56.116]  Even a large number of current leaders, predominantly very weak personalities with, however, mostly well-trained rhetorical skills, also come from this program, including Macron in France, Kurz in Austria, Justin Trudeau in Canada, Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand, but also the German Health Minister, Jens Spahn, and the EU Commission Head, Ursula von der Leyen.
[00:48:57.156 --> 00:49:09.403]  She, by the way, as we have just learned from a whistleblower who is a translator with the European Union, is supposed to become the first little global government's head, the EU.
[00:49:09.563 --> 00:49:11.024]  They're trying to take over.
[00:49:11.344 --> 00:49:12.625]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:49:12.645 --> 00:49:16.167]  Alright folks, get ready, we're going to break them up.
[00:49:16.207 --> 00:49:17.587]  Phones up, stay with us.
[00:49:18.568 --> 00:49:37.211]   Alright, some stations join us in the second, third and fourth hour today, but the first hour I hit the Bone-chilling news that even I found hard to believe at this juncture, but the Dabos Group, through their puppet politicians and the Great Reset, are just accelerating tyranny ahead of the financial collapse.
[00:49:37.711 --> 00:49:40.973]  So they're in a race to normalize all of these tyrannical actions.
[00:49:42.334 --> 00:49:47.936]  Freedom Convoy protest organizers, not just Tamara Lynch, denied bail.
[00:49:49.197 --> 00:49:50.438]  Peaceful protesters.
[00:49:51.378 --> 00:49:57.905]   She could be in jail up to a year, faces 10 years in prison for peacefully Protesting, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:58.366 --> 00:50:09.553]  And now we have Democrat members of Congress like Ruben Gallego calling for Americans that protest that are conservative to be held without bail and their cars and trucks to be taken.
[00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:12.891]  That's exactly what Rand Paul has been warning about.
[00:50:12.911 --> 00:50:15.512]  You can see the interview with Rand Paul on Infowars.com.
[00:50:15.873 --> 00:50:20.055]  Senator Paul warns that Trudeau's Tyrannical Emergencies Act can be implemented in the U.S.
[00:50:20.335 --> 00:50:25.617]  Well, yeah, it's actually the White House is advising Trudeau on declaring protesters terrorists.
[00:50:25.657 --> 00:50:25.957]  Remember?
[00:50:26.298 --> 00:50:30.540]  That's what they put in law or under the regulations in June of last year here in the U.S.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:34.521]  Protesting open borders, protesting election fraud, protesting lockdowns.
[00:50:34.701 --> 00:50:35.522]  That's not allowed.
[00:50:36.448 --> 00:50:37.429]  Burn down police stations.
[00:50:37.929 --> 00:50:38.650]  Burn down shops.
[00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:39.230]  Kill people.
[00:50:39.391 --> 00:50:39.591]  Rape.
[00:50:39.731 --> 00:50:40.011]  Murder.
[00:50:40.271 --> 00:50:40.872]  Molest children.
[00:50:40.972 --> 00:50:41.533]  Absolutely.
[00:50:43.354 --> 00:50:44.635]  And they have a big national pullout.
[00:50:44.655 --> 00:50:48.659]  Majority of Democrats back Trudeau's crackdown on freezing bank accounts of truckers.
[00:50:48.699 --> 00:50:51.501]  Now Democrats are celebrating on Twitter and Instagram.
[00:50:51.521 --> 00:50:52.462]  We're writing an article about it.
[00:50:53.403 --> 00:50:56.125]  Just about a thousand saying, wonderful arrest all conservatives.
[00:50:56.486 --> 00:50:57.687]  Put them in jail.
[00:50:58.684 --> 00:50:59.865]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:50:59.945 --> 00:51:12.711]  And now we have a clip of Trudeau mimicking what his finance minister said two days ago, that we want a permanent digital emergency, all transactions tracked in live time, and we will decide what you can buy and what you can sell.
[00:51:12.731 --> 00:51:19.895]  And I have an article out of the Times of London calling for the same thing.
[00:51:21.816 --> 00:51:26.538]  But that is coming up after we take some action.
[00:51:27.378 --> 00:51:29.018]  of your phone calls.
[00:51:29.018 --> 00:51:32.097]  I had it in my stack and I can't find it now.
[00:51:32.097 --> 00:51:34.057]  There's just too much stuff in here.
[00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:38.577]   Will you guys reprint me the, there were several articles but it was,
[00:51:38.577 --> 00:51:49.858]   Bank of England orders their researchers to find out how to program the new digital money.
[00:51:49.858 --> 00:51:51.018]  That's the headline.
[00:51:51.018 --> 00:51:55.498]   And then you read it, it's their Federal Reserve head going, we're gonna control the currency
[00:51:55.498 --> 00:52:00.617]   and mark the currency on what you can buy and what you can use it for and it will track you.
[00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:11.538]   I mean, just unbelievable stuff that we knew was coming, being done on a mass, mass scale.
[00:52:11.538 --> 00:52:16.617]   But I'll dig through my stacks during the next break and I'll be able, oh, here it is, I found it.
[00:52:16.617 --> 00:52:18.457]  I found it right here.
[00:52:18.457 --> 00:52:19.338]  And then I'm gonna give the number out.
[00:52:19.338 --> 00:52:20.978]  Let me give the number out first.
[00:52:20.978 --> 00:52:25.317]  I wanna hear from folks in Australia.
[00:52:25.317 --> 00:52:27.137]  I wanna hear from folks in New Zealand.
[00:52:27.137 --> 00:52:34.698]   I wanna hear from folks in Spain or France or Germany or Austria or the new mega police state of
[00:52:34.698 --> 00:52:37.577]   Canada where they're arresting peaceful demonstrators,
[00:52:37.577 --> 00:52:41.177]   holding them without bail, facing 10 years in prison, seizing their bank accounts,
[00:52:41.177 --> 00:52:46.338]   saying they're gonna sell their vehicles, sell their belongings outside of law,
[00:52:46.338 --> 00:52:48.338]  under martial law, the parliament voting.
[00:52:49.292 --> 00:52:59.961]  Retroactively to give him martial law, dictatorial powers, just as the German Bundestag did in 1933.
[00:53:02.203 --> 00:53:03.424]  So what an incredible time.
[00:53:04.064 --> 00:53:11.730]  And please, listeners, that means it's only for callers that are in those countries or have been part of those protests or truckers that have witnessed it.
[00:53:11.811 --> 00:53:14.713]  What is your take on this situation?
[00:53:14.813 --> 00:53:18.236]  Then tomorrow, I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:53:19.468 --> 00:53:23.529]  For people in Eastern Europe, Ukrainians, Russians, Poles.
[00:53:24.189 --> 00:53:24.989]  Agree with Putin.
[00:53:25.029 --> 00:53:25.929]  Disagree with Putin.
[00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:27.570]  Agree with Ukraine.
[00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:28.510]  Agree with Biden.
[00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:29.230]  Disagree.
[00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:31.151]  We don't censor your calls.
[00:53:31.171 --> 00:53:34.231]  Just clean phone line and you got something to say and you're on air.
[00:53:34.551 --> 00:53:36.612]  We're not like the corporate media or other talk shows.
[00:53:36.632 --> 00:53:40.613]  You call and they screen your call for 10 minutes and make sure they agree with your opinion before they put you on.
[00:53:40.873 --> 00:53:42.013]  We want to have a real debate here.
[00:53:43.007 --> 00:53:46.752]  Freedom still lives at Infowars.com and on the syndicated broadcast.
[00:53:46.772 --> 00:53:47.133]  877-789-2539.
[00:53:47.153 --> 00:53:47.353]  877-789-Alex.
[00:53:47.373 --> 00:53:47.433]  877-789-2539.
[00:53:47.533 --> 00:53:48.835]  And obviously a lot of you outside the U.S.
[00:53:48.675 --> 00:53:55.675]  2539-877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[00:53:55.675 --> 00:54:00.274]   And obviously a lot of you outside the U.S. may not be able to call a 1-800 number.
[00:54:00.274 --> 00:54:01.274]  Well that's okay.
[00:54:01.671 --> 00:54:06.913]  You can call country code 01-512-646-1776.
[00:54:07.593 --> 00:54:13.975]  That's 01-512-646-1776.
[00:54:15.835 --> 00:54:19.756]  But here's what I was mentioning, then we'll go to break and come back with your phone calls.
[00:54:21.277 --> 00:54:28.119]  Canadian member of Parliament says single mom has her bank account frozen for donating $50 to Freedom Convoy.
[00:54:28.159 --> 00:54:28.859]  We have that clip.
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:31.000]  We'll cue it up and play it in a moment.
[00:54:31.721 --> 00:54:36.182]  But first, here is the big news headline.
[00:54:36.622 --> 00:54:41.003]  Bank of England tells ministers to intervene on digital currency programming.
[00:54:41.703 --> 00:54:45.725]  And folks are obviously saying, Alex Jones is right again on Twitter.
[00:54:46.205 --> 00:54:50.346]  Imagine if the same applied to government, if taxpayers had control over government spending.
[00:54:51.181 --> 00:54:53.463]  That's one reason they'll probably exempt themselves from that.
[00:54:53.923 --> 00:54:55.384]  This is the Global Social Credit Score.
[00:54:55.684 --> 00:54:56.665]  Here's a long telegraph.
[00:54:57.225 --> 00:55:01.528]  Bank of England tells ministers to intervene on digital currency programming.
[00:55:02.929 --> 00:55:19.780]  The Bank of England has called on ministers to decide whether a central bank digital currency, they're all about to roll these out when they plunge all the currencies, should be programmable, that's a quote, ultimately giving the issuer control over how it is spent by the recipient.
[00:55:20.509 --> 00:55:25.771]  The holy grail of control now going in in Canada.
[00:55:26.511 --> 00:55:30.033]  Total surveillance, total social credit score, carbon tax.
[00:55:31.353 --> 00:55:36.856]  They admit the introduction is the vaccine passport and QR codes at the restaurants.
[00:55:36.876 --> 00:55:37.916]  They're training you like you're a dog.
[00:55:37.956 --> 00:55:39.477]  It's all behavioral psychology.
[00:55:40.557 --> 00:55:41.398]  Operant conditioning.
[00:55:43.899 --> 00:55:44.439]  Pavlov.
[00:55:45.459 --> 00:55:47.240]  So here they are.
[00:55:48.672 --> 00:55:49.352]  And they're doing it.
[00:55:49.912 --> 00:55:51.973]  And they just announced that they're doing it to you.
[00:55:53.113 --> 00:56:07.895]  And once they get this in place, you think you're in Vice Scripps now, when Larry Fink, who invented housing derivatives, was allowed, because he's a made man in the global mafia, to roll those out in the 80s?
[00:56:08.075 --> 00:56:09.095]  Larry Fink of BlackRock?
[00:56:10.216 --> 00:56:15.237]  Larry Fink's going to bankrupt the whole world economy in a Ponzi scheme, and him and his buddies will be in control.
[00:56:15.497 --> 00:56:17.897]  He's on the board of directors of the Davos Group.
[00:56:20.834 --> 00:56:25.938]  And everything else you can imagine evil, just like the finance minister, and just like Trudeau.
[00:56:27.339 --> 00:56:30.802]  And they're making a run at the Canadians, like, whoo, we didn't think you'd protest.
[00:56:31.182 --> 00:56:31.782]  Well, guess what?
[00:56:31.843 --> 00:56:44.432]  When you did, we already had it planned to take all your rights and all your freedoms away and put you in jail for at least a decade for protesting peacefully.
[00:56:45.133 --> 00:56:50.256]   And CNN is Just creaming themselves right now.
[00:56:50.276 --> 00:56:51.416]  This is so wonderful.
[00:56:51.777 --> 00:56:55.179]  They've got a big show coming out, calling for my arrest and the rest of it.
[00:56:55.199 --> 00:56:56.100]  I'll tell you about that later.
[00:56:56.660 --> 00:57:01.104]  Because not that CNN has any viewers that it matters, except it's the mind of Satan.
[00:57:02.184 --> 00:57:08.029]  When you listen to the incoherent babblings of these people, you can get a good idea of where they're going and what they're doing.
[00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:14.914]  And they definitely got their little knives out for yours truly.
[00:57:15.274 --> 00:57:16.595]  And I expect this.
[00:57:16.695 --> 00:57:17.556]  I know the road I'm on.
[00:57:21.288 --> 00:57:22.928]  But the coward dies a thousand deaths.
[00:57:24.169 --> 00:57:26.329]  People of courage only taste of death but once.
[00:57:27.809 --> 00:57:32.410]  And where there are men of courage, there is honor and there is freedom and there is prosperity and there is a good world.
[00:57:33.611 --> 00:57:47.894]  And so, whatever happens to me happens, but I want you to maximize our message and maximize the articles and videos and don't take info wars or anybody's speech or your speech for granted ever and don't ever underestimate how important you are.
[00:57:49.747 --> 00:57:54.330]  And how the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:55.511]  They wouldn't be brainwashing.
[00:57:55.751 --> 00:57:57.532]  They wouldn't be censoring if they were strong.
[00:57:57.832 --> 00:57:58.372]  They're weak.
[00:57:58.592 --> 00:57:59.253]  They're frauds.
[00:57:59.293 --> 00:57:59.853]  They're criminals.
[00:58:00.173 --> 00:58:05.977]  And just like Bernie Madoff, and just like Adolf Hitler, they will all pay for what they've done.
[00:58:06.277 --> 00:58:06.877]  And they know it!
[00:58:08.979 --> 00:58:23.655]   Tom Mouton, the director of the Bank of England, said during a conference on Monday that programming could become a key feature of any future central bank digital currency, in which the money Would be programmed to be released only when something happened.
[00:58:24.236 --> 00:58:26.117]  And would be tied to how you behave.
[00:58:26.637 --> 00:58:27.998]  You could introduce programmability.
[00:58:28.839 --> 00:58:34.002]  What happens if one of the participants in a transaction puts a restriction on future use of the money?
[00:58:34.022 --> 00:58:35.023]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:58:35.903 --> 00:58:37.724]  It's the social credit score.
[00:58:38.085 --> 00:58:39.005]  Total slavery.
[00:58:39.385 --> 00:58:40.046]  Mark of the Beast.
[00:58:40.506 --> 00:58:42.868]  The chains are going on now.
[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:47.904]  We'll be right back with your phone calls from Canada and other parts of the world.
[00:58:48.485 --> 00:58:56.272]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live February 22nd worldwide transmission.
[00:58:59.095 --> 00:59:00.617]  All right, we're going to go to callers here.
[00:59:01.698 --> 00:59:06.543]  We've got Max in Canada, Matt in Canada, Scott in Canada, Scott in Australia.
[00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:16.397]  Mike in Canada, Terry in Nova Scotia, Canada, Jim in Ontario, Canada, Velvet in Ontario, Canada, Jeff in Winnipeg, Jeff in Windsor.
[00:59:16.458 --> 00:59:20.181]  I'm going to try, no matter how great your calls are, to give each person a minute and a half.
[00:59:20.281 --> 00:59:21.963]  No need to thank me.
[00:59:22.003 --> 00:59:22.703]  I won't thank you.
[00:59:22.723 --> 00:59:24.145]  I just want to get everybody on.
[00:59:24.165 --> 00:59:24.966]  You're all awesome.
[00:59:24.986 --> 00:59:25.386]  I love you.
[00:59:25.886 --> 00:59:27.288]  We're just going to hear what you have to say.
[00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:32.254]  And so we've got truckers that were at the protest in Australia, truckers that were at the protest in Canada.
[00:59:32.274 --> 00:59:33.635]  We've got everybody.
[00:59:33.675 --> 00:59:40.541]  Let's go to folks furthest away right now, where they're attacking people with LRAD machines and declaring everybody terrorists.
[00:59:40.661 --> 00:59:44.464]  Scott in Australia, current lockdown protest.
[00:59:44.864 --> 00:59:45.245]  Thank you.
[00:59:45.285 --> 00:59:46.506]  Give us your view on what's happening.
[00:59:48.187 --> 00:59:48.828]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:59:49.348 --> 00:59:51.250]  It's a pleasure to speak with you, Paul.
[00:59:52.377 --> 00:59:55.559]  Yeah, look, it's getting worse and worse here, Alex.
[00:59:55.599 --> 01:00:02.762]  They take their foot off for a moment and everyone feels like there's a bit of a reprieve and everything's back to normal.
[01:00:02.822 --> 01:00:11.366]  But if you don't have your double or triple backs, you can't go anywhere, you can't do anything, it's getting worse and worse, mate.
[01:00:11.406 --> 01:00:14.828]  We all need to really get everyone's attention now.
[01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:25.676]  Well that's right, France just deactivated the vaccine passport after claiming two shots was enough and says you can't now have a job or leave your house or go to a grocery store unless you've had three shots.
[01:00:25.716 --> 01:00:30.599]  This is literally dog training for the government to put in us what they want, when they want.
[01:00:30.859 --> 01:00:34.041]  This is like a science fiction nightmare dystopic movie.
[01:00:35.148 --> 01:00:36.589]  It's exactly what it is.
[01:00:36.749 --> 01:00:38.149]  It's their oppression going mad.
[01:00:38.229 --> 01:00:43.852]  It's their slow way to keep their foot on the pedal without anyone really complaining about it.
[01:00:44.232 --> 01:00:49.654]  And just the general population, no one's complaining.
[01:00:49.674 --> 01:00:51.255]  Everyone's just going along with everything.
[01:00:51.675 --> 01:00:55.257]   And we're getting to a point where What can we do?
[01:00:55.437 --> 01:00:56.938]  How do we push back?
[01:00:56.978 --> 01:00:59.719]  Well, brother, it's so outrageous, that's how it's got a leg up.
[01:00:59.759 --> 01:01:01.460]  But you've got support around the world.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.581]  Millions of Aussies have been protesting.
[01:01:03.941 --> 01:01:09.523]  I know they're gaslighting you, but as the medical problems are caused by the shots, people are starting to wake up.
[01:01:10.063 --> 01:01:12.384]  And, you know, there's a worldwide movement, sir, so God bless you.
[01:01:12.424 --> 01:01:13.785]  Anything else from Australia?
[01:01:14.884 --> 01:01:16.246]  Look, just keep up the fight.
[01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:17.867]  You've been doing this for so long.
[01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:22.212]  The information for me, it's really woken me up.
[01:01:22.252 --> 01:01:24.415]  So, thank you from all of us.
[01:01:24.755 --> 01:01:25.496]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:01:25.536 --> 01:01:26.377]  We're all in this together.
[01:01:26.397 --> 01:01:26.897]  Thank you.
[01:01:27.778 --> 01:01:29.120]  One country falls, we all fall.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.222]  And a lot of countries are falling right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:31.863 --> 01:01:34.546]  People knock America all day, but notice, it didn't work here.
[01:01:35.586 --> 01:01:36.767]  She'll have some checks and balances.
[01:01:36.787 --> 01:01:40.010]  Other places, it's bad, and it only gets worse the more you submit.
[01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:44.854]  The worst part about the first 15 days of Flatten the Curve is the first two years.
[01:01:45.915 --> 01:01:48.277]  And what do unvaccinated and vaccinated have in common?
[01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:49.578]  You're never fully vaccinated.
[01:01:50.839 --> 01:01:51.800]  Let's go to Carlos.
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:56.584]  We'll go to Carlos next, but let's go to a trucker in Canada.
[01:01:57.004 --> 01:01:59.006]  Let's go to Scott in Canada.
[01:01:59.026 --> 01:01:59.787]  You're on the air, Scott.
[01:01:59.807 --> 01:02:00.087]  Go ahead.
[01:02:01.508 --> 01:02:03.669]  Yes, I was at the front lines here in Ottawa.
[01:02:04.049 --> 01:02:05.650]  Um, I guess where do I start?
[01:02:06.551 --> 01:02:13.634]  Um, there was definitely foreign cops that were there.
[01:02:14.235 --> 01:02:15.515]  Um, I have lots of good videos.
[01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:19.017]  Um, they attacked us right beside us.
[01:02:19.037 --> 01:02:24.880]  They shot, they shot the rebel, a female rebel news reporter point blank with a tear gas canister.
[01:02:26.281 --> 01:02:29.388]   Um, They attacked us unprovoked.
[01:02:29.408 --> 01:02:33.129]  They were definitely using weapons that I'm not even really sure about.
[01:02:33.169 --> 01:02:36.490]  I've never really been a part of a military operation before, but it definitely was.
[01:02:38.650 --> 01:02:40.270]  They made us sick.
[01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:42.511]  My stomach was upset.
[01:02:42.711 --> 01:02:44.331]  I instantly got a headache.
[01:02:45.571 --> 01:02:46.292]  I'm not exactly sure.
[01:02:46.312 --> 01:02:51.373]  Well, they're on record that they had ultrasonic, ultra-high frequency sound, but they also had microwaves there.
[01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:53.713]  Seriously illegal under the Geneva Convention.
[01:02:54.617 --> 01:02:55.897]  Oh, they definitely did.
[01:02:56.417 --> 01:02:57.518]  I could physically feel it.
[01:02:57.558 --> 01:02:58.178]  It was odd.
[01:02:58.438 --> 01:02:59.318]  Instantly, right away.
[01:02:59.338 --> 01:03:04.679]  The cops were hitting women, batoning women in the face.
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.380]  It was unbelievable.
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:09.980]  No markings on their chest.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.641]  Now, some cops had markings on their chest.
[01:03:11.661 --> 01:03:13.141]  You could tell that they were local cops.
[01:03:13.341 --> 01:03:15.001]  There were Calgary cops, Toronto cops.
[01:03:16.502 --> 01:03:18.542]  But then there were cops that were dressed up in green.
[01:03:19.344 --> 01:03:27.295]  They had no names, they had no badges, no indication of where they came from, not even Canadian logos that were Canadian police.
[01:03:29.953 --> 01:03:35.777]  Well, I mean, I've seen what people can do, and I know what you can do with a billy club when you slam it, both hands, full power into somebody's head.
[01:03:36.037 --> 01:03:37.098]  That's how you kill somebody.
[01:03:37.759 --> 01:03:39.480]  I mean, I'm not bragging.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.642]  I'm actually, people started the fights with me, but I'm not proud of it.
[01:03:41.962 --> 01:03:50.809]  I mean, I've put people in comas twice with my fist, and I just know you can't be slamming billy clubs, double fisted into somebody's head with full power.
[01:03:51.049 --> 01:03:54.312]  You can punch a hole, create a subdermal hematoma.
[01:03:54.612 --> 01:03:56.974]  They were trying to kill some of those people who were peaceful.
[01:03:57.014 --> 01:03:57.695]  This is sick.
[01:03:59.158 --> 01:04:01.119]  Yeah, well, each day I was hit with a baton.
[01:04:01.539 --> 01:04:10.684]  Now, me and my brother were there standing side by side and we're fairly... I'm 6'6", 300 pounds, so they didn't do too much damage to us.
[01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:14.766]  I noticed they beat up a lot of women and really little old men and handicaps.
[01:04:15.146 --> 01:04:16.187]  It was very embarrassing.
[01:04:17.307 --> 01:04:18.228]  Oh, it's disgusting.
[01:04:18.268 --> 01:04:21.049]  It was the most disgusting display I've ever seen in my lifetime.
[01:04:23.482 --> 01:04:29.706]  Well, what do you make of them arresting the leaders for peacefully protesting and saying no bail and 10 years in prison?
[01:04:29.726 --> 01:04:31.847]  I mean, that's right out of the Soviet Union.
[01:04:33.188 --> 01:04:35.370]  Oh, we've went way over to the deep end now.
[01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:37.931]  We're a full-fledged communist, fascist country.
[01:04:38.432 --> 01:04:39.632]  I don't know how else to explain it.
[01:04:40.053 --> 01:04:42.154]  How else can you peacefully protest?
[01:04:42.174 --> 01:04:49.679]  The one guy they're not going to release either, Pat King, and he wasn't even in Ottawa or downtown when they arrested him.
[01:04:52.441 --> 01:04:58.803]  And you look at the police officer arresting the leader, the lady, who did nothing wrong, and it's just so creepy.
[01:04:58.823 --> 01:05:03.125]  And of course, she thought she'd be right out because she's a famous liberal demonstrator who believes in free speech.
[01:05:03.665 --> 01:05:08.087]  No, lady, you're facing a year before trial and 10 years in prison for peacefully protesting.
[01:05:08.387 --> 01:05:09.888]  Let that sink in, folks.
[01:05:09.908 --> 01:05:10.928]  They want to terrorize us.
[01:05:11.228 --> 01:05:11.868]  They want to scare us.
[01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:13.229]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:05:13.928 --> 01:05:16.450]  Does everybody think they're doing this just to stop a few people?
[01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.630]  No.
[01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:23.996]  They're getting ready for a worldwide financial collapse and a takeover, and they want to get martial law in place and have everybody accept it first.
[01:05:24.397 --> 01:05:25.738]  We're all just the beta test.
[01:05:25.758 --> 01:05:26.819]  What do you say to that, Scott?
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.421]  Oh, they're going for broke, in my opinion.
[01:05:29.441 --> 01:05:30.642]  This is them going for broke.
[01:05:31.062 --> 01:05:34.745]  Like, we literally had cops in the front line that were attacking us.
[01:05:34.785 --> 01:05:35.706]  We weren't fighting back.
[01:05:36.066 --> 01:05:39.409]  They were attacking us and telling us through our face, oh, we don't want to do this.
[01:05:39.489 --> 01:05:40.230]  We don't want to do this.
[01:05:40.590 --> 01:05:42.952]  While minions behind them are attacking us with billy clubs.
[01:05:43.707 --> 01:05:47.488]  I guess our leaders are grasping at straws.
[01:05:47.508 --> 01:05:50.549]  Now our leaders are acting like they're, oh, well, we're going to drop.
[01:05:50.569 --> 01:05:52.209]  We always want to drop these restrictions.
[01:05:52.749 --> 01:05:53.349]  This and that.
[01:05:53.369 --> 01:06:00.351]  And our conservative premier, Doug Ford, acting like, oh, well, you know, I didn't want to do this, this and that.
[01:06:00.371 --> 01:06:01.552]  And that's not at all.
[01:06:02.052 --> 01:06:04.312]  It's also election season, too, right?
[01:06:04.432 --> 01:06:06.833]  So it's all a big game, in my opinion.
[01:06:07.453 --> 01:06:08.033]  They're failing.
[01:06:08.113 --> 01:06:09.233]  God bless you, Scott.
[01:06:09.314 --> 01:06:09.894]  And be safe.
[01:06:09.914 --> 01:06:18.134]   We need to pray for The people that have disappeared without charges, without bail, and the judge is saying we're going to hold them in solitary confinement.
[01:06:18.154 --> 01:06:21.356]  This should make everybody physically sick.
[01:06:21.376 --> 01:06:23.697]  I mean, you should be physically nauseous.
[01:06:24.157 --> 01:06:27.019]  And that's the feeling you have when you know you're going into a real crisis.
[01:06:27.039 --> 01:06:29.180]  You get sick because you're about to get in a really bad fight.
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:29.820]  You throw up.
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.021]  You'll get your stomach clear.
[01:06:31.041 --> 01:06:34.903]  I mean, that's why I'm physically at a cellular level, like ready for a fight.
[01:06:35.203 --> 01:06:36.904]  But I'm not going to start one physical at this point.
[01:06:37.785 --> 01:07:05.104]  The new axis of evil is the United Nations controlled by private central banks and BlackRock with their public organization, the World Economic Forum, funding and financing thousands of governors and premiers around the world and over a hundred presidents and prime ministers under their command bringing in a worldwide environmental lockdown to bankrupt industrial society to force depopulation in their own words.
[01:07:06.741 --> 01:07:10.082]  And almost every country signed on to this, just to even have a seat at the table.
[01:07:10.482 --> 01:07:16.424]  I'm not saying everybody that's part of this, like Tulsi Gabbards, or even people like Dan Crenshaw, are bad.
[01:07:16.444 --> 01:07:18.004]  You've got to judge them by their fruits.
[01:07:18.784 --> 01:07:21.945]  Vladimir Putin has been to these things, but not a graduate.
[01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:25.726]  Russia joins Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network.
[01:07:26.807 --> 01:07:28.927]  So Russia is signing up to this stuff as well.
[01:07:29.607 --> 01:07:30.928]  And this is a post-human world.
[01:07:30.968 --> 01:07:32.128]  This is transhumanism.
[01:07:32.668 --> 01:07:33.768]  And it's like an arms race.
[01:07:33.909 --> 01:07:35.049]  All these groups are doing it.
[01:07:35.708 --> 01:07:42.633]  But the globalists have launched it to now take over our bodies and put gene therapies in us when they want and then cover up all the illnesses and deaths.
[01:07:43.994 --> 01:07:45.235]  So incredibly dangerous.
[01:07:45.255 --> 01:07:50.559]  And now Democrats and national polls and members of Congress are saying, if any trucks show up in D.C.
[01:07:50.639 --> 01:07:54.742]  even peacefully and honk their horns, arrest them, take their trucks and put them in prison.
[01:07:55.963 --> 01:07:57.425]  And then the long tyranny comes.
[01:07:57.505 --> 01:08:00.927]  And next, well, you didn't turn your kid over for transgender training.
[01:08:01.067 --> 01:08:01.808]  We're putting you in jail.
[01:08:02.521 --> 01:08:03.421]  Oh, you honked your horn.
[01:08:03.741 --> 01:08:06.262]  That means Heil Hitler, says the ADL up in Canada.
[01:08:06.482 --> 01:08:07.503]  They want you arrested for that.
[01:08:07.543 --> 01:08:07.983]  I'm not kidding.
[01:08:08.263 --> 01:08:09.083]  They said it in Parliament.
[01:08:10.544 --> 01:08:15.345]  So what we have is globalist agents literally taking over and turning us into an open-air prison.
[01:08:16.265 --> 01:08:17.786]  Let's rush through your phone calls here.
[01:08:18.566 --> 01:08:21.007]  Let's go to Velvet in Toronto, Canada.
[01:08:21.967 --> 01:08:22.688]  Velvet, welcome.
[01:08:23.628 --> 01:08:25.128]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:08:25.388 --> 01:08:26.889]  Well, I'm not doing too well.
[01:08:26.929 --> 01:08:27.989]  I'm watching it all come true.
[01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:30.050]  Well, hey honey, I'm living it.
[01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:33.822]  So, I would first like to say, uh, honk.
[01:08:34.383 --> 01:08:38.747]  Uh, how that can be an acronym for Hitler, H-O-N-K, I have no idea.
[01:08:38.807 --> 01:08:39.828]  Well, I mean, she knows that.
[01:08:39.889 --> 01:08:45.875]  She just says, I control all language, I'm your cult leader, everything you do I say is racist, so don't talk, keep your mouth shut.
[01:08:46.996 --> 01:08:51.801]  Yes, but in return, what happens is it makes- The woman is a threat to freedom.
[01:08:52.241 --> 01:08:52.482]  Go ahead.
[01:08:53.467 --> 01:08:57.630]  Yeah, but she looks like an idiot by saying that.
[01:08:57.690 --> 01:09:01.552]  Except she'll have you arrested without bond.
[01:09:02.492 --> 01:09:03.413]  Well, that's true.
[01:09:04.133 --> 01:09:06.315]  Well, we're already slaves up here anyhow.
[01:09:06.835 --> 01:09:13.139]  I mean, just on a side note here, our carbon tax, we actually pay a tax on our carbon tax.
[01:09:13.659 --> 01:09:14.519]  So we're double taxed.
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:16.921]  That's right, and it all goes to private banks.
[01:09:16.941 --> 01:09:17.561]  What do you think of that?
[01:09:18.282 --> 01:09:19.442]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:20.403]  Or in their pockets.
[01:09:21.699 --> 01:09:35.683]   Um, but you know, I don't think that anything is really going to change until the media gets taken under control because you would not believe how many people are still I'm MKUltra-ed by all of this.
[01:09:36.044 --> 01:09:37.704]  I am flabbergasted.
[01:09:37.784 --> 01:09:42.265]  Every time I go out, I am still the only person in the store that is not wearing a mask.
[01:09:42.625 --> 01:09:46.666]  I got kicked off of a local platform for supporting the truckers.
[01:09:47.046 --> 01:09:50.667]  I mean, these people are just... I've never seen anything like it.
[01:09:50.767 --> 01:09:55.928]  And, you know, I'm wondering if these shots that people are taking are affecting their brain.
[01:09:57.338 --> 01:10:02.979]  Well, I mean, they are causing blood clots and are causing the blood consistency to change and causing a lot of health problems.
[01:10:02.999 --> 01:10:05.459]  But yeah, people are going under a delusion.
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:07.340]  Here's how Stockholm Syndrome works.
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:12.601]  You subconsciously know you're under tyranny, but it's so scary you decide to say it's okay.
[01:10:14.061 --> 01:10:18.362]  And that's historically why women and children don't get killed when a foreign government takes over.
[01:10:18.382 --> 01:10:22.863]  They just kill the men, 12 and up, because men don't go under Stockholm Syndrome as easy.
[01:10:23.543 --> 01:10:24.423]  And I'm not putting women down.
[01:10:24.443 --> 01:10:25.423]  It's just a scientific fact.
[01:10:26.391 --> 01:10:29.053]  But most men today go under Stockholm Syndrome as well.
[01:10:29.393 --> 01:10:32.895]  They make excuses for what's happening and don't admit what's happening to them.
[01:10:32.935 --> 01:10:33.675]  Thank you, Velvet.
[01:10:34.255 --> 01:10:45.562]  You know, the way to deal with your media is to realize that when Trudeau got in, he began giving $600 million a year to select media outlets to make them state-run.
[01:10:45.642 --> 01:10:51.165]  But that was really so they could then have certified groups they're allowed to post and nobody else is.
[01:10:52.366 --> 01:10:54.467]  And now that's being put in officially.
[01:10:55.467 --> 01:11:00.512]  Alright, let's go to Jeff in Winnipeg, Canada, on the total police state beyond lockdown.
[01:11:00.753 --> 01:11:01.714]  What do you mean by that, Jeff?
[01:11:02.922 --> 01:11:10.287]  Oh, I don't even know where to begin or how to even organize all my thoughts on this topic in Canada.
[01:11:10.327 --> 01:11:18.211]  But with what you have to say about the state-run media, like there is no dissenting opinions on the TV.
[01:11:18.852 --> 01:11:26.456]  Everybody, when they're watching the news, eating dinner, it's just, it's like Black Mirror style propaganda.
[01:11:26.957 --> 01:11:28.017]  And I'm 22 years old.
[01:11:29.935 --> 01:11:33.797]  And it's it's like it's like I'm an alien.
[01:11:33.837 --> 01:11:39.460]  It's like I'm the only person in, you know, in my community that that thinks otherwise.
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:45.923]  And then and like I don't want to get into my personal life too much, but I like I'm unvaccinated.
[01:11:45.983 --> 01:11:50.605]  I haven't been to a bar or a restaurant in more than two years now.
[01:11:51.725 --> 01:11:57.928]  Certain fast food places, they have signs up on their doors saying unvaccinated people can't use their washrooms.
[01:11:59.858 --> 01:12:10.327]  I didn't want to, I didn't want to, like girls that I was romantically involved with, I didn't want to come across as crazy and raise, you know, the New World Order agenda with them.
[01:12:10.347 --> 01:12:17.033]  I didn't want to come across as a crazy person, but now I can't find a single girl my age that hasn't had at least two shots.
[01:12:18.302 --> 01:12:19.462]  Well, it's very, very sad.
[01:12:19.522 --> 01:12:20.263]  Here's what you need to know.
[01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:23.483]  Most of the shots, it's Russian roulette, are placebo.
[01:12:23.963 --> 01:12:25.123]  They send out the deadly shots.
[01:12:25.183 --> 01:12:28.664]  It looks out to about 3-4% of the people all over the world.
[01:12:28.684 --> 01:12:29.464]  It's the same in Europe.
[01:12:30.525 --> 01:12:32.225]  Like, old folks' homes get the kill shots.
[01:12:32.405 --> 01:12:33.745]  Military gets the kill shots.
[01:12:34.545 --> 01:12:36.126]  Groups they want to purge get the kill shots.
[01:12:36.186 --> 01:12:40.667]  So, it's all very systematic, but you're still taking your life in your hands.
[01:12:41.107 --> 01:12:41.987]  Jeff, great points.
[01:12:42.047 --> 01:12:44.327]  We could talk to you for hours, but we've got to move on to get everybody in.
[01:12:45.127 --> 01:12:45.628]  Okay.
[01:12:46.928 --> 01:12:47.348]  Up next.
[01:12:48.513 --> 01:12:50.915]  Let's talk to Terry in Nova Scotia, Canada.
[01:12:51.275 --> 01:12:55.898]  Let's talk about Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Ukraine connections.
[01:12:55.938 --> 01:13:04.243]  Yeah, her grandfather was the head Nazi out of Ukraine running Joseph Goebbels operations in Poland and in Austria.
[01:13:04.744 --> 01:13:16.453]   He was in command of He was the direct lieutenant of Joseph Goebbels, and now she works directly for Klaus Schwab, whose grandfather was the number four or five weapons dealer in Nazi Germany.
[01:13:16.493 --> 01:13:18.234]  So this is a very nice group of people.
[01:13:18.734 --> 01:13:19.335]  Go ahead, Terry.
[01:13:20.635 --> 01:13:22.196]  Yeah, you're 100% right, Alex.
[01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:35.125]  And in the 1980s, according to her Wikipedia page, the early life section on her Wikipedia page, in the 1980s, she was a Ukrainian activist in Russia, and Russia was upset about this, and I think it might have kicked her out.
[01:13:36.094 --> 01:13:37.895]  Um, but that was the 1980s.
[01:13:37.915 --> 01:13:38.895]  Now fast forward to 2017.
[01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:40.476]  Oh yeah, no, no.
[01:13:40.536 --> 01:13:44.117]  She's CIA all the way, but again, the CIA is only a holding group.
[01:13:44.318 --> 01:13:45.518]  There's corporate groups above them.
[01:13:45.538 --> 01:13:47.179]  I mean, she's a high-level spy.
[01:13:47.579 --> 01:13:49.059]  She's been a spy since she was a kid.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:14:01.184]  In mainstream Canadian media in 2018-19, they, mainstream media, saying the Canadian military is over in the Ukraine working with neo-Nazi battalions, according to the Canadian mainstream media.
[01:14:01.344 --> 01:14:01.505]  Yeah.
[01:14:01.845 --> 01:14:04.166]  No, no, she runs neo-Nazi battalions.
[01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:04.826]  Yeah, go ahead, sorry.
[01:14:05.839 --> 01:14:25.107]   Yeah, and Ukraine absorbed those battalions into their official military, apparently, according to the media, and now we're giving them more funding, more weapons, and while we're working with literal neo-Nazis across the, on the other side of the globe, over here in Canada, Our politicians and media are calling our citizens Nazis, brother.
[01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:26.268]  They're calling good truckers.
[01:14:26.508 --> 01:14:28.449]  One of the top truckers in Canada, Warren Garrison.
[01:14:28.469 --> 01:14:30.270]  They're trying to peg him as some sort of criminal.
[01:14:30.330 --> 01:14:31.171]  Yeah, whatever.
[01:14:31.451 --> 01:14:33.912]  Well, W, you heard the ADL lady up there.
[01:14:34.352 --> 01:14:35.853]  She said arrest anybody honking their horn.
[01:14:35.873 --> 01:14:36.674]  It means Hal Hitler.
[01:14:37.054 --> 01:14:39.015]  She'll put you in a forced labor camp in two seconds, brother.
[01:14:40.116 --> 01:14:42.057]  You've got a case of V.I.
[01:14:42.097 --> 01:14:42.917]  Lennon up there.
[01:14:43.238 --> 01:14:44.278]  And we've got it here, too.
[01:14:44.738 --> 01:14:47.260]  And these people know we've woken up to them, so they're coming after us.
[01:14:48.844 --> 01:14:53.246]  The information and misinformation war is really scary to me up here, Alex.
[01:14:53.306 --> 01:14:53.906]  I just want to thank you.
[01:14:53.926 --> 01:14:57.648]  I first found you when W. Bush was president, brother, and you've been keeping it real the whole time.
[01:14:57.688 --> 01:14:58.648]  I won't take up too much of your time.
[01:14:58.688 --> 01:15:01.689]  No, you're not taking my time, but we really appreciate you calling, Terry.
[01:15:01.749 --> 01:15:03.130]  I mean, how do you think this ends?
[01:15:03.190 --> 01:15:06.431]  Has this awoken the sleeping giant in Canada, or what's happening?
[01:15:08.932 --> 01:15:11.493]  I'm scared they're just going to crush us completely, brother, honestly.
[01:15:11.813 --> 01:15:12.613]  That's what I'm scared about.
[01:15:13.494 --> 01:15:16.095]  Well, Trudeau says he's an example of the world of how to crush people.
[01:15:17.498 --> 01:15:18.440]  We're seeing history repeat.
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:22.745]  Can you believe they've arrested a bunch of the people and aren't giving them bonds, saying they're terrorists?
[01:15:24.528 --> 01:15:25.970]  It's so scary.
[01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:27.392]  And these aren't bad people.
[01:15:27.432 --> 01:15:28.954]  In Canada, we're not Nazis.
[01:15:28.994 --> 01:15:30.115]  We don't like any of that stuff.
[01:15:30.215 --> 01:15:31.317]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:15:31.337 --> 01:15:33.420]  The people that actually are Nazis are running this.
[01:15:34.526 --> 01:15:34.926]  They are.
[01:15:34.966 --> 01:15:36.888]  They're the Nazis and they're calling us Nazis.
[01:15:36.948 --> 01:15:37.768]  It's crazy, brother.
[01:15:37.868 --> 01:15:39.209]  And it's scary.
[01:15:39.249 --> 01:15:39.869]  Very scary.
[01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:43.912]  Well, you know, to all the Canadians going along with it and others, this is going to take all your resources.
[01:15:43.932 --> 01:15:47.013]  You're going to be in a much worse place, but people got to learn.
[01:15:47.033 --> 01:15:48.474]  They got to get hurt really bad first.
[01:15:49.415 --> 01:15:50.676]  We're praying for everybody up in Canada.
[01:15:51.176 --> 01:15:52.016]  All right, Terry, thank you.
[01:15:52.036 --> 01:15:53.317]  Almost all these calls are from Canada.
[01:15:53.357 --> 01:15:58.360]  We're going to keep lines open for folks in Europe and Australia and other sectors of tyranny.
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:15:59.061]  Stay with us.
[01:15:59.081 --> 01:15:59.581]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:04.303]  All right, folks, I'm going to continue with your calls into the third hour.
[01:16:06.525 --> 01:16:11.129]  Then we got a very special interview in the fourth hour, I'll tell you about coming up a little bit later.
[01:16:13.150 --> 01:16:18.154]  But I'm telling you, folks, everything John Bowne does, one of our great researchers and reporters, is powerful.
[01:16:18.174 --> 01:16:26.381]  But the last three reports he put out, when you go to Bandot Video, click on the left hand side, you'll see the John Bowne section right there, are just incredible.
[01:16:26.942 --> 01:16:28.523]  New Zealand, great reset tyranny.
[01:16:29.268 --> 01:16:33.868]  Australian Great Reset Tyranny and Canadian Great Reset Tyranny.
[01:16:33.868 --> 01:16:38.988]   They're all five-minute reports or four-minute and 50-something second reports.
[01:16:38.988 --> 01:16:43.988]   And they are just unbelievable. I mean, you watch that and it's like...
[01:16:43.988 --> 01:16:48.068]   I mean, I'll be honest, I kind of get guilty doing it sometimes because it upsets me,
[01:16:48.068 --> 01:16:52.627]  but it's also fascinating to watch North Korean tyranny.
[01:16:52.753 --> 01:16:55.955]  And you feel so sorry for them, but it's also ridiculous in a way.
[01:16:55.995 --> 01:16:59.678]  And it's so alien that they put up with that, but they were born into it.
[01:17:00.198 --> 01:17:02.920]  And then you watch these and it's worse in a way.
[01:17:04.862 --> 01:17:07.862]  And it's just like, oh my gosh.
[01:17:07.862 --> 01:17:15.862]   I'm going to go to your phone calls here and get a bunch of them out of the way.
[01:17:15.862 --> 01:17:25.862]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:17:17.381 --> 01:17:21.144]  And then I do need to get some into Russia and what's happening over there in some of these Putin clubs.
[01:17:23.046 --> 01:17:25.568]  Like I said, I'm going to do some nighttime shows soon.
[01:17:25.628 --> 01:17:28.410]  I've already been doing Saturday shows where I can do commercial free.
[01:17:28.891 --> 01:17:30.732]  Millions of people tune in, so it's very humbling.
[01:17:30.752 --> 01:17:34.555]  You know, we can come in here any time, do two or three hours live.
[01:17:35.646 --> 01:17:39.990]  Get all the great calls and guests and just have no breaks and talk radio is still great while we're still on air.
[01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:43.352]  But I really enjoy just going for hours and not having a break.
[01:17:45.274 --> 01:17:55.562]  We can really talk to everybody then, but I want to air that whole Putin speech because I watched it last night after my four and a half year old daughter went to bed about nine.
[01:17:56.843 --> 01:17:58.444]  And I wrote some notes and of course I forgot them.
[01:17:58.464 --> 01:18:04.109]  They were at my bedside and it was just incredible because what Putin was saying was all true.
[01:18:05.771 --> 01:18:07.712]  Not from what he says, but from my own research.
[01:18:07.852 --> 01:18:13.114]  And to juxtapose that to what we've got here was night and day.
[01:18:17.816 --> 01:18:18.616]  So it's a big deal.
[01:18:19.817 --> 01:18:21.878]  So we're going to be doing some special reports on that as well.
[01:18:22.098 --> 01:18:23.358]  I'm just going to say this very briefly.
[01:18:24.399 --> 01:18:25.759]  We have products you really need.
[01:18:25.799 --> 01:18:27.160]  Like our information's cutting edge.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.320]  Our products are amazing.
[01:18:28.961 --> 01:18:30.901]  And there are three products I want to draw your attention to.
[01:18:30.921 --> 01:18:31.882]  Then we'll go right back to your calls.
[01:18:35.117 --> 01:18:39.599]  That's X3, that's Winter Sun, and that's Brain Force Ultra.
[01:18:39.619 --> 01:18:44.542]  And in the time we have, I'm not going to belabor this, but these are really amazing.
[01:18:44.762 --> 01:18:47.904]  X3 is 50% off until Thursday morning.
[01:18:49.605 --> 01:18:51.446]  It's going to sell out in the next month or so.
[01:18:51.466 --> 01:18:54.447]  So we're going to take it to close to full price so I can fund my operation.
[01:18:54.707 --> 01:18:59.390]  But I want you to experience it and get it so you know how amazing it is and how you were missing out on a real iodine in your life.
[01:19:02.012 --> 01:19:04.333]  It's 50% off at InfoWorksStore.com.
[01:19:04.933 --> 01:19:10.736]  We also have Brain Force Ultra, quick acting, powerful, clean, and it wears off quick.
[01:19:10.756 --> 01:19:11.396]  That's why I like it.
[01:19:11.416 --> 01:19:14.998]  If I need 10 hours of clean, powerful, super energy, I got Turbo Force.
[01:19:15.378 --> 01:19:19.299]  I need four or five hours of good clarity that doesn't give me a headache later, that's Brain Force.
[01:19:19.319 --> 01:19:20.060]  They're different formulas.
[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:26.483]  This super fast acting, take it under the tongue, and then for me, two and a half, three hours, and the rest of the office has used it and loves it.
[01:19:26.683 --> 01:19:27.743]  If you leave it out, it disappears.
[01:19:30.234 --> 01:19:36.517]  It dissipates quickly, so I can take it at 7 at night, but I've got to do interviews or go out to dinner with folks, and I want to go out, but I'm tired.
[01:19:37.137 --> 01:19:38.438]  You know, Joe Rogan's like, hey, let's go get dinner.
[01:19:38.458 --> 01:19:39.718]  I'm like, oh man, it's 7 o'clock.
[01:19:39.738 --> 01:19:40.579]  Okay, sure, I'll see you.
[01:19:41.119 --> 01:19:43.760]  And coffee, by the afternoon, doesn't really kick in anymore.
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.641]  In fact, coffee, I can drink coffee and go to sleep.
[01:19:45.961 --> 01:19:46.962]  My brain's used to it.
[01:19:47.422 --> 01:19:48.442]  You know, the receptors.
[01:19:49.083 --> 01:19:49.723]  Not with this.
[01:19:51.324 --> 01:19:54.325]  I can take a half drop of that, boy, and I'm super excited.
[01:19:54.861 --> 01:19:56.883]  When I would go out with friends and family.
[01:19:56.903 --> 01:19:59.204]  Went out with the MTG Sunday night.
[01:19:59.324 --> 01:20:00.465]  I was super exhausted.
[01:20:01.006 --> 01:20:01.686]  Popped that back.
[01:20:02.307 --> 01:20:02.807]  Felt great.
[01:20:02.907 --> 01:20:04.128]  Was able to go to bed when I got home.
[01:20:04.749 --> 01:20:05.669]  Like 9.30 at night.
[01:20:05.749 --> 01:20:05.949]  Boom.
[01:20:05.969 --> 01:20:06.490]  Hit that pillow.
[01:20:07.299 --> 01:20:07.919]  It's amazing.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.864]  Infowarstore.com and Wintersun, super high quality vitamin D3 for your immune system and more with vitamin K. The two work synergistically.
[01:20:15.224 --> 01:20:19.406]  It's 50% off as well right now at Infowarstore.com.
[01:20:19.526 --> 01:20:25.570]  And the Wintersun and the Rainforest Ultra, that's going to stay on sale at 40-50% off for a few weeks.
[01:20:26.411 --> 01:20:27.251]  We've got a good supply.
[01:20:27.691 --> 01:20:30.953]  The X3 is going to end Thursday morning.
[01:20:31.234 --> 01:20:32.074]  All right, enough of that.
[01:20:32.474 --> 01:20:33.315]  That's how we stay on air.
[01:20:34.841 --> 01:20:36.462]  Let's talk to Carlos in Canada.
[01:20:36.502 --> 01:20:37.903]  He's been a caller for 15 years.
[01:20:38.603 --> 01:20:42.526]  Let's talk about Trudeau, puppet of Klaus Schwab, and the Democratic Party.
[01:20:43.206 --> 01:20:45.047]  And then we'll go to everybody else, and I appreciate everybody holding.
[01:20:45.127 --> 01:20:47.068]  Canada is on fire with tyranny right now.
[01:20:47.589 --> 01:20:49.310]  It is on fire with liberty as well, which scared him.
[01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:50.591]  Carlos, thank you so much.
[01:20:50.651 --> 01:20:53.672]  What's the 35,000-foot view on what we're seeing?
[01:20:53.712 --> 01:21:01.037]  And are you as shaken as I am by peaceful protesters given no bond, facing 10 years in prison?
[01:21:02.856 --> 01:21:11.679]  Well, no, not really, because I happen to have been blessed by the fact that I knew Prime Minister Trudeau's father, Pierre-Eliot Trudeau.
[01:21:12.259 --> 01:21:17.000]  I met him when I was 16 years old, actually, in Montreal, 1968.
[01:21:18.401 --> 01:21:24.162]  And since that day, I became very well aware of Canada.
[01:21:24.262 --> 01:21:29.484]  I lived through the October crisis, which provoked the War Measures Act.
[01:21:29.992 --> 01:21:38.979]  At that time, there was no other instrument to deal with terrorism of the kind that was taking place in one province, in Canada essentially, Quebec.
[01:21:39.559 --> 01:21:45.544]  And it was a call from the Premier of the province and the Mayor of Montreal to have the War Measures Act.
[01:21:45.584 --> 01:21:46.605]  There was no other instrument.
[01:21:47.105 --> 01:21:56.773]  At that time, the New Democratic Party of Canada was always a third party, a minority government formed.
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.541]  But they voted against the War Measures Act.
[01:22:00.641 --> 01:22:01.482]  It carried anyway.
[01:22:01.882 --> 01:22:07.546]  So for those that don't know, the father and the son have always loved authoritarianism.
[01:22:07.586 --> 01:22:09.307]  They've said it both themselves.
[01:22:09.608 --> 01:22:11.889]  His father began the takeover of Canada.
[01:22:11.929 --> 01:22:12.930]  He appears to be completing it.
[01:22:13.210 --> 01:22:15.432]  What do you make of what's currently happening and where this is all going?
[01:22:16.252 --> 01:22:21.716]  Well, yesterday the motion to confirm the declaration of emergency powers passed 185 votes to 151.
[01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:36.893]  The liberals have 160 seats, and the 25 seats that added to the 185 would have been the New Democratic Party, with the exception of one given by an independent.
[01:22:36.933 --> 01:22:38.875]  That one liberal, I believe, did not vote.
[01:22:39.255 --> 01:22:46.819]  So when you look at it, the New Democratic Party, a small minority in opposition, was in fact responsible for the passage.
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:49.481]  The liberals did not have the votes to carry it.
[01:22:49.501 --> 01:22:56.022]   Okay, and I'm glad you're giving us the tentacles, but I want, as you're a smart guy, been calling for 15 years or so. Why are they doing this?
[01:22:56.022 --> 01:22:57.462]  Why are they accelerating it?
[01:22:57.462 --> 01:23:00.903]   I mean, obviously, they want to set the precedent for this worldwide. But
[01:23:00.903 --> 01:23:05.623]   because you talked to them in the call comment that you want to talk about
[01:23:05.623 --> 01:23:12.262]   Klaus Schwab and what's happening. Well, yes, go, Klaus Schwab. Disciple is actually the leader of
[01:23:12.262 --> 01:23:18.663]   the New Democratic Party. His name is Jacquemus Singh. And the resolution, the motion would have
[01:23:18.663 --> 01:23:24.583]   passed had it not been for the fact that these 25 members of this. That's right. And the Ottawa
[01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:30.743]   mayor is part of it. So it's literally a corporate multinational cult has seized control of your
[01:23:31.489 --> 01:23:32.189]  Unbelievable.
[01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:39.914]  It's a terrible infiltration of Canadian democracy, and I tell all Canadians with respect, do not be afraid.
[01:23:40.464 --> 01:23:42.266]  Look at your right hand, look at your left hand.
[01:23:42.526 --> 01:23:44.348]  That's the one you vote with, okay?
[01:23:44.649 --> 01:23:46.691]  You're a minority and a majority of one.
[01:23:47.131 --> 01:23:54.860]  Use your vote the next time, but get informed, because InfoWars, in a way, is a vaccine against these viral infiltrations.
[01:23:55.365 --> 01:24:11.894]  Okay, I see these political, these secret society movements in Canada, these, what I call the Jewish Defamation League inventions of swastikas and all sorts of allegations against people that really have a right to demonstrate.
[01:24:12.194 --> 01:24:20.078]  And when you really boil it down, the irony of all this is that you had people with a right to demonstrate parking their vehicles illegally.
[01:24:20.458 --> 01:24:24.340]  So they should have had parking tickets, okay, and then towed away.
[01:24:24.933 --> 01:24:50.097]   And to put people in prison beyond that is, first of all, probably illegal, but because he called on the War Measures Act, driven by the global elite, and then you have the new Democratic Party confirming this yesterday, the only solution that Canada has is that there is a Senate And it's supposed to be the conscience of Canada.
[01:24:50.337 --> 01:24:54.860]  And I do hope that the Senators vote this monstrosity down.
[01:24:55.101 --> 01:24:55.501]  Absolutely.
[01:24:55.521 --> 01:24:56.522]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:24:56.542 --> 01:24:59.924]  We need to look into this judge there in Ottawa.
[01:25:03.392 --> 01:25:06.015]  That even though the woman said she wouldn't demonstrate again.
[01:25:06.075 --> 01:25:25.892]  She said nope ten years in jail no bond I mean, this is just as we need to look into this boragos or boragios B-o-u-r-g-e-o-i-s I mean what the hell I mean this person is the new Kim Jong-il so Kim Jong-un It's not just the damn Trudeau.
[01:25:25.972 --> 01:25:33.196]   They have got a pack of out-of-control psychos in your government at every level Yeah, well it's infiltration, big time.
[01:25:33.456 --> 01:25:34.518]  But let me tell you something.
[01:25:34.898 --> 01:25:41.565]  Listen to the speech that you very, very wisely played in InfoWars of the Premier of Alberta.
[01:25:42.186 --> 01:25:43.387]  Listen very, very carefully.
[01:25:43.628 --> 01:25:45.390]  Because that is the Canada that I know.
[01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:47.612]  That is the Canada that I grew up with.
[01:25:48.033 --> 01:25:52.778]  And I tell you, there needs to be a total change, a real clean of the decks.
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:55.221]  Because obviously, people are suffering.
[01:25:55.481 --> 01:25:57.522]  Now, the Constitution of Canada hasn't changed.
[01:25:57.962 --> 01:26:01.103]  Even the French province of... No, no, no.
[01:26:01.143 --> 01:26:02.524]  You've got this globalist takeover.
[01:26:02.564 --> 01:26:03.484]  We're out of time, Carlos.
[01:26:03.524 --> 01:26:04.264]  We'll come back with more calls.
[01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:07.305]  But since you mentioned it, guys, will you dig out the premiere of Alberta?
[01:26:07.345 --> 01:26:08.366]  It's a four and a half minute clip.
[01:26:09.226 --> 01:26:11.128]  We played it Sunday.
[01:26:11.208 --> 01:26:16.071]  It's really powerful, where he just eviscerates the Great Reset.
[01:26:16.432 --> 01:26:17.492]  He's asked about the Great Reset.
[01:26:17.512 --> 01:26:18.153]  See if you can find that.
[01:26:18.173 --> 01:26:19.754]  But regardless, thank you, Carlos.
[01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:21.475]  All right, we're gonna go in the order the calls are received.
[01:26:21.996 --> 01:26:28.100]  Mike in Calgary, Jim, Jeff, Max, Matt.
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:29.081]  We're gonna get to everybody.
[01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:29.541]  Stay with us.
[01:26:30.662 --> 01:26:42.514]   Here's a four and a half minute clip of the Alberta Governor-Premier Jason Kenney, and we're going to come right back from break in five minutes and go to all of the callers, the order they've been received.
[01:26:42.554 --> 01:26:46.896]  I went along with Carlos, but he always has a lot to say.
[01:26:47.377 --> 01:26:50.738]  Here is that very, very important breakdown of what's really happening.
[01:26:51.698 --> 01:26:58.942]  Ricky Butterworth, or it might be Cindy Butterworth, says, where do you stand on the great reset the liberals are planning on introducing?
[01:27:00.222 --> 01:27:04.303]  Well, let me just say that, first of all, what is this Great Reset?
[01:27:07.524 --> 01:27:17.826]  Pierre Polyev, the federal conservative finance critic, recently raised concerns about this and then he was attacked by some in the media and by the liberals for supposedly circulating conspiracy theories.
[01:27:17.946 --> 01:27:24.447]   Well, the Great Reset is actually the name of a book by a very prominent Advocate of it.
[01:27:24.587 --> 01:27:25.888]  It's his name is Klaus Schwab.
[01:27:25.927 --> 01:27:29.648]   He sent me a copy, I guess he sent one to every, probably every government leader around
[01:27:29.648 --> 01:27:31.167]  the world.
[01:27:31.167 --> 01:27:39.367]   And Klaus Schwab's thesis in his book is that we should, governments and societies, the
[01:27:39.367 --> 01:27:47.728]   world, should "seize the opportunity of the public health and economic crisis to re-imagine
[01:27:47.728 --> 01:27:52.847]  the world and radically change policies."
[01:27:52.847 --> 01:27:58.367]   Now in what ways? I would describe it as a grab bag of left-wing ideas for less freedom
[01:27:58.367 --> 01:28:07.646]   and more government. For more government intervention, for policies that would, I think, create massive
[01:28:07.646 --> 01:28:12.887]   poverty, particularly energy policy, policies that he is advocating.
[01:28:12.887 --> 01:28:18.427]   So Klaus Schwab, by the way, is the president and founder of the World Economic Forum, also
[01:28:18.427 --> 01:28:26.966]   known as the Davos Summit. I call it the biggest gathering of global hypocrites in history.
[01:28:26.907 --> 01:28:45.262]  It's a little ski village in Switzerland and every, I think, February, a couple of thousand super rich people, a lot of billionaires, millionaires, global CEOs and politicians fly into Davos with hundreds of private airplanes.
[01:28:45.302 --> 01:28:46.463]  They go into Switzerland.
[01:28:47.023 --> 01:28:55.927]  And they spend a week basically lecturing the rest of the world, including especially working women and men, about how they should reduce their carbon footprint.
[01:28:56.787 --> 01:29:02.009]  The hypocrisy in that crowd is so thick you can't even cut it with a knife.
[01:29:02.669 --> 01:29:09.352]  And so, no, I'm not going to be taking any policy direction from Klaus Schwab or his ilk.
[01:29:10.192 --> 01:29:11.333]  And what I find offensive...
[01:29:12.952 --> 01:29:15.193]  The so-called Great Reset is not a conspiracy theory.
[01:29:15.793 --> 01:29:33.700]  It is an actual set of concrete proposals being advocated by some very influential people, and including, apparently, by Prime Minister Trudeau, who clearly alluded to it, referred to it, quoted from it, the Schwab Theory, in a speech he gave to the United Nations a couple of months ago.
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:36.261]  So, it's not a conspiracy theory to talk about that.
[01:29:36.681 --> 01:29:38.162]  Those are the folks advocating it.
[01:29:39.423 --> 01:29:45.065]  And I think it's perfectly legitimate for democratically elected leaders for me to say, heck no!
[01:29:45.885 --> 01:29:56.628]  We're not going to exploit or take advantage of a crisis to advance a political agenda.
[01:29:58.189 --> 01:30:12.552]   If we're actually all in this together, like we keep saying, then how about we focus on the crisis, on protecting lives and livelihoods, helping people get through this, And how about after that?
[01:30:13.433 --> 01:30:29.606]  Instead of exploiting the crisis to impose on democratic societies a whole bunch of failed socialist policy ideas, how about instead we get refocused on generating economic growth?
[01:30:31.107 --> 01:30:35.371]  On recreating some of the trillions of dollars of wealth that will have been destroyed?
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:40.124]  Of restarting some of the hundreds of thousands of businesses that will have gone under.
[01:30:41.765 --> 01:30:48.732]  Of obsessively focusing on getting the tens of millions around the world back to work.
[01:30:49.493 --> 01:30:53.818]  Those who have suffered most in the COVID era have been the poorest.
[01:30:55.713 --> 01:30:56.454]  Around the world.
[01:30:57.134 --> 01:31:06.120]  So the notion that we would then drive them further into energy poverty through Klaus Schwab's policy agenda is, I just frankly find it offensive.
[01:31:06.621 --> 01:31:09.663]  So no, it's not a conspiracy, and nor is it a conspiracy theory.
[01:31:09.683 --> 01:31:16.107]  I think it's just very distasteful and regrettable.
[01:31:16.127 --> 01:31:17.168]  I'll fade him down.
[01:31:17.208 --> 01:31:19.790]  Jason Kinney needs to be the leader of Canada.
[01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:22.411]  And yeah, it's what it is, it's mass murder.
[01:31:23.172 --> 01:31:41.252]  Great Resets Mass Marker.
[01:31:42.064 --> 01:31:46.026]  Winter Sun is the highest quality organic vitamin D3 taken out of the tongue.
[01:31:46.066 --> 01:31:49.308]  It also has vitamin K, critical for your immune system and so much more.
[01:31:49.901 --> 01:31:54.604]  It's 50% off despite the fact it's going to sell out very, very quickly because everybody needs this.
[01:31:55.284 --> 01:31:57.025]  Old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[01:31:57.125 --> 01:31:58.726]  You need what's in Winter Sun.
[01:31:58.766 --> 01:32:01.508]  And then we have Brain Force Ultra.
[01:32:01.968 --> 01:32:11.053]  Super fast acting, amazing, clean, nootropic system that is a compliment to Brain Force Plus and of course Turbo Force.
[01:32:11.474 --> 01:32:15.236]  All three of these are different formulas, but all three of them take your mind.
[01:32:15.336 --> 01:32:18.536]   and take your focus and clarity and alertness to the next level.
[01:32:18.536 --> 01:32:23.534]  It is 40% off at infowarestore.com for a limited time.
[01:32:23.534 --> 01:32:25.136]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:32:25.136 --> 01:32:27.935]   If you haven't tried these products, you really need to because they are amazing.
[01:32:27.935 --> 01:32:33.735]   Infowarestore.com All right, let's race through your phone calls here ahead
[01:32:33.735 --> 01:32:40.336]   of Milo Yiannopoulos joining us in studio into the fourth hour today.
[01:32:40.336 --> 01:32:43.936]   I'm going to go in the order that your calls have been received here.
[01:32:44.039 --> 01:32:50.221]  The longest holding would be Jeff in Windsor, then Max in Montreal.
[01:32:50.841 --> 01:32:52.122]  Jeff in Windsor, Canada.
[01:32:52.222 --> 01:32:55.623]  What do you make of this historic situation we're witnessing?
[01:32:56.924 --> 01:32:59.364]  Well, first, Alex, I want to say God bless you.
[01:32:59.404 --> 01:33:02.706]  God bless InfoWars and God bless human freedom.
[01:33:03.646 --> 01:33:04.886]  We're praying for InfoWars.
[01:33:04.926 --> 01:33:06.667]  We're praying for the whole world right now.
[01:33:07.227 --> 01:33:09.368]  I'm a 15 year veteran InfoWarrior.
[01:33:10.667 --> 01:33:13.208]  I've got two really important points to make.
[01:33:13.608 --> 01:33:23.449]  First, the video you played earlier with the Liberal MP that equates Hong Kong to Heil Hitler, so the HH, Hong Kong, that's to answer your previous caller.
[01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:29.711]  Get the full clip, because right before she says that, she calls for complete gun confiscation.
[01:33:30.491 --> 01:33:36.472]  In May of 2020, Justin Trudeau and the RCMP pulled a huge false flag in Nova Scotia.
[01:33:37.099 --> 01:33:42.778]   and then had an executive order and banned 1500 types of firearms like AR-15.
[01:33:42.778 --> 01:33:47.179]   They call quote unquote a military assault style blah blah blah.
[01:33:47.179 --> 01:33:54.859]   They gave a two-year amnesty which is about to expire in May of 2022 and if it expires
[01:33:54.859 --> 01:33:59.338]   gun owners will have to turn in their firearms without compensation.
[01:33:59.503 --> 01:34:00.123]  I remember that.
[01:34:00.163 --> 01:34:04.006]  So they're bringing Canada, that's so rich, it's got as much resources as the U.S.
[01:34:04.086 --> 01:34:06.628]  or more, under world government martial law.
[01:34:06.668 --> 01:34:07.209]  It's incredible.
[01:34:08.349 --> 01:34:17.856]  So the Liberal government's been taking a lot of heat for the cost of this buyback, which they, there's some people say like four or five billion dollars to buy back all these guns because there's millions.
[01:34:17.957 --> 01:34:21.079]  Canada's a very large firearms owning population.
[01:34:21.419 --> 01:34:24.001]  And of course you saw what happened after they got the Aussie guns.
[01:34:24.982 --> 01:34:25.142]  Yeah.
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:45.429]  So, second, I want to go over the GiveSendGo hack, which I know that InfoWars has a GiveSendGo fundraising account that they have there, but supposedly it was hacked by some Froot Loop lefty in his mama's basement, which I think is completely bogus.
[01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:47.270]  I think it was a state actor.
[01:34:47.630 --> 01:34:51.392]  Canada's part of the Five Eyes, so I think this goes probably clear.
[01:34:51.412 --> 01:34:51.732]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:34:51.752 --> 01:34:54.214]  They use that Froot Loop guy as the front guy all the time, I was told.
[01:34:54.274 --> 01:34:54.934]  Absolutely, yeah.
[01:34:56.102 --> 01:35:01.144]  And then you notice the media then used all that against people, so they aided and abetted with the stolen material.
[01:35:01.184 --> 01:35:03.325]  That's the corporate media, enemy of the people.
[01:35:04.286 --> 01:35:06.907]  Not to steal your words, but it gets worse.
[01:35:07.387 --> 01:35:19.293]  Today they published a docs list, a map, a Google map, it's on Google, with all the people who donated, with their full name, their postal code, like the American zip code, and their IP addresses.
[01:35:19.453 --> 01:35:21.554]  Wow, who put out a targeting list of these people?
[01:35:22.274 --> 01:35:27.064]   Well it's posted, it says anonymous, It just says, convoy donors for Ontario.
[01:35:27.084 --> 01:35:27.885]  That's the one I have.
[01:35:28.005 --> 01:35:34.091]  Wow, so they want to send a message to everybody that if you stand up against permanent martial law and forced injection, we're going to come after you.
[01:35:34.111 --> 01:35:34.732]  Well, guess what?
[01:35:34.992 --> 01:35:36.313]  We know you're coming after us.
[01:35:36.353 --> 01:35:37.354]  We already figured it out.
[01:35:37.915 --> 01:35:39.136]  Amazing points, Jeff.
[01:35:39.256 --> 01:35:40.257]  We appreciate your call.
[01:35:40.778 --> 01:35:43.000]  I could talk to every caller for 10 hours, but we've got to get to everybody here.
[01:35:43.841 --> 01:35:45.622]  Let's go to Max in Montreal, Canada.
[01:35:45.642 --> 01:35:46.183]  Max, welcome.
[01:35:47.188 --> 01:35:50.049]  Hello, long-time listener, first-time caller.
[01:35:50.189 --> 01:35:50.490]  Yes, sir.
[01:35:50.710 --> 01:35:52.711]  And I love supporting InfoWars Store.
[01:35:53.051 --> 01:35:53.351]  Thank you.
[01:35:53.451 --> 01:35:55.632]  Really high-quality goods, DNA Force all the way.
[01:35:56.112 --> 01:35:58.413]  I bought the silver dollar, we said wars go all the way.
[01:35:58.933 --> 01:35:59.954]  So, support small business.
[01:35:59.974 --> 01:36:00.654]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:36:00.694 --> 01:36:04.696]  We would be shut down now if you hadn't bought that silver dollar, you know, for three, four times the markup.
[01:36:04.716 --> 01:36:05.156]  We did that.
[01:36:05.436 --> 01:36:06.917]  You need to fund us as a fundraiser.
[01:36:07.157 --> 01:36:08.037]  That's a piece of history.
[01:36:08.097 --> 01:36:09.058]  God bless you and thank you.
[01:36:10.017 --> 01:36:12.599]  Yeah, well, money is worthless at the moment.
[01:36:12.719 --> 01:36:12.940]  It is.
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:15.021]  Like, you see what they're doing in Canada at the moment?
[01:36:15.042 --> 01:36:17.644]  They're just basically moving us to a digital currency.
[01:36:18.224 --> 01:36:20.967]  Oh, I would give, I mean, I would give everything I've got to stop these people.
[01:36:21.007 --> 01:36:22.969]  I mean, because I know it's not going to stop.
[01:36:23.169 --> 01:36:24.310]  We've gone over the edge.
[01:36:25.130 --> 01:36:27.653]  Yeah, and the worst thing is I talk to my friends, like, every two weeks.
[01:36:27.813 --> 01:36:32.277]  I don't want to, like, create a separation, so I always have a line of communication.
[01:36:33.511 --> 01:36:35.013]  Their reasoning is out the window.
[01:36:35.273 --> 01:36:43.201]  And they're all Marxists and I show them how basically Marxism, big business, is like right, left, you know, David Icke, problem, reaction, solution, everything.
[01:36:43.281 --> 01:36:44.982]  And they don't care.
[01:36:45.343 --> 01:36:45.823]  They don't see.
[01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:49.207]  And I just want to go more deeply into the World Economic Forum.
[01:36:49.707 --> 01:36:50.408]  I'm in Quebec.
[01:36:50.768 --> 01:36:54.672]  Our Premier, the first thing he did when he was elected was go to Davos to speak there.
[01:36:55.327 --> 01:37:04.856]  He tweets, uh, I've read the Fourth Industrial Revolution, but then when we go to Parliament and we want to go argue with him, he says, oh, well, they're all conspiracy theorists who believe in Michael.
[01:37:04.876 --> 01:37:07.378]  Oh, I know, it's happened here in the U.S., Europe, and Canada.
[01:37:07.398 --> 01:37:12.342]  I've seen it where they go, hey, uh, there's letters that are public where Klaus Schwab's ordering you around.
[01:37:12.362 --> 01:37:13.723]  He goes, I don't even know who Klaus Schwab is.
[01:37:13.743 --> 01:37:19.849]  He goes, well, you, you're his guest of honor, and you, you, I mean, again, the way they lie to you is incredible, isn't it?
[01:37:20.706 --> 01:37:29.272]  Yeah, he puts it on Twitter, and then you show your uncle or your grandmother, hey look, you don't know how to read English, you barely, like, the only thing you do is watch the news and they think you're cuckoo.
[01:37:29.652 --> 01:37:32.854]  All of a sudden they ask you, hey, do you believe in climate change?
[01:37:32.894 --> 01:37:34.295]  Like, out of the blue, it makes no sense.
[01:37:34.495 --> 01:37:43.321]  But anyway, I work in AI, and I have to say, like, almost, like, not to discuss good or bad, but all of the applications are for track, trace, control.
[01:37:43.701 --> 01:37:45.042]  It's like, that's all they care about.
[01:37:45.515 --> 01:37:46.916]  Like, can we read your license plate?
[01:37:46.996 --> 01:37:48.656]  Can we count the amount of people in the crowd?
[01:37:48.676 --> 01:37:50.037]  Can we identify your faces?
[01:37:50.157 --> 01:37:51.317]  Can we read your license plate?
[01:37:51.918 --> 01:37:53.578]  Can we see you through your house?
[01:37:53.618 --> 01:37:57.380]  Can we see with a helicopter your license plate from 20 kilometers away?
[01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:59.280]  You know, that's all they talk about.
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:02.882]  And then I'm like, hey guys, you ever realize that they turned that against you?
[01:38:03.322 --> 01:38:04.402]  Like, come on, wake up!
[01:38:05.243 --> 01:38:08.064]  Well, they think they'll be part of the winning team, and they're the biggest fools of all.
[01:38:08.444 --> 01:38:09.404]  Beautiful points, Max.
[01:38:09.424 --> 01:38:10.305]  We love you up there.
[01:38:10.385 --> 01:38:10.765]  Thank you.
[01:38:11.687 --> 01:38:18.431]  Canadian stood up, folks, and they got crushed, and now many are going to solitary confinement with no trial or no bond.
[01:38:18.471 --> 01:38:21.912]  I mean, just unprecedented evil in North America.
[01:38:22.573 --> 01:38:24.294]  I mean, that is just wild.
[01:38:25.514 --> 01:38:27.715]  That is just wild, folks.
[01:38:28.736 --> 01:38:32.178]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike in Calgary, Canada.
[01:38:32.198 --> 01:38:32.658]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:38:34.284 --> 01:38:34.904]  Good day, Alex.
[01:38:34.924 --> 01:38:36.005]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:38:36.505 --> 01:38:37.525]  Thank you, InfoWarriors.
[01:38:37.565 --> 01:38:40.387]  I regret to inform you that this probably might be the last time we talk.
[01:38:40.667 --> 01:38:41.867]  It's good to talk to you again, Alex.
[01:38:41.947 --> 01:38:44.248]  It's good to talk to you, Ryan.
[01:38:44.588 --> 01:38:48.990]  There's quite a few elephants in the room, three of them, and then there's two more short ones after that.
[01:38:49.010 --> 01:38:59.535]  You know, what's crazy about this whole democracy thing is that we had people come to our parliament to address our grievances with them.
[01:39:00.129 --> 01:39:01.170]  And they weren't even listened to.
[01:39:01.190 --> 01:39:03.232]  They weren't even addressed by the Premier.
[01:39:03.632 --> 01:39:09.176]  So that tells you how much of an authoritative state we have lived at up until that point.
[01:39:09.497 --> 01:39:16.582]  Well, yeah, and you also have the Speaker of the Parliament blocking the member of Parliament that brings up Klaus Schwab alumni.
[01:39:16.622 --> 01:39:18.364]  And then it's just insane.
[01:39:18.904 --> 01:39:21.166]  This is North Korea come to North America.
[01:39:22.167 --> 01:39:22.907]  Oh, it is, brother.
[01:39:23.107 --> 01:39:23.868]  Second point.
[01:39:24.679 --> 01:39:26.900]  Trudeau's jab cut COVID twice.
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:29.380]  Doesn't that tell you that maybe the jabs don't work?
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:30.040]  Perhaps?
[01:39:31.141 --> 01:39:32.621]  Like, it's total garbage.
[01:39:33.241 --> 01:39:38.783]  They want everyone jabbed so there's no control group for this grand experiment that they're running globally.
[01:39:39.223 --> 01:39:40.723]  It is absolutely garbage.
[01:39:41.063 --> 01:39:42.744]  The media is totally behind it.
[01:39:43.424 --> 01:39:46.065]  I'll give you another example about how they're using division.
[01:39:46.105 --> 01:39:56.514]   Like, if you go on any comment in any Canadian website, The comments are like 90% negative against what the government has done in the last week.
[01:39:57.615 --> 01:40:07.201]  And the way they divide us is things when they had these all these unmarked graves all over D. It is total absolute garbage because they didn't exhume anything.
[01:40:07.641 --> 01:40:14.286]  The way they could find out if there's actually people in the ground there is they could do what's called a core sample and inspect it for DNA.
[01:40:15.507 --> 01:40:16.147]  Cave closed.
[01:40:16.247 --> 01:40:20.130]  There were three universities that had people lined up ready to go and the government blocked them.
[01:40:22.888 --> 01:40:24.068]  I'm deep in this, man.
[01:40:24.968 --> 01:40:27.549]  I have a friend, Pastor Archer Pawlowski.
[01:40:28.269 --> 01:40:36.651]  Oh, he's facing, for preaching, he's facing 10 years in prison under the Emergency Act and no bond as well.
[01:40:37.832 --> 01:40:45.814]  He has his cell phone in RCMP and CPS's possession right now with my number on it.
[01:40:46.614 --> 01:40:49.135]  I've been friends with Staff Sergeant Joe Big.
[01:40:49.949 --> 01:41:05.932]  Formerly of Infowars on Facebook and we collaborated trying to figure out what this coded messaging was in the October 31, 2016 WikiLeaks where there's Obama used $65,000 of the taxpayers' money on hot dogs.
[01:41:06.012 --> 01:41:07.032]  Pretty interesting.
[01:41:08.852 --> 01:41:18.074]  Last point I want to get, and your callers can take my name and information after this, but I'd like to start a petition for someone with Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[01:41:18.837 --> 01:41:22.236]  and see if she can get something going for political.
[01:41:22.236 --> 01:41:24.397]  Brother, God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[01:41:24.397 --> 01:41:25.877]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:41:25.877 --> 01:41:27.516]  Wow, we're gonna go to break.
[01:41:27.516 --> 01:41:30.756]   We're gonna get to five or six more callers when we come back.
[01:41:30.756 --> 01:41:36.196]   We're gonna go to Matt in Toronto, who's up first, then Jim in Ontario, Canada,
[01:41:36.196 --> 01:41:42.637]   then Lane, Chris, and others from Toronto, Canada, straight ahead.
[01:41:42.637 --> 01:41:47.637]   And then Milo Yiannopoulos was here in town the other day working on some journalistic stories.
[01:41:47.517 --> 01:41:50.118]  Went out to dinner, he and I, and MTG.
[01:41:50.158 --> 01:41:51.379]  It was really a lot of fun.
[01:41:51.819 --> 01:41:52.820]  He's got a lot to say.
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:53.820]  He's coming in for an hour.
[01:41:54.121 --> 01:41:56.202]  Then I got even more news to hit in the last 30 minutes.
[01:41:56.562 --> 01:41:57.903]  I'm hosting the fourth hour today.
[01:41:57.943 --> 01:42:02.205]  You're stuck with Alex Jones from InfoWars.com.
[01:42:02.846 --> 01:42:03.326]  Stay with us.
[01:42:04.047 --> 01:42:11.327]  Taking your phone calls here on this 2/2/2022 transmission.
[01:42:11.327 --> 01:42:15.326]   At the end of the fourth hour, we have a special report from Greg Reese that hasn't come out yet.
[01:42:15.374 --> 01:42:16.315]  We're going to be premiering here.
[01:42:17.195 --> 01:42:25.401]  And a very powerful thing that Joe Rogan's guest that he interviewed three weeks ago finally aired a few days ago had to say, and he just knocked it out of the park.
[01:42:26.982 --> 01:42:29.764]  So look for that towards the end of the next hour as well.
[01:42:29.784 --> 01:42:33.707]  Um, let's go to your phone calls back to the great phone calls here.
[01:42:33.727 --> 01:42:37.770]  Uh, let's talk to Jim in Canada, Jim in Ontario.
[01:42:37.810 --> 01:42:38.290]  Go ahead, Jim.
[01:42:39.924 --> 01:42:48.691]  Hi, I launched FreedomUnion.org last night at midnight, and it's basically a declaration of independence of digital slavery.
[01:42:48.711 --> 01:42:53.435]  Beautiful, say it again, because everything is independence against digital slavery.
[01:42:53.895 --> 01:42:58.699]  Everything in the future is going to be fighting the worldwide carbon tax social credit score.
[01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:03.523]  Absolutely, QR codes, QR cowboys coming around everybody up.
[01:43:04.747 --> 01:43:13.270]  I'm begging and pleading for hockey parents to hit the outdoor rinks and raise their hockey sticks with Canadian flags, have signs.
[01:43:13.770 --> 01:43:17.432]  I love what Theo Fleury's doing, a proud Canadian.
[01:43:17.872 --> 01:43:18.852]  He's fighting the fight.
[01:43:19.572 --> 01:43:21.473]  So, it's getting unreal.
[01:43:21.773 --> 01:43:24.974]  Man, it's crazy that the New World Order chose you for maximum tyranny.
[01:43:24.994 --> 01:43:31.456]  Yeah, a friend of mine in Ottawa had his car impounded for eight days without due process.
[01:43:31.596 --> 01:43:33.037]  It's completely insane.
[01:43:35.123 --> 01:43:40.667]  What do you make of him grabbing the peaceful organizers and saying no bond to be up to a year till trial, ten years in prison?
[01:43:41.128 --> 01:43:46.212]  I mean, meanwhile, peaceful protests burn down buildings and they get awards for it and Trudeau endorsed Black Lives Matter.
[01:43:47.393 --> 01:44:01.259]   Yeah, like, what I can't understand is how are just two of the people who were in front of the camera talking out of the committee, there was like five to ten people at every given Like, where are the other people?
[01:44:01.319 --> 01:44:02.739]  Why are they not in jail?
[01:44:02.859 --> 01:44:07.641]  You know, it's like, how can they just selectively pick people that aren't agreeing with the narrative?
[01:44:07.661 --> 01:44:09.822]  That's what authoritarians do, brother.
[01:44:09.922 --> 01:44:11.082]  Jim, thank you so much.
[01:44:11.142 --> 01:44:11.782]  Thanks for holding.
[01:44:11.822 --> 01:44:12.603]  Wow, great callers.
[01:44:13.083 --> 01:44:15.024]  Let's go to Matt in Toronto, Canada.
[01:44:15.044 --> 01:44:15.744]  Matt, thanks for holding.
[01:44:17.236 --> 01:44:18.657]  Hey Alex, great to talk to you.
[01:44:19.558 --> 01:44:29.607]  Listen, I love all the callers that just called, all the Canadians, but why aren't they saying... The person that comes out of their mouth should be an SOS, because we don't have a parliament no more.
[01:44:29.647 --> 01:44:30.708]  We have a dictatorship.
[01:44:31.168 --> 01:44:35.192]  And remember, Hitler got in and the parliament declared him dictator later.
[01:44:35.512 --> 01:44:39.512]  routinely, most of the time, dictatorships are elected.
[01:44:39.512 --> 01:44:40.512]  That's what people need to get.
[01:44:40.512 --> 01:44:45.512]   He's declaring a dictatorship and saying no bond for peaceful protesters.
[01:44:45.512 --> 01:44:48.512]  Folks, that's North Korea level.
[01:44:48.512 --> 01:44:51.512]  It's absolutely insane, Alex.
[01:44:51.512 --> 01:44:55.512]  We should be making SOS Canada shirts.
[01:44:55.568 --> 01:44:57.309]  I'd rather see... No, I agree.
[01:44:57.349 --> 01:44:59.870]  Canadians should all be doing videos on every platform they can.
[01:45:00.250 --> 01:45:05.991]  You know, from Getter, uh, to, to Gab, uh, to, uh, you know, Trump's thing once it's working.
[01:45:06.812 --> 01:45:07.232]  Hopefully.
[01:45:07.692 --> 01:45:09.412]  And, and, but also on all the enemy channels.
[01:45:09.873 --> 01:45:11.853]  And just saying, SOS, help us, SOS.
[01:45:11.873 --> 01:45:12.854]  This is like North Korea.
[01:45:13.434 --> 01:45:15.975]  And the left will all make jokes and stuff, but people know the truth.
[01:45:16.255 --> 01:45:20.256]  We need to see all Canadians get online now and say, help us.
[01:45:21.115 --> 01:45:21.875]  Help us, man.
[01:45:21.915 --> 01:45:22.736]  We're screwed.
[01:45:22.816 --> 01:45:26.697]  It's gonna be days, weeks, soon, like a month.
[01:45:26.937 --> 01:45:28.518]  I can feel it in my bones, man.
[01:45:28.858 --> 01:45:34.360]  Our friends... Oh yeah, they're getting ready to stage a mass shooting or bombing and they're gonna start arresting everybody.
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:36.481]  I mean, Trudeau is a psychotic.
[01:45:37.121 --> 01:45:39.262]  He is Klaus Schwab's favorite leader.
[01:45:39.502 --> 01:45:45.744]  Klaus Schwab says, he is the example of the new world and what we're about to do.
[01:45:46.846 --> 01:45:47.347]  Absolutely.
[01:45:47.567 --> 01:45:53.316]  What's going to happen when us Canadians, when we call our family and they're not there no more because they tested positive for COVID and went to the hospital?
[01:45:53.336 --> 01:45:55.800]  Oh yeah, they went to a camp and oh, they died in the camp.
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:56.221]  That's right.
[01:45:56.281 --> 01:45:57.222]  Death by ventilator.
[01:45:57.903 --> 01:45:58.725]  Beautiful point, Matt.
[01:45:58.765 --> 01:45:59.165]  We love you.
[01:45:59.185 --> 01:46:00.507]  Trying to get to everybody right now.
[01:46:02.383 --> 01:46:16.650]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Ottawa, the center of the Globalist Takeover, where the governor has gone along with it, the premier, where the leaders have gone along with all of it, and now the mayor says, we're taking all your property, taking your cars.
[01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:18.471]  He is a Klaus Schwab acolyte.
[01:46:18.911 --> 01:46:25.094]  The head judge there says, no free speech, 10 years in prison for any peaceful protest against the lockdowns.
[01:46:25.134 --> 01:46:26.415]  Truro is God Emperor.
[01:46:26.795 --> 01:46:28.276]  You are literally living in North Korea.
[01:46:29.116 --> 01:46:30.817]  The world has got to wake up and say no to this.
[01:46:32.506 --> 01:46:33.907]  Chris, in Ottawa, what's your view on this?
[01:46:35.228 --> 01:46:53.038]  Well, it's funny you mention that, Alex, because I was actually a live streamer, boots on the ground, in Ottawa, live streaming all of this, and having a first-person perspective, so I just figured, yeah, I'd call in, and if you have any questions for me, you're supposed to... Well, sir, you're here, you've got the floor, just what do you want to telegraph, your nugget of information?
[01:46:54.639 --> 01:47:10.649]   Well, I'm Red Prince on YouTube, if anyone wants to see the truth, it's there, but if I want to say one thing, Is that all the media are lying about everything in terms of stealing from the homeless, uh, graffiti, vandalism, everything, all of the above.
[01:47:10.729 --> 01:47:12.810]  It was honestly exactly the opposite.
[01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:15.832]  I didn't even see a single cigarette butt on the ground.
[01:47:15.872 --> 01:47:16.572]  It was that clean.
[01:47:17.292 --> 01:47:19.173]  Well, I noticed that in the videos, but it didn't matter.
[01:47:19.213 --> 01:47:24.055]  Trudeau said there were Nazis and you stole food and you, you desecrated war memorials.
[01:47:24.075 --> 01:47:28.037]  Of course, none of it was true because he's a criminal dictator, liar, taking your country down.
[01:47:29.366 --> 01:47:39.112]  Oh, exactly, and I was actually there in the last stand, and I don't know if you saw it, but there was a horse that trampled a native woman, and that's kind of ironic.
[01:47:39.332 --> 01:47:39.852]  No, I saw it.
[01:47:39.912 --> 01:47:42.313]  I mean, they jammed the cell phones the last day.
[01:47:42.353 --> 01:47:43.094]  We didn't see a lot of that.
[01:47:43.414 --> 01:47:44.194]  How did it all end?
[01:47:44.214 --> 01:47:46.276]  How did it all end?
[01:47:46.336 --> 01:48:08.860]   Well, I barely got away without being arrested, but they deployed LRAD, which is basically a sonic boom that inactivates all electronic devices and And I'm seeing that they're not going to give a lot of them bonds.
[01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:12.143]  So the message is, you protest peacefully, this is North Korea, you disappear.
[01:48:12.163 --> 01:48:16.668]  Everybody knows, if you're a tourist in North Korea, don't protest, don't speak out, you disappear.
[01:48:16.968 --> 01:48:18.910]  And literally, Canada has fallen.
[01:48:20.856 --> 01:48:34.964]  I'm honestly so afraid for my financial security and safety and, you know, for my future family because I've heard about them freezing bank accounts, knocking on your door and potentially arresting you if you resist.
[01:48:35.065 --> 01:48:37.806]  And of course, once you get into the fear, then they totally win.
[01:48:37.866 --> 01:48:39.167]  That's why we've got to say no.
[01:48:39.187 --> 01:48:40.848]  I mean, how do we stand with Canada?
[01:48:40.908 --> 01:48:41.708]  How do we say no?
[01:48:42.069 --> 01:48:43.069]  How do we have solidarity?
[01:48:43.109 --> 01:48:46.031]  How do we stop this incredibly wicked operation?
[01:48:47.555 --> 01:48:49.116]  I have no idea at this point.
[01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:52.098]  I don't even know how many people are left after that convoy.
[01:48:52.459 --> 01:48:59.124]  I gotta say that most of the truckers leave and they ran once they saw the line of riot police.
[01:48:59.624 --> 01:49:03.447]  I don't even know how many truckers would be willing to do this again if there was the opportunity.
[01:49:03.567 --> 01:49:04.668]  Well, I think that's good.
[01:49:04.748 --> 01:49:07.630]  How dare those Canadians think they can go peacefully protest.
[01:49:07.690 --> 01:49:11.874]  If they wanted to burn buildings, burn down police stations and worship communism, they'd have been hailed.
[01:49:12.234 --> 01:49:14.596]  Hell, Vice President Kamala Harris would bail them out of jail.
[01:49:14.656 --> 01:49:23.023]  But, peacefully saying no to forced lockdowns and forced injections and massing of children, you shut your dirty Canadian mouths, you monsters.
[01:49:24.764 --> 01:49:25.365]  Thank you, Chris.
[01:49:25.465 --> 01:49:31.050]  Alright, we're going to get to Lane and Irfan in Toronto.
[01:49:31.090 --> 01:49:32.391]  Those are the last callers of the day.
[01:49:33.499 --> 01:49:36.260]  Milo Yiannopoulos is coming up and I'm going to get to you next segment.
[01:49:36.941 --> 01:49:42.583]  And then we're going to segue into Russia and the left and transgenderism and just going after the kids and all of it.
[01:49:43.564 --> 01:49:51.167]  And then this is really a big deal because I don't get into esoteric stuff and mumbo jumbo, but the globalists are really, really obsessed with it.
[01:49:51.848 --> 01:49:59.151]  And we've got a big event taking place astrologically today that is huge.
[01:50:00.091 --> 01:50:01.192]  And so we're going to be getting to that.
[01:50:01.252 --> 01:50:03.133]  And that Gregory's report, I think should be out by now.
[01:50:03.906 --> 01:50:05.347]  Let me know when the Gregory's Report is out, guys.
[01:50:05.367 --> 01:50:06.707]  We'll get it posted to Bandai Video.
[01:50:07.388 --> 01:50:11.349]  And I'm going to be premiering that, because hell, if it gets done early, I'll play it before Bionicle leaves us.
[01:50:11.829 --> 01:50:15.651]  Because this is a big deal, and you can't ignore that the globalists believe in this stuff.
[01:50:15.671 --> 01:50:16.411]  I'm going to be following it.
[01:50:16.972 --> 01:50:18.792]  Separately, thank you all for your word of mouth.
[01:50:18.872 --> 01:50:21.634]  Now you see free speech is under more attack than ever.
[01:50:22.014 --> 01:50:25.115]  When I tell you stuff's coming down to the wire, I'm not doing that just to say it.
[01:50:25.555 --> 01:50:29.577]  I mean, I'm staying at my post, folks, but let me tell you, the water's rising fast, okay?
[01:50:30.077 --> 01:50:37.334]   Ship's going down, and It's so sad, but we've become a satanic population.
[01:50:37.394 --> 01:50:38.034]  That's what happens.
[01:50:38.575 --> 01:50:39.495]  So we're going to get judged.
[01:50:39.575 --> 01:50:42.998]  But those of us that get back with God and get righter, I think you're going to be protected.
[01:50:43.498 --> 01:50:45.539]  We got to pray for the political prisoners of Canada, though.
[01:50:45.859 --> 01:50:46.380]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:46.800]  Stay with us.
[01:50:47.841 --> 01:50:49.422]  And Greg Reese has filed a report.
[01:50:49.482 --> 01:50:53.685]  You may not believe in all this stuff, but ladies and gentlemen, the globalists do.
[01:50:54.025 --> 01:50:56.987]  And historically, when this happens, all hell breaks loose.
[01:50:57.007 --> 01:50:58.588]  The report just went live.
[01:50:59.252 --> 01:51:06.252]   at Bandot Video, Pluto's return and the rebirth of individual freedom.
[01:51:06.252 --> 01:51:19.172]  Thanks for watching.
[01:51:19.111 --> 01:51:25.733]  And although today's pop culture paints it as pseudoscience, occult traditions see it as sacred knowledge.
[01:51:26.754 --> 01:51:33.117]  While it is a great mystery, it is as predictable as mathematics and experiential for everyone.
[01:51:34.145 --> 01:51:42.191]  And today, astrologically speaking, is a very interesting day for America and individual freedom worldwide.
[01:51:42.011 --> 01:51:54.011]   Today is 2/22/2022, the first time Pluto is conjunct to the United States since July 4th, 1776.
[01:51:54.011 --> 01:52:00.011]  A 248 year event known as Pluto's return.
[01:52:00.252 --> 01:52:07.559]  Every time a planet returns to the same degree it was in relation to your location of birth, you experience a return.
[01:52:08.539 --> 01:52:12.063]  Many of us can personally understand the idea of Saturn's return.
[01:52:12.763 --> 01:52:20.665]  It takes Saturn about 29 years to orbit the Sun, and so it happens roughly around your 29th birthday.
[01:52:21.165 --> 01:52:32.028]  Because Saturn symbolizes severity and discipline, this time is known as an era of learning through harsh reality for those who haven't already mastered self-discipline.
[01:52:32.988 --> 01:52:43.535]  Pluto symbolizes destruction and rebirth, and so Pluto's return, which lasts about two years, is considered to be a time of destruction and rebirth.
[01:52:44.335 --> 01:52:58.684]  During the Roman Empire's first Pluto's return, the Severan dynasty collapsed, a time known as the Crisis of the Third Century, and their second Pluto return took place ten years before the end of the Roman Empire.
[01:52:59.785 --> 01:53:03.107]  And now, America's first Pluto's return on 2-22-2022.
[01:53:02.927 --> 01:53:06.806]  on 2/22/2022.
[01:53:06.806 --> 01:53:11.807]  Two times two times two times 222 equals 1776.
[01:53:11.807 --> 01:53:19.367]  It begins on a Tuesday and it lasts two years.
[01:53:19.874 --> 01:53:28.496]  Perhaps you dismiss all this as pseudoscience woo-woo, but it is important to know that the occultists who sway the governments of the world do not.
[01:53:28.976 --> 01:53:35.398]  They take this sort of thing very seriously, which could explain why they all seem to be in such a frantic hurry.
[01:53:36.038 --> 01:53:38.739]  More than America, July 4th, 1776 symbolizes individual freedom.
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:53.354]  And so, astrologically speaking, the next two years will mark either the destruction or rebirth of these individual freedoms that were born in 1776.
[01:53:55.235 --> 01:53:58.235]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reis.
[01:53:58.235 --> 01:54:13.235]  [Music]
[01:54:13.235 --> 01:54:16.235]   Now whether you believe in that or not, the globalists are obsessed with it.
[01:54:16.671 --> 01:54:22.162]  You notice Putin invaded part of Ukraine on the eve of that.
[01:54:22.242 --> 01:54:24.566]  I mean, he didn't even get into it in the report.
[01:54:24.586 --> 01:54:25.768]  The Roman Empire fell.
[01:54:27.395 --> 01:54:30.276]  Was sacked and finally completely fell on the Pluto's return?
[01:54:30.736 --> 01:54:32.257]  I mean, this is some wild stuff.
[01:54:33.057 --> 01:54:36.438]  And, uh... Man, all hell is breaking loose.
[01:54:36.598 --> 01:54:39.259]  Joining us for the rest of the transmission is Milo Yiannopoulos.
[01:54:39.819 --> 01:54:42.240]  It was really great to see him here in town doing some journalistic work.
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:44.461]  We had dinner with MTG on Sunday night.
[01:54:44.501 --> 01:54:46.562]  He's here for a few more days doing work.
[01:54:46.622 --> 01:54:47.722]  Hopefully he'll be on the other shows.
[01:54:48.422 --> 01:54:49.323]  But he is, uh...
[01:54:50.283 --> 01:54:52.244]  A columnist, and now he's a church militant.
[01:54:52.284 --> 01:54:57.207]  He's been knocked off his horse like Saul on the road to Damascus.
[01:54:57.247 --> 01:54:58.468]  He's now Paul, I guess.
[01:54:59.048 --> 01:55:03.491]  And he's on Gab at M and Telegram at Milo Official.
[01:55:04.152 --> 01:55:05.032]  And he's here with us.
[01:55:05.052 --> 01:55:06.773]  So, Milo, so much to talk about.
[01:55:07.293 --> 01:55:08.314]  So much going on.
[01:55:08.334 --> 01:55:12.677]  I mean, Russia, the COVID thing collapsing, martial law in Canada.
[01:55:13.477 --> 01:55:15.620]  It's just, where the hell do we begin?
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:19.384]  This is absolutely crazy, the moment we've gotten to.
[01:55:19.424 --> 01:55:20.545]  First, it's great to see you here.
[01:55:21.225 --> 01:55:22.667]  What would you call this period of time, Warren?
[01:55:22.687 --> 01:55:23.188]  Good to see you, buddy.
[01:55:23.208 --> 01:55:23.988]  Thanks, man.
[01:55:24.008 --> 01:55:24.829]  Good to see you again, Alex.
[01:55:25.450 --> 01:55:27.913]  I mean, more than anything, I'd call it frightening.
[01:55:28.615 --> 01:55:35.363]  I mean, those of us who have been, um, we've been fighting, we've been, uh, um, you know, totally unafraid of everything for a really long time.
[01:55:35.403 --> 01:55:37.705]  We've been saying, ha ha ha, censorship only makes me stronger.
[01:55:37.946 --> 01:55:38.727]  We've been doing all this stuff.
[01:55:39.187 --> 01:55:43.572]  I gotta tell you, over the last 18 months, I've started to get a little bit frightened, and I don't mind admitting it.
[01:55:43.632 --> 01:55:44.854]  I don't mind telling people.
[01:55:45.254 --> 01:55:48.558]  I've started to get a little bit spooked when you look at... Well, you should be!
[01:55:48.678 --> 01:55:49.038]  I am too!
[01:55:49.959 --> 01:55:53.242]  I mean, how many friends do we have that are behind bars for peacefully protesting right now?
[01:55:53.302 --> 01:55:53.642]  Quite a few.
[01:55:54.023 --> 01:55:56.745]  I mean, almost everybody I know was at January 6th.
[01:55:56.765 --> 01:55:58.687]  I mean, I wasn't there, but almost everybody I know.
[01:55:58.727 --> 01:55:59.828]  My whole phone book was there.
[01:56:00.268 --> 01:56:06.433]  And they're all staring down the barrel of these astonishing, punitive, dishonest, horrendous prosecutions.
[01:56:06.753 --> 01:56:11.737]  And you know that when you get into federal court, there's a 97% conviction rate in federal court.
[01:56:12.718 --> 01:56:14.620]  If they bring charges against you, you're going down.
[01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:15.640]  You're going to jail.
[01:56:15.681 --> 01:56:17.062]  The only question is, for how long?
[01:56:17.362 --> 01:56:23.286]  Then you see this, like, just brazen, unashamed cutting off of bank accounts.
[01:56:23.306 --> 01:56:26.889]  The kind of stuff that we always talk about and we know is coming, but it's still shocking when it arrives.
[01:56:27.309 --> 01:56:32.313]  When you hear Trudeau's, you know, little whoever she is, saying, oh yeah, we're going to just close the bank accounts.
[01:56:32.593 --> 01:56:38.878]  And then you see the police harassing coffee shop owners for the crime of serving coffee to the truckers.
[01:56:39.319 --> 01:56:40.860]  Like, this stuff is wacky.
[01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:45.222]  By the way, I mean, I can't even play all this, and I'm not trying to just discredit police.
[01:56:45.582 --> 01:56:48.003]  Some of the globalists want to discredit police and they bring in their own police.
[01:56:48.283 --> 01:56:57.208]  But these were special bad police they brought in, beating up shopkeepers at major restaurants and delis that let people in and serve them food.
[01:56:57.488 --> 01:57:01.890]  And you saw in France them firing tear gas into cafes.
[01:57:02.250 --> 01:57:03.411]  I mean, this is terrorism.
[01:57:03.951 --> 01:57:11.976]  And there are these group chats leaking, that I'm sure you've seen as well, of police gloating about horses trampling truckers.
[01:57:11.996 --> 01:57:12.717]  I meant to get to that.
[01:57:12.737 --> 01:57:13.417]  Tell people about that.
[01:57:13.437 --> 01:57:14.078]  I haven't covered that.
[01:57:14.178 --> 01:57:22.923]  So there's a, they just leaked a WhatsApp group of the Canadian, it's the Mounted Police Division, although they look like the militarized cops that you used to see.
[01:57:22.943 --> 01:57:24.104]  Looks like Darth Vader's landing.
[01:57:24.284 --> 01:57:25.564]  Yeah, they do, they do.
[01:57:25.624 --> 01:57:28.825]  I know you call this place the Death Star, but they really are the evil empire.
[01:57:29.605 --> 01:57:34.547]  You know, the extraordinary militarization, and they're gloating.
[01:57:35.027 --> 01:57:37.207]  Childish gloating behind the scenes.
[01:57:37.567 --> 01:57:41.108]  Gloating about the fact that their horses are trampling people underfoot.
[01:57:41.448 --> 01:57:47.450]  And you see in these private WhatsApp groups that one of these police guys, obviously somebody in there has a soul, somebody in there has a conscience.
[01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:50.491]  Their conscience has been pricked and they've leaked this WhatsApp group.
[01:57:50.511 --> 01:57:51.171]  Yeah, that's the good news.
[01:57:51.371 --> 01:57:56.850]   Canadian, we have one good policeman in 50, they're leaking these Canadian police chats
[01:57:56.850 --> 01:58:01.730]   where the police officers are saying we need to learn that manoeuvre for when we're on
[01:58:01.730 --> 01:58:04.850]  horseback and cheering on the trampling of pedestrians.
[01:58:04.850 --> 01:58:07.210]  Nothing like running over an old lady on a mobility scooter.
[01:58:07.210 --> 01:58:12.190]   And this is in the context of the, just think about the vindictiveness, the petty vindictiveness
[01:58:13.005 --> 01:58:18.392]  This is in the context of Canadian governments saying, we're going to take your pets.
[01:58:18.853 --> 01:58:23.480]  If you're a trucker and you're not looking after your dog properly, we're going to take and destroy your dog.
[01:58:24.380 --> 01:58:35.865]  There was a tweet out from Ottawa police saying if you're not looking after your dogs properly they will be taken and if they're not claimed after eight days they'll be dealt with or some some other sinister Soviet style thing.
[01:58:37.265 --> 01:58:47.630]  Then they said about kids there was another I think it was again an Ottawa police tweet I think they said we're aware that there are children in the trucker convoy those children will be removed to a safe place.
[01:58:47.850 --> 01:58:48.810]   First Hmm.
[01:58:49.090 --> 01:58:50.812]  Do you think they're going to a safe place?
[01:58:50.972 --> 01:58:51.352]  I don't know.
[01:58:51.452 --> 01:58:55.575]  I think these are child... No, they use terrorism against... This is child snatching.
[01:58:55.735 --> 01:58:56.896]  It's child snatching.
[01:58:57.396 --> 01:59:04.121]  And this is, this is... And now they're holding the leaders facing 10 years in prison, no bail, up to a year till trial.
[01:59:04.421 --> 01:59:05.642]  I mean, that's North Korea.
[01:59:05.702 --> 01:59:07.123]  That, that is next level.
[01:59:07.603 --> 01:59:09.385]  This is Canada's January 6th.
[01:59:09.485 --> 01:59:15.330]  Another example of peaceful, non-destructive, non-violent protesters.
[01:59:15.370 --> 01:59:16.811]  I mean, there was a bit of a scuffle at the Capitol.
[01:59:16.831 --> 01:59:18.292]  I'm sure there have been a bit of scuffles and truckers.
[01:59:18.312 --> 01:59:19.533]  But compare that to the riots of 2020.
[01:59:20.114 --> 01:59:21.235]  Give me a break.
[01:59:21.795 --> 01:59:28.961]   These are for the vastly Peaceful, quiet, patriots standing up for the constitutions of their own countries.
[01:59:29.001 --> 01:59:30.902]  It's not even in some sense, it's even a political fight.
[01:59:31.162 --> 01:59:35.786]  They're just saying, can we please be the country that it says on that document, you know, that it was found, that we were, that we were founded.
[01:59:35.846 --> 01:59:38.968]  And who else says, yeah, these rights are guaranteed and we're not going to follow them.
[01:59:41.029 --> 01:59:41.409]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:59:41.429 --> 01:59:43.110]  Have you seen him say, I want to be a dictator?
[01:59:43.671 --> 01:59:50.215]  Oh, well, he has asked now, he's asked the Canadian Parliament to extend his emergency powers indefinitely.
[01:59:50.575 --> 01:59:52.516]  And he said to... We knew that was coming.
[01:59:52.656 --> 01:59:58.580]  And he said to the MPs, to the Supreme Council of Congressmen, in Canada, if you don't do it, you hate the Canadian government.
[01:59:58.880 --> 01:59:59.140]  Whoa.
[01:59:59.400 --> 01:59:59.960]  That's a quote.
[01:59:59.980 --> 02:00:00.921]  We have all these videos.
[02:00:00.941 --> 02:00:04.403]  We're going to talk to Lane in British Columbia as the last caller when we come back.
[02:00:04.783 --> 02:00:08.626]  I know about the New World Order, the whole plan, but man, it's one thing to know it's coming.
[02:00:09.686 --> 02:00:11.387]  It's nothing to get knocked upside the head by.
[02:00:11.407 --> 02:00:31.081]   It's kind of like you're going through a green light, you notice somebody's running a red light, and it seems like it's a minute before they hit you, but it's really just two seconds, you go, this is gonna hurt, and then next your jaw's broken, and you know, your teeth are knocked out, or your shoulder's broken, and one car wreck I was in, I had my shoulder I mean, we're in the car wreck right now.
[02:00:31.122 --> 02:00:32.962]  We've been hit by it.
[02:00:33.022 --> 02:00:36.463]  And we're going to go to Lane, who's been holding for a long time.
[02:00:36.523 --> 02:00:38.803]  Last caller we're going to get to from Canada here in a moment.
[02:00:39.524 --> 02:00:48.166]  But then you want to do just elaborate on a lot of different issues with Russia and the economy and political correctness and just where you see the world going.
[02:00:48.206 --> 02:00:49.486]  Milo Yiannopoulos is with us.
[02:00:49.846 --> 02:00:59.029]   You can follow him on Gab at M, just the letter M and telegram Milo officials and a lot of Super secret squirrel stuff behind the scenes.
[02:00:59.049 --> 02:01:04.634]  He claims he's he claims he is He claims he's retired, but that's so I'm gonna out him now.
[02:01:04.674 --> 02:01:05.234]  No, I'm joking.
[02:01:05.514 --> 02:01:13.399]   He's totally retired now and You must have been listening because I've only called this
[02:01:13.399 --> 02:01:18.550]   place the Death Star a few times and my point is it destroys globalists and they're
[02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:22.009]   always trying to shut us down and they think they take this down.
[02:01:22.009 --> 02:01:26.470]   They don't know there's two more Death Stars hidden behind the planet or maybe three Death
[02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:27.470]  Stars.
[02:01:27.470 --> 02:01:28.710]  No more is getting built right now.
[02:01:28.710 --> 02:01:32.429]   So when I figured out they want to shut me down, let's just say they'll never shut us
[02:01:32.429 --> 02:01:35.628]   down without turning the power off and put me in prison, which they're like, "Okay, we'll
[02:01:35.628 --> 02:01:36.869]  do that."
[02:01:36.909 --> 02:01:38.130]  So that's that's where we are.
[02:01:38.170 --> 02:01:40.873]  But it's funny, you know, the Death Star is Pluto.
[02:01:41.473 --> 02:01:42.394]  And I'm not a big.
[02:01:43.695 --> 02:01:48.699]  You know, person that's into esoteric, I'm not a big Gnostic, I'm not a big Rosicrucian, I'm not a big.
[02:01:50.467 --> 02:01:51.929]  Well, what's the term they use, Milo?
[02:01:51.949 --> 02:01:54.691]  The term I guess they use would be a numerologist.
[02:01:54.751 --> 02:01:57.394]  I'm not into numerology, but I know the globalist are.
[02:01:57.855 --> 02:02:14.504]   So you can't deny that Pluto under the Roman system and the Greek system is the Death Star, and it symbolizes destruction and rebirth, and that the last time it orbited through was Tuesday, 2-22-2022.
[02:02:15.324 --> 02:02:20.426]  2 plus 2 or 2 times 2 times 2 times 2-2-2 is 1776.
[02:02:20.746 --> 02:02:25.828]  2-2-2-2-2 is the first time Pluto has conjunct the United States since July 4, 1776.
[02:02:27.529 --> 02:02:30.790]  A 248-year event known as Pluto's Return.
[02:02:31.170 --> 02:02:34.072]  Pluto symbolizes the destruction and rebirth that begins today and lasts two years.
[02:02:34.652 --> 02:02:37.013]  It's really kind of crazy that this is all going on.
[02:02:37.873 --> 02:02:39.494]  And I'm not saying it's even real.
[02:02:39.614 --> 02:02:41.034]  I'm saying the globalists believe in this.
[02:02:41.315 --> 02:02:42.015]  What do you make of this?
[02:02:42.622 --> 02:02:55.284]  Well, perhaps it's not so much that the position of celestial bodies exerts an influence on our planet, but rather that because these people believe in those superstitions, they line up their machinations to match, right?
[02:02:55.324 --> 02:02:55.704]  Exactly.
[02:02:55.724 --> 02:02:56.784]  So they know it's coming.
[02:02:57.104 --> 02:03:04.606]  They know it's supposedly a thing for whatever, you know, child blood pagan sacrifice thing they do on a Sunday when the rest of us are in church.
[02:03:05.286 --> 02:03:06.426]  They know it's a thing for them.
[02:03:06.786 --> 02:03:11.467]  And so they line it up to match because these are great, you know, these are great events in there.
[02:03:12.388 --> 02:03:13.609]  Ecclesiology or whatever.
[02:03:15.450 --> 02:03:41.033]   I think a lot of people sniggered and sneered over the last five or ten years when they heard right-wing commentators talk about, you know, the pedophile stuff, the child sacrifice and all the rest of it, but they're not sneering now because ever more obviously and ever more ostentatiously the people who rule over us are kind of showing their hand, revealing that there is some kind of occult dimension To a lot of what goes on in politics and a lot of what goes on in Hollywood.
[02:03:41.293 --> 02:03:42.154]  It's there.
[02:03:42.374 --> 02:03:43.115]  And you can deny it.
[02:03:43.155 --> 02:03:44.417]  You deny it at your peril.
[02:03:44.777 --> 02:03:47.700]  There is something weird about these sex cults.
[02:03:47.741 --> 02:03:50.504]  The NXIVM or whatever the abbreviation was.
[02:03:50.544 --> 02:03:52.366]  You know, they're all at it.
[02:03:52.486 --> 02:03:53.106]  We're not quite sure.
[02:03:53.126 --> 02:03:54.647]  Or Jeffrey Epstein, or all of them?
[02:03:54.908 --> 02:03:57.910]  We're not exactly sure what it is they're up to, but they're up to something.
[02:03:58.170 --> 02:04:04.814]  And when they're doing obscene and appalling things to children, they're doing it in peculiar temples on billionaire's islands.
[02:04:05.114 --> 02:04:08.917]  Or they're doing it in private mansions you can't get into in the Hollywood Hills.
[02:04:08.957 --> 02:04:10.558]  This stuff is real, and it happens.
[02:04:10.818 --> 02:04:18.363]  And we don't know anything really about it, other than the occasional whispers from people who were on the periphery of that movement, who kind of blab, and then disappear.
[02:04:18.743 --> 02:04:24.465]   Or maybe, you know, something like I've got a Corey is it Corey what's his name Feldman Corey
[02:04:24.465 --> 02:04:25.005]  Feldman?
[02:04:25.005 --> 02:04:28.184]   That's right. Who's you know obviously very troubled and obviously has a lot of
[02:04:28.184 --> 02:04:34.003]   You know stuff going on, but the guy's seen things and you can tell when you look into his eyes you can tell
[02:04:34.003 --> 02:04:40.184]   something really awful happened, and and you know I was I only ever saw the very very like
[02:04:40.184 --> 02:04:44.125]   periphery of this when I was still a practicing homosexual and
[02:04:44.125 --> 02:04:48.925]   In Hollywood, and you know the pool parties and stuff like that, and I never witnessed anybody underage
[02:04:48.925 --> 02:04:54.104]   I never saw with my own eyes anything happened to children But there was a lot of older men and younger men and that
[02:04:54.104 --> 02:05:06.724]   kind of thing, but I never saw [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:04:57.862 --> 02:05:12.302]  With my own eyes, what is now becoming obvious to all of us, which is that there is an occultist, numerological, weird, some people would call it satanic, I probably would, call it a satanic dimension to a lot of the worst stuff that's happening in Hollywood and in the entertainment industry.
[02:05:12.322 --> 02:05:15.126]  It's no longer possible really plausibly to deny that, is it?
[02:05:16.297 --> 02:05:16.838]  No, it's not.
[02:05:16.858 --> 02:05:19.982]  I want to go to Lane in British Columbia and get her appointed.
[02:05:20.002 --> 02:05:20.803]  I appreciate her holding it.
[02:05:21.124 --> 02:05:22.165]  Or maybe Lane's a man.
[02:05:22.185 --> 02:05:24.028]  I guess that's a name for me either way.
[02:05:24.468 --> 02:05:27.713]  Like Alex could be Alexis, so I apologize if you're a man.
[02:05:27.753 --> 02:05:28.975]  Lane's usually a man.
[02:05:29.015 --> 02:05:30.317]  I apologize if he probably is a man.
[02:05:30.757 --> 02:05:35.225]   But I want to talk about Because I never judged you for being homosexual.
[02:05:35.886 --> 02:05:38.329]  I judge people off of what they actually do and how they live.
[02:05:38.349 --> 02:05:50.243]  But I do notice that that lifestyle is kind of run to the left and has become destructive and historically is connected to societal collapse when just the general public gets into that and the family.
[02:05:50.703 --> 02:05:57.382]   is destroyed, I want to ask what your epiphany was, or was it a process?
[02:05:57.382 --> 02:06:02.103]   Because they say somebody can't go from being gay to being heterosexual or vice versa.
[02:06:02.103 --> 02:06:05.182]   Whereas if you really study history and things, there's a lot of people that are doing all
[02:06:05.182 --> 02:06:09.783]   sorts of things, pansexual people, there's people that become straight, then they become
[02:06:09.783 --> 02:06:11.542]  that, then they go back to that.
[02:06:11.542 --> 02:06:15.703]   So the idea that the left says, "Once you're something, you're always that," that seems
[02:06:15.703 --> 02:06:17.582]  like another form of tyranny to me.
[02:06:17.823 --> 02:06:20.668]  So I think it takes a lot of courage for you to come out and say this.
[02:06:20.708 --> 02:06:26.557]  And when I first saw it, I haven't seen you in a year or so, seeing you in person and going out to dinner, I do pick up there's quite a change.
[02:06:27.057 --> 02:06:27.337]  Hi Alex.
[02:06:27.397 --> 02:06:27.598]  It's crazy.
[02:06:27.618 --> 02:06:28.098]  I'm from the U.S.
[02:06:27.938 --> 02:06:29.417]  the whole vibe, everything.
[02:06:29.417 --> 02:06:30.817]  But I thought you were a nice person before.
[02:06:30.817 --> 02:06:33.097]   I think you're just as nice now, but you certainly are different.
[02:06:33.097 --> 02:06:35.018]  So we'll talk about that when we start the next hour.
[02:06:35.018 --> 02:06:35.856]  That's really interesting.
[02:06:35.856 --> 02:06:41.777]   But Lane, and I'm sorry to gender you, a man or woman from British Columbia, Canada.
[02:06:41.777 --> 02:06:44.136]  What is your take on the madness up in Canada?
[02:06:44.136 --> 02:06:46.136]  Hi, Alex.
[02:06:46.136 --> 02:06:48.698]  It's crazy.
[02:06:48.698 --> 02:06:50.976]  You know, I'm from the US.
[02:06:50.976 --> 02:06:56.177]   You know, I came up here, oh, 10 years ago, immigrated to Ottawa of all places.
[02:06:56.177 --> 02:07:01.177]   And, you know, there was a time where I used to go down to Canada Day and shake hands
[02:07:01.177 --> 02:07:02.858]  with the RCMP Mounties.
[02:07:02.858 --> 02:07:08.976]   And now they're being trained by the UN, you know, volunteering and training with the UN
[02:07:08.976 --> 02:07:11.056]  to come back and police their people.
[02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:13.382]  Um, you know, it's really sad.
[02:07:13.422 --> 02:07:20.308]  You know, I've watched, I've watched the changes, you know, I, I, my mind goes back to, you know, put it back to Randy Weaver to 9-11.
[02:07:20.688 --> 02:07:47.378]   And, uh, you know, when I was a kid, I used to, Go out with my daddy with a John Bircher and then we used to go out and sell Constitutions door-to-door and now I'm sitting here in Canada in Martial law quite quite ironic You know, it's You know another thing I used to I live in a small town now, but I used to live in Vancouver and We used to walk the streets.
[02:07:47.438 --> 02:07:58.157]   I've been through all these protests from You know, Greta to BLM and all this stuff and the Vancouver police used to escort the protesters through the streets.
[02:07:58.238 --> 02:07:59.439]  They were really decent.
[02:08:00.180 --> 02:08:01.382]  And now look what's happened.
[02:08:01.722 --> 02:08:03.124]  It's just crazy.
[02:08:03.184 --> 02:08:05.107]  They stopped Canada Day last year.
[02:08:06.788 --> 02:08:13.372]  Oh yeah, you're in the fools, and again, okay, ticket people, okay, tow their vehicles, okay, maybe they go to jail for three hours.
[02:08:13.692 --> 02:08:19.316]  You don't no-bail and declare an emergency and say ten years in prison, you're a terrorist, and grab their bank accounts.
[02:08:19.376 --> 02:08:22.338]  I mean, folks, on a scale of one to ten, they're hitting a ten right now.
[02:08:23.439 --> 02:08:23.999]  That's right.
[02:08:24.099 --> 02:08:31.304]  You know, actually, when I first got to Vancouver, you know, I was well aware of Agenda 21, you know, fifteen, twenty years ago.
[02:08:32.290 --> 02:08:35.233]  And, you know, it's the model city, I tell you.
[02:08:35.273 --> 02:08:41.558]  You know, they've got their eyes on Canada, you know, and have had for a long time.
[02:08:41.718 --> 02:08:42.919]  You know, you just see it.
[02:08:42.999 --> 02:08:53.288]  You know, and everything's shut down and they're continuing to build the buildings and bringing all their, you know, their Agenda 21, 2030 Sustainable Development, you know, Act.
[02:08:53.368 --> 02:08:59.233]  And, you know, there's a book called The Fourth Turning, you know, and this is kind of their handbook, you know.
[02:08:59.613 --> 02:09:00.494]  We're in this cycle.
[02:09:01.218 --> 02:09:01.639]  Exactly.
[02:09:01.679 --> 02:09:05.965]  They called the Fourth Industrial Revolution to stop the fourth turning that they believe will unseat them.
[02:09:06.005 --> 02:09:06.907]  Beautifully said.
[02:09:07.307 --> 02:09:07.828]  Thank you.
[02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:10.072]  From Colin from Canada.
[02:09:10.232 --> 02:09:11.113]  My last... Strauss, isn't it?
[02:09:11.133 --> 02:09:13.136]  It's one of Steve Bannon's favorite books, I think, The Fourth.
[02:09:13.537 --> 02:09:13.697]  Yeah.
[02:09:13.857 --> 02:09:16.581]  And he speaks very powerfully and intelligently and interestingly about that.
[02:09:18.363 --> 02:09:24.608]  Everybody thinks that they are living through the most important time that's ever happened because everybody's basis for comparison is themselves.
[02:09:24.648 --> 02:09:28.791]  We all have this egotistical idea that we're living through the most important time ever.
[02:09:28.851 --> 02:09:33.194]  And if you were living during the fall of Rome and the Visigoths were sacking Rome, then maybe you have a reasonable claim to that.
[02:09:33.475 --> 02:09:37.498]  Or if you were living, perhaps, through the cresting of the Industrial Revolution, if you were living in the Reformation.
[02:09:39.798 --> 02:09:42.840]  We now, I think, have enough evidence to know we really are living in one of those moments.
[02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:48.523]  We really are at a point where the crust has cracked on the elites that run the world.
[02:09:50.204 --> 02:09:52.945]  Man, Milo, you were always articulate, but now you're, like, next level.
[02:09:53.345 --> 02:09:56.927]  Repeat that, and I want to take what he just said and put that right on the front of the show today when we archive it.
[02:09:57.227 --> 02:10:03.471]  That little clip, because, exactly, there's no doubt now, like, I'm using somebody who's got nerves of steel.
[02:10:04.351 --> 02:10:06.174]  And now I'm like, ugh, ugh!
[02:10:06.214 --> 02:10:07.976]  Me too!
[02:10:08.296 --> 02:10:10.499]  I'm waking up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night.
[02:10:10.519 --> 02:10:14.163]  I hear it rustling outside, I think they're going to Roger Stone me, you know?
[02:10:14.523 --> 02:10:16.386]  And as you say, I'm retired.
[02:10:16.406 --> 02:10:17.187]  What have I got to worry about?
[02:10:17.207 --> 02:10:19.890]  We're going to come right back, because I'm telling you folks, it's going down.
[02:10:19.710 --> 02:10:31.579]   hour number four straight ahead so I did it I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[02:10:31.739 --> 02:10:38.985]  I've been training, probably not as much as I should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:10:39.286 --> 02:10:45.091]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some Turbo Force to give me that energy I need to get going.
[02:10:45.111 --> 02:10:58.297]   You know, besides the energy, Turbo Force It is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[02:10:58.657 --> 02:11:02.199]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones Soreless.
[02:11:02.539 --> 02:11:03.439]  I have bad joints.
[02:11:03.759 --> 02:11:04.399]  Thanks, Mom.
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:11.542]  So, this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[02:11:11.722 --> 02:11:15.724]  The quick-release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[02:11:16.144 --> 02:11:27.028]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, TurboForce, that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and Sorelis can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[02:11:27.368 --> 02:11:31.409]  We got cut off by the break here on the Alex Jones Show with Milo Yiannopoulos in the studio.
[02:11:31.869 --> 02:11:37.471]  They got that scene in the Wolf of Wall Street where they're on the yacht, and he wants him to repeat what he said.
[02:11:37.511 --> 02:11:42.473]  He said, say it like you just said it again, because you got cut off by the break, and that was absolutely true.
[02:11:44.335 --> 02:11:47.538]  Everybody interprets history through the lens of themselves.
[02:11:47.598 --> 02:11:53.523]  We all have this egotistical idea that the times that we're living in are the most extraordinary that have ever occurred.
[02:11:53.543 --> 02:11:56.105]  And some people have had some good claims to that in the past.
[02:11:56.145 --> 02:12:04.973]  Maybe if you were living through the fall of Rome, perhaps if you were living during the Industrial Revolution, or as it kicked off, the industriousness of Adam Smith in Scotland.
[02:12:05.774 --> 02:12:08.576]  Or maybe you were living through unhappy times, the Reformation.
[02:12:11.016 --> 02:12:15.139]  Now I think we have a reasonable claim to be living through one of those if not the greatest.
[02:12:15.179 --> 02:12:18.182]  We talked about The Fourth Turning a little moment ago, one of Steve Bannon's favorite books.
[02:12:19.963 --> 02:12:24.987]  The crust is cracking at this exact moment on the elites who run the world.
[02:12:25.347 --> 02:12:28.249]  They have for a long time had this sort of carapace around them.
[02:12:28.530 --> 02:12:37.957]  You know like those bugs that are supposed to be able to, cockroaches, that are supposed to be able to survive a nuclear winter because they've got these nuclear resistant carapaces, they're outer exoskeletons, right?
[02:12:38.857 --> 02:12:44.080]  Well, for a long time it looked as though the global elite had something like that adamantium exoskeleton.
[02:12:44.100 --> 02:12:46.040]  They were just never going to be unseated.
[02:12:46.361 --> 02:12:50.682]  But the crust is cracking because, as ever, the devil overplays his hand.
[02:12:50.983 --> 02:12:52.503]  Satan always overplays his hand.
[02:12:52.823 --> 02:12:58.366]  And whatever dark occult forces are fueling the people who rule over us, they are once again overplaying their hand.
[02:12:58.386 --> 02:12:59.506]  You see it with January 6th.
[02:12:59.826 --> 02:13:05.269]  The people who were at January 6th are not going to have a happy time in the next 10 years, but the rest of the country is now awake.
[02:13:05.749 --> 02:13:13.636]  Even if they don't admit it, even if they don't realize it, even if they don't want to say it, they might not be Republicans, they might hate Trump, but they saw that and they noticed.
[02:13:14.056 --> 02:13:17.099]  And they know that it could be a different administration in power tomorrow.
[02:13:17.599 --> 02:13:23.264]  And in just the same way as just happened in Canada, I mean, my goodness, the trucker thing is even worse in many respects.
[02:13:24.045 --> 02:13:26.687]  The crust is cracking and everyone can see them now for what they are.
[02:13:27.047 --> 02:13:39.658]  It's a mask slip moment in which we're beginning to see the sort of hideous, desiccated, gargoyle, demon faces behind these happy, clappy, anodyne newsreaders on ABC.
[02:13:40.018 --> 02:13:41.879]  We're starting to see that in celebrities too, aren't we?
[02:13:42.059 --> 02:13:45.102]  Whether it's a lack of adrenochrome or they're just really, really stressed.
[02:13:45.482 --> 02:13:47.904]  Look at how old celebrities look compared to 2019.
[02:13:49.085 --> 02:13:54.590]  Look at how drawn and haggard and grey and practically translucent their skin is.
[02:13:55.030 --> 02:13:59.373]  Look at how haggard the people who rule over us are suddenly starting to look.
[02:13:59.754 --> 02:14:03.477]  And you realise that they know, as we know, that the crust is cracking.
[02:14:05.427 --> 02:14:06.949]  Man, that was beautifully said.
[02:14:07.470 --> 02:14:08.912]  Absolutely beautifully said.
[02:14:08.992 --> 02:14:14.679]  And of course, right when you started, I hit my cough button and forgot I hit the live button and cut off the first thing you said.
[02:14:14.699 --> 02:14:19.025]  But the first thing you said, because I'm going to edit it together so we can put it out for posterity.
[02:14:19.405 --> 02:14:20.767]  The first line you said was...
[02:14:21.934 --> 02:14:24.616]  Everybody thinks they're living in the most important time in history.
[02:14:24.856 --> 02:14:25.056]  Right.
[02:14:25.096 --> 02:14:33.181]  We all believe that we're living through the most extraordinary period in human history because we all filter everything through the lens of me, me, me, right?
[02:14:34.002 --> 02:14:45.969]  Some people who have been living in important periods in history, we are now incontrovertibly, without doubt, you know, as divorced from our own egotism, living at one of those moments where humanity succeeds or fails.
[02:14:46.490 --> 02:14:49.491]  And it feels like this is bigger than all the ones before.
[02:14:49.511 --> 02:14:53.888]   I mean, because There's more people, there's more weapons, there's more technology.
[02:14:53.928 --> 02:14:58.312]  You can see that everything was a foreshadowing of what happened before.
[02:14:58.352 --> 02:15:02.135]  Whether Atlantis was real or not, we now have technologies that can destroy the planet.
[02:15:02.435 --> 02:15:07.559]  We now are god-like, but we still have the same... And we're giving them to places like Iran.
[02:15:08.901 --> 02:15:19.607]   Our governments are handing, at least handing permission, to administrations like Iran, who want to wipe Parts of the earth?
[02:15:19.667 --> 02:15:21.307]  Off the edge?
[02:15:21.387 --> 02:15:24.948]  Whatever you think about Israel, my views are sort of shifting and evolving on that subject.
[02:15:25.168 --> 02:15:26.849]  But whatever, we don't want to hand nuclear weapons out.
[02:15:26.889 --> 02:15:27.789]  It's not about that.
[02:15:27.909 --> 02:15:32.230]  The point is, we are handing each other permission for mutual destruction.
[02:15:32.530 --> 02:15:32.970]  Exactly.
[02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:33.290]  Annihilation.
[02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:35.631]  Liberation of things that will destroy civilization.
[02:15:35.771 --> 02:15:38.792]  We were supposed to have the UN World Government to stop all that.
[02:15:38.892 --> 02:15:42.132]  I was never for world government, but before I was born, world governments to stop it.
[02:15:42.352 --> 02:15:44.333]  But then the world governors are handing the weapons out.
[02:15:45.093 --> 02:15:47.795]  It's like passing the Kool-Aid with cyanide out there.
[02:15:47.835 --> 02:15:49.577]  Coronavirus is exactly the same thing.
[02:15:49.857 --> 02:15:54.280]  Just another thing that with a little tweak, a little gain of function, could wipe out whoever they want to wipe out.
[02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:55.541]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[02:15:55.661 --> 02:15:55.961]  Wow.
[02:15:56.702 --> 02:15:58.763]  Milo Yiannopoulos is on fire, but not in the old way.
[02:16:00.084 --> 02:16:00.765]  No longer flame.
[02:16:01.085 --> 02:16:06.629]  Well, obviously, Milo Yiannopoulos was the hottest thing in libertarian conservative politics in 2014, 15, 16.
[02:16:07.390 --> 02:16:15.789]   in 2014, '15, '16, and then the system shut him down and cut him off, but he hadn't built his own infrastructure.
[02:16:15.789 --> 02:16:21.069]   So he's still been big and done a lot of things, but kind of smartly receded behind the scenes.
[02:16:21.069 --> 02:16:24.109]   And I know some of the inside baseball still been doing a lot of important work,
[02:16:24.109 --> 02:16:25.749]  but now behind the scenes, he's actually a smart guy.
[02:16:25.749 --> 02:16:29.990]   He used to be a big, one of the top guys at a major newspaper over in the UK.
[02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:31.390]  So that's where he cut his teeth.
[02:16:31.390 --> 02:16:33.809]  But here he is with us now.
[02:16:33.809 --> 02:16:38.829]   And for me, I didn't know if it was a gimmick or not a year ago when they said he wasn't
[02:16:38.829 --> 02:16:41.109]  homosexual anymore.
[02:16:41.109 --> 02:16:43.550]  'Cause I'm a heterosexualist.
[02:16:43.550 --> 02:16:48.690]   Don't say homosexual, it's all, don't say Caucasian, don't say scientific terms.
[02:16:48.690 --> 02:16:51.109]  But the point is, I don't judge anybody.
[02:16:51.109 --> 02:16:55.328]   But then now, going to dinner the other night with MTG and you and everything,
[02:16:55.328 --> 02:16:59.870]   you were always super articulate, but there is something different about you now,
[02:16:59.870 --> 02:17:05.813]   and you're gone from very articulate to ultra articulate so you do seem kinda like
[02:17:05.813 --> 02:17:12.012]   you've been upgraded or something and I'm not saying because you no longer like men. I'm saying something
[02:17:12.012 --> 02:17:16.162]   definitely happened to you so what went on? I'm happy to say that I've got an upgrade
[02:17:16.162 --> 02:17:19.643]   because I've scrubbed out my life. Look, nobody changes overnight from
[02:17:19.643 --> 02:17:25.013]   gay to straight but I I like to say I'm retired mostly to excuse my expanding
[02:17:25.013 --> 02:17:28.092]   waistline um but yeah
[02:17:28.326 --> 02:17:29.807]  Retirement comes with a lot of calories.
[02:17:30.888 --> 02:17:47.602]   No, I mean, the real reason is that I have I never wanted to be one of those people, and we both have those friends in common, who get cancelled and then do this kind of, like, endlessly pathetic, desperate sort of clinging on, you know, for years and years.
[02:17:47.682 --> 02:17:49.343]  Oh, cancellation's the best thing that ever happened to me.
[02:17:49.383 --> 02:17:50.244]  We all know it's not.
[02:17:50.544 --> 02:17:54.907]  We all know that you've moved into a little rented flat.
[02:17:55.087 --> 02:17:56.368]  I didn't want to do that.
[02:17:56.428 --> 02:18:05.755]  I just thought I'm going to gracefully excuse myself from the house party where I was told I wasn't welcome and do something else for a bit.
[02:18:05.775 --> 02:18:07.997]  So I've been working a lot behind the scenes with various people.
[02:18:08.097 --> 02:18:12.721]  I just didn't want to spend four years whining about cancel culture and playing the victim.
[02:18:13.482 --> 02:18:27.155]  And so I thought I'd go and do other things and I've been drawing a lot closer to God and I have spent a lot of time as my new colleagues at Church Milton, which is a tremendous Catholic news operation in Detroit now, investing in my spiritual life.
[02:18:27.515 --> 02:18:53.092]   I have been spending since the sort of big cancellation and I mean look you and I are two of the seven people who helped to put Trump in office right we would and and we have both paid the price in various different ways and I just decided that I would try to Do the dignified thing, and if, you know, it was going to be difficult to live in public because I hadn't built something like this yet, I hadn't been going for as long as you, you know, I hadn't built any of this yet, that I was just going to do some other things.
[02:18:53.372 --> 02:19:03.515]  I found that during that time, with having a lot more time on my hands while I was styling myself as retired, I felt a call back to the religion of my youth.
[02:19:03.655 --> 02:19:06.336]  My first job in journalism ever was at the Catholic Herald in London.
[02:19:06.356 --> 02:19:08.417]  Maybe that was my second job.
[02:19:09.177 --> 02:19:20.661]  I felt a calling from the faith of my youth and one day I woke... Look, you'll remember from 2015 me giving talks on college campuses saying the Catholic Church is right about everything.
[02:19:20.921 --> 02:19:29.223]  So my opinions haven't changed but what the difference between me now and five years ago, the thing that has changed is I'm trying now to no longer be a hypocrite.
[02:19:29.644 --> 02:19:33.685]  I'm trying now to actually live according to the values that I have always professed for others.
[02:19:34.585 --> 02:19:37.066]  And I just woke up one day and said I can't have this in my life anymore.
[02:19:37.366 --> 02:19:42.492]  Well, you do seem, I would say, better looking, happier, even more articulate.
[02:19:43.012 --> 02:19:43.573]  I mean, no seriously.
[02:19:43.593 --> 02:19:44.795]  That's going on the back of the next book.
[02:19:44.835 --> 02:19:45.295]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:19:45.696 --> 02:19:46.657]  No, but I mean, I'm serious.
[02:19:46.677 --> 02:19:49.700]  The times I was around you, you're a charming, nice person, smart.
[02:19:50.261 --> 02:19:54.325]  But there's still like an unsettling feeling like you weren't happy.
[02:19:54.806 --> 02:19:55.767]  So you weren't secure.
[02:19:55.867 --> 02:19:57.829]  I pick up a manly security now.
[02:19:58.530 --> 02:20:06.272]  I will tell you, there's people who are still in the conservative movement, still doing the, you know, desperate scrambling for attention and money and all the rest of it.
[02:20:06.352 --> 02:20:11.693]  Lots of homosexuals, unfortunately, are in the populist, nationalist, conservative movement.
[02:20:11.713 --> 02:20:15.173]  Yeah, I would say there's more homosexuals in the Republicans than Democrats.
[02:20:15.213 --> 02:20:16.354]  Well, at the top.
[02:20:16.774 --> 02:20:18.214]  But more pedophiles than Democrats.
[02:20:18.294 --> 02:20:18.954]  I think that's right.
[02:20:19.114 --> 02:20:19.674]  I think that's right.
[02:20:19.734 --> 02:20:23.435]  And you know, right-wing politics, no matter what the country, has always had a gay problem.
[02:20:24.175 --> 02:20:24.536]  Always.
[02:20:24.576 --> 02:20:28.559]  I mean, you know, you look at the Tory party in Britain, there's a lot going on in there.
[02:20:29.039 --> 02:20:40.367]  There are still those people who are scrambling, some of whom I think I enabled by kind of, you know, reinventing the whole, you can be a gay right-winger genre, which I regret and I will be atoning for for the rest of my life.
[02:20:40.708 --> 02:20:47.613]  You know, I know you have some troubles, Alex, but you don't wake up in the middle of the night realising you're responsible for Lady Marga and Rob Smith.
[02:20:48.033 --> 02:20:49.094]  I have to bear that cross.
[02:20:53.456 --> 02:21:05.341]  There are those homosexuals still scrambling for attention, scrambling for money, and I look at them and I see where I was, and I am a greatly enhanced, I think, human being.
[02:21:06.061 --> 02:21:13.884]  All I know is what you just nailed of the whole gay genre wavelength, because I'm very empathic, I pick up on people's emotions.
[02:21:14.664 --> 02:21:16.185]  You're so right about that.
[02:21:16.024 --> 02:21:19.863]   to be part of a group. Kind of like gang members whether they be white, black or
[02:21:19.863 --> 02:21:23.545]   Hispanic go under a guy because they didn't have a dad. He might not be having sex with
[02:21:23.545 --> 02:21:26.664]   them but he's having them commit crimes looking for a father figure and they
[02:21:26.664 --> 02:21:30.824]   seem like men that aren't able to find a father figure they're out constantly
[02:21:30.824 --> 02:21:34.703]   looking for it. I know that's a cliche but that's really what it is. You're so right about that. Do you
[02:21:34.703 --> 02:21:40.104]   remember the nickname I came up with for Trump? Daddy. Do you recall that?
[02:21:38.533 --> 02:21:41.375]  What else was I doing except looking for a father figure?
[02:21:41.415 --> 02:21:44.197]  You can't see it when you're there in it, but you see it in retrospect.
[02:21:44.257 --> 02:21:47.239]  I'm like, yikes!
[02:21:47.339 --> 02:21:47.840]  I see it now.
[02:21:48.780 --> 02:21:50.161]  Men are supposed to become the father.
[02:21:51.042 --> 02:21:52.063]  That's what I'm telling people.
[02:21:52.083 --> 02:21:53.463]  They want to arrest development.
[02:21:53.884 --> 02:21:55.565]  I'm not hating anybody for what they do.
[02:21:55.765 --> 02:22:00.248]  I'm just saying, leave kids alone, but men, you need to step into your office as men.
[02:22:00.448 --> 02:22:01.449]  I feel like you're starting to do that.
[02:22:04.530 --> 02:22:13.873]  My way back into the Catholic Church, which is the brand of Christianity I've arrived at as the one true faith, was through St.
[02:22:13.913 --> 02:22:17.493]  Joseph, through a father figure, because it's something that I didn't have.
[02:22:18.214 --> 02:22:24.295]  And, you know, who knows if I'm ever going to have a burning desire for a woman in my, you know, in my nether regions.
[02:22:24.995 --> 02:22:25.635]  We live in hope.
[02:22:25.995 --> 02:22:27.976]  I'm doing the conversion therapy, they say.
[02:22:28.036 --> 02:22:28.896]  Well, I sure haven't.
[02:22:32.920 --> 02:22:35.022]  I'm doing the conversion therapy they say doesn't work.
[02:22:35.182 --> 02:22:35.543]  It does.
[02:22:36.203 --> 02:22:38.846]  You know, they told the same lies about that in the 80s and 90s.
[02:22:39.006 --> 02:22:42.930]  They told about Trump and him and me, you know, half a decade ago.
[02:22:43.531 --> 02:22:44.131]  Of course it works.
[02:22:44.231 --> 02:22:45.072]  Of course it works.
[02:22:45.112 --> 02:22:46.033]  It's not your natural state.
[02:22:46.413 --> 02:22:48.415]  Hot women, it's like a helicopter you want to ride on.
[02:22:49.176 --> 02:22:50.136]  I mean, I'm a Christian.
[02:22:50.176 --> 02:22:53.138]  I'm not trying to put women down either, but I appreciate what the Lord made.
[02:22:53.198 --> 02:22:55.218]  I'm just like, you know, I need to behave myself.
[02:22:55.558 --> 02:22:57.999]  Who knows if I'll ever get there, but I will tell you this.
[02:22:58.099 --> 02:23:04.602]  When you, when I would now describe myself, I guess, as a celibate, a celibate, uh, when you cut that chasing.
[02:23:05.402 --> 02:23:11.144]  As you correctly intuited, because you're very good with human insight, which is one of your great gifts.
[02:23:12.605 --> 02:23:25.670]  When you cut out that chasing, that desperate scrambling, you know, that sort of, like you're clattering, trying to get out of a hole, and you don't know what direction you're going in, and you just want an arm to grab onto, and you'll grab onto almost anything.
[02:23:26.191 --> 02:23:31.413]  When you cut that out of your life and just say, well, I'm just not going to do that, the first six months are hell.
[02:23:32.353 --> 02:23:34.594]  After that, it's extraordinarily liberating.
[02:23:34.954 --> 02:23:42.678]  Like anybody who's come... Well, I think that for a heterosexual that's addicted to sex, and when I was younger, I certainly was, it was very liberating to stop doing that as well.
[02:23:42.938 --> 02:23:43.098]  Right.
[02:23:43.138 --> 02:23:44.399]  Because it becomes a scrambling.
[02:23:44.439 --> 02:23:48.441]  Like, you're at the bar, you're picking up this woman, you're doing this, and it's not fulfilling.
[02:23:48.501 --> 02:23:49.942]  It functions exactly as an addiction.
[02:23:50.402 --> 02:23:55.564]  Uh, you know, whether it's homosexuality or whether it's just, you know, being a young, handsome guy with a little bit too much on offer.
[02:23:56.004 --> 02:24:00.325]  It functions exactly as an addiction, and the way I think of it... No, and I agree, and I think both are just as destructive.
[02:24:00.605 --> 02:24:07.547]  When I think of my past now, I view it and I feel about it very much as though I've, I've, I'm working to shake myself free of an addiction.
[02:24:07.747 --> 02:24:08.227]  Powerful.
[02:24:08.307 --> 02:24:09.587]  Milo Yiannopoulos in the studio.
[02:24:10.308 --> 02:24:12.248]  Alright, Milo Yiannopoulos is our guest.
[02:24:12.288 --> 02:24:12.968]  Final segment.
[02:24:13.028 --> 02:24:14.489]  I'm gonna have to address this.
[02:24:15.914 --> 02:24:19.955]  CNN special they've got Sunday night, and the reason I gotta address it is it's lies.
[02:24:20.955 --> 02:24:27.957]  And if they kill me or put me in prison, I'm not being dramatic, I don't want the stuff they're putting in there to tank the message we've put out over the years.
[02:24:27.977 --> 02:24:31.358]  It's not about me being attacked, it's about they want to attack the messenger.
[02:24:31.778 --> 02:24:33.499]  And it's some evil ass stuff.
[02:24:34.019 --> 02:24:34.919]  You think CNN's bad?
[02:24:34.959 --> 02:24:35.879]  They've gone next level.
[02:24:36.140 --> 02:24:37.440]  They don't give up, they just get worse.
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:44.582]  Milo, I brought up True Social to you, and then you said, oh my gosh, let me talk about that.
[02:24:45.553 --> 02:24:50.397]  And boy, you know, Trump is really against censorship, he says.
[02:24:51.260 --> 02:24:53.861]  But, Tim, I'm told you're not even allowed on there.
[02:24:54.101 --> 02:24:55.601]  Well, it remains to be seen.
[02:24:55.741 --> 02:25:01.263]  So, they've banned their first person for calling Devin Nunes, or whatever his name is, Devin Nunes a cow.
[02:25:02.264 --> 02:25:04.904]  They are already putting warnings up.
[02:25:04.924 --> 02:25:06.545]  So, Stu Peters, you know this guy?
[02:25:06.625 --> 02:25:08.206]  He's a Christian radio host.
[02:25:08.226 --> 02:25:09.006]  Yeah, yeah, and I like Stu.
[02:25:09.026 --> 02:25:10.306]  Yeah, yeah, he seems like a good guy.
[02:25:10.606 --> 02:25:14.248]  So, Stu Peters posted something about... Oh, that's funny.
[02:25:14.288 --> 02:25:15.368]  Nunes is a milk farmer.
[02:25:15.948 --> 02:25:18.090]  Right, so someone put- I mean, who cares?
[02:25:18.830 --> 02:25:20.912]  Someone's username was David Nunes-Cow.
[02:25:21.132 --> 02:25:22.973]  Excuse me, what's his name?
[02:25:23.553 --> 02:25:24.114]  It's David, isn't it?
[02:25:24.174 --> 02:25:25.054]  Nunes-Cow, yeah.
[02:25:25.134 --> 02:25:25.555]  There we go.
[02:25:25.935 --> 02:25:30.818]  David Nunes-Cow, and they got banned for being disrespectful to him, apparently.
[02:25:31.599 --> 02:25:32.920]  I guess that's what it was about.
[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:33.260]  Perfect.
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:35.562]  We launched our right-wing social network and we're as bad as the left.
[02:25:35.582 --> 02:25:37.383]  And you can't make jokes about right-wingers.
[02:25:37.543 --> 02:25:37.943]  Oops.
[02:25:38.504 --> 02:25:41.286]  But I love that they fell right in the trap.
[02:25:41.886 --> 02:25:47.492]  Yeah, well, look, it's a left-wing guy who did it because he was testing the limits of the network, but they failed at the first hurdle.
[02:25:47.933 --> 02:25:53.759]  And then Stu Peters is talking about what should happen to the people who put all these COVID restrictions on us.
[02:25:53.779 --> 02:25:55.461]  He's saying they should be prosecuted and punished.
[02:25:55.961 --> 02:25:58.464]  And now he's got this, oh, sensitive content.
[02:25:58.764 --> 02:25:59.865]  It's like, where are we?
[02:26:00.226 --> 02:26:02.288]  All these websites look like clones of Twitter.
[02:26:02.328 --> 02:26:04.770]  It looks like they're cloning the terms of service, too.
[02:26:05.331 --> 02:26:06.472]  What is a sensitive content?
[02:26:06.612 --> 02:26:13.979]  Sorry, somebody who's signing up for Donald Trump's social network is so fragile they can't hear that you think that COVID, uh, uh, uh, panic is?
[02:26:14.059 --> 02:26:15.741]  Oh, we can't call Nunes a cow?
[02:26:15.781 --> 02:26:17.322]  No, you can't call Nunes a cow!
[02:26:17.382 --> 02:26:18.483]  I love Devin Nunes.
[02:26:18.704 --> 02:26:19.384]  Devin Nunes.
[02:26:19.424 --> 02:26:21.006]  I mean, he's a good guy, but it's not the point, right?
[02:26:21.026 --> 02:26:21.967]  Who splashed to famous people?
[02:26:22.427 --> 02:26:24.069]  You want to be attacked, it's fun!
[02:26:24.609 --> 02:26:26.892]  Everybody loves it when you go along, it's fun!
[02:26:27.052 --> 02:26:29.474]  Attack me, make fun of me, let's go!
[02:26:29.594 --> 02:26:33.038]  This is the great unsung lie of public life.
[02:26:33.378 --> 02:26:41.766]  When you come for a celebrity, very famously, if you'll recall, I called Leslie Jones a man, and all the rest of it.
[02:26:42.187 --> 02:26:47.373]   When you come for a celebrity, they don't go, Oh no, I'm really hurt.
[02:26:47.453 --> 02:26:48.214]  I'm wounded.
[02:26:48.274 --> 02:26:48.854]  I'm upset.
[02:26:49.135 --> 02:26:50.497]  How am I going to get out of bed tomorrow?
[02:26:50.577 --> 02:26:52.379]  Someone online thinks I'm ugly.
[02:26:52.639 --> 02:26:53.661]  That's what leftists do.
[02:26:53.761 --> 02:26:56.124]  No, well, no, but, I mean, it's what they perform.
[02:26:56.384 --> 02:26:59.067]  But really what happens is, great, we got some attention.
[02:26:59.107 --> 02:27:00.609]  How are we going to parlay this?
[02:27:00.649 --> 02:27:02.452]  How are we going to twist or, or, or?
[02:27:02.592 --> 02:27:02.952]  Exactly.
[02:27:03.493 --> 02:27:04.194]  You're hitting the key here.
[02:27:04.294 --> 02:27:07.918]  So many of the old Republicans, like Mitch McConnell, all of them, they only care about corporate media.
[02:27:08.139 --> 02:27:09.540]  They should want to be demonized.
[02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:11.763]  They should want to be outlawed.
[02:27:11.783 --> 02:27:13.085]  It gives you power.
[02:27:13.385 --> 02:27:13.906]  Look at you.
[02:27:13.946 --> 02:27:14.707]  Look at MTG.
[02:27:14.747 --> 02:27:15.147]  Look at me.
[02:27:15.187 --> 02:27:15.728]  Look at Trump.
[02:27:15.788 --> 02:27:16.809]  It gives you power.
[02:27:19.372 --> 02:27:28.036]  One of the great lies of public life is that trolling, harassment, all the rest of it, are in any way hurtful to their subjects, to their objects.
[02:27:28.256 --> 02:27:28.676]  They're not.
[02:27:28.897 --> 02:27:30.397]  You're doing the guy a favor.
[02:27:30.657 --> 02:27:33.679]  It is a mutually symbiotic beneficial relationship.
[02:27:33.699 --> 02:27:34.199]  What did P.G.
[02:27:34.239 --> 02:27:35.079]  Burnham say?
[02:27:35.099 --> 02:27:36.320]  Just spell my name right.
[02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:37.981]  Yes, exactly, exactly.
[02:27:38.001 --> 02:27:39.021]  Well, they can't even do that with me.
[02:27:39.041 --> 02:27:41.162]  Obviously, even I can barely spell it all the time.
[02:27:41.522 --> 02:27:43.623]  But you're on the phone to the electricity company.
[02:27:43.663 --> 02:27:44.504]  Can you spell Yiannopoulos?
[02:27:45.404 --> 02:27:47.086]  I'm going to get a credit card out sometime.
[02:27:47.466 --> 02:27:49.608]  But look, they love it.
[02:27:49.928 --> 02:27:50.449]  They love it.
[02:27:50.569 --> 02:27:53.731]  And then they have the gall, the chutzpah, to go and pretend.
[02:27:53.751 --> 02:27:54.412]  I'll tell you a story.
[02:27:54.432 --> 02:27:55.152]  Pretend that they miss it.
[02:27:55.172 --> 02:27:57.614]  I'm in the January 6th committee and I know how to spell my middle name.
[02:27:58.215 --> 02:28:00.857]  And they go, is it the normal spelling or the not normal?
[02:28:01.257 --> 02:28:05.761]  And I was like, during the headlines, I go, I don't know my middle name.
[02:28:06.682 --> 02:28:07.663]  It was like this weird thing.
[02:28:10.137 --> 02:28:11.217]  That's so funny.
[02:28:11.237 --> 02:28:11.958]  But I knew my middle name.
[02:28:11.978 --> 02:28:12.658]  I knew how to spell it.
[02:28:12.678 --> 02:28:13.098]  No, no, I understand.
[02:28:13.118 --> 02:28:13.538]  I understand.
[02:28:13.738 --> 02:28:14.038]  I understand.
[02:28:14.058 --> 02:28:19.740]  No, look, when you get into... Because the absurdity of these Democrat lawyers like wolves on the screen like, what's your middle name?
[02:28:19.780 --> 02:28:20.581]  Why are you spelling?
[02:28:20.841 --> 02:28:21.541]  I was like, what?
[02:28:21.961 --> 02:28:23.462]  But this is how it got stoned, you know?
[02:28:23.542 --> 02:28:28.764]  Like these minor little inconsistencies in 300 questions over the course of two hours.
[02:28:28.784 --> 02:28:29.964]  Like, got him, got him, got him.
[02:28:29.984 --> 02:28:31.004]  It's like, what are you talking about?
[02:28:31.024 --> 02:28:31.545]  I was so confused.
[02:28:32.025 --> 02:28:32.245]  Anyway.
[02:28:32.745 --> 02:28:41.253]  So, True Social, first of all, you can't call Devin Nunes a cow, apparently, and Stu... He doesn't get by them doing that, he'll be now known as the cow!
[02:28:42.114 --> 02:28:50.322]  And our pal Stu Peters can't post without a sensitive content warning what he thinks should happen to COVID conspirators.
[02:28:50.542 --> 02:28:58.308]   And finally, personally, not that I like to make everything about me, but personally, I introduced the Truth Social team to all the America First guys.
[02:28:58.348 --> 02:29:02.411]  Nick Fuentes, you've had on the show, a bunch of other people.
[02:29:02.691 --> 02:29:04.032]  I gave them all the email addresses.
[02:29:04.052 --> 02:29:08.535]  I was like, let's test the limits of what Truth Social will tolerate.
[02:29:09.276 --> 02:29:17.361]  And I get all these wacky, weird, and wonderful, dangerous people, plus a load of just really great, young America First conservatives.
[02:29:17.682 --> 02:29:21.764]  So now, 40 or 50 of their highest value users, I introduced them to.
[02:29:22.825 --> 02:29:26.268]  But I don't have an account, and they've stopped responding to me.
[02:29:26.688 --> 02:29:30.672]  And now they won't reply and say whether I can even be on the network myself.
[02:29:30.812 --> 02:29:34.575]  And that, I'm sorry to say, is such classic Trump.
[02:29:35.195 --> 02:29:36.376]  That is classic Trump.
[02:29:36.416 --> 02:29:39.119]  And the headline is going to be, Milo begs to be on Truth Social.
[02:29:39.159 --> 02:29:40.420]  No, I don't want it now!
[02:29:40.780 --> 02:29:46.805]  What I'm saying is, is it literally, I wish Trump could put forward with two billion dollars.
[02:29:46.825 --> 02:29:48.066]  You ought to have a real Death Star for that.
[02:29:48.426 --> 02:29:49.927]  It shoots lasers and blows the moon up.
[02:29:50.387 --> 02:29:55.871]  Instead, it's this thing disintegrating with a bunch of leftists inside of it repeating censorship.
[02:29:56.531 --> 02:29:58.692]  It's just what they call a monkey F.U.C.
[02:29:58.772 --> 02:29:59.713]  you-know-what of football.
[02:29:59.913 --> 02:30:00.273]  Right.
[02:30:00.393 --> 02:30:05.216]  I didn't even bother with Getter because it was obvious to me that the people on there were just awful and terminally dull.
[02:30:05.236 --> 02:30:06.337]  It was incredibly boring.
[02:30:06.697 --> 02:30:08.218]  Hey, they got live streaming there.
[02:30:08.238 --> 02:30:12.100]  They weren't the kind of people I wanted to hang out with and not the kind of people that I wanted to hear from.
[02:30:12.161 --> 02:30:13.701]  I just thought, ugh, no, I'll pass.
[02:30:13.741 --> 02:30:14.142]  Thank you.
[02:30:14.802 --> 02:30:16.423]  We need to pimp you out to Getter.
[02:30:16.443 --> 02:30:17.644]  I don't think they're going to be nice to you.
[02:30:18.123 --> 02:30:18.683]  Well, maybe.
[02:30:18.703 --> 02:30:19.103]  We'll see.
[02:30:19.143 --> 02:30:19.404]  We'll see.
[02:30:19.424 --> 02:30:20.224]  We'll call up the head of it.
[02:30:20.264 --> 02:30:26.927]  Everybody says they're gonna be nice to me, and then everybody remembers what it was like in February 2017 when the whole world came on my end.
[02:30:26.947 --> 02:30:28.047]  They're like, you know, I don't want any part of that.
[02:30:28.147 --> 02:30:29.668]  Well, they shouldn't want that controversy.
[02:30:29.828 --> 02:30:31.609]  Well, they should, but people are stupid, Alex.
[02:30:31.689 --> 02:30:32.629]  People are very stupid.
[02:30:32.949 --> 02:30:43.674]  And they actually believe, for instance, that trolling is bad for the object of the trolling, rather than... Everybody, as you correctly say, everybody wants to, or ought to want, to be made fun of, because it's power...
[02:30:45.295 --> 02:30:51.421]  Hey guys, I don't want to say this wrong and my memory's failing.
[02:30:52.062 --> 02:30:53.764]  Look up who owned Super Deluxe.
[02:30:53.864 --> 02:30:54.885]  I want to say it was Paramount.
[02:30:56.371 --> 02:31:01.753]  But Super Deluxe was putting out monthly videos getting 5, 10, 20 million views attacking me.
[02:31:02.073 --> 02:31:06.535]  And it was totally making all the kids love us because they didn't, these old men were running it.
[02:31:06.555 --> 02:31:08.256]  It's the best thing that's ever happened to you.
[02:31:08.276 --> 02:31:18.200]  But as soon as I said, yeah Turner Broadcasting, as soon as I said, I love Super Deluxe, they cancelled the entire contract and deleted all the videos.
[02:31:19.480 --> 02:31:20.701]  Because they thought it was hurting me.
[02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:26.360]   I was like more super deluxe, please so there's this sunglasses brand called pit vipers that a lot of the
[02:31:26.360 --> 02:31:28.800]   younger guys we're now and I got a couple pairs of these and
[02:31:28.800 --> 02:31:35.880]   And and and it turns out that the pit viper CEOs wife is a vaxed and boosted
[02:31:35.880 --> 02:31:41.970]   Hillary crazy type and she's bullied her husband into disavowing their own customers because their number one customers are
[02:31:41.970 --> 02:31:45.550]   like young Raucous Trump supporting conservatives, so I was texting
[02:31:45.550 --> 02:31:49.399]   everybody saying you got to say on your show. You're sponsored by pit viper
[02:31:49.399 --> 02:31:51.399]  [laughter]
[02:31:51.399 --> 02:31:53.400]  Brought to you by PetFiber.
[02:31:53.501 --> 02:31:57.442]  This hour of casual racism and misogyny brought to you by Pit Viper.
[02:31:59.063 --> 02:32:02.844]  I want to know what the hell's up with these husbands listening to their wives about what is your business.
[02:32:03.604 --> 02:32:07.405]  Like, I love my wife and I love all the women, but they ain't telling me what to do.
[02:32:07.445 --> 02:32:09.486]  She's not head of editorial at InfoWars, you know?
[02:32:09.506 --> 02:32:10.486]  Yeah, she ain't.
[02:32:11.526 --> 02:32:12.286]  No, I have been.
[02:32:14.407 --> 02:32:16.769]  Unfortunately, I think that's more the norm these days, isn't it?
[02:32:16.869 --> 02:32:18.691]  It's sort of, oh yes, okay, darling, oh yes, alright.
[02:32:18.971 --> 02:32:23.075]  So she's a Hillary supporter getting upset about the fact that racist sexism.
[02:32:23.095 --> 02:32:25.957]  She's driving a $100,000 Mercedes, robbing people's money.
[02:32:25.977 --> 02:32:30.381]  She's in her Land Rover Discovery, dropping the kids off, you know, those turbocharged SUV things.
[02:32:30.501 --> 02:32:33.764]  We've got our final segment with the great Milo Yiannopoulos here.
[02:32:34.690 --> 02:32:41.359]  And then I don't know if I'm going to hit this big Joe Rogan piece of news next segment, or CNN has a special out to attack me, but it's Sunday night.
[02:32:41.399 --> 02:32:43.743]  Maybe I cover the CNN lies tomorrow.
[02:32:44.043 --> 02:32:49.931]  Because CNN is not really worth it to talk about attacking me, except these lies are next level.
[02:32:50.612 --> 02:32:52.614]  I mean, total manufactured BS.
[02:32:53.114 --> 02:32:57.177]  So I'm probably going to have to just get it on record for possibility what they're saying.
[02:32:57.257 --> 02:33:00.299]  They've photoshopped you at some sort of vegetarian commune, haven't they?
[02:33:00.359 --> 02:33:04.982]  No, what is the left claim they fight, but they are themselves?
[02:33:06.764 --> 02:33:07.684]  Child rapists?
[02:33:08.705 --> 02:33:09.526]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:33:09.786 --> 02:33:10.586]  What's a child rapist?
[02:33:11.867 --> 02:33:12.408]  They're a bully.
[02:33:12.948 --> 02:33:13.809]  Right, right.
[02:33:15.470 --> 02:33:18.172]  Oh, are they trying to claim that you've been throwing your weight around?
[02:33:18.956 --> 02:33:19.896]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[02:33:19.996 --> 02:33:25.918]  I'm not the toughest guy around, and I'm not perfect, but I think I've cut my teeth on, do I go after little people or big people?
[02:33:25.998 --> 02:33:26.878]  Generally, it's big people.
[02:33:26.918 --> 02:33:29.499]  You typically punch up, which you don't have to.
[02:33:29.519 --> 02:33:35.441]  Look, my experience of it, I'm not just blowing smoke, I'm not one of those people that, you know, orbits you because they want something.
[02:33:35.461 --> 02:33:42.884]   You know, we hang out once every year or something, and I have to tell you, You have always been sweet and kind and generous to me.
[02:33:43.785 --> 02:33:47.448]  You strike me as, you know, you're like the classic archetype of the gentle giant, you know?
[02:33:47.468 --> 02:33:48.409]  General fat guy.
[02:33:50.472 --> 02:33:52.253]  I didn't mean it like that.
[02:33:52.333 --> 02:34:04.458]  I'm just saying you're on air, and you do your thing on air, and I think it's easy for people to imagine that the way that you rail against the globalists on air is the way that you conduct yourself when the cameras stop rolling.
[02:34:04.718 --> 02:34:10.541]  You are the sweetest, kindest, nicest guy that I know in media, honestly.
[02:34:10.601 --> 02:34:14.102]  I don't have a bad word to say about you.
[02:34:14.342 --> 02:34:19.925]  You're one of the nicest people I know on media, too, because a lot of the men in TV and radio, but also women as well, are primadonas.
[02:34:20.385 --> 02:34:20.545]  Yes.
[02:34:20.565 --> 02:34:21.065]  And they're jerks.
[02:34:21.085 --> 02:34:22.946]  And I'm not perfect either, but here's what's happening.
[02:34:22.986 --> 02:34:24.566]  We're very low-maintenance divas, aren't we?
[02:34:24.906 --> 02:34:25.126]  Yes.
[02:34:25.386 --> 02:34:27.107]  I figured this out, though, a few years ago.
[02:34:27.147 --> 02:34:28.367]  Then I got calls about it.
[02:34:28.947 --> 02:34:30.948]  So I know what this CNN thing's about.
[02:34:31.008 --> 02:34:31.588]  It's a lot bigger.
[02:34:31.928 --> 02:34:32.088]  Yeah.
[02:34:32.568 --> 02:34:33.389]  So I want to ask you about this.
[02:34:33.409 --> 02:34:34.149]  You know how media works.
[02:34:34.169 --> 02:34:36.690]  You used to work in the British tabloids.
[02:34:36.750 --> 02:34:44.652]  What they're doing is John Ronson, the big leftist operative who makes the banisteric goats and all these stories, you know, to destroy icons.
[02:34:44.692 --> 02:34:45.712]  He creates false stories.
[02:34:45.872 --> 02:34:46.012]  Yeah.
[02:34:46.532 --> 02:34:56.454]   He is He went and had NPR do a fake story about me that I'm this bully that beat up all these nerds and kids in wheelchairs when I was a kid.
[02:34:57.035 --> 02:34:57.415]  Literally.
[02:34:58.996 --> 02:35:08.246]   And then he has that, and now they're going to have a CNN show about it so he can option the movie Which Leonardo DiCaprio's production company is looking at.
[02:35:09.027 --> 02:35:10.968]  Now, I know this from Hollywood.
[02:35:11.188 --> 02:35:12.749]  No, no, I'm telling you.
[02:35:12.969 --> 02:35:13.909]  I knew about this a year ago.
[02:35:14.049 --> 02:35:22.253]  John Ronson's going around with this movie where I'm literally in Dallas, like, beating kids up in wheelchairs.
[02:35:22.913 --> 02:35:23.754]  But it gets worse.
[02:35:23.834 --> 02:35:26.235]  It gets worse.
[02:35:26.395 --> 02:35:27.296]  I swear to God.
[02:35:27.636 --> 02:35:28.476]  Trite me down, God.
[02:35:28.496 --> 02:35:29.757]  If it's true, it's not.
[02:35:30.257 --> 02:35:30.757]  All lies.
[02:35:30.857 --> 02:35:32.118]  And it gets worse.
[02:35:35.024 --> 02:35:36.986]  So I beat up like a four foot tall nerd.
[02:35:37.006 --> 02:35:39.208]  It was actually like a six foot five guy that attacked me.
[02:35:39.408 --> 02:35:40.930]  Of course I wasn't arrested, he attacked me.
[02:35:41.270 --> 02:35:43.072]  It is true that the guy got put in a coma for a while.
[02:35:43.653 --> 02:35:55.485]  And so they went back and interviewed everybody and then they say that they invited me out to a farm where I'm tied up and then all my, and the nerds beat me up and knocked my teeth out.
[02:35:56.607 --> 02:35:59.670]  So, so, so, so then John Ronson's on NPR saying all this to me.
[02:35:59.730 --> 02:36:00.911]  This is a Stephen King novel.
[02:36:00.951 --> 02:36:02.133]  This is a Stephen King novel.
[02:36:02.153 --> 02:36:03.774]  They've lifted this from a Stephen King novel.
[02:36:03.794 --> 02:36:05.056]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[02:36:05.116 --> 02:36:07.698]  This is kind of like Revenge of the Nerds thing.
[02:36:07.718 --> 02:36:09.220]  Yeah, yeah, it's Revenge of the Nerds!
[02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:13.864]  And Alex Jones is literally... I was like, you're a 50-year-old nerd.
[02:36:14.525 --> 02:36:15.725]  You're it!
[02:36:16.006 --> 02:36:16.966]  You're Pennywise!
[02:36:17.246 --> 02:36:19.347]  You're Pennywise and it's Revenge of the Nerd Kids!
[02:36:19.387 --> 02:36:19.827]  Exactly!
[02:36:19.847 --> 02:36:21.507]  They defeat the kids to defeat Pennywise!
[02:36:21.527 --> 02:36:22.708]  This is the plot of it!
[02:36:22.988 --> 02:36:23.948]  This is the plot of it!
[02:36:23.988 --> 02:36:28.029]  So they're remaking it with Alex Jones as Leonardo DiCaprio!
[02:36:29.050 --> 02:36:29.730]  You want a balloon?
[02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:31.471]  It gets worse.
[02:36:31.851 --> 02:36:37.513]  I'm on NPR with him when he's taping the interview because he wouldn't do it live for whatever that big Sunday show is they did a few years ago.
[02:36:37.573 --> 02:36:44.071]   And he goes, three years ago, he goes, Alex, they tied you up and knocked your teeth out, didn't they?
[02:36:45.031 --> 02:36:47.032]  And I go, uh, no.
[02:36:47.132 --> 02:36:49.792]  And I said, actually, my dad just retired as a dentist.
[02:36:49.812 --> 02:36:50.573]  He's my dentist, my wife.
[02:36:50.933 --> 02:36:51.893]  I need to get my teeth cleaned.
[02:36:51.913 --> 02:36:55.394]  I actually had like a root canal I had to get, but my teeth were all in at that point.
[02:36:55.414 --> 02:36:56.394]  I did lose like one from a root canal.
[02:36:56.414 --> 02:36:57.474]  You got all your originals in.
[02:36:57.714 --> 02:36:58.975]  Yeah, I got originals here.
[02:36:59.015 --> 02:37:01.235]  The point is, is I have medical records.
[02:37:01.295 --> 02:37:03.976]  So I go, hey, don't believe my dad.
[02:37:04.016 --> 02:37:05.056]  I need to get my teeth cleaned.
[02:37:05.616 --> 02:37:08.318]  I will go anywhere you want as long as you pay for it.
[02:37:08.378 --> 02:37:10.020]  You can put x-rays out.
[02:37:10.480 --> 02:37:10.680]  Yeah.
[02:37:11.281 --> 02:37:12.522]  They go, we don't want the x-rays.
[02:37:12.602 --> 02:37:13.282]  No, we don't want the x-rays.
[02:37:13.302 --> 02:37:14.864]  We don't approve of... I'm not joking.
[02:37:14.904 --> 02:37:16.025]  This is the plot of IT.
[02:37:16.485 --> 02:37:19.948]  They have made this up, probably subconsciously, right?
[02:37:20.548 --> 02:37:21.149]  From IT.
[02:37:21.189 --> 02:37:22.230]  Well listen, it gets worse.
[02:37:23.291 --> 02:37:28.893]  They had a New York Times article a few years ago of a former, quote, employee who I guess was a desperate writer and they made a deal with him in painting.
[02:37:29.433 --> 02:37:34.734]  They said that I walked into someone at the office and grabbed a fish out of their bowl and ate it.
[02:37:35.955 --> 02:37:37.535]  I mean, that's from Wolf of Wall Street.
[02:37:38.135 --> 02:37:42.637]  And that the fish was going to be given to their niece, which is Finding Nemo.
[02:37:43.037 --> 02:37:45.677]  So yeah, it was like plagiarism on steroids.
[02:37:45.837 --> 02:37:47.698]  So it's funny, you're right, it's the it thing.
[02:37:47.958 --> 02:37:56.020]  So they don't even... They're not consciously aware of this, but they are sketching out these fantasies based on movies they've seen recently.
[02:37:56.500 --> 02:38:00.461]  It just had a big two-part lavish redo in the movies.
[02:38:00.821 --> 02:38:01.962]  This is the plot of this.
[02:38:01.982 --> 02:38:02.822]  Wow, you're smart, Milo.
[02:38:02.842 --> 02:38:03.502]  I didn't understand.
[02:38:03.622 --> 02:38:03.922]  Wow.
[02:38:04.222 --> 02:38:04.662]  So look at it.
[02:38:04.702 --> 02:38:05.482]  I'm going to cover it now.
[02:38:05.723 --> 02:38:06.503]  Let's do the next segment.
[02:38:06.523 --> 02:38:07.563]  Look at this.
[02:38:07.583 --> 02:38:08.063]  Look at this.
[02:38:08.083 --> 02:38:09.764]  Megaphone for conspiracy.
[02:38:10.424 --> 02:38:11.284]  Now, now, now, now.
[02:38:12.369 --> 02:38:13.630]  How do I know what's in it?
[02:38:14.131 --> 02:38:15.512]  They sent me this!
[02:38:15.592 --> 02:38:16.133]  Look at this!
[02:38:16.213 --> 02:38:18.014]  Look at this!
[02:38:18.355 --> 02:38:28.704]  It says I'm a criminal that attacked on January 6th, then it says I beat all these people up and nerds tied me up and knocked my teeth out, and they're asking me to respond to this!
[02:38:28.904 --> 02:38:31.066]  Next time he calls you, you gotta figure out, hello Georgie!
[02:38:32.955 --> 02:38:33.955]  I'm not over here, Georgie.
[02:38:33.975 --> 02:38:34.676]  You want a balloon?
[02:38:34.996 --> 02:38:38.357]  I like the 1980s when we was like, oh, how you doing, Georgie?
[02:38:38.457 --> 02:38:39.518]  And bites his arm off.
[02:38:39.838 --> 02:38:40.658]  Hello, Georgie.
[02:38:40.858 --> 02:38:41.579]  Yes, it's true.
[02:38:42.059 --> 02:38:47.981]  I hide in gutters and bite children's arms off.
[02:38:50.382 --> 02:38:52.763]  But meanwhile, the truth is way cooler.
[02:38:52.863 --> 02:38:54.484]  This is your media, America.
[02:38:54.744 --> 02:38:55.044]  Oh, yeah.
[02:38:55.064 --> 02:38:56.965]  Here's Alex Jones, folks.
[02:38:57.125 --> 02:38:58.325]  Your prestige media.
[02:38:58.345 --> 02:38:59.386]  This is real footage, CNN.
[02:39:03.762 --> 02:39:05.244]  We laugh about it, there I am.
[02:39:05.284 --> 02:39:06.084]  Look, it's Alex Jones!
[02:39:06.124 --> 02:39:07.826]  That's me in high school.
[02:39:07.906 --> 02:39:08.506]  You want a balloon?
[02:39:08.726 --> 02:39:10.107]  I went to the elementary school.
[02:39:10.128 --> 02:39:11.048]  Want a balloon?
[02:39:11.449 --> 02:39:12.710]  I went to the elementary school.
[02:39:12.750 --> 02:39:14.191]  We all float down here.
[02:39:14.211 --> 02:39:16.713]  I don't know how Ryan Stelter got this roll footage made.
[02:39:17.994 --> 02:39:19.315]  We all float down here.
[02:39:19.335 --> 02:39:19.975]  No, put it back up!
[02:39:20.236 --> 02:39:22.818]  We want to know what happens.
[02:39:23.198 --> 02:39:27.181]  Oh, there's clowns and horses.
[02:39:27.281 --> 02:39:27.962]  Bears and...
[02:39:28.789 --> 02:39:31.050]  Hey Georgie, you're gonna love it, come on down here.
[02:39:32.271 --> 02:39:41.495]  So again, the left's bullying, they're taking our speech, they're taking our bank accounts, they're putting us in prison, and then the answer is, I'm... Pennywise.
[02:39:42.455 --> 02:39:43.515]  Well, where's the arrest?
[02:39:43.616 --> 02:39:45.616]  Where's the dental records?
[02:39:45.957 --> 02:39:52.740]  Where's the... The one true thing in here is, a guy that was mad that I dated his girlfriend, which I hadn't even done, she...
[02:39:54.099 --> 02:39:59.841]  Combson is like a senior at the high school and comes to the door and says, I need to go to the principal's office.
[02:40:00.842 --> 02:40:02.783]  And then he starts punching me in the hallway.
[02:40:02.843 --> 02:40:04.303]  So I kick his ass.
[02:40:04.343 --> 02:40:06.364]  He falls over, hits his head on the concrete floor.
[02:40:06.744 --> 02:40:10.326]  And then the police didn't arrest me because they had surveillance cameras.
[02:40:10.646 --> 02:40:13.287]  So the point is, is that I'm like assaulting people out of the blue.
[02:40:13.547 --> 02:40:14.928]  Where's the arrest?
[02:40:15.388 --> 02:40:16.168]  Where is it?
[02:40:16.348 --> 02:40:17.789]  The only thing in there is that.
[02:40:18.129 --> 02:40:20.031]  I liked the humble brag you did earlier, by the way.
[02:40:20.071 --> 02:40:22.194]  You said, and the guy did end up in a coma.
[02:40:23.215 --> 02:40:24.857]  He started it, you know.
[02:40:24.877 --> 02:40:26.319]  No, I felt bad about it.
[02:40:26.339 --> 02:40:27.600]  He got better, he got better.
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:31.124]  But the point was, the point was, is that, is that, that happened.
[02:40:31.585 --> 02:40:32.506]  And that's what went on.
[02:40:32.806 --> 02:40:36.371]  But the dude was bigger than me, which is a big, be bigger than me and stuff.
[02:40:36.391 --> 02:40:37.292]  That's when you get the problem.
[02:40:38.693 --> 02:40:44.615]  I won't say the word out loud because it's a family show, but there's that expression the Proud Boys use, F around and find out.
[02:40:44.735 --> 02:40:46.436]  If you start it, you get what's coming.
[02:40:46.456 --> 02:40:54.459]  Well the point is, if he throws punches at you and ends up, as you so humbly said, in a coma, you get what you get.
[02:40:54.519 --> 02:40:57.740]  If you start a fight with somebody, if you start punching somebody, out of nowhere you get what you get.
[02:40:58.201 --> 02:41:03.803]  Well I feel bad for that person, they're being used as a pawn in this, but that's the only thing in the questions that has any truth.
[02:41:04.383 --> 02:41:06.647]  But then it's like, you just attacked someone for no reason.
[02:41:06.827 --> 02:41:07.588]  Where's the arrest?
[02:41:07.949 --> 02:41:12.376]  Where's the... No, it doesn't exist because it didn't happen the way they say.
[02:41:12.677 --> 02:41:16.483]  And the idea that I'm walking around like, hey, there's a homeless person.
[02:41:16.523 --> 02:41:17.405]  Let me go beat them up.
[02:41:19.036 --> 02:41:29.181]  I think what we need, Alex, is I think we need to see you in the dentist's chair, you know, full 360, like the Matrix cameras, you know, where you can go around in real time.
[02:41:29.281 --> 02:41:30.162]  Actually, I'm going to do that.
[02:41:30.222 --> 02:41:33.944]  I think we need the full dental 3D reconstruction.
[02:41:34.224 --> 02:41:35.185]  Maybe you could have it on the website.
[02:41:35.205 --> 02:41:36.045]  People can zoom in.
[02:41:36.306 --> 02:41:37.646]  They can see where your fillings are.
[02:41:37.666 --> 02:41:40.788]  They can see which... No, no, actually, I'm doing this.
[02:41:40.848 --> 02:41:41.248]  I'm waiting.
[02:41:41.328 --> 02:41:41.889]  I want a 3D model.
[02:41:41.949 --> 02:41:42.529]  I'm going to sew them.
[02:41:42.569 --> 02:41:43.730]  When are you going to buy a house?
[02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:51.294]   Because when they made these claims three years ago, I hadn't had an implant over here, one of the molars finally cracked on it, but I got... You can see her teeth have been broken off, that's, you know.
[02:41:51.434 --> 02:41:51.554]  Right.
[02:41:51.574 --> 02:41:53.954]  I'm gonna have forensic experts, everything, because they're mine!
[02:41:54.155 --> 02:41:54.875]  I think we need this.
[02:41:55.215 --> 02:41:57.976]  But this is how they steal your identity.
[02:41:58.196 --> 02:42:01.477]  So you have the leftist nerds that have become the bullies.
[02:42:02.575 --> 02:42:08.942]  All they want to do is project on who they're censoring, trying to imprison, enslave, and lying about it, de-platforming as the bullies.
[02:42:09.022 --> 02:42:18.512]  Milo's got great psycho analysis on this, but CNN has a special show as they sink into the oblivion of fake news Sunday.
[02:42:19.321 --> 02:42:20.542]  And they're like, you're a criminal.
[02:42:20.602 --> 02:42:21.463]  You led the attack.
[02:42:21.563 --> 02:42:22.563]  Answer our questions.
[02:42:23.364 --> 02:42:25.706]  You know, your teeth got knocked out.
[02:42:26.526 --> 02:42:29.769]  Because I already know the story from John Ronson, who's just writing a movie.
[02:42:30.129 --> 02:42:31.070]  He's shopping around.
[02:42:31.550 --> 02:42:32.431]  None of it's real.
[02:42:33.920 --> 02:42:35.882]  And then he goes through all these lists.
[02:42:35.902 --> 02:42:37.043]  So you've been a newspaper guy.
[02:42:37.063 --> 02:42:39.605]  You've been a journalist before you became a pundit.
[02:42:40.045 --> 02:42:40.686]  You read this.
[02:42:40.886 --> 02:42:42.047]  What do you make of this?
[02:42:42.067 --> 02:42:43.008]  You had a great analysis.
[02:42:43.368 --> 02:42:44.269]  I read the questions.
[02:42:44.729 --> 02:42:48.012]  And the thing that strikes me about, I mean, they could have made up any number of things.
[02:42:48.032 --> 02:42:49.574]  They could make up financial malfeasance.
[02:42:49.614 --> 02:42:51.956]  They could make up whatever they want.
[02:42:52.016 --> 02:42:54.518]  But they're going in hard on physical violence.
[02:42:54.718 --> 02:42:57.020]  It occurs to me this is for one of two reasons.
[02:42:57.540 --> 02:43:03.424]  The first is that women involved in stuff like this have never been hit, but they think it's the worst thing that will ever happen to them because they've never been in a fight.
[02:43:04.225 --> 02:43:08.148]  And they don't know what it's like and they think that it's... They don't know it's actually invigorating.
[02:43:08.268 --> 02:43:12.871]  They don't know that sometimes... Well, I don't like getting hit, but once it starts, it's, you know... Well, so people tell me.
[02:43:13.531 --> 02:43:16.253]  And the other worse dimension of this is the men.
[02:43:16.514 --> 02:43:23.439]  The weedy, soy-fed, cringey, five-foot-two little nerds.
[02:43:24.159 --> 02:43:33.528]  For whom either they're remembering being beaten up in the playground and they want revenge on the bullies who beat them up, the popular successful athletic kids, and it is just Revenge of the Nerds, it's it.
[02:43:34.409 --> 02:43:40.334]  Or they've never been in a fight because of how and who and what they are, because they're probably rich kids and went to a nice school.
[02:43:40.394 --> 02:43:40.935]  Exactly.
[02:43:41.135 --> 02:43:41.355]  But...
[02:43:42.316 --> 02:43:46.520]  For them, the idea of getting punched in the face is probably the worst thing they can ever imagine.
[02:43:46.860 --> 02:43:57.150]  Because they know that of all of the things that they're inadequate at, they're inadequate at sex, they're inadequate at their job, they're inadequate at all the rest of it, they are most inadequate physically in terms of being a man and being an imposing presence.
[02:43:57.490 --> 02:44:01.214]  They are terrified, they are petrified of nothing more than physical violence.
[02:44:01.534 --> 02:44:06.058]  Which is why they always claim falsely that January 6th was incredibly violent when it wasn't.
[02:44:06.398 --> 02:44:07.860]  Why they always, you know, do this, that and the other.
[02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:11.363]  Why have they invented this stuff about you, about physical violence?
[02:44:11.403 --> 02:44:13.444]  Because it's what frightens them the most.
[02:44:13.924 --> 02:44:18.828]  And that's why, you know, you can hear people on PBS and NPR and all these others.
[02:44:18.868 --> 02:44:24.913]  You were telling me, you know, it's very concerned as though this was... Oh, when they interviewed me, it was taped.
[02:44:24.933 --> 02:44:28.676]  They're like, they bound you and knocked your teeth out, didn't they?
[02:44:30.464 --> 02:44:31.846]  I'm sorry, Alex.
[02:44:32.186 --> 02:44:33.267]  I'm sorry that happened.
[02:44:33.608 --> 02:44:40.416]  And they're trying... It's like, whatever their fantasy is, they want you to buy into their lie, so they can make a movie about you and steal your identity.
[02:44:40.436 --> 02:44:41.337]  No, John Ronson!
[02:44:41.637 --> 02:44:42.478]  It doesn't happen!
[02:44:42.799 --> 02:44:43.860]  Who would play you?
[02:44:44.100 --> 02:44:48.586]  I'm gonna set a trust up with lawsuits, even if they put me in prison or kill me, where he gets sued when they put this out.
[02:44:49.106 --> 02:44:51.169]  Who would play you in the movie?
[02:44:51.669 --> 02:44:53.111]  Well, I actually know all about John Ronson.
[02:44:53.431 --> 02:44:56.134]  He comes to me and he says, I'm afraid to be sued.
[02:44:56.535 --> 02:45:00.079]  I want you to sign an agreement that you'll sneak into Bohemian Grove and give me the footage.
[02:45:00.419 --> 02:45:01.481]  I want you to put it out.
[02:45:01.961 --> 02:45:06.887]  And once you don't get sued, Harry Shearer is going to make a major motion picture about this.
[02:45:07.868 --> 02:45:09.009]  And then I confirmed it all.
[02:45:09.670 --> 02:45:15.110]   I sneak in, I give him the footage, he waits three years, comes out, attacks me, says he
[02:45:15.110 --> 02:45:20.949]   actually snuck in, which he did with me and Mike Hanson, then says I'm a liar and that
[02:45:20.949 --> 02:45:24.969]   I stole all the glory when I signed a contract to not talk about it, then Harry Shearer makes
[02:45:24.969 --> 02:45:26.909]  a documentary about it.
[02:45:26.909 --> 02:45:32.509]   I mean, dude, where do you come up with a crazy schizo brain like that?
[02:45:32.526 --> 02:45:34.047]  I mean, who are these people?
[02:45:34.328 --> 02:45:35.489]  You hired me!
[02:45:35.749 --> 02:45:38.492]  You paid me money to sneak in the damn place.
[02:45:38.813 --> 02:45:39.914]  I had the balls to do it.
[02:45:40.214 --> 02:45:41.556]  The ritual got on tape.
[02:45:41.796 --> 02:45:42.737]  You got the footage.
[02:45:43.017 --> 02:45:47.522]  And then now you try to steal my identity later and claim I'm knocking children's...
[02:45:48.203 --> 02:45:48.803]  Brains out?
[02:45:48.884 --> 02:45:54.067]  I mean, it's just... And then I learned from Hollywood, they call me, they go, yeah, Jones, this is like major producers.
[02:45:54.327 --> 02:45:57.829]  Yeah, John Ronson shopping the story about you beating up nerds.
[02:45:57.849 --> 02:45:58.850]  Funny, you said Revenge of the Nerds.
[02:45:58.870 --> 02:46:00.791]  They said, it's Revenge of the Nerds Part 5.
[02:46:01.852 --> 02:46:02.593]  They said that.
[02:46:02.893 --> 02:46:04.814]  I mean, he doesn't even know I'm getting the calls.
[02:46:05.054 --> 02:46:07.196]  He's going around like lying about this stuff.
[02:46:08.417 --> 02:46:09.697]  Which again, he's doing it again.
[02:46:10.938 --> 02:46:13.500]  He didn't want to put the Bohemian Grove footage out and get the heat.
[02:46:14.466 --> 02:46:17.809]  He let me do it, then put his TV show and movie out.
[02:46:17.889 --> 02:46:18.790]  And it's the same thing.
[02:46:19.131 --> 02:46:26.557]  Now he's having NPR, CNN put out fake reports, and then off that, Leonardo DiCaprio can play Alex Jones the devil.
[02:46:26.958 --> 02:46:28.319]  I think it would be DiCaprio, wouldn't it?
[02:46:28.479 --> 02:46:31.222]  No, that's who they've optioned it, I'm told.
[02:46:34.696 --> 02:46:35.236]  No, it's not.
[02:46:35.256 --> 02:46:35.976]  You can't make this up.
[02:46:35.996 --> 02:46:40.298]  And the reason they want him is because he played a slave owner in, uh, you know, a little while ago.
[02:46:40.338 --> 02:46:44.579]  And like, where he's the fake airline pilot, and where he's the Wolf of Wall Street.
[02:46:44.659 --> 02:46:50.961]  Yeah, so he's, when people see him as Alex Jones, they're gonna have all of that emotional baggage from seeing him play all these villains.
[02:46:51.201 --> 02:46:53.821]  And I was even told people, well, don't torpedo this, that'll be kind of cool.
[02:46:53.861 --> 02:46:57.382]  No, I don't want Leonardo DiCaprio playing me as the devil, okay?
[02:46:57.662 --> 02:46:59.263]  And I'm just on record saying it ain't true.
[02:46:59.963 --> 02:47:05.065]  Look, not to go all God Squad on it, but as... I don't think anyone buys into me actually beating up weak people.
[02:47:05.105 --> 02:47:05.765]  No, I don't think so.
[02:47:05.785 --> 02:47:14.008]  But what you're describing, the behavior you're describing, which, you know, I overuse this word chutzpah a lot, but what you're describing is a life without Christ, right?
[02:47:14.028 --> 02:47:16.089]  You're describing godless people.
[02:47:16.149 --> 02:47:18.270]  You say, how can people behave like this?
[02:47:18.550 --> 02:47:19.410]  How can they do this?
[02:47:19.690 --> 02:47:22.051]  How can they be this way?
[02:47:22.091 --> 02:47:26.433]  How can they sign a deal with me in good faith and then turn on me and then present me as whatever?
[02:47:26.473 --> 02:47:29.274]  Well, this is how people behave when they don't have Jesus Christ in their lives.
[02:47:29.634 --> 02:47:30.315]  It's true.
[02:47:30.576 --> 02:47:31.537]  That's how they behave.
[02:47:31.697 --> 02:47:33.019]  I was bad before I got Jesus.
[02:47:33.139 --> 02:47:42.372]  That's what people are like before they get Jesus Christ in their lives and that's why you should try to do business with Christians and why you should try to hang out with Christians.
[02:47:42.412 --> 02:47:42.973]  Real Christians.
[02:47:43.013 --> 02:47:49.322]   Why you should try to seek out in your private life Certainly in your marriage and in all other aspects of life.
[02:47:49.882 --> 02:47:54.068]  The best way to determine whether somebody is going to treat you well and do right by you.
[02:47:54.088 --> 02:47:59.014]  Exactly, because I want to make deals with people and do it over and over again and be secure.
[02:47:59.294 --> 02:48:01.137]  They want to F you every time.
[02:48:01.377 --> 02:48:03.739]  And then move on to another target.
[02:48:03.799 --> 02:48:07.703]  But the best way to determine if somebody is going to do right by you, it's not if they're black or white.
[02:48:07.784 --> 02:48:09.105]  It's not even if they're gay or straight.
[02:48:09.145 --> 02:48:10.106]  It's not if they're a man or woman.
[02:48:10.206 --> 02:48:11.768]  It is, does that guy go to church?
[02:48:12.008 --> 02:48:14.931]  Is he a true God-fearing, church-going Christian?
[02:48:15.111 --> 02:48:16.633]  Oh, I mean, John Ronson is like...
[02:48:17.253 --> 02:48:19.437]  The most weak, demonic creature you can imagine.
[02:48:19.497 --> 02:48:20.999]  He, like Ursula, sucked his soul.
[02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:24.424]  But now I can look back... I can look... Those little things?
[02:48:24.484 --> 02:48:27.409]  Yeah, the thing at the bottom.
[02:48:27.489 --> 02:48:32.296]  And they want to silence me, steal my identity, and then have me beating up nerds.
[02:48:32.697 --> 02:48:33.818]  This is your life without Christ.
[02:48:34.078 --> 02:48:35.920]  This is what people are prepared to do.
[02:48:36.380 --> 02:48:42.366]  How dark and deep and dank and miserable they are prepared to make their conduct.
[02:48:42.887 --> 02:48:44.648]  Because for them, it doesn't matter.
[02:48:44.788 --> 02:48:47.587]  For them, there's no great consequence in the next life.
[02:48:47.587 --> 02:48:48.667]  Look at that predator.
[02:48:48.667 --> 02:48:50.426]  And let's just land on this.
[02:48:50.426 --> 02:48:51.506]  Look at him, look at him.
[02:48:51.506 --> 02:48:54.507]   He's not worried about what's gonna happen to him after he dies.
[02:48:54.507 --> 02:48:57.667]   He's not worried about heaven and hell because he doesn't believe in it.
[02:48:57.667 --> 02:49:02.788]   All he's worried about is grasping here and now and this plane on this earth.
[02:49:02.788 --> 02:49:06.346]  And you can't trust people who don't have big--
[02:49:06.346 --> 02:49:08.068]  All I know is he's a damn liar.
[02:49:08.068 --> 02:49:11.388]   I got beat up a lot when I was a kid and I decided to not be a victim.
[02:49:11.388 --> 02:49:13.147]  I became an overcomer.
[02:49:13.147 --> 02:49:15.948]  And I've always fought big powerful groups.
[02:49:15.728 --> 02:49:15.908]  Yes.
[02:49:16.269 --> 02:49:20.412]  I've made a few mistakes covering other people that were hitting small groups, and never punched down.
[02:49:20.492 --> 02:49:25.657]  But you have a sense of the scale of the problems, and you have... Yeah, they want me to be this guy, and I'm not!
[02:49:25.677 --> 02:49:28.599]  I was the guy being hung over the balcony!
[02:49:28.619 --> 02:49:39.608]  I think the reason people like you so much, Alex, you know, is that you have a sense of the scale of the problem, and the vastness of the gap between good and evil, right?
[02:49:39.949 --> 02:49:45.172]   You know instinctively What good looks and feels like, and you know what evil looks and feels like.
[02:49:45.212 --> 02:50:01.381]  So even before everything has tumbled out, the reason people say Alex Jones was right, the reason people have this thing, you know, sort of, oh Alex Jones said this years ago, is because even before you know everything, your intuition is so often so perfect about people, because you know what evil looks like.
[02:50:01.581 --> 02:50:02.021]  Exactly.
[02:50:02.381 --> 02:50:03.182]  That's a God thing.
[02:50:03.282 --> 02:50:04.162]  That's true though.
[02:50:04.502 --> 02:50:05.303]  My mother said that.
[02:50:05.963 --> 02:50:06.844]  We were at dinner like two weeks ago.
[02:50:06.864 --> 02:50:07.744]  She goes, it's all God.
[02:50:07.784 --> 02:50:08.004]  It is.
[02:50:08.084 --> 02:50:08.905]  It's God's discernment.
[02:50:08.925 --> 02:50:09.305]  It's not me.
[02:50:09.785 --> 02:50:16.871]  Exactly, but this is, you know, whatever you want to call it, the Holy Spirit working through you, however you want to phrase it, you have the right intuition about things.
[02:50:17.312 --> 02:50:24.258]  So, you know, the iconic example is the frogs, but you do it over and over and over again, Alex, because you allow Him to work through you in that way.
[02:50:24.938 --> 02:50:33.466]  These people, on the other hand, these slippery, slimy... They could be so successful they just didn't betray, but they're of their Father the Devil, they can't help it!
[02:50:33.766 --> 02:50:33.906]  Yes.
[02:50:34.026 --> 02:50:40.351]  Because they don't want any... It's like in the great movie, There Will Be Blood, which is a novel based on composites, real stuff.
[02:50:40.711 --> 02:50:42.473]  He says, I have a competitiveness in me.
[02:50:42.493 --> 02:50:44.254]  I don't want anyone else to do well.
[02:50:44.754 --> 02:50:45.435]  That's not good.
[02:50:45.655 --> 02:50:52.220]  And that's very much like a lot of the conservative, supposedly conservative, figureheads who are instrumental in making our life difficult.
[02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:53.161]  People like Ben Shapiro.
[02:50:53.521 --> 02:50:56.323]  They take the same view that life is a zero-sum game.
[02:50:56.443 --> 02:50:58.485]  If someone is succeeding, I must be failing.
[02:50:58.865 --> 02:51:02.348]  They don't realize that a rising tide, you know, raises all... Kelly's right.
[02:51:02.448 --> 02:51:19.682]   They don't realize that the The better we all do, the better everybody does, because even if you had a lobotomy or something and you think that Ben Shapiro is the ideal conservatism, the world he wants to build isn't great, but it's at least better than the one that the guys on MSNBC want.
[02:51:20.362 --> 02:51:20.742]  Exactly.
[02:51:20.762 --> 02:51:22.202]  They want to lower everybody so we're equal.
[02:51:22.223 --> 02:51:24.263]  And if we're all pushing in roughly the same direction, that's good.
[02:51:24.523 --> 02:51:30.525]  But people like Shapiro, people, you know, people who, basically, any conservative who still has a Twitter account, that's your clue.
[02:51:31.165 --> 02:51:33.945]  These people believe that if you're succeeding, they must be failing.
[02:51:33.985 --> 02:51:44.568]  So they have to take you out because they think there's a total addressable market that's here, and if anybody else gets any viewers whatsoever, you're stealing what was rightfully theirs, and that is a demonic point of view.
[02:51:44.668 --> 02:51:46.889]  That zero-sum game thing, that's a demonic point of view.
[02:51:46.929 --> 02:51:47.109]  I agree.
[02:51:47.129 --> 02:51:47.549]  We want 360 wins.
[02:51:48.769 --> 02:51:49.029]  Yes.
[02:51:49.369 --> 02:51:49.590]  Yes.
[02:51:49.690 --> 02:51:51.911]  Milo Yiannopoulos is born again.
[02:51:52.672 --> 02:51:56.295]  Super hardcore from this to now what he is today.
[02:51:56.335 --> 02:51:59.257]  And I say you were powerful then, but you're even more powerful now.
[02:51:59.617 --> 02:52:00.638]  That was somebody else.
[02:52:01.478 --> 02:52:02.039]  All right, brother.
[02:52:02.059 --> 02:52:03.019]  We appreciate you, man.
[02:52:03.099 --> 02:52:03.580]  God bless you, man.
[02:52:03.920 --> 02:52:04.220]  All right.
[02:52:04.300 --> 02:52:08.503]  Owen Troyer comes up on the Forbidden Info Wars right now.
[02:52:08.604 --> 02:52:08.864]  Wow.
[02:52:09.004 --> 02:52:09.744]  What a broadcast.
[02:52:09.764 --> 02:52:10.665]  Great job of the crew.
[02:52:11.165 --> 02:52:12.787]  Lord willing, we'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:52:12.827 --> 02:52:13.167]  Central.
[02:52:13.948 --> 02:52:17.577]  And don't forget, Harrison Smith, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[02:52:17.436 --> 02:52:20.596]  I'm Jim Central with American Journal.
[02:52:20.596 --> 02:52:23.355]  (dramatic music)
[02:52:23.355 --> 02:52:26.115]  (dramatic music)
[02:52:27.115 --> 02:52:34.236]   You are insane if you are not supplementing vitamin D3 and vitamin K in your life.
[02:52:34.533 --> 02:52:35.654]  That's not my opinion.
[02:52:36.214 --> 02:52:48.108]   If you look at the facts, you are crazy if you're not taking it at least several times a week, especially if you've got darker skin and aren't getting a bunch of sun.
[02:52:48.108 --> 02:52:53.967]   Just look into vitamin D3 and folks that have more melanin in their skin and the fact that that blocks the sun
[02:52:53.967 --> 02:52:56.667]  and then your body can't produce it naturally.
[02:52:56.667 --> 02:52:59.148]  The best place to get it is naturally from the sun.
[02:52:59.148 --> 02:53:05.067]   The second best place is by ingesting it and the best way to do that is under the tongue
[02:53:05.067 --> 02:53:08.787]  into the blood vessels so it goes directly in the blood.
[02:53:08.787 --> 02:53:12.427]   And that's how you take winter sun is sublingually under the tongue.
[02:53:12.427 --> 02:53:16.867]   Now this is a high-end, organic, bioavailable vitamin D3.
[02:53:16.867 --> 02:53:23.826]   And then on top of it, it has a high-quality vitamin K because the two work in synergy,
[02:53:23.826 --> 02:53:28.747]   not just for your immune system, but every major function in the body.
[02:53:28.747 --> 02:53:32.467]   And when I forget sometimes to take it for a week, I feel it, I notice it.
[02:53:32.467 --> 02:53:36.747]   I religiously now henpeck my dad and call him every couple days
[02:53:36.747 --> 02:53:38.186]  and make sure he's taking it.
[02:53:38.186 --> 02:53:41.587]   I go over to his house every couple of weeks and check that the bottles are going down.
[02:53:41.587 --> 02:53:46.747]   And since he's been doing it for six months, it has been miraculous he looks 10 years younger.
[02:53:46.747 --> 02:53:52.266]   Ladies and gentlemen, I am religiously now taking it every morning, a couple drops out of the tongue.
[02:53:52.266 --> 02:53:57.788]   It's great for children, it's great for adults, it is extremely critical for older people
[02:53:57.788 --> 02:53:59.627]  and again, folks with brown skin.
[02:53:59.964 --> 02:54:13.677]  If you've got brown skin or you've got dark brown skin, you better listen to me and research this, because the system isn't telling you why black folks out there are dropping dead in such massive numbers, but we are here talking about it.
[02:54:13.997 --> 02:54:17.120]  The number one issue is vitamin D3.
[02:54:17.240 --> 02:54:18.781]  You must have it to live.
[02:54:19.101 --> 02:54:23.261]   Wherever you get it, get your vitamin D. We have a high quality source, back in stock,
[02:54:23.261 --> 02:54:37.221]  50% off, winter sun, Infowarsstore.com.
[02:54:37.221 --> 02:54:41.541]  You're looking at Infowars' newest designer t-shirt.
[02:54:42.376 --> 02:54:44.459]  It's the Presidential Emoji shirt!
[02:54:45.325 --> 02:54:52.909]  And it's got all 46 presidents going back to the founding of this nation with George Washington.
[02:54:53.469 --> 02:54:56.831]  And it ends up with Obama, Trump and Biden.
[02:54:57.411 --> 02:54:58.852]  And of course, Biden is a clown.
[02:54:59.332 --> 02:55:05.295]  Trump's wearing the sunglasses and we know that Barack Obama is not a good friend of America.
[02:55:05.775 --> 02:55:07.436]  This shirt is very thought provoking.
[02:55:07.536 --> 02:55:09.017]  It'll cause a lot of conversations.
[02:55:09.597 --> 02:55:11.800]  It's a great way to wake people up.
[02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:13.523]  It also makes a great gift.
[02:55:13.543 --> 02:55:17.668]  You're not just giving someone the gift of a fun t-shirt when you give them this.
[02:55:18.916 --> 02:55:30.129]  You're also funding the information war and there are dozens and dozens and dozens of new t-shirts that we've designed in the last six months that are now available at infowarestore.com.
[02:55:30.489 --> 02:55:36.656]  And when you purchase the shirt, you're giving yourself the gift of waking up the world and living in a free society.
[02:55:36.997 --> 02:55:39.980]  So get one for yourself and give one as a gift.
[02:55:40.380 --> 02:55:53.065]  All of it is a 360 win and it keeps us on the air while the Democrats and the Deep State and the Demos Group and Klaus Schwab and the Globalists are fighting around the clock to shut us down because they can't succeed if we stay on the air.
[02:55:53.766 --> 02:55:59.528]  And of course we have a whole line of amazing 1776 shirts in short sleeve and long sleeve.
[02:55:59.868 --> 02:56:01.689]  And then of course there's one of my favorites.
[02:56:02.209 --> 02:56:05.110]  The Vaccine Passport T-shirt.
[02:56:05.571 --> 02:56:08.712]  This lets the Globalists know you're not signing on to their Mark of the Beast.
[02:56:09.232 --> 02:56:14.918]  You're fully aware of what they're doing and you're educating other sheeple at the same time while funding the M4 War.
[02:56:15.278 --> 02:56:16.539]  A true 360 win.
[02:56:16.940 --> 02:56:21.684]  Get yours now with hundreds of other amazing t-shirts to choose from at m4warestore.com.
[02:56:22.125 --> 02:56:26.108]  All of this art is original and it's incredibly thought-provoking like this one.
[02:56:26.869 --> 02:56:30.811]  You've got one mouse asking the other mouse, are you going to take the vaccine?
[02:56:31.331 --> 02:56:32.151]  He says, no way.
[02:56:32.571 --> 02:56:35.053]  They haven't even finished the human trials yet.
[02:56:35.793 --> 02:56:39.074]  These are the type of shirts you'll find exclusively at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:56:39.374 --> 02:56:42.016]  Again, hundreds and hundreds of shirts to choose from.
[02:56:42.436 --> 02:56:45.997]  Dozens and dozens of new shirts that we just produced in the last few months.
[02:56:46.057 --> 02:56:48.178]  And it funds the InfoWar, and it spreads the word.
[02:56:48.258 --> 02:56:51.420]  Like this one, which is mainly for Texans, but other folks might want one.
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.161]  Most likely to secede.
[02:56:54.941 --> 02:57:01.846]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com, and it keeps us on air, and it exercises free speech in the public, something the left doesn't want.
[02:57:02.247 --> 02:57:06.310]  So again, thanks for keeping us on the air, and thanks for shopping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:57:06.330 --> 02:57:21.922]  I want to salute and thank you all for your support, and I want to encourage you to go and get these t-shirts and other pieces of apparel and wear them openly, loudly, and proudly, and let the leftists know they're never going to silence us, they're never going to break our will, and we are going to take America and the world back.
