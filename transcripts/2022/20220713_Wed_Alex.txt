[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  It's Wednesday, July 13th, 2022.
[00:15.000 --> 00:16.500]  Infowars.
[00:16.500 --> 00:41.500]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:41.500 --> 00:56.500]  Riders on the storm.
[00:56.500 --> 01:01.500]  Riders on the storm.
[01:01.500 --> 01:05.500]  Riders on the storm.
[01:05.500 --> 01:10.500]  Into this house we're born.
[01:10.500 --> 01:14.500]  Into this world we're thrown.
[01:14.500 --> 01:17.500]  Like a dog without a bone.
[01:17.500 --> 01:20.500]  And a factor out of love.
[01:20.500 --> 01:24.500]  Riders on the storm.
[01:24.500 --> 01:28.500]  There's a killer on the road.
[01:28.500 --> 01:34.500]  His brain is squirming like a toad.
[01:34.500 --> 01:39.500]  Take a long holiday.
[01:39.500 --> 01:42.500]  Let your children play.
[01:42.500 --> 01:46.500]  Well, all of our broadcasts are critical and powerful,
[01:46.500 --> 01:48.500]  but today's a particularly important.
[01:48.500 --> 01:54.500]  Man, is it all going down.
[01:54.500 --> 01:56.500]  Absolutely insane.
[01:56.500 --> 02:00.500]  You know, I wouldn't cover the January 6th fiasco,
[02:00.500 --> 02:03.500]  the January 6th show trial,
[02:03.500 --> 02:05.500]  that they're claiming as a court of law,
[02:05.500 --> 02:07.500]  just because I've been attacked in it a bunch.
[02:07.500 --> 02:09.500]  That's quite frankly, it's boring.
[02:09.500 --> 02:12.500]  But when you realize that the entire deep state agenda
[02:12.500 --> 02:15.500]  is about criminalizing Trump running again for office
[02:15.500 --> 02:18.500]  and criminalizing the grassroots populist movement
[02:18.500 --> 02:19.500]  that brought him to power,
[02:19.500 --> 02:22.500]  then you understand it's key to what they're doing.
[02:22.500 --> 02:26.500]  Now, we have the ratings last week and this week on it,
[02:26.500 --> 02:27.500]  and they're flatlined.
[02:27.500 --> 02:29.500]  Actually, I actually have the ratings.
[02:29.500 --> 02:31.500]  It's called flatlining.
[02:31.500 --> 02:32.500]  No one is watching.
[02:32.500 --> 02:33.500]  No one.
[02:33.500 --> 02:37.500]  I mean, we're talking all networks combined,
[02:37.500 --> 02:39.500]  a couple hundred thousand people a day.
[02:39.500 --> 02:43.500]  Now, by contrast on WABC in New York,
[02:43.500 --> 02:46.500]  popular daily talk shows,
[02:46.500 --> 02:51.500]  some of them have upwards of a million listeners a day
[02:51.500 --> 02:53.500]  on a marquee station like that.
[02:53.500 --> 02:57.500]  One radio station has more listeners
[02:57.500 --> 02:59.500]  than these people have viewers in a whole week.
[02:59.500 --> 03:03.500]  They joke, except they have power.
[03:03.500 --> 03:05.500]  And I got a bunch of Google search trends here.
[03:05.500 --> 03:06.500]  Look at this one for TV viewers.
[03:06.500 --> 03:07.500]  You can see it on the screen.
[03:07.500 --> 03:08.500]  I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[03:08.500 --> 03:09.500]  RNC Research put this out.
[03:09.500 --> 03:14.500]  Here is a Google Trends comparison for searches
[03:14.500 --> 03:17.500]  over the last day on topics of January 6,
[03:17.500 --> 03:20.500]  all topics of January 6 combined,
[03:20.500 --> 03:24.500]  and just Jill Biden tacos.
[03:24.500 --> 03:29.500]  It is over a hundred times the searches
[03:29.500 --> 03:34.500]  for Jill Biden tacos that it is for January 6,
[03:34.500 --> 03:37.500]  and it's always flatlined.
[03:37.500 --> 03:42.500]  100 times the searches for Jill Biden tacos
[03:42.500 --> 03:45.500]  than their entire show trial,
[03:45.500 --> 03:49.500]  their entire big budget production of edited tapes
[03:49.500 --> 03:56.500]  and junk cuts and fake people testifying.
[03:56.500 --> 03:59.500]  They've got oath keepers who've done plea deals
[03:59.500 --> 04:02.500]  and are waiting for sentencing in September,
[04:02.500 --> 04:06.500]  and if they don't go say whatever is demanded of them,
[04:06.500 --> 04:07.500]  then they'll be put in prison.
[04:07.500 --> 04:10.500]  I mean, that's illegal.
[04:10.500 --> 04:14.500]  And they put them under oath and act like this is a real trial.
[04:14.500 --> 04:17.500]  The Democrats are a bunch of mindless, crazy lawyers
[04:17.500 --> 04:19.500]  who don't even know how society works.
[04:19.500 --> 04:21.500]  Their average age is about 77,
[04:21.500 --> 04:25.500]  and they don't know what planet they're on.
[04:25.500 --> 04:28.500]  Joe Biden is perfectly emblematic of these people,
[04:28.500 --> 04:30.500]  not being able to find his ass with both hands.
[04:30.500 --> 04:32.500]  I mean, he got off a plane in Israel,
[04:32.500 --> 04:33.500]  we've got the footage coming up,
[04:33.500 --> 04:35.500]  and he literally goes, who am I?
[04:35.500 --> 04:37.500]  He says, where am I? Who am I?
[04:37.500 --> 04:39.500]  And they go, sir, here's the red carpet.
[04:39.500 --> 04:41.500]  He doesn't even know where he's at.
[04:41.500 --> 04:44.500]  I mean, these people are insane.
[04:44.500 --> 04:47.500]  And they have the nuclear codes, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:47.500 --> 04:49.500]  So God help us.
[04:49.500 --> 04:51.500]  I mean, we're in a lot of danger.
[04:51.500 --> 04:53.500]  You can laugh at these people all day, but they're in control,
[04:53.500 --> 04:55.500]  and they are crazy.
[04:55.500 --> 05:24.500]  We got so much to cover, stay with us in FullWars.com.
[05:26.500 --> 05:29.500]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members
[05:29.500 --> 05:31.500]  for this big project we're launching in the near future,
[05:31.500 --> 05:34.500]  you'll also get a personal signed piece of art
[05:34.500 --> 05:37.500]  I made of the sheepdog chasing the wolf
[05:37.500 --> 05:39.500]  and a personal message.
[05:39.500 --> 05:41.500]  It's your last chance to get all three coins
[05:41.500 --> 05:45.500]  at 1776.com.
[05:45.500 --> 05:47.500]  This is history happening now.
[05:47.500 --> 05:49.500]  In FullWars, thanks for your support.
[05:49.500 --> 05:52.500]  It's changing the world, and this is the final 75
[05:52.500 --> 06:02.500]  three-point set exclusively available at 1776.com.
[06:02.500 --> 06:08.500]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[06:08.500 --> 06:10.500]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:10.500 --> 06:12.500]  Well, so does he.
[06:12.500 --> 06:18.500]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:18.500 --> 06:22.500]  What did you think the designed post-industrial collapse
[06:22.500 --> 06:25.500]  of the world economy would look like?
[06:25.500 --> 06:27.500]  Well, you don't need to think what it would look like.
[06:27.500 --> 06:29.500]  You're living in it, I'm living in it.
[06:29.500 --> 06:31.500]  We're living in it together on this Wednesday,
[06:31.500 --> 06:33.500]  July 13th, emergency transmission.
[06:33.500 --> 06:35.500]  Thank you for joining us.
[06:35.500 --> 06:37.500]  Big broadcast, a bunch of special guests in studio.
[06:37.500 --> 06:40.500]  I'll tell you about that coming up next segment.
[06:40.500 --> 06:42.500]  Let me just go over what we're going to be covering here today
[06:42.500 --> 06:46.500]  and then obviously any breaking news as it comes in.
[06:46.500 --> 06:50.500]  Look, the Republicans are having a field day.
[06:50.500 --> 06:53.500]  The talk radio is just beside themselves.
[06:53.500 --> 06:55.500]  It's hilarious. It's fun.
[06:55.500 --> 06:57.500]  There's countless things to make fun of.
[06:57.500 --> 07:02.500]  The Democrats are like a bunch of lobotomized rats on PCP.
[07:02.500 --> 07:05.500]  But when you pull back and know their globalist puppets
[07:05.500 --> 07:07.500]  designed to take the blame for the collapse
[07:07.500 --> 07:10.500]  and that they were chosen because they're so inept to take the blame,
[07:10.500 --> 07:14.500]  then the joke isn't on them, it's on all of us.
[07:14.500 --> 07:20.500]  This is extremely, extremely dangerous situation
[07:20.500 --> 07:23.500]  that we are in right now.
[07:23.500 --> 07:26.500]  The good news is all over the world people are identifying
[07:26.500 --> 07:29.500]  the globalist plan to collapse the economy by design
[07:29.500 --> 07:31.500]  in their own statements.
[07:31.500 --> 07:34.500]  And the fact that they have put their politicians and controllers in
[07:34.500 --> 07:39.500]  in every major government except for Communist China and Russia.
[07:39.500 --> 07:41.500]  Not defending Russia and China, they got their own problems.
[07:41.500 --> 07:44.500]  But Klaus Schwab, the New World Order bragged that they have control
[07:44.500 --> 07:48.500]  of half of the parliaments, half of the cabinets,
[07:48.500 --> 07:52.500]  and governments of the world that they're getting control of another 30-40%.
[07:52.500 --> 07:57.500]  So they are close to having 80-90% control over governments in the world.
[07:57.500 --> 08:00.500]  And they brag they are the corporate global governance.
[08:00.500 --> 08:02.500]  He said a month ago at the Davos meeting, he said,
[08:02.500 --> 08:04.500]  we are in control of the world. We control the future.
[08:04.500 --> 08:06.500]  I probably played the clip 30 times.
[08:06.500 --> 08:10.500]  Should I play it again? I mean, it's incredible.
[08:10.500 --> 08:13.500]  China is now in control of the world.
[08:13.500 --> 08:16.500]  We here in this room control the earth.
[08:16.500 --> 08:20.500]  Soon all nations, I mean, it's, it's, they were Easter bugs.
[08:20.500 --> 08:22.500]  They were owns nothings. They were haves nothings.
[08:22.500 --> 08:25.500]  You can't make this, imagine a James Bond movie where a bald-headed guy
[08:25.500 --> 08:28.500]  pet the cat goes, we will make you eat bugs.
[08:28.500 --> 08:30.500]  You're owns nothing. You have nothing.
[08:30.500 --> 08:35.500]  We are making the farmers in UK and Sri Lanka and Dutch and in,
[08:35.500 --> 08:39.500]  and in Chile, we take their properties for the earth
[08:39.500 --> 08:44.500]  and they are not allowed to grow food or have cow.
[08:44.500 --> 08:48.500]  I have those videos today. We take the cow.
[08:48.500 --> 08:51.500]  You eat the bug.
[08:51.500 --> 08:54.500]  I mean, that's like a hallucination. It's not even real.
[08:54.500 --> 08:59.500]  I have the clips.
[08:59.500 --> 09:05.500]  We are taking, we are making you sell your farms and taking your cows.
[09:05.500 --> 09:12.500]  And as you'll riot in the Netherlands.
[09:12.500 --> 09:15.500]  And, and, and here's, here's the issue.
[09:15.500 --> 09:20.500]  Sri Lanka passed all these exact same laws that the global sell
[09:20.500 --> 09:22.500]  two years ago and they totally collapsed.
[09:22.500 --> 09:25.500]  So that's the difference between Sri Lanka that was a booming amazing economy
[09:25.500 --> 09:30.500]  two years ago and it's now a hellhole with no fuel, almost no food.
[09:30.500 --> 09:35.500]  And what is happening in the Netherlands?
[09:35.500 --> 09:40.500]  I'm going to play an extremely powerful report in the last four minutes
[09:40.500 --> 09:45.500]  of this break that I'm begging you to send to not just people in the U.S.
[09:45.500 --> 09:49.500]  but go on Dutch forums, go on Sri Lankan forums, Indian forums.
[09:49.500 --> 09:50.500]  They're really awake there.
[09:50.500 --> 09:55.500]  Mexican forums, Brazilian forums, they're the most awake on average.
[09:55.500 --> 10:01.500]  Hungarian forums. Just get it out because what the Dutch farmers have done
[10:01.500 --> 10:03.500]  is the model of our victory.
[10:03.500 --> 10:07.500]  They're shutting down the carbon taxes and the environmental tyranny
[10:07.500 --> 10:11.500]  before it takes over, not after.
[10:11.500 --> 10:15.500]  And that's the title of the video that we're going to post on the live show feed today
[10:15.500 --> 10:16.500]  at infowars.com.
[10:16.500 --> 10:20.500]  And I beg you for your own future, my future to share this battle plan.
[10:20.500 --> 10:25.500]  The crucial difference between the fall of Sri Lanka and the Dutch uprising.
[10:25.500 --> 10:30.500]  We're going to play it in 30 seconds and I'm telling you that it doesn't need
[10:30.500 --> 10:32.500]  the customary million views that a Gregory's video gets.
[10:32.500 --> 10:35.500]  They all need 10, 20, 30, 40 million views.
[10:35.500 --> 10:40.500]  If we're going to win, get it, share it to your email, share it everywhere now
[10:40.500 --> 10:43.500]  infowars.com, band.video.
[10:43.500 --> 10:47.500]  We're going to come back and go over all of the worldwide economic collapse by design
[10:47.500 --> 10:48.500]  and how to stop it.
[10:48.500 --> 10:50.500]  The video just went live about 30 minutes ago.
[10:50.500 --> 10:53.500]  It's at band.video. Share it now.
[10:53.500 --> 10:54.500]  And we'll put it on the live show feed.
[10:54.500 --> 10:58.500]  Here is the incredibly important Greg Reese report.
[10:58.500 --> 11:00.500]  This is the key to victory.
[11:06.500 --> 11:11.500]  What we are seeing in Sri Lanka is system failure and that is nothing to celebrate.
[11:11.500 --> 11:14.500]  There is no victory in system failure.
[11:14.500 --> 11:18.500]  In fact, it is what these tyrants are counting on.
[11:18.500 --> 11:22.500]  It's part of the plan and it's been their business model for decades,
[11:22.500 --> 11:25.500]  as simple as the mafia movies on TV.
[11:25.500 --> 11:31.500]  The World Bank and the IMF, strong arm world leaders into accepting loans
[11:31.500 --> 11:34.500]  that are designed to bankrupt the nation.
[11:34.500 --> 11:39.500]  While the CIA acts as management, secretly administering to the overthrow of
[11:39.500 --> 11:42.500]  national sovereignty and the looting of the nation's wealth.
[11:42.500 --> 11:47.500]  This international mafia organization has been doing it like this for years
[11:47.500 --> 11:49.500]  because it always works.
[11:49.500 --> 11:55.500]  They know that once the people become a hungry angry mob, they can be controlled like animals.
[11:55.500 --> 12:01.500]  And this reactive behavior is exactly what these globalist crooks are counting on.
[12:01.500 --> 12:06.500]  It's why they are destroying the world's economies and creating a food crisis.
[12:06.500 --> 12:10.500]  So the answer is to become proactive.
[12:10.500 --> 12:14.500]  And that is exactly what the Dutch are now showing us.
[12:14.500 --> 12:20.500]  How the people of the world can achieve victory against the tyrants of the new world order.
[12:20.500 --> 12:26.500]  The prolific farmers of the Netherlands are the second biggest food exporters in the world.
[12:26.500 --> 12:31.500]  And they know that the World Economic Forum is planning on buying up their land
[12:31.500 --> 12:35.500]  and cutting off the food supply for billions of people.
[12:35.500 --> 12:40.500]  And they also know that the people united are an unstoppable force.
[12:40.500 --> 12:43.500]  And so they united against tyranny.
[12:43.500 --> 12:48.500]  And peacefully, with unstoppable strength, shut down the system.
[12:48.500 --> 12:52.500]  The shelves in many stores are now empty, but it's on their terms.
[12:52.500 --> 12:59.500]  And the people now have the upper hand, as it should be, and could be everywhere if we want it.
[12:59.500 --> 13:03.500]  The New World Order's plan is for all nations to collapse.
[13:03.500 --> 13:07.500]  Which tells us that we must not wait until system failure.
[13:07.500 --> 13:09.500]  We must act now.
[13:09.500 --> 13:14.500]  Many people all over the world are now starting to rise up together with the Dutch farmers.
[13:14.500 --> 13:23.500]  Rising up, not as a reactive, hungry, angry mob, but as a righteous people united in a love for humanity.
[13:23.500 --> 13:29.500]  Society is made up of we the people, and we must now peacefully take control of it.
[13:29.500 --> 13:34.500]  This is the path to victory, and time is quickly running out.
[13:34.500 --> 13:36.500]  The lockdowns are coming back.
[13:36.500 --> 13:38.500]  The pandemic isn't over.
[13:38.500 --> 13:42.500]  As we've said, the pandemic is not over.
[13:42.500 --> 13:45.500]  We need more money to plan for the second pandemic.
[13:45.500 --> 13:48.500]  There's going to be another pandemic. We have to think ahead.
[13:48.500 --> 13:51.500]  China has announced five more years of lockdowns.
[13:51.500 --> 13:55.500]  And if you're awake by now, then you know they're coming back everywhere.
[13:55.500 --> 13:59.500]  With quarantine camps and forced business closures.
[13:59.500 --> 14:04.500]  All designed to mentally break us and collapse society.
[14:04.500 --> 14:10.500]  If we were to believe that we are powerless and weak, or domesticated pets, then yes.
[14:10.500 --> 14:15.500]  The only path would be to wait until the food runs out and then join the angry mob.
[14:15.500 --> 14:21.500]  But if we were to believe that we were righteous and powerful, then we would just fix it.
[14:21.500 --> 14:24.500]  So what's the plan, fellow humans?
[14:24.500 --> 14:28.500]  Do we wait for the inevitable collapse and lose everything?
[14:28.500 --> 14:31.500]  Celebrating system failure?
[14:31.500 --> 14:35.500]  Or do we learn from the Dutch and take control of everything?
[14:35.500 --> 14:40.500]  And fix the system so that it serves we the people?
[14:40.500 --> 14:55.500]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[15:11.500 --> 15:16.500]  Infowars has been banned.
[15:16.500 --> 15:19.500]  Arrested.
[15:19.500 --> 15:23.500]  Attacked and threatened.

[17:38.500 --> 17:40.500]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[17:40.500 --> 17:42.500]  Folks, this is a joke.
[17:42.500 --> 17:43.500]  I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[17:43.500 --> 17:44.500]  It's 75 percent off.
[17:44.500 --> 17:47.500]  By the way, it works for me in case you haven't noticed.
[17:47.500 --> 17:52.500]  The hair and beard formula is working for me quite well.
[17:52.500 --> 17:54.500]  I might add quite well.
[17:54.500 --> 17:57.500]  My barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[17:57.500 --> 18:26.500]  I go and see him quite often now.
[18:27.500 --> 18:36.500]  So Americans and others can get ready, be self-sufficient and fund the info war while saving massive amounts of money on critical items they need.

[18:42.500 --> 18:45.500]  The only way you fail is not visiting preparedtoday.com.
[18:45.500 --> 18:48.500]  There's not a question now whether you need this or not.
[18:48.500 --> 18:49.500]  You need it.
[18:49.500 --> 18:51.500]  Before it was just a backup plan and insurance.
[18:51.500 --> 18:52.500]  This is an insurance.
[18:52.500 --> 18:53.500]  This is survival.
[18:53.500 --> 18:55.500]  Preparetoday.com.
[18:55.500 --> 18:57.500]  And I'll see you there.
[19:25.500 --> 19:32.500]  So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we've got to bring into our bodies to change who we are,
[19:32.500 --> 19:33.500]  are only lowering us.
[19:33.500 --> 19:34.500]  They're only making us more depressed.
[19:34.500 --> 19:37.500]  In the end, they're only making us less filled.
[19:37.500 --> 19:43.500]  It is only by going within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves.
[19:43.500 --> 19:51.500]  That's why the globalist, bombardist, and toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy
[19:51.500 --> 19:55.500]  and to be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[19:55.500 --> 20:24.500]  And that's where the incredible products come in at m4store.com.
[20:24.500 --> 20:26.500]  Bang your head.
[20:26.500 --> 20:29.500]  Take the dead.
[20:29.500 --> 20:31.500]  And out of your trance.
[20:31.500 --> 20:33.500]  They live, we sleep.
[20:33.500 --> 20:43.500]  But now, humanity is rising.
[20:43.500 --> 20:45.500]  All right, let me do this right now.
[20:45.500 --> 20:47.500]  Let me tell you who's coming up on the broadcast today.
[20:47.500 --> 20:59.500]  I'm sitting here before the show and I go right to headline right before we go live.
[20:59.500 --> 21:02.500]  I'm trying to think what's the most important thing out of all these stacks.
[21:02.500 --> 21:09.500]  And I got to say it's this little nugget right here that we'll cover next segment that's getting almost no attention.
[21:09.500 --> 21:18.500]  You know, the United States has pumped in $68 million since February into Ukraine publicly.
[21:18.500 --> 21:22.500]  But obviously, a lot of the funding is clandestine, so we don't know how much has been pumped in.
[21:22.500 --> 21:29.500]  But I said eight years ago when Soros and the globalist over through the electric government of Ukraine, I said,
[21:29.500 --> 21:36.500]  when they call for a Marshall plan, that'll be to bail out their whole system and give themselves trillions.
[21:36.500 --> 21:40.500]  And they're just going to use Ukraine as the money laundering epicenter.
[21:40.500 --> 21:44.500]  Now that's a well-known thing.
[21:44.500 --> 21:50.500]  But here's the new headline out of zero hedge and it links directly to the IMF announcement.
[21:50.500 --> 21:52.500]  And again, this is nowhere else in the news.
[21:52.500 --> 21:56.500]  Imagine this announcement and it's nowhere in the news.
[21:56.500 --> 22:05.500]  Democrats demand $650 billion.
[22:05.500 --> 22:06.500]  That escalates.
[22:06.500 --> 22:11.500]  It's 60-something billion now and now it's going to be $650 billion.
[22:11.500 --> 22:13.500]  Why not?
[22:13.500 --> 22:18.500]  And then you've got Mitt Romney and Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden and all these people,
[22:18.500 --> 22:26.500]  Republican Democrat leaders who are warmongers, the neocons, whose families run the damn companies,
[22:26.500 --> 22:34.500]  the media, the energy, the transportation, the shipyards, everything.
[22:34.500 --> 22:39.500]  I mean, it's just the looting is incredible.
[22:39.500 --> 22:43.500]  And again, they're inflating the currency, but they buy up real stuff as it's inflated,
[22:43.500 --> 22:47.500]  then they pass us the debt and the devaluation.
[22:47.500 --> 22:52.500]  I mean, wow, that is a whopper.
[22:52.500 --> 22:58.500]  That's next segment.
[22:58.500 --> 23:03.500]  And now there's the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, they're all, it's time to go big.
[23:03.500 --> 23:12.500]  Bloomberg, $650 billion IMF aid on Ukraine.
[23:12.500 --> 23:14.500]  So as of this morning, I hadn't hit the news yet.
[23:14.500 --> 23:16.500]  I guess it's hit it now.
[23:16.500 --> 23:20.500]  So they're openly pushing it and they'll get it.
[23:20.500 --> 23:22.500]  And then they've got $68 billion.
[23:22.500 --> 23:24.500]  Why not get $650 billion?
[23:24.500 --> 23:26.500]  And then next week it'll be a trillion.
[23:26.500 --> 23:27.500]  And then how about $50 trillion?
[23:27.500 --> 23:29.500]  How about a quadrillion?
[23:29.500 --> 23:30.500]  How about $50 quadrillion?
[23:30.500 --> 23:33.500]  I mean, why not? Nobody stops them.
[23:33.500 --> 23:35.500]  They give it to themselves.
[23:35.500 --> 23:36.500]  That's the next segment.
[23:36.500 --> 23:42.500]  So that's just one article in my economy stack that is over 100 articles.
[23:42.500 --> 23:45.500]  Each one of these, I can spend the four hours on one of these.
[23:45.500 --> 23:50.500]  All of them just, we are going to buy up all the farmland and not let you produce.
[23:50.500 --> 23:51.500]  These are quotes.
[23:51.500 --> 23:53.500]  We are going to ban the cows.
[23:53.500 --> 23:59.500]  I mean, you own nothing, you have nothing, you like it.
[23:59.500 --> 24:01.500]  And then are you still laughing?
[24:01.500 --> 24:05.500]  A conservative talk show host out there laughing at the Democrats.
[24:05.500 --> 24:06.500]  Oh, they're such idiots.
[24:06.500 --> 24:07.500]  Ha, ha, ha.
[24:07.500 --> 24:08.500]  Everybody hates them.
[24:08.500 --> 24:09.500]  Oh, they stole the election.
[24:09.500 --> 24:12.500]  Yeah, they were stealing it again because they took over because they're in charge
[24:12.500 --> 24:14.500]  and they're pissing in our faces.
[24:14.500 --> 24:16.500]  So I'm not laughing.
[24:16.500 --> 24:18.500]  I'm not celebrating that Joe Biden can't talk.
[24:18.500 --> 24:21.500]  He was put in there so he doesn't know what's going on.
[24:21.500 --> 24:23.500]  So he'll take the blame.
[24:23.500 --> 24:25.500]  He's a birdcage liner.
[24:25.500 --> 24:28.500]  He's a piece of toilet paper.
[24:28.500 --> 24:34.500]  It's the big banks and the big families that run Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and the UN.
[24:34.500 --> 24:37.500]  They are the enemy.
[24:37.500 --> 24:44.500]  And they want us off air because we stand up to their evil.
[24:44.500 --> 24:45.500]  Because you know what?
[24:45.500 --> 24:51.500]  There's something a lot bigger than them and it's called God Almighty.
[24:51.500 --> 24:52.500]  So there's that.
[24:52.500 --> 24:53.500]  That's one article.
[24:53.500 --> 24:58.500]  One article.
[24:58.500 --> 25:00.500]  It's the rest of this.
[25:00.500 --> 25:02.500]  It's more insane.
[25:02.500 --> 25:05.500]  And you look at Biden and Hunter and all of them.
[25:05.500 --> 25:10.500]  They're just a bunch of pedophile drug addicts because they're the placeholder.
[25:10.500 --> 25:12.500]  They don't run anything.
[25:12.500 --> 25:17.500]  And I know I harp on that.
[25:17.500 --> 25:24.500]  We have UK governments, Australia and New Zealand, Canada, US government,
[25:24.500 --> 25:27.500]  all announcing that lockdowns are coming after the election.
[25:27.500 --> 25:29.500]  They're now saying before.
[25:29.500 --> 25:32.500]  National parks, Democrat cities are already bringing back masks.
[25:32.500 --> 25:33.500]  They're already bringing it all.
[25:33.500 --> 25:35.500]  Oh, there's the Ninja variant.
[25:35.500 --> 25:36.500]  You knew that was coming.
[25:36.500 --> 25:38.500]  That's a stat.
[25:38.500 --> 25:42.500]  They're announcing more of their World ID systems and all the rest of it.
[25:42.500 --> 25:44.500]  And then we've got January 6th.
[25:44.500 --> 25:47.500]  Again, no one's watching it.
[25:47.500 --> 25:48.500]  It's a total flop.
[25:48.500 --> 25:51.500]  In fact, a flop is too big a compliment.
[25:51.500 --> 25:53.500]  It is a flat line failure.
[25:53.500 --> 25:54.500]  I've got the ratings.
[25:54.500 --> 25:56.500]  I'll show them to you.
[25:56.500 --> 26:03.500]  But it's important because it gives you a bird's eye view of flying on the wall of
[26:03.500 --> 26:09.500]  what these guys are going to do and how they're setting up their martial law
[26:09.500 --> 26:14.500]  rule by executive fiat dictatorship.
[26:14.500 --> 26:17.500]  So the fact that everybody hates them, the fact that nobody likes them,
[26:17.500 --> 26:23.500]  the fact that their failures, they've already purged the military and police
[26:23.500 --> 26:26.500]  and they're going to make a run at us.
[26:26.500 --> 26:28.500]  They're going to stage more false flags.
[26:28.500 --> 26:31.500]  They're going to implode the border further.
[26:31.500 --> 26:32.500]  It's already gone.
[26:32.500 --> 26:37.500]  So again, I'm not somebody that's going to sit up here and give you fake good news
[26:37.500 --> 26:39.500]  like the Republican Party.
[26:39.500 --> 26:40.500]  All the Democrats were a joke.
[26:40.500 --> 26:41.500]  All will be a tsunami.
[26:41.500 --> 26:43.500]  Oh, they're all going to be swept that office.
[26:43.500 --> 26:49.500]  And what, are the neo-consuls just continuing on the same operation?
[26:49.500 --> 26:51.500]  But the good news is humanity is waking up.
[26:51.500 --> 26:54.500]  And the good news is they're seeing past the puppets for the real problem
[26:54.500 --> 26:58.500]  at these demonstrations in Asia and Africa and Latin America and Europe
[26:58.500 --> 26:59.500]  and North America.
[26:59.500 --> 27:01.500]  And it's beautiful and it's very, very positive.
[27:01.500 --> 27:03.500]  And that's exactly what we've needed.
[27:03.500 --> 27:10.500]  So I say to this audience of activists, bravo to all of you.
[27:10.500 --> 27:12.500]  Bravo to the Ron Poles.
[27:12.500 --> 27:13.500]  Bravo to the Rand Poles.
[27:13.500 --> 27:14.500]  Bravo to the Tucker Carlson's.
[27:14.500 --> 27:16.500]  Bravo to the Joe Rogan's.
[27:16.500 --> 27:17.500]  He's not perfect in the right direction.
[27:17.500 --> 27:19.500]  Bravo to the Larry Pinckney's.
[27:19.500 --> 27:22.500]  Bravo to the Royce White's, who's in studio with us in third hour.
[27:22.500 --> 27:27.500]  Bravo to Roderstone, who didn't buckle under threat of prison to lie about Trump.
[27:27.500 --> 27:28.500]  Bravo to this crew.
[27:28.500 --> 27:31.500]  Bravo to the fact that we're in the fight.
[27:31.500 --> 27:36.500]  And we should celebrate that, that in this game of life that's 100% real
[27:36.500 --> 27:39.500]  and deadly dangerous, baby, we're in the fight
[27:39.500 --> 27:42.500]  and we're starting to turn the tide and starting to win.
[27:42.500 --> 27:45.500]  But I'm not going to butter you up.
[27:45.500 --> 27:49.500]  I'm not going to lie to you about the fact that, yeah, we're winning this fight.
[27:49.500 --> 27:51.500]  We're entering the 12th round right now.
[27:51.500 --> 27:57.500]  And it's like George Foreman and Muhammad Ali, man.
[27:57.500 --> 28:01.500]  It's, it's a, it's, it's, who's got the will?
[28:01.500 --> 28:04.500]  12th round, 12th long round, ladies and gentlemen,
[28:04.500 --> 28:06.500]  where it's not our bodies are going to carry us through it.
[28:06.500 --> 28:08.500]  It's our will.
[28:08.500 --> 28:11.500]  So you decide, ladies and gentlemen, you want to roll over to this
[28:11.500 --> 28:14.500]  or you want to get involved, but now is the time to realize
[28:14.500 --> 28:22.500]  we're entering the 12th round right now.
[28:22.500 --> 28:26.500]  And this is what everything's been building towards and our enemies know it.
[28:26.500 --> 28:29.500]  And yeah, they're falling on their faces and they're a joke and everything else,
[28:29.500 --> 28:32.500]  but they're still in control of the central banks and Hollywood
[28:32.500 --> 28:33.500]  and our children.
[28:33.500 --> 28:36.500]  And it's time for us to remove our support from them in any way we can
[28:36.500 --> 28:39.500]  and speak out against them where we can and pray against them everywhere we can
[28:39.500 --> 28:42.500]  and share the articles and videos and information
[28:42.500 --> 28:45.500]  that is bringing them down like our lives depend on it
[28:45.500 --> 28:51.500]  because our lives do depend on it.
[28:51.500 --> 28:55.500]  We're going to come right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:55.500 --> 28:57.500]  Let's go.
[29:25.500 --> 29:42.500]  So the only way you fail is not taking action today
[29:42.500 --> 29:46.500]  and ordering bodies ultimate to a formula and info or sort of calm.

[33:56.500 --> 33:59.500]  We were supposed to be shut down.
[33:59.500 --> 34:02.500]  We were supposed to be silenced.
[34:02.500 --> 34:06.500]  Thanks to you and thanks to our will.
[34:06.500 --> 34:24.500]  Together, we are strong.
[34:24.500 --> 34:27.500]  We are awakening the planet.
[34:27.500 --> 34:29.500]  Humanity is rising.
[34:29.500 --> 34:31.500]  That's not height.
[34:31.500 --> 34:33.500]  That's fact.
[34:33.500 --> 34:37.500]  Wake the dead.
[34:37.500 --> 34:44.500]  Awaken the sleepers.
[34:44.500 --> 34:53.500]  All right, let's drill right into it right now.
[34:53.500 --> 34:57.500]  We got Roger Stone and others joining us.
[34:57.500 --> 35:00.500]  Pete Santelli in the next hour and again.
[35:00.500 --> 35:06.500]  We're not going to be covering the January 6 show trial because we're in it and being attacked in it.
[35:06.500 --> 35:08.500]  That's passé.
[35:08.500 --> 35:13.500]  That doesn't matter by those we didn't try to attack the capital and provocateurs orchestrated it.
[35:13.500 --> 35:14.500]  We all know that.
[35:14.500 --> 35:21.500]  But it's their whole plan to label and demonize their political opposition to ban questioning election fraud.
[35:21.500 --> 35:24.500]  And that's what they're so scared of.
[35:24.500 --> 35:28.500]  And they're also so frightened of the First Amendment.
[35:28.500 --> 35:37.500]  And so they've already banned fist bumps and OK signs and everything else saying it's bad and evil.
[35:37.500 --> 35:47.500]  Now, the social controllers, the control freaks, the cult leaders have moved on to 1776.
[35:47.500 --> 35:55.500]  And I talked about this yesterday, hours before I didn't know they were going to play a compilation of us talking about 1776.
[35:55.500 --> 35:58.500]  And they're all over the news CNN, MSNBC.
[35:58.500 --> 36:02.500]  Oh, my God, this is codeword for violence and overthrow.
[36:02.500 --> 36:05.500]  No, it's codeword for Declaration of Independence saying we're not your slaves.
[36:05.500 --> 36:06.500]  Look at the Dutch farmers.
[36:06.500 --> 36:07.500]  Look at the Sri Lankans.
[36:07.500 --> 36:08.500]  Look at everybody else.
[36:08.500 --> 36:10.500]  It's codeword for ain't a codeword.
[36:10.500 --> 36:15.500]  It means we are awake to you and we reject you and we declare independence from you.
[36:15.500 --> 36:18.500]  And we're trying to fix this peacefully.
[36:18.500 --> 36:21.500]  So here's one of the clips they played with my face up there.
[36:21.500 --> 36:25.500]  60-foot jumbotron in this production that almost no one's watching.
[36:25.500 --> 36:30.500]  But again, it gives you a window into their brains and what they're planning.
[36:30.500 --> 36:31.500]  Here it is.
[36:31.500 --> 36:33.500]  The open door of the Oval Office.
[36:33.500 --> 36:38.500]  The president could hear the sound of the crowd and the music at the rally at the Freedom Plaza.
[36:38.500 --> 36:42.500]  And these are some of the things that they were saying there at the Plaza.
[36:42.500 --> 36:48.500]  Just blocks from where the president sat that evening, excited for the next day.
[36:48.500 --> 36:57.500]  This is nothing less than an epic struggle for the future of this country between dark and light.
[36:57.500 --> 37:01.500]  Between the godly and the godless.
[37:01.500 --> 37:04.500]  Between good and evil.
[37:04.500 --> 37:12.500]  And we will win this fight or America will step off into a thousand years of darkness.
[37:12.500 --> 37:20.500]  Tomorrow, tomorrow, trust me, the American people that are standing on the soil that we are standing on tonight,
[37:20.500 --> 37:22.500]  and they're going to be standing on this soil tomorrow.
[37:22.500 --> 37:28.500]  This is soil that we have fought over, fought for, and we will fight for in the future.
[37:28.500 --> 37:33.500]  The members of Congress, the members of the House of Representatives,
[37:33.500 --> 37:40.500]  the members of the United States Senate, those of you who are feeling weak tonight,
[37:40.500 --> 37:43.500]  those of you that don't have the moral fiber in your body,
[37:43.500 --> 37:47.500]  get some tonight because tomorrow we the people are going to be here
[37:47.500 --> 37:51.500]  and we want you to know that we will not stand for a lie.
[37:51.500 --> 37:54.500]  We will not stand for a lie.
[37:54.500 --> 38:01.500]  I want them to know that 1776 is always an option.
[38:01.500 --> 38:04.500]  Yeah!
[38:07.500 --> 38:11.500]  These degenerates and the deans today are going to give us what we want
[38:11.500 --> 38:15.500]  or we are going to shut this country down.
[38:18.500 --> 38:21.500]  It's 1776!
[38:21.500 --> 38:24.500]  1776!
[38:24.500 --> 38:27.500]  1776!
[38:27.500 --> 38:30.500]  1776!
[38:30.500 --> 38:33.500]  1776!
[38:33.500 --> 38:37.500]  So, the Democrats burned down billions of dollars in buildings.
[38:37.500 --> 38:39.500]  They shoot and kill a bunch of people.
[38:39.500 --> 38:42.500]  They rob and loot and that's all loving and good.
[38:42.500 --> 38:46.500]  We say we're here not accepting this fraud and it's the end of the world,
[38:46.500 --> 38:48.500]  worse than Pearl Harbor, worse than 9-11.
[38:48.500 --> 38:52.500]  Chuck E. Schumer and others said that, they still say it.
[38:52.500 --> 38:55.500]  But if you look at the Dutch farmers taking over the country
[38:55.500 --> 38:57.500]  or you look at Sri Lanka, storming the government buildings,
[38:57.500 --> 39:00.500]  you look at all this, the army is like, oh, that's protest.
[39:00.500 --> 39:02.500]  Any time anybody uprises it's protest,
[39:02.500 --> 39:04.500]  because usually it's the CIA overthrowing the country,
[39:04.500 --> 39:07.500]  that's not the case here.
[39:07.500 --> 39:13.500]  But they are so incredibly scared
[39:13.500 --> 39:16.500]  that the Chinese are rushing the central banks and bank rods,
[39:16.500 --> 39:21.500]  that it's happening all over the world in every major country.
[39:21.500 --> 39:26.500]  The people know who the enemies are.
[39:26.500 --> 39:29.500]  So, here's a couple clips from a few years ago.
[39:29.500 --> 39:36.500]  Kamala Harris agreed with the claim that Trump didn't really win in 2016.
[39:36.500 --> 39:40.500]  And then here is Jamie Raskin heading up the January 6th committee,
[39:40.500 --> 39:43.500]  objecting to the electoral college in 2016.
[39:43.500 --> 39:46.500]  Something he now says is treason and illegal,
[39:46.500 --> 39:48.500]  because they know they're getting ready to steal the next elections.
[39:48.500 --> 39:50.500]  Here's the clips back to back.
[39:50.500 --> 39:52.500]  Elections matter.
[39:52.500 --> 39:56.500]  When you win an election, you get to set the rules.
[39:56.500 --> 39:58.500]  How can you win with Russian interference, though?
[39:58.500 --> 39:59.500]  That's the real thing.
[39:59.500 --> 40:00.500]  That's what I'm scared about in 2020.
[40:00.500 --> 40:01.500]  But rightly.
[40:01.500 --> 40:03.500]  Because I think you're the illegitimate president that didn't really win.
[40:03.500 --> 40:06.500]  So, how do you, you know, fight against that in 2020?
[40:06.500 --> 40:08.500]  You are absolutely right.
[40:08.500 --> 40:11.500]  So, again, as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
[40:11.500 --> 40:17.500]  I will tell you that we should believe exactly what the intelligence community has told us,
[40:17.500 --> 40:22.500]  which is Russia did interfere in the election of the president of the United States in 2016.
[40:22.500 --> 40:23.500]  Right.
[40:23.500 --> 40:30.500]  I have an objection, because 10 of the 29 electoral votes cast by Florida were cast by electors,
[40:30.500 --> 40:36.500]  not lawfully certified, because they violated Florida's...
[40:36.500 --> 40:38.500]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:38.500 --> 40:41.500]  That's where they're at.
[40:41.500 --> 40:42.500]  Everybody's turned against them.
[40:42.500 --> 40:43.500]  Everybody hates them.
[40:43.500 --> 40:46.500]  They're just little puppet lawyers put in there.
[40:46.500 --> 40:57.500]  And they are still re-sockling the lies of six years ago that Russia put Trump in.
[40:57.500 --> 40:59.500]  But nobody's buying.
[40:59.500 --> 41:00.500]  What are they going to do?
[41:00.500 --> 41:01.500]  I showed you this earlier.
[41:01.500 --> 41:06.500]  Here's a Google Trends comparison for searches over the last few days of topics on January 6th
[41:06.500 --> 41:11.500]  in blue and Jill Biden taco comment, taco Tuesday in red.
[41:11.500 --> 41:17.500]  100 times, you get it all together, it's thousands of times, 100 times the searches.
[41:17.500 --> 41:19.500]  It's right at 100.
[41:19.500 --> 41:37.500]  100 times the searches for tacos, Jill Biden, Dr. Jill Biden, versus their stupid January 6th kangaroo court.
[41:37.500 --> 41:38.500]  And that's why they're so panicked.
[41:38.500 --> 41:40.500]  That's why they're so scared.
[41:40.500 --> 41:46.500]  And then they also inadvertently screwed up during the event and showed documents that
[41:46.500 --> 41:53.500]  Trump had a stage set where we were supposed to go and that they had been covering up
[41:53.500 --> 41:56.500]  a stage right behind the Capitol by the Supreme Court.
[41:56.500 --> 42:02.500]  And that's where Trump was trying to go, as if we wanted to attack the Capitol and look like idiots.
[42:02.500 --> 42:04.500]  They were able to rope in a few people to do that.
[42:04.500 --> 42:10.500]  So they want to in free speech, have total censorship, shut all their political opposition down
[42:10.500 --> 42:16.500]  over four U.S. citizens like Ashley Mabit that they killed and then a cop that had a heart attack
[42:16.500 --> 42:17.500]  and died two days later.
[42:17.500 --> 42:20.500]  They call that worse than Pearl Harbor, worse than 9-11.
[42:20.500 --> 42:26.500]  Anybody with functioning brain cells knows that is an insulting lie.
[42:26.500 --> 42:32.500]  And as an affront to those that died on 9-11 and at Pearl Harbor and the Japanese attack that brought
[42:32.500 --> 42:37.500]  the U.S. into World War II, it's just fantastic level BS.
[42:37.500 --> 42:40.500]  Biden's bag of video saying there is no inflation.
[42:40.500 --> 42:42.500]  I mean, it's fantastical level BS.
[42:42.500 --> 42:47.500]  It's all they've got because they're a rearguard action of the globalist.
[42:47.500 --> 42:51.500]  All right, we're going to come back with economic news straight ahead and more.
[42:51.500 --> 42:53.500]  And then Roger Stone, Pete Santilli join us.
[42:53.500 --> 42:56.500]  And then Royce White in studio is coming up today.
[42:56.500 --> 42:59.500]  Stay with us.
[42:59.500 --> 43:05.500]  Seven months ago in December of 2021, we launched the first three-coin founding member series,
[43:05.500 --> 43:08.500]  George Washington slaying the dragon.
[43:08.500 --> 43:10.500]  Then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin.
[43:10.500 --> 43:14.500]  And finally, the second amendment, come and take it, Molan Lobby coin.
[43:14.500 --> 43:25.500]  There are only 75 points left in the three-point series exclusively right now at 1776point.com.
[43:25.500 --> 43:30.500]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members for this big project we're launching
[43:30.500 --> 43:31.500]  in the near future.
[43:31.500 --> 43:36.500]  You'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made of the sheepdog chasing the wolf
[43:36.500 --> 43:37.500]  and a personal message.

[43:46.500 --> 43:49.500]  Infowars thanks to your support is changing the world.

[44:59.500 --> 45:04.500]  We here at Infowars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[45:04.500 --> 45:07.500]  is now available at InfowarsStore.com.
[45:07.500 --> 45:11.500]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today.
[45:11.500 --> 45:16.500]  Though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation
[45:16.500 --> 45:18.500]  and euphoric effects.
[45:18.500 --> 45:23.500]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[45:23.500 --> 45:28.500]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[45:28.500 --> 45:32.500]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[45:32.500 --> 45:34.500]  loosen up a little.
[45:34.500 --> 45:38.500]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[45:38.500 --> 45:44.500]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava,
[45:44.500 --> 45:50.500]  but other herbs including, but not limited to, German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and
[45:50.500 --> 45:51.500]  Balarian root.
[45:51.500 --> 45:56.500]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting
[45:56.500 --> 46:19.500]  InfowarsStore.com.
[46:26.500 --> 46:51.500]  Thank you.
[46:51.500 --> 47:07.500]  Thank you.
[47:21.500 --> 47:28.500]  Meanwhile, other key Trump supporters including far-right media personalities began promoting
[47:28.500 --> 47:55.500]  the Wild Protest on January 6th.
[47:55.500 --> 48:02.500]  And now Donald Trump is calling on his supporters to descend on Washington, D.C., January 6th.
[48:02.500 --> 48:08.500]  He is now calling on we, the people, to take action and to show our numbers.
[48:08.500 --> 48:16.500]  We're going to only be saved by millions of Americans moving to Washington, occupying
[48:16.500 --> 48:22.500]  the entire area, if necessary, storming right into the capital.
[48:22.500 --> 48:25.500]  Now there, we know the rules of engagement.
[48:25.500 --> 48:31.500]  If you have enough people, you can push down any kind of a fence or a wall.
[48:31.500 --> 48:33.500]  This could be Trump's last stand.
[48:33.500 --> 48:39.500]  And it's a time when he has specifically called on his supporters to arrive in D.C.
[48:39.500 --> 48:42.500]  That's something that may actually be the big push.
[48:42.500 --> 48:45.500]  Trump supporters need to say, this is it.
[48:45.500 --> 48:46.500]  It's now or never.
[48:46.500 --> 48:48.500]  You better understand something, son.
[48:48.500 --> 48:50.500]  You better understand something.
[48:50.500 --> 48:52.500]  Red wave, bitch.
[48:52.500 --> 48:55.500]  This is going to be a red wedding going down January 6th.
[48:55.500 --> 48:59.500]  On that day, Trump says, show up for a protest.
[48:59.500 --> 49:01.500]  It's going to be wild.
[49:01.500 --> 49:06.500]  And based on what we've already seen from the previous events, I think Trump is absolutely correct.
[49:06.500 --> 49:08.500]  Motherfucker, you better look outside.
[49:08.500 --> 49:10.500]  You better look out on January 6th.
[49:10.500 --> 49:12.500]  Kick that fucking door open.
[49:12.500 --> 49:13.500]  Look down the street.
[49:13.500 --> 49:17.500]  It's going to be a million-plus geeked-up armed Americans.
[49:17.500 --> 49:21.500]  The time for games is over. The time for action is now.
[49:21.500 --> 49:23.500]  Where were you when history called?
[49:23.500 --> 49:28.500]  Where were you when you and your children's destiny and future was on the line?
[49:30.500 --> 49:31.500]  Meanwhile, the Democrats...
[49:31.500 --> 49:34.500]  In that clip, you heard one of Trump supporters predict a red wedding,
[49:34.500 --> 49:37.500]  which is a pop culture reference to mass slaughter.
[49:37.500 --> 49:48.500]  But the point is that Trump's call to Washington reverberated powerfully and pervasively online.
[49:48.500 --> 49:51.500]  A red wave, a red wedding is now murder.
[49:51.500 --> 49:53.500]  I thought it was been a Republican wave.
[49:53.500 --> 49:59.500]  Meanwhile, people all over the world are standing up for the globalists and taking over governments.
[49:59.500 --> 50:01.500]  They stole the election, ladies and gentlemen.
[50:01.500 --> 50:02.500]  They know they stole it.
[50:02.500 --> 50:11.500]  And they're desperate criminals put in there to maintain this financial globalist dictatorship over our country.
[50:11.500 --> 50:15.500]  But the good news is, as I showed you earlier, 100 times, right at 100 times,
[50:15.500 --> 50:20.500]  the search is on Google for Jill Biden, Dr. Jill Biden,
[50:20.500 --> 50:29.500]  taco comment versus the entire January 6th show-troll.
[50:29.500 --> 50:35.500]  But they target yours truly and say, we wanted violence, but it's the last thing we wanted.
[50:35.500 --> 50:36.500]  But here's the really big news.
[50:36.500 --> 50:41.500]  Jack Pesovic breaking January 6th committee accidentally presents evidence.
[50:41.500 --> 50:48.500]  There was a second stage in the Supreme Court that Trump wanted people to march to that we had the permit for.
[50:48.500 --> 50:51.500]  The Supreme Court is directly behind the U.S. Capitol from the ellipse.
[50:51.500 --> 50:54.500]  This revelation debunks the entire insurrection narrative.
[50:54.500 --> 50:58.500]  But it's not been a revelation.
[50:58.500 --> 50:59.500]  I said it weeks before.
[50:59.500 --> 51:00.500]  I said it days before.
[51:00.500 --> 51:01.500]  I said it that day.
[51:01.500 --> 51:07.500]  I tried to get people to go to that stage.
[51:07.500 --> 51:14.500]  Here's a map of where we were supposed to go from the ellipse, where we were let out,
[51:14.500 --> 51:21.500]  where we were supposed to go down to the area beside the Capitol and the Supreme Court.
[51:21.500 --> 51:22.500]  But we diverted down.
[51:22.500 --> 51:23.500]  We heard there was violence.
[51:23.500 --> 51:27.500]  We tried to stop what was happening right here.
[51:27.500 --> 51:33.500]  So instead of traveling from the ellipse, trying to lead the march, it already left before us.
[51:33.500 --> 51:34.500]  We were in the middle of it.
[51:34.500 --> 51:36.500]  We diverted here to try to stop it.
[51:36.500 --> 51:38.500]  We were able to stop it.
[51:38.500 --> 51:43.500]  We let people around to where we had the stage, but no one was there.
[51:43.500 --> 51:44.500]  And that's what we did.
[51:44.500 --> 51:45.500]  And that's on record.
[51:45.500 --> 51:49.500]  And they subpoenaed us and asked, what did you do?
[51:49.500 --> 51:51.500]  Well, it's on video.
[51:51.500 --> 51:53.500]  It was streamed by thousands of people.
[51:53.500 --> 51:56.500]  And by us, it's all on record every minute of it.
[51:56.500 --> 52:02.500]  Us learning people were fighting the police, us rushing to stop it.
[52:02.500 --> 52:07.500]  And instead, you go to national news, you go to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
[52:07.500 --> 52:08.500]  It's everywhere.
[52:08.500 --> 52:14.500]  Jones was in a secret meeting with Steve Bannon and Roger Stone and Ali Alexander.
[52:14.500 --> 52:16.500]  And they planned the attack to Willard.
[52:16.500 --> 52:19.500]  I've never met Steve Bannon in person.
[52:19.500 --> 52:20.500]  Talked to him once on the phone.
[52:20.500 --> 52:21.500]  I've tried to get him on the show.
[52:21.500 --> 52:22.500]  Tried to get on the show.
[52:22.500 --> 52:23.500]  Won't do it.
[52:23.500 --> 52:25.500]  Him and Roger hate each other.
[52:25.500 --> 52:27.500]  And they know that.
[52:27.500 --> 52:28.500]  And there was no meeting.
[52:28.500 --> 52:32.500]  We did a few interviews with Roger and General Flynn at the hotel.
[52:32.500 --> 52:35.500]  And that's the nicest hotel in the area where everybody stayed.
[52:35.500 --> 52:38.500]  But that idea that then, oh, there's this proof.
[52:38.500 --> 52:43.500]  And we were there planning all this is just preposterous.
[52:43.500 --> 52:46.500]  And I know as an audience, you know that you're sick of even hearing about it.
[52:46.500 --> 52:51.500]  But they even put in the congressional record at the show trial.
[52:51.500 --> 52:57.500]  The text messages they got from Mike Lindell to Kylie Kramer.
[52:57.500 --> 53:03.500]  And Lindell is like, yeah, we're going to have a demonstration at the Supreme Court.
[53:03.500 --> 53:05.500]  We have a stage for the president.
[53:05.500 --> 53:10.500]  And they act like that's evidence that Trump wanted to attack the Capitol when there it is again.
[53:10.500 --> 53:12.500]  We have the damn permit.
[53:12.500 --> 53:15.500]  It's not like it's some secret.
[53:15.500 --> 53:18.500]  And I see these tweets everywhere.
[53:18.500 --> 53:25.500]  Alex Jones yelling 1776 and Boba tweeting it is definitely part of the dot connection.
[53:25.500 --> 53:31.500]  Oh, my gosh, we talk about 1776.
[53:31.500 --> 53:38.500]  And it just goes on and on from there.
[53:38.500 --> 53:41.500]  So that's why we're going to cover it because they're planning more false flags.
[53:41.500 --> 53:46.500]  They can question elections, but nobody else is supposed to do it because they're planning on
[53:46.500 --> 53:49.500]  stealing the midterms and 118 days.
[53:49.500 --> 53:53.500]  They're planning on stealing the main election coming up.
[53:53.500 --> 53:55.500]  Trump has not announced yet.
[53:55.500 --> 53:58.500]  He told a bunch of people, the members of Congress and Roger Stone.
[53:58.500 --> 54:00.500]  He might have announced this early July 4th.
[54:00.500 --> 54:02.500]  I did my prediction was not wrong.
[54:02.500 --> 54:07.500]  By the way, I said he is told people he may declare as early July 4th hasn't done it yet.
[54:07.500 --> 54:12.500]  I say the sooner, the better to absolutely take over the narrative and go after Joe Biden.
[54:12.500 --> 54:15.500]  If the Republicans won't try to impeach him to expose his crimes.
[54:15.500 --> 54:18.500]  Trump needs to publicly impeach him and run for office now.
[54:18.500 --> 54:20.500]  And I got big problems with Trump.
[54:20.500 --> 54:21.500]  In fact, pull the clip up.
[54:21.500 --> 54:22.500]  I'll play it next hour.
[54:22.500 --> 54:25.500]  We were going to play it yesterday, but he won't say the F.
[54:25.500 --> 54:27.500]  He will say the F word was the headline.
[54:27.500 --> 54:31.500]  Trump will say the F word, but not the V word.
[54:31.500 --> 54:42.500]  And he says, I won't say the word, but I'm proud of what we did with therapeutics and that other thing.
[54:42.500 --> 54:45.500]  In fact, here's the clip for yourself.
[54:45.500 --> 54:51.500]  We did so much in terms of therapeutics and a word that I'm not allowed to mention, but I'm still proud of that word.
[54:51.500 --> 54:54.500]  So I'd hit him on the left. I'd hit him on the right.
[54:54.500 --> 54:58.500]  I'd hit him in the f**king center, sir.
[54:58.500 --> 55:05.500]  Well, at least he's back in office, stupid, poisoned shots, but regardless, we're exposing it all.
[55:05.500 --> 55:09.500]  I want to thank listeners in our 28-year history of keeping us on air.
[55:09.500 --> 55:10.500]  You've done an incredible job.
[55:10.500 --> 55:11.500]  We're in this war together.
[55:11.500 --> 55:13.500]  We're in the 12th round of this battle.
[55:13.500 --> 55:16.500]  We've got the advantage, but we've got to press harder than ever.
[55:16.500 --> 55:22.500]  And I just want to encourage you all to get products you need that will enrich your life at the same time as keeping us on air.
[55:22.500 --> 55:29.500]  Now, we came out four years ago with Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, went to the top lab in the country,
[55:29.500 --> 55:32.500]  and we said, what's the strongest your humanoid you've got?
[55:32.500 --> 55:38.500]  They said, well, the strongest one is like medical grade at 75% of your humanoid.
[55:38.500 --> 55:44.500]  That's the essence of the turmeric that's anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, great for your immune system.
[55:44.500 --> 55:46.500]  It's incredible.
[55:46.500 --> 55:47.500]  I said, well, how high can you go?
[55:47.500 --> 55:51.500]  They said 95%, 94%.
[55:51.500 --> 55:55.500]  95% of your humanoid tested.
[55:55.500 --> 55:58.500]  The strongest concentrate on the market of turmeric.
[55:58.500 --> 56:04.500]  And again, my wife has joint pain from sports, tennis, and all that stuff.
[56:04.500 --> 56:08.500]  This is a female version of Arnold Schwarzenegger with her clothes off, it's insane.
[56:08.500 --> 56:13.500]  And she's like, well, I take three or four horse pills of turmeric and they barely help.
[56:13.500 --> 56:14.500]  I take one of these, it works better.
[56:14.500 --> 56:15.500]  Why is that?
[56:15.500 --> 56:23.500]  And I said, sweetheart, it's because it's concentrated, your humanoid with a bunch of other natural compounds that accelerated into your tissue.
[56:23.500 --> 56:26.500]  It is finally back in stock after eight months being sold out.
[56:26.500 --> 56:37.500]  This is the last of these ultimate turmeric formula, infowarstore.com, it's 25% off, joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, turmeric root extract, 95% of humanoid,

[56:48.500 --> 56:50.500]  It also helps you lose weight.
[56:50.500 --> 56:51.500]  It does so much.
[56:51.500 --> 56:58.500]  Everybody should go to infowarstore.com right now and get body's ultimate turmeric formula back in stock.
[56:58.500 --> 57:03.500]  And at current sales rates, it'll be gone in 15 days, but in three months more comes in.

[57:30.500 --> 57:32.500]  And by the way, we have Ultra 12.
[57:32.500 --> 57:34.500]  That's 50% off.
[57:34.500 --> 57:36.500]  I didn't even know they did that deal.
[57:36.500 --> 57:38.500]  And 50% off, vitamin D3 gummies.
[57:38.500 --> 57:41.500]  Everything's got to be cleared out to fund our operation.
[57:41.500 --> 57:45.500]  infowarstore.com, aid us in this critical time.
[57:45.500 --> 58:12.500]  7 months ago, in December of 2021, we launched the first in the three-coin founding member series, George Washington, Slaying the Dragon.
[58:12.500 --> 58:21.500]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members for this big project, we're launching in the near future.
[58:21.500 --> 58:28.500]  You'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made of the sheepdog chasing the wolf in a personal message.
[58:28.500 --> 58:34.500]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776.com.
[58:34.500 --> 58:36.500]  This is history happening now.
[58:36.500 --> 58:49.500]  Infowarstation support is changing the world, and this is the final 75 three-coin set exclusively available at 1776.com.
[58:55.500 --> 58:56.500]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[58:56.500 --> 58:58.500]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[58:58.500 --> 58:59.500]  It is.
[58:59.500 --> 59:03.500]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[59:03.500 --> 59:07.500]  The fish oil is better than that, and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[59:07.500 --> 59:12.500]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[59:12.500 --> 59:16.500]  Crill oils is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm just sorry.
[59:16.500 --> 59:18.500]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[59:18.500 --> 59:20.500]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[59:20.500 --> 59:21.500]  It's so good.
[59:21.500 --> 59:23.500]  In my view, I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[59:23.500 --> 59:26.500]  I eat five caplets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[59:26.500 --> 59:29.500]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[59:29.500 --> 59:35.500]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[59:37.500 --> 59:40.500]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you know what, I just obsess,
[59:40.500 --> 59:43.500]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[59:43.500 --> 59:44.500]  I just can't do it.
[59:44.500 --> 1:00:09.500]  Alright, Rodger Stone is loaded for bear on the election, on the economy, on the January 6th.
[1:00:09.500 --> 1:00:14.500]  Kangaroo show trials, it's all coming up, and some amazing hit rap song.
[1:00:14.500 --> 1:00:15.500]  It's got released a few hours ago.
[1:00:15.500 --> 1:00:18.500]  It's already got a million views on Twitter, about 100 by the laptop.
[1:00:18.500 --> 1:00:19.500]  That's coming up next segment.
[1:00:19.500 --> 1:00:25.500]  But let me tell you, I played this Greg Reese report at the start of the first hour,
[1:00:25.500 --> 1:00:30.500]  and everybody's got to get it out, because what he's saying is 100% true,
[1:00:30.500 --> 1:00:35.500]  and if you want victory, this is what we need.
[1:00:35.500 --> 1:00:39.500]  The crucial difference between the fall of Sri Lanka and the Dutch uprising,
[1:00:39.500 --> 1:00:45.500]  so important to understand the enemy's attack on our infrastructure, economy, and our future.
[1:00:45.500 --> 1:00:52.500]  This is like giving a starving man food, or a person dying of thirst in the desert water.
[1:00:52.500 --> 1:00:55.500]  Here is the report, and we'll be right back with Rodger Stone.
[1:00:55.500 --> 1:00:57.500]  Stay with us.
[1:00:57.500 --> 1:01:08.500]  What we are seeing in Sri Lanka is system failure, and that is nothing to celebrate.
[1:01:08.500 --> 1:01:11.500]  There is no victory in system failure.
[1:01:11.500 --> 1:01:14.500]  In fact, it is what these tyrants are counting on.
[1:01:14.500 --> 1:01:19.500]  It's part of the plan, and it's been their business model for decades.
[1:01:19.500 --> 1:01:22.500]  As simple as the mafia movies on TV.
[1:01:22.500 --> 1:01:31.500]  The World Bank and the IMF, strong arm world leaders into accepting loans that are designed to bankrupt the nation.
[1:01:31.500 --> 1:01:39.500]  While the CIA acts as management, secretly administering to the overthrow of national sovereignty and the looting of the nation's wealth.
[1:01:39.500 --> 1:01:46.500]  This international mafia organization has been doing it like this for years, because it always works.
[1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:52.500]  They know that once the people become a hungry angry mob, they can be controlled like animals.
[1:01:52.500 --> 1:01:58.500]  And this reactive behavior is exactly what these globalist crooks are counting on.
[1:01:58.500 --> 1:02:04.500]  It's why they are destroying the world's economies, and creating a food crisis.
[1:02:04.500 --> 1:02:11.500]  So the answer is to become proactive, and that is exactly what the Dutch are now showing us.
[1:02:11.500 --> 1:02:17.500]  How the people of the world can achieve victory against the tyrants of the new world order.
[1:02:17.500 --> 1:02:23.500]  The prolific farmers of the Netherlands are the second biggest food exporters in the world.
[1:02:23.500 --> 1:02:32.500]  And they know that the World Economic Forum is planning on buying up their land and cutting off the food supply for billions of people.
[1:02:32.500 --> 1:02:37.500]  And they also know that the people united are an unstoppable force.
[1:02:37.500 --> 1:02:45.500]  And so they united against tyranny, and peacefully, with unstoppable strength, shut down the system.
[1:02:45.500 --> 1:02:49.500]  The shelves in many stores are now empty, but it's on their terms.
[1:02:49.500 --> 1:02:56.500]  And the people now have the upper hand, as it should be, and could be everywhere if we want it.
[1:02:56.500 --> 1:03:04.500]  The New World Order's plan is for all nations to collapse, which tells us that we must not wait until system failure.
[1:03:04.500 --> 1:03:06.500]  We must act now.
[1:03:06.500 --> 1:03:11.500]  Many people all over the world are now starting to rise up together with the Dutch farmers,
[1:03:11.500 --> 1:03:20.500]  rising up not as a reactive, hungry, angry mob, but as a righteous people united in a love for humanity.
[1:03:20.500 --> 1:03:26.500]  Society is made up of we the people, and we must now peacefully take control of it.
[1:03:26.500 --> 1:03:31.500]  This is the path to victory, and time is quickly running out.
[1:03:31.500 --> 1:03:33.500]  The lockdowns are coming back.
[1:03:33.500 --> 1:03:36.500]  The pandemic isn't over.
[1:03:36.500 --> 1:03:39.500]  As we've said, the pandemic is not over.
[1:03:39.500 --> 1:03:42.500]  We need more money to plan for the second pandemic.
[1:03:42.500 --> 1:03:45.500]  There's going to be another pandemic. We have to think ahead.
[1:03:45.500 --> 1:03:53.500]  China has announced five more years of lockdowns, and if you're awake by now, then you know they're coming back everywhere,
[1:03:53.500 --> 1:04:01.500]  with quarantine camps and forced business closures, all designed to mentally break us and collapse society.
[1:04:01.500 --> 1:04:07.500]  If we were to believe that we are powerless and weak or domesticated pets, then yes,
[1:04:07.500 --> 1:04:13.500]  the only path would be to wait until the food runs out and then join the angry mob.
[1:04:13.500 --> 1:04:19.500]  But if we were to believe that we were righteous and powerful, then we would just fix it.
[1:04:19.500 --> 1:04:21.500]  So what's the plan, fellow humans?
[1:04:21.500 --> 1:04:28.500]  Do we wait for the inevitable collapse and lose everything, celebrating system failure?
[1:04:28.500 --> 1:04:37.500]  Or do we learn from the Dutch and take control of everything and fix the system so that it serves we the people?
[1:04:37.500 --> 1:04:58.500]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:04:58.500 --> 1:05:01.500]  Sold out for seven months.

[1:06:09.500 --> 1:06:12.500]  Working on the weekend like usual.
[1:06:12.500 --> 1:06:18.500]  Way off in the deep end like usual.
[1:06:18.500 --> 1:06:21.500]  I swear they passed us, they doing too much.
[1:06:21.500 --> 1:06:24.500]  Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turned up.
[1:06:24.500 --> 1:06:27.500]  Virgil got a paddock on my wrist going nuts.
[1:06:27.500 --> 1:06:30.500]  Caught me slipping once, okay, so what?
[1:06:30.500 --> 1:06:33.500]  Someone hit your block up, I tell you it feels us.
[1:06:33.500 --> 1:06:36.500]  Man, a house in Rosewood, it's too plush.
[1:06:36.500 --> 1:06:39.500]  Say my days a number, but I keep waking up.
[1:06:39.500 --> 1:06:42.500]  Baby, please say something, wine by the glass.
[1:06:42.500 --> 1:06:44.500]  Man, a cheapskate, huh?
[1:06:44.500 --> 1:06:47.500]  Gotta move on, my release day, huh?
[1:06:47.500 --> 1:06:49.500]  This is fame, not clout.
[1:06:49.500 --> 1:06:51.500]  I don't even know what that's about.
[1:06:51.500 --> 1:06:52.500]  Watch your mouth.
[1:06:52.500 --> 1:06:55.500]  Baby, got an ego twice the size of the crib.
[1:06:55.500 --> 1:06:58.500]  I can never tell if it is what it is.
[1:06:58.500 --> 1:07:01.500]  But said what I had to and did what I did.
[1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:04.500]  Never turned my back on every cheek, I forget.
[1:07:04.500 --> 1:07:07.500]  Virgil got a paddock on my wrist doing front flips.
[1:07:07.500 --> 1:07:10.500]  Giving you my number, but don't hit me on the gun.
[1:07:10.500 --> 1:07:13.500]  Working on a weekend like usual.
[1:07:13.500 --> 1:07:16.500]  Way off in the deep end like usual.
[1:07:16.500 --> 1:07:19.500]  Swear they passed us, they doing too much.
[1:07:19.500 --> 1:07:22.500]  Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turned up.
[1:07:22.500 --> 1:07:25.500]  Virgil got a paddock on my wrist going nuts.
[1:07:25.500 --> 1:07:27.500]  Caught me slipping once, okay, so what?
[1:07:27.500 --> 1:07:30.500]  Here's a new hit song by Bryson Gray, the one right to Roger Stone.
[1:07:30.500 --> 1:07:33.500]  This got a million views on Twitter in one day.
[1:07:33.500 --> 1:07:37.500]  Exposing Hunter Biden, freedom is popular.
[1:08:03.500 --> 1:08:07.500]  Here we go again.
[1:08:07.500 --> 1:08:10.500]  If it was Trump Jr., it would be on CNN.
[1:08:10.500 --> 1:08:12.500]  This what happens when you risk it to a slater scene.
[1:08:12.500 --> 1:08:15.500]  This what happens when the devil knocks you, let him in.
[1:08:15.500 --> 1:08:17.500]  Nah, I don't care about who this a being.
[1:08:17.500 --> 1:08:19.500]  Buying crime family, they all belong in a pen.
[1:08:19.500 --> 1:08:22.500]  Buying love's minors, that's the real BLM.
[1:08:22.500 --> 1:08:24.500]  Tell me what you want, but at least I ain't a damn.
[1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:27.500]  Wait, hold up, don't get mad at me.
[1:08:27.500 --> 1:08:29.500]  Am I tripping or is he in bed with Natalie?
[1:08:29.500 --> 1:08:32.500]  Why here recording all that, what's the strategy?
[1:08:32.500 --> 1:08:34.500]  If you do this, that should probably do bestiality.
[1:08:34.500 --> 1:08:37.500]  Hey, the president's son is a crackhead,
[1:08:37.500 --> 1:08:39.500]  but to the smartest guy he noticed what your dad said.
[1:08:39.500 --> 1:08:42.500]  Is he the real president or a jack lead?
[1:08:42.500 --> 1:08:44.500]  Why is everyone that voted for your dad dead?
[1:08:44.500 --> 1:08:47.500]  Hey, you know what's really wild?
[1:08:47.500 --> 1:08:49.500]  Got your own son calling you a pedophile.
[1:08:49.500 --> 1:08:52.500]  Why you getting called that by your own child?
[1:08:52.500 --> 1:08:55.500]  In St. Peter Peter, every time I phone down, huh, wow.
[1:08:55.500 --> 1:08:57.500]  Hunter, are you in with hookers while they wearing crack?
[1:08:57.500 --> 1:09:00.500]  Whoa, they call it a conspiracy, but I'm saying facts, whoa.
[1:09:00.500 --> 1:09:02.500]  I'm matching up in Cali, but don't pay for that.
[1:09:02.500 --> 1:09:04.500]  Roll the media, don't cover it up like he ain't your dad.
[1:09:04.500 --> 1:09:07.500]  Whoa, all the women in your phone, can we check the age?
[1:09:07.500 --> 1:09:08.500]  Wasn't you on F10?
[1:09:08.500 --> 1:09:09.500]  Now look, can we check the pay?
[1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:12.500]  Hunter needs to be in prison, pit him in the cage.
[1:09:12.500 --> 1:09:14.500]  I thought he was clean, see my head changes ways.
[1:09:14.500 --> 1:09:17.500]  And that ain't working for charisma, how he get a raise?
[1:09:17.500 --> 1:09:19.500]  10% for the big guy, who all getting paid?
[1:09:19.500 --> 1:09:21.500]  I still don't know why he recorded this at Blackmail.
[1:09:21.500 --> 1:09:24.500]  But do you really think any of them will go to jail?
[1:09:24.500 --> 1:09:26.500]  They say Tannock and all of them will go to hell.
[1:09:26.500 --> 1:09:29.500]  You a lame hunter and your daddy lame a swim.
[1:09:29.500 --> 1:09:31.500]  It's obvious, but if you blind and read it in braille,
[1:09:31.500 --> 1:09:33.500]  with a corruption of in, only time will tell.
[1:09:33.500 --> 1:09:35.500]  The president's son is a crackhead,
[1:09:35.500 --> 1:09:38.500]  but to the smartest guy he noticed what your dad said.
[1:09:38.500 --> 1:09:40.500]  Is he the real president or a jackalette?
[1:09:40.500 --> 1:09:43.500]  Why is everyone that voted for your dad dead?
[1:09:43.500 --> 1:09:45.500]  Hey, you know what's really wild?
[1:09:45.500 --> 1:09:48.500]  Got your own son calling you a pedophile.
[1:09:48.500 --> 1:09:50.500]  Why you getting called that by your own child?
[1:09:50.500 --> 1:09:52.500]  They say pay to Peter every time to phone down.
[1:09:52.500 --> 1:09:55.500]  Wow, Hunter, are you in with hookers while they wearing crack?
[1:09:55.500 --> 1:09:58.500]  Whoa, they call it a conspiracy, but I'm saying facts, whoa.
[1:09:58.500 --> 1:10:00.500]  In a mansion up in Cali, but don't pay for that.
[1:10:00.500 --> 1:10:03.500]  Whoa, the media don't cover it up like he ain't your head.
[1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:05.500]  Whoa.
[1:10:05.500 --> 1:10:07.500]  Wow.
[1:10:07.500 --> 1:10:09.500]  Wow is all I can say.
[1:10:09.500 --> 1:10:12.500]  Bryson Gray made my day.
[1:10:12.500 --> 1:10:16.500]  Whoo. I gotta say, Roger Stone, it's fun fighting for freedom.
[1:10:16.500 --> 1:10:18.500]  I smell victory.
[1:10:18.500 --> 1:10:20.500]  The Democratic Party is destroying itself right now.
[1:10:20.500 --> 1:10:23.500]  We're gonna cover the January 6th show trial, the fiasco,
[1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:25.500]  the lies, the insanity right now.
[1:10:25.500 --> 1:10:28.500]  But Roger Stone, just look at the big picture right now.
[1:10:28.500 --> 1:10:31.500]  House team humanity doing right now against team Damon.
[1:10:31.500 --> 1:10:33.500]  They have nothing else.
[1:10:33.500 --> 1:10:38.500]  January 6th, we see the collapse of America, record gasoline prices,
[1:10:38.500 --> 1:10:42.500]  food shortages, crippling inflation,
[1:10:42.500 --> 1:10:47.500]  humiliation in our foreign policy around the globe,
[1:10:47.500 --> 1:10:50.500]  leaving billions on the field in Afghanistan,
[1:10:50.500 --> 1:10:54.500]  along with the blood of 13 Americans.
[1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:58.500]  Our southern border being flooded with crime,
[1:10:58.500 --> 1:11:02.500]  with fentanyl, with drugs, with human trafficking,
[1:11:02.500 --> 1:11:06.500]  while our government stands back and does nothing.
[1:11:06.500 --> 1:11:10.500]  These aren't just wrong-headed policies, Alex.
[1:11:10.500 --> 1:11:12.500]  This is the plan.
[1:11:12.500 --> 1:11:17.500]  And now, unless they can figure out some way to postpone or delay
[1:11:17.500 --> 1:11:23.500]  the November election, it is almost over for the ruling elite,
[1:11:23.500 --> 1:11:28.500]  for the globalist elite that seek nothing less
[1:11:28.500 --> 1:11:32.500]  than to completely extinguish the U.S. Constitution
[1:11:32.500 --> 1:11:35.500]  and destroy the American people.
[1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:38.500]  It's the end of the line for these people, but that's my next question.
[1:11:38.500 --> 1:11:40.500]  They're not gonna give up.
[1:11:40.500 --> 1:11:42.500]  What do you expect them to pull out of their rabbits hat there?
[1:11:42.500 --> 1:11:45.500]  January 6th thing is collapse with record low ratings,
[1:11:45.500 --> 1:11:47.500]  a dead cat bounces way above these people.
[1:11:47.500 --> 1:11:50.500]  What do you think they're gonna pull next?
[1:11:50.500 --> 1:11:54.500]  Well, I saw an excellent discussion
[1:11:54.500 --> 1:11:58.500]  between Julie Kelly and Lee Smith the other day,
[1:11:58.500 --> 1:12:02.500]  in which they spoke about the October surprise
[1:12:02.500 --> 1:12:07.500]  of the potential arrest of Donald Trump on, pardon the expression,
[1:12:07.500 --> 1:12:10.500]  Trump upcharges of some kind,
[1:12:10.500 --> 1:12:15.500]  probably based on the KKK law passed in the 1870s
[1:12:15.500 --> 1:12:19.500]  that would eliminate him as a contender.
[1:12:19.500 --> 1:12:23.500]  Contrary to the front page of yesterday's New York Times,
[1:12:23.500 --> 1:12:26.500]  Trump is actually gaining strength.
[1:12:26.500 --> 1:12:29.500]  The poll, the New York Times, the Seattle poll,
[1:12:29.500 --> 1:12:32.500]  they featured is an outlier.
[1:12:32.500 --> 1:12:37.500]  Two more authoritative polls out today show the American people
[1:12:37.500 --> 1:12:41.500]  want Donald Trump in the robust economy,
[1:12:41.500 --> 1:12:46.500]  in the strong national defense and a forthright foreign policy
[1:12:46.500 --> 1:12:51.500]  and the prosperity that he brought this country back.
[1:12:51.500 --> 1:12:53.500]  Absolutely, that's what I see.
[1:12:53.500 --> 1:12:56.500]  So, again, how do they grab victory from the jaws of defeat?
[1:12:56.500 --> 1:12:59.500]  False flags, election fraud, nobody's gonna buy it.
[1:12:59.500 --> 1:13:02.500]  What are these corner rats gonna do?
[1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:04.500]  Well, you had a little bit of footage there shortly,
[1:13:04.500 --> 1:13:09.500]  which I subscribed to, which is another fabricated pandemic,
[1:13:09.500 --> 1:13:13.500]  one that would allow Joe Biden to sign an executive order,
[1:13:13.500 --> 1:13:16.500]  eliminating all in-person voting,
[1:13:16.500 --> 1:13:19.500]  insisting that all voting would be...
[1:13:19.500 --> 1:13:21.500]  And you predicted that months ago.
[1:13:21.500 --> 1:13:24.500]  They're now floating that. This is now official.
[1:13:24.500 --> 1:13:27.500]  Yeah, there is more and more of it.
[1:13:27.500 --> 1:13:31.500]  Combine that with some bogus criminal indictment
[1:13:31.500 --> 1:13:34.500]  of the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln,
[1:13:34.500 --> 1:13:38.500]  and perhaps they think that is the path to victory.
[1:13:38.500 --> 1:13:43.500]  Yesterday's Kabuki Theater in the January 6th hearing
[1:13:43.500 --> 1:13:45.500]  was really quite extraordinary.
[1:13:45.500 --> 1:13:48.500]  By the way, you looked very handsome there.
[1:13:48.500 --> 1:13:52.500]  I must say, you looked great.
[1:13:52.500 --> 1:13:55.500]  I say that in a non-gay way, of course.
[1:13:55.500 --> 1:13:58.500]  The point is that Rolling Stone,
[1:13:58.500 --> 1:14:02.500]  National Public Radio The New York Times, The Washington Post,
[1:14:02.500 --> 1:14:05.500]  The Daily Beast, this was gonna be the moment
[1:14:05.500 --> 1:14:10.500]  that it was proven that Roger Stone was the link
[1:14:10.500 --> 1:14:13.500]  between the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers
[1:14:13.500 --> 1:14:15.500]  and the Trump White House,
[1:14:15.500 --> 1:14:19.500]  and of course they produced no evidence of that whatsoever.
[1:14:19.500 --> 1:14:23.500]  Instead, false witnesses that you met with Mark Meadows,
[1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:26.500]  you met him once years ago, never talked to him on the phone,
[1:14:26.500 --> 1:14:29.500]  didn't meet with him anywhere around January 6th.
[1:14:29.500 --> 1:14:31.500]  They've recycled that one twice.
[1:14:31.500 --> 1:14:33.500]  It was in a report a couple months ago.
[1:14:33.500 --> 1:14:35.500]  This woman, Cassidy Hutchison,
[1:14:35.500 --> 1:14:37.500]  I think she perjured herself,
[1:14:37.500 --> 1:14:41.500]  although the way the question was worded is clearly hearsay.
[1:14:41.500 --> 1:14:45.500]  But no, there was no phone call from Mark Meadows to me
[1:14:45.500 --> 1:14:49.500]  or to General Flynn, because I checked with General Flynn
[1:14:49.500 --> 1:14:53.500]  on the 5th to, as Liz Cheney put it,
[1:14:53.500 --> 1:14:56.500]  find out what was going to happen on the 6th,
[1:14:56.500 --> 1:14:58.500]  as if I would know.
[1:14:58.500 --> 1:15:02.500]  Nor did I visit any kind of war room in the Willard.
[1:15:02.500 --> 1:15:05.500]  I was in your studio in the Willard,
[1:15:05.500 --> 1:15:09.500]  which was set up as a studio where you interviewed General Flynn.
[1:15:09.500 --> 1:15:11.500]  And Alex, you may not remember this.
[1:15:11.500 --> 1:15:14.500]  That's the first time I ever actually met the general.
[1:15:14.500 --> 1:15:18.500]  Prior to that, all of our conversations had been by phone
[1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:21.500]  or through text, because we were tried
[1:15:21.500 --> 1:15:25.500]  by the same band of criminals in the same DC courthouse.
[1:15:25.500 --> 1:15:30.500]  So if there's a Willard war room, I was certainly not in it.
[1:15:30.500 --> 1:15:34.500]  Their entire tissue of lies yesterday fell apart.
[1:15:34.500 --> 1:15:37.500]  But what's amazing is the way they take things
[1:15:37.500 --> 1:15:39.500]  that I myself have announced and acknowledged
[1:15:39.500 --> 1:15:41.500]  and try to make them nefarious.
[1:15:41.500 --> 1:15:46.500]  Sadly, it is the state of affairs in America today
[1:15:46.500 --> 1:15:49.500]  that I can't travel anyplace.
[1:15:49.500 --> 1:15:50.500]  Roger, stay there.
[1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:52.500]  We're going to come back and ask what's coming next.
[1:15:52.500 --> 1:15:53.500]  Roger Stone is our guest.
[1:15:53.500 --> 1:15:54.500]  infowars.com.
[1:15:54.500 --> 1:15:56.500]  Stay with us.
[1:15:56.500 --> 1:16:00.500]  7 months ago, in December of 2021,
[1:16:00.500 --> 1:16:04.500]  we launched the first in the three-coin founding member series,
[1:16:04.500 --> 1:16:06.500]  George Washington, Slaying the Dragon.
[1:16:06.500 --> 1:16:08.500]  Then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin.
[1:16:08.500 --> 1:16:12.500]  And finally, the Second Amendment comment-ticket Molan Labe coin.
[1:16:12.500 --> 1:16:18.500]  There are only 75 points left in the three-point series,
[1:16:18.500 --> 1:16:23.500]  exclusively right now at 1776point.com.
[1:16:23.500 --> 1:16:27.500]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members
[1:16:27.500 --> 1:16:29.500]  for this big project we're launching in the near future,
[1:16:29.500 --> 1:16:32.500]  you'll also get a personal signed piece of art
[1:16:32.500 --> 1:16:36.500]  I made of the sheepdog chasing the wolf in a personal message.
[1:16:36.500 --> 1:16:42.500]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776point.com.
[1:16:42.500 --> 1:16:44.500]  This is history happening now.
[1:16:44.500 --> 1:16:47.500]  Infowars, thanks for your support, is changing the world.
[1:16:47.500 --> 1:16:52.500]  And this is the final 75 three-coin set, exclusively available
[1:16:52.500 --> 1:16:57.500]  at 1776point.com.
[1:16:57.500 --> 1:17:01.500]  We brought the game-changing product, previously only available
[1:17:01.500 --> 1:17:03.500]  to major oil companies around the world,
[1:17:03.500 --> 1:17:06.500]  to the civilian market two years ago, the Biopros.
[1:17:06.500 --> 1:17:10.500]  For septic tanks, for porta-potties, for RVs, for your drains,
[1:17:10.500 --> 1:17:12.500]  your boats, it goes on and on.
[1:17:12.500 --> 1:17:15.500]  It'll eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water.
[1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:20.500]  But it's been so successful now, we're selling it to major RV parks,
[1:17:20.500 --> 1:17:25.500]  pig farms, you name it, because this stuff will eat anything
[1:17:25.500 --> 1:17:27.500]  that is organic.
[1:17:27.500 --> 1:17:31.500]  And it's exclusively available at TheBiopros.com
[1:17:31.500 --> 1:17:33.500]  and now Infowars.com.
[1:17:33.500 --> 1:17:38.500]  We sold out of this for almost a year, but we made a major purchase
[1:17:38.500 --> 1:17:42.500]  and it is now in stock for whatever your need is at Infowars.com.
[1:17:42.500 --> 1:17:45.500]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information
[1:17:45.500 --> 1:17:49.500]  at Infowars.com or TheBiopros.com.
[1:17:49.500 --> 1:17:53.500]  Made America, powered by God's great creation.
[1:17:53.500 --> 1:18:22.500]  It is amazing and it funds the Infowars.
[1:18:24.500 --> 1:18:26.500]  Infowars.com is where to get them, folks.
[1:18:26.500 --> 1:18:28.500]  And we do have the best supplements.
[1:18:28.500 --> 1:18:31.500]  I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage
[1:18:31.500 --> 1:18:37.500]  and our information, we do the best with our supplements as well.
[1:18:37.500 --> 1:18:39.500]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[1:18:39.500 --> 1:18:41.500]  Folks, this is a joke.
[1:18:41.500 --> 1:18:42.500]  I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[1:18:42.500 --> 1:18:43.500]  It's 75% off.
[1:18:43.500 --> 1:18:45.500]  By the way, it works for me.
[1:18:45.500 --> 1:18:50.500]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[1:18:50.500 --> 1:18:52.500]  Quite well, I might add.
[1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:53.500]  Quite well.
[1:18:53.500 --> 1:18:56.500]  My barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[1:18:56.500 --> 1:18:58.500]  I go and see them quite often now.
[1:18:58.500 --> 1:19:01.500]  The National Suisse's new film, 2000 Mules,
[1:19:01.500 --> 1:19:03.500]  is the most important documentary in modern times
[1:19:03.500 --> 1:19:07.500]  because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election
[1:19:07.500 --> 1:19:09.500]  and how they're planning to steal future elections
[1:19:09.500 --> 1:19:12.500]  and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
[1:19:12.500 --> 1:19:13.500]  Now, it's great that it's online.
[1:19:13.500 --> 1:19:15.500]  It's great that millions watch it online.
[1:19:15.500 --> 1:19:19.500]  But you need to have the high quality HD DVD in your library
[1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:22.500]  with the expanded extras so it can't be censored in the future
[1:19:22.500 --> 1:19:25.500]  and so you can show it to everyone you know.
[1:19:25.500 --> 1:19:29.500]  Go to infowarstore.com and get 2000 Mules today
[1:19:29.500 --> 1:19:33.500]  and get it discounted up to 30% off when you get it with other documentary films
[1:19:33.500 --> 1:19:36.500]  like in-game blueprint for global enslavement,
[1:19:36.500 --> 1:19:39.500]  the seminal classic that predicted the great reset,
[1:19:39.500 --> 1:19:43.500]  and of course, part one, part two, and now the new part three of COVIDland.
[1:19:43.500 --> 1:19:45.500]  Get them separate.
[1:19:45.500 --> 1:19:46.500]  Get them together.
[1:19:46.500 --> 1:19:48.500]  Massively discounted at infowarstore.com.
[1:19:48.500 --> 1:19:52.500]  But everyone needs to have 2000 Mules in their library
[1:19:52.500 --> 1:19:54.500]  so the globalists can't censor it.
[1:19:54.500 --> 1:20:19.500]  infowarstore.com to get 2000 Mules today.
[1:20:24.500 --> 1:20:27.500]  Freedom came my day one way.
[1:20:27.500 --> 1:20:31.500]  And Sheriff John Brown came to shoot me down.
[1:20:31.500 --> 1:20:33.500]  So I shot him.
[1:20:33.500 --> 1:20:37.500]  Sheriff John Brown always hated me
[1:20:37.500 --> 1:20:42.500]  for what I don't know.
[1:20:42.500 --> 1:20:47.500]  Every time that I plan a scene
[1:20:47.500 --> 1:20:50.500]  he said kill it before it grows.
[1:20:50.500 --> 1:20:52.500]  Yep, that's Klaus Schwab in the New World Order.
[1:20:52.500 --> 1:20:55.500]  Sheriff Jones, our guest, Pete Santelli coming up to analyze
[1:20:55.500 --> 1:20:58.500]  the criminal activity of this January 6th.
[1:20:58.500 --> 1:21:00.500]  They're claiming Trump talked to a witness,
[1:21:00.500 --> 1:21:02.500]  so he's tampering with witnesses.
[1:21:02.500 --> 1:21:04.500]  All they do is rig this thing.
[1:21:04.500 --> 1:21:05.500]  This is insane.
[1:21:05.500 --> 1:21:08.500]  But Roger, you're with me on July 1st,
[1:21:08.500 --> 1:21:11.500]  a few days before our nation's birthday,
[1:21:11.500 --> 1:21:14.500]  and you had obviously talked to somebody
[1:21:14.500 --> 1:21:17.500]  who's got his new airplane painted with American flag,
[1:21:17.500 --> 1:21:19.500]  and I talked to MTG.
[1:21:19.500 --> 1:21:21.500]  I talked to a couple other people in Congress.
[1:21:21.500 --> 1:21:23.500]  Yeah, we've talked to Trump.
[1:21:23.500 --> 1:21:25.500]  He plans to announce in July.
[1:21:25.500 --> 1:21:27.500]  He had said, I might do it as early as July 4th.
[1:21:27.500 --> 1:21:29.500]  I said the prediction is he may do it July 4th,
[1:21:29.500 --> 1:21:31.500]  but he's announcing in July.
[1:21:31.500 --> 1:21:34.500]  He made for tactical advantages
[1:21:34.500 --> 1:21:36.500]  or tactical flexibility, as you called it,
[1:21:36.500 --> 1:21:38.500]  change the date.
[1:21:38.500 --> 1:21:40.500]  But since that big story came out,
[1:21:40.500 --> 1:21:42.500]  can you add anything to that?
[1:21:42.500 --> 1:21:44.500]  Because obviously he's going to run again.
[1:21:44.500 --> 1:21:46.500]  They're politically trying to stop him.
[1:21:46.500 --> 1:21:48.500]  Doesn't it nix all this political prosecution?
[1:21:48.500 --> 1:21:52.500]  Is it going to close ahead and get it done?
[1:21:52.500 --> 1:21:54.500]  I don't think it nixes it, Alex,
[1:21:54.500 --> 1:21:57.500]  but I do think it puts it in the proper perspective
[1:21:57.500 --> 1:22:01.500]  that this is 100% a political witch hunt.
[1:22:01.500 --> 1:22:04.500]  There are some complicated legal issues
[1:22:04.500 --> 1:22:06.500]  pertaining to the Federal Election Commission,
[1:22:06.500 --> 1:22:10.500]  which Trump and his lawyers want to sort through.
[1:22:10.500 --> 1:22:12.500]  But when I asked him if he's going to run again,
[1:22:12.500 --> 1:22:15.500]  he said, and I quote, I want to do it.
[1:22:15.500 --> 1:22:17.500]  That was music to my ears.
[1:22:17.500 --> 1:22:21.500]  I still believe he is our strongest candidate.
[1:22:21.500 --> 1:22:24.500]  And yesterday, if you watch the hearing,
[1:22:24.500 --> 1:22:27.500]  they actually blurted out, maybe by mistake,
[1:22:27.500 --> 1:22:30.500]  but I don't think so, what this was all about.
[1:22:30.500 --> 1:22:34.500]  Jamie Raskin, who's quite a piece of work himself,
[1:22:34.500 --> 1:22:36.500]  asked one of the witnesses,
[1:22:36.500 --> 1:22:39.500]  well, how is all of this going to impact the next election?
[1:22:39.500 --> 1:22:41.500]  There it is, folks.
[1:22:41.500 --> 1:22:44.500]  That's what yesterday's hearing was all about.
[1:22:44.500 --> 1:22:47.500]  And whether it was Brad Pascal,
[1:22:47.500 --> 1:22:50.500]  who was fired by Donald Trump,
[1:22:50.500 --> 1:22:54.500]  or Katrina Pearson, who was fired by Donald Trump,
[1:22:54.500 --> 1:22:58.500]  and showing their text messages bad mopping the president
[1:22:58.500 --> 1:23:01.500]  without that important context,
[1:23:01.500 --> 1:23:05.500]  or whether it was the assertion
[1:23:05.500 --> 1:23:08.500]  that there was supposed to be another rally,
[1:23:08.500 --> 1:23:11.500]  which, as I understand it, there was a legal permit for
[1:23:11.500 --> 1:23:13.500]  on the side of the Capitol.
[1:23:13.500 --> 1:23:17.500]  They try to make this all sound nefarious.
[1:23:17.500 --> 1:23:20.500]  I don't think the American people are buying it.
[1:23:20.500 --> 1:23:23.500]  I think Trump is actually gaining strength,
[1:23:23.500 --> 1:23:26.500]  particularly when people go to the gas pumps,
[1:23:26.500 --> 1:23:28.500]  particularly when people go to the gross fuel.
[1:23:28.500 --> 1:23:29.500]  Well, exactly.
[1:23:29.500 --> 1:23:31.500]  All the numbers show that it's backfiring on them.
[1:23:31.500 --> 1:23:33.500]  They have national polls out showing people
[1:23:33.500 --> 1:23:34.500]  supported the insurrection.
[1:23:34.500 --> 1:23:36.500]  I didn't support that fiasco.
[1:23:36.500 --> 1:23:38.500]  I didn't support not getting a 10-day investigation
[1:23:38.500 --> 1:23:39.500]  that Senator Cruz was pushing.
[1:23:39.500 --> 1:23:41.500]  I thought it was a bad thing,
[1:23:41.500 --> 1:23:43.500]  to actually become a positive thing
[1:23:43.500 --> 1:23:45.500]  to be seen as part of January 6th.
[1:23:45.500 --> 1:23:47.500]  This is totally blown up in their face.
[1:23:47.500 --> 1:23:49.500]  And it's incredible, as I said,
[1:23:49.500 --> 1:23:52.500]  the way they take public information.
[1:23:52.500 --> 1:23:55.500]  Yes, I was required to use a security contingent
[1:23:55.500 --> 1:23:57.500]  from the Oathkeepers.
[1:23:57.500 --> 1:24:00.500]  That's because I can't travel without taking my life in my hands.
[1:24:00.500 --> 1:24:04.500]  And the DC police officers that I normally would use,
[1:24:04.500 --> 1:24:08.500]  off-duty officers, which I quite properly and legally used
[1:24:08.500 --> 1:24:10.500]  during my trial, were unavailable.
[1:24:10.500 --> 1:24:12.500]  That doesn't mean I had any information
[1:24:12.500 --> 1:24:17.500]  about illegal activities at the Capitol on January 6th.
[1:24:17.500 --> 1:24:20.500]  So just to kind of stick it in their ear one time.
[1:24:20.500 --> 1:24:23.500]  There is no email, no text message,
[1:24:23.500 --> 1:24:26.500]  no encrypted message, no phone call,
[1:24:26.500 --> 1:24:29.500]  no witness, and no documentary film footage
[1:24:29.500 --> 1:24:31.500]  that shows anything otherwise.
[1:24:31.500 --> 1:24:33.500]  But, Roger, you told me I'm tired of this.
[1:24:33.500 --> 1:24:34.500]  I'm exhausted.
[1:24:34.500 --> 1:24:35.500]  I don't want to go to DC.
[1:24:35.500 --> 1:24:36.500]  And I twisted your arm.
[1:24:36.500 --> 1:24:38.500]  And I'm not trying to belittle you,
[1:24:38.500 --> 1:24:40.500]  but you were not in command of anything.
[1:24:40.500 --> 1:24:41.500]  Neither was I.
[1:24:41.500 --> 1:24:43.500]  And we're not, oh, look, they say they weren't command.
[1:24:43.500 --> 1:24:45.500]  There was no command of control.
[1:24:45.500 --> 1:24:48.500]  We counted on the Capitol Police and Secret Service
[1:24:48.500 --> 1:24:50.500]  in DC's this giant place.
[1:24:50.500 --> 1:24:52.500]  We were just, you couldn't even get to the crowds
[1:24:52.500 --> 1:24:53.500]  to get to the ellipse.
[1:24:53.500 --> 1:24:55.500]  I mean, it's just preposterous.
[1:24:55.500 --> 1:24:59.500]  Well, as you know, I never left my hotel grounds on the 6th.
[1:24:59.500 --> 1:25:03.500]  But I did go there to give a speech.
[1:25:03.500 --> 1:25:05.500]  And I gave that speech.
[1:25:05.500 --> 1:25:07.500]  On the 5th, you spoke at the same venue.
[1:25:07.500 --> 1:25:10.500]  That's constitutionally protected free speech.
[1:25:10.500 --> 1:25:12.500]  You and I, and every American,
[1:25:12.500 --> 1:25:15.500]  have an absolute constitutional right
[1:25:15.500 --> 1:25:18.500]  to question the anomalies and irregularities
[1:25:18.500 --> 1:25:20.500]  in the American election.
[1:25:20.500 --> 1:25:21.500]  It's a God-given right.
[1:25:21.500 --> 1:25:22.500]  Roger, I totally agree.
[1:25:22.500 --> 1:25:23.500]  And our listeners know that.
[1:25:23.500 --> 1:25:25.500]  So let me ask you this.
[1:25:25.500 --> 1:25:28.500]  The ratings show it crashed.
[1:25:28.500 --> 1:25:30.500]  Literally almost no one's watching.
[1:25:30.500 --> 1:25:34.500]  Jill Biden saying Mexicans or tacos got 100,
[1:25:34.500 --> 1:25:37.500]  actually exactly 100 times the views.
[1:25:37.500 --> 1:25:39.500]  What are they going to do is that dawns on them
[1:25:39.500 --> 1:25:41.500]  that no one's buying what they've done
[1:25:41.500 --> 1:25:42.500]  and that it's backfiring?
[1:25:42.500 --> 1:25:44.500]  Or do they just keep doubling down?
[1:25:44.500 --> 1:25:46.500]  Well, I think they keep doubling down.
[1:25:46.500 --> 1:25:51.500]  I still believe, as if you saw this op-ed piece
[1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:53.500]  in yesterday's New York Times
[1:25:53.500 --> 1:25:57.500]  by the nefarious corrupt prosecutor Andrew Weisman,
[1:25:57.500 --> 1:26:01.500]  they are pushing hard for a criminal indictment of Donald Trump
[1:26:01.500 --> 1:26:05.500]  to negate his ability to run for president.
[1:26:05.500 --> 1:26:08.500]  I think that that is an internal struggle
[1:26:08.500 --> 1:26:11.500]  within the left at this point.
[1:26:11.500 --> 1:26:16.500]  Then, of course, there's a second pandemic of some kind
[1:26:16.500 --> 1:26:19.500]  which would limit us to mail-in voting.
[1:26:19.500 --> 1:26:22.500]  And let's be honest, Alex, in certain states,
[1:26:22.500 --> 1:26:25.500]  the same rules that were used to steal the last election
[1:26:25.500 --> 1:26:29.500]  are still in place and could be used to steal this election.
[1:26:29.500 --> 1:26:31.500]  So, for example, in Pennsylvania,
[1:26:31.500 --> 1:26:35.500]  where the Commonwealth courts have outruled mail-in ballots,
[1:26:35.500 --> 1:26:37.500]  saying they're unconstitutional,
[1:26:37.500 --> 1:26:40.500]  that's now before the left-leaning Supreme Court,
[1:26:40.500 --> 1:26:44.500]  which may uphold mail-in ballots,
[1:26:44.500 --> 1:26:48.500]  making a pivotal state virtually impossible to carry
[1:26:48.500 --> 1:26:51.500]  because of massive voter fraud.
[1:26:51.500 --> 1:26:53.500]  Roger, I could ask a thousand questions.
[1:26:53.500 --> 1:26:55.500]  We're coming up with Pete Santelli to analyze
[1:26:55.500 --> 1:26:56.500]  the fraud of this committee
[1:26:56.500 --> 1:26:58.500]  and how it's an attack on American jurisprudence
[1:26:58.500 --> 1:26:59.500]  in the process.
[1:26:59.500 --> 1:27:01.500]  But what else is on your radar screen?
[1:27:01.500 --> 1:27:05.500]  Well, Alex, my birthday is coming up, August 27th.
[1:27:05.500 --> 1:27:08.500]  That is the same day, of course, of Lyndon Johnson,
[1:27:08.500 --> 1:27:11.500]  the man I exposed in the murder of John F. Kennedy.
[1:27:11.500 --> 1:27:14.500]  And I'm thinking seriously about coming down to Austin
[1:27:14.500 --> 1:27:19.500]  so we can celebrate and I can have that big, thick, juicy steak
[1:27:19.500 --> 1:27:24.500]  that Owen Shroyer owes me from a past election bet.
[1:27:24.500 --> 1:27:25.500]  That's right.
[1:27:25.500 --> 1:27:27.500]  He predicted Trump would be able to defeat the election fraud.
[1:27:27.500 --> 1:27:29.500]  You said they were going to steal it from Trump.
[1:27:29.500 --> 1:27:31.500]  You predicted he would lose.
[1:27:31.500 --> 1:27:33.500]  Actually, it was an election before that.
[1:27:33.500 --> 1:27:36.500]  He predicted a control of both houses.
[1:27:36.500 --> 1:27:38.500]  Of course, he now thinks it was a tube steak.
[1:27:38.500 --> 1:27:40.500]  He thinks it was a hot dog.
[1:27:40.500 --> 1:27:42.500]  I think it was one of those huge tomahawks.
[1:27:42.500 --> 1:27:45.500]  But in any event, it would be great to be back in Austin.
[1:27:45.500 --> 1:27:48.500]  Maybe we can do some long-form journalism.
[1:27:48.500 --> 1:27:51.500]  I'm thinking seriously about coming your way for my birthday.
[1:27:51.500 --> 1:27:55.500]  We'd love it, Roger, and bring your wife, bring the whole crew.
[1:27:55.500 --> 1:27:57.500]  We're going to come back with Pete Santilli in use.
[1:27:57.500 --> 1:27:58.500]  So don't go away.
[1:27:58.500 --> 1:28:00.500]  You're definitely dressed for the occasion here.
[1:28:00.500 --> 1:28:02.500]  January 6th, we'll analyze it all.
[1:28:02.500 --> 1:28:07.500]  But in 50 seconds before a break, how do people get a great Roger Stone t-shirt?
[1:28:07.500 --> 1:28:09.500]  You've got the best designs out there.
[1:28:09.500 --> 1:28:14.500]  You can go to rogerstonesstore.com, rogerstonesstore.com.
[1:28:14.500 --> 1:28:16.500]  We've got some new designs up.
[1:28:16.500 --> 1:28:19.500]  But it's truer than ever before.
[1:28:19.500 --> 1:28:21.500]  The Roger Stone still did nothing wrong.
[1:28:21.500 --> 1:28:25.500]  The t-shirt is as valid today as the day it was designed.
[1:28:25.500 --> 1:28:27.500]  And we've got to stand behind folks like you,
[1:28:27.500 --> 1:28:29.500]  because you could have lied against Trump.
[1:28:29.500 --> 1:28:30.500]  They would have dropped the fake charges,
[1:28:30.500 --> 1:28:32.500]  but instead they convicted you in a kangaroo court.
[1:28:32.500 --> 1:28:35.500]  We're going to go to a COVID-ridden prison,
[1:28:35.500 --> 1:28:38.500]  and you didn't back down, so we salute Roger Stone.
[1:28:38.500 --> 1:28:41.500]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone and Pete Santilli
[1:28:41.500 --> 1:28:45.500]  to analyze this miscarriage of congressional misbehavior.

[1:30:58.500 --> 1:31:00.500]  The globalists are making their move.
[1:31:00.500 --> 1:31:01.500]  Their great reset is here.
[1:31:01.500 --> 1:31:03.500]  They're coming for your children.
[1:31:03.500 --> 1:31:05.500]  They're coming for the value of your currency.

[1:31:07.500 --> 1:31:12.500]  They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny.

[1:31:22.500 --> 1:31:24.500]  that you and your fellow Americans choose.
[1:31:24.500 --> 1:31:26.500]  The new film, the seminal film,

[1:32:04.500 --> 1:32:07.500]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent
[1:32:07.500 --> 1:32:10.500]  and override the censors has been patriot, apparel,
[1:32:10.500 --> 1:32:13.500]  so we can identify each other, so we can spread the word,
[1:32:13.500 --> 1:32:16.500]  and so we can push people to websites like infowars.com
[1:32:16.500 --> 1:32:19.500]  so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[1:32:19.500 --> 1:32:21.500]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced
[1:32:21.500 --> 1:32:24.500]  we're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts,
[1:32:24.500 --> 1:32:26.500]  some of which go back more than 25 years,
[1:32:26.500 --> 1:32:28.500]  all these shirts are limited edition,
[1:32:28.500 --> 1:32:30.500]  they are about to be history, and will only exist
[1:32:30.500 --> 1:32:33.500]  in your closet, your drawer, or your wardrobe.
[1:32:33.500 --> 1:32:36.500]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left.
[1:32:36.500 --> 1:32:39.500]  In a couple weeks they'll all be gone and they'll be history.
[1:32:39.500 --> 1:32:44.500]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarsstore.com.
[1:32:44.500 --> 1:32:46.500]  So thank you all for your support.

[1:32:59.500 --> 1:33:03.500]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:33:03.500 --> 1:33:25.500]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:25.500 --> 1:33:36.500]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:36.500 --> 1:33:42.500]  If you want a benchmark on how incredibly popular freedom is,
[1:33:42.500 --> 1:33:45.500]  it's only been on presale for six days,
[1:33:45.500 --> 1:33:49.500]  and Alex's war, an independent documentary about my 28 years on air,
[1:33:49.500 --> 1:33:55.500]  is now number three behind Jurassic Park and Top Gun on Apple presales.
[1:33:55.500 --> 1:34:01.500]  And in the next five days, those films will go on Apple sale,
[1:34:01.500 --> 1:34:03.500]  and so we will go to number one.
[1:34:03.500 --> 1:34:05.500]  That's a screenshot from yesterday.
[1:34:05.500 --> 1:34:07.500]  We are now not behind Justice League,
[1:34:07.500 --> 1:34:10.500]  we are now in the third position behind Top Gun and Jurassic Park.
[1:34:10.500 --> 1:34:13.500]  Hundreds of thousands of people have already preordered
[1:34:13.500 --> 1:34:17.500]  and no financial stuff to us, I wish it was, Alex's war.
[1:34:17.500 --> 1:34:19.500]  So all of its big corporate movies,
[1:34:19.500 --> 1:34:22.500]  the top hundred list is big Hollywood films,
[1:34:22.500 --> 1:34:25.500]  there is documentary film about what we really stand for
[1:34:25.500 --> 1:34:28.500]  in the number three position on Apple,
[1:34:28.500 --> 1:34:30.500]  and that's the first place it's been offered.
[1:34:30.500 --> 1:34:32.500]  So this is going to be huge when you slither by this,
[1:34:32.500 --> 1:34:35.500]  going and preordering the film that comes out on the 29th of July
[1:34:35.500 --> 1:34:40.500]  in just about two weeks, exactly two weeks from now.
[1:34:40.500 --> 1:34:43.500]  Separately, we can't stay on air without your support,
[1:34:43.500 --> 1:34:45.500]  and I thank you for your support.
[1:34:45.500 --> 1:34:47.500]  This is right T-shirt, infowarstore.com,
[1:34:47.500 --> 1:34:49.500]  and we have bodies, ultimate turmeric formula,
[1:34:49.500 --> 1:34:53.500]  95% of humanoid, the other highest quality one has 75%.
[1:34:53.500 --> 1:34:55.500]  We went to the top lab and said,
[1:34:55.500 --> 1:34:56.500]  why has nobody ever done this?
[1:34:56.500 --> 1:34:57.500]  They said, nobody ever goes that high.
[1:34:57.500 --> 1:35:01.500]  The average turmeric is raw, and it's 5%.
[1:35:01.500 --> 1:35:02.500]  And it works great.
[1:35:02.500 --> 1:35:05.500]  This is 95% for your libido, your stamina,
[1:35:05.500 --> 1:35:08.500]  your immune system, your joints, anti-cancer, everything.
[1:35:08.500 --> 1:35:10.500]  This is an incredible product.
[1:35:10.500 --> 1:35:13.500]  Back in stock, finally sold out for seven months,
[1:35:13.500 --> 1:35:17.500]  infowarstore.com, bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[1:35:17.500 --> 1:35:19.500]  I want to thank you all for your support
[1:35:19.500 --> 1:35:22.500]  and keeping us on air.
[1:35:22.500 --> 1:35:24.500]  All right, for the balance of the hour,
[1:35:24.500 --> 1:35:27.500]  former political prisoner Pete Santelli,
[1:35:27.500 --> 1:35:30.500]  who they had to release from jail when they had to mistrial him,
[1:35:30.500 --> 1:35:33.500]  for as a journalist covering the Bundy Ranch
[1:35:33.500 --> 1:35:38.500]  and then the situation that also happened on the East Coast
[1:35:38.500 --> 1:35:40.500]  in Oregon and Washington,
[1:35:40.500 --> 1:35:45.500]  and he is with us because he is a real sleuth
[1:35:45.500 --> 1:35:47.500]  when it comes to understanding what's happening
[1:35:47.500 --> 1:35:52.500]  and how just unprecedentedly corrupt this January 6th community is.
[1:35:52.500 --> 1:35:56.500]  Because listen, if they can hold 300, 400 people without trials
[1:35:56.500 --> 1:35:57.500]  and in solitary confinement,
[1:35:57.500 --> 1:35:59.500]  if they can set up American gulags
[1:35:59.500 --> 1:36:01.500]  that would make Alexander Schultz an ancient blush,
[1:36:01.500 --> 1:36:04.500]  if they can get away with this,
[1:36:04.500 --> 1:36:07.500]  they admit it's a blueprint for all of us.
[1:36:07.500 --> 1:36:11.500]  So the prisoners, the Stuart Rhodes and the Joe Biggs
[1:36:11.500 --> 1:36:14.500]  are totally innocent, but even if they were guilty,
[1:36:14.500 --> 1:36:18.500]  it's better that one guilty man go free
[1:36:18.500 --> 1:36:21.500]  than the rest of the public be enslaved to this tyranny.
[1:36:21.500 --> 1:36:23.500]  It's better that 100 guilty men go free
[1:36:23.500 --> 1:36:24.500]  than one innocent man go free,
[1:36:24.500 --> 1:36:28.500]  but this is one guilty man go free versus thousands of innocents,
[1:36:28.500 --> 1:36:29.500]  but they are not even guilty.
[1:36:29.500 --> 1:36:33.500]  So it is insane what's been happening and watching this
[1:36:33.500 --> 1:36:36.500]  and how they have oathkeepers that have pled guilty
[1:36:36.500 --> 1:36:39.500]  to not get sentences testifying in there with no evidence
[1:36:39.500 --> 1:36:42.500]  that this kangaroo event is absolutely out of control.
[1:36:42.500 --> 1:36:45.500]  I want to go to Pete Santilli here in just a moment,
[1:36:45.500 --> 1:36:47.500]  but first, Roger, you're going to be with us for the rest of the hour,
[1:36:47.500 --> 1:36:53.500]  but just watching this and your take on this
[1:36:53.500 --> 1:36:56.500]  and it backfiring, what do you think they do next?
[1:36:56.500 --> 1:36:59.500]  Well, first of all, I'm really glad to see Pete Santilli here
[1:36:59.500 --> 1:37:01.500]  on the Alex Jones show.
[1:37:01.500 --> 1:37:04.500]  When I went to work at InfoWars several years ago,
[1:37:04.500 --> 1:37:06.500]  you guys had falling out.
[1:37:06.500 --> 1:37:07.500]  You weren't on speaking terms.
[1:37:07.500 --> 1:37:09.500]  You're both great patriots.
[1:37:09.500 --> 1:37:13.500]  History can bestow no greater title than peacemaker,
[1:37:13.500 --> 1:37:16.500]  so I'm really glad to see you guys back together again
[1:37:16.500 --> 1:37:19.500]  because we're all on the same side of freedom.
[1:37:19.500 --> 1:37:24.500]  And Pete Santilli is one of the best investigative journalists
[1:37:24.500 --> 1:37:25.500]  in the country today.
[1:37:25.500 --> 1:37:28.500]  By the way, Alex, I'll be on the Pete Santilli show tonight
[1:37:28.500 --> 1:37:33.500]  at 615 at frankspeech.com and honored to be there.
[1:37:33.500 --> 1:37:35.500]  I want to hear what Pete has to say
[1:37:35.500 --> 1:37:40.500]  because his analysis of the maneuverings of the deep state
[1:37:40.500 --> 1:37:43.500]  are better than perhaps anybody else out there.
[1:37:43.500 --> 1:37:46.500]  He's lived it. He's been through it as I have,
[1:37:46.500 --> 1:37:49.500]  and what they've tried to do to you, Alex,
[1:37:49.500 --> 1:37:51.500]  but I want to hear what Pete has to say.
[1:37:51.500 --> 1:37:53.500]  Absolutely. You've been through the fire, Pete.
[1:37:53.500 --> 1:37:55.500]  You're one of the top experts on this.
[1:37:55.500 --> 1:37:57.500]  What's really going on?
[1:37:57.500 --> 1:38:00.500]  Very quickly, I have to say that it was InfoWars,
[1:38:00.500 --> 1:38:04.500]  Roger Stone's coverage at a time when we needed it most,
[1:38:04.500 --> 1:38:06.500]  because in the court of public opinion,
[1:38:06.500 --> 1:38:12.500]  this railroading of us Bundy defendants back in 2016 and 17,
[1:38:12.500 --> 1:38:16.500]  if we did not have the public support and the information
[1:38:16.500 --> 1:38:19.500]  reaching the public as to how we were being railroaded
[1:38:19.500 --> 1:38:22.500]  and entrapped by the same regime back then.
[1:38:22.500 --> 1:38:24.500]  And I'm not going to rehash old news.
[1:38:24.500 --> 1:38:28.500]  I'm just going to tell you that my 619 days being held
[1:38:28.500 --> 1:38:30.500]  as a political prisoner,
[1:38:30.500 --> 1:38:32.500]  it prepared me for what I'm about to bring today.
[1:38:32.500 --> 1:38:36.500]  And I know they transcribe every single word spoken on the InfoWars.
[1:38:36.500 --> 1:38:38.500]  Shall we see it on the Jumbotron now?
[1:38:38.500 --> 1:38:40.500]  Every single hearing.
[1:38:40.500 --> 1:38:44.500]  And I have a unique opportunity now after exposing them
[1:38:44.500 --> 1:38:46.500]  and winning in two federal trials,
[1:38:46.500 --> 1:38:48.500]  understanding their methodology,
[1:38:48.500 --> 1:38:52.500]  that this cabal under the Obama regime
[1:38:52.500 --> 1:38:57.500]  that perpetrated this attack upon a small group of Americans
[1:38:57.500 --> 1:39:00.500]  for political reasons, to silence Clive and Bundy,
[1:39:00.500 --> 1:39:02.500]  they wanted to extract the wealth out of the land,
[1:39:02.500 --> 1:39:06.500]  but they employ the same exact tactics as they're doing right now.
[1:39:06.500 --> 1:39:09.500]  That was a practice run for what happened
[1:39:09.500 --> 1:39:12.500]  on after November 3rd for that matter.
[1:39:12.500 --> 1:39:14.500]  But let me start off by saying this.
[1:39:14.500 --> 1:39:17.500]  What we saw yesterday, you know what they say?
[1:39:17.500 --> 1:39:20.500]  Once you open the door in a court of law,
[1:39:20.500 --> 1:39:23.500]  you may be prohibited from bringing up things
[1:39:23.500 --> 1:39:26.500]  that may be irrelevant or conspiracy theories.
[1:39:26.500 --> 1:39:30.500]  And I've been theorizing about some of the infiltrators
[1:39:30.500 --> 1:39:33.500]  and the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys
[1:39:33.500 --> 1:39:37.500]  and how the FBI ran their operations
[1:39:37.500 --> 1:39:42.500]  to entrap Americans back in 2014 and 2016.
[1:39:42.500 --> 1:39:44.500]  So I was theorizing.
[1:39:44.500 --> 1:39:46.500]  The same group that did the Whitmer fake kidnapping
[1:39:46.500 --> 1:39:48.500]  now exposing confirmed to be a false flag
[1:39:48.500 --> 1:39:50.500]  was running January 6th.
[1:39:50.500 --> 1:39:52.500]  Yeah, I'll tell you very quickly.
[1:39:52.500 --> 1:39:54.500]  We're limited in time.
[1:39:54.500 --> 1:39:57.500]  They got caught on full display right now.
[1:39:57.500 --> 1:40:00.500]  There were two quote unquote key witnesses
[1:40:00.500 --> 1:40:01.500]  that were giving testimony.
[1:40:01.500 --> 1:40:04.500]  And I'll start with one of them, Mr. Ayers.
[1:40:04.500 --> 1:40:07.500]  He was the guy with the reddish beard.
[1:40:07.500 --> 1:40:11.500]  He is a defendant, a January 6th defendant.
[1:40:11.500 --> 1:40:13.500]  And I did some searching this morning.
[1:40:13.500 --> 1:40:14.500]  I just discovered this.
[1:40:14.500 --> 1:40:18.500]  I said, that testimony sounds awfully scripted
[1:40:18.500 --> 1:40:20.500]  and in favor of the narrative.
[1:40:20.500 --> 1:40:22.500]  I said, I wonder what's going on with him.
[1:40:22.500 --> 1:40:25.500]  He's a defendant. I polled his docket
[1:40:25.500 --> 1:40:28.500]  and I looked at his cooperative agreement.
[1:40:28.500 --> 1:40:30.500]  He just signed on June 8th,
[1:40:30.500 --> 1:40:33.500]  which says that he agreed to a plea agreement,
[1:40:33.500 --> 1:40:35.500]  have all of his felony charges removed,
[1:40:35.500 --> 1:40:38.500]  and he agreed to cooperate with the government.
[1:40:38.500 --> 1:40:42.500]  And he hadn't had a sentencing yet or the sentencing memo.
[1:40:42.500 --> 1:40:44.500]  So essentially based on his cooperation,
[1:40:44.500 --> 1:40:47.500]  the value of that testimony and cooperation,
[1:40:47.500 --> 1:40:49.500]  they would determine,
[1:40:49.500 --> 1:40:51.500]  the judge would determine how to sentence him.
[1:40:51.500 --> 1:40:52.500]  Well, guess what?
[1:40:52.500 --> 1:40:55.500]  He shows up shortly after he signed this cooperative agreement
[1:40:55.500 --> 1:40:59.500]  and he puts on a Hollywood performance
[1:40:59.500 --> 1:41:01.500]  on behalf of the communists.
[1:41:01.500 --> 1:41:05.500]  Of course, Saigon, what's her name?
[1:41:05.500 --> 1:41:07.500]  Saigon, Suzy, whatever name, Murphy.
[1:41:07.500 --> 1:41:10.500]  She's working and has interest directly with this.
[1:41:10.500 --> 1:41:11.500]  And so that was incredible.
[1:41:11.500 --> 1:41:13.500]  You're in a show trial when you're facing sentencing.
[1:41:13.500 --> 1:41:15.500]  101, you can't do that.
[1:41:15.500 --> 1:41:17.500]  It's a total fraud.
[1:41:17.500 --> 1:41:20.500]  Let me tell you, and we'll get to this
[1:41:20.500 --> 1:41:21.500]  on the other side of the break.
[1:41:21.500 --> 1:41:24.500]  It would be normally egregious, of course, to do a show trial,
[1:41:24.500 --> 1:41:26.500]  especially pending all of these trials coming up
[1:41:26.500 --> 1:41:28.500]  for the January 6th defendants,
[1:41:28.500 --> 1:41:34.500]  to do that and to try this case in the legislature.
[1:41:34.500 --> 1:41:35.500]  Taints the jury.
[1:41:35.500 --> 1:41:37.500]  That's very, very graziers.
[1:41:37.500 --> 1:41:40.500]  Then to use what they did yesterday,
[1:41:40.500 --> 1:41:42.500]  two known operatives that are working
[1:41:42.500 --> 1:41:43.500]  on behalf of the government.
[1:41:43.500 --> 1:41:45.500]  This guy, Ayers, has assigned agreement,
[1:41:45.500 --> 1:41:47.500]  saying that he will cooperate.
[1:41:47.500 --> 1:41:51.500]  And basically, in exchange for his cooperation
[1:41:51.500 --> 1:41:53.500]  and his favorable testimony.
[1:41:53.500 --> 1:41:55.500]  They're holding him hostage, and then he's a witness.
[1:41:55.500 --> 1:41:57.500]  Yeah, well, guess what?
[1:41:57.500 --> 1:41:59.500]  The other guy, even worse now.
[1:41:59.500 --> 1:42:02.500]  This guy, Mr...
[1:42:02.500 --> 1:42:04.500]  I can't pronounce his last name
[1:42:04.500 --> 1:42:08.500]  because he was referred to something else back in 2014.
[1:42:08.500 --> 1:42:13.500]  Alex, this is pretty much an exclusive outside of my show.
[1:42:13.500 --> 1:42:15.500]  This guy, Mr. Tayton Hove,
[1:42:15.500 --> 1:42:18.500]  testified against Stuart Rhodes to bury him
[1:42:18.500 --> 1:42:20.500]  and create a scenario where you got so much pressure
[1:42:20.500 --> 1:42:23.500]  on Stuart Rhodes to bear false witness.
[1:42:23.500 --> 1:42:27.500]  Jason Tayton Hove was the producer of videos
[1:42:27.500 --> 1:42:31.500]  that showed up in my discovery in the Bundy trials
[1:42:31.500 --> 1:42:34.500]  because he was there in Bundy Ranch,
[1:42:34.500 --> 1:42:36.500]  in the room, in the war room,
[1:42:36.500 --> 1:42:40.500]  and he cooperated by providing his material to the FBI.
[1:42:40.500 --> 1:42:43.500]  So it's the same cast of characters or other setups.
[1:42:43.500 --> 1:42:44.500]  That's exactly right.
[1:42:44.500 --> 1:42:46.500]  We'll cover more on the other side.
[1:42:46.500 --> 1:42:48.500]  That's right. All right. Pete Santilli, Roger Stone.
[1:42:48.500 --> 1:42:49.500]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[1:42:49.500 --> 1:42:50.500]  We'll be right back.
[1:42:50.500 --> 1:42:53.500]  Infowars.com, Pamara's News Today,
[1:42:53.500 --> 1:43:15.500]  and Pete Santilli, ThePeteSantilliShow.com.
[1:43:23.500 --> 1:43:30.500]  We'll be right back.
[1:43:53.500 --> 1:43:58.500]  This is amazing, and it funds the Infowars.
[1:44:24.500 --> 1:44:28.500]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful
[1:44:28.500 --> 1:44:30.500]  for a variety of health conditions,
[1:44:30.500 --> 1:44:32.500]  including those with osteoarthritis
[1:44:32.500 --> 1:44:35.500]  and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[1:44:35.500 --> 1:44:37.500]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves,
[1:44:37.500 --> 1:44:40.500]  you probably already know that they play an important role
[1:44:40.500 --> 1:44:42.500]  in nutrition, immune defense,
[1:44:42.500 --> 1:44:44.500]  and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:44:44.500 --> 1:44:48.500]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate,
[1:44:48.500 --> 1:44:51.500]  even in affluent populations like here in America.
[1:44:51.500 --> 1:44:53.500]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out
[1:44:53.500 --> 1:44:58.500]  at InfowarsStore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[1:44:58.500 --> 1:45:03.500]  Taking advantage of one of nature's most nutrient-dense ingredients,

[1:45:23.500 --> 1:45:26.500]  and antioxidants you want to help support a healthy liver,

[1:45:33.500 --> 1:45:35.500]  Don't overlook the power of beetroot.

[1:46:19.500 --> 1:46:21.500]  I want that good will.
[1:46:21.500 --> 1:46:23.500]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[1:46:23.500 --> 1:46:25.500]  Don't you get the big secret?
[1:46:25.500 --> 1:46:27.500]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[1:46:27.500 --> 1:46:29.500]  No, you never seen that, have you?
[1:46:29.500 --> 1:46:37.500]  And this little jewel right here is solid, liquid consciousness.
[1:46:40.500 --> 1:46:41.500]  Look it up.
[1:46:41.500 --> 1:46:46.500]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admit
[1:46:46.500 --> 1:46:47.500]  fish oil is incredible.
[1:46:47.500 --> 1:46:49.500]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves
[1:46:49.500 --> 1:46:52.500]  is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[1:46:52.500 --> 1:46:54.500]  Just like our information's dynamite,
[1:46:54.500 --> 1:47:20.500]  so are our products in 4store.com.
[1:47:24.500 --> 1:47:28.500]  Now look, I'm going to show TV viewers this number from Google
[1:47:28.500 --> 1:47:30.500]  that the Republican Party put out.
[1:47:30.500 --> 1:47:31.500]  I checked it myself.
[1:47:31.500 --> 1:47:34.500]  It's actually worse than this if you follow the full trend.
[1:47:34.500 --> 1:47:40.500]  There is not 200,000 viewers on all the networks covering this.
[1:47:40.500 --> 1:47:45.500]  That is beyond a flat line.
[1:47:45.500 --> 1:47:52.500]  Jill Biden and Taco Comment had 100 times.
[1:47:52.500 --> 1:47:54.500]  Exactly, look at that.
[1:47:54.500 --> 1:48:01.500]  100 times the viewers and searches that they had in blue down there.
[1:48:01.500 --> 1:48:07.500]  That's the Gen 6 community right here.
[1:48:07.500 --> 1:48:09.500]  People say, why are you covering it?
[1:48:09.500 --> 1:48:12.500]  Because their whole shooting match is based on that.
[1:48:12.500 --> 1:48:15.500]  You add the Hunter laptop.
[1:48:15.500 --> 1:48:17.500]  I've got the numbers right here.
[1:48:17.500 --> 1:48:22.500]  It's way, way above the Jill Biden searches
[1:48:22.500 --> 1:48:24.500]  by an order of magnitude.
[1:48:24.500 --> 1:48:25.500]  I've got those.
[1:48:25.500 --> 1:48:29.500]  So what are they going to do when they don't have control
[1:48:29.500 --> 1:48:34.500]  of the narrative at any level?
[1:48:34.500 --> 1:48:37.500]  And why do they keep going ahead with this?
[1:48:37.500 --> 1:48:39.500]  They've got a plan to outlaw their opposition.
[1:48:39.500 --> 1:48:40.500]  They admit that.
[1:48:40.500 --> 1:48:43.500]  So I want to go back to Pete Santilli, but Roger Stone.
[1:48:43.500 --> 1:48:45.500]  I know they're a bunch of lawyers.
[1:48:45.500 --> 1:48:48.500]  I know they're not that smart, but what is their problem?
[1:48:48.500 --> 1:48:51.500]  I mean, don't they get there's revolutions
[1:48:51.500 --> 1:48:53.500]  overthrowing governments everywhere?
[1:48:53.500 --> 1:48:54.500]  And the polls are out.
[1:48:54.500 --> 1:48:55.500]  I showed them yesterday.
[1:48:55.500 --> 1:48:57.500]  People wanted us to overthrow the government.
[1:48:57.500 --> 1:48:58.500]  We didn't do that.
[1:48:58.500 --> 1:48:59.500]  They're pissed.
[1:48:59.500 --> 1:49:00.500]  We didn't.
[1:49:00.500 --> 1:49:02.500]  My audience is pissed that I was against violence.
[1:49:02.500 --> 1:49:03.500]  I'm helping to be honest.
[1:49:03.500 --> 1:49:09.500]  Like, they're literally trying to make us look bad
[1:49:09.500 --> 1:49:11.500]  for not trying to overthrow the government violently
[1:49:11.500 --> 1:49:13.500]  when they overthrow it by fraud.
[1:49:13.500 --> 1:49:16.500]  When the people actually wanted us to do that.
[1:49:16.500 --> 1:49:19.500]  So I don't think they know how much trouble
[1:49:19.500 --> 1:49:20.500]  they're in.
[1:49:20.500 --> 1:49:21.500]  Roger Stone.
[1:49:21.500 --> 1:49:24.500]  I think they're stuck with this narrative.
[1:49:24.500 --> 1:49:28.500]  Alex, look, as you know, if you elect in any proceeding,
[1:49:28.500 --> 1:49:30.500]  by the way, this isn't a legal proceeding.
[1:49:30.500 --> 1:49:33.500]  It's a political proceeding to invoke your Fifth Amendment
[1:49:33.500 --> 1:49:36.500]  rights because you can smell a perjury trap.
[1:49:36.500 --> 1:49:39.500]  Well, then you have to use your Fifth Amendment rights
[1:49:39.500 --> 1:49:41.500]  to every single question.
[1:49:41.500 --> 1:49:44.500]  You don't get to allow to answer some questions
[1:49:44.500 --> 1:49:46.500]  and plead the Fifth on others.
[1:49:46.500 --> 1:49:50.500]  Yet, they willfully showed a video of General Michael Flynn
[1:49:50.500 --> 1:49:52.500]  being asked the ridiculous question,
[1:49:52.500 --> 1:49:55.500]  do you support the peaceful transfer of power
[1:49:55.500 --> 1:49:56.500]  after an election?
[1:49:56.500 --> 1:49:58.500]  And of course, he had to plead the Fifth
[1:49:58.500 --> 1:50:01.500]  because it was required if he was going to assert
[1:50:01.500 --> 1:50:03.500]  his right for every question.
[1:50:03.500 --> 1:50:05.500]  That's the kind of cheap shot.
[1:50:05.500 --> 1:50:09.500]  And the Supreme Court has ruled that the Fifth is not
[1:50:09.500 --> 1:50:12.500]  just for the guilty, it is to protect from a criminal
[1:50:12.500 --> 1:50:13.500]  prosecution.
[1:50:13.500 --> 1:50:14.500]  Sorry, go ahead.
[1:50:14.500 --> 1:50:17.500]  It's not an admission of guilt.
[1:50:17.500 --> 1:50:21.500]  And I know for a fact that, because General Flynn told me this,
[1:50:21.500 --> 1:50:24.500]  he was not in any war room at the Willard,
[1:50:24.500 --> 1:50:26.500]  if even such a war room existed.
[1:50:26.500 --> 1:50:30.500]  So they're stuck with this elaborately produced
[1:50:30.500 --> 1:50:34.500]  television show, which is a giant floparoo from everything.
[1:50:34.500 --> 1:50:35.500]  I agree.
[1:50:35.500 --> 1:50:38.500]  I want to go back to Santilli, but I don't want to open
[1:50:38.500 --> 1:50:41.500]  your beef up with Bannon because I get he did something
[1:50:41.500 --> 1:50:42.500]  wrong to you and I get it all.
[1:50:42.500 --> 1:50:44.500]  But they're in the news.
[1:50:44.500 --> 1:50:45.500]  I'm sure you've seen it.
[1:50:45.500 --> 1:50:48.500]  I've seen it everywhere saying you met with me and Bannon.
[1:50:48.500 --> 1:50:50.500]  You guys hate each other.
[1:50:50.500 --> 1:50:52.500]  I mean, they know that.
[1:50:52.500 --> 1:50:55.500]  So they're lying on purpose claiming you're in bed
[1:50:55.500 --> 1:50:56.500]  with Steve Bannon.
[1:50:56.500 --> 1:50:58.500]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[1:50:58.500 --> 1:51:00.500]  Look, the truth of the matter is, Alex,
[1:51:00.500 --> 1:51:02.500]  I said this about three weeks ago.
[1:51:02.500 --> 1:51:06.500]  The Bible tells us we have to forgive those who have trespassed
[1:51:06.500 --> 1:51:07.500]  against us.
[1:51:07.500 --> 1:51:09.500]  Yes, I think Steve Bannon did me wrong.
[1:51:09.500 --> 1:51:12.500]  I think he perjured himself at my trial.
[1:51:12.500 --> 1:51:13.500]  You know what?
[1:51:13.500 --> 1:51:15.500]  I've forgiven him.
[1:51:15.500 --> 1:51:17.500]  This was nothing but eating me.
[1:51:17.500 --> 1:51:21.500]  So I followed what the Bible suggests and I've forgiven those
[1:51:21.500 --> 1:51:23.500]  who trespassed against me.
[1:51:23.500 --> 1:51:26.500]  In this case, Steve Bannon, I'm praying for him and I only wish
[1:51:26.500 --> 1:51:29.500]  him well because I do think we're on the same side.
[1:51:29.500 --> 1:51:30.500]  No, but I agree.
[1:51:30.500 --> 1:51:32.500]  But the idea that you were scheming with him is ridiculous.
[1:51:32.500 --> 1:51:35.500]  It's like Batman and the Joker hanging out.
[1:51:35.500 --> 1:51:38.500]  I haven't talked to him in at least five years or communicated
[1:51:38.500 --> 1:51:40.500]  with him in any way.
[1:51:40.500 --> 1:51:43.500]  As I said earlier, I've never communicated with White House
[1:51:43.500 --> 1:51:45.500]  Chief Staff Mark Meadows.
[1:51:45.500 --> 1:51:48.500]  I've never met this fellow, John Eastman.
[1:51:48.500 --> 1:51:50.500]  I didn't speak to Mayor Giuliani.
[1:51:50.500 --> 1:51:52.500]  But they say in these meetings, it's a fact that it happens.
[1:51:52.500 --> 1:51:56.500]  So Pete Santilli, where do you predict this fiasco goes?
[1:51:56.500 --> 1:51:58.500]  I know exactly where it's going to go.
[1:51:58.500 --> 1:52:02.500]  And I want if you'll allow me to just send a message to my good
[1:52:02.500 --> 1:52:06.500]  friend, Attorney General Merrick Garland, that it was seated
[1:52:06.500 --> 1:52:10.500]  through a fraudulent election on November 3rd.
[1:52:10.500 --> 1:52:14.500]  Let me tell you where I come from.
[1:52:14.500 --> 1:52:17.500]  I've already been involved in exposing you in two federal
[1:52:17.500 --> 1:52:20.500]  trials, Nevada and Oregon.
[1:52:20.500 --> 1:52:23.500]  Same exact tactics and this is what you have to look forward to
[1:52:23.500 --> 1:52:25.500]  with this January 6th trial.
[1:52:25.500 --> 1:52:29.500]  Your operative that you had that was under a plea agreement,
[1:52:29.500 --> 1:52:32.500]  they forgot to mention in the show trial that that man is
[1:52:32.500 --> 1:52:36.500]  partly responsible for the death of another January 6th
[1:52:36.500 --> 1:52:38.500]  defendant, Matthew Perna.
[1:52:38.500 --> 1:52:39.500]  Don't forget about that.
[1:52:39.500 --> 1:52:41.500]  That was his co-defendant.
[1:52:41.500 --> 1:52:45.500]  They were also charged with interfering with and witness
[1:52:45.500 --> 1:52:47.500]  tampering or informant tampering.
[1:52:47.500 --> 1:52:50.500]  We have all of the evidence and let me break this down in and
[1:52:50.500 --> 1:52:52.500]  let Mr. Garland know.
[1:52:52.500 --> 1:52:55.500]  We also know about your Joint Terrorism Task Force member
[1:52:55.500 --> 1:52:57.500]  named Daniel P Love.
[1:52:57.500 --> 1:53:01.500]  Daniel P Love, I've already submitted to the FBI.
[1:53:01.500 --> 1:53:03.500]  Daniel P Love, identifying him.
[1:53:03.500 --> 1:53:04.500]  I know who he is.
[1:53:04.500 --> 1:53:07.500]  He was involved with the Department of Interior and
[1:53:07.500 --> 1:53:08.500]  entrapping people.
[1:53:08.500 --> 1:53:14.500]  He was on the grounds on January 6th that Jason Van
[1:53:14.500 --> 1:53:17.500]  Tatenhove right now, they're trying to put pressure on
[1:53:17.500 --> 1:53:20.500]  Stuart Rhodes to bear false witness because of Jason's
[1:53:20.500 --> 1:53:21.500]  testimony.
[1:53:21.500 --> 1:53:23.500]  And of course, he's been working with the FBI.
[1:53:23.500 --> 1:53:25.500]  I have documented proof of that.
[1:53:25.500 --> 1:53:27.500]  Let's pull that down for new viewers.
[1:53:27.500 --> 1:53:31.500]  There was 1,000 FBI federal documents admit armed HRT
[1:53:31.500 --> 1:53:32.500]  there.
[1:53:32.500 --> 1:53:34.500]  When we were trying to stop people breaking in, they
[1:53:34.500 --> 1:53:36.500]  stood down and now you've caught the video and
[1:53:36.500 --> 1:53:38.500]  identified them there.
[1:53:38.500 --> 1:53:43.500]  Alex, I also published my reporting discovering their
[1:53:43.500 --> 1:53:45.500]  JTTF member, Daniel P Love.
[1:53:45.500 --> 1:53:47.500]  I reported it to the FBI.
[1:53:47.500 --> 1:53:49.500]  I also pass it on to the attorneys.
[1:53:49.500 --> 1:53:51.500]  Here's the longer story.
[1:53:51.500 --> 1:53:52.500]  It'll play out.
[1:53:52.500 --> 1:53:54.500]  Listen, we're going to have this in a court of law.
[1:53:54.500 --> 1:53:57.500]  They want, we're a people of due process.
[1:53:57.500 --> 1:53:59.500]  In a court of law, we have President Trump's attorney
[1:53:59.500 --> 1:54:01.500]  today who I spoke with.
[1:54:01.500 --> 1:54:02.500]  One of several.
[1:54:02.500 --> 1:54:04.500]  We won't mention any names right now.
[1:54:04.500 --> 1:54:06.500]  But all assets are going to be deployed.
[1:54:06.500 --> 1:54:10.500]  What they did yesterday will seal their fate.
[1:54:10.500 --> 1:54:11.500]  I agree.
[1:54:11.500 --> 1:54:13.500]  In Roger, let me bring this up and then we'll let you go
[1:54:13.500 --> 1:54:15.500]  and have Pete a little bit more in the next hour and
[1:54:15.500 --> 1:54:18.500]  then Royce White to be in the studio.
[1:54:18.500 --> 1:54:22.500]  Obviously, the hack of Biden's phone, Hunter, is that
[1:54:22.500 --> 1:54:26.500]  there's a lot of assets and American patriots about to
[1:54:26.500 --> 1:54:28.500]  come on the field here.
[1:54:28.500 --> 1:54:31.500]  This is not the first trick we've got up our sleeve.
[1:54:31.500 --> 1:54:33.500]  The deep state better get ready because a lot more is
[1:54:33.500 --> 1:54:34.500]  about to come out.
[1:54:34.500 --> 1:54:36.500]  Oh, they better get ready.
[1:54:36.500 --> 1:54:38.500]  And I didn't mean to step on Roger's phone, but let me
[1:54:38.500 --> 1:54:40.500]  say this very clearly.
[1:54:40.500 --> 1:54:42.500]  They have made a fatal error.
[1:54:42.500 --> 1:54:43.500]  They're getting exposed.
[1:54:43.500 --> 1:54:46.500]  We have documentation of what they've done.
[1:54:46.500 --> 1:54:48.500]  And let me tell you what President Trump's attorney,
[1:54:48.500 --> 1:54:50.500]  he's going to come on my show to say this as well,
[1:54:50.500 --> 1:54:53.500]  that this isn't just a pursuit of President Trump.
[1:54:53.500 --> 1:54:56.500]  This isn't a pursuit of Alex Jones.
[1:54:56.500 --> 1:54:59.500]  This isn't a pursuit of Roger Stone and all others that
[1:54:59.500 --> 1:55:00.500]  haven't been named.
[1:55:00.500 --> 1:55:02.500]  It's an attack on America.
[1:55:02.500 --> 1:55:05.500]  This is an operation that is continuing, that these
[1:55:05.500 --> 1:55:08.500]  operatives that were on display was to help advance
[1:55:08.500 --> 1:55:09.500]  their agenda.
[1:55:09.500 --> 1:55:12.500]  These people stole an election November 3rd and their
[1:55:12.500 --> 1:55:13.500]  operation continues.
[1:55:13.500 --> 1:55:14.500]  No, no, I totally agree.
[1:55:14.500 --> 1:55:15.500]  It certainly will come back to you.
[1:55:15.500 --> 1:55:19.500]  But Roger, just in closing, they've screwed themselves.
[1:55:19.500 --> 1:55:21.500]  I mean, this is insane.
[1:55:21.500 --> 1:55:24.500]  Alex, I'm going to finish here with a biblical reference
[1:55:24.500 --> 1:55:27.500]  because Robin Bullock passed this on to me and I say it
[1:55:27.500 --> 1:55:29.500]  every morning and every night.
[1:55:29.500 --> 1:55:34.500]  Simply, Deuteronomy 3.31.6, be strong and courageous.
[1:55:34.500 --> 1:55:37.500]  Do not be afraid or terrified because of them.
[1:55:37.500 --> 1:55:40.500]  For the Lord your God goes with you and he will never
[1:55:40.500 --> 1:55:42.500]  leave you or forsake you.
[1:55:42.500 --> 1:55:46.500]  That is my advice to every patriotic American who loves
[1:55:46.500 --> 1:55:49.500]  this country and will see this through.
[1:55:49.500 --> 1:55:50.500]  By the way, that's not hype.
[1:55:50.500 --> 1:55:53.500]  When you've been in the lion's den, the fiery furnace, every
[1:55:53.500 --> 1:55:55.500]  time we're about to be destroyed, God just comes through
[1:55:55.500 --> 1:55:59.500]  right at the last minute to show you God's in charge.
[1:55:59.500 --> 1:56:00.500]  That's exactly right.
[1:56:00.500 --> 1:56:03.500]  And my faith is in the Lord.
[1:56:03.500 --> 1:56:08.500]  And this idea that we put country ahead of Christ, country
[1:56:08.500 --> 1:56:10.500]  ahead of our Lord, that's not true.
[1:56:10.500 --> 1:56:13.500]  We put our God first.
[1:56:13.500 --> 1:56:17.500]  But this is a Christian based nation and we intend to
[1:56:17.500 --> 1:56:19.500]  preserve our republic.
[1:56:19.500 --> 1:56:23.500]  Roger Stone, give us the websites, give us the T-shirts
[1:56:23.500 --> 1:56:26.500]  or the legal defense because we know you're under attack.
[1:56:26.500 --> 1:56:30.500]  Go to rogerstonestore.com to pick up some of our great
[1:56:30.500 --> 1:56:35.500]  new T-shirts rogerstone.com, pardon me rogerstonestore.com
[1:56:35.500 --> 1:56:38.500]  or if you want to help my wife and I in our epic legal
[1:56:38.500 --> 1:56:42.500]  struggles with the deep state, go to stonedefensefund.com.
[1:56:42.500 --> 1:56:44.500]  All right, Roger.
[1:56:44.500 --> 1:56:45.500]  Thank you so much.
[1:56:45.500 --> 1:56:46.500]  We'll talk to you soon.
[1:56:46.500 --> 1:56:47.500]  We love you.
[1:56:47.500 --> 1:56:49.500]  All right, Pete Santilli, because I'll be sitting around here.
[1:56:49.500 --> 1:56:50.500]  He will host the next five minutes.
[1:56:50.500 --> 1:56:51.500]  I'm uninterrupting.
[1:56:51.500 --> 1:56:54.500]  I have Royce White coming in here running for Congress.
[1:56:54.500 --> 1:56:55.500]  You can see Ilan Omar.
[1:56:55.500 --> 1:56:56.500]  He is on fire.
[1:56:56.500 --> 1:56:59.500]  Former NBA star, MMA fighter, everything else.
[1:56:59.500 --> 1:57:01.500]  He's coming in here, knocking out of the park.
[1:57:01.500 --> 1:57:03.500]  That is coming up.
[1:57:03.500 --> 1:57:05.500]  But such an epic moment.
[1:57:05.500 --> 1:57:07.500]  Separately, we need your funding.
[1:57:07.500 --> 1:57:09.500]  Get an Alan Jones's right T-shirt.
[1:57:09.500 --> 1:57:10.500]  It's amazing.
[1:57:10.500 --> 1:57:12.500]  You'll meet what will happen when you wear it.
[1:57:12.500 --> 1:57:13.500]  Infoworkstore.com.
[1:57:13.500 --> 1:57:17.500]  We have Ultimate Turmeric Formula back in stock, 25% off.
[1:57:17.500 --> 1:57:19.500]  Highest quality of humanoid, 95%.
[1:57:19.500 --> 1:57:21.500]  Nobody's got anything close to that.
[1:57:21.500 --> 1:57:24.500]  It is so good for your libido, your energy, your body,
[1:57:24.500 --> 1:57:27.500]  your joints, your immune system.
[1:57:27.500 --> 1:57:31.500]  Bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula back in stock, 25% off.
[1:57:31.500 --> 1:57:32.500]  Infoworkstore.com.
[1:57:32.500 --> 1:57:34.500]  I want to thank all the listeners for the support.
[1:57:34.500 --> 1:57:35.500]  You know who you are.
[1:57:35.500 --> 1:57:39.500]  All right, the next five minutes segment.
[1:57:39.500 --> 1:57:42.500]  And he's going to host with all the other info he's got.
[1:57:42.500 --> 1:57:44.500]  And then Royce White in studio.
[1:57:44.500 --> 1:57:48.500]  Stay with us.
[1:57:48.500 --> 1:57:52.500]  Seven months ago, in December of 2021, we launched the first
[1:57:52.500 --> 1:57:55.500]  in the three-coin founding member series, George Washington,
[1:57:55.500 --> 1:57:57.500]  Slaying the Dragon.
[1:57:57.500 --> 1:57:59.500]  Then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin.
[1:57:59.500 --> 1:58:03.500]  And finally, the Second Amendment comment-ticket Molan Lobby coin.
[1:58:03.500 --> 1:58:08.500]  There are only 75 coins left in the three-coin series,
[1:58:08.500 --> 1:58:13.500]  exclusively, right now, at 1776coin.com.
[1:58:13.500 --> 1:58:16.500]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members
[1:58:16.500 --> 1:58:19.500]  for this big project we're launching in the near future,
[1:58:19.500 --> 1:58:22.500]  you'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made
[1:58:22.500 --> 1:58:26.500]  of the sheepdog chasing the wolf in a personal message.
[1:58:26.500 --> 1:58:32.500]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776coin.com.
[1:58:32.500 --> 1:58:34.500]  This is history happening now.
[1:58:34.500 --> 1:58:37.500]  Infoworkstore support is changing the world.
[1:58:37.500 --> 1:58:42.500]  And this is the final 75 three-coin set exclusively available
[1:58:42.500 --> 1:58:47.500]  at 1776coin.com.
[1:58:47.500 --> 1:58:52.500]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S.
[1:58:52.500 --> 1:58:56.500]  that supplies the highest quality signature-reducing Faraday
[1:58:56.500 --> 1:58:59.500]  cages, the Pentagon, and other U.S. government agencies.
[1:58:59.500 --> 1:59:02.500]  And now they have produced specifically for us this made
[1:59:02.500 --> 1:59:07.500]  America high-end line at a very affordable price,
[1:59:07.500 --> 1:59:09.500]  whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone
[1:59:09.500 --> 1:59:14.500]  or big pouches that protect laptops and iPads or big bags
[1:59:14.500 --> 1:59:16.500]  that promote whatever electronics you want to put in it
[1:59:16.500 --> 1:59:18.500]  like desktop computers.
[1:59:18.500 --> 1:59:22.500]  It is all exclusively available at infoworkstore.com
[1:59:22.500 --> 1:59:24.500]  under the Redux name.
[1:59:24.500 --> 1:59:28.500]  Redux is Infoworks, taking the highest quality products

[1:59:31.500 --> 1:59:35.500]  In this insane world, you are crazy if you don't protect
[1:59:35.500 --> 1:59:38.500]  your signature, your identity from identity theft,
[1:59:38.500 --> 1:59:41.500]  hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.
[1:59:41.500 --> 1:59:44.500]  This is one of the hottest items out there today
[1:59:44.500 --> 1:59:47.500]  that's exclusively available at infoworkstore.com.
[1:59:47.500 --> 1:59:53.500]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:59:53.500 --> 1:59:55.500]  you are the Resistance.
[2:00:00.500 --> 2:00:03.500]  All right, Roy Swine in studio coming up.
[2:00:03.500 --> 2:00:05.500]  Pete Santilli, investigative journalist,
[2:00:05.500 --> 2:00:06.500]  January 6th expert.
[2:00:06.500 --> 2:00:08.500]  You're like, I don't care about January 6th.
[2:00:08.500 --> 2:00:09.500]  You know it's fraud.
[2:00:09.500 --> 2:00:10.500]  It doesn't matter.
[2:00:10.500 --> 2:00:11.500]  That's their takeover plan.
[2:00:11.500 --> 2:00:13.500]  Lay out your big bombshell information.
[2:00:13.500 --> 2:00:14.500]  Pete Santilli.
[2:00:14.500 --> 2:00:16.500]  Okay, two operatives yesterday.
[2:00:16.500 --> 2:00:20.500]  Basically, we have the, I call them the chimpanzees.
[2:00:20.500 --> 2:00:23.500]  They have hundreds and thousands of them that produce paper.
[2:00:23.500 --> 2:00:27.500]  They did the same thing back in 2014, 2016.
[2:00:27.500 --> 2:00:28.500]  Same methodology.
[2:00:28.500 --> 2:00:29.500]  It's an operation.
[2:00:29.500 --> 2:00:30.500]  They run it well in advance.
[2:00:30.500 --> 2:00:31.500]  They use social media.
[2:00:31.500 --> 2:00:33.500]  They lure in all the patriots.
[2:00:33.500 --> 2:00:34.500]  They have provocateurs.
[2:00:34.500 --> 2:00:36.500]  They've got their FBI informants.
[2:00:36.500 --> 2:00:38.500]  They've got their CIA, I think,
[2:00:38.500 --> 2:00:40.500]  although obviously at this level,
[2:00:40.500 --> 2:00:43.500]  we had Ukrainians on the ground we never heard about.
[2:00:43.500 --> 2:00:47.500]  But lay almond, here is what you should feel a sense of hope.
[2:00:47.500 --> 2:00:50.500]  Is that the difference between what I went through
[2:00:50.500 --> 2:00:55.500]  and what all of these indicted and unindicted co-conspirators,
[2:00:55.500 --> 2:00:57.500]  including President Trump, have on their side.
[2:00:57.500 --> 2:01:00.500]  Is through all that experience, we know their methodology.
[2:01:00.500 --> 2:01:02.500]  They're getting caught in the act.
[2:01:02.500 --> 2:01:05.500]  What you're seeing with the January 6th show trials
[2:01:05.500 --> 2:01:08.500]  is nothing more than a continuation of the operation.
[2:01:08.500 --> 2:01:12.500]  The operation is to overthrow the United States of America.
[2:01:12.500 --> 2:01:16.500]  That these two operators yesterday, one of whom,
[2:01:16.500 --> 2:01:19.500]  I have his work product.
[2:01:19.500 --> 2:01:22.500]  He provided it to the FBI as a cooperate.
[2:01:22.500 --> 2:01:24.500]  I don't know if he was on the payroll.
[2:01:24.500 --> 2:01:26.500]  Well, that's yet to be determined in a court of law
[2:01:26.500 --> 2:01:28.500]  or through legal proceedings.
[2:01:28.500 --> 2:01:31.500]  We will certainly let all of the attorneys know,
[2:01:31.500 --> 2:01:34.500]  and they all know, all the criminal attorneys.
[2:01:34.500 --> 2:01:37.500]  And if you haven't been reached as of this morning,
[2:01:37.500 --> 2:01:42.500]  the word is out that the Jason V,
[2:01:42.500 --> 2:01:44.500]  as well as this other guy Ayers,
[2:01:44.500 --> 2:01:48.500]  will be called in for depositions and testimony.
[2:01:48.500 --> 2:01:52.500]  And we're going to find out what their involvement was
[2:01:52.500 --> 2:01:54.500]  incorporating with the US government
[2:01:54.500 --> 2:01:57.500]  to bear false witness, to give testimony
[2:01:57.500 --> 2:01:59.500]  as part of this operation to overthrow
[2:01:59.500 --> 2:02:01.500]  the United States of America.
[2:02:01.500 --> 2:02:04.500]  That we have known whistleblowers right now
[2:02:04.500 --> 2:02:09.500]  that have facial recognition of the frontline breach
[2:02:09.500 --> 2:02:12.500]  at the Capitol that day.
[2:02:12.500 --> 2:02:14.500]  The good guys, the white hats,
[2:02:14.500 --> 2:02:18.500]  that have seen those facial recognition IDs
[2:02:18.500 --> 2:02:20.500]  have essentially said that the majority of the people
[2:02:20.500 --> 2:02:23.500]  at that breach were on the payroll.
[2:02:23.500 --> 2:02:24.500]  They were friendlies.
[2:02:24.500 --> 2:02:25.500]  They were feds.
[2:02:25.500 --> 2:02:27.500]  Those whistleblowers are going to come forward.
[2:02:27.500 --> 2:02:30.500]  That once these trials start beginning,
[2:02:30.500 --> 2:02:32.500]  that we're going to expose the truth.
[2:02:32.500 --> 2:02:34.500]  We're going to bring these.
[2:02:34.500 --> 2:02:37.500]  Actually, let's say this to Mr. Merrick Garland.
[2:02:37.500 --> 2:02:38.500]  Very loud and clear.
[2:02:38.500 --> 2:02:42.500]  We stand on the truth and righteousness.
[2:02:42.500 --> 2:02:44.500]  And you say that you're watching these proceedings.
[2:02:44.500 --> 2:02:47.500]  Well, Merrick Garland, we're also watching
[2:02:47.500 --> 2:02:50.500]  your overthrow of the United States of America as well.
[2:02:50.500 --> 2:02:51.500]  The truth will set us free.
[2:02:51.500 --> 2:02:54.500]  Of course, this is an info truth bomb
[2:02:54.500 --> 2:02:56.500]  across the bow of the DOJ.
[2:02:56.500 --> 2:02:58.500]  And it's not my first rodeo.
[2:02:58.500 --> 2:03:00.500]  This is going to be yet another example
[2:03:00.500 --> 2:03:03.500]  of you guys attempting to bring harm
[2:03:03.500 --> 2:03:05.500]  to the American people in our country.
[2:03:05.500 --> 2:03:08.500]  You need to hold power.
[2:03:08.500 --> 2:03:10.500]  You're so thirsty for power to run.
[2:03:10.500 --> 2:03:13.500]  Of course, you're drug trafficking, human trafficking,
[2:03:13.500 --> 2:03:17.500]  the ballot scams, your election fraud scams.
[2:03:17.500 --> 2:03:18.500]  The truth will set us free.
[2:03:18.500 --> 2:03:20.500]  And it's going to happen in a court of law.
[2:03:20.500 --> 2:03:23.500]  And I believe that I'm standing here as a result
[2:03:23.500 --> 2:03:25.500]  of the Lord's miracles.
[2:03:25.500 --> 2:03:26.500]  I wouldn't be here.
[2:03:26.500 --> 2:03:27.500]  I face four life sentences.
[2:03:27.500 --> 2:03:28.500]  That didn't scare me.
[2:03:28.500 --> 2:03:31.500]  I will walk through the valley of the shadow of death
[2:03:31.500 --> 2:03:33.500]  with each and every one of these defendants
[2:03:33.500 --> 2:03:36.500]  because what they do not have, what they did not have,
[2:03:36.500 --> 2:03:39.500]  or what I didn't have compared to what they have now,
[2:03:39.500 --> 2:03:41.500]  is that I've got a whole heck of a lot of experience
[2:03:41.500 --> 2:03:43.500]  and it's getting to all these attorneys.
[2:03:43.500 --> 2:03:45.500]  You will all be held accountable
[2:03:45.500 --> 2:03:48.500]  each and every one of you, each and every one of you.
[2:03:48.500 --> 2:03:50.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to remember this name.
[2:03:50.500 --> 2:03:53.500]  Matthew Perna, the federal government brought
[2:03:53.500 --> 2:03:56.500]  its full force upon this man, a good man.
[2:03:56.500 --> 2:03:57.500]  Go look him up.
[2:03:57.500 --> 2:03:59.500]  He committed suicide.
[2:03:59.500 --> 2:04:01.500]  He couldn't withstand trial.
[2:04:01.500 --> 2:04:03.500]  His attorney struck a plea agreement.
[2:04:03.500 --> 2:04:06.500]  His co-defendant, Mr. Ayers yesterday,
[2:04:06.500 --> 2:04:12.500]  I believe, is partly responsible for Matthew Perna's death.
[2:04:12.500 --> 2:04:13.500]  And that's a question mark.
[2:04:13.500 --> 2:04:14.500]  You have to be determined.
[2:04:14.500 --> 2:04:15.500]  We will look into that.
[2:04:15.500 --> 2:04:20.500]  The Jason Van Tattendenhove and all of these FBI cooperators
[2:04:20.500 --> 2:04:24.500]  from Bundy Ranch and Malier, you're still operating.
[2:04:24.500 --> 2:04:27.500]  We're going to expose you, Daniel P. Love.
[2:04:27.500 --> 2:04:28.500]  Everything will come out in the open.
[2:04:28.500 --> 2:04:30.500]  All assets are deployed.
[2:04:30.500 --> 2:04:32.500]  All of President Trump's attorneys
[2:04:32.500 --> 2:04:35.500]  and a huge team of people to bring the truth forward.
[2:04:35.500 --> 2:04:37.500]  All right, Pete Santelli, you are on fire.
[2:04:37.500 --> 2:04:38.500]  We love you.
[2:04:38.500 --> 2:04:40.500]  We'll talk to you very, very soon, my brother.
[2:04:40.500 --> 2:04:41.500]  Thank you, sir.
[2:04:41.500 --> 2:04:45.500]  All right, Royce White running for Congress against the evil.
[2:04:45.500 --> 2:04:48.500]  Ilhan Omar just got booed by her own Somali constituent
[2:04:48.500 --> 2:04:49.500]  straight ahead.
[2:04:49.500 --> 2:04:51.500]  We're going to talk about going on the offense.
[2:04:51.500 --> 2:04:57.500]  Stay with us and everybody tune in now.
[2:04:57.500 --> 2:05:00.500]  Seven months ago in December of 2021,
[2:05:00.500 --> 2:05:04.500]  we launched the first in the three-coin founding member series,
[2:05:04.500 --> 2:05:06.500]  George Washington slaying the dragon.
[2:05:06.500 --> 2:05:08.500]  Then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin.
[2:05:08.500 --> 2:05:12.500]  And finally, the Second Amendment comment-ticket Molan Labe coin.
[2:05:12.500 --> 2:05:18.500]  There are only 75 coins left in the three-coin series.
[2:05:18.500 --> 2:05:23.500]  Exclusively right now at 1776.com.
[2:05:23.500 --> 2:05:27.500]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members
[2:05:27.500 --> 2:05:29.500]  for this big project we're launching in the near future,
[2:05:29.500 --> 2:05:32.500]  you'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made
[2:05:32.500 --> 2:05:36.500]  of the sheepdog chasing the wolf in a personal message.
[2:05:36.500 --> 2:05:42.500]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776.com.
[2:05:42.500 --> 2:05:44.500]  This is history happening now.
[2:05:44.500 --> 2:05:47.500]  Info War States, your support is changing the world.
[2:05:47.500 --> 2:05:52.500]  And this is the final 75 three-coin set exclusively available
[2:05:52.500 --> 2:05:58.500]  at 1776.com.
[2:05:58.500 --> 2:06:16.500]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:16.500 --> 2:06:20.500]  There are so many amazing congressional candidates out there.
[2:06:20.500 --> 2:06:23.500]  And we are so blessed to be able to talk to them.
[2:06:23.500 --> 2:06:27.500]  But amongst all those folks, Royce White's got victory written all over him
[2:06:27.500 --> 2:06:32.500]  with the NBA and MMA and so much more Royce White.us
[2:06:32.500 --> 2:06:36.500]  running for Congress against the evil Ilhan Omar.
[2:06:36.500 --> 2:06:39.500]  And he is in studio with us for the next 55 minutes
[2:06:39.500 --> 2:06:41.500]  and he's hosting the fourth hour today,
[2:06:41.500 --> 2:06:44.500]  head of the War Room with Owen Shroyer, 3 p.m. Central.
[2:06:44.500 --> 2:06:46.500]  And Royce, it's great to have you here with us.
[2:06:46.500 --> 2:06:48.500]  Everybody's sick of January 6th.
[2:06:48.500 --> 2:06:49.500]  It has no viewers.
[2:06:49.500 --> 2:06:51.500]  Our listeners know we didn't do it on purpose.
[2:06:51.500 --> 2:06:52.500]  They know it was a setup.
[2:06:52.500 --> 2:06:53.500]  They don't want to hear about it,
[2:06:53.500 --> 2:06:56.500]  but they're trying to brand all oppositions as terrorists.
[2:06:56.500 --> 2:06:58.500]  And it's a fiasco.
[2:06:58.500 --> 2:06:59.500]  So we've been covering it.
[2:06:59.500 --> 2:07:00.500]  I said, what do you want to hit first?
[2:07:00.500 --> 2:07:04.500]  Ukraine, the economy, the open borders, the gun grabs,
[2:07:04.500 --> 2:07:05.500]  the pedophile rings.
[2:07:05.500 --> 2:07:07.500]  You said, I want to hit January 6th first.
[2:07:07.500 --> 2:07:10.500]  We'll finish up with that and then move on to all the other big topics.
[2:07:10.500 --> 2:07:11.500]  Yeah.
[2:07:11.500 --> 2:07:12.500]  Well, thanks for having me.
[2:07:12.500 --> 2:07:14.500]  It's an honor to be here first and foremost.
[2:07:14.500 --> 2:07:19.500]  And for me, I've been watching the January 6th thing
[2:07:19.500 --> 2:07:21.500]  since it first broke out.
[2:07:21.500 --> 2:07:26.500]  And what stands out the most to me is the audacity
[2:07:26.500 --> 2:07:30.500]  of the federal government, this particular federal government,
[2:07:30.500 --> 2:07:32.500]  or the audacity of...
[2:07:32.500 --> 2:07:33.500]  This regime.
[2:07:33.500 --> 2:07:36.500]  This regime, this media, this establishment.
[2:07:36.500 --> 2:07:41.500]  The audacity of it is, in short, what they are saying,
[2:07:41.500 --> 2:07:43.500]  and what many even on the right in the Republican Party
[2:07:43.500 --> 2:07:46.500]  of the American First Movement have capitulated to is,
[2:07:46.500 --> 2:07:48.500]  under no circumstances should the federal government
[2:07:48.500 --> 2:07:50.500]  have to fear the people.
[2:07:50.500 --> 2:07:54.500]  And that's an audacious position for elected officials to be in.
[2:07:54.500 --> 2:07:56.500]  And I've been waiting for somebody to...
[2:07:56.500 --> 2:07:57.500]  You're quoting Thomas Jefferson.
[2:07:57.500 --> 2:07:58.500]  Yeah.
[2:07:58.500 --> 2:08:00.500]  Where there is liberty, the government fears the people.
[2:08:00.500 --> 2:08:03.500]  Where there is tyranny, the people for the government.
[2:08:03.500 --> 2:08:05.500]  It should be, in my opinion.
[2:08:05.500 --> 2:08:08.500]  And I've been waiting, as I've been watching the proceedings,
[2:08:08.500 --> 2:08:10.500]  I've been waiting for somebody to stand up
[2:08:10.500 --> 2:08:12.500]  or ask any of these people on the committee
[2:08:12.500 --> 2:08:14.500]  or any of these politicians that are in office right now
[2:08:14.500 --> 2:08:17.500]  who have commented on January 6th.
[2:08:17.500 --> 2:08:21.500]  Under what set of circumstances would they see
[2:08:21.500 --> 2:08:24.500]  a hostile or violent revolt warranted
[2:08:24.500 --> 2:08:26.500]  as a litmus test?
[2:08:26.500 --> 2:08:29.500]  And I imagine that there would be no set of circumstances
[2:08:29.500 --> 2:08:31.500]  that they would believe...
[2:08:31.500 --> 2:08:32.500]  Exactly.
[2:08:32.500 --> 2:08:34.500]  They're rejecting July 4th declaration of the penance.
[2:08:34.500 --> 2:08:35.500]  Outright.
[2:08:35.500 --> 2:08:36.500]  If we had Hitler as president...
[2:08:36.500 --> 2:08:37.500]  Outright.
[2:08:37.500 --> 2:08:39.500]  They're saying outright there's no set of circumstances
[2:08:39.500 --> 2:08:41.500]  where a violent revolt against the federal government
[2:08:41.500 --> 2:08:44.500]  is warranted, and that is the telltale sign of tyranny
[2:08:44.500 --> 2:08:46.500]  and authoritarianism.
[2:08:46.500 --> 2:08:48.500]  Perfectly said.
[2:08:48.500 --> 2:08:51.500]  They're super weak, but that's what scares me.
[2:08:51.500 --> 2:08:53.500]  They're willing to do anything.
[2:08:53.500 --> 2:08:54.500]  Absolutely.
[2:08:54.500 --> 2:08:56.500]  The ends justifies the means,
[2:08:56.500 --> 2:08:58.500]  and there's nothing more dangerous than that.
[2:09:00.500 --> 2:09:03.500]  We can cover the waterfront here, Royce White.
[2:09:03.500 --> 2:09:05.500]  What do you want to get into now?
[2:09:05.500 --> 2:09:09.500]  Well, you know, this is my first rodeo in politics.
[2:09:09.500 --> 2:09:11.500]  I came from the void.
[2:09:11.500 --> 2:09:12.500]  I was an athlete.
[2:09:12.500 --> 2:09:14.500]  I was a truther, you know,
[2:09:14.500 --> 2:09:16.500]  speaking about mental health and all of these sort of things,
[2:09:16.500 --> 2:09:19.500]  speaking out against the NBA and the corporatocracy,
[2:09:19.500 --> 2:09:22.500]  so I haven't been very political during...
[2:09:22.500 --> 2:09:23.500]  And you are ahead of your time,
[2:09:23.500 --> 2:09:26.500]  because now the NBA has endorsed Chinese slavery,
[2:09:26.500 --> 2:09:27.500]  the murder of Uyghurs.
[2:09:27.500 --> 2:09:28.500]  I mean, it's crazy.
[2:09:28.500 --> 2:09:29.500]  And not only that.
[2:09:29.500 --> 2:09:33.500]  I mean, mental health has become the other cultural coup
[2:09:33.500 --> 2:09:35.500]  that's taken place, you know,
[2:09:35.500 --> 2:09:38.500]  in the common and public square.
[2:09:38.500 --> 2:09:40.500]  But I haven't been very political,
[2:09:40.500 --> 2:09:42.500]  and I guess the most alarming thing for me
[2:09:42.500 --> 2:09:46.500]  stepping into politics for this election cycle
[2:09:46.500 --> 2:09:48.500]  is the Republican Party.
[2:09:48.500 --> 2:09:49.500]  Right?
[2:09:49.500 --> 2:09:52.500]  The Republican Party is completely controlled opposition.
[2:09:52.500 --> 2:09:53.500]  Oh, it is.
[2:09:53.500 --> 2:09:54.500]  It's absurd.
[2:09:54.500 --> 2:09:55.500]  It's the big problem.
[2:09:55.500 --> 2:09:56.500]  It is.
[2:09:56.500 --> 2:09:59.500]  They are the outer bastion safeguard for the New World Order,
[2:09:59.500 --> 2:10:03.500]  and many of us have a huge problem with the leftists
[2:10:03.500 --> 2:10:05.500]  and the Democrat Party and their platform,
[2:10:05.500 --> 2:10:07.500]  which we are right to have a problem with,
[2:10:07.500 --> 2:10:09.500]  but the outer bastion is really the Republican Party.
[2:10:09.500 --> 2:10:10.500]  I agree.
[2:10:10.500 --> 2:10:12.500]  The Democrats are easy to beat if it wasn't
[2:10:12.500 --> 2:10:14.500]  for the Republican loyal opposition.
[2:10:14.500 --> 2:10:17.500]  State by state, community by community,
[2:10:17.500 --> 2:10:19.500]  the Republicans are the first line of defense
[2:10:19.500 --> 2:10:21.500]  to make sure that true American patriots
[2:10:21.500 --> 2:10:25.500]  do not get into the general elections.
[2:10:25.500 --> 2:10:27.500]  And in my campaign, in my primary,
[2:10:27.500 --> 2:10:29.500]  I'm running against a woman named Cicely Davis,
[2:10:29.500 --> 2:10:31.500]  who stood up before our convention,
[2:10:31.500 --> 2:10:33.500]  our CD5 convention,
[2:10:33.500 --> 2:10:36.500]  and won an endorsement by saying that abortion
[2:10:36.500 --> 2:10:39.500]  was red meat politics for the base.
[2:10:39.500 --> 2:10:43.500]  And then, you know, after this Roe v. Wade decision came down,
[2:10:43.500 --> 2:10:45.500]  she's celebrating the decision online,
[2:10:45.500 --> 2:10:47.500]  just as if the people who vote in my district
[2:10:47.500 --> 2:10:51.500]  or any district around the country are complete idiots.
[2:10:51.500 --> 2:10:53.500]  And we've accepted it, you know,
[2:10:53.500 --> 2:10:55.500]  and I commend you for what you said the other day
[2:10:55.500 --> 2:10:57.500]  when you were talking about the transgender piece,
[2:10:57.500 --> 2:10:59.500]  and I shot you a text and said,
[2:10:59.500 --> 2:11:01.500]  it's one of the best sound bites I've ever heard,
[2:11:01.500 --> 2:11:03.500]  but it resonated and it's so true
[2:11:03.500 --> 2:11:06.500]  because you get the government you deserve.
[2:11:06.500 --> 2:11:08.500]  We spend a lot of time talking about the powers
[2:11:08.500 --> 2:11:10.500]  that be in the moral culpability
[2:11:10.500 --> 2:11:12.500]  and the crisis of leadership, which we have,
[2:11:12.500 --> 2:11:14.500]  but we've allowed it, we've accepted it,
[2:11:14.500 --> 2:11:18.500]  we've gotten too caught up in materialism and security,
[2:11:18.500 --> 2:11:20.500]  and we've traded away our freedom.
[2:11:20.500 --> 2:11:22.500]  I agree, and now the chickens have come home to roost.
[2:11:22.500 --> 2:11:25.500]  I mean, I've got three stacks here of economic news,
[2:11:25.500 --> 2:11:28.500]  and as a man, I mean, I'm ready for this,
[2:11:28.500 --> 2:11:30.500]  but I get scared.
[2:11:30.500 --> 2:11:32.500]  I mean, 650 billion,
[2:11:32.500 --> 2:11:34.500]  vibe's about to send to Ukraine.
[2:11:34.500 --> 2:11:37.500]  Not even hitting the news.
[2:11:37.500 --> 2:11:39.500]  Prices exploding everywhere.
[2:11:39.500 --> 2:11:42.500]  We came around our operation as the prices exploding,
[2:11:42.500 --> 2:11:44.500]  and they're just ignoring it.
[2:11:44.500 --> 2:11:46.500]  They're bringing down society.
[2:11:46.500 --> 2:11:48.500]  What do you think is about to happen?
[2:11:48.500 --> 2:11:50.500]  Well, I think they're trying to crash the economy.
[2:11:50.500 --> 2:11:52.500]  I think the only way you can bring about
[2:11:52.500 --> 2:11:54.500]  New World Order is to have an economic crisis
[2:11:54.500 --> 2:11:56.500]  of biblical proportions
[2:11:56.500 --> 2:12:00.500]  and to once again use chaos,
[2:12:00.500 --> 2:12:02.500]  just as they did post World War II,
[2:12:02.500 --> 2:12:04.500]  to justify global governance.
[2:12:04.500 --> 2:12:06.500]  And this whole thing has been structured
[2:12:06.500 --> 2:12:08.500]  based on World War II,
[2:12:08.500 --> 2:12:10.500]  and many people that I go to my district
[2:12:10.500 --> 2:12:13.500]  don't really understand the scope of time
[2:12:13.500 --> 2:12:15.500]  that this is all predicated on.
[2:12:15.500 --> 2:12:17.500]  They want a worldwide Marshall Plan,
[2:12:17.500 --> 2:12:19.500]  and they're on words where they collapse the world
[2:12:19.500 --> 2:12:21.500]  and they pose as savers.
[2:12:21.500 --> 2:12:23.500]  Absolutely.
[2:12:23.500 --> 2:12:25.500]  I just went back the other day and I posted
[2:12:25.500 --> 2:12:28.500]  Gaddafi's 2009 UN speech,
[2:12:28.500 --> 2:12:31.500]  and no matter what you think about Gaddafi or anybody,
[2:12:31.500 --> 2:12:33.500]  when you hear...
[2:12:33.500 --> 2:12:35.500]  Gaddafi compared to Biden or Obama is a great guy.
[2:12:35.500 --> 2:12:37.500]  When you hear the truth,
[2:12:37.500 --> 2:12:39.500]  you should adhere to the truth.
[2:12:39.500 --> 2:12:41.500]  And the truth is that the UN,
[2:12:41.500 --> 2:12:43.500]  NATO, the Security Council,
[2:12:43.500 --> 2:12:45.500]  now as the party of Davos
[2:12:45.500 --> 2:12:47.500]  and this whole globalist agenda
[2:12:47.500 --> 2:12:49.500]  has masqueraded and spoken about it
[2:12:49.500 --> 2:12:51.500]  as though it's a conspiracy theory.
[2:12:51.500 --> 2:12:53.500]  And what was what Gaddafi said?
[2:12:53.500 --> 2:12:55.500]  Well, basically Gaddafi said
[2:12:55.500 --> 2:12:57.500]  that the inception of the United Nations
[2:12:57.500 --> 2:12:59.500]  may have been genuine in nature
[2:12:59.500 --> 2:13:01.500]  because of what happened with Hitler in Germany,
[2:13:01.500 --> 2:13:03.500]  but that the preamble
[2:13:03.500 --> 2:13:05.500]  of the United Nations does not
[2:13:05.500 --> 2:13:07.500]  line up with the Charter,
[2:13:07.500 --> 2:13:09.500]  that all of the nations in the United Nations
[2:13:09.500 --> 2:13:11.500]  were supposed to be equal, yet the Security Council
[2:13:11.500 --> 2:13:13.500]  granted itself permanent cease and veto power.
[2:13:13.500 --> 2:13:15.500]  A dictatorship.
[2:13:15.500 --> 2:13:17.500]  That's right, and since, and what they claimed
[2:13:17.500 --> 2:13:19.500]  was that this is the only way to keep war
[2:13:19.500 --> 2:13:21.500]  from breaking out as it did in World War II,
[2:13:21.500 --> 2:13:23.500]  but that's not what happened.
[2:13:23.500 --> 2:13:25.500]  Seventy aggressive wars have happened
[2:13:25.500 --> 2:13:27.500]  and the United Nations have...
[2:13:27.500 --> 2:13:29.500]  The UN oversees those predatory wars.
[2:13:29.500 --> 2:13:31.500]  Absolutely, they are the dictators of who
[2:13:31.500 --> 2:13:33.500]  have aggressive wars, and that's
[2:13:33.500 --> 2:13:35.500]  completely illegitimate.
[2:13:35.500 --> 2:13:37.500]  Exactly, it's a way that corporations
[2:13:37.500 --> 2:13:39.500]  wage war without ever being challenged.
[2:13:39.500 --> 2:13:41.500]  Corporatocracy.
[2:13:41.500 --> 2:13:43.500]  And finally, they run up against Russia and China,
[2:13:43.500 --> 2:13:45.500]  and they're not playing.
[2:13:45.500 --> 2:13:47.500]  Well, the Russian people and the Chinese people
[2:13:47.500 --> 2:13:49.500]  have extremely
[2:13:49.500 --> 2:13:51.500]  national, national, ethno-national
[2:13:51.500 --> 2:13:53.500]  cultures in honor,
[2:13:53.500 --> 2:13:55.500]  and Vladimir Putin believes in the Russian people
[2:13:55.500 --> 2:13:57.500]  and President Xi,
[2:13:57.500 --> 2:13:59.500]  the Chinese, they believe the Chinese people
[2:13:59.500 --> 2:14:01.500]  are very proud people.
[2:14:01.500 --> 2:14:03.500]  And we're not endorsing any of that, the point is
[2:14:03.500 --> 2:14:05.500]  the globalists are running up against something they can't be.
[2:14:05.500 --> 2:14:07.500]  Yeah, the point is that, you know,
[2:14:07.500 --> 2:14:09.500]  there's a four player jump ball,
[2:14:09.500 --> 2:14:11.500]  you got the free people of the world,
[2:14:11.500 --> 2:14:13.500]  the small man, the little man
[2:14:13.500 --> 2:14:15.500]  who sits beneath the powers that be,
[2:14:15.500 --> 2:14:17.500]  and then you have the globalists,
[2:14:17.500 --> 2:14:19.500]  and then you have China and Russia,
[2:14:19.500 --> 2:14:21.500]  and China and Russia are national
[2:14:21.500 --> 2:14:23.500]  dictatorships, and the party of Davos
[2:14:23.500 --> 2:14:25.500]  is an international dictatorship, it's just a jump ball.
[2:14:25.500 --> 2:14:27.500]  Got level, how do you see it unfolding?
[2:14:27.500 --> 2:14:29.500]  I would say that
[2:14:29.500 --> 2:14:31.500]  Vladimir Putin's not going to
[2:14:31.500 --> 2:14:33.500]  not going to back off,
[2:14:33.500 --> 2:14:35.500]  and that the war
[2:14:35.500 --> 2:14:37.500]  that will unfold or the conflict that will continue
[2:14:37.500 --> 2:14:39.500]  to brew between Russia and Ukraine
[2:14:39.500 --> 2:14:41.500]  will lead to a globalist
[2:14:41.500 --> 2:14:43.500]  and American justification
[2:14:43.500 --> 2:14:45.500]  to revoke rights and continue to send money
[2:14:45.500 --> 2:14:47.500]  to...
[2:14:47.500 --> 2:14:49.500]  Well, that's what Putin said, he said,
[2:14:49.500 --> 2:14:51.500]  we haven't even started a fight, we're fully committed.
[2:14:51.500 --> 2:14:53.500]  Yeah, they're all in.
[2:14:53.500 --> 2:14:55.500]  650 billion
[2:14:55.500 --> 2:14:57.500]  proposed by the IMF yesterday.
[2:14:59.500 --> 2:15:01.500]  I mean, it's, that's treason
[2:15:01.500 --> 2:15:03.500]  in my opinion.
[2:15:03.500 --> 2:15:05.500]  Royce White's our guest,
[2:15:05.500 --> 2:15:07.500]  we're going to talk about American politics,
[2:15:07.500 --> 2:15:09.500]  we're going to talk about the world,
[2:15:09.500 --> 2:15:11.500]  we're going to talk about political correctness,
[2:15:11.500 --> 2:15:13.500]  transgenderism, we're going to talk about everything
[2:15:13.500 --> 2:15:15.500]  straight ahead, how do people find a congressional site,
[2:15:15.500 --> 2:15:17.500]  how do they get involved, what you're doing?
[2:15:17.500 --> 2:15:19.500]  Roycewhite.us, that's our campaign website,
[2:15:19.500 --> 2:15:21.500]  please stop by if you can
[2:15:21.500 --> 2:15:23.500]  and give a donation if you're so inclined
[2:15:23.500 --> 2:15:25.500]  we are fighting against the establishment
[2:15:25.500 --> 2:15:27.500]  even in the Republican Party.
[2:15:27.500 --> 2:15:29.500]  Wow, what a historic time to be alive.
[2:15:29.500 --> 2:15:31.500]  Royce White is in studio,
[2:15:31.500 --> 2:15:33.500]  he'll be hosting the fourth hour today,
[2:15:33.500 --> 2:15:35.500]  get ready for it and spread the word
[2:15:35.500 --> 2:15:37.500]  because what we're doing here,
[2:15:37.500 --> 2:15:39.500]  they've tried to shut down, what we're doing here
[2:15:39.500 --> 2:15:41.500]  is game changing, the people coming together
[2:15:41.500 --> 2:15:43.500]  for justice and freedom.
[2:15:43.500 --> 2:15:45.500]  We'll be right back, infowars.com
[2:15:45.500 --> 2:15:55.500]  Kamara's News Today.
[2:16:16.500 --> 2:16:18.500]  Whether it's small palates that protect your cell phone
[2:16:18.500 --> 2:16:20.500]  or big palates that protect laptops
[2:16:20.500 --> 2:16:22.500]  and iPads or big bags
[2:16:22.500 --> 2:16:24.500]  that promote whatever electronics you want to put in
[2:16:24.500 --> 2:16:26.500]  like desktop computers,
[2:16:26.500 --> 2:16:28.500]  it is all exclusively available
[2:16:28.500 --> 2:16:30.500]  at infowars.com
[2:16:30.500 --> 2:16:32.500]  under the Redux name.
[2:16:32.500 --> 2:16:34.500]  Redux is info wars,
[2:16:34.500 --> 2:16:36.500]  taking the highest quality products

[2:16:38.500 --> 2:16:40.500]  at infowars.com.
[2:16:40.500 --> 2:16:42.500]  In this insane world, you are crazy
[2:16:42.500 --> 2:16:44.500]  if you don't protect your signature,
[2:16:44.500 --> 2:16:46.500]  your identity from identity theft,
[2:16:46.500 --> 2:16:49.500]  hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.
[2:16:49.500 --> 2:16:52.500]  This is one of the hottest items out there today
[2:16:52.500 --> 2:16:56.500]  that's exclusively available at infowars.com.
[2:16:56.500 --> 2:16:59.500]  There is very little contemporary study
[2:16:59.500 --> 2:17:03.500]  in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[2:17:03.500 --> 2:17:06.500]  Not in communist China, not in Mexico,
[2:17:06.500 --> 2:17:09.500]  not in the United States, not anywhere.
[2:17:09.500 --> 2:17:12.500]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[2:17:12.500 --> 2:17:14.500]  And that's done by design.
[2:17:14.500 --> 2:17:17.500]  The large central banks that basically control the planet
[2:17:17.500 --> 2:17:20.500]  will penalize and target any academics
[2:17:20.500 --> 2:17:23.500]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment
[2:17:23.500 --> 2:17:25.500]  the founder of the Bilderberg Group,
[2:17:25.500 --> 2:17:27.500]  the trilateral commission of the United Nations,
[2:17:27.500 --> 2:17:30.500]  the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[2:17:30.500 --> 2:17:32.500]  Until 10 years ago, the media said
[2:17:32.500 --> 2:17:34.500]  the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg Group,
[2:17:34.500 --> 2:17:36.500]  didn't exist.
[2:17:36.500 --> 2:17:38.500]  Well, now the Bilderberg Group is public,
[2:17:38.500 --> 2:17:40.500]  its former head,
[2:17:40.500 --> 2:17:42.500]  it's on the steering committee, it's called Schwab,
[2:17:42.500 --> 2:17:44.500]  and he has set up the great reset
[2:17:44.500 --> 2:17:46.500]  in global government.
[2:17:46.500 --> 2:17:48.500]  And if, as a liberty movement worldwide,
[2:17:48.500 --> 2:17:50.500]  we don't address the globalist head-on
[2:17:50.500 --> 2:17:51.500]  about the second thing
[2:17:51.500 --> 2:17:53.500]  or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover,
[2:17:53.500 --> 2:17:55.500]  we don't have a shot.
[2:17:55.500 --> 2:17:57.500]  If you expose them, we can beat them easily.
[2:17:57.500 --> 2:18:00.500]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[2:18:00.500 --> 2:18:02.500]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts
[2:18:02.500 --> 2:18:04.500]  you refuse to accept.
[2:18:04.500 --> 2:18:06.500]  If you have a family member suffering
[2:18:06.500 --> 2:18:08.500]  from this degenerative mental condition,
[2:18:08.500 --> 2:18:10.500]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil
[2:18:10.500 --> 2:18:12.500]  from InfowarsStore.com.
[2:18:12.500 --> 2:18:14.500]  Studies have suggested that
[2:18:14.500 --> 2:18:16.500]  fish oils and fish oil supplementation
[2:18:16.500 --> 2:18:18.500]  can slightly lower blood pressure,
[2:18:18.500 --> 2:18:20.500]  decrease triglyceride levels,
[2:18:20.500 --> 2:18:22.500]  decrease the growth rate of plaque,
[2:18:22.500 --> 2:18:24.500]  and provide a soothing reduction
[2:18:24.500 --> 2:18:26.500]  in inflammatory responses
[2:18:26.500 --> 2:18:28.500]  in joints and the digestive system.
[2:18:28.500 --> 2:18:30.500]  Recent studies have suggested
[2:18:30.500 --> 2:18:32.500]  that high EPA and DHA
[2:18:32.500 --> 2:18:34.500]  fish oil can stimulate
[2:18:34.500 --> 2:18:36.500]  immune function by increasing
[2:18:36.500 --> 2:18:38.500]  the concentration and activity
[2:18:38.500 --> 2:18:40.500]  of immune cells.
[2:18:40.500 --> 2:18:42.500]  It worked for my family,
[2:18:42.500 --> 2:18:44.500]  and now I can have a logical
[2:18:44.500 --> 2:18:46.500]  and calm discussion about actual facts
[2:18:46.500 --> 2:18:48.500]  that pertain to reality.

[2:19:50.500 --> 2:19:52.500]  Wild, InfowarsStore.com.
[2:20:20.500 --> 2:20:22.500]  He's running against Ilhan Omar
[2:20:22.500 --> 2:20:24.500]  in Minnesota.
[2:20:24.500 --> 2:20:26.500]  His name is Roy Swine.
[2:20:26.500 --> 2:20:28.500]  He's our guest now in studio.
[2:20:28.500 --> 2:20:30.500]  Let's talk about her.
[2:20:30.500 --> 2:20:32.500]  We covered it last week.
[2:20:32.500 --> 2:20:34.500]  She got booed out of a Somali event
[2:20:34.500 --> 2:20:36.500]  saying get out of Minnesota,
[2:20:36.500 --> 2:20:38.500]  get out of America.
[2:20:38.500 --> 2:20:40.500]  I think that's a very good sign.
[2:20:40.500 --> 2:20:42.500]  Yeah, I would say so.
[2:20:42.500 --> 2:20:44.500]  Ultimately, the Somali people
[2:20:44.500 --> 2:20:46.500]  have not been...
[2:20:46.500 --> 2:20:48.500]  If you live in Minnesota,
[2:20:48.500 --> 2:20:50.500]  it's when cities, we have one of the biggest
[2:20:50.500 --> 2:20:52.500]  Somali immigrant communities in America,
[2:20:52.500 --> 2:20:54.500]  and it's been that way since I was a child
[2:20:54.500 --> 2:20:56.500]  in grade school, and they're not
[2:20:56.500 --> 2:20:58.500]  very well assimilated people.
[2:20:58.500 --> 2:21:00.500]  They don't really speak the language,
[2:21:00.500 --> 2:21:02.500]  so there are people that were vulnerable
[2:21:02.500 --> 2:21:04.500]  to have a prop and puppet
[2:21:04.500 --> 2:21:06.500]  put in front of them and represent them,
[2:21:06.500 --> 2:21:08.500]  and now that they're starting to learn
[2:21:08.500 --> 2:21:10.500]  a little bit more about some of these
[2:21:10.500 --> 2:21:12.500]  progressive policies that Ilhan Omar
[2:21:12.500 --> 2:21:14.500]  is promoting, they're not in alignment with it.
[2:21:14.500 --> 2:21:16.500]  Wow, that's huge.
[2:21:16.500 --> 2:21:18.500]  In Muslim culture, is it okay to be gay
[2:21:18.500 --> 2:21:20.500]  or to abort kids?
[2:21:20.500 --> 2:21:22.500]  It's just not a part of the Muslim faith.
[2:21:22.500 --> 2:21:24.500]  There are many problems with the Muslim faith
[2:21:24.500 --> 2:21:26.500]  and the Muslim doctrine in the way
[2:21:26.500 --> 2:21:28.500]  that it's practiced in modern times
[2:21:28.500 --> 2:21:30.500]  across the world, but by and large,
[2:21:30.500 --> 2:21:32.500]  just fundamentally, there is no
[2:21:32.500 --> 2:21:34.500]  homosexuality or abortion
[2:21:34.500 --> 2:21:36.500]  in Muslim culture.
[2:21:36.500 --> 2:21:38.500]  So, who does she really work for?
[2:21:38.500 --> 2:21:40.500]  Well, you gotta ask yourself
[2:21:40.500 --> 2:21:42.500]  who got out of Somalia, the same people
[2:21:42.500 --> 2:21:44.500]  who we left behind in Afghanistan.
[2:21:44.500 --> 2:21:46.500]  They were security state assets.
[2:21:46.500 --> 2:21:48.500]  So, you know, her dad
[2:21:48.500 --> 2:21:50.500]  was probably a security state asset
[2:21:50.500 --> 2:21:52.500]  and she was born and bred
[2:21:52.500 --> 2:21:54.500]  into a security state asset family
[2:21:54.500 --> 2:21:56.500]  and she popped up out of nowhere
[2:21:56.500 --> 2:21:58.500]  and all of her moves and actions
[2:21:58.500 --> 2:22:00.500]  say that she works for herself
[2:22:00.500 --> 2:22:02.500]  and that is kind of the globalist motif.
[2:22:02.500 --> 2:22:04.500]  They have no allegiance
[2:22:04.500 --> 2:22:06.500]  to any culture or nation.
[2:22:06.500 --> 2:22:08.500]  They are a cabal of
[2:22:08.500 --> 2:22:10.500]  independent opportunists.
[2:22:10.500 --> 2:22:12.500]  She is so arrogant.
[2:22:12.500 --> 2:22:14.500]  How can we get behind
[2:22:14.500 --> 2:22:16.500]  what you're doing to defeat her?
[2:22:16.500 --> 2:22:18.500]  Well, definitely you can go and donate,
[2:22:18.500 --> 2:22:20.500]  but the bigger issue is
[2:22:20.500 --> 2:22:22.500]  we have to fight
[2:22:22.500 --> 2:22:24.500]  off the controlled opposition
[2:22:24.500 --> 2:22:26.500]  and continue to call that out
[2:22:26.500 --> 2:22:28.500]  at every turn. I have to get through
[2:22:28.500 --> 2:22:30.500]  a very tough primary, so spread the word
[2:22:30.500 --> 2:22:32.500]  to your Minnesota CD5
[2:22:32.500 --> 2:22:34.500]  or Minnesotans in general
[2:22:34.500 --> 2:22:36.500]  about the race because
[2:22:36.500 --> 2:22:38.500]  very seldom does a
[2:22:38.500 --> 2:22:40.500]  candidate who wasn't endorsed
[2:22:40.500 --> 2:22:42.500]  by the party
[2:22:42.500 --> 2:22:44.500]  win a race in Minnesota.
[2:22:44.500 --> 2:22:46.500]  It has happened on some occasions and this is a race
[2:22:46.500 --> 2:22:48.500]  that is tracking in polls to say
[2:22:48.500 --> 2:22:50.500]  that I have a very, very strong chance
[2:22:50.500 --> 2:22:52.500]  of winning this primary just because of a lack
[2:22:52.500 --> 2:22:54.500]  of action and activity
[2:22:54.500 --> 2:22:56.500]  by my opponent, but
[2:22:56.500 --> 2:22:58.500]  my opponent was walked into
[2:22:58.500 --> 2:23:00.500]  the CD5 convention
[2:23:00.500 --> 2:23:02.500]  where the endorsement happens
[2:23:02.500 --> 2:23:04.500]  by the former CD chair
[2:23:04.500 --> 2:23:06.500]  and they all said globalism,
[2:23:06.500 --> 2:23:08.500]  the Fed, abortion,
[2:23:08.500 --> 2:23:10.500]  the church of LGBTQ
[2:23:10.500 --> 2:23:12.500]  all read and meet for the base.
[2:23:12.500 --> 2:23:14.500]  I live
[2:23:14.500 --> 2:23:16.500]  Minnesota and the Minnesota
[2:23:16.500 --> 2:23:18.500]  GOP as an outpost
[2:23:18.500 --> 2:23:20.500]  of Democrats.
[2:23:20.500 --> 2:23:22.500]  Absolutely, so
[2:23:22.500 --> 2:23:24.500]  as this awakening
[2:23:24.500 --> 2:23:26.500]  happening and starts unfolding
[2:23:26.500 --> 2:23:28.500]  how do you see the establishment trying to block
[2:23:28.500 --> 2:23:30.500]  and just ignoring what you're doing?
[2:23:30.500 --> 2:23:32.500]  Well, I mean, they're not that brazen
[2:23:32.500 --> 2:23:34.500]  and I guess
[2:23:34.500 --> 2:23:36.500]  what is
[2:23:36.500 --> 2:23:38.500]  a good strategy here going forward is that people
[2:23:38.500 --> 2:23:40.500]  who have prominent platforms
[2:23:40.500 --> 2:23:42.500]  independently of politics get into politics
[2:23:42.500 --> 2:23:44.500]  because it makes it a lot harder for the establishment
[2:23:44.500 --> 2:23:46.500]  to block them or ignore them.
[2:23:46.500 --> 2:23:48.500]  So the Minnesota GOP
[2:23:48.500 --> 2:23:50.500]  hasn't been able to come out right and say
[2:23:50.500 --> 2:23:52.500]  we don't like Royce or don't support Royce
[2:23:52.500 --> 2:23:54.500]  or, you know, they just kind of try and play
[2:23:54.500 --> 2:23:56.500]  the party
[2:23:56.500 --> 2:23:58.500]  template and landscape and throw
[2:23:58.500 --> 2:24:00.500]  everything off on that, but
[2:24:00.500 --> 2:24:02.500]  there couldn't be more contrast
[2:24:02.500 --> 2:24:04.500]  between me and my primary opponent
[2:24:04.500 --> 2:24:06.500]  and I don't think there could be any more contrast
[2:24:06.500 --> 2:24:08.500]  between true America first candidates
[2:24:08.500 --> 2:24:10.500]  in this election cycle
[2:24:10.500 --> 2:24:12.500]  and the establishment Republicans.
[2:24:12.500 --> 2:24:14.500]  Well, here's the good news, they're scared of you.
[2:24:14.500 --> 2:24:16.500]  And they know the future
[2:24:16.500 --> 2:24:18.500]  and so by running regardless you win
[2:24:18.500 --> 2:24:20.500]  what do you think
[2:24:20.500 --> 2:24:22.500]  just a big picture, a 35,000 foot view
[2:24:22.500 --> 2:24:24.500]  the Democrats are going to do with 118 days
[2:24:24.500 --> 2:24:26.500]  from the midterms
[2:24:26.500 --> 2:24:28.500]  and everybody's turning against them, what do you think they're going to do?
[2:24:30.500 --> 2:24:32.500]  Well, I mean, if it was me
[2:24:32.500 --> 2:24:34.500]  and I was them
[2:24:34.500 --> 2:24:36.500]  I'd be planning to cheat
[2:24:36.500 --> 2:24:38.500]  I mean, that's just
[2:24:38.500 --> 2:24:40.500]  I mean, you know, I just
[2:24:40.500 --> 2:24:42.500]  yeah, I would be planning to cheat
[2:24:42.500 --> 2:24:44.500]  if I were them, but I'm not
[2:24:44.500 --> 2:24:46.500]  and you know, I don't think that they're not a group
[2:24:46.500 --> 2:24:48.500]  that believe in fair play
[2:24:48.500 --> 2:24:50.500]  they believe that the ends justifies the means
[2:24:50.500 --> 2:24:52.500]  us American patriots, you know
[2:24:52.500 --> 2:24:54.500]  as a sportsman, a square game
[2:24:54.500 --> 2:24:56.500]  is baked into our culture
[2:24:56.500 --> 2:24:58.500]  whether you win or lose, win lose or draw
[2:24:58.500 --> 2:25:00.500]  a fair game is supposed to be
[2:25:00.500 --> 2:25:02.500]  a prerequisite of American competition
[2:25:02.500 --> 2:25:04.500]  and American
[2:25:04.500 --> 2:25:06.500]  values, that's kind of what America
[2:25:06.500 --> 2:25:08.500]  has been about the corporatocracy
[2:25:08.500 --> 2:25:10.500]  has hijacked that culture
[2:25:10.500 --> 2:25:12.500]  and they've made it a win
[2:25:12.500 --> 2:25:14.500]  by any means and that's kind of the motif
[2:25:14.500 --> 2:25:16.500]  that the globalists play at
[2:25:16.500 --> 2:25:18.500]  the global scale, but
[2:25:18.500 --> 2:25:20.500]  there's no way that they're going to be able
[2:25:20.500 --> 2:25:22.500]  to get through this midterm
[2:25:22.500 --> 2:25:24.500]  election with the momentum and the
[2:25:24.500 --> 2:25:26.500]  you know, the balls that they've dropped
[2:25:26.500 --> 2:25:28.500]  along the way in the first two years of this regime
[2:25:28.500 --> 2:25:30.500]  I agree, I mean, they meant
[2:25:30.500 --> 2:25:32.500]  to put Biden in to be a puppet, but he has
[2:25:32.500 --> 2:25:34.500]  fallen apart even worse
[2:25:34.500 --> 2:25:36.500]  than they thought he would. I think he's the fall guy
[2:25:36.500 --> 2:25:38.500]  I think he was always the cut out
[2:25:38.500 --> 2:25:40.500]  and I think that they, you know, they used him
[2:25:40.500 --> 2:25:42.500]  as a sort of transitory
[2:25:42.500 --> 2:25:44.500]  figure that would be easy to
[2:25:44.500 --> 2:25:46.500]  justify cutting out when the time was right
[2:25:46.500 --> 2:25:48.500]  and they plan to use him as a stop gap
[2:25:48.500 --> 2:25:50.500]  to go even more progressive in the future
[2:25:50.500 --> 2:25:52.500]  and you see that with the promotion of
[2:25:52.500 --> 2:25:54.500]  an AOC or Pete Buttigieg as
[2:25:54.500 --> 2:25:56.500]  potential future... I agree, so how do you
[2:25:56.500 --> 2:25:58.500]  see it in the next 118 days
[2:25:58.500 --> 2:26:00.500]  ahead of the midterms? What do they do to Biden?
[2:26:00.500 --> 2:26:02.500]  Because even the New York Times is like, we got to get rid of him
[2:26:02.500 --> 2:26:04.500]  so that's the big question, what happens?
[2:26:04.500 --> 2:26:06.500]  Maybe he gets sick, you know, maybe
[2:26:06.500 --> 2:26:08.500]  he resigns, maybe he steps
[2:26:08.500 --> 2:26:10.500]  away, a whole host of things
[2:26:10.500 --> 2:26:12.500]  could happen, but
[2:26:12.500 --> 2:26:14.500]  but I know that the
[2:26:14.500 --> 2:26:16.500]  momentum of the America First movement
[2:26:16.500 --> 2:26:18.500]  even in the black community where I come from, where people
[2:26:18.500 --> 2:26:20.500]  have traditionally voted Democrat
[2:26:20.500 --> 2:26:22.500]  they are completely open to not only
[2:26:22.500 --> 2:26:24.500]  voting Republican
[2:26:24.500 --> 2:26:26.500]  but actually understanding what the Democrats have done
[2:26:26.500 --> 2:26:28.500]  over the course of the past
[2:26:28.500 --> 2:26:30.500]  you know, three, four generations
[2:26:30.500 --> 2:26:32.500]  I think what you're saying is
[2:26:32.500 --> 2:26:34.500]  we're seeing the death of the Democratic Party
[2:26:34.500 --> 2:26:36.500]  right now, but like you said
[2:26:36.500 --> 2:26:38.500]  the Republican leadership is controlled, so what do you see coming out of that?
[2:26:38.500 --> 2:26:40.500]  Well, that is the real
[2:26:40.500 --> 2:26:42.500]  number one, the death of the Democrat Party
[2:26:42.500 --> 2:26:44.500]  is going to foster
[2:26:44.500 --> 2:26:46.500]  a desperation from the Democrats
[2:26:46.500 --> 2:26:48.500]  but also
[2:26:48.500 --> 2:26:50.500]  the worst thing that could happen
[2:26:50.500 --> 2:26:52.500]  is that we have a red wave
[2:26:52.500 --> 2:26:54.500]  in November
[2:26:54.500 --> 2:26:56.500]  and the majority of them be
[2:26:58.500 --> 2:27:00.500]  let's say
[2:27:00.500 --> 2:27:02.500]  spooks
[2:27:02.500 --> 2:27:04.500]  political spooks, right? They're not really
[2:27:04.500 --> 2:27:06.500]  America First candidates, but they ride the America First
[2:27:06.500 --> 2:27:08.500]  cultural momentum
[2:27:08.500 --> 2:27:10.500]  and narrative and I see that happening
[2:27:10.500 --> 2:27:12.500]  again, my primary opponent was draped in
[2:27:12.500 --> 2:27:14.500]  Donald Trump when she
[2:27:14.500 --> 2:27:16.500]  popped onto the scene
[2:27:16.500 --> 2:27:18.500]  she has used the America First platform at every
[2:27:18.500 --> 2:27:20.500]  turn when she can, but
[2:27:20.500 --> 2:27:22.500]  at her heart, in her heart
[2:27:22.500 --> 2:27:24.500]  she's a Democrat and I think
[2:27:24.500 --> 2:27:26.500]  there are a lot of people who may be running America First
[2:27:26.500 --> 2:27:28.500]  right now that we need to take
[2:27:28.500 --> 2:27:30.500]  a real strong look at vetting now. Well, that's right
[2:27:30.500 --> 2:27:32.500]  sure, go ahead.
[2:27:32.500 --> 2:27:34.500]  If somebody's saying that they're America First
[2:27:34.500 --> 2:27:36.500]  versus being a Democrat
[2:27:36.500 --> 2:27:38.500]  we'll take the America First candidate
[2:27:38.500 --> 2:27:40.500]  but let's hold them to
[2:27:40.500 --> 2:27:42.500]  their values and I think there's some
[2:27:42.500 --> 2:27:44.500]  clear dividing lines on some of these key issues
[2:27:44.500 --> 2:27:46.500]  that we should be
[2:27:46.500 --> 2:27:48.500]  very settled on. The Ukraine
[2:27:48.500 --> 2:27:50.500]  and the spending and the involvement is one
[2:27:50.500 --> 2:27:52.500]  the sanctity of life
[2:27:52.500 --> 2:27:54.500]  with abortion is another
[2:27:54.500 --> 2:27:56.500]  the expansion of government
[2:27:56.500 --> 2:27:58.500]  in general and the welfare state is probably the
[2:27:58.500 --> 2:28:00.500]  third and so
[2:28:00.500 --> 2:28:02.500]  there's some issues that we should have some litmus
[2:28:02.500 --> 2:28:04.500]  tests on at this point
[2:28:04.500 --> 2:28:06.500]  about which people are really America First.
[2:28:06.500 --> 2:28:08.500]  Roy Swine, I totally agree with you
[2:28:08.500 --> 2:28:10.500]  and
[2:28:10.500 --> 2:28:12.500]  whether they steal it this time or the next
[2:28:12.500 --> 2:28:14.500]  I just see victory
[2:28:14.500 --> 2:28:16.500]  at every level, the awakening is huge
[2:28:16.500 --> 2:28:18.500]  but
[2:28:18.500 --> 2:28:20.500]  at the same time they might start a war with Russia
[2:28:20.500 --> 2:28:22.500]  before we ever fix things.
[2:28:22.500 --> 2:28:24.500]  To me the most important thing is that
[2:28:24.500 --> 2:28:26.500]  we continue to spread
[2:28:26.500 --> 2:28:28.500]  the word, a genuine word
[2:28:28.500 --> 2:28:30.500]  about where the
[2:28:30.500 --> 2:28:32.500]  spirit of this country is going
[2:28:32.500 --> 2:28:34.500]  and that way if they cheat
[2:28:34.500 --> 2:28:36.500]  the sentiment
[2:28:36.500 --> 2:28:38.500]  will resonate and be there
[2:28:38.500 --> 2:28:40.500]  within the people that they feel cheated. Up until this point
[2:28:40.500 --> 2:28:42.500]  people don't feel cheated
[2:28:42.500 --> 2:28:44.500]  because many people don't pay attention.
[2:28:44.500 --> 2:28:46.500]  All right, you're going to host the fourth hour
[2:28:46.500 --> 2:28:48.500]  but when we come back, don't listen to me
[2:28:48.500 --> 2:28:50.500]  I want you to turn loose
[2:28:50.500 --> 2:28:52.500]  to 2 million people an hour

[2:33:02.500 --> 2:33:13.220]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:13.220 --> 2:33:17.340]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[2:33:17.340 --> 2:33:21.660]  Resistance to Titans is obedience to God.
[2:33:21.660 --> 2:33:24.660]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:24.660 --> 2:33:33.660]  Voice likes our guest in studio to be hosting the 4th hour today and I said what do you want to get as he said inflation and the economy.
[2:33:33.660 --> 2:33:36.660]  I mentioned this earlier. Here's some of the headlines.
[2:33:36.660 --> 2:33:38.660]  Democrats demand 650 billion.
[2:33:38.660 --> 2:33:40.660]  What's 68 billion so far?
[2:33:40.660 --> 2:33:41.660]  Hell, we put up with that.
[2:33:41.660 --> 2:33:48.660]  Why not 650 billion in IMF and World Bank money for them to launder?
[2:33:48.660 --> 2:33:50.660]  Inflation hits a 40 year high.
[2:33:50.660 --> 2:33:52.660]  What's next for shoppers?
[2:33:52.660 --> 2:33:54.660]  U.S. inflation exploding.
[2:33:54.660 --> 2:33:59.660]  World economic forum vows to buy up Dutch farmers after barring them to farm.
[2:33:59.660 --> 2:34:03.660]  I mean it's just insane level criminal activity.
[2:34:03.660 --> 2:34:05.660]  U.S. consumer prices soaring June.
[2:34:05.660 --> 2:34:07.660]  Americans real wages fall.
[2:34:07.660 --> 2:34:09.660]  15 straight months.
[2:34:09.660 --> 2:34:11.660]  Why Sri Lanka is facing the worst economic crisis?
[2:34:11.660 --> 2:34:15.660]  Two years ago they put the same policies the U.N. wants in.
[2:34:15.660 --> 2:34:16.660]  This is insane.
[2:34:16.660 --> 2:34:21.660]  Royce White inflation, the economy, the great reset.
[2:34:21.660 --> 2:34:24.660]  Well it's stealing is what it is.
[2:34:24.660 --> 2:34:27.660]  They're stealing from the American people.
[2:34:27.660 --> 2:34:33.660]  And anytime you spend against the deficit like we have in this country right now,
[2:34:33.660 --> 2:34:35.660]  it's stealing.
[2:34:35.660 --> 2:34:37.660]  It's criminal.
[2:34:37.660 --> 2:34:43.660]  And the bigger issue is when your government's stealing everybody's stealing.
[2:34:43.660 --> 2:34:47.660]  And we talk about the cultural decay and we look across the country at crime rates
[2:34:47.660 --> 2:34:51.660]  and all of the things that are going on around crime.
[2:34:51.660 --> 2:34:54.660]  The black community is afflicted with it more than any or minority communities
[2:34:54.660 --> 2:34:57.660]  which they say they want to try and save and lift up.
[2:34:57.660 --> 2:35:03.660]  But all of these policies are aimed at chaos, are aimed at self-destruction
[2:35:03.660 --> 2:35:07.660]  and a plan to manage destruction and decline of this country.
[2:35:07.660 --> 2:35:12.660]  It's quite impressive that they've been able to get the American people to believe
[2:35:12.660 --> 2:35:15.660]  they're working in their interest.
[2:35:15.660 --> 2:35:17.660]  Continue.
[2:35:17.660 --> 2:35:24.660]  I come from a community where people are just radically, radically high with materialism.
[2:35:24.660 --> 2:35:29.660]  The radical materialism has reached a level that's almost absurd.
[2:35:29.660 --> 2:35:34.660]  If you know more about your favorite TV series on Netflix
[2:35:34.660 --> 2:35:39.660]  than you do the financial policies of this country or the Federal Reserve, let's say.
[2:35:39.660 --> 2:35:45.660]  If you know 10, 11, 12 Netflix series, Netflix original series
[2:35:45.660 --> 2:35:48.660]  and you don't even know what the IMF is and that's not this audience
[2:35:48.660 --> 2:35:51.660]  but a good portion of America is this way.
[2:35:51.660 --> 2:35:53.660]  They're in lawland.
[2:35:53.660 --> 2:35:55.660]  They're in bliss.
[2:35:55.660 --> 2:35:57.660]  And bliss is not the same as peace.
[2:35:57.660 --> 2:36:00.660]  And I see it all the time.
[2:36:00.660 --> 2:36:05.660]  In my own immediate community, in my own immediate world, in my own immediate life with friends, family,
[2:36:05.660 --> 2:36:09.660]  I wear the shirt, the United States of the Federal Reserve, they have no clue.
[2:36:09.660 --> 2:36:16.660]  But they're curious and I think there's an optimism to have about people are starting to wake up
[2:36:16.660 --> 2:36:18.660]  but we're in a crisis right now.
[2:36:18.660 --> 2:36:20.660]  This crisis is right now.
[2:36:20.660 --> 2:36:22.660]  It's on.
[2:36:22.660 --> 2:36:26.660]  They are not kidding around and they're going to throw a Hail Mary.
[2:36:26.660 --> 2:36:27.660]  Well, that's the thing.
[2:36:27.660 --> 2:36:28.660]  They wanted to collapse.
[2:36:28.660 --> 2:36:30.660]  They wouldn't get blamed for it to be the saviors.
[2:36:30.660 --> 2:36:31.660]  But it's happening.
[2:36:31.660 --> 2:36:34.660]  They're getting the blame with educated people but they're still moving forward.
[2:36:34.660 --> 2:36:36.660]  This is going to be explosive.
[2:36:36.660 --> 2:36:40.660]  All signs point to a calamity.
[2:36:40.660 --> 2:36:50.660]  And, you know, in most times in history, people have said of those who prophesize calamity
[2:36:50.660 --> 2:36:53.660]  that we're just fear mongering.
[2:36:53.660 --> 2:36:55.660]  But this is not fear mongering.
[2:36:55.660 --> 2:37:00.660]  This has been the buildup of many turning points that didn't end in calamity
[2:37:00.660 --> 2:37:04.660]  that now are streamlined towards calamity.
[2:37:04.660 --> 2:37:09.660]  And they're saying the policy of Klaus Schwab is you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing.
[2:37:09.660 --> 2:37:12.660]  I mean, why do you think they're so honest about that?
[2:37:12.660 --> 2:37:16.660]  Because they've done a very good job at making people like you
[2:37:16.660 --> 2:37:19.660]  or painting people like you out to be conspiracy theorists.
[2:37:19.660 --> 2:37:21.660]  And they've done a very good job.
[2:37:21.660 --> 2:37:24.660]  Look, the entire mainstream establishment is in on it.
[2:37:24.660 --> 2:37:26.660]  And you know that better than any.
[2:37:26.660 --> 2:37:33.660]  But I think a lot of people still have a tough time believing that the CIA went on the record and said
[2:37:33.660 --> 2:37:38.660]  we'll know our disinformation campaign is complete when everything the American public believes is false.
[2:37:38.660 --> 2:37:40.660]  And they are very close to that.
[2:37:40.660 --> 2:37:49.660]  Now, there's a small thread of divinity that's playing out right now of people that are so moved and motivated by the truth
[2:37:49.660 --> 2:37:52.660]  that they won't stand in alignment with the establishment.
[2:37:52.660 --> 2:37:57.660]  And that's why we're having that counter movement of awakening and Donald Trump helped move that along.
[2:37:57.660 --> 2:37:59.660]  You've been helping move that along for a long time.
[2:37:59.660 --> 2:38:00.660]  Bannon's helping move that along.
[2:38:00.660 --> 2:38:03.660]  There are a number of people across the spectrum that are helping move that along.
[2:38:03.660 --> 2:38:05.660]  And I'm just proud to be one of them.
[2:38:05.660 --> 2:38:08.660]  And I'm glad to hear that Roger forgives Steve Bannon.
[2:38:08.660 --> 2:38:09.660]  I like both guys.
[2:38:09.660 --> 2:38:14.660]  And we need to just stop our differences and move forward.
[2:38:14.660 --> 2:38:15.660]  Yeah, I thought that was cool.
[2:38:15.660 --> 2:38:20.660]  I was watching in the back and I don't know the history really of behind Steve and Roger's beef.
[2:38:20.660 --> 2:38:23.660]  But Steve brought me into the movement and I give him his credit for that.
[2:38:23.660 --> 2:38:25.660]  I think Bannon does great work.
[2:38:25.660 --> 2:38:27.660]  And Jesus said you judge you three by its fruits.
[2:38:27.660 --> 2:38:32.660]  You know, he's my mentor and he's a friend and I think he's an American hero.
[2:38:32.660 --> 2:38:37.660]  And without him, I wouldn't be in this American populist movement.
[2:38:37.660 --> 2:38:39.660]  He's definitely got big balls.
[2:38:39.660 --> 2:38:42.660]  I joke that I'm a little further right than Bannon is.
[2:38:42.660 --> 2:38:44.660]  Me and him joke about that all the time.
[2:38:44.660 --> 2:38:51.660]  I consider myself an American first Christian sovereignist, which by Joe Biden standards would make me a domestic terrorist.
[2:38:51.660 --> 2:38:55.660]  But I find what that means.
[2:38:55.660 --> 2:39:01.660]  I believe the scope of governance is just way out of control on on many levels.
[2:39:01.660 --> 2:39:03.660]  The scope of governance has to shrink down.
[2:39:03.660 --> 2:39:11.660]  And the best way to shrink it down is to go back to our founding values, which were Christian values.
[2:39:11.660 --> 2:39:15.660]  And exactly, we're not imposing him, but we're going to follow him ourselves.
[2:39:15.660 --> 2:39:17.660]  Well, I heard somebody say this the other day.
[2:39:17.660 --> 2:39:19.660]  I was your guy, Rogan, he was on.
[2:39:19.660 --> 2:39:25.660]  I don't know if this was a recent episode, but the guy who he's on with often his name is Duncan, maybe little, little high pitch voice.
[2:39:25.660 --> 2:39:26.660]  Funny guy.
[2:39:26.660 --> 2:39:27.660]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:39:27.660 --> 2:39:31.660]  Anyway, you know, they were talking about the Roe v. Wade thing.
[2:39:31.660 --> 2:39:38.660]  And both of them kind of insinuated that us far right wing Christian fundamentalists want to go to theocracy.
[2:39:38.660 --> 2:39:42.660]  We don't want a theocracy, Joe Duncan.
[2:39:42.660 --> 2:39:44.660]  We don't want an anti got theocracy.
[2:39:44.660 --> 2:39:45.660]  There's plenty of people.
[2:39:45.660 --> 2:39:53.660]  There's plenty of room for people in this movement that don't believe in God or don't have the lefts trying to make us conform to them.
[2:39:53.660 --> 2:39:54.660]  Exactly.
[2:39:54.660 --> 2:39:55.660]  But this is what I'm saying.
[2:39:55.660 --> 2:39:58.660]  There's plenty of your faith, your journey in faith.
[2:39:58.660 --> 2:40:05.660]  If you're a true Christian and believe in Christianity, fundamentally, a person's individual faith in God is a personal journey.
[2:40:05.660 --> 2:40:09.660]  And many people fall short of that on multiple occasions across a lifetime.
[2:40:09.660 --> 2:40:17.660]  We don't want every we don't want to start to move people out of the movement or or create a wall for people who don't have faith or don't believe in God.
[2:40:17.660 --> 2:40:26.660]  But we don't want people who are anti God and we don't want Satanists and the and the people who are on the fence like Joe even who I respect and I love him.
[2:40:26.660 --> 2:40:27.660]  He does a great job.
[2:40:27.660 --> 2:40:32.660]  But he is absent to the prevalence of a true satanic effort.
[2:40:32.660 --> 2:40:34.660]  He doesn't admit there's evil out there.
[2:40:34.660 --> 2:40:35.660]  And I know Joe.
[2:40:35.660 --> 2:40:36.660]  Well, that's a problem.
[2:40:36.660 --> 2:40:38.660]  And I don't want to say we've had a falling out.
[2:40:38.660 --> 2:40:39.660]  We haven't.
[2:40:39.660 --> 2:40:40.660]  But he moved to Austin two years ago.
[2:40:40.660 --> 2:40:41.660]  We hang out all the time.
[2:40:41.660 --> 2:40:44.660]  But he just he just he wants to play both sides.
[2:40:44.660 --> 2:40:47.660]  And I've told him that and he knows he's doing that.
[2:40:47.660 --> 2:40:48.660]  Yeah.
[2:40:48.660 --> 2:40:49.660]  No.
[2:40:49.660 --> 2:40:54.660]  And again, Joe, Joe stood in the breach and provided a platform for information.
[2:40:54.660 --> 2:40:57.660]  When it was do or die time, exposed the vaccine and covered.
[2:40:57.660 --> 2:41:03.660]  But even before, I mean, even going back to when you first went on the on Joe's show, he was holding the breach to
[2:41:03.660 --> 2:41:09.660]  provide a counter for the onslaught and avalanche of globalist establishment information.
[2:41:09.660 --> 2:41:11.660]  Still, we are where we are today.
[2:41:11.660 --> 2:41:19.660]  And if you don't recognize the presence of evil, we cannot be properly armed to fight against it.
[2:41:19.660 --> 2:41:20.660]  You're right.
[2:41:20.660 --> 2:41:22.660]  He never recognizes his organized.
[2:41:22.660 --> 2:41:23.660]  There's nothing wrong.
[2:41:23.660 --> 2:41:25.660]  If you don't believe in God, that's a personal thing.
[2:41:25.660 --> 2:41:28.660]  But you can't be anti God and you can't be a Satanist.
[2:41:28.660 --> 2:41:34.660]  And the promotion of the Church of LGBTQ, as you explained a week back or a couple weeks back where they're addressing
[2:41:34.660 --> 2:41:39.660]  200 pound men up as space demons and putting them up next to little kids at schools.
[2:41:39.660 --> 2:41:46.660]  And the the open promotion of genocide and abortion are explicitly anti God and Satanic.
[2:41:46.660 --> 2:41:47.660]  And if we do that, we're cursed.
[2:41:47.660 --> 2:41:48.660]  You can't be.
[2:41:48.660 --> 2:41:53.660]  I don't even get the argument and Duncan goes, you know, Duncan sitting there and he says.
[2:41:53.660 --> 2:41:56.660]  You got to let women do what they want to do with their body.
[2:41:56.660 --> 2:41:58.660]  What about the baby's body?
[2:41:58.660 --> 2:42:00.660]  I mean, that's I don't even get the argument.
[2:42:00.660 --> 2:42:01.660]  And what about the left?
[2:42:01.660 --> 2:42:02.660]  It's saying it's a sacrament.
[2:42:02.660 --> 2:42:05.660]  That's what killed him is they admit we want to kill babies.
[2:42:05.660 --> 2:42:09.660]  What about the fact that probably half of the 63 million abortions were women?
[2:42:09.660 --> 2:42:13.660]  So women only have rights if they're born and given a gender.
[2:42:13.660 --> 2:42:15.660]  So you have to be identified.
[2:42:15.660 --> 2:42:20.660]  You have to be assigned a gender post birth to have human rights or civil rights or American rights.
[2:42:20.660 --> 2:42:21.660]  Now, you're right.
[2:42:21.660 --> 2:42:23.660]  It's an attack on our rights overall.
[2:42:23.660 --> 2:42:24.660]  All right.
[2:42:24.660 --> 2:42:25.660]  Royce White's our guest.
[2:42:25.660 --> 2:42:27.660]  He's hosting the fourth hour.
[2:42:27.660 --> 2:42:29.660]  We're going to come back and talk about the economy.
[2:42:29.660 --> 2:42:30.660]  Talk about the election.
[2:42:30.660 --> 2:42:35.660]  Talk about the LGBT and men and women's sports and so much more straight ahead.
[2:42:35.660 --> 2:42:37.660]  Infowars.com.
[2:42:37.660 --> 2:42:38.660]  Tomorrow's news today.
[2:42:38.660 --> 2:42:44.660]  And check him out at RoyceWhite.substack.com and RoyceWhite.us.
[2:42:44.660 --> 2:42:47.660]  He's running for Congress against that monster Ilhan Omar.
[2:42:47.660 --> 2:42:49.660]  We don't get behind him.
[2:42:49.660 --> 2:42:51.660]  You just attacking your own self and your own family.
[2:42:51.660 --> 2:42:52.660]  We'll be right back.
[2:42:52.660 --> 2:42:57.660]  Stay with us.
[2:43:53.660 --> 2:43:55.660]  Ultimate turmeric formula.
[2:44:01.660 --> 2:44:02.660]  Granny Do Right.
[2:44:02.660 --> 2:44:03.660]  Granny Do Right.
[2:44:03.660 --> 2:44:04.660]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:44:04.660 --> 2:44:05.660]  Go ahead.
[2:44:05.660 --> 2:44:06.660]  Challenge.
[2:44:06.660 --> 2:44:08.660]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[2:44:08.660 --> 2:44:14.660]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[2:44:14.660 --> 2:44:18.660]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[2:44:18.660 --> 2:44:24.660]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[2:44:24.660 --> 2:44:26.660]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[2:44:26.660 --> 2:44:31.660]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know,
[2:44:31.660 --> 2:44:35.660]  well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[2:44:35.660 --> 2:44:38.660]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[2:44:38.660 --> 2:44:44.660]  But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is the ticket.
[2:44:44.660 --> 2:44:45.660]  This is working.
[2:44:45.660 --> 2:44:46.660]  This is wonderful.
[2:44:46.660 --> 2:44:50.660]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[2:44:50.660 --> 2:45:17.660]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:45:20.660 --> 2:45:23.660]  I don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this show.
[2:45:23.660 --> 2:45:28.660]  It's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[2:45:28.660 --> 2:45:34.660]  To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[2:45:34.660 --> 2:45:39.660]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[2:45:39.660 --> 2:45:45.660]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com.
[2:45:45.660 --> 2:45:57.660]  Or call 833-904-285-833-904-285.
[2:45:57.660 --> 2:46:03.660]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[2:46:03.660 --> 2:46:07.660]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[2:46:07.660 --> 2:46:11.660]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[2:46:11.660 --> 2:46:16.660]  If you agree with everything, you might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[2:46:16.660 --> 2:46:19.660]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[2:46:19.660 --> 2:46:20.660]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[2:46:20.660 --> 2:46:25.660]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, Infowarsstore.com is where to get them, folks.
[2:46:25.660 --> 2:46:27.660]  And we do have the best supplements.
[2:46:27.660 --> 2:46:32.660]  I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information,
[2:46:32.660 --> 2:46:36.660]  we do the best with our supplements as well.
[2:46:36.660 --> 2:46:38.660]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[2:46:38.660 --> 2:46:40.660]  Folks, this is a joke.
[2:46:40.660 --> 2:46:42.660]  This thing away, it's 75% off.
[2:46:42.660 --> 2:46:45.660]  By the way, it works for me, in case you haven't noticed.
[2:46:45.660 --> 2:46:48.660]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.
[2:46:48.660 --> 2:46:51.660]  Quite well, I might add.
[2:46:51.660 --> 2:46:55.660]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[2:46:55.660 --> 2:47:11.660]  Go and see him quite often now.
[2:47:25.660 --> 2:47:29.660]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[2:47:29.660 --> 2:47:31.660]  Everybody knows...
[2:47:31.660 --> 2:47:33.660]  Royce White's our guest in the studio.
[2:47:33.660 --> 2:47:36.660]  He's about to host the fourth hour today on Alex Jones.
[2:47:36.660 --> 2:47:37.660]  Thanks for joining us.
[2:47:37.660 --> 2:47:39.660]  Royce, I want to hit some other issues,
[2:47:39.660 --> 2:47:42.660]  but what are you going to cover when you host the next hour?
[2:47:42.660 --> 2:47:44.660]  Sacred Honor National Honor.
[2:47:44.660 --> 2:47:48.660]  I'm just going to go off on an hour about the loss of Sacred Honor National Honor.
[2:47:48.660 --> 2:47:52.660]  In my experience, 31 years of how we got to this place, personal experience,
[2:47:52.660 --> 2:47:56.660]  I'll probably talk a bit about Ilhan, Joe Biden, I want to touch on Gaddafi,
[2:47:56.660 --> 2:47:59.660]  I want to touch on some of the security state and deep state,
[2:47:59.660 --> 2:48:02.660]  because I really believe that the number one enemy of the American people
[2:48:02.660 --> 2:48:05.660]  are the security state, the deep state, and the administrative state.
[2:48:05.660 --> 2:48:09.660]  And the good news is, ten years ago, five years ago, that wasn't front and center.
[2:48:09.660 --> 2:48:10.660]  It's front and center now.
[2:48:10.660 --> 2:48:13.660]  Oh, right out there in the open, yeah.
[2:48:13.660 --> 2:48:15.660]  What do you think is going to happen in the midterms?
[2:48:15.660 --> 2:48:19.660]  What do you think is going to happen with Trump?
[2:48:19.660 --> 2:48:26.660]  Well, Donald Trump's in a very unique position to cast a great hand
[2:48:26.660 --> 2:48:30.660]  in saving this nation or putting this nation back on track,
[2:48:30.660 --> 2:48:33.660]  but he can't do it by just being him.
[2:48:33.660 --> 2:48:37.660]  He, like all of us, are going to have to dig deep and find a transcendent place
[2:48:37.660 --> 2:48:41.660]  to win this next round.
[2:48:41.660 --> 2:48:45.660]  It starts with the midterms, but going into 2024,
[2:48:45.660 --> 2:48:49.660]  there are some decisions that he's going to have to make even about the people
[2:48:49.660 --> 2:48:53.660]  who are around him in order for us to be victorious
[2:48:53.660 --> 2:48:58.660]  and to really jump over the hurdles in front of us.
[2:48:58.660 --> 2:49:00.660]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[2:49:00.660 --> 2:49:02.660]  It's such an epic moment.
[2:49:02.660 --> 2:49:04.660]  The globalists said they'd shut the economy out to bring us to heel,
[2:49:04.660 --> 2:49:06.660]  but they're going to get to blame for it now.
[2:49:06.660 --> 2:49:08.660]  It's not going the way they want it, in my view.
[2:49:08.660 --> 2:49:12.660]  How do you see their great reset unfolding?
[2:49:12.660 --> 2:49:16.660]  Well, I think the three heralds are going to have to be violence,
[2:49:16.660 --> 2:49:19.660]  whether that be civil unrest or war.
[2:49:19.660 --> 2:49:24.660]  Those are the two horns of a violent outbreak, famine,
[2:49:24.660 --> 2:49:30.660]  which is the product or result of a currency collapse and plague.
[2:49:30.660 --> 2:49:34.660]  And we may get to a place where,
[2:49:34.660 --> 2:49:39.660]  and I think we already are at this place where just all out technocratic dystopia
[2:49:39.660 --> 2:49:43.660]  holds the people in place, but those other three are going to be the way to
[2:49:43.660 --> 2:49:45.660]  expedite authoritarianism.
[2:49:45.660 --> 2:49:47.660]  What do you make of the Hunter Biden?
[2:49:47.660 --> 2:49:49.660]  I'm sure you look at some of it.
[2:49:49.660 --> 2:49:51.660]  It's a crackhead.
[2:49:51.660 --> 2:49:54.660]  Look, if you do crack, you're a crackhead.
[2:49:54.660 --> 2:49:59.660]  I mean, I don't understand what the toss-up is about it.
[2:49:59.660 --> 2:50:03.660]  And him being a crackhead per se is not an indictment of Joe Biden.
[2:50:03.660 --> 2:50:06.660]  I mean, I have four kids myself, and I have friends,
[2:50:06.660 --> 2:50:09.660]  and I have people who have been on drugs and have lived lifestyles.
[2:50:09.660 --> 2:50:12.660]  I don't agree with, and it can all be blamed on their parents.
[2:50:12.660 --> 2:50:18.660]  However, the attempt from this regime and the establishment to protect Hunter Biden
[2:50:18.660 --> 2:50:21.660]  is an indictment on Joe Biden and the establishment.
[2:50:21.660 --> 2:50:23.660]  If I was Joe Biden, I would come out and say, listen,
[2:50:23.660 --> 2:50:28.660]  this guy's, you know, my kid's a bad apple and I don't agree with his behavior.
[2:50:28.660 --> 2:50:30.660]  Well, yeah, we've got the video effect.
[2:50:30.660 --> 2:50:31.660]  Try to queue it up.
[2:50:31.660 --> 2:50:33.660]  It's Joe Biden in the Senate saying,
[2:50:33.660 --> 2:50:37.660]  if we catch you with a dime size, we're going to put you in jail for five years,
[2:50:37.660 --> 2:50:41.660]  then his son's got backpacks full of it, and that's okay.
[2:50:41.660 --> 2:50:42.660]  That's sick.
[2:50:42.660 --> 2:50:44.660]  The rules don't apply to them.
[2:50:44.660 --> 2:50:51.660]  And that's also the message that's being sent from January 6th is,
[2:50:51.660 --> 2:50:53.660]  we can do what we want.
[2:50:53.660 --> 2:50:57.660]  You, the people, are our subjects, and we are living in a surf society,
[2:50:57.660 --> 2:51:03.660]  and they view themselves as the lords of a monarch, monarch England or Europe.
[2:51:03.660 --> 2:51:04.660]  And I agree with you.
[2:51:04.660 --> 2:51:07.660]  So what are they going to do as everybody turns against them, which is happening now?
[2:51:07.660 --> 2:51:09.660]  They still seem to be delusional.
[2:51:09.660 --> 2:51:11.660]  Like January 6th has almost no viewers.
[2:51:11.660 --> 2:51:12.660]  Whole show, it's backfiring on them.
[2:51:12.660 --> 2:51:13.660]  They don't care.
[2:51:13.660 --> 2:51:14.660]  They just double down.
[2:51:14.660 --> 2:51:16.660]  Yeah, they got to crank up the propaganda,
[2:51:16.660 --> 2:51:18.660]  and they're going to have to crank up the chaos.
[2:51:18.660 --> 2:51:23.660]  And, you know, that's the one thing that makes me fearful is
[2:51:23.660 --> 2:51:29.660]  because the narrative is not sticking and people are starting to wake up.
[2:51:29.660 --> 2:51:35.660]  You can only assume that they're going to try and elevate the manipulation
[2:51:35.660 --> 2:51:40.660]  and try and snake their way or create a workaround for their end goal,
[2:51:40.660 --> 2:51:43.660]  or they're going to have to just go all out for it right now in the two-minute drill.
[2:51:43.660 --> 2:51:46.660]  And that two-minute drill is scary.
[2:51:46.660 --> 2:51:49.660]  And his monkeypox, that was a brief scare.
[2:51:49.660 --> 2:51:52.660]  But, you know, we know that the bioweapons are on deck.
[2:51:52.660 --> 2:51:55.660]  We know that the technocratic dystopia is right around the corner,
[2:51:55.660 --> 2:51:57.660]  if not already in our house today,
[2:51:57.660 --> 2:52:00.660]  with the security state and the surveillance and all of these things.
[2:52:00.660 --> 2:52:04.660]  So, it won't be long before the electronic payments,
[2:52:04.660 --> 2:52:08.660]  and all of that stuff is going to be predicated on your subservience
[2:52:08.660 --> 2:52:11.660]  and surrender to the New World Order.
[2:52:11.660 --> 2:52:13.660]  I totally agree with you.
[2:52:13.660 --> 2:52:17.660]  Since we mentioned, here's that clip of Senator Biden saying,
[2:52:17.660 --> 2:52:22.660]  five years in prison for a tiny piece of crack, and then his son is a crack yet. Here's the video.
[2:52:22.660 --> 2:52:29.660]  If you have a piece of crack cocaine,
[2:52:29.660 --> 2:52:33.660]  no bigger than this quarter that I'm holding in my hand,
[2:52:33.660 --> 2:52:35.660]  one quarter of one dollar,
[2:52:35.660 --> 2:52:39.660]  we passed a law through the leadership of Senator Thurman and myself and others.
[2:52:39.660 --> 2:52:42.660]  A law that says, if you're caught with that,
[2:52:42.660 --> 2:52:47.660]  you go to jail for five years.
[2:52:47.660 --> 2:52:49.660]  You get no probation.
[2:52:49.660 --> 2:52:55.660]  You get nothing other than five years in jail.
[2:52:55.660 --> 2:52:57.660]  Judge doesn't have a choice.
[2:52:57.660 --> 2:52:59.660]  Under our four-factor statutes,
[2:52:59.660 --> 2:53:04.660]  you can, the government can, take everything you own,
[2:53:04.660 --> 2:53:08.660]  everything from your car to your house, your bank account,
[2:53:08.660 --> 2:53:13.660]  not merely what they confiscate in terms of the dollars from the transaction
[2:53:13.660 --> 2:53:16.660]  that you've just got caught engaging in.
[2:53:16.660 --> 2:53:18.660]  They can take everything.
[2:53:18.660 --> 2:53:21.660]  I don't care why they've become a sociopath.
[2:53:21.660 --> 2:53:26.660]  We have an obligation to cordon them off from the rest of society.
[2:53:26.660 --> 2:53:28.660]  They are in jail.
[2:53:28.660 --> 2:53:33.660]  Away from my mother, your husband, our families.
[2:53:33.660 --> 2:53:38.660]  So I don't want to ask, what made them do this?
[2:53:38.660 --> 2:53:42.660]  They must be taken off the street.
[2:53:42.660 --> 2:53:44.660]  Bryce?
[2:53:44.660 --> 2:53:47.660]  Yeah, man, that's hard to watch as a black man.
[2:53:47.660 --> 2:53:50.660]  And I don't want to double down or dig into race
[2:53:50.660 --> 2:53:52.660]  because I think race is the ultimate.
[2:53:52.660 --> 2:53:55.660]  But the CIA did target black communities in L.A. and everywhere else
[2:53:55.660 --> 2:53:56.660]  with it.
[2:53:56.660 --> 2:53:58.660]  That's the time it was happening.
[2:53:58.660 --> 2:54:02.660]  He was running it with the KKK Grand Wizard, Robert Berg.
[2:54:02.660 --> 2:54:04.660]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[2:54:04.660 --> 2:54:07.660]  And then they call us racists because we support freedom.
[2:54:07.660 --> 2:54:10.660]  The problem with that, Joe Biden's a Republican.
[2:54:10.660 --> 2:54:12.660]  Yeah.
[2:54:12.660 --> 2:54:16.660]  And, you know, one of the big issues, I think, culturally in this country right now,
[2:54:16.660 --> 2:54:20.660]  let's say with the black community, for example, or the drug epidemic,
[2:54:20.660 --> 2:54:24.660]  and I do feel personal sense of responsibility and connection to the black community
[2:54:24.660 --> 2:54:31.660]  and how we currently plague this country with our having not risen up to the call
[2:54:31.660 --> 2:54:34.660]  of the duty as American citizens.
[2:54:34.660 --> 2:54:36.660]  But make no mistake.
[2:54:36.660 --> 2:54:39.660]  I mean, there is blame, but when it's targeted, you got to, like, there's a target.
[2:54:39.660 --> 2:54:41.660]  Make no mistake about it.
[2:54:41.660 --> 2:54:44.660]  The black community is in the condition it's in
[2:54:44.660 --> 2:54:48.660]  because at one point in this country's history, and that was the tail end of it,
[2:54:48.660 --> 2:54:51.660]  but that was the tail end of it,
[2:54:51.660 --> 2:54:55.660]  our security state was more afraid of black political organization
[2:54:55.660 --> 2:55:01.660]  than it was black on black violence or black, black drug addiction
[2:55:01.660 --> 2:55:04.660]  or criminal or black crime.
[2:55:04.660 --> 2:55:06.660]  And I agree.
[2:55:06.660 --> 2:55:10.660]  That's why it's so exciting to see so many great populist black leaders rising.
[2:55:10.660 --> 2:55:12.660]  That's beautiful.
[2:55:12.660 --> 2:55:15.660]  And I'm trying to bring that ministry of truth into the belly of the beast,
[2:55:15.660 --> 2:55:17.660]  and it is a beast.
[2:55:17.660 --> 2:55:20.660]  It is a place where people have become radically detached from faith,
[2:55:20.660 --> 2:55:24.660]  from sacred honor, from love and hope.
[2:55:24.660 --> 2:55:27.660]  That's true. What was done to the black community is the blueprint for everybody.
[2:55:27.660 --> 2:55:30.660]  It was the pilot. It was the beta test.
[2:55:30.660 --> 2:55:34.660]  And what they learned from the crack epidemic or the drug wave
[2:55:34.660 --> 2:55:37.660]  between late 60s and mid 80s,
[2:55:37.660 --> 2:55:41.660]  not only from a jurisprudence standpoint, but from a psychological standpoint,
[2:55:41.660 --> 2:55:44.660]  was the blueprint for big tech.
[2:55:44.660 --> 2:55:48.660]  They took the psychological data that they mined from watching behavior
[2:55:48.660 --> 2:55:51.660]  from drug addiction during the drug wave,
[2:55:51.660 --> 2:55:55.660]  and put it in the dopamine.
[2:55:55.660 --> 2:55:59.660]  When you're on social media, you're playing a slot machine at the casino.
[2:55:59.660 --> 2:56:01.660]  Slot machines, and they're open about it.
[2:56:01.660 --> 2:56:03.660]  They call the casino gulag.
[2:56:03.660 --> 2:56:06.660]  And they're basically saying, our drug is so good,
[2:56:06.660 --> 2:56:09.660]  we can tell you that it's going to kill you, and you'll still take it.
[2:56:09.660 --> 2:56:12.660]  I mean, the audacity of the grandiosity of the federal government
[2:56:12.660 --> 2:56:14.660]  and the elitists in America.
[2:56:14.660 --> 2:56:16.660]  Totally predatory.
[2:56:16.660 --> 2:56:19.660]  It doesn't matter whether you're black or white or whatever, it's going to eat you too.
[2:56:19.660 --> 2:56:23.660]  Absolutely. But black people do have to correct that history and stand up.
[2:56:23.660 --> 2:56:26.660]  No, no, absolutely. Don't be victims. Don't buy it. Exactly.
[2:56:26.660 --> 2:56:28.660]  You got to jump ship right now.
[2:56:28.660 --> 2:56:32.660]  Understand that when Joe Biden stood up there, he was a puppet
[2:56:32.660 --> 2:56:37.660]  for a much broader agenda that we have to deviate from in order to save this.
[2:56:37.660 --> 2:56:39.660]  What you're saying is key.
[2:56:39.660 --> 2:56:41.660]  People are victims, but don't buy into that victimhood.
[2:56:41.660 --> 2:56:46.660]  Transcend it, and don't buy into the leftist policies of the same group that did it.
[2:56:46.660 --> 2:56:50.660]  I mean, yeah, that's just insane. The same people who were predatory against you
[2:56:50.660 --> 2:56:55.660]  and manipulated you and created that chaos or that circumstance for chaos
[2:56:55.660 --> 2:56:58.660]  are the people who are now saying they want to save you.
[2:56:58.660 --> 2:57:01.660]  And now they're saying they're going to cut all our boys' dentitals off.
[2:57:01.660 --> 2:57:03.660]  I mean, these people are sick.
[2:57:03.660 --> 2:57:07.660]  Well, that's satanic to the max. That's just a stress test.
[2:57:07.660 --> 2:57:10.660]  They're just checking to see if people have any more...
[2:57:10.660 --> 2:57:11.660]  I agree....than God.
[2:57:11.660 --> 2:57:16.660]  100% a stress test on fire. Royce White's our guest. He's going to host the fourth hour
[2:57:16.660 --> 2:57:19.660]  ahead of Owen Schreuer in 60 minutes.
[2:57:19.660 --> 2:57:21.660]  We're going to aeritate. You're going to sit right here, brother,
[2:57:21.660 --> 2:57:23.660]  and take over and eat my lunch and watch it. I love you.
[2:57:23.660 --> 2:57:24.660]  Thanks for coming here, brother.
[2:57:24.660 --> 2:57:25.660]  Godspeed, brother.
[2:57:25.660 --> 2:57:26.660]  Love you. I want you to get in Congress regardless.
[2:57:26.660 --> 2:57:27.660]  Thank you.
[2:57:27.660 --> 2:57:28.660]  We appreciate you fighting.
[2:57:28.660 --> 2:57:29.660]  Thank you, brother.
[2:57:29.660 --> 2:57:30.660]  It's a badass American to pay for you right there.
[2:57:30.660 --> 2:57:32.660]  All right, we'll be right back.
[2:57:32.660 --> 2:57:36.660]  And again, I'm very blessed to be here in defiance of their evil and tyranny
[2:57:36.660 --> 2:57:38.660]  because God's watching.
[2:57:38.660 --> 2:57:41.660]  Our number four is two minutes away. Stay with us.
[2:58:08.660 --> 2:58:12.660]  Right now at 1776point.com.
[2:58:12.660 --> 2:58:16.660]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members for this big project
[2:58:16.660 --> 2:58:20.660]  we're launching in the near future, you'll also get a personal signed piece of art
[2:58:20.660 --> 2:58:24.660]  I made of the sheepdog chasing the wolf and a personal message.
[2:58:24.660 --> 2:58:31.660]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776point.com.
[2:58:31.660 --> 2:58:33.660]  This is history happening now.
[2:58:33.660 --> 2:58:40.660]  Info War Station support is changing the world and this is the final 75 three coin set
[2:58:40.660 --> 2:58:46.660]  exclusively available at 1776point.com.
[2:58:46.660 --> 2:58:51.660]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S.
[2:58:51.660 --> 2:58:56.660]  that supplies the highest quality signature reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon
[2:58:56.660 --> 2:58:58.660]  and other U.S. government agencies.
[2:58:58.660 --> 2:59:03.660]  And now they have produced specifically for us this made in America high end line
[2:59:03.660 --> 2:59:08.660]  at a very affordable price, whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone
[2:59:08.660 --> 2:59:14.660]  or big pouches that protect laptops and iPads or big bags that promote whatever electronics
[2:59:14.660 --> 2:59:17.660]  you want to put in it like desktop computers.
[2:59:17.660 --> 2:59:23.660]  It is all exclusively available at infowarstore.com under the Redux name.
[2:59:23.660 --> 2:59:28.660]  Redux is Info Wars taking the highest quality products and bringing them directly to you
[2:59:28.660 --> 2:59:30.660]  at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:30.660 --> 2:59:35.660]  In this insane world, you are crazy if you don't protect your signature, your identity
[2:59:35.660 --> 2:59:39.660]  from identity theft, hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.
[2:59:39.660 --> 3:00:02.660]  This is one of the hottest items out there today that's exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[3:00:02.660 --> 3:00:06.660]  This equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication.
[3:00:06.660 --> 3:00:10.660]  So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero.
[3:00:10.660 --> 3:00:17.660]  And that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person's using on average,
[3:00:17.660 --> 3:00:24.660]  the energy on average for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
[3:00:24.660 --> 3:00:29.660]  So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
[3:00:29.660 --> 3:00:33.660]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get prettier to zero.
[3:00:33.660 --> 3:00:37.660]  Now, that's back from a high school algebra, but let's look.
[3:00:37.660 --> 3:00:40.660]  First, we've got population.
[3:00:40.660 --> 3:00:43.660]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[3:00:43.660 --> 3:00:45.660]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[3:00:45.660 --> 3:00:52.660]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services,
[3:00:52.660 --> 3:00:55.660]  we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[3:00:55.660 --> 3:01:04.660]  Many believed that Bill Gates somehow misspoke when he attributed successful depopulation to the vaccines.
[3:01:04.660 --> 3:01:06.660]  But it's now evident that he didn't.
[3:01:06.660 --> 3:01:11.660]  He was being very clear about the intentions of the globalist agenda.
[3:01:11.660 --> 3:01:16.660]  Kill 99.99 percent of all humans.
[3:01:16.660 --> 3:01:21.660]  According to these psychopaths, this is how we will save the planet.
[3:01:21.660 --> 3:01:25.660]  And they have convinced an overwhelming amount of the world's population
[3:01:25.660 --> 3:01:29.660]  into accepting their agenda and pushing for it.
[3:01:29.660 --> 3:01:32.660]  People who believe that humans need to be aborted
[3:01:32.660 --> 3:01:37.660]  and believe the human race needs to be called into a small, compliant herd.
[3:01:37.660 --> 3:01:41.660]  People that are okay with billions of people starving
[3:01:41.660 --> 3:01:46.660]  so long as the screens on their devices tell them it's the right thing to do.
[3:01:46.660 --> 3:01:50.660]  But not everyone has gone insane.
[3:01:50.660 --> 3:01:53.660]  Some still have a survival instinct.
[3:01:53.660 --> 3:02:01.660]  When the Dutch government voted in a scheme that will force farmers to cut their livestock down to unsustainable levels,
[3:02:01.660 --> 3:02:08.660]  thereby forcing them out of work and shutting down the second biggest food exporter in the world,
[3:02:08.660 --> 3:02:12.660]  the farmers did the right thing and said no.
[3:02:12.660 --> 3:02:17.660]  And protests have broken out all throughout the Netherlands.
[3:02:17.660 --> 3:02:25.660]  Shutting down the world's second biggest food exporter is all part of the anti-human zero emissions plan.
[3:02:25.660 --> 3:02:30.660]  And so the Dutch farmers aren't just protesting losing their jobs.
[3:02:30.660 --> 3:02:35.660]  They're protesting the mass murder of the world's population.
[3:02:35.660 --> 3:02:39.660]  Just like the Canadian truckers and farmers did last winter,
[3:02:39.660 --> 3:02:46.660]  and just like the Canadian police sided with the tyrants, the Dutch cops are doing the same.
[3:02:46.660 --> 3:02:53.660]  Police drawing their sidearms on peaceful protesters and opening fire on them.
[3:02:53.660 --> 3:02:55.660]  Hey, weapons, guys, weapons!
[3:02:55.660 --> 3:02:58.660]  Hey, move away, guys, move away!
[3:02:58.660 --> 3:03:00.660]  Should we go with them?
[3:03:00.660 --> 3:03:19.660]  Using undercover agents and provoking violence to shut down peaceful gatherings.
[3:03:19.660 --> 3:03:23.660]  Because the globalists are not taking no for an answer.
[3:03:23.660 --> 3:03:32.660]  And while you may back the blue, chances are that they won't back you when it comes to the globalist agenda,
[3:03:32.660 --> 3:03:38.660]  which has now enlisted A-list celebrities to convince us all to eat bugs.
[3:03:38.660 --> 3:03:43.660]  I'm Nicole Kidman, and I am going to eat a four-cost meal of bugs.
[3:03:43.660 --> 3:03:50.660]  They're trying to persuade us into dying peacefully, like good, obedient slaves.
[3:03:50.660 --> 3:03:53.660]  But soon the food will start to run out.
[3:03:53.660 --> 3:03:58.660]  And worse, more signs of kinetic world war on the horizon,
[3:03:58.660 --> 3:04:04.660]  as Japan's longest standing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is assassinated.
[3:04:04.660 --> 3:04:09.660]  And former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev joins President Putin
[3:04:09.660 --> 3:04:15.660]  in threatening nuclear annihilation if the United States continues their provocations.
[3:04:15.660 --> 3:04:19.660]  Which is exactly what the Extinction Rebellion wants.
[3:04:19.660 --> 3:04:22.660]  And it's what the Biden administration wants.
[3:04:22.660 --> 3:04:25.660]  It's what everyone in charge wants.
[3:04:25.660 --> 3:04:29.660]  The only way out of this is a worldwide people's revolution.
[3:04:29.660 --> 3:04:35.660]  The Dutch farmers have begun, and they have been joined by people from other nations.
[3:04:35.660 --> 3:04:38.660]  The revolution will not be televised.
[3:04:38.660 --> 3:04:46.660]  And if you want to stand up against evil, then now is the time, while you are still alive.
[3:04:46.660 --> 3:04:49.660]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[3:04:57.660 --> 3:05:03.660]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all.
[3:05:03.660 --> 3:05:07.660]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[3:05:07.660 --> 3:05:12.660]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare.
[3:05:12.660 --> 3:05:15.660]  And that alone is something to be grateful for.
[3:05:15.660 --> 3:05:19.660]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water,
[3:05:19.660 --> 3:05:23.660]  even in the event of your taps getting shut off.
[3:05:23.660 --> 3:05:28.660]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[3:05:28.660 --> 3:05:32.660]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family,
[3:05:32.660 --> 3:05:35.660]  you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[3:05:35.660 --> 3:05:40.660]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming,
[3:05:40.660 --> 3:05:46.660]  but you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[3:05:46.660 --> 3:05:51.660]  Whoever sews bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[3:05:51.660 --> 3:06:19.660]  Stock up now at PrepareToday.com.
[3:06:21.660 --> 3:06:26.660]  We're going to talk about a lot of things this hour.
[3:06:26.660 --> 3:06:32.660]  Sacred Honor, National Honor, America's Future.
[3:06:32.660 --> 3:06:40.660]  But first, I wanted to show a video of Gaddafi's UN speech to give the framework.
[3:06:40.660 --> 3:06:45.660]  I thought Gaddafi in 2009 laid out an incredible framework for globalism.
[3:06:45.660 --> 3:06:49.660]  Kind of a cheat sheet, a crash course for somebody who may not be initiated
[3:06:49.660 --> 3:06:51.660]  and please share this with others.
[3:06:51.660 --> 3:06:55.660]  This is not an endorsement of Gaddafi wholesale as a leader,
[3:06:55.660 --> 3:07:00.660]  as a president, prime minister of Libya.
[3:07:00.660 --> 3:07:05.660]  However, obviously Libya has seen its fair share of turmoil
[3:07:05.660 --> 3:07:08.660]  since Gaddafi was assassinated by the globalists.
[3:07:08.660 --> 3:07:10.660]  But cue the tape up for me if you can.
[3:07:10.660 --> 3:07:12.660]  I want people to start this.
[3:07:12.660 --> 3:07:16.660]  I want to start the segment off with this speech.
[3:07:16.660 --> 3:07:21.660]  As is known, the United Nations was founded by three or four countries
[3:07:21.660 --> 3:07:26.660]  against Germany at the time.
[3:07:26.660 --> 3:07:36.660]  The United Nations was formed by the nations that...
[3:07:36.660 --> 3:07:47.660]  Yeah, no problem. Yeah, we'll get it up, guys.
[3:07:47.660 --> 3:07:51.660]  You can go to the post. There's an actual post that will play the full 12 minutes.
[3:07:51.660 --> 3:07:53.660]  That's from the story.
[3:07:53.660 --> 3:07:58.660]  Gaddafi lays out, in short, the inception of the United Nations.
[3:07:58.660 --> 3:08:08.660]  And this entire New World Order was brought about or expedited post World War II.
[3:08:08.660 --> 3:08:13.660]  And that is not a justification of Adolf Hitler and the atrocities
[3:08:13.660 --> 3:08:17.660]  that he waged against the Jewish people, but much of Europe
[3:08:17.660 --> 3:08:19.660]  and planned to the rest of the world.
[3:08:19.660 --> 3:08:23.660]  It is to show and highlight how the enemy we face
[3:08:23.660 --> 3:08:34.660]  uses or never misses the chance to use a crisis to their advantage.
[3:08:34.660 --> 3:08:41.660]  And what we did, many people believe that we won World War II.
[3:08:41.660 --> 3:08:44.660]  Let's say that. We didn't win World War II.
[3:08:44.660 --> 3:08:49.660]  We lost World War II. Many people lost their faith after World War II.
[3:08:49.660 --> 3:08:54.660]  And that might have been the biggest win for Satan in the last 100 years.
[3:08:54.660 --> 3:08:58.660]  After that, we opened up China, Nixon in the 70s, Roe v. Wade.
[3:08:58.660 --> 3:09:03.660]  We went off the gold standard and the NWO was in full force.
[3:09:03.660 --> 3:09:12.660]  All of it, the UN, NATO, NWO uses Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany
[3:09:12.660 --> 3:09:17.660]  as a justification to consolidate power and global governance.
[3:09:17.660 --> 3:09:22.660]  And what Gaddafi explains in the video that we now have queued up for you is
[3:09:22.660 --> 3:09:28.660]  how the veto power works of the permanent seats of the United States Security Council
[3:09:28.660 --> 3:09:33.660]  and how those four countries that granted themselves permanent seats,
[3:09:33.660 --> 3:09:36.660]  first of all, were never in alignment with the original preamble,
[3:09:36.660 --> 3:09:40.660]  which stated that all countries were equal, and what has happened.
[3:09:40.660 --> 3:09:47.660]  Now, those four Security Council nations had the opportunity to be genuine
[3:09:47.660 --> 3:09:50.660]  and honorable and humane in their power.
[3:09:50.660 --> 3:09:55.660]  But as we so often do as men, we abuse our power.
[3:09:55.660 --> 3:10:01.660]  And what has resulted is more wars or 60-plus wars of aggression
[3:10:01.660 --> 3:10:05.660]  that the United States Security Council has waged. So let's see the clip.
[3:10:05.660 --> 3:10:12.660]  As is known, the United Nations was founded by three or four countries
[3:10:12.660 --> 3:10:18.660]  against Germany at the time.
[3:10:18.660 --> 3:10:24.660]  The United Nations was formed by the nations that joined together against Germany
[3:10:24.660 --> 3:10:30.660]  in the Second World War.
[3:10:30.660 --> 3:10:35.660]  Those countries formed the body called the Security Council,
[3:10:35.660 --> 3:10:44.660]  made its own countries permanent members and granted them the power of veto.
[3:10:44.660 --> 3:10:49.660]  We were not present at that time.
[3:10:49.660 --> 3:10:53.660]  The United Nations was shaped in line with those three countries
[3:10:53.660 --> 3:11:00.660]  and wanted us to step into the shoes originally designed against Germany.
[3:11:00.660 --> 3:11:07.660]  That is the real substance of the United Nations when it was founded over 60 years ago.
[3:11:07.660 --> 3:11:22.660]  That happened in the absence of some 165 countries at a ratio of one to eight.
[3:11:22.660 --> 3:11:26.660]  That is, one was present and eight were absent.
[3:11:26.660 --> 3:11:34.660]  They created the charter of which I have a copy.
[3:11:34.660 --> 3:11:40.660]  If one reads the charter of the United Nations, one finds that the preamble of the charter
[3:11:40.660 --> 3:11:43.660]  differs from its articles.
[3:11:43.660 --> 3:11:49.660]  How did it come into existence?
[3:11:49.660 --> 3:11:53.660]  All those who attended the San Francisco Conference in 1945
[3:11:53.660 --> 3:11:58.660]  participated in creating the preamble, but they left the articles and internal rules
[3:11:58.660 --> 3:12:05.660]  of the procedures of the so-called Security Council to experts, specialists and interested countries,
[3:12:05.660 --> 3:12:09.660]  which were those countries that had established the Security Council
[3:12:09.660 --> 3:12:11.660]  and united against Germany.
[3:12:11.660 --> 3:12:14.660]  The preamble is very appealing and no one objects to it,
[3:12:14.660 --> 3:12:18.660]  but all the provisions that follow it completely contradict the preamble.
[3:12:18.660 --> 3:12:21.660]  We expect such provisions that we will never uphold them.
[3:12:21.660 --> 3:12:43.660]  They ended with the Second World War.
[3:12:43.660 --> 3:12:57.660]  The preamble says that all nations, small or large, are equal.
[3:12:57.660 --> 3:13:00.660]  Are we equal when it comes to the permanent seats?
[3:13:00.660 --> 3:13:04.660]  No, we're not equal.
[3:13:04.660 --> 3:13:10.660]  The preamble states in writing that all nations are equal whether they are small or large.
[3:13:10.660 --> 3:13:13.660]  Do we have the right of veto?
[3:13:13.660 --> 3:13:16.660]  Are we equal?
[3:13:16.660 --> 3:13:20.660]  The preamble says that we have equal rights whether we are large or small.
[3:13:20.660 --> 3:13:23.660]  Okay, stop it right there.
[3:13:23.660 --> 3:13:26.660]  We're going to come back to this video throughout the hour.
[3:13:26.660 --> 3:13:31.660]  I want people to see it's about 12 minutes, 10 minutes of video here.
[3:13:31.660 --> 3:13:34.660]  But even so far, this laid the groundwork for globalism.
[3:13:34.660 --> 3:13:36.660]  This is what we face.
[3:13:36.660 --> 3:13:39.660]  We face the consolidation of power.
[3:13:39.660 --> 3:13:44.660]  We face a scope of governance that is way beyond the humility
[3:13:44.660 --> 3:13:47.660]  that was envisioned by our founding fathers here in America
[3:13:47.660 --> 3:13:52.660]  for your everyday average American citizenship, a citizen.
[3:13:52.660 --> 3:13:56.660]  And we are losing our citizenship in a rapid way.
[3:13:56.660 --> 3:14:03.660]  And we have to find a way to look within ourselves, look in the mirror.
[3:14:03.660 --> 3:14:06.660]  Each and every one of us at home, look in the mirror and ask ourselves
[3:14:06.660 --> 3:14:08.660]  what we've traded for that freedom.
[3:14:08.660 --> 3:14:11.660]  The idea of American freedom, the concept of American freedom,
[3:14:11.660 --> 3:14:15.660]  a nation of shopkeepers with the Second Amendment, what does that do?
[3:14:15.660 --> 3:14:22.660]  It creates a safeguard and a bastion of freedom against economic imperialism and tyranny.
[3:14:22.660 --> 3:14:24.660]  And we've given that up.
[3:14:24.660 --> 3:14:27.660]  And many of these cultural narratives or these political narratives
[3:14:27.660 --> 3:14:32.660]  that wage and wane in different directions have us arguing about things
[3:14:32.660 --> 3:14:37.660]  that take away from us the fundamental position we need to protect our citizenship.
[3:14:37.660 --> 3:14:50.660]  And it boils down to two main, two main, two main vices, security and materialism.
[3:14:50.660 --> 3:14:54.660]  On the right, we've surrendered our freedom for security.
[3:14:54.660 --> 3:14:56.660]  We believe in the rule of law.
[3:14:56.660 --> 3:15:01.660]  We have a naive belief in the rule of law.
[3:15:01.660 --> 3:15:03.660]  On the left, it's radical materialism,
[3:15:03.660 --> 3:15:07.660]  whether it's the pursuit of materialism or material things,
[3:15:07.660 --> 3:15:13.660]  or it's the lack thereof and then nihilism as a result of a lack of material things.
[3:15:13.660 --> 3:15:21.660]  These are the two guiding pillars of our loss of faith.
[3:15:21.660 --> 3:15:25.660]  And in our loss of faith, we have a loss of freedom.
[3:15:25.660 --> 3:15:28.660]  You can't have freedom without self-governance,
[3:15:28.660 --> 3:15:32.660]  but you can't have self-governance without sacred honor and faith.
[3:15:32.660 --> 3:15:37.660]  And we're going to be talking about that throughout this entire hour
[3:15:37.660 --> 3:15:40.660]  as it pertains to a number of stories.
[3:15:40.660 --> 3:15:43.660]  I'm very thankful to be here again for the hour.
[3:15:43.660 --> 3:15:47.660]  Thank you to Alex Jones and the UFO Wars team for allowing me to host.
[3:15:47.660 --> 3:15:50.660]  We're going to come back with a little bit more from the Gaddafi clip.
[3:15:50.660 --> 3:15:52.660]  Next.
[3:15:56.660 --> 3:16:00.660]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[3:16:00.660 --> 3:16:03.660]  I've been training, probably not as much as I should be,
[3:16:03.660 --> 3:16:07.660]  but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com.
[3:16:07.660 --> 3:16:11.660]  Before I start out on a run, I throw down some turbo force
[3:16:11.660 --> 3:16:13.660]  to give me that energy I need to get going.
[3:16:13.660 --> 3:16:16.660]  You know, besides the energy, turbo force,
[3:16:16.660 --> 3:16:20.660]  it is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C to keep me healthy
[3:16:20.660 --> 3:16:24.660]  and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained energy,
[3:16:24.660 --> 3:16:27.660]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[3:16:27.660 --> 3:16:30.660]  And every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones' Soros.
[3:16:30.660 --> 3:16:33.660]  I have bad joints. Thanks, mom.
[3:16:33.660 --> 3:16:36.660]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now,
[3:16:36.660 --> 3:16:40.660]  plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[3:16:40.660 --> 3:16:44.660]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[3:16:44.660 --> 3:16:47.660]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon,
[3:16:47.660 --> 3:16:51.660]  good news, turbo force, that can still give you the energy and clarity you need
[3:16:51.660 --> 3:16:55.660]  for every day and Soros can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[3:16:55.660 --> 3:17:01.660]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[3:17:01.660 --> 3:17:05.660]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[3:17:05.660 --> 3:17:09.660]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[3:17:09.660 --> 3:17:12.660]  You might not agree with everything. You might not agree with all our perspectives,
[3:17:12.660 --> 3:17:14.660]  but we cover all the information.
[3:17:14.660 --> 3:17:17.660]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[3:17:17.660 --> 3:17:20.660]  Thank you for that, Ward. Infowarsstore.com, by the way,
[3:17:20.660 --> 3:17:23.660]  the products he mentions, Infowarsstore.com is where to get them, folks.
[3:17:23.660 --> 3:17:25.660]  And we do have the best supplements.
[3:17:25.660 --> 3:17:30.660]  I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information,
[3:17:30.660 --> 3:17:34.660]  we do the best with our supplements as well.
[3:17:34.660 --> 3:17:36.660]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[3:17:36.660 --> 3:17:39.660]  Folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[3:17:39.660 --> 3:17:42.660]  It's 75% off. By the way, it works for me.
[3:17:42.660 --> 3:17:47.660]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[3:17:47.660 --> 3:17:49.660]  Quite well, I might add.
[3:17:49.660 --> 3:17:53.660]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[3:17:53.660 --> 3:17:55.660]  I go and see him quite often now.
[3:18:00.660 --> 3:18:02.660]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[3:18:02.660 --> 3:18:04.660]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing. It is.
[3:18:04.660 --> 3:18:09.660]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[3:18:09.660 --> 3:18:12.660]  The fish oil is better than that. And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[3:18:12.660 --> 3:18:18.660]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[3:18:18.660 --> 3:18:21.660]  Crill oil is the best. And it'll give you the damn burps.
[3:18:21.660 --> 3:18:24.660]  And I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[3:18:24.660 --> 3:18:26.660]  The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good.
[3:18:26.660 --> 3:18:29.660]  In my view, I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[3:18:29.660 --> 3:18:32.660]  I eat five caplets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[3:18:32.660 --> 3:18:34.660]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[3:18:35.660 --> 3:18:40.660]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[3:18:43.660 --> 3:18:46.660]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess,
[3:18:46.660 --> 3:18:49.660]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[3:18:49.660 --> 3:18:50.660]  I just can't do it.
[3:18:55.660 --> 3:19:01.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, high quality, storeable food is back in stock, ready to ship right now.
[3:19:01.660 --> 3:19:05.660]  We've not been selling food for three months because it was taking several weeks
[3:19:05.660 --> 3:19:07.660]  for the food to get packaged and delivered to you.
[3:19:07.660 --> 3:19:09.660]  Most of their companies are completely out.
[3:19:09.660 --> 3:19:14.660]  But now they have a large spectrum of high quality food ready to ship.
[3:19:14.660 --> 3:19:20.660]  Everything you find at PrepareWithAlex.com or PrepareToDay.com is in stock, ready to ship.
[3:19:20.660 --> 3:19:23.660]  So go to PrepareWithAlex.com or PrepareToDay.com
[3:19:23.660 --> 3:19:27.660]  and order your high quality, storeable food right now, ready to ship to you and your family.
[3:19:27.660 --> 3:19:31.660]  With the inflation happening, with the food shortages, with the wars, with the collapsing wars,
[3:19:31.660 --> 3:19:34.660]  everything's happening is one of the most important things you can make
[3:19:34.660 --> 3:19:38.660]  is to have high quality, storeable food, water filtration, air filtration and more.
[3:19:38.660 --> 3:19:41.660]  And it's not just those items, it's hundreds of other high quality,
[3:19:41.660 --> 3:19:45.660]  prepared in this items and survival items right now at PrepareWithAlex.com
[3:19:45.660 --> 3:19:49.660]  that again redirects to PrepareToday.com.
[3:19:49.660 --> 3:19:51.660]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:19:51.660 --> 3:19:54.660]  One of the most important things you can do is get ahead of inflation now
[3:19:54.660 --> 3:19:56.660]  because the inflation is just beginning.
[3:20:07.660 --> 3:20:10.660]  Are we equal when it comes to the permanent seats?
[3:20:10.660 --> 3:20:13.660]  No, we're not equal.
[3:20:13.660 --> 3:20:20.660]  The preamble states in writing that all nations are equal whether they are small or large.
[3:20:20.660 --> 3:20:25.660]  Do we have the right of veto? Are we equal?
[3:20:25.660 --> 3:20:32.660]  The preamble says that we have equal rights whether we are large or small.
[3:20:32.660 --> 3:20:36.660]  That is what is stated and what we agreed in the preamble.
[3:20:36.660 --> 3:20:41.660]  So the veto contradicts the charter.
[3:20:41.660 --> 3:20:44.660]  The permanent seats contradict the charter.
[3:20:44.660 --> 3:20:48.660]  We neither accept nor recognize the veto.
[3:20:58.660 --> 3:21:05.660]  The preamble of the charter states that armed force shall not be used save in the common interests.
[3:21:05.660 --> 3:21:08.660]  That is the preamble that we agreed to and signed
[3:21:08.660 --> 3:21:13.660]  and we joined the United Nations because we wanted the charter to reflect that.
[3:21:17.660 --> 3:21:22.660]  It says that armed force shall then be used in the common interests of all nations.
[3:21:22.660 --> 3:21:24.660]  But what has happened since then?
[3:21:24.660 --> 3:21:30.660]  65 wars have broken out since the establishment of the United Nations and Security Council.
[3:21:30.660 --> 3:21:35.660]  65 is their creation with the millions more victims in the Second World War.
[3:21:35.660 --> 3:21:43.660]  Are those wars and the aggression and force that we use in those 65 wars in the common interests of us all?
[3:21:43.660 --> 3:21:50.660]  No. They were in the interest of one or three or four countries, but not of all nations.
[3:21:50.660 --> 3:21:54.660]  Stop it there. I mean, you've got to love this.
[3:21:54.660 --> 3:22:01.660]  You know, regardless of how you feel about Moe Markadofi and all of the things that were said about him in his life and the things that he did in Libya,
[3:22:01.660 --> 3:22:09.660]  you've got to love a man standing up before the entire United Nations summit in the heart of a very controversial time
[3:22:09.660 --> 3:22:11.660]  and just calling all of them out.
[3:22:11.660 --> 3:22:16.660]  And you can see as they pan the camera to the crowd of the different nations that are watching, people are just panicking.
[3:22:16.660 --> 3:22:23.660]  I mean, I don't know if you guys can see that or feel that, but when I watch it, I can see that the nations who are implicated are just panicking.
[3:22:23.660 --> 3:22:27.660]  And, you know, this was the framework for globalism.
[3:22:27.660 --> 3:22:29.660]  This was the framework for the globalism we face.
[3:22:29.660 --> 3:22:40.660]  And what he's laying out is how the structure of the United Nations has been used to wage war on the free people of the world.
[3:22:40.660 --> 3:22:42.660]  And that is what has happened.
[3:22:42.660 --> 3:22:52.660]  And American citizens are first to blame because the United Nations is a running dog for America's security state.
[3:22:52.660 --> 3:22:54.660]  Or the security state of the West or the globalists.
[3:22:54.660 --> 3:22:57.660]  It's one big cabal.
[3:22:57.660 --> 3:22:58.660]  It's one big group.
[3:22:58.660 --> 3:23:03.660]  And many people would say that I'm in danger for even saying that, as Gaddafi surely was.
[3:23:03.660 --> 3:23:09.660]  He was killed or assassinated 16 months after this speech.
[3:23:09.660 --> 3:23:15.660]  But to go back and circle to America, American freedom, the idea of it.
[3:23:15.660 --> 3:23:21.660]  The nation of shopkeepers and the Second Amendment as a bastion against economic imperialism and tyranny.
[3:23:21.660 --> 3:23:23.660]  We've given that up.
[3:23:23.660 --> 3:23:34.660]  And our security state, our military industrial complex, the three states that are our biggest enemy.
[3:23:34.660 --> 3:23:44.660]  Like I said before, the administrative state, the security state, the deep state, we have given up the idea of American freedom for security.
[3:23:44.660 --> 3:24:02.660]  And we've allowed our military industrial complex to use American freedom, America's fundamental foundational values as a, as a prerequisite to wage unholy wars around the world.
[3:24:02.660 --> 3:24:04.660]  So we are culpable.
[3:24:04.660 --> 3:24:17.660]  We are to blame and not just the military industrial complex that has gotten out of control and went in pirated resources or whatever national interest they say around the world.
[3:24:17.660 --> 3:24:28.660]  We, the American people allowed it because we've been cowards, because we believe it's the government's duty to ensure our freedom and our security.
[3:24:28.660 --> 3:24:34.660]  But it was never for the American government to ensure the security and freedom of American citizens.
[3:24:34.660 --> 3:24:35.660]  It's for us to do.
[3:24:35.660 --> 3:24:43.660]  And every time we give up, we give up our own, our own responsibility in ensuring our freedom.
[3:24:43.660 --> 3:24:55.660]  We lend a hand for the globalists and our securities to our own agencies here domestically to tarnish America, the brand of America, and even more importantly, the spirit of America.
[3:24:55.660 --> 3:25:02.660]  And that's what's happened. And that's what Gaddafi is explaining in this, in this, in this speech that he gave.
[3:25:02.660 --> 3:25:04.660]  And we're not alone.
[3:25:04.660 --> 3:25:09.660]  But what we have to understand is we are the safeguard for freedom for the entire world.
[3:25:09.660 --> 3:25:10.660]  It's a heavy duty.
[3:25:10.660 --> 3:25:12.660]  I know it's a heavy crown to wear.
[3:25:12.660 --> 3:25:16.660]  It's a, it's a heavy cross to bear, but it is the truth.
[3:25:16.660 --> 3:25:22.660]  America is a unique country in this, in this world's history.
[3:25:22.660 --> 3:25:36.660]  The, the ideas that we were founded upon are unique to human civilization and, and with them carry a touch of divinity, the, the, the signature of divinity.
[3:25:36.660 --> 3:25:38.660]  And we've gotten away from that as well.
[3:25:38.660 --> 3:25:45.660]  And we have to go back to both in order to restore this country and to hopefully move the world in the right direction.
[3:25:45.660 --> 3:25:56.660]  If America falls, which is the goal of the United Nations, and it was the goal of the United Nations when Gaddafi said it, but it was also the goal, possibly in its inception.
[3:25:56.660 --> 3:25:59.660]  If America falls, the globalists will have their way.
[3:25:59.660 --> 3:26:13.660]  And that's why many of our elected officials and their policies and their, and their ideas and their, and their language sounds so contradictory to the interest of American citizens,
[3:26:13.660 --> 3:26:15.660]  because they're not interested in Americans.
[3:26:15.660 --> 3:26:17.660]  They're not interested in America.
[3:26:17.660 --> 3:26:20.660]  They're not interested in the idea of freedom.
[3:26:20.660 --> 3:26:23.660]  They're not interested in the idea of citizenship.
[3:26:23.660 --> 3:26:25.660]  They don't want us to have a country.
[3:26:25.660 --> 3:26:32.660]  That's what Gaddafi's explaining is that the United Nations was the predicate to have a borderless one world government.
[3:26:32.660 --> 3:26:34.660]  And that's how the United Nations is operated.
[3:26:34.660 --> 3:26:38.660]  And the security state has been, has been there every step of the way.
[3:26:38.660 --> 3:26:39.660]  Lockstep.
[3:26:39.660 --> 3:26:41.660]  We have to take these two.
[3:26:41.660 --> 3:26:47.660]  Look, when President Trump wins in 2024, he needs to clean out this.
[3:26:47.660 --> 3:26:52.660]  Every, every intelligence community head should be fired.
[3:26:52.660 --> 3:26:56.660]  The entire intelligence community needs to be cleaned out.
[3:26:56.660 --> 3:26:57.660]  Okay.
[3:26:57.660 --> 3:27:01.660]  The intelligence community is the biggest enemy of this country.
[3:27:01.660 --> 3:27:10.660]  And for me as a 30 year old man to sit here on Alex Jones' show and say that carries a significant danger and threat to it.
[3:27:10.660 --> 3:27:12.660]  And we all know it, who are watching this.
[3:27:12.660 --> 3:27:20.660]  Yet, we would put up with a president taking a bullet right there in Dealey Plaza.
[3:27:20.660 --> 3:27:22.660]  We tolerated that.
[3:27:22.660 --> 3:27:23.660]  We accepted that.
[3:27:23.660 --> 3:27:24.660]  The magic bullet did.
[3:27:24.660 --> 3:27:26.660]  We accepted the magic bullet theory.
[3:27:26.660 --> 3:27:28.660]  It's ridiculous.
[3:27:28.660 --> 3:27:29.660]  It's ridiculous.
[3:27:29.660 --> 3:27:33.660]  We accepted that Robert Kennedy was, was killed by Sirhan Sirhan.
[3:27:33.660 --> 3:27:35.660]  The name Sirhan Sirhan is ridiculous.
[3:27:35.660 --> 3:27:39.660]  That's a, that's a security state asset name if I've ever heard one.
[3:27:39.660 --> 3:27:40.660]  We accepted these lies.
[3:27:40.660 --> 3:27:41.660]  Why?
[3:27:41.660 --> 3:27:46.660]  Because they were, they were greatly crafted because they were well woven lies because
[3:27:46.660 --> 3:27:50.660]  they, they had, they had a level of brilliance to them.
[3:27:50.660 --> 3:27:55.660]  No, we accepted them because it was easier to accept these lies than it was to confront
[3:27:55.660 --> 3:28:00.660]  the fact that we had given over our freedom for the security that a corrupt establishment
[3:28:00.660 --> 3:28:01.660]  provides us.
[3:28:01.660 --> 3:28:02.660]  We wanted to get high.
[3:28:02.660 --> 3:28:04.660]  We wanted to jerk off.
[3:28:04.660 --> 3:28:06.660]  We wanted to become famous and rich.
[3:28:06.660 --> 3:28:12.660]  We wanted to, you know, we wanted to, we wanted to be God.
[3:28:12.660 --> 3:28:14.660]  We wanted to be God.
[3:28:14.660 --> 3:28:21.660]  And since we have let Satan take the reins, I'm going to hold over into the next segment.
[3:28:21.660 --> 3:28:26.660]  That was a, that was a rant I didn't plan on, but the spirits in me.
[3:28:26.660 --> 3:28:30.660]  I want to say thank you again to Alex Jones for allowing me to host and to speak to this
[3:28:30.660 --> 3:28:31.660]  audience.
[3:28:31.660 --> 3:28:34.660]  It is the most spiritually alive audience in the world.
[3:28:34.660 --> 3:28:38.100]  I'm proud to be here in the cockpit of American truth.
[3:28:38.100 --> 3:28:39.300]  Stay with us to the next segment.
[3:28:39.300 --> 3:28:43.060]  I want to touch back on the Gaddafi's UN speech.
[3:28:43.060 --> 3:28:57.060]  Thank you.
[3:28:57.060 --> 3:29:02.100]  We brought the game changing product previously only available to major oil companies around
[3:29:02.100 --> 3:29:07.900]  the world to the civilian market two years ago, the bio pros for septic tanks, for port-a-potties,

[3:33:15.500 --> 3:33:22.740]  We will talk about whether those wars were in the interest of one country or of all nations
[3:33:22.740 --> 3:33:27.220]  that flagrantly contradicts the Charter of the United Nations that we signed and unless
[3:33:27.220 --> 3:33:31.380]  we act in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to which we all agreed, we
[3:33:31.380 --> 3:33:40.980]  will reject it and not be afraid not to speak diplomatically to anyone.
[3:33:40.980 --> 3:33:47.900]  Now we are talking about the future of the United Nations.
[3:33:47.900 --> 3:33:58.340]  There should be no hypocrisy or diplomacy because it concerns the important and vital
[3:33:58.340 --> 3:34:01.220]  issue of the future of the world.
[3:34:01.220 --> 3:34:20.060]  It was hypocrisy that brought about 65 wars since the establishment of the United Nations.
[3:34:20.060 --> 3:34:32.940]  The preamble also states that if armed force is used, it must be a United Nations force,
[3:34:32.940 --> 3:34:39.300]  thus military intervention by the United Nations with the joint agreement of the United Nations,
[3:34:39.300 --> 3:34:45.620]  not one or two or three countries using armed force.
[3:34:45.620 --> 3:34:53.420]  The entire United Nations will decide to go to war to maintain international peace and
[3:34:53.420 --> 3:34:56.180]  security.
[3:34:56.180 --> 3:35:01.360]  Since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945, if there is an act of aggression
[3:35:01.360 --> 3:35:17.060]  by one country against another, the entire United Nations should deter and stop that
[3:35:17.060 --> 3:35:18.620]  act.
[3:35:18.620 --> 3:35:27.540]  If a country, Libya for instance, were to exhibit aggression against France, then the
[3:35:27.540 --> 3:35:32.640]  entire organization would respond because France is a sovereign state, member of the
[3:35:32.640 --> 3:35:40.080]  United Nations, and we all share the collective responsibility to protect the sovereignty
[3:35:40.080 --> 3:35:44.720]  of all nations.
[3:35:44.720 --> 3:35:49.560]  However 65 aggressive wars have taken place without any United Nations action to prevent
[3:35:49.560 --> 3:35:55.760]  them.
[3:35:55.760 --> 3:36:01.040]  Eight other massive fierce wars whose victims, number some two million, have been waged by
[3:36:01.040 --> 3:36:06.800]  member states that enjoy veto powers.
[3:36:06.800 --> 3:36:10.920]  Those countries would have us believe they seek to maintain the sovereignty and independence
[3:36:10.920 --> 3:36:17.280]  of peoples, and to use aggressive force against peoples.
[3:36:17.280 --> 3:36:20.440]  Stop it there.
[3:36:20.440 --> 3:36:21.440]  Incredible.
[3:36:21.440 --> 3:36:22.440]  Incredible.
[3:36:22.440 --> 3:36:26.160]  Let me read you the permanent members of the Security Council right here.
[3:36:26.160 --> 3:36:27.440]  I got it brought up.
[3:36:27.440 --> 3:36:31.520]  We got China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
[3:36:31.520 --> 3:36:37.920]  China was the only country, not coincidentally, that was democratically voted to become a
[3:36:37.920 --> 3:36:42.440]  permanent member of the Security Council.
[3:36:42.440 --> 3:36:47.200]  What Gaddafi is laying out is what we face here in America as a nation.
[3:36:47.200 --> 3:36:57.280]  It's just on a smaller scale but correlated to the global as well.
[3:36:57.280 --> 3:37:03.440]  The surrendering of freedom in the name of a security of a war that has not yet come.
[3:37:03.440 --> 3:37:09.280]  We do it every single day and I see many of the issues that we discuss lacking any real
[3:37:09.280 --> 3:37:16.000]  concept of sovereignty or the importance of sovereignty, the importance of a nation state,
[3:37:16.000 --> 3:37:22.080]  the importance of self-governance.
[3:37:22.080 --> 3:37:24.400]  There is a price for freedom.
[3:37:24.400 --> 3:37:26.400]  The price of freedom is death.
[3:37:26.400 --> 3:37:28.400]  Thomas Jefferson said it.
[3:37:28.400 --> 3:37:30.440]  Malcolm X said it.
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:34.440]  And it's not to say that once you die, you become free.
[3:37:34.440 --> 3:37:38.480]  That's one way you can look at it, which is also true, I would say.
[3:37:38.480 --> 3:37:44.040]  But it's to say that in order to have true freedom, you must confront the possibility
[3:37:44.040 --> 3:37:48.040]  of death in pursuit or securing that freedom.
[3:37:48.040 --> 3:37:53.960]  And many of us don't want to have to confront the possibility, the immediate possibility
[3:37:53.960 --> 3:38:00.400]  or danger or threat of death in the pursuit or securing of our freedom.
[3:38:00.400 --> 3:38:06.400]  And that's how these corrupt institutions and people have taken the idea of freedom,
[3:38:06.400 --> 3:38:12.120]  democracy, all of these ideas and used them as propaganda to wage war and create a global
[3:38:12.120 --> 3:38:13.120]  governance.
[3:38:13.120 --> 3:38:19.040]  Now, I mean, this segues perfectly into the conflict that we have going on with Russia
[3:38:19.040 --> 3:38:20.040]  and the Ukraine.
[3:38:20.040 --> 3:38:25.520]  Because you've got Russia sitting here on the Security Council for many, many years
[3:38:25.520 --> 3:38:29.640]  and they're going, well, wait a second, if the Security Council is not going to play
[3:38:29.640 --> 3:38:39.040]  by the rules, if the Security Council is going to be undermined by NATO and we're going to
[3:38:39.040 --> 3:38:44.600]  play a a la carte game with the charter or the preamble, then the hell with the the hell
[3:38:44.600 --> 3:38:46.840]  with the Security Council altogether.
[3:38:46.840 --> 3:38:52.400]  So now we have a proxy war, a three way proxy war between the West, France, the United Kingdom
[3:38:52.400 --> 3:38:55.040]  and the United States, China and Russia.
[3:38:55.040 --> 3:38:58.200]  So the United Nations has become a nothing body.
[3:38:58.200 --> 3:39:03.600]  And these are the fundamental issues that American citizens have to start to look at
[3:39:03.600 --> 3:39:10.440]  and use to inform their decisions about their own individual lives and freedom, but also
[3:39:10.440 --> 3:39:15.160]  who we vote for and how we hold those people accountable.
[3:39:15.160 --> 3:39:21.800]  Because if the United Nations has become a nothing body, not adhering to the preamble
[3:39:21.800 --> 3:39:26.440]  or the charter, or that the countries in the Security Council are actually in a proxy war,
[3:39:26.440 --> 3:39:31.680]  which they are, then that means the World Health Organization has become a nothing body,
[3:39:31.680 --> 3:39:38.360]  which we already know, but I mean factually, on paper, the World Health Organization is
[3:39:38.360 --> 3:39:43.360]  illegitimate as it stands because its parent organization, the United Nations is illegitimate
[3:39:43.360 --> 3:39:46.040]  as it now operates.
[3:39:46.040 --> 3:39:48.120]  This is significant.
[3:39:48.120 --> 3:39:49.120]  This is significant.
[3:39:49.120 --> 3:39:53.600]  And that's why when I went back and watched this this UN speech from Gaddafi a few days
[3:39:53.600 --> 3:40:00.120]  back, I was I was in awe because it dawned on me that all of these global global governing
[3:40:00.120 --> 3:40:07.480]  institutions openly speak as though they have supreme authority over the world.
[3:40:07.480 --> 3:40:10.600]  When in actuality, they have no legitimate authority.
[3:40:10.600 --> 3:40:14.120]  They certainly don't have any divine authority, but they don't even have the authority that
[3:40:14.120 --> 3:40:21.120]  they laid out for themselves on paper, which shows you how incompetent they really are.
[3:40:21.120 --> 3:40:24.120]  Russia is not going to play by the rules of the United Nations.
[3:40:24.120 --> 3:40:27.120]  China is not going to play by the rules of the United Nations.
[3:40:27.120 --> 3:40:34.120]  And these other non permanent members that are on the Security Council, Albania, Brazil,
[3:40:34.120 --> 3:40:41.280]  Ghana, India, India is one of our nationalist allies there there in the Southeast Asia,
[3:40:41.280 --> 3:40:48.200]  but Mexico, Kenya, the United Arab Emirates, I mean the non issues and that's what Gaddafi
[3:40:48.200 --> 3:40:53.040]  is saying is they don't even really get a they don't get a vote.
[3:40:53.040 --> 3:40:59.160]  The United States as Gaddafi was laying out is is able to veto what whatever decisions
[3:40:59.160 --> 3:41:05.280]  come down by the broad body of of United Nations members whenever we want to.
[3:41:05.280 --> 3:41:11.680]  And you know that and also what it shows is how authority, the authority of institutions,
[3:41:11.680 --> 3:41:18.720]  the authority of leadership, the authority of of joint efforts is really undermined by
[3:41:18.720 --> 3:41:27.200]  individual corruption. And it is it is it is the case that we face here in America with
[3:41:27.200 --> 3:41:35.360]  the House, the Senate, local governance, mayors, governors, the executive branch, the judicial
[3:41:35.360 --> 3:41:42.000]  branch, individual corruption has incredible incredible moral hazard.
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:47.720]  We we we stand in the shadow of that moral hazard. And I and I would like to know from
[3:41:47.720 --> 3:41:53.320]  all these people who are running for office, let's say, on the conservative platform, how
[3:41:53.320 --> 3:41:58.320]  do we how do we make up the ground of such moral hazard without God? What is the real
[3:41:58.320 --> 3:42:05.600]  prescription for us to cover the ground that we've lost morally, ethically, spiritually,
[3:42:05.600 --> 3:42:11.400]  systematically, without a higher power without a higher calling without a higher order of
[3:42:11.400 --> 3:42:13.360]  ethics?
[3:42:13.360 --> 3:42:18.520]  There is no way. And that's why it's not by accident that that along the way, while all
[3:42:18.520 --> 3:42:22.640]  of this corruption has taken place, there has been a concerted effort to pull God out
[3:42:22.640 --> 3:42:28.440]  of it slowly, but surely, which has hastened in the last generation during during my childhood
[3:42:28.440 --> 3:42:32.520]  and into my adulthood. And I'm not going to stand for it. We will bring God back into

[3:47:03.640 --> 3:47:13.480]  It's white. I'm guest hosting this hour of info wars. Thank you for being with us this
[3:47:13.480 --> 3:47:17.800]  last hour. I've been hosting info wars. I'm proud to be here in the cockpit of American
[3:47:17.800 --> 3:47:24.080]  truth. If you get a chance, go watch the rest of that Moe Mark Adolfi UN speech on my Instagram.
[3:47:24.080 --> 3:47:28.560]  I'm the kind of guy who likes to poke at big tech by posting a speech like that even though
[3:47:28.560 --> 3:47:37.480]  I know the big tech would surely not have me put that content out there. For this last
[3:47:37.480 --> 3:47:43.120]  segment as we wind down the hour, I just want to talk about truth and the importance of
[3:47:43.120 --> 3:47:49.880]  truth. The importance of truth here in America and our everyday life. And the reason why
[3:47:49.880 --> 3:47:56.840]  I showed Moe Mark Adolfi is because as a Christian man, as a Catholic, I have significant disagreement
[3:47:56.840 --> 3:48:06.920]  with many practices of the Muslim faith, especially as its practice in many places in the world
[3:48:06.920 --> 3:48:16.920]  today, we can't deny that there is an extremism radical Islam. However, there's a commonality
[3:48:16.920 --> 3:48:26.480]  amongst people who seek and have the courage to profess the truth on the highest stage
[3:48:26.480 --> 3:48:33.400]  on the biggest platforms. And I've tried to over my life look at the figures and the
[3:48:33.400 --> 3:48:40.480]  people who stood to lose the most by telling the truth at a particular time and find the
[3:48:40.480 --> 3:48:46.240]  commonality amongst them. And I don't care, you know, it's it's all fruit from the same
[3:48:46.240 --> 3:48:51.680]  poisonous tree. Yeah, who killed Gaddafi and I and I wore the who killed Gaddafi shirt
[3:48:51.680 --> 3:48:58.840]  recently this two weeks ago in Chicago at the big three. And, you know, people didn't
[3:48:58.840 --> 3:49:03.280]  even know who Gaddafi was, but one Chicago rapper didn't know who Gaddafi was and he had
[3:49:03.280 --> 3:49:10.680]  a story about Gaddafi having lent. I think it was $7 million or something like that
[3:49:10.680 --> 3:49:15.200]  to Elijah Muhammad of the nation Islam to build a mosque. Now, do I agree with the nation
[3:49:15.200 --> 3:49:22.000]  of Islam in every sense? No. Do I consider Elijah Muhammad to be a prophet of mine? No.
[3:49:22.000 --> 3:49:26.560]  Do I appreciate the fact that he wanted to build a mosque in what is now worn towards
[3:49:26.560 --> 3:49:34.880]  Chicago and give young black males faith in order to guide their life? Instead of radical
[3:49:34.880 --> 3:49:39.960]  materialism, drugs and violence? I do appreciate that. I appreciate it greatly. And I can allow
[3:49:39.960 --> 3:49:47.800]  my differences of belief as a Catholic and Christian to conflict or conflate or or obstruct
[3:49:47.800 --> 3:49:52.600]  those who seek to give net positives. And that's why earlier today when Alex and I were
[3:49:52.600 --> 3:49:58.040]  talking, I want to make it clear that Christians like I who American first Christian sovereign
[3:49:58.040 --> 3:50:04.240]  is who aim to bring God more into focus in our politics and in our society are not calling
[3:50:04.240 --> 3:50:12.760]  for a theocracy. We don't want an anti God theocracy. We don't want a scientific technocracy.
[3:50:12.760 --> 3:50:18.920]  We don't want a culture of Satanism and that is what is spawned in the absence or fear
[3:50:18.920 --> 3:50:25.560]  of a of a theocracy. And there's a common out. Look, Alex Jones is Minister Lewis Farrakhan.
[3:50:25.560 --> 3:50:28.680]  You may not you may not see it. You may not understand it. They may not have the same
[3:50:28.680 --> 3:50:32.240]  beliefs, but there's a reason why they did a sit down interview together. Because the
[3:50:32.240 --> 3:50:37.320]  establishment that presides over us that that wants to put its foot on our neck for lack
[3:50:37.320 --> 3:50:43.240]  of a better phrase sees Alex Jones and the Minister Lewis Farrakhan as the same threat.
[3:50:43.240 --> 3:50:51.640]  And in that in that commonality is where we can find the unity to actually mount a fight
[3:50:51.640 --> 3:50:55.640]  and an effort against the establishment that has never been seen before in this country
[3:50:55.640 --> 3:51:00.600]  or around the world. And that's what the establishment is most afraid of. And that's why the focus
[3:51:00.600 --> 3:51:06.360]  of my campaign has been to bring uncommon figures together. And that is what the Republican
[3:51:06.360 --> 3:51:13.440]  Party has been lacking in this country. It's lacked the courage, the vision, the creativity,
[3:51:13.440 --> 3:51:21.880]  and the the the genuine honesty to bring figures together that stray from the narrative too
[3:51:21.880 --> 3:51:26.360]  much. Alex Jones is one of them. Nobody in the Republican Party would tell me to put
[3:51:26.360 --> 3:51:34.320]  an ad campaign out, an ad video campaign ad video out with Alex Jones soundbite in it.
[3:51:34.320 --> 3:51:39.040]  They would they would, you know, that that makes you persona non grata. We have to find
[3:51:39.040 --> 3:51:43.560]  the people who fight back against that, prop them up, support them. So if you can Royce
[3:51:43.560 --> 3:51:48.760]  White dot us, that's my campaign website. Surely make a donation if you can. I don't
[3:51:48.760 --> 3:51:52.880]  ask for money much, but surely we do need money to fight back against the establishment.
[3:51:52.880 --> 3:51:56.920]  But you know, it's really not about winning or losing. And that's what I wanted to say
[3:51:56.920 --> 3:52:02.320]  here. And I appreciate Alex for bringing me on and allowing me to talk about my congressional
[3:52:02.320 --> 3:52:08.280]  run. But but this is not about winning or losing. This is about faith. This is about
[3:52:08.280 --> 3:52:16.680]  restoration. This is about the restoration of national honor of sacred honor of of of
[3:52:16.680 --> 3:52:22.800]  morals and ethics and values and sacred honor are the ideas and the morals and the values
[3:52:22.800 --> 3:52:29.280]  that you will live by but are willing to die for. And we may we may die in defeat. That
[3:52:29.280 --> 3:52:36.720]  is a possible outcome that you have to confront and accept in order to be free. And that's
[3:52:36.720 --> 3:52:42.240]  been the entire motif of this of this segment in this hour that if you don't accept the
[3:52:42.240 --> 3:52:50.840]  possibility of death, the immediate and probable likelihood of death to defend your freedom
[3:52:50.840 --> 3:52:57.320]  or your citizenship, then you surely are not free. You're not free psychologically first,
[3:52:57.320 --> 3:53:02.800]  which then results in you not being free physically. And we are psychological slaves. We are slaves
[3:53:02.800 --> 3:53:09.640]  to the machine. We are a slave to the manufacture consent, which is a Chomsky idea who is way
[3:53:09.640 --> 3:53:15.280]  over there on the left and has become a mouthpiece for the establishment himself in many ways.
[3:53:15.280 --> 3:53:20.200]  But he laid some jewels before that we can look to. And now we have to go back and piece
[3:53:20.200 --> 3:53:29.240]  through all of the all of the narratives that have converged and have a spread thin in conflict
[3:53:29.240 --> 3:53:36.320]  or in disagreement and find that common thread and say, who had it right? Where did they
[3:53:36.320 --> 3:53:40.320]  have it right? Did they have to have the whole thing right? Or was the little piece that
[3:53:40.320 --> 3:53:45.960]  they had right valuable for us to take and use? And I think we have to fight right now
[3:53:45.960 --> 3:53:51.440]  within ourselves to do that. And I hear that a lot of look, I led the George Floyd protests.
[3:53:51.440 --> 3:53:57.920]  Why? Because the police departments have become pawns of the corporatocracy. Am I anti police?
[3:53:57.920 --> 3:54:01.880]  Absolutely not. We should refund and overhaul police resources. We should train our police
[3:54:01.880 --> 3:54:06.080]  much better. We should give much better mental health support to our police officer. But
[3:54:06.080 --> 3:54:12.800]  the fundamental fact is that even our police in this country, the departments, the individual
[3:54:12.800 --> 3:54:21.640]  officers have surrendered their oath to a radical materialism that they pursue instead
[3:54:21.640 --> 3:54:29.120]  of the sacred honor that comes with protecting the American people. And in that, the police
[3:54:29.120 --> 3:54:34.440]  departments are basically a huge scapegoat. And that's how they became the scapegoat.
[3:54:34.440 --> 3:54:39.560]  They became a scapegoat because there wasn't a sacred honor that that the police were willing
[3:54:39.560 --> 3:54:44.520]  to buck the establishment and fight and die for. Now, I understand the police have tried
[3:54:44.520 --> 3:54:50.320]  to, to, to push back on in many places around the country, but by and large, what has happened
[3:54:50.320 --> 3:54:56.720]  is the corporatocracy has set forth a culture of moral decay and they have positioned the
[3:54:56.720 --> 3:55:02.320]  police in between themselves and the free people and said, free people have at it, get
[3:55:02.320 --> 3:55:10.360]  high, get drunk, be godless, do crime if you need, whatever you want to do, have at it.
[3:55:10.360 --> 3:55:14.320]  And the police have to deal with that. And in some cases they make mistakes. I thought
[3:55:14.320 --> 3:55:19.280]  George Floyd was a mistake. But what I wasn't going to do, what I wasn't going to allow
[3:55:19.280 --> 3:55:24.760]  was CNN and the mainstream media establishment to ride into Minneapolis, my home where I
[3:55:24.760 --> 3:55:34.600]  was born and raised and, and, and promote an idea that they have some altruistic, some
[3:55:34.600 --> 3:55:40.480]  altruistic, you know, reason for being there, that they want to just tell the story of the
[3:55:40.480 --> 3:55:44.200]  people, that they're a friend of the people, that they want to be a voice for the people.
[3:55:44.200 --> 3:55:48.320]  It's a lie. I know it's a lie. You know it's a lie. They know it's a lie. The question
[3:55:48.320 --> 3:55:52.120]  is, what are we going to do about it? And what I decided to do was physically go out
[3:55:52.120 --> 3:55:57.160]  in the street and lead people who I disagree with politically to the front line of the
[3:55:57.160 --> 3:56:04.120]  establishment, to the Federal Reserve. I led 16,000 George Floyd protesters to the Federal
[3:56:04.120 --> 3:56:09.520]  Reserve and I said, here is where injustice starts. This is where economic tyranny is.
[3:56:09.520 --> 3:56:15.480]  This is where the elitism of our current corrupt political establishment has undermined the
[3:56:15.480 --> 3:56:22.280]  life and citizenship and freedom of George Floyd. Absolutely. But you as well. And I
[3:56:22.280 --> 3:56:25.400]  had a bunch of white liberals with purple hair and pink hair and green hair and the
[3:56:25.400 --> 3:56:30.080]  church of LGBT look at me and say, why are you saying sovereignty? What do you mean by,
[3:56:30.080 --> 3:56:33.960]  I don't care if you think Donald Trump is a white supremacist for saying sovereignty.
[3:56:33.960 --> 3:56:40.200]  I understand what the word means and I can stand before a crowd and stand on my understanding
[3:56:40.200 --> 3:56:46.280]  of that word and its importance. And right now in this country, we face a decision of
[3:56:46.280 --> 3:56:51.240]  whether or not we actually want to have a country and the decision that we make will
[3:56:51.240 --> 3:56:57.540]  have an impact on the future of the entire world, on the future of countries and nation
[3:56:57.540 --> 3:57:02.960]  states around the world, but on the future of the freedom, freedom as an idea around
[3:57:02.960 --> 3:57:08.040]  the world as it was originally meant to be when our founding fathers created this country.
[3:57:08.040 --> 3:57:14.200]  And ultimately, it will decide the spiritual faith because right now America's soul is
[3:57:14.200 --> 3:57:19.760]  lost in the wilderness and we're going to need real competent, faithful, spiritual, strong
[3:57:19.760 --> 3:57:27.120]  leaders to bring our soul out of the darkness. Thank you to the Alex Jones audience and
[3:57:27.120 --> 3:57:31.160]  the info wars audience and the info wars team for allowing me to host this hour of
[3:57:31.160 --> 3:57:36.000]  info wars. It's an honor to be here in the cockpit of American truth. You are the most
[3:57:36.000 --> 3:57:40.440]  spiritually live audience in the entire world. Thank you. God speed.
[3:58:06.000 --> 3:58:10.120]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here. Thank you for that word.
[3:58:10.120 --> 3:58:14.480]  infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions infowarsstore.com is where to
[3:58:14.480 --> 3:58:19.480]  get them folks and we do have the best supplements. I mean, just like we try our best with our
[3:58:19.480 --> 3:58:26.160]  news coverage and our information, we do the best with our supplements as well. I mean,
[3:58:26.160 --> 3:58:30.080]  look at the hair and beard support formula. Folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving
[3:58:30.080 --> 3:58:34.920]  this thing away at 75% off. By the way, it works for me in case you haven't noticed the
[3:58:34.920 --> 3:58:43.720]  hair and beard formula is working for me quite well. I might add quite well. My barber appreciates
[3:58:43.720 --> 3:58:46.920]  hair and beard support for men. I go and see him quite often now.
[3:58:46.920 --> 3:58:58.920]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[3:58:58.920 --> 3:59:14.440]  No, boy.
