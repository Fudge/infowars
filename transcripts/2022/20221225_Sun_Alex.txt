[00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:18.412]  InfoWars.
[00:00:18.412 --> 00:00:19.613]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:19.613 --> 00:00:19.953]  Today.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:46.220]  Well, it wasn't a hard prediction to make in the last few weeks that when the United States openly said it had greenlit Ukraine to start firing cruise missiles deep into Russia, attacking Russian nuclear bases, that Putin would then activate his mobile ICBMs that are on trains and trucks and begin moving them around at least twice a day.
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.483]  That way they can't be targeted by satellites and then first struck.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.180]  In a sneak attack nuclear attack.
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.521]  So Russia is now publicly prepared for a NATO U.S.
[00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:57.482]  led nuclear sneak attack.
[00:00:57.482 --> 00:00:59.702]  China is saying they're going to respond with nuclear weapons.
[00:00:59.702 --> 00:01:07.204]  Obviously, if the war escalates in a nuclear war, if anybody attacks them, things are deteriorating very, very, very quickly.
[00:01:07.204 --> 00:01:13.085]  And the average person cares about what's going on on cable TV or on Netflix.
[00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:17.826]  This is how you sleepwalk into absolute Armageddon.
[00:01:17.826 --> 00:01:19.907]  So this goes way beyond saber rattling.
[00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:29.908]  The Russians have rolled out their ICBMs that come back into the atmosphere at Mach 7, almost impossible to shoot down.
[00:01:29.908 --> 00:01:42.778]  The reentry devices, when the warhead pops open or the shell of the missile pops open, powers between 5 and 20 different warheads, some of them dummy decoys, some of them real, carrying thermonuclear payloads.
[00:01:44.386 --> 00:01:50.853]  And obviously the United States has all this stuff as well, but that's why they call it Mutually Assured Destruction.
[00:01:50.853 --> 00:01:52.374]  Total, complete insanity.
[00:01:52.374 --> 00:01:56.238]  That's coming up.
[00:01:56.238 --> 00:02:00.543]  Then obviously we have a lot of border collapse news as they announce the end of Title 42.
[00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:14.427]  The Feds admit they're expecting a total collapse, quote, calling it catastrophic, but it's being ordered by the same people cutting off our energy supplies and bringing us into World War III and injecting the public with these poison frankenshots.
[00:02:14.427 --> 00:02:18.389]  And that's why we're going to hit the poison frankenshots first.
[00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:20.809]  We come back for a break and some stations join us.
[00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:24.291]  Dr. Peter McCollough, completely vindicated, back on Twitter.
[00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:39.917]  And so many other scientists and doctors now confirmed to be suppressed by Big Pharma and Fauci, criminally also suppressing many of the natural treatments and other therapeutics that were there.
[00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:47.059]  So I really appreciate Dr. McCullough joining us right at the main kickoff of the show here in about four minutes when we come back from this short break.
[00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:49.180]  Separately, we are listeners supported.
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.621]  We can't stay on air without you.
[00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:53.922]  And with all the crazy stuff going on in the world today,
[00:02:54.753 --> 00:02:55.194]  We're good to go.
[00:03:07.822 --> 00:03:17.644]  Nitric Boost naturally has compounds that boost nitrous oxide in your blood, which, you know, any doctor like Dr. Peter McCullough can tell you is really good for your cardiovascular system.
[00:03:17.644 --> 00:03:21.045]  It's amazing, and it funds the Heart of Freedom InfoWars.
[00:03:21.045 --> 00:03:35.168]  Mushroom Max is a national best-selling brand that we've been allowed to private label of the very best known rare mushroom concentrates that aren't speed-like, but really have no nootropic effect, like Lion's Mane and so many others.
[00:03:35.168 --> 00:03:35.968]  That's the new product.
[00:03:36.488 --> 00:03:42.150]  Mushroom Boost is again a clone of an already best-selling product that this company that's working with us puts out nationally.
[00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.832]  That's available at infowarestore.com.
[00:03:44.832 --> 00:03:52.275]  Libido RX takes a lot of natural healthy compounds that don't just boost your libido, but your overall stamina and energy and just well-being.
[00:03:53.211 --> 00:03:59.874]  And then, of course, we also have Turmeric 95, which is the same as Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, just their brand and under their label.
[00:03:59.874 --> 00:04:03.336]  That's who we were already buying it from, the 95% curcuminoid.
[00:04:03.336 --> 00:04:07.618]  That's the strongest curcuminoid out there, so good for inflammation, your immune system, and more.
[00:04:07.618 --> 00:04:12.140]  Now, Turmeric 95, it's the same as Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.781]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com, back in stock.
[00:04:14.781 --> 00:04:21.204]  And that's great because our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula sold out about three weeks ago, as you know, and it's one of our best sellers.
[00:04:22.267 --> 00:04:30.531]  There are also eight other new products available at InfoWarsStore.com under the InfoWars MD banner.
[00:04:30.531 --> 00:04:36.474]  These really are the best, and they fund the operation at very, very affordable prices.
[00:04:36.474 --> 00:04:41.456]  And then I talked about how the mushroom concentrate boosts your overall well-being.
[00:04:41.456 --> 00:04:42.836]  What about your libido?
[00:04:42.836 --> 00:04:47.719]  With Libido RX, with all the known compounds that naturally and healthily supercharge your libido, this stuff's powerful.
[00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:51.740]  And I suggest you all get it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.301]  Right back with Dr. Peter McCullough.
[00:04:53.301 --> 00:04:55.622]  InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[00:04:55.622 --> 00:04:59.343]  Please share those links.
[00:04:59.343 --> 00:05:04.205]  I want you to remember two words.
[00:05:04.205 --> 00:05:05.326]  InfoWars Platinum.
[00:05:06.724 --> 00:05:07.265]  I'm good.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.860]  We're
[00:05:44.497 --> 00:05:52.484]  Read about them at InfoWarsTore.com, learn about them, and then try them out for yourself, and I know you will be a repeat customer, which is awesome.
[00:05:52.484 --> 00:05:57.949]  It'll empower your life, make your life more amazing, and it will keep us on the air of 360 wind.
[00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:00.812]  InfoWars Platinum, now available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:10.002]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:17.928]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:22.956 --> 00:06:32.912]  Big Pharma mafia that's trying to take over medicine is trying to bring back new viruses, new lockdowns, new moves to take control of our bodies.
[00:06:32.912 --> 00:06:37.699]  And there have been so many prominent scientists and doctors and medical workers that have valiantly
[00:06:39.068 --> 00:06:42.389]  Expose what's happening, whistleblow, you name it.
[00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:53.672]  But out of all of them, Dr. Peter McCullough, a very respected, already well-known doctor and researcher, has been the very tip of the spear in the last two and a half, three years, exposing this.
[00:06:53.672 --> 00:06:56.912]  He was already going to join us in studio next week, and I believe that's still going to happen.
[00:06:56.912 --> 00:06:58.713]  He's in Texas as well, but he's on the road.
[00:06:58.713 --> 00:07:02.554]  He shoots symposiums and events, and Senator Ron Johnson's
[00:07:03.914 --> 00:07:13.718]  hearings he's been having, but I wanted to get him on because he's been restored to Twitter, absolutely vindicated, and we now know what was going on behind the scenes.
[00:07:13.718 --> 00:07:22.062]  Illegal, mass-coordinated censorship with Big Pharma and the government with Big Tech.
[00:07:22.062 --> 00:07:29.045]  So it doesn't get more criminal than that, and now Governor Rhonda Sanders has impaneled a criminal statewide grand jury
[00:07:30.236 --> 00:07:34.359]  To begin to investigate the crimes of Big Pharma, government officials, you name it.
[00:07:34.359 --> 00:07:37.161]  So, Rand Paul just three weeks ago called for Fauci's arrest.
[00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:39.083]  I've been calling for it for years.
[00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:41.184]  We now know this was premeditated.
[00:07:41.184 --> 00:07:48.410]  There's a clip I'll play a little bit later, but he's going to leave us here in about 20 minutes, where Dr. Peter McCullough made the point this is going to go down in history.
[00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:55.756]  It's the biggest biological, pharmacological safety disaster in the history of mankind.
[00:07:55.756 --> 00:08:03.443]  So to give us a quick synopsis, he's usually here for two hours and covers the waterfront, of the current state of things, these big developments, is Dr. Peter McCullough.
[00:08:03.443 --> 00:08:04.003]  Thank you, doctor.
[00:08:04.003 --> 00:08:07.386]  It's safe to say you and many others aren't as vindicated.
[00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:09.068]  This is blown up in the deep state's face.
[00:08:10.578 --> 00:08:13.921]  Well, Alex, first I'd say that you're vindicated.
[00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:15.502]  Man, you made the right call.
[00:08:15.502 --> 00:08:21.667]  I've known you now for three years through the pandemic, and you've made the right call all the way.
[00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:28.852]  And just the developing breaking news now occurring almost every minute is stunning.
[00:08:28.852 --> 00:08:33.016]  Two days ago, I was invited to go onto a Twitter chat.
[00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.897]  I think it was Sebastian Gorka who invited me on.
[00:08:35.897 --> 00:08:39.299]  I saw him as one of 6,000 people on the chat.
[00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:42.300]  I uploaded a survey that someone had done.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.661]  98% of people wanted me back on Twitter.
[00:08:45.661 --> 00:09:00.968]  And so I submitted it and then within a few hours I'm back on Twitter and I've requested for now dozens of times that they stop the blacklisting, the unfollow, and the shadow banning of my account and just let my account
[00:09:01.668 --> 00:09:11.572]  Just be a natural account like anyone else's and you know what Alex overnight I had a hundred thousand new followers My following now is skyrocketing.
[00:09:11.572 --> 00:09:16.755]  I've always tweeted graphical abstracts in advancements that's going on today.
[00:09:16.755 --> 00:09:17.535]  I've retweeted
[00:09:18.755 --> 00:09:20.336]  Andrew Bridgen.
[00:09:20.336 --> 00:09:29.178]  Andrew Bridgen is a Conservative Member of Parliament in the UK and he's calling to pull all the vaccines off the market, Alex.
[00:09:29.178 --> 00:09:30.078]  Pull them all.
[00:09:30.078 --> 00:09:32.518]  This is a Member of Parliament, well respected.
[00:09:32.518 --> 00:09:34.879]  We're going to see this worldwide.
[00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:36.279]  And we actually have that video.
[00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:37.580]  I'm going to play it after you leave us.
[00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:53.346]  Retroactively create a video bibliography of what you're breaking down, but he also talks in his speech to Parliament about how he's talked to high-level whistleblowers that have confirmed that they've been ordered to cover up the evidence of heart damage caused by these shots.
[00:09:55.077 --> 00:09:56.338]  It's coming out.
[00:09:56.338 --> 00:10:03.282]  We recently had a chance to spend time with UK leading cardiologist Asim Malhotra.
[00:10:03.282 --> 00:10:08.545]  And so we had a program in the Dallas Arboretum for the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation.
[00:10:08.545 --> 00:10:16.870]  And then I appeared in a Malibu private event with Robert F. Kennedy and Malhotra, who's a very thoughtful young man.
[00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.751]  It's a tragedy that his father took the vaccine.
[00:10:19.751 --> 00:10:24.154]  His father is a very prominent doctor and died as a consequence of taking the vaccine.
[00:10:24.654 --> 00:10:36.624]  Malhotra did his own research, published two very high quality peer-reviewed manuscripts, looking at all the data and concluding that the vaccines are simply unsafe for use and they don't work.
[00:10:36.624 --> 00:10:39.146]  They don't stop COVID-19.
[00:10:39.146 --> 00:10:40.927]  We see other people stepping forward.
[00:10:40.927 --> 00:10:49.214]  European Member of Parliament, Christine Anderson, who is calling this entire COVID-19 vaccine program a fraud.
[00:10:50.290 --> 00:11:06.604]  We have Member of Parliament Roos from the Netherlands who's called out the Pfizer executive who now admits under testimony in the European Parliament that Pfizer was never tested to see if it would stop transmission of the virus.
[00:11:06.604 --> 00:11:09.647]  And so we have a situation now, Alex, as you called it.
[00:11:10.308 --> 00:11:11.749]  It's imploding.
[00:11:11.749 --> 00:11:14.190]  It's imploding worldwide.
[00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:19.312]  And we put a punctuation mark on this on December 7th, 2022 in the U.S.
[00:11:19.312 --> 00:11:20.572]  Senate.
[00:11:20.572 --> 00:11:23.893]  Special panel held by Ron Johnson.
[00:11:23.893 --> 00:11:25.374]  How big is this to have?
[00:11:26.601 --> 00:11:36.910]  Governor DeSantis impaneling a statewide task force of grand juries to investigate every aspect, the government, the censorship, the big pharma lying.
[00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.152]  I mean, they've all obviously committed crimes.
[00:11:39.152 --> 00:11:42.095]  It's open and shut, just like with Sam Bankman Freed.
[00:11:42.095 --> 00:11:44.136]  It's just open and shut.
[00:11:44.136 --> 00:11:46.919]  What do you make of that A and B?
[00:11:46.919 --> 00:11:49.021]  What do you think the deep state's response is going to be?
[00:11:50.814 --> 00:12:05.104]  I tell you, the deep state has to be extremely worried because there are state actors involved, those that are not government officials, but many of the people involved will be government officials.
[00:12:05.104 --> 00:12:17.112]  And it goes to show when a state has a strong attorney general, my colleague, Joe Ledepo, MD, PhD, Harvard trained, is DeSantis' right-hand man on medical affairs.
[00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:20.434]  You know, in Texas, Alice, we don't have a surgeon general.
[00:12:21.034 --> 00:12:25.700]  And I think it's a giant mistake for a state to have no doctor in charge.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.441]  It's ridiculous.
[00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:30.085]  Yeah, and LeDapo has been terrific.
[00:12:30.085 --> 00:12:33.489]  He supported DeSantis and it's now clear
[00:12:34.167 --> 00:12:37.369]  They're going to go after areas of wrongful advertising.
[00:12:37.369 --> 00:12:38.971]  We can just take that one.
[00:12:38.971 --> 00:12:43.094]  Advertising for pharmaceuticals is governed by the Landman Act, the U.S.
[00:12:43.094 --> 00:12:44.475]  Drug and Cosmetic Act.
[00:12:44.475 --> 00:12:47.917]  And they even advertised it before it was emergency approved for children.
[00:12:47.917 --> 00:12:50.339]  They advertised ads on Sesame Street.
[00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:51.100]  That's illegal, isn't it?
[00:12:51.894 --> 00:12:53.075]  Yeah, it's illegal.
[00:12:53.075 --> 00:13:04.744]  And matter of fact, you know, you know, when any drug is advertised on TV, there's all the disclaimers of the side effects, but they're not giving any of the disclaimers of the side effects on the COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:13:04.744 --> 00:13:07.045]  Everybody should view that as being illegal.
[00:13:07.045 --> 00:13:13.150]  And you know, in the state of Kansas, they've already taken action and pulled all the vaccine ads off TV.
[00:13:13.996 --> 00:13:24.903]  We know now, Alex, this is a stunning revelation that the US Health and Human Services and the White House had a program called the COVID Community Corps.
[00:13:25.572 --> 00:13:34.218]  The COVID Community Corps, and that program infused over $13 billion to 276 agencies.
[00:13:34.218 --> 00:13:37.700]  It's on their website, COVID Community Corps.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:50.369]  And there, the money flowed to all the medical societies, the American Association of Pediatrics, American College of Pediatrics, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the American Medical Association.
[00:13:50.369 --> 00:13:55.392]  It flowed to churches, black and Hispanic groups, Hollywood,
[00:13:56.104 --> 00:14:01.169]  The sports teams like the NFL, these are massive amounts of money.
[00:14:01.169 --> 00:14:04.593]  And so this is the largest government bribe in history.
[00:14:04.593 --> 00:14:11.220]  And that explains why obstetricians and gynecologists went along with vaccination in pregnant women.
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.082]  They were bribed by the U.S.
[00:14:13.082 --> 00:14:13.463]  government.
[00:14:14.818 --> 00:14:17.541]  I want to continue with the 35,000 foot view.
[00:14:17.541 --> 00:14:21.866]  We're still a few minutes to break, but just continue with the 35,000 foot view.
[00:14:21.866 --> 00:14:24.589]  The whole world's waking up and turning against this.
[00:14:24.589 --> 00:14:25.891]  How do you see this unfolding now?
[00:14:27.512 --> 00:14:32.296]  What we're going to see is we're going to see continued pockets now of leadership.
[00:14:32.296 --> 00:14:40.264]  I mentioned Senator Ron Johnson, who's been absolutely the leader in the United States, holding yet another Senate panel.
[00:14:40.264 --> 00:14:44.328]  December closed session was December 6th, open session December 7th.
[00:14:44.328 --> 00:14:45.108]  I moderated.
[00:14:45.108 --> 00:14:48.451]  You see me sitting on Johnson's left.
[00:14:48.451 --> 00:14:51.074]  Esteemed panel of expert doctors, vaccine.
[00:14:51.555 --> 00:14:54.842]  Consultants, lawyers, patients, and others.
[00:14:54.842 --> 00:14:57.568]  And the title of the program was COVID-19 Vaccines.
[00:14:57.568 --> 00:14:58.210]  What are they?
[00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:58.891]  How do they work?
[00:14:59.711 --> 00:15:02.532]  And what are the safety concerns?
[00:15:02.532 --> 00:15:04.572]  And we got it all out in the open.
[00:15:04.572 --> 00:15:10.934]  The conclusion, and I gave it for the panel, conclusion was pull the vaccines off the market.
[00:15:10.934 --> 00:15:13.975]  They should have been pulled off before February of 2021.
[00:15:13.975 --> 00:15:15.755]  It's gone on too long.
[00:15:15.755 --> 00:15:21.516]  And these pockets, by the way, it wasn't just Senator Johnson, Senator Roger Marshall from Kansas joined us.
[00:15:21.516 --> 00:15:23.537]  So Johnson has helped
[00:15:23.977 --> 00:15:29.162]  We've seen now a new Prime Minister of Alberta, Canada.
[00:15:29.162 --> 00:15:31.484]  She's clearly breaking rank.
[00:15:31.484 --> 00:15:40.692]  We've mentioned Andrew Bridgen in the UK, Malcolm Roberts in Australia, and former Member of Parliament Craig Kelly.
[00:15:40.692 --> 00:15:41.432]  I'm going to go visit.
[00:15:42.073 --> 00:15:42.754]  We're good to go.
[00:16:00.529 --> 00:16:05.074]  I'm taking a lot of supplements over the years, since high school, and they had great effects.
[00:16:05.074 --> 00:16:08.758]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[00:16:08.758 --> 00:16:19.589]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[00:16:19.589 --> 00:16:20.951]  These products work great for women as well.
[00:16:21.551 --> 00:16:23.953]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[00:16:23.953 --> 00:16:26.435]  It's a number one national bestseller under another name.
[00:16:26.435 --> 00:16:32.240]  We got it discounted for 40% off InfoWarsTore.com under the label InfoWars Platinum.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.502]  We've also got HGH Max Boost.
[00:16:34.502 --> 00:16:35.803]  Read all about it.
[00:16:35.803 --> 00:16:37.165]  Be very safe with it.
[00:16:37.165 --> 00:16:40.588]  I'd take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[00:16:40.588 --> 00:16:42.109]  Don't do it during the day.
[00:16:42.109 --> 00:16:45.131]  1776 testosterone boost.
[00:16:45.131 --> 00:16:46.192]  Totally incredible.
[00:16:46.192 --> 00:16:47.113]  Go read about them.
[00:16:47.113 --> 00:16:47.914]  Learn more about them.
[00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:49.035]  We're good.
[00:17:01.525 --> 00:17:06.428]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[00:17:06.428 --> 00:17:12.831]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:17.954]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:19.675]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[00:17:19.675 --> 00:17:26.099]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who've supported InfoWars are the real reason we've had this success.
[00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:32.240]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the Noodle Order we've ever had.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.401]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[00:17:36.401 --> 00:17:45.783]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[00:17:45.783 --> 00:17:47.143]  God bless you all.
[00:17:47.143 --> 00:17:48.184]  I salute you.
[00:17:48.184 --> 00:17:49.204]  I thank you.
[00:17:49.204 --> 00:17:54.665]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[00:17:55.305 --> 00:17:56.626]  The fight is my fight.
[00:17:56.626 --> 00:17:57.266]  It's your fight.
[00:17:57.266 --> 00:17:58.006]  It's our fight.
[00:17:58.006 --> 00:18:00.087]  God bless you all.
[00:18:00.087 --> 00:18:03.108]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered.
[00:18:03.108 --> 00:18:05.229]  And InfoWars has been the tip of spear against tyranny.
[00:18:05.229 --> 00:18:11.312]  And when it comes to products we sell to fund our operation, they're just like our news and information.
[00:18:11.312 --> 00:18:13.513]  They are powerful and they change the world.
[00:18:14.212 --> 00:18:20.076]  The Real Red Pill Plus is one of our top sellers, but for over two years, it's been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns.
[00:18:20.076 --> 00:18:21.677]  It's finally back in stock.

[00:19:00.629 --> 00:19:08.315]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[00:19:08.315 --> 00:19:10.377]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[00:19:10.377 --> 00:19:12.078]  They know we're telling the truth.
[00:19:12.078 --> 00:19:13.639]  They know we've got their number.
[00:19:13.639 --> 00:19:18.383]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[00:19:18.383 --> 00:19:20.965]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds.
[00:19:21.505 --> 00:19:21.705]  Thank you.
[00:19:37.702 --> 00:19:42.545]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:15.896 --> 00:20:20.919]  Final segment with the completely vindicated tip of the spear, Dr. Peter McCullough.
[00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:32.207]  Then, coming up, ladies and gentlemen, the economist, the stock trader, so well-known, Edward Dowd, can document not just that there is global mass death from these shots,
[00:20:33.126 --> 00:20:37.390]  But also that there is a coordinated worldwide economic collapse.
[00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:41.814]  We'll single out who's doing it and what's coming next and how to stop them next hour.
[00:20:41.814 --> 00:20:44.977]  I'm gonna get into Russia threatening new levels of nuclear war, the U.S.
[00:20:44.977 --> 00:20:46.439]  streamlining attacks inside Russia.
[00:20:46.439 --> 00:20:48.280]  It is just completely insane.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:54.126]  Coming up next segment after I play a few of the videos that Dr. McCullough mentioned after he leaves, but I want those on the record.
[00:20:54.126 --> 00:20:54.867]  It's such big news.
[00:20:56.408 --> 00:21:04.833]  I was asking Dr. McCullough what he wanted to get to next, and he said, let's talk about how unprecedented three journalists, not that old, dying at the World Cup.
[00:21:04.833 --> 00:21:08.114]  They first said, oh, they must be supporting gays is why they're dead.
[00:21:08.114 --> 00:21:10.856]  No, we're now getting the coroner's reports.
[00:21:10.856 --> 00:21:15.178]  Exploding arteries, exploding aortas, heart attacks.
[00:21:15.178 --> 00:21:17.860]  One of them, sports reporter Grant Wall, died of an
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.826]  Aortic, that's your big artery coming on top of your heart.
[00:21:21.826 --> 00:21:23.849]  Aneurysm at World Cup.
[00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:26.413]  So, Dr. McCullough, we're seeing a lot of this, aren't we?
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:28.720]  We are.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:36.343]  It's in my sub stack that there can be what's called aortic dissection and rupture after COVID-19 vaccination.
[00:21:36.343 --> 00:21:43.085]  We know that the vaccine does induce tremendous surges in blood pressure, vascular strain.
[00:21:43.085 --> 00:21:44.526]  I mean, this is a young man.
[00:21:44.526 --> 00:21:50.208]  This is not the picture of someone who would die of an aneurysmal rupture.
[00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:50.288]  This
[00:21:51.508 --> 00:21:59.793]  In my view, just like the other two that have died there, it's due to the COVID-19 vaccine until proven otherwise.
[00:21:59.793 --> 00:22:06.817]  And so it's pretty clear that if the family wants to clear it up, they can come out and tell us if they haven't taken the vaccine, we can rule it out.
[00:22:06.817 --> 00:22:14.061]  But now that autopsy study after autopsy study shows that in fact, the vaccines are the cause of death.
[00:22:14.061 --> 00:22:17.843]  A recent one by Schwab and colleagues from Heidelberg, Germany,
[00:22:18.596 --> 00:22:24.138]  Show that in people who died within 20 days of taking the vaccine, they were found dead at home.
[00:22:24.138 --> 00:22:36.261]  Alex, 71% had a clear agreed upon vaccine induced cause of death, heart damage, a blood clot, neurologic damage.
[00:22:36.261 --> 00:22:37.742]  These are not controversial.
[00:22:37.742 --> 00:22:39.642]  The FDA says they can happen.
[00:22:39.642 --> 00:22:42.943]  The autopsy study are showing that it happens.
[00:22:42.943 --> 00:22:48.025]  And when people die after taking the vaccine, it is due to the vaccine until proven otherwise.
[00:22:49.949 --> 00:22:56.515]  You were on my show two and a half years ago, even before the CDC put the document out warning of heart attacks and blood clots.
[00:22:56.515 --> 00:23:03.341]  We know from the research of similar vaccine trials or mRNA shots in lab rats and other things that this was happening.
[00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:08.926]  So if you knew, if the CDC knew on their own website, why did they then roll this out?
[00:23:09.927 --> 00:23:12.349]  There's obviously a premeditated nature to this.
[00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:16.211]  I know privately a few years ago you confided that that's where you thought it was going.
[00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:19.854]  Now you've been a lot more bold about the master plan, the 50,000 foot view on this doc.
[00:23:23.072 --> 00:23:24.833]  You know, we have records now.
[00:23:24.833 --> 00:23:33.380]  Ralph Baric at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the most knowledgeable person on coronavirus, also the quietest person over the last three years.
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:39.445]  He was a DARPA and BARDA consultant and researcher, had won millions of dollars in grants.
[00:23:39.445 --> 00:23:47.152]  He showed in 1992 that beta coronaviruses given in high enough dosage could cause myocarditis in animal models.
[00:23:47.652 --> 00:23:58.202]  So that's the reason why we knew COVID itself could cause myocarditis and that's the reason why the NCAA Big Ten had a myocarditis screening program in 2020 with COVID.
[00:23:58.202 --> 00:23:59.383]  So did the military.
[00:23:59.383 --> 00:24:02.186]  They found very few cases of myocarditis.
[00:24:02.666 --> 00:24:11.092]  So they packed up their screening programs and once the vaccines were started, that's when the damage really happened and no one was looking for it.
[00:24:11.092 --> 00:24:14.114]  You know, this is a tragedy what's going on now.
[00:24:14.114 --> 00:24:26.222]  Two papers, one by Mansougian and the other one by Lepesic, show that about 2.5% of people who take a vaccine develop heart damage.
[00:24:26.222 --> 00:24:29.604]  50% of the time they can't feel it and the first manifestation
[00:24:30.288 --> 00:24:31.930]  Is sudden cardiac arrest.
[00:24:47.788 --> 00:24:49.009]  There's so many points to hit.
[00:24:49.009 --> 00:24:50.730]  You'll be with us next Tuesday.
[00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:53.151]  Actually, remotely, we'll cover the waterfront.
[00:24:53.151 --> 00:24:55.172]  But I know the general audience listens to you.
[00:24:55.172 --> 00:24:55.953]  They know about all this.
[00:24:55.953 --> 00:24:57.734]  They're like, why are you telling us again?
[00:24:57.734 --> 00:25:02.056]  Well, because a lot of people still don't know, and they're going to try to push this whole agenda.
[00:25:02.056 --> 00:25:03.917]  They're still trying to make the military take it.
[00:25:03.917 --> 00:25:06.158]  Blue cities are still trying to make the children take it.
[00:25:06.158 --> 00:25:07.339]  This fight is far from over.
[00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:08.239]  We're starting to win.
[00:25:08.239 --> 00:25:10.901]  We're getting major traction, but don't we need to push harder than ever?
[00:25:12.754 --> 00:25:13.474]  We do.
[00:25:13.474 --> 00:25:14.015]  It's clear.
[00:25:14.015 --> 00:25:20.318]  You know, I gave a press interview outside my hotel in Washington before I testified in the Senate.
[00:25:20.318 --> 00:25:25.761]  And, you know, one of the workers who worked at the hotel, she came up to me, she goes, what's all this about?
[00:25:25.761 --> 00:25:31.344]  I said, we're, you know, we're concerned about the vaccines that cause blood clots and heart damage.
[00:25:31.344 --> 00:25:32.665]  And she goes, I took two of these.
[00:25:32.665 --> 00:25:34.226]  I had no idea.
[00:25:34.226 --> 00:25:37.708]  So Alex, there are still people out there that have no idea.
[00:25:37.708 --> 00:25:40.269]  They're just, you know, in their usual walks of life.
[00:25:41.005 --> 00:25:43.426]  And our government has betrayed them.
[00:25:43.426 --> 00:25:48.108]  Our government is not warning people what can happen with these shots.
[00:25:48.108 --> 00:25:55.171]  And the same people doing this, even if somebody's a sociopath that doesn't care about folks getting hurt, just because you know it's hurting you, you don't do it.
[00:25:55.171 --> 00:25:56.672]  It's going to break down society.
[00:25:56.672 --> 00:25:58.693]  The same people doing it are going to expand this.
[00:25:58.693 --> 00:25:59.713]  They're going to make it forced.
[00:25:59.713 --> 00:26:00.394]  They already are.
[00:26:00.394 --> 00:26:02.455]  We've got to stop this now.
[00:26:02.455 --> 00:26:07.177]  In the last three minutes we have left, I know you wanted to hit on how big the Twitter files are and why Fauci
[00:26:07.717 --> 00:26:09.478]  The Twitter files are going to be a bombshell.
[00:26:09.478 --> 00:26:10.239]  There's no doubt about it.
[00:26:10.239 --> 00:26:14.421]  We learned through American First Legal that the CDC was actively meeting with Twitter
[00:26:31.212 --> 00:26:42.917]  Figuring out which accounts to censor, shadowban, how to channel information to give a message that's only positive on the vaccines, that is to suppress any information on treatment.
[00:26:42.917 --> 00:26:45.979]  Look at 98% of people want to be on Twitter, Alex.
[00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:52.782]  It's clear that I was giving the world a fair, balanced analysis of what's going on.
[00:26:52.782 --> 00:26:53.602]  And you're right.
[00:26:53.602 --> 00:26:58.825]  Yesterday, Anthony Fauci said that Twitter is a quote, cesspool of information.
[00:26:59.511 --> 00:27:03.314]  Well, I can tell you the CDC was taking Twitter very seriously.
[00:27:03.314 --> 00:27:05.195]  It wasn't a cesspool at all.
[00:27:05.195 --> 00:27:09.178]  In fact, it was a valuable source of scientific information.
[00:27:09.178 --> 00:27:12.101]  And then finally, I've had my day and I'm back on Twitter.
[00:27:12.101 --> 00:27:14.562]  I'm going to help other scientists go on.
[00:27:14.562 --> 00:27:21.788]  Jay Bhattacharya, who's in my frequent contributor group at Fox News, Jay was invited to go into the Twitter headquarters.
[00:27:22.248 --> 00:27:24.130]  And hopefully he made an impact.
[00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:25.270]  I think he did.
[00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:28.793]  Now, Jay has been one of the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration.
[00:27:28.793 --> 00:27:37.899]  He's really been focused on public health measures, lockdowns, masks, and just appropriate precautions for our seniors.
[00:27:37.899 --> 00:27:41.382]  But Bhattacharya has been directly attacked by Fauci.
[00:27:41.382 --> 00:27:47.246]  Bhattacharya must have made the case to let myself, other eminent scientists, back on Twitter.
[00:27:47.246 --> 00:27:51.609]  And I'm going to continue the same, just bringing the world the truth
[00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:55.325]  And, you know, I reflexively do it across all the platforms.
[00:27:55.325 --> 00:27:59.347]  I've built up Getter, TrueSocial, Substack, and Telegraph.
[00:27:59.347 --> 00:28:04.369]  Alright, well, regardless, if Musk isn't letting me back, he's still a hero for what he's doing.
[00:28:04.369 --> 00:28:09.992]  I cannot deny the fruits of the tree, and I like the direction he's moving in, so we should all support him in exactly.
[00:28:09.992 --> 00:28:16.875]  Meeting with prominent, respected scientists, and then freeing the other prominent scientists is critical to freedom on this planet.
[00:28:16.875 --> 00:28:17.795]  Dr. Peter McCullough,
[00:28:18.316 --> 00:28:19.678]  I really appreciate you.
[00:28:19.678 --> 00:28:22.262]  People can find you at drpetermccullohmd.com.
[00:28:22.262 --> 00:28:30.855]  I know you've also launched with some prominent folks a one-stop online medical consultation and prescription system that I know we're really promoting.
[00:28:30.855 --> 00:28:31.577]  How do people find that?
[00:28:33.084 --> 00:28:34.705]  It's the wellness company.
[00:28:34.705 --> 00:28:38.807]  It is a nationwide alternative health system platform.
[00:28:38.807 --> 00:28:41.689]  Go to TWC.health.
[00:28:41.689 --> 00:28:42.269]  Sign up.
[00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:49.534]  It's $10 a month for the cell phone app, access to doctors, medications, exemptions from taking the vaccine.
[00:28:49.534 --> 00:28:51.995]  This is what a lot of people are looking for.
[00:28:51.995 --> 00:28:54.316]  Alex, your show's been a wonderful supporter.
[00:28:54.316 --> 00:28:54.697]  That's right.
[00:28:54.697 --> 00:28:56.057]  The truth will set us free.
[00:28:56.057 --> 00:28:56.658]  Thank you, doctor.
[00:28:56.658 --> 00:28:58.519]  Talk to you next Tuesday.
[00:28:58.519 --> 00:28:58.799]  Thank you.
[00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:09.675]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[00:29:09.675 --> 00:29:19.362]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[00:29:19.362 --> 00:29:30.389]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of FAN, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:31.590]  Thank you.
[00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:06.332]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[00:30:06.332 --> 00:30:12.754]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[00:30:12.754 --> 00:30:17.875]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[00:30:17.875 --> 00:30:19.575]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[00:30:19.575 --> 00:30:25.997]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support an InfoWars are the real reason you have the success.
[00:30:26.717 --> 00:30:32.140]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:36.302]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[00:30:36.302 --> 00:30:45.766]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[00:30:45.766 --> 00:30:47.067]  God bless you all.
[00:30:47.067 --> 00:30:48.108]  I salute you.
[00:30:48.108 --> 00:30:49.108]  I thank you.
[00:30:49.108 --> 00:30:54.571]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this dream is happening.
[00:30:55.191 --> 00:30:56.532]  The fight is my fight.
[00:30:56.532 --> 00:30:57.172]  It's your fight.
[00:30:57.172 --> 00:30:57.913]  It's our fight.
[00:30:57.913 --> 00:31:00.534]  God bless you all.
[00:31:00.534 --> 00:31:05.116]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing Infowars?
[00:31:05.116 --> 00:31:08.198]  Attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[00:31:08.198 --> 00:31:10.259]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[00:31:10.259 --> 00:31:11.960]  They know we're telling the truth.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.521]  They know we've got their number.
[00:31:13.521 --> 00:31:18.243]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:20.845]  And God gave us through Mother Nature incredible compounds.
[00:31:21.385 --> 00:31:22.006]  We're good to go.
[00:31:37.563 --> 00:31:38.243]  I don't know.
[00:32:00.373 --> 00:32:07.576]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars live products have always been the highest quality, triple tested, and you've seen the rave reviews.
[00:32:07.576 --> 00:32:18.580]  But doing deep research, we made contact with the top company in the United States, and it turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials to the companies that we were already using.
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:27.144]  So we've gone directly to the source, and that means we can give you lower prices on the very same high quality supplements, and in some cases, even better.
[00:32:27.144 --> 00:32:27.724]  Introducing
[00:32:28.564 --> 00:32:33.147]  InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:33.147 --> 00:32:38.410]  InfoWarsMD exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com has 10 new products.
[00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:46.615]  Turmeric 95, Lipido RX, Better Mood, Nitric Boost, Muchroom Max, Anitropin, Angel's Vitality Collagen,
[00:32:47.015 --> 00:32:49.096]  Superfood greens and more.
[00:32:49.096 --> 00:32:50.716]  Just take the superfood greens.
[00:32:50.716 --> 00:32:58.199]  This is the highest quality greens out there, and it's at a price way, way lower than the same product on store shelves for up to twice the cost.
[00:32:58.199 --> 00:33:00.840]  Find InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:06.742]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:15.589 --> 00:33:16.832]  I want to bring down the new world record.
[00:33:40.254 --> 00:33:46.504]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:46.504 --> 00:33:48.767]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:54.690]  Let that sink in where the best there is.
[00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.351]  And I say that very humbly, because I'm not that good.
[00:33:58.351 --> 00:33:59.751]  But we're all we got.
[00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:07.673]  I know you're humble as well, but you understand as viewers and listeners of this broadcast, you are the heart of the awakening.
[00:34:07.673 --> 00:34:18.315]  You are the heart of the knowledge of how to address the New World Order, how to stop the New World Order, and how to build a new, better future for our species with God's divine intervention.
[00:34:20.359 --> 00:34:31.183]  Look, obviously the big news today is the escalation in Russia, and I just keep every week reporting how the escalation gets worse, and we're out of control, and we're officially at war with Russia, and the U.S.
[00:34:31.183 --> 00:34:37.746]  is helping bomb Russia, and Russia's now readying its mobile nukes.
[00:34:37.746 --> 00:34:41.308]  This is a global emergency alert.
[00:34:41.308 --> 00:34:44.129]  Russia readies ICBMs, threatens to nuke West after U.S.
[00:34:44.129 --> 00:34:47.890]  Green Line's missile attacks on Russia.
[00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:48.811]  This is insanity.
[00:34:49.847 --> 00:34:54.168]  But why am I spending so much time on the poison shots?
[00:34:54.168 --> 00:35:12.093]  Because it's the globalists that are the dominant power group in the world, allied with the chi-coms at one level, that are rolling these deadly shots out to collapse civilization, and if we can stop that aspect of the attack, we derail their whole operation.
[00:35:12.093 --> 00:35:13.914]  It's very hard to get the public that's grown up
[00:35:14.861 --> 00:35:25.665]  Relatively safe and free, compared to what we're about to be, about nuclear war and, oh, a war in Russia, a war in Ukraine, in Central Europe, in Eastern Europe.
[00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:27.665]  What's the big deal?
[00:35:27.665 --> 00:35:30.847]  It's like another planet, but it's not another planet.
[00:35:30.847 --> 00:35:34.588]  It's only 4,000 or 5,000 miles away.
[00:35:34.588 --> 00:35:40.670]  So, I've been hammering the poison shots because at some place we're getting something done.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:58.691]  The situation with the United States and our troops over there fighting the Russians for years, but now it's official, is something that really makes me have anxiety.
[00:35:58.691 --> 00:36:00.292]  And few things do.
[00:36:00.292 --> 00:36:06.577]  Because it's so dangerous, it's so needless, it's so reckless, and the corrupt, decadent people running our world
[00:36:07.779 --> 00:36:12.542]  Get off on this and they enjoy the brinksmanship and the danger.
[00:36:12.542 --> 00:36:13.923]  That's why people go and they gamble.
[00:36:13.923 --> 00:36:21.549]  They like to see the roulette wheel and they like to see the cards dealt and it gives people excitement and it releases dopamine in the brain.
[00:36:21.549 --> 00:36:25.571]  And as long as you're not a degenerate gambler, you just do it for fun, it's not a bad thing.
[00:36:25.571 --> 00:36:28.033]  But we know it has a dangerous side.
[00:36:28.033 --> 00:36:31.215]  Well, war just goes from bad to worse and it's the ultimate drug.
[00:36:36.072 --> 00:36:38.215]  We need to warn everybody we know about the situation.
[00:36:38.215 --> 00:36:43.421]  We need to lay out how serious it is and the history of it and where it's obviously going.
[00:36:43.421 --> 00:36:46.324]  And we need to get right with God.
[00:36:46.324 --> 00:36:51.330]  I want to get back to the poison shots, then I'm going to get into this news on the Russia-Ukraine escalation.
[00:36:53.254 --> 00:37:01.258]  But first, I just want to encourage listeners to protect yourselves and to boost your immune systems and to be healthier and to lead better lives.
[00:37:01.258 --> 00:37:04.759]  And a great way to do that is with high-quality supplementation.
[00:37:04.759 --> 00:37:10.542]  And all the products we sell are top of the line, the best, the purest, the strongest, the cleanest.
[00:37:10.542 --> 00:37:14.003]  And you get discounts on them from where you would get them other places.
[00:37:14.003 --> 00:37:20.826]  Because almost all of our products, except for X2, X3, DNA Force, and a few others, are not proprietary.
[00:37:22.577 --> 00:37:28.101]  Private labels of already best-selling products that are highly rated and from the best companies.
[00:37:28.101 --> 00:37:40.209]  And we were already getting the best supplements, but now we've broken through on two fronts to the actual two big national makers where we were already getting our raw material from through other large companies, but they were middlemen.
[00:37:41.474 --> 00:37:48.419]  And so, the first of 10 products just rolled out that are new, InfoWars MD, and they're just incredible.
[00:37:48.419 --> 00:37:50.141]  This is 95% turmeric.
[00:37:50.141 --> 00:37:52.342]  That's why it's called Turmeric 95.
[00:37:52.342 --> 00:37:53.863]  The strongest curcumin oil you can get.
[00:37:53.863 --> 00:37:58.427]  Unbelievable what it does for your inflammation, your cells, your immune system.
[00:37:58.427 --> 00:38:01.289]  It's just so important.
[00:38:01.289 --> 00:38:04.151]  Especially in the winter months with what's going on.
[00:38:04.151 --> 00:38:08.294]  So, Turmeric 95, discounted, out of the gates, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:38:10.998 --> 00:38:12.799]  I'm not going to go over all the ingredients, folks.
[00:38:12.799 --> 00:38:21.965]  Nitric Boost has a bunch of known natural compounds that massively boost nitrous oxide in your blood that is so good for cleaning out your arteries and making your heart be healthy.
[00:38:21.965 --> 00:38:25.427]  Everybody should be taking this, especially folks 40 or older.
[00:38:25.427 --> 00:38:27.488]  It's now available.
[00:38:27.488 --> 00:38:35.954]  We also have Mushroom Max, which is a clone of one of the best-selling national brands of known rare mushroom concentrates.
[00:38:37.395 --> 00:38:38.015]  That's great.
[00:38:59.844 --> 00:39:02.825]  Guaranteed lower than anybody else is selling it.
[00:39:02.825 --> 00:39:05.066]  So that's available as well.
[00:39:05.066 --> 00:39:07.086]  And then we have Libido RX.
[00:39:07.086 --> 00:39:10.067]  Now, this is a bunch of natural compounds.
[00:39:10.067 --> 00:39:15.608]  There's like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 different things in this.
[00:39:15.608 --> 00:39:23.111]  And personally, this works for me way better than something like Cialis or Viagra.
[00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:27.432]  And not that I need it, but you get older, you go for your yearly checkup, the doctor goes, hey, you want some Cialis?
[00:39:28.368 --> 00:39:29.869]  No, I don't think so.
[00:39:44.113 --> 00:39:49.518]  Remember being like 16 and you would have painful erections?
[00:39:49.518 --> 00:39:51.060]  So look out.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:56.285]  All of these, ladies and gentlemen, are really powerful and are the real deal.
[00:39:56.285 --> 00:39:58.247]  So be careful with it all.
[00:39:58.247 --> 00:39:59.988]  There's six other products as well.
[00:40:00.749 --> 00:40:02.310]  They don't have a lot of the CBD.
[00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:04.451]  That's all selling out as we speak.
[00:40:04.451 --> 00:40:05.071]  It's amazing.
[00:40:05.071 --> 00:40:06.672]  High quality, very low price as well.
[00:40:06.672 --> 00:40:08.653]  We'll have more of that in the new year.
[00:40:08.653 --> 00:40:09.933]  And a lot of this stuff is selling out.
[00:40:09.933 --> 00:40:12.575]  We also have Vitamin Mineral Fusion selling out very soon.
[00:40:12.575 --> 00:40:14.055]  Despite that, it's an excellent formula.
[00:40:14.055 --> 00:40:15.476]  We're still going to keep it discounted.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.741]  50% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:40:33.732 --> 00:40:34.273]  Things like that.
[00:40:34.273 --> 00:40:36.415]  But LabidaRx is really, really amazing.
[00:40:36.415 --> 00:40:37.856]  And they all compliment each other.
[00:40:37.856 --> 00:40:40.899]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:40:40.899 --> 00:40:43.542]  And please do your Christmas shopping with us.
[00:40:43.542 --> 00:40:44.743]  We will stay on air.
[00:40:44.743 --> 00:40:46.325]  Even Associated Press reported that.
[00:40:46.325 --> 00:40:50.729]  They said as long as Jones' supporters keep supporting him, Jones has got two years of appeals.
[00:40:50.729 --> 00:40:51.610]  He's going to win the appeals.
[00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:54.192]  There's no way we can't if we have the money for the appeals.
[00:40:54.192 --> 00:40:55.013]  So we're not going anywhere.
[00:40:56.455 --> 00:40:58.916]  And that's the reality of this.
[00:40:58.916 --> 00:41:00.217]  And we just need your support.
[00:41:00.217 --> 00:41:00.998]  Plus, these are great products.
[00:41:00.998 --> 00:41:04.881]  So please do some of your Christmas shopping or all of it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:41:04.881 --> 00:41:09.344]  And finally, the Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:41:09.344 --> 00:41:12.887]  This is a number one bestseller.
[00:41:12.887 --> 00:41:14.949]  It was in the top ten for like three, four months.
[00:41:15.928 --> 00:41:17.329]  It really is powerful.
[00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:18.849]  It's a good read, a riveting read.
[00:41:18.849 --> 00:41:19.650]  It's all documented.
[00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:26.993]  If you want to know about the New World Order, you want to know how to stop them in the war for the world, the great reset in the war for the world, we have signed, and we have a fundraiser, signed copies.
[00:41:26.993 --> 00:41:28.753]  I want to thank all of you that have gotten a signed copy.
[00:41:28.753 --> 00:41:31.154]  If you haven't got a signed copy, it's a fundraiser.
[00:41:31.154 --> 00:41:32.135]  Keep us on air.
[00:41:32.135 --> 00:41:35.676]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:41:43.161 --> 00:41:48.784]  So, excuse me, I was eating some almonds during the break.
[00:41:48.784 --> 00:41:51.225]  Got one, I'm going down the wrong way there.
[00:41:51.225 --> 00:41:53.486]  So, I kind of eat like the cookie monster during breaks.
[00:41:53.486 --> 00:41:57.768]  I'm like, forget to swallow a piece of it.
[00:41:57.768 --> 00:41:58.688]  It's in my lungs.
[00:41:58.688 --> 00:42:00.229]  It starts getting in my lungs.
[00:42:00.229 --> 00:42:00.829]  Not very fun.
[00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:04.451]  What you really don't want to get in your lungs is these viruses, ladies and gentlemen, and that is why
[00:42:05.523 --> 00:42:06.023]  We're good to go.
[00:42:21.408 --> 00:42:23.350]  Edward Dowd that's coming on.
[00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:24.891]  And all of this.
[00:42:24.891 --> 00:42:26.872]  This is earth-changing information.
[00:42:26.872 --> 00:42:27.593]  World-changing.

[00:42:33.337 --> 00:42:36.079]  But remember, we're not just some regular entertainment show.
[00:42:36.079 --> 00:42:37.480]  We're really trying to change the world.

[00:43:00.976 --> 00:43:04.638]  Have you tried taking the Real Red Pill?
[00:43:04.638 --> 00:43:10.660]  A one-of-a-kind heart and brain formula designed exclusively for Infowars Life.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:20.505]  The main ingredient in the Real Red Pill Plus is Pregnanolone, a little-known neurosteroid that assists in our body's natural hormone production.
[00:43:20.785 --> 00:43:26.828]  And low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.
[00:43:26.828 --> 00:43:34.713]  The Real Red Pill Plus also provides essential trace minerals such as vitamin B12, calcium, and zinc.
[00:43:34.713 --> 00:43:47.820]  Featuring naturally occurring L-theanine, caffeine, and theobromine, the energy blend inside the Real Red Pill Plus provides an extra pick-me-up for your day that goes beyond the second cup of coffee.

[00:46:00.531 --> 00:46:04.112]  So, when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically, I was 275 pounds.
[00:46:04.112 --> 00:46:05.513]  I was overweight.
[00:46:05.513 --> 00:46:07.594]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[00:46:07.874 --> 00:46:12.280]  I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Grip on your show, and I listened to it.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:16.845]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[00:46:16.845 --> 00:46:22.913]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with X2, you know, with a deeper source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[00:46:22.913 --> 00:46:23.754]  And man, in two
[00:46:23.814 --> 00:46:24.174]  We're good.
[00:46:44.574 --> 00:46:49.319]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:20.405]  Welcome back my friends.
[00:47:20.405 --> 00:47:22.306]  I want to say something about nuclear war here.
[00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:24.768]  Then I'm going to finish up with the medical news and get back into that.
[00:47:24.768 --> 00:47:33.816]  Then get into the global economy being imploded by design with a real expert who's got the numbers and the facts been proven right.
[00:47:33.816 --> 00:47:35.057]  I am not a fearful person.
[00:47:35.057 --> 00:47:38.480]  I'm a person who likes to be prepared, likes to face things down.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.562]  And earlier at the start of the next segment,
[00:47:42.335 --> 00:47:45.820]  I remember when I was about 16, the first time I had an anxiety attack.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.464]  I probably only had 10 of them in my life.
[00:47:48.464 --> 00:47:52.249]  And you feel like you can't breathe and everything's crazy and you're sick.
[00:47:52.249 --> 00:47:52.850]  Something's wrong.
[00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:55.494]  I remember the first time I'd had like four or five cups of coffee.
[00:47:56.581 --> 00:48:02.525]  When I was a teacher's aide when I was 17, in the first period, I just drank too much coffee that day.
[00:48:02.525 --> 00:48:13.192]  I got up at like 4 a.m., jogged, lifted weights, ate breakfast, done some of my homework that was late, got to school at like 8 in the morning, drank more coffee, and I had an anxiety attack from too much coffee.
[00:48:13.192 --> 00:48:15.254]  My mom said, hey, how many cups of coffee you had?
[00:48:15.254 --> 00:48:15.994]  I said, I had five.
[00:48:15.994 --> 00:48:16.775]  She said, you can't do that.
[00:48:17.478 --> 00:48:24.204]  Next time I went to a cafeteria that was all you could eat, drank about six glasses of iced tea, had an anxiety attack.
[00:48:24.204 --> 00:48:26.846]  So I learned not to get too much caffeine or I could have that.
[00:48:26.846 --> 00:48:28.448]  I never really had any since then.
[00:48:28.448 --> 00:48:31.530]  And now I only have about one cup of coffee a day or so.
[00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:36.895]  But lately with this nuclear war stuff, I have been having anxiety attacks.
[00:48:36.895 --> 00:48:40.919]  And I started having one at the start of the last segment when I looked at the news and was about to cover it.
[00:48:40.919 --> 00:48:42.340]  I just couldn't do it.
[00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:43.161]  Because I have children.
[00:48:44.449 --> 00:48:46.550]  And I'm pissed off.
[00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:48.511]  And there's a really good chance we're all going to die.
[00:48:48.511 --> 00:48:51.053]  And I'm tired of this.
[00:48:51.053 --> 00:48:52.573]  And I'm sick of the New World Order.
[00:48:52.573 --> 00:48:54.614]  And I'm sick of the criminals that run Washington.
[00:48:54.614 --> 00:49:01.758]  And I tell you, it's because I'm not turning this desk over.
[00:49:01.758 --> 00:49:03.899]  I'm not smashing stuff.
[00:49:03.899 --> 00:49:06.380]  Because that's what I really feel like doing.
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:07.161]  But instead of doing that,
[00:49:08.353 --> 00:49:14.177]  We need to take a deep breath and just pray to God to cause a global awakening, which is starting to happen, and that we just have peace.
[00:49:14.177 --> 00:49:25.465]  And I know things aren't going to be perfect, and we know what Revelation looks like, and they had a big poll out this week, I didn't get to it yesterday, where upwards of half of Americans think we're in the end times.
[00:49:25.465 --> 00:49:35.311]  Well, Nineveh was about to be destroyed, but God sent Jonah, and Nineveh was given a hundred year reprieve because they repented.
[00:49:35.311 --> 00:49:35.752]  And so,
[00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:46.573]  God has ordained, God has set things up that are going to happen, but God also lets us choose our own adventure.
[00:49:46.573 --> 00:49:53.675]  You know those little books for teenagers where they have three or four different endings and you choose your adventure by what page you turn to?
[00:49:53.675 --> 00:50:01.218]  And so it's set what's going to happen, studying history, but it's also up to our will and what we do, God gives us options.
[00:50:02.276 --> 00:50:19.524]  And I can tell you at a gut level, a spiritual level, not just an intellectual level, not just a military level, but at a gut level, I can tell you this situation with Russia, and I don't think you need me to tell you this, is very dangerous and is kicking towards thermonuclear Armageddon.
[00:50:19.524 --> 00:50:24.526]  And God said next time he'd destroy much of the earth, not with water, but with fire.
[00:50:24.526 --> 00:50:25.387]  And so that's where we are.
[00:50:34.241 --> 00:50:39.142]  It's what you expect to happen when they have drag queen story time at the White House.
[00:50:39.142 --> 00:50:46.804]  That's a nice Sodom and Gomorrah signpost, or like a light on the oven telling you that, you know, the turkey's done.
[00:50:46.804 --> 00:50:58.206]  And of course, the drag queen people that were at the White House are on record, there's an article on Infowars.com, I'm not going to quote it here on air, talking about sex with children.
[00:50:58.206 --> 00:51:00.027]  Of course.
[00:51:00.027 --> 00:51:01.187]  That's what goes on at the White House.
[00:51:02.984 --> 00:51:08.727]  And you got mass smuggling going on by Biden, and now he's completely dissolving the border, getting rid of Title 42.
[00:51:08.727 --> 00:51:10.588]  We are a cursed nation.
[00:51:10.588 --> 00:51:11.488]  Let's just admit it.
[00:51:11.488 --> 00:51:18.772]  We turned away from God, and look where we are now.
[00:51:18.772 --> 00:51:22.674]  So, it's a bunch of maniacs that want our children.
[00:51:22.674 --> 00:51:25.996]  Now, I said I'd get to this first, so let's play these clips.
[00:51:25.996 --> 00:51:27.917]  One is the Santas.
[00:51:27.917 --> 00:51:29.198]  One is a leading British MP.
[00:51:30.538 --> 00:51:39.980]  And then another we need to get to is also very, very critical to break down, and that's Dr. Peter McCullough.
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:42.600]  So let's just play clip 15, 5, and 7 back to back.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.900]  Here they are.
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:51.182]  A group based out of the UK, but represents 70 grassroots organizations all over the world.
[00:51:51.182 --> 00:51:54.002]  Dr. Malhotra is one of the leaders of this group.
[00:51:54.002 --> 00:51:59.503]  The World Council for Health on June 11, 2022 issued a pharmacovigilance report.
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:08.406]  They analyzed all the vaccines, 39 safety systems, four big ones in the world, and they're all consistent.
[00:52:08.406 --> 00:52:13.590]  There is an alarming signal of excess death after taking the vaccine.
[00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:15.512]  An alarming signal.
[00:52:15.512 --> 00:52:21.677]  Looking backwards, these vaccines should have come off the market in early January of 2021 for excess mortality.
[00:52:21.677 --> 00:52:26.301]  People dying early after the vaccines, now dying late after the vaccines.
[00:52:27.236 --> 00:52:29.597]  And this report is comprehensive.
[00:52:29.597 --> 00:52:31.758]  It's about 20 pages long.
[00:52:31.758 --> 00:52:36.741]  And I encourage anybody to say, listen, show me some evidence that the vaccines are harmful.
[00:52:36.741 --> 00:52:38.562]  You know, don't do it on your own.
[00:52:38.562 --> 00:52:40.023]  Just go to the World Council for Health.
[00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:43.825]  This is a wonderful synthesis because it's all over the world.
[00:52:43.825 --> 00:52:55.591]  And I can tell you, in total, many tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, and potentially millions of people have lost their lives with the vaccine.
[00:52:57.145 --> 00:53:05.913]  This will go down as the biggest biological pharmaceutical safety disaster in the history of mankind.
[00:53:05.913 --> 00:53:07.274]  By a mile.
[00:53:07.274 --> 00:53:11.819]  This will go down worse than most wars in terms of mortality.
[00:53:12.979 --> 00:53:25.670]  Part of this issue and other issues with COVID goes back to an attempt to enforce one acceptable narrative on all these issues.
[00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:30.755]  You saw it with the censorship of Dr. Bhattacharya.
[00:53:31.275 --> 00:53:32.316]  Uh, with Twitter.
[00:53:32.316 --> 00:53:41.726]  You also saw it with Dr. Fauci and some of these people saying that they needed to go after these people who wrote the Great Barrington Declaration.
[00:53:41.726 --> 00:53:45.289]  They wanted to not contest the ideas in that.
[00:53:45.289 --> 00:53:47.672]  They basically wanted to smear them.
[00:53:48.592 --> 00:53:53.254]  Because they didn't want to have any criticism of their lockdown policies.
[00:53:53.254 --> 00:54:09.539]  And so part of the reason I think it's been a bad response is because from the very beginning you had a lot of arrogance that it's our way or the highway and anyone that offers any type of a dissenting opinion and they were censoring from day one.
[00:54:09.539 --> 00:54:16.702]  People that would write anti-lockdown things in March of 2020, April 2020, some of those would get taken down.
[00:54:17.022 --> 00:54:17.342]  I think?
[00:54:36.773 --> 00:54:37.114]  I don't know.
[00:54:57.376 --> 00:54:57.677]  I don't know.
[00:55:13.172 --> 00:55:28.483]  Everything that was going on in Twitter is going on in these others if not even more so and we got a sense of that when they went after us for for having the Opposing the masks having the experts oppose the masks for these young kids.
[00:55:28.483 --> 00:55:40.432]  That's right huge organized government corporate combines censoring persecuting Attacking and calling for our arrest when we question things remember and wanting to arrest anti-vaxxers and all the rest of it so dr.
[00:55:42.628 --> 00:55:44.049]  McCullough exposed what's going on.
[00:55:44.049 --> 00:55:46.270]  Governor DeSantis exposed what goes on.
[00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:52.454]  The Member of Parliament in the UK, Andrew Bridgen, also has been talking about what whistleblowers are telling him.
[00:55:52.454 --> 00:55:53.895]  But we've known this for years and years.
[00:55:53.895 --> 00:55:57.077]  You heard the key that DeSantis laid out there.
[00:55:57.077 --> 00:56:04.161]  He said day one they were suppressing everybody because they knew what they were doing.
[00:56:04.161 --> 00:56:07.023]  And that's why this is life and death.
[00:56:07.023 --> 00:56:10.325]  We're going to be in a permanent biomedical tyranny where they kill us with shots,
[00:56:11.823 --> 00:56:11.903]  It's
[00:56:26.869 --> 00:56:27.409]  I recognize you.
[00:56:27.409 --> 00:56:28.289]  You're the head of the major bank.
[00:56:28.289 --> 00:56:28.770]  Yeah.
[00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:29.690]  Is this off record, Alex?
[00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:30.770]  I'll tell you.
[00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:33.331]  And he just said, they're going to adapt to being slaves.
[00:56:33.331 --> 00:56:34.071]  You don't get it.
[00:56:34.071 --> 00:56:36.232]  You think they're going to adapt and overcome like you do?
[00:56:36.232 --> 00:56:37.072]  No.
[00:56:37.072 --> 00:56:39.693]  You should join us because you, you, you overcome.
[00:56:39.693 --> 00:56:40.833]  They don't overcome.
[00:56:40.833 --> 00:56:42.754]  They're going to submit to whatever we do.
[00:56:42.754 --> 00:56:44.694]  Well, no, we're not.
[00:56:44.694 --> 00:56:45.514]  No, we're not.
[00:56:45.514 --> 00:56:48.615]  And I'm not signing on to mass murder.
[00:56:48.615 --> 00:56:51.336]  As if anybody's going to be safe in this future system with you people.
[00:56:52.458 --> 00:57:00.470]  So we'll end the clip with a Member of Parliament and then start the second hour with our special guest that you, believe me, do not want to miss what's coming up in the next hour.
[00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:01.953]  Go ahead and play this clip.
[00:57:03.496 --> 00:57:17.788]  Madam Deputy Speaker, it's also been brought to my attention by a whistleblower, from a very reliable source, that one of these institutions is covering up clear data that reveals the mRNA vaccine increases inflammation of the heart arteries.
[00:57:17.788 --> 00:57:22.432]  They are covering this up in fear that they may lose funding from the pharmaceutical industry
[00:57:23.072 --> 00:57:41.676]  The leader of that cardiology research department has a prominent leadership role with the British Heart Foundation and I'm very disappointed to say that he has sent out non-disclosure agreements to his research team to ensure that this important data never sees the light of day.
[00:57:41.676 --> 00:57:44.597]  This, Madam Speaker, is an absolute disgrace.
[00:57:50.307 --> 00:57:53.349]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered.
[00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:55.451]  And InfoWars has been the tip of spear against tyranny.
[00:57:55.451 --> 00:58:01.536]  And when it comes to products we sell to fund our operation, they're just like our news and information.
[00:58:01.536 --> 00:58:03.758]  They are powerful and they change the world.
[00:58:04.431 --> 00:58:10.295]  The Real Red Pill Plus is one of our top sellers, but for over two years, it's been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns.
[00:58:10.295 --> 00:58:13.016]  It's finally back in stock.

[00:58:50.873 --> 00:58:57.734]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:00.591]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[00:59:00.591 --> 00:59:02.291]  They know we're telling the truth.
[00:59:02.291 --> 00:59:03.852]  They know we've got their number.
[00:59:03.852 --> 00:59:08.593]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[00:59:08.593 --> 00:59:16.456]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[00:59:16.456 --> 00:59:26.859]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds like preglanone and so much more to supercharge your body.
[00:59:27.864 --> 00:59:28.164]  Thank you.
[00:59:53.132 --> 00:59:57.060]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:08.163 --> 01:00:15.433]  By opening the floodgates to unfettered free speech, Elon Musk has allowed hate to spread far and fast on Twitter.
[01:00:15.433 --> 01:00:26.067]  While the left winds out another distraction about Matt Taibbi catering to the richest man in the world, what do the Twitter files reveal about the inner workings
[01:00:26.067 --> 01:00:31.451]  Twitter was acting as a wrecking ball of political tech censorship catering to the corrupt Washington establishment
[01:00:55.347 --> 01:01:08.590]  Directly impacting and propagandizing a digital town square which affected the general welfare of the United States, whose lifeblood is protected by the power and freedom of the First Amendment.
[01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:21.492]  And if it turns out there are a lot of us on this list, where the DNC targeted us, and I will quote the immortal words of Joseph Welch when he attacked Joe McCarthy for the enemies list he had,
[01:01:22.356 --> 01:01:26.460]  At long last, sir, have you no shame?
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:26.760]  Yes.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.723]  President Biden, all of your
[01:01:31.304 --> 01:01:34.446]  Taibbi points out that both parties had access to these tools.
[01:01:34.446 --> 01:01:42.792]  For instance, in 2020, requests from both the Trump White House and the Biden campaign were received and honored.
[01:01:56.801 --> 01:02:05.388]  But the overwhelming amount of leftist Marxist cucks staffed at Twitter ensured that Democrat Party requests took the front burner.
[01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:13.774]  A fact backed up by the overall donations by Twitter to the Democrat Party reaching 99.73% or $165,969 to Democrats while $451 went to Republicans in 2022.
[01:02:23.682 --> 01:02:25.943]  Are you worried about these Twitter files coming out?
[01:02:25.943 --> 01:02:33.666]  What was that experience like having Kellyanne, who's always in control of herself, siccing this MAGA trolls on you?
[01:02:33.666 --> 01:02:34.646]  It's terrifying.
[01:02:34.646 --> 01:02:44.350]  When you get targeted in some of these ways, it's hard to differentiate between what is somebody just online trying to rattle you and what's a real threat.
[01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:53.337]  You see in things like Pizzagate that online conspiracies can mobilize very real and very direct offline violence.
[01:02:53.337 --> 01:03:04.426]  I saw those harms, I experienced those harms, and now it was those harms through a mainstream news outlet being held up in the Oval Office by the former President of the United States, and that is
[01:03:05.106 --> 01:03:07.507]  Well, we know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin.
[01:03:07.507 --> 01:03:13.570]  That's been clear for well over a year now that they've been pushing this false narrative about the Vice President and his son.
[01:03:34.079 --> 01:03:40.164]  According to internal emails, there was zero evidence of foreign interference occurring.
[01:03:40.164 --> 01:03:54.377]  What did occur was a meltdown of internal Twitter censorship spearheaded by top Twitter management, with the result of ultimately burying a critical story under false pretenses in order to sway popular opinion
[01:03:54.557 --> 01:03:54.897]  We're good.
[01:04:20.842 --> 01:04:33.004]  Not only have Twitter employees like head of legal policy and trust Vijaya Gadi and trust in safety chief Yoel Roth proven that they willingly altered the 2020 U.S.
[01:04:33.004 --> 01:04:46.987]  presidential election, but they have demonstrated that Silicon Valley, the Mockingbird media, and the corruption in Washington is an occupying force and a direct threat to the stability and the future of the United States of America.
[01:04:47.287 --> 01:04:49.953]  This cyber insurrection is what I'm calling it.
[01:04:49.953 --> 01:04:55.745]  It's an assault on this country and it's borderline treason if you think about what the executives did at Twitter.
[01:04:59.901 --> 01:05:11.146]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:05:11.146 --> 01:05:13.047]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:05:13.047 --> 01:05:14.508]  That's what they want to take away.
[01:05:14.508 --> 01:05:15.869]  Your ability to speak freely.
[01:05:15.869 --> 01:05:17.730]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:19.010]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:20.391]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[01:05:20.831 --> 01:05:25.675]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[01:05:25.675 --> 01:05:28.057]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:30.079]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[01:05:30.079 --> 01:05:37.025]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalists' agenda.
[01:05:37.665 --> 01:05:43.047]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[01:05:43.047 --> 01:05:51.990]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsTore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:54.331]  1776 is the promo code.
[01:05:54.331 --> 01:06:01.013]  The destination is InfoWarsTore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[01:06:01.013 --> 01:06:04.394]  The front lines of the information war.
[01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:05.815]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:12.759 --> 01:06:14.901]  Headlines on InfoWars.com.
[01:06:14.901 --> 01:06:15.642]  Update.
[01:06:15.642 --> 01:06:23.269]  New Zealand government steals baby from parents after they demand unvaccinated blood for heart surgery.
[01:06:23.269 --> 01:06:30.555]  And now they're putting a guardian over the baby, but they've still got the little sweetie pie right there that we can see on screen.
[01:06:30.555 --> 01:06:36.100]  I want to first go to a short newscast with the update and then go to them joining us in the middle of the night in New Zealand.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:36.421]  Here it is.
[01:06:37.022 --> 01:06:44.228]  A decision has been made in this case of the four-month-old baby and whether guardianship will be put into the court.
[01:06:44.228 --> 01:06:53.477]  The judge has ruled for guardianship of this four-month-old baby to be placed into the court so that its heart surgery can proceed as soon as possible.
[01:06:53.477 --> 01:07:00.283]  Now this is only a temporary guardianship of the court for this child, a set period of time.
[01:07:00.643 --> 01:07:02.624]  Until the 31st of January.
[01:07:02.624 --> 01:07:09.726]  Now the court will appoint two doctors as its agents for the purpose of consenting to this child's surgery.
[01:07:09.726 --> 01:07:14.968]  All decisions relating to surgery including the blood products that are used.
[01:07:14.968 --> 01:07:24.392]  Now these medical agents will have to keep the child's parents informed and remember that the parents remain the agents of all other decisions for this child.
[01:07:24.392 --> 01:07:25.372]  Now lawyers in the court
[01:07:25.692 --> 01:07:27.313]  Alice, can the family appeal this decision?
[01:07:51.229 --> 01:07:53.571]  Yes, Mike, they do have the right to.
[01:07:53.571 --> 01:07:58.834]  At this stage, we don't have any indication as it's just come out as to whether that will happen.
[01:07:58.834 --> 01:08:04.137]  However, regardless, this order still has effect until any appeal can be heard.
[01:08:04.137 --> 01:08:07.960]  So lawyers for the family would need to also apply for a stay.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:15.681]  Alex, we're going to come back to you later with some more reaction to this, but just repeating that breaking news that a gravely ill baby has been put into guardianship by the Auckland High Court.
[01:08:15.681 --> 01:08:17.022]  More on this throughout the Bulletin.
[01:08:38.027 --> 01:08:49.993]  So, this is all about the state, it's the same worldwide you indirected, taking control of your bodies, and now saying we're going to put blood product to people that have a growing prion, or spike protein, in your body.
[01:08:49.993 --> 01:08:58.057]  We have all the medical reports, the governor of Florida has criminal investigations going, and Big Pharma lying about this, but they're still doubling down.
[01:08:58.057 --> 01:09:02.379]  Samantha Savage and Cole Reeves, join us, savebabywill.com.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:09.687]  Donations needed at buymeacoffee.com forward slash savebabywill.
[01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:11.749]  We'll put all that on screen for you.
[01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:13.911]  They're up the middle of the night in New Zealand.
[01:09:13.911 --> 01:09:24.162]  We also have the reporters going to be joining us who first broke this travesty so the world would know about this attack on parents on bodily autonomy by these
[01:09:25.063 --> 01:09:27.365]  Joseph Mingala-esque mad scientist.
[01:09:27.365 --> 01:09:31.268]  So Cole Reeves and Samantha Savage, thank you for joining us.
[01:09:31.268 --> 01:09:40.656]  Tell us what this has been like and lay out what's happened so far and then the latest news about the supposed guardianship of these doctors taking over.
[01:09:44.676 --> 01:09:47.338]  Thank you for having us.
[01:09:47.338 --> 01:09:49.019]  Yeah, I mean it's horrendous.
[01:09:49.019 --> 01:10:02.448]  It's horrendous what's happening and what's happened and what our baby is facing and we're feeling pretty upset by it all as you can imagine.
[01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:06.171]  Yeah, we're just sort of putting one foot in front of the next now.
[01:10:08.044 --> 01:10:11.005]  Yeah, thanks Alex for having us on.
[01:10:11.005 --> 01:10:20.406]  It's a great honour to be able to tell the world what's going on here in this country because it's very criminal.
[01:10:20.406 --> 01:10:35.269]  We're sort of flabbergasted that the legal systems got down to this where they're essentially medically kidnapping our baby and then they're going to perform a medical experiment on him which is now proven
[01:10:36.351 --> 01:10:49.760]  To be a medical experiment, because it's been proven in the court the other day, and all the parties agree, that this blood product that they're offering has got some serious problems.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:11:02.189]  I mean, that was a fact that was brought out in the court and agreed to by the judge and by everyone, so we're just wondering how you can sort of justify going ahead with an operation when you know that there's a problem.
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.100]  Wow.
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:07.241]  You know, the news always condenses it down, only shows one side.
[01:11:07.241 --> 01:11:08.702]  Tell us the timeline here.
[01:11:08.702 --> 01:11:13.443]  When this began, when it became a story?
[01:11:13.443 --> 01:11:17.265]  Well, it began, I suppose, at his birth.
[01:11:17.265 --> 01:11:27.448]  And then, because we are people that haven't decided to take the injection, there was always a lot of fear around us.
[01:11:27.448 --> 01:11:32.750]  So, you know, in subsequent baby scans and things in Sam's tummy,
[01:11:34.618 --> 01:11:43.266]  All of what should have been picked up was missed through people, you know, being terribly afraid of us because we're not vaccinated.
[01:11:43.266 --> 01:11:53.936]  So, you know, what should have been a problem that could have been addressed a long time ago was only picked up not that long ago and now it's just blown out into all of this.
[01:11:53.936 --> 01:11:59.561]  Yeah, so basically we've been told that this sort of condition for Will
[01:12:00.642 --> 01:12:06.785]  It's something that is often picked up in the antenatal scans.
[01:12:06.785 --> 01:12:16.690]  So I had the antenatal scan and it should have taken two hours and it only took an hour because she was just trying to rush it through.
[01:12:16.690 --> 01:12:26.555]  And then, you know, there's been two ECHOs that have been done once he was born that also missed it and the third ECHO is the one that actually found the problem.
[01:12:27.247 --> 01:12:27.307]  Yes.
[01:12:44.981 --> 01:12:47.244]  What was happening with him wasn't right.
[01:12:47.244 --> 01:12:48.706]  There was something going on.
[01:12:48.706 --> 01:12:56.236]  And you know, I pushed the nurses and the people that were coming to our home just to try and figure out what actually was going on.
[01:12:56.236 --> 01:12:59.380]  And finally, we found out that it was to do with his heart.
[01:13:00.194 --> 01:13:17.169]  So you with Mother's Intuition said he was sick, it was proven he was sick, and now your research and common science and experimental injections and a huge international scandal that blood banks say people don't want blood that's been contaminated, they mix the blood together.
[01:13:17.169 --> 01:13:18.571]  We've had huge scandals with Bayer.
[01:13:19.291 --> 01:13:22.312]  Knowingly shipping out millions of doses of a blood product.
[01:13:22.312 --> 01:13:24.794]  They knew had HIV and hepatitis in it.
[01:13:24.794 --> 01:13:26.134]  That famous scandal.
[01:13:26.134 --> 01:13:27.375]  And so this is a big scandal.
[01:13:27.375 --> 01:13:35.898]  This is a legitimate thing that you're saying that you know there should be a blood banks now that are been given the experimental shots and those that don't.
[01:13:35.898 --> 01:13:44.162]  So what you're saying I think is being attacked and shut down because it makes so much sense and it's so legitimate and they don't want any precedent for this.
[01:13:45.987 --> 01:13:47.388]  Yeah, totally.
[01:13:47.388 --> 01:13:48.710]  That's exactly right.
[01:13:48.710 --> 01:13:53.434]  And you know, we've been painted in the media as something that we're not.
[01:13:53.434 --> 01:13:58.198]  You know, we're loving parents that want actually the very, very, very best for our baby.
[01:13:58.198 --> 01:14:00.620]  We know he needs heart surgery.
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:05.605]  We've been pleading with the whole medical team here to do it.
[01:14:05.605 --> 01:14:07.307]  But please, we don't want
[01:14:08.467 --> 01:14:12.109]  We don't want that.
[01:14:12.109 --> 01:14:15.471]  We know that that is, you know, he's got a compromised heart.
[01:14:15.471 --> 01:14:21.555]  We don't want to put something in that could be cardiotoxic to his heart.
[01:14:21.555 --> 01:14:30.099]  Which by the way, as you know, it's now admitted all over the world, governments admit, the CDC admits here in America, that it does attack young people's hearts.
[01:14:30.099 --> 01:14:31.080]  There's no doubt about that.
[01:14:32.458 --> 01:14:35.981]  And especially males, and he's male.
[01:14:35.981 --> 01:14:40.685]  And he's already got an existing heart condition, you know, that is quite rare.
[01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:55.538]  And then they're, it's just incredible, but they're arrogantly saying we aren't going to bother looking for anything in the blood because we deem that the blood people are telling us it's safe, so we won't even look into it.
[01:14:55.538 --> 01:14:55.798]  Wow.
[01:14:57.128 --> 01:14:59.651]  Wow, they have really bitten off more than they could chew.
[01:14:59.651 --> 01:15:04.256]  I want to go to break and give you guys the floor and bring in the reporter, Liz Gunn, that broke this anytime.
[01:15:04.256 --> 01:15:07.119]  She wants to pop in, but there's so many facets to this.
[01:15:07.119 --> 01:15:12.665]  I just want to say as we go to break, I want to thank you for standing up for my rights, because this is all a global run thing.
[01:15:12.665 --> 01:15:15.328]  So Australia is America, Canada is Germany.
[01:15:15.928 --> 01:15:19.030]  South Africa is New Zealand.
[01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:35.482]  I mean we're all facing the same big corporate biomedical takeover and we're all going to be faced with this and so you guys are like the icebreakers just because of the time and you know where God put you to be on the front lines saying no and I want to thank you for myself and my family for standing up for all our rights.

[01:15:49.334 --> 01:15:51.576]  These monsters want full control of our lives.
[01:15:51.576 --> 01:15:53.919]  They're targeting our children with these poison shots.
[01:15:53.919 --> 01:15:55.200]  Now they want to put poison blood in them.

[01:16:06.224 --> 01:16:12.109]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:18.455]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:26.002]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[01:16:26.002 --> 01:16:36.313]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[01:16:36.693 --> 01:16:45.718]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[01:16:45.718 --> 01:16:52.302]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[01:16:52.302 --> 01:16:58.805]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.

[01:18:03.681 --> 01:18:07.386]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[01:18:07.386 --> 01:18:18.218]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with, the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.

[01:18:35.791 --> 01:18:39.213]  I'd take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[01:18:39.213 --> 01:18:40.734]  Don't do it during the day.
[01:18:40.734 --> 01:18:43.756]  1776 testosterone boost.

[01:19:59.475 --> 01:20:05.379]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:17.521 --> 01:20:18.003]  I think?
[01:20:29.611 --> 01:20:34.414]  Cole Reeves, our little baby Will's parents.
[01:20:34.414 --> 01:20:39.736]  And there's a lot of background here that I want to get into about your career and what you've witnessed, Samantha.
[01:20:39.736 --> 01:20:41.137]  Let's let you see what's going on.
[01:20:41.137 --> 01:20:49.241]  I see the reports that are even in major studies now that breastfeeding women that have taken the shot, the babies are getting really sick from the spike protein.
[01:20:49.241 --> 01:20:54.184]  This is not debatable now that it's infected the blood supply, that it keeps replicating in the bodies.
[01:20:54.184 --> 01:20:57.666]  This is a very legitimate concern with the horrible history
[01:20:58.723 --> 01:21:05.104]  Not just here in the US, but New Zealand, particularly with the Bayer scandal was one of the worst hit along with France.
[01:21:05.104 --> 01:21:06.245]  It's just outrageous.
[01:21:06.245 --> 01:21:08.305]  They're doing this and Cole Reeves.
[01:21:08.305 --> 01:21:23.209]  I want you to be able to just to get out all the incredible points here that the world needs to know and the timeline here of them trying to force this blood product on the baby.
[01:21:23.209 --> 01:21:24.169]  Yeah, thanks Alex.
[01:21:24.169 --> 01:21:24.649]  Will we?
[01:21:25.703 --> 01:21:40.187]  We have been in and out of the system for a little while now and just with the baby's condition and there was a procedure that was performed and I won't go into any of that because it didn't work.
[01:21:40.187 --> 01:21:53.230]  And so right there and then we just said no, we have to supply the very best for our child that we can possibly supply which is we know that this next procedure that they told us about is going to need to have
[01:21:54.005 --> 01:21:55.286]  You know, blood products.
[01:21:55.286 --> 01:21:57.427]  And so, you know, we're on to it, people.
[01:21:57.427 --> 01:22:02.050]  And we decided to, you know, find a way.
[01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:05.231]  And I mean, it seemed simple to begin with.
[01:22:05.231 --> 01:22:11.415]  Find a way to get blood, you know, donated by our donors that we all found.
[01:22:11.415 --> 01:22:12.736]  We found donors.
[01:22:12.736 --> 01:22:13.356]  Sam did.
[01:22:13.356 --> 01:22:14.517]  Sam found them.
[01:22:14.517 --> 01:22:18.799]  She's an incredible lady that's just, you know, over the top.
[01:22:18.799 --> 01:22:19.900]  Well, we found these donors.
[01:22:21.154 --> 01:22:32.122]  We thought that would be a really easy procedure because in the blood website it had, we do direct donor blood services for, you know, if you need that.
[01:22:32.122 --> 01:22:38.847]  And so we got the donors ready and then it seemed like it was the doctor can sign a piece of paper and
[01:22:40.606 --> 01:22:42.507]  You get the service.
[01:22:42.507 --> 01:22:43.828]  By the way, I didn't know this.
[01:22:43.828 --> 01:22:45.148]  I was going to ask you this question.
[01:22:45.148 --> 01:23:03.098]  I know a lot of people got concerned about tainted blood with all the problems of so many even famous people getting bad blood and dying of HIV or hepatitis or other things that a lot of people will go out and find friends or family that have the same blood type or a comparable donor and then they will give blood so you have fresh good blood for the procedure.
[01:23:03.098 --> 01:23:06.000]  You had that, but still they said no.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.321]  Wow, this is just raw power grab.
[01:23:10.299 --> 01:23:13.715]  Well it is, and it all boils down to will...
[01:23:14.377 --> 01:23:35.817]  He can't have his parents make a decision for him, so the state has just said, no, we're not going to even listen to you, we're not going to listen to your concerns, we're not going to do anything, we're going to just take control and we're going to force this product into this baby and we're not even going to test for it because we don't think there's a problem.
[01:23:35.817 --> 01:23:40.161]  There is a clear problem here and it's not just the blood, it's actually the state
[01:23:40.681 --> 01:23:41.122]  We're good to go.
[01:23:59.185 --> 01:24:05.352]  Hey, so we've had to make the stand because there's hundreds of thousands of people in this country that didn't want to take the injection.
[01:24:05.352 --> 01:24:16.364]  There's millions around the world and hey, all of those people right now are having to be forced, if they need a blood transfusion, they're going to have to be forced to take whatever blood there's, you know, put into them.
[01:24:17.662 --> 01:24:25.327]  That's right, there's already a huge global debate about the tainted blood supply, and the Clintons being involved, knowing they were putting HIV in with a big company in Canada.
[01:24:25.327 --> 01:24:26.608]  It's just so sick.
[01:24:26.608 --> 01:24:34.573]  Samantha, I'm told that Will was not alone when you gave birth, that he's a twin who's fine.
[01:24:34.573 --> 01:24:40.017]  Thank God he doesn't have a heart issue, and that you're also a midwife, so you've seen a lot of this up front.
[01:24:40.017 --> 01:24:41.298]  Tell us about those experiences.
[01:24:43.641 --> 01:25:06.153]  Yeah well I mean I was mandated so when that came in I was escorted out of the hospital I was working in by security through the mandate and I suppose our governing body as midwives has been very
[01:25:08.413 --> 01:25:19.264]  Very vocal on their opinions around the vaccination and you know they've tried to sort of keep a lot of midwives quiet.
[01:25:19.264 --> 01:25:22.187]  Wow, so they're kicking you out of your job, they're coming for your baby.
[01:25:22.187 --> 01:25:28.153]  I mean this, just like Cole said, there's not much more rights to take after this.
[01:25:28.153 --> 01:25:28.193]  No.
[01:25:30.495 --> 01:25:36.777]  Yeah, the hospital has, and the government, has railroaded us as parents.
[01:25:36.777 --> 01:25:42.440]  They've tried to silence the parental voice, which is all wrong.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:47.101]  You know, we're loving parents and we've never once said we don't want the operation.
[01:25:47.101 --> 01:25:48.142]  We wanted it.
[01:25:48.142 --> 01:25:48.782]  We want it.
[01:25:49.202 --> 01:25:49.262]  Wow.
[01:26:08.493 --> 01:26:13.116]  Well, you guys look great for being up in the middle of the night in New Zealand and having twins.
[01:26:13.116 --> 01:26:14.757]  We should all be praying for you as well.
[01:26:14.757 --> 01:26:17.279]  You know, God's the ultimate arbiter here in my view.
[01:26:17.279 --> 01:26:23.643]  But, wow, just incredible.
[01:26:23.643 --> 01:26:26.145]  Yeah, well, you know, it is incredible.
[01:26:26.145 --> 01:26:33.670]  And like I said before, we're a little bit flabbergasted at the whole procedure.
[01:26:33.670 --> 01:26:36.432]  It's just completely possible to make this happen.
[01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:40.231]  And we just can't understand why they're not making it happen.
[01:26:40.231 --> 01:26:46.014]  So we've had meetings, and they just said, no, we can make it happen, but we're just not going to.
[01:26:46.014 --> 01:26:50.816]  There's no way we're going to do it for you.
[01:26:50.816 --> 01:27:00.681]  In a decent society, doesn't the entire society rally around to make things happen, to make a baby well?
[01:27:00.681 --> 01:27:03.522]  Well, they want to do horrible, out-in-the-open evil things.
[01:27:04.847 --> 01:27:06.128]  Yeah, well it's, you know...
[01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:26.692]  So our stance is we're never going to be comfortable with this.
[01:27:26.692 --> 01:27:33.134]  Never be comfortable with medical experimentation on a kid with unknown substances.
[01:27:33.134 --> 01:27:34.234]  Wow.
[01:27:34.234 --> 01:27:35.234]  We've got about a minute and a half to break.
[01:27:35.234 --> 01:27:38.335]  We'll come back with more and the journals that help you guys break this.
[01:27:38.335 --> 01:27:40.396]  But what is the timeline?
[01:27:40.396 --> 01:27:41.576]  Or you don't know.
[01:27:41.576 --> 01:27:43.937]  He obviously needs the surgery.
[01:27:43.937 --> 01:27:46.778]  They won't let you get a donor that's safe and healthy.
[01:27:46.778 --> 01:27:47.518]  What do you do?
[01:27:47.518 --> 01:27:48.278]  What's the timeline?
[01:27:48.278 --> 01:27:50.079]  Are they going to try to take him if you don't do it?
[01:27:50.079 --> 01:27:50.679]  Or what's going to happen?
[01:27:51.795 --> 01:27:55.517]  Yeah, so they're meant to be doing surgery probably on Friday.
[01:27:55.517 --> 01:27:57.038]  Today is Thursday, so tomorrow.
[01:27:57.038 --> 01:27:57.959]  Wow.
[01:27:57.959 --> 01:28:02.742]  And they've put security guards on the ward.
[01:28:02.742 --> 01:28:05.924]  They're telling me I'm not allowed to take him out.
[01:28:05.924 --> 01:28:13.909]  They said if I do, they will enforce police or Oranga Tamariki on me.
[01:28:13.909 --> 01:28:18.492]  So it's just disgusting, you know, trying to make us prisoners in a hospital.
[01:28:19.719 --> 01:28:27.642]  Yeah, so Sam is medically imprisoned right now and so is the baby, even though the court documents say otherwise.
[01:28:27.642 --> 01:28:33.624]  So they've come in last night and threatened us and we had to exit them from the room that we're imprisoned in.
[01:28:33.624 --> 01:28:41.927]  Yeah, there's just lies surrounding the entire government case and only the truth surrounding our case.
[01:28:41.927 --> 01:28:44.148]  So you're basically locked up right now in the facility?
[01:28:46.878 --> 01:28:47.839]  Wow!
[01:28:47.839 --> 01:28:49.059]  Whoa!
[01:28:49.059 --> 01:28:52.260]  Okay, this just gets crazier by the minute.
[01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:53.801]  It just always gets worse, folks.
[01:28:53.801 --> 01:28:56.362]  It doesn't get better until it gets better.
[01:28:56.362 --> 01:28:58.483]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:58.483 --> 01:29:04.466]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[01:29:05.774 --> 01:29:16.163]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[01:29:16.163 --> 01:29:28.894]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[01:29:29.574 --> 01:29:41.084]  Treatment packages specifically for COVID, post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes, and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[01:29:41.084 --> 01:29:49.291]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health advice.
[01:29:49.291 --> 01:29:57.458]  Come see The Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to The Wellness Company.
[01:29:59.130 --> 01:30:06.796]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing Infowars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[01:30:06.796 --> 01:30:08.858]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[01:30:08.858 --> 01:30:10.559]  They know we're telling the truth.
[01:30:10.559 --> 01:30:12.140]  They know we've got their number.
[01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:16.864]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[01:30:16.864 --> 01:30:19.466]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds.
[01:30:19.986 --> 01:30:20.607]  We're good to go.
[01:30:36.124 --> 01:30:36.424]  Thank you.

[01:33:00.330 --> 01:33:06.233]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.710 --> 01:33:25.932]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:25.932 --> 01:33:28.654]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.654 --> 01:33:46.062]  So, Fauci, four years ago, in a big C-SPAN interview with a bunch of the different directors of federal agencies, bragged and said, we're going to, quote, blow up the old system, we're going to get rid of approved drugs and products, we're going to force through whatever we want, probably using a novel virus out of China, something like the bird flu.
[01:33:46.062 --> 01:33:47.203]  We played the clip many times.
[01:33:48.524 --> 01:33:52.849]  And now concerted through the big corporations telling the UN what to do.
[01:33:52.849 --> 01:34:03.039]  They are doing this worldwide and the governments run by these World Economic Forum stooges, particularly in the case of New Zealand, have said lockdowns only rivaled by communist China.
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:06.663]  Decried by the West, but almost as bad.
[01:34:06.663 --> 01:34:19.415]  And Liz Gunn is a former well-known MSM journalist who is now on the right side of history, starting her own independent media outlet last year after she wrote a love letter to New Zealand as she watched Prime Minister destroy her country.
[01:34:19.415 --> 01:34:27.442]  She is now one of the leading voices speaking out against the tyrannical government in New Zealand and was asked by a friend to help Cole and Sam with their baby Will's story.
[01:34:28.203 --> 01:34:39.668]  Free New Zealand along with Counterspin Media have collaborated to make this important story go global as not only is it about baby Will's life, but it also has implications for people all over the world.
[01:34:39.668 --> 01:34:42.549]  FreeNZ.org.
[01:34:42.549 --> 01:34:43.969]  FreeNZ.org.
[01:34:43.969 --> 01:34:47.631]  We're going to go to her in a moment, but under Stalin's Russia,
[01:34:48.491 --> 01:35:05.577]  Under Hitler's Germany, if you study the history, they first came with euthanasia and forced medical actions, then they started euthanizing people forcibly, saying, oh, they wanted it, and they would come take your disabled child, and oh, they died at the hospital.
[01:35:05.577 --> 01:35:10.119]  And now in China and everywhere, oh, the men in white lab coats, they're really military, take you away.
[01:35:11.239 --> 01:35:14.621]  If any country tried this, there'd be an uprising worldwide, not just in the country.
[01:35:14.621 --> 01:35:17.042]  But if it's medical, oh, it's medical!
[01:35:17.042 --> 01:35:20.444]  They admit it's about the Great Reset and total power and control.
[01:35:20.444 --> 01:35:25.986]  I wanted to go back and keep them through the rest of the hour, but then go to Liz to get her take on this in a moment.
[01:35:25.986 --> 01:35:30.429]  Samantha Savage and Cole Reeves, who I didn't realize, are locked up in the medical facility.
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:59.019]  With themselves and the other twin baby to Will and they're forcing the procedure tomorrow and won't let them use their untainted blood donor which is a very common practice around the Western world that people know that having heart surgery is dangerous you can get really bad stuff in the blood supply and so you have friends or family that have a comparable type that's that'll work do it they said no which just takes the level of this to a whole nother level of tyranny so
[01:35:59.799 --> 01:36:03.040]  Other comments you'd like to make before we bring Liz Gunn in here?
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:06.441]  Samantha and Cole?
[01:36:06.441 --> 01:36:12.143]  Yeah, we'd just like to say that we know that God is in charge of this.
[01:36:12.143 --> 01:36:13.143]  We're believers.
[01:36:13.143 --> 01:36:24.846]  We've got a great faith and that is really one of the underpinning things as to why we are standing for this because it's so much bigger than us.
[01:36:24.846 --> 01:36:27.667]  It's so much bigger than the baby and God
[01:36:28.291 --> 01:36:31.153]  He does not want this to be perpetrated on mankind.
[01:36:31.153 --> 01:36:34.435]  He doesn't want it to be perpetrated on the baby.
[01:36:34.435 --> 01:36:36.437]  So, you know, we give him all the credit.
[01:36:36.437 --> 01:36:37.517]  We give him all the honor.
[01:36:37.517 --> 01:36:39.619]  We seek nothing for ourselves.
[01:36:39.619 --> 01:36:42.881]  We just seek, you know, his right way for the baby.
[01:36:42.881 --> 01:36:49.485]  And, you know, so I'm a bit speechless still.
[01:36:49.485 --> 01:36:51.086]  But that's where we stand from.
[01:36:51.086 --> 01:36:54.769]  We stand from a godly point of view that this is not right.
[01:36:55.885 --> 01:37:00.448]  In any degree that it's been, you know, played out.
[01:37:00.448 --> 01:37:14.997]  So yeah, our faith is what's holding us and keeping us strong and sustaining us and ultimately we know, yeah, that the judge has ruled that the hospital is in favour, you know, but ultimately we know that God is in control.
[01:37:14.997 --> 01:37:15.478]  That's right.
[01:37:16.952 --> 01:37:17.653]  Beautiful.
[01:37:17.653 --> 01:37:19.315]  And the good news is this.
[01:37:19.315 --> 01:37:22.719]  China's having to stop their lockdowns because the people hit the breaking point.
[01:37:22.719 --> 01:37:23.921]  They're backing down all over.
[01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:25.303]  They're going to try to come back.
[01:37:25.303 --> 01:37:29.869]  But it shows when we stand up, and you guys are at the very tip of the spear, we have victory.
[01:37:29.869 --> 01:37:32.412]  I just want to tell the listeners when they call and thank me on air, you thank me.
[01:37:32.412 --> 01:37:32.933]  No.
[01:37:32.933 --> 01:37:34.374]  We're all, I want to thank you.
[01:37:34.995 --> 01:37:45.057]  And I want to thank Liz Gunn, who we're about to bring on, because we're all in this together, and it's the listeners supporting this broadcast, and their word of mouth is just as important as anything we do.
[01:37:45.057 --> 01:37:54.120]  The only way this gets out is everybody having the courage to tell the truth and realize how important their voice is to circumvent the censors, the AI, and the tyranny.
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:59.341]  Your own evil Prime Minister that's under the control of Klaus Schwab, you know, has just been caught lying everywhere.
[01:37:59.981 --> 01:38:00.462]  Sure, sure.
[01:38:24.318 --> 01:38:26.259]  My expert view is this, Alex.
[01:38:26.259 --> 01:38:28.159]  God wins either way now.
[01:38:28.159 --> 01:38:29.500]  God absolutely wins.
[01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:42.443]  Because many, many Kiwis, thousands, I'd say millions, are waking up in horror and going, even those who've been asleep, who've been going along with the lies of this Prime Minister, who've been saying, she wouldn't hurt us.
[01:38:42.443 --> 01:38:44.384]  Oh, she was so lovely in the Christchurch.
[01:38:45.484 --> 01:38:47.025]  Oh, she was so trusted.
[01:38:47.025 --> 01:38:48.565]  She was a hero of the world.
[01:38:48.565 --> 01:38:53.446]  And people around the world who used to think, oh, you've got a great Prime Minister down there in New Zealand.
[01:38:53.446 --> 01:38:57.527]  Messages from all over saying, this is monstrous.
[01:38:57.527 --> 01:38:59.967]  Who is this monster running your country?
[01:38:59.967 --> 01:39:01.968]  How could she stay silent through all of this?
[01:39:01.968 --> 01:39:03.508]  Not one word.
[01:39:03.508 --> 01:39:11.870]  While this little baby, this beautiful little boy, who remember there was one other baby, Alex, who was born at Christmas time, who changed the world.
[01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:13.810]  Is this another one of those?
[01:39:13.810 --> 01:39:27.856]  And Will and Sam, baby Will is just such a beautiful, beautiful creature, but Cole and Sam would never make any claim beyond the fact that he's a very sacred little human baby.
[01:39:27.856 --> 01:39:39.201]  But there is something about the energy of this baby that has God's might within him, around him, and reaching out from him into the hearts of many New Zealanders.
[01:39:39.201 --> 01:39:39.341]  So
[01:39:40.492 --> 01:39:41.853]  God wins either way.
[01:39:41.853 --> 01:39:44.795]  And I'll tell you the other side of that, Alex.
[01:39:44.795 --> 01:39:46.736]  The government loses.
[01:39:46.736 --> 01:39:48.918]  They've won the case and they lose.
[01:39:48.918 --> 01:39:49.298]  Why?
[01:39:49.298 --> 01:39:51.159]  Because there's no trust for them.
[01:39:51.159 --> 01:39:52.500]  There's no respect for them.
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:53.321]  There's no love.
[01:39:53.321 --> 01:39:57.143]  The only thing they're left with is bullying and conniving.
[01:39:57.143 --> 01:40:03.027]  Yesterday morning I was in and Sam was being pursued by two big burly security guards.
[01:40:03.027 --> 01:40:03.988]  She needed to go.
[01:40:03.988 --> 01:40:08.851]  She said to me, I needed to go for a walk, meditate, pray with God, ask for guidance.
[01:40:08.851 --> 01:40:09.712]  I needed time out.
[01:40:10.521 --> 01:40:14.102]  And I went up to the head nurse and I questioned her.
[01:40:14.102 --> 01:40:17.123]  I'm a journalist, I'm trained in law, so I'm good at questioning.
[01:40:17.123 --> 01:40:22.645]  But I'm also extremely smart and I was calm, I was clear, I was directed in my questions.
[01:40:22.645 --> 01:40:25.566]  But I wasn't intimidated and they didn't like it.
[01:40:25.566 --> 01:40:29.707]  And so what they did was trump up a charge that I had intimidated them.
[01:40:29.707 --> 01:40:31.307]  I think that was what it was.
[01:40:31.307 --> 01:40:32.688]  Came into the room.
[01:40:32.688 --> 01:40:39.470]  At one point there were up to 17, I think about nine big burly henchmen and a whole lot of
[01:40:40.587 --> 01:40:44.190]  Supposedly senior nurses and things, one of whom wouldn't even look at Sam.
[01:40:44.190 --> 01:40:47.414]  And I kept saying, she is the mother here.
[01:40:47.414 --> 01:40:50.177]  Your job is to make this a safe place.
[01:40:50.177 --> 01:40:55.722]  This is not a safe environment for this mother who is still feeding her babies.
[01:40:55.722 --> 01:40:58.525]  She won't have the milk if you don't look after her.
[01:40:58.525 --> 01:40:59.486]  Stop stressing her.
[01:40:59.486 --> 01:41:00.808]  Get out of this room.
[01:41:00.808 --> 01:41:02.530]  Will they march me out of that hospital?
[01:41:03.150 --> 01:41:04.751]  Because I stuck up for a mother.
[01:41:04.751 --> 01:41:09.354]  Because I questioned why they're putting henchmen to follow her, intimidate her.
[01:41:09.354 --> 01:41:11.035]  She will never be broken.
[01:41:11.035 --> 01:41:21.342]  But we are so extraordinarily lucky in New Zealand that we had people of this quality, of this calibre, of Cole and Sam, to stand up for their baby.
[01:41:21.342 --> 01:41:30.028]  Because I think most other parents would have been broken by the psychological games that have clearly come from higher-ups.
[01:41:30.618 --> 01:41:35.539]  And we know that this Prime Minister is capable of the most inordinate cruelty.
[01:41:35.539 --> 01:41:40.540]  Interestingly, Alex, all over our FreeNZ pages last night were trolls.
[01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:43.301]  And we know they're government trolls because they're sort of bots.
[01:41:43.301 --> 01:41:44.041]  They've got to look.
[01:41:44.041 --> 01:41:45.441]  The pages don't have friends.
[01:41:45.441 --> 01:41:46.781]  They don't have comments.
[01:41:46.781 --> 01:41:58.284]  But they just put up these cruel, cruel comments and laughter emojis on a night that for most Kiwis has been a night of grave grieving.
[01:41:59.031 --> 01:42:05.712]  Grieving for the country that we all long for, that we all feel Baby Will is calling us back to.
[01:42:05.712 --> 01:42:13.314]  There were candlelight vigils before the hearing in court.
[01:42:13.314 --> 01:42:17.975]  I'm just shocked at the judge's decision.
[01:42:17.975 --> 01:42:19.695]  There was an admission.
[01:42:19.695 --> 01:42:22.456]  I'll tell you this, Alex, this was incredible.
[01:42:22.456 --> 01:42:26.617]  All the time that I've been engaged with them, right up to the night before that hearing,
[01:42:27.589 --> 01:42:39.758]  The doctors in the hospital and the head of NZ Blood Service were arrogantly dismissing the concerns of this well-researched couple, saying, oh, the blood's all the same, what are you talking about?
[01:42:39.758 --> 01:42:51.606]  On the night before the hearing in court, a pile of affidavits were delivered to the lawyers for Sam and Cole, and those affidavits were admissing
[01:42:52.475 --> 01:42:56.222]  That the blood service knows at least this.
[01:42:56.222 --> 01:42:57.103]  Hold on, stay there.
[01:42:57.103 --> 01:42:57.724]  We gotta go to break.
[01:42:57.724 --> 01:42:58.145]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:58.145 --> 01:43:01.511]  I want you to remember two words.
[01:43:01.511 --> 01:43:02.493]  InfoWars Platinum.
[01:43:04.025 --> 01:43:14.113]  In the history of InfoWare supplements, and they're amazing, this is hands down the most powerful, game-changing products we've ever offered to the public.
[01:43:14.113 --> 01:43:21.859]  Now, all three of these are private labels of three national bestsellers put out by a pharmaceutical company that also makes high-end supplements.
[01:43:21.859 --> 01:43:23.781]  And the owners are listening and are supporting.
[01:43:23.781 --> 01:43:25.502]  So they're giving them to us at 40% off
[01:43:26.843 --> 01:43:27.583]  We're good to go.
[01:43:37.072 --> 01:43:41.797]  HGH Max Boost, and of course, 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[01:43:41.797 --> 01:43:49.806]  Read about them at InfoWarsTore.com, learn about them, and then try them out for yourself, and I know you will be a repeat customer, which is awesome.
[01:43:49.806 --> 01:43:55.252]  It'll empower your life, make your life more amazing, and it will keep us on the air of 360 wind.
[01:43:55.252 --> 01:43:58.196]  InfoWars Platinum, now available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:43:58.656 --> 01:44:19.288]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[01:44:19.788 --> 01:44:32.911]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[01:44:32.911 --> 01:44:41.753]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air.
[01:44:41.753 --> 01:44:48.174]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[01:44:48.274 --> 01:44:49.717]  So, continue to do it.
[01:44:49.717 --> 01:44:51.901]  Go to places like InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:51.901 --> 01:44:54.005]  Go to the places like Save InfoWars.
[01:44:54.005 --> 01:44:58.975]  Continue to keep InfoWars alive, because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:07.805]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[01:45:07.805 --> 01:45:09.866]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[01:45:09.866 --> 01:45:11.567]  They know we're telling the truth.
[01:45:11.567 --> 01:45:13.128]  They know we've got their number.
[01:45:13.128 --> 01:45:17.851]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[01:45:17.851 --> 01:45:20.453]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds.
[01:45:21.113 --> 01:45:21.753]  We're good to go.
[01:45:37.110 --> 01:45:37.410]  Thank you.
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:07.823]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[01:46:07.823 --> 01:46:09.883]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[01:46:09.883 --> 01:46:11.584]  They know we're telling the truth.
[01:46:11.584 --> 01:46:13.144]  They know we've got their number.
[01:46:13.144 --> 01:46:17.886]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[01:46:17.886 --> 01:46:20.467]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds.
[01:46:21.007 --> 01:46:21.647]  We're good to go.
[01:46:37.208 --> 01:46:42.069]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:17.093 --> 01:47:18.394]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:47:34.164 --> 01:47:37.546]  Samantha Savage and Cole Reeves have twins.
[01:47:37.546 --> 01:47:43.631]  Saybabywill.com is the baby that the mother discovered had a heart problem, not the medical system, of course.
[01:47:43.631 --> 01:47:45.773]  And then they said, oh, we're going to give them the titanium blood.
[01:47:45.773 --> 01:47:47.054]  She said, well, I'll get a donor.
[01:47:47.054 --> 01:47:47.954]  I'll get people that haven't done it.
[01:47:47.954 --> 01:47:49.115]  They said, no, we're doing it.
[01:47:49.115 --> 01:47:50.416]  So they sent in dozens of police.
[01:47:50.416 --> 01:47:51.077]  They've got them locked up.
[01:47:51.077 --> 01:47:52.978]  They're going to do the surgery tomorrow.
[01:47:52.978 --> 01:47:55.840]  Now, this is a raping of this child.
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:58.022]  This is a biological rape.
[01:47:59.229 --> 01:48:05.114]  This is medical experimentation, and they just want to normalize all this, but it's not going to be normalized.
[01:48:05.114 --> 01:48:10.778]  We should all be praying for little baby Will right now.
[01:48:10.778 --> 01:48:12.139]  Liz Gunn, you got caught up on the break.
[01:48:12.139 --> 01:48:17.103]  You were getting into the stack of affidavits that came in just recently with people.
[01:48:17.103 --> 01:48:26.331]  I mean, it's a well-known scandal everywhere, how tainted the blood supply is, much less the huge scandal of the blood crisis in Europe, in Australia, in New Zealand, in the U.S.
[01:48:26.331 --> 01:48:28.413]  and Canada, of people not wanting
[01:48:30.175 --> 01:48:42.817]  To take blood from people who have been given an experimental mRNA shot they admit continues to grow prions or protein crystals associated with spongiform encephalopathy type disorders, not just myocarditis.
[01:48:46.155 --> 01:48:50.319]  It's shocking, and we will really need to focus the lens on New Zealand Blood.
[01:48:50.319 --> 01:48:51.800]  It's called NZ Blood.
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:49:12.658]  If anybody from anywhere in the world wants to write a protest letter, look up NZ Blood and write a letter of extreme protest, because it was their lawyer in the hearing that absolutely blocked this, who said, look, even if the judgment or the decision goes the way of this family, NZ Blood will not help them.
[01:49:13.391 --> 01:49:14.952]  Get the unjabbed blood.
[01:49:14.952 --> 01:49:17.294]  That was in effect what this lawyer said.
[01:49:17.294 --> 01:49:21.576]  It was a very dark last part of that hearing.
[01:49:21.576 --> 01:49:24.338]  That's not how they get the people that haven't taken the poison shot.
[01:49:24.338 --> 01:49:26.259]  But you got interrupted by the satellite break.
[01:49:26.259 --> 01:49:28.020]  Their hard breaks were on over 400 stations.
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:30.102]  I hate to go to those, but they're hard breaks.
[01:49:30.102 --> 01:49:32.663]  You were talking about those affidavits.
[01:49:32.663 --> 01:49:34.104]  The affidavits.
[01:49:34.104 --> 01:49:41.529]  They came in and in those affidavits, finally, NZ Blood admitted after denying and denying to the face of this family
[01:49:42.176 --> 01:49:42.236]  Yes.
[01:49:57.396 --> 01:50:00.237]  Absolutely, and they would have perjured themselves, Alex.
[01:50:22.737 --> 01:50:24.698]  It is just shocking what we've seen.
[01:50:24.698 --> 01:50:26.339]  We've seen Sam locked down.
[01:50:26.339 --> 01:50:27.880]  We've seen her bullied constantly.
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:34.543]  We've seen her asked to go to meetings late at night when she's breastfeeding the children when she needs to be looked after.
[01:50:34.543 --> 01:50:37.445]  And now we're seeing this baby taken from.
[01:50:37.445 --> 01:50:40.427]  And for anybody who thinks it's just this, it's not.
[01:50:40.427 --> 01:50:43.008]  As you said earlier, it always goes one step further.
[01:50:43.008 --> 01:50:48.711]  How far are we now from the state being able to say, oh, we want this newborn baby to have three injections immediately.
[01:50:48.711 --> 01:50:50.392]  And we deem that that's the best thing.
[01:50:50.812 --> 01:50:56.215]  And we've got brought up doctors, we've got whatever else we need to say that that's the right thing.
[01:50:56.215 --> 01:50:57.836]  So now you parents have no right.
[01:50:57.836 --> 01:51:11.224]  So every single parent anywhere in the world or planned to be parent or grandparent, or should I say human, needs to be horrified at what Jacinda Ardern's government has done here in this decision.
[01:51:11.224 --> 01:51:12.164]  Because ultimately,
[01:51:13.917 --> 01:51:18.863]  This lies at the feet of the person leading the country with one stroke of a pen.
[01:51:18.863 --> 01:51:21.286]  She could say, no, we override this.
[01:51:21.286 --> 01:51:22.287]  It is not just.
[01:51:22.287 --> 01:51:22.807]  It's not.
[01:51:22.807 --> 01:51:27.913]  It makes no scientific sense because of what they admitted to in court, that there's product in the blood.
[01:51:27.913 --> 01:51:31.437]  So I am going to step in as this heroic prime minister.
[01:51:31.437 --> 01:51:33.520]  I love to be seen like that overseas.
[01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:37.963]  I'm going to step in and finally do something that does not brutalize my people.
[01:51:37.963 --> 01:51:41.345]  But she's a slave of the globalists and Klaus Schwab, she can't do it.
[01:51:41.345 --> 01:51:53.234]  We have the parents Samantha Savage and Cole Reeves here, ShaveBabyWill.com, but they're tough, so I'm going to go ahead and just say this, and I'm a parent of four and I can't even, I totally empathetically feel like it's my baby too, so it tears my guts out.
[01:51:53.234 --> 01:51:55.856]  But you use the Christ example, them coming after our children.
[01:51:56.676 --> 01:51:58.397]  Is that innocence under attack?
[01:51:58.397 --> 01:52:10.564]  God forbid, and it's not going to happen, we're praying to God, but if this was a Christ-like moment, God forbid the baby does get sick from the blood, they'll try to cover that up, or God forbid something else happens to the baby, it'll be their waterloo.
[01:52:10.564 --> 01:52:18.609]  So they're really rolling the dice right here with this archetypal Christ figure.
[01:52:18.609 --> 01:52:21.251]  Yeah, well that's right.
[01:52:21.251 --> 01:52:26.114]  They're stepping over the line that can't really be stepped over.
[01:52:27.778 --> 01:52:35.166]  Elaborate on that call on Samantha.
[01:52:35.166 --> 01:52:46.136]  What's happening here is just the beginning of an authoritarian takeover and it's coming for all of us if we don't do what Sam and I have undertaken.
[01:52:46.136 --> 01:52:48.599]  We realized really quickly that
[01:52:50.410 --> 01:52:56.095]  We're standing for every person that wants their own human right and their own decisions for their own family.
[01:52:56.095 --> 01:53:01.379]  And everybody that might need a blood transfusion, they don't have any choice.
[01:53:01.379 --> 01:53:04.101]  They're getting what they're going to give them.
[01:53:04.101 --> 01:53:05.382]  And that's not right.
[01:53:05.382 --> 01:53:09.746]  These people have made an informed consent to not have an injection, which is totally their right.
[01:53:10.253 --> 01:53:13.636]  But now, you cut yourself and you don't have any rights.
[01:53:13.636 --> 01:53:21.762]  You're just going to get pumped full of whatever they deem is safe for you, where it's been proven clearly that it's not safe.
[01:53:21.762 --> 01:53:31.150]  And you're speaking, detained with your wife and children, in this medical facility, now being converted to a Nuremberg-violating, angel-of-death operation.
[01:53:31.150 --> 01:53:33.472]  I'm sorry, that's what this is?
[01:53:33.472 --> 01:53:35.994]  Yep.
[01:53:35.994 --> 01:53:37.255]  We just ask that, you know,
[01:53:37.754 --> 01:53:39.955]  Everyone just speak up.
[01:53:39.955 --> 01:53:41.416]  Speak up.
[01:53:41.416 --> 01:53:43.077]  Stand tall with us.
[01:53:43.077 --> 01:53:48.740]  We want to thank you for all the New Zealanders that are standing with us.
[01:53:48.740 --> 01:54:00.587]  Liz and Sue, our lawyer, everybody that's involved in this, Counterspin, all the people that have given hours and hours of their time.
[01:54:00.587 --> 01:54:05.109]  We're just asking please continue because the fight's not over.
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:09.182]  We're still standing, we're still fighting for our baby.
[01:54:09.182 --> 01:54:13.126]  You know, unfortunately, we seem to be on the front line this right minute.
[01:54:13.126 --> 01:54:18.171]  You know, hey, we'd all rather be somewhere else than doing something else and just on the farm.
[01:54:18.171 --> 01:54:21.535]  But it's just so, it's so wrong.
[01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:28.747]  We've got to continue standing right to their last breath now.
[01:54:28.747 --> 01:54:30.228]  They've decided it's going to be that way.
[01:54:30.228 --> 01:54:33.712]  They could have decided to make it go away and sign some papers and it would have gone away.
[01:54:33.712 --> 01:54:38.136]  But no, they're challenging good people.
[01:54:38.136 --> 01:54:40.779]  They're coming against God and God's will.
[01:54:40.779 --> 01:54:43.021]  And they're coming against Will.
[01:54:43.021 --> 01:54:43.822]  That's our baby's name.
[01:54:43.822 --> 01:54:44.763]  Our baby's name is Will.
[01:54:46.573 --> 01:54:48.816]  He's really important.
[01:54:48.816 --> 01:54:56.445]  God's using this child to awaken the world that there's a big problem with blood and we need to have
[01:54:58.388 --> 01:55:06.776]  Just blood products available that we're all comfortable with and if people are comfortable with New Zealand's blood service, that's fine, they can have that.
[01:55:06.776 --> 01:55:22.652]  But we're having our rights taken away and we're also having massive deletions from the blood bank's websites that they offered the service but now they don't because we want something that's so controversial and hey, at the end of the day, the question is well,
[01:55:23.351 --> 01:55:31.319]  You know, if we give these people this, then it poses the question in six billion people's mind, what's going on inside me.
[01:55:31.319 --> 01:55:35.222]  And in the free market, everyone will reject their tainted blood, and then that's game over for them.
[01:55:35.222 --> 01:55:36.003]  Exactly.
[01:55:36.003 --> 01:55:37.625]  You're the first domino to fall.
[01:55:37.625 --> 01:55:41.048]  That's why this is so incredibly important.
[01:55:41.048 --> 01:55:42.089]  Liz Gunn, comments on that?
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:51.227]  Yeah, if the decision had gone the right way, people would have said, wait a minute, does that mean there's a difference between the bloods?
[01:55:51.227 --> 01:55:55.452]  Does that mean something was put in my body that is still in the blood system?
[01:55:55.452 --> 01:56:00.917]  Does that mean the Prime Minister lied to me about it being safe and effective, which she said over and over?
[01:56:00.917 --> 01:56:03.260]  And then all the cards would have fallen down.
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:05.161]  I'm particularly worried.
[01:56:05.161 --> 01:56:11.285]  Somebody sent me last night something about the judge that he rolled out from Bell Gully, a law firm in Auckland.
[01:56:11.285 --> 01:56:14.447]  He rolled out the government's climate change.
[01:56:14.447 --> 01:56:18.949]  He was in charge of that climate change policy rollout and stepped down from there to become a judge.
[01:56:18.949 --> 01:56:21.231]  Now, I just leave that there as a fact.
[01:56:21.231 --> 01:56:26.174]  I need to investigate that more, but certainly we'll be looking at New Zealand's blood service
[01:56:26.986 --> 01:56:40.255]  If we have anybody overseas who can reach out with brilliant ideas, the trouble with this decision is if we go back for an appeal, the actual appeal has to go before the same judge.
[01:56:40.255 --> 01:56:41.736]  It's the way
[01:56:42.352 --> 01:56:47.076]  This was an interim hearing on this application.
[01:56:47.076 --> 01:56:48.458]  It wasn't a full trial.
[01:56:48.458 --> 01:56:50.399]  And we thought of going to a full trial.
[01:56:50.399 --> 01:57:03.011]  And the delays and the stresses that they're putting this family under made me feel that the one option we have is for millions from around the world to contact Jacinda Ardern's office in Wellington.
[01:57:03.644 --> 01:57:04.965]  And say, we see you.
[01:57:04.965 --> 01:57:08.066]  She doesn't like being seen beyond our shores for the cruelty she does.
[01:57:08.066 --> 01:57:08.866]  We see you.
[01:57:08.866 --> 01:57:10.687]  We do not agree with your decision.
[01:57:10.687 --> 01:57:14.688]  You must let this family have the unjammed blood for their baby.
[01:57:14.688 --> 01:57:20.451]  Will is the example of us all controlling our own bodies and our own futures.
[01:57:20.451 --> 01:57:21.391]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:57:21.391 --> 01:57:22.411]  Do five more minutes with us.
[01:57:22.411 --> 01:57:23.752]  This is so important.
[01:57:23.752 --> 01:57:25.032]  Savebabywill.com.
[01:57:25.032 --> 01:57:26.813]  We're going to break for two minutes.
[01:57:26.813 --> 01:57:28.714]  But ladies and gentlemen, this is just pure tyranny.
[01:57:29.747 --> 01:57:32.209]  And they want to just condition us to accept this.
[01:57:32.209 --> 01:57:33.991]  We're not accepting this.
[01:57:33.991 --> 01:57:35.873]  We're not going quietly into the night.
[01:57:35.873 --> 01:57:37.274]  It's not happening.
[01:57:37.274 --> 01:57:38.355]  And she's scared.
[01:57:38.355 --> 01:57:40.357]  Her numbers are plunging.
[01:57:40.357 --> 01:57:41.638]  All of these criminals are in trouble.
[01:57:41.638 --> 01:57:42.739]  Fauci's going to get arrested.
[01:57:42.739 --> 01:57:45.181]  There's criminal investigations in Florida.
[01:57:45.181 --> 01:57:46.122]  We've only begun to fight.
[01:57:49.011 --> 01:57:53.554]  I'm taking a lot of supplements over the years, since high school, and they had great effects.
[01:57:53.554 --> 01:57:57.237]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[01:57:57.237 --> 01:58:08.065]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[01:58:08.065 --> 01:58:09.426]  These products work great for women as well.
[01:58:10.026 --> 01:58:12.427]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[01:58:12.427 --> 01:58:14.908]  It's a number one national bestseller under another name.
[01:58:14.908 --> 01:58:20.711]  We got it discounted for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com under the label InfoWars Platinum.
[01:58:20.711 --> 01:58:22.972]  We've also got HGH Max Boost.
[01:58:22.972 --> 01:58:24.272]  Read all about it.
[01:58:24.272 --> 01:58:25.773]  Be very safe with it.
[01:58:25.773 --> 01:58:29.095]  Take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[01:58:29.095 --> 01:58:30.575]  Don't do it during the day.
[01:58:30.575 --> 01:58:33.597]  1776 testosterone boost.
[01:58:33.597 --> 01:58:34.657]  Totally incredible.
[01:58:34.657 --> 01:58:35.598]  Go read about them.
[01:58:35.598 --> 01:58:36.378]  Learn more about them.
[01:58:36.738 --> 01:58:41.444]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds.
[01:58:41.444 --> 01:58:42.025]  I was overweight.
[01:58:42.025 --> 01:58:43.967]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[01:58:56.142 --> 01:58:56.482]  We're good.
[01:59:11.988 --> 01:59:12.748]  We're good to go.
[01:59:34.821 --> 01:59:37.402]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.

[01:59:43.524 --> 01:59:44.784]  Beautifully said, brother.
[01:59:44.784 --> 01:59:50.066]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
