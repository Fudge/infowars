[00:00.000 --> 00:29.840]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:29.840 --> 00:37.120]  Tonight I couldn't sleep and I woke up about 2 a.m. and stayed up the rest of
[00:37.120 --> 00:41.520]  the morning and I already intended to come in to the broadcast today and cover
[00:41.520 --> 00:48.200]  this subject and then going through the huge stacks of news and videos. The very
[00:48.200 --> 00:52.880]  topic I was gonna hit appeared in the countless reams of reports I have them
[00:52.880 --> 00:57.840]  thrown off for me to scan over and so what I want to talk about at least in the
[00:57.840 --> 01:03.840]  first hour today on this Thursday live June 2nd edition is really what's
[01:03.840 --> 01:09.720]  happening on this planet so I'm gonna say it very succinctly and very simply
[01:09.720 --> 01:16.560]  there is a covert operation hitting us from dozens of different angles that is
[01:16.560 --> 01:22.760]  not just designed to eradicate all human life on the planet but there is a
[01:22.760 --> 01:31.840]  worldwide secret agency program spraying quote biocides into the atmosphere
[01:31.840 --> 01:39.720]  that are added to jet fuel to poison and kill and mutate all life on earth now
[01:39.720 --> 01:44.600]  what's incredible is we've known about this for a long time and it's not just
[01:44.600 --> 01:50.240]  geoengineering it's not just weather control going on and then I noticed this
[01:50.240 --> 01:56.160]  morning a big ministry of defense report out of Spain and the EU complete with
[01:56.160 --> 02:03.400]  UN documents we translated the documents have them here and it's what we
[02:03.400 --> 02:11.760]  already knew but it's the total admission of how the system out of one
[02:11.760 --> 02:19.000]  side of its mouth denies this giant geoengineering program is going on but
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.200]  the other side of their mouth says yeah Bill Gates to control the weather and
[02:22.200 --> 02:35.760]  the case the EU in Spain we're spraying biocides on you that kill life but we're
[02:35.760 --> 02:42.040]  doing it to stop COVID-19 now there was a Nobel Prize one with the idea of
[02:42.040 --> 02:46.640]  adding aluminum dioxide and marium salts other things to jet fuel in 1992 to
[02:46.640 --> 02:50.480]  create nuclei to quote spray a smoke stream the atmosphere to protect the
[02:50.480 --> 02:55.280]  earth and that was the cover given to the bureaucracies around the world of
[02:55.280 --> 03:01.960]  this secret Manhattan style project of why they were doing this but the weather
[03:01.960 --> 03:08.520]  modification is only one small facet of it they now admit in UN EU and Spanish
[03:08.520 --> 03:14.320]  documents we have right here today that these chemicals are meant to kill life
[03:14.320 --> 03:22.040]  and so when people in the government asked about that in Spain last year the
[03:22.040 --> 03:26.560]  government then wrote a report to him saying yeah it's to stop COVID ladies
[03:26.560 --> 03:36.280]  and gentlemen that is ridiculous you add to that the transgenderism and in
[03:36.280 --> 03:40.400]  California half the kids identifying as gay or transgender you you add to that
[03:40.400 --> 03:43.960]  the attack on the family you added that the poison injections masquerading as
[03:43.960 --> 03:47.800]  vaccines you added that all the GMO food nanotech being added to the food
[03:47.800 --> 03:51.560]  supply you added that the food shortages you added that the energy shut downs
[03:51.560 --> 03:58.720]  what does it all do it kills people and the argument is well we're doing this to
[03:58.720 --> 04:05.680]  save the earth wink wink but really it's killing the earth and changing its
[04:05.680 --> 04:12.280]  atmosphere and making it to where plants and animals and insects can't live and
[04:12.280 --> 04:17.600]  their populations are collapsing as well and then you add the sharing on top the
[04:17.600 --> 04:23.160]  accelerating artificial electromagnetic microwave radiation coming out of all
[04:23.160 --> 04:29.720]  the different systems like 5g and we're just designed to be eased into this
[04:29.720 --> 04:35.920]  death eased into this and and with all the available evidence if you add it all
[04:35.920 --> 04:41.600]  up together it points towards aliens I mean why would our own ruling class
[04:41.600 --> 04:45.440]  poison themselves poison their children why would they do this the whole earth
[04:45.440 --> 04:53.600]  and that's the speculation part is that there's been a deal made not with off
[04:53.600 --> 04:57.480]  world entities but inter dimensionals to do this and the globalists admit
[04:57.480 --> 05:04.560]  they're about to become gods they believe free world outlet comm that is a

[06:31.840 --> 06:41.320]  ladies and gentlemen it is Thursday in second 2022 I'm your host alex jones thank
[06:41.320 --> 06:44.680]  you for joining us today we have several big guests coming up we have open
[06:44.680 --> 06:49.920]  phones and I'm just gonna be completely honest with you right now I'm not giving
[06:49.920 --> 06:55.720]  up I'm far from giving up but I do have to really reassess everything we do
[06:55.720 --> 07:01.160]  here because we've been thanks the grace of God and your activism the most
[07:01.160 --> 07:05.760]  successful outlet in the world at exposing that the globalist exist and
[07:05.760 --> 07:10.040]  that they're predatory and that they want to depopulate humans but when you
[07:10.040 --> 07:15.400]  only expose that facet of it that they're transhumanists I believe they're
[07:15.400 --> 07:20.240]  about to transcend humanity you don't expose what they're really doing that
[07:20.240 --> 07:25.000]  is killing the planet itself while they pose as the guardians and the
[07:25.000 --> 07:31.000]  protectors of it and so we've known this for a long time but we're gonna not
[07:31.000 --> 07:38.480]  cover it now we're gonna cover it coming up at the bottom of the hour we're out
[07:38.480 --> 07:40.680]  of one side of their mouth they're telling you none of this human's
[07:40.680 --> 07:43.800]  nearing exist but out of the other side of their mouth they're saying we're
[07:43.800 --> 07:47.440]  doing it for global warming and we're spraying pesticide in the air to stop
[07:47.440 --> 07:56.320]  COVID biocide and I have the main line UN documents I have the main line EU
[07:56.320 --> 08:00.360]  documents and I have the Spanish government documents admitting oh we've
[08:00.360 --> 08:05.920]  increased the funding for this covert operation to spray pesticides on you to
[08:05.920 --> 08:10.920]  save you from COVID that's just the cover for them poisoning everybody the
[08:10.920 --> 08:17.440]  magnitude of this and how it's hidden in plain view absolutely bottles the
[08:17.440 --> 08:23.040]  mind so have NBC and ABC with graphics oh the planes fly over and they have
[08:23.040 --> 08:26.240]  chemicals out of the jet fuel and it creates a sunscreen to save you from
[08:26.240 --> 08:32.920]  global warming and another story saying it doesn't exist you're insane the
[08:32.920 --> 08:43.320]  geoengineering facet is only one small part of this it is a anti-cellular
[08:43.320 --> 08:53.000]  biocide which means simply an anti-life pesticide out of one side of their
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.840]  mouth they'll be like oh Bill Gates has a plan the Department of Energy has a
[08:57.840 --> 09:06.680]  plan to spray the clouds to shield you from global warming and then out of the
[09:06.680 --> 09:11.640]  other side oh the planes are causing global warming with their condensation
[09:11.640 --> 09:15.800]  trails we need to tax them so it's a total war on logic all they do is
[09:15.800 --> 09:19.840]  confuse everybody but in the Department of Energy documents in the EU documents
[09:19.840 --> 09:27.800]  in the UN world climate control treaties of 1978 and 79 it's all there I have the
[09:27.800 --> 09:36.760]  CIA director seven years ago Brennan laying it all out so that's coming up
[09:36.760 --> 09:40.880]  bottom of the hour we're gonna get it together and present that here for you
[09:40.880 --> 09:45.320]  because I saw a particular document we went to the Spanish government's own
[09:45.320 --> 09:49.360]  sign it's real and we already knew this but it's just the admission of the
[09:49.360 --> 09:57.280]  public we're spraying anti-life chemicals biocides on you for your own
[09:57.280 --> 10:02.760]  good the Spanish meteorological agency has confessed that Spain is being sprayed
[10:02.760 --> 10:11.680]  with lead dioxide silver dioxide and diatomite and more that is all coming up
[10:11.680 --> 10:17.280]  ladies and gentlemen bottom of the hour and what's so frustrating is people can
[10:17.280 --> 10:26.000]  pretend they're part of the power structure people can pretend that this
[10:26.000 --> 10:33.120]  isn't going on because it's so frightening but but it's still a
[10:33.120 --> 10:38.760]  reality it's still going on it's still happening and when you add the geo
[10:38.760 --> 10:43.640]  engineering and the and the poison spraying to the collapse of the animals
[10:43.640 --> 10:51.760]  and the insects and the biome it is a biocide which is a weapon that kills the
[10:51.760 --> 11:03.800]  biosphere and if you looked at the earth like an apple the skin of an apple is
[11:03.800 --> 11:18.200]  around 50 times thicker in comparison to the atmosphere of the earth the
[11:18.200 --> 11:29.000]  atmosphere is a tiny thin 15,000 foot gas that we live in it's our habitat it's
[11:29.000 --> 11:35.760]  it's where we exist and it is under giant unmitigated attack in a program a
[11:35.760 --> 11:45.240]  thousand times bigger conservatively than the Manhattan Project that gave us
[11:45.240 --> 11:51.120]  the atomic bomb fat man and little boy that were dropped on Hiroshima and
[11:51.120 --> 12:00.080]  Nakasaki that's 1940s technology so you add everything together we're being
[12:00.080 --> 12:10.400]  hit at every angle non-stop and I want to explain this very slowly again to
[12:10.400 --> 12:14.120]  everybody out there that is going along with the depopulation of humans the
[12:14.120 --> 12:19.200]  entire earth is being attacked the entire life-giving system is under attack
[12:19.200 --> 12:24.560]  the oceans are under attack and again the people running all this by design
[12:24.560 --> 12:29.320]  tell you that the end of humanity as we know it is here and the new life form is
[12:29.320 --> 12:34.680]  about to rise ladies and gentlemen that is going to be silicon and the
[12:34.680 --> 12:40.840]  atmosphere and everything is being designed for that new life form now you
[12:40.840 --> 12:45.920]  can ask yourself why is Claus Schwab and Bill Gates and Henry Kissinger and the
[12:45.920 --> 12:51.480]  New World Order doing this well they tell you in their own literature we don't
[12:51.480 --> 12:56.320]  believe in God yet we're going to become gods raker as well all of them now
[12:56.320 --> 13:00.720]  it's popularized what I told you about 20 years ago people like Harari you've
[13:00.720 --> 13:04.520]  all Harari saying you have no free will we're taking him over it's all over
[13:04.520 --> 13:08.320]  looking forward to the end of humanity Wall Street Journal New York Times
[13:08.320 --> 13:13.400]  humans are bad now they're saying all carbon is bad when they tell you carbon
[13:13.400 --> 13:18.880]  dioxide is bad that's what plants breathe this is a war on life a war on
[13:18.880 --> 13:25.400]  carbon and so the final piece of the puzzle that I don't scientifically have
[13:25.400 --> 13:31.240]  the answers to or psychologically is why these people are doing something that
[13:31.240 --> 13:36.880]  would make their own planet inhabitable themselves but I'm not stupid and I can
[13:36.880 --> 13:42.320]  read all the ancient texts of ancient cultures and what they said and I can
[13:42.320 --> 13:47.840]  see the religious works of Hollywood where the makers of the Prometheus films
[13:47.840 --> 13:51.600]  admit this is really their religion and this is what they believe that aliens
[13:51.600 --> 13:58.720]  from the star system serious created us and that they've been given the order to
[13:58.720 --> 14:05.680]  kill us and wipe us all out and so you read the Bible about a fallen entity
[14:05.680 --> 14:10.760]  that is eternal that is here trying to take over humanity in slavice then
[14:10.760 --> 14:15.960]  finally kill us and the description that if you believe the God of the Israelites
[14:15.960 --> 14:21.080]  we were warned about about a planetary government a mark to buy and sell total
[14:21.080 --> 14:28.760]  control over all life on earth massive depopulation it's all happening so
[14:28.760 --> 14:32.520]  whether you want to believe this or not whether they really are working for
[14:32.520 --> 14:39.240]  aliens or whether it's some program put into us by what you call aliens that we
[14:39.240 --> 14:44.120]  carry this out or whether it's some delusional fiction that's self-fulfilling
[14:44.120 --> 14:49.160]  prophecy that's been picked up to be implemented it doesn't matter because
[14:49.160 --> 14:56.160]  it's being done the planet is being murdered you are being murdered and
[14:56.160 --> 15:02.960]  everything else is window dressing our accuser dropping the sperm counts have
[15:02.960 --> 15:14.320]  plunged cancer has exploded heart attacks have skyrocketed and we have to
[15:14.320 --> 15:18.560]  decide what we're going to do as a species about this situation and
[15:18.560 --> 15:23.760]  understand I've given you next year's news today well I'm telling you now this
[15:23.760 --> 15:28.520]  is here you don't need to ask me to know that you see it everywhere and so
[15:28.520 --> 15:33.960]  anyone serving the system and playing along like you're on the winning team
[15:33.960 --> 15:42.120]  is a fool this is nasty this is as bad as it gets and this is real and we're
[15:42.120 --> 15:46.520]  smart enough to come together have a group awakening to it and remove the
[15:46.520 --> 15:52.120]  collaborators that are working with this off-world operation Satan from our
[15:52.120 --> 15:56.440]  planet we have to defeat them before we go to the stars I can let us just get
[15:56.440 --> 16:01.280]  off the planet without a fight if you're concerned about the power grid and want
[16:01.280 --> 16:05.520]  to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity this will be the most

[19:46.680 --> 19:51.720]  of the same stuff that's in there that is now in here in a very large amount so
[19:51.720 --> 19:55.720]  again get the power of grandma's chicken soup with the power of turmeric and
[19:55.720 --> 20:01.920]  everything else with the new and improved bone broth at infowarstore.com
[20:01.920 --> 20:12.920]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:12.920 --> 20:19.760]  we can and we will defeat this but we must get full spectrum awareness before
[20:19.760 --> 20:24.160]  we can do it only the whole spirit can deliver that payload from the front lines
[20:24.160 --> 20:31.360]  of the information war it's Alex Jones finally the major Republican senators
[20:31.360 --> 20:35.360]  Halsey Gabbard's
[20:35.360 --> 20:41.400]  Tucker Carlson Joe Rogan are talking about our enemy being world government and a
[20:41.400 --> 20:44.960]  private corporate crime syndicate launching the great reset and build back
[20:44.960 --> 20:52.000]  better here's Tucker Carlson identifying the enemy last night the truth is any
[20:52.000 --> 20:55.760]  government that tries to make you more dependent any government that tries to
[20:55.760 --> 21:00.840]  make you less self-sufficient is by definition a malicious government they
[21:00.840 --> 21:05.360]  are not on your side they're trying to hurt you for my NHL player Theo Flurry
[21:05.360 --> 21:09.120]  understands that he's a Canadian he played for many years in the NHL if you're a
[21:09.120 --> 21:13.040]  hockey fan you know exactly who he is he's your hero he's now the director of
[21:13.040 --> 21:17.720]  media for Canadians for truth justice and freedom he joins us tonight yeah
[21:17.720 --> 21:22.760]  thanks so much for coming on it's it's sad is really really sad for those of us
[21:22.760 --> 21:26.640]  small number but an avid number of Americans who really love Canada to see
[21:26.640 --> 21:34.960]  where your Prime Minister is taking the country I mean where's this going well
[21:34.960 --> 21:41.040]  we all know where it's going right it's you know this this ideology has been
[21:41.040 --> 21:47.200]  tried 24 times in the history of the planet and the only thing that comes out
[21:47.200 --> 21:53.840]  of it is death you know yes the communist globalist agenda and what we're
[21:53.840 --> 21:59.920]  seeing right now is we're seeing the insane running the asylum and you know
[21:59.920 --> 22:07.320]  we're headed down a wrong road and a wrong path right now to ban self-defense
[22:07.320 --> 22:12.960]  in the nation but legalized fentanyl when fentanyl is killing multiples of the
[22:12.960 --> 22:18.120]  people the guns are killing in Canada that doesn't wake Canadians up to the
[22:18.120 --> 22:25.160]  reality of this guy's maliciousness well you would hope it would but you know
[22:25.160 --> 22:30.360]  Tucker I I work in the field of trauma mental health and addiction I've been
[22:30.360 --> 22:36.360]  in this space for 15 years and yes the under the underlying theme is trauma
[22:36.360 --> 22:41.120]  right I believe that every single issue we have in society starts with trauma and
[22:41.120 --> 22:51.960]  what we've seen over the last you know probably three years is systemic trauma
[22:51.960 --> 22:57.800]  and systemic abuse caused by the government and and what we're seeing is
[22:57.800 --> 23:03.360]  we saw spike in mental health we saw spike in opioid use we saw spike in
[23:03.360 --> 23:08.520]  suicides you know seven and eight year old kids are having suicidal ideation so
[23:08.520 --> 23:16.480]  so this is pre-planned and pre-meditated and you know what what Trudeau
[23:16.480 --> 23:20.560]  announced in the last couple of days is all part of the plan and where we're
[23:20.560 --> 23:26.760]  headed and it's and it's sick and it's disgusting and it needs to stop that's
[23:26.760 --> 23:29.800]  the most interesting thing I've heard in a long time can you just be a little
[23:29.800 --> 23:34.320]  more specific and explain what you meant when you said the government has caused
[23:34.320 --> 23:40.720]  trauma on purpose for the last three years yeah there's political trauma they
[23:40.720 --> 23:48.040]  are causing as much chaos and trauma as they possibly can right we're seeing all
[23:48.040 --> 23:55.080]  these mass shootings now you know we're legalizing we're legalizing drugs think
[23:55.080 --> 24:00.960]  about that Tucker we're legalizing crystal meth is now a part of the
[24:00.960 --> 24:05.880]  Canadian health care system that's basically what they said that is complete
[24:05.880 --> 24:11.960]  insanity it's insanity and and it needs to stop this this type of rhetoric this
[24:11.960 --> 24:17.960]  type of leadership needs to go and it needs to go now and people are shell
[24:17.960 --> 24:21.360]  shocked after years of this I'm just gonna be I'm gonna be thinking about that
[24:21.360 --> 24:24.800]  for the next week I think that's just such an amazing observation including so
[24:24.800 --> 24:29.840]  clearly true yeah it's it's you know you're gonna see you know we're gonna
[24:29.840 --> 24:34.760]  have people of PTSD from the last three years because of us because of what's
[24:34.760 --> 24:39.560]  going on and and you know this is premeditated and preplanned the world
[24:39.560 --> 24:47.000]  economic forum is in Canada and is running our country and running the
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.120]  great reset the whatever you whatever the hell you want to call it it is
[24:52.120 --> 24:56.920]  happening in Canada and it is being played out the script is being played
[24:56.920 --> 25:02.560]  out every single day in this country and it's got to stop amazing
[25:02.560 --> 25:05.320]  conversation I'm really glad you came on so I hope we'll see you again Theo thank
[25:05.320 --> 25:30.880]  you absolutely thank you so much talker the truth is any
[25:36.320 --> 25:42.880]  all of it is a concerted operation to collapse civilization then those
[25:42.880 --> 25:48.360]  collapsing civilization will pose as the saviors and bring in their new
[25:48.360 --> 25:57.000]  technocracy on the ashes and bones of us everything they're doing is to create
[25:57.000 --> 26:02.880]  mass mental illness and to isolate us destroy infrastructure and we're in the
[26:02.880 --> 26:13.240]  middle of it and my greatest frustration is that I know this is all
[26:13.240 --> 26:20.000]  gonna happen we're already in it and I have been offered obviously to join
[26:20.000 --> 26:28.440]  these people many times over the years I've even named names and they just
[26:28.440 --> 26:33.840]  tell you it's the way it is it's gonna happen you should just surrender I should
[26:33.840 --> 26:39.120]  just surrender and join them and pray on 90% of the public even if I was a
[26:39.120 --> 26:44.560]  sociopath which I'm not I wouldn't be stupid enough to believe this is a safe
[26:44.560 --> 26:51.080]  system for myself in the future as if I wouldn't be betrayed by it there's the
[26:51.080 --> 26:58.040]  live show feed UN EU public documents confirm that a secret world government
[26:58.040 --> 27:05.880]  agency a spring the planet's atmosphere with life-feeling biosides as part of a
[27:05.880 --> 27:10.440]  terraforming project designed to kill all life on earth and that last part is
[27:10.440 --> 27:19.960]  the most important terraforming project designed to kill all life on earth we'll
[27:19.960 --> 27:24.920]  go over the documents when we come back but what's what's what's amazing is I
[27:24.920 --> 27:32.760]  have a stack of government reports and documents right now confirming that the
[27:32.760 --> 27:38.680]  so-called Pfizer and Moderna shots and AstraZeneca and J&J a racial immune
[27:38.680 --> 27:47.760]  system and don't protect you and still they move forward the attack with the
[27:47.760 --> 27:53.960]  poison injections with the poison spray in the air with the poison GMO food with
[27:53.960 --> 27:58.880]  the fluoridated toxified water with the electromagnetic 5g and other g radiation
[27:58.880 --> 28:04.760]  everywhere with the cultural spiritual attack with the annihilation of the
[28:04.760 --> 28:08.400]  family the open borders the cutting off the food the giant wars that are being
[28:08.400 --> 28:17.640]  started starvation and we sit there and see it happening we see them rolling out
[28:17.640 --> 28:29.000]  State Department memorandum 200 and 7277 public law and we watched the whole
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.360]  concerted attack go from beta to operational and people ask me all the
[28:35.360 --> 28:39.400]  time how do you take it what's it like to be under attack well I know I'm under
[28:39.400 --> 28:44.480]  attack I'm fighting back what's it like to not know you're under attack and to
[28:44.480 --> 28:51.600]  just stand down and let these people do this to you it's incredible well they're
[28:51.600 --> 28:54.680]  right back on the other side we'll look at their poison in the atmosphere
[28:54.680 --> 29:01.480]  straight ahead stay with us the first ten amendments to our country's
[29:01.480 --> 29:06.560]  Constitution were adopted in 1791 the first of these broadly protects the

[33:51.760 --> 33:57.720]  program no chemtrails going on I'm going to show you more than 20 government
[33:57.720 --> 34:01.840]  documents and mainstream news headlines admitting they're doing it and then when
[34:01.840 --> 34:08.680]  you read the fine print oh we're putting pesticides in the year not just a
[34:08.680 --> 34:14.400]  limited oxide that kills the ability for seeds to terminate and grow or the
[34:14.400 --> 34:22.640]  killing of the earth's ability to grow crops you add that into all the other
[34:22.640 --> 34:29.720]  projects and all the other operations it is beyond insane it is the murder of the
[34:29.720 --> 34:34.720]  planet itself but let me spend a few minutes on this we've come a long way
[34:34.720 --> 34:40.200]  together and in full wars is really the tip of the spear as we know we've had a
[34:40.200 --> 34:43.840]  lot of small donors and four store.com there's a big button you can donate or
[34:43.840 --> 34:47.120]  buy products right there at the top we've had some big donors come in the
[34:47.120 --> 34:51.280]  biggest ever very thankful to you because our finances were even worse than I
[34:51.280 --> 34:56.640]  thought a few months ago it was being kept from me in a nice way that we were
[34:56.640 --> 35:00.480]  back to three months on some of our biggest bills those are all paid up now
[35:00.480 --> 35:06.680]  thanks to the donations that have come in and folks stepping up but you really
[35:06.680 --> 35:09.520]  should buy the products in four store because they really are high-end they
[35:09.520 --> 35:14.400]  really are clean they really are game changing and amazing and now that we're
[35:14.400 --> 35:19.760]  in the black a little bit I don't intend to sink back in the red I'm fighting as
[35:19.760 --> 35:22.840]  hard as we can you're gonna get information here and full spectrum
[35:22.840 --> 35:28.480]  analysis that you're not gonna find anywhere else so we've sold out of 77
[35:28.480 --> 35:33.280]  percent of the coins as of this morning that means there's 27 percent of the
[35:33.280 --> 35:39.800]  coins left 2000 and change of course this is not a silver investment it's an
[35:39.800 --> 35:43.080]  investment in liberty and freedom in the future and art that's why there's a
[35:43.080 --> 35:48.000]  substantive markup it is original art by yours truly it's the third in the three
[35:48.000 --> 35:53.560]  part Founder series exclusively available at 1776 coin comm there's a big
[35:53.560 --> 35:58.160]  banner on the front page of info or store.com it says come and take you on

[36:08.520 --> 36:13.600]  help keep us on air and obviously those that our members and bought the coin will
[36:13.600 --> 36:16.360]  be getting a lot of special benefits I don't think that's why you bought the
[36:16.360 --> 36:20.960]  coin but it'll definitely pay you back big time by getting the coin if we're
[36:20.960 --> 36:26.400]  able to continue on which we'll do until our dying breath so it really is the

[39:01.080 --> 39:04.640]  in other documents but to have the European Union the United Nations of
[39:04.640 --> 39:11.960]  Spanish government all released documents that oh we're spraying
[39:11.960 --> 39:20.000]  biocides biocide just means pesticide that kills life on you it's being added
[39:20.000 --> 39:27.040]  to jet fuel it just it's just I mean that alone it almost does it injustice
[39:27.040 --> 39:29.760]  that I didn't come on air and just repeat that and cover the documents for
[39:29.760 --> 39:34.160]  four hours I mean you know cuz he just he just becomes like background noise
[39:34.160 --> 39:38.800]  like oh yeah they're spraying on us while those simultaneously say it
[39:38.800 --> 39:43.480]  doesn't exist but you add to that the drag Queen Pito time the attacks on the
[39:43.480 --> 39:46.960]  family the open borders the evaluation of currencies the shipping end of the
[39:46.960 --> 39:53.960]  toxic super poisons things like fentanyl the GMO crops the fluoride in the water
[39:53.960 --> 40:01.160]  the poison injections the horrible toxic anti-human pedophilic culture of
[40:01.160 --> 40:07.240]  Hollywood and just all of it and these are people turned over to evil all over
[40:07.240 --> 40:11.240]  the country they're having classes now at gyms to teach your five-year-old how
[40:11.240 --> 40:17.240]  to have gay sex I mean it's pedophilia folks they go from gay marriage five
[40:17.240 --> 40:23.240]  years ago to we want your children and again the media misrepresented says
[40:23.240 --> 40:26.600]  well you're mad at somebody because of sexual preference I'm not attacking any
[40:26.600 --> 40:31.560]  adults for what they do leave the children alone but the whole thing is a
[40:31.560 --> 40:37.760]  attack on the whole biological system and the nuclear family and how we operate
[40:37.760 --> 40:42.240]  and they admit that's the plan so Justice Tucker Carlson is great guest
[40:42.240 --> 40:47.560]  that I played a clip of last segment explain this is design trauma design
[40:47.560 --> 40:51.760]  pain to make you give up and make you commit suicide make you die it has a
[40:51.760 --> 41:00.280]  name from a based mind control from a base mind control MK ultra and they are
[41:00.280 --> 41:03.960]  externalizing what was done in laboratories in the last hundred years
[41:03.960 --> 41:10.880]  on the public now and it's a very small sick group of technocrats my father was
[41:10.880 --> 41:17.560]  top of his class in Texas top six scores everybody tied perfect scores not
[41:17.560 --> 41:20.760]  just the regular test a bunch of other ones he thought he signed up when he was
[41:20.760 --> 41:24.960]  14 to be part of NASA he wasn't signing up with NASA ladies and gentlemen it was
[41:24.960 --> 41:33.800]  above the CIA and when he was 16 years old he was at UT planned to as a high
[41:33.800 --> 41:37.480]  school student going to UT and they said here's the secret nuclear reactors and
[41:37.480 --> 41:40.600]  here's our plan and we're gonna establish world government we're gonna do all
[41:40.600 --> 41:44.880]  this we're gonna carry all this out my dad didn't tell me that until in game
[41:44.880 --> 41:50.040]  was about to come out in 2007 he came out of the office with my mom and they
[41:50.040 --> 41:54.080]  washed about an hour before he went to a ballet recital with my oldest daughter
[41:54.080 --> 42:03.560]  Charlotte who's now 18 and we're driving to the recital and my mother Carol
[42:03.560 --> 42:06.880]  says to my dad she said David because she knew he was involved in a lot of
[42:06.880 --> 42:11.400]  secret stuff she goes David it's not that bad as it he said no it's as bad as
[42:11.400 --> 42:16.520]  he says and worse and he just spilt his guts for 20 minutes in the car and I
[42:16.520 --> 42:21.840]  knew he was involved in all that and got out of it but the point is is that he
[42:21.840 --> 42:30.200]  knew all this stuff in the 1960s they had computers that were secret and he
[42:30.200 --> 42:34.800]  wasn't even in the most secretive areas in the 60s that weren't out until the
[42:34.800 --> 42:44.680]  80s CD-ROMs everything and it's still not on record there's a nuclear reactor
[42:44.680 --> 42:48.920]  under UT I mean I found government documents confirmed what my dad told
[42:48.920 --> 42:54.520]  me but imagine they've let all the best minds into this and the rest of us it's
[42:54.520 --> 43:01.800]  been decided we're all dead well you know what we're not dead info wars has
[43:01.800 --> 43:06.240]  made history you have made history in your support of info wars and one of
[43:06.240 --> 43:10.520]  the biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the sensors has been

[47:03.200 --> 47:08.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:08.480 --> 47:23.320]  And we are back exposing the secret plan for world government and a new form of
[47:23.320 --> 47:29.640]  life upon earth all their life to be exterminated. Here is the man who was the
[47:29.640 --> 47:34.960]  CIA director at the time seven years ago John Brennan admitting the giant
[47:34.960 --> 47:40.480]  geoengineering Tim drill program. Another example is the array of technologies
[47:40.480 --> 47:45.000]  often referred to collectively as geoengineering that potentially could
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.200]  help reverse the warming effects of global climate change one that has gained
[47:49.200 --> 47:55.360]  my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection or SAI a method of
[47:55.360 --> 47:59.480]  seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat in
[47:59.480 --> 48:04.800]  much the same way that volcanic eruptions do an SAI program could limit
[48:04.800 --> 48:08.560]  global temperature increases reducing some risks associated with higher
[48:08.560 --> 48:12.720]  temperatures and providing the world economy additional time to transition
[48:12.720 --> 48:17.760]  from fossil fuels. This process is also relatively expensive. The National
[48:17.760 --> 48:21.600]  Research Research Council estimates that a fully deployed SAI program would
[48:21.600 --> 48:27.240]  cost about ten billion dollars yearly. As promising as it may be moving forward
[48:27.240 --> 48:30.840]  on SAI would also raise a number of challenges for our government and for
[48:30.840 --> 48:34.880]  the international community. On the technical side greenhouse gas emission
[48:34.880 --> 48:38.840]  reductions would still have to accompany SAI to address other climate
[48:38.840 --> 48:43.880]  change effects such as ocean acidification because SAI alone would
[48:43.880 --> 48:49.040]  not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. On the geopolitical side the
[48:49.040 --> 48:54.040]  technology's potential to alter weather patterns and benefit certain regions of
[48:54.040 --> 48:58.760]  the world at the expense of other regions could trigger sharp opposition by
[48:58.760 --> 49:02.680]  some nations. That's right changing your weather changes somebody else's weather
[49:02.680 --> 49:09.680]  so we have that backdrop here we have this London Guardian article my month
[49:09.680 --> 49:16.760]  with Kim Trill conspiracy theorists Tammy Reedner partner are insane they
[49:16.760 --> 49:20.280]  believe there's a secret project when all it is is ice crystals from
[49:20.280 --> 49:25.520]  condensation know those fade away in a few minutes and then we get all of this
[49:25.520 --> 49:30.320]  Bill Gates venture aims to spray dust into the atmosphere to block the sun
[49:30.320 --> 49:37.040]  what could go wrong Forbes controversial spraying method aims to curb
[49:37.040 --> 49:44.600]  global warming CBS News geoengineering marks scientific gangs in UN report on
[49:44.600 --> 49:49.600]  dire climate future they've got to do it for own good but in Guardian what if
[49:49.600 --> 49:52.880]  it's too late to save our planet without geoengineering so the Guardian says it
[49:52.880 --> 49:57.880]  doesn't exist you're bad out of one article and then says it exists and it's
[49:57.880 --> 50:03.840]  good out of another science.org geoengineers inch closer to sun dimming
[50:03.840 --> 50:09.600]  balloon test geoengineering the quick and potentially catastrophic fix for
[50:09.600 --> 50:14.440]  climate change ABC News Australia here's what scientists really think about
[50:14.440 --> 50:20.400]  chemtrails how they can pose they're real they're good for you and then NBC
[50:20.400 --> 50:24.560]  News new airplane contrails add to climate change yes and the problem is
[50:24.560 --> 50:30.480]  about to get worse I mentioned this CIA director on the geopolitical risk of
[50:30.480 --> 50:38.080]  climate geoengineering which is ongoing and the stacks go on and on and on but
[50:38.080 --> 50:47.040]  what's the new information we already knew this their guest on years ago that
[50:47.040 --> 50:55.160]  did the tests and when got the samples of soil all over the world but
[50:55.160 --> 51:01.160]  particularly the US from Oregon to New York from Florida to Texas and they
[51:01.160 --> 51:10.160]  found very toxic extremely poisonous pesticides that kill everything plant
[51:10.160 --> 51:16.080]  animal amphibian fish insect it comes in contact with and you wonder why they
[51:16.080 --> 51:22.200]  admit mainstream news where all the insects or the windshield test I drove
[51:22.200 --> 51:26.840]  just a few months ago in the spring in Texas to our historic family land in
[51:26.840 --> 51:35.680]  East Texas in our hands since the late 1820s and normally when I travel in the
[51:35.680 --> 51:41.320]  spring particularly I stop three times with a squeegee and gas stations and
[51:41.320 --> 51:46.680]  clean the dead bugs off and the radiators just covered with dead bugs no
[51:46.680 --> 51:59.320]  bugs no bugs no bugs if the bugs are dying what's that mean see they're not
[51:59.320 --> 52:03.520]  just killing the evil humans we've all been taught today how bad we are how
[52:03.520 --> 52:10.520]  guilty we are turn our life force against ourselves they are killing the
[52:10.520 --> 52:19.400]  whole planet so here's national Spanish news
[52:19.400 --> 52:26.480]  buzz in the Korea the Spanish meteorological agency has confessed the
[52:26.480 --> 52:33.120]  Spain is being sprayed with lead dioxide silver iodine and diatomite and
[52:33.120 --> 52:38.880]  it and more and it goes on to say that they are spraying with UN
[52:38.880 --> 52:45.600]  authorization in the and in the EU biocides
[52:46.320 --> 52:54.960]  biocides and look up biocides a pesticide that kills life and they say in
[52:54.960 --> 53:02.360]  the press release that's right here in Spanish that it's being done to stop
[53:02.360 --> 53:08.640]  global warming so pesticides stop global warming oh but wait it gets better
[53:08.640 --> 53:29.520]  it gets a lot better they go on to say that it's also to stop COVID and there's
[53:29.520 --> 53:34.960]  another little problem here they talk in documents about stopping COVID in
[53:34.960 --> 53:45.320]  2019 that's their cover for the whole thing I suggest you go read it here's
[53:45.320 --> 53:49.980]  Reuters geoengineering marks scientific gain in UN report on dire climate
[53:49.980 --> 53:54.800]  future only this can save us but don't debate it while it's been going on for
[53:54.800 --> 53:59.440]  decades secretly controversial spraying method aims to curb a little warming CBS
[53:59.440 --> 54:07.000]  news and then we have House Republicans introduced climate change strategy with
[54:07.000 --> 54:11.040]  eye on midterms oh they admit it's real but they've got a better way to cut the
[54:11.040 --> 54:18.360]  evil carbon dioxide that plants breathe it is a declaration of war against the
[54:18.360 --> 54:23.200]  building blocks of all life on this planet carbon-based life forms and the
[54:23.200 --> 54:31.440]  carbon cycle of sunlight water carbon dioxide and oxygen and you take out
[54:31.440 --> 54:37.280]  carbon dioxide and you collapse the planet I can pull up headlines see an
[54:37.280 --> 54:41.920]  end scientists call for cutting down trees to stop carbon because they put
[54:41.920 --> 54:52.040]  off carbon dioxide those damn trees and now if you're a new listener part of
[54:52.040 --> 54:54.920]  the establishment or want to be part of the establishment you pretend you're
[54:54.920 --> 55:00.160]  part of the establishment do you really think you're safe going along with this
[55:00.160 --> 55:05.600]  power special you really think you're part of the winning team because it's
[55:05.600 --> 55:09.560]  not just this it's the human animal hybrids it's all the new viruses they're
[55:09.560 --> 55:13.520]  creating it's everything these mad scientists are doing playing God and
[55:13.520 --> 55:19.000]  they believe that they have to collapse not just civilization and not just
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.520]  humans but everything else and out of this great evolutionary struggle you're
[55:24.520 --> 55:27.680]  getting the big secret of their transhumanist cult right now most
[55:27.680 --> 55:31.440]  important thing in the world do you care like you like you know we're not just
[55:31.440 --> 55:37.520]  next year's news today you're getting everything here God believes in you I
[55:37.520 --> 55:43.480]  believe in you believe in yourself research this know it and then take
[55:43.480 --> 55:48.320]  control of our government's legal and lawfully and stop this they don't want
[55:48.320 --> 55:52.600]  us debating it when they start the project 30 years ago they say it doesn't
[55:52.600 --> 55:56.240]  exist while they started announcing it exists till they just normalize it and
[55:56.240 --> 56:01.120]  so what yeah they're spraying something yeah I got cancer yeah my sperm counts
[56:01.120 --> 56:05.520]  gone yeah I can't have babies yeah I got Parkinson's yeah the diseases are all
[56:05.520 --> 56:11.880]  exploding yeah yeah yeah last year FDA says no comment needed to the public no
[56:11.880 --> 56:17.200]  research done it's not in our regulatory capacity we're just busy shutting down
[56:17.200 --> 56:22.200]  my baby formula plans to even look at what unlimited
[56:22.200 --> 56:28.400]  nanotech is being sprayed in the food and water and they just say yeah you can
[56:28.400 --> 56:33.700]  do it they're hitting us in the sky they're hitting us in the food they're
[56:33.700 --> 56:36.360]  hitting us in the soil they're hitting us in the water they're hitting it
[56:36.360 --> 56:40.240]  psychologically they're hitting us with 5g they're hitting us spiritually they're
[56:40.240 --> 56:43.840]  hitting us with a cultural propaganda they're hitting us hitting us
[56:43.840 --> 56:46.840]  hitting us hitting us but instead of being victims of

[56:56.760 --> 57:03.400]  and I want God to come into me and energize me to oppose this and resist this and give me the discernment that means the
[57:04.600 --> 57:11.080]  Intelligence to say no to this and overcome it and God will answer you
[57:11.080 --> 57:18.360]  But you have to believe in God and stretch your arms out like the rune of life
[57:19.520 --> 57:25.360]  Peace is the dead tree death. Love how they call peace the death room the rune of life life

[57:32.000 --> 57:37.000]  I'm your son. I'm your daughter help me help me help me. I'm ready

[58:45.640 --> 58:47.800]  Thanks for being part of the tip of the spear
[58:50.360 --> 58:52.680]  Our world is so full of hide
[58:53.440 --> 58:59.760]  We are force-fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media by the controlled churches in the universities
[58:59.760 --> 59:03.920]  And why is this the case because we innately by God?
[59:04.560 --> 59:07.920]  Have been given the keys for our own minds our own psyches our own souls
[59:08.440 --> 59:15.320]  And by connection to God we can empower ourselves and trend send the quote fallen or sinful state
[59:15.960 --> 59:22.480]  So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to change who we are
[59:22.480 --> 59:29.440]  Are only lowering us. They're only making us work for us and the end. They're only making us less fulfilled. It is only by going
[59:29.440 --> 59:33.280]  Within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves
[59:33.760 --> 59:40.800]  That's why the globalist bombard us with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements
[59:40.800 --> 59:46.000]  Our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension
[59:46.000 --> 59:52.320]  And that's where the incredible products come in and in four store.com
[59:53.080 --> 59:55.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:55.920 --> 1:00:25.720]  So things are going so poorly for the White House that even NBC News can no longer ignore it vote for Biden
[1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:33.440]  He's an adult not anymore. Here's the line from NBC quote Biden is rattled by his sinking approval ratings
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:42.720]  There are signs of managerial breakdowns at the White House NBC also reports that Biden is furious that his aides keep walking back his demented comments quote
[1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:46.160]  Biden was furious his remarks were being seen as unreliable
[1:00:47.280 --> 1:00:48.720]  I wonder why
[1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:52.320]  Is he repeatedly declares war on various countries and that's just the beginning
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:57.520]  Politico no publication is sucked up to Biden harder than Politico
[1:00:57.760 --> 1:01:04.640]  But Politico is reporting that the Biden White House is a wash in malignant white supremacy. Are you surprised?
[1:01:04.720 --> 1:01:12.560]  Not really of course quote at least 21 black stappers have left the Biden White House since late last year or are planning to leave soon
[1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:19.280]  The sources blame the quote work environment in other words the racism of the Biden administration
[1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:26.720]  So things have gotten very bad for Joe Biden both public facing and internally. What are they doing about it? Well
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:33.920]  They broke glass in case for emergency and invited a Korean pop group to speak at the White House today watch
[1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:42.080]  I repeat yes, and it is a great honor to be invited to the White House today to discuss the important issues of anti-Asian hate crimes
[1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:44.400]  Asian inclusion diversity
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:52.000]  Yeah, so we got a Korean pop group to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes in the United States
[1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:58.800]  Okay, good job guys. There's no apollic points out quote the Biden administration is defending anti-Asian racial discrimination
[1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:04.240]  In university admissions in a case before the Supreme Court in case you wanted to compare substance versus PR
[1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:10.160]  It's not even very good PR. This is not even the first time the Biden administration has done something like this last August
[1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:15.040]  They invited a TikTok start of the White House because that'll make things better
[1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:20.560]  Hi, my name is Cooper and this is a day in my life as a White House intern
[1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:24.400]  We did a joke
[1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:26.240]  Hey everyone
[1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:30.720]  Hey Jenny, I booked you an ill appointment. Love. Yeah, I didn't tell you to do that. It's called initiative
[1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:34.160]  Hi White House is super. Hmm. I don't think so
[1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:40.080]  Yep, they hate the country trying to degrade it and it's working
[1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:45.200]  But the headline here is that the white supremacy in the biden White House is so intense
[1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:49.840]  21 black staffers can there be more than 21 total?
[1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:54.480]  Not a huge staff at the White House. 21 black staffers have fled
[1:02:55.280 --> 1:02:57.040]  Speaking of the new Jim Crow
[1:02:57.040 --> 1:03:01.120]  Candace Owens is the founder of the charity black sit. She's probably not surprised for this. She joins us tonight
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:04.800]  Candace, are you surprised that the racism the white supremacy
[1:03:05.600 --> 1:03:09.120]  At the White House is so intense that black staffers are fleeing for their lives
[1:03:11.040 --> 1:03:15.200]  I have to say I'm a little bit upset that I'm not involved in these strategy sessions at the White House
[1:03:15.280 --> 1:03:20.720]  I just picture them all sitting around a table and just quick quick black people are waking up and they're not happy
[1:03:20.960 --> 1:03:23.280]  Grab me an asian and put them in front of the podium
[1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:26.480]  We've got to shift here and shift yours completely on the PR strategy
[1:03:26.480 --> 1:03:30.320]  I mean, this is this is actually what they're doing right because black Americans first and foremost
[1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:35.040]  What's happening parallel to this is black Americans are waking up to the lie that was black lives matter
[1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:39.680]  So at the same time you're having these black Americans that were quite literally just given these positions
[1:03:39.920 --> 1:03:42.800]  They weren't meant to do anything. They never wanted them to actually do anything
[1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:47.440]  They probably were under qualified for the positions that they even had but the idea was oh look
[1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:51.680]  We're getting underneath literally if you're Nancy Pelosi to the black lives matter narrative, right?
[1:03:51.680 --> 1:03:56.560]  Remember she did that that notorious bow and got down on one knee and we're going to do this and show you that
[1:03:56.560 --> 1:04:00.160]  We're going to hire a bunch of black people, but we don't actually care what they think
[1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:05.280]  We just need them to be sit there and be black now the black Americans in the white house who are waking up and going
[1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:09.520]  You know what that's not okay with me and they're frantically searching to find up
[1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:15.600]  Drum up a new narrative of hate and this one's going to be asian american asian lives matter quick grab me kpop
[1:04:15.920 --> 1:04:19.120]  And hopefully america is going to fall for this when in reality
[1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:25.040]  We're focused on the gas prices the inflation prices and it's just an absolute complete joke
[1:04:25.040 --> 1:04:30.720]  Is there anything more destructive than white liberal guilt? It feels like it's hurt more people than nuclear weapons
[1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:36.000]  It really has and and people are starting to see that even patrice colors, right?
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.720]  But the person who started black lives matters basically said well
[1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:41.520]  It's not my fault that you guys gave me your white guilty dollars
[1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:46.160]  And I lied about what I did with it and bought myself an entire real estate empire and that's the truth
[1:04:46.160 --> 1:04:49.760]  So it's not just black americas. I need to have an awakening. It's white americans
[1:04:49.920 --> 1:04:54.640]  You know you have to stop allowing people to manipulate you emotionally and tell you that you're a bad person
[1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:56.640]  It's because you're born a story color

[1:05:56.800 --> 1:06:11.440]  Live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide, it's alex jones
[1:06:27.680 --> 1:06:29.680]  So we just did
[1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:33.040]  Almost all the first hour on
[1:06:33.680 --> 1:06:40.080]  The eu the un the spanish government releasing documents going. Hey, we're spraying pesticides in the jet fuel on you and your family
[1:06:40.240 --> 1:06:42.080]  It's to stop covid
[1:06:42.080 --> 1:06:44.080]  what
[1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:49.120]  It attacks and kills basically all life it comes in contact with it builds up in your body and kills you slowly
[1:06:50.080 --> 1:06:52.160]  Want an incredible first hour if you just tuned in
[1:06:52.160 --> 1:06:58.560]  We'll archive it later to band-aid video and your life quite frankly depends on you getting that information
[1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:01.920]  And getting it out. You know, we have lots of meat potatoes
[1:07:02.720 --> 1:07:07.840]  Stories here that will be really interesting and really informative at one level. Oh hunter biden
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:13.840]  Was searching for kitty porn online that's come out now in the documents
[1:07:14.800 --> 1:07:17.680]  He's on the videos and the photos having sex with his niece
[1:07:17.680 --> 1:07:19.680]  Oh
[1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:22.800]  In the documents he's sending his dad stuff
[1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:28.400]  We already know that biden was put in as a puppet to take the blame for the great reset
[1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:32.160]  And i hate biden and i hope he gets impeached and i wanted to be removed
[1:07:32.160 --> 1:07:36.800]  But we need to say get rid of your puppet not oh biden did all this now
[1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:42.000]  We have democrat politicians blaming biden. We had the federal reserve blaming biden. We have i told you this was coming
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:48.320]  It's biden. It's biden. It's biden. They put him in there because he was dumb enough to take the fall for all this not dumb enough
[1:07:49.520 --> 1:07:51.520]  seen all enough
[1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:54.960]  But where the rubber really means the road
[1:07:56.400 --> 1:08:00.400]  Because it's more academic being sprayed with chemicals or being given a poison shot
[1:08:01.600 --> 1:08:03.600]  But when you can't go to the grocery store
[1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:06.720]  And you can't get baby formula
[1:08:07.120 --> 1:08:08.960]  And we learned that when biden got in a year ago
[1:08:08.960 --> 1:08:15.360]  They started shutting down baby formula manufacturers and you ask why are they doing it why have now over 70 food processing plants?
[1:08:15.920 --> 1:08:17.920]  In the last 60 70 days burned down
[1:08:18.480 --> 1:08:22.240]  And you look at all the other policies to shut us down all the other policies destroy us
[1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:26.240]  They're destroying the industrial society
[1:08:28.240 --> 1:08:34.480]  The extinction rebellion you see all over the news blocking highways and factories and bus stations and train stations
[1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:37.040]  That's just their public pr arm
[1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:39.040]  That's their grassroots
[1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:41.440]  Astro turf that they pay for
[1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:47.440]  So we've got some clips here and then we'll get to the economy in general and the hybrid inflation
[1:08:48.400 --> 1:08:50.400]  JP Morgan CEO
[1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:54.960]  Says a hurricane's coming for the U.S economy brace yourself. That's like a fox
[1:08:56.400 --> 1:08:58.880]  Abby's already gone and eaten half the chickens one night
[1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:02.160]  Saying hey, you know what the rest of chickens are about to get eaten
[1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:06.160]  But here is the new white house press secretary
[1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:08.640]  Talk about a political suicide mission
[1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:13.120]  Talking about the baby formula
[1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:18.480]  She says we did everything we could for the moment that we learned of the recall
[1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:22.320]  The recall they ordered
[1:09:22.880 --> 1:09:27.520]  But it's bigger than that. It's the societal breakdown. It's not just one company. It's not just three. It's dozens
[1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:30.480]  and then
[1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:34.000]  And then they say was someone called the white house
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:42.640]  And she can't get her story straight with biden who says yeah, we were called last year, but I wasn't told says biden
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:45.360]  So let's just play clip one through three back to back
[1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:50.960]  We did everything that we can from the moment that we learned about the recall
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:53.200]  to to
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:56.720]  To work 24 seven to to make sure that the production went up
[1:09:56.720 --> 1:10:02.240]  I guess that just doesn't address the question of why it was that the president didn't know
[1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:09.440]  When the manufacturers are saying that they knew as soon as the recalls happened as soon as the plant was shut down
[1:10:09.440 --> 1:10:11.440]  That this would be a very serious problem
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.400]  Was there a breakdown in the process here? Did somebody fail to inform him?
[1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:21.440]  Look, I have not spoken to the president. I know that he just said that a few moments ago
[1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:26.800]  Uh, so I would have to uh, I would have to talk to him about about the april date
[1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:29.040]  But what I can tell you is
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:34.480]  What he has seen and this I know for certain is that seeing the empty shelves is unacceptable
[1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:40.320]  Seeing what families are going through is unacceptable. This is why we have been working 24 seven
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:46.560]  To make sure that we are using every lever at our disposal to deliver for the american people
[1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:50.240]  That is what I know for sure that I can share with you at this moment
[1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:55.600]  Uh, and uh, and that's how we're going to you know, going to continue to move to make sure that
[1:10:55.840 --> 1:10:57.840]  We're doing everything that we can and beyond
[1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:04.320]  So you did February 17th with the recall, February 18th FDA issued uh instructions to states
[1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:08.240]  Let's let's can we continue that through april?
[1:11:08.880 --> 1:11:14.320]  When did somebody call the white house to say this is a problem you guys may need to
[1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:16.720]  Get involved
[1:11:16.720 --> 1:11:23.280]  So I could say that um, again the recall happened on the day one of the recall we took action as a
[1:11:23.920 --> 1:11:27.680]  Whole of government approach, right with fda usda as I just laid out
[1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:34.000]  Um, and the president understands again. He understands how difficult this is he understands
[1:11:34.480 --> 1:11:37.920]  Uh, how challenging this is and we have acknowledged that
[1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:43.360]  He understands that this is the job of the president to be able to multitask to get things done
[1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:48.320]  Okay, he understands. He understands. He's carrying out the great reset the
[1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:52.960]  Transition cutting off the power cutting off the oil cutting off the pipelines
[1:11:53.680 --> 1:11:58.160]  He understands now though. We have a compilation of them denying this six months ago
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:01.360]  We have a compilation of them saying inflation didn't exist
[1:12:01.760 --> 1:12:06.080]  That inflation was good and well now inflation somebody else's fault. Let's continue
[1:12:06.080 --> 1:12:13.360]  When it comes to making sure that your child gets a healthy healthy food
[1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:18.800]  And so that is what is that is what we've been doing with someone called here at the white house to say
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:21.840]  This could be an issue that requires that it's involved
[1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:25.920]  So I don't have the timeline on that all I can tell you as a whole of government
[1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:29.520]  Approach we have been working on this since the recall in february
[1:12:29.520 --> 1:12:35.920]  Independent regulatory agency the FDA the one the questions have been referred to in the past is now being embraced as whole government
[1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:52.160]  All right, we've been having some track-caster problems with these videos we pull in we've got to check them before we play them
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:58.080]  They've been doing that but but biden went on to say I don't think anyone anticipated
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:00.400]  We'll put it in post we download it and give it to them
[1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:07.840]  I don't think anyone anticipated the impact of the shutdown of Abbott facility that they ordered
[1:13:09.840 --> 1:13:14.480]  So again, why is this so important?
[1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:18.880]  Because it's part of their operation. It's part of what they're doing
[1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:23.520]  Training you not to have food training. You're not to have water training. You're not to have electricity training
[1:13:23.520 --> 1:13:26.400]  You can't have a car training. You can't have air conditioning training
[1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:28.640]  You don't have a job training you that you're not essential
[1:13:29.360 --> 1:13:33.920]  And then they sit there and act like they don't know why it's happening imagine being the idiots
[1:13:34.480 --> 1:13:36.480]  That sign on in the by-demonstration
[1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:43.920]  Actually believing they're part of a winning team when they're the fall guys and the scapegoats for what the new world order is doing
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:49.920]  Thank god Tucker Carlson and joe rogan and all these senators get it down or saying it's the un
[1:13:50.240 --> 1:13:52.720]  It's the wef. It's the big corporations
[1:13:52.720 --> 1:14:00.320]  They're the ones doing this to shut down society to collapse it to consolidate control to then carry out their transhumanist
[1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:08.960]  Operations jp morgan ceo says hurricane is coming for the u.s economy brace yourself
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:16.480]  Fuel and food inflation crisis all stem from globalist policies excellent article from zero hedge
[1:14:16.480 --> 1:14:22.480]  Jp sees oil rising 136 this month depending on what china does
[1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:27.120]  As major traders bet millions on crude
[1:14:28.480 --> 1:14:31.280]  Explosion of $200 a barrel all-time high
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.800]  oil little change ever opec agrees to boost output
[1:14:35.440 --> 1:14:40.480]  Looming price hikes on foods set to hit americans even harder this fall
[1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:46.080]  And then the un put out a press release saying oh, they have a solution to global crisis
[1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:50.480]  It's all russia's fault when it's worldwide inflation is the lion chair of it
[1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:55.280]  farm inflation prices surges on chickens eggs wheat corn and milk
[1:14:56.080 --> 1:14:56.960]  all
[1:14:56.960 --> 1:15:02.640]  by design government officials blame biden for inflationary surge hurting most americans
[1:15:03.200 --> 1:15:08.800]  Because then he gets the blame and the new world order and the debauches group don't get the blame they
[1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:12.400]  They get to pose as the saviors
[1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:16.800]  And I keep going back to that they will continue to shut down civilization
[1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:25.440]  They will continue to implode the borders. They will continue to carry out their operations as long as they're not getting the blame
[1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:27.840]  exposing who the enemy is
[1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:30.400]  The type of attack we're under
[1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:33.760]  That's critical to them stopping it's a very
[1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:36.480]  simple equation

[1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:11.280]  Fortune and money magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year 30 different tax returns 30 different answers
[1:19:11.680 --> 1:19:16.000]  50 different tax returns 50 different answers and almost all of them just
[1:19:16.560 --> 1:19:21.280]  Screw you over especially the big firms and the big tax groups because they're part of the system
[1:19:21.280 --> 1:19:24.640]  And they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this show
[1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:29.440]  So very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:32.000]  to be able to
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:35.760]  Do things tax wise. It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep on your money
[1:19:35.760 --> 1:19:40.080]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years
[1:19:41.200 --> 1:19:44.560]  The only way you fail is not writing down the url
[1:19:44.720 --> 1:19:54.880]  jonestaxrelief.com one word jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-904-285 833-904-285
[1:19:54.880 --> 1:20:03.840]  You're listening to the alex joneshow
[1:20:25.520 --> 1:20:32.080]  So a private corporate world government that would make Hitler blush
[1:20:33.760 --> 1:20:35.760]  Is in control of the planet right now
[1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:42.160]  And you you can deny this is going on or you can see the documents in their own statements yourself and decide to not go along with it
[1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:46.080]  But let's look at what's currently happening
[1:20:47.040 --> 1:20:50.320]  With the attempt to take over our bodies and our bodily autonomy
[1:20:50.320 --> 1:20:55.840]  And to say the system owns our bodies with a shot that isn't a vaccine that was experimental
[1:20:56.080 --> 1:20:58.240]  That was given waivers that doesn't work
[1:20:59.280 --> 1:21:04.560]  In the way they say it does. Oh, it certainly works the other ways to turn off your immune system ahead of the next attack
[1:21:05.520 --> 1:21:11.840]  Pfizer asked FDA to authorize its COVID vaccine for children from six months to four years old
[1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:17.200]  Which will then give them liability protection from all the lawsuits
[1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:25.680]  Report hunter biden linked ukraine bio labs worked with COVID-19 research three months before the pandemic began a kelin green article
[1:21:26.800 --> 1:21:28.800]  so incredible and that's in the
[1:21:29.600 --> 1:21:36.640]  Wuhan lab documents as well that months before they were calling it COVID-19 and they had it and it was genetically engineered
[1:21:37.040 --> 1:21:39.040]  This is from the dod
[1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:43.440]  Absolutely bombshell. We just spent four hours on that alone
[1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:46.000]  Another big report by paul joseph watson
[1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:51.760]  COVID restrictions are coming back. They're getting them all ready. They just gave you a respite to kill political will
[1:21:52.640 --> 1:21:56.640]  And then they're going to bring it all back ladies and gentlemen, and then I've got this clip
[1:21:57.920 --> 1:21:59.920]  We're going to play next segment
[1:22:00.640 --> 1:22:02.880]  Fauci openly admits
[1:22:02.880 --> 1:22:11.440]  Biden mass mandate is about preserving authority
[1:22:15.440 --> 1:22:20.880]  Imagine that oh we want the power to do this wherever we want. That's why we're bringing it back
[1:22:22.560 --> 1:22:24.560]  And the same interview he announced he's going to be
[1:22:24.880 --> 1:22:29.120]  Stepping down soon because he's been politically destroyed and no longer useful for them
[1:22:29.120 --> 1:22:35.360]  After he ran the AIDS operation the HIV operation and so much more. That's the start of the next segment
[1:22:35.680 --> 1:22:36.880]  and then I will
[1:22:36.880 --> 1:22:39.840]  go to your phone calls greg tristan jacob
[1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:41.680]  toby
[1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:43.680]  Dominic anthony and others very
[1:22:44.480 --> 1:22:46.480]  important clip right there
[1:22:47.280 --> 1:22:49.040]  Stop the spread
[1:22:49.040 --> 1:22:52.640]  By not having sex says the uk of monkeypox is basically
[1:22:53.280 --> 1:22:54.640]  non-existence
[1:22:54.640 --> 1:23:01.920]  Negative vaccine effectiveness the fact checks were wrong. They weren't wrong. They lied on purpose last autumn and they're even more wrong now
[1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:06.240]  Says the daily skeptic laying out the actual statistics and numbers
[1:23:07.360 --> 1:23:12.160]  Big interview yesterday. It's a band-aute video that needs to be seen if you missed it and shared
[1:23:12.800 --> 1:23:17.600]  Economist whistleblower who predicted covet attorney breaks down how to fight the next lockdown
[1:23:17.600 --> 1:23:26.800]  U.S. Census data skewed in favor of democrats rigging future elections. We've got more on that coming up as well
[1:23:27.360 --> 1:23:32.880]  So when we see stories like crackhead milf and incest porn hunter biden search has revealed
[1:23:33.120 --> 1:23:36.160]  He texas his dad the porn home porn hub link
[1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:38.320]  to his
[1:23:38.320 --> 1:23:39.920]  profile
[1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:41.920]  Yeah, that's red meat for everybody
[1:23:42.880 --> 1:23:44.880]  But what does it do to stop nuclear war?
[1:23:44.880 --> 1:23:49.200]  You know a lot of people are asking me. Why aren't you covering the johnny depp verdict?
[1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:52.240]  Of course she lied of course
[1:23:53.120 --> 1:23:54.480]  the anti
[1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:56.480]  civil liberties union was involved in it
[1:23:57.120 --> 1:24:02.080]  Great for johnny depp the anti gun guy that said he hopes trumps assassinated not against johnny depp
[1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:05.040]  It's just that it's a diversion
[1:24:05.280 --> 1:24:11.760]  And a distraction from all the actual real serious things that are going on in this world
[1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:17.600]  And what the globalists have planned for us and our families
[1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:22.720]  But when we look at the entire depopulation agenda
[1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:26.320]  That is unfolding
[1:24:26.320 --> 1:24:28.820]  Everybody makes a joke out of it. I want to play a few minutes
[1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:31.520]  from
[1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:33.360]  bill mars last show
[1:24:33.360 --> 1:24:35.920]  Where he shows the statistics of one percent of people
[1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:38.800]  identified as homosexual
[1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:40.880]  in the 1940s
[1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:42.880]  And now with children
[1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:44.480]  It's approaching half
[1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:47.840]  In blue cities and control areas. What does that do?
[1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:55.120]  Because david hog famously made the joke jones is against gay frogs wrong gay frogs. Well gay frogs don't have any more frogs. They die
[1:24:56.160 --> 1:24:58.400]  So it's why are the globalists doing this?
[1:24:59.200 --> 1:25:04.160]  Well, they're selling depopulation as a political movement and it's something cool and fun
[1:25:04.560 --> 1:25:07.920]  So you don't notice why you're sterilized and why you can't have children
[1:25:07.920 --> 1:25:15.200]  Plus it won't matter because you don't want the responsibility of children or a future. You are just partying while the world burns
[1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:22.560]  And so even bill mar a few weeks ago said why is it democrat areas are half
[1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:25.360]  Transgender or half gay?
[1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:32.080]  Why is it in the red areas because it's political and its children being targeted with a sexual
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:34.800]  Agenda so play a few minutes
[1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:42.560]  Of bill mar go to break come back hit this fouchy clip and go to your phone calls here today. I'm alex jones stay with us
[1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:49.760]  And finally new rule of something about the human race is changing at a previously unprecedented rate
[1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:52.480]  We have to at least discuss it
[1:25:52.880 --> 1:25:59.840]  Broken down over time the lgbt population of america seems to be roughly doubling every generation
[1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:02.480]  According to a recent gala poll
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:07.840]  Less than 1 percent of americans born before 1946. That's joe biden's generation
[1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:18.080]  Identify that way 2.6 percent of boomers do 4.2 percent of gen x 10.5 percent of millennials and 20.8 percent of gen z
[1:26:18.080 --> 1:26:32.640]  Which means if we follow this trajectory, we will all be gay in 2050
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:37.440]  And then who's going to buy this chair
[1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:46.240]  I'm just saying that when things change this much this fast people are allowed to ask what's up with that
[1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:49.600]  All the babies are in the wrong bodies
[1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:55.360]  Was there a mix-up at the plant like with captain crunches oops all berries
[1:26:55.360 --> 1:27:09.600]  It wasn't that long ago when adults asked the kid what do you want to be when you grow up they meant what profession
[1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:21.680]  In the wake of america about to lose abortion rights the aclu
[1:27:21.680 --> 1:27:30.000]  Recently tweeted a list of those who would be disproportionately harmed by this you would think women might top that list
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:35.120]  No, wasn't even on the list second on the list was lgbt really?
[1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:39.280]  Abortion rights affects gay and trans people more than
[1:27:40.080 --> 1:27:42.080]  You know breeders
[1:27:45.040 --> 1:27:50.320]  I'm happy for lgbt folks that we now live in an age where they can live their authentic lives
[1:27:50.320 --> 1:27:54.720]  Openly and we should always be mindful of respecting and protecting
[1:27:55.520 --> 1:27:58.240]  But summer needs to say it not everything's about you
[1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:10.720]  And it's okay to ask questions about something that's very new and involves children
[1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:18.640]  The answer can't always be that anyone from a marginalized community is automatically right trump card mic drop end of discussion
[1:28:18.640 --> 1:28:21.760]  Because we're literally experimenting on children
[1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:27.040]  Maybe that's why sweden and finland have stopped giving puberty blockers to kids
[1:28:27.600 --> 1:28:34.080]  Because we just don't know much about the long-term effects although common sense should tell you that when you reverse the course
[1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:37.600]  Of raging hormones. There's going to be problems
[1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:48.320]  We do know it hinders the development of bone density, which is kind of important if you like having a skeleton
[1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:56.080]  Fertility and the ability to have an orgasm seem also to be affected. This isn't just a lifestyle decision
[1:28:56.160 --> 1:29:02.160]  It's medical the first 10 amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791
[1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:09.680]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press free speech means the free and public
[1:29:10.240 --> 1:29:15.680]  Expression of opinions without censorship interference and restraint by the government
[1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:22.400]  231 years later free speech across america is under chronic and insidious attack
[1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:29.680]  GCN is under attack your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not want you to know the truth

[1:29:55.920 --> 1:30:05.360]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans. They financed major universities. They ran full page
[1:30:05.760 --> 1:30:07.520]  stories and
[1:30:07.520 --> 1:30:10.960]  Advertisements pushing their propaganda of the new york times other major newspapers
[1:30:11.520 --> 1:30:13.840]  That the family as we know it is a bad thing
[1:30:14.480 --> 1:30:19.440]  It must be ended and the first step in that is getting women out of the household teaching
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:24.880]  Women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing
[1:30:24.880 --> 1:30:27.440]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:32.480]  For my daughter my four national daughter. My wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make this well
[1:30:32.480 --> 1:30:33.920]  I love to make breakfast
[1:30:33.920 --> 1:30:38.160]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be
[1:30:38.720 --> 1:30:42.080]  And then all sit down together and have that communal event
[1:30:42.800 --> 1:30:50.560]  And that's what the system is the tasking and bombarded is our normal biological actions are coming together. They really are sick
[1:30:50.560 --> 1:30:57.520]  Evil scientific cult of filth and want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue
[1:30:58.080 --> 1:30:59.760]  I want to take a minute out

[1:33:21.040 --> 1:33:25.440]  All right, we're going to your phone calls here on the geo engineering last hour i covered it
[1:33:25.440 --> 1:33:28.400]  You in EU documents Spanish documents admit
[1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:34.000]  They're spraying to stop covid pesticides on you. Wow. What an announcement
[1:33:34.400 --> 1:33:37.280]  We showed you video clips of the CIA director and others admitting it all
[1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:42.240]  But I could play the whole 10 minute clip. We just played like three minutes of bill marre
[1:33:44.080 --> 1:33:47.680]  Where he's sitting there going these property blockers hurt children
[1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:52.320]  They make them sick. They stump their growth. They kill their bones. They ruin their sexual
[1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:56.800]  Uh a future they sterilize them. Why are we doing this?
[1:33:57.440 --> 1:34:00.640]  Well, it's the corporate world directing it all
[1:34:02.320 --> 1:34:06.400]  And we have the documents it's in the film in game promote homosexuality
[1:34:07.040 --> 1:34:09.600]  To depopulate we don't hate somebody
[1:34:10.720 --> 1:34:17.120]  Because of who they're attracted to or who they love they're an adult, but we do see the agenda being pushed here
[1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:25.360]  Here's a very powerful meme shows a c-130 full of coffins draped with american flags of dead servicemen and women coming home
[1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:28.960]  This is they get one day and it shows a bunch of men
[1:34:29.600 --> 1:34:32.000]  Big fat men dressed as clowns calling them women
[1:34:32.800 --> 1:34:34.800]  They get one month
[1:34:35.600 --> 1:34:38.400]  Corporate driven pride month relentlessly mocked
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:43.200]  With fabulous memes they don't care because they've got your children
[1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:48.160]  Bull finds most americans reject the idea of kids choosing preferred pronouns
[1:34:48.240 --> 1:34:52.320]  They're not teaching them reading rhyming and arithmetic or teaching them to be part of the sex cult
[1:34:53.920 --> 1:34:58.880]  U.S. Marines ridiculed it's not a joke. It's not a spoof on full metal jackets Stanley Kubrick
[1:34:59.200 --> 1:35:02.320]  U.S. Marines ridiculed over gay bullets tweet will shoot you
[1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:04.960]  with the rainbow
[1:35:05.360 --> 1:35:08.720]  Don't ask for Sadie's bins that were building from 1938 to 45
[1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:13.840]  Ask jack was so big as they don't do the rainbow ads in the middle east or other places
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:19.520]  But just here and of course for Sadie's was vending was building pans or tanks for the nazis
[1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:29.360]  MSM race vader claims fears over gun control are like resurgence of kkk the kkk didn't want black spill to be armed the nra
[1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:35.440]  Was founded ladies and gentlemen to train northerners and blacks how to own guns
[1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:39.280]  And how to shoot team made a transgender swimmer
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  Leah Thomas claims you pin
[1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:45.840]  Silence intimidated female swimmers who brought up concerns even have the letters
[1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:50.560]  So not just you have to accept a man competing as you got to shut your dirty pie hole
[1:35:51.120 --> 1:35:53.120]  You evil americans and meanwhile
[1:35:53.920 --> 1:36:00.240]  As the u.s. economy faces recession they engineered the global elites push ai babies to cut down on world
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:02.800]  population and it just gets
[1:36:02.800 --> 1:36:05.600]  More insane from there
[1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:08.400]  expert predicts ai
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:12.320]  Tech children will solve population problem. You'll have a virtual child
[1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:16.640]  Won't be as alive as your tia pet or even your pet rock
[1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:19.040]  But still that's what it is
[1:36:19.440 --> 1:36:21.440]  All right, let's go to this Fauci clip
[1:36:22.160 --> 1:36:28.800]  Saying the quiet part out loud that oh, biden's gone to the federal appeals court to reinstate the mask mandate on airplanes and other federal
[1:36:29.200 --> 1:36:31.040]  transportation like trains
[1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:33.360]  Because it's about power here it is
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:38.160]  So dr. We're at the same time the justice department is pushing appeals court to
[1:36:39.040 --> 1:36:45.200]  Intervene on this ruling that lifts mask mandates and public transportation mass transit that sort of thing
[1:36:45.680 --> 1:36:46.640]  uh
[1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:48.640]  What do you think of that?
[1:36:50.480 --> 1:36:53.840]  We are you asking me what I think about the justice department appealing
[1:36:54.720 --> 1:36:55.920]  this uh
[1:36:55.920 --> 1:36:58.640]  Court decision about pulling back exactly, uh
[1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:05.040]  You know one of the yeah one of the issues neil that I have I have articulated in the past and I will in the future
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:08.800]  It's less about mandates on the plane than it is about
[1:37:09.280 --> 1:37:14.560]  Who has the right and the authority and the capability of making public health decisions?
[1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:22.400]  And I believe that the department of justice is operating on the principle that decisions that are public health decisions
[1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:30.080]  belong with the public health agency in this case the cdc so it's more of a matter of principle of where the
[1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:34.720]  Authority lies than it is about whether or not there's going to be a mandate on a plane or not
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:38.480]  But do you personally dog? I mean when you travel and when you go around do you
[1:37:38.960 --> 1:37:43.440]  Prefer wearing a mask yourself. I know you've avoided public venues of large countrooms
[1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:50.000]  I think the white house correspondence dinner comes to mind. Uh, do you still have those reservations even now?
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:54.400]  Uh, yeah, I do. I mean the cdc continues to recommend
[1:37:54.640 --> 1:38:01.440]  That when people fly that they wear masks now the mandate has been pulled back on the decision of the court
[1:38:01.760 --> 1:38:05.440]  But that does not show that's enough shut him up recommendation of the cdc
[1:38:06.480 --> 1:38:12.400]  He needs to be in a super max president not on television. He engineered the virus with bill gates of peter dazik
[1:38:12.400 --> 1:38:18.720]  He launched an honest. He blocked therapeutics. He put sick people in nursing homes. The man is a monster
[1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:20.720]  I
[1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:26.640]  Couldn't kill that clip. I still hear foul to you mayor. Thanks. So
[1:38:29.280 --> 1:38:32.160]  Let's go to your phone calls right now ladies and gentlemen
[1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:37.120]  Let's take a caller from wisconsin kin kin. Thanks for calling
[1:38:39.440 --> 1:38:41.520]  Hello, alex. Can you hear me? I sure can
[1:38:42.480 --> 1:38:45.760]  super man, I'm glad you uh, you got the subject of uh
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:51.440]  A few engineering going on here in your program, you know, I've been on this for a long long time
[1:38:52.080 --> 1:38:54.960]  I just want to throw a couple of numbers at you if I may here
[1:38:55.600 --> 1:39:00.640]  You know, I've taken many samples of both rainwater and snow from up here in these parts
[1:39:01.280 --> 1:39:08.480]  And in the northern tier and sent these uh these samples off to uh non-government labs to have it analyzed
[1:39:08.800 --> 1:39:10.800]  I've done aluminum. I've done barium
[1:39:11.360 --> 1:39:13.120]  manganese
[1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:15.120]  and uh other tests
[1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:18.000]  And my latest from last year blew my mind
[1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:20.400]  Now I want to
[1:39:20.400 --> 1:39:24.560]  Mention to you that there's a reporting limit, especially say for aluminum or barium
[1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:27.280]  The reporting limit
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:31.680]  Anything over 100 parts per billion. I believe it's billion. I could be wrong
[1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:38.000]  Uh is to be reported uh to whom is to be reported at the epa. I'm not sure
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:40.560]  But I will tell you this
[1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:42.560]  It never changes other reporting limit
[1:39:42.800 --> 1:39:44.480]  100 parts per
[1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:47.840]  Last year came uh just on the aluminum results
[1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:50.400]  6200
[1:39:50.880 --> 1:39:54.160]  Uh, and this is in our breathing column that we breathe
[1:39:54.880 --> 1:40:01.760]  The barium was is 2.5 never changes always 2.5 anything over that to be reported
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:04.080]  It was that 91 parts per
[1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:07.840]  So this is in our air column and we're breathing this alexon
[1:40:08.160 --> 1:40:12.000]  And I know there's a lot of other people out there that know about this
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:17.120]  I've I've dug deep into it. I've I've picked up a book not too long ago
[1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:23.440]  By perty, uh, excuse me. Peter a Kirby on camp trails exposed a new Manhattan project
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:27.840]  Plenty of information on that too alex. Oh, yeah, there's a lot of great books and stuff
[1:40:27.840 --> 1:40:33.360]  But I mean it's admitted in the un documents last hour. We showed they're now putting pesticides on the spray
[1:40:33.920 --> 1:40:36.640]  So the researchers always debate whether it exists or not
[1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:43.600]  They do that as a way to keep us in a debate. It exists. Where is congress? Where are the governors? We need to expose this
[1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:51.920]  Yeah, absolutely. I mean this this is a taboo subject and you could be assured there are plenty plenty of folks
[1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:57.120]  In a position from senators to congressmen and women in in washington
[1:40:57.440 --> 1:40:59.360]  They know this is going on
[1:40:59.360 --> 1:41:05.040]  They do know it's going on because dade wiggagton and another friend they have had been out there at one time trying to
[1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:09.280]  Run this all through them and they just paid no attention to them whatsoever
[1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:15.360]  They just closed their little their little doors behind them and not to be discussed or disclosed
[1:41:15.440 --> 1:41:21.040]  It's a taboo subject and climate change. Yeah, it's real but it's coming from overhead
[1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:28.640]  It ain't coming from our cars and our motorcycles and our lawnmowers. That's a bunch of junk
[1:41:28.640 --> 1:41:35.200]  Beautifully says sir. Thank you. Yeah, I mean for people that just tuned in. I spent the whole first hour on this showing documents
[1:41:35.600 --> 1:41:38.000]  and news clips and all of it and it is admitted
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:43.280]  That they're spring not just aluminum dioxide barium salts other things on us. They're spring
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:47.600]  Biosides and they go. Oh, it's to stop COVID
[1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:50.480]  But there's no debate about it
[1:41:50.560 --> 1:41:54.880]  Instead they go. Oh, it doesn't exist. But you but they do press releases how they're doing it
[1:41:54.880 --> 1:42:01.520]  Then when we challenge it, they always make it a debate about whether it exists or not not about
[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:07.840]  Is it right what they're doing? This is how they play the game by critical race theory a year ago a year ago
[1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:12.480]  Corporate media said it doesn't exist. It's not happening
[1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:17.280]  And when folks expose it was happening they went, okay, here's the FBI
[1:42:17.280 --> 1:42:26.080]  You can't criticize it. So they never have a face-to-face debate. They never respect you and actually engage you in discussion
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:30.560]  They just deny it to your face while it's in all the public documents, and they're doing it
[1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:35.920]  Dominique and others your calls are straight ahead on the other side of this quick break
[1:42:36.320 --> 1:42:41.840]  I'm Alex Jones your host news wars.com info wars.com band out video a
[1:42:41.840 --> 1:42:49.040]  A revolutionary act to share that url and to share those videos and articles fan dot video
[1:42:49.840 --> 1:42:52.240]  We'll be right back on the other side. Stay with us
[1:42:57.120 --> 1:43:04.240]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex Jones was right people ask. What's it like to be vindicated?
[1:43:04.640 --> 1:43:08.160]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:14.720]  I tried to stop it and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever
[1:43:15.040 --> 1:43:20.160]  Because the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents
[1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:25.360]  It's now out in the open claus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:29.040]  The bill der berg group founded davos group. So now
[1:43:29.920 --> 1:43:31.520]  The fight's out in the open
[1:43:31.520 --> 1:43:35.600]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule. We're gonna win this thing
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:40.320]  God's watching the children counting on us. I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth
[1:43:40.720 --> 1:43:44.880]  And your prayer and your financial support because without you info wars would not be here
[1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:48.320]  So I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war
[1:43:48.720 --> 1:43:51.200]  And you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance
[1:43:51.440 --> 1:43:56.720]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts
[1:43:57.360 --> 1:44:03.520]  I don't care if you work in caviteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer or rancher a doctor a lawyer or a millionaire
[1:44:03.520 --> 1:44:10.160]  Fortune and money magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year 30 different tax returns 30 different answers
[1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:14.880]  50 different tax returns 50 different answers and almost all of them just
[1:44:15.440 --> 1:44:20.080]  Screw you over especially the big firms and the big tax groups because they're part of the system
[1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:23.520]  And they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this show
[1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:28.320]  So very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[1:44:29.040 --> 1:44:30.880]  to be able to
[1:44:30.880 --> 1:44:34.640]  Do things tax wise. It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your money
[1:44:34.640 --> 1:44:38.960]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years
[1:44:40.080 --> 1:44:47.680]  The only way you fail is not writing down the url jonestaxrelief.com one word jonestaxrelief.com or call
[1:44:48.080 --> 1:44:53.760]  833-940-285 833-940-285
[1:44:53.760 --> 1:45:06.560]  The globalist are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food
[1:45:06.560 --> 1:45:09.920]  It's all come out and they're doing that not because we're weak
[1:45:09.920 --> 1:45:13.600]  But because we're made the image of god the creator and we are
[1:45:14.160 --> 1:45:17.360]  Powerful and the social engineers fear that so much
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:22.800]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy
[1:45:22.800 --> 1:45:24.800]  Is it true?
[1:45:25.760 --> 1:45:29.520]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:31.600]  Was hopeless
[1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:35.920]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death
[1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:37.920]  because
[1:45:37.920 --> 1:45:42.800]  They know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world
[1:45:42.960 --> 1:45:47.840]  Who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever
[1:45:48.240 --> 1:45:50.240]  Because even you don't believe in god
[1:45:50.240 --> 1:45:57.040]  What the globalist are manifesting and setting up is japan and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast
[1:45:57.040 --> 1:45:58.480]  They just announced

[1:46:56.960 --> 1:47:07.440]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:16.320 --> 1:47:18.320]  It's a hurricane
[1:47:18.400 --> 1:47:21.280]  It's right now. It's kind of sunny things are doing fine
[1:47:21.280 --> 1:47:28.320]  You know everyone thinks they're the fed can handle this that hurricane is right out there down the road coming our way
[1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:33.760]  We just don't know if it's a minor one or super storm sandy or yeah sandy or
[1:47:34.240 --> 1:47:38.800]  Or uh, andrew or something like that and it's see you you better brace yourself
[1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:43.360]  So they've engineered the collabs they've done everything they could to do it
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:48.240]  And now their head generals are telling you to be your savior like when bill gates predicted
[1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:50.480]  the
[1:47:50.480 --> 1:47:52.480]  covid situation
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  We're on back to your phone calls right now
[1:47:56.400 --> 1:48:01.920]  Let's talk to dominique in chicago on the chemtrails the open announcements. What do you make of that dominique?
[1:48:02.800 --> 1:48:06.320]  Yeah, hi alex a long time listener have been listening since the late 90s
[1:48:06.800 --> 1:48:11.120]  Uh, just wanted to make a few points here. My parents immigrated from poland
[1:48:11.760 --> 1:48:15.680]  My grandparents came here from poland. I had videotapes from the 80s
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:21.680]  Of me playing in my backyard. The sky's always been crystal clear not a single chemtrail
[1:48:22.160 --> 1:48:28.240]  Sometimes starting in the late 80s 90s. They started spraying right over here. They spray on a schedule
[1:48:28.640 --> 1:48:30.640]  They start at 10 30 a.m
[1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:35.040]  And they're always high enough. They're always flying at a higher elevation
[1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:37.680]  Now if you take binoculars or a telescope
[1:48:38.240 --> 1:48:41.120]  The planes that are spraying are unmarked planes
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:46.400]  Whereas the regular planes flying at a lower altitude. They're all commercial planes
[1:48:47.040 --> 1:48:52.000]  So they're always spraying at a regular schedule and they take days off
[1:48:52.240 --> 1:48:56.960]  So the day before memorial day the day before labor day the day before new year's day
[1:48:57.440 --> 1:49:00.080]  They're they don't spray they have those days off
[1:49:00.640 --> 1:49:06.720]  And then my last point is that i'm very sensitive to my surroundings to the food I put in my body for what I drink
[1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:12.560]  Within hours of them spraying I get really tired and it happens to a lot of people and I notice
[1:49:12.880 --> 1:49:19.120]  The days that people are tired and they're not feeling good. I look up and lo and behold they've been spraying since 10 30
[1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:23.680]  Well, let me let me say this dominate, you know, I've been on system in 1990s covering this
[1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:27.840]  That before compensation trails didn't persist and then they did
[1:49:28.960 --> 1:49:33.200]  Almost no one I know fighting this goes. Oh, here's a un documenter
[1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:37.440]  Here's the former head of the CIA or here's the Spanish government
[1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:44.640]  Admitting they're doing it. And so we always just hey, I saw it. Hey, it's up there and I understand you're observing that but
[1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:47.360]  We need to codify
[1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:52.320]  What they're doing and show their own admissions when we debate this
[1:49:53.040 --> 1:49:58.480]  Because everybody I know just says hey, this didn't used to happen. Now it happens kids growing up never do it any different
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:04.800]  So does that make sense when I'm saying that we we have the documents. It's it's not like we're trying to prove it's happening
[1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:06.800]  They admit it's happening
[1:50:07.120 --> 1:50:11.840]  Yes, I agree. I agree. I mean there needs to be government commissions and committees looking into this and
[1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:17.520]  and contacting your your local authorities and your local politicians and telling them to look at this and
[1:50:17.840 --> 1:50:20.880]  They're asking questions and one last thing that I wanted to mention is that
[1:50:21.520 --> 1:50:23.520]  There are disney movie covers now
[1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:29.440]  Of different Pixar movies where the background guy is showing the chemtrails
[1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:32.800]  digitally inserted inserted into the actual
[1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:40.800]  Graphic of the movies so that they can get all the youth and all the kids watching the Pixar and disney movies to get them used to the chemtrails
[1:50:41.040 --> 1:50:44.400]  No, I agree. I agree and I appreciate your call. Dominic. Here's what I'm getting in
[1:50:45.280 --> 1:50:50.720]  We still have debates where the world government and the great reset exists. They're announcing. They're going to collapse things
[1:50:50.720 --> 1:50:53.840]  They're announcing you'll own nothing. They're announcing they're gonna have a world ID
[1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:58.480]  They're announcing they're taking your bodies over and we just keep having debates about whether it exists or not
[1:50:58.720 --> 1:51:03.040]  Because the corporate media says hey world government. Hey world ID. Oh, but it doesn't exist
[1:51:03.840 --> 1:51:07.120]  And so they keep us in this game. They keep us in this joke
[1:51:07.760 --> 1:51:14.080]  And I'm trying to develop how do we have an open debate about this to just say we know you're doing it
[1:51:14.080 --> 1:51:16.080]  You admit you're doing it now. Stop it
[1:51:16.080 --> 1:51:20.080]  Toby unless Virginia. Welcome Toby
[1:51:20.560 --> 1:51:26.720]  For having me uh first off just want to say thank you to everything you do and the people there at info wars greatly appreciate it all
[1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:32.000]  First off in regards to the chemtrails correct me if i'm wrong, but I'd love to hear your take on it
[1:51:32.160 --> 1:51:36.080]  I believe it's like a three phase thing as to where they control ph of the food
[1:51:36.480 --> 1:51:38.480]  They geoengineer seeds that are
[1:51:38.640 --> 1:51:41.680]  Resilient against aluminum and they control the food supply
[1:51:41.680 --> 1:51:46.000]  I also wonder if they're going to work in a way to have it work with vaccines and other types of
[1:51:46.400 --> 1:51:50.000]  Scenarios to where they can control illness. Uh, what do you think about those ideas?
[1:51:50.400 --> 1:51:54.560]  Well, they're not ideas. It's admitted that Monsanto 20 years ago came out
[1:51:54.560 --> 1:51:59.040]  They're developing everything for aluminum to resistant seeds where nobody else can grow but then yeah
[1:51:59.280 --> 1:52:04.560]  That's one phase of the operation while they give us Alzheimer's and neurological disorders and while they attack us
[1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:09.120]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. So how do we when it's all admitted
[1:52:09.120 --> 1:52:14.960]  Form a policy debate instead of debating whether it exists say here it is you admit you're doing it stop it
[1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:19.040]  You even heard the ci director go well people may look at the policy and get upset
[1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:22.720]  That's why we got to keep it secret, but they admit the secret programs going on
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:27.600]  Yeah, very true. I mean, I truthfully it makes me think about who's running it
[1:52:27.600 --> 1:52:30.240]  If it's going on all throughout the world all over countries
[1:52:30.640 --> 1:52:35.440]  Technically there's a clear and war an act of war on everybody because they're like you're saying they're trying to hurt
[1:52:35.440 --> 1:52:41.360]  All innocent people in certain areas and if that's affecting the whole world then obviously that's almost like a genocide type approach
[1:52:41.680 --> 1:52:44.560]  So technically people would be held accountable to law based on that
[1:52:45.040 --> 1:52:49.280]  I guess notion but as to figure out who's doing it. That's the main thing we need to figure out
[1:52:50.720 --> 1:52:52.720]  And again, we know who's doing it
[1:52:53.520 --> 1:52:55.040]  it's a
[1:52:55.040 --> 1:52:57.040]  united nations treaty
[1:52:58.240 --> 1:52:59.840]  carrying out
[1:52:59.840 --> 1:53:01.680]  this operation
[1:53:01.680 --> 1:53:03.680]  They admit it's being done
[1:53:03.680 --> 1:53:06.720]  under the treaty and we've covered the treaties
[1:53:07.280 --> 1:53:08.880]  And it's going on
[1:53:08.880 --> 1:53:13.520]  And so we're always at the level of debating whether it's happening or not while they simultaneously
[1:53:13.920 --> 1:53:16.720]  On the operation. Thank you so much. Toby beautiful points
[1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:19.280]  Anthony in florida. Anthony. Welcome
[1:53:21.440 --> 1:53:22.960]  Hey, Alex
[1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:27.600]  I just want to let you know that the wife and I send prayers over for you in the crew every night
[1:53:28.480 --> 1:53:31.440]  Um, we support the store as much as we can. Thank you
[1:53:31.440 --> 1:53:37.520]  And I'm over here in east florida and we got NASA over here in space force and
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  I'll tell you what man. It was like middle of may
[1:53:40.480 --> 1:53:46.080]  I was at work and I saw like white crystallized particles in the air one morning at work and I was like, yeah
[1:53:46.080 --> 1:53:50.160]  It's probably just allergies. No big deal. The next day. I got really sick
[1:53:51.040 --> 1:53:58.560]  Uh, I haven't been that sick since I got covid in february 2020. Well, you know the pentagon was approached by dazzling gates
[1:53:58.560 --> 1:54:05.680]  Um in 2017 and so we're going to spray aerosolized nanotech virus crystals of covid 19 everybody
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:10.080]  That's mainline news. So yeah, there's it's all they're spraying you brother
[1:54:10.960 --> 1:54:17.680]  That's absolutely this nasa. They they definitely do weather manipulation down here and um, I'm in my 30s
[1:54:17.680 --> 1:54:20.480]  You know, I take my vitamin d gummies all the time my x3
[1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:21.360]  So I'm healthy
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:25.440]  I worked out three days a week and I was like man if I was older this would probably have killed me
[1:54:25.440 --> 1:54:30.000]  And I work with an older gentleman. He hasn't been back to work. It's been two weeks and that's the plan
[1:54:30.080 --> 1:54:32.080]  I mean, it's to kill the boomers
[1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:34.400]  Yeah, everybody's sick man
[1:54:34.880 --> 1:54:39.280]  And I think it was because they I believe I really believe in my heart because they spray stuff here
[1:54:40.320 --> 1:54:43.040]  Well, sir, you don't need to believe in your heart. Did you see the first hour?
[1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:47.440]  Or are they all the documents in the un and the eu and the admissions of it?
[1:54:48.320 --> 1:54:50.320]  Of course, I watch every day, Alex
[1:54:50.320 --> 1:54:56.240]  Well, god bless you. I appreciate your call, Anthony. Let's take more calls. Let's talk to mike and texas mike here on the air
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:01.520]  Hey, good good subject. Just wanted to call in everything's local and you're right
[1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:08.960]  We don't have to uh, argue about whether it exists or not. For example, uh, the texas agricultural code title nine
[1:55:09.520 --> 1:55:14.960]  Chapter 302 right here in texas weather modification and control grant program
[1:55:14.960 --> 1:55:21.280]  Um, you know also the texas department of licensing and registration, believe it or not
[1:55:21.440 --> 1:55:28.960]  Is the is the control center. So if somebody wants to apply for a grant or do weather mods, they just have to go, uh
[1:55:29.600 --> 1:55:31.600]  Get a permit from the tdlr
[1:55:31.840 --> 1:55:37.040]  But you understand mike and that's a key point to make that weather mod is only one part they are spraying
[1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:43.360]  Bioside or anti-life chemicals on us in their own documents. I showed last hour
[1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:50.080]  No, I I completely get it. I I've been I've been on this topic for 13 or 14 years
[1:55:50.160 --> 1:55:53.520]  I just as a simple entry to get people off the fence
[1:55:54.160 --> 1:55:56.560]  We can start with this and move into that
[1:55:56.560 --> 1:55:58.960]  But what I'm saying is whether that we don't want to get it
[1:55:59.040 --> 1:56:03.360]  But let's let's fight them where we know we can and then bring up the other documents as well
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:05.360]  Maybe find a class section lawsuit
[1:56:05.360 --> 1:56:12.000]  So it's it's the texas agricultural code title nine chapter 302 in texas if we want to get started
[1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:21.840]  Where do you think this is going where they simultaneously admit it exists, but then simultaneously deny it so there's never a debate. How do we override that?
[1:56:23.280 --> 1:56:31.840]  You know, it's unfortunate everything that they've done to us so far as you well know as incrementalist and the more that that we we just
[1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:37.440]  It's there every day or the normalcy bias. We sit there and argue. I've had the same situation
[1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:40.720]  You know with family members as jets were going across the sky
[1:56:41.440 --> 1:56:45.840]  Creating an X and spreading and so forth. It's almost a Stockholm syndrome
[1:56:45.840 --> 1:56:53.840]  So my my point would be let's start at a local level to get people involved to say, hey, look, let's here's there's no debate
[1:56:53.840 --> 1:56:57.840]  Here's weather modification. Okay, but it's expanded into this
[1:56:57.840 --> 1:57:01.840]  Let's take that and rally around that because people don't know what to do
[1:57:01.840 --> 1:57:05.840]  We can all get upset and we can raise awareness and all this awareness
[1:57:05.840 --> 1:57:09.840]  We've got to take action and my point is if people could see it for themselves
[1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:15.840]  Even here locally in the state of texas and say holy crap that really does exist. They can do that
[1:57:15.840 --> 1:57:17.840]  That may start something and we may have a foundation
[1:57:17.840 --> 1:57:25.840]  No, I totally agree because they are hitting us with the injections the GMO the chemtrails all of it. Thank you so much Mike. All right
[1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:31.840]  More calls straight ahead our number three and a bunch of other critical news
[1:57:31.840 --> 1:57:39.840]  Straight ahead incredible information. You got to tune into that first hour when we broadcast and once it's posted a Band-Aid video
[1:57:39.840 --> 1:57:45.840]  We lay it all out there our number three straight ahead
[1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:57.840]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled
[1:57:57.840 --> 1:58:06.840]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their locks
[1:58:06.840 --> 1:58:12.840]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers
[1:58:12.840 --> 1:58:21.840]  Now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:24.840]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever
[1:58:24.840 --> 1:58:29.840]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover
[1:58:29.840 --> 1:58:38.840]  Like Canada where they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia
[1:58:38.840 --> 1:58:47.840]  So pray for these folks big time it's a very serious situation and stay tuned into infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount
[1:58:47.840 --> 1:58:53.840]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported info wars financially with word of mouth and prayer
[1:58:53.840 --> 1:59:01.840]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you
[1:59:01.840 --> 1:59:09.840]  Humanity has a real fighting chance. I just want to thank you all for buying products at infowars.com like books and films and supplements and water filtration

[2:00:01.840 --> 2:00:20.840]  They're a very powerful report by Greg Reese on how America can take back its nation in the world and then throughout the next hour we're taking your phone calls. Here's the report
[2:00:20.840 --> 2:00:38.840]  Perhaps the most evil display of deception and murder we are subjected to today are found in the new phenomenon of mass school shootings. Prior to 1999 they were practically nonexistent but today they have almost become predictable
[2:00:38.840 --> 2:00:46.840]  And if you are able to examine the evidence objectively without getting emotional, a pattern can be recognized
[2:00:46.840 --> 2:01:10.840]  Former naval intelligence officer turned whistleblower Milton William Cooper wrote in his book Behold a Pale Horse published in 1991 that the CIA was using drugs and hypnosis on mental patients in order to persuade them to open fire on schoolyards to inflame the anti-gun lobby and do away with the second amendment
[2:01:10.840 --> 2:01:24.840]  This probably sounds outlandishly evil and it is, but the evidence is there. In the Columbine shootings of 1999 we are told that Eric Harris and Dylan Clybalt acted alone
[2:01:24.840 --> 2:01:34.840]  The town of Columbine, Colorado was created in 1958 for families and employees of the military industrial complex
[2:01:34.840 --> 2:01:50.840]  Eric and Dylan were arrested a year prior to the shooting and were allegedly sodomized by the arresting officer which may sound crazy but a local officer admitted to raping informants which is a known method of trauma-based mind control
[2:01:50.840 --> 2:02:08.840]  After this January incident Eric and Dylan were put into a juvenile diversion program and prescribed SSRI drugs known to cause homicidal ideation. During this time Eric Harris was making online death threats and bomb threats
[2:02:08.840 --> 2:02:26.840]  Local police were aware of this and drafted a search warrant after David but it was ignored. Eric and Dylan threatened revenge for the January incident in their yearbook. They produced a school video about their plans and began openly collecting weapons
[2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:40.840]  All of this while on probation and nothing was done about it. During the shootings the police stood outside the building and did nothing while the sounds of automatic gunfire and explosions continued for hours
[2:02:40.840 --> 2:03:00.840]  In official transcripts there are over 100 witnesses who saw more than two shooters and more than 40 witnesses who identified the same two men in their 30s, one balding and the other with a short military style haircut. Several witnesses described the same adult male throwing a pipe bomb on the roof of the library
[2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:10.840]  All of them certain that it wasn't Dylan or Eric and all of this information pertaining to additional shooters has been redacted
[2:03:10.840 --> 2:03:26.840]  The FBI agent in charge of the Columbine investigation had a son who recently attended the school who shot a student film inside Columbine High two years before the shooting about a character wearing a trench coat shooting up the school
[2:03:26.840 --> 2:03:38.840]  Dylan and Eric fantasized about hijacking an airplane and crashing it into a New York City skyscraper in 1999. Are these just strange coincidences?
[2:03:38.840 --> 2:04:06.840]  Or remnants of the Feds MK Ultra program? An honest investigation into any of the mass school shootings following Columbine will have the same signatures such as families involved in the military industrial complex, prescribed SSRIs and other psychotropic drugs, psychological care provided by the state and associations with law enforcement prior to the shootings
[2:04:06.840 --> 2:04:22.840]  Just like we saw with the retired federal agent in regular communication with the Buffalo gunman in a private discord chat room, and in the recent Texas school shooting, how is the perpetrator able to afford nearly $5,000 of weaponry?
[2:04:22.840 --> 2:04:42.840]  And why did the police stand down while children were slaughtered? We are still allowed to question these things, but for how long? This evil will never stop until the truth is exposed, and unfortunately, most of us are too emotional to see things as they really are
[2:04:42.840 --> 2:04:56.840]  And for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees

[2:05:54.840 --> 2:06:19.840]  FreeWorldOutlet.com
[2:06:19.840 --> 2:06:29.840]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars
[2:06:29.840 --> 2:06:37.840]  We are not living in a boring world, we are living in the middle of adventure, that is for sure
[2:06:37.840 --> 2:06:44.840]  And incredible things are happening, trying to block the destiny of humanity into the future
[2:06:44.840 --> 2:06:47.840]  Let that sink in
[2:06:47.840 --> 2:06:51.840]  Let's race through phone calls this hour, call after call
[2:06:51.840 --> 2:06:55.840]  Greg in California, you're on the air, welcome
[2:06:55.840 --> 2:06:58.840]  Hey Alex, I hope you can hear me alright, I'd get back on the road
[2:06:58.840 --> 2:07:00.840]  I sure can brother, go ahead
[2:07:00.840 --> 2:07:05.840]  Okay, been listening to you for a long time
[2:07:05.840 --> 2:07:10.840]  I've been listening to you for a long time
[2:07:10.840 --> 2:07:15.840]  It's funny, you said, hey, can you hear me, I can hear you really great and all of a sudden it went like to hell
[2:07:15.840 --> 2:07:18.840]  So, try it again
[2:07:18.840 --> 2:07:20.840]  But right after the election
[2:07:20.840 --> 2:07:23.840]  I'm going to let you go, I appreciate your call, sorry Greg
[2:07:23.840 --> 2:07:26.840]  Let's go ahead and talk to Anonymous in California
[2:07:26.840 --> 2:07:29.840]  Anonymous, you're on the air, welcome
[2:07:29.840 --> 2:07:32.840]  Hey Alex, long time listener, first time caller
[2:07:32.840 --> 2:07:34.840]  Real quick, I'll try to be quick
[2:07:34.840 --> 2:07:37.840]  I work in the pest control industry
[2:07:37.840 --> 2:07:43.840]  It's another method that Bill Gates is using to get to us
[2:07:43.840 --> 2:07:46.840]  There's a product that's being used
[2:07:46.840 --> 2:07:52.840]  Now we know he's responsible for genetically modified mosquitoes and those being released
[2:07:52.840 --> 2:07:54.840]  Especially out here in California
[2:07:54.840 --> 2:07:58.840]  Well, there's a new product called in-to-care
[2:07:58.840 --> 2:08:00.840]  It's the in-to-care system
[2:08:00.840 --> 2:08:11.840]  It uses mosquitoes to spread the pesticide and infect bodies of water all around
[2:08:11.840 --> 2:08:15.840]  I don't know if it's something you guys have heard about
[2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:23.840]  I have specifically heard about that elaborate
[2:08:23.840 --> 2:08:33.840]  Well, it's just another way that his name, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:40.840]  Is an entity that funds this system
[2:08:40.840 --> 2:08:48.840]  I was surprised to even see their name on the screen when I was at this seminar
[2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:56.840]  But it just shows, once again, he's out to infect us and get us in every way he can
[2:08:56.840 --> 2:09:03.840]  We see it in the medical field, but I didn't think about it on the pest control side
[2:09:03.840 --> 2:09:07.840]  Well, he's obsessed with releasing GMO mosquitoes
[2:09:07.840 --> 2:09:09.840]  They're obsessed with GMO fish
[2:09:09.840 --> 2:09:14.840]  It's basically a genetic takeover of the entire planet
[2:09:14.840 --> 2:09:20.840]  Yeah, and it's being promoted as a safe, green, used item
[2:09:20.840 --> 2:09:26.840]  But the ingredient in it is high-rise fox defense
[2:09:26.840 --> 2:09:30.840]  Which is a juvenile hormone analog and an insect growth regulator
[2:09:30.840 --> 2:09:34.840]  And start that over again for listeners that just tuned in
[2:09:34.840 --> 2:09:38.840]  What were you at a seminar for? What did they say?
[2:09:38.840 --> 2:09:44.840]  It was for pest control, residential, commercial pest control
[2:09:44.840 --> 2:09:47.840]  It was just continuing education
[2:09:47.840 --> 2:09:54.840]  And what they were promoting, and the main product they were promoting is the intake care system
[2:09:54.840 --> 2:10:01.840]  And what it does is it uses mosquitoes to spread this chemical
[2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:07.840]  High-rise fox defense, which is a juvenile hormone analog and an insect growth regulator
[2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:12.840]  Because the mosquito is a natural vaccinator
[2:10:12.840 --> 2:10:19.840]  So they can program whatever they want and the mosquito then injects a large part of its liquid body
[2:10:19.840 --> 2:10:25.840]  Into you through the proboscis to then liquefy blood to suck it back up
[2:10:25.840 --> 2:10:28.840]  But instead it delivers the payload when that happens
[2:10:28.840 --> 2:10:31.840]  That's the mainline news, that's happening, you're absolutely right
[2:10:31.840 --> 2:10:32.840]  I'm glad you brought it up
[2:10:32.840 --> 2:10:37.840]  Well, it's not even the mosquito that's given it to you through its injection
[2:10:37.840 --> 2:10:43.840]  It's actually using its body, the chemical, attracted to its own body, kind of like static electricity
[2:10:43.840 --> 2:10:48.840]  And when it touches bodies of water, a swimming pool, a pond, a bucket of water
[2:10:48.840 --> 2:10:52.840]  It now infects that body of water with that chemical
[2:10:52.840 --> 2:10:53.840]  Send me info on that
[2:10:53.840 --> 2:10:59.840]  I mean, there's a total genetic engineering revolution taking place right now
[2:10:59.840 --> 2:11:02.840]  That's what this whole broadcast is about, God bless you, sir
[2:11:02.840 --> 2:11:05.840]  Send us information, yeah, the sky's the limit
[2:11:05.840 --> 2:11:10.840]  Let's talk to Queen in Tennessee, you're on the air, go ahead
[2:11:10.840 --> 2:11:13.840]  Hey, Alex, hey
[2:11:13.840 --> 2:11:22.840]  I've got a book that I recently obtained after surviving multiple trauma-based mind control rituals
[2:11:22.840 --> 2:11:30.840]  On Good Friday of this year, I got a book called International Business Machine Corporation Data Processing Division
[2:11:30.840 --> 2:11:33.840]  The Adventure of Tomorrow
[2:11:33.840 --> 2:11:37.840]  And this book tells their game plan
[2:11:37.840 --> 2:11:47.840]  And it basically also talks about, you know, using game theory and simulations
[2:11:47.840 --> 2:11:53.840]  This book's from 1979, and it basically talks about war gaming in the future
[2:11:53.840 --> 2:11:59.840]  It talks about using cheap and widely available war weapons, possibly new and simple methods
[2:11:59.840 --> 2:12:04.840]  For lethal biological chemical warfare, drops and storms can be used as weapons
[2:12:04.840 --> 2:12:12.840]  This is all on a timeline that they've created with the International Business Machines Corporation
[2:12:12.840 --> 2:12:14.840]  Back in 1979
[2:12:14.840 --> 2:12:17.840]  This book doesn't even have an ISP in
[2:12:17.840 --> 2:12:20.840]  Well, please mail us a copy of it
[2:12:20.840 --> 2:12:30.840]  You know, IBM is at the center of the spider's web of creating Bill Gates and Microsoft and Hitler before that, everything
[2:12:30.840 --> 2:12:39.840]  Yeah, I believe using the X2 that you have with the combination of the bodies and liquid nano-gold
[2:12:39.840 --> 2:12:45.840]  Helps to fortify our personal biosphere or creating a firewall against their chemical attacks
[2:12:45.840 --> 2:12:49.840]  Well, there's no doubt God gave us compounds to counter all this, but yeah
[2:12:49.840 --> 2:12:55.840]  If you look at IBM and everything it's done, it's at the very heart of the eugenics in the New World Order
[2:12:55.840 --> 2:12:57.840]  Thank you so much for the call
[2:12:57.840 --> 2:12:59.840]  Alright, moving quickly here to get to everybody
[2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:02.840]  Let's go ahead and order they are received
[2:13:02.840 --> 2:13:06.840]  Let's talk to Tristan in North Dakota, Tristan, welcome
[2:13:06.840 --> 2:13:08.840]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex
[2:13:08.840 --> 2:13:10.840]  Long time listener
[2:13:10.840 --> 2:13:16.840]  Been listening since the Obama administration first one had your blue t-shirt
[2:13:16.840 --> 2:13:18.840]  There's poison in the tap water
[2:13:18.840 --> 2:13:23.840]  Recently bought a TDS meter and just been testing around town the place that I lived
[2:13:23.840 --> 2:13:31.840]  And turns out that there's a total of like 6 to 700 parts per million of dissolvable solids in the water here
[2:13:31.840 --> 2:13:34.840]  So that's well above the EPA standard
[2:13:34.840 --> 2:13:39.840]  But a thing I was going to touch on was a subject that one of your previous callers had brought up
[2:13:39.840 --> 2:13:46.840]  Just the alkalis denation of the soil, like turning an alkali
[2:13:46.840 --> 2:13:57.840]  And then you've got big companies like Monsanto that have patented seeds that are resistant to the change in the pH levels in the soil
[2:13:57.840 --> 2:14:05.840]  So I also feel like it's a multi-angle attack not just on our genetics and everything
[2:14:05.840 --> 2:14:08.840]  Through poisoning us with the aluminum
[2:14:08.840 --> 2:14:10.840]  But there could also be...
[2:14:10.840 --> 2:14:13.840]  There was something that you talked about months ago
[2:14:13.840 --> 2:14:17.840]  Something along the lines of bioaccumulating nanoparticles
[2:14:17.840 --> 2:14:19.840]  Yes, the FDA said no review
[2:14:19.840 --> 2:14:22.840]  They're putting nanoparticles in a lot of the food now
[2:14:22.840 --> 2:14:30.840]  Yes, and you were saying that there was some that could be sprayed that actually fall through the less dense skin layer
[2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:35.840]  But are picked up by the higher density of your blood moving through your vessels
[2:14:35.840 --> 2:14:38.840]  And then it could actually be carried to the blood brain barrier
[2:14:38.840 --> 2:14:42.840]  Yeah, nanovirus penetrating particles, yeah
[2:14:42.840 --> 2:14:48.840]  Yeah, so watching just one of those shows on Band-Aid video talking about the Rwanda massacre
[2:14:48.840 --> 2:14:56.840]  And just different aspects of how different particles that may be being sprayed could be activated
[2:14:56.840 --> 2:15:01.840]  Via different frequencies in order to disrupt your cognitive abilities
[2:15:01.840 --> 2:15:06.840]  I mean, this is a globalist covert war that we're now in the middle of
[2:15:06.840 --> 2:15:09.840]  You're absolutely right, it's been launched, it's happening at every level
[2:15:09.840 --> 2:15:12.840]  We're here, we are inside of it now
[2:15:12.840 --> 2:15:14.840]  That's why it's so surreal, brother
[2:15:14.840 --> 2:15:16.840]  Isn't it crazy to be alive during this?
[2:15:16.840 --> 2:15:21.840]  Yeah, it is, and you coined the term clown world and it rings more true every day
[2:15:21.840 --> 2:15:25.840]  I forget my clown shoes and my clown nose, but we're really living it, aren't we?
[2:15:25.840 --> 2:15:27.840]  We are, brother, God bless you, Tristan
[2:15:27.840 --> 2:15:31.840]  Alright, Angelo, Richard, Patricia, Ken, John, Glenn
[2:15:31.840 --> 2:15:37.840]  Your calls and more, 877-789-2539
[2:15:37.840 --> 2:15:40.840]  877-789-2539

[2:17:51.840 --> 2:17:55.840]  InfoWars has been completely and totally vindicated
[2:17:55.840 --> 2:18:00.840]  And so have all of our AM and FM stations and our local TV stations across the country
[2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:05.840]  So I want to salute all of those amazing stations and those incredible listeners that have supported us
[2:18:05.840 --> 2:18:09.840]  And kept us on the air over the years as we've been demonized and lied about
[2:18:09.840 --> 2:18:12.840]  By the globalists owned and controlled press
[2:18:12.840 --> 2:18:18.840]  It's just come out as you know, the NIH confirmed that they were ordered by Fauci and others in years past
[2:18:18.840 --> 2:18:24.840]  To send hundreds of millions of dollars to the Wuhan lab to create super weaponized viruses
[2:18:24.840 --> 2:18:30.840]  Not just gain and function, super weaponized viruses as you know that broke two days ago now
[2:18:30.840 --> 2:18:36.840]  And they've only given Fauci and Peter Dazik five days to hand over all the rest of the documents
[2:18:36.840 --> 2:18:41.840]  So this is the rats leaving the sinking ship, this is evil being exposed
[2:18:41.840 --> 2:18:44.840]  And it's just the beginning, this is seismic, it's massive
[2:18:44.840 --> 2:18:48.840]  So keep spreading the word about InfoWars.com and support these local stations
[2:18:48.840 --> 2:18:51.840]  They are so incredibly important in their saving America
[2:18:51.840 --> 2:18:57.840]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right
[2:18:57.840 --> 2:18:59.840]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[2:18:59.840 --> 2:19:04.840]  Well, it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew this was coming, I tried to stop it
[2:19:04.840 --> 2:19:09.840]  And now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever
[2:19:09.840 --> 2:19:14.840]  Because the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents
[2:19:14.840 --> 2:19:16.840]  It's now out of the open.
[2:19:16.840 --> 2:19:23.840]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group
[2:19:23.840 --> 2:19:29.840]  So now the fight's out in the open, they're making their move because they know they're behind schedule
[2:19:29.840 --> 2:19:32.840]  We're going to win this thing. God's watching, the children are counting on us
[2:19:32.840 --> 2:19:37.840]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support
[2:19:37.840 --> 2:19:39.840]  Because without you, InfoWars would not be here
[2:19:39.840 --> 2:19:43.840]  So I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the InfoWars
[2:19:43.840 --> 2:19:46.840]  And you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance
[2:19:46.840 --> 2:19:49.840]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done
[2:19:49.840 --> 2:20:14.840]  And ask you now to redouble your efforts
[2:20:14.840 --> 2:20:19.840]  It really is an incredible time to be alive. To be living on this planet
[2:20:19.840 --> 2:20:22.840]  All the globalists have put in their technocracy
[2:20:22.840 --> 2:20:27.840]  And as soon as they had the AI in place, they launched their civilization collapsing event
[2:20:27.840 --> 2:20:31.840]  They're at war with us, and it's happening
[2:20:31.840 --> 2:20:35.840]  Alright, let's go to the callers in the order they were received
[2:20:35.840 --> 2:20:40.840]  Let's talk to Angelo in California. Angelo, welcome
[2:20:40.840 --> 2:20:49.840]  Thank you. These morons are springing on themselves as well
[2:20:49.840 --> 2:20:58.840]  It's so crazy. I mean, these ignominious POSs, it's unreal
[2:20:58.840 --> 2:21:02.840]  Well, that's because they're taking orders from the spirit that controls them to kill us
[2:21:02.840 --> 2:21:04.840]  And they believe they have processes to heal themselves
[2:21:04.840 --> 2:21:09.840]  But they believe they're part of a transformation, a mutation
[2:21:09.840 --> 2:21:12.840]  Yes, they definitely have the tech
[2:21:12.840 --> 2:21:18.840]  I mean, when David Adair, David Adair was the guy who tried to back up our power grid
[2:21:18.840 --> 2:21:20.840]  And got rejected three times
[2:21:20.840 --> 2:21:28.840]  When he was 17, they took him down to Groom Lake, which was area 51, and it was 1971
[2:21:28.840 --> 2:21:35.840]  And he went in and there was this big iris, and the guy went over and he put his hands on a pad
[2:21:35.840 --> 2:21:39.840]  And he put his eyes in the skin, and there was a flash
[2:21:39.840 --> 2:21:44.840]  So they had a retina scanner and a palm scanner in 1971
[2:21:44.840 --> 2:21:48.840]  And we didn't even have calculators at that time
[2:21:48.840 --> 2:21:49.840]  Exactly
[2:21:49.840 --> 2:21:54.840]  Yeah, now they were probably 23 years ahead then
[2:21:54.840 --> 2:21:58.840]  They're probably about a thousand years ahead now
[2:21:58.840 --> 2:22:03.840]  I mean, they've got, it's like there's two different worlds
[2:22:03.840 --> 2:22:07.840]  We've got this world on the surface, which they're destroying
[2:22:07.840 --> 2:22:11.840]  And then they've got the underground bases, 350 of them at least
[2:22:11.840 --> 2:22:17.840]  That's right, the Brecolye Scientific Dictatorship is absorbing the old world and building its new one
[2:22:17.840 --> 2:22:20.840]  That's what the Davos group says
[2:22:20.840 --> 2:22:25.840]  Yep, yep, two different worlds, and we're not part of it
[2:22:25.840 --> 2:22:27.840]  There's no room for us
[2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:32.840]  And it's crazy, I mean, it's said
[2:22:32.840 --> 2:22:41.840]  While I track what these guys are doing, I'd really like to see some of this stuff firsthand
[2:22:41.840 --> 2:22:46.840]  Well, it's a Brecolye civilization, and it's the ultimate form of greed
[2:22:46.840 --> 2:22:52.840]  The ultimate form of class, that they are the scientific elite that stole our ideas
[2:22:52.840 --> 2:22:55.840]  And now they've separated us, it's incredible
[2:22:55.840 --> 2:22:57.840]  Thank you so much for the call, Angelo, amazing caller
[2:22:57.840 --> 2:22:59.840]  All these calls have been amazing today
[2:22:59.840 --> 2:23:02.840]  Let's talk to another caller, who's been home the longest now
[2:23:02.840 --> 2:23:06.840]  That would be...
[2:23:06.840 --> 2:23:09.840]  Ken in Illinois, you're on the air, Ken
[2:23:09.840 --> 2:23:11.840]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call
[2:23:11.840 --> 2:23:14.840]  I appreciate everything that you've been doing, and you're an amazing crew
[2:23:14.840 --> 2:23:20.840]  I especially love when they put together, you singing opera, I think you should use that more
[2:23:20.840 --> 2:23:22.840]  That voice more often
[2:23:22.840 --> 2:23:26.840]  We'll come into the next segment with somebody with the meme of me singing opera
[2:23:26.840 --> 2:23:27.840]  Okay, we'll do that
[2:23:27.840 --> 2:23:29.840]  Also, we're going to play the Klaus Schwab promos
[2:23:29.840 --> 2:23:32.840]  Where I hijacked the World Economic Forum, it's satire
[2:23:32.840 --> 2:23:36.840]  And the Klaus Schwab takes my show, we'll play those coming up
[2:23:36.840 --> 2:23:39.840]  Yeah, is it Carl Klaus?
[2:23:39.840 --> 2:23:40.840]  It's Klaus
[2:23:40.840 --> 2:23:42.840]  Klaus Schwab
[2:23:42.840 --> 2:23:45.840]  Okay, so I've got a question and then a request
[2:23:45.840 --> 2:23:50.840]  The first question is, where is our Air Force, our international guard, with these two eye-overs?
[2:23:50.840 --> 2:23:52.840]  I mean, we're being attacked
[2:23:52.840 --> 2:23:57.840]  I almost believe that for everyone to really have their eyes open to know that this is for real
[2:23:57.840 --> 2:24:02.840]  Is to break down one of these things, you know, hey, what is this playing?
[2:24:02.840 --> 2:24:06.840]  What's it got on board?
[2:24:06.840 --> 2:24:13.840]  I mean, they're able to scramble checks for us being invaded, we're being invaded, so where are they at?
[2:24:13.840 --> 2:24:17.840]  Well, you know, Ken, you go back to the same place every other human does, and I'm a human too
[2:24:17.840 --> 2:24:20.840]  Where you want to individually challenge it
[2:24:20.840 --> 2:24:27.840]  I showed you the documents, the treaties, the admissions that they're doing it through a global operation
[2:24:27.840 --> 2:24:29.840]  So where's Congress?
[2:24:29.840 --> 2:24:34.840]  Instead of debating whether it exists, they admit they're doing it, it's toxic, they're spraying pesticides on us
[2:24:34.840 --> 2:24:38.840]  I showed the documents earlier, what do we do about that?
[2:24:38.840 --> 2:24:45.840]  Right, but it shouldn't take an act of Congress for our own Air Force, international guard, to be protecting us
[2:24:45.840 --> 2:24:53.840]  And at our job, if there's a plane up there that is not identified, they should be trying to identify it
[2:24:53.840 --> 2:24:56.840]  You understand, they're putting it in the jet fuel
[2:24:56.840 --> 2:25:00.840]  A lot of folks calling, I've been on there for 28 years
[2:25:00.840 --> 2:25:04.840]  And for 25, we've been talking about Chemtrolls and every caller, and I love you to death, is the same like
[2:25:04.840 --> 2:25:07.840]  We need somebody to identify, we need somebody to know
[2:25:07.840 --> 2:25:12.840]  I just showed you EU documents where they admit what they're spraying and what they're doing, it's an admitted program
[2:25:12.840 --> 2:25:20.840]  But we never would address it as that, we just address it as, oh, we've got to figure out what they're doing, does that make sense?
[2:25:20.840 --> 2:25:31.840]  Yeah, I would just love to have action on it, and yeah, I understand what you're saying
[2:25:31.840 --> 2:25:37.840]  But then I also want to get to my request, whenever you guys are bringing up about the food prep plants, catch the fire
[2:25:37.840 --> 2:25:46.840]  If you could also mention for us as listeners, to reach out to our local food prep plants, such as just even, you know, if you're a hunter
[2:25:46.840 --> 2:25:54.840]  And you're taking your deer somewhere to get processed, talk to them, let them know that they need to have some security going on
[2:25:54.840 --> 2:26:05.840]  So that they don't go up in flames, because we don't know how far they're going to go, how are they going to go to that level of trying to go to where we're processing our deer meat
[2:26:05.840 --> 2:26:10.840]  So there's a total attack on all agriculture, all human activity, thank you so much for the call
[2:26:10.840 --> 2:26:15.840]  Let's go ahead and take another call, let's talk to Richard in Tennessee, go ahead Richard
[2:26:15.840 --> 2:26:23.840]  Good afternoon Alex, yeah, this is Richard in Tennessee, and first I'd like to make a product plug, I did the liver cleanse years ago
[2:26:23.840 --> 2:26:33.840]  I was experiencing diabetic symptoms, neuropathy and sugar sweat, and both went away after I did the liver cleanse, they came back, I did another liver cleanse, and they went away again
[2:26:33.840 --> 2:26:48.840]  So I just thought that would help somebody, but it's in the congressional budget, stratospheric aerosols are listed on the same website that you had out at LE targets years ago
[2:26:48.840 --> 2:26:59.840]  Stratospheric aerosols are being purchased on USAspending.gov or showing the purchasing and all the different, I guess, attached work orders or whatever they're under
[2:26:59.840 --> 2:27:08.840]  But it goes back at least 10 years, and I just thought I'd give you a heads up, I think that would go viral, that type of information as well
[2:27:08.840 --> 2:27:16.840]  No, you're totally right, and I'm glad you're down this, the Sally, because it's admitted treaties, it's admitted operations, it's admitted programs
[2:27:16.840 --> 2:27:28.840]  And I get the publics like, hey, trails didn't used to stay in the air, what's going on? But we have the documents, we should have a, how do we push to make Congress or governors or others say, hey, here's these documents, what are they spraying us with?
[2:27:28.840 --> 2:27:32.840]  The whole house of cards will fold at that point
[2:27:32.840 --> 2:27:48.840]  Right, absolutely, and the thing is, stratospheric aerosols, there's only one stratosphere and there are in fact aerosols up there now, so I've noticed that they'll, like it'll rain like two to three days after they spray
[2:27:48.840 --> 2:28:03.840]  So I always think, you know, what comes first, the rain or the chemtrails, but I just really appreciate you, I actually put together a radio show here in town, you were on it for one episode with Elaine Davis, I don't know if you remember that or not
[2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:17.840]  But we were on for almost three years, and I think we had a very big impact, actually made some waves in the area, so you changed my life, both health and political views, and I really appreciate you
[2:28:17.840 --> 2:28:25.840]  Richard, I appreciate you, and I've done thousands of interviews, but I really, I remember being on in Tennessee many times, so thank you so much, Richard
[2:28:25.840 --> 2:28:40.840]  We're going to go to break, it's your chance to get on air, we love talking to you, the system hates people having free speech, we're about to do it straight ahead, more phone calls from Matt, TJ, James, Glenn, James, Patricia, John, your calls all straight ahead
[2:28:40.840 --> 2:28:47.840]  And we'll take that first hour today that was so powerful, we'll archive that at band.video, please help share that, we'll be right back
[2:29:40.840 --> 2:30:01.840]  With the World Awakening, I think it was important that we were right there, to prevent them right now, take advantage of this moment, and I've always had an idea that something everybody can do, that every listener can do, I think it could be powerful and effective
[2:30:01.840 --> 2:30:12.840]  For us to, you know, hang banners over highways, imagine it's right there, it says Alex Jones is right, info, stop, car, we stand with the truckers, rest out, or whatever
[2:30:12.840 --> 2:30:25.840]  Brother, I'm so glad you called, elaborate on this, yes, now is the time in your small town, or your big city, to write something on the bathroom wall, or to put a sticker on your car, or banner hangs over highways, and it will be a chain reaction
[2:30:25.840 --> 2:30:27.840]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[2:30:27.840 --> 2:30:37.840]  I have a few ideas, first of all, Alex Jones is right, info, stop, farm, rest out, rest out, swap, the vaccine is poison, there's tons of things, I say keep it short, keep it concise
[2:30:37.840 --> 2:30:42.840]  I agree, arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates, the COVID-vaxx is poison, beautiful
[2:30:42.840 --> 2:30:46.840]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved, and we could all be effective, so that's what I'm calling about
[2:30:46.840 --> 2:30:51.840]  God bless you Chris, in Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today, thank you so much

[2:35:05.840 --> 2:35:18.840]  All right, they hate us being on air, they hate us on hundreds of stations, they hate us reaching millions online, they hate the fact that we're not backing down and rolling over and dying, and the fact that we've got God on our side.
[2:35:18.840 --> 2:35:26.840]  So now we're taking your phone calls, in the order that these great phone calls have been received.
[2:35:26.840 --> 2:35:32.840]  So let's go ahead and talk to Patricia in the great state of Texas, Patricia you're on the air.
[2:35:32.840 --> 2:35:45.840]  Hi Alex, I was just going to let you know, talking about the chemtrail, there are two products that are wonderful, that will help and I recommend bodies, the turmeric and lung cleanser.
[2:35:45.840 --> 2:36:02.840]  Because I know turmeric helps with your sinuses, but I also was going to let you know that I noticed that during COVID, when they would spray very heavily in our skies, that the very next day or several days the COVID numbers would go sky hot.
[2:36:02.840 --> 2:36:06.840]  So I don't know if there was any connection to that.
[2:36:06.840 --> 2:36:22.840]  Depending on document, London telegraphs that they are spraying nanotech COVID in the air, and I gave you the EU and the UN and the official Spanish government saying they're spraying pesticides on you in the chemtrails.
[2:36:22.840 --> 2:36:41.840]  Yes, I believe that because like I said, the COVID numbers would skyrocket when that would happen. And then also I want to do a shout out to Mike Morales on YouTube. He talks about this and he shows that they're also doing it in our ocean and they use bunker fuel.
[2:36:41.840 --> 2:36:57.840]  And when you go to Wikipedia, it tells you that under the health impact, prior to 2020, that it would cause 400,000 premature deaths and 14 million childhood asthma cases each year.
[2:36:57.840 --> 2:37:11.840]  But after 2020, they introduced cleaner fuel, but still have around 250,000 deaths and 6.4 million childhood asthma cases each year.
[2:37:11.840 --> 2:37:14.840]  Well, the adults are playing God. There's no doubt about that.
[2:37:14.840 --> 2:37:35.840]  Yes, I agree with you 100%. And I just want to thank you for all your products that I wanted to play those two because they really do help. And I pray through our Father God that he will bless you in your righteous endeavors through Jesus Christ and that you will be overwhelmed.
[2:37:35.840 --> 2:37:40.840]  Your cup will overflow with the money you need to fight these people.
[2:37:40.840 --> 2:37:47.840]  Well, Patricia, thank you so much. We're definitely in a fight with the globalists. So there's nowhere better to support than here, point blank.
[2:37:47.840 --> 2:37:50.840]  I wish that wasn't even the case. It's pretty scary that we're the best there is.
[2:37:50.840 --> 2:37:54.840]  All right, let's talk to Glenn in Missouri. Glenn, go ahead.
[2:37:54.840 --> 2:37:56.840]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[2:37:56.840 --> 2:37:57.840]  Good, brother.
[2:37:57.840 --> 2:38:04.840]  Hey, listen, just first of all, you know, I don't take it personal. I hate the new format, but that's just me. I hate change.
[2:38:04.840 --> 2:38:05.840]  So don't take it.
[2:38:05.840 --> 2:38:07.840]  What is the new format? What is the new format?
[2:38:07.840 --> 2:38:17.840]  Well, just, you know, the new, you know, just how you're, the show that I'm, you know, watching you on the Internet there.
[2:38:17.840 --> 2:38:21.840]  But I love it. I'm a, I'm a, I just like.
[2:38:21.840 --> 2:38:30.840]  Well, let me stop you because I'm dumb. I'm dumb. I'm dumb. Glenn, this is the same show has been in the syndicated format 25 years in this time slot.
[2:38:30.840 --> 2:38:38.840]  And I've not changed anything. I discovered the news to take calls and have guests on. Well, you hate the new format, but you love it. Well, what is the new format?
[2:38:38.840 --> 2:38:47.840]  Well, just, you know, just, you know, the, I don't know the little changes. I just, you know, but anyway, I'm a big supporter. I got the coins.
[2:38:47.840 --> 2:38:57.840]  I missed the first one, but I got the last two. God bless you. You know, we're still this country is still a law abiding, you know, Constitution.
[2:38:57.840 --> 2:39:07.840]  You know, we've, we are the country of laws. We got the US Constitution under our belt and we got to stick with that.
[2:39:07.840 --> 2:39:15.840]  You know, we got to find these people and put them in jail. That's all. It's, you know, it's okay to lock up the bad guy, isn't it?
[2:39:15.840 --> 2:39:24.840]  Hey, I'm not arguing with you, brother. I appreciate your call. It's just, if you can give me specifics on a format change, I will tell you.
[2:39:24.840 --> 2:39:39.840]  I mean, I can't sit here and lie to people about where we are. And now it's all out the oven. And I mean, it's surreal for me, as I've said, to sit here and watch this all unfold.
[2:39:39.840 --> 2:39:46.840]  I don't know what to say. I just, I don't know what to say to you, brother. I don't know what to say. Thank you, Glenn.
[2:39:46.840 --> 2:39:52.840]  Let's go ahead and talk to another caller. Let's talk to John in Florida. John, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:39:52.840 --> 2:39:55.840]  What's up, Alex Jones? Go ahead, sir.
[2:39:55.840 --> 2:40:06.840]  I want to talk about the chemtrails real quick. These things have been going on for a long time and they've been barring us with whatever they want, whatever they want to put in those things.
[2:40:06.840 --> 2:40:11.840]  They could do it with aluminum and borium one day. They could do it with Corona, the next they could do it with whatever they want.
[2:40:11.840 --> 2:40:21.840]  I think they use, when they have waste byproduct and they can't get rid of them, where do they dump them? Right on top of us.
[2:40:21.840 --> 2:40:26.840]  In the old days, people just dump stuff in the river. Now they dump it, they admit that, actually.
[2:40:26.840 --> 2:40:34.840]  In State Department of Morandom 200 by Henry Kissinger, State Department of Morandom 200, he says just dump the toxic waste right in their food.
[2:40:34.840 --> 2:40:42.840]  Exactly. And it's not a conspiracy theory when they admit to it. It's a conspiracy fact.
[2:40:42.840 --> 2:40:49.840]  Well, that's my great frustration, is that this stuff is just right out in the open. Right out in the open.
[2:40:49.840 --> 2:40:51.840]  What do we do about it, John?
[2:40:51.840 --> 2:41:01.840]  I think what I've been doing is a couple of years back, actually, over a decade back, I got an argument with the officer out of the Air Force up there by Kate Canaveral.
[2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:11.840]  And he told me about the chemtrails, prove it. And I told him, it's not hard to prove something that you can see with your own eyes.
[2:41:11.840 --> 2:41:21.840]  And I've literally witnessed two different planes fly by perpendicular, one with a line and one without, one at 80,000 and one at 35,000.
[2:41:21.840 --> 2:41:29.840]  One has people on it, one does not. This is simple.
[2:41:29.840 --> 2:41:42.840]  I agree with what you're saying, but you understand we showed the first-hour mainstream news, CBS, ABC News, Council on Foreign Relations, UN documents, Spanish government documents, EU documents, admitting it.
[2:41:42.840 --> 2:41:48.840]  So I've done hundreds of shows on this and literally almost no one cares about the documents.
[2:41:48.840 --> 2:41:54.840]  Like, we keep having a debate about, look, it's happening. They admit they're doing it. It's like world government.
[2:41:54.840 --> 2:42:00.840]  And Paul Schwab says, we rule the earth. We're going to have a world ID. We control everything you do. We're going to take everything away from you.
[2:42:00.840 --> 2:42:05.840]  It's like, is there really a world government? We still have a debate about it.
[2:42:05.840 --> 2:42:19.840]  All I know is if you're in the military or you're in the, you know, above the military, some kind of intelligence, and you're going along with this stuff, when it finally boils over, you better watch out.
[2:42:19.840 --> 2:42:25.840]  I agree. People pretending they're part of the power structure and are exempt from this are completely and totally insane.
[2:42:25.840 --> 2:42:27.840]  Thank you, John. Smartest things said today.
[2:42:27.840 --> 2:42:36.840]  All right. Coming up next segment, James, Matt, Greg, Emmanuel, and others ahead of the guest host in the fourth hour.

[2:46:48.840 --> 2:46:54.840]  Thanks for being part of the tip of the spear.
[2:46:54.840 --> 2:47:02.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:02.840 --> 2:47:12.840]  Oh
[2:47:32.840 --> 2:47:47.840]  It's a great pleasure.
[2:47:47.840 --> 2:47:55.840]  We do not yet know the full extent and systemic and structural changes which will happen.
[2:47:55.840 --> 2:48:05.840]  However, we do know that global energy systems, food systems and supply chains will be deeply affected.
[2:48:05.840 --> 2:48:14.840]  In times of crisis, the role of governments is more important and more relevant than ever.
[2:48:14.840 --> 2:48:26.840]  What is also needed is a summit like this one to go beyond crisis management and to look into constructive ways we can build our common future.
[2:48:26.840 --> 2:48:38.840]  In conclusion, and despite all the challenges we have to uphold our responsibility which we have towards the next generation
[2:48:38.840 --> 2:48:49.840]  and which we can only fulfill through collaboration on a national and on a global level.
[2:48:49.840 --> 2:48:53.840]  All right, taking final phone calls ahead of the next guest host.
[2:48:53.840 --> 2:48:56.840]  It's set to take over here today.
[2:48:56.840 --> 2:49:01.840]  Paul Joseph Watson. Wow.
[2:49:01.840 --> 2:49:09.840]  Look, I want to say this, I was sitting there during the break thinking, man, you're covering really depressing things, really scary things, but God's in control.
[2:49:09.840 --> 2:49:10.840]  And we have to give it to God.
[2:49:10.840 --> 2:49:11.840]  We have to believe in God.
[2:49:11.840 --> 2:49:14.840]  We have to understand that through God, we can transcend this.
[2:49:14.840 --> 2:49:17.840]  This is a process that the globalists are not God.
[2:49:17.840 --> 2:49:19.840]  They can pretend to be God.
[2:49:19.840 --> 2:49:21.840]  They can play God all day.
[2:49:21.840 --> 2:49:24.840]  They can break the social contract, but they will fail in the end.
[2:49:24.840 --> 2:49:27.840]  So the order to receive was take calls.
[2:49:27.840 --> 2:49:29.840]  Let's talk to James and then Matt.
[2:49:29.840 --> 2:49:35.840]  James and Arizona are on the air.
[2:49:35.840 --> 2:49:38.840]  James, you busy?
[2:49:38.840 --> 2:49:40.840]  Hey, I love the Sergio Leone music.
[2:49:40.840 --> 2:49:41.840]  That was good.
[2:49:41.840 --> 2:49:43.840]  Go ahead.
[2:49:43.840 --> 2:49:44.840]  Hey, I had a question.
[2:49:44.840 --> 2:49:53.840]  I'm a young guy born in 1995, so it's been one kind of a mindfuck to discern what's going on in this reality.
[2:49:53.840 --> 2:49:54.840]  But you've been great help.
[2:49:54.840 --> 2:49:57.840]  I had a question to, you know, I'm not a scientist.
[2:49:57.840 --> 2:49:58.840]  I can't research everything.
[2:49:58.840 --> 2:50:00.840]  But I can't do it a bit.
[2:50:00.840 --> 2:50:04.840]  I came across a guy, Dr. Hardy, lying back.
[2:50:04.840 --> 2:50:09.840]  He's a long-term dentist, you know, doing it his whole life in Canada.
[2:50:09.840 --> 2:50:15.840]  He was like on the board of National Academies of Sciences as over 100 publications in dentistry.
[2:50:15.840 --> 2:50:22.840]  They have reports and there's lots of literature on it about water fluoridation.
[2:50:22.840 --> 2:50:28.840]  How it's, you know, basically not really helping to decay that much.
[2:50:28.840 --> 2:50:37.840]  And that it causes several risks to brain development, fetus development, IQ, bone development.
[2:50:37.840 --> 2:50:44.840]  It's where I can build up in the system, even though, you know, FDA has regulations where they permit, you know.
[2:50:44.840 --> 2:50:50.840]  Yeah, they started out in the 40s with the fluoride and water, not calcium fluoride, but hydrofluorosilic acid.
[2:50:50.840 --> 2:50:55.840]  And it eats your brain, annihilates fertility, massively causes cancer.
[2:50:55.840 --> 2:50:56.840]  Absolutely.
[2:50:56.840 --> 2:50:58.840]  It's a well-known document in fact.
[2:50:58.840 --> 2:51:00.840]  Yeah, so that's going on.
[2:51:00.840 --> 2:51:05.840]  I'm sure there's other things in the water that probably is an entire dose has been.
[2:51:05.840 --> 2:51:08.840]  It all needs to be, if at all.
[2:51:08.840 --> 2:51:19.840]  So yeah, I kind of was thinking like how did we get to this situation where America has been dumbed down so much that we're allowing sort of all these things to happen,
[2:51:19.840 --> 2:51:23.840]  allowing the oligarchs to call out a shot, people going along with it.
[2:51:23.840 --> 2:51:25.840]  Is this part of it?
[2:51:25.840 --> 2:51:27.840]  And how do we, how do we get our way out?
[2:51:27.840 --> 2:51:28.840]  Like, can we do it?
[2:51:28.840 --> 2:51:29.840]  Well, that's it, brother.
[2:51:29.840 --> 2:51:32.840]  I think you're, the whole question of the last three hours is we have to awaken.
[2:51:32.840 --> 2:51:33.840]  We have to admit the facts.
[2:51:33.840 --> 2:51:36.840]  We have to become awake and say no to it.
[2:51:36.840 --> 2:51:40.840]  So I think you have to know on the head.
[2:51:40.840 --> 2:51:43.840]  Well, well, well, thanks for, for doing what you do.
[2:51:43.840 --> 2:51:44.840]  Thanks for having me on.
[2:51:44.840 --> 2:51:46.840]  Brother, we're in the same boat together.
[2:51:46.840 --> 2:51:47.840]  God bless you, James.
[2:51:47.840 --> 2:51:49.840]  All right, let's talk to color in Wisconsin.
[2:51:49.840 --> 2:51:51.840]  Let's talk to Matt in Wisconsin.
[2:51:51.840 --> 2:51:53.840]  Matt, go ahead.
[2:51:53.840 --> 2:51:54.840]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[2:51:54.840 --> 2:51:56.840]  You're my favorite ice cream flavor.
[2:51:56.840 --> 2:52:06.840]  And I wanted to, you know, bring up how the globalists believe that we live in some sort of Wakanda society while forgetting the Waukesha aspects of it.
[2:52:06.840 --> 2:52:13.840]  And a lot of people forget with the chemtrails that the ground based systems pump out more clouds.
[2:52:13.840 --> 2:52:28.840]  If you type in Jeremy Clarkson from Top Gear, NASA cloud on YouTube, you can see these so called rocket testing facilities that NASA has a hundred square miles around it is all for NASA.
[2:52:28.840 --> 2:52:31.840]  And they fill the atmosphere with clouds.
[2:52:31.840 --> 2:52:37.840]  And obviously it goes without saying it's a lot easier to provide the poisonous chemicals on the ground than doing it in the air.
[2:52:37.840 --> 2:52:42.840]  And another huge point, which is huge, Joe Rogan brought it up on Joe Rogan show.
[2:52:42.840 --> 2:52:55.840]  Is that the metal particulate is also like a trident multi-pronged attack where they can use it as an EMP to take down UFOs and enemy aircraft because the atmosphere itself becomes charged.
[2:52:55.840 --> 2:53:04.840]  And lastly, with the water supply, I think with Europe and how America is being turned into Europe.
[2:53:04.840 --> 2:53:16.840]  I think comes from how Europe uses more bidets where they're boofing or getting anally the fluoride and chemicals because they have water going up there took it.
[2:53:16.840 --> 2:53:18.840]  All right, good, good job there.
[2:53:18.840 --> 2:53:20.840]  All right, let's take another call here.
[2:53:20.840 --> 2:53:22.840]  Let's talk to Greg in Pennsylvania.
[2:53:22.840 --> 2:53:23.840]  Greg, you're on the air.
[2:53:23.840 --> 2:53:25.840]  Go ahead.
[2:53:25.840 --> 2:53:26.840]  Hi, Alex.
[2:53:26.840 --> 2:53:28.840]  Thanks for taking my call.
[2:53:28.840 --> 2:53:36.840]  If I could real quick, I wanted to plug X2 and bodies. I'm 61 going to be 62 this year.
[2:53:36.840 --> 2:53:41.840]  I was feeling pretty old, 53, 54 years old, getting up slow.
[2:53:41.840 --> 2:53:46.840]  I had that brain fog going on and I started taking your supplements.
[2:53:46.840 --> 2:53:51.840]  And wow, I can't live without them now.
[2:53:51.840 --> 2:53:53.840]  Truly great products.
[2:53:53.840 --> 2:53:54.840]  Oh, whatever you want on that.
[2:53:54.840 --> 2:53:56.840]  I mean, what impoverished products did you take?
[2:53:56.840 --> 2:53:57.840]  What happened?
[2:53:57.840 --> 2:53:59.840]  Oh, I take the X2 every day.
[2:53:59.840 --> 2:54:02.840]  I have for probably six years.
[2:54:02.840 --> 2:54:06.840]  The bodies, I take every day.
[2:54:06.840 --> 2:54:08.840]  I missed the real red pill.
[2:54:08.840 --> 2:54:11.840]  I took that every day.
[2:54:11.840 --> 2:54:14.840]  I use your alpha power.
[2:54:14.840 --> 2:54:21.840]  I just thought your vitamin C product and I take the B12.
[2:54:21.840 --> 2:54:28.840]  The ultra 12 and the vitamin D.
[2:54:28.840 --> 2:54:34.840]  I take them all in the morning and in the evening and I sleep great.
[2:54:34.840 --> 2:54:36.840]  My pain is gone.
[2:54:36.840 --> 2:54:38.840]  My back doesn't hurt anymore.
[2:54:38.840 --> 2:54:44.840]  I don't get up after like stretch and I just don't have that anymore.
[2:54:44.840 --> 2:54:46.840]  I spring out of bed.
[2:54:46.840 --> 2:54:51.840]  It just took away so much of that pain and brain fog.
[2:54:51.840 --> 2:54:55.840]  The X2 I think is really, really the super, super product.
[2:54:55.840 --> 2:54:56.840]  Well, exactly.
[2:54:56.840 --> 2:55:04.840]  The UN estimates two plus million, two plus billion, excuse me, people have cognitive disabilities or lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[2:55:04.840 --> 2:55:06.840]  They took iodine out of salt.
[2:55:06.840 --> 2:55:10.840]  They put the poison fluoride and chloride in the water.
[2:55:10.840 --> 2:55:11.840]  That's the opposite.
[2:55:11.840 --> 2:55:12.840]  And that's why this is pure iodine.
[2:55:12.840 --> 2:55:13.840]  Nobody else has.
[2:55:13.840 --> 2:55:15.840]  That's why X2 is so incredibly important.
[2:55:15.840 --> 2:55:20.840]  Everybody, the experience X2 for themselves takes about two weeks to kick in.
[2:55:20.840 --> 2:55:22.840]  X2infowarstore.com.
[2:55:22.840 --> 2:55:24.840]  What else is on your mind?
[2:55:24.840 --> 2:55:26.840]  Well, I give the X2 to my wife.
[2:55:26.840 --> 2:55:29.840]  I gave her a bottle of my beautiful wife Valerie.
[2:55:29.840 --> 2:55:30.840]  She loves you.
[2:55:30.840 --> 2:55:32.840]  She's listed to you for years.
[2:55:32.840 --> 2:55:40.840]  And she talked about a lot of this stuff you talk about with the chem trails and, you know, this being an alien type.
[2:55:40.840 --> 2:55:42.840]  There's no other way to explain it.
[2:55:42.840 --> 2:55:50.840]  But, you know, a lot of our friends and stuff just think she's total nuts, but a lot of them now are seeing it.
[2:55:50.840 --> 2:55:54.840]  My wife is an incredible girl.
[2:55:54.840 --> 2:55:58.840]  She just has a different perspective on things.
[2:55:58.840 --> 2:56:04.840]  And it's a perspective, I think, that comes from deep intelligence.
[2:56:04.840 --> 2:56:05.840]  I really do.
[2:56:05.840 --> 2:56:08.840]  She's a great person and a great woman.
[2:56:08.840 --> 2:56:23.840]  The thing that I caught about the Alex was these leaders, so-called leaders that we see, Bill Gates, Blau Schwab, Blau, George Soros.
[2:56:23.840 --> 2:56:35.840]  I believe, and I've been listening and paying attention to this for all of my adult life, I believe that these are like the regional managers of a corporate structure.
[2:56:35.840 --> 2:56:47.840]  And as ugly and as demonic as these people are, they work for somebody that has quadrillions of dollars.
[2:56:47.840 --> 2:56:52.840]  And these are the people that put all this stuff together.
[2:56:52.840 --> 2:57:05.840]  And, you know, these are the agents of evil, but they work for a greater evil, and these demons are so ugly that you really couldn't even lay eyes on them.
[2:57:05.840 --> 2:57:11.840]  It's just incredible, this smorgasbord of crap that we're being fed.
[2:57:11.840 --> 2:57:22.840]  You know, the idea that a lie goes around the world before the truth puts its pants on, well, they've launched thousands of lies and we're trying to catch up with the truth.
[2:57:22.840 --> 2:57:23.840]  But God is on our side.
[2:57:23.840 --> 2:57:24.840]  Thank you so much, Craig.
[2:57:24.840 --> 2:57:25.840]  Amazing points.
[2:57:25.840 --> 2:57:26.840]  All right.
[2:57:26.840 --> 2:57:33.840]  Immanuel, Turk, two final calls, then Paul, Joseph Watson takes over.
[2:57:33.840 --> 2:57:34.840]  We're back in two minutes.
[2:57:34.840 --> 2:57:40.840]  We'll take five minutes of calls straight ahead in the war room in one hour.

[2:57:49.840 --> 2:57:57.840]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, down and out, is just the thing.
[2:57:57.840 --> 2:58:04.840]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[2:58:04.840 --> 2:58:15.840]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, knockout, with down and out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[2:58:15.840 --> 2:58:20.840]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[2:58:20.840 --> 2:58:30.840]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[2:58:30.840 --> 2:58:36.840]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.

[3:00:09.840 --> 3:00:35.840]  All right, this is a short little segment. We're going to jam two calls in and then Paul Joseph Watson of Summit.News takes over.
[3:00:35.840 --> 3:00:39.840]  This is Daniel in California. Welcome.
[3:00:39.840 --> 3:00:41.840]  You hear me all right? Yes, sir.
[3:00:41.840 --> 3:00:43.840]  Nice to talk to you.
[3:00:43.840 --> 3:00:50.840]  About the chemtrails, there was a Fox 40 News report a few years back. It was out of Las Vegas.
[3:00:50.840 --> 3:00:59.840]  So if you type in Fox 40 News, Las Vegas, Nevada, they have a report that for the first time they were using drones to be used for cloud seeding.
[3:00:59.840 --> 3:01:05.840]  So they admitted that they were spraying in the atmosphere and they've been using planes since the 1950s.
[3:01:05.840 --> 3:01:09.840]  But the only reason they did the report was because they're bragging now they're using drones for it.
[3:01:09.840 --> 3:01:13.840]  And then they were talking about the chemicals in there.
[3:01:13.840 --> 3:01:21.840]  And one of the things I remember where they're saying there is a yellow organic compound and the guy they were interviewing with that said it doesn't even know what it was.
[3:01:21.840 --> 3:01:25.840]  So they're spraying this stuff without even knowing what's in it.
[3:01:25.840 --> 3:01:29.840]  People say, oh, have the pilots exposed it. They're told to spray it.
[3:01:29.840 --> 3:01:33.840]  That's why they admit there's these projects. That's what we've got to expose.
[3:01:33.840 --> 3:01:37.840]  Well, the government, it was the government admitting it.
[3:01:37.840 --> 3:01:42.840]  But the trick is when you say chemtrails, it's a conspiracy. You got to use cloud seeding.
[3:01:42.840 --> 3:01:45.840]  That's the politically correct term for what they're doing.
[3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:48.840]  They're spraying this garbage. I'm sure it's got aluminum.
[3:01:48.840 --> 3:01:52.840]  And they treat it like animals like, oh, it's not even going on. Don't even look at it.
[3:01:52.840 --> 3:01:57.840]  I mean, with aluminum barium, that stuff gets in the soil, it kills the microbes.
[3:01:57.840 --> 3:02:01.840]  So they're literally killing the soil when this stuff reaches the ground.
[3:02:01.840 --> 3:02:05.840]  So anyways, I was hoping maybe you can pull that up and I don't have time today.
[3:02:05.840 --> 3:02:10.840]  But if you can bring up that Fox News report, they have the video.
[3:02:10.840 --> 3:02:11.840]  They have video.
[3:02:11.840 --> 3:02:19.840]  There's making it rain. Drones can be the future for cloud seeding Fox News five years ago.
[3:02:19.840 --> 3:02:23.840]  All right. Thank you so much, Emmanuel. Amazing point. Thanks for holding.
[3:02:23.840 --> 3:02:28.840]  Turk in the FEMA region nine last caller, the next phase of the info war.
[3:02:28.840 --> 3:02:30.840]  Tell us about it.
[3:02:30.840 --> 3:02:32.840]  Hey, thanks for having me, Alex.
[3:02:32.840 --> 3:02:38.840]  Hey, man, so I keep on here and not only when people call into you, but everywhere.
[3:02:38.840 --> 3:02:43.840]  Just keep asking like, what can I do? What can I do?
[3:02:43.840 --> 3:02:47.840]  And Alex, I'm calling it to get you an idea of what we can do.
[3:02:47.840 --> 3:02:52.840]  And it's time for people to step out of the metaverse and step into the arena.
[3:02:52.840 --> 3:02:57.840]  It's time to get people off the couch and have them step into the arena.
[3:02:57.840 --> 3:03:02.840]  And what we've developed is an organizing construct that can partner.
[3:03:02.840 --> 3:03:06.840]  I've sent you your show tips. I've sent it to your advertising guys.
[3:03:06.840 --> 3:03:11.840]  We want to pay you, Alex, with the NFT project that is going to do this.
[3:03:11.840 --> 3:03:15.840]  It's an organizing construct that will do coalition building.
[3:03:15.840 --> 3:03:19.840]  We get in, we partnership with medical and legal advocates,
[3:03:19.840 --> 3:03:22.840]  and we start working with them to document research.
[3:03:22.840 --> 3:03:27.840]  The people will be cast through this gamification of political action.
[3:03:27.840 --> 3:03:32.840]  And what they'll be able to do, Alex, is they'll be able to find, document,
[3:03:32.840 --> 3:03:38.840]  cite, and organize information on COVID related crimes, criminals, and injuries.
[3:03:38.840 --> 3:03:41.840]  Okay, is there an end site? Where do I find out about this?
[3:03:41.840 --> 3:03:45.840]  This is called Step Into The Arena Game.
[3:03:45.840 --> 3:03:49.840]  StepIntoTheArenaGame.com. Alex, put your people on it.
[3:03:49.840 --> 3:03:52.840]  We want to pay you hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[3:03:52.840 --> 3:03:55.840]  We can make this happen and to keep the info running.
[3:03:55.840 --> 3:03:57.840]  But this is what it does.
[3:03:57.840 --> 3:04:01.840]  It's not just to advertise and sell products.
[3:04:01.840 --> 3:04:03.840]  What this does is it organizes people.
[3:04:03.840 --> 3:04:07.840]  It gets them into the game and puts them on the offensive.
[3:04:07.840 --> 3:04:14.840]  We set out real, in real life missions for them to take on and go after these COVID.
[3:04:14.840 --> 3:04:16.840]  And you're on people to get a mission.
[3:04:16.840 --> 3:04:18.840]  All right, Turk, I appreciate your call.

[3:16:22.840 --> 3:16:27.840]  The first ten amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791.
[3:16:27.840 --> 3:16:32.840]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press.
[3:16:32.840 --> 3:16:41.840]  Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference and restraint by the government.
[3:16:41.840 --> 3:16:48.840]  231 years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious attack.
[3:16:48.840 --> 3:16:55.840]  CCN is under attack. Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not want you to know the truth.

[3:17:21.840 --> 3:17:27.840]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:17:27.840 --> 3:17:31.840]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:31.840 --> 3:17:37.840]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[3:18:49.840 --> 3:18:52.840]  Thanks for being part of the tip of the spear.
[3:18:52.840 --> 3:18:58.840]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[3:18:58.840 --> 3:19:05.840]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated? Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming. I tried to stop it.
[3:19:05.840 --> 3:19:16.840]  And now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents.
[3:19:16.840 --> 3:19:24.840]  It's now out in the open. Claw Schwab said last week that they rule the earth. The Bilderberg Group founded Davos Group.
[3:19:24.840 --> 3:19:30.840]  So now the fight's out in the open. They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[3:19:30.840 --> 3:19:33.840]  We're going to win this thing. God's watching. The children are counting on us.
[3:19:33.840 --> 3:19:40.840]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[3:19:40.840 --> 3:19:47.840]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[3:19:47.840 --> 3:19:55.840]  I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[3:20:18.840 --> 3:20:32.840]  So both day pride activists and indeed the U.S. Marines are now literally fulfilling memes in their desperation to virtue signal and one of everyone else.
[3:20:32.840 --> 3:20:36.840]  This is also happening with the Ukrainian military, by the way.
[3:20:36.840 --> 3:20:42.840]  Of course, we have the Azov Battalion, which the media now claims was never far right neo-Nazi.
[3:20:42.840 --> 3:20:47.840]  Now that there are neo-Nazis, drop the Nazi insignia from their uniform.
[3:20:47.840 --> 3:20:53.840]  We have this headline, media hypes new unicorn LGBTQ patch for Ukrainian troops.
[3:20:53.840 --> 3:20:57.840]  They have adopted this unicorn LGBTQ patch.
[3:20:57.840 --> 3:21:06.840]  I guess if the goons who raid people's houses and arrest them for criticizing Zelensky in Ukraine because it's such a democratic country.
[3:21:06.840 --> 3:21:12.840]  I guess if they wear gay unicorns on their uniforms, then that might make that okay too.
[3:21:12.840 --> 3:21:18.840]  Meanwhile, the WHO says gay pride event should go ahead despite monkeypox threat.
[3:21:18.840 --> 3:21:24.840]  Now, of course, experts have said that this monkeypox outbreak originated in two places in Europe,
[3:21:24.840 --> 3:21:31.840]  mainly a gay sauna in Spain and a fetish festival in Belgium because homosexuality is such a healthy lifestyle.
[3:21:31.840 --> 3:21:38.840]  But again, just as they said during the George Floyd riots in late May, June 2020,
[3:21:38.840 --> 3:21:42.840]  remember those public health officials literally coming out and saying,
[3:21:42.840 --> 3:21:46.840]  no, racism is a bigger public health threat than COVID.
[3:21:46.840 --> 3:21:48.840]  So we're going to lock you down.
[3:21:48.840 --> 3:21:50.840]  We're going to prevent you from seeing your loved ones.
[3:21:50.840 --> 3:21:53.840]  We're going to stop you from going to your grandma's funeral.
[3:21:53.840 --> 3:21:58.840]  We're going to stop you getting diabetes and cancer treatment that's going to kill you in two years time.
[3:21:58.840 --> 3:22:05.840]  Well, those BLM supporters know they can mass congregate in numbers of thousands of thousands in major cities
[3:22:05.840 --> 3:22:07.840]  because that's more important.
[3:22:07.840 --> 3:22:10.840]  Well, they've done it again.
[3:22:10.840 --> 3:22:15.840]  World Health Organization says global mass gathering events planned for gay pride month shouldn't be cancelled
[3:22:15.840 --> 3:22:21.840]  despite the fact that experts say monkeypox is circulating largely amongst LGBT people.
[3:22:21.840 --> 3:22:27.840]  They've literally said top health experts in the UK to gay people risking stigmatization
[3:22:27.840 --> 3:22:29.840]  don't have sex with each other.
[3:22:29.840 --> 3:22:32.840]  But now the WHO is saying go out and mass congregate
[3:22:32.840 --> 3:22:36.840]  despite the fact that it's transmitted by close proximity.
[3:22:36.840 --> 3:22:39.840]  Contact absolutely incredible.
[3:22:39.840 --> 3:22:42.840]  Let's shift gears now, though, because I want to talk about this in some more depth.
[3:22:42.840 --> 3:22:43.840]  Let's go to this video.
[3:22:43.840 --> 3:22:45.840]  I'll come back and talk about it.
[3:22:45.840 --> 3:22:52.840]  What really happened before the Champions League final this past weekend, which the media buried?
[3:22:52.840 --> 3:22:53.840]  Let's go to this clip.
[3:22:53.840 --> 3:22:59.840]  Chaotic scenes at the weekend before the Champions League final in Paris between Liverpool and Real Madrid.
[3:22:59.840 --> 3:23:05.840]  So-called Liverpool supporters rushed security and tried to enter the stadium without tickets or with fake tickets.
[3:23:05.840 --> 3:23:11.840]  French police responded by tear-gassing innocent supporters, many of whom hadn't even tried to enter illegally.
[3:23:11.840 --> 3:23:16.840]  That's what we were told by the media, but the first part didn't even happen.
[3:23:16.840 --> 3:23:23.840]  Exactly who was responsible for causing the chaos has been buried by media outlets in the UK.
[3:23:23.840 --> 3:23:31.840]  Here's who really rushed security entering the stadium illegally while also being responsible for countless violent assaults and robberies.
[3:23:36.840 --> 3:23:39.840]  They don't look like Liverpool supporters to me.
[3:23:39.840 --> 3:23:47.840]  Take another look.
[3:23:47.840 --> 3:23:55.840]  They look like North African and Middle Eastern migrants, which would make sense because Sandini, the area where the Stade de France is located,
[3:23:55.840 --> 3:24:00.840]  is one giant ethnic suburb where migrant gangs rule the roost.
[3:24:00.840 --> 3:24:07.840]  In fact, it's estimated a whopping 400,000 illegal immigrants live in the Sandini area of Paris alone.
[3:24:07.840 --> 3:24:15.840]  At least hundreds, maybe even thousands, saw the 50,000 tourists visiting to watch the game as easy prey.
[3:24:15.840 --> 3:24:22.840]  You can watch numerous videos of people of a certain demographic assaulting Liverpool supporters in the link below,
[3:24:22.840 --> 3:24:29.840]  and how did the French government respond by blaming the English football fans who were actually the victims of the chaos?
[3:24:29.840 --> 3:24:34.840]  How did the French riot police respond by attacking English football fans?
[3:24:34.840 --> 3:25:02.840]  The French media responded by running cover for the true perpetrators.
[3:25:02.840 --> 3:25:08.840]  Like in the USSR, the population deciphers the lies of the government and the media said philosopher Matthew Bock Coating.
[3:25:08.840 --> 3:25:15.840]  When they say a young person or a sensitive neighborhood, we all spontaneously understand what they're talking about.
[3:25:15.840 --> 3:25:20.840]  The mayor of Liverpool, who was personally attacked and had his cell phone stolen,
[3:25:20.840 --> 3:25:25.840]  lambasted UEFA and French authorities for falsely blaming Liverpool fans.
[3:25:25.840 --> 3:25:33.840]  It was falsely claimed that Liverpool fans arrived late when footage shows that the vast majority of them were there several hours before the game began,
[3:25:33.840 --> 3:25:35.840]  and many were refused entry.
[3:25:35.840 --> 3:25:41.840]  Meanwhile, organized crime gangs with fake tickets or no tickets at all were literally allowed to run riot.
[3:25:41.840 --> 3:25:47.840]  There were young people from the suburbs who were friends with the attackers, said French sports journalist Daniel Riolo.
[3:25:47.840 --> 3:25:56.840]  At least 1,000 thieves, robbers and bandits assaulted families through people to the ground, took everything from them, leaving people outside, unable to attend the game, he added.
[3:25:56.840 --> 3:26:08.840]  According to many witnesses and as can be seen on video circulating online, the same stewards who blocked the entrance to fans with real tickets were also letting in people who seemed to be neighborhood residents they knew
[3:26:08.840 --> 3:26:12.840]  and who clearly did not have tickets for the game, reports Remix News.
[3:26:12.840 --> 3:26:18.840]  Gregory Goupille, Secretary General of the Alliance 93 Police Union, told News Channel TF1 Info,
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:25.840]  colleagues have told us they had never seen so many unaccompanied minors, mostly North Africans, clustered and hyperactive.
[3:26:25.840 --> 3:26:33.840]  One thing is certain, pickpockets came in droves to steal cash, wallets or phones, sometimes even from the visually impaired or people in wheelchairs.
[3:26:33.840 --> 3:26:41.840]  Slimes made by the French Interior Minister that half of the arrests made were of Liverpool supporters were also later completely discredited.
[3:26:41.840 --> 3:26:45.840]  National rally leader Marine Le Pen summarized what really happened.
[3:26:45.840 --> 3:26:49.840]  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has lied and continues to lie.
[3:26:49.840 --> 3:26:57.840]  He explains that he did not see what foreign journalists and fans on site saw very well, that is to say a horde of criminals who came to loot and assault people.
[3:26:57.840 --> 3:27:02.840]  The events that took place at the Stade de France are an allegory of all the dangers that weigh on France.
[3:27:02.840 --> 3:27:07.840]  Today we are unable to organize large events, keeping them free of violence and abuse.
[3:27:07.840 --> 3:27:17.840]  And the media covered it all up, just like they tried to cover up what happened on New Year's Eve in Cologne in 2015, which was perpetrated by the exact same demographic.
[3:27:17.840 --> 3:27:24.840]  The same demographic, which will be around to cause similar chaos when Stade de France hosts the Olympic Games in 2024.
[3:27:24.840 --> 3:27:32.840]  It's really becoming difficult, isn't it, for them to protect the increasingly tenuous narrative that diversity is a strength.
[3:27:32.840 --> 3:27:42.840]  Now, this final was originally planned to be held in St. Petersburg, Russia, where they don't have similar bountiful joys of diversity.
[3:27:42.840 --> 3:27:44.840]  Of course, that got cancelled because poosed in bad.
[3:27:44.840 --> 3:27:48.840]  It took place in Sandinique, 400,000 illegal immigrants.
[3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:51.840]  It's one of these notorious no-go zone migrant suburbs.
[3:27:51.840 --> 3:27:53.840]  And basically all hell broke loose.
[3:27:53.840 --> 3:27:58.840]  I didn't even know about this until like three days after it happened.
[3:27:58.840 --> 3:28:04.840]  I even bought the mainstream media narrative that it was Liverpool football fans without tickets.
[3:28:04.840 --> 3:28:05.840]  It wasn't.
[3:28:05.840 --> 3:28:06.840]  They were actually the victims.
[3:28:06.840 --> 3:28:14.840]  There's now an investigation into overreach, police brutality by the French cops for teargassing the supporters.
[3:28:14.840 --> 3:28:21.840]  There's no investigation into the actual perpetrators, the people behind this bedlam, because that would be racist.
[3:28:21.840 --> 3:28:22.840]  We have an article.
[3:28:22.840 --> 3:28:27.840]  They found out fear amusing football fans targeted by migrant gangs.
[3:28:27.840 --> 3:28:31.840]  French Spanish journalist Alejo Shapira said,
[3:28:31.840 --> 3:28:36.840]  the official version of the French authorities, the problems in the Stade de France were because there were too many Englishmen with false tickets.
[3:28:36.840 --> 3:28:44.840]  However, the testimony is that the scene give accounts of robberies groping by locals from the no-go zone and police disorganization.
[3:28:44.840 --> 3:28:47.840]  It's the usual suspects yet again.
[3:28:47.840 --> 3:28:48.840]  Summit.News will be back.
[3:28:48.840 --> 3:28:49.840]  Don't go away.
[3:28:49.840 --> 3:28:54.840]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me.
[3:28:54.840 --> 3:29:04.840]  And it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly, for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[3:29:04.840 --> 3:29:05.840]  And we're all in this together.
[3:29:05.840 --> 3:29:09.840]  And you know, it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products.
[3:29:09.840 --> 3:29:11.840]  Please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:29:11.840 --> 3:29:12.840]  But it's true.
[3:29:12.840 --> 3:29:18.840]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:29:18.840 --> 3:29:20.840]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:29:20.840 --> 3:29:22.840]  They crippled all the other groups.
[3:29:22.840 --> 3:29:23.840]  And we're still here.
[3:29:23.840 --> 3:29:27.840]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[3:29:27.840 --> 3:29:29.840]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:29:29.840 --> 3:29:31.840]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:29:31.840 --> 3:29:33.840]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved.
[3:29:33.840 --> 3:29:35.840]  And America still was not free.
[3:29:35.840 --> 3:29:37.840]  You can't have info wars has been proven right.
[3:29:37.840 --> 3:29:40.840]  Be it on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[3:29:40.840 --> 3:29:43.840]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:29:43.840 --> 3:29:49.840]  So thank you all and get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much more.
[3:29:49.840 --> 3:29:51.840]  They're wonderful products and they support the info war.
[3:29:51.840 --> 3:29:52.840]  Thank you.
[3:29:52.840 --> 3:29:56.840]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in info wars live products.
[3:29:56.840 --> 3:30:00.840]  And that's why for more than two years we've been sold out of ultimate bone broth.
[3:30:00.840 --> 3:30:03.840]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now.
[3:30:03.840 --> 3:30:07.840]  And we have reformulated and not just use the same ingredients.
[3:30:07.840 --> 3:30:09.840]  We've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[3:30:09.840 --> 3:30:13.840]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you this is next level.
[3:30:13.840 --> 3:30:14.840]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[3:30:14.840 --> 3:30:19.840]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[3:30:19.840 --> 3:30:24.840]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder,
[3:30:24.840 --> 3:30:29.840]  and a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants.
[3:30:29.840 --> 3:30:33.840]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium and sodium added.
[3:30:33.840 --> 3:30:36.840]  I mean this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[3:30:36.840 --> 3:30:41.840]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[3:30:41.840 --> 3:30:43.840]  And it just goes on and on.
[3:30:43.840 --> 3:30:44.840]  It is now back in stock.
[3:30:44.840 --> 3:30:52.840]  Ultimate bone broth plus available at 20% off and free shipping out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[3:30:52.840 --> 3:30:56.840]  Back in stock, down and out liquid sleep support.
[3:30:56.840 --> 3:30:58.840]  It's been out of stock for a while.
[3:30:58.840 --> 3:31:01.840]  It's one of three sleep aids we have at infowarstore.com.
[3:31:01.840 --> 3:31:03.840]  This one has been very popular.
[3:31:03.840 --> 3:31:04.840]  It's sold off the shelves.
[3:31:04.840 --> 3:31:08.840]  It's back in stock, down and out liquid sleep support.
[3:31:08.840 --> 3:31:14.840]  This is probably the strongest sleep aid that we have, I would say.
[3:31:14.840 --> 3:31:18.840]  Knockout, rocket rest, both great, comes in pill form.
[3:31:18.840 --> 3:31:22.840]  This is the liquid tincture and I think this is probably the most powerful one.
[3:31:22.840 --> 3:31:24.840]  Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine.
[3:31:24.840 --> 3:31:29.840]  This is, if you haven't done an iodine challenge yet, if you haven't done the iodine challenge,
[3:31:29.840 --> 3:31:31.840]  what are you waiting for now is the time.

[3:31:43.840 --> 3:31:44.840]  It's very popular.

[3:33:17.840 --> 3:33:31.840]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom.
[3:33:31.840 --> 3:33:33.840]  It's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:33:33.840 --> 3:33:41.840]  Well, just talk about what is happening in ethnic suburbs of France with these huge numbers
[3:33:41.840 --> 3:33:46.840]  of unintegrated migrants and the chaos they caused before the Champions League final.
[3:33:46.840 --> 3:33:50.840]  In Paris, again, it was in Paris, but it was in an area of Paris.
[3:33:50.840 --> 3:33:56.680]  The stadium is located in an area of Paris, which is home to 400,000 illegal immigrants
[3:33:56.680 --> 3:34:01.700]  in that area alone, most of whom are from North Africa and the Middle East.
[3:34:01.700 --> 3:34:08.240]  I'm going to get on to talk about what's happening in Sweden with this latest experiences
[3:34:08.240 --> 3:34:11.840]  of female Ukrainian refugees in Sweden.
[3:34:11.840 --> 3:34:16.240]  And in fact, how now they're giving migrants who weren't even born in Sweden the right
[3:34:16.240 --> 3:34:19.540]  to vote, which of course is the ultimate goal.
[3:34:19.540 --> 3:34:22.540]  But first we're going to go to this video, we're going to tell you what happened here
[3:34:22.540 --> 3:34:30.520]  in the UK to a village which comprises just 700 residents when the government suddenly
[3:34:30.520 --> 3:34:38.080]  announced with zero consultation whatsoever, they were never asked that 1500 economic migrants
[3:34:38.080 --> 3:34:41.440]  would be dumped on their doorstep.
[3:34:41.440 --> 3:34:46.200]  Here's the clip, what happened to this small village told to accept 1500 refugees.
[3:34:46.200 --> 3:34:50.960]  Here it is.
[3:34:50.960 --> 3:34:56.040]  Imagine you lived in a quaint, quiet village comprising of about 700 residents.
[3:34:56.040 --> 3:35:00.520]  Then imagine the government suddenly announced it planned to house 1500 North African and
[3:35:00.520 --> 3:35:02.800]  Middle Eastern migrants right on your doorstep.
[3:35:02.800 --> 3:35:03.800]  Oh s**t.
[3:35:03.800 --> 3:35:08.160]  That's precisely what could be about to happen to the residents of Linton on Ooze, a village
[3:35:08.160 --> 3:35:15.680]  in North Yorkshire, England, and suffice to say the locals aren't too happy about it.
[3:35:15.680 --> 3:35:22.160]  Like Catherine Dryden, who fears that an influx of bored young men is just asking for trouble.
[3:35:22.160 --> 3:35:26.160]  They are going to be bored out of their schools.
[3:35:26.160 --> 3:35:30.160]  There is no infrastructure in this village, we're a very small, tight-knit community.
[3:35:30.160 --> 3:35:34.080]  Yes, we will be welcoming them and speak to them, absolutely not problems, but that is
[3:35:34.080 --> 3:35:35.580]  not enough.
[3:35:35.580 --> 3:35:37.400]  What are these people going to do?
[3:35:37.400 --> 3:35:40.120]  But wait, they keep telling me diversity is a strength.
[3:35:40.120 --> 3:35:44.900]  What could these bigots possibly have against their village, suddenly doubling in size,
[3:35:44.900 --> 3:35:50.840]  swelled by ranks of new doctors, lawyers, culturally enriched by exotic, tasty new foreign
[3:35:50.840 --> 3:35:53.560]  food restaurants, would have a problem with that?
[3:35:53.560 --> 3:35:59.840]  A group of schoolgirls videoed as they were propositioned by a couple of asylum seekers.
[3:35:59.840 --> 3:36:00.840]  You know where 15 is?
[3:36:00.840 --> 3:36:01.840]  Yeah, how old are you?
[3:36:01.840 --> 3:36:02.840]  What's the number?
[3:36:02.840 --> 3:36:03.840]  You know where 15 is?
[3:36:03.840 --> 3:36:04.840]  Who?
[3:36:04.840 --> 3:36:05.840]  Us.
[3:36:05.840 --> 3:36:13.520]  Oh my, oh my, we're 15, you're 21 and you're asking for a snack, we're 15.
[3:36:13.520 --> 3:36:16.320]  I'm getting the word nuts.
[3:36:16.320 --> 3:36:20.960]  Oh, don't think that's the kind of cultural enrichment they were anticipating.
[3:36:20.960 --> 3:36:23.120]  Look at the size of this village.
[3:36:23.120 --> 3:36:28.640]  Linton on Ooze has one shop on the main road, just four buses run per day.
[3:36:28.640 --> 3:36:33.760]  Locals already wait weeks to get a doctor's appointment, much like England, Linton on
[3:36:33.760 --> 3:36:34.760]  Ooze is full.
[3:36:34.760 --> 3:36:40.520]  There's just no capacity to take in all these people, yet they plan to bus in migrants who
[3:36:40.520 --> 3:36:47.200]  will outnumber the existing residents by nearly three to one pure insanity, and all cooked
[3:36:47.200 --> 3:36:52.360]  up without any proper consultation with the local community, and just dumped on them.
[3:36:52.360 --> 3:36:57.000]  It's supposed to be a democratic society, but nobody's asking us, and now apparently
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:36:58.160]  they're arriving next week.
[3:36:58.160 --> 3:37:02.000]  And this week's announcement of a successful legal challenge will only put the plan on
[3:37:02.000 --> 3:37:03.840]  a temporary hold.
[3:37:03.840 --> 3:37:08.520]  Experts have been told by the government they'll get just seven days notice before any migrants
[3:37:08.520 --> 3:37:14.120]  arrive, and this isn't just a one-off case, it's the plan for the entire country.
[3:37:14.120 --> 3:37:18.320]  Under the asylum seeker dispersal program, the government has ordered councils to make
[3:37:18.320 --> 3:37:24.040]  more council housing stock and private rented accommodation available to house refugees.
[3:37:24.040 --> 3:37:29.400]  This at the same time that Britain faces a severe housing shortage crisis, with skyrocketing
[3:37:29.400 --> 3:37:33.760]  prices and limited supply making home ownership unaffordable for many.
[3:37:33.760 --> 3:37:38.920]  And endless sprawling housing estates being built on the edge of villages and greenbelt
[3:37:38.920 --> 3:37:44.080]  land that's supposed to be protected, placing further owner a strain on already creaking
[3:37:44.080 --> 3:37:46.920]  NHS infrastructure and other public services.
[3:37:46.920 --> 3:37:52.680]  Meanwhile, at a cost to the taxpayer of five million quid a day, the government is paying
[3:37:52.680 --> 3:37:57.680]  for these migrants to be housed in 30,000 hotel rooms a day.
[3:37:57.680 --> 3:38:02.320]  On the seafront in Eastbourne, this hotel would normally be home to some of the many
[3:38:02.320 --> 3:38:06.760]  tourists who visit this East Sussex resort.
[3:38:06.760 --> 3:38:11.440]  But these guests are not holiday makers, they're asylum seekers.
[3:38:11.440 --> 3:38:16.080]  Some of the tens of thousands were currently placed in hotel accommodation.
[3:38:16.080 --> 3:38:21.480]  And the authorities seem alarmingly paranoid about news reporters speaking to any of them.
[3:38:21.480 --> 3:38:26.200]  As we filmed, this home office minder filmed us.
[3:38:26.200 --> 3:38:31.640]  Another tried to persuade the guests to go back inside, and as I tried to speak to some
[3:38:31.640 --> 3:38:33.640]  of them, I was told I couldn't.
[3:38:33.640 --> 3:38:35.640]  They're not allowed to speak.
[3:38:35.640 --> 3:38:37.640]  Well, they are allowed to speak.
[3:38:37.640 --> 3:38:40.480]  No, they can't give any statement to you.
[3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:41.480]  That's official.
[3:38:41.480 --> 3:38:45.840]  You're telling us on behalf of the home office that these people are not allowed to speak
[3:38:45.840 --> 3:38:46.840]  to us?
[3:38:46.840 --> 3:38:47.840]  Is that what you're telling us?
[3:38:47.840 --> 3:38:50.960]  Meanwhile, our own homeless population is left to shiver on the streets.
[3:38:50.960 --> 3:38:55.760]  The majority of people sleeping rough in England are from the UK.
[3:38:55.760 --> 3:38:57.480]  No free hotel rooms for them.
[3:38:57.480 --> 3:39:01.720]  They'd be better treated if they hopped on a dinghy from France and came back pretending
[3:39:01.720 --> 3:39:03.520]  to be asylum seekers.
[3:39:03.520 --> 3:39:07.480]  Most of these migrant hotels are now completely closed to the public, because whenever they
[3:39:07.480 --> 3:39:13.440]  try to maintain parts of the hotels for use by tourists, and other parts for use by migrants
[3:39:13.440 --> 3:39:19.400]  like in Scarborough, let's just say the behaviour of the migrants makes the hotel's trip advisor
[3:39:19.400 --> 3:39:24.520]  and booking.com review scores plummet faster than a skydiver who forgot his parachute.
[3:39:24.520 --> 3:39:29.680]  One Sudanese migrant at a hotel in Glasgow expressed his gratitude by going on a stabbing
[3:39:29.680 --> 3:39:30.680]  spree.
[3:39:30.680 --> 3:39:34.080]  And no, that doesn't mean all migrants are out to do harm, and I don't blame them for
[3:39:34.080 --> 3:39:39.760]  wanting to come here, but it only takes a small percentage of a large number to cause significant
[3:39:39.760 --> 3:39:40.760]  trouble.
[3:39:40.760 --> 3:39:45.480]  The problem is that 90% of those that cross the English Channel are male.
[3:39:45.480 --> 3:39:51.840]  They are coming from cultures, in most cases, in which women aren't even treated as second
[3:39:51.840 --> 3:39:58.000]  class citizens, and that leads to fear and terror whether people are put in lintel nous,
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:40:01.240]  on Eastbourne Seafront, in Windsor, or wherever it is.
[3:40:01.240 --> 3:40:02.720]  And how did we end up here?
[3:40:02.720 --> 3:40:07.620]  Because under a conservative government that promised to drastically reduce both legal
[3:40:07.620 --> 3:40:13.600]  and illegal immigration, our border has more holes in it than a giant block of Swiss cheese.
[3:40:13.600 --> 3:40:19.960]  Last year alone, nearly 30,000 refugees arrived on boats on UK shores, where they were immediately
[3:40:19.960 --> 3:40:24.440]  given a complimentary taxi service and free accommodation by our border force.
[3:40:24.440 --> 3:40:27.320]  And those numbers are only set to increase.
[3:40:27.320 --> 3:40:29.120]  Hundreds more arrived in the past week.
[3:40:29.120 --> 3:40:34.040]  Nigel Farage warned 100,000 could arrive by the end of this year.
[3:40:34.040 --> 3:40:38.880]  The government has vowed to send a small number to Rwanda, and even if they get past all the
[3:40:38.880 --> 3:40:43.600]  lefty legal challenges preventing them from doing so, that's a drop in the ocean.
[3:40:43.600 --> 3:40:50.160]  There have been 4,850 landings since the Rwanda plan was announced back in April.
[3:40:50.160 --> 3:40:56.880]  200 more boat migrants arrived on Tuesday alone because there's no deterrent, only incentive.
[3:40:56.880 --> 3:41:01.320]  Both for illegal economic migrants and the people smugglers making a killing out of the
[3:41:01.320 --> 3:41:02.760]  entire racket.
[3:41:02.760 --> 3:41:06.800]  Many of them just rock up on the beach and run to the nearest town or village.
[3:41:06.800 --> 3:41:09.000]  Nobody has a clue who they even are.
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:13.560]  Instead of escorting the boats back to France where they came from, we treat their occupant
[3:41:13.560 --> 3:41:16.200]  like celebrities arriving at the ritz.
[3:41:16.200 --> 3:41:21.760]  And these aren't Ukrainian housewives, they're almost entirely young men from countries
[3:41:21.760 --> 3:41:51.240]  like Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan that aren't even at war, they're economic migrants.
[3:41:51.240 --> 3:41:56.720]  Another thing is it's a good news story, their mass protests actually worked at least temporarily.
[3:41:56.720 --> 3:42:02.600]  They've staved off this deluge of migrants being dumped on the village, but it remains
[3:42:02.600 --> 3:42:07.360]  to be seen what happens in the future because, as the government has said, it's only a temporary
[3:42:07.360 --> 3:42:08.360]  stay.
[3:42:08.360 --> 3:42:13.280]  Meanwhile, migrant crossings surging between Greece and Turkey's tensions rise, 40,000
[3:42:13.280 --> 3:42:17.880]  migrants since the start of the year have crossed from Turkey to Greece.
[3:42:17.880 --> 3:42:22.840]  But Erdogan himself has in the past admitted that he's using these migrants as a political
[3:42:22.840 --> 3:42:26.880]  weapon, where told diversity is a strength, he thinks they're a weapon, doesn't quite
[3:42:26.880 --> 3:42:27.960]  add up.
[3:42:27.960 --> 3:42:32.400]  As tensions have been mounting between Greece and Turkey, because Erdogan stated he would
[3:42:32.400 --> 3:42:36.640]  no longer conduct talks with Greek Prime Minister because Greece is trying to block the sale
[3:42:36.640 --> 3:42:41.600]  of American fighter planes to Turkey, so now Erdogan is threatening to blood Greece with
[3:42:41.600 --> 3:42:47.720]  more migrants cause another migrant crisis in retaliation, again, kind of suggests that
[3:42:47.720 --> 3:42:51.600]  diversity is not a strength if they're being used as a weapon.
[3:42:51.600 --> 3:42:52.600]  Summit.News will be back.

[3:43:56.800 --> 3:43:59.200]  rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire.
[3:43:59.200 --> 3:44:02.440]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[3:44:02.440 --> 3:44:07.320]  You see it every year, 30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns,
[3:44:07.320 --> 3:44:12.560]  50 different answers, and almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms
[3:44:12.560 --> 3:44:16.480]  and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general
[3:44:16.480 --> 3:44:19.040]  public understanding this and knowing this show.
[3:44:19.040 --> 3:44:24.560]  It's a very important situation with inflation, all the things out there hurting everybody,
[3:44:24.560 --> 3:44:29.760]  to be able to do things tax-wise that's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of
[3:44:29.760 --> 3:44:30.760]  your money.

[3:46:56.720 --> 3:47:08.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:08.080 --> 3:47:18.360]  Live from London England it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[3:47:18.360 --> 3:47:23.320]  So we've talked about France's problems with its vast hordes of unintegrated migrants
[3:47:23.320 --> 3:47:26.200]  mainly from North Africa and the Middle East.
[3:47:26.200 --> 3:47:31.320]  We've talked about what happened before the Champions League final with that group from
[3:47:31.320 --> 3:47:37.000]  the much-vaunted no-go zones that five years ago the media said didn't exist.
[3:47:37.000 --> 3:47:42.760]  We've talked about the UK government's program to disperse quote refugees of whom 90% are
[3:47:42.760 --> 3:47:48.720]  men and that's the majority are economic migrants out into the local communities including
[3:47:48.720 --> 3:47:54.320]  in a small village with 700 residents almost tripling their population and we've talked
[3:47:54.320 --> 3:47:59.120]  about President Erdogan in Turkey once again threatening to use migrants as a weapon to
[3:47:59.120 --> 3:48:05.720]  flood Greece because Greece is trying to block the sale of American fighter jets to Turkey
[3:48:05.720 --> 3:48:10.560]  then we see what's happening in Sweden and remember the great replacement is a far right
[3:48:10.560 --> 3:48:15.240]  conspiracy theory you're not allowed to talk about it unless you say it's a good thing
[3:48:15.240 --> 3:48:19.400]  which Joe Biden does and all the Democrats do then suddenly is a real thing and it's
[3:48:19.400 --> 3:48:27.840]  a positive development and the eventual agenda is something that we now see going on in Sweden
[3:48:27.840 --> 3:48:34.360]  where ethnic Swedes will of course that current trajectory be a minority in their own country
[3:48:34.360 --> 3:48:42.440]  by 2060 Breitbart reports Sweden population 10.3 million has over one million migrants
[3:48:42.440 --> 3:48:49.800]  eligible to vote for the first time in the 2022 elections and guess which way foreign
[3:48:49.800 --> 3:48:55.960]  born migrants living in Europe tend to vote well they tend to vote for left wing parties
[3:48:55.960 --> 3:49:02.240]  that give them more benefits what a surprise our total population just over 10 million
[3:49:02.240 --> 3:49:08.120]  people an estimated one million foreign born residents of Sweden will be eligible to vote
[3:49:08.120 --> 3:49:16.800]  in the coming national elections to be held later this year that's 200,000 people eligible
[3:49:16.800 --> 3:49:24.640]  to vote more than were eligible to vote in the previous Swedish national election Henryk
[3:49:24.640 --> 3:49:29.600]  Oskacson professor of political science said quote if you combine voting for the left party
[3:49:29.600 --> 3:49:35.440]  in the social democrats it's a clear red vote they vote left wing why do you think left
[3:49:35.440 --> 3:49:41.760]  wing parties want to import them in giant numbers because they really care about the
[3:49:41.760 --> 3:49:47.240]  refuge no they want power while foreign born residents of Sweden intend to vote for more
[3:49:47.240 --> 3:49:51.040]  for left wing parties and average compared to native born Swedes they also tend to vote
[3:49:51.040 --> 3:49:56.280]  less in elections overall 74% of foreign born Swedes vote compared to 90% of natives no
[3:49:56.280 --> 3:50:03.080]  doubt more of them can be convinced about but even so it's a huge number in the left
[3:50:03.080 --> 3:50:09.000]  favor that's why they import them in record numbers any chance they get of course there
[3:50:09.000 --> 3:50:13.960]  was an interest in study carried out in Sweden a few years ago where they found that virtually
[3:50:13.960 --> 3:50:19.360]  every left wing member of parliament of the ruling party did not live in a multicultural
[3:50:19.360 --> 3:50:26.240]  area of Sweden they lived in the whitest area of Gothenburg for example possible a similar
[3:50:26.240 --> 3:50:31.840]  situation you find here in the UK where often the most vocal virtue single as when it comes
[3:50:31.840 --> 3:50:37.440]  to mass immigration live in the whitest areas of London possible if not the whitest areas
[3:50:37.440 --> 3:50:42.880]  of the country possible I've talked about that many times before now talking about Sweden
[3:50:42.880 --> 3:50:48.880]  they continue to enjoy the benefits of multiculturalism as do the female Ukrainian refugees who
[3:50:48.880 --> 3:50:54.120]  have entered the country in pretty significant numbers over the past few months here's the
[3:50:54.120 --> 3:51:01.840]  video dress modestly for diversity where Ukrainian women in asylum centers in Sweden
[3:51:01.840 --> 3:51:09.200]  have been told to cover up because it might provoke a certain demographic is the clip
[3:51:09.200 --> 3:51:14.520]  that when the West imported all those female Ukrainian refugees it also imported a bunch
[3:51:14.520 --> 3:51:19.800]  of Islamophobic bigots Ukrainian women in Sweden warned not to dress in a way that could
[3:51:19.800 --> 3:51:24.560]  provoke Muslim men and there you were thinking the desperate primary care needs of people
[3:51:24.560 --> 3:51:29.800]  fleeing a war zone were more important than upsetting the feelings of Europe's new diverse
[3:51:29.800 --> 3:51:35.160]  demographic well think again Ukrainian women at the Galaxan Refugee Center in Olafström
[3:51:35.160 --> 3:51:40.840]  Sweden have been told not to dress in a way that could provoke men from other cultures
[3:51:40.840 --> 3:51:45.960]  who also live at Galaxan housing facility according to the Swedish newspaper Nyta Idag
[3:51:45.960 --> 3:51:52.440]  one refugee aid volunteer working at the facility said that the Ukrainian women made the mistake
[3:51:52.440 --> 3:51:58.760]  before the advisory of dressing like other European women they usually dressed like us
[3:51:58.760 --> 3:52:05.240]  you and me said Giutana Benson and that's a big no no this is Sweden after all which
[3:52:05.240 --> 3:52:10.760]  is now basically only a European country in terms of its geographic location after being
[3:52:10.760 --> 3:52:16.760]  warned that they were provoking horny migrant men into culturally enriching them the Ukrainian
[3:52:16.760 --> 3:52:21.240]  women have now covered up as we previously highlighted some Ukrainian refugees are refusing
[3:52:21.240 --> 3:52:25.480]  to be taken to multicultural Sweden because they fear for their safety they obviously
[3:52:25.480 --> 3:52:31.240]  never got the memo that diversity is a strength more bigotry was on display when female Ukrainian
[3:52:31.240 --> 3:52:36.760]  refugees complained about Muslim migrants breaking into their accommodation and attempting
[3:52:36.760 --> 3:52:42.120]  to sexually assault them how dare they having been one of the safest country in Europe 20
[3:52:42.120 --> 3:52:47.160]  years ago before mass uncontrolled immigration Sweden is now the continent's second most
[3:52:47.160 --> 3:52:53.800]  dangerous last year Germany's build newspaper ran the headline Sweden is the most dangerous
[3:52:53.800 --> 3:52:59.560]  country in Europe the country is routinely beset by violent riots staged by migrant youths but
[3:52:59.560 --> 3:53:06.440]  yeah if women just stop dressing like women maybe they'll all calm down and start being nice
[3:53:08.680 --> 3:53:13.480]  there you have it let's move on to some other news now though in the final four minutes of
[3:53:13.480 --> 3:53:19.560]  the show world economic forum urges people to eat seaweed algae and cacti to save the planet
[3:53:20.360 --> 3:53:27.080]  this was a twitter video they put out a few days ago where the wef technocrats urge people to ditch
[3:53:27.080 --> 3:53:34.120]  meat and other foods deemed harmful to the planet and instead consume climate beneficial foods such
[3:53:34.120 --> 3:53:40.360]  as seaweed algae and cacti of course we know what this is all about this is about lowering your
[3:53:40.360 --> 3:53:48.920]  living standards which they're now doing via food price hikes global food shortages caused by their
[3:53:48.920 --> 3:53:53.560]  support for the current thing of course they blame Vladimir Putin for it just like a Biden
[3:53:53.560 --> 3:53:59.240]  administration blamed him for the runaway inflation that was already happening way before the invasion
[3:53:59.240 --> 3:54:06.200]  of Ukraine of course the wef previously published two articles on their website which explored how
[3:54:06.200 --> 3:54:12.120]  people could be conditioned to get used to the idea of eating weeds bugs and drinking sewage water
[3:54:12.120 --> 3:54:19.000]  in order to reduce co2 emissions now you know what was not on the menu at the cop 26 climate
[3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:24.280]  change conference last year in scotland attended by many of the same people who attend Davos and
[3:54:24.280 --> 3:54:32.120]  the world economic forum they weren't drinking sewage water they weren't eating cacti seaweed or
[3:54:32.120 --> 3:54:40.120]  indeed bugs to lower their co2 emissions what they did do was fly in on a phalanx of private jets
[3:54:40.680 --> 3:54:47.240]  because it's okay when they do it you need to lower your co2 emissions you need to cancel
[3:54:47.240 --> 3:54:51.960]  that one international holiday you may be lucky to have if you can still afford it with your family
[3:54:51.960 --> 3:54:58.760]  per year they still get to fly in on private jets for these conferences eat the finest meat the finest
[3:54:58.760 --> 3:55:05.880]  quiz impossible while you're going to eat crickets grasshoppers and meal worms no word on whether
[3:55:07.560 --> 3:55:14.680]  sewage water or cacti or algae were on the menu at Davos last week or hasn't a guess that they weren't
[3:55:14.680 --> 3:55:21.400]  but again this kind of pod dwelling bug eating meme that the establishment continually pushes
[3:55:21.400 --> 3:55:27.880]  in the name of lowering co2 emissions we've mainly seen it via technocrats like the wef we've mainly
[3:55:27.880 --> 3:55:35.640]  seen it via quirky lifestyle pieces on cnn and stuff like that where we haven't seen it so far
[3:55:35.640 --> 3:55:41.000]  but we have now is in schools we don't have time to play this video i'll tell you about it
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:47.720]  it for schools in wales are now conducting a science experiment where they make kids eat bugs
[3:55:48.200 --> 3:55:54.200]  to save the planet but again they emphasize in this experiment the point of it is for these kids
[3:55:54.200 --> 3:56:01.960]  to then go home and bully their parents into ditching me into ditching other foods and eating
[3:56:01.960 --> 3:56:07.320]  the bugs again it's brainwashing the kids with social engineering in schools and then weaponizing
[3:56:07.320 --> 3:56:15.400]  the kids to use that brainwashing to pressure their own parents divide and conquer meanwhile
[3:56:15.400 --> 3:56:20.200]  lockdown advocates have been proven to be on the completely wrong side of history once again
[3:56:21.000 --> 3:56:29.160]  report more than 3000 diabetics in uk died because of covid lockdowns remember as i mentioned earlier
[3:56:29.160 --> 3:56:34.920]  while all those black lives matter supporters were not only allowed but encouraged by the media by
[3:56:34.920 --> 3:56:39.880]  the establishment indeed by the government to go out and congregate in mass numbers while you were
[3:56:39.880 --> 3:56:44.840]  told you couldn't go to your grandma's funeral or see your loved ones or get a doctor's appointment
[3:56:45.560 --> 3:56:50.680]  in another damning analysis of the impact of lockdowns it has been estimated more than 3000
[3:56:50.680 --> 3:56:57.720]  people in the uk alone with diabetes unnecessarily died because they were unable to get checkups
[3:56:57.720 --> 3:57:02.520]  telegraph reports an nhs study found a removed to remote health care and a reduction in routine
[3:57:02.520 --> 3:57:08.360]  care in the first 12 months of the pandemic had quote absolutely devastating consequences for
[3:57:08.360 --> 3:57:13.880]  diabetics resulted in them being pushed to the back of the queue again we don't even know the
[3:57:13.880 --> 3:57:21.080]  full toll yet of death from missed cancer screenings missed the heart disease screenings and all these
[3:57:21.080 --> 3:57:27.080]  other important checkups that people need it desperately to have those numbers are going to
[3:57:27.080 --> 3:57:31.560]  come out over the next six months over the next two years and they're going to prove once again
[3:57:31.560 --> 3:57:36.760]  that lockdown advocates as they scurry away with their tails took between their legs we're on the
[3:57:36.760 --> 3:57:41.320]  wrong side of history that's going to wrap it up war room is next summit dot news don't go away
[3:57:42.280 --> 3:57:48.600]  the internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan alec jones was right people ask what's it
[3:57:48.600 --> 3:57:54.200]  like to be vindicated well it's actually a very sick feeling because i knew this was coming i tried
[3:57:54.200 --> 3:58:00.520]  to stop it and now everything i've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[3:58:00.520 --> 3:58:07.240]  the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents it's now out in the open
[3:58:07.240 --> 3:58:13.960]  claus schwaub said last week that they rule the earth the bill deberg group founded davos group so
[3:58:13.960 --> 3:58:19.880]  now the fight's out in the open they're making their move because they know they're behind schedule
[3:58:19.880 --> 3:58:23.960]  we're going to win this thing god's watching the children counting on us i just want to thank the
[3:58:23.960 --> 3:58:27.800]  viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because
[3:58:27.800 --> 3:58:33.240]  without you info wars would not be here so you to really internalize the fact that you are the info
[3:58:33.240 --> 3:58:38.680]  war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance so i want to thank you and salute you again
[3:58:38.680 --> 3:58:45.800]  for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts the eugenicists over a hundred years
[3:58:45.800 --> 3:58:50.920]  ago were very public about their plans they financed these universities they ran full page
[3:58:50.920 --> 3:58:56.200]  stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda of new york times other major newspapers
[3:58:56.200 --> 3:59:02.840]  that the family as we know it is a bad thing and must be ended and the first step in that is getting
[3:59:02.840 --> 3:59:08.280]  women out of the household and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons
[3:59:08.280 --> 3:59:12.600]  and daughters and husbands is a bad thing and i was just sitting here tonight making dinner
[3:59:13.160 --> 3:59:17.320]  for my daughter my four natural daughter my wife makes dinner a lot of times but i like to make
[3:59:17.320 --> 3:59:22.120]  this well i love to make breakfast and literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for
[3:59:22.120 --> 3:59:28.440]  your family and be nurtured and then all sit down together and have the communal event and that's
[3:59:28.440 --> 3:59:34.440]  what the system is attacking and bombarded is our normal biological actions are coming together
[3:59:34.440 --> 3:59:40.280]  they really are sick evil scientific cult of filth and want to domesticate us and turn us
[3:59:40.280 --> 3:59:56.200]  into lab rats we cannot let this continue you're listening to the alex jones show
