[00:00:00.723 --> 00:00:17.473]  We have the energy being cut off, and the globalists then blaming Putin, when the main precipitant of it, the main perpetrator of it, the main causal effect in this, on record, was their lockdown policies.
[00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:26.538]  And then we said, then they're going to call for carbon lockdowns, but to do that, they're going to implement carbon rationing.
[00:00:27.646 --> 00:00:29.847]  And food rationing, because they've announced all this before.
[00:00:30.047 --> 00:00:31.048]  Well, how are they going to do that?
[00:00:31.348 --> 00:00:48.575]  Well, they're going to give you a universal basic income that is in a cell phone or in a credit card in the future, in a chip in your body, Klaus Schwab has said, and it will decide with programmable money tokens what you're allowed to buy and what you're allowed to do.
[00:00:48.595 --> 00:00:52.476]  And you're already seeing that everywhere with the SEGs and all of it.
[00:00:52.536 --> 00:00:56.378]  So, this isn't coming, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.370]  This is here.
[00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.370]  Patriots worldwide.
[00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.370]  In defense of human liberty, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:32.370]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news. Today.
[00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.769]  (slow motion sound)
[00:01:34.972 --> 00:01:42.737]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday, September 6th broadcast.
[00:01:43.557 --> 00:01:51.262]  I'm your host Alex Jones, and I am extremely honored to be here with you in defense of the future of humanity.
[00:01:54.124 --> 00:01:55.645]  Very honored, very blessed to be here.
[00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:05.086]  Ready to go to war with the New World Order, with information, with the truth, and you need to get ready to strap yourselves in.
[00:02:07.908 --> 00:02:10.190]  Well, the next phase of the Great Reset is here.
[00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:21.299]  Exactly as we told you it would unfold, it's unfolding, and we can tell you what the next phase will be, and the next phase, and the next phase, till the majority of us are dead.
[00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:22.680]  It's all official!
[00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:32.030]   So I'm like a tour guide, Telling you, you know, when you come tour, say, a national park or something, where the bus is going and where the stops are.
[00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.057]  And I would suggest we not get on the bus, but we're already on the bus, we're already gotten to a couple of the stops.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.141]  It's the New World Order.
[00:02:42.941 --> 00:03:10.234]   So, first they put their police state surveillance control grid in, then they release the virus, then they have the lockdowns that destroy the third world and collapse it, and further destroy the West, then they bring in sanctions that cripple the economy further and say this is good to lower people's carbon footprint, but because you're poor, even middle class people can't pay their power bills or their gas bills, the government's going to give you a universal basic income Through this hard winner.
[00:03:10.554 --> 00:03:21.358]  Oh, but now they're announcing it's going to be permanent, but you're going to have to accept a tracker system on your phone or a card that decides what you can buy with the rations.
[00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:25.200]  Ah, what energy you're allowed to buy.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.101]  What food you're allowed to buy.
[00:03:27.481 --> 00:03:28.401]  You will have nothing.
[00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:29.262]  You will own nothing.
[00:03:29.282 --> 00:03:29.922]  You will like it.
[00:03:30.202 --> 00:03:31.403]  You will eat the bugs.
[00:03:32.483 --> 00:03:34.524]  Oh, you will eat the bugs.
[00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:38.130]  And then the rest of the dystopia.
[00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.172]  So I'm going to lay out what's currently happening, and then I'm going to tell you what's coming next.
[00:03:42.232 --> 00:03:48.735]  And you can decide to get off the bus, or you can decide to go to the next phase of this journey to hell.
[00:03:49.975 --> 00:03:51.096]  This journey to Mordor.
[00:03:52.506 --> 00:03:58.031]  That's where we're being taken, and I see even all the mainstream news, even conservative sites can't really figure out what's going on.
[00:03:58.391 --> 00:03:59.452]  Oh, look at the idiots!
[00:03:59.512 --> 00:04:09.501]  They did sanctions on Russia, and now it's collapsing the economy, and now they've got to bail people out, and oh, the education system didn't work, so now they've got to bail people out of their student loans.
[00:04:09.621 --> 00:04:13.184]  It's all been a plan to break us and domesticate us.
[00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:19.272]  Because once they've got total control, they can dictate how you live and what you do and decide if you live!
[00:04:19.652 --> 00:04:20.432]  Good Lord!
[00:04:20.753 --> 00:04:22.473]  It's the New World Order Great Reset!
[00:04:22.873 --> 00:04:25.814]  Here's the bumbling puppet president, Biden, talking about it.
[00:04:25.854 --> 00:04:27.094]  We'll be right back after break.
[00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:31.475]  We are at an inflection point, I believe, in the world economy.
[00:04:32.035 --> 00:04:33.655]  Not just the world economy, in the world.
[00:04:33.675 --> 00:04:36.316]  It occurs every three or four generations.
[00:04:37.336 --> 00:04:45.864]  As one of the top military people said to me in a secure meeting the other day, 60 million people died between 1900 and 1946.
[00:04:49.165 --> 00:04:54.990]  And since then, we established a liberal world order and that hadn't happened in a long while.
[00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.512]  A lot of people died, but nowhere near the chaos.
[00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:00.114]  And now's the time when things are shifting.
[00:05:00.475 --> 00:05:04.218]  We're going to, there's going to be a new world order out there and we've got to lead it.
[00:05:04.578 --> 00:05:07.080]  We've got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.841]  So anyway.
[00:05:08.862 --> 00:05:15.107]  Thank you for joining us for the September 6th, 2022 Tuesday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:17.071 --> 00:05:22.014]  Coming to you from our embattled ATX command base in Austin, Texas.
[00:05:23.715 --> 00:05:25.256]  All right, here's what's going on today.
[00:05:25.276 --> 00:05:41.845]  We've got the top lawyer for one of the largest pro-life organizations in the country joining us in the third hour to track the battle against the child murderers and how California and other states are passing laws to kill babies even after they're born.
[00:05:42.816 --> 00:05:45.138]  And just how sick these evil people are and how to stop them.
[00:05:45.658 --> 00:05:46.338]  That's third hour.
[00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:52.723]  Second hour, I'm going to open the phones up on all these big topics and take calls and cover news and play clips.
[00:05:53.443 --> 00:05:58.967]  And in the first hour, I am going to cover much of these stacks of news that are in front of me.
[00:05:58.987 --> 00:06:00.067]  And they're all interconnected.
[00:06:00.488 --> 00:06:02.109]  They're all incredibly important.
[00:06:03.109 --> 00:06:08.753]  And we're going to be getting to as much of it as we can here today.
[00:06:11.582 --> 00:06:20.110]  I have a great frustration, and I'm just going to be completely open about this, because I think somehow this might get people to unlock their minds who are new listeners.
[00:06:23.033 --> 00:06:26.697]  The world government, the New World Order, is as real as night and day.
[00:06:27.438 --> 00:06:28.959]  It's as real as your mama and your daddy.
[00:06:30.601 --> 00:06:32.923]  It's as real as the blue shirt I'm wearing on my back right now.
[00:06:35.956 --> 00:06:45.123]  And it means to slowly cut your resources off with engineering crisis after engineering crisis that have all been pre-planned and all choreographed and all announced.
[00:06:46.264 --> 00:07:04.419]  And there's nothing more frustrating than to have the proof to know what's coming next, to be able to tell you what's coming next thousands of times, not because I'm magical, not because I have a crystal ball, but because the enemy thinks you're a dumb animal and is bragging to their own organizations how they plan to do it.
[00:07:07.116 --> 00:07:10.999]  And then if you do research their own documents and criticize it, they gaslight you.
[00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:29.831]  But the World Economic Forum came out last Friday and said there are lying people claiming we want global government and that we control governments and that we want to cut off resources and they need to be censored and shut up.
[00:07:31.308 --> 00:07:36.891]  Oh, and they also said, they're lying people claiming we're controlling governments and big tech and we're censoring.
[00:07:38.011 --> 00:07:40.032]  So, we want them censored.
[00:07:40.072 --> 00:07:42.974]  In fact, I meant to get to that Friday, and I never got to it.
[00:07:42.994 --> 00:07:44.334]  Can you guys pull up some of the articles?
[00:07:44.574 --> 00:07:46.155]  It was a press release by the WEF.
[00:07:48.056 --> 00:07:51.978]  WEF, WEF chairwoman.
[00:07:53.570 --> 00:08:07.981]  And then she gave an interview, but they also put a press release out, and they were, again, talking about, they claim we censor, they claim we're in control, they claim we want world government, they claim we want to turn off the resources, and the answer to that is, censor them and turn their resources off!
[00:08:09.903 --> 00:08:22.052]  I mean, you talk about gaslighting, I could sit here for 10 hours and just play you clips of them, we're gonna put chips in you, we're gonna break up your family, we're gonna take over your body, the post-human world's here.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.061]  You'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you will eat the bugs.
[00:08:27.962 --> 00:08:35.786]  And now everywhere, in public schools around the West, they're telling children, hey, your hamburger buns are made out of crickets.
[00:08:38.568 --> 00:08:40.349]  Yeah, there's one of the WEF's own releases.
[00:08:41.109 --> 00:08:42.069]  That was a few weeks ago.
[00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.531]  Solution to online abuse, AI plus human intelligence.
[00:08:47.392 --> 00:08:50.574]  But the press release on Friday was, there's disinformation.
[00:08:51.522 --> 00:08:52.663]  We don't have any power.
[00:08:53.043 --> 00:08:56.505]  No, you're just officially merged with the UN, given UN power.
[00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:03.088]  Unbelievable.
[00:09:03.388 --> 00:09:10.031]  So, let me roll out the big story here, and then when we come back from break, I'm going to drill into it.
[00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:19.951]  But it ties into all of these other reports here.
[00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:24.991]   We have the energy being cut off and the globalists then blaming Putin
[00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:32.671]   with the main precipitant of it, the main perpetrator of it, the main causal effect
[00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:38.991]  in this on record was their lockdown policies.
[00:09:37.409 --> 00:09:45.912]  And then we said, then they're going to call for carbon lockdowns, but to do that, they're going to implement carbon rationing.
[00:09:47.035 --> 00:09:49.236]  And food rationing, because they've announced all this before.
[00:09:49.416 --> 00:09:50.417]  Well, how are they going to do that?
[00:09:50.717 --> 00:10:07.945]  Well, they're going to give you a universal basic income that is in a cell phone or in a credit card and in the future in a chip in your body, Klaus Schwab has said, and it will decide with programmable money tokens what you're allowed to buy and what you're allowed to do.
[00:10:07.965 --> 00:10:11.867]  And you're already seeing that everywhere with the SEGs and all of it.
[00:10:11.907 --> 00:10:15.749]  So, this isn't coming, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.680]  This is here.
[00:10:19.822 --> 00:10:20.922]  And this is the whole future.
[00:10:21.003 --> 00:10:24.505]  And so I'm going to go through this next segment as quickly as I can.
[00:10:24.565 --> 00:10:25.345]  Just the latest news.
[00:10:26.946 --> 00:10:28.987]  And then I'm going to tell you what comes next.
[00:10:31.169 --> 00:10:32.830]  And by the way, they've told us what's coming next.
[00:10:34.391 --> 00:10:35.632]  And it is so horrific.
[00:10:37.032 --> 00:10:37.893]  So insane.
[00:10:39.834 --> 00:10:40.875]  It makes my head spin.
[00:10:43.937 --> 00:10:44.317]  China.
[00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:55.548]  India and other countries are already implementing climate lockdowns in their largest cities where they just go, hey, you know what?
[00:10:55.968 --> 00:10:57.348]  Can't leave your house the next two days.
[00:10:59.389 --> 00:11:01.129]  And China then said, how about for the next week?
[00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:04.450]  That was last year.
[00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.251]  Now, this year, they said, you know what?
[00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:07.992]  You can't leave your house for three weeks.
[00:11:08.472 --> 00:11:15.474]  And they have drones flying in between the apartment buildings, barking orders saying, do not leave your home or you'll be permanently detained.
[00:11:17.065 --> 00:11:18.005]  That footage is coming up.
[00:11:19.646 --> 00:11:24.628]  So this is dystopian upon dystopian.
[00:11:24.728 --> 00:11:25.448]  This is it.
[00:11:25.869 --> 00:11:29.990]  So we have this stack right here that ties into this stack.
[00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.512]  Super-rich preppers seek to save themselves from the apocalypse.
[00:11:33.932 --> 00:11:36.973]  The apocalypse, they're engineering a new type of war.
[00:11:38.034 --> 00:11:43.014]   But instead of going up to the space station while they hit us with a biological weapon, Because that's not feasible.
[00:11:43.514 --> 00:11:48.858]  They're building their armored redoubts in very remote areas for the big war that's here.
[00:11:49.938 --> 00:11:59.665]  And then when we're all wiped out, they will then emerge with their AI grids, their robot control grids, and have limited small technology complexes.
[00:12:00.246 --> 00:12:02.627]  The Earth will be a giant wildlife preserve.
[00:12:03.228 --> 00:12:07.151]  And then they will then begin merging on machines and colonizing space.
[00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:08.992]  That's the official plan.
[00:12:10.185 --> 00:12:19.407]  And if you just look up what Jeff Bezos says, if you actually just look up what Bill Joy says, if you actually just look up what Ray Kurzweil says, or Yuval Noah Harari, they're all saying it!
[00:12:19.607 --> 00:12:21.248]  People go, oh, they're just crazy people.
[00:12:21.468 --> 00:12:22.688]  No, they're in control!
[00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:24.149]  And they're doing it!
[00:12:25.049 --> 00:12:42.102]   And the coup de grace in all of this, what makes me sick, is to look at all the little mercenaries that attack us, and all the minions who will have no future, and are lying about us and attacking us for chicken feed, On a program path, on an attack path that will destroy them and their families.
[00:12:42.602 --> 00:12:47.707]  But they're too arrogant to admit it themselves, because they feel too good being part of the power structure, even though they're schmucks.
[00:12:49.769 --> 00:13:03.417]   Meanwhile, I have real talent and real charisma, and the enemy knew that a long time ago, and for 22 years, I don't know, 28 years, But for 20 plus years, I have been offered everything.
[00:13:04.257 --> 00:13:04.678]  Everything.
[00:13:05.158 --> 00:13:06.339]  The meetings with Kissinger.
[00:13:06.579 --> 00:13:08.120]  The meetings with George W. Bush.
[00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:11.142]  Hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:13:11.923 --> 00:13:13.824]  That's how real the New World Order is.
[00:13:14.244 --> 00:13:15.585]  I have a seat at their table.
[00:13:16.266 --> 00:13:18.828]  I can snap my fingers right now and join them.
[00:13:19.928 --> 00:13:21.289]  That's how real this is!
[00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.231]  These people are gonna kill you!
[00:13:24.452 --> 00:13:25.432]  Do you understand that?
[00:13:25.632 --> 00:13:27.394]  They're going to kill you!
[00:13:27.794 --> 00:13:29.135]  This is only the beginning of it.
[00:13:30.305 --> 00:13:31.766]  And I don't say, like, oh, I'm cool.
[00:13:31.826 --> 00:13:33.226]  I got invited to the cool kid club.
[00:13:33.467 --> 00:13:36.108]  You could put a gun to my head, I wouldn't go be with those people.
[00:13:36.428 --> 00:13:40.590]  The most empty, cold, reptilian-type individuals.
[00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:45.892]  I don't mean literal reptilians, but I feel like my soul's being sucked when I've been around these people.
[00:13:45.972 --> 00:13:47.233]  I feel darkness.
[00:13:48.374 --> 00:13:50.054]  And it's not them that's causing that.
[00:13:50.154 --> 00:13:52.135]  It's God is not in that area.
[00:13:53.636 --> 00:13:55.977]  God has been removed.
[00:13:57.198 --> 00:13:59.319]  Well, sweetheart, I don't want to be where God's removed.
[00:14:00.754 --> 00:14:06.418]  So, choose a side now!
[00:14:07.418 --> 00:14:11.401]  Our ancestors were too strong and too good for us to crap all over what they built!
[00:14:12.182 --> 00:14:13.222]  The planet's ours!
[00:14:14.163 --> 00:14:15.063]  Space is ours!
[00:14:15.444 --> 00:14:16.524]  The dimensions are ours!
[00:14:16.805 --> 00:14:17.805]  God gave it to us!
[00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:20.327]  And these people won't stand in our way!
[00:14:20.547 --> 00:14:21.908]  We're gonna smash them!
[00:14:21.928 --> 00:14:22.588]  Stay with us!
[00:14:23.789 --> 00:14:29.373]  Broadcasting worldwide, from Texas, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:14:31.764 --> 00:14:39.691]  Alright, I hesitate to tell you what's coming in the future and how they're gonna implement all this because I don't like to not tell you everything and it's a lot.
[00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:42.273]  But I think you got a pretty good idea now.
[00:14:43.354 --> 00:14:45.675]  The most dystopian stuff you can imagine and then some.
[00:14:45.695 --> 00:14:47.657]  Because these people are pure evil.
[00:14:49.318 --> 00:14:51.120]  But I'm gonna do my best in the next few segments.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.661]  Right now let's get into what's currently happening.
[00:14:53.522 --> 00:14:55.604]  Just look at these headlines then I'll talk about each one.
[00:14:56.965 --> 00:15:08.903]   Incoming Prime Minister in the UK Trust drafts colossal 130 billion pound, that's over 200 and something billion, plan to freeze UK power bills.
[00:15:09.563 --> 00:15:11.004]  Universal basic income.
[00:15:11.485 --> 00:15:16.348]  But you got to agree to signing on and being directed what you can do in the future.
[00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:21.172]  That's the plan of the Great Reset after they cut the energy and resources off.
[00:15:21.932 --> 00:15:24.975]  Controls to the food, as the UN said back in 1996, food is a weapon.
[00:15:27.475 --> 00:15:33.018]  Putin has pushed Europe into an inflationary depression, says European Union leaders.
[00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:38.381]  Putin has pushed Europe into an inflationary depression and currency collapse.
[00:15:38.881 --> 00:15:51.068]  So the globalists do global lockdowns, shut off the economy, give themselves tens of trillions in bailouts, and then turn around and launch a war against the Russians, which the Russians then took the bait and responded and came in.
[00:15:51.088 --> 00:15:57.961]   Then they put massive sanctions On all the Russian energy coming in, even though it supplies more than half of Europe's energy.
[00:15:59.262 --> 00:16:01.424]  And then lo and behold, they turn around and say, Putin did that.
[00:16:06.148 --> 00:16:09.010]  Putin hasn't even cut the gas off until today.
[00:16:12.073 --> 00:16:14.755]  But he did announce they're cutting the gas off today.
[00:16:15.315 --> 00:16:25.431]   Italy's Salvini breaks ranks in energy sanctions against Russia because they are Putting us on our knees.
[00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:26.672]  See that?
[00:16:28.593 --> 00:16:29.633]  Because we are on our knees.
[00:16:32.855 --> 00:16:43.499]  If you put sanctions on somebody, and they can't ship you oil, and then you start blocking part of the gas, and the prices go up, and now they're gonna block it all, so Putin said, fine, we'll just block it.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.160]  They're the ones that did that.
[00:16:48.722 --> 00:16:53.984]  Russia drops the hammer, halts gas flows to Europe, remain pipeline until sanctions lifted.
[00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.150]  Now here's the key.
[00:17:00.711 --> 00:17:14.395]  As Europe implodes, it plans radical intervention, including price setting, suspending derivatives markets, and Europe-wide margin call bailouts, and you read deeper, Zender Spiegel, you name it, with links.
[00:17:15.836 --> 00:17:16.656]  Zero hedge to it.
[00:17:18.137 --> 00:17:19.377]  Universal basic income.
[00:17:19.697 --> 00:17:21.998]  Oh, you can't pay for heating now?
[00:17:22.038 --> 00:17:23.279]  You can't pay for any gas?
[00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:29.134]   Well, We're gonna give you a little stipend from the government, but control comes with it.
[00:17:30.055 --> 00:17:30.897]  Oh, and guess what?
[00:17:31.318 --> 00:17:37.389]  The World Economic Forum just had its global leaders come out and pair it.
[00:17:38.576 --> 00:17:41.417]  Oh, it's ten bad winters coming.
[00:17:42.217 --> 00:17:44.358]  Oh, it's ten years you won't have energy.
[00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:46.318]  You will own nothing, you will have nothing.
[00:17:46.618 --> 00:17:48.739]  All these different energy chiefs say we're in a transition.
[00:17:48.959 --> 00:17:52.880]  They're banning gas cars, not letting us have new power plants, four electric cars.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.821]  It's all designed to collapse things while they pose as the saviors.
[00:17:58.142 --> 00:17:58.682]  Economists.
[00:17:59.102 --> 00:18:01.483]  Europeans are mad with anger and it will get worse.
[00:18:02.103 --> 00:18:02.983]  What did Klaus Schwab say?
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.802]  Viewers begin to cut off the energy, and then there will be an angrier world.
[00:18:08.122 --> 00:18:12.503]  And out of that anger, they will accept the Great Reset, and we can build back better.
[00:18:13.684 --> 00:18:15.625]  They're building nothing, but you starving to death.
[00:18:16.025 --> 00:18:22.167]  It'll be done incremental, and each time it gets worse, under Stockholm Syndrome, people will beg them, oh, oh, we'll do whatever you say!
[00:18:22.648 --> 00:18:29.710]  Takes the chip, eats the bugs, you'll get credits on card, you'll get to travel, you'll get to have funds again!
[00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.172]  Oh, takes the shot, you get to go outdoors again!
[00:18:35.774 --> 00:18:41.760]  It's all that clear, and they have memos and white papers saying, soon they will all take chips to buy and sell.
[00:18:42.381 --> 00:18:44.863]  Fussy wearable, and then onto the skin.
[00:18:48.007 --> 00:18:55.694]  And they say, get used to it, it's gonna get a lot worse, and the energy secretary and Buddha judge and all of them go on TV and say, this is permanent!
[00:18:56.615 --> 00:18:58.978]  This is a wonderful transition we're in!
[00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:03.778]  And that's the key.
[00:19:03.858 --> 00:19:13.243]  The UK announces 130 billion pounds to give people $2,000 a month to buy energy during the winter.
[00:19:13.283 --> 00:19:16.724]  But it goes to select groups that get the contract.
[00:19:16.744 --> 00:19:16.784]  Oh!
[00:19:17.805 --> 00:19:17.965]  Oh!
[00:19:20.046 --> 00:19:26.864]   Trillions in liquidity support is going to be needed As Swiss fins join Europe's bailout brigade.
[00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:36.932]  They're all announcing, even non-EU countries, that they need trillions and trillions and trillions to bail everybody out because they don't have food or electricity in many areas.
[00:19:38.373 --> 00:19:41.055]  And now suddenly, we're not going to have water in many areas.
[00:19:41.075 --> 00:19:45.118]  They're telling them in Europe, oh sorry, the water's all breaking down.
[00:19:48.737 --> 00:19:51.898]  And guess who's buying up all the water supply systems?
[00:19:52.579 --> 00:19:53.919]  Oh, a consortium run by Bill Gates.
[00:19:54.119 --> 00:19:55.660]  Oh, and guess why he's able to do it?
[00:19:57.981 --> 00:19:59.341]  We'll tell you about that coming up.
[00:20:01.542 --> 00:20:02.823]  By the way, I didn't see that on my list.
[00:20:02.863 --> 00:20:03.743]  I thought I sent it to you.
[00:20:03.763 --> 00:20:05.784]  I know I sent you guys a lot of stuff.
[00:20:06.684 --> 00:20:08.685]  I'll send it to you again during the break, but it's for next segment.
[00:20:09.565 --> 00:20:12.247]  Bill Gates and some insider trading with Congress.
[00:20:12.267 --> 00:20:12.787]  We'll get to that.
[00:20:12.807 --> 00:20:15.528]  Wonder what the future's going to look like.
[00:20:18.021 --> 00:20:25.183]  They've now announced these new smart cities aren't going to have showers or bathrooms in your apartment.
[00:20:27.204 --> 00:20:28.064]  They'll be communal.
[00:20:28.704 --> 00:20:30.585]  Oh, and there won't be any sex.
[00:20:30.605 --> 00:20:33.466]  You're like, that sounds crazy.
[00:20:33.486 --> 00:20:33.986]  It'll never happen.
[00:20:34.126 --> 00:20:34.586]  Oh, really?
[00:20:35.046 --> 00:20:37.127]  They won't have full grown men and girls showers?
[00:20:37.787 --> 00:20:40.628]  They won't have adults saying their children competing in children's sports?
[00:20:41.068 --> 00:20:41.708]  That's happening now.
[00:20:43.223 --> 00:20:50.065]  There won't be men winning all the women's championships from cycling to wrestling to soccer to rugby.
[00:20:51.365 --> 00:20:52.145]  Oh, it's all been announced.
[00:20:52.465 --> 00:20:54.386]  You'll live in a 250 square foot pod.
[00:20:56.226 --> 00:20:57.106]  That's if you're doing well.
[00:20:58.167 --> 00:21:02.808]  And then there'll be a communal bathroom at the end of the hall that men, women and children will all use.
[00:21:03.228 --> 00:21:08.749]  All to degrade you and humiliate you and encourage you to not have children.
[00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:12.650]  And you're not going to have children when you can't get out of a 200 square foot coffin apartment.
[00:21:15.404 --> 00:21:21.345]  But there'll be plenty of synthetic drugs and plenty of fentanyl and plenty of options to go euthanize yourself.
[00:21:22.006 --> 00:21:23.506]  And that's what Canada just said.
[00:21:23.566 --> 00:21:25.226]  They're encouraging people to kill themselves.
[00:21:25.566 --> 00:21:26.206]  Same thing in Europe.
[00:21:26.547 --> 00:21:28.027]  And a lot of folks are just going to opt out.
[00:21:28.067 --> 00:21:31.608]  You're going to see suicide go up 50,000 percent, I predict.
[00:21:33.268 --> 00:21:36.349]  You're going to see millions committing suicide in the U.S.
[00:21:36.529 --> 00:21:37.429]  a month alone.
[00:21:37.849 --> 00:21:39.810]  Millions in Europe long before 2030.
[00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:40.110]  Just watch.
[00:21:42.048 --> 00:21:42.869]  Record this now.
[00:21:43.049 --> 00:21:44.150]  We probably won't be on the air then.
[00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.611]  I probably won't be around then.
[00:21:45.851 --> 00:21:46.511]  That's okay.
[00:21:47.092 --> 00:21:51.034]  My conscience is clean, baby, because they're gonna kill you and your family.
[00:21:51.655 --> 00:21:53.316]  And those are the people that are lucky.
[00:21:53.356 --> 00:21:54.337]  I guess they'll commit suicide.
[00:21:54.597 --> 00:22:01.161]  Everybody else is gonna get lined up and shot up against walls or raped and killed in these leftist torture bases they're building.
[00:22:01.642 --> 00:22:05.905]  The COVID emergency centers that they're building all over the world, same specs.
[00:22:07.219 --> 00:22:14.321]  Giant re-education camps and the average scumball is going to go along with it because they'll be scared and want to be on the winning team.
[00:22:17.442 --> 00:22:20.623]  You will eat the bugs before they blow your brains out.
[00:22:22.644 --> 00:22:26.465]  That's if you're strong enough not to get some extra credits for your family.
[00:22:26.505 --> 00:22:29.946]  It'll be a nice little payout at first when you commit suicide to your family or the charity of your liking.
[00:22:31.006 --> 00:22:36.448]  Forgive me that I get excited when I start talking about how horrible the future is.
[00:22:37.836 --> 00:22:49.423]  I've become enraged because I've intellectually read their books, read their documents, seen them plan this for 30 years that I've been politically active, for 40 years that I've been researching this.
[00:22:50.784 --> 00:22:52.505]  Yes, I was researching this when I was eight years old.
[00:22:53.906 --> 00:22:54.926]  I've always been driven to it.
[00:22:55.647 --> 00:22:56.427]  It's my destiny.
[00:22:56.507 --> 00:22:57.288]  It's your destiny.
[00:22:57.308 --> 00:23:00.150]  We're all going to meet on this field of decision.
[00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.331]  You've got to decide which side you're on.
[00:23:02.351 --> 00:23:03.852]  And now we're here.
[00:23:05.089 --> 00:23:06.190]  And it really freaks me out.
[00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.691]  The next phase of the Great Reset is here.
[00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:19.235]  European Union, UK announced universal basic income in response to the collapsed economy caused by the COVID lockdowns and the sanctions on Russia.
[00:23:21.196 --> 00:23:26.358]  I'm gonna hit this in a moment and finish up with what's currently happening and then get to what's next.
[00:23:26.638 --> 00:23:32.841]  You notice I started getting to what's next, last segment, but what's insane is everything I said is right there on record.
[00:23:34.091 --> 00:23:36.891]   including the fact that they want to kill at least 90% of the population.
[00:23:36.891 --> 00:23:45.610]  We'll drill back into this right now.
[00:23:45.781 --> 00:23:47.462]  But first, let me just say this.
[00:23:48.142 --> 00:23:50.164]  Thank you for keeping us on air, viewers and listeners.
[00:23:50.184 --> 00:23:51.545]  You've done an incredible job.
[00:23:52.666 --> 00:23:56.629]  And we have been very, very close to having to lay people off and shut down.
[00:23:57.549 --> 00:24:12.794]   But a Conjunction of what I call miracles and also just good old-fashioned research and support has kept us on air.
[00:24:13.634 --> 00:24:21.316]  And we have a plan to stay on the air indefinitely until they completely pull the plug off the internet, which they're getting close to here in the next few months or few years.
[00:24:21.777 --> 00:24:23.057]  They can do it anytime, quite frankly.
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.523]  That's why you've got to get this information, record it, save it, and have it.
[00:24:26.723 --> 00:24:42.680]  Because believe me, if you've got these shows recorded in two, three years, and we haven't stopped what's coming, you're going to be in underground churches, in places, you name it, watching this, and it'll be FEMA camp if you've even got this information.
[00:24:43.501 --> 00:24:46.264]  I mean, this is going to be, I mean, guaranteed.
[00:24:47.461 --> 00:24:55.884]  If we don't back this down or slow this down, very soon, you're going to look back on these broadcasts and just say, oh my God, it's happening exactly like you said.
[00:24:56.264 --> 00:25:01.585]  Because again, the enemy has told us, my God, they said five years ago, you will eat bugs.
[00:25:01.805 --> 00:25:04.886]  And now in the US, Canada, all over the world, they're making kids eat bugs.
[00:25:05.526 --> 00:25:10.228]  They're banning cows in more than 50 countries right now, including the Netherlands and France.
[00:25:11.548 --> 00:25:15.229]  By 2030, they say the herds will be reduced to 10% of what they are.
[00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:16.830]  They're just taking over!
[00:25:20.014 --> 00:25:21.735]  I mean, I understand this is dystopian.
[00:25:21.835 --> 00:25:23.096]  I understand it's hard to believe.
[00:25:24.256 --> 00:25:28.479]  I would read this stuff 30 years ago and I just think that is just crazy.
[00:25:28.779 --> 00:25:38.904]  The UN is going to use food as a weapon and they're going to break up our families and make us live in pods and push euthanasia and all the stuff you see in Hollywood movies that's so dystopic.
[00:25:39.224 --> 00:25:40.725]  Why are all the movies the same?
[00:25:40.845 --> 00:25:45.508]  Soylent Green, The Matrix, because it's the damn plan of these people.
[00:25:46.738 --> 00:25:48.279]  And I gotta tell you, I think it's aliens.
[00:25:48.739 --> 00:25:56.422]  I haven't seen aliens, I don't have proof it's aliens, but it's just so organized, so evil, and so anti-human, and so sick!
[00:26:00.043 --> 00:26:00.644]  I'm digressing.
[00:26:01.884 --> 00:26:02.584]  I need to be calm here.
[00:26:02.403 --> 00:26:16.083]   99.999999999999999999 percent of us are going to be hurt by the new world order. Even the
[00:26:16.083 --> 00:26:20.324]   tiny group of maybe a thousand globals that think they're going to merge with machines
[00:26:20.324 --> 00:26:23.462]  are going to be betrayed by this thing they're working with.
[00:26:23.462 --> 00:26:33.463]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:26:24.822 --> 00:26:25.822]  Anybody can see that.
[00:26:26.222 --> 00:26:27.083]  Everybody knows that.
[00:26:28.604 --> 00:26:33.866]  Our people are so powerful and so dialed in, they warned us thousands of years ago of exactly what was coming.
[00:26:34.647 --> 00:26:41.390]  These things are organized like machines, but they're not us and they don't have connection to the higher dimensions.
[00:26:41.971 --> 00:26:43.411]  We are the advanced species.
[00:26:43.731 --> 00:26:44.672]  We are superior.
[00:26:47.719 --> 00:26:56.864]  And there is a process in our development and we're at a fork in the road whether we're going to let this thing take over or whether we're going to go with God.
[00:27:00.465 --> 00:27:01.586]  But I'm taking you to the end there.
[00:27:01.606 --> 00:27:02.926]  We need to go back to where we are currently.
[00:27:05.728 --> 00:27:10.250]  Banning cows, banning pigs, banning sheep from New Zealand to Germany.
[00:27:11.351 --> 00:27:11.811]  To Canada.
[00:27:13.392 --> 00:27:13.932]  Bill Gates.
[00:27:14.983 --> 00:27:18.164]  Rolling out announcements to start curtailing beef here in the U.S.
[00:27:20.084 --> 00:27:23.585]  Beef is what holds up all the farms and the infrastructure all over the world.
[00:27:24.005 --> 00:27:35.287]  If farmers didn't have cows in their local infrastructure, even if they don't raise cows, it's the farming and the beef and the meat infrastructure that has held local independent agriculture together.
[00:27:35.827 --> 00:27:41.728]  And the globalists want to erase that and bring in stuff that makes factory farms look humane.
[00:27:43.271 --> 00:27:48.916]  You know, I need to make an Endgame 2 and just make it like 3 hours long and just go through chapters.
[00:27:49.116 --> 00:27:50.617]  Here was their plan in the past.
[00:27:50.918 --> 00:27:51.938]  Here's where we currently are.
[00:27:52.219 --> 00:27:53.980]  Here's what they're going to do in the future.
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:58.604]  Just like the first Endgame was made, hard to believe, 15 years ago.
[00:28:00.366 --> 00:28:03.308]  And you watch it and people completely freak out because it's where we are now.
[00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:06.271]  See?
[00:28:10.054 --> 00:28:10.815]  This is so insane.
[00:28:12.844 --> 00:28:50.781]   The bottom line is they're undermining all the infrastructure, they're undermining the work ethic, they are programming the young people to not want to work, and making us opt in to being obsolete, while they put pressure on the producers with everything they've got to shut down independent producers, and of course they admitted That they did years of lockdowns in Australia, years of lockdowns in Europe, years of lockdowns in the third world, to destroy all the small businesses, to destroy infrastructure, to put people into debt, to massively increase suicide, to bring in world vaccine passports that will be the new global carbon tax, universal basic income, social credit score system.
[00:28:52.253 --> 00:28:57.278]  And now the Club of Rome, the Bilderberg Group, the Deimos Group, they're all announcing it.
[00:28:57.318 --> 00:28:58.319]  It's rolling out in Europe.
[00:28:58.519 --> 00:28:59.700]  It's rolling out in the UK.
[00:28:59.941 --> 00:29:01.102]  It's rolling out in Canada.
[00:29:02.583 --> 00:29:03.784]  It's rolling out in Japan.
[00:29:03.844 --> 00:29:05.286]  It's already rolled out in China.
[00:29:06.547 --> 00:29:08.088]  This is the digital change.
[00:29:11.312 --> 00:29:15.436]  And so they said your local business was not essential to destroy you.
[00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:22.071]  And to force adoption on to robotics and centralization to make us even more obsolete.
[00:29:22.231 --> 00:29:29.395]  And I see all the Bloomberg articles and all of them showing, well, the pandemic caused record move to lay off humans and bring in robots.
[00:29:30.256 --> 00:29:31.937]  It really helped the robot revolution.
[00:29:33.117 --> 00:29:39.341]  Robots really were failing and weren't being adopted, but this brought them over the edge and made stocks and robotics go up.
[00:29:39.801 --> 00:29:40.982]  And it's the same thing.
[00:29:41.122 --> 00:29:42.903]  Oh, VR, no one was adopting it.
[00:29:43.943 --> 00:29:45.204]  People got nauseous on it.
[00:29:46.502 --> 00:29:57.267]  But now, you're going to be made to work from home, and so you need to adopt it, and all these new companies with billions of funding are making their employees work with VR goggles up to eight hours a day.
[00:29:59.007 --> 00:29:59.748]  Oh, you want to work here?
[00:29:59.788 --> 00:30:00.788]  Put this on your head.
[00:30:02.409 --> 00:30:07.191]  Forcing you as an experiment into this system.
[00:30:08.826 --> 00:30:11.529]  That is designed to be anti-human.
[00:30:11.569 --> 00:30:17.175]  It's designed to make you depressed and alone and divided so they can take you out.
[00:30:17.476 --> 00:30:20.579]  This is a off-world attack.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.202]  This is an advanced attack.
[00:30:23.863 --> 00:30:28.608]  This is an attack that gets you to destroy yourself and opt into it until it's too late.
[00:30:32.017 --> 00:30:38.901]  I told you two and a half years ago it would cause mass starvation, collapse the third world, they would then announce carbon taxes, the next phase would be carbon lockdowns.
[00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:41.102]  And now it's here.
[00:30:42.723 --> 00:30:44.364]  And they're doing it by not letting you have energy.
[00:30:45.645 --> 00:30:48.387]  And then saying, oh this is good though, it will teach you to not have energy.
[00:30:49.547 --> 00:30:55.831]  You're not going to have that car, you're not going to be able to go on a vacation, you're not going to be able to have access to that medicine you wanted before, you're not going to have access to go where you wanted.
[00:30:55.851 --> 00:31:08.477]   But don't worry, there's virtual reality, and we'll incentivize you And we'll have all these cash prizes and all this fun and kids won't play at the park anymore and play football or baseball or basketball.
[00:31:08.777 --> 00:31:12.922]  They'll all win money and prizes and be stars in the metaverse.
[00:31:14.083 --> 00:31:15.605]  Opting in to not living in the real world.
[00:31:16.046 --> 00:31:17.568]  Opting in to being sucked into the matrix.
[00:31:17.928 --> 00:31:20.671]  Opting in to climb in the pods themselves!
[00:31:22.486 --> 00:31:36.816]  To where they don't even want to live in reality because that phone and that programming knows how to hit their dopamine receptors until they become an interface with AI, not to empower them, but to destroy them.
[00:31:39.298 --> 00:31:40.439]  Let me go back to this when we come back.
[00:31:40.459 --> 00:31:42.260]  Let me go back to where we currently are and I'll get more into the future.
[00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:43.241]  Trade ahead.
[00:31:43.261 --> 00:31:44.602]  But it is just absolutely hellish.
[00:31:45.182 --> 00:31:47.204]  And it'll be those of us that transcend it.
[00:31:47.224 --> 00:31:47.844]  We'll be right back.
[00:31:48.104 --> 00:31:49.125]  InfoWars.com.
[00:31:49.345 --> 00:31:50.266]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:31:51.846 --> 00:31:56.147]  Alright, I'm trying to calmly go over this, but here's what happens when I talk about the future.
[00:31:57.127 --> 00:32:01.668]  It makes my brain speed up so much because it's every sector.
[00:32:02.568 --> 00:32:08.029]  It's water, wastewater, the plumbing, everything.
[00:32:08.049 --> 00:32:09.389]  That's one of their main attack points.
[00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.310]  They're attacking the atmosphere with geoengineering on record.
[00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:17.151]  They are attacking our bodies with nanotech, with GMO, with these deadly shots.
[00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:22.071]  They're attacking the food production, its delivery system.
[00:32:22.651 --> 00:32:25.173]  They're socially and culturally and spiritually attacking.
[00:32:25.553 --> 00:32:39.161]  They're dissolving all the main institutions that were good, replacing them with destructive institutions that turn people into victims, so that they think the system can save them, when by increments, once it captures you in that paradigm, it actually destroys you, but slowly, so you never know what hit you.
[00:32:40.662 --> 00:32:42.143]  It's just insane what they've done.
[00:32:43.737 --> 00:32:44.738]  And it's a creeping death.
[00:32:44.938 --> 00:32:50.662]  And what's crazy is they brag about it, they give speeches about it, they admit it to themselves.
[00:32:51.483 --> 00:32:53.324]  And we know what their battle plan is, we know how to beat them.
[00:32:53.685 --> 00:32:57.568]  Here's one microcosm in the whole system.
[00:32:58.648 --> 00:32:59.909]  Here's one sector in it.
[00:32:59.949 --> 00:33:00.990]  It's bigger than a microcosm.
[00:33:02.251 --> 00:33:14.974]   The UN came out 15 years ago and said, we're going to go through Agenda 21 and get all the major governments of the world, if they want IMF and World Bank money, To adopt this new clean water system.
[00:33:16.714 --> 00:33:17.635]  Well, it's not clean water.
[00:33:18.155 --> 00:33:20.976]  It's toilet to tap, even if you have aquifer water or plenty of water.
[00:33:21.696 --> 00:33:26.858]  And so they can put more chemicals in it and control it more, and charge you a lot more.
[00:33:26.918 --> 00:33:48.763]   And then all the little municipalities, all the counties and small towns, they're not going to be able to operate because their old-fashioned water system that worked great, whether it came from a reservoir or from Glacial melt, or whether it came from an aquifer, it's going to be taken away.
[00:33:50.785 --> 00:33:56.891]  Because they make you, by law, run it through their system.
[00:33:58.232 --> 00:34:01.175]  And then I began to see all these small towns and cities go bankrupt.
[00:34:01.215 --> 00:34:13.882]   You wonder why in Michigan and Mississippi and Louisiana and even Texas and areas of Florida, And New York, all over, these small towns say, we're bankrupt, we can't supply you water.
[00:34:14.763 --> 00:34:25.929]  It's because there isn't enough money to buy the new systems that even for small towns cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:28.811]  Now there's a thousand facets to that.
[00:34:29.311 --> 00:34:43.036]   Bill Gates' consortium with the UN, his biggest vaccine money, hundreds of billions a year, They come in and say, we'll give your town a loan and give you the water system for a fraction of what it's mandated by federal law you've got to have.
[00:34:44.237 --> 00:34:49.221]  But you've got to agree to all these other smart things we want you to do, which is Agenda 21.
[00:34:50.982 --> 00:34:53.824]  Now we're going into Agenda 2030, the collapse mode.
[00:34:54.997 --> 00:34:57.578]  So that's why all over the country they're doing that.
[00:34:57.598 --> 00:35:00.220]  So you say, well, I'll just live in the country and have a well myself or rainwater.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.221]  Now they're coming out all over the U.S.
[00:35:02.301 --> 00:35:06.663]  or in Europe trying to restrict your water wells or not let you get water out of your creek.
[00:35:08.184 --> 00:35:12.266]  This is creating serfdom, feudalism, starvation.
[00:35:12.346 --> 00:35:12.966]  It has a name.
[00:35:13.266 --> 00:35:14.387]  It's called siege.
[00:35:17.813 --> 00:35:24.336]  And then you look at members of Congress, they're now investing in this company that Bill Gates has got, that's already done this in Europe.
[00:35:24.936 --> 00:35:29.758]  England sits on a giant, crystal clear aquifer, so does Scotland, so does Ireland.
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:33.740]  Unlimited water.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.121]  Water's always been free in the UK.
[00:35:37.082 --> 00:35:37.362]  Free.
[00:35:39.923 --> 00:35:49.371]   Now they're paying thousands of pounds a year in most cities, and they take The water and they run it through a toxification system and add the fluoride and the chemicals.
[00:35:49.751 --> 00:35:52.072]  England wasn't adding fluoride until about a decade ago.
[00:35:52.892 --> 00:35:55.273]  Now it's being put in all their water supplies.
[00:35:58.074 --> 00:35:59.054]  This is agenda 21.
[00:35:59.635 --> 00:36:00.915]  It's not about progress.
[00:36:01.095 --> 00:36:02.116]  It's not about the environment.
[00:36:02.776 --> 00:36:06.057]  It's about GMO and nanotech and poison water.
[00:36:09.078 --> 00:36:10.579]  So here's just a little one minute clip.
[00:36:11.769 --> 00:36:14.572]  With an online analysis of this, you can look it up yourself.
[00:36:14.592 --> 00:36:15.373]  It's dead on accurate.
[00:36:15.393 --> 00:36:15.713]  Here it is.
[00:36:16.434 --> 00:36:20.177]  Do you guys remember the story a few months ago about Bill Gates buying up all the U.S.
[00:36:20.197 --> 00:36:20.658]  farmland?
[00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:22.420]  Well, he's been getting busy again.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:31.529]  Over the past few weeks, Gates has been quietly accumulating a massive $86 million position in a company called Ecolab, which he purchased through his LLC, Cascade Investments.
[00:36:31.869 --> 00:36:34.090]  This makes him one of the largest shareholders in the company.
[00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:35.430]  Now here's where it gets interesting.
[00:36:35.911 --> 00:36:39.032]  Ecolab specializes in water treatment using facilities and chemicals.
[00:36:39.292 --> 00:36:43.033]  And at the same time that Gates was building his position in the company, I discovered that a U.S.
[00:36:43.073 --> 00:36:46.214]  Congressman named Alan Lowenthal also started buying shares in the company.
[00:36:46.374 --> 00:36:47.935]  So I did some digging on Alan Lowenthal.
[00:36:48.255 --> 00:36:51.295]   And wouldn't you know it, he conveniently sits on the committee for infrastructure,
[00:36:51.295 --> 00:36:52.974]  water resources, and the environment.
[00:36:52.974 --> 00:36:55.454]  This is the exact same industry that Equalib is in.
[00:36:55.454 --> 00:36:59.454]   As if that wasn't enough, the EPA just announced new chemical standards for water that would
[00:36:59.454 --> 00:37:01.773]  require major investments in a water treatment facility.
[00:37:01.773 --> 00:37:05.055]   So as of now, I'll definitely be keeping a close eye on this company.
[00:37:05.055 --> 00:37:09.294]   To see more data like this, check out my website and take care.
[00:37:09.294 --> 00:37:14.815]   You know, one time I was on a vacation about 10 years ago in High Springs, Arkansas, because
[00:37:14.815 --> 00:37:16.094]  I hadn't been there since I was a kid.
[00:37:16.081 --> 00:37:17.621]  My parents used to go up there at least once a year.
[00:37:18.041 --> 00:37:18.841]  Lovely old place.
[00:37:19.881 --> 00:37:25.643]  And there was a water treatment convention in the hotel, the Arlington, old hotel I was in.
[00:37:26.403 --> 00:37:34.825]  And I probably talked to a hundred people there who were managers from, it was from Tennessee, Arkansas, it was an Ozarks meeting from three states in Missouri.
[00:37:36.305 --> 00:37:40.106]  And they said, listen, Alex, we've got crystal clear aquifer in the Ozarks.
[00:37:40.166 --> 00:37:41.667]  They make us put fluoride in it.
[00:37:42.207 --> 00:37:43.528]  But you know what I had a bunch of them tell me?
[00:37:44.088 --> 00:37:47.489]  They said, Alex, we take that fluoride and we bury it.
[00:37:48.249 --> 00:37:50.290]  We don't put that in our community.
[00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:54.171]  But they told me more and more the feds are coming in to test it, make sure they're doing it.
[00:37:55.412 --> 00:37:57.172]  By the way, it's not just normal fluoride.
[00:37:57.212 --> 00:38:01.594]  It's hydrofluorosilicic acid and toxic waste that the government certifies as that.
[00:38:03.379 --> 00:38:04.039]  Look it up, folks.
[00:38:04.099 --> 00:38:06.801]  I mean, again, this is one facet of these people.
[00:38:08.062 --> 00:38:09.142]  That's agenda 21.
[00:38:09.522 --> 00:38:10.463]  This is agenda 2030.
[00:38:12.424 --> 00:38:13.525]  I'm going to get into agenda 2030.
[00:38:15.125 --> 00:38:20.908]  Actually, the first 15 minutes of the next hour, because I got behind here, and then I'm going to get all this other news, and I'll try to go to calls.
[00:38:20.949 --> 00:38:23.010]  I'm getting better about it, but I need to hit all this.
[00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:24.550]  That's why it's so frustrating.
[00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:30.534]  See, I just spent seven, eight minutes on that one topic, and I could go for days on that.
[00:38:32.375 --> 00:38:32.675]  Days.
[00:38:34.659 --> 00:38:37.442]  I mean, this is just the biggest damn screw job ever!
[00:38:39.445 --> 00:38:49.416]  You got crystal clear water, 100% delicious, millions of years old, under volcanic soil, coming out of the Ozark Mountains, and they can't have it.
[00:38:50.798 --> 00:38:54.723]  It should be free, just like in the UK, but now it's not free there either.
[00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:06.832]  And they're just raising generations of these high-rise people that think those of us that know how to skin a buck or run a trot line or know how stuff works, they think we're weirdos.
[00:39:08.652 --> 00:39:14.293]  Now hundreds of towns and small cities are announcing, we're not going to have running water now.
[00:39:14.653 --> 00:39:15.353]  You ask why?
[00:39:15.674 --> 00:39:17.714]  Because the feds will arrest them.
[00:39:18.734 --> 00:39:22.755]  Because they didn't put in the new systems they couldn't afford that toxify the water.
[00:39:26.741 --> 00:39:29.423]  Just like with Texas two years ago and that big freeze.
[00:39:29.723 --> 00:39:36.487]  They sent a letter six days before to the Fed saying, please let us turn up these coal plants that you've restricted and the gas plants.
[00:39:36.568 --> 00:39:39.149]  And the Fed said two days later, no.
[00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:43.692]  And then three days later, the big giant blizzard hit and the power went off.
[00:39:44.713 --> 00:39:47.655]  Because they wouldn't let us turn the power on!
[00:39:52.026 --> 00:39:53.047]  Same thing, folks.
[00:39:53.467 --> 00:39:54.969]  Same damn thing.
[00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:57.671]  And when I covered that, they said, Jones is a conspiracy theorist.
[00:39:58.252 --> 00:40:03.276]  The feds didn't order them not to turn on the power when it was a letter from the governor asking them to.
[00:40:04.677 --> 00:40:09.041]  It's on record how that works, but I'm a weirdo because I know the facts.
[00:40:11.283 --> 00:40:11.983]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:40:12.264 --> 00:40:13.185]  Listen, we need support.

[00:41:50.699 --> 00:41:56.020]  Hour number two, folks, when we go in to the future of what they're going to do and what it's going to look like.
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.220]  This is going to be horrible, but we got to get ahead of this.
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:03.979]   I don't even want to say these things on air, but I'm going to say it all next hour, so get ready.
[00:42:04.979 --> 00:42:10.980]  [Music]
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:14.980]  Just look at these headlines from Reuters.
[00:42:15.526 --> 00:42:18.169]  World faces unprecedented global hunger crisis.
[00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:20.572]  UN chief says going into 2023.
[00:42:21.533 --> 00:42:25.208]   World Food Program warns of global Food catastrophe.
[00:42:25.408 --> 00:42:26.649]  Looming global catastrophe.
[00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:30.113]  The world could run out of food by 2023, major studies say.
[00:42:30.533 --> 00:42:32.155]  And the reports go on and on.
[00:42:32.695 --> 00:42:35.858]  We told you this was a designed program by the globalists two and a half years ago.
[00:42:36.219 --> 00:42:40.263]  We told you energy and food prices would explode, and now they're up more than 40% in the U.S.
[00:42:40.303 --> 00:42:40.623]  alone.
[00:42:40.983 --> 00:42:42.205]  Some areas of the world are up over 100%.
[00:42:42.245 --> 00:42:52.271]   The only way you beat inflation and protect yourself and your family is with high-quality, affordable food ready to ship right now at at preparetoday.com at a very rare sale

[00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:19.431]   According to Pfizer's very limited human trials, 87% of pregnant mothers lost their babies
[00:43:19.431 --> 00:43:21.030]  after receiving the shot.
[00:43:21.354 --> 00:43:29.322]  And for those who survived the deadly shot and are able to reproduce, their offspring's DNA is now forever mutated.
[00:43:29.882 --> 00:43:35.067]  There is now irrefutable proof that the mRNA vaccines are a deadly toxin.
[00:43:35.567 --> 00:43:43.874]  Aside from the relentless debilitating spike protein that's keeping everyone who has been jabbed sick, the vaccines contain metals.
[00:43:44.475 --> 00:43:48.819]  Metals that have been observed to self-assemble outside of the body.
[00:43:49.179 --> 00:43:53.343]  And most disturbingly, metals that assemble inside of the body.
[00:43:53.863 --> 00:44:01.088]  Studies show that these metals are found in the blood of 94% of those who have received a COVID vaccine.
[00:44:01.969 --> 00:44:07.712]  And these mysterious conglomerates of metal make their final appearance in the dead.
[00:44:08.253 --> 00:44:16.358]  All over the world, coroners are now finding that the arteries of the vaccinated have been clogged with mysterious growths.
[00:44:17.059 --> 00:44:23.403]  Non-organic masses made up of conductive metals such as aluminum, sodium, and tin.
[00:44:24.324 --> 00:44:28.667]  This is what's most likely causing all the organ failure and heart attacks.
[00:44:29.328 --> 00:44:31.330]  Heart attacks in our children.
[00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:39.477]  Two days ago, I flew out my first 10-year-old with a heart attack and I had to fight the doctor in the ER because he's like, 10-year-olds don't have heart attacks.
[00:44:39.957 --> 00:44:54.793]  And I argued back and forth for 30 minutes to force his hand to get an EKG to find out that he had almost a complete STEMI, which is ST-elevated myocardial infarction, for which you could see it lit up on the 12 lead EKG.
[00:44:54.813 --> 00:44:56.675]  And he's like, well, that's not possible.
[00:44:56.715 --> 00:44:58.918]  And I'm like, well, he was just vaccinated yesterday.
[00:44:58.938 --> 00:45:00.459]  It is very much possible.
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:07.423]  At any given time, people are getting a hold of me and the nurse advocates at American Frontline Nurses to help advocate.
[00:45:07.443 --> 00:45:09.785]  Because as you've seen, there's victim shaming.
[00:45:10.685 --> 00:45:12.406]  That, oh, it's anxiety.
[00:45:12.566 --> 00:45:13.427]  Oh, it's this.
[00:45:13.947 --> 00:45:24.274]   But in actuality, if they put down that it was a vaccine injury, The physician, the corporation, the hospital, the clinic, they actually won't get reimbursed, so it gets labeled as anxiety.
[00:45:24.854 --> 00:45:31.361]  According to the whistleblowers, the doctors are lying about the vaccine deaths to make a few thousand bucks.
[00:45:31.921 --> 00:45:38.769]  Is that why Trump has been pushing the deadly shots, killing our own children for a measly million dollars?
[00:45:39.449 --> 00:45:50.121]  Now that the truth about the deadly COVID vaccines is finally starting to break free, the mainstream media is shifting their narrative and blaming it all on President Trump.
[00:45:50.542 --> 00:45:58.591]  And they've already laid the groundwork back in 2016, when the herd was told to believe that Trump is literally Hitler.
[00:45:59.011 --> 00:46:01.433]  We should look at Adolf Hitler in 1929.
[00:46:01.833 --> 00:46:05.736]  He was a kind of a funny kind of character that said the things that people were thinking.
[00:46:06.717 --> 00:46:09.899]  Where Donald Trump takes it, I have absolutely no idea.
[00:46:10.359 --> 00:46:13.942]  But Donald Trump is a dangerous man with the things that he has been saying.
[00:46:14.042 --> 00:46:17.685]  You might argue that Trump is innocent, but he doesn't.
[00:46:18.145 --> 00:46:21.528]  He brags of all the lives he has saved.
[00:46:22.028 --> 00:46:25.230]  And the herd will believe what they are told to believe.
[00:46:25.551 --> 00:46:30.714]  It shows you how unpainful that vaccine shot is, so everybody go get your shot.
[00:46:31.075 --> 00:46:34.777]  It works incredibly well, 95%, maybe even more than that.
[00:46:34.817 --> 00:46:36.138]  It works incredibly well.
[00:46:36.459 --> 00:46:40.802]  It's a great vaccine, it's a safe vaccine, and it's something that works.
[00:46:41.002 --> 00:46:43.803]  I recommend you take it, but I also believe in your freedoms 100%.
[00:46:44.744 --> 00:46:52.367]  When you have the vaccine, people that do, and it's a very small number, relatively, but people that do get it get better much quicker.
[00:46:52.667 --> 00:46:54.068]  That's a very important thing to know.
[00:46:54.708 --> 00:46:57.609]  They don't get nearly as sick and they get it, they get better.
[00:46:57.629 --> 00:46:58.910]  Lindsey Graham's an example.
[00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:01.151]  He said, if I didn't have this vaccine, I would have died.
[00:47:01.391 --> 00:47:02.032]  And you know what?
[00:47:02.132 --> 00:47:03.694]  I believe totally in your freedoms.
[00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:04.014]  I do.
[00:47:04.435 --> 00:47:05.556]  You gotta do what you have to do.
[00:47:05.636 --> 00:47:05.917]  But!
[00:47:06.778 --> 00:47:08.600]  I recommend taking the vaccines!
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:09.681]  I did it, it's good.
[00:47:09.761 --> 00:47:10.622]  Take the vaccines.
[00:47:10.702 --> 00:47:13.025]  But... You got... No, that's okay.
[00:47:13.065 --> 00:47:13.826]  That's alright.
[00:47:14.607 --> 00:47:15.588]  You got your freedoms.
[00:47:16.795 --> 00:47:18.675]  But I happen to take the vaccine.
[00:47:18.695 --> 00:47:20.736]  The vaccines do work and they are effective.
[00:47:21.636 --> 00:47:28.178]  I am, uh, I think I saved many, I don't think, I know I saved millions and millions of lives throughout the world.
[00:47:28.238 --> 00:47:30.058]  We could have had another Spanish flu.
[00:47:30.538 --> 00:47:34.920]  We could have had, you know, in 1917, close to 100 million people died, they say.
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:36.420]  But it was really bad.
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:43.042]  And now other countries are using our vaccines and, you know, they're tremendously successful.
[00:47:43.082 --> 00:47:46.704]  You're playing right into their hands when you sort of like, oh, the vaccine.
[00:47:47.144 --> 00:47:49.525]  If you don't want to take it, you shouldn't be forced to take it.
[00:47:49.965 --> 00:47:50.645]  No mandates.
[00:47:50.945 --> 00:47:55.367]  But take credit, because we saved tens of millions of lives.
[00:47:55.427 --> 00:47:55.907]  Take credit.
[00:47:56.187 --> 00:47:57.988]  Don't let them take that away from you.
[00:47:58.248 --> 00:48:00.609]  Okay, so the president made news... Do you agree with that?
[00:48:00.629 --> 00:48:01.589]  Right?
[00:48:05.538 --> 00:48:07.480]  Both the president and I are vaxxed.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.420]  Did you get the booster?
[00:48:09.501 --> 00:48:09.782]  Yes.
[00:48:10.042 --> 00:48:11.363]  I got it too.
[00:48:11.383 --> 00:48:24.253]  Using environmental regulations to take over the planet was the plan developed by NATO, by the Rockefeller Foundation, and by the Club of Rome in the early 1960s.
[00:48:26.015 --> 00:48:28.497]  By the late 1960s, they began to deploy the program.
[00:48:29.941 --> 00:48:32.003]  At first, a lot of reasonable sounding things.
[00:48:32.083 --> 00:48:34.085]  Let's put catalytic converters on cars.
[00:48:34.165 --> 00:48:42.132]  Let's have scrubbers on power plants so that they don't put out toxic gas or mercury vapor into the air.
[00:48:44.394 --> 00:48:45.955]  And then it was, oh, let's recycle.
[00:48:47.196 --> 00:48:48.698]  And hey, let's get rid of plastic straws.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.961]  And now let's get rid of gasoline cars altogether.
[00:48:53.001 --> 00:48:55.223]  And hey, let's get rid of farms and cows.
[00:48:55.283 --> 00:49:09.796]   And hey, We need to put all this expensive equipment, even on aqua-fed local water districts, to add a bunch of chemicals to it, and... Hey, let's not allow any oil drilling, or gas drilling, and cut-off pipelines, and then deploy...
[00:49:11.047 --> 00:49:14.248]  Energy systems that don't produce enough energy by design.
[00:49:14.488 --> 00:49:17.889]  And when you read what the big corporations say, they say, we don't want prosperity.
[00:49:18.129 --> 00:49:18.930]  We don't want growth.
[00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:24.291]  We want a post-industrial world, a post-human world, where there isn't a place for humans.
[00:49:24.531 --> 00:49:26.412]  That's the WEF officially.
[00:49:26.712 --> 00:49:28.993]  I can play you dozens of them saying it.
[00:49:29.033 --> 00:49:30.053]  We do it all the time.
[00:49:33.234 --> 00:49:42.242]   And so we're going out of Agenda 21, that was a world treaty in 1992, Rio de Janeiro, That we didn't sign on to, but George Herbert Walker Bush implemented.
[00:49:44.543 --> 00:49:45.964]  Now we're going into agenda 2030.
[00:49:47.085 --> 00:49:49.947]  And they are lockstep in this program to carry this out.
[00:49:49.987 --> 00:49:56.492]  And at the end of it, they say global warming would have killed billions of people.
[00:49:57.053 --> 00:50:02.477]  That viruses are going to come out of the jungles and you won't have a car or money anymore because of global warming.
[00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:06.272]  There'll be cataclysms and mass die-offs because of global warming.
[00:50:06.533 --> 00:50:08.274]  The sea levels will rise because of global warming.
[00:50:08.674 --> 00:50:18.403]  And all they're doing is giving you an Armageddon, end-of-the-world scenario so you accept that it's your fault it's happening and that the people that told you it was coming are the good guys.
[00:50:19.784 --> 00:50:33.355]   That's why in the last five years we've seen everybody from Biden to AOC to Obama to Beto O'Rourke to Klaus Schwab Telling you that by the year 2030, we'll have a totally collapsed world economy.
[00:50:33.676 --> 00:50:36.136]  But don't worry, they're gonna save you from it.
[00:50:37.777 --> 00:50:41.998]  While they go right down the line.
[00:50:44.059 --> 00:50:47.000]  And cut off every infrastructure we've got.
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.261]  Particularly sustainable, clean ones.
[00:50:51.821 --> 00:50:54.902]  And then they sell the most dystopian hell you could imagine.
[00:50:55.683 --> 00:50:56.483]  Eating bugs.
[00:50:57.358 --> 00:51:04.384]  Breaking sewage water, men and women's sports just to get you ready for stuff a hundred times more crazy.
[00:51:06.225 --> 00:51:12.971]  And Pavlovianly via Stockholm Syndrome and mass psychosis, mass formation psychosis.
[00:51:15.205 --> 00:51:18.168]  To just, okay, things are getting bad, what do I do to end it?
[00:51:18.528 --> 00:51:19.649]  How do I get out of a lockdown?
[00:51:19.949 --> 00:51:21.030]  How do I get my job back?
[00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:22.031]  You just take this shot.
[00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:23.252]  You just work from home.
[00:51:23.532 --> 00:51:24.513]  You just get rid of that car.
[00:51:24.874 --> 00:51:31.860]  And if you approve of this, and you go along, we'll give you a universal basic income, and you can sit around and play video games all day.
[00:51:33.481 --> 00:51:39.026]  Well, the truth is, you're not going to sit around and play video games all day once you've been isolated and living in some pod.
[00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:47.495]  Now they can slowly poison the water, slowly poison the food, inject you with GMOs, and normalize your death.
[00:51:47.855 --> 00:51:54.420]  So when we talk about them getting to their goal by 2030, which is not my goal, not my prediction, their plan.
[00:51:56.661 --> 00:51:58.042]  How are they going to get there in eight years?
[00:51:58.082 --> 00:51:58.803]  They're a little behind.
[00:52:00.404 --> 00:52:01.825]  Well, they tell us how they're going to get there.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:20.585]  Bertrand Russell in the 40s said, a global government through diet, injections, and injunctions, through law, and through poisoning your diet, and giving you injections that control you, will prepare you for depopulation.
[00:52:21.286 --> 00:52:33.742]   And that you can brainwash the public to accept it as long as it's done incrementally through different programs that all come together Building the larger structure.
[00:52:33.782 --> 00:52:34.543]  Think of Legos.
[00:52:35.124 --> 00:52:36.605]  Look at one piece and another piece.
[00:52:36.905 --> 00:52:38.647]  A hundred pieces of Legos laying out in front of you.
[00:52:38.867 --> 00:52:40.008]  You say, that's just a bunch of Legos.
[00:52:41.069 --> 00:52:47.234]  But if you've got the map and the instructions, you can build what they're building.
[00:52:48.015 --> 00:52:50.657]  And what they're building is a post-human world.
[00:52:51.258 --> 00:52:52.259]  So here we are.
[00:52:52.719 --> 00:52:54.841]  The kickoff of Agenda 2030, the year 2020.
[00:52:56.462 --> 00:52:59.145]  And like somebody blew a whistle or somebody fired a starter gun.
[00:53:00.211 --> 00:53:06.672]  Or the lights went from red to green and they waved the flag to race at the ND500.
[00:53:10.713 --> 00:53:11.314]  The race is on.
[00:53:11.334 --> 00:53:14.194]  And we're no longer in beta.
[00:53:15.214 --> 00:53:15.995]  Budget of 21.
[00:53:18.395 --> 00:53:20.536]  You are now in Operation New World Order.
[00:53:20.656 --> 00:53:22.456]  You are now in Operation Global Takeover.
[00:53:22.476 --> 00:53:24.216]  You are in Operation Forced Evolution.
[00:53:25.197 --> 00:53:26.697]  You're now in Operation Post-Human.
[00:53:28.792 --> 00:53:29.993]  And so, think about the numbers.
[00:53:30.053 --> 00:53:31.813]  I had Dr. Peter McCullough in studio.
[00:53:32.113 --> 00:53:33.194]  He tried to fly in Friday.
[00:53:33.294 --> 00:53:33.914]  Big storms.
[00:53:34.575 --> 00:53:35.895]  Flight was cancelled where he was at.
[00:53:37.936 --> 00:53:39.016]  He flew in Saturday morning.
[00:53:39.116 --> 00:53:42.458]  We did an hour-plus powerful interview that's at Man.Video.
[00:53:43.118 --> 00:53:46.560]  It's got 760,000 views and it's 760 million views.
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:55.484]  And I had the statistics and numbers and I said, here is the British Medical Journal admitting 9 out of 10 dying of COVID in the UK are triple jab.
[00:53:55.504 --> 00:53:56.364]  He said, yep, correct.
[00:53:57.546 --> 00:54:02.089]  Here is the Canadian government admitting 9 out of 10 dying of COVID are triple jabbed.
[00:54:02.249 --> 00:54:02.569]  Correct.
[00:54:03.449 --> 00:54:05.070]  That's just some of what's in this broadcast.
[00:54:05.631 --> 00:54:09.553]  Where he now says, it's official, it's meant to kill you, by design, it's a total takeover.
[00:54:10.253 --> 00:54:13.955]  Now he knew this privately a year ago, and we were saying, he said, I'm not going to go that far yet.
[00:54:13.975 --> 00:54:15.696]  We've got to wait till the evidence comes out.
[00:54:16.057 --> 00:54:21.020]  But he says, there'll be so much death soon, and we'll have the statistics that are a year behind, and I'll be ready to say it.
[00:54:22.801 --> 00:54:23.281]  He came here.
[00:54:26.024 --> 00:54:27.245]  And he said it's premeditated.
[00:54:27.285 --> 00:54:32.347]  He's a former top research scientist, now he does this full-time, and cardiologist.
[00:54:33.107 --> 00:54:37.630]  He's run major FDA studies on drug approvals with thousands of people.
[00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:47.274]  And he says he was one of the top people in the Baylor Medical System program that my dad was also a professor in.
[00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:54.131]  He says, without a doubt, this is being run as a depopulation program.
[00:54:54.391 --> 00:55:01.854]  Now, we don't need him to concur with us, but he's an establishment guy, and he's publicly saying that now on air, because that's where it is.
[00:55:02.094 --> 00:55:15.159]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've already injected, they estimate, two and a half billion people, mainly the Western world, their target, because we're the consumers, and we're also what the world aspires to be.
[00:55:15.479 --> 00:55:18.320]  You've got to create a dystopia for us, for you.
[00:55:19.966 --> 00:55:38.776]  And so they have deployed this that is a soft kill weapon that accelerates cancer, accelerates aging, accelerates DNA cutting of the double helix or the spike protein that causes mutations and that causes massive blood clots, artificial blood clots, heart attacks, strokes, you name it.
[00:55:39.677 --> 00:55:40.577]  And the numbers are out.
[00:55:40.697 --> 00:55:42.698]  It is just devastatingly horrible.
[00:55:44.319 --> 00:55:45.920]  So you say, how are we going to get there?
[00:55:47.031 --> 00:55:51.715]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's a side effect of how powerful these shots are.
[00:55:52.556 --> 00:55:55.298]  All four of them do the same thing, whether they're virus vector or mRNA.
[00:55:56.199 --> 00:56:01.264]  All designed, all pre-programmed by the Gates Group and then given to these manufacturers to deploy it.
[00:56:01.464 --> 00:56:04.447]  It's how they can say, oh, we figured out how to make this in two days!
[00:56:05.668 --> 00:56:06.468]  My ass, they did.
[00:56:06.508 --> 00:56:08.270]  They now admit they were preparing it for a decade.
[00:56:09.671 --> 00:56:11.433]  The side effect is killing you quickly.
[00:56:13.393 --> 00:56:19.497]  Because what it's going to do to people is so deadly that a minority of people die within three days.
[00:56:19.818 --> 00:56:21.159]  And Dr. McCullough put that out.
[00:56:24.801 --> 00:56:29.124]  Close to 1% of people die within days.
[00:56:30.686 --> 00:56:32.087]  More start dying in a few months.
[00:56:33.187 --> 00:56:35.229]  But can you imagine what the real effect of this is?
[00:56:40.046 --> 00:56:40.927]  This is so sick.
[00:56:41.627 --> 00:57:02.099]  They're a bunch of rich people that are running Ponzi schemes, that have bought up the world through fraud, and they've hired a bunch of bureaucrats and PR people to sell you on this idea they're trying to save you when they're openly killing you, and this COVID rollout was just a beta test of more deadly viruses and more deadly vaccines to see what they can get away with while they're killing you.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:04.700]  And I got a stack of news on that.
[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:10.928]   We'll get to, but They're taking over the food supply.
[00:57:11.169 --> 00:57:12.390]  They're taking over the water supply.
[00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:13.571]  They're dissolving the borders.
[00:57:14.412 --> 00:57:18.417]  They're making the universities give secondary education.
[00:57:19.463 --> 00:57:24.704]  And primary education give you worthless degrees, where you just know how to feel sorry for yourself, and you know your pronouns.
[00:57:25.164 --> 00:57:28.025]  They are hitting every level of the infrastructure.
[00:57:28.045 --> 00:57:28.825]  They're hitting savings.
[00:57:28.845 --> 00:57:29.945]  They're hitting small businesses.
[00:57:30.445 --> 00:57:46.208]  They are rolling out a civilization-ending system, where they, through bureaucracy, implode everybody else, and consolidate you under their control, so then, with a universal basic income, they can dictate every facet of your life, and get giant armies of lemmings signed on to follow any order they want.
[00:57:46.228 --> 00:57:47.368]  We'll explain that when we come back.
[00:57:49.271 --> 00:57:50.592]  ...had on big media and so on.
[00:57:50.932 --> 00:57:51.692]  I had no idea.
[00:57:52.173 --> 00:57:57.435]  It is clear that the pharmaceutical industry has a great deal of sway on what goes on.
[00:57:57.815 --> 00:58:01.217]  If you can shape the message, then you can shape the world.
[00:58:01.577 --> 00:58:02.418]  And that's what they've done.
[00:58:03.418 --> 00:58:08.881]  When was the last time you turned on the news and ever got an update about how the rest of the world is handling COVID?
[00:58:09.685 --> 00:58:13.647]  A group of South African doctors has launched an urgent court application.
[00:58:13.988 --> 00:58:16.809]  They are seeking easier access to Ivermectin.
[00:58:16.869 --> 00:58:22.853]  Globally, at least five countries want to use Ivermectin to treat COVID-19, including India and Argentina.
[00:58:22.873 --> 00:58:29.277]  There are numerous concrete tests in medical journals around the world that Ivermectin does work.
[00:58:29.597 --> 00:58:39.680]  The earliest reports we had, one of them we had in Peru, where they got into a good mode of using multi-drug treatment with an ivermectin-based approach, that they were crushing their curves.
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:46.602]  And the president of the Tokyo Medical Association announced to all doctors during a summer surge that they should use ivermectin in their treatment.
[00:58:47.402 --> 00:58:55.364]  Within weeks, the hospitalization rates reported out of Japan were lower than at any other time in the pandemic.
[00:58:56.104 --> 00:59:00.872]  The real proof positive came when COVID-19 really hit hard in Mexico City.
[00:59:02.094 --> 00:59:08.123]  They finally, after lots of struggle, came up with an ivermectin-based multi-drug approach and literally cleared out the hospitals.
[00:59:09.443 --> 00:59:12.405]  And then we had reports all the way through that various states in India.
[00:59:12.746 --> 00:59:16.549]  In India, the government has been widely promoting the use of ivermectin.
[00:59:16.809 --> 00:59:22.814]  State leaders have just declared that Uttar Pradesh is now officially COVID-free.
[00:59:23.354 --> 00:59:29.957]   A region with nearly as many people as the entire United States is totally COVID free.
[00:59:29.957 --> 00:59:35.597]   The miracle success of Uttar Pradesh, not one mention of ivermectin being used.
[00:59:35.597 --> 00:59:38.757]   In the countries that it has been used, in the countries where the studies are,
[00:59:38.757 --> 00:59:40.997]  the results are not good, they are overwhelming.
[00:59:40.997 --> 00:59:43.197]  They are well over 90% success rate.
[00:59:43.197 --> 00:59:48.796]   In the United States, it's a horse dewormer, it's horse-paced, and only the illiterate, ignorant,
[00:59:48.796 --> 00:59:51.237]  and/or unvaccinated use it.
[00:59:51.237 --> 00:59:56.517]   The key paradox is if you look at the mortality rate in the United States,
[00:59:56.517 --> 01:00:00.437]   one of the most highly funded medical care systems in the world,
[01:00:00.437 --> 01:00:04.517]   and what we find is the mortality in the United States is among the worst.
[01:00:04.517 --> 01:00:14.517]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:00:06.923 --> 01:00:09.124]  Show the end of that graph again without audio.
[01:00:09.204 --> 01:00:11.545]  Show that to the viewers, the radio listeners.
[01:00:12.325 --> 01:00:14.206]  The United States isn't amongst the worst.
[01:00:14.386 --> 01:00:18.127]  It's the worst because we're targeted for annihilation.
[01:00:19.388 --> 01:00:23.148]  We're being hit with a chem-bio weapon of nanotech.
[01:00:23.148 --> 01:00:32.108]  We're being annihilated.
[01:00:32.313 --> 01:00:33.133]  We're being destroyed.
[01:00:34.318 --> 01:00:40.023]  And the numbers don't lie from the insurance companies, and the morticians, and the cemeteries, I'll tell you.
[01:00:40.743 --> 01:00:45.147]  2021, now 2022, record deaths compared to any time even World War II.
[01:00:46.708 --> 01:00:51.532]  We're losing more people a year from these shots than died in Vietnam in a decade.
[01:00:51.352 --> 01:00:59.031]  1968, 1964, 1974.
[01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:00.031]  These numbers don't lie.
[01:01:00.798 --> 01:01:07.143]  And they just want to normalize it as a background noise that everybody listening knows somebody died after they took a shot.
[01:01:08.444 --> 01:01:12.247]  And that's somebody that had a bad effect to it with what its real design is.
[01:01:13.067 --> 01:01:17.731]  Long-term causing cancer and sterility on record.
[01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:21.074]  So they're not going to start killing us en masse.
[01:01:21.254 --> 01:01:22.055]  They've done it.
[01:01:23.137 --> 01:01:32.264]  So people ask me, Jones, how do you take being attacked by hundreds of publications and dozens of national TV programs a day, sometimes thousands?
[01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:35.447]  Well, I expect this.
[01:01:37.148 --> 01:01:40.591]  I know they could kill me anytime, set me up, indict me, put me in prison.
[01:01:40.871 --> 01:01:44.894]  I don't want that to happen, but I can't be part of what they're doing.
[01:01:45.854 --> 01:01:48.896]  And that means total commitment and total resistance to them.
[01:01:49.176 --> 01:01:50.617]  That's why we built this operation.
[01:01:51.137 --> 01:01:53.619]  That's why you built this operation, with your support.
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.081]  So understand, that's why we're the front line.
[01:01:57.121 --> 01:01:57.801]  You're the front line.
[01:01:58.862 --> 01:02:18.260]   And now, I tell you again with the good news, with all this bad news I've been telling you, all over Eastern Europe, all over Africa, all over Latin America, all over Asia, InfoWars is watched by government leaders and intelligence chiefs and law enforcement heads.
[01:02:19.801 --> 01:02:24.404]  But I could list a lot on record that have reached out, including in person, but I'm not even going to get into all that.
[01:02:26.526 --> 01:02:33.870]  Because that's not us bragging to you, that's us telling you the good news of what you've done supporting this transmission.
[01:02:35.592 --> 01:02:36.272]  We are the leader.
[01:02:37.673 --> 01:02:39.114]  We're the tip of the spear.
[01:02:40.413 --> 01:02:47.396]  Because we're willing to face how premeditated this is from the enemy's own words and show you every facet of it.
[01:02:50.237 --> 01:02:52.218]  Now, I started over an hour ago on this.
[01:02:52.358 --> 01:02:54.880]  I'm going to finish up where I started in this segment.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:59.262]  I'm going to come back with the current and what's going into the future.
[01:02:59.962 --> 01:03:02.123]  But it's very simple to understand the basics.
[01:03:02.163 --> 01:03:04.644]  And I know you know this, but you got to get it to other people.
[01:03:05.143 --> 01:03:13.907]  And all you geniuses out there that take three, four hour shows and condense them down to two and a half minute, three minute, five minute reports, you're really good at condensing what I do.
[01:03:14.647 --> 01:03:18.109]  You are our interface and you are really the victory.
[01:03:19.729 --> 01:03:53.585]   So take everything we say, watch it with your incredible mind, decide what's the best way to condense it, add b-roll, documents, whatever you want, and keep getting it out on Rumble and Getter, which are feeders and All the other great patriot sites, and use the power you have to know that those sites then feed it, whether it's Bitchute or whether it's Gab, you name it, onto the enemy platforms and they can't stop you.
[01:03:54.741 --> 01:03:57.443]  We are kicking their evil ass.
[01:03:58.144 --> 01:04:02.788]  Klaus Schwab, the New World Order, I could spend all day, the Info Wars must be stopped.
[01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:07.392]  We are hiring 150,000 Info Warriors to counter him.
[01:04:07.792 --> 01:04:09.033]  He is state-sponsored.
[01:04:09.254 --> 01:04:10.475]  Yeah, by God.
[01:04:11.436 --> 01:04:12.016]  By the people.
[01:04:12.436 --> 01:04:13.297]  You're state-sponsored.
[01:04:13.577 --> 01:04:14.518]  You're corporate-sponsored.
[01:04:14.859 --> 01:04:15.899]  You're New World Order-sponsored.
[01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:18.562]  They know we're the people.
[01:04:18.962 --> 01:04:20.323]  They know we stand for justice.
[01:04:20.403 --> 01:04:20.764]  They know.
[01:04:24.286 --> 01:04:26.447]  So, it's very simple, I'm going to say it again.
[01:04:27.728 --> 01:04:55.783]   Artificially cut off the economy, implode the nation state, ship in drugs, name the country, destroy confidence, break the people's will, and then come in and say, we've got a universal basic income for you, as long as you agree to live the way we say live, as long as you spend the money where we say, which is programmed on the digital tokens, on your iPhone, on your Droid, on your chip, on your card, We will let you live.
[01:04:56.284 --> 01:04:57.344]  But of course that's a trap.
[01:04:57.364 --> 01:05:00.826]  They're not domesticating you because they want to just keep you around.
[01:05:01.006 --> 01:05:12.331]  They're getting you totally under their control and isolated so you will politically and culturally submit to them for the next incremental horror and the next successful approximation as it gets worse and worse and worse.
[01:05:12.632 --> 01:05:31.300]   And then people that have been involved in the fraud, people that have been scammed, they won't want to admit To themselves that they've been set up, and so they statistically, under this mass formation, under this psychosis, under this Stockholm Syndrome, they believe, the globalists believe, that you will just give up and roll over.
[01:05:34.522 --> 01:05:38.585]  The big thing they're already promoting is, oh, on your credit, you'll get a year.
[01:05:38.785 --> 01:05:39.726]  At first it'll be five years.
[01:05:41.126 --> 01:05:41.807]  Then it'll be a year.
[01:05:42.187 --> 01:05:43.068]  Then it'll be six weeks.
[01:05:43.088 --> 01:05:43.788]  Then it'll be a month.
[01:05:43.828 --> 01:05:44.709]  Then it'll be two days.
[01:05:47.185 --> 01:05:53.229]  You'll get all this money put on your credit to go out and do whatever you want, but you gotta get euthanized at the end of it.
[01:05:54.630 --> 01:06:05.839]  They're gonna take you down to a center, have super nice people tell you how great you are, lead you in, lay you down on a gurney, let you watch a beautiful scene of whatever you want, they're gonna put you on a bunch of narcotics, you already signed the paper, and they're gonna kill you.
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:07.560]  That's the plan.
[01:06:09.421 --> 01:06:12.283]  Soylent Green is pre-programming for their admitted program.
[01:06:12.123 --> 01:06:14.123]  Canada's already doing it right now.
[01:06:14.123 --> 01:06:23.413]   It is becoming increasingly clear that looking forward with the COVID-19 pandemic in the absence of a dramatically
[01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:28.329]   different different variant, we likely are moving towards a path with
[01:06:28.329 --> 01:06:34.479]   a vaccination cadence similar to that of the annual influenza vaccine with annual
[01:06:34.479 --> 01:06:40.159]   updated COVID-19 shots matched to the currently circulating strains for most
[01:06:40.159 --> 01:06:44.449]   of the population. I really believe this is why God gave us two
[01:06:44.449 --> 01:06:49.609]   arms, one for the flu shot and the other one for the COVID shot.
[01:06:50.409 --> 01:06:52.409]  All right.
[01:06:52.409 --> 01:07:02.408]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:06:53.878 --> 01:06:56.819]  I'm gonna do a massive news blitz and tie it all together right now.
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:03.682]  I'm gonna go back where we started last hour with this global social credit score in Europe and the UK being announced.
[01:07:04.423 --> 01:07:11.266]  Trillions of dollars doled out by the government to be paid selectively to where they want the money spent.
[01:07:12.606 --> 01:07:18.489]  Incoming Prime Minister in the UK drafts colossal 130 billion plan to freeze UK power bills.
[01:07:20.327 --> 01:07:28.734]  Putin has pushed Europe into an inflationary depression and currency collapse, but it was the sanctions on Russia not letting the fuel in that did it.
[01:07:29.695 --> 01:07:36.540]  Italy's Salvini breaks ranks in energy sanctions against Russia because we are on our knees.
[01:07:38.842 --> 01:07:43.646]  Russia drops the hammer, halts gas flows to Europe through main pipeline until sanctions lifted.
[01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:44.467]  They didn't do it.
[01:07:44.767 --> 01:07:46.068]  They had sanctions put on them first.
[01:07:48.087 --> 01:07:56.813]  As Europe implodes, it plans radical intervention, close quote, including price settings, suspending derivatives markets, and Europe-wide margin calls.
[01:07:58.515 --> 01:08:00.136]  And a social credit score, of course.
[01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:05.059]  With it, WEF Young Global Leader warns, up to 10 difficult winters coming.
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:09.683]  And once you're used to having your power shut off for 10 years, well, it'll just be permanent.
[01:08:10.603 --> 01:08:11.064]  Economists.
[01:08:11.104 --> 01:08:13.385]  Europeans are mad with anger and it will worsen.
[01:08:13.445 --> 01:08:14.366]  That's the angrier world.
[01:08:14.686 --> 01:08:15.507]  Klaus Schwab thinks.
[01:08:15.527 --> 01:08:16.848]  He thinks you'll see him as a savior.
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:18.860]  And it goes on.
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:19.841]  Infowars.com.
[01:08:19.881 --> 01:08:21.081]  A strange time in the UK.
[01:08:22.662 --> 01:08:26.904]  Trillions in liquidity support is going to be needed as the Swiss and the Finns join the EU.
[01:08:28.205 --> 01:08:31.846]  Long for a European-wide Marshall Plan to deal with energy prices.
[01:08:34.748 --> 01:08:36.188]  But that's okay, they're ripping everybody off.
[01:08:36.389 --> 01:08:40.651]  Times newspaper highlights how no white men will hold major office in new UK government.
[01:08:41.671 --> 01:08:43.392]  But it's old rich white men running the takeover.
[01:08:44.451 --> 01:08:49.515]  Winners have energy bills paid on dystopian UK morning game show.
[01:08:51.656 --> 01:08:55.919]  Biden says computer chip shortage biggest reason for inflation and wacky speech.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.462]  Netherlands shuts down majority of farms for the environment.
[01:09:01.463 --> 01:09:04.625]  Economists, Europeans are mad with anger and it will only worsen.
[01:09:06.727 --> 01:09:09.088]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:09:09.427 --> 01:09:17.507]   And you got Biden forgiving the so-called student debt, which again, gets you ready for the social credit score
[01:09:17.507 --> 01:09:20.927]   'cause you're part of a group they like, which will further inflation.
[01:09:20.927 --> 01:09:32.547]   And that ties into this article, CNN employees freaked out over recent exits under new boss.
[01:09:33.214 --> 01:09:34.255]  Is there a purge going on?
[01:09:34.315 --> 01:09:34.535]  Yeah.
[01:09:35.116 --> 01:09:36.838]  You destroyed yourself in the political process.
[01:09:36.898 --> 01:09:37.738]  Now you're useless.
[01:09:38.219 --> 01:09:39.200]  Now they throw you to the side.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.122]  Stop selling yourself out.
[01:09:41.422 --> 01:09:45.426]  Stop selling out other people thinking you won't then be destroyed.
[01:09:46.687 --> 01:09:51.972]  That's why the globalists are gonna have to hide from the collapse they've engineered at their armored redoubts around the world.
[01:09:52.553 --> 01:09:55.656]  Super rich preppers seek to save themselves from apocalypse.
[01:09:56.926 --> 01:10:01.392]  For them, the future of technology is about one thing, escape from the rest of us.
[01:10:04.176 --> 01:10:06.760]  And it goes on and on and on from there.
[01:10:07.381 --> 01:10:09.664]  Now let's move into what we just played clips of.
[01:10:10.365 --> 01:10:20.082]   Fauci says Annually updated COVID shots, whatever the new thing is they create, are likely required to match the currently circulating strains.
[01:10:20.182 --> 01:10:21.683]  Oh, but the shots would protect you.
[01:10:21.923 --> 01:10:22.544]  But they don't.
[01:10:22.924 --> 01:10:26.146]  Once they get you in the trap of Stockholm Syndrome, it just gets worse.
[01:10:26.906 --> 01:10:37.092]  Biden administration advisor Ashish Jha believes God gave us two arms, one for the flu shot and one for the other one, the COVID shot.
[01:10:39.053 --> 01:10:40.134]  Medical censorship.
[01:10:40.194 --> 01:10:53.507]  California Democrats approved bill to punish doctors who spread COVID misinfo, like saying Ivermectin works or the shots don't work, which is all true, but we'll just take your medical license.
[01:10:54.187 --> 01:10:56.329]  Major British Medical Journal standard.
[01:10:57.811 --> 01:10:59.672]  Ivermectin cuts COVID mortality by 92%.
[01:11:01.014 --> 01:11:02.235]  Major study finds.
[01:11:02.695 --> 01:11:04.217]  Why is it still not approved?
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:09.281]  Zero COVID in China, lockdowns of major cities continue.
[01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:15.722]  Guys, cue up the clip, the latest dystopian clip, not a science fiction horror movie, but reality.
[01:11:15.762 --> 01:11:23.284]  We'll play it with audio, of a drone flying between apartment buildings that have been locked down for a month with no COVID, saying you cannot leave your house.
[01:11:23.864 --> 01:11:26.165]  This is the robot dystopia.
[01:11:25.985 --> 01:11:49.225]  Go ahead and play it.
[01:11:49.225 --> 01:11:51.585]  What a wonderful liberal new world order they're building.
[01:11:51.529 --> 01:11:52.189]  It's so fun.
[01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:53.289]  Let's all get behind it.
[01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:56.730]  This is all on record.
[01:11:57.663 --> 01:12:00.285]  Exempt from the COVID-19 injection mandate.
[01:12:00.685 --> 01:12:01.226]  Congress.
[01:12:02.146 --> 01:12:03.067]  The legislative branch.
[01:12:03.647 --> 01:12:04.608]  Congressional staff.
[01:12:04.708 --> 01:12:05.529]  Judicial branch.
[01:12:05.609 --> 01:12:06.689]  Federal courts and judges.
[01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:07.910]  White House staff.
[01:12:08.371 --> 01:12:09.411]  CDC employees.
[01:12:09.832 --> 01:12:10.652]  FDA employees.
[01:12:11.032 --> 01:12:11.253]  U.S.
[01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:12.413]  Postal Office employees.
[01:12:12.714 --> 01:12:16.316]  Dr. Fauci's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases employees.
[01:12:16.336 --> 01:12:17.537]  Pfizer employees.
[01:12:17.797 --> 01:12:18.798]  Moderna employees.
[01:12:19.098 --> 01:12:19.859]  Illegal immigrants.
[01:12:20.119 --> 01:12:21.540]  The list goes on and on.
[01:12:24.462 --> 01:12:26.103]  Isn't that cute?
[01:12:28.689 --> 01:12:30.610]  And since I talked about it, let me show you this.
[01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.390]  Study.
[01:12:32.289 --> 01:12:36.969]  Ivermectin reduces COVID death risk by 92%.
[01:12:36.969 --> 01:12:41.609]  But that's okay.
[01:12:41.609 --> 01:12:51.609]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:12:46.074 --> 01:12:49.635]  Doctor says 98% of 52 studies on Ivermectin show positive effects.
[01:12:49.675 --> 01:12:50.695]  But you can't have it.
[01:12:51.055 --> 01:12:52.476]  Because they're murdering you.
[01:12:53.156 --> 01:12:54.176]  They're killing you.
[01:12:54.656 --> 01:12:57.237]  They think the whole thing is funny.
[01:13:00.150 --> 01:13:06.493]  You ask what's coming in the rest of the Great Reset, and I'll tell you what's coming.
[01:13:09.554 --> 01:13:10.374]  More of the same.
[01:13:12.235 --> 01:13:13.776]  The internet's freaking out right now.
[01:13:15.076 --> 01:13:17.097]  There's viral videos everywhere of this show.
[01:13:18.237 --> 01:13:20.878]  On Instagram, on Twitter, on TikTok, on everywhere.
[01:13:22.419 --> 01:13:23.419]  There's even articles about it.
[01:13:23.459 --> 01:13:25.020]  Man, you can't allow Alex Jones.
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.941]  I mean, these old clips are even worse than his new ones.
[01:13:28.786 --> 01:13:29.526]  That's how it works.
[01:13:30.067 --> 01:13:31.488]  I'll be the ghost of the machine forever.
[01:13:31.788 --> 01:13:33.189]  And so will all our listeners and viewers.
[01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:37.671]  Because the worse it gets, the more people remember what we said.
[01:13:38.071 --> 01:13:39.232]  That's the little secret.
[01:13:42.834 --> 01:13:46.516]  Power companies use the control of thermostats in Colorado during heat wave, remember?
[01:13:47.197 --> 01:13:48.337]  Told you that years ago was coming.
[01:13:50.739 --> 01:13:53.040]  And that ties into all these other reports.
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:56.222]  Wait till we get to the next report.
[01:13:57.819 --> 01:14:07.386]  The non-detainable offenses under the Safety Act, now law in Illinois, will allow murderers no jail time.
[01:14:07.987 --> 01:14:08.407]  The Purge.
[01:14:10.509 --> 01:14:14.772]  And that ties into, Mexicans are fed up with Americans moving their cities.
[01:14:15.333 --> 01:14:16.554]  That's next segment.
[01:14:18.175 --> 01:14:21.598]  The rest of the Great Reset and how they plan to bring us down straight ahead.
[01:14:23.179 --> 01:14:25.040]  Please remember, we're Loser Supported.
[01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:43.789]   And please remember, Today is the last day to get Vitamin Mineral Fusion, DNA Force Plus, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, and so much more, 50 to 40% off.
[01:14:43.829 --> 01:14:45.230]  These are incredible products.
[01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:50.991]  They fund the human resistance movement against tyranny, and they're amazing.
[01:14:53.971 --> 01:14:56.572]  Everybody should be on Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:14:56.572 --> 01:14:58.650]  Everybody should be on Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:14:58.650 --> 01:15:01.390]  They're the highest quality and they fund this operation.
[01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:06.211]  Today's the last day to get 40 to 50% off on those products.
[01:15:06.211 --> 01:15:10.451]   Ultimate Fish Oil, though, only came in two weeks ago, so we've got enough of that right now.
[01:15:10.451 --> 01:15:13.091]  It'll stay at 40% off for a couple more weeks.
[01:15:13.091 --> 01:15:17.731]   But DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula,
[01:15:17.731 --> 01:15:20.731]  for 50 and 40% off will end today.
[01:15:20.805 --> 01:15:25.547]  We have to, because it's already very low, and we're not going to get more of it for probably three, four months.
[01:15:25.887 --> 01:15:29.188]  So we're going to sell out of the rest of it at full price, which we need to fund ourselves.
[01:15:29.228 --> 01:15:32.210]  But for those of you that are big supporters, thank you for your support.
[01:15:32.610 --> 01:15:33.870]  Take advantage of these sales now.
[01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:39.233]  There's not a more important place to fund, InfoWarsTore.com, or Triple Eight.
[01:15:39.893 --> 01:15:40.614]  2-5-3, 3-1-3-9.
[01:15:41.354 --> 01:15:42.795]  All right.
[01:15:43.596 --> 01:15:45.197]  Big news blitz coming up.
[01:15:45.237 --> 01:15:47.019]  You'll get the rest of the story straight ahead.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:53.284]  Imagine a world where every device in your home is remote controlled by corporations and government.
[01:15:54.004 --> 01:15:55.285]  You're now living in that world.
[01:15:55.966 --> 01:15:57.247]  They launch the sneak attack.
[01:15:57.927 --> 01:15:59.769]  They plan the whole technocracy takeover.
[01:16:00.129 --> 01:16:07.595]  But if you're aware of the globalists and they're in game to literally starve and exterminate you and you warn others and we start resisting, it's game over.
[01:16:10.266 --> 01:16:14.729]  Ladies and gentlemen, the future is here and it's anti-human.
[01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:16.931]  Let's take control of the future again.
[01:16:16.951 --> 01:16:19.453]  It is our destiny!
[01:16:22.523 --> 01:16:25.065]  Hot one today with temperatures in the low 90s.
[01:16:25.245 --> 01:16:28.187]  Even Mike Nelson would tell you Tuesday was a hot one.
[01:16:28.567 --> 01:16:30.008]  The heat goes on.
[01:16:30.088 --> 01:16:33.270]  Which is why Tony Tallarico tried to crank up the AC.
[01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:37.172]  I mean it was 90 out and it was right during the peak period.
[01:16:37.412 --> 01:16:40.634]  That's when he found out he had no control of his thermostat.
[01:16:41.014 --> 01:16:46.398]  A message from Excel on his thermostat saying temperature locked during an energy emergency.
[01:16:46.578 --> 01:16:49.900]  And normally when we see a message like that we're able to override it.
[01:16:53.924 --> 01:16:54.784]  Backing up to the beginning.
[01:16:55.785 --> 01:17:05.835]  We can spend a year on this one video, and if you understand this one video that's like eight minutes long, we're not gonna play the whole thing, you would understand the whole New World Order.
[01:17:08.137 --> 01:17:12.842]  Because it's hot is why someone's remote-controlling his thermostat.
[01:17:13.823 --> 01:17:24.400]   No, They cut off the power plants, they cut off the energy, now they're rationing it and legitimizing this thing you put in your house that nobody told you was going to control your life.
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:26.501]  This is the rollout.
[01:17:26.701 --> 01:17:31.143]  Oh, we're doing forced lockdowns, we're doing forced injections because of this deadly virus that they created.
[01:17:31.163 --> 01:17:33.224]  It's the same thing.
[01:17:33.284 --> 01:17:35.505]  They cut off the power, they roll out the control.
[01:17:37.534 --> 01:17:38.254]  And it's an introduction.
[01:17:38.434 --> 01:17:39.234]  Oh my gosh!
[01:17:39.614 --> 01:17:40.635]  We're in an emergency.
[01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:42.075]  We're in a climate emergency.
[01:17:42.515 --> 01:17:43.875]  We're in a COVID emergency.
[01:17:44.155 --> 01:17:45.456]  We're in a border emergency.
[01:17:45.736 --> 01:17:47.696]  We're in a currency emergency.
[01:17:48.136 --> 01:17:50.877]  We're in an emergency of the culture because they're collapsing it.
[01:17:51.297 --> 01:17:53.778]  And each step you give in to only gets worse.
[01:17:53.798 --> 01:17:56.058]  That could take 10 seconds of each piece of this.
[01:17:56.558 --> 01:17:58.779]  Because they're giving these scripts by the big networks.
[01:17:58.819 --> 01:18:00.079]  This is local ABC in Denver.
[01:18:01.159 --> 01:18:02.740]  And all over the country this is rolled out.
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:04.680]  In your town next.
[01:18:06.345 --> 01:18:07.306]  It was the exact script.
[01:18:07.606 --> 01:18:07.726]  Oh!
[01:18:08.127 --> 01:18:09.608]  That's why my thermostat was controlled.
[01:18:09.648 --> 01:18:10.269]  It was too high.
[01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:12.311]  No discussion of why do they control it.
[01:18:12.531 --> 01:18:13.272]  Who planned this?
[01:18:13.812 --> 01:18:16.495]  We can go back 20 years ago, where I was warning you this was coming.
[01:18:18.577 --> 01:18:21.740]  But just like that, suddenly you're inside the New World Order.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:22.481]  Start it over.
[01:18:23.763 --> 01:18:25.984]  One today with temperatures in the low 90s.
[01:18:26.164 --> 01:18:29.105]  Even Mike Nelson would tell you Tuesday was a hot one.
[01:18:29.486 --> 01:18:30.926]  The heat goes on.
[01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:34.188]  Which is why Tony Tallarico tried to crank up the A.C.
[01:18:34.288 --> 01:18:38.109]  I mean it was 90 out and it was right during the peak period.
[01:18:38.329 --> 01:18:41.551]  That's when he found out he had no control of his thermostat.
[01:18:41.931 --> 01:18:47.273]  A message from Excel on his thermostat saying temperature locked during an energy emergency.
[01:18:47.373 --> 01:18:48.314]  Pause normally.
[01:18:48.334 --> 01:18:49.854]  I got a five seconds.
[01:18:51.695 --> 01:18:52.816]  This is gonna go for your cars.
[01:18:53.851 --> 01:18:55.011]  This is going to go for your power?
[01:18:55.031 --> 01:18:56.732]  It's going to go for your children?
[01:18:56.752 --> 01:18:58.212]  It's going to go for your devices?
[01:18:58.633 --> 01:19:00.073]  Oh, your device is turned off!
[01:19:02.494 --> 01:19:02.594]  Oh!
[01:19:02.954 --> 01:19:03.174]  See?
[01:19:03.774 --> 01:19:03.874]  Oh!
[01:19:04.315 --> 01:19:05.235]  It's a technocracy.
[01:19:05.295 --> 01:19:06.975]  They're in full control of the environment.
[01:19:07.235 --> 01:19:13.097]  They've created an artificial environment that we have now been opted into by not knowing what it was really going to do.
[01:19:13.157 --> 01:19:14.058]  But I was there telling you.
[01:19:15.378 --> 01:19:17.399]  Now you're going to listen to me about the next phase, right?
[01:19:18.945 --> 01:19:20.026]  Shutting down society.
[01:19:20.086 --> 01:19:21.086]  Fully collapsing things.
[01:19:21.126 --> 01:19:30.211]  Them saying, okay, accept the world ID card, accept go to work brigades, accept getting sterilized, accept do all these things, and then we'll let you have your phone on.
[01:19:31.272 --> 01:19:32.292]  We'll let your car work.
[01:19:32.332 --> 01:19:33.313]  We'll let you go to work.
[01:19:33.753 --> 01:19:34.613]  That's in the first part.
[01:19:36.514 --> 01:19:37.695]  This is a social credit score.
[01:19:38.816 --> 01:19:40.356]  It's not about not being a right winger.
[01:19:40.397 --> 01:19:41.677]  It's not about not being a racist.
[01:19:41.977 --> 01:19:44.058]  It's not about, no, it's about being a Christian.
[01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:45.459]  It's about having children.
[01:19:45.519 --> 01:19:46.740]  It's about social engineering.
[01:19:47.768 --> 01:19:51.133]  You've got all these jellyfish that don't know they're caught in a trap.
[01:19:52.695 --> 01:19:54.458]  This guy's got his leg stuck in a bear trap.
[01:19:54.819 --> 01:19:57.603]  He thinks he sticks his other foot in, he'll be okay into another bear trap.
[01:19:58.284 --> 01:20:01.989]  The answer is, recognize it, say no, and don't accept it!
[01:20:02.871 --> 01:20:03.271]  Continue.
[01:20:04.349 --> 01:20:07.571]  That's when he found out he had no control of his thermostat.
[01:20:07.931 --> 01:20:13.335]  A message from Excel on his thermostat saying temperature locked during an energy emergency.
[01:20:13.735 --> 01:20:16.857]  Normally, when we see a message like that, we're able to override it.
[01:20:17.878 --> 01:20:18.699]  In this case, we weren't.
[01:20:18.979 --> 01:20:20.280]  So our thermostat was locked in.
[01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:21.420]  Hit pause again.
[01:20:21.601 --> 01:20:22.681]  Back in the police department.
[01:20:24.042 --> 01:20:25.283]  Again, it's all pre-programmed.
[01:20:25.303 --> 01:20:26.244]  They have the message ready.
[01:20:26.464 --> 01:20:27.925]  They're ready for the emergency.
[01:20:29.943 --> 01:20:34.168]  Just like they wouldn't let Texas turn up its power generation during the freeze two years ago.
[01:20:34.188 --> 01:20:37.172]  And this guy's like, oh, this thing just popped up.
[01:20:37.472 --> 01:20:38.954]  Well, I guess it's an emergency.
[01:20:38.974 --> 01:20:40.856]  I don't control my thermostat now.
[01:20:41.056 --> 01:20:42.678]  Well, it's for the best.
[01:20:43.739 --> 01:20:46.783]  It'll get better if we all just work through it and do what they say.
[01:20:47.203 --> 01:20:47.644]  Continue.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.622]  That's when he found out he had no control of his thermostat.
[01:20:52.982 --> 01:20:58.366]  A message from Excel on his thermostat saying temperature locked during an energy emergency.
[01:20:58.786 --> 01:21:01.928]  Normally, when we see a message like that, we're able to override it.
[01:21:02.928 --> 01:21:03.749]  In this case, we weren't.
[01:21:04.029 --> 01:21:06.070]  So our thermostat was locked at 70.
[01:21:07.851 --> 01:21:11.193]  You could teach a master's degree in this, in mind control.
[01:21:11.874 --> 01:21:14.575]  Normally, when we see a message, they got you used to this.
[01:21:15.075 --> 01:21:17.457]  Oh, you see the messages, but you can override it.
[01:21:18.837 --> 01:21:22.560]  You can override the forced inoculation for now, if you're in America, but soon you can't.
[01:21:23.521 --> 01:21:32.408]  They train you to see that incredible message, and then suddenly, oh, suddenly it's not an Amber Alert, suddenly they've taken control of your phone, and you only get the messages they want.
[01:21:32.688 --> 01:21:40.914]  That's what the lockdowns were about, was a beta test of locking in your house for months, and everybody getting the same message, so we can all have the same mass psychosis.
[01:21:42.756 --> 01:21:43.136]  Continue.
[01:21:44.659 --> 01:21:52.327]  Excel confirms to contact Denver 7, 22,000 customers were locked out of their smart thermostats for hours on Tuesday.
[01:21:52.528 --> 01:21:53.729]  It's a voluntary program.
[01:21:53.749 --> 01:21:56.913]  Let's remember that this is something that customers choose to be a part of.
[01:22:01.831 --> 01:22:02.991]  That's the social credit score.
[01:22:03.652 --> 01:22:07.034]  We give you incentives because you won't be able to pay for this unless you do it.
[01:22:07.654 --> 01:22:21.603]  The power prices are so high in the new energy bailouts in Europe and Australia and Canada and the UK, but you're going to opt in to getting your energy bills paid to accept this, but then it won't be opt-in later.
[01:22:23.007 --> 01:22:26.910]  Oh, well, yeah, we confirm we did this, but this is up for our customers.
[01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:27.991]  I mean, they did this.
[01:22:28.371 --> 01:22:30.713]  Though all over the country, they made everybody take these smart meters.
[01:22:31.393 --> 01:22:33.414]  And we told you they do this, and now they did.
[01:22:33.595 --> 01:22:33.935]  Continue.
[01:22:34.568 --> 01:22:42.072]  Customers enrolled in the Colorado AC Rewards Program sign up to get money back, but give up some control for the greater good.
[01:22:42.252 --> 01:22:45.313]  So it helps everybody for people to participate in these programs.
[01:22:45.613 --> 01:22:49.115]  It is a bit uncomfortable for a short period of time, but it's very, very helpful.
[01:22:49.315 --> 01:22:50.215]  And it's rare.
[01:22:50.235 --> 01:22:57.499]  This is the first time since the six-year-old program started that customers could not... Because they put it in place years ago for the rollout.
[01:22:57.799 --> 01:22:59.540]  They've had years hotter than this in the last six years.
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:00.200]  It's all made up.
[01:23:01.441 --> 01:23:02.301]  This is the Great Reset.
[01:23:02.862 --> 01:23:03.662]  They've made their move.
[01:23:04.986 --> 01:23:06.487]  And don't worry, it's going to be rare.
[01:23:06.507 --> 01:23:07.809]  Yeah, we're in control.
[01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.810]  You opted in.
[01:23:09.911 --> 01:23:10.891]  It's for your own choice.
[01:23:12.993 --> 01:23:15.556]  It's the same story over and over again.
[01:23:16.917 --> 01:23:20.520]  Finish this up, and then I want to play the clip for myself 12 years ago.
[01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:22.802]  Just doing a brief little analysis of this.
[01:23:23.143 --> 01:23:23.543]  Here it is.
[01:23:24.103 --> 01:23:25.385]  They're smart thermostats.
[01:23:27.122 --> 01:23:31.304]  Excel says an unexpected outage in Pueblo, combined with hot weather and heavy A.C.
[01:23:31.424 --> 01:23:34.265]  use, led to the last-minute energy emergency.
[01:23:34.465 --> 01:23:44.049]  To me, an emergency means there is, you know, life, limb, or, you know, some other danger out there, some, you know, massive wildfires.
[01:23:44.210 --> 01:23:54.194]  Tony's all about saving energy with solar panels and smart home systems, but he says he had no idea locked thermostats came with that, and it's not what he signed up for.
[01:23:54.634 --> 01:24:00.520]  Even if it's a once in a blue moon situation that just doesn't sit right with us.
[01:24:01.761 --> 01:24:02.802]  Tony's not a bad guy.
[01:24:02.882 --> 01:24:04.544]  He's trying to be part of society.
[01:24:04.564 --> 01:24:08.748]  He believes the social contract is working with us because he believes it's a good endgame.
[01:24:09.249 --> 01:24:09.429]  No.
[01:24:10.069 --> 01:24:16.276]  See, Tony has solar panels on his house, but under law all over the world it's the same system.
[01:24:18.562 --> 01:24:23.366]  You can't have those solar panels in most jurisdictions unless it's into the power system.
[01:24:23.986 --> 01:24:26.248]  They don't want independent solar panels.
[01:24:26.288 --> 01:24:31.933]  The regulators, the zoning department will come out and shut you down in most jurisdictions.
[01:24:34.235 --> 01:24:37.617]  So he's self-sufficient, but he still doesn't get his power.
[01:24:37.958 --> 01:24:38.979]  See how that works?
[01:24:39.659 --> 01:24:40.880]  See how that works, Tony?
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:43.782]  Because this ain't about self-sufficiency, boy.
[01:24:44.043 --> 01:24:45.684]  It's about having you by your balls.
[01:24:46.004 --> 01:24:46.425]  Continue.
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:53.766]  For the AC Rewards Program, customers get a $100 credit for signing up and $25 every year.
[01:24:54.186 --> 01:25:00.233]  In exchange, Accel says the customers should be aware they could lose control of their thermostat in an emergency.
[01:25:00.674 --> 01:25:04.678]  Tony and many others were not aware, and he is now unenrolling.
[01:25:05.459 --> 01:25:14.942]  I mean, if you go back six, seven years ago when they were first trying to use taxpayer money to put them in in California and other areas, it was, oh, don't worry, we won't control your thermostat, we're not going to spy on you.
[01:25:15.702 --> 01:25:27.005]  And industry insiders were going, no, no, no, no, this can gauge all your electrical use and there's switches in all the new appliances that communicate with data down power line and they're also wireless.
[01:25:27.665 --> 01:25:28.706]  And it's going to snoop on you.
[01:25:28.766 --> 01:25:33.608]  Well, now they admit it and said, oh, we are going to control what goes on in your house.
[01:25:33.648 --> 01:25:37.010]  We are going to control how and where you can set it.
[01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:38.190]  So beyond 1984.
[01:25:40.471 --> 01:25:40.991]  Beyond 1984.
[01:25:43.112 --> 01:25:45.814]  And folks, they're just getting started.
[01:25:46.334 --> 01:25:49.315]  Now, let me tell you about the next level of control.
[01:25:49.656 --> 01:25:50.376]  We've covered water.
[01:25:50.416 --> 01:25:51.116]  We've covered power.
[01:25:51.156 --> 01:25:51.837]  We've covered food.
[01:25:51.877 --> 01:25:54.258]  We've covered borders.
[01:25:55.478 --> 01:25:57.619]  But next, the real weapon!
[01:25:58.959 --> 01:26:06.201]  Oh, you're gonna enjoy this one!
[01:26:07.342 --> 01:26:09.822]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[01:26:10.002 --> 01:26:17.002]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:26:17.002 --> 01:26:34.002]   Vitamin Mineral Fusion is your one-stop shop for health, for longevity, for a boosted immune system.
[01:26:33.995 --> 01:26:40.741]  In the climate we live in today, and what the globalists are up to, I think anybody not taking a high-quality product like this is insane.
[01:26:41.041 --> 01:26:45.365]  And there's other great vitamin, mineral, amino acid, you know, complete products out there.
[01:26:45.845 --> 01:26:50.149]  Ours is amongst the very best, and it is a lower cost than many of the leading brands.
[01:26:50.408 --> 01:26:55.848]   But whatever you do, take a high quality, multi-vitamin, mineral, amino acid system like this
[01:26:55.848 --> 01:27:01.408]   that's liquid that you put in water because you have a better absorption rate when you do that.
[01:27:01.408 --> 01:27:04.068]   Now, Vitamin Mineral Fusion is our overall best-selling product.
[01:27:04.068 --> 01:27:07.927]   It finally came in a month ago, and we've almost sold out of the first shipment.
[01:27:07.927 --> 01:27:09.808]  Hopefully more is coming in in a few months.
[01:27:09.808 --> 01:27:13.607]   But if you want to experience Vitamin Mineral Fusion and its effects for yourself,
[01:27:13.607 --> 01:27:17.368]   or maybe you already love it and you wanna stock up, thanks for keeping us on the air

[01:27:27.328 --> 01:27:30.009]  (air whooshing)
[01:27:30.009 --> 01:27:32.667]  (air whooshing)
[01:27:33.027 --> 01:27:35.688]  (air whooshing)
[01:27:35.688 --> 01:27:38.347]  (air whooshing)
[01:27:38.347 --> 01:27:41.009]  (air whooshing)
[01:27:41.009 --> 01:27:43.667]  (air whooshing)
[01:27:43.667 --> 01:27:51.028]  (air whooshing)
[01:27:51.028 --> 01:28:07.808]  (air whooshing)
[01:28:08.248 --> 01:28:10.908]  (air whooshing)
[01:28:10.908 --> 01:28:21.248]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live
[01:28:21.248 --> 01:28:25.567]  Tuesday broadcast.
[01:28:25.687 --> 01:28:31.309]  So, in the famous book written by one of the top Illuminati thinkers, R.C.
[01:28:31.349 --> 01:28:42.751]  Clarke, humans are going out to achieve next-level godhood and merge with the Creator, they later learn by a signal sent from Jupiter.
[01:28:46.445 --> 01:28:53.813]  The HAL 9000 computer that's got everybody in suspended animation except two astronauts kills the crew.
[01:28:53.913 --> 01:28:57.913]  just turns turns their life support off.
[01:28:57.913 --> 01:29:06.553]  Well that's where we are right now.
[01:29:04.503 --> 01:29:09.623]  they're turning the earth's life supports off.
[01:29:09.623 --> 01:29:19.384]  And you can pretend you're part of the power structure.
[01:29:17.729 --> 01:29:19.030]  That's why I laugh at my enemies.
[01:29:19.190 --> 01:29:28.257]  I mean, you know, they never got the offer to go meet Henry Kissinger in New York 15 years ago by the head of the Kissinger Group in front of witnesses.
[01:29:29.277 --> 01:29:33.620]  They never got the offers to be the next Rush Limbaugh.
[01:29:35.602 --> 01:29:37.023]  They didn't say no to those offers.
[01:29:37.063 --> 01:29:40.125]  They don't even know about those offers because they have nothing to offer these people.
[01:29:41.516 --> 01:29:45.418]  The globalists knew that my trajectory was dangerous for them.
[01:29:46.118 --> 01:29:47.419]  They wanted to buy me off.
[01:29:48.719 --> 01:29:49.579]  And I didn't take it.
[01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:51.480]  Because you know what?
[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:53.701]  I'm on Team Human, not Team Demon.
[01:29:55.462 --> 01:29:57.883]  I'm on Team Freedom, not Team Satan.
[01:29:59.159 --> 01:29:59.960]  I'm no hero.
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:01.921]  Man, I'm red-blooded.
[01:30:02.041 --> 01:30:02.981]  I like people.
[01:30:03.682 --> 01:30:05.503]  I'm pissed watching them starve, folks.
[01:30:05.783 --> 01:30:07.624]  I'm pissed watching them screw people over.
[01:30:07.904 --> 01:30:12.647]  I'm angry watching them cause all this friction and block all these real developments we have.
[01:30:13.127 --> 01:30:14.948]  I want the live extension technologies.
[01:30:15.749 --> 01:30:18.390]  I want real freedom and humans have the decision what they want to do.
[01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:19.511]  You want to be a cyborg?
[01:30:19.551 --> 01:30:19.811]  Do it!
[01:30:21.054 --> 01:30:27.054]   But I don't want kids locked up with these iPads and this culture and forced on VR to dumb them down and control them
[01:30:27.054 --> 01:30:31.054]   because globalists don't want competition, because they want to capture the future.
[01:30:31.054 --> 01:30:39.054]  But let's hit the next phase of this takeover.
[01:30:39.054 --> 01:30:49.054]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:30:40.182 --> 01:30:41.042]  You already saw it.
[01:30:41.802 --> 01:30:43.583]  You already got a good taste of it.
[01:30:43.663 --> 01:30:45.204]  You already got a nice look at it.
[01:30:45.224 --> 01:30:48.545]  A lot of you got hurt by it, including myself and my family.
[01:30:51.567 --> 01:30:57.251]  Not just the poison shots, not just the devalued currency, not just the open borders, not just the drag queen pedophile time.
[01:30:58.892 --> 01:31:00.574]  But what is defunding of the police?
[01:31:02.175 --> 01:31:05.697]  Well, it's a federal muscling in on jurisdictions.
[01:31:06.538 --> 01:31:08.660]  On states and counties and cities and towns.
[01:31:10.481 --> 01:31:14.644]  And some of those towns are run by bad people, and some of those areas are run by good people.
[01:31:16.443 --> 01:31:18.764]  You pretty much see if it's a blue area, you know it's bad.
[01:31:18.804 --> 01:31:20.045]  The red's a mix.
[01:31:20.365 --> 01:31:22.006]  It's shot to hell as well.
[01:31:22.846 --> 01:31:26.267]  But the average police officer didn't get that job on a power trip.
[01:31:26.668 --> 01:31:28.008]  They had somebody robbed.
[01:31:28.188 --> 01:31:29.009]  Or they got robbed.
[01:31:29.469 --> 01:31:30.790]  They watched their mother get mugged.
[01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:34.951]  Or they saw somebody shoot their neighbor for no reason when they were a kid.
[01:31:34.991 --> 01:31:40.854]  And you know, they have an instinct to want to help people and wanting to go out and fight bad guys.
[01:31:41.634 --> 01:31:42.535]  They want to be warriors.
[01:31:45.154 --> 01:31:48.196]  Some do it for wrong reasons, but statistically, they're some of the best people we got.
[01:31:48.317 --> 01:31:51.676]   and they got a bad globalist influence trying to get them to do bad things and
[01:31:51.676 --> 01:31:54.076]   they've done some bad things and we shouldn't support them when they're bad.
[01:31:54.076 --> 01:32:03.436]  Man, I got so much to cover.
[01:32:03.668 --> 01:32:05.470]  I haven't even gotten to this next big story yet.
[01:32:07.231 --> 01:32:08.512]  We got a special guest joining us.
[01:32:09.773 --> 01:32:10.914]  I'm gonna hit it, then we'll have the guests.
[01:32:11.795 --> 01:32:12.155]  Stay with us.
[01:32:14.068 --> 01:32:16.551]  Is the sun setting on human liberty?
[01:32:17.973 --> 01:32:19.294]  Or is it rising?
[01:32:20.295 --> 01:32:22.498]  That question is up to us, my friends.
[01:32:24.181 --> 01:32:33.028]  And I'm very, very blessed and honored to be able to have Susan Swift on as one of the leading lawyers with the Right to Life League, which is the oldest pro-life organization in America.
[01:32:33.048 --> 01:32:36.090]  She's also the Vice President of Legal Affairs for the Right to Life League.
[01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:39.773]  Prior to working with pro-life, Susan enjoyed a career in television and films.
[01:32:40.233 --> 01:32:44.897]  She served as a litigation attorney at the prominent international law firm, Downtown Los Angeles.
[01:32:44.917 --> 01:32:51.162]  Susan is the mother of seven children, dedicated to using her speaking and legal skills to champion civil rights for the unborn.
[01:32:51.582 --> 01:32:52.883]  Righttolifeleague.org.
[01:32:53.302 --> 01:32:59.542]   we couldn't get a better guest on, give everybody a report on this big Roe v. Wade victory and
[01:32:59.542 --> 01:33:04.702]   something wonderful that Trump did getting these justices in. It basically counterbalances
[01:33:04.702 --> 01:33:08.662]   some of the things that Trump isn't perfect on. That's why I still support Trump overall,
[01:33:08.662 --> 01:33:13.063]   is the amazing thing that happened there. But that is decades of work by people like
[01:33:13.063 --> 01:33:18.782]   Susan Swift and countless others. Martin Luther King's wife, you name it, the list goes on
[01:33:19.419 --> 01:33:24.267]  And right as the left openly says, yeah, it's a sacrament, yeah, we want to kill babies.
[01:33:24.768 --> 01:33:27.873]  Right as they try to pass laws and pass laws to kill babies after they're born.
[01:33:29.622 --> 01:33:37.452]  There is just a huge awakening of the heart and the mind, particularly statistics show in young people, rejecting this and seeing through it.
[01:33:37.992 --> 01:33:47.905]  And so the Democratic Party that's made threats to the American people and threats to Trump and saying, you have summoned the whirlwind, we're going to destroy you, we want these dead babies.
[01:33:48.665 --> 01:34:06.935]   So to talk about their counter-offensive against us and the incredible legislation and the insane sexualization of children at the same time and how this all ties together is Susan Swift with righttolifeleague.org and there's so much So many points she sent, and articles she sent.
[01:34:06.955 --> 01:34:08.836]  Some of that I don't even know about.
[01:34:08.876 --> 01:34:09.957]  That's just insane.
[01:34:10.297 --> 01:34:14.199]  Planned Parenthood sex ed, teaching 11 year olds they can have sex.
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:18.742]  Planned Parenthood flyers given to 8th graders in the schools.
[01:34:18.842 --> 01:34:20.923]  I mean, this is the leftist cult.
[01:34:22.619 --> 01:34:24.720]  We've got so much to hit here.
[01:34:25.481 --> 01:34:29.643]  Most Californians support limits on abortion, but the establishment doesn't care.
[01:34:29.663 --> 01:34:38.108]  And it's really their pushing of killing third trimester and already born babies that I don't think I know has turned people against them.
[01:34:38.148 --> 01:34:47.540]   So why are they so naked now with famous feminists like You name it, coming out and saying, shirts, I had five abortions.
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:48.420]  I had 10 abortions.
[01:34:48.921 --> 01:34:50.261]  I love Gloria Steinem.
[01:34:50.341 --> 01:34:51.402]  I love killing babies.
[01:34:51.882 --> 01:34:54.764]  And all these comedians bragging about kill those little bastards.
[01:34:55.544 --> 01:34:56.745]  It's just insane.
[01:34:57.665 --> 01:34:59.926]  These people have been taking the mask off.
[01:34:59.946 --> 01:35:01.347]  So Susan Swift's with us for the hour.
[01:35:01.367 --> 01:35:03.168]  I'm gonna try to shut up and give her the floor.
[01:35:03.488 --> 01:35:05.389]  She's got a lot to say, but great to have you here with us.
[01:35:05.749 --> 01:35:06.590]  So much to cover.
[01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.850]  Where should we begin?
[01:35:09.471 --> 01:35:11.632]  Well, first, I want to thank you, Alex.
[01:35:11.672 --> 01:35:13.253]  You are the general of truth.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:21.742]  And since I've spoken to Rush Limbaugh 12 years ago on his radio show, I called in.
[01:35:21.802 --> 01:35:23.082]  I was Susan from Glendale.
[01:35:23.622 --> 01:35:32.885]  This is now the next best thing that's ever happened to me, so it is such an honor to be here on your show speaking to the General of Truth, because that's what I think you are.
[01:35:33.525 --> 01:35:36.966]  Well, just thank you for what you're doing, and I see a lot of positive things happening.
[01:35:37.386 --> 01:35:42.027]  What would you call the current state of the battle for the unborn and for the soul of America?
[01:35:43.393 --> 01:35:47.276]  Well, we are witnessing the California abortion apocalypse.
[01:35:47.636 --> 01:35:49.137]  It is unfolding right now.
[01:35:49.597 --> 01:36:08.611]  What has happened over the last six months is that the Future of Abortion Council, this is 40, I call them the abortion cartel, about 40 different abortion providers, they saw that their market share was going to be crippled by the Dobbs overturning of Roe vs. Wade.
[01:36:08.971 --> 01:36:09.892]  And they went into action.
[01:36:09.932 --> 01:36:11.833]  This is back in probably November, December last year.
[01:36:11.853 --> 01:36:15.015]  And they said, well, we've got to boost up our market share.
[01:36:15.055 --> 01:36:15.755]  What are we going to do?
[01:36:16.076 --> 01:36:26.302]  They got together with Governor Gavin Newsom, who's the governor of California here, and they came out with a plan called the Future of Abortion Recommendations, 15 specific points.
[01:36:26.662 --> 01:36:28.623]  And they started advancing legislation.
[01:36:28.983 --> 01:36:30.463]  They've gotten them all through.
[01:36:30.483 --> 01:36:31.904]  90% of them.
[01:36:32.144 --> 01:36:35.004]  There's at least 15 bills that they've already gotten all through.
[01:36:35.044 --> 01:36:36.165]  They're all enrolled.
[01:36:36.205 --> 01:36:40.226]  They're in various stages of just waiting to get to Governor Newsom's desk.
[01:36:40.706 --> 01:36:46.608]  And what this is, is as he starts signing them, this is ushering in an abortion apocalypse.
[01:36:47.508 --> 01:36:55.470]   It is Abortion on demand, 24-7, no limits, and we'll fly you in here to California.
[01:36:55.750 --> 01:37:06.892]  It's free abortions, free travel, lost wages, you cover your insurance, hotel accommodations, and even child care, I kid you not.
[01:37:07.112 --> 01:37:11.573]  So just bring the kids you want to keep because you can abort the one that's inside, right?
[01:37:11.633 --> 01:37:12.613]  Just keep the ones you want.
[01:37:12.953 --> 01:37:14.034]  That's just one bill.
[01:37:14.074 --> 01:37:14.594]  That's SB 1142.
[01:37:15.914 --> 01:37:18.035]  That's part of the budget now for California.
[01:37:18.696 --> 01:37:26.581]  Another bill that they have advanced and is now it's already enrolled and I believe it's just waiting for the signature of the governor to be chaptered.
[01:37:27.021 --> 01:37:28.342]  That's AB 2223.
[01:37:28.702 --> 01:37:30.323]  That's the infanticide bill.
[01:37:30.663 --> 01:37:43.511]  That's what's going to decriminalize infanticide for all nine months of pregnancy through delivery and into the first 28 days of birth after the baby is born.
[01:37:43.831 --> 01:37:45.132]  I'll explain how this works.
[01:37:45.532 --> 01:38:00.803]  Because they wanted to decriminalize any kind of prosecution of a woman for a miscarriage, for stillbirth, abortion, and the fourth category is perinatal death due to causes that occur in utero.
[01:38:01.143 --> 01:38:04.766]  That's not defined, but I do know what perinatal death means.
[01:38:04.866 --> 01:38:07.288]  Perinatal is after birth.
[01:38:07.628 --> 01:38:09.029]  Prenatal is before birth.
[01:38:09.406 --> 01:38:15.230]  Perinatal is after birth, and in California law, the perinatal period is already defined.
[01:38:15.530 --> 01:38:20.134]  It is defined as the moment of conception through the first month of a child's life.
[01:38:20.794 --> 01:38:29.300]  So, perinatal period starts, right, you know, from delivery on for at least 28 more days, and they decided to weave that in into this category.
[01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:32.763]  Perinatal death due to causes that occur in utero.
[01:38:33.391 --> 01:38:35.153]  We kept asking them, well, what does that mean?
[01:38:35.233 --> 01:38:40.237]  Please, please strike that out because we think that means after-birth abortions, right?
[01:38:40.417 --> 01:38:42.999]  This is how to finish off a botched abortion.
[01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:45.721]  That's what AB 2223 is going to do.
[01:38:45.982 --> 01:39:03.636]   It's going to make it impossible to investigate a mother, a pregnant person, anyone who wants to pretend to be a pregnant person, anyway, it'll protect the mother and Anyone who assists her in her chosen pregnancy outcome.
[01:39:03.856 --> 01:39:07.499]  So that's grandma, that's boyfriend, that's an abortionist, that's a nurse.
[01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:09.241]  Anyone who assists her.
[01:39:09.861 --> 01:39:14.465]  They are all protected from any kind of civil or criminal liability.
[01:39:15.025 --> 01:39:16.026]  Can't investigate them.
[01:39:16.226 --> 01:39:25.990]   Because if you do, you can be charged with a private cause of action, civil damages, $25,000 plus court costs, And attorneys fees.
[01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:33.037]  So practically speaking, what this is going to do is it's going to prevent anyone from even investigating or asking about, well, how did this baby die?
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:36.321]  And here's the interesting thing about AB 2223.
[01:39:36.581 --> 01:39:42.822]  It has already now stripped away the pre-existing laws in California.
[01:39:42.922 --> 01:40:01.867]  In California right now, until AB 2223 is officially signed and in effect, in California we have the Roe vs. Wade model, which is a woman has an absolute right to abortion up to viability, and then after viability she has a right to abortion if the pregnancy endangers her health or welfare or anything like that.
[01:40:01.947 --> 01:40:02.647]  It's a rubber stamp.
[01:40:02.947 --> 01:40:04.428]  But at least she has to go into a doctor.
[01:40:04.728 --> 01:40:13.455]  At least it exists that at around viability you have to at least be seen by a doctor and maybe it's even a pretense but at least there's that in the law.
[01:40:13.995 --> 01:40:16.077]  AB 2223 does away with all that.
[01:40:16.617 --> 01:40:27.944]   It's going to legalize abortion on demand up through all nine months of pregnancy and into a fourth trimester which is After birth, perinatal death due to causes that occur in utero.
[01:40:28.244 --> 01:40:30.465]  Those are just two bills that are happening in California.
[01:40:30.685 --> 01:40:33.645]  So we're going to see women flying in here and being brought in here.
[01:40:33.705 --> 01:40:34.886]  I think it's human trafficking.
[01:40:35.286 --> 01:40:40.547]  Because what they do is they harvest those babies, those living babies, and they sell the baby parts.
[01:40:40.587 --> 01:40:42.688]  We know that from the David DeLeon films, right?
[01:40:43.068 --> 01:41:02.561]   So we're going to be having Abortions on demand, and just like Governor Northam, the former governor of Virginia said, well, let's say we have a botched abortion, either a chemical abortion where the woman takes the chemical pills, mifeprex and misoprostol, and she delivers a baby, right?
[01:41:02.962 --> 01:41:04.223]  And it's still alive.
[01:41:04.323 --> 01:41:08.947]  That happens sometimes when you have chemical abortions or when you have surgical abortions.
[01:41:09.027 --> 01:41:11.029]  The babies are sometimes born alive.
[01:41:11.529 --> 01:41:25.555]  At that point, because of AB 2223, they can let that baby die on a table, or they can smother it, so long as someone can point to the cause that occurred in utero, like the abortion that got botched, right?
[01:41:25.835 --> 01:41:31.457]  As long as you point to that, practically speaking, no one's going to investigate it so long as the mother is consenting.
[01:41:31.517 --> 01:41:32.517]  All right, stay right there.
[01:41:32.597 --> 01:41:34.838]  And this will incentivize even women going in to have babies.
[01:41:34.858 --> 01:41:35.558]  They're going to kill them.
[01:41:35.819 --> 01:41:36.439]  We'll be right back.
[01:41:36.459 --> 01:41:36.779]  Stay with us.
[01:41:40.287 --> 01:41:45.789]  When cultures are in decline on the verge of collapse, they begin to sacrifice and kill their children.
[01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:50.211]  Every ancient culture from the Druids to the Aztecs did it.
[01:41:52.432 --> 01:41:55.433]  And humans are publicly being turned into a commodity.
[01:41:55.994 --> 01:42:05.178]  We've learned all over the country that they are keeping babies alive and then killing them and selling their organs and now they're passing laws to kill them up to a month.
[01:42:06.778 --> 01:42:11.550]   Why are the Democrats And the deep state coming out in the open.
[01:42:11.630 --> 01:42:14.552]  Why are they so arrogant?
[01:42:15.852 --> 01:42:17.033]  Well, because they know we're winning.
[01:42:18.113 --> 01:42:18.874]  And they're panicking.
[01:42:19.614 --> 01:42:21.855]  And this is the most evil thing our culture does.
[01:42:23.496 --> 01:42:32.960]  And we can turn this around, we can turn it all around, and the good news is, in national polls, local polls, particularly young people, are 75 plus percent against this.
[01:42:33.301 --> 01:42:43.738]   We're so close to winning, and when we come against this, we see the rage of the Democratic Party in the deep state because they all want us to be commodities they own.
[01:42:44.159 --> 01:42:45.020]  This is so incredible.
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:50.765]  So Susan Swift, you got cut off getting into the fact this is all about baby part sales.
[01:42:50.785 --> 01:42:51.846]  And I want to just point this out.
[01:42:53.207 --> 01:42:59.432]  I never said this because I want this to happen, but if you look at markets and businesses, conservative estimates are babies worth $50,000, $100,000 for its organs.
[01:43:02.895 --> 01:43:04.597]  A lot of estimates are a half million dollars.
[01:43:04.617 --> 01:43:08.960]  Let's just say, let's split the baby, pun intended, and say $250,000.
[01:43:11.643 --> 01:43:14.645]  Women are going in and paying $300, $400 for an abortion.
[01:43:15.186 --> 01:43:16.047]  That's an illusion.
[01:43:16.747 --> 01:43:20.010]  We know Planned Parenthood and others are selling this and making massive profits.
[01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:24.074]  So now California is openly saying it's a business in body parts.
[01:43:25.444 --> 01:43:26.385]  And baby parts.
[01:43:27.306 --> 01:43:30.428]  And it's like out of a science fiction dystopia, but it's real.
[01:43:30.868 --> 01:43:35.993]  And if we just pull back and look at this and say to women, okay, hey, you ever want to kill your baby?
[01:43:37.374 --> 01:43:39.856]  How about you get a quarter of the money?
[01:43:41.037 --> 01:43:41.897]  How about you get $65,000?
[01:43:42.418 --> 01:43:48.443]  And then that just makes it a commodity up front, and then it's going to stop.
[01:43:49.284 --> 01:43:52.026]  Because you got the left wanting to ban killing cows for meat.
[01:43:53.888 --> 01:43:56.831]  Or medical experiments on rats for cancer cures.
[01:43:57.311 --> 01:43:59.833]  I don't like what's happening to rats, but I'll do it for humans.
[01:44:01.134 --> 01:44:04.797]  But if we just make it all about how it's a commodity, I think it's game over for them.
[01:44:04.817 --> 01:44:08.120]  And I think it's them making it a commodity that's turning everybody against them.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:16.828]  What do you think, from the leading attorneys at the Right to Life League, Susan Swift, what do you think it's really about and why are they out in the open and how do we stop them?
[01:44:18.507 --> 01:44:20.027]  I think you're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:44:20.087 --> 01:44:21.128]  This is about the money.
[01:44:21.528 --> 01:44:29.969]  This is about depopulation and trying to fund it and create a business around the depopulation of human beings.
[01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:34.930]  So yes, I think they are selling baby parts and they're using your taxpayer dollars to do it.
[01:44:35.210 --> 01:44:44.472]  Not just the taxpayer dollars in California, by the way, but all taxpayers because the Biden blue state bailout sent a ton of money to California and other blue states.
[01:44:44.872 --> 01:44:48.993]   Our Their surplus right now in California is close to $100 billion.
[01:44:50.354 --> 01:45:03.578]  If they wanted to actually end abortion by coming alongside women and caring for them and ministering to them, or at least educating young men and young women and saying, hey, let's not have a need for abortion ever again.
[01:45:03.798 --> 01:45:05.519]  These are human beings.
[01:45:05.539 --> 01:45:10.321]  These are little tiny carbon footprints that they're trying to get rid of.
[01:45:10.881 --> 01:45:12.881]  And they're using your taxpayer dollars to do it.
[01:45:13.342 --> 01:45:14.422]  That's the problem here.
[01:45:14.912 --> 01:45:16.672]  Because this is an industry.
[01:45:16.852 --> 01:45:21.353]  As I said, they've lost 27 states, right?
[01:45:21.373 --> 01:45:22.933]  They've lost half of their market share.
[01:45:23.173 --> 01:45:42.317]  So now that they're centralizing in California and other states as well, trying to pass an abortion amendment to the state constitution, which is just, it's a lot of virtue signaling because they already have laws in California that make abortion a constitutional right according to the California State Supreme Court.
[01:45:42.797 --> 01:45:45.077]   And this, This is unholy.
[01:45:45.697 --> 01:45:54.563]  Abortion is an unholy sacrament to empower, I think spiritually, this domination of our population.
[01:45:55.003 --> 01:46:00.937]   Instead of liberty and life, we are celebrating this Domination, control, and death.
[01:46:01.297 --> 01:46:02.258]  That's what abortion is.
[01:46:02.578 --> 01:46:04.260]  And let me clear something up right now.
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:06.422]  Abortion is not healthcare.
[01:46:06.762 --> 01:46:07.643]  That's the lie.
[01:46:07.723 --> 01:46:10.705]  That is the biggest lie that the abortion cartel will tell you.
[01:46:10.886 --> 01:46:12.027]  It is not healthcare.
[01:46:12.387 --> 01:46:16.871]  Abortion is the intentional killing of a human being in the womb.
[01:46:17.151 --> 01:46:17.772]  That's what it is.
[01:46:18.152 --> 01:46:21.737]  It's purpose, the purpose of abortion is not healthcare.
[01:46:21.837 --> 01:46:25.481]  The purpose is specifically to target and eliminate that human being.
[01:46:25.662 --> 01:46:30.127]  And by the way, the Democratic Party and their minions say it is a ritual.
[01:46:30.147 --> 01:46:33.051]  I just put a Fox News headline up.
[01:46:34.215 --> 01:46:48.380]  They have abortion doulas who actually recommend that you create a shrine to your abortion before you do it, and you set up a shrine and kind of have this ritual before you abort your baby with an abortion doula!
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:49.801]  These are real people!
[01:46:49.821 --> 01:46:56.383]  I kid you not, these are like the priestesses, the high priestesses of the abortion cult.
[01:46:56.523 --> 01:46:58.704]  This is an anti-population cult.
[01:46:59.324 --> 01:47:00.086]  And that's what they do.
[01:47:00.226 --> 01:47:02.751]  Abortion dwellers and doulas, that's what they do.
[01:47:03.453 --> 01:47:08.302]  And Planned Parenthood, NAROL, all of the abortion cartel, they profit from this.
[01:47:08.868 --> 01:47:11.829]  They're going to be profiting from the sale of the abortion pill.
[01:47:11.889 --> 01:47:16.051]  And 54% of all abortions happen now with the abortion pill.
[01:47:16.151 --> 01:47:17.552]  It's a chemical abortion.
[01:47:17.972 --> 01:47:32.138]  And this is in the state that, I mean, my goodness, if you don't have organic chicken, right, and beef or pork that has the exact right, you know, proportions for their pen to be big enough, we can't sell it in California.
[01:47:32.158 --> 01:47:36.019]  Everybody's got to be organic and healthful and vegan.
[01:47:36.279 --> 01:47:48.527]   And yet these women, Are taking birth control pills that shut down their ovaries and turn them into sterile machines, and now we're taking abortion pills to interrupt the natural, organic process of pregnancy.
[01:47:48.607 --> 01:47:57.432]  And I was about to say, the science has settled that abortion for a woman, because your body's supposed to have one, it happens, it is so bad.
[01:47:57.652 --> 01:48:00.814]  Cancer rates spike when women have abortions, but they're not telling them that.
[01:48:02.075 --> 01:48:02.576]  No, they're not.
[01:48:02.616 --> 01:48:04.597]  They've covered up those studies.
[01:48:04.817 --> 01:48:08.709]   But yes, your risk goes up with every abortion that you have.
[01:48:09.009 --> 01:48:10.510]  Abortion is dangerous for women.
[01:48:10.590 --> 01:48:20.132]  Just chemical abortions alone, just leaving the baby aside, which I hate to say it that way, but just focusing on the mother, we already know that 26 women have died from taking the abortion pill.
[01:48:20.272 --> 01:48:23.472]  And that's the data that they'll let you see from the Mayo Clinic and the FDA.
[01:48:23.713 --> 01:48:27.833]  They're covering up a lot of the data that they claim in California is privacy.
[01:48:28.033 --> 01:48:30.454]  So you don't know, but a woman can hemorrhage to death.
[01:48:30.754 --> 01:48:31.814]  She can get sepsis.
[01:48:31.995 --> 01:48:35.376]  There are serious side effects to the abortion pill.
[01:48:35.836 --> 01:48:37.537]  I'm not bragging about it.
[01:48:37.577 --> 01:48:38.297]  I repented of it.
[01:48:38.437 --> 01:48:40.578]  I repented of it over 30 years ago.
[01:48:41.098 --> 01:48:47.041]  But I mean, I was involved when I was younger in some abortions and almost every time the woman got really sick after and had big problems.
[01:48:48.203 --> 01:48:50.184]  That's because it goes against their natural function.
[01:48:51.344 --> 01:48:54.465]  Most pregnancies are safe and you can deliver safely.
[01:48:54.766 --> 01:49:10.712]  In the less than 2% that we're even talking about, when the abortion cartel brings up the safety of a woman like an ectopic pregnancy or some sort of genetic anomaly that actually threatens the life of the mother, not the mental well-being of the mother, but the actual life, you know what the solution for that is?
[01:49:11.132 --> 01:49:14.195]  Delivery, and that can be accomplished in minutes sometimes.
[01:49:14.455 --> 01:49:18.319]  Delivery, where you remove the baby and give it a chance at life intact.
[01:49:18.339 --> 01:49:24.064]  You don't crush it and tear it up into little pieces and suck it into a tube and poison it.
[01:49:24.124 --> 01:49:26.466]  And when we do that, we're going to come back and talk about it.
[01:49:26.506 --> 01:49:27.988]  We dehumanize ourselves.
[01:49:28.348 --> 01:49:29.850]  We make ourselves a commodity.
[01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:31.051]  This is so obvious.
[01:49:33.072 --> 01:49:35.675]  How do people, before we go to break, get behind what you're doing?
[01:49:35.695 --> 01:49:39.779]  Because Susan, I know about your organization, I know it's one of the leading groups, but I am really impressed with you.
[01:49:39.799 --> 01:49:42.722]  We're going to continue on, but people need to get behind you guys.
[01:49:42.962 --> 01:49:44.363]  This is one of our main offenses.
[01:49:44.664 --> 01:49:45.445]  We're winning here.
[01:49:45.525 --> 01:49:46.185]  God's watching.
[01:49:46.486 --> 01:49:48.488]  How do folks support righttolifeleague.org?
[01:49:50.145 --> 01:49:51.105]  I'm so glad we got her.
[01:49:51.165 --> 01:49:53.186]  We canceled her Friday because I had other stuff going on.
[01:49:53.006 --> 01:49:57.206]   California we fight bad bills we educate people and most importantly we defend a
[01:49:57.206 --> 01:50:01.126]   whole bunch of clinics centers and maternity homes all up and down the
[01:50:01.126 --> 01:50:04.525]   state we keep their doors open so that they can minister to these women and
[01:50:04.525 --> 01:50:08.765]   tell them please don't you antifuz attacking big-time in California in
[01:50:08.765 --> 01:50:14.286]   like Minnesota and Wisconsin let's talk about that we come back Wow amazing I'm
[01:50:14.286 --> 01:50:16.845]   so glad we got her we canceled her Friday because I had other stuff going
[01:50:16.845 --> 01:50:23.926]   on so glad she's here the definition of repent in Webster's Merriam-Webster's I
[01:50:23.926 --> 01:50:29.846]   think number one's the most accurate return from sin to dedicate oneself to
[01:50:29.846 --> 01:50:45.713]   the amendment of one's life My entire course against the New World Order was when I was literally touched by God, when I'd been involved in abortions, and my dad learned about it, and he literally challenged me and he said, stop killing my grandchildren.
[01:50:47.188 --> 01:50:50.691]  And I said, oh, we killed it in the first trimester.
[01:50:50.711 --> 01:50:51.371]  It's not really a baby.
[01:50:51.411 --> 01:50:52.552]  He said, you know, that's not true.
[01:50:53.453 --> 01:50:56.956]  And then over the months, I thought about that and really got touched by it.
[01:50:56.976 --> 01:50:57.576]  I repented.
[01:50:58.577 --> 01:51:00.319]  And then the whole world opened up to me.
[01:51:00.599 --> 01:51:08.585]  And this is a ritual they're conducting to cut you off from God, not just to kill new souls coming into the world and stealing their future and stealing their destiny.
[01:51:08.605 --> 01:51:11.788]  But it devalues you and it cuts you off from God.
[01:51:13.368 --> 01:51:20.138]  So the left always, when I talk about how I was involved, you know, funding abortions, they say, oh, look, he's a hypocrite.
[01:51:20.178 --> 01:51:21.079]  He's against abortion.
[01:51:21.099 --> 01:51:21.720]  He admits he's done it.
[01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:26.487]  No, it's like saying, oh, he's an admitted murderer, but he went to jail for 10 years and got out.
[01:51:26.527 --> 01:51:27.588]  And he says murder's wrong.
[01:51:28.209 --> 01:51:28.710]  No, I'm.
[01:51:29.739 --> 01:51:30.320]  Reproved.
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:31.281]  I've repented.
[01:51:31.341 --> 01:51:32.962]  It's not like I'm on some high horse.
[01:51:33.022 --> 01:51:33.763]  I tell that story.
[01:51:33.783 --> 01:51:35.404]  I mean, I look at my four children.
[01:51:35.444 --> 01:51:37.266]  My son's 20 in a couple days.
[01:51:37.907 --> 01:51:38.527]  My older daughter's 18.
[01:51:39.368 --> 01:51:40.489]  My middle daughter's 14.
[01:51:40.850 --> 01:51:41.470]  My little daughter's 5.
[01:51:42.011 --> 01:51:44.413]  I would die right now for them.
[01:51:44.453 --> 01:51:45.694]  They are so amazing.
[01:51:45.774 --> 01:51:46.095]  So good.
[01:51:46.115 --> 01:51:46.595]  They're everything.
[01:51:46.955 --> 01:51:56.461]   And then I'm punished enough knowing these Amazing women when I was growing up that would say, I'm going to get an abortion.
[01:51:56.481 --> 01:51:57.422]  I didn't fight what they were doing.
[01:51:57.462 --> 01:51:58.143]  I didn't say anything.
[01:51:58.443 --> 01:52:05.731]  And those women would always get mad at me after they had the abortion and our relationship would end when I should have just said, I want that baby.
[01:52:05.751 --> 01:52:07.313]  They would say, well, you didn't stop me.
[01:52:07.333 --> 01:52:08.294]  And now you don't love me.
[01:52:08.814 --> 01:52:09.996]  I would be so upset after it.
[01:52:10.996 --> 01:52:12.057]  And it's just a terrible thing.
[01:52:12.777 --> 01:52:15.780]  So this is playing God, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:18.642]  And when we do it, we cut ourselves off from God.
[01:52:18.682 --> 01:52:21.644]  But the good news is, the heart of the world is waking up.
[01:52:22.185 --> 01:52:23.886]  All over the world, people are turning against this.
[01:52:24.327 --> 01:52:28.770]  And our enemies are making it a commodity, as they always planned, and saying, yeah, it's a baby.
[01:52:28.930 --> 01:52:29.991]  Yeah, we're killing babies.
[01:52:30.331 --> 01:52:31.272]  I could play you hours.
[01:52:31.312 --> 01:52:39.879]  We played the clips of just Democrat leaders and around the world, leftists and Hollywood people and comedians making jokes about this.
[01:52:40.439 --> 01:52:43.340]  We make a joke on ourselves.
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:52.764]  So you've got a lot to cover, Susan Swift, who is Vice President of Legal Affairs, the Right to Life League, righttolifeleague.org, incredibly articulate, to cover the waterfront here.
[01:52:52.784 --> 01:52:54.304]  But I want you to answer these questions for me.
[01:52:54.845 --> 01:52:59.947]  Why do you think the enemy is so flagrant and so arrogant when I see it backfiring on them?
[01:52:59.967 --> 01:53:00.767]  Can they not help it?
[01:53:01.267 --> 01:53:03.468]  And are they so angry we're winning?
[01:53:04.568 --> 01:53:05.909]  Or are they trying to normalize it?
[01:53:06.549 --> 01:53:12.113]  And then what do we do to stop this legislation in places like California?
[01:53:12.173 --> 01:53:13.594]  Because there's federal law.
[01:53:14.235 --> 01:53:17.997]  If you kill a one-day-old baby, you go to the lethal injection.
[01:53:18.437 --> 01:53:22.480]  So just because they change definitions, I don't see how they get away with that.
[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:23.601]  So why are they doing it?
[01:53:23.681 --> 01:53:25.542]  Why are they saying, open A?
[01:53:26.023 --> 01:53:28.324]  And then B, how do we counter them?
[01:53:28.344 --> 01:53:32.207]  And what do you think the next stage of this fight is going to be with this big Roe v. Wade decision?
[01:53:33.568 --> 01:53:33.748]  Sure.
[01:53:34.485 --> 01:53:37.932]  Why are they doing it as outwardly as they are right now?
[01:53:37.952 --> 01:53:39.755]  It's because they are losing and they know it.
[01:53:40.015 --> 01:53:41.799]  Because the science is against them.
[01:53:41.979 --> 01:53:43.001]  Follow the science.
[01:53:43.562 --> 01:53:45.406]  Where does a baby come from?
[01:53:46.306 --> 01:53:47.627]  It's not the stork.
[01:53:48.188 --> 01:53:56.695]  A baby comes from a fertilized ovum, from a sperm and an egg coming together, and at that moment there is a miraculous little burst of light.
[01:53:57.035 --> 01:54:08.725]  No one actually understands how that happens, but that little bit of light, it sparks, and that moment is when that new DNA, that new double helix forms, and that is the beginning of human life.
[01:54:09.165 --> 01:54:17.269]  And left alone, nine times out of ten, more than nine times out of ten, that baby develops and grows and becomes a human being that you and I know.
[01:54:17.349 --> 01:54:17.770]  Guess what?
[01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:21.071]  One of the other lies they like to say is that, oh, it's just a clump of cells.
[01:54:21.091 --> 01:54:23.973]  You might have heard that yourself, maybe back 20, 30 years ago.
[01:54:24.213 --> 01:54:25.153]  That was one of the lies.
[01:54:25.173 --> 01:54:26.194]  I have news for you.
[01:54:26.909 --> 01:54:27.870]  I'm a clump of cells.
[01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:29.271]  You're a clump of cells.
[01:54:29.491 --> 01:54:31.372]  We're all clumps of cells walking around.
[01:54:31.792 --> 01:54:32.753]  That's what life is.
[01:54:32.853 --> 01:54:34.834]  Human life are clumps of cells.
[01:54:35.315 --> 01:54:43.060]  And so you can't point to a point from conception and say, oh, well, I can dismiss that because that's dehumanizing.
[01:54:43.540 --> 01:54:45.342]  That is a human being.
[01:54:45.623 --> 01:54:47.585]  They have done this throughout history.
[01:54:47.825 --> 01:54:49.767]  These are the population controllers.
[01:54:49.968 --> 01:54:51.209]  They did this with slavery.
[01:54:51.409 --> 01:54:54.853]  They made black people to appear to be subhuman.
[01:54:55.313 --> 01:55:01.020]  John Malthus, the entire history of racism in America is based on a lie.
[01:55:01.778 --> 01:55:06.882]  That black people were subhuman or not worthy of life, that you could own them, that they were property.
[01:55:07.063 --> 01:55:07.843]  They were like cattle.
[01:55:08.204 --> 01:55:11.046]  That was a lie and it was a vicious thing that they promoted.
[01:55:11.486 --> 01:55:12.848]  And that is what is happening now.
[01:55:13.128 --> 01:55:16.691]  The abortion issue is the civil rights issue of our time.
[01:55:16.931 --> 01:55:19.693]  And it is so important because it will right the wrong.
[01:55:19.713 --> 01:55:23.377]  The lie is that human life is not sacred.
[01:55:23.617 --> 01:55:27.300]  Human life is a product, a commodity, as you've just said.
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:28.401]  That is a lie.
[01:55:28.701 --> 01:55:31.724]  And this is why they're becoming so desperate right now.
[01:55:31.924 --> 01:55:45.056]  We're winning because thanks be to God, thanks be to Donald Trump, and thanks be to those five justices on the Supreme Court, they have reversed Roe vs. Wade, which was an assault on our Constitution.
[01:55:45.396 --> 01:55:56.383]  From the moment that it was decided, Roe vs. Wade, it took a big federal heavy boot and put it across the United States and said, this is a right that you can now enjoy, the right to abortion.
[01:55:56.703 --> 01:56:00.025]  And you can do it, the trimester system, viability, they kept tinkering with it.
[01:56:00.205 --> 01:56:06.069]  But they had taken away the right of we, the people, to decide what was going to be happening in our states.
[01:56:06.329 --> 01:56:10.770]  They went against all of the history of our country, even before it was even founded.
[01:56:11.110 --> 01:56:12.191]  All of our states, everything.
[01:56:12.211 --> 01:56:14.811]  There was never a right to abortion.
[01:56:15.051 --> 01:56:21.593]  And Justice Alito went through that decision brilliantly and articulated the entire history of the United States about this issue.
[01:56:21.913 --> 01:56:23.113]  And they cured it.
[01:56:23.453 --> 01:56:25.794]  They cured the error that was Roe v. Wade.
[01:56:25.974 --> 01:56:29.275]  There was no right to abortion in our Constitution.
[01:56:29.355 --> 01:56:29.875]  Never was.
[01:56:30.115 --> 01:56:30.755]  Never will be.
[01:56:30.975 --> 01:56:31.435]  There isn't.
[01:56:31.535 --> 01:56:32.896]  And that has now been fixed.
[01:56:33.316 --> 01:56:37.278]   And now, The abortion cartel is desperate because they are losing market share.
[01:56:37.458 --> 01:56:38.418]  They're losing these states.
[01:56:38.838 --> 01:56:42.480]  Louisiana just shut down three abortion clinics, the last ones.
[01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:45.482]  So now life is being valued again, right?
[01:56:45.762 --> 01:56:51.325]  And now they're kind of circling the wagons out here in California and other states because they want to promote abortion.
[01:56:51.345 --> 01:56:54.726]  They have to get you to use your money to kill babies.
[01:56:55.106 --> 01:56:56.387]  They want to involve you.
[01:56:56.447 --> 01:57:01.129]  As you said, they are trying to interrupt the mother's relationship with God.
[01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:09.398]   This is an assault On her soul, if we step out of the civil rights issue just for a moment and we focus on the mother, this is an assault on the mother.
[01:57:09.418 --> 01:57:14.064]  We're trying to tell this mother that somehow abortion is going to be the quick fix for their life.
[01:57:14.484 --> 01:57:17.348]  That's another lie they tell you that, oh, you can't have a career.
[01:57:17.948 --> 01:57:19.209]  You're not going to have your education.
[01:57:19.229 --> 01:57:21.150]  You're not going to have a life that you deserve.
[01:57:21.391 --> 01:57:22.131]  That's a lie.
[01:57:22.291 --> 01:57:23.492]  I'm a mother of seven.
[01:57:23.752 --> 01:57:24.833]  I've been to law school.
[01:57:24.973 --> 01:57:28.015]  I've made wise choices in my life, and I worked really, really hard.
[01:57:28.495 --> 01:57:31.998]  And so it's a lie to say pregnancy interrupts your career path.
[01:57:32.018 --> 01:57:40.784]  That's another lie because they want to interrupt what the mother is experiencing with God, that creative force, that joining of saying, I can create life.
[01:57:41.244 --> 01:57:43.345]  I want to agree with you.
[01:57:43.525 --> 01:57:49.288]  Sex is a sacred ritual God created, and the child is trillions of times more powerful.
[01:57:49.608 --> 01:57:51.249]  This is real power.
[01:57:51.309 --> 01:57:52.269]  This is reality.
[01:57:52.729 --> 01:57:57.292]  And people need to realize that the human process of men and women and children is who we are.
[01:57:57.332 --> 01:57:59.953]  And to attack that is attacking humanity itself.
[01:58:01.064 --> 01:58:01.384]  It does.
[01:58:01.504 --> 01:58:06.105]  It is actually an attack against the earthly trinity, if you would, right?
[01:58:06.125 --> 01:58:09.646]  Because these demons cannot attack God directly.
[01:58:09.866 --> 01:58:10.406]  So what do they do?
[01:58:10.446 --> 01:58:14.847]  They attack the family, the mother, the father, and then the Holy Spirit that creates life.
[01:58:15.187 --> 01:58:17.027]  And that is what they're trying to do, is break up.
[01:58:17.207 --> 01:58:18.388]  They want to break up marriages.
[01:58:18.408 --> 01:58:20.368]  They want to break up dedicated couples.
[01:58:20.588 --> 01:58:22.989]  And they do it by killing this baby.
[01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:24.729]  And it devastates women.
[01:58:24.769 --> 01:58:31.791]   We know from the information that we receive from the different pro-life clinics and pro-life centers, And we didn't get to that.
[01:58:31.831 --> 01:58:33.632]  We'll talk about that coming up.
[01:58:33.672 --> 01:58:36.413]  The harassment of these pro-women, pro-baby clinics.
[01:58:36.273 --> 01:58:39.552]  as well. It is a risk you take. And we didn't get to that.
[01:58:39.552 --> 01:58:47.573]   We'll talk about that coming up. The harassment of these pro-women, pro-baby clinics. Yes. Tell us about those
[01:58:47.573 --> 01:58:51.592]  briefly before we go to break. Oh, that's Jane's revenge.
[01:58:51.952 --> 01:58:53.532]  It's a domestic terrorist organization.
[01:58:53.732 --> 01:59:03.275]  They started threatening, as soon as they got the leaked decision of Dobbs, even before it was released, they started threatening, you know, the Night of Rage, and they're targeting pro-life clinics.
[01:59:03.295 --> 01:59:09.157]  These are little non-profit medical clinics that they just want to offer help to women.
[01:59:09.757 --> 01:59:16.784]  Yeah, they're claiming it's a woman's choice, so a group's here to say, hey, we'll take care of you, we'll help you, and they're firebombing them in places like Wisconsin.
[01:59:16.804 --> 01:59:17.664]  We're going to come right back.
[01:59:18.065 --> 01:59:19.606]  Everybody's got a bookmarked this URL.
[01:59:19.626 --> 01:59:20.487]  Everybody's got to share it.
[01:59:20.827 --> 01:59:22.229]  Righttolifeleague.org.
[01:59:22.789 --> 01:59:23.670]  Folks, you've got to do it.
[01:59:23.870 --> 01:59:26.012]  Righttolifeleague.org.
[01:59:26.452 --> 01:59:27.894]  Righttolifeleague.
[01:59:28.034 --> 01:59:28.434]  One word.
[01:59:28.554 --> 01:59:30.696]  Righttolifeleague.org.
[01:59:30.716 --> 01:59:33.258]  This is the front lines of the fight for humanity.
[01:59:33.479 --> 01:59:34.079]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:34.099 --> 01:59:34.440]  Stay with us.
[01:59:35.529 --> 01:59:39.550]  My California dream is we can free that state of the satanic stronghold it's become.
[01:59:41.351 --> 01:59:51.373]  People that serve evil don't understand that by increment they get deeper and deeper and they're so unhappy and they think becoming a worse person will somehow empower them.
[01:59:51.433 --> 01:59:51.633]  No.
[01:59:52.233 --> 01:59:53.654]  Turn against the darkness.
[01:59:54.154 --> 01:59:54.974]  Come back to God.
[01:59:55.174 --> 01:59:55.594]  Repent.
[01:59:56.514 --> 01:59:57.195]  We'll forgive you.
[01:59:57.275 --> 01:59:57.835]  I'll forgive you.
[01:59:57.895 --> 01:59:59.295]  God will forgive you most importantly.
[01:59:59.755 --> 02:00:00.615]  None of us are perfect.
[02:00:01.276 --> 02:00:02.556]  But we didn't know what we were doing.
[02:00:03.723 --> 02:00:08.285]  And as they know the public wakes up to how evil this is, they go, fine, we are killing babies, big deal.
[02:00:08.785 --> 02:00:10.006]  Yeah, it is Satanism, big deal.
[02:00:10.266 --> 02:00:15.949]  And they want people to join them in that act of incredible corruption.
[02:00:16.689 --> 02:00:19.170]  Susan Swift, we've got like seven, eight minutes left.
[02:00:19.190 --> 02:00:20.191]  I want to thank you so much.
[02:00:20.211 --> 02:00:21.832]  I want to invite you back again.
[02:00:22.672 --> 02:00:26.734]  What else do you want to impart to the viewers and listeners about the critical point humanity's at right now?
[02:00:28.345 --> 02:00:29.987]  I will tell you what's going on in California.
[02:00:30.207 --> 02:00:36.555]  They're on the offensive, and this is why we need every person to be able to help in this battle for life over evil.
[02:00:36.815 --> 02:00:44.444]  What they're doing in California, they picked up the mantra that, you know, Focahontas, Senator Elizabeth Warren had come out with several weeks ago.
[02:00:44.925 --> 02:00:48.449]  She wants all of these pro-life clinics and centers to be shut down.
[02:00:48.849 --> 02:00:49.650]  That's what she said.
[02:00:50.050 --> 02:00:56.913]  And what's happening in California, they advanced a bill, AB 2586, which is now, it's enrolled in a grossing, it's coming right now.
[02:00:57.173 --> 02:01:02.696]  What the original draft of that bill called these pro-life centers and clinics, fake clinics.
[02:01:03.156 --> 02:01:03.817]  That's what it did.
[02:01:03.917 --> 02:01:27.528]   Now they've softened the language of that bill, but the city attorney, Mike Foyer, Los Angeles City Attorney, and the OG, Rob Bonta of California, they have put out consumer alerts They're basically trying to mobilize foot soldiers to suggest to go after these pro-life clinics and centers and probably maternity homes to basically sue them for fraud.
[02:01:27.889 --> 02:01:40.354]  That's what they're saying is that if your website delays anyone from getting the abortion that they want, we're going to come after you and we're going to shut you down because it is a consumer fraud.
[02:01:40.715 --> 02:01:41.355]  That's what they're doing.
[02:01:41.375 --> 02:01:45.457]  That's what they're suing me saying because I'm pro-gun is a consumer fraud.
[02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:47.210]  That's right.
[02:01:47.450 --> 02:01:52.072]  So they're trying to weaponize the law against pro-life clinics, centers, and homes.
[02:01:52.412 --> 02:01:55.673]  Another bill that they advanced and got through is AB 532.
[02:01:56.313 --> 02:02:04.176]  This is demonic because what they did is they added into California a new category of civil rights for employment law.
[02:02:04.496 --> 02:02:07.897]  It's called reproductive health care decision-making.
[02:02:08.137 --> 02:02:15.561]   You can't discriminate now if you're an employer against someone for their reproductive Health care decision-making.
[02:02:15.841 --> 02:02:24.609]  So I don't know how that's going to be applied, but if you're a pro-life clinic and you want to hire somebody and they are very, very pro-abortion, they haven't repented, they... Well, it's clear.
[02:02:24.649 --> 02:02:26.972]  They're going to send those people in and try to get the jobs.
[02:02:27.771 --> 02:02:28.712]  That's exactly right.
[02:02:29.012 --> 02:02:29.773]  That's what's happening.
[02:02:29.793 --> 02:02:36.698]  They are weaponizing, they're taking our laws that should be applied uniformly to all citizens, they're weaponizing them against pro-life.
[02:02:36.718 --> 02:02:39.020]  That's how desperate they are because they're losing.
[02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:58.174]   And what we do out here at the Right to Life League, we challenge that legislation, we educate the public about the truth of abortion, and then what we do, and this is something that no other group does in America as far as I know, We offer free services to the pro-life clinics and centers and maternity homes that we offer to our members.
[02:02:58.455 --> 02:02:59.895]  We say, do you need any HR help?
[02:02:59.915 --> 02:03:00.716]  Do you need admin?
[02:03:00.736 --> 02:03:01.937]  Do you need legal tips?
[02:03:02.017 --> 02:03:11.483]  And what do you need to make sure that you stay open so that you jump through all of the corporate hoops in California to make sure you're properly incorporated and you're filing your papers on time?
[02:03:11.723 --> 02:03:27.899]   And what about all of the medical clinic, all of the The different medical requirements, policies, the procedures, everything that you have to do in California to stay open so that you are immune from attack by this weaponized group of people who are going to come and try to sue you.
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:28.920]  That's what we do.
[02:03:29.221 --> 02:03:30.803]  No one else does that as far as I know.
[02:03:30.843 --> 02:03:36.629]  Now I bet you all the Planned Parenthood clinics, they can just pick up the hotline and talk to the in-house lawyers.
[02:03:36.929 --> 02:03:41.172]  But these pregnancy clinics and centers and homes in California, they have no one to help them.
[02:03:41.253 --> 02:03:51.101]  And let's not forget in San Francisco in the last six, seven years, the groups that infiltrated, got the recordings, they're admitting we're selling the bodies, we're buying Ferraris and Lamborghinis.
[02:03:51.581 --> 02:03:53.823]  They had huge judgments against them, but it doesn't matter.
[02:03:53.903 --> 02:03:55.484]  They did the right thing for these unborn.
[02:03:55.804 --> 02:03:56.485]  This is a war.
[02:03:56.545 --> 02:03:58.186]  We should expect to be attacked.
[02:03:58.466 --> 02:03:59.647]  We're trying to save children.
[02:03:59.667 --> 02:04:02.550]  So just deal with it, folks, and engage the enemy.
[02:04:03.786 --> 02:04:04.166]  That's right.
[02:04:04.206 --> 02:04:06.047]  What we need are boots on the ground here in California.
[02:04:06.067 --> 02:04:10.569]  We're losing a lot of people moving out because they don't want to live in, you know, the People's Republic of California.
[02:04:10.609 --> 02:04:11.149]  I don't blame them.
[02:04:11.209 --> 02:04:11.810]  I understand it.
[02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:13.290]  But we need boots on the ground here.
[02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:14.911]  And that's what the Right to Life League does.
[02:04:14.931 --> 02:04:20.774]  Well, those of you that choose to stay in California are like the Stay Behind Network special forces who are critical.
[02:04:20.794 --> 02:04:23.715]  I mean, you're the most brave people there are.
[02:04:23.815 --> 02:04:24.455]  I guess you're right.
[02:04:24.555 --> 02:04:25.155]  I guess we are.
[02:04:25.195 --> 02:04:27.577]  We are the special forces of the pro-life movement.
[02:04:27.657 --> 02:04:28.277]  That would be us.
[02:04:29.343 --> 02:04:36.289]  Because I saw Biden, he said yesterday, his administration, California is the model for abortion across the country.
[02:04:37.269 --> 02:04:40.912]  Yes, and they have, they've enacted, I mean, they've passed all 15 of these laws.
[02:04:41.172 --> 02:04:43.554]  Look, all they have to do is, they have it as a template now.
[02:04:43.975 --> 02:04:49.139]  And what if, if these pro-aborts gain control of the Federal House and Senate again?
[02:04:49.439 --> 02:04:56.426]   They will take the California model, the abortion apocalypse legislation, And they will roll it across the United States, and they will put it into federal law.
[02:04:56.546 --> 02:04:57.508]  We know that they want to do it.
[02:04:57.548 --> 02:04:58.809]  That's the Women's Health Protection Act.
[02:04:58.829 --> 02:04:59.570]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:04:59.591 --> 02:05:06.500]  I've asked it a few times, and you've made great points, but why do you think the Democrats have come so out in the open and said, yeah, they're babies, we love killing babies.
[02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:10.045]  Why are they flaunting all this when it turns people against them?
[02:05:11.670 --> 02:05:13.210]  I don't know if they think that it is.
[02:05:13.690 --> 02:05:17.451]  I wonder if they have some sort of secret, you know, lock on the elections again.
[02:05:17.631 --> 02:05:18.772]  They are so arrogant.
[02:05:19.012 --> 02:05:21.532]  Are they going to be able to cheat again, like 2020?
[02:05:22.132 --> 02:05:22.973]  Is that what's happening here?
[02:05:23.133 --> 02:05:27.073]  They are so arrogant in their modeling of death.
[02:05:27.674 --> 02:05:30.494]  And maybe they, do you think they're talking to their base?
[02:05:31.054 --> 02:05:38.903]   As you said, we've got stats saying 75% Of the next generation, the young generation, oppose abortion on demand.
[02:05:39.204 --> 02:05:44.513]  So I don't know why they're doing that other than they think that this is a winning... Look, what have they got to run on?
[02:05:45.969 --> 02:05:48.030]  The economy is in the tank, right?
[02:05:48.070 --> 02:05:51.211]  We've got wars starting all over the globe, right?
[02:05:51.451 --> 02:05:57.192]  And inflation is going to go through the roof and people are going to be freezing cold and not have enough food.
[02:05:57.692 --> 02:06:01.934]  And so, yeah, we better add in abortion because that'll make everybody vote for us.
[02:06:02.294 --> 02:06:03.434]  That's all they've got.
[02:06:03.814 --> 02:06:06.575]  They're losing and they're desperate and they're afraid.
[02:06:06.655 --> 02:06:10.476]  And I think they're serving their masters, which is the abortion cartel.
[02:06:10.516 --> 02:06:11.076]  I agree.
[02:06:11.116 --> 02:06:14.177]  They're losing, so they're just firing all their guns at once.
[02:06:15.086 --> 02:06:16.027]  Yep, that's what they're doing.
[02:06:16.047 --> 02:06:19.771]  And the abortion cartel is calling the shots because that's where the money comes.
[02:06:19.852 --> 02:06:22.835]  It's a big government laundry money system, right?
[02:06:23.015 --> 02:06:34.708]   So that they fund the legislators that get these radical policies and then the policies go into effect and more money flows into the Let me ask you this question in closing.
[02:06:34.808 --> 02:06:35.808]  What are they going to pull next?
[02:06:35.848 --> 02:06:40.552]  Because their escalation of just satanic rhetoric has gone off the chart, but it's going straight up.
[02:06:40.592 --> 02:06:41.412]  What are they going to do next?
[02:06:41.893 --> 02:06:44.795]  I mean, they're passing laws that you can have sex with kids.
[02:06:44.835 --> 02:06:46.156]  I mean, it's just, it's insane.
[02:06:47.165 --> 02:06:49.226]  They are trying to separate parents from children.
[02:06:49.666 --> 02:06:58.188]  They already got a bill that they're trying to basically capture children who get here to California and want to have a sex change operation.
[02:06:58.368 --> 02:07:04.490]  They're trying to make that the state can take custody of that child and interrupt the parental rights.
[02:07:04.590 --> 02:07:05.430]  Just like Canada.
[02:07:05.450 --> 02:07:10.872]  So it's going to be a euthanasia, abortion, chop your son's genitals off, haven of evil.
[02:07:12.202 --> 02:07:22.771]  Yeah, because if they can make the individual the commodity of the state, the cog in the global workers' paradise, right, then that's all you are.
[02:07:22.791 --> 02:07:33.560]   And I wouldn't be surprised if they're going to experiment with getting artificial wombs, like something out of Logan's Run, and they're going to start Exactly, genetic engineering, they're already doing it.
[02:07:34.100 --> 02:07:35.021]  California's leading that.
[02:07:35.442 --> 02:07:36.082]  I'm impressed.
[02:07:36.142 --> 02:07:37.403]  Susan Swift, I knew who you were.
[02:07:37.784 --> 02:07:39.005]  I've seen you online before.
[02:07:39.085 --> 02:07:40.306]  Righttolifeleague.org.
[02:07:40.646 --> 02:07:42.087]  Please join us on a routine basis.
[02:07:42.107 --> 02:07:42.888]  Come on the other shows.
[02:07:43.328 --> 02:07:44.509]  Righttolifeleague.org.
[02:07:44.569 --> 02:07:45.090]  God bless you.
[02:07:46.147 --> 02:07:47.909]  God bless you and God bless America.
[02:07:47.969 --> 02:07:48.710]  Thank you so much.
[02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:50.311]  That was powerful, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:50.852 --> 02:07:52.493]  The left can't even form a sentence.
[02:07:53.094 --> 02:07:54.915]  You look at that lady, she is literally on fire.
[02:07:55.276 --> 02:07:56.657]  They claim they're for women empowerment.
[02:07:56.997 --> 02:08:00.681]  Women empowerment is women leading their lives and not being cogs of the machine.
[02:08:00.981 --> 02:08:03.383]  Wow, I am really excited about the interview.
[02:08:03.403 --> 02:08:05.025]  All right, we got a guest host coming up.
[02:08:05.566 --> 02:08:07.928]  But I mentioned this, I wasn't looking at the clock right.
[02:08:09.557 --> 02:08:13.041]  Then I realized that I didn't get to this big, big lawlessness story.
[02:08:13.481 --> 02:08:21.950]  The next move of the Great Reset in Illinois, which again, Illinois, California, New York, those are the incubators of this tyranny.
[02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:23.692]  We're going to hit this when we come back.
[02:08:23.732 --> 02:08:28.477]  They are legalizing second-degree murder of adults.
[02:08:29.537 --> 02:08:35.699]  So kill the old people euthanasia, abort the babies, kill the newborn babies, and now just lawlessly kill whoever you want.
[02:08:35.719 --> 02:08:36.280]  That's coming up.
[02:08:36.620 --> 02:08:38.480]  I'll hit that for five minutes and the guest host takes over.
[02:08:38.801 --> 02:08:43.862]  But separately, this operation is having extreme victory against the new world order.
[02:08:43.903 --> 02:08:44.763]  Thanks for your support.
[02:08:44.823 --> 02:08:46.103]  We need your support now more than ever.

[02:08:49.805 --> 02:08:50.885]  Today is the last day.
[02:08:50.905 --> 02:08:52.806]  It will end tomorrow.
[02:08:53.066 --> 02:08:55.367]  DNA Force Plus, 50% off.
[02:08:55.867 --> 02:08:57.128]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.

[02:09:00.779 --> 02:09:04.578]  A whole bunch of stuff is 50 to 40% off.
[02:09:04.578 --> 02:09:05.979]  It ends tomorrow.
[02:09:05.979 --> 02:09:07.378]  We've sold out a lot of it.
[02:09:07.378 --> 02:09:08.979]  It'll be a while till we get more.
[02:09:10.162 --> 02:09:12.704]  I'm going to hit this big news on the police state when we come back.
[02:09:12.543 --> 02:09:15.962]   all over, so incredible for your immune system, your cardiovascular system.
[02:09:15.962 --> 02:09:21.243]   It'll still be 40% off, but everything else, DNA Force Plus, and body's ultimate tumor formula,
[02:09:21.243 --> 02:09:24.643]  and the vitamin refusion, it all ends tomorrow morning.

[02:09:31.144 --> 02:09:34.563]   And all glory goes to God and the listeners that have been incredible.
[02:09:34.563 --> 02:09:37.783]  All right, I'm gonna hit this big news on the police state.
[02:09:37.783 --> 02:09:39.382]  When we come back, stay with us.
[02:09:39.382 --> 02:09:41.963]  (upbeat music)
[02:09:41.963 --> 02:09:44.543]  (upbeat music)
[02:09:44.543 --> 02:09:52.104]   Ultimate fish oil is back in stock at infowarestore.com.
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:53.301]  What does ultimate mean?
[02:09:54.083 --> 02:09:57.288]  That's just our name for the best, the highest grade.
[02:09:58.487 --> 02:10:13.999]  What this concentrated anchovy oil, pure arctic krill oil, and high quality wild caught salmon oil does for your brain, your heart, your cardiovascular system, and for your entire body's functions is insane.
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:19.284]  Regular low grade fish oil in all the studies does outstanding things.
[02:10:19.884 --> 02:10:27.127]  This is the highest grade, and it's not been pasteurized, it's not been boiled, so it has its original effects intact.

[02:10:38.931 --> 02:10:39.711]  You already know how great it is.
[02:10:39.731 --> 02:10:44.053]  But for folks that have been on the fence, experience Ultimate Fish Oil for yourself.
[02:10:44.573 --> 02:10:47.254]  Try taking some before bedtime and see what happens with your dreams.
[02:10:47.665 --> 02:11:01.031]  Alright folks, I'm going to host this segment, a little bit of the next segment, but when I talked at the end of the last segment about the police state, we think of a police state as troops in black uniforms, ski masks, checkpoints, surveillance.
[02:11:02.532 --> 02:11:03.692]  And that's part of a police state.
[02:11:04.913 --> 02:11:08.074]  But the real heart of a police state is selective enforcement.
[02:11:10.549 --> 02:11:16.014]  Where when you get robbed, or you get raped, or you get abused, they don't come or they don't do anything.
[02:11:16.374 --> 02:11:18.195]  But when you're part of the establishment, you're defended.
[02:11:19.777 --> 02:11:21.118]  Unfair weights and balances.
[02:11:22.719 --> 02:11:26.222]  And the governor, J.B.
[02:11:26.282 --> 02:11:30.405]  Pritzker, signed this, and now it's going into effect.
[02:11:32.047 --> 02:11:37.671]  The 2021 Safety Act, ICJIA, roles and responsibilities.
[02:11:37.691 --> 02:11:38.472]  Here's the legislation.
[02:11:41.249 --> 02:11:46.473]  And here it is in the local newspaper talking about what it does.
[02:11:46.533 --> 02:11:48.274]  You can go read the bill, that's what it does.
[02:11:48.955 --> 02:11:51.437]  Non-detainable offenses under the Safety Act.
[02:11:52.758 --> 02:12:03.246]  Now you've seen the thousands of Soros elected individuals that he's put in as district attorneys and county attorneys let loose people the day after they shoot people.
[02:12:04.051 --> 02:12:04.832]  If they're a minority.
[02:12:05.252 --> 02:12:06.573]  It's not about empowering minorities.
[02:12:07.273 --> 02:12:11.797]  It's about trying to use out-of-control gangs as a weapon to bring the country down.
[02:12:12.517 --> 02:12:17.961]  Just like you're dissolving the currency, the borders, shipping in fentanyl, pushing hopelessness.
[02:12:19.503 --> 02:12:20.904]  This is true weaponization.
[02:12:22.185 --> 02:12:37.915]   So the following crimes will become non-detainable offenses after the Safety Act goes into effect, which is now happening, meaning that criminals will be allowed To be charged with and released for the crimes without bail.
[02:12:39.395 --> 02:12:45.138]  This happens right here in Austin because we have a literal communist that George Soros put $800,000 in to get elected.
[02:12:45.858 --> 02:12:48.800]  Second-degree murder, out of the jail within 24 hours.
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:50.660]  Drug-related homicide.
[02:12:51.521 --> 02:12:51.801]  Murder.
[02:12:53.081 --> 02:12:53.522]  Arson.
[02:12:53.622 --> 02:12:54.722]  Oh, burn people's houses down.
[02:12:55.162 --> 02:12:56.623]  They're trying to tell their people do what you want.
[02:12:57.250 --> 02:12:58.691]  Because it's going to be their people they let out.
[02:12:58.731 --> 02:13:01.974]  If you're Alex Jones and you just question a shooting, you're the worst guy in the world.
[02:13:01.994 --> 02:13:03.975]  But if you're burning down buildings and shooting people, it's okay.
[02:13:04.476 --> 02:13:07.298]  Kidnapping, which we see exploding around the country.
[02:13:07.718 --> 02:13:08.399]  Burglary.
[02:13:08.859 --> 02:13:09.439]  Robbery.
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:11.101]  Intimidation.
[02:13:11.701 --> 02:13:13.783]  Aggravated DWI means you ran over somebody.
[02:13:14.283 --> 02:13:15.704]  Aggravated fleeing and eluding.
[02:13:16.145 --> 02:13:16.965]  Drug offenses.
[02:13:17.025 --> 02:13:18.246]  Threatening a public official.
[02:13:20.908 --> 02:13:24.231]  But it's all to be selectively enforced.
[02:13:26.491 --> 02:13:29.332]  Second-degree murder, drug-induced homicide, arson.
[02:13:31.793 --> 02:13:32.473]  That's the purge.
[02:13:34.654 --> 02:13:37.055]  And that's what the system is doing.
[02:13:39.356 --> 02:13:42.478]  It's not that the police are perfect, but they're still under local jurisdictions.
[02:13:43.018 --> 02:14:04.388]   But the feds come in because in a city of millions of people, an innocent black man gets killed, which is terrible, but they use that as the pretext Then come in and take it over, and then the City Council gets bodyguards, they defund half the police, the bureaucracy steals that money, and then what's left is their people.
[02:14:04.948 --> 02:14:08.952]  That's why they do forced inoculations, the military and police, to get rid of the good people.
[02:14:10.693 --> 02:14:16.298]  And then once they've gotten rid of them, just like I showed earlier, the federal agencies have a waiver, oh, you don't have to take it anymore.
[02:14:19.414 --> 02:14:23.255]  You've got to get in the mindset of these criminals and realize how incredible this is.
[02:14:23.275 --> 02:14:24.075]  Remember a few years ago?
[02:14:24.095 --> 02:14:39.378]  Minneapolis, Minnesota defunded half the police and then did some giant contract for 24-hour surveillance and security on the homes and businesses of city council members.
[02:14:39.758 --> 02:14:44.399]  So they're marching around with at least three bodyguards 24 hours a day.
[02:14:44.419 --> 02:14:45.399]  Will they lie down at night?
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:46.740]  Or they watch Netflix?
[02:14:47.020 --> 02:14:47.740]  Or they cook dinner?
[02:14:50.486 --> 02:14:57.293]  There's at least one person at their house, usually three, and a driver drives them to work with a gun.
[02:14:58.113 --> 02:15:04.800]  But they want to take your right to a gun to protect yourself away while they take the police away so the criminals can run rampant.
[02:15:06.172 --> 02:15:23.963]  This is almost as absurd as men and women's sports, or drag queen pedophile time, or open borders and human smuggling, or devaluation of the currency, or everything you're seeing is a criminal revolution incrementally to see what you'll put up with, to see what you'll go along with.
[02:15:27.666 --> 02:15:38.229]   And the blueprint you see in Illinois With the non-detainable offenses under the SAFE-T Act is what's coming to your town unless you wake up and see what this is.
[02:15:38.249 --> 02:15:38.949]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:40.050 --> 02:15:42.832]  Brandon, we're now into hour number four.
[02:15:43.272 --> 02:15:44.453]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:15:45.314 --> 02:15:46.254]  Very blessed to be here.
[02:15:46.274 --> 02:15:51.678]  In a few minutes, Jason Bermas, documentary filmmaker and talk show host, is about to take over.
[02:15:51.698 --> 02:15:54.680]  But I wanted to hit these final stories I didn't get to.
[02:15:54.740 --> 02:16:04.983]   Now, a lot of people tune in here and they say, hey, are we tuning into Sean Hannity or Everybody else are talking about the Mar-a-Lago raid, the Mar-a-Lago raid, the Mar-a-Lago raid, the Mar-a-Lago raid, and that's all they talk about.
[02:16:05.023 --> 02:16:05.784]  We don't talk about that.
[02:16:05.804 --> 02:16:11.446]  We talk about the Great Reset, world government, the globalists coming after your guns.
[02:16:11.466 --> 02:16:13.767]  You know, we talk about the energy being cut off.
[02:16:13.847 --> 02:16:14.727]  Those are the big things.
[02:16:14.807 --> 02:16:16.548]  Yeah, the raid on Trump's wrong.
[02:16:17.328 --> 02:16:18.789]  Yeah, he didn't violate the law.
[02:16:18.869 --> 02:16:19.609]  Yeah, it's all true.
[02:16:21.024 --> 02:16:25.407]  And yeah, Trump got good justices put in that got Roe v. Wade turned over.
[02:16:25.468 --> 02:16:27.949]  So I still, in the balance, think Trump is good.
[02:16:28.630 --> 02:16:31.212]  But at the end of the day, he's promoting these poison vaccines.
[02:16:31.272 --> 02:16:37.277]  So the only reason I'm against what's happening to Trump is because it can be done to all of us, and even if a guilty man goes to jail.
[02:16:39.170 --> 02:16:40.952]  It's wrong if an innocent man goes to jail.
[02:16:41.212 --> 02:16:45.677]  You know the old saying, better the ten guilty men go free, one innocent man go to jail.
[02:16:45.697 --> 02:16:47.438]  Because once you get rid of due process, it's over.
[02:16:47.659 --> 02:16:48.700]  But Trump's not guilty of this.
[02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:51.743]  But remember, the White House said, we're not involved.
[02:16:51.843 --> 02:16:53.244]  Well, the judge saw the warrant.
[02:16:53.725 --> 02:16:54.726]  The judge saw it all.
[02:16:55.066 --> 02:16:56.027]  Saw he was being lied to.
[02:16:56.567 --> 02:16:57.568]  Now they're threatening the judge.
[02:16:59.370 --> 02:17:01.933]  And said, it's clear that Biden ordered the raid.
[02:17:05.026 --> 02:17:06.106]  Yeah, he got lied to again.
[02:17:06.126 --> 02:17:11.568]  Of course, these are lying criminals that have blood-red screens with troops behind them, threatening everyone.
[02:17:12.468 --> 02:17:13.549]  They want to be tyrants.
[02:17:13.609 --> 02:17:15.089]  They think that's how they win.
[02:17:15.149 --> 02:17:16.169]  It's all they can do.
[02:17:17.850 --> 02:17:18.450]  Bombshell!
[02:17:18.490 --> 02:17:21.611]  Joe Biden ordered Mar-a-Lago raid court docs show.
[02:17:21.751 --> 02:17:25.152]  BigInfoWars.com article by Jamie White, the most extensive out there.
[02:17:26.292 --> 02:17:31.534]  Special master order reveals Biden's direct involvement in Trump raid and six other bombshells.
[02:17:33.962 --> 02:17:34.502]  Boom!
[02:17:34.963 --> 02:17:40.566]  Federal judge reveals incumbent President Joe Biden ordered FBI access to Mar-a-Lago documents.
[02:17:40.606 --> 02:17:41.166]  Of course he did.
[02:17:41.446 --> 02:17:42.207]  It's in the documents.
[02:17:42.547 --> 02:17:44.808]  No wonder they didn't want it released what was in the warrant.
[02:17:45.849 --> 02:17:48.270]  But again, they thought they could just lie like that.
[02:17:49.971 --> 02:17:54.014]  Judge reveals Biden ordered FBI access to Trump's Mar-a-Lago docs.
[02:17:55.315 --> 02:17:57.776]  Judge halts FBI use of Mar-a-Lago arrayed docs.
[02:17:58.136 --> 02:17:59.157]  Appoints special counsel.
[02:18:00.518 --> 02:18:03.760]  More evidence revealed that Biden's involved in an FBI action against Trump.
[02:18:06.762 --> 02:18:10.564]  Meanwhile, in Canada, manhunt continues for two suspects.
[02:18:11.325 --> 02:18:14.187]  Now it's saying over 10 dead, 15 hospitalized.
[02:18:14.507 --> 02:18:16.388]  But it's not a big news story because it's a knife.
[02:18:17.449 --> 02:18:19.250]  What in the hell's going on there?
[02:18:20.090 --> 02:18:20.891]  Then we've got this.
[02:18:21.411 --> 02:18:23.653]  Mexicans are fed up with Americans moving to their cities.
[02:18:25.014 --> 02:18:27.055]  They're fed up with poor Americans going there.
[02:18:28.803 --> 02:18:31.285]  They don't mind if your middle class are wealthy, just like we don't either.
[02:18:31.745 --> 02:18:35.967]  Nobody wants a bunch of homeless people to come to their town, because who takes care of them?
[02:18:36.928 --> 02:18:41.851]  So Mexico's getting some of its own medicine now, because they're better off than Central and South America.
[02:18:41.911 --> 02:18:49.115]  They're the richest country now in the southern area, and they're discovering what it's like in a collapsed society.
[02:18:50.296 --> 02:18:51.297]  Absolutely crazy.
[02:18:52.185 --> 02:18:52.825]  Another report.
[02:18:52.965 --> 02:18:57.547]  Eight migrants drown in swollen river as death toll from Biden's open border soars.
[02:18:57.907 --> 02:18:59.187]  Thousands of dead total.
[02:18:59.587 --> 02:18:59.848]  Raped.
[02:19:00.228 --> 02:19:00.568]  Murdered.
[02:19:00.648 --> 02:19:00.948]  Killed.
[02:19:01.288 --> 02:19:03.149]  But what's the distraction from MSNBC?
[02:19:03.469 --> 02:19:06.790]  Declares all Republicans evil and a threat to democracy.
[02:19:09.795 --> 02:19:14.860]  Total cuckoo land, as 40% of black students can't go back to school in D.C.
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:16.722]  because they won't take the deadly shot.
[02:19:17.062 --> 02:19:18.123]  Does this guy care about that?
[02:19:18.143 --> 02:19:22.668]  No, he just goes up there and race baits and gets his big fat paycheck.
[02:19:24.289 --> 02:19:26.392]  All right, Jason Burmas is about to take over.
[02:19:27.373 --> 02:19:32.458]  Owen Troyer takes over in about 50 minutes with the War Room, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:19:33.826 --> 02:19:35.107]  It isn't bragging, it's just fact.
[02:19:35.167 --> 02:19:36.307]  This is the tip of the spear.
[02:19:36.347 --> 02:19:37.528]  This is what they want to shut down.
[02:19:37.568 --> 02:19:38.549]  This is what panics them.
[02:19:38.869 --> 02:19:39.789]  This is what they want to stop.
[02:19:40.970 --> 02:19:41.911]  They're not going to stop us.
[02:19:43.131 --> 02:19:44.972]  I've explained this, but even Kru keeps asking me this.
[02:19:45.012 --> 02:19:46.413]  I'll say it in a couple minutes to go to Burma's.
[02:19:48.714 --> 02:20:04.324]   Chapter 5 bankruptcy allows a company to keep its employees and its operations going if it pledges for five years its future profit Which I don't give a damn about.
[02:20:04.344 --> 02:20:06.205]  I've always put 98% into this.
[02:20:07.526 --> 02:20:11.648]  I care about free speech to the Democratic Party law firms and all of them.
[02:20:12.829 --> 02:20:14.630]  They've said in court, their goals shut us down.
[02:20:14.850 --> 02:20:17.951]  They went in bankruptcy court two weeks ago and said, we don't want money.
[02:20:17.991 --> 02:20:18.712]  We want to shut down.
[02:20:18.752 --> 02:20:19.772]  The judge said, screw that.
[02:20:19.892 --> 02:20:22.174]  I mean, they've really jumped the shark here.
[02:20:22.434 --> 02:20:23.474]  They don't own every court.
[02:20:23.875 --> 02:20:36.617]   They don't own this judge saying, no, you're not Presidents can have their papers, and I'm appointing a special master, and you lied on your arrest warrant or your search warrant.
[02:20:38.098 --> 02:20:41.002]  Evil isn't in full control yet, just like Roe v. Wade got overturned.
[02:20:42.343 --> 02:20:46.027]  And so we're at such a crossroads right now, and we need your support.
[02:20:46.087 --> 02:20:47.689]  So go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:20:48.686 --> 02:20:51.928]  We have a plan to stay on air, but we've got to be profitable, which we've not been.
[02:20:52.269 --> 02:20:53.269]  We're starting to get there.
[02:20:53.690 --> 02:20:56.732]  The only way we get shut down in Chapter 5 is, is there's not enough money.
[02:20:57.453 --> 02:21:03.417]  And thanks to you buying products, NymphoWrestler.com, this thing and the 13-week plan is over in like 7 weeks.
[02:21:04.458 --> 02:21:07.680]  And then there's a set number and we go forward, and I don't get paid!
[02:21:09.061 --> 02:21:11.423]  And we stay on air, and they can piss up a rope!
[02:21:11.743 --> 02:21:13.685]  They are crapping their britches, baby!
[02:21:15.580 --> 02:21:16.901]  You saw him in the closing arguments.
[02:21:16.941 --> 02:21:17.862]  We want him shut down.
[02:21:17.882 --> 02:21:19.082]  We want his platform taken.
[02:21:19.343 --> 02:21:20.263]  We want him taken off air.
[02:21:20.583 --> 02:21:21.724]  I'm not like you, Mercs.
[02:21:22.505 --> 02:21:23.445]  I'll die for this.
[02:21:23.986 --> 02:21:26.007]  Gettin' paid for it's just gravy, bitch!
[02:21:27.008 --> 02:21:35.173]  So, InfoWarsTore.com, DNA Force Plus, Body's Ultimate Tumor Formula, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, all 50 to 40% off.
[02:21:35.493 --> 02:21:36.494]  It ends today.
[02:21:36.534 --> 02:21:37.375]  They're selling out.
[02:21:37.875 --> 02:21:39.376]  So, we're gonna put them back to full price.
[02:21:39.396 --> 02:21:40.437]  A little more comes in a few months.
[02:21:40.797 --> 02:21:42.538]  Our biggest problem has been supply chain issues.
[02:21:42.778 --> 02:21:43.759]  But finally, these products are back.
[02:21:44.219 --> 02:21:45.400]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:21:45.740 --> 02:21:46.801]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:21:47.182 --> 02:21:48.843]  It's all there and thank you for your support.
[02:21:49.063 --> 02:21:52.866]  We're going to stay on air, but we are in your hands and I will never back down.
[02:21:53.147 --> 02:21:54.148]  I will never surrender.
[02:21:54.268 --> 02:21:58.371]  I will never falter a waiver if I have your support, but I could give out if I don't have it.
[02:21:58.391 --> 02:21:59.552]  So I am in your hands.
[02:21:59.912 --> 02:22:00.833]  You are in my hands.
[02:22:01.194 --> 02:22:01.954]  We need funding.
[02:22:02.254 --> 02:22:03.896]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:22:04.076 --> 02:22:04.636]  And I thank you.
[02:22:04.837 --> 02:22:06.318]  Jason Burmess has got a full show.
[02:22:06.598 --> 02:22:07.439]  Take it over, Jason.
[02:22:08.826 --> 02:22:19.258]  Thank you Alex Jones and in the next hour we are going to show you how the transgender movement is really about transhumanism.
[02:22:19.278 --> 02:22:43.821]   We're going to talk about a specific individual called Martine Rothblatt that actually authored the book From transgender to transhumanism, a manifesto, this is the person who is the CEO of United Therapeutics, into the Human Genome Project, has started their own religion, Terrasim, and of course, is transgender themselves.
[02:22:44.481 --> 02:22:44.761]  All right?
[02:22:44.961 --> 02:22:47.283]  The agenda is right in front of us.
[02:22:47.383 --> 02:22:54.766]  But first, I want to take it back to what transhumanism really means to different classes of people.
[02:22:54.806 --> 02:23:14.433]   For instance, the predator class believes that they will utilize the biomedical technology to essentially have a fountain of youth where they live forever within these types of physical bodies that are then extended By the technology now for you and I
[02:23:15.231 --> 02:23:39.905]  It is about fooling us into believing we need to augment our bodies, stop having families, and prepare to upload our consciousness into a false virtual reality as we actually manufacture the AI doppelgangers that they will say have cyber consciousness and their own set of rights.
[02:23:40.346 --> 02:23:58.862]   So to begin to make that point, I want to play this video recently of Jared Kushner openly discussing how his generation may be the first generation that lives forever or the last generation that naturally dies.
[02:24:02.859 --> 02:24:09.503]  From, you know, the last year, the one thing I've tried to put a priority on since I left the White House was, you know, getting some exercise in.
[02:24:09.543 --> 02:24:18.988]  I think that there's a good probability that my generation is, hopefully with the advances in science, either, you know, the first generation to live forever or the last generation that's going to die.
[02:24:19.048 --> 02:24:22.029]  And so we need to keep ourselves in pretty good shape.
[02:24:22.610 --> 02:24:27.933]  And then the other thing I'd like... So, right there, that's for them.
[02:24:28.113 --> 02:24:30.474]  That is not for you and I.
[02:24:31.172 --> 02:24:33.854]  You and I get the great reset.
[02:24:33.915 --> 02:24:35.856]  We get the great narrative.
[02:24:35.936 --> 02:25:02.714]   We get a thing called sustainability and productivity improvement, which are code words for your standard of living plummeting, you being put on a universal basic income, As you prepare to be again virtually uploaded, not really, that's the promise, virtually uploaded into their next level metaverse.
[02:25:02.734 --> 02:25:04.395]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:04.495 --> 02:25:06.376]  Alex Jones needs your support.
[02:25:06.676 --> 02:25:09.817]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now.
[02:25:09.877 --> 02:25:17.400]  Get a bunch of the great products, but especially get The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:19.041]  It is so important to push that book.
[02:25:19.461 --> 02:25:20.522]  To number one.
[02:25:20.542 --> 02:25:23.423]  We'll be back on the other side talking transhumanism.
[02:25:24.383 --> 02:25:25.184]  We are back.
[02:25:25.224 --> 02:25:26.945]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:27.045 --> 02:25:32.447]  I am Jason Bermas and we are talking from transgender to transhumanism.
[02:25:33.028 --> 02:25:34.208]  And yes, we're going to show you the book.
[02:25:34.228 --> 02:25:35.989]  We're going to show you the manifesto.
[02:25:36.009 --> 02:25:38.270]  We're going to show you Rothblatt themselves.
[02:25:38.650 --> 02:25:45.914]  But first, I want to take it back to where Alex was talking about this agenda of command and control.
[02:25:46.534 --> 02:25:51.558]  And I often show people Dennis Bushnell, who's the chief scientist at NASA.
[02:25:51.598 --> 02:25:54.079]  Guys, it's not about going to the moon or Mars.
[02:25:54.299 --> 02:26:03.446]  I mean, they just had to cancel Artemis, where they had dummies and Snoopy on it because of first, oh, lightning storms and now fuel leaks.
[02:26:03.666 --> 02:26:08.769]  We're very limited on what rocket technology can actually do other than weaponize space, by the way.
[02:26:09.089 --> 02:26:20.496]   However, what they're really about is transhumanism, full-spectrum dominance, and working with organizations like DARPA to bring in this technology.
[02:26:20.516 --> 02:26:23.018]  Now, Bushnell's still the chief scientist over there.
[02:26:23.219 --> 02:26:24.840]  He's been around since the Gemini days.
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:30.945]  We often go to his 2001-2025 Future Strategic Warfare document, which we may show you.
[02:26:31.385 --> 02:26:38.171]  But here he lays it down for you, all the way back in 2011, of what sustainability really means.
[02:26:38.331 --> 02:26:41.012]   It means You're doing too much.
[02:26:41.052 --> 02:26:43.153]  There are too many people on the Earth.
[02:26:43.233 --> 02:26:44.273]  We need to fix that.
[02:26:44.373 --> 02:26:45.813]  It's Malthus 101.
[02:26:46.073 --> 02:26:55.196]  We're going to instigate population control, and then we're going to bring in the robots, which can do anything a human can do, but better.
[02:26:55.296 --> 02:26:56.656]  But don't take my word for it.
[02:26:56.696 --> 02:26:57.556]  Let's listen to Dennis.
[02:26:57.976 --> 02:27:01.477]  Prevention of collapse of the ecosystem has now become the overwhelming issue.
[02:27:03.245 --> 02:27:06.826]  Current food production is based on freshwater plants, i.e.
[02:27:06.866 --> 02:27:07.547]  glycophytes.
[02:27:08.107 --> 02:27:11.029]  We're running out of fresh water, as you know.
[02:27:11.129 --> 02:27:12.870]  The code word is sustainability.
[02:27:14.951 --> 02:27:22.455]  The crashing of the ecosystem is due to population growth and the way we're now living, our standard of living.
[02:27:23.415 --> 02:27:38.886]  The estimates vary between 30 and 50 percent of a planet that we're currently short to sustain the standard of living and the current population, much less the population growth.
[02:27:39.387 --> 02:27:40.728]  Now, again, think about this.
[02:27:41.248 --> 02:27:42.589]  This is over a decade ago.
[02:27:43.309 --> 02:27:47.592]  So the current population, population is always the problem.
[02:27:47.632 --> 02:27:49.834]  The people are always the problem.
[02:27:51.059 --> 02:27:59.788]  As the Asians and their billions come up as they are at 9-11% growth rate to Western standards of living, we're going to be short 3 more planets.
[02:28:00.248 --> 02:28:01.630]  And they're not readily available.
[02:28:02.450 --> 02:28:04.793]  This will result in peak everything.
[02:28:05.614 --> 02:28:08.537]  This will result in standards of living plunging.
[02:28:09.443 --> 02:28:11.244]  So this is Malthus 101.
[02:28:11.605 --> 02:28:12.725]  Malthusianism?
[02:28:13.226 --> 02:28:15.087]  Your standard of living plummeting?
[02:28:15.447 --> 02:28:18.109]  Get ready, the growth business is over.
[02:28:18.510 --> 02:28:25.895]  This is command and control and now you're going to find out productivity improvement is really about automation and robotization.
[02:28:26.685 --> 02:28:34.286]   These innate ecosystem restrictions and shortfalls will necessarily shift world econometrics
[02:28:34.286 --> 02:28:41.325]   from a growth mantra in one of sustainability, with possible population control instigated along
[02:28:41.325 --> 02:28:47.244]   the way that changes everything. You know, they're just going to instigate that population control,
[02:28:47.244 --> 02:28:55.165]   and you could do that biomedically, but also the psychological warfare aspect of the trans
[02:28:55.165 --> 02:29:02.444]   movement and telling people that they are fluid, that they are zeros and ones, they're non-binary.
[02:29:03.117 --> 02:29:04.739]  They can take any form they like.
[02:29:05.419 --> 02:29:07.801]  That lie is at the essence of that.
[02:29:10.129 --> 02:29:16.015]  In terms of employment, just as an example, we are in a jobless economic recovery.
[02:29:16.055 --> 02:29:18.458]  There's about 7 million jobs missing.
[02:29:19.439 --> 02:29:21.581]  Some of them were globalized and offshore.
[02:29:22.121 --> 02:29:23.763]  The rest of them are gone.
[02:29:24.444 --> 02:29:31.771]  The code word is productivity improvement, which is a code word for ever better automation and robotization.
[02:29:33.177 --> 02:29:50.203]  If you look at the way the robots are going, human-level machine intelligence from the IBM Brain Project is now about 10 to 15 years up, via biomimetics, where they've nanosectioned the neocortex and they're replicating in silicon, okay?
[02:29:50.243 --> 02:29:53.084]  And they're having great success in all of this.
[02:29:53.124 --> 02:29:56.906]  So this is not soft computing, this is via biomimetics.
[02:29:58.644 --> 02:30:05.738]  We have looked 20-30 years out with the way robotics and automation and machine intelligence... 20-30 years out at this point is 2030-2040, folks!
[02:30:07.975 --> 02:30:09.216]  You see how that's funny?
[02:30:09.236 --> 02:30:11.578]  But that's really what it's about.
[02:30:11.518 --> 02:30:17.677]   do? The answer is no. We thought we need human touch wiping in nursing homes for a while,
[02:30:17.677 --> 02:30:22.237]   but the Japanese two years ago put robots in nursing homes and patients like them much better than the humans.
[02:30:22.237 --> 02:30:27.727]  You see how that's funny? But that's really what it's about.
[02:30:27.727 --> 02:30:34.727]   Also, it's about taking control of the medical system, of the school systems, bringing in
[02:30:34.727 --> 02:30:37.118]  AI, bringing in globalism.
[02:30:37.335 --> 02:30:47.819]  It's funny then, but really part of their command and control is something like this, which we saw during the COVID 1984 nightmare over in Australia.
[02:30:48.499 --> 02:30:49.460]  And that was what?
[02:30:50.780 --> 02:30:54.862]  Oh, Grace, which is the AI bot Sophia's cousin.
[02:30:54.902 --> 02:30:59.984]  Remember, they're eventually going to convince you this type of technology has consciousness and rights.
[02:31:00.834 --> 02:31:02.976]  All right, and this is going to run on the blockchain.
[02:31:04.378 --> 02:31:12.106]  Software does what you tell software to do, so when you put it into a robot, there is no human empathy.
[02:31:12.326 --> 02:31:16.210]  It is extremely, extremely dangerous.
[02:31:17.332 --> 02:31:24.191]   Now, I want to jump to a clip here of this Well, I'm going to let you see it for yourself.
[02:31:24.471 --> 02:31:28.736]  It is just a segment from the Transformers Conference from May 18, 2016.
[02:31:29.637 --> 02:31:31.179]  And guess what?
[02:31:31.739 --> 02:31:38.227]  Mr. Bezos, who's part of that transhumanist crew like Kushner that thinks that they're going to empower themselves and live forever, right?
[02:31:38.767 --> 02:31:48.153]  The Washington Post, along with Lockheed Martin and Samsung, put together this conference called Transformers that starts with Martine Rothblatt.
[02:31:48.333 --> 02:31:55.257]  But we're going to show you somebody who's already transformed themselves with a device that can see, hear, feel colors.
[02:31:55.357 --> 02:31:56.597]  It's an extra sense.
[02:31:57.078 --> 02:32:00.420]  And he even talks about it in relation to what?
[02:32:00.820 --> 02:32:05.903]  The underground transhuman or transgender movement of the past.
[02:32:06.463 --> 02:32:07.864]  ...have, but that humans don't have.
[02:32:07.924 --> 02:32:12.327]  So, we are in a staging history that we can actually design what species we want to be.
[02:32:12.708 --> 02:32:17.651]  I consider myself a trans species, because I'm adding senses and organs that other species have.
[02:32:18.092 --> 02:32:22.335]  And you can add many, many more senses that other species have, and organs that other species have.
[02:32:22.715 --> 02:32:26.478]  And we'll start seeing this in the 20s, because it's now growing, it's happening underground.
[02:32:26.518 --> 02:32:35.204]  There's already many surgeons that are willing to do the surgery anonymously, in the same way that in the 50s and 60s, transgender operations were being done a bit underground.
[02:32:35.504 --> 02:32:52.710]  Now, cyborg surgeries are being done a bit underground, but in the end, bioethical committees will also accept that cyborg surgeries should be allowed for everyone that wants to extend their perception of reality, at least to the level of... So again, these bioethics committees are going to decide, and guess what?
[02:32:53.283 --> 02:33:00.809]  The World Health Organization, along with the United Nations, has now just magically decided that sex is not limited to male or female.
[02:33:00.849 --> 02:33:01.590]  This is the new thing.
[02:33:01.610 --> 02:33:10.917]  And remember, the World Health Organization took charge of what the narratives could be on large social media platforms, including YouTube and Google.
[02:33:11.117 --> 02:33:20.525]  In fact, you go to their own sites, gender and health, you go to their own propaganda, and now it is health for peace and peace for health.
[02:33:21.218 --> 02:33:26.079]  With a transgender Mother Earth who has a mustache holding the Dove of Peace.
[02:33:26.420 --> 02:33:29.881]  Meanwhile, you see windmills, recycling symbols on there.
[02:33:30.261 --> 02:33:33.242]  Because this is about command and control.
[02:33:33.262 --> 02:33:37.783]  When we come back, we're going to play more from the Transformers Conference.
[02:33:38.536 --> 02:33:47.502]  We're going to go to the author of From Transgender to Transhumanism, A Manifesto, and we're going to let that person speak for themselves.
[02:33:47.682 --> 02:33:48.483]  I am Jason Bermas.
[02:33:48.763 --> 02:33:51.525]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:51.605 --> 02:33:55.468]  Do what you can right now to support Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[02:33:55.488 --> 02:33:57.489]  If you can give a straight donation, great.
[02:33:57.669 --> 02:34:00.411]  If you can go buy The Great Reset and The War for World, great.
[02:34:00.451 --> 02:34:06.956]  If you can go to InfoWarsStore.com and make a purchase, even better, we'll be back with more info on the flip.
[02:34:07.896 --> 02:34:08.817]  We are back.
[02:34:08.857 --> 02:34:10.878]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:10.898 --> 02:34:17.563]  I'm Jason Bermas, and it is time to go from transgender to transhuman.
[02:34:17.904 --> 02:34:27.211]  Now, it cannot be overstated how powerful this person is, and we'll look at some of the other works of literature that they've put out there.
[02:34:27.871 --> 02:34:31.114]  This is a person who is heavily into eugenics.
[02:34:31.134 --> 02:34:35.357]  This is a person that has founded their own religion.
[02:34:35.954 --> 02:34:38.636]  Okay, it is the TerraSem Movement.
[02:34:38.676 --> 02:34:43.579]  This is a person that is at the height of what xenotransplantation is.
[02:34:43.959 --> 02:34:46.180]  And they'll later talk about social Darwinism.
[02:34:47.081 --> 02:34:49.302]  And essentially, I want to put this out there again.
[02:34:49.923 --> 02:34:54.105]  They're going to tell you that this technology is going to empower you, it's going to enslave you.
[02:34:54.225 --> 02:35:05.309]   Meanwhile, they intend to test Test the actual technology that could empower humanity that they intend to use for themselves.
[02:35:05.749 --> 02:35:18.038]  And when we get to Rothblatt being talked to, number one, they are the first person to be talked to at the Transformers conference, put on by the Post and the good people at Lockheed Martin.
[02:35:18.058 --> 02:35:24.482]  Remember, Bezos is one of those people that believes he's going to empower himself with this technology.
[02:35:24.943 --> 02:35:33.853]   The first thing they mention Is the law in North Carolina that was passed to keep transgender people in the correct bathrooms.
[02:35:34.334 --> 02:35:36.137]  And now how that is bigoted.
[02:35:36.177 --> 02:35:39.763]  Remember this is a manifesto this person has written about the freedom of form.
[02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:57.940]  And has heavily invested in this movement to take us from transgender to transhuman because they want you to believe there is no biology and that the traditional family and any idea of a deity out there doesn't exist.
[02:35:58.540 --> 02:35:59.722]  It doesn't exist at all.
[02:36:00.142 --> 02:36:01.564]  So let's play this clip.
[02:36:02.766 --> 02:36:19.742]  ...is also the recipient of this year's Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative Award, which is devoted to LBGT issues, and puts her in an interesting issue because she has a company, or part of the company is based in North Carolina, which, as you know right now, she might get arrested for going to the bathroom.
[02:36:21.083 --> 02:36:22.743]  If the governor had anything to do about it.
[02:36:23.064 --> 02:36:25.184]  And later they'll go back to the bathroom issue.
[02:36:25.224 --> 02:36:35.466]  I did a full watch along with this entire presentation for over an hour and 20 minutes of it because I think it was almost a two-hour broadcast because it is so important.
[02:36:35.726 --> 02:36:40.447]  But again, listen to what this person has to say about transhumanism.
[02:36:41.747 --> 02:36:43.747]  Ladies and gentlemen, Martine Rothblatt.
[02:36:43.747 --> 02:36:50.747]  [Applause]
[02:36:50.747 --> 02:36:53.747]   Martine, one of the basic concepts that you're interested in,
[02:36:53.747 --> 02:36:56.747]  it's not just improving life, but it's actually immortality.
[02:36:57.431 --> 02:36:58.772]  That we're all going to live forever.
[02:36:58.932 --> 02:37:04.416]  And Martin, I might mention, has founded a religion, as one does, known as...
[02:37:05.879 --> 02:37:14.386]  It's based on transhumanism and you have the idea that we're not just going to live a long time but we're all going to live forever.
[02:37:14.406 --> 02:37:17.968]  Tell us your concept of immortality and how that actually would work.
[02:37:18.429 --> 02:37:26.635]  See this is going to be the false immortality that they're going to try to trick you into to get you into the quote-unquote virtual age.
[02:37:27.075 --> 02:37:39.581]   They want to make life on this planet So destructive, so hard, so abhorrent that they want to trick you into this new thing that they're already setting up through the World Economic Forum.
[02:37:40.021 --> 02:37:40.241]  All right.
[02:37:40.281 --> 02:37:45.522]  It is the metaverse and defining and building that with what?
[02:37:46.542 --> 02:37:55.985]  Governance and socio and economic value, all part of the social credit store, all part of the command and control.
[02:37:58.863 --> 02:37:59.764]  Thanks, Nealey.
[02:37:59.924 --> 02:38:01.665]  It's a great pleasure to be here.
[02:38:02.825 --> 02:38:10.449]  The idea is one that has been percolating up from lots of people in the information technology industry for a while.
[02:38:11.470 --> 02:38:18.013]  Perhaps Ray Kurzweil, who is a prolific inventor, is best known for the idea.
[02:38:18.852 --> 02:38:51.429]   That as our abilities in the information processing industry, computer software, storage of more and more of our thoughts and our ideas outside of our body becomes easier, more automatic, less expensive, That ultimately we're going to have sort of digital doppelgangers of ourselves that are stored in the cloud and are able to present themselves to any manner of devices.
[02:38:52.458 --> 02:39:16.423]  And that as thousands and thousands of software coders and hackers and people in the maker movement work to make the software that runs these digital doppelgangers ever more lifelike, ever more human-like, there'll come sort of a tipping point when people begin to claim that these digital doppelgangers have achieved what we call consciousness.
[02:39:17.023 --> 02:39:27.742]  And remember, we already have that Google whistleblower, who actually happens to be into Chaos Magic and Crowley, alright, saying that the AI, they're working now.
[02:39:28.567 --> 02:39:29.868]  at Google is sentient.
[02:39:30.188 --> 02:39:30.529]  All right?
[02:39:30.809 --> 02:39:31.909]  And none of it is sentient.
[02:39:32.030 --> 02:39:33.190]  It is all programs.
[02:39:33.230 --> 02:39:34.912]  It is all zeros and ones.
[02:39:35.492 --> 02:39:36.553]  It is all false.
[02:39:36.893 --> 02:39:42.137]  But it is there to trick you so that they can give it rights through laws and lawyers.
[02:39:42.557 --> 02:39:46.940]  And through this, she'll talk about how we're going to treat them as pets, right?
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:49.702]  They're only going to have pets or animal type rights.
[02:39:49.742 --> 02:39:53.845]  That's a total lie to get you absorbed into that.
[02:39:54.720 --> 02:40:22.804]   An ability to have a sense of themselves hopes fears and feelings and at that point I think the Activity will move to the legal arena as to whether or not these digital doppelgangers really are conscious really do have an independent legal identity and kind of the trend of progressive thinking is once there's a scientific consensus and In this case, it would be the science of psychology.
[02:40:22.864 --> 02:40:27.008]  So, in other words, you're going to have to trust the psychological science.
[02:40:27.068 --> 02:40:33.134]  And boy, the science has just changed on gender, too, according to the UN and the World Health Organization.
[02:40:33.154 --> 02:40:41.201]  And I want to point out, you know, the drag part of this, the trans part of that, because, again, that's the science now, is a big deal.
[02:40:41.241 --> 02:40:43.804]  This is at a school at the United Nations.
[02:40:43.844 --> 02:40:46.866]   The United Nations has its own Private school, okay?
[02:40:47.146 --> 02:40:49.928]  And you can look this up, it is Eunice.
[02:40:50.649 --> 02:40:54.732]  And in that school, oh, it's just drag queens everywhere!
[02:40:54.812 --> 02:40:56.453]  It's Proud or the Brave!
[02:40:56.793 --> 02:40:58.394]  This is a great school.
[02:40:58.714 --> 02:41:00.155]  I got sent this from a friend.
[02:41:00.556 --> 02:41:03.598]  I'm not gonna tell you what friend or how, but an insider.
[02:41:04.438 --> 02:41:08.161]  And now the science is they're gonna let you know the most gay-friendly countries.
[02:41:08.381 --> 02:41:12.604]  When you really get down to it, over here you see Sustainable Development Goals.
[02:41:13.547 --> 02:41:13.767]  Right?
[02:41:13.807 --> 02:41:17.229]  And you see the same things again and again all over.
[02:41:17.469 --> 02:41:18.369]  Take a look at this one.
[02:41:18.669 --> 02:41:20.150]  This is where you see some real charts.
[02:41:20.250 --> 02:41:26.893]  I mean, look at the definitive information that they're putting out there to push transgenderism.
[02:41:27.373 --> 02:41:29.074]  And the progressive thinking is under what?
[02:41:29.354 --> 02:41:32.475]  The science we must all trust about psychology.
[02:41:32.675 --> 02:41:40.639]  You know, the same psychology scientists that gave us SSRI drugs that have been so helpful in society.
[02:41:41.235 --> 02:41:48.539]  ...being the science of the mind, that these digital doppelgangers are in fact cyber-conscious.
[02:41:49.680 --> 02:42:04.468]  Then they'll begin to acquire the sorts of rights and protections that we assign to even our pets, laboratory animals, and to quite a high extent to primates like chimpanzees.
[02:42:05.108 --> 02:42:11.267]   So there you go, this is the incrementalization of this program.
[02:42:12.388 --> 02:42:13.609]  Small Steps.
[02:42:13.669 --> 02:42:16.972]  Again, from Transgender to Transhuman.
[02:42:17.533 --> 02:42:20.535]  And this person's written several other books, including what?
[02:42:20.956 --> 02:42:22.117]  Unzipped Genes.
[02:42:23.238 --> 02:42:24.359]  Unzipped Genes.
[02:42:24.439 --> 02:42:25.199]  Take a look, folks.
[02:42:25.259 --> 02:42:25.960]  It's right here.
[02:42:26.621 --> 02:42:30.444]  So, they're telling you that biomedical... This is from 97.
[02:42:30.964 --> 02:42:33.827]  The Transgender to Transhuman is 2011.
[02:42:36.832 --> 02:42:41.840]  They're telling you that you're going to live in a virtual universe.
[02:42:41.860 --> 02:42:44.283]  There's going to be digital doppelgangers.
[02:42:44.824 --> 02:42:46.126]  They're going to have rights.
[02:42:46.427 --> 02:42:47.769]  And she'll make the analogy.
[02:42:48.875 --> 02:43:02.058]  That your aunt can die in a car accident, but they're not really gone because their aunt is going to live through some other cybernetically created organism that's going to have that upload on it.
[02:43:02.478 --> 02:43:03.738]  It is not your consciousness.
[02:43:04.278 --> 02:43:05.338]  It is not your soul.
[02:43:05.699 --> 02:43:06.659]  You are special.
[02:43:06.679 --> 02:43:08.659]  You are not zeros and ones.
[02:43:08.679 --> 02:43:12.200]  There is an agenda against your children right now.
[02:43:13.163 --> 02:43:25.510]  To biologically and psychologically come after them so that they no longer can think straight and are pushed into this agenda of taking away their biological identity.
[02:43:25.530 --> 02:43:44.468]   Okay, and the possibility of them having a family and daring, daring To stand up to this very real post-human future that the Predator class would like to bring in as they extend their life through their fountain of youth technology.
[02:43:44.769 --> 02:43:46.730]  Final segment on the other side.
[02:43:46.770 --> 02:43:47.810]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:48.051 --> 02:43:51.989]   Go support them at InfoWarsTore.com We are back.
[02:43:52.029 --> 02:43:54.892]  It is the final segment of the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:55.052 --> 02:43:56.174]  I am Jason Bermas.
[02:43:56.194 --> 02:44:00.418]  We are talking from transgender to transhumanism.
[02:44:00.859 --> 02:44:10.089]  And in this next segment, Rothblatt will discuss this uploading of a digital doppelganger and this immortality.
[02:44:10.370 --> 02:44:17.435]   Meanwhile, Calico Labs Which is run by Kurzweil, who Rothblatt mentions, right?
[02:44:17.656 --> 02:44:25.501]  They're actually looking for the technology, again, the Fountain of Youth stuff, where the digital doppelganger doesn't need to be uploaded.
[02:44:25.541 --> 02:44:26.822]  But we have to ignore that!
[02:44:27.842 --> 02:44:35.885]  And we just have to trust this person who says it's the best thing since breakfast when they're confronted on the eugenics issue as well.
[02:44:36.485 --> 02:44:42.548]  And I think very quickly we'll get to a point where we say that that cyber-conscious individual has a soul.
[02:44:43.048 --> 02:44:44.068]  It's Neely's soul.
[02:44:44.648 --> 02:44:52.391]  And even if God forbid Neely's body ends in a car accident or some other death and disability, Neely did not end.
[02:44:52.791 --> 02:44:55.973]  Neely's identity continues in this cyber-conscious form.
[02:44:56.433 --> 02:45:01.475]   So again, The cyber consciousness is the equivalent to a soul, a total lie.
[02:45:02.195 --> 02:45:13.219]  Okay, your consciousness, your spirit, your soul, whatever you want to talk, whatever you want to speak about it, whatever you want to call it, that is unique, that is something that they cannot replicate.
[02:45:13.239 --> 02:45:19.342]  They will try to imitate and convince the masses that it is that, but I assure you, it is not.
[02:45:20.367 --> 02:45:26.130]  Let me ask you one more about sort of the frightening aspects of this, because there would be some people that none of us want to live forever.
[02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:28.851]  Hitler, for example.
[02:45:29.471 --> 02:45:32.412]  Nobody wants this guy to be able to upload, right?
[02:45:32.612 --> 02:45:33.813]  See, everybody just kind of chuckles.
[02:45:33.893 --> 02:45:34.793]  Oh, it's so funny!
[02:45:35.634 --> 02:45:39.475]  So where do you get into sort of eugenics was a real thing in this country?
[02:45:39.495 --> 02:45:43.457]  In other words, you know, 20 years, 80 years ago, we're going to... No, you're right.
[02:45:43.497 --> 02:45:44.498]  You go back 20 years.
[02:45:44.538 --> 02:45:46.038]  There's still a lot of programs out there.
[02:45:46.078 --> 02:45:47.839]  Eugenics is a real thing globally now.
[02:45:48.159 --> 02:46:06.807]   And for us not to acknowledge that, You're a nice person to run this project, but how do we avoid digital eugenics and robot cyber people?
[02:46:08.008 --> 02:46:08.929]  Where does that come in?
[02:46:08.969 --> 02:46:10.410]  Who gets to participate in the program?
[02:46:11.571 --> 02:46:18.594]  Yeah, I have the point of view that this is not a realistic thing to really fear.
[02:46:19.055 --> 02:46:20.935]  Again, don't think about it.
[02:46:20.975 --> 02:46:22.316]  Don't fear it.
[02:46:22.596 --> 02:46:23.597]  It's not realistic.
[02:46:23.857 --> 02:46:27.999]  And then she actually talks about Darwinism.
[02:46:28.479 --> 02:46:29.960]  These are social Darwinists.
[02:46:31.240 --> 02:46:32.801]  And there are classes of people.
[02:46:33.421 --> 02:46:34.482]  There's a predator class.
[02:46:34.662 --> 02:46:36.423]  They consider those under them what?
[02:46:36.563 --> 02:46:38.363]  Either they're minions or peasants.
[02:46:38.904 --> 02:46:39.524]  Period.
[02:46:40.276 --> 02:46:43.129]  The technology is not for us to be empowered with.
[02:46:43.570 --> 02:46:51.864]   And again, This person is going to give you this false idea that good always triumphs over evil.
[02:46:51.924 --> 02:46:53.024]  That's not reality.
[02:46:53.044 --> 02:47:08.753]  Because all of this cyber consciousness and all of these robots that are being developed are being developed in an environment, which even though it's a human-made environment, our socioeconomic system, it's still an environment much like the natural environment.
[02:47:08.813 --> 02:47:11.975]  It's just us humans are the selection factors.
[02:47:12.736 --> 02:47:16.100]  And so the laws of Darwinism still apply.
[02:47:16.921 --> 02:47:25.772]  And the so-called bad robot problem, or the Hitler robot problem, there is going to be nobody that wants to buy a Hitler robot.
[02:47:26.904 --> 02:47:38.640]  If a Hitler robot emerges and begins to do bad things, the same thing is going to happen to the Hitler robot that happened to the real Hitler, which is the rest of society is going to rise up and quash it down.
[02:47:39.021 --> 02:47:49.274]   Really, because if you look at technology, especially that is developed for warfare, Often the people can't rise up, hence drone warfare in the Middle East and the War on Terror.
[02:47:49.674 --> 02:47:58.505]  Even what's going on now with the Ukraine and Elon Musk's Starlink and Blackjack satellites that are rigging up to drones that are killing people.
[02:47:59.225 --> 02:48:00.667]  Very unrealistic!
[02:48:01.268 --> 02:48:08.689]   And by the way, I'm going to play Dennis Bushnell in 2018, not only talking about human brain chips, but how what?
[02:48:09.190 --> 02:48:11.772]  We've taken charge of evolution.
[02:48:11.812 --> 02:48:15.275]  The evolution of everything is over.
[02:48:15.695 --> 02:48:19.759]  It's all going to be human driven, Darwin driven.
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:22.682]  Remember, this is a 2016 conference.
[02:48:22.902 --> 02:48:24.103]  The Bushnell clip is from 2018 coming up.
[02:48:26.315 --> 02:48:30.238]  So there's no market really for an evil robot, evil software.
[02:48:30.738 --> 02:48:33.841]  Does that mean that evil robots and software will never exist?
[02:48:33.921 --> 02:48:36.403]  No, I don't think it means that because they already exist.
[02:48:36.923 --> 02:48:42.467]  There's always mutations in the environment and there will be bad people and bad robots that emerge.
[02:48:42.948 --> 02:49:07.004]   But the vast majority of billions of people that comprise all the decision-making in society through their economic powers and their political powers will quash down the bad people and the bad robots And so I think it's a self-correcting problem because humans, overwhelmingly good humans, comprise the Darwinian environment in which all of this cyber consciousness will emerge.
[02:49:07.424 --> 02:49:08.865]  So let's just stop it right there.
[02:49:09.265 --> 02:49:15.068]  Unfortunately, the masses no longer have a lot of economic or political power.
[02:49:15.368 --> 02:49:23.913]  And that's why the great reset and the great narrative are the steps to this transhumanist and eventually virtual age.
[02:49:24.676 --> 02:49:26.818]  So let's play Bushnell Now, telling you.
[02:49:28.138 --> 02:49:30.340]  Humans are now becoming cyborgs.
[02:49:31.381 --> 02:49:43.409]  We have cochlear implants to hear, artificial retinas to see, artificial hearts to live, artificial limbs to move, artificial organs to function, and brain chips.
[02:49:44.198 --> 02:49:52.885]  There's a couple hundred thousand people wandering around with brain chips now to fix congenitally defective brains and increasingly to fix memory and other things.
[02:49:53.325 --> 02:49:56.307]  DARPA's working on brain chips for super soldiers.
[02:49:56.808 --> 02:49:58.889]  And they've been working on them for decades, by the way.
[02:49:59.230 --> 02:50:02.712]  And Elon Musk and others, they just can't wait to invest in this technology.
[02:50:03.053 --> 02:50:05.054]  Neuralink is D.O.D.
[02:50:05.414 --> 02:50:06.495]  DARPA tech.
[02:50:06.876 --> 02:50:07.656]  Grow up.
[02:50:07.896 --> 02:50:25.650]   He's a front for the And people are now working thanks to Musk and other people funding direct machine brain communications.
[02:50:27.792 --> 02:50:31.514]  It's not us versus them, us versus the machines, we're merging.
[02:50:32.455 --> 02:50:35.878]  And this is the human evolution of the humans.
[02:50:36.952 --> 02:50:39.953]  There is no more natural evolution of anything.
[02:50:40.753 --> 02:50:48.416]  People are convinced that the human evolution of everything is 10 million times faster than any natural evolution.
[02:50:49.196 --> 02:50:50.297]  So there it is right there.
[02:50:50.377 --> 02:50:53.058]  He's telling you, we're taking control of evolution.
[02:50:53.558 --> 02:51:04.759]   And in some respects, you almost have to thank Yovel Noah Harari, who did this recent interview With TED Talks, right?
[02:51:04.819 --> 02:51:06.340]  This is the audio collective.
[02:51:06.400 --> 02:51:14.264]  This is an hour long, where he not only tells you the vast majority of the population is not needed for the future of society.
[02:51:14.764 --> 02:51:27.991]  In that interview, he lets you know that one of the reasons there's so much upheaval and disturbance in the world is that psychologically, subconsciously, in the back of most people's heads, they realize they're not part of the future.
[02:51:28.863 --> 02:51:38.585]  They realize the next story, as he calls it, for humanity in general, doesn't involve the majority of the populace.
[02:51:39.045 --> 02:51:42.865]  We've laid it down here in the past hour.
[02:51:43.646 --> 02:51:46.506]  Yeah, they're coming after your kids because they want to destroy the family.
[02:51:46.546 --> 02:51:50.487]  Yeah, they're coming after your kids because they want to sexualize and confuse them.
[02:51:50.527 --> 02:52:19.081]   But ultimately, they want a populace that no longer identifies at all with their own biology, With their family structure, the inherent nature of that, and the inherent nature of us looking above to find out that there is a source, a power out there that grants humanity itself free will to make its own decisions.
[02:52:20.582 --> 02:52:22.922]  And that good and evil actually exist.
[02:52:22.942 --> 02:52:24.583]  They're not just social mores.
[02:52:25.896 --> 02:52:26.196]  All right?
[02:52:26.616 --> 02:52:32.039]  They're not just societal norms, they actually exist, and they want to separate us from all of that.
[02:52:32.779 --> 02:52:45.005]  Meanwhile, they'll take their technology for the Kush-Kush's of the world, and the Peter Thiel's of the world, and the Bezos's of the world, and try to live in this form forever, eternally.
[02:52:45.894 --> 02:53:05.687]  And get us to transmutate our bodies with bio, nanotech, and human brain interfaces that will ultimately enslave us and push us into a metaverse or virtual age where we literally euthanize ourselves and believe that we will live forever.
[02:53:06.208 --> 02:53:12.252]  Folks, if you want to see more of this stuff, in fact, you want to see more of that conference, we did the watch along.
[02:53:13.206 --> 02:53:16.169]  It is the transhumanism more than meets the eye.
[02:53:16.329 --> 02:53:16.950]  Watch along.
[02:53:16.970 --> 02:53:18.832]  You can watch it on all my platforms.
[02:53:18.892 --> 02:53:19.592]  I'm on Rumble.
[02:53:19.993 --> 02:53:20.894]  I'm on Rockfin.
[02:53:21.194 --> 02:53:25.618]  I'm still at YouTube by the skin of my chinny chin chin.
[02:53:26.039 --> 02:53:27.660]  And I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[02:53:27.860 --> 02:53:30.843]  The 9-11 21st anniversary is just around the corner.
[02:53:30.883 --> 02:53:35.967]   I want to remind you that Infowars and Alex Jones They produced Loose Change, Final Cut, and Fabled Enemies.
[02:53:36.187 --> 02:53:39.948]  I want you to watch Invisible Empire in New World Order Defined and shade the motion picture.
[02:53:40.188 --> 02:53:47.730]  And I want you to support Alex Jones and InfoWars.com right now with making that purchase of what?
[02:53:48.150 --> 02:53:51.011]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:53:51.171 --> 02:53:55.613]  Push that mother trucker all the way to number one.
[02:53:55.993 --> 02:54:02.675]  You can support by giving a donation or going to InfoWarsStore.com and getting some of the other great videos out there, including the COVID Land series.
[02:54:03.275 --> 02:54:05.097]  This is the tip of the spear.
[02:54:05.117 --> 02:54:14.849]  I want to personally thank Alex Jones for allowing me the opportunity to reach his audience for an hour on this extremely important issue, because the bottom line is, yeah, I'm about the Constitution.
[02:54:14.889 --> 02:54:16.210]  Yeah, I'm about the Republic.
[02:54:16.591 --> 02:54:20.335]  Yeah, I'm totally about humanity, and this is the battle for it.
[02:54:20.455 --> 02:54:21.496]  I love you guys.
[02:54:21.595 --> 02:54:34.194]  Thanks for joining me, and I'll see you on the flip side.
[02:54:34.194 --> 02:54:44.195]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:54:35.474 --> 02:54:42.100]  It's time for me personally to get my head in the game and realize that yes, we expose the New World Order.
[02:54:42.700 --> 02:54:43.981]  Yes, we expose the globalists.
[02:54:44.929 --> 02:54:48.150]  And so humanity has a fighting chance, but we didn't stop their Great Reset.
[02:54:48.670 --> 02:54:53.271]  We didn't stop the design collapse of the world economy and the world food supply.
[02:54:53.891 --> 02:55:10.175]  It is now inevitable that the days we're living in now, with 47% electricity price increases and Europe paying nine times what they were for natural gas, and with tens of millions starving to death, that what we're seeing now is just the beginning.
[02:55:11.707 --> 02:55:12.648]  We have to get prepared.
[02:55:12.688 --> 02:55:13.468]  We have to get ready.
[02:55:13.988 --> 02:55:22.494]  And, while we personally get prepared and get ready, we've got to be warning the general public so they understand that the globalists engineered the crisis we're now in on record.
[02:55:23.515 --> 02:55:28.738]  I told you two and a half years ago, at the beginning of the lockdowns, it was designed to trigger the supply chain collapse, and now it's done it.
[02:55:28.778 --> 02:55:29.618]  Here's some of the headlines.
[02:55:29.658 --> 02:55:32.220]  This is out of AgriPulse.
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:35.682]  Senators warn food crisis could worsen in 2030.
[02:55:38.619 --> 02:55:44.543]  UN chief warns of catastrophic catastrophe from global food shortage that they implemented.
[02:55:45.844 --> 02:55:47.585]  World hit by unprecedented hunger crisis.
[02:55:47.965 --> 02:55:48.986]  2023 could be worse.
[02:55:49.246 --> 02:55:49.606]  UN.
[02:55:52.388 --> 02:55:55.530]  How insecurity will escalate food crisis in 2030?
[02:55:55.570 --> 02:55:56.631]  That's the London Guardian.
[02:55:58.012 --> 02:56:05.277]  Fertilizer shortages could pinch 2033 food supplies, says Ontario Federation of Agriculture.
[02:56:06.550 --> 02:56:09.211]  Why the food crisis might get worse before anything gets better.
[02:56:11.312 --> 02:56:13.313]  The supply chain to continue to be shaky in 2023.
[02:56:13.553 --> 02:56:17.834]  The food crisis is what happens when global chains collapse.
[02:56:18.294 --> 02:56:19.635]  We might need to get used to it.
[02:56:19.735 --> 02:56:20.996]  Yep, it's the new austerity.
[02:56:21.296 --> 02:56:22.376]  Just like Macron just said.
[02:56:23.036 --> 02:56:25.937]  UN Secretary General, serious food shortages are expected in 2023.
[02:56:25.977 --> 02:56:30.279]  The world could run out of food by 2023, warns Global Study.
[02:56:30.719 --> 02:56:34.981]  Food collapse programs warns of looming global catastrophe, PBS.
[02:56:36.226 --> 02:56:39.809]  World faces unprecedented global hunger crisis, UN chief says.
[02:56:39.869 --> 02:56:42.511]  Reuters, global crisis you're not hearing about.
[02:56:42.531 --> 02:56:47.935]  National Review, on and on and on.
[02:56:48.175 --> 02:56:52.979]  Now, it's not Russia and Ukraine that caused this, that just exacerbated it.
[02:56:54.621 --> 02:56:59.645]  It has been the Great Reset plan to cut off the resources, you will eat the bugs, you'll own nothing and you'll like it.
[02:57:00.811 --> 02:57:15.281]  Now is the time to get prepared, and we have a great sponsor, preparetoday.com, with the highest quality storable food company out there, My Patriot Supply, the biggest in the US, only around 14 years, but the biggest in the US because of their quality and the low cost.
