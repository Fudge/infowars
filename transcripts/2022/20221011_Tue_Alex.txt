[00:00:00.623 --> 00:00:10.408]  It's Tuesday, October 11, 2022, and the world is awakening to the deadly threat of imminent thermonuclear war.
[00:00:10.488 --> 00:00:12.709]  Here's Tulsi Gabbards leaving the Democratic Party.
[00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:29.078]  I can no longer remain in today's Democratic Party that's under the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers who are driven by cowardly wokeness, who divide us by racializing every issue and stoking anti-white racism.
[00:00:29.778 --> 00:00:35.002]  Who actively work to undermine our God-given freedoms that are enshrined in our Constitution.
[00:00:35.663 --> 00:00:39.126]  Who are hostile to people of faith and spirituality.
[00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:44.330]  Who demonize the police but protect criminals at the expense of law-abiding Americans.
[00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.212]  Who believe in open borders.
[00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:50.896]  Who weaponize the national security state to go after their political opponents.
[00:00:51.636 --> 00:00:55.820]  And above all, who are dragging us ever closer to nuclear war.
[00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.041]  Now, I believe in a government that's of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[00:01:04.162 --> 00:01:06.503]  Unfortunately, today's Democratic Party does not.
[00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:12.805]  Instead, it stands for a government that is of, by, and for the powerful elite.
[00:01:14.146 --> 00:01:21.189]  Now, I'm calling on my fellow common-sense, independent-minded Democrats to join me in leaving the Democratic Party.
[00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:27.674]   If you can no longer stomach the direction that the so-called woke Democratic Party ideologues
[00:01:27.674 --> 00:01:30.795]  are taking our country, I invite you to join me.
[00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:37.795]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:41.795]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:41.795 --> 00:02:01.795]  [Music]
[00:02:02.217 --> 00:02:03.003]  InfoWars.
[00:02:03.345 --> 00:02:04.231]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:02:04.554 --> 00:02:04.856]  Today.
[00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:09.986]  We do have some breaking news.
[00:02:10.026 --> 00:02:19.811]  There are satellite images and what they appear to show is rapid construction at several suspected silo fields in China that could eventually launch nuclear weapons.
[00:02:20.212 --> 00:02:24.754]  All of this as the country is also significantly bolstering its military capabilities.
[00:02:24.914 --> 00:02:26.275]  CNN has learned that the U.S.
[00:02:26.355 --> 00:02:35.861]  is developing contingency plans for possible Russian escalation in its war in Ukraine, including the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons.
[00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:42.944]  The prospect of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of possibility.
[00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:43.565]  U.S.
[00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:49.248]  Coast Guard spots Chinese guided missile cruiser and Russian naval ships off the Alaskan coast.
[00:02:49.308 --> 00:02:52.930]  A patrol boat found 86 miles off the coast of Alaska.
[00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:02.634]  Three Chinese naval ships, including a guided missile cruiser, as well as four Russian naval vessels, including a destroyer, spotted in a single battle formation.
[00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:14.364]   I think that Russia and China are working on things behind the scenes, and our leaders are so behind the ball, and our media is so behind, that they don't see what's going on.
[00:03:14.584 --> 00:03:19.946]  Instead of calming tensions, in fact, they seem to be deliberately provoking Russia.
[00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:20.566]  Breaking.
[00:03:20.586 --> 00:03:24.607]  Zelensky says NATO must, quote, launch preemptive strikes on Russia.
[00:03:24.627 --> 00:03:29.009]  They all believe that defending Ukraine is worth risking Armageddon.
[00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.528]  It means the end of the world.

[00:06:20.528 --> 00:06:26.528]   We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:28.979]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:34.542]  It's Tuesday, October 11, 2022, and the world is awakening.
[00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.931]  To the deadly threat of imminent thermonuclear war.
[00:06:42.011 --> 00:06:44.212]  Here's Tulsi Gabbard leaving the Democratic Party.
[00:06:44.872 --> 00:07:00.577]  I can no longer remain in today's Democratic Party that's under the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers who are driven by cowardly wokeness, who divide us by racializing every issue and stoking anti-white racism.
[00:07:01.297 --> 00:07:06.521]  Who actively work to undermine our God-given freedoms that are enshrined in our Constitution.
[00:07:07.182 --> 00:07:10.645]  Who are hostile to people of faith and spirituality.
[00:07:11.285 --> 00:07:15.849]  Who demonize the police but protect criminals at the expense of law-abiding Americans.
[00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.731]  Who believe in open borders.
[00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:22.415]  Who weaponize the national security state to go after their political opponents.
[00:07:23.155 --> 00:07:27.319]  And above all, who are dragging us ever closer to nuclear war.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.569]  No, I believe in a government that's of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[00:07:35.671 --> 00:07:38.014]  Unfortunately, today's Democratic Party does not.
[00:07:38.595 --> 00:07:44.263]  Instead, it stands for a government that is of, by, and for the powerful elite.
[00:07:45.877 --> 00:07:52.705]  I'm calling on my fellow common-sense, independent-minded Democrats to join me in leaving the Democratic Party.
[00:07:53.706 --> 00:08:02.357]  If you can no longer stomach the direction that the so-called woke Democratic Party ideologues are taking our country, then I invite you to join me.
[00:08:03.936 --> 00:08:10.421]  The Democratic Party is 100% a weaponized criminal globalist operation against America.
[00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:17.366]  Trump and our Liberty Movement got a major beachhead in the controlled neocon Republicans, and we are very close to taking over the Republican Party.
[00:08:18.367 --> 00:08:24.291]  That's why the globalists are starting wars, imploding borders, annihilating the economy, because they know they're on the way out.
[00:08:25.365 --> 00:08:26.865]  All right, we took a lot of calls yesterday.
[00:08:26.885 --> 00:08:32.026]  I thought they were really informative on World War III, on the economy, on the assaults on humanity.
[00:08:32.046 --> 00:08:36.067]  We're going to cover a lot of critical news as well today, but I want to give the number out.
[00:08:37.547 --> 00:08:41.028]  In fact, I'm going to give the number out at the start of the next segment.
[00:08:42.408 --> 00:08:44.088]  We're going to take calls throughout the broadcast.
[00:08:45.028 --> 00:08:54.550]  We also have several big guests joining us, like Stephen K. Bannon, Mike Adams, and others in the second and fourth hour today.
[00:08:56.172 --> 00:08:56.332]  Okay.
[00:08:56.352 --> 00:08:56.412]  Wow.
[00:08:56.231 --> 00:08:59.690]   Abandon's only over 30 minutes, so we'll take calls this hour, we'll take calls after Abandon
[00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.631]   leaves and then we have a whole hour before Mike Adams comes on, one to two, then Mike
[00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:06.670]  will always, as usual, knock it out of the park.
[00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:12.351]   So big broadcast lined up today as we attempt and have a lot of success igniting brush fires
[00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:15.471]  in the minds of men and women of liberty.
[00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:17.070]  Okay.
[00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.631]  Wow.
[00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:22.270]  You talk about exhausted.
[00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.711]  I am extremely exhausted.
[00:09:23.699 --> 00:09:24.479]  I look exhausted.
[00:09:24.499 --> 00:09:25.320]  I am exhausted.
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.821]  I know you're exhausted.
[00:09:28.181 --> 00:09:33.184]  But evil is even more tired than we are, and it's being worn out right now, and it's losing on every front.
[00:09:33.204 --> 00:09:36.066]  So we've just got to fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
[00:09:37.046 --> 00:09:46.211]  Because if we give up now, and if we don't go all in now, if you think things are bad today, woo-hoo, baby!
[00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:50.894]  We have not seen the tip of this iceberg yet.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:57.421]  So we're going to take your phone calls, first-time callers, long-time callers, people that agree, people that disagree.
[00:09:57.441 --> 00:10:00.742]  If you've got a serious beef with me, I'll debate you on it.
[00:10:00.782 --> 00:10:03.923]  If it's some made-up talking point, I'm not going to sit there and spin my wheels.
[00:10:04.724 --> 00:10:06.004]  But I love folks that disagree as well.
[00:10:06.604 --> 00:10:08.085]  Try to get an idea of what you're actually thinking.
[00:10:09.065 --> 00:10:12.586]  Let me tell you what's on the agenda today in between your phone calls.
[00:10:13.772 --> 00:10:42.992]   I have several big stacks that have been building up over the last few days that I haven't hit yet, that I do want to hit, and that is the whole transgenderism, weaponization coming after our children, shocking footage of men and women that have their testicles and breasts cut off, and penises cut off, and now when they say that they were coerced as children to sign up for this, they're being censored by the horrible, wicked monsters of big tech that are big pharma, That know exactly what they're doing.
[00:10:43.012 --> 00:10:58.476]  The same big pharma and big tech that censor the incredible news, document on every front that the so-called vaccines are not vaccines and are bioweapons that destroy the blood, just to start, in their host bodies.
[00:10:59.416 --> 00:11:28.691]   FDA will withhold autopsy results of those who died after COVID shots in latest shocker, but we already have the epidemiologist Out of Germany, and out of the UK, and out of Canada, the US, and Australia, confirming the coroners, the pathologists, the virologists, all of them, coming out and documenting that it is the shots that are killing people, at least 6 million dead we know of.
[00:11:29.551 --> 00:11:36.294]  This is a genocide of biblical proportions and they're just getting started.
[00:11:37.458 --> 00:11:47.285]  And so for all of you that signed on with the New World Order, all of you that signed on for censorship, all of you that signed on for tyranny, I hope you really feel good about yourselves.
[00:11:48.346 --> 00:11:53.769]  Because you are destroying us along with your evil asses.
[00:11:54.750 --> 00:12:03.576]  And I understand you get a thrill out of evil, you get a thrill out of oppression, you get a thrill out of dominance, and because you sided with the powers that be, you think you're winning.
[00:12:03.977 --> 00:12:05.898]  You're only winning for a short season.
[00:12:09.394 --> 00:12:13.596]  You're only winning for a very short period and you lose in the end.
[00:12:13.937 --> 00:12:22.221]  You may win some battles, but you are and you will lose your war against humanity.
[00:12:23.942 --> 00:12:25.643]  Then we've got this big stack of reports.
[00:12:27.224 --> 00:12:35.609]  Last week the World Economic Forum was given a hundred million dollars by the Canadian government to establish a World ID.
[00:12:37.574 --> 00:12:45.999]  This week, Bill Gates donated $200 million to expand the program, and they're using the Communist Chinese World ID as the model.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.282]  Complete with our new Chinese police departments, Communist Chinese departments.
[00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:53.544]  We're setting up in every Western nation to keep an eye on us.
[00:12:54.165 --> 00:12:56.706]  We now have the Chinese Communist World ID system.
[00:12:57.347 --> 00:12:58.447]  That's coming up.
[00:13:00.168 --> 00:13:06.933]  We'll also tie that in to the Democrats not liking their own medicine.
[00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:27.780]  And that is just more and more ridiculous, oxymoronic statements by the mayor of DC, the mayor of New York, the mayor of Chicago, and other Democrat mayors saying, we are in an emergency.
[00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:30.902]  We can't take any illegal aliens.
[00:13:32.262 --> 00:13:33.483]  This is the end of the world.
[00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:47.696]   And Not understanding the fact, or they do understand the fact, that they're the ones running the policy that caused this.
[00:13:49.918 --> 00:13:54.541]  But as soon as it's put in their backyard, they scream bloody murders.
[00:13:54.561 --> 00:14:04.048]  We've got some new totally insane clips on that front coming up at the start of the next segment that just really show how the minions of the New World Order are pretty stupid.
[00:14:04.768 --> 00:14:11.635]   Because I can tell you, the mayor of Chicago, the mayor of New York, the mayor of D.C.
[00:14:12.296 --> 00:14:14.358]  These are puppets put there because they're stupid.
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:21.304]  And it's the people behind them, running them, and controlling them that are the truly evil folks.
[00:14:22.965 --> 00:14:33.254]  But Mayor Eric Adams has declared an emergency in New York, saying we didn't plan for this, we didn't ask this, we can't handle this, it's gotta stop.
[00:14:33.535 --> 00:14:34.215]  It's gotta stop?
[00:14:34.596 --> 00:14:36.858]  You got what, 20,000 illegal aliens, Buster?
[00:14:38.342 --> 00:14:39.642]  Texas has got 10 million.
[00:14:40.623 --> 00:14:41.963]  Arizona's got more than 10 million.
[00:14:42.003 --> 00:14:43.424]  California's got 30 million.
[00:14:48.105 --> 00:14:49.266]  How do you like going bankrupt?
[00:14:49.746 --> 00:14:52.967]  How do you like all the collapse of society and the social safety net going away?
[00:14:53.587 --> 00:14:56.448]  How do you like the third world's poorest people being moved here?
[00:14:57.535 --> 00:15:00.296]  After the UN cut off their food and water for two years.
[00:15:00.476 --> 00:15:01.596]  I don't blame these people coming here.
[00:15:01.936 --> 00:15:03.277]  They're refugees in the New World Order.
[00:15:04.037 --> 00:15:05.738]  And then a New World Order puppet sits up there.
[00:15:05.798 --> 00:15:06.858]  I'm not saying they should be allowed in.
[00:15:06.878 --> 00:15:07.778]  I'm just saying I don't hate them.
[00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:14.200]  No, I hate the globalists that engineered the collapse of their countries and then send them here to collapse us.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.281]  And that's what this is.
[00:15:15.641 --> 00:15:17.521]  It's total and complete weaponization.
[00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:19.122]  With the crime waves.
[00:15:20.546 --> 00:15:22.908]  And the homelessness and the fentanyl and all of it.
[00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:25.410]  This is war against our country.
[00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.411]  Infowars.com.
[00:15:28.112 --> 00:15:29.533]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:15:29.553 --> 00:15:34.897]  We're going to be laying it all out here with so much more.
[00:15:35.317 --> 00:15:36.758]  And as I said, your phone calls.
[00:15:37.218 --> 00:15:40.741]  I'll give the number out when we come back on the other side.
[00:15:41.862 --> 00:15:42.882]  Infowars.com.
[00:15:44.168 --> 00:15:46.749]  Stands as the beacon of resistance against the globalists.
[00:15:47.169 --> 00:15:49.810]  And I thank you all for tuning in today, and I thank you all for sharing the links.
[00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.530]  Because this is the time InfoWars was built for.
[00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:58.072]  This time in history right now, people are more open-minded to the truth than ever.
[00:15:58.972 --> 00:16:01.753]  We'll be right back as we battle the Great Reset and the New World Order.
[00:16:02.813 --> 00:16:07.216]  Florida's Surgeon General, Dr. Joseph Latimpo, is a hero.
[00:16:07.837 --> 00:16:09.458]  He's the type of person we need as U.S.
[00:16:09.498 --> 00:16:13.801]  Surgeon General, and we need people like Governor DeSantis as President.
[00:16:14.962 --> 00:16:28.872]  He went on The War Room yesterday with Steve Bannon, who joins us next hour, and laid out the evil, just murderous coordination between big tech and government to silence the medical truth of the weapon we've just been hit with.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:35.628]  Dr. Latipo, did Twitter, did the senior management of Twitter, did any of these social media oligarchs took you down?
[00:16:35.648 --> 00:16:44.120]  Did anybody reach out to you and ask you for the backup analytics, to ask you about your study, to ask you about anything before they took you down, sir?
[00:16:46.779 --> 00:16:48.520]  Surely they reached out to me personally.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.502]  I guess in theory, maybe they reached out to the office, but I have heard no such thing.
[00:16:53.962 --> 00:17:23.992]   But, you know, this whole, I mean, it is really almost criminal, really, in terms of how much disregard that they have for Human rights that and I'm not talking just about Twitter, but this whole body that thinks it's okay to crush the voices of others because you don't like their message.
[00:17:24.612 --> 00:17:38.028]   Here's a message that this is not a message that is in our interests or in in someone else's of the data, the information that we were providing.
[00:17:38.028 --> 00:17:44.509]   It's a message for people, for humanity, so that people can make informed decisions.
[00:17:44.509 --> 00:17:46.028]  You wanna do more research?
[00:17:46.028 --> 00:17:47.148]  Terrific.
[00:17:47.148 --> 00:17:51.987]   You think you've already seen enough evidence and you think our methods are persuasive to you,
[00:17:51.987 --> 00:17:56.108]  that you believe that our results are correct?
[00:17:56.647 --> 00:17:57.167]  Terrific!
[00:17:58.088 --> 00:18:16.703]   Humans, people, get to make those choices, but this body of tech and other forces that come in and silence people, I don't think human beings have the right to have free access to information that they don't want them to have access to.
[00:18:17.124 --> 00:18:19.969]  So it's, I mean, it's, you know, Twitter, yes, but it's a huge deal.
[00:18:21.365 --> 00:18:23.086]  He said almost criminal.
[00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:24.407]  No, it's mass murder.
[00:18:24.787 --> 00:18:45.138]  It's extremely criminal to block tens of thousands of doctors and scientists and millions of citizens telling the truth and what they experienced and how the shots made them sick and how they suppressed all the therapeutics like hydroxychloroquine and of course countless other things that are devastating to COVID and incredibly empowering to the body.
[00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:51.089]  Unbelievable what these monsters have done to Ivermectin and so much more.
[00:18:51.109 --> 00:18:53.251]  I want to shift gears into the war.
[00:18:53.431 --> 00:18:54.873]  Big developments on that front.
[00:18:55.033 --> 00:18:56.294]  Escalations every day.
[00:18:57.996 --> 00:19:09.046]  The Russians are now rolled out evidence of an attack drone with a bomb that crashed and unsuccessfully did not detonate, blowing up Nord Stream 1.
[00:19:11.243 --> 00:19:12.884]  This turned out to have happened years ago.
[00:19:12.904 --> 00:19:13.784]  We're going to be getting to that.
[00:19:14.564 --> 00:19:20.866]  Russia is now blowing up and destroying most of the power-producing structures in Ukraine.
[00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:25.248]  So this has gone from a police action, as Putin called it, to full-out war.
[00:19:25.268 --> 00:19:30.009]  And he's brought in this scorched-earth general who has the nickname General Armageddon.
[00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:31.430]  So good job, New World Order.
[00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:43.991]   But I'll play a few clips from years ago of Soros bragging And Obama bragging about what they set up and the overthrow of the government in Ukraine and what it has led to today.
[00:19:45.612 --> 00:19:52.877]  ...foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent of Russia.
[00:19:53.137 --> 00:19:57.000]  And the foundation has been functioning ever since.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:03.264]  There's one person who was very deeply involved in Ukraine.
[00:20:04.826 --> 00:20:06.046]  And that's Biden.
[00:20:06.707 --> 00:20:16.974]  He had a lot more patience than I had in trying to convert Poroshenko into a democratic leader.
[00:20:17.334 --> 00:20:27.941]  But the opportunity to generate a united Ukraine and getting it right is within your grasp.
[00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:33.093]   And we want to be your your partner, your friend in the project, we want to and we're
[00:20:33.093 --> 00:20:34.013]  ready to assist.
[00:20:34.013 --> 00:20:40.711]   We're also asking Congress to act promptly to deliver on an aid package
[00:20:40.711 --> 00:20:47.312]   including a $1 billion loan guarantee that can help smooth the path for reform
[00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:52.312]   inside of Ukraine and give the Prime Minister and his government the capacity
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:55.113]  to do what they need to do as they are also...
[00:20:56.312 --> 00:20:59.312]  I just get overloaded at a certain point.
[00:20:59.523 --> 00:21:03.265]  And in the past I spent about 10% of my time getting funding to keep us on air.
[00:21:03.766 --> 00:21:05.227]  Now I spend 50% of my time.
[00:21:06.007 --> 00:21:06.768]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:21:07.008 --> 00:21:08.269]  It's just something I don't like doing.
[00:21:08.449 --> 00:21:10.190]  And it irritates me because I don't like business.
[00:21:10.631 --> 00:21:11.291]  I don't like numbers.
[00:21:11.351 --> 00:21:12.912]  I don't like jacking with stuff constantly.
[00:21:12.932 --> 00:21:15.274]  But the good news is, InfoWars is still on air.
[00:21:15.354 --> 00:21:16.475]  We have a plan to stay on air.
[00:21:17.195 --> 00:21:22.919]  And it would take a big stress off of me and keep this important operation on air if folks would continue to support what you've been doing.
[00:21:22.939 --> 00:21:23.580]  And I want to thank you.
[00:21:24.349 --> 00:21:26.570]  We're shipping stuff within 24 hours of your order coming in.
[00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:35.933]  We've got products you really need right now at InfoWarStore.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:21:36.633 --> 00:21:40.294]  And there's been big runs on iodine because of all the nuclear war news.
[00:21:40.775 --> 00:21:45.976]  We don't sell the highest quality iodine as a protection from nuclear war because it's not really a protection from nuclear war, folks.
[00:21:46.537 --> 00:21:51.138]  Yes, a few isotopes are the most common in fallout that go into the thyroid.
[00:21:51.338 --> 00:21:58.494]   If your body has good iodine already in your thyroid, It won't absorb the radioactive isotopes, and that's one of the main causes of death.
[00:21:59.935 --> 00:22:05.959]  But if there's a nuclear war, there'll be mass starvation and total collapse of civilization, and so, you know, might as well just go ahead and die quickly, in my view.
[00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:10.942]  The reason we sell high-quality iodine, the highest quality you're gonna find anywhere...
[00:22:12.034 --> 00:22:22.023]  Is because it's incredible for your whole body, and when you do have good iodine in the thyroid, it blocks all the bad halogens like chlorine, fluoride, bromide, you name it.
[00:22:22.463 --> 00:22:32.632]  So, X3 is back in stock, 50% off, and I've extended the big super sale for a few more days, 40-50% off, store-wide, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:22:33.252 --> 00:22:39.438]  On Brain Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra, vitamin C with zinc and more.
[00:22:40.757 --> 00:22:50.839]  All right, I want to open the phones up throughout the next three hours plus that we're hosting here today on any subject you want to raise, any topic you want to bring up.
[00:22:50.939 --> 00:22:52.400]  I love the wildcard nature of it.
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.380]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.380]  Let me get back to where we were.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:03.519]   2539-877-789-2539-877-789-ALEX. Let me get back to where we were.
[00:23:03.519 --> 00:23:07.759]   So I just played you a clip of George Soros and Obama bragging about the overthrow of Ukraine.
[00:23:07.759 --> 00:23:12.239]  And there's countless other clips of them saying it as well.
[00:23:12.452 --> 00:23:24.059]  And then we have this clip from Stephen Colbert program back in 2014 talking to a Council on Foreign Relations globalist member, Gideon Rose.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:36.047]  And there they are laughing and giggling about the whole project to basically take over and overthrow Ukraine, the birthplace of the Slavic Russian culture.
[00:23:36.872 --> 00:23:41.175]  Go back a thousand years ago, his name was basically translated Slav the Great.
[00:23:41.575 --> 00:23:43.436]  His last name was Slav.
[00:23:43.516 --> 00:23:46.278]  I'm not good at Slavic tongue, I apologize.
[00:23:46.679 --> 00:23:47.619]  Anybody can look this up.
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:52.783]  So, Russian culture started in central Ukraine today, or Slavic culture.
[00:23:53.443 --> 00:24:00.288]  Doesn't matter if you're Polish, doesn't matter if you're Serbian, doesn't matter if you're Russian, Belarusian, it's all the same culture.
[00:24:01.218 --> 00:24:04.240]  And so this is a big deal the Russians to have this being taken away.
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.761]  And so now you got a war.
[00:24:06.341 --> 00:24:07.822]  And now the war is escalating out of control.
[00:24:07.843 --> 00:24:11.045]  But here they are years ago laying the groundwork.
[00:24:12.346 --> 00:24:22.692]  Now, eight years ago, for exactly what has happened, the overthrow of the Ukrainian government and a puppet that has now been installed.
[00:24:23.433 --> 00:24:28.957]  And that's why we're sliding into thermonuclear war and economic collapse right now.
[00:24:29.297 --> 00:24:30.718]  Here is the disgusting clip.
[00:24:31.565 --> 00:24:34.989]  I just wish Ronald Reagan were still alive to fix this mess.
[00:24:35.589 --> 00:24:41.155]  Here to tell me how to reanimate Reagan is the editor of Foreign Affairs magazine, Gideon Rose.
[00:24:41.195 --> 00:24:42.957]  Mr. Rose, thank you so much for being here.
[00:24:44.098 --> 00:24:45.119]  Yeah, he's a warmonger!
[00:24:45.139 --> 00:24:47.121]  There's the magazine, Foreign Affairs.
[00:24:49.413 --> 00:24:51.675]  Now, Gideon, help me out here.
[00:24:51.935 --> 00:24:53.195]  We've got a battle.
[00:24:53.215 --> 00:24:59.779]  The Ukraine, some of them want to go into the EU, the European Union, and some of them want to stay with Russia.
[00:25:00.099 --> 00:25:03.021]  If the Ukraine's not in Europe right now, what continent is it on?
[00:25:03.381 --> 00:25:07.363]  Well, it's part of Eurasia, but it's part of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet bloc.
[00:25:07.663 --> 00:25:10.644]  It's basically Robin to Russia's Batman.
[00:25:11.125 --> 00:25:17.388]  And the challenge here is to try to attract it to the West, to get it to flip sides.
[00:25:17.708 --> 00:25:20.789]  So the rebels in the streets, what are they fighting for?
[00:25:21.009 --> 00:25:22.310]  They're fighting for a better future.
[00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:24.691]  Countries have a development... That sounds like a political speech.
[00:25:24.731 --> 00:25:25.971]  No, but it's actually true.
[00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:28.172]  Countries have to develop over time.
[00:25:28.332 --> 00:25:32.513]  And Ukraine basically, after the end of the Soviet Union, faced two tracks.
[00:25:32.633 --> 00:25:37.235]  It could stay a sort of stagnant, corrupt, authoritarian country tied to Russia.
[00:25:37.735 --> 00:25:39.616]  Or it could essentially join the West.
[00:25:39.916 --> 00:25:42.357]  It could modernize, liberalize, become a democracy.
[00:25:43.017 --> 00:25:54.042]  At the last minute, when it looked like it was going to trade up from its sort of abusive relationship with its boyfriend from the hood to a nice yuppie... You're not loading these choices in any way whatsoever.
[00:25:54.822 --> 00:25:55.603]  It's actually true.
[00:25:55.803 --> 00:26:01.305]  When it looked like it was going to trade up to a better environment, at the last minute, Putin offered a bribe.
[00:26:01.585 --> 00:26:02.006]  How much?
[00:26:02.166 --> 00:26:02.486]  $15 billion.
[00:26:03.526 --> 00:26:04.227]  It's a lot of cash, man.
[00:26:04.247 --> 00:26:04.827]  It's a lot of cash.
[00:26:04.988 --> 00:26:13.595]  And the president, who himself was tied to the old elites and the eastern part of the country who ties to Russia, decided to back off the change and go join Russia.
[00:26:13.635 --> 00:26:16.577]  Do you know how many pirate-themed restaurants you can buy with $15 billion?
[00:26:17.518 --> 00:26:27.206]  The problem was the western parts of the country and the younger parts of the country and the more modern liberal parts of the country basically knew that they had no future being Russia's vassal.
[00:26:27.306 --> 00:26:28.447]  And so they took to the streets.
[00:26:28.607 --> 00:26:31.010]  Is America taking sides in this in any way?
[00:26:31.191 --> 00:26:33.915]  If these people, the rebels are winning right now, right?
[00:26:34.135 --> 00:26:34.976]  Yes, just recently.
[00:26:35.156 --> 00:26:42.907]  Why isn't Obama spiking the ball in the end zone and calling Putin and saying, hey, you might have won the medal count, but we won the country count, biatch!
[00:26:44.509 --> 00:26:53.292]  It's actually a very good question, and the answer is that we don't want Russia to intervene and kick over the table like a game of Risk and take Ukraine back.
[00:26:53.632 --> 00:26:54.293]  Do they do that?
[00:26:54.333 --> 00:26:55.193]  Could he send in troops?
[00:26:55.253 --> 00:26:56.013]  Yes, he could.
[00:26:56.213 --> 00:26:58.754]  So we are choosing... Does Ukraine have any troops of their own?
[00:26:58.794 --> 00:26:59.554]  Would they fight back?
[00:26:59.634 --> 00:27:02.736]  Yes, but we don't want this to escalate, and we don't want Russia to crack down.
[00:27:02.796 --> 00:27:05.156]  So we want to basically distract Russia.
[00:27:05.236 --> 00:27:06.837]  Oh, look, you have the highest medal count.
[00:27:07.137 --> 00:27:08.077]  Oh, you did really well.
[00:27:11.019 --> 00:27:20.883]  There's a power vacuum right now.
[00:27:20.963 --> 00:27:21.803]  There's a power vacuum.
[00:27:21.823 --> 00:27:23.144]  The opposition is all together.
[00:27:23.244 --> 00:27:31.948]  It's easy to agree on getting rid of the bad old regime and much harder to create a stable country in which everybody compromises and moves forward.
[00:27:31.968 --> 00:27:34.248]  They need a strong leader to move the country forward.
[00:27:34.489 --> 00:27:36.089]  Do you know who's always good at a moment like that?
[00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:37.690]  Vladimir Putin.
[00:27:39.073 --> 00:27:42.454]  Do you think he might volunteer to come in and help Ukraine?
[00:27:43.214 --> 00:27:51.777]  The reason we don't want, we don't want Putin to get involved in this and so we are basically, we want to try and involve him in this decision so that he allows Ukraine to go.
[00:27:51.817 --> 00:27:55.679]  We actually want to not, we want to say we want a non-exclusive relationship with Ukraine.
[00:27:55.719 --> 00:27:57.099]  You can have a relationship with it too.
[00:27:57.419 --> 00:27:59.860]  You're the only one making this into a girlfriend-boyfriend relationship.
[00:28:00.632 --> 00:28:09.962]  Ukraine is basically choosing its future between two completely different courses of action and we're trying to blur that choice so the old boyfriend doesn't get too upset when it makes the right choice towards us.
[00:28:11.944 --> 00:28:14.246]  He might punch us in the face.
[00:28:15.291 --> 00:28:17.291]  Well, thank you so much, Gideon Rose.
[00:28:17.291 --> 00:28:19.291]  Gideon Rose.
[00:28:19.291 --> 00:28:22.291]   So that's what they do is they have Foreign Affairs, the publication of the New World Order,
[00:28:22.291 --> 00:28:25.291]   the globalists that want to end our country on their own admissions,
[00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:27.291]  up there selling World War III, and now here we are.
[00:28:27.291 --> 00:28:29.291]  Now here's a new clip that just came out today.
[00:28:29.291 --> 00:28:32.291]  This is a Nobel Prize winner, just got it.
[00:28:32.291 --> 00:28:37.291]   Oleksandr Matvelychuk is standing beside the Kiev playground
[00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:41.841]   that was hit by a piece of Russian missile, calling for Ukraine to be given advanced air defense
[00:28:41.841 --> 00:28:42.291]  systems.
[00:28:42.558 --> 00:28:46.440]  So, again, you get peace prizes now for calling for expanded wars.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.200]  Here's the clip.
[00:28:49.581 --> 00:28:51.022]  My name is Aleksandra Matvelychuk.
[00:28:51.962 --> 00:28:53.763]  I'm head of Center for Civil Liberties.
[00:28:54.543 --> 00:28:58.845]  Our organization received this week the Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:29:00.145 --> 00:29:01.306]  I am in the center of Kiev.
[00:29:02.273 --> 00:29:10.936]  Near the children's playground, where a lot of children with their parents are playing every day.
[00:29:12.496 --> 00:29:16.838]  This children's playground was hit by Russian rockets today.
[00:29:17.998 --> 00:29:22.640]  Near, you can see the National Taras Shevchenko University.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:29.022]  It's my alma mater, where I have studied for years.
[00:29:30.595 --> 00:29:34.745]  There is no military necessity in hitting these objects.
[00:29:35.728 --> 00:29:39.437]  Russians did these things because they could.
[00:29:40.974 --> 00:29:46.999]  We ask international community to recognize Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:54.244]  We ask international community to provide Ukraine the modern air defense systems.
[00:29:55.145 --> 00:30:08.696]  We ask to stop this circle of impunity, to create international tribunal and hold Putin, Lukashenko and other war criminals accountable.
[00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:15.854]  By the way, I'm not defending the Russian invasion of Ukraine any more than I'm defending the globalist start in the whole thing.
[00:30:16.534 --> 00:30:18.176]  But if you look at the playground, there's not even a crater.
[00:30:18.196 --> 00:30:22.299]  There's people wandering around where supposedly a bomb fell, obviously off-target if it even did.
[00:30:22.319 --> 00:30:23.900]  They're just lying.
[00:30:24.981 --> 00:30:25.742]  And why do we know that?
[00:30:26.783 --> 00:30:32.668]  This woman was given a Nobel Peace Prize because she's a warmongering fraud, just like Henry Kissinger was given a Peace Prize.
[00:30:33.088 --> 00:30:34.930]  Or Obama was given one.
[00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.651]  Why don't they give Hitler one posthumously?
[00:30:37.714 --> 00:30:38.814]  So I want to see the crater.
[00:30:38.894 --> 00:30:40.435]  I want to see where the playground got hit.
[00:30:41.055 --> 00:30:48.677]  These are the same folks that lied and talked about, oh, everybody got killed on this island, on Snake Island, by the Russians.
[00:30:48.717 --> 00:30:49.597]  It wasn't true.
[00:30:49.717 --> 00:30:52.898]  And a man shot a Russian MiG down with a shotgun.
[00:30:52.958 --> 00:30:53.698]  Wasn't true.
[00:30:53.778 --> 00:30:55.458]  And there were Russian mass graves.
[00:30:55.558 --> 00:30:56.278]  Wasn't true.
[00:30:59.039 --> 00:30:59.739]  Wasn't true.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.940]  Over and over again.
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:11.449]   Yes, are now Military and government sites being hit and our shrapnel flying into the public.
[00:31:11.489 --> 00:31:11.809]  Yeah!
[00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:17.014]  Because they've been launching attacks inside Russia and in Russian annexed areas.
[00:31:17.054 --> 00:31:23.300]  So now the war is going from the Vogue photo shoots and everybody... There you go.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.782]  There's a crater on the edge of the playground.
[00:31:25.703 --> 00:31:26.443]  That's what we need to see.
[00:31:27.765 --> 00:31:28.926]  Now it's all gone.
[00:31:31.462 --> 00:31:35.085]  From some distant thing that they're doing to the Russians to now it's happening to them.
[00:31:35.145 --> 00:31:35.766]  It's a tragedy.
[00:31:36.486 --> 00:31:39.769]  And I'm absolutely against it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:39.969 --> 00:31:41.170]  And I'm against World War III.
[00:31:41.651 --> 00:31:42.652]  And I think it's terrible.
[00:31:44.393 --> 00:31:46.695]  Absolutely terrible.
[00:31:47.356 --> 00:31:48.257]  But that's where we are.
[00:31:48.297 --> 00:31:49.017]  Now we come back.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.463]  We got a very special clip that's going viral.
[00:31:56.444 --> 00:31:57.084]  Wait till we get there.
[00:31:57.104 --> 00:31:57.865]  We'll play it coming up.
[00:31:57.905 --> 00:31:58.866]  And then Steve Bannon joins us.
[00:32:00.609 --> 00:32:03.551]  Welcome back to this Tuesday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:03.591 --> 00:32:04.711]  Very blessed and honored to be here.
[00:32:05.952 --> 00:32:07.973]  He's got a lot of big breaking news coming up.
[00:32:08.193 --> 00:32:10.714]  The one and only Steve Bannon joining us at the start of the next hour.
[00:32:11.055 --> 00:32:14.436]  He'll be gone 30 minutes into the hour and then right back to your phone calls.
[00:32:14.456 --> 00:32:20.280]  I'm going to go to some of your phone calls in Australia and Texas and Maryland and Arizona and New Jersey here in a moment.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.320]  But I wanted to play this clip.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:22.341]  It's gone super viral.
[00:32:23.579 --> 00:32:32.008]  My old friend Joe Rogan here in Austin yesterday questioning the founder of Rolling Stone magazine, Jan Wenner.
[00:32:32.989 --> 00:32:35.392]  And this is the perfect old hippie.
[00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:46.113]  He launches Rolling Stone about the drug culture and free speech and all this, and now he says the government's got to censor everybody, the government's got to control everybody.
[00:32:46.133 --> 00:32:57.636]  That's how the left has fully embraced authoritarianism, totalitarianism, communism, fascism, whatever you want to call it, and says the government should decide, like the FDA, what food you can eat.
[00:32:59.357 --> 00:33:06.239]  And he uses the example of the FDA does such a great job with drugs, and Joe Rogan nails him, saying 25% of drugs get recalled.
[00:33:08.706 --> 00:33:10.947]  And now the FDA's a rubber stamp of Big Pharma.
[00:33:11.628 --> 00:33:17.671]  So listen to these old, and I'm not against old people in general, but these old leftists are the worst.
[00:33:18.612 --> 00:33:20.353]  And this is what they believe across the board.
[00:33:20.353 --> 00:33:21.353]  Here he is.
[00:33:21.353 --> 00:33:22.353]  [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[00:33:22.353 --> 00:33:23.353]  Regulate the internet?
[00:33:23.353 --> 00:33:24.353]  Absolutely.
[00:33:24.353 --> 00:33:27.712]   You trust the people that got us into the Iraq war under false pretenses to regulate
[00:33:27.712 --> 00:33:28.711]  the internet?
[00:33:28.711 --> 00:33:29.711]  Uh, I'm not--
[00:33:29.711 --> 00:33:30.711]  Do you think that makes any sense?
[00:33:30.711 --> 00:33:31.951]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:33:31.951 --> 00:33:32.951]  I would not--
[00:33:32.951 --> 00:33:33.951]  Oh, I started over.
[00:33:33.951 --> 00:33:34.951]  --the people got us into the Iraq--
[00:33:34.951 --> 00:33:35.951]  Hit pause.
[00:33:35.951 --> 00:33:36.952]  Bring it back to the beginning.
[00:33:36.952 --> 00:33:37.952]  I want to say something here.
[00:33:37.952 --> 00:33:39.313]  I covered this six years ago, five years ago.
[00:33:39.304 --> 00:33:45.951]  It was in mainline government documents, mainline Wall Street Journal reports, saying, don't worry about dinosaur media.
[00:33:45.991 --> 00:33:47.192]  Don't worry about legacy media.
[00:33:47.532 --> 00:33:51.937]  We've got a plan to censor the left and the right, starting with WikiLeaks and Alex Jones.
[00:33:52.798 --> 00:33:54.840]  And when we're done with them, we're going to censor everybody.
[00:33:59.076 --> 00:34:10.041]  Now the Secretary of State in Texas came out and attacked me all over the news today and said I caused threats on election officials questioning the Texas election in 2020.
[00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:12.022]  I didn't question the Texas election.
[00:34:13.154 --> 00:34:13.774]  Trump won.
[00:34:14.495 --> 00:34:15.555]  The Republicans won here.
[00:34:15.615 --> 00:34:17.316]  Yeah, there was some fraud, but I barely covered it.
[00:34:17.896 --> 00:34:19.957]  And now they want to sue me and take me off air for that.
[00:34:20.197 --> 00:34:25.860]  Because they had an FBI agent, never knew who he was, never said his name, who was involved in Sandy Hook, responding to it.
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.441]  He sued me for $550 million, never said his name.
[00:34:29.701 --> 00:34:36.944]  So now if you criticize a government response, or you criticize government, period, the bureaucrats are going to sue you?
[00:34:37.004 --> 00:34:40.126]  That's all over the news today.
[00:34:43.652 --> 00:34:54.116]  Yahoo, AP, Reuters, Republican Texas election chief blasts nuts peddling 2020 conspiracy theories and zooms in on Alex Jones.
[00:34:56.076 --> 00:34:57.057]  Because I'm the target.
[00:34:57.577 --> 00:35:02.439]  For now, more lawsuits against you criticize government, the bureaucrats sue you.
[00:35:03.739 --> 00:35:05.620]  I told you it's not about me, it's about you.
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:16.731]   But let's get back to the founder, Jan Winter, of Rolling Stone, and just listen to this dirtbag.
[00:35:16.571 --> 00:35:17.571]  Here it is.
[00:35:17.571 --> 00:35:19.051]  You trust the government to regulate the internet?
[00:35:19.051 --> 00:35:20.051]  Absolutely.
[00:35:20.051 --> 00:35:23.971]   You trust the people that got us into the Iraq war under false pretenses to regulate
[00:35:23.971 --> 00:35:24.971]  the internet?
[00:35:24.971 --> 00:35:27.051]  Do you think that makes any sense?
[00:35:27.051 --> 00:35:28.211]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:35:28.211 --> 00:35:29.250]  I would not.
[00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.891]  The people who got us into the Iraq war.
[00:35:30.891 --> 00:35:31.891]  It's the government.
[00:35:31.891 --> 00:35:33.930]  No, it's the politicians.
[00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:34.930]  It's the government.
[00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:37.290]  In the end, yes, it's the government.
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.741]  But who else is going to regulate?
[00:35:38.761 --> 00:35:43.962]  But if they're going to be in power, and they're regulating the internet, they're going to regulate the internet in a way that suits their best interests.
[00:35:44.002 --> 00:35:51.824]  The same way they do with the banking industry, the same way they do with the environment, the same way they do with energy, the same way they do with everything.
[00:35:52.705 --> 00:35:54.365]  What represents their interests?
[00:35:54.605 --> 00:36:00.670]  There's so much, you're talking about so much money involved in disseminating information in a very particular way.
[00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:04.393]  And the rich economies of the world right now, or the internet companies, are rich beyond belief.
[00:36:04.493 --> 00:36:09.056]  Yeah, but it's a disruptive thing that has never existed before.
[00:36:09.076 --> 00:36:14.380]  I think it exists, and I think where we're at is where we're at.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:37.079]   I think we need to move forward collectively as a country with an ethic that Respects truth and that it appreciates opinions and reality and an understanding of things That's not necessarily possible with corporate interests involved in dissemination of information But there's no way to do that except through the government
[00:36:37.702 --> 00:36:41.204]  There's no way you can do that except through the government.
[00:36:41.704 --> 00:36:43.065]  Human nature is not going to change.
[00:36:43.105 --> 00:36:44.505]  But the government's not going to change either.
[00:36:44.625 --> 00:36:46.386]  But the government is capable of change.
[00:36:47.707 --> 00:36:50.588]  The government regulates, for example, the food supply.
[00:36:52.649 --> 00:36:53.769]  The food supply?
[00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:55.570]  Yeah, the Department of Agriculture.
[00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:58.712]  Why have they let glyphosate infestate all of our foods?
[00:36:59.292 --> 00:37:01.733]  Yeah, but that's the problem.
[00:37:01.753 --> 00:37:03.413]  That's the government regulating... I agree.
[00:37:03.433 --> 00:37:07.294]  Well, then we better get better politicians in them to support better people.
[00:37:07.394 --> 00:37:11.555]  Again, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
[00:37:11.715 --> 00:37:11.916]  Right.
[00:37:12.556 --> 00:37:19.678]  So, let's take the SEC, or take the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates big pharma.
[00:37:20.078 --> 00:37:24.699]  On the one hand, we've got a very safe supply of drugs in this country.
[00:37:25.179 --> 00:37:25.499]  Safe?
[00:37:26.019 --> 00:37:27.740]  Drugs are tested.
[00:37:28.737 --> 00:37:34.442]  You know, you don't get too many bad drugs, you know, prescribed drugs out of the market.
[00:37:34.462 --> 00:37:37.004]  25% of all drugs approved by the FDA get recalled.
[00:37:38.406 --> 00:37:50.136]  So that old authoritarian communist that's filthy rich, who wants you to be poor, he just said human nature doesn't change, we can't trust the public with speech, but government can change, we can trust the government.
[00:37:52.096 --> 00:37:55.598]  The whole country's founded on us having free speech, unlike other countries.
[00:37:55.858 --> 00:37:56.979]  That's why people wanted to come here.
[00:37:57.059 --> 00:37:57.719]  One of the main reasons.
[00:37:58.159 --> 00:37:59.860]  This guy's anti-American.
[00:38:03.462 --> 00:38:10.646]  And then Joe Rogan talks about, we need to have a culture of values that's for free speech.
[00:38:10.666 --> 00:38:12.067]  And he's like, yeah.
[00:38:12.887 --> 00:38:15.869]  The Rolling Stone geezer says, run by the government.
[00:38:17.861 --> 00:38:28.649]  Because he was in those meetings, folks, five, six years ago, they had a bunch of them, where they told him, you'll still have a job, you'll still have sponsors, you'll still be successful once we shut all your competition down.
[00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:35.274]  And that's why this old loser, nothing against him, he's old, but I'm saying old ideas, failed systems.
[00:38:36.135 --> 00:38:40.158]  That's why he wants censorship, because nobody's reading Rolling Stone.
[00:38:40.959 --> 00:38:44.482]  It went from being a broadsheet to a little bitty thing, and now it's failing financially.
[00:38:44.882 --> 00:38:48.526]  It puts out fake articles about Ivermectin killing thousands in Oklahoma.
[00:38:49.687 --> 00:38:52.569]  It puts out fake articles about me calling for me to be taken off the air.
[00:38:52.709 --> 00:38:53.610]  It's a joke!
[00:38:54.491 --> 00:38:56.072]  It's pro-establishment!
[00:38:57.893 --> 00:38:59.435]  I'm gonna go to Allister in Australia.

[00:40:57.459 --> 00:40:58.859]  I want to thank all of you that have gotten the coin.
[00:40:59.179 --> 00:41:01.259]  Encourage others to get them while you still can.
[00:41:01.699 --> 00:41:02.220]  1776coin.com.
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:02.920]  All right.
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.080]  Alistair in Australia.
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:04.940]  First caller.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.560]  Thanks for calling.
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:05.920]  Go ahead.
[00:41:07.781 --> 00:41:08.801]  Hi, Alex.
[00:41:08.841 --> 00:41:09.461]  Can you hear me clear?
[00:41:09.541 --> 00:41:10.021]  I can, brother.
[00:41:10.041 --> 00:41:10.221]  Go ahead.
[00:41:11.761 --> 00:41:13.883]  Hi, yeah, thanks for getting me through quickly.
[00:41:13.943 --> 00:41:19.187]  It's four o'clock here in Melbourne, so it's late, and I understand your stress, Alex.
[00:41:19.227 --> 00:41:21.368]  I can see where the stress is coming from.
[00:41:21.528 --> 00:41:26.712]  I've been listening to your show for a long time, and you bear a heavy burden, but you shrug it off impressively.
[00:41:27.313 --> 00:41:35.479]  So anyway, I just wanted to get to some of the things that's been going on in Melbourne, because this is the heartland of the Great Reset.
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:41.203]  I've actually ordered your book on the Great Reset, which I'm patiently waiting to arrive.
[00:41:42.271 --> 00:41:48.381]  But we had two years of lockdown here and I was working at a supermarket which was one of the only businesses that remained open.
[00:41:49.382 --> 00:41:56.453]  And I was there on the front lines watching toilet paper go off the shelves and people going crazy with masks.
[00:41:57.262 --> 00:41:58.963]  And you were dead on about everything that was going on.
[00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:00.924]  You lived through the beta test of Marshall Law.
[00:42:00.944 --> 00:42:02.985]  Steve Bannon's in six minutes, but stay there.
[00:42:03.605 --> 00:42:04.546]  He's on at five after.
[00:42:04.566 --> 00:42:06.347]  I'm going to come right back to you, Alistair.
[00:42:06.367 --> 00:42:13.570]  I want to give you the floor to let people know, because when you said Melbourne is ground zero for the model of the world, Klaus Schwab admits it.
[00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:14.671]  You are the beta test.
[00:42:15.051 --> 00:42:18.072]  Australia today, the world tomorrow.
[00:42:18.192 --> 00:42:19.253]  Don't hang up, Alistair.
[00:42:19.273 --> 00:42:20.573]  I know it's four in the morning.
[00:42:20.593 --> 00:42:25.196]  Stay right there, back in two minutes with Alistair, and then we'll have Bannon on for 25 minutes, and then your calls.
[00:42:26.121 --> 00:42:27.683]  We're taking a ton of your calls today.
[00:42:27.703 --> 00:42:30.166]  We'll take calls for at least an hour and a half after that.
[00:42:30.546 --> 00:42:31.487]  Can't wait to take your calls.
[00:42:31.507 --> 00:42:32.048]  They're amazing.
[00:42:32.068 --> 00:42:39.068]  Stay with us.
[00:42:39.068 --> 00:42:46.068]  [Music]
[00:42:46.068 --> 00:42:49.068]  Look around you.
[00:42:49.292 --> 00:42:53.653]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[00:42:54.294 --> 00:42:57.495]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[00:42:58.195 --> 00:43:06.979]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I can steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[00:43:07.519 --> 00:43:12.521]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[00:43:13.181 --> 00:43:16.783]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[00:43:17.643 --> 00:43:20.308]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[00:43:20.749 --> 00:43:26.699]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:27.881]  It's unsustainable.
[00:43:28.322 --> 00:43:29.544]  So please, visit.
[00:43:30.423 --> 00:43:32.423]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[00:43:32.423 --> 00:43:38.823]   SaveInfoWars.com, where you can make straight donations, five, ten, fifty, a hundred dollars, whatever you can,
[00:43:38.823 --> 00:43:40.623]  so that I can continue to persevere.
[00:43:40.623 --> 00:43:43.522]   I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[00:43:43.522 --> 00:43:44.823]  Thank you for your support.
[00:43:44.823 --> 00:43:47.423]  Wouldn't be here without you. SaveInfoWars.com.
[00:43:47.423 --> 00:43:50.923]   Steve Bannon with huge news is coming up in the next segment.
[00:43:50.923 --> 00:43:52.423]  I want to give Alistair the floor.
[00:43:52.376 --> 00:44:08.754]  He's in Ground Zero, Australia, to describe what he witnessed and what he saw under almost two years of World Economic Forum, UN martial law, the model of their takeover plan, or the war for the world, as a great Australian coined the term.
[00:44:09.035 --> 00:44:09.936]  Go ahead, Alistair.
[00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:12.569]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:13.429 --> 00:44:14.950]  It's all happening right here.
[00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:21.431]  And we know this because Moderna has a seven-year contract to manufacture all their vaccines here.
[00:44:21.951 --> 00:44:33.653]  So even though we're only just letting go of some workplace restrictions, my workplace unfortunately has not dropped their restrictions, so I still have not been hired back at my job.
[00:44:35.134 --> 00:44:43.115]   But I've seen Protests, epi-spray, ghost highways, curfews, medical violence, everything.
[00:44:43.436 --> 00:44:47.979]  The Great Reset does not look happy.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.963]  Klaus Schwab says we will have nothing, own nothing, and we will like it.
[00:44:53.584 --> 00:44:54.184]  That's not true.
[00:44:54.665 --> 00:44:55.506]  We're not going to like it.
[00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:57.027]  We're going to be very depressed.
[00:44:58.528 --> 00:45:05.634]  Melbourne was the most liveable city in the world until a couple of years ago, and it's officially out of the top five.
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:12.904]  So that just goes to show you what the Great Reset looks like for your cities and for your country.
[00:45:12.924 --> 00:45:26.192]  So I only hope America can keep that flame going for a little bit longer because we're in trouble if you guys don't keep the fort.
[00:45:30.035 --> 00:45:31.035]  I agree.
[00:45:31.115 --> 00:45:33.437]  Describe what it was like living at Ground Zero of the New World Order.
[00:45:35.949 --> 00:45:38.010]  It was dull.
[00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:40.331]  Every day was the same.
[00:45:40.891 --> 00:45:45.933]  Like I said, I was working at a supermarket, so I was one of the few people that could interact with the public.
[00:45:46.453 --> 00:45:50.275]  And the public were only interacting with people like me.
[00:45:50.775 --> 00:45:52.176]  No one was seeing each other, you know?
[00:45:52.716 --> 00:46:02.900]  The first day when I saw the masks at the supermarket, you could feel in the air that we'd lost something, that there was a deadness in the air.
[00:46:03.889 --> 00:46:06.571]  And it's never really, it's never really left.
[00:46:07.311 --> 00:46:10.153]  So it's really incredible.
[00:46:10.173 --> 00:46:12.034]  I mean, we definitely had the worst of it.
[00:46:12.394 --> 00:46:15.396]  But like you say, this is, this was the target point.
[00:46:15.416 --> 00:46:17.257]  I mean, we've got the COVID camps ready.
[00:46:17.677 --> 00:46:25.702]  We've got the factories ready to manufacture new vaccines, more RNA based technology, and whatever else they want to introduce.
[00:46:25.942 --> 00:46:34.821]   So I only hope that when The oncoming collapse, which you've been predicting, and I'm afraid you're probably right again, Alex.
[00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:42.672]  We can rebuild something out of it, because unfortunately I think it is going to get quite bad over the next couple of years.
[00:46:42.812 --> 00:46:43.432]  Well, that's right.
[00:46:43.512 --> 00:46:46.293]  They want to initiate the collapse in their own words and bring in their control.
[00:46:46.313 --> 00:46:52.215]  No, we have to point out they initiated the collapse and put them in prison and stop their great reset and their Build Back Better program.
[00:46:52.255 --> 00:46:59.437]  But that feeling you describe of heaviness and no fun anymore and scarcity as a name, it's called tyranny.
[00:47:00.097 --> 00:47:01.298]  It's called slavery.
[00:47:01.698 --> 00:47:03.139]  It's called the New World Order.
[00:47:03.179 --> 00:47:04.299]  It's called the Great Reset.
[00:47:04.699 --> 00:47:05.640]  And we must reject it.
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:07.340]  There's a war for the world happening now.
[00:47:07.901 --> 00:47:09.522]  And Australia is the epicenter.
[00:47:12.363 --> 00:47:13.203]  That's absolutely right.
[00:47:13.663 --> 00:47:14.324]  Yeah, dead on.
[00:47:14.724 --> 00:47:19.206]  And to be honest, I think you're doing the strongest work.
[00:47:19.606 --> 00:47:25.829]   And you've been 100% correct about everything for this past couple of years.
[00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:29.270]  As soon as I saw toilet paper flying off the shelves, I knew the man to turn to.
[00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:30.351]  Alex Jones.
[00:47:30.591 --> 00:47:34.632]  And you were hitting the nail on the head from the get-go, so I hope you keep doing it, man.
[00:47:34.652 --> 00:47:35.692]  We're trying.
[00:47:35.712 --> 00:47:37.013]  It's only you that keeps us on air.
[00:47:37.033 --> 00:47:37.873]  God bless you, brother.
[00:47:38.713 --> 00:47:41.175]  We've been shipping the books out within 24 hours of the orders.
[00:47:41.716 --> 00:47:46.360]  Obviously, they were pre-ordered for a month, so it was back-order because people couldn't ship it until the book got here.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:52.445]  But since the book came in, it's been shipping the day after, so they may have robbed it out of customs.
[00:47:52.845 --> 00:47:58.009]  But even if that happens, you can still get the digital copy at Amazon.com.
[00:47:58.350 --> 00:47:59.651]  God bless you, and thanks for the support.
[00:48:01.232 --> 00:48:09.735]  All right, Steve Bannon has been on fire for a long time, and he was the brain trust, really, that got Trump to do what he did against the globalists.
[00:48:09.835 --> 00:48:10.416]  It's really true.
[00:48:10.736 --> 00:48:11.416]  Him and Stephen Miller.
[00:48:12.516 --> 00:48:15.878]  And he has really been calling it like he sees it.
[00:48:15.898 --> 00:48:16.638]  He's been dead on.
[00:48:16.658 --> 00:48:18.459]  So we're going to cover the waterfront.
[00:48:18.479 --> 00:48:25.802]  I'm going to try to just shut up when he joins us in one minute and just let him roll for the next two segments and lay out what he sees happening in these midterms.
[00:48:26.562 --> 00:48:31.548]  Any tricks the deep state has up their sleeves and what we can do to take control of this country back in our hands.
[00:48:31.568 --> 00:48:32.650]  Because we have no choice.
[00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:34.792]  Submission is total slavery.
[00:48:35.513 --> 00:48:40.940]  Alright, Steve Bannon, really the brain trust behind the four great years we had of Trump.
[00:48:42.742 --> 00:48:53.045]  He's here with us for just two segments, and we're going to give him the floor to give his incredible analysis he's been doing daily on his own show, seven days a week, The War Room, of these midterms of 28 Days Out.
[00:48:53.405 --> 00:48:56.526]  And the numbers, even in their skewed polls, show Republican landslide.
[00:48:56.886 --> 00:49:00.287]  So what is the deep state going to do to grab victory from the jaws of defeat?
[00:49:00.307 --> 00:49:01.547]  So Steve, I'm going to give you the floor.
[00:49:01.907 --> 00:49:02.708]  You're hosting the show.
[00:49:02.748 --> 00:49:03.648]  Thanks for being here with us.
[00:49:05.117 --> 00:49:06.438]  Well look, glad to have you back.
[00:49:07.018 --> 00:49:12.021]  As much as they try to take you out of this important midterm, Alex, you're back and your voice is needed more than ever.
[00:49:12.041 --> 00:49:12.561]  And here's why.
[00:49:12.982 --> 00:49:14.663]  You know, there's two things going on concurrently.
[00:49:14.723 --> 00:49:22.847]  Number one, obviously the tectonic plate shift of the common sense of the American people awakening to what's going on in the math at every level.
[00:49:22.947 --> 00:49:32.593]  It's school board, state legislature, your county commission, election boards, medical boards, all the way up through the House and the Senate is shifting dramatically.
[00:49:32.613 --> 00:49:34.074]  And I can talk about a few of those numbers.
[00:49:34.714 --> 00:49:38.613]  and what they're trying to do to thwart that.
[00:49:38.613 --> 00:49:43.553]   But simultaneously, I mean, go to the homepage of Drudge Today, and this is kind of where
[00:49:43.553 --> 00:49:45.774]  your specialty is.
[00:49:45.774 --> 00:49:49.774]  They clearly know they're going to be blown out of power.
[00:49:49.774 --> 00:49:55.854]   And I mean, in the House, in the Senate, in just everywhere up and down, a historic, a
[00:49:56.268 --> 00:50:04.231]  We actually going to destroy the Democratic Party as a national political institution, but then simultaneously look at drudge and drudge is really now become the establishments.
[00:50:05.409 --> 00:50:06.610]  You know, megaphone.
[00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:09.651]  If you look at that, it's a tale of two countries.
[00:50:09.872 --> 00:50:18.036]  Right now, the people in the United States are worried about what's going on locally with inflation, with crime, with immigration, all of it, and the votes are showing that.
[00:50:18.336 --> 00:50:32.203]  At the same time, the elites, you see on Drudge, have metastasized the situation in Ukraine to try to be, look, people said Alex Jones is a conspiracy theory guy, Alex Jones is a wingnut, he's a nutcase.
[00:50:32.955 --> 00:50:41.023]  But hey, you I think you were on my show a month ago or six weeks ago when you said, hey, they're going to be some sort of cyber attacks.
[00:50:41.323 --> 00:50:44.186]  They're going to say these cyber attacks all came from Russia.
[00:50:44.726 --> 00:50:49.751]  And the other day, you know, was Associated Press, you know, said the cyber attacks at the airport.
[00:50:49.831 --> 00:50:51.212]  Oh, by then the third paragraph.
[00:50:51.352 --> 00:50:52.954]  Oh, yeah, the Russians are responsible.
[00:50:53.514 --> 00:50:55.997]  So I think that we have to be on guard.
[00:50:57.088 --> 00:51:00.509]  For something that the establishment is going to try to pull, the Uniparty.
[00:51:00.729 --> 00:51:09.331]  And the reason is that, particularly the Radical Democrats and the Globalists, they understand that we're about to take control of real power.
[00:51:09.351 --> 00:51:15.213]  The House of Representatives, the appropriations process, and look, we're going to have a lot of fighting, infighting afterwards.
[00:51:15.273 --> 00:51:16.273]  It's not going to be perfect.
[00:51:16.673 --> 00:51:22.335]  There are a lot of rhinos on here, a lot of people that are, you know, still Globalists, but we got to win.
[00:51:22.375 --> 00:51:28.336]   We don't have any choice, but if we don't win, This November, we don't want in four weeks from today, the country's over.
[00:51:28.456 --> 00:51:35.618]  There's no doubt about that, where these radicals are going, so it's... Well, please repeat, because I watch your show, not just when I'm on it, I watch it every day.
[00:51:36.218 --> 00:51:50.701]  Repeat the analysis of the elections and why I agree with you that it's a landslide, seismic shift, but as you're saying, the deep state's going to pull something, obviously ratcheting up the war, all of it, distract from the economy, imploding borders, but what do you, with your research, think they're going to pull?
[00:51:52.236 --> 00:51:53.117]  Well, I don't know.
[00:51:53.197 --> 00:51:54.517]  I mean, this is kind of your expertise.
[00:51:54.557 --> 00:51:59.060]  I think it's something clearly they are the United States government.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:05.724]  The Biden administration is goading these guys on, at least in people's mind, something about some nuclear Armageddon.
[00:52:06.545 --> 00:52:10.507]  And in the Defense Department, people have come out and said there's no difference in threat.
[00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:16.131]  You know, we haven't gone up the threat scale at all, but they continue to talk about this.
[00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:20.672]  Look, the Ukrainian situation is a border dispute in eastern Ukraine.
[00:52:21.212 --> 00:52:22.393]  Russian-speaking Ukraine.
[00:52:22.513 --> 00:52:27.835]  It is a border dispute that is not even central to the national security interest of Europe.
[00:52:27.875 --> 00:52:29.556]  And you can tell this by the voters in Europe.
[00:52:29.576 --> 00:52:41.701]  The voters in Europe right now, whether it's in the UK, France, Italy, and Germany, are starting to revolt against all this money and the lack of energy resources coming from Russia, particularly as we go into a cold winter.
[00:52:41.721 --> 00:52:45.403]  So the voters there are starting to understand this after all this propaganda.
[00:52:45.903 --> 00:52:54.531]  What is shocking to me, as we're seeing numbers, and Alex, you should know right now, I think this afternoon on the show we're going to talk about maybe 50, 60, 70 House seats.
[00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:56.032]  These are all in play.
[00:52:56.412 --> 00:53:04.079]  There's articles today in the New York Times about nine seats, nine congressional seats in New York that are right at almost dead even right now.
[00:53:04.539 --> 00:53:16.130]   You've got, we're in Oregon, we're in California, down in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas, as you know, the Democrats are pulling funding out of those Hispanic Congressional districts in South Texas.
[00:53:16.591 --> 00:53:18.232]  We are running the tables right now.
[00:53:18.312 --> 00:53:19.874]  The reason is people have had a belly full of this.
[00:53:19.894 --> 00:53:26.281]  They've had a belly full of the inflation, the crime, the invasion of the southern border, the cultural Marxism in the school.
[00:53:26.321 --> 00:53:28.804]  They're from Rhode Island.
[00:53:28.844 --> 00:53:29.945]  Rhode Island, too.
[00:53:30.606 --> 00:53:33.649]  We haven't controlled Rhode Island, too, since 1992 and over 30 years.
[00:53:35.723 --> 00:53:40.584]  A Chinese man, Feng, a guy named Feng, is up six points on one of the Golden Boys of the Democratic Party.
[00:53:41.125 --> 00:53:43.745]  In Connecticut, we're up in a couple of congressional districts.
[00:53:43.785 --> 00:53:45.106]  These are deep blue states.
[00:53:45.186 --> 00:53:49.907]  Maryland, Connecticut, Oregon, Rhode Island, deep blue states in deep blue districts.
[00:53:50.327 --> 00:53:50.927]  We're now winning.
[00:53:51.367 --> 00:53:54.328]  And so they've got to do something to thwart that.
[00:53:54.969 --> 00:53:57.529]  The media hype right now about we're dangerous.
[00:53:57.989 --> 00:53:59.990]  This is all a bunch of fascists coming to power.
[00:54:00.894 --> 00:54:08.160]  And you can see that out in the West, in places like Arizona and Nevada, with Jim Marshall and Secretary of State Mark Fincham, particularly Carrie Lake.
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:13.704]  They've identified Carrie Lake as their most dangerous and existential threat to their system.
[00:54:13.724 --> 00:54:17.607]  She's like Sarah Palin with a little more charm, right?
[00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:19.769]  And so they're scared to death of her.
[00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:25.333]  They say she's the Trump that's been trained by television, really broadcast news for 25 years.
[00:54:25.773 --> 00:54:26.834]  These people are desperate.
[00:54:27.254 --> 00:54:29.535]  And now we're taking power all the way from the school boards.
[00:54:29.815 --> 00:54:34.158]  This is really the destruction of the Democratic Party as a national political institution.
[00:54:34.498 --> 00:54:39.220]  It'll still be very powerful in places like Austin, Texas, these university towns on the coast.
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:47.104]  It'll have tremendous resources, still control Wall Street and the global corporations, but in the heartland of this country and even in the suburbs, we will have broken it.
[00:54:47.768 --> 00:54:54.753]  I just don't believe that they're going to sit there, and particularly when I see the news today, you know, the Saudis came out about this negotiation about OPEC.
[00:54:54.854 --> 00:55:07.964]  OPEC had let them know after Biden came over there and kowtowed to them, not only were they not going to increase by a million barrels, there probably was going to be a cut, and with the Biden administration, this is the New York Times reporting it, they begged them to please wait a month, just wait to after.
[00:55:07.984 --> 00:55:15.190]   The problem with the oil and the Americans Having to pay more and being their lifestyles change.
[00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:18.053]  It was please just wait to after the midterm election.
[00:55:18.113 --> 00:55:19.955]  So these people are desperate.
[00:55:19.995 --> 00:55:23.438]  They understand Biden's administration ends on the evening of the eighth.
[00:55:24.033 --> 00:55:26.034]  That impeachment hearings will start next year.
[00:55:26.074 --> 00:55:27.075]  Garland will be impeached.
[00:55:27.095 --> 00:55:28.176]  She'll be thrown out of office.
[00:55:28.216 --> 00:55:29.297]  Mayorkas, obviously.
[00:55:29.437 --> 00:55:34.076]   Chris Wray will be fired. I totally agree. So let's war game this. You say it's my forte, but it's also yours.
[00:55:34.076 --> 00:55:39.517]   This is the real world. What will they pull? I think a cyber attack. They can blame on Russia. A bigger one. A
[00:55:39.517 --> 00:55:40.317]  power outage.
[00:55:40.317 --> 00:55:43.597]  Provocateurs. Some crazy white supremacists to do something.
[00:55:43.597 --> 00:55:48.796]   Expand the war with Russia where it's so bad they can suspend the election. I mean, they're totally
[00:55:48.796 --> 00:55:54.796]   desperate. They've shown that they never give up. They only double down. So from here, I don't see
[00:55:54.796 --> 00:55:56.796]  what they won't do, really.
[00:55:56.856 --> 00:55:58.117]  Well, two mystery hits.
[00:55:58.217 --> 00:56:00.099]  One is on the pipeline, the other is on the bridge.
[00:56:00.519 --> 00:56:06.144]  There are people out there trying to escalate this war rapidly, right?
[00:56:06.164 --> 00:56:07.625]  Trying to escalate this war rapidly.
[00:56:07.664 --> 00:56:12.224]   We also have reports, and this is from mainstream reporting, that we've got paramilitary and
[00:56:12.224 --> 00:56:18.583]   maybe even some special forces like in Vietnam already in Ukraine maybe guiding some of the
[00:56:18.583 --> 00:56:22.423]   -- I have personal friends that are in Army Special Operations that have been there the
[00:56:22.423 --> 00:56:23.744]  whole time directing the troops.
[00:56:23.744 --> 00:56:28.904]   So let me just say, it's a fact U.S. troops are there and dying, not just contractors.
[00:56:28.904 --> 00:56:32.664]  U.S. regular Army are fighting and dying against Russians.
[00:56:32.664 --> 00:56:34.864]  We are at war with Russia.
[00:56:35.596 --> 00:56:48.823]  We're with Russia, and if they want to move on it, because they understand after we went on the 8th, there's a huge element of our movement that want to get to the, tell people, and even Trump's picked up, get to the negotiating table, let's figure out a deal, stop, you know, don't escalate anymore.
[00:56:48.843 --> 00:56:49.664]  Even the Pope's saying that.
[00:56:49.764 --> 00:56:51.105]  Even Henry Kissinger's saying that.
[00:56:51.365 --> 00:56:55.007]  So if Kissinger's not in charge, who's in charge going towards World War III?
[00:56:56.556 --> 00:57:00.997]  Well, right now, if you look at every aspect of this, it's the American government.
[00:57:01.077 --> 00:57:05.799]  It is Biden and the guys around him, Tony Blinken, Sullivan.
[00:57:06.079 --> 00:57:10.920]  We just broke today, they had the voice of Bernie Sanders talking about they sent the CIA.
[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:20.483]  This is Bernie Sanders said, yeah, we sent the CIA down to Brazil back in the summer to tell Bolsonaro that we didn't want anything, we didn't want him continue to talk about election fraud.
[00:57:20.903 --> 00:57:23.984]  They're admitting this now, sending the CIA to Brazil.
[00:57:24.745 --> 00:57:28.907]  I think the national security apparatus and national intelligence apparatus is out of control.
[00:57:28.947 --> 00:57:31.508]  Look, it clearly needs to be investigated, but deeply.
[00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:36.930]  They understand they've only got four weeks, because Tuesday night, four weeks from now, they're going to know they got blown out.
[00:57:37.905 --> 00:57:38.185]  I agree.
[00:57:38.245 --> 00:57:41.707]  Final segment coming up with the one and only Steve Bannon, warroom.org.
[00:57:42.087 --> 00:57:43.668]  And Steve, you work as much as I do.
[00:57:43.728 --> 00:57:45.508]  You're on different times all the time.
[00:57:45.789 --> 00:57:47.129]  How often are you doing your show?
[00:57:47.149 --> 00:57:47.909]  I know it's every day.
[00:57:47.929 --> 00:57:50.911]  I catch the clips and sometimes I actually have time to watch the full show.
[00:57:51.271 --> 00:57:53.572]  But where do we find the war room?
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:58:06.045]  I guess it's as easy as warroom.org or on Real America's Voice for two hours in the morning, 10 to noon, Eastern Daylight Time, two hours in the afternoon, 5 to 7, and then Saturday mornings, 10 to noon, which you've been so gracious to join us in.
[00:58:06.085 --> 00:58:13.409]  So, no, we're, I don't know, 26 hours a week or something like that, but it's, and we go up online on Getter a lot, so we're 24-7.
[00:58:13.429 --> 00:58:15.950]  We got nothing better to do, Alex, so this is our life.
[00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:16.990]  Hey, history's happening now.
[00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:17.971]  We'll be right back with Steve Bannon.
[00:58:19.255 --> 00:58:21.658]  Look, the currency that I traffic in is truth.
[00:58:21.758 --> 00:58:22.839]  Doesn't mean I don't make mistakes.
[00:58:22.879 --> 00:58:24.801]  Sometimes I've made plenty, but never on purpose.
[00:58:25.802 --> 00:58:27.424]  And my accuracy rate is really about 95%.
[00:58:27.764 --> 00:58:32.289]  I would say Steve Bannon's is about maybe even, you know, higher, maybe 98.
[00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:37.154]  But the point is, is that we're pro-America, we're pro-freedom, we love our families, we love you.
[00:58:37.174 --> 00:58:39.317]  Because if we're going to do well, your family's got to do well.
[00:58:40.046 --> 00:58:50.520]  And I don't want to get up here with gloom and doom in this final segment before I come back and take calls with Steve Bannon and try to scare people, but I had on my mind the financial collapse that's happening, and I asked him during the break, I said, what's your next topic?
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:51.661]  Because we hadn't talked before he came on.
[00:58:51.701 --> 00:58:56.607]  He said, serious financial Armageddon, basically, and how they're trying to hold it off.
[00:58:57.248 --> 00:58:59.191]  Until after the midterms blame Republicans.
[00:58:59.231 --> 00:59:07.922]  Now obviously nobody's going to buy that, but even JP Morgan, even Goldman Sachs, they're coming out criticizing Biden and trying to ban US oil exports.
[00:59:08.022 --> 00:59:15.371]  So there's real economic war happening, cutting off our pipelines, not just blowing up the Russian pipelines, and people are seeing through.
[00:59:16.312 --> 00:59:21.655]  Seeing through this, even at the Wall Street level, there's major fights happening, which shows you how much danger we're in.
[00:59:21.695 --> 00:59:28.440]  So, Steve, you've been a big financier, you've been a big investor in your own right, not just Naval history and all the rest of it.
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:33.523]  In the eight minutes we have left, how serious is this financial situation?
[00:59:34.966 --> 00:59:40.751]  This financial situation is more serious than 1929 to 1932 before the Great Depression.
[00:59:41.211 --> 00:59:49.237]  And the reason is the solution for the last time they got us in this problem, 2008, set up an entire infrastructure globally of zero negative interest rates.
[00:59:49.297 --> 00:59:53.681]  And now that they threw the gasoline in the fire of inflation, they don't know how to tame it.
[00:59:53.821 --> 01:00:00.486]   The way they're doing is raising interest rates across the world, and it's exposing All the issues in this global financial infrastructure.
[01:00:00.526 --> 01:00:07.111]  We have $300 trillion of debt throughout the world that's been able to be paid, Alex, because interest rates have been near zero.
[01:00:07.131 --> 01:00:09.953]  As interest rates start to spike, you're going to see a collapse all over.
[01:00:10.113 --> 01:00:11.133]  Don't take it from me.
[01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:17.518]  CNBC had this interview with Jamie Dimon, in which Jamie Dimon said, we're going to have a credit crisis.
[01:00:17.698 --> 01:00:18.338]  It's coming.
[01:00:18.779 --> 01:00:22.942]  And you're going to see either ETFs or these stocks, or he says, you're going to see countries.
[01:00:23.562 --> 01:00:31.327]  The reporter from CNBC didn't even ask a couple of basic follow-on questions, because I'm sure she had a producer in her ear saying, don't go there.
[01:00:31.627 --> 01:00:33.348]  We don't want to frighten the markets.
[01:00:34.148 --> 01:00:38.311]  Your audience should be, in particular your international audience, should be looking at this Bank of England situation.
[01:00:38.351 --> 01:00:43.649]   The Bank of England, because Liz Truss came out with this kind of plan that didn't make any sense, But they had to intervene.
[01:00:43.689 --> 01:00:52.072]  The Bank of England's had to intervene now three times in the gilts, which is the treasury equivalent of the British government, to keep it from collapsing.
[01:00:52.432 --> 01:01:05.417]  And the reason they're doing that is the pension funds own so many, and what they found out in these pension funds, they're highly leveraged, just not to hedge their risk, but to get higher returns, because in a zero interest rate world, they need to do it.
[01:01:05.837 --> 01:01:13.020]  These pension funds could implode and literally go out of business and really, you know, devastate the United Kingdom.
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:17.582]  And so there are so many problems we don't even know, and even the big financiers don't even know.
[01:01:17.642 --> 01:01:23.964]  In fact, Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JP Morgan says, hey, there's a lot out there that we don't know that we're going to find out.
[01:01:24.024 --> 01:01:28.306]  Remember, the financial collapse in 2008 came when they kicked Lehman into bankruptcy.
[01:01:28.866 --> 01:01:29.987]  And I totally agree.
[01:01:29.827 --> 01:01:32.427]  and control the commercial paper market globally.
[01:01:32.427 --> 01:01:34.067]  They were like the trader in it.
[01:01:34.067 --> 01:01:37.467]   That led to a financial devastation, as you remember, Alex, that we really have never
[01:01:37.467 --> 01:01:40.547]   recovered from, except to have the Federal Reserve print money.
[01:01:40.547 --> 01:01:41.547]  And I totally agree.
[01:01:41.547 --> 01:01:46.346]   How does the collapsing Chinese market in real estate tie into this?
[01:01:47.221 --> 01:01:48.982]  I mean, the Chinese right now trying to prop that.
[01:01:49.002 --> 01:01:54.165]  That was one of the reasons Xi at the 20th Party Congress is trying to take total political and military power.
[01:01:54.185 --> 01:02:00.069]  And he's going to try to get people pointed at Taiwan, that we got to reunify Taiwan and essentially bring down the West.
[01:02:00.389 --> 01:02:00.890]  This is the thing.
[01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:08.515]  Remember, in 2008, just like Biden's using an escalated Ukraine crisis as a financial diversion, China's going to use Taiwan.
[01:02:09.494 --> 01:02:17.000]  You look at that front page of Drudge and that's what the Biden administration is putting, that's the information war, as you know better than anybody, that's the information war.
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:19.422]  They're trying to set the predicate in people's minds.
[01:02:19.462 --> 01:02:23.705]  That's right, the Drudge Report, I'm sad to say it, is the mouth of Obama and Biden and the globalists.
[01:02:23.725 --> 01:02:24.525]  You want to know what they think?
[01:02:24.566 --> 01:02:25.066]  Just look at it.
[01:02:25.266 --> 01:02:26.287]  They're betting everything on war.
[01:02:27.495 --> 01:02:27.875]  Look at that.
[01:02:28.115 --> 01:02:29.376]  Zelensky pleads for more help.
[01:02:29.896 --> 01:02:32.577]  NATO deterrent exercise next week.
[01:02:32.917 --> 01:02:34.558]  They're going to try to build this up rapidly.
[01:02:34.578 --> 01:02:37.799]  And so people have to be on... We're not conspiracy theory, guys.
[01:02:37.859 --> 01:02:38.480]  It's right there.
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:39.640]  You have to be on guidance.
[01:02:40.321 --> 01:02:47.524]  Why would this be happening at the exact moment we're about to run the tables and take real political power in the House and the Senate all the way down to state?
[01:02:47.804 --> 01:02:50.865]  We could flip Nevada, New Mexico and Minnesota.
[01:02:51.185 --> 01:02:52.386]  The state legislature is there.
[01:02:52.426 --> 01:02:55.107]  This is an overwhelming victory for MAGA.
[01:02:55.507 --> 01:02:56.467]  From MAGA.
[01:02:56.627 --> 01:02:58.308]  Shouldn't Putin be smart and pull back?
[01:02:58.348 --> 01:03:00.529]  He's being goaded, giving them just what they want.
[01:03:02.609 --> 01:03:05.250]  Listen, who knows how they're making decisions over there right now.
[01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.871]  You just don't know.
[01:03:05.911 --> 01:03:16.134]  They've made some pretty, as you know, because you know warfare as well as anybody, they've made some pretty bad mistakes in this war, particularly if it was about the eastern provinces.
[01:03:16.174 --> 01:03:17.394]  They made some pretty big mistakes.
[01:03:17.755 --> 01:03:19.035]  Who knows how they're making decisions.
[01:03:19.075 --> 01:03:22.036]  One thing I will tell you, the Russian people don't give up.
[01:03:22.496 --> 01:03:24.998]  Don't worry about the guys around, you know, the KGB people, right?
[01:03:25.018 --> 01:03:26.239]  The Russian people don't give up.
[01:03:26.299 --> 01:03:34.966]  And so folks got to understand that backing Zelensky and these Ukrainians, which is the third most corrupt government in the world, has been a fool's errand.
[01:03:35.026 --> 01:03:36.948]  And the people of Europe are waking up to this.
[01:03:37.048 --> 01:03:37.829]  Italy knows that.
[01:03:38.269 --> 01:03:39.050]  France knows that.
[01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:40.130]  The German people know it.
[01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:41.191]  The British people know it.
[01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:43.693]  So the people over there see exactly what's going on.
[01:03:44.054 --> 01:03:50.479]  I'm just afraid they're going to try to use some smokescreen now to try to thwart our massive victory on November 8th.
[01:03:50.859 --> 01:03:51.700]  No, I totally agree.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:59.347]  And if you see the pre-programming of mainstream media, and of the Biden administration, and of Hillary and Obama, and now the WEF, it's cyber attack.
[01:03:59.367 --> 01:04:00.768]  It wasn't hard to predict that a month ago.
[01:04:01.249 --> 01:04:02.210]  They're betting it all on it.
[01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:08.616]  And I think what we saw with the airport attacks yesterday, with the cyber attack, is a beta test to see if we can somehow blame Russia for that.
[01:04:08.676 --> 01:04:09.697]  I just don't see it working.
[01:04:11.395 --> 01:04:17.338]  Well, as long as you're on watch and now back off of getting shut down in Connecticut and Texas, yes.
[01:04:17.398 --> 01:04:21.099]  Because you called it, I think on our show four or five weeks ago, you said exactly what's going to happen.
[01:04:21.359 --> 01:04:25.261]  There's going to be cyber attacks on our infrastructure and they're going to blame Russia.
[01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:26.562]  What happened?
[01:04:26.582 --> 01:04:31.024]  17 cyber attacks and immediately they blame Russia with no evidence put forward for that.
[01:04:31.044 --> 01:04:32.964]  So, I think people just have to be aware.
[01:04:33.024 --> 01:04:38.726]   That's why we are getting so many volunteers into the counting rooms to make sure they don't steal this election.
[01:04:38.726 --> 01:04:44.726]   Right now, you saw in Colorado today, that the Secretary of State inadvertently sent 30,000
[01:04:44.726 --> 01:04:47.726]  voter registrations to non-citizens in Colorado.
[01:04:47.726 --> 01:04:50.726]  They said, "Oops, it was just a glitch in the software."
[01:04:50.726 --> 01:04:54.726]   With two minutes left, what else do you want to impart to this audience?
[01:04:54.726 --> 01:04:56.726]  I think just be on watch.
[01:04:56.553 --> 01:04:57.133]  You've got to listen.
[01:04:57.253 --> 01:05:02.596]  Everybody in your audience, your activists, the Walmart, we have, this is time now to put our differences aside.
[01:05:02.756 --> 01:05:03.876]  Everybody come together.
[01:05:04.197 --> 01:05:08.699]  You know, you've got to get, you can be a force multiplier and push out the information from these shows.
[01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:10.580]  And as importantly, own your vote.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.481]  Also volunteer to do something.
[01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:16.143]  Get out to vote or get into accounting room as a poll worker.
[01:05:16.543 --> 01:05:20.826]  Okay, as a poll worker inside the room, this is the way we make sure this thing's not stolen.
[01:05:20.846 --> 01:05:22.047]  And don't think we have it in the bag.
[01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:23.648]  Sure, all the numbers show a landslide.
[01:05:23.708 --> 01:05:25.729]  We've got to override the fraud with even bigger numbers.
[01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:29.932]  And just in closing, I want to commend Trump for being a peacemaker and calling for peace.
[01:05:30.452 --> 01:05:35.716]  I mean, there should be some type of armistice, some type of ceasefire, and I think Trump should be the guy to broker it.
[01:05:36.707 --> 01:05:37.428]  Plus his arc.
[01:05:37.568 --> 01:05:39.611]  Remember, he didn't start out great on this, right?
[01:05:39.631 --> 01:05:41.253]  There was a little happy talk about Ukraine.
[01:05:41.293 --> 01:05:42.254]  He's come a long way.
[01:05:42.315 --> 01:05:47.201]  And right now, if you had to put anybody in a room to make a deal, I would say President Trump would be the guy.
[01:05:47.261 --> 01:05:47.742]  He's there.
[01:05:48.523 --> 01:06:00.356]   What he's talking about, about immediate de-escalation, Get into the room, have, you know, Turkey, have some guys from Europe, have the Ukrainians, obviously the Russians, have somebody like Trump in there that can bring people together.
[01:06:00.596 --> 01:06:01.297]  Let's cut a deal.
[01:06:01.317 --> 01:06:10.446]  You're going to have a lot less dead women and children in Ukraine, and you're not going to have this thing metastasized, which could already go to biological, chemical, or nuclear warfare.
[01:06:11.576 --> 01:06:13.957]  Well, Steve, they're trying to put you in prison.
[01:06:14.457 --> 01:06:16.338]  They're trying to put me under the jail as well.
[01:06:16.378 --> 01:06:25.000]  Everybody should pray for you and support you, but I know what you really want is folks to share the word about warroom.org, the incredible videos, live reports, and articles you're posting.
[01:06:26.161 --> 01:06:27.981]  I tell you what, Alex, you know what I want the audience to do?
[01:06:28.081 --> 01:06:28.942]  Pray for our enemies.
[01:06:29.182 --> 01:06:32.043]  They're the ones that are going to need prayers, not Alex Jones and Steve Bannon.
[01:06:32.883 --> 01:06:33.423]  Well, you're right.
[01:06:33.463 --> 01:06:34.483]  Our enemies are collapsing.
[01:06:34.503 --> 01:06:35.264]  We're the tip of the spear.
[01:06:35.284 --> 01:06:36.224]  Steve Bannon, thanks for the time.
[01:06:37.182 --> 01:06:38.023]  Thanks, brother.
[01:06:38.023 --> 01:06:38.862]  All right.
[01:06:38.862 --> 01:06:39.702]  Wow, that was powerful.
[01:06:39.702 --> 01:06:42.942]   Okay, I promise, folks, your calls are just a few minutes away.
[01:06:42.942 --> 01:06:44.222]  We're going right to your calls.
[01:06:44.222 --> 01:06:46.382]  Bam, bam, bam, bam.
[01:06:46.382 --> 01:06:48.983]   So just no matter how great you are, 'cause you're all awesome,
[01:06:48.983 --> 01:06:51.942]   I'm gonna give each person a minute and a half, and I'm hanging up on you.
[01:06:51.942 --> 01:06:55.623]   I'll give like a 20-second comment, but I love it when I'm tuning to rebroadcast
[01:06:55.623 --> 01:06:56.943]  and I hear me taking like 30 calls.
[01:06:56.943 --> 01:06:58.222]  It sounds so good.
[01:06:58.222 --> 01:06:59.742]  You guys bring up such amazing points.
[01:06:59.742 --> 01:07:00.583]  We're coming right back to you.
[01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:01.422]  Stay with us.
[01:07:01.422 --> 01:07:09.541]   All right, I'm taking a ton of your phone calls in the next hour and a half, then we have a very special
[01:07:09.541 --> 01:07:13.742]  guest in the fourth hour today.
[01:07:13.742 --> 01:07:15.742]  today.
[01:07:15.976 --> 01:07:22.857]  But when we talk about the economy, we talk about war, we talk about the borders, we talk about all of it, the enemy is making their move right now.
[01:07:23.517 --> 01:07:31.599]  We are living in the time that the old-timers warned me about when I was a kid that was coming, and man, were they not absolutely dead on.
[01:07:32.319 --> 01:07:45.181]  There were such incredible patriots that built this country, and they knew who the enemy was, and they knew how to oppose it, and they held it off for so long, but now the enemy's making their move, but we're not being caught flat-footed, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:46.560]  All right.
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:49.183]  We're going to go to your phone calls.
[01:07:49.403 --> 01:07:52.926]  I just want to let everybody know that we've got the big mega super sale going right now.
[01:07:53.567 --> 01:07:54.988]  I've extended it until Thursday.
[01:07:55.048 --> 01:07:56.269]  It's got to stop on Thursday.
[01:07:56.790 --> 01:08:01.394]  And we'll still have X3 and we'll still have Atom and Mineral Fusion for sale for 50% off.
[01:08:01.474 --> 01:08:04.456]  That sale will continue for a few weeks while supplies last.
[01:08:05.217 --> 01:08:14.545]  Unfortunately, with supply chain breakdowns, we got most of the products back in the last few months, but we only had the money because we got behind, didn't have enough product to sell it, so we had to order only a little bit.
[01:08:15.065 --> 01:08:32.019]  We're running out of DNA Force Plus, we're running out of the D3 gummies with the calcium, and the 1100% of daily allowance organic vitamin C with zinc, Linus Pauling formula, and we're running out of the Brain Force Ultra and the Brain Force Plus, we're running out of all of it.
[01:08:32.839 --> 01:08:34.321]  But despite that, the sale goes.
[01:08:35.768 --> 01:08:41.091]  I guess we're doing a super long special emergency broadcast tomorrow until midnight with a bunch of special guests.
[01:08:41.732 --> 01:08:43.212]  So it will happen Thursday night.
[01:08:43.633 --> 01:08:46.074]  But those other two great products will continue on sale until they sell out.
[01:08:46.534 --> 01:08:49.196]  There's a run on iodine because people think it gives them radiation protection.
[01:08:49.516 --> 01:08:51.577]  Yes, a few of the main isotopes in a nuclear attack.
[01:08:51.958 --> 01:08:54.419]  It fills your thyroid with those so you don't absorb the bad isotopes.
[01:08:54.859 --> 01:08:56.020]  Yes, but it's not bulletproof.
[01:08:56.359 --> 01:08:57.960]  We don't sell it because of that.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.119]  Everybody's buying it because of that.
[01:08:59.119 --> 01:09:04.038]   We sell it for what it does to your energy, to your immune system, to your focus,
[01:09:04.038 --> 01:09:06.198]  to your clarity, to your libido.
[01:09:06.198 --> 01:09:09.038]   Takes two weeks to kick in on average, couple drops an hour to the tongue.
[01:09:09.038 --> 01:09:10.958]  Everybody should try X3.
[01:09:10.958 --> 01:09:12.319]  We've gotten it before and loved it.
[01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:13.878]  It's 50% off right now.
[01:09:13.878 --> 01:09:18.878]  X3, infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:09:18.878 --> 01:09:22.279]  888-253-3139.
[01:09:22.279 --> 01:09:26.038]   You can also get signed and unsigned copies of The Great Reset and War for the World
[01:09:26.038 --> 01:09:30.460]   off and on the number one book in the world right now at infowarestore.com.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:31.659]  And I just love Steve Bannon.
[01:09:31.659 --> 01:09:34.038]  I'm so glad he's part of the show.
[01:09:34.038 --> 01:09:37.179]   I can tell you the real credit goes to the listeners, everybody, for making it number one.
[01:09:37.179 --> 01:09:40.819]   But every time I go on, man, and that guy's got an incredible audience.
[01:09:40.819 --> 01:09:45.460]   Every time I go on, it goes to number one for a day or two, which is awesome.
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.779]  And then I get paid twice a year for the book sales.
[01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:51.380]   So three, four months, we should probably get a couple million dollar check,
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:52.618]  which is great.
[01:09:52.618 --> 01:09:57.979]   But with the bandwidth and the crew and the legal and all that, it takes that to stay in the fight.
[01:09:58.579 --> 01:10:00.463]  So that's great money built forward.
[01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.466]  Hope we get paid before a nuclear war.
[01:10:02.506 --> 01:10:05.291]  Hope the nuclear war doesn't happen, but currently...
[01:10:06.195 --> 01:10:08.816]  The support we get from the book sales is at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:10:08.836 --> 01:10:13.117]  Because we buy it from the publisher, then we make like $10 on the unsigned.
[01:10:13.837 --> 01:10:16.578]  The signed is a fundraiser, so we make like $80 on that.
[01:10:16.598 --> 01:10:22.720]  So if you really want to support us, get a signed copy, get part of the fundraiser, get the signed copies at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:23.320]  Okay, I'm done.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:24.100]  Done plugging.
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.861]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:10:26.301 --> 01:10:28.081]  Let's talk to, and we're going in the order they're received.
[01:10:28.521 --> 01:10:29.722]  D in Australia.
[01:10:31.883 --> 01:10:38.669]  Thank you, Alex, for having me on.
[01:10:38.729 --> 01:10:45.876]  Hey, you're doing a hell of a job, and you're specializing big time in the vaccination, and I want to thank you.
[01:10:46.276 --> 01:10:53.602]  But a subject that really needs to be covered, and don't take this in the wrong way, because first and foremost, we have to win the election.
[01:10:53.923 --> 01:10:55.124]  That's the bottom line.
[01:10:55.584 --> 01:11:12.998]  But for everything to work out, and all the hard work that you're doing, and all the patriots across America, for us to just sit and hand it over to Kevin McCarthy, Mitch McConnell, Elise Stefanik, and now we found out Jim Jordan is dirty, we're just wasting our time.
[01:11:13.259 --> 01:11:18.103]  I believe, and I know people... Isn't it sad that Jim Jordan now supports internet censorship?
[01:11:18.965 --> 01:11:22.725]  It's a shame. It's a damn shame in plain English.
[01:11:22.725 --> 01:11:28.724]   But, I mean, we gotta start letting these people know that, first of all, we're talking about
[01:11:28.724 --> 01:11:34.085]   leadership. Well, they're not doing anything. All we see is them going along with the war.
[01:11:34.085 --> 01:11:36.244]  We see them going along with the borders.
[01:11:36.244 --> 01:11:38.644]  So what do we do about the neocons and rhinos?
[01:11:38.774 --> 01:11:40.396]  And I agree with you, it's a balancing act.
[01:11:40.536 --> 01:11:44.779]  I cover the vaccine because we're beating it, we're stopping it, it's saving lives.
[01:11:44.899 --> 01:11:48.662]  But if we don't get the right party in and the right people in, they're going to bring it back.
[01:11:48.702 --> 01:11:52.866]  So you're right, we should be spending half our time on the election.
[01:11:53.732 --> 01:11:58.698]  And half our time trying to stop World War III, but then half our time on... Well, there's not half our time.
[01:11:58.999 --> 01:11:59.820]  The math doesn't do it.
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:00.981]  So how do we split that up?
[01:12:01.642 --> 01:12:03.264]  Are you saying the election's most important?
[01:12:03.684 --> 01:12:05.066]  World War III's most important?
[01:12:05.106 --> 01:12:06.428]  Or the poison shot's most important?
[01:12:06.448 --> 01:12:07.049]  What do you think?
[01:12:08.050 --> 01:12:11.132]  I believe we should be able to walk and chew bubblegum at the same time.
[01:12:11.232 --> 01:12:16.074]  We have to be out there winning, and we have to win the election, of course.
[01:12:16.154 --> 01:12:22.277]  But, you know, just like you said, if we hand this back over to these idiots, look at what they're doing.
[01:12:22.658 --> 01:12:25.019]  Look at the bills they're signing alone.
[01:12:25.539 --> 01:12:33.487]  They are part of the problem, and the only way to really clean the country up is to take the complete badness out of it.
[01:12:33.948 --> 01:12:40.975]  And the reality is, and you know this as well as I do, Alex, they're going after you for absolutely nothing.
[01:12:41.415 --> 01:12:44.258]  These people that are in Congress are criminals.
[01:12:44.338 --> 01:12:46.100]  The people in Senate are criminals.
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:49.422]  And this investigation stuff is a joke.
[01:12:49.862 --> 01:12:51.924]  We're going to have hearings.
[01:12:52.184 --> 01:12:54.686]  Oh yeah, hearings about the FBI's corruption.
[01:12:54.706 --> 01:12:55.246]  Give me a break.
[01:12:55.406 --> 01:12:57.208]  They got steamrolled, my brother.
[01:12:57.428 --> 01:12:58.228]  I hear you, Dee.
[01:12:58.288 --> 01:12:59.189]  I appreciate your call.
[01:12:59.609 --> 01:13:00.450]  Greg in Florida.
[01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.970]  You're on the air.
[01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:01.351]  Go ahead.
[01:13:02.551 --> 01:13:03.292]  Alex, how you doing?
[01:13:03.432 --> 01:13:03.832]  Good, brother.
[01:13:04.673 --> 01:13:05.714]  This is the laser guy.
[01:13:05.814 --> 01:13:06.754]  Hey, three things.
[01:13:07.315 --> 01:13:15.961]  Number one, people forget it was Obama administration that defunded Star Wars program, okay?
[01:13:16.838 --> 01:13:22.220]  Uh, number two, um, we have to get on the offense here.
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:23.220]  All right?
[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:28.362]  Instead of, instead of sitting back waiting for things to happen and then react and talk about it.
[01:13:28.402 --> 01:13:28.602]  No.
[01:13:29.142 --> 01:13:32.583]  So we got to get somewhere and someone's going to be in the offense.
[01:13:32.603 --> 01:13:36.225]  We got to get on the stage and, uh, make some moves here.
[01:13:36.365 --> 01:13:39.046]  This is, uh, they're, they're coming at us all angles.
[01:13:39.106 --> 01:13:41.526]  We got millions of people coming in over the border.
[01:13:41.566 --> 01:13:42.507]  We got all the drugs.
[01:13:43.087 --> 01:13:44.547]  We got people thinking about that.
[01:13:44.607 --> 01:13:46.108]  We got people thinking about Russia.
[01:13:46.661 --> 01:13:47.821]  Yeah, it's terrible.
[01:13:47.841 --> 01:13:51.343]  And Alex, I just want to mention one thing to you.
[01:13:51.163 --> 01:13:54.163]  You know, Ukraine, USA are the same thing right now.
[01:13:54.163 --> 01:13:57.363]  They're, you know, we're, that's our war over there.
[01:13:57.363 --> 01:13:58.203]  That's us fighting.
[01:13:58.203 --> 01:13:59.283]  That's not Ukraine fighting.
[01:13:59.283 --> 01:14:00.803]  That's the USA fighting.
[01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:01.643]  You're right, you're right.
[01:14:01.643 --> 01:14:05.002]  NATO and the US are toe to toe with the Russians right now.
[01:14:05.002 --> 01:14:06.363]  Yeah, it's terrible.
[01:14:06.363 --> 01:14:08.862]  And Alex, I just want to mention one thing to you.
[01:14:08.862 --> 01:14:13.682]  I know things get swamped and especially swamped.
[01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:16.603]  Your mind gets bogged down a lot.
[01:14:16.543 --> 01:14:19.826]  You were having a little bit of a hesitation earlier today.
[01:14:19.906 --> 01:14:25.451]  Sometimes, just take a deep breath, sit back and look at everything third person.
[01:14:26.052 --> 01:14:26.852]  Take a deep breath.
[01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:29.395]  I agree, brother, and I love you and I appreciate you.
[01:14:29.435 --> 01:14:38.362]  I try to disconnect from it all and just be like that Zen or Buddhist term where you still care, but you're removed from it.
[01:14:38.723 --> 01:14:39.724]  And I'm trying to do that.
[01:14:40.144 --> 01:14:41.145]  DJ in New York.
[01:14:41.205 --> 01:14:42.166]  DJ, thanks for calling.
[01:14:43.413 --> 01:14:44.253]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:14:44.494 --> 01:14:49.676]  I just wanted to comment on how things are degrading here in New York at a rapid rate.
[01:14:50.297 --> 01:14:59.101]  When you have all of these migrants come here, and I don't blame your governor down there busting them up here, whoever's flying them up here.
[01:14:59.481 --> 01:15:00.962]  There's so many thousands of them.
[01:15:01.022 --> 01:15:08.226]  Well, I mean, it's a horrible thing to do to you, but we get a hundred times that, so we're just trying to make the Democrats stop by giving them a small taste.
[01:15:09.086 --> 01:15:12.288]  Yeah, well let me tell you what's going to happen, because I think you'll go along with this.
[01:15:13.329 --> 01:15:18.473]  They're putting them up in hotels, and they're talking about a luxury ship they're going to put them on.
[01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:21.936]  They put them up in fairly nice places, cut a deal, pay them.
[01:15:22.437 --> 01:15:28.682]  They got a $100 billion annual budget in this city that I don't even see how they're going to sustain it anymore.
[01:15:29.162 --> 01:15:35.287]  So the mayor is already going with his cup out to the Fed and the state to cover the cost of this.
[01:15:35.347 --> 01:15:37.649]  That's right, we'll start farming them like they do homeless.
[01:15:38.621 --> 01:15:38.841]  Right.
[01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:47.265]  And so Biden is going to go along with it and train the Treasury some more so that these blue states, blue cities can sustain this influx.
[01:15:47.745 --> 01:15:57.750]  Now, you got in the other side of the coin, you got all these people in New York still suffering from the COVID calamity to the economy here.
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:02.884]  And they're getting evicted from their apartments and living in trailers and cars.
[01:16:02.904 --> 01:16:03.385]  Hold on, DJ.
[01:16:03.405 --> 01:16:04.045]  Don't hang up.
[01:16:04.085 --> 01:16:04.946]  I want you to have the floor.
[01:16:04.986 --> 01:16:05.587]  This is important.
[01:16:05.607 --> 01:16:08.289]  I want to play the clip of the mayor saying, this isn't our problem.
[01:16:08.329 --> 01:16:08.950]  We didn't ask for this.
[01:16:09.230 --> 01:16:17.297]  When they're the authors of it, I'm going to play that clip and go back to DJ, then Mike, and so many others straight ahead on this live Tuesday broadcast.
[01:16:17.317 --> 01:16:20.520]  We've got a whole other hour of calls coming up, and then a very, very special guest.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:20.961]  Stay with us.
[01:16:21.601 --> 01:16:23.403]  And please visit Bandot Video, folks.
[01:16:23.443 --> 01:16:24.304]  Such incredible videos.
[01:16:25.475 --> 01:16:28.617]  Welcome back to this Tuesday live October 11th transmission.
[01:16:28.637 --> 01:16:34.099]  We're talking to DJ, then we're going to talk to Angela and others here in just a moment.
[01:16:34.139 --> 01:16:44.164]   But recap, you're in New York describing two years of lockdowns, what it's like, the illegal aliens by the tens of thousands being brought in, your Mayor panicking.
[01:16:44.244 --> 01:16:52.029]  Let's play a clip of the new mayor of New York that just illustrates everything we are talking about.
[01:16:52.409 --> 01:16:55.612]  Here's Eric Adams' clip 4 on the illegal immigrant crisis.
[01:16:55.652 --> 01:16:56.832]  We have not asked for this.
[01:16:57.193 --> 01:16:59.374]  The Democrats literally, Biden said, surged the border.
[01:16:59.434 --> 01:16:59.914]  I'm elected.
[01:17:00.455 --> 01:17:05.298]  There was never any agreement to take on the job of supporting thousands of asylum seekers.
[01:17:06.039 --> 01:17:08.821]  What do you think the rest of the country does taking on millions a month?
[01:17:08.881 --> 01:17:09.621]  It's millions a month.
[01:17:09.861 --> 01:17:10.282]  Here it is.
[01:17:11.002 --> 01:17:11.843]  New Yorkers are angry.
[01:17:12.668 --> 01:17:13.369]  I am angry too.
[01:17:14.370 --> 01:17:16.071]  We have not asked for this.
[01:17:16.912 --> 01:17:22.837]  There was never any agreement to take on the job of supporting thousands of asylum seekers.
[01:17:23.578 --> 01:17:30.444]  This responsibility was simply handed to us without warning as buses began showing up.
[01:17:31.605 --> 01:17:32.767]  There's no playbook for this.
[01:17:33.527 --> 01:17:34.168]  No precedent.
[01:17:35.889 --> 01:17:36.670]  No playbook?
[01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:37.431]  No precedent?
[01:17:38.536 --> 01:17:41.158]  Obama completely opened the border, had millions a month coming across.
[01:17:41.358 --> 01:17:42.519]  Trump basically shut it down 99%.
[01:17:43.179 --> 01:17:48.243]  Then Biden, before he even got elected, said, when I'm elected, immediately surge the border, you'll all be legalized.
[01:17:49.103 --> 01:17:52.185]  Millions and millions and millions and millions a month, just in Texas alone.
[01:17:52.906 --> 01:17:56.088]  Not to mention Arizona and California and other states on the border.
[01:17:57.689 --> 01:17:59.170]  There's no playbook, there's no precedent.
[01:17:59.250 --> 01:18:00.150]  You did this!
[01:18:00.511 --> 01:18:01.892]  Your party did this!
[01:18:03.069 --> 01:18:07.031]  In fact, guys, find the clip of Biden saying, if I get elected, immediately surge the border.
[01:18:07.271 --> 01:18:08.831]  Because that clip doesn't get played enough.
[01:18:09.652 --> 01:18:11.792]  I tell family about that, and they go, oh, he didn't really say that.
[01:18:13.133 --> 01:18:14.253]  Oh, they found the clip that fast.
[01:18:14.413 --> 01:18:15.214]  This crew's incredible.
[01:18:15.434 --> 01:18:15.834]  Here's a clip.
[01:18:16.513 --> 01:18:20.754]  What I would do as president is several more things, because things have changed.
[01:18:21.154 --> 01:18:25.816]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[01:18:26.196 --> 01:18:27.816]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[01:18:28.097 --> 01:18:29.057]  They deserve to be heard.
[01:18:29.077 --> 01:18:29.937]  That's who we are.
[01:18:30.297 --> 01:18:34.178]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee, and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[01:18:34.559 --> 01:18:42.081]  I would change the order that the president just changed, saying women who were being beaten and abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum.
[01:18:42.936 --> 01:18:46.537]   Beat and abuse. They're getting beat and abused now. So you just heard it.
[01:18:46.537 --> 01:18:51.237]  Maybe I should send this clip to the mayor of New York.
[01:18:51.237 --> 01:18:54.436]   There's no precedent. We didn't do this. No, you did do this.
[01:18:54.436 --> 01:18:56.436]  Your party did this, buddy boy.
[01:18:56.436 --> 01:19:01.635]  But they want us all censored, so we can't point that out.
[01:19:01.635 --> 01:19:05.635]   DJ, I wanted to set that up for you. Tell us what's happening in New York. Go ahead.
[01:19:05.635 --> 01:19:16.646]   Well, you know, you got this problem of both the immigrants were migrants and you have the homeless that
[01:19:16.646 --> 01:19:17.636]  were made homeless.
[01:19:17.736 --> 01:19:20.057]  Many people, they can't afford the rent.
[01:19:20.097 --> 01:19:21.518]  The rent is so ridiculous here.
[01:19:22.198 --> 01:19:32.782]  What a conflict between the two and how disenfranchised the citizens have to feel when they're homeless and then other people are being put up in nice hotels and stuff.
[01:19:33.303 --> 01:19:34.603]  It's just absolutely crazy.
[01:19:34.623 --> 01:19:50.945]   And now we've got this witch for a governor that nobody elected and I gotta believe, because we're in a blue state here, they're gonna have an easier time of stealing the election and trying to ease out this Republican that a lot of people outside the city want to be the governor.
[01:19:50.985 --> 01:19:51.385]  Selden.
[01:19:52.206 --> 01:19:54.688]  And it's neck and neck.
[01:19:54.928 --> 01:19:57.631]  I can't even see how it can be neck and neck with those two.
[01:19:58.051 --> 01:20:11.047]   But that's the other problem that we're facing, because this governor Well, the communists want to drive stuff into collapse to make us capitulate.
[01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:13.948]  But as long as we blame them, it backfires on them.
[01:20:14.208 --> 01:20:14.748]  That's the key.
[01:20:15.829 --> 01:20:17.769]  Yeah, well, let me tell you something.
[01:20:17.789 --> 01:20:21.451]  There's so much stuff going on here, it boggles the mind.
[01:20:21.591 --> 01:20:23.892]  And a lot of it is in the outer boroughs, Alex.
[01:20:24.372 --> 01:20:25.692]  What we call the outer boroughs.
[01:20:25.832 --> 01:20:41.952]   In other words, not in Manhattan, because a lot of the restrictions Of the parking do not enable people to be in their cars and sleep in their cars and trailers but out in Queens and in Brooklyn and the Bronx.
[01:20:42.232 --> 01:20:43.013]  It's a war zone.
[01:20:43.833 --> 01:20:46.814]  And you have the subways that I don't even go into anymore.
[01:20:47.195 --> 01:20:48.855]  There's just one by the way.
[01:20:48.875 --> 01:20:55.659]  I've talked to people that are tough guys that have recently been to New York and they said the subways look like our episode of the Road Warrior.
[01:20:56.519 --> 01:20:57.379]  Hey, you met me.
[01:20:57.539 --> 01:20:58.540]  I'm six foot two.
[01:20:59.102 --> 01:21:01.045]  I'm a big guy and I'm capable.
[01:21:01.125 --> 01:21:01.866]  I know how to fight.
[01:21:02.267 --> 01:21:03.288]  I don't want to go down there.
[01:21:03.849 --> 01:21:06.193]  I don't want to get shot or stabbed.
[01:21:06.673 --> 01:21:07.855]  I don't even want to see it.
[01:21:07.875 --> 01:21:10.599]  It's so ugly what goes on down on the subways now.
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.963]  Every day there's... And a lot of people say, well just get a car.
[01:21:12.983 --> 01:21:14.305]  In New York, most people couldn't have a car.
[01:21:15.905 --> 01:21:26.890]  Yeah, well what they do is they go buy a beat-up car or they get a trailer and they hook up the trailer to a vehicle and there are places that are unrestricted parking and you can go to.
[01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:28.471]  So how's it all going to end?
[01:21:28.511 --> 01:21:31.152]  What do you see happening?
[01:21:31.292 --> 01:21:36.154]  I think that the economic collapse nationwide is imminent.
[01:21:36.274 --> 01:21:47.447]   The market is so unstable and down that it's just going to take a little bit Beyond this tipping point, to bring it all the way down, because the globalists control that.
[01:21:47.507 --> 01:21:53.630]  That's their piggy bank, and they're going to pull the trigger on that when they want to, and that may happen before the election as well.
[01:21:53.650 --> 01:21:54.971]  I think it will happen after.
[01:21:55.031 --> 01:21:56.211]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:21:56.972 --> 01:21:57.532]  Thank you, sir.
[01:21:57.652 --> 01:21:58.833]  Mike in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:21:58.853 --> 01:21:59.373]  Thanks for holding.
[01:22:00.473 --> 01:22:00.834]  Okay.
[01:22:01.554 --> 01:22:02.434]  Good to be on, Alex.
[01:22:02.514 --> 01:22:03.635]  I appreciate all your stuff.
[01:22:03.815 --> 01:22:07.076]  I really feel like I'm the worst, saved my family's life.
[01:22:08.695 --> 01:22:15.677]  So I wanted to talk about the Florida Surgeon General's vaccine study that he tweeted out and got canceled real quick.
[01:22:15.857 --> 01:22:16.777]  Isn't he badass?
[01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:18.918]  Yes, he's cool as hell, man.
[01:22:18.938 --> 01:22:20.318]  I'm glad to be a Florida resident.
[01:22:20.859 --> 01:22:26.000]  But so in the fine print of that study, they excluded four groups of people from that study.
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:35.557]   Anyone who had COVID, died of COVID, or got a booster, Or was after... That's right, so it's far worse than even his study.
[01:22:35.597 --> 01:22:37.778]  His study was very conservative.
[01:22:37.858 --> 01:22:38.599]  Right, exactly.
[01:22:38.639 --> 01:22:41.702]  It shows such a small picture of what really is.
[01:22:41.782 --> 01:22:51.590]  So I feel like it would have freaked the whole world out and they would have called it a farce, you know, if they would have... Yeah, not just an 84% increase in heart attacks, men 13 to 38 or whatever.
[01:22:52.951 --> 01:22:53.672]  It's far worse.
[01:22:53.692 --> 01:22:55.994]  But he just did a very conservative study that the state could do.
[01:22:56.957 --> 01:22:59.339]  Yeah, and it's just really incredible.
[01:22:59.379 --> 01:23:03.483]  I mean, I just can't believe that this is like, that people don't freak out over that.
[01:23:03.503 --> 01:23:06.365]  84% is a huge number in that age range.
[01:23:06.385 --> 01:23:07.226]  Man, they're killing us.
[01:23:07.726 --> 01:23:08.567]  And again, they knew it.
[01:23:08.587 --> 01:23:11.950]  Remember, the October 2000 document from the CDC predicted it all.
[01:23:13.081 --> 01:23:14.082]  Yep, they sure did.
[01:23:14.142 --> 01:23:22.108]  They've been calling it since the beginning, and I just, I literally can't thank them for words enough for suggesting going to God and doing their own research.
[01:23:22.508 --> 01:23:24.770]  Brother, we're in this together, so thank you.
[01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:25.390]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:27.712]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:23:27.752 --> 01:23:28.412]  Who's up next?
[01:23:28.813 --> 01:23:30.234]  Carlos in Canada, go ahead.
[01:23:31.875 --> 01:23:32.435]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:23:33.656 --> 01:23:39.841]  About 2,000 years ago, Jesus of Nazareth, in the temple, flipped the moneylender's tables over.
[01:23:41.949 --> 01:23:46.331]  Not the sort of thing we expected Jesus of Nazareth to do, but he did.
[01:23:46.351 --> 01:23:49.392]  The only time Christ got violent was with the bankers.
[01:23:50.353 --> 01:23:50.553]  Right.
[01:23:50.773 --> 01:23:51.553]  And what did he say?
[01:23:52.254 --> 01:23:55.655]  Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and you don't belong here.
[01:23:56.436 --> 01:24:04.479]  The day that the moneylenders decided that they were going to run the world, Alex, we should have overturned their tables.
[01:24:05.139 --> 01:24:05.620]  And we didn't.
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:06.360]  We haven't.
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:08.081]  And now we're paying the price.
[01:24:08.481 --> 01:24:15.593]   Essentially, the bottom line is that Yeah, now PayPal says they're going to fine you $2,500 for political views.
[01:24:15.914 --> 01:24:17.615]  We've given the bankers total control.
[01:24:17.635 --> 01:24:18.915]  That's right.
[01:24:19.176 --> 01:24:22.738]  And it's always through the financial control that they try to control you.
[01:24:22.978 --> 01:24:23.578]  Have you noticed?
[01:24:24.158 --> 01:24:30.842]  It's always financial control, either through lawfare or financial control through firing you.
[01:24:31.403 --> 01:24:37.326]  And it incorporated into a body called Corporation that became international.
[01:24:37.819 --> 01:24:52.047]  And if you listen carefully and decode Prince Charles' comments to the World Economic Forum, he says, today, you guys, the 1,000 corporations that are members of the World Economic Forum, you guys have more money than entire governments.
[01:24:52.387 --> 01:24:59.291]  You are now the governments of the world, and we have to defend that power with military order.
[01:25:00.171 --> 01:25:07.293]   Now, if we don't listen to that, we lose our liberty, And essentially, you bring down the individual, but
[01:25:07.293 --> 01:25:13.713]   eventually you have to bring down the constitutions that were forged through effort for 2,000
[01:25:13.713 --> 01:25:20.453]   years, through wars and peace and treaties of Westphalia, etc., to get so that we have
[01:25:20.453 --> 01:25:24.213]  corporations to destroy our institutions.
[01:25:24.213 --> 01:25:25.213]  And that's what's next.
[01:25:25.213 --> 01:25:30.813]   It is the American Constitution, the destruction of America that must take place for them to
[01:25:30.813 --> 01:25:32.313]  take over the world.
[01:25:32.313 --> 01:25:33.313]  And that's what it's all about.
[01:25:33.313 --> 01:25:34.573]  It's as simple as that.
[01:25:34.573 --> 01:25:36.652]  Now, do we want to go along with that?
[01:25:36.652 --> 01:25:37.652]  Do we want to...
[01:25:37.652 --> 01:25:38.652]  No, you're right.
[01:25:38.652 --> 01:25:41.573]   They're turning us into chattel slavery and saying, "We control your mind and you can't
[01:25:42.411 --> 01:25:43.792]  We should all unify behind it.
[01:25:44.192 --> 01:25:46.894]  Isn't it good that people backlash against PayPal?
[01:25:47.895 --> 01:25:48.635]  Well, yes.
[01:25:48.915 --> 01:25:59.441]  And among other things, nobody wants to have to milk their insects in the morning because there's no milk to go with your breakfast and then eat those insects for lunch.
[01:25:59.861 --> 01:26:02.283]  I mean, this is a world that we simply do not want.
[01:26:02.739 --> 01:26:04.540]  They're selling us a dystopia.
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:07.821]  Instead, we should reject the New World Order and everything it stands for.
[01:26:07.841 --> 01:26:08.461]  Thank you, Carlos.
[01:26:09.121 --> 01:26:15.584]  Alright, Angela, Alex, Jason, Frank, Jordan, son of Abraham, Tyson, Greg, David.
[01:26:15.664 --> 01:26:17.524]  The order, your calls came in.
[01:26:18.045 --> 01:26:23.246]  The next hour will be nothing but calls and some other breaking news we've got coming in.
[01:26:23.567 --> 01:26:26.027]  But it's all coming up next hour.
[01:26:26.708 --> 01:26:26.968]  And then...
[01:26:28.194 --> 01:26:30.676]  I'm told Mike Adams has got, he's always got huge news.
[01:26:30.776 --> 01:26:31.797]  It's always world-changing.
[01:26:31.837 --> 01:26:33.618]  It's always just most important you can hear.
[01:26:34.038 --> 01:26:37.020]  But Mike Adams has got big news in the fourth hour today.
[01:26:37.421 --> 01:26:40.383]  Out of the war room with the great Owen Schroer, 3 p.m.
[01:26:40.423 --> 01:26:40.803]  Central.
[01:26:41.023 --> 01:26:48.188]  Only way the transmission gets out is you taking the links at Band.Video and InfoWars.com forward slash show and sharing them.
[01:26:48.488 --> 01:26:49.549]  And of course they're censored.
[01:26:51.130 --> 01:26:53.292]  Because it's truth and it's victory.
[01:26:53.953 --> 01:26:55.953]  We'll be right back with hour number three.
[01:26:56.953 --> 01:27:02.953]  [Music]
[01:27:02.953 --> 01:27:04.953]  Why don't we talk about cryptocurrency?
[01:27:04.953 --> 01:27:14.953]   Because one of the ways that you encourage your audience to give you money is in cryptocurrency donations, right?
[01:27:15.383 --> 01:27:15.643]  Yes.
[01:27:16.284 --> 01:27:19.727]  And you have a page on your website that's just for cryptocurrency donations, right?
[01:27:20.067 --> 01:27:21.909]  InfoWars.com forward slash crypto.
[01:27:21.989 --> 01:27:24.631]  Is that a little advertisement just there?
[01:27:24.791 --> 01:27:25.812]  Well, we're fighting the deep state.
[01:27:25.852 --> 01:27:26.353]  We need money.
[01:27:26.573 --> 01:27:26.793]  All right.
[01:27:27.734 --> 01:27:28.374]  This is it.
[01:27:29.035 --> 01:27:29.916]  Give crypto.
[01:27:30.036 --> 01:27:31.157]  Fund InfoWars.
[01:27:31.966 --> 01:27:35.149]  Sponsor us with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, right?
[01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:38.231]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight.
[01:27:38.251 --> 01:27:40.273]  Your advertisement for a cryptocurrency page.
[01:27:41.594 --> 01:27:46.038]  You know, I mean, I mean, people want to keep us in the fight.
[01:27:46.118 --> 01:27:49.341]  So I mean, I hope whoever the big whales are, they'll give us money before we keep doing it.
[01:27:49.781 --> 01:27:50.842]  We'll just keep, we'll just keep.
[01:27:52.003 --> 01:27:53.625]  I'm eating money as you're in this boardroom.
[01:27:53.725 --> 01:27:57.208]  Alright, let's move on.
[01:27:57.087 --> 01:27:59.087]  People care about the First Amendment.
[01:27:59.087 --> 01:28:03.087]  [Music]
[01:28:03.087 --> 01:28:08.087]   Well, we're getting a lot of great perspectives and angles that I wouldn't have thought of
[01:28:08.087 --> 01:28:14.516]   taking these incredible callers and we're taking them again right now, throughout this hour, on this live Tuesday
[01:28:14.516 --> 01:28:15.087]  broadcast.
[01:28:15.850 --> 01:28:17.972]  Angela in Wisconsin, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:28:19.813 --> 01:28:21.174]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:28:21.454 --> 01:28:26.138]  Thank you so much for taking my call and thank you for your stand for America.
[01:28:26.178 --> 01:28:28.740]  You truly are the Paul Revere of our day and time.
[01:28:29.341 --> 01:28:46.410]   My goodness, Alex, if they hadn't of You served our free speech, and by listening to your show I realize now, through the last couple few years, that they never would have gotten away with all this.
[01:28:47.071 --> 01:28:51.534]  And if it wasn't for your show, they would have gotten away with a lot more, and we'd probably all be slaves at work right now.
[01:28:51.554 --> 01:28:52.214]  It wasn't for you.
[01:28:52.234 --> 01:28:53.955]  I want to be clear.
[01:28:53.975 --> 01:28:56.137]  I don't just give you guys credit and pat you on the head.
[01:28:56.657 --> 01:28:58.218]  It's the audience they're scared of.
[01:28:58.318 --> 01:28:59.378]  It's your activism.
[01:28:59.419 --> 01:29:00.419]  You're spreading the word.
[01:29:00.939 --> 01:29:02.080]  That's why they fear the show.
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:04.682]  So that's when you give me credit, I'm just like you.
[01:29:05.422 --> 01:29:08.244]  We're all in this together, but it's you guys they fear, so thank you.
[01:29:09.365 --> 01:29:10.965]  You're welcome, but let's face it.
[01:29:11.186 --> 01:29:14.948]  I don't have the education and all your contributors.
[01:29:15.666 --> 01:29:20.710]  The schooling, the training they went through, I have to commend them for that, because I never did that.
[01:29:21.251 --> 01:29:22.171]  And I appreciate it.
[01:29:22.351 --> 01:29:25.534]  And it's finally being put to good use.
[01:29:25.634 --> 01:29:34.381]  In this case, saving our country from our countrymen, us good people from World War III, them getting away with it.
[01:29:34.441 --> 01:29:35.622]  We're going to get the victory.
[01:29:35.762 --> 01:29:45.010]  And finally, we'll be able to end the corruption and go forward without all this corrupted up the heck of our constitutional rights.
[01:29:45.768 --> 01:29:48.329]  We can put it back on track the way it should be.
[01:29:48.789 --> 01:30:01.354]  Oh, so anyway, um, I did call about one thing, but in light of your being so over, uh, loaded and overwhelmed, I just wanted to give you personally one thing from my heart to you.
[01:30:01.854 --> 01:30:06.496]  There's the, some people take vitamins and you said you get quiet sometimes.
[01:30:07.136 --> 01:30:09.317]  I do that too, but I listened to this song.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:18.264]  At the beginning of all this and I was listening to you and I was listening to that and I got back to my roots and biblical research on ministry that's been around for 80 years.
[01:30:18.984 --> 01:30:20.465]  They don't have a crystal palace.
[01:30:20.505 --> 01:30:21.465]  They're out of Ohio.
[01:30:21.945 --> 01:30:25.267]  Been around for 80 years now, and it's the way.org.
[01:30:25.307 --> 01:30:32.730]  They've got stuff there that might, it would just keep, if nothing else, it'll just make you feel good that there's more people out there that are doing their part.
[01:30:32.791 --> 01:30:36.032]  Well, it's definitely real Christians are the main opposition in the New World Order.
[01:30:37.662 --> 01:30:46.810]  There's this song, when I was in my 20s and I first got introduced to this ministry, I went to a function, and I heard this group play, and their song is still available.
[01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:49.893]  It's called, Accidentally.
[01:30:50.133 --> 01:30:54.638]  You go to YouTube, you gotta type in Accidentally by Good Seed Band.
[01:30:55.438 --> 01:30:57.500]  And it's so old, Alex, but guess what?
[01:30:58.461 --> 01:31:00.223]  It's on a TV show!
[01:31:01.525 --> 01:31:02.766]  Years and years ago.
[01:31:03.166 --> 01:31:04.447]  That's my hope.
[01:31:04.487 --> 01:31:10.812]  Not only will this song, what it does for me is sometimes I'm overloaded or I call it overwhelmed.
[01:31:11.332 --> 01:31:13.634]  I'll just get, you know, as peaceful as I can.
[01:31:13.654 --> 01:31:18.057]  You say accidentally, accidentally by the good, good band.
[01:31:18.597 --> 01:31:19.778]  I appreciate your call.
[01:31:20.118 --> 01:31:20.619]  You're beautiful.
[01:31:20.639 --> 01:31:20.979]  We love you.
[01:31:20.999 --> 01:31:21.760]  We're the next person.
[01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:22.820]  Look it up, folks.
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:23.081]  Thanks.
[01:31:23.541 --> 01:31:24.522]  Jason in Texas.
[01:31:24.542 --> 01:31:24.882]  Go ahead.
[01:31:28.604 --> 01:31:31.266]  The election is not going to happen.
[01:31:31.326 --> 01:31:35.468]  I mean, I don't want it to be, like we always say, you know, doom and gloom.
[01:31:35.528 --> 01:31:37.269]  But that's their only hope now.
[01:31:37.309 --> 01:31:39.450]  They know they're going to get smoked at this election.
[01:31:40.211 --> 01:31:44.913]  And they're going to come up with some, you know, like the power or something.
[01:31:44.933 --> 01:31:46.914]  But I think it's just going to be a Duke strike.
[01:31:46.934 --> 01:31:54.379]  Because if you go back, just like you played earlier with Obama and Soros, you know how they say things and they happen.
[01:31:54.839 --> 01:31:56.700]  Well, I brought this up two years ago.
[01:31:57.611 --> 01:31:58.391]  Bring it up again.
[01:31:58.751 --> 01:32:04.173]  Eric Solwell, when he says we need to start nuking our own cities and states, mostly red states.
[01:32:04.194 --> 01:32:06.574]  He tweeted he said we should start nuking Republicans, yeah.
[01:32:07.375 --> 01:32:09.135]  And there's your foreshadowing right there.
[01:32:09.155 --> 01:32:15.758]  So they'll probably like blow up a midwestern town like Omaha or something or Oklahoma City and blame it on us.
[01:32:17.065 --> 01:32:23.430]  Well, no, they're the ones doing it, but they're going to blame China, Russia, some crap like that, and then, oh, we've got to go to war.
[01:32:23.690 --> 01:32:28.093]  They will suspend the election, which they can and have the power to, and that's going to be it.
[01:32:28.453 --> 01:32:31.616]  So, but yeah, it's... I don't know.
[01:32:31.756 --> 01:32:42.103]  Pray to somebody, and we need help bad, but like the last man said, we need to go on the offensive because we can't sit back and take this no more, and we need people like Tucker Carlson, you, everybody.
[01:32:42.123 --> 01:32:43.284]  Hold on, hold on, hang on, Jason.
[01:32:43.304 --> 01:32:45.285]  I want to come right back to you in 60 seconds.
[01:32:46.667 --> 01:32:47.427]  We'll be right back.
[01:32:48.087 --> 01:32:48.508]  Stay with us.
[01:32:48.528 --> 01:32:49.908]  I want to play a Tulsi Gabbard clip again.
[01:32:49.948 --> 01:32:51.348]  It's so powerful in World War III.
[01:32:51.688 --> 01:32:52.849]  We'll go right back to Jason.
[01:32:52.869 --> 01:32:53.249]  Stay with us.
[01:32:54.909 --> 01:33:10.614]  I can no longer remain in today's Democratic Party that's under the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers who are driven by cowardly wokeness, who divide us by racializing every issue and stoking anti-white racism.
[01:33:11.314 --> 01:33:16.558]  Who actively work to undermine our God-given freedoms that are enshrined in our Constitution.
[01:33:17.218 --> 01:33:20.681]  Who are hostile to people of faith and spirituality.
[01:33:21.321 --> 01:33:25.884]  Who demonize the police but protect criminals at the expense of law-abiding Americans.
[01:33:26.445 --> 01:33:27.766]  Who believe in open borders.
[01:33:27.846 --> 01:33:32.449]  Who weaponize the national security state to go after their political opponents.
[01:33:33.170 --> 01:33:37.353]  And above all, who are dragging us ever closer to nuclear war.
[01:33:38.755 --> 01:33:44.601]  Now, I believe in a government that's of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[01:33:45.702 --> 01:33:48.064]  Unfortunately, today's Democratic Party does not.
[01:33:48.625 --> 01:33:54.350]  Instead, it stands for a government that is of, by, and for the powerful elite.
[01:33:55.691 --> 01:34:02.738]  Now, I'm calling on my fellow common-sense, independent-minded Democrats to join me in leaving the Democratic Party.
[01:34:03.729 --> 01:34:12.436]  If you can no longer stomach the direction that the so-called woke Democratic Party ideologues are taking our country, then I invite you to join me.
[01:34:15.159 --> 01:34:16.700]  People are waking up.
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:18.782]  Jason in Texas got cut off at the break.
[01:34:18.802 --> 01:34:19.703]  Some stations just joined us.
[01:34:20.503 --> 01:34:26.008]  Recap what you were saying about believing they're going to stage a false flag ahead of the elections and try to suspend the elections.
[01:34:26.068 --> 01:34:29.051]  I think that's a real possibility about what we've seen.
[01:34:30.643 --> 01:34:40.306]  We've seen the pre-programming, cyber attack, white supremacist attack, chemical biological attack, nuclear attack, I think it's all in the cards right now, in the next 28 days.
[01:34:40.626 --> 01:34:41.707]  Your view on that, Jason?
[01:34:42.687 --> 01:34:44.227]  Again, that's all I have.
[01:34:44.307 --> 01:34:49.549]  They know they're going to lose this election, and that's all they have.
[01:34:49.569 --> 01:34:51.890]  That's all I can say is, yeah, they're going to use that.
[01:34:52.370 --> 01:34:57.852]  They can suspend the election during wartime, which, you know, we all know that, and that's their only play.
[01:34:59.318 --> 01:35:02.279]  And with this whole Tulsi Gabbard thing, they just wrote her off already.
[01:35:02.319 --> 01:35:11.663]  I just read the article on Gateway Pond and all main Democrat media and all that are already calling her, you know, she was a Republican anyways and this and that.
[01:35:11.683 --> 01:35:14.304]  So they just get rid of her.
[01:35:14.864 --> 01:35:18.125]  And then they're speeding up the whole inflation and all that.
[01:35:18.165 --> 01:35:27.173]   The gas is soaring, food's soaring, people are going to start, you know, stealing from the stores, wiping out the stores and big old You know, riots and fights over food.
[01:35:27.233 --> 01:35:32.276]  And my concern is they're going to do it, even if the Republicans get in, they've got a bunch of neocons at the top.
[01:35:32.957 --> 01:35:38.021]  We've got a contingent of good people, but they're going to blame Republicans for the collapse that they've instituted.
[01:35:39.001 --> 01:35:39.702]  Absolutely.
[01:35:39.842 --> 01:35:41.243]  So get prepared, everyone.
[01:35:41.263 --> 01:35:43.084]  Thank you, Jason.
[01:35:43.104 --> 01:35:44.265]  Everybody should get ready now.
[01:35:44.906 --> 01:35:45.766]  All right, more calls.
[01:35:45.886 --> 01:35:47.147]  Jordan in New Jersey.
[01:35:47.227 --> 01:35:48.048]  Jordan, you're on the air.
[01:35:48.328 --> 01:35:48.889]  Thanks for calling.
[01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:51.290]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:35:52.472 --> 01:35:55.453]  Jordan here of www.coronaeyes.com.
[01:35:56.174 --> 01:35:58.075]  I just want to issue a warning.
[01:35:59.475 --> 01:36:02.036]  I saw Tom Renz on your program yesterday.
[01:36:02.637 --> 01:36:14.062]  I understand a big lawsuit is going through and I just want to, I believe that this is not only a bioweapon, these forced injections or close to forced and will be forced in the future.
[01:36:14.902 --> 01:36:18.724]  We're dealing with something that is what you always described as a binary weapon.
[01:36:19.724 --> 01:36:21.145]  So it's kill and control.
[01:36:22.146 --> 01:36:29.393]  Um, and I just want to first issue a warning to you and Mr. Renz and others in the community that this is more than it appears.
[01:36:29.634 --> 01:36:31.055]  People are dying in huge numbers.
[01:36:31.741 --> 01:36:36.205]  But there's people that are living through this injection and they're not just cold shots as you call them.
[01:36:36.645 --> 01:36:41.129]  There are people that are actually, the technology that's inserted into these are taking in folks.
[01:36:41.769 --> 01:36:56.682]  And so, I think that the injections and the public emergency for, you know, the health public emergency is everything we should be fighting right now because they can do anything right now and declare... Oh, you're right, and they're planning to bring it back.
[01:36:57.503 --> 01:36:59.064]  They're planning to bring this tyranny back.
[01:36:59.992 --> 01:37:19.185]  And they can suspend elections at will, and the two events that need to be overturned for once and for all, and one of these are your primary genesis of you, Alex, is 9-11, which the war on terror has never been declared over, and this health emergency, which will be what they can utilize immediately to call off elections.
[01:37:19.926 --> 01:37:22.307]  Now, I know you have a Mike Adams on later.
[01:37:22.488 --> 01:37:32.105]   I've done a lot of research, and you've got to really have me on the show sometime, but what Mike Adams discovered are not blood clots, they are called organoids and/or 3D cyborg
[01:37:32.105 --> 01:37:32.554]  tissue.
[01:37:32.554 --> 01:37:37.255]   And this is why Charles Lieber comes involved, and I'm saying that the element of the whole release...
[01:37:37.255 --> 01:37:41.255]   Yeah, they're implanting us with the electrochemical plugs in our body.
[01:37:41.255 --> 01:37:44.755]  And I'm just saying, so that's part of what this is.
[01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:47.291]  Some people die, and I think they're even targeted.
[01:37:47.331 --> 01:37:55.575]  You look at Steve Kerch's research about the lot numbers, they probably put some bad stuff in these... Now you're right, it's a mass experiment.
[01:37:55.916 --> 01:37:58.537]  It's meant to turn some people into cyborgs, others to kills.
[01:37:59.813 --> 01:38:01.534]  I'm just saying, so we have to be careful of that.
[01:38:01.594 --> 01:38:09.798]  Now, we need to have verification of Dr. Pablo Cambra's results that he did with optical microscopy, okay, for the fifth column.
[01:38:10.118 --> 01:38:16.481]  There needs to be a seizure of these lots, and there has to be a serious, assiduous study of all these injections.
[01:38:16.842 --> 01:38:17.162]  Now!
[01:38:18.022 --> 01:38:19.763]  No, I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[01:38:19.963 --> 01:38:20.904]  Great points, Jordan.
[01:38:21.324 --> 01:38:22.544]  Greg in Utah, you're on the air.
[01:38:23.925 --> 01:38:25.426]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[01:38:25.926 --> 01:38:27.687]  I'm kind of sticking my neck out there.
[01:38:28.596 --> 01:38:40.225]  I don't know of anybody besides you that understands this because of the nature of what I'm about to tell you, but I came up with the discovery on water.
[01:38:41.366 --> 01:38:54.196]  I sent John a clip and what happened was I basically had a saltwater well and I wasn't going to give up my homestead because I found saltwater.
[01:38:55.176 --> 01:38:59.710]   And through some prayer and some research, I discovered something huge.
[01:39:00.570 --> 01:39:03.593]  Now, I'm not taking this to the university.
[01:39:03.653 --> 01:39:05.154]  I'm not taking it to a professor.
[01:39:05.174 --> 01:39:07.396]  I'm bringing it to the people who need it.
[01:39:08.357 --> 01:39:13.101]  But I came up with something I'm calling the Flat Top Solar Still.
[01:39:14.162 --> 01:39:15.543]  It operates off the sun.
[01:39:16.104 --> 01:39:20.848]  It has a constant flow of water coming out from any water source.
[01:39:21.829 --> 01:39:24.271]  Hot water, black water, it doesn't matter.
[01:39:24.821 --> 01:39:28.062]  I'm writing a small book on it, and I'd like to offer you authored copies.
[01:39:28.082 --> 01:39:29.663]  Okay, well, this is above my pay grade.
[01:39:29.783 --> 01:39:32.603]  Are you saying you have a free energy machine, or what are you saying about water?
[01:39:33.424 --> 01:39:35.084]  No, no, it's just, it's simple.
[01:39:35.144 --> 01:39:39.186]  I just went to the hardware store, and this is an instruction manual on how to build one yourself.
[01:39:40.026 --> 01:39:42.427]  It's, it's, nobody thought outside the box.
[01:39:43.127 --> 01:39:44.087]  Okay, what is it?
[01:39:44.107 --> 01:39:45.888]  Talk to me like I'm five years old.
[01:39:46.988 --> 01:39:48.969]  Okay, it's a solar still.
[01:39:49.569 --> 01:39:53.170]  Basically, the water inside it boils because of the design.
[01:39:53.703 --> 01:39:56.906]  That they've had for thousands of years, they've never been able to make this big.
[01:39:57.566 --> 01:40:01.610]  They didn't think of water as a vapor, as a gas that wants to fill a space.
[01:40:01.670 --> 01:40:07.775]  And because I realized that, I had a dream one night, and I can collect every drop.
[01:40:08.236 --> 01:40:10.037]  In fact, I've got a condenser in there.
[01:40:10.057 --> 01:40:12.659]  So I've got unlimited collection surfaces.
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:21.627]  And as fast as that water is boiling with just a few to three PV panels, I've got a constant purified water coming out of it.
[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:24.022]  Alright, send me an email about it.
[01:40:24.142 --> 01:40:24.763]  Very interesting.
[01:40:24.783 --> 01:40:25.744]  I appreciate your call, Greg.
[01:40:26.084 --> 01:40:27.446]  Let's talk to Alex in Florida.
[01:40:27.526 --> 01:40:28.167]  Alex, you're on the air.
[01:40:29.368 --> 01:40:30.109]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:32.172]  Thank you for taking my call, and please forgive me.
[01:40:32.232 --> 01:40:35.075]  I'm getting over a little bronchitis, so my voice might be a little weak.
[01:40:35.115 --> 01:40:36.177]  I hope you can hear me okay?
[01:40:36.577 --> 01:40:37.118]  I understand.
[01:40:38.045 --> 01:40:39.606]  I wanted to just get my two cents.
[01:40:39.686 --> 01:40:45.008]  I'm here in Florida and I just wanted to explain what I've been seeing with everybody that I know that took the shot.
[01:40:45.529 --> 01:40:52.892]  You know, as soon as my cousin and my dad took it, a month later they were in the hospital for lower back issues, turned out disc and spinal cord issues.
[01:40:53.312 --> 01:40:58.674]  Talked to a young lady the other day, 22 years old, she went and took it, didn't get her period for nine months.
[01:40:59.175 --> 01:41:04.061]   And I have a co-worker who's literally over the past few weeks In and out of the doctor's office.
[01:41:04.061 --> 01:41:08.601]   Oh, they're saying now I have rare blood issues, but they're going to get to the bottom of it.
[01:41:08.601 --> 01:41:11.961]   And nobody knows what it is, but it comes back three days later.
[01:41:11.961 --> 01:41:16.902]   Oh, well, they said now it's a heart issue, and they think I have a rare heart disease,
[01:41:16.902 --> 01:41:18.021]  but they've never seen it before.
[01:41:18.021 --> 01:41:19.701]  But they're going to get to the bottom of it.
[01:41:19.701 --> 01:41:20.900]  It comes back three days later.
[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:25.662]   Oh, I have stacks of news articles, record heart attacks in teenagers, you name it.
[01:41:25.662 --> 01:41:27.162]  They have killed us.
[01:41:27.162 --> 01:41:30.662]   Oh, well, it's crazy because she comes back three days later, and the doctors are like,
[01:41:30.662 --> 01:41:31.662]  "Oh, we figured it out."
[01:41:31.736 --> 01:41:33.678]  You have an autoimmune disease now.
[01:41:33.738 --> 01:41:35.540]  And I'm like, oh, my gosh, you poor girl.
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:36.881]  You took two shots.
[01:41:36.961 --> 01:41:38.283]  Nobody's linking it to it.
[01:41:38.663 --> 01:41:40.265]  Doctors won't say a damn thing.
[01:41:40.285 --> 01:41:45.209]  And I'm like, OK, well, either they're incompetent or they're told not to or they're incentivized not to.
[01:41:45.370 --> 01:41:48.773]  Either way, I'm so happy the Surgeon General came out and said what he said.
[01:41:49.113 --> 01:41:53.503]  Because now everybody's gonna wake up and now there's all these articles normalizing it.
[01:41:53.543 --> 01:41:55.107]  Oh, video games cause heart attacks.
[01:41:55.508 --> 01:41:56.109]  It's normal.
[01:41:56.169 --> 01:41:57.472]  Kids are suddenly gonna have heart attacks.
[01:41:57.532 --> 01:41:58.515]  It's so sick.
[01:41:59.406 --> 01:42:02.489]  Well, yeah, and I want to give it to my aunt.
[01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:03.710]  She went and took it.
[01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:07.474]  She was a God-fearing black New Orleans woman.
[01:42:07.934 --> 01:42:08.975]  Stay there, Alex.
[01:42:08.995 --> 01:42:09.516]  Don't hang up.
[01:42:09.536 --> 01:42:11.818]  I want to hear what happened to your family when we come back.
[01:42:11.858 --> 01:42:16.582]  And then Frank, Vaughn, son of Abraham, Tyson, David, David, Russell, Polly.
[01:42:16.903 --> 01:42:17.683]  We're taking the calls.
[01:42:17.703 --> 01:42:19.605]  The order, they are received.
[01:42:21.287 --> 01:42:23.229]  Don't hear this type of information anywhere else.
[01:42:25.031 --> 01:42:27.273]  The people directly jacked into millions of other listeners.
[01:42:27.873 --> 01:42:30.195]  This is what the New World Order fears will be right back.
[01:42:31.695 --> 01:42:33.695]  Does that make me crazy?
[01:42:33.695 --> 01:42:37.534]  Does that make me crazy?
[01:42:37.534 --> 01:42:41.775]  Does that make me crazy?
[01:42:45.025 --> 01:42:52.010]  I'm gonna go right back to Alex in Florida talking about what happened to his family when they took the poison shot.
[01:42:53.490 --> 01:42:55.170]  There are some of the headlines just today.
[01:42:55.751 --> 01:43:00.192]  FDA withholds autopsy results of those who died after COVID shots.
[01:43:01.032 --> 01:43:02.752]  That story is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:43:04.613 --> 01:43:05.633]  Big Pharma at work.
[01:43:05.693 --> 01:43:12.095]  Twitter censors Florida Surgeon General for recommending young males refrain from receiving the COVID vaccine because of mass death.
[01:43:14.215 --> 01:43:24.477]  Wow, fake news, Washington Post outdoes itself, finally reports on pregnancy complications during COVID but can't quite pin into the mandatory experimental shot.
[01:43:26.417 --> 01:43:36.499]  Even though the New England Journal of Medicine found almost two years ago an 80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first and second trimesters.
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:39.340]  You see this folder?
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:40.320]  That's COVID camps.
[01:43:41.343 --> 01:43:42.584]  We've got the latest info on it.
[01:43:42.624 --> 01:43:43.986]  I'm ready to do a whole show on it.
[01:43:44.346 --> 01:43:44.967]  Probably tomorrow.
[01:43:44.987 --> 01:43:46.288]  We've got a lot of video clips and more.
[01:43:46.308 --> 01:43:47.710]  Probably be tomorrow.
[01:43:47.730 --> 01:43:49.531]  If not, it'll be Thursday.
[01:43:49.932 --> 01:43:50.653]  Probably Wednesday.
[01:43:51.533 --> 01:43:53.195]  But right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:43:53.736 --> 01:43:55.417]  Alex, start over with what happened to your family.
[01:43:55.437 --> 01:43:55.718]  Go ahead.
[01:43:57.279 --> 01:44:15.495]  So, my aunt, she, a year ago, around Christmas time, a little before that, she went and took the shots, and I tried talking to her, warning her, and she was a very strong, healthy, God-fearing Christian woman, black as black, from New Orleans, and now, nine months later, in and out of the hospitals, and she has cancer.
[01:44:16.776 --> 01:44:19.979]  And it just breaks my heart, because these are my co-workers, these are my friends.
[01:44:20.019 --> 01:44:21.300]  Brother, I'm so sorry to hear that.
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:23.042]  Has she figured out the causal effect?
[01:44:24.361 --> 01:44:28.284]  No, honestly, she's just put her faith in God and at that point I let her rest there.
[01:44:28.365 --> 01:44:31.227]  You know, at the end of the day, I don't want to cause any further fear.
[01:44:31.607 --> 01:44:34.109]  Just find the light and, you know, spread the love.
[01:44:34.730 --> 01:44:40.915]  Well, I'm not your doctor, but a lot of studies show the crystals are growing in her, the spike protein.
[01:44:41.355 --> 01:44:42.937]  If she gets ivermectin, it might help her.
[01:44:44.372 --> 01:44:46.194]  Well, I do try to help as many as I can.
[01:44:46.414 --> 01:44:49.737]  I recommend all sorts of remedies, and I do a lot of research for detoxing.
[01:44:49.757 --> 01:44:53.840]  So, Lord knows, I'll pass that along to her, because I actually have some by Rebecca, thanks to you.
[01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:54.901]  So, thank you so much.
[01:44:57.103 --> 01:44:58.684]  Well, brother, I'm sorry to hear that's happening.
[01:44:58.764 --> 01:44:59.625]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:45:00.746 --> 01:45:01.066]  No, sir.
[01:45:01.106 --> 01:45:06.971]  I just wanted to give you my two cents of what I'm seeing on the ground with what the shots are really doing, even though, of course, they're not reporting it.
[01:45:06.991 --> 01:45:10.094]  So, thank goodness for the Surgeon General of Florida, because now that's confirmed.
[01:45:11.263 --> 01:45:15.265]  Everything to come out even further, and I hope people wake up and just protect more innocent lives.
[01:45:15.745 --> 01:45:16.125]  Absolutely.
[01:45:16.145 --> 01:45:16.886]  We're fighting back.
[01:45:16.926 --> 01:45:17.626]  That's the good news.
[01:45:17.686 --> 01:45:18.266]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:45:18.867 --> 01:45:20.027]  Frank in Chicago.
[01:45:20.088 --> 01:45:20.528]  Go ahead.
[01:45:22.309 --> 01:45:22.729]  Hey, bud.
[01:45:22.769 --> 01:45:23.930]  How are you?
[01:45:24.910 --> 01:45:28.652]  We have the blueprint of what's going to happen in the Book of Revelation.
[01:45:29.773 --> 01:45:33.455]  You know, America needs to collapse in order for this agenda to come through.
[01:45:36.631 --> 01:45:46.799]  I believe it's going to happen through the banking system, and then through the internet, and that's how they can control you with basically the Mark of the Beast, and the Beast system is already being laid out.
[01:45:46.859 --> 01:45:51.242]  I mean, if you look at what's happening in Israel, they've received five red heifers.
[01:45:51.683 --> 01:46:12.164]   The last, there's been nine red heifers that have been, for sacrifice, the last... And when the tenth red heifer is sacrificed, the third temple will be built, and that's one of the The last sign of Jesus' return, because the Antichrist is going to set up in the temple and declare himself God.
[01:46:13.004 --> 01:46:16.265]  So, I think everybody's missing what's happening here.
[01:46:16.545 --> 01:46:18.165]  We can't change what's going to happen.
[01:46:18.245 --> 01:46:27.408]  It's been written down, and the only way to beat what's happening is to repent and turn to Jesus, and He's your only Savior.
[01:46:27.848 --> 01:46:28.288]  That's it.
[01:46:28.368 --> 01:46:32.289]  We're the last generation, and we're going to see this all come to pass.
[01:46:34.611 --> 01:46:35.352]  Brother, I hear you.
[01:46:35.372 --> 01:46:36.253]  We're in biblical times.
[01:46:36.313 --> 01:46:36.733]  Thank you.
[01:46:37.233 --> 01:46:39.435]  Son of Abraham, calling from Texas, you're on the air.
[01:46:39.455 --> 01:46:42.838]  Yes, can you hear me Alex?
[01:46:43.159 --> 01:46:43.979]  I can brother, go ahead.
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:46.482]  Alright, just want to make a quick plug.
[01:46:46.542 --> 01:46:59.802]   Some of the products I got, Prostagard, Brain Force, Plus, Body, Living Defense, iCurin, Physiomagnesium, Knockout, X3, X2, Vazobeats, Supramel, Winter Sun and Ultra 12.
[01:46:59.922 --> 01:47:01.423]  Just want to plug those in really quick.
[01:47:01.963 --> 01:47:12.666]  Yeah, I wanted to touch on something that a lot of people haven't really, I guess, been talking about, which is the Ebola outbreak that has just occurred in the Sudan and how that could also pose a threat.
[01:47:12.686 --> 01:47:19.188]  It says that it takes about two days to three weeks after exposure for symptoms to appear.
[01:47:19.268 --> 01:47:22.168]  So, one of those things that aren't being discussed right now.
[01:47:22.709 --> 01:47:24.009]  I just wanted to bring attention to that.
[01:47:24.249 --> 01:47:29.211]  No, I'm glad you raised that, because we know the globalists were heavily involved in the last big Ebola outbreak.
[01:47:31.151 --> 01:47:41.615]  Yeah, actually, just like Bill Gates had said, they were going to release their deadlier bioweapons, and so I just want to go ahead and bring that to the viewers' attention.
[01:47:42.175 --> 01:47:43.275]  Anything else, son of Abraham?
[01:47:44.055 --> 01:47:44.896]  That's going to be all, man.
[01:47:45.176 --> 01:47:46.176]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[01:47:46.196 --> 01:47:46.456]  God bless you.
[01:47:46.476 --> 01:47:47.176]  Appreciate everything you do.
[01:47:47.476 --> 01:47:47.837]  Thank you.
[01:47:48.237 --> 01:47:49.557]  Tyson in Kansas, go ahead.
[01:47:51.358 --> 01:47:51.698]  Hi, Alex.
[01:47:52.839 --> 01:48:05.701]  I just wanted to bring up something that I haven't said as much lately, but the other day I was tuned into my U.S.
[01:48:05.921 --> 01:48:15.043]  Senator representative's livestream, Senator Roger Marshall from Kansas, and somebody posed the question on the livestream.
[01:48:16.503 --> 01:48:20.844]  They said, you know, Roger Marshall, what are we going to do about the fentanyl being smuggled across the border?
[01:48:21.633 --> 01:48:23.935]  And his reaction was, yes, we're working on it.
[01:48:25.376 --> 01:48:27.318]  Currently legislation, U.S.
[01:48:27.358 --> 01:48:46.860]   legislation is working on some bills that are going to basically allow local law enforcement to Work with social media platforms to hand over information and from direct message and private messages to try to get ahead on that.
[01:48:47.521 --> 01:48:53.363]  And you know, it just really is a process instead of sanctioning China and shutting down the border.
[01:48:54.764 --> 01:48:55.244]  That's right.
[01:48:55.704 --> 01:49:07.564]   And it really like in my mind, it connects pretty well with The PayPal surveillance that, you know, they basically have already admitted almost seeming like a distraction.
[01:49:09.265 --> 01:49:24.793]  You know, I definitely don't want any, you know, you don't want immigrants coming across the border, but I just kind of want to give out that buyer beware disclaimer that I think that some of these immigration policies that are coming to the forefront are kind of a ruse.
[01:49:25.273 --> 01:49:25.793]  Oh, yeah.
[01:49:25.893 --> 01:49:26.914]  Alien dialectic.
[01:49:27.214 --> 01:49:28.895]  Create the problem, offer the solution.
[01:49:28.935 --> 01:49:29.315]  I totally agree.
[01:49:30.848 --> 01:49:31.368]  Absolutely.
[01:49:31.428 --> 01:49:34.749]  We don't need to get rid of our Bill of Rights and Constitution to protect ourselves.
[01:49:34.829 --> 01:49:37.090]  We need to keep it and make them enforce the law.
[01:49:38.730 --> 01:49:39.350]  Absolutely.
[01:49:39.491 --> 01:49:40.251]  I totally agree.
[01:49:40.571 --> 01:49:45.912]  And then real quick, I guess I could bring up Elon Musk buying out Twitter.
[01:49:45.932 --> 01:49:58.296]  You know, I think, I'm not sure if he's, you know, obviously if he goes through with the things that he says and making everything free for everybody to communicate, that would be great.
[01:49:58.988 --> 01:50:15.960]  But at the same time, you know, with the Neuralink, you know, and the transhumanist agenda that he's basically pushing himself, it makes me think about, is he in direct competition with Mark Zuckerberg in the metaverse?
[01:50:16.020 --> 01:50:16.740]  Exactly.
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:18.181]  He says a lot of good things.
[01:50:18.782 --> 01:50:19.762]  He does a lot of bad things.
[01:50:19.782 --> 01:50:21.223]  So I support him in the good stuff he does.
[01:50:21.684 --> 01:50:22.785]  I don't support him in the bad stuff.
[01:50:22.825 --> 01:50:23.365]  Thank you so much.
[01:50:23.425 --> 01:50:24.366]  Amazing points, Tyson.
[01:50:24.926 --> 01:50:25.246]  All right.
[01:50:25.947 --> 01:50:26.607]  We're gonna come back.
[01:50:26.667 --> 01:50:27.368]  We got a caller.
[01:50:28.769 --> 01:50:30.310]  That caller from Brazil just hung up.
[01:50:30.370 --> 01:50:31.090]  I was about to go to them.
[01:50:31.790 --> 01:50:32.170]  Oh, no, no.
[01:50:32.230 --> 01:50:33.591]  David's up next from Brazil.
[01:50:34.251 --> 01:50:35.591]  Then David in Texas and others.
[01:50:35.651 --> 01:50:37.372]  David in Brazil, stay there.
[01:50:37.392 --> 01:50:41.994]  We're going to talk to the land of Bolsonaro straight ahead when we come back.
[01:50:43.614 --> 01:50:48.256]  So, real raw people are calling into the broadcast, giving their ideas, their points.
[01:50:48.836 --> 01:50:50.497]  Something the establishment does not like.
[01:50:51.177 --> 01:50:54.438]  So it seems like a simple thing we're doing, but it's what the enemy cannot stand.
[01:50:54.758 --> 01:50:56.038]  We're doing it live here today.
[01:50:56.399 --> 01:50:57.299]  So honored you've joined us.
[01:50:58.032 --> 01:50:59.713]  All right, let's go to David in Brazil.
[01:50:59.773 --> 01:51:00.493]  David, you're on the air.
[01:51:00.533 --> 01:51:00.913]  Go ahead.
[01:51:02.934 --> 01:51:03.395]  Hi, Alex.
[01:51:03.415 --> 01:51:03.975]  Can you hear me?
[01:51:04.355 --> 01:51:04.635]  I can.
[01:51:04.675 --> 01:51:08.897]  Go ahead.
[01:51:09.137 --> 01:51:14.260]  Well, some weeks ago, I saw the Economist headline.
[01:51:14.693 --> 01:51:22.372]   cover headlines saying Bolsonaro, the man who would be Trump, Bolsonaro preparing the big lie in Brazil.
[01:51:22.372 --> 01:51:30.052]   I saw that headline and I saw the whole article unfold before me, even before I even read it.
[01:51:30.052 --> 01:51:32.132]  Of course, you know what they mean.
[01:51:32.602 --> 01:51:35.163]  That Bolsonaro is going to lose the election.
[01:51:35.463 --> 01:51:37.924]  He's going to claim there was election fraud.
[01:51:38.405 --> 01:51:41.886]  And then, of course, they're going to say, oh, this is a big lie.
[01:51:42.186 --> 01:51:43.967]  He's just going to be like Trump.
[01:51:44.047 --> 01:51:45.468]  He's a sore loser.
[01:51:45.808 --> 01:51:51.271]  And then they're going to immediately de-platform him from all, I mean, all big tech.
[01:51:51.611 --> 01:51:54.212]  And, you know, this is the scripted thing.
[01:51:54.272 --> 01:51:56.333]  This is what's going to happen if he loses.
[01:51:56.713 --> 01:52:10.894]   Of course, when I initially saw that headline, My election fraud, let's say, meter went to DEFCON 2, DEFCON 1 being the election fraud itself.
[01:52:11.534 --> 01:52:30.962]   Fortunately, it seems that the fake polls that they had been peddling before the election weren't able to match the actual results because Bolsonaro actually got quite near Lula did not win in the first round, like they said.
[01:52:31.182 --> 01:52:32.803]  Of course, the polls were wrong.
[01:52:32.623 --> 01:52:38.143]   wrong. Of course there was a... Let's say... That's right, for those that don't know, they said Bolsonaro was 20
[01:52:38.143 --> 01:52:42.462]   points ahead, he only lost by 6-7 points and now they have a runoff.
[01:52:42.462 --> 01:52:46.462]   Absolutely, so there's a definite fraud going on and they don't want fraud being questioned.
[01:52:46.462 --> 01:52:56.783]   Yeah, I would say that Brazil has got the, let's say, the electoral system in Brazil. Of course we've got the
[01:52:56.783 --> 01:52:58.462]  electronic ballot boxes.
[01:52:58.923 --> 01:52:59.844]  That's not very good.
[01:53:00.364 --> 01:53:09.852]  But the point is that some people said, oh, they stole the election at the counting level.
[01:53:10.032 --> 01:53:18.502]   Unfortunately, that's not really possible, because in Brazil, they have to pay Exactly.
[01:53:18.362 --> 01:53:22.521]  report at the door of the polling stations in Brazil.
[01:53:22.521 --> 01:53:32.521]   So any actual fraud must, absolutely must be done at the ballot box level, flipping
[01:53:32.521 --> 01:53:34.521]  the votes as people vote.
[01:53:34.521 --> 01:53:35.521]  You cannot...
[01:53:35.521 --> 01:53:36.521]  Exactly.
[01:53:36.521 --> 01:53:40.921]   Notice how the international banks, the whole power structure is backing Bolsonaro's communist
[01:53:40.921 --> 01:53:41.921]  competitor.
[01:53:41.921 --> 01:53:42.922]  Yeah.
[01:53:42.922 --> 01:53:43.922]  Of course, they...
[01:53:43.922 --> 01:53:45.922]  Of course, Amy.
[01:53:45.597 --> 01:53:52.445]  The big point is that I think the guy that is going to be in power is actually the Vice President, Alckmin.
[01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:56.322]  Because Lula is just the guy that has got the vote.
[01:53:56.802 --> 01:54:04.406]  When he's done, they're going to put the World Economic Forum puppet Alckmin in because he's going to be the Great Reset guy.
[01:54:04.506 --> 01:54:10.730]  And speaking of Great Reset, I've got the great book here right beside me, Alex Jones, The Great Reset.
[01:54:11.190 --> 01:54:12.751]  Congratulations for this book.
[01:54:13.331 --> 01:54:17.173]  Unfortunately, most people in Brazil are not ready for this kind of information.
[01:54:17.853 --> 01:54:21.435]  We're still mostly at the left-right paradigm.
[01:54:24.075 --> 01:54:30.718]  Okay, that's the point, because the problem is that we have communism right at our gate, right?
[01:54:30.879 --> 01:54:35.181]  Because we've got Venezuela and Argentina now turning communist.
[01:54:35.781 --> 01:54:39.344]  For those who don't know, Brazil's got more resources than the U.S.
[01:54:39.844 --> 01:54:44.947]  Brazil could be the superpower of the Western Hemisphere, and it just needs to be turned loose.
[01:54:47.045 --> 01:54:55.109]  Yes, yes, and unfortunately Brazil, they say, oh Brazil was the country of the future and unfortunately it seems that the future never comes, see?
[01:54:55.989 --> 01:55:17.122]   And unfortunately Bolsonaro is still... I remember something that you said When Biden was set to win, you said on your show, actually, it doesn't matter whether Biden wins, because if Trump gets elected, the American people will still be asleep, thinking that they are in command.
[01:55:17.142 --> 01:55:18.802]  Same thing with Bolsonaro.
[01:55:19.042 --> 01:55:21.383]  I think Bolsonaro wins, OK.
[01:55:21.743 --> 01:55:24.664]  He keeps abandoning the deep state and losing.
[01:55:24.704 --> 01:55:25.784]  That's the problem.
[01:55:26.144 --> 01:55:27.464]  I mean, because... Well, that's right.
[01:55:27.504 --> 01:55:29.065]  In a way, it's better to make it worse.
[01:55:29.125 --> 01:55:30.545]  But man, I tell you, it's crazy.
[01:55:32.096 --> 01:55:37.758]  Well, that's the problem, because elections have consequences, unfortunately.
[01:55:37.818 --> 01:55:46.220]  You don't know whether you're going to be able to get the World Economic Forum out of office once they have stolen one election.
[01:55:46.820 --> 01:56:06.447]   But, of course, I would say that from the result of the first round of elections, my, let's say, election fog meter dropped to DEF CON 3, because Bolsonaro actually gained ground on On the major, let's say, Lula,
[01:56:08.419 --> 01:56:23.948]  Well, I gotta say, I mean, Bolsonaro's come out against the vaccine.
[01:56:24.008 --> 01:56:26.470]  He is as good as it gets, and what a blessing.
[01:56:27.230 --> 01:56:29.952]  And, you know, I just pray for him because he's been under such attack.
[01:56:30.312 --> 01:56:31.252]  Thank you so much, David.
[01:56:31.273 --> 01:56:32.133]  Amazing from Brazil.
[01:56:33.634 --> 01:56:34.675]  What a smart caller, man.
[01:56:35.035 --> 01:56:35.855]  We're so blessed to be here.
[01:56:35.875 --> 01:56:36.556]  This is so amazing.
[01:56:37.413 --> 01:56:39.855]  Let's talk to David in Texas, a little bit closer than Brazil.
[01:56:39.875 --> 01:56:40.896]  Go ahead, David.
[01:56:41.757 --> 01:56:42.378]  Yeah, hey, Alex.
[01:56:42.418 --> 01:56:43.539]  Been listening to you for years.
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:47.262]  Basically, I was opting out of everything COVID.
[01:56:47.282 --> 01:56:48.403]  I don't do the vaccine.
[01:56:48.443 --> 01:56:49.264]  I don't do the test.
[01:56:49.344 --> 01:56:53.207]  It didn't take me long to catch on that it was all, you know, something was wrong with it.
[01:56:53.267 --> 01:56:55.309]  Even the masks, I stopped very early on.
[01:56:55.329 --> 01:56:58.632]  And if I needed them on, I wouldn't go into whatever business it was.
[01:56:59.052 --> 01:57:02.055]  With that said, I was as opted out as you can get.
[01:57:03.155 --> 01:57:09.817]  I got hit in February by a truck walking my dog down a sidewalk, which we think he hit me on purpose, but that's a separate thing.
[01:57:10.257 --> 01:57:23.520]  But what they got me with in the hospital that I never would have okayed was tetanus, diphtheria, typhoid, cellular pertosis vaccine, which I'm not worried as much about that as, well I am, as this.
[01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:25.580]  Because I never would have okayed this.
[01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:28.021]  HC specimen collection COVID-19 non-CDC.
[01:57:30.555 --> 01:57:32.557]  I never would have given Gates my DNA.
[01:57:32.737 --> 01:57:34.559]  I never would have surrendered my DNA.
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:50.715]  So my question is, is that specimen, because from what I understand from what you've said, there's an antigen test, which is the home test, the rapid test, which may not go to the CDC, but it's the PCR test that is the dangerous one where the gel gets into your brain.
[01:57:51.595 --> 01:57:55.616]  Uh, with that metallic substance and then that goes to Bill Gates and the CDC.
[01:57:55.636 --> 01:57:56.016]  Yes.
[01:57:56.116 --> 01:58:00.617]  How, how deep in a hole have I non-voluntarily gotten myself?
[01:58:00.717 --> 01:58:03.898]  And is there anything I can do to detox from this?
[01:58:03.918 --> 01:58:10.640]  Because like you said, if we can't stand up to this little, I mean, it's minute in comparison to what's coming.
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:15.101]  If I can't stand up to this, like you said, I can't stand up to what's coming.
[01:58:15.681 --> 01:58:16.822]  Well, David, there's no way.
[01:58:17.162 --> 01:58:18.062]  It's a great question.
[01:58:18.082 --> 01:58:19.763]  There's no way I could accurately answer that.
[01:58:20.163 --> 01:58:20.963]  You know more than I do.
[01:58:21.003 --> 01:58:21.803]  You experienced it.
[01:58:21.843 --> 01:58:24.584]  But most of this is badly coordinated.
[01:58:24.945 --> 01:58:26.705]  It's mainly about them taking over your body.
[01:58:27.205 --> 01:58:29.266]  And in most of the cases, it's not even a real shot.
[01:58:29.666 --> 01:58:34.508]  In most of the cases, they're not poisoning you with the testing they're doing.
[01:58:34.928 --> 01:58:36.789]  So it's all badly coordinated.
[01:58:36.829 --> 01:58:39.390]  It's basically their bum rush of humanity.
[01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:40.150]  It's a beta test.
[01:58:40.170 --> 01:58:49.280]   So, I mean, if you're not feeling sick, if you're not really feeling bad, then Looks like you dodged the bullets, but I mean, I really, I can't, I can't analyze this from afar.
[01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:52.962]  Yes, sir, and I do take your supplements and your iodine.
[01:58:53.022 --> 01:58:55.163]  Everything you say about the iodine is correct.
[01:58:55.203 --> 01:58:57.185]  My energy levels are much higher.
[01:58:57.465 --> 01:58:59.506]  Can I ask you a second part question real quick?
[01:58:59.526 --> 01:58:59.786]  Go ahead.
[01:59:00.707 --> 01:59:08.712]  My mom did wear the mask for a short period of time, and since then, she's had a chronic cough, and we literally, the other day, got the flu.
[01:59:08.732 --> 01:59:10.073]  Usually, that's bacterial pneumonia.
[01:59:10.805 --> 01:59:11.605]  That's what I thought.
[01:59:11.666 --> 01:59:20.190]  So we've got your lung cleanse and we're trying to get something from the doctor that isn't just a, what do you call it, something just to cover the symptoms.
[01:59:20.610 --> 01:59:23.832]  They finally... Well, I know doctor, but she probably needs antibiotics.
[01:59:24.492 --> 01:59:29.415]  I'm not a big antibiotics fan, but I mean, they admit like most, the kids are all getting sick from the mask.
[01:59:29.715 --> 01:59:30.656]  It's bacterial pneumonia.
[01:59:30.876 --> 01:59:31.656]  It's a face diaper.
[01:59:31.936 --> 01:59:33.037]  You're not meant to be doing that.
[01:59:33.417 --> 01:59:39.280]  It's a whole other discussion, but your mom probably needs to, you know, to take antibiotics or colloidal silver.
[01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:39.841]  Thanks for the call.
[01:59:40.561 --> 01:59:42.124]  And again, I can't diagnose them from afar.
[01:59:42.164 --> 01:59:42.805]  I'm not a doctor.
[01:59:42.825 --> 01:59:45.208]  I just read all the news constantly and know what they're doing.
[01:59:45.829 --> 01:59:50.256]  I mean, there is just record viral infections, record death, all tied to the vaccine.
[01:59:51.488 --> 01:59:52.188]  And so much more.
[01:59:52.828 --> 01:59:57.090]  All right, Russell in California, you are up next.
[01:59:57.110 --> 01:59:59.050]  And then we'll go to everybody else.
[01:59:59.150 --> 02:00:04.772]  Polly, Davis, Xander, Jason, Patriot, Bruce, Vaughn, Bryce.
[02:00:04.832 --> 02:00:07.613]  We're gonna take every one of your calls ahead of Mike Adams.
[02:00:07.633 --> 02:00:10.454]  All right, we're about to go right back to your phone calls.
[02:00:12.075 --> 02:00:13.835]  And then Mike Adams takes over.
[02:00:15.696 --> 02:00:18.557]  We're doing a special broadcast from 8 a.m.
[02:00:21.013 --> 02:00:28.437]  Right through my show and right through Owen's show and the American Journal to midnight tomorrow night with a bunch of special guests.
[02:00:29.038 --> 02:00:31.479]  It's the same InfoWars extended emergency broadcast.
[02:00:32.059 --> 02:00:34.881]  InfoWars.com forward slash show on Wednesday, October 12th.
[02:00:35.721 --> 02:00:38.563]  And we got a bunch of special guests that I'll be announcing tomorrow.
[02:00:38.583 --> 02:00:41.425]  So I'm asking the listeners to take tomorrow out.
[02:00:42.598 --> 02:00:43.098]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:00:43.118 --> 02:00:44.199]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:00:44.038 --> 02:00:52.338]   and band up video or post our link on your own website so it gets past the censors and send that link out.
[02:00:52.338 --> 02:00:56.797]   Whatever you do, take action because it's an information war.
[02:00:56.797 --> 02:00:58.957]  All right, let's go back to your calls.
[02:00:58.957 --> 02:01:02.038]  Up next is Russell in California.
[02:01:02.038 --> 02:01:04.038]  Russell, thanks for calling.
[02:01:04.038 --> 02:01:04.998]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[02:01:04.998 --> 02:01:06.198]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:01:06.198 --> 02:01:07.398]  Thank you.
[02:01:07.398 --> 02:01:14.599]   This discussion you brought up a few years ago And I'd like to highlight it for you.
[02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:27.040]  Some people I know who work for the Border Patrol are telling me that there is a large contingency of combat-age young men crossing the border.
[02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:30.743]  Oh, there's countless videos of thousands of men in camo climbing over.
[02:01:31.584 --> 02:01:31.804]  Yes.
[02:01:32.385 --> 02:01:36.368]  And what it is, is these guys are fish out of water.
[02:01:36.768 --> 02:01:37.749]  They have no skills.
[02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:43.940]   They're coming into a country That's having, you know, higher gas prices and everything.
[02:01:44.381 --> 02:01:49.162]  I have a landscaper, a contractor who lives next door to me.
[02:01:49.663 --> 02:01:54.705]  He has five to eight illegal aliens coming to him looking for work.
[02:01:55.125 --> 02:01:57.966]  And he had to cut back because of gasoline prices and other things.
[02:01:58.866 --> 02:02:05.929]  Now, one of the things I want to bring up is that if you remember, Barack Obama needed a domestic police force.
[02:02:08.235 --> 02:02:13.699]  Also, you brought up the fact that they were going to create another Green Police.
[02:02:14.579 --> 02:02:33.353]  So, what is the possibility of the federal government hiring all these uneducated young men who have no job skills coming into this country and offering them federal jobs in those particular occupations?
[02:02:37.159 --> 02:02:45.183]  Well, there's no doubt that Obama said we need a domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military, and now that's what they're preparing.
[02:02:45.203 --> 02:02:48.324]  They're bringing in groups that won't have jobs for the future, but they can control it.
[02:02:48.344 --> 02:02:49.225]  I think you're absolutely right.
[02:02:50.385 --> 02:02:54.827]  Yeah, because they have no history or loyalty to the United States.
[02:02:55.668 --> 02:03:01.010]  Well, I think it's bigger than that, but I definitely think they're going to use the illegals to drive down the wages and break down society.
[02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.851]  I mean, there's no doubt.
[02:03:02.591 --> 02:03:12.655]   Well, yeah, when you hear defund the police and some of these other Organizations who want the police to be something other than a police force.
[02:03:13.415 --> 02:03:15.638]  Yeah, all they're doing there is they're not going to get rid of the police.
[02:03:15.658 --> 02:03:17.099]  They want to take control of the police.
[02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:18.441]  Great points, Russell.
[02:03:18.741 --> 02:03:20.583]  I think they found the clip of Obama saying it.
[02:03:21.524 --> 02:03:22.004]  This is in...
[02:03:24.295 --> 02:03:28.136]  We're going to play the clip here in just a moment because it just illustrates it all.
[02:03:28.156 --> 02:03:34.618]  This has been a long-term plan, and now we have Chinese Communist government, police forces in the U.S.
[02:03:35.318 --> 02:03:41.320]  in more than 30 cities and in more than 20 cities in Canada and in Europe, Communist Chinese police.
[02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:42.320]  They go, yeah, we're here.
[02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:43.960]  We're to watch our citizens.
[02:03:44.421 --> 02:03:45.101]  Do we have U.S.
[02:03:45.121 --> 02:03:47.341]  police force in China to watch U.S.
[02:03:47.381 --> 02:03:47.802]  citizens?
[02:03:47.862 --> 02:04:04.273]   I mean, this is, again, They're breaking the norms, they're getting us used to just more and more insanity, like PayPal saying, oh, you criticize the government or question elections, we're going to fine you $2,500 outside of government, outside of law.
[02:04:05.956 --> 02:04:06.857]  It's a power grab.
[02:04:06.877 --> 02:04:08.018]  People are like, this doesn't make sense.
[02:04:08.058 --> 02:04:08.918]  It's totalitarian.
[02:04:09.699 --> 02:04:10.199]  Exactly.
[02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:12.341]  That's the season we're in.
[02:04:12.841 --> 02:04:15.463]  They're doing whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want.
[02:04:15.603 --> 02:04:16.884]  It's a power grab.
[02:04:17.165 --> 02:04:17.765]  Here's Obama.
[02:04:18.345 --> 02:04:25.491]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[02:04:26.110 --> 02:04:32.270]   We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:35.470]  just as well funded.
[02:04:35.470 --> 02:04:40.390]  And remember the new world order.
[02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:41.911]  Polly in Canada.
[02:04:41.911 --> 02:04:45.470]  Welcome Polly, thanks for calling.
[02:04:45.496 --> 02:04:53.579]  Yes, that's Holly with an H. I discovered something in April and I was wondering how it would come to play for my home province.
[02:04:53.639 --> 02:04:54.139]  I'm a Newfie.
[02:04:54.159 --> 02:04:55.039]  I'm from Newfoundland.
[02:04:55.659 --> 02:04:57.060]  And I'm back at the moment.
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:04:58.900]  I've been back for a few months.
[02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:04.502]  My husband's in Florida and I'm going back on Friday, so I just can't wait to get back to Florida to be honest.
[02:05:04.922 --> 02:05:13.853]   I discovered this document called You call it the Local Paradox and Grand Policy Scheme Lessons from Newfoundland and Labrador.
[02:05:13.873 --> 02:05:16.755]  It's published in the Scandinavian Journal of Management.
[02:05:17.435 --> 02:05:20.077]  You can find it on Science Direct and ResearchScape.
[02:05:20.117 --> 02:05:22.859]  You'll have to pay a little bit to get it, but you can verify it.
[02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:31.606]  I also have uploaded it in several places, and you can find it on Twitter under the hashtag localparadox.
[02:05:32.006 --> 02:05:40.926]   Basically, it's kind of taken in the a great reset and they're starting to focus in on what they're
[02:05:40.926 --> 02:05:46.146]   going to do locally, Alex, is what I would say. What they say in the document, it says
[02:05:46.146 --> 02:05:50.916]   the function local governance needs resources. Basically, to convince the people of this
[02:05:50.916 --> 02:05:56.625]   plan, they're going to have to go ahead and convince the local people. I think they're starting to
[02:05:56.625 --> 02:06:00.605]  hit a bit of a snag.
[02:06:00.605 --> 02:06:06.846]   You're talking about agenda 2030 is the program to get us to accept it.
[02:06:06.241 --> 02:06:07.782]  Yeah, the global government takeover.
[02:06:08.902 --> 02:06:09.283]  Right on.
[02:06:09.423 --> 02:06:15.987]  And in this article, the University article, it was authored by a guy named Robert Greenwood of Memorial University.
[02:06:16.027 --> 02:06:18.128]  That's the university here in the province of Newfoundland.
[02:06:18.829 --> 02:06:31.777]   And under the article, in folder keywords, actually, in fact, lists the Great Reset and into the article, the the reference book, it lists Klaus Schwab's great recent
[02:06:31.777 --> 02:06:36.856]   book directly. I would really like you to read this piece of information Alex because right now my
[02:06:36.856 --> 02:06:43.527]   area here called the Port-au-Port Peninsula we're currently being invaded by giant wind turbines. They're
[02:06:43.527 --> 02:06:47.337]   planning for 164 of them to be installed on the Port-au-Port Peninsula
[02:06:47.337 --> 02:06:52.807]   and it's going to take up about 50% of the crown land. Hey, I hear you. Everybody's getting
[02:06:52.807 --> 02:06:55.498]   hit by the new order. I'm glad you called. Thank you so much.
[02:06:55.498 --> 02:07:00.467]   I want to talk to Jason Xander, Damis, Patriot, Bruce, Von, Bryce. I'm gonna try to

[02:08:21.851 --> 02:08:23.091]  Hey Al, how you doing today?
[02:08:23.932 --> 02:08:24.892]  In the middle of the war, brother.
[02:08:26.113 --> 02:08:26.333]  Yeah.
[02:08:26.792 --> 02:08:29.113]  Well, I was listening to your show earlier.
[02:08:29.133 --> 02:08:30.594]  I've been listening to it for many years.
[02:08:30.774 --> 02:08:31.655]  First time caller.
[02:08:32.015 --> 02:08:32.996]  I figured I'd better call.
[02:08:33.016 --> 02:08:34.657]  We only got the countdown, so.
[02:08:35.657 --> 02:08:40.480]  I'm out here in Pennsylvania, and who knows if we're going to survive this attack they're going to drop on us, so.
[02:08:41.601 --> 02:08:43.222]  I want to thank you for everything you've done.
[02:08:43.262 --> 02:08:44.322]  It's been a hell of a fight.
[02:08:45.443 --> 02:08:47.664]  And, uh, I think we got them on the run, man.
[02:08:47.684 --> 02:08:49.285]  They are like a rabid raccoon.
[02:08:50.186 --> 02:08:50.706]  In the corner.
[02:08:51.106 --> 02:08:52.467]  They're going to pull something big.
[02:08:53.768 --> 02:08:55.809]  And, uh, we all know it, so.
[02:08:57.341 --> 02:08:59.783]  I don't know what else we can do, but get ready and God bless.
[02:09:00.903 --> 02:09:01.364]  I agree with you.
[02:09:01.384 --> 02:09:02.244]  I'm at the same place.
[02:09:02.304 --> 02:09:07.808]  Just tell your family you love them and pray to God and we've done the best job we could and spread the word, but just know it's coming down.
[02:09:08.748 --> 02:09:09.408]  That's right, man.
[02:09:09.529 --> 02:09:13.151]  Thank you so much for everything you've done and I'm glad I was able to get on here.
[02:09:13.451 --> 02:09:14.792]  Jason, I'm glad to get to talk to you.
[02:09:15.412 --> 02:09:16.373]  I feel the same way, brother.
[02:09:16.813 --> 02:09:17.834]  I really appreciate what you said.
[02:09:17.874 --> 02:09:18.774]  I really feel what you're saying.
[02:09:20.055 --> 02:09:22.657]  In case we'll ever see each other again, it's good to know you.
[02:09:23.704 --> 02:09:24.365]  That's where we're at.
[02:09:24.905 --> 02:09:26.526]  We may turn this around, but it's bad.
[02:09:26.907 --> 02:09:27.267]  It's bad.
[02:09:27.407 --> 02:09:27.988]  Let's not lie.
[02:09:28.308 --> 02:09:28.968]  Let's just get real.
[02:09:30.049 --> 02:09:31.671]  Let's talk to Vaughn in California.
[02:09:31.711 --> 02:09:32.571]  Vaughn, welcome.
[02:09:33.972 --> 02:09:35.954]  Hello, thank you for taking the call.
[02:09:36.955 --> 02:09:45.082]  I just wanted to talk about, you know, who really cares about Kanye right now when World War III is about to be about to pop off, potentially?
[02:09:46.343 --> 02:09:52.505]   Everyone just needs to get ready, get right with God, and Just be with family.
[02:09:52.965 --> 02:09:53.846]  That's about it.
[02:09:53.986 --> 02:09:55.467]  That's pretty much all I got.
[02:09:57.489 --> 02:09:58.809]  VMStalkshow.com.
[02:09:59.370 --> 02:10:00.371]  He's only 14.
[02:10:00.591 --> 02:10:01.531]  Doing a great job.
[02:10:01.551 --> 02:10:07.776]  You know, if I was anything like him at 14, I mean, yeah.
[02:10:08.516 --> 02:10:10.878]  Is this a young commentator you're talking about?
[02:10:11.979 --> 02:10:12.399]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:12.939 --> 02:10:13.960]  What's the call sign again?
[02:10:15.341 --> 02:10:19.444]  His website is VMStalkshow.com and his name is Vinker.
[02:10:20.143 --> 02:10:20.924]  Amazing.
[02:10:21.364 --> 02:10:22.225]  Amazing points.
[02:10:22.325 --> 02:10:23.146]  Thank you, sir.
[02:10:23.166 --> 02:10:28.671]  All right, I'm going to jam in a few final calls, but I'm not going to cut into Mike Adams because he's on the warpath.
[02:10:29.032 --> 02:10:30.533]  We'll be right back with our number four.
[02:10:30.553 --> 02:10:37.180]  All right, final segment before Mike Adams takes over here on this Tuesday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:38.941]  David in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:10:38.981 --> 02:10:39.622]  Thanks for calling.
[02:10:40.923 --> 02:10:41.684]  Alex, can you hear me?
[02:10:42.004 --> 02:10:42.465]  I can, brother.
[02:10:43.610 --> 02:10:43.850]  Awesome.
[02:10:43.870 --> 02:10:45.171]  It's so good to talk to you finally.
[02:10:45.771 --> 02:10:46.912]  You're mentioning real callers.
[02:10:47.413 --> 02:10:48.753]  Let me tell you about the real.
[02:10:49.254 --> 02:10:53.536]  I'm an ex-Democrat in recovery under the Republican Party.
[02:10:54.597 --> 02:11:00.261]  I woke up right around the same time I got sober and I think that had a lot to do with my new beliefs.
[02:11:01.001 --> 02:11:07.405]  And man, I used to call you when I was like 9 or 10, like 20 years ago on your show on the Public Access Channel.
[02:11:08.526 --> 02:11:09.527]  And now here we are.
[02:11:11.410 --> 02:11:14.692]  I agree, but the Republicans aren't perfect either.
[02:11:15.113 --> 02:11:16.974]  It's just they're a little bit better than Democrats.
[02:11:17.034 --> 02:11:20.998]  So I want to be clear, it's not just like going for the Republicans is going to save us.
[02:11:21.378 --> 02:11:23.540]  It's just the fact is the Democrats are literally cancer.
[02:11:24.878 --> 02:11:25.798]  That's absolutely correct.
[02:11:26.199 --> 02:11:28.360]  It's just a less poisonous version of the same pill.
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:35.743]  I wanted to ask you, so those last two corners kind of tie in with this, except they seem a little somber.
[02:11:36.663 --> 02:11:40.125]  Lots of talk about the cyber attacks, national outage.
[02:11:40.365 --> 02:11:41.885]  What happens if the plan goes off?
[02:11:41.945 --> 02:11:43.386]  Like, I'm an Austin City dweller.
[02:11:43.426 --> 02:11:46.167]  Well, that's a whole other discussion, what happens if the power goes off.
[02:11:46.507 --> 02:11:47.788]  We should do some whole shows on that.
[02:11:48.188 --> 02:11:52.250]  The reason I know that's coming is they keep pre-programming you, telling you it's imminent.
[02:11:53.055 --> 02:11:56.299]  And then claiming the Russians are going to do it.
[02:11:56.539 --> 02:11:57.681]  So, that's why I'm worried about it.
[02:11:58.806 --> 02:12:00.367]  That's exactly what I'm thinking, too.
[02:12:00.427 --> 02:12:06.291]  There's a lot of warnings coming out from a lot of different outlets about that, and I'm just wondering, do you have a plan?
[02:12:06.311 --> 02:12:07.851]  Do you have a message to the people?
[02:12:08.292 --> 02:12:11.534]  I mean, I've been so busy fighting, I really don't have a plan.
[02:12:11.674 --> 02:12:15.936]  I mean, I try to have my tank full, I've got a place in the country to run to, a little bit of food there.
[02:12:16.056 --> 02:12:19.278]  I've been so busy on the offense, I don't have a defense brother.
[02:12:19.579 --> 02:12:21.700]  Good to have you with us, Davis.
[02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:22.760]  I love you and I appreciate you.
[02:12:22.781 --> 02:12:26.483]  All right, let's go ahead and take more calls here, going as fast as we can.
[02:12:28.024 --> 02:12:29.465]  Bryson Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:12:30.665 --> 02:12:31.466]  Hello?
[02:12:31.846 --> 02:12:34.367]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:12:35.688 --> 02:12:44.873]  My question is, in regards to the 2020 election, right, there's many people like me who genuinely think it was fraudulent.
[02:12:45.593 --> 02:12:58.759]   With that going forward, to elections in the future, what do you think we could do, or something that we could, I guess, use to justify that they would be Legit in the future.
[02:12:59.180 --> 02:13:04.962]  We have to end mail-in ballots other than absentee, where the person signs up for themselves.
[02:13:05.002 --> 02:13:06.503]  That's totally legitimate and a good thing.
[02:13:06.983 --> 02:13:11.345]  Absentee, you're going to be out of town, you're in the military, you go yourself, you file for it, you get it.
[02:13:11.765 --> 02:13:16.587]  But just randomly mailing out millions of ballots and letting them do it, the biggest thing we do is stop that fraud.
[02:13:17.807 --> 02:13:18.748]  Oh, I agree.
[02:13:19.468 --> 02:13:24.010]  I'll never forget watching the election with my brother, and at like 1 a.m.
[02:13:24.030 --> 02:13:26.811]  they stopped the counting and all these mail-in ballots come in.
[02:13:27.654 --> 02:13:30.335]  And for some reason they're all for Democrats.
[02:13:32.736 --> 02:13:35.236]  And they're saying the ultimate crime is questioning an election.
[02:13:35.857 --> 02:13:38.297]  No, we're going to continue to question no matter what they do to us.
[02:13:39.738 --> 02:13:40.378]  Oh, of course.
[02:13:41.878 --> 02:13:42.879]  But no, that's about it.
[02:13:42.919 --> 02:13:43.839]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:13:44.859 --> 02:13:45.680]  I appreciate you.
[02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:46.100]  All right.
[02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:48.820]  I got Bruce and I got Xander and I got a minute and a half left.
[02:13:49.661 --> 02:13:51.601]  Let's go to Bruce in Kentucky.
[02:13:51.641 --> 02:13:52.121]  Go ahead, Bruce.
[02:13:53.482 --> 02:13:53.642]  Yeah.
[02:13:54.882 --> 02:13:57.464]  Alex, I wanted to mention about the voters' election.
[02:13:58.025 --> 02:14:02.489]  I believe the elections will go on, but the problem is they haven't fixed the problems of 2020.
[02:14:02.549 --> 02:14:06.412]  They're still going to be using the machines that they can change and manipulate.
[02:14:07.012 --> 02:14:10.335]  So, it's not those they say who vote, but those who count the votes.
[02:14:10.816 --> 02:14:15.860]  So, I believe the loss is right there, unless we can change that around.
[02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:20.944]  And the second thing is the PCR test for the COVID or whatever.
[02:14:21.368 --> 02:14:24.793]  They got, the globalists now have most people's DNA a globalist.
[02:14:24.813 --> 02:14:25.354]  No, that's right.
[02:14:25.374 --> 02:14:25.995]  They admit it.
[02:14:26.035 --> 02:14:27.016]  We told them two years ago.
[02:14:27.036 --> 02:14:27.857]  It's a DNA test.
[02:14:28.258 --> 02:14:29.299]  The test is a fraud.
[02:14:29.359 --> 02:14:29.840]  Great point.
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:30.441]  God bless you.
[02:14:30.761 --> 02:14:31.743]  But, Jamin, one more call.
[02:14:31.763 --> 02:14:32.804]  Apologize for cutting you short.
[02:14:33.185 --> 02:14:34.166]  Xander in Wisconsin.
[02:14:34.206 --> 02:14:34.487]  Go ahead.
[02:14:35.612 --> 02:14:36.773]  Yeah, I'll be real quick.
[02:14:36.813 --> 02:14:52.225]  You said you like the wildcard calls, and I went to a Jesuit college, and the Jesuit priest would tell us in theology class that the way God parted the Red Sea for Moses is with his male member, and I think that's a lot of things lacking right now is the power of male energy.
[02:14:52.986 --> 02:15:06.997]   Tucker Carlson has highlighted in Christianity it's male and female genders, where in the Talmud they have multiple genders, like androgynous tum-tum, which is lacking sexual characteristics, Call me back, Xander.
[02:15:07.017 --> 02:15:10.318]  The great Mike Adams takes over now.
[02:15:10.159 --> 02:15:15.559]   Cyrus Adams and they're strikingly similar to LGBTQ. I'm not saying there
[02:15:15.559 --> 02:15:20.779]   shouldn't be LGBTQ stuff but I think the US majority of people would align more
[02:15:20.779 --> 02:15:27.038]   with... Call me back Xander. The great Mike Adams takes over now. Thank you Xander.

[02:16:35.478 --> 02:16:39.901]  All right, welcome folks to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show here on InfoWars.com.
[02:16:39.961 --> 02:16:48.606]  I'm Mike Adams, the health ranger from NaturalNews.com, and I'm going to be driving the train of information through this hour.
[02:16:48.966 --> 02:16:50.167]  We have a lot coming up.
[02:16:50.207 --> 02:16:51.408]  You're going to just be blown away.
[02:16:51.428 --> 02:16:57.011]  I've got a special guest joining us at the bottom of the hour that has, I think, a really special analysis.
[02:16:57.091 --> 02:16:57.912]  A first-time guest.
[02:16:58.592 --> 02:17:00.433]  You may not have heard from this person before.
[02:17:00.473 --> 02:17:04.216]  He's got a fantastic analysis of where things are going and how we win this.
[02:17:04.876 --> 02:17:16.000]  On a spiritual front, but getting just kind of from what Alex and a lot of the callers just said, yes, there is probably going to be a cyber attack false flag in the United States.
[02:17:16.060 --> 02:17:18.441]  It'll be carried out by the deep state to be blamed on Russia.
[02:17:19.221 --> 02:17:23.103]  And yes, in addition to that, at some point this war goes nuclear.
[02:17:23.863 --> 02:17:28.346]  And it seems like the United States will be struck by a nuclear weapon.
[02:17:28.866 --> 02:17:33.028]  That could be the Poseidon underwater nuclear drone that Russia has.
[02:17:33.068 --> 02:17:38.892]  They've deployed their massive submarine now that carries eight of these Poseidon weapon systems.
[02:17:39.392 --> 02:17:44.675]  And these can cause what's called the radioactive tidal wave to inundate coastal cities.
[02:17:45.295 --> 02:17:52.560]  And if you look at the geography of the power centers of the continental United States, you realize that the power centers are all along the coast.
[02:17:53.320 --> 02:18:05.735]  Of course, you've got Washington, D.C., you've got Norfolk, Virginia, you've got New York City, you know, the financial capital of America and so on, all within striking distance of a single nuclear detonation on the East Coast.
[02:18:06.316 --> 02:18:11.342]  And that would render those coastal areas uninhabitable for about three centuries, by the way.
[02:18:11.983 --> 02:18:23.513]  So it's not just the tidal wave, it's the fact that then the ocean water, which would be radioactive at that point, would deposit radioisotopes onto the land, quite a few miles inland.
[02:18:24.334 --> 02:18:27.837]  And those radioisotopes would be impossible to clear away.
[02:18:28.417 --> 02:18:36.424]  And they would render the entire area, again, uninhabitable for at least 300 years, because that's 10 half-lives of Cesium-137, by the way.
[02:18:36.865 --> 02:18:39.387]  You have to have 10 half-lives before it's really safe to go back.
[02:18:39.427 --> 02:18:49.396]  That's why Chernobyl, you can't move in to the park next to Chernobyl right now, not for, you know, almost 300 years, because it hasn't even been that long since, what was it, 1986.
[02:18:51.818 --> 02:18:56.925]  With that said, yes, you need to consider iodine.
[02:18:57.406 --> 02:18:57.927]  Absolutely.
[02:18:57.947 --> 02:18:59.850]  I 100% support that.
[02:19:01.512 --> 02:19:05.578]  If you don't have iodine, I don't know, you're crazy.
[02:19:05.598 --> 02:19:07.460]  You gotta get some, in my opinion.
[02:19:08.061 --> 02:19:12.505]  Well, iodine is going to be an incredible barter item as well, so check out InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:12.545 --> 02:19:14.787]  Just make sure you've got your supplies squared away.
[02:19:15.287 --> 02:19:21.953]  But in addition to the oral iodine, make sure you also have antiseptic first aid components.
[02:19:22.754 --> 02:19:28.278]  And that would include povidone iodine, by the way, which is not something you could drink or consume.
[02:19:28.999 --> 02:19:37.542]  But what a lot of people don't know is that if you apply povidone iodine to your skin, that it has a double acting effect.
[02:19:37.682 --> 02:19:40.923]  It actually absorbs some iodine through your skin as well.
[02:19:41.443 --> 02:19:46.845]  So you can actually, in an emergency, you can, in essence, take iodine through your skin.
[02:19:46.865 --> 02:19:52.386]  A lot of people don't know that, but it absorbs quite well through that vector as well.
[02:19:52.866 --> 02:19:55.867]  So also make sure you've got hydrogen peroxide.
[02:19:56.167 --> 02:19:57.788]  Make sure you've got isopropyl alcohol.
[02:19:58.289 --> 02:20:02.388]   These are things that are very easy to get, very inexpensive to get.
[02:20:02.388 --> 02:20:07.888]   You can just go out to a local pharmacy and get a lot of these things like the IPA or
[02:20:07.888 --> 02:20:13.548]   make sure you can get chlorine dioxide which makes a really nice antibacterial topical
[02:20:13.548 --> 02:20:14.988]  kind of spray.
[02:20:14.988 --> 02:20:18.769]  It also is used to kill bacteria in water supplies as well.
[02:20:18.769 --> 02:20:21.168]  So it's used in water filtration.
[02:20:21.168 --> 02:20:26.088]   So many of these things you're going to need because when the grid goes down, you're not
[02:20:26.088 --> 02:20:30.889]   going to have clean water anymore and a lot of the sewage systems that run these cities
[02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:32.569]  are going to stop working.
[02:20:32.569 --> 02:20:38.429]   So you're going to have overflowing raw sewage in every major city, not just San Francisco
[02:20:38.429 --> 02:20:39.648]  which is where it is now.
[02:20:39.763 --> 02:20:46.529]  I'm talking about every city in America, because when the sewage system stops working, but people keep flushing, guess what happens?
[02:20:46.549 --> 02:20:51.414]  It becomes a very ugly situation and a very unsanitary situation very, very quickly.
[02:20:51.794 --> 02:21:02.750]   You're going to start to have a lot of deaths from cholera, and just, you know, sort of I don't know, 17th century types of diseases from a lack of basic sanitation, a lack of plumbing, and so on.
[02:21:03.191 --> 02:21:05.395]  So, you're gonna need to be prepared for that.
[02:21:06.385 --> 02:21:10.907]  You need to be prepared for a low-tech survival scenario.
[02:21:11.067 --> 02:21:12.767]  I've actually done a whole book on this.
[02:21:12.947 --> 02:21:14.508]  It's a free audio book.
[02:21:14.548 --> 02:21:16.349]  If you want to download it, by the way, it's free.
[02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:18.529]  It's at resilientprepping.com.
[02:21:18.549 --> 02:21:22.931]  I talk about low-tech solutions and no-tech solutions.
[02:21:22.971 --> 02:21:28.433]  If you want to learn how to survive without any technology, which I think is necessary, that's what happens when the grid goes down.
[02:21:29.053 --> 02:21:33.917]  There are ways to do that with food, medicine, money, shelter, all of it.
[02:21:33.997 --> 02:21:35.759]  You can live without electricity.
[02:21:36.159 --> 02:21:46.829]  Not going to be fun, not a pretty scenario, and most people probably won't live through it because they don't know what to do when the lights go off, but you, the InfoWars listener, you know, you're well aware.
[02:21:46.889 --> 02:21:51.012]  You're probably more prepared than 999 out of a thousand people.
[02:21:51.373 --> 02:21:55.777]  So yes, you can make it through this, but you need to get information and get well prepared.
[02:21:56.861 --> 02:22:09.529]  By the way, as a programming note, I've been posting my daily podcast now to Band.Video on the InfoWars platform, so you can get everything that I'm doing, all the interviews I'm doing, and so on, at Band.Video.
[02:22:09.569 --> 02:22:11.730]  Just look for Mike Adams there on that channel.
[02:22:12.171 --> 02:22:17.454]  I did an interview last night that just got posted today, which is related to the topic here.
[02:22:17.474 --> 02:22:20.356]  I interviewed Ben Armstrong from The New American.
[02:22:20.936 --> 02:22:34.659]  And Ben Armstrong had a fascinating analysis of the Book of Revelation, and he believes, based on his analysis, that New York City is Babylon, as is described in, I believe, Chapter 18 of the Book of Revelation.
[02:22:34.679 --> 02:22:37.299]  It starts in Chapter 17 and then segues into Chapter 18.
[02:22:38.119 --> 02:22:49.625]   And for those of you familiar with Scripture, you know that the great city of Babylon, the city of all the riches and all the trade and the world's hub for importing and exporting, The city falls in one hour.
[02:22:50.065 --> 02:22:58.157]  It falls into ruin while the ship captains are off the coast of the city looking at a smoking ruin as the city is completely destroyed.
[02:22:59.204 --> 02:23:06.749]  Well, according to Ben Armstrong, who is quite a scholar in this area, he's been studying this for more than 20 years.
[02:23:07.590 --> 02:23:10.131]  He believes that New York City is Babylon.
[02:23:10.912 --> 02:23:13.814]  And by the way, he's not arguing with people who have a different interpretation.
[02:23:13.834 --> 02:23:15.095]  He's just adding another layer.
[02:23:15.515 --> 02:23:17.676]  So it's okay to have different interpretations on all this.
[02:23:17.716 --> 02:23:20.518]  I don't want to start any arguments over what scripture says.
[02:23:21.159 --> 02:23:25.542]  But then also, in chapter 18, and I forgot what verse this is.
[02:23:25.562 --> 02:23:26.362]  It seems like it's verse 23 or 20.
[02:23:26.402 --> 02:23:26.722]  I think it's 23.
[02:23:29.464 --> 02:24:01.965]   It talks about in the translation how the the spell uh... was was shared with all the nations of the world and and destroyed them and brought a great death through the through the blood and killed off the apostles and all the people of god through the blood well in the original greek that word spell is actually uh... pharmakia so what ben armstrong was explaining to me in an interview that i think is posted on band on video right now he believes that that actually what scripture was predicting
[02:24:02.921 --> 02:24:49.302]   was that Big Pharma and its vaccines and the spike protein would be the quote spell or the sorcery or the pharmakia that kills billions all across the world through their contaminated blood and it's like wow all of a sudden the scripture makes instant sense and you look at the evil behind this and how all the clues now line up and then just today we're going to play this clip when we come back by the way in the next segment Just today, a member of European Parliament has announced just a bombshell that's rocking the world right now, where Pfizer, under questioning at the European Parliament, a Pfizer spokesperson admits that Pfizer never tested their vaccine against a transmission.
[02:24:50.063 --> 02:25:10.431]  So the vaccine, there's no science whatsoever to support the idea that this can halt transmission, or to support the vaccine mandates that say that if people are vaccinated then they won't contribute to the spread of COVID, or that everybody needs to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity, or that everybody at work needs to be vaccinated, everybody in the military needs to be vaccinated.
[02:25:10.451 --> 02:25:12.332]  There's no science behind it at all.
[02:25:12.652 --> 02:25:17.914]   It was a complete fraud, totally made up, We're going to watch that clip after this coming break.
[02:25:17.994 --> 02:25:19.275]  It's just mind-blowing.
[02:25:19.795 --> 02:25:35.263]  But yes, the pharmakia is destroying the world, or I should say it's one of the many vectors that is achieving mass depopulation right now, and apparently that has been foretold in Chapter 18 of the Book of Revelation.
[02:25:35.283 --> 02:25:39.165]  Of course, I'm not the Bible scholar here, just passing this along to you.
[02:25:39.485 --> 02:25:52.003]   People may disagree with interpretations, that's fine, but at least open your eyes and take a look at this because You know, God knows everything, and He knew it long before it all happened, so we know what's going down.
[02:25:52.423 --> 02:26:04.671]  And also, by the way, Ben Armstrong believes that we have not yet entered the Tribulation, which means we've got seven years of hell on earth yet to come, on top of everything we're experiencing right now.
[02:26:04.811 --> 02:26:08.894]  So, folks, get prepared, because it's going to get worse before it gets better.
[02:26:09.935 --> 02:26:11.919]  That's kind of where we are right now in reality.
[02:26:12.420 --> 02:26:13.001]  I'm Mike Adams.
[02:26:13.021 --> 02:26:15.785]  We'll be right back after this break with that video clip and much more.
[02:26:15.846 --> 02:26:17.448]  Stay with us here on InfoWars.com.
[02:26:18.615 --> 02:26:22.278]  All right, we're about to go to a bombshell video clip that just emerged today.
[02:26:22.298 --> 02:26:26.481]  I want to give a shout out to Citizen Free Press for finding this and posting this.
[02:26:26.561 --> 02:26:28.062]  It's been going viral.
[02:26:28.082 --> 02:26:39.751]  A European Parliament member has, well, was asking a Pfizer representative as part of this testimony whether the Pfizer vaccine for COVID had ever been tested versus transmission.
[02:26:40.171 --> 02:26:42.773]  In other words, does it stop the transmission of this virus?
[02:26:42.793 --> 02:26:43.954]  Does it stop person to person?
[02:26:44.714 --> 02:26:48.776]  Uh, catching of this virus and, and well, the answer was no.
[02:26:48.916 --> 02:26:57.201]  So in other words, uh, all this so-called science and follow the science and I believe in science and all this stuff turns out to be nothing but total hogwash.
[02:26:57.821 --> 02:27:03.084]  And frankly, every mainstream media outlet in the world needs to publish a retraction.
[02:27:03.644 --> 02:27:13.290]  If they ever said that this vaccine was proven safe or effective because, uh, it wasn't, let's go to that two minute clip right now and check out this, uh, just, just fascinating testimony.
[02:27:13.310 --> 02:27:13.810]  Let's go to that.
[02:27:14.895 --> 02:27:17.938]  If you don't get vaccinated, you're anti-social.
[02:27:18.518 --> 02:27:21.761]  This is what the Dutch Prime Minister and Health Minister told us.
[02:27:22.582 --> 02:27:26.245]  You don't get vaccinated just for yourself, but also for others.
[02:27:26.966 --> 02:27:28.787]  You do it for all of society.
[02:27:29.388 --> 02:27:30.068]  That's what I said.
[02:27:30.909 --> 02:27:33.531]  Today, this turned out to be complete nonsense.
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:46.588]  In a COVID hearing in the European Parliament, one of the Pfizer directors just admitted to me, at the time of introduction, the vaccine had never been tested on stopping the transmission of the virus.
[02:27:47.685 --> 02:27:51.426]  This removes the entire legal basis for the COVID passport.
[02:27:51.866 --> 02:27:59.329]  The COVID passport that led to massive institutional discrimination as people lost access to essential parts of society.
[02:28:00.189 --> 02:28:02.570]  I find this to be shocking, even criminal.
[02:28:03.270 --> 02:28:05.231]  Please watch the video until the end.
[02:28:06.751 --> 02:28:11.053]  For you, Mrs. Small, I have the following question, which I want a clear answer to.
[02:28:11.353 --> 02:28:14.614]  And I will speak in English, so there are no misunderstandings.
[02:28:16.124 --> 02:28:25.848]  Was the Pfizer COVID vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market?
[02:28:27.588 --> 02:28:29.929]  If not, please say it clearly.
[02:28:30.249 --> 02:28:34.011]  If yes, are you willing to share the data with this committee?
[02:28:34.831 --> 02:28:38.993]  And I really want a straight answer, yes or no, and I'm looking forward to it.
[02:28:39.133 --> 02:28:39.733]  Thank you very much.
[02:28:41.225 --> 02:28:47.710]  Regarding the question around, did we know about stopping the immunization before it's entered the market?
[02:28:49.952 --> 02:28:50.112]  No!
[02:28:50.252 --> 02:28:55.376]  We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market.
[02:28:56.277 --> 02:28:57.398]  This is scandalous.
[02:28:57.958 --> 02:29:19.575]   Millions of people worldwide felt forced to get vaccinated because of the myth I love how she was saying, essentially, we didn't have time to do the science because we had to move at the speed of science.
[02:29:20.075 --> 02:29:22.477]  It's like, wow, you're just fraudsters.
[02:29:22.817 --> 02:29:25.179]  You're just making it all up and claiming it's science.
[02:29:25.539 --> 02:29:30.663]  What does that mean, we had to move at the speed of science, but in order to do so, we had to skip the science?
[02:29:30.743 --> 02:29:31.344]  I mean, come on.
[02:29:32.364 --> 02:29:33.485]  It's a clown world, folks.
[02:29:33.525 --> 02:29:35.507]  I mean, this is idiocracy on steroids.
[02:29:35.927 --> 02:29:43.992]  But, of course, you and I, we've known this the whole time, but now it's coming out more and more in, you know, mainstream conversations here.
[02:29:44.412 --> 02:29:47.695]  So I really want to congratulate that member of the EU Parliament.
[02:29:47.715 --> 02:29:52.878]  I don't know his name, but obviously he's got the courage to ask these questions and help bring this out.
[02:29:53.398 --> 02:30:01.324]  And you may have noticed that, well, the vaccine manufacturers are refusing to release the underlying data that they claim shows the vaccine even worked.
[02:30:01.984 --> 02:30:06.546]  So, the whole idea of, quote, peer-reviewed science is just being thrown out the window here.
[02:30:06.966 --> 02:30:10.828]  There's no peer review allowed because they say, well, the data, it's a secret.
[02:30:11.068 --> 02:30:12.889]  It's all secret data, super secret.
[02:30:13.329 --> 02:30:14.429]  No one's allowed to see it.
[02:30:15.130 --> 02:30:19.951]  Every time these organizations say that, it turns out to be total fraud, by the way.
[02:30:20.252 --> 02:30:28.095]  So now they're just playing a delay game, trying to prevent the data from being revealed, because when the data do come out, guess what?
[02:30:28.695 --> 02:30:32.117]  It's going to show the whole thing was a complete fraud from day one.
[02:30:32.717 --> 02:30:36.499]  And I did a recent interview, by the way, with Karen Kingston that was just bombshell.
[02:30:36.519 --> 02:30:39.921]  That's also posted on Band.Video, by the way, if you want to check it out there.
[02:30:39.941 --> 02:30:41.401]  That was just a few days ago.
[02:30:42.182 --> 02:30:48.505]  And she shows that actually this entire vaccination effort was not about immunization at all.
[02:30:48.885 --> 02:30:50.506]  It was about installation.
[02:30:51.106 --> 02:30:53.908]  You were being installed with an operating system.
[02:30:54.668 --> 02:31:03.352]  You are being installed with some kind of exotic technology that has some other nefarious purpose far beyond immunization, because immunization didn't even work.
[02:31:03.892 --> 02:31:10.335]  Even, as you just saw, Pfizer just admitted they didn't even test to see if it stopped transmission, or if it worked for immunization.
[02:31:10.355 --> 02:31:15.658]  This is a complete, complete fraud that they pushed, of course, but you've known that this entire time.
[02:31:16.809 --> 02:31:17.109]  All right.
[02:31:17.730 --> 02:31:28.636]  We've got more troops pouring into Belarus today from Russia, and Russia launching another wave of missiles, maybe 12 hours ago or less, hitting targets all across Ukraine.
[02:31:29.016 --> 02:31:32.618]  So I want to point out another mass media lie in all of this.
[02:31:33.019 --> 02:31:45.246]  In March or April of this year, we were told that Russia had run out of missiles, and that's why they had to resort to their hypersonic missiles, like the Dagger, I think it's called, the Kinzhal, or some similar word to that.
[02:31:46.215 --> 02:31:54.238]  And so that lie turned out to be, of course, complete nonsense, because it turns out Putin was just restraining the use of missiles.
[02:31:54.358 --> 02:32:10.023]  He actually has plenty of missiles, and he's just done two days in a row of many dozens of missile strikes hitting targets across Ukraine, and taking out, in some cases, some electrical infrastructure capabilities and so on, which the West is now condemning.
[02:32:10.563 --> 02:32:14.365]  Oh, how dare Putin attack infrastructure that affects civilians?
[02:32:14.705 --> 02:32:20.732]   And I'm thinking, Do any of these neocons and leftists, do they even remember Desert Storm?
[02:32:20.953 --> 02:32:22.896]  Do they remember Iraq and the Middle East?
[02:32:23.416 --> 02:32:24.178]  And how the U.S.
[02:32:24.278 --> 02:32:29.305]  carpet bombed the water system, the power system, the roads, the bridges, everything?
[02:32:30.072 --> 02:32:34.772]   And then they all jump on Trump and say, "Yeah, you shouldn't build walls, you should build bridges."
[02:32:34.772 --> 02:32:38.671]   Except now, the left says they should blow up all the bridges, apparently.
[02:32:38.671 --> 02:32:40.872]  You know, if they're in Crimea, for example.
[02:32:40.872 --> 02:32:42.472]  So it's completely insane.
[02:32:42.472 --> 02:32:46.572]   And this is why I really want to give a thumbs up to Tulsi Gabbard today,
[02:32:46.572 --> 02:32:50.271]   who, you know, left the Democrat Party and issued quite a dramatic statement.
[02:32:50.271 --> 02:32:52.572]  I'm sure Infowars covered that earlier.
[02:32:52.572 --> 02:32:58.472]  But Tulsi Gabbard gets my vote as a person with principles.
[02:32:58.472 --> 02:33:04.172]   And frankly, I don't even care if someone agrees with me on every single point.
[02:33:04.172 --> 02:33:09.672]   I just, I want to deal with people who have principles and are consistent in their principles.
[02:33:09.672 --> 02:33:12.471]  And Tulsi Gabbard, even though...
[02:33:12.499 --> 02:33:34.978]  She was a Democrat, and maybe you don't like everything that she's ever said, of course, but she is a woman with principles, and she sticks to those principles, and she is now proving that, and I think she has a very strong political future in any party, or maybe above all the parties, frankly, because she can bridge both parties, and she has my support if she wants to run for office.
[02:33:34.998 --> 02:33:38.161]  I also want to mention Carrie Lake out of Arizona.
[02:33:38.181 --> 02:33:43.466]   Speaking of remarkable women in politics, Carrie Lake is just a breath of fresh air here.
[02:33:43.847 --> 02:33:44.828]  She is just amazing.
[02:33:44.848 --> 02:33:46.670]  I think she's going to win Arizona.
[02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:50.574]  All of you, of course, need to vote for her and support her in her campaign.
[02:33:51.135 --> 02:33:54.438]  And she just takes it to all the haters and the trolls.
[02:33:54.498 --> 02:34:01.064]   And Carrie Lake is just setting an example of what I wish GOP men would act like.
[02:34:01.364 --> 02:34:01.624]  Hey!
[02:34:01.884 --> 02:34:03.405]  Hey, you GOP sissy men!
[02:34:03.845 --> 02:34:11.388]  Why don't you cowboy up and act at least as manly as Carrie Lake, a woman who is out manning you?
[02:34:12.008 --> 02:34:12.828]  I mean, seriously!
[02:34:13.289 --> 02:34:15.750]  And by the way, I don't care if Carrie Lake is a woman or a man.
[02:34:15.890 --> 02:34:17.430]  Gender doesn't mean anything.
[02:34:17.850 --> 02:34:21.512]  I'm, again, looking for people with principles, backbone, and courage.
[02:34:22.112 --> 02:34:24.253]  And that's Tulsi Gabbard, and that's Carrie Lake.
[02:34:24.633 --> 02:34:29.796]   And I wouldn't be surprised if that becomes a ticket For the White House down the road, you know, Carey Lake and Tulsi Gabbard.
[02:34:29.816 --> 02:34:31.057]  I wouldn't be surprised at all.
[02:34:31.137 --> 02:34:32.898]  Or DeSantis and Carey Lake.
[02:34:32.938 --> 02:34:34.399]  Or DeSantis and Tulsi Gabbard.
[02:34:34.499 --> 02:34:35.660]  I wouldn't be surprised at all.
[02:34:36.781 --> 02:34:40.664]  Anything can happen, but if we choose people with principles, we'll all be better off.
[02:34:41.044 --> 02:34:41.424]  Stay with us.
[02:34:41.444 --> 02:34:44.746]  We'll be right back with a special guest and a new interview right after this break.
[02:34:44.786 --> 02:34:46.528]  I'm Mike Adams here on InfoWars.com.
[02:34:48.234 --> 02:34:53.862]  All right, welcome back and continuing now, we're going to be joined by a special guest named John Wadsworth.
[02:34:53.922 --> 02:35:00.111]  He's going to be joining us here for, well, a conversation about the spiritual revolution and the spiritual battle for America.
[02:35:00.131 --> 02:35:05.158]  Now, you know, I'm the founder of Brighteon.com and I'm always looking for people who get it.
[02:35:05.778 --> 02:35:09.563]  People who understand what's going on, and I found John Wadsworth posting there.
[02:35:10.244 --> 02:35:14.829]  His channel's called New Patriot, and I'm encouraging him to branch out to other platforms as well.
[02:35:15.330 --> 02:35:16.531]  And he just nails it.
[02:35:16.571 --> 02:35:19.274]  Lives in California, is joining us now from California.
[02:35:19.334 --> 02:35:21.757]  Mr. Wadsworth, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:21.797 --> 02:35:22.658]  It's great to have you on.
[02:35:22.678 --> 02:35:24.681]  Hi, Mike.
[02:35:24.721 --> 02:35:25.482]  Thanks for having me.
[02:35:26.724 --> 02:35:27.644]  Well, absolutely.
[02:35:27.965 --> 02:35:29.265]  Look, I'm a fan of your work.
[02:35:29.305 --> 02:35:36.328]  I've been watching many of your videos and the reason I invited you on is because, you know, you're a down-to-earth guy and you totally get it.
[02:35:36.488 --> 02:35:37.988]  Let's start with some basics.
[02:35:39.149 --> 02:35:47.472]  Tell us where you think we stand right now in the world in terms of conflict and war and crisis and, you know, lies versus truth.
[02:35:47.512 --> 02:35:49.353]  Just kind of a big-picture overview, if you would, please.
[02:35:51.387 --> 02:35:58.546]  Okay, I think we're in World War III, for starters here, so I think people need to really acknowledge that.
[02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:06.384]  Most of the people in this country are, I think, brainwashed and conditioned, and they're not aware of the danger that we're in.
[02:36:06.844 --> 02:36:12.768]  But even, of course, beyond the physical danger of being in World War III, is the spiritual danger.
[02:36:12.788 --> 02:36:16.350]  We have, as a nation, gone way off the rails.
[02:36:17.130 --> 02:36:19.091]  And so, yeah, we're in it.
[02:36:19.532 --> 02:36:21.353]  We're in World War III.
[02:36:21.373 --> 02:36:25.215]  And America is headed for a great downsizing, I'm afraid.
[02:36:26.314 --> 02:36:27.655]  Well, I want to ask you about that.
[02:36:27.695 --> 02:36:29.716]  Now, you're based in California, correct?
[02:36:29.756 --> 02:36:31.257]  Is that where you're joining us from today?
[02:36:32.478 --> 02:36:34.039]  Yes, from rural California.
[02:36:34.059 --> 02:36:35.681]  We call it New California State out here.
[02:36:35.701 --> 02:36:43.906]  We're actually forming a new state and not submitting any longer to the tyranny and the dictatorship that's just off the hook here.
[02:36:43.986 --> 02:36:48.910]  So, for us, that's also an expression of repentance and turning back to God.
[02:36:51.417 --> 02:36:53.017]  So yeah, tell us about that briefly.
[02:36:53.057 --> 02:36:58.518]  I know there's been quite an effort underway and there are models such as Virginia and West Virginia throughout history.
[02:36:58.539 --> 02:37:03.660]  And of course, Paul Preston, I'm scheduled to interview him at some point here shortly.
[02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:07.760]  Is that the same movement that you're part of, the one that he's involved in?
[02:37:09.121 --> 02:37:09.641]  Yes, it is.
[02:37:09.781 --> 02:37:16.682]  Yeah, we are following the model of West Virginia, which is a well-established model of creating a state from an existing state.
[02:37:16.782 --> 02:37:17.843]  So that's our path here.
[02:37:21.454 --> 02:37:23.955]  And do you think that that's going to succeed?
[02:37:23.995 --> 02:37:29.176]  I mean, wasn't there a ballot initiative or something that you were gathering signatures for?
[02:37:29.196 --> 02:37:30.156]  I forgot the details.
[02:37:30.196 --> 02:37:30.836]  Phil Asen, please.
[02:37:32.577 --> 02:37:33.957]  I don't remember any ballot.
[02:37:33.997 --> 02:37:35.497]  We have not had a ballot initiative.
[02:37:35.538 --> 02:37:40.379]  There have been other new state attempts, but we're not following that process.
[02:37:40.539 --> 02:37:41.739]  We're following a different process.
[02:37:41.759 --> 02:37:58.294]   Paul will tell you more about that when you interview him, but we're following the The Constitutional approach, and it's a section of the Constitution called the Admissions Clause, or the New States Clause, so that's, and it doesn't have anything to do with the Ballot Initiative, by the way, so it's interesting, but that's what we're doing.
[02:37:59.355 --> 02:38:07.297]  Are you, just last question on that, and we'll move on, but are you confident that you'll be able to achieve that success as a new state, and what would the new state be called, by the way?
[02:38:08.823 --> 02:38:10.725]  The new state would be called New California.
[02:38:11.426 --> 02:38:16.251]  And as West Virginia, by the way, was called New Virginia before it was called West Virginia.
[02:38:16.712 --> 02:38:18.974]  And for us, failure is not an option.
[02:38:19.094 --> 02:38:21.977]  So a lot of us are just saying we're not moving out of California.
[02:38:23.659 --> 02:38:25.721]  Our elections have been stolen here for decades.
[02:38:25.961 --> 02:38:26.882]  We're kind of used to it.
[02:38:27.803 --> 02:38:29.566]  And we're talking about rural California.
[02:38:29.666 --> 02:38:31.608]  So we've actually formed a government.
[02:38:31.668 --> 02:38:34.211]  We have senators and assembly people in every county.
[02:38:34.812 --> 02:38:35.874]  We have a strong presence.
[02:38:35.914 --> 02:38:37.996]  We've had a number of different constitutional conventions.
[02:38:38.697 --> 02:38:44.024]  And we're actually legislating right now and ready to govern with the restored government of California.
[02:38:47.540 --> 02:38:48.240]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:38:48.340 --> 02:38:48.700]  And I will.
[02:38:48.961 --> 02:38:59.084]  But the whole COVID fiasco, the forced lockdowns, you know, the masking, the children yanked out of schools, the vaccine mandates, especially even for city workers and so on.
[02:38:59.584 --> 02:39:04.866]  Did that accelerate, I'm wondering, the people embracing the idea of forming a new state?
[02:39:06.367 --> 02:39:07.807]  Oh, I think that's a catalyst.
[02:39:08.127 --> 02:39:09.228]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:39:09.248 --> 02:39:09.968]  That's a catalyst.
[02:39:10.583 --> 02:39:13.666]  So that is a gift to us, so yeah.
[02:39:14.127 --> 02:39:20.874]  And when they try it again, which I'm sure they will, we basically, the New California Patriots, we never submitted to it.
[02:39:21.054 --> 02:39:29.223]  So many were, some became fugitives, some became persecuted, some lost their jobs, some fled the state, and some are coming back.
[02:39:29.964 --> 02:39:31.546]  So yeah, that is a catalyst.
[02:39:32.794 --> 02:39:37.478]  Well, I have a great idea for the entire new California economy.
[02:39:38.580 --> 02:39:50.731]  All you have to do is manufacture all the things that California is banning, such as natural gas powered water heaters, full flush toilets, and of course combustion engine cars.
[02:39:50.771 --> 02:39:54.154]  The new California state just buys used cars from all over America.
[02:39:54.614 --> 02:39:54.814]  I agree.
[02:39:54.634 --> 02:39:59.373]   fix up the used cars, sell them to the West Coast California people as used vehicles with
[02:39:59.373 --> 02:40:02.713]   combustion engines because the electric cars aren't going to be available.
[02:40:02.713 --> 02:40:05.634]  I mean, there's not enough lithium in the world.
[02:40:05.634 --> 02:40:08.953]  I tell you, the new California will have a booming economy.
[02:40:08.953 --> 02:40:11.113]  Yes, it will.
[02:40:11.113 --> 02:40:12.873]  We're looking forward to that.
[02:40:12.873 --> 02:40:13.873]  Yeah.
[02:40:13.873 --> 02:40:14.873]  Okay.
[02:40:15.107 --> 02:40:16.548]  So let's broaden our scope now.
[02:40:16.568 --> 02:40:25.755]  Let's talk about all of America, because you have a really powerful message about the spiritual revolution that is underway and the spiritual battle that is upon us.
[02:40:26.035 --> 02:40:26.716]  Let me ask you this.
[02:40:28.617 --> 02:40:40.146]  How important is it that we bring God into our lives to help defeat the evil, the tyrants, because they seem to be all infested with demons and Luciferian tendencies.
[02:40:40.526 --> 02:40:42.308]  How important is this aspect of the battle?
[02:40:44.053 --> 02:40:45.114]  Oh, it's absolutely critical.
[02:40:45.454 --> 02:40:46.895]  Without God, the nation falls.
[02:40:47.515 --> 02:40:51.618]  In fact, I think we're to the point where, no matter what, I think we get downsized.
[02:40:51.898 --> 02:40:52.859]  Severely downsized.
[02:40:53.339 --> 02:40:57.482]  Judgment is coming, and as I've been saying, the axe is laid at the root.
[02:40:57.942 --> 02:41:03.706]  There are just some aspects of society, even some geographical areas, that just, they're not going to make it.
[02:41:04.186 --> 02:41:05.387]  They're just not going to make it.
[02:41:05.487 --> 02:41:10.561]   And so, faith in God, and I actually, I'm a Christian.
[02:41:10.821 --> 02:41:16.165]  I believe the Bible is God's Word, and I guess I consider myself a paleo-eclectic Christian.
[02:41:16.205 --> 02:41:27.974]  So, you know, I go to a non-denominational church, but it's all about, for us, believing God and His Word, and establishing a society that that is the foundation that it's built on.
[02:41:28.074 --> 02:41:28.814]  So it's critical.
[02:41:30.576 --> 02:41:39.593]   Every nation that rejects God gets judged, and I think We've just gone way too far in the wrong direction.
[02:41:40.173 --> 02:41:45.834]  We have embraced many of the things that other cultures in history have embraced that led to their downfall.
[02:41:46.434 --> 02:41:47.375]  Pick your empire, right?
[02:41:47.415 --> 02:41:57.137]  I mean, this culture, this country now has institutionalized child sacrifice, and we have spirit cookers, pedophiles, groomers.
[02:41:58.938 --> 02:42:03.839]  All this stuff is being institutionalized as a sort of state religion.
[02:42:04.526 --> 02:42:10.613]  So, I approach it from this perspective, Mike, is that anthropologically, that would be scientifically speaking, right?
[02:42:10.673 --> 02:42:15.519]  Anthropology proves, it's an anthropological fact that man is a religious creature.
[02:42:15.559 --> 02:42:20.405]  So the question isn't, are we going to have Christianity or faith in God?
[02:42:20.485 --> 02:42:24.598]   The question is going to be, what is What is your God going to be?
[02:42:24.618 --> 02:42:26.279]  Is it going to be pedophilia?
[02:42:26.619 --> 02:42:27.819]  Is it going to be statism?
[02:42:28.339 --> 02:42:31.620]  Is it going to be LGBTQ nonsense?
[02:42:32.081 --> 02:42:33.021]  Is it going to be Marxism?
[02:42:33.101 --> 02:42:33.581]  Leninism?
[02:42:34.101 --> 02:42:49.606]  And this country has embraced false gods and so what I'm about is returning to just the simple faith in God expressed in the Bible and following his wise plan and his simple instructions.
[02:42:50.922 --> 02:43:02.055]  Yeah, and you know, I'm glad you mentioned anthropology, too, because the whole history of anthropology proves there's no such thing as men who can get pregnant, because you don't find transgender fossils, by the way.
[02:43:02.475 --> 02:43:07.801]  There are no transgender chimpanzees and apes and primates and orangutans and all that, no.
[02:43:08.642 --> 02:43:09.862]  It's males and females, folks.
[02:43:09.922 --> 02:43:10.603]  That's it.
[02:43:10.743 --> 02:43:11.483]  That's all there is.
[02:43:11.823 --> 02:43:12.943]  Everything else is delusion.
[02:43:13.363 --> 02:43:15.344]  So, yeah, we have to get back to that.
[02:43:15.364 --> 02:43:16.904]  We've got to stop the child mutilations.
[02:43:18.245 --> 02:43:21.825]  Exactly as you said, God judges the nation, and you mentioned, I think, depopulation.
[02:43:21.885 --> 02:43:23.386]  How bad do you think that's going to get, John?
[02:43:25.186 --> 02:43:56.173]   I think it's going to get very bad, and I think it's going to affect the urbanized areas, which are typically your blue areas, way more Severely than it is the areas of the country that are say more self-reliant and that would be the rural areas so the closer people seem to be to nature and basic things like just knowing where food comes from right there more connected with reality and They will fare much better, but even in those areas.
[02:43:56.433 --> 02:44:08.679]   It's people are headed for a rude awakening probably this winter and And of course, if people continue taking these non-vaccine vaccines, which of course is, you know... Sorry to interrupt.
[02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:09.982]  We're going to go to a break, John.
[02:44:10.002 --> 02:44:13.969]  We'll be right back, folks, with more with John Wadsworth here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:14.009 --> 02:44:14.610]  I'm Mike Adams.
[02:44:14.670 --> 02:44:15.111]  Stay with us.
[02:44:16.556 --> 02:44:24.264]  I'm going to answer a health question for you real quickly here about iodine, then we're going to continue with our interview with John Wadsworth about the spiritual war in America.
[02:44:25.024 --> 02:44:33.573]  Some people have asked me, what's the difference between potassium iodide and iodine, such as what the InfoWars store sells, like the X3 product?
[02:44:34.153 --> 02:44:38.418]  Folks, the potassium that is in potassium iodide is pointless.
[02:44:38.458 --> 02:44:40.821]  The potassium doesn't offer any special protection.
[02:44:40.861 --> 02:44:52.974]  It's just a stable, solid form that is easy to take, but the potassium dissociates very quickly in your stomach acid, and you just get extra potassium that's basically inconsequential.
[02:44:53.114 --> 02:44:54.075]  The key is the iodine.
[02:44:54.896 --> 02:45:03.178]  And the X3 form of iodine does the exact same job and perhaps even better in terms of absorption compared to potassium iodide.
[02:45:03.559 --> 02:45:11.781]  The only difference is that I think the FDA has approved certain brand names of potassium iodide for nuclear events.
[02:45:12.401 --> 02:45:15.962]  But frankly, all forms of iodine have a similar effect.
[02:45:15.982 --> 02:45:20.662]  It's just a question of what form you prefer to take it in and what you can get.
[02:45:20.702 --> 02:45:27.464]  So frankly, support InfoWars, you know, and get the liquid form, the X3, high absorbability, and it does the trick.
[02:45:27.984 --> 02:45:32.284]  And in my view, it probably gets absorbed more quickly than potassium iodide.
[02:45:32.705 --> 02:45:34.085]  So I think it's a superior form.
[02:45:34.105 --> 02:45:38.686]  But that's just my opinion as a, you know, a food scientist and a health expert.
[02:45:39.066 --> 02:45:40.646]  You know, take it for what you will.
[02:45:41.474 --> 02:45:43.576]  All right, getting back to John Wadsworth here.
[02:45:44.016 --> 02:45:49.700]  By the way, the government of Finland is now telling its own citizens to start taking iodine.
[02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:55.224]  So not only are we getting warnings from across the world, from other countries, but now Finland as well.
[02:45:55.864 --> 02:45:59.047]  And if you're smart, you're going to be doing this in the United States.
[02:45:59.507 --> 02:46:01.469]  Now, John, thank you again for joining me.
[02:46:01.509 --> 02:46:06.632]  John's channel on Brighteon.com is called New Patriot, and he's great.
[02:46:06.692 --> 02:46:08.053]  I've watched a lot of his videos.
[02:46:08.073 --> 02:46:09.334]  I'm a fan of his work.
[02:46:10.535 --> 02:46:16.721]  You talked previously about God judging the United States, kind of like Sodom and Gomorrah.
[02:46:17.302 --> 02:46:21.186]  That judgment, do you think it has already begun, or is it yet to come?
[02:46:21.286 --> 02:46:22.047]  What will it look like?
[02:46:23.468 --> 02:46:28.814]  I think it has begun, and it's manifesting in different degrees, but things are coming to a climax.
[02:46:31.522 --> 02:46:33.044]  God has different means of judging.
[02:46:33.064 --> 02:46:40.393]  Sore, and famine, and pestilence, and disease are all common things that you see throughout the biblical history.
[02:46:41.074 --> 02:46:44.137]  And God's no respecter of persons, and in America is no different.
[02:46:44.598 --> 02:46:47.622]  If we turn our backs on Him, we can expect the same thing to happen.
[02:46:47.962 --> 02:46:49.163]  It's a cause and effect, Mike.
[02:46:50.729 --> 02:46:52.830]  So, we're just people.
[02:46:52.850 --> 02:47:01.673]  We're human beings, and if we do the same things that previous civilizations have done, and the difference, I guess, with us is that we've had more light than other countries.
[02:47:02.193 --> 02:47:03.033]  More revelation.
[02:47:03.514 --> 02:47:06.134]  More revelation, really, even than the nation of Israel.
[02:47:06.154 --> 02:47:09.195]  I mean, we have the Jewish people to thank for our Bible, but...
[02:47:12.057 --> 02:47:15.558]  This nation was founded like no other and we have to turn back to our roots.
[02:47:16.018 --> 02:47:23.801]  And Mike, I think that as the judgment manifests, I think war is actually a big, it's a major, major part of that.
[02:47:23.841 --> 02:47:25.081]  I think, I really do think it is.
[02:47:25.842 --> 02:47:28.903]  And even during the war between the states, in America, the Civil War.
[02:47:30.635 --> 02:47:35.078]  People widely recognized back then that that was God's judgment.
[02:47:35.518 --> 02:47:41.942]  It wasn't such an outlandish thought, but I think today many people, it's hard to process because they don't have a framework.
[02:47:42.697 --> 02:47:43.838]  Because they don't read the whole Bible.
[02:47:43.858 --> 02:47:47.360]  If they do read the Bible, maybe it's like a CliffsNotes version, you know?
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:48:00.169]  But the thing is today about contemporary Christianity is we've scaled down the truths that are contained in God's Word to just sort of, you know, we keep the Christian life in the ecclesiastical world.
[02:48:00.709 --> 02:48:03.051]  But we don't let it touch politics or food or health.
[02:48:03.712 --> 02:48:06.973]  Or science, or, you know, other things.
[02:48:07.073 --> 02:48:15.735]  But in Christianity, in the first century, the Christianity that rocks the world was a Christianity, before they called it Christianity, they called it the Way.
[02:48:16.096 --> 02:48:19.056]  And it was the way of following Jesus Christ, the way of following God.
[02:48:19.496 --> 02:48:28.158]   And Mike, I think that we're going to, people will emerge from this This time of judgment, this would be called a remnant people.
[02:48:28.198 --> 02:48:32.843]  The people that actually emerge out of this will be, God calls them remnant people.
[02:48:33.303 --> 02:48:37.547]  And that is, that's who you speak to when you're, you know, in your messages.
[02:48:37.627 --> 02:48:38.888]  These are people that will survive.
[02:48:39.548 --> 02:48:42.211]  And I think it's going to be incumbent upon us.
[02:48:42.931 --> 02:48:47.656]  Well, being able to identify then, the discernment, has never been easier.
[02:48:48.157 --> 02:49:00.129]  Because, you know, it used to be for a while, some people who maybe, they didn't believe in God, or they were atheists, but they used to be, many of them, still sort of polite members of a polite society, and they would get along, and you know.
[02:49:00.709 --> 02:49:03.031]  But now, they're just demons!
[02:49:03.051 --> 02:49:04.011]  They're like goblins!
[02:49:04.051 --> 02:49:05.913]  Like child-mutilating goblins!
[02:49:06.493 --> 02:49:16.920]  And they celebrate it, and they love it, and they even have all this out-picturing and so on, just showing the demonism all over their faces and with their hair and body alterations and everything.
[02:49:17.340 --> 02:49:22.944]  And they even sound like demons as they're bragging about how they're exploiting and mutilating children.
[02:49:23.684 --> 02:49:27.407]  So, it's never been easier to tell the difference, would you agree?
[02:49:28.815 --> 02:49:29.897]  I totally agree with that.
[02:49:29.957 --> 02:49:31.179]  It's manifesting everywhere.
[02:49:31.199 --> 02:49:34.485]  And, you know, I could point something out too, Mike.
[02:49:34.525 --> 02:49:56.555]   We were talking about this yesterday, is that the famous Soviet defector, Yuri Bezmenov, Revealed the strategy of taking down America, and it was a communist subversion plot that involved first demoralization, and that means removing the morals from a society, making it completely moral-less.
[02:49:56.575 --> 02:50:07.303]  And this is what we've done, you know, Vladimir Putin actually pointed it out, is that we have a country now where those who worship Satan are on equal footing with those who worship God.
[02:50:07.992 --> 02:50:16.574]  You know, and then the other two main steps that Yuri Bezmenov talked about prior to that, he says these things would occur prior to the takedown of America.
[02:50:17.055 --> 02:50:20.796]  One was there would be a crisis and he said this could be brought about in a matter of weeks.
[02:50:20.856 --> 02:50:32.339]  I think he said and then normalization that going through this crisis everything would be normalized and but see all this happens the backdrop for all of this is a society without morals.
[02:50:34.943 --> 02:50:44.612]  So when you say demoralization, you're talking about the removal of morals from society, not kind of like battlefield morale where people have courage.
[02:50:44.852 --> 02:50:46.614]  You're talking about eliminating morals.
[02:50:46.814 --> 02:50:49.477]  I think that interpretation is exactly correct.
[02:50:50.498 --> 02:50:50.778]  Go ahead.
[02:50:52.074 --> 02:50:54.016]  Yeah, no, I think that is it, you know.
[02:50:54.416 --> 02:50:59.821]  When he said that, I first thought he meant like discouraging society, but demoralization of society.
[02:50:59.841 --> 02:51:04.465]  Remember, his mother tongue was Russian, and I think it means removing.
[02:51:04.585 --> 02:51:07.388]  It's an amoral society, and that is really what we've become.
[02:51:07.748 --> 02:51:32.701]   At any time in this culture, when you express an opinion that's rooted in moral truth, timeless moral principles, or eternal principles, people will look at you As if, well that's just your opinion, and you know, as if an opposite opinion, which is completely the wrong direction, worshipping Satan for instance, is of equal value or equally true somehow.
[02:51:33.553 --> 02:51:35.895]  That's kind of where we are, Aaron.
[02:51:35.935 --> 02:51:43.842]  No, if you say, yeah, you shouldn't use scalpels to mutilate children and slice off their breasts and genitals, and then leftists will say, well, that's just your view.
[02:51:44.462 --> 02:51:44.763]  No!
[02:51:45.844 --> 02:51:47.145]  That's the correct view!
[02:51:47.525 --> 02:51:51.348]  You don't mutilate children for profit and call it progress.
[02:51:51.569 --> 02:51:52.349]  I mean, come on.
[02:51:53.851 --> 02:51:54.791]  People are out of their minds.
[02:51:56.377 --> 02:52:17.971]  And one of the other things that Yuri Bezmenov predicted, he says when the society gets this far in the process of being ready for a communist takeover, which he was talking about, is that when they're demoralized, when there are no morals left, he said it doesn't matter how many facts you present to people, they simply will not receive them.
[02:52:18.820 --> 02:52:20.143]  And logic won't apply.
[02:52:20.183 --> 02:52:22.507]  They're incapable of processing.
[02:52:22.648 --> 02:52:28.138]  Once demoralization has occurred in a society, they're incapable of recognizing truth.
[02:52:29.059 --> 02:52:50.759]   Well that's exactly where we are and it's funny because this came out in Putin's recent speech talking about how the West has become essentially a satanic or an anti-Christ civilization in his view and he was talking about how Russia feels like they can't negotiate, they can't communicate with the West because the West is run by these lunatics that just I mean, what do you do?
[02:52:50.779 --> 02:52:58.866]  It's kind of like arguing with a leftist about something like, you know, if they claim men can get pregnant, and you're like, that's insane, that's stupid.
[02:52:59.546 --> 02:53:03.409]  Of course men can't get pregnant, but then they will believe it no matter what.
[02:53:03.550 --> 02:53:08.294]  They will defend their insanity because, well, I mean, let's face it.
[02:53:08.894 --> 02:53:12.177]  They're infested with demonic influence at this point.
[02:53:12.197 --> 02:53:15.680]  But, John, we're about to wrap up this segment with you.
[02:53:15.920 --> 02:53:22.046]  What are your final thoughts of what people should do to help save America from this demonic downfall?
[02:53:23.890 --> 02:53:26.794]  Okay, so I think people, first of all, is turn back to God.
[02:53:26.814 --> 02:53:31.259]  And there's not a real formula for that because it's got to be very sincere.
[02:53:31.840 --> 02:53:33.942]  But it starts with prayer and repentance.
[02:53:34.022 --> 02:53:37.046]  Just, God, please forgive me.
[02:53:37.186 --> 02:53:40.630]  Please forgive our nation for our sins and show me what I need to do.
[02:53:41.010 --> 02:53:42.072]  Lord, what should I do?
[02:53:42.856 --> 02:53:44.297]  To be part of the solution here.
[02:53:44.337 --> 02:53:45.118]  It starts with that.
[02:53:45.679 --> 02:53:49.642]  And like I said, God's got a wise plan and he's got simple instructions.
[02:53:50.803 --> 02:53:54.827]  I encourage people to get involved in some sort of a local, you know, fellowship.
[02:53:54.927 --> 02:53:58.730]  And of course, if you're in New California, I just urge you to join what we're doing here.
[02:53:58.750 --> 02:54:00.112]  We want we listen.
[02:54:02.239 --> 02:54:04.563]  Guys, life is still worth defending.
[02:54:05.144 --> 02:54:06.527]  Freedom is still worth defending.
[02:54:07.108 --> 02:54:10.914]  And giving up is unthinkable, but we need to be on God's side.
[02:54:10.935 --> 02:54:12.277]  We don't ask God to be on our side.
[02:54:12.397 --> 02:54:13.539]  We need to be on His side.
[02:54:13.599 --> 02:54:14.922]  I think that's where we start here, Mike.
[02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:16.481]  All right, well said.
[02:54:16.561 --> 02:54:24.486]  John Wadsworth, known as New Patriot, folks, if you want to check out his channel on Brighttown.com, and I'm sure you'll be posting elsewhere as well.
[02:54:24.506 --> 02:54:25.506]  It's great to have you on today.
[02:54:25.546 --> 02:54:28.288]  Thank you for joining me, and thank all of you for watching today.
[02:54:28.348 --> 02:54:32.751]  Visit SaveInfoWars.com to help donate to keep this platform on the air.
[02:54:32.771 --> 02:54:33.951]  I'm Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.
[02:54:34.252 --> 02:54:35.172]  Thank you for watching today.
[02:54:35.031 --> 02:54:45.911]  God bless America.
[02:54:45.922 --> 02:54:49.004]  In fact, I've gone through a lot of attacks, a lot of degradation, to tell the truth.
[02:54:49.844 --> 02:54:51.985]  But I am somebody that doesn't like to beg.
[02:54:52.886 --> 02:54:54.787]  And I'm somebody that doesn't like to bother people.
[02:54:55.927 --> 02:55:10.374]  But you know, if I don't bother you now, if I don't push you now to fight for freedom even harder, we're going to have the globalists, these control freaks, Satanists, and pedophiles ruling our lives and ruling the lives of our children and innocent people.
[02:55:11.499 --> 02:55:21.482]  So I can override my instinct not to beg, and my instinct not to plead, and my instinct not to be annoying, and just tell you, who's deliberate like him for worse?
[02:55:22.183 --> 02:55:25.204]  Who's had an effect against the New World Order as big as we have?
[02:55:25.224 --> 02:55:26.524]  And the answer is nobody.
[02:55:26.544 --> 02:55:30.705]  And it's because we have you, an incredible audience of activists that have done an amazing job.
[02:55:31.246 --> 02:55:32.926]  So, so much of our mission is completed.
[02:55:32.986 --> 02:55:36.028]   I'd say 90% of the work We set out to do.
[02:55:36.088 --> 02:55:41.275]  Exposing the New World Order, preparing folks for their attack, getting people ready to fight back, is now bearing fruit.
[02:55:41.516 --> 02:55:43.098]  We're having incredible successes everywhere.
[02:55:43.378 --> 02:55:49.627]  Nationalists, populists, anti-New World Order folks getting elected, the globalists in full panic mode, their poison shot agenda falling apart.
[02:55:49.647 --> 02:55:50.488]  The list goes on and on.
[02:55:51.400 --> 02:56:01.410]  But now we reach the critical part of the fight where the deep state is targeting all the leadership of the resistance and they see InfoWars as the very tip of the spear they want to blunt.
[02:56:02.091 --> 02:56:05.274]  So I want to ask you all to support InfoWars now more than ever.
[02:56:05.714 --> 02:56:09.678]  Now I've run some fundraisers in the past for legal defense funds for free speech and InfoWars.
[02:56:10.259 --> 02:56:12.121]  And we've got that basically paid for now.
[02:56:12.761 --> 02:56:14.903]  But courts have ruled I've got to pay my legal fees.
[02:56:14.923 --> 02:56:15.584]  I don't have the money.
[02:56:16.204 --> 02:56:17.205]  So I need your support.
[02:56:17.826 --> 02:56:28.194]  Please go to SaveInfoWars.com today and make a donation on GiveSendGo, whether it's $5, $10, or $100, so that I personally continue to battle.
[02:56:28.455 --> 02:56:31.417]  We're so close to victory, but I know this, we're not giving up.
[02:56:31.798 --> 02:56:33.159]  So please help me not give up.
[02:56:33.499 --> 02:56:36.621]  Please take action now at SaveInfoWars.com.
[02:56:36.981 --> 02:56:41.985]  SaveInfoWars.com for the first time ever and donate directly to me so I can stay in the fight.
[02:56:42.105 --> 02:56:42.445]  Thank you.
[02:56:42.685 --> 02:56:45.367]  You've been encouraging your audience to give you money, right?
[02:56:46.768 --> 02:56:47.569]  Yes, like media.
[02:56:47.649 --> 02:56:48.729]  I raise money to stay on air.
[02:56:49.490 --> 02:56:58.196]  And the most recent website you've been encouraging your audience to donate at is 1776Coin.com, right?
[02:56:59.857 --> 02:57:01.638]  Well, it's where you can buy silver coins.
[02:57:03.112 --> 02:57:06.095]  1776coin.com is the website, right?
[02:57:06.515 --> 02:57:06.776]  Yes.
[02:57:07.096 --> 02:57:10.840]  It's the fourth coin that we've released in the last year.
[02:57:11.560 --> 02:57:12.741]  And I believe the most powerful.
[02:57:13.182 --> 02:57:16.245]  The man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[02:57:17.786 --> 02:57:19.188]  Citizen of a republic.
[02:57:20.282 --> 02:57:21.223]  The man in the arena.
[02:57:21.763 --> 02:57:23.804]  There's only 10,000 of this coin.
[02:57:24.144 --> 02:57:25.185]  It exists in the world.
[02:57:25.625 --> 02:57:27.186]  It will never be made again.
[02:57:27.206 --> 02:57:29.828]  It's not just an amazing historic coin.
[02:57:30.248 --> 02:57:33.490]  It funds the information war against the globalists.
[02:57:33.830 --> 02:57:36.011]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren.
[02:57:36.371 --> 02:57:37.592]  This is something you want to own.
[02:57:38.092 --> 02:57:43.315]  And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war against the globalists.
[02:57:43.876 --> 02:57:46.217]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available.
[02:57:46.257 --> 02:57:47.278]  They'll sell out very quickly.
[02:57:47.958 --> 02:57:50.659]  Please be part of history, and thank you all for your support.
[02:57:51.499 --> 02:57:57.821]  You can go to 1776coin.com, or you can go to PatriotCollectibles.com and secure this coin.
[02:57:58.101 --> 02:58:02.503]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence, and it funds the Infowar.
[02:58:03.183 --> 02:58:04.884]  Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[02:58:05.404 --> 02:58:05.724]  1776coin.com.
[02:58:05.784 --> 02:58:07.024]  Anyway, back to this coin.
[02:58:07.184 --> 02:58:11.306]  This is what you've been asking your audience to give you money for this week, right?
[02:58:12.366 --> 02:58:15.027]  We actually started making these coins six months ago.
[02:58:16.087 --> 02:58:24.850]  But what you're running right now, this week, is you've been talking about this trial, after you said that you're sending them to 1776coin.com, right?
[02:58:25.090 --> 02:58:32.472]  Yes, that's where we sell the collectible coins for people that want to keep the show on the air.
[02:58:32.872 --> 02:58:33.532]  Okay.
[02:58:33.672 --> 02:58:37.393]  And did you tell Brittany Paz about that revenue platform?
[02:58:38.814 --> 02:58:39.894]  We advertise it on air, yeah.
