[00:00.000 --> 00:22.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:22.000 --> 00:33.720]  We do have some breaking news.
[00:33.720 --> 00:38.600]  There are satellite images and what they appear to show is rapid construction at several
[00:38.600 --> 00:43.800]  suspected silo fields in China that could eventually launch nuclear weapons.
[00:43.800 --> 00:48.000]  All of this as the country is also significantly bolstering its military capabilities.
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.080]  CNN has learned that the U.S. is developing contingency plans for possible Russian escalation
[00:54.080 --> 00:59.720]  in its war in Ukraine, including the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons.
[00:59.720 --> 01:06.680]  The prospect of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of possibility.
[01:06.680 --> 01:12.360]  U.S. Coast Guard spots Chinese guided missile cruiser and Russian naval ships off the Alaskan
[01:12.360 --> 01:17.400]  coast, a patrol boat found 86 miles off the coast of Alaska.
[01:17.400 --> 01:22.000]  Three Chinese naval ships, including a guided missile cruiser, as well as four Russian naval
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.320]  vessels, including a destroyer, spotted in a single battle formation.
[01:26.320 --> 01:31.360]  I think that Russia and China are working on things behind the scenes, and our leaders
[01:31.360 --> 01:37.760]  are so behind the ball, and our media is so behind that they don't see what's going
[01:37.760 --> 01:38.760]  on.
[01:38.760 --> 01:48.400]  They seem to be deliberately provoking Russia.
[01:48.400 --> 01:52.880]  They all believe that defending Ukraine is worth risking Armageddon.
[01:52.880 --> 02:19.720]  It means the end of the world.
[02:19.720 --> 02:32.440]  The U.S.
[02:32.440 --> 02:42.440]  That's what I'm saying to you.
[03:32.440 --> 03:52.440]  That's what I'm saying to you.
[03:52.440 --> 04:12.440]  That's what I'm saying to you.
[04:12.440 --> 04:38.440]  That's what I'm saying to you.
[04:38.440 --> 04:58.440]  That's what I'm saying to you.
[04:58.440 --> 05:24.440]  That's what I'm saying to you.
[05:24.440 --> 05:52.440]  That's what I'm saying to you.
[05:52.440 --> 06:18.440]  That's what I'm saying to you.
[06:18.440 --> 06:46.440]  That's what I'm saying to you.
[06:46.440 --> 07:14.440]  That's what I'm saying to you.
[07:14.440 --> 07:38.440]  That's what I'm saying to you.
[07:38.440 --> 07:46.440]  Now, I'm calling on my fellow common sense independent-minded Democrats to join me in leaving the Democratic Party.
[07:46.440 --> 07:53.440]  If you can no longer stomach the direction that the so-called woke Democratic Party ideologues are taking our country,
[07:53.440 --> 07:56.440]  and I invite you to join me.
[07:56.440 --> 08:04.440]  The Democratic Party is 100% a weaponized criminal globalist operation against America.
[08:04.440 --> 08:08.440]  Trump and our Liberty Movement got a major beachhead in the controlled neocon Republicans,
[08:08.440 --> 08:11.440]  and we are very close to taking over the Republican Party.
[08:11.440 --> 08:18.440]  That's why the globalists are starting wars, imploding borders, annihilating the economy, because they know they're on the way out.
[08:18.440 --> 08:26.440]  All right, we took a lot of calls yesterday. I thought they were really informative on World War III, on the economy, on the assaults on humanity.
[08:26.440 --> 08:30.440]  We're going to cover a lot of critical news as well today, but I want to give the number out.
[08:30.440 --> 08:35.440]  In fact, I'm going to give the number out at the start of the next segment.
[08:35.440 --> 08:38.440]  We're going to take calls throughout the broadcast.
[08:38.440 --> 08:48.440]  We also have several big guests joining us, like Stephen K. Bannon, Mike Adams, and others in the second and fourth hour today.
[08:48.440 --> 08:53.440]  But Bannon's only over 30 minutes, so we'll take calls this hour, we'll take calls after Bannon leaves,
[08:53.440 --> 08:59.440]  and then we have a whole hour before Mike Adams comes on, one to two, then Michael Always, as usual, knocking out of the park.
[08:59.440 --> 09:07.440]  So big broadcasts lined up today as we attempt and have a lot of success igniting brush fires in the minds of men and women of Liberty.
[09:07.440 --> 09:12.440]  Okay. Wow.
[09:12.440 --> 09:20.440]  You talk about exhausted. I am extremely exhausted. I look exhausted. I am exhausted. I know you're exhausted.
[09:20.440 --> 09:26.440]  But evil is even more tired than we are, and it's being worn out right now, and it's losing on every front.
[09:26.440 --> 09:29.440]  So we've just got to fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
[09:29.440 --> 09:34.440]  Because if we give up now, and if we don't go all in now,
[09:34.440 --> 09:44.440]  if you think things are bad today, woo-hoo, baby, we have not seen the tip of this iceberg yet.
[09:44.440 --> 09:50.440]  So we're going to take your phone calls, first-time callers, long-time callers, people that agree, people that disagree.
[09:50.440 --> 09:57.440]  You've got a serious beef with me all debate you on it. If it's some made-up talking point, I'm not going to sit there and spin my wheels.
[09:57.440 --> 10:01.440]  But I love folks that disagree as well. Try to get an idea of what you're actually thinking.
[10:01.440 --> 10:06.440]  Let me tell you what's on the agenda today in between your phone calls.
[10:06.440 --> 10:11.440]  I have several big stacks that have been building up over the last few days that I haven't hit yet that I do want to hit.
[10:11.440 --> 10:16.440]  And that is the whole transgenderism weaponization coming after our children,
[10:16.440 --> 10:22.440]  shocking footage of men and women that had their testicles and breasts cut off and penises cut off.
[10:22.440 --> 10:29.440]  And now when they say that they were coercive children to sign up for this, they're being censored by the heartable,
[10:29.440 --> 10:36.440]  wicked monsters of big tech that are big pharma that know exactly what they're doing.
[10:36.440 --> 10:44.440]  The same big pharma and big tech that censor the incredible news document on every front that the so-called vaccines are not vaccines
[10:44.440 --> 10:52.440]  and are bio weapons that destroy the blood just to start in their host bodies.
[10:52.440 --> 11:01.440]  FDA will withhold autopsy results of those who died at recovered shots in latest shocker, but we already have the epidemiologists
[11:01.440 --> 11:11.440]  out of Germany and out of the UK and out of Canada, the US and Australia confirming the coroners,
[11:11.440 --> 11:18.440]  the pathologists, the virologists, all of them coming out and documenting that it is the shots that are killing people,
[11:18.440 --> 11:22.440]  at least 6 million dead we know of.
[11:22.440 --> 11:29.440]  This is a genocide of biblical proportions and they're just getting started.
[11:29.440 --> 11:36.440]  And so for all of you that signed on with the New World Order, all of you that signed on for censorship, all of you that signed on for tyranny,
[11:36.440 --> 11:47.440]  I hope you really feel good about yourselves because you are destroying us along with your evil asses.
[11:47.440 --> 11:53.440]  And I understand you get a thrill out of evil, get a thrill out of oppression, you get a thrill out of dominance,
[11:53.440 --> 11:56.440]  and because you sided with the powers that be, you think you're winning.
[11:56.440 --> 12:02.440]  You're only winning for a short season.
[12:02.440 --> 12:06.440]  You're only winning for a very short period and you lose in the end.
[12:06.440 --> 12:16.440]  You may win some battles, but you are and you will lose your war against humanity.
[12:16.440 --> 12:20.440]  Then we've got this big stack of reports.
[12:20.440 --> 12:30.440]  Last week, the World Economic Forum was given $100 million by the Canadian government to establish a World ID.
[12:30.440 --> 12:40.440]  This week, Bill Gates donated $200 million to expand the program and they're using the Communist Chinese World ID as the model,
[12:40.440 --> 12:47.440]  complete with our new Chinese police departments, Communist Chinese departments, we're setting up in every western nation to keep an eye on us.
[12:47.440 --> 12:50.440]  We now have the Chinese Communist World ID system.
[12:50.440 --> 12:53.440]  That's coming up.
[12:53.440 --> 13:03.440]  We'll also tie that in to the Democrats not liking their own medicine.
[13:03.440 --> 13:14.440]  That is just more and more ridiculous, oxymoronic statements by the mayor of DC, the mayor of New York, the mayor of Chicago,
[13:14.440 --> 13:22.440]  and other Democrat mayors saying, we are in an emergency.
[13:22.440 --> 13:25.440]  We can't take any illegal aliens.
[13:25.440 --> 13:29.440]  This is the end of the world.
[13:29.440 --> 13:42.440]  And not understanding the fact, or they do understand the fact, that they're the ones running the policy that caused this.
[13:42.440 --> 13:47.440]  But as soon as it's put in their backyard, they scream bloody murders.
[13:47.440 --> 13:57.440]  We've got some new totally insane clips on that front coming out the start of the next segment that just really show how the millions of the New World Order are pretty stupid.
[13:57.440 --> 14:09.440]  Because I can tell you, the mayor of Chicago, the mayor of New York, the mayor of DC, these are puppets put there because they're stupid.
[14:09.440 --> 14:15.440]  And it's the people behind them running them and controlling them that are the truly evil folks.
[14:15.440 --> 14:27.440]  But Mayor Eric Adams has declared an emergency in New York saying we didn't plan for this, we didn't ask this, we can't handle this, it's got to stop.
[14:27.440 --> 14:31.440]  It's got to stop? You got what, 20,000 illegal aliens, Buster?
[14:31.440 --> 14:33.440]  Texas has got 10 million.
[14:33.440 --> 14:35.440]  Arizona's got more than 10 million.
[14:35.440 --> 14:40.440]  California's got 30 million.
[14:40.440 --> 14:42.440]  How do you like going bankrupt?
[14:42.440 --> 14:46.440]  How do you like all the collapse of society and the social safety net going away?
[14:46.440 --> 14:53.440]  How do you like the third world's poorest people being moved here after the UN cut off their food and water for two years?
[14:53.440 --> 14:56.440]  I don't blame these people coming here, they're refugees in the New World Order.
[14:56.440 --> 15:01.440]  And then a New World Order puppet sits up there, I'm not saying they should be allowed in, I'm just saying I don't hate them.
[15:01.440 --> 15:07.440]  No, I hate the globalists that engineered the collapse of their countries and then shinned them here to collapse us.
[15:07.440 --> 15:10.440]  And that's what this is, is total and complete weaponization.
[15:10.440 --> 15:18.440]  With the crime waves and the homelessness and the fentanyl and all of it, this is war against our country.
[15:18.440 --> 15:24.440]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[15:24.440 --> 15:28.440]  We're going to be laying it all out here with so much more.
[15:28.440 --> 15:34.440]  And as I said, your phone calls, I'll give the number out when we come back on the other side.
[15:34.440 --> 15:40.440]  Infowars.com stands as the beacon of resistance against the globalists.
[15:40.440 --> 15:43.440]  And I thank you all for tuning in today and I thank you all for sharing the links.
[15:43.440 --> 15:46.440]  Because this is the time Infowars was built for.
[15:46.440 --> 15:51.440]  This time in history right now, people are more open minded to the truth than ever.
[15:51.440 --> 15:55.440]  We'll be right back as we battle the great reset of the New World Order.
[15:55.440 --> 16:00.440]  It's our best seller.
[16:00.440 --> 16:05.440]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[16:05.440 --> 16:11.440]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them,
[16:11.440 --> 16:14.440]  it has become our number one overall best seller.
[16:14.440 --> 16:17.440]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[16:17.440 --> 16:21.440]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system,
[16:21.440 --> 16:26.440]  but it helps every cellular function of the body. It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids,
[16:26.440 --> 16:31.440]  all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[16:31.440 --> 16:33.440]  Essential means without these things you die.
[16:33.440 --> 16:37.440]  And so much of the food is debased. There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[16:37.440 --> 16:41.440]  It is critical to bolster our bodies defenses with a product like this.
[16:41.440 --> 16:44.440]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.
[16:44.440 --> 16:48.440]  But this is amongst the very best and it's a low price and it funds the Infowars.

[18:07.440 --> 18:09.440]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[18:09.440 --> 18:12.440]  Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[18:12.440 --> 18:16.440]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[18:16.440 --> 18:19.440]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge yourselves,

[20:00.440 --> 20:05.440]  Leading up Frontal Assault on the Lies of the New World Order,
[20:05.440 --> 20:08.440]  it's Alex Jones.
[20:16.440 --> 20:20.440]  Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladopo is a hero.
[20:20.440 --> 20:23.440]  He's the type of person we need as U.S. Surgeon General.
[20:23.440 --> 20:27.440]  And we need people like Governor Sanis as president.
[20:27.440 --> 20:30.440]  He went on the war room yesterday with Steve Bannon
[20:30.440 --> 20:34.440]  who joins us next hour and laid out the evil, just murderous
[20:34.440 --> 20:39.440]  coordination between big tech and government to silence
[20:39.440 --> 20:42.440]  the medical truth of the weapon we've just been hit with.
[20:42.440 --> 20:46.440]  Dr. Ladopo, did the senior management of Twitter,
[20:46.440 --> 20:48.440]  did any of these social media oligarchs,
[20:48.440 --> 20:53.440]  did anybody reach out to you and ask you for the backup analytics?
[20:53.440 --> 20:55.440]  They asked you about your study?
[20:55.440 --> 20:59.440]  Did you ask you about anything before they took you down, sir?
[20:59.440 --> 21:01.440]  Surely they didn't reach out to me personally.
[21:01.440 --> 21:04.440]  I guess in theory, maybe they reached out to the office,
[21:04.440 --> 21:07.440]  but I've heard no such thing.
[21:07.440 --> 21:14.440]  But you know, this whole, I mean, it is really almost criminal,
[21:14.440 --> 21:19.440]  really, in terms of how much disregard that they have
[21:19.440 --> 21:28.440]  for human rights that, and I'm not talking just about Twitter,
[21:28.440 --> 21:34.440]  but this whole body that thinks it's okay to crush the voices
[21:34.440 --> 21:37.440]  of others because you don't like their message.
[21:37.440 --> 21:42.440]  Here's a message that, this is not a message that is in our
[21:42.440 --> 21:46.440]  interests or in someone else's interests.
[21:46.440 --> 21:49.440]  This is a message in terms of the data, the information
[21:49.440 --> 21:51.440]  that we were providing.
[21:51.440 --> 21:54.440]  It's a message for people, for humanity,
[21:54.440 --> 21:57.440]  so that people can make informed decisions.
[21:57.440 --> 21:59.440]  You want to do more research?
[21:59.440 --> 22:00.440]  Terrific.
[22:00.440 --> 22:02.440]  You think you've already seen enough evidence
[22:02.440 --> 22:05.440]  and you think our methods are persuasive to you,
[22:05.440 --> 22:09.440]  that you believe that our results are great, are correct?
[22:09.440 --> 22:10.440]  Terrific.
[22:10.440 --> 22:14.440]  Like humans, people get to make those choices,
[22:14.440 --> 22:20.440]  but these, this body of tech and other forces that come in
[22:20.440 --> 22:24.440]  and silence people, they don't think human beings
[22:24.440 --> 22:28.440]  have the right to have free access to information
[22:28.440 --> 22:30.440]  that they don't want them to have access to.
[22:30.440 --> 22:32.440]  So it's, I mean, it's, you know, Twitter, yes,
[22:32.440 --> 22:34.440]  but it's a huge deal.
[22:34.440 --> 22:37.440]  He said almost criminal, no, it's mass murder.
[22:37.440 --> 22:40.440]  It's extremely criminal to block tens of thousands of doctors
[22:40.440 --> 22:43.440]  and scientists and millions of citizens telling the truth
[22:43.440 --> 22:46.440]  and what they experienced and how the shots made them sick
[22:46.440 --> 22:48.440]  and how they suppressed all the therapeutics
[22:48.440 --> 22:51.440]  like hydroxychloroquine and, of course,
[22:51.440 --> 22:54.440]  countless other things that are devastating to COVID
[22:54.440 --> 22:59.440]  and incredibly empowering to the body.
[22:59.440 --> 23:02.440]  Unbelievable what these, what these monsters have done
[23:02.440 --> 23:04.440]  to ivermectin and so much more.
[23:04.440 --> 23:07.440]  Now I want to shift gears into the war, big developments
[23:07.440 --> 23:10.440]  on that front, escalations every day.
[23:10.440 --> 23:14.440]  The Russians are now rolled out evidence of an attack drone
[23:14.440 --> 23:20.440]  with a bomb that crashed and unsuccessfully did not detonate,
[23:20.440 --> 23:23.440]  blowing up Nord Stream 1.
[23:23.440 --> 23:25.440]  This turned out to have happened years ago.
[23:25.440 --> 23:27.440]  We're going to be getting to that.
[23:27.440 --> 23:31.440]  Russia is now blowing up and destroying most of the power
[23:31.440 --> 23:34.440]  producing structures in Ukraine.
[23:34.440 --> 23:37.440]  So this has gone from a police action, as Putin called it,
[23:37.440 --> 23:40.440]  to full out war and he's brought in this scorched earth general
[23:40.440 --> 23:43.440]  who has the nickname General Armageddon.
[23:43.440 --> 23:45.440]  So good job, new world order.
[23:45.440 --> 23:51.440]  But I'll play a few clips from years ago of Soros bragging
[23:51.440 --> 23:54.440]  and Obama bragging about what they set up
[23:54.440 --> 23:56.440]  and the overthrow of the government in Ukraine
[23:56.440 --> 23:58.440]  and what it has led to today.
[23:58.440 --> 24:02.440]  We set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became
[24:02.440 --> 24:05.440]  independent of Russia.
[24:05.440 --> 24:10.440]  And the foundation has been functioning ever since.
[24:10.440 --> 24:17.440]  There is one person who was very deeply involved in Ukraine
[24:17.440 --> 24:19.440]  and that's Biden.
[24:19.440 --> 24:23.440]  He had a lot more patience than I had
[24:23.440 --> 24:30.440]  in trying to convert Poroshenko into a democratic leader.
[24:30.440 --> 24:36.440]  But the opportunity to generate a united Ukraine
[24:36.440 --> 24:41.440]  and getting it right is within your grasp.
[24:41.440 --> 24:45.440]  We want to be your partner, your friend in the project,
[24:45.440 --> 24:47.440]  and we're ready to assist.
[24:47.440 --> 24:51.440]  We're also asking Congress to act promptly
[24:51.440 --> 24:54.440]  to deliver on an aid package
[24:54.440 --> 24:57.440]  including a $1 billion loan guarantee
[24:57.440 --> 25:02.440]  that can help smooth the path for reform inside of Ukraine
[25:02.440 --> 25:05.440]  and give the Prime Minister and his government
[25:05.440 --> 25:09.440]  the capacity to do what they need to do as they are also.
[25:09.440 --> 25:12.440]  Now this next clip has been making the rounds
[25:12.440 --> 25:14.440]  from Stephen Colbert.
[25:14.440 --> 25:18.440]  This is in 2014 with an Obama spokesperson,
[25:18.440 --> 25:21.440]  one of the cute little actors.
[25:21.440 --> 25:23.440]  Say that again, guys.
[25:23.440 --> 25:26.440]  Yes, Michael Hudson, thank you for reminding me of his name.
[25:26.440 --> 25:29.440]  Michael Hudson, on there making a joke about the plan
[25:29.440 --> 25:32.440]  for the war and the project to overthrow Ukraine.
[25:32.440 --> 25:34.440]  It's so funny, it's so cute, it's so fun,
[25:34.440 --> 25:36.440]  and now we're living years later
[25:36.440 --> 25:38.440]  on the edge of World War III, here it is.
[25:38.440 --> 25:42.440]  I just wish Ronald Reagan were still alive to fix this mess.
[25:42.440 --> 25:45.440]  Here to tell me how to reanimate Reagan
[25:45.440 --> 25:48.440]  as the editor of Foreign Affairs Magazine, Gideon Rose.
[25:48.440 --> 25:51.440]  Mr. Rose, thank you so much for being here.
[25:51.440 --> 25:55.440]  There's the magazine, Foreign Affairs.
[25:55.440 --> 25:58.440]  Let's just pause right there, let's just stop.
[25:58.440 --> 26:00.440]  It's no big deal.
[26:00.440 --> 26:02.440]  We're going to start this back over.
[26:02.440 --> 26:05.440]  It's Gideon Rose who had worked with the Obama administration.
[26:05.440 --> 26:08.440]  In fact, we're going to stop right there.
[26:08.440 --> 26:11.440]  I'm going to restart the show at this point.
[26:11.440 --> 26:13.440]  I almost didn't do the show today
[26:13.440 --> 26:17.440]  because I got a headache and I'm in a bad mood
[26:17.440 --> 26:21.440]  and I'm just going to reset everything right now.
[26:21.440 --> 26:24.440]  Because I really can't do the show
[26:24.440 --> 26:27.440]  when I am working until 10 minutes before the show
[26:27.440 --> 26:29.440]  on just keeping this place on air.
[26:29.440 --> 26:31.440]  And I should have just taken off the day and had Owen do the show.
[26:31.440 --> 26:33.440]  I should have just worked behind the scenes.
[26:33.440 --> 26:35.440]  In fact, get Owen ready, he's going to take over, I'm leaving.
[26:35.440 --> 26:37.440]  I guess I got Bannon coming up, I got to do it,
[26:37.440 --> 26:49.440]  but I just can't do it anymore.
[26:49.440 --> 26:51.440]  I want you guys to print me the article on the YouTube of that
[26:51.440 --> 26:53.440]  so I have the actual articles.
[26:53.440 --> 26:55.440]  When you click on the YouTube, open it up with the menu under it
[26:55.440 --> 26:57.440]  so I have the description under it.
[26:57.440 --> 26:59.440]  We'll start over. Thank you.
[26:59.440 --> 27:02.440]  Now, I want to calm down for a moment.
[27:02.440 --> 27:06.440]  I'm going to get my bearings and I'll be able to do the show.
[27:06.440 --> 27:10.440]  I may have to go to re-broadcast for a little while.
[27:10.440 --> 27:13.440]  But I'm not mad at anybody.
[27:13.440 --> 27:18.440]  I just get overloaded at a certain point
[27:18.440 --> 27:22.440]  and in the past I spent about 10% of my time getting fun and keep us on air.
[27:22.440 --> 27:25.440]  Now I spend 50% of my time and I'm not complaining.
[27:25.440 --> 27:28.440]  It's just something I don't like doing and it irritates me
[27:28.440 --> 27:30.440]  because I don't like business, I don't like numbers,
[27:30.440 --> 27:32.440]  I don't like jacking and stuff constantly,
[27:32.440 --> 27:34.440]  but the good news is M4 is still on air,
[27:34.440 --> 27:36.440]  so we have a plan to stay on air
[27:36.440 --> 27:38.440]  and it would take a big stress off of me
[27:38.440 --> 27:40.440]  and keep this important operation on air
[27:40.440 --> 27:42.440]  if folks would continue to support what you've been doing
[27:42.440 --> 27:44.440]  and I want to thank you.
[27:44.440 --> 27:46.440]  We're shipping stuff within 24 hours, your order coming in,
[27:46.440 --> 27:48.440]  we've got products you really need right now
[27:48.440 --> 27:50.440]  at infowarstore.com
[27:50.440 --> 27:52.440]  or by calling toll free,
[27:52.440 --> 27:55.440]  triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[27:55.440 --> 27:58.440]  And there's been big runs on iodine
[27:58.440 --> 28:00.440]  because of all the nuclear war news.
[28:00.440 --> 28:02.440]  We don't sell the highest quality iodine
[28:02.440 --> 28:04.440]  in nuclear war because it's not really a protection
[28:04.440 --> 28:06.440]  from nuclear war, folks.
[28:06.440 --> 28:08.440]  Yes, a few isotopes, some of the most common
[28:08.440 --> 28:10.440]  in fallout that go into the thyroid,
[28:10.440 --> 28:12.440]  if your body has good iodine already in your thyroid,
[28:12.440 --> 28:15.440]  it won't absorb the radioactive isotopes
[28:15.440 --> 28:18.440]  and that's one of the main causes of death.
[28:18.440 --> 28:20.440]  But if there's a nuclear war,
[28:20.440 --> 28:22.440]  there'll be mass starvation and total collapse of civilization
[28:22.440 --> 28:24.440]  and so, you know, might as well just go ahead
[28:24.440 --> 28:26.440]  and die quickly in my view.
[28:26.440 --> 28:28.440]  The reason we sell high quality iodine,
[28:28.440 --> 28:30.440]  the highest quality you're going to find anywhere,
[28:30.440 --> 28:33.440]  is because it's incredible for your whole body
[28:33.440 --> 28:36.440]  and when you do have good iodine in the thyroid,
[28:36.440 --> 28:38.440]  it blocks all the bad halogens
[28:38.440 --> 28:41.440]  like fluorine, fluoride, bromide, you name it.
[28:41.440 --> 28:45.440]  So, X3 is back in stock, 50% off,
[28:45.440 --> 28:48.440]  and I've extended the big supercell for a few more days,
[28:48.440 --> 28:51.440]  40-50% off, store-wide, infowarstore.com,
[28:51.440 --> 28:55.440]  on Brainforce Plus, Brainforce Ultra,
[28:55.440 --> 28:59.440]  vitamin C with zinc and more.
[28:59.440 --> 29:01.440]  It's our best seller.
[29:01.440 --> 29:03.440]  We first came out with it five years ago
[29:03.440 --> 29:05.440]  and it was a moderate seller.
[29:05.440 --> 29:07.440]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion
[29:07.440 --> 29:09.440]  and experienced the way it made it feel
[29:09.440 --> 29:11.440]  and how healthy it made them,
[29:11.440 --> 29:14.440]  it has become our number one overall best seller
[29:14.440 --> 29:16.440]  and it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[29:16.440 --> 29:20.440]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system,
[29:20.440 --> 29:23.440]  but it helps every cellular function of the body
[29:23.440 --> 29:26.440]  and has all the minerals, all the key amino acids,
[29:26.440 --> 29:30.440]  all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[29:30.440 --> 29:33.440]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[29:33.440 --> 29:35.440]  And so much of the food is debased.
[29:35.440 --> 29:37.440]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[29:37.440 --> 29:40.440]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses
[29:40.440 --> 29:41.440]  with a product like this.
[29:41.440 --> 29:44.440]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there,
[29:44.440 --> 29:46.440]  but this is amongst the very best,
[29:46.440 --> 29:48.440]  and it's a low price, and it funds the infowar.
[29:48.440 --> 29:50.440]  So, the only way you lose is not taking action today,
[29:50.440 --> 29:53.440]  getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock
[29:53.440 --> 29:56.440]  at infowarstore.com for a 50% off.
[29:56.440 --> 29:59.440]  Vitamin mineral fusion, back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[29:59.440 --> 30:04.440]  Think about a world without info wars.
[30:04.440 --> 30:06.440]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about
[30:06.440 --> 30:09.440]  all the incredible guests and callers and stories
[30:09.440 --> 30:13.440]  we've broken together, this family that is info wars.
[30:13.440 --> 30:18.440]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson
[30:18.440 --> 30:22.440]  and Bal Senaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage
[30:22.440 --> 30:27.440]  as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base
[30:27.440 --> 30:30.440]  to defeat the New World Order.
[30:30.440 --> 30:33.440]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[30:33.440 --> 30:37.440]  is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast
[30:37.440 --> 30:40.440]  have taken action and supported this show.
[30:40.440 --> 30:42.440]  I don't take the credit.
[30:42.440 --> 30:44.440]  I give you the credit.
[30:44.440 --> 30:46.440]  And now info wars is facing its darkest hours.
[30:46.440 --> 30:48.440]  It isn't going to give up.
[30:48.440 --> 30:50.440]  Without your support, we can be shut down.
[30:50.440 --> 30:53.440]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today.
[30:53.440 --> 30:59.440]  Saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[30:59.440 --> 31:01.440]  Look around you.
[31:01.440 --> 31:04.440]  Everything I predicted from the global stone documents
[31:04.440 --> 31:06.440]  from their own admissions is now happening.
[31:06.440 --> 31:08.440]  Info wars credibility.
[31:08.440 --> 31:10.440]  My credibility has never been higher.
[31:10.440 --> 31:12.440]  And it's because of your backing of this operation
[31:12.440 --> 31:15.440]  that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship
[31:15.440 --> 31:18.440]  and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits
[31:18.440 --> 31:20.440]  stay on air.
[31:20.440 --> 31:22.440]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture
[31:22.440 --> 31:25.440]  in the fight together.
[31:25.440 --> 31:29.440]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[31:29.440 --> 31:32.440]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[31:32.440 --> 31:34.440]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court
[31:34.440 --> 31:36.440]  to pay for 40% of the legal fees,
[31:36.440 --> 31:38.440]  and I can't fund those myself.
[31:38.440 --> 31:40.440]  It's unsustainable.
[31:40.440 --> 31:44.440]  So please visit saveinfowars.com.
[31:44.440 --> 31:47.440]  Saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations
[31:47.440 --> 31:50.440]  five, 10, $500, whatever you can
[31:50.440 --> 31:52.440]  so that I can continue to persevere.
[31:52.440 --> 31:54.440]  I'll never give up. I'll never give in.
[31:54.440 --> 31:55.440]  But I could give out.
[31:55.440 --> 31:56.440]  Thank you for your support.
[31:56.440 --> 31:57.440]  Wouldn't be without you.
[31:57.440 --> 31:59.440]  Saveinfowars.com.
[31:59.440 --> 32:02.440]  Look, it's not hype that info wars has changed the world.
[32:02.440 --> 32:04.440]  It's not hype that your support of info wars
[32:04.440 --> 32:06.440]  is the reason we were able to do this.
[32:06.440 --> 32:08.440]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[32:08.440 --> 32:11.440]  Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen
[32:11.440 --> 32:12.440]  on the periodic table.
[32:12.440 --> 32:14.440]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen
[32:14.440 --> 32:16.440]  and does the opposite of fluoride.
[32:16.440 --> 32:18.440]  And when you've got it in your body,
[32:18.440 --> 32:19.440]  it doesn't just supercharge yourselves,
[32:19.440 --> 32:20.440]  it doesn't just give you more energy,

[33:28.440 --> 33:30.440]  Hell, I pay the price.
[33:30.440 --> 33:33.440]  All I want is to be left alone in my average life.
[33:33.440 --> 33:35.440]  All right, I want to open the phones up

[33:55.440 --> 33:57.440]  Let me give back to where we were.
[33:57.440 --> 33:59.440]  So I just played you a clip of George Soros and Obama
[33:59.440 --> 34:02.440]  bragging out of the overthrow of Ukraine.
[34:02.440 --> 34:05.440]  And there's countless other clips of him saying it as well.
[34:05.440 --> 34:10.440]  And then we have this clip from Stephen Colbert's program
[34:10.440 --> 34:14.440]  back in 2014, talking to a council on foreign relations
[34:14.440 --> 34:18.440]  globalist member, Gideon Rose.
[34:18.440 --> 34:22.440]  And there they are laughing and giggling
[34:22.440 --> 34:25.440]  about the whole project to basically take over
[34:25.440 --> 34:27.440]  and overthrow Ukraine, the birthplace
[34:27.440 --> 34:29.440]  of the Slavic Russian culture.
[34:29.440 --> 34:31.440]  Go back a thousand years ago,
[34:31.440 --> 34:34.440]  his name was basically translated Slav the Great.
[34:34.440 --> 34:36.440]  His last name was Slav.
[34:36.440 --> 34:39.440]  I'm not good at Slavic tongue, I apologize.
[34:39.440 --> 34:41.440]  Anybody can look this up.
[34:41.440 --> 34:44.440]  So Russian culture started in central Ukraine today,
[34:44.440 --> 34:46.440]  or Slavic culture.
[34:46.440 --> 34:48.440]  It doesn't matter if you're Polish,
[34:48.440 --> 34:50.440]  it doesn't matter if you're Serbian,
[34:50.440 --> 34:52.440]  it doesn't matter if you're Russian,
[34:52.440 --> 34:54.440]  Belarusian, it's all the same culture.
[34:54.440 --> 34:56.440]  And so this is a big deal of the Russians
[34:56.440 --> 34:58.440]  to have this being taken away,
[34:58.440 --> 35:00.440]  and so now you've got a war.
[35:00.440 --> 35:02.440]  And now the war is escalating out of control,
[35:02.440 --> 35:05.440]  but here they are years ago laying the groundwork
[35:05.440 --> 35:09.440]  now eight years ago
[35:09.440 --> 35:12.440]  for exactly what has happened,
[35:12.440 --> 35:14.440]  the overthrow of the Ukrainian government
[35:14.440 --> 35:16.440]  and a puppet that has now been installed.
[35:16.440 --> 35:19.440]  And that's why we're sliding into
[35:19.440 --> 35:22.440]  a thermonuclear war and economic collapse right now.
[35:22.440 --> 35:24.440]  Here is the disgusting clip.
[35:24.440 --> 35:27.440]  I just wish Ronald Reagan were still alive
[35:27.440 --> 35:29.440]  to fix this mess.
[35:29.440 --> 35:31.440]  Here to tell me how to reanimate Reagan
[35:31.440 --> 35:33.440]  is the editor of Foreign Affairs magazine,
[35:33.440 --> 35:35.440]  Gideon Rose.
[35:35.440 --> 35:37.440]  Mr. Rose, thank you so much for being here.
[35:37.440 --> 35:39.440]  Yeah, he's a warmonger.
[35:39.440 --> 35:41.440]  Here's the magazine, Foreign Affairs.
[35:41.440 --> 35:45.440]  Now, Gideon, help me out here.
[35:45.440 --> 35:47.440]  We've got a battle.
[35:47.440 --> 35:49.440]  I mean, some of them want to go into the EU,
[35:49.440 --> 35:51.440]  the European Union,
[35:51.440 --> 35:53.440]  and some of them want to stay with Russia.
[35:53.440 --> 35:55.440]  If the Ukraine's not in Europe right now,
[35:55.440 --> 35:57.440]  what continent is it on?
[35:57.440 --> 35:59.440]  Well, it's part of Eurasia,
[35:59.440 --> 36:01.440]  but it's part of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet bloc.
[36:01.440 --> 36:04.440]  It's basically robbing to Russia as Batman.
[36:04.440 --> 36:09.440]  And the challenge here is to try to attract it to the West
[36:09.440 --> 36:11.440]  to get it to flip sides.
[36:11.440 --> 36:14.440]  So the rebels in the streets, what are they fighting for?
[36:14.440 --> 36:16.440]  They're fighting for a better future.
[36:16.440 --> 36:18.440]  That sounds like a political speech.
[36:18.440 --> 36:20.440]  No, but it's actually true.
[36:20.440 --> 36:22.440]  Countries have to develop over time,
[36:22.440 --> 36:24.440]  and Ukraine, basically, after the end of the Soviet Union,
[36:24.440 --> 36:26.440]  faced two tracks.
[36:26.440 --> 36:29.440]  It could stay a sort of stagnant, corrupt, authoritarian country
[36:29.440 --> 36:31.440]  tied to Russia,
[36:31.440 --> 36:33.440]  or it could essentially join the West.
[36:33.440 --> 36:36.440]  It could modernize, liberalize, become a democracy.
[36:36.440 --> 36:39.440]  At the last minute, when it looked like it was going to trade up
[36:39.440 --> 36:41.440]  from its sort of abusive relationship
[36:41.440 --> 36:44.440]  with its boyfriend from the hood to a nice, yuppie...
[36:44.440 --> 36:47.440]  You're not loading these choices in any way whatsoever.
[36:47.440 --> 36:49.440]  It's actually true.
[36:49.440 --> 36:52.440]  When it looked like it was going to trade up to a better environment,
[36:52.440 --> 36:54.440]  at the last minute, Putin offered a bribe.
[36:54.440 --> 36:55.440]  How much?
[36:55.440 --> 36:56.440]  $15 billion.
[36:56.440 --> 36:57.440]  It's a lot of cash, man.
[36:57.440 --> 36:58.440]  It's a lot of cash.
[36:58.440 --> 37:01.440]  And the president, who himself was tied to the old elites
[37:01.440 --> 37:03.440]  and the eastern part of the country who thought it was Russia,
[37:03.440 --> 37:06.440]  decided to back off the change and go join Russia.
[37:06.440 --> 37:08.440]  Do you know how many pirate-themed restaurants
[37:08.440 --> 37:10.440]  you can buy with $15 billion?
[37:10.440 --> 37:13.440]  The problem was the western parts of the country
[37:13.440 --> 37:15.440]  and the younger parts of the country,
[37:15.440 --> 37:17.440]  and the more modern liberal parts of the country,
[37:17.440 --> 37:20.440]  basically knew that they had no future being Russia's vassal.
[37:20.440 --> 37:21.440]  Do we...
[37:21.440 --> 37:22.440]  And so they took to the streets.
[37:22.440 --> 37:24.440]  Is America taking sides in this in any way?
[37:24.440 --> 37:25.440]  If these people...
[37:25.440 --> 37:27.440]  The rebels are winning that right now, right?
[37:27.440 --> 37:28.440]  Yes, just recently.
[37:28.440 --> 37:31.440]  Why isn't Obama spiking the ball in the end zone
[37:31.440 --> 37:32.440]  and calling Putin and saying,
[37:32.440 --> 37:34.440]  hey, you might have won the medal count,
[37:34.440 --> 37:36.440]  but we won the country count.
[37:36.440 --> 37:39.440]  It's actually a very good question.
[37:39.440 --> 37:42.440]  And the answer is that we don't want Russia
[37:42.440 --> 37:45.440]  to intervene and kick over the table like a game of risk
[37:45.440 --> 37:46.440]  and take Ukraine back.
[37:46.440 --> 37:47.440]  Do they do that?
[37:47.440 --> 37:48.440]  Could he send in troops?
[37:48.440 --> 37:49.440]  Yes, he could.
[37:49.440 --> 37:50.440]  So we are choosing...
[37:50.440 --> 37:52.440]  Does Ukraine have any troops of their own?
[37:52.440 --> 37:53.440]  Would they fight back?
[37:53.440 --> 37:54.440]  Yes, but we don't want this to escalate
[37:54.440 --> 37:56.440]  and we don't want Russia to crack down.
[37:56.440 --> 37:58.440]  So we want to basically distract Russia.
[37:58.440 --> 38:00.440]  Oh, look, you have the highest medal count.
[38:00.440 --> 38:02.440]  Oh, you did really well.
[38:02.440 --> 38:04.440]  And, you know, focus on the Olympics.
[38:04.440 --> 38:05.440]  There's a shiny object.
[38:05.440 --> 38:06.440]  Focus on...
[38:06.440 --> 38:10.440]  Take an entire country away from you.
[38:10.440 --> 38:12.440]  Basically...
[38:12.440 --> 38:14.440]  There's a power vacuum right now.
[38:14.440 --> 38:15.440]  There's a power vacuum.
[38:15.440 --> 38:16.440]  The opposition is all together,
[38:16.440 --> 38:17.440]  which everybody...
[38:17.440 --> 38:19.440]  It's easy to agree on getting rid of the bad old regime
[38:19.440 --> 38:22.440]  and much harder to create a stable country
[38:22.440 --> 38:24.440]  in which everybody compromises and moves forward.
[38:24.440 --> 38:27.440]  But they need a strong leader to move the country forward.
[38:27.440 --> 38:29.440]  Do you know who's always good at a moment like that?
[38:29.440 --> 38:31.440]  Vladimir Putin.
[38:31.440 --> 38:33.440]  Do you think he might volunteer to come in
[38:33.440 --> 38:36.440]  and help Ukraine find its way?
[38:36.440 --> 38:37.440]  The reason we don't want...
[38:37.440 --> 38:39.440]  We don't want Putin to get involved in this.
[38:39.440 --> 38:40.440]  And so we are basically...
[38:40.440 --> 38:42.440]  We want to try and involve him in this decision
[38:42.440 --> 38:45.440]  so that he allows Ukraine to go.
[38:45.440 --> 38:46.440]  We actually want to not...
[38:46.440 --> 38:47.440]  We want to say,
[38:47.440 --> 38:49.440]  we want a non-exclusive relationship with Ukraine.
[38:49.440 --> 38:50.440]  You can have a relationship with it, too.
[38:50.440 --> 38:51.440]  You're the only one making this
[38:51.440 --> 38:53.440]  into a girlfriend-boyfriend relationship.
[38:53.440 --> 38:55.440]  Ukraine is basically choosing its future
[38:55.440 --> 38:58.440]  between two completely different courses of action.
[38:58.440 --> 38:59.440]  And we're trying to blur that choice
[38:59.440 --> 39:01.440]  so the old boyfriend doesn't get too upset
[39:01.440 --> 39:04.440]  when it makes the right choice towards us.
[39:04.440 --> 39:08.440]  You might punch us in the face.
[39:08.440 --> 39:09.440]  Well, thank you so much.
[39:09.440 --> 39:11.440]  Gideon Rose.
[39:11.440 --> 39:12.440]  Gideon Rose.
[39:12.440 --> 39:13.440]  So that's what they do,
[39:13.440 --> 39:14.440]  is they have foreign affairs,
[39:14.440 --> 39:16.440]  the publication of the New World Order,
[39:16.440 --> 39:17.440]  the globalists that want to end our country
[39:17.440 --> 39:18.440]  in their own admissions,
[39:18.440 --> 39:19.440]  up there selling World War III,
[39:19.440 --> 39:20.440]  and now here we are.
[39:20.440 --> 39:21.440]  Now, here's a new clip.
[39:21.440 --> 39:22.440]  It just came out today.
[39:22.440 --> 39:24.440]  This is a Nobel Prize winner.
[39:24.440 --> 39:25.440]  Just got it.
[39:25.440 --> 39:28.440]  Oleksandr Matvilichuk
[39:28.440 --> 39:31.440]  is standing beside the Kiev playground
[39:31.440 --> 39:33.440]  that was hit by a piece of Russian missile
[39:33.440 --> 39:34.440]  calling for Ukraine to be given
[39:34.440 --> 39:35.440]  advanced air defense systems.
[39:35.440 --> 39:37.440]  So, again, you get peace prizes
[39:37.440 --> 39:39.440]  now for calling for expanded wars.
[39:39.440 --> 39:42.440]  Here's the clip.
[39:42.440 --> 39:44.440]  My name is Oleksandr Matvilichuk.
[39:44.440 --> 39:47.440]  I'm head of Center for Civil Liberties.
[39:47.440 --> 39:50.440]  Our organization received this week
[39:50.440 --> 39:53.440]  the Nobel Peace Prize.
[39:53.440 --> 39:55.440]  I am in the center of Kiev
[39:55.440 --> 39:58.440]  near the children's playground
[39:58.440 --> 40:01.440]  where a lot of children
[40:01.440 --> 40:05.440]  with their parents are playing every day.
[40:05.440 --> 40:07.440]  This children's playground
[40:07.440 --> 40:11.440]  was hit by Russian rockets today.
[40:11.440 --> 40:17.440]  Near, you can see the National Tarashevchenko University.
[40:17.440 --> 40:20.440]  It's my alma mater
[40:20.440 --> 40:24.440]  where I have studied for years.
[40:24.440 --> 40:26.440]  There is no military necessity
[40:26.440 --> 40:29.440]  in hitting these objects.
[40:29.440 --> 40:32.440]  Russians did these things
[40:32.440 --> 40:34.440]  because they could.
[40:34.440 --> 40:36.440]  We ask international community
[40:36.440 --> 40:38.440]  to recognize Russia
[40:38.440 --> 40:41.440]  as a state sponsor of terrorism.
[40:41.440 --> 40:43.440]  We ask international community
[40:43.440 --> 40:45.440]  to provide Ukraine
[40:45.440 --> 40:48.440]  the modern air defense systems.
[40:48.440 --> 40:53.440]  We ask to stop this circle of impunity
[40:53.440 --> 40:56.440]  to create international tribunal
[40:56.440 --> 40:59.440]  and hold Putin Lukashenko
[40:59.440 --> 41:03.440]  and other war criminals accountable.
[41:03.440 --> 41:06.440]  By the way, I'm not defending the Russian invasion of Ukraine
[41:06.440 --> 41:08.440]  any more than I'm defending the globalist start
[41:08.440 --> 41:09.440]  and the whole thing,
[41:09.440 --> 41:10.440]  but if you look at the playground,
[41:10.440 --> 41:11.440]  there's not even a crater.
[41:11.440 --> 41:14.440]  The people wandering around were supposedly a bomb fell,
[41:14.440 --> 41:16.440]  obviously off-target if it even did.
[41:16.440 --> 41:18.440]  They're just lying.
[41:18.440 --> 41:19.440]  And why do we know that?
[41:19.440 --> 41:21.440]  This woman was given a Nobel Peace Prize
[41:21.440 --> 41:23.440]  because she's a warmongering fraud,
[41:23.440 --> 41:26.440]  just like Henry Kissinger was given a Peace Prize,
[41:26.440 --> 41:28.440]  or Obama was given one.
[41:28.440 --> 41:30.440]  Why don't they give Hitler one posthumously?
[41:30.440 --> 41:32.440]  So I want to see the crater.
[41:32.440 --> 41:34.440]  I want to see where the playground got hit.
[41:34.440 --> 41:37.440]  These are the same folks that lied and talked about,
[41:37.440 --> 41:40.440]  oh, everybody got killed on this island,
[41:40.440 --> 41:42.440]  on Snake Island by the Russians.
[41:42.440 --> 41:43.440]  It wasn't true.
[41:43.440 --> 41:47.440]  And a man shot a Russian middown with a shotgun wasn't true.
[41:47.440 --> 41:49.440]  And there were Russian mass graves.
[41:49.440 --> 41:50.440]  Was it true?
[41:50.440 --> 41:51.440]  Was it true?
[41:51.440 --> 41:52.440]  Was it true?
[41:52.440 --> 41:53.440]  Was it true?
[41:53.440 --> 41:54.440]  Was it true?
[41:54.440 --> 41:55.440]  Was it true?
[41:55.440 --> 41:58.440]  Over and over again.
[41:58.440 --> 42:03.440]  Yes, are now military and government sites being hit
[42:03.440 --> 42:05.440]  and are shrapnel flying into the public?
[42:05.440 --> 42:06.440]  Yeah.
[42:06.440 --> 42:09.440]  Because they've been launching attacks inside Russia
[42:09.440 --> 42:11.440]  and in Russian annexed areas.
[42:11.440 --> 42:15.440]  So now the war is going from the Vogue photo shoots
[42:15.440 --> 42:17.440]  and everybody, there you go.
[42:17.440 --> 42:19.440]  There's a crater on the edge of the playground.
[42:19.440 --> 42:21.440]  That's what we need to see.
[42:21.440 --> 42:26.440]  Now it's all gone from some distant thing
[42:26.440 --> 42:28.440]  that they're doing to the Russians to now it's happening to them.
[42:28.440 --> 42:29.440]  It's a tragedy.
[42:29.440 --> 42:33.440]  And I'm absolutely against it, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:33.440 --> 42:37.440]  And I'm against World War III and I think it's terrible.
[42:37.440 --> 42:40.440]  Absolutely terrible.
[42:40.440 --> 42:41.440]  But that's where we are.
[42:41.440 --> 42:47.440]  Now when we come back, we got a very special clip
[42:47.440 --> 42:49.440]  that's going viral.
[42:49.440 --> 42:50.440]  Wait till we get there.
[42:50.440 --> 42:59.440]  We'll play it coming up and then Steve Bannon joins us.
[42:59.440 --> 43:01.440]  It's our best seller.
[43:01.440 --> 43:03.440]  We first came out with it five years ago
[43:03.440 --> 43:05.440]  and it was a moderate seller.
[43:05.440 --> 43:07.440]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion
[43:07.440 --> 43:09.440]  and experienced the way it made it feel
[43:09.440 --> 43:11.440]  and how healthy it made them,
[43:11.440 --> 43:14.440]  it has become our number one overall best seller.
[43:14.440 --> 43:15.440]  And it's been sold out for a while
[43:15.440 --> 43:16.440]  but it's finally back in stock.
[43:16.440 --> 43:19.440]  Vitamin mineral fusion, does it just supercharge
[43:19.440 --> 43:20.440]  your immune system?
[43:20.440 --> 43:23.440]  But it helps every cellular function of the body.
[43:23.440 --> 43:26.440]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids,
[43:26.440 --> 43:29.440]  all of the essential vitamins that you need to live
[43:29.440 --> 43:30.440]  and be healthy.
[43:30.440 --> 43:32.440]  Essential means without these things you die.
[43:32.440 --> 43:34.440]  And so much of the food is debased.
[43:34.440 --> 43:36.440]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[43:36.440 --> 43:39.440]  It is critical to bolster our body defenses
[43:39.440 --> 43:41.440]  with a product like this.
[43:41.440 --> 43:43.440]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.
[43:43.440 --> 43:45.440]  But this is amongst the very best
[43:45.440 --> 43:47.440]  and it's a low price and it funds the info war.
[43:47.440 --> 43:50.440]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today,
[43:50.440 --> 43:52.440]  getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock

[45:51.440 --> 45:53.440]  Thank you for your support.
[45:53.440 --> 45:56.440]  The only way you lose is not going to infowarstore.com

[45:59.440 --> 46:03.440]  Think about a world without info wars.
[46:03.440 --> 46:05.440]  Just take a moment and sit back
[46:05.440 --> 46:08.440]  and think about all the incredible guests
[46:08.440 --> 46:10.440]  and callers and stories we've broken together.
[46:10.440 --> 46:13.440]  This family that is info wars.
[46:13.440 --> 46:16.440]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan
[46:16.440 --> 46:18.440]  and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro
[46:18.440 --> 46:22.440]  and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage
[46:22.440 --> 46:26.440]  as being the main impetus towards firing up
[46:26.440 --> 46:29.440]  their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[46:29.440 --> 46:33.440]  The only reason humanity's still in the fight today
[46:33.440 --> 46:36.440]  is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast
[46:36.440 --> 46:39.440]  have taken action and supported this show.
[46:39.440 --> 46:41.440]  I don't take the credit.
[46:41.440 --> 46:43.440]  I give you the credit.
[46:43.440 --> 46:46.440]  And now info wars is facing its darkest hours.
[46:46.440 --> 46:47.440]  It isn't going to give up.
[46:47.440 --> 46:49.440]  Without your support we can be shut down.

[47:14.440 --> 47:16.440]  Welcome back to this Tuesday edition
[47:16.440 --> 47:17.440]  of the Alex Jones Show.
[47:17.440 --> 47:19.440]  Very blessed honor to be here.
[47:19.440 --> 47:21.440]  He's got a lot of big breaking news coming up.
[47:21.440 --> 47:23.440]  The one and only Steve Bannon joining us
[47:23.440 --> 47:24.440]  starting the next hour.
[47:24.440 --> 47:26.440]  He'll be gone 30 minutes into the hour
[47:26.440 --> 47:28.440]  and then right back to your phone calls.
[47:28.440 --> 47:30.440]  I'm going to go to some of your phone calls in Australia
[47:30.440 --> 47:33.440]  and Texas and Maryland and Arizona and New Jersey
[47:33.440 --> 47:34.440]  here in a moment.
[47:34.440 --> 47:36.440]  But I wanted to play this clip that's gone super viral.
[47:36.440 --> 47:40.440]  My old friend Joe Rogan here in Austin yesterday
[47:40.440 --> 47:44.440]  questioning the founder of Rolling Stone magazine,
[47:44.440 --> 47:46.440]  Jan Winner.
[47:46.440 --> 47:50.440]  And this is the perfect old hippie.
[47:50.440 --> 47:53.440]  He launches Rolling Stone about the drug culture
[47:53.440 --> 47:55.440]  and free speech and all this.
[47:55.440 --> 47:58.440]  And now he says the government's got to censor everybody.
[47:58.440 --> 48:00.440]  The government's got to control everybody.
[48:00.440 --> 48:03.440]  And that's how the left has fully embraced authoritarianism,
[48:03.440 --> 48:05.440]  totalitarianism, communism, fascism,
[48:05.440 --> 48:07.440]  whatever you want to call it.
[48:07.440 --> 48:10.440]  And says the government should decide, like the FDA,
[48:10.440 --> 48:12.440]  what food you can eat.
[48:12.440 --> 48:15.440]  And he uses the example of the FDA does such a great job
[48:15.440 --> 48:18.440]  with drugs and Joe Rogan nails him saying
[48:18.440 --> 48:22.440]  25% of drugs get recalled.
[48:22.440 --> 48:25.440]  And now the FDA is a rubber stamp of big pharma.
[48:25.440 --> 48:28.440]  So listen to these old, and I'm not against old people
[48:28.440 --> 48:32.440]  in general, but these old leftists are the worst.
[48:32.440 --> 48:34.440]  And this is what they believe across the board.
[48:34.440 --> 48:35.440]  Here he is.
[48:35.440 --> 48:36.440]  Regulate the internet.
[48:36.440 --> 48:37.440]  Absolutely.
[48:37.440 --> 48:40.440]  You trust the people that got us into the Iraq war
[48:40.440 --> 48:42.440]  under false pretenses to regulate the internet?
[48:42.440 --> 48:44.440]  Do you think that makes any sense?
[48:44.440 --> 48:45.440]  Well, wait a minute.
[48:45.440 --> 48:48.440]  I would not.
[48:48.440 --> 48:49.440]  Hit pause.
[48:49.440 --> 48:50.440]  Bring it back to the beginning.
[48:50.440 --> 48:51.440]  I want to say something here.
[48:51.440 --> 48:53.440]  I covered this six years ago, five years ago.
[48:53.440 --> 48:55.440]  It was in mainline government documents,
[48:55.440 --> 48:57.440]  mainline Wall Street Journal reports saying,
[48:57.440 --> 48:59.440]  don't worry about dinosaur media.
[48:59.440 --> 49:01.440]  Don't worry about legacy media.
[49:01.440 --> 49:03.440]  We've got a plan to censor the left and the right
[49:03.440 --> 49:06.440]  starting with WikiLeaks and Alex Jones.
[49:06.440 --> 49:12.440]  And when we're done with them, we're going to censor everybody.
[49:12.440 --> 49:16.440]  Now the Secretary of State in Texas came out and attacked me
[49:16.440 --> 49:18.440]  all over the news today and said,
[49:18.440 --> 49:22.440]  I caused threats on election officials questioning the
[49:22.440 --> 49:24.440]  Texas election in 2020.
[49:24.440 --> 49:26.440]  I didn't question the Texas election.
[49:26.440 --> 49:28.440]  Trump won.
[49:28.440 --> 49:29.440]  The Republicans won here.
[49:29.440 --> 49:31.440]  Yeah, there was some fraud, but I barely covered it.
[49:31.440 --> 49:33.440]  And now they want to sue me and take me off air for that
[49:33.440 --> 49:36.440]  because they had an FBI agent, never knew who he was,
[49:36.440 --> 49:38.440]  never said his name, who was involved in Sandy Hook
[49:38.440 --> 49:39.440]  responding to it.
[49:39.440 --> 49:43.440]  He sued me for $550 million, never said his name.
[49:43.440 --> 49:46.440]  So now if you criticize the government response
[49:46.440 --> 49:48.440]  or you criticize government period,
[49:48.440 --> 49:50.440]  the bureaucrats are going to sue you.
[49:50.440 --> 49:57.440]  That's all over the news today.
[49:57.440 --> 50:01.440]  Yahoo, AP Reuters, Republican Texas election chief,
[50:01.440 --> 50:06.440]  blasts, nuts, peddling 2020 conspiracy theories
[50:06.440 --> 50:11.440]  and zooms in on Alex Jones because I'm the target.
[50:11.440 --> 50:14.440]  For now, more lawsuits against you criticize government,
[50:14.440 --> 50:17.440]  the bureaucrats sue you.
[50:17.440 --> 50:19.440]  I told you, it's not about me, it's about you.
[50:19.440 --> 50:24.440]  But let's get back to the founder,
[50:24.440 --> 50:30.440]  Jan Winner, of Rolling Stone and just listen to this dirtbag.
[50:30.440 --> 50:31.440]  Here it is.
[50:31.440 --> 50:32.440]  I meant to regulate the internet.
[50:32.440 --> 50:33.440]  Absolutely.
[50:33.440 --> 50:36.440]  You trust the people that got us into the Iraq war
[50:36.440 --> 50:39.440]  under false pretenses to regulate the internet?
[50:39.440 --> 50:41.440]  Do you think that makes any sense?
[50:41.440 --> 50:42.440]  Well, wait a minute.
[50:42.440 --> 50:43.440]  I would not.
[50:43.440 --> 50:45.440]  The people who got us into the Iraq war.
[50:45.440 --> 50:46.440]  It's the government.
[50:46.440 --> 50:47.440]  Where's the politicians?
[50:47.440 --> 50:49.440]  It's the government.
[50:49.440 --> 50:51.440]  In the end, yes, it's the government.
[50:51.440 --> 50:53.440]  But who else is going to regulate it?
[50:53.440 --> 50:54.440]  But if they're going to be in power
[50:54.440 --> 50:55.440]  and they're regulating the internet,
[50:55.440 --> 50:56.440]  they're going to regulate the internet
[50:56.440 --> 50:58.440]  in a way that suits their best interests.
[50:58.440 --> 51:00.440]  The same way they do with the banking industry,
[51:00.440 --> 51:02.440]  the same way they do with the environment,
[51:02.440 --> 51:04.440]  the same way they do with energy,
[51:04.440 --> 51:06.440]  the same way they do with everything.
[51:06.440 --> 51:08.440]  What represents their interests?
[51:08.440 --> 51:11.440]  You're talking about so much money
[51:11.440 --> 51:13.440]  involved in disseminating information
[51:13.440 --> 51:15.440]  in a very particular way.
[51:15.440 --> 51:18.440]  Right now, the internet companies are rich beyond belief.
[51:18.440 --> 51:21.440]  Yeah, but it's a disruptive thing
[51:21.440 --> 51:23.440]  that has never existed before.
[51:23.440 --> 51:25.440]  I think it exists.
[51:25.440 --> 51:28.440]  And I think where we're at is where we're at.
[51:28.440 --> 51:32.440]  I think we need to move forward collectively as a country
[51:32.440 --> 51:36.440]  with an ethic that respects truth
[51:36.440 --> 51:40.440]  and that appreciates opinions and reality
[51:40.440 --> 51:42.440]  and an understanding of things
[51:42.440 --> 51:45.440]  that's not necessarily possible
[51:45.440 --> 51:46.440]  with corporate interests
[51:46.440 --> 51:48.440]  involved in dissemination of information.
[51:48.440 --> 51:51.440]  But there's no way to do that except through the government.
[51:51.440 --> 51:55.440]  There's no way you can do that except through the government.
[51:55.440 --> 51:57.440]  Human nature is not going to change.
[51:57.440 --> 51:59.440]  The government's not going to change either.
[51:59.440 --> 52:01.440]  But the government is capable of changing.
[52:01.440 --> 52:04.440]  The government regulates, for example, the food supply.
[52:04.440 --> 52:06.440]  Or it can regulate...
[52:06.440 --> 52:08.440]  The food supply.
[52:08.440 --> 52:10.440]  Yeah, the Department of Agriculture...
[52:10.440 --> 52:13.440]  Why have they let glyphosate infestate all of our foods?
[52:13.440 --> 52:15.440]  That's one thing.
[52:15.440 --> 52:16.440]  Yeah, but that's a problem.
[52:16.440 --> 52:18.440]  That's the government regulating...
[52:18.440 --> 52:20.440]  Well, then we better get better politicians than them
[52:20.440 --> 52:22.440]  to import better people.
[52:22.440 --> 52:26.440]  I guess, again, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
[52:26.440 --> 52:30.440]  So let's take the SEC
[52:30.440 --> 52:32.440]  or take the Food and Drug Administration's
[52:32.440 --> 52:34.440]  Regulatory Big Pharma.
[52:34.440 --> 52:38.440]  On the one hand, we've got a very safe supply of drugs in this country.
[52:38.440 --> 52:40.440]  Safe.
[52:40.440 --> 52:42.440]  Drugs are tested.
[52:42.440 --> 52:45.440]  You don't get too many bad drugs.
[52:45.440 --> 52:47.440]  You know, prescribed drugs.
[52:47.440 --> 52:51.440]  25% of all drugs approved by the FDA get recalled.
[52:51.440 --> 52:55.440]  So that old authoritarian communist is filthy rich.
[52:55.440 --> 52:57.440]  We want you to be poor.
[52:57.440 --> 52:59.440]  He just said, human nature doesn't change.
[52:59.440 --> 53:01.440]  We can't trust the public with speech.
[53:01.440 --> 53:02.440]  But government can change.
[53:02.440 --> 53:05.440]  We can trust the government.
[53:05.440 --> 53:08.440]  The whole country's founded on us having free speech,
[53:08.440 --> 53:09.440]  unlike other countries.
[53:09.440 --> 53:11.440]  That's why people wanted to come here.
[53:11.440 --> 53:12.440]  One of the main reasons.
[53:12.440 --> 53:16.440]  This guy's anti-American.
[53:16.440 --> 53:20.440]  And then, Joe Rogan talks about,
[53:20.440 --> 53:24.440]  we need to have a culture of values that's for free speech.
[53:24.440 --> 53:26.440]  And he's like, yeah.
[53:26.440 --> 53:31.440]  The Rolling Stone geezer says, run by the government.
[53:31.440 --> 53:33.440]  Because he was in those meetings, folks,
[53:33.440 --> 53:34.440]  five, six years ago.
[53:34.440 --> 53:35.440]  They had a bunch of them.
[53:35.440 --> 53:37.440]  Where they told him, you'll still have a job.
[53:37.440 --> 53:38.440]  You'll still have sponsors.
[53:38.440 --> 53:42.440]  You'll still be successful once we shut all your competition down.
[53:42.440 --> 53:45.440]  And that's why this old loser,
[53:45.440 --> 53:46.440]  nothing against him that he's old,
[53:46.440 --> 53:49.440]  but I'm saying old ideas, failed systems.
[53:49.440 --> 53:51.440]  That's why he wants censorship,
[53:51.440 --> 53:53.440]  because nobody's reading Rolling Stone.
[53:53.440 --> 53:56.440]  It went from being a broad sheet to a little bitty thing,
[53:56.440 --> 53:58.440]  and now it's failing financially.
[53:58.440 --> 54:00.440]  It puts out fake articles about Ivermectin
[54:00.440 --> 54:02.440]  killing thousands in Oklahoma.
[54:02.440 --> 54:04.440]  It puts out fake articles about me
[54:04.440 --> 54:06.440]  calling for me to be taken out of the air.
[54:06.440 --> 54:07.440]  It's a joke.
[54:07.440 --> 54:11.440]  It's pro-establishment.
[54:11.440 --> 54:14.440]  I'm going to go to Alistair in Australia.
[54:14.440 --> 54:16.440]  Here in just a moment.
[54:16.440 --> 54:17.440]  Bannon pops in for 30 minutes,
[54:17.440 --> 54:19.440]  and I'll get to everybody that's patiently holding.
[54:19.440 --> 54:21.440]  D. Jordan, Greg, D.J., Greg,
[54:21.440 --> 54:24.440]  Mike, Carlos, Angela, Jason, and others.
[54:24.440 --> 54:27.440]  But first, we're not funded by George Soros and the Lord.
[54:27.440 --> 54:28.440]  We're funded by you.

[54:30.440 --> 54:32.440]  And right now, we've extended for three days.

[54:34.440 --> 54:36.440]  to midnight tomorrow on Emergency Fundraiser.
[54:36.440 --> 54:37.440]  A bunch of big special guests.
[54:37.440 --> 54:39.440]  Tune in and share the feed.
[54:39.440 --> 54:40.440]  It's a big event tomorrow.
[54:40.440 --> 54:42.440]  I'll tell you later in the day some of the big guests
[54:42.440 --> 54:45.440]  that are joining us, but it's a big lineup.
[54:45.440 --> 54:47.440]  Please go to m4warstore.com

[55:06.440 --> 55:09.440]  Your focus, your IQ, everything.
[55:09.440 --> 55:11.440]  There's a major run on iodine happening right now.
[55:11.440 --> 55:12.440]  It's all over the news.
[55:12.440 --> 55:14.440]  But despite that, we're keeping it at 50% off,

[56:12.440 --> 56:14.440]  Encourage others to get them while you still can.
[56:14.440 --> 56:16.440]  1776coin.com.
[56:16.440 --> 56:18.440]  All right, Alistair in Australia.
[56:18.440 --> 56:19.440]  First caller, thanks for calling.
[56:19.440 --> 56:21.440]  Go ahead.
[56:21.440 --> 56:22.440]  Hi, Alex.
[56:22.440 --> 56:23.440]  Can you hear me clear?
[56:23.440 --> 56:24.440]  I can, brother.
[56:24.440 --> 56:25.440]  Go ahead.
[56:25.440 --> 56:26.440]  Hi, yeah.
[56:26.440 --> 56:28.440]  Thanks for getting me to you quickly.
[56:28.440 --> 56:31.440]  It's four o'clock here in Melbourne, so it's late.
[56:31.440 --> 56:33.440]  And I understand your stress, Alex.
[56:33.440 --> 56:35.440]  I can see where the stress is coming from.
[56:35.440 --> 56:37.440]  I've been listening to your show for a long time
[56:37.440 --> 56:41.440]  and you bear a heavy burden, but you shrug it off impressively.
[56:41.440 --> 56:44.440]  Anyway, I just wanted to get to some of the things
[56:44.440 --> 56:46.440]  that's been going on in Melbourne,
[56:46.440 --> 56:49.440]  because this is the heartland of the Great Reset.
[56:49.440 --> 56:52.440]  I've actually ordered your book on the Great Reset,
[56:52.440 --> 56:55.440]  which I'm patiently waiting to arrive.
[56:55.440 --> 56:57.440]  But we had two years of lockdown here,
[56:57.440 --> 56:59.440]  and I was working at a supermarket,
[56:59.440 --> 57:02.440]  which was one of the only businesses that remained open.
[57:02.440 --> 57:06.440]  And I was there on the front lines watching toilet paper
[57:06.440 --> 57:10.440]  go off the shelves and people going crazy with masks.
[57:10.440 --> 57:12.440]  And you were dead on about everything.
[57:12.440 --> 57:14.440]  You lived through the beta test of martial law.
[57:14.440 --> 57:17.440]  Steve Bannon's in six minutes, but stay there.
[57:17.440 --> 57:18.440]  He's on it five after.
[57:18.440 --> 57:20.440]  I'm going to come right back to you, Alistair.
[57:20.440 --> 57:22.440]  I want to give you the floor to let people know,
[57:22.440 --> 57:24.440]  because when you said Melbourne is ground zero
[57:24.440 --> 57:27.440]  for the model of the world, Klaus Schwab admits it.
[57:27.440 --> 57:28.440]  You are the beta test.
[57:28.440 --> 57:31.440]  Australia today, the world tomorrow.
[57:31.440 --> 57:33.440]  Don't hang up, Alistair.
[57:33.440 --> 57:34.440]  I know it's four in the morning.
[57:34.440 --> 57:36.440]  Stay right there back in two minutes with Alistair.
[57:36.440 --> 57:38.440]  And then we'll have Bannon on for 25 minutes,
[57:38.440 --> 57:40.440]  and then your calls.
[57:40.440 --> 57:42.440]  We're taking a ton of your calls today.
[57:42.440 --> 57:44.440]  We'll take calls for at least an hour and a half after that.
[57:44.440 --> 57:46.440]  Can't wait to take your calls. They're amazing.
[57:46.440 --> 58:09.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[58:09.440 --> 58:31.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[58:31.440 --> 58:49.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[58:49.440 --> 59:02.440]  It's the bad halogen to the same family as chlorine bromide.
[59:02.440 --> 59:31.440]  It's the bad halogen to the same family as chlorine bromide.
[59:31.440 --> 1:00:00.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:29.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:31.440]  Go ahead, Alistair.
[1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:25.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:01:25.440 --> 1:01:54.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:01:54.440 --> 1:02:21.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:47.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:02:47.440 --> 1:03:13.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:39.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:03:39.440 --> 1:04:05.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:31.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:58.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:04:58.440 --> 1:05:24.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:05:24.440 --> 1:05:51.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:05:51.440 --> 1:06:18.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:06:18.440 --> 1:06:41.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:06:41.440 --> 1:07:08.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:07:08.440 --> 1:07:35.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:07:35.440 --> 1:08:02.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:08:02.440 --> 1:08:30.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:59.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:28.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:53.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:09:53.440 --> 1:10:22.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:52.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:10:53.440 --> 1:11:20.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:11:20.440 --> 1:11:49.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:11:50.440 --> 1:12:19.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:49.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:12:50.440 --> 1:13:18.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:47.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:13:48.440 --> 1:14:10.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:32.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:14:32.440 --> 1:14:58.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:14:58.440 --> 1:15:14.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:15:28.440 --> 1:15:56.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:15:56.440 --> 1:16:25.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:53.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:16:53.440 --> 1:17:19.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:48.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:17:49.440 --> 1:18:16.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:43.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:18:43.440 --> 1:19:07.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:34.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:19:34.440 --> 1:19:57.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:20:04.440 --> 1:20:30.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:56.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:20:56.440 --> 1:21:23.440]  Thank you, Alistair.

[1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:49.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:24:49.440 --> 1:25:16.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:25:16.440 --> 1:25:44.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:25:44.440 --> 1:26:12.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:41.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:26:42.440 --> 1:27:11.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:27:12.440 --> 1:27:40.440]  Thank you, Alistair.

[1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:56.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:37:57.440 --> 1:38:24.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:38:24.440 --> 1:38:53.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:38:54.440 --> 1:39:23.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:51.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:39:51.440 --> 1:40:20.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:40:21.440 --> 1:40:50.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:40:51.440 --> 1:41:20.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:50.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:41:51.440 --> 1:42:18.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:33.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:57.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:42:57.440 --> 1:43:24.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:43:24.440 --> 1:43:50.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:43:50.440 --> 1:44:17.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:44:17.440 --> 1:44:46.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:44:47.440 --> 1:45:14.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:43.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:45:44.440 --> 1:46:07.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:46:07.440 --> 1:46:34.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:58.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:11.440]  Thank you, Alistair.
[1:47:11.440 --> 1:47:30.440]  Welcome back to this Tuesday Live, October 11th Transmission. We're talking to DJ, then we're going to talk to Angela and others here in just a moment, but recap, you're in New York describing two years of lockdowns, what it's like, the illegal aliens by the tens of thousands being brought in, your mayor panicking.
[1:47:30.440 --> 1:47:46.440]  Let's play a clip of the new mayor of New York that just illustrates everything we are talking about. Here's Eric Adams' clip four on the illegal immigrant crisis. We have not asked for this. The Democrats literally, Biden said, surge the border, I'm elected.
[1:47:46.440 --> 1:47:57.440]  There was never any agreement to take on the job of supporting thousands of asylum seekers. What do you think the rest of the country does taking on millions a month? It's millions a month. Here it is.
[1:47:57.440 --> 1:48:18.440]  New Yorkers are angry. I am angry too. We have not asked for this. There was never any agreement to take on the job of supporting thousands of asylum seekers. This responsibility was simply handed to us without warning, as buses began showing up.
[1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:22.440]  There's no playbook for this. No precedent.
[1:48:22.440 --> 1:48:35.440]  No playbook? No precedent? Obama completely opened the border, had millions a month coming across. Trump basically shut it down 99%. Then Biden, before he even got elected, said, when I'm elected, immediately surge the border, you'll all be legalized.
[1:48:35.440 --> 1:48:44.440]  Millions and millions and millions and millions a month. And just in Texas alone. Not to mention Arizona and California, and other states on the border.
[1:48:44.440 --> 1:48:56.440]  There's no playbook. There's no precedent. You did this. Your party did this. In fact, guys, find the clip of Biden saying, if I get elected, immediately surge the border, because that clip doesn't get played enough.
[1:48:56.440 --> 1:49:03.440]  I tell family about that. They go, oh, he didn't really say that. Oh, they found the clip that fast. This crew is incredible. Here's the clip.
[1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:15.440]  What I would do as president is several more things, because things have changed. I would, in fact, make sure that there is, we immediately surge through the border. All those people are seeking asylum. They deserve to be heard.
[1:49:15.440 --> 1:49:29.440]  That's who we are. We're a nation that says, if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should come. I would change the order that the president just changed, saying women who were being beaten and abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum.
[1:49:29.440 --> 1:49:35.440]  Beaten and abused. They're getting beaten and abused now. So you just heard it.
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:45.440]  Maybe I should send this clip to the mayor of New York. There's no precedent. We didn't do this. No, you did do this. Your party did this, buddy boy.
[1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:53.440]  But they want us all censored so we can't point that out. DJ, I wanted to set that up for you. Tell us what's happening in New York. Go ahead.
[1:49:53.440 --> 1:50:08.440]  Well, you know, you got this problem of both the immigrants were migrants and you have the homeless that are made homeless. Many people, they can't afford the rent. The rent is so ridiculous here.
[1:50:08.440 --> 1:50:19.440]  What a conflict between the two and how disenfranchised the citizens have to feel when they're homeless and then other people are being put up in nice hotels and stuff.
[1:50:19.440 --> 1:50:29.440]  It's just absolutely crazy. And now we've got this witch for a governor that nobody elected. And I got to believe because we're in a blue state here.
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:37.440]  They're going to have an easier time of stealing the election and trying to ease out this Republican that a lot of people outside the city want to be the governor.
[1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:50.440]  Zeldin and it's neck and neck. I can't even see how it can be neck and neck with those two. But that's the other problem that we're facing because this governor doesn't want to save the state.
[1:50:50.440 --> 1:50:53.440]  And this candidate that wants to be governor is campaigning.
[1:50:53.440 --> 1:51:02.440]  Well, the communists want to drive stuff into collapse to make us capitulate. But as long as we blame them, it backfires on them. That's the key.
[1:51:02.440 --> 1:51:12.440]  Yeah, well, let me tell you something. There's so much stuff going on here. It boggles the mind. And a lot of it is in the outer boroughs, Alex, what we call the outer boroughs.
[1:51:12.440 --> 1:51:28.440]  In other words, not in Manhattan because a lot of the restrictions of the parking do not enable people to be in their cars and sleep in their cars and trailers, but out in Queens and in Brooklyn and the Bronx.
[1:51:28.440 --> 1:51:30.440]  It's a war zone.
[1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:35.440]  And you have the subways that I don't even go into anymore. There's just one.
[1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:43.440]  By the way, I've talked to people that are tough guys that have recently been to New York and they said the subways look like our episode of the Road Warrior.
[1:51:43.440 --> 1:51:50.440]  Hey, you met me. I'm six foot two. I'm a big guy and I'm capable. I know how to fight. I don't want to go down there.
[1:51:50.440 --> 1:51:54.440]  I don't want to I don't want to get shot or stabbed or just I don't even want to see it.
[1:51:54.440 --> 1:52:00.440]  It's so ugly what goes on down on the subways now every day. There's a lot of people say we'll just get a car in New York.
[1:52:00.440 --> 1:52:02.440]  Most people couldn't have a car.
[1:52:02.440 --> 1:52:13.440]  Yeah. Well, what they do is they go buy a beat up car or they get a trailer and they hook up the trailer to a vehicle and there are places that are unrestricted parking and you can go to.
[1:52:13.440 --> 1:52:17.440]  So how's it all going to end? What do you see happening?
[1:52:17.440 --> 1:52:34.440]  I think that the economic collapse nationwide is imminent. The market is so unstable and down that it's just going to take a little bit beyond this tipping point to bring it all the way down because the globalists control that.
[1:52:34.440 --> 1:52:40.440]  That's their piggy bank and they're going to pull the trigger on that when they want to and that may happen before the election as well.
[1:52:40.440 --> 1:52:46.440]  I think it'll happen after. Thank you so much for the call. Thank you, sir. Mike in Florida, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:52:46.440 --> 1:52:54.440]  OK, good to be on Alex. I appreciate all your stuff. I really feel like I feel like I'm the worst thing my family's life.
[1:52:54.440 --> 1:53:02.440]  So I wanted to talk about the Florida Surgeon General's vaccine study that he tweeted out and got canceled real quick.
[1:53:02.440 --> 1:53:20.440]  Yes, he's cool as hell, man. I'm glad to be a Florida resident. But so in the fine print of that study, they excluded four groups of people from that study. Anyone who had COVID died of COVID or got a booster or was after.
[1:53:20.440 --> 1:53:23.440]  That's right. Far worse than even his study. His study was very conservative.
[1:53:23.440 --> 1:53:33.440]  Right. Exactly. It shows such a small picture of what really is. So I feel like it would have freaked the whole world out and they would have called it a farce, you know, if they would have.
[1:53:33.440 --> 1:53:43.440]  Yeah, not just an 84% increase in heart attacks, men 13 to 38 or whatever. It's far worse, but he just had a very conservative study that the state could do.
[1:53:43.440 --> 1:53:50.440]  Yeah. And it's just really incredible. I mean, I just can't believe that this is like that people don't freak out over that.
[1:53:50.440 --> 1:53:53.440]  I mean, people percents a huge number in that age range.
[1:53:53.440 --> 1:53:59.440]  Man, they're killing us. And again, they knew it. Remember the October 2000 document from the CDC predicted it all.
[1:53:59.440 --> 1:54:09.440]  Yeah, but they sure did. They had been calling it since the beginning and I just, I literally can't thank them for worse enough for suggesting going to God and doing their own research.
[1:54:09.440 --> 1:54:18.440]  Brother, we're in this together. So thank you. Thank you, Mike. Let's go ahead and take another call. Who's up next? Carlos in Canada. Go ahead.
[1:54:18.440 --> 1:54:27.440]  Thank you, Alex. About 2000 years ago, Jesus of Nazareth in the temple flipped the money lenders tables over.
[1:54:27.440 --> 1:54:33.440]  This was not the sort of thing we expected Jesus of Nazareth to do, but he did.
[1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:36.440]  Only time Christ got violent was with the bankers.
[1:54:36.440 --> 1:54:43.440]  Right. And what did he say? Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and you don't belong here.
[1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:52.440]  They that the money lenders decided that they were going to run the world, Alex, we should have overturned their tables and we didn't.
[1:54:52.440 --> 1:54:57.440]  We haven't. And now we're paying the price. Essentially, the bottom line is that.
[1:54:57.440 --> 1:55:04.440]  Yeah, now PayPal says they're going to find you $2,500 for political views. We've given the bankers total control.
[1:55:04.440 --> 1:55:10.440]  That's right. And it's always through the financial control that they try to control you. Have you noticed?
[1:55:10.440 --> 1:55:17.440]  It's always financial control, either it's through law fair or financial control through firing you.
[1:55:17.440 --> 1:55:24.440]  And it incorporated into a body called corporation that became international.
[1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:32.440]  And if you listen carefully and decode Prince Charles comments to the World Economic Forum, he says today you guys,
[1:55:32.440 --> 1:55:38.440]  the 1000 corporations that are members of the World Economic Forum, you guys have more money than entire governments.
[1:55:38.440 --> 1:55:46.440]  You are now the government of the world and we have to defend that power with military order.
[1:55:46.440 --> 1:55:53.440]  Now, if we don't listen to that, we lose our liberty and essentially you bring down the individual,
[1:55:53.440 --> 1:56:02.440]  but eventually you have to bring down the constitutions that were forged through effort for 2000 years through wars and peace and
[1:56:02.440 --> 1:56:10.440]  treaties of Westphalia, etc. to get so that we have corporations to protect, to destroy our institutions.
[1:56:10.440 --> 1:56:18.440]  And that's what's next. It is the American constitution, the destruction of America that must take place for them to take over the world.
[1:56:18.440 --> 1:56:23.440]  And that's what it's all about. It's as simple as that. Now, do we want to go along with that? Do we want to?
[1:56:23.440 --> 1:56:28.440]  They're turning us into chattel slavery and saying we control your mind and you can't use money.
[1:56:28.440 --> 1:56:33.440]  We should all unify behind it. Isn't it good that people backlash against PayPal?
[1:56:33.440 --> 1:56:43.440]  Well, yes. And among other things, nobody wants to have to milk their insects in the morning because there's no milk to go with your breakfast
[1:56:43.440 --> 1:56:48.440]  and then eat those insects for lunch. I mean, this is a world that we simply do not want.
[1:56:48.440 --> 1:56:54.440]  So they're selling us a dystopia. Instead, we should reject the New World Order and everything that stands for it.
[1:56:54.440 --> 1:57:02.440]  Thank you, Carlos. All right, Angela, Alex, Jason, Frank, Jordan, son of Abraham, Tyson, Greg, David.
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:10.440]  The order, your calls came in. The next hour will be nothing but calls and some other breaking news we've got coming in.
[1:57:10.440 --> 1:57:17.440]  But it's all coming up next hour. And then I'm told Mike Adams has got, he's always got huge news.
[1:57:17.440 --> 1:57:20.440]  It's always world changing. It's always the most important you can hear.
[1:57:20.440 --> 1:57:27.440]  But Mike Adams has got big news in the fourth hour today. I head to the War Room with the great Owen Schreuer, 3 p.m. Central.
[1:57:27.440 --> 1:57:33.440]  Only way the transmission gets out is you taking the links at Band-Aid Video and infowars.com.com.
[1:57:33.440 --> 1:57:40.440]  slash show and sharing them. And of course, their sensor because it's truth and it's victory.
[1:57:40.440 --> 1:57:43.440]  We'll be right back with hour number three.
[1:57:43.440 --> 1:57:53.440]  It's our best seller. We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[1:57:53.440 --> 1:57:59.440]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made it feel and how healthy it made them,
[1:57:59.440 --> 1:58:05.440]  it has become our number one overall best seller. And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back at stock.
[1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:12.440]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[1:58:12.440 --> 1:58:18.440]  All the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[1:58:18.440 --> 1:58:25.440]  Essential means without these things you die. And so much of the food is debased. There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[1:58:25.440 --> 1:58:29.440]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[1:58:29.440 --> 1:58:36.440]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the very best and it's a low price and it funds the info war.
[1:58:36.440 --> 1:58:44.440]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock at infowarstore.com for a 50% off.
[1:58:44.440 --> 1:58:47.440]  Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[1:58:48.440 --> 1:59:00.440]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with a globalist. I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but to the world.
[1:59:00.440 --> 1:59:07.440]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit.
[1:59:07.440 --> 1:59:14.440]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support info wars are the real reason we've had the success.
[1:59:14.440 --> 1:59:19.440]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had.
[1:59:19.440 --> 1:59:29.440]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[1:59:29.440 --> 1:59:33.440]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify it.
[1:59:33.440 --> 1:59:42.440]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now, because we are over the target and history is happening.
[1:59:42.440 --> 1:59:59.440]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[1:59:59.440 --> 2:00:05.440]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:05.440 --> 2:00:17.440]  Well, we're getting a lot of great perspectives and angles that I wouldn't have thought of taking these incredible callers, and we're taking them again right now throughout this hour on this live Tuesday broadcast.
[2:00:17.440 --> 2:00:21.440]  Angela in Wisconsin, go ahead, you're on the air.
[2:00:21.440 --> 2:00:28.440]  Good afternoon, Alex. Thank you so much for taking my call, and thank you for your stand for America.
[2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:31.440]  You truly are the paul of the year of our day and time.
[2:00:31.440 --> 2:00:48.440]  My goodness, Alex, if they hadn't of usurped our prefeat and by listening to your show, I realize now through, you know, the last couple of few years that they never would have gotten away with all this.
[2:00:48.440 --> 2:00:53.440]  And if it wasn't for your show, they would have gotten away with a lot more and we'd probably all be slaves.
[2:00:53.440 --> 2:00:54.440]  It wasn't for you.
[2:00:54.440 --> 2:01:04.440]  I want to be clear, I don't just give you guys credit on the head, it's the audience they're scared of, it's your activism, you're spreading the word, that's why they fear the show.
[2:01:04.440 --> 2:01:11.440]  So that's when you give me credit, I'm just like you, we're all in this together, but it's you guys they fear, so thank you.
[2:01:11.440 --> 2:01:23.440]  You're welcome, but let's face it, I don't have the education and all your contributors, the schooling, the training they went through, I have to commend them for that because I never did that.
[2:01:23.440 --> 2:01:24.440]  I appreciate it.
[2:01:24.440 --> 2:01:27.440]  And it's finally being put to good use.
[2:01:27.440 --> 2:01:36.440]  In this case, saving our country from our countrymen, us good people from World War III, them getting away with us.
[2:01:36.440 --> 2:01:47.440]  We're going to get the victory and finally we'll be able to end the corruption and go forward without all this corrupted up the heck of our constitutional rights.
[2:01:47.440 --> 2:01:50.440]  We can put it back on track the way it should be.
[2:01:50.440 --> 2:02:03.440]  Oh, so anyway, I did call about one thing, but in light of your being so overloaded and overwhelmed, I just wanted to give you personally one thing from my heart to you.
[2:02:03.440 --> 2:02:08.440]  Some people take vitamins and you said you get quiet sometimes.
[2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:19.440]  I do that too, but I listened to this song at the beginning of all this and I was listening to you and I was listening to that and I got back to my roots in biblical research ministry that's been around for 80 years.
[2:02:19.440 --> 2:02:21.440]  They don't have a crystal palace.
[2:02:21.440 --> 2:02:25.440]  They're out of Ohio, been around for 80 years now.
[2:02:25.440 --> 2:02:27.440]  And it's the way out of work.
[2:02:27.440 --> 2:02:34.440]  They've got stuff there that might, it would just, if nothing else, it'll just make you feel good that there's more people out there that are doing their part.
[2:02:34.440 --> 2:02:38.440]  Well, it's definitely real Christians are the main opposition of the New World Order.
[2:02:38.440 --> 2:02:48.440]  And so anyway, but there's this song when I was in my 20s and I first got introduced to this ministry, I went to a function and I heard this group play and their song is still available.
[2:02:48.440 --> 2:02:51.440]  It's called Accidentally.
[2:02:51.440 --> 2:02:56.440]  You go to YouTube, you got to type in Accidentally by Good Seed Band.
[2:02:56.440 --> 2:02:59.440]  And it's so old, Alex, but guess what?
[2:02:59.440 --> 2:03:04.440]  It's on a TV show years and years ago.
[2:03:04.440 --> 2:03:05.440]  That's my hope.
[2:03:05.440 --> 2:03:12.440]  Not only was this song, but what it does for me is sometimes I'm overloaded or I call it overwhelmed.
[2:03:12.440 --> 2:03:15.440]  I'll just get, you know, as peaceful as I can.
[2:03:15.440 --> 2:03:20.440]  You say Accidentally, Accidentally by the Good Seed Band.
[2:03:20.440 --> 2:03:21.440]  I appreciate your call.
[2:03:21.440 --> 2:03:22.440]  You're beautiful.
[2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:23.440]  We love you.
[2:03:23.440 --> 2:03:24.440]  We're the next person.
[2:03:24.440 --> 2:03:25.440]  Look it up, folks.
[2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:26.440]  Thanks.
[2:03:26.440 --> 2:03:27.440]  Jason in Texas.
[2:03:27.440 --> 2:03:28.440]  Go ahead.
[2:03:28.440 --> 2:03:29.440]  Yeah, Alex.
[2:03:29.440 --> 2:03:33.440]  I said the election is not going to happen.
[2:03:33.440 --> 2:03:39.440]  I mean, I don't want to be, as you always say, you know, doom and gloom, but that's their only hope now.
[2:03:39.440 --> 2:03:41.440]  They know they're going to get smoked at this election.
[2:03:41.440 --> 2:03:46.440]  And they're going to come up with some, you know, like the power or something.
[2:03:46.440 --> 2:03:48.440]  But I think it's just going to be a duke's strike.
[2:03:48.440 --> 2:03:56.440]  Because if you go back, just like you played earlier without Obama and Soros, you know, how they say things and they happen.
[2:03:56.440 --> 2:03:59.440]  Well, I brought this up two years ago.
[2:03:59.440 --> 2:04:00.440]  Bring it up again.
[2:04:00.440 --> 2:04:05.440]  Eric Saul, well, when he says we need to start nuking our own cities and states, mostly red states.
[2:04:05.440 --> 2:04:06.440]  He tweeted.
[2:04:06.440 --> 2:04:08.440]  He said we should start nuking Republicans.
[2:04:08.440 --> 2:04:09.440]  Yeah.
[2:04:09.440 --> 2:04:11.440]  And there's your foreshadowing right there.
[2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:18.440]  So they'll probably like blow up a Midwestern town like Omaha or something or Oklahoma City and blame it on us.
[2:04:18.440 --> 2:04:19.440]  Yep.
[2:04:19.440 --> 2:04:24.440]  Well, no, they're going to, they're the ones doing it, but they're going to blame China, Russia, some crap like that.
[2:04:24.440 --> 2:04:29.440]  And then all we got to go to war, they will suspend the election, which they can and have the power to.
[2:04:29.440 --> 2:04:30.440]  And that's going to be it.
[2:04:30.440 --> 2:04:33.440]  So, but yeah, I don't know.
[2:04:33.440 --> 2:04:35.440]  Pray to somebody and we need help.
[2:04:35.440 --> 2:04:41.440]  Bad, but I think the last man said we need to go on the offensive because we can't sit back and take this no more.
[2:04:41.440 --> 2:04:44.440]  And we need people like Tucker Carlson, you everybody.
[2:04:44.440 --> 2:04:48.440]  Jason, I want to come right back to you in 60 seconds.
[2:04:48.440 --> 2:04:49.440]  We'll be right back.
[2:04:49.440 --> 2:04:50.440]  Stay with us.
[2:04:50.440 --> 2:04:51.440]  I want to play a Tulsi Gabbard's clip again.
[2:04:51.440 --> 2:04:53.440]  It's so powerful in World War three.
[2:04:53.440 --> 2:04:54.440]  We'll go right back to Jason.
[2:04:54.440 --> 2:04:55.440]  Stay with us.
[2:04:58.440 --> 2:05:00.440]  It's our best seller.
[2:05:00.440 --> 2:05:04.440]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[2:05:04.440 --> 2:05:10.440]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them,
[2:05:10.440 --> 2:05:13.440]  it has become our number one overall best seller.
[2:05:13.440 --> 2:05:16.440]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back at stock.
[2:05:16.440 --> 2:05:22.440]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[2:05:22.440 --> 2:05:29.440]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[2:05:29.440 --> 2:05:34.440]  Essential means without these things, you die and so much of the food is debased.
[2:05:34.440 --> 2:05:36.440]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[2:05:36.440 --> 2:05:40.440]  It is critical to bolster our bodies defenses with a product like this.
[2:05:40.440 --> 2:05:47.440]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the very best and it's a low price and it funds the info work.
[2:05:47.440 --> 2:05:55.440]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock at infoworkstore.com for 50% off.
[2:05:55.440 --> 2:05:59.440]  Vitamin mineral fusion back at stock infoworkstore.com.
[2:05:59.440 --> 2:06:26.440]  I can no longer remain in today's Democratic Party that's under the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers
[2:06:26.440 --> 2:06:34.440]  who are driven by cowardly wokeness, who divide us by racializing every issue and stoking anti-white racism,
[2:06:34.440 --> 2:06:40.440]  who actively work to undermine our God-given freedoms that are enshrined in our Constitution,
[2:06:40.440 --> 2:06:44.440]  who are hostile to people of faith and spirituality,
[2:06:44.440 --> 2:06:49.440]  who demonize the police but protect criminals at the expense of law-abiding Americans,
[2:06:49.440 --> 2:06:56.440]  who believe in open borders, who weaponize the national security state to go after their political opponents,
[2:06:56.440 --> 2:07:01.440]  and above all, who are dragging us ever closer to nuclear war.
[2:07:01.440 --> 2:07:08.440]  Now, I believe in a government that's of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[2:07:08.440 --> 2:07:11.440]  Unfortunately, today's Democratic Party does not.
[2:07:11.440 --> 2:07:18.440]  Instead, it stands for a government that is of, by, and for the powerful elite.
[2:07:18.440 --> 2:07:26.440]  Now, I'm calling on my fellow common sense independent-minded Democrats to join me in leaving the Democratic Party.
[2:07:26.440 --> 2:07:34.440]  If you can no longer stomach the direction that the so-called woke Democratic Party ideologues are taking our country,
[2:07:34.440 --> 2:07:36.440]  then I invite you to join me.
[2:07:38.440 --> 2:07:42.440]  People are waking up. Jason in Texas got cut off at the break.
[2:07:42.440 --> 2:07:48.440]  Some states just joined us, recap what you were saying about believing they're going to stage a false flag ahead of the elections
[2:07:48.440 --> 2:07:53.440]  and try to suspend the elections. I think that's a real possibility of what we've seen.
[2:07:53.440 --> 2:08:00.440]  We've seen the pre-programming, cyber attack, white supremacy attack, chemical-biological attack, nuclear attack.
[2:08:00.440 --> 2:08:05.440]  I think it's all in the cards right now in the next 28 days. Your view on that, Jason.
[2:08:05.440 --> 2:08:12.440]  Again, that's all they have. They know they're going to lose this election, and that's all they have.
[2:08:12.440 --> 2:08:19.440]  I can say is, yeah, they're going to use that. They can suspend the election during wartime, which we all know that,
[2:08:19.440 --> 2:08:25.440]  and that's their only play. And with this whole toasting everything, they just wrote her off already.
[2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:31.440]  I just read the article on Gateway Pundit, all main Democrat media and all that, or are you calling her?
[2:08:31.440 --> 2:08:37.440]  She was a Republican anyways, and this and that, so they just get rid of her.
[2:08:37.440 --> 2:08:43.440]  And then they're speeding up the whole inflation and all that. The gas is soaring, food's soaring.
[2:08:43.440 --> 2:08:50.440]  People are going to start stealing from the stores, wiping out the stores, and big old riots and fights over food.
[2:08:50.440 --> 2:08:56.440]  And my concern is they're going to do it, even if the Republicans get in, they've got a bunch of neocons at the top.
[2:08:56.440 --> 2:09:01.440]  We've got to contend with good people, but they're going to blame Republicans for the collapse that they've instituted.
[2:09:01.440 --> 2:09:05.440]  Absolutely. So get prepared, everyone.
[2:09:05.440 --> 2:09:12.440]  Thank you, Jason. Everybody should get ready now. All right, more calls. Jordan in New Jersey. Jordan, you're on the air. Thanks for calling.
[2:09:12.440 --> 2:09:15.440]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[2:09:15.440 --> 2:09:28.440]  Jordan here of the www.coronais.com. I just want to issue a warning. I saw Tom Ren's on your program yesterday. I understand the big loss he's going through.
[2:09:28.440 --> 2:09:37.440]  And I just want to, I believe that this is not only a bio weapon, these forced injections or close to force that will be forced in the future.
[2:09:37.440 --> 2:09:42.440]  We're dealing with something that is what you always describe as a binary weapon.
[2:09:42.440 --> 2:09:52.440]  So it's kill and control. And I just want to first issue a warning to you and Mr. Ren's and others in the community that this is more than it appears.
[2:09:52.440 --> 2:09:59.440]  People are dying in huge numbers, but there's people that are living through this injection and they're not just cold shots, as you call them.
[2:09:59.440 --> 2:10:04.440]  There are people that are actually the technology that's inserted into these are taking in folks.
[2:10:04.440 --> 2:10:17.440]  And so I think that the injections and the public emergency for the health public emergency is everything we should be fighting right now because they can do anything right now and declare.
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:22.440]  Oh, you're right. And they're planning to bring it back. They're planning to bring this tyranny back.
[2:10:22.440 --> 2:10:29.440]  And they can suspend elections at will. And the two events that need to be overturned for once and for all.
[2:10:29.440 --> 2:10:36.440]  And one of these are your primary genesis of you, Alex, is 9-11, which the war on terror has never been declared over.
[2:10:36.440 --> 2:10:42.440]  And this health emergency, which will be what they can utilize immediately to call off elections.
[2:10:42.440 --> 2:10:48.440]  Now, I know you have a Mike Adams on later. I've done a lot of research and you've got to really have me on the show sometime.
[2:10:48.440 --> 2:10:55.440]  But what Mike Adams discovered are not blood clots. They are called organoids and or 3D cyborg tissue.
[2:10:55.440 --> 2:11:00.440]  And this is why Charles Lieber comes involved. And I'm saying that the element of that whole release...
[2:11:00.440 --> 2:11:04.440]  Yeah, they're implanting us with the electrochemical plugs in our body.
[2:11:04.440 --> 2:11:10.440]  And I'm just saying, so that's part of what this is. Some people die and I think they even targeted.
[2:11:10.440 --> 2:11:17.440]  You look at Steve Kerch's research about the lot numbers. They probably put some bad stuff in these registers.
[2:11:17.440 --> 2:11:21.440]  No, you're right. It's a mass experiment. It's been determined. Some people into cyborgs, others to kills.
[2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:31.440]  I'm just saying, so we have to be careful of that. Now, we need to have verification of Dr. Pablo Canberra's results that he did with optical microscopy.
[2:11:31.440 --> 2:11:40.440]  Okay, for the fifth column. There needs to be a seizure of these lots and there has to be a serious, assiduous study of all these injections now.
[2:11:40.440 --> 2:11:46.440]  No, I hear you and I appreciate your call. Great points, Jordan. Greg in Utah, you're on the air.
[2:11:46.440 --> 2:11:58.440]  Yeah, thank you, Alex. I'm kind of sticking my neck out there. I don't know of anybody besides you that understands this because of the nature of what I'm about to tell you.
[2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:15.440]  But I came up with the discovery on water. I sent John a clip and what happened was I basically had a salt water well and I wasn't going to give up my homestead
[2:12:15.440 --> 2:12:23.440]  because I found salt water. And through some prayer and some research, I discovered something huge.
[2:12:23.440 --> 2:12:31.440]  Now, I'm not taking this to the university. I'm not taking it to a professor. I'm bringing it to the people who need it.
[2:12:31.440 --> 2:12:38.440]  But I came up with something I'm calling the flat top solar steel. It operates off the sun.
[2:12:38.440 --> 2:12:47.440]  It has a constant flow of water coming out from any water source. Salt water, black water, it doesn't matter.
[2:12:47.440 --> 2:12:51.440]  I'm writing a small book on it and I'd like to offer you author's copy.
[2:12:51.440 --> 2:12:56.440]  This is above my pay grade. Are you saying you have a free energy machine or what are you saying about water?
[2:12:56.440 --> 2:13:02.440]  No, no. It's simple. I just went to the hardware store and this is an instruction manual on how to build one yourself.
[2:13:02.440 --> 2:13:09.440]  It's nobody thought outside the box. Okay, what is it? Talk to me like I'm five years old.
[2:13:09.440 --> 2:13:18.440]  Okay, it's a solar steel. Basically, the water inside it boils because of the design that they've had for thousands of years.
[2:13:18.440 --> 2:13:24.440]  They've never been able to make this big. They didn't think of water as a vapor, as a gas that wants to fill up space.
[2:13:24.440 --> 2:13:33.440]  Because I realized that, I had a dream one night and I can collect every drop. In fact, I've got a condenser in there,
[2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:41.440]  so I've got unlimited collection surfaces and as fast as that water is boiling with just a few to three PV panels,
[2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:45.440]  I've got a constant purified water coming out of it.
[2:13:45.440 --> 2:13:49.440]  All right, send me an email about it. Very interesting. I appreciate your call, Greg.
[2:13:49.440 --> 2:13:52.440]  Let's talk to Alex in Florida. Alex, you're on the air.
[2:13:52.440 --> 2:13:56.440]  Hey, Mr. Jones, thank you for taking my call and please forgive me. I'm getting over a little bronchitis,
[2:13:56.440 --> 2:14:00.440]  so my voice might be a little weak. I hope you can hear me okay.
[2:14:00.440 --> 2:14:06.440]  I wanted to just get my two cents. I'm here in Florida and I just wanted to explain what I've been seeing with everybody
[2:14:06.440 --> 2:14:12.440]  that I know that took the shot. As soon as my cousin and my dad took it, a month later, they were in the hospital
[2:14:12.440 --> 2:14:19.440]  for lower back issues, turned out disc and spinal cord issues. I talked to a young lady the other day, 22 years old.
[2:14:19.440 --> 2:14:25.440]  She went and took it, didn't get her period for nine months, and I have a co-worker who's literally over the past few weeks
[2:14:25.440 --> 2:14:31.440]  in and out of the doctor's office. Oh, they're saying now I have rare blood issues, but they're going to get to the bottom of it
[2:14:31.440 --> 2:14:37.440]  and nobody knows what it is but comes back three days later. Oh, they said now it's a heart issue
[2:14:37.440 --> 2:14:42.440]  and they think I have a rare heart disease, but they've never seen it before, but they're going to get to the bottom of it.
[2:14:42.440 --> 2:14:44.440]  It comes back three days later.
[2:14:44.440 --> 2:14:50.440]  Stacks of news articles, record artifacts, and teenagers, you name it, they have killed us.
[2:14:50.440 --> 2:14:54.440]  Oh, well, it's crazy because she comes back three days later and the doctors are like, oh, we figured it out.
[2:14:54.440 --> 2:15:01.440]  You have an autoimmune disease now and I'm like, oh my gosh, you poor girl. You took two shots, nobody's linking it to it.
[2:15:01.440 --> 2:15:08.440]  Doctors won't say a damn thing and I'm like, okay, well, either they're incompetent or they're told not to or they're incentivized not to.
[2:15:08.440 --> 2:15:14.440]  Either way, I'm so happy the spiritual general came out and said what he said because now everybody's going to wake up
[2:15:14.440 --> 2:15:18.440]  and now there's all these articles normalizing and old video games cause heart attacks.
[2:15:18.440 --> 2:15:22.440]  It's normal. Kids are suddenly going to have heart attacks. It's so sick.
[2:15:22.440 --> 2:15:28.440]  Well, yeah, and I want to give it to the one in my aunt. She went and took it and she was a God-fearing black,
[2:15:28.440 --> 2:15:31.440]  black New Orleans woman, you know.
[2:15:31.440 --> 2:15:34.440]  Stay there, Alex. Don't hang up. I want to hear what happened to your family.
[2:15:34.440 --> 2:15:40.440]  When we come back and then Frank, Vaughn, son of Abraham, Tyson, David, David Russell, Polly were taking the calls.
[2:15:40.440 --> 2:15:43.440]  The order they are received.
[2:15:43.440 --> 2:15:47.440]  Don't hear this type of information anywhere else.
[2:15:47.440 --> 2:15:56.440]  The people directly jacked into millions of their listeners. This is what the New World Order fears will be right back.
[2:15:56.440 --> 2:16:03.440]  Look around you. Everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents from their own admissions is now happening.
[2:16:03.440 --> 2:16:07.440]  Info wars credibility. My credibility has never been higher.
[2:16:07.440 --> 2:16:16.440]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air.
[2:16:16.440 --> 2:16:22.440]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[2:16:22.440 --> 2:16:26.440]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[2:16:26.440 --> 2:16:33.440]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees.
[2:16:33.440 --> 2:16:37.440]  And I can't fund those myself. It's unsustainable.
[2:16:37.440 --> 2:16:49.440]  So please visit save info wars dot com save info wars dot com where you can make straight donations, five, 10, $500, whatever you can so that I can continue to persevere.
[2:16:49.440 --> 2:16:52.440]  I'll never give up. I'll never give in, but I could give out.

[2:21:24.440 --> 2:21:36.440]  Wow, fake news, Washington Post outdoes itself, finally reports on pregnancy complications during COVID but can't quite pin into the mandatory experimental shot.
[2:21:36.440 --> 2:21:48.440]  Even though the New England Journal of Medicine found almost two years ago an 80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first and second trimesters.
[2:21:48.440 --> 2:21:50.440]  You see this folder?
[2:21:50.440 --> 2:21:52.440]  That's COVID camps.
[2:21:52.440 --> 2:21:55.440]  The latest info on it, I'm ready to do a whole show on it.
[2:21:55.440 --> 2:21:56.440]  Probably tomorrow.
[2:21:56.440 --> 2:21:58.440]  We've got a lot of video clips and more.
[2:21:58.440 --> 2:22:02.440]  Probably tomorrow, not it'll be Thursday, probably Wednesday.
[2:22:02.440 --> 2:22:04.440]  But right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[2:22:04.440 --> 2:22:06.440]  Alex, start over with what happened to your family.
[2:22:06.440 --> 2:22:08.440]  Go ahead.
[2:22:08.440 --> 2:22:15.440]  So my aunt, she a year ago around Christmas time, a little before that she went and took the shots and I had tried talking to her,
[2:22:15.440 --> 2:22:22.440]  warning her and she was a very strong, healthy, Godfrey Christian woman, black is black from New Orleans.
[2:22:22.440 --> 2:22:27.440]  And now nine months later, in and out of the hospitals and she has cancer.
[2:22:27.440 --> 2:22:30.440]  And it just breaks my heart because these are my coworkers.
[2:22:30.440 --> 2:22:31.440]  These are my friends.
[2:22:31.440 --> 2:22:32.440]  Brother, I'm so sorry to hear that.
[2:22:32.440 --> 2:22:35.440]  Has she figured out the causal effect?
[2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:37.440]  No, honestly, she's just put her faith in God.
[2:22:37.440 --> 2:22:39.440]  And at that point I let her rest there.
[2:22:39.440 --> 2:22:42.440]  You know, at the end of the day, I don't want to cause any further fear.
[2:22:42.440 --> 2:22:45.440]  I just find the light and, you know, spread the love.
[2:22:45.440 --> 2:22:50.440]  I'm not your doctor, but a lot of studies show the crystals are growing in her.
[2:22:50.440 --> 2:22:52.440]  The spike protein.
[2:22:52.440 --> 2:22:55.440]  If she gets Ivermectin, it might help her.
[2:22:55.440 --> 2:22:57.440]  Well, I do try to help as many as I can.
[2:22:57.440 --> 2:23:00.440]  I recommend all the remedies and I do a lot of research for detoxing it.
[2:23:00.440 --> 2:23:04.440]  So Lord knows I'll pass that along to her because I actually have some Ivermectin.
[2:23:04.440 --> 2:23:05.440]  Thanks to you.
[2:23:05.440 --> 2:23:07.440]  So thank you so much.
[2:23:07.440 --> 2:23:09.440]  Brother, I'm sorry to hear that's happening.
[2:23:09.440 --> 2:23:11.440]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[2:23:11.440 --> 2:23:12.440]  No, sir.
[2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:16.440]  I just wanted to give you my two cents of what I'm seeing on the ground with what the shots are really doing,
[2:23:16.440 --> 2:23:18.440]  even though, of course, they're not recording it.
[2:23:18.440 --> 2:23:23.440]  So thank goodness for the Surgeon General Florida because now that's going to speedball everything to come out even further.
[2:23:23.440 --> 2:23:26.440]  And I hope people wake up and just protect more innocent lives.
[2:23:26.440 --> 2:23:27.440]  Absolutely.
[2:23:27.440 --> 2:23:28.440]  We're fighting back.
[2:23:28.440 --> 2:23:29.440]  That's the good news.
[2:23:29.440 --> 2:23:30.440]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:23:30.440 --> 2:23:31.440]  Frank in Chicago.
[2:23:31.440 --> 2:23:32.440]  Go ahead.
[2:23:32.440 --> 2:23:33.440]  Hey, bud.
[2:23:33.440 --> 2:23:35.440]  How are you?
[2:23:35.440 --> 2:23:38.440]  We have the blueprint of what's going to happen.
[2:23:38.440 --> 2:23:40.440]  Book of Revelation.
[2:23:40.440 --> 2:23:45.440]  You know, America needs to collapse in order for this agenda to come through.
[2:23:45.440 --> 2:23:50.440]  I believe it's going to happen through the banking system and then through the Internet.
[2:23:50.440 --> 2:23:55.440]  And that's how they can control you with basically the mark of the beast.
[2:23:55.440 --> 2:23:57.440]  And the beast system is already being laid out.
[2:23:57.440 --> 2:24:02.440]  I mean, if you look at what's happening in Israel, they've received five red heifers.
[2:24:02.440 --> 2:24:08.440]  The last there's been nine red heifers that have been for sacrifice the last.
[2:24:08.440 --> 2:24:15.440]  And when the tenth red heifer is sacrificed, the third temple will be built.
[2:24:15.440 --> 2:24:23.440]  And that's one of the last sign of Jesus' return because the Antichrist is going to set up in the temple and declare himself God.
[2:24:23.440 --> 2:24:27.440]  So I think everybody's missing what's happening here.
[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:29.440]  We can't change what's going to happen.
[2:24:29.440 --> 2:24:30.440]  It's been written down.
[2:24:30.440 --> 2:24:38.440]  And the only way to beat what's happening is to repent and turn to Jesus and he's your only savior.
[2:24:38.440 --> 2:24:39.440]  That's it.
[2:24:39.440 --> 2:24:45.440]  We're the last generation and we're going to see this all come to pass.
[2:24:45.440 --> 2:24:46.440]  Brother, I hear you.
[2:24:46.440 --> 2:24:47.440]  We're in biblical times.
[2:24:47.440 --> 2:24:48.440]  Thank you.
[2:24:48.440 --> 2:24:50.440]  Son of Abraham calling from Texas.
[2:24:50.440 --> 2:24:52.440]  You're on the air.
[2:24:52.440 --> 2:24:53.440]  Yes.
[2:24:53.440 --> 2:24:54.440]  Can you hear me on this?
[2:24:54.440 --> 2:24:55.440]  I can, brother.
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:24:56.440]  Go ahead.
[2:24:56.440 --> 2:25:10.440]  I want to make a quick plug. Some of the products I got, the Prostagar brain force, plus bodies, living defense, eye curing, phisomagnetism, knockout, X3, X2, vasobites, supermail, and winter sun and ultra 12.
[2:25:10.440 --> 2:25:12.440]  Just want to plug those in really quick.
[2:25:12.440 --> 2:25:13.440]  Yeah.
[2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:23.440]  I wanted to touch on something that a lot of people haven't really, I guess, been talking about, which is the Ebola outbreak that has just occurred in the Sudan and how that could also pose a threat.
[2:25:23.440 --> 2:25:29.440]  It says that it takes about two days to three weeks after exposure for symptoms to appear.
[2:25:29.440 --> 2:25:34.440]  So one of those things that aren't being discussed right now, I just wanted to bring attention to that.
[2:25:34.440 --> 2:25:36.440]  Don, how'd you erase that?
[2:25:36.440 --> 2:25:41.440]  Because we know the globalists were heavily involved in the last big Ebola outbreak.
[2:25:41.440 --> 2:25:42.440]  Yeah.
[2:25:42.440 --> 2:25:47.440]  Actually, I had just like Bill Gates that said they were going to release their deadlier bioweapons.
[2:25:47.440 --> 2:25:52.440]  And so I just want to go ahead and bring that to the viewers' attention.
[2:25:52.440 --> 2:25:54.440]  Anything else, son of Abraham?
[2:25:54.440 --> 2:25:55.440]  That's going to be all, man.
[2:25:55.440 --> 2:25:56.440]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[2:25:56.440 --> 2:25:57.440]  God bless you.
[2:25:57.440 --> 2:25:58.440]  Appreciate everything you do.
[2:25:58.440 --> 2:25:59.440]  Thank you.
[2:25:59.440 --> 2:26:01.440]  Tyson and Kansas, go ahead.
[2:26:01.440 --> 2:26:03.440]  Hi, Alex.
[2:26:03.440 --> 2:26:16.440]  I just wanted to bring up something that I haven't mentioned as much lately, but the other day I was tuned into my U.S.
[2:26:16.440 --> 2:26:22.440]  Representative's live stream, Senator Roger Marshall from Kansas.
[2:26:22.440 --> 2:26:26.440]  And somebody posed the question on the live stream.
[2:26:26.440 --> 2:26:32.440]  They said, you know, Roger Marshall, what are we going to do about the fentanyl being smuggled across the border?
[2:26:32.440 --> 2:26:35.440]  And his reaction was, yes, we're working on it.
[2:26:35.440 --> 2:26:54.440]  Currently, legislation, U.S. legislation is working on some bills that are going to basically allow local law enforcement to work with social media platforms to hand over information from direct message
[2:26:54.440 --> 2:26:58.440]  and private messages to try to get ahead on that.
[2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:05.440]  And, you know, it just really- Yeah, so you're going to do a process instead of sanctioning China and shutting down the border?
[2:27:05.440 --> 2:27:06.440]  That's right.
[2:27:06.440 --> 2:27:19.440]  And it really, like, in my mind, it connects pretty well with the PayPal surveillance that, you know, they basically have already admitted almost seeming like a distraction.
[2:27:19.440 --> 2:27:29.440]  You know, I guess we don't want any- You don't want immigrants coming across the border, but I just kind of want to give out that buyer beware disclaimer that
[2:27:29.440 --> 2:27:35.440]  I think that some of these immigration policies that are coming to the forefront are kind of a ruse.
[2:27:35.440 --> 2:27:36.440]  Oh, yeah.
[2:27:36.440 --> 2:27:37.440]  And whaling and dialectic.
[2:27:37.440 --> 2:27:38.440]  Yeah.
[2:27:38.440 --> 2:27:39.440]  Create the problem off of the solution.
[2:27:39.440 --> 2:27:40.440]  I totally agree.
[2:27:40.440 --> 2:27:41.440]  Absolutely.
[2:27:41.440 --> 2:27:45.440]  We don't need to get rid of our bill of rights and constitution to protect ourselves.
[2:27:45.440 --> 2:27:48.440]  We need to keep it and make them enforce the law.
[2:27:48.440 --> 2:27:49.440]  Absolutely.
[2:27:49.440 --> 2:27:50.440]  I totally agree.
[2:27:50.440 --> 2:27:57.440]  And then real quick, I guess I can bring up Elon Musk buying out Twitter.
[2:27:57.440 --> 2:28:09.440]  You know, I think I'm not sure if he's, you know, obviously, if he goes through with the things that he says and making everything free for everybody to communicate, that would be great.
[2:28:09.440 --> 2:28:26.440]  But at the same time, you know, with the NeuroLink, you know, and the transhumanist agenda that he's basically pushing himself, it makes me think about is he in direct competition with Mark Zuckerberg in the metaverse?
[2:28:26.440 --> 2:28:27.440]  Exactly.
[2:28:27.440 --> 2:28:29.440]  He says a lot of good things.
[2:28:29.440 --> 2:28:30.440]  He does a lot of bad things.
[2:28:30.440 --> 2:28:32.440]  I support him in the good stuff he does.
[2:28:32.440 --> 2:28:33.440]  I don't support him in the bad stuff.
[2:28:33.440 --> 2:28:34.440]  Thank you so much.
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:35.440]  Amazing points, Tyson.
[2:28:35.440 --> 2:28:36.440]  All right.
[2:28:36.440 --> 2:28:37.440]  We're going to come back.
[2:28:37.440 --> 2:28:41.440]  We got a caller, that caller from Brazil just hung up.
[2:28:41.440 --> 2:28:42.440]  I was about to go to them.
[2:28:42.440 --> 2:28:43.440]  Oh, no, no.
[2:28:43.440 --> 2:28:46.440]  David's up next from Brazil, then David in Texas and others.
[2:28:46.440 --> 2:28:48.440]  David, Brazil, stay there.
[2:28:48.440 --> 2:28:56.440]  We're going to talk to the land of Bolsonaro straight ahead when we come back.
[2:28:56.440 --> 2:28:58.440]  It's our best seller.
[2:28:58.440 --> 2:29:02.440]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[2:29:02.440 --> 2:29:07.440]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel
[2:29:07.440 --> 2:29:11.440]  and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[2:29:11.440 --> 2:29:14.440]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[2:29:14.440 --> 2:29:20.440]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[2:29:20.440 --> 2:29:21.440]  function of the body.
[2:29:21.440 --> 2:29:26.440]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[2:29:26.440 --> 2:29:28.440]  need to live and be healthy.
[2:29:28.440 --> 2:29:30.440]  Essential means without these things, you die.
[2:29:30.440 --> 2:29:32.440]  And so much of the food is debased.
[2:29:32.440 --> 2:29:34.440]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[2:29:34.440 --> 2:29:38.440]  It is critical to bolster our body defenses with a product like this.
[2:29:38.440 --> 2:29:42.440]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the
[2:29:42.440 --> 2:29:45.440]  very best and it's a low price and it funds the InfoWare.
[2:29:45.440 --> 2:29:50.440]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally
[2:29:50.440 --> 2:29:53.440]  back in stock at InfoWareStore.com for a 50% off.

[2:33:28.440 --> 2:33:37.440]  So, real, raw people are calling into the broadcast, giving their ideas, their points, something the establishment does not like.
[2:33:37.440 --> 2:33:40.440]  So, it seems like a simple thing we're doing, but it's what the enemy cannot stand.
[2:33:40.440 --> 2:33:42.440]  We're doing it live here today.
[2:33:42.440 --> 2:33:44.440]  So, honored you've joined us.
[2:33:44.440 --> 2:33:46.440]  All right, let's go to David in Brazil.
[2:33:46.440 --> 2:33:47.440]  David, you're on the air.
[2:33:47.440 --> 2:33:48.440]  Go ahead.
[2:33:48.440 --> 2:33:49.440]  Hi, Alex.
[2:33:49.440 --> 2:33:50.440]  Can you hear me?
[2:33:50.440 --> 2:33:51.440]  I can.
[2:33:51.440 --> 2:33:52.440]  Go ahead.
[2:33:52.440 --> 2:34:02.440]  So, Alex, well, some weeks ago, I saw the economist headline, cover headline, saying,
[2:34:02.440 --> 2:34:05.440]  Bolsonaro, the man who would be Trump.
[2:34:05.440 --> 2:34:08.440]  Bolsonaro is preparing the big light in Brazil.
[2:34:08.440 --> 2:34:16.440]  I saw that headline and I saw the whole article unfold before me, even before I even read it.
[2:34:16.440 --> 2:34:24.440]  Of course, you know what they mean, that Bolsonaro is going to lose the election, is going to claim there was election fraud.
[2:34:24.440 --> 2:34:28.440]  And then, of course, they're going to say, oh, this is a big lie.
[2:34:28.440 --> 2:34:30.440]  He is just going to be like Trump.
[2:34:30.440 --> 2:34:32.440]  He is a sore loser.
[2:34:32.440 --> 2:34:37.440]  And then they're going to immediately de-platform him from all, I mean, all big tech.
[2:34:37.440 --> 2:34:40.440]  And, you know, this is the scripted thing.
[2:34:40.440 --> 2:34:42.440]  This is what's going to happen if he loses.
[2:34:42.440 --> 2:34:52.440]  Of course, when I initially saw that headline, my election fraud, let's say, nature went to DEF CON 2.
[2:34:52.440 --> 2:34:57.440]  DEF CON 1 being the election fraud itself.
[2:34:57.440 --> 2:35:08.440]  Fortunately, it seems that the fake polls that they have been peddling before the election weren't able to match the actual results,
[2:35:08.440 --> 2:35:13.440]  because Bolsonaro actually got quite near.
[2:35:13.440 --> 2:35:17.440]  Lula did not win in the first round, like they said.
[2:35:17.440 --> 2:35:19.440]  Of course, the polls were wrong.
[2:35:19.440 --> 2:35:21.440]  Of course, there was a...
[2:35:21.440 --> 2:35:25.440]  That's right. For those that don't know, they said Bolsonaro was 20 points ahead.
[2:35:25.440 --> 2:35:27.440]  He only lost by six, seven points.
[2:35:27.440 --> 2:35:29.440]  And now they have the runoff.
[2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:34.440]  So there's a definite fraud going on and they don't want fraud being questioned.
[2:35:34.440 --> 2:35:42.440]  Yeah, I would say that Brazil has got the, let's say, the electoral system in Brazil.
[2:35:42.440 --> 2:35:45.440]  Of course, we've got the electronic ballot boxes.
[2:35:45.440 --> 2:35:47.440]  That's not very good.
[2:35:47.440 --> 2:35:56.440]  But the point is that some people said, oh, they stole the election at the counting level.
[2:35:56.440 --> 2:36:08.440]  Unfortunately, that's not really possible because in Brazil, they have to pay the ballot report at the door of the polling section in Brazil.
[2:36:08.440 --> 2:36:21.440]  So any actual fraud absolutely must be done at the ballot box level, flipping the votes as people vote.
[2:36:21.440 --> 2:36:29.440]  Exactly. Notice how the international banks, the whole power structure is backing Bolsonaro's communist competitor.
[2:36:29.440 --> 2:36:39.440]  Yeah. Of course, the big point is that I think the guy that is going to be in power is actually the vice president, Alkmin.
[2:36:39.440 --> 2:36:42.440]  Because Lula is just the guy that has got the vote.
[2:36:42.440 --> 2:36:50.440]  When he's done, they're going to put the World Economic Forum puppet Alkmin in because he is going to be the great recess guy.
[2:36:50.440 --> 2:36:57.440]  And speaking of great recess, I've got the great book here right beside me, Alex Jones, The Great Reset.
[2:36:57.440 --> 2:36:59.440]  Congratulations for this book.
[2:36:59.440 --> 2:37:03.440]  Unfortunately, most people in Brazil are not ready for this kind of information.
[2:37:03.440 --> 2:37:09.440]  We're still mostly at the left-right paradigm.
[2:37:09.440 --> 2:37:16.440]  But okay, that's the point because the problem is that we have communism right at our gates.
[2:37:16.440 --> 2:37:22.440]  Right? Because we've got Venezuela and Argentina now turning communist.
[2:37:22.440 --> 2:37:26.440]  And for those that don't know, Brazil's got more resources than the US.
[2:37:26.440 --> 2:37:33.440]  Brazil could be the superpower of the Western Hemisphere and it just needs to be turned loose.
[2:37:33.440 --> 2:37:38.440]  Yes. Yeah. Unfortunately, Brazil, they say, oh, Brazil is the country of the future.
[2:37:38.440 --> 2:37:42.440]  Unfortunately, it seems that the future never comes.
[2:37:42.440 --> 2:37:50.440]  And unfortunately, Bolsonaro is still, I remember something that you said when Biden was set to win.
[2:37:50.440 --> 2:37:58.440]  You said on your show, actually, it doesn't matter whether Biden wins because if Trump gets elected,
[2:37:58.440 --> 2:38:03.440]  the American people will still be asleep thinking that they are in command.
[2:38:03.440 --> 2:38:05.440]  Same thing with Bolsonaro.
[2:38:05.440 --> 2:38:12.440]  I think Bolsonaro wins. Okay, he keeps battling the deep state and losing. That's the problem.
[2:38:12.440 --> 2:38:13.440]  I mean, because...
[2:38:13.440 --> 2:38:15.440]  Well, that's right. In a way, it's better to make it worse.
[2:38:15.440 --> 2:38:18.440]  But man, I tell you, it's crazy.
[2:38:18.440 --> 2:38:24.440]  Well, that's the problem because elections have consequences, unfortunately.
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:30.440]  You don't know whether you're going to be able to get the World Economic Forum profit out of office
[2:38:30.440 --> 2:38:37.440]  if they have stolen one election. But of course, I would say that from the result of the first round of elections,
[2:38:37.440 --> 2:38:54.440]  my, let's say, election 12 meter drops to dash-con 3 because Bolsonaro actually gained ground on the major, let's say, Lula state
[2:38:54.440 --> 2:39:01.440]  in the north-east of Brazil. Oh, north-east of Brazil mostly is going to vote for the workers party.
[2:39:01.440 --> 2:39:07.440]  But actually, Bolsonaro gained ground there. So, there is hope. Okay?
[2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:11.440]  Well, I got to say, I mean, Bolsonaro has come out against the vaccine. He is as good as it gets.
[2:39:11.440 --> 2:39:16.440]  And what a blessing. And, you know, I just pray for him because he's under such attack.
[2:39:16.440 --> 2:39:19.440]  Thank you so much, David. Amazing from Brazil.
[2:39:19.440 --> 2:39:23.440]  What a smart caller, man. We're so blessed to be here. It's so amazing.
[2:39:23.440 --> 2:39:27.440]  Let's talk to David in Texas a little bit closer than Brazil. Go ahead, David.
[2:39:27.440 --> 2:39:30.440]  Yeah. Hey, Alex, been listening to you for years.
[2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:35.440]  Basically, I was opting out of everything COVID. I don't do the vaccine. I don't do the test.
[2:39:35.440 --> 2:39:39.440]  It didn't take me long to catch on that it was all, you know, something was wrong with it.
[2:39:39.440 --> 2:39:44.440]  Even the mass I stopped very early on. And if I needed them on, I wouldn't go into whatever business it was.
[2:39:44.440 --> 2:39:48.440]  With that said, I was as opted out as you can get.
[2:39:48.440 --> 2:39:54.440]  I got hit in February by a truck walking my dog down a sidewalk, which we think he hit me on purpose,
[2:39:54.440 --> 2:39:59.440]  but that's a separate thing. But what they got me with in the hospital that I never would have okayed
[2:39:59.440 --> 2:40:05.440]  was tetanus, diphtheria, typhoid, cellular pertosis vaccine,
[2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:11.440]  which I'm not worried as much about that as well. I am as this because I never would have okayed this.
[2:40:11.440 --> 2:40:18.440]  HC specimen collection COVID-19 non-CDC. I never would have given Gates my DNA.
[2:40:18.440 --> 2:40:23.440]  I never would have surrendered my DNA. So my question is, is that specimen,
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:28.440]  because from what I understand from what you've said, there's an antigen test, which is the home test,
[2:40:28.440 --> 2:40:35.440]  the rapid test, which may not go to the CDC, but it's the PCR test that is the dangerous one
[2:40:35.440 --> 2:40:39.440]  where the gel gets into your brain with that metallic substance.
[2:40:39.440 --> 2:40:46.440]  And then that goes to Bill Gates and the CDC. How deep in a hole have I non-voluntarily gotten myself?
[2:40:46.440 --> 2:40:53.440]  And is there anything I can do to detox from this? Because like you said, if we can't stand up to this,
[2:40:53.440 --> 2:40:59.440]  I mean, it's minute in comparison to what's coming. If I can't stand up to this, like you said,
[2:40:59.440 --> 2:41:01.440]  I can't stand up to what's coming.
[2:41:01.440 --> 2:41:06.440]  Well, David, there's no way, it's a great question. There's no way I could accurately answer that.
[2:41:06.440 --> 2:41:10.440]  You know more than I do. You experienced it. But most of this is badly coordinated.
[2:41:10.440 --> 2:41:15.440]  It's mainly about them taking over your body. And in most cases, it's not even a real shot.
[2:41:15.440 --> 2:41:20.440]  In most cases, they're not poisoning you with the testing they're doing.
[2:41:20.440 --> 2:41:26.440]  So it's all badly coordinated. It's basically their bum rush of humanity. It's a beta test.
[2:41:26.440 --> 2:41:32.440]  So if you're not feeling sick, if you're not really feeling bad, then it looks like you dodged the bullets.
[2:41:32.440 --> 2:41:36.440]  But I mean, I really, I can't, I can't analyze this from afar.
[2:41:36.440 --> 2:41:41.440]  Sir, and I do take your supplements and your iodine, everything you say about the iodine is correct.
[2:41:41.440 --> 2:41:45.440]  My energy levels are much higher. Can I ask you a second part question real quick?
[2:41:45.440 --> 2:41:46.440]  Go ahead.
[2:41:46.440 --> 2:41:52.440]  My mom did wear the mask for a short period of time. And since then, she's had a chronic cough.
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:54.440]  And we've literally the other day.
[2:41:54.440 --> 2:41:56.440]  Usually that's bacterial pneumonia.
[2:41:56.440 --> 2:42:02.440]  That's what I thought. So we've got your lung cleanse and we're trying to get something from the doctor that isn't just a,
[2:42:02.440 --> 2:42:06.440]  what do you call it, something just to cover the symptoms.
[2:42:06.440 --> 2:42:07.440]  They finally.
[2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:11.440]  Well, I'm no doctor, but she probably needs antibiotics. I'm not a big antibiotics fan.
[2:42:11.440 --> 2:42:15.440]  But I mean, they admit like most, the kids are all getting sick from the mask.
[2:42:15.440 --> 2:42:19.440]  It's bacterial pneumonia. It's a face diaper. You're not meant to be doing that.
[2:42:19.440 --> 2:42:26.440]  It does. It's a whole nother discussion, but your mom probably needs to, you know, to take antibiotics or colloidal silver. Thank you for the call.
[2:42:26.440 --> 2:42:31.440]  And again, I can't diagnose them from afar. I'm not a doctor. I just read all the news constantly and know what they're doing.
[2:42:31.440 --> 2:42:38.440]  I mean, there is just record viral infections, record death, all tied to the vaccine and so much more.
[2:42:38.440 --> 2:42:43.440]  All right, Russell in California, you are up next.
[2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:50.440]  And then we'll go to everybody else, Polly, Davis, Zander, Jason, Patriot, Bruce, Von, Bryce.
[2:42:50.440 --> 2:42:56.440]  We're going to take every one of your calls ahead of Mike Adams.
[2:42:56.440 --> 2:43:02.440]  It's our best seller. We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[2:43:02.440 --> 2:43:08.440]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made him feel and how healthy it made him,
[2:43:08.440 --> 2:43:13.440]  it has become our number one overall best seller. And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back at stock.
[2:43:13.440 --> 2:43:20.440]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[2:43:20.440 --> 2:43:27.440]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[2:43:27.440 --> 2:43:34.440]  Essential means without these things, you die. And so much of the food is debased. There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[2:43:34.440 --> 2:43:38.440]  It is critical to bolster our body defenses with a product like this.
[2:43:38.440 --> 2:43:45.440]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the very best and it's a low price and it funds the infowar.

[2:46:07.440 --> 2:46:10.440]  This family that is Infowars.
[2:46:10.440 --> 2:46:26.440]  Think about how Infowars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[2:46:26.440 --> 2:46:37.440]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[2:46:37.440 --> 2:46:45.440]  I don't take the credit. I give you the credit. And now Infowars is facing its darkest hours. It isn't going to give up.

[2:47:20.440 --> 2:47:27.440]  We're about to go right back to your phone calls and then Mike Adams takes over.
[2:47:27.440 --> 2:47:38.440]  We're doing a special broadcast from 8 a.m. right through my show and right through Ellen's show and the American Journal.
[2:47:38.440 --> 2:47:44.440]  To midnight tomorrow night with a bunch of special guests, it's the same Infowars extended emergency broadcast.
[2:47:44.440 --> 2:47:51.440]  Infowars.com forward slash show on Wednesday, October 12. And we got a bunch of special guests that all be announcing tomorrow.
[2:47:51.440 --> 2:48:01.440]  So I'm asking the listeners to take tomorrow out to share the links to Infowars.com forward slash show and band up video or post our link on your own website.
[2:48:01.440 --> 2:48:09.440]  So it gets past the sensors and send that link out. Whatever you do, take action because it's an information war.
[2:48:09.440 --> 2:48:14.440]  Alright, let's go back to your calls. Up next is Russell in California.
[2:48:14.440 --> 2:48:16.440]  Russell, thanks for calling.
[2:48:16.440 --> 2:48:18.440]  Hey, thank you, Alex. Thank you for taking my call.
[2:48:18.440 --> 2:48:19.440]  Thank you.
[2:48:19.440 --> 2:48:28.440]  This discussion you brought up a few years ago, and I'd like to highlight it for you.
[2:48:28.440 --> 2:48:39.440]  Some people I know who worked for the Border Patrol are telling me that there is a large contingency of combat age young men crossing the border.
[2:48:39.440 --> 2:48:43.440]  Oh, there's countless videos of thousands of men in camo climbing over.
[2:48:43.440 --> 2:48:50.440]  Yes. And what it is is these these guys are they're they're fish out of water. They have no skills.
[2:48:50.440 --> 2:49:01.440]  They're coming into a country that's having, you know, higher gas prices and everything. I have a landscaper contractor who lives next door to me.
[2:49:01.440 --> 2:49:10.440]  He has five, five to eight legal aliens coming to him looking for work and he had to cut back because of gasoline prices and other things.
[2:49:10.440 --> 2:49:20.440]  Now, one of the things I want to bring up is that if you remember Barack Obama needed a domestic police force.
[2:49:20.440 --> 2:49:25.440]  Also, you brought up the fact that they were going to create another green police.
[2:49:25.440 --> 2:49:49.440]  And so what is the possibility of the federal government hiring all these uneducated young men who have no job skills coming into this country and offering them federal jobs in those particular occupations?
[2:49:49.440 --> 2:49:55.440]  Well, there's no doubt that Obama said we need a domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military.
[2:49:55.440 --> 2:50:00.440]  And now that that's what they're they're preparing. They're bringing in groups that won't have jobs or a future that they can control.
[2:50:00.440 --> 2:50:02.440]  I think you're absolutely right.
[2:50:02.440 --> 2:50:07.440]  Yeah, because they have no history or loyalty to the United States.
[2:50:07.440 --> 2:50:13.440]  Well, I think it's bigger than that, but I definitely think they're going to use the illegals to drive down the wages and break down society.
[2:50:13.440 --> 2:50:14.440]  There's no doubt.
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:25.440]  Well, yeah, when you hear defund the police and some of these other organizations who want the police to be something other than a police force.
[2:50:25.440 --> 2:50:29.440]  Yeah, all they're doing there is they're not want to get rid of the police. They want to take control of the police.
[2:50:29.440 --> 2:50:33.440]  Great points, Russell. I think they found the clip of Obama saying it.
[2:50:33.440 --> 2:50:36.440]  This is in.
[2:50:36.440 --> 2:50:42.440]  We're going to play the clip here in just a moment because it just illustrates it all. This has been a long term plan.
[2:50:42.440 --> 2:50:52.440]  And now we have Chinese Communist government police forces in the US and more than 30 cities and in more than 20 cities in Canada and in Europe.
[2:50:52.440 --> 2:50:56.440]  Communist Chinese police. They go, yeah, we're here. We're to watch our citizens.
[2:50:56.440 --> 2:51:00.440]  Do we have US police force in China to watch US citizens?
[2:51:00.440 --> 2:51:07.440]  I mean, this is again, they're breaking the norms. They're getting us used to just more and more insanity like PayPal saying,
[2:51:07.440 --> 2:51:12.440]  Oh, you criticize the government or question elections.
[2:51:12.440 --> 2:51:17.440]  We're going to find you $2,500 outside of government, outside of law.
[2:51:17.440 --> 2:51:23.440]  It's a power grab. People are like, this doesn't make sense. It's totalitarian. Exactly.
[2:51:23.440 --> 2:51:29.440]  That's the season we're in. They're doing whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want. It's a power grab.
[2:51:29.440 --> 2:51:30.440]  Here's Obama.
[2:51:30.440 --> 2:51:38.440]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[2:51:38.440 --> 2:51:50.440]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[2:51:50.440 --> 2:51:52.440]  And run by the new world order.
[2:51:52.440 --> 2:51:55.440]  Polly in Canada. Welcome Polly. Thanks for calling.
[2:51:55.440 --> 2:52:00.440]  How's it going? Yes, that's Holly with an H.
[2:52:00.440 --> 2:52:06.440]  I discovered something in April and I was wondering how it would come to play for my home province.
[2:52:06.440 --> 2:52:11.440]  I'm a new fan from this land and I'm back at the moment. I've been back for a few months.
[2:52:11.440 --> 2:52:17.440]  My husband's in Florida and I'm going back Friday, so I just can't wait to get back to Florida to be honest.
[2:52:17.440 --> 2:52:26.440]  I discovered this document called, you call it the local paradox and grand policy scheme, lessons from Newfoundland and Labrador.
[2:52:26.440 --> 2:52:29.440]  It's published in the Scandinavian Journal of Management.
[2:52:29.440 --> 2:52:35.440]  You can find it on FindsDirect and ResearchGate. You'll have to pay a little bit to get it. You can verify it.
[2:52:35.440 --> 2:52:43.440]  I also have uploaded it in several places and you can find it on Twitter under the hashtag local paradox.
[2:52:43.440 --> 2:52:55.440]  Basically, it's kind of taking in the great reset and they're starting to focus in on what they're going to do locally, Alex, is what I would say.
[2:52:55.440 --> 2:53:01.440]  What they say in the document is the function, local governance, these resources.
[2:53:01.440 --> 2:53:08.440]  Basically, to convince the people of this plan, they're going to have to go ahead and convince the local people.
[2:53:08.440 --> 2:53:14.440]  I think they're starting to hit a bit of a snag as what I would say.
[2:53:14.440 --> 2:53:21.440]  You're talking about agenda 2030 is the program to get us to accept it. The global government take over.
[2:53:21.440 --> 2:53:28.440]  Right on. In this article, the University article, it was authored by a guy named Robert Greenwood of Memorial University.
[2:53:28.440 --> 2:53:31.440]  That's the university here in the province of Newfoundland.
[2:53:31.440 --> 2:53:42.440]  Under the article, insult or keywords, actually, in fact, lists us the great reset and into the article, the reference list,
[2:53:42.440 --> 2:53:45.440]  it lists us that Klaus Schwab's great reset book directly.
[2:53:45.440 --> 2:53:52.440]  I would really like you to read this piece of information, Alex, because right now my area here is called the Port of Port Peninsula.
[2:53:52.440 --> 2:53:55.440]  We're currently being invaded by giant wind turbines.
[2:53:55.440 --> 2:54:03.440]  They're planning for 164 of them to be installed on the Port of Port Peninsula, and it's going to take up about 50% of the crown land.
[2:54:03.440 --> 2:54:07.440]  Hey, I hear you. Everybody's getting hit by the new order. I'm glad you called. Thank you so much.
[2:54:07.440 --> 2:54:12.440]  I want to talk to Jason, Xander, Davis, Patriot, Bruce, Vaughn, Bryce.
[2:54:12.440 --> 2:54:15.440]  I'm going to try to get to all of you ahead of Mike Adams. It's about to take over.
[2:54:15.440 --> 2:54:19.440]  But separately, we need funding. I love the listeners. I appreciate you.
[2:54:19.440 --> 2:54:24.440]  I'm only thankful and I ask you to consider supporting us now and taking action.

[2:55:30.440 --> 2:55:34.440]  Jason in Pennsylvania, you're on the air. Welcome.
[2:55:34.440 --> 2:55:36.440]  Hey, how are you doing today?
[2:55:36.440 --> 2:55:38.440]  In the middle of the war, brother.
[2:55:38.440 --> 2:55:41.440]  Yeah. Well, I was listening to your show earlier.
[2:55:41.440 --> 2:55:43.440]  I've been listening to it for many years.
[2:55:43.440 --> 2:55:47.440]  It was my first time caller. I figured I'd better call. We only got the countdown.
[2:55:47.440 --> 2:55:53.440]  So I'm out here in Pennsylvania and who knows if we're going to survive this attack, they're going to drop on it.
[2:55:53.440 --> 2:55:57.440]  So I want to thank you for everything you've done. It's been a hell of a fight.
[2:55:57.440 --> 2:56:03.440]  And I think we got them on the run, man. They are like a rabid raccoon in the corner.
[2:56:03.440 --> 2:56:08.440]  They're going to pull something big and we all know it.
[2:56:08.440 --> 2:56:12.440]  So I don't know what else we can do, but get ready and God bless.
[2:56:12.440 --> 2:56:17.440]  I agree with you. I'm at the same place. Just tell your family you love them and pray to God.
[2:56:17.440 --> 2:56:20.440]  You've done the best job we could and spread the word, but just know it's coming down.
[2:56:20.440 --> 2:56:23.440]  That's right, man. Thank you so much for everything you've done.
[2:56:23.440 --> 2:56:25.440]  And I'm glad I was able to get on here.
[2:56:25.440 --> 2:56:28.440]  Jason, I'm glad to get to talk to you. I feel the same way, brother.
[2:56:28.440 --> 2:56:31.440]  I really appreciate what you said. I really feel what you're saying.
[2:56:31.440 --> 2:56:35.440]  Okay. So whenever we see each other again, good to know you.
[2:56:35.440 --> 2:56:39.440]  That's where we're at. We may turn this around, but it's bad. It's bad.
[2:56:39.440 --> 2:56:42.440]  It's bad. Let's not lie. Let's just get real.
[2:56:42.440 --> 2:56:46.440]  Let's talk to Vaughn in California. Vaughn, welcome.
[2:56:46.440 --> 2:56:49.440]  Hello. Thank you for taking the call.
[2:56:49.440 --> 2:56:54.440]  Just wanted to talk about, you know, who really cares about Kanye right now
[2:56:54.440 --> 2:56:58.440]  when World War III is about to be lost potentially?
[2:56:58.440 --> 2:57:05.440]  Everyone just needs to get ready, get right with God, and just be with family.
[2:57:05.440 --> 2:57:09.440]  That's about it. That's pretty much all I got.
[2:57:09.440 --> 2:57:14.440]  VMStalkshow.com. He's only 14, doing a great job.
[2:57:14.440 --> 2:57:21.440]  You know, if I was anything like him at 14, I mean, yeah.
[2:57:21.440 --> 2:57:24.440]  Is this a young commentator you're talking about?
[2:57:24.440 --> 2:57:25.440]  Yes, sir.
[2:57:25.440 --> 2:57:27.440]  What's the call signing in?
[2:57:27.440 --> 2:57:32.440]  His website is VMStalkshow.com and his name is Vinker.
[2:57:32.440 --> 2:57:36.440]  All right. Amazing points. Thank you, sir.
[2:57:36.440 --> 2:57:39.440]  All right, I'm going to jam in a few final calls, but I'm not going to cut into Mike Adams
[2:57:39.440 --> 2:58:03.440]  because he's on the warpath. We'll be right back with hour number four.
[2:58:09.440 --> 2:58:14.440]  Every cellular function of the body, it has all the minerals, all the key amino acids,
[2:58:14.440 --> 2:58:18.440]  all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[2:58:18.440 --> 2:58:23.440]  Essential means without these things you die and so much of the food is debased.
[2:58:23.440 --> 2:58:25.440]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[2:58:25.440 --> 2:58:29.440]  It is critical to bolster our bodies defenses with a product like this.
[2:58:29.440 --> 2:58:32.440]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there,
[2:58:32.440 --> 2:58:36.440]  but this is amongst the very best and it's a low price and it funds the info war.
[2:58:36.440 --> 2:58:40.440]  The only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion,

[2:58:47.440 --> 2:58:52.440]  Think about a world without InfoWars.
[2:58:52.440 --> 2:58:56.440]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests
[2:58:56.440 --> 2:58:59.440]  and callers and stories we've broken together.
[2:58:59.440 --> 2:59:02.440]  This family that is InfoWars.
[2:59:02.440 --> 2:59:06.440]  InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro
[2:59:06.440 --> 2:59:12.440]  and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus
[2:59:12.440 --> 2:59:17.440]  towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[2:59:17.440 --> 2:59:21.440]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[2:59:21.440 --> 2:59:25.440]  is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action
[2:59:25.440 --> 2:59:27.440]  and supported this show.
[2:59:27.440 --> 2:59:29.440]  I don't take the credit.
[2:59:29.440 --> 2:59:31.440]  I give you the credit.
[2:59:31.440 --> 2:59:34.440]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[2:59:34.440 --> 2:59:35.440]  It isn't going to give up.
[2:59:35.440 --> 2:59:37.440]  Without your support we can be shut down.
[2:59:37.440 --> 2:59:40.440]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today.

[3:00:09.440 --> 3:00:11.440]  Alex, can you hear me?
[3:00:11.440 --> 3:00:12.440]  I can, brother.
[3:00:12.440 --> 3:00:14.440]  Awesome. It's so good to talk to you finally.
[3:00:14.440 --> 3:00:16.440]  You're mentioning real callers.
[3:00:16.440 --> 3:00:18.440]  Let me tell you about the real.
[3:00:18.440 --> 3:00:23.440]  I'm an ex-democrat in recovery under the Republican Party.
[3:00:23.440 --> 3:00:26.440]  I woke up right around the same time I got sober
[3:00:26.440 --> 3:00:30.440]  and I think that had a lot to do with my new beliefs.
[3:00:30.440 --> 3:00:34.440]  And man, I used to call you when I was like nine or ten years ago
[3:00:34.440 --> 3:00:37.440]  on your show on the Public Access Channel.
[3:00:37.440 --> 3:00:39.440]  And now here we are.
[3:00:39.440 --> 3:00:43.440]  And listen, brother, I agree, but the Republicans aren't either.
[3:00:43.440 --> 3:00:45.440]  It's just they're a little bit better than Democrats.
[3:00:45.440 --> 3:00:47.440]  So I want to be clear.
[3:00:47.440 --> 3:00:49.440]  It's not just like going for the Republicans is going to save us.
[3:00:49.440 --> 3:00:53.440]  It's just the fact that the Democrats are literally cancer.
[3:00:53.440 --> 3:00:54.440]  That's absolutely fact.
[3:00:54.440 --> 3:00:58.440]  It's just a less poisonous version of the same pill.
[3:00:58.440 --> 3:01:01.440]  I wanted to ask you, so those last two calls kind of tie in with this,
[3:01:01.440 --> 3:01:04.440]  except they seem a little somber.
[3:01:04.440 --> 3:01:08.440]  I want to talk about the cyber attacks, national outage.
[3:01:08.440 --> 3:01:10.440]  What happens if the plan goes off?
[3:01:10.440 --> 3:01:12.440]  Like, I'm an Austin City Dweller.
[3:01:12.440 --> 3:01:13.440]  Well, that's a whole other discussion.
[3:01:13.440 --> 3:01:15.440]  What happens if the power goes off?
[3:01:15.440 --> 3:01:16.440]  We should do some whole shows on that.
[3:01:16.440 --> 3:01:19.440]  The reason I know that's coming is they keep pre-programming you,
[3:01:19.440 --> 3:01:23.440]  telling you it's imminent, and then claiming the Russians are going to do it.
[3:01:23.440 --> 3:01:26.440]  So that's why I'm worried about it.
[3:01:26.440 --> 3:01:28.440]  That's exactly what I'm thinking, too.
[3:01:28.440 --> 3:01:32.440]  There's a lot of warning coming out from a lot of different outlets about that.
[3:01:32.440 --> 3:01:34.440]  And I'm just wondering, do you have a plan?
[3:01:34.440 --> 3:01:36.440]  Do you have a message to the people?
[3:01:36.440 --> 3:01:38.440]  I mean, no, I've been so busy fighting.
[3:01:38.440 --> 3:01:39.440]  I really don't have a plan.
[3:01:39.440 --> 3:01:41.440]  I mean, I try to have my tank full.
[3:01:41.440 --> 3:01:43.440]  We've got a place in the country to run to.
[3:01:43.440 --> 3:01:44.440]  A little bit of food there.
[3:01:44.440 --> 3:01:46.440]  I've been so busy on the offense.
[3:01:46.440 --> 3:01:47.440]  I don't have a defense brother.
[3:01:47.440 --> 3:01:49.440]  Good to have you with us, Dave.
[3:01:49.440 --> 3:01:51.440]  Davis, I love you, and I appreciate you.
[3:01:51.440 --> 3:01:53.440]  All right, let's go ahead and take more calls here.
[3:01:53.440 --> 3:01:55.440]  Going as fast as we can.
[3:01:55.440 --> 3:01:58.440]  Bryce in Ohio, you're on the air.
[3:01:58.440 --> 3:01:59.440]  Hello?
[3:01:59.440 --> 3:02:01.440]  Yes, go ahead.
[3:02:01.440 --> 3:02:09.440]  Oh, my question is, in regards to the 2020 election, right?
[3:02:09.440 --> 3:02:13.440]  There's many people like me who genuinely think it was fraudulent.
[3:02:13.440 --> 3:02:17.440]  Was that going forward to elections in the future?
[3:02:17.440 --> 3:02:19.440]  What do you think we could do?
[3:02:19.440 --> 3:02:25.440]  Or something that we said, I guess you could justify that they would be
[3:02:25.440 --> 3:02:27.440]  legit in the future.
[3:02:27.440 --> 3:02:31.440]  We have to end mail-in ballots other than absentee where the person
[3:02:31.440 --> 3:02:33.440]  signs up for themselves.
[3:02:33.440 --> 3:02:35.440]  That's totally legitimate and a good thing.
[3:02:35.440 --> 3:02:36.440]  Absentee, you're going to be out of town.
[3:02:36.440 --> 3:02:37.440]  You're in the military.
[3:02:37.440 --> 3:02:38.440]  You go yourself.
[3:02:38.440 --> 3:02:39.440]  You file for it.
[3:02:39.440 --> 3:02:40.440]  You get it.
[3:02:40.440 --> 3:02:43.440]  But just randomly mailing out millions of ballots and letting them do it.
[3:02:43.440 --> 3:02:45.440]  The biggest thing we do is stop that fraud.
[3:02:45.440 --> 3:02:47.440]  Oh, I agree.
[3:02:47.440 --> 3:02:50.440]  I'll never forget watching the election with my brother.
[3:02:50.440 --> 3:02:54.440]  And at like 1 a.m., they stopped accounting and all these mail-in ballots
[3:02:54.440 --> 3:03:00.440]  come in and for some reason they're all for Democrats.
[3:03:00.440 --> 3:03:03.440]  And they're saying the ultimate crime is questioning an election.
[3:03:03.440 --> 3:03:07.440]  No, we're going to continue to question no matter what they do to us.
[3:03:07.440 --> 3:03:09.440]  Oh, of course.
[3:03:09.440 --> 3:03:11.440]  But no, that's about it.
[3:03:11.440 --> 3:03:12.440]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[3:03:12.440 --> 3:03:14.440]  I appreciate you.
[3:03:14.440 --> 3:03:15.440]  All right.
[3:03:15.440 --> 3:03:17.440]  I got Bruce and I got Xander and I got a minute and a half left.
[3:03:17.440 --> 3:03:19.440]  Let's go to Bruce in Kentucky.
[3:03:19.440 --> 3:03:21.440]  Go ahead, Bruce.
[3:03:21.440 --> 3:03:22.440]  Yeah.
[3:03:22.440 --> 3:03:26.440]  Alex, I wanted to mention about the voter's election.
[3:03:26.440 --> 3:03:28.440]  I believe the elections will go on.
[3:03:28.440 --> 3:03:31.440]  But the problem is they haven't fixed the problems of 2020.
[3:03:31.440 --> 3:03:35.440]  They're still going to be using the machines that they can change and manipulate.
[3:03:35.440 --> 3:03:39.440]  So it's not those they say who vote, but those who count the votes.
[3:03:39.440 --> 3:03:44.440]  So I believe the loss is right there unless we can change that around.
[3:03:44.440 --> 3:03:49.440]  And the second thing is the PCR test for the COVID or whatever.
[3:03:49.440 --> 3:03:52.440]  They got the globalists now have most people's DNA.
[3:03:52.440 --> 3:03:53.440]  No, that's right.
[3:03:53.440 --> 3:03:54.440]  They admit it.
[3:03:54.440 --> 3:03:55.440]  We told them two years ago.
[3:03:55.440 --> 3:03:56.440]  It's a DNA test.
[3:03:56.440 --> 3:03:57.440]  The test is a fraud.
[3:03:57.440 --> 3:03:58.440]  Great point.
[3:03:58.440 --> 3:03:59.440]  God bless you.
[3:03:59.440 --> 3:04:00.440]  But Jamon, one more call.
[3:04:00.440 --> 3:04:01.440]  Apologize cutting you short.
[3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:02.440]  Xander in Wisconsin.
[3:04:02.440 --> 3:04:03.440]  Go ahead.
[3:04:03.440 --> 3:04:05.440]  Yeah, I'll be real quick.
[3:04:05.440 --> 3:04:10.440]  You said you like the wildcard calls and I went to a Jesuit college and the Jesuit priest
[3:04:10.440 --> 3:04:15.440]  would tell us in theology class that the way God parted the Red Sea for Moses is with
[3:04:15.440 --> 3:04:19.440]  his male member, and I think that's a lot of things lacking right now is the power of
[3:04:19.440 --> 3:04:20.440]  male energy.
[3:04:20.440 --> 3:04:26.440]  Tucker Carlson has highlighted in Christianity it's male and female genders.
[3:04:26.440 --> 3:04:27.440]  We're in the Talmud.
[3:04:27.440 --> 3:04:34.440]  They have multiple genders like androgynous, Tum Tum, which is lacking sexual characteristic.
[3:04:34.440 --> 3:04:39.440]  Alonnet Hamah, Alonnet Adam, Cyrus Hamah and Cyrus Adam.
[3:04:39.440 --> 3:04:42.440]  And they're strikingly similar to LGBTQ.
[3:04:42.440 --> 3:04:48.800]  I'm not saying there shouldn't be LGBTQ stuff, but I think the U.S. majority of people would
[3:04:48.800 --> 3:04:49.800]  align more.
[3:04:49.800 --> 3:04:50.960]  Call me back Xander.
[3:04:50.960 --> 3:04:53.120]  The great Mike Adams takes over now.
[3:04:53.120 --> 3:04:57.440]  Thank you Xander.
[3:04:57.440 --> 3:04:59.600]  Fluoride is the enemy.
[3:04:59.600 --> 3:05:05.080]  It's the bad halogen to the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[3:05:05.080 --> 3:05:06.800]  What's the good halogen?
[3:05:06.800 --> 3:05:11.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine and we have the highest quality iodine you're going

[3:06:00.640 --> 3:06:11.560]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[3:06:11.560 --> 3:06:15.880]  All right welcome folks to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show here on infowars.com.
[3:06:15.880 --> 3:06:22.960]  I'm Mike Adams, the health ranger from naturalnews.com and I'm going to be driving the train of
[3:06:22.960 --> 3:06:25.040]  information through this hour.
[3:06:25.040 --> 3:06:27.720]  We have a lot coming up, you're going to just be blown away.
[3:06:27.720 --> 3:06:31.800]  I've got a special guest joining us at the bottom of the hour that has I think a really
[3:06:31.800 --> 3:06:32.800]  special analysis.
[3:06:32.800 --> 3:06:37.640]  The first time guest, you may not have heard from this person before, he's got a fantastic
[3:06:37.640 --> 3:06:43.000]  analysis of where things are going and how we win this on a spiritual front.
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:48.080]  But getting just kind of from what Alex and a lot of the callers just said, yes, there
[3:06:48.080 --> 3:06:52.120]  is probably going to be a cyber attack false flag in the United States.
[3:06:52.120 --> 3:06:55.320]  It'll be carried out by the deep state to be blamed on Russia.
[3:06:55.320 --> 3:06:59.920]  And yes, in addition to that, at some point, this war goes nuclear.
[3:06:59.920 --> 3:07:05.480]  And it seems like the United States will be struck by a nuclear weapon that could be the
[3:07:05.480 --> 3:07:11.160]  Poseidon underwater nuclear drone that Russia has, they've been, well, they've deployed their
[3:07:11.160 --> 3:07:15.440]  massive submarine now that carries eight of these Poseidon weapons systems.
[3:07:15.440 --> 3:07:21.320]  And these can cause what's called the radioactive tidal wave to inundate coastal cities.
[3:07:21.320 --> 3:07:25.480]  And if you look at the geography of the power centers of the continental United States, you
[3:07:25.480 --> 3:07:29.320]  realize that the power centers are all along the coast.
[3:07:29.320 --> 3:07:34.840]  Of course, you've got Washington D.C., you've got Norfolk, Virginia, you've got New York
[3:07:34.840 --> 3:07:39.280]  City, you know, the financial capital of America and so on, all within striking distance of
[3:07:39.280 --> 3:07:42.360]  a single nuclear detonation on the East Coast.
[3:07:42.360 --> 3:07:46.880]  And that would render those coastal areas uninhabitable for about three centuries by
[3:07:46.880 --> 3:07:47.880]  the way.
[3:07:47.880 --> 3:07:52.400]  So it's not just the tidal wave, it's the fact that then the ocean water, which would
[3:07:52.400 --> 3:07:58.800]  be radioactive at that point, would deposit radioisotopes onto the land quite a few miles
[3:07:58.800 --> 3:08:00.440]  inland.
[3:08:00.440 --> 3:08:04.520]  And that, those radioisotopes would be impossible to clear away.
[3:08:04.520 --> 3:08:08.520]  And they would render the entire area, again, uninhabitable for at least 300 years because
[3:08:08.520 --> 3:08:14.320]  that's 10 half lives of cesium 137, by the way, you have to have 10 half lives before
[3:08:14.320 --> 3:08:15.560]  it's really safe to go back.
[3:08:15.560 --> 3:08:21.000]  That's why Chernobyl, you can't move in to the park next to Chernobyl right now, not
[3:08:21.000 --> 3:08:25.280]  for, you know, almost 300 years because it hasn't even been that long since what was
[3:08:25.280 --> 3:08:26.780]  it, 1986.
[3:08:26.780 --> 3:08:37.560]  So with that said, yes, you need to consider iodine, absolutely, I 100% support that.
[3:08:37.560 --> 3:08:42.800]  If you don't have iodine, I don't know, you're crazy, you've got to get some.
[3:08:42.800 --> 3:08:46.760]  In my opinion, iodine is going to be an incredible barter item as well.
[3:08:46.760 --> 3:08:51.360]  So check out info wars store.com, just make sure you got your supplies squared away.
[3:08:51.360 --> 3:08:58.440]  But in addition to the oral iodine, make sure you also have antiseptic first aid components
[3:08:58.440 --> 3:09:02.320]  because, well, and that would include povidone iodine, by the way, which is not something
[3:09:02.320 --> 3:09:05.080]  that you could drink or consume.
[3:09:05.080 --> 3:09:10.080]  But what a lot of people don't know is that if you apply povidone iodine to your skin,
[3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:13.700]  that it has a double acting effect.
[3:09:13.700 --> 3:09:17.480]  It actually absorbs some iodine through your skin as well.
[3:09:17.480 --> 3:09:22.760]  So you can actually, in an emergency, you can, in essence, take iodine through your
[3:09:22.760 --> 3:09:23.760]  skin.
[3:09:23.760 --> 3:09:28.920]  A lot of people don't know that, but it absorbs quite well through that vector as well.
[3:09:28.920 --> 3:09:34.360]  So also make sure you've got hydrogen peroxide, make sure you've got isopropyl alcohol.
[3:09:34.360 --> 3:09:38.360]  These are things that are very easy to get, very inexpensive to get.
[3:09:38.360 --> 3:09:41.440]  You can, I mean, you just go out to a local pharmacy and get a lot of these things, like
[3:09:41.440 --> 3:09:48.800]  the IPA, or make sure you can get chlorine dioxide, which makes a really nice antibacterial
[3:09:48.800 --> 3:09:50.960]  topical kind of spray.
[3:09:50.960 --> 3:09:57.120]  It also is used to kill bacteria in water supplies as well, so it's used in water filtration.
[3:09:57.120 --> 3:10:02.080]  So many of these things are going to need because when the grid goes down, you're not
[3:10:02.080 --> 3:10:06.880]  going to have clean water anymore, and a lot of the sewage systems that run these cities
[3:10:06.880 --> 3:10:08.560]  are going to stop working.
[3:10:08.560 --> 3:10:14.640]  So you're going to have overflowing raw sewage in every major city, not just San Francisco,
[3:10:14.640 --> 3:10:15.720]  which is where it is now.
[3:10:15.720 --> 3:10:20.160]  I'm talking about every city in America because when the sewage system stops working, but
[3:10:20.160 --> 3:10:23.080]  people keep flushing, guess what happens?
[3:10:23.080 --> 3:10:27.880]  Becomes a very ugly situation and a very unsanitary situation very, very quickly.
[3:10:27.880 --> 3:10:33.120]  You're going to start to have a lot of deaths from cholera and just, you know, sort of,
[3:10:33.120 --> 3:10:37.840]  I don't know, 17th century types of diseases from a lack of basic sanitation, a lack of
[3:10:37.840 --> 3:10:39.240]  plumbing and so on.
[3:10:39.240 --> 3:10:42.440]  So you're going to need to be prepared for that.
[3:10:42.440 --> 3:10:46.880]  You need to be prepared for a low-tech survival scenario.
[3:10:46.880 --> 3:10:49.000]  And I've actually done a whole book on this.
[3:10:49.000 --> 3:10:50.560]  It's a free audio book.
[3:10:50.560 --> 3:10:52.480]  If you want to download it, by the way, it's free.
[3:10:52.480 --> 3:10:58.880]  It's at resilientprepping.com, but I talk about low-tech solutions and no-tech solutions.
[3:10:58.880 --> 3:11:02.560]  So if you want to learn how to survive without any technology, which I think is necessary,
[3:11:02.560 --> 3:11:05.480]  that's what happens when the grid goes down.
[3:11:05.480 --> 3:11:10.080]  There are ways to do that with food, medicine, money, shelter, all of it.
[3:11:10.080 --> 3:11:12.280]  You can live without electricity.
[3:11:12.280 --> 3:11:15.000]  Not going to be fun, not a pretty scenario.
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:18.720]  And most people probably won't live through it because they don't know what to do when
[3:11:18.720 --> 3:11:19.720]  the lights go off.
[3:11:19.720 --> 3:11:23.280]  But you, the Infowars listener, you know, you're well aware.
[3:11:23.280 --> 3:11:27.400]  You're probably more prepared than 999 out of 1,000 people.
[3:11:27.400 --> 3:11:31.840]  So yes, you can make it through this, but you need to get information and get well-prepared.
[3:11:31.840 --> 3:11:38.640]  By the way, as a programming note, I've been posting my daily podcast now to band.video
[3:11:38.640 --> 3:11:40.160]  on the Infowars platform.
[3:11:40.160 --> 3:11:44.200]  So you can get everything that I'm doing, all the interviews I'm doing and so on, at
[3:11:44.200 --> 3:11:45.680]  band.video.
[3:11:45.680 --> 3:11:48.120]  Just look for Mike Adams there on that channel.
[3:11:48.120 --> 3:11:53.160]  I did an interview last night that just got posted today, which is related to the topic
[3:11:53.160 --> 3:11:54.160]  here.
[3:11:54.160 --> 3:11:57.040]  I interviewed Ben Armstrong from the New American.
[3:11:57.040 --> 3:12:02.320]  And Ben Armstrong had a fascinating analysis of the book of Revelation, and he believes,
[3:12:02.320 --> 3:12:08.400]  based on his analysis, that New York City is Babylon, as is described in, I believe,
[3:12:08.400 --> 3:12:10.680]  chapter 18 of the book of Revelation.
[3:12:10.680 --> 3:12:14.160]  It starts in chapter 17 and then segues into chapter 18.
[3:12:14.160 --> 3:12:18.280]  And for those of you familiar with Scripture, you know that the great city of Babylon, the
[3:12:18.280 --> 3:12:23.400]  city of all the riches and all the trade and the world's hub for importing and exporting,
[3:12:23.400 --> 3:12:26.080]  the city falls in one hour.
[3:12:26.080 --> 3:12:31.440]  It falls into ruin, while the ship captains are off the coast of the city looking at it,
[3:12:31.440 --> 3:12:34.760]  a smoking ruin as the city is completely destroyed.
[3:12:34.760 --> 3:12:41.160]  Well, according to Ben Armstrong, who is quite a scholar in this area, he's been studying
[3:12:41.160 --> 3:12:43.600]  this for more than 20 years.
[3:12:43.600 --> 3:12:48.600]  He believes that New York City is Babylon, and by the way, he's not arguing with people
[3:12:48.600 --> 3:12:49.600]  who have a different interpretation.
[3:12:49.600 --> 3:12:53.680]  He's just adding another layer, so it's okay to have different interpretations on all this.
[3:12:53.680 --> 3:12:57.360]  I don't want to start any arguments over what Scripture says.
[3:12:57.360 --> 3:13:03.040]  But then also, in chapter 18, and I forgot what verse is, it seems like it's verse 23
[3:13:03.040 --> 3:13:12.600]  or 20, I think it's 23, it talks about in the translation how the spell was shared with
[3:13:12.600 --> 3:13:17.960]  all the nations of the world and destroyed them and brought great death through the blood
[3:13:17.960 --> 3:13:22.240]  and killed off the apostles and all the people of God through the blood.
[3:13:22.240 --> 3:13:28.840]  Well, in the original Greek, that word spell is actually pharmakia.
[3:13:28.840 --> 3:13:33.080]  So what Ben Armstrong was explaining to me in an interview that I think is posted on Van.video
[3:13:33.080 --> 3:13:39.600]  right now, is that he believes that actually what Scripture was predicting was that big
[3:13:39.600 --> 3:13:45.440]  pharma and its vaccines and the spike protein would be the, quote, spell or the sorcery or
[3:13:45.440 --> 3:13:53.720]  the pharmakia that kills billions all across the world through their contaminated blood.
[3:13:53.720 --> 3:13:59.040]  And it's like, wow, all of a sudden the Scripture makes instant sense and you look at the evil
[3:13:59.040 --> 3:14:02.840]  behind this and how all the clues now line up.
[3:14:02.840 --> 3:14:06.960]  And then just today, we're going to play this clip when we come back, by the way, in the
[3:14:06.960 --> 3:14:08.640]  next segment.
[3:14:08.640 --> 3:14:13.520]  Just today, a member of European Parliament has announced just a bombshell that's rocking
[3:14:13.520 --> 3:14:19.720]  the world right now where Pfizer, under questioning at the European Parliament, a Pfizer spokesperson
[3:14:19.720 --> 3:14:26.000]  admits that Pfizer never tested their vaccine against a transmission.
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:31.880]  So the vaccine, there's no science whatsoever to support the idea that this can halt transmission
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:36.920]  or to support the vaccine mandates that say that if people are vaccinated, then they won't
[3:14:36.920 --> 3:14:41.600]  contribute to the spread of COVID or that everybody needs to be vaccinated in order to achieve
[3:14:41.600 --> 3:14:45.400]  herd immunity or that everybody at work needs to be vaccinated, everybody in the military
[3:14:45.400 --> 3:14:46.400]  needs to be vaccinated.
[3:14:46.400 --> 3:14:48.480]  There's no science behind it at all.
[3:14:48.480 --> 3:14:51.320]  It was a complete fraud, totally made up.
[3:14:51.320 --> 3:14:53.880]  We're going to watch that clip after this coming break.
[3:14:53.880 --> 3:14:55.720]  It's just mind blowing.
[3:14:55.720 --> 3:15:01.600]  But yes, the pharmakia is destroying the world or I should say it's one of the many vectors
[3:15:01.600 --> 3:15:05.160]  that is achieving mass depopulation right now.
[3:15:05.160 --> 3:15:11.120]  And apparently that has been foretold in chapter 18 of the book of Revelation.
[3:15:11.120 --> 3:15:13.960]  And of course, I'm not the Bible scholar here.
[3:15:13.960 --> 3:15:16.880]  Just passing this along to you, people may disagree with interpretations.
[3:15:16.880 --> 3:15:17.880]  That's fine.
[3:15:17.880 --> 3:15:23.240]  But at least open your eyes and take a look at this because, you know, God knows everything
[3:15:23.240 --> 3:15:25.640]  and he knew it long before it all happened.
[3:15:25.640 --> 3:15:28.360]  So we know what's going down.
[3:15:28.360 --> 3:15:33.600]  And also, by the way, Ben Armstrong believes that we have not yet entered the tribulation,
[3:15:33.600 --> 3:15:38.920]  which means we've got seven years of hell on earth yet to come on top of everything
[3:15:38.920 --> 3:15:40.720]  we're experiencing right now.
[3:15:40.720 --> 3:15:44.920]  So folks, get prepared because it's going to get worse before it gets better.
[3:15:44.920 --> 3:15:48.240]  Turns out, that's kind of where we are right now in reality.
[3:15:48.240 --> 3:15:49.240]  I'm Mike Adams.
[3:15:49.240 --> 3:15:51.760]  We'll be right back after this break with that video clip and much more.

[3:19:57.040 --> 3:20:08.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:08.920 --> 3:20:15.680]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want answers, well so does
[3:20:15.680 --> 3:20:19.400]  he, it's Mike Adams.
[3:20:19.400 --> 3:20:25.080]  Alright, we're about to go to a bombshell video clip that just emerged today, I want
[3:20:25.080 --> 3:20:29.920]  to give a shout out to Citizen Free Press for finding this and posting this, it's been
[3:20:29.920 --> 3:20:30.920]  going viral.
[3:20:30.920 --> 3:20:36.960]  A European Parliament member has, well, was asking a Pfizer representative as part of
[3:20:36.960 --> 3:20:42.800]  this testimony whether the Pfizer vaccine for COVID had ever been tested versus transmission.
[3:20:42.800 --> 3:20:47.840]  In other words, does it stop the transmission of this virus, does it stop person to person
[3:20:47.840 --> 3:20:51.560]  catching of this virus and well, the answer was no.
[3:20:51.560 --> 3:20:56.200]  So in other words, all this so-called science and follow the science and I believe in science
[3:20:56.200 --> 3:21:02.080]  and all this stuff turns out to be nothing but total hogwash and frankly every mainstream
[3:21:02.080 --> 3:21:07.640]  media outlet in the world needs to publish a retraction if they ever said that this vaccine
[3:21:07.640 --> 3:21:10.960]  was proven safe or effective because it wasn't.
[3:21:10.960 --> 3:21:16.040]  Let's go to that two minute clip right now and check out this just fascinating testimony.
[3:21:16.040 --> 3:21:17.560]  Let's go to that.
[3:21:17.560 --> 3:21:21.240]  If you don't get vaccinated, you're anti-social.
[3:21:21.240 --> 3:21:25.280]  This is what the Dutch Prime Minister and Health Minister told us.
[3:21:25.280 --> 3:21:29.640]  You don't get vaccinated just for yourself, but also for others.
[3:21:29.640 --> 3:21:32.120]  You do it for all of society.
[3:21:32.120 --> 3:21:33.720]  That's what I said.
[3:21:33.720 --> 3:21:37.240]  Today this turned out to be complete nonsense.
[3:21:37.240 --> 3:21:42.280]  In a COVID hearing in the European Parliament, one of the Pfizer directors just admitted
[3:21:42.280 --> 3:21:48.560]  to me at the time of introduction, the vaccine had never been tested on stopping the transmission
[3:21:48.560 --> 3:21:50.480]  of the virus.
[3:21:50.480 --> 3:21:55.800]  This removes the entire legal basis for the COVID passport, the COVID password that led
[3:21:55.800 --> 3:22:02.760]  to massive institutional discrimination as people lost access to essential parts of society.
[3:22:02.760 --> 3:22:06.120]  I find this to be shocking, even criminal.
[3:22:06.120 --> 3:22:08.120]  Please watch the video until the end.
[3:22:08.120 --> 3:22:14.040]  For Ume Vrausmol, I have the following question, which I want a clear answer to.
[3:22:14.040 --> 3:22:17.840]  And I will speak in English so there are no misunderstandings.
[3:22:17.840 --> 3:22:27.880]  Was the Pfizer COVID vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered
[3:22:27.880 --> 3:22:30.200]  the market?
[3:22:30.200 --> 3:22:32.880]  If not, please say it clearly.
[3:22:32.880 --> 3:22:37.520]  If yes, are you willing to share the data with this committee?
[3:22:37.520 --> 3:22:41.880]  And I really want a straight answer, yes or no, and I'm looking forward to it.
[3:22:41.880 --> 3:22:43.880]  Thank you very much.
[3:22:43.880 --> 3:22:49.200]  Regarding the question around, did we know about stopping humanisation before it entered
[3:22:49.200 --> 3:22:50.200]  the market?
[3:22:50.200 --> 3:22:51.200]  No.
[3:22:51.200 --> 3:22:56.440]  These, you know, we had to really move at the speed of science to really understand
[3:22:56.440 --> 3:22:59.000]  what is taking place in the market.
[3:22:59.000 --> 3:23:05.000]  This is scandalous, millions of people worldwide felt forced to get vaccinated because of the
[3:23:05.000 --> 3:23:08.000]  myth that you do it for others.
[3:23:08.000 --> 3:23:11.480]  Now, this turned out to be a cheap lie.
[3:23:11.480 --> 3:23:12.960]  This should be exposed.
[3:23:12.960 --> 3:23:16.280]  Please share this video.
[3:23:16.280 --> 3:23:20.160]  I love how she was saying, essentially, we didn't have time to do the science because
[3:23:20.160 --> 3:23:22.760]  we had to move at the speed of science.
[3:23:22.760 --> 3:23:25.480]  It's like, wow, you're just fraudsters.
[3:23:25.480 --> 3:23:28.200]  You're just making it all up and claiming it's science.
[3:23:28.200 --> 3:23:29.200]  What does that mean?
[3:23:29.200 --> 3:23:33.360]  We had to move at the speed of science, but in order to do so, we had to skip the science.
[3:23:33.360 --> 3:23:35.080]  I mean, come on.
[3:23:35.080 --> 3:23:36.080]  It's a clown world, folks.
[3:23:36.080 --> 3:23:40.800]  I mean, this is idiocracy on steroids, but of course, you and I, we've known this the
[3:23:40.800 --> 3:23:46.480]  whole time, but now it's coming out more and more in, you know, mainstream conversations
[3:23:46.480 --> 3:23:47.480]  here.
[3:23:47.480 --> 3:23:50.200]  So I really want to congratulate that member of the EU Parliament.
[3:23:50.200 --> 3:23:54.680]  I don't know his name, but obviously, he's got the courage to ask these questions and
[3:23:54.680 --> 3:23:55.680]  help bring this out.
[3:23:55.680 --> 3:24:00.800]  And you may have noticed that, well, the vaccine manufacturers are refusing to release the underlying
[3:24:00.800 --> 3:24:04.640]  data that they claim shows the vaccine even worked.
[3:24:04.640 --> 3:24:09.040]  So the whole idea of, quote, peer-reviewed science is just being thrown out the window
[3:24:09.040 --> 3:24:10.040]  here.
[3:24:10.040 --> 3:24:13.720]  There's no peer review allowed because they say, well, the data, it's a secret.
[3:24:13.720 --> 3:24:15.960]  It's all secret data, super secret.
[3:24:15.960 --> 3:24:17.840]  No one's allowed to see it.
[3:24:17.840 --> 3:24:22.880]  Every time these organizations say that, it turns out to be total fraud, by the way.
[3:24:22.880 --> 3:24:28.000]  So now they're just playing a delay game, trying to prevent the data from being revealed
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:31.360]  because when the data do come out, guess what?
[3:24:31.360 --> 3:24:35.360]  It's going to show the whole thing was a complete fraud from day one.
[3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:39.240]  And I did a recent interview, by the way, with Karen Kingston, that was just bombshell.
[3:24:39.240 --> 3:24:42.720]  That's also posted on band.video, by the way, if you want to check it out there.
[3:24:42.720 --> 3:24:44.960]  That was just a few days ago.
[3:24:44.960 --> 3:24:51.480]  And she shows that actually this entire vaccination effort was not about immunization at all.
[3:24:51.480 --> 3:24:53.760]  It was about installation.
[3:24:53.760 --> 3:24:57.320]  You were being installed with an operating system.
[3:24:57.320 --> 3:25:01.680]  You were being installed with some kind of exotic technology that has some other nefarious
[3:25:01.680 --> 3:25:06.600]  purpose far beyond immunization because immunization didn't even work.
[3:25:06.600 --> 3:25:10.520]  Even as you just saw, Pfizer just admitted, they didn't even test to see if it stopped
[3:25:10.520 --> 3:25:13.000]  transmission or if it worked for immunization.
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:17.560]  It's a complete, complete fraud that they pushed, of course, but you've known that this
[3:25:17.560 --> 3:25:18.960]  entire time.
[3:25:18.960 --> 3:25:20.400]  All right.
[3:25:20.400 --> 3:25:24.760]  We've got more troops pouring into Belarus today from Russia, and Russia launching another
[3:25:24.760 --> 3:25:31.640]  wave of missiles maybe 12 hours ago or less, hitting targets all across Ukraine.
[3:25:31.640 --> 3:25:35.640]  So I want to point out another mass media lie in all of this.
[3:25:35.640 --> 3:25:40.280]  In March or April of this year, we were told that Russia had run out of missiles.
[3:25:40.280 --> 3:25:44.080]  And that's why they had to resort to their hypersonic missiles like the dagger.
[3:25:44.080 --> 3:25:49.000]  I think it's called the Kinzhal or some similar word to that.
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:54.160]  And so that lie turned out to be, of course, complete nonsense because it turns out Putin
[3:25:54.160 --> 3:25:57.000]  was just restraining the use of missiles.
[3:25:57.000 --> 3:26:02.400]  He actually has plenty of missiles, and he's just done two days in a row of many dozens
[3:26:02.400 --> 3:26:07.280]  of missile strikes hitting targets across Ukraine and taking out in some cases some
[3:26:07.280 --> 3:26:13.400]  electrical infrastructure capabilities and so on, which the West is now condemning, oh,
[3:26:13.400 --> 3:26:17.400]  how dare Putin attack infrastructure that affects civilians.
[3:26:17.400 --> 3:26:22.880]  And I'm thinking, do any of these neocons and leftists, do they even remember Desert
[3:26:22.880 --> 3:26:23.880]  Storm?
[3:26:23.880 --> 3:26:29.280]  Do they remember Iraq and the Middle East and how the U.S. carpet bombed the water system,
[3:26:29.280 --> 3:26:32.960]  the power system, the roads, the bridges, everything?
[3:26:32.960 --> 3:26:37.040]  And then they all jump on Trump and say, yeah, you shouldn't build walls, you should build
[3:26:37.040 --> 3:26:41.800]  bridges except now the left says they should blow up all the bridges, apparently, you know,
[3:26:41.800 --> 3:26:43.720]  if they're in Crimea, for example.
[3:26:43.720 --> 3:26:45.480]  So it's completely insane.
[3:26:45.480 --> 3:26:50.280]  And this is why I really want to give a thumbs up to Tulsi Gabbard today who, you know, left
[3:26:50.280 --> 3:26:52.920]  the Democrat Party and issued quite a dramatic statement.
[3:26:52.920 --> 3:26:55.440]  I'm sure InfoWars covered that earlier.
[3:26:55.440 --> 3:27:01.560]  But Tulsi Gabbard gets my vote as a person with principles.
[3:27:01.560 --> 3:27:06.880]  And frankly, I don't even care if someone agrees with me on every single point.
[3:27:06.880 --> 3:27:12.480]  I just, I want to deal with people who have principles and are consistent in their principles.
[3:27:12.480 --> 3:27:17.880]  And Tulsi Gabbard, even though she, you know, she was a Democrat and maybe you don't like
[3:27:17.880 --> 3:27:22.600]  everything that she's ever said, of course, but she is a woman with principles and she
[3:27:22.600 --> 3:27:25.320]  sticks to those principles and she is now proving that.
[3:27:25.320 --> 3:27:30.920]  And I think she has a very strong political future in any party or maybe above all the
[3:27:30.920 --> 3:27:33.880]  parties, frankly, because she can bridge both parties.
[3:27:33.880 --> 3:27:37.760]  And she has my support if she wants to run for office.
[3:27:37.760 --> 3:27:43.720]  Also want to mention Kerry Lake out of Arizona is speaking of remarkable women in politics.
[3:27:43.720 --> 3:27:46.520]  Kerry Lake is just just a breath of fresh air here.
[3:27:46.520 --> 3:27:47.720]  She is just amazing.
[3:27:47.720 --> 3:27:49.360]  I think she's going to win Arizona.
[3:27:49.360 --> 3:27:53.800]  All of you, of course, need to vote for her and support her in her campaign.
[3:27:53.800 --> 3:27:57.320]  And she just takes it to all the haters and the trolls.
[3:27:57.320 --> 3:28:04.000]  And Kerry Lake is just setting an example of what I wish GOP men would act like.
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:06.560]  Hey, hey, you GOP sissy men.
[3:28:06.560 --> 3:28:13.840]  Why don't you cowboy up and act at least as manly as Kerry Lake, a woman who is outmanning
[3:28:13.840 --> 3:28:14.840]  you?
[3:28:14.840 --> 3:28:15.840]  I mean, seriously.
[3:28:15.840 --> 3:28:18.680]  And by the way, I don't care if Kerry Lake is a woman or a man.
[3:28:18.680 --> 3:28:20.240]  Gender doesn't mean anything.
[3:28:20.240 --> 3:28:24.800]  I'm, again, looking for people with principles, backbone and courage.
[3:28:24.800 --> 3:28:27.320]  And that's Tulsi Gabbard and that's Kerry Lake.
[3:28:27.320 --> 3:28:30.960]  And I wouldn't be surprised if that becomes a ticket for the White House down the road.
[3:28:30.960 --> 3:28:35.440]  You know, Kerry Lake and Tulsi Gabbard wouldn't be surprised at all or DeSantis and Kerry Lake
[3:28:35.440 --> 3:28:37.000]  or DeSantis and Tulsi Gabbard.
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:39.640]  I wouldn't be surprised at all.
[3:28:39.640 --> 3:28:40.640]  Anything can happen.
[3:28:40.640 --> 3:28:43.720]  But if we choose people with principles, we'll all be better off.
[3:28:43.720 --> 3:28:44.720]  Stay with us.
[3:28:44.720 --> 3:28:47.320]  We'll be right back with a special guest and a new interview right after this break.
[3:28:47.320 --> 3:28:56.280]  I'm Mike Adams here on infowars.com.
[3:28:56.280 --> 3:28:58.160]  Look around you.
[3:28:58.160 --> 3:29:01.800]  Everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents from their own admissions is now
[3:29:01.800 --> 3:29:02.800]  happening.
[3:29:02.800 --> 3:29:06.760]  In infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[3:29:06.760 --> 3:29:11.000]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite
[3:29:11.000 --> 3:29:16.120]  the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air.
[3:29:16.120 --> 3:29:21.000]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[3:29:21.000 --> 3:29:26.160]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[3:29:26.160 --> 3:29:30.080]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by
[3:29:30.080 --> 3:29:35.600]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[3:29:35.600 --> 3:29:36.600]  It's unsustainable.
[3:29:36.600 --> 3:29:45.120]  So please visit saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations, $5,
[3:29:45.120 --> 3:29:49.120]  $10, $500, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[3:29:49.120 --> 3:29:50.120]  I'll never give up.
[3:29:50.120 --> 3:29:52.360]  I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[3:29:52.360 --> 3:29:53.640]  Thank you for your support.
[3:29:53.640 --> 3:29:54.760]  Wouldn't be without you.

[3:32:57.000 --> 3:33:12.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:12.760 --> 3:33:19.520]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[3:33:19.520 --> 3:33:27.360]  Alex, Mike Adams, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:27.360 --> 3:33:31.800]  Welcome back, and continuing now, we're going to be joined by a special guest named John
[3:33:31.800 --> 3:33:32.800]  Wadsworth.
[3:33:32.800 --> 3:33:37.280]  He's going to be joining us here for a conversation about the spiritual revolution and spiritual
[3:33:37.280 --> 3:33:38.960]  battle for America.
[3:33:38.960 --> 3:33:44.680]  Now, I'm the founder of Brighton.com, and I'm always looking for people who get it, people
[3:33:44.680 --> 3:33:49.000]  who understand what's going on, and I found John Wadsworth posting there.
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:53.020]  His channel is called New Patriot, and I'm encouraging him to branch out to other platforms
[3:33:53.020 --> 3:33:54.520]  as well.
[3:33:54.520 --> 3:33:58.080]  He just nails it, lives in California, is joining us now from California.
[3:33:58.080 --> 3:34:00.560]  Mr. Wadsworth, welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[3:34:00.560 --> 3:34:02.120]  It's great to have you on.
[3:34:02.120 --> 3:34:03.600]  Hi, Mike.
[3:34:03.600 --> 3:34:04.800]  Thanks for having me.
[3:34:04.800 --> 3:34:05.800]  Well, absolutely.
[3:34:05.800 --> 3:34:08.000]  Look, I'm a fan of your work.
[3:34:08.000 --> 3:34:12.440]  I've been watching many of your videos, and the reason I invited you on is because you're
[3:34:12.440 --> 3:34:15.560]  a down-to-earth guy, and you totally get it.
[3:34:15.560 --> 3:34:18.000]  Let's start with some basics.
[3:34:18.000 --> 3:34:24.320]  Tell us where you think we stand right now in the world in terms of conflict, and war,
[3:34:24.320 --> 3:34:26.320]  and crisis, and lies versus truth.
[3:34:26.320 --> 3:34:29.000]  Just kind of a big picture overview, if you would, please.
[3:34:29.000 --> 3:34:30.000]  Okay.
[3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:36.960]  I think we're in World War III for starters here, so I think people need to really acknowledge
[3:34:36.960 --> 3:34:42.760]  that, and most of the people in this country are, I think, brainwashed and conditioned,
[3:34:42.760 --> 3:34:45.320]  and they're not aware of the danger that we're in.
[3:34:45.320 --> 3:34:51.920]  But even, of course, beyond the physical danger of being in World War III is a spiritual danger.
[3:34:51.920 --> 3:34:58.320]  We have, as a nation, gone way off the rails, and so, yeah, we're in it.
[3:34:58.320 --> 3:35:04.400]  We're in World War III, and America is headed for a great downsizing, I'm afraid.
[3:35:04.400 --> 3:35:06.440]  Well, I want to ask you about that.
[3:35:06.440 --> 3:35:08.400]  Now, you're based in California, correct?
[3:35:08.400 --> 3:35:10.600]  Is that where you're joining us from today?
[3:35:10.600 --> 3:35:12.800]  Yes, from rural California.
[3:35:12.800 --> 3:35:14.440]  We call it New California State out here.
[3:35:14.440 --> 3:35:20.640]  We're actually forming a new state, and not submitting any longer to just the tyranny
[3:35:20.640 --> 3:35:25.000]  and the dictatorship to stop the hook here, so that's, for us, that's also an expression
[3:35:25.000 --> 3:35:30.200]  of repentance and turning back to God, so.
[3:35:30.200 --> 3:35:31.720]  So yeah, tell us about that briefly.
[3:35:31.720 --> 3:35:35.320]  I know there's been quite an effort underway, and there are models such as Virginia and
[3:35:35.320 --> 3:35:41.280]  West Virginia throughout history, and of course, Paul Preston, I'm scheduled to interview him
[3:35:41.280 --> 3:35:42.520]  at some point here shortly.
[3:35:42.520 --> 3:35:43.520]  Oh, yeah.
[3:35:43.520 --> 3:35:47.120]  Is that the same movement that you're part of, the one that he's involved in?
[3:35:47.120 --> 3:35:49.160]  Yes, it is, yeah, yeah.
[3:35:49.160 --> 3:35:53.760]  We are following the model of West Virginia, which is a well-established model of creating
[3:35:53.760 --> 3:36:00.240]  a state from an existing state, so that's our, that's our path here.
[3:36:00.240 --> 3:36:02.680]  And do you think that that's going to succeed?
[3:36:02.680 --> 3:36:07.480]  I mean, wasn't there a ballot initiative or something that you were gathering signatures
[3:36:07.480 --> 3:36:08.480]  for?
[3:36:08.480 --> 3:36:09.480]  I forgot the details.
[3:36:09.480 --> 3:36:10.480]  Fill us in, please.
[3:36:10.480 --> 3:36:14.320]  I don't remember any ballot, we have not had a ballot initiative.
[3:36:14.320 --> 3:36:19.360]  There have been other new state attempts, but we're not following that process.
[3:36:19.360 --> 3:36:20.360]  We're following a different prop.
[3:36:20.360 --> 3:36:26.000]  Paul will tell you more about that when you interview him, but we're following the constitutional
[3:36:26.000 --> 3:36:30.200]  approach, and it's a section in the Constitution called the Admissions Clause, or the New States
[3:36:30.200 --> 3:36:31.200]  Clause.
[3:36:31.200 --> 3:36:34.120]  So that's, and it doesn't have anything to do with the ballot initiative, by the way.
[3:36:34.120 --> 3:36:38.080]  So it's interesting, but that's what we're doing.
[3:36:38.080 --> 3:36:41.720]  Are you, just last question on that, we'll move on, but are you, are you confident that
[3:36:41.720 --> 3:36:44.520]  you'll be able to achieve that success as a new state?
[3:36:44.520 --> 3:36:47.560]  And what would the new state be called, by the way?
[3:36:47.560 --> 3:36:50.240]  The new state would be called New California.
[3:36:50.240 --> 3:36:54.800]  And as West Virginia, by the way, was called New Virginia, before it was called West Virginia,
[3:36:54.800 --> 3:36:57.840]  so, and for us, failure is not an option.
[3:36:57.840 --> 3:37:02.400]  So a lot of us are just saying, we're not moving out of California.
[3:37:02.400 --> 3:37:07.000]  Our elections have been stolen here for decades, we're kind of used to it, but, and we're
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:08.440]  talking about rural California.
[3:37:08.440 --> 3:37:10.440]  So we've actually formed a government.
[3:37:10.440 --> 3:37:13.600]  We have senators and assembly people in every county.
[3:37:13.600 --> 3:37:14.720]  We have a strong presence.
[3:37:14.720 --> 3:37:19.120]  We've had a number of different constitutional conventions, and we're actually legislating
[3:37:19.120 --> 3:37:22.880]  right now and ready to govern with the restored government of California.
[3:37:22.880 --> 3:37:25.880]  But I'm sure more than we talk to Paul.
[3:37:25.880 --> 3:37:27.160]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:37:27.160 --> 3:37:28.160]  And I will.
[3:37:28.160 --> 3:37:33.440]  But the, the whole COVID fiasco, the forced lockdowns, you know, the masking that the children
[3:37:33.440 --> 3:37:38.400]  yanked out of schools, the vaccine mandates, especially even for city workers and so on.
[3:37:38.400 --> 3:37:44.280]  Did that accelerate, I'm wondering, the people embracing the idea of forming a new state?
[3:37:44.280 --> 3:37:46.960]  Oh, I think that's a catalyst.
[3:37:46.960 --> 3:37:48.120]  Yes, absolutely.
[3:37:48.120 --> 3:37:49.360]  That's a catalyst.
[3:37:49.360 --> 3:37:51.800]  So that is a gift to us.
[3:37:51.800 --> 3:37:52.960]  So yeah.
[3:37:52.960 --> 3:37:57.800]  And when they try it again, which I'm sure they will, we basically, the new California
[3:37:57.800 --> 3:37:59.840]  Patriots, we never submitted to it.
[3:37:59.840 --> 3:38:02.440]  So many were, many, some became fugitives.
[3:38:02.440 --> 3:38:08.760]  Some became persecuted, some lost their jobs, some fled the state, and some are coming back.
[3:38:08.760 --> 3:38:10.640]  So yeah, that is a catalyst.
[3:38:10.640 --> 3:38:17.360]  Well, I, I know, I, I have a great idea for the entire new California economy.
[3:38:17.360 --> 3:38:21.600]  All you have to do is manufacture all the things that California is banning, such as
[3:38:21.600 --> 3:38:29.360]  natural gas powered water heaters, full flush toilets, and of course combustion engine cars,
[3:38:29.360 --> 3:38:34.840]  like the new California stages, buy used cars from all over America, fix up the used cars,
[3:38:34.840 --> 3:38:39.720]  sell them to the West Coast California people as used vehicles with combustion engines,
[3:38:39.720 --> 3:38:41.560]  because the electric cars aren't going to be available.
[3:38:41.560 --> 3:38:44.360]  I mean, there's not enough lithium in the world.
[3:38:44.360 --> 3:38:47.880]  I tell you, the new California will have a booming economy.
[3:38:47.880 --> 3:38:48.880]  Yeah.
[3:38:48.880 --> 3:38:49.880]  Yes, it will.
[3:38:49.880 --> 3:38:51.400]  And we're looking forward to that.
[3:38:51.400 --> 3:38:52.400]  Yeah.
[3:38:52.400 --> 3:38:53.400]  Okay.
[3:38:53.400 --> 3:38:54.400]  Well, I love that.
[3:38:54.400 --> 3:38:55.400]  Oh, so let's, let's broaden our scope.
[3:38:55.400 --> 3:38:59.520]  Let's talk about all of America, because you have a really powerful message about this,
[3:38:59.520 --> 3:39:04.840]  the spiritual revolution that, that is underway and the spiritual battle that is upon us.
[3:39:04.840 --> 3:39:06.600]  Let me ask you this.
[3:39:06.600 --> 3:39:13.680]  Do how important is it that we bring God into our lives to help defeat the evil, the, the
[3:39:13.680 --> 3:39:19.280]  tyrants, because they seem to be all infested with, you know, demons and Luciferian tendencies?
[3:39:19.280 --> 3:39:21.640]  How important is this aspect of the battle?
[3:39:21.640 --> 3:39:24.480]  Oh, it's absolutely critical.
[3:39:24.480 --> 3:39:26.280]  Without God, the nation falls.
[3:39:26.280 --> 3:39:30.720]  In fact, I think we're to the point where no matter what, I think we get downsized,
[3:39:30.720 --> 3:39:32.480]  severely downsized.
[3:39:32.480 --> 3:39:33.480]  Judgment is coming.
[3:39:33.480 --> 3:39:36.800]  And as I've been saying, the acts is laid at the root.
[3:39:36.800 --> 3:39:41.760]  There are just some aspects of society, even some geographical areas that just, they're
[3:39:41.760 --> 3:39:42.760]  not going to make it.
[3:39:42.760 --> 3:39:44.280]  They're, they're just not going to make it.
[3:39:44.280 --> 3:39:49.480]  And so faith in God, and I actually, I'm a, I'm a Christian.
[3:39:49.480 --> 3:39:51.120]  I believe the Bible is God's word.
[3:39:51.120 --> 3:39:54.960]  And I guess I consider myself a paleoeclectic Christian.
[3:39:54.960 --> 3:40:00.840]  So, you know, I go to a non-denominational church, but it's all about for, for us believing
[3:40:00.840 --> 3:40:06.400]  God and his word and establishing a society that that is the foundation that it's built
[3:40:06.400 --> 3:40:07.400]  on.
[3:40:07.400 --> 3:40:09.400]  So it's critical.
[3:40:09.400 --> 3:40:13.440]  Every nation that rejects God gets judged.
[3:40:13.440 --> 3:40:18.940]  And I think we've just gone way too far in the wrong direction.
[3:40:18.940 --> 3:40:23.760]  We have embraced many of the things that other cultures in history have embraced that led
[3:40:23.760 --> 3:40:24.760]  to their downfall.
[3:40:24.760 --> 3:40:26.160]  You can pick your empire, right?
[3:40:26.160 --> 3:40:32.760]  I mean, this, this culture, this, this country now has institutionalized child sacrifice.
[3:40:32.760 --> 3:40:40.320]  And we have spirit cookers, pedophiles, groomers, that all this stuff is being institutionalized
[3:40:40.320 --> 3:40:43.280]  as a sort of state religion.
[3:40:43.280 --> 3:40:48.680]  So I approach it from this perspective, Mike, is that anthropologically that would be scientifically
[3:40:48.680 --> 3:40:50.000]  speaking, right?
[3:40:50.000 --> 3:40:54.340]  Anthropology proves it's an anthropological fact that man is a religious creature.
[3:40:54.340 --> 3:40:59.200]  So the question isn't, are we going to have Christianity or faith in God?
[3:40:59.200 --> 3:41:03.800]  The question is going to be, what is your God going to be?
[3:41:03.800 --> 3:41:05.360]  Is it going to be pedophilia?
[3:41:05.360 --> 3:41:07.100]  Is it going to be statism?
[3:41:07.100 --> 3:41:10.800]  Is it going to be LGBTQ nonsense?
[3:41:10.800 --> 3:41:12.920]  Is it going to be Marxism, Leninism?
[3:41:12.920 --> 3:41:15.880]  And this country has embraced false gods.
[3:41:15.880 --> 3:41:23.880]  And so our, what I'm about is returning to just the simple faith in God expressed in
[3:41:23.880 --> 3:41:28.600]  the Bible and following his wise plan and his simple instructions.
[3:41:28.600 --> 3:41:29.600]  Yeah.
[3:41:29.600 --> 3:41:33.520]  And you know, I'm glad you mentioned the anthropology too, because the whole history
[3:41:33.520 --> 3:41:38.400]  of anthropology proves there's no such thing as a men who can get pregnant because you
[3:41:38.400 --> 3:41:43.240]  don't find transgender fossils, by the way, there, there are no transgender chimpanzees
[3:41:43.240 --> 3:41:46.840]  and apes and primates and orangutans and all that.
[3:41:46.840 --> 3:41:49.120]  No, it's males and females folks.
[3:41:49.120 --> 3:41:50.120]  That's it.
[3:41:50.120 --> 3:41:51.120]  That's all there is.
[3:41:51.120 --> 3:41:52.120]  Everything else is delusion.
[3:41:52.120 --> 3:41:54.160]  So we, yeah, we have to get back to that.
[3:41:54.160 --> 3:41:55.920]  We've got to stop the child mutilations.
[3:41:55.920 --> 3:41:56.920]  Exactly.
[3:41:56.920 --> 3:42:00.640]  As you said, God judges the nation and you mentioned, I think depopulation.
[3:42:00.640 --> 3:42:03.840]  How bad do you think that's going to get, John?
[3:42:03.840 --> 3:42:09.400]  I think it's going to get very bad and I think it's going to affect the urbanized areas,
[3:42:09.400 --> 3:42:17.040]  which are typically your blue areas, way more severely than it is the areas of the country
[3:42:17.040 --> 3:42:20.720]  that are, say, more self-reliant and that would be the rural areas.
[3:42:20.720 --> 3:42:26.840]  So the closer people seem to be to nature and basic things like just knowing where food
[3:42:26.840 --> 3:42:28.160]  comes from, right?
[3:42:28.160 --> 3:42:33.720]  They're more connected with reality and they will fare much better.
[3:42:33.720 --> 3:42:40.520]  But even in those areas, people are headed for a rude awakening, probably this winter.
[3:42:40.520 --> 3:42:46.280]  And of course, if people continue taking these non-vaccine vaccines, which of course is,
[3:42:46.280 --> 3:42:47.280]  you know...
[3:42:47.280 --> 3:42:48.280]  Okay, John.
[3:42:48.280 --> 3:42:49.280]  Sorry to interrupt.
[3:42:49.280 --> 3:42:50.280]  We're going to go to a break, John.
[3:42:50.280 --> 3:42:52.640]  We'll be right back, folks, with more with John Wadsworth here on the Alex Jones Show.
[3:42:52.640 --> 3:42:53.640]  I'm Mike Adams.

[3:42:57.640 --> 3:43:02.640]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller, but as folks
[3:43:02.640 --> 3:43:07.320]  tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy
[3:43:07.320 --> 3:43:10.800]  it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.

[3:43:30.200 --> 3:43:31.920]  And so much of the food is debased.
[3:43:31.920 --> 3:43:37.040]  There's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses

[3:47:15.680 --> 3:47:23.680]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show with Mike Adams.
[3:47:23.680 --> 3:47:29.400]  I'm going to answer a health question for you real quickly here about iodine, then we're
[3:47:29.400 --> 3:47:34.800]  going to continue with our interview with John Wadsworth about the spiritual war in America.
[3:47:34.800 --> 3:47:39.880]  Some people have asked me what's the difference between potassium iodide and iodine such as
[3:47:39.880 --> 3:47:46.280]  what the info wars store sells, like the X3 product, folks the potassium that is in potassium
[3:47:46.280 --> 3:47:48.200]  iodide is pointless.
[3:47:48.200 --> 3:47:54.440]  The potassium doesn't offer any special protection, it's just a stable solid form that is easy
[3:47:54.440 --> 3:48:00.080]  to take, but the potassium dissociates very quickly in your stomach acid and you just
[3:48:00.080 --> 3:48:02.840]  get extra potassium that's basically inconsequential.
[3:48:02.840 --> 3:48:09.560]  The key is the iodine, and the X3 form of iodine does the exact same job, and perhaps
[3:48:09.560 --> 3:48:13.320]  even better in terms of absorption compared to potassium iodide.
[3:48:13.320 --> 3:48:17.720]  The only difference is that I think the FDA has approved certain brand names of potassium
[3:48:17.720 --> 3:48:25.800]  iodide for nuclear events, but frankly all forms of iodine have a similar effect, it's
[3:48:25.800 --> 3:48:30.480]  just a question of what form you prefer to take it in and what you can get.
[3:48:30.480 --> 3:48:36.400]  So frankly support info wars, you know, and get the liquid form, the X3, high absorbability,
[3:48:36.400 --> 3:48:42.480]  and it does the trick, and in my view it probably gets absorbed more quickly than potassium iodide,
[3:48:42.480 --> 3:48:47.320]  so I think it's a superior form, but that's just my opinion as a, you know, a food scientist
[3:48:47.320 --> 3:48:50.760]  and a health expert, you know, take it for what you will.
[3:48:50.760 --> 3:48:56.360]  All right, getting back to John Wadsworth here, by the way the government of Finland
[3:48:56.360 --> 3:49:01.640]  is now telling its own citizens to start taking iodine, so not only are we getting warnings
[3:49:01.640 --> 3:49:07.360]  from across the world from other countries, but now Finland as well, and if you're smart
[3:49:07.360 --> 3:49:09.320]  you're going to be doing this in the United States.
[3:49:09.320 --> 3:49:15.320]  Now John, thank you again for joining me, John's channel on Brightion.com is called New Patriot,
[3:49:15.320 --> 3:49:20.360]  and he's great, I've watched a lot of his videos, I'm a fan of his work.
[3:49:20.360 --> 3:49:27.200]  You talked previously about God judging the United States, kind of like Sodom and Gomorrah,
[3:49:27.200 --> 3:49:31.320]  that judgment, do you think it has already begun, or is it yet to come, what will it
[3:49:31.320 --> 3:49:33.120]  look like?
[3:49:33.120 --> 3:49:37.840]  I think it has begun, and it's manifesting in different degrees, but things are coming
[3:49:37.840 --> 3:49:45.240]  to a climax where God has different means of judging, sword, famine, pestilence and
[3:49:45.240 --> 3:49:51.200]  disease are all common things that you see throughout the biblical history, and God's
[3:49:51.200 --> 3:49:54.380]  no respecter of persons in America is no different.
[3:49:54.380 --> 3:49:57.800]  If we turn our backs on him we can expect the same thing to happen.
[3:49:57.800 --> 3:50:03.640]  That's a cause and effect, Mike, so we're just people, we're human beings, and if we
[3:50:03.640 --> 3:50:08.520]  do the same things that previous civilizations have done, and the difference I guess with
[3:50:08.520 --> 3:50:14.040]  us is that we've had more light than other countries, more revelation, even more revelation
[3:50:14.040 --> 3:50:18.120]  really, even than the nation of Israel, I mean we have the Jewish people to thank for
[3:50:18.120 --> 3:50:25.840]  our Bible, but this nation was founded like no other and we have to turn back to our roots.
[3:50:25.840 --> 3:50:33.040]  And Mike, I think that as the judgment manifests I think war is actually a big, it's a major
[3:50:33.040 --> 3:50:37.680]  part of that, I think, I really do think it is, and even during the war between the states
[3:50:37.680 --> 3:50:45.320]  in America, the Civil War, people widely recognized back then that that was God's judgment.
[3:50:45.320 --> 3:50:50.360]  It wasn't such an outlandish thought, but I think today many people, it's hard to process
[3:50:50.360 --> 3:50:53.960]  because they don't have a framework, because they don't read the whole Bible, they sort
[3:50:53.960 --> 3:50:58.040]  of have made, if they do read the Bible, maybe it's like a CliffsNotes version, but the thing
[3:50:58.040 --> 3:51:03.520]  is today about contemporary Christianity is we've scaled down the truths that are contained
[3:51:03.520 --> 3:51:09.480]  in God's Word to just sort of, you know, we keep church and the Christian life in the ecclesiastical
[3:51:09.480 --> 3:51:16.920]  world, but we don't let it touch politics or food or health or science or other things,
[3:51:16.920 --> 3:51:22.120]  but in Christianity in the first century, the Christianity that rocked the world was
[3:51:22.120 --> 3:51:26.280]  a Christianity, before they called it Christianity, they called it the way, and it was the way
[3:51:26.280 --> 3:51:29.280]  of following Jesus Christ, the way of following God.
[3:51:29.280 --> 3:51:36.560]  And Mike, I think that we're going to, people will emerge from this time of judgment, this
[3:51:36.560 --> 3:51:41.080]  would be called a remnant people, the people that actually emerge out of this will be,
[3:51:41.080 --> 3:51:47.480]  God calls them remnant people, and that's who you speak to in your messages.
[3:51:47.480 --> 3:51:52.360]  These are people that will survive, and I think it's going to be incumbent on us.
[3:51:52.360 --> 3:51:59.040]  Well, being able to identify then, the discernment has never been easier, because it used to
[3:51:59.040 --> 3:52:03.760]  be for a while, some people who maybe they didn't believe in God or they were atheists,
[3:52:03.760 --> 3:52:08.560]  but they used to be, many of them still sort of polite members of a polite society and
[3:52:08.560 --> 3:52:14.280]  they would get along, but now they're just demons, they're like goblins, like child
[3:52:14.280 --> 3:52:19.520]  mutilating goblins, and they celebrate it and they love it, and they even have all this
[3:52:19.520 --> 3:52:24.160]  out picturing and so on, just showing the demonism all over their faces and with their
[3:52:24.160 --> 3:52:30.040]  hair and body alterations and everything, and they even sound like demons as they're
[3:52:30.040 --> 3:52:33.480]  bragging about how they're exploiting and mutilating children.
[3:52:33.480 --> 3:52:38.480]  So it's never been easier to tell the difference, would you agree?
[3:52:38.480 --> 3:52:43.680]  I totally agree with that, it's manifesting everywhere, and you know, I could point something
[3:52:43.680 --> 3:52:48.640]  out too, Mike, we were talking about this yesterday, is that the famous Soviet defector
[3:52:48.640 --> 3:52:57.000]  Yuri Besmanov revealed the strategy of taking down America, and it was a communist subversion
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:53:03.800]  plot that involved first demoralization, and that means removing the morals from a society,
[3:53:03.800 --> 3:53:08.160]  making it completely moral less, and this is what we've done, you know, Vladimir Putin
[3:53:08.160 --> 3:53:13.640]  actually pointed it out, is that we have a country now where those who worship Satan
[3:53:13.640 --> 3:53:20.520]  are unequal footing with those who worship God, you know, and then the other two main
[3:53:20.520 --> 3:53:25.520]  steps that Yuri Besmanov talked about, he says these things would occur prior to the
[3:53:25.520 --> 3:53:29.440]  take down of America, one was that there would be a crisis, and he said this could be brought
[3:53:29.440 --> 3:53:34.160]  about in a matter of weeks, I think he said, and then normalization, that going through
[3:53:34.160 --> 3:53:39.520]  this crisis, everything would be normalized, but see all this happens, the backdrop for
[3:53:39.520 --> 3:53:44.760]  all of this is a society without morals.
[3:53:44.760 --> 3:53:50.560]  So when you say demoralization, you're talking about the removal of morals from society,
[3:53:50.560 --> 3:53:55.360]  not kind of like battlefield morale where people have courage, you're talking about
[3:53:55.360 --> 3:54:01.000]  eliminating morals, I think that interpretation is exactly correct, yeah, go ahead.
[3:54:01.000 --> 3:54:06.240]  Yeah, no, I think that is it, you know, when he said that, I first thought he meant like
[3:54:06.240 --> 3:54:12.240]  discouraging society, but demoralization of society, remember his mother tongue was Russian,
[3:54:12.240 --> 3:54:17.520]  and I think it means removing, it's an amoral society, and that is really what we've become.
[3:54:17.520 --> 3:54:24.440]  And anytime in this culture, when you express an opinion that's rooted in moral truth, timeless
[3:54:24.440 --> 3:54:30.920]  moral principles, eternal principles, people will look at you as if, well, that's just
[3:54:30.920 --> 3:54:38.240]  your opinion, and as if an opposite opinion, which completely the wrong direction, worshiping
[3:54:38.240 --> 3:54:44.160]  Satan, for instance, is of equal value or equally true somehow, that's kind of where
[3:54:44.160 --> 3:54:45.160]  we are.
[3:54:45.160 --> 3:54:50.560]  No, if you say, yeah, you shouldn't use scalpels to mutilate children and slice off the breasts
[3:54:50.560 --> 3:54:55.960]  and genitals, and then the leftists will say, well, that's just your view, no, that's the
[3:54:55.960 --> 3:55:01.240]  correct view, you don't mutilate children for profit and call it progress.
[3:55:01.240 --> 3:55:03.760]  I mean, come on.
[3:55:03.760 --> 3:55:04.760]  That's the reality.
[3:55:04.760 --> 3:55:09.160]  And, you know, and one of the other things that Yuri Besman predicted, he says when the
[3:55:09.160 --> 3:55:15.880]  society gets this far in the process of being ready for a communist takeover, let me see
[3:55:15.880 --> 3:55:20.720]  what he was talking about, is that when they're demoralized, when there are no morals left,
[3:55:20.720 --> 3:55:27.680]  he said it doesn't matter how many facts you present to people, they simply will not receive
[3:55:27.680 --> 3:55:28.680]  them.
[3:55:28.680 --> 3:55:32.480]  And in logic, they're incapable of processing.
[3:55:32.480 --> 3:55:38.280]  Once demoralization has occurred in a society, they're incapable of recognizing truth.
[3:55:38.280 --> 3:55:40.040]  Well, that's exactly where we are.
[3:55:40.040 --> 3:55:45.040]  And it's funny because this came out in Putin's recent speech, talking about how the West
[3:55:45.040 --> 3:55:50.040]  has become essentially a satanic or an anti-Christ civilization in his view, and he was talking
[3:55:50.040 --> 3:55:56.080]  about how Russia feels like they can't negotiate, they can't communicate with the West because
[3:55:56.080 --> 3:56:00.880]  the West is run by these lunatics that just, I mean, what do you do?
[3:56:00.880 --> 3:56:05.880]  It's kind of like arguing with a leftist about something like, you know, if they claim men
[3:56:05.880 --> 3:56:10.120]  can get pregnant and you're like, that's insane, that's stupid, of course, men can't
[3:56:10.120 --> 3:56:14.520]  get pregnant, but then they will, they will believe it no matter what, they will defend
[3:56:14.520 --> 3:56:21.320]  their insanity because, well, I mean, let's face it, they're infested with demonic influence
[3:56:21.320 --> 3:56:22.320]  at this point.
[3:56:22.320 --> 3:56:25.760]  But John, we're about to wrap up this segment with you.
[3:56:25.760 --> 3:56:31.240]  What are your final thoughts of what people should do to help save America from this demonic
[3:56:31.240 --> 3:56:32.240]  downfall?
[3:56:32.240 --> 3:56:37.400]  Okay, so I think people, first of all, is turn back to God.
[3:56:37.400 --> 3:56:42.400]  And there's not a real formula for that because it's got to be very sincere, but it starts
[3:56:42.400 --> 3:56:48.280]  with prayer and repentance, just God, please forgive me, please forgive our nation for our
[3:56:48.280 --> 3:56:50.600]  sins and show me what I need to do.
[3:56:50.600 --> 3:56:54.080]  Lord, what should I do to be part of the solution here?
[3:56:54.080 --> 3:56:55.520]  It starts with that.
[3:56:55.520 --> 3:57:00.480]  And like I said, God's got a wise plan and he's got simple instructions.
[3:57:00.480 --> 3:57:04.760]  I encourage people to get involved in some sort of a local, you know, fellowship.
[3:57:04.760 --> 3:57:09.560]  And of course, if you're in New California, I just urge you to join what we're doing here.
[3:57:09.560 --> 3:57:16.720]  We want, we listen, guys, life is still worth defending, freedom is still worth defending
[3:57:16.720 --> 3:57:20.720]  and giving up is unthinkable, but we need to be on God's side.
[3:57:20.720 --> 3:57:22.240]  We don't ask God to be on our side.
[3:57:22.240 --> 3:57:23.320]  We need to be on his side.
[3:57:23.320 --> 3:57:25.040]  I think that's where we start here, Mike.
[3:57:25.040 --> 3:57:26.040]  All right.
[3:57:26.040 --> 3:57:27.040]  Well said.
[3:57:27.040 --> 3:57:31.600]  John Wadsworth, known as New Patriot, folks, if you want to check out his channel on Brighttown.com,
[3:57:31.600 --> 3:57:34.480]  and I'm sure you'll be posting elsewhere as well.
[3:57:34.480 --> 3:57:35.480]  It's great to have you on today.
[3:57:35.480 --> 3:57:38.880]  Thank you for joining me and thank all of you for watching today.
[3:57:38.880 --> 3:57:42.600]  Liveinfowars.com to help donate to keep this platform on the air.
[3:57:42.600 --> 3:57:44.160]  I'm Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[3:57:44.160 --> 3:57:45.160]  Thank you for watching today.
[3:57:45.160 --> 3:57:46.160]  God bless.
[3:57:46.160 --> 3:57:51.160]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalist.
[3:57:51.160 --> 3:57:57.360]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but to the
[3:57:57.360 --> 3:57:58.360]  world.
[3:57:58.360 --> 3:58:04.040]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[3:58:04.040 --> 3:58:05.040]  deserve the credit.
[3:58:05.040 --> 3:58:09.840]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who've supported InfoWars are the
[3:58:09.840 --> 3:58:12.520]  real reason you've had the success.
[3:58:12.520 --> 3:58:16.920]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever
