[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistants.
[00:26.000 --> 00:36.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:41.000 --> 00:44.000]  We are going in through and beyond.
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  We are now inside the operational phase of the New World Order.
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.000]  Thank you for joining us for this live Sunday, September 25th, 2022, transmission.
[00:54.000 --> 01:00.000]  We have a very special guest joining us in studio in the second hour.
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.000]  Probably one of the most powerful individuals when it comes to exposing the truth about COVID.
[01:05.000 --> 01:11.000]  Dr. Judy Mikovits will be joining us in studio coming up tonight in the second hour
[01:11.000 --> 01:19.000]  than Owen Schreuer, Steve Bannon, and more in Sunday Live, 6 to 8 p.m. Central Standard Time this evening.
[01:19.000 --> 01:27.000]  All hell's breaking loose, like they say, and we have got an incredible broadcast lined up for you.
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  We have drag queen pedophile story times happening all over the U.S., including Texas,
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  where the children don't just put money in the G-strings of the individuals,
[01:37.000 --> 01:40.000]  the men dressed up like women, or hit the clown,
[01:40.000 --> 01:46.000]  but they then spread their legs in the children's face and the children grabbed their crotchets.
[01:46.000 --> 01:54.000]  You tie that together with the teacher up in Canada with a giant 50XD fake breast in front of the students.
[01:54.000 --> 02:04.000]  I mean, this is just a pure exercise in conditioning us to accept hell on earth, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  We've got huge nuclear war news, we've got huge economic collapse news,
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.000]  but I think that front and center shows you why we're becoming a cursed nation and a cursed planet.
[02:13.000 --> 02:19.000]  We have huge economic news, billionaire investor Carl Eichen warns the worst is yet to come
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.000]  for investors and compares U.S. inflation to the fall of the Roman Empire.
[02:23.000 --> 02:29.000]  EU farmers warned of food shortages, Reuters, it's all being done by design.
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  Meanwhile, electric cars are blowing up at record rates across not just the U.S.,
[02:33.000 --> 02:41.000]  but the world and burning down buildings, a new great issue being caused by these driving fire bombs.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  That's okay because they're liberal.
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  And the wheels have completely come off the vaccine poison.
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  We'll talk about that next hour with the doctor in studio.
[02:49.000 --> 02:56.000]  FDA vaccine advisor on the vaccine panel says children should not take the injections.
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  So much more on that front.
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.000]  We told you about this two weeks ago.
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  Now it's mainstream news.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  Israeli investors, investigators, excuse me,
[03:05.000 --> 03:12.000]  have defined COVID-19 vaccines cause deadly side effects in leaked government documents and video.
[03:12.000 --> 03:19.000]  New York to sunset forced injections and so much more on that front coming up tonight.
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  And of course we have the huge Russia news, World War three update,
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  massive troop movements inside Russia.
[03:26.000 --> 03:34.000]  National draft called up Finland shuts borders with Russia as military aged men try to flee Russia for Finland.
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.000]  As they say, all hell is breaking loose.
[03:38.000 --> 03:48.000]  The Democrats are in full panic mode as more and more of their even skewed polls that select and sample 15% to 10% more Democrats in their poll
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.000]  still show Republican landslides everywhere.
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  That also has the system with its hair on fire.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  We'll be covering so much here tonight.
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  So many critical issues on so many fronts.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  Please remember the way we get past the sensors and the big tech blockade is you.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  You've been doing an incredible job.
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  So share the links for info wars.com,
[04:12.000 --> 04:26.000]  forward slash show and band video and share the live show link right on the front page dealing with the massively positive news with Italy's first female leader set to be elected.
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.000]  That's why the Atlantic Monthly and other globalist organs are truly fascist are calling her a fascist.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  Mussolini returns to power as a woman.
[04:34.000 --> 04:44.000]  They're saying because she's against Klaus Schwab and the IMF and the World Bank and other patriots are being elected all over the world because humanity is awakening and fighting back.
[04:44.000 --> 04:53.000]  The return of fascism in Italy as Italians and Romans climbed the EU buildings and UN buildings and stripped down their globalist flags.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  Humanity is rising.
[04:55.000 --> 05:01.000]  We'll be back. Stay with us.

[06:53.000 --> 06:54.000]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[06:54.000 --> 07:01.000]  I'm very honored and blessed and pleased and fortunate to be here with you live on this Sunday transmission.
[07:01.000 --> 07:07.000]  We're only here because of the good races and incredible steadfast support and prayer at word of mouth.
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  You've given us broadcast.
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  This truly is your transmission.
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  And I salute and thank you.
[07:13.000 --> 07:15.000]  Okay.
[07:15.000 --> 07:23.000]  We have a massive global political realignment against the new world order against the corporate fascist and their leftist mobs.
[07:23.000 --> 07:31.000]  And we see a first woman president of Italy, who the poll show just got elected.
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  Maloney on the cusp of power.
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  Italy shifts right.
[07:35.000 --> 07:37.000]  And we have Atlantic.
[07:37.000 --> 07:44.000]  Monthly, the folks owned by Steve Jobs, his wife, who constantly hangs out at Epstein Island.
[07:44.000 --> 07:54.000]  They're saying the return of fascism in Italy is they don't like 900% increases in their fuel and natural gas,
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.000]  because they don't like ongoing COVID lockdowns.
[07:58.000 --> 08:04.000]  They've elected someone extremely critical of Klaus Schwab and the new world order.
[08:04.000 --> 08:14.000]  And all over Italy, in Rome and in Naples and in many other areas, the population went into UN compounds and pulled down UN flags
[08:14.000 --> 08:20.000]  and pulled down European flags wherever they could be seen or EU globalist flags.
[08:20.000 --> 08:27.000]  So the public understands that this is a globalist operation and they're taking their country back.
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  And the same thing is happening in Sweden.
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  And the same thing is happening in Brazil.
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  The same thing is happening in Canada.
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.000]  The new conservative leader, who they held the election today, would beat Trudeau by 40 points.
[08:41.000 --> 08:47.000]  He would be the new leader of Canada, is completely anti-new world order, and they call him Alex Jones.
[08:47.000 --> 08:56.000]  Their press calls him Alex Jones, because he sounds just like me, because he's covering the same real issues of the globalist and the Great Reset
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  and how to stop them.
[08:58.000 --> 09:06.000]  Everywhere, humanity is awakening and on the march and the corrupt globalist empire, monopoly empire, is on the run.
[09:06.000 --> 09:15.000]  The problem is they still have the money and the power and they're launching everything they've got, ladies and gentlemen, against us.
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.000]  So things are very negative, things are very dark, things are very dangerous.
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  There's Newtonian physics documents for every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  So as long as we don't give up and keep fighting, we will win.
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  We have to.
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  We absolutely have to.
[09:33.000 --> 09:43.000]  And now the head of the European Union, the unelected bureaucracy, that was just a steel agreement in 1956, is threatening sanctions on Italy
[09:43.000 --> 09:50.000]  if they try to block any of the EU edicts like cutting off the carbon or shutting down the farms.
[09:50.000 --> 09:57.000]  But you see the resistance rising in the Netherlands and rising in the UK and rising in Canada and rising in the US.
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  Polls out absolutely panic with Democrats.
[10:01.000 --> 10:10.000]  Again, even though the average mainline establishment polls samples 10 to 15% more Democrats just standing there more Democrats, which isn't true.
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  Self-fulfilling prophecy.
[10:12.000 --> 10:24.000]  Despite that, new national polls show Republicans across the board in the lead in the key races that will be upon us in 44 days with the midterms.
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.000]  Democrats see red after latest major poll flips the narrative.
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.000]  We're going to be getting to that as well tonight.
[10:32.000 --> 10:39.000]  But really, as I look at all these giant issues, the most important is the economic war against the people.
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.000]  The open attack on our children, we're going to be getting to.
[10:44.000 --> 10:59.000]  And the situation with looming expanded escalated war in Ukraine as the United States and NATO are officially in a war with Russia and Russia is losing.
[10:59.000 --> 11:10.000]  And so Russia is conscripting and launching the national draft and moving heavy weapons in to begin not a special police action or special military action,
[11:10.000 --> 11:18.000]  but a full on bombardment and war of scorched earth and leveling areas until their opposition is defeated.
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.000]  Russia is toe to toe with NATO in the United States.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  Russia is toe to toe with weapons 30 years in advance and what they have.
[11:25.000 --> 11:34.000]  And if they continue to press things, I believe Putin's going to see this latest assault repelled.
[11:34.000 --> 11:41.000]  And then Putin's doctrinal directives are to use tactical nuclear weapons.
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.000]  And the Pentagon is threatening all out nuclear war.
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.000]  And so as Putin, Putin is saying, I'm not bluffing.
[11:48.000 --> 11:58.000]  So truly nuclear, thermonuclear Russian roulette is where we are tonight.
[11:58.000 --> 12:15.000]  So be sure to say your prayers and have your children say their prayers when you get tucked in at night because the world has never, never, ever, ever been in more danger of a thermal nuclear war.
[12:15.000 --> 12:23.000]  So just let that sink in and think about that because that's where we are right now.
[12:23.000 --> 12:31.000]  Now, I want to hit really the news that is the most incredible.
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  I think nuclear war is the most important.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  Economic collapse feeds into that.
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  It's all part of the Great Reset.
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.000]  But this particular stack of news is just super positive.
[12:41.000 --> 12:49.000]  Sure, it confirms some really horrible things, but at the same time, at least it's coming out.
[12:49.000 --> 13:05.000]  And to say that the official COVID narrative collapsed around the first of the year, eight months ago, nine months ago, to say that it collapsed is an understatement.
[13:05.000 --> 13:18.000]  Now the official story hasn't just disintegrated, but it is super charging whistleblowers at the highest levels of the biomedical cartel to realize what they've done.
[13:18.000 --> 13:31.000]  Those that weren't conscious of it or fully in bed with it to have them engage in an exodus away from big tech and away from big pharma and away from the deep state globalist that launched this attack.
[13:31.000 --> 13:38.000]  So FDA advisory group rejects COVID boosters for most limits to high risk groups.
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.000]  But remember that got overridden because they fired the panel.
[13:41.000 --> 13:47.000]  But even members of the new panel have come out and said we need to stop taking these shots.
[13:47.000 --> 13:55.000]  They don't work and they hurt people, particularly young people with massive microcarditis that has exploded off the charts.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  We're going to be covering that next segment.
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  And just remember, this is life-saving hardcore information.
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  You have been vindicated when you told the troops at Thanksgiving and your family attacked you.
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  You've been vindicated when you called in to talk radio and people attacked you.
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  You've been vindicated when you went to city council or school council and warned against these shots.
[14:15.000 --> 14:25.000]  You've been vindicated as a nurse or a firefighter or in the military when you refused to take the injection and got sanctioned or fired or jailed in some cases.
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  And so now you should be angry.
[14:29.000 --> 14:42.000]  You should be upright and you should be not doing a victory lap but saying we were right so we can then expose and prosecute and bring to justice the people that have committed the greatest crime in history.
[14:42.000 --> 14:48.000]  When all said and done, these so-called shots are going to kill more people than Mao Zedong, Hitler and Stalin combined.
[14:48.000 --> 14:54.000]  The death rate just two years into this is off the charts.
[14:54.000 --> 15:00.000]  But if they could normalize killing us and get away with this, they're going to release a new virus, have new lockdowns and do it again.
[15:00.000 --> 15:09.000]  So it's a life and death situation to stop the globalist agenda, deadness, tracks to understand this, to let it sink in and then get it out there.
[15:09.000 --> 15:20.000]  Because they just hope, okay, people don't trust us, people stop taking the shot as I reported a week ago, a 99% reduction in folks taking the poison shots around the world.
[15:20.000 --> 15:28.000]  So we've got victory but we're all isolated as individuals feeling alone not realizing that almost everybody agrees with us.
[15:28.000 --> 15:35.000]  Now you got to go rally in the town square, you got to call talk radio, you got to go visit Congress, you got to speak up, you got to go confront your doctor,
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  confront the school board and say you were wrong and you've been exposed.
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.000]  They want to just creep off and have us forget about it so they can then power up and slug us again.
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  No, we go on the offense.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  That's what we do.
[15:49.000 --> 15:55.000]  We have them by the short hairs right now, we press the attack.
[15:55.000 --> 16:00.000]  Stay well as we hit this new straight ahead, info wars dot com.
[16:00.000 --> 16:05.000]  Info wars work has never been having a bigger effect than it's having right now.
[16:05.000 --> 16:08.000]  And today is do or die time.

[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  I've put everything into it.
[16:24.000 --> 16:25.000]  I'm leaving it on the field.

[17:48.000 --> 17:59.000]  These are normal biological actions that come in together.
[17:59.000 --> 17:58.000]  They really are sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that will domesticate us and turn us into lab rats.

[20:53.000 --> 20:56.000]  Why don't we talk about cryptocurrency?
[20:56.000 --> 21:05.000]  Because one of the ways that you encourage your audience to give you money is in cryptocurrency donations, right?
[21:05.000 --> 21:06.000]  Yes.
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.000]  And you have a page on your website that's just for cryptocurrency donations, right?
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  infowarstore.com.

[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  Well, we're fighting the deep state. We need money.

[21:40.000 --> 21:44.000]  We'll just keep, we'll just keep minting money as you're in this courtroom.
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  Let's move on.
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  People care about the first amendment.
[21:55.000 --> 21:59.000]  The new world order is trying to break your will to drive you to submission.
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  They think they can do it.
[22:01.000 --> 22:05.000]  But believe me, I know you're strong and I bet on you we're going to win.
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  I've only begun to fight.
[22:08.000 --> 22:12.000]  You see the attacks we're under, but I know we're going to win in the end.
[22:12.000 --> 22:15.000]  So I thank you for your support.
[22:15.000 --> 22:22.000]  Don and Judy Mikovits exposed Fauci more than 15 years ago versus criminal activity.
[22:22.000 --> 22:25.000]  She is the most fiery, focused person out there fighting.
[22:25.000 --> 22:29.000]  She's in studio with us in the second hour.
[22:29.000 --> 22:32.000]  And I wanted to talk about what's now come out.
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  The rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[22:34.000 --> 22:40.000]  They had to appoint three different FDA boards to get approval for the experimental shot.
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  The first board had to be removed because they wouldn't.
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  The next board approved it.
[22:45.000 --> 22:49.000]  The next board wouldn't approve boosters for children or old people.
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  They said it would hurt them.
[22:51.000 --> 22:54.000]  They were removed.
[22:54.000 --> 23:02.000]  Then another board wouldn't approve it for six months up, six month old babies.
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.000]  They got removed.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  That's three boards removed.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  They're on their fourth board.
[23:07.000 --> 23:16.000]  And now multiple members of the fourth board, three boards removed,
[23:16.000 --> 23:21.000]  say young people shouldn't be taking the new booster shot,
[23:21.000 --> 23:25.000]  because it's clearly causing heart attacks and microcarditis that you see everywhere.
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.000]  And they now admit it's multi-thousand percentage points up.
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  We have the latest numbers from insurance companies.
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.000]  The numbers that are officially out with the government are almost a year old,
[23:35.000 --> 23:40.000]  and they show a huge percentage increase,
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  but not as high as what the insurance company numbers show.
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.000]  The insurance company numbers are about a month old,
[23:47.000 --> 23:50.000]  not a year and a half old, like federal numbers.
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  Here's the headline.
[23:52.000 --> 23:58.000]  A daily mail FDA vaccine advisor says healthy young people shouldn't get another COVID booster.
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  And he's on the main board.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  And others are going public.
[24:02.000 --> 24:07.000]  So I'm going to go ahead and play a clip of FDA vaccine advisor
[24:07.000 --> 24:11.000]  who warns healthy young people should not get the new COVID booster.
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.000]  Are we going to allow distribution of the Moderna vaccine for everybody over 18,
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  of the Pfizer vaccine for everybody over 12?
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  And what I fear is that they're going to say everybody should get it
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.000]  when in fact a healthy young person really is unlikely to benefit from a booster dose.
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.000]  And so I hope they target it more specifically to those really who are most likely
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  to benefit from this additional dose.
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  No, because right now as it stands, if you are 50 and over,
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.000]  if you have a preexisting condition, yes, you could be eligible.
[24:37.000 --> 24:40.000]  But otherwise, as you point out, younger people are not.
[24:40.000 --> 24:45.000]  If it is in fact authorized, Pfizer would be authorized for 12 and up as you point out.
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  Moderna 18 and up.
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.000]  Why not get it?
[24:48.000 --> 24:49.000]  Right?
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  If it does give you, even if it's a smaller benefit,
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  is there any reason not to get the booster?
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.000]  I think when you're asking people to get a vaccine,
[24:57.000 --> 25:01.000]  I think there has to be clear evidence of benefit and we're not going to have clinical studies
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.000]  obviously before this launches, but you'd like to have at least human data.
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  People, you know, getting this vaccine, you see a clear and dramatic increase
[25:08.000 --> 25:09.000]  in neutralizing antibodies.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  And then at least you have a correlate of protection against VA4 or VA5.
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  Because if you don't have that, if there's not clear evidence of benefit,
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  then it's not fair, I think, for people to take a risk,
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.000]  no matter how well the benefit should be clear.
[25:24.000 --> 25:25.000]  You know what this is called.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  It's called CYA.
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.000]  Cover your ass.
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  The lie is it's a vaccine.
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  It's a gene therapy.
[25:35.000 --> 25:36.000]  It doesn't protect you.
[25:36.000 --> 25:37.000]  It raises your immune system.
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.000]  It doesn't help old people either, but they can plausibly cover up old people dying.
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.000]  They can't when a bunch of two-year-olds and six-year-olds and nine-year-olds
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  and 12-year-olds are dying.
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  And 16-year-old tennis players and football players, they can't cover that up.
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  So they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[25:55.000 --> 25:56.000]  Let's not give it to kids.
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  Let's just kill the old people.
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.000]  Now let's go to a clip here of Dr. Reimer Fulmick.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  There's also a lawyer busy with hundreds of top lawyers
[26:08.000 --> 26:14.000]  suing and getting the documents exposing this where he lays out what's really going on.
[26:14.000 --> 26:17.000]  Total number of pulmonary embolism reports by year.
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.000]  This jumped from 2020 to 2021.
[26:21.000 --> 26:26.000]  And this is only partial 2021 by 260.4%.
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  Or if you look at the total number of, what is this,
[26:30.000 --> 26:36.000]  acute myocardial infarctinoborus by year from 2020 to 2021,
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.000]  probably, I don't know, six, seven months into 2021,
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.000]  the number jumped by 343.5%.
[26:43.000 --> 26:48.000]  These and what we're talking about is young people between the ages of 18 to 35 or so,
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  very fit young soldiers who this shouldn't happen to them.
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  But this is what is going to blow them out of the water,
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.000]  because these are numbers that cannot be explained by anything other than it's the vaccines that are doing,
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  the so-called vaccines that are doing the damage.
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.000]  So I think this is what's getting everyone's attention, including the courts of law.
[27:07.000 --> 27:10.000]  Okay, so what's next now to make this thing fly and to make it go?
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.000]  Well, I do have to stay here in Germany for a couple more weeks, probably.
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  I wish I could have left a lot earlier, but I can't.
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  There's a few things I have to take care of.
[27:20.000 --> 27:26.000]  But I am in the meantime speaking with my colleagues in the US who are much more experienced.
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  They have much more courtroom experience than I do.
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  My courtroom experience, most of it is in German courts.
[27:31.000 --> 27:38.000]  So this is a group of lawyers who are now ready and willing to go forward with a really big case,
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.000]  probably not just one class action or attempt at a class action, but many.
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.000]  Because if you look at the different groups of people of the different classes,
[27:46.000 --> 27:52.000]  you may want to distinguish between those who suffer physical damage because of the so-called vaccines
[27:52.000 --> 27:58.000]  and others who suffer economic damages because their businesses were destroyed or they lost their livelihoods.
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.000]  So there may be many different class actions, hopefully very many.
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  But the first step is always the most important one.
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.000]  Once you get started and once you get a court of law to look at the evidence,
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.000]  then it's going to be much easier for others to follow in those footsteps.
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  It's going to make headlines pretty much all over the world, including in Germany.
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  It's always been like this because when Germany didn't want to go after Deutsche Bank for its fraudulent loans
[28:21.000 --> 28:27.000]  or VW for its diesel scandal, they kept waiting and waiting and waiting, the judiciary did.
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.000]  And then finally, the American judiciary showed them the way.
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.000]  They couldn't ignore the evidence that was collected by American courts of law.
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  So once again.
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.000]  And remember, only a fraction of people getting sick is being reported.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  Most folks are undiagnosed.
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  They say maybe 1% of the adverse effects get reported.
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  So we're talking almost 100 times whatever we're hearing.
[28:48.000 --> 28:49.000]  This is incredible.
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.000]  We have Peter McCullough weighing in on this and the other side.
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  And so much more. Please stay with us.
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  Why don't we talk about cryptocurrency?
[29:03.000 --> 29:09.000]  Because one of the ways that you encourage your audience to give you money
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  is in cryptocurrency donations, right?
[29:11.000 --> 29:12.000]  Yes.
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.000]  And you have a page on your website that's just for crypto currency donations, right?
[29:16.000 --> 29:19.000]  infowords.com.4 slash crypto.
[29:19.000 --> 29:21.000]  Is that a little advertisement just there?
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  Well, we're fighting the deep state. We need money.
[29:23.000 --> 29:24.000]  All right.
[29:24.000 --> 29:25.000]  This is it.
[29:25.000 --> 29:28.000]  Give crypto fun info wars.
[29:28.000 --> 29:32.000]  Sponsor us with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, right?
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight.
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.000]  Your advertiser's brand of cryptocurrency page.
[29:37.000 --> 29:42.000]  You know, I mean, I mean, people want to keep us in the fight.
[29:42.000 --> 29:46.000]  So I mean, I hope wherever the big whales are, they'll give us money before it gets done.
[29:46.000 --> 29:50.000]  We'll just keep, we'll just keep minting money as you're in this courtroom.
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  All right, let's move on.
[29:52.000 --> 29:55.000]  People care about the First Amendment.
[29:55.000 --> 30:04.000]  Your voice counts.
[30:04.000 --> 30:09.000]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[30:09.000 --> 30:12.000]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[30:12.000 --> 30:13.000]  They know you're angry.
[30:13.000 --> 30:18.000]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[31:51.000 --> 31:59.000]  Super Blue being sold out for more than a year and a half, finally back available at infowarstore.com.
[31:59.000 --> 32:05.000]  It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year, and I believe the most powerful.
[32:05.000 --> 32:10.000]  The man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[32:10.000 --> 32:14.000]  The citizen of a republic. The man in the arena.
[32:14.000 --> 32:20.000]  There's only 10,000 of this coin and it exists in the world. It will never be made again.
[32:20.000 --> 32:26.000]  It's not just an amazing historic coin. It funds the information war against the globalist.
[32:26.000 --> 32:30.000]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren. This is something you want to own.
[32:30.000 --> 32:36.000]  And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war against the globalist.
[32:36.000 --> 32:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available. They'll sell out very quickly.
[32:40.000 --> 32:43.000]  Please be part of history and thank you all for your support.
[32:43.000 --> 32:50.000]  You can go to 1776coin.com or you can go to patreoncollectibles.com and secure this coin.
[32:50.000 --> 32:55.000]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence and it funds the info war.
[32:55.000 --> 33:00.000]  Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt, 1776coin.com.
[33:00.000 --> 33:29.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:31.000 --> 33:38.000]  Yeah, I want to comment. Edward Dowd is a billionaire. He's a former BlackRock manager who's come out.
[33:38.000 --> 33:43.000]  He's been the first big guy in Wall Street to come out and said basically Pfizer defrauded the government.
[33:43.000 --> 33:50.000]  It's clear now, all the insurance companies are showing anybody who takes the vaccine much higher risk of death over the next year.
[33:50.000 --> 33:54.000]  The insurance companies are blowing up with deaths all over, especially in young people.
[33:54.000 --> 34:00.000]  Just yesterday, the millennial generation, the mortality is way up.
[34:00.000 --> 34:03.000]  The vaccine accelerates death from other causes.
[34:03.000 --> 34:06.000]  So if someone has cancer, the vaccine accelerates that.
[34:06.000 --> 34:11.000]  If someone has heart disease, one's more likely to have fatal heart attacks and strokes.
[34:11.000 --> 34:17.000]  The blood clotting is undeniable. The vaccines cause blood clotting, which is a common cause of final death.
[34:17.000 --> 34:24.000]  Large blood clot travels longer. In the brain, Justin Bieber's wife had a blood clot in the brain. All the athletes dying on the field.
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.000]  You can see it all over. The vaccine is incredibly risky.
[34:28.000 --> 34:35.000]  Basically, it's achieving its goal. If the goal was to reduce the world's population, it's working.
[34:35.000 --> 34:42.000]  Now, it's not been long enough to see the impact of the vaccine on fertility, but that's the next shoe to drop.
[34:42.000 --> 34:48.000]  That's Dr. Peter McCullough. A year and a half ago, off record, he said, that's clearly what the evidence showed,
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.000]  but he wasn't ready to say it on air. We were, because we had the information.
[34:51.000 --> 34:59.000]  But now, a mainline guy that's run major FDA trials for the government, a cardiologist, is saying what we all know.
[34:59.000 --> 35:03.000]  So think about the people that run things that did this by design.
[35:03.000 --> 35:10.000]  We had the FDA documents, the CDC documents in October of 2020 before the shots began predicting the heart attacks,
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  the microcreditus, the blood clots, the strokes, all of it.
[35:14.000 --> 35:19.000]  Remember, that's who we're dealing with. That's what they think of us.
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.000]  They literally want to kill us.
[35:22.000 --> 35:28.000]  And even I, when I say that, had trouble wrapping my mind around it because you're not like that.
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  I'm not like that, but they are like that.
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.000]  You got to let that sink in. You got to face that hard truth. You got to understand it.
[35:36.000 --> 35:43.000]  And then if you work for the system and have been going along with it, be like all these FDA board members that have quit or been fired.
[35:43.000 --> 35:48.000]  Now they're up to their fourth board and they got members come out against them. They'll fire that board.
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.000]  Come out and speak out. Don't be part.
[35:52.000 --> 36:01.000]  Don't aid and abet the depopulation of your fellow humans for these globalists at BlackRock, like Larry Fink that are running this whole thing.
[36:01.000 --> 36:07.000]  In fact, we're going to run a clip of him talking about the drastic measures that are needed for the Great Reset.
[36:07.000 --> 36:14.000]  He says the exact same things that Prince Charles a year ago, now King Charles III,
[36:14.000 --> 36:23.000]  set a global military operation with more funds than exists on the planet to carry out the Great Reset
[36:23.000 --> 36:30.000]  and shutting off all carbon, which he knows will kill billions and billions of people.
[36:30.000 --> 36:36.000]  The outlawing of carbon that we're literally made up of. This is so incredibly obvious.
[36:36.000 --> 36:41.000]  So again, it's not about spiking the football. It's not about doing an in-zone dance.
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.000]  It's not about going, whoa, we were right. You were wrong. It's about, man, I wish we weren't right.
[36:46.000 --> 36:54.000]  And those of you that criticized us and censored us at Big Tech, you know you're complicit in this.
[36:54.000 --> 37:00.000]  You're going to keep doubling down even as the rats leave the sinking ship? I said this over two years ago.
[37:00.000 --> 37:07.000]  I said, when it comes out, it gives you cancer and causes heart attacks, because they already tested this stuff before they knew what it did.
[37:07.000 --> 37:15.000]  When it comes out what the spike protein does, it'll cause civilizational collapse if we don't prosecute who did it.
[37:15.000 --> 37:21.000]  It'll be a total break, total discrediting of the medical system, total discrediting of the government,
[37:21.000 --> 37:31.000]  all the infrastructure, a breaking of the social agreement, the social contract, which is the Klaus Schwab plan if you read his books.
[37:31.000 --> 37:38.000]  See, they think that they can carry all this out and not get in trouble for what they've done.
[37:38.000 --> 37:45.000]  As long as they've got plausible deniability, they are going to continue to do this, so it's all out in the open now.
[37:45.000 --> 37:52.000]  And I ask those of you that are still on the fence, or those of you that work for the system, and even know this is true,
[37:52.000 --> 38:00.000]  but think that you're going to be on the winning team by going along with it.
[38:00.000 --> 38:08.000]  You are beyond the fool, because you know what you're doing is wrong, but you're still doing it like you're a Soviet agent,
[38:08.000 --> 38:14.000]  or a Nazi agent, or a fascist or communist agent. It's just next level.
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.000]  FDA vaccine advisor says healthy young people should not get another COVID booster.
[38:19.000 --> 38:26.000]  Oh, but look, Albert Morilla, the head of Pfizer, is normalizing this.
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.000]  He says, I've tested positive for COVID. I'm feeling well and symptom-free.
[38:31.000 --> 38:38.000]  I've not had the new, bivalent booster yet, and I was following CDC guidelines to wait three months.
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  This is my previous COVID case, which was back in mid-August.
[38:41.000 --> 38:48.000]  I've done it three times. Total, but two times in six weeks.
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.000]  While we've made great progress, the virus is still with us.
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.000]  So he's training the sheep that, oh, you get it, you take the shot, you get sick again.
[38:57.000 --> 39:04.000]  But all the studies show you're up to four times more than likely to get sick, hospitalized, or die.
[39:04.000 --> 39:15.000]  Israeli study, 93 times, excuse me, 93% of people dying have had the shot.
[39:15.000 --> 39:23.000]  And now Israeli investigators find COVID-19 vaccines cause side effects in leaked government documents and video.
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.000]  And the good news is people are waking up.
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  I was saying I was some New York Police Department guys on Thursday, a day before this broke,
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.000]  they said, don't break it yet, but the mayor is ending the mandate.
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  They're going to rehire the cops. They fired if they'll come back.
[39:38.000 --> 39:44.000]  And Mayor Adams will announce tomorrow that they're ending this.
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.000]  Well, the media didn't want to admit that show they spun it as Politico did.
[39:48.000 --> 39:56.000]  The New York Mayor Adams to sunset private sector vaccine mandates and end it for government.
[39:56.000 --> 40:02.000]  Supreme Court of the U.S. to consider case against COVID vaccine mandate for New York City employees.
[40:02.000 --> 40:11.000]  And the Army, the Marines, the Navy, the Air Force are all ending forced injection of the troops with the experimental shots.
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.000]  That's why we're here to fight back.
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  Even if we lose, it's the right thing to do.
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.000]  But most of the time, and this is the key to everything we do.
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  Listen to me, please. Let's say this very, very slowly.
[40:24.000 --> 40:36.000]  Most of the time, when we have right on our side and we fight back and we don't submit and we speak out and we support each other, we win.
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  So it's not valiant to expose corruption.
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  It's not valiant to stand up for what's right.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  It's not special.
[40:44.000 --> 40:47.000]  Though people celebrate it.
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.000]  That's when callers call in and they go, thank you so much for what you're doing.
[40:50.000 --> 40:51.000]  You're such a hero.
[40:51.000 --> 40:57.000]  I'm a hero to oppose injecting kids with deadly poison that raises their immune system and gives them heart attacks.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  I'm a hero to be against drag queen pedophile time.
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  I'm a hero to want to control the border.
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  I'm a hero to not want to ship fentanyl in.
[41:04.000 --> 41:09.000]  I'm a hero to want to help our military and give them pay raises and psychological hopes that don't commit suicide.
[41:09.000 --> 41:12.000]  I'm a hero because I don't want to devalue the currency.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  I'm a hero because I don't want war with Russia.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  I'm a hero.
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  I'm not a damn hero.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  I'm a normal person.
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  This is a normal response to all of this out of control evil.
[41:24.000 --> 41:30.000]  The Congress, not just Democrats, but Republicans as well, but it's merely Democrats,
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  say they're allowed to insider trade.
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.000]  They passed a special law under Obama 12 years ago to do it.
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  And they insider trade all day long.
[41:39.000 --> 41:44.000]  And if you or I do it, we go to prison.
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  It's not heroic to oppose that.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  It's called self preservation.
[41:49.000 --> 41:56.000]  So please, folks, stop thinking fighting these people is like who it's special and it's courage and it's amazing.
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  It's survival.
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  It's a life force.
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  It's a instinct to survive.
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.000]  It is a survival mechanism.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  It's the instinct to thrive.
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  It is not something special.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  It's not something to aspire to.
[42:17.000 --> 42:22.000]  You will do it or you will be destroyed and stop thinking of it as some hard thing to do.
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  You're designed to fight back.
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  You're designed to overcome.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  You're designed to not submit.
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.000]  You're designed to resist and overcome and win.
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.000]  Dammit, I believe in you and I bet on you.
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  And we are winning right now, but barely.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  It's so easy to turn the tide.
[42:39.000 --> 42:42.000]  It's so easy to take the governments over.
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.000]  And it's so easy to have Nuremberg to worldwide
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.000]  and convict these people and then hang their asses because they need to die
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  for what they've done killing our children and doing this to us.
[42:53.000 --> 43:22.000]  They will be tried first before we break their necks.
[43:25.000 --> 43:31.000]  As well as XRP, Monero, Litecoin, USDcoin, Dogecoin and Stellar.
[43:31.000 --> 43:32.000]  This is it.

[43:59.000 --> 44:02.000]  The rage for more than a decade
[44:02.000 --> 44:07.000]  have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.000]  and so many other ingredients that are known to make us healthy,
[44:10.000 --> 44:15.000]  to make us vibrant and to defend our immune systems.
[44:15.000 --> 44:19.000]  Now over a year and a half ago, we came out with a product that was top sourced,
[44:19.000 --> 44:22.000]  top of the line as good as it's going to get,
[44:22.000 --> 44:25.000]  but then the supply chain broke down and it was sold out for more than a year.
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.000]  Finally, green fiber capsules, this big old bottle,
[44:29.000 --> 44:35.000]  jam-packed, is back in stock for a limited time at InfowarsStore.com 30% off.
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.000]  And this limited time left time to go into all the great things it does
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  or what it has inside.
[44:40.000 --> 44:44.000]  But go to InfowarsStore.com and look up green fiber capsules for yourself
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  and see how amazing it is.
[44:46.000 --> 44:49.000]  It funds the Infowar and keeps us on air.
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  We're all under globalist attack.
[44:51.000 --> 44:54.000]  They don't want you to have these essential nutrients that are in this product.
[44:54.000 --> 44:59.000]  Get yours today at 25% off at InfowarsStore.com now back in stock.
[44:59.000 --> 45:03.000]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things
[45:03.000 --> 45:08.000]  for your cardiovascular system, for your brain, for every part of your body.
[45:08.000 --> 45:15.000]  But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects.
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  It certainly does for me.
[45:17.000 --> 45:20.000]  When I take a couple of these capsules from an hour before bed,
[45:20.000 --> 45:23.000]  my sleep, my dreams are amazing.
[45:23.000 --> 45:29.000]  Now there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain.
[45:29.000 --> 45:32.000]  But I want you to experience it yourself.
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  We know it's good for your heart.
[45:34.000 --> 45:35.000]  We know it's good for your brain.
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.000]  We know it's good for your arteries and veins and your lungs
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  and every other function in your body.
[45:39.000 --> 45:44.000]  But I want you to experience this high-grade fish oil, this ultimate fish oil,
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  at InfowarsStore.com and see what it does if you take it before bedtime.
[45:48.000 --> 45:54.000]  Ultimate fish oil, 50% off, now exclusively available at InfowarsStore.com.
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[45:56.000 --> 46:25.000]  You're really going to miss out if you don't get it.
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter,
[46:29.000 --> 46:32.000]  my four-national daughter, and my wife makes dinner a lot of times.
[46:32.000 --> 46:33.000]  But I like to make it as well.
[46:33.000 --> 46:34.000]  I love to make breakfast.
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.000]  And literally, it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family
[46:38.000 --> 46:43.000]  and be nutritive and then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.000]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding,
[46:47.000 --> 46:50.000]  is our normal biological actions and coming together.
[46:50.000 --> 46:55.000]  They really are a sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that will domesticate us
[46:55.000 --> 46:57.000]  and turn us into lab rats.
[46:57.000 --> 47:26.000]  We cannot let this continue.
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.000]  You want to talk about a hero, somebody that was persecuted by Fauci
[47:39.000 --> 47:44.000]  and was a trailblazer decades ago, exposing the biomedical tyranny.
[47:44.000 --> 47:49.000]  A true maverick, Dr. Judy Mikovits, will be in studio next hour.
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.000]  All right, so I'm just going to say this again.
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  We are turning the tide.
[47:55.000 --> 47:56.000]  We are winning.
[47:56.000 --> 47:57.000]  I know that you can see it.
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  The enemy is scared.
[47:59.000 --> 48:02.000]  But they're going to throw everything they've got at us.
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  So we've got to fight now with our word of mouth and our prayer and our action
[48:06.000 --> 48:12.000]  and our support to whoever's fighting like our lives depend on it because it does.
[48:12.000 --> 48:20.000]  I told you close to 30 years ago, coming up in a month, it's 29 years on air.
[48:20.000 --> 48:26.000]  I told you that they were going to cut off the resources,
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  that they were going to bring in total tyranny,
[48:28.000 --> 48:31.000]  that they were going to come after your children with armies of pedophiles.
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  In fact, I want the archive is to find that.
[48:33.000 --> 48:36.000]  It's like 15 years ago, 14 years ago, 13 years ago.
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.000]  I would talk about armies of potbellied pedophiles 15 years ago to about 10 years ago,
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.000]  and I stopped saying it for some reason, but I remember saying it.
[48:44.000 --> 48:49.000]  I remember the clips and I said armies of potbellied pedophiles are coming for your children.
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  There's a whole stack of news on that I'm about to hit.
[48:53.000 --> 48:57.000]  You're like, why would they have men with giant fake breasts in class with kids?
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  Why would they have men spread their legs for children?
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.000]  Why would they have children sitting on men's laps while they have erections?
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  There's footage we shot five years ago in Austin,
[49:05.000 --> 49:08.000]  and we got new footage today that's just as bad,
[49:08.000 --> 49:13.000]  of completely naked men with only glitter on their genitals
[49:13.000 --> 49:17.000]  with little boys and girls sitting on erect penises.
[49:17.000 --> 49:22.000]  You can't show it on air.
[49:22.000 --> 49:29.000]  In fact, it's child porn.
[49:29.000 --> 49:33.000]  But because it's liberal, it's allowed.
[49:33.000 --> 49:39.000]  We have footage from this group of drag queen events I'm about to cover.
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  They call it drag queens, not drag queens.
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.000]  It's not Bob hoped us like a woman, you know, funny joke.
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  That's okay.
[49:46.000 --> 49:55.000]  It's stuff we can't even show you here.
[49:55.000 --> 50:00.000]  So that's what we're talking about.
[50:00.000 --> 50:05.000]  And why is major companies like Disney with all its pedophilia funding this?
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  Because if you'll put up with men dressed up like clowns,
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  with hard-ons, with little kids sitting on their laps,
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  you'll put up with anything.
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  If you'll put up with three-year-olds putting $10 bills
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  and $20 bills in G-strings of fat, disgusting men
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  who spread their legs in front of the kids,
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  I'm not going to put a lot of this on TV.
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.000]  The article on infowars.com has it all about Jeremy White.
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.000]  You want to actually go see it for yourself.
[50:34.000 --> 50:40.000]  But some of this stuff's so bad, I will not even show it on air.
[50:40.000 --> 50:45.000]  Adults should not be looking at this.
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  And anybody doing this, in my view, should be in prison.
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  But guess what?
[50:50.000 --> 50:55.000]  There are armed men with assault rifles at these events all over the country.
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  In some cases, pointing them at people,
[50:58.000 --> 51:03.000]  when folks come to protest, there's armed men to protect,
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  not from violence, but from exposure,
[51:06.000 --> 51:09.000]  what's happening inside these libraries, inside these public schools,
[51:09.000 --> 51:12.000]  inside these topless bars.
[51:12.000 --> 51:16.000]  You know, I've been to plenty of topless bars before I got married.
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  And you're there and it's kind of creepy,
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  but you do it with your buddies and whatever.
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  And you know you're being taken advantage of
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  and it's kind of sick, you feel dirty when you leave.
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  But you're an adult, you went to a topless bar.
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  Not judging anybody.
[51:31.000 --> 51:34.000]  I mean, my day, I picked up plenty of women from a topless bar.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  Had a lot of fun.
[51:36.000 --> 51:41.000]  But the point is, it was still evil and I repent of it.
[51:41.000 --> 51:45.000]  But can you imagine if you were at a regular heterosexual topless bar,
[51:45.000 --> 51:53.000]  off a highway, and you're sitting there watching some woman spin on the pole,
[51:53.000 --> 51:57.000]  feeling a little guilty that you're exploiting her, she's exploiting you,
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.000]  you're drinking a crown and coke.
[52:00.000 --> 52:05.000]  But you're all adults, you can kind of just say, well, it's okay.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  I've been there, not a hypocrite, folks.
[52:09.000 --> 52:13.000]  Imagine if they trotted a four-year-old up there to dance around naked,
[52:13.000 --> 52:17.000]  or half naked, you would start beating people's asses.
[52:17.000 --> 52:20.000]  You'd call a police.
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  Well, they do this all over the world now, sponsored by BlackRock.
[52:24.000 --> 52:25.000]  Look it up.
[52:25.000 --> 52:28.000]  Sponsored by Disney, sponsored by the corporate system
[52:28.000 --> 52:32.000]  to literally capture our children
[52:32.000 --> 52:39.000]  and dangle them in front of us and show what they've done.
[52:39.000 --> 52:45.000]  Shock video, children paraded around with half naked men,
[52:45.000 --> 52:50.000]  strokes drag queens growing during provocative dance performance.
[52:50.000 --> 52:53.000]  And then the drag queens get down on their legs
[52:53.000 --> 53:01.000]  and spread their legs and show their genitals to children.
[53:01.000 --> 53:08.000]  Little girls go up and grab men's crotches
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.000]  because they're imprinted genetically once they become a woman to have a husband,
[53:12.000 --> 53:17.000]  and when someone's being sexual, we have the instinct to have sex.
[53:17.000 --> 53:20.000]  That's why you've got to be of age to do that.
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  You've got to be of age to make that decision.
[53:22.000 --> 53:23.000]  You want to do it.
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  This is the same left in Gillette Brazer ads that says,
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  if a man asks a woman out on a date, it's rape.
[53:30.000 --> 53:35.000]  But if a big fat man in a clown outfit spreads their legs
[53:35.000 --> 53:41.000]  and has your child sit in their lap and has your child grab their testicles,
[53:41.000 --> 53:44.000]  it's liberal and loving.
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  We used to be concerned about these type of guys.
[53:46.000 --> 53:51.000]  They used to have to drive around in white vans and creep around in playgrounds.
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  But now they don't need to because their mothers,
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  as part of a Stockholm syndrome,
[53:55.000 --> 54:02.000]  satanic human sacrifice of their innocence, bring them to them to do this.
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  So let's play clip 17.
[54:06.000 --> 54:10.000]  Child strokes drag queens groin during provocative dance performance.
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  Then it shows the legs spreading and the rest of it.
[54:12.000 --> 54:16.000]  And I'm not going to show the other stuff because we're on a lot of TV stations
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  and not just children should not see this.
[54:19.000 --> 54:23.000]  Adults should not see this because this is to train our psyche to accept the civil.
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  Here it is.
[54:36.000 --> 54:44.000]  They're playing a little mermaid song while a four-year-old girl grabs the guy's testicles.
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.000]  They're radio listeners. They're reading this.
[54:47.000 --> 54:54.000]  Now, fat dude in a wig spreads his legs and children.
[54:54.000 --> 55:03.000]  I mean, imagine these poor children brought into this clown show in a bar.
[55:03.000 --> 55:07.000]  Because no adult would pay money to go see this,
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  but liberals, it's all these men and women with their kids and strollers,
[55:11.000 --> 55:17.000]  come to have men in clown suits and some satanic ceremony,
[55:17.000 --> 55:20.000]  talk to their kids and creep around.
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  That's enough. Just shut it down.
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  Women handing their kids to these monsters.
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.000]  Meanwhile, outside, let's play clip 16,
[55:36.000 --> 55:45.000]  Antifa Outside Supportive Drag Queen Pedophile Show event in Christian Church in Katie, Texas.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  Now, the churches are having these inside of them.
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.000]  Let's go ahead and play.
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.000]  And then later they pepper sprayed people while pointing guns at them.
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  Go ahead and play those clips.
[55:53.000 --> 56:06.000]  So armed men in black are there to intimidate and threaten people
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  so they can have their fun inside of the kids.
[56:17.000 --> 56:21.000]  I mean, this is the pedophile movement coming out of the closet.
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.000]  This is pedophile movement coming out of the closet.
[56:25.000 --> 56:29.000]  Let's go ahead and go to clip 18.
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.000]  Department of Education vows to punish teachers
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.000]  or they refuse to teach children about gender identity
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  and screw them up sexually.
[56:37.000 --> 56:38.000]  And here it is.
[56:38.000 --> 56:42.000]  The 2020 New Jersey Student Learning Standards
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  for Comprehensive Health and Physical Education
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.000]  has sections like this one on performance expectations
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.000]  that detail what should be taught concerning sexual activity,
[56:51.000 --> 56:55.000]  pregnancy, gender identification, and very specifically.
[56:55.000 --> 56:59.000]  What we did was reject those, that curriculum, those samples.
[56:59.000 --> 57:03.000]  Garwood School District is one of several that have opted out of those lessons.
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  We're going to teach about diversity.
[57:05.000 --> 57:08.000]  We're going to let everybody feel inclusive.
[57:08.000 --> 57:09.000]  This has nothing to do with that.
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.000]  This has to do with certain aspects about sexual education
[57:12.000 --> 57:17.000]  that I firmly believe we should not be teaching our kids.
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.000]  We can't say on air what they're teaching the children.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  Children can be shown it, but we can't show it on air
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  because it's pornographic.
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.000]  But if they can rape your children's minds, they can rape you.
[57:28.000 --> 57:31.000]  They can get you to accept this, you'll accept anything.
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  That's all this is.
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  Plain and simple is a pedophile army.
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.000]  Infowars.com. Tomorrow is Tuesday.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  Keep us on air. Support the broadcast.
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  Infowarsstore.com.
[57:43.000 --> 57:47.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[58:31.000 --> 58:34.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.000]  We had one.
[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  You wouldn't believe it.
[58:39.000 --> 58:43.000]  Anyway, so it's infowarsstore.com, and that's how we fund this operation.
[58:43.000 --> 58:46.000]  And if you don't fund us and don't want to see it, that's fine.
[58:50.000 --> 58:54.000]  Donald Trump and the Magna Republicans represented extremism
[58:54.000 --> 58:58.000]  that threatens the very foundations of our republic.
[58:58.000 --> 59:01.000]  I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have an operational name.
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  In fact, I bet it does.
[59:03.000 --> 59:06.000]  I bet it's called Operation Matador.
[59:06.000 --> 59:12.000]  They see us as the bull, and they are shaky, a red flag in our face.
[59:12.000 --> 59:17.000]  And the Matador is the deep state with a long, skinny, razor-sharp sword
[59:17.000 --> 59:21.000]  so that when the bull lunges forward, the Matador uses the force of its weight
[59:21.000 --> 59:25.000]  to drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  as the bull buries himself into the dust.
[59:28.000 --> 59:31.000]  They've got the ace of spades in their hand, which is false flags.
[59:31.000 --> 59:34.000]  Before you launch a war, you stage false flags.
[59:34.000 --> 59:38.000]  That's the first thing you do, because nobody wants to say they started a war.
[59:38.000 --> 59:42.000]  Bad guys start wars, so every time a war gets launched by bad guys,
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  they stage an event.
[59:44.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  Operation Matador.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  There's a through line of hate.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  That's the curse of indigenous people, to the original sin of slavery,
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  the terror of the Klan, to anti-immigration,
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  violence against the Irish, Italians, Chinese, Mexicans,
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  so many others laced through our history.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  There's a through line of violence against religious groups,
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic, anti-Mormon, anti-Muslim, anti-Hindu, anti-Seek.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  And that's through line of hate never fully goes away.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  But the root crosses are really the globalists like Klaus Schwab.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  They're grooming a younger generation of globalist talent.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  They're focused on cultivating this next generation,
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  and they've proven that they're quite good at this.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  This is a quote from Schwab in 2017.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  I have to say that when I mention now names like Miss Angela Merkel,
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  even Vladimir Putin and so on, they've all been young global leaders at the WEF.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  But what we're very proud of now is the young generation like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  We penetrate the cabinet.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  But we see he's complimenting himself for doing what?
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  Infiltrating the Canadian government,
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  grooming the Prime Minister, and then infiltrating his cabinet.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  So again, where does that leave the Daily Beast in their theory
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  that this is some sort of a conspiracy?
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  This is all a rebrand or a relaunch of the New World Order,
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  which was again called a conspiracy.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  And it was to create a totalitarian world government,
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  perhaps something akin to what we've seen from the UN, from the EU, or the WHO,
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  they've been in the news a little bit lately,
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  unelected, unaccountable to the people,
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  but they tell you what to do with your lives.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  What great reset architects believe is that modern democracy and a free market capitalism,
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  not kind of capitalism we have today, we'll talk about that a little bit,
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  but the free market capitalism has failed.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  And the only way to fix it is by marrying corporate interests
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  and the increasingly powerful state.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  This will create corporatist super-states, or maybe one day, a super-state,
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  that will see a new world government take shape.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  It's already happening, though it might not necessarily take the form of a government.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  It's a functional dictatorship via corporations.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  That's what they're doing, and it's already happening.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  And his corporate controllers, like Bill Gates...
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  This guy's unelected, and he's got way too much influence in global healthcare.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  He's a college dropout.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  He's not even a coder. Did you know that? He doesn't write code.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  He's just a monopolist.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  He's a criminal and a monopolist, and he went to Jeffrey Epstein's island,
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  which makes a lot of people say he's a child-raper.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  He told Trump, don't set up a commission on vaccines to study vaccines.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  That would be a dead end. That would be a bad thing.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  Why? What are they going to find out?
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  They're going to find out that vaccines are safe and effective, right? Wouldn't that be good?
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  And the king of England who is involved in all this eugenics and depopulation, King Charles III.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  At the moment, we've so degraded natural systems, ecosystems, biodiversity,
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  that it's becoming increasingly impossible for nature to sustain us.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  At the moment, it's all take-take.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  Now we've reached a situation where we really need four planets like Earth to survive
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  or to provide enough for everybody.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  But really, at the end of the day, it's the devil.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  Is it the root?
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  The root cause, ladies and gentlemen, is not King Charles, not Bill Gates,
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  not Klaus Schwab, not the donkey, but it's evil.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  Call it what you want. You can say what it is.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  You can play games all day, but this is a fight between good versus evil.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  And everything the New World Order does is destructive to their own interest.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  They go out of their way to kill, steal, and destroy because they like it.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  Because they hate God's creation. They hate human destiny.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  They are fundamentally, spiritually jealous of the Tree of Life,
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  and they want the Tree of Death.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  Dr. Judy Mykovitz is with us in studio, and when I think about Maverick,
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  I don't think about Tom Cruise in a fictitious movie.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  I think about Dr. Mykovitz.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  She has been through the fire. She exposed this decades ago.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  She has been the tip of the spear exposing what these poison shots would do,
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  and she has been vindicated in spades.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  So, Doctor, I want to thank you so much for joining us tonight.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  I'm not going to go over your whole background and your doctorates in chemistry
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  and all the rest of them in microbiology.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  But, I mean, the FDA fourth panel they have, saying don't give it to kids.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  It doesn't work. The numbers from insurance companies, the mass deaths,
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  the cancer, the CDC document in October 2000 predicting all this would happen.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  The rats leaving the sinking ship.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  I want to try to shut up the shower because you're an amazing lady,
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  and just let you roll. Thank you so much for coming to Austin.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  It was amazing to meet you in person.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  Thank you, Alex. It's a pleasure to be here in Austin and to meet you in person as well.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  Well, it's your show. There's camera four right there. Take over.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  Wow.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  Well, honestly, you know, this never had anything to do with a vaccine.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  This never had anything to do with science.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  This isn't, you know, nothing about this is science.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  This is about literally control and the weaponization of...
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  I don't even know how to say it other than that.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  You know, everything we've been fighting for for the last four decades,
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  literally since the day I walked into the National Cancer Institute, June 10th, 1980,
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  natural products. My job was to use plants and God's nature as medicine.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  And that's what we did through the pandemics.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  I'll continue to call them as we saw the weaponization of our food,
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  genetically modified food, genetically modified organisms,
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  genetically modified viruses manufactured in laboratories.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  This was my job, was to understand the innate immune system,
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  the immune system given by God.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  My PhD thesis in 1992 basically, not basically, totally said HIV did not cause AIDS
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  but you kept your God given innate front line immune system healthy.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  And yet, Tony Fauci directed programs towards away from healing natural products,
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  away from things like peptide tea, the subject of the Dallas Buyers Club,
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  away from, you know, literally any natural product therapies,
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  all of which we could have used then and now.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  And this has been the topics of our books.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  This is what, you know, I say in the movie, Pandemic,
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  which Mickey Willis sat down with me in 2019,
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  literally 10 years after I was jailed for telling the truth,
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  after I, when I was let out of jail.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  For those who don't know, tell us who you are, what happened to you for exposing Fauci.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  Well, thank you for asking.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  So, you know, I was a young technician, 25 years old, in 1984,
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  when I was called on the phone when the boss was out of town
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  and asked by Fauci and Bob Gallo and others
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  to give them the natural isolate of HIV.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  It wasn't HIV at the time.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  It was called lymph adenopathy virus, and it had been isolated by Luc Montignier.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  Dr. Luc Montignier, now Nobel laureate, he got the Nobel Prize
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  for isolating the virus from people with the disease called gay-related immune deficiency.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  So, my job as a chemist was to produce, manufacture large amounts of the virus,
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  which I did, and replicate his work.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  But Tony Fauci didn't wanted that isolate and Bob Gallo at the time, Robert Gallo,
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  in order to do gain of function studies.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  And I did not appreciate until Mickey Willis sat down with me in 2019
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  and just said, my brother died of AZT,
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  and you could have knocked me over with a feather while I said, don't you mean AIDS?
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  And he said, no, he was antibody positive.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  He was immune.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  That's the definition of immunity according to every vaccine.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  And so the new AZT is rendezvous.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  Correct.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  Luc Montignier.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  So, the new AZT, so millions of innocent people worldwide were killed with AZT.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  And it was called AIDS.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  And we simply wrapped a narrative around killing, as Tony Fauci said at the time,
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  gays, IV drug users, and prostitutes were absolutely the only ones who could get AIDS,
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  or HIV, in fact.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  Well, it's incredible as they claim they love gay people and black people,
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  but they're just targeting constantly.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  Correct.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  So this has been a narrative over that time.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  My PhD thesis was actually done at George Washington University.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  And at the time, and this is more of the narrative,
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  that at the time, one in 10,000 T cells, the cells that HIV theoretically was killing,
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  one in 10,000 T cells were infected.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  And yet they called it, and yet all the T cells were dying.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  And they called it bystander effects.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  Now they're calling it long haul COVID while we kill the women and children who were infected
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  with other families of retroviruses.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  Talk to me like I'm five years old.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  Give us a summation.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  What are they really doing, doctor?
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  What they're really doing is driving a narrative and premeditated murder of everyone who was
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  vaccine injured over the last 40 years, regardless of the vaccine.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  I was going to say, currently, what are they injecting us with?
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  Currently, God only knows, but they're injecting us with a synthetic, I call it XMRV, Xenotropic,
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  Xeno means foreign, mouse monkey or manufactured virus coming from laboratories as they've
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  come from laboratories in every single polio shot.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  You've got dozens, if not hundreds of viruses.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  They're injecting, they injected SARS-CoV-2 was manmade.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  It was published in 2004.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  A solution was hydroxychloroquine.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  That was published in 2005.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  We know from the published literature that this never had anything to do with SARS-CoV-2,
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  that thousands were dying in January of 2020 from influenza.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  So you're saying it's a giant experiment.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  Correct.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  But it's been a giant experiment for 40 years and the experiment they conducted, they knew
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  how to kill the susceptible, you know, the people they intended to kill, the blacks,
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  you know, women, this children.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  They knew their immune systems.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  A virus doesn't know your politics, Democrat or Republican.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  A virus knows your immune system.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  You're saying it's race specific.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  It's race and gender and even to culture.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  We know of things like BRCA1, breast cancer one is more in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  So we see from the constructed things that people talk about.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  It doesn't matter if you're in cleavage site, but the synthesis of that RNA, that synthetic
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  RNA was weaponized to kill the people who had been injured with these shots.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  Wow.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  Incredible.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  We're going to go to break.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  How do people find the films you've made, the books you've written, the work they're
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  trying to suppress?
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  Well, I haven't made any films, but Mickey will.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  We've been in films.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  Yeah.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  So, then PlagnemicSeries.com our books are at plaguethebook.com or therealdoctorjudy.com.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  We've written four books now on plague ending, plague, and plague of corruption.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  And plague of corruption was the book upon which the original Plagnemic which aired
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  first May 4th, 2020 was about this plague of corruption that is and always was COVID-19.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.920]  Let's be a trillion percent clear.
[1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:46.920]  You've been vindicated.
[1:15:46.920 --> 1:15:47.920]  It's all coming out.
[1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:50.880]  We'll talk about what it means to you when we come back.
[1:15:50.880 --> 1:16:20.840]  Let's stay with us.
[1:16:20.840 --> 1:16:25.720]  We went and looked at the top 10, and they all had the same ingredients in common that
[1:16:25.720 --> 1:16:26.720]  is in this product.
[1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:34.240]  But with our new product from X7, Diet Force, we got the very best concentrates of these
[1:16:34.240 --> 1:16:39.160]  known natural essences that's two amazing things for your body.
[1:16:39.160 --> 1:16:43.360]  And so I've lost almost 40 pounds, I'm so a little bit overweight, in the last three
[1:16:43.360 --> 1:16:47.320]  months, and I've been doing it using Diet Force and also exercise.
[1:16:47.320 --> 1:16:54.160]  Well, now Diet Force is exclusively available right now at InfowarsStore.com, 40% off.
[1:16:54.160 --> 1:16:57.800]  InfowarsStore.com, Diet Force, you need to take this product.
[1:16:57.800 --> 1:16:58.800]  It really works.
[1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:03.120]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a
[1:17:03.120 --> 1:17:07.920]  rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these
[1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:08.920]  profiles.
[1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:09.920]  You see it every year.
[1:17:09.920 --> 1:17:14.840]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers,
[1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:20.640]  and almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:24.000]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  this and knowing this.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:30.640]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:35.920]  to be able to do things tax-wise that's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of
[1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:36.920]  your money.
[1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:41.640]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[1:17:41.640 --> 1:17:46.880]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com.
[1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:59.560]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-904-285, 833-904-285.
[1:17:59.560 --> 1:18:04.280]  The best-selling book in America last week was The Great Reset and the War for the Worlds
[1:18:04.280 --> 1:18:06.800]  written by Alex Jones.
[1:18:06.800 --> 1:18:11.560]  Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week, but the New York Times lied
[1:18:11.560 --> 1:18:13.840]  about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that.
[1:18:13.840 --> 1:18:17.560]  The New York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New
[1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:18.560]  York Times.
[1:18:18.560 --> 1:18:22.680]  The paper that started the Iraq War by lying about weapons mass destruction and got a million
[1:18:22.680 --> 1:18:23.680]  people killed.
[1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:25.560]  So they lied about his book.
[1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:31.160]  The Great Reset and the War for the World, the historic book that lays out the plans of
[1:18:31.160 --> 1:18:39.320]  the Great Reset Death Star and exposes the New World Order's plans for global enslavement.
[1:18:39.320 --> 1:18:46.000]  Get your copy now at amazon.com to keep the book at number one and infowarstore.com to
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:48.960]  help keep Infowars on the air.
[1:18:48.960 --> 1:18:59.080]  The Great Reset and the War for the World by Alex Jones, now number one in the world.
[1:18:59.080 --> 1:19:03.560]  Infowars work has never been having a bigger effect than it's having right now.
[1:19:03.560 --> 1:19:06.240]  And today is do or die time.
[1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:10.440]  If Infowars gets the funding into the midterms in the next year, we're going to stay on air
[1:19:10.440 --> 1:19:11.760]  and be more effective than ever.
[1:19:11.760 --> 1:19:17.320]  But if we don't, I respect your decision and I'm ready to basically implode and shut down
[1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:18.760]  our main operations.
[1:19:18.760 --> 1:19:23.680]  I've done my work, I've put everything into it, I'm leaving it all in the field.
[1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:28.120]  But I believe at a gut level, you're going to come through plus you're going to get great
[1:19:28.120 --> 1:19:30.280]  products that your family already need.
[1:19:30.280 --> 1:19:34.280]  So don't procrastinate, show Infowars, you want us to stay on the air.
[1:19:34.280 --> 1:19:38.240]  Go to infowarstore.com where we've got three great products back in stock.
[1:19:38.240 --> 1:19:42.200]  Vitamin C and zinc, highest quality, super strong, back in stock.
[1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:46.200]  Vitamin D3 and calcium and of course DNA Force Plus.
[1:19:46.200 --> 1:19:51.800]  All these products are 50% off together in a combo pack or 40% off individually.
[1:19:51.800 --> 1:19:55.120]  So the great products you already need for your immune system and we need the money to
[1:19:55.120 --> 1:19:56.120]  stay on air.
[1:19:56.120 --> 1:19:57.120]  So please take action now.
[1:19:57.120 --> 1:19:58.120]  All right.
[1:19:58.120 --> 1:19:59.120]  Thank you.
[1:19:59.120 --> 1:20:00.120]  And thank you.
[1:20:00.120 --> 1:20:11.200]  Leading up front a little assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:11.200 --> 1:20:16.820]  Dr. Judy Megamist is our guest.
[1:20:16.820 --> 1:20:23.380]  He's here with us in the studio, the original whistleblower exposing this whole thing.
[1:20:23.380 --> 1:20:28.780]  So you covered some of the past history of this, but what do you make of even the FDA
[1:20:28.780 --> 1:20:34.580]  board saying don't give the shot to kids, it doesn't work, the CDC head saying it doesn't
[1:20:34.580 --> 1:20:39.380]  work, what are they doing?
[1:20:39.380 --> 1:20:44.820]  Well I think that the great news is so many people are waking up.
[1:20:44.820 --> 1:20:52.060]  And I mean doctors, nurses, healthcare professionals everywhere waking up and saying wait a minute
[1:20:52.060 --> 1:20:53.060]  there's a problem.
[1:20:53.060 --> 1:21:00.140]  It really doesn't matter what the, you know, what the research or science tell you it is.
[1:21:00.140 --> 1:21:05.900]  The fact of the matter is people are dying, kids are getting myocarditis, people are getting
[1:21:05.900 --> 1:21:10.300]  sick, whether or not we could predict that, really doesn't matter.
[1:21:10.300 --> 1:21:16.500]  The real good news is doctors everywhere are seeing that if they stand up and do the right
[1:21:16.500 --> 1:21:23.180]  things there are simple biblical solutions and healing solutions that have been available
[1:21:23.180 --> 1:21:25.940]  to us, you know, since HIV AIDS.
[1:21:25.940 --> 1:21:26.940]  We have the solution.
[1:21:26.940 --> 1:21:32.340]  And I want to talk about the natural therapeutic solutions, but just an example, people always
[1:21:32.340 --> 1:21:37.620]  say where are the heroes, if this is a big conspiracy we see good people speak out against
[1:21:37.620 --> 1:21:38.620]  it.
[1:21:38.620 --> 1:21:44.260]  You are that person on record at the heart of the HIV research project of Fauci and
[1:21:44.260 --> 1:21:48.860]  you're exposing him for decades and it's all been proven that you predicted what happened
[1:21:48.860 --> 1:21:50.980]  with COVID and what you said came true.
[1:21:50.980 --> 1:21:52.820]  So that gives you great credibility.
[1:21:52.820 --> 1:21:58.540]  So people say where are the heroes to say no, well here she is.
[1:21:58.540 --> 1:22:05.780]  Not me, really, you know, the, I mean, my pastor, Rob McCoy, the people who stood up,
[1:22:05.780 --> 1:22:13.100]  Rob McCoy told us, you know, to stand with God and Mickey Willis is a hero, Mickey Willis
[1:22:13.100 --> 1:22:16.380]  is a hero, you know, for making that film.
[1:22:16.380 --> 1:22:24.180]  It cost us all quite a bit to stand then, but as we stood then and we stand now we see
[1:22:24.180 --> 1:22:28.180]  dozens of doctors coming, standing with us.
[1:22:28.180 --> 1:22:35.340]  The heroes are the nurses, thousands, yeah, thousands, the nurses on the front line, the
[1:22:35.340 --> 1:22:41.140]  doctors, the pastors that are standing with us and standing strong and praying for us.
[1:22:41.140 --> 1:22:47.180]  So when I, when I, when I sign the book, Mickey Willis's book or my book, I use second
[1:22:47.180 --> 1:22:55.380]  Chronicles 714 and that says, if we humble ourselves, we're not heroes, we're God servants.
[1:22:55.380 --> 1:23:03.500]  If we humble ourselves, pray to the heavens, repent, turn from our wicked ways, just stop
[1:23:03.500 --> 1:23:04.500]  doing this.
[1:23:04.500 --> 1:23:06.380]  God will heal our land.
[1:23:06.380 --> 1:23:13.540]  God will heal our land, not our, not the individuals, our land and we the people, we're one nation
[1:23:13.540 --> 1:23:18.340]  under God and, and as this country goes, everything goes.
[1:23:18.340 --> 1:23:20.100]  And I know that's why you fight.
[1:23:20.100 --> 1:23:26.100]  I know that's why you do it because we're patriots, we're, we're nationals.
[1:23:26.100 --> 1:23:28.900]  Pleasure to hear you, daughter.
[1:23:28.900 --> 1:23:31.420]  Sorry, if you cry, I'll cry.
[1:23:31.420 --> 1:23:32.420]  Yeah.
[1:23:32.420 --> 1:23:38.740]  But, but you've lost so much more than I have, but me too, we've paid a lot for this,
[1:23:38.740 --> 1:23:41.380]  but it's a, it's a blessing to do it.
[1:23:41.380 --> 1:23:43.580]  And it's absolutely all gain.
[1:23:43.580 --> 1:23:49.740]  It's been more than a decade for me since I, since, you know, whoever the FBI surrounded
[1:23:49.740 --> 1:23:52.220]  my house and took everything.
[1:23:52.220 --> 1:23:57.700]  And what we were told is trust God and, and you didn't bow to that, you're stronger than
[1:23:57.700 --> 1:23:58.700]  ever.
[1:23:58.700 --> 1:23:59.700]  Yeah.
[1:23:59.700 --> 1:24:00.700]  Never bowed to it.
[1:24:00.700 --> 1:24:01.700]  And we got everything back.
[1:24:01.700 --> 1:24:04.020]  We, we got everything back.
[1:24:04.020 --> 1:24:10.980]  We, my husband, I live pure joy for that, for that entire decade.
[1:24:10.980 --> 1:24:11.980]  Yeah.
[1:24:11.980 --> 1:24:18.940]  We, we lost everything, but you know, um, money is never why we worked and that's not
[1:24:18.940 --> 1:24:20.780]  why you didn't kill children.
[1:24:20.780 --> 1:24:28.580]  Well, you know, I, I don't believe there was ever any doctor, any nurse, any scientist
[1:24:28.580 --> 1:24:33.580]  anywhere who would have ever intentionally killed.
[1:24:33.580 --> 1:24:39.940]  We worked 24 seven and, and I remember in my arrogance, the humblest, the importance
[1:24:39.940 --> 1:24:48.860]  when I was 24, um, I was working 24 seven and I remember the protests around our laboratories
[1:24:48.860 --> 1:24:54.220]  at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland and, and on international tours saying scientists
[1:24:54.220 --> 1:25:00.060]  are murderers and I remember thinking it was your bad behavior.
[1:25:00.060 --> 1:25:03.380]  And um, that's what we've been led to do to divide each other.
[1:25:03.380 --> 1:25:06.620]  A virus doesn't know your immune system.
[1:25:06.620 --> 1:25:15.260]  And that I learned that only talking to Mickey 30 years later, it wasn't their bad behavior.
[1:25:15.260 --> 1:25:17.140]  It, it, it was a lie.
[1:25:17.140 --> 1:25:22.500]  We were taught to be divided and, and hate each other that, that there's any, it's the
[1:25:22.500 --> 1:25:28.500]  gays fault, that's why, yeah, and, but we, the people let that happen.
[1:25:28.500 --> 1:25:34.460]  And when we let Tony Fauci get away with that, then, you know, these were crimes committed
[1:25:34.460 --> 1:25:37.100]  then and, and, and committed now.
[1:25:37.100 --> 1:25:43.420]  And until we hold these criminals accountable, we won't see the end of this.
[1:25:43.420 --> 1:25:46.940]  But now we, the people can stand up and heal our land.
[1:25:46.940 --> 1:25:53.180]  I agree to quantify it in like three minutes, what is the plan, who are these people?
[1:25:53.180 --> 1:26:03.020]  Well, the, the plan of COVID-19 and was to control the plan of the, these vaccines over
[1:26:03.020 --> 1:26:12.460]  the last, since November 14, 1986, when all liability was removed from the injured.
[1:26:12.460 --> 1:26:22.100]  The plan was to see if, you know, you know, I, I, Pastor Rob showed me Darwin's thesis,
[1:26:22.100 --> 1:26:26.860]  the preservation of favored species in the struggle for life.
[1:26:26.860 --> 1:26:29.300]  There are no favored species.
[1:26:29.300 --> 1:26:31.460]  God's given us all we need.
[1:26:31.460 --> 1:26:40.420]  The plan is what the globalist told us to control us, to, to put us in a place of subservience,
[1:26:40.420 --> 1:26:47.620]  to let us know that our God or to try to make us think our God is not all we need and our
[1:26:47.620 --> 1:26:51.620]  God and our food is all we need.
[1:26:51.620 --> 1:26:52.820]  That's it.
[1:26:52.820 --> 1:26:59.220]  Good food, not genetically modified food, not genetically modified viruses, not lab-created
[1:26:59.220 --> 1:27:00.460]  poisons.
[1:27:00.460 --> 1:27:02.580]  It never was about a poison.
[1:27:02.580 --> 1:27:06.260]  We've got all we need and it's food and healing and love.
[1:27:06.260 --> 1:27:12.420]  Our last book is going to be called God wins because God is love and love wins.
[1:27:12.420 --> 1:27:15.020]  And that's the message we're spreading.
[1:27:15.020 --> 1:27:16.940]  That's what pandemic was all about.
[1:27:16.940 --> 1:27:19.700]  That's what ending plague was all about.
[1:27:19.700 --> 1:27:21.400]  That's what our books get.
[1:27:21.400 --> 1:27:23.060]  It's not about me.
[1:27:23.060 --> 1:27:29.540]  If you love each other, we'll be singing and dancing in heaven as those who were murdered
[1:27:29.540 --> 1:27:32.060]  are today.
[1:27:32.060 --> 1:27:33.060]  It's true.
[1:27:33.060 --> 1:27:34.060]  They want to be God.
[1:27:34.060 --> 1:27:35.060]  They're not God.
[1:27:35.060 --> 1:27:36.060]  It's not God.
[1:27:36.060 --> 1:27:42.980]  He is a loser.
[1:27:42.980 --> 1:27:45.580]  And eternity is a long time.
[1:27:45.580 --> 1:27:48.700]  He will burn it all.
[1:27:48.700 --> 1:27:49.700]  Yeah.
[1:27:49.700 --> 1:27:50.700]  He will pay.
[1:27:50.700 --> 1:27:53.540]  Yeah, and we have confidence in that.
[1:27:53.540 --> 1:27:56.660]  We have confidence and I've seen it and I've lived it.
[1:27:56.660 --> 1:28:00.340]  I needed to humble myself.
[1:28:00.340 --> 1:28:06.120]  And when I got out of jail, I was told, if you tell the truth again, that was November
[1:28:06.120 --> 1:28:14.080]  22, 2011, if you do it again, we guarantee you next time we kill you or your husband.
[1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:21.120]  And my husband, you know, I said in the acknowledgement of the book, how many men would lose everything
[1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:25.200]  to keep their wife out of jail because he never stopped me.
[1:28:25.200 --> 1:28:33.620]  She said, honey, just speak the truth and love.
[1:28:33.620 --> 1:28:36.900]  It's a test of wills.
[1:28:36.900 --> 1:28:40.020]  And our will will break them.
[1:28:40.020 --> 1:28:41.020]  His will be done.
[1:28:41.020 --> 1:28:42.020]  On his will through us.
[1:28:42.020 --> 1:28:43.520]  On earth as it is in heaven.
[1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:44.520]  We're right back.
[1:28:44.520 --> 1:29:01.360]  Stay with us.
[1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:03.360]  Your voice counts.
[1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:08.360]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[1:29:08.360 --> 1:29:10.960]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:12.460]  They know you're angry.
[1:29:12.460 --> 1:29:16.760]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[1:29:16.760 --> 1:29:17.760]  we've got.

[1:29:58.900 --> 1:30:03.420]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher,
[1:30:03.420 --> 1:30:05.340]  a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire.
[1:30:05.340 --> 1:30:08.620]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[1:30:08.620 --> 1:30:09.620]  You see it every year.
[1:30:09.620 --> 1:30:14.820]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[1:30:14.820 --> 1:30:20.620]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[1:30:20.620 --> 1:30:24.020]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[1:30:24.020 --> 1:30:25.180]  this and knowing this show.
[1:30:25.180 --> 1:30:30.700]  It's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[1:30:30.700 --> 1:30:35.860]  To be able to do things tax-wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of
[1:30:35.860 --> 1:30:36.860]  your money.
[1:30:36.860 --> 1:30:41.620]  It's a great year if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[1:30:41.620 --> 1:30:48.780]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com
[1:30:48.780 --> 1:30:58.780]  or call 833-904-285, 833-904-285.
[1:30:58.780 --> 1:31:02.060]  People ask me all the time, what is your best new tropic?
[1:31:02.060 --> 1:31:07.700]  You've got TurboForce, you've got Brainforce Plus, and you've got Brainforce Ultra, which
[1:31:07.700 --> 1:31:09.300]  one is better?
[1:31:09.300 --> 1:31:18.180]  And that's like asking, what's better, a Ford F-150 or a Cadillac or a Ferrari?
[1:31:18.180 --> 1:31:20.180]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[1:31:20.180 --> 1:31:25.300]  It varies, all three are different formulas, all three do different things.
[1:31:25.300 --> 1:31:31.940]  TurboForce is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy, I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[1:31:31.940 --> 1:31:36.380]  Brainforce Plus is a long-term acting clean new tropic.
[1:31:36.380 --> 1:31:43.500]  This Brainforce Ultra is a super fast acting new tropic that creates incredible clarity,
[1:31:43.500 --> 1:31:45.020]  but doesn't last very long.
[1:31:45.020 --> 1:31:46.940]  They're all three different formulas.
[1:31:46.940 --> 1:31:54.180]  And finally, back in stock, massively discounted, Brainforce Ultra is available at infowarstore.com.

[1:32:09.300 --> 1:32:16.300]  What this concentrated and chovy oil, pure Arctic krill oil, and high quality wild caught

[1:32:59.340 --> 1:33:27.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:27.740 --> 1:33:33.580]  Dr. Judy Magovits, in studio with us right now, the original whistleblower against Fauci
[1:33:33.580 --> 1:33:40.780]  with AZT, AIDS, all of it, the cancer viruses, the vaccines, give us the technicals, because
[1:33:40.780 --> 1:33:45.500]  you were here, you were in a documentary that came out months before COVID, predicting all
[1:33:45.500 --> 1:33:50.420]  this, then after, they fear you so much, you're the original whistleblower, what is really
[1:33:50.420 --> 1:33:55.060]  going on, why do you think the rats are leaving the sinking ship, what happens next?
[1:33:55.060 --> 1:34:05.260]  Well, I think we really do know what's going on, it's very clear that what have been called
[1:34:05.260 --> 1:34:11.180]  vaccines since all liability was removed have been the injection of animal tissues, human
[1:34:11.180 --> 1:34:17.860]  aborted fetal tissues, cow blood, pig blood, you name it, the formaldehyde, glutamate.
[1:34:17.860 --> 1:34:22.580]  What's the end game, forcing a mutation in humans, transhumanism, why are they doing
[1:34:22.580 --> 1:34:23.580]  this?
[1:34:23.580 --> 1:34:31.580]  Yeah, the end game is control, the end game is, they've told you the end game was to control
[1:34:31.580 --> 1:34:38.860]  your brain, to control your movement, to create a better human 2.0, I believe is the scientific
[1:34:38.860 --> 1:34:47.420]  America human 2.0, the end game is to be God, and they absolutely can't do it, and I know
[1:34:47.420 --> 1:34:51.460]  that beyond a shadow of a doubt, because we're not our DNA, we're our chromosomes.
[1:34:51.460 --> 1:34:57.340]  Explain that, so they're just mad scientists, just madly like chimpanzees on the space shuttle
[1:34:57.340 --> 1:34:58.820]  punching buttons?
[1:34:58.820 --> 1:35:06.660]  No, they're doing it in a programmed way, but they've gotten some false assumptions
[1:35:06.660 --> 1:35:09.420]  that they can do.
[1:35:09.420 --> 1:35:11.940]  Explain that, so they're trying to play God, what's happening?
[1:35:11.940 --> 1:35:21.060]  Well, for instance, in vitro fertilization, you can fertilize an egg in vitro, but you
[1:35:21.060 --> 1:35:32.860]  need to implant the blastocyst, that's 64 cells, into a female uterus cell wall that is expressing
[1:35:32.860 --> 1:35:39.380]  a protein, a peptide called syncytine, that's the fusagenic peptide that holds the fertilized
[1:35:39.380 --> 1:35:46.140]  embryo into the uterine cell wall, well that's a key part of the vaccine, they use a synthetic
[1:35:46.140 --> 1:35:53.540]  or an animal syncytine in order to have you either sterilized or abort the fetus.
[1:35:53.540 --> 1:35:56.860]  So they're impregnating your body with a sterilization?
[1:35:56.860 --> 1:36:02.980]  They're trying to stop you from being impregnated, they're trying to stop humans.
[1:36:02.980 --> 1:36:05.820]  So this is a famous you and sterilization vaccine?
[1:36:05.820 --> 1:36:06.820]  Correct.
[1:36:06.820 --> 1:36:07.820]  And it's not.
[1:36:07.820 --> 1:36:08.820]  Elaborate on that, Dr.
[1:36:08.820 --> 1:36:15.260]  It's not the first, every polio vaccine has monkey kidney cell line in it, and we made
[1:36:15.260 --> 1:36:22.140]  the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the Vero monkey kidney cell line called E6, and we shipped it from
[1:36:22.140 --> 1:36:29.140]  Fort Detrick, I say we, Tony Fauci shipped it from Fort Detrick to China, to the Wuhan
[1:36:29.140 --> 1:36:30.140]  labs and...
[1:36:30.140 --> 1:36:33.660]  So they're out there saying take this shot, it's the best thing, it's the slide spread,
[1:36:33.660 --> 1:36:36.020]  on record they admit it's causing infertility?
[1:36:36.020 --> 1:36:42.140]  Correct, and they know it and they designed it that way, all the shots, every single shot
[1:36:42.140 --> 1:36:49.620]  can cause infertility, that has another animal or human syncytine, and Bayer Monsanto admitted
[1:36:49.620 --> 1:36:57.860]  that last October saying we use aborted fetal tissue cell lines in all of our products,
[1:36:57.860 --> 1:37:04.460]  in Tylenol, in preparation age, in a non-exhaustive list of everything you'll see in a pharmacy,
[1:37:04.460 --> 1:37:09.500]  and they said we understand you have a problem with the use of those in this vaccine, or
[1:37:09.500 --> 1:37:14.540]  with the purity of the human body, yeah we have a problem with the purity of the human
[1:37:14.540 --> 1:37:21.340]  body, and it's against our God to inject these and we won't do it, so it's again, they're
[1:37:21.340 --> 1:37:28.420]  trying to get you to buy their products and saying it's okay if we lace things with another
[1:37:28.420 --> 1:37:39.620]  human's RNA, DNA or protein, but 97% of our messenger RNA from our DNA to mRNA to protein,
[1:37:39.620 --> 1:37:48.420]  97% of our mRNA is never translated into protein, it's God given protection of the rest of our
[1:37:48.420 --> 1:37:57.060]  genome, God has given us, 97% of our mRNA is regulatory, protects us, so you can't inject
[1:37:57.060 --> 1:38:03.460]  synthetic RNA, you can't inject monkey RNA, you can't inject anything, without our immune
[1:38:03.460 --> 1:38:09.020]  saying uh-uh, that's not me, and my God's given us an immune system to fight it.
[1:38:09.020 --> 1:38:11.940]  So we were battle-hardened before this happened, we were ready.
[1:38:11.940 --> 1:38:13.260]  Yes, we were.
[1:38:13.260 --> 1:38:19.980]  Guys, I want to air this next segment, I'll send it to you, I know we haven't, but we
[1:38:19.980 --> 1:38:26.020]  have it right now, go ahead and roll the short clip of them offering people a lottery prize,
[1:38:26.020 --> 1:38:30.460]  this money, hamburgers, donuts, you name it, it'll just take this.
[1:38:30.460 --> 1:38:42.460]  How obvious is this, here it is.
[1:38:42.460 --> 1:38:46.740]  Now states and companies are going all out providing incentives to those who have not
[1:38:46.740 --> 1:38:47.980]  been vaccinated.
[1:38:47.980 --> 1:38:52.940]  States are ramping up those incentives, everything from cash prizes to college scholarships.
[1:38:52.940 --> 1:38:58.180]  New York state raffling off 50 scholarships to 12 to 17 year olds who get vaccinated.
[1:38:58.180 --> 1:39:05.180]  You worried about paying college tuition, tell your 12 to 17 year olds, get a shot, thousands
[1:39:05.180 --> 1:39:10.220]  of prizes available, including cruises and super bowl tickets, they're giving away 4
[1:39:10.220 --> 1:39:15.380]  to 150 trucks, they're giving away shotguns and hunting rifles as well, marijuana dispensaries
[1:39:15.380 --> 1:39:21.220]  are giving away joints for jabs, Krispy Kreme announcing this week a free donut, and yes,
[1:39:21.220 --> 1:39:22.220]  free beers.
[1:39:22.220 --> 1:39:24.260]  That's right, get a shot and have a beer.
[1:39:24.260 --> 1:39:29.220]  Today could be your lucky day if you've gotten at least one COVID vaccination shot.
[1:39:29.220 --> 1:39:34.060]  California's vaccine lottery, that's right, you could win one million dollars, a million
[1:39:34.060 --> 1:39:43.540]  dollars, one grand winner to take home, up to five million dollars if you get vaccinated
[1:39:43.540 --> 1:39:47.260]  next week, five million dollars, you guys weren't expecting that one, were you?
[1:39:47.260 --> 1:39:51.260]  They made it exciting, right, there's a reason people go to Vegas.
[1:39:51.260 --> 1:39:56.420]  It really could be somewhat lucrative for them to get vaccinated if they aren't already
[1:39:56.420 --> 1:39:57.420]  persuaded.
[1:39:57.420 --> 1:40:03.140]  Just think of this when you think of vaccination, vaccination.
[1:40:03.140 --> 1:40:07.260]  If you need luck with love, dating apps are offering incentives too.
[1:40:07.260 --> 1:40:13.340]  We have finally found the one thing that makes us all more attractive, a vaccination.
[1:40:13.340 --> 1:40:19.100]  So they need you, Dr. Megavits, to give up your free will and accept this, they're just
[1:40:19.100 --> 1:40:21.100]  out there in the open.
[1:40:21.100 --> 1:40:29.180]  Yeah, and I can't understand why anyone who took a shot after they saw any of that doesn't
[1:40:29.180 --> 1:40:35.740]  realize, you know, how many times will you escape, you know, that bullet, how many, you
[1:40:35.740 --> 1:40:42.860]  know, there are five bullets in that six gun and right now, and people have gotten shot
[1:40:42.860 --> 1:40:44.340]  after shot after shot.
[1:40:44.340 --> 1:40:47.940]  And the death toll is confirmed, we're not hiding it, massive.
[1:40:47.940 --> 1:40:53.020]  Is the death, the side effect, is the main cause, is the main mission sterilization or
[1:40:53.020 --> 1:40:54.020]  what do you think?
[1:40:54.020 --> 1:40:59.140]  No, the death is intended, you know, it's death of everything, it's death of life as
[1:40:59.140 --> 1:41:06.340]  we know it, it's, you know, and really it is, you know, death of a God fearing society.
[1:41:06.340 --> 1:41:11.060]  It's intended to murder God fearing people.
[1:41:11.060 --> 1:41:15.020]  So what about the paradox of how it's liberal is taking the shot?
[1:41:15.020 --> 1:41:23.340]  Well, I just don't think they're, you know, that, you know, liberals, conservatives, you
[1:41:23.340 --> 1:41:27.780]  know, everyone's taking the shots right now, everyone's being forced to take the shots
[1:41:27.780 --> 1:41:33.420]  right now, or maybe they're not, maybe, maybe most people aren't taking the shots and we're
[1:41:33.420 --> 1:41:38.980]  just leading you to believe that my world is we're healthy and we're showing them we're
[1:41:38.980 --> 1:41:39.980]  healthy.
[1:41:39.980 --> 1:41:45.620]  I agree with you, the actual, they admit now 99% are saying no, the graph went like this
[1:41:45.620 --> 1:41:48.420]  and straight down, people woke up the last six months.
[1:41:48.420 --> 1:41:53.540]  Right, and that's the victory, that's God's, that's God wins, and that's us just showing
[1:41:53.540 --> 1:41:57.140]  the truth in love and showing them how healthy we are.
[1:41:57.140 --> 1:42:02.900]  You know, I'm already by virtue of working with these viruses for 40 years, I'm already
[1:42:02.900 --> 1:42:03.900]  infected.
[1:42:03.900 --> 1:42:07.780]  Well, Doc, final segment straight ahead, we were so blessed to have you here, but the
[1:42:07.780 --> 1:42:14.420]  fact that they would make a run at us would like this, this is so airing, it's so crazy.
[1:42:14.420 --> 1:42:18.940]  That's why we need to humble ourselves and that's what we're seeing, and I'm just so
[1:42:18.940 --> 1:42:19.940]  delighted.
[1:42:19.940 --> 1:42:20.940]  No, I agree.
[1:42:20.940 --> 1:42:23.420]  Everything I've been through a minute, I've become incredibly humble.
[1:42:23.420 --> 1:42:24.420]  Yeah.
[1:42:24.420 --> 1:42:28.300]  I was humble before, but now I'm like completely like God, you're in command, oh my God, this
[1:42:28.300 --> 1:42:30.140]  threat is so big.
[1:42:30.140 --> 1:42:36.020]  Yeah, but we win, and we've won already.
[1:42:36.020 --> 1:42:39.020]  We've won already, nobody's taken that shot.
[1:42:39.020 --> 1:42:40.020]  Congratulations.
[1:42:40.020 --> 1:42:43.260]  Well, let's talk about humbling ourselves before God and where this goes.
[1:42:43.260 --> 1:42:47.820]  The final segment with Dr. Judy Mingovitz, and we'll give your website out as well and
[1:42:47.820 --> 1:42:58.980]  the film and the book, so much more to us.
[1:42:58.980 --> 1:43:02.940]  Why don't we talk about cryptocurrency?
[1:43:02.940 --> 1:43:09.940]  Because one of the ways that you encourage your audience to give you money is in cryptocurrency
[1:43:09.940 --> 1:43:10.940]  donations, right?
[1:43:10.940 --> 1:43:11.940]  Yes.
[1:43:11.940 --> 1:43:15.700]  And you have a page on your website that's just for crypto currency donations, right?
[1:43:15.700 --> 1:43:17.700]  InfoWars.com slash crypto.
[1:43:17.700 --> 1:43:20.300]  Is that a little advertisement just there?
[1:43:20.300 --> 1:43:21.460]  Well, we're fighting the deep state.
[1:43:21.460 --> 1:43:22.460]  We need money.
[1:43:22.460 --> 1:43:23.460]  All right.
[1:43:23.460 --> 1:43:24.460]  This is it.
[1:43:24.460 --> 1:43:30.460]  Give crypto fun info wars, sponsor us with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, right?
[1:43:30.460 --> 1:43:37.180]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight, your advertises for your crypto currency page.
[1:43:37.180 --> 1:43:41.700]  You know, I mean, I mean, people want to keep us in the fight.
[1:43:41.700 --> 1:43:44.780]  So I mean, I hope whoever the big whales are, they'll give us money before we keep doing
[1:43:44.780 --> 1:43:45.780]  it.
[1:43:45.780 --> 1:43:49.340]  We'll just keep, we'll just keep minting money as you're in the sport room.
[1:43:49.340 --> 1:43:50.340]  All right.
[1:43:50.340 --> 1:43:51.340]  Let's move on.
[1:43:51.340 --> 1:44:03.020]  And people care about the first amendment.
[1:44:03.020 --> 1:44:04.020]  Granny do right.
[1:44:04.020 --> 1:44:05.020]  Granny do right.
[1:44:05.020 --> 1:44:06.020]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:44:06.020 --> 1:44:07.020]  Go ahead.
[1:44:07.020 --> 1:44:08.020]  Challenge.
[1:44:08.020 --> 1:44:09.460]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:44:09.460 --> 1:44:15.020]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[1:44:15.020 --> 1:44:20.460]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[1:44:20.460 --> 1:44:26.460]  And since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[1:44:26.460 --> 1:44:29.780]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:44:29.780 --> 1:44:33.820]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[1:44:33.820 --> 1:44:37.420]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:44:37.420 --> 1:44:41.940]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period
[1:44:41.940 --> 1:44:47.020]  of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is the ticket, this is working, this
[1:44:47.020 --> 1:44:48.020]  is wonderful.
[1:44:48.020 --> 1:44:54.500]  And now I don't have to put it on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[1:44:54.500 --> 1:45:00.900]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:45:00.900 --> 1:45:05.060]  Sold out for more than a year and a half because of supply chain breakdowns.
[1:45:05.060 --> 1:45:09.460]  Our best selling product, Super Blue, is finally back in stock.

[1:45:59.700 --> 1:46:03.620]  Just look at these headlines from Reuters.
[1:46:03.620 --> 1:46:09.540]  World faces unprecedented global hunger crisis UN chief says going into 2023.
[1:46:09.540 --> 1:46:14.820]  This food program warns of global food catastrophe, looming global catastrophe.
[1:46:14.820 --> 1:46:17.140]  The world could run out of food by 2023.
[1:46:17.140 --> 1:46:20.540]  Major studies say and the reports go on and on.
[1:46:20.540 --> 1:46:24.060]  We told you this was a designed program by the globalist two and a half years ago.
[1:46:24.060 --> 1:46:28.060]  We told you energy and food prices would explode and now they're up more than 40% in the US
[1:46:28.060 --> 1:46:29.060]  alone.
[1:46:29.060 --> 1:46:31.020]  Some areas of the world are up over 100%.
[1:46:31.020 --> 1:46:34.380]  The only way you beat inflation and protect yourself and your family is with high quality

[1:46:59.740 --> 1:47:05.740]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:54.740 --> 1:47:55.740]  I'm Dr. Judy McAvoy.
[1:47:55.740 --> 1:47:56.740]  This is our guest.
[1:47:56.740 --> 1:48:00.260]  We're the best places to be able to find your book, the films you've been in, the great
[1:48:00.260 --> 1:48:03.420]  work you're doing.
[1:48:03.420 --> 1:48:08.420]  TheRealDrJudy.com, PlandemicSeries.com, and PlagueTheBook.com.
[1:48:08.420 --> 1:48:13.780]  All right, the symptoms we have left, you've got the floor, dumb it down because you're
[1:48:13.780 --> 1:48:14.780]  a smart doctor.
[1:48:14.780 --> 1:48:17.380]  I'm pretty smart but half of it I miss.
[1:48:17.380 --> 1:48:18.380]  What are we facing?
[1:48:18.380 --> 1:48:19.380]  What's going on?
[1:48:19.380 --> 1:48:20.820]  Their whole agenda is falling apart.
[1:48:20.820 --> 1:48:22.340]  That's a great positive thing.
[1:48:22.340 --> 1:48:23.340]  Did they plan that?
[1:48:23.340 --> 1:48:26.540]  What do you think is going to happen next?
[1:48:26.540 --> 1:48:33.580]  What I pray happens next is that we, the people, never let this happen again, that we forgive
[1:48:33.580 --> 1:48:43.300]  ourselves, forgive each other, and just simply turn back to biblical living, to healing,
[1:48:43.300 --> 1:48:44.300]  to love.
[1:48:44.300 --> 1:48:47.100]  You know, God is love and love wins.
[1:48:47.100 --> 1:48:50.220]  And that's, they can't do anything.
[1:48:50.220 --> 1:48:55.420]  They're over there hoping that we will just say, oh, it was just that.
[1:48:55.420 --> 1:48:57.660]  We give them our power.
[1:48:57.660 --> 1:49:00.180]  We have the power.
[1:49:00.180 --> 1:49:02.260]  That we never give it away again.
[1:49:02.260 --> 1:49:06.820]  That we, if we, we will lose if we think it was just that shot.
[1:49:06.820 --> 1:49:12.860]  That's why I mentioned the Bayer Monsanto religious exemption attestation.
[1:49:12.860 --> 1:49:18.180]  They told you the poison was in everything, in every product they make.
[1:49:18.180 --> 1:49:24.780]  So they think we'll just keep going to their drug stores and buying their poison.
[1:49:24.780 --> 1:49:29.380]  But we won't anymore because we know all we need, God's given us healing food, no more
[1:49:29.380 --> 1:49:34.220]  genetically modified food, no more genetically modified organism.
[1:49:34.220 --> 1:49:42.660]  We go back to living and living in a way that I haven't seen since June 10th, 1980, when
[1:49:42.660 --> 1:49:46.860]  I walked in there with the idea to make plants into medicine.
[1:49:46.860 --> 1:49:49.260]  We did that then and we can do it again.
[1:49:49.260 --> 1:49:55.220]  So they're trying to destabilize us to sell us products and control us.
[1:49:55.220 --> 1:49:56.220]  Yeah.
[1:49:56.220 --> 1:50:04.780]  To force them on us or to bribe us with beer and cannabis and whatever else they just said
[1:50:04.780 --> 1:50:06.660]  they're millions of dollars.
[1:50:06.660 --> 1:50:07.940]  We don't need money.
[1:50:07.940 --> 1:50:10.060]  We don't live for money.
[1:50:10.060 --> 1:50:11.060]  We live for.
[1:50:11.060 --> 1:50:12.060]  I want you to make that video.
[1:50:12.060 --> 1:50:13.060]  I'll give you a hamburger.
[1:50:13.060 --> 1:50:14.060]  Just take the shot.
[1:50:14.060 --> 1:50:15.060]  They admit it doesn't work.
[1:50:15.060 --> 1:50:16.620]  They admit it makes you sick.
[1:50:16.620 --> 1:50:19.140]  They hope we just forget what they just did for the last two years.
[1:50:19.140 --> 1:50:20.140]  You know what?
[1:50:20.140 --> 1:50:22.580]  I honestly thought, oh, the hamburger is GMO.
[1:50:22.580 --> 1:50:24.740]  So that's an adjuvant to the poison.
[1:50:24.740 --> 1:50:26.380]  So it'll kill you quicker.
[1:50:26.380 --> 1:50:28.540]  That's what I actually saw when I saw it.
[1:50:28.540 --> 1:50:29.540]  Yeah.
[1:50:29.540 --> 1:50:31.900]  It's an adjuvant in their shot to kill you quicker.
[1:50:31.900 --> 1:50:33.500]  You shouldn't be binary weapon.
[1:50:33.500 --> 1:50:35.940]  You shouldn't be in that hamburger in the first place.
[1:50:35.940 --> 1:50:37.140]  It's not good for you.
[1:50:37.140 --> 1:50:40.180]  So in closing, amazing being here, we got eight minutes left.
[1:50:40.180 --> 1:50:42.420]  What do you want to impart to the audience about what you've been through?
[1:50:42.420 --> 1:50:45.060]  What you've seen on the other side?
[1:50:45.060 --> 1:50:46.060]  Well, yeah.
[1:50:46.060 --> 1:50:48.300]  What I most like to impart.
[1:50:48.300 --> 1:50:55.420]  It's been more than a decade, and there were some really dark times.
[1:50:55.420 --> 1:51:03.540]  And all the way through it, I was encouraged by books, by friends, by pastors, staying
[1:51:03.540 --> 1:51:08.220]  in the world, that the book of Daniel, we're the best in the brightest.
[1:51:08.220 --> 1:51:11.820]  We won't ingest or inject your poison.
[1:51:11.820 --> 1:51:15.660]  And we are the best in the brightest, and that's biblical humility.
[1:51:15.660 --> 1:51:21.900]  So again, we've got to all forgive ourselves and repent.
[1:51:21.900 --> 1:51:27.660]  Repent means turn 180 degrees all the way around, not 360.
[1:51:27.660 --> 1:51:29.980]  Not looking for the next quick fix.
[1:51:29.980 --> 1:51:36.300]  There are no quick fixes, but when you live that way, you experience all the joy.
[1:51:36.300 --> 1:51:38.660]  So I'm just fine.
[1:51:38.660 --> 1:51:42.180]  We lost every penny we ever made, and we got it all back.
[1:51:42.180 --> 1:51:44.940]  We've got it all back in spades, in love.
[1:51:44.940 --> 1:51:47.380]  I don't even know.
[1:51:47.380 --> 1:51:51.140]  People just, you know, are just so kind and giving and to us.
[1:51:51.140 --> 1:51:52.940]  And that's the answer.
[1:51:52.940 --> 1:51:58.140]  That's those sweet nurses and doctors and teachers who stand for your children and take
[1:51:58.140 --> 1:52:04.460]  care of your children, who stand in the emergency rooms and sneak Ivermectin into the patients
[1:52:04.460 --> 1:52:06.020]  and get them home.
[1:52:06.020 --> 1:52:08.100]  There are a lot of angels out there.
[1:52:08.100 --> 1:52:12.780]  They're far more of us than there are of them, and we can win this thing.
[1:52:12.780 --> 1:52:16.700]  And by the way, I don't just say this, the enemy's scared right now.
[1:52:16.700 --> 1:52:18.500]  They're scared.
[1:52:18.500 --> 1:52:24.420]  They should be because we, we didn't give up you.
[1:52:24.420 --> 1:52:26.300]  You fought this longer than I have.
[1:52:26.300 --> 1:52:29.900]  For me, I only saw this in 2009.
[1:52:29.900 --> 1:52:30.900]  That's you.
[1:52:30.900 --> 1:52:32.980]  You fought it your entire life.
[1:52:32.980 --> 1:52:34.580]  I didn't see any of this.
[1:52:34.580 --> 1:52:40.700]  I was that stupid kid who thought somehow it was the bad behavior of a gay man or an
[1:52:40.700 --> 1:52:48.500]  IV drug user, so yeah, they should be afraid right now because everyone in this country
[1:52:48.500 --> 1:52:55.100]  is working, you know, of that gift we've been given of the United States of America.
[1:52:55.100 --> 1:53:00.060]  We're one nation under God, and we're not going to let them divide us.
[1:53:00.060 --> 1:53:03.020]  We're not going to let them steer us into hate.
[1:53:03.020 --> 1:53:06.860]  We're not going to, you know, take up our guns.
[1:53:06.860 --> 1:53:09.780]  Our weapon is the full armor of God.
[1:53:09.780 --> 1:53:12.660]  It always has been, and it always will be.
[1:53:12.660 --> 1:53:14.260]  And we are winning.
[1:53:14.260 --> 1:53:19.700]  What do you expect the dark side to do now, Dr. Mayovitz?
[1:53:19.700 --> 1:53:28.260]  I expect them to attempt to try to put us back in masks or whatever else, play the game
[1:53:28.260 --> 1:53:34.220]  of the next, the monkeypox, the cowpox, but it doesn't matter because what I know we will
[1:53:34.220 --> 1:53:36.700]  do is say not again.
[1:53:36.700 --> 1:53:37.700]  Not again.
[1:53:37.700 --> 1:53:39.860]  But they're trying right now to divide us.
[1:53:39.860 --> 1:53:44.020]  They're trying right now to get us to hate each other.
[1:53:44.020 --> 1:53:46.500]  We just will not go into hate.
[1:53:46.500 --> 1:53:48.700]  We're parting.
[1:53:48.700 --> 1:53:49.700]  That's the goal.
[1:53:49.700 --> 1:53:50.700]  We're showing you.
[1:53:50.700 --> 1:53:51.700]  Love wins.
[1:53:51.700 --> 1:53:52.700]  We're living.
[1:53:52.700 --> 1:53:54.260]  You're saying resistance is victory.
[1:53:54.260 --> 1:53:55.260]  Absolutely.
[1:53:55.260 --> 1:53:59.740]  Resistance to any kind of division or hate.
[1:53:59.740 --> 1:54:02.740]  Resistance not only to a shot, but to any shot.
[1:54:02.740 --> 1:54:04.180]  And they tell us we hate people.
[1:54:04.180 --> 1:54:06.380]  No, we love people.
[1:54:06.380 --> 1:54:07.380]  And it's happening.
[1:54:07.380 --> 1:54:08.380]  Yeah.
[1:54:08.380 --> 1:54:12.820]  It doesn't matter how they trick people do bad things or trick black people do bad things
[1:54:12.820 --> 1:54:13.820]  or white people.
[1:54:13.820 --> 1:54:15.180]  But we know that's all manipulation.
[1:54:15.180 --> 1:54:16.180]  We love each other.
[1:54:16.180 --> 1:54:17.180]  Absolutely.
[1:54:17.180 --> 1:54:18.180]  And that's what's powerful.
[1:54:18.180 --> 1:54:19.180]  Yeah.
[1:54:19.180 --> 1:54:21.740]  And we will not be tricked into, into hate.
[1:54:21.740 --> 1:54:24.580]  We won't be divided.
[1:54:24.580 --> 1:54:29.580]  So in the last four months we have left, what else do you want folks to know about what
[1:54:29.580 --> 1:54:32.860]  you've done and what you've stood up for?
[1:54:32.860 --> 1:54:38.980]  Well, you know, really, really that it's not about me that any single individual, I was
[1:54:38.980 --> 1:54:46.860]  a technician, you know, in 1984, 83 when all of this started.
[1:54:46.860 --> 1:54:50.460]  But I see whistleblowers like you as they're downfall.
[1:54:50.460 --> 1:54:52.380]  Yeah.
[1:54:52.380 --> 1:54:55.660]  But it's, it's that, it's that beautiful soul.
[1:54:55.660 --> 1:54:59.540]  That was the first book Kent Heck and Lively gave to me when I got out of jail.
[1:54:59.540 --> 1:55:04.580]  When I was told I could say nothing for five years to anybody who wasn't a lawyer or my
[1:55:04.580 --> 1:55:10.020]  immediate family, Kent called me up and said, I'm a lawyer and we wrote every word down.
[1:55:10.020 --> 1:55:11.220]  We've got everything.
[1:55:11.220 --> 1:55:16.900]  We've got God's proof in everything as a legal affidavit declaration.
[1:55:16.900 --> 1:55:21.700]  We've made it into four books and the last book will show you what we know these past
[1:55:21.700 --> 1:55:27.460]  two years that God wins no matter how many of them they murder, of us they murder.
[1:55:27.460 --> 1:55:29.340]  We won't let it steal our joy.
[1:55:29.340 --> 1:55:31.700]  We simply won't let it happen.
[1:55:31.700 --> 1:55:33.820]  And our souls were eternal.
[1:55:33.820 --> 1:55:34.820]  So exactly.
[1:55:34.820 --> 1:55:40.580]  It's like they persecuted you for exposing Valgy, but you have re-emerged, what, a thousand
[1:55:40.580 --> 1:55:41.740]  times stronger?
[1:55:41.740 --> 1:55:45.620]  Yeah, but probably a lot more than a thousand times stronger.
[1:55:45.620 --> 1:55:50.860]  But yeah, just, just gifted and, and, and just, just forgiven.
[1:55:50.860 --> 1:55:57.060]  I mean, I've been forgiven for a lot of my angry outbursts and I, I really do appreciate,
[1:55:57.060 --> 1:56:01.780]  you know, that my husband, my family, people, because I, I went through it in those days
[1:56:01.780 --> 1:56:07.300]  and, you know, I'm like taking it in my own hands and saying, no, I'll take care of this.
[1:56:07.300 --> 1:56:13.180]  And every single time a pastor or a loved one came up and said, Judy, chill, let's, let's,
[1:56:13.180 --> 1:56:14.620]  let's go have some fun.
[1:56:14.620 --> 1:56:15.620]  It's all good.
[1:56:15.620 --> 1:56:16.620]  You can't beat it yourself.
[1:56:16.620 --> 1:56:18.540]  You got to have God do it.
[1:56:18.540 --> 1:56:19.540]  Yeah.
[1:56:19.540 --> 1:56:20.540]  But you have to.
[1:56:20.540 --> 1:56:21.540]  That's what he's saying.
[1:56:21.540 --> 1:56:23.540]  You should know God is in command.
[1:56:23.540 --> 1:56:24.540]  God is in control.
[1:56:24.540 --> 1:56:27.980]  You're not control Fauci or Bill Gates or Klaus Schwab.
[1:56:27.980 --> 1:56:29.900]  You are not in control.
[1:56:29.900 --> 1:56:37.660]  No, and, and, and whoever is your God in this country, we are free and, and we are free
[1:56:37.660 --> 1:56:40.020]  to, to obey our God.
[1:56:40.020 --> 1:56:45.580]  Nobody can take away our food or our God, no matter how we believe or how we serve.
[1:56:45.580 --> 1:56:51.540]  We're here for a purpose and that's to love each other and serve each other.
[1:56:51.540 --> 1:56:52.540]  Thanks for being here.
[1:56:52.540 --> 1:56:53.540]  I feel your strength.
[1:56:53.540 --> 1:56:54.540]  Thank you.
[1:56:54.540 --> 1:56:55.540]  Love you.
[1:56:55.540 --> 1:56:56.540]  All right.
[1:56:56.540 --> 1:56:57.540]  All right.
[1:56:57.540 --> 1:56:58.540]  I want to take over.
[1:56:58.540 --> 1:56:59.540]  Got a bunch of big interviews coming up tonight.
[1:56:59.540 --> 1:57:00.540]  Dr. Judy.
[1:57:00.540 --> 1:57:01.540]  Thank you so much.
[1:57:01.540 --> 1:57:02.540]  How do folks find you?
[1:57:02.540 --> 1:57:03.540]  One more time.
[1:57:03.540 --> 1:57:04.540]  The real Dr. Judy.
[1:57:04.540 --> 1:57:05.540]  Dot com.
[1:57:05.540 --> 1:57:06.540]  Plague the book.

[1:57:07.540 --> 1:57:08.540]  Pandemic series.
[1:57:08.540 --> 1:57:09.540]  Dot com.
[1:57:09.540 --> 1:57:10.540]  All right.
[1:57:10.540 --> 1:57:11.540]  Beautiful.
[1:57:11.540 --> 1:57:12.540]  Great job, crew.
[1:57:12.540 --> 1:57:13.540]  Great job viewers and listeners.
[1:57:13.540 --> 1:57:14.540]  We'll archive this interview at band.video.
[1:57:14.540 --> 1:57:16.540]  Please share it and know it's a revolutionary act.
[1:57:16.540 --> 1:57:17.540]  Amazing job.
[1:57:17.540 --> 1:57:21.020]  Man, we're totally vindicated, which I don't want to be.
[1:57:21.020 --> 1:57:24.660]  They literally are killing us and admitting it's pure poison.
[1:57:24.660 --> 1:57:27.260]  What a group of monsters.
[1:57:27.260 --> 1:57:28.980]  What a group of scum.
[1:57:28.980 --> 1:57:34.020]  But we're scum if we don't oppose them, but we are.
[1:57:34.020 --> 1:57:37.500]  Sunday Night Live with Owen Shroyer coming up in Team Minus Two Minutes.
[1:57:37.500 --> 1:57:39.540]  Dr. Michalicz, thank you so much.
[1:57:39.540 --> 1:57:40.540]  Thank you.
[1:57:40.540 --> 1:57:50.540]  One of the ways that you're always on the line is that you're always on the line.
[1:57:50.540 --> 1:57:56.540]  That you encourage your audience to give you money using cryptocurrency donations, right?
[1:57:56.540 --> 1:57:57.540]  Yes.
[1:57:57.540 --> 1:57:58.540]  Infowars.com slash crypto.
[1:57:58.540 --> 1:58:01.540]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight.
[1:58:01.540 --> 1:58:02.540]  Jack.
[1:58:02.540 --> 1:58:04.540]  Your advertiser is trying to cryptocurrency page.
[1:58:04.540 --> 1:58:06.540]  People care about the First Amendment.
[1:58:06.540 --> 1:58:11.540]  And in the cryptocurrency page, people can give you Bitcoin.
[1:58:11.540 --> 1:58:12.540]  Yes.
[1:58:12.540 --> 1:58:13.540]  Yes.
[1:58:13.540 --> 1:58:14.540]  Ethereum.
[1:58:14.540 --> 1:58:15.540]  Right.
[1:58:15.540 --> 1:58:16.540]  Yes.
[1:58:16.540 --> 1:58:20.540]  Monero, Litecoin, USDcoin, Dogecoin, and Stellar.
[1:58:20.540 --> 1:58:21.540]  This is it.
[1:58:21.540 --> 1:58:24.540]  Give crypto, fund Infowars.

[1:58:48.540 --> 1:58:54.540]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[1:58:54.540 --> 1:58:56.540]  and chemicals added to the food.
[1:58:56.540 --> 1:58:57.540]  It's all come out.
[1:58:57.540 --> 1:59:01.540]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God,
[1:59:01.540 --> 1:59:04.540]  the creator, and we are powerful.
[1:59:04.540 --> 1:59:07.540]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[1:59:07.540 --> 1:59:11.540]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[1:59:11.540 --> 1:59:12.540]  with the boy.
[1:59:12.540 --> 1:59:15.540]  Is it true?
[1:59:15.540 --> 1:59:20.540]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[1:59:20.540 --> 1:59:25.540]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[1:59:25.540 --> 1:59:29.540]  death because they know we are strong.
[1:59:29.540 --> 1:59:33.540]  And they know in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser.
[1:59:33.540 --> 1:59:37.540]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep Infowars on the air now more than ever.
