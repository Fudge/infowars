[00:00.000 --> 00:14.280]  According to Pfizer's very limited human trials, 87% of pregnant mothers lost their babies
[00:14.280 --> 00:16.280]  after receiving the shot.
[00:16.280 --> 00:21.480]  And for those who survived the deadly shot and are able to reproduce, their offspring's
[00:21.480 --> 00:24.880]  DNA is now forever mutated.
[00:24.880 --> 00:31.320]  There is now irrefutable proof that the mRNA vaccines are a deadly toxin, aside from the
[00:31.320 --> 00:37.120]  relentless debilitating spike protein that's keeping everyone who has been jabbed sick.
[00:37.120 --> 00:43.040]  The vaccines contain metals, metals that have been observed to self-assemble outside
[00:43.040 --> 00:49.000]  of the body, and most disturbingly, metals that assemble inside of the body.
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.800]  These show that these metals are found in the blood of 94% of those who have received
[00:54.800 --> 00:56.960]  a COVID vaccine.
[00:56.960 --> 01:03.200]  And these mysterious conglomerates of metal make their final appearance in the dead.
[01:03.200 --> 01:08.720]  All over the world, coroners are now finding that the arteries of the vaccinated have been
[01:08.720 --> 01:15.840]  clogged with mysterious growths, non-organic masses made up of conductive metals such as
[01:15.840 --> 01:19.320]  aluminum, sodium, and tin.
[01:19.320 --> 01:25.280]  This is what's most likely causing all the organ failure and heart attacks, heart attacks
[01:25.280 --> 01:26.280]  in our children.
[01:26.280 --> 01:30.840]  Two days ago, I flew out my first 10-year-old with a heart attack, and I had to fight the
[01:30.840 --> 01:35.720]  doctor in the ER because he's like, 10-year-olds don't have heart attacks, and I argued back
[01:35.720 --> 01:41.920]  and forth for 30 minutes to force his hand to get an EKG to find out that he had almost
[01:41.920 --> 01:48.120]  a complete STEMI, which is ST-elevated myocardial infarction, for which you could see it lit
[01:48.120 --> 01:49.120]  up on the 12-lead EKG.
[01:49.120 --> 01:51.120]  And he's like, well, that's not possible.
[01:51.120 --> 01:53.920]  And I'm like, well, he was just vaccinated yesterday.
[01:53.920 --> 01:56.240]  It is very much possible.
[01:56.240 --> 02:00.200]  At any given time, people are getting ahold of me and the nurse advocates at American
[02:00.200 --> 02:05.760]  Frontline Nurses to help advocate because, as you've seen, there is victim shaming that
[02:05.760 --> 02:11.880]  it's anxiety, oh, it's this, but in actuality, if they put down that it was a vaccine, it
[02:11.880 --> 02:16.800]  was an injury, the physician, the corporation, the hospital, the clinic, they actually won't
[02:16.800 --> 02:20.080]  get reimbursed, so it gets labeled as anxiety.
[02:20.080 --> 02:24.920]  According to the whistleblowers, the doctors are lying about the vaccine deaths to make
[02:24.920 --> 02:26.800]  a few thousand bucks.
[02:26.800 --> 02:32.640]  Is that why Trump has been pushing the deadly shots, killing our own children for a measly
[02:32.640 --> 02:34.360]  million dollars?
[02:34.360 --> 02:39.800]  Now that the truth about the deadly COVID vaccines is finally starting to break free,
[02:39.800 --> 02:45.520]  the mainstream media is shifting their narrative and blaming it all on President Trump.
[02:45.520 --> 02:51.440]  And they've already laid the groundwork back in 2016 when the herd was told to believe
[02:51.440 --> 02:53.960]  that Trump is literally Hitler.
[02:53.960 --> 02:56.760]  We should look at Adolf Hitler in 1929.
[02:56.760 --> 03:01.760]  He was a kind of a funny kind of character that said the things that people were thinking.
[03:01.760 --> 03:05.360]  Where Donald Trump takes it, I have absolutely no idea.
[03:05.360 --> 03:09.000]  But Donald Trump is a dangerous man with the things that he has been saying.
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.080]  You might argue that Trump is innocent, but he doesn't.
[03:13.080 --> 03:17.000]  He brags of all the lives he has saved.
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.440]  And the herd will believe what they are told to believe.
[03:20.440 --> 03:26.000]  It shows you how un-painful that vaccine shot is, so everybody go get your shot.
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.400]  It works incredibly well, 95 percent, maybe even more than that, it works incredibly well.
[03:31.400 --> 03:35.760]  It's a great vaccine, it's a safe vaccine, and it's something that works.
[03:35.760 --> 03:39.720]  I recommend you take it, but I also believe in your freedoms 100 percent.
[03:39.720 --> 03:44.960]  When you have the vaccine, people that do, and it's a very small number, relatively,
[03:44.960 --> 03:47.280]  but people that do get it get better much quicker.
[03:47.280 --> 03:49.600]  It's a very important thing to know.
[03:49.600 --> 03:52.480]  They don't get nearly as thick, and they get better.
[03:52.480 --> 03:53.480]  Lindsey Graham's an example.
[03:53.480 --> 03:56.400]  He said, if I didn't have this vaccine, I would have died.
[03:56.400 --> 03:57.400]  And you know what?
[03:57.400 --> 03:58.600]  I believe totally in your freedoms.
[03:58.600 --> 03:59.600]  I do.
[03:59.600 --> 04:00.600]  You've got to do what you have to do.
[04:00.600 --> 04:03.520]  But I recommend take the vaccines.
[04:03.520 --> 04:04.520]  I did it.
[04:04.520 --> 04:05.520]  It's good.
[04:05.520 --> 04:09.520]  But you got, no, that's okay, that's all right.
[04:09.520 --> 04:13.560]  You got your freedoms, but I happen to take the vaccine.
[04:13.560 --> 04:16.280]  The vaccines do work, and they are effective.
[04:16.280 --> 04:22.280]  I am, I think I saved many, I don't think, I know, I saved millions and millions of lives
[04:22.280 --> 04:23.280]  throughout the world.
[04:23.280 --> 04:25.440]  We could have had another Spanish flu.
[04:25.440 --> 04:30.400]  We could have had, you know, in 1917, close to 100 million people died, they say.
[04:30.400 --> 04:32.160]  But it was really bad.
[04:32.160 --> 04:38.000]  And now other countries are using our vaccines and, you know, tremendous, tremendously successful.
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.200]  You're playing right into their hands when you sort of like, oh, the vaccine, if you
[04:42.200 --> 04:44.880]  don't want to take it, you shouldn't be forced to take it.
[04:44.880 --> 04:45.880]  No mandates.
[04:45.880 --> 04:50.400]  But take credit, because we saved tens of millions of lives.
[04:50.400 --> 04:51.400]  Take credit.
[04:51.400 --> 04:53.040]  Don't let them take that away from you.
[04:53.040 --> 04:54.040]  Okay.
[04:54.040 --> 04:55.040]  So the president made new...
[04:55.040 --> 04:56.040]  Do you agree with that?
[04:56.040 --> 04:57.040]  Right?
[04:57.040 --> 05:01.680]  Oh, yes.
[05:01.680 --> 05:11.400]  You are going to like it here.
[05:11.400 --> 05:17.920]  You are going to like the vaccine?
[05:17.920 --> 05:19.560]  you'll complete products out there.
[05:19.560 --> 05:23.080]  Ours is amongst the very best and it is a lower cost
[05:23.080 --> 05:24.240]  than many of the leading brands.
[05:24.240 --> 05:26.360]  But whatever you do, take a high quality,
[05:26.360 --> 05:29.680]  multi-vitamin mineral amino acid system like this
[05:29.680 --> 05:31.800]  that's liquid that you put in water
[05:31.800 --> 05:35.240]  because you have a better absorption rate when you do that.
[05:35.240 --> 05:36.880]  Now, vitamin mineral fusion is our overall
[05:36.880 --> 05:37.880]  best-selling product.
[05:37.880 --> 05:39.320]  It finally came in a month ago
[05:39.320 --> 05:41.720]  and we've almost sold out of the first shipment.
[05:41.720 --> 05:43.640]  Hopefully more is coming in in a few months.
[05:43.640 --> 05:46.440]  But if you want to experience vitamin mineral fusion
[05:46.440 --> 05:48.640]  and its effects for yourself or maybe you already love it,
[05:48.640 --> 05:49.880]  you want to stock up.
[05:49.880 --> 05:51.160]  Thanks for keeping us on the air
[05:51.160 --> 05:53.080]  and thanks for taking care of yourself and your body.
[05:53.080 --> 05:54.360]  We'll be all going to stick together.
[05:54.360 --> 05:56.800]  Vitamin mineral fusion is 40% off
[05:56.800 --> 05:59.880]  even though it's selling out at infowarstore.com.
[05:59.880 --> 06:01.040]  Thanks for your support.
[06:05.040 --> 06:08.720]  Good afternoon and welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[06:08.720 --> 06:11.720]  It is Sunday, the 28th of August
[06:11.720 --> 06:15.560]  and Alex has graciously asked me to host today's broadcast.
[06:15.560 --> 06:18.920]  I'm Maria Z from Zmedia.com.
[06:18.920 --> 06:21.680]  A couple of weeks ago I was on the Alex Jones show
[06:21.680 --> 06:25.520]  talking about the testing ground of Australia.
[06:25.520 --> 06:27.720]  We are the beta test for the New World Order
[06:27.720 --> 06:29.280]  and that is evidence through everything
[06:29.280 --> 06:30.760]  that we went through.
[06:30.760 --> 06:33.320]  But I've also got evidence for you today
[06:33.320 --> 06:35.160]  of what they call the Melbourne experiment.
[06:35.160 --> 06:38.520]  We're going to be breaking down the smart city agenda,
[06:38.520 --> 06:41.480]  how Australia is being used as the model for the world,
[06:41.480 --> 06:44.600]  the blueprint that they're using for everyone else
[06:44.600 --> 06:48.680]  including the districts where they've got district borders.
[06:48.680 --> 06:51.720]  We'll get into the organisations responsible for this,
[06:51.720 --> 06:54.840]  some of the legislation that has already been passed
[06:54.840 --> 06:58.320]  to put this into action.
[06:58.320 --> 07:01.280]  And then we'll go through some of the news
[07:01.280 --> 07:04.160]  that's travelling at the moment along with some analysis
[07:04.160 --> 07:07.680]  and how this all relates to the global takeover
[07:07.680 --> 07:10.200]  that we are all being subjected to right now.
[07:10.200 --> 07:12.720]  In hour two, we're going to take some calls.
[07:12.720 --> 07:14.120]  We're going to open up the phone lines
[07:14.120 --> 07:17.040]  and we will provide the number for that a little bit later.
[07:17.040 --> 07:21.320]  But I guess what I really want people to understand
[07:21.320 --> 07:28.400]  is the key that made Australia the successful testing ground
[07:28.400 --> 07:31.920]  of their plans was the compliance of our nation.
[07:31.920 --> 07:35.880]  See, we've never really had to fight against our government
[07:35.880 --> 07:37.880]  and I'm not calling for civil unrest here.
[07:37.880 --> 07:41.320]  I'm talking about really stand up against tyranny in our country.
[07:41.320 --> 07:43.640]  We've had it easy here in Australia
[07:43.640 --> 07:47.400]  and because of that, it's just given them an easy ride
[07:47.400 --> 07:53.240]  to take over our will, to take over our entire country.
[07:53.240 --> 07:58.240]  And this is why it is so crucial for people to continue
[07:58.240 --> 07:59.560]  to stand against this.
[07:59.560 --> 08:03.560]  You saw the unbelievable footage coming out of Australia
[08:03.560 --> 08:07.040]  over the past two years of people being tackled to the streets.
[08:07.040 --> 08:09.000]  We had pregnant women being tackled.
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.720]  We had police shooting at protesters.
[08:11.720 --> 08:15.320]  It was absolutely unbelievable what we faced.
[08:15.320 --> 08:18.360]  And so what a lot of people might not be aware of
[08:18.360 --> 08:20.840]  is the fact that we've actually got documents
[08:20.840 --> 08:22.720]  called the Melbourne experiment.
[08:22.720 --> 08:26.880]  If you recall, Melbourne endured some of the worst lockdowns,
[08:26.880 --> 08:31.120]  if not the worst, in the whole world during that time.
[08:31.120 --> 08:37.360]  In fact, six lockdowns, more than 260 days in total.
[08:37.360 --> 08:39.160]  And they've used this as a model.
[08:39.160 --> 08:41.560]  They've literally, within this document,
[08:41.560 --> 08:46.800]  they speak about how this was a living lab for the whole world.
[08:46.800 --> 08:53.800]  They've done surveys to assess human response to these lockdowns.
[08:53.800 --> 08:56.720]  And this is also referenced in this document.
[08:56.720 --> 09:00.200]  So when you analyze this entire thing,
[09:00.200 --> 09:01.880]  we're not going to go through the whole thing today,
[09:01.880 --> 09:04.720]  but there's some key language that I want people to understand.
[09:04.720 --> 09:09.280]  But when you analyze this, it's like they wanted an outcome
[09:09.280 --> 09:12.040]  from this analysis.
[09:12.040 --> 09:15.320]  It's literally reverse engineering the desired outcome.
[09:15.320 --> 09:17.600]  It's produced by the Monash University,
[09:17.600 --> 09:20.800]  one of Australia's most prestigious universities.
[09:20.800 --> 09:24.680]  It just so happens to be the university that's partnering up
[09:24.680 --> 09:29.280]  with Moderna to produce 100 million doses of mRNA injections
[09:29.280 --> 09:30.880]  per year.
[09:30.880 --> 09:33.560]  Why would we need 100 million doses per year?
[09:33.560 --> 09:37.200]  Well, the same reason that we have Vaxis in Queensland
[09:37.200 --> 09:40.520]  producing 300 million doses a year.
[09:40.520 --> 09:44.920]  What does Australia, a population of around about 26 million people,
[09:44.920 --> 09:48.080]  need 400 million doses of injections per year?
[09:48.080 --> 09:53.280]  Well, it's because this is going to be an ongoing cycle of injections.
[09:53.280 --> 09:56.680]  And what they've done with this Melbourne experiment,
[09:56.680 --> 10:04.840]  six lockdowns over 260 days is lab test the Australian people.
[10:04.840 --> 10:08.720]  Like lab rats to see how far they could push them.
[10:08.720 --> 10:12.120]  And unfortunately in Australia, they were quite successful again
[10:12.120 --> 10:15.160]  because we have our she'll be right attitude.
[10:15.160 --> 10:19.240]  And I want people all over the world to never have that attitude again
[10:19.240 --> 10:25.360]  because you saw what they were able to achieve here in Australia.
[10:25.360 --> 10:31.680]  In this particular analysis, there's a section called environmental impacts.
[10:31.680 --> 10:34.520]  They talk about encouraging behaviors that were found
[10:34.520 --> 10:39.400]  to reduce heat levels and air pollution during COVID-19.
[10:39.400 --> 10:42.280]  And this could, of course, include working from home,
[10:42.280 --> 10:45.800]  fewer private vehicles on the roads, so on and so forth.
[10:45.800 --> 10:51.960]  And throughout this document, it's littered with climate change agenda language.
[10:51.960 --> 10:56.760]  And if you recall during the lockdowns, they didn't even wait one moment
[10:56.760 --> 10:58.920]  to start promoting climate lockdowns.
[10:58.920 --> 11:05.640]  We saw images, side-by-side images of different cities with smog in one picture
[11:05.640 --> 11:08.080]  and clear skies in the other.
[11:08.080 --> 11:11.600]  And we know that these images were doctored.
[11:11.600 --> 11:17.200]  You know, later on it was found out through various people on social media
[11:17.200 --> 11:23.080]  who spend the time to investigate these things that these pictures were actually doctored.
[11:23.080 --> 11:27.160]  And it wasn't really the case that all the smog was lifting,
[11:27.160 --> 11:32.720]  but they were prepping you the whole world for climate lockdowns already
[11:32.720 --> 11:38.480]  in the middle of lockdowns, in the middle of all of humanity having their jobs impacted,
[11:38.480 --> 11:42.400]  their livelihood, the ability to feed their families.
[11:42.400 --> 11:46.960]  Every single thing that they did was a conditioning tool.
[11:46.960 --> 11:50.080]  They go on to talk about building back better, of course,
[11:50.080 --> 11:55.640]  the favorite slogan of these psychopaths and the green recovery.
[11:55.640 --> 12:01.560]  Of course, the green recovery because of human-induced climate change, they say.
[12:01.560 --> 12:07.600]  We know that the whole CO2 narrative, there's so much coming out now that that is all a farce.
[12:07.600 --> 12:09.360]  It's unbelievable.
[12:09.360 --> 12:12.760]  You know, they're talking about Mother Earth.
[12:12.760 --> 12:16.480]  We even heard Pelosi recently talking about the mother.
[12:16.480 --> 12:24.880]  This is literally their new religion, just the same way that they used the vaccines
[12:24.880 --> 12:28.040]  to talk about how they're going to save.
[12:28.040 --> 12:37.120]  You know, they pull all of humanity into this task of saving the world.
[12:37.120 --> 12:43.360]  How much more effective is this saving Mother Earth campaign going to be
[12:43.360 --> 12:46.160]  when they say that, you know, it's not just COVID now,
[12:46.160 --> 12:49.440]  it's not just saving the existing people on the planet.
[12:49.440 --> 12:51.960]  We've got to save the future generations.
[12:51.960 --> 12:56.840]  We've got to save the planet for all of the people that are coming, you know,
[12:56.840 --> 13:04.520]  over the next 100 years and how selfish are you if you go outside and breathe.
[13:04.520 --> 13:07.920]  This is literally what they're saying to you.
[13:07.920 --> 13:11.880]  They go on and they've actually had a look here within this document.
[13:11.880 --> 13:17.160]  It's suburban temperature data, the days of the week during lockdown periods.
[13:17.160 --> 13:22.120]  And they're saying that, you know, the team have also been working with the Victorian
[13:22.120 --> 13:29.200]  Environmental Protection Authority, contributing to a global study of 80 to 100 cities.
[13:29.200 --> 13:33.600]  So this isn't just Melbourne in Australia that they're doing this in.
[13:33.600 --> 13:38.240]  I guarantee you they have tested the whole world.
[13:38.240 --> 13:42.400]  You know, it may even be your city that they've done a similar study in.
[13:42.400 --> 13:46.280]  But the problem is that because this is such a multi-layered attack,
[13:46.280 --> 13:51.920]  people don't generally have the time to go and read an entire, you know, 80-page report.
[13:51.920 --> 13:54.960]  This one's not 80 pages, but many of them are.
[13:54.960 --> 13:58.480]  Even over that, to go and dissect all of these documents.
[13:58.480 --> 14:03.440]  And again, I say most of the time there is a desired outcome.
[14:03.440 --> 14:09.440]  Of course, the new desired outcome is their new cult religion of climate change.
[14:09.440 --> 14:12.680]  And everything that they do within these studies,
[14:12.680 --> 14:18.920]  within these documents is geared towards that desired outcome of problem,
[14:18.920 --> 14:23.200]  creating the problem and giving you the solution,
[14:23.200 --> 14:30.280]  which of course always results in more and more of your civil liberties being eroded.
[14:30.280 --> 14:38.520]  You know, they talk about humans contributing to urban warmth through anthropogenic emissions.
[14:38.520 --> 14:44.480]  This is talking about breathing. They're saying that your breath
[14:44.480 --> 14:48.840]  contributes to global warming.
[14:48.840 --> 14:52.480]  What are they going to do to stop you from breathing?
[14:52.480 --> 14:58.840]  Well, the whole plan is to lock you in your city, your little smart city,
[14:58.840 --> 15:02.200]  and limit you to 30 minutes of travel.
[15:02.200 --> 15:07.240]  That is what everything that I'll be going through today proves.
[15:07.240 --> 15:11.080]  And it's not just Australian studies that are showing this.
[15:11.080 --> 15:13.760]  This is in line with what the United Nations is planning.
[15:13.760 --> 15:16.120]  They praise the Melbourne experiment.
[15:16.120 --> 15:23.440]  They praise Australia's response to COVID-19 like we somehow handled it.
[15:23.440 --> 15:27.280]  How many times did we hear in the media that Australia responded so well
[15:27.280 --> 15:28.920]  and we've managed the pandemic?
[15:28.920 --> 15:33.920]  Meanwhile, because we're such a highly injected population,
[15:33.920 --> 15:40.480]  our hospitalizations are through the roof, our injected deaths are through the roof,
[15:40.480 --> 15:45.000]  and this is happening globally because of this clot shot.
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.320]  We'll be back right after the break to break down more of these smart cities,
[15:50.320 --> 15:56.440]  locking you into your home no more than 30 minutes of travel right after the break.
[15:56.440 --> 16:03.680]  Just look at these headlines from Reuters.
[16:03.680 --> 16:09.440]  World Faces on Precedented Global Hunger Crisis, UN chief says, going into 2023.
[16:09.440 --> 16:15.480]  World Food Program warns of global food catastrophe, looming global catastrophe.
[16:15.480 --> 16:21.000]  The world could run out of food by 2023, major studies say, and the reports go on and on.
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.680]  We told you this was a designed program by the globalist two and a half years ago.
[16:24.680 --> 16:29.480]  We told you energy and food prices would explode and now they're up more than 40% of the U.S. alone.
[16:29.480 --> 16:31.680]  Some areas of the world are up over 100%.
[16:31.680 --> 16:35.320]  The only way you beat inflation and protect yourself and your family is with high-quality
[16:35.320 --> 16:42.800]  food ready to ship right now at preparetoday.com and a very rare sale of 10% off site-wide.
[16:42.800 --> 16:46.520]  Not just for food, but survival and preparedness items is happening right now.
[16:46.520 --> 16:53.240]  10% off at preparetoday.com and on top of it, any order above $99 gets free shipping.
[16:53.240 --> 16:55.760]  I think that is a huge part of the cost of horrible food.
[16:55.760 --> 17:00.280]  So go to preparetoday.com and protect yourself and your family while you still can.
[17:00.280 --> 17:05.320]  We brought the game-changing product previously only available to major oil companies around
[17:05.320 --> 17:11.120]  the world to the civilian market two years ago, the BioProse, for septic tanks, for porta-potties,
[17:11.120 --> 17:13.640]  for RVs, for your drains, your boats.
[17:13.640 --> 17:14.640]  It goes on and on.
[17:14.640 --> 17:19.680]  It'll eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water, but it's been so successful
[17:19.680 --> 17:26.240]  now we're selling it to major RV parks, pig farms, you name it, because this stuff will
[17:26.240 --> 17:35.760]  eat anything that is organic and it's exclusively available at thebioprose.com and now infowarstore.com.
[17:35.760 --> 17:41.080]  We sold out of this for almost a year, but we made a major purchase and it is now in

[20:00.920 --> 20:07.920]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:07.920 --> 20:19.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[20:19.200 --> 20:22.680]  I'm your host today, Maria Z from Zmedia.com.
[20:22.680 --> 20:28.560]  It is Sunday the 28th of August and Alex has graciously asked me to host this Sunday's
[20:28.560 --> 20:29.560]  broadcast.
[20:29.560 --> 20:33.760]  We're talking about why the statement that Australia is the testing ground of the New
[20:33.760 --> 20:39.200]  World Order is absolutely irrefutable and why it's important for you to know and understand
[20:39.200 --> 20:44.400]  the tactics that they used in our country to make sure that they don't do the same thing
[20:44.400 --> 20:45.400]  to you.
[20:45.400 --> 20:51.160]  I truly believe that in order to fight something or stand against something, you have to know
[20:51.160 --> 20:52.720]  what you're standing against.
[20:52.720 --> 20:58.160]  So we're talking about the Melbourne experiment, a document produced by Monash University
[20:58.160 --> 21:05.000]  and the fact that they are saying that humans contribute to urban warmth through anthropogenic
[21:05.000 --> 21:09.360]  emissions, essentially telling you that you are not allowed to breathe.
[21:09.360 --> 21:15.000]  They speak about the air pollution levels for Melbourne and regionally from satellite
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.480]  observations were drastically reduced during lockdown.
[21:18.480 --> 21:24.320]  So all of the benefits of lockdowns, we know that what they say are benefits of lockdowns.
[21:24.320 --> 21:29.800]  We know that lockdowns achieve nothing as far as the virus or so-called virus is concerned,
[21:29.800 --> 21:36.280]  but really for their plans, these lockdowns are something that they have planned ongoing
[21:36.280 --> 21:42.720]  because their new religion of climate change and Mother Earth is going to be something that
[21:42.720 --> 21:45.440]  they so viciously protect.
[21:45.440 --> 21:52.320]  So they used Australia and Melbourne in particular, again, over 260 days in lockdown as the beta
[21:52.320 --> 21:57.200]  test to see how long they could keep people locked in their homes, how far they could
[21:57.200 --> 22:00.280]  push the people for the greater good.
[22:00.280 --> 22:04.600]  And this is exactly what they're going to do next time when it comes to climate lockdowns
[22:04.600 --> 22:06.960]  and mark my words, that will happen.
[22:06.960 --> 22:13.240]  They go on to talk about recommendation for a post COVID-19 recovery of the world and
[22:13.240 --> 22:19.760]  they say that they want to encourage behaviors that were found to reduce heat levels and
[22:19.760 --> 22:21.840]  pollution during COVID-19.
[22:21.840 --> 22:26.280]  This could include working from home and fewer private vehicles on the road.
[22:26.280 --> 22:28.240]  So let's talk about working from home.
[22:28.240 --> 22:32.920]  Working from home is great, you know, it gives people flexibility.
[22:32.920 --> 22:36.200]  It allows them to reduce their spending.
[22:36.200 --> 22:43.040]  It also gives your employer the opportunity to not increase your wages because they say
[22:43.040 --> 22:46.800]  that your costs of getting to work are less.
[22:46.800 --> 22:50.760]  It also completely reduces the human interaction.
[22:50.760 --> 22:54.480]  How many people were depressed during lockdowns because they were working from home?
[22:54.480 --> 22:57.360]  They couldn't handle being on zooms all the time.
[22:57.360 --> 23:02.920]  They want to limit that human interaction as much as possible because they're conditioning
[23:02.920 --> 23:09.280]  you for the metaverse because life under their complete totalitarian dystopian nightmare is
[23:09.280 --> 23:14.640]  going to be so unbearable that you'll be so depressed sitting in your lounge room wanting
[23:14.640 --> 23:22.200]  to escape reality that you plug into the metaverse, a fake reality where you can create some sort
[23:22.200 --> 23:28.640]  of a life that isn't so horrible and I'm not exaggerating here because they want you depressed.
[23:28.640 --> 23:30.440]  They want you weak.
[23:30.440 --> 23:32.160]  They want you malnourished.
[23:32.160 --> 23:33.320]  They plan on doing it.
[23:33.320 --> 23:39.840]  They plan on reducing your ability to eat meat and nutrients, codex alimentarius.
[23:39.840 --> 23:44.720]  Let's call poisons, nutrients, let's call nutrients poisons.
[23:44.720 --> 23:49.920]  Let's reclassify everything that's good for you as a poison and this is exactly what they've
[23:49.920 --> 23:50.920]  done.
[23:50.920 --> 23:54.360]  They've been rewriting knowledge.
[23:54.360 --> 23:59.840]  They've been rewriting knowledge and so everything that they do and plan in these documents,
[23:59.840 --> 24:06.840]  again, it's like a reverse of a study where they say, well, here's our desired outcome
[24:06.840 --> 24:09.800]  and we're going to tell you what you need.
[24:09.800 --> 24:12.600]  We're going to tell you what's good for you.
[24:12.600 --> 24:16.680]  You don't get to decide for yourself anymore.
[24:16.680 --> 24:25.600]  It even goes on to say this will be tested in a living lab through real-world experimentation
[24:25.600 --> 24:30.720]  and again, I said earlier, they've said that it is a test that's happening in collaboration
[24:30.720 --> 24:35.920]  with between 80 to 100 cities worldwide so it could be your city that you live in.
[24:35.920 --> 24:42.440]  You don't even know that they're using the language that this is a living lab test.
[24:42.440 --> 24:46.800]  They consider you a lab rat.
[24:46.800 --> 24:48.160]  I spoke to someone recently.
[24:48.160 --> 24:54.440]  I was out in public and a lady said to me, oh, I recognize you from the internet and
[24:54.440 --> 25:01.440]  she said, but I stopped tuning in because COVID's done now and everything's back to normal.
[25:01.440 --> 25:04.440]  I said, you have no idea, do you?
[25:04.440 --> 25:08.680]  You have no idea that you were the lab rat.
[25:08.680 --> 25:14.040]  They tested on you to see how far you could go and they are banking on you believing that
[25:14.040 --> 25:16.640]  things are just going back to normal.
[25:16.640 --> 25:22.200]  Little do you know that you're going to be trapped in this little smart city confined
[25:22.200 --> 25:30.240]  to a 30-minute perimeter and I'll show you that in a moment.
[25:30.240 --> 25:35.960]  They talk about digital technology in this document and they say the successful contact
[25:35.960 --> 25:42.160]  tracing, tracking, screening and testing rely on innovative technology and have been used
[25:42.160 --> 25:44.800]  globally to contain and mitigate the virus.
[25:44.800 --> 25:47.000]  Well, there's been no mitigation of the virus.
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.320]  There's no containment of the virus that's actually happened.
[25:50.320 --> 25:51.320]  That's a lie.
[25:51.320 --> 25:57.440]  In fact, all of the evidence is showing us that these injections are actually self-spreading.
[25:57.440 --> 26:00.340]  They spread the spike protein.
[26:00.340 --> 26:01.840]  They spread people.
[26:01.840 --> 26:03.840]  I've heard reports.
[26:03.840 --> 26:09.860]  I get people all the time in my telegram channel saying, I spent time in a car with people
[26:09.860 --> 26:13.320]  that were recently injected and now I have all these symptoms.
[26:13.320 --> 26:17.080]  People that have treated vaccine-injured people have all these symptoms.
[26:17.080 --> 26:22.800]  There's no mitigation of the virus, but they talk about it, successful contact tracing,
[26:22.800 --> 26:27.560]  tracking and screening and you already know that they're preparing us for the next pandemic.
[26:27.560 --> 26:30.640]  Bill Gates has spoken about this openly.
[26:30.640 --> 26:32.680]  We have to prepare for the next pandemic.
[26:32.680 --> 26:41.680]  This is the reason why Australia is creating this vaccine economy because we're preparing
[26:41.680 --> 26:42.680]  for the next pandemic.
[26:42.680 --> 26:43.680]  Hang on a second.
[26:43.680 --> 26:51.720]  When we told that this was a one in 100-year event, when we told that this is a rare event,
[26:51.720 --> 26:56.920]  why is it that we are being conditioned now to accept the fact that pandemics are just
[26:56.920 --> 26:59.120]  a normal way of life?
[26:59.120 --> 27:00.920]  Viruses are a normal way of life.
[27:00.920 --> 27:02.560]  This is just the norm now.
[27:02.560 --> 27:04.560]  Well, I don't know.
[27:04.560 --> 27:10.080]  Maybe it's got to do with all of the research happening in the biolabs where they can just
[27:10.080 --> 27:18.080]  program their little virus through AI and all of the DNA testing that they've been doing,
[27:18.080 --> 27:24.520]  the gene collecting, the DNA collecting all across the globe, enables them to just program
[27:24.520 --> 27:28.440]  something to kill the next lot of people off.
[27:28.440 --> 27:30.200]  This is literally the world that we're living in.
[27:30.200 --> 27:35.220]  It sounds totally crazy, but I know that the people that tune into this broadcast are switched
[27:35.220 --> 27:39.680]  on intelligent people and I know that you all know that what I'm saying is absolutely
[27:39.680 --> 27:40.680]  correct.
[27:40.680 --> 27:44.920]  Alex has been warning us about this for years.
[27:44.920 --> 27:49.440]  Back to the Melbourne experiment document and I'll move on from this document in a minute,
[27:49.440 --> 27:50.440]  but this is crucial.
[27:50.440 --> 27:56.720]  This opens up a wide and novel research domain where the internet can be reconceptualized
[27:56.720 --> 28:02.880]  as a human behavioral laboratory at a global scale.
[28:02.880 --> 28:10.280]  They are telling you that the internet will be reconceptualized as a human behavioral
[28:10.280 --> 28:14.560]  laboratory at a global scale.
[28:14.560 --> 28:18.760]  In the next segment, I'm going to go into what the United Nations has to say about the
[28:18.760 --> 28:23.040]  Melbourne experiment and then talk to you about the smart cities that are already planned
[28:23.040 --> 28:24.040]  here in Australia.
[28:24.040 --> 28:29.560]  I've touched on this with Alex the last time I was on his show.
[28:29.560 --> 28:34.360]  We've literally got street furniture that's going to monitor human behavior.
[28:34.360 --> 28:40.840]  You've got the internet of things where every single person that's in the city, everything
[28:40.840 --> 28:44.120]  you do is going to be visible to the person next to you.
[28:44.120 --> 28:45.120]  You'll be self-policing.
[28:45.120 --> 28:49.640]  Do you think censorship is bad now where we have to use silly words on social media to
[28:49.640 --> 28:51.040]  cover the truth?
[28:51.040 --> 28:52.720]  Wait until your neighbor is policing you.
[28:52.720 --> 29:00.320]  We'll be right back in the next segment.
[29:00.320 --> 29:05.120]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular
[29:05.120 --> 29:10.760]  system, for your brain, for every part of your body, but what I don't see being promoted
[29:10.760 --> 29:17.120]  is the fact that it has natural, psychotropic effects.
[29:17.120 --> 29:18.120]  It certainly does for me.
[29:18.120 --> 29:22.920]  When I take a couple of these capsules from an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are
[29:22.920 --> 29:23.920]  amazing.
[29:23.920 --> 29:30.360]  Now, there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain,
[29:30.360 --> 29:32.800]  but I want you to experience it yourself.
[29:32.800 --> 29:36.320]  We know it's good for your heart, we know it's good for your brain, we know it's good
[29:36.320 --> 29:40.880]  for your arteries and veins and your lungs and every other function of your body, but
[29:40.880 --> 29:46.040]  I want you to experience this high-grade fish oil, this ultimate fish oil at infowarstore.com
[29:46.040 --> 29:49.760]  and see what it does if you take it before bedtime.
[29:49.760 --> 29:54.960]  Ultimate fish oil, 50% off, now exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[29:54.960 --> 29:55.960]  Thank you all for your support.
[29:55.960 --> 29:59.560]  You're really going to miss out if you don't get it.
[29:59.560 --> 30:06.560]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here and that's
[30:06.560 --> 30:11.120]  what people recognize and resonate with and as Ward said, you're not going to find a
[30:11.120 --> 30:13.360]  better place for information.
[30:13.360 --> 30:16.720]  You might not agree with everything, you might not agree with all our perspectives, but we
[30:16.720 --> 30:21.360]  cover all the information and there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[30:21.360 --> 30:22.800]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[30:22.800 --> 30:27.000]  infowarstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, infowarstore.com is where to
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.960]  get them, folks, and we do have the best supplements.
[30:29.960 --> 30:36.400]  Just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, we do the best with our
[30:36.400 --> 30:38.680]  supplements as well.
[30:38.680 --> 30:42.280]  Look at the hair and beard support formula, folks, this is a joke.
[30:42.280 --> 30:46.800]  We're giving this thing away, it's 75% off, by the way, it works for me in case you haven't
[30:46.800 --> 30:47.800]  noticed.
[30:47.800 --> 30:54.520]  The hair and beard formula is working for me quite well, I might add, quite well.
[30:54.520 --> 30:59.280]  My barber appreciates hair and beard support for men, I go and see them quite often now.
[30:59.280 --> 31:04.680]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[31:04.680 --> 31:09.240]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages, and the studies are all clear.
[31:09.240 --> 31:15.880]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there's problems in the bedroom and the number
[31:15.880 --> 31:19.600]  one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[31:19.600 --> 31:23.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people
[31:23.280 --> 31:27.840]  having lasting good love and relationships, they want to break up society, and we are
[31:27.840 --> 31:35.040]  so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world available
[31:35.040 --> 31:36.800]  as a major sponsor now.
[31:36.800 --> 31:43.680]  Go to theironpatriot.com today, theironpatriot.com, and watch the instructional video, look at
[31:43.680 --> 31:46.680]  the science yourself, and then get a bottle of InstaHeart.
[31:46.680 --> 31:50.640]  It's discreet shipping, I've used it, it's amazing, and it's not just for folks that
[31:50.640 --> 31:52.120]  have problems in the bedroom.
[31:52.120 --> 31:56.560]  This also enhances it, so again, get yours today at theironpatriot.com.
[32:26.360 --> 32:28.280]  I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[32:28.280 --> 32:31.520]  I'm going to wake up today, you know what, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to
[32:31.520 --> 32:33.880]  make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[32:33.880 --> 32:36.240]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[32:36.240 --> 32:39.040]  I don't think that happens very often, it's never happened to me, I've never had anyone
[32:39.040 --> 32:42.400]  knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy, how can I improve your life in
[32:42.400 --> 32:43.400]  every single way?
[32:43.400 --> 32:45.880]  There's only one person who woke up and fought that, and that was me.
[32:45.880 --> 32:49.120]  I woke up and fought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want
[32:49.120 --> 32:51.920]  to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to infowars.com, take control
[32:51.920 --> 32:54.160]  of your health right now and support the resistance.
[32:54.160 --> 32:57.560]  Don't buy into the group thing, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the turbo force.
[32:57.560 --> 33:00.640]  Kool-Aid's bad and the turbo force is good.
[33:00.640 --> 33:14.440]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:14.440 --> 33:18.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Sunday broadcast.
[33:18.760 --> 33:25.320]  I'm your host, Maria Z from Zmedia.com, we're talking about the plan of the globalist to
[33:25.320 --> 33:31.080]  enslave the whole world in 30-minute smart cities based on the Melbourne experiment right
[33:31.080 --> 33:34.960]  here in the testing ground of the New World Order that is Australia.
[33:34.960 --> 33:40.760]  So we went through a Monash University document, now we're talking about the UN Chronicle,
[33:40.760 --> 33:46.640]  which is dated the 28th of January, 2021, where they referenced the Melbourne experiment.
[33:46.640 --> 33:51.240]  They said COVID-19, sustainable development, and the Melbourne experiment.
[33:51.240 --> 33:57.840]  So they are talking about, within this document, the Melbourne experiment to build back better.
[33:57.840 --> 34:00.400]  Governments need to do this, that, and the other.
[34:00.400 --> 34:05.440]  I won't bore you with the details, but basically in here, they've talked about a survey of
[34:05.440 --> 34:11.320]  COVID-19 responses to understand behavior, scrub they call it, and of course, all of
[34:11.320 --> 34:16.600]  these people went in and completed this survey, which is essentially just human data collection
[34:16.600 --> 34:19.760]  which is what they've been doing this whole time.
[34:19.760 --> 34:26.320]  They call it a living lab, this Melbourne experiment, and the UN is so proud of it because
[34:26.320 --> 34:28.000]  this is what they want to do to everyone.
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.760]  They want to treat you all like lab rats.
[34:30.760 --> 34:35.640]  And then these people go and complete these surveys thinking they're helping the government
[34:35.640 --> 34:37.240]  do better next time.
[34:37.240 --> 34:42.920]  You're contributing to their data collection and the problem, but here's the thing, eventually
[34:42.920 --> 34:48.560]  we won't even need to do surveys because everything will be visible in the Internet of Things.
[34:48.560 --> 34:51.160]  You'll be policed.
[34:51.160 --> 34:56.480]  Every move that you make, every thought that you have that's linked to their Internet of
[34:56.480 --> 35:01.360]  Things will be publicly available, so you'll be self-policing, so terrified to even have
[35:01.360 --> 35:05.840]  an independent thought, and that is the reality of where these people want to go if we don't
[35:05.840 --> 35:08.160]  stop them and if we don't wake people up.
[35:08.160 --> 35:13.880]  They go on to talk about the Melbourne Digital City Model in this UN report.
[35:13.880 --> 35:18.400]  And it says that the project is conducting a pilot in Melbourne investigating how to
[35:18.400 --> 35:25.080]  plan and design 20-minute neighbourhoods in the post-COVID-19 city already in January
[35:25.080 --> 35:26.080]  of 2021.
[35:26.080 --> 35:27.800]  They're talking about 20-minute neighbourhoods.
[35:27.800 --> 35:30.560]  Now, again, they say 20 minutes.
[35:30.560 --> 35:36.520]  The plan really is for a 30-minute city, and that is evidenced in a number of places.
[35:36.520 --> 35:43.480]  But what I want to talk to you about is the organisation CLARA, which stands for the Consolidated
[35:43.480 --> 35:46.480]  Land and Rail Australia.
[35:46.480 --> 35:53.920]  This organisation, CLARA, they've posted the high-speed rail.
[35:53.920 --> 35:57.720]  They're talking about the smart cities that they're going to be pioneering on the east
[35:57.720 --> 36:03.600]  coast of Australia, which just so happens to be the place that's getting rain constantly.
[36:03.600 --> 36:08.760]  We've been told it's been blamed on Leninia, which of course is not a new thing, but we've
[36:08.760 --> 36:11.520]  been told that it's going to happen for the next six months.
[36:11.520 --> 36:16.480]  We're going to have wild weather, and this is, of course, due to climate change immediately.
[36:16.480 --> 36:19.360]  We've declared a climate emergency in one of our states.
[36:19.360 --> 36:26.520]  We've now got a climate change bill in Australia that's passed Parliament with no pushback.
[36:26.520 --> 36:33.520]  Mind you, within the climate change bill of 2022, there is zero detail on how there
[36:33.520 --> 36:36.040]  are actually going to tackle climate change.
[36:36.040 --> 36:37.360]  There are zero strategies.
[36:37.360 --> 36:44.160]  It just references the Paris Agreement of 2015, which, again, has no strategies.
[36:44.160 --> 36:52.200]  It talks about gender equality being a climate change problem and how climate change impacts
[36:52.200 --> 36:58.920]  women's domestic duties, but zero solutions as to how they're actually going to fight
[36:58.920 --> 36:59.920]  it.
[36:59.920 --> 37:03.200]  Of course, we know that all of their plans for alternative energy.
[37:03.200 --> 37:05.120]  I mean, they're not even ready for that.
[37:05.120 --> 37:06.120]  It's just unbelievable.
[37:06.120 --> 37:10.960]  But I want the team to play a quick, this quick clip from Clara and then we'll break
[37:10.960 --> 37:17.680]  down that clip because everything that they do is they present to you this wonderful idea
[37:17.680 --> 37:19.640]  and it sounds great.
[37:19.640 --> 37:21.480]  This is the modern age of propaganda.
[37:21.480 --> 37:23.080]  This is how they do it.
[37:23.080 --> 37:30.640]  This is modern warfare lying to you, telling you that what they're offering you is good
[37:30.640 --> 37:33.120]  and you don't need your former way of living.
[37:33.120 --> 37:35.160]  You don't need traditional family values.
[37:35.160 --> 37:39.640]  You don't need to have freedom of movement because we're going to offer you a solution
[37:39.640 --> 37:44.200]  that's good for the planet and saving the koalas or whatever, but here's the clip of
[37:44.200 --> 37:55.000]  Clara if the team have got it ready and then we'll do an analysis on that.
[37:55.000 --> 38:00.040]  Spread across the globe, there are cities considered the most livable in the world.
[38:00.040 --> 38:04.760]  Cities such as Melbourne, Copenhagen, Vienna and Geneva.
[38:04.760 --> 38:11.040]  Understanding what makes these cities attractive is a key factor in planning for the future.
[38:11.040 --> 38:13.760]  Highly livable cities share a bunch of attributes.
[38:13.760 --> 38:15.680]  They're walkable and have good public transport.
[38:15.680 --> 38:17.840]  They have jobs and educational opportunities.
[38:17.840 --> 38:22.720]  You feel safe, connected to the people in your neighbourhood and you like living there
[38:22.720 --> 38:25.960]  because it has its own unique sense of place and character.
[38:25.960 --> 38:33.320]  Add to that affordable housing and lifestyle and well, who wouldn't want to live there?
[38:33.320 --> 38:34.960]  Livable, sustainable, connected.
[38:34.960 --> 38:38.040]  That's what makes a city attractive.
[38:38.040 --> 38:42.560]  It's also what makes it a hub for economic, social and cultural life.
[38:42.560 --> 38:47.520]  Livable means that a city's design is human centric, neighbourhood-based, vibrant and
[38:47.520 --> 38:48.520]  affordable.
[38:48.520 --> 38:54.360]  A sustainable city is self-sufficient, uses less energy and enables a more environmentally
[38:54.360 --> 38:56.360]  aware lifestyle.
[38:56.360 --> 39:02.480]  A connected city includes physical connections, technological networks and human relationships.
[39:02.480 --> 39:07.480]  The Clara Plan brings together six place pillars to create livable, sustainable and connected
[39:07.480 --> 39:08.960]  cities.
[39:08.960 --> 39:12.680]  These pillars, or founding principles, are the key to Clara's long-term success and
[39:12.680 --> 39:15.640]  underpin every aspect of design and planning.
[39:15.640 --> 39:20.360]  By focusing on people and place from the start, the cities will naturally continue to attract
[39:20.360 --> 39:32.800]  new residents, businesses, creativity and ideas.
[39:32.800 --> 39:39.800]  So, they kept repeating the words liveable, highly liveable.
[39:39.800 --> 39:44.960]  Well, what's not liveable about the places that we live now?
[39:44.960 --> 39:48.160]  What's not liveable about a rural area?
[39:48.160 --> 39:53.520]  Why do you need to keep reminding us that these cities are liveable?
[39:53.520 --> 39:56.840]  What is it about the country that's not liveable?
[39:56.840 --> 40:00.680]  What is it about living in the mountains that's not liveable?
[40:00.680 --> 40:04.640]  The level of thinking and propaganda that's gone into this language, and these people
[40:04.640 --> 40:09.840]  understand the power of words, so they use specific language when they sell you their
[40:09.840 --> 40:10.840]  ideas.
[40:10.840 --> 40:17.040]  And the problem here is, you know, the whole idea of a smart city, sure, it's great.
[40:17.040 --> 40:20.560]  I don't have to travel more than half an hour to get to work.
[40:20.560 --> 40:25.600]  A lot of people, you know, especially here in Sydney, my goodness, two hours, sometimes
[40:25.600 --> 40:28.120]  in the car in peak hour traffic, fair enough.
[40:28.120 --> 40:32.280]  But the problem is that they don't want to give you the choice of living in these highly
[40:32.280 --> 40:33.880]  liveable cities.
[40:33.880 --> 40:37.960]  They want to push you into living into these highly liveable cities, which is why they
[40:37.960 --> 40:41.120]  have to keep marketing it that way.
[40:41.120 --> 40:45.480]  Because they don't want people living in urban areas, and shortly we'll go through
[40:45.480 --> 40:51.400]  the map, one of the maps here in Australia, in Sydney, where they plan on splitting the
[40:51.400 --> 40:55.880]  city up into three districts, what they call districts.
[40:55.880 --> 41:02.040]  And it actually has the borders of where they don't want you to go past.
[41:02.040 --> 41:06.200]  Now, they don't say that, and we'll get into that in a moment.
[41:06.200 --> 41:11.840]  But going back to this Clara video, so they talk about connected.
[41:11.840 --> 41:16.800]  Now, in the government grants for all of the smart cities, and there are many different
[41:16.800 --> 41:20.920]  projects that are happening in Australia, I broke this down a while ago, you can find
[41:20.920 --> 41:25.000]  it on my website, Australia's Smart Cities Revealed.
[41:25.000 --> 41:32.160]  They talk about smart lights, smart parking, all of these things are great concepts.
[41:32.160 --> 41:36.720]  But then there's also street furniture that monitors human behaviour and reports back
[41:36.720 --> 41:38.920]  to the internet of things.
[41:38.920 --> 41:45.000]  Of course, this is sold as we're going to monitor pedestrian activity to help us manage
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.640]  traffic and manage the movement of people.
[41:47.640 --> 41:50.880]  Well, what do you need to manage the movement of people for?
[41:50.880 --> 41:56.080]  It really is about linking everyone to the internet of things, and how are they going
[41:56.080 --> 41:57.080]  to achieve that?
[41:57.080 --> 42:02.160]  Well, that's going to be through digital ID, we'll talk about digital ID a bit later
[42:02.160 --> 42:06.560]  on in the broadcast, but basically, this is already happening.
[42:06.560 --> 42:12.160]  Here in Australia, you've got directors of companies that are not able to continue being
[42:12.160 --> 42:15.320]  a director unless they get a digital ID.
[42:15.320 --> 42:20.120]  This isn't something that's coming, this is already here.
[42:20.120 --> 42:29.320]  This is already here in Australia, compulsory, mandatory, one number, a universal number,
[42:29.320 --> 42:34.560]  international, everyone in the world will know your number, or every global government
[42:34.560 --> 42:38.600]  will know your number, and you can't conduct business without it.
[42:38.600 --> 42:43.200]  And you keep that number for the rest of your life, and it's linked to your bank account,
[42:43.200 --> 42:49.520]  it's linked to your credit cards, it's linked to your home energy consumption.
[42:49.520 --> 42:55.480]  And ultimately, your social credit score will be back right after this break to delve more
[42:55.480 --> 42:59.200]  into all of those topics.
[42:59.200 --> 43:05.160]  The fish oil is back in stock at infowarstore.com, what does the ultimate mean?
[43:05.160 --> 43:09.560]  That's just our name for the best, the highest grade.
[43:09.560 --> 43:16.600]  What this concentrated and chovy oil, pure arctic krill oil, and high quality wild caught
[43:16.600 --> 43:22.400]  salmon oil does for your brain, your heart, your cardiovascular system, and for your
[43:22.400 --> 43:25.880]  entire body's functions is insane.
[43:25.880 --> 43:31.000]  Pure low grade fish oil in all the studies does outstanding things.
[43:31.000 --> 43:37.040]  This is the highest grade, it's not been pasteurized, it's not been boiled, so it has its original
[43:37.040 --> 43:38.040]  effects intact.
[43:38.040 --> 43:43.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, everybody should visit infowarstore.com today and get ultimate fish
[43:43.840 --> 43:47.520]  oil finally back in stock for 50% off.

[43:55.840 --> 43:58.560]  some before bedtime and see what happens with your dreams.
[43:58.560 --> 44:02.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, if millions of people get this book, our funding problems will be
[44:02.040 --> 44:03.920]  over and it's starting to happen.
[44:03.920 --> 44:07.440]  That's why I said, yeah, go to infowarstore.com, get the book and start shipping in a couple
[44:07.440 --> 44:08.440]  of weeks.
[44:08.440 --> 44:09.440]  The great reset in the war for the world.
[44:09.440 --> 44:13.680]  But I said, go to Amazon because it's the number one book chart in the world and if
[44:13.680 --> 44:17.800]  it goes to number one, not a political, not of history, not of US history, it's already
[44:17.800 --> 44:22.360]  number one over 40 categories like political science, you name it, 40 plus categories
[44:22.360 --> 44:23.360]  is number one.
[44:23.360 --> 44:28.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, drum roll please of books in the world.
[44:28.760 --> 44:34.720]  The great reset in the war for the world is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[44:34.720 --> 44:39.440]  We are now number nine in the world.
[44:39.440 --> 44:44.640]  This is major, this is political, this could fund our war chest, just go to amazon.com
[44:44.640 --> 44:50.720]  everybody and buy 10 copies, send this blueprint to the death star and the new world order
[44:50.720 --> 44:53.760]  because you read this, you know their whole plan how to stop them, get the great reset
[44:53.760 --> 44:59.600]  in the war for the world now, it's going to go to number one, what do you make of that?
[44:59.600 --> 45:07.280]  DNA Force Plus, after almost a year of being out of stock, is now exclusively available
[45:07.280 --> 45:09.280]  at infowarstore.com.

[45:22.640 --> 45:28.000]  this great product funds the info war which defends liberty and freedom and your second
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.800]  amendment and your first amendment and so much more at a critical time.
[45:32.800 --> 45:38.880]  So it is a true 360 win-win situation when you go to infowarstore.com and get DNA Force
[45:38.880 --> 45:43.360]  Plus finally our flagship product back in stock.
[45:43.360 --> 45:48.360]  It keeps us on the air and it's going to sell out quick but despite that we're offering
[45:48.360 --> 45:57.240]  it for 50% off at infowarstore.com to support our long-time viewers and listeners and for
[45:57.240 --> 45:59.480]  new folks to take advantage of it.
[45:59.480 --> 46:03.640]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer or
[46:03.640 --> 46:08.520]  rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these
[46:08.520 --> 46:09.520]  profiles.
[46:09.520 --> 46:10.520]  You see it every year.
[46:10.520 --> 46:15.320]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers
[46:15.320 --> 46:21.000]  and almost all of them just screw you over especially the big firms and the big tax groups
[46:21.000 --> 46:24.640]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[46:24.640 --> 46:25.640]  this and knowing this.
[46:25.640 --> 46:31.240]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[46:31.240 --> 46:34.280]  to be able to do things tax wise.
[46:34.280 --> 46:36.800]  It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your money.
[46:36.800 --> 46:42.240]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[46:42.240 --> 46:49.400]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com
[46:49.400 --> 46:56.200]  or call 833-900-4285.
[46:56.200 --> 47:00.800]  833-942-85.
[47:00.800 --> 47:14.600]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:14.600 --> 47:18.520]  Welcome back to this Sunday's broadcast of the Alex Jones show.
[47:18.520 --> 47:22.640]  I'm your host, Maria Z from Zmedia.com with threes.
[47:22.640 --> 47:28.800]  We're talking about smart cities and the plan for total global enslavement through these
[47:28.800 --> 47:31.640]  smart cities that they're not really giving you a choice about.
[47:31.640 --> 47:33.240]  They want you in those cities.
[47:33.240 --> 47:37.800]  We know that the World Economic Forum said that people will be pushed into urban areas
[47:37.800 --> 47:42.720]  as part of Agenda 2030 and this is exactly what this is all about.
[47:42.720 --> 47:47.360]  We've got mainstream media here in Australia reporting on building back better for the
[47:47.360 --> 47:48.880]  Lismore flood victims.
[47:48.880 --> 47:53.960]  Over 50,000 people reportedly displaced from their homes as a result of this flooding.
[47:53.960 --> 47:56.440]  And they're openly telling us about their cloud seeding projects.
[47:56.440 --> 48:02.400]  We just had, I believe it was Japan talking about how proud they are about weather modification
[48:02.400 --> 48:05.360]  and I mean, you know, they don't even hide this stuff anymore.
[48:05.360 --> 48:11.000]  But I want to get into this website, greatercities.au where they actually talk about these districts.
[48:11.000 --> 48:16.960]  And this is where the team did a great job before they brought up the map of the districts.
[48:16.960 --> 48:21.320]  It describes the plan to split Sydney, the city of Sydney, into a metropolis of three
[48:21.320 --> 48:25.120]  cities with the use of the words districts, right?
[48:25.120 --> 48:27.600]  This is dystopian stuff, guys.
[48:27.600 --> 48:31.440]  The plan is that most residents will live within 30 minutes of all services, including
[48:31.440 --> 48:32.440]  their jobs.
[48:32.440 --> 48:34.400]  Well, what's so sinister about that?
[48:34.400 --> 48:38.840]  What happens when you leave your district or you leave the boundary?
[48:38.840 --> 48:43.640]  See, on that map that you're looking at now, you can see the yellow borders.
[48:43.640 --> 48:45.600]  This is what they call the district boundary.
[48:45.600 --> 48:50.840]  Now, I want to acknowledge here that, you know, this is regular language that councils
[48:50.840 --> 48:51.840]  may use.
[48:51.840 --> 48:56.840]  They talk about district boundaries or region boundaries, you know, certain government
[48:56.840 --> 49:01.520]  organizations that are allocated to looking after these districts or regions.
[49:01.520 --> 49:03.840]  You know, we won't ignore that.
[49:03.840 --> 49:08.920]  But the reality is that they talk about the fact that they don't want you leaving this
[49:08.920 --> 49:11.280]  area because it's bad for the environment.
[49:11.280 --> 49:15.400]  And if you look at that district, anyone who's familiar with the city of Sydney, you would
[49:15.400 --> 49:20.960]  notice that the edge of those yellow borders there are actually pretty much where you
[49:20.960 --> 49:21.960]  start to get.
[49:21.960 --> 49:28.680]  I mean, apart from a couple of suburbs there, you start to get more, you know, greener places.
[49:28.680 --> 49:30.360]  You get the mountains.
[49:30.360 --> 49:32.320]  You get a forest land.
[49:32.320 --> 49:33.840]  They don't want you living in there.
[49:33.840 --> 49:39.640]  See, they want to push you into these three districts where everything is connected.
[49:39.640 --> 49:45.800]  They go on to talk about collaborative leadership being an essential factor in successful innovation
[49:45.800 --> 49:51.080]  of districts around the world and the alliance.
[49:51.080 --> 49:57.640]  They make reference to the alliance will enable a unified voice and a long term perspective.
[49:57.640 --> 50:04.280]  This is the plan for the whole world to put you into these districts.
[50:04.280 --> 50:08.520]  Now what is the digital idea going to enable them to do?
[50:08.520 --> 50:10.440]  Well, what happens when you leave your district?
[50:10.440 --> 50:14.640]  What happens when you go even one meter outside of your district?
[50:14.640 --> 50:19.040]  We know that during the lockdowns here in Australia, they actually said to us that we
[50:19.040 --> 50:22.240]  can't travel more than 10 kilometers from our homes.
[50:22.240 --> 50:26.840]  Then it was five kilometers from our homes because apparently COVID knows the difference
[50:26.840 --> 50:28.720]  between five and six kilometers.
[50:28.720 --> 50:32.760]  You're not going to catch it if you travel five kilometers, you won't spread it.
[50:32.760 --> 50:35.520]  But if you travel six, then COVID will spread.
[50:35.520 --> 50:37.320]  This is the lunacy of what we went through.
[50:37.320 --> 50:42.240]  And they even went to the stage of saying that even if grocery stores are more than
[50:42.240 --> 50:46.680]  five kilometers here in Western Sydney, they said even if grocery stores are more than
[50:46.680 --> 50:49.480]  five kilometers, you can't travel to that grocery store.
[50:49.480 --> 50:54.240]  They laid a backflip on that, but that was real advice for the so-called management of
[50:54.240 --> 50:56.760]  the virus that happened during the lockdown.
[50:56.760 --> 51:02.880]  So this was a conditioning tool for telling you what you can and can't eat, what you can
[51:02.880 --> 51:06.360]  and can't, where you can and can't go.
[51:06.360 --> 51:12.480]  Five minutes ago, they were selling you the great Aussie dream and the great American
[51:12.480 --> 51:17.120]  dream of owning your own home and having something to pass on to your generations.
[51:17.120 --> 51:21.040]  And now all of a sudden, you'll own nothing, you'll be happy.
[51:21.040 --> 51:22.960]  It's a complete backflip.
[51:22.960 --> 51:28.800]  And the reason why is because everything that they've sold you about human success has depended
[51:28.800 --> 51:31.920]  on people trusting the system, trusting the corporations.
[51:31.920 --> 51:39.800]  Like go to uni, get a corporate job, climb the corporate ladder so that you can afford
[51:39.800 --> 51:47.200]  the great Aussie dream or the great American dream, meanwhile, they're removing land titles.
[51:47.200 --> 51:52.680]  And now the Australian government has this tactic of first homes are so unaffordable
[51:52.680 --> 51:57.560]  that the government's going to help you by giving you more of an incentive to buy, but
[51:57.560 --> 52:00.080]  they're going to own 40% of your home.
[52:00.080 --> 52:02.800]  And eventually that'll be 100 because they don't want you to own anything.
[52:02.800 --> 52:06.840]  They don't want you to have any type of independence.
[52:06.840 --> 52:12.360]  So back to these districts, they even had a map at the time of the lockdowns where you
[52:12.360 --> 52:19.560]  could punch in your address and it would show you a circle of exactly how far you're allowed
[52:19.560 --> 52:27.240]  to travel based on whatever nonsense science told you that you can't leave your district.
[52:27.240 --> 52:33.400]  So when they implement these digital IDs and again mandatory for company directors here
[52:33.400 --> 52:38.400]  in Australia already as of November, this year you cannot own a company unless you have
[52:38.400 --> 52:39.400]  a digital ID.
[52:39.400 --> 52:42.080]  So as Alex always says, it's a corporate takeover.
[52:42.080 --> 52:43.080]  Why does he say that?
[52:43.080 --> 52:45.400]  Well, because they start with the corporations first.
[52:45.400 --> 52:49.880]  People are more interested in their pocket than living independently and trying to find
[52:49.880 --> 52:52.200]  a way to live outside of the system.
[52:52.200 --> 52:54.600]  And the reality is that we're resourceful individuals.
[52:54.600 --> 52:56.960]  We don't need their system.
[52:56.960 --> 53:01.280]  We can build our own system, but not enough people want to do it and it's just easier
[53:01.280 --> 53:03.120]  to be plugged into their matrix.
[53:03.120 --> 53:12.000]  But the digital ID will be locked to your social security number, your Medicare, your
[53:12.000 --> 53:21.880]  healthcare, they'll be sharing your info with private corporations and you'll have no privacy.
[53:21.880 --> 53:26.240]  No one knows who these private corporations are or if we know who they are, we don't know
[53:26.240 --> 53:29.880]  what agenda is behind that.
[53:29.880 --> 53:34.920]  Your tax file number, your car registration, your credit card, everything will be linked
[53:34.920 --> 53:36.000]  to this digital ID.
[53:36.000 --> 53:39.560]  So what happens when you leave your district?
[53:39.560 --> 53:43.680]  When you leave that little border, what happens if you want to go to the mountains one day
[53:43.680 --> 53:45.400]  outside of your district?
[53:45.400 --> 53:46.400]  What?
[53:46.400 --> 53:51.680]  All of a sudden your social credit score is impacted, your tax file number so you can't
[53:51.680 --> 53:53.560]  work?
[53:53.560 --> 53:54.560]  Your healthcare?
[53:54.560 --> 54:01.640]  What if you're a diabetic and you go and you eat a doughnut?
[54:01.640 --> 54:05.840]  What all of a sudden your private health insurance is cancelled?
[54:05.840 --> 54:07.840]  You're not able to access medical services.
[54:07.840 --> 54:11.560]  The digital ID is so dangerous.
[54:11.560 --> 54:16.600]  And they've used COVID and their whole, oh, well, the tracking and tracing that we did
[54:16.600 --> 54:21.600]  during COVID, look how well the Melbourne experiment went, look how well the other countries went.
[54:21.600 --> 54:28.280]  This human living lab has enabled us to look after the climate and we've, you know, you
[54:28.280 --> 54:30.480]  can see how this all links.
[54:30.480 --> 54:34.480]  So they've used that as an excuse to roll out this global digital ID, but all that it
[54:34.480 --> 54:38.240]  spells is complete digital enslavement.
[54:38.240 --> 54:43.440]  You won't be able to make one move without the government watching everything that you
[54:43.440 --> 54:44.440]  do.
[54:44.440 --> 54:49.560]  And it'll all, I mean, who's to say, they backflip on this stuff all the time.
[54:49.560 --> 54:53.760]  Five minutes ago, we were in threat of an ice age.
[54:53.760 --> 54:55.960]  Now we're at threat of global warming.
[54:55.960 --> 55:00.320]  So the science can change at any given time.
[55:00.320 --> 55:04.960]  The science around climate change, the science around your health can change at any given
[55:04.960 --> 55:05.960]  time.
[55:05.960 --> 55:13.200]  And they can, you know, the control that they will have through the digital IDs is limitless.
[55:13.200 --> 55:16.560]  Because at any given moment, they could just simply say, well, the science has changed
[55:16.560 --> 55:17.560]  now.
[55:17.560 --> 55:19.920]  We've already seen them doing that.
[55:19.920 --> 55:23.120]  I saw a recent statement from the German health minister.
[55:23.120 --> 55:25.440]  It was the most ridiculous thing.
[55:25.440 --> 55:29.520]  He was saying that, oh, well, the unvaccinated are a risk.
[55:29.520 --> 55:33.560]  This is their excuse for pushing, continuing to push the injections on the unvaccinated
[55:33.560 --> 55:37.640]  who if you're not injected by now, you're probably never getting injected, right?
[55:37.640 --> 55:44.440]  They saying the unvaccinated are more of a risk because when you're vaccinated, you're
[55:44.440 --> 55:50.920]  more likely to get the virus quicker, develop symptoms quicker and go and get tested.
[55:50.920 --> 55:56.160]  Whereas if you're unvaccinated, you're likely to develop symptoms a lot slower.
[55:56.160 --> 55:59.760]  That makes no sense whatsoever.
[55:59.760 --> 56:04.600]  And none of what they do make sense.
[56:04.600 --> 56:13.200]  You've got the International Energy Agency demanding, excuse me, worldwide lockdowns.
[56:13.200 --> 56:30.200]  Forgive me, guys, worldwide lockdowns to meet climate goals.
[56:30.200 --> 56:33.800]  This is how they're going to do it.
[56:33.800 --> 56:40.920]  Through their new religion of climate change, and in this IEA, International Energy Agency,
[56:40.920 --> 56:45.080]  10-point plan to cut oil use.
[56:45.080 --> 56:53.560]  They want to reduce the speed limits, okay, fine, excuse me.
[56:53.560 --> 56:57.400]  Reduce speed limits, okay, that's fine, make public transport cheaper, fine.
[56:57.400 --> 57:00.440]  Car-free Sundays in large cities.
[57:00.440 --> 57:02.840]  They don't want you driving a vehicle.
[57:02.840 --> 57:06.640]  And if you do drive a vehicle, they want it to be electric so that you can't leave your
[57:06.640 --> 57:11.040]  district and if you do, they just switch it off.
[57:11.040 --> 57:15.200]  Look how easy it will be when everything is linked.
[57:15.200 --> 57:19.520]  As part of the plan, they want more people working from home up to three days a week
[57:19.520 --> 57:20.520]  where possible.
[57:20.520 --> 57:28.240]  Again, going into that working from home cell where, you know, it's a good thing.
[57:28.240 --> 57:30.160]  You get more freedom working from home.
[57:30.160 --> 57:33.840]  You have more time, your expenses are less.
[57:33.840 --> 57:39.120]  Meanwhile, all of your social interaction is completely gone.
[57:39.120 --> 57:45.160]  We'll wrap up this information in the next segment and then we'll start taking some calls.
[57:45.160 --> 57:51.080]  If people have questions about Australia, I'll see you soon.
[57:51.080 --> 57:55.360]  Sold out for more than a year and a half because of supply chain breakdowns.

[59:55.560 --> 1:00:01.840]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:00:01.840 --> 1:00:09.360]  We are now inside the operational phase of global, cultural and economic societal collapse.
[1:00:09.360 --> 1:00:23.080]  Senate reports, DHS reports, journalistic reports confirming millions and millions and
[1:00:23.080 --> 1:00:30.320]  millions of people walking right across mainly the Texas border now and massive human smuggling
[1:00:30.320 --> 1:00:38.560]  run by the Biden administration through NGOs, non-governmental organizations with on camera
[1:00:38.560 --> 1:00:42.960]  thousands of children at bus stops and airports a day.
[1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:48.720]  Children as young as six months old with no paperwork not with their parents being given
[1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:51.000]  to other people with no paperwork.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:56.400]  I read a story yesterday of a 10-year-old girl who was processed through our own government
[1:00:56.400 --> 1:01:02.920]  delivered to a family and then put in a house raped, abused and cut in supposedly the greatest
[1:01:02.920 --> 1:01:03.920]  country in the world.
[1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:09.280]  And we have stash houses with 73 people in it, 13 kids in our nation's capital.
[1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:11.200]  I'm tired of this crap.
[1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:16.200]  Actual child kidnapping and trafficking on an industrial scale.
[1:01:16.200 --> 1:01:19.280]  I spent more than a week in Central America recently.
[1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:23.640]  I had the opportunity actually to interview a human trafficker.
[1:01:23.640 --> 1:01:28.280]  Is it easier to traffic the children and get them in than the adults?
[1:01:28.280 --> 1:01:29.280]  Okay.
[1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:34.280]  It's more risky because once we get to the cartels, they are asking for children for
[1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:36.600]  them to traffic with drugs.
[1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:41.880]  In the case of children, it really scares him to just see the reality that they can
[1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:43.600]  go through.
[1:01:43.600 --> 1:01:49.360]  And for him, it's pretty horrific to see how they are murdered in many cases.
[1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:55.800]  What about people that want to buy a child because they are a sexual predator?
[1:01:55.800 --> 1:02:01.880]  I've heard that some people in places have very specific things that they like, certain
[1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:05.200]  nationalities or certain age groups.
[1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:10.560]  So the cartels are looking for the people going around and when they spot someone with
[1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:14.640]  those characteristics, they tend to like take them.
[1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:17.000]  In most cases, they wanted to sell their organs.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.240]  So that is the reason they take children.
[1:02:19.240 --> 1:02:21.240]  That's very hard to hear.
[1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:23.600]  Yes, it's very hard.
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:27.920]  Sometimes they take out the organs and they refill the body with drugs so they can take
[1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:28.920]  it through the border.
[1:02:28.920 --> 1:02:34.440]  Do they sell them to hospitals or to buyers, like private buyers, wealthy buyers?
[1:02:34.440 --> 1:02:35.440]  It's so personal.
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:40.960]  They are people with money that want to buy the organs of kids and it's not only for
[1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:41.960]  a country.
[1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:48.120]  They take it to different countries and normally they do this with clinics that are not authorized.
[1:02:48.120 --> 1:02:49.120]  Absolute next level.
[1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:53.400]  We know the globalists are obsessed with child trafficking, obsessed with pedophilia,
[1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:55.880]  obsessed with sexualization of children.
[1:02:55.880 --> 1:03:00.560]  An anonymous whistleblower has come forward sitting down with Xavier Hernandez, who works
[1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:07.120]  as a travel youth care worker for a federally funded contractor and shares the tens of thousands
[1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:09.320]  of unaccompanied migrant children.
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:15.040]  So two to five thousand a week are being bust and flown throughout the United States and
[1:03:15.040 --> 1:03:18.400]  handed off to quote unvetted adult sponsors.
[1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:24.240]  The employee and she actually gives us the name MVM Inc. said the company's main focus
[1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:29.480]  is getting unaccompanied minors from quote point A shelters to point B sponsors across
[1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:30.840]  the United States.
[1:03:30.840 --> 1:03:38.360]  You need to understand that we are looking at an operation of not only human trafficking,
[1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:41.200]  but in this case, child trafficking.
[1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:45.480]  For those of us in the audience who might not know what MVM Inc. is, can you explain
[1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:48.360]  to us what your company is and what they do?
[1:03:48.360 --> 1:03:56.560]  It's a company that focuses on getting, they call it UCs, unaccompanied children, unaccompanied
[1:03:56.560 --> 1:04:02.680]  minors, getting them from point A to point B, and most of the time point A is from a
[1:04:02.680 --> 1:04:12.280]  shelter, all two of Texas and all across the country, and point B is with a sponsor.
[1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:17.680]  Most of the time it's a family member, but maybe the numbers are so crazy that it's no
[1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:24.680]  longer family members, it's family friends, people who are willing to take them in, and
[1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:28.160]  a lot of the times they don't even know each other.
[1:04:28.160 --> 1:04:32.840]  So if you could give us an estimate how many children per month you think are being moved
[1:04:32.840 --> 1:04:35.360]  just in the Texas area?
[1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:42.800]  Like I said, it's between all the offices, it's in the thousands, I say 80 to 10, but
[1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:48.880]  that's in one week, so in a month I would say around 40,000, 30,000 kids.
[1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:54.920]  30 to 40,000 children a month being given away to Perfect Strangers with no record.
[1:04:54.920 --> 1:04:59.600]  This is Jeffrey Epstein Island on Warp Speed.
[1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:04.960]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S. that supplies the
[1:05:04.960 --> 1:05:10.200]  highest quality signature reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon, and other U.S. government
[1:05:10.200 --> 1:05:11.200]  agencies.
[1:05:11.200 --> 1:05:17.320]  And now they have produced specifically for us this Made in America onion line at a very
[1:05:17.320 --> 1:05:22.280]  affordable price, whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone, or big pouches
[1:05:22.280 --> 1:05:27.720]  that protect laptops and iPads, or big bags that promote whatever electronics you want
[1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:33.840]  to put in it, like desktop computers, it is all exclusively available at infowarstore.com
[1:05:33.840 --> 1:05:36.760]  under the Redux name.
[1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:41.440]  This is info wars, taking the highest quality products and bringing them directly to you
[1:05:41.440 --> 1:05:42.440]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:48.400]  In this insane world, you are crazy if you don't protect your signature, your identity
[1:05:48.400 --> 1:05:52.880]  from identity theft, hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.
[1:05:52.880 --> 1:06:03.920]  This is one of the hottest items out there today that's exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[1:06:03.920 --> 1:06:09.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show this Sunday, I'm your host Maria Z from Zmedia.com, we're
[1:06:09.760 --> 1:06:16.240]  talking about smart cities, the plan for complete and total world enslavement by pushing people
[1:06:16.240 --> 1:06:21.280]  out of urban areas into these smart cities where everything that you do think say will
[1:06:21.280 --> 1:06:22.760]  be tracked and traced.
[1:06:22.760 --> 1:06:26.920]  We've been going into these straight in plans, but there is one more plan that I want to
[1:06:26.920 --> 1:06:27.920]  highlight here.
[1:06:27.920 --> 1:06:32.360]  It's the Bathurst plan to transform into a smart city by 2025.
[1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:38.920]  George A. Dyer do a fantastic analysis just the other day on their plans and the decades
[1:06:38.920 --> 1:06:43.120]  that 2030, 2040 and 2050.
[1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:48.760]  This is really by 2025, they want to do this to the city of Bathurst in New South Wales.
[1:06:48.760 --> 1:06:55.560]  Basically, this entire plan includes things like app linked to shopping to prevent you
[1:06:55.560 --> 1:06:59.480]  from purchasing food that you do not need.
[1:06:59.480 --> 1:07:04.960]  They plan on watching everything that you purchase and telling you what you do and don't
[1:07:04.960 --> 1:07:05.960]  need.
[1:07:05.960 --> 1:07:10.520]  You think you're going to have the choice of saying, oh, yeah, no, maybe I don't need
[1:07:10.520 --> 1:07:11.520]  that today.
[1:07:11.520 --> 1:07:14.440]  No, no, no, the government's going to tell you what you do and don't need.
[1:07:14.440 --> 1:07:17.560]  I mean, this is just unbelievable control.
[1:07:17.560 --> 1:07:25.200]  We're already seeing them destroying the food supply everywhere, wheat plants, bread factories,
[1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:32.000]  and processing farms all on fire all of a sudden by coincidence, I don't know, maybe
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:34.480]  we can blame climate change for that.
[1:07:34.480 --> 1:07:40.400]  They're already destroying the food supply and this on top of that will control what
[1:07:40.400 --> 1:07:41.960]  you are and are not able to purchase.
[1:07:41.960 --> 1:07:47.160]  And of course, as we discussed before, should you go and make a purchase that is outside
[1:07:47.160 --> 1:07:50.560]  of what you do and don't need, that will impact your social credit score.
[1:07:50.560 --> 1:07:56.800]  But beyond that, according to this, it will probably stop you from even making the purchase.
[1:07:56.800 --> 1:08:05.120]  So totally dictating to you, people who want to see you malnourished and poisoned dictating
[1:08:05.120 --> 1:08:08.280]  to you what you can and can't buy, that's what this means.
[1:08:08.280 --> 1:08:14.280]  It goes on to say apps that can monitor and notify energy use, thereby adjusting the use
[1:08:14.280 --> 1:08:17.320]  and it also talks about limiting water usage to households.
[1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:24.440]  So, you know, we've got Germany telling their people to wash themselves with a wet cloth
[1:08:24.440 --> 1:08:31.760]  rather than having showers that they want to completely dehumanize people, make them
[1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:38.080]  completely lose any sense of pride in their humanity, any sense of patriotism.
[1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:45.360]  This is what I spoke about this just last night, this is what allowing so many migrants
[1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:52.880]  into the country is about, I'm not against, you know, a multi-ethnic society, I'm not
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:53.880]  against that.
[1:08:53.880 --> 1:09:00.480]  But what I am against is their plan to destroy patriotism through demoralizing the society,
[1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:05.240]  because if they can do that, then people, if people lose the sense of identity and pride
[1:09:05.240 --> 1:09:09.240]  in their country, they're less likely to fight for it, they're less likely to fight for the
[1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:15.040]  freedom of Australia if Australia is no longer free, if Australia is no longer Australia,
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:20.440]  if the United States is no longer the United States, they want to destroy your national
[1:09:20.440 --> 1:09:25.720]  identity, they want to destroy any love that you have for your country.
[1:09:25.720 --> 1:09:32.020]  And this is why they've put these leaders in place that make you hate the government
[1:09:32.020 --> 1:09:37.260]  and make you look at them and say, what is this incompetent clown show that we're watching?
[1:09:37.260 --> 1:09:42.320]  Because they want you to hate your country, they want you to lose that sense of pride,
[1:09:42.320 --> 1:09:45.040]  because then you won't stand up for it.
[1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:50.760]  And we must never, ever lose that sense of patriotism and allow for these plans.
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:57.720]  They go on to talk about the final thing I want to highlight in this Bathurst plan.
[1:09:57.720 --> 1:10:05.920]  They talk about drone technology for compliance monitoring, drone technology for compliance
[1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:06.920]  monitoring.
[1:10:06.920 --> 1:10:11.000]  Now granted, within this document, they say that, you know, this is relevant to the construction
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.520]  industry, but they have to start somewhere, right?
[1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:18.360]  And they have to disguise their plans for monitoring you somewhere.
[1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:23.160]  I keep talking about the fact that all these people have said, oh, you know, I got vaccinated
[1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:24.760]  so I can go and travel.
[1:10:24.760 --> 1:10:30.560]  And yet they're destroying the travel industry, limiting flights because of CO2 and, you know,
[1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:35.800]  the climate and staff shortages, because everyone's off sick, because their immune systems are
[1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:39.320]  destroyed, whoever's remaining.
[1:10:39.320 --> 1:10:44.160]  But they're actually destroying the travel industry because they want clearer airways
[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:49.440]  to make room for more drones, to make room for more surveillance.
[1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:57.200]  It's going to be a big brother, police, state, constant, monitored city.
[1:10:57.200 --> 1:10:59.480]  No one wants this.
[1:10:59.480 --> 1:11:00.480]  Nobody wants this.
[1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:07.480]  And I want to say here, guys, how crucial supporting independent media is in these times.
[1:11:07.480 --> 1:11:11.480]  This is something you will never hear in the mainstream media.
[1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:17.960]  The mainstream media would love to sweep COVID under the rug, sweep the bio weapon death
[1:11:17.960 --> 1:11:23.920]  shots under the rug, sweep all the people that are dying from sudden adult death syndrome
[1:11:23.920 --> 1:11:30.920]  in the droves under the rug and pretend this is all normal and blame it on climate change.
[1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:35.360]  They want you to forget their crimes.
[1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:43.360]  Independent media is the part of this puzzle that is going to show you what they're doing
[1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:50.120]  next because the battle is not over, where in fact, we've only just started COVID was
[1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:58.640]  a, you know, a children's playground compared to the totalitarianism that they want to
[1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:01.320]  implement globally.
[1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:07.160]  So independent media plays the most crucial role right now because this is an information
[1:12:07.160 --> 1:12:08.160]  war.
[1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:13.960]  This is a war on your very mind, on the psychology of humanity.
[1:12:13.960 --> 1:12:15.920]  It is a psychological war.
[1:12:15.920 --> 1:12:21.320]  It is one where the propaganda, and this is why I played the Clara clip earlier, the team
[1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:27.560]  played it for us because you watch the way that they present these things and the language
[1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:28.560]  that they use.
[1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:30.720]  These people understand the power of words.
[1:12:30.720 --> 1:12:35.800]  This is why they keep changing the definition of words because they know that words have
[1:12:35.800 --> 1:12:36.800]  power.
[1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:41.520]  So when they tell you that something is good, it's actually evil.
[1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:46.480]  When they tell you that something is a liveable city, it actually means that it's going to
[1:12:46.480 --> 1:12:49.160]  be very hard for you to live there.
[1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:55.960]  When they tell you that something is good for the planet, the double speak there is that
[1:12:55.960 --> 1:12:59.840]  it's good for them to have access to all the greenery in the world.
[1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:05.200]  And while you're confined to your district that has borders that don't allow you to go
[1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:10.880]  to the green parts of the earth because that's reserved for the self-proclaimed elites, everything
[1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:14.040]  that they do is double speak.
[1:13:14.040 --> 1:13:15.200]  And they've already got plans.
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:21.400]  We saw that leak from Trudeau installing weapons armories, interrogation rooms for his ministry
[1:13:21.400 --> 1:13:22.400]  of climate change.
[1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:27.760]  A similar thing happened in France where they launched their climate change police force
[1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:34.120]  where the French Interior Minister, Gerald Dumman, was hiring 3,000 green police officers
[1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:40.160]  to go after those who violate green-related criminal issues to safeguard the country from
[1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:43.680]  disasters that are supposedly caused by humans.
[1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:48.880]  You see, you were the enemy during COVID.
[1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:51.680]  The unvaccinated were the enemy.
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:52.960]  Human beings were the enemy.
[1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:57.800]  They were the carriers of the deadly virus that was going to take out humanity.
[1:13:57.800 --> 1:14:01.160]  And the same tactic will be used with climate change.
[1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:02.880]  You are the enemy.
[1:14:02.880 --> 1:14:04.760]  You breathing is the enemy.
[1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:09.080]  You having a farm and living independently is the enemy because your cows are emitting
[1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:10.800]  gases.
[1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:14.600]  You having birds, chickens is the enemy.
[1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:19.120]  You know, here in Queensland, in the state of Queensland in Australia, you need a license
[1:14:19.120 --> 1:14:22.880]  technically to share your eggs with people.
[1:14:22.880 --> 1:14:29.000]  There was recently a legislation, the agriculture bill that was passed in Victoria, that prevents
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:34.280]  people from sharing meat that they've obtained through hunting.
[1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:37.480]  You can't share your meat.
[1:14:37.480 --> 1:14:40.640]  You are the enemy of the planet.
[1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:44.320]  Well, why can't you share your meat?
[1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:47.400]  Why can't you go and have your own chickens?
[1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:51.560]  Why can't you go and have your own land?
[1:14:51.560 --> 1:14:56.720]  Because they paint you and human beings as the disease.
[1:14:56.720 --> 1:15:00.880]  They paint you as the problem of the earth and they are coming with their solution with
[1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:02.680]  their one world government.
[1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:09.960]  And of course, the more they demoralise society, the more that they make you feel that you
[1:15:09.960 --> 1:15:13.280]  are nothing, the more you'll stop fighting.
[1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:17.080]  This is exactly why we have to keep fighting.
[1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:19.240]  In the next segment, we're going to take some calls.
[1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:25.640]  We've got the number here and I'm opening the lines for people to ask questions specifically
[1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:30.320]  about Australia, any of the things that you've seen here and how that may relate to your
[1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:32.200]  country and what they're going to do next.
[1:15:32.200 --> 1:15:43.160]  The number to call is 877-789-2539 or 877-789-ALEX and I look forward to speaking with you guys
[1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:44.160]  soon.
[1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:46.880]  Again, we're going to talk about the plans that they've implemented here, any questions
[1:15:46.880 --> 1:15:52.280]  that you guys have about Australia specifically or anything that we've spoken about today
[1:15:52.280 --> 1:15:59.000]  and we can get into your calls right after this break.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:05.440]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:09.280]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:12.760]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:14.440]  You might not agree with everything.
[1:16:14.440 --> 1:16:18.840]  You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information and there's
[1:16:18.840 --> 1:16:20.800]  nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:22.080]  Thank you for that Ward.
[1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:26.400]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, Infowarsstore.com is where to
[1:16:26.400 --> 1:16:29.360]  get them folks and we do have the best supplements.
[1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:35.800]  Just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, we do the best with our
[1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:38.080]  supplements as well.
[1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:41.680]  Look at the hair and beard support formula, folks, this is a joke.

[1:16:44.360 --> 1:16:46.920]  By the way, it works for me in case you haven't noticed.
[1:16:46.920 --> 1:16:50.960]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.
[1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:53.000]  Quite well, I might add.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:58.920]  I go and see him quite often now.
[1:16:58.920 --> 1:17:05.920]  The number one selling category in supplements worldwide is fat burners, is weight loss formulas.
[1:17:05.920 --> 1:17:10.960]  And listen, there are hundreds of them out there that work, but most of them do it in
[1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:12.840]  a toxic way.
[1:17:12.840 --> 1:17:17.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did deep research on the safest, healthiest ways

[1:20:47.360 --> 1:20:54.240]  our water supply and info wars has been at the forefront of protecting people and their
[1:20:54.240 --> 1:20:55.800]  health.

[1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:26.680]  media in whatever way you can so that they can keep bringing this important information
[1:21:26.680 --> 1:21:27.680]  out to you.
[1:21:27.680 --> 1:21:33.640]  Today we are going to take some callers now, we've got, I've opened up the phone lines,
[1:21:33.640 --> 1:21:41.800]  the team has done so on 877-789-2539 or Alex and we're talking about Australia, taking
[1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:45.920]  questions about Australia but we've got Travis in Connecticut right now calling about the
[1:21:45.920 --> 1:21:48.320]  J&J vaccine, Travis you're on the air.
[1:21:48.320 --> 1:21:56.040]  Hey Maria, thanks for your call, I had a question about the Johnson vaccine, if you knew if
[1:21:56.040 --> 1:22:02.800]  it was less harmful compared to the other vaccines because it's supposedly not mRNA,
[1:22:02.800 --> 1:22:05.400]  can you tell me more about that?
[1:22:05.400 --> 1:22:11.440]  Yeah Travis, what I know is that it was pulled off the market in multiple locations, every
[1:22:11.440 --> 1:22:16.080]  single one of these vaccines, so for example Novavax, they spoke about the fact that that's
[1:22:16.080 --> 1:22:23.000]  a different technology, it's not harmful but they were using moths and there were multiple
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:28.200]  studies done on the fact that it is actually just as harmful but it's in a different way,
[1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:36.200]  I've actually got multiple videos on the safety of Novavax and I would caution anyone to be
[1:22:36.200 --> 1:22:41.440]  just as cautious of J&J as they are of every single big pharma company because the plan
[1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:48.440]  here is a continuous cycle of injections to harm you lifelong, they want you to have
[1:22:48.440 --> 1:22:53.480]  a lifetime subscription to these injections and what will happen is as your immune system
[1:22:53.480 --> 1:22:59.600]  continues being destroyed by these, you'll need more pharmaceutical products to survive
[1:22:59.600 --> 1:23:04.200]  and this is actually from the patents themselves that they want you to have a lifetime subscription
[1:23:04.200 --> 1:23:07.200]  to injections, in fact all the stuff that we were talking about today where it comes
[1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:14.680]  to linking the digital ID, monitoring everything that you do is intricately linked with these
[1:23:14.680 --> 1:23:20.720]  injections, in fact they make it possible to monitor you and like I said it's a lifetime
[1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:25.720]  subscription Travis so if possible stay away from all of it, they cannot be trusted.
[1:23:25.720 --> 1:23:29.240]  Yeah, that makes full sense, thank you.
[1:23:29.240 --> 1:23:33.880]  You're welcome Travis, we'll go to Red in Colorado who's talking about Chemtrails, Red
[1:23:33.880 --> 1:23:34.880]  you're on the ad.
[1:23:34.880 --> 1:23:40.360]  There's still both Scout, Red, US Pentagon first team and I'm Red and we're wondering
[1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:45.760]  in Australia, is everything dying like the insect population, you're not even going
[1:23:45.760 --> 1:23:52.800]  to have bugsy, chemically-nucleated ISIS forming in times at 40 degrees and they're
[1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:58.800]  getting snowballed, galleys and droughts and they're not 500 years, it's never happened
[1:23:58.800 --> 1:24:06.600]  like this, a hot side to a cold weather front down in Sydney, I guess winter's there, winter
[1:24:06.600 --> 1:24:11.320]  season, I don't know what's going on but up here, it's the worst droughts ever, they're
[1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:16.600]  drying up, you won't be able to cool the nuclear power plants, the methane breaking through
[1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:23.440]  the both poles and undersea, the algae dying, the whole planet dying, I don't think it's
[1:24:23.440 --> 1:24:25.560]  going to make it to 2030.
[1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:33.200]  We got to stop those KC-135, KC-12 from dumping aluminum and that graphene, it's killing you
[1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:38.320]  from the sky and I know, I've talked to strangers, they've taken two and three shots, they don't
[1:24:38.320 --> 1:24:44.600]  even look sick, this is possibly a percentage dying, I don't see anyone dying from that,
[1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:49.520]  the red versus the blue and both sides are getting frayed on and they're getting hit
[1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:50.520]  with all of them.
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:56.280]  What you're talking about there is really multi-layered, they're poisoning us through
[1:24:56.280 --> 1:25:01.360]  the skies, yes, Australia's skies are being sprayed constantly, in fact, whenever we have
[1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:07.040]  what they're calling rain bombs, you can clearly see a pattern in the skies a day or two or
[1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:12.880]  a few days before we have this so-called rain bombs and they are poisoning us through the
[1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:16.400]  skies because if they don't get you through the injections, if they don't get you through
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:20.040]  the food supply, they'll get you through the air, what choice do you have?
[1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:25.080]  You have to still breathe, so they are and it's constant here in Australia and again,
[1:25:25.080 --> 1:25:29.400]  as I was saying, it's happening a lot along the East Coast, which is where they're planning
[1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:35.600]  these smart cities, so weather warfare is a huge part of the New World Overglobal Takeover,
[1:25:35.600 --> 1:25:41.360]  they are engaging in weather warfare and testing it in Australia as they do with everything
[1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:51.920]  else, but what you're seeing here and the destruction of the East Coast is what you'll
[1:25:51.920 --> 1:25:56.400]  see everywhere if they succeed and this is why it is so important, as you said, Red,
[1:25:56.400 --> 1:26:01.160]  to keep educating people because people need to understand what's happening here, it is
[1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:07.280]  a complete war on every aspect of your life and you're right, we may not have enough insects
[1:26:07.280 --> 1:26:12.440]  left because all of a sudden, bees are in trouble here in Australia, we need the bees,
[1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:13.440]  what's killing them?
[1:26:13.440 --> 1:26:16.760]  Well, it's probably everything that they're spraying in the skies, so you're absolutely
[1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:19.280]  right, Red, we need to put a stop to this.
[1:26:19.280 --> 1:26:24.560]  We'll do it, we'll do it, get our name out, both got red, we're not Q and I, where's the
[1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:30.800]  real thing, it's top Pentagon, ground the tankers, that's our call, vulturesquadron.com,
[1:26:30.800 --> 1:26:37.200]  geoengineeringwatch.org, get going on this, I don't know how much we could save, it's
[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:43.360]  the patients that, what they call stage four critical, that's where it is now, we're the
[1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:49.280]  doctors, we read the x-rays and it's stage four plus, I don't know how much we're gonna
[1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:55.520]  have to operate but we gotta move fast because I don't figure 2030 is even attainable the
[1:26:55.520 --> 1:27:01.280]  way it's going, 30 back in 2018, she was a hero, she said, hey, you only got 12 years
[1:27:01.280 --> 1:27:06.840]  left, she didn't know how right she was but she wasn't gonna stop it and she went into
[1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:07.840]  combat.
[1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:11.920]  Well, you're not wrong, Red, you're not wrong that we are the doctors of today, that we
[1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:17.640]  are the scientists of today, I can't even begin to explain how much I've had to learn
[1:27:17.640 --> 1:27:26.400]  about law and science and the body and health and vaccines, I feel like I could recite most
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:30.520]  of what people like Dr. McCullough say because we've just absorbed that much knowledge over
[1:27:30.520 --> 1:27:36.960]  the past couple of years that's really helped us because it's so crucial to arm yourself
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:40.320]  with knowledge and this is why people like you, Red and everyone that's tuning in to
[1:27:40.320 --> 1:27:45.200]  this broadcast today and other days is so important, it's so crucial to be armed with
[1:27:45.200 --> 1:27:50.920]  that knowledge because again, you can't fight against something unless you know what you're
[1:27:50.920 --> 1:27:56.880]  fighting against and that's the whole point here so thank you so much, Red, for sharing
[1:27:56.880 --> 1:28:01.440]  this information, please do keep sharing this broadcast, keep educating those around you
[1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:06.560]  and stay strong, Red.
[1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:12.800]  One thing that I'm so encouraged by is when I get to speak to people and hear how awake
[1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:18.400]  they are and hear just how much they've realised that the government can't be trusted, it's
[1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:23.360]  really interesting, I interviewed Pastor Poloski from Canada recently and he said to me, you
[1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:29.560]  know, I come from communism, I saw this a mile away, I knew exactly what this was and
[1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:34.960]  for all of those who didn't grow up in communism or have family that grew up in communism,
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:39.280]  they're starting to learn exactly what communism looks like right now.
[1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:43.360]  We'll be back right after this short break, we'll take some more calls from people, we've
[1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:46.760]  got quite a few calls coming through, we're going to power through them, I really want
[1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:52.160]  to take your questions about Australia and connect with the viewers so we'll see you
[1:28:52.160 --> 1:28:59.680]  right after this short break.
[1:28:59.680 --> 1:29:05.600]  Seven months ago in December of 2021, we launched the first three-coin founding member series
[1:29:05.600 --> 1:29:11.000]  George Washington slaying the dragon, then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin and finally
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:17.800]  the Second Amendment comment-ticket Molan Labe coin, there are only 75 coins left in
[1:29:17.800 --> 1:29:27.000]  the three-point series exclusively right now at 1776point.com and for the final 75 people
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:30.880]  to become founding members for this big project we're launching in the near future, you'll
[1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:36.400]  also get a personal signed piece of art I made of the sheepdog chasing the wolf in a

[1:29:59.400 --> 1:30:04.760]  So many people over the years have walked up to me randomly on the street and said super

[1:30:10.560 --> 1:30:16.240]  protects from Chinese medicine and other ancient traditions, known herbal compounds that boost
[1:30:16.240 --> 1:30:23.000]  libido, stamina and energy and it comes from cold pressed herbs so they're not boiling
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:29.480]  or heating up the herbs that are known to have these natural effects, it's cold pressed,

[1:30:58.680 --> 1:31:03.280]  People say Alex Jones crazy, he's a conspiracy theory guy, he's a nutcase, he's got these
[1:31:03.280 --> 1:31:10.360]  rants and all that, what they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many
[1:31:10.360 --> 1:31:17.000]  different topics of signal not noise, if you look at the signal and you compare that to
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:23.320]  PBS and NPR and BBC and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective
[1:31:23.320 --> 1:31:27.680]  body has put out there and if you're a sent in a human being and just watching it you say
[1:31:27.680 --> 1:31:31.240]  well got Alex Jones is ahead of this, not only that he kind of explained it, you are
[1:31:31.240 --> 1:31:35.920]  one of the great thinkers of this, that is very rare, you've got to go back almost to
[1:31:35.920 --> 1:31:40.840]  the revolutionary generation and see that, in this new book I've got to tell you when

[1:33:27.480 --> 1:33:36.920]  the end.
[1:33:36.920 --> 1:33:41.040]  If you just go by what they did with the uh like you said before with the lab
[1:33:41.040 --> 1:33:45.880]  racks, the first phase was putting the graphene outside inside them. The second
[1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:49.280]  phase is going to be the neural link. It's going to be put a microchip in
[1:33:49.280 --> 1:33:53.400]  everyone's head because it's going to be under the guise to save you because in
[1:33:53.400 --> 1:33:56.840]  order to stop this stuff and keep assembling and growing inside your body
[1:33:56.840 --> 1:34:00.960]  it's pretty much going to be the only option. It's to put a neural link in your
[1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:05.000]  head and run it current through you to control the graph. Well to try to control
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:09.800]  it because in the lab studies with the rats, first they introduce the
[1:34:09.800 --> 1:34:14.120]  graphene outside inside them which is highly toxic, leaks in all the organs
[1:34:14.120 --> 1:34:19.920]  will kill you eventually just in the toxicity. But by putting a transmitter
[1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:24.920]  inside them, a neural link or a microchip and running the current through, they
[1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:29.480]  were able to control their thoughts, their emotions and even direct them
[1:34:29.480 --> 1:34:32.960]  through a mix. So they're really going to- You're absolutely right Matt. You're right.
[1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:38.000]  And I want to comment here because they say everything that they do, they
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:42.280]  present you as a solution or something positive but it's actually linking back
[1:34:42.280 --> 1:34:48.320]  to their complete plan for control like you said. It'll be something
[1:34:48.320 --> 1:34:52.000]  that- I mean they've spoken about the fact that people who are paralyzed for
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:56.840]  example will be able to have more movement through this neural link and
[1:34:56.840 --> 1:34:59.880]  it'll really help people and it's presented as positive technology but
[1:34:59.880 --> 1:35:06.960]  it's all got an evil undertone. That is correct yeah the ultimate thing is you
[1:35:06.960 --> 1:35:11.680]  know just is to experiment on us and complete control, complete domination.
[1:35:11.680 --> 1:35:17.840]  And one more quick thing Marie, with viruses right just to prove
[1:35:17.840 --> 1:35:21.560]  like that viruses really don't exist and it's just us getting you know just
[1:35:21.560 --> 1:35:26.920]  shedding toxins. If viruses really did exist the way that these evil bastard
[1:35:26.920 --> 1:35:31.040]  states said that they did, they wouldn't have to use all this propaganda to
[1:35:31.040 --> 1:35:35.640]  present the idea of a virus. They would just release it in small areas and wipe
[1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:40.800]  you out. So the whole virus thing is horse crap in my opinion because why
[1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:45.480]  would they need such propaganda to scare you into the virus, to scare you
[1:35:45.480 --> 1:35:49.400]  into these poisonous treatments. We have such a golden opportunity right now and
[1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:53.640]  I love everyone. I pray for your people and I've tried many times watching videos
[1:35:53.640 --> 1:35:58.720]  of the horrible things, atrocities, the crimes against humanity in Australia.
[1:35:58.720 --> 1:36:03.000]  Horrible. But we have a golden opportunity right now but the veil is
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:08.600]  being removed and viruses do not exist. They make up viruses. Viruses are
[1:36:08.600 --> 1:36:12.640]  exactly what they say. They're freaking poor. I think you're right Matt. I think
[1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:15.800]  you're right Matt in the regard that a lot of effort is going right now to
[1:36:15.800 --> 1:36:20.800]  expose that everything that we knew about viruses isn't the case Dr. Mike
[1:36:20.800 --> 1:36:24.960]  Yeadon has come out recently and said respiratory viruses as we know them
[1:36:24.960 --> 1:36:28.280]  don't exist. So there's a lot of effort going into exposing this right now. We
[1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:31.720]  really appreciate your prayers here in Australia Matt. Thank you. God bless you.
[1:36:31.720 --> 1:36:36.880]  We'll go to Ventura in California and if we do miss any callers Owen Shroyer
[1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:41.040]  will be taking over after this broadcast for Sunday Night Live so he will
[1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:48.000]  continue taking some live calls. But Ventura are you with us? Hello. I have a
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  question. Do they have drag queen story times in classes and forced children to
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:58.320]  take these inoculations in Australia? They definitely are pushing the kids to
[1:36:58.320 --> 1:37:02.280]  take the injections although not by force here in Australia but the drag
[1:37:02.280 --> 1:37:05.480]  queen story time it's it's it's been slow on the uptake. Australia is a bit more
[1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:10.120]  conservative in that regard. We do have an upcoming bestiality talk at an
[1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:15.760]  Australian festival which you know Sydney Festival is ignited uproar where
[1:37:15.760 --> 1:37:20.360]  they're talking about exploring the ethics of bestiality describing you know
[1:37:20.360 --> 1:37:25.160]  engaging with animals as one of society's last taboos you know we saw the
[1:37:25.160 --> 1:37:29.320]  recent protests in Germany advocating for being able to have sex with your pets
[1:37:29.320 --> 1:37:32.800]  sorry to be disgusting but this is what these people are doing they look trying
[1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:36.280]  it is disgusting they're trying to demoralize society and do all of that
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:41.600]  so that sort of stuff is seeping into our country but thankfully no no mandated
[1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:46.240]  injections for the children here but we watch the United States closely Ventura
[1:37:46.240 --> 1:37:50.760]  and we just can't believe that you know Philadelphia I'm asking your kids
[1:37:50.760 --> 1:37:55.320]  indefinitely it's unbelievable. I mean they're just they're indoctrinating the
[1:37:55.320 --> 1:37:58.680]  children and it's gross what we're seeing here especially in America I mean
[1:37:58.680 --> 1:38:03.800]  America is where the big spot is and it's just it's horrible here I live in
[1:38:03.800 --> 1:38:08.280]  California you can barely even afford to pay your rent nowadays folks I mean it is
[1:38:08.280 --> 1:38:12.120]  ridiculous on what's what's happening today but I want you to get to other
[1:38:12.120 --> 1:38:15.480]  calls but I have a question if it's possible that I can talk to the crew
[1:38:15.480 --> 1:38:18.600]  about getting a banned video account or something because I've been I'm a
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:22.280]  conservative talk show host and I've been banned off everything every social
[1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:27.280]  media. Sure well I'm sure the crew can chat to you after this call Ventura we
[1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:32.840]  appreciate your time Kyle sorry Rachel in Missouri let's talk to Rachel Rachel
[1:38:32.840 --> 1:38:37.920]  you're on the air. Hi Maria it's so nice to see you here on Sunday because I saw
[1:38:37.920 --> 1:38:42.760]  you last week with Alex and I'm so glad to see that you're you're hosting today
[1:38:42.760 --> 1:38:48.320]  so really great to see you and the question I wanted to go ahead and ask
[1:38:48.320 --> 1:38:54.240]  you is today I just saw an article here concerning energy emergencies declared
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:39:00.640]  after a BP refinery fire in Indiana so we have the US Department of
[1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:05.280]  Transportation declared a regional emergency for Illinois, Indiana, Michigan,
[1:39:05.280 --> 1:39:12.080]  and Wisconsin after a fire shut down the BP oil refinery and some city in
[1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:20.040]  Indiana and I was wondering in Australia when things were coming down when you
[1:39:20.040 --> 1:39:25.760]  saw that there was enormous overreach did these types of events take place there
[1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:31.880]  as well? Yes absolutely but a part of the supply and chain reason they're
[1:39:31.880 --> 1:39:38.440]  actually using China's zero COVID policy to blame for our supply chain problems
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:42.560]  right now because we can't get stuff in from China and of course we outsourced
[1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:47.440]  all of our manufacturing to other countries or from other countries you
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:51.040]  know some time ago we barely do any of our own manufacturing here anymore we
[1:39:51.040 --> 1:39:55.080]  depend heavily on China and of course that's being that's being used as the
[1:39:55.080 --> 1:40:01.160]  excuse for supply chain shortages we've also got a destruction of we saw over a
[1:40:01.160 --> 1:40:04.960]  ton of avocados disposed they're telling us that eggs are going to be in
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:09.680]  shortage chicken poultry you know they're threatening us with foot and mouth
[1:40:09.680 --> 1:40:15.960]  mouth disease this is of course in order to to vaccinate the cows with mRNA
[1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:19.320]  vaccines even though we've got a stockpile of the traditional vaccines
[1:40:19.320 --> 1:40:25.360]  that we use for foot and mouth in the UK so you know what it is Rachel it really
[1:40:25.360 --> 1:40:32.560]  is the same goal in every country but different tactics being deployed to
[1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:36.880]  reach that goal so that's what we're saying but prayers are with you and your
[1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:41.240]  people and thank you so much for calling in today we've got Grant in oh no sorry
[1:40:41.240 --> 1:40:46.600]  Kyle in New York Kyle you're on the air hey how's it going how are you today
[1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:51.640]  doing well Kyle how are you I'm good thanks I just wanted to first of all thank
[1:40:51.640 --> 1:40:57.200]  you for covering this subject because it is a very important one the world that
[1:40:57.200 --> 1:41:02.240]  we know it has ended and that was in 2020 and I think that that's fair for
[1:41:02.240 --> 1:41:06.760]  everybody to acknowledge now with that said they've preconditioned everybody
[1:41:06.760 --> 1:41:13.320]  through entertainment they're using it in movies there's a movie called songbird
[1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:18.160]  and I recommend you specifically if you haven't seen the trailer go watch the
[1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:25.240]  trailer everything from the Peloton bike to double masking to the drones that you
[1:41:25.240 --> 1:41:30.240]  talk about it's all in that trailer quarantine camps facilities it's all
[1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:34.600]  there I don't know if you've seen it have you have you heard of this I haven't
[1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:38.000]  yeah so I would recommend you know when you're when you're done with the
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:41.440]  broadcast check that out because they really talk about it there now there
[1:41:41.440 --> 1:41:44.560]  was an interesting thing as far as like these smart cities that you were talking
[1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:48.920]  about Greg Reese had a report where he says that this is self-assembling
[1:41:48.920 --> 1:41:54.160]  nanotech and what happens from what I've read also is that the more this
[1:41:54.160 --> 1:42:00.320]  assembles in your body the higher the I don't know if it's big the the the hurts

[1:47:26.920 --> 1:47:31.960]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show this Sunday we're taking live calls I just
[1:47:31.960 --> 1:47:35.160]  want to comment on what Kyle the last caller was saying he's absolutely
[1:47:35.160 --> 1:47:39.120]  correct you know this whole the whole success of this system depends on us
[1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:43.920]  being plugged in the nanotech plays a huge part in that and of course you know
[1:47:43.920 --> 1:47:47.360]  that the frequencies that they'll be emitting will be intricately linked with
[1:47:47.360 --> 1:47:51.240]  the nanotech that's now inside of people we have so much evidence I had a group
[1:47:51.240 --> 1:47:55.280]  of Australian whistleblower scientists that approached me that interviews up on
[1:47:55.280 --> 1:48:00.520]  Zmedia.com ZEE media.com you can watch that and I mean there's so much
[1:48:00.520 --> 1:48:04.040]  evidence across the world from scientists German scientists are talking
[1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:08.880]  about it and and and it's it's basically undeniable now that they have done this
[1:48:08.880 --> 1:48:11.800]  to people there's no other way that people would have accepted being tracked
[1:48:11.800 --> 1:48:16.560]  and traced in this manner or essentially microchipped without the threat of a
[1:48:16.560 --> 1:48:21.360]  public health scare so so they'll continue to use these tactics we've got
[1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:26.240]  Grant in Australia calling in I thought I might get a fellow Aussie on Grant you're
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:33.480]  on the air. Hi Maria thanks for taking my call. You're welcome. I thought I better
[1:48:33.480 --> 1:48:39.200]  I thought I better stump up and you know part of you know turning up half the
[1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:46.920]  battle so winners never quit and quitters never win so what I've rung in
[1:48:46.920 --> 1:48:50.320]  about you're talking about the East Coast infrastructure so I'll try to make
[1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:55.680]  this quick rainbow flat on the Mid-North Coast received the first
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:49:02.880]  NBN connection in the NBN rollout and there's residents at Rainbow Flat who
[1:49:02.880 --> 1:49:08.760]  the rail system that you've discussed is coming through Rainbow Flat and it's a
[1:49:08.760 --> 1:49:15.680]  tiny little sleep little place or rural houses yeah so that's that's the first
[1:49:15.680 --> 1:49:20.240]  thing I wanted to let you know about but that was the first NBN connection
[1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:26.040]  I've got an IT mate who knows about these things so and then there's signs on the
[1:49:26.040 --> 1:49:30.160]  Mid-North Coast about water continuity they've been doing a lot of
[1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:35.760]  infrastructure to make sure there's water and I'm like I've noticed them a few
[1:49:35.760 --> 1:49:39.680]  years back and I'm like this is going to be not many people they've got these
[1:49:39.680 --> 1:49:44.720]  signs everywhere for this water and they built a dam on the Mid-North Coast and
[1:49:44.720 --> 1:49:49.520]  they somehow conveniently forgot to install the critical pipes for this
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:56.320]  dam so they've built a dam and you know it can't be used so that's right
[1:49:56.320 --> 1:49:59.760]  Grant everything that there's everything that they're setting up and and I
[1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:03.120]  commend you for looking further into these things people really need to
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:05.720]  everything that they're setting up including the legislation that was
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:10.560]  passed right under our noses while we were being terrorized by our insane
[1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:15.400]  psychopathic government is is setting up the infrastructure for these smart
[1:50:15.400 --> 1:50:19.080]  cities for what they want to do again referencing the Jay Dyer presentation
[1:50:19.080 --> 1:50:22.520]  from the other day whoever hasn't seen it I encourage that you watch it because
[1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:26.360]  by 2050 we're talking about complete global enslavement thanks so much for
[1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:32.400]  calling in Grant so early on a Monday morning we'll go to Andy in Maine talking
[1:50:32.400 --> 1:50:37.960]  about do Australians know what's going on in the US Andy? Yeah hey Marie good
[1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:45.280]  day so I have a I have a ton of friends in Australia I speak to on a daily basis
[1:50:45.280 --> 1:50:50.000]  and they think I'm crazy when I tell them about what's going on in the States
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:56.240]  they literally have no idea I mean whatever the issue is whether it's
[1:50:56.240 --> 1:51:03.960]  abortion or vaccines or any of it gun control they have zero idea and it
[1:51:03.960 --> 1:51:08.760]  seems like they can't even get the information about it I'm trying to
[1:51:08.760 --> 1:51:13.080]  inform them as best possible but is there any way other than word of mouth
[1:51:13.080 --> 1:51:17.160]  to get word out to what's going on and give them a warning because it's coming
[1:51:17.160 --> 1:51:21.520]  your way like some of this insanity that I the drag Queen story time thing that
[1:51:21.520 --> 1:51:27.480]  was brought up before like they literally are like that is insane that is
[1:51:27.480 --> 1:51:33.360]  crazy they don't believe it and even with even with Howard Springs I had them
[1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:36.920]  look that up and I think it's a government website that talks about
[1:51:36.920 --> 1:51:42.120]  Howard Springs and they make it sound like it's a resort they literally do the
[1:51:42.120 --> 1:51:45.560]  quarantine camp they make sound like it's a resort and it's some place that you
[1:51:45.560 --> 1:51:50.840]  would choose to go to even if you were vaccinated it's just insane what you're
[1:51:50.840 --> 1:51:55.080]  not hearing about Ricardo Bosie is another one you know and Australia one
[1:51:55.080 --> 1:52:00.880]  they don't even know what Australia one is yeah Andy Andy you sound like a
[1:52:00.880 --> 1:52:05.640]  really switched on guy so Howard Springs for anyone who's listening is the the
[1:52:05.640 --> 1:52:09.600]  model that was used as the quarantine you know the ultimate
[1:52:09.600 --> 1:52:14.120]  quarantine facility for all of Australia I've actually got an article up on my
[1:52:14.120 --> 1:52:18.400]  website it's called Australia Australia under threat by their own government
[1:52:18.400 --> 1:52:21.600]  something along those lines which actually details all of the quarantine
[1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:25.040]  facilities that we're aware of right now with further quarantine facilities that
[1:52:25.040 --> 1:52:30.080]  are planned and so some of these quarantine facilities have been built on
[1:52:30.080 --> 1:52:34.240]  places where they used to dump military waste it's hardly a place that you want
[1:52:34.240 --> 1:52:38.960]  to put people to you know to be healthy it's not really healthy to go somewhere
[1:52:38.960 --> 1:52:43.840]  where they would dump waste but we had an example of Haley Hodgson who was
[1:52:43.840 --> 1:52:49.560]  taken to a quarantine facility because she didn't comply with home quarantine
[1:52:49.560 --> 1:52:54.520]  requirements it was used as a form of punishment we also had the military come
[1:52:54.520 --> 1:52:59.080]  and take people who were simply close contacts they weren't positive from an
[1:52:59.080 --> 1:53:03.600]  Aboriginal community in the in the Northern Territory the military came
[1:53:03.600 --> 1:53:07.240]  and escorted them and so you know the propaganda that came out at the time was
[1:53:07.240 --> 1:53:10.480]  all you know the government are that they understand the government's looking
[1:53:10.480 --> 1:53:14.320]  after them and this is for their health meanwhile two of them actually escaped
[1:53:14.320 --> 1:53:17.160]  the facility so tell me how they know it's for their health if they're trying
[1:53:17.160 --> 1:53:21.360]  to escape now it's absolutely not a holiday resort this is going to be used
[1:53:21.360 --> 1:53:26.920]  for dissent we see again Trudeau's you know internment camp for climate
[1:53:26.920 --> 1:53:31.120]  deniers this is these quarantine facilities will be repurposed there's a
[1:53:31.120 --> 1:53:34.480]  lot of information in that article that I've written so I encourage anyone who
[1:53:34.480 --> 1:53:38.160]  wants to know more about Australia's quarantine facilities to go on to zmedia.com
[1:53:38.160 --> 1:53:41.960]  and check out the article section for that thanks so much Andy for your call
[1:53:41.960 --> 1:53:48.400]  we'll go to Laurie in Pennsylvania talking about Pfizer vaccine shedding any
[1:53:48.400 --> 1:53:55.160]  tips for dealing with that Laurie yes hi back in 623 of 21 I gave my two
[1:53:55.160 --> 1:53:58.960]  neighbors a ride they were both fully vaccinated with the Pfizer shots one and
[1:53:58.960 --> 1:54:02.360]  two the very next day I've been have you know I had a massive headache the
[1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:08.000]  bleeding out the night set sweats the diarrhea for six months I had my back
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:11.600]  felt like it was on fire like someone was holding a blow torch to it for the
[1:54:11.600 --> 1:54:15.880]  whole six months that went away now here it is it's like a little bit over 14
[1:54:15.880 --> 1:54:19.840]  months I'm still having massive chronic headaches on the top of my head and the
[1:54:19.840 --> 1:54:24.560]  back of my head and my period is still never the same I get to sometimes in a
[1:54:24.560 --> 1:54:30.440]  month I do get those jelly lake plots that we all see and I was wondering what
[1:54:30.440 --> 1:54:35.400]  exactly did I inhale from the Pfizer shots and I've been trying everything I
[1:54:35.400 --> 1:54:40.160]  tried every Mekton I tried everything I even the Spanish researchers how they
[1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:43.560]  get the graphene oxide I did all those supplements I am a little bit less
[1:54:43.560 --> 1:54:48.640]  magnetic than what I was you know about a year ago I'm less magnetic but I'm
[1:54:48.640 --> 1:54:53.080]  still a little bit magnetic but not as bad is I mean this shedding is really
[1:54:53.080 --> 1:54:56.320]  real and it's it's really serious and there's a lot of people out there
[1:54:56.320 --> 1:55:01.040]  suffering like me and I was wondering I know you know a lot about this stuff and
[1:55:01.040 --> 1:55:04.960]  if you can help me anymore is this ever going to go away as you can eventually
[1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:11.040]  kill me or what well Laurie I'm first and foremost I'm so sorry to hear about
[1:55:11.040 --> 1:55:14.240]  this and I know that you're not alone because so many people across the world
[1:55:14.240 --> 1:55:18.360]  are talking about a similar thing you know we went to such an effort to stay
[1:55:18.360 --> 1:55:22.400]  away from these injections and yet just simply being exposed to people who've
[1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:26.680]  been injected has resulted in some side effects for people so that's
[1:55:26.680 --> 1:55:30.440]  absolutely devastating to hear that that's happening to you in terms of the
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:33.600]  research that's happening I've spoken to a lot of different doctors that are
[1:55:33.600 --> 1:55:36.840]  looking into this I know that there is more research happening the World
[1:55:36.840 --> 1:55:42.720]  Council for Health has published a free spike protein detox on their website
[1:55:42.720 --> 1:55:46.640]  I've posted it in my telegram before that's just Z media you can go in and
[1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:50.320]  search for World Council for Health detox if you can't find it on their website
[1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:54.960]  again it's a free detox guide I can't guarantee that this is going to help but
[1:55:54.960 --> 1:55:58.960]  a lot of people have reported that after doing that detox that it they do feel
[1:55:58.960 --> 1:56:02.760]  better you know you've said already that you've you've taken some supplements
[1:56:02.760 --> 1:56:07.760]  and that they have helped somewhat the more that you can do to detox yourself
[1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:11.560]  right now the better but in the meantime Laurie I'm just just take comfort in the
[1:56:11.560 --> 1:56:16.000]  fact that there are there is definitely more research going towards this the FL
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:22.760]  triple C has also published a vaccine injury guide so it whilst you haven't
[1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:27.760]  had the injection yourself that injury guide you know that protocol that
[1:56:27.760 --> 1:56:33.040]  treatment by Dr. Pierre Corian and a few others may actually be helpful to you and
[1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:36.040]  so anyone who's listening who's experiencing those symptoms please do
[1:56:36.040 --> 1:56:39.120]  go and look at those resources again that's the World Council for Health
[1:56:39.120 --> 1:56:45.840]  spike protein detox guide and the FL triple C website as well for the protocol
[1:56:45.840 --> 1:56:49.400]  I'm just aware that we've got about a minute left of today we do have more
[1:56:49.400 --> 1:56:55.760]  callers in the queue Owen Troyer will be taking over after for Sunday Night Live
[1:56:55.760 --> 1:57:02.920]  so he will continue taking live calls but you know I really feel for people I
[1:57:02.920 --> 1:57:10.200]  really do because people went to such an effort to avoid being poisoned by these
[1:57:10.200 --> 1:57:14.760]  deadly shots they knew what they were and yet people are still experiencing this
[1:57:14.760 --> 1:57:20.560]  and it is it is such a criminal thing it is such a criminal thing the people are
[1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:25.960]  suffering as a result of this when when they lost so much to stay away from these
[1:57:25.960 --> 1:57:31.200]  deadly harmful injections and so my heart goes out to humanity but again this is
[1:57:31.200 --> 1:57:37.160]  why independent media is so crucial this is why you need to keep supporting this
[1:57:37.160 --> 1:57:42.960]  broadcast and others so thank you so much to everyone for tuning in today
