[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]  [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   According to Pfizer's very limited human trials, 87% of pregnant mothers lost their babies after receiving the shot.
[00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:24.003]  And for those who survived the deadly shot and are able to reproduce, their offspring's DNA is now forever mutated.
[00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:29.745]  There is now irrefutable proof that the mRNA vaccines are a deadly toxin.
[00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:38.548]  Aside from the relentless debilitating spike protein that's keeping everyone who has been jabbed sick, the vaccines contain metals.
[00:00:39.148 --> 00:00:43.509]  Metals that have been observed to self-assemble outside of the body.
[00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.011]  And most disturbingly, metals that assemble inside of the body.
[00:00:48.551 --> 00:00:55.773]  Studies show that these metals are found in the blood of 94% of those who have received a COVID vaccine.
[00:00:56.654 --> 00:01:02.415]  And these mysterious conglomerates of metal make their final appearance in the dead.
[00:01:02.935 --> 00:01:11.018]  All over the world, coroners are now finding that the arteries of the vaccinated have been clogged with mysterious growths.
[00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:18.183]  Non-organic masses made up of conductive metals such as aluminum, sodium, and tin.
[00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:23.346]  This is what's most likely causing all the organ failure and heart attacks.
[00:01:24.047 --> 00:01:26.008]  Heart attacks in our children.
[00:01:26.288 --> 00:01:34.211]   Two days ago, I've I flew out my first 10-year-old with a heart attack, and I had to fight the doctor in the ER because he's like, 10-year-olds don't have heart attacks.
[00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:49.494]  And I argued back and forth for 30 minutes to force his hand to get an EKG to find out that he had almost a complete STEMI, which is ST-elevated myocardial infarction, for which you could see it lit up on the 12-lead EKG.
[00:01:49.514 --> 00:01:51.355]  And he's like, well, that's not possible.
[00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:53.595]  And I'm like, well, he was just vaccinated yesterday.
[00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:55.136]  It is very much possible.
[00:01:56.036 --> 00:02:02.099]  At any given time, people are getting a hold of me and the nurse advocates at American Frontline Nurses to help advocate.
[00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:04.481]  Because as you've seen, there's victim shaming.
[00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:07.102]  That, oh, it's anxiety.
[00:02:07.242 --> 00:02:08.103]  Oh, it's this.
[00:02:08.623 --> 00:02:18.962]   But in actuality, if they put down that it was a vaccine injury, The physician, the corporation, the hospital, the clinic, they actually won't get reimbursed, so it gets labeled as anxiety.
[00:02:19.542 --> 00:02:26.047]  According to the whistleblowers, the doctors are lying about the vaccine deaths to make a few thousand bucks.
[00:02:26.608 --> 00:02:29.290]  Is that why Trump has been pushing the deadly shots?
[00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.453]  Killing our own children for a measly million dollars?
[00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:44.797]  Now that the truth about the deadly COVID vaccines is finally starting to break free, the mainstream media is shifting their narrative and blaming it all on President Trump.
[00:02:45.218 --> 00:02:53.261]  And they've already laid the groundwork back in 2016, when the herd was told to believe that Trump is literally Hitler.
[00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:56.122]  We should look at Adolf Hitler in 1929.
[00:02:56.522 --> 00:03:00.423]  He was a kind of a funny kind of character that said the things that people were thinking.
[00:03:01.383 --> 00:03:04.584]  Where Donald Trump takes it, I have absolutely no idea.
[00:03:05.044 --> 00:03:08.625]  But Donald Trump is a dangerous man with the things that he has been saying.
[00:03:08.725 --> 00:03:12.366]  You might argue that Trump is innocent, but he doesn't.
[00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:16.207]  He brags of all the lives he has saved.
[00:03:16.727 --> 00:03:19.868]  And the herd will believe what they are told to believe.
[00:03:20.228 --> 00:03:25.350]  It shows you how unpainful that vaccine shot is, so everybody go get your shot.
[00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:29.452]  It works incredibly well, 95%, maybe even more than that.
[00:03:29.492 --> 00:03:30.813]  It works incredibly well.
[00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:35.475]  It's a great vaccine, it's a safe vaccine, and it's something that works.
[00:03:35.695 --> 00:03:38.376]  I recommend you take it, but I also believe in your freedoms 100%.
[00:03:39.436 --> 00:03:47.058]  When you have the vaccine, people that do, and it's a very small number, relatively, but people that do get it get better much quicker.
[00:03:47.358 --> 00:03:48.759]  That's a very important thing to know.
[00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.280]  They don't get nearly as sick and they get it, they get better.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.600]  Lindsey Graham's an example.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.841]  He said, if I didn't have this vaccine, I would have died.
[00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:56.722]  And you know what?
[00:03:56.822 --> 00:03:58.363]  I believe totally in your freedoms.
[00:03:58.443 --> 00:03:59.104]  I do.
[00:03:59.124 --> 00:04:00.225]  You gotta do what you have to do.
[00:04:00.325 --> 00:04:00.606]  But!
[00:04:01.467 --> 00:04:03.268]  I recommend take the vaccines!
[00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:04.349]  I did it, it's good.
[00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.310]  Take the vaccines.
[00:04:05.391 --> 00:04:07.713]  But... You got... No, that's okay.
[00:04:07.753 --> 00:04:08.514]  That's alright.
[00:04:09.294 --> 00:04:10.255]  You got your freedoms.
[00:04:11.468 --> 00:04:13.368]  But I happen to take the vaccine.
[00:04:13.388 --> 00:04:15.429]  The vaccines do work and they are effective.
[00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:22.871]  I am, I think I saved many, I don't think, I know I saved millions and millions of lives throughout the world.
[00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:24.731]  We could have had another Spanish flu.
[00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:29.613]  We could have had, you know, in 1917, close to 100 million people died, they say.
[00:04:30.153 --> 00:04:31.113]  But it was really bad.
[00:04:31.913 --> 00:04:37.716]  And now other countries are using our vaccines and, you know, they're tremendously successful.
[00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:41.397]  You're playing right into their hands when you're sort of like, oh, the vaccine.
[00:04:41.838 --> 00:04:44.219]  If you don't want to take it, you shouldn't be forced to take it.
[00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:45.339]  No mandates.
[00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.041]  But take credit, because we saved tens of millions of lives.
[00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:50.601]  Take credit.
[00:04:50.882 --> 00:04:52.682]  Don't let them take that away from you.
[00:04:52.942 --> 00:04:55.283]  Okay, so the president made news... Do you agree with that?
[00:04:55.103 --> 00:04:56.103]  You with that?
[00:04:56.103 --> 00:04:57.103]  Great.
[00:04:57.103 --> 00:05:07.103]   Good afternoon and welcome to the Alex Jones Show in New York.
[00:05:07.041 --> 00:05:13.762]  It is Sunday the 28th of August and Alex has graciously asked me to host today's broadcast.
[00:05:13.862 --> 00:05:16.523]  I'm Maria Zee from ZeeMedia.com.
[00:05:16.543 --> 00:05:23.325]  A couple of weeks ago I was on the Alex Jones Show talking about the testing ground of Australia.
[00:05:23.785 --> 00:05:33.328]   We are the beta test for the New World Order and that is evidence through everything that we went through But I've also got evidence for you today of what they call the Melbourne Experiment.
[00:05:33.348 --> 00:05:46.315]  We're going to be breaking down the Smart City Agenda, how Australia is being used as the model for the world, the blueprint that they're using for everyone else, including the districts where they've got district borders.
[00:05:46.895 --> 00:05:55.840]  We'll get into the organisations responsible for this, some of the legislation that has already been passed to put this into action.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:08.364]  And then we'll go through some of the news that's travelling at the moment, along with some analysis on how this all relates to the global takeover that we are all being subjected to right now.
[00:06:08.424 --> 00:06:10.505]  In hour two, we're going to take some calls.
[00:06:10.905 --> 00:06:15.227]  We're going to open up the phone lines and we will provide the number for that a little bit later.
[00:06:15.307 --> 00:06:30.154]   But I guess what I really want people to understand is the key that made Australia the successful testing ground Of their plans was the compliance of our nation.
[00:06:30.174 --> 00:06:36.081]  See, we've never really had to fight against our government and I'm not calling for civil unrest here.
[00:06:36.121 --> 00:06:39.525]  I'm talking about really stand up against tyranny in our country.
[00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:47.254]  We've had it easy here in Australia and because of that, it's just given them an easy ride to take over.
[00:06:48.328 --> 00:06:51.350]  Our will to take over our entire country.
[00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:57.754]  And this is why it is so crucial for people to continue to stand against this.
[00:06:57.814 --> 00:07:05.218]  You saw the unbelievable footage coming out of Australia over the past two years of people being tackled to the streets.
[00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:07.220]  We had pregnant women being tackled.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.601]  We had police shooting at protesters.
[00:07:10.081 --> 00:07:13.203]  It was absolutely unbelievable what we faced.
[00:07:13.644 --> 00:07:20.948]   And so what a lot of people might not be aware of is the fact that We've actually got documents called the Melbourne Experiment.
[00:07:20.988 --> 00:07:29.352]  If you recall, Melbourne endured some of the worst lockdowns, if not the worst, in the whole world during that time.
[00:07:29.412 --> 00:07:35.114]  In fact, six lockdowns, more than 260 days in total.
[00:07:35.715 --> 00:07:37.396]  And they've used this as a model.
[00:07:37.436 --> 00:07:44.399]  They've literally, within this document, they speak about how this was a living lab for the whole world.
[00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:46.500]  They've done surveys.
[00:07:47.463 --> 00:07:51.545]  To assess human response to these lockdowns.
[00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:54.926]  And this is also referenced in this document.
[00:07:54.966 --> 00:08:02.649]  So, you know, when you when you analyze this entire thing, we're not going to go through the whole thing today, but there's some key language that I want people to understand.
[00:08:02.989 --> 00:08:06.751]  But when you analyze this, it's like they they wanted an outcome.
[00:08:07.574 --> 00:08:10.076]  From this analysis.
[00:08:10.636 --> 00:08:13.478]  It's literally reverse engineering the desired outcome.
[00:08:13.498 --> 00:08:19.002]  It's produced by the Monash University, one of Australia's most prestigious universities.
[00:08:19.042 --> 00:08:28.028]  It just so happens to be the university that's partnering up with Moderna to produce 100 million doses of mRNA injections per year.
[00:08:29.136 --> 00:08:31.457]  Why would we need 100 million doses per year?
[00:08:31.837 --> 00:08:38.140]  Well, you know, the same reason that we have Vaxxers in Queensland producing 300 million doses a year.
[00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:46.244]  What does Australia, a population of around about 26 million people, need 400 million doses of injections per year?
[00:08:46.284 --> 00:09:22.590]   Well, it's because this is going to be an ongoing cycle of injections and what they've done with this Melbourne experiment, six lockdowns over 260 days, Is lab test the Australian people, like lab rats, to see how far they could push them and unfortunately in Australia they were quite successful again because we have our she'll be right attitude and I want people all over the world to never have that attitude again because you saw what they were able to achieve here in Australia.
[00:09:23.766 --> 00:09:29.349]  In this particular analysis, there's a section called Environmental Impacts.
[00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:37.494]  They talk about encouraging behaviours that were found to reduce heat levels and air pollution during COVID-19.
[00:09:37.834 --> 00:09:44.138]  And this could of course include working from home, fewer private vehicles on the roads, so on and so forth.
[00:09:44.198 --> 00:09:50.302]   And throughout this document, it's littered with climate change agenda Language.
[00:09:50.342 --> 00:09:57.267]  And if you recall during the lockdowns, they didn't even wait one moment to start promoting climate lockdowns.
[00:09:57.307 --> 00:10:05.912]  We saw images, side-by-side images of different cities with smog in one picture and clear skies in the other.
[00:10:05.932 --> 00:10:09.053]  And we know that these images were doctored.
[00:10:09.073 --> 00:10:26.746]   You know, later on it was found out through various People on social media who spend the time to investigate these things, these pictures were actually doctored and it wasn't really the case that all the smog was lifting, but they were prepping you.
[00:10:27.206 --> 00:10:39.956]  The whole world for climate lockdowns already in the middle of lockdowns, in the middle of all of humanity having their jobs impacted, their livelihood, the ability to feed their families.
[00:10:40.868 --> 00:10:44.271]  Every single thing that they did was a conditioning tool.
[00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:53.618]  They go on to talk about building back better, of course, the favourite slogan of these psychopaths, and the green recovery.
[00:10:54.078 --> 00:10:59.882]  Of course, the green recovery because of human-induced climate change, they say.
[00:10:59.942 --> 00:11:05.607]  We know that the whole CO2 narrative, there's so much coming out now that that is all a farce.
[00:11:06.047 --> 00:11:07.087]  It's unbelievable.
[00:11:07.747 --> 00:11:11.048]  You know, they're talking about Mother Earth.
[00:11:11.128 --> 00:11:14.389]  We even heard Pelosi recently talking about the mother.
[00:11:14.849 --> 00:11:34.413]  This is literally their new religion, just the same way that they used the vaccines to talk about how they're going to save, you know, you know, they pull all of humanity into this, into this, this task of saving the world.
[00:11:35.529 --> 00:11:47.031]  How much more effective is this Saving Mother Earth campaign going to be when they say that, you know, it's not just COVID now, it's not just saving the existing people on the planet.
[00:11:47.831 --> 00:11:49.912]  We've got to save the future generations.
[00:11:50.332 --> 00:11:56.833]  We've got to save the planet for all of the people that are coming, you know, over the next hundred years.
[00:11:56.873 --> 00:12:05.660]   And how selfish are you if you go outside and breathe This is literally what they're saying to you.
[00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:27.258]   They go on and they've actually had a look here within this document at suburban temperature data the days of the week during lockdown periods and they're saying that, you know, the team have also been working with the Victorian Environmental Protection Authority Contributing to a global study of 80 to 100 cities.
[00:12:27.599 --> 00:12:31.602]  So this isn't just Melbourne in Australia that they're doing this in.
[00:12:31.622 --> 00:12:36.466]  I guarantee you, they have tested the whole world.
[00:12:36.626 --> 00:12:40.709]  It may even be your city that they've done a similar study in.
[00:12:40.749 --> 00:12:50.237]  But the problem is that because this is such a multi-layered attack, people don't generally have the time to go and read an entire 80-page report.
[00:12:50.257 --> 00:12:52.519]  This one's not 80 pages, but many of them are.
[00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:56.794]  Even over that, to go and dissect all of these documents.
[00:12:56.814 --> 00:13:01.778]  And again, I say, most of the time, there is a desired outcome.
[00:13:01.818 --> 00:13:06.902]  Of course, the new desired outcome is their new cult religion of climate change.
[00:13:07.863 --> 00:13:27.478]   And everything that they do within these studies, within these documents, is geared towards that desired outcome of creating the problem, And giving you the solution, which of course always results in more and more of your civil liberties being eroded.
[00:13:28.699 --> 00:13:35.822]  You know, they talk about humans contributing to urban warmth through anthropogenic emissions.
[00:13:37.042 --> 00:13:40.284]  This is talking about breathing.
[00:13:40.404 --> 00:13:45.386]  They're saying that your breath contributes to global warming.
[00:13:47.282 --> 00:13:49.863]  What are they going to do to stop you from breathing?
[00:13:50.924 --> 00:13:59.887]  Well, the whole plan is to lock you in your city, your little smart city, and limit you to 30 minutes of travel.
[00:14:00.888 --> 00:14:05.250]  That is what everything that I'll be going through today proves.
[00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.391]  And it's not just Australian studies that are showing this.
[00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:12.072]  This is in line with what the United Nations is planning.
[00:14:12.112 --> 00:14:14.173]  They praise the Melbourne experiment.
[00:14:14.513 --> 00:14:21.751]   They praise You know, Australia's response to COVID-19, like we somehow handled it.
[00:14:21.791 --> 00:14:26.893]  How many times did we hear in the media that Australia responded so well and we've managed the pandemic?
[00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:42.419]  Meanwhile, because we're such a highly injected population, our hospitalizations are through the roof, our injected deaths are through the roof, and this is happening globally because of this clot shot.
[00:14:43.328 --> 00:14:51.044]  We'll be back right after the break to break down more of these smart cities locking you into your home.
[00:14:51.084 --> 00:14:54.044]  No more than 30 minutes travel right after the break.
[00:14:54.044 --> 00:15:02.044]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:02.044 --> 00:15:05.484]  I'm your host today, Maria Zee from Zee Media.com.
[00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:11.951]  It is Sunday the 28th of August and Alex has graciously asked me to host this Sunday's broadcast.
[00:15:11.971 --> 00:15:27.957]  Today we're talking about why the statement that Australia is the testing ground of the New World Order is absolutely irrefutable and why it's important for you to know and understand the tactics that they used in our country to make sure that they don't do the same thing to you.
[00:15:28.037 --> 00:15:35.500]   I truly believe that in order to If you want to fight something or stand against something, you have to know what you're standing against.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:52.106]  So we're talking about the Melbourne Experiment, a document produced by Monash University, and the fact that they are saying that humans contribute to urban warmth through anthropogenic emissions, essentially telling you that you are not allowed to breathe.
[00:15:53.627 --> 00:16:01.233]  The air pollution levels for Melbourne and regionally from satellite observations were drastically reduced during lockdown.
[00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:12.203]  So all of the benefits of lockdowns, we know that what they say are benefits of lockdowns, we know that lockdowns achieve nothing as far as the virus or so-called virus is concerned.
[00:16:12.723 --> 00:16:27.768]   But really for their plans, these lockdowns are something that they have planned ongoing because Their new religion of climate change and Mother Earth is going to be something that they so viciously protect.
[00:16:28.368 --> 00:16:43.135]  So they used Australia and Melbourne in particular, again, over 260 days in lockdown as the beta test to see how long they could keep people locked in their homes, how far they could push the people for the greater good.
[00:16:43.195 --> 00:16:47.637]  And this is exactly what they're going to do next time when it comes to climate lockdowns.
[00:16:47.697 --> 00:16:49.538]  And mark my words, that will happen.
[00:16:49.918 --> 00:16:55.581]  They go on to talk about recommendation for a post COVID-19 recovery of the world.
[00:16:56.141 --> 00:17:04.707]  And they say that they want to encourage behaviours that were found to reduce heat levels and pollution during COVID-19.
[00:17:04.747 --> 00:17:09.190]  This could include working from home and fewer private vehicles on the road.
[00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.951]  So let's talk about working from home.
[00:17:10.991 --> 00:17:12.972]  Working from home is great.
[00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.414]  You know, it gives people flexibility.
[00:17:15.874 --> 00:17:18.156]  It allows them to reduce their spending.
[00:17:19.157 --> 00:17:28.878]   It also gives your employer the opportunity to Not increase your wages because they say that your costs of getting to work are less.
[00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:33.681]  It also completely, it reduces the human interaction.
[00:17:33.721 --> 00:17:37.083]  How many people were depressed during lockdowns because they were working from home?
[00:17:37.443 --> 00:17:39.785]  They couldn't handle being on Zooms all the time.
[00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:46.989]  They want to limit that human interaction as much as possible because they're conditioning you for the metaverse.
[00:17:47.050 --> 00:18:01.595]   Because life, under their complete totalitarian dystopian nightmare is going to be so unbearable that you'll be so depressed sitting in your lounge room wanting to escape reality that you plug into the metaverse.
[00:18:02.235 --> 00:18:07.199]  A fake reality where you can create some sort of a life that isn't so horrible.
[00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:11.583]  And I'm not exaggerating here because they want you depressed.
[00:18:11.623 --> 00:18:12.764]  They want you weak.
[00:18:13.399 --> 00:18:14.860]  They want you malnourished.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.241]  They plan on doing it.
[00:18:16.281 --> 00:18:20.583]  They plan on reducing your ability to eat meat and nutrients.
[00:18:21.243 --> 00:18:22.604]  Codex Alimentarius.
[00:18:22.664 --> 00:18:25.425]  Let's call poisons nutrients.
[00:18:25.445 --> 00:18:27.206]  Let's call nutrients poisons.
[00:18:27.586 --> 00:18:31.088]  Let's reclassify everything that's good for you as a poison.
[00:18:31.849 --> 00:18:33.189]  And this is exactly what they've done.
[00:18:33.229 --> 00:18:36.051]  They've been rewriting knowledge.
[00:18:37.304 --> 00:18:38.705]  They've been rewriting knowledge.
[00:18:39.205 --> 00:18:52.675]  And so everything that they do and plan in these documents, again, it's like a reverse of a study where they say, well, here's our desired outcome and we're going to tell you what you need.
[00:18:52.735 --> 00:18:55.057]  We're going to tell you what's good for you.
[00:18:55.537 --> 00:18:57.919]  You don't get to decide for yourself anymore.
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:08.414]   So it even goes on to say, this will be tested in a living lab Through real world experimentation.
[00:19:08.774 --> 00:19:16.600]  And again, I've said earlier, they've said that it is a test that's happening in collaboration with between 80 to 100 cities worldwide.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.602]  So it could be your city that you live in.
[00:19:18.882 --> 00:19:24.206]  You don't even know that they're using the language that this is a living lab test.
[00:19:25.427 --> 00:19:26.808]  They consider you a lab rat.
[00:19:29.847 --> 00:19:36.912]  I spoke to someone recently, I was out in public and a lady said to me, oh I recognise you from the internet.
[00:19:37.393 --> 00:19:43.598]  And she said, but I stopped tuning in because COVID's done now and everything's back to normal.
[00:19:43.618 --> 00:19:46.420]  And I said, you have no idea, do you?
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.341]  You have no idea.
[00:19:50.034 --> 00:19:51.255]  That you were the lab rat.
[00:19:51.635 --> 00:19:58.959]  They tested on you to see how far you could go and they are banking on you believing that things are just going back to normal.
[00:19:59.439 --> 00:20:07.223]  Little do you know that you're going to be trapped in this little smart city, confined to a 30 minute perimeter.
[00:20:08.764 --> 00:20:09.264]  Perimeter.
[00:20:09.845 --> 00:20:11.526]  And I'll show you that in a moment.
[00:20:13.207 --> 00:20:27.694]   They talk about Digital technology in this document and they say the successful contact tracing, tracking, screening and testing rely on innovative technology and have been used globally to contain and mitigate the virus.
[00:20:27.714 --> 00:20:29.834]  Well, there's been no mitigation of the virus.
[00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:32.735]  There's no containment of the virus that's actually happened.
[00:20:33.075 --> 00:20:33.875]  That's a lie.
[00:20:34.175 --> 00:20:39.036]  In fact, all of the evidence is showing us that these injections are actually self-spreading.
[00:20:40.377 --> 00:20:42.217]  They spread the spike protein.
[00:20:43.294 --> 00:20:44.014]  They spread.
[00:20:44.155 --> 00:20:55.702]  People, I've heard reports, I mean I get people all the time in my Telegram channel saying, you know, I spent time in a car with people that were recently injected and now I have all these symptoms.
[00:20:56.122 --> 00:20:59.824]  People that have treated vaccine injured people have all these symptoms.
[00:20:59.864 --> 00:21:02.266]  So there's no mitigation of the virus.
[00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:10.671]  But this is, they talk about it, successful contact tracing, tracking and screening and you already know that they're preparing us for the next pandemic.
[00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:12.772]  Bill Gates has spoken about this openly.
[00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:15.631]  We have to prepare for the next pandemic.
[00:21:15.671 --> 00:21:22.538]  This is the reason why Australia is, you know, creating this vaccine economy.
[00:21:22.558 --> 00:21:25.722]  Because we're preparing for the next pandemic.
[00:21:25.742 --> 00:21:26.362]  Hang on a second.
[00:21:26.743 --> 00:21:29.185]  Weren't we told that this was a one in 100 year event?
[00:21:31.573 --> 00:21:34.816]  Weren't we told that this is a rare event?
[00:21:34.896 --> 00:21:41.342]  Why is it that we are being conditioned now to accept the fact that pandemics are just a normal way of life?
[00:21:41.882 --> 00:21:43.724]  Viruses are a normal way of life.
[00:21:44.084 --> 00:21:45.565]  This is just the norm now.
[00:21:46.546 --> 00:22:10.468]   Well, I don't know, maybe it's got to do with all of the research happening in the bio labs where they can just, you know, program their little virus Through AI and all of the DNA testing that they've been doing, the gene collecting, the DNA collecting all across the globe, enables them to just program something to kill the next lot of people off.
[00:22:11.629 --> 00:22:13.430]  This is literally the world that we're living in.
[00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:23.418]  It sounds totally crazy, but I know that the people that tune into this broadcast are switched on, intelligent people, and I know that you all know that what I'm saying is absolutely correct.
[00:22:23.498 --> 00:22:26.100]  Alex has been warning us about this for years.
[00:22:28.066 --> 00:22:33.388]  Back to the Melbourne Experiment document, and I'll move on from this document in a minute, but this is crucial.
[00:22:33.428 --> 00:22:45.414]  This opens up a wide and novel research domain where the internet can be re-conceptualised as a human behavioural laboratory at a global scale.
[00:22:46.054 --> 00:22:56.979]  They are telling you that the internet will be re-conceptualised as a human behavioural laboratory at a global scale.
[00:22:57.751 --> 00:23:07.460]  In the next segment, I'm going to go into what the United Nations has to say about the Melbourne experiment and then talk to you about the smart cities that are already planned here in Australia.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:12.144]  I read through, I mean, I touched on this with Alex the last time I was on his show.
[00:23:12.705 --> 00:23:17.489]  We've literally got street furniture that's going to monitor human behavior.
[00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:28.433]   You've got the internet of things where every single person that's in the city Everything you do is going to be visible to the person next to you, so you'll be self-policing.
[00:23:28.453 --> 00:23:33.660]  You think censorship is bad now where we have to use silly words on social media to cover the truth?
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.723]  Wait until your neighbor is policing you.
[00:23:36.323 --> 00:23:38.006]  We'll be right back in the next segment.
[00:23:42.998 --> 00:23:47.523]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday broadcast.
[00:23:47.623 --> 00:23:50.506]  I'm your host Maria Z from zmedia.com.
[00:23:50.546 --> 00:24:01.338]  We're talking about the plan of the globalists to enslave the whole world in 30-minute smart cities based on the Melbourne experiment right here in the testing ground.
[00:24:01.738 --> 00:24:03.620]  Of the New World Order that is Australia.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.683]  So we went through a Monash University document.
[00:24:06.963 --> 00:24:14.991]  Now we're talking about the UN Chronicle, which is dated the 28th of January 2021, where they reference the Melbourne experiment.
[00:24:15.371 --> 00:24:19.955]  They've said COVID-19, sustainable development and the Melbourne experiment.
[00:24:19.995 --> 00:24:29.203]   So they are talking about within this document, you know, the Melbourne experiment to build back better, Governments need to do this, that and the other.
[00:24:29.243 --> 00:24:37.228]  I won't bore you with the details, but basically in here they've talked about a survey of COVID-19 responses to understand behavior.
[00:24:37.648 --> 00:24:38.689]  Scrub, they call it.
[00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:48.075]  And of course, all of these people went in and completed this survey, which is essentially just human data collection, which is what they've been doing this whole time.
[00:24:48.556 --> 00:24:53.699]  They call it a living lab, this Melbourne experiment, and the UN is so proud of it.
[00:24:54.306 --> 00:24:56.768]  Because this is what they want to do to everyone.
[00:24:56.808 --> 00:24:58.789]  They want to treat you all like lab rats.
[00:24:59.509 --> 00:25:05.713]  And then these people go and, you know, complete these surveys thinking they're helping the government do better next time.
[00:25:05.993 --> 00:25:10.016]  You're contributing to their data collection and the problem.
[00:25:10.376 --> 00:25:16.720]  But here's the thing, eventually we won't even need to do surveys because everything will be visible in the Internet of Things.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.341]  You'll be policed.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:25.840]   Every move that you make, every thought that you have, that's linked to their internet of things
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.200]  will be publicly available.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.519]   So you'll be self-policing, so terrified to even have an independent thought.
[00:25:31.519 --> 00:25:37.000]   And that is the reality of where these people wanna go if we don't stop them and if we don't wake people up.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.500]   I go on to talk about the Melbourne digital city model in this UN report.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:47.840]   And it says that the project is conducting a pilot in Melbourne, investigating how to plan
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.800]   and design 20 minute neighborhoods in the post COVID-19 city.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.480]   Already in January of 2021, they're talking about 20 minute neighborhoods.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.239]  Now, again, they say 20 minutes.
[00:25:59.333 --> 00:26:05.137]  The plan really is for a 30 minute city and that is evidenced in a number of places.
[00:26:05.197 --> 00:26:14.202]  But what I want to talk to you about is the organisation CLARA, which stands for the Consolidated Land and Rail Australia.
[00:26:15.143 --> 00:26:33.029]   This organisation Clara are actually, they've posted the high-speed rail, they're talking about the smart cities that they're going to be pioneering on the east coast of Australia, which just so happens to be the place that's getting rain constantly, we've been told.
[00:26:33.089 --> 00:26:36.950]  It's been blamed on La Nina, which of course is not a new thing.
[00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:40.193]  But we've been told that it's going to happen for the next six months.
[00:26:40.233 --> 00:26:44.759]  We're going to have wild weather and this is of course due to climate change immediately.
[00:26:45.159 --> 00:26:48.042]  We've declared a climate emergency in one of our states.
[00:26:48.062 --> 00:26:54.430]  We've now got a climate change bill in Australia that's passed parliament with no pushback.
[00:26:55.111 --> 00:27:04.674]  Mind you, within the Climate Change Bill of 2022, there is zero detail on how they're actually going to tackle climate change.
[00:27:04.714 --> 00:27:06.055]  There are zero strategies.
[00:27:06.135 --> 00:27:12.617]  It just references the Paris Agreement of 2015, which again, has no strategies.
[00:27:12.937 --> 00:27:27.897]   It talks about gender equality being a climate change problem and how climate change impacts women's domestic duties But zero solutions as to how they're actually going to fight it.
[00:27:28.357 --> 00:27:33.441]  And of course, we know that all of their plans for alternative energy, I mean, they're not even ready for that.
[00:27:33.841 --> 00:27:35.042]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:27:35.062 --> 00:27:47.631]  But I want the team to play a quick, this quick clip from Clara, and then we'll break down that, that clip because everything that they do is they present to you this wonderful idea and it sounds great.
[00:27:48.271 --> 00:27:50.213]  And this is the modern age of propaganda.
[00:27:50.233 --> 00:27:51.113]  This is how they do it.
[00:27:51.173 --> 00:27:53.495]  This is, this is modern warfare.
[00:27:54.435 --> 00:28:11.783]  Lying to you, telling you that what they're offering you is good and you don't need your former way of living, you don't need traditional family values, you don't need to have freedom of movement because we're going to offer you a solution that's good for the planet and saving the koalas or whatever.
[00:28:11.603 --> 00:28:16.643]   But here's the clip of Clara if the team have got it ready and then we'll do an analysis on that.
[00:28:16.643 --> 00:28:28.403]   Spread across the globe there are cities considered the most livable in the world.
[00:28:28.618 --> 00:28:32.481]  Cities such as Melbourne, Copenhagen, Vienna and Geneva.
[00:28:32.982 --> 00:28:38.567]  Understanding what makes these cities attractive is a key factor in planning for the future.
[00:28:39.648 --> 00:28:41.850]  Highly liveable cities share a bunch of attributes.
[00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:44.452]  They're walkable and have good public transport.
[00:28:44.552 --> 00:28:46.434]  They have jobs and educational opportunities.
[00:28:47.349 --> 00:28:54.501]  You feel safe, connected to the people in your neighbourhood and you like living there because it has its own unique sense of place and character.
[00:28:55.844 --> 00:28:59.791]  Add to that affordable housing and lifestyle and well, who wouldn't want to live there?
[00:29:01.792 --> 00:29:02.172]  Liveable.
[00:29:02.433 --> 00:29:03.033]  Sustainable.
[00:29:03.233 --> 00:29:03.653]  Connected.
[00:29:04.334 --> 00:29:06.135]  That's what makes a city attractive.
[00:29:06.776 --> 00:29:10.499]  It's also what makes it a hub for economic, social and cultural life.
[00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:16.843]  Liveable means that a city's design is human-centric, neighbourhood-based, vibrant and affordable.
[00:29:17.364 --> 00:29:24.049]  A sustainable city is self-sufficient, uses less energy and enables a more environmentally aware lifestyle.
[00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:30.494]  A connected city includes physical connections, technological networks and human relationships.
[00:29:31.203 --> 00:29:36.645]  The CLARA Plan brings together six place pillars to create liveable, sustainable and connected cities.
[00:29:37.625 --> 00:29:43.968]  These pillars, or founding principles, are the key to CLARA's long-term success and underpin every aspect of design and planning.
[00:29:44.728 --> 00:29:48.567]   By focusing on people and place from the start, the cities will naturally continue
[00:29:48.567 --> 00:29:52.248]  to attract new residents, businesses, creativity and ideas.
[00:29:52.248 --> 00:30:08.407]  So they kept repeating the words 'liveable', 'highly liveable'.
[00:30:09.135 --> 00:30:12.697]  Well, what's not liveable about the places that we live now?
[00:30:13.597 --> 00:30:16.439]  What's not liveable about a rural area?
[00:30:16.879 --> 00:30:20.321]  Why do you need to keep reminding us that these cities are liveable?
[00:30:22.182 --> 00:30:25.064]  What is it about the country that's not liveable?
[00:30:25.544 --> 00:30:27.966]  What is it about living in the mountains that's not liveable?
[00:30:29.168 --> 00:30:34.913]  The level of thinking and propaganda that's gone into this language, and these people understand the power of words.
[00:30:35.513 --> 00:30:39.276]  So they use specific language when they sell you their ideas.
[00:30:39.736 --> 00:30:43.539]  And the problem here is, you know, the whole idea of a smart city.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.481]  Sure, it's great.
[00:30:45.881 --> 00:30:49.363]  I don't have to travel more than half an hour to get to work.
[00:30:49.403 --> 00:30:55.928]  A lot of people, you know, especially here in Sydney, my goodness, two hours sometimes in the car in peak hour traffic.
[00:30:56.129 --> 00:30:56.649]  Fair enough.
[00:30:57.455 --> 00:31:02.096]  But the problem is that they don't want to give you the choice of living in these highly liveable cities.
[00:31:02.637 --> 00:31:08.618]  They want to push you into living into these highly liveable cities, which is why they have to keep marketing it that way.
[00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:12.519]  Because they don't want people living in urban areas.
[00:31:12.599 --> 00:31:14.840]  And shortly we'll go through the map.
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:23.423]  One of the maps here in Australia, in Sydney, where they plan on splitting the city up into three districts, what they call districts.
[00:31:25.327 --> 00:31:30.788]  It actually has the borders of where they don't want you to go past.
[00:31:31.328 --> 00:31:39.469]  Now, they don't say that, and we'll get into that in a moment, but going back to this Clara video, so they talk about connected.
[00:31:40.610 --> 00:32:00.309]   Now, in the government grants for all of the smart cities, and there are many different projects that are happening in Australia, I broke this down a while ago, you can find it on my website, Australia's Smart Cities Revealed, they talk about Smart lights, smart parking, all of these things are great concepts.
[00:32:00.869 --> 00:32:06.751]  But then there's also street furniture that monitors human behavior and reports back to the Internet of Things.
[00:32:07.711 --> 00:32:16.494]  Of course, this is sold as, well, we're going to monitor pedestrian activity to help us, you know, manage traffic and manage the movement of people.
[00:32:16.554 --> 00:32:18.995]  Well, what do you need to manage the movement of people for?
[00:32:19.655 --> 00:32:24.148]   It really is about linking everyone To the Internet of Things.
[00:32:24.208 --> 00:32:25.429]  And how are they going to achieve that?
[00:32:25.449 --> 00:32:28.311]  Well, that's going to be through digital ID.
[00:32:28.712 --> 00:32:34.757]  We'll talk about digital ID a bit later on in the broadcast, but basically, this is already happening.
[00:32:35.238 --> 00:32:43.405]  Here in Australia, you've got directors of companies that are not able to continue being a director unless they get a digital ID.
[00:32:44.066 --> 00:32:46.468]  This isn't something that's coming.
[00:32:46.748 --> 00:32:48.130]  This is already here.
[00:32:48.826 --> 00:32:51.088]  This is already here in Australia.
[00:32:51.408 --> 00:32:52.289]  Compulsory.
[00:32:52.609 --> 00:32:53.289]  Mandatory.
[00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:54.510]  One number.
[00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:57.192]  A universal number.
[00:32:58.073 --> 00:32:58.774]  International.
[00:32:58.914 --> 00:33:01.195]  Everyone in the world will know your number.
[00:33:01.616 --> 00:33:04.398]  Or every global government will know your number.
[00:33:04.938 --> 00:33:07.160]  And you can't conduct business without it.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.062]  And you keep that number for the rest of your life.
[00:33:10.182 --> 00:33:11.824]  And it's linked to your bank account.
[00:33:11.924 --> 00:33:13.405]  It's linked to your credit cards.
[00:33:13.505 --> 00:33:17.508]  It's linked to your home, you know, energy consumption.
[00:33:18.251 --> 00:33:25.676]  And ultimately, your social credit score will be back right after this break to delve more into all of those topics.
[00:33:29.927 --> 00:33:34.090]  Welcome back to this Sunday's broadcast of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:37.532]  I'm your host Maria Zee from ZeeMedia.com with Threes.
[00:33:38.112 --> 00:33:47.097]  We're talking about smart cities and the plan for total global enslavement through these smart cities that they're not really giving you a choice about.
[00:33:47.138 --> 00:33:48.698]  They want you in those cities.
[00:33:48.738 --> 00:33:57.604]  We know that the World Economic Forum said that people will be pushed into urban areas as part of Agenda 2030 and this is exactly what this is all about.
[00:33:57.964 --> 00:34:04.209]  You know, we've got mainstream media here in Australia reporting on building back better for the Lismore flood victims.
[00:34:04.289 --> 00:34:09.132]  Over 50,000 people reportedly displaced from their homes as a result of this flooding.
[00:34:09.393 --> 00:34:11.915]  And they're openly telling us about their cloud seeding projects.
[00:34:11.935 --> 00:34:18.059]  We just had, I believe it was Japan talking about how proud they are about weather modification.
[00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:20.801]  And I mean, you know, they don't even hide this stuff anymore.
[00:34:20.821 --> 00:34:26.445]  But I want to get into this website, greatercities.au, where they actually talk about these districts.
[00:34:26.485 --> 00:34:31.611]   And this is where The team did a great job before they brought up the map of the districts.
[00:34:32.472 --> 00:34:40.541]  It describes the plan to split Sydney, the city of Sydney, into a metropolis of three cities with the use of the words districts, right?
[00:34:40.581 --> 00:34:42.724]  This is dystopian stuff, guys.
[00:34:43.084 --> 00:34:47.566]  The plan is that most residents will live within 30 minutes of all services, including their jobs.
[00:34:47.586 --> 00:34:49.427]  Well, what's so sinister about that?
[00:34:49.827 --> 00:34:54.529]  What happens when you leave your district or you leave the boundary?
[00:34:54.549 --> 00:34:58.471]  See, on that map that you're looking at now, you can see the yellow borders.
[00:34:59.091 --> 00:35:01.353]  This is what they call the district boundary.
[00:35:01.413 --> 00:35:06.958]  Now, I want to acknowledge here that, you know, this is regular language that councils may use.
[00:35:07.018 --> 00:35:18.728]  They may talk about district boundaries or region boundaries, you know, certain government organizations that are allocated to looking after these districts or regions, you know, we won't ignore that.
[00:35:19.268 --> 00:35:26.368]   But the reality is that they talk about The fact that they don't want you leaving this area because it's bad for the environment.
[00:35:26.728 --> 00:35:44.100]  And if you look at that district, anyone who's familiar with the city of Sydney, you would notice that the edge of those yellow borders there are actually pretty much where you start to get, I mean, apart from a couple of suburbs there, you start to get more, you know, greener places.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.722]  You get the mountains, you get a forest land.
[00:35:47.782 --> 00:35:49.303]  They don't want you living in there.
[00:35:49.343 --> 00:35:51.965]  See, they want to push you into these three districts.
[00:35:52.465 --> 00:35:54.465]  Where everything is connected.
[00:35:55.086 --> 00:36:06.408]  They go on to talk about collaborative leadership being an essential factor in successful innovation of districts around the world and the Alliance.
[00:36:06.508 --> 00:36:12.929]  They make reference to the Alliance will enable a unified voice and a long-term perspective.
[00:36:13.009 --> 00:36:18.830]  This is the plan for the whole world to put you into these districts.
[00:36:19.744 --> 00:36:23.826]  Now, what is the digital ID going to enable them to do?
[00:36:23.866 --> 00:36:25.806]  Well, what happens when you leave your district?
[00:36:25.866 --> 00:36:30.068]  What happens when you go even one metre outside of your district?
[00:36:30.088 --> 00:36:37.611]  We know that during the lockdowns here in Australia, they actually said to us that we can't travel more than 10 kilometres from our homes.
[00:36:37.631 --> 00:36:44.034]  Then it was five kilometres from our homes, because apparently COVID knows the difference between five and six kilometres.
[00:36:44.054 --> 00:36:48.215]  You're not going to catch it if you travel five kilometres, you won't spread it.
[00:36:48.235 --> 00:36:50.871]   But if you travel six, Then COVID will spread.
[00:36:50.951 --> 00:37:04.664]  This is the lunacy of what we went through and they even went to the stage of saying that even if grocery stores are more than five kilometres here in Western Sydney, they said even if grocery stores are more than five kilometres you can't travel to that grocery store.
[00:37:04.984 --> 00:37:11.590]  They later backflipped on that but that was real advice for the so-called management of the virus that happened during the lockdown.
[00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:20.453]   So This was a conditioning tool for telling you what you can and can't eat, what you can and can't, where you can and can't go.
[00:37:20.473 --> 00:37:32.541]  You know, five minutes ago, they were selling you the great Aussie dream and the great American dream of owning your own home and having something to pass on to your generations.
[00:37:32.601 --> 00:37:36.204]  And now all of a sudden it's, you'll own nothing, you'll be happy.
[00:37:36.484 --> 00:37:38.345]  It's a complete backflip.
[00:37:38.545 --> 00:37:47.397]   And the reason why is because everything that they've sold you about human success, It has depended on people trusting the system, trusting the corporations.
[00:37:47.457 --> 00:37:58.270]  Go to uni, get a corporate job, you know, climb the corporate ladder so that you can afford the great Aussie dream or the great American dream.
[00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.494]  Meanwhile, they're removing land titles.
[00:38:02.725 --> 00:38:15.016]  And, you know, now the Australian government has this tactic of, well, first homes are so unaffordable that the government's going to help you by giving you more of an incentive to buy, but they're going to own 40% of your home.
[00:38:15.656 --> 00:38:18.359]  And eventually that'll be 100, because they don't want you to own anything.
[00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:20.841]  They don't want you to have any type of independence.
[00:38:22.142 --> 00:38:25.625]  So back to these districts, you know, they even had a map.
[00:38:26.677 --> 00:38:42.824]  At the time of the lockdowns where you could punch in your address and it would show you a circle of exactly how far you're allowed to travel based on whatever nonsense science told you that you can't leave your district.
[00:38:42.864 --> 00:38:50.740]   So when they implement these digital IDs, and again, Mandatory for company directors here in Australia already as of November.
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:55.004]  This year, you cannot own a company unless you have a digital ID.
[00:38:55.024 --> 00:38:57.626]  So, as Alex always says, it's a corporate takeover.
[00:38:57.686 --> 00:38:58.367]  Why does he say that?
[00:38:58.387 --> 00:39:00.529]  Well, because they start with the corporations first.
[00:39:00.849 --> 00:39:07.976]  People are more interested in their pocket than living independently and trying to find a way to live outside of the system.
[00:39:07.996 --> 00:39:10.218]  And the reality is that we're resourceful individuals.
[00:39:10.238 --> 00:39:11.720]  We don't need their system.
[00:39:12.566 --> 00:39:18.609]  We can build our own system, but not enough people want to do it and it's just easier to be plugged into their matrix.
[00:39:18.649 --> 00:39:36.617]  But the digital ID will be locked to your social security number, your Medicare, your health care, they'll be sharing your info with private corporations and you'll have no privacy.
[00:39:37.478 --> 00:39:43.941]  No one knows who these private corporations are, or if we know who they are, we don't know what agenda is behind that.
[00:39:45.421 --> 00:39:51.523]  Your tax file number, your car registration, your credit card, everything will be linked to this digital ID.
[00:39:51.543 --> 00:39:54.124]  So what happens when you leave your district?
[00:39:55.085 --> 00:40:00.687]  When you leave that little border, what happens if you want to go to the mountains one day outside of your district?
[00:40:01.795 --> 00:40:05.577]  What, all of a sudden your social credit score is impacted?
[00:40:05.617 --> 00:40:07.719]  Your tax file number so you can't work?
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.040]  Your health care?
[00:40:11.021 --> 00:40:15.504]  What if you're a diabetic and you go and you eat a donut?
[00:40:17.165 --> 00:40:20.467]  What, all of a sudden your private health insurance is cancelled?
[00:40:21.407 --> 00:40:23.449]  You're not able to access medical services?
[00:40:23.489 --> 00:40:26.271]  The digital ID is so dangerous.
[00:40:26.631 --> 00:40:28.432]  It is, and they've used COVID.
[00:40:29.373 --> 00:40:33.057]  And their whole, oh, well, the tracking and tracing that we did during COVID.
[00:40:33.077 --> 00:40:35.058]  Look how well the Melbourne experiment went.
[00:40:35.078 --> 00:40:36.820]  Look how well the other countries went.
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:42.745]  This human living lab has enabled us to look after the climate.
[00:40:43.025 --> 00:40:45.447]  And we've, you know, you can see how this all links.
[00:40:46.068 --> 00:40:49.330]  So they've used that as an excuse to roll out this global digital ID.
[00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:53.494]  But all that it spells is complete digital enslavement.
[00:40:53.814 --> 00:41:02.203]   You won't be able to make one move Without the government watching everything that you do and it'll all, I mean, who's to say?
[00:41:02.244 --> 00:41:03.945]  They backflip on this stuff all the time.
[00:41:04.966 --> 00:41:08.548]  Last, five minutes ago, we were in threat of an ice age.
[00:41:09.329 --> 00:41:11.050]  Now we're at threat of global warming.
[00:41:11.551 --> 00:41:14.273]  So the science can change at any given time.
[00:41:15.954 --> 00:41:27.486]   The science around climate change, the science around your health can change at any given time and they can, You know, the control that they will have through the digital IDs is limitless.
[00:41:28.608 --> 00:41:32.374]  Because at any given moment, they could just simply say, well, the science has changed now.
[00:41:33.997 --> 00:41:35.478]  We've already seen them doing that.
[00:41:35.698 --> 00:41:38.961]  I saw a recent statement from the German Health Minister.
[00:41:39.181 --> 00:41:40.562]  It was the most ridiculous thing.
[00:41:40.582 --> 00:41:44.505]  He was saying that the unvaccinated are a risk.
[00:41:45.085 --> 00:41:49.228]  This is their excuse for continuing to push the injections on the unvaccinated.
[00:41:49.549 --> 00:41:52.751]  If you're not injected by now, you're probably never getting injected, right?
[00:41:52.771 --> 00:42:05.511]   But he's saying the unvaccinated are more of a risk because When you're vaccinated, you're more likely to get the virus quicker, develop symptoms quicker and go and get tested.
[00:42:06.371 --> 00:42:11.594]  Whereas if you're unvaccinated, you're likely to develop symptoms a lot slower.
[00:42:11.614 --> 00:42:14.095]  It makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:42:15.335 --> 00:42:16.896]  And none of what they do makes sense.
[00:42:20.158 --> 00:42:28.699]   You've got the International Energy Agency demanding, excuse me, Worldwide lockdowns.
[00:42:28.719 --> 00:42:38.043]  Forgive me, guys.
[00:42:40.844 --> 00:42:44.066]  Worldwide lockdowns to meet climate goals.
[00:42:45.706 --> 00:42:47.267]  This is how they're going to do it.
[00:42:49.288 --> 00:42:52.229]  Through their new religion of climate change.
[00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:58.795]   And in this IEA, International Energy Agency, 10-point plan to cut oil use.
[00:43:00.636 --> 00:43:02.237]  They want to reduce the speed limits.
[00:43:02.297 --> 00:43:02.917]  Okay, fine.
[00:43:04.258 --> 00:43:04.778]  Excuse me.
[00:43:08.921 --> 00:43:09.781]  Reduce speed limits.
[00:43:09.841 --> 00:43:10.522]  Okay, that's fine.
[00:43:10.562 --> 00:43:11.822]  Make public transport cheaper.
[00:43:11.902 --> 00:43:12.243]  Fine.
[00:43:12.803 --> 00:43:14.664]  Car-free Sundays in large cities.
[00:43:16.025 --> 00:43:17.686]  They don't want you driving a vehicle.
[00:43:18.426 --> 00:43:22.729]  And if you do drive a vehicle, they want it to be electric so that you can't leave your district.
[00:43:22.769 --> 00:43:25.010]  And if you do, they just switch it off.
[00:43:26.576 --> 00:43:29.717]  Look how easy it will be when everything is linked.
[00:43:30.797 --> 00:43:35.838]  As part of the plan, they want more people working from home up to three days a week where possible.
[00:43:36.499 --> 00:43:42.720]  Again, going into that working from home cell where, you know, it's a good thing.
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.721]  You get more freedom working from home.
[00:43:45.741 --> 00:43:46.741]  You have more time.
[00:43:46.781 --> 00:43:47.881]  Your expenses are less.
[00:43:49.282 --> 00:43:54.537]   Meanwhile, All of your social interaction is completely gone.
[00:43:55.137 --> 00:44:00.199]  We'll wrap up this information in the next segment and then we'll start taking some calls.
[00:44:00.739 --> 00:44:05.060]  If people have questions about Australia, I'll see you soon.
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:12.420]   We are now inside the operational phase of global cultural and economic societal collapse.
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:26.180]   Senate reports, DHS reports, journalistic reports confirming millions and millions
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:33.220]   and millions of people walking right across mainly the Texas border now and massive human smuggling
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:39.460]   run by the Biden administration through NGOs, non-governmental organizations,
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:46.019]   with on camera thousands of children at bus stops and airports a day.
[00:44:46.239 --> 00:44:54.128]   Children as young as six months old With no paperwork, not with their parents being given to other people with no paperwork.
[00:44:54.697 --> 00:45:07.385]  I read a story yesterday of a 10-year-old girl who was processed through our own government, delivered to a family, and then put in a house, raped, abused, and cut in supposedly the greatest country in the world.
[00:45:07.645 --> 00:45:12.669]  And we have stash houses with 73 people in it, 13 kids in our nation's capital?
[00:45:13.009 --> 00:45:14.109]  I'm tired of this crap.
[00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:19.413]  Actual child kidnapping and trafficking on an industrial scale.
[00:45:19.913 --> 00:45:22.675]  I spent more than a week in Central America recently.
[00:45:23.116 --> 00:45:27.219]  I had the opportunity actually to interview a human trafficker.
[00:45:27.339 --> 00:45:31.422]  Is it easier to traffic the children and get them in than the adults?
[00:45:33.143 --> 00:45:40.168]  It's more risky because once we get to the cartels, they are asking for children, for them to traffic with drugs.
[00:45:40.288 --> 00:45:46.273]  In the case of children, it really scares him to just see the reality that they can go through.
[00:45:47.208 --> 00:45:52.879]  And for him, it's pretty horrific to see how they are murdered in many cases.
[00:45:52.979 --> 00:45:57.809]  What about people that want to buy a child because they're a sexual predator?
[00:45:59.629 --> 00:46:17.247]  I've heard that some people and places have very specific things that they like certain nationalities or certain age groups so the Cardos are looking for the people going around and when they spot someone with those characteristics they tend to like take them.
[00:46:18.368 --> 00:46:22.450]  In most cases, they wanted to sell their organs, so that is the reason they take children.
[00:46:22.811 --> 00:46:24.431]  That's very hard to hear.
[00:46:25.532 --> 00:46:26.733]  Yes, it's very hard.
[00:46:26.973 --> 00:46:32.696]  Sometimes they take out the organs and they refill the body with drugs so they can take it to the border.
[00:46:32.896 --> 00:46:38.199]  Do they sell them to hospitals or to buyers, like private buyers, wealthy buyers?
[00:46:38.539 --> 00:46:45.324]  There are people with money that want to buy the organs of kids and it's not only for a country.
[00:46:45.344 --> 00:46:50.787]  They take it to different countries and normally they do this with clinics that are not authorized.
[00:46:51.228 --> 00:46:52.469]  Absolute next level.
[00:46:52.509 --> 00:46:58.493]  We know the globalists are obsessed with child trafficking, obsessed with pedophilia, obsessed with sexualization of children.
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:21.657]  An anonymous whistleblower has come forward sitting down with Xavier Hernandez, who works as a travel youth care worker for a federally funded contractor, and shares that tens of thousands of unaccompanied migrant children, so two to five thousand a week, are being bused and flown throughout the United States and handed off to, quote, unvetted adult sponsors.
[00:47:22.077 --> 00:47:34.105]   The employee, and she actually gives us the name, MVM Inc., said the The company's main focus is getting unaccompanied minors from quote point A shelters to point B sponsors across the United States.
[00:47:34.466 --> 00:47:44.832]  You need to understand that we are looking at an operation of not only human trafficking, but in this case, child trafficking.
[00:47:44.872 --> 00:47:51.496]  For those of us in the audience who might not know what NVMink is, can you explain to us what your company is and what they do?
[00:47:51.516 --> 00:48:00.746]   It's a company that focuses on getting They call the Houston's unaccompanied children, unaccompanied minors.
[00:48:01.406 --> 00:48:11.969]  Getting them from point A to point B. And most of the time point A is from a shelter all throughout Texas and all across the country.
[00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:15.130]  And point B is with a sponsor.
[00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:17.451]  Most of the time it's a family member.
[00:48:18.051 --> 00:48:24.131]   But maybe the numbers are so crazy that it's no longer family members, it's family friends,
[00:48:24.131 --> 00:48:31.650]   people who are willing to take them in. And a lot of the times they don't even know each other.
[00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:36.531]   So if you could give us an estimate, how many children per month do you think are being moved
[00:48:36.531 --> 00:48:38.770]  just in the Texas area?
[00:48:38.971 --> 00:48:44.871]   Like I said, it's between all the All the offices, it's in the thousands.
[00:48:44.951 --> 00:48:47.653]  I say 8 to 10, but that's in one week.
[00:48:48.014 --> 00:48:53.018]  So in a month, I would say around 40,000, 30,000 kids.
[00:48:53.038 --> 00:48:58.463]  30 to 40,000 children a month being given away to Perfect Strangers with no record.
[00:48:58.523 --> 00:49:02.186]  This is Jeffrey Epstein Island on Warp Speed.
[00:49:04.099 --> 00:49:07.181]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show this Sunday.
[00:49:07.201 --> 00:49:09.923]  I'm your host, Maria Zee from ZMedia.com.
[00:49:09.943 --> 00:49:22.812]  We're talking about smart cities, the plan for complete and total world enslavement by pushing people out of urban areas into these smart cities where everything that you do think, say, will be tracked and traced.
[00:49:23.567 --> 00:49:27.870]  We've been going into the Australian plans, but there is one more plan that I want to highlight here.
[00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:30.772]  It's the Bathurst plan to transform into a smart city by 2025.
[00:49:31.032 --> 00:49:41.979]  Saw Jay Dyer do a fantastic analysis just the other day on their plans and the decades, the 2030, 2040 and 2050.
[00:49:42.859 --> 00:49:48.723]  But this is, you know, really by 2025, they want to do this to the city of Bathurst in New South Wales.
[00:49:48.743 --> 00:49:58.767]   And it basically, this entire plan includes things like App linked to shopping to prevent you from purchasing food that you do not need.
[00:49:59.548 --> 00:50:05.389]  So they plan on watching everything that you purchase and telling you what you do and don't need.
[00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:11.190]  You think you're going to have the choice of saying, oh, you know, maybe I don't need that today.
[00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:11.610]  No, no, no.
[00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:14.391]  The government's going to tell you what you do and don't need.
[00:50:15.313 --> 00:50:17.734]  And I mean, this is just unbelievable control.
[00:50:17.774 --> 00:50:21.315]  We're already seeing them destroying the food supply everywhere.
[00:50:21.615 --> 00:50:26.956]  You know, wheat plants, bread factories, chicken processing farms.
[00:50:28.377 --> 00:50:29.257]  All on fire.
[00:50:29.817 --> 00:50:34.358]  All of a sudden, by coincidence, I don't know, maybe we can blame climate change for that.
[00:50:35.319 --> 00:50:37.299]  They're already destroying the food supply.
[00:50:37.479 --> 00:50:42.300]  And this, on top of that, will control what you are and are not able to purchase.
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:50.725]   And of course, as we discussed before, Should you go and make a purchase that is outside of what you do and don't need, that'll impact your social credit score.
[00:50:50.745 --> 00:50:56.326]  But beyond that, according to this, it will probably stop you from even making the purchase.
[00:50:57.047 --> 00:51:07.069]  So, totally dictating to you people who want to see you malnourished and poisoned dictating to you what you can and can't buy.
[00:51:07.369 --> 00:51:08.289]  That's what this means.
[00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:17.481]   It goes on to say apps that can monitor and notify energy use Thereby adjusting the use, and it also talks about limiting water usage to households.
[00:51:17.561 --> 00:51:26.164]  So, you know, we've got Germany telling their people to wash themselves with a wet cloth rather than having showers.
[00:51:27.164 --> 00:51:37.648]  They want to completely dehumanize people, make them completely lose any sense of pride in their humanity, any sense of patriotism.
[00:51:38.288 --> 00:51:40.769]  This is what the... I spoke about this just last night.
[00:51:41.089 --> 00:51:47.096]   This is what That's what allowing so many migrants into the country is about.
[00:51:47.277 --> 00:51:53.001]  I'm not against a multi-ethnic society.
[00:51:53.021 --> 00:51:53.901]  I'm not against that.
[00:51:54.662 --> 00:52:07.864]   But what I am against is their plan to destroy patriotism through demoralizing the society because if they can do that, If people lose this sense of identity and pride in their country, they're less likely to fight for it.
[00:52:08.184 --> 00:52:18.171]  They're less likely to fight for the freedom of Australia if Australia is no longer free, if Australia is no longer Australia, if the United States is no longer the United States.
[00:52:18.991 --> 00:52:21.333]  They want to destroy your national identity.
[00:52:21.473 --> 00:52:25.956]  They want to destroy any love that you have for your country.
[00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:30.960]  And this is why they've put these leaders in place that make you hate the government.
[00:52:32.242 --> 00:52:36.125]  And make you look at them and say, what is this incompetent clown show that we're watching?
[00:52:37.366 --> 00:52:39.588]  Because they want you to hate your country.
[00:52:40.108 --> 00:52:42.170]  They want you to lose that sense of pride.
[00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:44.312]  Because then you won't stand up for it.
[00:52:45.273 --> 00:52:50.036]  And we must never, ever lose that sense of patriotism and allow for these plans.
[00:52:50.997 --> 00:52:56.762]  They go on to talk about the final thing I want to highlight in this Bathurst plan.
[00:52:57.990 --> 00:53:02.654]  They talk about drone technology for compliance monitoring.
[00:53:03.335 --> 00:53:07.158]  Drone technology for compliance monitoring.
[00:53:07.198 --> 00:53:13.384]  Now, granted, within this document, they say that, you know, this is relevant to the construction industry, but they have to start somewhere, right?
[00:53:13.744 --> 00:53:17.968]  And they have to disguise their plans for monitoring you somewhere.
[00:53:19.332 --> 00:53:24.655]  I keep talking about the fact that all these people have said, oh, you know, I got vaccinated so I can go and travel.
[00:53:24.976 --> 00:53:38.063]  And yet they're destroying the travel industry, limiting flights because of CO2 and, you know, the climate and staff shortages because everyone's off sick, because their immune systems are destroyed, whoever's remaining.
[00:53:39.544 --> 00:53:43.486]  But they're actually destroying the travel industry because they want clearer airways.
[00:53:44.494 --> 00:53:48.516]  To make room for more drones, to make room for more surveillance.
[00:53:49.617 --> 00:53:51.818]  It's going to be a big brother.
[00:53:51.838 --> 00:53:57.181]  Police, state, constant monitored city.
[00:53:57.461 --> 00:53:58.962]  No one wants this.
[00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:00.723]  Nobody wants this.
[00:54:00.803 --> 00:54:11.284]   And I want to say here, guys, how crucial Supporting independent media is in these times because this is something you will never hear in the mainstream media.
[00:54:11.744 --> 00:54:29.954]  The mainstream media would love to sweep COVID under the rug, sweep the bioweapon death shots under the rug, sweep all the people that are dying from sudden adult death syndrome in the droves under the rug and pretend this is all normal and blame it on climate change.
[00:54:31.175 --> 00:54:33.156]  They want you to forget their crimes.
[00:54:35.123 --> 00:54:46.013]  Independent media is the part of this puzzle that is going to show you what they're doing next because the battle is not over.
[00:54:46.654 --> 00:54:48.636]  In fact, we've only just started.
[00:54:49.276 --> 00:55:00.207]  COVID was a children's playground compared to the totalitarianism that they want to implement globally.
[00:55:01.528 --> 00:55:07.813]  So independent media plays the most crucial role right now because this is an information war.
[00:55:08.253 --> 00:55:14.177]  This is a war on your very mind, on the psychology of humanity.
[00:55:14.217 --> 00:55:15.778]  It is a psychological war.
[00:55:16.179 --> 00:55:28.550]   It is one where the propaganda, and this is why I played the Clara clip earlier, the team played it for us, because You watch the way that they present these things and the language that they use.
[00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:30.531]  These people understand the power of words.
[00:55:30.951 --> 00:55:36.614]  This is why they keep changing the definition of words, because they know that words have power.
[00:55:36.654 --> 00:55:41.237]  So when they tell you that something is good, it's actually evil.
[00:55:41.697 --> 00:55:48.641]  When they tell you that something is a livable city, it actually means that it's going to be very hard for you to live there.
[00:55:49.341 --> 00:55:59.867]   When they tell you that something is good for the planet, The double speak there is that it's good for them to have access to all the greenery in the world.
[00:55:59.927 --> 00:56:09.176]  Meanwhile, you're confined to your district that has borders that don't allow you to go to the green parts of the earth because that's reserved for the self-proclaimed elites.
[00:56:10.777 --> 00:56:15.441]  Everything that they do is double speak and they've already got plans.
[00:56:15.461 --> 00:56:16.282]  We saw that leak.
[00:56:16.983 --> 00:56:22.708]  From Trudeau installing weapons armories, interrogation rooms for his Ministry of Climate Change.
[00:56:22.728 --> 00:56:43.347]  A similar thing happened in France, where they launched their Climate Change Police Force, where the French Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin, was hiring 3,000 green police officers to go after those who violate green-related criminal issues, to safeguard the country from disasters that are supposedly caused by humans.
[00:56:45.123 --> 00:56:47.824]  You see, you were the enemy during COVID.
[00:56:49.124 --> 00:56:51.625]  The unvaccinated were the enemy.
[00:56:51.725 --> 00:56:53.145]  Human beings were the enemy.
[00:56:53.205 --> 00:56:57.167]  They were the carriers of the deadly virus that was going to take out humanity.
[00:56:58.007 --> 00:57:01.188]  And the same tactic will be used with climate change.
[00:57:01.348 --> 00:57:02.748]  You are the enemy.
[00:57:03.088 --> 00:57:04.849]  You breathing is the enemy.
[00:57:04.969 --> 00:57:10.030]  You having a farm and living independently is the enemy because your cows are emitting gases.
[00:57:11.031 --> 00:57:14.821]   You having birds Chickens is the enemy.
[00:57:14.841 --> 00:57:21.944]  You know, here in Queensland, in the state of Queensland in Australia, you need a license, technically, to share your eggs with people.
[00:57:23.085 --> 00:57:33.430]  There was recently a legislation, the Agriculture Bill that was passed in Victoria, that prevents people from sharing meat that they've obtained through hunting.
[00:57:34.531 --> 00:57:35.751]  You can't share your meat.
[00:57:37.672 --> 00:57:43.390]   You are the enemy of the planet Why can't you share your meat?
[00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:47.311]  Why can't you go and have your own chickens?
[00:57:47.611 --> 00:57:49.952]  Why can't you go and have your own land?
[00:57:51.632 --> 00:57:55.593]  Because they paint you and human beings as the disease.
[00:57:56.954 --> 00:58:02.455]  They paint you as the problem of the earth and they are coming with their solution, with their one world government.
[00:58:02.896 --> 00:58:17.004]   And of course, the more they demoralize society, the more that they make you feel that you are nothing, The more you'll stop fighting, this is exactly why we have to keep fighting.
[00:58:17.325 --> 00:58:19.565]  In the next segment, we're going to take some calls.
[00:58:19.845 --> 00:58:26.847]  We've got the number here and I'm opening the lines for people to ask questions specifically about Australia.
[00:58:27.287 --> 00:58:32.129]  Any of the things that you've seen here and how that may relate to your country and what they're going to do next.
[00:58:32.289 --> 00:58:43.489]   The number to call is 877-789-2539 or 877-789-ALEX and I look forward to speaking with you guys
[00:58:43.615 --> 00:58:47.175]   Again, we're going to talk about the plans that they've implemented here, any questions
[00:58:47.175 --> 00:58:52.974]   that you guys have about Australia specifically or anything that we've spoken about today,
[00:58:52.974 --> 00:59:06.055]  and we can get into your calls right after this break.
[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:15.089]  It is so important to support independent media and InfoWars is a broadcast that is completely funded by the people, for the people.
[00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:18.273]  No big pharma funding here, no Pfizer ads.
[00:59:18.653 --> 00:59:21.758]  The DNA Force Plus from InfoWarsLife is back at 50% off.
[00:59:21.858 --> 00:59:30.291]  It is the perfect formula to help you support optimal energy levels while adapting your body to handle the daily bombardment of toxins.
[00:59:30.331 --> 00:59:31.473]  We are under attack.
[00:59:31.794 --> 00:59:33.196]  They're spraying us like bugs.
[00:59:33.911 --> 00:59:43.479]  They're attacking us through our food, our water supply, and InfoWars has been at the forefront of protecting people and their health.
[00:59:43.939 --> 00:59:50.384]  So we know that it's important to supplement your body with the most potent bioavailable antioxidants.
[00:59:50.404 --> 00:59:52.206]  DNA Force Plus allows for this.
[00:59:53.407 --> 01:00:05.259]  Elevate TPs, PQQ, CQ10, Organic Reishi and all of these ingredients were chosen for their ability to help support heart function and cellular energy production.
[01:00:05.339 --> 01:00:11.366]  Support InfoWars today, support this broadcast, support independent media in whatever way you can.
[01:00:11.946 --> 01:00:15.707]  So that they can keep bringing this important information out to you.
[01:00:15.807 --> 01:00:18.328]  Today we are going to take some callers now.
[01:00:18.808 --> 01:00:35.354]  We've got, I've opened up the phone lines, the team has done so on 877-789-2539 or Alex and we're talking about Australia, taking questions about Australia but we've got Travis in Connecticut right now calling about the J&J vaccine.
[01:00:35.374 --> 01:00:36.174]  Travis you're on the air.
[01:00:37.396 --> 01:00:38.937]  Hey Maria, thanks for your call.
[01:00:39.397 --> 01:00:43.000]  I had a question about the Johnson vaccine.
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:51.586]  If you knew if it was less harmful compared to the other vaccines because it's supposedly not mRNA?
[01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:53.107]  Can you tell me more about that?
[01:00:54.207 --> 01:01:00.972]  Yeah, Travis, what I know is that it was pulled off the market in multiple locations, every single one of these vaccines.
[01:01:00.992 --> 01:01:16.445]  So, for example, Novavax, they spoke about the fact that, oh, well, that's a different technology, you know, it's not harmful, but they were using moths and there were multiple studies done on the fact that it is actually just as harmful, but it's in a different way.
[01:01:16.465 --> 01:01:35.894]   I've actually got multiple videos on the safety of Novavax and I would I would caution anyone to be just as cautious of J&J as they are of every single big pharma company because the plan here is a continuous cycle of injections to harm you lifelong.
[01:01:35.934 --> 01:01:47.459]   They want you to have a lifetime subscription to these injections and what will happen is, as your immune system continues being destroyed by these, You'll need more pharmaceutical products to survive.
[01:01:47.859 --> 01:01:52.921]  And this is actually from the patents themselves, that they want you to have a lifetime subscription to injections.
[01:01:52.961 --> 01:02:03.485]  In fact, all the stuff that we were talking about today, where it comes to, you know, linking the digital ID, monitoring everything that you do, is intricately linked with these injections.
[01:02:03.525 --> 01:02:06.166]  In fact, they make it possible to monitor you.
[01:02:06.186 --> 01:02:09.828]  And like I said, it's a lifetime subscription, Travis.
[01:02:09.868 --> 01:02:12.309]  So if possible, stay away from all of it.
[01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:13.429]  They cannot be trusted.
[01:02:14.673 --> 01:02:15.714]  Yeah, that makes total sense.
[01:02:15.814 --> 01:02:16.174]  Thank you.
[01:02:17.315 --> 01:02:18.156]  You're welcome, Travis.
[01:02:18.176 --> 01:02:21.879]  We'll go to Reb in Colorado, who's talking about chemtrails.
[01:02:21.939 --> 01:02:22.700]  Reb, you're on the air.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.141]  Hello, Bill.
[01:02:24.421 --> 01:02:25.442]  Boba Scout, Reb.
[01:02:25.522 --> 01:02:25.762]  U.S.
[01:02:25.822 --> 01:02:27.524]  Pentagon First Team, and I'm Reb.
[01:02:27.824 --> 01:02:31.527]  And we're wondering in Australia, is everything dying?
[01:02:31.867 --> 01:02:35.050]  Like the insect population, you're not even going to have bug seed.
[01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:43.257]  Chemically nucleated ice is forming in times at 40 degrees, and they're giving snowfall, deluge, and drought.
[01:02:44.164 --> 01:02:45.905]  And they're not 500 years.
[01:02:46.145 --> 01:02:47.586]  It's never happened like this.
[01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:51.648]  A hot side to a cold weather front down in Sydney.
[01:02:51.769 --> 01:02:53.750]  I guess it's winter there.
[01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:55.271]  Winter season.
[01:02:55.291 --> 01:02:56.491]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:02:56.511 --> 01:02:59.393]  But up here, it's the worst droughts ever.
[01:02:59.413 --> 01:03:00.253]  They're drying up.
[01:03:00.434 --> 01:03:03.035]  You won't be able to cool the nuclear power plants.
[01:03:03.295 --> 01:03:06.117]  The methane breaking through both poles.
[01:03:06.441 --> 01:03:13.561]   and I understand the algae dying, the whole planet die. I don't think it's going to make it to 2030.
[01:03:13.561 --> 01:03:20.441]   We got to stop those KC-135, KC-12 from dumping aluminum and that graphene.
[01:03:20.441 --> 01:03:24.280]   It's killing you from the sky. And I know I've talked to strangers.
[01:03:24.421 --> 01:03:26.023]  They've taken two and three shots.
[01:03:26.163 --> 01:03:27.364]  They don't even look sick.
[01:03:27.684 --> 01:03:30.467]  They said there's supposed to be a percentage dying.
[01:03:30.487 --> 01:03:32.128]  I don't see anybody dying from that.
[01:03:32.429 --> 01:03:38.995]  It's the red versus the blue, and both sides are getting sprayed on, and they're getting hit with all the... Well, what you're talking about...
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:43.482]  What you're talking about there, Red, is really multi-layered.
[01:03:43.502 --> 01:03:45.023]  They're poisoning us through the skies.
[01:03:45.083 --> 01:03:47.885]  Yes, Australia's skies are being sprayed constantly.
[01:03:47.925 --> 01:03:57.991]  In fact, whenever we have what they're calling rainbombs, you can clearly see a pattern in the skies a day or two or a few days before we have these so-called rainbombs.
[01:03:59.052 --> 01:04:06.679]  So, and they are poisoning us through the skies, because if they don't get you through the injections, if they don't get you through the food supply, they'll get you through the air.
[01:04:07.139 --> 01:04:08.180]  What choice do you have?
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:09.502]  You have to still breathe.
[01:04:09.862 --> 01:04:18.529]   So they are, and it's constant here in Australia, and again, as I was saying, It's happening a lot along the East Coast, which is where they're planning these smart cities.
[01:04:18.589 --> 01:04:23.752]  So, you know, weather warfare is a huge part of the New World Over Global Takeover.
[01:04:23.792 --> 01:04:29.715]  They are engaging in weather warfare and testing it in Australia, as they do with everything else.
[01:04:29.775 --> 01:04:41.860]   But I think, you know, what you're seeing here and the destruction of the East Coast, Is what you'll see everywhere if they succeed.
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:49.223]  And this is why it is so important, as you said, Red, to keep educating people because people need to understand what's happening here.
[01:04:49.243 --> 01:04:53.185]  It is a complete war on every aspect of your life.
[01:04:53.265 --> 01:04:53.865]  And you're right.
[01:04:54.165 --> 01:04:59.247]  We may not have enough insects left because all of a sudden bees are in trouble here in Australia.
[01:04:59.267 --> 01:05:00.107]  We need the bees.
[01:05:00.508 --> 01:05:01.168]  What's killing them?
[01:05:01.208 --> 01:05:03.989]  Well, it's probably everything that they're spraying in the skies.
[01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:05.430]  So you're absolutely right, Red.
[01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:06.410]  We need to put a stop to this.
[01:05:07.785 --> 01:05:08.405]  We'll do it.
[01:05:08.705 --> 01:05:09.246]  We'll do it.
[01:05:09.326 --> 01:05:10.106]  Get our name out.
[01:05:10.186 --> 01:05:10.986]  Bo Scout Rev.
[01:05:11.046 --> 01:05:12.227]  We're not QAnon.
[01:05:12.487 --> 01:05:14.507]  We're the real thing at the top of the Pentagon.
[01:05:14.547 --> 01:05:15.528]  Ground the tankers.
[01:05:15.788 --> 01:05:16.968]  That's our call.
[01:05:17.288 --> 01:05:18.769]  VultureSquadron.com.
[01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:20.870]  GeoengineeringWatch.org.
[01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:23.070]  Get going on this.
[01:05:23.571 --> 01:05:24.991]  I don't know how much we can save.
[01:05:25.011 --> 01:05:29.713]  It's the patients at what they call Stage 4 critical.
[01:05:30.113 --> 01:05:31.153]  That's where it is now.
[01:05:31.333 --> 01:05:32.274]  We're the doctors.
[01:05:32.394 --> 01:05:33.654]  We read the x-rays.
[01:05:33.914 --> 01:05:35.855]  And it's Stage 4 plus.
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:39.778]   I don't know how much we're gonna have to operate, but we gotta move fast.
[01:05:39.778 --> 01:05:44.599]   Cuz I don't figure 2030 is even attainable the way it's going.
[01:05:44.599 --> 01:05:47.619]  Somebody back in 2018, she was a hero.
[01:05:47.619 --> 01:05:50.220]  She said, hey, you only got 12 years left.
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:54.259]   She didn't know how right she was, but she wasn't gonna stop it.
[01:05:54.259 --> 01:05:56.019]  And she went into Congress.
[01:05:56.034 --> 01:05:56.994]  You're not wrong, Red.
[01:05:57.014 --> 01:06:02.279]  You're not wrong that we are the doctors of today, that we are, you know, the scientists of today.
[01:06:02.419 --> 01:06:11.286]  I can't even begin to explain how much I've had to learn about law and science and the body and health and vaccines.
[01:06:11.346 --> 01:06:31.299]   I mean, I feel like I could recite You know, most of what people like Dr. McCullough say because we've just absorbed that much knowledge over the past couple of years that's really, you know, helped us because it's so crucial to arm yourself with knowledge and this is why people like you, Red, and everyone that's tuning in to this broadcast today and other days is so important.
[01:06:31.679 --> 01:06:42.369]   It's so crucial to be armed with that knowledge because, again, you can't fight against something Unless you know what you're fighting against and that's the whole point here.
[01:06:42.769 --> 01:06:45.810]  So thank you so much, Red, for sharing this information.
[01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:47.851]  Please do keep sharing this broadcast.
[01:06:48.151 --> 01:06:51.211]  Keep educating those around you and stay strong, Red.
[01:06:54.732 --> 01:07:06.527]   One thing that I'm so encouraged by is, you know, when I get to speak to people and hear how awake they are, And hear just how much they realize that the government can't be trusted.
[01:07:06.567 --> 01:07:07.267]  It's really interesting.
[01:07:07.288 --> 01:07:12.933]  I interviewed Pastor Polosky from Canada recently and he said to me, you know, I come from communism.
[01:07:13.353 --> 01:07:14.714]  I saw this a mile away.
[01:07:14.734 --> 01:07:16.816]  I knew exactly what this was.
[01:07:17.457 --> 01:07:27.206]  And for all of those who didn't grow up in communism or have family that grew up in communism, they're starting to learn exactly what communism looks like right now.
[01:07:28.001 --> 01:07:29.884]  We'll be back right after this short break.
[01:07:29.904 --> 01:07:31.467]  We'll take some more calls from people.
[01:07:31.487 --> 01:07:33.009]  We've got quite a few calls coming through.
[01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:34.111]  We're going to power through them.
[01:07:34.451 --> 01:07:39.219]  I really want to take your questions about Australia and connect with the viewers.
[01:07:39.099 --> 01:07:53.259]  So we'll see you right after this short break.
[01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:55.880]  I'm your host, Maria Z. We're taking calls now.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:02.061]  We've got Matt in New York talking about vaccines, Neuralink and nanotechnology.
[01:08:02.101 --> 01:08:02.882]  Matt, you're on the air.
[01:08:04.662 --> 01:08:06.983]  Great, how's everything?
[01:08:07.263 --> 01:08:12.204]  I would just like to say that this is just the first phase of the test.
[01:08:12.584 --> 01:08:19.942]   If you just go by what they did with the, like you said before, with the lab rats, The first phase is putting the graphene oxide inside them.
[01:08:20.482 --> 01:08:22.444]  The second phase is going to be the Neuralink.
[01:08:23.004 --> 01:08:34.295]  It's going to be put a microchip in everyone's head because it's going to be under the guise to save you, because in order to stop this stuff from keep assembling and growing inside your body, it's pretty much going to be the only option.
[01:08:34.855 --> 01:08:38.479]  It's to put a Neuralink in your head and run a current through you to control the graphene oxide.
[01:08:39.099 --> 01:08:45.217]   Well, to try to control it, because in the lab studies with the rats, You're absolutely right, Matt.
[01:08:45.257 --> 01:08:45.757]  You're right.
[01:08:45.657 --> 01:08:49.217]   inside them, which is highly toxic, leaks into all the organs,
[01:08:49.217 --> 01:08:51.817]  will kill you eventually just from the toxicity.
[01:08:51.817 --> 01:08:59.856]   But by putting a transmitter inside them, a neural link or a microchip and running a current through,
[01:08:59.856 --> 01:09:05.817]   they were able to control their thoughts, their emotions, and even direct them to a mate.
[01:09:05.817 --> 01:09:07.577]   So they're really gonna- - You're absolutely right, Matt.
[01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:08.417]  You're right.
[01:09:08.417 --> 01:09:12.957]   And I wanna comment here because they say everything that they do,
[01:09:12.957 --> 01:09:17.436]   they present to you as a solution or something positive, but it's actually linking back
[01:09:17.436 --> 01:09:20.717]  to their complete plan for control, like you said.
[01:09:21.385 --> 01:09:37.173]  You know, it'll be something that, I mean, they've spoken about the fact that people who are paralysed, for example, will be able to, you know, have more movement through this Neuralink and it'll really help people and it's presented as positive technology, but it's all got an evil undertone.
[01:09:37.193 --> 01:09:39.994]  That is correct, yeah.
[01:09:40.034 --> 01:09:46.732]   The ultimate thing is You know, just to experiment on us and complete control, complete domination.
[01:09:47.152 --> 01:09:49.853]  And one more quick thing, Marie.
[01:09:49.893 --> 01:09:50.993]  Sure.
[01:09:51.093 --> 01:09:52.094]  With viruses, right?
[01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:57.835]  Just to prove that viruses really don't exist and it's just us getting, you know, just shedding toxins.
[01:09:59.136 --> 01:10:08.139]  If viruses really did exist the way that these evil bastards said that they did, they wouldn't have to use all this propaganda to present the idea of a virus.
[01:10:08.499 --> 01:10:11.080]  They would just release it in small areas and wipe you out.
[01:10:12.413 --> 01:10:21.938]  The whole virus thing is horse crap, in my opinion, because why would they need such propaganda to scare you into the virus, to scare you into these poisonous treatments?
[01:10:22.438 --> 01:10:33.723]  We have such a golden opportunity right now, and I love everyone, and I pray for your people, and I've cried many times watching videos of the horrible things, the atrocities, the crimes against humanity in Australia.
[01:10:34.383 --> 01:10:34.803]  Horrible.
[01:10:35.243 --> 01:10:37.084]  But we have a golden opportunity right now.
[01:10:37.404 --> 01:10:41.066]  The veil is being removed, and viruses do not exist.
[01:10:41.741 --> 01:10:43.001]  They make up viruses.
[01:10:43.042 --> 01:10:44.822]  Viruses are exactly what they say.
[01:10:46.083 --> 01:10:54.946]  I think you're right, Matt, in the regard that a lot of effort is going right now to expose that everything that we knew about viruses isn't the case.
[01:10:55.426 --> 01:11:00.768]   Dr. Mike Yeadon has come out recently and said Respiratory viruses, as we know them, don't exist.
[01:11:00.848 --> 01:11:03.189]  So there's a lot of effort going into exposing this right now.
[01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:05.690]  We really appreciate your prayers here in Australia, Matt.
[01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:06.111]  Thank you.
[01:11:06.151 --> 01:11:06.751]  God bless you.
[01:11:07.071 --> 01:11:09.272]  We'll go to Ventura in California.
[01:11:09.332 --> 01:11:15.535]  And if we do miss any callers, Owen Shroyer will be taking over after this broadcast for Sunday Night Live.
[01:11:15.575 --> 01:11:17.716]  So he will continue taking some live calls.
[01:11:18.036 --> 01:11:19.717]  But Ventura, are you with us?
[01:11:21.237 --> 01:11:21.578]  Hello.
[01:11:22.138 --> 01:11:23.358]  I want to... I have a question.
[01:11:23.378 --> 01:11:26.180]  Do they have drag queen story times in classes?
[01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:36.517]  They definitely are pushing the kids to take the injections, although not by force here in Australia.
[01:11:36.557 --> 01:11:39.719]  But Drag Queen Storytime, it's been slow on the uptake.
[01:11:39.779 --> 01:11:41.601]  Australia's a bit more conservative in that regard.
[01:11:41.901 --> 01:11:49.828]  We do have an upcoming Bestiality Talk at an Australian festival, which, you know, a Sydney festival has ignited uproar.
[01:11:50.628 --> 01:11:59.530]  Where they're talking about exploring the ethics of bestiality, describing engaging with animals as one of society's last taboos.
[01:11:59.790 --> 01:12:04.472]  We saw the recent protests in Germany advocating for being able to have sex with your pets.
[01:12:04.512 --> 01:12:06.892]  Sorry to be disgusting, but this is what these people are doing.
[01:12:06.972 --> 01:12:08.833]  It is disgusting.
[01:12:08.853 --> 01:12:11.313]  They're trying to demoralize society and do all of that.
[01:12:11.333 --> 01:12:13.514]  So that sort of stuff is seeping into our country.
[01:12:14.334 --> 01:12:18.278]  But thankfully, no mandated injections for the children here.
[01:12:18.298 --> 01:12:26.345]  But we watch the United States closely, Ventura, and we just can't believe that, you know, Philadelphia masking your kids indefinitely.
[01:12:26.385 --> 01:12:27.046]  It's unbelievable.
[01:12:28.107 --> 01:12:30.789]  I mean, they're just, they're indoctrinating the children.
[01:12:30.889 --> 01:12:33.452]  And it's gross what we're seeing here, especially in America.
[01:12:33.492 --> 01:12:38.116]  I mean, America is where the big spot is, and it's just, it's horrible.
[01:12:38.216 --> 01:12:39.377]  Here, I live in California.
[01:12:40.023 --> 01:12:42.565]  You can barely even afford to pay your rent nowadays, folks.
[01:12:42.605 --> 01:12:57.516]  I mean, it is ridiculous on what's happening today, but I want you to get to other calls, but I have a question if it's possible that I can talk to the crew about getting a banned out video account or something, because I've been, I'm a conservative talk show host and I've been banned off everything, every social media.
[01:12:58.837 --> 01:13:02.179]  Sure, well, I'm sure the crew can chat to you after this call, Ventura.
[01:13:02.219 --> 01:13:03.260]  We appreciate your time.
[01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:06.162]  Kyle, sorry, Rachel in Missouri.
[01:13:06.222 --> 01:13:07.243]  Let's talk to Rachel.
[01:13:07.603 --> 01:13:08.344]  Rachel, you're on the air.
[01:13:09.554 --> 01:13:10.415]  Hi, Maria.
[01:13:10.595 --> 01:13:18.039]  It's so nice to see you here on Sunday because I saw you last week with Alex, and I'm so glad to see that you're hosting today.
[01:13:18.339 --> 01:13:19.940]  So, really great to see you.
[01:13:20.541 --> 01:13:32.428]  And the question I wanted to go ahead and ask you is, today I just saw an article here concerning energy emergencies declared after a BP refinery fire in Indiana.
[01:13:32.948 --> 01:13:35.169]  So, we have the U.S.
[01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:39.904]   Department of Transportation declared a regional emergency for Illinois, Indiana,
[01:13:39.904 --> 01:13:48.625]   Michigan, and Wisconsin after a fire shut down the BP oil refinery in some city in Indiana.
[01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:55.626]   And I was wondering, in Australia, when things were coming down, when you saw that there
[01:13:55.626 --> 01:14:02.305]   was enormous overreach, did these type of events take place there as well?
[01:14:02.305 --> 01:14:03.826]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:14:03.818 --> 01:14:15.782]  But part of the supply chain reason, they're actually using China's zero COVID policy to blame for our supply chain problems right now because we can't get stuff in from China.
[01:14:16.042 --> 01:14:25.929]   And of course, we outsourced all of our manufacturing To other countries or from other countries, you know, some time ago, we barely do any of our own manufacturing here anymore.
[01:14:25.949 --> 01:14:27.350]  We depend heavily on China.
[01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:32.154]  And of course, that's being used as the excuse for supply chain shortages.
[01:14:32.174 --> 01:14:38.120]  We've also got destruction of, we saw over a ton of avocados disposed.
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:40.602]  They're telling us that eggs are going to be in shortage.
[01:14:41.022 --> 01:14:45.904]  Chicken, poultry, you know, they're threatening us with foot and mouth disease.
[01:14:46.164 --> 01:14:56.107]  This is, of course, in order to vaccinate the cows with mRNA vaccines, even though we've got a stockpile of the traditional vaccines that we use for foot and mouth in the UK.
[01:14:56.487 --> 01:15:08.464]   So, you know, what it is, Rachel, it really is the same Goal in every country, but different tactics being deployed to reach that goal.
[01:15:09.164 --> 01:15:10.044]  So that's what we're seeing.
[01:15:10.064 --> 01:15:12.345]  But prayers are with you and your people.
[01:15:12.406 --> 01:15:13.846]  And thank you so much for calling in today.
[01:15:13.886 --> 01:15:17.348]  We've got Grant in, oh no, sorry, Kyle in New York.
[01:15:17.468 --> 01:15:18.308]  Kyle, you're on the air.
[01:15:19.769 --> 01:15:20.569]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:15:20.589 --> 01:15:21.249]  How are you today?
[01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:23.070]  Doing well, Kyle.
[01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:23.511]  How are you?
[01:15:24.411 --> 01:15:25.211]  I'm good, thanks.
[01:15:25.251 --> 01:15:30.234]  I just wanted to, first of all, thank you for covering this subject because it is a very important one.
[01:15:31.604 --> 01:15:34.545]  The world that we know it has ended, and that was in 2020.
[01:15:34.805 --> 01:15:38.307]  And I think that that's fair for everybody to acknowledge.
[01:15:38.727 --> 01:15:43.269]  Now with that said, they've preconditioned everybody through entertainment.
[01:15:44.009 --> 01:15:46.711]  They're using it in movies.
[01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:53.634]  There's a movie called Songbird, and I recommend you specifically, if you haven't seen the trailer, go watch the trailer.
[01:15:54.274 --> 01:16:02.285]   Everything from the Peloton bike to double masking to Uh, the drones that you talk about, it's all in that trailer.
[01:16:02.786 --> 01:16:05.727]  Quarantine camps, facilities, it's all there.
[01:16:06.207 --> 01:16:06.988]  I don't know if you've seen it.
[01:16:07.048 --> 01:16:08.048]  Have you, have you heard of this?
[01:16:09.089 --> 01:16:09.489]  I haven't.
[01:16:10.489 --> 01:16:15.752]  Yeah, so I would recommend, you know, when you're, when you're done with the broadcast, check that out because they really talk about it there.
[01:16:15.792 --> 01:16:19.754]  Now, there was an interesting thing as far as like these smart cities that you were talking about.
[01:16:20.154 --> 01:16:24.556]  Greg Reese had a report where he says that this is self-assembling nanotech.
[01:16:25.393 --> 01:16:38.275]  And what happens from what I've read also is that the more this assembles in your body, the higher the, I don't know if it's the hertz or whatever it's called, it goes up more and more.
[01:16:38.775 --> 01:16:40.156]  They're going to be able to track you this way.
[01:16:40.176 --> 01:16:47.437]  They're going to put you in those smart cities like they're doing over in, what is it, Saudi Arabia that wants to build a smart city?
[01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:50.238]  There is one that wants to build this really long- Yes, the lawn.
[01:16:50.258 --> 01:16:51.198]  The lawn.
[01:16:51.218 --> 01:16:52.218]  Yes, the lawn.
[01:16:52.878 --> 01:16:54.238]  They're going to put you all in there.
[01:16:54.318 --> 01:16:55.919]  They're going to try to put everybody in here.
[01:16:55.959 --> 01:17:03.201]  The next conversation that needs to be had after everybody watches Songbird is, what do you do to not be a part of that?
[01:17:03.241 --> 01:17:04.482]  Well, don't take the vaccine.
[01:17:04.502 --> 01:17:07.122]  You're going to have to get out to nature at a certain point.
[01:17:07.142 --> 01:17:08.643]  You're going to have to have a duck out bag.
[01:17:08.663 --> 01:17:10.843]  You're going to have to get away from cities.
[01:17:11.544 --> 01:17:17.197]   All of this smartphone technology, all of this smart furniture stuff, Even the cars.
[01:17:17.417 --> 01:17:18.918]  You're going to want to get older cars probably.
[01:17:18.938 --> 01:17:23.543]  Kyle, we've got about 15 seconds left until we go to break, but everything you're saying is so crucial.
[01:17:23.563 --> 01:17:26.506]  I'm going to offer some commentary right after we come out from the break.
[01:17:26.886 --> 01:17:28.008]  We need to be independent.
[01:17:28.308 --> 01:17:29.149]  We need to unplug.
[01:17:29.169 --> 01:17:31.211]  This is complete global control.
[01:17:31.571 --> 01:17:32.232]  We'll be back shortly.
[01:17:36.564 --> 01:17:39.267]  Back to the Alex Jones Show this Sunday.
[01:17:39.307 --> 01:17:40.388]  We're taking live calls.
[01:17:40.448 --> 01:17:43.131]  I just want to comment on what Kyle, the last caller, was saying.
[01:17:43.171 --> 01:17:44.272]  He's absolutely correct.
[01:17:44.572 --> 01:17:48.897]  You know, the whole success of this system depends on us being plugged in.
[01:17:49.598 --> 01:17:57.886]  The nanotech plays a huge part in that and of course, you know, the frequencies that they'll be emitting will be intricately linked with the nanotech that's now inside of people.
[01:17:58.627 --> 01:17:59.448]  So much evidence.
[01:17:59.488 --> 01:18:03.090]  I had a group of Australian whistleblower scientists that approached me.
[01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:05.151]  That interview's up on zmedia.com.
[01:18:05.311 --> 01:18:07.212]  Z-E-E-E-media.com.
[01:18:07.232 --> 01:18:08.033]  You can watch that.
[01:18:08.373 --> 01:18:11.374]  And I mean, there's so much evidence across the world from scientists.
[01:18:11.414 --> 01:18:13.115]  German scientists are talking about it.
[01:18:13.676 --> 01:18:18.058]  And it's basically undeniable now that they have done this to people.
[01:18:18.078 --> 01:18:32.107]   There's no other way that people would have accepted being tracked and traced in this manner or essentially microchipped without the threat of a public health We've got Grant in Australia calling in.
[01:18:32.147 --> 01:18:34.449]  I thought I might get a fellow Aussie on.
[01:18:34.509 --> 01:18:35.430]  Grant, you're on the air.
[01:18:36.771 --> 01:18:37.311]  Hi, Maria.
[01:18:37.351 --> 01:18:38.452]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:18:39.593 --> 01:18:40.153]  You're welcome.
[01:18:41.514 --> 01:18:48.159]  I thought I'd better stump up and, you know, part of, you know, turning up half the battle.
[01:18:48.339 --> 01:18:51.501]  So winners never quit and quitters never win.
[01:18:52.142 --> 01:18:52.582]  Absolutely.
[01:18:54.494 --> 01:18:59.417]  What I've rung in about, you're talking about the East Coast infrastructure, so I'll try to make this quick.
[01:19:00.958 --> 01:19:07.261]  Rainbow Flat on the Mid North Coast received the first NBN connection in the NBN rollout.
[01:19:08.242 --> 01:19:21.549]  And there's residents at Rainbow Flat who the rail system that you've discussed is coming through Rainbow Flat and it's a tiny little sleepy little place, all rural houses.
[01:19:22.973 --> 01:19:26.976]  Yeah, so that's the first thing I wanted to let you know about.
[01:19:27.337 --> 01:19:29.078]  That was the first NBN connection there.
[01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:31.941]  I've got an IT mate who knows about these things.
[01:19:33.382 --> 01:19:36.886]  And then there's signs on the mid-north coast about water continuity.
[01:19:37.406 --> 01:19:49.770]   They've been doing a lot of infrastructure to make sure there's water and I'm like, I've noticed them a few years back and I'm like, but if there's going to be not many people, they've got these signs everywhere for this water.
[01:19:50.490 --> 01:19:58.635]  And they built a dam on the mid-north coast and they somehow conveniently forgot to install the critical pipes for this dam.
[01:19:58.995 --> 01:20:02.357]  So they've built a dam and, you know, it can't be used.
[01:20:03.956 --> 01:20:05.318]  That's right, Grant.
[01:20:05.398 --> 01:20:10.845]  Everything that they're setting up, and I commend you for looking further into these things.
[01:20:10.885 --> 01:20:11.846]  People really need to.
[01:20:11.926 --> 01:20:20.517]  Everything that they're setting up, including the legislation that was passed right under our noses while we were being terrorised by our insane, psychopathic government.
[01:20:20.897 --> 01:20:21.357]  Yeah, hey Marie.
[01:20:21.217 --> 01:20:25.537]   is setting up the infrastructure for these smart cities for what they want to do.
[01:20:25.537 --> 01:20:29.297]   Again, referencing the Jay Dyer presentation from the other day, whoever hasn't seen it,
[01:20:29.297 --> 01:20:34.257]   I encourage that you watch it because by 2050 we're talking about complete global enslavement.
[01:20:34.257 --> 01:20:40.576]   Thanks so much for calling in Grant so early on a Monday morning. We'll go to Andy in Maine
[01:20:40.576 --> 01:20:43.416]  talking about do Australians know what's going on in the US.
[01:20:43.416 --> 01:20:43.857]  Andy.
[01:20:45.537 --> 01:20:54.097]   Yeah. Hey, Marie. G'day. So I have a ton of friends in Australia I speak to on a daily basis,
[01:20:54.097 --> 01:20:58.737]   and they think I'm crazy when I tell them about what's going on in the States.
[01:20:58.737 --> 01:21:02.195]   They- They literally have no idea.
[01:21:02.215 --> 01:21:11.859]  I mean, whatever the issue is, whether it's abortion or vaccines or any of it, gun control, they have zero idea.
[01:21:12.419 --> 01:21:15.981]  And it seems like they can't even get the information about it.
[01:21:16.924 --> 01:21:24.972]  I'm trying to inform them as best possible, but is there any way other than word of mouth to get word out to what's going on and give them a warning?
[01:21:25.032 --> 01:21:26.313]  Because it's coming your way.
[01:21:26.373 --> 01:21:35.782]  Like, some of this insanity, the Drag Queen Storytime thing that was brought up before, like, they literally are like, that is insane.
[01:21:35.862 --> 01:21:36.743]  That is crazy.
[01:21:36.783 --> 01:21:37.884]  They don't believe it.
[01:21:38.264 --> 01:21:49.230]   And even with Howard Springs, I had them look that up and I think it's a government website that talks about Howard Springs and they make it sound like it's a resort.
[01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:50.650]  They literally do.
[01:21:50.730 --> 01:21:57.432]  The quarantine camp they make sound like it's a resort and it's someplace that you would choose to go to even if you were vaccinated.
[01:21:57.932 --> 01:22:00.393]  It's just insane what you're not hearing about.
[01:22:00.733 --> 01:22:03.834]  Ricardo Bosi is another one, you know, and Australia One.
[01:22:04.094 --> 01:22:05.855]  They don't even know what Australia One is.
[01:22:07.492 --> 01:22:07.712]  Yeah.
[01:22:08.012 --> 01:22:11.133]  Andy, Andy, you sound like a really switched on guy.
[01:22:11.513 --> 01:22:20.976]  So Howard Springs, for anyone who's listening, is the model that was used as the quarantine, you know, the ultimate quarantine facility for all of Australia.
[01:22:20.996 --> 01:22:23.257]  I've actually got an article up on my website.
[01:22:23.297 --> 01:22:34.240]  It's called Australia under threat by their own government, something along those lines, which actually details all of the quarantine facilities that we're aware of right now with further quarantine facilities that are planned.
[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:41.664]  And so some of these quarantine facilities have been built on places where they used to dump military waste.
[01:22:41.724 --> 01:22:45.787]  It's hardly a place that you want to put people to, you know, to be healthy.
[01:22:46.087 --> 01:22:49.029]  It's not really healthy to go somewhere where they would dump waste.
[01:22:49.689 --> 01:22:58.854]  But we had an example of Hayley Hodgson who was taken to a quarantine facility because she didn't comply with home quarantine requirements.
[01:22:58.894 --> 01:23:00.475]  It was used as a form of punishment.
[01:23:00.515 --> 01:23:06.239]   We also had the military come And take people who were simply close contacts.
[01:23:06.259 --> 01:23:11.342]  They weren't positive from an Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory.
[01:23:11.382 --> 01:23:13.043]  The military came and escorted them.
[01:23:13.383 --> 01:23:20.968]  And so, you know, the propaganda that came out at the time was, oh, you know, the government, they understand the government's looking after them and this is for their health.
[01:23:21.308 --> 01:23:23.610]  Meanwhile, two of them actually escaped the facility.
[01:23:23.650 --> 01:23:26.552]  So tell me how they know it's for their health if they're trying to escape.
[01:23:26.972 --> 01:23:28.874]  No, it's absolutely not a holiday resort.
[01:23:29.094 --> 01:23:30.776]  This is going to be used for dissent.
[01:23:31.016 --> 01:23:36.120]  We see again Trudeau's, you know, internment camp for climate deniers.
[01:23:37.241 --> 01:23:39.563]  These quarantine facilities will be repurposed.
[01:23:39.583 --> 01:23:41.946]  There's a lot of information in that article that I've written.
[01:23:42.206 --> 01:23:48.952]  So I encourage anyone who wants to know more about Australia's quarantine facilities to go on to zmedia.com and check out the article section for that.
[01:23:49.312 --> 01:23:50.653]  Thanks so much, Andy, for your call.
[01:23:50.673 --> 01:23:56.838]  We'll go to Lori in Pennsylvania talking about Pfizer vaccine shedding.
[01:23:56.978 --> 01:23:58.819]  Any tips for dealing with that, Lori?
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:00.320]  Yes, hi.
[01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:04.604]  Back in 6-23-21, I gave my two neighbors a ride.
[01:24:04.644 --> 01:24:07.926]  They were both fully vaccinated with the Pfizer shots, one and two.
[01:24:08.346 --> 01:24:10.868]  The very next day, I had a massive headache.
[01:24:10.928 --> 01:24:14.303]   The bleeding out The night sweats, the diarrhea.
[01:24:15.203 --> 01:24:20.906]  For six months I had my back felt like it was on fire, like someone was holding a torch to it for the whole six months.
[01:24:20.946 --> 01:24:21.526]  That went away.
[01:24:22.186 --> 01:24:24.847]  Now here it is, it's like a little bit over 14 months.
[01:24:25.487 --> 01:24:29.149]  I'm still having massive chronic headaches on the top of my head and the back of my head.
[01:24:29.169 --> 01:24:31.690]  And my period is still never the same.
[01:24:31.890 --> 01:24:33.491]  I get two sometimes in a month.
[01:24:34.071 --> 01:24:36.332]  I do get those jelly-like clots that we all see.
[01:24:36.352 --> 01:24:41.254]  And I was wondering, what exactly did I inhale from the Pfizer shots?
[01:24:42.236 --> 01:24:43.957]  And I've been trying everything.
[01:24:43.997 --> 01:24:45.098]  I tried ivermectin.
[01:24:45.158 --> 01:24:45.979]  I tried everything.
[01:24:45.999 --> 01:24:49.882]  I even, the Spanish researchers, how they get the graphene oxide.
[01:24:49.922 --> 01:24:51.003]  I did all those supplements.
[01:24:51.443 --> 01:24:56.087]  I am a little bit less manic than what I was, you know, about a year ago.
[01:24:56.167 --> 01:24:59.669]  I'm less manic, but I'm still a little bit manic, but not as bad.
[01:24:59.689 --> 01:25:05.714]  I mean, this shedding is really real, and it's really serious, and there's a lot of people out there suffering like me.
[01:25:07.552 --> 01:25:12.928]  I was wondering, I know you know a lot about this stuff, and if you can help me anymore, is this ever going to go away?
[01:25:12.948 --> 01:25:14.573]  Is it going to eventually kill me, or what?
[01:25:16.371 --> 01:25:24.457]  Well Laurie, first and foremost I'm so sorry to hear about this and I know that you're not alone because so many people across the world are talking about a similar thing.
[01:25:24.477 --> 01:25:34.465]  You know, we went to such an effort to stay away from these injections and yet just simply being exposed to people who've been injected has resulted in some side effects for people.
[01:25:34.525 --> 01:25:37.968]  So that's absolutely devastating to hear that that's happening to you.
[01:25:38.488 --> 01:25:42.910]  In terms of the research that's happening, I've spoken to a lot of different doctors that are looking into this.
[01:25:42.990 --> 01:25:44.951]  I know that there is more research happening.
[01:25:45.231 --> 01:25:51.474]  The World Council for Health has published a free spike protein detox on their website.
[01:25:51.774 --> 01:25:53.695]  I've posted it in my telegram before.
[01:25:53.735 --> 01:25:54.576]  That's just Zmedia.
[01:25:54.616 --> 01:25:58.998]  You can go in and search for World Council for Health detox if you can't find it on their website.
[01:25:59.438 --> 01:26:01.180]  Again, it's a free detox guide.
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:08.007]  I can't guarantee that this is going to help, but a lot of people have reported that after doing that detox that they do feel better.
[01:26:08.687 --> 01:26:13.953]  You've said already that you've taken some supplements and that they have helped somewhat.
[01:26:14.253 --> 01:26:17.376]  The more that you can do to detox yourself right now, the better.
[01:26:17.696 --> 01:26:24.162]   But in the meantime, Laurie, just take comfort in the fact that there is definitely more research going Towards this.
[01:26:24.202 --> 01:26:29.243]  The FLCCC has also published a vaccine injury guide.
[01:26:29.703 --> 01:26:41.585]  So whilst you haven't had the injection yourself, that injury guide, you know, that protocol, that treatment by Dr. Pierre Cory and a few others may actually be helpful to you.
[01:26:41.625 --> 01:26:46.126]  And so anyone who's listening, who's experiencing those symptoms, please do go and look at those resources.
[01:26:46.166 --> 01:26:54.550]   Again, that's the World Council for Health Spike Protein Detox Guide And the FLCCC website as well for the protocol.
[01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:57.352]  I'm just aware that we've got about a minute left of today.
[01:26:57.392 --> 01:26:59.854]  We do have more callers in the queue.
[01:27:00.395 --> 01:27:06.759]  Owen Troyer will be taking over for Sunday Night Live, so he will continue taking live calls.
[01:27:10.422 --> 01:27:14.325]  I really feel for people, I really do, because people went to such an effort.
[01:27:14.958 --> 01:27:19.722]  To avoid being poisoned by these deadly shots.
[01:27:19.782 --> 01:27:26.386]  They knew what they were and yet people are still experiencing this and it is such a criminal thing.
[01:27:26.487 --> 01:27:32.047]   It is such a criminal thing that people are suffering as a result of this when they lost
[01:27:32.047 --> 01:27:37.246]  so much to stay away from these deadly, harmful injections.
[01:27:37.246 --> 01:27:39.166]  And so my heart goes out to humanity.
[01:27:39.166 --> 01:27:42.966]  But again, this is why independent media is so crucial.
[01:27:42.966 --> 01:27:48.346]   This is why you need to keep supporting this broadcast and others.
[01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:52.127]  So thank you so much to everyone for tuning in today.
[01:27:52.127 --> 01:27:53.365]  God bless you all.
[01:27:53.365 --> 01:27:56.287]  Owen Schroer taking over the calls very, very soon.
[01:27:56.287 --> 01:28:11.926]  Thank you.
[01:28:11.954 --> 01:28:15.775]  That's why I said, yeah, go to Infowarshore.com, get the book, it starts shipping in a couple weeks.
[01:28:15.875 --> 01:28:25.317]  The Great Reset and the War for the World, but I said go to Amazon, because it's the number one book chart in the world, and if it goes to number one, not of political, not of history, not of U.S.
[01:28:25.337 --> 01:28:27.598]  history, it's already number one over 40 categories.
[01:28:27.918 --> 01:28:29.439]  Like political science, you name it.
[01:28:29.459 --> 01:28:31.139]  40 plus categories is number one.
[01:28:31.379 --> 01:28:34.801]  Ladies and gentlemen, drumroll please.
[01:28:35.121 --> 01:28:39.323]  Of books in the world, The Great Reset and the War for the World is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[01:28:39.983 --> 01:28:47.862]   three four five six seven eight nine we are now number nine in the world this is
[01:28:48.747 --> 01:28:49.908]  This is political.
[01:28:50.008 --> 01:28:51.489]  This could fund our war chest.
[01:28:51.509 --> 01:28:54.631]  Just go to Amazon.com, everybody, and buy 10 copies.
[01:28:54.891 --> 01:29:00.995]  Send this blueprint to the Death Star and the New World Order, because you read this, you know their whole plan how to stop them.
[01:29:01.055 --> 01:29:02.816]  Get The Great Reset, The War for the World, now.
[01:29:02.936 --> 01:29:03.996]  It's gonna go to number one.
[01:29:04.036 --> 01:29:04.697]  What do you make of that?
