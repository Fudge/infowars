[00:00.000 --> 00:29.720]  So what are they going to do they're gonna attack a minority church or college or grocery
[00:29.720 --> 00:35.040]  store some type of minority gathering or a massive white supremacist attack they stage
[00:35.040 --> 00:39.640]  that's all the pre-programming in the media so you know what you're gonna be bad because
[00:39.640 --> 00:44.960]  you were a republican voter period that's how they intend to do this is connect the
[00:44.960 --> 00:48.960]  republican party to white supremacism and the second amendment to it that they're pushing
[00:48.960 --> 00:53.840]  for violence and preparing real false flags not just guys dressed up like white nationalists
[00:53.840 --> 00:58.200]  to discredit the republican gubernatorial candidate in Virginia but in violence my friends
[00:58.200 --> 01:03.600]  and that's so if you go to a black church or you go to a you know rural say black grocery
[01:03.600 --> 01:14.960]  store you better be packing you better be watching because let me tell you the false flags are
[01:14.960 --> 01:21.600]  coming you have seen all the massive pre-programming you've seen the democratic party in the deep
[01:21.600 --> 01:26.800]  state running on the fact that the american people that don't want to destroy their country
[01:26.800 --> 01:30.520]  that don't want election fraud that don't want open borders that don't want lockdowns
[01:30.520 --> 01:36.440]  are white supremacists with a hundred and seventy seven days out from the election coming
[01:36.440 --> 01:42.200]  up in the second hour we're gonna air excerpts from the last year and a half where I specifically
[01:42.200 --> 01:48.440]  laid out that in cell white supremacist would attack black grocery stores churches colleges
[01:48.440 --> 01:52.880]  and other facilities as a pretext to get americans killing each other and each other's
[01:52.880 --> 01:58.200]  throats right before they plunge the dollar and bring in new lockdowns and steal the
[01:58.200 --> 02:04.760]  next election in a hundred and seventy seven days the feds had red flagged people had called
[02:04.760 --> 02:09.480]  and said he's gonna attack and kill people he said he is he had a manifesto but nothing
[02:09.480 --> 02:16.200]  was done and now we're told all of talk radio has to pay now we're told that everybody's
[02:16.200 --> 02:19.960]  free speech has to pay and then it's Tucker Carlson's fault and in less than three hours
[02:19.960 --> 02:24.200]  after the shooting the blood wasn't even dry they were blaming talk radio and the internet
[02:24.200 --> 02:30.600]  and free speech and everything else for what happened now am I saying that the government
[02:30.600 --> 02:34.280]  actually did this and this guy doesn't exist no I'm not saying that I'm saying the atmosphere
[02:34.280 --> 02:38.600]  of saying whites to the devil and then whites being racially attacked everywhere and the
[02:38.600 --> 02:42.400]  media hyping it up saying we should exterminate all the white people in the new york times
[02:42.400 --> 02:47.160]  is the left trying to get black and white people and others to kill each other and distract
[02:47.160 --> 02:52.240]  from what's happening because they statistically through criminology know that the FBI does
[02:52.240 --> 02:58.280]  that if the media hypes up enough race war news and says it's imminent and there's a
[02:58.280 --> 03:03.400]  Kenosha black supremacist another crazy person runs over some innocent white people that
[03:03.400 --> 03:07.600]  whites are then gonna see that that are mentally ill and think that there's not justice and
[03:07.600 --> 03:11.880]  think the answer is going out and killing black people not seeing that it's the globalist
[03:11.880 --> 03:17.200]  playing both sides off against each other and we got to be smart enough to understand
[03:17.200 --> 03:20.440]  that those innocent white people run over and killed at that parade didn't deserve what
[03:20.440 --> 03:23.200]  happened to them that guy didn't even know who they were sending with these innocent
[03:23.200 --> 03:27.200]  black people the first two he shot reportedly and we have the footage is two black women
[03:27.200 --> 03:31.160]  loading groceries in their car what the hell did they do didn't even know them and notice
[03:31.160 --> 03:35.200]  there's never an attacks on the UN or the Rockefellers or the Rothschilds or the New
[03:35.200 --> 03:39.000]  World Order and I'm not saying there should be I'm not for offensive attacks but in these
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.880]  provocateur actions like the FBI and what we saw with Governor Whitmer now a totally
[03:43.880 --> 03:49.720]  staged event with the kidnapping plot we understand that they've done this over and over and
[03:49.720 --> 03:54.520]  over again and when they actually do target themselves they make sure that it's non-fatal
[03:54.520 --> 03:58.440]  and that nobody gets killed like with Governor Whitmer but when the American people whether
[03:58.440 --> 04:02.120]  they be black white Hispanic Asian old young gay straight you name it get attacked well
[04:02.120 --> 04:07.080]  then ladies and gentlemen we're all told collectively that white people are to blame and gun owners
[04:07.080 --> 04:11.640]  are to blame for what happened here and that is a total fraud now Royce White is a former
[04:11.640 --> 04:18.520]  NBA player in a martial arts fighter as well mixed martial arts and he is really been kicking
[04:18.520 --> 04:24.480]  ass running against Ilhan Omar he is about to take over here ladies and gentlemen and

[04:36.240 --> 04:42.080]  segment hour two to play the excerpts where I predicted all this very very specifically

[07:22.440 --> 07:26.000]  guest host for the next couple of segments the next two hours it's gonna be a hell of
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.520]  a broadcast I appreciate the time a lot of things to talk about today obviously a lot
[07:31.520 --> 07:36.920]  of things to cover the buffalo shooting is is another example of the spiritual crisis
[07:36.920 --> 07:43.800]  that we face and we do face a spiritual crisis and we do face a crisis of logic and ultimately
[07:43.800 --> 07:52.280]  a crisis of leadership first and foremost I wanted to start off the broadcast by thanking
[07:52.280 --> 07:59.360]  Alex Jones and the info wars team for allowing me to share their platform Alex Jones is an
[07:59.360 --> 08:07.120]  American hero and we all owe him our deepest gratitude and our continued support you know
[08:07.120 --> 08:11.960]  I'm here in the belly of the beast Minneapolis Minnesota is the belly of the beast make
[08:11.960 --> 08:21.680]  no mistake about it and I'm running for Congress against Il Han Omar and had I ran as a Democrat
[08:21.680 --> 08:27.600]  I would have been literally crucified for even associating myself with Alex Jones had
[08:27.600 --> 08:33.000]  I hired a general consultant from the establishment Republicans I would have been persona non grata
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.960]  but this is a turn of the tide and and the turn of the tide is that people are stepping
[08:37.960 --> 08:43.840]  up around the world and communities around this country to fight back against the corruption
[08:43.840 --> 08:52.280]  in the status quo of our legacy institutions and I for one am proud to be able to guest
[08:52.280 --> 08:56.640]  host info wars to be able to know Alex Jones and to be able to stand alongside a man that
[08:56.640 --> 09:01.360]  is fought for freedom fought for the right to to speak truth to power and said things
[09:01.360 --> 09:05.440]  that were unpopular at times when he stood to lose the most so make sure that we continue
[09:05.440 --> 09:08.920]  to support Alex Jones we got a great show coming up for you today I'm going to touch
[09:08.920 --> 09:14.240]  on Roe v Wade next next segment and then we got a good friend of mine David Penn joining
[09:14.240 --> 09:18.960]  us in the in the fourth block and fifth block like Alex said he'll be rejoining the broadcast
[09:18.960 --> 09:23.400]  in the in the second hour for one of the first blocks and then I'll take the show again
[09:23.400 --> 09:28.600]  and and we're going to talk about everything from globalism and nationalism anti-Semitism
[09:28.600 --> 09:35.920]  Roe v Wade we we got a lot to cover I just want to start with the 30,000 foot view for
[09:35.920 --> 09:41.840]  this first segment and I think Alex Jones and myself and many others who have dared
[09:41.840 --> 09:49.520]  to touch the 30,000 foot view have been casted as crazies but allowed me to have my my chance
[09:49.520 --> 09:56.920]  here the battleground seems very clear to me God versus Satan first and foremost the battle
[09:56.920 --> 10:02.560]  is spiritual like I've said many times before on this show and I will continue to stress
[10:02.560 --> 10:09.520]  and what's important to realize about it being a God versus Satan kind of battle is the the
[10:09.520 --> 10:16.760]  forces at work are somewhat beyond our comprehension and it validates or justifies those of us
[10:16.760 --> 10:23.080]  that believe that the Holy Bible and that faith are the spiritual guide and in a in
[10:23.080 --> 10:28.800]  a battle that is beyond our comprehension and when I say beyond our comprehension I mean
[10:28.800 --> 10:36.360]  we have to understand that Satan is fighting on multiple fronts at once we see it with
[10:36.360 --> 10:40.800]  the Roe v Wade conversations that have broken out over the past few weeks we see it with
[10:40.800 --> 10:47.000]  the Ukraine conflict we see it with the food shortages we see it with the currency flux
[10:47.000 --> 10:52.640]  we see it with the continued conflict there and cashmere although we see it at our own
[10:52.640 --> 10:57.080]  southern border we see it in our schools in our communities with the church of LGBTQ there
[10:57.080 --> 11:04.480]  are many many fronts where Satan wants to wage war and most recently his war came to
[11:04.480 --> 11:10.120]  Buffalo New York and I want to take a moment a moment of silence for those that lost loved
[11:10.120 --> 11:20.360]  ones for those that lost their lives in Buffalo New York now you know we're going to talk
[11:20.360 --> 11:26.600]  a lot today about cultural narratives three card Montes using black white Jewish all of
[11:26.600 --> 11:37.080]  these ethnicities and and titles to stir and foment violence and first before we go there
[11:37.080 --> 11:42.160]  I want to set the stage around the geopolitical we talked about the spiritual we know their
[11:42.160 --> 11:47.480]  forces beyond our our imagination but I want to talk about the geopolitical we got a four
[11:47.480 --> 11:53.000]  player jump ball going right now and that four player jump ball is the globalists the
[11:53.000 --> 12:02.040]  free people of the world China and Russia and it's hard to say whose interests lie where
[12:02.040 --> 12:10.640]  it's hard to say who will eventually be coalesced against the free people but what I can say
[12:10.640 --> 12:18.280]  is that the free people have to understand that in the jump ball we are we are down we
[12:18.280 --> 12:23.880]  we are not in a winning position right now and much of it has to do with the fact that
[12:23.880 --> 12:32.000]  many of us have abnegated our faith in God and put our faith in man and and by putting
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.640]  our faith in man we will fail most times we have to restore our national honor and our
[12:36.640 --> 12:41.520]  sacred honor and we have to do it through American constitutional values but we also
[12:41.520 --> 12:47.080]  have to do it through faith in God so we got a four player jump ball on the international
[12:47.080 --> 12:52.480]  political scene and I want to touch on the four heralds of of New World Order if I could
[12:52.480 --> 13:00.640]  for a moment there are four clear heralds of New World Order for the globalists to finalize
[13:00.640 --> 13:08.480]  their totalitarian dystopian dreams those four heralds are famine which is currency
[13:08.480 --> 13:15.320]  collapse we see that starting to emerge plague violence and then you got all out technocracy
[13:15.320 --> 13:21.480]  and dystopia where artificial intelligence you know prosecute crimes through facial recognition
[13:21.480 --> 13:26.160]  which is already happening in China and and those are the four heralds and we have all
[13:26.160 --> 13:34.160]  four breaking out right now and in a very in a very dire way and and the most the most
[13:34.160 --> 13:42.240]  the most recent one is this buffalo mass shooting and you know ten years ago when I was drafted
[13:42.240 --> 13:48.160]  into the NBA I said mental health was going to be the greatest social issue we face now
[13:48.160 --> 13:56.280]  whether or not we believe that government agencies could be involved in using this mass shooting
[13:56.280 --> 14:02.120]  as a false flag to start a race war to foment racial division in the country is neither
[14:02.120 --> 14:12.240]  here nor there in the sense that anybody anywhere in the world that would kill unarmed innocent
[14:12.240 --> 14:20.680]  unexpecting people is doing the work of Satan despite what are the legions as they may have
[14:20.680 --> 14:28.520]  they are doing the work of Satan and we have to pray today going forward we have to pray
[14:28.520 --> 14:35.840]  for discernment we have to pray for the ability to see with clarity where the enemy wants
[14:35.840 --> 14:43.440]  to lead us and right now it appears that the enemy wants to lead us into a a cataclysm
[14:43.440 --> 14:51.080]  of violence and yes we are all shook anytime ten people lose their lives in this way but
[14:51.080 --> 14:55.920]  in the next next segment I'm going to come back with more discussion about role v way
[14:55.920 --> 15:02.360]  the sanctity of life the millions upon millions who have have and will starve over the next
[15:02.360 --> 15:09.600]  year due to these geopolitical super corporate interests and all of these things have to
[15:09.600 --> 15:13.080]  be considered and they have to be considered right now they have to be considered by people
[15:13.080 --> 15:17.200]  who are genuine leaders and we have a crisis of leadership which is why I stepped up to
[15:17.200 --> 15:24.880]  run for United States Congress against Ilhan Omar we're going to have an incredible broadcast

[20:07.120 --> 20:23.000]  Wars I'm your guest host Royce White here in the belly of the beast Minneapolis Minnesota
[20:23.000 --> 20:28.880]  and I am running for the United States Congress against Ilhan Omar in this segment I want
[20:28.880 --> 20:34.360]  to talk about Roe v. Wade we know there was a mass shooting in Buffalo we know that violence
[20:34.360 --> 20:39.040]  is going to start to break out across the world as it has for many years but now it's
[20:39.040 --> 20:45.920]  going to ramp up and I want to just say that this is an important story anytime people
[20:45.920 --> 20:50.840]  lose their lives it is an important story it is important for us to take notice is important
[20:50.840 --> 20:57.960]  for us to pray but let us not forget that the biggest decision in my lifetime by our
[20:57.960 --> 21:05.080]  government still hangs in the balance and that is the Roe v. Wade decision why some
[21:05.080 --> 21:12.200]  might ask some who are watching probably already understand this but some who will see this
[21:12.200 --> 21:18.080]  clipped up by the mainstream media as an attempt to categorize myself and Alex Jones as far
[21:18.080 --> 21:27.720]  right white supremacists even will not understand this so I'm going to try and reason any precept
[21:27.720 --> 21:35.360]  of human rights and civil rights must begin with the sanctity of life and the Democrats
[21:35.360 --> 21:43.360]  have waged a 100 and year a 160 year war on the sanctity of life and so for all the mainstream
[21:43.360 --> 21:50.680]  media's propaganda around race around black people and white people and the history of
[21:50.680 --> 21:56.520]  this country and the patriarchy and the list goes on what they failed to mention often
[21:56.520 --> 22:03.520]  is that Democrats ought to retain the right for people to own slaves in this country and
[22:03.520 --> 22:12.200]  the 1800s it was the Democrats who attempted to arbitrarily categorize people as subhuman
[22:12.200 --> 22:18.160]  today they attempt to do the same with the human fetus and I'd like to play a clip right
[22:18.160 --> 22:23.880]  now to show how this issue also intersects with the conversation of spiritual warfare
[22:23.880 --> 22:32.960]  and God versus Satan please if we can play the clip
[22:32.960 --> 22:36.880]  okay we're having a little a little technical difficulty difficulty with the clip but we'll
[22:36.880 --> 22:42.840]  find it as to get it up as soon as we can again one of the things when I want to once
[22:42.840 --> 22:49.000]  I posted this clip that I ran into was this narrative about the Democrats which and I
[22:49.000 --> 22:53.360]  want to talk about the Democrats which because it was a lie and the reason why many people
[22:53.360 --> 22:58.880]  are unable to decipher this lie is either a they've been indoctrinated and brainwashed
[22:58.880 --> 23:08.080]  by Marxist academia institutions across the country who have who have pushed this lie
[23:08.080 --> 23:13.160]  shoved this lie down the throats of students who were unbeknownst and really unable to
[23:13.160 --> 23:18.360]  defend themselves psychologically and intellectually but the truth is the truth that nobody wants
[23:18.360 --> 23:25.320]  to say because of how inconvenient it is is that we live under the thumb of a uniparty
[23:25.320 --> 23:30.760]  and we have for a very long time and one of the symbols of the Democrats which was the
[23:30.760 --> 23:36.000]  civil rights movement the civil rights act but many of us understand that in retrospect
[23:36.000 --> 23:45.440]  LBJ was in no way a friend to black people or civil rights in fact he often is understood
[23:45.440 --> 23:52.760]  to have used civil rights as a political tool as a political machine for the for the Democrats
[23:52.760 --> 23:59.160]  interest as a party and then we had Nixon who in retrospect himself and Kissinger we
[23:59.160 --> 24:07.280]  understand to have not been conservatives not been people who believed in God but Democrats
[24:07.280 --> 24:12.760]  and really they were uniparty globalists and so when people don't or aren't able to understand
[24:12.760 --> 24:20.760]  this history they throw out these these talking points like the Democrats switch the Democrats
[24:20.760 --> 24:25.800]  have never switched the Democrats fought for the right to categorize a certain group of
[24:25.800 --> 24:33.280]  people as subhuman today they want to do the same thing with fetuses and babies please
[24:33.280 --> 24:50.640]  roll the clip
[24:50.640 --> 25:09.080]  you guys help us stop fucking break it's not fucking working
[25:09.080 --> 25:20.480]  it's not fucking working, help us, help me, help me, I need to come over here let's talk
[25:20.480 --> 25:28.440]  a little bit, what's your name? Bernadette, hi Bernadette, good you're awesome, I killed
[25:28.440 --> 25:35.160]  this son why can't I, God murdered his son on that piece of shit wood, come outside, I
[25:35.160 --> 25:40.080]  brought my raiders for you to kill and you know what the fucking police this fucking
[25:40.080 --> 25:45.760]  performance is getting better, this performance is getting better, the police, come outside,
[25:45.760 --> 25:50.160]  we want to talk, we want to fucking talk, yeah, what the fuck are you talking about,
[25:50.160 --> 26:01.160]  fuck, it's a police terrorizing my mother fucking uterus mother fucker uterus
[26:01.160 --> 26:22.360]  I
[26:22.360 --> 26:27.660]  mean to understand I mean first of all
[26:27.660 --> 26:31.420]  The fact that 20 million, 20 to 30 million of the babies
[26:31.420 --> 26:36.180]  that have been aborted since Roe v. Wade went into law
[26:36.180 --> 26:40.140]  in the 1970s were black children.
[26:40.140 --> 26:45.140]  And that Planned Parenthood was explicitly, explicitly,
[26:45.740 --> 26:49.940]  explained and designated and promoted by Margaret Sanger
[26:49.940 --> 26:52.900]  to be a way to exterminate black people,
[26:52.900 --> 26:56.680]  makes this clip disturbing, most disturbing.
[26:57.900 --> 26:59.820]  And it makes it most disturbing because today,
[26:59.820 --> 27:02.980]  the liberal media, the mainstream media,
[27:02.980 --> 27:06.300]  the Anti-Defamation League will try to tell you
[27:06.300 --> 27:11.300]  that white supremacy is a foot in the form of this shooter.
[27:16.200 --> 27:19.420]  And certainly it may be, obviously it is.
[27:19.420 --> 27:23.600]  Obviously this violence is completely abhorrent.
[27:25.280 --> 27:30.280]  But the real white supremacy is to tell black people,
[27:30.520 --> 27:32.560]  to tell all people, to tell working class people,
[27:32.560 --> 27:35.720]  to tell American citizens that if you can't keep up
[27:35.720 --> 27:40.720]  with an affluent radical material lifestyle,
[27:40.960 --> 27:42.860]  then you should just kill your kids
[27:42.860 --> 27:44.540]  and that they're not kids.
[27:44.540 --> 27:47.880]  They're just clumps of sales that we can get rid of
[27:47.880 --> 27:50.300]  in our own interest.
[27:50.300 --> 27:53.940]  When civilizations, when society starts to sacrifice
[27:53.940 --> 27:58.100]  their young for their old, we are in a crisis.
[27:59.180 --> 28:04.180]  Abrahamic faith introduced and changed civilization
[28:05.120 --> 28:08.980]  in the direction where we no longer sacrifice our children.
[28:08.980 --> 28:19.980]  Again, another vindication of the Bible's wisdom, not sacrificing your children,
[28:19.980 --> 28:24.700]  separates you from the barbarity that ruled over the ancient world.
[28:26.780 --> 28:28.820]  Over the last 50 years, we've lost that.
[28:29.940 --> 28:32.860]  And this clip was a prime example that Satan is at work
[28:32.860 --> 28:37.540]  on all sides, for many angles, with many political ambitions,
[28:37.540 --> 28:39.700]  but many more spiritual ambitions.
[28:40.540 --> 28:43.180]  We're gonna come back next segment
[28:43.180 --> 28:45.260]  with a good friend of mine, David Penn,
[28:45.260 --> 28:47.380]  who is an international businessman,
[28:47.380 --> 28:49.420]  and we're gonna talk about some issues
[28:49.420 --> 28:52.920]  that may be even more touchy than abortion.
[28:52.920 --> 28:54.540]  Please stay over until the next segment.
[28:54.540 --> 28:56.840]  Thank you and for wars and thank your audience.

[30:00.020 --> 30:01.340]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[30:01.340 --> 30:03.340]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[30:03.340 --> 30:04.180]  Welcome.
[30:04.180 --> 30:05.020]  Hello, Alex.
[30:05.020 --> 30:05.860]  Yes, Malcolm.
[30:05.860 --> 30:07.540]  All right, I will make this quick and real short
[30:07.540 --> 30:09.540]  where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[30:09.540 --> 30:11.620]  Alex, I have to promote one thing
[30:11.620 --> 30:13.940]  from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[30:13.940 --> 30:16.940]  Supermal Vitality and Brainforce Plus.
[30:16.940 --> 30:19.820]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[30:19.820 --> 30:21.660]  Supermal Vitality really, really works.
[30:21.660 --> 30:24.900]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[30:24.900 --> 30:26.500]  that have never been heated up,
[30:26.500 --> 30:31.060]  and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions
[30:31.060 --> 30:33.340]  that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[30:33.340 --> 30:36.020]  This is like a very fine wine.
[30:36.020 --> 30:37.260]  In fact, each batch is different.
[30:37.260 --> 30:39.740]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[30:39.740 --> 30:41.100]  People are like, why are you selling something
[30:41.100 --> 30:43.020]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[30:43.020 --> 30:43.940]  That's just how it is.
[30:43.940 --> 30:45.540]  It's how it works.
[30:45.540 --> 30:47.220]  So it's always good.
[30:47.220 --> 30:49.340]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[30:49.340 --> 30:52.420]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price,
[30:52.420 --> 30:59.420]  then this is it.
[30:59.420 --> 31:01.420]  We have over a hundred designs and t-shirts
[31:01.420 --> 31:03.140]  that just sit there in our warehouse.
[31:03.140 --> 31:05.940]  We need to sell those shirts to fund the operation.
[31:05.940 --> 31:07.500]  But we'd already made some orders
[31:07.500 --> 31:09.020]  on future shirts coming in.
[31:09.020 --> 31:10.260]  These are all limited editions.
[31:10.260 --> 31:12.340]  So once these new shirts come in, we're going to sell those
[31:12.340 --> 31:13.180]  and that's it.
[31:13.180 --> 31:16.100]  We'll have limited editions one at a time in the future.
[31:16.100 --> 31:17.780]  When they're gone, they're gone.
[31:17.780 --> 31:19.740]  Well, here's the new limited edition shirt.
[31:19.740 --> 31:22.540]  This one is $24.95, a really nice fabric.
[31:22.540 --> 31:24.420]  Alex Jones was right on the front
[31:24.420 --> 31:27.500]  with a big red lightning bolt on the back, infowars.com.
[31:27.500 --> 31:28.580]  You talk about triggering.

[31:29.860 --> 31:31.140]  You talk about waking people up.
[31:31.140 --> 31:32.260]  Alex Jones was right.
[31:32.260 --> 31:35.100]  Fundraiser shirt, we need the funds to operate.
[31:35.100 --> 31:36.660]  Infowarsstore.com.

[33:32.300 --> 33:33.300]  I'm Alex Jones.
[33:33.300 --> 33:34.300]  I'm Alex Jones.
[33:34.300 --> 33:35.300]  I'm Alex Jones.
[33:35.300 --> 33:36.300]  I'm Alex Jones.
[33:36.300 --> 33:37.300]  I'm Alex Jones.
[33:37.300 --> 33:40.220]  I'm Alex Jones for the rest of the two-hour blockade.
[33:40.220 --> 33:43.460]  I'm here and I'm honored to be here.
[33:43.460 --> 33:45.460]  Thank you to Alex Jones and the info wars team
[33:45.460 --> 33:48.420]  for allowing me this platform.
[33:48.420 --> 33:50.380]  We're talking about Roe v. Wait.
[33:50.380 --> 33:53.500]  And we're going to get David Pinn in here as soon as possible.
[33:53.500 --> 33:57.620]  But Roe v. wait is the issue.
[33:57.620 --> 34:00.580]  It's not just another political issue.
[34:00.580 --> 34:03.140]  It's the issue.
[34:03.140 --> 34:08.460]  nation, communities without the sanctity of life.
[34:08.460 --> 34:16.500]  And what dawned on me the other day is not only around the hidden racism of the liberal,
[34:16.500 --> 34:22.220]  globalist, anti-human movement, but also the military interests.
[34:22.220 --> 34:25.580]  And we have a war right now that's breaking out between Russia and Ukraine, or already
[34:25.580 --> 34:28.140]  has broken out and we're in it.
[34:28.140 --> 34:33.340]  And there's this $40 billion bill with a bunch of phantom budget items, $190 million going
[34:33.340 --> 34:39.140]  to the CIA, $5 billion for Joe Biden to use at his discretion.
[34:39.140 --> 34:41.580]  The man can barely stay awake.
[34:41.580 --> 34:43.220]  We got big problems.
[34:43.220 --> 34:52.340]  But still the linchpin of this entire spiritual and societal decay is Roe v. Wade.
[34:52.340 --> 35:02.140]  And what dawned on me the other day is it seems that the ability to kill a human fetus,
[35:02.140 --> 35:08.900]  to kill a baby in the womb, justifies the ambition for the military-industrial complex
[35:08.900 --> 35:15.500]  to wage war and kill innocent people all across the world, right, faithless, not faithless,
[35:15.500 --> 35:18.340]  but faceless people.
[35:18.340 --> 35:23.740]  And that's what Roe v. Wade, an abortion, an abortion around the world that has reached
[35:23.740 --> 35:34.220]  30 to 40 million babies per year, $125,000 a day, that's what was ushered in by abortion
[35:34.220 --> 35:44.260]  is this dehumanization and this disconnectedness with life and death.
[35:44.260 --> 35:46.180]  And there are unintended consequences.
[35:46.180 --> 35:51.220]  There is such a thing as moral hazard around these issues.
[35:51.220 --> 35:59.260]  And one of the unintended consequences may have been that people's overall value and
[35:59.260 --> 36:05.740]  respect for human life has continued to decay over time.
[36:05.740 --> 36:06.740]  And we see that.
[36:06.740 --> 36:08.780]  I mean, we know that that's true.
[36:08.780 --> 36:10.020]  That's not a conspiracy theory.
[36:10.020 --> 36:23.260]  I mean, the progressives, there's a difference here, let me say this, that the two futures
[36:23.260 --> 36:28.820]  of American politics are nationalist populism and socialist populism.
[36:28.820 --> 36:36.420]  And the progressives, they seem to want to promote that in order for us to be humans,
[36:36.420 --> 36:40.500]  be meaningful, live meaningful lives, that we need to save the earth.
[36:40.500 --> 36:45.940]  And in order to do so, we have to eat soy or we have to kill our dogs.
[36:45.940 --> 36:47.580]  But that's not all they promote.
[36:47.580 --> 36:51.500]  They also promote that we should kill our children, that our children are not really
[36:51.500 --> 36:56.860]  children, that every baby that we've aborted is not really the future of this country.
[36:56.860 --> 36:57.860]  And I reject that.
[36:57.860 --> 37:05.020]  And I think every patriot, God-loving American listening to this broadcast should reject
[37:05.020 --> 37:06.020]  that.
[37:06.020 --> 37:12.420]  Now, should you take a weapon into a grocery store and kill unarmed people?
[37:12.420 --> 37:13.420]  Absolutely not.
[37:13.420 --> 37:16.020]  That's, there's nothing Christian about that.
[37:16.020 --> 37:18.220]  There's nothing God, Godly about that.
[37:18.220 --> 37:20.100]  That is the work of Satan.
[37:20.100 --> 37:25.660]  But we must become more politically active than we have ever been because it's very
[37:25.660 --> 37:28.820]  clear how this situation got out of hand.
[37:28.820 --> 37:34.220]  Our politics, our politicians sold us out.
[37:34.220 --> 37:37.260]  We traded our security for freedom.
[37:37.260 --> 37:40.340]  We traded our freedom for security, I'm sorry.
[37:40.340 --> 37:47.180]  We traded our freedom for a material high and in doing so, we allowed politicians to
[37:47.180 --> 37:52.460]  broker our citizenship and in doing, in, in, in, in their brokering, they have made the
[37:52.460 --> 38:00.740]  claim that a human fetus, that a child in the womb has no rights, has no citizenship.
[38:00.740 --> 38:02.900]  We must protect the citizenship of the unborn.
[38:02.900 --> 38:09.180]  Now, I want to bring in my, my guest today, David Penn, who's a friend, someone I consider
[38:09.180 --> 38:10.180]  family.
[38:10.180 --> 38:12.140]  He's an international businessman.
[38:12.140 --> 38:13.660]  He's a believer in God.
[38:13.660 --> 38:15.940]  He is somebody who is a mentor.
[38:15.940 --> 38:19.980]  He is somebody who has a very rich understanding of history.
[38:19.980 --> 38:25.020]  We have great conversations and he happens to be Jewish.
[38:25.020 --> 38:28.180]  Please, David Penn, bring David in.
[38:28.180 --> 38:36.100]  And I want to say something else before David and I start, it's, it's, it's interesting
[38:36.100 --> 38:41.940]  that today, with everything else that's going on, a culture war is going to continue to
[38:41.940 --> 38:49.340]  brew and spill over and, and the culture war around white supremacy, black people and
[38:49.340 --> 38:55.700]  racism and our history and Jewish people is a never ending three card Monty.
[38:55.700 --> 38:59.900]  I've said it before and I'll say it again.
[38:59.900 --> 39:08.020]  The black bourgeoisie, there is a, there is a secular Jewish elite that have taken advantage
[39:08.020 --> 39:12.980]  of the Jewish people in the same way that the black bourgeoisie here in America have
[39:12.980 --> 39:15.020]  taken advantage of black people.
[39:15.020 --> 39:22.100]  And there are elites of every creed, ethnicity, color, age, gender that have been predatory
[39:22.100 --> 39:25.180]  on the common folks.
[39:25.180 --> 39:28.420]  And it's interesting that, you know, here in Minneapolis, when I decided I was going
[39:28.420 --> 39:32.380]  to run against Ilhan Omar and I made that announcement, the newspaper of record, the
[39:32.380 --> 39:40.700]  Star Tribune made the claim that I was peddling anti-semitic conspiracy theories by saying
[39:40.700 --> 39:46.140]  globalists, by saying the word globalists, by talking about globalism.
[39:46.140 --> 39:50.980]  And I'm offended today because when I look out at the mainstream media and the narrative
[39:50.980 --> 39:57.740]  around this mass shooting, an idiot, an agent of Satan who decided to take people's lives
[39:57.740 --> 40:06.220]  in an act of peer violence is being associated linguistically with people like myself, Alex
[40:06.220 --> 40:11.700]  Jones, Steve Bannon and whoever else they have called anti-semitic or far right or white
[40:11.700 --> 40:12.700]  supremacists.
[40:12.700 --> 40:18.700]  I mean, the Washington Post called me a darling of the far right and I reject that and I reject
[40:18.700 --> 40:22.660]  the idea that to talk about globalism is by default anti-semitic.
[40:22.660 --> 40:30.300]  So I want to bring in David Penn, just to get our conversation started.
[40:30.300 --> 40:35.460]  You got about two minutes, yeah, good to be with you, brother, got about two minutes and
[40:35.460 --> 40:39.700]  we're going to go over into the next segment as well and continue our conversation.
[40:39.700 --> 40:46.820]  But just briefly, just briefly talk about how you heard my name initially and how we
[40:46.820 --> 40:49.060]  came into contact.
[40:49.060 --> 40:59.020]  Two minutes, two minutes, a short period of time for me to express to the audience what
[40:59.020 --> 41:04.500]  a lover of the Jewish people and a lover of Israel, Royce really is.
[41:04.500 --> 41:14.060]  And the reason I met Royce was because a local political operative contacted me and let me
[41:14.060 --> 41:20.660]  know that Royce was going to enter the race, this handler of Sister Davis was another candidate
[41:20.660 --> 41:24.460]  here for this congressional seat.
[41:24.460 --> 41:31.300]  This Matt Brotsky called me and he said Royce Davis is, Royce White is going to enter this
[41:31.300 --> 41:37.500]  campaign against Davis and don't worry about it, he's an anti-semitic.
[41:37.500 --> 41:43.020]  And as a Jewish person by birth, this was very triggering for me, so what do I do?
[41:43.020 --> 41:46.140]  I pick up the phone and I call Royce.
[41:46.140 --> 41:53.220]  And we had a wonderful conversation, the first conversation was at least three hours straight.
[41:53.220 --> 41:59.180]  And I wanted to share with the audience that after a lifetime, 62 years of being Jewish,
[41:59.180 --> 42:04.300]  Royce actually helped me understand my Jewishness better than I ever had in my life.
[42:04.300 --> 42:11.740]  So I want all the listeners and all the gawkers and watchers and haters that want to paint
[42:11.740 --> 42:21.500]  people with labels to suppress their voices, to know that this is an anti-American, anti-religious,
[42:21.500 --> 42:31.260]  anti-freedom strategy to hammer people with labels, labelings that are not accurate.
[42:31.260 --> 42:37.260]  So Royce, I really want to thank you for bringing me on here and I consider you family and I
[42:37.260 --> 42:42.180]  consider us religiously aligned and I look forward to continuing this conversation after
[42:42.180 --> 42:44.380]  the break.
[42:44.380 --> 42:49.100]  Thank you brother, we're going to be back after the break and continue the interview
[42:49.100 --> 42:50.100]  with David Penn.
[42:50.100 --> 42:54.100]  He's also going to join us in the second half of the second hour for a moment to talk about
[42:54.100 --> 42:56.140]  some broader political ideas.

[45:57.860 --> 46:06.260]  Get our great, and a bag of it here, I mean this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas,
[46:06.260 --> 46:08.140]  Mexico, the Communists?
[46:08.140 --> 46:12.860]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[46:12.860 --> 46:16.660]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee, and yeah, we buy it from the little
[46:16.660 --> 46:20.580]  farmers that, you know, the media calls Communists, but really they're just a commune, and whatever
[46:20.580 --> 46:24.140]  the point is, is that it's good coffee, and we've got it, and the farmers don't let the
[46:24.140 --> 46:27.220]  Mexican government take over, so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels, and I've
[46:27.220 --> 46:29.780]  been buying it for, what, 14 years, and the price has never gone up.
[46:29.780 --> 46:34.500]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound, and I just
[46:34.500 --> 46:36.660]  think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[46:36.660 --> 46:41.180]  Let's wake up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally, in fact, I'm
[46:41.180 --> 46:48.140]  not going to tell you a little story, yeah, I'd like to, okay, you wouldn't believe it.
[46:48.140 --> 46:53.180]  Anyway, so it's infowarsstore.com, and that's how we fund this operation, and if you don't
[46:53.180 --> 47:01.540]  fund us and don't want to see it, that's fine.
[47:01.540 --> 47:17.820]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:17.820 --> 47:22.300]  I'm back, Royce White, your guest host for infowars, for this hour and the next, I want
[47:22.300 --> 47:26.100]  to thank Alex Jones and the infowars team for allowing me this platform.
[47:26.100 --> 47:35.100]  I want to bring back in now my guests, my guest and friend, David Penn, David, I threw two
[47:35.100 --> 47:41.340]  minutes at you to try and explain a story that's long and has many details and nuances,
[47:41.340 --> 47:42.340]  but I think we're past that.
[47:42.340 --> 47:46.300]  The gist of the story is that the cultural narratives are playing out, but they're actually
[47:46.300 --> 47:51.460]  spilling over, and people like myself and David Penn, who otherwise the establishment
[47:51.460 --> 47:56.340]  and the narrative would try and keep separated, have found an opportunity to come together
[47:56.340 --> 47:59.820]  under the circumstances, the dire circumstances of our country.
[47:59.820 --> 48:04.940]  But now, David, we talked a little bit earlier today about Roe v. Wade, and I have to admit
[48:04.940 --> 48:13.540]  that you have changed my opinion about Roe v. Wade in a way that has made me feel more
[48:13.540 --> 48:20.940]  strongly about it, more convicted about the implications of Roe v. Wade, maybe than ever
[48:20.940 --> 48:21.940]  before.
[48:21.940 --> 48:23.540]  So I just want you to talk a little bit about it.
[48:23.540 --> 48:27.860]  I'm just going to kick the football to you and let you go about Roe v. Wade, the sanctity
[48:27.860 --> 48:34.940]  of life and sacred honor, and why Roe v. Wade for you as a Jewish man who believes in God
[48:34.940 --> 48:39.820]  is so offensive in the way that it's presented today and in the way that it is played out
[48:39.820 --> 48:43.220]  and carried out in our modern society.
[48:43.220 --> 48:44.220]  Have at it, brother.
[48:44.220 --> 48:53.980]  Thank you, it occurs to me that the sanctity of life issue, it has its roots back in the
[48:53.980 --> 49:03.700]  story of Abraham binding Isaac on Mount Moriah, and God letting Abraham know that child sacrifice
[49:03.700 --> 49:11.540]  or child death was no longer a requisite ritual in the Abrahamic faith.
[49:11.540 --> 49:17.220]  And the Jewish people have been on the run for a long time since the Romans destroyed
[49:17.220 --> 49:25.380]  Israel, and this anti-Semitism issue that we were discussing before the break really
[49:25.380 --> 49:35.660]  goes back to that violent end of the state of Israel, number one, at the time of Christ,
[49:35.660 --> 49:41.020]  and when the Jewish people moved throughout the world because they do keep on to themselves
[49:41.020 --> 49:48.780]  because a Jewish person, a real Jewish person, their entire life is dedicated to their relationship
[49:48.780 --> 49:50.420]  with God.
[49:50.420 --> 49:57.780]  And I think that's something that really speaks to the heart of this Roe v. Wade issue, because
[49:57.780 --> 50:06.140]  traditionally over thousands of years, this is thousands of years, the Jewish people only
[50:06.140 --> 50:12.180]  focus on their community and their community's relationship to God.
[50:12.180 --> 50:19.860]  And this went on with great, great challenge because the Jewish people had been pushed
[50:19.860 --> 50:24.820]  out of their homeland wherever they went, they were a stranger in the land because they
[50:24.820 --> 50:33.900]  kept to themselves, they had strange traditions in alien ways, they were discriminated against.
[50:33.900 --> 50:44.060]  And the high point of that discrimination came in World War II, and while we look back
[50:44.060 --> 50:49.780]  on World War II as a great victory, a great military victory, it was a phenomenal spiritual
[50:49.780 --> 50:56.820]  defeat of faith by the forces of darkness, by the forces of evil.
[50:56.820 --> 51:04.060]  Because after that war, even though it was one, 88 million people dying in five years,
[51:04.060 --> 51:10.180]  six million Jewish people dying brutally in gas chambers, marched to their deaths, and
[51:10.180 --> 51:16.420]  there was many other people that died in those gas chambers, Catholics, homosexuals, communists,
[51:16.420 --> 51:24.340]  trade unionists, the Germans were almost equal opportunity, genocidal maniacs.
[51:24.340 --> 51:32.460]  People lost their faith, they just couldn't understand after the war how a loving God
[51:32.460 --> 51:36.300]  could have lost such barbarism and butchery to take place.
[51:36.300 --> 51:43.780]  And this led to a tremendous increase in the post-modern tradition of secular humanism
[51:43.780 --> 51:49.100]  and for the Jewish people, and I'm going to get to this World Versus Wait issue because
[51:49.100 --> 51:53.060]  I think these things are related, the Jewish people made a decision, no, I'm a child of
[51:53.060 --> 51:58.980]  the 50s so I'm pretty aware of this decision, the decision was made to assimilate.
[51:58.980 --> 52:03.820]  In other words, previous to the World War II experience, Jewish people really did not
[52:03.820 --> 52:09.500]  want to assimilate and that did cause anti-Semitism.
[52:09.500 --> 52:16.380]  But when that war happened and there was such, such horror, the community in large part decided
[52:16.380 --> 52:22.820]  that joining with the culture, becoming part of the culture, was the strategy for survival,
[52:22.820 --> 52:25.220]  it was a survival strategy.
[52:25.220 --> 52:32.500]  Now we did have a large portion of the people that maintained the tradition, maybe a third
[52:32.500 --> 52:39.780]  of our population, what we call the Orthodox, but two-thirds of the population, which we
[52:39.780 --> 52:48.900]  call the conservative and reform movement, actually became homogenized with the general
[52:48.900 --> 52:50.500]  culture.
[52:50.500 --> 52:57.380]  And that meant that these very religious people now became very American people.
[52:57.380 --> 53:03.980]  And as time progressed, whether they knew it or not, the decision was made either overtly
[53:03.980 --> 53:12.740]  or tacitly, that going with the liberal tradition, much like the black community, Jews are cultural
[53:12.740 --> 53:21.140]  Democrats because the Democrats provided shelter for them, fought for them allegedly, and this
[53:21.140 --> 53:25.700]  was a home for this immigrant population to find safety.
[53:25.700 --> 53:33.020]  So it wasn't a surprise that Jewish people, for their faith, became on the front lines
[53:33.020 --> 53:44.260]  of the abortion movement, prominent Jewish attorneys were very vocal and very key in
[53:44.260 --> 53:49.220]  the litigation that led to the Roe vs. Wade decision.
[53:49.220 --> 53:56.460]  And these are cultural Jews, I have to say I don't think they're religious Jews.
[53:56.460 --> 54:03.740]  This is a great lie, if we believe in God, we cannot believe in abortion.
[54:03.740 --> 54:07.700]  And we were taught that as Jews, you can be Jewish and believe in abortion, I know Catholics
[54:07.700 --> 54:12.220]  were taught, they can believe in Catholicism and they can believe in abortion, but this
[54:12.220 --> 54:16.620]  is time, this is an offensive lie, a brainwashing of children.
[54:16.620 --> 54:23.260]  The tradition, the Judeo-Christian tradition, forbids child sacrifice and child murder.
[54:23.260 --> 54:31.660]  So this is an unambiguous issue and it's something that has really caught up a great
[54:31.660 --> 54:37.740]  part of the Jewish community, even to the point where today a big part of the cultural
[54:37.740 --> 54:46.860]  Jews are vehemently in favor of the pro-choice movement, on the front lines of the pro-choice
[54:46.860 --> 54:54.500]  movement, both as protestors and as the legal force that is seeking to maintain that.
[54:54.500 --> 55:01.580]  So my call is out to the Jewish people, to the believers, to see that they have common
[55:01.580 --> 55:07.460]  cause with the black community, with the Christian community, I think that Jewish believers know
[55:07.460 --> 55:13.180]  that, but I also want to talk to the Jewish non-believers, because there's no safety for
[55:13.180 --> 55:19.780]  them in this, because globalism and the New World Order and where this abortion predicate
[55:19.780 --> 55:28.540]  takes us, which is to the Fourth Industrial Revolution, is a very anti-human, very brutal
[55:28.540 --> 55:35.100]  reality that we're bringing upon ourselves, not the least of which is, how can a nation
[55:35.100 --> 55:40.300]  be blessed if it's engaged in the murder of children?
[55:40.300 --> 55:47.020]  And I think it's time that Americans of all stripes, all religions, all colors and creeds
[55:47.020 --> 55:53.020]  start to think about our need for faith and our need for prayer, and reach out in ourselves
[55:53.020 --> 55:59.260]  to God and become clarified of what the number one critical question is, do we believe in
[55:59.260 --> 56:02.020]  God or do we not believe in God?
[56:02.020 --> 56:06.220]  Because that's what this abortion argument really is, it's a proxy war.
[56:06.220 --> 56:11.540]  It was always a proxy war from the first day, because the believers rejected abortion
[56:11.540 --> 56:17.380]  and the non-believers accepted pro-choice as their new sacrament.
[56:17.380 --> 56:22.780]  And it's time for us, I think, as a country to talk about this and not to suppress each
[56:22.780 --> 56:32.380]  other with vile claims of anti-Semitism or racism.
[56:32.380 --> 56:38.380]  Right now, more than ever, in this time of great cultural confusion and social confusion
[56:38.380 --> 56:45.300]  and historical trauma, we need to talk to each other and not to be labelling each other
[56:45.300 --> 56:46.700]  and make eye statements.
[56:46.700 --> 56:52.500]  I believe in God, I believe in the sanctity of life, I believe in America, I believe in
[56:52.500 --> 56:58.460]  our Constitution, I believe in my brotherhood with all my fellow Americans.
[56:58.460 --> 57:02.580]  Those are the statements that I'm craving for, I'm hoping for.
[57:02.580 --> 57:07.780]  And interestingly, I hear here on info wars, no matter what.
[57:07.780 --> 57:13.540]  Those that don't listen to the show might say about it, I'm a new listener.
[57:13.540 --> 57:22.980]  And I'm very happy to hear the warm and welcoming dialogue that's really here.
[57:22.980 --> 57:23.980]  Thank you, David Penn.
[57:23.980 --> 57:31.060]  I appreciate your insight, no doubt, no doubt that the question of the day is, do we believe
[57:31.060 --> 57:32.060]  or don't we?
[57:32.060 --> 57:35.380]  Do we have sacred honor or are we without?
[57:35.380 --> 57:39.500]  David Penn elaborated something that's very important to think about from the terms of
[57:39.500 --> 57:44.220]  cultural narratives between blacks, Jews, whites, but really Americans and people who
[57:44.220 --> 57:48.100]  believe who have sacred honor and those who don't, stick with us at the second half of
[57:48.100 --> 57:49.100]  the hour.
[57:49.100 --> 57:50.100]  We'll have David Penn.
[57:50.100 --> 57:53.980]  He'll be the newest product from InfoWarsLife.com.
[57:53.980 --> 57:57.500]  We are so proud of InfoWarsLife immune support.
[57:57.500 --> 58:05.220]  It is concentrated herbs that are known on record to supercharge our body's natural defenses.
[58:05.220 --> 58:09.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is something that is essential and everyone should get.
[58:09.420 --> 58:13.180]  And on top of it, it funds the InfoWars, so that's a 360 win.
[58:13.180 --> 58:16.260]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product.
[58:16.260 --> 58:22.260]  It's elderberry, concentrated echinacea, concentrated astragalus root, angelica root,
[58:22.260 --> 58:24.700]  loatium root, and more.
[58:24.700 --> 58:26.340]  This product is incredible.
[58:26.340 --> 58:31.980]  InfoWars immune support, exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com, is funding the tip of
[58:31.980 --> 58:34.340]  the spear, the InfoWars operation.
[58:34.340 --> 58:35.700]  It is a 360 win.
[58:35.700 --> 58:40.180]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's
[58:40.180 --> 58:42.780]  natural defenses and keep InfoWars on the air.
[58:42.780 --> 58:45.220]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[58:45.220 --> 58:46.220]  Take action now.
[58:46.220 --> 58:47.220]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[58:47.220 --> 58:53.500]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand InfoWars.
[58:53.500 --> 58:57.740]  I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little
[58:57.740 --> 58:58.740]  local radio show.
[58:58.740 --> 59:02.420]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge
[59:02.420 --> 59:03.420]  the globalist.
[59:03.420 --> 59:08.660]  And it was a t-shirt I designed, the first one, mass murderers agreed gun control works
[59:08.660 --> 59:11.860]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew.
[59:11.860 --> 59:14.740]  That's our oldest design and we still sell it.
[59:14.740 --> 59:19.540]  We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions because whatever
[59:19.540 --> 59:24.620]  stock we've got in, that's it, we're selling everything out to fund the operation, to get
[59:24.620 --> 59:25.620]  rid of inventory.
[59:25.620 --> 59:29.260]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future, they'll just be limited editions and short
[59:29.260 --> 59:30.260]  runs.
[59:30.260 --> 59:33.700]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance on Almost
[59:33.700 --> 59:34.700]  Forgot.
[59:34.700 --> 59:38.500]  We're selling them all at cost at InfoWarsStore.com.
[59:38.500 --> 59:44.340]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts,
[59:44.340 --> 59:51.140]  any other shirts, they're all selling at cost, InfoWarsStore.com.
[59:51.140 --> 1:00:16.420]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:16.420 --> 1:00:24.860]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:24.860 --> 1:00:25.860]  Good evening.
[1:00:25.860 --> 1:00:29.540]  The time is 5 p.m. central here in Minneapolis, the belly of the beast.
[1:00:29.540 --> 1:00:35.580]  I am your guest host Royce White, I'm your guest hosting InfoWars next hour.
[1:00:35.580 --> 1:00:38.940]  This segment I just want to talk about my campaign a little bit and then we're going
[1:00:38.940 --> 1:00:42.620]  to kick it back to Alex to talk more about this Buffalo situation because nobody speaks
[1:00:42.620 --> 1:00:46.900]  to a situation like this better than he can and then we're going to bring David Penn
[1:00:46.900 --> 1:00:52.700]  back in the later part of the hour to have some more interviews about broader issues,
[1:00:52.700 --> 1:00:57.260]  nationalism versus globalism in the World Health Organization Treaty, which is fallen
[1:00:57.260 --> 1:01:01.020]  by the wayside given all of this other news.
[1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:03.020]  We can beat these people.
[1:01:03.020 --> 1:01:09.740]  We can beat these people if we dedicate and commit ourselves right here, right now.
[1:01:09.740 --> 1:01:13.220]  I don't want to hear that they're going to steal the election from us in 2022.
[1:01:13.220 --> 1:01:17.220]  I don't want to hear that they're going to steal the election from us from 2024.
[1:01:17.220 --> 1:01:22.340]  As an athlete, when the deck is stacked against you, you dig down deep, you bite your mouth
[1:01:22.340 --> 1:01:27.940]  piece, you bite your tongue, you bite the inside of your lip, whatever it is, and you
[1:01:27.940 --> 1:01:29.620]  find a way.
[1:01:29.620 --> 1:01:31.500]  That's what grit is.
[1:01:31.500 --> 1:01:39.220]  That's the best thing America has to offer is grit, pride, honor, sacred honor.
[1:01:39.220 --> 1:01:41.900]  We've been sold out.
[1:01:41.900 --> 1:01:44.940]  We've gotten the government we deserve, but we can turn it around.
[1:01:44.940 --> 1:01:50.020]  I'm running for United States Congress against Ilhan Omar, who is about as un-American as
[1:01:50.020 --> 1:01:52.380]  you could possibly imagine.
[1:01:52.380 --> 1:01:53.380]  She's in on it.
[1:01:53.380 --> 1:01:55.340]  She's in on it with the globalists.
[1:01:55.340 --> 1:01:56.780]  She's in on it with the leftists.
[1:01:56.780 --> 1:02:01.540]  She's in on it with the progressives, the AOCs, the anti-human, the trans-human.
[1:02:01.540 --> 1:02:04.460]  She's in on it with everybody she can be in on it with.
[1:02:04.460 --> 1:02:12.220]  The scary thing is she has broad support and massive appeal to the mainstream media and
[1:02:12.220 --> 1:02:13.980]  commercial market.
[1:02:13.980 --> 1:02:15.780]  We have to become activated.
[1:02:15.780 --> 1:02:20.140]  We have to continue to support America first candidates all over this country.
[1:02:20.140 --> 1:02:23.420]  If they cheat us, we will know it.
[1:02:23.420 --> 1:02:28.100]  We will know it and we will respond as such.
[1:02:28.100 --> 1:02:33.580]  Now, I have to explain this to you in a little bit more depth so you can understand the uphill
[1:02:33.580 --> 1:02:35.620]  battle we face.
[1:02:35.620 --> 1:02:40.620]  There is a fundraising process in our country that is taking place right now in the Republican
[1:02:40.620 --> 1:02:46.340]  establishment and the Democrat establishment everywhere in between.
[1:02:46.340 --> 1:02:52.220]  There are bundlers, third-party bundlers, brokers, who sign on to raise money for campaigns
[1:02:52.220 --> 1:02:55.500]  such as mine, and it comes with strings attached.
[1:02:55.500 --> 1:03:03.300]  The strings are that the third-party broker gets 85 percent of the split, 85 cents on
[1:03:03.300 --> 1:03:10.380]  the dollar that American citizens donate through these brokers go straight into somebody's
[1:03:10.380 --> 1:03:11.380]  pocket.
[1:03:11.380 --> 1:03:16.980]  Now, during my campaign, I have made it clear to all of these third-party grifters that
[1:03:16.980 --> 1:03:21.860]  I will not allow them to scam the American people, the American taxpayer, the working
[1:03:21.860 --> 1:03:27.260]  class, our citizens by agreeing to this 85-15 split.
[1:03:27.260 --> 1:03:31.060]  In fact, I told them nobody gets above 25 percent.
[1:03:31.060 --> 1:03:37.660]  As you can imagine, because the 85 percent is so commonly accepted, I have not been able
[1:03:37.660 --> 1:03:44.340]  to raise money like my primary opponent, Cece Davis, who raised $1.1 million and she's
[1:03:44.340 --> 1:03:48.980]  already spent a million of it, which has gone to these third-party donors.
[1:03:48.980 --> 1:03:54.100]  So, go and check out my campaign website, RoyceWhite.us, if you have the chance.
[1:03:54.100 --> 1:03:56.220]  Also continue to support Alex Jones.
[1:03:56.220 --> 1:04:01.860]  I cannot express enough my gratitude that he has gotten behind my candidacy and allowed
[1:04:01.860 --> 1:04:09.380]  me to speak to this audience, which is the most awake and spiritual audience in our country
[1:04:09.380 --> 1:04:10.980]  and around the world.
[1:04:10.980 --> 1:04:11.980]  Thank you for your support.
[1:04:11.980 --> 1:04:13.940]  I hear it every day, all the time.
[1:04:13.940 --> 1:04:15.540]  I'm getting your feedback.
[1:04:15.540 --> 1:04:22.740]  I love that people are open to politicians starting to talk about God.
[1:04:22.740 --> 1:04:27.180]  Again, I come from a Christian background, a Catholic upbringing, and there are problems
[1:04:27.180 --> 1:04:31.540]  in the Catholic Church as well, and I'll talk about those one day with a full throat.
[1:04:31.540 --> 1:04:32.900]  But today is not about that.
[1:04:32.900 --> 1:04:38.020]  Today is about the third-party grifters who scam the American people.
[1:04:38.020 --> 1:04:42.740]  I'm kicking it to Alex Jones to talk about the Buffalo shooting because nobody can speak
[1:04:42.740 --> 1:04:44.540]  to these issues like he can.
[1:04:44.540 --> 1:04:45.540]  He is the czar.
[1:04:45.540 --> 1:04:48.180]  He is the guru around these types of situations.
[1:04:48.180 --> 1:04:50.460]  I'll be back with you after this next segment.
[1:04:50.460 --> 1:04:51.460]  Stay tuned.
[1:04:51.460 --> 1:04:52.460]  This is Info Wars.
[1:04:52.460 --> 1:05:00.020]  I'm Alex Jones, Royce White in the belly of the beast, and he happens to be the same.
[1:05:00.020 --> 1:05:05.420]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[1:05:05.420 --> 1:05:06.940]  a healthier life.
[1:05:06.940 --> 1:05:10.660]  Info Wars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with
[1:05:10.660 --> 1:05:12.940]  a supplement that contains both.
[1:05:12.940 --> 1:05:17.900]  This Info Wars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[1:05:17.900 --> 1:05:19.500]  from the Info Wars store.
[1:05:19.500 --> 1:05:24.340]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[1:05:24.340 --> 1:05:27.060]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:05:27.060 --> 1:05:31.940]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[1:05:31.940 --> 1:05:36.580]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[1:05:36.580 --> 1:05:37.580]  shown.
[1:05:37.580 --> 1:05:41.860]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[1:05:41.860 --> 1:05:46.460]  role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:05:46.460 --> 1:05:51.540]  But it's been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[1:05:51.540 --> 1:05:52.540]  like here in America.
[1:05:52.540 --> 1:05:57.380]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com where we promise
[1:05:57.380 --> 1:06:15.700]  our rose hips don't lie.
[1:06:15.700 --> 1:06:20.700]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:06:20.700 --> 1:06:30.540]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:30.540 --> 1:06:35.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much again for joining us on this very, very serious
[1:06:35.380 --> 1:06:37.420]  Emergency Sunday broadcast.
[1:06:37.420 --> 1:06:41.380]  Roy Swight with a special guest, David Pitt is going to be coming back up for the balance
[1:06:41.380 --> 1:06:42.380]  of the hour.
[1:06:42.380 --> 1:06:49.260]  We are now into hour number two, and we have this terrible white supremacist attack at
[1:06:49.260 --> 1:06:54.380]  a predominantly black grocery store in Buffalo, New York.
[1:06:54.380 --> 1:06:59.380]  As predicted, he's an 18-year-old in the cell, and the corporate globalist media is saying,
[1:06:59.380 --> 1:07:03.940]  well, we need to ban all conservative media because it's their fault this happened, and
[1:07:03.940 --> 1:07:07.620]  we need to censor everybody in live time, and we need to take all the guns despite the
[1:07:07.620 --> 1:07:15.380]  fact that he was red flagged a year ago, specifically saying he was going to use guns for violence
[1:07:15.380 --> 1:07:22.180]  and target minorities, and perfectly said, perfectly on time, the FBI, the Justice Department
[1:07:22.180 --> 1:07:26.380]  says that there are white supremacist attacks that are imminent, that white supremacist
[1:07:26.380 --> 1:07:30.060]  attacks are off the chart, though statistically they're incredibly rare, and that they were
[1:07:30.060 --> 1:07:33.980]  going to happen right before the midterms, and suddenly it happens, just like the Governor
[1:07:33.980 --> 1:07:38.780]  Whitmer kidnapping plot, which came out in court, was staged and led by the FBI.
[1:07:38.780 --> 1:07:41.820]  Was this completely staged and run by the FBI and Justice Department?
[1:07:41.820 --> 1:07:46.260]  We don't know that yet, but historically, in many cases, it is.
[1:07:46.260 --> 1:07:50.820]  We're not saying no one died, we're not saying a tragedy didn't take place, and we're not
[1:07:50.820 --> 1:07:52.660]  saying that tragedy isn't a terrible thing.
[1:07:52.660 --> 1:07:59.180]  What we're saying is, collectively, Republicans and conservatives and libertarians and populists
[1:07:59.180 --> 1:08:05.740]  and nationalists, white people are not to blame for what this crazy man did, and we
[1:08:05.740 --> 1:08:12.460]  decry it, and Dylan Roof at the church years ago killing 10 black people as well, and the
[1:08:12.460 --> 1:08:17.260]  terrible black supremacist at Kenosha running over people with his car because they were
[1:08:17.260 --> 1:08:20.860]  white, and the media covering that up, or Black Lives Matter connected groups going
[1:08:20.860 --> 1:08:26.260]  and shooting cops, including black cops, just because they're cops, that's all wrong, but
[1:08:26.260 --> 1:08:29.660]  the globalists are about to implode the currency, they're bringing in a world government.
[1:08:29.660 --> 1:08:31.660]  They need a domestic crisis.
[1:08:31.660 --> 1:08:39.500]  They need a cascading civil war as the pretext to bring in phase two of the COVID lockdowns,
[1:08:39.500 --> 1:08:43.420]  the martial law race war lockdowns.
[1:08:43.420 --> 1:08:48.380]  So whenever thousands of white people get killed a year because they're white, the
[1:08:48.380 --> 1:08:50.820]  media covers it up.
[1:08:50.820 --> 1:08:55.740]  But when a crazy white person goes and kills innocent black people, women, first people
[1:08:55.740 --> 1:09:00.740]  they killed reportedly, you know, we have the live stream shooter video from Twitch,
[1:09:00.740 --> 1:09:01.740]  is Twitch to blame?
[1:09:01.740 --> 1:09:02.740]  No.
[1:09:02.740 --> 1:09:04.420]  You can call somebody up on the phone while you're killing people.
[1:09:04.420 --> 1:09:05.420]  Is AT&T to blame?
[1:09:05.420 --> 1:09:10.660]  Well, then why was Gab blamed a few years ago when a white supremacist went into a synagogue
[1:09:10.660 --> 1:09:15.260]  and shot innocent people, terrible crime, because he put on Gab, he was about to do it five
[1:09:15.260 --> 1:09:16.660]  minutes before.
[1:09:16.660 --> 1:09:21.740]  Again, you do not blame the telecommunications mediums that people commit crimes on.
[1:09:21.740 --> 1:09:25.820]  But somebody calls up on 9-1-1, my husband's killing the children with a hatchet.
[1:09:25.820 --> 1:09:28.060]  Do you blame Verizon?
[1:09:28.060 --> 1:09:30.220]  Do you blame Southwestern Bell?
[1:09:30.220 --> 1:09:31.660]  I mean, it's crazy.
[1:09:31.660 --> 1:09:37.260]  So there's a lot of different facets to all of this that we're going to be breaking down
[1:09:37.260 --> 1:09:38.260]  and covering.
[1:09:38.260 --> 1:09:41.700]  I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central by regular show to cover it all.
[1:09:41.700 --> 1:09:45.500]  Weekday mornings you have, of course, American Journal, there's a Smith doing a great job,
[1:09:45.500 --> 1:09:46.500]  the war room.
[1:09:46.500 --> 1:09:49.700]  But Royce White's about to come back and talk more about this with a special guest.
[1:09:49.700 --> 1:09:54.060]  He was supposed to be hosting today, but all of this came out, all of this unfolded, so
[1:09:54.060 --> 1:09:58.700]  I came in here to give you my breakdown of this, but here's the bottom line.
[1:09:58.700 --> 1:10:03.340]  The globalists are planning and provocaturing more of this.
[1:10:03.340 --> 1:10:04.340]  It follows the script.
[1:10:04.340 --> 1:10:07.980]  It's how I was able to specifically, exactly predict it all.
[1:10:07.980 --> 1:10:11.300]  Now, there's a bunch of these videos from the last year and a half, two years being
[1:10:11.300 --> 1:10:13.140]  posted to Band Out Video right now.
[1:10:13.140 --> 1:10:14.540]  We have to have our own platforms.
[1:10:14.540 --> 1:10:17.100]  We're banned everywhere else to show you how right we were.
[1:10:17.100 --> 1:10:22.500]  I suggest you go watch them, but here's about five minutes or so of some of these specific
[1:10:22.500 --> 1:10:29.060]  exact predictions because I'm in the mind of the globalists and their war games and
[1:10:29.060 --> 1:10:33.220]  their anti-white propaganda, which they know will trigger some unstable white people to
[1:10:33.220 --> 1:10:37.620]  buy into this and go be in a race war because there is an undeclared race war against white
[1:10:37.620 --> 1:10:41.180]  people run by the left to cause the real race war.
[1:10:41.180 --> 1:10:42.180]  So it's wrong.
[1:10:42.180 --> 1:10:43.180]  We love black people.
[1:10:43.180 --> 1:10:44.180]  We love white people.
[1:10:44.180 --> 1:10:45.180]  We love everybody.
[1:10:45.180 --> 1:10:48.660]  We want to see all the movies and all the shows that whites are the devil and there's
[1:10:48.660 --> 1:10:54.460]  going to be a civil war and all, you know, get out and the purge and all of it as the
[1:10:54.460 --> 1:10:59.140]  left tries to prepare with movies like The Joker for a civil war that collapses America
[1:10:59.140 --> 1:11:00.180]  on the other side of it.
[1:11:00.180 --> 1:11:03.180]  They bring in absolute control over humanity.
[1:11:03.180 --> 1:11:04.180]  Infowars.com.
[1:11:04.180 --> 1:11:05.900]  Tomorrow's news today.
[1:11:05.900 --> 1:11:10.620]  Here is just a segment or just part of the last couple of years where I specifically
[1:11:10.620 --> 1:11:11.620]  predicted it.
[1:11:11.620 --> 1:11:14.420]  Last week I did a whole segment on Friday a few days ago.
[1:11:14.420 --> 1:11:15.420]  You're telling it all.
[1:11:15.420 --> 1:11:16.420]  We'll be airing that tomorrow.
[1:11:16.420 --> 1:11:17.620]  We're going to play a few minutes of this.
[1:11:17.620 --> 1:11:21.340]  Go to break and come back with Royce White here on the live Sunday edition of the Alex
[1:11:21.340 --> 1:11:22.340]  Jones show.
[1:11:22.340 --> 1:11:25.540]  So what are they going to do?
[1:11:25.540 --> 1:11:32.980]  They're going to attack a minority church or college or grocery store, some type of minority
[1:11:32.980 --> 1:11:36.300]  gathering or a mass of white supremacist attack they stage.
[1:11:36.300 --> 1:11:38.340]  That's all the pre-programming in the media.
[1:11:38.340 --> 1:11:39.340]  So you know what's coming.
[1:11:39.340 --> 1:11:43.180]  You're going to be bad because you were a Republican voter, period.
[1:11:43.180 --> 1:11:48.020]  That's how they intend to do this is connect the Republican party to white supremacism
[1:11:48.020 --> 1:11:49.180]  and the Second Amendment to it.
[1:11:49.180 --> 1:11:52.900]  That's how they're pushing for violence and preparing real false flags.
[1:11:52.900 --> 1:11:56.620]  Not just guys dressed up like white nationalists to discredit the Republican gubernatorial
[1:11:56.620 --> 1:11:59.380]  candidate in Virginia, but violence, my friends.
[1:11:59.380 --> 1:12:06.100]  And that's so if you go to a black church or you go to a rural, say, black grocery store,
[1:12:06.100 --> 1:12:08.780]  you better be packing.
[1:12:08.780 --> 1:12:09.780]  You better be watching.
[1:12:09.780 --> 1:12:27.820]  Because let me tell you, deep states are coming.
[1:12:27.820 --> 1:12:30.420]  So what are they going to do?
[1:12:30.420 --> 1:12:37.180]  They're going to attack a minority church or college or grocery store, some type of
[1:12:37.180 --> 1:12:41.100]  minority gathering.
[1:12:41.100 --> 1:12:43.740]  And they're either going to completely false flag it and do it 100% themselves or they're
[1:12:43.740 --> 1:12:49.900]  going to find mentally ill in cell white supremacist types will really be devil worshipers waxed
[1:12:49.900 --> 1:12:52.140]  out of their minds on prescription and illegal drugs.
[1:12:52.140 --> 1:12:56.980]  It will be a two or three man idiot squad that will go in and start shooting black people
[1:12:56.980 --> 1:12:58.060]  at a church.
[1:12:58.060 --> 1:13:03.300]  Then there'll be a backup team that will kill them claiming they committed suicide who will
[1:13:03.300 --> 1:13:08.820]  then actually kill a couple hundred black people because the Satanist always starts
[1:13:08.820 --> 1:13:11.580]  shooting people and they kind of wow, I'm actually killing somebody.
[1:13:11.580 --> 1:13:13.220]  This isn't as cool as I thought.
[1:13:13.220 --> 1:13:15.140]  And then they get killed by the black op team.
[1:13:15.140 --> 1:13:17.980]  The black op team then kills the lion share of the people.
[1:13:17.980 --> 1:13:21.700]  They're going to want a big number, hundreds of dead black children.
[1:13:21.700 --> 1:13:29.980]  So if you go to a black church or you go to a rural, say, black grocery store, you better
[1:13:29.980 --> 1:13:30.980]  be packing.
[1:13:30.980 --> 1:13:34.900]  You better be watching because let me tell you, the deep states are coming.
[1:13:34.900 --> 1:13:38.420]  It's going to be the whole collapse of society and you're going to be bad because you were
[1:13:38.420 --> 1:13:40.660]  a Republican voter period.
[1:13:40.660 --> 1:13:45.500]  That's how they intend to do this is connect the Republican party to white supremacism
[1:13:45.500 --> 1:13:47.020]  and the second amendment to it.
[1:13:47.020 --> 1:13:48.660]  That's how they plan to overturn it.
[1:13:48.660 --> 1:13:50.880]  That's the whole program you're seeing right now.
[1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:52.960]  But if the people are aware of it, it's over.
[1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:55.380]  This is the new world order's revolution.
[1:13:55.380 --> 1:13:59.020]  This is an assault and it only gets worse from here.
[1:13:59.020 --> 1:14:04.460]  And that's why no matter how much heat they get and how bad they look and no matter how
[1:14:04.460 --> 1:14:11.620]  much ever they do falls apart, they are moving towards state staging massive terror attacks
[1:14:11.620 --> 1:14:18.220]  and other crises to blame their opposition and frame us for terror so they can move directly
[1:14:18.220 --> 1:14:19.220]  against us.
[1:14:19.220 --> 1:14:20.700]  They're going to try to launch a race war.
[1:14:20.700 --> 1:14:24.900]  They're going to pull off a false flag event, try to blame, of course, the gun owners and
[1:14:24.900 --> 1:14:27.580]  Trump supporters and Christians and so on.
[1:14:27.580 --> 1:14:31.780]  They will see if the people will comply to turn in their guns, which I believe people
[1:14:31.780 --> 1:14:33.420]  will not comply.
[1:14:33.420 --> 1:14:38.420]  That would be insane at this point with the police being defunded and violent crime exploding
[1:14:38.420 --> 1:14:40.140]  all across liberal cities everywhere.
[1:14:40.140 --> 1:14:45.460]  People need self-defense more than ever, including, by the way, women and people of color and
[1:14:45.460 --> 1:14:51.700]  also gays and lesbians and transgenders are buying guns more than ever before right now.
[1:14:51.700 --> 1:14:54.140]  So it's the left that's buying guns more than ever.
[1:14:54.140 --> 1:14:59.140]  So it's going to make gun control very difficult among left-wing legislators.
[1:14:59.140 --> 1:15:02.940]  So they're going to try to push a false flag and they're going to try to take the guns.
[1:15:02.940 --> 1:15:08.620]  If we, the American people, if we surrender our guns, I believe we will be invaded.
[1:15:08.620 --> 1:15:14.540]  They are planning, in my view, false flag terror attacks here in America to submit their rollout
[1:15:14.540 --> 1:15:17.260]  against this massive white supremacist attack they staged.
[1:15:17.260 --> 1:15:20.180]  That's all the pre-programming in the media so you know what's coming.
[1:15:20.180 --> 1:15:24.420]  So they're pushing for violence and preparing real false flags, not just guys dressed up
[1:15:24.420 --> 1:15:29.300]  like white nationalists to discredit the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Virginia, but violence,
[1:15:29.300 --> 1:15:34.100]  my friends, and that's why they're freaking out because that's the card they want to play.
[1:15:34.100 --> 1:16:00.100]  That's the point we've gotten to.
[1:16:00.100 --> 1:16:05.580]  What's going on?
[1:16:05.580 --> 1:16:07.480]  Hi, Alex.
[1:16:07.480 --> 1:16:18.060]  Thanks for taking my call.
[1:16:18.060 --> 1:16:20.560]  Can I plug Alex real quick?
[1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:21.880]  Yeah, go ahead.
[1:16:21.880 --> 1:16:23.580]  Hey, I'm in my sixties and I do the work of twenty-five thirty-year-olds and I work them
[1:16:23.580 --> 1:16:25.260]  into the ground and you want to know why?

[1:16:29.820 --> 1:16:36.140]  I pay a price. I really do. I take that B-12 and I'm electric, man. I can run 10 miles.
[1:16:36.140 --> 1:16:42.500]  I did some pretty heavy work with a highway department and my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah,
[1:16:42.580 --> 1:16:50.220]  for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70, and I'm not just blowing smoke here. The B-12 saves my life.

[1:21:34.460 --> 1:21:42.620]  overstate how InfoWars is one of the last bastions of freedom, free speech, and truth in the
[1:21:42.620 --> 1:21:47.340]  entire world. I want to bring back in my guest David Penn. We're going to touch on the World Health
[1:21:47.340 --> 1:21:54.140]  Organization Treaty to underscore what Alex Jones was just alluding to, and David Penn brought this
[1:21:54.140 --> 1:21:59.660]  to my attention in the last few weeks, which I had not been aware of because I'm in the middle
[1:21:59.660 --> 1:22:07.580]  of a congressional district race with an American trader. Before you go, David, and I want you to
[1:22:07.580 --> 1:22:13.580]  touch on the World Health Organization Treaty and what you see it as and what you think it means,
[1:22:13.580 --> 1:22:23.420]  but before you go, I just want to read for people something here that again reiterates that this
[1:22:23.420 --> 1:22:29.900]  is not conspiracy theory. There are real conspiracies. We'll know our disinformation
[1:22:29.900 --> 1:22:35.420]  program is complete when everything the US public believes is false. That was CIA Director William
[1:22:35.420 --> 1:22:44.140]  J. Casey, and the Globalist Agenda and Initiative is on full throttle. We know that race is a main
[1:22:44.140 --> 1:22:53.420]  catalyst of violence, anarchy, and distrust. David, WHO Treaty, what do you think about it?
[1:22:55.500 --> 1:23:04.220]  I think that six corporations control 90% of the media that is consumed here in the United States
[1:23:04.220 --> 1:23:10.620]  of America, so we don't really have choice. We have the illusion of choice. Therefore,
[1:23:10.620 --> 1:23:20.380]  the fact that, Royce, you weren't aware of this treaty situation or that I didn't listen to Alex
[1:23:20.380 --> 1:23:27.020]  Jones for the last 15 years for all kinds of reasons, and suddenly I listened to him and I
[1:23:27.020 --> 1:23:32.620]  found out it was completely different than what I was led to believe it was. This is what you're
[1:23:32.620 --> 1:23:41.980]  talking about with this William Casey quote. This globalism issue has been going on for 2000 years,
[1:23:42.700 --> 1:23:51.740]  but it really reached a high level of criticality after World War II. And in 1947, just after the
[1:23:51.740 --> 1:24:00.300]  war, our government under Harry Truman signed the World Health Organization Original Charter Treaty,
[1:24:00.300 --> 1:24:05.900]  and we are a signatory to that treaty and we participated in it. We, as a country, saw the
[1:24:07.180 --> 1:24:11.820]  influence and the reach of the World Health Organization over the last several years as we
[1:24:11.820 --> 1:24:21.740]  suffered through this COVID-19 pandemic. Now, we find out maybe three or four weeks ago, and I can
[1:24:21.740 --> 1:24:27.020]  only share with the audience what I understand, and the reason why I say what I understand is
[1:24:27.020 --> 1:24:35.340]  there's an almost complete blackout of information about this World Health Organization 75th
[1:24:35.980 --> 1:24:43.820]  convention going back to their formation in 1947. This is a very interesting convention they're
[1:24:43.820 --> 1:24:49.340]  going to have in Geneva, Switzerland. The Biden administration, apparently, from what I've been
[1:24:49.340 --> 1:25:02.380]  able to discern in January, proposed amendments to the treaty, which would pass control of the U.S.
[1:25:02.380 --> 1:25:10.380]  governmental authority to the World Health Organization in the event that a global health
[1:25:10.380 --> 1:25:19.660]  crisis or pandemic was declared. And because the treaty is already in place, these amendments will
[1:25:19.660 --> 1:25:27.580]  be passed, and the United States is going to cede its sovereignty to a globalist World Health
[1:25:27.580 --> 1:25:36.060]  Organization, United Nations of World Governance. So, as Royce had said earlier in the broadcast,
[1:25:36.060 --> 1:25:46.540]  we're playing from the down position. We've lost control, and these amendments will take no
[1:25:47.340 --> 1:25:54.460]  action by our Congress, no ratification, no debate from what I understand that this will pass,
[1:25:54.460 --> 1:25:58.540]  that there is already a sufficient number of countries that are going to vote for this.
[1:25:59.180 --> 1:26:04.300]  And I just want the audience to understand that, you know, what's a health emergency?
[1:26:04.300 --> 1:26:10.540]  Could it be gun violence? Could it be an environmental crisis? Under what auspices
[1:26:10.540 --> 1:26:18.780]  will our control be transferred? But I want to say also never fear, because this treaty is a piece
[1:26:18.780 --> 1:26:25.420]  of paper. I'm a political activist working in Minnesota. I work in the Republican Party.
[1:26:25.420 --> 1:26:33.420]  I believe that every person in this audience that we represent the most aware, knowledgeable,
[1:26:33.420 --> 1:26:41.420]  and spiritually alive media audience on the planet Earth. And the first step, of course,
[1:26:41.420 --> 1:26:47.420]  is that awareness. But when you reach that awareness, we've got to get active. I got active.
[1:26:47.420 --> 1:26:59.020]  I wasn't active for years. I abdicated my authority and trusted in other men to lead me into govern
[1:26:59.020 --> 1:27:05.260]  my country. And I realized they're evil people. So because we have a constitution,
[1:27:05.260 --> 1:27:13.100]  because we have a political process, I am fully empowered by my constitution in the most lawful
[1:27:13.100 --> 1:27:20.300]  and in the most beautiful ways, using oratory and composition to engage in a political process
[1:27:20.300 --> 1:27:26.620]  and speak to you, the audience, and encourage you with these words to please on Monday.
[1:27:27.340 --> 1:27:35.100]  Call every one of you. Call your local political unit. It's a precinct. It could be a base political
[1:27:35.100 --> 1:27:40.300]  operating unit. You put your city in and you go Republican Party. I know some people don't
[1:27:40.300 --> 1:27:45.420]  like the Republican Party, or they don't like the Democrat Party. But let's work within the
[1:27:45.420 --> 1:27:51.260]  party system, because that is the fastest and most powerful way that we, the people,
[1:27:51.260 --> 1:27:58.060]  can reclaim our government, which is our government of the people by the people for the people.
[1:27:58.060 --> 1:28:06.300]  And if we get involved, and we work together as one family, one American family, we can remove
[1:28:06.300 --> 1:28:13.980]  these evil people, these globalist evil people from our governance, take it back with sacred honor.
[1:28:13.980 --> 1:28:22.220]  In this W, this WHO worth World Health Organization treaty can be ripped up by a new American
[1:28:22.220 --> 1:28:28.540]  government and we can regain our freedom and our sovereignty and our sacred honor. Royce,
[1:28:28.540 --> 1:28:33.020]  I want to thank you for letting me say that. It's been weighing heavy on my heart. I want every
[1:28:33.020 --> 1:28:39.580]  person on Monday to get involved, every single listener. Thank you for that motivational speech,
[1:28:39.580 --> 1:28:44.140]  and he couldn't be more right. We do have to take this government back. We are in the 12th hour,
[1:28:44.700 --> 1:28:50.620]  right now is the time, and if we come together and we get active, we can take our country back.
[1:28:50.620 --> 1:28:55.580]  We cannot be nihilist. We cannot be hopeless. We have to do what we have to do in order to take
[1:28:55.580 --> 1:29:06.700]  America back. If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control,
[1:29:06.700 --> 1:29:15.020]  the asleep France that the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people are
[1:29:15.020 --> 1:29:21.500]  lost. Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare. You're in a car and you get knocked
[1:29:21.500 --> 1:29:29.980]  out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused. You have a concussion
[1:29:30.700 --> 1:29:35.660]  and that's what the globalists have done. They have stunned us. They have put us into a position
[1:29:35.660 --> 1:29:39.820]  of not knowing our bearings and then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave him a speech he called
[1:29:39.820 --> 1:29:44.780]  the great new narrative where he brags how the public is lost, how the culture in the media
[1:29:45.580 --> 1:29:49.980]  has been driven to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity over the
[1:29:49.980 --> 1:29:55.740]  edge of a cliff. That's what the great reset is. They need darkness to thrive. The light lives at

[1:33:06.060 --> 1:33:24.940]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[1:33:27.260 --> 1:33:34.300]  for those folks who've lost their job right now because a plant went down to mexico you know that
[1:33:34.300 --> 1:33:42.460]  isn't going to make you feel better and so what we have to do is to make sure that folks are trained
[1:33:42.460 --> 1:33:48.220]  for the jobs that are coming in now because some of those jobs of the past are just not going to
[1:33:48.220 --> 1:33:56.780]  come back and when somebody says like the person you just mentioned who i'm not going to advertise
[1:33:56.780 --> 1:34:02.380]  for that he's going to bring all these jobs back well how exactly are you going to do that what are
[1:34:02.380 --> 1:34:09.660]  you going to do there's no answer to it he just says well i'm going i'm going to negotiate a better
[1:34:09.660 --> 1:34:16.140]  deal well how how exactly are you going to negotiate that what magic wand do you have
[1:34:17.260 --> 1:34:24.620]  and usually the answer is he doesn't have an answer so what i've tried to do what my
[1:34:24.620 --> 1:34:30.940]  administration's tried to do is let's grow those manufacturing sectors like clean energy
[1:34:30.940 --> 1:34:38.460]  uh like some of these new technologies that are coming up let's focus on those we've set up for
[1:34:38.460 --> 1:34:45.820]  example manufacturing hubs where we work with universities local businesses local governments
[1:34:45.820 --> 1:34:55.340]  to create research labs that can take something like 3d printing or you know nanotechnology or
[1:34:55.340 --> 1:34:59.020]  all kinds of stuff that i can't really explain because you know scientists and really smart
[1:34:59.020 --> 1:35:05.100]  people know all about it and and said let's invest in this so that when the new jobs come
[1:35:05.900 --> 1:35:13.260]  they're coming here but i got to tell you that the days when you just being able to you just
[1:35:13.260 --> 1:35:19.740]  being willing to work hard and you can now walk into a plant and suddenly there's going to be a job
[1:35:19.740 --> 1:35:23.500]  for you for 30 years or 40 years that's just not going to be there for our kids
[1:35:23.500 --> 1:35:34.060]  the siniquon nan of black bourgeoisie sellouts barack obama i just wanted to play that clip
[1:35:34.780 --> 1:35:41.660]  for you all so that you can see what it looks like expose fact though for an elected official
[1:35:41.660 --> 1:35:46.700]  of the highest office in our country to stand before the american people in a town hall setting
[1:35:46.700 --> 1:35:54.300]  under the banner of a mainstream media institution like pbs and tell a complete lie what he just
[1:35:54.300 --> 1:36:01.100]  admitted to there was to give over the sovereignty and the future of the american working class in
[1:36:01.100 --> 1:36:09.420]  american citizenship to a technocratic football we have research labs we have uh coalitions between
[1:36:09.420 --> 1:36:15.180]  universities and and and tech companies who who who deal in technology that i don't understand
[1:36:15.180 --> 1:36:21.260]  because they're smarter than me that's scientism folks i want to bring back in david pin for one
[1:36:21.260 --> 1:36:27.820]  final segment of thought right now to talk about nationalism and globalism because i see the two
[1:36:28.780 --> 1:36:38.220]  the two sides being god versus satan obviously in the spiritual but politically at the highest
[1:36:38.220 --> 1:36:43.580]  level we're talking about nationalism versus globalism and david pin you were a former international
[1:36:43.580 --> 1:36:47.980]  businessman and still are an international businessman yourself and as you and i have
[1:36:47.980 --> 1:36:52.300]  said before and then discussed and agreed upon and i have said on this show that america was
[1:36:52.300 --> 1:36:58.860]  supposed to be a nation of shopkeepers that the second amendment paired with the entrepreneur the
[1:36:58.860 --> 1:37:05.260]  independent business owner created a safeguard against economic imperialism and we see that
[1:37:05.260 --> 1:37:11.580]  those safeguards are being being uh warred against every day and and the effort to take our second
[1:37:11.580 --> 1:37:20.300]  amendment rights is on the is on the move but also the the attempt to tear apart the middle
[1:37:20.300 --> 1:37:25.420]  class but also the middle market so i want to give you the last five minutes of this segment
[1:37:25.420 --> 1:37:30.780]  to talk about your thoughts on the middle market because i think a lot of people don't understand
[1:37:31.500 --> 1:37:39.340]  that the the the independent entrepreneur in this country is really one of the biggest targets
[1:37:39.340 --> 1:37:49.740]  of the globalist elite rise you're exactly correct uh and the reason why that is is the people that
[1:37:49.740 --> 1:37:55.580]  are in the middle market the independent business people that like myself i slept in a car when i
[1:37:55.580 --> 1:38:00.860]  was 17 years old i didn't get any money from my family i dug it out of the side of a mountain
[1:38:00.860 --> 1:38:08.540]  with my hands breaking my fingers those people uh that have worked their lifetime to create
[1:38:08.540 --> 1:38:17.500]  their own reality it's because of our freedom we have freedom to create and we also have
[1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:23.580]  thanksgiving and gratefulness many of us if not most of us because we know there's a great deal
[1:38:23.580 --> 1:38:30.780]  of divine providence involved with actually succeeding as an entrepreneur every day you're
[1:38:30.780 --> 1:38:35.980]  really depending on yourself and if you're really smart about it you recognize you're really
[1:38:35.980 --> 1:38:45.260]  depending on god and you know not to pass this by globalism nationalism our two ends of the same
[1:38:45.260 --> 1:38:52.380]  system we've waxed and waved between globalism and nationalism for 2000 years it's not globalism
[1:38:52.380 --> 1:38:58.860]  per se that's evil it's the faithlessness of the globalist that's evil we could have a faithless
[1:38:58.860 --> 1:39:04.780]  nationalist government that was corrupt and in fact it was the nationalism of the third rike
[1:39:04.780 --> 1:39:11.420]  and of japan in the world war two period which really discredited nationalism and led to this kind
[1:39:11.420 --> 1:39:18.300]  of globalist architecture it justified creating global governance and the the story was that
[1:39:18.300 --> 1:39:24.620]  through global governance we would avoid uh holocausts like we suffered in the world war
[1:39:24.620 --> 1:39:31.340]  two period but because the globalists themselves the people that want to leave this are faithless
[1:39:31.340 --> 1:39:36.620]  are faithless they're secular humanists they don't believe in the sanctity of life
[1:39:38.140 --> 1:39:46.060]  they're not capable of governing the world in a beautiful human centered way and and david as you
[1:39:46.060 --> 1:39:53.420]  and and and as i and as you and i have discussed um and and we agree upon that in order to have
[1:39:53.420 --> 1:39:57.420]  freedom you have to have self-governance but in order to have self-governance governance you have
[1:39:57.420 --> 1:40:05.020]  to have faith and i think it was st tomas equinus that said um it's not law and order that we want
[1:40:05.020 --> 1:40:11.820]  it's peace in order peace in order and and man can have peace when he submits his passions to his
[1:40:11.820 --> 1:40:17.260]  reasons and his reason to god and if you can have peace with himself then you can have peace with
[1:40:17.260 --> 1:40:24.700]  others and and thus you create order um i understand what you're saying about globalism
[1:40:24.700 --> 1:40:32.940]  not being the issue per se but i have told you before that it is my opinion that borders in a
[1:40:33.820 --> 1:40:44.540]  post a post uh what do i want to say a a post a post mapped out world where there is no new
[1:40:44.540 --> 1:40:51.660]  land to to go venture to that the borders actually place humble constraints on man's ambition to
[1:40:51.660 --> 1:40:58.700]  conquer that that at one point the the impetus towards imperialism or colonialism or or globalism
[1:40:58.700 --> 1:41:04.220]  the early stages of globalism are constrained by nation states and sovereign borders and i think
[1:41:04.220 --> 1:41:11.420]  it's a very technical philosophical argument to understand the mechanism culturally on man's
[1:41:11.420 --> 1:41:17.580]  ambitions and and from a psychological standpoint that it's not for you to conquer the entire world
[1:41:17.580 --> 1:41:24.060]  and it's not that humans can't come together in a collaborative effort to to have a peace and a
[1:41:24.060 --> 1:41:29.020]  court across this great nation um but but that oftentimes especially in our time and for the
[1:41:29.020 --> 1:41:34.380]  last 60 to 70 years since after world war two we have seen many of those efforts be corrupted
[1:41:34.380 --> 1:41:41.020]  right down to the bone your thoughts and i want to say rois that first in this in the same sentiment
[1:41:41.020 --> 1:41:46.700]  it's the middle market business people the small businessman that is a limit to the ambition of
[1:41:46.700 --> 1:41:52.860]  the globalist corporation that's why such a great effort is being made to get rid of the middle market
[1:41:52.860 --> 1:41:58.620]  because we're generally believers in god and we're there to serve we're not crass materialists just
[1:41:58.620 --> 1:42:03.420]  talking about price we're there for our customers we're there for employees we go about our business
[1:42:03.420 --> 1:42:11.740]  with love and that is an affront to the globalist so understand understand understand what david
[1:42:11.740 --> 1:42:16.140]  penn is saying right here and david we thank you for your time today and joining us and sharing
[1:42:16.140 --> 1:42:21.260]  your insights and hopefully when i get the guest host in the future we can have you back as well

[1:42:40.460 --> 1:42:46.940]  creates do not be misled into believing that those things are inherently evil that in fact the

[1:46:56.940 --> 1:47:12.940]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:47:12.940 --> 1:47:33.100]  i am your host roice white finishing up the bottom of the hour here with info wars and
[1:47:33.100 --> 1:47:38.780]  i appreciate alex jones and the entire info wars team for allowing me to host the mothership
[1:47:38.780 --> 1:47:43.660]  for the past two hours thank you to david pin and his time that he shared with us today and his
[1:47:43.660 --> 1:47:50.060]  insights thank you to alex as well for for dropping in and doing some some live work during the
[1:47:50.060 --> 1:47:57.340]  broadcast to finish up here i want to talk about the end game satan's end game and i talk about
[1:47:57.340 --> 1:48:05.020]  the spiritual a lot because i believe that the spiritual is where we can go to start to rebuild
[1:48:05.020 --> 1:48:10.940]  this nation and this world in the proper way they say that politics is downstream from culture
[1:48:10.940 --> 1:48:17.500]  well culture is downstream from the spiritual and and we have a spiritual rock we have a spiritual
[1:48:17.500 --> 1:48:25.580]  decay and i think like i said earlier you know democrats and republicans alike have been guilty
[1:48:25.580 --> 1:48:33.260]  of trading our sovereignty our freedoms our citizenship over to a corrupt elite and you
[1:48:33.260 --> 1:48:38.060]  have two distinct differences between the republican trade off and the democrat trade off
[1:48:39.580 --> 1:48:44.700]  in my opinion many republicans traded their freedoms for security the democrats traded
[1:48:44.700 --> 1:48:52.380]  their freedoms for material radical materialism a material high but it it's in effect it's the
[1:48:52.380 --> 1:49:01.420]  same thing and that impetus is how we ended up with a centrist globalist uniparty that is doing
[1:49:01.420 --> 1:49:08.460]  satan's work and they are doing satan's work but even even they are a little in the dark i believe
[1:49:08.460 --> 1:49:15.900]  about what satan's real agenda is um some some of them some of them are just satanists and i want
[1:49:15.900 --> 1:49:24.460]  to talk about the satanist and the satanist agenda it's my belief that satan's game that he's playing
[1:49:24.460 --> 1:49:32.780]  right now is to make god so angry that he just destroys the entire thing that's the end game
[1:49:32.780 --> 1:49:42.700]  ladies and gentlemen to make god so upset so sad so disgusted with the way the world has turned
[1:49:42.700 --> 1:49:49.580]  out with what people have become with the way we treat each other with the way we we revere
[1:49:49.580 --> 1:49:56.860]  his blessings his gifts children being first and foremost that he just says oh time to reset
[1:49:58.140 --> 1:50:05.020]  it's over time to start again and you can see this this impetus on the left in that
[1:50:06.060 --> 1:50:09.740]  you know it's it's one thing to kill other people
[1:50:11.820 --> 1:50:17.660]  and during world war two we did a lot of killing of other people and we've done so ever since
[1:50:17.660 --> 1:50:24.700]  despite any of these globalist collaboratives to try and upend geopolitical conflict and wars and
[1:50:25.260 --> 1:50:28.860]  and and military uh military deaths
[1:50:31.340 --> 1:50:36.380]  what what we what we see in fact is that
[1:50:38.780 --> 1:50:45.420]  people have become more prone to killing themselves whether it be physically
[1:50:45.420 --> 1:50:53.340]  be spiritually health wise informationally many people have bought in have signed up
[1:50:53.980 --> 1:50:59.980]  for the decay and i told my friend david earlier when we were talking before we jumped on air that
[1:50:59.980 --> 1:51:05.980]  you know yes the the elites are corrupt there's no doubt about that yes they have
[1:51:05.980 --> 1:51:15.580]  have for generations conspired to undermine citizenship to undermine uh freedom faith god
[1:51:16.940 --> 1:51:22.940]  all of the ideas that that we hold true dignity humility the list goes on
[1:51:24.380 --> 1:51:34.140]  but ultimately you get the government you deserve every constituency of people around the world
[1:51:34.140 --> 1:51:39.900]  the free people of the world have gotten the government that we deserve because we didn't
[1:51:39.900 --> 1:51:45.420]  want to stand up we didn't want to be alex jones now many of us are fans of alex and
[1:51:45.420 --> 1:51:50.460]  and we respect alex and we're grateful for him but we'd be all lying if we didn't admit
[1:51:51.020 --> 1:51:55.740]  that there are certain circles certain places certain certain times in our daily lives or
[1:51:55.740 --> 1:52:01.660]  throughout our life where we were afraid we were afraid to admit to watching alex jones we were
[1:52:01.660 --> 1:52:07.980]  afraid to admit that we believe the things alex jones said and i had an encounter like that not
[1:52:07.980 --> 1:52:13.340]  too recently with the washington post when they attempted to do a hit piece in which they associated
[1:52:13.340 --> 1:52:19.740]  me with alex jones and steve bannon and many others as being far right or or an extremist
[1:52:19.740 --> 1:52:28.700]  and i told the the the journalist of that of that article that i'm not ashamed i'm not ashamed
[1:52:28.700 --> 1:52:34.380]  that i admire alex jones i'm not ashamed to call alex jones an american hero i believe he's an
[1:52:34.380 --> 1:52:38.620]  american hero i believe it to the point where i'm willing to admit it in any circles i tell
[1:52:38.620 --> 1:52:44.460]  as many people as i can that they should listen to alex jones and info wars if they want to
[1:52:44.460 --> 1:52:48.700]  understand a 30 000 foot view of what humanity and society face today
[1:52:50.620 --> 1:52:57.260]  and he has been one of the few that have been willing to wrestle with the idea that satan has
[1:52:57.260 --> 1:53:03.020]  a game he has an initiative he has an agenda and he is playing it out through the political realm
[1:53:03.020 --> 1:53:09.100]  he is playing it out through the corporatocracy technocracy technology scientism all of the
[1:53:09.100 --> 1:53:14.700]  many avenues that that a that a supernatural being like satan has at his disposal to play
[1:53:14.700 --> 1:53:20.700]  his wicked game of lies but the first step to combat and satan is that we ourselves have to
[1:53:20.700 --> 1:53:28.380]  to commit to not lie ain't sure people tell their white lies here and there and and we can
[1:53:28.380 --> 1:53:33.580]  argue about how consequential those lies are but the reality is in the places where it mattered
[1:53:33.580 --> 1:53:41.820]  most in the places where we were where we were um commissioned by by god to hold the line to
[1:53:41.820 --> 1:53:48.700]  not bend the need and not capitulate we did we did and we've done it for too long there should be
[1:53:48.700 --> 1:53:58.140]  a thousand people in the streets of every small community across this country not up in arms and
[1:53:58.140 --> 1:54:04.540]  to create anarchy and chaos but to march the front door of the establishment and say we want our
[1:54:04.540 --> 1:54:12.140]  country back we want our lives back we understand the value of our citizenship we want our citizenship
[1:54:12.140 --> 1:54:21.820]  back we want our ability to live closer to god back we don't want all of these systemic globalist
[1:54:21.820 --> 1:54:31.340]  institutional corrupt roadblocks standing in the way of our of our spiritual faith played out in
[1:54:31.340 --> 1:54:39.500]  the physical world and much of that has happened and much of it we let happen again i believe
[1:54:39.500 --> 1:54:48.220]  satan's end game is to make god so upset that he just erases the entire thing god's winding up
[1:54:48.940 --> 1:54:55.020]  and i go back to the sanctity of life because i believe that is the best example of how far
[1:54:55.020 --> 1:55:06.220]  we've fallen from the path 40 to 40 to 50 million babies aborted every single year i mean let that
[1:55:06.220 --> 1:55:13.980]  sink in really let it sink in that we have conversations on a daily basis about minority
[1:55:13.980 --> 1:55:22.220]  groups who are endangered or at risk minority groups of whatever variety that are that are
[1:55:22.220 --> 1:55:29.820]  at risk that are marginalized nobody has been more marginalized in this country's history
[1:55:29.820 --> 1:55:37.260]  than the unborn the first the first action step to restoring our national honor and our sacred
[1:55:37.260 --> 1:55:42.700]  honor is to protect the citizenship of the unborn and i said this online the other day
[1:55:42.700 --> 1:55:49.180]  and i had somebody tell me by definition children who are not born are not citizens
[1:55:51.100 --> 1:55:56.140]  this is the level of cognitive dissonance and corruption and evil that we are facing
[1:55:56.140 --> 1:56:02.540]  but we have to become just as committed and action-oriented in our faith and our belief
[1:56:03.100 --> 1:56:12.140]  as they are in their disbelief and their non-faith and we can do that and we have to find enjoyment
[1:56:12.140 --> 1:56:17.420]  in that we have to reject the material high we have to reject the radical materialism that they
[1:56:17.420 --> 1:56:23.420]  have birthed and they have they have set in the center of the stage we have to reject that in
[1:56:23.420 --> 1:56:30.780]  order to get back closer to the path to get back closer to god and in that we can find the power
[1:56:30.780 --> 1:56:36.540]  and the strength and the courage and the clarity to reclaim our country our citizenship our sovereignty
[1:56:38.060 --> 1:56:44.620]  to reclaim our ability to live live as we want to live close to god
