[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  music
[00:10.000 --> 00:20.000]  music
[00:20.000 --> 00:28.000]  music
[00:28.000 --> 00:38.000]  music
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  It's Friday, May 27th.
[00:40.000 --> 00:46.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:46.000 --> 01:02.000]  music
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  Live from the Infowars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  Thank you for joining us on this live teleprompter-free Friday edition.
[01:17.000 --> 01:22.000]  We have Ted Nugent, who is fired up and really informative.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  He called me this morning and I said, you got to say this on air.
[01:25.000 --> 01:28.000]  Rattling through the whole history of how they know about these shooters,
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  the psychologists, the psychiatrists, the police,
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  and in every case, from the white supremacist a few weeks ago
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  in Buffalo to this new one, the tragic events of the of all day, Texas,
[01:37.000 --> 01:39.000]  which is unbelievable.
[01:39.000 --> 01:46.000]  I have been very judicious since Monday on not speculating,
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  trying to get the facts and to really look at what's going on.
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  And we know now that the official story has unraveled.
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  We now know that we have been lied to,
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  and we now know that outrageous things happen,
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  like the police going in and getting their own children,
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  and I don't blame them, while keeping other people from getting in.
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  Women forcing their way through police lines to go get their children.
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  A total disaster.
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  And we have sources that are involved in the investigation.
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  It basically concurs with what Tim Enlo,
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  school safety expert, he trains police around the state,
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.000]  said yesterday that once he got barricaded in
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  and was shooting through the door and it hit one officer in the top of the head,
[02:33.000 --> 02:34.000]  they didn't know if he killed everybody.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  They didn't know whether they were still alive.
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  They treated it as a hostage situation that turned into a giant bureaucratic event outside.
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  The issue is that this guy had been attacking people
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  and shooting people with BB guns and talking about violence for years
[02:50.000 --> 02:51.000]  and nothing was done.
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000]  And they were in a shootout with him for 12 minutes outside
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  and waited for backup and waited for body armor.
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.000]  And I'm not saying I'm the toughest guy around,
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  but I've taken guns away from people two times, pulled them on me
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  and I've taken knives away from people.
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  I'm not saying that the police are cowards nowadays,
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.000]  but they're so programmed to wait for orders
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  that more and more you see this type of crap.
[03:19.000 --> 03:22.000]  And if I saw somebody going into school
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.000]  and they were shooting at me and I had a gun,
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  I would attack them.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  That's just who I am.
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  And it's easy to Monday morning quarterback this whole thing,
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  but I would do it.
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  And I think most police officers would do it that I know.
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  I mean, most police I know are not wimps.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  And they go out and they're in dangerous situations every day.
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  You see cops do incredibly heroic things all the time on video.
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  I mean, so what the hell is going on here?
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  Because the police I've known in my life aren't wimps
[03:55.000 --> 03:57.000]  and they actually want to go after bad guys.
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  And until about 25 years ago, the police charged in.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  Now, sometimes hostages got killed
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  and sometimes crazy things went on.
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  But this is just insane.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  Now, it's now coming out in the Washington Post
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.000]  that you've all the parents were armed and ready to storm the school.
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  Yeah, those police are lucky that a civil war didn't start down there.
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  And I'm not calling for that.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  I'm just saying this is a tender box
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  and I've hunted down a new Evaldi.
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  I know the folks down there, they're good, hardworking people
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  basically everybody's got a gun.
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.000]  So there's a lot of facts, a lot of pieces of the puzzle here.
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  And even Tucker Carlson came out last night and said there's a cover up.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  But Biden's praising the police now.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  That tells you something.
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  And so I think it was a false flag.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  I think somebody secretly shot the kids and it wasn't him.
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  No, I don't think the evidence points towards that.
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.000]  But a definite stand down in not apprehending him before
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  and then letting him do this
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  and then having a 12 minute shootout with him
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  and letting him go in the building.
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  And after his ass, we'll be right back. Stay with us.
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  This is definitely the most amazing.
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  It is the purest, highest quality atomic iodine you're going to find.
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  Most other iodine out there is bound to other minerals
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  and compounds so you don't absorb it at all or fully.
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got a limited supply
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  and it's been sold out for months because supply chain break downs.
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.000]  But despite that, we're selling it at 25% off for one more week
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  and it goes back to full price.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  Within two weeks, the current sales rate is going to sell out.

[06:22.000 --> 06:26.000]  This lovely wife, Chamey, called me this morning.
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.000]  We had a nice discussion about the situation in the world
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  to put it in a friendly way.
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.000]  The very upset, very informative NRA board member
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  and obviously icon of American freedom.
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  He's going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  and he was just laying out the history
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  and reminding me of all these shooters
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  that psychologists and psychiatrists knew were going to do it
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  and police knew they were going to do it and nothing was done.
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.000]  Sometimes it turns out there are FBI informants
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.000]  or globalist leftist connected groups
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.000]  that are hyping up these lunatics.
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  We know that's going on.
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.000]  And it's mainstream news today.
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.000]  Buffalo News, Fox News, authorities investigating
[07:06.000 --> 07:08.000]  a retired federal agent
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  knew of Buffalo mass shooting plans in advance
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  and was reportedly communicating digitally, online,
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  and the reports are encouraging.
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  That's the report, not confirmed,
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  but the FBI confirms they're investigating.
[07:22.000 --> 07:26.000]  What in the hell is a retired federal agent doing
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.000]  talking to the 18-year-old autistic lunatic,
[07:29.000 --> 07:31.000]  not bashing autistic people's lunatics,
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  but autistic and they were saying
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  and then out of his mind on top of it,
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  that went there and killed those ten innocent black people
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  while they were buying groceries for their families.
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  So, I mean, there's that right there.
[07:43.000 --> 07:46.000]  And now the same thing is emerging.
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  And I heard this three days ago
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  from the internet researchers online.
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.000]  I looked at it and I thought, there's no way.
[07:52.000 --> 07:55.000]  And now, yet again,
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  weird fingerprints all over this thing.
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  Right on time for the election,
[07:59.000 --> 08:01.000]  I got the FBI's own statistics,
[08:01.000 --> 08:04.000]  suddenly mass shootings and school shootings
[08:04.000 --> 08:07.000]  are exploding this year
[08:07.000 --> 08:10.000]  up since the highest levels ever.
[08:10.000 --> 08:13.000]  Magically this year, going into the midterms.
[08:13.000 --> 08:16.000]  Boy, we did predict that, didn't we?
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.000]  So, I don't know what's going on
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.000]  and we don't have all the answers,
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  but we're being lied to
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000]  and something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  To quote Macbeth,
[08:29.000 --> 08:33.000]  Joe Biden praises police response in Uvalde shooting
[08:33.000 --> 08:36.000]  refuses to call for accountability.
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.000]  And that, for me, is the cherry on top.
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  Sure, it'd be easy to rush in and bash the police.
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  It'd be easy to rush in because it looks bad.
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.000]  And I was not operating as an apologist yesterday.
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  I was trying to look at the angle of what do you do
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  when somebody's barricaded and shooting through the door
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.000]  and you don't know if they've killed the kids or not.
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  But you cannot get away
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  from the 12-minute shootout outside
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  and then him going in the door right in front of the police
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.000]  and they sat there and waited for backup.
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.000]  What the hell did you do, signing up for that job?
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  It'd be one thing if a gunman was going off in the woods
[09:12.000 --> 09:13.000]  running from you.
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.000]  I'd say, wait for backup. Don't get killed.
[09:15.000 --> 09:16.000]  But they're going into school.
[09:16.000 --> 09:18.000]  You better get your ass in there.
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  Oh, wait. I got to wait. The procedures wait.
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  And I might shoot a kid and something might go wrong.
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  Well, you know what? You're not going to get in trouble for that.
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.000]  Because it'd be maybe one kid you accidentally shot
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  and five he's able to kill, but you save 14 or whatever.
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  That's hypothetical.
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  So we need to be training our men and women of law enforcement
[09:38.000 --> 09:45.000]  to charge in not to sit around.
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  But that's what they do.
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  And that's the training more and more.
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  And it's disgusting.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  I'm not bashing individual officers.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  We don't know all their names or the details.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  The FBI has the footage from inside the school.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  God knows where that'll go to some black hole.
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  But this whole thing stinks to high heaven yet again.
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.000]  Is it just complete incompetence or is it something else?
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  Well, we know what it is. It's evil.
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  It's evil in the hearts of men and women.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  So here's these headlines.
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  Joe Biden praises police response in Uvalde shooting
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.000]  refuses to call for accountability.
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.000]  New details of police response to Uvalde shooting
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  paint an incredibly disturbing picture.
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  Tucker Carlson accuses Texas cops of BS absolutely
[10:31.000 --> 10:34.000]  and lies over why school shooter wasn't taken down
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  until more than an hour after he began the slaughter.
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  Report police got their own children out of the school
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  while subduing other Uvalde parents.
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  Texas rep Tony Gonzalez has been accurate in the past
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  says Uvalde government was arrested four years ago
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  for threatening to shoot up the school.
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  We know there were arrests made.
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  We don't know it's not confirmed that it was this individual.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  Almost.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  But we do know this happened at the school previously.
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  Very suspicious, very serious area we need to investigate.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  Texas DPS, Texas Rangers telling me that it's incorrect
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  says Bill Melligan of Fox LA.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  There were two juveniles arrested on conspiracy charges
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  from a shooting plot several years back,
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.000]  but the Uvalde shooting was not involved in that incident
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  and was not arrested.
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  Two teens arrested in Mash County plot 2018 targeted
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  a Uvalde middle school.
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  Now, here's what we got from law enforcement sources.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  LEOs were in the building within four minutes of responding
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  and got into a shootout in the hallway
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  for the shooter barricaded himself in an unlocked classroom.
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  The interior doors are hardened and needed to be
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  breached with breaching tools.
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  They attempted to breach but was met with heavy gunfire
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  which forced them to pull back.
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  The last thing you want to do is shoot through a door
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  with people in it.
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.000]  Took a BOR attack team with a shield and key
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  from the facility to make entry into the ballistic shield
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  with a ballistic shield.
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  When they breached, they took heavy gunfire
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.000]  and they killed the shooter.
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  And one of the four patrol agents got shot
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  at the top of the head or grazed the top of the head.
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  So there's a mix of different things happening here,
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  but the folks that actually went in there,
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.000]  we praise them for their courage and what they did.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  But by the time they got there,
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.000]  he'd already killed almost everybody in the classroom.
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.000]  More heartbreak.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  Husband of teacher killed in Uvalde school shooting.
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  Subversive fatal heart attack.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  Megan Merkel, the fake royal, visits Uvalde
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  to delay Rosa's Texas School Shooting Memorial.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  What an opportunistic pig.
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  Uvalde schools locked down at least 48 times
[12:57.000 --> 12:58.000]  this academic year.
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  It's all up on infoworks.com.
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  Wow, learn how one heroic mother saved her two children
[13:03.000 --> 13:06.000]  from Uvalde school shooting was subdued by police,
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  released, ran around the back of the school,
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  climbed the fence, went in and saved her children.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  Put her in a uniform.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  There's photos of the bullet grazed head of the hero,
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  voter patrol agent, who went on a suicide mission
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.000]  to kill Uvalde shooter, which is what you signed up for.
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  So good job.
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  Another big article you're not going to see anywhere else
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  or not going to be any coverage.
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  Armed woman forts potential mass shooting
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  at Charleston apartment complex.
[13:30.000 --> 13:33.000]  Police say Chuck Schumer just shot down
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.000]  a measure to help schools protect children.
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  That'd want armed teachers or principals or coaches.
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  So that's just some of the news and information
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  we've got here today.
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  But it is time to stop letting our schools
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  be soft targets.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  Washington Post falsely links AR-15s to Nazi Germany.
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  What the hell is that up to do with it?
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  CBS News reveals bettos and eruptions
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.000]  of Uvalde press conference was orchestrated.
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  Are they going to tell us that birds fly in the sky next
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  or that fish swim in the sea?
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  Of course it was staged.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  And then here's the big one, Uvalde shooter fired gun
[14:09.000 --> 14:15.000]  for 12 minutes outside school before entering.
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  And this is what we're going to cover when we come back.
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.000]  This police lieutenant says cops were reluctant
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  to engage gunmen because they could have been shot.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  This is what's truly disgusting.
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  And who goes up there from the state police spokesperson
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  and makes a statement like that?
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  Even if it's true, it just is outrageous.
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  And I'm sure it is true.
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  So you're scared to get shot?
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  So there's kids getting killed?
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  Yeah, if some dude's in a cave who robbed a bank
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  and he's up there with high-powered rifles,
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  let him sit there for a month until he starves and comes out.
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  Don't go in and get killed.
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  Over, you know, $20,000, he steals hypothetically.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  But when there's children in a school
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  that you are sworn to protect,
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  I don't care the letter of the law says it's not your duty to,
[15:05.000 --> 15:11.000]  you have a duty as a man to go in there.
[15:11.000 --> 15:14.000]  It's disgusting.
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.000]  And I'm surprised that the armed citizens that almost stormed
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  the building didn't attack the police.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  And I'm glad they didn't.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  But this is going too far.
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  We got a whole system once the dishonored the people.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  We got all the scumbag politicians with their own bodyguards.
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  And they want to tell us that we can't have guns to protect ourselves.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  Then they take our tax money with property taxes
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  and make our children go to public school.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  Most people can't pay for private school.
[15:37.000 --> 15:38.000]  Most people got to work two jobs.
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.000]  They can't home school.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  You send your children in one of these damn places to get killed
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  and the police sit there with their thumbs up their asses.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  Excuse me.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  All right, we're going to come back with all of it
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  and the stand down video and just mix my blood boil.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  Even thinking about the video,

[18:54.840 --> 18:58.440]  action now. InfoWarsStore.com.
[18:59.440 --> 19:04.800]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training probably not
[19:04.800 --> 19:08.480]  as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness
[19:08.480 --> 19:13.840]  for InfoWarsStore.com. Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo
[19:13.840 --> 19:17.880]  force to give me that energy I need to get going. You know, besides the energy
[19:17.880 --> 19:22.560]  turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C, to keep me
[19:22.560 --> 19:26.600]  healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained
[19:26.600 --> 19:30.320]  energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training. And then
[19:30.320 --> 19:36.240]  every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones' sore list. I have bad joints. Thanks mom. So
[19:36.240 --> 19:39.840]  this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus
[19:39.840 --> 19:44.520]  inflammation support and extra flexibility. The quick release capsules
[19:44.520 --> 19:49.080]  help me recover fast so I can get back to the training. Even if you're not crazy
[19:49.080 --> 19:53.040]  enough to take on a marathon, good news. Turbo force that can still give you the
[19:53.040 --> 19:57.160]  energy and clarity you need for every day and sore list can keep you moving and
[19:57.160 --> 20:03.240]  feeling great at any age. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New
[20:03.240 --> 20:18.600]  World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:18.600 --> 20:22.240]  Hi, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this live Friday, May 27th
[20:22.240 --> 20:27.320]  transmission. So the DPS spokesperson, Lieutenant, they should really replace.
[20:27.320 --> 20:35.600]  I mean, he's up there defending, oh police didn't go in during the shootout
[20:35.600 --> 20:38.960]  when it started, because they might get shot. And then once they're in the
[20:38.960 --> 20:46.880]  building, they didn't want to get shot. I mean, we see these cases all the time
[20:46.880 --> 20:50.160]  where police are pinned down at some shooter's house, they're shooting at the
[20:50.160 --> 20:56.200]  cops and then a citizen opens fire from their house and kills the bastard. And I
[20:56.200 --> 21:00.760]  just watching the domestication be breaded to the police, everybody else,
[21:00.760 --> 21:05.560]  why are you wearing a uniform? Why do you have a badge if you don't want to go
[21:05.560 --> 21:10.760]  into harm's way? I mean, quite frankly, during crises like that, people, men get
[21:10.760 --> 21:13.760]  high as a kite, you're looking for a fight. I don't even know what these people's
[21:13.760 --> 21:21.280]  problem is. I mean, I can guarantee you if there's a son of a bitch shooting at me
[21:21.280 --> 21:24.320]  and I'm a cop and he goes into school, I'm going in there to kill him or die
[21:24.320 --> 21:30.800]  trying. And so it's easy to sit up here when we weren't the ones that are there
[21:30.800 --> 21:34.720]  and say it, but I know and the parents wanted to go in with their guns, they
[21:34.720 --> 21:39.360]  wanted to go save their children and they stopped them. And it's this attitude
[21:39.360 --> 21:44.360]  that we can't protect ourselves and that we can't have guns and I'm tired of it.
[21:44.360 --> 21:49.600]  Next segment I'll play the whole clip so it's in context, but here is the DPS
[21:49.600 --> 21:54.600]  spokesperson saying they're afraid to get shot. Here it is. They do not know
[21:54.600 --> 21:58.720]  where the gunman is. They're hearing gunshots. They are they are receiving
[21:58.720 --> 22:03.240]  gunshots. At that point, if they if they proceeded any further not knowing
[22:03.240 --> 22:06.600]  where the suspect was at, they could have been shot. They could have been killed
[22:06.600 --> 22:10.080]  and at that point that gunman would have the opportunity to kill other people
[22:10.080 --> 22:18.080]  inside that school. And now the kids are dead. Again, they're overthinking all of
[22:18.080 --> 22:21.240]  this. And I don't think that guy's a coward. I'm sure the police that stood
[22:21.240 --> 22:25.800]  down in real life aren't cowards, but they're they're they're not going with
[22:25.800 --> 22:31.280]  their instincts. They're not going. And I found that people that can even be
[22:31.280 --> 22:34.600]  physically strong and can train and fighting all day long. But when they
[22:34.600 --> 22:37.480]  really get to fight, they don't have the instincts to go for the jugular and
[22:37.480 --> 22:41.960]  they hold back. They don't turn it loose. And politically, culturally, we got to
[22:41.960 --> 22:46.720]  start turning it loose, getting in the left space, not backing down, not
[22:46.720 --> 22:53.280]  submitting and not being cowards. That's how we've gotten in this position. And
[22:53.280 --> 22:58.040]  how they send 50 something billion dollars to Ukraine now. Hell, it's about
[22:58.040 --> 23:04.400]  60 billion. Just in the last six months. Oh, but the police don't all have a
[23:04.400 --> 23:05.840]  ballistic shield in their trunk.
[23:05.840 --> 23:13.360]  They're not even trained on it. So you really, it's just unbelievable.
[23:19.200 --> 23:22.840]  It's unbelievable. And now they're turning the cops into bureaucrats all over
[23:22.840 --> 23:26.400]  the country. God, as bad as some of the police are in Texas, they're even worse
[23:26.400 --> 23:30.400]  in leftist areas. Not all of them. But it's just, I'm gonna stop right here.
[23:30.400 --> 23:36.360]  And I'm just gonna lay out more information. But what you need to know is
[23:36.360 --> 23:39.000]  they're trying to shut down the NRA Convention in Houston this weekend.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.520]  They're trying to act like the NRA's criminal and they're bad.
[23:43.880 --> 23:47.680]  A civil rights organization founded to train Northerners out of shooting armed
[23:47.680 --> 23:56.240]  blacks after civil war. And we got a bunch of Republicans coming out. I got a
[23:56.240 --> 24:01.040]  list of them here. McConnell pushes gun control with Dems and 10 other House
[24:01.040 --> 24:08.840]  Republicans. I mean, unbelievable. And just like every time they knew it, they
[24:08.840 --> 24:12.520]  knew he was planning a mass shooting, they knew he was mentally ill, but we
[24:12.520 --> 24:16.400]  don't have mental institutions anymore, ladies and gentlemen. Only you got a
[24:16.400 --> 24:20.280]  bunch of money. You got good insurance or whatever. They'll put you in a mental
[24:20.280 --> 24:23.480]  institution for no reason. But if you don't, you're going to be on the
[24:23.480 --> 24:28.760]  street, which is more of the argument for us to be armed. You know, we got armed
[24:28.760 --> 24:32.960]  guards here at the office we pay for. They're great people. And we got to do
[24:32.960 --> 24:36.320]  it because we're a target. And when they walk around with firearms on their
[24:36.320 --> 24:41.720]  hips and they got shotguns and AR-15s right there in their locker, we don't
[24:41.720 --> 24:45.600]  feel fearful because these are good, normal people with backgrounds and
[24:45.600 --> 24:49.920]  training that have proven they're good people. Why would we take their guns?
[24:49.920 --> 24:54.560]  Why would we have the politicians? Here's a great image for TV viewers. For
[24:54.560 --> 24:57.120]  radio listeners, it's an image of the barbed wire in the fence they set up
[24:57.120 --> 25:03.840]  last year around the U.S. Capitol with a U.S. National Guardsman with a fully
[25:03.840 --> 25:11.560]  automatic M-16. And he's sitting there and it says nobody needs a gun to
[25:11.560 --> 25:17.800]  protect them except the politicians. And another really good one. Cain killed
[25:17.800 --> 25:22.160]  Abel with a rock. The Lord didn't get rid of all the rocks. He blamed Cain, not
[25:22.160 --> 25:27.880]  the rock. We have a sin problem, not a gun problem. Amen to that. And I already
[25:27.880 --> 25:31.400]  showed this yesterday, but it's so powerful. It's Biden shows the U.S. He says,
[25:31.400 --> 25:35.520]  oh, it's a gun-free zone. But Ukraine is a free gun zone where they ship them
[25:35.520 --> 25:40.160]  tens of thousands of anti-aircrafts and anti-tank missiles that they know are
[25:40.160 --> 25:43.280]  falling out of the wrong hands and they don't give a damn because they'll use
[25:43.280 --> 25:49.240]  whatever crisis comes out of that for more power and more control. All right,
[25:49.240 --> 25:54.720]  Ted Nugent is loaded for bear. He's coming up. Roger Stone, that had 20-plus agents
[25:54.720 --> 26:00.720]  raid his house with machine guns in a CNN stunt for supposedly lying to
[26:00.720 --> 26:04.680]  Congress, which he didn't do. Well, they didn't have the 20-something SWAT team
[26:04.680 --> 26:07.960]  people there, did they? No, they had to politically persecute them. They have
[26:07.960 --> 26:12.360]  thousands of FBI agents and thousands of U.S. attorneys and assistant attorneys
[26:12.360 --> 26:15.680]  running around harassing January 6ers, many of which walked in peacefully,
[26:15.680 --> 26:20.640]  instead of the collapsing border, the child smelling all the rest of it. Now,
[26:20.640 --> 26:24.960]  I'm going to go ahead and tell you about something very important. We did not have
[26:24.960 --> 26:32.480]  this planned for this big Second Amendment event. We are proud of the
[26:32.480 --> 26:37.400]  Second Amendment. It's just an interesting parallel that's happening
[26:37.400 --> 26:42.640]  right now that we had this coin designed over six months ago, minted three
[26:42.640 --> 26:49.080]  weeks ago, delivered to our offices on Monday while the shooting is going on,
[26:49.080 --> 26:56.240]  in pulls the truck from the from the mint on the West Coast. And it is the third
[26:56.240 --> 27:01.120]  in the founder series of historic collectible coins to fund our operations
[27:01.120 --> 27:03.720]  in the next level what we're doing. And all the founding members that put their
[27:03.720 --> 27:07.000]  email in when you buy it will get special discounts, other special media
[27:07.000 --> 27:10.760]  events, films we're going to make, you're going to just get sent them free, all
[27:10.760 --> 27:14.120]  sorts of stuff if we're able to launch all this. If we get shut down, well,

[33:14.480 --> 33:21.440]  cover-ups you want to stop tyranny will so does he lie from the info wars.com
[33:21.440 --> 33:25.720]  studios it's alex jones
[33:25.720 --> 33:33.080]  here is the Texas State Police spokesperson saying that they didn't
[33:33.080 --> 33:36.280]  want to go in at the 12 minute shootout because they didn't know where he was
[33:36.280 --> 33:40.080]  they didn't want to get shot here it is that there was multiple officers that
[33:40.080 --> 33:44.160]  arrived on scene there was three officers that arrived they made entry at
[33:44.160 --> 33:47.360]  one of the entrances where the gunman actually made entrance to we had other
[33:47.360 --> 33:52.400]  another four officers that made entry at the other entrance of the school so
[33:52.400 --> 33:55.700]  there was officers inside that school as they were taking gunfire they were
[33:55.700 --> 34:02.440]  also calling in for reinforcement backup tactical teams snipers any additional
[34:02.440 --> 34:06.200]  personnel that could arrive to assist to not only with two with a situation but
[34:06.200 --> 34:11.520]  also to assist in evacuating students and teachers at that time that's when a
[34:11.520 --> 34:16.560]  US Border Patrol tactical officer arrived also with a Zavala County Sheriff's
[34:16.560 --> 34:22.120]  Deputy as well as two additional Uvalde Police Department officers were able to
[34:22.120 --> 34:27.400]  go into that classroom with a ballistic shield as cover and of course we know
[34:27.400 --> 34:31.520]  that one of those officers an agent actually was was shot was grazed on the
[34:31.520 --> 34:36.200]  top of the head but they were able to shoot and kill the suspect and preserve
[34:36.200 --> 34:39.440]  any other life we know that there was other injured children inside that
[34:39.440 --> 34:42.920]  classroom that they were able to save as well and get them to and get them to
[34:42.920 --> 34:46.840]  cover and at that point it became a recovery process a rescue operation
[34:46.840 --> 34:50.960]  trying to rescue the injured and also any other potential children or teachers
[34:50.960 --> 34:55.800]  that were inside those classrooms but don't current the best practices lieutenant
[34:55.800 --> 35:01.040]  call for officers to disable a shooter as quickly as possible regardless of how
[35:01.040 --> 35:08.000]  many officers are actually on site correct the active shooter situation you
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.160]  want to stop the killing you want to preserve life but also one thing that
[35:12.160 --> 35:16.240]  of course the American people need to understand is that officers are making
[35:16.240 --> 35:21.520]  entry into this building they do not know where the gunman is they're hearing
[35:21.520 --> 35:26.280]  gunshots they are they are receiving gunshots at that point if they if they
[35:26.280 --> 35:30.200]  proceeded any further not knowing where the suspect was at they could have been
[35:30.200 --> 35:32.680]  shot they could have been killed and at that point that gunman would have
[35:32.680 --> 35:36.920]  opportunity to kill other people inside that school so they were able to contain
[35:36.920 --> 35:41.880]  that gunman inside that classroom so that he was not able to go to any other
[35:41.880 --> 35:46.080]  portions of the school to commit any other killings your colleague at the
[35:46.080 --> 35:50.040]  Department of Public Safety lieutenant said the majority of the gunfire was
[35:50.040 --> 35:58.120]  actually done at the beginning does so there it is in context but they were in
[35:58.120 --> 36:01.920]  a 12-minute shootout outside and watched him go in the school unbelievable you
[36:01.920 --> 36:05.320]  know we're big supporters the men and women in law enforcement but when this
[36:05.320 --> 36:08.680]  kind of stuff goes on I took Carlson said last night we are being lied to
[36:08.680 --> 36:12.640]  about the whole thing and the fact that there was already a plan to mass shooting
[36:12.640 --> 36:16.800]  a few years ago this guy was known Ted Nugent I talked to him this morning was
[36:16.800 --> 36:20.840]  really on fire I want to just give him an opportunity to just kind of repeat
[36:20.840 --> 36:24.400]  what he said to me this morning and I appreciate him coming on here Ted Nugent
[36:24.400 --> 36:30.240]  well my pleasure Alex actually it's not my pleasure I have to call upon deep deep
[36:30.240 --> 36:36.120]  fortitude even discuss this heart wrenching topic right now the Nugent
[36:36.120 --> 36:41.080]  family is in solemn prayer for the victims and the entire you've all day
[36:41.080 --> 36:46.680]  community and quite honestly America because this is a manifestation of a
[36:46.680 --> 36:51.240]  cultural deprivation and abandonment of that warrior spirit and I'm not gonna
[36:51.240 --> 36:54.960]  condemn any law enforcement I'm not gonna come to any conclusions because the
[36:54.960 --> 36:59.000]  real horror that is critical thinkers which is the number one battle cry of
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.360]  Americans we the people should always be critically thinking we should be
[37:03.360 --> 37:09.640]  suspicious of every authority we should be suspicious of everybody and every
[37:09.640 --> 37:13.680]  info bit of information and as we can see right now there's kind of a cluster
[37:13.680 --> 37:17.880]  whack going on where the information seems to be changing every few minutes so
[37:17.880 --> 37:22.640]  let me just give an overview as a guitar player but also a law enforcement agent
[37:22.640 --> 37:26.600]  who has to qualify every year for the last 39 years a sheriff deputy of Lake
[37:26.600 --> 37:31.280]  County Michigan I've actually conducted federal raids and I haven't been fired
[37:31.280 --> 37:36.760]  upon so I can't speak honestly or accurately about the mindset of a
[37:36.760 --> 37:41.240]  warrior going in where rounds are being exchanged but I think we have to be
[37:41.240 --> 37:45.480]  extremely suspicious and extremely critical if we want to mitigate the
[37:45.480 --> 37:52.320]  circumstances glaring circumstances and information and evidence to stop this
[37:52.320 --> 37:57.000]  from ever happening again and all the calls I've been getting today Alex in
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.560]  fact for the last couple days are from SWAT commanders and SWAT guys I mean
[38:01.560 --> 38:07.600]  dedicated warriors these guys are gung-ho and since Columbine the training
[38:07.600 --> 38:13.800]  battle cry of law enforcement all across this country has been get the hell in
[38:13.800 --> 38:20.640]  there confront the shooter face-to-face close-quarter combat and neutralize them
[38:20.640 --> 38:26.240]  I gotta tell you Alex being a suspicious American rightly so in this
[38:26.240 --> 38:31.600]  horrible horrible treachery of 2022 where Uncle Sam is clearly the enemy of
[38:31.600 --> 38:35.960]  America and that breaks my heart to have to say that but the executive the
[38:35.960 --> 38:41.680]  legislative judicial branches they are now one big gang against the American
[38:41.680 --> 38:46.880]  dream against American families they benefit invaders they invent a benefit
[38:46.880 --> 38:51.120]  communist countries before they benefit America so that's the anger and the
[38:51.120 --> 38:55.120]  atmosphere that I'm speaking from right now and not just as the Ted Nugent
[38:55.120 --> 39:02.840]  father grandfather entrepreneur band leader guide hunting husband citizen
[39:02.840 --> 39:07.840]  I'm speaking on behalf of people who've been bombarding me going why the hell
[39:07.840 --> 39:15.440]  were they lingering outside the school and handcuffing parents and not charging
[39:15.440 --> 39:21.200]  into the fight and when I hear some law enforcement guys say well they were they
[39:21.200 --> 39:27.440]  were worried about getting shot Alex are you kidding me that's the whole pledge
[39:27.440 --> 39:33.200]  the whole oath that they take to charge in to save lives they're supposed to
[39:33.200 --> 39:37.200]  save innocent lives before they save their own lives and I know it's a
[39:37.200 --> 39:42.320]  Monday morning quarterback armchair enthusiast speaking but I know these
[39:42.320 --> 39:47.200]  guys you don't wait you don't wait for backup there's a number of dynamic
[39:47.200 --> 39:52.080]  dynamics going on here and I think we've got a push with all of our might
[39:52.080 --> 39:57.520]  regarding the uvalda incident there's all kinds of pre information that we're
[39:57.520 --> 40:02.120]  discounting there's all kinds of evidence from the past that we seem to be
[40:02.120 --> 40:06.440]  ignoring and discounting we need to get to the bottom of this because you're in
[40:06.440 --> 40:13.200]  my only goal a conscientious citizen of America's only goal what did we do wrong
[40:13.200 --> 40:19.760]  let's not ever do anything wrong again let's have quality control instead of
[40:19.760 --> 40:25.800]  scrambling for damage control the battle cry Alex by every law enforcement
[40:25.800 --> 40:31.440]  hero that I know is you don't wait for backup you get the hell in there and
[40:31.440 --> 40:36.960]  save children's lives case closed well that's right and when we talk this
[40:36.960 --> 40:40.520]  morning you wife and I that you were saying the same thing that you're being
[40:40.520 --> 40:44.600]  besieged by law enforcement buddies of yours their SWAT team guys everybody
[40:44.600 --> 40:48.040]  goes in constantly been shot at you name it so they've done it they're saying
[40:48.040 --> 40:54.760]  this was wrong that a lot of police are upset too and again we I side with you
[40:54.760 --> 40:59.880]  you know I've I have gone way out of my way all the way back into the beatnik
[40:59.880 --> 41:04.200]  and hippies days where they called cops pigs and I called the beatniks and the
[41:04.200 --> 41:09.160]  hippies pigs I've always stood shoulder to shoulder spirit to spirit quite
[41:09.160 --> 41:13.120]  honestly badge to badge with the law enforcement heroes I've had to rely on
[41:13.120 --> 41:18.400]  these guys to cover my back kicking down doors in Waco Texas at 3 a.m. arresting
[41:18.400 --> 41:23.480]  murders and rapists and in child sex traffickers I know the adrenaline that
[41:23.480 --> 41:30.600]  these guys go through and again I'm not a full-time SWAT guy but I understand the
[41:30.600 --> 41:35.120]  adrenaline I understand the fear and their number one goal is to get home to
[41:35.120 --> 41:39.240]  their family a law enforcement heroes number one goal is to get home to their
[41:39.240 --> 41:44.520]  family but when you have an active shooter in a school the number one goal
[41:44.520 --> 41:52.040]  becomes save the children and I'm afraid we give them the benefit of the doubt
[41:52.040 --> 41:56.960]  did they engage the shooter and did they save potential increased casualties
[41:56.960 --> 42:03.880]  okay yes and thank you for that but based on the squaloring from the parents
[42:03.880 --> 42:08.920]  who were on the scene we're not getting all the honest information here and we've
[42:08.920 --> 42:14.200]  got to demand honest information that's right and I don't trust the FBI that's
[42:14.200 --> 42:17.160]  now gotten all the footage and is in control of it we come back to a new
[42:17.160 --> 42:20.280]  gene I want to shift gears into the attack on the 2nd Amendment the bills

[47:34.520 --> 47:37.920]  guitarist in the great American Patriot you really care you've got skin in the
[47:37.920 --> 47:43.960]  game you fight all the time long before with Tucker Carlson or Alex Jones or
[47:43.960 --> 47:48.640]  even Rush Limbaugh my god since this late 60s you have been out there and I'm
[47:48.640 --> 47:50.960]  just giving praise where it's due more American should emulate what you're
[47:50.960 --> 47:54.320]  doing you're really frustrated and angry I think this morning talking to you I've
[47:54.320 --> 47:59.280]  never heard you more angry and I was using some expletive as well there's so
[47:59.280 --> 48:03.120]  much I want to hit here but what about the political attack the move against the
[48:03.120 --> 48:08.360]  guns and the attack on the NRA convention in Houston this weekend well
[48:08.360 --> 48:15.080]  as as you've known I've always been at the in the vortex the whirlwind of the
[48:15.080 --> 48:19.920]  freedom debate in the world of entertainment because they have to take
[48:19.920 --> 48:24.120]  the devil's advocacy point of view to debate me because I'm Michael the
[48:24.120 --> 48:27.720]  archangel with truth logic common sense and all the evidence to support
[48:27.720 --> 48:31.680]  everything I stand for everything I believe in everything I say the way I
[48:31.680 --> 48:36.280]  live truth logic and common sense and typically a leftist interview ago well
[48:36.280 --> 48:40.960]  let me play devil's advocate well to debate Ted Nugent you're gonna have to
[48:40.960 --> 48:45.960]  take the side of the devil because I'm right and they're wrong and let's just
[48:45.960 --> 48:50.120]  put it in perspective in the debate of self-defense thank god that there was a
[48:50.120 --> 48:56.520]  jury and a court and a judge that sided with the purity of self-defense in the
[48:56.520 --> 49:01.320]  Kyle Rittenhouse case up in Wisconsin thank god we have an indicator that
[49:01.320 --> 49:05.640]  truth logic and common sense and the value of good life over evil life is
[49:05.640 --> 49:10.920]  not it's not extinct it's not extinct it's still alive and well so let's take
[49:10.920 --> 49:18.280]  on the ultimate representative of the anti-self-defense the the the devaluing
[49:18.280 --> 49:24.680]  of the sacred gift of life from God Beto punk ass or orc let's just use that guy
[49:24.680 --> 49:29.960]  as the ultimate spokesman him and Michael Moore what how perfect is the
[49:29.960 --> 49:34.440]  debate surrounded by bodyguards surrounded by bodyguards they want our
[49:34.440 --> 49:40.240]  guns as but here's the point and here's what I bring up on these interviews I do
[49:40.240 --> 49:47.640]  every day so do you think that Kalishnikov's are banned in Paris France do
[49:47.640 --> 49:54.160]  you think a citizen of France can get a gun do you think the banning of guns by
[49:54.160 --> 50:01.520]  French citizens has done any good when actual Kalishnikov's real AK-47s machine
[50:01.520 --> 50:08.600]  guns were used in Paris France to attack a rock and roll concert how did that ban
[50:08.600 --> 50:14.800]  work out and in Waukesha Wisconsin how about an SUV mowing down innocent people
[50:14.800 --> 50:21.520]  how about in in Florida a guy in a semi tractor trailer mowing down dozens and
[50:21.520 --> 50:27.760]  dozens of people as if it's about hardware as if it's about methodology
[50:27.760 --> 50:34.200]  it's about the the spiritual cancer that have been fanning the flames here in
[50:34.200 --> 50:39.960]  America where God has been abandoned discipline is now illegal real parenting
[50:39.960 --> 50:46.200]  is considered a terrorist activity so yes I'm very angry because I see my
[50:46.200 --> 50:51.360]  government turning on the people where the media is just a guaranteed source
[50:51.360 --> 50:58.640]  of lies and hate and that fact checkers are absolute mindless soulless hating
[50:58.640 --> 51:06.200]  liars so we've seen the twisting of the American dream where evil runs our
[51:06.200 --> 51:13.800]  country where Walt Disney has turned into an arm of Satan and we're right is
[51:13.800 --> 51:19.080]  wrong up is down black is white and good is evil so yes I'm angry because I'm a
[51:19.080 --> 51:22.560]  father and a grandfather and a parent and a landowner and a hard-working
[51:22.560 --> 51:28.680]  American and I represent the best of the best that's why the worst of the worst
[51:28.680 --> 51:35.640]  come after me Beto O'Rourke debate me you punk Michael Moore debate me I'll even
[51:35.640 --> 51:40.160]  supply you a washcloth and soap and explain what soap is to Michael Moore
[51:40.160 --> 51:45.840]  Michael Moore is a demon Beto O'Rourke is a stone skateboarding hippie they
[51:45.840 --> 51:50.600]  represent the anti-gun side which means they're against self-defense they're
[51:50.600 --> 51:55.800]  against God-given individual rights debate me you punks come on the Alex
[51:55.800 --> 52:00.200]  Jones show or the Ted Nugent spirit campfire and debate me I'll do to you
[52:00.200 --> 52:05.840]  what I did to Pierce Morgan and everybody else I'll crush you and you
[52:05.840 --> 52:09.800]  know the thing about it Ted is you're alive I'm alive my family's alive I get
[52:09.800 --> 52:13.480]  around left this are like dead zombies that's why freedom is so amazing
[52:13.480 --> 52:18.360]  statistically it makes sense financially it makes sense spiritually but just the
[52:18.360 --> 52:24.880]  fire in your eyes is exciting it's true and why don't and we're winning we're
[52:24.880 --> 52:28.880]  winning the second movement debate statistics all show or we're winning
[52:28.880 --> 52:33.800]  the the abortion debate we're winning that's why the left is so upset and it's
[52:33.800 --> 52:37.000]  trying to overthrow everything and start a civil war because they know they've
[52:37.000 --> 52:41.000]  lost I know I don't believe that the pendulum is starting to swing back
[52:41.000 --> 52:47.760]  they're trying to hold that back you can't hold fate back Ted Nugent Alex let
[52:47.760 --> 52:54.160]  me emphasize it in the most glaringly obvious way Lee Greenwood great great
[52:54.160 --> 53:00.040]  patriot he abandoned the number one civil rights or organization the family
[53:00.040 --> 53:05.520]  grassroots civil rights organization of the NRA because of a shooting in
[53:05.520 --> 53:09.840]  Uvalde Lee Greenwood won't sing his patriotic music at the civil rights
[53:09.840 --> 53:15.160]  organization of the NRA is a virtually the virtue signaling crime let's
[53:15.160 --> 53:18.840]  elaborate on that the country was founded when the Brits came to take the
[53:18.840 --> 53:24.080]  guns he knows that a lovely Greenwilled and you bring that up explain this he
[53:24.080 --> 53:31.480]  is abandoning the NRA event this is disgusting it's it's really the scourge
[53:31.480 --> 53:38.800]  the spiritual suicide of political correctness what in God's name does a
[53:38.800 --> 53:44.560]  civil rights organization that stands up for self-defense and good over evil
[53:44.560 --> 53:47.880]  that's the National Rifle Association I know these members I got the highest
[53:47.880 --> 53:52.240]  votes ever I think for like 29 years on the board of directors because I'm an
[53:52.240 --> 53:57.000]  absolutist I get to keep and bear arms not because a man gave me a license but
[53:57.000 --> 54:00.640]  God gave me that right and the founding fathers wrote it down shortly after
[54:00.640 --> 54:05.640]  Concord Bridge Lee Greenwood what is wrong with you Don McClean what is
[54:05.640 --> 54:09.520]  wrong with you why would you abandon the performance in a civil rights of
[54:09.520 --> 54:14.000]  organization because of a crime what to the good families of the National
[54:14.000 --> 54:17.840]  Rifle Association what to the tens of millions hundreds of millions of good
[54:17.840 --> 54:22.720]  law-abiding gun owner families in America what do they have to do with some
[54:22.720 --> 54:27.000]  evil punk shooting children and I'll tell you what we have to do with them
[54:27.000 --> 54:33.000]  nothing we stand against evil the NRA and gun owners of America we stand
[54:33.000 --> 54:38.760]  against evil but Lee Greenwood and Don McClean has abandoned a civil rights
[54:38.760 --> 54:42.600]  organization that stands up for the sanctity of life and defending one's
[54:42.600 --> 54:47.160]  life for what reason I'd love to hear what Lee would say well why would you
[54:47.160 --> 54:51.280]  not join us chosen aside they believe the globals are gonna take over they
[54:51.280 --> 54:54.760]  don't want to be censored and they have signed on it's it's disgusting that is
[54:54.760 --> 54:59.600]  he's such a good person his song so great that he has now decided to cower at
[54:59.600 --> 55:03.440]  this point and act like our right to defend ourselves and what we do
[55:03.440 --> 55:08.480]  individually like you said the Kenosha guy uses a car is Lee Greenwood gonna
[55:08.480 --> 55:13.520]  come out against cars or trucks or SUVs to somebody use an SUV for a crime it's
[55:13.520 --> 55:18.680]  preposterous and I hate to come off so angry but I can't help it because I'm
[55:18.680 --> 55:23.240]  really angry because political correctness is basically a mindless
[55:23.240 --> 55:29.360]  soulless cult of denial and again the National Rifle Association members are
[55:29.360 --> 55:34.800]  the best families in the world we stand on the side of law and order we stand
[55:34.800 --> 55:39.320]  on the side and fight and demand our right to self-defense because if good
[55:39.320 --> 55:44.600]  people cannot keep and bear arms to defend ourselves then the evil engineered
[55:44.600 --> 55:52.160]  recidivistic monsters will do with us as they please Spokane Seattle Portland
[55:52.160 --> 55:59.960]  Houston Detroit Baltimore Chicago if you're unarmed and helpless evil loves
[55:59.960 --> 56:03.720]  you because they're gonna do what they damn well please and if you're unarmed
[56:03.720 --> 56:08.040]  and helpless you're irresponsible because you're rolling out the red carpet
[56:08.040 --> 56:12.960]  for evil and our government and our court system guarantees you will walk
[56:12.960 --> 56:18.680]  the streets of America with evil violent criminals because our court system has
[56:18.680 --> 56:23.480]  completely failed they try to defund the police and then they try to eliminate
[56:23.480 --> 56:29.200]  our right to keep a bear arms to defend ourselves that is the goal of the devil
[56:29.200 --> 56:33.860]  and we must crush the devil that's right the final piece is while they have
[56:33.860 --> 56:38.800]  private security paid for by taxpayers incredible I believe Ted Nugent I've
[56:38.800 --> 56:42.320]  known you for 20 years at least and I've known you and I've been watching for 40
[56:42.320 --> 56:46.760]  listen to you for longer but man you I've never seen you show focus on fire I
[56:46.760 --> 56:51.040]  think you realize we all realize we are we are entering the real crossroads

[59:49.160 --> 1:00:11.040]  all right the press conference is live right now while Ted Nugent's on with
[1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:15.480]  us and we're grabbing the clip we'll have a next segment after he's gone
[1:00:15.480 --> 1:00:20.720]  Roger Stone joining us next segment but the Evaldi school district chief of
[1:00:20.720 --> 1:00:26.920]  police has admitted that they ordered the stand down they had the jurisdiction
[1:00:26.920 --> 1:00:31.800]  and told the state police border patrol and local police not to go in he just
[1:00:31.800 --> 1:00:35.120]  admitted on TV they're getting the clip right now it's breaking all over the
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:39.720]  news right now disgusting absolutely disgusting the police should have been
[1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:42.960]  like those parents that refused and went in some of them and saved their kids
[1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:45.920]  Ted Nugent that's breaking now what's your view on this we knew there was a
[1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:50.040]  stand down now it's confirmed this morning you asked me Alex I'm searching
[1:00:50.040 --> 1:00:53.800]  everywhere was there a stand down is there we talked about that I said I
[1:00:53.800 --> 1:00:59.080]  don't know yet now they admitted Ted what you were saying well first of all I
[1:00:59.080 --> 1:01:04.720]  have to establish that I'm not an observer I'm not a spectator in the
[1:01:04.720 --> 1:01:09.400]  American dream I'm a participant I hunt in you've all day every year I know the
[1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:14.160]  mayor Don I know those cops down there I know the sporting goods people I know
[1:01:14.160 --> 1:01:19.480]  the local barbecue people I know the local coffee shop people I have a real
[1:01:19.480 --> 1:01:24.040]  human connection with those people and you know talk about Buffalo I know Buffalo
[1:01:24.040 --> 1:01:29.360]  I've been rock and roll in Buffalo since 1967 I have dear dear connections with
[1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:34.360]  Americans all across this country so when a tragedy strikes it touches me very
[1:01:34.360 --> 1:01:40.360]  deeply and very personally what we're finding out is that the battle cry
[1:01:40.360 --> 1:01:45.640]  following Columbine and Parkland and Sandy Hook in every instance that
[1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:50.080]  training up because I train with these guys the training is the sound of gun
[1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:55.200]  fire go go go go go get in there get in there because we're talking about
[1:01:55.200 --> 1:02:03.280]  sitting ducks helpless innocent little boys and girls that have no sense of
[1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:08.280]  self-defense no sense of survival they're basically still developing no
[1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:13.280]  idea I was at my my five-year-old daughter's graduation from she turned
[1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:16.840]  five last week and I just was watching these little kids I couldn't imagine he
[1:02:16.840 --> 1:02:23.000]  would do this it's us as men that are supposed to protect them you know I was
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  on an anniversary jaunt with Mrs. Nugent the Queen of the Forest the greatest
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:32.120]  woman walking the earth and Shaman and I were in a taxi cabin in Miami I'll make
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:36.160]  this real brief and we witnessed an altercation between a couple guys in a
[1:02:36.160 --> 1:02:39.720]  pickup in a small vehicle the guys in the pickup attack the guy in the small
[1:02:39.720 --> 1:02:44.600]  vehicle in rush hour there in Miami Beach and all of a sudden we saw a badge
[1:02:44.600 --> 1:02:50.000]  and a gun come out of the victim's pouch and the two guys were beating him to
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:55.840]  death I immediately got Shaman behind the wheel of the taxi cab I cleared my
[1:02:55.840 --> 1:03:02.960]  my gun and I charged into it now I again I'm not a hero I'm not a warrior I'm
[1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:07.520]  just a husband and a father who knows that when you see evil you must attempt
[1:03:07.520 --> 1:03:13.000]  to neutralize the evil because I had a gun and because I've been trained my
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:17.120]  instincts kicked in I could see these guys were prying the pistol out of the
[1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:21.320]  off-duty cops hands and the viciousness of their attack would have certainly
[1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:27.640]  escalated into murder I knew it but I didn't hesitate as a goofy guitar player
[1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:33.600]  I just charged into it I whipped out my sheriff credentials and with Detroit
[1:03:33.600 --> 1:03:38.320]  Venom coming out of my eyeballs I neutralize the situation without having
[1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:44.160]  to discharge my weapon so I understand to some degree the threat and the danger
[1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:48.560]  and the adrenaline and the fear so I'm not speaking just as a spectator I'm
[1:03:48.560 --> 1:03:53.000]  speaking as a participant who was tuned into self-defense to protect myself in
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:04:00.920]  the arena absolutely so so I understand the hesitancy instinctively but again
[1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:09.920]  since all the school shootings Alex get the hell in there and if you haven't got
[1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:13.120]  a long gun you're gonna have to go in with your side arm you're gonna have to
[1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:18.480]  use the best tactics you can possibly employ but you need to confront the
[1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:24.760]  evil and neutralize it and if you get shot in the process I'm sorry that's the
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:29.080]  job description you've got to do it so I'm waiting to find here the final
[1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:34.080]  details I'm not condemning anybody but I'm asking questions I'm considering
[1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:39.240]  alternative scenarios and until we find out what actually happened and where the
[1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:45.080]  failures were we will have to experience this again if anybody hesitates to

[1:06:20.200 --> 1:06:27.320]  studios it's Alex Jones. Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight two
[1:06:27.320 --> 1:06:31.600]  days ago as you know a mentally ill teenager called Salvador Ramos murdered
[1:06:31.600 --> 1:06:36.360]  19 children and two teachers in an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas the
[1:06:36.360 --> 1:06:40.440]  crime was so awful so completely unimaginable and shocking that it was
[1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:44.240]  about 24 hours before most people thought to ask exactly what had happened
[1:06:44.240 --> 1:06:48.480]  how was Ramos able to get inside the school why did no one stop him as he
[1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:52.480]  methodically executed so many children over about an hour where was law
[1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:55.960]  enforcement those aren't just fair questions though they are they're
[1:06:55.960 --> 1:07:00.120]  essential questions if you want to prevent similar atrocities you need
[1:07:00.120 --> 1:07:03.600]  details you've got to find out what exactly happened this is a well-known
[1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:07.440]  concept every time a commercial airliner crashes in this country federal
[1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:11.440]  investigators painstakingly recreate the final moments of the flight not because
[1:07:11.440 --> 1:07:15.880]  they're ghoulish they want to know what caused it and that's the main reason that
[1:07:15.880 --> 1:07:21.240]  air travel is so safe after action reports work yet somehow our leaders
[1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:26.000]  rarely respond as rationally to violent crime almost never a mass shooting is
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:30.040]  just too tempting a moment for them to demagogue the public is often grieving
[1:07:30.040 --> 1:07:34.440]  and in shock so it's the perfect moment for the usual opportunists to leap forward
[1:07:34.440 --> 1:07:38.040]  and cast blame on their political opponents to seize all the power they
[1:07:38.040 --> 1:07:42.240]  can while the country's too traumatized to notice you almost hear never hear
[1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:46.880]  anyone in washington asked what happened and said it's always a race to see you
[1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:51.880]  can benefit politically this week was no different within hours of Tuesday's
[1:07:51.880 --> 1:07:54.880]  massacre democrats in congress announced they planned to clamp down on your
[1:07:54.880 --> 1:07:58.520]  ability to defend yourself for the firearm why is that well apparently the
[1:07:58.520 --> 1:08:02.320]  uvaldi shooting was your fault so you're gonna pay the price the media
[1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:06.240]  applauded this so democrats went even farther yesterday they unveiled their
[1:08:06.240 --> 1:08:10.480]  plan to seize firearms for american citizens who have not been convicted of
[1:08:10.480 --> 1:08:14.600]  a crime we've been accused no under normal circumstances it would be
[1:08:14.600 --> 1:08:18.480]  instantly obvious that that is unconstitutional our system you have to
[1:08:18.480 --> 1:08:21.480]  be convicted
[1:08:26.760 --> 1:08:32.120]  you can look at it from any perspective you can slice it and dice it however you
[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:39.000]  want the situation unfolding in this country is dire and the world war
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:46.040]  inflation collapsing borders but last night I called Roger Stone he couldn't
[1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:49.680]  answer the phone he texted me back and I said you know you got rated by 20 plus
[1:08:49.680 --> 1:08:54.280]  SWAT team agents with CNN there over supposedly lying to Congress which
[1:08:54.280 --> 1:08:58.800]  turned out to not be true but they don't have agents for the border and they
[1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:01.960]  don't have agents for what happened to school we know those are federal agents
[1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:07.120]  the point is they are absolutely politically targeting the American
[1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:11.680]  people and now we learn that the main FBI agent that arrested Roger Stone and
[1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:18.200]  perp walked him is in the Durham-Sussman trial and it's coming out that he knew
[1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:23.480]  rushing it was fake and admitted that it knew it was a fraud so what a what a
[1:09:23.480 --> 1:09:29.640]  confluence or a alignment of facts and issues here so I want to get Roger
[1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:34.560]  Stone's take first on the mass shooting and what's coming out of it and then
[1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:40.720]  this FBI agent that was part of the raid on his home and now the fact that he's
[1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:44.480]  in the hot seat what a vindication Roger Stone thank you so much for joining
[1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:50.880]  us Alex it's great to be back here you know maybe I know maybe I'm just
[1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:56.600]  sentimental going into this Memorial Day weekend but I can honestly say that the
[1:09:56.600 --> 1:10:01.800]  happiest time in my life was when I was doing a daily show on Info Wars and
[1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:07.320]  where everything that is unfolding now in a DC courtroom preceding my stunning
[1:10:07.320 --> 1:10:12.240]  arrest which people looking at right now every single thing we said right here
[1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:18.560]  on Info Wars has turned out to be true the entire rushing collusion hoax was a
[1:10:18.560 --> 1:10:23.360]  fabrication that went all the way to Hillary Clinton she authorized it she
[1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:30.400]  knew about it and the real question seems to me after the trial in DC
[1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:35.520]  unleashes bombshell after bombshell is why is Mr. Durham going for the low
[1:10:35.520 --> 1:10:41.200]  hanging fruit in other words Sussman Michael Sussman the Clinton attorney
[1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:49.040]  appears to me to be a patsy a fall guy the sacrificial lamb witness after
[1:10:49.040 --> 1:10:56.720]  witness after witness unloads on him Mark Elias Robbie MOOC they haven't called
[1:10:56.720 --> 1:11:01.240]  John Podesta yet but they certainly should they have all confirmed this was a
[1:11:01.240 --> 1:11:06.000]  conspiracy they've all confirmed the Hillary Clinton personally approved it
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:12.720]  so the real question is why hasn't Mr. Durham gone any higher up the totem pole
[1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:19.360]  and then as you point out stunningly the same FBI agent who orchestrated the
[1:11:19.360 --> 1:11:26.400]  raid on my home the same FBI agent who took me into custody the same FBI agent
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:30.800]  who refused to move the handcuffs from behind my back when riding in the car
[1:11:30.800 --> 1:11:36.060]  to the front so that I could actually sit upright that guy knew as early as
[1:11:36.060 --> 1:11:41.820]  2016 based on his testimony that the Russian collusion hoax was banged was
[1:11:41.820 --> 1:11:47.120]  bunk so he knew he had an innocent man
[1:11:47.560 --> 1:11:52.480]  absolutely true he and he and what's more interesting is he knew the alpha bank
[1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:58.720]  the Russian bank accusation regarding Donald Trump was fabricated he knew that
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:04.440]  that the steel dossier and the crowd strikes report the other two big pieces
[1:12:04.440 --> 1:12:10.360]  of evidence fabricated evidence as it turns out that Mueller and the Justice
[1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:15.040]  Department and the FBI depended on all came from the same source yet he
[1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:22.400]  willingly ran a 1.1 million dollar raid on my home and now we learn that he's
[1:12:22.400 --> 1:12:28.680]  under investigation because it appears that he fabricated evidence in both the
[1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:34.680]  case of George Papadopoulos and the case of Carter Page two other Trump
[1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:39.920]  supporters who were prosecuted so it's good for the goose is good for the
[1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:44.320]  gander and it shows these fools that involve themselves in political
[1:12:44.320 --> 1:12:50.840]  anti-American prosecutions that they'll be thrown away later well you know the
[1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:56.160]  sad part is it remains to be seen so FBI agent Curtis Heidi that's the guy we're
[1:12:56.160 --> 1:13:00.480]  talking about here he admitted on the stand that he's under internal FBI
[1:13:00.480 --> 1:13:05.720]  investigation but what will be the fruits of that investigation in other words my
[1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:09.960]  life was turned upside down I lost my show on info wars had to give up my
[1:13:09.960 --> 1:13:17.160]  syndicated radio show I lost my home my car my savings my freedom to travel my
[1:13:17.160 --> 1:13:23.320]  freedom to speak as you know as a kind of PTSD a parting gift from Mueller and
[1:13:23.320 --> 1:13:27.940]  his thugs my wife was diagnosed with stage four cancer which through the
[1:13:27.940 --> 1:13:32.240]  grace of God and the healing power of Jesus Christ she has survived but that
[1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:37.840]  was all all a gift from these criminals and now their criminality is being
[1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:42.360]  openly exposed that right there on the screen is agent Heidi right behind me
[1:13:42.360 --> 1:13:49.000]  he's the one who slapped the cuffs on me it's just incredible so so obviously
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.800]  everybody knows you're not a Russian agent I'm not everybody knows we're
[1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:55.200]  pro-america no one buys that our audience like yeah don't tell us not
[1:13:55.200 --> 1:13:58.800]  Russians we know we believe you believe your Americans
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:05.880]  I just don't know it shows we get it but what does it mean that it's confirmed
[1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:09.400]  Hillary ordered it knew it was a fraud that's all come out in court if they
[1:14:09.400 --> 1:14:15.360]  don't prosecute her now this just discredits the FBI even more yeah well
[1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:20.760]  first of all we we openly confess a love of Russian vodka and we make no bones
[1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:26.200]  about exactly and you and I have enjoyed some Russian vodka together and if
[1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:31.360]  that's a crime well then we're guilty but to be absolutely clear I think that
[1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:35.680]  this demonstrates the entire politicization of our judicial system I
[1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:40.120]  mean I had a corrupted judge who was couldn't hide her hatred for Donald
[1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:44.920]  Trump or for me who went out of her mind when you covered the trial as if you had
[1:14:44.920 --> 1:14:49.200]  no right Alex to comment on it just as she attacked you from the bench she
[1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:54.320]  attacked Tucker Carlson from the bench she attacked anybody who questioned her
[1:14:54.320 --> 1:15:00.920]  insane bias rulings I had a jury forewoman who in 2019 was attacking me
[1:15:00.920 --> 1:15:05.720]  on social media well we'll take it up on the other side that's right Roger Stone
[1:15:05.720 --> 1:15:11.240]  here we'll talk about Trump and the midterms coming up in 165 days what
[1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:17.000]  these primaries signify is it a win for America is it a is it a wash we'll get
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:21.240]  Roger Stones take on all of that on the other side please remember listeners we

[1:20:17.840 --> 1:20:22.120]  while you were sleeping
[1:20:22.120 --> 1:20:32.040]  they came and took it all away Roger Stone, Herschel Walker, MTG, so many others
[1:20:32.040 --> 1:20:37.640]  won some Trump candidates lost what do you make of the primaries that just
[1:20:37.640 --> 1:20:43.360]  happened what does that forebode for these critical midterms 165 days out?
[1:20:43.360 --> 1:20:48.800]  well let's remember that President Trump took JD Vance who was in fourth place at
[1:20:48.800 --> 1:20:53.840]  the time of his endorsement catapulted him to victory we're not certain about
[1:20:53.840 --> 1:20:58.760]  the outcome of Pennsylvania but it appears that his preferred candidate who
[1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:03.600]  was hardly the perfect profile as a MAGA candidate came from nowhere to prevail
[1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:08.680]  there. President's track record is very strong I can tell you looking at
[1:21:08.680 --> 1:21:15.960]  sophisticated polling data in California, Oklahoma, Nevada, Pennsylvania, New
[1:21:15.960 --> 1:21:22.760]  Jersey, Louisiana that 70 rough percent of the Republican voters are more
[1:21:22.760 --> 1:21:29.280]  likely to vote for a candidate endorsed by Donald Trump. The rhinos I think are
[1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:36.000]  on the run overall and I think he is going to continue to be strong I do
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:41.720]  need to say however that this entire January 6th narrative a false narrative
[1:21:41.720 --> 1:21:45.920]  is the only thing the Democrats really have in an effort to undermine Trump
[1:21:45.920 --> 1:21:51.480]  going into the 2022 elections in other words they can't talk about gasoline
[1:21:51.480 --> 1:21:56.000]  prices they can't talk about the abundance in the supermarkets they
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:00.840]  can't talk about the strength of the dollar because inflation crippling
[1:22:00.840 --> 1:22:05.000]  inflation is destroying the buying power of the dollar and hurting American
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:11.120]  families they appeared to me to have staged some kind of an event in Texas my
[1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:15.120]  heart goes out to those 19 children and the families of the two teachers who
[1:22:15.120 --> 1:22:19.520]  were killed but as Tucker Carlson points out the more you look the closer you
[1:22:19.520 --> 1:22:24.320]  look you wonder how this could have happened and I don't agree with those
[1:22:24.320 --> 1:22:29.560]  who say oh we need to take away all guns that's the answer no people cause crime
[1:22:29.560 --> 1:22:35.000]  guns don't cause crime Alex I'm just gonna say this this morning one of my
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:40.120]  attorneys was attacked contacted by someone from CNN wanting us to comment
[1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:44.080]  on the fact wanting to know whether we had heard that Alex Jones was had now
[1:22:44.080 --> 1:22:48.880]  become a federal witness and we'd be testifying against others regarding
[1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:54.720]  January 6th now I know this is entirely false because I spoke to you but that's
[1:22:54.720 --> 1:23:00.040]  the kind of game that they play here Alex Jones and Roger Stone did nothing
[1:23:00.040 --> 1:23:05.560]  wrong on January 6th and anyone who makes any assertion claim or even implies
[1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:10.320]  otherwise that's categorically false and there's no evidence to back it up
[1:23:10.320 --> 1:23:13.840]  well Roger let's elaborate on that little I mean let's elaborate the oldest
[1:23:13.840 --> 1:23:18.000]  tactic in the book by corrupt prosecutors whether it's here other countries is to
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:22.520]  call people saying Alex Jones or whoever it is is gonna spill the beans on you so
[1:23:22.520 --> 1:23:26.960]  the article's been running for two weeks total BS the New York Times called my
[1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:31.680]  lawyer up and said we hear the feds contact you and we said yeah and we said
[1:23:31.680 --> 1:23:36.520]  give us immunity there's no information no pre-planning no attack on the
[1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:40.720]  Capitol but if you give us immunity so there's not a Martha Stewart situation
[1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:44.600]  where they claim he lied under oath second make whatever they want then we
[1:23:44.600 --> 1:23:49.320]  might talk to you that turns into Jones is spilling the beans and it's gonna
[1:23:49.320 --> 1:23:54.940]  expose Holly Alexander and and Roger Stone it's totally made up and then we
[1:23:54.940 --> 1:23:58.560]  called the feds everything said we're not talking to you now that's it you
[1:23:58.560 --> 1:24:02.280]  obviously leaked that to the press we're done talking to you you know what really
[1:24:02.280 --> 1:24:05.640]  happened you had over a thousand undercover FBI it's come out in the news
[1:24:05.640 --> 1:24:12.520]  there that day and you stood down while we tried to stop it that's exactly
[1:24:12.520 --> 1:24:16.200]  right but I look I couldn't help but take this opportunity to clear the air
[1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:20.880]  here I know Alex Jones I've known him since the 50th anniversary of the
[1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:24.840]  Kennedy assassination not only has he done nothing wrong but he's not testifying
[1:24:24.840 --> 1:24:29.480]  against anybody because there's nothing in our knowledge to testify against or
[1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:35.440]  about this this is the oldest tactic in the book to try to get people to lie
[1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:40.320]  under oaths to save their own skin I know of no crimes that were committed
[1:24:40.320 --> 1:24:44.720]  that day by my direct knowledge I was in touch with you throughout the day I
[1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:50.680]  know you don't either but but if you see the stunning report from CNN in the
[1:24:50.680 --> 1:24:57.280]  next 24 hours it's bunk folks it's false Alex Jones is a patriot and not
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:01.320]  testifying against anybody because there's nothing to testify against they
[1:25:01.320 --> 1:25:06.160]  called us a week ago we sent a message saying this story is false there is
[1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:10.360]  there is no crimes to talk about we're not coming into the FBI I mean we sent
[1:25:10.360 --> 1:25:14.480]  a message especially that so again it's all lies so I guess I didn't know about
[1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:17.360]  this we haven't talked we talked on texture say about the shooting I didn't
[1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:21.400]  know they contact you so they're getting ready for some big story well it's very
[1:25:21.400 --> 1:25:25.840]  hard to say I mean they got vehement denials from us because I know this not
[1:25:25.840 --> 1:25:30.760]  to be true but in the meantime three people who work for me have now been
[1:25:30.760 --> 1:25:36.400]  subpoenaed to the January 6th committee they don't know anything either I think
[1:25:36.400 --> 1:25:39.760]  they all asserted their Fifth Amendment rights although I'm not even certain
[1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:45.160]  about that they consulted with their own attorneys made their own decisions but
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:50.200]  but this this is a this is a demented narrative that just because President
[1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:54.240]  Donald Trump exercised his First Amendment rights and the rest of us
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:59.200]  exercised our Fourth Amendment rights to gather peacefully in DC that we are
[1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:03.800]  somehow in violation of the law as if questioning the outcome of the election
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:08.200]  or trying to convince the Electoral College as Hillary did in 2016 to delay
[1:26:08.200 --> 1:26:12.560]  their certification until the results in some of the swing states could be more
[1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:17.760]  carefully examined for fraud is seditious treasonous well Roger we know
[1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:22.160]  what's happening they've got the 2,000 mules there's new gateway punitive video
[1:26:22.160 --> 1:26:27.320]  same scams in Michigan Pennsylvania they don't want us questioning when they
[1:26:27.320 --> 1:26:30.800]  try to steal it again and so we've gotten the calls hell I've already seen the
[1:26:30.800 --> 1:26:35.040]  articles in the last few weeks Jones is gonna expose Trump Jones is gonna I
[1:26:35.040 --> 1:26:38.040]  didn't talk to Trump for over a year before this happened Trump didn't
[1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:42.480]  direct us it's all a lie so when people see Jones is a stool pigeon Jones is
[1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:49.680]  gonna expose it all it is 100% a fraud and a lie and burn in hell those that
[1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:56.160]  are saying it it is 100% cut and dry that's precisely one of why I wanted to
[1:26:56.160 --> 1:27:00.960]  bring it up and clear the air because people call me for like a stick on in
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:05.360]  a month saying well you're here you what we do anything wrong we call the feds
[1:27:05.360 --> 1:27:09.680]  I'm not they've been wanting to meet with me we said we've done nothing we know
[1:27:09.680 --> 1:27:13.400]  nothing give me immunity I'll talk to you but there's no information that's not
[1:27:13.400 --> 1:27:18.200]  calling the feds when they are calling you well not only that but but their
[1:27:18.200 --> 1:27:23.520]  purposes are absolutely naked if we can get Jones under oath and ask him whether
[1:27:23.520 --> 1:27:26.640]  he had a club sandwich and whether he remembers whether it was mustard or
[1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:31.320]  mayonnaise maybe we can twist something he says into a crime look I'm the
[1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:36.160]  poster child for this tactic okay I testified before the Congress I wasn't
[1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:40.640]  even subpoena I went voluntarily yeah I made misstatements but none of them were
[1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:44.120]  material or relevant or hit any underlying crime
[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:49.920]  nonetheless I was charged I was put before a Soviet style show trial and they
[1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:55.000]  wanted to give me seven to nine years in prison for a misstatement that was
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:59.240]  irrelevant that was innocuous and the guy who did it's right there over my
[1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:04.080]  shoulder Curtis Heidi who took me into custody at a time that he knew that these
[1:28:04.080 --> 1:28:08.920]  were fabricated charges so that's why they want to interview Alex Jones that's
[1:28:08.920 --> 1:28:12.920]  why they want to intervene interview Roger Stone not because we know something
[1:28:12.920 --> 1:28:17.760]  not because we did something wrong but to try to twist this somehow into a
[1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:21.520]  process crime Roger the listeners know that they're sick of hearing it but
[1:28:21.520 --> 1:28:25.440]  they're running on this this is the big issue they're gonna pull something else
[1:28:25.440 --> 1:28:28.920]  with January 6th I got the hearings coming up next month we'll be covering

[1:32:22.120 --> 1:32:26.040]  taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing and I was

[1:38:51.600 --> 1:38:57.240]  the truth and telling the truth is a hard thing you know so many people lie
[1:38:57.240 --> 1:39:03.600]  because it's easy just to make stuff up I dedicate myself five six hours a day
[1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:09.040]  I've wrecked my family doing this on top of the show on top of everything and I'm
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:11.800]  not bitching I'm not a victim I'm not like oh aren't you lucky know me you
[1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:17.160]  can't drag me away from this but I'm up at 2 a.m. reading documents and once I
[1:39:17.160 --> 1:39:22.200]  get on it or time to hit it all because I want to know the enemy I want to know
[1:39:22.200 --> 1:39:27.200]  what my enemy's doing I'm mad I'm beyond mad they're doing this to us to you to
[1:39:27.200 --> 1:39:33.920]  me I I have a will to defeat them I I've seen that the the systems of victory I
[1:39:33.920 --> 1:39:41.400]  know where we can go I've I've been inspired by God just like you have so
[1:39:41.400 --> 1:39:48.120]  it's not my job to attack the police randomly to curry favor with a leftist
[1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:52.960]  media you know if you go back to YouTube 20 years ago when it's first started
[1:39:52.960 --> 1:39:58.920]  18 years ago I didn't know why a video about the Federal Reserve or a video
[1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:04.000]  about world government or a video about GMO would get blocked and censored we
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:08.040]  get shadow banned well that was just invented five years ago I learned to
[1:40:08.040 --> 1:40:14.760]  the process but when I did a video showing a bad cop doing something wrong
[1:40:14.760 --> 1:40:18.320]  they would promote it they wouldn't block it it would get 10 million views
[1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:22.000]  5 million views 20 million views help Paul Watson at one like 80 million views
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:32.160]  for the lady and that told me wait a minute their social engineering not to
[1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:35.360]  police are perfect but they want to look at their shortcomings their problems
[1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:39.480]  so they can pressure them and take them over and now that's all admitted with a
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:45.080]  strong city initiative to have the UN take with the police so when I cover the
[1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:48.320]  shortcomings of the police and the problems it's not to undermine the
[1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:56.120]  police but it's not to just be some brazen cheerleader who's up there going
[1:40:56.120 --> 1:41:00.080]  well the left's attacking you so I'm gonna leave you alone no Biden has
[1:41:00.080 --> 1:41:05.840]  endorsed the police response in you've all because there's a cover-up and
[1:41:05.840 --> 1:41:12.080]  there's a stand down and we have all the videos now the crew did like six people
[1:41:12.080 --> 1:41:14.920]  in that control room they're not just running the cameras they're not just
[1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:18.840]  putting up gas they're not just finding articles they are when I say 30 minutes
[1:41:18.840 --> 1:41:23.120]  ago I want you to get in that live press conference you know how hard that is to
[1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:28.280]  like find it and get it and get the clips they had it in 20 minutes this has
[1:41:28.280 --> 1:41:32.560]  been on my desk for 10 minutes they bust it just amazing because I don't have
[1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:41.360]  internet works they have the clips of what really happened on Monday and the
[1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:48.720]  admissions as the system knows it's coming out and it is incredibly evil but
[1:41:48.720 --> 1:42:00.080]  the good news is they admit they're wrong and that's Texas because in some
[1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:06.520]  leftist place they never wrong already but with us we're not perfect but we
[1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:11.400]  admit we're wrong because we're men and that's what's really important so we're
[1:42:11.400 --> 1:42:15.400]  gonna come back in just a few minutes after this break and the state police and
[1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:20.920]  others now know the BS didn't work and I'm not saying there was a cover up because
[1:42:20.920 --> 1:42:25.200]  it's not enough time didn't go on they didn't really cover things up but they
[1:42:25.200 --> 1:42:29.080]  they went with a certain spin and now Biden's spitting it that they did a
[1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:32.120]  perfect job and no they didn't and to save children of the future and other
[1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:35.960]  innocence that these demons try to kill we've got to be honest about what
[1:42:35.960 --> 1:42:41.360]  happened here so we've got the clips when we come back they admit they order to
[1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:44.740]  stand down I don't know why the state police and local police listen to that
[1:42:44.740 --> 1:42:52.000]  damn police chief of the schools because if anybody's a villain if anybody's to
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:59.800]  blame is that decision that was made I want to thank all of you over the years

[1:45:19.560 --> 1:45:23.560]  the research funding pause it's not a stop it's not a prohibition it's when
[1:45:23.560 --> 1:45:26.800]  you come to a four-way intersection there's the stop sign you stop you look
[1:45:26.800 --> 1:45:30.840]  both ways and then you proceed and so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of
[1:45:30.840 --> 1:45:34.680]  function just selected gain-of-function but they'll argue that this is actually
[1:45:34.680 --> 1:45:39.200]  characterization and qualification research so you know Rand and others
[1:45:39.200 --> 1:45:41.840]  you know maybe Fauci was right they don't quite know what they're talking
[1:45:41.840 --> 1:45:44.520]  about calling it gain-of-function you know that's why he didn't perjure
[1:45:44.520 --> 1:45:47.720]  himself that's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating
[1:45:47.720 --> 1:45:51.400]  new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do but in the main
[1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:55.080]  definition it's still a gain-of-function they're making something deadly that
[1:45:55.080 --> 1:45:58.400]  spreads more easily to hurt people thank you Mike we love you I designed over

[1:48:29.080 --> 1:48:33.160]  they're up on info wars.com shooter entered school through propped open door
[1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:40.800]  had over 1,600 rounds that's a lot of ammo to carry. Texas police lieutenant
[1:48:40.800 --> 1:48:44.080]  says cops were reluctant to engage gun them because they could have been shot
[1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:50.700]  it's like I can't rock climb I might fall I can't have a child they might die
[1:48:50.700 --> 1:48:57.700]  we'll just give up and roll over then. So I got six of these clips Texas
[1:48:57.700 --> 1:49:01.900]  official this is the big news the decision not to breach the classroom was
[1:49:01.900 --> 1:49:06.140]  made by the chief of police for the school district so you've got training
[1:49:06.140 --> 1:49:10.260]  where you listen and wait for the chief of police sitting at some restaurant or
[1:49:10.260 --> 1:49:16.540]  at his house or wherever with his thumb in his rear end this is evil ladies and
[1:49:16.540 --> 1:49:19.980]  gentlemen this is the problem the decision not to breach the classroom was
[1:49:19.980 --> 1:49:24.740]  made by the chief of police for the school district he was contacted the
[1:49:24.740 --> 1:49:30.620]  time that there was no more threat to the children and that they had time to
[1:49:30.620 --> 1:49:36.420]  organize. Texas DPS say a girl inside one of the Evaldi elementary school
[1:49:36.420 --> 1:49:42.600]  students centers where the gun opened fire called 911 but no help came. Texas
[1:49:42.600 --> 1:49:48.300]  DPS official Texas embraces and teaches the active shooter doctrine as long as
[1:49:48.300 --> 1:49:52.540]  there is kids as long as there is someone that's firing you go to the gun you
[1:49:52.540 --> 1:49:57.540]  find them you neutralize them period but you didn't play clip A, B, and C back to
[1:49:57.540 --> 1:50:04.300]  back. The chief of police of Consolidated Infinite School District he was
[1:50:04.300 --> 1:50:08.620]  convinced and again I want to go back and say you know he was convinced at the
[1:50:08.620 --> 1:50:12.700]  time that there was no more threat to the children and that the subject was
[1:50:12.700 --> 1:50:17.140]  barricaded and that they had time to organize with the proper equipment to go
[1:50:17.140 --> 1:50:22.340]  in the subject already had to hit you know three officers and hit two officers
[1:50:22.340 --> 1:50:25.800]  and there's like didn't answer the final question a third a patrol agent was
[1:50:25.800 --> 1:50:30.060]  grazed as well but no one was no police officer was seriously injured and now
[1:50:30.060 --> 1:50:34.780]  I'd like to go over the 9-1-1 time line
[1:50:38.220 --> 1:50:42.380]  so warn you it's not not
[1:50:44.660 --> 1:50:48.900]  it's better there read it than you listen to it
[1:50:52.340 --> 1:50:59.660]  they called her identified I'll not say her name but she was in room 112 called
[1:50:59.660 --> 1:51:05.060]  9-1-1 and 12-03 the duration of the call was women in 23 seconds she identified
[1:51:05.060 --> 1:51:09.660]  herself whispered she's in room 112
[1:51:12.340 --> 1:51:22.660]  at 12-10 she called back in room 12 advisor multiple dead 12-13 again she
[1:51:22.660 --> 1:51:27.020]  called on the phone again at 12-16 she's called back and said there was eight to
[1:51:27.020 --> 1:51:35.740]  nine students alive at 12-19 the 9-1-1 call was made and and another person in
[1:51:35.740 --> 1:51:41.380]  room 111 called I will not say her name she hung up with another student told
[1:51:41.380 --> 1:51:48.500]  her to hang up 12-21 you could hear over the 9-1-1 call that three shots were
[1:51:48.500 --> 1:52:02.580]  fired at 12-36 9-1-1 call it lasted for 21 seconds the initial caller called back
[1:52:02.580 --> 1:52:08.220]  student child called back was told to stand the line and be very quiet she
[1:52:08.220 --> 1:52:14.460]  told I'm the one that he shot the door at approximately 12-43 and 12-47 she
[1:52:14.460 --> 1:52:18.620]  asked 9-1-1 to please send the police now
[1:52:22.660 --> 1:52:29.860]  at 12-46 she said she could not see that she could hear the police next door at
[1:52:29.860 --> 1:52:34.980]  12-50 shots are fired they could be heard with a 9-1 call and 12-51 is very
[1:52:34.980 --> 1:52:39.700]  loud and sounds like the officers are moving children out of the room at that
[1:52:39.700 --> 1:52:47.940]  time first of all the call was outside before the call cuts off first of all
[1:52:47.940 --> 1:52:52.540]  a Texas embraces and teaches okay the active shooter doctrine the active
[1:52:52.540 --> 1:52:56.900]  shooter shot doctrine as long as there's kids and long as there's someone's
[1:52:56.900 --> 1:53:01.780]  firing you go to the gun you find them you neutralize them period and there's
[1:53:01.780 --> 1:53:05.500]  only you know there are some nuances with going transition to a barricaded
[1:53:05.500 --> 1:53:11.380]  subject and also transitioning to a hostage situation and of course that
[1:53:11.380 --> 1:53:16.220]  the decision at the scene was that this is still a barricaded subject that did
[1:53:16.220 --> 1:53:21.620]  not go back to an active shooter so as bad as this is the state police are
[1:53:21.620 --> 1:53:25.700]  completely upset they feel guilty unlike Biden just loving it using to get the
[1:53:25.700 --> 1:53:30.900]  guns they mean they know this is a fiasco but here's the most important
[1:53:30.900 --> 1:53:36.260]  club officials say a decision was made that this was a barricaded subject there
[1:53:36.260 --> 1:53:41.820]  was time to relay and retrieve the keys from the benefit of hindsight it was the
[1:53:41.820 --> 1:53:49.140]  wrong decision here's that club 40 minute gap and if the 9-1-1 question
[1:53:49.140 --> 1:53:55.140]  simply this 40 minute gap if the 9-1-1 operators were aware that their
[1:53:55.140 --> 1:53:59.340]  children were alive in that classroom why were officers notified of that and
[1:53:59.340 --> 1:54:03.900]  if that's the case why didn't they take action that's the question give me I'll
[1:54:03.900 --> 1:54:08.900]  go back to the answer for right now is that that it was considered okay the
[1:54:08.900 --> 1:54:14.540]  decision was made on the scene I wasn't there at the same point in time you know
[1:54:14.540 --> 1:54:18.620]  a decision was made that this is a barricaded subject situation there was
[1:54:18.620 --> 1:54:24.820]  time to retrieve the keys and wait for a tactical came with the equipment to go
[1:54:24.820 --> 1:54:28.620]  ahead and reach the dorm and take on the subject at that point that was the
[1:54:28.620 --> 1:54:32.780]  decision that was the thought process that the picker point in time
[1:54:46.220 --> 1:54:50.380]  there was 19 like I said there's 19 officers in there in fact there was
[1:54:50.380 --> 1:54:54.540]  plenty of officers to do whatever needed to be done with one exception is that
[1:54:54.540 --> 1:54:59.500]  the the incident commander inside believe they needed more equipment and more
[1:54:59.500 --> 1:55:03.460]  officers to do a tactical breach at that point that's why four tack was requested
[1:55:03.460 --> 1:55:07.980]  on the scene as soon as they were there they executed a search at least a
[1:55:07.980 --> 1:55:31.220]  dynamic entry and went in and of course
[1:55:31.220 --> 1:55:41.180]  there's no excuse for that but again I wasn't there but I'm just telling you
[1:55:41.180 --> 1:55:45.620]  from what we know we believe this should have been an entry in that as soon as
[1:55:45.620 --> 1:55:49.900]  you can hey when there's an active shooter the rules cage it's no longer
[1:55:49.900 --> 1:55:54.140]  okay it's no longer a barricaded subject you don't have time you don't worry
[1:55:54.140 --> 1:55:59.340]  about matter of primaries and by the way Texas embraces active shooter training
[1:55:59.340 --> 1:56:05.020]  active shooter certification and that that dog that doctrine requires office
[1:56:05.020 --> 1:56:08.020]  we don't care what agency you're from you don't have to have a leader on the
[1:56:08.020 --> 1:56:13.020]  scene every officer lines up stacks up goes and finds what those rounds are
[1:56:13.020 --> 1:56:20.340]  being fired at and he keeps shooting until the subject is dead period well as
[1:56:20.340 --> 1:56:23.940]  bad as all this is I'm proud of Texas today you would never see a leftist admit
[1:56:23.940 --> 1:56:28.620]  they're wrong you would never see a globalist admit fault you just saw Steve
[1:56:28.620 --> 1:56:32.300]  McCraw the head of the DPS say yeah this should have gone better we made a
[1:56:32.300 --> 1:56:36.700]  mistake we're not perfect this happened we thought it was a hostile situation
[1:56:36.700 --> 1:56:41.940]  they should have just gone and he killed everybody inside the admission of being
[1:56:41.940 --> 1:56:47.100]  wrong is so key to make it better and it doesn't absolve what happened nobody
[1:56:47.100 --> 1:56:50.300]  wants kids getting killed we're all pissed off but you just saw the head of the
[1:56:50.300 --> 1:56:55.020]  DPS in Texas admit this should have been better better we messed up this is
[1:56:55.020 --> 1:57:01.260]  wrong you will never see that from Joe Biden or Barack Obama or George
[1:57:01.260 --> 1:57:04.860]  Soros because they don't give a damn those state police up there you can see
[1:57:04.860 --> 1:57:10.100]  them are racked with guilt because they're not demons and the demons must
[1:57:10.100 --> 1:57:14.340]  have a great life because they don't give a damn about anybody and they ain't
[1:57:14.340 --> 1:57:19.340]  got to worry about nothing and the real issue is he was known he was planning it
[1:57:19.340 --> 1:57:23.500]  and there was a system that let him do it that's not the state police doesn't
[1:57:23.500 --> 1:57:25.980]  defend the place and my job doesn't defend the place when they're wrong I'll
[1:57:25.980 --> 1:57:29.900]  attack them in a minute but you get in a situation like that you've got to be
[1:57:29.900 --> 1:57:35.700]  there to know what happened and they just admitted it was wrong it was bad you
[1:57:35.700 --> 1:57:39.340]  don't only see that in other leftist areas you see that in places like Texas
[1:57:39.340 --> 1:57:43.740]  Texas ain't perfect you just saw some real truth hour number three straight

[2:02:17.700 --> 2:02:24.940]  for an outright ban picking up every one of them Mr. and Mrs. America turn them
[2:02:24.940 --> 2:02:29.300]  all in I would have done it when they give us that inch that bump stock ban
[2:02:29.300 --> 2:02:34.540]  we will take a mile you've heard people say you'll have to pry my gun for my
[2:02:34.540 --> 2:02:44.220]  cold day okay we have introduced an assault weapons ban I'm talking about a
[2:02:44.220 --> 2:02:49.980]  ban on assault rifles if you listen real close you can hear the people in
[2:02:49.980 --> 2:02:54.620]  power shaking it's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then
[2:02:54.620 --> 2:02:58.420]  only do it every Monday we need to do this every day of the week and just
[2:02:58.420 --> 2:03:02.540]  really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way
[2:03:02.540 --> 2:03:09.140]  enough enough enough we say no more I'm the guy that originally wrote the
[2:03:09.140 --> 2:03:13.700]  assault weapons ban that that became law and gentlemen just walked up to me in
[2:03:13.700 --> 2:03:17.860]  his picture line he says hi have an AR-15 and I will turn this in if it means
[2:03:17.860 --> 2:03:23.020]  saving the lives of our kids hell yes we're gonna take your AR-15 your AK-47
[2:03:23.020 --> 2:03:32.260]  do you think Trump is responsible for what happened I said well look I mean
[2:03:32.260 --> 2:03:36.180]  obviously he didn't pull the trigger but he's certainly been tweeting out the
[2:03:36.180 --> 2:03:46.540]  ammunition I'm incredibly saddened it's very hard to think about this I'm tired
[2:03:46.540 --> 2:03:50.980]  of hearing people all they have to offer is thoughts and prayers in my faith
[2:03:50.980 --> 2:03:56.180]  people say faith without works is dead so we will find a way but the reason we
[2:03:56.180 --> 2:03:59.980]  have a problem right now is we've let the the corporate gun lobby frame this
[2:03:59.980 --> 2:04:05.380]  debate it is time that we have bold actions in a bold agenda over 90% of
[2:04:05.380 --> 2:04:09.300]  the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street period
[2:04:09.300 --> 2:04:12.820]  and we have to get buybacks and get them out of their basements everyone up
[2:04:12.820 --> 2:04:18.780]  here favors an assault weapon ban everyone up here favors magazine
[2:04:18.780 --> 2:04:22.500]  limitations which by the way would have made a huge difference we can ban the
[2:04:22.500 --> 2:04:26.100]  weapons of war it's about ending the sales of assault weapons into our
[2:04:26.100 --> 2:04:29.820]  communities those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively
[2:04:29.820 --> 2:04:33.340]  and as efficiently as possible they should belong on the battlefield and not
[2:04:33.340 --> 2:04:36.580]  in our communities but I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree
[2:04:36.580 --> 2:04:42.060]  that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not in the hands of criminals
[2:04:42.060 --> 2:04:46.900]  by the way you can't own the following weapons period they cannot be sold
[2:04:46.900 --> 2:04:50.300]  anymore like if you're going to take people's guns away wait till you get
[2:04:50.300 --> 2:04:53.900]  elected then take the guns
[2:04:58.380 --> 2:05:02.900]  introducing come and take it our third and final coin a part of the founding

[2:05:11.780 --> 2:05:15.700]  meaning for Americans from recent history but it actually dates back to
[2:05:15.700 --> 2:05:21.100]  being used in 480 BC in the Battle of Thermopylae as Molon Lope by Spartan
[2:05:21.100 --> 2:05:25.820]  King Leonidas it has since become a symbol of defiance here in America
[2:05:25.820 --> 2:05:30.340]  along with the imagery of a black star and cannon in the flag used by Texans
[2:05:30.340 --> 2:05:34.660]  during the state's revolution against Mexico both sides of the coin to pick
[2:05:34.660 --> 2:05:39.100]  these historical uses of the phrase with one side having a rendition of a

[2:05:47.900 --> 2:05:53.900]  1776 coin dot com today to secure your founding member coin hurry before they're
[2:05:53.900 --> 2:05:59.260]  gone as there will only be 10,000 in existence
[2:05:59.260 --> 2:06:15.340]  you are listening to an infowars dot com front-line report if you are receiving
[2:06:15.340 --> 2:06:20.180]  this transmission you are the resistance
[2:06:20.180 --> 2:06:24.860]  all right one of the hardest guests to get on and out of all the prominent
[2:06:24.860 --> 2:06:29.820]  scientists individuals exposing the whole COVID police state takeover and the
[2:06:29.820 --> 2:06:34.900]  new lockdown she's the tip of the spear Dr. Judy Mikovits worked with Fauci blew
[2:06:34.900 --> 2:06:38.620]  the whistle on him they came after her there's been blockbuster films made about
[2:06:38.620 --> 2:06:44.820]  it I cover her old bio but she's traveling the country right now exposing
[2:06:44.820 --> 2:06:51.540]  what's happening the real dr. Judy dot com and so much is happening instead of
[2:06:51.540 --> 2:06:57.500]  me asking questions sees the expert blew us away last year when she was here so
[2:06:57.500 --> 2:07:03.580]  thank you doctor for joining us with all this other big news it's obscuring the
[2:07:03.580 --> 2:07:07.540]  next lockdowns the next force inoculations monkeypox everything thank
[2:07:07.540 --> 2:07:12.660]  you so much for joining us you've got the floor please take over but well thank
[2:07:12.660 --> 2:07:17.900]  you Alex I appreciated I guess I was disturbed watching those commercials on
[2:07:17.900 --> 2:07:24.740]  the info thinking about the bio weapons and the shots that you know we all know
[2:07:24.740 --> 2:07:33.260]  untested unsafe have been injected into our you know literally poison and so we
[2:07:33.260 --> 2:07:41.980]  been shooting our children the COVID bio weapon that was weaponized to to cause
[2:07:41.980 --> 2:07:48.900]  you know permanent injury or death in the most susceptible in our society who
[2:07:48.900 --> 2:07:55.900]  have been participate who have been unwilling or unwitting participants in
[2:07:55.900 --> 2:08:03.340]  40 years of their experimentation by Tony Fauci and come on a week ago I
[2:08:03.340 --> 2:08:07.540]  wanted to put a piece together all your predictions they came true I mean we are
[2:08:07.540 --> 2:08:13.140]  living through this now yeah it's an it's unfortunate because you know we've
[2:08:13.140 --> 2:08:21.700]  we've been you know we've been exposing this every every single talk I give have
[2:08:21.700 --> 2:08:26.740]  always has always been based on published data I show you the facts and how the
[2:08:26.740 --> 2:08:32.420]  words are twisted and and how the words are used differently to lie to the
[2:08:32.420 --> 2:08:39.460]  public I mean and this is my testimony there's my name is s not z so I'll let
[2:08:39.460 --> 2:08:50.100]  you go with that and so it's it's it's really it's disturbing that this bio
[2:08:50.100 --> 2:08:56.500]  weapon has killed 61,000 Millennials and that was Edward
[2:08:56.500 --> 2:09:02.340]  I apologize we're gonna fix your name even we know who you are well dr. Judy tell us
[2:09:02.340 --> 2:09:06.980]  what as an expert as people that don't know I couldn't do your bio properly tell
[2:09:06.980 --> 2:09:10.860]  us who you are what you went through how you knew Fauci what you did spend some
[2:09:10.860 --> 2:09:16.540]  time on yourself and then get into what you really they're doing well I'm you
[2:09:16.540 --> 2:09:23.020]  know I'm a I have a PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology which I defended
[2:09:23.020 --> 2:09:29.980]  on November my thesis I defended my thesis which was HIV late HIV latency
[2:09:29.980 --> 2:09:35.740]  that is silencing in in monocytes in a type of cell in the innate immune
[2:09:35.740 --> 2:09:44.220]  system and basically if your if your cell biology if your if your innate
[2:09:44.220 --> 2:09:50.380]  immunity is kept strong what this basic what the thesis said was HIV will never
[2:09:50.380 --> 2:09:57.420]  cause AIDS so I I defended that thesis one week after Magic Johnson declared
[2:09:57.420 --> 2:10:03.300]  that he tested seropositive that means he had an antibody we didn't you know have
[2:10:03.300 --> 2:10:08.340]  PCR today we had PCR but you know Kerry Mullis was still alive and knew you
[2:10:08.340 --> 2:10:14.980]  don't test for infectious viruses particularly retroviruses as we 8% of
[2:10:14.980 --> 2:10:21.220]  our genome is retroviral and this was the basis of all my work was this PhD
[2:10:21.220 --> 2:10:27.060]  thesis saying HIV doesn't have to cause disease if you keep your innate immune
[2:10:27.060 --> 2:10:35.100]  system healthy and my work progressed through the 90s where I was literally
[2:10:35.100 --> 2:10:42.380]  developing clones of cell lines in order to support growth of other viruses
[2:10:42.380 --> 2:10:47.980]  like Ebola and and other strains of viruses to understand the molecular
[2:10:47.980 --> 2:10:55.300]  pathways of how they cause disease with the idea that you would attenuate those
[2:10:55.300 --> 2:11:02.100]  pathways and make them weaker but what actually Tony Fauci and the pharma
[2:11:02.100 --> 2:11:11.660]  copia the the criminal farm are the pharmacy that owns our country the FDA the
[2:11:11.660 --> 2:11:16.820]  CDC what they were actually doing was experimenting on the most vulnerable in
[2:11:16.820 --> 2:11:26.300]  our society using these cell lines that were used to I cultured Ebola Zaire strain
[2:11:26.300 --> 2:11:32.660]  I I looked at Ebola Zaire strain versus Ebola rest in strain and showed in the
[2:11:32.660 --> 2:11:38.100]  mid 90s actually published and put a publication together in in all of this
[2:11:38.100 --> 2:11:44.300]  all the way back and all of these and and and hear the Ebola rest in strain
[2:11:44.300 --> 2:11:51.780]  from the bats is grown efficiently in the Vero E6 clone it's a sub clone you
[2:11:51.780 --> 2:11:58.300]  clone by limiting delusion how to how to how to make these cells these viruses
[2:11:58.300 --> 2:12:04.900]  not kill the cells so that you can grow them in theoretically develop by
[2:12:04.900 --> 2:12:10.260]  understanding the mechanisms natural product therapies or treatments and what
[2:12:10.260 --> 2:12:17.180]  that work showed throughout the three decades was in fact what Tony Fauci was
[2:12:17.180 --> 2:12:22.820]  doing was weaponizing these was was every cell line has been in our lab and
[2:12:22.820 --> 2:12:30.380]  so we I published you know I was I was arrested in 2011 when the discovery that
[2:12:30.380 --> 2:12:38.260]  I published in the journal science in 2009 was shown to be a family of mouse
[2:12:38.260 --> 2:12:46.100]  related viruses known as XMRVs so murine leukemia virus related retrovirus they
[2:12:46.100 --> 2:12:53.260]  literally cause cancer and they literally were spread through the labs through no
[2:12:53.260 --> 2:12:59.180]  socomil through the lab workers these were viruses and mouse viruses monkey
[2:12:59.180 --> 2:13:05.500]  viruses that were being used in these cell lines to recombine and and this is
[2:13:05.500 --> 2:13:12.740]  all the work of Barrick and everything so I was arrested in 2011 for refusing to
[2:13:12.740 --> 2:13:20.900]  lie about the data publish it a different way interpreted a different way and you
[2:13:20.900 --> 2:13:25.700]  know basically just defraud the public and keep the game going I was arrested
[2:13:25.700 --> 2:13:28.180]  without a warrant this is all the topic of the movie
[2:13:28.180 --> 2:13:33.900]  pandemic you can find it at plan them x series calm and that was that original
[2:13:33.900 --> 2:13:41.900]  movie which came out May 4th of 2020 was supposed to be a promotional video of
[2:13:41.900 --> 2:13:47.460]  this book which is plague of corruption so this book which is plague of
[2:13:47.460 --> 2:13:52.260]  corruption and in the slides that I sent you that were we are touring the
[2:13:52.260 --> 2:13:58.540]  country over the last month or so and for the next few weeks bit literally
[2:13:58.540 --> 2:14:05.900]  showing you you know the proof so of this book plague of corruption I started
[2:14:05.900 --> 2:14:12.340]  writing with Kent heck and lively in 2014 when I realized our first book which
[2:14:12.340 --> 2:14:18.660]  described every story about the XMRVs the retroviruses how in Lipkin John
[2:14:18.660 --> 2:14:24.780]  coffin the medical mafia Bob Bob Silverman Joe DeRisi I'm literally given
[2:14:24.780 --> 2:14:31.540]  awards Bob Silverman was was was particularly crippling the virus the
[2:14:31.540 --> 2:14:38.660]  the the part of our immune system called RNA cell that is a an enzyme that
[2:14:38.660 --> 2:14:45.940]  degrades RNA DNA hybrids so messenger RNA that will be reverse transcribed back
[2:14:45.940 --> 2:14:53.380]  into DNA which is what a retroviruses it writes backwards mRNA into DNA and then
[2:14:53.380 --> 2:15:00.700]  inserts it into the DNA of your genome causing cancers yes so this is the cover
[2:15:00.700 --> 2:15:05.180]  slide of that talk and what what Patrick Wood talks about is
[2:15:05.180 --> 2:15:12.940]  technocracy and and basically the whole idea that in these books what we show
[2:15:12.940 --> 2:15:19.580]  is natural selection the other title as you showed in the first slide yeah yes
[2:15:19.580 --> 2:15:26.260]  exactly so here's what came out right after fake science well fact-checking I'm
[2:15:26.260 --> 2:15:32.300]  not a virologist I'm a biochemist and a molecular biologist I have a PhD which
[2:15:32.300 --> 2:15:39.140]  I means I teach I educate I discover and I solve problems so I had to change the
[2:15:39.140 --> 2:15:45.060]  way medicine was practiced and I'm not a chronic fatigue syndrome researcher
[2:15:45.060 --> 2:15:50.340]  I'm gonna come back and get into what's currently happening what's
[2:15:50.340 --> 2:15:53.980]  unfolding and how we stop the next phase of the takeover status will be right
[2:15:53.980 --> 2:16:01.900]  back we are now proud to release the redux line of Faraday bags this line
[2:16:01.900 --> 2:16:06.580]  features quick roll down and velcro seal closures with discrete branding with

[2:16:24.980 --> 2:16:30.140]  unsecured locations to instantly block all wireless signals and protect them
[2:16:30.140 --> 2:16:36.180]  from remote wiping tracking and tampering redux is dedicated to producing
[2:16:36.180 --> 2:16:41.300]  and selling cost-effective signature reduction products for professionals
[2:16:41.300 --> 2:16:47.620]  needing to secure devices from wireless threats and more so check out redux to
[2:16:47.620 --> 2:16:56.420]  instantly block cellular Wi-Fi Bluetooth RFID camera EMP weather and even GPS
[2:16:56.420 --> 2:17:02.820]  today the globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID
[2:17:02.820 --> 2:17:09.660]  biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled they would then use
[2:17:09.660 --> 2:17:13.860]  that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[2:17:13.860 --> 2:17:19.140]  anybody that speaks out against their lives but because of so many scientists
[2:17:19.140 --> 2:17:24.420]  and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers now
[2:17:24.420 --> 2:17:29.140]  their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it
[2:17:29.140 --> 2:17:34.500]  is a world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain
[2:17:34.500 --> 2:17:38.540]  now more than ever the problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going
[2:17:38.540 --> 2:17:43.540]  to give up on their takeover like Canada they've now declared a civil
[2:17:43.540 --> 2:17:47.740]  emergency and martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world are
[2:17:47.740 --> 2:17:52.380]  following suit like Australia so pray for these folks big-time it's a very serious
[2:17:52.380 --> 2:17:56.460]  situation and stay tuned into info wars comm because truth is absolutely

[2:19:42.660 --> 2:19:46.980]  a 360 win the only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this
[2:19:46.980 --> 2:19:50.660]  product to boost your body's natural defenses and keep info wars on the air
[2:19:50.660 --> 2:19:57.340]  the globalists are hoping you don't take action take action now infowarstore.com
[2:19:57.340 --> 2:20:08.340]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:20:16.340 --> 2:20:22.380]  all right judy michael vitz is a author filmmaker but as you heard her
[2:20:22.380 --> 2:20:27.660]  scientist and she's right the center of Fauci and predicting over two years ago
[2:20:27.660 --> 2:20:31.500]  it would unfold now it's here the mass debt the heart attacks the illnesses
[2:20:31.500 --> 2:20:35.340]  the exploding cancer so you did a great job last segment laying out a lot of
[2:20:35.340 --> 2:20:37.980]  facts but I'm trying to give you the floor this segment so I'm not gonna
[2:20:37.980 --> 2:20:41.580]  interrupt you it's a nine-minute segment you take over the show right now and
[2:20:41.580 --> 2:20:45.340]  just talk to us like we're not microbiologists talk to us like we're
[2:20:45.340 --> 2:20:50.260]  not scientists and explain to us what's really happening right that is the
[2:20:50.260 --> 2:20:56.420]  difficult part so I I show you a the slide 39 of that slide deck so when we
[2:20:56.420 --> 2:21:01.740]  do these at the Crimes Against Humanities tour I show you every detail so
[2:21:01.740 --> 2:21:07.060]  basically what happened for 40 years is Tony Fauci and the pharmaceutical
[2:21:07.060 --> 2:21:13.980]  industry were experimenting by way of untested manufactured synthetic
[2:21:13.980 --> 2:21:20.220]  recombinant vaccines everything we know about what was in plague of corruption
[2:21:20.220 --> 2:21:28.100]  and then the the pandemic event 201 which was held in late 2019 when the book
[2:21:28.100 --> 2:21:34.700]  was supposed to be published now here we have we had solutions for the autism
[2:21:34.700 --> 2:21:42.500]  myalgic encephalomyelitis psychosis PTSD all the cancers caused by the
[2:21:42.500 --> 2:21:50.620]  murine leukemia the XMRVs and that can be monkey mouse manufactured because as
[2:21:50.620 --> 2:21:58.420]  we see in this slide and then sermon so what is sermon so sermon is a hundred
[2:21:58.420 --> 2:22:06.260]  year old drug that is in the same family of drugs as ivermectin yes and so I
[2:22:06.260 --> 2:22:14.980]  show the slide and that review was published at the end of 2020 but what
[2:22:14.980 --> 2:22:21.620]  nobody knows about is that drug was used by us I'm a drug developer a natural
[2:22:21.620 --> 2:22:29.460]  products developer at the National Cancer Institute from 1980 until 2001 when
[2:22:29.460 --> 2:22:34.460]  I moved to industry at epigenics pharmaceuticals so what our research showed
[2:22:34.460 --> 2:22:38.980]  over 20 years was it was the expression of the genes not the presence of the
[2:22:38.980 --> 2:22:44.220]  genes and particularly in the retrovirus keep it silent don't let it wake up and
[2:22:44.220 --> 2:22:49.780]  it won't recombine and it won't be infectious but you cannot inject any of
[2:22:49.780 --> 2:22:56.340]  the manjuvaxured viruses so every single vaccine on the schedule is a new
[2:22:56.340 --> 2:23:01.820]  biological a new therapy they've never been tested they're manufactured they're
[2:23:01.820 --> 2:23:08.020]  recombinant and here in that key to everything is the envelope the spike
[2:23:08.020 --> 2:23:16.660]  protein that nobody's talking about in SARS-CoV-2 was a monkey virus SARS
[2:23:16.660 --> 2:23:22.820]  CoV-2 is a monkey virus made in in in yeah here it is right here in this slide
[2:23:22.820 --> 2:23:28.420]  so here they've been experimenting for 40 years and they publish a hundred years
[2:23:28.420 --> 2:23:34.540]  of medicinal chemistry it's a synthetic drug well I talked about it on purpose
[2:23:34.540 --> 2:23:39.620]  last year because I knew of the double-blind placebo controlled study so
[2:23:39.620 --> 2:23:45.820]  this the target of this pure-energic modulator purines and pyrimidines make
[2:23:45.820 --> 2:23:51.580]  up the base pairs of your DNA the purines are A and G ivermectin and
[2:23:51.580 --> 2:23:57.140]  seramin are pure-energic modulators they're absolutely vital hundred year
[2:23:57.140 --> 2:24:01.980]  old and sit 40 year old essential medicines as we know and here you see in
[2:24:01.980 --> 2:24:07.180]  this review here are all the diseases and pathogens susceptible to seramin so
[2:24:07.180 --> 2:24:13.260]  you've got it hepatitis HIV AIDS enterovirus 71 is the new polio if you
[2:24:13.260 --> 2:24:20.940]  will that that the polio vaccine is causing so ebola zika dengue all look
[2:24:20.940 --> 2:24:26.900]  at all the cancers look at down the below snake bite arthritis so here you
[2:24:26.900 --> 2:24:34.140]  have COVID oh here you have COVID all the people who they've denied ivermectin
[2:24:34.140 --> 2:24:39.500]  and seramin fabulous anti-cancer they knew they were causing these diseases
[2:24:39.500 --> 2:24:47.020]  and I go to slide 41 on that slideshow 41 slides into it and I'm showing you
[2:24:47.020 --> 2:24:55.100]  data which prove absolutely everything I'm saying here is a 2011 paper October
[2:24:55.100 --> 2:25:00.580]  2011 it was submitted to the Journal of Irology and it was published in January
[2:25:00.580 --> 2:25:07.620]  2012 why is that significant because I was locked out of my lab fired all my
[2:25:07.620 --> 2:25:14.620]  data taken away from me engineered by Tony Fauci who paid off the my employers
[2:25:14.620 --> 2:25:19.980]  the widow moors who actually convicted felons for having Harry read a league
[2:25:19.980 --> 2:25:24.380]  illegally elected all of these stories are in our books they're not stories
[2:25:24.380 --> 2:25:28.380]  they're fact nobody's ever challenged one word of our book which is why
[2:25:28.380 --> 2:25:35.260]  pandemic says a hundred percent censored so every time so that paper from 2011
[2:25:35.260 --> 2:25:41.420]  that I just showed you look at all of those sequences in paper 41 it was
[2:25:41.420 --> 2:25:46.620]  submitted a month after I was fired and all the data out of my lab and all the
[2:25:46.620 --> 2:25:51.420]  samples all the cell lines all the evidence they thought they had locked
[2:25:51.420 --> 2:25:55.660]  down but the last chapter of our books said we weren't criminal William
[2:25:55.660 --> 2:26:01.940]  Thompson we saved all the samples and look at 41 this is chaizheng Lee look
[2:26:01.940 --> 2:26:08.020]  at all the viruses look at all the strains look at all the retroviruses in
[2:26:08.020 --> 2:26:13.820]  the bottom left panel the retroviruses you see there on the very bottom Maloney
[2:26:13.820 --> 2:26:19.660]  Murin leukemia virus there's also one called mason Pfizer monkey virus oh
[2:26:19.660 --> 2:26:24.460]  that would be that pox virus so if you look at all of these and this is what
[2:26:24.460 --> 2:26:30.540]  they published in journal virology thinking nobody could say in bat feces
[2:26:30.540 --> 2:26:36.700]  in a cave in China as if they came there but so then the very bottom of
[2:26:36.700 --> 2:26:42.300]  retroviruses how did a cap rine arthritis and cephalitis virus that's a
[2:26:42.300 --> 2:26:48.100]  goat or a sheep virus how did this get and a Maloney murine is another mouse
[2:26:48.100 --> 2:26:52.380]  virus and then it says other retroviruses so if you go to the next slide
[2:26:52.380 --> 2:26:56.500]  so daughter make of it my convince explain these people they are putting
[2:26:56.500 --> 2:27:01.500]  zoological viruses in the vaccines and they're they're in the cell lines and
[2:27:01.500 --> 2:27:05.740]  they've been there all along if you look at the next slide what you're gonna see
[2:27:05.740 --> 2:27:10.980]  is the other retroviruses in the supplemental material that nobody ever
[2:27:10.980 --> 2:27:17.220]  reads in the papers so you don't know so they're showing you how did you get VP
[2:27:17.220 --> 2:27:23.540]  62 which is a lab infectious gain of function molecular clone made by Bob
[2:27:23.540 --> 2:27:29.700]  Silverman's lab oh the one who made it evade the immune system of blacks
[2:27:29.700 --> 2:27:34.700]  Native Americans they know exactly what they're doing look at all of the
[2:27:34.700 --> 2:27:41.700]  viruses how did you say this is a race specific attack well it's it's race and
[2:27:41.700 --> 2:27:48.340]  gender and that's why the first slide said favored species what Darwin is
[2:27:48.340 --> 2:27:55.140]  doing this is they are our God this is this is Pat Patrick Woods testimony in
[2:27:55.140 --> 2:28:00.180]  our and presentations in the crimes against humanity that they're God so
[2:28:00.180 --> 2:28:06.780]  they know exactly as they've targeted the athletes like Magic Johnson HIV is to
[2:28:06.780 --> 2:28:12.540]  AZT is to a day here it is the original paper origins of species by natural
[2:28:12.540 --> 2:28:17.620]  selection is what most people see and nobody sees that second page or the
[2:28:17.620 --> 2:28:23.140]  preservation of favored races in the struggle of life so they think they can
[2:28:23.140 --> 2:28:29.500]  change the code of our DNA the one-world order and this is the game to inject us
[2:28:29.500 --> 2:28:37.740]  with that cell line every one of the viruses on 41 are in Vero E6 are in the
[2:28:37.740 --> 2:28:47.060]  Vero monkey kidney cell lines we've been injecting is polio vaccines for 30 years
[2:28:47.060 --> 2:28:52.700]  and and they've acknowledged this in every slide John or Judy Megavits Megavits
[2:28:52.700 --> 2:28:56.140]  stay right there we'll be right back to us

[2:32:53.220 --> 2:33:06.540]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[2:33:06.540 --> 2:33:23.260]  Clashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones
[2:33:36.540 --> 2:33:46.980]  All right I hope listeners are listening very very closely Judy
[2:33:46.980 --> 2:33:52.860]  Micovits who is a top scientist work directly with Fauci on record who
[2:33:52.860 --> 2:33:56.820]  exposed the plan to implant cancer viruses in us but it's not just her
[2:33:56.820 --> 2:34:00.660]  opinion that she didn't just witness it it's in the Rockefeller Foundation
[2:34:00.660 --> 2:34:05.900]  documents it's in the movie JFK they were trying to create cancer viruses and
[2:34:05.900 --> 2:34:13.660]  jackets because that was going on and even even Jim Garrison of the district
[2:34:13.660 --> 2:34:18.540]  attorney of New Orleans found all that so this is their big move what does the
[2:34:18.540 --> 2:34:22.700]  spike protein do what do we now expect to see she predicted two years ago the
[2:34:22.700 --> 2:34:27.780]  mass death record cancer all of it what's coming next how is their plan going
[2:34:27.780 --> 2:34:31.940]  and how do we counter it she's giving us all the high-level analysis if I can go
[2:34:31.940 --> 2:34:37.540]  look up but big picture just a citizen as a human of where this is doctor yeah
[2:34:37.540 --> 2:34:40.740]  the big picture of where this is because that's what I was showing in the
[2:34:40.740 --> 2:34:46.620]  slides they've been in these cell lines how did an infectious molecular clone
[2:34:46.620 --> 2:34:54.220]  which is a gain of function virus as every single vaccine manufactured today
[2:34:54.220 --> 2:34:59.860]  not a single safety studies done double blind placebo controlled study where
[2:34:59.860 --> 2:35:04.260]  they know that they're killing so what's happening right now all those
[2:35:04.260 --> 2:35:09.580]  viruses are in all those vaccines are in all those products you have the
[2:35:09.580 --> 2:35:15.100]  aborted fetal cell lines and you can see the dangers of using GMOs as your
[2:35:15.100 --> 2:35:20.340]  just as your last talk just showed my first degree that I got in 1980 is a
[2:35:20.340 --> 2:35:25.180]  natural products chemist I make drugs out of plants and this is what the
[2:35:25.180 --> 2:35:29.580]  government is stopping you from having minerals vitamins amino acids all
[2:35:29.580 --> 2:35:36.060]  people have to do right now is realize every single shot has had these
[2:35:36.060 --> 2:35:42.020]  sequences in them the infectious molecular clones the gain of function
[2:35:42.020 --> 2:35:48.820]  synthetic manufactured viruses in every specific it may be a tetanus shot it
[2:35:48.820 --> 2:35:51.780]  may be have a ton of shot it may actually do that but it's got all this is a
[2:35:51.780 --> 2:35:57.540]  payload as well correct there is no tetanus shot because it's a d-tab and
[2:35:57.540 --> 2:36:03.540]  all of these things are manufactured and we've shown this in vaccine court we
[2:36:03.540 --> 2:36:08.540]  showed the injured I have we showed the contaminants thought red blood cells
[2:36:08.540 --> 2:36:15.020]  these are the slide number 44 shows you a 2017 paper done by the Italians these
[2:36:15.020 --> 2:36:21.540]  are published studies showing you all the garbage in the shots so COVID-19 is
[2:36:21.540 --> 2:36:28.780]  kill or yeah look at that it's not just the COVID-19 bio weapon the shot that was
[2:36:28.780 --> 2:36:34.860]  weaponized because the monkey virus they created in 2004 I show you the
[2:36:34.860 --> 2:36:41.660]  publication of the tripartite part HIV part XMRB that envelope that is called
[2:36:41.660 --> 2:36:49.100]  syncytine that is the component of snake venom every animal every human has
[2:36:49.100 --> 2:36:54.740]  syncytine so if you put another human in the aborted fetal cell line a male and
[2:36:54.740 --> 2:37:00.700]  a female that are in every vaccine and we give every vaccine all at once six
[2:37:00.700 --> 2:37:04.660]  things I'll slow down explain an immortal cell line to people or they don't know
[2:37:04.660 --> 2:37:09.740]  what that means it means they live forever they grow in the lab I take a I
[2:37:09.740 --> 2:37:15.140]  take a liquid like this a vial this is what people don't understand and I grow
[2:37:15.140 --> 2:37:21.220]  it up in a in a fermenter and I do fermentation chemistry I had cow blood I
[2:37:21.220 --> 2:37:26.500]  had media I had horse blood I had pig blood I had bovine serum abumin I had
[2:37:26.500 --> 2:37:31.660]  anti-mycotics I and antibiotics and I grow it in a fermenter and then I
[2:37:31.660 --> 2:37:38.460]  isolate the whole thing meaning and and purify it filter away all the other
[2:37:38.460 --> 2:37:48.180]  animal did proteins and then make only the vaccine using the one virus but
[2:37:48.180 --> 2:37:53.300]  that's never been done that's what everybody thinks is in a vaccine no
[2:37:53.300 --> 2:38:01.940]  every virus I showed you on that 2011 paper along with synthetic viruses out
[2:38:01.940 --> 2:38:11.140]  of our laboratory have been in those cell lines since 1992 I made those clones
[2:38:11.140 --> 2:38:20.140]  I did that work they injected that Ebola in 2014 Tony Fauci sent it to
[2:38:20.140 --> 2:38:27.900]  Liberia under the direction of Obama in a vaccine program killed 21,000
[2:38:27.900 --> 2:38:34.420]  innocent people in Liberia and literally to cover up William Thompson's
[2:38:34.420 --> 2:38:41.060]  confession of the CDC fraud that was that was you know that he confessed so
[2:38:41.060 --> 2:38:45.220]  Dr. Michael this you are a leading expert you're so respected what is their end
[2:38:45.220 --> 2:38:48.740]  game why are they doing this how is it they're gonna go away with implanting
[2:38:48.740 --> 2:38:54.540]  everybody with cancer-causing programs the end game is to kill everybody they
[2:38:54.540 --> 2:39:00.620]  experimented on in that table Zika Ebola they figured out everything they needed
[2:39:00.620 --> 2:39:04.580]  to do to hurt the Brazilians to hurt the blacks to hurt the you know all the
[2:39:04.580 --> 2:39:10.860]  various endemic viruses how to cause disease along with weaponized black
[2:39:10.860 --> 2:39:16.060]  folks are smart worldwide not want to take a shot absolutely and we advise the
[2:39:16.060 --> 2:39:20.580]  honorable with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Dr. Noinswinder
[2:39:20.580 --> 2:39:26.220]  advised the honorable minister Lewis Farrakhan on December 18th 2020 said
[2:39:26.220 --> 2:39:30.780]  please don't give this to black people and he he saw every slide that was in
[2:39:30.780 --> 2:39:36.540]  this projector I haven't used a new slide until their new publications in 2020 as
[2:39:36.540 --> 2:39:41.500]  they try to con you these slides came from presentations of vaccine court and
[2:39:41.500 --> 2:39:46.580]  down all the way on slide I'm just gonna show you one picture that everybody
[2:39:46.580 --> 2:39:53.540]  appreciates what we have to do is never get another shot do not take their
[2:39:53.540 --> 2:40:00.500]  poison they do bear Monsanto look at picture number
[2:40:01.100 --> 2:40:10.900]  64 and ask yourself is that monkey pox this is a vaccine injury of a boy of
[2:40:10.900 --> 2:40:15.780]  Vietnamese because it's not just blacks it's Hispanics it's Native Americans
[2:40:15.780 --> 2:40:21.660]  they know exactly what disease they're trying to cause and now COVID was murder
[2:40:21.660 --> 2:40:26.700]  them all with the shot premeditated murder is what I'm charging them with
[2:40:26.700 --> 2:40:32.220]  and I prove it through these four books the litter I know that Dick Cheney in
[2:40:32.220 --> 2:40:36.460]  April 2000 wrote we building a marriage defenses for PNAC and call for a
[2:40:36.460 --> 2:40:40.540]  specific bio weapons but I know plenty of white people that have died after the
[2:40:40.540 --> 2:40:45.220]  shot and of COVID but I have talked a lot other scientists they do say this is
[2:40:45.220 --> 2:40:50.420]  very specific so what's really going on well I mean it's both because our immune
[2:40:50.420 --> 2:40:55.540]  systems I'm a lab worker it's also misogynist it's against women because
[2:40:55.540 --> 2:41:01.180]  what they can't do the globalist is hack our genome we are not our DNA we're our
[2:41:01.180 --> 2:41:05.740]  chromosomes and so if they keep injecting us as they bypassed our innate
[2:41:05.740 --> 2:41:09.860]  immune response that would that's what Gert Vandenbosch explained that we are
[2:41:09.860 --> 2:41:13.900]  already pre-programmed with the Constitution who we are they can only
[2:41:13.900 --> 2:41:18.540]  try to manipulate the feed to that they don't control what God made us correct
[2:41:18.540 --> 2:41:27.220]  in our we are not our DNA our codon 97% of our RNA is never translated into
[2:41:27.220 --> 2:41:33.100]  proteins it's message it's regulatory it tells it sends the fire trucks to the
[2:41:33.100 --> 2:41:39.420]  fire as I like to say your immune cells why are they targeting brown people
[2:41:39.420 --> 2:41:45.980]  because they've been experimenting on on them for four decades like HIV AIDS so
[2:41:45.980 --> 2:41:51.860]  athletes Magic Johnson that's why I show that he my PhD thesis committee said
[2:41:51.860 --> 2:41:56.180]  based on your thesis Willie or Willie not die of AIDS and I said he'll never get
[2:41:56.180 --> 2:41:59.940]  it but he's got to change everything we were doing and this is where Mickey
[2:41:59.940 --> 2:42:05.220]  Willis said in that movie my brother died of AZT and I said don't you mean AIDS
[2:42:05.220 --> 2:42:10.140]  and this is 2019 and I didn't know because I made these drugs and he was
[2:42:10.140 --> 2:42:14.740]  seropositive antibody dependent enhancement so everybody who is
[2:42:14.740 --> 2:42:22.980]  infected and immune by their God-given immunity will die from the shots so all
[2:42:22.980 --> 2:42:29.020]  of the kids that have been mandated and injured by the vaccines not just blacks
[2:42:29.020 --> 2:42:33.940]  but ever they've they've targeted diabetes all of the susceptible the fat
[2:42:33.940 --> 2:42:38.540]  the glyphosate poisoning the lack of cannabis in our environment the one of
[2:42:38.540 --> 2:42:44.620]  the most potent detoxifying plants for for heavy metals in our soil which we
[2:42:44.620 --> 2:42:48.580]  know all the aluminum in the shot Dr. Michael bits stay there that you are

[2:47:17.420 --> 2:47:21.140]  Dr. Judy Michael this is our guest the head of Mike Adams taken over the 4th
[2:47:21.140 --> 2:47:26.860]  hour and Owen Shroyer 3 p.m. Central the war room today on the vaunted info wars
[2:47:26.860 --> 2:47:30.980]  dot com all our great radio and TV affiliates we're so thankful for you and
[2:47:30.980 --> 2:47:34.580]  all the great folks spread the articles and videos this interview that's live
[2:47:34.580 --> 2:47:39.020]  right now will be archived later the band video you can't share that URL
[2:47:39.020 --> 2:47:43.420]  because it's a censorship but the new URL that mirrors the site to share is the
[2:47:43.420 --> 2:47:50.500]  info war dot TV the info war dot TV so please share that and they'll ban that
[2:47:50.500 --> 2:47:55.860]  soon of a new URL dr. Michael it's big picture you've given a science you've
[2:47:55.860 --> 2:47:59.260]  given us background people can search anything you say and find it but big
[2:47:59.260 --> 2:48:03.140]  picture how was their attack going how was their next push for new lockdowns
[2:48:03.140 --> 2:48:07.660]  forced inoculations with these cancer injections how was the program going for
[2:48:07.660 --> 2:48:13.980]  the New World Order right so it's not so they got caught they know it what most
[2:48:13.980 --> 2:48:19.940]  people now realize is don't get another shot I mean no shot I just showed you
[2:48:19.940 --> 2:48:24.100]  they were all I was remit nobody will take it and nobody ever took it in a
[2:48:24.100 --> 2:48:29.500]  bunch of countries nobody's taken them to throw it away no but but also never
[2:48:29.500 --> 2:48:35.540]  another vaccine not a polio shot not an MMR not they've all been synthetic
[2:48:35.540 --> 2:48:40.820]  poisons they since that's why I showed you all those viruses they've been in
[2:48:40.820 --> 2:48:46.900]  those cell lines continuously growing in our lab for 50 years we've got them in
[2:48:46.900 --> 2:48:52.580]  freezers we grow them up I can prove Omicron was in humans including me and
[2:48:52.580 --> 2:49:01.220]  my husband in 2000 and in 2010 we zero converted and created antibodies so the
[2:49:01.220 --> 2:49:06.340]  real important endgame is they've got to get everybody injected because then the
[2:49:06.340 --> 2:49:10.980]  rest of your environment your food and your particulates is poison and so this
[2:49:10.980 --> 2:49:17.100]  is why I talk about serum and because it's a drug of of Monsanto Bayer talk
[2:49:17.100 --> 2:49:20.740]  about what you're saying is I'm on a scientist is they've merged immortal
[2:49:20.740 --> 2:49:27.500]  cell line viruses with spike protein as the infectious delivery system correct
[2:49:27.500 --> 2:49:32.380]  they've they're creating the spike proteins in the cell lines they don't
[2:49:32.380 --> 2:49:37.500]  have to merge they've been do we've been doing this since the 60s these cell
[2:49:37.500 --> 2:49:43.180]  lines have been growing in our lab since the 60s so we've been experimenting
[2:49:43.180 --> 2:49:48.260]  various viruses and seeing if you could add them what they do what they do to
[2:49:48.260 --> 2:49:51.340]  humans and lab rats what do you expect to happen the public this main line
[2:49:51.340 --> 2:49:55.780]  insurance companies are seeing a 40% increase in death that's exactly what
[2:49:55.780 --> 2:50:01.380]  we expect in the heavily vaccinated but the way to solve the problem is never
[2:50:01.380 --> 2:50:08.220]  again get another shot or take their contaminated products of Bayer Monsanto
[2:50:08.220 --> 2:50:15.440]  no more GMO not food every shot is a genetically modified organism every
[2:50:15.440 --> 2:50:19.700]  shot is gain a function every shot is synthetic they've always been that way
[2:50:19.700 --> 2:50:24.660]  they've lied to us and look how healthy we are if we eat clean food so the last
[2:50:24.660 --> 2:50:30.620]  picture the call to action is in slide 69 but just go to slide 70 because what
[2:50:30.620 --> 2:50:37.420]  we show you is when you walk away from them and in that little boy with the
[2:50:37.420 --> 2:50:44.380]  monkey pox all we did was give him clean food and products like the Zelenko's
[2:50:44.380 --> 2:50:51.500]  East Act this was a slide I made in 2019 I'm standing there trying to stop them
[2:50:51.500 --> 2:50:56.300]  from inoculating the vaccine injured that's children who already have
[2:50:56.300 --> 2:51:01.420]  seizures and and I'm on a street corner in Oxnard where they're forcing it on
[2:51:01.420 --> 2:51:06.940]  these children with the criminal bills of Newsom and Senator Pan the we knew
[2:51:06.940 --> 2:51:11.900]  they were trying to kill our kids but the last in all of these corrupt people
[2:51:11.900 --> 2:51:16.860]  if that had happened we would never had COVID every single piece of data I'm
[2:51:16.860 --> 2:51:23.380]  showing you we had in 2014 and presented to the FBI and presented to the Ninth
[2:51:23.380 --> 2:51:27.980]  Circuit Court the Attorney General and they did nothing except pay off the
[2:51:27.980 --> 2:51:32.660]  criminals and that's what I totally agree talk about Fauci but you predicted
[2:51:32.660 --> 2:51:36.660]  it happened it's on record the research is there but you said they're caught I
[2:51:36.660 --> 2:51:40.700]  agree the world's waking up to them what do you expect them to pull next another
[2:51:40.700 --> 2:51:45.740]  bioweapon release they've cooked up in a lab the only way they can do that is is
[2:51:45.740 --> 2:51:51.420]  by injecting it it's already in the lab so look at the last slide I don't care
[2:51:51.420 --> 2:51:57.340]  what they do next because it's in our control if we walk away that's that same
[2:51:57.340 --> 2:52:03.580]  little boy all we gave them was clean food similar to one of the products you
[2:52:03.580 --> 2:52:09.620]  just showed where it's a it's they've poisoned our food they poison our animal
[2:52:09.620 --> 2:52:16.580]  they admit it look at slide 68 when we were getting a religious exemptions as
[2:52:16.580 --> 2:52:23.860]  under our Constitution look at slide 68 the form that Bayer Monsanto sent to the
[2:52:23.860 --> 2:52:29.060]  people oh we understand you have a problem with us using a boarded fetal
[2:52:29.060 --> 2:52:37.140]  cell lines in injections as or in the purity of the body your belief in the
[2:52:37.140 --> 2:52:43.060]  purity of the body here's every product that you eat that you take that Bayer
[2:52:43.060 --> 2:52:48.900]  makes and he said it's not exhaustive aspirin benadryl malox they're all
[2:52:48.900 --> 2:52:55.380]  loaded with a boarded fetal cell line with sincitin with the central peptide
[2:52:55.380 --> 2:53:02.980]  component of snake venom that humans have an odd have a a natural God-given
[2:53:02.980 --> 2:53:08.660]  immune response to it's called human endogenous retrovirus w it's the proof
[2:53:08.660 --> 2:53:14.660]  that God's immunity is all you need they can't hack our chromosomes unless they
[2:53:14.660 --> 2:53:20.860]  inject it or we keep ingesting the poison they're poisoning our food as
[2:53:20.860 --> 2:53:25.980]  you're saying all we have to do is turn away every human being I'm infected with
[2:53:25.980 --> 2:53:30.540]  all of these things I have Ebola I have everything I have antibodies to them I'm
[2:53:30.540 --> 2:53:35.100]  immune you never inject an AIDS patient with anything because you'll spread AIDS
[2:53:35.100 --> 2:53:40.100]  through his body and through his family's bodies and that's what the papers and
[2:53:40.100 --> 2:53:44.700]  that's what everything says here they knew they got the healthcare worker six
[2:53:44.700 --> 2:53:50.020]  nobody wears a mask it destroys your own immune system there's nothing about any
[2:53:50.020 --> 2:53:55.100]  of this that is safe comfortable or anybody explain that wearing a mask makes
[2:53:55.100 --> 2:54:01.220]  your body turn off its immune system because you're hypoxic hypoxia inducible
[2:54:01.220 --> 2:54:07.420]  factor 1 alpha is an on-off switch a blowtorch on cancer sincitin is a
[2:54:07.420 --> 2:54:14.500]  fusagenic peptide that fuses together cancer cells the XMRVs have a mouse
[2:54:14.500 --> 2:54:20.460]  sincitin your own body says that's not me that's mouse autoimmune diseases we
[2:54:20.460 --> 2:54:24.980]  can't tell the difference between self and non-self you never inject anything
[2:54:24.980 --> 2:54:29.020]  on the first day of life because it dysregulates the expression of your
[2:54:29.020 --> 2:54:32.500]  that's right why don't babies get sick for six months it's a yeah but you
[2:54:32.500 --> 2:54:37.340]  inject them it just destabilizes that right and you never inject in pregnancy
[2:54:37.340 --> 2:54:43.740]  and everything here shows you how they've been trying to experiment by
[2:54:43.740 --> 2:54:48.180]  injecting pregnant women and and injecting and so they finish their
[2:54:48.180 --> 2:54:53.660]  experiments they know from this shot that they got it so now it's kill
[2:54:53.660 --> 2:54:59.260]  everybody call it COVID cremate them so you don't have the sequences and we
[2:54:59.260 --> 2:55:04.860]  can't we can show you in this book we can show you in these books we have
[2:55:04.860 --> 2:55:12.100]  freezers full of the cell lines that we handed the FBI in 2014 and they did
[2:55:12.100 --> 2:55:18.700]  nothing except cover it up president Obama led the way to murder these people
[2:55:18.700 --> 2:55:22.740]  that's what the crimes against humanity are Fauci knows exactly what they're
[2:55:22.740 --> 2:55:27.060]  doing they're poisoning our food they're every one of these shots is poison
[2:55:27.060 --> 2:55:32.740]  but if we all turn away and turn back to God we don't believe in their God our
[2:55:32.740 --> 2:55:38.420]  cult is not scientism we believe in our God yes we believe in the purity of the
[2:55:38.420 --> 2:55:42.420]  body and no you're not ever touching maybe again and then they don't pull
[2:55:42.420 --> 2:55:47.780]  anything monkeypox has been there since 2011 I just showed you the slide in
[2:55:47.780 --> 2:55:54.580]  every polio vaccine and most people are just fine stop people just walk away and

[2:55:58.980 --> 2:56:04.420]  to Fauci or any other one-world order they cannot hack our genome unless you

[3:06:24.820 --> 3:06:30.180]  course check out that new third silver coin and based on what I think is going
[3:06:30.180 --> 3:06:35.220]  to happen just with the price of silver by the way the value of silver those
[3:06:35.220 --> 3:06:39.180]  coins are going to be worth in my opinion far more than you pay for them
[3:06:39.180 --> 3:06:43.700]  even I mean just just the silver the raw silver itself is going to be worth
[3:06:43.700 --> 3:06:47.660]  far definitely check those out I do have Steve quail coming up here in just a
[3:06:47.660 --> 3:06:52.140]  couple of minutes I have a few other comments to offer first about the
[3:06:52.140 --> 3:06:57.940]  shooting in Uvaldi and some very critical comments about that and because
[3:06:57.940 --> 3:07:03.180]  I've got some critical things to say here I do want to just say up front that
[3:07:03.180 --> 3:07:08.580]  what I'm about to say these are my own opinions okay these are not positions
[3:07:08.580 --> 3:07:14.340]  of infjones and I'm not on the payroll I'm not an employee I have some
[3:07:14.340 --> 3:07:18.420]  opinions I'm very respectful of law enforcement in general but there are some
[3:07:18.420 --> 3:07:23.660]  major failures that took place here that we have to talk about but first the
[3:07:23.660 --> 3:07:29.420]  insane leftists who two weeks ago or two or three weeks ago whatever it was they
[3:07:29.420 --> 3:07:33.580]  were in front of the Supreme Court advocating for abortion they were
[3:07:33.580 --> 3:07:37.260]  chanting essentially you know kill the babies kill the babies kill the babies and
[3:07:37.260 --> 3:07:42.380]  now this weekend in front of the NRA they're gonna be screaming baby killers
[3:07:42.380 --> 3:07:46.740]  baby killers baby killers I mean do they ever look at themselves if you want to
[3:07:46.740 --> 3:07:52.660]  look at who's killing babies and children in America it is the left it is the
[3:07:52.660 --> 3:07:59.180]  abortion factories okay in fact on the same day that this Uvaldi shooting took
[3:07:59.180 --> 3:08:03.340]  place and in no way am I trying to minimize that shooting it was a horrible
[3:08:03.340 --> 3:08:08.940]  tragedy children died teachers died it was horrific but on that very same day
[3:08:08.940 --> 3:08:14.420]  do you realize there were far more children killed via abortion than died
[3:08:14.420 --> 3:08:19.380]  in that school that's right I mean we're talking more than ten times as many
[3:08:19.380 --> 3:08:24.420]  depending on estimates it could be more than a hundred times as many children
[3:08:24.420 --> 3:08:28.620]  killed via the abortion centers in the United States alone compared to what
[3:08:28.620 --> 3:08:33.620]  happened in that in that school again not to minimize that we must protect the
[3:08:33.620 --> 3:08:38.500]  children but we must protect all children because all the lives of children
[3:08:38.500 --> 3:08:44.100]  matter including the lives of unborn children why does the left scream and
[3:08:44.100 --> 3:08:50.740]  cry about a shooting but not the dismemberment of children in the womb or
[3:08:50.740 --> 3:08:56.340]  as they're being born or after they're born think about that now a couple of
[3:08:56.340 --> 3:09:03.180]  notes here too we live in a nation now that cannot feed its babies and cannot
[3:09:03.180 --> 3:09:08.420]  protect its children this is the collapse of society how is it that we
[3:09:08.420 --> 3:09:12.900]  can't feed our babies well it's because of the FDA protectionism the cartels
[3:09:12.900 --> 3:09:18.420]  over the infant formula the lack of free market dynamics it's the corruption of
[3:09:18.420 --> 3:09:22.180]  the government and then how is it that we can't protect our children in these
[3:09:22.180 --> 3:09:28.700]  schools again in my opinion corruption incompetence and that's not I don't
[3:09:28.700 --> 3:09:32.620]  assign that to every member of law enforcement I am pro police I am pro
[3:09:32.620 --> 3:09:39.580]  men and women in blue I am pro veteran sorry I had a little too spicy of a
[3:09:39.580 --> 3:09:44.140]  smoothie going on there before the show I support the men and women in blue but
[3:09:44.140 --> 3:09:50.340]  when you have these failures that took place it is inexplicable you have who's
[3:09:50.340 --> 3:09:56.700]  who's the guy's name Lieutenant Chris Olivares the Texas DPS spokesperson on
[3:09:56.700 --> 3:10:03.180]  CNN saying today this morning I believe it was they are hearing gunshots they're
[3:10:03.180 --> 3:10:06.700]  receiving gunshots at that point if they proceeded any further not knowing where
[3:10:06.700 --> 3:10:10.780]  the suspect was at they could have been shot they could have been killed he's
[3:10:10.780 --> 3:10:13.620]  talking about law enforcement they could have been shot they could have been
[3:10:13.620 --> 3:10:17.420]  killed and at that point that gunman would have had an opportunity to kill
[3:10:17.420 --> 3:10:25.060]  other people inside that school well Lieutenant Chris Olivares I hope that
[3:10:25.060 --> 3:10:29.980]  you are I hope that you retract that statement because if it is seriously
[3:10:29.980 --> 3:10:33.620]  your position that members of law enforcement should never enter a
[3:10:33.620 --> 3:10:41.300]  dangerous situation until it is secured by someone else why are they carrying a
[3:10:41.300 --> 3:10:46.700]  badge and a gun why are they wearing the uniform because by your logic Lieutenant
[3:10:46.700 --> 3:10:53.940]  Chris Olivares firefighters should also say I suppose well we we can't go into
[3:10:53.940 --> 3:10:59.940]  that burning building we might get burned or or soldiers might say well we
[3:10:59.940 --> 3:11:04.020]  can't go on to that battlefield we might take artillery fire or something is
[3:11:04.020 --> 3:11:08.260]  this really the position of law enforcement in Texas no less and this
[3:11:08.260 --> 3:11:14.460]  was my criticism again I'm pro law enforcement and I'm a Texan and I love
[3:11:14.460 --> 3:11:17.660]  Texas and I love the fact that law enforcement works so hard to keep us
[3:11:17.660 --> 3:11:21.540]  safe and most of them they do put themselves in harm's way but to say
[3:11:21.540 --> 3:11:26.620]  we couldn't follow that shooter into that school we couldn't move to the sound
[3:11:26.620 --> 3:11:31.540]  of the gunfire because we might be shot are you kidding me you outnumbered the
[3:11:31.540 --> 3:11:37.140]  kid you outnumbered him have you ever heard of fire and maneuver it's it is
[3:11:37.140 --> 3:11:41.420]  inexplicable that this has happened so what I want to do now I want to bring on
[3:11:41.420 --> 3:11:48.660]  Steve quail and ask him for his reaction to this situation now Steve first of all
[3:11:48.660 --> 3:11:52.140]  are you are you with us yes Mike I'm here
[3:11:52.140 --> 3:11:57.020]  excellent excellent thank you for coming on you have predicted so much of what
[3:11:57.020 --> 3:12:01.460]  we're seeing now even going back many years and you in your radio days and
[3:12:01.460 --> 3:12:05.500]  your books and your work and so on I really respect your work now you've
[3:12:05.500 --> 3:12:08.700]  got some new breaking information to share with us as well as one of the
[3:12:08.700 --> 3:12:13.380]  reasons why I wanted to have you on what is your take on this how can we be
[3:12:13.380 --> 3:12:18.940]  hearing from a police or law enforcement or DPS in Texas to say well we couldn't
[3:12:18.940 --> 3:12:24.460]  follow the gunfire because we could have been shot really well I think it should
[3:12:24.460 --> 3:12:29.100]  be DBS not DPS okay because this whole thing has got an ever-changing
[3:12:29.100 --> 3:12:34.300]  narrative in my opinion again I speak only for myself not Alex not in fours
[3:12:34.300 --> 3:12:38.340]  but this is my personal opinion based on people that were immediately in
[3:12:38.340 --> 3:12:42.900]  contact with a mutual friend of ours Mike that they heard that there were
[3:12:42.900 --> 3:12:46.940]  multiple shooters now listen there were over a hundred to a hundred and fifty
[3:12:46.940 --> 3:12:52.540]  officers there and I think that it's it's it's criminal that they're trying
[3:12:52.540 --> 3:12:58.580]  to justify their cowardice look a 19 that kid shot for 12 minutes before he
[3:12:58.580 --> 3:13:03.180]  entered the building so they should not have a badge they should not have a gun
[3:13:03.180 --> 3:13:08.220]  and ladies and gentlemen everything gonna see is a false flag spinning of
[3:13:08.220 --> 3:13:12.220]  advance and we need to really pray for the gentleman that had the balls and the
[3:13:12.220 --> 3:13:16.420]  guts to go in there when he did and take out Ramos because I can tell you Mike
[3:13:16.420 --> 3:13:22.940]  these people that are involved trying to save lives disappear and and I'm
[3:13:22.940 --> 3:13:26.700]  serious about that now two things that probably have just broken that most
[3:13:26.700 --> 3:13:30.140]  people don't understand and I didn't know it until about an hour ago courtesy
[3:13:30.140 --> 3:13:34.860]  of justice night Texas government texted a friend that he had shot his
[3:13:34.860 --> 3:13:39.380]  grandmother and was about to go shoot up a school that's from the New York Times
[3:13:39.380 --> 3:13:45.140]  and the thing is that's more provocative is that the safety officer had left a
[3:13:45.140 --> 3:13:50.540]  door open that the shooter had gone in through ladies and gentlemen this sounds
[3:13:50.540 --> 3:13:56.180]  like a mini version of the Capitol when everything was set up to allow this to
[3:13:56.180 --> 3:14:00.820]  happen and everything from a law enforcement standpoint was designed to
[3:14:00.820 --> 3:14:05.620]  just let it go on and I think my person I think the blood I think the blood of
[3:14:05.620 --> 3:14:09.820]  those little kids those children are on the hands of those and you know a friend
[3:14:09.820 --> 3:14:15.060]  of mine said this you can't impart bravery so this is what I think is
[3:14:15.060 --> 3:14:19.740]  happening this is a direct underscoring of the point that people are losing
[3:14:19.740 --> 3:14:25.540]  faith and rightly so in a lot of law enforcement because this is a perfect
[3:14:25.540 --> 3:14:29.580]  example look they go through training and they better know how to use a firearm
[3:14:29.580 --> 3:14:34.780]  but this thing has to do let me let me jump in here I I really appreciate
[3:14:34.780 --> 3:14:37.300]  everything that you said as well and what I got a lot more to cover with you I
[3:14:37.300 --> 3:14:42.140]  just want to clarify something that you know when when you you use the phrase
[3:14:42.140 --> 3:14:46.300]  false flag I want to make sure and I think you and I both agree on this in no
[3:14:46.300 --> 3:14:49.780]  way are you saying that no one was shot or that no one died what you're saying
[3:14:49.780 --> 3:14:53.980]  is that this appears to have been a stand down order where law enforcement was
[3:14:53.980 --> 3:14:57.660]  ordered to stand down is that correct is that is that a clarification that makes
[3:14:57.660 --> 3:15:01.220]  sense those children were burned I think that this is going to be the
[3:15:01.220 --> 3:15:04.780]  escalation now isn't it interesting to Mike that this is what we are warned
[3:15:04.780 --> 3:15:09.740]  about that ISIS was going to do remember the days that there was going to be you
[3:15:09.740 --> 3:15:16.180]  know shooters that would be taking out school children and again when I say
[3:15:16.180 --> 3:15:20.460]  false flag thank you for defining it but I'm talking about there are too many
[3:15:20.460 --> 3:15:26.420]  subtleties and in your face issues that need to be answered and the main one is
[3:15:26.420 --> 3:15:32.500]  and this is this is really critical who gave the order to the sheriffs to stand
[3:15:32.500 --> 3:15:37.620]  down now there's exactly stories and the thing is is that ladies and gentlemen I
[3:15:37.620 --> 3:15:43.460]  don't know the nature and makeup of you vaudey County so we we gotta go to
[3:15:43.460 --> 3:15:46.540]  break I apologize for cutting off we gotta go to break stay with us here
[3:15:46.540 --> 3:15:50.500]  Steve we'll be right back after this break you're watching of the Alex
[3:15:50.500 --> 3:15:54.940]  Jones show on info wars.com we'll be right back
[3:15:55.740 --> 3:16:01.580]  the globalist are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[3:16:01.580 --> 3:16:06.180]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're
[3:16:06.180 --> 3:16:09.860]  doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of God the
[3:16:09.860 --> 3:16:16.060]  creator and we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much so
[3:16:16.060 --> 3:16:19.540]  that's why I repeat that famous Internet saying that nobody knows who first
[3:16:19.540 --> 3:16:26.500]  came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be necessary if the
[3:16:26.500 --> 3:16:31.900]  situation was hopeless they need all the propaganda and all their lies and all
[3:16:31.900 --> 3:16:38.300]  their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they
[3:16:38.300 --> 3:16:42.460]  know in the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser and that's
[3:16:42.460 --> 3:16:45.460]  why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than
[3:16:45.460 --> 3:16:49.700]  ever because even you don't believe in God but the globalist are manifesting
[3:16:49.700 --> 3:16:54.620]  setting up and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the

[3:20:11.380 --> 3:20:17.620]  we now take you live to the central Texas Command Center in the heart of the
[3:20:17.620 --> 3:20:27.020]  resistance it's Mike Adams you're listening to the Alex Jones show you
[3:20:27.020 --> 3:20:30.460]  know it's extraordinary folks and we're joined here by Steve Quayle this is
[3:20:30.460 --> 3:20:33.660]  going to be a very powerful hour but it's extraordinary that we live in a
[3:20:33.660 --> 3:20:38.180]  world where as I said earlier in the United States we can't seem to feed our
[3:20:38.180 --> 3:20:44.100]  babies our infants and we can't protect our children and we have police at least
[3:20:44.100 --> 3:20:48.420]  some police I'm not I'm not badgering all police by any means but some police
[3:20:48.420 --> 3:20:55.420]  who are afraid to do their jobs because they might get shot and look the good
[3:20:55.420 --> 3:20:58.700]  news is I've heard from a lot of my friends who are cops who are retired
[3:20:58.700 --> 3:21:03.660]  veterans you know some active duty and so on and they they all agree with me and
[3:21:03.660 --> 3:21:07.340]  they they say this is unacceptable this is not the way we've been trained this
[3:21:07.340 --> 3:21:10.420]  is not what we would have done in that situation we would not have stood down so
[3:21:10.420 --> 3:21:15.380]  I want to say pro law enforcement every every person I've heard from today
[3:21:15.380 --> 3:21:21.820]  personally is also appalled at this situation but to say that you can't go
[3:21:21.820 --> 3:21:25.180]  into a scene that you can't follow an active shooter because you might get
[3:21:25.180 --> 3:21:32.940]  shot let me tell you you men in blue who who said that you should turn in your
[3:21:32.940 --> 3:21:37.620]  badge turn in your gun take off that uniform because it's not a uniform for
[3:21:37.620 --> 3:21:43.060]  you you're wearing a costume if you don't have the heart of a police officer
[3:21:43.060 --> 3:21:47.620]  or the heart of a SWAT team operator or the heart of someone to go into combat
[3:21:47.620 --> 3:21:53.740]  and chase down bad guys and follow the gunfire to its origin and take out that
[3:21:53.740 --> 3:21:58.180]  guy which the US Border Patrol agent did he's got the heart of law enforcement
[3:21:58.180 --> 3:22:03.740]  that we need but these other cops or patrols whoever else it was standing
[3:22:03.740 --> 3:22:08.340]  around you should resign and we should have an investigation I'm calling on
[3:22:08.340 --> 3:22:12.860]  Attorney General Paxton and Governor Abbott we must launch an investigation
[3:22:12.860 --> 3:22:18.380]  was there a stand-down order was there corruption was somebody doing this on
[3:22:18.380 --> 3:22:22.420]  purpose to make the massacre worse was somebody in the chain of command who's
[3:22:22.420 --> 3:22:27.060]  pulling for gun control hmm there's a question this needs to be investigated
[3:22:27.060 --> 3:22:30.460]  because this is not the way law enforcement have been trained this is
[3:22:30.460 --> 3:22:35.140]  not the proper response and at least I understand that who is it
[3:22:35.140 --> 3:22:40.980]  a craw I believe has it takes made so good on him for admitting it but this is
[3:22:40.980 --> 3:22:45.900]  entirely unacceptable and one final comment and I'll go to Steve here you
[3:22:45.900 --> 3:22:50.020]  know we're talking about monkey pox and and animals and everything I gotta say
[3:22:50.020 --> 3:22:57.420]  even monkeys will rush to save their children even gorillas even dogs will
[3:22:57.420 --> 3:23:02.380]  rush to save their children and that's what even you know good-hearted human
[3:23:02.380 --> 3:23:05.580]  beings will of course rush to save their children one of the moms rushed in
[3:23:05.580 --> 3:23:09.900]  there grabbed her children and got him out of there and we've heard there's an
[3:23:09.900 --> 3:23:14.620]  MSN news story that says some of the cops went in and got their children out
[3:23:14.620 --> 3:23:19.820]  but the parents were stopped from doing the same thing let me tell you this
[3:23:19.820 --> 3:23:24.420]  situation would have gone better if no cops had shown up at all and if the armed
[3:23:24.420 --> 3:23:29.220]  citizens had actually taken matters into their own hands in this situation this
[3:23:29.220 --> 3:23:34.060]  particular situation it would have gone better because the parents knew what to
[3:23:34.060 --> 3:23:40.140]  do and the cops were standing around holding their their their their bleep
[3:23:40.140 --> 3:23:44.540]  yeah with with their bleeps in their hands in the parking lot okay so that's
[3:23:44.540 --> 3:23:49.780]  my take on that Steve quail you heard me criticize a very strongly law
[3:23:49.780 --> 3:23:54.380]  enforcement there for their mistakes what is your take on this and how can we
[3:23:54.380 --> 3:23:59.740]  do better well first of all I think this is why the second amendment exists I
[3:23:59.740 --> 3:24:03.940]  think it's really critical Mike that people understand they think that calling
[3:24:03.940 --> 3:24:09.140]  the police in a crisis situation is going to save them by the presence of so
[3:24:09.140 --> 3:24:13.100]  many federal officers and by the way there are eyewitness reports now of
[3:24:13.100 --> 3:24:17.420]  certain black cars that fit the typical espionage scenario being there I
[3:24:17.420 --> 3:24:23.100]  believe this was totally an MK ultra if you will not when I say false flag I
[3:24:23.100 --> 3:24:27.980]  want the better term for that is it was designed to kill children I want
[3:24:27.980 --> 3:24:31.700]  everybody knows something these people a lot of them are not saying I can't point
[3:24:31.700 --> 3:24:35.100]  my fingers at anybody but it's interesting that the blood of innocent
[3:24:35.100 --> 3:24:41.380]  children usually precedes some really really big event that's going to happen
[3:24:41.380 --> 3:24:45.180]  and the blood of the innocence this is what we're talking about we're talking
[3:24:45.180 --> 3:24:49.980]  about innocence of those children and the cowardice of the cops and I would say
[3:24:49.980 --> 3:24:54.500]  and I would call for it and I am calling for a full-scale investigation by an
[3:24:54.500 --> 3:24:59.540]  independent group of group it three people four people chosen for their
[3:24:59.540 --> 3:25:07.100]  expertise because this is absolutely how do I say that it is so world nerve
[3:25:07.100 --> 3:25:12.020]  racking because the cowardice but Mike's they were ordered to stand down okay I
[3:25:12.020 --> 3:25:16.180]  know they were ordered to stand down I think they need to investigate the
[3:25:16.180 --> 3:25:20.580]  sheriff I think they need to know his political positions I think they need to
[3:25:20.580 --> 3:25:25.580]  know is he a constitutional sheriff or not the information I don't know but the
[3:25:25.580 --> 3:25:29.660]  information I've been given is he's not the information I've been given is he
[3:25:29.660 --> 3:25:33.500]  wouldn't even join with the sheriffs in Texas Sheriff Scott you got some great
[3:25:33.500 --> 3:25:39.160]  great sheriffs I moved to Texas but the point is yeah when you see the head
[3:25:39.160 --> 3:25:43.580]  like now just turn it right back to you police slow to engage slow they did not
[3:25:43.580 --> 3:25:48.020]  engage and when they say police what they're doing is they're mixing different
[3:25:48.020 --> 3:25:52.420]  organizations and thank God for the Border Patrol and you know I'd give that
[3:25:52.420 --> 3:25:57.900]  guy a hug and I'd also say that guy should be sheriff yeah well well said
[3:25:57.900 --> 3:26:01.220]  Steven and I want to say to those of you in law enforcement who are watching
[3:26:01.220 --> 3:26:05.700]  especially if we're talking about you those those few who stood around and
[3:26:05.700 --> 3:26:10.820]  did not go in this isn't just armchair quarterbacking I know Steve Quayle has
[3:26:10.820 --> 3:26:16.020]  experienced a lot a lot of experience with teams and firearms and you know I
[3:26:16.020 --> 3:26:21.980]  myself thousands of hours of training I've been trained by cops by spec ops by
[3:26:21.980 --> 3:26:27.660]  Navy SEALs I've done scenarios tubular assaults clearing buildings of active
[3:26:27.660 --> 3:26:31.540]  shooters I've done hostage rescue scenarios with with live firearms and
[3:26:31.540 --> 3:26:35.260]  also simulations I've been shot by simulations way too many times they
[3:26:35.260 --> 3:26:40.580]  hurt I've been carrying concealed weapons longer than some of you young
[3:26:40.580 --> 3:26:44.860]  law enforcement guys have ever been alive okay I'm older than I look we this is
[3:26:44.860 --> 3:26:50.620]  not just armchair quarterbacking I know what it takes to engage a bad guy and
[3:26:50.620 --> 3:26:55.060]  go in and pull the trigger if you have to to save lives and put yourself in
[3:26:55.060 --> 3:26:59.620]  harm's asking too much from law enforcement are we Steve I mean isn't
[3:26:59.620 --> 3:27:03.980]  that their job when they sign the bottom line that I want to be a cop aren't they
[3:27:03.980 --> 3:27:08.980]  also signing that I'm gonna put myself in harm's way when necessary innocent
[3:27:08.980 --> 3:27:15.820]  lives well to protect and serve is basically the motto that law enforcement
[3:27:15.820 --> 3:27:20.900]  had pretty much I would say this incorporated but it changed dramatically
[3:27:20.900 --> 3:27:25.700]  and Mike the thing is look any anybody who I wouldn't want to see everybody's
[3:27:25.700 --> 3:27:30.820]  records qualifying on the range too I'd want to see the background information
[3:27:30.820 --> 3:27:35.220]  because I believe this was a ritual sacrifice okay I want to make it clear I
[3:27:35.220 --> 3:27:41.260]  believe it was a ritual sacrifice I believe the CIA let's call it like it
[3:27:41.260 --> 3:27:48.020]  is MK ultra they the head of you know the CIA made statements years ago that
[3:27:48.020 --> 3:27:51.580]  everything the American people will believe is a lie because they their
[3:27:51.580 --> 3:27:56.300]  effectiveness has been you know indisputable Bill Casey so I think that
[3:27:56.300 --> 3:27:59.500]  what people have got to see this is an attack on the Second Amendment I'm on
[3:27:59.500 --> 3:28:04.260]  record that we are seeing and I'm using this word historically and in context
[3:28:04.260 --> 3:28:08.900]  we're seeing a revolution we're seeing evil rewarded we're seeing good murdered
[3:28:08.900 --> 3:28:13.740]  and there's nobody coming to your rescue I'd encourage every woman every man
[3:28:13.740 --> 3:28:19.340]  every capable American citizen Texas citizen to learn how to handle a fire
[3:28:19.340 --> 3:28:24.700]  and not only to learn how to but take tactical classes because there's no one
[3:28:24.700 --> 3:28:30.180]  more I would say this in F number one there's no guarantee the Constitution the
[3:28:30.180 --> 3:28:34.620]  Supreme Court stated there's no guarantee and police are not required to go
[3:28:34.620 --> 3:28:38.620]  to your aid so these guys there you said it Steve again I apologize for
[3:28:38.620 --> 3:28:41.460]  interrupting again we're gonna go to break but you just said it the police
[3:28:41.460 --> 3:28:46.260]  aren't coming to save you folks even if they want to they're being ordered to
[3:28:46.260 --> 3:28:49.900]  stand down often they're not given training they're not giving the gear
[3:28:49.900 --> 3:28:53.220]  the police are not coming to save you you're gonna have to be your own police
[3:28:53.220 --> 3:28:57.140]  pro-second amendment we'll be back I want to thank all of you over the years

[3:33:24.260 --> 3:33:32.020]  you know it is it's really extraordinary folks when you think about this that we
[3:33:32.020 --> 3:33:36.860]  have arrived at a moment in time here in America when not only is the left
[3:33:36.860 --> 3:33:42.020]  screaming that all police are bad and that they should be defunded but then
[3:33:42.020 --> 3:33:47.940]  somehow in some sectors of law enforcement again not all but even in
[3:33:47.940 --> 3:33:54.020]  taxes some group of law enforcement have lost the will to fight and I don't know
[3:33:54.020 --> 3:33:57.940]  what's happening but I suspect it's something much bigger than funding I
[3:33:57.940 --> 3:34:02.420]  suspect it's something about the culture I think it's part of the the gender
[3:34:02.420 --> 3:34:06.340]  bender chemicals that are in the foods I think it's the plastics chemicals I
[3:34:06.340 --> 3:34:11.340]  think it's environmental pollution contamination and I think it's cultural
[3:34:11.340 --> 3:34:14.820]  programming and I think it's the fact that there have been so many attacks
[3:34:14.820 --> 3:34:19.700]  against police and so many videos that are criticizing them for doing their
[3:34:19.700 --> 3:34:24.700]  jobs that they are reluctant to do much of anything in a sense police have
[3:34:24.700 --> 3:34:30.380]  become paralyzed so you know I mean I'm criticizing them for not going in but
[3:34:30.380 --> 3:34:36.980]  at the same time they there's always there in in their own minds there's a
[3:34:36.980 --> 3:34:41.900]  risk of a backlash if they go in too hard or too aggressively because again
[3:34:41.900 --> 3:34:46.580]  because the left is so and so we're bringing back in Steve quail I forgot
[3:34:46.580 --> 3:34:51.660]  to mention a website Steve it's Steve quail.com great site lots of headlines
[3:34:51.660 --> 3:34:55.940]  every day of the breaking news items I check it every morning when I wake up
[3:34:55.940 --> 3:34:59.220]  I'm always checking a website Steve but see what do you think are the other
[3:34:59.220 --> 3:35:04.980]  factors contributing to all of this the the downfall of the the manliness if you
[3:35:04.980 --> 3:35:09.820]  will even in law enforcement well I think you nailed it Mike was you know
[3:35:09.820 --> 3:35:13.820]  estrogen you know it used to be in the old days water was in glass and there
[3:35:13.820 --> 3:35:18.540]  really is the estrogenation of the American males sperm counts are low
[3:35:18.540 --> 3:35:22.540]  obviously our ability to reproduce is becoming more and more negative and
[3:35:22.540 --> 3:35:27.940]  that's going to be insured in my opinion by the attack upon even infants not
[3:35:27.940 --> 3:35:32.740]  just the formula but everybody wanting to make sure that they can't reproduce so
[3:35:32.740 --> 3:35:36.700]  what we're watching and I want to make this clear as a systematic extinction of
[3:35:36.700 --> 3:35:42.260]  the human race and these type of instances a besmanop one of the first
[3:35:42.260 --> 3:35:47.260]  Russian defectors say they were going to do their best i.e. Russian Intel to turn
[3:35:47.260 --> 3:35:51.220]  the people against law enforcement the law enforcement against people and cause
[3:35:51.220 --> 3:35:56.020]  people lose all respect for the intelligence agencies we just had 61
[3:35:56.020 --> 3:36:00.860]  intelligence agents attest to the steel dossier that was real and every one of
[3:36:00.860 --> 3:36:06.060]  those guys was lying so there is no truth in my opinion in America any longer
[3:36:06.060 --> 3:36:11.140]  and Mike this is a good example I'm sorry to say a murderous example of them
[3:36:11.140 --> 3:36:16.140]  controlling the narrative to basically bring about you know when you control the
[3:36:16.140 --> 3:36:19.860]  narrative you control the result it's gun gun gun control and the only thing
[3:36:19.860 --> 3:36:23.860]  ladies and gentlemen standing between the complete destruction of you as an
[3:36:23.860 --> 3:36:28.020]  American citizen is your ability to defend yourself and I'm telling you point
[3:36:28.020 --> 3:36:32.060]  blank Mike you and I know this is that the will and I want to ask a question
[3:36:32.060 --> 3:36:37.540]  does America have the will to live and I'm not sure speaking and you know
[3:36:37.540 --> 3:36:42.500]  everybody can say what they think but where is the will well you're right on
[3:36:42.500 --> 3:36:47.340]  there Steve I mean where is our will to defend our own border where is the will
[3:36:47.340 --> 3:36:53.980]  to feed our children to you know to to just stand for a basic common sense that
[3:36:53.980 --> 3:36:58.100]  we see some good signs some parents a lot of backlash against the grooming
[3:36:58.100 --> 3:37:02.540]  indoctrination in our public schools for example we see a lot of backlash
[3:37:02.540 --> 3:37:06.580]  against these gun control efforts and and frankly if the if you could say
[3:37:06.580 --> 3:37:10.820]  there's a silver lining in this one of them is the fact that I haven't seen any
[3:37:10.820 --> 3:37:15.820]  real Americans change their position on the Second Amendment they if anything
[3:37:15.820 --> 3:37:19.580]  they're doubling down now more than ever to say we need the Second Amendment see
[3:37:19.580 --> 3:37:25.660]  the cops can't help you the cops aren't coming they just proved it you dial 911
[3:37:25.660 --> 3:37:30.140]  and you die you you better have your Glock you better have your rifle you
[3:37:30.140 --> 3:37:34.300]  better realistic backpack or something because the cops aren't coming to help
[3:37:34.300 --> 3:37:39.340]  you if not in Texas then where and by the way what are these cops claim that
[3:37:39.340 --> 3:37:44.780]  they're waiting for they say oh we can't rush shot who are you waiting for to
[3:37:44.780 --> 3:37:49.980]  make that scene safe so that you can enter are you waiting for Batman to come
[3:37:49.980 --> 3:37:53.420]  in and clear out the bad guy and then you can come in do the paperwork give me a
[3:37:53.420 --> 3:37:58.500]  break Steve your thoughts well first of all I think the whole thing is a
[3:37:58.500 --> 3:38:05.900]  reflection of the if you will the casual nature of death in America you talked
[3:38:05.900 --> 3:38:10.580]  about the children being aborted the children by the way 1.2 million kids
[3:38:10.580 --> 3:38:16.860]  disappear the entire blood thirstiness and I'm saying it blood lust of this
[3:38:16.860 --> 3:38:20.820]  country is becoming more deadly and dangerous and just like the picture of
[3:38:20.820 --> 3:38:25.980]  Molok and by the way it's interesting that Molok the people of the Canaanites
[3:38:25.980 --> 3:38:30.660]  would burn their children but we're seeing child sacrifice and I think that
[3:38:30.660 --> 3:38:34.140]  it's really interesting might because you can talk about spiritual warfare but
[3:38:34.140 --> 3:38:39.780]  one of the things that's really prominent is that Lucifer and his legions
[3:38:39.780 --> 3:38:44.660]  have been initiating human sacrifice so those 19 you little you know little
[3:38:44.660 --> 3:38:50.380]  those 19 young people they just had their lives snuffed out and I I'd say
[3:38:50.380 --> 3:38:55.620]  this the narrative about who could have done it it all falls flat because they
[3:38:55.620 --> 3:39:01.220]  didn't do what they could have done and people say to me well you know you've
[3:39:01.220 --> 3:39:04.620]  never been in a gunfight been in the middle of one between two and I only
[3:39:04.620 --> 3:39:09.660]  had to thank God but I mean you know you don't ever want to get in a crossfire
[3:39:09.660 --> 3:39:15.340]  and the thing turned out good but here's the thing the idea that someone's
[3:39:15.340 --> 3:39:20.500]  coming to help us is absolutely foreign to the pioneer spirit that made this
[3:39:20.500 --> 3:39:23.980]  country great and forget the word prepping forget the word survivalist
[3:39:23.980 --> 3:39:28.540]  it's the pioneer spirit and what's everything's happening Mike is to
[3:39:28.540 --> 3:39:34.380]  destroy the spirit of the American male the emasculation of the American male
[3:39:34.380 --> 3:39:37.940]  and I think what's important that people understand we're watching our own
[3:39:37.940 --> 3:39:44.740]  military be destroyed from within in my opinion we're watching Steve this I'm
[3:39:44.740 --> 3:39:50.540]  sorry I rub this is something I gotta ask you this you just hit it what happens
[3:39:50.540 --> 3:39:54.860]  to our military if we get into a war with Russia or if our military gets
[3:39:54.860 --> 3:39:59.180]  into a war with China or both of them at the same time because now we've seen
[3:39:59.180 --> 3:40:04.380]  these stand-down orders and this can I say this this lack of willingness to do
[3:40:04.380 --> 3:40:09.180]  their duty and place themselves in selves in harm's way at the police level
[3:40:09.180 --> 3:40:12.580]  is this going to happen in the military I mean I don't want to question a hundred
[3:40:12.580 --> 3:40:16.220]  percent support veterans and active duty military but the the leadership at the
[3:40:16.220 --> 3:40:20.700]  top of the Pentagon they seem to be sending out a message to say like it's
[3:40:20.700 --> 3:40:25.540]  bad to be a man it's bad to have courage it's bad to be strong and they're
[3:40:25.540 --> 3:40:28.580]  trying to sysify the ranks of the military I think they're gonna fail but
[3:40:28.580 --> 3:40:31.980]  that's what they're trying to do go ahead well I think they pretty much
[3:40:31.980 --> 3:40:37.580]  succeeded now I salute I mean that I've had a veterans ministry for a long time
[3:40:37.580 --> 3:40:42.780]  you know ten years at least and helping vets and stuff I've been a about but I
[3:40:42.780 --> 3:40:46.460]  want to say something and this is critical for people to understand the U.S.
[3:40:46.460 --> 3:40:52.580]  military is being destroyed from within in my opinion you cannot inoculate with
[3:40:52.580 --> 3:40:57.860]  forgive me a questionable non-scientific basis bunch of stuff shot
[3:40:57.860 --> 3:41:01.620]  under your body these men are only to lay down their lives maybe seals and
[3:41:01.620 --> 3:41:05.580]  others are suing the government and rightly so in my opinion but you can't
[3:41:05.580 --> 3:41:09.340]  expect someone that's willing to that's braver than brave to lay down their life
[3:41:09.340 --> 3:41:15.620]  and then tell the glove commits suicide or bats aside again we are an insane
[3:41:15.620 --> 3:41:20.020]  nation and when insanity grips a nation like this is all leading up to civil
[3:41:20.020 --> 3:41:23.900]  war it's the left to keep saying civil war it's none it's none of the quote
[3:41:23.900 --> 3:41:29.620]  my ilk you know or our ilk so this is where they want they want civil war but
[3:41:29.620 --> 3:41:32.780]  they want to disarm us and if people understood what the left has in a way of
[3:41:32.780 --> 3:41:37.540]  armament they would have their mind blown yeah and and you know I think it was
[3:41:37.540 --> 3:41:41.620]  last Friday I was hosting here as well with JR Nyquist and I interviewed Dr.
[3:41:41.620 --> 3:41:48.060]  Yan Li Meng that they had the audio out of China war generals talking about how
[3:41:48.060 --> 3:41:52.300]  they're going to invade the United States or at least it's it's assumed it's
[3:41:52.300 --> 3:41:56.940]  the United States because it's a massive well what happens if the U.S. is
[3:41:56.940 --> 3:42:02.140]  invaded or I mean what are cops the soldiers gonna say well it's not safe
[3:42:02.140 --> 3:42:08.580]  to fight back I mean we might be struck by artillery really you know Mike the
[3:42:08.580 --> 3:42:12.700]  Chinese white papers are all on record some of the most provocative statements
[3:42:12.700 --> 3:42:16.700]  that Chinese on record saying they have no qualms about killing every man woman
[3:42:16.700 --> 3:42:21.540]  in child in the United States the guy in the White House has made the state we're
[3:42:21.540 --> 3:42:24.700]  gonna go to war with Iran we're gonna go to war with China we're gonna go with
[3:42:24.700 --> 3:42:29.140]  war with Russia and also by the way we'll throw North Korea and these guys
[3:42:29.140 --> 3:42:34.540]  don't play in that kind of insane ballpark they're going to at some point
[3:42:34.540 --> 3:42:39.500]  react yeah well absolutely we're about to go to break again and we got one more

[3:47:22.700 --> 3:47:30.740]  to write a Babylon bee head said active school shooter asks dozens of law
[3:47:30.740 --> 3:47:37.020]  enforcement to wait in the parking lot while he massacres in a taxes you would
[3:47:37.020 --> 3:47:40.140]  think that's crazy that would never happen that's not even satire that's
[3:47:40.140 --> 3:47:43.620]  that's just a stupid idea never happened except it did happen I mean the
[3:47:43.620 --> 3:47:47.300]  Babylon bee can't even make this up I mean it's not that he asked law
[3:47:47.300 --> 3:47:52.820]  enforcement to wait but they waited and this this is the problem here in America
[3:47:52.820 --> 3:47:59.700]  we're fed this never-ending cascade of lies about firearms and guns and police
[3:47:59.700 --> 3:48:03.460]  protection look the police aren't going to protect you if you don't have your
[3:48:03.460 --> 3:48:08.220]  own self-defense you are vulnerable your well your community is vulnerable
[3:48:08.220 --> 3:48:14.060]  everybody in America who is legally able to do so should arm up right now
[3:48:14.060 --> 3:48:19.300]  legally and lawfully because the police are not coming to save you now we're
[3:48:19.300 --> 3:48:23.620]  joined by Steve Quayle from Steve quail.com I wanted to ask you Steve the
[3:48:23.620 --> 3:48:28.340]  Washington Post has now put out an article in zero hedge has covered it as
[3:48:28.340 --> 3:48:33.060]  well an article saying that the soldiers Ukrainian soldiers are in a state of
[3:48:33.060 --> 3:48:38.420]  morale collapse and supply chain collapse because well Russia is grinding
[3:48:38.420 --> 3:48:43.900]  them away day by day kilometer by kilometer frankly take taking the Donbass
[3:48:43.900 --> 3:48:47.100]  region and more so Steve what are your thoughts on that that seems like the
[3:48:47.100 --> 3:48:51.860]  fairy tale delusions that you know Ukraine is winning that's beginning to
[3:48:51.860 --> 3:48:55.380]  collapse even in the Western press what are your thoughts well the whole thing
[3:48:55.380 --> 3:48:59.220]  is a bad video game episode because a lot of the images that came out of the
[3:48:59.220 --> 3:49:04.340]  Ukraine supposedly winning were from video games literally so the idea is
[3:49:04.340 --> 3:49:07.580]  is how does somebody who's the president of a nation like that become a
[3:49:07.580 --> 3:49:12.660]  billionaire and why are American citizens paying double their gas prices
[3:49:12.660 --> 3:49:18.140]  food prices and listen reality we're we're up at least 25 to 30 percent and
[3:49:18.140 --> 3:49:21.940]  if you cut the short pack but here's the deal about Ukraine the Ukraine
[3:49:21.940 --> 3:49:27.740]  basically has figured out how to work the West in my opinion and when you're
[3:49:27.740 --> 3:49:34.820]  looking at this battle you're looking at a situation where NATO the US and look
[3:49:34.820 --> 3:49:40.300]  this isn't bashing America first but it is saying this we were the ones that
[3:49:40.300 --> 3:49:44.060]  opened up the hole we can use our nuclear weapons even today they were giving
[3:49:44.060 --> 3:49:49.420]  debating they the government giving them what more we've given 51,000 javelin
[3:49:49.420 --> 3:49:54.540]  you know shoulder filed shoulder fired or whatever stand fired missiles that's
[3:49:54.540 --> 3:49:58.780]  the whole US arsenal we're watching ladies and gentlemen the 95 billion
[3:49:58.780 --> 3:50:03.620]  Afghanistan who knows how many real billion it's depleting us so might you
[3:50:03.620 --> 3:50:07.100]  ask the question what happens when the Chinese invade well it's only the arms
[3:50:07.100 --> 3:50:11.340]  and the firearms and the arms of American citizens and you know I don't
[3:50:11.340 --> 3:50:14.700]  think people understand how close we are we're undergoing in my opinion a
[3:50:14.700 --> 3:50:19.500]  communist takeover and takedown and the disarmament of the American citizen
[3:50:19.500 --> 3:50:24.820]  will exacerbate the situation and it's they're going to be more children God
[3:50:24.820 --> 3:50:29.580]  bless the children please parents think twice about sending your kids to a
[3:50:29.580 --> 3:50:34.580]  volatile school you know home school and do anything but don't make them the
[3:50:34.580 --> 3:50:39.820]  little sacrifice sacrifices at these bloodthirsty people and Mike again I
[3:50:39.820 --> 3:50:44.060]  just got an email but we're on this podcast broadcast stating that another
[3:50:44.060 --> 3:50:47.700]  guy said look I've seen the numbers Steve this is a ritual sacrifice I sent it
[3:50:47.700 --> 3:50:53.020]  to you by the way so you could see it all right so well I'll take a look at
[3:50:53.020 --> 3:50:59.020]  that yeah back to Ukraine let me ask this Steve I'm sorry let me ask this it
[3:50:59.020 --> 3:51:03.260]  looks like the the European partners and you saw Henry Kissinger and you saw
[3:51:03.260 --> 3:51:07.220]  there from George Soros now freaked out about the possibility of Ukraine being
[3:51:07.220 --> 3:51:12.980]  lost Kissinger seems to be calling for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia I
[3:51:12.980 --> 3:51:17.580]  wouldn't be surprised if in the next 30 days we see actually Ukraine's military
[3:51:17.580 --> 3:51:24.300]  carry out a coup against Zelensky and arrest him for the needless killing of
[3:51:24.300 --> 3:51:28.580]  Ukrainian soldiers who are being given the most horrific orders to just stand
[3:51:28.580 --> 3:51:35.420]  and die and not maneuver and not retreat aren't we at really a possibility of the
[3:51:35.420 --> 3:51:41.620]  Ukrainian military collapsing surrendering to Russia in the next one to
[3:51:41.620 --> 3:51:45.380]  two months something like that what's your assessment well I think that could
[3:51:45.380 --> 3:51:49.740]  that could be you know a reasonable assumption Mike but then we've got to put
[3:51:49.740 --> 3:51:55.140]  in the whole provocation of wanting nuclear war George Soros wants a nuclear
[3:51:55.140 --> 3:52:00.660]  war there are others that want a nuclear war they really do want it all along the
[3:52:00.660 --> 3:52:05.340]  whole US defense posture and NATO's has been well Russia really won't use their
[3:52:05.340 --> 3:52:11.500]  nuclear weapons here's the thing we've got a microcosm in Ukraine of a greater
[3:52:11.500 --> 3:52:15.580]  conflict that's going on behind the scenes and in my opinion they may be
[3:52:15.580 --> 3:52:19.820]  overthrown or they could also be totally defeated and I'm not talking about an
[3:52:19.820 --> 3:52:26.420]  invasion when Poland if Poland and other if you will Western nations at least
[3:52:26.420 --> 3:52:30.060]  border nations go into the Ukraine I think you're gonna see Putin react a
[3:52:30.060 --> 3:52:34.020]  little differently and much more violently and again you know we have
[3:52:34.020 --> 3:52:40.420]  declared war on Russia let's just call it facts we have declared war on Russia
[3:52:40.420 --> 3:52:46.780]  and we have in essence had China declare war on us to quote it so we're at war
[3:52:46.780 --> 3:52:50.460]  ladies and gentlemen this isn't a skirmish Mike and I think that's what
[3:52:50.460 --> 3:52:55.340]  people are missing is a bigger picture this is leading up to a false war well
[3:52:55.340 --> 3:52:59.140]  a real World War three but it'll be a false Armageddon scenario and then
[3:52:59.140 --> 3:53:02.940]  we're gonna see the stuff happen that we've never seen and I would say this
[3:53:02.940 --> 3:53:08.140]  that please people pay attention do your own homework you know you can say
[3:53:08.140 --> 3:53:11.900]  although those guys are crazy but when people start throwing we're gonna throw
[3:53:11.900 --> 3:53:16.060]  our nukes at you before you throw our nukes at us and by the way you know when
[3:53:16.060 --> 3:53:20.340]  you're dealing with effective throw weight how many missiles and what the
[3:53:20.340 --> 3:53:24.700]  magnitude of the warheads are and etc right now the United States shouldn't be
[3:53:24.700 --> 3:53:29.100]  provoking a nuclear war with especially Russia and China and then throw North
[3:53:29.100 --> 3:53:34.500]  Korea into well exactly and you know Russia's nuclear force is modern it is
[3:53:34.500 --> 3:53:41.660]  advanced America's nuclear weapons are outdated some of them were built in the
[3:53:41.660 --> 3:53:46.500]  1970s and 1980s some of them are barely still operating with you know
[3:53:46.500 --> 3:53:52.820]  questionable functions and yet Russia's got the world's best anti-air defense I
[3:53:52.820 --> 3:53:59.220]  think it's the SA 500 can even take out low Earth orbit satellites can take out
[3:53:59.220 --> 3:54:03.860]  hypersonic missiles not that the US has even deployed any hypersonic missiles
[3:54:03.860 --> 3:54:08.820]  but Russia's got those too and then finally Russia's what is it the Sarmat
[3:54:08.820 --> 3:54:15.860]  missile the IC has I think 10 tree vehicles the MERS and can also be a
[3:54:15.860 --> 3:54:21.140]  fix with hyper glide vehicles or you know hypersonic glide vehicles HGVs
[3:54:21.140 --> 3:54:26.260]  there and there's no defense in the West against that there's London doesn't
[3:54:26.260 --> 3:54:30.660]  have a defense Paris doesn't have a defense Berlin Washington DC doesn't
[3:54:30.660 --> 3:54:35.420]  have a defense why are we trying to escalate into a world war when Russia
[3:54:35.420 --> 3:54:39.940]  can you could say you know nuke the crap out of the entire all the countries of
[3:54:39.940 --> 3:54:43.620]  Western civilization why are we provoking that our is our leaders just
[3:54:43.620 --> 3:54:48.820]  insane or the criminal go ahead it's the globalist desire for the extinction of
[3:54:48.820 --> 3:54:53.500]  human race remember we all quote we've seen the Georgia guide stones we've all
[3:54:53.500 --> 3:54:58.500]  quoted on talk radio for so many years actually decades but the bottom line is
[3:54:58.500 --> 3:55:04.100]  might they want a global nuclear war to decrease the world's population bring it
[3:55:04.100 --> 3:55:08.820]  down to 500 million well whenever the Georgia guide stones came out people said
[3:55:08.820 --> 3:55:13.180]  maintain you know they were reading maintain the population 500 million but
[3:55:13.180 --> 3:55:18.420]  they never asked how you get rid of the 7.4 billion people those are not quote
[3:55:18.420 --> 3:55:23.500]  the ravings of our ilt those are the absolute facts and when you're dealing
[3:55:23.500 --> 3:55:28.540]  about the Poseidon nuclear torpedoes that are 100 megatons you're talking
[3:55:28.540 --> 3:55:33.700]  about the hypersonic missiles that are 25 megatons we the how do I say this
[3:55:33.700 --> 3:55:38.700]  the denial in the defense part by the way the previous administration prior to
[3:55:38.700 --> 3:55:42.980]  Trump did everything they could to destroy the modernization of our nuclear
[3:55:42.980 --> 3:55:47.060]  arms look I'm just saying this ladies and gentlemen if you're gonna throw the
[3:55:47.060 --> 3:55:51.060]  first punch you better make sure you've got it in the right area and not forced
[3:55:51.060 --> 3:55:55.660]  behind it because one of these days very soon this is bigger than just Russian
[3:55:55.660 --> 3:56:01.020]  Ukraine in my opinion it's just mention a key phrase you said if you throw the
[3:56:01.020 --> 3:56:04.780]  first punch you know you better make sure it counts but if you look at classic
[3:56:04.780 --> 3:56:09.380]  game theory and mutually assured destruction theory and so on it seems
[3:56:09.380 --> 3:56:13.020]  like the West is putting Russia in a situation where Russia is incentivized
[3:56:13.020 --> 3:56:17.420]  to throw the first punch to to actually launch a preemptive strike because
[3:56:17.420 --> 3:56:22.420]  Russia has the better offensive missiles and they have better defensive
[3:56:22.420 --> 3:56:28.820]  anti-ICBA this is allowing them to absorb a retaliatory strike so in classic
[3:56:28.820 --> 3:56:33.220]  game theory America is making a horrendous mistake that could escalate
[3:56:33.220 --> 3:56:36.580]  this dramatically with catastrophic effects final thoughts Steve quail
[3:56:36.580 --> 3:56:41.860]  final thoughts America has no civil defense Russia can pretty much consider
[3:56:41.860 --> 3:56:48.140]  cover and put into their civil defense the fallout shelters etc 80% of
[3:56:48.140 --> 3:56:53.340]  population Vladimir Putin has stated if anything has taught history of war has
[3:56:53.340 --> 3:56:58.340]  taught him anything they who fire first usually win it used to be mutual
[3:56:58.340 --> 3:57:02.220]  assured destruction mad theory that no one would use nuclear weapons when you
[3:57:02.220 --> 3:57:06.220]  can shield your population you have very little to hold you back from taking
[3:57:06.220 --> 3:57:11.180]  out your enemies well thank you Steve for all of your thoughts and warnings

[3:58:55.260 --> 3:59:01.980]  die no that invariably follows but first there is the crackdown on populations
[3:59:01.980 --> 3:59:08.380]  basic liberty and speech and master censorship and now across the world from
[3:59:08.380 --> 3:59:14.860]  the United States to Europe legislation is being introduced that if you amplify

[3:59:22.540 --> 3:59:27.180]  can be a prison and of course now Canada's introduced legislation that if you
[3:59:27.180 --> 3:59:32.940]  have a fought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate

[3:59:37.580 --> 3:59:41.740]  authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world against
