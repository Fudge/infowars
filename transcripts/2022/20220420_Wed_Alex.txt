[00:00.000 --> 00:09.800]  It's Wednesday, April 20th, 2022, this broadcast will have some of the most powerful information
[00:09.800 --> 00:10.800]  ever covered.
[00:10.800 --> 00:22.120]  We'll be breaking next segment, but first, know that, know your enemy.
[00:22.120 --> 00:28.000]  Johnny Vedmore recently published an article exposing the hidden history of the mysterious
[00:28.000 --> 00:36.880]  world economic forum, who is currently waging war against the world with their great reset.
[00:36.880 --> 00:42.800]  Founder and director Klaus Schwab's three mentors were the most influential people in
[00:42.800 --> 00:49.920]  America's thermonuclear deterrence program, as well as leading proponents of a one-world
[00:49.920 --> 00:51.400]  government.
[00:51.400 --> 00:56.640]  Henry Kissinger recruited Klaus Schwab at the Harvard International Seminar, which was
[00:56.640 --> 00:58.880]  funded by the CIA.
[00:58.880 --> 01:04.400]  During this time, Kissinger was focused on global governance and depopulation.
[01:04.400 --> 01:10.080]  But it was with the Council on Foreign Relations that Kissinger became a major player by war
[01:10.080 --> 01:16.900]  gaming psychological operations involving America's growing thermonuclear weapons arsenal
[01:16.900 --> 01:21.600]  and writing the book on nuclear weapons and foreign policy.
[01:21.600 --> 01:27.760]  John K. Galbraith was a highly influential economist who helped Klaus Schwab create the
[01:27.760 --> 01:30.000]  world economic forum.
[01:30.000 --> 01:36.160]  Galbraith was an economist at Harvard who traveled to Germany in 1938 to study land
[01:36.160 --> 01:40.720]  policies under Hitler's National Socialist government.
[01:40.720 --> 01:46.420]  From there, he went to work on an advisory committee for FDR's New Deal.
[01:46.420 --> 01:51.120]  After World War II ended, his work shifted into nuclear weapons.
[01:51.120 --> 01:57.460]  Galbraith was tasked with evaluating the overall economic effects of the wartime bombing.
[01:57.460 --> 02:04.320]  He interrogated Nazi war criminal Albert Speer and was sent to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to
[02:04.320 --> 02:09.200]  evaluate the damage caused by the nuclear weapons attack.
[02:09.200 --> 02:15.440]  By 1968, Galbraith had joined Kissinger in his pursuit of a one-world government.
[02:15.440 --> 02:20.640]  And it was during this time that Kissinger introduced Galbraith to Klaus Schwab, along
[02:20.640 --> 02:28.760]  with Herman Kahn, who in 1967 suggested subverting democracy by training a select group of global
[02:28.760 --> 02:35.120]  leaders, which later became the world economic forum's young global leaders.
[02:35.120 --> 02:40.640]  Both Kissinger and Galbraith were heavily involved in the religion of thermonuclear deterrent
[02:40.640 --> 02:42.320]  warfare.
[02:42.320 --> 02:49.000]  But Herman Kahn was, as the New Yorker puts it, the heavyweight of the megadeth intellectuals.
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.040]  It is commonly referred to as the real Dr. Strangelove.
[02:54.040 --> 02:59.480]  Kahn wrote the official military policy on nuclear deterrence and believed that if everyone
[02:59.480 --> 03:04.000]  had nuclear weapons, the world would know peace.
[03:04.000 --> 03:11.360]  By the late 60s, Kahn was pushing for a European Union and joined Galbraith in 1970 on a European
[03:11.360 --> 03:18.920]  speaking tour to support Klaus Schwab's recruitment drive for the first European management symposium.
[03:18.920 --> 03:22.440]  Now known as the World Economic Forum.
[03:22.440 --> 03:27.680]  And while they were doing that, Klaus Schwab helped merge his father's nuclear weapons
[03:27.680 --> 03:33.280]  company into a company that he then directed to illegally build nuclear weapons for the
[03:33.280 --> 03:36.000]  South African government.
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.800]  In 1972, the Club of Rome published The Limits to Growth, which planted the seeds of the
[03:41.800 --> 03:44.120]  depopulation agenda.
[03:44.120 --> 03:49.920]  And while Kahn, Kissinger, and Galbraith helped Schwab get started, what really brought him
[03:49.920 --> 03:57.160]  the international support he was hoping for was when he introduced the ideas of depopulation.
[03:57.160 --> 04:05.680]  In 1972, the Club of Rome's founder was invited by Schwab to make the keynote speech in 1973.
[04:05.680 --> 04:10.080]  As controversial as it was, even Herman Kahn opposed it.
[04:10.080 --> 04:15.520]  The World Economic Forum suddenly caught the attention and financial support of powerful
[04:15.520 --> 04:21.360]  elitists everywhere and blew up to what it has become today.
[04:21.360 --> 04:27.520]  The article suggests that Schwab's supervillain persona is a deliberate marketing tactic to
[04:27.520 --> 04:33.960]  gain the attention from those who seek power and wealth to join Klaus Schwab as stakeholders
[04:33.960 --> 04:35.960]  in society.
[04:35.960 --> 04:41.840]  The author believes that the World Economic Forum is reaching its maximum level of expansion
[04:41.840 --> 04:47.600]  before its inevitable collapse, because eventually people will fight back.
[04:47.600 --> 04:54.280]  But they already know that, and all they really seem to care about is world government, depopulation,
[04:54.280 --> 04:57.920]  and thermonuclear war.
[04:57.920 --> 05:10.120]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[05:10.120 --> 05:20.080]  Over the years, InfoWars has produced more than 200 amazing, patriot Americana, Second
[05:20.080 --> 05:26.580]  Bank, celebrity works at Colombo dollars, from Bob
[05:26.580 --> 05:29.060]  Rees to Julian Kajetah from Adelaide.
[05:29.060 --> 05:32.160] kungo on social media.
[05:32.160 --> 05:37.700]  In fact, it's going to bring us personal экран contrasts and
[05:37.700 --> 05:37.920]  its participants delicate, ethical and
[05:37.940 --> 05:39.240] umbs up.
[05:39.240 --> 05:43.320]  We've got short sleeves, we've got them all and we've got to liquidate them all and they're
[05:43.320 --> 05:48.280]  limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs again.
[05:48.280 --> 05:52.400]  We are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in
[05:52.400 --> 05:53.400]  the future.
[05:53.400 --> 05:58.040]  We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air plus it spreads the word infowarstore.com
[05:58.040 --> 06:11.040]  Take your historic apparel now infowarstore.com
[06:11.040 --> 06:21.040]  Live from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:21.040 --> 06:35.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Wednesday, April
[06:35.040 --> 06:38.760]  20th worldwide broadcast.
[06:38.760 --> 06:45.680]  Remember the most powerful corrupt forces on earth are working around the clock to try
[06:45.680 --> 06:51.040]  to suppress this broadcast and broadcast like it because if the world learns of the crimes
[06:51.040 --> 06:53.760]  these individuals are committing its game over.
[06:53.760 --> 06:57.520]  Now some stations don't care the first five minutes but a lot of our affiliates do and
[06:57.520 --> 07:02.800]  I'm going to be airing it again later in the next hour and it's posted to bandodvidiuminfowars.com
[07:02.800 --> 07:09.680]  but the five minute report by Greg Reese, the megadeth intellectuals of the Great Reset
[07:09.680 --> 07:13.160]  is incredibly important.
[07:13.160 --> 07:17.480]  Now I know it was founded by Bilderberg Group and I know the World Economic Forum is a front
[07:17.480 --> 07:23.640]  of that and I know Henry Kissinger and the Rockefeller Foundation set it up and I talk
[07:23.640 --> 07:29.520]  about that but I really forget to put out special reports showing it all so you realize
[07:29.520 --> 07:37.040]  that the plan is to set up world government to then depopulate you and I under State Department
[07:37.040 --> 07:45.440]  memorandum 200 from 1974 written by Henry Kissinger as U.S. Government Directive Policy
[07:45.440 --> 07:46.880]  of Richard Nixon.
[07:46.880 --> 07:58.880]  You go back to a document from 13 years before and that's State Department memorandum 7277
[07:58.880 --> 08:02.640]  and it's where they got the book idea for Hunger Games.
[08:02.640 --> 08:06.920]  You see almost everything you see is predictive programming for plans they've actually got
[08:06.920 --> 08:07.920]  set up.
[08:07.920 --> 08:15.080]  It describes a Hunger Game scenario getting chills right now.
[08:15.080 --> 08:20.480]  So that is such an important report I just went live at infowars.com and newswars.com
[08:20.480 --> 08:24.040]  and bandodvidiuminfowars.com and I'm going to have that report by Greg Reese posted under
[08:24.040 --> 08:27.160]  the live show feed today.
[08:27.160 --> 08:31.760]  We put the live show feed on screen for listeners.
[08:31.760 --> 08:37.920]  The Netflix implosion, stock down 30 plus percent, millions leaving the platform is
[08:37.920 --> 08:42.240]  another bellwether of the total collapse of the establishment.
[08:42.240 --> 08:46.800]  The collapse of Netflix signals the end of the New World Order thought police strangle
[08:46.800 --> 08:48.640]  hold on humanity.
[08:48.640 --> 08:50.400]  Watch live.
[08:50.400 --> 09:01.720]  Now on top of that all we have seismic developments in the whole COVID globalist, cashless society,
[09:01.720 --> 09:06.080]  social credit score, market the beast takeover plan.
[09:06.080 --> 09:12.040]  We knew this would happen and it's even in the spars war game set in the year 2020-2023
[09:12.040 --> 09:14.880]  the document that throws you off it's really a battle plan so they get caught with them
[09:14.880 --> 09:18.680]  they just say it's a drill but the exact same words, exact same names, exact same attack
[09:18.680 --> 09:22.280]  plans all just moved and scrambled.
[09:22.280 --> 09:26.320]  It's an attack profile, attack operation directive.
[09:26.320 --> 09:31.320]  War game set in the year 2025-2028.
[09:31.320 --> 09:39.760]  That really set in 2020-2023 they even describe how after they've hit us with a bio weapon
[09:39.760 --> 09:45.920]  and then injected us with a further bio weapon how they will then even have the government
[09:45.920 --> 09:50.720]  heads and company heads get in trouble and then that will further destroy confidence
[09:50.720 --> 09:53.960]  in the economy and bring down western civilization.
[09:53.960 --> 09:57.880]  So it's meant to all come out.
[09:57.880 --> 09:58.960]  Let that sink in.
[09:58.960 --> 10:03.800]  But in a controlled way they don't want people to understand it's the globalist now and understand
[10:03.800 --> 10:07.400]  their master plan then people won't fall for the civil war.
[10:07.400 --> 10:14.680]  But when folks find out they've been injected with basically prion meets HIV or vades vaccine
[10:14.680 --> 10:22.480]  induced autoimmune deficiency disorder it's going to be explosive.
[10:22.480 --> 10:26.360]  And so this is real psycho stuff here.
[10:26.360 --> 10:30.440]  This is real James Bond villain stuff but the real world.
[10:30.440 --> 10:38.040]  Real ball headed Germans petting cats wearing weird space suit overalls okay.
[10:38.040 --> 10:45.720]  They're not playing games and when people figure out that we have a good chance of beating
[10:45.720 --> 10:50.640]  this and I keep harping on that so we've got that and we've got the economy and the war
[10:50.640 --> 10:52.720]  and just everything is off the chart.
[10:52.720 --> 10:53.720]  We've got to hit all of this today.
[10:53.720 --> 10:57.760]  We did a pretty good job covering probably 70% of what was on the plate yesterday.
[10:57.760 --> 11:00.400]  I'm trying to get to 100% of what's on the plate today.
[11:00.400 --> 11:03.040]  So I wasn't going to have any guests on but something really big broke so I got a guest
[11:03.040 --> 11:04.560]  popping in bottom of the next hour.
[11:04.560 --> 11:10.360]  But other than that we're going to have open phones in the third hour some open phones in
[11:10.360 --> 11:17.480]  the second hour as well and so much more in the fourth hour.
[11:17.480 --> 11:25.440]  We've got well two huge COVID admissions that are just shocking that we already knew but
[11:25.440 --> 11:29.880]  just shocking and you understand the behavioral psychology behind this when they have the head
[11:29.880 --> 11:34.800]  of Health and Human Services simultaneously with the head of the British Health Ministry
[11:34.800 --> 11:40.120]  and the head of the German Health Ministry all come out the same week and say it's funny
[11:40.120 --> 11:49.840]  these vaccines kill black people at higher levels and we had Dr. Lee Marron on with the
[11:49.840 --> 11:55.720]  genetic testing you would think that blacks and whites are actually the furthest apart
[11:55.720 --> 11:59.320]  but white skin is an adaptation to low sunlight.
[11:59.320 --> 12:04.600]  In the genetic testing they've done it's admitted blacks and whites are more closely related
[12:04.600 --> 12:11.840]  than blacks and whites to Asians and the COVID system is designed to attack blacks first
[12:11.840 --> 12:18.040]  and then whites second and that's in the literature that is not debatable so that gives you an
[12:18.040 --> 12:24.520]  idea ladies and gentlemen of what's going on here and it's very very very very serious.
[12:24.520 --> 12:31.520]  Now getting chills is so incredible they have come out the head of Health and Human Services
[12:31.520 --> 12:35.200]  and admitted that the vaccines killing twice as many black people as anybody else and they
[12:35.200 --> 12:39.600]  just admit this stuff in your face and the SPARS documents said they would do that by
[12:39.600 --> 12:45.400]  year three which we're entering right now and then it gets worse.
[12:45.400 --> 12:50.000]  Project Veritas has done it again and of course they'll be censored and indicted and attacked
[12:50.000 --> 13:02.800]  and everything else for it but recording of AstraZeneca's CEO Pascal Sorot saying millions
[13:02.800 --> 13:08.040]  of immunocompromised people can't be vaxxed and he goes on to basically admit it will
[13:08.040 --> 13:17.600]  kill them but they went ahead with it but folks this is crapping on us and then this
[13:17.600 --> 13:23.000]  is rubbing it in and then the very same corporate media and the very same Democrat party system
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.800]  and the rest of them are battling around the clock to take us off air and silence us for
[13:27.800 --> 13:35.560]  questioning mass shootings when a lot of times it turns out they've been provocateur staged
[13:35.560 --> 13:39.160]  because they don't want anybody up here asking questions and pointing all this out while they
[13:39.160 --> 13:44.000]  point their fingers at us and say we're the bad guys but Marilyn Albright brags she killed
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.360]  500,000 children on purpose with sanctions on food and medicine to children in Iraq and
[13:49.360 --> 13:50.360]  then she'd do it again.
[13:50.360 --> 13:54.960]  Oh well she's a big old pumpkin headed ugly woman so it's alright it's like well I mean
[13:54.960 --> 13:59.160]  she's a pumpkin head demon woman whose dad rounded up Jews and sold them to the Nazis
[13:59.160 --> 14:01.160]  well my god she's good then.
[14:01.160 --> 14:08.840]  Like Tim Cook's gay he can run death camps in China I mean come on got a little turtleneck
[14:08.840 --> 14:13.080]  so that's where we are and it's just an incredible time to be alive but you know thanks to all
[14:13.080 --> 14:17.920]  of you despite everything they've done and these rigged systems and attacks we're still
[14:17.920 --> 14:22.800]  on air and I've got to tell you licorice coming through in the last 48 hours since we explained
[14:22.800 --> 14:27.880]  that we declared limited chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy because the other side's lying and
[14:27.880 --> 14:32.840]  saying I got 60 million I got 18 million I don't have $3 million and I need about three
[14:32.840 --> 14:37.200]  or four in our system to just pay for product in the future and operate and to payroll for
[14:37.200 --> 14:41.480]  an operation this big that's running on empty that's like you've got to go 50 miles and
[14:41.480 --> 14:45.920]  you've got 30 miles of gas I mean we are becoming insolvent right now and they're running headlines
[14:45.920 --> 14:51.720]  everywhere that I've got you know all this money so you don't think I need support and
[14:51.720 --> 14:56.280]  so they get a giant jury verdict when I'm already in default they claim so I don't even get
[14:56.280 --> 14:59.880]  a real jury trial the jury told is going to be told I'm guilty and then I have all this
[14:59.880 --> 15:04.520]  money so they get a giant judgment that I can't even get bond for and they told us they want
[15:04.520 --> 15:08.480]  to come in here and shut the lights off and shut this facility down of course we got backup
[15:08.480 --> 15:14.160]  plans a lot of things but it takes your support and it takes your will against their will

[19:04.680 --> 19:09.680]  from people say why is it from Chiapas Mexico the communists well that's where some of the
[19:09.680 --> 19:14.880]  best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil better
[19:14.880 --> 19:18.800]  than watermelon coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers that you know the media
[19:18.800 --> 19:22.200]  calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever the point is is that
[19:22.200 --> 19:25.640]  it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take
[19:25.640 --> 19:29.080]  over so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what 14
[19:29.080 --> 19:32.200]  years and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another
[19:32.200 --> 19:36.360]  name for about 50% more per pound and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're
[19:36.360 --> 19:40.760]  going to find anywhere it's wake up america patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally
[19:40.760 --> 19:51.920]  um in fact I'm gonna tell you a little story um anyway so it's infowarstore.com and that's
[19:51.920 --> 20:01.240]  how we fund this operation and if you don't fund us don't want to see that's fine leading
[20:01.240 --> 20:17.400]  a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[20:17.400 --> 20:46.960]  it's all about freedom folks
[20:46.960 --> 21:07.800]  you don't have that you don't have anything freedom freedom all right ladies and gentlemen
[21:07.800 --> 21:11.120]  I'm gonna hit some really hardcore news you know what I'm gonna do this next time this
[21:11.120 --> 21:16.920]  is a longer segment but this is the head of health and human services admitting the
[21:16.920 --> 21:22.080]  vaccine kills twice as many black people as it does other colors which is true we've got
[21:22.080 --> 21:31.920]  those numbers but 18 to 64 working age in europe and the us across the board it's a 40%
[21:31.920 --> 21:39.840]  increase in death on average and an 80 plus percent increase in death in black males and
[21:39.840 --> 21:48.440]  it's directly contributed to the shot I mean this is just absolutely over the top it's
[21:48.440 --> 21:53.160]  not a typo it's not a mistake what he said he just said it I'll play it next segment
[21:53.160 --> 22:02.720]  and then that ties in to the CEO of AstraZeneca the bill gates minion admitting that the vaccine
[22:02.720 --> 22:08.000]  hurts people and you shouldn't give it to auto compromise and then on the news they're
[22:08.000 --> 22:16.560]  saying auto compromise need more shots and then what does the shot do it gets rid of
[22:16.560 --> 22:21.800]  your immune system and all the studies turns your white blood cells off that's coming up
[22:21.800 --> 22:26.560]  but I'm gonna say something here before I hit all this news I want to thank the listeners
[22:26.560 --> 22:31.360]  because you give me faith and you give me hope and I never want to give up but when
[22:31.360 --> 22:36.520]  I'm getting sued and lied about and injunctions and shut down a deep platform to debanked
[22:36.520 --> 22:43.220]  and infiltrated even though I'm not giving up when we start losing right when we're
[22:43.220 --> 22:48.760]  winning the hearts and minds it makes me feel like I'm giving up does that make sense so
[22:48.760 --> 22:54.240]  the fact that in the last two days you have made donations them for store.com and you
[22:54.240 --> 22:58.280]  bought a lot of product and in four store.com and you spread the word our traffic's way
[22:58.280 --> 23:02.720]  up that lets me know I'm not alone in this I want to thank you now to get out of the
[23:02.720 --> 23:09.720]  hole we're in and to really be able to be on a strong footing for the next year we need
[23:09.720 --> 23:14.640]  to have 20 days like we've had the last two days because I don't explain something this
[23:14.640 --> 23:23.400]  is the decision point I'm at if I stop buying supplements and products and things into the
[23:23.400 --> 23:30.800]  future which is 20 plus weeks on average with supply chain breakdown I'll have plenty of
[23:30.800 --> 23:35.280]  money to operate eight months and then we don't have any product and we can get a few
[23:35.280 --> 23:42.000]  sponsors but that won't get us 30% of where we need to be so but if I don't spend the
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.760]  money I've got then I can't keep the crew employed I can't pay for the bandwidth the
[23:45.760 --> 23:51.080]  satellite uplinks the legal the warehouse crew we're all self-contained because no one
[23:51.080 --> 23:54.240]  will work with us because we're evil Americans we love freedoms to the whole corporate systems
[23:54.240 --> 23:58.320]  against us you're now all experiencing that as well we were just the first to be hit as
[23:58.320 --> 24:06.480]  the model of what the enemy feared and so I'm at that point where if we don't get several
[24:06.480 --> 24:12.320]  million dollars which sounds like a lot it's not money worth what it used to be and and
[24:12.320 --> 24:17.640]  again our bandwidth alone is millions of dollars in every quarter because we are serving millions
[24:17.640 --> 24:22.960]  and millions and millions of audio streams and five six seven million videos just on
[24:22.960 --> 24:28.320]  band-op video and then millions a day on my own platform it's over six million total people
[24:28.320 --> 24:34.000]  a day clicking on our video streams and people say we'll put out crappy versions or go audio
[24:34.000 --> 24:39.040]  only well that's the kind of stuff that'll happen and I just do not want to get there
[24:39.040 --> 24:45.560]  and start turning this place off here's an example we pay for a direct satellite uplink
[24:45.560 --> 24:49.520]  we also serve a lot of the radio and TV stations with these real-time internet feeds they're
[24:49.520 --> 24:53.280]  rolling like a half second behind and still though a lot of TV stations radio stations
[24:53.280 --> 24:59.680]  want the satellite uplink so they can get us off satellite and that cost us something
[24:59.680 --> 25:03.520]  like twenty five thousand dollars a month that's something we're looking but enough affiliates
[25:03.520 --> 25:07.360]  we've contacted them we'll switch over the other system and so we're going to be turning
[25:07.360 --> 25:13.960]  that off in a few months so we're cutting everything we can around here and when you
[25:13.960 --> 25:19.080]  hear this BS that we're rolling in dough and I've got sixty million dollars or eighteen
[25:19.080 --> 25:24.360]  million dollars or ten million dollars or five million dollars Lord strike me down on
[25:24.360 --> 25:28.700]  my children God's witness I don't have five million dollars in cash I don't have three
[25:28.700 --> 25:33.000]  million dollars in cash I don't have a bunch of special extra stuff I don't have secret
[25:33.000 --> 25:40.240]  investments I don't have any of that if I sold everything I have I could run this place
[25:40.240 --> 25:46.160]  for a couple months right now I sold every piece of furniture and painting and gun and
[25:46.160 --> 25:52.200]  heirloom and my cars which and the left celebrates oh look he doesn't have a bunch of money I
[25:52.200 --> 25:58.280]  came from access television I don't care about money I've always grown up in the middle class
[25:58.280 --> 26:04.520]  family my dad has an ancestral ranch I've got I've got a car that works and I've got
[26:04.520 --> 26:08.720]  health care and I don't care what I care about freedom and not being silenced that's what's
[26:08.720 --> 26:14.520]  being robbed that's what's getting to me is having them silence us so they can lie about
[26:14.520 --> 26:18.200]  us and lie about you and do whatever they want to our populist God fearing movement
[26:18.200 --> 26:23.640]  so thank you from the bottom of my heart for keeping us in the fight that's why you calling
[26:23.640 --> 26:28.200]  and thank me I just want to say stop it right now I want to thank you because damn it you
[26:28.200 --> 26:33.400]  need to figure out that you are just as important as I am or more important we're a focal point
[26:33.400 --> 26:37.040]  here but you are way more important because you are the mass of people and you're the
[26:37.040 --> 26:42.080]  folks of every race color and creed who love justice and freedom and are trying to be good
[26:42.080 --> 26:45.720]  and trying to stand up to evil and love your children and love your neighbors and I'm your
[26:45.720 --> 26:51.040]  brother and I want all of you to know that I'm your brother and I love you and I appreciate
[26:51.040 --> 26:55.760]  you we're going to make it out of this with God's help together but this show this broadcast

[27:00.680 --> 27:07.000]  stepped up to the plate again when the billionaires cower in fear and everybody that's even scared
[27:07.000 --> 27:10.320]  of the new world order won't step up because they're part of the system and they never

[27:14.960 --> 27:20.200]  prayer out there you put your word of mouth out there you have done it all and the only
[27:20.200 --> 27:25.800]  reason we got a fighting chance against this satanic pedophile vampire new world order
[27:25.800 --> 27:31.800]  is because of you and all that matters is we give them the hell of a fight we got and
[27:31.800 --> 27:35.520]  we don't back down and I'm I know they want to put me in prison and I know they got grand

[33:23.320 --> 33:35.520]  it's alex jones xavier becara is the head of health and human services he came out on
[33:35.520 --> 33:40.600]  television and said that the vaccines kill minorities twice the rate of white people
[33:40.600 --> 33:48.200]  it's actually blacks not quote minorities not the case with asians and then we cut this
[33:48.200 --> 33:52.440]  into some newscast and with dr. mccullough was talking about as well and then we'll get
[33:52.440 --> 33:56.960]  into the admission by the ceo of astrazeneca that the vaccine is hurting people but they
[33:56.960 --> 34:02.520]  covered that up as well talk about arrogance talk about rubbing our noses in it hiding
[34:02.520 --> 34:07.920]  it in plain view here it is the way we know that vaccines are killing people of color
[34:07.920 --> 34:14.520]  blacks latinos indigenous people at about two times the rate of white americans by the
[34:14.520 --> 34:20.600]  way we know that vaccines are killing people of color blacks latinos indigenous people
[34:20.600 --> 34:29.040]  at about two times the rate of white americans just days after getting their second covid
[34:29.040 --> 34:35.160]  19 vaccine two teenage boys died in their sleep medical experts have been investigating
[34:35.160 --> 34:40.440]  what happened and have now released their report an epidemiologist says it adds to
[34:40.440 --> 34:46.600]  a body of evidence that confirms phyzers vaccine can lead to death in children and tds miguel
[34:46.600 --> 34:54.280]  moreno reports to attend class in some parts of the country kids need to be vaccinated
[34:54.280 --> 34:59.800]  against covid 19 the federal government says they're safe but gives them warning labels
[34:59.800 --> 35:06.000]  of what could lead to death this myocarditis warning that is out on flies and moderna is
[35:06.000 --> 35:12.720]  very serious epidemiologist peter mccullough says this in light of a new report its authors
[35:12.720 --> 35:18.560]  investigated the cases of two teenage boys from different states both of them had received
[35:18.560 --> 35:24.800]  second doses of the phyzer vaccine only to die a few days later in their sleep mccullough
[35:24.800 --> 35:30.400]  says that in his view the study confirms that phyzers vaccines led to the deaths of the
[35:30.400 --> 35:37.120]  teenagers that's the conclusion now it's the conclusion of several reports in the peer
[35:37.120 --> 35:43.480]  review nurtures isn't the only one so it's clear that our fda winds on these vaccines
[35:43.480 --> 35:48.800]  are valid and justified in these reports indicate in some cases is fatal the report
[35:48.800 --> 35:53.280]  was published by the college of american pathologist which is considered the largest
[35:53.280 --> 35:59.360]  organization of board certified pathologist the centers for disease control and prevention
[35:59.360 --> 36:05.360]  known as the cdc lists the myocarditis warning on its website for both phyzer and moderna's
[36:05.360 --> 36:11.960]  vaccines but no mention that myocarditis could lead to death we contacted the cdc but we haven't
[36:11.960 --> 36:16.720]  heard back we know we had to do a couple of things first we had to change the paradigm
[36:16.720 --> 36:22.200]  where people had to come to us in order to get services we decided we have to go to you
[36:22.200 --> 36:26.200]  because too many folks aren't fully aware of the kind of services and programs that are
[36:26.200 --> 36:30.720]  available to them so we didn't want to wait we went to you and the other thing we realized
[36:30.720 --> 36:35.920]  is we had to collect better data so we would know where you are and who you are that need
[36:35.920 --> 36:41.320]  to help most and so we established a minority health social vulnerable it vulnerability
[36:41.320 --> 36:46.280]  right so oh they got a minority vulnerability group and they admit this thing is killing
[36:46.280 --> 36:52.600]  blacks at twice the rate of other groups unbelievable but we know that in the actual
[36:52.600 --> 36:57.960]  documents it's not like he just slipped up and said that he's hiding it in plain view
[36:57.960 --> 37:02.440]  to cover their ass later and say oh well we knew about what was happening now here is
[37:02.440 --> 37:09.560]  the CEO of AstraZeneca saying millions of immunocompromised people can't be vaxxed but
[37:09.560 --> 37:15.000]  that's who they're on the news saying needs it more than anybody and needs extra shots
[37:15.000 --> 37:21.200]  even though it's not a vaccine remember that it's a gene therapy banned before this happened
[37:21.200 --> 37:27.480]  that Trump got bamboozled and stampeded into signing on to and I'm not even defending what
[37:27.480 --> 37:34.480]  Trump did I'm just saying it it's insane so here is that incredible project Veritas
[37:34.480 --> 37:41.120]  report you have to know a number of people cannot be vaccinated on a company-wide zoom
[37:41.120 --> 37:47.040]  call on December 3rd 2020 AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot stated millions of people with
[37:47.040 --> 37:52.560]  immune deficiencies can't be vaccinated even back then he saw enormous potential in monoclonal
[37:52.560 --> 37:58.880]  antibody treatments like if you have an immune disease, lupus or some other immune condition
[37:58.880 --> 38:03.160]  you cannot read or multiple sclerosis you can't be vaccinated so there are millions
[38:03.160 --> 38:09.840]  of people in the world that will need a protection that cannot be coming from a vaccine so the
[38:09.840 --> 38:15.600]  long-acting antibody has enormous potential this long-acting antibody is quite unique
[38:15.600 --> 38:23.440]  because this is the only combination that potentially will last more than six months
[38:23.440 --> 38:29.320]  up to potentially 12 months and protect people for a long period of time monoclonal antibody
[38:29.320 --> 38:34.680]  treatments were known to be effective relatively early in the COVID-19 pandemic and some states
[38:34.680 --> 38:40.240]  in the US moved quickly to use it as a frontline defense however the federal government actively
[38:40.240 --> 38:45.400]  pushed against the use of those treatments in favor of the vaccine the Biden administration
[38:45.400 --> 38:52.440]  which revoked outright revoked authorization for two very popular monoclonal antibody
[38:52.440 --> 38:57.560]  treatments at the state of Florida really pioneered over the summer we have had people
[38:57.560 --> 39:04.560]  use it and we've had good results people have a right to access these treatments and to revoke
[39:04.560 --> 39:11.080]  it on this basis is just fundamentally wrong if the CEO of one of the world's largest pharmaceutical
[39:11.080 --> 39:18.240]  companies realized back in 2020 that antibody treatments are necessary for the immunocompromised
[39:18.240 --> 39:22.920]  why would governments around the world force vaccine mandates when millions of people aren't
[39:22.920 --> 39:48.320]  at risk if they got it but getting that shot really was an amazing feeling it it it hits
[39:48.320 --> 39:55.760]  you it hits you lying murdering criminal death cult erasing your immune system giving you
[39:55.760 --> 40:02.440]  permanent prion infection on record and we're just living in this and you ask why would
[40:02.440 --> 40:09.400]  they do it because they know the average person when confronted with a crime this big we'll
[40:09.400 --> 40:13.680]  just say it can't be true like you know the Catholic Church 100 years ago didn't have
[40:13.680 --> 40:18.520]  a big problem with pedophilia or any other big institution because when it happened
[40:18.520 --> 40:25.720]  people went to prison or got their ass kicked but people by the 60s and stuff didn't want
[40:25.720 --> 40:30.400]  to admit it was going on so once you covered up somebody else doing something bad you were
[40:30.400 --> 40:36.240]  now corrupted and now the pedophiles have basically taken over every major institution
[40:36.240 --> 40:40.320]  and they're using the same tactics in the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts and the public
[40:40.320 --> 40:46.720]  schools and all of it so that you've got literal pedophiles coming from Drag Queen Storytown
[40:46.720 --> 40:52.920]  and little kids bouncing on these men's erections through their pants and all the rest of it
[40:52.920 --> 40:57.120]  and then everybody just can't admit this abuse is happening so they go oh just go along
[40:57.120 --> 41:04.560]  with it and then they broke in your will and now they can do basically anything they want
[41:04.560 --> 41:08.920]  and I'm telling you folks I remember Ted Gunnerson who was high level FBI they wanted him to
[41:08.920 --> 41:13.760]  be the FBI director he was the head of the whole LA sector telling me they used pedophilia
[41:13.760 --> 41:18.560]  to control people like 25, 26, 27 years ago at dinner and I knew he was respected and he
[41:18.560 --> 41:22.440]  came off as true but I just couldn't believe it I remember General Parton telling me that
[41:22.440 --> 41:26.240]  the former head of the Air Force Weapons Development telling me that and I remember all these other
[41:26.240 --> 41:31.560]  old timers people asked how I know all this stuff I had really smart people top generals
[41:31.560 --> 41:41.520]  top FBI top CIA folks that told me all this stuff I mean I was told this before I ever
[41:41.520 --> 41:51.520]  got on air in 2000 in 1995 and I knew about it and I couldn't believe it and now we're
[41:51.520 --> 41:59.200]  all living this where there's open pedophilia on TV there's open we need dictatorships we
[41:59.200 --> 42:02.880]  need to get rid of free speech I showed those articles yesterday Washington Post New York
[42:02.880 --> 42:09.920]  Times financial Times Bloomberg dictatorships good freedoms bad I mean I've got articles
[42:09.920 --> 42:18.760]  today in the UK where the BBC is teaching five-year-olds how to have sex I mean it's
[42:18.760 --> 42:25.400]  just there's no end to this literal adults saying we're grooming your children we're
[42:25.400 --> 42:31.760]  gonna seduce them and we're now at the point of that but the good news is the world is
[42:31.760 --> 42:36.120]  rejecting the garbage and we'll cover the really positive news no we'll start the really
[42:36.120 --> 42:40.120]  positive news the next hour I'll start with the Netflix implosion and what that signifies
[42:40.120 --> 42:44.280]  them I want to hit the rest of cover news and the mass mandate and some huge developments
[42:44.280 --> 42:48.920]  there as well when we come back but man this is just this is just absolutely insane and
[42:48.920 --> 43:00.960]  boy general parton and Ted Gunnerson were dead on incredible men over the years info
[43:00.960 --> 43:08.680]  wars is produced more than 200 amazing patriot americana second amendment pro-liberty themed

[43:54.000 --> 44:01.960]  the word info wars.com here historic apparel now info wars.com if I had to describe with
[44:01.960 --> 44:11.440]  just one word the brainwashing the mind control the asleep prince that the general public
[44:11.440 --> 44:18.240]  is in the best word would actually be the people are lost just like you're lost to sleep
[44:18.240 --> 44:24.240]  or lost in a bad nightmare you're in a horror you get knocked out and you've lost your
[44:24.240 --> 44:31.600]  bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused you have a concussion and that's
[44:31.600 --> 44:36.600]  what the globalists have done they have stunned us they have put us into a position of not
[44:36.600 --> 44:40.320]  knowing our bearings and then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave him speech he called
[44:40.320 --> 44:44.880]  the great new narrative where he brags how the public is lost how the culture in the
[44:44.880 --> 44:50.240]  media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity
[44:50.240 --> 44:55.320]  over the edge of a cliff that's what the great reset is they need darkness to thrive the light
[44:55.320 --> 45:03.680]  lives at info wars.com the globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual
[45:03.680 --> 45:08.840]  warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're
[45:08.840 --> 45:13.280]  doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of God the creator and
[45:13.280 --> 45:20.120]  we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much so that's why I repeat that famous
[45:20.120 --> 45:27.360]  internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda
[45:27.360 --> 45:33.560]  would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless they need all their propaganda and
[45:33.560 --> 45:39.960]  all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we
[45:39.960 --> 45:45.040]  are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser and
[45:45.040 --> 45:48.880]  that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever
[45:48.880 --> 45:52.840]  because even if you don't believe in God what the globalists are manifesting and setting
[45:52.840 --> 45:57.600]  up is safe handling and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast
[45:57.600 --> 45:58.840]  they just announced.
[45:58.840 --> 46:03.440]  You know it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it it's just true that info wars
[46:03.440 --> 46:11.480]  is seen by the globalists as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist
[46:11.480 --> 46:19.200]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program and man our work is really right now
[46:19.200 --> 46:25.080]  hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done so I'm asking listeners now

[47:56.440 --> 48:02.520]  order thought police stranglehold on humanity that's coming up next hour with your phone
[48:02.520 --> 48:11.240]  calls my lovelies but let's go ahead and hit this stack right now I just blasted your
[48:11.240 --> 48:17.480]  segments played you to mega bombshells that'll just be forgotten by tomorrow even by myself
[48:17.480 --> 48:21.280]  because we're in the thick of the war not bitching you I mean how do we have our memories
[48:21.280 --> 48:25.640]  how do we point this out oh here's the head of the health and human services saying these
[48:25.640 --> 48:30.720]  so-called vaccines really hurt black people which are in the studies and they know but
[48:30.720 --> 48:37.760]  we need to get more blacks injected it's gaslighting hurts everybody the black folks particularly
[48:37.760 --> 48:43.200]  of course new order has a real hard on for black folks and that's why they gave them
[48:43.200 --> 48:47.880]  gangster culture and CIA crack and just to destroy the family and they're doing everybody
[48:47.880 --> 48:51.960]  else but it was all first tested on them so you look where black folks are at that's where
[48:51.960 --> 48:58.480]  everybody else is about to be or is already there statistically it's a nightmare situation
[48:58.480 --> 49:04.280]  but let's look at this little jewel that will hit after I go to the stack road island dim
[49:04.280 --> 49:13.080]  submit bill to double state income tax for parents of unvaccinated minors medical tyranny
[49:13.080 --> 49:19.640]  it's not even vaccine that's what they're trying all over the world that is a huge huge deal
[49:19.640 --> 49:28.080]  that's coming up but first let's go ahead and just plow through all of this information
[49:28.080 --> 49:32.600]  but let me say something about the career real quick you know I love the crew this is
[49:32.600 --> 49:35.720]  already in my stack today but they thought it was so important they brought to me again
[49:35.720 --> 49:40.720]  about road island and the bill but they didn't just give me the local article the Miami standard
[49:40.720 --> 49:50.560]  dot news they went and got the bill and then they had sections where it says that see we
[49:50.560 --> 49:55.840]  actually show you the bill unlike what corporate media does they'll tell you oh Alex Jones
[49:55.840 --> 50:01.840]  was a white supremacist where's the clip oh Alex Jones did this and that we're really
[50:01.840 --> 50:05.920]  where's the proof it's all a pack of lies and folks I know you know that but let me tell
[50:05.920 --> 50:12.280]  you being a public figure in the middle of this I've learned these people stack lies
[50:12.280 --> 50:16.720]  on top of lies where it just it's so complex you think well this has got to have some truth
[50:16.720 --> 50:24.320]  to it but it doesn't so you don't give your kid an experimental shot that's been killing
[50:24.320 --> 50:28.280]  people all over the world well you've got to pay double income tax which is a huge tax
[50:28.280 --> 50:35.080]  in Rhode Island let's continue feds will appeal mask ruling only if mandates still needed
[50:35.080 --> 50:41.280]  oh if the bureaucracy the CDC bought and paid for by big pharma says well then it's the
[50:41.280 --> 50:48.680]  science you got to do it all a giant fraud all a giant lie metro drops mass mandate
[50:48.680 --> 50:59.520]  after 700 days and unease follows oh my gosh what are we going to do mass mandate suddenly
[50:59.520 --> 51:05.720]  sparks confusion mixed messages the airports were all shut down yesterday with a bunch
[51:05.720 --> 51:10.320]  of flights delayed because people were like what they're not wearing their mask the government
[51:10.320 --> 51:21.040]  says I don't have to know team Biden waivers on fight over mask after court setback but
[51:21.040 --> 51:27.720]  they're promising to try to bring it back the summer of revenge travel is coming no one
[51:27.720 --> 51:32.280]  can afford it yeah the prices are just exploding thanks to inflation which they're blaming
[51:32.280 --> 51:37.600]  on Putin and it was Putin's fault I'd say screw you Putin but it's not it's the central
[51:37.600 --> 51:43.640]  banks issuing so much currency and devaluing things is it Putin's fault Zimbabwe had hyper
[51:43.640 --> 51:48.560]  inflation is it Putin's fault why more Germany had hyperinflation no it's the fault of the
[51:48.560 --> 51:54.080]  central banks and our fault for letting it happen man if only Putin was our problem that
[51:54.080 --> 51:59.840]  be easy to fix by administration set to appeal ruling that lifted mass mandate of course
[51:59.840 --> 52:08.040]  White House divided HHS secretary same one that says vaccines are killing people but
[52:08.040 --> 52:15.760]  it's okay splits from Biden says admin will likely appeal mass mandate and it goes on
[52:15.760 --> 52:21.240]  from there now this is really important I told you this two years ago on record probably
[52:21.240 --> 52:25.200]  a hundred times just I was trying to find this morning I couldn't but I saw the clip
[52:25.200 --> 52:30.640]  because I said it remember I said you'll go to the ball game you will try to make you
[52:30.640 --> 52:35.640]  wear a mask forever and they're going to say that viruses are like weather reports now
[52:35.640 --> 52:41.480]  so lockdowns will be rolling random controlled by AI just training you to live in a police
[52:41.480 --> 52:46.440]  state with all the little home assistants watching you and listening to you says it
[52:46.440 --> 52:53.960]  all right here official cdc.gov announcement yesterday April 19 2022 center for forecasting
[52:53.960 --> 53:02.240]  outbreak analysis analytics and it says that it'll be like weather reports but it'll decide
[53:02.240 --> 53:06.720]  whether you can leave your house or where you can go called a high tech martial law
[53:06.720 --> 53:11.560]  grid and why would anyone go along with this when it's going to destroy you and your family
[53:11.560 --> 53:18.760]  99.999% of people are going to be screwed by this show stop pretending as a leftist
[53:18.760 --> 53:23.680]  bureaucrat or as a teacher or a lawyer or whatever that you're part of the structure
[53:23.680 --> 53:27.960]  and going along with this is powerful and cool no you're a schmuck you're a useful
[53:27.960 --> 53:34.520]  idiot it's not cool again already covered this but here it is again Veritas strikes
[53:34.520 --> 53:39.920]  again AstraZeneca CEO admits you shouldn't give the vaccine that isn't a vaccine to auto
[53:39.920 --> 53:48.360]  immune compromise it can kill them but then publicly pushed it on unbelievable oh today
[53:48.360 --> 53:53.600]  we officially launched the CDC center for forecasting and outbreak analytics imagine
[53:53.600 --> 53:58.800]  having the models and forecast needed to look and to predict diseases outbreaks like we
[53:58.800 --> 54:05.640]  predict the weather the center is striving to do just that so if you like all the fake
[54:05.640 --> 54:10.040]  forecasting and fake lies of your five million dead americans and a million dead brits and
[54:10.040 --> 54:14.840]  all of it lies well don't worry now it'll all be computerized even fancier forced onto
[54:14.840 --> 54:19.720]  your phone or TV and here's the guy that's running the whole deal another little globalist

[1:00:07.880 --> 1:00:13.760]  johnny vedmore recently published an article exposing the hidden history of the mysterious
[1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:22.640]  world economic forum who is currently waging war against the world with their great reset
[1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:28.560]  founder and director claus Schwab's three mentors were the most influential people in
[1:00:28.560 --> 1:00:35.440]  america's thermonuclear deterrence program as well as leading proponents of a one world
[1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:41.640]  government henry kissinger reclaw Schwab at the harvard international seminar which was
[1:00:41.640 --> 1:00:48.640]  funded by the sea during this time kissinger was focused on global governance and depulation
[1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:54.520]  but it was with the council on foreign relations that kissinger became a major player by war
[1:00:54.520 --> 1:01:01.320]  gaming psychological operations involving america's growing thermonuclear weapons arsenal
[1:01:01.320 --> 1:01:08.360]  and writing the book on nuclear weapons and foreign policy john k galbraith was a highly
[1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:15.120]  influential economist who helped claus Schwab create the world economic forum galbraith
[1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:21.520]  was an economist at harvard who traveled to germany in 1938 to study land policies
[1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:27.320]  under hitler's national socialist government from there he went to work on an advisory
[1:01:27.320 --> 1:01:34.280]  committee for f dr's new deal after world war two ended his work shifted into nuclear
[1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:40.560]  weapons galbraith was tasked with evaluating the overall economic effects of the wartime
[1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:47.400]  bombing he interrogated nazi war criminal albert spear and was sent to herosima and
[1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:55.640]  nagasaki to evaluate the damage caused by the nuclear weapons attack by 1968 galbraith
[1:01:55.640 --> 1:02:01.040]  had joined kissinger in his pursuit of a one world government and it was during this time
[1:02:01.040 --> 1:02:09.440]  that kissinger introduced galbraith to claus Schwab along with herman con who in 1967 suggested
[1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:15.360]  subverting democracy by training a select group of global leaders which later became
[1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:21.920]  the world economic forums young global leaders both kissinger and galbraith were heavily
[1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:28.960]  involved in the religion of thermonuclear deterrent warfare but herman con was as the new yorker
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:36.280]  puts it the heavyweight of the megadeth intellectuals and is commonly referred to as the real dr
[1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:43.160]  strange love con wrote the official military policy on nuclear deterrence and believed
[1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:50.000]  that if everyone had nuclear weapons the world would know peace by the late sixties con was
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:57.400]  pushing for a european union and joined galbraith in 1970 on a european speaking tour to support
[1:02:57.400 --> 1:03:03.960]  claus Schwab's recruitment drive for the first european management symposium now known
[1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:10.240]  as the world economic forum and while they were doing that claus Schwab helped merge
[1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:15.680]  his father's nuclear weapons company into a company that he then directed to illegally
[1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:23.160]  build nuclear weapons for the south african government in 1972 the club of roam published
[1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:29.880]  the limits to growth which planted the seeds of the depopulation agenda and while con kissinger
[1:03:29.880 --> 1:03:35.600]  and galbraith helped Schwab get started what really brought him the international support
[1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:44.000]  he was hoping for was when he introduced the ideas of depopulation in 1972 the club of roams
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:52.320]  founder was invited by Schwab to make the keynote speech in 1973 as controversial as it was
[1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:58.080]  even herman con opposed it the world economic forum suddenly caught the attention and financial
[1:03:58.080 --> 1:04:06.080]  support of powerful elitists everywhere and blew up to what it has become today the article
[1:04:06.080 --> 1:04:12.120]  suggests that Schwab's super villain persona is a deliberate marketing tactic to gain
[1:04:12.120 --> 1:04:18.280]  the attention from those who seek power and wealth to join claus Schwab as stakeholders
[1:04:18.280 --> 1:04:24.840]  in society the author believes that the world economic forum is reaching its maximum level
[1:04:24.840 --> 1:04:31.720]  of expansion before its inevitable collapse because eventually people will fight back
[1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:38.440]  but they already know that and all they really seem to care about is world government depopulation
[1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:50.160]  and thermonuclear war reporting for info wars this is greg rees and it's reports like that

[1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:35.680]  will to go along with it that's why they don't want you to know so you can make the choice
[1:07:35.680 --> 1:07:41.360]  they want to kind of drug you up and hypnotize you and spin you around and before you know
[1:07:41.360 --> 1:07:46.240]  it you think you made a decision to be successful and you've really made a decision to serve
[1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:53.560]  death but you do not see a better example of this with all the major globalist institutions
[1:07:53.560 --> 1:08:00.600]  falling apart right in front of us than netflix yes cnn spent three hundred four hundred
[1:08:00.600 --> 1:08:07.160]  million dollars plus and they couldn't get ten thousand viewers a day with their cnn plus
[1:08:07.160 --> 1:08:16.400]  more vomit cnn plus more communist in his network that's a echo of itself it's the same thing
[1:08:16.400 --> 1:08:22.280]  over and over again and and and every other new world order city and every other new world
[1:08:22.280 --> 1:08:31.600]  order company are all based on parasitic activities and based on lies so you've got obama on the
[1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:37.040]  board of netflix and obama with his hundred million dollar ear contract or whatever it was i saw a few
[1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:46.480]  years ago spewing the most vile snake venom against humanity the most horrible pedophilic
[1:08:46.480 --> 1:08:57.760]  anti-family trash and then you wonder why people get sick of it and literally vomit it up out of
[1:08:57.760 --> 1:09:07.440]  their mouth he's expecting in shows like that and cuties and all the rest those shows you know i
[1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:15.520]  told you one of my friends that i work with i couldn't go to uh the big film festival a few
[1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:22.320]  years ago but he was gonna go and and they let him into some of the big backroom meetings and they
[1:09:22.320 --> 1:09:26.800]  were just openly saying we're been told to demoralize make everybody depressed and just
[1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:33.680]  destroy everything they'll give us unlimited money just do that and everything is to confuse you so
[1:09:33.680 --> 1:09:40.880]  you accept ugliness is beauty so that you will bow down while they destroy you and imagine our
[1:09:40.880 --> 1:09:48.400]  poor children but the good news is everyone is rejecting this because this isn't a sign of strength
[1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:57.040]  by these merchants of psychic anesthetic and genetic death it is a sign of their perpetual
[1:09:57.040 --> 1:10:02.800]  weakness and the fact that they're just a virus a program being run against us to take us down
[1:10:04.240 --> 1:10:13.120]  so a shocked wall street rejects the netflix new world order a shocked wall street reacts to netflix's
[1:10:13.120 --> 1:10:19.600]  implosion and you can see they're down 35 percent and let's check the latest numbers right now
[1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:27.760]  netflix stock plunges 37 percent on shock subscriber loss hundreds of thousands leaving a month
[1:10:27.760 --> 1:10:34.720]  millions total freefall collapse the shows are horrible they're not well produced they're riddled
[1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:41.360]  with just bizarre propaganda i mean here's an example i love black folks i love everybody
[1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:48.640]  i'm not going to watch a show about shaka zulu and expect shaka zulu the famous zulu warrior to be
[1:10:48.640 --> 1:10:54.160]  white you try to watch the historic viking shows they advertise historic and like the top generals
[1:10:54.160 --> 1:11:00.400]  and queens are black it's just not true and again you you look at this people don't want to watch
[1:11:00.400 --> 1:11:09.760]  this they don't want to watch bs dow Jones futures rise after market rally but netflix crashes
[1:11:09.760 --> 1:11:18.560]  is as subscribers fall coming thursday april 21st he's expecting i mean just
[1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:27.600]  a story of two men having a baby and it's two biological women that have grown beards
[1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:37.360]  and it goes on from there in fact where's netflix right now last time i checked it was down 37
[1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:41.680]  percent and still dropping but let's look at this one
[1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:47.840]  yeah so it's uh down
[1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:58.960]  down a lot ladies and gentlemen 30 yeah 30 34.73 percent right now but look at this
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:07.600]  axios scoop oh my gosh it's a scoop we told you about this weeks ago but it's a scoop by axios
[1:12:07.600 --> 1:12:14.800]  oh my gosh people are rejecting lies and tyranny what a scoop scoop
[1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:26.560]  waters wet cnn plus looks doomed oh what a what a scoop 300 million cash investment 100 million
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:35.040]  an infrastructure investment 400 million dollars plus and no one is watching
[1:12:37.200 --> 1:12:46.640]  it is a flatline well again that is these shelf appointed crazy people that all get
[1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:50.160]  together and said they're gonna censor they're gonna control they're gonna dominate everybody
[1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:55.200]  wants to hear what they have to say and the answer is no we don't want to hear what you have to say
[1:12:55.200 --> 1:13:04.800]  so the collapse of netflix is just another bellwether that on every front people are rejecting
[1:13:06.400 --> 1:13:10.880]  the left fetish of running everybody else down and trying to control our lives
[1:13:14.400 --> 1:13:22.960]  bbc cancels nude sex education theater showing targeted children at their death threats promoted
[1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:31.680]  pleasure quareness and gender to little children as young as five men and and always bizarre weird

[1:14:06.240 --> 1:14:12.480]  that no one ever stood up to you know i'm gonna go on blare white's podcast and uh
[1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:17.920]  uh blare white's a conservative transgender person and i see the conservatives get mad and
[1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:22.320]  the liberals liberals go oh you're a hypocrite you hate anybody that's different and the right
[1:14:22.320 --> 1:14:26.400]  wingers go oh look you're going to hell well jesus hung out with the prostitutes and debtors
[1:14:26.400 --> 1:14:30.160]  the rest of people and i'll get the speck out of my eye and you get the beam out of yours but
[1:14:30.160 --> 1:14:36.000]  i don't hate blare white it's a very nice person very well spoken and and and and made the decision
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:43.120]  as an adult didn't do it as a child is it targeting children and it said for five years on my show
[1:14:44.720 --> 1:14:50.720]  where blare white first came on that it's bad what's happening and we should not let people
[1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:55.680]  target children i don't hate people for decisions they've made in their life or things they've done
[1:14:55.680 --> 1:15:00.480]  or how they feel and there are a lot of people that feel feminine and with the chemicals you know
[1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:05.840]  people feel like look like the super right wing christians will tell you oh it's never natural people
[1:15:05.840 --> 1:15:10.560]  aren't born like this uh really is that why most of the frogs are born wanting to have sex with
[1:15:10.560 --> 1:15:20.000]  male frogs it's the chemicals in utero don't flip the sex but confuse it in everything you you give
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:26.720]  a male embryo these chemicals and it's gonna cause brain development where a female smells
[1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:31.280]  a certain thing she's attracted a male smells a certain smell they're attracted it even affects
[1:15:31.280 --> 1:15:38.560]  olfactory these people are hematroditic folks they are women and no one's saying then hate people
[1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:43.360]  that are a woman because chemically their brain got changed we're saying don't mess with children
[1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:47.440]  and don't attack them then that's the real scientific issue and that's why they ridicule me
[1:15:47.440 --> 1:15:52.000]  and attack me because they don't want you knowing what they did to the water folks you understand
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:16:00.320]  i mean penis sizes are down like back 90% from the chemicals it was about 25 years ago that i wanted
[1:16:00.320 --> 1:16:04.480]  to expand in for worse i've been on the air a couple of years but i only had money to finance

[1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:06.000]  and billions of dollars a year are invested it was the obon guard new hollywood launch
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:14.320]  left us takeover pure anti-family anti-human anti-american poison and horrible acting horrible

[1:21:41.280 --> 1:21:44.480]  of these headlines i'm going to pull my hair out well luckily most of it's falling out so it's not
[1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:49.040]  a problem because i see these damn headlines excuse me lord i see these headlines hundreds of
[1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:55.040]  times a day without looking oh biden's a buffoon he's a moron he doesn't know what he's doing
[1:21:55.040 --> 1:22:02.160]  says senator ran paul says senator cotton says senator holly says senator cruz says
[1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:14.000]  cudlow larry cudlow and they just go what's wrong with these morons if we cut off all the cold power
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:19.920]  plants that are totally clean we'll go bankrupt because china isn't cutting any duh if we cut
[1:22:19.920 --> 1:22:27.280]  off the pipeline we'll go bankrupt why doesn't he know that hurts america he doesn't know so no one
[1:22:27.280 --> 1:22:32.560]  ever says it's on purpose when it's in the club of rome in the world economic forum documents in
[1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:37.920]  their damn public statements you can have a cold power plant we will bankrupt you barack obama
[1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:46.720]  2008 i mean these are real quotes you won't be all the car recognition soon you'll all

[1:22:53.440 --> 1:23:00.800]  going on so i see these type of headlines biden economy he doesn't seem to care one width
[1:23:00.800 --> 1:23:06.320]  about economic growth and prosperity it's always the g they didn't know it's like somebody grabs
[1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:10.640]  a kid out of the backyard goes and tortures them to death like oh they didn't know that
[1:23:10.640 --> 1:23:14.800]  hooking them up without electrical wiring would kill them they didn't know chopping their head
[1:23:14.800 --> 1:23:19.920]  off might kill them and again it's always this all the liberals are idiots is that why they're
[1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:23.360]  running circles around us is that why they're bankrupting the economy is that why the damn
[1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:26.720]  border is wide open is that why they're human smuggling is that why they're launching all
[1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:32.000]  these wars no they got their freaking act together screwing us on design damn it
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:37.920]  and i'm gonna tell you this is one of the biggest problems we face is a we don't admit
[1:23:37.920 --> 1:23:45.440]  this is a spiritual battle and then b we sit here and go oh the liberals are idiots or
[1:23:45.440 --> 1:23:51.440]  they don't care no they care a lot they even have a plan called ploward and piven to bankrupt the
[1:23:51.440 --> 1:23:54.880]  government by overflowing with welfare to get rid of the capitalist system
[1:23:57.920 --> 1:24:01.120]  and it's the ultra rich that are doing that because they want to get rid of their competition so
[1:24:01.120 --> 1:24:05.760]  Larry Kudlow man you're a good guy you did some good policies with Trump
[1:24:05.760 --> 1:24:10.720]  geez i like you but will you please pull your head out of the sand and will you please stop
[1:24:10.720 --> 1:24:17.120]  lying to viewers on fox and telling people on your daily show that the democrats don't know
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:21.440]  what they're doing they're following a globalist plan that is exact on record
[1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:28.320]  and oh no let me go somewhere else i've seen in my stacks today
[1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:34.720]  today no fewer than over 10 articles about how the russians have infiltrated the media
[1:24:34.720 --> 1:24:38.720]  and the russians have infiltrated the right wing the same old crap again when the russians
[1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:43.440]  are not bad people but when it comes to infiltrating stuff and it comes to influence they can't
[1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:49.520]  tie their shoelaces compared to the globalist and the chinese the globalists are the masters
[1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:54.640]  the chinese are close second the russians are the most ham-fisted infiltrators on earth you
[1:24:54.640 --> 1:25:00.560]  want stock and bond or you want beautiful woman or you want both that is what it consists of
[1:25:00.560 --> 1:25:07.360]  with the russian intelligence operation putin like you you like girl no you like you like boy
[1:25:07.360 --> 1:25:13.120]  you like money that's how it goes you like girl you like boy you like money
[1:25:17.040 --> 1:25:21.840]  the russians are like hillbillies not knocking hillbillies i'm a hillbilly too the point is
[1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:27.440]  they're literally like 1950s hillbillies or something okay show show the the
[1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:36.560]  you know who infiltrated us is the world economic forum you know who penetrated the
[1:25:36.560 --> 1:25:41.680]  governments and is now in full control you read what the debots group wants we're living in they
[1:25:41.680 --> 1:25:52.960]  are in control of our lives down to what goes in our bodies and where we can travel and what we
[1:25:52.960 --> 1:25:59.200]  got to wear on our face and tracking us i mean that is their world and they are not in this for
[1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:05.280]  your good they're in this to hurt you and they run the corporate race pating and division while
[1:26:05.280 --> 1:26:09.600]  they screw everybody over while they starve with her world of death i mean they are a sick group
[1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:16.400]  of murdering filth with a decaying puppet up there to degrade america so they can blame him
[1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:21.440]  for what they're doing so when you talk about oh biden doesn't he's an idiot when he cuts off our
[1:26:21.440 --> 1:26:31.600]  energy he has a moronic policy no he's at war with america they're shutting the country down
[1:26:31.600 --> 1:26:38.400]  we're up against a corporate global government takeover that seeks to implode civilization and
[1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:45.280]  consolidate power and control for depopulation and it goes back to state department random 200
[1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:50.560]  and the bilgerberg group and the club of rome and their stated goals and the georgia guide stones
[1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:58.960]  and all the bill gates quotes and his father's quotes and their whole plan and we sit here eating
[1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:04.080]  around the edges while they have every major newspaper in the western world that i've seen
[1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:09.520]  say dictatorship is good getting rid of free speech is good getting rid of borders is good
[1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:14.880]  getting rid of the family is good pedophilia is good and i'm like no it's not it's bad
[1:27:16.480 --> 1:27:20.880]  and so if we'll simply wake up to the new world order and the fact that they're out to get us
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:24.960]  and the rest of it it's game over we're gonna go to break you know that the globalists are
[1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:28.880]  trying to shut us down right now and we don't get extra support they will be successful at
[1:27:28.880 --> 1:27:33.360]  imploding in full wars i'll still be here you know in certain ways but it'll be like so wrong
[1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:40.000]  without the ring not at full power so the point is is that we will rock reconstitute them okay

[1:34:05.960 --> 1:34:07.520]  going into Saturday morning.
[1:34:07.520 --> 1:34:16.480]  The save info wars money bomb info wars 2022.com info wars 2022.com is the name info wars and
[1:34:16.480 --> 1:34:23.640]  then 2022.com and it's going to be a very, very special basically commercial free.
[1:34:23.640 --> 1:34:29.720]  Well, we'll have a few breaks played reports and videos and exclusive stuff, but we need
[1:34:29.720 --> 1:34:31.800]  to raise a couple million dollars.
[1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:37.560]  You see big corporate media seeing in plus with 300 plus million dollars and they can't
[1:34:37.560 --> 1:34:39.400]  get 10,000 viewers a day.
[1:34:39.400 --> 1:34:43.880]  We have millions and millions a day conservatively just on Bandai video millions a day on the
[1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:50.000]  audio and video streams and millions visiting info wars.com and news wars.com and then millions
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:53.280]  of people copying the videos and sharing and there's just no way to even keep track of
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:54.280]  it.
[1:34:54.280 --> 1:34:59.080]  So we have overridden the sensors and they're really pissed off and so they are coming down
[1:34:59.080 --> 1:35:00.960]  on us trying to shut us down.
[1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:01.960]  We're not going anywhere.
[1:35:01.960 --> 1:35:02.960]  We get the finances.
[1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:07.640]  I've not declared bankruptcy myself, but we've done it with some of the companies so
[1:35:07.640 --> 1:35:13.840]  that we can let a federal trustee in and then show them everything and all the other information
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:17.400]  so they know what the media and the other courts is doing is not true because those
[1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:18.400]  other courts have the data.
[1:35:18.400 --> 1:35:21.000]  They go, Jones has $65 million in the bank.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:23.520]  I don't have $3 million in the bank.
[1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:27.800]  Jones secretly did this and that did no such thing and they know all this because the
[1:35:27.800 --> 1:35:32.400]  court ordered the most insane discovery ever in Connecticut and Texas.
[1:35:32.400 --> 1:35:33.400]  We complied.
[1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:40.040]  And then they defaulted and said we gave them faulty financials, which is criminal charge.
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:45.280]  Big CPAs, CPA we use as a big Democrat does it for big Democrat law firms.
[1:35:45.280 --> 1:35:48.680]  I was like, give us a third party in here a few years ago, bring in a top CPA that they'll
[1:35:48.680 --> 1:35:49.680]  believe.
[1:35:49.680 --> 1:35:50.680]  Oh, they say he's a fraud.
[1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:51.680]  And I go to our guest.
[1:35:51.680 --> 1:35:53.800]  I just want to point this out.
[1:35:53.800 --> 1:36:00.280]  They know that over the last three years, the $60 plus million was paid into a company
[1:36:00.280 --> 1:36:04.520]  we set up for liability protections, how you do it, to have the supplements held there.
[1:36:04.520 --> 1:36:07.000]  So you pay that company over my dad.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:12.320]  It then buys the supplements and then we buy them back and then pay for new supplements.
[1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:15.920]  So that's the cost of it over three years is $60 something million dollars.
[1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:22.800]  Imagine they go, oh, he secretly put $60 million into shell corporations.
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:28.520]  The hell I did is God is my witness and they're going to find out when the federal magistrate
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:32.960]  sees all that, I'm not going to sit there and take this crap anymore.
[1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:36.080]  It's disgusting and they know exactly what they're doing.
[1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:37.080]  Sorry.
[1:36:37.080 --> 1:36:38.080]  I'm ranting.
[1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:39.580]  It just drives me crazy.
[1:36:39.580 --> 1:36:40.580]  They censor us.
[1:36:40.580 --> 1:36:41.800]  They take our sponsors over the years.
[1:36:41.800 --> 1:36:46.360]  We saw our own products and then they try to shut that down and then we buy the products.
[1:36:46.360 --> 1:36:51.320]  They say that we're covering up money when they know damn well that was paid in to buy
[1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:52.320]  the products.
[1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:53.320]  Excuse me.
[1:36:53.320 --> 1:36:55.280]  I'm going to stop ranting.
[1:36:55.280 --> 1:36:59.240]  It's just the level of deception these people have engaged in and it's across the board.
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:00.720]  The globalists know they're losing.
[1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:02.320]  They're going for broke.
[1:37:02.320 --> 1:37:03.320]  I appreciate him.
[1:37:03.320 --> 1:37:05.160]  He'll join us till five after next hour.
[1:37:05.160 --> 1:37:09.480]  Dr. Darren J. Beatty is a former professor at Political Science Duke University who went
[1:37:09.480 --> 1:37:13.280]  on to serve in the White House as speechwriter and political aide to Trump.
[1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:14.720]  He is now founder of Revolver News.
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:16.720]  This will be doing a great job of so many fronts.
[1:37:16.720 --> 1:37:22.680]  Revolver.News Darren J. Beatty on Twitter written some really powerful articles dealing
[1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:26.600]  with the libs of tip-talk doxing on covers.
[1:37:26.600 --> 1:37:32.720]  Secret hacker government mercenary alliance behind regimes war on MAGA Americans.
[1:37:32.720 --> 1:37:38.000]  And so what is this whole giant tip-talk doxing by the Washington Post and why is it such
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:39.920]  a big deal and what is it uncovered?
[1:37:39.920 --> 1:37:44.080]  Then we'll look at the implosion of Netflix and what that symbolizes and the latest on
[1:37:44.080 --> 1:37:45.400]  Elon Musk as well.
[1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:46.840]  Dr. Thank you for joining us.
[1:37:46.840 --> 1:37:50.240]  Thanks for sitting there while I was ranting, but this is just getting insane.
[1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:53.360]  It's great to be here, as always.
[1:37:53.360 --> 1:37:55.840]  So, where do you want to start here?
[1:37:55.840 --> 1:37:59.240]  A lot going on over at Revolver News, a lot happening in the world.
[1:37:59.240 --> 1:38:00.240]  Indeed.
[1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:04.720]  Well, I think we should start at this libs of tip-talk article because this has been
[1:38:04.720 --> 1:38:06.000]  all over the news.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:10.560]  There's so many dimensions of this that are of intense interest to the American public.
[1:38:10.560 --> 1:38:15.560]  So there's a surface story which I think most people know and the surface story is a scandal
[1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:16.800]  in its own right.
[1:38:16.800 --> 1:38:20.400]  You've got this deranged people who say she's aged.
[1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:24.560]  I think she looks good for a woman probably in her mid-50s.
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:30.600]  Her name is Taylor Lawrence, and she is a vicious reporter, wrote a piece for the Washington
[1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:40.240]  Post doxing a very popular, amusing, informative, anonymous account called libs of tip-talk.
[1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:45.080]  And I think probably a lot of your viewers have seen this, does great work in exposing
[1:38:45.080 --> 1:38:51.240]  the grooming agenda that exists across a variety of our educational institutions.
[1:38:51.240 --> 1:38:56.400]  And the purpose of doxing that is revealing someone's identity is very clear.
[1:38:56.400 --> 1:39:02.920]  We exist in a regime in which there is a very well-developed infrastructure to destroy the
[1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:08.520]  reputations, lives, and livelihoods of anyone who dares question the regime.
[1:39:08.520 --> 1:39:11.400]  That's the subject of your rant just earlier.
[1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:14.560]  People like you, people like me, they need to destroy us.
[1:39:14.560 --> 1:39:19.400]  But for ordinary citizens who want to do their part, they're even more vulnerable, and a
[1:39:19.400 --> 1:39:21.880]  lot of them have to operate under pseudonyms.
[1:39:21.880 --> 1:39:26.240]  And that's why the regime is so interested in exposing them to instill fear in their
[1:39:26.240 --> 1:39:31.000]  hearts and to ruin their lives as a message to anyone else who might dare go on their
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:36.200]  computer and say something that our corrupt and illegitimate regime doesn't like.
[1:39:36.200 --> 1:39:38.840]  And so that's enough of a story into its own right.
[1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:43.240]  But when you get down into the rabbit hole of this, you really discover what we're up
[1:39:43.240 --> 1:39:51.640]  against, because as it might not shock you that this unhinged, nut job reporter, she
[1:39:51.640 --> 1:39:54.160]  didn't do any of the actual legwork.
[1:39:54.160 --> 1:39:55.160]  Give me a break.
[1:39:55.160 --> 1:39:59.720]  You just have to look at her and know that she couldn't do anything resembling something
[1:39:59.720 --> 1:40:01.280]  requiring technical proficiency.
[1:40:01.280 --> 1:40:09.200]  No, of course, the actual work, the actual doxing work, was done by a man called Travis
[1:40:09.200 --> 1:40:14.080]  Brown, and he's noted in the Washington Post article.
[1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:19.760]  He uses a software that he developed that is a hate speech tracker, which of course
[1:40:19.760 --> 1:40:25.440]  means just tracking people who dare question the regime and exposing them.
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:27.320]  Okay, fair enough.
[1:40:27.320 --> 1:40:30.120]  But what really gets interesting is this.
[1:40:30.120 --> 1:40:32.440]  Who funded this hate speech tracker?
[1:40:32.440 --> 1:40:39.920]  Well, the hate speech tracker is funded by an NGO that receives its own funding principally
[1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:42.480]  from the German government.
[1:40:42.480 --> 1:40:49.400]  So the money goes from the German government to this tech incubator called Prototype.
[1:40:49.400 --> 1:40:57.200]  And Prototype funds this Antifa adjacent journalist doxing operations, which when successfully
[1:40:57.200 --> 1:41:03.920]  completed, then additionally laundered into the Washington Post where Taylor Lorenz writes
[1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:07.560]  the piece in order to destroy this person's life.
[1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:08.840]  That's very interesting.
[1:41:08.840 --> 1:41:14.040]  What are some of the other projects funded by this prototype organization that's bankrolled
[1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:15.040]  by the German government?
[1:41:15.040 --> 1:41:16.520]  And I want to talk about that.
[1:41:16.520 --> 1:41:21.160]  I want to talk about how US intelligence uses German groups so many times to carry out their
[1:41:21.160 --> 1:41:22.920]  criminal activity when we come back, doctor.
[1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:28.400]  But just the big issue here is that they used her as a victim cause celeb that when people
[1:41:28.400 --> 1:41:33.000]  criticize her, they call that hate speech and say it shouldn't be allowed, journalists
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:38.360]  should be protected because they're their arms of the of the deep state permanent state.
[1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:42.760]  And then she goes out and starts doxing people and people don't see the incredible hypocrisy
[1:41:42.760 --> 1:41:43.760]  of that.
[1:41:43.760 --> 1:41:44.760]  Right.
[1:41:44.760 --> 1:41:45.760]  It's amazing.
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:46.760]  Like that.
[1:41:46.760 --> 1:41:50.760]  That's the surface story, which is scandalous enough in its own right.
[1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:57.800]  The story underneath this is like the additional scandal apart from her hypocrisy is she didn't
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:41:59.800]  even actually do the work.
[1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:04.880]  It was a technically competent man who was doing the work behind this.
[1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:05.880]  Sure.
[1:42:05.880 --> 1:42:06.880]  That's the little thing about Netflix.
[1:42:06.880 --> 1:42:10.160]  Not that there aren't good female directors, but almost all the female directors is really
[1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:11.160]  a man.
[1:42:11.160 --> 1:42:13.480]  But then the directive came down have all the directors be female.
[1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:15.080]  So it's all men behind women.
[1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:19.960]  And it's the same thing using a young woman as a cut out for a German connected intelligence,
[1:42:19.960 --> 1:42:24.440]  private intelligence agency to harass Americans that use tactics they've used in Germany to
[1:42:24.440 --> 1:42:28.120]  suppress the population, which a lot of it lends back to the Stasi.
[1:42:28.120 --> 1:42:32.960]  As we know, we'll talk to Dr. Beatty when we come back on the other side, revolver.news.
[1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:38.600]  I'm Alex Jones with info wars.com, info wars.com tomorrow's news today, and it's a revolutionary
[1:42:38.600 --> 1:42:43.560]  act to share links like info wars.com and revolver.news.
[1:42:43.560 --> 1:42:46.760]  When you do that, I know you're awake folks, but other people aren't and they're ready
[1:42:46.760 --> 1:42:47.880]  to hear the truth now.
[1:42:47.880 --> 1:42:53.160]  So share the links daily from revolver.news and info wars.com, but whatever you do, spread
[1:42:53.160 --> 1:43:22.720]  the word about freedom period.
[1:43:23.160 --> 1:43:27.960]  In full wars, it's paradoxical is more popular than ever is reaching more people than ever,
[1:43:27.960 --> 1:43:32.560]  despite the censorship, but because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure

[1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:22.560]  domestic terror, the days of independent media are numbered, the government has made it illegal
[1:44:22.560 --> 1:44:23.560]  to oppose them.
[1:44:23.560 --> 1:44:24.560]  They are now deep banking us behind the scenes.
[1:44:24.560 --> 1:44:25.560]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[1:44:25.560 --> 1:44:29.360]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps, the
[1:44:29.360 --> 1:44:35.760]  traders know they can shut us down by force, but that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[1:44:35.760 --> 1:44:36.760]  So be it.
[1:44:36.760 --> 1:44:39.680]  Make them silence us by force.

[1:45:02.240 --> 1:45:04.640]  the United States from Canada to Germany.
[1:45:04.640 --> 1:45:08.120]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go, then coming to your
[1:45:08.120 --> 1:45:13.800]  house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their
[1:45:13.800 --> 1:45:14.800]  facilities.
[1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:19.600]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:23.560]  quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[1:45:23.560 --> 1:45:25.360]  This is nothing less than martial law.

[1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:33.880]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning US government military

[1:46:59.440 --> 1:47:14.440]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:14.440 --> 1:47:22.680]  To the town of Alfri who rode a stranger one fine day Hardly spoke to folks around him
[1:47:22.680 --> 1:47:30.080]  didn't have too much to say, no one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make
[1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:31.080]  this step.
[1:47:31.080 --> 1:47:35.320]  One of the biggest stories of the last week is the lives of TikTok getting doxed by a
[1:47:35.320 --> 1:47:41.480]  Washington Post reporter who herself had complained about people even criticizing her
[1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:48.600]  and the media saying that shouldn't be done, but Dr. Darren G. J. Beatty with revolver.news
[1:47:48.600 --> 1:47:52.760]  who's a former professor of political science Duke University and a former advisor and speech
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:58.560]  driver for President Trump, he has been able to track back off public information who really
[1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:02.040]  did the doxing and how they're using this woman as a cut out.
[1:48:02.040 --> 1:48:05.960]  So Dr. Beatty, please continue with this big breaking news.
[1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:07.520]  Absolutely.
[1:48:07.520 --> 1:48:15.360]  So as I mentioned, the software used for this doxing that another individual actually performed,
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:18.960]  it was in Taylor Lorenz, another guy called Travis Brown did it.
[1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:26.520]  He was using software that was whose development was funded by a German government project
[1:48:26.520 --> 1:48:28.680]  is called the prototype fund.
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:33.480]  It's a project of open knowledge foundation Germany and it's funded by the federal ministry
[1:48:33.480 --> 1:48:35.960]  of education and research.
[1:48:35.960 --> 1:48:41.720]  And among other things, this organization funds projects to expose the quote unquote
[1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:46.800]  fake news and by that, they of course don't mean the actual fake news, they mean the news
[1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:49.640]  outlets that dare to question regime narratives.
[1:48:49.640 --> 1:48:56.760]  They also have quite fascinating projects that they fund, among which is software for
[1:48:56.760 --> 1:48:59.760]  voice training for trans people.
[1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:04.840]  And so the same organization that was paid to dox, libs of pick talk is also paying to
[1:49:04.840 --> 1:49:10.840]  teach male to female transgenders how to not sound like very white.
[1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:14.160]  Sounds like a worthwhile use of money.
[1:49:14.160 --> 1:49:18.080]  And of course, here's where it gets really interesting Alex is they also funded something
[1:49:18.080 --> 1:49:23.480]  called the Syrian archive, which is meant to expose human rights abuses in Syria.
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:31.560]  Now the original advertisement for this is very kind of sneaky about what perspective
[1:49:31.560 --> 1:49:32.720]  they have on Syria.
[1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:38.320]  But if you go to the website, it's very clear the whole project is meant to reinforce regime
[1:49:38.320 --> 1:49:45.000]  propaganda that's been long debunked regarding the Assad chemical weapons attack and so forth.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:49.440]  And so irrespective of what you think about the Syria thing, what's interesting is the
[1:49:49.440 --> 1:49:56.280]  pattern that emerges is that this government funded NGO is not only supporting dox efforts
[1:49:56.280 --> 1:50:02.320]  against domestic political speech in the West, it's also doing projects to reinforce the
[1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:06.200]  foreign policy geopolitical agenda of the regime.
[1:50:06.200 --> 1:50:11.200]  And this isn't an isolated case, we see this pattern repeatedly, for instance, there's
[1:50:11.200 --> 1:50:18.160]  an organization called Bellingcat, which is affiliated with the British government.
[1:50:18.160 --> 1:50:24.640]  And Bellingcat does much the same thing, it engages in dox operations to expose and demonize
[1:50:24.640 --> 1:50:31.000]  and terrorize political dissenters within the West, and it also engages in reinforcement
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:38.520]  efforts to advance whatever the current agenda is against Russia or Syria, they were involved
[1:50:38.520 --> 1:50:43.040]  in the Skirpal hoax and all kinds of other things.
[1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:45.840]  And not only that, there's also anonymous.
[1:50:45.840 --> 1:50:51.760]  Now, anonymous is this hacker group that pretends to be independent, they're just people who
[1:50:51.760 --> 1:50:55.000]  want to expose the truth and challenge power.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:51:00.960]  Well, I find it very interesting that one of the co-founders of Anonymous took credit
[1:51:00.960 --> 1:51:07.680]  for the hack that exposed people who were donating to the trucker convoy in Canada.
[1:51:07.680 --> 1:51:11.400]  Well, that's right, and that guy's a well-known front for other people with government connections,
[1:51:11.400 --> 1:51:13.880]  they just use him to take credit.
[1:51:13.880 --> 1:51:19.920]  And so this guy who is associated with Anonymous takes credit for the hack exposing people
[1:51:19.920 --> 1:51:25.200]  who are supporting the truck convoy effort in Canada, and the same organization, this
[1:51:25.200 --> 1:51:31.000]  is a clip on the Revolver article, right in the early throes of the Ukraine-Russia conflict,
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:36.240]  Hillary Clinton went into an interview and she said that she supports the efforts of
[1:51:36.240 --> 1:51:42.040]  private hacker groups, including Anonymous, to engage in cyber war against Russia.
[1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:46.680]  So we know what it is, it's Western intelligence and corporate intelligence groups harassing
[1:51:46.680 --> 1:51:51.040]  domestic populations, and they're even hiring foreign countries out so they have plausible
[1:51:51.040 --> 1:51:54.040]  deniability, and that just shows you what Jeff Bezos is doing.
[1:51:54.040 --> 1:52:00.680]  Alex, the real take-home point here is this shows something crucial about the whole ecology
[1:52:00.680 --> 1:52:07.120]  that sustains this domestic war on terror engaged by our national security apparatus,
[1:52:07.120 --> 1:52:13.080]  and that is there's this whole gray zone of mercenary groups operating with plausible
[1:52:13.080 --> 1:52:18.920]  deniability, these hacker groups that are effectively working on behalf of the government,
[1:52:18.920 --> 1:52:25.280]  not independently, that are behind these doxing operations to terrorize domestic dissenters
[1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:26.640]  within the West.
[1:52:26.640 --> 1:52:28.600]  And that's what we need to understand.
[1:52:28.600 --> 1:52:33.720]  Just as you saw in the Iraq war, there was this development where you had private contractor
[1:52:33.720 --> 1:52:40.880]  organizations like Blackwater, this is sort of the equivalent of that in the NGO cyberspace
[1:52:40.880 --> 1:52:45.240]  of hacker groups doing the dirty work for the government that they want an arm's length
[1:52:45.240 --> 1:52:52.120]  from, and that's really the darkest and most dangerous aspect of this Taylor Lawrence doxing
[1:52:52.120 --> 1:52:53.120]  affair.
[1:52:53.120 --> 1:52:57.440]  Well, and you're right, I didn't even know about this organization, man, to the left
[1:52:57.440 --> 1:53:01.440]  had a bunch of these organizations around the world, until I saw your article and I
[1:53:01.440 --> 1:53:03.760]  went and looked it up there, it was hiding in plain view.
[1:53:03.760 --> 1:53:08.040]  I was even getting into, look at this hypocrite, she says anyone criticizing her should be
[1:53:08.040 --> 1:53:12.240]  censored, you can't criticize a Washington Post writer, while she's doxing people.
[1:53:12.240 --> 1:53:17.920]  But that's only the first layer of the onion, you dig into it, she's a cut out for corporate
[1:53:17.920 --> 1:53:20.680]  bullying harassment organizations.
[1:53:20.680 --> 1:53:21.680]  Absolutely.
[1:53:21.680 --> 1:53:26.160]  I mean, that's really the irony layered on top of it is she's getting so much hate for
[1:53:26.160 --> 1:53:31.400]  engaging in the doxing, but even in a weird way, that's even giving her too much credit
[1:53:31.400 --> 1:53:37.440]  because any kind of actual competent work is so far past her that she's just taking
[1:53:37.440 --> 1:53:40.400]  up the dox effort that was conducted by someone.
[1:53:40.400 --> 1:53:42.360]  Oh, she's just a young pretty girl.
[1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:47.760]  It's not her, you know, it's not a big dangerous CIA cut out grip or anything.
[1:53:47.760 --> 1:53:53.040]  He's just a just a young helpless girl in her, likely in her mid fifties, who's highly
[1:53:53.040 --> 1:53:56.600]  sensitive about her age, which is another amusing aspect of this.
[1:53:56.600 --> 1:53:58.920]  I was being sarcastic, exactly.
[1:53:58.920 --> 1:54:02.840]  Shifting gears into Netflix's implosion and what's going on Elon Musk and all of it.
[1:54:02.840 --> 1:54:03.840]  This is getting rich quick.
[1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:10.080]  I see the Netflix implosion as a bellwether of just the accelerating exodus out of Hollywood.
[1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:15.440]  Yeah, it's a collapsing institution, and it's so important.
[1:54:15.440 --> 1:54:20.560]  And that's like a lot of the same dynamics that account for what Twitter actually is
[1:54:20.560 --> 1:54:22.840]  and the market force is governing it.
[1:54:22.840 --> 1:54:28.560]  I think also applied to Netflix and Netflix is in many ways is a kind of social engineering
[1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:36.880]  project, and you see the way that the political agenda is egregiously and gratuitously inserted
[1:54:36.880 --> 1:54:42.600]  into all of their originals has become almost a joke now on the internet, a meme of, oh,
[1:54:42.600 --> 1:54:48.800]  here's the newest Netflix special with some outrageous display of woke social engineering.
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:54.600]  So it's very comforting to see that it's experiencing some financial difficulties.
[1:54:54.600 --> 1:55:01.040]  But if it's practice in the social engineering arena is important enough to the elites, they'll
[1:55:01.040 --> 1:55:03.600]  find some way to bail it out and sustain it.
[1:55:03.600 --> 1:55:08.600]  Because ultimately the work that it does in brainwashing the population and distracting
[1:55:08.600 --> 1:55:15.000]  the population in helping to shape people's understanding of reality, which is what entertainment
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:16.600]  and media does.
[1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:21.360]  If that's important enough to the regime that they need things like Netflix, so they'll,
[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:22.960]  I think, do what they can.
[1:55:22.960 --> 1:55:24.960]  Well, exactly.
[1:55:24.960 --> 1:55:28.960]  That's the point I was going to make is it's like a missile, a javelin missile.
[1:55:28.960 --> 1:55:31.040]  You expect a missile to get blown up.
[1:55:31.040 --> 1:55:32.160]  It's taking something out.
[1:55:32.160 --> 1:55:38.840]  So CNN having no viewers falling apart, Netflix falling apart, you're like, why are they destroying
[1:55:38.840 --> 1:55:39.840]  themselves?
[1:55:39.840 --> 1:55:44.360]  Because that's their mission is to culturally derange and bring us down and just give us
[1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:46.480]  ugly art, ugly literature, ugly everything.
[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:48.240]  So we will accept dystopia.
[1:55:48.240 --> 1:55:49.240]  It's very simple.
[1:55:49.240 --> 1:55:51.360]  So they're carrying their mission out.
[1:55:51.360 --> 1:55:55.640]  Their mission is to destroy themselves in the process of destroying us.
[1:55:55.640 --> 1:55:56.640]  Exactly.
[1:55:56.640 --> 1:56:02.800]  Their job, their regular conventional market forces don't apply to these organizations.
[1:56:02.800 --> 1:56:06.960]  Their job is not to provide the product that people actually want.
[1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:13.120]  Their job is to make the regime's propaganda as palatable as possible, but it's always
[1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:18.560]  subject to that chief criterion is does this serve the agenda of the regime?
[1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:21.840]  And if it steps out of that, they're no longer serving their purpose.
[1:56:21.840 --> 1:56:22.840]  Dr. BD, don't hang up.
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:23.840]  We've got a two minute break.
[1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:26.240]  We'll do five minutes with you on a big January 6th.
[1:56:26.240 --> 1:56:30.200]  Governor Whitmer development earlier, the expert on this, I know the listeners are sick
[1:56:30.200 --> 1:56:31.200]  of it.
[1:56:31.200 --> 1:56:32.200]  I'm sick of it too.
[1:56:32.200 --> 1:56:35.360]  But if they're betting their whole midterms in 202 days on this, so this is really critical.
[1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:37.360]  We'll come back with that information briefly.
[1:56:37.360 --> 1:56:39.760]  And then your phone calls in the third hour.
[1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:41.160]  Let's give the number out right now.
[1:56:41.160 --> 1:56:43.840]  First time callers, long time callers, disagree, agree.
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:44.960]  We're not censoring your calls.
[1:56:44.960 --> 1:56:45.960]  Just have a topic.
[1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:46.960]  Have a clean telephone.
[1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:47.960]  That's all I ask.
[1:56:47.960 --> 1:56:48.960]  That's all I ask for.
[1:56:48.960 --> 1:56:49.960]  877-789-2589.
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:50.960]  Again, that's 877-789-2539.
[1:56:50.960 --> 1:56:55.960]  Gosh, I've been saying that number for 20 years.
[1:56:55.960 --> 1:56:56.960]  877-789-2539.
[1:56:56.960 --> 1:56:57.960]  877-789-ALEX.
[1:56:57.960 --> 1:57:06.880]  Again, 877-789-2539 or ALEX at the end.
[1:57:06.880 --> 1:57:09.440]  Some people overseas can't dial a 1-800 number.
[1:57:09.440 --> 1:57:17.000]  So we have the international line 01512-646-1776 and your calls are coming up in about T minus
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  seven minutes.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:20.640]  But I want to hit this big developing news.
[1:57:20.640 --> 1:57:24.640]  Justin, Federal Prosecutor, drops out of Governor Whitmer and Ledge, kidnapped in case that
[1:57:24.640 --> 1:57:28.080]  is blown up in their face spectacularly.
[1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:30.160]  We'll be back in hour number three.
[1:57:30.160 --> 1:57:34.520]  Please don't forget, we're doing a fundraiser right now to stay on air and be strong.
[1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:35.520]  You support us.
[1:57:35.520 --> 1:57:36.520]  We're going to stay on air.
[1:57:36.520 --> 1:57:37.520]  It's a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
[1:57:37.520 --> 1:57:38.760]  It's not the full bankruptcy.
[1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:40.560]  We're going nowhere if you support us.
[1:57:40.560 --> 1:57:41.560]  Thanks for the support.
[1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:50.880]  We have over 100 designs of t-shirts that just sit there in our warehouse.
[1:57:50.880 --> 1:57:55.720]  We need to sell those shirts to fund the operation, but we've already made some orders on future
[1:57:55.720 --> 1:57:56.720]  shirts coming in.
[1:57:56.720 --> 1:57:57.720]  But these are all limited editions.
[1:57:57.720 --> 1:58:00.760]  So once these new shirts come in, we're going to sell those, and that's it.
[1:58:00.760 --> 1:58:05.000]  We'll have limited editions one at a time in the future, and when they're gone, they're
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  gone.
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:07.520]  Well, here's the new limited edition shirt.
[1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:09.920]  This one is $24.95, a really nice fabric.
[1:58:09.920 --> 1:58:14.800]  Alex Jones was right on the front with a big red lightning bolt on the back, infowars.com.
[1:58:14.800 --> 1:58:18.840]  You talk about triggering, you talk about spreading the word, you talk about waking people up.
[1:58:18.840 --> 1:58:19.840]  Alex Jones was right.
[1:58:19.840 --> 1:58:23.320]  Fundraiser shirt, we need the funds to operate.
[1:58:23.320 --> 1:58:24.320]  Infowarsstore.com.
[1:58:24.320 --> 1:58:25.320]  Alex Jones was right.
[1:58:25.320 --> 1:58:26.720]  It's a gorgeous shirt.
[1:58:26.720 --> 1:58:27.720]  We're really proud of it.

[1:58:48.080 --> 1:58:49.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[1:58:49.920 --> 1:58:53.360]  I need your help keeping infowars on the air and strong.
[1:58:53.360 --> 1:58:57.360]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[1:58:57.360 --> 1:58:58.560]  I was born for this.
[1:58:58.560 --> 1:59:03.040]  You were born for this, and people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our
[1:59:03.040 --> 1:59:08.040]  own infrastructure because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions
[1:59:08.040 --> 1:59:09.040]  of dollars.
[1:59:09.040 --> 1:59:13.400]  And now, with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[1:59:13.400 --> 1:59:19.320]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[1:59:19.320 --> 1:59:20.320]  of charge.
[1:59:20.320 --> 1:59:25.120]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[1:59:25.120 --> 1:59:29.600]  Infowars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[1:59:29.600 --> 1:59:35.920]  movement worldwide, but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds
[1:59:35.920 --> 1:59:40.800]  of thousands of dollars a month, so the biggest sale in infowars history is going right now,
[1:59:40.800 --> 1:59:45.520]  the mega-emergency blowout sale, up to 75% off, getting credible products, and keeping
[1:59:45.520 --> 1:59:50.320]  infowars as strong as ever.
[1:59:50.320 --> 1:59:56.320]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:59:56.320 --> 2:00:08.120]  All right, welcome back into hour number three as we wage war on corruption as we crash the
[2:00:08.120 --> 2:00:14.480]  lies and disinformation and defiance of the censors and leftist control freaks.
[2:00:14.480 --> 2:00:21.720]  It's Wednesday, April 20th, 2022, and I wanted to get Dr. Darren J. Beatty back on from Revolver.News
[2:00:21.720 --> 2:00:26.640]  in this last little segment to comment on the wheels coming off of the Whitmer kidnapping
[2:00:26.640 --> 2:00:31.040]  plot and what that means for January 6th, and this latest federal prosecutor drops out
[2:00:31.040 --> 2:00:33.960]  of Governor Whitmer alleged kidnapping case.
[2:00:33.960 --> 2:00:39.480]  This is a real-time collapse of this House of Cards.
[2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:41.480]  What do you make of this, Dr. Beatty?
[2:00:41.480 --> 2:00:47.880]  Yeah, it's a complete embarrassment, a complete collapse of their case, but what I'm really
[2:00:47.880 --> 2:00:50.040]  looking for is accountability.
[2:00:50.040 --> 2:00:55.960]  It's great that the case itself has gone nowhere, that it's a spectacular failure, but ultimately
[2:00:55.960 --> 2:00:59.320]  the narrative itself is arguably a success.
[2:00:59.320 --> 2:01:04.320]  The narrative still dominates the regime's efforts to repurpose the national security
[2:01:04.320 --> 2:01:07.960]  apparatus against Trump supporters politically.
[2:01:07.960 --> 2:01:13.240]  And so until we can affect, through our reporting, through our coverage, through talking about
[2:01:13.240 --> 2:01:21.800]  it like we are now, until we can affect that connection between the collapse of what actually
[2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:26.760]  is going on in terms of this trial, in terms of all these narratives, and the power of
[2:01:26.760 --> 2:01:33.400]  the agenda, which is this agenda to weaponize the national security state, our work isn't
[2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:34.400]  done.
[2:01:34.400 --> 2:01:38.760]  And so I think that always needs to be in the background of every discussion regarding
[2:01:38.760 --> 2:01:42.360]  how embarrassing this must be to the DOJ.
[2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:49.600]  It was never ultimately about these handful of hapless and, in some cases, even homeless
[2:01:49.600 --> 2:01:54.480]  defendants who were set up in this ridiculous entrapment operation.
[2:01:54.480 --> 2:01:57.360]  It was never really about them or their fate.
[2:01:57.360 --> 2:01:58.920]  They were always expendable.
[2:01:58.920 --> 2:02:04.880]  What it was always about is using these people to engineer a larger narrative that could
[2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:11.200]  shape the direction of the country and shape it in a way that is extremely dark and extremely
[2:02:11.200 --> 2:02:15.840]  dangerous and which has largely been successful over the past several years.
[2:02:15.840 --> 2:02:16.840]  Well, you're right.
[2:02:16.840 --> 2:02:22.600]  I mean, if you tune into any Democrat propaganda, all they talk about is domestic white supremacists,
[2:02:22.600 --> 2:02:26.960]  Trump supporters, or terrorists, anyone questioning elections or forced injections or not wearing
[2:02:26.960 --> 2:02:28.360]  masks or terrorists.
[2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:33.200]  They have alerts on NBC News, ABC News, oh, oh, they're questioning lockdowns, oh, they
[2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:34.200]  question elections.
[2:02:34.200 --> 2:02:38.280]  It's just a hysteric attempt to outlaw their political opposition.
[2:02:38.280 --> 2:02:41.200]  I don't see it working unless they stage a false flag.
[2:02:41.200 --> 2:02:42.800]  In fact, we had a big poll.
[2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:46.320]  48,000 people voted on it in just one day on infowars.com.
[2:02:46.320 --> 2:02:49.040]  The poll still open, closes in a few hours.
[2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:53.680]  How will Dems distract from failures ahead of 2022 midterms?
[2:02:53.680 --> 2:02:58.920]  Focus on January 6th, 11%, Blaine Putin 30%, called GOP Grimers 2%.
[2:02:58.920 --> 2:03:00.960]  False flag attack, 56%.
[2:03:00.960 --> 2:03:01.960]  I think they're right.
[2:03:01.960 --> 2:03:07.360]  I think false flags, they'll move the deep state once.
[2:03:07.360 --> 2:03:11.680]  I think this is very possible, and we'll just have to be extra vigilant for it.
[2:03:11.680 --> 2:03:17.080]  That is one thing I think that is very positive feature of all the coverage we've done, the
[2:03:17.080 --> 2:03:22.680]  coverage you've done, sort of exposing these false narratives behind not only Michigan,
[2:03:22.680 --> 2:03:28.560]  but behind January 6th as well, is that even though a lot of the narrative damage remains
[2:03:28.560 --> 2:03:34.040]  for now at least, what it does, it makes it much harder for them to pull off a successful
[2:03:34.040 --> 2:03:40.880]  false flag in the future, because people have been so accustomed now to seeing what a lie
[2:03:40.880 --> 2:03:46.920]  all of this stuff is, they've seen multiple sub-narratives just collapse before their
[2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:53.160]  very eyes, whether it's the Michigan thing, whether it was the fire hydrant attack that
[2:03:53.160 --> 2:03:59.320]  they claimed there was a Capitol police officer was killed by a fire hydrant with a frothing
[2:03:59.320 --> 2:04:04.960]  MAGA mob, that was just just as small at all of it exactly.
[2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:07.520]  And then when you've got the State Department being accused of being liars, when they say
[2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:12.200]  Russia may do a false flag, and Russia says the US is doing false flags in NATO, the fact
[2:04:12.200 --> 2:04:16.640]  is people are educated now about false flags, and it's legitimate to ask that question,
[2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:19.880]  and that takes away the element of surprise the permanent state had.
[2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:26.160]  And you know what Alex, the funny thing is kind of ironic, the trust that the American
[2:04:26.160 --> 2:04:30.440]  people, and really the global community has in the American government, and particularly
[2:04:30.440 --> 2:04:37.960]  the American intelligence organization, the trust is so resoundingly low that even when
[2:04:37.960 --> 2:04:42.040]  they pretty much got it right, remember when all the intel people were saying that Russia
[2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:47.200]  is going to go and believe it, no one believed it, no one believed it because everyone knows
[2:04:47.200 --> 2:04:49.880]  that the intel agencies are such liars.
[2:04:49.880 --> 2:04:53.480]  So I think that's actually an ironic example.
[2:04:53.480 --> 2:04:58.760]  It is, Dr. Beatty, amazing interview, revolver.news, thank you so much.
[2:04:58.760 --> 2:05:05.840]  Over the years, M4 Wars has produced more than 200 amazing Patriot Americana, Second
[2:05:05.840 --> 2:05:11.200]  Amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts, ball caps, flags, you name it.
[2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:15.600]  All of the apparel and the flags are being sold at cost right now, that's just regular
[2:05:15.600 --> 2:05:22.920]  plain chain shirts, that is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us 15, 20, 25 dollars to
[2:05:22.920 --> 2:05:27.000]  produce, we used to sell for 40, we're selling them for 15, selling them for 20, whatever
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  the shirt costs us.
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  If a shirt costs five dollars, we're selling it for five dollars for us to actually produce.
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:35.680]  It costs ten dollars, we're selling it for ten dollars, and we've got hoodies, and we've
[2:05:35.680 --> 2:05:39.640]  got long sleeves, and we've got short sleeves, we've got them all, and we've got to liquidate
[2:05:39.640 --> 2:05:44.480]  them all, and they're limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs.
[2:05:44.480 --> 2:05:49.400]  Again, we are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited, limited edition
[2:05:49.400 --> 2:05:50.400]  of the future.
[2:05:50.400 --> 2:05:55.280]  We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air, plus it spreads the word, infowarstore.com,
[2:05:55.280 --> 2:05:57.640]  your historic apparel now, infowarstore.com.
[2:05:57.640 --> 2:06:14.600]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:14.600 --> 2:06:19.400]  We are now six minutes and ten seconds into hour number three today, we're going to be
[2:06:19.400 --> 2:06:28.080]  talking to Big Mac, Ken, Robert, Richard, Josh, Ed, Barney, Carlos, Rodney, and many others
[2:06:28.080 --> 2:06:34.920]  here in the shower, and we've got some other big breaking news as well, but wow, what is
[2:06:34.920 --> 2:06:40.120]  going to happen next with all the crazy things that are happening?
[2:06:40.120 --> 2:06:42.520]  Let's go to these calls in the order they were received.
[2:06:42.520 --> 2:06:51.000]  The first call is from Pennsylvania, that's Robert in Pennsylvania on supply chain breakdown,
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:53.400]  works in transportation as an analyst.
[2:06:53.400 --> 2:06:55.360]  Robert, great to hear your expertise.
[2:06:55.360 --> 2:06:56.360]  Tell us what's happening.
[2:06:56.360 --> 2:06:57.360]  Hey, Alex.
[2:06:57.360 --> 2:06:58.360]  Welcome, sir.
[2:06:58.360 --> 2:06:59.360]  Actually, just ordered to the fundraiser.
[2:06:59.360 --> 2:07:09.800]  Give me a favor, talk right into your telephone, you're not getting good connection.
[2:07:09.800 --> 2:07:10.800]  Talk right into the telephone.
[2:07:10.800 --> 2:07:11.800]  All right.
[2:07:11.800 --> 2:07:12.800]  Is this any better?
[2:07:12.800 --> 2:07:13.800]  It is.
[2:07:13.800 --> 2:07:14.800]  Go ahead.
[2:07:14.800 --> 2:07:15.800]  All right.
[2:07:15.800 --> 2:07:19.320]  So I really, I just wanted to talk about my first hand experience of watching the supply
[2:07:19.320 --> 2:07:21.360]  chain slowly break down.
[2:07:21.360 --> 2:07:25.200]  I've worked for a couple of the larger carriers.
[2:07:25.200 --> 2:07:32.520]  I now work for a very small transportation company, and over the last two years, we have
[2:07:32.520 --> 2:07:39.480]  seen a huge spike in volume at the start of the pandemic, and now volume is lower than
[2:07:39.480 --> 2:07:43.080]  I've seen in, you know, five years of doing this.
[2:07:43.080 --> 2:07:48.320]  The volume across the board, number of deliveries going out is, it's astonishing how low it
[2:07:48.320 --> 2:07:50.320]  is.
[2:07:50.320 --> 2:07:51.800]  And I mean, it's honestly terrifying.
[2:07:51.800 --> 2:07:54.040]  I don't know if people are, you know, just running out of money.
[2:07:54.040 --> 2:07:55.040]  Yeah.
[2:07:55.040 --> 2:07:56.040]  And they have a word for that.
[2:07:56.040 --> 2:07:57.040]  It's called a depression.
[2:07:57.040 --> 2:07:58.040]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:07:58.040 --> 2:08:03.600]  So explain to people again, you're an analyst that looks at supply, and I'm involved in
[2:08:03.600 --> 2:08:05.960]  supply, obviously, because I'm somebody that sells my products.
[2:08:05.960 --> 2:08:09.000]  I mean, I've never heard of anything this bad.
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:12.720]  Elaborate on why you're saying this is so, so scary.
[2:08:12.720 --> 2:08:17.400]  So I actually, I'm an operations manager for a trucking company.
[2:08:17.400 --> 2:08:24.880]  I handle the on the ground operations, forecasting, basically day to day, and we work with a couple
[2:08:24.880 --> 2:08:26.960]  of larger carriers.
[2:08:26.960 --> 2:08:35.080]  And from this time last year, our volume is down almost 25%.
[2:08:35.080 --> 2:08:40.160]  With gas prices going up between volume being down, prices going up, it's making it really
[2:08:40.160 --> 2:08:41.560]  hard to survive in the industry.
[2:08:41.560 --> 2:08:47.240]  I mean, I'm cutting budgets constantly, just to try to keep people paid, make ends meet.
[2:08:47.240 --> 2:08:52.120]  As where, you know, two years ago, the end of 2019 into the beginning of 2020 was, I
[2:08:52.120 --> 2:08:55.640]  mean, an incredible moneymaker for us.
[2:08:55.640 --> 2:09:03.280]  But I mean, we've seen 25% drop in volume, and we've lost probably 8% of our profit margins.
[2:09:03.280 --> 2:09:05.800]  So for the big carriers, it's fine.
[2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:10.400]  But for us, you know, the small local guys and the little guy, they're getting screwed
[2:09:10.400 --> 2:09:11.400]  on all of this.
[2:09:11.400 --> 2:09:12.400]  Well, exactly.
[2:09:12.400 --> 2:09:13.400]  That's why the globalists are doing this.
[2:09:13.400 --> 2:09:17.680]  They admit, because you're quote, non-essential, this will get rid of all the small and medium
[2:09:17.680 --> 2:09:18.680]  carriers.
[2:09:18.680 --> 2:09:25.640]  And then in time, that we passed on to the consumer because the big companies like Walmart
[2:09:25.640 --> 2:09:28.880]  and Amazon basically are behind all this.
[2:09:28.880 --> 2:09:32.520]  It's a very serious situation and getting rid of the smaller companies that actually
[2:09:32.520 --> 2:09:37.560]  produce goods as well will cause shortages in the future, which is, again, the post-industrial
[2:09:37.560 --> 2:09:39.880]  world we've been artificially put into.
[2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:44.880]  Hey, I couldn't have said it better myself.
[2:09:44.880 --> 2:09:47.440]  And then all these people won't have jobs, but oh, it's okay now.
[2:09:47.440 --> 2:09:48.640]  You're not on welfare.
[2:09:48.640 --> 2:09:52.920]  You've got a universal basic income, but now they can dictate to you how to live your
[2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:56.760]  life if you want to still get that money.
[2:09:56.760 --> 2:09:58.720]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:09:58.720 --> 2:10:01.320]  Total control.
[2:10:01.320 --> 2:10:05.120]  So are you seeing it get progressively worse, or is there any lot at the end of the tunnel
[2:10:05.120 --> 2:10:10.480]  because they've really squeezed and shut down the worldwide just-on-time delivery system,
[2:10:10.480 --> 2:10:14.720]  which took decades to even get in place, as you know, or is it progressively getting worse
[2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:19.720]  because that's what I'm seeing, or is it slowing down in its downward slider?
[2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:22.880]  What's the trajectory?
[2:10:22.880 --> 2:10:30.400]  As of late, I'd say over the last six months, even through the holiday season, it's gotten
[2:10:30.400 --> 2:10:31.400]  progressively worse.
[2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:36.960]  I mean, obviously, you had the holiday spike in between Thanksgiving and Christmas, but
[2:10:36.960 --> 2:10:42.440]  after that, instead of it being a slow taper, I mean, it was just a complete drop.
[2:10:42.440 --> 2:10:47.840]  I had five trucks, five drivers that I had to lay off the last two weeks of the year
[2:10:47.840 --> 2:10:50.240]  because there was no volume.
[2:10:50.240 --> 2:10:56.320]  And I didn't get back to full running capacity until about three weeks ago.
[2:10:56.320 --> 2:11:00.720]  And even then, I'm just barely making enough money to break even.
[2:11:00.720 --> 2:11:08.200]  So I mean, as of right now, I don't really see it going up anytime soon, or ever for
[2:11:08.200 --> 2:11:09.200]  that matter.
[2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:12.520]  And if it does, it will barely keep us above water.
[2:11:12.520 --> 2:11:17.720]  Well, that's why I get so mad at headlines from Kudlow on Fox Business.
[2:11:17.720 --> 2:11:19.200]  Biden doesn't seem to care.
[2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:20.200]  He's an idiot.
[2:11:20.200 --> 2:11:21.200]  Doesn't know what he's doing.
[2:11:21.200 --> 2:11:23.480]  No, they know exactly what they're doing.
[2:11:23.480 --> 2:11:25.200]  This is economic warfare.
[2:11:25.200 --> 2:11:26.480]  Thank you so much, Robert.
[2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:27.480]  I appreciate the call.
[2:11:27.480 --> 2:11:29.680]  Yeah, that's what I'm trying to explain to listeners.
[2:11:29.680 --> 2:11:30.760]  Our costs have gone up.
[2:11:30.760 --> 2:11:31.760]  We can't get products.
[2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:32.760]  I'm not bitching.
[2:11:32.760 --> 2:11:36.960]  I know you're in a bad shape as well, most of you probably, but that's why I get really
[2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:41.440]  angry when the news is up there lying and saying, court documents show they've got $60
[2:11:41.440 --> 2:11:42.760]  million.
[2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:46.920]  And they count three years of us buying product checks going out saying that that's secret
[2:11:46.920 --> 2:11:47.920]  money we have.
[2:11:47.920 --> 2:11:49.760]  It's just it's lies.
[2:11:49.760 --> 2:11:53.560]  And I'm not going to prove to people how serious things are by shutting down.
[2:11:53.560 --> 2:11:57.600]  I'm going to sit here and explain to people and get the money in to keep operating.
[2:11:57.600 --> 2:11:59.320]  But we need to stay on air.
[2:11:59.320 --> 2:12:00.720]  We're essential.
[2:12:00.720 --> 2:12:01.960]  All of you are essential as well.
[2:12:01.960 --> 2:12:07.000]  But I'm saying info wars needs to be on the air during this period of time.
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:10.200]  I could easily just say I've done my tour 28 years.
[2:12:10.200 --> 2:12:13.680]  I'm done and just, you know, get out of here of the crew could too.
[2:12:13.680 --> 2:12:16.320]  But that would be abandoning the ship.
[2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:20.440]  That would be turning my back on people and I'm not doing it.
[2:12:20.440 --> 2:12:23.520]  And I've been told, you keep doing what you're doing.
[2:12:23.520 --> 2:12:24.520]  You're going to get you.
[2:12:24.520 --> 2:12:26.800]  Well, I mean, you're going to get me anyways.
[2:12:26.800 --> 2:12:28.200]  I can't back down.
[2:12:28.200 --> 2:12:30.720]  I just can't do it.
[2:12:30.720 --> 2:12:32.720]  And I don't think it's a weakness.
[2:12:32.720 --> 2:12:33.920]  I think it's a strength I've got.
[2:12:33.920 --> 2:12:34.920]  But I don't know.
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:35.920]  You can't back down either.
[2:12:35.920 --> 2:12:38.880]  But I'm telling you, if you're not consciously spreading the word about the show and spread
[2:12:38.880 --> 2:12:42.360]  the articles and videos, and if you're not praying for the broadcast and yourself as
[2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:45.120]  well and your family, and if you're not buying the products, you might as well just join
[2:12:45.120 --> 2:12:46.120]  the New World Order.
[2:12:46.120 --> 2:12:48.840]  Because you can't just sit there and like, well, I support you.
[2:12:48.840 --> 2:12:51.600]  But no, no, no, we're in this together.
[2:12:51.600 --> 2:12:56.400]  And I bet my life on this because I believe in you and we're so close to beating these
[2:12:56.400 --> 2:12:58.120]  people.
[2:12:58.120 --> 2:12:59.720]  But we just got to keep pressing ahead.
[2:12:59.720 --> 2:13:00.720]  Okay.
[2:13:00.720 --> 2:13:01.720]  Let's take another call.
[2:13:01.720 --> 2:13:02.720]  Who's up next here?
[2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:07.880]  Let's go to a caller in Kentucky.
[2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:09.520]  Let's talk to Ed in Kentucky.
[2:13:09.520 --> 2:13:10.520]  Ed, thanks for holding.
[2:13:10.520 --> 2:13:11.520]  Go ahead.
[2:13:11.520 --> 2:13:12.520]  Can you hear me?
[2:13:12.520 --> 2:13:13.520]  Yes, sir.
[2:13:13.520 --> 2:13:14.520]  I can't.
[2:13:14.520 --> 2:13:15.520]  Go ahead.
[2:13:15.520 --> 2:13:20.080]  First off, you're a hero to so many people, but I just wanted to say as far as you not
[2:13:20.080 --> 2:13:22.960]  turning your back on people who are spreading the word.
[2:13:22.960 --> 2:13:29.120]  I remember when Jason Miller, the CEO of Gator came on your show to promote your audience
[2:13:29.120 --> 2:13:32.240]  to go to his site to stream your show.
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:37.480]  If you go to your show's live stream right now and you type in the words, so Linsky is
[2:13:37.480 --> 2:13:41.640]  a Nazi, they will ban you from your own chat.
[2:13:41.640 --> 2:13:43.800]  And that's not even controversial.
[2:13:43.800 --> 2:13:47.200]  He showed up to Congress with a Nazi iron cross on his shirt.
[2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:48.560]  I mean, he, he worked.
[2:13:48.560 --> 2:13:49.560]  He runs with the...
[2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:52.240]  I mean, Gator's not bad folks, but they're running scared.
[2:13:52.240 --> 2:13:55.200]  They don't want to get banned off their servers.
[2:13:55.200 --> 2:13:59.320]  They don't want to have to build servers like we did and spend $4 million.
[2:13:59.320 --> 2:14:04.200]  I mean, I'm not going to get into it, but we have our own servers literally under a
[2:14:04.200 --> 2:14:09.920]  mountaintop, just as a matter of the point is, yeah, I mean, I understand why they do
[2:14:09.920 --> 2:14:10.920]  it, but it doesn't mean it's good.
[2:14:10.920 --> 2:14:11.920]  You know what I mean?
[2:14:11.920 --> 2:14:16.520]  Yeah, it's definitely not good, because there's a loyal bunch of info warriors there who just
[2:14:16.520 --> 2:14:18.320]  come to talk and, you know, network...
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:20.160]  I mean, so Linsky is a Nazi.
[2:14:20.160 --> 2:14:25.040]  He's a Nazi like Marilyn Albright's dad or George Soros, who were Jews that worked
[2:14:25.040 --> 2:14:27.040]  for the Nazis.
[2:14:27.040 --> 2:14:28.480]  I knew you would, I knew you would know.
[2:14:28.480 --> 2:14:29.480]  I knew you would get it.
[2:14:29.480 --> 2:14:34.040]  I'll just, I just wanted to let you know that they're using your stream and banning people
[2:14:34.040 --> 2:14:36.040]  who discuss obvious things.
[2:14:36.040 --> 2:14:40.160]  Well, I'll hold you overhead, because I wanted to get your other point about stuff, but or
[2:14:40.160 --> 2:14:42.360]  finish up if you've got time.
[2:14:42.360 --> 2:14:43.360]  Okay.
[2:14:43.360 --> 2:14:45.160]  I don't understand my stream to ban people.
[2:14:45.160 --> 2:14:47.440]  I don't know what that means.
[2:14:47.440 --> 2:14:53.600]  I mean, like info wars has a stream on Gitter, you can live stream the show and you can actually
[2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:56.600]  discuss things with people who are watching the show with you.
[2:14:56.600 --> 2:14:57.600]  And it's pretty cool.
[2:14:57.600 --> 2:14:59.400]  Like there's a bunch of people who come there every day.
[2:14:59.400 --> 2:15:00.400]  It's awesome.
[2:15:00.400 --> 2:15:01.400]  Sure.
[2:15:01.400 --> 2:15:02.400]  It's 10 to 1000 comments a day.
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:03.400]  Yeah.
[2:15:03.400 --> 2:15:04.400]  It's nice.
[2:15:04.400 --> 2:15:05.400]  Well, I'm talking about not the comments.
[2:15:05.400 --> 2:15:06.400]  I'm talking about live streaming.
[2:15:06.400 --> 2:15:08.280]  Like, I can actually watch the show right now.
[2:15:08.280 --> 2:15:12.840]  There are people in your chat right now who know who I am, who are probably going like
[2:15:12.840 --> 2:15:15.600]  crazy people and the real deal is it's fun.
[2:15:15.600 --> 2:15:19.800]  And then if you type in something simple about what's going on today in today's news, like
[2:15:19.800 --> 2:15:22.960]  as the lens key is a Nazi, you will get banned.
[2:15:22.960 --> 2:15:27.040]  A lot of that is I know in the CEO who's a good guy got confronted on Tim Pool.
[2:15:27.040 --> 2:15:28.040]  He backed off some stuff.
[2:15:28.040 --> 2:15:29.600]  Maybe I should talk to him about that.
[2:15:29.600 --> 2:15:30.600]  It might be moderators.
[2:15:30.600 --> 2:15:34.640]  You know, we've had moderators too before that went too far because we can't have folks
[2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:38.200]  call for violence and things on info wars and people got pissed at us, but I'll look
[2:15:38.200 --> 2:15:39.200]  into it.
[2:15:39.200 --> 2:15:40.200]  Thank you.
[2:15:40.200 --> 2:15:41.200]  Add for the call.
[2:15:41.200 --> 2:15:42.200]  All right.
[2:15:42.200 --> 2:15:43.200]  More calls straight ahead in T minus four minutes.
[2:15:43.200 --> 2:15:44.600]  And I like Gitter.
[2:15:44.600 --> 2:15:45.600]  I like rumble.
[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:46.600]  I like Gav.
[2:15:46.600 --> 2:15:47.600]  I like them all.
[2:15:47.600 --> 2:15:48.600]  Are they perfect?
[2:15:48.600 --> 2:15:53.480]  No, none of us are, but but I hear you that they don't want to copy the Democrats for
[2:15:53.480 --> 2:15:57.760]  for God's sake.
[2:15:57.760 --> 2:16:02.320]  You know, it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true that info wars
[2:16:02.320 --> 2:16:10.360]  is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist
[2:16:10.360 --> 2:16:15.040]  resistance against their transhumanist anti human program.
[2:16:15.040 --> 2:16:21.720]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever
[2:16:21.720 --> 2:16:22.720]  done.
[2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:28.880]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at infowarstore.com
[2:16:28.880 --> 2:16:32.080]  and we are funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[2:16:32.080 --> 2:16:36.680]  And so now we need to support more than ever because this fight has intensified.
[2:16:36.680 --> 2:16:40.280]  Don't need me to tell you that at info wars.com.
[2:16:40.280 --> 2:16:44.240]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[2:16:44.240 --> 2:16:48.600]  Things have been sold out for a long time like info wars life, fizzy magnesium mix that's
[2:16:48.600 --> 2:16:53.080]  so amazing and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[2:16:53.080 --> 2:16:58.840]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at infowarstore.com right now with the world awakening.
[2:16:58.840 --> 2:17:01.920]  I think what's important that we were at the momentum right now take advantage of this
[2:17:01.920 --> 2:17:06.080]  moment and I have all of an idea that something everybody can do with every listener can do.
[2:17:06.080 --> 2:17:10.600]  I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to hang banners over highways.
[2:17:10.600 --> 2:17:15.480]  Imagine a champion or a piece of a land up in Atlanta that says Alex Jones is right infowarstore.com
[2:17:15.480 --> 2:17:18.280]  or we stand with the truckers or rest out or whatever it is.
[2:17:18.280 --> 2:17:20.880]  Brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this.
[2:17:20.880 --> 2:17:21.880]  Yes.
[2:17:21.880 --> 2:17:25.360]  Now is the time in your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom
[2:17:25.360 --> 2:17:31.120]  wall or to put a sticker on your car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain
[2:17:31.120 --> 2:17:32.120]  reaction.
[2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:34.040]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[2:17:34.040 --> 2:17:36.360]  I have a few ideas.
[2:17:36.360 --> 2:17:42.800]  Rest out, rest out, swap, the vaccine is poison, there's tons of things I say just keep it
[2:17:42.800 --> 2:17:43.800]  short, keep it concise.
[2:17:43.800 --> 2:17:44.800]  No, I agree.
[2:17:44.800 --> 2:17:47.640]  Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates, the COVID-vaxx is poison.
[2:17:47.640 --> 2:17:48.640]  Beautiful.
[2:17:48.640 --> 2:17:49.640]  Yeah.
[2:17:49.640 --> 2:17:51.640]  There's ways that we could all be involved and we could all be effective though.
[2:17:51.640 --> 2:17:52.640]  That's what I'm calling about.
[2:17:52.640 --> 2:17:53.640]  God bless you, Chris.
[2:17:53.640 --> 2:17:56.880]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[2:17:56.880 --> 2:17:57.880]  Thank you so much.
[2:17:57.880 --> 2:18:02.240]  Introducing the newest product from infowarstore.com.
[2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:05.760]  We are so proud of infowars life immune support.
[2:18:05.760 --> 2:18:11.960]  It is concentrated herbs that are known on record to supercharge our body's natural

[2:20:26.760 --> 2:20:33.760]  I'm Alex Jones and I'm the host of the New World Order show on this Wednesday, April
[2:20:33.760 --> 2:20:34.760]  20th broadcast.
[2:20:34.760 --> 2:20:40.760]  And I see the name Ernest in Texas been holding 11 minutes, son passed away from vaccine
[2:20:40.760 --> 2:20:42.760]  update on fighting back.
[2:20:42.760 --> 2:20:47.760]  I would love to have Ernest in studio with us and his son died after he got one of these
[2:20:47.760 --> 2:20:50.760]  shots and he's traveled the country exposing it.
[2:20:50.760 --> 2:20:55.760]  So Ernest, we really appreciate you coming on and we appreciate your update, Ernest.
[2:20:55.760 --> 2:21:00.200]  We appreciate you pushing this subject, how you've been helping everyone, not just myself.
[2:21:00.200 --> 2:21:02.120]  And I really do appreciate it.
[2:21:02.120 --> 2:21:03.120]  It means a lot.
[2:21:03.120 --> 2:21:04.120]  I appreciate you brother.
[2:21:04.120 --> 2:21:07.360]  I'm so sad for what happened to your son.
[2:21:07.360 --> 2:21:10.560]  Remindable who your son is and who's alive in heaven by the way.
[2:21:10.560 --> 2:21:12.440]  We're all eternal.
[2:21:12.440 --> 2:21:16.760]  But what happened to him during this existence on this planet?
[2:21:16.760 --> 2:21:17.760]  Yes.
[2:21:17.760 --> 2:21:23.080]  Well, I was a single parent, you know, junior was my world.
[2:21:23.080 --> 2:21:27.480]  I, you know, took care of my baby was all my mind.
[2:21:27.480 --> 2:21:33.560]  And when they came up about this so-called whatever they want to call it, being safe
[2:21:33.560 --> 2:21:38.200]  and effective, which was a lie to everyone.
[2:21:38.200 --> 2:21:42.240]  I got him vaccinated exactly April 19th, a year yesterday.
[2:21:42.240 --> 2:21:43.240]  Wow.
[2:21:43.240 --> 2:21:51.480]  And five days later, he passed away from myocarditis and a large heart, which will be this Sunday.
[2:21:51.480 --> 2:21:53.520]  And I mean, it tears me up every day.
[2:21:53.520 --> 2:21:58.080]  People just don't realize that because he's all I ever had.
[2:21:58.080 --> 2:22:02.280]  But you know what happened to him and you being his father and you going to speak it
[2:22:02.280 --> 2:22:05.240]  in D.C. and all over the country, you've reached hundreds of millions of people, not
[2:22:05.240 --> 2:22:06.560]  just here but worldwide.
[2:22:06.560 --> 2:22:08.640]  Your son's death has saved a lot of lives.
[2:22:08.640 --> 2:22:12.320]  Ernest, I know that's hard, but at the end of the day, I know you know that deep down.
[2:22:12.320 --> 2:22:14.320]  Your son has saved a lot of people.
[2:22:14.320 --> 2:22:15.320]  Yes, sir.
[2:22:15.320 --> 2:22:19.360]  I know that's what he was wanting me to do because he knows the type of person I am.
[2:22:19.360 --> 2:22:21.920]  Because I'd always taught him how to be a man.
[2:22:21.920 --> 2:22:23.240]  Well, he sees what you're doing, man.
[2:22:23.240 --> 2:22:24.640]  We're eternal beings of light.
[2:22:24.640 --> 2:22:25.960]  Your son is alive right now.
[2:22:25.960 --> 2:22:26.960]  Yes, sir.
[2:22:26.960 --> 2:22:31.880]  I believe that because like I always said, I feel my son pushing me and I feel the good
[2:22:31.880 --> 2:22:33.360]  Lord guiding my path.
[2:22:33.360 --> 2:22:36.320]  So, you know, I'm going to keep doing this.
[2:22:36.320 --> 2:22:40.720]  No matter who tries to quiet me up or shut me down, no one will do that.
[2:22:40.720 --> 2:22:44.040]  The only one that's going to stop me is the good Lord when it takes me home.
[2:22:44.040 --> 2:22:46.560]  So you know, people can say what they want to say.
[2:22:46.560 --> 2:22:50.160]  I mean, I have not really got very much negative feedback.
[2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:51.160]  I've got so much support.
[2:22:51.160 --> 2:22:53.760]  Well, I'm glad you called in because I want an update.
[2:22:53.760 --> 2:22:57.040]  I want to invite you in the studio tomorrow, the next day of your back in Austin.
[2:22:57.040 --> 2:22:59.120]  But I want to talk to you, sir, about this.
[2:22:59.120 --> 2:23:03.080]  What do you make of the Health and Human Services head admitting that minorities are
[2:23:03.080 --> 2:23:07.680]  twice as likely to die from the shots than white people and the head of AstraZeneca admitting
[2:23:07.680 --> 2:23:11.600]  you shouldn't take the shot if you have an autoimmune or problem that can kill you?
[2:23:11.600 --> 2:23:12.800]  We already knew that.
[2:23:12.800 --> 2:23:13.800]  We warned people.
[2:23:13.800 --> 2:23:14.960]  They tried to block us.
[2:23:14.960 --> 2:23:16.760]  What do you make of these admissions?
[2:23:16.760 --> 2:23:23.040]  Well, my question is, how come they never answered me when I called them the health department?
[2:23:23.040 --> 2:23:26.920]  You know, I mean, I was probably one of the first ones trying to call them and they ignored
[2:23:26.920 --> 2:23:27.920]  my calls.
[2:23:27.920 --> 2:23:30.120]  To this day, they still haven't called me back.
[2:23:30.120 --> 2:23:33.400]  I mean, these people, they knew what was going on.
[2:23:33.400 --> 2:23:35.560]  Why weren't they honest about it?
[2:23:35.560 --> 2:23:38.800]  We could have prevented a lot of injuries and death.
[2:23:38.800 --> 2:23:39.800]  I mean, I know.
[2:23:39.800 --> 2:23:40.800]  You know, I earn this.
[2:23:40.800 --> 2:23:41.800]  They were taking money.
[2:23:41.800 --> 2:23:42.800]  They were falling a script.
[2:23:42.800 --> 2:23:43.800]  Exactly, exactly.
[2:23:43.800 --> 2:23:49.360]  I mean, like I said, I met a lot of wonderful people injured victims for the wrong reasons,
[2:23:49.360 --> 2:23:54.920]  but they, they bring life back into my life because I, you know, I try to support them
[2:23:54.920 --> 2:23:56.560]  and they're here to support me also.
[2:23:56.560 --> 2:24:01.600]  Well, God bless you and your son, Ernest Ramirez, Jr.
[2:24:01.600 --> 2:24:02.600]  What is the update, my friend?
[2:24:02.600 --> 2:24:09.240]  Well, I just want to let you know, too, there's a billboard's going up now, CHD, the Children's
[2:24:09.240 --> 2:24:15.080]  Health Defense, asked my permission to use my son's photo and I gave him permission,
[2:24:15.080 --> 2:24:17.760]  of course, because we need to spread this.
[2:24:17.760 --> 2:24:22.880]  So they put a picture of my son about, you know, it's not, it's real, not rare about
[2:24:22.880 --> 2:24:24.480]  how fires are killing my son.
[2:24:24.480 --> 2:24:28.920]  They murdered him and there's a picture of my son on the billboard and another one next
[2:24:28.920 --> 2:24:31.760]  to it of me standing next to my son's coffin.
[2:24:31.760 --> 2:24:36.240]  They also have a little Maddie DeGerry picture on the billboard also.
[2:24:36.240 --> 2:24:39.320]  Now these billboards are starting to pop up everywhere.
[2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:43.080]  Brother, we appreciate your courage and your strength and what the devil means for bad
[2:24:43.080 --> 2:24:45.120]  God's going to use for good.
[2:24:45.120 --> 2:24:49.240]  Just I could, I couldn't imagine I got four children and I got, I got one son, he's 19
[2:24:49.240 --> 2:24:51.720]  and I just couldn't imagine if this had happened.
[2:24:51.720 --> 2:24:53.120]  It's just so painful.
[2:24:53.120 --> 2:24:56.040]  Not anyone, not even an enemy, I wouldn't wish this.
[2:24:56.040 --> 2:24:57.880]  I mean, it's, it's terrible.
[2:24:57.880 --> 2:25:02.120]  We have hate and anger to people and I wouldn't even wish this on them.
[2:25:02.120 --> 2:25:05.720]  What do you want to say to Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and all that?
[2:25:05.720 --> 2:25:06.720]  Has this come out?
[2:25:06.720 --> 2:25:07.720]  They knew what they were doing.
[2:25:07.720 --> 2:25:08.720]  What do you want to say to them, Mr. Ramirez?
[2:25:08.720 --> 2:25:13.480]  Oh, I want them to stand up, be a man, stand up, especially with me, please, invite me
[2:25:13.480 --> 2:25:16.520]  somewhere, meet me face to face.
[2:25:16.520 --> 2:25:19.280]  I'll be in Columbus, Ohio, May 4th.
[2:25:19.280 --> 2:25:22.800]  I have another engagement to speak at and I'm going to rattle the house.
[2:25:22.800 --> 2:25:23.800]  I'm sorry.
[2:25:23.800 --> 2:25:24.800]  I'm tired of being nice.
[2:25:24.800 --> 2:25:27.720]  I'm going to, I'm going to stop putting people out there on blast.
[2:25:27.720 --> 2:25:30.040]  I'm going to, you'll, you'll see.
[2:25:30.040 --> 2:25:33.760]  If I don't get arrested or shot, you know, I'm going to do it in the right manner because
[2:25:33.760 --> 2:25:36.040]  of the way I've been trying to do it calmly.
[2:25:36.040 --> 2:25:39.360]  And again, some people say, well, Mr. Ramirez should have known, no, you, you believe in
[2:25:39.360 --> 2:25:40.360]  the system.
[2:25:40.360 --> 2:25:41.360]  You're a veteran.
[2:25:41.360 --> 2:25:44.200]  You believe they weren't lying to you and they broke their contract with you.
[2:25:44.200 --> 2:25:48.240]  They screwed you over your son and they murdered your son and they think it's funny.
[2:25:48.240 --> 2:25:50.400]  But the good news is you didn't roll over and take it.
[2:25:50.400 --> 2:25:53.920]  You're fighting back and reaching millions now, these huge rallies and the shows you
[2:25:53.920 --> 2:25:58.440]  go to your, you are an inspiration to us all and to your son.
[2:25:58.440 --> 2:25:59.440]  Thank you, sir.
[2:25:59.440 --> 2:26:00.440]  I really appreciate that.
[2:26:00.440 --> 2:26:03.600]  And I just want everyone to protect your, protect your babies.
[2:26:03.600 --> 2:26:05.720]  Take care of one another, not just your children.
[2:26:05.720 --> 2:26:09.600]  We need to turn to our neighbor and protect them also because that's what I'm doing.
[2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:11.600]  I'm trying to protect your children.
[2:26:11.600 --> 2:26:14.720]  So what have you experienced now traveling the country?
[2:26:14.720 --> 2:26:16.360]  I know you've been tireless.
[2:26:16.360 --> 2:26:17.360]  What have you experienced?
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:18.360]  What have you seen?
[2:26:18.360 --> 2:26:24.360]  Well, to be honest, all the love and support up from everyone, I can't tell everyone thank
[2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:28.720]  you enough because they come up, give condolences, give me hugs.
[2:26:28.720 --> 2:26:29.720]  I mean, I have no fear.
[2:26:29.720 --> 2:26:30.720]  I don't wear a mask.
[2:26:30.720 --> 2:26:35.320]  You know, so they, I have one gentleman asked me, why don't you wear a mask at these events?
[2:26:35.320 --> 2:26:36.320]  Why should I?
[2:26:36.320 --> 2:26:38.720]  This is a scare attack that they used on us.
[2:26:38.720 --> 2:26:40.000]  I fell for it.
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.240]  I don't want you to fall for it.
[2:26:42.240 --> 2:26:46.480]  You know, so I mean, sure we're going to get sick, but we have natural, maybe our bodies
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:47.480]  going to fight.
[2:26:47.480 --> 2:26:48.480]  What's all about?
[2:26:48.480 --> 2:26:49.480]  Yes, sir.
[2:26:49.480 --> 2:26:53.720]  So, I mean, and like I've always tell everybody, if you see me, I've had people, they don't
[2:26:53.720 --> 2:26:54.720]  want to upset me.
[2:26:54.720 --> 2:26:55.960]  No, you're not upsetting me.
[2:26:55.960 --> 2:26:58.840]  You see me at a restaurant at a gas station.
[2:26:58.840 --> 2:26:59.840]  It doesn't matter.
[2:26:59.840 --> 2:27:04.920]  So, please come up, talk to me, shake my hand, whatever, ask me questions.
[2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:06.520]  That's what I'm here for.
[2:27:06.520 --> 2:27:07.520]  Even though...
[2:27:07.520 --> 2:27:08.520]  Beautiful.
[2:27:08.520 --> 2:27:09.520]  How do people find you on Twitter?
[2:27:09.520 --> 2:27:15.960]  Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, I gave up my personal number because I have people, like
[2:27:15.960 --> 2:27:19.640]  I said, I have phone calls, emails, text messages from around the world.
[2:27:19.640 --> 2:27:22.720]  I have my phone on me all the time.
[2:27:22.720 --> 2:27:26.400]  Well, God bless you, sir, and listen, we'll put you on hold.
[2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:27.400]  Are you in Austin right now?
[2:27:27.400 --> 2:27:28.400]  We'd love to have you in the studio tomorrow.
[2:27:28.400 --> 2:27:30.000]  I haven't announced this yet.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  I think I did briefly.
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  We're going to have a same info wars, 24-hour broadcast, kicking off at 8 a.m. tomorrow.
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:38.560]  So anytime you want to come in tomorrow night or the night after that, we'd love to have
[2:27:38.560 --> 2:27:39.560]  you in the studio, sir.
[2:27:39.560 --> 2:27:42.720]  Okay, sounds good, sir, I appreciate that, really do.
[2:27:42.720 --> 2:27:43.720]  All right.
[2:27:43.720 --> 2:27:44.720]  Thank you, Ernest, senior.
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:46.600]  Put him on hold and get him in here.
[2:27:46.600 --> 2:27:49.480]  I've been really wanting him on, so I'm glad he got through and called in.
[2:27:49.480 --> 2:27:51.920]  Oh, my God, it makes me so angry.
[2:27:51.920 --> 2:27:53.680]  We're going to go to break him back with your calls.
[2:27:53.680 --> 2:27:54.680]  I just...
[2:27:54.680 --> 2:27:55.680]  These people, they just get away with it.
[2:27:55.680 --> 2:27:56.680]  They know what they're doing.
[2:27:56.680 --> 2:27:57.680]  They get so funny.
[2:27:57.680 --> 2:28:03.640]  They get so cute other killing people and I'm, I mean, his son being murdered is like
[2:28:03.640 --> 2:28:04.880]  my son being murdered.
[2:28:04.880 --> 2:28:08.160]  If we don't have empathy, we have nothing people.
[2:28:08.160 --> 2:28:14.880]  And it was the last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to see whole David Rockefeller
[2:28:14.880 --> 2:28:16.880]  Combine in prison.
[2:28:16.880 --> 2:28:17.880]  That means Bill Gates.
[2:28:17.880 --> 2:28:18.880]  That means Fauci.
[2:28:18.880 --> 2:28:19.880]  It means Peter Dazik.
[2:28:19.880 --> 2:28:25.600]  All these arrogant, crazy scientists think they're better than everybody and they like
[2:28:25.600 --> 2:28:27.160]  to play God and kill people.
[2:28:27.160 --> 2:28:28.520]  They think it's funny.
[2:28:28.520 --> 2:28:30.480]  They think it's cute to cook these viruses up.
[2:28:30.480 --> 2:28:34.400]  They think it's funny to release it and it's not funny.
[2:28:34.400 --> 2:28:40.000]  It's not cute and they're going to find out God's going to cut them down.
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:44.720]  They can run on for a long time like Johnny Cash says, but sooner or later, God's going
[2:28:44.720 --> 2:28:45.720]  to cut you down.
[2:28:45.720 --> 2:28:50.000]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with your phone calls on the other side of

[2:30:57.460 --> 2:31:01.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help. I need your help keeping InfoWars on the air
[2:31:01.580 --> 2:31:07.860]  and strong. I need your help making sure that our mission continues on. I was born for this.
[2:31:07.860 --> 2:31:12.300]  You were born for this. And people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our
[2:31:12.300 --> 2:31:17.340]  own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of millions
[2:31:17.340 --> 2:31:22.060]  of dollars. And now, with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're
[2:31:22.060 --> 2:31:28.260]  a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content
[2:31:28.260 --> 2:31:35.300]  free of charge. And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22. InfoWars and
[2:31:35.300 --> 2:31:39.980]  Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human-liberty movement worldwide.
[2:31:39.980 --> 2:31:45.620]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[2:31:45.620 --> 2:31:50.100]  of thousands of dollars a month. So, the biggest sale in InfoWars history is going right now,
[2:31:50.100 --> 2:31:54.820]  the mega-emergency blowout sale, up to 75% off, getting credible products and keeping
[2:31:54.820 --> 2:31:59.140]  InfoWars as strong as ever. Mike in California, thanks for calling. I think we're barking
[2:31:59.140 --> 2:32:04.100]  up the wrong tree calling this gain-of-function research. Now, if you read the actual, you
[2:32:04.100 --> 2:32:09.180]  know, 2014 legislation, the U.S. government gain-of-function deliberative process and
[2:32:09.180 --> 2:32:14.820]  research funding pause on selected gain-of-function research involving influenza, MERS, and ZARS
[2:32:14.820 --> 2:32:19.500]  viruses. There's nothing about ZARS-like viruses. And it's a research funding pause.
[2:32:19.500 --> 2:32:23.740]  It's not a stop. It's not a prohibition. It's when you come to a four-way intersection,
[2:32:23.740 --> 2:32:27.700]  there's the stop sign, you stop, you look both ways, and then you proceed. And so it's
[2:32:27.700 --> 2:32:32.060]  also, it doesn't pause all gain-of-function, just selected gain-of-function. But they'll
[2:32:32.060 --> 2:32:37.100]  argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research. So, you know,
[2:32:37.100 --> 2:32:40.100]  Rand and the others, you know, maybe Fauci was right. They don't quite know what they're
[2:32:40.100 --> 2:32:43.860]  talking about, calling it gain-of-function. You know, that's why he didn't perjure himself.
[2:32:43.860 --> 2:32:47.220]  That's why he hasn't been arrested. Because they're literally creating new synthetic
[2:32:47.220 --> 2:32:51.460]  life forms that mimic what the viruses do. But in the main definition, it's still a
[2:32:51.460 --> 2:32:55.140]  gain-of-function. You're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[2:32:55.140 --> 2:32:58.460]  Thank you, Mike. We love you.
[2:32:58.460 --> 2:33:20.460]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:20.460 --> 2:33:30.460]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time. Sooner
[2:33:30.460 --> 2:33:39.460]  or later, gotta cut you down, sooner or later, gotta cut you down. Go tell that long-tongued
[2:33:39.460 --> 2:33:40.460]  liar.
[2:33:40.460 --> 2:33:43.900]  Okay, we've got a few segments left, and then we've got our great guest hosts taking
[2:33:43.900 --> 2:33:50.300]  over. So let's go to your calls, the order they were received. Let's go ahead and talk
[2:33:50.300 --> 2:33:55.460]  to who would be the longest-holding person. Richard in Maine. Richard, thanks for calling.
[2:33:55.460 --> 2:33:56.460]  Go ahead.
[2:33:56.460 --> 2:33:57.940]  Yeah, hello, Alex. Can you hear me?
[2:33:57.940 --> 2:33:58.940]  Yes, sir. Go ahead.
[2:33:58.940 --> 2:34:02.620]  Yeah, I started ordering this. Thank you. I've been a huge fan since I was about 22
[2:34:02.620 --> 2:34:04.780]  and most. I'm 27 years old from Portland, A.C.
[2:34:04.780 --> 2:34:07.980]  I can hear you really good until you second you hear me. Just try to talk right on your
[2:34:07.980 --> 2:34:08.980]  phone again.
[2:34:08.980 --> 2:34:15.540]  Yeah. I'm 27 from Portland, Maine, and I'm proud to be an American. You woke me up.
[2:34:15.540 --> 2:34:20.100]  It's life-changing that you've dedicated your life to saving humanity. You've turned
[2:34:20.100 --> 2:34:23.340]  my life around and opened me up to care about the big picture to believe in God and to take
[2:34:23.340 --> 2:34:24.340]  a stand for others.
[2:34:24.340 --> 2:34:29.180]  I've been listening since 2012, and I've got many of your products, such as your signed
[2:34:29.180 --> 2:34:33.340]  card, which they came with a copy of as a game, a bunch of your flag stickers, and I've
[2:34:33.340 --> 2:34:37.820]  met many great people with any of your products. We all need to do our part, and I've done
[2:34:37.820 --> 2:34:42.620]  flyering, normal blobs, etc., and I've spent the award. And even started me to run for
[2:34:42.620 --> 2:34:46.740]  school board in my city. You can follow me on Facebook at Richard Lee, my award for
[2:34:46.740 --> 2:34:47.740]  school board.
[2:34:47.740 --> 2:34:50.460]  Yeah, brother, I really want to hear what you have to say, but it's weird. It's like
[2:34:50.460 --> 2:34:54.260]  you're moving the phone away or putting it into your shirt or something. Try to put it
[2:34:54.260 --> 2:34:57.020]  right in the receiver, right in your mouth. You're running for school board?
[2:34:57.020 --> 2:35:01.220]  Is that better? Yeah, I'm running for school board in Portland, Maine. You can follow me
[2:35:01.220 --> 2:35:06.940]  on Facebook at Richard Levi Award for Portland School Board. I'm taking a stand against sexualizing
[2:35:06.940 --> 2:35:12.500]  children and to end political indoctrination while supporting free speech. We're all in
[2:35:12.500 --> 2:35:17.660]  this together regardless of race and religion. They want us Godless, sexless, depressed, anxious,
[2:35:17.660 --> 2:35:22.300]  hate each other, childless, fat, drug addicted and isolated, but we're not going to surrender.
[2:35:22.300 --> 2:35:25.340]  And again, I want to thank you for inspiring so many people to take a stand for liberty
[2:35:25.340 --> 2:35:26.840]  and justice for all.
[2:35:26.840 --> 2:35:31.580]  Well, I'm trying, my friend, but I'm glad you're running for school board. How do folks
[2:35:31.580 --> 2:35:33.540]  find you again?
[2:35:33.540 --> 2:35:38.580]  You can follow me on Facebook at Richard Levi Award for Portland School Board. Should pop
[2:35:38.580 --> 2:35:39.580]  right up.
[2:35:39.580 --> 2:35:42.780]  I see it. You were the dog right there. All right, brother. Thanks for the call. Thank
[2:35:42.780 --> 2:35:48.820]  you. Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to a caller in Alabama. Let's talk
[2:35:48.820 --> 2:35:52.980]  to Seth in Alabama. Go ahead, Seth.
[2:35:52.980 --> 2:35:55.500]  Alex Jones, what a pleasure to talk to you, sir.
[2:35:55.500 --> 2:35:56.500]  Pleasure to talk to you, brother.
[2:35:56.500 --> 2:36:03.180]  Yes, sir. I was going to give you some information. My uncle, he is a big time pharmaceutical
[2:36:03.180 --> 2:36:10.260]  doctor. He started his career at UAB in Alabama and he has transitioned. I think he was ahead.
[2:36:10.260 --> 2:36:15.740]  They moved up to Nashville. He was over Vanderbilt Pharmacy at one point. They lived in Brentwood
[2:36:15.740 --> 2:36:20.420]  and they lived all by all the country music stars and all that. And since then he has
[2:36:20.420 --> 2:36:25.860]  been moved back down to UAB. And he told me that he was one of the ones that helped on
[2:36:25.860 --> 2:36:29.900]  the Moderna vaccine.
[2:36:29.900 --> 2:36:35.140]  And I was going to see if you had any info because I Google him, look him up all the time,
[2:36:35.140 --> 2:36:36.140]  but I don't know.
[2:36:36.140 --> 2:36:46.540]  I don't know who he is, but the Moderna shot is a GMO manipulation of your DNA gene therapy
[2:36:46.540 --> 2:36:53.660]  and is the most deadly shot there is. And it's just super bad news.
[2:36:53.660 --> 2:36:58.500]  That's what I was told. But he's a big time, like he's got degrees. He's originally from
[2:36:58.500 --> 2:37:03.460]  Texas. He's originally from San Antonio and he went to school. I think he's got degrees
[2:37:03.460 --> 2:37:10.060]  from Texas Tech and he's also got one from University of Texas at Austin. And he has
[2:37:10.060 --> 2:37:15.140]  done and recently he has been released from his job and he was over to the UAB pharmaceutical
[2:37:15.140 --> 2:37:20.660]  wing and I don't know if something internal went down between him and the rest of them,
[2:37:20.660 --> 2:37:23.220]  but I know it wasn't good.
[2:37:23.220 --> 2:37:28.860]  Well, brother, God bless you and we appreciate you. But I mean, it's a scientific dictatorship.
[2:37:28.860 --> 2:37:32.740]  If people can play God, there is a big incentive to go along with what the corporate leaders
[2:37:32.740 --> 2:37:37.140]  want and we just know it's Godless and it's absolutely out of control. Thank you so much
[2:37:37.140 --> 2:37:38.140]  for the call.
[2:37:38.140 --> 2:37:44.940]  All right. Up next is Rodney in Missouri, then Blake in New Jersey. Rodney in Missouri
[2:37:44.940 --> 2:37:45.940]  are on the air. Go ahead.
[2:37:45.940 --> 2:37:47.940]  Oh, it's awesome. Thanks, Alex.
[2:37:47.940 --> 2:37:48.940]  Thank you.
[2:37:48.940 --> 2:37:56.060]  I can talk to you. I got my corn. I got a year's supply of food. I got my X3. It's all great.
[2:37:56.060 --> 2:37:57.900]  And yeah, thank you for what you do.
[2:37:57.900 --> 2:38:01.180]  No, don't thank me. Thanks for keeping us on air and what you're doing. Thank you for
[2:38:01.180 --> 2:38:04.820]  being our booster. And thank you for being ready. But I bet you feel good about getting
[2:38:04.820 --> 2:38:05.820]  the food now.
[2:38:05.820 --> 2:38:08.660]  Food's short of just food. Rice is exploding. You made a good move.
[2:38:08.660 --> 2:38:14.620]  Yeah, absolutely. And the thing I wanted to talk to you about, I was there January 6th
[2:38:14.620 --> 2:38:20.980]  to listen to Trump's speech. And then me and my friend, we walked down to the Capitol
[2:38:20.980 --> 2:38:24.980]  and he got kind of freaked out. So, you know, we didn't stay there very long. We turned
[2:38:24.980 --> 2:38:29.700]  around and we're walking back, which I would have prayed. I'd pray hung out. But anyway,
[2:38:29.700 --> 2:38:35.140]  I was with him and my phone was about to die. But anyway, I talked to, I talked to Ray F
[2:38:35.140 --> 2:38:40.420]  on the way back. And he literally told me, he said, I prayed on it last night and I
[2:38:40.420 --> 2:38:47.220]  decided to go into the Capitol. He said, he said, he said, I went in. He said, someone
[2:38:47.220 --> 2:38:52.700]  had a seizure and he said, me and someone else carried him out. He said, we have medical
[2:38:52.700 --> 2:38:56.860]  emergency. And he said, everyone just parted and let us out of the out of the out of the
[2:38:56.860 --> 2:39:03.360]  out. You saw Ray F's. The Fed, I am. Yeah, I talked to him and he told me he was in the
[2:39:03.360 --> 2:39:08.220]  Capitol. It's just funny that senators are saying like, oh, conspiracy theorists. Ray
[2:39:08.220 --> 2:39:12.900]  F's was just a, I was just a protester. He wasn't in the Capitol. He literally, with
[2:39:12.900 --> 2:39:19.300]  his own words, told me he was in the Capitol. I talked at the guy. Where do you think this
[2:39:19.300 --> 2:39:27.700]  going Rodney? I don't know it's scary man I just found out I've got a I got
[2:39:27.700 --> 2:39:32.700]  another baby on the way I've got three beautiful little girls and it freaks me
[2:39:32.700 --> 2:39:38.260]  out it really does I'm driving a truck now to try to make enough money to make
[2:39:38.260 --> 2:39:43.860]  ends meet it's scary it really is. Well God bless you Rodney we're all in this
[2:39:43.860 --> 2:39:47.740]  together and as soon as we expose the Davos group it can all end but as soon as
[2:39:47.740 --> 2:39:51.820]  they can as long as they can hide out not get to blame for what they've done
[2:39:51.820 --> 2:39:55.940]  they're gonna keep doing it that's why identifying them is paramount. Let's talk
[2:39:55.940 --> 2:39:59.340]  to Carlos in Canada has actually been holding the longest. Carlos is a long
[2:39:59.340 --> 2:40:04.740]  time caller always informative Carlos what's your take on the situation? Alex
[2:40:04.740 --> 2:40:10.020]  two reasons why infowars must remain on the air number one the material I'm
[2:40:10.020 --> 2:40:14.260]  gonna give you today I've given you in the past as well but it's for people who
[2:40:14.260 --> 2:40:18.940]  call like and tell about their experiences like Ernest Ramirez who
[2:40:18.940 --> 2:40:25.060]  touched me dearly I want to tell you Alex Pfizer's original trial report on
[2:40:25.060 --> 2:40:30.340]  December 31st 2020 which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine
[2:40:30.340 --> 2:40:37.100]  was covered by a Canadian COVID care alliance which infowars reported on a
[2:40:37.100 --> 2:40:45.380]  while back on their report they analyze Pfizer's inoculations for COVID-19 more
[2:40:45.380 --> 2:40:51.340]  harm than good please if you're a criminal lawyer listening all over the
[2:40:51.340 --> 2:40:56.740]  world I know that other people are working on it but here's some res man
[2:40:56.740 --> 2:41:06.020]  mens rea and men's actum the Pfizer original trial report which these people
[2:41:06.020 --> 2:41:13.060]  500 doctors of this Canadian COVID care alliance reported showed two months
[2:41:13.060 --> 2:41:19.900]  worth of safety and efficacy data they described and made a claim that the
[2:41:19.900 --> 2:41:28.140]  Pfizer inoculations were safe and showed 95% efficacy seven days after the
[2:41:28.140 --> 2:41:35.620]  second dose but in fact the 95% efficacy was actually relative risk which is
[2:41:35.620 --> 2:41:39.580]  scientifically meaningless because of the fact that they didn't have a control
[2:41:39.580 --> 2:41:45.620]  group for this moreover relative risk deduction absolute risk deduction
[2:41:45.620 --> 2:41:53.700]  reduction was actually less than 1% 0.84% now the scientific data since on these
[2:41:53.700 --> 2:42:00.620]  treatments have revealed that in fact they don't work human immunity by

[2:49:27.780 --> 2:49:33.180]  in Illinois Ken thank you for calling. Good afternoon Alex thanks for taking my
[2:49:33.180 --> 2:49:37.420]  call for speaking with you I want to thank you and your crew for everything
[2:49:37.420 --> 2:49:44.060]  you do shedding a light on the truth I give your shirts away as gifts I talked
[2:49:44.060 --> 2:49:49.140]  to people try and wake them up against all the scams I realized there's so many
[2:49:49.140 --> 2:49:55.100]  scams going on everywhere look and I'm trying to do what I can just like you
[2:49:55.100 --> 2:50:00.460]  are and want to thank you guys one of the scams that I happen to notice I'm a
[2:50:00.460 --> 2:50:05.780]  life member of NRA and I know this is a little off topic of what we've been
[2:50:05.780 --> 2:50:12.140]  talking about lately but there's a deadline coming up for voting for the
[2:50:12.140 --> 2:50:20.820]  board of directors and NRA used to have their own TV show. Oh listen I don't
[2:50:20.820 --> 2:50:24.700]  think you're out of line already have this article ready to go and you called
[2:50:24.700 --> 2:50:30.340]  in Judge dismisses NRA bankruptcy case highlighting risk for dissolution of
[2:50:30.340 --> 2:50:36.260]  group the Democrats sued in New York under Soros control of T.C. James they
[2:50:36.260 --> 2:50:40.340]  want to shut the company down they try to go to Texas to declare bankruptcy and
[2:50:40.340 --> 2:50:45.980]  that got kicked out so now the NRA is facing shutdown another one of our free
[2:50:45.980 --> 2:50:49.940]  speech organizations where we use the First Amendment to defend the Second
[2:50:49.940 --> 2:50:54.460]  Amendment it shows you how every good organization that did the right thing is
[2:50:54.460 --> 2:50:58.500]  under attack and once they did all these criminal investigations the rest of it
[2:50:58.500 --> 2:51:02.460]  against them in the civil lawsuits they shut down their media operation that was
[2:51:02.460 --> 2:51:07.340]  already getting as big as Fox News. Yeah the problem isn't the organization I
[2:51:07.340 --> 2:51:12.460]  believe the members are being defrauded by Wayne LaPierre he needs to go the
[2:51:12.460 --> 2:51:17.340]  organization is one of the oldest fighting for our rights and it really is
[2:51:17.340 --> 2:51:22.380]  just it pains me to know that you've got people that have infiltrated using it
[2:51:22.380 --> 2:51:27.580]  for their own benefit and there should be a lawsuit but against him not against
[2:51:27.580 --> 2:51:32.500]  the organization that's the thing it drives me nuts you know you know here's
[2:51:32.500 --> 2:51:37.580]  the deal I was a huge creditor Wayne LaPierre 15 years ago but then they got
[2:51:37.580 --> 2:51:41.780]  more hardcore they got really pro-second amendment and did great things and so the
[2:51:41.780 --> 2:51:48.380]  left bitching that oh they went to an NRA event and and six or eight of the of the
[2:51:48.380 --> 2:51:51.900]  top executives flew in a private jet that's almost the same price as them all
[2:51:51.900 --> 2:51:57.900]  flying first-class I mean like $20,000 versus $18,000 I mean I just like
[2:51:57.900 --> 2:52:02.220]  saying to me and I'm not saying you're wrong brother I'm just saying the idea
[2:52:02.220 --> 2:52:06.380]  that because let me tell you they're not getting rid of Wayne LaPierre they're
[2:52:06.380 --> 2:52:12.100]  they're ending the NRA they're ending it as we know yeah I have a problem with
[2:52:12.100 --> 2:52:18.780]  that the issue I have is that this is an example of packing the courts you've got
[2:52:18.780 --> 2:52:25.540]  over 40 directors and there's only one worth as
[2:52:25.540 --> 2:52:31.460]  white now that isn't even being recommended that's Frank C. Tate from
[2:52:31.460 --> 2:52:38.700]  Wayne PA. There's a battle over every institution good and bad there's a
[2:52:38.700 --> 2:52:42.060]  fight over the NRA right now we should be fighting for its future I hear you we
[2:52:42.060 --> 2:52:47.020]  should be fighting for it even to exist anymore let's go ahead and go to Barney
[2:52:47.020 --> 2:52:55.580]  in Kentucky Barney go ahead hey Alex you hear me all right yes sir go ahead hey

[2:53:38.100 --> 2:53:44.860]  Institute for human relations and the committee of 300 and it got to me thinking
[2:53:44.860 --> 2:53:54.700]  about CIA and this information group and that brought me around to thinking
[2:53:54.700 --> 2:54:03.260]  about Steve Pachinic and whatever happened with him Steve Pachinic is off
[2:54:03.260 --> 2:54:09.140]  air because of medical issues I mean he's an old he's an old man okay okay so
[2:54:09.140 --> 2:54:14.300]  not bringing him back on anymore I know you guys had that deal yeah what was
[2:54:14.300 --> 2:54:18.260]  let me just cut to the chase we've been asking him on for six months and he's
[2:54:18.260 --> 2:54:21.540]  not come on the show and I'm not gonna give out his private information but I
[2:54:21.540 --> 2:54:26.060]  pretty much just told you okay so you don't you don't think he's this
[2:54:26.060 --> 2:54:34.140]  information CIA I mean he worked for the State Department in the CIA you have to
[2:54:34.140 --> 2:54:39.100]  go off what he says or what he does not not you look we're not we're not screen
[2:54:39.100 --> 2:54:41.980]  your call you're on air what do you want to say about Steve Pachinic hey hey
[2:54:41.980 --> 2:54:46.060]  you're on air what do you want to say about it just go ahead I was just asking
[2:54:46.060 --> 2:54:50.860]  cuz you know he said all that crap about the thing and water mark ballots and
[2:54:50.860 --> 2:54:56.500]  nothing to come of it and you know I was wondering if you want to have him back
[2:54:56.500 --> 2:55:01.220]  on the show to explain what what he was talking about and I'm telling you that
[2:55:01.220 --> 2:55:06.980]  I've asked him on the show and he doesn't feel well okay well right on man
[2:55:06.980 --> 2:55:11.500]  yeah have a stock in suit for human relations committee of 300 nobody's
[2:55:11.500 --> 2:55:17.300]  read it a better no you're right Barney and I appreciate your call I'll get on
[2:55:17.300 --> 2:55:21.740]  that and look I'm not defensive about Pachinic he's a guest on the show I'm
[2:55:21.740 --> 2:55:26.020]  not I've never met him in person I'm not like hanging out with him talking on
[2:55:26.020 --> 2:55:30.620]  the phone even every six months to him I believe he meant well I believe he
[2:55:30.620 --> 2:55:35.460]  wanted America to reject Joe Biden and so he said a lot of things some things
[2:55:35.460 --> 2:55:39.980]  I can prove some things I can't but I'm not my brother's keeper and I can't sit
[2:55:39.980 --> 2:55:45.300]  here and speak to what he was specifically saying and doing I didn't
[2:55:45.300 --> 2:55:50.540]  believe there were watermarks I didn't believe that Biden wouldn't be
[2:55:50.540 --> 2:55:56.540]  inaugurated on the 20th I said that Pachinic said what he said he's his own
[2:55:56.540 --> 2:56:01.180]  man and it's a very reasonable question to ask me well where is Pachinic on your
[2:56:01.180 --> 2:56:08.180]  show well he won't come on and I'm told he'll get better soon so I'm guessing
[2:56:08.180 --> 2:56:12.820]  that means he's sick but I don't want to start rumors I don't know it was he'll be
[2:56:12.820 --> 2:56:20.660]  better soon he'll come on but he you know 90% of what he talked about over the
[2:56:20.660 --> 2:56:27.420]  years came true very accurate very smart guy I like him but when it got into the
[2:56:27.420 --> 2:56:31.740]  queue stuff and Trump's invincible and Trump's gonna remain in office in
[2:56:31.740 --> 2:56:36.860]  January 20th I said I think you're wrong Pachinic and and so just because the guy
[2:56:36.860 --> 2:56:41.260]  worked for the government doesn't mean he's good or bad I mean you understand
[2:56:41.260 --> 2:56:46.180]  the CIA is not like being a movie star but there's only like 500 of them the
[2:56:46.180 --> 2:56:49.900]  CIA is one of the biggest government corporations there is the world with
[2:56:49.900 --> 2:56:55.660]  millions of people so some association with the CIA is not like oh my god the
[2:56:55.660 --> 2:57:01.060]  person was involved the CIA oh well what does that mean the CIA was an entire
[2:57:01.060 --> 2:57:07.060]  clandestine army operation during the Cold War and of course it took advantage
[2:57:07.060 --> 2:57:13.060]  vote was doing of course it became a mafia and of itself but the fetishizing
[2:57:13.060 --> 2:57:18.860]  it like it's magical and powerful is just a joke the people are powerful you
[2:57:18.860 --> 2:57:23.860]  are powerful your action your speech what you do how you decide to spend your

[3:01:30.300 --> 3:01:35.660]  good is that we love you brother what's on your mind so I wanted to just give you
[3:01:35.660 --> 3:01:39.460]  some strength and talk about some things I I got my tree of liberty coin last
[3:01:39.460 --> 3:01:43.660]  week and I immediately handed it to my son and I said put that in your pocket
[3:01:43.660 --> 3:01:49.380]  carry that around this is those words on there have never rang more true for what
[3:01:49.380 --> 3:01:54.860]  we need let me tell you in the modern age the third of the series has come out
[3:01:54.860 --> 3:02:01.620]  it's over in the modern age you could not have a bigger piece of Americana than
[3:02:01.620 --> 3:02:05.140]  that founding member coin if it wasn't for the last two coins we would already
[3:02:05.140 --> 3:02:09.700]  be shut down it is you getting that coin brother that kept you that has kept us
[3:02:09.700 --> 3:02:14.260]  on there so I thank you it means a lot and every day that I get up you're still
[3:02:14.260 --> 3:02:18.500]  on the air that's a victory as far as I'm concerned and and so I'm gonna rail a
[3:02:18.500 --> 3:02:23.100]  little bit on on you know the people I know I'm as the saying goes you're
[3:02:23.100 --> 3:02:26.780]  preaching to the choir right we're all in we're all in this together on info
[3:02:26.780 --> 3:02:30.220]  wars we all listen to each other we all support each other but there's a whole
[3:02:30.220 --> 3:02:34.380]  another world out there there's a bunch of people on this Titanic that don't
[3:02:34.380 --> 3:02:38.460]  think that we're taking on water they're clueless and as much as you try to get
[3:02:38.460 --> 3:02:44.380]  through to them you just don't so it seems to me that we're out of phase where
[3:02:44.380 --> 3:02:49.620]  we have to accept what's going on not accept like put up with it but I'm
[3:02:49.620 --> 3:02:55.420]  saying except for a lot of trouble and make preparations we're headed for you
[3:02:55.420 --> 3:03:00.780]  know we're headed for it and the and the leaders will emerge and I'm thankful
[3:03:00.780 --> 3:03:04.020]  that you're one of those leaders yet I think of you I think you earn a shackleton
[3:03:04.020 --> 3:03:07.460]  you know they endure it which is a great book for anybody that hasn't read it
[3:03:07.460 --> 3:03:12.620]  don't don't watch the movie read the book about the endurance and told the
[3:03:12.620 --> 3:03:17.180]  visit to the North Pole yeah yeah when they got locked in the ice and it was
[3:03:17.180 --> 3:03:20.700]  crazy as that was like a hundred and ten years ago look how far we've come so
[3:03:20.700 --> 3:03:25.460]  soon isn't that isn't that something though but you know that the real
[3:03:25.460 --> 3:03:30.100]  leaders emerge and things things will things will be okay and so they'll be
[3:03:30.100 --> 3:03:33.260]  different they'll be different for sure so I just thought maybe I'd get a
[3:03:33.260 --> 3:03:36.180]  chuckle out of you I'd talk to you and tell you that I was in the store and I
[3:03:36.180 --> 3:03:41.380]  this whole thing with the the lips of the lips of tick tock and all the
[3:03:41.380 --> 3:03:45.060]  silliness you know I was thinking to myself as those in the storage you
[3:03:45.060 --> 3:03:48.900]  know you see these you see these little kids every once in a while ripping stuff
[3:03:48.900 --> 3:03:53.100]  off the shelves having a tantrum and fill their parents let them get what
[3:03:53.100 --> 3:03:56.900]  they want those are the people we're dealing with now those people grew up
[3:03:56.900 --> 3:04:02.020]  the moms that let the kids get away with ripping stuff off the shelves and
[3:04:02.020 --> 3:04:06.340]  having a temper tantrum we're dealing with them now this is this is who they
[3:04:06.340 --> 3:04:09.460]  are I don't I don't think we're gonna heal them I don't think we're gonna get

[3:06:01.500 --> 3:06:05.300]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm Kate Daly your guest host from Kate
[3:06:05.300 --> 3:06:09.740]  Daly radio.com so glad to be here today I hope you're having a great one I have
[3:06:09.740 --> 3:06:13.900]  got such a special guest for you that I want to get right to him this is college
[3:06:13.900 --> 3:06:19.300]  professor David Clements I he was from New Mexico State University up until
[3:06:19.300 --> 3:06:24.700]  recently when he was fired and he was an advocate for the audits for the 2020
[3:06:24.700 --> 3:06:28.380]  presidential election many many articles about him I know you've read about him
[3:06:28.380 --> 3:06:34.420]  and of course he makes a fantastic presentation on the election fraud and I
[3:06:34.420 --> 3:06:38.740]  can't imagine a better time to talk about this as everything is kind of
[3:06:38.740 --> 3:06:43.820]  everybody thinks everything is hinging on the 2022 midterms I have a lot of
[3:06:43.820 --> 3:06:47.260]  thoughts about that but I will get back to that as I think both parties are one
[3:06:47.260 --> 3:06:52.180]  but claiming he was claiming widespread election fraud we all know there was
[3:06:52.180 --> 3:06:57.620]  fraud and professor Clements was fired from his position even after winning one
[3:06:57.620 --> 3:07:02.300]  of the highest honors as a professor he refused to wear a mask to pick up this
[3:07:02.300 --> 3:07:06.540]  award. Professor David Clements welcome and I love your courage your
[3:07:06.540 --> 3:07:13.420]  determination to bringing attention to election fraud thanks for joining me hi
[3:07:13.420 --> 3:07:19.740]  Kate it's good to be with you. You too so talk to me about your initial what you
[3:07:19.740 --> 3:07:24.300]  were realizing initially when you were looking at the election and you were not
[3:07:24.300 --> 3:07:29.860]  a fan of Trump you were not in his corner you you noticed things on January
[3:07:29.860 --> 3:07:34.660]  6th what happened and of course then before then in November tell us a little
[3:07:34.660 --> 3:07:43.260]  bit about that journey for you. Well I would say that I was a I think 2016 I
[3:07:43.260 --> 3:07:49.780]  would say I was a never-trumper I didn't know much about him and over the next
[3:07:49.780 --> 3:07:57.020]  four years I begrudgingly became an admirer and by the time 2020 came around
[3:07:57.020 --> 3:08:03.420]  I actually did vote for him and I was proud to do so and so my journey though
[3:08:03.420 --> 3:08:07.060]  with respect to the elections and fraud though was just like everyone else so
[3:08:07.060 --> 3:08:11.940]  November 3rd things look like it was going to be an overwhelming victory for
[3:08:11.940 --> 3:08:17.780]  Trump and then the next morning you had just this narrative that was formulated
[3:08:17.780 --> 3:08:22.260]  at a whole cloth that this was the safest the most secure election in history
[3:08:22.260 --> 3:08:27.460]  and I was still a business law professor at the time so I started looking at the
[3:08:27.460 --> 3:08:32.340]  evidence there were a lot of claims that there was no evidence and I thought
[3:08:32.340 --> 3:08:37.100]  that was odd because I started looking at the court logs and was looking to see if
[3:08:37.100 --> 3:08:42.500]  evidentiary hearings were actually set and at the time I reviewed upwards of 56
[3:08:42.500 --> 3:08:47.380]  significant election fraud cases and I found out that by and large there weren't
[3:08:47.380 --> 3:08:50.340]  any evidentiary hearings set so how can you say there's no evidence if you're
[3:08:50.340 --> 3:08:57.620]  not going to provide a forum to hear witnesses testify so my curiosity was
[3:08:57.620 --> 3:09:02.020]  piqued and so I think I was the first person with my credentials former
[3:09:02.020 --> 3:09:07.780]  prosecutor expert in evidence presentation and law professor to say this
[3:09:07.780 --> 3:09:12.660]  narrative that there's no evidence is absolutely bogus because I started
[3:09:12.660 --> 3:09:16.900]  reviewing the expert reports and I started looking at the affidavits thousands
[3:09:16.900 --> 3:09:22.020]  of affidavits and there was a ton of evidence you had eight-hour public
[3:09:22.020 --> 3:09:28.340]  hearings in Arizona and Pennsylvania in Michigan in Georgia so I could not
[3:09:28.340 --> 3:09:32.300]  reconcile what I was getting from the media from what I was actually seeing in
[3:09:32.300 --> 3:09:37.540]  the court filings and so that that was the beginning of my my journey and at
[3:09:37.540 --> 3:09:43.980]  some point I basically become an expert along the way incredible I'm you know in
[3:09:43.980 --> 3:09:48.380]  the very very beginning to me it was so obvious because Biden couldn't even get
[3:09:48.380 --> 3:09:53.700]  16% of the vote from his own party they load him so much he was such a joke in
[3:09:53.700 --> 3:09:58.860]  the arena of politics after you know this 45 year career of demolishing liberty
[3:09:58.860 --> 3:10:02.260]  so it was interesting that there were so many people that were so shocked and
[3:10:02.260 --> 3:10:06.740]  that was your initial shock right because there was no way looking at that
[3:10:06.740 --> 3:10:09.700]  whole year before coming up to the election because a lot of liberals are
[3:10:09.700 --> 3:10:13.860]  so shocked that were that we claim election fraud even though like you
[3:10:13.860 --> 3:10:18.860]  said there's so much evidence but even just for the obvious just for the pure
[3:10:18.860 --> 3:10:23.620]  obvious it was pretty obvious coming up to the election who was going to be the
[3:10:23.620 --> 3:10:28.300]  winner of that so even on just the obvious terms alone some sort of
[3:10:28.300 --> 3:10:33.140]  investigation really should have happened and I haven't seen it happen at
[3:10:33.140 --> 3:10:38.260]  all or be be quickly dismissed so so what happened after that you started
[3:10:38.260 --> 3:10:44.380]  speaking out publicly well yeah and I into your point just want to say that
[3:10:44.380 --> 3:10:47.820]  most political consultants would tell you that the most reliable predictor
[3:10:47.820 --> 3:10:52.700]  electoral success is voter enthusiasm and people were wildly
[3:10:52.700 --> 3:10:57.380]  enthusiastic about Trump you still see it now with 80,000 plus people showing
[3:10:57.380 --> 3:11:02.300]  up and with Biden it was it was non-existent and we're right we were
[3:11:02.300 --> 3:11:08.020]  told that this guy's more popular than Barack Obama 81 million votes from a
[3:11:08.020 --> 3:11:13.940]  guy that yeah right out of his basement so it's bizarre and I think that was
[3:11:13.940 --> 3:11:17.780]  what was so shocking I think it would have been more palatable if you had a
[3:11:17.780 --> 3:11:21.980]  more charismatic candidate but with Biden it was like we can't we just can't
[3:11:21.980 --> 3:11:28.620]  reconcile these figures with this guy who can't put together a sentence but to
[3:11:28.620 --> 3:11:36.500]  your question I basically went from reporting on lawsuits until there was a
[3:11:36.500 --> 3:11:41.300]  point in time in which the Supreme Court was basically not hearing cases and
[3:11:41.300 --> 3:11:46.540]  most of the cases were dismissed on standing for legal process grounds and
[3:11:46.540 --> 3:11:51.460]  so at that point I just started trying to find experts expert mathematicians
[3:11:51.460 --> 3:11:58.180]  witnesses people that actually filed the lawsuits attorneys some cyber experts
[3:11:58.180 --> 3:12:04.860]  and I tried to present their story in a way that I would have done at trial you
[3:12:04.860 --> 3:12:08.300]  know you do a direct examination and so these were long-form interviews and by
[3:12:08.300 --> 3:12:12.500]  the time we got around to Michael and Dell cyber symposium I had pretty much
[3:12:12.500 --> 3:12:18.420]  interviewed almost every significant name that was in the fight trying to
[3:12:18.420 --> 3:12:23.340]  shine a light on the truth and basically what we saw was a massive
[3:12:23.340 --> 3:12:26.740]  deviation under the law states weren't following their own state
[3:12:26.740 --> 3:12:32.020]  constitutions we saw massive deviations under mathematics statistical anomalies
[3:12:32.020 --> 3:12:37.500]  that you just cannot it just it doesn't make sense and I'll give you one example
[3:12:37.500 --> 3:12:41.580]  in particular because the machines right now are starting to tell on themselves
[3:12:41.580 --> 3:12:46.100]  there's a thing called the law of large numbers and most pollsters know what this
[3:12:46.100 --> 3:12:52.140]  is you don't have to survey every single person in a city or in the country to get
[3:12:52.140 --> 3:12:56.500]  a sense of how the country feels or the county feels at some point you'll see
[3:12:56.500 --> 3:13:00.780]  some variability and then it will normalize and what we're finding is with
[3:13:00.780 --> 3:13:04.660]  these cast vote records that you can actually get from the machine providers
[3:13:04.660 --> 3:13:11.100]  if you're lucky you're seeing a major linear spike that's traveling to a set
[3:13:11.100 --> 3:13:16.180]  point and that's indicative of machine driven fraud and we're finding it
[3:13:16.180 --> 3:13:20.700]  everywhere so you would expect with this cast cast vote record which is
[3:13:20.700 --> 3:13:24.340]  basically the order in which someone shows up at the polling place to cast
[3:13:24.340 --> 3:13:28.860]  their vote so the only way that a linear spike would make any sense is if you
[3:13:28.860 --> 3:13:34.500]  just happen to have six or seven thousand Biden voters lining up in a row at
[3:13:34.500 --> 3:13:39.380]  the voting center we know intuitively that's not going to happen so we've
[3:13:39.380 --> 3:13:44.220]  gotten over a dozen of these cast vote records across the country and we're
[3:13:44.220 --> 3:13:49.220]  finding this set point it's just fighting to get to a predetermined outcome
[3:13:49.220 --> 3:13:54.020]  which just happened to favor Biden so when you see stuff like that where the
[3:13:54.020 --> 3:13:57.820]  machines are telling on themselves when you listen to the analysis of Draza
[3:13:57.820 --> 3:14:03.820]  Smith or Dr. Doug Frank there's just so many pieces of evidence that corroborate
[3:14:03.820 --> 3:14:08.940]  one another and you're left with this this question of why do we trust these
[3:14:08.940 --> 3:14:15.660]  machines exactly right in fact I I know we have just a like a minute left before
[3:14:15.660 --> 3:14:21.420]  we go to a break but you likened this in your presentation to a to the drug war
[3:14:21.420 --> 3:14:26.580]  and how the drug war has has swept you know not war because anytime we put a
[3:14:26.580 --> 3:14:31.660]  war on anything and it could it expands quite ironically but how the drug lords
[3:14:31.660 --> 3:14:35.140]  operate how they operate with drugs throughout this country because you've
[3:14:35.140 --> 3:14:42.340]  had particular experience with us yeah well I've I've gotten I've secured at
[3:14:42.340 --> 3:14:45.780]  least eight first-degree murder convictions and help take down a drug
[3:14:45.780 --> 3:14:50.860]  trafficking organization and so one of the reasons why I think I see clearly in
[3:14:50.860 --> 3:14:56.260]  a way that most put most folks don't is that vote trafficking works the same way
[3:14:56.260 --> 3:15:00.420]  as drug trafficking you have the drug cartels but then you have drug trafficking
[3:15:00.420 --> 3:15:05.380]  organizations that are in regional areas and they work to traffic their product
[3:15:05.380 --> 3:15:09.420]  and what we're finding here is that you have an election cartel and you've got
[3:15:09.420 --> 3:15:13.300]  vote trafficking centers in different counties that are strategically placed
[3:15:13.300 --> 3:15:17.340]  where your votes go missing they're concealed they're shuffled they're
[3:15:17.340 --> 3:15:24.380]  switched it's the same methods that we see in the drug wars but in some respects
[3:15:24.380 --> 3:15:27.380]  I would say that this is vastly more important because these are our voices
[3:15:27.380 --> 3:15:31.580]  and if you don't have the rule of law or your voice then we're in big trouble on
[3:15:31.580 --> 3:15:36.780]  every other issue absolutely they're hijacking they're hijacking us in this
[3:15:36.780 --> 3:15:41.820]  process and we and we're definitely cued our nation in the White House this
[3:15:41.820 --> 3:15:46.140]  last go around this last election I'm gonna come right back with Professor
[3:15:46.140 --> 3:15:49.100]  David Clements because you're gonna want to hear how this works how are they
[3:15:49.100 --> 3:15:53.340]  doing this and this was my big question for Professor Clements how are they
[3:15:53.340 --> 3:15:57.540]  doing this I'll be right back I'm Kate Dally your guest the powerful
[3:15:57.540 --> 3:16:02.380]  combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a

[3:16:23.860 --> 3:16:27.860]  chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health
[3:16:27.860 --> 3:16:31.860]  conditions including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain
[3:16:31.860 --> 3:16:36.380]  after surgery studies have shown as for vitamin C and zinc themselves you
[3:16:36.380 --> 3:16:40.300]  probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition immune
[3:16:40.300 --> 3:16:44.100]  defense and the maintenance of your everyday health it has been reported
[3:16:44.100 --> 3:16:48.540]  that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations like

[3:20:10.780 --> 3:20:14.700]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show and Kate Dally your guest host I have such
[3:20:14.700 --> 3:20:19.220]  a great guest for you a professor David Clements and I have had some very long
[3:20:19.220 --> 3:20:23.540]  conversations about election fraud and I really want you to listen to what he has
[3:20:23.540 --> 3:20:28.540]  to say he made a wonderful presentation at Mike Lindell symposium and let me
[3:20:28.540 --> 3:20:33.780]  tell you our election fraud our elections have been hijacked and he
[3:20:33.780 --> 3:20:40.780]  understands drug trafficking very very well after being in the courtroom with
[3:20:40.780 --> 3:20:45.660]  many cases and drug trafficking and so you are aligning drug trafficking to
[3:20:45.660 --> 3:20:49.540]  election fraud and I can't wait to get more on this from you and then we'll
[3:20:49.540 --> 3:20:53.820]  talk about what people can do in their own communities right now because as we
[3:20:53.820 --> 3:20:58.140]  come closer to 2022 everybody's talking about the red wave the red wave isn't
[3:20:58.140 --> 3:21:02.460]  gonna do anything unless I nor do I I don't know what's gonna happen but I
[3:21:02.460 --> 3:21:05.540]  don't have a lot of faith in the red wave either because I don't think they're
[3:21:05.540 --> 3:21:10.380]  going to do anything once in power but with that being said tell me a little
[3:21:10.380 --> 3:21:14.820]  bit more about drug trafficking aligning itself sort of how election fraud works
[3:21:14.820 --> 3:21:20.860]  in this country yeah well any case that you try you have to understand that you've
[3:21:20.860 --> 3:21:25.500]  got bad guys that want to get away with the crime and that means you conceal
[3:21:25.500 --> 3:21:30.140]  evidence you destroy evidence you intimidate witnesses you launder money
[3:21:30.140 --> 3:21:35.540]  you you do whatever you can to to ensure that the survival of your
[3:21:35.540 --> 3:21:41.140]  organization continues and so in the drug business you do whatever you can to
[3:21:41.140 --> 3:21:44.580]  protect the flow of drugs so you can make money and if that means you have to
[3:21:44.580 --> 3:21:50.140]  burn bodies or burn vehicles that happens in the election context when
[3:21:50.140 --> 3:21:54.300]  you're talking about vote trafficking same concept here you're looking at
[3:21:54.300 --> 3:21:59.780]  machines that are intentionally designed to be vulnerable you've got all kinds of
[3:21:59.780 --> 3:22:03.700]  tools that are in these machines and we we're not guessing about this we have
[3:22:03.700 --> 3:22:07.460]  expert reports about 20 of them actually came out of Michigan in Matt
[3:22:07.460 --> 3:22:13.220]  DePernos case where you have features within the existing hardware and
[3:22:13.220 --> 3:22:19.180]  software that allows you to switch votes to shuffle votes and then we're seeing
[3:22:19.180 --> 3:22:26.060]  the algorithms that are clearly being deployed here so these are things that
[3:22:26.060 --> 3:22:30.140]  you've got a bunch of smoke and mirrors it's hard to see what's going on unless
[3:22:30.140 --> 3:22:34.100]  you have the technical background but we've consulted with technical experts
[3:22:34.100 --> 3:22:38.860]  and they understand that these machines have massive vulnerabilities and when I
[3:22:38.860 --> 3:22:42.620]  say machines you got different types of machines you have the e-poll books when
[3:22:42.620 --> 3:22:46.700]  you come in and check in well those poll books are hooked to the Internet so you
[3:22:46.700 --> 3:22:51.300]  have access right there from hackers you can also take a tally who shows up
[3:22:51.300 --> 3:22:56.140]  once you've signed in to get your ballot well if you're signing in and your
[3:22:56.140 --> 3:23:00.020]  president accounted for the enemy if they want to subvert your elections has
[3:23:00.020 --> 3:23:04.620]  an entire list of folks that haven't shown up so the bad guy's gonna want to
[3:23:04.620 --> 3:23:09.700]  find a home for those that didn't show up and cast a vote for them the e-poll
[3:23:09.700 --> 3:23:15.900]  books provide information that creates tremendous vulnerability and this is on
[3:23:15.900 --> 3:23:20.340]  my mind a lot because right now many of us have seen the trailer for Dinesh
[3:23:20.340 --> 3:23:25.220]  D'Souza's next film 2000 mules where we've got all kinds of people that are
[3:23:25.220 --> 3:23:30.380]  vote traffickers ballot mules showing up to ballot boxes and stuffing those
[3:23:30.380 --> 3:23:35.580]  ballot boxes so that's very reminiscent of the drug world as well and then you've
[3:23:35.580 --> 3:23:39.140]  got the next vulnerability which is these tabulators themselves we've been
[3:23:39.140 --> 3:23:45.460]  told sworn sworn sworn to by John Paulus of Dominion that these machines do not
[3:23:45.460 --> 3:23:48.820]  hook up to the Internet well then you look at video evidence for from his
[3:23:48.820 --> 3:23:52.940]  vice president Eric Kummer where he talks about just how accessible these
[3:23:52.940 --> 3:23:57.140]  tabulators are to be hooked to the Internet and we're finding actual chip
[3:23:57.140 --> 3:24:01.980]  modems attached to the hardware themselves so you have massive
[3:24:01.980 --> 3:24:06.820]  vulnerabilities there and even if you want to give Dominion the benefit of the
[3:24:06.820 --> 3:24:11.180]  doubt once you upload the information from these tabulators into an election
[3:24:11.180 --> 3:24:16.540]  management system those systems are networked so when you start transferring
[3:24:16.540 --> 3:24:22.100]  election day results to sidle or to Edison and that's what we usually see
[3:24:22.100 --> 3:24:26.900]  on CNN or Fox when you have the the updates with the vote that's networked
[3:24:26.900 --> 3:24:31.740]  so there are so many massive points where a hacker or a black hat could attack
[3:24:31.740 --> 3:24:35.420]  and subvert and so all the evidence that we're seeing where you have people
[3:24:35.420 --> 3:24:41.100]  telling or being told go home on election night we see massive flips 40,000
[3:24:41.100 --> 3:24:47.140]  being shifted from by a from Trump to Biden we saw 400,000 votes disappear in
[3:24:47.140 --> 3:24:53.140]  the Gavin Newsom recall election I mean there's so many examples of vote flipping
[3:24:53.140 --> 3:24:59.860]  vote drops vote shuffling that it's clear to me that you've got a method or a
[3:24:59.860 --> 3:25:04.700]  scheme here that's concealing the truth and in the process our voice is being
[3:25:04.700 --> 3:25:10.500]  stolen absolutely even in my own state they we uncovered two moms actually went
[3:25:10.500 --> 3:25:16.300]  after some information and uncovered with a software analysis that 250,000
[3:25:16.300 --> 3:25:21.020]  votes were switched from in person to absentee overnight and there was so much
[3:25:21.020 --> 3:25:25.260]  fraud even in my own state people need to look at their own states and start
[3:25:25.260 --> 3:25:30.780]  doing a request for information because I'm telling you it's so widespread and
[3:25:30.780 --> 3:25:36.060]  the states really took this on do you think President Trump knew or had had
[3:25:36.060 --> 3:25:39.580]  knowledge about all of the things you're talking about some of the things
[3:25:39.580 --> 3:25:45.900]  you're talking about beforehand to do anything about this before he was banned
[3:25:45.900 --> 3:25:50.220]  from Twitter he was more or less telegraphing exactly what was going to
[3:25:50.220 --> 3:25:54.260]  happen so there was a series of tweets leading up and he talked about the
[3:25:54.260 --> 3:26:00.340]  vulnerabilities of mail-in ballots of using the COVID hoax as a pretext to
[3:26:00.340 --> 3:26:06.420]  weaken our safeguards to you know make it where anyone can vote as an absentee
[3:26:06.420 --> 3:26:10.500]  voter and so when you start shifting the primary way primary way of how we
[3:26:10.500 --> 3:26:16.780]  usually vote in person to longer periods of time to mail-in voting to absentee
[3:26:16.780 --> 3:26:20.580]  voting you're creating an environment where there's there's a greater
[3:26:20.580 --> 3:26:25.020]  propensity for fraud and so Trump warned us warned us of that so it seems to
[3:26:25.020 --> 3:26:30.660]  suggest to me that he was prepared for what happened and I know that we're all
[3:26:30.660 --> 3:26:34.900]  trying to make sense of just how much he knew but he certainly showcased that he
[3:26:34.900 --> 3:26:39.580]  had his finger on the pulse well in advance of November 3rd 2020
[3:26:39.580 --> 3:26:43.980]  yeah absolutely and there's a mountain of evidence and I think you're taught
[3:26:43.980 --> 3:26:46.660]  you're you're you're letting people know and you're speaking all over the
[3:26:46.660 --> 3:26:50.180]  country and you're saying there is so much evidence you cannot ignore it
[3:26:50.180 --> 3:26:56.740]  anymore it's a mountain never ending yeah and it's you know it's one of those
[3:26:56.740 --> 3:27:00.180]  things even if you've got politicians that are self-serving or county clerks
[3:27:00.180 --> 3:27:02.940]  that are scared that somehow this will suggest that they've done something
[3:27:02.940 --> 3:27:07.060]  wrong I believe that the cheat in the way that's deployed really can be done
[3:27:07.060 --> 3:27:10.380]  without the knowledge of the county clerks because you're looking about you're
[3:27:10.380 --> 3:27:14.260]  looking at aspects of software manipulation within the machines and
[3:27:14.260 --> 3:27:19.860]  purposely vulnerable hardware and they don't control that your county clerks
[3:27:19.860 --> 3:27:24.860]  aren't running the machines they've got tech experts that are being provided by
[3:27:24.860 --> 3:27:30.460]  Dominion or yes and s and they have no understanding of how those machines work
[3:27:30.460 --> 3:27:34.620]  they simply regurgitate the talking points that are provided by Dominion and
[3:27:34.620 --> 3:27:39.220]  as soon as we have access to those machines and we show them there's a
[3:27:39.220 --> 3:27:44.300]  moment in which they start having those doubts and where they open up access to
[3:27:44.300 --> 3:27:48.460]  the machines we're confirming that what we're saying right now is absolutely
[3:27:48.460 --> 3:27:54.340]  correct well I wonder if it's anything like my state where the governor sent
[3:27:54.340 --> 3:27:58.260]  off our machines overnight to Maricopa County of all places to get rid of them
[3:27:58.260 --> 3:28:02.620]  so and they're supposed to by law keep them for 60 days and I wonder how much
[3:28:02.620 --> 3:28:07.580]  of that was going on in the country how many governors how many people all the
[3:28:07.580 --> 3:28:12.420]  way down the food chain were part of this and there are many many cogs in the
[3:28:12.420 --> 3:28:16.900]  wheel I think many people have do their little piece and think that it's not
[3:28:16.900 --> 3:28:20.020]  going to affect an entire election but you have enough of that you have enough
[3:28:20.020 --> 3:28:23.740]  cogs in the wheel yes it will affect our elections and there were a lot of
[3:28:23.740 --> 3:28:28.660]  people getting paychecks taking selfies of tampering so that they could get
[3:28:28.660 --> 3:28:33.460]  their paycheck and and there are many many people who do something they think
[3:28:33.460 --> 3:28:39.620]  is small and ends up being extremely a big on the on the big on the election
[3:28:39.620 --> 3:28:43.140]  itself on all of the federal elections and and everything else I'll be right
[3:28:43.140 --> 3:28:47.140]  back with professor David Clemens what can we do about it this is the most
[3:28:47.140 --> 3:28:51.180]  important question is it not what can we do about it as citizens because I know
[3:28:51.180 --> 3:28:55.340]  you're frustrated and I know that coming up to vote it's gonna get it's gonna get
[3:28:55.340 --> 3:28:59.060]  messy in 20 you know it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it it's just
[3:28:59.060 --> 3:29:04.260]  true that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human
[3:29:04.260 --> 3:29:11.100]  liberty as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist
[3:29:11.100 --> 3:29:17.220]  anti-human program and man our work is really right now hitting the most

[3:32:00.660 --> 3:32:04.780]  couple years but I only had money to finance my own simple little local
[3:32:04.780 --> 3:32:08.180]  radio show I wanted to hire camera people I wanted to make films I wanted to
[3:32:08.180 --> 3:32:12.140]  really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt I designed the first one
[3:32:12.140 --> 3:32:17.500]  mass murderers agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first
[3:32:17.500 --> 3:32:21.740]  two members of my crew that's our oldest design and we still sell it we have that
[3:32:21.740 --> 3:32:25.860]  design over a hundred others that will now all be limited issues because

[3:32:57.260 --> 3:33:06.420]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[3:33:11.300 --> 3:33:15.140]  back here with you I'm Kate Deli your guest host on the Alex Jones show today
[3:33:15.140 --> 3:33:19.100]  hope you're having a great day I brought professor David Clemens on with me
[3:33:19.100 --> 3:33:23.260]  because I really want people to understand that there there are things
[3:33:23.260 --> 3:33:28.460]  that you can do you're not we're I know we feel like because they have the
[3:33:28.460 --> 3:33:34.820]  microphone this 30% of the country they have the media the microphone and the
[3:33:34.820 --> 3:33:40.140]  government that they can that they can basically try to teach us that we can't
[3:33:40.140 --> 3:33:44.380]  do much about it and they've got it all going on that isn't true we have the
[3:33:44.380 --> 3:33:48.620]  power we the people and so professor David Clemens please tell us what we can
[3:33:48.620 --> 3:33:52.780]  do about this as you've looked into all of this evidence and it's monstrous
[3:33:52.780 --> 3:33:58.740]  evidence I mean it's so much tell us what we can do well first you have to
[3:33:58.740 --> 3:34:04.100]  understand that the primary source of the stealing of our voices is the
[3:34:04.100 --> 3:34:07.380]  machines if people you don't hear anything else in this interview it's the
[3:34:07.380 --> 3:34:11.140]  machines it's the machines it's the machines and all the other stuff the
[3:34:11.140 --> 3:34:16.060]  ballot stuffing it's bad having bad laws like voter ID not having to produce it
[3:34:16.060 --> 3:34:20.900]  that's bad but those are manifestations of the cover-up so most of the stuff
[3:34:20.900 --> 3:34:24.740]  that people are going to propose that you need to fix are the front end fixes
[3:34:24.740 --> 3:34:29.700]  that you can see but that's not how the cheats being deployed in the theft of
[3:34:29.700 --> 3:34:34.380]  our voices it's through the machines themselves so beware of this red wave
[3:34:34.380 --> 3:34:37.860]  stuff where you can go out and overwhelm the algorithm or if you have more poll
[3:34:37.860 --> 3:34:41.820]  watchers or if you clean up your voter rolls that somehow you're going to win
[3:34:41.820 --> 3:34:45.900]  because I've got news for you our voter rolls are artificially inflated we have
[3:34:45.900 --> 3:34:50.220]  all kinds of third-party groups massively filling our registration
[3:34:50.220 --> 3:34:55.900]  databases you also have the Eric system that's has ties to George Soros so
[3:34:55.900 --> 3:34:59.820]  there's a lot of busy work that's being given to Republicans and
[3:34:59.820 --> 3:35:05.220]  Conservatives but they're not properly diagnosing the problem so if the
[3:35:05.220 --> 3:35:09.460]  machines are the issue then you need to have a strategy to get rid of them so I've
[3:35:09.460 --> 3:35:12.940]  been advocating for this thing called the county commission strategy where you
[3:35:12.940 --> 3:35:17.500]  get before your county commissioners and these are usually small numbers three to
[3:35:17.500 --> 3:35:21.540]  five commissioners or in some places you have boards of supervisors whoever
[3:35:21.540 --> 3:35:25.460]  certifies your elections at the county level you need to start framing your
[3:35:25.460 --> 3:35:29.820]  argument at these county commission meetings under this no confidence
[3:35:29.820 --> 3:35:33.740]  paradigm you know you don't have to be an expert you don't have to be a professor
[3:35:33.740 --> 3:35:37.900]  you can just tell them during your comp your public comment period usually at
[3:35:37.900 --> 3:35:41.580]  two to three minutes to tell them about your concerns over these machines based
[3:35:41.580 --> 3:35:45.940]  on what we've all learned over the past 18 months and when you have 200 300
[3:35:45.940 --> 3:35:50.020]  people showing up to these meetings each taking the mic talking for two to three
[3:35:50.020 --> 3:35:53.940]  minutes you're going to get the attention of these county commissions and
[3:35:53.940 --> 3:35:59.060]  case in point my county Nevada they had a unanimous vote they brought in some
[3:35:59.060 --> 3:36:02.500]  machine experts to talk about the vulnerabilities to the county commission
[3:36:02.500 --> 3:36:06.500]  they unanimously approved getting rid of the machines they're going to an all
[3:36:06.500 --> 3:36:12.220]  paper-based system with ballots with anti counterfeit measures hand tabulated
[3:36:12.220 --> 3:36:17.620]  and they've got a promising future in I County last night I learned that Esmeralda
[3:36:17.620 --> 3:36:22.300]  County in Nevada had a unanimous decision three to zero getting rid of the
[3:36:22.300 --> 3:36:26.380]  machines Rio Blanca Colorado was a two-to-one decision to get rid of the
[3:36:26.380 --> 3:36:29.820]  machines in Otero County in New Mexico we're going to try to advocate for the
[3:36:29.820 --> 3:36:34.900]  same thing where we have an audit that's underway so if you frame things in the
[3:36:34.900 --> 3:36:40.180]  sense of look we're the sovereigns we the people are the government why are we
[3:36:40.180 --> 3:36:45.660]  trying to convince people to let us have more accuracy in the way that we vote
[3:36:45.660 --> 3:36:51.180]  demanded either these commissioners work for you or they don't I suggest that
[3:36:51.180 --> 3:36:54.660]  they do their public servants and so we've got something here that's a little
[3:36:54.660 --> 3:36:59.580]  bit more practical I think everyone wanted Maricopa County to just be the
[3:36:59.580 --> 3:37:03.700]  domino that fell myself included and we were all just gonna follow suit and while
[3:37:03.700 --> 3:37:07.900]  that happened the clock was being run out and we weren't focusing on our own
[3:37:07.900 --> 3:37:12.820]  backyards so these are these are this is a promising strategy for many reasons
[3:37:12.820 --> 3:37:16.380]  one you're not you're not relying on a corrupt judiciary or a judge that's
[3:37:16.380 --> 3:37:19.780]  going to see the world that you do to you don't have to get an entire state
[3:37:19.780 --> 3:37:23.860]  legislature Republican or otherwise you can go to rural counties and in your
[3:37:23.860 --> 3:37:27.220]  county say we're not doing it this way anymore so if you get rid of the
[3:37:27.220 --> 3:37:32.260]  machines think about this in in the near future the judge that you voted for the
[3:37:32.260 --> 3:37:37.660]  sheriff that you voted for your state reps they're actually someone that you
[3:37:37.660 --> 3:37:42.020]  cast a vote for because right now we're not voting all the people are saying
[3:37:42.020 --> 3:37:45.460]  that let's get out there and overwhelm the algorithm you're submitting a
[3:37:45.460 --> 3:37:51.300]  fractionalized manipulated data point so you know the clearest examples if
[3:37:51.300 --> 3:37:57.220]  Trump came out with 80 million votes the bad guys will find 81 million votes for
[3:37:57.220 --> 3:38:01.500]  Biden and the reason why we know this is that the real president isn't in the
[3:38:01.500 --> 3:38:05.780]  White House right now is the reason why we know this is in the the election the
[3:38:05.780 --> 3:38:09.220]  runoff election in Georgia Republicans didn't win the reason why we know this
[3:38:09.220 --> 3:38:12.860]  is that Gavin Newsom even though there was upwards of two million signatures to
[3:38:12.860 --> 3:38:19.300]  recall him 40% were Democrats he looks smug as a bug and he survived the recall
[3:38:19.300 --> 3:38:25.100]  election so how many of these examples do we need to provide before we realize
[3:38:25.100 --> 3:38:32.060]  that unless we get rid of the machines we don't have a future 100% I love your
[3:38:32.060 --> 3:38:35.580]  points because this can be done this it can actually be done you can actually
[3:38:35.580 --> 3:38:38.980]  show up at your county commission meetings and it's something small that we
[3:38:38.980 --> 3:38:43.060]  can all do but once they start to hear an overwhelming response from the
[3:38:43.060 --> 3:38:48.140]  community that you do not trust your own elections going back to hand to hand
[3:38:48.140 --> 3:38:52.340]  ballots this is not a big deal I know the left right now the left is trying to
[3:38:52.340 --> 3:38:58.260]  portray it as we're against poor people and people of color I don't I don't even
[3:38:58.260 --> 3:39:02.460]  I don't even know how to explain their strategy on that and that we're trying
[3:39:02.460 --> 3:39:06.740]  to curb the vote no we're trying to go back to a vote that is very transparent
[3:39:06.740 --> 3:39:11.340]  and it seems to me that even both parties were all aboard this train of
[3:39:11.340 --> 3:39:17.060]  mail-in voting well my son got a ballot at the age of 16 because of his driver's
[3:39:17.060 --> 3:39:21.860]  license so you could imagine how many mail-in ballots are getting getting
[3:39:21.860 --> 3:39:25.780]  sent to the wrong addresses and getting sent to and not even talking about the
[3:39:25.780 --> 3:39:28.940]  machines I'm talking about all the vulnerability points that you that you
[3:39:28.940 --> 3:39:33.020]  pointed out as well but the number one thing the number one vulnerability is
[3:39:33.020 --> 3:39:37.380]  the machines so that's where we have to go to the heart of it and say look we
[3:39:37.380 --> 3:39:43.460]  are not we are going to demand hand counting in our county period right yes
[3:39:43.460 --> 3:39:46.740]  well and there's lots of things that we can do but we have to prioritize like
[3:39:46.740 --> 3:39:50.660]  you know if you go to an emergency room you think of triage if there's a person
[3:39:50.660 --> 3:39:53.860]  with a fever and someone that's missing an arm you treat the person that missing
[3:39:53.860 --> 3:39:58.460]  that's missing an arm so do we get rid of ballot boxes that were funded by
[3:39:58.460 --> 3:40:04.100]  Zuckerberg absolutely do we get rid of do we clean up our voter rolls to the
[3:40:04.100 --> 3:40:08.380]  extent that we can and it's not machine manipulated absolutely do we have more
[3:40:08.380 --> 3:40:13.340]  poll workers but you have to keep in mind we had robust regulations in place
[3:40:13.340 --> 3:40:19.260]  under black-letter law and they were all uniformly ignored under the COVID pretext
[3:40:19.260 --> 3:40:24.300]  so instead of following state law we had a executive orders that were issued by
[3:40:24.300 --> 3:40:29.340]  the Department of Health or by your governor saying we're not gonna follow
[3:40:29.340 --> 3:40:33.420]  the normal statutory framework on how we vote so that's where you saw the
[3:40:33.420 --> 3:40:37.780]  phenomenon of Stacey Abrams in Georgia just making stuff up and everyone just
[3:40:37.780 --> 3:40:41.620]  through their Constitution in the trash so what makes people think that they
[3:40:41.620 --> 3:40:47.660]  won't do that again even if we have you know fixes to our processes so we have
[3:40:47.660 --> 3:40:52.780]  to start with the triage and the missing limb is the machines and the reason why
[3:40:52.780 --> 3:40:58.420]  I'm so concerned about this red wave nonsense is you know it takes the steam
[3:40:58.420 --> 3:41:04.860]  out of efforts for legitimate reform and and so people were praising the rigged
[3:41:04.860 --> 3:41:09.860]  selection of Glen Yonkin in Virginia you know and he on paper if you don't do too
[3:41:09.860 --> 3:41:13.380]  much research he looks like a guy who's a conservative but he's a member on the
[3:41:13.380 --> 3:41:17.620]  Council for Foreign Relations he's the CEO of the Carlisle Group a globalist
[3:41:17.620 --> 3:41:22.340]  organization for 25 years which is owned by Staple Street Capital which happens
[3:41:22.340 --> 3:41:29.300]  to own Dominion voting so you ask yourself this is just another
[3:41:29.300 --> 3:41:34.260]  iteration of someone that's gonna let you down and you don't have to wait you
[3:41:34.260 --> 3:41:38.180]  just look at who he's aligned himself with over the past three decades and
[3:41:38.180 --> 3:41:43.700]  that's being touted as a Republican victory and so my greatest fear is that
[3:41:43.700 --> 3:41:49.220]  we're gonna have a bunch of Glen Yonkin types that are selected and everyone in
[3:41:49.220 --> 3:41:52.460]  this movement is gonna go look maybe it's not that bad maybe our elections are
[3:41:52.460 --> 3:41:57.540]  just a teensy bit rigged and if we get out there we'll more or less get someone
[3:41:57.540 --> 3:42:02.220]  who's better and Glen Yonkin to his credit rescinded executive orders on the
[3:42:02.220 --> 3:42:06.700]  medical tyranny in Virginia but that was not a big deal because two weeks later
[3:42:06.700 --> 3:42:11.980]  every Democrat did the same exact thing across the country so you know just be
[3:42:11.980 --> 3:42:16.180]  aware if anyone's telling you to wait and hold off and don't focus on the
[3:42:16.180 --> 3:42:22.500]  machines watch out. Amen. Professor David Clemens thank you so much for

[3:44:56.900 --> 3:44:59.900]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand InfoWorst.
[3:44:59.900 --> 3:45:05.900]  I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show.
[3:45:05.900 --> 3:45:09.900]  And I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[3:45:09.900 --> 3:45:14.900]  And it was a t-shirt I designed the first one, Mass Murderers Agreed Gun Control Works,
[3:45:14.900 --> 3:45:18.900]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew.
[3:45:18.900 --> 3:45:20.900]  That's our oldest design and we still sell it.
[3:45:20.900 --> 3:45:24.900]  We have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions,
[3:45:24.900 --> 3:45:29.900]  because whatever stock we've got in, that's it, we're selling everything out.
[3:45:29.900 --> 3:45:33.900]  To fund the operation, to get rid of inventory, we'll still have some t-shirts in the future.
[3:45:33.900 --> 3:45:35.900]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[3:45:35.900 --> 3:45:39.900]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance.
[3:45:39.900 --> 3:45:44.900]  I almost forgot, we're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.

[3:46:56.900 --> 3:47:06.900]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:06.900 --> 3:47:21.900]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Daly, your guest host from KateDalyRadio.com. So good to be with you.
[3:47:21.900 --> 3:47:24.900]  And a big thank you to Professor Clements because he is speaking out. He's so bold. I love his courage in doing this.
[3:47:24.900 --> 3:47:29.900]  And he's getting a lot of eyeballs because of the fact that there is a mountain of evidence.
[3:47:29.900 --> 3:47:33.900]  This isn't a theory. It's evidence. It's different when it's evidence.
[3:47:33.900 --> 3:47:37.900]  Even in my own state, it's evidence. That's huge.
[3:47:37.900 --> 3:47:41.900]  So I want to talk about a couple of things, just reference a couple of things.
[3:47:41.900 --> 3:47:46.900]  I want to talk about King Fraudelot for a second and Obama. I just shuddered when I said that.
[3:47:46.900 --> 3:47:52.900]  And I want to talk a little bit about the snake investigation, the snake theory and the APN elections.
[3:47:52.900 --> 3:47:59.900]  I know it's a lot to cover in just a few minutes, but they really are letting the cat out of the bag with King Fraudelot.
[3:47:59.900 --> 3:48:09.900]  They're making sure that we see footage that makes him look like the moron that he is and the dementia patient that he is, especially at Easter.
[3:48:09.900 --> 3:48:17.900]  And before that, I have reels on Biden. I don't have reels on all of the past presidents, but I do on King Fraudelot.
[3:48:17.900 --> 3:48:23.900]  And so reels of just things said, the corn pop, the this, the that, you know?
[3:48:23.900 --> 3:48:29.900]  And Jill looking at the camera in distress, you know, when he wants to read to the children.
[3:48:29.900 --> 3:48:34.900]  I mean, these are the clips. They're wanting us to see this now. They're not hiding it anymore.
[3:48:34.900 --> 3:48:43.900]  So you know that his removal from society might be soon because of the fact that they're warming us up to the idea that, oh, boy, you know,
[3:48:43.900 --> 3:48:49.900]  he's wandering around stages and shaking hands with air. And this might just might be a problem.
[3:48:49.900 --> 3:48:56.900]  And so, gee, who can we swing into that seat? Well, everybody I know, like me, feels like, oh, no, not Hormala, please.
[3:48:56.900 --> 3:49:02.900]  But with her word salad every five minutes, I have the authority to look at the authority to look at the authority.
[3:49:02.900 --> 3:49:06.900]  She's very strange and smokes a little too much pot.
[3:49:06.900 --> 3:49:12.900]  But anyway, I just wanted to mention that they're softening us up again to the Obamas.
[3:49:12.900 --> 3:49:22.900]  We remember what a train wreck they were the first movie, the first lady movie that just came out of the the Obama on all these TV shows,
[3:49:22.900 --> 3:49:30.900]  the Obama Obama's everywhere. OK, Mr. Third Term, I want to be I want to be in somebody's basement with a microphone Obama.
[3:49:30.900 --> 3:49:35.900]  And so what are they warming us up for? Right? So it kind of makes one wonder.
[3:49:35.900 --> 3:49:38.900]  And but I did want to mention that they do want us to see this.
[3:49:38.900 --> 3:49:44.900]  The other thing I wanted to mention, too, is there was a great piece. If you go to the 10th Amendment Center dot com,
[3:49:44.900 --> 3:49:51.900]  there's a great piece by by by by Rob Natelson called the Electoral Count Act is unconstitutional.
[3:49:51.900 --> 3:49:59.900]  It's really interesting. I am a firm believer and a lover of the Constitution, and I love to understand it better.
[3:49:59.900 --> 3:50:03.900]  And so this is a fantastic piece to understand the Electoral College.
[3:50:03.900 --> 3:50:09.900]  There is a bipartisan group in Congress that is dedicating time to reforming the Electoral Count Act.
[3:50:09.900 --> 3:50:18.900]  And so the Electoral Count Act is a statute purporting to govern how Congress counts electoral votes for president and vice president.
[3:50:18.900 --> 3:50:27.900]  But when you learn what Congress's true role in election in election count, what that basically is, he really does a fantastic piece.
[3:50:27.900 --> 3:50:30.900]  So big hat tip to Rob Natelson on that.
[3:50:30.900 --> 3:50:37.900]  I also last week mentioned the Associated Associated Press, the AP, who you know I totally abhor.
[3:50:37.900 --> 3:50:44.900]  Because they are really they are behind the media and the stories that we get in the media.
[3:50:44.900 --> 3:50:47.900]  They were owned by the Rothschild, still are.
[3:50:47.900 --> 3:50:55.900]  There's two two companies really. Thompson owns Reuters now, who basically they run two separate entities.
[3:50:55.900 --> 3:51:03.900]  And and the AP early on in the mid 1850s was certainly owned by Rothschild's money goes all the way back.
[3:51:03.900 --> 3:51:07.900]  But what's interesting is when I mentioned this, it surprised a lot of people.
[3:51:07.900 --> 3:51:11.900]  Yes, the AP is and this is straight from their website.
[3:51:11.900 --> 3:51:18.900]  The AP is the only organization that collects and verifies election results in every city and county across the United States,
[3:51:18.900 --> 3:51:26.900]  including races for the president, the Senate and the House of Representatives, representatives and governors as well.
[3:51:26.900 --> 3:51:34.900]  Well, they said in their own press release, of course, major news outlets rely on the polling data and results provided by the Associated Press.
[3:51:34.900 --> 3:51:37.900]  What a corrupt organization to be in charge of our elections.
[3:51:37.900 --> 3:51:47.900]  And I said this before, the only reason in 1848 that they started doing the election results was because they said nobody else would do it.
[3:51:47.900 --> 3:51:52.900]  Right. OK, nobody else.
[3:51:52.900 --> 3:52:01.900]  Nobody else wanted to be in charge of of that very, very important event of freedom in the in the new birth of our country 70 years later.
[3:52:01.900 --> 3:52:04.900]  OK, yes, I believe that AP was the only one, right?
[3:52:04.900 --> 3:52:09.900]  But this is what they actually say about themselves and how essential their role in elections is.
[3:52:09.900 --> 3:52:12.900]  And they are the ones that that are over this.
[3:52:12.900 --> 3:52:14.900]  So this was kind of interesting.
[3:52:14.900 --> 3:52:19.900]  They have what's called stringers, stringers for the Associated Press on election night.
[3:52:19.900 --> 3:52:22.900]  This is actually a job description and they hire out for it.
[3:52:22.900 --> 3:52:30.900]  The Associated Press, and this is one of their job descriptions, is seeking reliable people to work as election stringers, more like stingers.
[3:52:30.900 --> 3:52:37.900]  But OK, the night of November 6th in Connecticut, stringers report to an assigned town they call in.
[3:52:37.900 --> 3:52:39.900]  This is from an actual job.
[3:52:39.900 --> 3:52:46.900]  Call in an early vote totals to AP when they're available and they'll basically take any college student that really wants the job.
[3:52:46.900 --> 3:52:52.900]  Oh, nice. You can just be a total moron college student and you get the job of the election stringer.
[3:52:52.900 --> 3:52:57.900]  And these are the ones that go ahead and they talk about or they deliver the results, right?
[3:52:57.900 --> 3:52:59.900]  And they deliver those forward.
[3:52:59.900 --> 3:53:12.900]  And they also talked about the fact that they are over voter registration figures, demographics, results, practices, absentee handling, legislation, voting equipment, candidates, sample ballots.
[3:53:12.900 --> 3:53:15.900]  Boy, they sure have an awful lot to do with our elections.
[3:53:15.900 --> 3:53:21.900]  And they're the media, the corrupt media that hands scripts to everybody in the nation run by our government.
[3:53:21.900 --> 3:53:26.900]  Perfect. Makes me feel warm and cozy, doesn't it?
[3:53:26.900 --> 3:53:34.900]  And so you have to have, there's a few requirements like excellent communication skills and proficiency with MS office skills.
[3:53:34.900 --> 3:53:36.900]  Of course, proficiency with some software.
[3:53:36.900 --> 3:53:51.900]  But what I thought was kind of interesting about this was the fact that they themselves, when they're putting these ads out too, they make it seem like it's just like a no big deal job and you get, you know, 50 bucks with an extra 25 bucks here and there.
[3:53:51.900 --> 3:53:56.900]  But they actually, they actually are over all of the polls.
[3:53:56.900 --> 3:54:08.900]  So when the results from the poll, and this is straight from them, along with our analysis of early voting and other statistics, confirm our expectation that longstanding political trends in the states will hold.
[3:54:08.900 --> 3:54:12.900]  They basically go into the states where the information is available.
[3:54:12.900 --> 3:54:20.900]  And because we don't want to have to wait a couple of months for the results for them to count all the ballots, what they do is they say they go into and they pay close attention
[3:54:20.900 --> 3:54:23.900]  to how many votes have been counted so far, how many are left.
[3:54:23.900 --> 3:54:31.900]  And the voting history of the area, of the area in the past, right, are still being counted.
[3:54:31.900 --> 3:54:34.900]  What they do is they go back and they look at what is the history?
[3:54:34.900 --> 3:54:36.900]  Hmm, can we call a race?
[3:54:36.900 --> 3:54:37.900]  Right.
[3:54:37.900 --> 3:54:39.900]  And they call it very early in the case of 2020.
[3:54:39.900 --> 3:54:46.900]  They went back and they called it extremely early, like when 1% of the vote was in, in Arizona, was it not?
[3:54:46.900 --> 3:54:55.900]  And so what they do is they say we analyze, we analyze the history of the area, we analyze, we analyze, we analyze, and we come up with your result.
[3:54:55.900 --> 3:55:01.900]  And then everybody takes that result, even the candidates themselves, and declare themselves winners or losers.
[3:55:01.900 --> 3:55:04.900]  Do you really want the AP to have this much power?
[3:55:04.900 --> 3:55:06.900]  It's pretty amazing.
[3:55:06.900 --> 3:55:10.900]  They also invented in 2018 what was called AP vote cast.
[3:55:10.900 --> 3:55:12.900]  You might want to look into that.
[3:55:12.900 --> 3:55:14.900]  AP vote cast.
[3:55:14.900 --> 3:55:20.900]  And so basically they look at the party and the candidates' past history of consistent and convincing wins.
[3:55:20.900 --> 3:55:24.900]  And they make a race eligible to be declared as soon as the polls close.
[3:55:24.900 --> 3:55:27.900]  That way we get our election results very, very quickly.
[3:55:27.900 --> 3:55:29.900]  Guys, they have far too much power.
[3:55:29.900 --> 3:55:31.900]  Go look at AP cast.
[3:55:31.900 --> 3:55:34.900]  This debuted in 2018 for a reason.
[3:55:34.900 --> 3:55:36.900]  Pretty certain of it.
[3:55:36.900 --> 3:55:39.900]  The other thing I wanted to mention too was on the snake theory.
[3:55:39.900 --> 3:55:41.900]  There's a lot of back and forth on this.
[3:55:41.900 --> 3:55:46.900]  There was a Time Magazine cover shot back in 1999.
[3:55:46.900 --> 3:55:52.900]  And it had the AMA insignia of the snake, although the green snake was extremely highlighted.
[3:55:52.900 --> 3:55:57.900]  And this was in 1999, in January, January 11th of 1999.
[3:55:57.900 --> 3:56:07.900]  And they also stated on the cover that genetic engineering and medicine was going to be the new frontier.
[3:56:07.900 --> 3:56:08.900]  Interesting.
[3:56:08.900 --> 3:56:13.900]  Big ol' green snake on the cover with genetic engineering on the inside.
[3:56:13.900 --> 3:56:15.900]  Isn't that interesting?
[3:56:15.900 --> 3:56:17.900]  Hmm, yeah.
[3:56:17.900 --> 3:56:25.900]  We're conspiracy theorists, although they have very, very long plans and long conspiracies in trying to do the things that they do.
[3:56:25.900 --> 3:56:27.900]  They were announcing it in 1999.
[3:56:27.900 --> 3:56:29.900]  Kind of freaky, right?
[3:56:29.900 --> 3:56:35.900]  So I just wanted to say, Brian Artist spent, Dr. Artist spent four months investigating that.
[3:56:35.900 --> 3:56:37.900]  Four months.
[3:56:37.900 --> 3:56:42.900]  To dismiss that within a week, to say that it has no relevance.
[3:56:42.900 --> 3:56:44.900]  Relevance, I'm sorry.
[3:56:44.900 --> 3:56:52.900]  You know, I played a clip on my own show that was all about the news back in January 24th of 2020.
[3:56:52.900 --> 3:56:58.900]  Stating when the news anchors asked this person, he said, well, it comes down to snakes, snakes and bats.
[3:56:58.900 --> 3:57:03.900]  And they thought that that was the origin of the coronavirus.
[3:57:03.900 --> 3:57:08.900]  Isn't it interesting that they were still talking about snakes, they've done studies and studies and studies on snakes,
[3:57:08.900 --> 3:57:12.900]  and 50,000 studies later and papers later.
[3:57:12.900 --> 3:57:16.900]  He has something that everybody at least needs to look over the information.
[3:57:16.900 --> 3:57:19.900]  How can we decide in one week that it's not worthy of our attention?
[3:57:19.900 --> 3:57:22.900]  It doesn't make any sense, right?
[3:57:22.900 --> 3:57:24.900]  And so I would say, look in that direction.
[3:57:24.900 --> 3:57:25.900]  Look at those pieces.
[3:57:25.900 --> 3:57:27.900]  They're very, very, very compelling.
[3:57:27.900 --> 3:57:31.900]  And I, for one, can't just throw all those out, right?
[3:57:31.900 --> 3:57:32.900]  And say that they don't exist.
[3:57:32.900 --> 3:57:34.900]  There's just too much there.
[3:57:34.900 --> 3:57:38.900]  And there's too many studies and too many companies involved to throw that out.
[3:57:38.900 --> 3:57:40.900]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[3:57:40.900 --> 3:57:42.900]  Thank you to the Alex Jones show.
[3:57:42.900 --> 3:58:11.900]  And of course, have a great day.
[3:58:12.900 --> 3:58:14.900]  Thank you to the Alex Jones show.
[3:58:42.900 --> 3:58:44.900]  Thank you to the Alex Jones show.
[3:59:13.900 --> 3:59:15.900]  I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up?
[3:59:15.900 --> 3:59:19.900]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[3:59:19.900 --> 3:59:22.900]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[3:59:22.900 --> 3:59:26.900]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[3:59:26.900 --> 3:59:30.900]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[3:59:30.900 --> 3:59:32.900]  We had one too.
[3:59:32.900 --> 3:59:34.900]  I'm not sure if you want to believe it.
[3:59:34.900 --> 3:59:38.900]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[3:59:38.900 --> 3:59:45.900]  And if you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
