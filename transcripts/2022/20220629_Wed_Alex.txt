[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:16.000 --> 00:36.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:36.000 --> 00:53.000]  Joe Biden, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, all the usual suspects are telling us that a new pandemic and lockdowns are imminent.
[00:53.000 --> 01:20.000]  Let's look at lockdowns. It costs us trillions of dollars, and we're paying for that now with super high inflation, and I think I'm interested in when Johns Hopkins comes out with a study that said basically that didn't have any impact on mortality,
[01:20.000 --> 01:36.000]  and I don't know that that study addressed what mortality might have been impacted in terms of deferring other healthcare. Can we take lockdowns off the table in terms of what we do in the future?
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  I can't say because I don't know what that future holds for us.
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  What about the study that Johns Hopkins did because we're always saying pay attention to the science?
[01:45.000 --> 01:47.000]  I'm not familiar with that study, sir.
[01:47.000 --> 02:00.000]  The most recent data demonstrates that you are more likely to become infected or have disease or even death if you've been vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated people.
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.000]  This is shocking to hear, but it is what the data are showing us.
[02:05.000 --> 02:20.000]  The data now show that these experimental gene therapy treatments can damage your children as well as yourself. They can damage your heart, your brain, your reproductive tissue, and your lungs.
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.000]  This can include permanent damage and disablement of your immune system.
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  As the world plunges into financial crisis via hyperinflation.
[02:29.000 --> 02:41.000]  All of what we are seeing play out in Europe right now is an upsetting of the balance of the world order as they want it, as people like Dr. Harari, as people like Klaus Schwab, and others.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  Bill Gates is another one.
[02:43.000 --> 02:55.000]  So we have to understand that these are people that are very smart, they're very well resourced, and they have a very sort of strategic idea of how they want to see the world develop.
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  And God and a soul are not part of that strategy.
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.000]  Well, there's all the symptoms of the disease that is the new world order and globalism.
[03:06.000 --> 03:14.000]  And so the big question is how do we tackle globalism? How do we expose globalism? How do we dismantle and prosecute globalism?
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.000]  And then separately, how do we recognize the fruits of globalism to wake up our friends, family, neighbors, and strangers?
[03:21.000 --> 03:29.000]  So they understand why their lives are getting very bad, why crime is increasing, why they're going bankrupt.
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.000]  What is the worst thing they're doing? What is the number one thing they're doing that we need to stop?
[03:34.000 --> 03:47.000]  Evaluating the currencies, defunding the police, dissolving the borders, coming after our guns, launching war with Russia, preparing to release new bio weapons.
[03:47.000 --> 03:58.000]  But you know, they're not really preparing to release new bio weapons. They are releasing new bio weapons or targeting a new group of people with their bio nanotech weapon.
[03:58.000 --> 04:04.000]  And that is babies, six months old and up.
[04:04.000 --> 04:13.000]  Texas Children's Hospital started administering some shots yesterday. These vaccines are for those kids ages six months through four years.
[04:13.000 --> 04:20.000]  And because this group just received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration, Dell Medical School is trying to calm worried parents.
[04:20.000 --> 04:28.000]  The corrupt FDA had three different rounds of resignations, firings, off their board the last year and a half,
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.000]  because the board would not even authorize authorizing these experimental injections for anybody.
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  So they had one board resign or large portions of it. Then they got new people on and said, now we're going to go down to age 16.
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.000]  And a bunch of them said, no, now we're going to add boosters and shots every few months. No.
[04:45.000 --> 04:54.000]  And they've got a board now that unanimously voted to lie to the public and say that this works great, that it's a vaccine and that it totally protects you.
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.000]  When it isn't a vaccine, it doesn't protect you, destroys your immune system, causes all sorts of serious problems.
[05:00.000 --> 05:08.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 30 months, we've witnessed the globalist hit humanity and hit humanity extremely hard.
[05:08.000 --> 05:17.000]  It is beyond critical that everyone listening to the sound of my voice protect yourselves and your families to the greatest extent possible.
[05:17.000 --> 05:24.000]  And these two new sales do that. We have the ultimate immune support, 60% off when you get these four items together.
[05:24.000 --> 05:32.000]  The immune support, X2, D3 gummies and multivitamin. The immune support formula is incredible by itself.

[05:42.000 --> 05:47.000]  And then 40% off on X2, now back in stock at ImploreStore.com.

[05:56.000 --> 06:02.000]  40% off back in stock, but get four of the products together for 60% off.
[06:26.000 --> 06:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, June 29th, 2022. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:41.000 --> 06:49.000]  And we have huge developments happening on the geopolitical world financial stage, domestically and so much more.
[06:49.000 --> 06:56.000]  There's a big report that just went live at ImploreStore.com. It's getting almost no attention here in the control western press.
[06:56.000 --> 07:07.000]  The organization of BRICS, that's one of the largest global organizations out there of nations, announces new world reserve currency as America commits economic suicide.
[07:07.000 --> 07:18.000]  That report, I'm going to be breaking down next segment. Zelensky demands five billion from NATO cities for security in Europe.
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.000]  Whatever that means, so much insane news breaking on the Ukraine front.
[07:23.000 --> 07:31.000]  U.S. officials doubt Ukraine can take back territory, White House losing confidence. The Russians are winning the war.
[07:31.000 --> 07:41.000]  We've got some very dramatic maps. We're going to be getting to at the start of the next hour that show where the Russians have gained control and are keeping control
[07:41.000 --> 07:48.000]  and expanding that control and why those areas they're in control of are so critically important.
[07:48.000 --> 07:57.000]  That's coming up as well. Huge news on the targeting of six month old babies and up with the experimental shots and the horrible health effects
[07:57.000 --> 08:08.000]  and how the CDC knowingly lied, ladies and gentlemen, on the safety data and on the danger to children from COVID.
[08:08.000 --> 08:16.000]  It is dramatic CDC caught using false data to recommend kids the deadly COVID shot. That's coming up next hour as well.
[08:16.000 --> 08:27.000]  But in this hour, in this hour, Roger Stone is going to be joining us exclusively at the bottom of the hour here in about 23 minutes from now.
[08:27.000 --> 08:39.000]  Roger has been massively defamed again. So have I. So have the American people claiming that Trump called him or told Mark Meadows to call him and to call
[08:39.000 --> 08:49.000]  General Flynn and plan what happened at the Capitol. It's just absolutely ridiculous.
[08:49.000 --> 09:01.000]  Trump did not call Roger. Mark Meadows did not call Roger General Flynn. It is totally made up. But that's why I've had the Jan 6 committee and federal
[09:01.000 --> 09:13.000]  grand juries and the FBI and the Justice Department want to ask me about a phone call that I supposedly had with Stone and Flynn.
[09:13.000 --> 09:20.000]  And the answer is we didn't have the phone call. I'm not talking to you because you know that you've got my damn phone records.
[09:20.000 --> 09:27.000]  And you've got the White House phone records. They're just making it up. And the reason I raise that is the reason Roger is joining us is not just that.
[09:27.000 --> 09:35.000]  The wheels have come off their deceptions. This Cassidy Hutchinson, who was fawning after Trump to get a job after he left the White House,
[09:35.000 --> 09:43.000]  was not given a job in Marlago. So she's gotten angry and made all this up. Trump came out yesterday and instantly said none of this is true.
[09:43.000 --> 09:49.000]  And then the Secret Service said, yeah, no such thing happened. He didn't climb up the front of the car. He didn't grab the wheel.
[09:49.000 --> 09:58.000]  None of this is true. He's sitting away in the back. And then she also said that she wrote this handwritten note on what Trump's directives were on
[09:58.000 --> 10:08.000]  January 6th. And it turns out she didn't. And they've already had others testify to that. I mean, the woman is a liar.
[10:08.000 --> 10:17.000]  And we just see this going on and on and on, committing crimes, under oath, and Liz Cheney, it's come out, knew that she was lying,
[10:17.000 --> 10:24.000]  and knew who wrote the handwritten note, but still didn't call her on it.
[10:24.000 --> 10:32.000]  But why are they able to get away with this? Because they get away with it because they are not held accountable.
[10:32.000 --> 10:41.000]  They never get in trouble because the Justice Department is completely corrupt at the top. These people have a free hand to cut off our pipelines,
[10:41.000 --> 10:50.000]  to get rid of our borders, to devalue our currencies, for the puppet president's son to have a bunch of child porn and video him having sex with children,
[10:50.000 --> 11:00.000]  underage girls. All that's okay. Chinese top spies giving them orders. All that's come out and they get in zero trouble.
[11:00.000 --> 11:10.000]  And when you try to cover what's in the laptop during the campaign the last few months of 2020, you get censored, you get shut down, you get targeted.
[11:10.000 --> 11:21.000]  So that's how this system is operating, and they may not get convicted in the actual courts, but they've been convicted in the court of public opinion,
[11:21.000 --> 11:29.000]  and almost everyone I know that we're liberals are now awake and ashamed of themselves and really, really upset about what's happening.
[11:29.000 --> 11:35.000]  And it's finally inflation that's really got through to people and seeing Biden up there saying, well, it's a transition.
[11:35.000 --> 11:43.000]  Well, inflation's good for you a few months ago. And now he's like, oh yeah, you know who's to blame? Putin and the gas stations.
[11:43.000 --> 11:53.000]  They're the ones. Everybody knows gas stations hardly make any money per gallon of fuel and they have it there to get you in the store.
[11:53.000 --> 12:03.000]  So this is just one incredible time to be alive right now. We're going over all of our lies and more when we come back in the next segment
[12:03.000 --> 12:13.000]  and they are dramatic. And they're just so intense. But I guess it's really pees in a pond or birds of a feather fly together, flock together.
[12:13.000 --> 12:22.000]  Because you have Schiff on the committee, who three times we know of he's been caught, I'm sure there's more, totally falsified documents and emails
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.000]  and change the words around to say something completely different.
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  She's testifying. She heard Trump say, I want to join an armed insurrection and take the Capitol over.
[12:33.000 --> 12:40.000]  There's no other witnesses. It's not true. Trump wanted 10,000 National Guard there. Trump was concerned about Antifa.
[12:40.000 --> 12:49.000]  It doesn't matter. She's not going to get in trouble. So she might as well say Trump turns into a demon and has a black tongue that comes out.
[12:49.000 --> 12:58.000]  Oh, no, no, no, no. That's me. CNN has multiple witnesses that I turn into the exorcist and a black tongue shoots out.
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.000]  And I got to tell you, I didn't cover this a few weeks ago when it first aired, but I'm going to go ahead and play it.
[13:03.000 --> 13:09.000]  It's so funny, except it's not funny. I'd never even heard of a black tongue.
[13:09.000 --> 13:15.000]  I didn't even know that you, I mean, I know if you get hung, your tongue can turn dark purple when you're dead and kind of stick out of your mouth.
[13:15.000 --> 13:21.000]  But I talked to a medical doctor friend of mine. He said, a black tongue is impossible in a living person.
[13:21.000 --> 13:30.000]  But the point is, he's like Trump's grabbing steering wheels and once armed insurrections and he's calling us, but he didn't call us.
[13:30.000 --> 13:39.000]  And I've got black tongues and become demon possessed. I mean, these people are the demons. These people are the ones promoting pedophilia.
[13:39.000 --> 13:51.000]  These are the people promoting all of this toxic, destructive culture. And now they're up there with just a steady stream of people lying about myself and Trump and Roger Stone
[13:51.000 --> 13:56.000]  and the American people and flyover country in general.
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.000]  There are a lot of mentally ill people who are very stupid, who think if they can get on CNN or get up in front of Congress and tell a lie,
[14:02.000 --> 14:18.000]  that it gives them power or cashier with the elites. And what it does is, once everybody, you're a horrible person and you have blackballed yourself in real society for the rest of your lives.
[14:18.000 --> 14:28.000]  All of these people have destroyed themselves. And that goes for all the people that have gone to the New York Times and the Washington Post and CNN and ABC News
[14:28.000 --> 14:36.000]  and just told bald face lies about me. It doesn't hurt me that they're lying about me. Nobody believes CNN. Nobody believes it.
[14:36.000 --> 14:51.000]  But it's so painful when you've done nothing to people, but they get sucked into the power structure and think they're becoming successful and think they're arriving and think that they are winners.
[14:51.000 --> 14:59.000]  When all they are is modern Benedict Arnold's. It's extremely sick and sad, but I got to say this. If there's no accountability for these lies,
[14:59.000 --> 15:08.000]  what's going to happen in the future with these people? They're just going to tell bigger and bigger and bigger lies and I guess just discredit themselves more and more
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  so then they'll double down again and it's already become absurdist.
[15:12.000 --> 15:24.000]  Men can have babies. Don't say a man can't be a woman in California to get arrested. Two women had a baby in prison. No, they didn't.
[15:24.000 --> 15:34.000]  Look at these headlines. I don't believe in witchcraft. Alex Jones childhood pal recalls his talking in tongues and having a black tongue.
[15:34.000 --> 15:43.000]  Wow. But see, they come up with lies so fantastic that people go, well, some of that's got to be real.
[15:43.000 --> 15:51.000]  I mean, surely they wouldn't say that Trump grabbed the wheel of the Secret Service and tried to hijack the vehicle. I mean, it's got to be true, right?
[15:51.000 --> 16:00.000]  Nobody tell a lie that big. Yeah. The Secret Service says he's a big fat liar.
[16:00.000 --> 16:07.000]  The Internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex Jones was right. People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[16:07.000 --> 16:18.000]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming. I tried to stop it and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever
[16:18.000 --> 16:25.000]  because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents. It's now out in the open.
[16:25.000 --> 16:34.000]  What Paul Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group. So now the fight's out in the open.
[16:34.000 --> 16:41.000]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule. We're going to win this thing. God's watching the children counting on us.
[16:41.000 --> 16:48.000]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[16:48.000 --> 16:54.000]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[16:54.000 --> 17:00.000]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[17:00.000 --> 17:07.000]  The globalists are making their move. Their great reset is here. They're coming for your children. They're coming for the value of your currency.
[17:07.000 --> 17:14.000]  They're coming for your national sovereignty. They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny.
[17:14.000 --> 17:19.000]  They're coming for your free speech. They're coming for your privacy.
[17:19.000 --> 17:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're coming for your right to vote and have your representative in government that you and your fellow Americans choose.
[17:26.000 --> 17:39.000]  The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary ever made in my view, 2000 mules is now available on DVD with expanded extras at infowarsstore.com.

[20:24.000 --> 20:34.000]  Out of the fiction of some woman's mind, during the January 6th kangaroo court show trial extravaganza,
[20:34.000 --> 20:39.000]  we're going to look at this Cassidy Hutchinson and all the lies.
[20:39.000 --> 20:45.000]  She's been caught in basically everything she said is a total lie that can instantly be proven to not be true.
[20:45.000 --> 20:57.000]  But now I know why they think Roger Stone talked to Mark Meadows. They think I was talking to Trump because people like this are just making it up.
[20:57.000 --> 21:04.000]  I hadn't talked to Trump in like a year before January 6th. I missed some of his phone calls. He called me a few times.
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.000]  I know because it was the White House switchboard calling, but I had talked to him over a year.
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.000]  I frankly didn't even care to. I was so upset about the whole vaccine thing.
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  I knew he was pigheaded, but that's a side issue. That's a private matter.
[21:16.000 --> 21:23.000]  The point is, is that you tell these people, I didn't talk to Trump. They go, fine, we'd like the FBI to come in and talk to you.
[21:23.000 --> 21:27.000]  No, you got my phone records. I'm not talking to you. And then they spit it.
[21:27.000 --> 21:32.000]  Jones is coming into the FBI. Jones is coming in to expose Trump.
[21:32.000 --> 21:42.000]  We see that the New York Times, Washington Post, total lies. Every stinking bed of it.
[21:42.000 --> 21:49.000]  And people call me. They go, hey, we hear you're going to turn on Trump. Turn on Trump for what?
[21:49.000 --> 21:54.000]  Trump didn't want the Capitol attack. He wanted 10,000 National Guard there. The Fed stood down.
[21:54.000 --> 22:03.000]  They went to a thousand FBI armed in the crowd. It's been declassified and they let it happen while I sat there and tried to stop the damn thing.
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  Anybody needs to be arrested. It's whoever gave them the orders to stand down, just like Uvaldi.
[22:08.000 --> 22:13.000]  I'm trying not to get angry, but the more I think about this, man, I am just so sick of these people.
[22:13.000 --> 22:21.000]  Everything they accuse us of is what they've done.
[22:21.000 --> 22:29.000]  I want that police chief and Uvaldi arrested. I want whoever gave the order to the Justice Department for the feds to stand down that day,
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  because from my sources, they wanted to stop it.
[22:31.000 --> 22:37.000]  I'm going to ask the feds another question. Why the hell do you follow orders and not stop the few hundred people trying to break in?
[22:37.000 --> 22:42.000]  See, I'm starting to get really angry right now. I'm going to calm down. That's not where I was going.
[22:42.000 --> 22:48.000]  Roger Stone's next segment. Roger Stone's next segment. We're going to get into all of it then. Let me just control myself.
[22:48.000 --> 22:53.000]  But let me tell you what's coming up next hour. I wasn't going to get to this now, but I just won't have time in this segment,
[22:53.000 --> 23:01.000]  because it's a link to your report for Greg Rees. It's so important. I'm going to get to it next hour.
[23:01.000 --> 23:08.000]  Major nations like China and Russia and India have agreed to move off of the dollar.
[23:08.000 --> 23:15.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, to describe what it'll mean if that actually happens is curtains financially.
[23:15.000 --> 23:24.000]  Do you think we got inflation now? When the world stops accepting dollars, we turn into the road warrior overnight.
[23:24.000 --> 23:33.000]  And let me tell you something. I'm ready for this, and I'm prepared somewhat, and I'm right with God, but I'm scared of this.
[23:33.000 --> 23:39.000]  I'm not scared of being put in prison or killed for doing the right thing, but I am scared of bad effects in society,
[23:39.000 --> 23:51.000]  and I am scared of the general public when they can't feed their children, and you've got a spoiled nation.
[23:51.000 --> 23:56.000]  And so you tell the average person, hey, the dollar won't be the world's reserve currency. I don't care. I don't trade currencies.
[23:56.000 --> 24:03.000]  They have no idea what that even signifies or means if it goes belly up, which every policy of the globalist is to kill the dollar
[24:03.000 --> 24:08.000]  while they claim they're trying to strengthen it. That's coming up next hour.
[24:08.000 --> 24:16.000]  Gavin Newsom, the word is, is the one that's going to be replacing Biden if they're able to steal the next election, the next general election.
[24:16.000 --> 24:21.000]  We have Gisling Maxwell sentenced to 20 years in prison for trafficking in those thousands of little girls.
[24:21.000 --> 24:29.000]  A lot of folks may have forgotten about the 50 plus dead people found in the tractor trailer in South Texas two days ago.
[24:29.000 --> 24:34.000]  Left there to die locked up inside that death trap by the coyotes.
[24:34.000 --> 24:41.000]  Now, white guy killing 50 Hispanics, you'd have top story in the nation, burning cities, white people are evil.
[24:41.000 --> 24:48.000]  But because it's Hispanics killing Hispanics, nobody cares.
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  Well, I do. I care. And so does the Mexican president.
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.000]  Mexico claims U.S. can't control its border. That's not a claim.
[24:56.000 --> 25:02.000]  It's not being controlled on purpose, and now it's completely broken, and then it may never ever be able to fix it.
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  The dam is broken. That's coming up next hour as well. The Roger Stones next segment.
[25:06.000 --> 25:13.000]  But let me do this because it's very, very exciting.
[25:13.000 --> 25:20.000]  We have a giant sale going right now of amazing products that you and your family really, really need.

[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  We got to blow it out to fund the operation at infowarstore.com.
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.000]  And I want to explain something here. With what's going on in the world, you want to boost your immune system.
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  And a lot of these products really, really do that, but they do a lot more amazing things as well.
[27:06.000 --> 27:13.000]  And here's something just as important. We have to sell these products to have funds to operate into the future.
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  Even though most of these products we only have a few thousand bottles left of,
[27:17.000 --> 27:22.000]  and we're not even sure when we're going to get more, but I'm in that catch 22 of where we've got to move it.
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  So this could be the last time you ever get these products. We absolutely need the funding
[27:26.000 --> 27:31.000]  and their amazing products at 360WIN at infowarstore.com.
[27:31.000 --> 27:36.000]  It is the July 4th super sale blowout that is starting right now.
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.000]  And I have taken the donations and the Bitcoin donations and things and put orders in
[27:41.000 --> 27:46.000]  on eight of our best selling products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns.
[27:46.000 --> 27:51.000]  And we got in a bind because of supply chain breakdowns, didn't have funds from other products being sold.
[27:51.000 --> 27:56.000]  So we didn't have the money to even buy those popular products now that they're actually available again.
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  Highest quality proprietary, but now we do. And so in one month,
[28:01.000 --> 28:06.000]  four of the products come back in, and in two months, the other four products come in.
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  Hooray! Hallelujah! Thank you for that donor.
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.000]  So we can take that donation and then double it to stay on the air.
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  So we're talking about the nick of time, ladies and gentlemen.

[31:10.000 --> 31:14.000]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare.
[31:14.000 --> 31:17.000]  And that alone is something to be grateful for.
[31:17.000 --> 31:25.000]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut off.

[31:37.000 --> 31:46.000]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods.
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  And water filtration.
[31:48.000 --> 31:53.000]  Whoever sews bountifully will also reap bountifully.

[33:00.000 --> 33:27.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:27.000 --> 33:35.000]  You know, the most frightening part about the deep state Democrats is that they're so arrogant and so stupid and everything they do blows up in their face.
[33:35.000 --> 33:36.000]  But they don't care.
[33:36.000 --> 33:42.000]  They just double down again with countries like Russia and Vladimir Putin, not just with the American people.
[33:42.000 --> 33:43.000]  It is insane.
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  They've almost killed the dollar.
[33:45.000 --> 33:51.000]  The BRICS group made up of Russia, China, India and a bunch of other countries says they're leaving the dollar and it's happening.
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.000]  I mean, you talk about putting America into a collapse.
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.000]  You talk about running us over the rocks if we were a ship.
[33:57.000 --> 33:58.000]  This is it.
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  We're crashing us into an iceberg.
[34:00.000 --> 34:01.000]  This is insane.
[34:01.000 --> 34:09.000]  This is our live Wednesday broadcast June 29th, January 6th show trial whistleblower breaks records for congressional perjury.
[34:09.000 --> 34:17.000]  Cassidy Hutchinson told provable lies repeatedly on national stage with help of Liv Shaney and other deep state operatives.
[34:17.000 --> 34:24.000]  And now the Secret Service by name says they want to testify that none of what she said is true and they never told anyone that.
[34:24.000 --> 34:29.000]  No one ever claimed that Trump went crazy and tried to grab the wheel and did all this.
[34:29.000 --> 34:30.000]  It is all made up.
[34:30.000 --> 34:40.000]  It's also come out that she lied about who wrote a note and said that she did it when it's on record and already testified who did and Shaney knew that and said nothing.
[34:40.000 --> 34:50.000]  And then of course there's this lie that Trump supposedly telling Mark Meadows that Roger Stones never even talked to Mark Meadows to call him in General Flynn.
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  I mean lie after lie after lie.
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  Here's one of them.
[34:54.000 --> 35:05.000]  Miss Hutchinson, is it your understanding that President Trump asked Mark Meadows to speak with Roger Stone and General Flynn on January 5th?
[35:05.000 --> 35:06.000]  That's correct.
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  That is my understanding.
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  And Miss Hutchinson, is it your understanding that Mr. Meadows called Mr. Stone on the 5th?
[35:12.000 --> 35:22.000]  I'm under the impression that Mr. Meadows did complete both a call to Mr. Stone and General Flynn the evening of the 5th.
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  They're doing it again, Roger.
[35:24.000 --> 35:28.000]  They claim that you were in Commander WikiLeaks, never talked to Assange, never said you did.
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  And now they're telling another whopper of a lie pointing their finger right at you.
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  How surreal is this, my friend?
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  Please respond.
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  It's deja vu all over again.
[35:40.000 --> 35:51.000]  I mean, not since the Ukrainian impeachment have I seen a more ham-handed, fabricated, loose, contrived narrative.
[35:51.000 --> 36:02.000]  This is essentially an elaborately produced television show with a fictional timeline that's one big infomercial against Donald Trump.
[36:02.000 --> 36:11.000]  If this was really a January 6 investigation, where is the stunning footage of the cold-blooded murder of Ashley Babbitt,
[36:11.000 --> 36:21.000]  the unarmed, decorated Air Force veteran who was shot in cold blood without warning, without a stand-down order, and was completely unarmed?
[36:21.000 --> 36:28.000]  Where is the footage of Roseanne Boylan being bludgeoned to death by Capitol Hill police officers?
[36:28.000 --> 36:37.000]  Where is an examination of why the enormous doors of the Capitol that can only be opened electronically from the inside were open?
[36:37.000 --> 36:38.000]  Where are those facts?
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  Instead, they hyped this up.
[36:41.000 --> 36:44.000]  So remember, Alex, it's key to recall.
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  We were told the hearings were done for June.
[36:46.000 --> 36:51.000]  Then they hastily said we have a surprise witness in newly found information.
[36:51.000 --> 36:58.000]  They won't tell anybody all day Thursday, or all day, pardon me, the day before who it is.
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  It's enormous hype, just hype.
[37:01.000 --> 37:09.000]  And they produce this woman who not only tells a completely fabricated tale, now debunked by the Secret Service,
[37:09.000 --> 37:15.000]  that Donald Trump pitched a fit when his detail refused to drive him to the Capitol,
[37:15.000 --> 37:22.000]  tried to grab the wheel, physically impossible, physically assaulted a Secret Service agent, also not true.
[37:22.000 --> 37:29.000]  And then there's this whopper, as you point out, that the president, she knew, she didn't say she heard,
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.000]  she said, is it your understanding?
[37:32.000 --> 37:33.000]  Yes, it's my understanding.
[37:33.000 --> 37:34.000]  What does that mean?
[37:34.000 --> 37:46.000]  She alleges that the president told his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to call me and General Flynn on January 5th,
[37:46.000 --> 37:52.000]  to ask us what was going to happen on the 6th.
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.000]  I've never spoken to Mark Meadows on the phone, ever.
[37:57.000 --> 38:03.000]  I met him once when he was a congressman in the green room at Fox, other than that I've never spoken to him at all.
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  I just heard from General Flynn.
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  He also did not hear from Meadows.
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.000]  He's never spoken to Meadows on the phone on any occasion, either.
[38:11.000 --> 38:14.000]  He met him once in December in the White House.
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.000]  So this is an effort to pull us into a narrative.
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.000]  As you know, Alex, you're subject to it as well as we are.
[38:21.000 --> 38:34.000]  To be very clear, any claim or insinuation or even implication that I knew about was involved in or condoned any illegal action on January 6th at the Capitol
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.000]  or on any other date and places categorically false.
[38:38.000 --> 38:46.000]  Nor was I involved in any of the legal efforts regarding the outcome of the election with Steve Bannon or Giuliani or any of these other folks.
[38:46.000 --> 38:51.000]  So let me ask you this. Clearly, they've been trying to ask you and me about Mark Meadows. You've never talked to Meadows, neither have I.
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  This is all made up.
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  So we know it's coming from the committee. They're making this up and having her lie.
[38:57.000 --> 39:05.000]  Why would they have her lie about such demonstrably provable things that we didn't talk to Trump, you didn't talk to Trump,
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.000]  General Flynn didn't talk to Trump about that or that day or expanding?
[39:10.000 --> 39:16.000]  Why would she say he grabbed the wheel and tell such a crazy lie when she knew the Secret Service would come out and say she's a liar?
[39:16.000 --> 39:21.000]  Do they just think that a lie goes halfway around the world where the truth puts its pants on?
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  Let's take this in two parts.
[39:23.000 --> 39:30.000]  If you can attack Roger Stone and Alex Jones on Twitter, then you can whip up a hysteria, which is the purpose of these hearings.
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  So this is used for our billification.
[39:32.000 --> 39:40.000]  If you want to pull the names of the two of the most hated villains on the American Left into any outgoing post,
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.000]  include the names of Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[39:43.000 --> 39:51.000]  The level of hatred, the tsunami of hatred that this whips up against us, Alex, is useful to these people, even though it is completely baseless.
[39:51.000 --> 40:00.000]  On the second issue, I am a little surprised, but look, these are the same people who made up and edited the Ukraine phone call.
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  It's the same exact people.
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  This is an Adam Schiff production, and you should never forget that.
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.000]  So truth, facts have nothing to do with it.
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.000]  And of course, the line by omission about January 6.
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  Where's the testimony of Ray Epps?
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  When is FBI operative Ray Epps going to testify?
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.000]  We've seen video of him urging people into the building, urging violence.
[40:23.000 --> 40:29.000]  At the same time, you and Ali Alexander are telling people to pull back and not to go into the Capitol.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  He's urging people to go in.
[40:31.000 --> 40:34.000]  Where is his testimony?
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.000]  So I asked the question again, and you just explained it there, but why do they think they can get away with it?
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  When they know there's phone records showing this call didn't happen.
[40:42.000 --> 40:47.000]  When they know that he didn't attack the Secret Service driver and try to take control of the vehicle,
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.000]  he can't even get up to the front of the vehicle the way it's designed.
[40:50.000 --> 40:56.000]  Why would they say that she wrote a note that's on the congressional record that somebody else wrote who's testified they did?
[40:56.000 --> 41:00.000]  Why would she just tell lie after lie after lie?
[41:00.000 --> 41:05.000]  Because they count on the fact that the initial charge will get enormous coverage,
[41:05.000 --> 41:12.000]  enormous coverage everywhere across the board in the Trump-pating legacy media.
[41:12.000 --> 41:21.000]  And they also know that it is only largely the conservative outlets like InfoWars, Breitbart, the National File, Frank Speech,
[41:21.000 --> 41:24.000]  that will cover the fact that much of this is debunked.
[41:24.000 --> 41:27.000]  So they still do their damage.
[41:27.000 --> 41:38.000]  Now, they look foolish, but watch how quickly the truth about this incident with the Secret Service agent rotates out of the press.
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.000]  Yet they have made the case that Trump is unhinged.
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  That was the purpose.
[41:42.000 --> 41:48.000]  And then they try to drag our names into it just to whip up more hatred and more violence.
[41:48.000 --> 41:56.000]  When we come back, I want to get your view over all the 2022 midterms coming up and what tricks you think the deep state might pull
[41:56.000 --> 42:03.000]  and also the situation with the economy and more and just generally where you see the J6 hearings going.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  I know you're on record saying they've fallen on their face.
[42:05.000 --> 42:06.000]  Everybody else agrees.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  Low ratings, but they don't seem to give up.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  What do you expect them to do next with 40 seconds?
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  Well, they have an audience of one, Merrick Garland.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  Can they convince him to charge Donald Trump?
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  I think that's the question on the table.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  That's what they are seeking to do.
[42:21.000 --> 42:28.000]  They're seeking to write a contrived indictment of Donald Trump and hand it over to the attorney general.
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.000]  Wow.
[42:29.000 --> 42:30.000]  You talk about reckless.
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  How could they convince this young woman to do stuff like this?
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.000]  Well, what's particularly odious is the fact that she said all these things.
[42:39.000 --> 42:46.000]  Yet after this period where she makes all these assertions against the president, she was seeking to join his staff at Mar-a-Lago.
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  She was seeking to go into his post-president staff.
[42:50.000 --> 42:51.000]  Sure.
[42:51.000 --> 42:52.000]  So it's sour grapes.
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  It's sour grapes.
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.000]  It's a disgruntled employee.
[42:54.000 --> 42:55.000]  Wow.
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.000]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone exclusive.
[42:56.000 --> 43:25.000]  Stay with us.
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  Here is a quick recap.
[43:28.000 --> 43:29.000]  Let's get started.
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  This is all about the best selling product.
[43:31.000 --> 43:32.000]  It's a special product.
[43:32.000 --> 43:33.000]  It's an amazing product.

[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  Like the ultimate immune support pack.

[43:57.720 --> 43:59.720]  family at InfoWarsStore.com.
[43:59.720 --> 44:02.440]  So I did it.
[44:02.440 --> 44:04.600]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[44:04.600 --> 44:09.240]  I've been training, probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[44:09.240 --> 44:12.240]  and thank goodness for InfoWarsStore.com.
[44:12.240 --> 44:17.480]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some Turbo Force to give me that energy I need to
[44:17.480 --> 44:18.480]  get going.
[44:18.480 --> 44:22.880]  You know, besides the energy, Turbo Force, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like
[44:22.880 --> 44:28.040]  vitamin C to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained
[44:28.040 --> 44:31.640]  energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[44:31.640 --> 44:35.280]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis.
[44:35.280 --> 44:37.600]  I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[44:37.600 --> 44:42.240]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation
[44:42.240 --> 44:44.640]  support and extra flexibility.
[44:44.640 --> 44:48.920]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[44:48.920 --> 44:53.880]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, Turbo Force, that can
[44:53.880 --> 44:57.960]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and Sorilis can keep you
[44:57.960 --> 45:26.960]  moving and feeling great at any age.
[45:26.960 --> 45:55.800]  And that's it for today's video, I hope you enjoyed it, I'll see you in the next one.
[45:57.960 --> 46:07.280]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all, and if we
[46:07.280 --> 46:11.360]  don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[46:11.360 --> 46:17.120]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare, and that alone is something to
[46:17.120 --> 46:18.560]  be grateful for.
[46:18.560 --> 46:24.080]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of
[46:24.080 --> 46:29.800]  your taps getting shut off, and having your own food will save you from getting ensnared
[46:29.800 --> 46:32.040]  in government FEMA camps.
[46:32.040 --> 46:36.480]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider
[46:36.480 --> 46:39.320]  stocking up for your neighbors.
[46:39.320 --> 46:44.800]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by
[46:44.800 --> 46:49.720]  having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[46:49.720 --> 46:54.560]  Your sews bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[46:54.560 --> 47:01.120]  Stock up now at PrepareToday.com.
[47:01.120 --> 47:25.600]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:25.600 --> 47:29.240]  Look, I'm not going to bore you with the clips of the lies of the January 6th committee.
[47:29.240 --> 47:31.040]  It's all over the nose.
[47:31.040 --> 47:35.960]  I came out and she said he lunged towards a steering wheel, tried to grab control in
[47:35.960 --> 47:40.440]  hijacked the vehicle, which is, again, the most insane sounding thing you could come
[47:40.440 --> 47:41.760]  up with.
[47:41.760 --> 47:46.160]  Now, Trump has said, hey, I wanted to go to the Capitol, and the Secret Service said
[47:46.160 --> 47:52.120]  it wasn't safe, and overrode me and took me back to the White House.
[47:52.120 --> 47:57.520]  But obviously, Trump did not lunge up and grab the wheel.
[47:57.520 --> 48:02.500]  He's been caught in a bunch of other lies, one of them about Roger Stone and General
[48:02.500 --> 48:10.000]  Flynn, who they're just desperate, desperate, desperate, desperate to tie to this big lie
[48:10.000 --> 48:11.520]  that there was this planned attack.
[48:11.520 --> 48:17.040]  And now, Roger, we have this video, I'll play in a moment, of the Proud Boys days before
[48:17.040 --> 48:22.920]  January 6th in a Zoom conversation saying, we're there to be peaceful.
[48:22.920 --> 48:27.360]  We're not there to cross the line and fight with anybody or go into the Capitol.
[48:27.360 --> 48:29.000]  We are there to be guardians.
[48:29.000 --> 48:30.760]  That's what I'd heard they were there to be.
[48:30.760 --> 48:34.200]  Our concern was anti-footbombing the hotel or shooting us.
[48:34.200 --> 48:35.880]  That's why we had security.
[48:35.880 --> 48:37.960]  I had my own paid security.
[48:37.960 --> 48:40.840]  You had volunteer security.
[48:40.840 --> 48:41.960]  That's what our belief was.
[48:41.960 --> 48:45.560]  No one even imagined this would happen, because we always had peaceful rallies.
[48:45.560 --> 48:49.680]  We just had two huge ones, one with a half a million folks a month before NBC.
[48:49.680 --> 48:53.480]  So you got cut off by the break when I was asking, why would a young woman lie like this,
[48:53.480 --> 48:57.320]  and what will the Jan 6th Committee do next, when this is obviously not working?
[48:57.320 --> 49:01.200]  Is that like you elaborate just in general about the Democratic Party's attempt to outlaw
[49:01.200 --> 49:02.600]  their political opposition?
[49:02.600 --> 49:06.320]  Well, look, the purpose of this is just a relentless attack.
[49:06.320 --> 49:10.120]  You said it earlier, Alex, they hate us because we're warriors.
[49:10.120 --> 49:13.080]  So for me, this means bigger and bigger legal fees.
[49:13.080 --> 49:16.000]  I have to pay attorneys to defend myself.
[49:16.000 --> 49:22.720]  I've already, as you know, met my legal obligations under their subpoena, but I pled the Fifth
[49:22.720 --> 49:27.080]  Amendment, not because I've done anything wrong, not because I have anything to hide,
[49:27.080 --> 49:32.040]  but because I have extensive experience with their ability to twist innocuous, immaterial,
[49:32.040 --> 49:35.040]  irrelevant things you say into a crime.
[49:35.040 --> 49:39.000]  My wife and I still face 11 civil lawsuits.
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.200]  These are harassment suits that are sensationalized, but baseless, designed to drag your name through
[49:44.200 --> 49:48.040]  the mud and to gin up more legal fees.
[49:48.040 --> 49:53.440]  So folks can help me at StoneDefenseFund.com, StoneDefenseFund.com.
[49:53.440 --> 49:59.040]  I need your help there, only through the support of the Info Warrior community and so many
[49:59.040 --> 50:04.720]  other patriots have I been able to continue to fend off these demons.
[50:04.720 --> 50:06.240]  They attack you, Alex.
[50:06.240 --> 50:07.320]  They attack me.
[50:07.320 --> 50:08.680]  They are relentless.
[50:08.680 --> 50:13.040]  They have no regard for truth or fact or reality.
[50:13.040 --> 50:18.000]  It's all, this is all an elaborately produced television show.
[50:18.000 --> 50:21.040]  They're desperate to eliminate Donald Trump.
[50:21.040 --> 50:23.040]  That's the greatest question.
[50:23.040 --> 50:28.080]  And so they're successful punishing Trump supporters and punishing leaders of the populist
[50:28.080 --> 50:31.240]  peaceful resistance, but they're not successful winning hearts and minds.
[50:31.240 --> 50:36.480]  As you know, all the polls show what I believe is the biggest political realignment since
[50:36.480 --> 50:42.000]  1776, a total turning against the Democratic Party and other leftist groups around the
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.000]  world.
[50:43.000 --> 50:44.000]  That's what I'm seeing.
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  What are you seeing?
[50:45.000 --> 50:51.440]  Well, potentially, yes, that we are a majority and between gas prices, food shortages, epic
[50:51.440 --> 50:58.480]  inflation, foreign policy bungling in which we lose billions of dollars of sophisticated
[50:58.480 --> 51:05.720]  offensive equipment in Afghanistan, writing a check for 40 billion for Ukraine when we
[51:05.720 --> 51:14.240]  can't spend, you know, 5.7 million to seal our own southern border, a fentanyl epidemic
[51:14.240 --> 51:19.600]  in the country, a crime epidemic in the country based on the fact that the prosecutors in
[51:19.600 --> 51:25.720]  most major cities elected with the financial help of George Soros refused to prosecute violent
[51:25.720 --> 51:27.440]  crime of any kind.
[51:27.440 --> 51:29.000]  So the stage is set.
[51:29.000 --> 51:36.840]  However, Alex, your premise requires a free, fair, honest, transparent election.
[51:36.840 --> 51:42.800]  And the movement for electoral law reform has not come far enough since the last election
[51:42.800 --> 51:44.960]  to ensure that in every state.
[51:44.960 --> 51:50.480]  In fact, ironically, the states who have improved their election laws are overwhelmingly Republican
[51:50.480 --> 51:53.840]  states that were already carried by Donald Trump.
[51:53.840 --> 51:57.080]  But Arizona's process has not been cleaned up.
[51:57.080 --> 52:00.600]  Nevada's process has not been cleaned up.
[52:00.600 --> 52:05.000]  Pennsylvania's mail-in ballots are before the Supreme Court.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.080]  They're unconstitutional, but they may be in place.
[52:09.080 --> 52:14.480]  So it's just too early to say whether this red wave can manifest itself in an honest
[52:14.480 --> 52:15.480]  election.
[52:15.480 --> 52:21.680]  The fundamentals are very definitely there for a great Republican resurgence.
[52:21.680 --> 52:27.880]  But that does not mean it's a MAGA resurgence or an America-first resurgence if the Congress
[52:27.880 --> 52:29.440]  is controlled by the rhinos.
[52:29.440 --> 52:30.440]  That's right.
[52:30.440 --> 52:33.280]  If the rhinos can use this wave and get in there, then we're right back where we were
[52:33.280 --> 52:41.080]  unless we have a strong cadre or a swing vote, as you've said, of MTG types, of Jim
[52:41.080 --> 52:46.640]  Jordan types, of Matt Gaetz types, that can then be the siding factor and can checkmate
[52:46.640 --> 52:49.000]  the rhinos and the leftists.
[52:49.000 --> 52:53.800]  Let's get to this Proud Boys clip because it's important, and I want to finish up here
[52:53.800 --> 52:55.280]  with January 6.
[52:55.280 --> 52:57.680]  We still have hundreds and hundreds of people in jail.
[52:57.680 --> 52:59.800]  Many of them have not had a trial yet.
[52:59.800 --> 53:06.280]  They're in gulags while Democrats bomb abortion, anti-abortion birthing centers around the
[53:06.280 --> 53:07.880]  country and firebomb them.
[53:07.880 --> 53:08.880]  It's just insane.
[53:08.880 --> 53:14.200]  We have this video from Zoom that it turns out the prosecution had, but hadn't handed
[53:14.200 --> 53:18.240]  over, was trying to block from some of these trials that are starting, where they're openly
[53:18.240 --> 53:23.640]  talking about their plan not to get in fights with Antifa first and to not go into the capital.
[53:23.640 --> 53:26.080]  Here it is.
[53:26.080 --> 53:30.400]  We're never going to be the ones to cross the police barrier or cross something in order
[53:30.400 --> 53:31.800]  to get to somebody.
[53:31.800 --> 53:34.880]  We're always going to be the ones standing back, right?
[53:34.880 --> 53:38.320]  And we're always going to be the ones to defend, and we've been really good at it.
[53:38.320 --> 53:42.720]  We've been, let's be honest, we've been really good at that.
[53:42.720 --> 53:49.280]  And it goes on for 20 minutes, the videos up on infowars.com and the Gateway Pundit.
[53:49.280 --> 53:56.360]  So this is just, you know, a few weeks before, there's also other videos of days before,
[53:56.360 --> 54:00.760]  and they go through great detail how we're peaceful, we're not going to attack anybody,
[54:00.760 --> 54:04.440]  we're not going to invade anything, and then they see the doors open, they see if this
[54:04.440 --> 54:09.720]  all happens, some of them go in, and they're charged with seditious conspiracy, Roger.
[54:09.720 --> 54:14.680]  Alex, look, this is a constant game of guilt by association.
[54:14.680 --> 54:17.000]  No, I'm not a member of the Proud Boys.
[54:17.000 --> 54:18.000]  I never have been.
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.800]  Yes, I do know individual members of the Proud Boys.
[54:20.800 --> 54:25.920]  No, I don't approve of any violent or illegal act on January 6th, and I know nothing about
[54:25.920 --> 54:27.640]  any plan to do so.
[54:27.640 --> 54:33.120]  I noticed that members of the Proud Boys have been charged and will go to trial.
[54:33.120 --> 54:36.560]  This would have seemed to be excellent evidence in their defense.
[54:36.560 --> 54:40.280]  Beyond that, I hadn't seen it until now.
[54:40.280 --> 54:47.760]  But this constant guilt by association, Stone, who is associated with the Proud Boys and
[54:47.760 --> 54:53.600]  the Oath Keepers, let me be clear, I couldn't hire private security because none was available.
[54:53.600 --> 54:58.920]  All of the off-duty DC police officers who had provided security for me and my family
[54:58.920 --> 55:04.560]  during my trial and the many pretrial motions for which I had to visit Washington were unavailable.
[55:04.560 --> 55:08.440]  I accepted the voluntary security of the Oath Keepers.
[55:08.440 --> 55:14.920]  I have no knowledge of any individual or collective Oath Keepers having any illegal plans on January
[55:14.920 --> 55:15.920]  6th.
[55:15.920 --> 55:16.920]  Yes, Roger.
[55:16.920 --> 55:22.000]  We know, and I'm in the same boat, 100%, but all I'm getting at is this persecution of
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.560]  American citizens and their rights being violated is extremely dangerous, and if they continue
[55:26.560 --> 55:30.840]  to have their rights violated, it sets a precedent for all of us to be turned into basically
[55:30.840 --> 55:32.040]  Julian Assange.
[55:32.040 --> 55:35.240]  That is absolutely true, plus the spying state.
[55:35.240 --> 55:37.760]  I mean, you have been a big advocate for Volta Wireless.
[55:37.760 --> 55:43.840]  It's a product I like because I don't want the government or Google or Apple collecting
[55:43.840 --> 55:48.680]  all the information from my cell phone.
[55:48.680 --> 55:54.600]  We've seen in the lab that the FBI has used warrantless searches on 3 million Americans.
[55:54.600 --> 55:56.600]  That came out recently.
[55:56.600 --> 55:59.000]  CDC is tracking people through their cell phones.
[55:59.000 --> 56:00.600]  Over a million citizens.
[56:00.600 --> 56:03.520]  So this is my other great concern.
[56:03.520 --> 56:08.280]  We only got about 45 seconds left, but Roger, will the January 6th committee or this new
[56:08.280 --> 56:13.800]  liar they've put up in front of them that reminds me of that Colonel Vidman or whatever
[56:13.800 --> 56:16.440]  his name was, will they ever get in trouble for their lives?
[56:16.440 --> 56:20.640]  Because you were charged for lying to Congress and you didn't, but she's ball-faced lying.
[56:20.640 --> 56:23.640]  Yeah, and nothing will happen about that whatsoever.
[56:23.640 --> 56:24.640]  Certainly not under the Democrats.
[56:24.640 --> 56:28.280]  If you take control, the Republicans can take control of the House.
[56:28.280 --> 56:32.040]  Will they go vindictively and refer her to justice?
[56:32.040 --> 56:34.800]  They might, but then I don't see justice charging her.
[56:34.800 --> 56:37.520]  No, we have a two-tier justice system.
[56:37.520 --> 56:42.360]  These people tried to destroy my life when I didn't lie to Congress, yet people like
[56:42.360 --> 56:48.640]  Rod Rosenstein, Vidman, many others, and of course the Congressman himself, they're exempt.
[56:48.640 --> 56:52.800]  So they can't be held responsible for lies that they tell on the floor.
[56:52.800 --> 56:55.720]  They can't be sued for vilifying you on the floor.
[56:55.720 --> 56:59.760]  But they are being convicted in the court of public opinion.
[56:59.760 --> 57:01.320]  Trump's going to run in 2024.
[57:01.320 --> 57:02.320]  We know that.
[57:02.320 --> 57:03.320]  30 seconds.
[57:03.320 --> 57:05.840]  When does he announce and what happens to DeSantis?
[57:05.840 --> 57:08.800]  I think he announces sooner rather than later.
[57:08.800 --> 57:11.080]  I think he announces as early as July.
[57:11.080 --> 57:16.280]  I think these kind of attacks probably accelerate that, if anything.
[57:16.280 --> 57:20.760]  DeSantis needs to stick to his knitting and get reelected governor before he could move
[57:20.760 --> 57:23.120]  out openly in a presidential campaign.
[57:23.120 --> 57:26.960]  I do think he is sizing up, taking on the champ.
[57:26.960 --> 57:31.560]  New National poll last week out of McLaughlin and Associates in the Gateway Pundit shows
[57:31.560 --> 57:34.600]  that Trump easily dispatches all comers.
[57:34.600 --> 57:35.880]  It's his race to lose.
[57:35.880 --> 57:36.880]  Hold on, Roger.
[57:36.880 --> 57:37.880]  This is too hot.
[57:37.880 --> 57:39.200]  Do five more minutes with us if you can.
[57:39.200 --> 57:43.360]  I want you to continue to talk about the midterms, but first, more on Trump as early as this
[57:43.360 --> 57:45.120]  July, meaning like a week.
[57:45.120 --> 57:47.640]  He could be announcing the 2024 run.
[57:47.640 --> 57:48.640]  Wow.
[57:48.640 --> 57:55.920]  The Internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones is right.
[57:55.920 --> 57:57.440]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[57:57.440 --> 58:01.600]  Well, it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[58:01.600 --> 58:07.320]  I tried to stop it and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important
[58:07.320 --> 58:13.480]  than ever because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents.
[58:13.480 --> 58:15.120]  It's now out in the open.
[58:15.120 --> 58:20.720]  Paul Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[58:20.720 --> 58:21.720]  Group.
[58:21.720 --> 58:24.720]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[58:24.720 --> 58:27.920]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[58:27.920 --> 58:28.920]  We're going to win this thing.
[58:28.920 --> 58:29.920]  God's watching.
[58:29.920 --> 58:30.920]  The children are counting on us.
[58:30.920 --> 58:34.560]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[58:34.560 --> 58:38.000]  your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[58:38.000 --> 58:42.400]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the
[58:42.400 --> 58:44.680]  reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[58:44.680 --> 58:49.200]  I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[58:49.200 --> 58:51.800]  your efforts.
[58:51.800 --> 58:56.640]  I don't have to tell you that fish oil is known to be so good for your brain, so good
[58:56.640 --> 59:02.200]  for your heart, so good for your cells, your cardiovascular system, your lungs, your sleep.
[59:02.200 --> 59:03.200]  It's amazing.

[59:10.200 --> 59:12.800]  highest quality, purest fish oil out there.

[59:49.760 --> 1:00:09.760]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:09.760 --> 1:00:21.960]  Well, it's Roger Stone that helped prime the pump to get President Trump to run.
[1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:24.920]  And he is a close confidant of him, I'll leave it at that.
[1:00:24.920 --> 1:00:25.920]  First rule of fight club.
[1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:31.280]  It's no talk about fight club, but Trump wasn't going to run for president right after they
[1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:32.960]  stole the election from him.
[1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:37.480]  But then because the lies and the attacks and him seeing the country dirt, he told Roger
[1:00:37.480 --> 1:00:43.480]  and many others, this has now come out, yeah, and that was what, six, seven months ago.
[1:00:43.480 --> 1:00:47.120]  And so I just asked Roger to start over and repeat it because this is without being interrupted
[1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:48.120]  by break.
[1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:49.600]  This is big news.
[1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:56.520]  Roger Stone just said as early as next month, Trump could declare, what, on July 4th, next
[1:00:56.520 --> 1:01:01.160]  Monday, Trump could declare he's running for president again.
[1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:05.880]  Man, you talk about explosive, Roger, please start over.
[1:01:05.880 --> 1:01:10.920]  In all honesty, Alex, as I've said here on the program before, I expected the president
[1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:15.840]  to wait till after the midterms, but to become a candidate fairly early.
[1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:22.160]  I now believe that he could be accelerating his timeframe because all of these attacks
[1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:26.360]  on him need to be seen in the context of the political attacks there are.
[1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:29.520]  And the reason they're attacking him is because they don't want him to run.
[1:01:29.520 --> 1:01:32.720]  So therefore he will defy them, I think, by running.
[1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:36.480]  And I do think it could be as early as the first week of July.
[1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:39.360]  Now, there's a bunch of fake news stories out there.
[1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:45.400]  There's one specifically that said he wants to announce at a location somehow close to
[1:01:45.400 --> 1:01:51.840]  the governor's mansion in Tallahassee, Florida, to somehow twit Ron DeSantis.
[1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:53.840]  That is untrue.
[1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:56.440]  The president's not running because of heat from DeSantis.
[1:01:56.440 --> 1:01:58.360]  The polls don't reflect that.
[1:01:58.360 --> 1:02:03.360]  I think the president is running to grab the narrative because he is on attack and he needs
[1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:08.080]  a superior platform from which to counterattack.
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:10.760]  I totally agree with you, and I really like DeSantis.
[1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:13.920]  I know you've had some issues with DeSantis, but I like what he's doing on the vaccines.
[1:02:13.920 --> 1:02:14.920]  I like what he's doing.
[1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:16.680]  He's becoming more hardcore.
[1:02:16.680 --> 1:02:18.600]  What are your concerns about DeSantis?
[1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:21.120]  Well, he's very, very disciplined.
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:22.760]  He's been very good on some issues.
[1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:25.040]  I like the way he's taken on the culture wars.
[1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:28.600]  I liked his crackdown against the mass mandates.
[1:02:28.600 --> 1:02:34.320]  He did advocate the vaccination pretty aggressively early on, but look, I don't want him to run
[1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:35.320]  off and be president.
[1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:37.920]  I want him to finish the job in Florida.
[1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:43.560]  Remember, Andrew Gillum, who was arrested just days ago, came within 30,000 votes of
[1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:45.280]  beating Ron DeSantis.
[1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:51.160]  And while DeSantis is popular, he's also, like Trump, extremely polarizing.
[1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:52.920]  This is not a red state, Alex.
[1:02:52.920 --> 1:02:54.600]  This is a purple state.
[1:02:54.600 --> 1:02:55.600]  It swings blue.
[1:02:55.600 --> 1:02:57.240]  It swings red.
[1:02:57.240 --> 1:02:58.880]  And I want the governor to stay here.
[1:02:58.880 --> 1:03:02.960]  The alternative is a disaster.
[1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:07.560]  So did Trump tell you this, or a little bird, or you're just looking at the calculus, a
[1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:12.880]  July 4th announcement of Trump during the January 6th committee would politically show
[1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:16.800]  that this is a political targeting right out in the open?
[1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:23.920]  I'm not going to identify my source, but I think it is highly probable that we're looking
[1:03:23.920 --> 1:03:25.280]  at a July announcement.
[1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:29.280]  Now, the thing to remember about Donald Trump is he's perfectly capable of changing his
[1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:31.360]  mind on a dime.
[1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:34.000]  That's called tactical flexibility.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:41.360]  The only thing predictable about Donald Trump is that he's totally and completely unpredictable.
[1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:44.480]  Roger, obviously, when I get off here today, this is very interesting news.
[1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:45.480]  I'm glad I asked the question.
[1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:49.360]  I'll be needing to call you for a little confidential discussion, but this is very big.
[1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:51.120]  We really appreciate you sharing this with us.
[1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:53.320]  Again, people really need to support you.
[1:03:53.320 --> 1:03:57.120]  It's great to go make donations for the legal fund to keep you in the fight, but people
[1:03:57.120 --> 1:03:59.360]  also need to get some of those sexy t-shirts you've got.
[1:03:59.360 --> 1:04:01.880]  I mean, seriously, your t-shirt designers are amazing.
[1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:05.760]  How do folks get a Roger Stone shirt or an Ultra Magga shirt?
[1:04:05.760 --> 1:04:06.760]  Perfect.
[1:04:06.760 --> 1:04:09.760]  Go to rogerstonesstore.com.
[1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:10.760]  rogerstonesstore.com.
[1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:11.920]  You can get this t-shirt.
[1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:17.840]  You can get the iconic Roger Stone t-shirt, rogerstonesstore.com.
[1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:20.480]  Can I have permission to rip that off?
[1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:21.800]  That's a really cool design.
[1:04:21.800 --> 1:04:23.960]  Look up for us so we can see it.
[1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:25.360]  That looks really good.
[1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:26.360]  Absolutely.
[1:04:26.360 --> 1:04:29.080]  Yeah, we're going to make something similar to that.
[1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:31.960]  But even better, Alex, why don't you post my link online?
[1:04:31.960 --> 1:04:33.840]  That would really help the Stone family.
[1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:34.840]  We will, brother.
[1:04:34.840 --> 1:04:35.840]  All right.
[1:04:35.840 --> 1:04:36.840]  There you go.
[1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:37.840]  Let me see the back.
[1:04:37.840 --> 1:04:39.160]  Anything on the back?
[1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:40.520]  Let me see the Nixon tattoo.
[1:04:40.520 --> 1:04:41.520]  Pull it up.
[1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:42.520]  No, no, no, no.
[1:04:42.520 --> 1:04:43.520]  It's going to go viral.
[1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:44.520]  Oh, I can't see it.
[1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:47.080]  You'd have to pay extra for that.
[1:04:47.080 --> 1:04:49.400]  Oh, that's the scriptees, huh?
[1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:51.160]  All right, buddy.
[1:04:51.160 --> 1:04:52.160]  We'll talk soon.
[1:04:52.160 --> 1:04:53.160]  Thank you so much.
[1:04:53.160 --> 1:04:54.160]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:04:54.160 --> 1:04:55.160]  Keep fighting.
[1:04:55.160 --> 1:04:56.160]  All right.
[1:04:56.160 --> 1:04:57.160]  We'll be right back with big news.
[1:04:57.160 --> 1:04:58.160]  Stay with us.

[1:06:10.360 --> 1:06:12.960]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:14.960]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:06:14.960 --> 1:06:41.200]  Sorry, I'm a little late getting back on air, that was just a one minute break as we
[1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:44.480]  joined some stations that don't care that first little five minutes.
[1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:48.840]  That little hors d'oeuvre we do at the start of each hour, some stations carry news, which
[1:06:48.840 --> 1:06:52.720]  is fake news most of the time, so a lot of stations want us to do the first five minutes
[1:06:52.720 --> 1:06:56.240]  so they can just have a few minutes of ads there or whatever, but I was talking to Roger
[1:06:56.240 --> 1:07:02.520]  Stone about Trump and Trump right now, if you know how to read the tea leaves, what
[1:07:02.520 --> 1:07:10.080]  Roger said, I'm trying to still thunder here, Trump is intending to declare his 2024 run
[1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:13.160]  on July 4th.
[1:07:13.160 --> 1:07:22.160]  Now as Roger said, that's tactical flexibility, sorry, this is just when you get a big giant
[1:07:22.160 --> 1:07:27.000]  kahuna news breaker like that, makes the little pitter-patter get excited because I love to
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:33.200]  break big news, but as he said, it's like Elvis has got Marilyn Monroe in the bed and
[1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:36.000]  they're about to do the deed, maybe Elvis decides he's a little tired, doesn't want
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.760]  to do it and he turns the light out.
[1:07:38.760 --> 1:07:47.800]  So Trump is intending on July 4th to announce the 2024 run, you talk about blood coming
[1:07:47.800 --> 1:07:55.720]  out of the eyeballs of the left, you think they're upset about Roe v. Wade, they hate
[1:07:55.720 --> 1:08:03.440]  more babies as Trump, so this is just insane, so I'm very glad I called Roger Stone today
[1:08:03.440 --> 1:08:10.360]  and let me tell you, he's not a Besser, he tells you something, but here's the deal,
[1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:20.520]  you heard him say it, Trump may make a tactical decision or tactical flexibility not to announce
[1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:31.760]  July 4th, but as it stands right now, Trump is going to announce 2024 run this Monday.
[1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:36.400]  You know, I was thinking about taking off that day and hanging out with the dudes over
[1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:40.560]  at their house and their kids and my kids, or my five-year-old, all my other kids are
[1:08:40.560 --> 1:08:44.720]  basically grown up now, man, life goes by fast, let me just warn you if you're young,
[1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:49.280]  I'm still pretty young, but I feel young, but man, I got a 19-year-old son, an 18-year-old
[1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:55.840]  daughter, a 14-year-old daughter and a five-year-old daughter, but sorry, I'm kind of poleaxed
[1:08:55.840 --> 1:09:04.680]  right now by this news here, absolutely insane, plus this morning I was hiking on the green
[1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:09.960]  belt and I find really cool fossils all the time, sometimes these really big, ancient
[1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:14.240]  conch shells and things that are huge, beautiful, my house is full of them, but I don't have
[1:09:14.240 --> 1:09:19.040]  to look up in the cliffs and things and see their shape, so I'm hiking along this area
[1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:22.920]  and I look way up and I think, oh, that's a, that looks like a shell, that looks like
[1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:28.120]  a fossil, let me, let me scrabble up that embankment up to that, and of course it wasn't
[1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:33.400]  what I thought it was, but I found those many times that way and I'm getting old here and
[1:09:33.400 --> 1:09:39.040]  I blew my back out, kind of slipped and fell and slid down that thing a little bit and feels
[1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:44.120]  like somebody's punched me right in the kidney right there, but I'm going to be fine, I took
[1:09:44.120 --> 1:09:55.800]  some Advil, but I'm just processing right now, processing right now that Trump is going
[1:09:55.800 --> 1:10:00.520]  to run and going to announce on July 4th right now, it's like when somebody's got a gun to
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:04.560]  your head with the hammer back on their finger on the trigger and they decided to blow your
[1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:09.640]  brains out, now they might decide not to, but he's got it locked and loaded right now
[1:10:09.640 --> 1:10:17.240]  about to pull the trigger, and so that's where it's at, and that's a whole other subject,
[1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:22.760]  in fact, we got Alex Stein who went to New York and left us protested, even tried to
[1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:27.000]  shut down his free speech and we got incredible videos and the whole drag queen pedophile
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:35.240]  time situation, he's almost next hour, but I almost just want to clear the decks today
[1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:41.880]  and you know, maybe I need to come in tonight, I said I'd be doing this and do a two, three
[1:10:41.880 --> 1:10:47.120]  hour live internet only show and take calls like we did Saturday, boy did that show get
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:53.520]  viral, million views on M4s, half million people tuned in audio lives, just on internet
[1:10:53.520 --> 1:10:57.000]  only, so that's a million and a half on our site, and then the video from it got picked
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:02.440]  up everywhere, last count I had is over 20 million views of that show or segments of
[1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:06.720]  that show Saturday, doesn't this crew feel great coming in doing that with Savannah Hernandez
[1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:11.440]  and Drew Hernandez and then knock it out of the park, what about getting Roger back
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:16.920]  tonight for an hour or two, if he can do it and taking your calls, because let me tell
[1:11:16.920 --> 1:11:21.920]  you, I talked to him during the break, he said call me at the show, this is, yeah this
[1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:28.320]  is big, and obviously you can put two into it together, but I'm like is it the big guy,
[1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:34.880]  he had this big giant smile and he goes yeah call me call me later, so as it is right now
[1:11:34.880 --> 1:11:41.000]  ladies and gentlemen, Trump is declaring on July 4th, Trump is declaring on July 4th,
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:47.480]  2022, how big of a gigantic whopper is that, and again I can't stand what he did with the
[1:11:47.480 --> 1:11:52.440]  poison shots, but I love the Roe v. Wade, I love how he secured the border, I love how
[1:11:52.440 --> 1:11:56.160]  he showed up to China, I love how the dollar got strong, I love how he made his number
[1:11:56.160 --> 1:12:04.280]  one in energy, I mean the list just goes on, I love how he got us out of the WHO, I mean
[1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:07.040]  that's a big one right there, I mean there were hundreds of things Trump did, he meant
[1:12:07.040 --> 1:12:12.320]  well, and he believes in doctors man, he really thinks, because they told him this is all scientific
[1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:16.440]  and this is going to stop it sir, and we'll be able to reopen things, and by the way I
[1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:22.840]  meant to cover that yesterday, and I had video clips of it from national news, so you guys
[1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:26.640]  go into the list and pull me the articles and pull me the video, put it back on my desk
[1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:30.560]  so I can actually have it in front of me, thanks, poor crew's got to run around, let's
[1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:39.160]  shake up their heads, cut off all the stuff I asked for, they do a great job, the EPA
[1:12:39.160 --> 1:12:46.920]  slash FDA board that is in between both agencies came out, and they said you know, we're just
[1:12:46.920 --> 1:12:55.800]  going to stop even doing trials or studies on things, said the FDA, and the CDC agreed
[1:12:55.800 --> 1:13:02.520]  and so did the EPA, they said we're just going to stop doing studies, we're not going to
[1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:07.160]  look, we're not going to have trials anymore, and we're just going to give people whatever
[1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:12.760]  we want, that's the revolution Fauci four years ago in that C-SPAN show, all those
[1:13:12.760 --> 1:13:17.960]  scientists and all those heads of agency said is we're going to blow up the old system and
[1:13:17.960 --> 1:13:23.480]  have a system of where we just do whatever we want, and then there's no surveillance
[1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:30.680]  of what they're giving us to see what it's doing, can you believe that?
[1:13:30.680 --> 1:13:35.760]  Can you believe that, yeah they found the clips, there's a new one today, so there were two
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:41.360]  clips yesterday and a clip today, I mean that alone should be the whole show, so see here's
[1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:52.760]  my paradox, here's my conundrum, here's my point of really malfunctioning, I cannot compute,
[1:13:52.760 --> 1:13:57.640]  I want Trump, I don't want Biden, I don't want Governor Newsom, we know he'll be a hundred
[1:13:57.640 --> 1:14:05.680]  times better, but he went along with this, and so did DeSantis early on, DeSantis to
[1:14:05.680 --> 1:14:13.360]  his credit has come out against it now, so that's a whole question for callers, I kind
[1:14:13.360 --> 1:14:17.520]  of suspend everything we're doing right now and just ask that question, what do we do
[1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:22.640]  when Trump, right now he said he's doing it, like he intends to declare he's running for
[1:14:22.640 --> 1:14:33.560]  president on Monday, according to a little bird, so he may change that, but sooner rather
[1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:38.080]  than later, things are really hot politically right now, the Roe v. Wade, the January 6th
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:43.240]  circus, once he declares himself president, all the reckless attempts to declare mentally
[1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:52.320]  ill and insane aren't gonna work anymore, because you can't indict somebody who's running
[1:14:52.320 --> 1:14:56.520]  for president, that's the Justice Department rule, because then it becomes too obvious,
[1:14:56.520 --> 1:15:08.560]  so doesn't that make absolutely perfect sense, I'll make this decision, I never tell Owen
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:13.520]  Shroyer what to do, he does a great instinct, great talk show host, better be in many ways,
[1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:17.960]  but once a year, I say I never, once a year or so I'll call him and go hey obviously you're
[1:15:17.960 --> 1:15:21.960]  gonna be covering this right, he's always like yeah I'm already on it, I'm doing that, so
[1:15:21.960 --> 1:15:26.520]  I don't need to call Owen, he's just heads in the game, he's probably listening right
[1:15:26.520 --> 1:15:30.000]  now, he's boxing or lifting weights or playing basketball, literally listens while he does
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:35.680]  all that, sports themed, I wish I was in that great shape, obviously Owen's gonna be covering
[1:15:35.680 --> 1:15:42.080]  Trump 24 an ounce coming on Monday for his whole three hours today, 3-6 p.m. I got some
[1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:46.760]  meetings that gotta be in, but by 4 or 5 I could be on the show too, or maybe I just
[1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:50.000]  to spend all the news I was about to cover and cover this now and take your calls, what
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:54.440]  do you think folks, we'll talk about it when we come back, but I'm just blown away by this,
[1:15:54.440 --> 1:15:57.240]  Trump's gonna announce on Monday.
[1:15:57.240 --> 1:16:03.080]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex Jones was right, people ask
[1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:07.440]  what's it like to be vindicated, well it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew
[1:16:07.440 --> 1:16:13.360]  this was coming, I tried to stop it and now everything I've talked about is gonna become
[1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:19.520]  more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and
[1:16:19.520 --> 1:16:26.160]  documents, it's now out in the open, Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth,
[1:16:26.160 --> 1:16:31.640]  the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group, so now the fight's out in the open, they're
[1:16:31.640 --> 1:16:35.760]  making their move because they know they're behind schedule, we're gonna win this thing,
[1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:39.160]  God's watching, the children are counting on us, I just wanna thank the viewers and
[1:16:39.160 --> 1:16:42.520]  listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because
[1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:46.560]  without you, info wars would not be here, I just want you to really internalize the
[1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:51.600]  fact that you are the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance,
[1:16:51.600 --> 1:16:56.120]  so I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[1:16:56.120 --> 1:16:57.120]  your efforts.
[1:16:57.120 --> 1:17:01.680]  The National Suisse's new film 2000 Mules is the most important documentary in modern

[1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:21.640]  and your family with what's coming and what is already unfolding with level food shortages.
[1:19:21.640 --> 1:19:26.600]  I told you over two years ago the globe was going to have massive inflation and food shortages
[1:19:26.600 --> 1:19:31.520]  and it's happened just like clockwork and I'm telling you it's going to get a lot worse,
[1:19:31.520 --> 1:19:36.840]  they have designed this, the way to beat them is to buy food now before your dollar is even
[1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:42.840]  more devalued, we're ready to ship to you right now at preparetoday.com and not just

[1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:45.680]  All right, here's what's going on, I have massive economic news that will affect every
[1:20:45.680 --> 1:20:49.880]  one of us, bigger than anything we've ever experienced, if you think inflation is bad
[1:20:49.880 --> 1:21:01.920]  right now, I mean I shudder in anger at myself that I am not running around 24-7 myself getting
[1:21:01.920 --> 1:21:07.000]  prepared, getting ready, which I'm already somewhat prepared, but that's my flesh, my
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:12.520]  flesh is smart but it's also weak because it thinks about itself and says you get ready,
[1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:17.680]  you protect yourself, but if I don't use the spirit that's more powerful, light years more
[1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:25.520]  powerful and fight the tyranny and stand against it, then all the horrible stuff will happen
[1:21:25.520 --> 1:21:29.720]  and then some and then it won't matter how prepared I get, you understand?
[1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:34.680]  That's the paradox, you've got to spend, in my experience, the vast majority of your
[1:21:34.680 --> 1:21:43.160]  time fighting to stop evil, fighting to expose it and then sometime being prepared.
[1:21:43.160 --> 1:21:48.560]  But we've entered the season now where it's not about stopping it anymore, it's about
[1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:52.240]  getting prepared more and more.
[1:21:52.240 --> 1:21:55.480]  So I was going to get to this big Brexit report, we'll actually play it at the start
[1:21:55.480 --> 1:21:58.200]  of the next segment, it's so powerful.
[1:21:58.200 --> 1:22:02.200]  Bricks announces a new world reserve currency as America commits economic suicide, it's
[1:22:02.200 --> 1:22:06.600]  a perfect headline by Gregory's, look I love my whole crew, they're all amazing, I mean
[1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:11.280]  Jeremy Green and all of them are as smart as I am or smarter, Gregory's is like every
[1:22:11.280 --> 1:22:18.280]  one of his reports is Grand Slam out of the park, Muhammad Ali meets Babe Ruth, I mean
[1:22:18.280 --> 1:22:24.920]  it's just, it's ridiculous, but he's on target, it's posted at infowars.com, we're going to
[1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:29.040]  play that at the start of the next segment and then I'm going to take ten phone calls
[1:22:29.040 --> 1:22:32.440]  ahead of Alec Stein and then when he leaves us, if you're still on the hold, I'll get
[1:22:32.440 --> 1:22:35.280]  to you but I don't want to keep everybody on hold, Alec Stein's going to be joining us
[1:22:35.280 --> 1:22:39.360]  but I want to take ten phone calls, please don't load twenty up guys because if we do
[1:22:39.360 --> 1:22:47.360]  that then you know, I won't get to them all, but I'm going to take ten phone calls, we're
[1:22:47.360 --> 1:22:50.680]  not going to open the phones up yet, we're going to open them up at the start of the
[1:22:50.680 --> 1:23:00.160]  next segment and we're going to take ten phone calls on what do you think on this Wednesday
[1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:07.920]  June 29th broadcast directly from someone that talked to Donald John Trump that he is
[1:23:07.920 --> 1:23:17.480]  right now saying he's looking to announce, he thinks he's going to announce on July 4th
[1:23:17.480 --> 1:23:23.840]  in five days, that is seismic, whether you hate Trump, whether you're neutral on Trump,
[1:23:23.840 --> 1:23:32.200]  whether you love Trump, that is so gigantic, that is so incredibly seismic and we'll get
[1:23:32.200 --> 1:23:40.080]  Alec Stein's take on that as well and take calls while he's on, so rack up fifteen calls,
[1:23:40.080 --> 1:23:46.160]  our phone system takes twenty, I don't want anybody left behind and hey, I did as good
[1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:50.240]  a job yesterday as I did twenty years ago, in twenty years I haven't gotten back to where
[1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:53.520]  I was in my first six, seven years of talk radio where I could take thirty, forty phone
[1:23:53.520 --> 1:23:58.680]  calls an hour, we did it yesterday, I shut up, I got the callers on and moved the next
[1:23:58.680 --> 1:24:03.360]  person, that means you've got to get to your point, so I'm going to give you the total
[1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:10.600]  free number, when we come back for first time callers today, you're sixty seconds on what
[1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:22.280]  do you think of the exclusive, and I'm not as excited as such a big exclusive, the ramifications
[1:24:22.280 --> 1:24:27.720]  of it are wild, what are the ramifications of Trump running, because they're trying to
[1:24:27.720 --> 1:24:33.400]  put him in prison and he knows that if he announces his run, whatever they cook up
[1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:38.760]  or do, historically they cannot indict someone who is prominent, who's already been president
[1:24:38.760 --> 1:24:45.720]  and who's running for president again, this is so big and I hope Trump, just to freak
[1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:50.320]  these people out and drive them into the ground, he also sees the sanis in polls starting to
[1:24:50.320 --> 1:24:57.560]  be eclipsing, oh yeah all the planets have aligned, Trump right now is planning to announce
[1:24:57.560 --> 1:25:01.480]  his second run for president at the United States, only guy that never ran for office
[1:25:01.480 --> 1:25:12.600]  and became president first time, except Abraham Lincoln, did Abraham Lincoln, I forget his,
[1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:17.920]  did Abraham Lincoln ever hold office for he became president, I think he was a prominent
[1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:23.840]  lawyer, but just one, I think he's on, guys look up Abraham Lincoln, look up, just give
[1:25:23.840 --> 1:25:32.440]  me the encyclopedia on him, his political career, wow, so if I seem distracted right
[1:25:32.440 --> 1:25:38.560]  now, I am completely distracted by the ramifications of this, I mean this is a big deal, you don't
[1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:42.480]  need me telling you that, and you don't need me to tell you that whatever happens with
[1:25:42.480 --> 1:25:47.800]  Trump or the sanis or any of this, you need us to be on air, fighting harder than ever,
[1:25:47.800 --> 1:25:51.840]  at a point where our talking points that I developed from research and the Holy Spirit
[1:25:51.840 --> 1:25:56.480]  and understanding and callers and guests and a fusion of all this together, immersed in
[1:25:56.480 --> 1:26:05.120]  this 20 hours a day, 18 hours a day, some days 20 hours a day, most days 15, I've learned
[1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:11.480]  to cut back or I go completely insane, they don't want this brain trust, this spirit
[1:26:11.480 --> 1:26:15.960]  trust on air, they want to get to you and they got to get through us to get to you,
[1:26:15.960 --> 1:26:19.080]  they want to get to my children, they got to get through me first, they want to get
[1:26:19.080 --> 1:26:23.200]  to your family, they got to get through you first, and I'm telling you I'm on record,
[1:26:23.200 --> 1:26:28.960]  the one thing I want to do is beat these Satanists and I don't back off 1%, I am full on war
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:32.520]  with these people, but I need your back and if you want me to go in there and stomp the
[1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:37.040]  living hell out of these people, so I want you to go now to infowarstore.com as you've
[1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:41.640]  done before and gotten great products that enrich you, that enrich us, that we 360 win

[1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:32.880]  seller, we got 20,000 bottles of it and nobody wants to buy it and nobody likes it and guys
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:37.160]  that have beards think they don't need that kind of crap with our audience, it's a super
[1:27:37.160 --> 1:27:43.440]  vitamin mineral, high end multivitamin mineral that kids could take, old people, young people,
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:46.600]  you name it, I'm tempted to pull the labels off of it and just say multivitamin on it,
[1:27:46.600 --> 1:27:50.240]  we can't keep the multivitamin stock and quite frankly that's what I said when we got this
[1:27:50.240 --> 1:27:54.560]  in, I said this is a better formula than our multivitamin which is incredible, this one's
[1:27:54.560 --> 1:27:56.120]  a little bit better.
[1:27:56.120 --> 1:28:00.000]  So the hair and beard formula is an amazing multivitamin mineral for your immune system,

[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:08.880]  in God, but tie up your camel, Hunter S. Thompson put it this way, pray to God but row away
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:13.760]  from the rocks, if your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God but you don't get smashed
[1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:17.840]  on him and killed but also try to row away, you can't just sit there like a jellyfish and

[1:31:01.720 --> 1:31:06.600]  rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these
[1:31:06.600 --> 1:31:11.400]  profiles, you see it every year, 30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different
[1:31:11.400 --> 1:31:16.760]  tax returns, 50 different answers and almost all of them just screw you over especially
[1:31:16.760 --> 1:31:20.840]  the big firms and the big tax groups because they're part of the system and they don't
[1:31:20.840 --> 1:31:25.120]  want the general public understanding this and knowing this, so it's a very important
[1:31:25.120 --> 1:31:31.160]  situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to
[1:31:31.160 --> 1:31:34.920]  do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money,
[1:31:34.920 --> 1:31:40.400]  we wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[1:31:40.400 --> 1:31:47.520]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com
[1:31:47.520 --> 1:31:53.520]  or call 833-904-285, 833-904-285.
[1:31:53.520 --> 1:32:03.960]  So I did it, I signed up for the Austin Marathon, I've been training probably not as much as
[1:32:03.960 --> 1:32:07.960]  they should be but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com.
[1:32:07.960 --> 1:32:14.320]  Before I start out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need
[1:32:14.320 --> 1:32:19.240]  to get going, you know besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins
[1:32:19.240 --> 1:32:24.480]  I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids
[1:32:24.480 --> 1:32:29.040]  for sustained energy giving me the best chance at getting through the training and then every
[1:32:29.040 --> 1:32:35.560]  day now I'm taking Dr. Jones Sorilis, I have bad joints, thanks mom, so this is great for
[1:32:35.560 --> 1:32:40.680]  giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation support and extra
[1:32:40.680 --> 1:32:41.680]  flexibility.
[1:32:41.680 --> 1:32:46.200]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[1:32:46.200 --> 1:32:50.880]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, turbo force that can
[1:32:50.880 --> 1:32:55.000]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and Sorilis can keep you
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:58.800]  moving and feeling great at any age.
[1:32:58.800 --> 1:33:11.200]  Completing a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:11.200 --> 1:33:19.960]  We are on the march, the New World Order pedophiles are on the run.
[1:33:19.960 --> 1:33:24.840]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:24.840 --> 1:33:29.280]  All right, we're going to take your phone calls right through the next hour, riding
[1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:33.000]  a shotgun with Alex Stone, he'll love to take your phone calls because I'm not going to
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:36.680]  preempt him for this big news, he'll just ride along with us.
[1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:40.600]  Roger Stone earlier on air, I said when is Trump going to announce because he's told
[1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:44.240]  Roger and others he's going to run, I told you that six, seven months ago, Trump changed
[1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:46.200]  his mind, they mess with him too much.
[1:33:46.200 --> 1:33:52.520]  He did not have fun as president, let me tell you, he busted his ass and now because of
[1:33:52.520 --> 1:33:56.440]  the mess with him in America and what he sees going on, this is what he said, he's going
[1:33:56.440 --> 1:34:01.960]  to run and I said when is that announcement and a little bird in Florida right where Roger
[1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:12.280]  lives down the street from Trump told Roger that Trump's looking at Monday, July 4th,
[1:34:12.280 --> 1:34:17.600]  that is a big deal, I'm going to take your calls on that subject, on that subject alone
[1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:30.000]  for first time callers, 877-789-2539, 877-789, Alex, 877-789-2539, on that subject and that
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:34.800]  subject alone, please only call in on that subject, we love you, we usually have open
[1:34:34.800 --> 1:34:38.600]  free for all like yesterday for two hours, it was amazing, I love the free for all, love
[1:34:38.600 --> 1:34:45.000]  the wild card, today is on a wild card, today is one topic and one topic only and that is
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:49.480]  Trump 2024, are you for it or against it, what do you think, because you're here in
[1:34:49.480 --> 1:34:55.600]  tomorrow's news today, now he calls it tactical flexibility, he may not announce it Monday,
[1:34:55.600 --> 1:35:03.720]  but as of now Trump is intending to announce on Monday global exclusive, tomorrow's news
[1:35:03.720 --> 1:35:10.960]  today, next week's news today, 877-789-2539, here is the insane report I was going to spend
[1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:17.120]  most of the hour on, but we'll take your calls now, BRICS announcement, New World Reserve
[1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:22.680]  Currency as America Commits Economic Suicide, Greg Reese, the video report is at Band-Aid
[1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:34.080]  Video and then FullWars.com, you need to share it if you want to stop this, here it is.
[1:35:34.080 --> 1:35:41.200]  China has recently invited Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran, Egypt and several other countries to
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:50.200]  join BRICS, a growing world alliance led by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
[1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:56.000]  While some are reporting that BRICS is somehow challenging the globalists, this is demonstrably
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:01.880]  false, the original concept for BRICS was proposed by the chief economist for Goldman
[1:36:01.880 --> 1:36:09.800]  Sachs. BRICS's new development bank is staffed by known players of the IMF and World Bank
[1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:17.080]  and BRICS has repeatedly affirmed their commitment to the United Nations Agenda 2030. Aside from
[1:36:17.080 --> 1:36:24.320]  Brazil's President Bolsonaro, all of BRICS nation states have pushed the COVID-19 lockdowns
[1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:32.080]  and experimental shots, and China recently announced five more years of their brutal
[1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:38.200]  zero-COVID lockdowns. BRICS is also pushing a digital currency and has launched a vaccine
[1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:45.640]  research and development center for member states. BRICS is clearly not anti-globalist,
[1:36:45.640 --> 1:36:53.120]  even the CCP's state-run media explains how BRICS now leads the globalization mission.
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:59.040]  But they are all turning against the United States and its allies. Xi Jinping accused
[1:36:59.040 --> 1:37:04.680]  the US of weaponizing the financial system with their sanctions against Russia, which
[1:37:04.680 --> 1:37:11.040]  has caused the average person to suffer worldwide. And Vladimir Putin suggested that BRICS could
[1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:17.800]  provide a new world reserve currency. At the recent St. Petersburg International Economic
[1:37:17.800 --> 1:37:23.600]  Forum, Putin blamed the West for disrupting the international economy, and announced
[1:37:23.600 --> 1:37:30.720]  that NATO's unipolar world order is over. In just three months, Russia has managed to
[1:37:30.720 --> 1:37:35.960]  reverse inflation and has increased their financial surplus to more than four times
[1:37:35.960 --> 1:37:41.600]  it was last year. Russia is now thriving, and Putin announced that their international
[1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:47.160]  priority is to increase food deliveries to countries that need it the most. They are
[1:37:47.160 --> 1:37:53.600]  pouring billions into their farming communities, raised the minimum wage by 10%, and provided
[1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:59.560]  more money to pensioners and families with children. He also criticized the West for
[1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:06.960]  choosing an economic suicidal path and having suicidal intentions, which seems to be the
[1:38:06.960 --> 1:38:12.800]  only explanation for what the Biden administration is doing. They have deliberately cut off our
[1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:18.320]  fuel, which will cut off our food, and they are pushing the deadly shots for every single
[1:38:18.320 --> 1:38:24.600]  healthy child in America. They have opened our borders and are pushing for a world war
[1:38:24.600 --> 1:38:31.680]  with a thriving nuclear power, while destroying our military from within. The Biden administration's
[1:38:31.680 --> 1:38:39.680]  plan is clear, destroy America from within. And they have amassed an army of the miserable
[1:38:39.680 --> 1:38:47.520]  through mass psychosis, an army of ugly, insane, sexually obsessed deviants who want abortion
[1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:54.680]  on demand and acceptance for pedophiles, psychotics who castrate their own children because it's
[1:38:54.680 --> 1:39:01.440]  trendy, and mindless drones who believe the human race needs to die. At what point will
[1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:07.600]  Americans begin to care enough to work together and do something when the nuclear bomb start
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:13.960]  falling? America is being mass murdered by our own federal government, and the emerging
[1:39:13.960 --> 1:39:20.760]  new globalized economy will let it happen. Unless Americans take back control of their
[1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:30.320]  own government, America will soon end. That's the plan being executed right now. For Infowars,
[1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:40.320]  this is Greg Rees.
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:40:02.080]  It's all going down. Wow. I am so torn right now. I know he means well, but he really screwed
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:12.080]  you. I want him to get in their face. I want to see the reaction, but I've also got concerns.
[1:40:12.080 --> 1:40:16.320]  Nothing we can do will help focus that in a large discussion. So I promise you this.
[1:40:16.320 --> 1:40:21.480]  Today is Wednesday. You better bet your bottom peso, your bottom shekel, your bottom ruble,
[1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:26.560]  your bottom pound, your bottom dollar, your bottom euro, or your inner yarn, your bottom
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:32.440]  money. That we'll be talking about this on Thursday, Friday and right through the weekend.
[1:40:32.440 --> 1:40:36.280]  And I am going to come in here on Saturday and do a big special live show for three,
[1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:41.400]  four hours with no breaks. And then I got to do it. I promise to spend time with my
[1:40:41.400 --> 1:40:45.000]  family. I'm going to take off Sunday and Monday. I'll have some great rebroadcast for you there
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:49.040]  unless something even bigger happens. I'll be in here, but the crew needs a little respite
[1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:55.640]  as well. Can't drive these horses too hard, myself included. So that's coming up. But
[1:40:55.640 --> 1:41:00.440]  we're going to be taking your phone call start of the next segment. We're going to be talking
[1:41:00.440 --> 1:41:05.080]  to Adam and honey and Joel and Sally and Dave and Matt and Brandon and James and Liberty
[1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:10.560]  and Neil and everybody else. And then right in the next hour with Alex Stein, he'll understand
[1:41:10.560 --> 1:41:14.840]  he'll ride shotgun with us, but he's been doing some great things as well. And as the
[1:41:14.840 --> 1:41:20.120]  left really coming after him, but I'm going to remind you that we have this big July fourth
[1:41:20.120 --> 1:41:28.600]  special running right now as low as 75% off on products that are amazing that those products
[1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:35.760]  being sold at 75% off are below cost. I got to get the money in here. We got huge donations
[1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:39.360]  a few months ago that I thought would put us way into black. We had such big bills and
[1:41:39.360 --> 1:41:45.800]  problems that we would be done. If I sold everything I had, we'd be we'd be laying half
[1:41:45.800 --> 1:41:50.120]  the crew off right now and imploding. But thanks to that donor and thanks to all of you, because
[1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:55.040]  all the little donations and purchases worked as well. We'd be screwed. And I don't, I've
[1:41:55.040 --> 1:42:00.040]  learned how God works. If I don't fight as hard as I can, then right when I'm down to
[1:42:00.040 --> 1:42:05.240]  nothing, God won't come through because God's like, well, you didn't put 110% in it son.
[1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:09.600]  So that's why God always waits the last moment. God trusted in you. He trusted me to do the
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:13.240]  right thing. And then if you take action, God will bless us. He goes back to the widows
[1:42:13.240 --> 1:42:18.560]  might. So we have 40% off knockout, sleep support, alpha power, living defense plus
[1:42:18.560 --> 1:42:23.040]  whole food, multivitamin, pollen blocks or valve shield x2, all Dr. Jones natural products

[1:42:28.120 --> 1:42:31.560]  krill oil. That's that cost by the way with the krill oil. That's the highest grade. What
[1:42:31.560 --> 1:42:35.760]  does your body, your heart, your mind, everybody should be on it. It's the highest grade. Lung
[1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:40.160]  cleanse plus physio magnesium, prostagard, ultimate fish oils, excellent vasobites, all

[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:07.200]  in 1791. The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press.
[1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:13.440]  Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference
[1:45:13.440 --> 1:45:19.960]  and restraint by the government. 231 years later, free speech across America is under
[1:45:19.960 --> 1:45:26.680]  chronic and insidious attack. GCN is under attack. Your freedom is currently under siege

[1:47:24.920 --> 1:47:30.800]  Let's go ahead and talk to Adam in Texas.
[1:47:30.800 --> 1:47:31.800]  Adam, you're on the air.
[1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:32.800]  Go ahead.
[1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:33.800]  How's it going, Alex?
[1:47:33.800 --> 1:47:34.800]  Good, Brian.
[1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:40.640]  I know that thank you isn't as strong without a handshake and eye contact, but I appreciate
[1:47:40.640 --> 1:47:41.640]  everything you've done.
[1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:46.000]  I've been listening to you since you were first on Coast to Coast, and I think I've
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:49.280]  been taking X2 and some of the other products since your first time.
[1:47:49.280 --> 1:47:51.120]  Thanks for keeping us on air, brother.
[1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:52.400]  I appreciate you, Adam.
[1:47:52.400 --> 1:47:57.160]  So what do you make of Trump set to announce Monday, 2024 run?
[1:47:57.160 --> 1:48:03.120]  Well, I tried to be quick on calling you so that I would be first, because I've got to
[1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:09.400]  say it's obviously, like y'all said, it's his only play in this particular moment, you
[1:48:09.400 --> 1:48:14.440]  know, to stop kind of this puppet kangaroo court stuff going on.
[1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:18.160]  It's definitely his strongest play.
[1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:26.400]  I'm going to be honest, I think America needs to decide before anything like him running
[1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:32.120]  what our next actual president, who they need to be, because this is the most important
[1:48:32.120 --> 1:48:35.000]  decision really of the future of our country.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:37.520]  We cannot afford to be wrong again.
[1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:41.880]  And though I would take Trump over almost anyone who has been president in the last
[1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:48.120]  20-something years and probably even farther back, we need someone who really understands
[1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:55.640]  the war game and the problems that these people are going to bring to him once.
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:49:01.000]  And if we get a good president and it's going to be, you know, it's going to be the attacks
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:07.320]  as they went on Trump first, then it's going to be that all out until whatever comes down
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:11.200]  the pike next, it's going to be real rough.
[1:49:11.200 --> 1:49:12.200]  You're right, brother.
[1:49:12.200 --> 1:49:13.200]  I hear you.
[1:49:13.200 --> 1:49:14.200]  And God bless you, Adam.
[1:49:14.200 --> 1:49:15.920]  Let's talk to Liberty in Texas.
[1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:20.040]  President announcement of Trump 2024 run July 4th is the inside word.
[1:49:20.040 --> 1:49:25.360]  He may change it via a tactical flexibility, but currently Trump will announce next Monday
[1:49:25.360 --> 1:49:26.760]  his 2024 run.
[1:49:26.760 --> 1:49:28.920]  Liberty, what do you make of this exclusive news?
[1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:32.920]  Hey, Alex, I really appreciate everything you've done.
[1:49:32.920 --> 1:49:33.920]  You woke me up.
[1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:34.920]  You're doing a great job.
[1:49:34.920 --> 1:49:35.920]  My partner goes out there.
[1:49:35.920 --> 1:49:36.920]  I appreciate everything you've done.
[1:49:36.920 --> 1:49:37.920]  I appreciate you.
[1:49:37.920 --> 1:49:38.920]  Your phone's a little muddy.
[1:49:38.920 --> 1:49:40.920]  Get up close to that receiver.
[1:49:40.920 --> 1:49:45.920]  Yeah, Alex, man, I'm not too keen on Trump.
[1:49:45.920 --> 1:49:50.920]  I'm more of a dissentist or NTG, and I think he would be the best choice.
[1:49:50.920 --> 1:49:57.920]  Him being pro-vaccine is just not, you know, set well with me and on a lot of other listeners.
[1:49:57.920 --> 1:49:59.920]  But I just think it's a bad choice.
[1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:05.920]  But in the room and dissent list or someone else, probably a better choice, I would think.
[1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:10.320]  That's why I wanted your view on this, but you see how them putting them under pressure
[1:50:10.320 --> 1:50:12.920]  and doing this would push them into it.
[1:50:12.920 --> 1:50:15.320]  So why do they want to push Trump into doing this?
[1:50:15.320 --> 1:50:20.320]  Because I believe, like the other callers said, it's probably needs best planning and,
[1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:26.320]  you know, the Roger O'Kill's in the same way, and we'll see how time goes out.
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:28.320]  But I personally will be voting for him.
[1:50:28.320 --> 1:50:29.320]  And God bless, Alex.
[1:50:29.320 --> 1:50:31.320]  God bless you, Liberty.
[1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:32.320]  Thank you so much, sir.
[1:50:32.320 --> 1:50:34.320]  Let's talk to a caller in North Carolina.
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:35.320]  Let's talk to Neil.
[1:50:35.320 --> 1:50:36.320]  Neil, thanks for calling.
[1:50:36.320 --> 1:50:37.320]  Go ahead.
[1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:39.320]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[1:50:39.320 --> 1:50:44.320]  Hey, first of all, I'd like to say that no one would like to see Trump declare faster
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:51.320]  than the media because it will boost their ratings skyrocketing again.
[1:50:51.320 --> 1:50:55.320]  Secondly, it's a two-edged sword if he runs again.
[1:50:55.320 --> 1:51:00.320]  In a positive manner, he can illuminate the positive things that he did and the negative
[1:51:00.320 --> 1:51:04.320]  things that are happening because of what Biden has done.
[1:51:04.320 --> 1:51:05.320]  That's right.
[1:51:05.320 --> 1:51:08.320]  It'll give him a bully pulpit no matter what they do to destroy Biden.
[1:51:08.320 --> 1:51:09.320]  Yeah, that's why I love it.
[1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:10.320]  Yep.
[1:51:10.320 --> 1:51:18.320]  I think on the flip side, they could just hammer him so hard that they can just distract from
[1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:22.320]  what's going on in the country with the border and inflation and stuff like that.
[1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:26.320]  So it's a two-headed snake.
[1:51:26.320 --> 1:51:29.320]  Sure, you're talking about how divisive he is.
[1:51:29.320 --> 1:51:31.320]  That's the downside, is it'll energize the left.
[1:51:31.320 --> 1:51:35.320]  Just like for the midterms, Roe v. Wade energizes the left.
[1:51:35.320 --> 1:51:37.320]  Trump will energize the left.
[1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:44.320]  Well, I think that he will energize the left, but I think the middle of the country, the
[1:51:44.320 --> 1:51:48.320]  people that are suffering, paying $100 to fill up their car for gas, they're seeing these
[1:51:48.320 --> 1:51:53.320]  people coming in flooding over the border, inflation on everything else that they're
[1:51:53.320 --> 1:51:57.320]  buying, I think that's been overwhelming just like it overwhelmed Jimmy Carter.
[1:51:57.320 --> 1:52:01.320]  And you might see Trump win 45 or 50 states.
[1:52:01.320 --> 1:52:03.320]  I agree with you, Neil.
[1:52:03.320 --> 1:52:04.320]  Crazy time to be alive.
[1:52:04.320 --> 1:52:05.320]  Thank you, sir.
[1:52:05.320 --> 1:52:07.320]  Welcome to James in Ohio.
[1:52:07.320 --> 1:52:08.320]  James, you're on here.
[1:52:08.320 --> 1:52:09.320]  Hey, Alex.
[1:52:09.320 --> 1:52:10.320]  God bless you, brother.
[1:52:10.320 --> 1:52:13.320]  What do you think is about to go down?
[1:52:13.320 --> 1:52:14.320]  What's your view on this?
[1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:19.320]  Well, as a former Trump staffer, Alex, I was actually a guest on your show a few years
[1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:20.320]  ago.
[1:52:20.320 --> 1:52:26.320]  I think you've got to announce as soon as possible just to get the wolves away from his
[1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:29.320]  door, but he has to do one thing that's critical and you've said it.
[1:52:29.320 --> 1:52:33.320]  He has to come out and lay out the case against the vaccine.
[1:52:33.320 --> 1:52:39.320]  I mean, his number one most resilient trait is that he never accepts guilt, that he doesn't
[1:52:39.320 --> 1:52:40.320]  listen to the attacks.
[1:52:40.320 --> 1:52:42.320]  He just denies, denies, denies.
[1:52:42.320 --> 1:52:48.320]  It would be so impactful if he just came out, filmed a long form video and said, laid
[1:52:48.320 --> 1:52:51.320]  out the evidence, said, hey, I was, I was fooled on this.
[1:52:51.320 --> 1:52:52.320]  This is my one big mistake.
[1:52:52.320 --> 1:52:55.320]  And put it out of the Democrats and put it on the Fauci, exactly.
[1:52:55.320 --> 1:52:56.320]  Oh, yeah.
[1:52:56.320 --> 1:52:57.320]  Throw Fauci under the bus.
[1:52:57.320 --> 1:52:58.320]  Throw the Democrats up.
[1:52:58.320 --> 1:53:00.320]  Throw Big Pharma under the bus.
[1:53:00.320 --> 1:53:04.720]  I mean, that would be, look, Ross Perot in the early nineties, they wouldn't, they wouldn't
[1:53:04.720 --> 1:53:05.720]  give him any publicity.
[1:53:05.720 --> 1:53:09.320]  So he bought airtime on networks and local market.
[1:53:09.320 --> 1:53:11.320]  Trump could very easily do that.
[1:53:11.320 --> 1:53:15.320]  Still, he did infomercials, film an hour long infomercial just laying out the case against
[1:53:15.320 --> 1:53:16.320]  the vaccine.
[1:53:16.320 --> 1:53:18.320]  And by the way, does Perot infomercials have the highest ratings ever?
[1:53:18.320 --> 1:53:19.320]  Right.
[1:53:19.320 --> 1:53:22.320]  And if I was in the room with Trump, which I've been in the room with Trump, I would,
[1:53:22.320 --> 1:53:27.320]  somebody needs to lay this out to him and quit just being yes men and saying, yes, the
[1:53:27.320 --> 1:53:30.320]  full speed was great.
[1:53:30.320 --> 1:53:31.320]  We're so proud of you.
[1:53:31.320 --> 1:53:32.320]  It was a funny moment for me.
[1:53:32.320 --> 1:53:33.320]  No, it wasn't.
[1:53:33.320 --> 1:53:36.320]  Mr. Trump, you have to write this wrong if you want to win.
[1:53:36.320 --> 1:53:38.320]  I mean, there's issues with the Santas too.
[1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:40.320]  I'm tired of, let's take the bloom off the road there.
[1:53:40.320 --> 1:53:41.320]  There's red flag laws in Florida.
[1:53:41.320 --> 1:53:42.320]  He does.
[1:53:42.320 --> 1:53:44.320]  He does nothing to stop them.
[1:53:44.320 --> 1:53:46.320]  Do we know anything about his foreign policy?
[1:53:46.320 --> 1:53:50.320]  He's given indications that he might be a hawk or even a neocon.
[1:53:50.320 --> 1:53:53.320]  So I need to hear more from, from Ron before.
[1:53:53.320 --> 1:53:58.320]  I appreciate you, Sally in New York, you're on the air.
[1:53:58.320 --> 1:54:00.320]  Welcome, Alex.
[1:54:00.320 --> 1:54:01.320]  God bless you, brother.
[1:54:01.320 --> 1:54:02.320]  And I love you, man.
[1:54:02.320 --> 1:54:04.320]  I've been waiting over 20 years to talk to you, brother.
[1:54:04.320 --> 1:54:05.320]  Good talk to you.
[1:54:05.320 --> 1:54:10.320]  What a, what a topic to bring up because July 4th just happened to be my birthday.
[1:54:10.320 --> 1:54:16.320]  So I am in for Trump running because basically Trump won in this last election.
[1:54:16.320 --> 1:54:17.320]  We all know that.
[1:54:17.320 --> 1:54:22.320]  However, the one thing that I want to see Alex and I'm sure that you and, um, you
[1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:27.320]  know, I listen to your show every single day and I think the most important thing is who
[1:54:27.320 --> 1:54:30.320]  is Trump going to have on his staff?
[1:54:30.320 --> 1:54:34.320]  What is his administration going to look like this time?
[1:54:34.320 --> 1:54:41.320]  Is he going to pull on another, a bunch of wolves and, you know, in sheep's, in sheep's
[1:54:41.320 --> 1:54:42.320]  uniforms or what?
[1:54:42.320 --> 1:54:43.320]  But that's the only thing I worry about.
[1:54:43.320 --> 1:54:47.320]  Is he going to surround himself with the enemy again?
[1:54:47.320 --> 1:54:54.320]  That's the most important question is he's really needs to come out and say, I won't
[1:54:54.320 --> 1:54:56.320]  make the same mistakes I made before.
[1:54:56.320 --> 1:54:57.320]  That's, you know what?
[1:54:57.320 --> 1:55:01.320]  I think he won't make as many mistakes, but who knows, brother?
[1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:02.320]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:55:02.320 --> 1:55:08.320]  And I truly believe that he is going to take what he learned from the first four years.
[1:55:08.320 --> 1:55:12.320]  And I think that there's going to be a lot of people that are going to very, very much
[1:55:12.320 --> 1:55:13.320]  protect him.
[1:55:13.320 --> 1:55:17.320]  And they're going to put him to the, they're going to put him to the burner and say, listen,
[1:55:17.320 --> 1:55:18.320]  you made these mistakes.
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:21.320]  We can't make these mistakes anymore.
[1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:23.320]  They're definitely scared of Trump for a reason.
[1:55:23.320 --> 1:55:24.320]  Thank you so much.
[1:55:24.320 --> 1:55:25.320]  He energizes the people.
[1:55:25.320 --> 1:55:26.320]  I'll say another call.
[1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:27.320]  We're getting a lot of calls in.
[1:55:27.320 --> 1:55:29.320]  Let's talk to Dave in California.
[1:55:29.320 --> 1:55:30.320]  Dave, thanks for calling.
[1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:34.320]  What do you think of this situation inside Intel directly from a conversation with Trump?
[1:55:34.320 --> 1:55:36.320]  He's planning to announce July 4th.
[1:55:36.320 --> 1:55:37.320]  Hey, Alex.
[1:55:37.320 --> 1:55:39.320]  Thanks for having me on.
[1:55:39.320 --> 1:55:43.320]  I think you can go both, I think go two ways.
[1:55:43.320 --> 1:55:45.320]  So there's lines being drawn in the sand.
[1:55:45.320 --> 1:55:47.320]  The American people see what's going on.
[1:55:47.320 --> 1:55:48.320]  They see the guys' prices.
[1:55:48.320 --> 1:55:49.320]  They see the border.
[1:55:49.320 --> 1:55:55.320]  They see what's going on and their pocketbooks are being affected.
[1:55:55.320 --> 1:56:02.320]  But I think, I think it's going to get to a point where the left is not going to have
[1:56:02.320 --> 1:56:05.320]  a choice, but to do something drastic.
[1:56:05.320 --> 1:56:08.320]  And I think that may be a blackout nationwide.
[1:56:08.320 --> 1:56:16.320]  I think they may do something to inhibit the progression moving forward by doing something
[1:56:16.320 --> 1:56:22.320]  along the lines of an attack like that, by preventing everything they've worked for to
[1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:24.320]  kind of be crumbled.
[1:56:24.320 --> 1:56:26.320]  You there?
[1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:27.320]  No, I'm listening to you.
[1:56:27.320 --> 1:56:29.320]  In fact, what you're saying is so true.
[1:56:29.320 --> 1:56:30.320]  They'll launch a war.
[1:56:30.320 --> 1:56:32.320]  They'll do a hack attack.
[1:56:32.320 --> 1:56:33.320]  They'll do a blackout.
[1:56:33.320 --> 1:56:34.320]  You're totally right.
[1:56:34.320 --> 1:56:36.320]  But yeah, real quick, though.
[1:56:36.320 --> 1:56:39.320]  The reason why I say that is because Trump's too easy.
[1:56:39.320 --> 1:56:41.320]  They've already established all these things against Trump.
[1:56:41.320 --> 1:56:43.320]  They can't do that with another candidate.
[1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:45.320]  It would seem too disingenuous.
[1:56:45.320 --> 1:56:50.320]  So I agree with the previous call about Ron DeSantis supporting red gun laws, like red
[1:56:50.320 --> 1:56:51.320]  flag laws.
[1:56:51.320 --> 1:56:53.320]  That's not ideal for us.
[1:56:53.320 --> 1:56:57.320]  So I think Trump will get into position, he'll run, and maybe before or maybe a little
[1:56:57.320 --> 1:57:02.320]  bit after, they'll bring in some kind of Russian, blah, blah, blah hoax, whatever it is, cut
[1:57:02.320 --> 1:57:08.320]  off, and basically kind of do that, what they've been talking about, the reset, basically,
[1:57:08.320 --> 1:57:12.320]  and introduce their cryptocurrencies, introduce the CBDCs.
[1:57:12.320 --> 1:57:15.320]  And if you have dollars, it's going to be useless.
[1:57:15.320 --> 1:57:17.320]  You know, you're right.
[1:57:17.320 --> 1:57:21.320]  The globalists have no limit to what they'll do to maintain control.
[1:57:21.320 --> 1:57:23.320]  Hour number three coming up.
[1:57:23.320 --> 1:57:25.320]  Everybody stays with us.
[1:57:25.320 --> 1:57:29.320]  Matt, Brandon, Joel, honey, we'll get involved.
[1:57:29.320 --> 1:57:34.320]  We'll get to all these callers that are holding, and that's it for calls, though.
[1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:40.320]  We'll intersperse your calls while Alex Stein is our guest straight ahead.
[1:57:40.320 --> 1:57:47.320]  Third hour, stay with us.
[1:57:47.320 --> 1:57:52.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 30 months, we've witnessed the globalists hit humanity
[1:57:52.320 --> 1:57:55.320]  and hit humanity extremely hard.
[1:57:55.320 --> 1:58:01.320]  This is beyond critical that everyone listening to the sound of my voice, protect yourselves
[1:58:01.320 --> 1:58:05.320]  and your families to the greatest extent possible, and these two new sales do that.
[1:58:05.320 --> 1:58:10.320]  We have the ultimate immune support, 60% off when you get these four items together.

[1:58:15.320 --> 1:58:18.320]  The immune support formula is incredible by itself.
[1:58:18.320 --> 1:58:21.320]  These other three together, it is amazing.
[1:58:21.320 --> 1:58:22.320]  60% off.
[1:58:22.320 --> 1:58:28.320]  It's perfect to immune support, 50% off on immune support, X2, and D3 gummies,

[1:58:33.320 --> 1:58:37.320]  Now, just the X2 alone is the missing link with most people.

[1:58:42.320 --> 1:58:47.320]  It's 40% off back in stock, but get four of the products together for 60% off.
[1:58:47.320 --> 1:58:53.320]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all.
[1:58:53.320 --> 1:58:57.320]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[1:58:57.320 --> 1:59:02.320]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare.
[1:59:02.320 --> 1:59:05.320]  And that alone is something to be grateful for.
[1:59:05.320 --> 1:59:09.320]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water,
[1:59:09.320 --> 1:59:13.320]  even in the event of your taps getting shut off.
[1:59:13.320 --> 1:59:19.320]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[1:59:19.320 --> 1:59:22.320]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family,
[1:59:22.320 --> 1:59:26.320]  you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[1:59:26.320 --> 1:59:30.320]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming,
[1:59:30.320 --> 1:59:36.320]  but you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[1:59:36.320 --> 1:59:41.320]  Whoever sews bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[1:59:41.320 --> 1:59:46.320]  Stock up now at PrepareToday.com.
[2:00:11.320 --> 2:00:13.320]  It's going to be our guest.
[2:00:13.320 --> 2:00:16.320]  So look for that in your phone calls coming up.
[2:00:16.320 --> 2:00:42.320]  Here's some what happened in New York just a few days ago.
[2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:47.320]  Look at this. You see this? You see this? You see this?
[2:00:47.320 --> 2:00:50.320]  Ah! Let's go, baby!
[2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:53.320]  Look at this, my very own protestor.
[2:00:53.320 --> 2:00:56.320]  Proton 99. I made it on the drive!
[2:00:56.320 --> 2:00:58.320]  This is all in stock.
[2:00:58.320 --> 2:01:00.320]  Thank you guys for coming to the show.
[2:01:00.320 --> 2:01:03.320]  Thank you all so much. I really appreciate your support.
[2:01:03.320 --> 2:01:07.320]  We did it, guys! This is the real strong Proton 99!
[2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:12.320]  This is how we win the culture war.
[2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:15.320]  This is how we do it, guys.
[2:01:15.320 --> 2:01:19.320]  This is when you know it's effective, when people come out here and protest you.
[2:01:19.320 --> 2:01:22.320]  That's because these people love the establishment.
[2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:24.320]  We are the anti-establishment.
[2:01:24.320 --> 2:01:26.320]  We are the counter culture.
[2:01:26.320 --> 2:01:28.320]  These guys defend, they call me a fascist.
[2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:30.320]  They're the fascists.
[2:01:30.320 --> 2:01:35.320]  The definition of fascism is a merger of corporations and states.
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:39.320]  Hey, ho! Pratt Time has got you, so hey, hey!
[2:01:39.320 --> 2:01:43.320]  Ho-ho! Pratt Time has got you, so hey, hey!
[2:01:43.320 --> 2:01:46.320]  Ho-ho! Pratt Time has got you, so look at this.
[2:01:46.320 --> 2:01:50.320]  This is how they did it, so it's Archie Cratt Time for Antifa tonight.
[2:01:50.320 --> 2:01:52.320]  I love it.
[2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:54.320]  This is Archie Cratt's.
[2:01:54.320 --> 2:01:55.320]  Where did you all go to?
[2:01:55.320 --> 2:01:57.320]  Joe has fabrics and get designs.
[2:01:57.320 --> 2:01:59.320]  Look at this. This is how you know you're winning.
[2:01:59.320 --> 2:02:01.320]  I love it.
[2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:05.320]  This is a Joanne's fabric. What in the world are you?
[2:02:05.320 --> 2:02:07.320]  You don't buy boxes like that.
[2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:09.320]  But I want to say, I love you all.
[2:02:09.320 --> 2:02:12.320]  I know you guys don't like me, but I love each and every one of you.
[2:02:12.320 --> 2:02:14.320]  Stick when you know where it sucks.
[2:02:14.320 --> 2:02:16.320]  What the f**k was I saying?
[2:02:16.320 --> 2:02:17.320]  I love you guys.
[2:02:17.320 --> 2:02:19.320]  With your moccasins, you idiot.
[2:02:19.320 --> 2:02:21.320]  Look at these f**king feet.
[2:02:21.320 --> 2:02:23.320]  Wow, feet line!
[2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:25.320]  I really appreciate this.
[2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:27.320]  Hey, I'm Alec Sine, Alec Sine 99 on Twitter.
[2:02:27.320 --> 2:02:29.320]  No, but seriously, look at this.
[2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:32.320]  I love drag, guys. I'm gender fluid.
[2:02:32.320 --> 2:02:34.320]  But for a little bit, I'm back on.
[2:02:34.320 --> 2:02:36.320]  But I'm just saying, I love you.
[2:02:36.320 --> 2:02:37.320]  You get to get by with John.
[2:02:37.320 --> 2:02:38.320]  I love you.
[2:02:38.320 --> 2:02:39.320]  I hope you choke on a dick.
[2:02:39.320 --> 2:02:41.320]  I love you, though.
[2:02:41.320 --> 2:02:43.320]  I hope you choke on a trans girl dick.
[2:02:43.320 --> 2:02:45.320]  Wow, I hope you choke on a trans girl dick.
[2:02:45.320 --> 2:02:47.320]  Trans girl dick?
[2:02:47.320 --> 2:02:49.320]  Wow, that's sweet.
[2:02:49.320 --> 2:02:51.320]  I want you to live a long, prosperous life.
[2:02:51.320 --> 2:02:53.320]  Yeah, and I hope you die.
[2:02:53.320 --> 2:02:55.320]  That's what they want me to do, Joe.
[2:02:55.320 --> 2:02:57.320]  Shonde for the podium.
[2:02:57.320 --> 2:02:59.320]  I don't even know what that quite means,
[2:02:59.320 --> 2:03:01.320]  but I know that you're a good person.
[2:03:01.320 --> 2:03:03.320]  I love you. Not to you.
[2:03:03.320 --> 2:03:05.320]  Not to you. Not to you.
[2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:07.320]  You're within my personal space,
[2:03:07.320 --> 2:03:09.320]  and I'm willing to ground the New York State law
[2:03:09.320 --> 2:03:11.320]  to actually push you away.
[2:03:11.320 --> 2:03:13.320]  Okay, well, I'm just saying, I'm a fan of yours.
[2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:15.320]  Please move away before I...
[2:03:15.320 --> 2:03:17.320]  These people are under. They have mental issues, guys.
[2:03:17.320 --> 2:03:19.320]  These people are in anti-depressants.
[2:03:19.320 --> 2:03:21.320]  These guys have horrible mental issues.
[2:03:21.320 --> 2:03:23.320]  That's why they come out here and do this.
[2:03:23.320 --> 2:03:25.320]  And you know what? I love it.
[2:03:25.320 --> 2:03:27.320]  Guys, come out here and do whatever I want.
[2:03:27.320 --> 2:03:29.320]  Look at that.
[2:03:29.320 --> 2:03:31.320]  Einstein!
[2:03:31.320 --> 2:03:33.320]  This is the best.
[2:03:33.320 --> 2:03:35.320]  Dude, come on, dude.
[2:03:35.320 --> 2:03:37.320]  Say hey.
[2:03:37.320 --> 2:03:39.320]  I'm a little disappointed there wasn't sign earlier
[2:03:39.320 --> 2:03:41.320]  with my name on it here.
[2:03:41.320 --> 2:03:43.320]  All right, guys, we got to go.
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:45.320]  I love you guys. Keep following me on Twitter.
[2:03:45.320 --> 2:03:47.320]  You guys are the best. Thank you so much.
[2:03:47.320 --> 2:03:49.320]  Arts, crafts, and teeth.
[2:03:49.320 --> 2:03:51.320]  Arts and crafts, and teeth.
[2:03:51.320 --> 2:03:53.320]  Arts and crafts, and teeth.
[2:03:53.320 --> 2:03:55.320]  Arts and crafts, and teeth.
[2:03:55.320 --> 2:03:57.320]  I love you guys. You guys are awesome.
[2:03:57.320 --> 2:03:59.320]  I love you. I love you.
[2:03:59.320 --> 2:04:01.320]  I can just come out here and do whatever I want.
[2:04:01.320 --> 2:04:03.320]  Look at that.
[2:04:03.320 --> 2:04:05.320]  Einstein!
[2:04:05.320 --> 2:04:07.320]  This is the best.
[2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:09.320]  Dude, come on, dude.
[2:04:09.320 --> 2:04:11.320]  Say hey.
[2:04:11.320 --> 2:04:13.320]  I'm a little disappointed there wasn't sign.
[2:04:15.320 --> 2:04:17.320]  All right, guys, we got to go.
[2:04:17.320 --> 2:04:19.320]  I love you guys. Keep following me on Twitter.
[2:04:19.320 --> 2:04:21.320]  You guys are the best.
[2:04:21.320 --> 2:04:23.320]  Everyone, arts, crafts, and teeth.
[2:04:23.320 --> 2:04:25.320]  Arts and crafts, and teeth.
[2:04:25.320 --> 2:04:27.320]  Arts and crafts, and teeth.
[2:04:27.320 --> 2:04:29.320]  Arts and crafts, and teeth.
[2:04:29.320 --> 2:04:31.320]  I love you guys. You guys are awesome.
[2:04:31.320 --> 2:04:33.320]  I love you. I love you.
[2:04:33.320 --> 2:04:35.320]  I love you.
[2:04:35.320 --> 2:04:37.320]  This is your sign.
[2:04:37.320 --> 2:04:39.320]  Hey, I'm going to get this.
[2:04:39.320 --> 2:04:41.320]  Oh, so scary.
[2:04:41.320 --> 2:04:43.320]  Oh, I'm so scared.
[2:04:43.320 --> 2:04:45.320]  This is what I think about their signs, guys.
[2:04:45.320 --> 2:04:47.320]  This is crap.
[2:04:47.320 --> 2:04:49.320]  Oh, we're so scared.
[2:04:49.320 --> 2:04:51.320]  Proud Time 99 is on the ground.
[2:04:51.320 --> 2:04:53.320]  These are wins. Look at this.
[2:04:53.320 --> 2:04:55.320]  You see this? You see this?
[2:04:55.320 --> 2:04:57.320]  You see this?
[2:04:57.320 --> 2:05:20.320]  The Internet and Talk Radio are on fire with the slogan,
[2:05:20.320 --> 2:05:29.320]  The Builderburg Group founded Davos Group.
[2:05:29.320 --> 2:05:32.320]  So now, the fight's out in the open.
[2:05:32.320 --> 2:05:35.320]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[2:05:35.320 --> 2:05:37.320]  We're going to win this thing.
[2:05:37.320 --> 2:05:39.320]  God's watching. The children are counting on us.
[2:05:39.320 --> 2:05:41.320]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth
[2:05:41.320 --> 2:05:43.320]  and your prayer and your financial support,
[2:05:43.320 --> 2:05:46.320]  because without you, Info Wars would not be here.
[2:05:46.320 --> 2:05:49.320]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the Info War,
[2:05:49.320 --> 2:05:52.320]  and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[2:05:52.320 --> 2:05:55.320]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done
[2:05:55.320 --> 2:05:58.320]  and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[2:05:58.320 --> 2:06:01.320]  Frontlines of the Information War.
[2:06:01.320 --> 2:06:03.320]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:13.320 --> 2:06:16.320]  It's me, Proud Time 99, and Ross Dabon.
[2:06:16.320 --> 2:06:17.320]  What up, baby?
[2:06:17.320 --> 2:06:19.320]  And we're here at Washington Square Park
[2:06:19.320 --> 2:06:21.320]  asking people all about pride,
[2:06:21.320 --> 2:06:24.320]  why they're here, what they're celebrating, having a good time.
[2:06:24.320 --> 2:06:26.320]  Let's go get it, baby girl.
[2:06:32.320 --> 2:06:34.320]  Dude, this place is insane.
[2:06:34.320 --> 2:06:39.320]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, and more yes.
[2:06:39.320 --> 2:06:41.320]  Are you a pony or a person?
[2:06:41.320 --> 2:06:43.320]  I don't give a shit about your mind.
[2:06:43.320 --> 2:06:48.320]  Are there people swimming in it?
[2:06:48.320 --> 2:06:52.320]  My name is Star with two R's, two R's, two R's.
[2:06:52.320 --> 2:06:54.320]  Are you in favor of my body, my choice?
[2:06:54.320 --> 2:06:56.320]  My body, my choice.
[2:06:56.320 --> 2:06:57.320]  Your body, my choice.
[2:06:57.320 --> 2:06:59.320]  Why live in Connecticut?
[2:06:59.320 --> 2:07:02.320]  And my governor said it's still our fucking choice.
[2:07:02.320 --> 2:07:03.320]  All the nips are out too.
[2:07:03.320 --> 2:07:06.320]  Sun's out, hun's out, honey bun's all over.
[2:07:06.320 --> 2:07:08.320]  I gotta walk up with the energy.
[2:07:08.320 --> 2:07:10.320]  I gotta walk up with the energy. You ready?
[2:07:10.320 --> 2:07:12.320]  Yes, this is the fun corner.
[2:07:12.320 --> 2:07:16.320]  Dude, turn up, turn up.
[2:07:16.320 --> 2:07:17.320]  You're queen, I'm loving it.
[2:07:17.320 --> 2:07:18.320]  So let me ask you a question.
[2:07:18.320 --> 2:07:20.320]  Do you have the best booty out here?
[2:07:20.320 --> 2:07:21.320]  Do you think?
[2:07:21.320 --> 2:07:22.320]  No.
[2:07:22.320 --> 2:07:24.320]  I mean, it's great.
[2:07:24.320 --> 2:07:25.320]  It's fantastical.
[2:07:25.320 --> 2:07:28.320]  I mean, never been done before, never been seen before.
[2:07:28.320 --> 2:07:30.320]  Okay, let me ask everybody a question.
[2:07:30.320 --> 2:07:31.320]  Now that we're all out here together
[2:07:31.320 --> 2:07:32.320]  and we're having fun together,
[2:07:32.320 --> 2:07:34.320]  do we kind of think, since none of us are wearing masks,
[2:07:34.320 --> 2:07:37.320]  that maybe it was a little bit bullshit?
[2:07:37.320 --> 2:07:38.320]  A little bit.
[2:07:38.320 --> 2:07:39.320]  A little bit.
[2:07:39.320 --> 2:07:40.320]  She told the truth.
[2:07:40.320 --> 2:07:43.320]  Everybody else thinks that when no one's looking though, right?
[2:07:43.320 --> 2:07:44.320]  I'm getting controversial.
[2:07:44.320 --> 2:07:45.320]  This is controversial.
[2:07:45.320 --> 2:07:46.320]  So some people, though,
[2:07:46.320 --> 2:07:48.320]  come on, who cares about controversy, girl?
[2:07:53.320 --> 2:07:56.320]  Are you in favor of My Body, My Choice?
[2:07:56.320 --> 2:07:57.320]  Yes, of course.
[2:07:57.320 --> 2:07:58.320]  My Body, My Choice.
[2:07:58.320 --> 2:07:59.320]  Okay, awesome.
[2:07:59.320 --> 2:08:00.320]  Let me ask you guys a question.
[2:08:00.320 --> 2:08:02.320]  My Body, My Choice, right?
[2:08:02.320 --> 2:08:03.320]  Yes.
[2:08:03.320 --> 2:08:04.320]  Yes.
[2:08:04.320 --> 2:08:05.320]  Okay.
[2:08:05.320 --> 2:08:09.320]  What about for vaccine mandates?
[2:08:09.320 --> 2:08:11.320]  My Body, My Choice, they just said it.
[2:08:11.320 --> 2:08:13.320]  Believe in for vaccine mandates, right?
[2:08:13.320 --> 2:08:16.320]  If you don't want it, I don't want it.
[2:08:16.320 --> 2:08:17.320]  I don't know why.
[2:08:17.320 --> 2:08:18.320]  It depends.
[2:08:18.320 --> 2:08:19.320]  It depends.
[2:08:19.320 --> 2:08:20.320]  Oh, the tower's falling.
[2:08:20.320 --> 2:08:21.320]  Come on, say no.
[2:08:21.320 --> 2:08:23.320]  No, if you don't want it, you don't have to have it.
[2:08:23.320 --> 2:08:24.320]  Okay, fair enough.
[2:08:24.320 --> 2:08:26.320]  All right, freedom.
[2:08:26.320 --> 2:08:28.320]  Let's go, bitches.
[2:08:28.320 --> 2:08:30.320]  Do you like My Body, My Choice?
[2:08:30.320 --> 2:08:31.320]  Yes.
[2:08:31.320 --> 2:08:33.320]  What about for vaccine mandates?
[2:08:33.320 --> 2:08:35.320]  Can people choose?
[2:08:35.320 --> 2:08:36.320]  Yes.
[2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:37.320]  Okay.
[2:08:37.320 --> 2:08:39.320]  Let's go.
[2:08:39.320 --> 2:08:40.320]  Anybody else?
[2:08:40.320 --> 2:08:42.320]  Anti-vax in this mug?
[2:08:42.320 --> 2:08:43.320]  What is your name?
[2:08:43.320 --> 2:08:45.320]  The real joke of it was nice to meet you.
[2:08:45.320 --> 2:08:46.320]  The real joke?
[2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:47.320]  I love it.
[2:08:47.320 --> 2:08:48.320]  So, My Body, My Choice?
[2:08:48.320 --> 2:08:50.320]  Your Body, Your Choice.
[2:08:50.320 --> 2:08:52.320]  What about for vaccine mandates?
[2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:54.320]  My Body, My Choice for vaccine mandates?
[2:08:54.320 --> 2:08:56.320]  Hey, if you don't want it, don't get it, bro.
[2:08:56.320 --> 2:08:57.320]  Oh, I love it.
[2:08:57.320 --> 2:08:59.320]  They can't tell us what to do with our bodies.
[2:08:59.320 --> 2:09:01.320]  Can't spend anything to score our bodies.
[2:09:01.320 --> 2:09:02.320]  High fives?
[2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:03.320]  Yes.
[2:09:03.320 --> 2:09:05.320]  Your Body, Your Choice, right?
[2:09:05.320 --> 2:09:07.320]  Yes.
[2:09:07.320 --> 2:09:09.320]  Even for vaccine mandates, right?
[2:09:09.320 --> 2:09:10.320]  Sure.
[2:09:10.320 --> 2:09:11.320]  Okay.
[2:09:11.320 --> 2:09:12.320]  I like it.
[2:09:12.320 --> 2:09:13.320]  Who said boo?
[2:09:13.320 --> 2:09:14.320]  Who said boo?
[2:09:14.320 --> 2:09:15.320]  I want to hear it.
[2:09:15.320 --> 2:09:16.320]  That's right.
[2:09:16.320 --> 2:09:18.320]  You shut up and keep your hands off my body.
[2:09:18.320 --> 2:09:27.320]  My Body, My Choice for vaccine mandates, too.
[2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:29.320]  I love it.
[2:09:29.320 --> 2:09:33.320]  I hope y'all keep that energy if they try some boo-boo monkey pox.
[2:09:33.320 --> 2:09:37.320]  And it means having fun, enjoying yourself, enjoying everybody, enjoying the love that
[2:09:37.320 --> 2:09:38.320]  spreads around.
[2:09:38.320 --> 2:09:42.320]  If they hate boo-boo, let your life be free and be naked.
[2:09:42.320 --> 2:09:43.320]  And be naked.
[2:09:43.320 --> 2:09:44.320]  And be naked.
[2:09:44.320 --> 2:09:53.320]  Inside the leftist mob, at least they didn't catch a bunch of kids being paraded in the
[2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:57.320]  streets with naked men like Seattle.
[2:09:57.320 --> 2:10:03.320]  Alex Stein is a comedian, he's a talk show host, his mother died last year, murdered
[2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:05.320]  by the COVID tyranny in the hospital.
[2:10:05.320 --> 2:10:10.320]  And he has been absolutely on fire, tens of millions of views a week, all over the place,
[2:10:10.320 --> 2:10:12.320]  exposing the hypocrisy.
[2:10:12.320 --> 2:10:14.320]  Congratulations to him on all of that.
[2:10:14.320 --> 2:10:19.320]  Obviously, I didn't intend to have callers during today's show, but I had to because
[2:10:19.320 --> 2:10:23.320]  Roger Stone talks to Trump, doesn't want us to brag every day.
[2:10:23.320 --> 2:10:26.320]  And he told me, you know, a year ago, yeah, Trump's not running, he's mad.
[2:10:26.320 --> 2:10:27.320]  He didn't want to run.
[2:10:27.320 --> 2:10:29.320]  Now, okay, they're messing with him, he's going to run.
[2:10:29.320 --> 2:10:31.320]  And now he's going to run.
[2:10:31.320 --> 2:10:35.320]  It looks like he's going to announce it July, probably July 4th.
[2:10:35.320 --> 2:10:37.320]  That's a huge piece of news, exclusive.
[2:10:37.320 --> 2:10:42.320]  We've now posted that video, Roger Stone, in the first hour, at infowords.com.
[2:10:42.320 --> 2:10:47.320]  And people want to see the big announcement from the guy that got Trump to run the first
[2:10:47.320 --> 2:10:54.320]  time, got him to announce for a little while, decades ago, then obviously run in 2015, 2016.
[2:10:54.320 --> 2:11:01.320]  So what is your views of Trump, Alex Stein, prime time Alex Stein, running for president
[2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:02.320]  2024?
[2:11:02.320 --> 2:11:04.320]  What's your view on that?
[2:11:04.320 --> 2:11:07.320]  Well, I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate the question because it's
[2:11:07.320 --> 2:11:08.320]  a little nuanced.
[2:11:08.320 --> 2:11:12.320]  I mean, if you look at what's happening right now in our political culture, you have Donald
[2:11:12.320 --> 2:11:13.320]  Trump, who's universally hated.
[2:11:13.320 --> 2:11:17.320]  You have the sham January 6th trial that's obviously a waste of taxpayer money.
[2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:20.320]  And we know that everything that happened on January 6th isn't close to as bad as what
[2:11:20.320 --> 2:11:24.320]  happened in the summer of love with the George Floyd riots.
[2:11:24.320 --> 2:11:26.320]  But sadly, people are dumb, Alex.
[2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:27.320]  You know this.
[2:11:27.320 --> 2:11:31.320]  So this is my only thing that worries me about Trump is there's so much baggage with Trump
[2:11:31.320 --> 2:11:33.320]  that DeSantis doesn't have.
[2:11:33.320 --> 2:11:34.320]  Now, I love Trump.
[2:11:34.320 --> 2:11:35.320]  I like eventual Trump.
[2:11:35.320 --> 2:11:38.320]  If Trump runs, I'm behind Trump 1000%.
[2:11:38.320 --> 2:11:44.320]  But these people are so dumb and they will use fake evidence against Trump that they don't
[2:11:44.320 --> 2:11:45.320]  have on DeSantis.
[2:11:45.320 --> 2:11:50.320]  So for me, I mean, I'm willing to back whoever is, you know, going to be on the conservative
[2:11:50.320 --> 2:11:55.320]  side, but I almost think Trump would be more powerful being a kingmaker than for by running
[2:11:55.320 --> 2:11:56.320]  for president.
[2:11:56.320 --> 2:12:01.320]  Personally, very smart, nuanced statement by prime time.
[2:12:01.320 --> 2:12:06.320]  Alex Stein here with us right now.
[2:12:06.320 --> 2:12:08.320]  They are pressuring Trump into this position.
[2:12:08.320 --> 2:12:09.320]  And you're absolutely right.
[2:12:09.320 --> 2:12:13.320]  They've got all this made up stuff, but they can mix them up about DeSantis.
[2:12:13.320 --> 2:12:20.320]  I'm sure you noticed it's now the secret services confirmed this testimony that he tried to
[2:12:20.320 --> 2:12:26.320]  grab the beast presidential limo wheel on January 6 and all this.
[2:12:26.320 --> 2:12:28.320]  And the letter she said was real wasn't real.
[2:12:28.320 --> 2:12:33.320]  And her saying that Trump and Meadows were calling Roger Stone and General Flynn on January
[2:12:33.320 --> 2:12:34.320]  6.
[2:12:34.320 --> 2:12:35.320]  And none of that's true.
[2:12:35.320 --> 2:12:37.320]  So I get they can make stuff up.
[2:12:37.320 --> 2:12:39.320]  But I mean, we know they do that.
[2:12:39.320 --> 2:12:43.320]  I mean, they say on CNN that I become demon possessed and have a black tongue.
[2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:46.320]  I've never heard of a black tongues till they said that.
[2:12:46.320 --> 2:12:48.320]  No, I mean, they're going to make up lies.
[2:12:48.320 --> 2:12:52.320]  And I have to give Trump so much credit because what he did with the Supreme Court justice
[2:12:52.320 --> 2:12:56.320]  and what he did by, you know, turning it into a conservative court and getting rid of Roe
[2:12:56.320 --> 2:12:59.320]  versus way to save so many countless lives.
[2:12:59.320 --> 2:13:03.320]  So Donald Trump is an American hero for all the countless numbers of babies that are going
[2:13:03.320 --> 2:13:05.320]  to be born that were once going to be terminated.
[2:13:05.320 --> 2:13:08.320]  And so, you know, he's a hero in my mind.
[2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:11.320]  Now, obviously with every president, you can say, I should have done this, should have done
[2:13:11.320 --> 2:13:12.320]  that.
[2:13:12.320 --> 2:13:16.320]  And if he runs, like I said, he's a great human being just for the Roe versus way.
[2:13:16.320 --> 2:13:17.320]  I agree.
[2:13:17.320 --> 2:13:21.320]  But it's counterbalanced by their now the FDA saying six month olds and others with this
[2:13:21.320 --> 2:13:22.320]  deadly shot.
[2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:25.320]  So he needs to come out and say, Hey, I got stampeded into this.
[2:13:25.320 --> 2:13:26.320]  It has some problems.
[2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:30.320]  They lied to me instead of coupling himself to this loser.
[2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:34.320]  Well, I mean, Alex, we live in a world where they said they look us in the face and they
[2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:38.320]  say sudden adult death syndrome is a real thing.
[2:13:38.320 --> 2:13:42.320]  That is the biggest crock of lies I've ever heard in my entire life.
[2:13:42.320 --> 2:13:43.320]  Now we've heard of SIDS.
[2:13:43.320 --> 2:13:47.320]  And if you look at the MMR scheduling on that, there's a direct correlation that the big
[2:13:47.320 --> 2:13:52.320]  pharma exactly says major Australian studies that SIDS and Japanese studies is caught by
[2:13:52.320 --> 2:13:53.320]  vaccines.
[2:13:53.320 --> 2:13:58.320]  Yes, they say correlation doesn't mean causation, but anybody with half a brain realizes that's
[2:13:58.320 --> 2:13:59.320]  a lie.
[2:13:59.320 --> 2:14:00.320]  That's a bold face.
[2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:04.320]  So they're looking us in our face and saying adults are just dying at 32 thin adults that
[2:14:04.320 --> 2:14:06.320]  don't that wouldn't normally have any sort of heart issue.
[2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:07.320]  No, no, I agree.
[2:14:07.320 --> 2:14:08.320]  But here's the deal.
[2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:09.320]  Here's why we know he's running.
[2:14:09.320 --> 2:14:14.320]  They just announced today six more women say he raped him with no evidence, just like
[2:14:14.320 --> 2:14:15.320]  Kavanaugh.
[2:14:15.320 --> 2:14:17.320]  I mean, is that not a big indicator?
[2:14:17.320 --> 2:14:18.320]  They're scared.
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:21.320]  Yeah, I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[2:14:21.320 --> 2:14:22.320]  All the lies.
[2:14:22.320 --> 2:14:25.320]  That's the problem is people are able to decide from the lies like you and me because we can
[2:14:25.320 --> 2:14:27.320]  say that the news is totally fake.
[2:14:27.320 --> 2:14:33.320]  But sadly, Alex, you know this, the mass population are all dumbed down on anti-depressants have
[2:14:33.320 --> 2:14:35.320]  no idea left, right, up and down.
[2:14:35.320 --> 2:14:37.320]  They're worried about their bills or worried about the inflation.
[2:14:37.320 --> 2:14:40.320]  And they have a president Joe Biden that's not doing anything to help them.
[2:14:40.320 --> 2:14:45.320]  And we have his son, Hunter Biden, giving $10,000 to Ukrainian and Russian prostitutes.
[2:14:45.320 --> 2:14:47.320]  And we don't hear a peep about it.
[2:14:47.320 --> 2:14:51.320]  So if people just looked one centimeter under the surface, I mean, just right underneath
[2:14:51.320 --> 2:14:55.320]  it, they would realize that we're living in a world of corruption and hypocrisy, but
[2:14:55.320 --> 2:14:58.320]  they can't see that the forest is right in front of their face because the big media
[2:14:58.320 --> 2:14:59.320]  tree that they have.
[2:14:59.320 --> 2:15:00.320]  Well, that's right.
[2:15:00.320 --> 2:15:02.320]  It's not just that he was with hookers.
[2:15:02.320 --> 2:15:06.320]  The media covered it up and obviously a lot of those are going to be Russian operatives.
[2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:10.320]  If you're the vice president's son with hookers, Russian hookers, you can bet you're being
[2:15:10.320 --> 2:15:11.320]  compromised.
[2:15:11.320 --> 2:15:12.320]  That's the big issue.
[2:15:12.320 --> 2:15:16.320]  And you know, Alex, honest to God, Hunter Biden is the most redeeming thing about Joe
[2:15:16.320 --> 2:15:17.320]  Biden.
[2:15:17.320 --> 2:15:18.320]  I actually am empathetic to Hunter Biden.
[2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:19.320]  He lost his mother.
[2:15:19.320 --> 2:15:21.320]  I have a lot of friends that have struggled with drugs and alcohol.
[2:15:21.320 --> 2:15:23.320]  So that's not even the worst part about it.
[2:15:23.320 --> 2:15:27.320]  The worst part is how he sold out our country to all these foreign companies, whether they're
[2:15:27.320 --> 2:15:28.320]  China.
[2:15:28.320 --> 2:15:30.320]  That's the worst part about Hunter Biden.
[2:15:30.320 --> 2:15:32.320]  But you know, his drug problem, that's the thing the media will give us.
[2:15:32.320 --> 2:15:35.320]  They'll give us crack pipes all day long, but they're not going to talk about his evil
[2:15:35.320 --> 2:15:38.320]  business dealings that has sold out the Americans.
[2:15:38.320 --> 2:15:39.320]  That's right.
[2:15:39.320 --> 2:15:44.320]  I'm saying the top communist Chinese spy that's on the laptop and it's all real.
[2:15:44.320 --> 2:15:45.320]  They said it wasn't real.
[2:15:45.320 --> 2:15:48.320]  They censored people that covered it, but we are vindicated again.
[2:15:48.320 --> 2:15:54.320]  Alex Stein is our guest, your phone call straight ahead, big, big Wednesday broadcast.

[2:16:44.320 --> 2:16:45.320]  They predict the great reset.
[2:16:45.320 --> 2:16:47.320]  And of course, part one, part two, and now the new part three of COVID land.
[2:16:47.320 --> 2:16:53.240]  But everyone needs to have 2,000 mules in their library so the globalists can't censor

[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:11.800]  But if you took it with Bish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[2:18:11.800 --> 2:18:15.000]  The fish oil is better than it and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:20.720]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[2:18:20.720 --> 2:18:24.480]  Crill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and I'm just sorry, you want

[2:18:26.200 --> 2:18:30.560]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, it might be, I'm not a medical statement here
[2:18:30.560 --> 2:18:34.320]  but let me tell you something, I eat five camperels of krill oil before I go to bed,
[2:18:34.320 --> 2:18:37.800]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[2:18:37.800 --> 2:18:45.280]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:48.720]  So we don't make a big profit off of it but you notice I just obsess because whatever
[2:18:48.720 --> 2:18:52.480]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it.

[2:19:58.640 --> 2:20:18.120]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:18.120 --> 2:20:27.800]  He came out to have his own event and Antifa showed up to protest and he was so happy they
[2:20:27.800 --> 2:20:57.640]  were so upset that he didn't know what to do or some of what happened.
[2:20:57.640 --> 2:20:58.640]  You see this?
[2:20:58.640 --> 2:20:59.640]  Let's go, baby.
[2:20:59.640 --> 2:21:00.640]  Look at this, my very own protesters.
[2:21:00.640 --> 2:21:01.640]  Friday, 99, I made it on the drive.
[2:21:01.640 --> 2:21:02.640]  See, they think we're crazy.
[2:21:02.640 --> 2:21:03.640]  We're 10 times crazier than they think.
[2:21:03.640 --> 2:21:04.640]  Hey, guys, they're coming to the show.
[2:21:04.640 --> 2:21:05.640]  Thank y'all so much.
[2:21:05.640 --> 2:21:06.640]  Are they?
[2:21:06.640 --> 2:21:07.640]  They're crazy?
[2:21:07.640 --> 2:21:08.640]  Of course.
[2:21:08.640 --> 2:21:09.640]  Wait till the people just leave me alone.
[2:21:09.640 --> 2:21:10.640]  Get off the bench.
[2:21:10.640 --> 2:21:11.640]  But he's starting to have it.
[2:21:11.640 --> 2:21:12.640]  This is how we drive and drive.
[2:21:12.640 --> 2:21:13.640]  This is how we win the talk.
[2:21:13.640 --> 2:21:14.640]  And you know, Alex Jones is a sad story, but you share it with us.
[2:21:14.640 --> 2:21:15.640]  You share it anywhere else, but...
[2:21:15.640 --> 2:21:16.640]  This is how we drive and drive.
[2:21:16.640 --> 2:21:17.640]  This is how we win the talk.
[2:21:17.640 --> 2:21:18.640]  And you know, Alex Jones is a sad story, but you share it with us.
[2:21:18.640 --> 2:21:31.640]  You share it anywhere else, but one city council meeting in Dallas is that them killing your
[2:21:31.640 --> 2:21:35.280]  mother in the hospital, denying her treatments, would push you over the edge.
[2:21:35.280 --> 2:21:37.920]  And now you're reaching millions of people a day.
[2:21:37.920 --> 2:21:40.640]  Your mother, I know, looking down from heaven, is very proud of you.
[2:21:40.640 --> 2:21:42.440]  Yeah, well, I appreciate that.
[2:21:42.440 --> 2:21:46.040]  And I just was a good friend of mine, Gavin McInnes, and I was on his show, and he actually
[2:21:46.040 --> 2:21:47.040]  said it.
[2:21:47.040 --> 2:21:49.720]  And he said, you're mom dying was the best thing that ever happened to you.
[2:21:49.720 --> 2:21:50.720]  Well, first of all, it's the worst thing.
[2:21:50.720 --> 2:21:55.320]  I would trade all the, you know, the hits and the clicks and followers and all the
[2:21:55.320 --> 2:21:58.280]  stuff I got from my mom in a second, have her back.
[2:21:58.280 --> 2:21:59.280]  But I will say this.
[2:21:59.280 --> 2:22:03.400]  It has made me a dangerous man because I have nothing to lose, and that is the most dangerous
[2:22:03.400 --> 2:22:04.400]  person as a person.
[2:22:04.400 --> 2:22:05.880]  And push you over the edge.
[2:22:05.880 --> 2:22:09.960]  100% Alex, and I have no choice but to fight back in this culture war.
[2:22:09.960 --> 2:22:13.880]  And the reason why I want to bring up what's happening with this arts and crafts antifas,
[2:22:13.880 --> 2:22:17.600]  these people are organized in a manner where half the people that are protesting, there's
[2:22:17.600 --> 2:22:19.400]  about 15 to 20 people there.
[2:22:19.400 --> 2:22:23.640]  I had, I was doing a charity event for a children's health defense, which is a charity Robert
[2:22:23.640 --> 2:22:24.880]  Kennedy runs.
[2:22:24.880 --> 2:22:28.160]  And it's, you know, it's an anti-vax charity, basically.
[2:22:28.160 --> 2:22:31.480]  And so they weren't there to, to protest that they were there to protest me.
[2:22:31.480 --> 2:22:34.960]  They had been sending the clubs, they've been flooding them with emails saying that, you
[2:22:34.960 --> 2:22:38.240]  know, I'm transphobic, I'm homophobic, not to allow me to go there.
[2:22:38.240 --> 2:22:39.240]  And then they showed up.
[2:22:39.240 --> 2:22:43.240]  So I guess my point that I want to bring up, it seems so artificial, Alex, it seems like
[2:22:43.240 --> 2:22:45.040]  they're getting paid by somebody.
[2:22:45.040 --> 2:22:48.160]  It seems like there's some sort of organization behind it because yeah, a couple of those
[2:22:48.160 --> 2:22:51.760]  people who didn't like me, I'm sure, but probably half of those protesters didn't know who
[2:22:51.760 --> 2:22:52.760]  I was.
[2:22:52.760 --> 2:22:53.760]  So it's just very confusing.
[2:22:53.760 --> 2:22:59.760]  Oh, it's on record that Soros and the Fortune 500 openly financed Black Lives Matter and
[2:22:59.760 --> 2:23:02.120]  Drag Queen Pettifall time.
[2:23:02.120 --> 2:23:03.120]  That's what I'm saying, Alex.
[2:23:03.120 --> 2:23:06.120]  I mean, if somebody paid them to be there, I mean, I just really don't think they hated
[2:23:06.120 --> 2:23:09.320]  me that much because, you know, they didn't really have anything to say.
[2:23:09.320 --> 2:23:12.520]  They just sat there with their sides because this is the thing is when you get in their
[2:23:12.520 --> 2:23:14.480]  face, I love confrontation.
[2:23:14.480 --> 2:23:19.120]  That's my whole, I hate to use this word brand, but I'm about to go to D.C. on the 13th.
[2:23:19.120 --> 2:23:20.120]  I'm going to stay there.
[2:23:20.120 --> 2:23:23.120]  I'm going on Tim Pool Show and I'm going to be at Capitol Hill and I'm going to go confront
[2:23:23.120 --> 2:23:24.120]  all these politicians.
[2:23:24.120 --> 2:23:25.120]  I'm going to say Elon Omar.
[2:23:25.120 --> 2:23:26.120]  You married your brother.
[2:23:26.120 --> 2:23:28.360]  I'm going to say AOC or my favorite big booty, Latina.
[2:23:28.360 --> 2:23:31.560]  I'm going to get in all these politicians face because that's what I like to do is I
[2:23:31.560 --> 2:23:32.560]  like confrontation.
[2:23:32.560 --> 2:23:36.840]  Now these people, they do when they thought they would scare you there, they're protesting
[2:23:36.840 --> 2:23:38.360]  and you loved it so much.
[2:23:38.360 --> 2:23:40.800]  What happened after you shot this video?
[2:23:40.800 --> 2:23:44.480]  Well, the funniest thing is that the adrenaline is so high and so I actually stopped drinking
[2:23:44.480 --> 2:23:47.840]  and using drugs and I saw, I used to smoke a little bit of marijuana, but I stopped
[2:23:47.840 --> 2:23:49.920]  after my mom died because it was making me so depressed.
[2:23:49.920 --> 2:23:54.120]  So my new drug is actually the adrenaline rush from calling these freaks out.
[2:23:54.120 --> 2:23:56.600]  But I'll tell you this much, the comedy club, they said, Hey, do you want to go out the
[2:23:56.600 --> 2:23:57.600]  back door?
[2:23:57.600 --> 2:23:58.600]  I'll speak, you know, there's a door.
[2:23:58.600 --> 2:23:59.600]  You can go out the back door.
[2:23:59.600 --> 2:24:00.600]  I said, are you kidding?
[2:24:00.600 --> 2:24:05.000]  I'm going on the front door and I'm holding court out there like I'm the Supreme Court
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  justice myself.
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:08.800]  Like I'm Clarence Thomas because they want us to live in fear.
[2:24:08.800 --> 2:24:09.800]  That's how they use.
[2:24:09.800 --> 2:24:10.800]  That's how they manipulate us.
[2:24:10.800 --> 2:24:14.960]  They keep us in that constant trauma-based mind control fight or flight state where we're
[2:24:14.960 --> 2:24:19.400]  like a dog with a little treat and that's how the globalist, oh, come here, do this,
[2:24:19.400 --> 2:24:20.720]  send adult death syndrome.
[2:24:20.720 --> 2:24:25.320]  So for me, I'm not going to fall in line with what they want and you let their fear-based
[2:24:25.320 --> 2:24:26.320]  tactics work.
[2:24:26.320 --> 2:24:28.920]  I'm going to live fearless and I know one day I'm going to die.
[2:24:28.920 --> 2:24:34.080]  That's a sad realization that I do not necessarily like, but I know that that's going to happen.
[2:24:34.080 --> 2:24:36.360]  I'm not going to live my life in fear of dying.
[2:24:36.360 --> 2:24:37.360]  So I'm going to go out there.
[2:24:37.360 --> 2:24:40.800]  I'm going to push the envelope and I'm going to call these people out and that's really
[2:24:40.800 --> 2:24:45.560]  just what gives you my most passion and most joy, Alice, in this day and age is exposing
[2:24:45.560 --> 2:24:48.960]  the hypocrisy that we're currently living under.
[2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:52.440]  And I like how you're nice to these people unless they got kids there.
[2:24:52.440 --> 2:24:56.280]  When they're out running around dressed like idiots, having, you know, crazy time, okay,
[2:24:56.280 --> 2:24:58.680]  we don't agree with your politics, but we don't hate you.
[2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:01.360]  When they bring kids to this stuff, then they're the enemy.
[2:25:01.360 --> 2:25:04.000]  100% Alice, I mean, that makes me sick.
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  There's no way a kid should be exposed to this stuff.
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:09.680]  And that's why the drag queen story time, that's kind of this month I've gone really
[2:25:09.680 --> 2:25:13.480]  viral because that was the, I think that happened in June 6th and that was one of the biggest
[2:25:13.480 --> 2:25:14.480]  stories for the week.
[2:25:14.480 --> 2:25:15.480]  It's not going to look itself.
[2:25:15.480 --> 2:25:20.120]  They got, they got kids in a sex bar and they had multiple legislation in Florida and Texas
[2:25:20.120 --> 2:25:25.240]  trying, you know, trying to outlaw this exact thing of being sexualized by drag queens in
[2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:26.240]  front of kids.
[2:25:26.240 --> 2:25:29.560]  But this, this brought attention to a major problem is that now all these governments
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:33.560]  like New York spending a $2 million for these drag queen story times.
[2:25:33.560 --> 2:25:37.760]  You asked his governments are backing it.
[2:25:37.760 --> 2:25:41.520]  So, so we're, so we're doing a good job of exposing this, but these children, they cannot
[2:25:41.520 --> 2:25:42.520]  make this choice.
[2:25:42.520 --> 2:25:46.160]  How, you know, having a trans child is like having a vegan cat.
[2:25:46.160 --> 2:25:48.360]  It's the owner making that decision.
[2:25:48.360 --> 2:25:52.920]  And that's the problem is we have bad saying, having a trans child is like having a vegan
[2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:53.920]  cat.
[2:25:53.920 --> 2:25:54.920]  Man, that's genius.
[2:25:54.920 --> 2:25:59.120]  And it's seriously, it's just these parents, and that's why Bill Maher forget his politics,
[2:25:59.120 --> 2:26:02.440]  but you know, he said it best, you look at the amount of kids that are gender hormone
[2:26:02.440 --> 2:26:07.680]  surgery or gender, you know, hormone blockers in California compared to Ohio is alarmingly
[2:26:07.680 --> 2:26:11.880]  much higher because those are the people, the parents that are making these.
[2:26:11.880 --> 2:26:16.040]  If they can't abort the baby before it's born, they want to abort their genitals later.
[2:26:16.040 --> 2:26:22.040]  This is human neutering is the transgender movement was set up to sterilize boys.
[2:26:22.040 --> 2:26:23.040]  That's 100% right.
[2:26:23.040 --> 2:26:24.960]  And this thing has been happening for a long time.
[2:26:24.960 --> 2:26:28.800]  You know, this, that, you know, this kind of trans movement now she's coming into effect
[2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:32.320]  where now they have legislation, now they have backing, but we live in a clown world
[2:26:32.320 --> 2:26:35.480]  where everybody knows it's not okay to do this in front of kids.
[2:26:35.480 --> 2:26:38.840]  Even when you call the drag queens out on it, they feel shame and some people.
[2:26:38.840 --> 2:26:42.000]  And by the way, watch these videos, almost all the children recoil.
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:47.240]  Oh, Alex, they were trying to play on their video game, their handheld video games, Nintendo's
[2:26:47.240 --> 2:26:50.240]  and the parents were taking the Nintendo's out of their hands and saying, look at the
[2:26:50.240 --> 2:26:51.240]  drag queen.
[2:26:51.240 --> 2:26:53.800]  So that's, that's all parents problems.
[2:26:53.800 --> 2:26:54.800]  And this is the problem.
[2:26:54.800 --> 2:26:55.800]  It's a sexual implantation.
[2:26:55.800 --> 2:26:59.720]  Now, me, I've looked at porn, I've been desensitized to it, but the first time you see a pair
[2:26:59.720 --> 2:27:02.240]  of boobs, I can still remember it like it was yesterday.
[2:27:02.240 --> 2:27:07.200]  The first time you lose your virginity, these are, they are imprinting them for what they're
[2:27:07.200 --> 2:27:08.200]  doing.
[2:27:08.200 --> 2:27:09.200]  Exactly.
[2:27:09.200 --> 2:27:10.200]  Yeah.
[2:27:10.200 --> 2:27:11.200]  You're much more sensitive to it.
[2:27:11.200 --> 2:27:15.920]  I was imprinted on stealing my dad's playboys when I was like, no, I was like, oh my God,
[2:27:15.920 --> 2:27:16.920]  I want this.
[2:27:16.920 --> 2:27:20.520]  I was having to sneak around the bedroom, like find them in the closet.
[2:27:20.520 --> 2:27:22.680]  There was just a girl with her top off.
[2:27:22.680 --> 2:27:26.600]  Imagine their little kids being taken to this and being taught that some crazy dude in the
[2:27:26.600 --> 2:27:28.880]  clown outfit is who they are.
[2:27:28.880 --> 2:27:30.160]  And people love you all over the world.
[2:27:30.160 --> 2:27:31.160]  That's something I should add.
[2:27:31.160 --> 2:27:35.880]  They love you in India and Russia and China and in Africa.
[2:27:35.880 --> 2:27:36.880]  People love you, brother.
[2:27:36.880 --> 2:27:40.040]  Well, they really don't like me in Germany because that's where my tweets get reported.
[2:27:40.040 --> 2:27:43.120]  But I just have to say the thing is I still remember the Playboy magazine, I had a Jenny
[2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:47.120]  McCarthy Playboy magazine that we had to share that my buddies would have on the weekend
[2:27:47.120 --> 2:27:48.120]  and I would have it.
[2:27:48.120 --> 2:27:51.480]  But now with the sexualization of kids, you give them an iPad, they type in, you know,
[2:27:51.480 --> 2:27:54.160]  they can find porn, just opiate, you know, copious amounts.
[2:27:54.160 --> 2:27:55.160]  Well, that's it.
[2:27:55.160 --> 2:27:59.200]  I mean, when you're 10 years old, you're like, all right, we all stole these from our dad.
[2:27:59.200 --> 2:28:03.440]  Let's go meet down under the bridge and look at them and like, oh, my God, look at her.
[2:28:03.440 --> 2:28:04.440]  Look at her.
[2:28:04.440 --> 2:28:07.000]  And that's, that's, you know, that's not adults doing it.
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  It's not a pet filly.
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:09.160]  It's kids stealing Playboys.
[2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:11.160]  It's just women admiring them.
[2:28:11.160 --> 2:28:16.760]  Imagine how healthy that is stealing the Playboys and trading them versus pedophiles coming
[2:28:16.760 --> 2:28:17.760]  and kids still in their laps.
[2:28:17.760 --> 2:28:20.360]  I mean, it's just light years down a rattle.
[2:28:20.360 --> 2:28:25.760]  I mean, Alex, we didn't have our teacher's Facebook profile, Instagram profile, so now
[2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:28.000]  you know your day teachers, gay crews.
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:30.120]  So you just know your whole backstory of these teachers.
[2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:33.360]  And I know we're about to go on a break, but you just got to make a heterosexual coach
[2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:34.360]  doesn't go.
[2:28:34.360 --> 2:28:35.360]  Yeah.
[2:28:35.360 --> 2:28:36.360]  I had sex with my wife today.
[2:28:36.360 --> 2:28:37.360]  Let me tell you how I have sex.
[2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:38.960]  It's all pedophilia.
[2:28:38.960 --> 2:28:40.440]  It's all wrong.

[2:32:58.720 --> 2:33:24.560]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:24.560 --> 2:33:38.800]  Live from Austin Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:38.800 --> 2:33:44.400]  The Heights Public Library today debuting a new children's story hour called drag queen
[2:33:44.400 --> 2:33:45.640]  story time.
[2:33:45.640 --> 2:33:50.200]  My name is Blackberry, I'm a bearded drag queen, that means I'm a lady with lots of
[2:33:50.200 --> 2:33:51.200]  facial hair.
[2:33:51.200 --> 2:33:55.200]  I'm actually going to be one of the drag queens reading for drag queen story time, drag queen
[2:33:55.200 --> 2:33:56.200]  story time.
[2:33:56.200 --> 2:34:00.080]  And we have to warn you ladies and gentlemen, if you've got young or impressionable children
[2:34:00.080 --> 2:34:04.920]  in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[2:34:04.920 --> 2:34:10.160]  And we witnessed parents taking their children as young as two inside to take part.
[2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:12.520]  Talking, singing and reading.
[2:34:12.520 --> 2:34:17.880]  We can both be grooms to an audience of preschoolers, toddlers and their caregivers.
[2:34:17.880 --> 2:34:25.040]  The hips on the drag queen go swish, swish, swish, turn around and shake your butt, shake
[2:34:25.040 --> 2:34:26.240]  them, shake them, shake them, shake them, shake them.
[2:34:26.240 --> 2:34:29.400]  It was a first for this branch of the public library too.
[2:34:29.400 --> 2:34:30.400]  Are you nervous?
[2:34:30.400 --> 2:34:31.400]  Yes.
[2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:32.400]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[2:34:32.400 --> 2:34:33.400]  No.
[2:34:33.400 --> 2:34:34.400]  No.
[2:34:34.400 --> 2:34:37.160]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going
[2:34:37.160 --> 2:34:39.760]  to be the grooming of the next generation.
[2:34:39.760 --> 2:34:43.840]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more
[2:34:43.840 --> 2:34:45.160]  comfortable than seeing it.
[2:34:45.160 --> 2:34:53.040]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone, no one's there to persuade people or to recruit
[2:34:53.040 --> 2:34:54.040]  people.
[2:34:54.040 --> 2:34:56.120]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up?
[2:34:56.120 --> 2:34:57.800]  You could be a drag queen superhero.
[2:34:57.800 --> 2:34:58.800]  Pretty nervous.
[2:34:58.800 --> 2:34:59.800]  Yes.
[2:34:59.800 --> 2:35:07.360]  They were all accepting, they all were happy about it and excited and giving me hugs and
[2:35:07.360 --> 2:35:08.360]  everything.
[2:35:08.360 --> 2:35:11.560]  The woman gets up on her table, spreads her legs, it's a man.
[2:35:11.560 --> 2:35:13.560]  This is adult entertainment.
[2:35:13.560 --> 2:35:16.080]  Most people seem to walk away having a good time.
[2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:17.080]  I start them young, right?
[2:35:17.080 --> 2:35:18.080]  I start them young, right?
[2:35:18.080 --> 2:35:19.080]  Anyone can do drag.
[2:35:19.080 --> 2:35:20.080]  Everyone can do drag.
[2:35:20.080 --> 2:35:21.080]  Everyone.
[2:35:21.080 --> 2:35:22.080]  Teach the children.
[2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:23.080]  Teach the children.
[2:35:23.080 --> 2:35:24.080]  I'm all about education.
[2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:25.080]  I actually do story time with drag queens in Chicago.
[2:35:25.080 --> 2:35:26.080]  Right?
[2:35:26.080 --> 2:35:27.080]  Yes.
[2:35:27.080 --> 2:35:28.080]  Family programming.
[2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:29.080]  Love it.
[2:35:29.080 --> 2:35:30.080]  Yes.
[2:35:30.080 --> 2:35:42.600]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children
[2:35:42.600 --> 2:35:47.120]  at a Houston public library as part of its drag queen story hour.
[2:35:47.120 --> 2:35:52.600]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina,
[2:35:52.600 --> 2:35:55.920]  is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[2:35:55.920 --> 2:35:59.520]  In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an eight-year-old boy.
[2:35:59.520 --> 2:36:02.600]  This is Tatiana Malanina, my sister from Queens of the Week.
[2:36:02.600 --> 2:36:04.000]  What has this world come to?
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:06.800]  It's come to a world where drag kids actually exist.
[2:36:06.800 --> 2:36:08.800]  And people do catamina on a couch.
[2:36:08.800 --> 2:36:14.800]  Desmond is the world's youngest club kid, and we challenge you as the people out there
[2:36:14.800 --> 2:36:15.800]  to find a younger club kid.
[2:36:15.800 --> 2:36:16.800]  Will they find one?
[2:36:16.800 --> 2:36:17.800]  No.
[2:36:17.800 --> 2:36:21.800]  Please welcome Desmond Naples, a.k.a. Desmond is amazing.
[2:36:21.800 --> 2:36:25.800]  Have you been to a nightclub?
[2:36:25.800 --> 2:36:26.800]  No.
[2:36:26.800 --> 2:36:27.800]  No?
[2:36:27.800 --> 2:36:28.800]  Okay.
[2:36:28.800 --> 2:36:38.560]  So people all over Twitter, millions of views this week alone, have looked at
[2:36:38.560 --> 2:36:43.160]  clips of us five, six years ago, three years ago, and saying, Alex Jones is psychic.
[2:36:43.160 --> 2:36:44.160]  He's Nostradamus.
[2:36:44.160 --> 2:36:46.160]  How do you know all this?
[2:36:46.160 --> 2:36:52.000]  Apple, Google, state governments, the federal government, the German government, the French
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:54.760]  government, the U.K. government, they've all been funding this.
[2:36:54.760 --> 2:37:00.160]  So we knew this was their main assault to normalize pedophilia with children.
[2:37:00.160 --> 2:37:03.600]  And they took over the Catholic Church with pedophiles, they took over the Boy Scouts,
[2:37:03.600 --> 2:37:05.560]  Penn State, the list goes on and on.
[2:37:05.560 --> 2:37:10.440]  This is a cult that they get you to accept, you bring them in, they abuse children, and
[2:37:10.440 --> 2:37:13.160]  now they try to blackmail you with it.
[2:37:13.160 --> 2:37:14.480]  Alex Stein, that's my view on this.
[2:37:14.480 --> 2:37:17.040]  I want to go to some phone calls with you, but I'm going to ask one of the questions
[2:37:17.040 --> 2:37:18.040]  here.
[2:37:18.040 --> 2:37:22.480]  What is front and center for you on your radar screen, on your heart right now you want to
[2:37:22.480 --> 2:37:23.480]  talk about?
[2:37:23.480 --> 2:37:27.080]  Well, first thing I want to say, you know, the four words the globalist and most scared
[2:37:27.080 --> 2:37:31.560]  of is Alex Jones was right, and that's a trending hashtag always on Twitter.
[2:37:31.560 --> 2:37:34.080]  So, you know, you're able to foresee all of this.
[2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:37.600]  And I don't want to just kiss your butt, but really anybody with half a brain not saying
[2:37:37.600 --> 2:37:42.040]  that you're not one of the most talented broadcasters ever, but all this is done in plain sight.
[2:37:42.040 --> 2:37:44.960]  You know, if you're really paying attention, you can actually see the grooming, you can
[2:37:44.960 --> 2:37:45.960]  see their agenda.
[2:37:45.960 --> 2:37:49.560]  The fact that Nancy Pelosi, you know, is so pro-abortion and she's getting communion
[2:37:49.560 --> 2:37:52.040]  from the Pope with her husband who has a DUI.
[2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:55.400]  So it's all in front of her face that they just want to actual murder kids and the kids
[2:37:55.400 --> 2:37:58.920]  that are born, they want to, you know, obviously, you know, transition them to the opposite
[2:37:58.920 --> 2:37:59.920]  sex.
[2:37:59.920 --> 2:38:04.640]  And for me, what's in my radar right now with that's coming up is I had a really effective
[2:38:04.640 --> 2:38:08.680]  video of me calling out Dan Crenshaw for being a globalist and as well as Ted Cruz,
[2:38:08.680 --> 2:38:12.760]  you know, for their support of the Ukraine, you know, spending their $80 billion and giving
[2:38:12.760 --> 2:38:14.960]  that to Ukraine instead of fixing our border.
[2:38:14.960 --> 2:38:18.960]  There was just 40 immigrants, excuse me, 42 immigrants that died in a hot trailer outside
[2:38:18.960 --> 2:38:19.960]  of San Antonio, Texas.
[2:38:19.960 --> 2:38:23.000]  It's actually 52 now, 52 now.
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:26.360]  52 now, I think some of them were alive when they found them.
[2:38:26.360 --> 2:38:31.200]  So 50 people are dying and all these people are giving $80 billion and worrying about
[2:38:31.200 --> 2:38:33.400]  the border between the Ukraine and Russia.
[2:38:33.400 --> 2:38:34.400]  Yeah.
[2:38:34.400 --> 2:38:38.360]  We have a massive problem with our border that has more holes than Swiss cheese and
[2:38:38.360 --> 2:38:40.920]  they are actually killing people by them neglecting it.
[2:38:40.920 --> 2:38:45.040]  So for me, if I'm going to go to Washington, DC, and I'm going to call out all of these
[2:38:45.040 --> 2:38:49.760]  on the right and left, if you voted to give money to the Ukraine, I'm sorry, I got to
[2:38:49.760 --> 2:38:51.600]  call you out because we have serious issues.
[2:38:51.600 --> 2:38:52.600]  I've lost friends.
[2:38:52.600 --> 2:38:56.680]  I lost the deal, Crenshaw contacted a very well-known podcaster and wanted to talk to
[2:38:56.680 --> 2:38:59.120]  me and I said, finally I'll meet with you, but then he had chickened out.
[2:38:59.120 --> 2:39:01.480]  He's like, why is Alex lying about me?
[2:39:01.480 --> 2:39:05.520]  He got up a month ago and said, I actually have the most conservative voting record.
[2:39:05.520 --> 2:39:06.520]  Don't listen to MTG.
[2:39:06.520 --> 2:39:07.520]  She's a fake.
[2:39:07.520 --> 2:39:08.520]  I've checked the voting records.
[2:39:08.520 --> 2:39:09.520]  He's a liar.
[2:39:09.520 --> 2:39:13.280]  So Dan, your problem is, okay, you got an iPad, you're a veteran, great.
[2:39:13.280 --> 2:39:16.840]  We love veterans, but we don't love veterans like Benedict Arnold.
[2:39:16.840 --> 2:39:17.840]  100%.
[2:39:17.840 --> 2:39:22.280]  And listen, I support the guys in uniform, but I don't necessarily support the uniform
[2:39:22.280 --> 2:39:23.600]  being the world police.
[2:39:23.600 --> 2:39:24.680]  I don't support it.
[2:39:24.680 --> 2:39:25.680]  I'm not a neocon.
[2:39:25.680 --> 2:39:29.960]  I don't want us to go and kill people for the military industrial complex so people
[2:39:29.960 --> 2:39:34.520]  can literally get rich on their stock trading and buying these weapons.
[2:39:34.520 --> 2:39:38.120]  I care about the American people that are in that uniform, that are going to fight wars
[2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:41.200]  that they don't get to choose all because they want to get a college education or because
[2:39:41.200 --> 2:39:42.560]  they want to better their lives.
[2:39:42.560 --> 2:39:48.080]  So I don't like these politicians that actually manipulate our population into fighting wars
[2:39:48.080 --> 2:39:50.240]  that don't benefit the American people.
[2:39:50.240 --> 2:39:54.240]  I totally agree with you, we'll play that Crenshaw clip, start of the next segment.
[2:39:54.240 --> 2:39:57.680]  Let's take some phone calls on Trump running for president.
[2:39:57.680 --> 2:39:59.600]  The word is he is going to announce Monday.
[2:39:59.600 --> 2:40:02.680]  He may have tactical flexibility, as Roger said.
[2:40:02.680 --> 2:40:08.040]  He may not do it, but right now, big exclusive, videos on infowars.com, exclusive, find it
[2:40:08.040 --> 2:40:09.920]  infowars.com and share it.
[2:40:09.920 --> 2:40:13.680]  Trump set to announce, Trump set to announce this Monday, July 4th.
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:14.680]  Who's been holding the longest?
[2:40:14.680 --> 2:40:15.680]  Is it Matt?
[2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:16.680]  Is it Brandon?
[2:40:16.680 --> 2:40:17.680]  Is it Joel?
[2:40:17.680 --> 2:40:18.680]  Is it Honey?
[2:40:18.680 --> 2:40:24.920]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Matt in New York, you're on the air with Alex
[2:40:24.920 --> 2:40:25.920]  Stein.
[2:40:25.920 --> 2:40:26.920]  Yeah, baby, let's go.
[2:40:26.920 --> 2:40:27.920]  On the ground.
[2:40:27.920 --> 2:40:32.520]  Yo, I can't get that out of my head.
[2:40:32.520 --> 2:40:35.480]  I'm real quick, you got to give the Democrats a sad, tired video.
[2:40:35.480 --> 2:40:40.640]  Black old tongue won't you come and let go of the tears.
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:42.120]  What do you think about that one?
[2:40:42.120 --> 2:40:43.120]  That would be hilarious.
[2:40:43.120 --> 2:40:47.400]  Alex Jones with a black tongue, just licking Democrat kids like, oh, it'd be great.
[2:40:47.400 --> 2:40:49.800]  Anyway, yeah, I think it's great Trump's getting back in.
[2:40:49.800 --> 2:40:51.680]  I mean, we got to cut him a little slack.
[2:40:51.680 --> 2:40:53.080]  He rolled out the debt shot.
[2:40:53.080 --> 2:40:57.680]  He gave us, uh, ventilators, which had a 90% kill rate when we had lung infections down
[2:40:57.680 --> 2:40:59.160]  to about a half a percent.
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:00.480]  I mean, give him a little slack.
[2:41:00.480 --> 2:41:04.240]  He threw on the low leader, I mean, just a couple of little things.
[2:41:04.240 --> 2:41:08.160]  We got to, we got to just throw that out of our brain and just get ready for the roller
[2:41:08.160 --> 2:41:12.440]  coaster ride because he's coming back and they're going to form the new America.
[2:41:12.440 --> 2:41:13.440]  That's right.
[2:41:13.440 --> 2:41:16.760]  They're going to herd all the patriots into Texas and Florida and then they're going to
[2:41:16.760 --> 2:41:22.000]  have all the Nazis that infiltrate South America form up with detection.
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  And that's it.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  They're going to wipe out.
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  You're on fire.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:26.240]  You're on fire.
[2:41:26.240 --> 2:41:30.360]  But if you could show me Trump fluently to express, I will not support him ever.
[2:41:30.360 --> 2:41:32.360]  I'm mad at him about the poison shot.
[2:41:32.360 --> 2:41:33.600]  That you said is true.
[2:41:33.600 --> 2:41:37.040]  The second thing you said, where's the proof Trump fluently to express?
[2:41:37.040 --> 2:41:38.560]  He's not on those phone logs.
[2:41:38.560 --> 2:41:39.560]  He's not on those flight logs.
[2:41:39.560 --> 2:41:40.560]  They said six times, right?
[2:41:40.560 --> 2:41:41.560]  And they say six times.
[2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:42.560]  Wasn't that confirmed?
[2:41:42.560 --> 2:41:43.560]  Excuse me?
[2:41:43.560 --> 2:41:48.720]  Wasn't that confirmed that he was at the island six times on, not on the Lolita Express,
[2:41:48.720 --> 2:41:50.400]  but he was on Epstein Island six times.
[2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:51.400]  Wasn't that, wasn't that confirmed?
[2:41:51.400 --> 2:41:53.200]  Alex Don, you see any proof of that?
[2:41:53.200 --> 2:41:57.280]  Well, supposedly there's some story that he wasn't on the actual Lolita Express that
[2:41:57.280 --> 2:42:01.840]  he was on a plane with Jeffrey Epstein one time supposedly, but listen, it doesn't matter.
[2:42:01.840 --> 2:42:02.840]  Nobody's going to be perfect.
[2:42:02.840 --> 2:42:06.520]  But this what does matter is you see, there's a viral video of Marina Abramovich talking
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:10.520]  about how, and she's a Satanist and we're back to go to break very soon, but she talked
[2:42:10.520 --> 2:42:14.320]  about how there are some shamans that were high on drugs and they were actually saying
[2:42:14.320 --> 2:42:17.960]  that they wanted Trump because Trump will bring the most chaos.
[2:42:17.960 --> 2:42:21.440]  So you know, Lord knows they probably want Trump to come back because they want to have
[2:42:21.440 --> 2:42:22.680]  another summer of love.
[2:42:22.680 --> 2:42:26.560]  So I'm going to say this, I studied this.
[2:42:26.560 --> 2:42:29.840]  Trump was never on the Lolita Express according to flight logs.
[2:42:29.840 --> 2:42:34.000]  The Democrats have confused it just like they say that Trump grabbed the wheel of the Secret
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:36.520]  Service limo and it's not true.
[2:42:36.520 --> 2:42:37.800]  Just like I have a black tongue.
[2:42:37.800 --> 2:42:38.800]  It's not true.
[2:42:38.800 --> 2:42:41.080]  I didn't talk to Trump on January 5th or 6th.
[2:42:41.080 --> 2:42:42.080]  Not true.
[2:42:42.080 --> 2:42:44.280]  Hadn't talked to Trump for over a year.
[2:42:44.280 --> 2:42:45.280]  Whenever that went down.
[2:42:45.280 --> 2:42:46.280]  All right.
[2:42:46.280 --> 2:42:47.280]  Thank you, Matt.
[2:42:47.280 --> 2:42:48.280]  I hear your points, though.
[2:42:48.280 --> 2:42:52.960]  Honey, Joel, Bob, Brandon, straight ahead with Prime, I'm Alex Stein.
[2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:53.960]  Stay with us.
[2:42:53.960 --> 2:43:02.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 30 months, we've witnessed the globalists hit humanity
[2:43:02.280 --> 2:43:04.960]  and hit humanity extremely hard.

[2:43:57.400 --> 2:44:02.240]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[2:44:02.240 --> 2:44:04.600]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[2:44:04.600 --> 2:44:09.120]  I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[2:44:09.120 --> 2:44:13.720]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1 and it worked pretty good.
[2:44:13.720 --> 2:44:16.960]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that stew, you know, with a deep breath
[2:44:16.960 --> 2:44:19.040]  and sourced, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[2:44:19.040 --> 2:44:20.040]  So I took it.
[2:44:20.040 --> 2:44:26.080]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[2:44:26.080 --> 2:44:30.880]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again and over the course of the
[2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:35.080]  next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your
[2:44:35.080 --> 2:44:36.080]  supplements.
[2:44:36.080 --> 2:44:37.800]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[2:44:37.800 --> 2:44:42.200]  The one I like recently is knock out literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[2:44:42.200 --> 2:44:43.200]  It's amazing.
[2:44:43.200 --> 2:44:44.200]  It works.
[2:44:44.200 --> 2:44:45.880]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[2:44:45.880 --> 2:44:48.520]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[2:44:48.520 --> 2:44:52.480]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[2:44:52.480 --> 2:44:56.200]  That's what we said, brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[2:44:56.200 --> 2:44:58.120]  Look at that.
[2:44:58.120 --> 2:45:00.520]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[2:45:00.520 --> 2:45:01.520]  That's because it's been denatured.
[2:45:01.520 --> 2:45:02.520]  It's been marked down.
[2:45:02.520 --> 2:45:05.520]  We didn't do that.
[2:45:05.520 --> 2:45:09.400]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something, but this is the very best I can
[2:45:09.400 --> 2:45:10.400]  get.
[2:45:10.400 --> 2:45:12.120]  I'd rather go to hell and do that.
[2:45:12.120 --> 2:45:17.960]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product because
[2:45:17.960 --> 2:45:21.400]  I want that good will.
[2:45:21.400 --> 2:45:24.480]  What I do to you, I do to myself, don't you get the big secret?
[2:45:24.480 --> 2:45:27.160]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[2:45:27.160 --> 2:45:29.320]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[2:45:29.320 --> 2:45:39.800]  And this little jewel right here is solid, liquid consciousness.
[2:45:39.800 --> 2:45:41.440]  Look it up.
[2:45:41.440 --> 2:45:47.240]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[2:45:47.240 --> 2:45:52.800]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil, just like
[2:45:52.800 --> 2:45:56.880]  our information is dynamite, so are our products in 4store.com.
[2:45:56.880 --> 2:45:58.640]  The globalists are making their move.
[2:45:58.640 --> 2:46:00.560]  Their great reset is here.
[2:46:00.560 --> 2:46:02.080]  They're coming for your children.
[2:46:02.080 --> 2:46:04.400]  They're coming for the value of your currency.
[2:46:04.400 --> 2:46:06.520]  They're coming for your national sovereignty.
[2:46:06.520 --> 2:46:11.200]  They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny.
[2:46:11.200 --> 2:46:13.520]  They're coming for your free speech.
[2:46:13.520 --> 2:46:15.440]  They're coming for your privacy.
[2:46:15.440 --> 2:46:20.320]  And ladies and gentlemen, they're coming for your right to vote and have your representative
[2:46:20.320 --> 2:46:23.760]  and government that you and your fellow Americans choose.
[2:46:23.760 --> 2:46:29.400]  The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary ever made in my view, 2000 Mules

[2:46:48.120 --> 2:46:52.280]  If they're planning to run the same scams again, this film can stop them if you take
[2:46:52.280 --> 2:46:57.960]  action infowarsstore.com, 2000 Mules.
[2:46:57.960 --> 2:47:25.280]  Feeding a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:27.960 --> 2:47:42.640]  I pass McCain, hey I pass McCain, look at I pass McCain right here, you're Rhino, you're
[2:47:42.640 --> 2:47:54.000]  globalist, you're globalist Rhino, hey you're globalist Rhino, I pass McCain, I pass McCain,
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:48:05.800]  I pass McCain, I pass McCain, you're globalist, I pass McCain, I pass McCain, I pass McCain,
[2:48:05.800 --> 2:48:07.920]  I pass McCain, you're globalist Rhino.
[2:48:07.920 --> 2:48:09.520]  Looking people attacking Alex Stein and bringing it to hotel.
[2:48:09.520 --> 2:48:14.020]  you know the more I think about it, takes a lot of gall for I pass McCain to attack moms
[2:48:14.020 --> 2:48:18.440]  worried about baby formula as quote pro Russia, I mean that's one of the most outrageous things
[2:48:18.440 --> 2:48:21.720]  I think I've ever heard.
[2:48:21.720 --> 2:48:27.000]  So there you go, that footage, radio listeners couldn't see it, but it's Ipatch McCain's
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:32.040]  people attacking Alex Stein for just asking him questions and punching him and shoving
[2:48:32.040 --> 2:48:36.200]  him against a wall like, how dare you, but let me answer the question the last caller
[2:48:36.200 --> 2:48:40.640]  is saying, Trump flew on Lita Express, which means he flew to the island.
[2:48:40.640 --> 2:48:44.520]  Nope, we have the flight logs, they've all been checked on that airplane.
[2:48:44.520 --> 2:48:53.520]  In 1997, they shared a flight from Newark into Palm Beach, and that's the only time
[2:48:53.520 --> 2:49:02.120]  they ever flew was 25 years ago, Donald Trump on his plane to Palm Beach when he was invited
[2:49:02.120 --> 2:49:03.400]  on it.
[2:49:03.400 --> 2:49:06.880]  And if I find Trump was on that island or any of this, he says he hasn't been, I'll
[2:49:06.880 --> 2:49:10.160]  be against Trump, but that's leftist rumors.
[2:49:10.160 --> 2:49:14.480]  Just like they say, Trump hates Mexicans, worth the video.
[2:49:14.480 --> 2:49:16.640]  Trump says all Mexicans are criminals, where's the video?
[2:49:16.640 --> 2:49:20.240]  Or Alex Jones, the white supremacist, or Alex Jones says he's a fake.
[2:49:20.240 --> 2:49:21.240]  Where's the video?
[2:49:21.240 --> 2:49:24.880]  Yeah, do they, at socialite events, where they photograph together probably 10 times?
[2:49:24.880 --> 2:49:25.880]  Absolutely.
[2:49:25.880 --> 2:49:27.960]  I go off what Trump does, Roe v. Wade, you name it.
[2:49:27.960 --> 2:49:31.640]  I'm not defending Trump, I'm pissed at Trump, but I just want to actually attack on real
[2:49:31.640 --> 2:49:32.640]  issues.
[2:49:32.640 --> 2:49:33.640]  Alex Stein?
[2:49:33.640 --> 2:49:35.440]  Well, thank you for having me.
[2:49:35.440 --> 2:49:41.880]  So in that video, I put Tucker Carlson at the end, he coined the phrase, I patch McCain
[2:49:41.880 --> 2:49:45.160]  because Dan Crenshaw was complaining about mothers that were complaining about not having
[2:49:45.160 --> 2:49:48.520]  formula to feed their baby and calling them puppets for Putin.
[2:49:48.520 --> 2:49:50.760]  And I want to say my biological father is Tucker Carlson.
[2:49:50.760 --> 2:49:52.000]  He's a huge fan of yours.
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:55.640]  And I have to give him a lot of credit because every, what happened after that video, Dan
[2:49:55.640 --> 2:50:01.480]  Crenshaw called all the left-wing media, yet Adam Kinzinger, Jake Tapper, media, running
[2:50:01.480 --> 2:50:05.320]  coverage for him saying that I assaulted him, saying that I'm a member of the Proud Boys.
[2:50:05.320 --> 2:50:09.920]  It was all lies, because there's other angles where I had about four people filming.
[2:50:09.920 --> 2:50:13.440]  It proves that they are the ones that assaulted me, and so I'm going to end up filing a lawsuit
[2:50:13.440 --> 2:50:14.440]  against him.
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:19.760]  I just kind of waited to see if he was going to try to pull some sort of legal scam himself.
[2:50:19.760 --> 2:50:23.520]  But I'm going to go after Dan Crenshaw because he's a liar, he's a rhino.
[2:50:23.520 --> 2:50:28.560]  All the people that came out in his favor, Alex, were all the left-wing line media.
[2:50:28.560 --> 2:50:29.560]  That says it all.
[2:50:29.560 --> 2:50:33.400]  The people that defend you the most and people on the right aren't defending him.
[2:50:33.400 --> 2:50:37.600]  As a matter of fact, this is at the, you know, this is at the GOP conference convention
[2:50:37.600 --> 2:50:44.360]  in Houston, Texas, and everybody there, universally, Alex, did not like Dan Crenshaw.
[2:50:44.360 --> 2:50:45.360]  So-
[2:50:45.360 --> 2:50:46.360]  Well, he has no instincts.
[2:50:46.360 --> 2:50:47.600]  He has no instincts.
[2:50:47.600 --> 2:50:53.680]  The fact that he thinks going on CNN while making popular Republicans, he's an idiot.
[2:50:53.680 --> 2:50:58.880]  And Alex, he was so, he has such thin skin, he at-tweeted me and called me a little boy.
[2:50:58.880 --> 2:51:02.160]  I'm about two feet taller than him and said, I can't get a girlfriend.
[2:51:02.160 --> 2:51:06.880]  All fake, I have too many girlfriends, I have too many issues with women, much less can't
[2:51:06.880 --> 2:51:07.880]  get one.
[2:51:07.880 --> 2:51:08.880]  And so it's just-
[2:51:08.880 --> 2:51:09.880]  I will vouch for that, Alex.
[2:51:09.880 --> 2:51:12.360]  I'm not gay, but you are a good-looking, tall guy.
[2:51:12.360 --> 2:51:16.280]  So the point is, is it, yeah, the idea that you can't get women as proposters.
[2:51:16.280 --> 2:51:20.400]  I mean, and that's, and it's just nanny-nanny boo-boo, like some sort of, you know, middle
[2:51:20.400 --> 2:51:21.720]  school insult.
[2:51:21.720 --> 2:51:25.440]  This guy is a politician, he's at that, you know, he's making major decisions.
[2:51:25.440 --> 2:51:28.120]  He needs to have some professionalism, but he doesn't have it.
[2:51:28.120 --> 2:51:32.160]  Just like when that 17-year-old girl called him to the carpet for, you know, for saying
[2:51:32.160 --> 2:51:35.520]  that Jesus is like Superman, and he totally melted down.
[2:51:35.520 --> 2:51:40.240]  So this guy, just because he's a war veteran, doesn't excuse all of his terrible policies
[2:51:40.240 --> 2:51:43.120]  and all, and just his lack of professionalism overall.
[2:51:43.120 --> 2:51:46.200]  So he's not a well-liked guy.
[2:51:46.200 --> 2:51:48.680]  And I hope somebody will primary him, I hope somebody will beat him.
[2:51:48.680 --> 2:51:51.880]  Let me say this, let me say this about Crenshaw.
[2:51:51.880 --> 2:51:55.120]  I don't usually get on bandwagons because everybody hates him, I've just tried to sit
[2:51:55.120 --> 2:51:56.120]  back.
[2:51:56.120 --> 2:51:57.120]  People really hate him.
[2:51:57.120 --> 2:51:59.240]  I mean, I'm at dinner with former liberals.
[2:51:59.240 --> 2:52:00.240]  They hate that Crenshaw.
[2:52:00.240 --> 2:52:03.280]  I mean, I'm at people like, why aren't you going after Crenshaw more?
[2:52:03.280 --> 2:52:07.520]  I mean, he is, I don't know how the hell he won a seat in Texas.
[2:52:07.520 --> 2:52:10.960]  No, I mean, I'm telling you, Alex, because I teased Ted Cruz.
[2:52:10.960 --> 2:52:14.920]  I was a little mad at Ted Cruz, because listen, you know, when the power went out, I had to
[2:52:14.920 --> 2:52:19.080]  pay for my mom's hotel for five days at the Holiday Inn Express, because her apartment,
[2:52:19.080 --> 2:52:21.840]  we had rolling blackouts the first time that's ever happened in my life.
[2:52:21.840 --> 2:52:25.160]  And listen, he's allowed to go on his vacation, but he went to Cancun and then realized how
[2:52:25.160 --> 2:52:27.440]  bad of a look it was and flew back the next day.
[2:52:27.440 --> 2:52:31.720]  So I just want to call him out and I'm going to actually see Ted Cruz in Tampa at the turning
[2:52:31.720 --> 2:52:32.720]  point event.
[2:52:32.720 --> 2:52:35.080]  And I'm going to go and try to talk to him in a very calm manner.
[2:52:35.080 --> 2:52:38.800]  I'm not going to call him out, but Dan Crenshaw, I'm saying, I got kicked back for Ted Cruz.
[2:52:38.800 --> 2:52:41.160]  I got no kickback for Dan Crenshaw.
[2:52:41.160 --> 2:52:47.880]  I mean, Ted Cruz is a lot better than I think Ted Cruz overall is good.
[2:52:47.880 --> 2:52:50.880]  He has some problems, but no Crenshaw is really, really bad news.
[2:52:50.880 --> 2:52:54.160]  I mean, look, Saturday Night Live loves him.
[2:52:54.160 --> 2:52:55.160]  All of them love him.
[2:52:55.160 --> 2:52:56.160]  What does that tell you?
[2:52:56.160 --> 2:52:57.160]  All right.
[2:52:57.160 --> 2:52:58.160]  Very powerful information.
[2:52:58.160 --> 2:52:59.160]  Let's take another call.
[2:52:59.160 --> 2:53:01.800]  Let's talk to Brandon in California.
[2:53:01.800 --> 2:53:02.800]  Let's go, Brandon.
[2:53:02.800 --> 2:53:03.800]  Welcome, Brandon.
[2:53:03.800 --> 2:53:04.800]  Hello, Alec.
[2:53:04.800 --> 2:53:05.800]  Yes, sir.
[2:53:05.800 --> 2:53:06.800]  I'm going to be live from Cami, Fornia.
[2:53:06.800 --> 2:53:07.800]  Listen, I just wanted to say that as much as I like Trump, he's pretty old, he's 76.
[2:53:07.800 --> 2:53:08.800]  And I don't care who you are.
[2:53:08.800 --> 2:53:22.300]  They're in a man over 60 that ain't somewhat senile.
[2:53:22.300 --> 2:53:28.360]  And I don't know if, I mean, he's got the backing, he's got the support, and he is sort
[2:53:28.360 --> 2:53:36.200]  of a savant in some ways, but I don't know if he has the discernment to really tackle
[2:53:36.200 --> 2:53:41.320]  the new world order because it is a scientific, I mean, these are mad scientists who are trying
[2:53:41.320 --> 2:53:47.960]  to openly depopulate the planet, take over, and I don't know if he can open his eyes to
[2:53:47.960 --> 2:53:48.960]  that.
[2:53:48.960 --> 2:53:55.640]  I mean, he just doesn't seem to be too awake to that reality, so I don't know.
[2:53:55.640 --> 2:53:56.640]  I don't know, man.
[2:53:56.640 --> 2:53:57.640]  I think we need someone younger.
[2:53:57.640 --> 2:54:03.360]  I think we need someone fiery, someone maybe in their 40s or 50s, but what do you think
[2:54:03.360 --> 2:54:05.360]  of the Santas?
[2:54:05.360 --> 2:54:06.360]  The Santas?
[2:54:06.360 --> 2:54:08.840]  I mean, yeah, I think he's solid.
[2:54:08.840 --> 2:54:13.360]  I think, I think if anything, Trump should just give back him up, give him all the support.
[2:54:13.360 --> 2:54:15.360]  Yeah, that's like Alex Stein said, be a kingmaker.
[2:54:15.360 --> 2:54:19.880]  Well, regardless, it comes from very sources, high-level sources that talk directly with
[2:54:19.880 --> 2:54:20.880]  Trump.
[2:54:20.880 --> 2:54:24.760]  He is currently planning to announce 2024 run on July 4th.
[2:54:24.760 --> 2:54:27.720]  Now, he may change that, but currently, that's the big news.
[2:54:27.720 --> 2:54:31.720]  Well, he's got to run, he's got to run on more than just picking the economy and the
[2:54:31.720 --> 2:54:32.720]  border.
[2:54:32.720 --> 2:54:37.440]  He's got to run hard against these ancient reptilian vampires at the top of the pyramid,
[2:54:37.440 --> 2:54:45.160]  and he needs a team of people that can help him see that and try to actually legally,
[2:54:45.160 --> 2:54:48.520]  you know, pursue justice because these people are legit murderers.
[2:54:48.520 --> 2:54:49.520]  I hear you.
[2:54:49.520 --> 2:54:50.520]  Great points, Brandon.
[2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:51.520]  Thanks for holding.
[2:54:51.520 --> 2:54:52.520]  Let's jam on another call.
[2:54:52.520 --> 2:54:54.920]  Let's talk to Joel in California.
[2:54:54.920 --> 2:54:56.320]  You're on the air with Alex Stein.
[2:54:56.320 --> 2:54:57.320]  Go ahead.
[2:54:57.320 --> 2:54:58.320]  Yeah, in California.
[2:54:58.320 --> 2:54:59.320]  Exactly.
[2:54:59.320 --> 2:55:03.560]  Alex, before we talk, I really just want to say I want to thank you for being one of
[2:55:03.560 --> 2:55:08.720]  the only people that fucking celebrates God unabastically, unapologetically, years fucking
[2:55:08.720 --> 2:55:09.720]  up.
[2:55:09.720 --> 2:55:10.720]  Please don't cuss again.
[2:55:10.720 --> 2:55:11.720]  I'll let you go.
[2:55:11.720 --> 2:55:12.880]  We already had to delay it twice.
[2:55:12.880 --> 2:55:13.880]  Just don't cuss again.
[2:55:13.880 --> 2:55:15.440]  I do celebrate God.
[2:55:15.440 --> 2:55:17.000]  I'm not perfect, but I know God's real.
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  I want to be on God's side.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:19.000]  I want to be with Jesus.
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  You're absolutely right.
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:25.840]  What's your view on Trump reportedly set to announce 2024 run next Monday?
[2:55:25.840 --> 2:55:30.080]  I absolutely apologize for doing that, and I regret it.
[2:55:30.080 --> 2:55:34.960]  But I think that the status is sort of being used against Trump.
[2:55:34.960 --> 2:55:36.680]  Go ahead.
[2:55:36.680 --> 2:55:40.280]  Well, I think he's at a point that they are they are pinning them against each other,
[2:55:40.280 --> 2:55:45.000]  trying to, you know, eat their own that that is the strategy the less is using 100%.
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:46.000]  So you're on the edge.
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  All we want to hear your take.
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  Go ahead.
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:52.160]  Yeah, I'm being a little bit reserved because I I'm almost afraid I'm going to curse again
[2:55:52.160 --> 2:55:54.120]  because I've been on hold for over 45 minutes.
[2:55:54.120 --> 2:55:57.760]  And I don't know if you've ever called into a radio show before when you were young and
[2:55:57.760 --> 2:55:58.760]  I'm not.
[2:55:58.760 --> 2:55:59.760]  You're fired up, brother.
[2:55:59.760 --> 2:56:00.760]  You're on the air now.
[2:56:00.760 --> 2:56:01.760]  We all have called in.
[2:56:01.760 --> 2:56:03.520]  Alex is called into a radio show.
[2:56:03.520 --> 2:56:06.000]  Yes, we've both called into radio shows in our life.
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:07.000]  Yes.
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:11.200]  I've been directly tweeted directly to DeSantis and told them that, like, yes, even though
[2:56:11.200 --> 2:56:17.000]  you are the better candidate on paper, you're being used against Donald Trump, who is the
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:18.240]  more effective candidate.
[2:56:18.240 --> 2:56:20.040]  They're more afraid of Trump.
[2:56:20.040 --> 2:56:25.080]  They can use you against the Republican Party.
[2:56:25.080 --> 2:56:30.480]  But you do have concerns about Trump or you don't honestly, no, I think that they're
[2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:34.160]  so afraid of Trump that they show that, like, he's the most effective candidate.
[2:56:34.160 --> 2:56:38.680]  They're the concerns that they express show their fear.
[2:56:38.680 --> 2:56:40.320]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[2:56:40.320 --> 2:56:45.000]  We're going to do five more minutes with honey and Bob, honey Bob, Bob, honey on the other
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:47.920]  side of Alex Stein 99.

[2:57:47.520 --> 2:57:53.160]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex Jones was right.
[2:57:53.160 --> 2:57:55.160]  People ask what's it like to be vindicated?
[2:57:55.160 --> 2:58:00.320]  Well it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming I tried to stop it
[2:58:00.320 --> 2:58:05.560]  and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[2:58:05.560 --> 2:58:11.880]  the globalist aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents it's now out on the
[2:58:11.880 --> 2:58:12.880]  open.
[2:58:12.880 --> 2:58:17.880]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[2:58:17.880 --> 2:58:24.000]  group so now the fights out in the open they're making their move because they know they're
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:25.120]  behind schedule.
[2:58:25.120 --> 2:58:26.120]  We're going to win this thing.
[2:58:26.120 --> 2:58:29.720]  God's watching the children counting on us I just want to thank the viewers and listeners
[2:58:29.720 --> 2:58:33.760]  for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you
[2:58:33.760 --> 2:58:37.720]  info wars would not be here so I want you to really internalize the fact that you are
[2:58:37.720 --> 2:58:42.880]  the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance so I want to thank you
[2:58:42.880 --> 2:58:47.560]  and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[2:58:47.560 --> 2:58:54.520]  At this point best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all and if we don't
[2:58:54.520 --> 2:59:00.680]  turn it around soon then it will only get worse but as bad as things are we still have
[2:59:00.680 --> 2:59:05.560]  time to prepare and that alone is something to be grateful for.
[2:59:05.560 --> 2:59:11.200]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean healthy water even in the event of your
[2:59:11.200 --> 2:59:16.920]  taps getting shut off and having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in

[2:59:31.800 --> 2:59:38.560]  having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration whoever sows bountifully will

[2:43:39.220 --> 3:00:39.400]  our guest a little bit of the next segment career of that exclusive with trump
[3:00:39.400 --> 3:00:46.120]  insider roger stone says you ready to run getting ready to announce it next week honey
[3:00:46.120 --> 3:00:51.640]  in new york here on the air with alex tan and alex jones go ahead hi alex god bless
[3:00:51.640 --> 3:00:59.400]  you thank you for having me i wanted to discuss trump running again and can you hear me i
[3:00:59.400 --> 3:01:05.320]  absolutely can't hear you honey go ahead thank you so much i think first he does have to
[3:01:05.320 --> 3:01:13.240]  go through a mea culpa immediately actually he has to if he is elected he has to pardon
[3:01:13.240 --> 3:01:19.080]  the people that were in january six that have pled guilty just to get out of solitary confinement
[3:01:19.080 --> 3:01:25.640]  the nonviolent people who were escorted through the capitol by the police by the capitol police
[3:01:25.640 --> 3:01:31.280]  and some of them are even still in prison today in dc they are political prisoners and he
[3:01:31.280 --> 3:01:37.320]  has to address that immediately the second other mea culpa is you guys you know uh page
[3:01:37.320 --> 3:01:43.320]  and zero milo yonapolis you god and laura lumar the discrimination against conservatives
[3:01:43.320 --> 3:01:49.160]  speaking in social media losing their jobs losing their businesses he has to address
[3:01:49.160 --> 3:01:54.720]  that you guys put him in office the first time and all of you are now these outcasts
[3:01:54.720 --> 3:02:00.080]  in the shadow and that's not right because you all got him elected and you may get him
[3:02:00.080 --> 3:02:06.080]  elected again and he has to address that secondly the mistakes of the lockdown and the mandatory
[3:02:06.080 --> 3:02:13.720]  vaccination he started that we need to have better controls better legislation on something
[3:02:13.720 --> 3:02:21.360]  like this happening again any virus will potentially kill immuno compromise and elderly people
[3:02:21.360 --> 3:02:28.240]  any virus could do that we cannot shut down the country and then have mandatory vaccines
[3:02:28.240 --> 3:02:31.760]  after six well honey i totally agree with you and i'm not trying to endorse trump because
[3:02:31.760 --> 3:02:35.760]  i've had a lot of problems with him but i'll say this the democrats have a cult that would
[3:02:35.760 --> 3:02:41.040]  drink cyanide if joe biden told him to with trump his base the rallies is mad about the
[3:02:41.040 --> 3:02:45.480]  shot if he got back in there's no way his base is putting up with him trying more of
[3:02:45.480 --> 3:02:50.160]  this what do you think alex stein thanks for the call honey no i mean alex you just nailed
[3:02:50.160 --> 3:02:53.400]  it i mean the trump could fix all these problems he could pardon julie in the songs he could
[3:02:53.400 --> 3:02:57.320]  fix the january six problem and you know within his first week in office so that's why he
[3:02:57.320 --> 3:03:01.800]  is going to be a great candidate if he went i mean nobody's perfect you know he got some
[3:03:01.800 --> 3:03:06.200]  bad advice from people trying to appease to both sides but i think if he gets trump two
[3:03:06.200 --> 3:03:10.640]  point oh the sequel will be will be better than the original in my opinion but i'd be
[3:03:10.640 --> 3:03:15.240]  happy with the sanis who else do you like out there as a republican candidate alex that's
[3:03:15.240 --> 3:03:19.400]  all alex that's it we got this and this and we got trump but the sad thing is none of
[3:03:19.400 --> 3:03:23.600]  that matters in two thousand mules these people can cheat again and they can you know some
[3:03:23.600 --> 3:03:27.040]  other disease and come out so that's the thing is the game is rigged in their favor their
[3:03:27.040 --> 3:03:30.840]  fingers on the scale so we could have the best candidate in the world we could have alex
[3:03:30.840 --> 3:03:34.800]  jones you could be running for president and they wouldn't let you win i'm serious so you
[3:03:34.800 --> 3:03:39.280]  know this it doesn't matter how likable and how popular you are at john o trump clearly
[3:03:39.280 --> 3:03:42.920]  was more popular than joe biden if you go and you see all these men on the street videos
[3:03:42.920 --> 3:03:47.240]  not just the ones i do but anybody else does if you ask the black community the asian community
[3:03:47.240 --> 3:03:51.880]  mexico it doesn't matter what community white community they all say they miss trump because
[3:03:51.880 --> 3:03:58.120]  they do not like paying five dollars a gallon of gas so trump was liked then he still liked
[3:03:58.120 --> 3:04:03.000]  but sadly they can rig the game and they can have that's right well in closing how does
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:07.160]  everybody not that we gotta look for it it's all over the place it's by the censors you're
[3:04:07.160 --> 3:04:13.120]  overpowering them with your shears comedy and will how do people find alex stein online

[3:04:25.640 --> 3:04:29.520]  how we do need somebody in office hopefully disantis hopefully trump that will reinstate

[3:05:32.400 --> 3:05:36.120]  and wars that were things happening is one of the most important as you can make is to
[3:05:36.120 --> 3:05:40.360]  have high quality storeable food water filtration air filtration more and it's not just those
[3:05:40.360 --> 3:05:44.520]  items it's hundreds of other high quality preparedness items and survival items right
[3:05:44.520 --> 3:05:50.680]  now and prepare with alex dot com that again redirects to prepare today dot com i would
[3:05:50.680 --> 3:05:53.560]  not procrastinate ladies and gentlemen one of the most important things you can do is
[3:05:53.560 --> 3:06:11.320]  get ahead of inflation now because the inflation is just beginning
[3:06:11.320 --> 3:06:16.040]  everybody knows that i know crowd walls everybody knows that ninety five percent of the time
[3:06:16.040 --> 3:06:23.840]  i tell you it's gotta be true Donald trump told a certain well-known political operative
[3:06:23.840 --> 3:06:31.840]  news conference with him three days ago he's gonna announce for president 2024 monday in
[3:06:31.840 --> 3:06:38.000]  five days the implications of that are massive i was hit during the rogerstone interview
[3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:44.080]  by that and shocked then i made some behind the scenes connections and confirmed but trump
[3:06:44.080 --> 3:06:52.200]  calls it technical technical flexibility he may not do it on monday but we know he's doing
[3:06:52.200 --> 3:06:57.920]  it he is running just that fact is so ultra massive i'm gonna take a final call from
[3:06:57.920 --> 3:07:02.160]  bob in texas and we'll go to cape dally great co-host knocks out of the park every week
[3:07:02.160 --> 3:07:05.920]  i hate to cut under a time choice this is amazing guest we're gonna go to her here in a few minutes
[3:07:05.920 --> 3:07:11.000]  but i want to play a few minutes from that hour one interview that's now an info wars
[3:07:11.000 --> 3:07:17.000]  dot com a band of it i hope you share i think he announces sooner rather than later i think
[3:07:17.000 --> 3:07:23.000]  he announces as early as july i think these kind of attacks probably accelerate that
[3:07:23.000 --> 3:07:28.120]  if anything desantis needs to stick to his knitting and get re-elected governor before
[3:07:28.120 --> 3:07:33.200]  he could move out openly in a presidential campaign i do think he is uh... sizing up
[3:07:33.200 --> 3:07:38.500]  taking on the champ new national poll last week out of mclaughlin and associates in the
[3:07:38.500 --> 3:07:44.720]  gateway punnett shows that trump easily dispatches all commerce is his race to lose in all honesty
[3:07:44.720 --> 3:07:48.720]  out as i've said here on the program before i expected the president to wait till after
[3:07:48.720 --> 3:07:54.600]  the midterms but to become a candidate fairly early uh... i now believe that he could be
[3:07:54.600 --> 3:08:00.240]  accelerating uh... his time frame because all of these attacks on him need to be seen
[3:08:00.240 --> 3:08:04.240]  in the context of the political attacks there are uh... and the reason they're attacking
[3:08:04.240 --> 3:08:09.360]  him is because they don't want him to run so therefore he will defy them i think by
[3:08:09.360 --> 3:08:13.360]  running i do think it could be as early as the first week of july
[3:08:13.360 --> 3:08:19.800]  and then we went on and had discussions on and off air trump is prepared to pull the
[3:08:19.800 --> 3:08:24.480]  trigger on monday that that's the plan
[3:08:24.480 --> 3:08:27.560]  big news ladies and gentlemen he may change his mind
[3:08:27.560 --> 3:08:29.520]  but it is certainly gigantic
[3:08:29.520 --> 3:08:34.320]  ultramassive news all right bob we held into the fourth hour to get to you i appreciate
[3:08:34.320 --> 3:08:41.400]  you holding bob in my home state of texas here on the air
[3:08:41.400 --> 3:08:47.280]  i can hear you talk right the phone
[3:08:47.280 --> 3:08:50.400]  i've been waiting to talk to you for so long
[3:08:50.400 --> 3:08:51.360]  uh...
[3:08:51.360 --> 3:08:52.520]  but i believe
[3:08:52.520 --> 3:08:54.600]  everything that that that
[3:08:54.600 --> 3:08:55.360]  i've been
[3:08:55.360 --> 3:08:56.200]  learning
[3:08:56.200 --> 3:08:57.240]  from you
[3:08:57.240 --> 3:09:02.120]  you and roger stone i think really really should
[3:09:02.120 --> 3:09:03.040]  work on
[3:09:03.040 --> 3:09:04.280]  president trump
[3:09:04.280 --> 3:09:07.320]  and i call him president trump could be still with
[3:09:07.320 --> 3:09:09.820]  the legitimate president
[3:09:09.820 --> 3:09:12.360]  as far as i'm concerned
[3:09:12.360 --> 3:09:16.560]  you need to talk to him to to try to get him to dump
[3:09:16.560 --> 3:09:18.280]  the idea of
[3:09:18.280 --> 3:09:20.040]  of the shot
[3:09:20.040 --> 3:09:21.520]  uh...
[3:09:21.520 --> 3:09:23.560]  if you get
[3:09:23.560 --> 3:09:25.920]  get him to get rid of that
[3:09:25.920 --> 3:09:27.640]  uh... really really
[3:09:27.640 --> 3:09:28.960]  bank that
[3:09:28.960 --> 3:09:32.120]  he's got it i mean i i'll vote for him
[3:09:32.120 --> 3:09:34.040]  because he's already helped
[3:09:34.040 --> 3:09:35.400]  our country
[3:09:35.400 --> 3:09:39.160]  he he he has done more than anybody
[3:09:39.160 --> 3:09:40.440]  in
[3:09:40.440 --> 3:09:44.760]  the last fifty years i'm i'm sixty nine exactly you can't because i was already
[3:09:44.760 --> 3:09:47.960]  really mad at trump but you can't discount the rovey wade victory
[3:09:47.960 --> 3:09:49.520]  you can't discount the border
[3:09:49.520 --> 3:09:50.800]  the china deal
[3:09:50.800 --> 3:09:54.480]  i mean it trump did so much good that's why it's so painful
[3:09:54.480 --> 3:09:57.480]  that he's wrong about the poison shot you're absolutely right bob what else
[3:09:57.480 --> 3:09:59.280]  would you like to add
[3:09:59.280 --> 3:09:59.960]  uh...
[3:09:59.960 --> 3:10:04.280]  just that they keep doing what you do and i i i i this is the first time i've

[3:11:56.040 --> 3:11:57.600]  takes over for the next
[3:11:57.600 --> 3:12:01.120]  forty nine minutes really appreciate her kate dally and then i would show your
[3:12:01.120 --> 3:12:03.000]  three p.m. central
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:07.400]  all thank you alex and really appreciate it i have so much today to get to do
[3:12:07.400 --> 3:12:10.280]  uh... let me let me just say this we're gonna go over a lot of things that can
[3:12:10.280 --> 3:12:12.680]  help right now that you can actually do
[3:12:12.680 --> 3:12:17.280]  to stop this great reset and to implement the people's reset right
[3:12:17.280 --> 3:12:20.320]  but before i get there i just want to mention a few things because all my
[3:12:20.320 --> 3:12:21.400]  gosh i feel like
[3:12:21.400 --> 3:12:24.760]  all all i've been doing is kind of clearing up misnomers
[3:12:24.760 --> 3:12:28.600]  uh... the rovers is weighed it was a bad opinion that lasted for forty nine
[3:12:28.600 --> 3:12:31.720]  years the court corrected it
[3:12:31.720 --> 3:12:35.120]  the actual americans would be glad you would think
[3:12:35.120 --> 3:12:37.320]  that the court corrected themselves
[3:12:37.320 --> 3:12:40.760]  but no no not when there's a vested interest to murder
[3:12:40.760 --> 3:12:43.760]  here is the slight of hand though and i think this is what people are
[3:12:43.760 --> 3:12:47.160]  understanding about the rovers is way this is so important because we can take
[3:12:47.160 --> 3:12:47.880]  action
[3:12:47.880 --> 3:12:50.680]  and we could take action for forty nine years
[3:12:50.680 --> 3:12:51.920]  that's the lie
[3:12:51.920 --> 3:12:56.400]  for forty nine years we could have done all kinds of things on the right
[3:12:56.400 --> 3:12:57.840]  to stop abortion
[3:12:57.840 --> 3:12:58.960]  within the states
[3:12:58.960 --> 3:13:00.200]  but we didn't do it
[3:13:00.200 --> 3:13:03.040]  for forty nine years and the reason i say this and you can
[3:13:03.040 --> 3:13:06.280]  you can really look at this and understand why i'm saying this why do
[3:13:06.280 --> 3:13:07.840]  you think we got the heartbeat bill
[3:13:07.840 --> 3:13:11.120]  why do you think states started pushing and i've been interviewing states for
[3:13:11.120 --> 3:13:15.720]  five years on the changes they've been making to go up against rovers is weighed
[3:13:15.720 --> 3:13:16.800]  why
[3:13:16.800 --> 3:13:21.400]  because the states finally figured out oh my gosh we had the power all along
[3:13:21.400 --> 3:13:23.680]  it was a lie this whole ruling
[3:13:23.680 --> 3:13:26.960]  there was never a ruling there was then never anything federal
[3:13:26.960 --> 3:13:31.000]  the supreme court aren't a bunch of emperors they can't put out an edict
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:32.400]  they can't make law
[3:13:32.400 --> 3:13:33.600]  they never could
[3:13:33.600 --> 3:13:36.680]  they could only give you an opinion on a texas case
[3:13:36.680 --> 3:13:40.800]  and then what they did in the media and in government is to tell you that it
[3:13:40.800 --> 3:13:42.360]  could never be touched
[3:13:42.360 --> 3:13:43.440]  not true
[3:13:43.440 --> 3:13:47.280]  the state started figuring this out and so what the court did was
[3:13:47.280 --> 3:13:52.160]  expose the fact that the forty nine years worth of stalling
[3:13:52.160 --> 3:13:55.280]  actually this could have happened forty nine years ago
[3:13:55.280 --> 3:13:56.160]  but it hasn't
[3:13:56.160 --> 3:13:58.040]  so right now is a great time
[3:13:58.040 --> 3:13:59.560]  to urge your
[3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:02.440]  uh... your right okay the right
[3:14:02.440 --> 3:14:04.600]  i'm on i'm on the right to on the right
[3:14:04.600 --> 3:14:08.360]  to go in and make resolutions on their constitutions
[3:14:08.360 --> 3:14:10.160]  uh... banning abortion
[3:14:10.160 --> 3:14:13.840]  because the trigger laws aren't going to do it completely we need to absolutely
[3:14:13.840 --> 3:14:16.000]  do uh... resolutions here
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:21.440]  and implement that into our constitution state constitutions so for the last forty
[3:14:21.440 --> 3:14:25.360]  nine years as the right have been running on pro-life right they convince you
[3:14:25.360 --> 3:14:29.080]  the pro-life and then they go and maybe they are and then they say uh... all my
[3:14:29.080 --> 3:14:30.120]  hands are tied
[3:14:30.120 --> 3:14:31.880]  the hands were never tied
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:34.880]  whether it's naive whether it's ignorance who knows whether it's
[3:14:34.880 --> 3:14:36.160]  intentional
[3:14:36.160 --> 3:14:37.680]  for forty nine years
[3:14:37.680 --> 3:14:42.640]  the media has read has reported scotus ruling on rovers's weight is a ruling
[3:14:42.640 --> 3:14:45.120]  it is not a ruling it is an opinion
[3:14:45.120 --> 3:14:48.640]  and for forty nine years all along and you should be very angry at that
[3:14:48.640 --> 3:14:49.800]  because
[3:14:49.800 --> 3:14:53.480]  we have been lied to for forty nine years in since in telling us that we
[3:14:53.480 --> 3:14:55.560]  couldn't do a darn thing about it
[3:14:55.560 --> 3:14:59.080]  all i just makes me so upset it was also a sleight of hand so that you would
[3:14:59.080 --> 3:15:00.600]  not look at the gun bill
[3:15:00.600 --> 3:15:05.680]  because really and truly it was a win that rovers's weight was overturned in
[3:15:05.680 --> 3:15:06.900]  the court
[3:15:06.900 --> 3:15:08.960]  that's that's a win
[3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:12.160]  and it exposed the states that's another win
[3:15:12.160 --> 3:15:16.640]  so now we have to take it the extra mile now and uh... and also you should be
[3:15:16.640 --> 3:15:20.280]  angry that you were lied to for forty nine years as well the states always had
[3:15:20.280 --> 3:15:24.480]  the power it sailed uh... so so the other side of hand was not looking at the
[3:15:24.480 --> 3:15:25.280]  gun bill
[3:15:25.280 --> 3:15:26.600]  the red flag bill
[3:15:26.600 --> 3:15:27.600]  this bill
[3:15:27.600 --> 3:15:31.320]  is a liberty taker this bill is going to do the damage because the mental health
[3:15:31.320 --> 3:15:33.640]  umbrella is so big on this
[3:15:33.640 --> 3:15:36.760]  and because it's the universal snitch law

[3:20:14.640 --> 3:20:18.640]  cate dally your host from the cate dally show cate dally radio dot com
[3:20:18.640 --> 3:20:22.080]  you know i said as we're going to break i never in any of my health care visits
[3:20:22.080 --> 3:20:24.400]  did i ever have to discuss the murder of a baby
[3:20:24.400 --> 3:20:28.080]  it really is a tragedy that they're calling it health care
[3:20:28.080 --> 3:20:32.240]  truly um and you know i'm not young so
[3:20:32.240 --> 3:20:35.920]  give me a break right um and if women are so desperate to get rid of their
[3:20:35.920 --> 3:20:39.360]  babies just get the covet shots it'll do it
[3:20:39.360 --> 3:20:43.760]  all those miscarriages over 200 of them right
[3:20:43.760 --> 3:20:49.600]  uh in the test yes so uh why is america a she and i just wanted to explain this
[3:20:49.600 --> 3:20:53.360]  quick history lesson for you um if you didn't realize this before we always
[3:20:53.360 --> 3:20:57.200]  refer to this country as a she and maybe this is a good lesson for all those
[3:20:57.200 --> 3:21:00.720]  liberal progressive uh you know pink hat wearing uh
[3:21:00.720 --> 3:21:06.400]  kombu bat wearing uh you know monsters um is that the feminine reference in
[3:21:06.400 --> 3:21:09.040]  latin because the earth was actually seen as a rich
[3:21:09.040 --> 3:21:12.960]  source of food and nurture for all of our forebears
[3:21:12.960 --> 3:21:17.680]  so we refer to the planet as mother earth just like we do america as a she
[3:21:17.680 --> 3:21:22.080]  isn't that interesting because my gosh it's uh it's all about
[3:21:22.080 --> 3:21:25.680]  the giving and the nurturing and the source right
[3:21:25.680 --> 3:21:29.360]  is the mother i'm sure women are listening to this liberal women if
[3:21:29.360 --> 3:21:33.600]  there's any um that are just cringing oh how dare they
[3:21:33.600 --> 3:21:38.400]  gotta call it an it anyway a country is one's place for birth and the idea of a
[3:21:38.400 --> 3:21:42.000]  birth is actually directly linked to motherhood for
[3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:46.080]  obvious reasons and it also symbolized as a female
[3:21:46.080 --> 3:21:51.040]  whose pride must be protected there's a lot of pride in these females
[3:21:51.040 --> 3:21:54.640]  and uh it's a shame because i can't imagine people running to go
[3:21:54.640 --> 3:21:58.480]  to go murder a baby or wanting to in the future really thinking it out
[3:21:58.480 --> 3:22:01.840]  i mean that's pretty that's pretty sick is it not
[3:22:01.840 --> 3:22:05.120]  um so nothing has changed women can still get as many abortions as they
[3:22:05.120 --> 3:22:08.960]  want so make sure and go to resolutions in your state constitutions
[3:22:08.960 --> 3:22:13.200]  and then you can see whether the people that ran on pro life really meant it
[3:22:13.200 --> 3:22:17.600]  i like that kind of test the red flag the bipartisan of course it's bipartisan
[3:22:17.600 --> 3:22:21.920]  it's all touchy feely over the aisle can we sit on each other's laps and rub
[3:22:21.920 --> 3:22:25.520]  each other down because we're all friends and buddies and we have no
[3:22:25.520 --> 3:22:28.560]  morals or principles that's the new meaning of bipartisan
[3:22:28.560 --> 3:22:32.560]  bipartisan safer communities act 15 traders of course and i know you've
[3:22:32.560 --> 3:22:36.640]  heard tons about this but it really was a wet blanket gun victory
[3:22:36.640 --> 3:22:41.280]  and they didn't say that not that permits were not bad they didn't say that the law
[3:22:41.280 --> 3:22:44.480]  was bad they only talked about the enforcement
[3:22:44.480 --> 3:22:48.400]  of that and so it's a win but it could have been a
[3:22:48.400 --> 3:22:53.360]  bigger win and same with roe vs wade could have been
[3:22:53.360 --> 3:22:57.120]  maybe i don't know admitting that they had lied i don't know for 49 years
[3:22:57.120 --> 3:23:00.960]  um i don't know i i just know that we need to seek out
[3:23:00.960 --> 3:23:04.160]  bigger wins than what we've been that what we've been given we cannot be
[3:23:04.160 --> 3:23:08.960]  complacent and just go along and say we've won because then people stop
[3:23:08.960 --> 3:23:12.400]  fighting and they think it's gone away and uh people were saying abortion is
[3:23:12.400 --> 3:23:15.520]  over no it's not it's alive and well in america right now
[3:23:15.520 --> 3:23:20.640]  and a lot of people are wanting to do it and so a sergeant of arms is dead after
[3:23:20.640 --> 3:23:23.200]  testifying that professional agitators were there
[3:23:23.200 --> 3:23:28.480]  on january 6 he died of the whistleblowing disease
[3:23:28.480 --> 3:23:33.120]  and uh michael stanger rest in peace uh worked as the u.s sergeant of arms
[3:23:33.120 --> 3:23:36.640]  right and of course all the news i just wanted to point out they're all saying
[3:23:36.640 --> 3:23:39.840]  he just died just died natural causes don't look here
[3:23:39.840 --> 3:23:46.080]  never mind right okay um i also wanted to mention that senator mitch mcconnell
[3:23:46.080 --> 3:23:50.080]  that goofy that goofy guy was uh the majority you know majority leader at
[3:23:50.080 --> 3:23:53.760]  the time requested stanger's resignation the day after
[3:23:53.760 --> 3:23:58.560]  this happened kind of interesting oh i just love his testimony though
[3:23:58.560 --> 3:24:03.120]  and uh it lives on also at january 6 i have to throw something to Todd
[3:24:03.120 --> 3:24:07.120]  Todd Starnes coming up on the season finale of j6 the movie
[3:24:07.120 --> 3:24:10.640]  Cassidy's friend sally testified she heard from her cousin luan
[3:24:10.640 --> 3:24:14.720]  that her mother uh claris overheard that her hairdresser tell her boyfriend
[3:24:14.720 --> 3:24:19.200]  that a mall cop intercepted i i just love that because that's
[3:24:19.200 --> 3:24:22.560]  exactly what it's turned into the whole country's seeing it and it's it's
[3:24:22.560 --> 3:24:26.720]  absolutely asinine the entire thing where are all the injuries
[3:24:26.720 --> 3:24:30.800]  where are all the footage of people actually getting assaulted i mean it's
[3:24:30.800 --> 3:24:38.800]  absolutely a lie i also um wanted to talk to about uh about the
[3:24:38.800 --> 3:24:43.360]  that the 18 things i have in order to help what we can do
[3:24:43.360 --> 3:24:47.280]  um not to mention by the way 58 babies who received
[3:24:47.280 --> 3:24:50.560]  COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are suffering life-threatening
[3:24:50.560 --> 3:24:54.400]  injuries right now stop taking the shot it's evil to give this to your
[3:24:54.400 --> 3:24:58.800]  children um what we need to do and i've talked a lot
[3:24:58.800 --> 3:25:02.400]  about these types of things on the radio and
[3:25:02.400 --> 3:25:05.440]  as more and more come out i think you're going to find some of these really
[3:25:05.440 --> 3:25:10.080]  really enlightening number one um lieutenant mark basha
[3:25:10.080 --> 3:25:15.760]  may of 2022 um went and and had to have a court
[3:25:15.760 --> 3:25:19.680]  marshal right for refusing to take the injections whatsoever okay
[3:25:19.680 --> 3:25:23.440]  my friend robin openshaw told me about this and she was really looking into
[3:25:23.440 --> 3:25:28.000]  this story and the trial convicted him okay for not obeying orders
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:34.720]  but with zero penalties whatsoever so really it has no teeth in fact i know
[3:25:34.720 --> 3:25:38.800]  somebody that didn't take the shot and they were sent to the pentagon and
[3:25:38.800 --> 3:25:42.960]  then given promotion after promotion there's no teeth
[3:25:42.960 --> 3:25:47.200]  they're playing chicken so play chicken do it
[3:25:47.200 --> 3:25:52.160]  you probably will win and so that is the big lesson the conviction was a
[3:25:52.160 --> 3:25:55.280]  toothless paper tiger it didn't do anything
[3:25:55.280 --> 3:25:59.040]  we cannot play this game with them and do what
[3:25:59.040 --> 3:26:02.560]  they say we have to stand up for what's right and you know what
[3:26:02.560 --> 3:26:06.080]  sometimes really with the cost you know we think the cost is going to be your
[3:26:06.080 --> 3:26:10.640]  job maybe not maybe not so in this case
[3:26:10.640 --> 3:26:15.680]  absolutely go with your gut and stand up and this was a
[3:26:15.680 --> 3:26:20.880]  a wonderful you know um person in the in the army and has done an
[3:26:20.880 --> 3:26:25.440]  amazing job and he had this amazing legacy people loved him
[3:26:25.440 --> 3:26:30.160]  and he stood up and nothing happened so i just wanted people to know that um
[3:26:30.160 --> 3:26:34.320]  that that you can stand up i also want to bring up this too
[3:26:34.320 --> 3:26:38.160]  you know when when the cows all died well not all but in in kansas when we had
[3:26:38.160 --> 3:26:41.360]  10 000 cow deaths that were very mysteriously weird
[3:26:41.360 --> 3:26:45.280]  because i can see three or four thousand ten thousand wow that's a lot
[3:26:45.280 --> 3:26:49.360]  you know i brought up the fact that farmers should start to co-op
[3:26:49.360 --> 3:26:53.440]  we should start taking money out of the stock market and putting it into farmers
[3:26:53.440 --> 3:26:58.640]  investing in farming so that not only do we have a stake in our own food later on
[3:26:58.640 --> 3:27:02.320]  when we really really need it but also the fact that these farmers
[3:27:02.320 --> 3:27:06.320]  are dying out and they are an awesome breed i love the farmers and ranchers
[3:27:06.320 --> 3:27:09.680]  of america i always call them the salt of the earth because they truly are
[3:27:09.680 --> 3:27:13.360]  they are the backbone of america they are what america was built on because we
[3:27:13.360 --> 3:27:17.680]  used to be 95 percent farming and and ranching so the ones that are left are
[3:27:17.680 --> 3:27:20.240]  really struggling and having a really tough time buying
[3:27:20.240 --> 3:27:24.880]  120 000 tractors and of course the cost of fuel and everything else
[3:27:24.880 --> 3:27:27.680]  and when they lose a crop it's pretty devastating
[3:27:27.680 --> 3:27:32.640]  we cannot afford as a country to let them die to let them go
[3:27:32.640 --> 3:27:37.760]  we have to maintain them or we only are going to be solely looking at gates'
[3:27:37.760 --> 3:27:41.280]  land and the government land for our food sources
[3:27:41.280 --> 3:27:46.080]  and the fact that they just gene edited in march cows for shorter hair to um
[3:27:46.080 --> 3:27:50.400]  they they crispered up some cows with shorter hair to resist the heat
[3:27:50.400 --> 3:27:54.240]  i am telling you if we don't do something for these farmers and do it quick
[3:27:54.240 --> 3:27:57.680]  we're going to lose them because they are teetering right now
[3:27:57.680 --> 3:28:02.240]  and if we could co-op them if we could go in on the cost for cows if we could go
[3:28:02.240 --> 3:28:05.840]  in on the cost for tractors the cost for fuel if we could
[3:28:05.840 --> 3:28:09.760]  take our money out of the wall street that we know is going to crash
[3:28:09.760 --> 3:28:12.720]  and put it into our future food for our future family
[3:28:12.720 --> 3:28:17.200]  now that's called a return because you're going to get food out of that
[3:28:17.200 --> 3:28:21.680]  and the farmers retain ownership they still own their farm
[3:28:21.680 --> 3:28:25.200]  just be an investor just be somebody that helps out
[3:28:25.200 --> 3:28:28.960]  we have to come up with some solutions right now and we're all standing around
[3:28:28.960 --> 3:28:32.640]  watching our country burn and watching these farmers go out of existence and
[3:28:32.640 --> 3:28:36.240]  once they're out they're out for good they do not come back
[3:28:36.240 --> 3:28:39.600]  and so this these lands have been in their families for years and years and
[3:28:39.600 --> 3:28:44.480]  years do not let them do not let their business die
[3:28:44.480 --> 3:28:47.520]  please we have got to save our own food supply
[3:28:47.520 --> 3:28:51.840]  and we have to shore up the backbone of america i'm k dally i'll be right back

[3:30:40.400 --> 3:30:43.520]  what fish oil is

[3:33:01.760 --> 3:33:05.280]  it's alex jones
[3:33:11.280 --> 3:33:14.880]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm kate dally your guest host from the kate
[3:33:14.880 --> 3:33:18.480]  dally show and let me just tell you get those supplements and get yourself some
[3:33:18.480 --> 3:33:22.640]  food storage right now alex is right you need to stock up right now they'll
[3:33:22.640 --> 3:33:25.360]  keep on the shelf all those supplements to just make sure that
[3:33:25.360 --> 3:33:28.560]  you're getting them and make sure you have them because as we look at shortages
[3:33:28.560 --> 3:33:31.680]  it might be harder and harder to get them we have a pretty short window
[3:33:31.680 --> 3:33:36.400]  to basically get things and right now i would say is the perfect time
[3:33:36.400 --> 3:33:41.760]  to absolutely know that you are short up in health and food and everything
[3:33:41.760 --> 3:33:46.480]  so i was talking about farmers and how we could help farmers because we're just
[3:33:46.480 --> 3:33:49.280]  honestly standing around watching our country burn
[3:33:49.280 --> 3:33:52.480]  there are things we can do to take action and i'm just going to tell you a
[3:33:52.480 --> 3:33:55.840]  whole bunch of things that you could do i'm really into practical answers been
[3:33:55.840 --> 3:33:58.560]  thinking a lot about these things things we can do
[3:33:58.560 --> 3:34:02.240]  but number one with that sleight of hand the reason they wanted to dazzle
[3:34:02.240 --> 3:34:06.320]  everybody with the rovers is weighed when even though really they were just
[3:34:06.320 --> 3:34:09.760]  exposing that you could have all along for 49 years
[3:34:09.760 --> 3:34:13.760]  i'm done what we're about to do with our states but we need to go further
[3:34:13.760 --> 3:34:17.440]  they did not want you to see the red flag bill the
[3:34:17.440 --> 3:34:24.000]  bipartisan bill and that bill is the snitch bill any x employee any political
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:27.760]  group that doesn't like somebody on the radio or doesn't like somebody on tv
[3:34:27.760 --> 3:34:30.240]  saying things can actually just make a phone call
[3:34:30.240 --> 3:34:34.720]  or the police can just make it up and go in and they can come take your guns
[3:34:34.720 --> 3:34:39.280]  without a trial without due process and that is so harmful so make sure
[3:34:39.280 --> 3:34:42.160]  that and you can see where that's going to go right
[3:34:42.160 --> 3:34:46.080]  that's the way in is to take our guns they knew we'd never give them up
[3:34:46.080 --> 3:34:49.440]  so you know what you take them and you call everybody else everybody a mental
[3:34:49.440 --> 3:34:53.280]  health risk remember georgia georgia passed that law
[3:34:53.280 --> 3:34:57.920]  on that basically changed the language to a harm to oneself where you could be
[3:34:57.920 --> 3:35:01.520]  committed against your will to a harm in the future
[3:35:01.520 --> 3:35:06.400]  in the future at some point in the future you could be a harm to someone or
[3:35:06.400 --> 3:35:11.120]  something remember that because the other states are going to do it too
[3:35:11.120 --> 3:35:15.520]  then we're really in trouble because anything could be considered mental
[3:35:15.520 --> 3:35:18.880]  health so make sure you're going in and getting a resolution
[3:35:18.880 --> 3:35:23.040]  to the constitution in your state constitution against
[3:35:23.040 --> 3:35:27.200]  the taking of your guns by the feds the taking of your guns because there's a
[3:35:27.200 --> 3:35:30.320]  lot of money going to flow in to pay the states and pay them off just like covid
[3:35:30.320 --> 3:35:33.360]  bucks so so we have to make resolution so that
[3:35:33.360 --> 3:35:36.720]  you get your due process they have to go through proper channels
[3:35:36.720 --> 3:35:40.160]  the other thing is this you know we're talking a lot about gas
[3:35:40.160 --> 3:35:43.360]  why aren't the states saying we have our own domestic
[3:35:43.360 --> 3:35:47.360]  oil supply within our states and we're going to make sure
[3:35:47.360 --> 3:35:52.960]  our people that live in our states get the get the decent price
[3:35:52.960 --> 3:35:56.240]  why are we always saying that it's up to the feds and up to the
[3:35:56.240 --> 3:36:01.040]  king fraud a lot administration the states certainly can exercise some
[3:36:01.040 --> 3:36:03.920]  sovereignty on this they certainly have oil
[3:36:03.920 --> 3:36:06.960]  everywhere and they certainly can make agreements
[3:36:06.960 --> 3:36:10.080]  if for some reason they don't they can make an agreement with a state that's
[3:36:10.080 --> 3:36:13.600]  already set up for domestic oil they absolutely
[3:36:13.600 --> 3:36:16.800]  could define what we're paying for gas right now
[3:36:16.800 --> 3:36:20.240]  if they wanted to so where's our state sovereignty where's our governors with a
[3:36:20.240 --> 3:36:25.840]  backbone right it's hard to find it's really sad
[3:36:25.840 --> 3:36:30.080]  like my own my own is like super feminine and totally weird
[3:36:30.080 --> 3:36:33.520]  but i'm stuck with them right we're stuck with these guys and so
[3:36:33.520 --> 3:36:37.520]  a lot of heat and a lot of pressure that we need to put on these guys but they
[3:36:37.520 --> 3:36:39.920]  absolutely could control that if they wanted to
[3:36:39.920 --> 3:36:43.680]  same with montana nebraska and south dakota all three of those states are
[3:36:43.680 --> 3:36:48.080]  republican why are they not passing their section of the pipeline
[3:36:48.080 --> 3:36:51.280]  why is there no heat on these states to do this
[3:36:51.280 --> 3:36:56.400]  they absolutely could do that why are we always putting the ball in king
[3:36:56.400 --> 3:37:00.880]  fraud a lot's court there's no reason for it
[3:37:00.960 --> 3:37:04.400]  um also your county commissioners in your county
[3:37:04.400 --> 3:37:08.320]  could say hey don't pay for gas i mean i'm sorry tax on gas
[3:37:08.320 --> 3:37:12.320]  don't pay for registration fees there's a lot of fees and a lot in
[3:37:12.320 --> 3:37:15.360]  nonsense that i think is unconstitutional anyway
[3:37:15.360 --> 3:37:19.520]  but they could absolutely step up and say don't pay those things until
[3:37:19.520 --> 3:37:24.320]  until this is over right so that so that they can urge it along to get to kind
[3:37:24.320 --> 3:37:27.360]  of come to a head so we can get some lower prices
[3:37:27.360 --> 3:37:32.080]  but why why not do that a county could stand apart from the state
[3:37:32.080 --> 3:37:35.280]  they've done it before why can't they do it now
[3:37:35.280 --> 3:37:40.320]  they absolutely can do it and so you can put heat on your local county
[3:37:40.320 --> 3:37:43.360]  commissioners because you have that ability same with election fraud
[3:37:43.360 --> 3:37:46.960]  the county commissioners in the country are the ones that can absolutely go to
[3:37:46.960 --> 3:37:50.480]  bat and change the system for how you vote
[3:37:50.480 --> 3:37:53.520]  so if you put any pressure on them at all to do that
[3:37:53.520 --> 3:37:57.760]  i call ours uh locally uh mani mo and jack because they're so
[3:37:57.760 --> 3:38:01.920]  idiotic they won't do a thing and we have to keep pushing and pushing and
[3:38:01.920 --> 3:38:04.400]  pushing show up at those county meetings
[3:38:04.400 --> 3:38:09.120]  show up and say i want you to change uh election all this election fraud that's
[3:38:09.120 --> 3:38:12.400]  going on and i want to be i wanted i don't want
[3:38:12.400 --> 3:38:15.520]  mail-in voting because it causes fraud and i want to be in person
[3:38:15.520 --> 3:38:18.320]  and you should be demanding it in these counties
[3:38:18.320 --> 3:38:22.880]  um also support movies that do not support the woke agenda by looking to
[3:38:22.880 --> 3:38:26.320]  see what the movies have in them like buzz lightyear
[3:38:26.320 --> 3:38:29.680]  i'm so glad that flopped it totally deserved it disney's gone
[3:38:29.680 --> 3:38:33.120]  totally jumped the shark and it's sickening what they're doing to a
[3:38:33.120 --> 3:38:36.560]  little mickey mouse isn't it um the the little woke agenda
[3:38:36.560 --> 3:38:40.640]  also what we can be doing on the right is making a hell of a lot more movies
[3:38:40.640 --> 3:38:45.440]  like 2000 mules put your money there in the awakening of people to understand
[3:38:45.440 --> 3:38:48.960]  what's really going on these people always need your support
[3:38:48.960 --> 3:38:53.120]  and movies like top gun if you really want to go see a holly holly weird movie
[3:38:53.120 --> 3:38:56.160]  go see something like top gun that doesn't have any woke agenda in it
[3:38:56.160 --> 3:38:59.280]  the only message there is i'm old but i still matter
[3:38:59.280 --> 3:39:03.920]  so so go see those i mean people flock to that movie for a reason
[3:39:03.920 --> 3:39:08.080]  they wanted nothing with politics in it
[3:39:08.080 --> 3:39:12.080]  oh man what a lesson what a lesson they won't learn from that lesson every
[3:39:12.080 --> 3:39:15.920]  all women cast movie will fail every woke agenda will fail
[3:39:15.920 --> 3:39:19.520]  and um and now we have uh i can't remember her name the little itty bitty
[3:39:19.520 --> 3:39:23.680]  star from star wars is trying to bulk up for to be Thor right
[3:39:23.680 --> 3:39:27.920]  a woman Thor and she's like five foot one i'm sorry how much can you seriously
[3:39:27.920 --> 3:39:31.920]  bulk up and if you have to bulk up aren't you trying to be more manly
[3:39:31.920 --> 3:39:36.320]  so ridiculous anyway it's asinine also here's another one
[3:39:36.320 --> 3:39:40.880]  my friend bought a truth truck a truth truck this is a truck with solar panels
[3:39:40.880 --> 3:39:44.320]  and messages and so she delivers messages about the
[3:39:44.320 --> 3:39:47.280]  vaccines messages about all kinds of things
[3:39:47.280 --> 3:39:51.280]  um and she drives that truck around and parks it in certain areas so people
[3:39:51.280 --> 3:39:54.560]  can get these messages it's like a moving billboard
[3:39:54.560 --> 3:39:58.080]  why do not why do uh why aren't more people
[3:39:58.080 --> 3:40:01.680]  doing this why aren't we why aren't we owning billboards
[3:40:01.680 --> 3:40:07.040]  why are we not putting out truth messages to counteract the lying scumbags
[3:40:07.040 --> 3:40:11.040]  and and and whore bags in media why are we not doing this
[3:40:11.040 --> 3:40:13.840]  we have so many things in our arsenal but we don't do them
[3:40:13.840 --> 3:40:17.200]  we don't do them we sit and watch our country burn and then we complain
[3:40:17.200 --> 3:40:21.280]  there's no room for complaining um and so truth trucks
[3:40:21.280 --> 3:40:24.400]  everybody every city in america should have a truth truck
[3:40:24.400 --> 3:40:27.760]  go in on it get a group to go in on it raise money for it whatever you have to
[3:40:27.760 --> 3:40:31.360]  do we want to do a car wash great let's fund those
[3:40:31.360 --> 3:40:34.560]  because if people don't hear these messages like the fact that we didn't
[3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:37.680]  have you know one new cemetery in the year 2020 so
[3:40:37.680 --> 3:40:41.680]  what did they do with 500 000 bodies i mean satellite would have picked up
[3:40:41.680 --> 3:40:44.400]  big burnings so i'm pretty sure they didn't do that
[3:40:44.400 --> 3:40:48.000]  anyway we need to do something about getting the truth out okay
[3:40:48.000 --> 3:40:51.760]  and then also homesteading lowering property tax right
[3:40:51.760 --> 3:40:56.240]  um following the procedures uh print out a declaration of homesteading
[3:40:56.240 --> 3:41:01.440]  it's a huge one here's another one for land too so vital i i hope everybody in
[3:41:01.440 --> 3:41:04.160]  america is going to really listen to this right now
[3:41:04.160 --> 3:41:08.000]  you bought a home and all you got was a warranty deed
[3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:11.520]  a warranty deed doesn't do anything the mortgage company thought they could
[3:41:11.520 --> 3:41:15.600]  get away with giving you a warranty deed what you really need is a land
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:19.360]  patent because the government owns what's under your ground
[3:41:19.360 --> 3:41:23.920]  not you they do if you have a land patent and it's a
[3:41:23.920 --> 3:41:27.200]  matter of paperwork and it's a matter of going in and doing the
[3:41:27.200 --> 3:41:30.640]  paperwork ron gibson my friend man he's been doing this for 40 years and
[3:41:30.640 --> 3:41:35.520]  teaching all about it all over america if you go in for the land patent you
[3:41:35.520 --> 3:41:39.200]  own everything under that land much harder to take your home from you
[3:41:39.200 --> 3:41:42.320]  when they collapse our economy and want to do so
[3:41:42.320 --> 3:41:45.760]  a land patent all you have is a warranty deed you need
[3:41:45.760 --> 3:41:50.800]  a land patent that is so vital i can't even tell you
[3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:54.320]  because all of us were taught to think that a warranty deed was all we needed
[3:41:54.320 --> 3:41:58.320]  and it's not you must get a land patent okay
[3:41:58.320 --> 3:42:01.600]  if you really want to own your home so that they can't take it
[3:42:01.600 --> 3:42:05.520]  homesteading is just another option and go look up homesteading and what you
[3:42:05.520 --> 3:42:07.840]  do is you follow the procedures to print out
[3:42:07.840 --> 3:42:11.600]  a declaration of homesteading really really important
[3:42:11.600 --> 3:42:14.640]  to do some of these things because and look into them
[3:42:14.640 --> 3:42:17.840]  because if we don't we're just sitting here waiting
[3:42:17.840 --> 3:42:21.200]  for the collapse i mean come on can't we do more
[3:42:21.200 --> 3:42:24.880]  we have to get prepared for a people's reset
[3:42:24.880 --> 3:42:29.520]  we have to be the ones that say no to their great reset why aren't companies
[3:42:29.520 --> 3:42:34.000]  developing lines of loans and funding for those that do not accept the woke
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:37.120]  agenda because the woke agenda companies are the only ones that are going to be
[3:42:37.120 --> 3:42:40.080]  funded in the future in the great reset that's what it's all about
[3:42:40.080 --> 3:42:44.320]  that's why they're going to bat for the glitter and the sparkle
[3:42:44.320 --> 3:42:47.760]  and the you know everything's gay in june is because they're proving their
[3:42:47.760 --> 3:42:51.680]  wokeness so they can get future money i'll be right back i'm k deli your

[3:47:12.000 --> 3:47:15.360]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm so glad to be here with you
[3:47:15.360 --> 3:47:19.440]  i'm k dally from the k dally show your guest host and always appreciate
[3:47:19.440 --> 3:47:23.440]  coming in at each week to share with you some of the things i've learned i've
[3:47:23.440 --> 3:47:27.520]  been studying and really wanted to bring some solutions to you today
[3:47:27.520 --> 3:47:31.280]  because i felt like we're standing around we don't know what to do we feel
[3:47:31.280 --> 3:47:35.040]  like we can't do anything as one person you'd be so surprised what you can do
[3:47:35.040 --> 3:47:38.800]  as one person it reminds me the old video where the guy is dancing
[3:47:38.800 --> 3:47:41.840]  and he's dancing in a crowd and the whole crowd is looking at him like he has
[3:47:41.840 --> 3:47:45.840]  two heads and then all of a sudden another person
[3:47:45.840 --> 3:47:48.240]  joins him and then all of a sudden the people
[3:47:48.240 --> 3:47:50.880]  start not looking at him like he has two heads but
[3:47:50.880 --> 3:47:54.000]  another person joined him and then pretty soon everybody was
[3:47:54.000 --> 3:47:56.560]  was dancing and that's kind of how this works
[3:47:56.560 --> 3:48:00.480]  we have to lead out we've got to be lions right now we cannot be
[3:48:00.480 --> 3:48:04.240]  we cannot be little mice that just sit in the corner and are fretting and are
[3:48:04.240 --> 3:48:07.360]  worried and i know that's not you i absolutely love this audience because
[3:48:07.360 --> 3:48:11.040]  i know that's not you you want to do things to help this country because you
[3:48:11.040 --> 3:48:14.160]  love this country and as we're coming up on independence day
[3:48:14.160 --> 3:48:19.200]  and we need to call it independence day not july fourth we don't call christmas
[3:48:19.200 --> 3:48:24.160]  december 25th and take away all of its meaning call it independence day
[3:48:24.160 --> 3:48:28.400]  because it is independence day and you know are we celebrating it or
[3:48:28.400 --> 3:48:32.080]  memorializing it you know conor boyack said that to me this week and i said
[3:48:32.080 --> 3:48:35.040]  yeah you're right what are we doing you know as a country
[3:48:35.040 --> 3:48:39.120]  and so i i feel sad right now and i'm gonna feel sad on on
[3:48:39.120 --> 3:48:43.280]  independence day because i'm realizing what we're losing to the woke mobs and
[3:48:43.280 --> 3:48:46.400]  to utter stupidity and the total morons out there
[3:48:46.400 --> 3:48:49.680]  that have the microphone and we have to do more on this side
[3:48:49.680 --> 3:48:52.080]  and this is why i'm bringing all these solutions to you because these are
[3:48:52.080 --> 3:48:55.840]  things we can do um so no matter what happens
[3:48:55.840 --> 3:48:59.440]  no matter how this story plays out and if you read the scriptures you know how
[3:48:59.440 --> 3:49:02.320]  it plays out we're still responsible for everything
[3:49:02.320 --> 3:49:06.400]  we do so we have to just keep doing it
[3:49:06.400 --> 3:49:10.560]  that's the answer so here's some more one of the things i always talk about is
[3:49:10.560 --> 3:49:14.560]  water because i live in a desert and water is such a big deal and they call it
[3:49:14.560 --> 3:49:18.880]  liquid gold and then the the counties are always seeking to
[3:49:18.880 --> 3:49:22.320]  fine tune that's what they call it when they want to gouge you some more with
[3:49:22.320 --> 3:49:26.800]  more taxes for it is fine tune the regulations
[3:49:26.800 --> 3:49:29.920]  so that you're paying a hilt for this for this water
[3:49:29.920 --> 3:49:34.400]  but primary water is earth-generated water and nobody ever talks about it
[3:49:34.400 --> 3:49:37.680]  nobody you can go to primarywater.org and find out more about it
[3:49:37.680 --> 3:49:41.840]  but when conditions are right the oxygen combines with hydrogen to make new
[3:49:41.840 --> 3:49:44.640]  water this water is being pushed up
[3:49:44.640 --> 3:49:48.880]  under great pressure from very very deep in the earth it's very renewable and it
[3:49:48.880 --> 3:49:51.840]  never ends and it finds its way towards the
[3:49:51.840 --> 3:49:55.120]  surface of the earth where there are fissures or or faults
[3:49:55.120 --> 3:49:58.880]  and depending on the geology primary water can be close to the surface
[3:49:58.880 --> 3:50:03.040]  or it can be and flow out as a spring or it can be very very very deep
[3:50:03.040 --> 3:50:08.560]  okay and so how can we access it well the origins of primary water are deep
[3:50:08.560 --> 3:50:12.320]  because there's great pressure it moves upwards wherever possible
[3:50:12.320 --> 3:50:16.640]  and it also confronts a blocking geologic structure
[3:50:16.640 --> 3:50:21.200]  it will remain deep so you go into the weak areas of the earth's crust and it
[3:50:21.200 --> 3:50:24.240]  moves forward and it's and until it's blocked or finds a way
[3:50:24.240 --> 3:50:27.280]  to the surface these weaker areas are often
[3:50:27.280 --> 3:50:30.960]  sort of associated with mountain ranges where faults are common but it can
[3:50:30.960 --> 3:50:34.960]  also be in flat areas too and so these fresh water vents are
[3:50:34.960 --> 3:50:37.760]  there how do you think we got water all along it
[3:50:37.760 --> 3:50:40.720]  didn't just come from rainfall and snow how idiotic but that's what we're
[3:50:40.720 --> 3:50:43.040]  taught in school that's what the weathermen say
[3:50:43.040 --> 3:50:46.720]  right and that's what government says in fact my own governor was saying it
[3:50:46.720 --> 3:50:49.600]  such a moron it only comes from snowpack
[3:50:49.600 --> 3:50:53.600]  that's not true water comes from down deep
[3:50:53.600 --> 3:50:58.000]  as well and it's also pushed upward so you can get it from both angles
[3:50:58.000 --> 3:51:00.720]  and you have to know what you're doing to find it
[3:51:00.720 --> 3:51:04.960]  and it is the best water and it's also the water that could help us
[3:51:04.960 --> 3:51:09.440]  because I know as they try to promote human cause global climate change
[3:51:09.440 --> 3:51:13.360]  they're going to probably harp us into hotter and hotter weather
[3:51:13.360 --> 3:51:17.120]  well if that's the case water will be an issue
[3:51:17.120 --> 3:51:20.640]  if we're only going to rely on it the way we've relied on it and why do you
[3:51:20.640 --> 3:51:24.160]  think the government always wanted so much control over it
[3:51:24.160 --> 3:51:27.840]  the government really the state governments the counties
[3:51:27.840 --> 3:51:32.320]  they really wanted that control so that they could continue to charge us more
[3:51:32.320 --> 3:51:35.360]  and more money for it so there's such a game involved
[3:51:35.360 --> 3:51:39.040]  but we need to be smart enough to be able to find these and you can go to
[3:51:39.040 --> 3:51:42.240]  primarywater.org and learn more but we this is how lake
[3:51:42.240 --> 3:51:47.920]  elsinor was actually refilled was they went down deep into primary
[3:51:47.920 --> 3:51:50.960]  water to refill it so don't let anyone tell you they
[3:51:50.960 --> 3:51:54.480]  cannot do that before they've even looked into it because it's
[3:51:54.480 --> 3:51:57.680]  it's very possible and it's been going on for centuries okay
[3:51:57.680 --> 3:52:02.800]  veterans I talked about the the grid system this week and we have three
[3:52:02.800 --> 3:52:07.520]  major grids in our country we have a west coast we have
[3:52:07.520 --> 3:52:10.800]  texas and then we have an east coast and they're never
[3:52:10.800 --> 3:52:15.200]  ever secured they are not the congress won't do anything to secure them the
[3:52:15.200 --> 3:52:18.000]  states aren't doing much to come to us secure them
[3:52:18.000 --> 3:52:21.680]  and so they're very very vulnerable and what's interesting is we always think
[3:52:21.680 --> 3:52:24.320]  cyberattack but it's actually down on the list
[3:52:24.320 --> 3:52:28.640]  physical attack is really one of the higher reasons why we have problems
[3:52:28.640 --> 3:52:32.080]  with these stations if something goes wrong in the major
[3:52:32.080 --> 3:52:35.280]  stations that control the country and we also control Canada
[3:52:35.280 --> 3:52:38.800]  but if something goes wrong where do we get our parts
[3:52:38.800 --> 3:52:44.880]  China China yeah and it could take up to 18 months
[3:52:44.880 --> 3:52:52.720]  to get a new major part for for these stations for these grids
[3:52:52.720 --> 3:52:56.080]  and so when you think about that I was thinking we know what could we
[3:52:56.080 --> 3:52:58.960]  immediately do since they're not willing to do anything
[3:52:58.960 --> 3:53:02.720]  what about retired veterans that guard substations
[3:53:02.720 --> 3:53:05.920]  what about that because we we truly are not doing
[3:53:05.920 --> 3:53:09.840]  anything to secure the fact that we could be without
[3:53:09.840 --> 3:53:13.760]  with our country would come to a standstill very very very quickly
[3:53:13.760 --> 3:53:16.960]  so there are things we could do if we were willing to do them
[3:53:16.960 --> 3:53:20.000]  and why aren't states buying transformers now
[3:53:20.000 --> 3:53:23.200]  instead of waiting 18 months when one breaks
[3:53:23.200 --> 3:53:27.040]  right just like right now we should be buying a lot of car parts for our cars
[3:53:27.040 --> 3:53:30.880]  fuel pumps and tires and all those things because those are the things
[3:53:30.880 --> 3:53:34.560]  that that you're going to consistently need right
[3:53:34.560 --> 3:53:38.160]  and get them now before a shortage unveils itself
[3:53:38.160 --> 3:53:43.120]  makes sense to me but we need to push our states to buy transformers now
[3:53:43.120 --> 3:53:46.240]  to buoy up all of the substations in your state too
[3:53:46.240 --> 3:53:49.840]  besides even the major ones but the major ones yes could take up to 18
[3:53:49.840 --> 3:53:53.360]  months to get from china and do we have any companies here
[3:53:53.360 --> 3:53:59.920]  that make these no we don't no we don't sad
[3:53:59.920 --> 3:54:04.720]  so also here's another one doctors can step away from socialized
[3:54:04.720 --> 3:54:08.560]  NIH controlled medicine as we saw with remdesivir and their protocol
[3:54:08.560 --> 3:54:12.880]  and start their own clinics for the unvaxxed as more and more people are
[3:54:12.880 --> 3:54:16.000]  dying from the vaccination it's going to be very very clear
[3:54:16.000 --> 3:54:18.800]  that this is not something that you should take into your body as it's
[3:54:18.800 --> 3:54:22.160]  promoting you know heart attacks and strokes and vertigo and everything else
[3:54:22.160 --> 3:54:25.760]  so let's see doctors form their own clinics and if you want to put money
[3:54:25.760 --> 3:54:27.920]  into something put it into those clinics
[3:54:27.920 --> 3:54:31.440]  also if they come up with a mommy loves mommy book every five minutes come up
[3:54:31.440 --> 3:54:34.720]  with a book to contradict that a brand new book about
[3:54:34.720 --> 3:54:38.320]  mommies and daddies we have to be able to fight this war
[3:54:38.320 --> 3:54:42.160]  see they use bully groups to get into the schools it's always under the guise of
[3:54:42.160 --> 3:54:45.520]  of bullying and then they go in and they're very very pro
[3:54:45.520 --> 3:54:49.760]  lgbt and transgender to the kids but they always get in saying that they're
[3:54:49.760 --> 3:54:53.440]  against bullying so why don't we use that same tactic
[3:54:53.440 --> 3:54:56.480]  why don't we get in in under the guise of bullying
[3:54:56.480 --> 3:55:00.880]  and talk about the constitution and talk about um America and talk about the
[3:55:00.880 --> 3:55:04.240]  love for America and its founding why can't we do that
[3:55:04.240 --> 3:55:07.920]  um also blast the newspapers with op-eds
[3:55:07.920 --> 3:55:11.120]  they can't keep ignoring you they seem to want to ignore me
[3:55:11.120 --> 3:55:14.320]  but blast them with op-eds so that you can get
[3:55:14.320 --> 3:55:19.280]  your message out and keep sending op-eds and that's something anyone can do
[3:55:19.280 --> 3:55:23.520]  write an article um also don't go to the places where feds are surely going to
[3:55:23.520 --> 3:55:27.440]  show up um as we're consistently told i think
[3:55:27.440 --> 3:55:31.360]  it's the feds that are the professional agitators and so don't go and
[3:55:31.360 --> 3:55:34.560]  certainly don't bring your phone as they're going to net the whole entire
[3:55:34.560 --> 3:55:38.800]  area to see who you are and to know that know where you are
[3:55:38.800 --> 3:55:43.680]  um and also if you notice drills consistently going on within a school
[3:55:43.680 --> 3:55:47.680]  and it seems a little odd to you that the feds keep hanging around and swat
[3:55:47.680 --> 3:55:50.800]  keeps hanging around and ice keeps hanging around
[3:55:50.800 --> 3:55:54.960]  uh elementary school for another drill because this has happened
[3:55:54.960 --> 3:55:59.200]  start talking about it posting it exposing it get it on the net
[3:55:59.200 --> 3:56:02.400]  get that exposure on the net so people can see that yes
[3:56:02.400 --> 3:56:05.600]  the the feds were hanging around and hanging around and drilling there
[3:56:05.600 --> 3:56:09.040]  there was no reason for it right and you know what i'm talking about a
[3:56:09.040 --> 3:56:12.480]  particular elementary school um that had dozens and dozens of
[3:56:12.480 --> 3:56:16.000]  drills for no apparent reason and it starts with a you
[3:56:16.000 --> 3:56:19.760]  um also on the day you vote wouldn't it be interesting if we grabbed sharpies
[3:56:19.760 --> 3:56:23.760]  and wrote on our on our t-shirts wrote on our arms who we voted for
[3:56:23.760 --> 3:56:27.120]  so there was a very visual representation of who we voted for
[3:56:27.120 --> 3:56:30.400]  so that it couldn't just be oh no we just didn't get enough votes
[3:56:30.400 --> 3:56:36.240]  if you had pictures of who people like large groups everyone with the t-shirt
[3:56:36.240 --> 3:56:40.960]  ongoing i voted for you know what i mean for president or for governor wouldn't
[3:56:40.960 --> 3:56:43.440]  it be interesting to see the visuals of that
[3:56:43.440 --> 3:56:47.040]  how in the world could they conduct the fraud with so
[3:56:47.040 --> 3:56:51.040]  many representations of who people actually voted for
[3:56:51.040 --> 3:56:54.720]  i don't know maybe it's time to do that since they won't fix election fraud
[3:56:54.720 --> 3:56:59.040]  i don't know but i still i i don't want to see
[3:56:59.040 --> 3:57:02.800]  the fraud winners win anymore do you and maybe we
[3:57:02.800 --> 3:57:07.120]  truly need to do something a little different than just count on the machine
[3:57:07.120 --> 3:57:11.680]  which we all know is so corrupt i've been talking about those machines for six years
[3:57:11.680 --> 3:57:15.040]  they're so corrupt they either multiply a vote
[3:57:15.040 --> 3:57:19.520]  or they divide a vote in the back of the software and so if people had a visual
[3:57:19.520 --> 3:57:22.000]  representation of who they actually voted for
[3:57:22.000 --> 3:57:25.200]  um i don't know how you could fight that i don't know how you could contradict
[3:57:25.200 --> 3:57:28.800]  that anyway i hope these solutions helped
[3:57:28.800 --> 3:57:32.560]  and i hope that we look at each one of those as something that we could really
[3:57:32.560 --> 3:57:36.240]  do right now because we have got to save this country and as we go forward to
[3:57:36.240 --> 3:57:39.760]  independence day i'm always emotional in an independence day
[3:57:39.760 --> 3:57:43.600]  anyway because it's such a we have such a wonderful country let's save it let's
[3:57:43.600 --> 3:57:49.360]  protect it i'm k at this point best case scenario
[3:57:49.360 --> 3:57:54.720]  is a few years of hard times for us all and if we don't turn it around soon
[3:57:54.720 --> 3:57:58.880]  then it will only get worse but as bad as things are
[3:57:58.880 --> 3:58:04.320]  we still have time to prepare and that alone is something to be grateful for

[3:58:46.080 --> 3:58:49.840]  let's go ahead take another call let's talk to malcom in tennessee welcome
[3:58:49.840 --> 3:58:53.760]  hello alex yes malcom all right i will make this quick and real short where
[3:58:53.760 --> 3:58:57.840]  the other patricks can get on the line uh alex i have to promote one thing from
[3:58:57.840 --> 3:59:02.640]  one of your co-host oan shroyer supermail volatility and brain force
[3:59:02.640 --> 3:59:05.920]  plus mix those two together you're an unstoppable tank
[3:59:05.920 --> 3:59:09.680]  supermail volatility really really works it's cold pressed herbs
[3:59:09.680 --> 3:59:13.360]  and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so
[3:59:13.360 --> 3:59:17.120]  it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions
[3:59:17.120 --> 3:59:20.880]  that also work quite well but just aren't as strong this is like a very fine
[3:59:20.880 --> 3:59:24.320]  wine it's it's it's in fact each batch is different sometimes it's super
[3:59:24.320 --> 3:59:26.880]  strong sometimes it's just okay people like why are you selling
[3:59:26.880 --> 3:59:30.000]  something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong that's just how it is
[3:59:30.000 --> 3:59:34.960]  it's how it works uh so it's always good it's just sometimes it's like super
[3:59:34.960 --> 3:59:38.480]  strong but yeah if you want the rolls royce at a decent price
[3:59:38.480 --> 3:59:41.360]  then this is it
[3:59:47.440 --> 3:59:52.000]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[3:59:52.000 --> 3:59:57.600]  it's alex jones
