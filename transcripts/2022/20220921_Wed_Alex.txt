[00:25.280 --> 00:29.600]  With our government guilty of pushing a deadly experimental vaccine,
[00:29.600 --> 00:35.120]  robbing the nation of its wealth and starting a war with Russia who has a superior nuclear
[00:35.120 --> 00:42.640]  weapons arsenal, one has to ask, be it angry mobs or atom bombs, where do these crooks plan
[00:42.640 --> 00:48.160]  on escaping the fallout? Denver is now handing out free bug out bags to help you just in case
[00:48.160 --> 00:52.720]  you run into emergency. Lisa, all right, I asked you last time, I need to know the checklist of
[00:52.720 --> 00:58.000]  everything I got to put in my bug out bag. Toilet paper, paper towels, toilet paper, paper towels,
[00:58.000 --> 01:03.120]  we've got cotton balls, two opportunities to get these free emergency preparedness bags, so
[01:03.120 --> 01:07.440]  really an important effort, especially when we're talking about severe weather. Yeah, and I know a
[01:07.440 --> 01:11.520]  lot of people are going to go and get those bags, but for people who maybe can't make it out there,
[01:11.520 --> 01:14.640]  is there anything in there that's, you know, too tough that you couldn't just put one of those
[01:14.640 --> 01:18.560]  together yourself? Yeah, there's a lot of stuff you could easily put together yourself. I mean,
[01:18.560 --> 01:23.200]  if you got any extra cotton balls, you know, paper towels, toilet paper. The city of Denver
[01:23.200 --> 01:29.040]  is letting the locals know they should be prepared for an unexpected order to get out of town in a
[01:29.040 --> 01:35.600]  hurry. And many people are connecting dots between this and the Denver International Airport. The
[01:35.600 --> 01:41.840]  Denver International Airport has long been rumored to be sitting atop an underground military base
[01:41.840 --> 01:47.920]  built deep beneath the surface and connected to several other underground bases. These rumors
[01:47.920 --> 01:54.800]  are the result of several interesting facts. From 1995 until he was found dead a year later,
[01:54.800 --> 02:00.960]  Phil Schneider gave dozens of lectures claiming to be a geological engineer hired to build deep
[02:00.960 --> 02:08.320]  underground military bases known as DUMMS for the US government. His father was Captain Oscar
[02:08.320 --> 02:15.200]  Schneider, a former Nazi stationed in Florida working black operations for naval intelligence.
[02:15.200 --> 02:21.520]  Phil Schneider was showing samples of what he claimed were unknown exotic metals. He provided
[02:21.520 --> 02:28.400]  maps of the underground DUMMS and showed off dramatic scars that he claimed were from a violent
[02:28.400 --> 02:36.160]  skirmish with a non-human species deep underground. In January of 1996, Schneider was found dead in
[02:36.160 --> 02:42.320]  his home days after he mysteriously died of strangulation. Investigations were never completed
[02:42.320 --> 02:48.240]  and it was ruled a suicide. His evidence went missing. Before he died, Phil Schneider used his
[02:48.240 --> 02:53.840]  clearance to take investigative author Alex Christopher into the top underground levels
[02:53.840 --> 02:59.920]  of the Denver Airport where they took pictures of a long road heading off to multiple destinations.
[03:00.640 --> 03:08.160]  Built upon 53 square miles of land, 25 miles from downtown, the Denver Airport was billions of
[03:08.160 --> 03:14.240]  dollars over budget. Different contractors were hired for each section, some of whom have come
[03:14.240 --> 03:19.600]  forward and claimed it would take days to show you what's down there. Inside the otherwise
[03:19.600 --> 03:25.440]  unimpressive airport, there is a capstone with cryptic Illuminati and Masonic imagery
[03:25.440 --> 03:32.720]  marking a time capsule buried beneath to be opened in 2094. The airport opened with a famous
[03:32.720 --> 03:39.120]  four-piece mural depicting biological warfare, death and destruction, the surrender of all
[03:39.120 --> 03:45.440]  national sovereignty, and the emergence of a new religion. On the floor, for no apparent reason,
[03:45.440 --> 03:52.160]  is what appears to be the symbol for gold and silver in a mining cart, AU AG, which is also the
[03:52.160 --> 03:59.680]  abbreviation for a deadly strain of hepatitis discovered in 1965. Outside on the surface,
[03:59.680 --> 04:05.120]  the runways form the shape of a swastika and passengers are greeted by what has become known
[04:05.120 --> 04:11.680]  as Blucifer, a 32-foot horse with glowing red eyes that reportedly killed its creator when a
[04:11.680 --> 04:17.040]  piece of the sculpture came loose and severed an artery in his leg. This is why many people
[04:17.040 --> 04:22.400]  are talking about Denver's Bug Out Bag Program, which is good because now that we know who the
[04:22.400 --> 04:28.080]  people committing these historic crimes against humanity are, we can't just let them slip away
[04:28.080 --> 04:32.400]  into some hole somewhere. Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:43.920 --> 04:50.560]  Of course, you can find that Greg Rees video at band.video, Bug Out Bags, Underground Bases,
[04:50.560 --> 04:59.520]  and the Denver International Airport. Share it with your friends and spur the great awakening.
[05:01.760 --> 05:05.760]  InfoWars work has never been having a bigger effect than it's having right now,
[05:06.400 --> 05:12.480]  and today is do or die time. If InfoWars gets the funding into the midterms in the next year,
[05:12.480 --> 05:15.280]  we're going to stay on air and be more effective than ever. But if we don't,
[05:15.280 --> 05:21.200]  I respect your decision and I'm ready to basically implode and shut down our main operations.
[05:21.760 --> 05:27.280]  I've done my work. I've put everything into it. I'm leaving it all in the field. But I believe
[05:27.280 --> 05:31.920]  at a gut level, you're going to come through, plus you're going to get great products that your
[05:31.920 --> 05:37.120]  family already need. So don't procrastinate. Show InfoWars. You want to stay on the air.
[05:37.120 --> 05:42.160]  Go to infowarsstore.com where we got three great products back in stock. Vitamin C and zinc,
[05:42.160 --> 05:47.760]  highest quality, super strong, back in stock. Vitamin D3 and calcium, and of course,
[05:47.760 --> 05:54.640]  DNA Force Plus. All these products are 50% off together in a combo pack or 40% off individually.
[05:54.640 --> 05:58.480]  So the great products you already need for your immune system and we need the money to stay on
[05:58.480 --> 06:14.960]  air. So please take action now. Thank you.
[06:14.960 --> 06:29.440]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news today.
[06:29.440 --> 06:36.560]  Live from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now your host, Owen
[06:36.560 --> 06:49.760]  Troyer. What you got? What you got? I got soul. I'm super bad. I got soul. You got soul. We got
[06:49.760 --> 06:58.080]  soul. And we're not going to allow our souls to be conquered by a bunch of lying demonic scum
[06:59.280 --> 07:02.480]  that run our government, run our media, want to run our country, run our lives,
[07:02.480 --> 07:10.880]  and run this planet into submission, not on our watch. And that's why we have been slated
[07:10.880 --> 07:15.040]  for destruction. That's why Alex Jones has been slated for destruction. And so while
[07:17.200 --> 07:22.720]  Alex Jones is currently in Connecticut, he does still have an emergency breaking report
[07:23.680 --> 07:31.520]  that he's just decided to do live on air in the next segment. So he wants me to let the audience
[07:31.520 --> 07:38.400]  know that's coming up in the next segment breaking news from Alex as he's in and out of court all day.
[07:42.320 --> 07:45.520]  And it's pretty amazing, isn't it? It's pretty amazing
[07:46.640 --> 07:54.080]  to be watching a completely tyrannical, rigged, politicized, weaponized
[07:54.080 --> 08:01.840]  justice system against opposition to tyranny, against opposition to Democrat party rule,
[08:04.000 --> 08:11.360]  against free speech. And that's truly what's going on here. Now,
[08:14.160 --> 08:22.240]  Infowars is obviously in a very interesting place right now, because we've been
[08:22.240 --> 08:29.040]  been deemed for destruction. The orders have been made that we must be destroyed. We must
[08:29.040 --> 08:33.200]  be taken off air. That's what the censorship has been about. That's what these lawsuits have been
[08:33.200 --> 08:39.200]  about. And yet we're still here every day. That's thanks to you shopping at InfowarsStore.com.
[08:40.400 --> 08:47.840]  And they don't know what to do about the money thing here because, I mean,
[08:48.560 --> 08:52.080]  they really think Infowars has a bunch of money. They really think Alex has hundreds
[08:52.080 --> 08:58.320]  of millions of dollars. We don't. And so they're frustrated because they now are learning
[08:59.840 --> 09:05.280]  that all this money they think Alex has just goes right back into the company and they can't get it.
[09:07.280 --> 09:15.200]  So now what do they do? Now what do they do? That's their question. That's their conundrum.
[09:17.200 --> 09:20.400]  They really thought they could take all Alex's money or take all the money that
[09:20.400 --> 09:24.560]  Infowars has in the bank, and that would end this whole entire thing. And that's just never
[09:24.560 --> 09:27.760]  how it's been. There isn't a bunch of money in the bank. All the money goes right back into
[09:27.760 --> 09:33.360]  the operation. So there's no money for them to take. And because that's the operational procedure here,
[09:34.720 --> 09:39.120]  Alex can actually file bankruptcy, file insolvency, and they can look and they can see,
[09:39.120 --> 09:43.280]  okay, yeah, you're really, the company's not making a profit and hasn't in years.
[09:43.280 --> 09:51.680]  But let me just say this ahead of Alex Jones joining us because this is the problem
[09:52.880 --> 10:00.720]  when Alex Jones is not on the air, even as informed and aware as this audience is,
[10:00.720 --> 10:03.040]  perhaps the most informed and aware audience on the planet,
[10:05.360 --> 10:12.400]  even still most people don't fully comprehend what's going on behind the scenes and they just
[10:12.400 --> 10:17.440]  tune in because they know that this is where you get the best information. And so if they tune in
[10:17.440 --> 10:22.800]  and Alex isn't on there, they tune right out. And maybe that's because they don't like me,
[10:22.800 --> 10:26.880]  but it's mostly just because they tune in to hear Alex. So you don't hear Alex, you tune out.
[10:27.680 --> 10:37.200]  And the problem is when that happens, the sales at infowarstore.com drop dramatically.
[10:37.200 --> 10:44.800]  And so let me just say this, if you're tuned in today, please consider some financial support
[10:44.800 --> 10:50.400]  at infowarstore.com because when Alex is away in court like this, sales are way down,
[10:52.240 --> 10:55.760]  you know, the listenership kind of fluctuates because more people tune in because they want
[10:55.760 --> 10:59.920]  to hear what's going on in the court case, but then sometimes they tune out when they see that
[10:59.920 --> 11:05.840]  it's not Alex Jones. So folks, please consider going to infowarstore.com, making a purchase
[11:05.840 --> 11:10.640]  today, whether it's one of our great supplements, whether it's the new book from Alex, the great
[11:10.640 --> 11:16.320]  reset in the war for the world, which is just still selling massively, still a top seller
[11:16.960 --> 11:23.120]  on Amazon for weeks on end now. We're still selling it on our website as well. Those sales are doing
[11:23.120 --> 11:30.240]  well. My friends that have gotten the book have since reached out to me and told me how much
[11:30.240 --> 11:37.520]  they enjoy it as far as it being a very powerful informational read, really arming them with
[11:37.520 --> 11:47.600]  knowledge and understanding. So that's a great way to support us financially, but also to arm
[11:47.600 --> 11:55.280]  yourself with the information and the intelligence that the tyrants that want to conquer you don't
[11:55.280 --> 12:02.720]  want you to have access to. So just remember that folks, don't take info wars for granted.
[12:03.760 --> 12:06.640]  Don't take Alex Jones for granted. Don't take this crew for granted.
[12:09.280 --> 12:13.040]  We say it a thousand times on air, but it's like until it happens, people don't understand how real
[12:13.040 --> 12:20.800]  it is. They want this shut down. They want this operation shut down every day. Just info wars being
[12:20.800 --> 12:30.240]  on air at this point is a victory against censorship. I mean, forget the fact that if you guys do a
[12:30.240 --> 12:37.440]  dot cam here, forget the fact that I've got enough information and research in front of me on my desk.
[12:37.440 --> 12:43.600]  I mean, it's absurd. You look at this desk for six hours of news. I am prepared to give you
[12:43.600 --> 12:51.920]  six hours of news today in the most hardcore info wars fashion. But quite frankly, that's just the
[12:51.920 --> 12:59.680]  cherry on top. That's just the gravy. Just info wars being on air, just you tuning in today,
[12:59.680 --> 13:04.480]  just the website still being live, just you sharing that link with your friends and family,
[13:04.480 --> 13:10.960]  just you saying a prayer for Alex and info wars. That is victory. That is already victory,
[13:10.960 --> 13:15.120]  just us showing up and being on air is victory. But we're not just going to show up. We're going
[13:15.120 --> 13:21.520]  to deliver at the end of the day. So just remember this, folks, don't take info wars for granted.
[13:21.520 --> 13:26.160]  Don't take Alex. Don't take this crew for granted. Go to infowarstore.com. Get yourself a great product
[13:26.160 --> 13:31.600]  and support free speech in the process. Now, Alex joining us on the other side, he's live on the
[13:31.600 --> 13:40.240]  scene in Connecticut from an undisclosed location. And you know, I don't want to be the one to cover
[13:40.240 --> 13:46.720]  the court case too much because I would rather Alex cover the case and then, you know, the other
[13:46.720 --> 13:50.640]  media following it covering the case. And I'll just focus on covering the news. But I will say this.
[13:52.880 --> 13:57.920]  The channel, the number one YouTube channel for legal battles,
[13:59.760 --> 14:07.520]  law and crime network has obviously been covering the last two Sandy Hook cases. And I was talking to,
[14:07.520 --> 14:10.080]  well, I don't even know if I want to say this because I want to get the individual in trouble.
[14:10.080 --> 14:15.280]  Let's just say I was talking to somebody who works there or let's just leave it at that.
[14:16.400 --> 14:25.040]  And he told me that the views and the interactions in these info wars cases on their network
[14:25.040 --> 14:29.920]  is the biggest they've ever had. And the only thing that really rivals it is the Johnny Depp
[14:29.920 --> 14:34.560]  Amber Heard thing, but the Alex Jones info wars stuff, most views, most comments they've ever had.
[14:34.560 --> 14:46.080]  Well, if you go now to their channel on YouTube, they have now blocked the comment section
[14:47.120 --> 14:50.880]  on all the Alex Jones court videos. The comment section is blocked.
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.640]  Now the excuse was given. Oh, threats are being made to the family. Well, if that's happening,
[14:56.640 --> 15:00.640]  then okay, shut down those accounts and let's investigate those individuals. We'd have no
[15:00.640 --> 15:06.160]  problem with that. We don't support that activity. We completely denounce that activity, always have.
[15:06.160 --> 15:09.920]  But so they just say, oh, a threat's been made to the family. So we're shutting off the comment
[15:09.920 --> 15:15.440]  section instead of identifying the individuals that do that and just shutting them down.
[15:15.440 --> 15:19.280]  And then you can go further if you want. That's not up to us. We don't support those individuals.
[15:19.840 --> 15:25.520]  But you know what? I'm not buying it. I believe the comment section has been turned off
[15:25.520 --> 15:32.080]  on a direct order from either YouTube or the Democrat party because nine out of 10 comments
[15:32.080 --> 15:36.320]  were in support of Alex Jones. Nine out of 10 comments were in support of info wars.
[15:36.320 --> 15:41.680]  Nine out of 10 comments were calling out this judge and this kangaroo court for the rig justice
[15:41.680 --> 15:48.560]  system that's going on, just like was the case in the Texas legal case. All the comments were
[15:48.560 --> 15:53.120]  in support of us in support of justice against the corrupt judge. And now because of that,
[15:53.120 --> 15:57.360]  they've shut down the comments on the rest of the videos. Alex Jones up next.
[16:00.880 --> 16:05.760]  The best selling book in America last week was the great reset and the war for the worlds
[16:05.760 --> 16:12.480]  written by Alex Jones. Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week. But the New York
[16:12.480 --> 16:15.360]  Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that. The New
[16:15.360 --> 16:19.920]  York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New York Times.
[16:19.920 --> 16:24.160]  The paper that started the Iraq war by lying about weapons mass destruction and got a million
[16:24.160 --> 16:29.360]  people killed. So they lied about his book. The great reset and the war for the world,
[16:29.360 --> 16:35.920]  the historic book that lays out the plans of the great reset Death Star and exposes
[16:35.920 --> 16:43.360]  the New World Order's plans for global enslavement. Get your copy now at amazon.com
[16:43.360 --> 16:51.360]  to keep the book at number one and infowarstore.com to help keep info wars on the air. The great reset
[16:51.360 --> 16:56.080]  and the war for the world by Alex Jones. Now, number one in the world.
[16:59.520 --> 17:05.840]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for cardiovascular system,
[17:05.840 --> 17:11.920]  for your brain, for every part of your body. But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that
[17:11.920 --> 17:19.120]  it has natural psychotropic effects. It certainly does for me. When I take a couple of these
[17:19.120 --> 17:25.600]  capsules an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing. Now, there are actually some studies
[17:25.600 --> 17:32.960]  out there linking it to amazing events in the brain. But I want you to experience it yourself.
[17:32.960 --> 17:36.480]  We know it's good for your heart. We know it's good for your brain. We know it's good for your
[17:36.480 --> 17:42.000]  arteries and veins and your lungs and every other function of your body. But I want you to experience
[17:42.000 --> 17:47.120]  this high grade fish oil, this ultimate fish oil at infowarstore.com and see what it does
[17:47.120 --> 17:54.800]  if you take it before bedtime. Ultimate fish oil 50% off now exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[17:54.800 --> 17:57.680]  Thank you all for your support. You're really going to miss out if you don't get it.
[17:57.680 --> 18:07.200]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean, this is from people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico,
[18:07.200 --> 18:12.000]  the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.800]  above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee. And yeah, we buy it from the
[18:16.800 --> 18:20.320]  little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune.
[18:20.320 --> 18:24.240]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it. And the farmers don't
[18:24.240 --> 18:27.600]  want the Mexican government take over. So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been
[18:27.600 --> 18:31.360]  buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff sold at Whole Foods
[18:31.360 --> 18:35.760]  under another name for about 50% more per pound. And I just think it's some of the best coffee
[18:35.760 --> 18:39.920]  you're going to find anywhere. It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels,
[18:39.920 --> 18:42.800]  literally. In fact, I'm going to tell you a little story.
[18:45.840 --> 18:51.760]  We had one. I think you wouldn't believe it. Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how
[18:51.760 --> 18:54.800]  we fund this operation. And if you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[18:59.520 --> 19:04.560]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans. They financed major
[19:04.560 --> 19:10.480]  universities. They ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda of New
[19:10.480 --> 19:16.880]  York Times, other major newspapers, that the family as we know it is a bad thing and must be ended.
[19:16.880 --> 19:21.680]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household teaching women that
[19:21.680 --> 19:26.480]  cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[19:26.480 --> 19:31.200]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national daughter. My
[19:31.200 --> 19:34.480]  wife makes dinner a lot of times. But I like to make it as well. I love to make breakfast.
[19:35.120 --> 19:39.360]  And literally, it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be
[19:39.360 --> 19:45.520]  nurtured. And then all sit down together and have the communal event. And that's what the system
[19:45.520 --> 19:50.640]  is attacking and bombarding is our normal biological actions and coming together. They
[19:50.640 --> 19:57.040]  really are sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that will domesticate us and turn us into lab rats.
[19:57.040 --> 19:58.720]  We cannot let this continue.
[19:58.720 --> 20:25.280]  Today, leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:25.280 --> 20:29.280]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[20:35.280 --> 20:38.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I come to you live from Connecticut.
[20:39.600 --> 20:46.560]  It is Wednesday, the 21st of September, 2022. And I'm not going to be talking right now
[20:46.560 --> 20:51.840]  about the attempts to shut down infowars and the concerted deep state efforts to silence us because
[20:51.840 --> 20:56.480]  that quite frankly, pales and significance will cover it some later is as important,
[20:56.480 --> 21:01.040]  but pales and significance compared to what's really going on. If you study history, if you
[21:01.040 --> 21:07.200]  study warfare, and you know even what the main line analysis is, this proxy war with Russia
[21:07.200 --> 21:13.120]  in Ukraine was always going to expand, and it was always going to escalate. And the most probable
[21:13.120 --> 21:21.680]  outcome is a limited nuclear war. We're talking about end of the civilization we've known,
[21:21.680 --> 21:27.520]  perhaps a human ending collapse. If you understand what will happen, there is even a limited nuclear
[21:27.520 --> 21:34.800]  war, a new ice age, 450 plus nuclear reactors melting down and exploding. Power outages in most
[21:34.800 --> 21:40.160]  of the world for years that will cause an estimated 4 billion people to die. We're talking zombie
[21:40.160 --> 21:47.120]  apocalypse for real. Ladies and gentlemen, Putin has done a partial mobilization of 300,000 troops.
[21:47.120 --> 21:52.080]  Putin has said, and the quotes are up on infowars.com, that he's not bluffing, and he's threatening
[21:52.080 --> 21:57.360]  nuclear war. The United States and others have pumped 70 plus billion dollars of high-tech weapons
[21:57.360 --> 22:02.800]  into Ukraine, and they are beating the Russians. Now, the West started the war eight years ago,
[22:02.800 --> 22:06.800]  overthrew the elected government there. I said, when Putin went in, I said, this is going to be
[22:06.800 --> 22:11.360]  a trap. We told you back in October that by the end of February, Russia was going to invade.
[22:11.360 --> 22:17.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now at war with Russia. U.S. troops and NATO troops leading
[22:17.920 --> 22:23.040]  Ukrainian troops are battling the Russians at point blank range, and they are defeating the
[22:23.040 --> 22:31.600]  Russians. Now, in any doctrine of war and modern warfare, this will respond, this will escalate,
[22:31.600 --> 22:36.880]  this will lead to something far worse. Now, the Serbian president and others have come out and said,
[22:36.880 --> 22:42.320]  when they talk to NATO officials and others, they expect a giant escalation of the war with
[22:42.320 --> 22:49.680]  direct warfare with Taipei assets, that means in the air, you name it, between NATO and Russia.
[22:49.680 --> 22:55.840]  So I'm going to say it again, NATO is now going in a slow burn, but once it hits Flashpoint, it explodes.
[22:55.840 --> 23:05.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to show you're here back live in the studio.
[23:06.400 --> 23:10.880]  Alex Jones' connection has frozen. We'll be monitoring that, hopefully having Alex back
[23:10.880 --> 23:15.600]  up any moment now. Okay, Alex is back live. Alex, we've got your connection back. Go ahead.
[23:18.240 --> 23:21.440]  How much should I get out, Owen? We only missed about 10 seconds.
[23:21.440 --> 23:29.360]  Okay, so when I was getting ready to travel here this weekend, I was talking to military
[23:29.360 --> 23:33.840]  folks, I was talking to DC sources, they were saying, man, they're really coming after you,
[23:33.840 --> 23:37.280]  stick in there. We don't know how you're taking it so well. And I said, listen,
[23:38.480 --> 23:43.840]  taking it well, I expect there's a good chance we can have a nuclear war while I'm in Connecticut,
[23:43.840 --> 23:46.560]  and I'm worried about getting back to Texas, taking care of my family.
[23:46.560 --> 23:54.080]  I'm not worried about any of this garbage. The real threat is the global depression that's
[23:54.080 --> 24:00.320]  already here, the massive inflation, millions of people getting heart attacks, microcarditis,
[24:00.320 --> 24:05.920]  including children. It being confirmed, it causes that. We have a psychotic elite in control of
[24:05.920 --> 24:10.720]  Big Pharma, the UN, our government that pushed deadly poison shots on children. They know a
[24:10.720 --> 24:15.120]  race through being systems. People need to understand that we're not at Kansas anymore,
[24:15.120 --> 24:20.320]  okay? And Russia has said that they're going to continue to escalate, they're not going to lose,
[24:20.320 --> 24:26.480]  and that they're ready to go to nuclear war, okay? So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen,
[24:26.480 --> 24:31.600]  and this is how civilization's end. And the globalists that are running our country and the
[24:31.600 --> 24:35.440]  world are crazy. They've been cutting off the resources, they've been dissolving the borders,
[24:35.440 --> 24:38.560]  they've been shipping in the fentanyl, they've been devaluing the currencies,
[24:38.560 --> 24:42.800]  they have been starting all these wars, and they told you, you will soon own nothing
[24:42.800 --> 24:46.240]  and have nothing and be happy. And when I was at the UN last year,
[24:46.960 --> 24:52.240]  they had giant signs up that showed like weird bunkers and people in a concentration camp,
[24:52.240 --> 24:57.520]  and it said, soon you won't live in cities, you'll live in communes, you'll own nothing,
[24:57.520 --> 25:05.600]  you'll have nothing. So the opening salvo was this biochemical genetic engineering weapon
[25:05.600 --> 25:09.200]  that they released from the lab and the vaccine is three times worse on average,
[25:09.200 --> 25:12.960]  so-called vaccine. That was the opening salvo, and we kept saying for two and a half years,
[25:12.960 --> 25:16.880]  what is it they're going to do that's so horrible that all these people are dying,
[25:17.920 --> 25:21.360]  they're distracted by something even bigger, because if you understand the globalist mindset,
[25:21.360 --> 25:24.800]  they hit you with one weapon and they always escalate, so that you're not worried about the
[25:24.800 --> 25:28.800]  last weapon, you're worried about the new attack, which they always, again, pretend somebody else
[25:28.800 --> 25:33.840]  is doing. Well, in this case, it's war with Russia, it's financial collapse, it's depression, okay?
[25:33.840 --> 25:39.600]  So FedEx came out and said, we're going basically into a sustained long-term recession, depression.
[25:40.160 --> 25:45.360]  We see all the numbers coming out, ladies and gentlemen, of the establishment digging in,
[25:45.360 --> 25:50.800]  the elites digging in. I have been in multiple high-level meetings with top people. I told you
[25:50.800 --> 25:55.600]  this six months ago, and again, a few months ago, and I'm not going to name names, these were private
[25:55.600 --> 26:01.360]  meetings, who were asking my advice on where they thought they might need to evacuate to,
[26:01.360 --> 26:06.080]  and some of the evacuation points that were there in the Southern Hemisphere. I can tell you that
[26:08.400 --> 26:14.240]  people like Larry Page and others of Google are living in the South Pacific, and I didn't
[26:14.240 --> 26:19.200]  meet with Page, but I met with people that, let's just say very close to him, other household names,
[26:19.840 --> 26:26.320]  and they're all exiting the country six months ago. Now, that's now in mainstream news. They are
[26:26.320 --> 26:31.840]  running nuclear attack drills on television saying, prepare for nuclear attack and tune into your local
[26:31.840 --> 26:36.160]  radio station or internet. There won't be radio and TV or internet in the sense, okay? The power's
[26:36.160 --> 26:41.200]  going to be off for a long time. It took decades to build all this infrastructure. It'll be blown away
[26:41.200 --> 26:46.400]  in seconds, okay? I'm going to tell you again, I am staying here with the ship, but things are so
[26:46.400 --> 26:50.720]  bad now. If I was asked to again come here in the next few months, I'm not going to. Not because
[26:50.720 --> 26:55.760]  I'm bucking the cord of these people. I got to get ready with my family and to try to, hopefully,
[26:55.760 --> 27:01.120]  we'll survive, okay? So, I'm just, okay, this is it, ladies and gentlemen, and everybody better be
[27:01.120 --> 27:05.840]  praying. Everybody better be on their knees because you're this close to the end of your life as you
[27:05.840 --> 27:11.600]  know it, and it was even a limited nuclear war, a sustained long-term depression. This is a war
[27:11.600 --> 27:15.840]  on humanity by the globalists who want to destroy human civilization, and then on this ashes build
[27:15.840 --> 27:21.120]  a technocracy in their own words. They've told you the future is not human. That's a quote by Harari
[27:21.120 --> 27:26.800]  at the Davos Group. So, I love you. I care about you. I care about the crew. I care about everybody,
[27:26.800 --> 27:33.840]  and I wish this wasn't the case, but ladies and gentlemen, that's why all these top rock stars
[27:33.840 --> 27:39.040]  and country music stars and hip-hop stars and pop stars are canceling all their shows. They've already
[27:39.040 --> 27:44.400]  been told. They're not being told why. It's why over 1,000 CEOs and over 100 top ones designed
[27:44.400 --> 27:51.200]  two months before COVID was released in 2020, in late 2019. The war games have been done. The drills
[27:51.200 --> 27:55.600]  have been prepared, and I'm not trying to scare you. This is a fact, and people just keep expecting
[27:55.600 --> 28:02.400]  civilization to go on forever. But I told my head of security who's been in, and you name it, the
[28:02.400 --> 28:09.920]  military, and all the other groups, and I said, I believe that we got about a 5% chance of nuclear
[28:09.920 --> 28:14.400]  war while we're gone the next week. And I said, I think it's about a 30-40% chance the next month.
[28:14.400 --> 28:19.600]  He said, it's funny you say that. That's exactly what he and his compatriots believe as well.
[28:20.160 --> 28:25.200]  And I know people at the highest levels of Army Special Operations, the highest levels of the CIA,
[28:25.200 --> 28:29.280]  okay, and they all know this, and they all understand this. Okay, so I'm just telling you right now,
[28:29.840 --> 28:36.400]  telling you right now that we better have a mass demonstrations. We better have mass prayer
[28:36.400 --> 28:42.160]  vigils. We better have absolute mass awakening, or all the football and all the crap is about to
[28:42.160 --> 28:48.480]  end, okay? We better come together and say no to war and no to this escalation and demand that Putin
[28:48.480 --> 28:55.040]  and demand that Biden and demand that NATO absolutely stop this escalation now and have
[28:55.040 --> 28:59.200]  a ceasefire armistice. And just like North Korea was divided, give it up.
[28:59.920 --> 29:04.880]  People ask me all the time, what is your best at roping? You've got turbo force,
[29:04.880 --> 29:11.200]  you've got brain force plus, and you've got brain force ultra. Which one is better? And that's like
[29:11.200 --> 29:21.040]  asking, what's better, a Ford F-150 or a Cadillac or a Ferrari? It's different strokes for different
[29:21.040 --> 29:26.640]  folks. It varies. All three are different formulas. All three do different things.
[29:26.640 --> 29:32.560]  Turbo force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy. I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[29:32.560 --> 29:40.000]  Brain force plus is a long term acting clean, new trope. This brain force ultra is a super
[29:40.000 --> 29:46.560]  fast acting, new tropic that creates incredible clarity, but doesn't last very long. They're
[29:46.560 --> 29:52.160]  all three different formulas. And finally, back in stock massively discounted brain force ultra
[29:52.160 --> 29:58.400]  is available at infowarstore.com. Brain force ultra back in stock infowarstore.com.
[29:58.400 --> 30:05.920]  It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year. And I believe the most powerful,
[30:05.920 --> 30:14.560]  the man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt, citizen of a republic, the man in the arena.
[30:14.560 --> 30:20.000]  There's only 10,000 of this coin and it exists in the world. It will never be made again.
[30:20.800 --> 30:26.640]  It's not just an amazing historic coin. It funds the information war against the globalist.
[30:26.640 --> 30:30.800]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren. This is something you want to own.
[30:30.800 --> 30:36.640]  And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war against the globalist.
[30:36.640 --> 30:40.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available. They'll sell out very quickly.

[32:12.880 --> 32:17.600]  catastrophe, looming global catastrophe. The world could run out of food by 2023.
[32:17.600 --> 32:23.280]  Major studies say and the reports go on and on. We told you this was a designed program by the
[32:23.280 --> 32:27.120]  globalist two and a half years ago. We told you energy and food prices would explode and now

[33:32.080 --> 33:36.000]  All right, we're going to be rejoined by Alex Jones any second now. Owen Troyer here in the
[33:36.000 --> 33:43.920]  Info Wars World headquarters in Austin. And you know, it's a difficult
[33:45.760 --> 33:54.480]  issue to do commentary on because obviously I don't want war. Obviously I don't want to see
[33:54.480 --> 34:01.200]  nuclear war, whether it's here in America or in Ukraine or Russia or anywhere else.
[34:02.960 --> 34:07.680]  But at the same time, you got to be a realist and you have to understand that
[34:08.640 --> 34:14.480]  stolen elections have consequences. And we also have to understand that
[34:14.480 --> 34:23.680]  the American political regime and elite have become so corrupt and that corruption is worldwide.
[34:24.720 --> 34:32.320]  And Putin may have decided already in his own mind that he's going to be history's
[34:32.320 --> 34:37.920]  actor and he's going to take out this corruption in the West. Now, I don't want that. I don't want
[34:37.920 --> 34:45.040]  to see war. But I have to be a realist. Stolen elections have consequences. And when you have
[34:45.760 --> 34:53.920]  corrupt, power hungry, mad people like Nazis, they get dealt with. So Alex Jones back with us now
[34:54.480 --> 34:59.200]  on these major issues developing around the world. Alex Jones.
[34:59.200 --> 35:12.480]  All right. I think we're still having a connection issue. So we're going to get that settled and
[35:12.480 --> 35:21.760]  taken care of. And we'll go back. Here's some of the headlines. Putin warns West he isn't bluffing
[35:21.760 --> 35:27.680]  and Russia has lots of weapons as he orders partial mobilization of reserve troops to Ukraine.
[35:27.680 --> 35:34.880]  Putin's upcoming wartime speech could signal major war coming. Putin announces partial
[35:34.880 --> 35:40.640]  mobilization into Ukraine. War escalation says West wants to destroy Russia.
[35:43.040 --> 35:46.480]  Serbian president warns great world conflict within two months.
[35:48.800 --> 35:55.760]  So let me just kind of just give you the full layout here of not just the recent developments,
[35:55.760 --> 35:58.480]  but overall developments that have led us to get here.
[36:01.840 --> 36:08.880]  The Western political empire of the Bushes and the Clintons and the CIA and their economic hitman
[36:09.760 --> 36:16.320]  going back decades really since the 70s have been launching illegitimate wars, proxy wars,
[36:16.320 --> 36:25.440]  and doing regime change all over the world. And at first they could do it pretty easily.
[36:25.440 --> 36:29.840]  They had the economic power. They had the pull and they could get away with some of this stuff.
[36:30.400 --> 36:35.360]  And the internationals that they would do deals with would get paid off handsomely as well.
[36:36.240 --> 36:41.040]  And so at first they didn't mind it. Then they realized that these U.S. power brokers were actually
[36:41.040 --> 36:44.640]  stealing most of their countries, stealing most of their country's wealth and future.
[36:44.640 --> 36:53.440]  And so what did the U.S. do in response basically? They ramped up their game and then they took it
[36:53.440 --> 36:58.240]  to war. And so, oh, okay, well, if we want to do regime change, we'll just do it all out war.
[36:58.240 --> 37:02.560]  We'll just go kill a million Iraqis. All right, we've got Alex Jones back,
[37:02.560 --> 37:06.320]  connection is solid. Alex, just breaking down what's led to this situation now.
[37:06.320 --> 37:15.120]  And it's just, it's just incredible that our media is not covering it accurately.
[37:15.120 --> 37:29.040]  And so the connection is sporadic. I apologize for that. But I am coming in clear now.
[37:29.600 --> 37:39.680]  Yes, I can hear you. All right. I'm not sure if Alex can hear me.
[37:39.680 --> 37:46.080]  So we may have a connection problem yet. Yeah, guys, I'm not sure he's here again.
[37:47.440 --> 37:50.480]  All right, we're gonna have to, we're gonna have to try to reconnect. So picking it back up.
[37:53.200 --> 37:59.840]  So we've seen what America didn't Iraq and Afghanistan and what they tried to do in Syria.
[37:59.840 --> 38:06.960]  And really Syria was kind of the block. Syria was kind of where they couldn't get their regime
[38:06.960 --> 38:11.680]  change. And that was because Syria has strong relations with Russia. And Russia said, you know
[38:11.680 --> 38:17.440]  what, we've had enough of US interventionism in the Middle East. We've seen enough of your blood
[38:18.080 --> 38:23.840]  soaked regime changes. You're not going to do that in Syria. And so the West launched their proxy
[38:23.840 --> 38:28.640]  groups out there to kill people. They launched their false flags with chemical weapons all as
[38:28.640 --> 38:33.680]  an attempt to remove Assad. And it never worked. And that's because Russia stood against them.
[38:33.680 --> 38:42.160]  That's what happened. And so Russia now kind of sees itself Putin kind of sees itself as the only
[38:44.480 --> 38:49.360]  kind of like the tank man almost in a way, the Tiananmen Square tank man of the international
[38:50.000 --> 38:56.880]  world standing against Western proxy wars and regime change wars in the Middle East.
[38:56.880 --> 39:06.160]  And they were successful. Assad is still in power in Syria. And so that's when
[39:07.040 --> 39:13.840]  the West with NATO decided they would up their anti Russian rhetoric and up their anti Russian
[39:13.840 --> 39:25.680]  propaganda and up their anti Russian agenda in Ukraine. And they did that during Obama's years.
[39:25.680 --> 39:32.800]  And then Trump got in and that kind of stopped because anti Russia was not one of Donald Trump's
[39:33.920 --> 39:40.320]  policy issues. And that angered them. So that's why they lied. And they said Trump was
[39:40.320 --> 39:44.560]  colluding with Russia and was a Russian asset. That was obviously all a lie.
[39:44.560 --> 39:56.480]  So here's where it's at now. The leaders of the West are political elite are so insane,
[39:57.680 --> 40:05.360]  so corrupt, so criminal that really no one in the world wants to deal with us except the same
[40:05.360 --> 40:13.360]  European countries that are under the same umbrella of political corruption and the New
[40:13.360 --> 40:19.440]  World Order great reset agenda with the World Economic Forum. But that's not where the world
[40:19.440 --> 40:27.680]  wants to go. And so China saw what Russia was doing and Iran saw what Russia was doing and
[40:27.680 --> 40:33.520]  India saw what Russia was doing. And then other countries have kind of noticed it as well, Japan,
[40:33.520 --> 40:43.600]  Brazil, Mexico. And so the dominoes are starting to fall. And now you have a new international
[40:44.240 --> 40:51.120]  power structure emerging against the West. And that's China and Russia and Iran and India
[40:52.400 --> 40:59.520]  as the main factors. And then other countries that don't want to be globalists and don't want to have
[40:59.520 --> 41:04.720]  corrupt Western influence and World Economic Forum influence and UN influence and globalist
[41:04.720 --> 41:13.120]  influence like Brazil and Mexico and Japan and Turkey and many others. They see this opposition
[41:13.120 --> 41:21.440]  to the Western elite corruption forming and they kind of look at it with curiosity.
[41:23.120 --> 41:28.640]  So your media is not telling you any of this. But the world is moving on from the
[41:28.640 --> 41:34.720]  corrupt political elite of the United States of America, folks. And you're being sold out right now
[41:36.000 --> 41:43.440]  and you're going to be told that it's your duty and it's your job to protect the Western
[41:43.440 --> 41:48.880]  political elite like the Bidens, like the Clintons, like the Bushes, who are all going to tell you
[41:48.880 --> 41:59.600]  we have to go to war with Russia. And so what's scary about this is Putin's commitment knowing
[41:59.600 --> 42:04.400]  that whatever the next move might be, it might happen in the blink of an eye and it might change
[42:04.400 --> 42:10.800]  the entire landscape of the international order overnight. And so that's what Alex is talking
[42:10.800 --> 42:14.960]  about. And if you're not seriously considering this yourself, you don't understand how real
[42:14.960 --> 42:24.640]  the situation is. So it's a real question. Do you want to be in Austin, Texas in this massive
[42:25.360 --> 42:31.360]  population dense area with this huge population density growth? Or do you want to get out to
[42:31.360 --> 42:36.880]  the countryside in case the worst happens? So you don't have to be amongst the zombie hordes.
[42:37.680 --> 42:43.760]  They're going to lose their minds if the power grid goes down. So these are very serious situations
[42:43.760 --> 42:52.160]  and sadly, sadly, the American people are in a compromised position where our leaders
[42:52.160 --> 42:56.080]  are the bad guys and other world leaders are going to try to take them out.
[43:00.960 --> 43:04.960]  Info wars work has never been having a bigger effect than it's having right now.
[43:05.680 --> 43:11.680]  And today is do or die time. If info wars gets the funding into the midterms in the next year,
[43:11.680 --> 43:14.480]  we're going to stay on air and be more effective than ever. But if we don't,
[43:15.440 --> 43:20.960]  I respect your decision and I'm ready to basically implode and shut down our main operations.
[43:20.960 --> 43:25.760]  I've done my work. I've put everything into it. I'm leaving it all in the field.
[43:25.760 --> 43:30.160]  But I believe at a gut level, you're going to come through. Plus you're going to get
[43:30.160 --> 43:35.200]  great products that your family already need. So don't procrastinate show info wars. You want

[44:08.240 --> 44:12.720]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition,
[44:12.720 --> 44:19.040]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store.com. Studies have suggested that fish
[44:19.040 --> 44:25.440]  oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels,
[44:25.440 --> 44:31.440]  decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses
[44:31.440 --> 44:38.720]  in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil
[44:38.720 --> 44:45.200]  can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[44:45.200 --> 44:51.840]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts
[44:51.840 --> 44:57.840]  that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at

[46:56.640 --> 46:59.520]  try taking some before bedtime and see what happens with your dreams.
[47:00.720 --> 47:06.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:06.720 --> 47:20.240]  You know, there is some other big news developing. The Democrats weaponizing the
[47:20.240 --> 47:25.840]  justice system against their opposition. Leticia James in New York now filing new charges against
[47:25.840 --> 47:31.920]  the entire Trump family. You also have an oil refinery on fire in Ohio that killed two people,
[47:31.920 --> 47:36.320]  so the infrastructure continues to be under attack. This is Biden's America. Still no elections have
[47:36.320 --> 47:42.560]  consequences. And so as big as these issues are, and it's a sign of America's devise and collapse
[47:42.560 --> 47:47.920]  under Biden, the issue of nuclear war and World War with Russia is bigger. And that's why Alex
[47:47.920 --> 47:53.520]  Jones is with us now breaking it all down from Connecticut. It appears we have a solid connection
[47:53.520 --> 47:59.680]  with Alex. Now we go live to Alex Jones in Connecticut. And again, I apologize for the
[47:59.680 --> 48:02.640]  problems. I did not mean to be live today. I was supposed to be in court testifying.
[48:03.200 --> 48:07.440]  They changed the day until tomorrow. They did this last week. They did this yesterday.
[48:07.440 --> 48:12.720]  They're doing it again today. And I just feel silly sitting there in a whole court case that's
[48:12.720 --> 48:17.600]  one of the biggest stories in the United States about questioning a mass shooting and like,
[48:17.600 --> 48:26.160]  I'm the ultimate villain on the planet. And meanwhile, Russia just mobilized 300,000 troops
[48:26.160 --> 48:30.640]  is threatening nuclear war. And it's in their doctrine that they're losing on their doorstep
[48:30.640 --> 48:36.160]  to use nuclear weapons. And Putin says, I'm not bluffing. And NATO says they believe they're
[48:36.160 --> 48:40.560]  about to have a nuclear war with Putin. And do people understand that if you think
[48:41.200 --> 48:47.600]  inflation's hurt people, a limited nuclear war will completely take the stock market 90 to 100%.
[48:50.160 --> 48:54.400]  The whole societal breakdown we're seeing is going to accelerate to the 10th power. And
[48:54.400 --> 48:59.200]  again, we have Washington run by globalist criminals that have armed all our enemies like
[48:59.200 --> 49:03.440]  Communist China that are saying the number one threat in the world is American conservatives.
[49:03.440 --> 49:08.240]  And now on the national news, NBC News in places, when they have prayer visuals and
[49:08.240 --> 49:12.400]  Christians put their hands up, it was, what should you reach out to God? I mean, you can
[49:12.400 --> 49:17.200]  tell people to air reach out to God. It's that act of free will. They're not calling that a Nazi
[49:17.200 --> 49:23.120]  salute. I mean, this is just the mass insanity of establishment. There are minions are like this.
[49:23.120 --> 49:28.720]  And remember all the fires a few years ago out in California, they caught a bunch of
[49:28.720 --> 49:32.960]  antifa and leftists starting those fires to quote, bring down human civilization.
[49:32.960 --> 49:36.960]  So the leftists are blocking railway stations are blocking highways with the extinction
[49:36.960 --> 49:42.240]  rebellion and burning things down around the world on the bottom. And at the top,
[49:42.240 --> 49:46.640]  the globalists are cutting off the energy dissolving the borders, having global lockdowns
[49:46.640 --> 49:51.360]  to destroy the industrial civilization. And they say they're doing this on purpose.
[49:51.360 --> 49:57.760]  It's not even my opinion that they're doing this while they're injecting us with deadly mRNA shots
[49:57.760 --> 50:01.360]  that erase our immune systems and cause cancer and heart attacks. I mean,
[50:02.800 --> 50:07.920]  this is their war. And the globalists have an exit strategy to collapse the world economy,
[50:07.920 --> 50:12.880]  collapse the world system. And then cloud swab and the other globalists believe,
[50:13.520 --> 50:17.040]  because they'll control the military that they will emerge from their bunkers,
[50:17.040 --> 50:22.320]  emerge from their redoubts after there's been this huge cataclysmic war and all this.
[50:22.320 --> 50:25.920]  And then AI machines will rise and they're going to have this great technocracy.
[50:25.920 --> 50:32.880]  These people are crazy. The Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the cloud swab, the Bill Gates's
[50:32.880 --> 50:36.720]  of the world, everybody knows they're the ones behind them. I say everybody. I mean,
[50:36.720 --> 50:40.800]  half the public in the world, they're having giant million person rallies,
[50:40.800 --> 50:44.720]  five million person rallies in Brazil, million person rallies in Germany and Italy,
[50:44.720 --> 50:49.680]  million person rallies, 500,000 person rallies in the UK, all about the new world order,
[50:49.680 --> 50:53.760]  all about cloud swab, all about the great reset, all about the new world order.
[50:53.760 --> 50:58.160]  My book about the great reset is number one in the world. Thanks to viewers and listeners,
[50:58.160 --> 51:02.720]  people understood the topic. And the point is, it is that people know they're doing it.
[51:02.720 --> 51:07.680]  They plan to carry this out and have people not know. We know. So my message to cloud
[51:07.680 --> 51:14.880]  swab and his controllers and the Rothschilds and your crazy puppet, Biden is stop now you crazy
[51:14.880 --> 51:19.200]  maniacs. They're running the blue cities in the ground. They're running leftist control
[51:19.200 --> 51:24.720]  companies in the ground. And now in military doctrine, this is the standard setting.
[51:25.360 --> 51:29.280]  If the Russians start getting their ass kicked on their border, they use nuclear weapons. Let me
[51:29.280 --> 51:33.200]  say it again. If the Russians start losing on their border, they use nuclear weapons. Let me
[51:33.200 --> 51:38.560]  say it again. If the Russians are getting their ass kicked, take the Russians ass. Yeah, the U.S.
[51:38.560 --> 51:43.040]  is in there with high tech weapons and switchblade drones and niling the Russians. The Russians
[51:43.040 --> 51:48.880]  then use nuclear weapons. The Russians use nuclear weapons. The Russians use nuclear weapons.
[51:48.880 --> 51:54.960]  The Russians use nuclear weapons. And you notice in this war, they go, oh my gosh, this big biggest
[51:54.960 --> 51:59.280]  nuclear power plant in Europe might melt down and blow up. It's already been hit a few times.
[51:59.280 --> 52:04.320]  What do you think happens when the electricity goes off in surrounding areas? Those plants operate
[52:04.320 --> 52:09.280]  off of outside electricity. You think they operate on their own, they don't. And so within two weeks
[52:10.160 --> 52:14.240]  of major power outages, you know what nuclear reactors do? They melt down. They're not like a
[52:14.240 --> 52:19.040]  hydrogen bomb that makes it 2,000 feet, does a big air burst and just blast everything to pieces
[52:19.040 --> 52:24.800]  and has limited fallout only lasts about a month. When a nuclear reactor, depending on the type,
[52:24.800 --> 52:30.960]  it runs from bad to worse, melts down. It starts spewing and exploding and burning and ejecting
[52:30.960 --> 52:36.640]  deadly radioactive isotopes out because it's called a dirty bomb. The biggest dirty bombs in the
[52:36.640 --> 52:42.160]  world are nuclear reactors when they melt down. Think Fukushima, think Chernobyl, think Three
[52:42.160 --> 52:48.320]  Mile Island that just had a leak and killed a bunch of people. So we have 460 plus nuclear
[52:48.320 --> 52:52.640]  reactors worldwide that are energy reactors. There are several hundred nuclear submarines in the
[52:52.640 --> 52:57.200]  world that have reactors. A bunch of aircraft carriers and a bunch of secret nuclear reactors.
[52:57.200 --> 53:01.920]  Let me let you know that. Oh yeah, there's a bunch of secret nuclear reactors, small ones.
[53:01.920 --> 53:10.400]  And if they don't get taken care of, they blow up. They blow up. So you can't have a nuclear war.
[53:10.400 --> 53:16.000]  We need to be praying. We need to get past left and right. We need to have people in mass vigils.
[53:16.000 --> 53:23.120]  You start with one woman with a candle at the Austin Capitol or the DC Capitol. This is not
[53:23.120 --> 53:28.800]  about politics. It's about peace and stopping this out of control war. Where is the old liberals
[53:28.800 --> 53:32.960]  that were against war? Now they're total fascists at what war? And then where's the right wing?
[53:32.960 --> 53:40.560]  Ted Cruz wanting all this war. This is completely insane. So we're distracting with transgenderism
[53:40.560 --> 53:47.040]  and Alex Jones and Sandy Hook and all this stupid garbage. The world is hurtling towards
[53:47.040 --> 53:52.880]  absolute war. And Putin is issuing ultimatums and he's saying he's already cutting the energy off to
[53:52.880 --> 53:56.800]  Europe. So the inflation has already been bad enough. Now it's going to be devastating. Europe's
[53:56.800 --> 54:01.840]  paying 900% more for gas. They're paying about three times more for electricity. And this winter
[54:01.840 --> 54:10.160]  it's set to quadruple that. Total economic collapse, annihilation of society as we know it by design
[54:10.160 --> 54:15.920]  has been engineered, has been prepared. And this is the facts. You're getting tomorrow's news today.
[54:15.920 --> 54:20.640]  So I'm going to explain something to you. I never take my wife and my five-year-old because my other
[54:20.640 --> 54:24.720]  children are teenagers. They're grown up. They're back at Austin. Love them just as much, but they're
[54:24.720 --> 54:30.080]  big. I never take it with me on these trips. These things we have to go be summoned by these
[54:30.080 --> 54:35.040]  globalist courts. They're with me now. My daughter's right out there running around in the backyard of
[54:35.040 --> 54:40.000]  this Airbnb playing on the grass and chasing butterflies right now. And I hear her giggling
[54:40.000 --> 54:45.280]  and laughing out there. And it enrages me that the new world order has put us in this position.
[54:45.280 --> 54:51.280]  It is fucking bullshit. And just like Planet of the Apes ends, when Charlton has said,
[54:51.280 --> 54:55.760]  finds back, he's back on Earth, because he finds a melted statue of liberty. And he says, damn you
[54:55.760 --> 55:04.640]  to hell, you murdered us. You blew it all up. You bastards. We are up to that point. We are two minutes
[55:04.640 --> 55:08.880]  to midnight right now. And this is BS. And they're running nuclear attack drills in
[55:08.880 --> 55:13.920]  Denver. Nuclear attack drills in New York. Nuclear attack drills in Miami. They're telling
[55:13.920 --> 55:18.160]  the police get ready for nuclear war. They've got bug out packs. The underground bunkers all
[55:18.160 --> 55:23.920]  prepared. And as I told you earlier before my video cut out, I have had multiple meetings in
[55:23.920 --> 55:29.840]  the last year with top globalist, Bilderberg group members. I went and met one on the West Coast.
[55:30.400 --> 55:35.600]  And I met one secretly in Austin about two months ago. And they all sat there and they all told me
[55:35.600 --> 55:41.280]  the exact same thing. They said, yes, we thought you were wrong. It looks like it's out of control
[55:41.280 --> 55:45.680]  that there's people on top of us that are totally insane. What do you think is going to happen?
[55:46.400 --> 55:50.640]  So I'm going to explain to you, ladies and gentlemen, I have had multi-millionaires,
[55:50.640 --> 55:55.840]  well-known household names, asked me, are you planning to evacuate for the Southern Hemisphere?
[55:56.400 --> 56:00.000]  And I said, I don't have the money. And I believe it's going to be so bad even the Southern
[56:00.000 --> 56:03.840]  Hemisphere is going to be annihilated. I'm going to go down with the ship. But that's why I take
[56:03.840 --> 56:08.720]  this so serious, because this is real, people. This is absolutely real, just like everything else
[56:08.720 --> 56:12.640]  you see. You don't believe we're in the lockdowns, it happened. You don't believe they didn't get
[56:12.640 --> 56:16.400]  rid of the borders, it happened. You didn't believe they double the price of things, it happened.
[56:16.400 --> 56:20.080]  And it's getting ready to get worse and worse and worse because we have psychotic criminals in
[56:20.080 --> 56:24.240]  control who are run by a dark evil force that want the collapse of civilization,
[56:24.240 --> 56:30.080]  agenda 2030, the post-industrial world, the build back better on our ashes. That's why
[56:30.080 --> 56:34.000]  info wars, that's the state on the air, as long as we can, every day is a blessing. That's why
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.920]  you're spreading the word, you sharing these articles, these videos, this live feed later
[56:37.920 --> 56:44.560]  will be posted to Bandai Video, this emergency nuclear war imminent threat. That's the reality here
[56:44.560 --> 56:48.800]  and that's the issue that's going on. Civilizations come and go. So many civilizations
[56:48.800 --> 56:52.960]  have committed suicide, but they didn't have nuclear weapons. They didn't have chemical weapons.
[56:52.960 --> 56:58.160]  They didn't have, it's way worse than that. All sorts of physics weapons, all sorts of fission,
[56:58.160 --> 57:04.720]  confusion and in any manner, cyclotron, projectors and just everything else, it's horrible.
[57:05.840 --> 57:10.640]  So I'm going to tell you again, ladies and gentlemen, the world is on the verge of a
[57:10.640 --> 57:15.440]  civilization ending event. I want to assure you to continue on doing a great job,
[57:15.440 --> 57:18.960]  please pray for him, please pray for him for worse. Yes, we're being targeted because we're
[57:18.960 --> 57:24.400]  trying to speak sanity to this satanic evil. But remember, the only answer is God and prayer
[57:24.400 --> 57:28.880]  and getting right with God and then God working through using the Holy Spirit to have the strength,
[57:28.880 --> 57:34.960]  the will, the focus to be lead, guided and directed by God to do what is needed. God,
[57:34.960 --> 57:41.360]  please lead God and direct us. Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today. Thank you for your support.

[58:51.840 --> 58:58.240]  represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic. I wouldn't be surprised
[58:58.240 --> 59:04.800]  if this doesn't have an operational name. In fact, I bet it does. I bet it's called Operation
[59:04.800 --> 59:12.400]  Matador. They see us as the bull and they are shaky, a red flag in our face and the Matador is
[59:12.400 --> 59:18.800]  the deep state with a long skinny razor sharp sword so that when the bull lunges forward,
[59:18.800 --> 59:24.480]  the Matador uses the force of its weight to drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape
[59:24.480 --> 59:29.280]  as the bull buries himself into the dust. They've got the ace of spades in their hand,
[59:29.280 --> 59:34.400]  which is false flags. Before you launch a war, you stage false flags. That's the first thing you
[59:34.400 --> 59:39.920]  do because nobody wants to say they started a war. Bad guys start wars. So every time a war gets
[59:39.920 --> 59:45.040]  launched by bad guys, they stage an event. This is Operation Matador.
[59:45.040 --> 59:56.880]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:15.120 --> 1:00:26.880]  The United States and Russia who had to team up to defeat Adolf Hitler.
[1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:35.840]  When a power mad corrupt leader emerges with blood in his eyes,
[1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:43.520]  other world leaders have to step up, take him out. This happens throughout human history.
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:50.960]  And the sad truth of it is, the most corrupt political leaders and government leaders
[1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:59.920]  on this earth are in the United States of America. And you have Biden now saying,
[1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:06.800]  we don't want a cold war with China. We don't want a conflict with China
[1:01:08.320 --> 1:01:15.440]  in a speech he gave today. And you just have to wonder, are our political leaders really that
[1:01:15.440 --> 1:01:20.720]  out of touch? Are they really that lost in their own sauce?
[1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:29.280]  Joe Biden illegally launched a war against Russia three months ago.
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:42.640]  And China knows it. Iran knows it. India knows it. Mexico knows it. Turkey knows it.
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:49.600]  North African countries know it. Really, everyone knows it. The media just won't tell you it.
[1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:56.480]  And so what they do is, they disguise it as a humanitarian issue. And they say, oh, look,
[1:01:56.480 --> 1:02:00.880]  the poor Ukrainians, we have to go in there. It's a humanitarian issue. Really? Well,
[1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:04.880]  what about Yemen? Is that a humanitarian issue? Well, no, that doesn't count. They don't have
[1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:13.600]  an agenda there. So it's the U.S. fighting Russia in Ukraine. That's what's going on.
[1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:21.840]  And Russia wanted to demilitarize eastern Ukraine, take out the proxy groups in eastern Ukraine,
[1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:27.840]  which many of them were Nazi battalions, Azov Nazi battalions. They don't hide it. They run
[1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:32.320]  around in their Nazi garb. They had the Nazi tattoos all over them. They brought one of
[1:02:32.320 --> 1:02:39.280]  the Nazis to the U.S. for like some video game conference, and they made him put an arm sleeve
[1:02:39.280 --> 1:02:46.480]  over his his arm because it had Nazi tattoos on it. So they know. We've played the videos.
[1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:53.040]  It's American special operators on the front lines of Ukraine, driving Russia back. And
[1:02:53.040 --> 1:02:57.680]  so now Putin is just sitting here trying to tell you, but whether you think Putin is
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:04.800]  good or bad is relevant. Putin is just sitting here trying to tell you, hey, we're running
[1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:13.120]  operations in Ukraine. And the U.S. is starting a war against us. And we're going to be forced
[1:03:13.120 --> 1:03:22.320]  to respond if it doesn't stop. And our media is so corrupt and so inept that not only are
[1:03:22.320 --> 1:03:27.920]  they not telling you that that's what's going on, they're actually backing the warmonger
[1:03:27.920 --> 1:03:34.800]  Biden and the warmonger military industrial complex out of the West that they used to
[1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:39.440]  fight against, that they used to stand against and call out. Now they're fully behind it
[1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:47.280]  as they're fully indoctrinated into the propaganda and brainwashing that has caused them to completely
[1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:55.040]  lose their minds in this new liberal insanity Democrat progressivism.
[1:03:55.040 --> 1:04:06.160]  So I don't know how this goes, but I will tell you this. At the end of the day, folks,
[1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:12.240]  Vladimir Putin is not your problem. Okay. He is nowhere near your problem. Xi Jinping
[1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:16.680]  is a bigger problem for you than Vladimir Putin. But even Xi Jinping is not a problem
[1:04:16.680 --> 1:04:24.080]  in comparison to Joe Biden and whoever is running him and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab
[1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:28.880]  and whoever else has signed on to the great reset World Economic Forum build back better
[1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:35.720]  plan that is going to crush your life, crush your way of life, crush your freedom, crush
[1:04:35.720 --> 1:04:41.080]  your prosperity and steal your future. And they want you to believe that Vladimir Putin
[1:04:41.080 --> 1:04:46.600]  is your big enemy because if they launch a war against him, they want you to back them
[1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:54.400]  as they completely steal your future and steal your birthright of a free American citizen.
[1:05:29.880 --> 1:05:33.160]  energy. I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[1:05:33.160 --> 1:05:50.440]  The brain force plus is a long term acting clean. This brain force ultra is a super fast

[1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:23.520]  your host, Owen Troyer, you don't have any burning inside of you right now to get the
[1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:32.560]  hell away as far as possible away from Democrat Party extremism. I just don't know if if
[1:06:32.560 --> 1:06:38.920]  you're if you're truly alive, we might have to check your pulse. Obviously, we've covered
[1:06:38.920 --> 1:06:44.560]  what the Biden administration has done to the to the world as now we're on the brink
[1:06:44.560 --> 1:06:49.400]  of a world war situation with Russia, Biden illegitimately illegal start illegally starting
[1:06:49.400 --> 1:06:56.360]  a war with Russia about two months ago. Now it's really starting to come to a head. But
[1:06:56.360 --> 1:07:03.160]  really that's just Western extremism, the military industrial complex that Dwight Eisenhower
[1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:06.680]  warned us about that liberals used to stand against now there for it because it's Joe
[1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:14.920]  Biden. But you also have the Democrat Party extremism happening at a very local personal
[1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:23.040]  domestic level with all the violent Democrat crimes. Trump supporters being shot and killed
[1:07:23.040 --> 1:07:26.720]  in Portland, Trump supporters being shot and killed in Denver, Trump supporters getting
[1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:33.080]  shot and killed in DC like Ashley Babbitt. And you just had a situation in North Carol
[1:07:33.080 --> 1:07:40.920]  or excuse me, North Dakota, where an individual 41 year old adult male got into a political
[1:07:40.920 --> 1:07:45.460]  conflict debate against a young conservative man 18 years old and decided he would kill
[1:07:45.460 --> 1:07:51.320]  him by running him over with his vehicle. That's Democrat Party extremism. Guess what
[1:07:51.320 --> 1:07:56.040]  wasn't covered at all on the news last night. Now I do expect it to be covered on Fox News
[1:07:56.040 --> 1:07:59.840]  tonight. They're usually at least 24 hours behind the cycle because their new shows
[1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:05.040]  are prepared by noon every day before they go on, you know, hours later. So very rarely
[1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:09.600]  are prime time cable news actually up to date on these issues. My guess is they'll probably
[1:08:09.600 --> 1:08:18.240]  cover it tonight at least on Tucker. But no mention of Kaler Ellington last night in any
[1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:24.640]  news killed by Shannon Brant who admitted in his statement that he did it for political
[1:08:24.640 --> 1:08:30.160]  reasons. This is Democrat Party extremism, folks. The Democrat Party is the largest
[1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:34.680]  terror group in the United States of America, and it always has been citizens and since
[1:08:34.680 --> 1:08:41.960]  it's beginnings out of the KKK. Nothing has changed. It went from the KKK to the weather
[1:08:41.960 --> 1:08:48.360]  underground to where we're at now. Democrats killing teenagers in the streets. And of course,
[1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:55.200]  the liberal Democrats are lying and they say there's no evidence it was political. Really?
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:09:00.200]  Because we have the statement from the man that drove the car and he said it himself
[1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:04.280]  that he did it for political reasons. But he said he was an extremist. He said he was
[1:09:04.280 --> 1:09:08.440]  an extremist Republican. So he was doing what the Democrats told him to do. You see an
[1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:20.440]  extremist Republican, you go kill him. Democrat Party extremism. Now, here's the, here's
[1:09:20.440 --> 1:09:31.240]  the rub right now. If you're an accelerationist, which sometimes I'll admit that I feel a little
[1:09:31.240 --> 1:09:34.560]  bit of the accelerationist mentality, then you want stuff like this. Now, I don't want
[1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:41.520]  anybody to die, obviously. So let me further explain. When I see the New York Attorney
[1:09:41.520 --> 1:09:48.840]  General Leticia James as corrupt as the day is long, now filing all new charges against
[1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:55.600]  every member of the Trump family, obviously that's bad for the country. That's weaponizing
[1:09:55.600 --> 1:09:58.640]  the law enforcement, the justice department against your political opposition. That's
[1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:03.600]  obviously bad for the country. But if you recognize how bad things are and you become
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:09.680]  an accelerationist, you kind of say, you know what? Good. Good Democrats. Keep going after
[1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:12.760]  DeSantis for what you've been doing all around the country for the last two years with the
[1:10:12.760 --> 1:10:17.440]  illegal immigrants. Keep going after Donald Trump illegitimately because you fear him
[1:10:17.440 --> 1:10:24.280]  politically. Now, sad to say this, I don't, I don't genuinely mean this. It's just trying
[1:10:24.280 --> 1:10:28.600]  to make a point. Keep killing Trump supporters in the street. Keep shooting the Ashley Babbits.
[1:10:28.600 --> 1:10:34.640]  Keep running over conservatives with your vehicles. Keep showing the world who you are
[1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:43.240]  at the hopes that maybe finally enough people in this country in leadership roles and position
[1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:48.060]  of power will finally step up, stand up, say and do the right thing to stop this Democrat
[1:10:48.060 --> 1:10:52.720]  party terrorism from completely destroying our country ahead of Joe Biden, completely
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:11:00.720]  destroying the United States of America. But you know what? I sit here and I see all of
[1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:08.560]  that and I think it all out and I realize it's not going to make a damn difference.
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:14.120]  If Donald Trump, if when Donald Trump was in the White House for four years and we couldn't
[1:11:14.120 --> 1:11:18.560]  do anything about these extremists and these terrorists and these liars and these crooks
[1:11:18.560 --> 1:11:23.760]  and criminals, how the hell are we going to do anything now? How the hell do we have a
[1:11:23.760 --> 1:11:31.160]  chance to do anything now? And it's quite upsetting. It's quite upsetting now to be seeing
[1:11:31.160 --> 1:11:38.000]  the rest of America waking up and catching up to infowars as far as the understanding
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:42.680]  of how corrupt our politicians are, how corrupt the Democrat party is, what the New World
[1:11:42.680 --> 1:11:52.280]  Order is, what the Great Reset is, what Build Back Better is. I think it's too late. Sadly,
[1:11:52.280 --> 1:12:01.600]  I just think it's too late because we've crossed the line now where I just don't know what
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:07.440]  else you do. What else do you do about Democrats with hundreds of political prisoners? What
[1:12:07.440 --> 1:12:11.800]  else do you do about Democrats murdering Trump supporters and by the way, the guy that ran
[1:12:11.800 --> 1:12:16.560]  over the young man because he was a conservative, he's released from jail. So what do you do?
[1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:20.240]  Democrats murder you for your political beliefs. They get released from jail the next day.
[1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:25.480]  What do you do? The Democrat run cities completely overrun with violent crime. What do you do?
[1:12:25.480 --> 1:12:29.320]  Joe Biden illegally starting a war with Russia and Ukraine and now the whole world might
[1:12:29.320 --> 1:12:37.320]  have to pay the price with a nuclear war. What do you do now? It's over. They stole the presidency.
[1:12:37.320 --> 1:12:43.440]  The Supreme Court is gutless. The Republican Party is gutless. The American media is just
[1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:51.600]  as corrupt as the Democrats. And so you feel like you just got to get the hell out of dodge.
[1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:54.840]  You feel like you just got to find yourself a place in the country and just hope you can
[1:12:54.840 --> 1:13:00.880]  somehow be isolated from all of this collapse coming down around us. Because quite frankly,
[1:13:00.880 --> 1:13:07.480]  I don't see any leadership saving us folks. And you know, info wars has always been the
[1:13:07.480 --> 1:13:12.480]  leadership, the voice of truth, the leading edge, the tip of the spear in media. And as
[1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:19.400]  you can see, they're trying to cut that tip off. They're trying to destroy that. They're
[1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:27.920]  trying to get this thing off of there. Just like they got Trump out of office. So what
[1:13:27.920 --> 1:13:40.720]  do we do? What do we do? I don't know what the solution is. Certainly pray. Certainly
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:44.560]  the gut instinct to just get the hell out of Democrat run cities, get the hell out of
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:48.120]  population dense areas. Hell, at this point, you might just want to get the hell out of
[1:13:48.120 --> 1:14:00.800]  this country. That's how bad things are getting. But it's hilarious. Joe Biden today showing
[1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:08.120]  how ignorant he is on international affairs saying, Hey, we don't want to war with China.
[1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:12.840]  Hey Joe, in case you haven't noticed, you started a war with Russia and China's on Russia's
[1:14:12.840 --> 1:14:20.440]  side. I guess you missed that one, Joe. I guess your staff didn't tell you about that
[1:14:20.440 --> 1:14:27.500]  one. Did they, Joe? How China and India and Iran are forming a new international power
[1:14:27.500 --> 1:14:34.080]  structure against you and the globalists. I guess you guys missed that one, didn't you?
[1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:39.480]  I guess in your hubris, you missed out on everything going out around you, didn't you?
[1:14:39.480 --> 1:14:45.960]  In your hubris, in your dominance, in your lust to conquer humanity and destroy a free
[1:14:45.960 --> 1:14:49.960]  and prosperous nation in the United States of America, I guess you missed, I guess you
[1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:56.440]  missed that fastball that whizzed right past you, didn't you? Just you missed it, didn't
[1:14:56.440 --> 1:15:03.920]  you? Russia, China, Iran, India, new international power structure against the Crop West. Brazil,
[1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:09.520]  Mexico, Turkey, others, Japan, looking at it saying, Hmm, this ain't so bad. I guess
[1:15:09.520 --> 1:15:16.000]  you missed that one, didn't you, Joe? I guess you missed that one. I guess you missed that
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:22.480]  one when you gave Russia control of Nord Stream 2 and they cut off energy to Europe and Germany,
[1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:26.920]  like Trump said they would. I guess you missed that one too, Joe, didn't you? Of course,
[1:15:26.920 --> 1:15:31.720]  Joe doesn't care. He's got his millions. He's got his mansions. He's got Air Force One.
[1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:37.160]  He's got the whole media on his side. He lives in La La Land, just like all you other liberal
[1:15:37.160 --> 1:15:43.720]  Democrat moron a-holes. Oh, it's just disgusting that this is what we've done with our life,
[1:15:43.720 --> 1:15:48.640]  our consciousness, our potential experience on this planet. We're just throwing it all
[1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:53.920]  the way, letting us get conquered by a bunch of demonic rulers and then lying us into World
[1:15:53.920 --> 1:16:03.200]  War III. The best-selling book in America last week was The Great Reset and The War
[1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:10.160]  for the Worlds, written by Alex Jones. Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last
[1:16:10.160 --> 1:16:12.880]  week, but the New York Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you
[1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:17.040]  to know that. The New York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:21.640]  than the New York Times. The paper that started the Iraq War by lying about weapons of mass
[1:16:21.640 --> 1:16:26.400]  destruction and got a million people killed, so they lied about his book. The Great Reset
[1:16:26.400 --> 1:16:32.080]  and The War for the World, the historic book that lays out the plans of The Great Reset
[1:16:32.080 --> 1:16:39.720]  Death Star and exposes the New World Order's plans for global enslavement. Get your copy

[1:16:54.040 --> 1:16:58.000]  in the world.
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:04.040]  It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year, and I believe the most powerful,
[1:17:04.040 --> 1:17:11.640]  the man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt. The citizen of a republic, the man in the
[1:17:11.640 --> 1:17:17.360]  arena. There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence in the world. It will never be
[1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:23.720]  made again. It's not just an amazing historic coin. It funds the information war against
[1:17:23.720 --> 1:17:27.440]  the globalist. This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren. This is
[1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:33.440]  something you want to own. And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war against
[1:17:33.440 --> 1:17:37.680]  the globalist. Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available. They'll sell out very
[1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:44.760]  quickly. Please be part of history and thank you all for your support. You can go to 1776coin.com

[1:17:58.680 --> 1:18:03.440]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular
[1:18:03.440 --> 1:18:09.080]  system, for your brain, for every part of your body. But what I don't see being promoted
[1:18:09.080 --> 1:18:16.880]  is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects. It certainly does for me. When I
[1:18:16.880 --> 1:18:22.800]  take a couple of these capsules from an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing.
[1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:28.680]  Now there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain,
[1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:33.440]  but I want you to experience it for yourself. We know it's good for your heart. We know
[1:18:33.440 --> 1:18:36.880]  it's good for your brain. We know it's good for your arteries and veins and your lungs
[1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:41.360]  and every other function of your body. But I want you to experience this high grade fish
[1:18:41.360 --> 1:18:46.680]  oil, this ultimate fish oil at infowarstore.com and see what it does if you take it before
[1:18:46.680 --> 1:18:53.720]  bedtime. Ultimate fish oil, 50% off, now exclusively available at infowarstore.com. Thank you all
[1:18:53.720 --> 1:18:58.040]  for your support. You're really going to miss out if you don't get it.
[1:18:58.040 --> 1:19:02.600]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher,
[1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:07.800]  a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire. Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[1:19:07.800 --> 1:19:12.600]  You see it every year. 30 different tax returns, 30 different answers. 50 different tax returns,
[1:19:12.600 --> 1:19:17.920]  50 different answers. And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms
[1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:21.800]  and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general
[1:19:21.800 --> 1:19:27.040]  public understanding this and knowing this. So it's a very important situation with inflation,
[1:19:27.040 --> 1:19:33.200]  and all the things out there hurting everybody. To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal
[1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:36.920]  and lawful that allows you to keep more your money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't
[1:19:36.920 --> 1:19:43.480]  gotten great tax advice in the last few years. The only way you fail is not writing down
[1:19:43.480 --> 1:19:59.320]  the URL, jonestaxrelief.com. One word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-904-285. 833-904-285.
[1:19:59.320 --> 1:20:17.240]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:17.240 --> 1:20:29.920]  Let's keep in mind Joe Biden just said the U.S. would protect Taiwan with troops. The
[1:20:29.920 --> 1:20:34.320]  White House then contradicted that statement and said it's not true. So Biden illegally
[1:20:34.320 --> 1:20:38.760]  launches a war against Russia and Ukraine, then Biden says we'll have to draft U.S. people
[1:20:38.760 --> 1:20:46.600]  into fighting for Taiwan against China as well. Just amazing stuff. And then this, this
[1:20:46.600 --> 1:20:51.920]  is a nice one. It's a nice howdy-do for you. Human composting is now legal in California,
[1:20:51.920 --> 1:21:01.240]  leading the way to Soylent Green. Why not? Only in California, am I right? Only in Democrat
[1:21:01.240 --> 1:21:10.440]  run California. But I want to move on from this stuff. It's a little heavy, obviously,
[1:21:10.440 --> 1:21:15.880]  in a way you down, but there's a lot of other news. It's just such an important issue and
[1:21:15.880 --> 1:21:20.760]  the media is not going to be honest about it. And just any night now, the things could
[1:21:20.760 --> 1:21:29.240]  escalate and get even worse. And it's really just such a shame. And it's so heavy, it's
[1:21:29.240 --> 1:21:34.160]  hard to just lift it up and toss it off and move on. But that's what I'm going to have
[1:21:34.160 --> 1:21:40.480]  to do here. Now, ladies and gentlemen, remember InfowarsStore.com is what makes everything
[1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:48.120]  that we do here possible. That's your support at InfowarsStore.com. And we have a immunity

[1:22:21.640 --> 1:22:27.800]  vitamin D3 gummies. I recommend the vitamin D3 gummies. I think they're great for children.
[1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:32.720]  Just have those two of them sitting out on the counter every morning for your children.
[1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:37.760]  And you know they'll get their daily dose of vitamin D. And they won't be vitamin D
[1:22:37.760 --> 1:22:44.560]  deficient, and they'll have a nice, strong immune system. So I suggest the immunity supercharger
[1:22:44.560 --> 1:22:49.840]  pack with all three of them combined 50% off. But you can get the vitamin D3 gummies for

[1:23:14.680 --> 1:23:25.240]  now, historically speaking. Okay, boy oh boy, where do we go from here?
[1:23:25.240 --> 1:23:37.360]  Let's do some of the open border news. And you know what though? I'm probably going to
[1:23:37.360 --> 1:23:44.640]  take a couple segments. It's just amazing, isn't it? How Democrats and Liberals can
[1:23:44.640 --> 1:23:52.000]  just lie to your face and just be the most openly obvious hypocrites ever. It's just
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:59.600]  amazing stuff, isn't it? Record numbers of illegal immigrants under Joe Biden. Record
[1:23:59.600 --> 1:24:03.360]  numbers. I mean just groundbreaking record numbers, like just blowing the competition
[1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:10.800]  away. Not to mention more terrorists have been arrested trying to cross the southern
[1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:19.440]  border than every other year in this country's history combined. Think about that. Under
[1:24:19.440 --> 1:24:26.680]  Joe Biden, in less than two years, under Joe Biden, more individuals on the FBI terror
[1:24:26.680 --> 1:24:31.240]  watch list, the international terror watch list, have been apprehended at the southern
[1:24:31.240 --> 1:24:42.680]  border than every other year in this nation's history combined. Combined. And then you've
[1:24:42.680 --> 1:24:47.280]  got the middle of the night flights all over the country. You've got the bus loads. You've
[1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:53.760]  got the cabs. You've got the trains all paid for US tax about dollars. All well documented
[1:24:53.760 --> 1:25:00.440]  by ourselves and others. And then the Democrats and the mainstream media are going to take
[1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:14.040]  that issue and they're going to blame Republicans. They're going to blame DeSantis. MSNBC. DeSantis
[1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:21.400]  attempted to catch liberals in a lie. The GOP refuses to accept that his plan flopped.
[1:25:21.400 --> 1:25:27.640]  What much of the GOP doesn't get about the Martha's Vineyard story? No. DeSantis did
[1:25:27.640 --> 1:25:33.080]  catch you in a lie. You said you wanted illegal immigrants. You said you were a sanctuary
[1:25:33.080 --> 1:25:40.040]  city specifically in Martha's Vineyard. And so illegal immigrants went to your sanctuary
[1:25:40.040 --> 1:25:46.520]  city of Martha's Vineyard and you kicked them out. You are the very definition of a liar.
[1:25:46.520 --> 1:25:53.700]  In fact, a liberal is now above a liar. I think liberal is a worse. Being a liberal is inherently
[1:25:53.700 --> 1:26:05.320]  being a liar, but it's worse because you use lies to conquer and destroy other people. But
[1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:09.400]  they're in total denial that they got caught in their lie. They're in total denial that
[1:26:09.400 --> 1:26:13.000]  they've been fully exposed on this issue. They're just completely in denial about it.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:17.240]  But they know the Democrats at the top know that they can lie to you all day long and
[1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:24.640]  the media is going to cover for them. They know they can get away with that. And so they
[1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:30.280]  continue. Now, who's down there reporting at the border? Probably more so and better
[1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:39.100]  than anyone else. That's Bill Melligen. And now the White House is trying to get Bill
[1:26:39.100 --> 1:26:45.040]  Melligen shut down and banned and censored from the Internet. A complete violation of
[1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:51.040]  the First Amendment right. This has now been confirmed by whistleblowers in big tech companies
[1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:56.800]  and just Mark Zuckerberg and others just admitting it on television that the government, the
[1:26:56.800 --> 1:27:00.760]  White House, the FBI goes to them and tells them to censor Trump supporters and censor
[1:27:00.760 --> 1:27:05.800]  conservatives. It's all in the record. Now they're trying to do it to Bill Melligen.
[1:27:05.800 --> 1:27:11.480]  Bill Melligen says, Politico reports that the White House has become irritated with
[1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:15.800]  me and our Fox News teams reporting at the border. And so here's how they do this, folks,
[1:27:15.800 --> 1:27:19.600]  because I've already, I've already, I mean, you know, we were the first wave to be hit
[1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:27.760]  by these people, these censorship fascists. What they do is they identify an individual.
[1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:32.240]  The government reaches out to big tech and says this individual needs censored, but they
[1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:37.880]  kind of have to cover their tracks. So then the Democrats reach out to their friends in
[1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:44.520]  the media, usually Politico or Media Matters or the Daily Beast, and then they'll write
[1:27:44.520 --> 1:27:50.000]  a hit piece about the individual that they want to see get censored. And then the next
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:55.960]  day that individual gets censored off the internet. Now that, we're at the stage in
[1:27:55.960 --> 1:28:02.160]  Bill Melligen censorship right now, where they've now published the story in Politico.
[1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:17.640]  Do you see at the border? Do you see at the border? And it says here, the Fox News reporter
[1:28:17.640 --> 1:28:22.400]  is getting under the skin of some people in Joe Biden's administration, and he's not
[1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:29.520]  Peter Doocy, it's Bill Melligen. And so why are they mad at Bill Melligen? Because he's
[1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:34.280]  down at the border every day with a Fox News crew, with cameras, and they're showing the
[1:28:34.280 --> 1:28:39.680]  tens of thousands of illegal immigrants that come across the border every day, and talking
[1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:44.600]  to Border Patrol about the terrorists and the child rapists that they arrest. So don't
[1:28:44.600 --> 1:28:52.040]  be surprised tomorrow if Bill Melligen is off Twitter. Democrats complain about an individual,
[1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:57.320]  they write a hit piece about him, the next day he gets censored. Let's see if that happens.
[1:28:57.320 --> 1:29:03.440]  People ask me all the time, what is your best new tropic? You've got Turbo Force, you've
[1:29:03.440 --> 1:29:09.200]  got Brain Force Plus, and you've got Brain Force Ultra. Which one is better? And that's
[1:29:09.200 --> 1:29:18.480]  like asking, what's better, a Ford F-150, or a Cadillac, or a Ferrari? It's different
[1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:23.800]  strokes for different folks. It varies, all three are different formulas, all three do
[1:29:23.800 --> 1:29:29.800]  different things. Turbo Force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy, I can't even
[1:29:29.800 --> 1:29:34.720]  take a whole pack myself. Brain Force Plus is a long-term acting, clean,
[1:29:34.720 --> 1:29:42.480]  neutral. This Brain Force Ultra is a super fast acting, neutral pick that creates incredible
[1:29:42.480 --> 1:29:47.520]  clarity, but doesn't last very long. They're all three different formulas. And finally,
[1:29:47.520 --> 1:29:54.080]  back at stock, massively discounted, Brain Force Ultra is available at infowarstore.com.
[1:29:54.080 --> 1:29:58.240]  Brain Force Ultra, back at stock, infowarstore.com.
[1:29:58.240 --> 1:30:05.880]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass
[1:30:05.880 --> 1:30:11.680]  and so many other ingredients that are known to make us healthy, to make us vibrant, and
[1:30:11.680 --> 1:30:16.320]  to defend our immune systems. Now over a year and a half ago, we came out with a product
[1:30:16.320 --> 1:30:21.320]  that was top sourced, top of the line, as good as it's going to get, but then the supply
[1:30:21.320 --> 1:30:24.640]  chain broke down and it was sold out for more than a year.
[1:30:24.640 --> 1:30:30.200]  Finally, green fiber capsules, this big old bottle, jam-packed, is back in stock for a

[1:31:58.640 --> 1:32:04.840]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what
[1:32:04.840 --> 1:32:10.280]  we've known and what's to come. And right now, the most important thing to remember
[1:32:10.280 --> 1:32:16.560]  is don't panic. Stay calm, because now is the time that we must get our bearings and
[1:32:16.560 --> 1:32:23.000]  steer the ship onto a safe sound course. There is nothing stopping we the people from making
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:29.560]  our own rules and building our own society. All we gotta do is survive the crash. And
[1:32:29.560 --> 1:32:35.360]  right now, we still have time to prepare. The world fiat currency system is racing
[1:32:35.360 --> 1:32:42.000]  towards zero. It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water, and
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:49.720]  survival gear to keep us strong and at the ready. Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials,
[1:32:49.720 --> 1:32:59.440]  adorable foods, water filtration, first aid, power, and more at preparedtoday.com.
[1:32:59.440 --> 1:33:07.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:07.160 --> 1:33:21.280]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:33:21.280 --> 1:33:27.280]  you are the resistance. And now, your host, Owen Shroyer.
[1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:35.080]  I've seen the playbook before, folks, and I'm not intentionally butchering Bill Mellogen.
[1:33:35.080 --> 1:33:44.120]  Am I saying it right now? Mellogen. Mellujin. I'm not intentionally butchering the name.
[1:33:44.120 --> 1:33:51.200]  Mellujin. This playbook has been run dozens of times. It's been run against me. Democrats
[1:33:51.200 --> 1:33:55.760]  target you for censorship. They tell their friends in the media, write a hit piece on
[1:33:55.760 --> 1:34:00.080]  this individual. They then share that hit piece with their friends in Big Tech and say, censor
[1:34:00.080 --> 1:34:04.880]  this individual, and then that individual gets censored. That's how they work. And usually,
[1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:11.200]  it's Politico or Daily Beast is their go-to source. And so now, Bill Mellujin has a hit
[1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:16.000]  piece against him in Politico, and they're calling for him to get censored because he's
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:23.520]  reporting the truth on what's happening at the southern border. And now, that the Democrats
[1:34:23.520 --> 1:34:27.240]  have a problem with illegal immigration because of Ron DeSantis putting illegal immigrants
[1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:36.880]  in liberal cities. Well, they can't have their hypocrisy exposed by Bill at the border because,
[1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:41.920]  well, that would be embarrassing for them to have another one of their hypocrisies exposed
[1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:46.960]  with the illegal immigrants. Oh, 50 is too much for Martha's Vineyard, but 50,000 is
[1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:53.720]  just fine for one border town in Texas. See how that works?
[1:34:53.720 --> 1:35:03.000]  Well, now, a Democrat sheriff is putting all the Democrat Party talking points out for
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:11.520]  the media, and that's the sheriff in Bexar County. Even the Democrat sheriff investigating
[1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:15.960]  DeSantis agrees the border is not secure. Well, yeah, Sheriff Javier Salazar has to
[1:35:15.960 --> 1:35:20.960]  admit the border is not secure. He can't completely lie to the people of that town that see the
[1:35:20.960 --> 1:35:28.360]  tens of thousands showing up every day. But just keep in mind, this guy is a loyal Democrat.
[1:35:28.360 --> 1:35:35.040]  He was actually riding around on the Biden campaign bus when it was going through Texas.
[1:35:35.040 --> 1:35:38.600]  You may remember that, and it got surrounded by a bunch of Trump supporters. You may remember
[1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:43.880]  that. They're suing those Trump supporters, by the way. The Democrat Party is suing the
[1:35:43.880 --> 1:35:49.320]  Trump supporters that were riding around next to the Biden bus in Texas. And this sheriff
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:54.800]  was on that bus. So, I mean, he's thick as thieves with these Democrats. But what has
[1:35:54.800 --> 1:35:59.480]  happened on his watch with the illegal immigrants? How about the deadliest illegal immigrant
[1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:06.400]  encounter on record? At least 50 people found dead in abandoned 18-wheeler in San Antonio.
[1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:13.160]  The final number was 53. That was in his county, Bexar County, the deadliest illegal immigrant
[1:36:13.160 --> 1:36:22.600]  encounter, 53 dead in a semi-truck. But he's going to tell you about how DeSantis is bad.
[1:36:22.600 --> 1:36:27.680]  He's also got other issues that he's ignoring to attack DeSantis. Bexar County Sheriff ignores
[1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:33.840]  triple murder case, instead opens investigation into Florida Governor DeSantis. Yeah, Sheriff,
[1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:38.000]  we just had a triple murder case. Don't bother me. Okay. I'm doing work for the Democrat
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:42.160]  Party to attack the number two presidential candidate of the Republican Party. That's
[1:36:42.160 --> 1:36:48.000]  much more important. Sir, there's a murderer on the loose. Yeah, did you not hear me? I'm
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:55.720]  trying to hurt the Republican Party. That is more important. Democrats, illegal aliens
[1:36:55.720 --> 1:37:02.120]  flown to Martha's Vineyard file lawsuit against Ron DeSantis. Let's, let's call this what
[1:37:02.120 --> 1:37:09.080]  it is. The illegal immigrants are not following any lawsuits. Democrats are. Democrats went
[1:37:09.080 --> 1:37:13.080]  and they grabbed these illegal immigrants and they said, Hey, would you like to be a
[1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:17.880]  part of a lawsuit? We can make you a bunch of money and they don't know any better. Many
[1:37:17.880 --> 1:37:22.440]  of them don't even speak English. So they just say, okay, they're getting coerced. Democrats
[1:37:22.440 --> 1:37:28.800]  are now coercing illegal immigrants into litigation so that they can be used against their biggest
[1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:34.160]  political opposition ahead of the midterms and the 2024 presidential election. So Democrats
[1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:37.760]  are filing suit against lawsuit and they're a lawsuit against DeSantis and they're using
[1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:46.640]  illegal immigrants as cannon fodder to do so. There's a problem though. DeSantis office
[1:37:46.640 --> 1:37:50.880]  responds to lawsuit for Martha's Vineyard migrants points out they signed a consent
[1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:58.520]  form. Oops. Oops. So they said, Oh, they were removed without their consent. They didn't
[1:37:58.520 --> 1:38:03.200]  know where they were going. DeSantis beats you guys again. Sorry. He was ahead of the
[1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:09.400]  curve on that deal. They all signed consent forms that said exactly where they were going
[1:38:09.400 --> 1:38:15.280]  and how they were getting there. Now here's a question I have and I'd like to see Ron
[1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:23.680]  DeSantis ask this question as well because what happened? DeSantis sends 50 illegal immigrants
[1:38:23.680 --> 1:38:27.680]  to Martha's Vineyard. They all knew they were going there. They signed a consent form to
[1:38:27.680 --> 1:38:34.560]  do just that. Well, then what happened? Well, the Democrats and Martha's Vineyard in less
[1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:41.920]  than 24 hours rounded them up and put them in a bus to ship them off of the island. Okay.
[1:38:41.920 --> 1:38:47.960]  We all witnessed that. 50 illegal immigrants showed up. Democrats glad handed themselves
[1:38:47.960 --> 1:38:53.000]  that night, put them in a church and then called the military to remove them the next
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  day, which they did. Now here's my question. Did the Democrats at Martha's Vineyard get
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:11.400]  a consent form to remove the illegal immigrants? Just curious. Do you think the liberal Democrats
[1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:19.800]  at Martha's Vineyard that used the military to remove illegal immigrants from their island?
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:28.680]  Do you think they got a consent form to do that? Hmm. I'll bet you they didn't. Isn't
[1:39:28.680 --> 1:39:36.560]  that funny? DeSantis has the consent form to move the illegal immigrants from Florida
[1:39:36.560 --> 1:39:41.640]  to Martha's Vineyard. Do you have a consent form after you moved them from Martha's Vineyard?
[1:39:41.640 --> 1:39:48.760]  Do a military base in Massachusetts? Did you get that consent form? I mean, obviously,
[1:39:48.760 --> 1:39:53.880]  I mean, you must have, right? Because you're upset claiming DeSantis didn't have a consent
[1:39:53.880 --> 1:39:59.000]  form, but he did. So you guys obviously had a consent form, right? The Democrats at Martha's
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:04.400]  Vineyard must have had consent forms. 50, 53 of them, when they transferred the illegal
[1:40:04.400 --> 1:40:15.240]  immigrants, right? I mean, they, I'm sure they did. Yeah, right. More Democrat party hypocrisy
[1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:20.520]  and fraud. And then it's all the way up to New York. This is just folks. It's just hilarious,
[1:40:20.520 --> 1:40:23.760]  honestly. And if these people were about to destroy the planet and civilization as we
[1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:27.560]  know it, it would be funny. I just come on and laugh at them all day long, but they want
[1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:30.920]  to destroy our lives. They want to kill us. They want to put us all in jail. So it's not
[1:40:30.920 --> 1:40:41.000]  really that funny, is it? Mayor Eric Adams says New York City has received 7,600 migrants
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:49.640]  since May. Oh my gosh. Oh my. So less than 1% of 1% of how many illegal immigrants we've
[1:40:49.640 --> 1:40:57.520]  received here in Texas. And he says he needs help, folks. Mayor Eric Adams says he needs
[1:40:57.520 --> 1:41:03.680]  help because a couple thousand illegal immigrants have arrived since May. Mayor Adams calls
[1:41:03.680 --> 1:41:08.480]  for reassessment of New York City's right to shelter practices as migrant strain homeless
[1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:13.520]  system. Oh, you mean you don't have the infrastructure? Oh, you mean you can't handle all the illegal
[1:41:13.520 --> 1:41:18.400]  immigrants you wanted, even though you said it was a sanctuary city and you have open
[1:41:18.400 --> 1:41:24.000]  border policies? Oh, and now you can't, you can't face the music. Now it's a problem.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:30.960]  You need help. Well, Texas is needed help. Florida's needed help. This country's needed
[1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:37.400]  help. And all you've done is add to the problem and throw gasoline on the fire. Now that the
[1:41:37.400 --> 1:41:49.760]  fire's in your backyard, you want help? Hilarious. Hilarious. Sanctuary, New York City. Asylum
[1:41:49.760 --> 1:42:00.960]  seeker dies by suicide in New York City shelter. And who does Mayor Eric Adams blame? I bet
[1:42:00.960 --> 1:42:08.040]  you can guess Republicans. New York City Mayor Eric Adams blames Republicans failure for
[1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:13.320]  migrant killing himself. I mean, you Democrat liberals, you are so insufferable. You are
[1:42:13.320 --> 1:42:18.980]  such demons. You are so disconnected from anything that's good and wholesome. You promote
[1:42:18.980 --> 1:42:23.680]  open border policies. You call anyone that wants to shut down the border xenophobic.
[1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:28.000]  You then virtue signal and say that you run sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:32.640]  We then send a very small fraction of the illegal immigrants that you've brought in
[1:42:32.640 --> 1:42:36.840]  to your cities and you say you can't handle it. You need help. This is all Republicans
[1:42:36.840 --> 1:42:44.400]  fault. Diversity is strength. After all, Iraqi migrant arrested for rape of 12 year old in
[1:42:44.400 --> 1:42:51.640]  Stockholm, Sweden. Iraqi migrant arrested for rape of 12 year old in Stockholm, Sweden.
[1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:59.640]  Diversity is strength. Diversity is rape. I mean, diversity is strength. It's the fourth
[1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:05.520]  coin that we've released the last year. And I believe the most powerful, the man in the
[1:43:05.520 --> 1:43:13.720]  arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt, citizen of a republic, the man in the arena. There's only
[1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:20.000]  10,000 of this coin in existence in the world. It will never be made again. It's not just
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  an amazing historic coin. It funds the information war against the globalist. This is something
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:29.720]  you want to hand down to your grandchildren. This is something you want to own. And as
[1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:36.240]  a fundraiser, it is funding the information war against the globalist. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:43:36.240 --> 1:43:41.080]  10,000 coins are available. They'll sell out very quickly. Please be part of history and

[1:43:58.960 --> 1:44:04.240]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing
[1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:09.800]  with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[1:44:09.800 --> 1:44:16.080]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com. Studies have
[1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:22.040]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:27.600]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:34.080]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested
[1:44:34.080 --> 1:44:41.200]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:47.360]  and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and
[1:44:47.360 --> 1:44:53.720]  calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for

[1:46:59.440 --> 1:47:18.400]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:18.400 --> 1:47:22.920]  Notice how Democrats are talking about illegal immigrants' rights and illegal immigrants
[1:47:22.920 --> 1:47:27.760]  using the American court system to go after Republicans. That's odd. That's really odd,
[1:47:27.760 --> 1:47:33.600]  isn't it? How do noncitizens have rights and how can noncitizens be using the U.S. Justice
[1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:38.360]  system? Of course, they can't. That's a lie, just like I said in the last segment. It's
[1:47:38.360 --> 1:47:45.000]  the Democrats suing them and they're using illegal immigrants like a human shield basically,
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:50.080]  like a pawn that they wave in front of you. They're really sick people, aren't they? These
[1:47:50.080 --> 1:47:54.520]  Democrats, they are really, truly sick people. But oh, they'll talk about an illegal immigrant's
[1:47:54.520 --> 1:47:59.800]  rights, but they'll take your rights and American citizen.
[1:47:59.800 --> 1:48:06.040]  You know, I've got to tell you too, folks, it's not just the understanding of how real
[1:48:06.040 --> 1:48:14.760]  all this is and then the instinct of self-preservation and survival to get the hell as far away from
[1:48:14.760 --> 1:48:19.440]  Democrats as you possibly can, get the hell as far away from Democrat-run cities and population
[1:48:19.440 --> 1:48:27.440]  dense areas as you possibly can. But, you know, there's another instinct here and you
[1:48:27.440 --> 1:48:33.360]  see why it exists with what Alex Jones goes through. Folks, just coming on air and talking
[1:48:33.360 --> 1:48:39.840]  is putting yourself in a serious personal risk situation. I mean, there's an instinct
[1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:44.760]  for me to just say, just stop doing this. Just stop covering the news every day. Stop
[1:48:44.760 --> 1:48:48.640]  telling the truth about Democrats every day. Stop calling out the globalist every day because
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:53.160]  you're just marking yourself for death at their hands, for death and imprisonment at
[1:48:53.160 --> 1:49:02.960]  their hands before everyone else's. But see, there's a conflict in that your survival instinct
[1:49:02.960 --> 1:49:10.080]  also understands that fighting these tyrants is survival. Standing up against these tyrants
[1:49:10.080 --> 1:49:16.920]  is survival. Maybe not for you individually, but for human freedom and prosperity. But
[1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:22.920]  again, you wouldn't have liberal Democrat policy without hypocrisy. And here's Ron DeSantis
[1:49:22.920 --> 1:49:30.200]  calling that out in clip five, dealing with the illegal immigrants and the lawsuits now
[1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:35.400]  being filed against him for what the Democrats have been doing since Biden got into office.
[1:49:35.400 --> 1:49:36.400]  Anybody? Yes?
[1:49:36.400 --> 1:49:49.520]  So, when Biden is flying these people all over the fruited planet, he's going to be
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:50:07.040]  killed. So, when Biden is flying these people all over the fruited planet in the middle
[1:50:07.040 --> 1:50:17.960]  of the night, I didn't hear a peep out of those people, okay? I didn't hear a peep.
[1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:22.560]  I haven't heard a peep about all the people that have been told by Biden you can just
[1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:27.560]  come in and they're going, they're being abused by the cartels, they're drowning in the Rio
[1:50:27.560 --> 1:50:33.520]  Grande. You had 50 that died in some shed in Texas. I heard no outrage about any of
[1:50:33.520 --> 1:50:38.080]  that. I haven't heard outrage about all the fence and all that's come across the border
[1:50:38.080 --> 1:50:45.480]  that's killing Americans in record numbers. I don't hear outrage about the criminal aliens
[1:50:45.480 --> 1:50:50.440]  that have gotten through and have then victimized people not only in Florida but all throughout
[1:50:50.440 --> 1:50:54.640]  the country. I didn't hear any outrage about that. The only thing I hear them getting upset
[1:50:54.640 --> 1:51:01.440]  about is you have 50 that end up in Martha's Vineyard. Then they get really upset. And
[1:51:01.440 --> 1:51:12.280]  I'm sorry. Those migrants were being treated horribly by Biden. They were hungry, homeless.
[1:51:12.280 --> 1:51:17.880]  They had no opportunity at all. The state of Florida, it was volunteer, offered transport
[1:51:17.880 --> 1:51:23.760]  to sanctuary jurisdictions because it's our view that, one, the border should be secured.
[1:51:23.760 --> 1:51:29.360]  And we want to have Biden re-institute policies like Remain in Mexico and making sure that
[1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:34.520]  people aren't overwhelming. But short of that, if you believe in open borders, then this
[1:51:34.520 --> 1:51:39.400]  is the sanctuary jurisdictions that should have to bear the brunt of the open borders.
[1:51:39.400 --> 1:51:46.240]  So that's what we're doing. But what happened was they were provided an ability to be in
[1:51:46.240 --> 1:51:52.680]  the most posh sanctuary jurisdiction, maybe in the world. And obviously it's sad that
[1:51:52.680 --> 1:51:57.120]  Martha's Vineyard people deported them the next day. They could have absorbed this. They
[1:51:57.120 --> 1:52:03.240]  chose not to. But what it shows is if 50 was a burden on one of the richest places in our
[1:52:03.240 --> 1:52:08.520]  country, what about all these other communities that have been overrun with hundreds or thousands
[1:52:08.520 --> 1:52:14.320]  of dollars? It shows you when now these policies are on the front burner, people need to be
[1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:21.240]  talking about Biden can't defend his policies of open borders. It's doing huge damage to
[1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:25.840]  our country. It's costing a lot of money. It's costing lives with the drugs that are
[1:52:25.840 --> 1:52:31.800]  pouring across. And so the question is, is why are you supporting Biden's policies? Why
[1:52:31.800 --> 1:52:37.480]  don't you step up and tell him you're failing and let's do it differently? Because you
[1:52:37.480 --> 1:52:44.200]  know what? He inherited a border that wasn't like this. He has created the crisis. But
[1:52:44.200 --> 1:52:50.840]  now at least we know nobody can deny that there's a crisis. Everybody now knows. And
[1:52:50.840 --> 1:52:56.520]  it was only because you had to have the elite who want to have the cost on everybody else
[1:52:56.520 --> 1:53:00.400]  and they don't want to have to shoulder that. That's the only reason now people are talking
[1:53:00.400 --> 1:53:16.320]  about this. And of course, everything he just said is completely 100% accurate. But the
[1:53:16.320 --> 1:53:23.800]  truth doesn't seem to really cause any issues for Democrats, does it? The truth never gets
[1:53:23.800 --> 1:53:28.240]  in the way of a good Democrat lie. The truth never gets in the way of a good Democrat tyrannical
[1:53:28.240 --> 1:53:35.320]  operation, does it? It just begs the question, what do we have to do, man? What do we have
[1:53:35.320 --> 1:53:40.400]  to do to protect ourselves from these Democrat tyrants? What do we have to do to protect
[1:53:40.400 --> 1:53:45.960]  ourselves from their policies that are crushing us? It's a real question. I mean, seriously,
[1:53:45.960 --> 1:53:52.440]  what do we do? Everything Ron DeSantis did was great. Everything Ron DeSantis said was
[1:53:52.440 --> 1:53:58.920]  great. So what is he dealing with now? He's getting sued by Democrats. I mean, it's just,
[1:53:58.920 --> 1:54:07.280]  oh man, and that's why sadly, well, maybe not so sadly, I don't know, it's sad that you
[1:54:07.280 --> 1:54:16.040]  feel your only hope is to pray to God because there seems to be no human option, no peaceful
[1:54:16.040 --> 1:54:21.720]  political human option left to deal with these Democrat tyrants. And I'm not a violent person,
[1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:29.640]  never going to call for violence. I didn't sign up to be in the military. You know, so
[1:54:29.640 --> 1:54:36.240]  but I'll tell you what, you know who did? Putin and Russians. And they're trying to
[1:54:36.240 --> 1:54:44.480]  tell us that if you don't deal with your criminal politicians, we got nukes and they're fighting
[1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:58.480]  us right now in Ukraine. Man, unbelievable stuff. Now, coming up in the next hour, we're
[1:54:58.480 --> 1:55:08.800]  going to be joined by Alan dos Santos, who is a Brazilian journalist and commentator
[1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:15.880]  who dealt with the liberals and the communist in Brazil who banned him from his home country.
[1:55:15.880 --> 1:55:20.720]  That's what communists do when you tell the truth in media. And so he got banned. His
[1:55:20.720 --> 1:55:24.920]  operation got censored. I mean, in a lot of ways, Alan is kind of like the Brazilian
[1:55:24.920 --> 1:55:29.800]  Alex Jones. So of course, he's been censored and lied about and excommunicated by the
[1:55:29.800 --> 1:55:34.380]  commies in Brazil. But I'm not having him on to talk about himself. I'm having him on
[1:55:34.380 --> 1:55:42.000]  to talk about a big story developing in Brazil right now where a former president of Brazil,
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:47.560]  Lula, who had been tried and convicted of crimes of money laundering in one of the most
[1:55:47.560 --> 1:55:53.440]  famous political corruption cases of all time, Operation Car Wash in Brazil, the communist
[1:55:53.440 --> 1:56:04.160]  Supreme Court released him from jail and now he's running for president again. Again. And
[1:56:04.160 --> 1:56:08.240]  it's kind of a weird thing when I'm hosting the Jones show and the war room because there's
[1:56:08.240 --> 1:56:13.920]  kind of some crossfire where if you follow the war room, but then I follow up with the
[1:56:13.920 --> 1:56:16.920]  story on the Jones show and then you look for it on the war room and you don't see it
[1:56:16.920 --> 1:56:22.920]  or vice versa. So I was explaining how I've got a lot of friends in Brazil, some close
[1:56:22.920 --> 1:56:29.440]  friends and some of them are, you know, conservatives, you can say some of them are liberals, but
[1:56:29.440 --> 1:56:34.600]  the liberals were the ones that hated Lula the most. And so when I saw that polls were
[1:56:34.600 --> 1:56:38.960]  saying that Lula was winning, I was just stunned. And so I actually heard back from
[1:56:38.960 --> 1:56:43.320]  some of my liberal Brazilian friends and I asked, I said, yeah, I know you're not a
[1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:47.120]  big Bulls and Arrows fan, but I mean, what do you think about they're saying Lula is
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:50.960]  now leading in the polls and they're just stunned. They're like, I can't believe it.
[1:56:50.960 --> 1:56:57.280]  He's corrupt. He got caught and they're upset. But see, that's what happens when you have
[1:56:57.280 --> 1:57:01.640]  a real leader. You might not think Bulls and Arrows perfect. You might not think Donald
[1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:06.960]  Trump is perfect. They're real leaders, folks. They're real independent men that want to
[1:57:06.960 --> 1:57:12.080]  be real presidents and lead their country to victory. Doesn't mean they're not flawed.
[1:57:12.080 --> 1:57:18.040]  Doesn't mean they won't make mistakes. But what happens when a true populist leader arises,
[1:57:18.040 --> 1:57:23.720]  they have to destroy him and they have to cheat to remove him from office. And just like
[1:57:23.720 --> 1:57:29.000]  they did in the US, they're now doing in Brazil. So Alan Dos Santos, who you might call the
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:38.880]  Alex Jones of Brazil is going to be joining us in the next hour. Incredible stuff. You
[1:57:38.880 --> 1:57:43.520]  know what though? I just hope I'm alive to see it. All of this corruption will someday
[1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:49.480]  come to an end and a true age of prosperity will begin.
[1:57:49.480 --> 1:57:54.200]  The bestselling book in America last week was The Great Reset and the War for the Worlds
[1:57:54.200 --> 1:58:00.720]  written by Alex Jones. Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week. But the
[1:58:00.720 --> 1:58:03.800]  New York Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that.
[1:58:03.800 --> 1:58:07.480]  The New York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New
[1:58:07.480 --> 1:58:12.160]  York Times. The paper that started the Iraq War by lying about weapons mass destruction
[1:58:12.160 --> 1:58:15.520]  and got a million people killed. So they lied about his book.
[1:58:15.520 --> 1:58:20.960]  The Great Reset and the War for the World, the historic book that lays out the plans
[1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:29.240]  of the Great Reset Death Star and exposes the New World Order's plans for global enslavement.

[1:58:53.520 --> 1:58:59.120]  system, for your brain, for every part of your body. But what I don't see being promoted
[1:58:59.120 --> 1:59:06.920]  is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects. It certainly does for me. When I
[1:59:06.920 --> 1:59:12.840]  take a couple of these capsules from an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing.
[1:59:12.840 --> 1:59:18.720]  Now there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain.

[1:59:23.240 --> 1:59:26.920]  it's good for your brain. We know it's good for your arteries and veins and your lungs
[1:59:26.920 --> 1:59:31.400]  and every other function of your body. But I want you to experience this high grade fish

[1:59:59.280 --> 2:00:04.640]  There are several ways to support this broadcast and the biggest is by getting the fourth coin
[2:00:04.640 --> 2:00:11.320]  at 1776coin.com or patreoncollectibles.com that is the man in the arena. Got a gladiator
[2:00:11.320 --> 2:00:17.960]  on the back. It's got Teddy Roosevelt on the front. It's the fourth coin and just like
[2:00:17.960 --> 2:00:24.320]  NPR does where they'll sell a ball cap for 50 bucks and a t-shirt for 100 bucks or whatever.
[2:00:24.320 --> 2:00:28.440]  This has a big markup on it. This is a piece of industry limited edition coin to fundraise
[2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:34.440]  and fight the Democratic Party lawsuits and to keep us on air and to be successfully profitable
[2:00:34.440 --> 2:00:39.280]  in this bankruptcy so we stay on air. Do you understand? That's where we're at. So thank
[2:00:39.280 --> 2:00:43.040]  you for your support. I know we're in a depression. I know it's hard. It's your choice whether
[2:00:43.040 --> 2:00:48.480]  you want to keep us on air or not. Everybody should go to 1776coin.com right now and get
[2:00:48.480 --> 2:00:55.040]  the coin. It's a piece of history and you'll know you put up a fight. There's nowhere
[2:00:55.040 --> 2:01:00.280]  where you can more easily make a donation and get a piece of history and a coin and know
[2:01:00.280 --> 2:01:05.440]  that you were part of the fight. You cannot find a place and it's God's will that did
[2:01:05.440 --> 2:01:09.840]  this, not me. We have more effect. We have world leaders listening. We have all the big
[2:01:09.840 --> 2:01:13.600]  podcasters listening. Everything we talked about 20 years ago has come true. Our credibility
[2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:19.200]  is incredibly high. That's why the enemies of freedom are in a rage, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:01:19.200 --> 2:01:24.720]  to shut us down. So get the Teddy Roosevelt coin now. When they're gone, they're gone.
[2:01:24.720 --> 2:01:30.440]  1776coin.com or patriotcollectibles.com. You can also get signed fundraiser books, only
[2:01:30.440 --> 2:01:35.600]  place to get them at infoworkstore.com. The great reset in the war for the world. They'll

[2:01:42.600 --> 2:01:46.560]  with it months ahead. Don't fight the crowds. Don't fight all the crap. This is do or die
[2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:50.880]  time, folks. And I'm going to explain it again. If you let the new world order take over,
[2:01:50.880 --> 2:01:55.000]  if you let them continue their design collapse, it's here. It's not coming. You're going
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:02:00.720]  to wish later you've done something now. Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on
[2:02:00.720 --> 2:02:06.200]  the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like, at least in government. But
[2:02:06.200 --> 2:02:10.640]  there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's
[2:02:10.640 --> 2:02:16.600]  corporations. The left have wised up to this. If you want to stop someone from telling the
[2:02:16.600 --> 2:02:22.120]  truth, use companies to do it. The social media giants, and they are. For many on the
[2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:27.400]  left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevents them from speaking.
[2:02:27.400 --> 2:02:30.480]  So far, the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been
[2:02:30.480 --> 2:02:34.800]  the radio show host, Alex Jones. There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party
[2:02:34.800 --> 2:02:39.080]  and multinational corporations in Big Tech to silence conservative and nationalist and
[2:02:39.080 --> 2:02:44.000]  populist voices. There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:49.120]  and saying, can you ban this person? He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist,
[2:02:49.120 --> 2:02:54.440]  but this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find. Shame on the mainstream,
[2:02:54.440 --> 2:02:58.800]  corporate media, for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack dogging, calling
[2:02:58.800 --> 2:03:03.680]  for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press, working with Big Tech. People
[2:03:03.680 --> 2:03:11.800]  know what's true. They can smell it. Infowars, the most banned network in the world. In a
[2:03:11.800 --> 2:03:19.160]  free country, everyone can be heard. In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be heard.
[2:03:19.160 --> 2:03:22.560]  I'm going to say this front and center right up front. I'm leaving it all in the field.
[2:03:22.560 --> 2:03:28.360]  I love my crew. I love you all. We are in a Chapter 5 bankruptcy to be able to show
[2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:33.000]  we're solvent, but to show the courts we don't have all these extra money. The Democrat
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:39.640]  Party law firms are suing for. So this organization coming out of Chapter 5, Infowars and Free
[2:03:39.640 --> 2:03:46.560]  Speech Bill to operate basically forever, because we'll just have a plan on what can
[2:03:46.560 --> 2:03:52.960]  be paid to these people versus what they're claiming we have. And then you're truly basically
[2:03:52.960 --> 2:03:56.800]  won't get paid or a very small amount. That's fine. I don't care about that. I want to stay
[2:03:56.800 --> 2:04:03.080]  on the air. But if we don't make it through Chapter 5 the next five weeks, it's a 13-week
[2:04:03.080 --> 2:04:11.040]  process. We're already seven weeks into it. Then this place is going bye-bye. So we are
[2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:15.960]  right there, ladies and gentlemen, on the cusp. All you got to do is go to infowarsstore.com.

[2:06:08.240 --> 2:06:14.520]  Well the great host of Testra Livre, Alan Dos Santos, my friend, probably doesn't speak
[2:06:14.520 --> 2:06:20.640]  over his own liners like I do. Joins me now. He's been banned. He's been censored. He's
[2:06:20.640 --> 2:06:24.600]  been lied about. He's been attacked, but he's never stopped fighting. And we love him for
[2:06:24.600 --> 2:06:30.960]  it. And so Alan, you know, I've got a little bit of a soft spot in my heart for Brazil.
[2:06:30.960 --> 2:06:37.560]  And I've got friends out there. Of course, it's your home country. And when I saw new
[2:06:37.560 --> 2:06:44.800]  polls out of Brazil that Lula was ahead of Bolsonaro. First of all, I didn't believe
[2:06:44.800 --> 2:06:51.640]  it because Bolsonaro's popularity seems to continue to be rising since he was elected.
[2:06:51.640 --> 2:06:58.000]  And then secondly, because Lula, the disgraced president, the arrested president, Operation
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:03.320]  Car Wash caught guilty president. And so I couldn't think of anybody better to come on
[2:07:03.320 --> 2:07:08.600]  air today with me to try to explain this phenomenon and make sense of it. And so let me just kind
[2:07:08.600 --> 2:07:13.520]  of lay out my understanding and you correct my course if I'm wrong or add the details.
[2:07:13.520 --> 2:07:18.640]  The same communist supreme court that tried to banish you from the country and successfully
[2:07:18.640 --> 2:07:25.200]  did released Lula from jail. And now he's thrown his hat into the ring. And I guess the fake
[2:07:25.200 --> 2:07:30.960]  news media has propped him up as the lead candidate. Do I have that right, Alan?
[2:07:30.960 --> 2:07:38.320]  Oh, and it's a very pleasure for me to be here and show and yeah, you're right. So this
[2:07:38.320 --> 2:07:42.720]  is what happening right now in Brazil. The same thing that happened in the United States
[2:07:42.720 --> 2:07:49.600]  when the elite gets together with the people that control the country and the elite of
[2:07:49.600 --> 2:07:55.600]  the bureaucrat to they want to change what people want. Because for a long time we have
[2:07:55.600 --> 2:08:02.160]  been sleeping about the communism. So a lot of Brazilian people, religious people, people
[2:08:02.160 --> 2:08:08.640]  involved with conservative conservative conservatism movement and so forth, they have been sleeping
[2:08:08.640 --> 2:08:16.600]  for decades. So now we are waking up due to Professor Olavo de Carvalho teaching people
[2:08:16.600 --> 2:08:22.680]  what is communism indeed, and due to Bolsonaro politically, because Bolsonaro was showing
[2:08:22.680 --> 2:08:32.000]  to people that we had hope. We can have hope. We need to have hope and we can elect a truly
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:38.600]  person that will represent the people and Bolsonaro did it. He got it. And his popularity
[2:08:38.600 --> 2:08:45.680]  is rising as more that people think so. You could see that in London where, for example,
[2:08:45.680 --> 2:08:55.240]  Macron was booed by his own people and Bolsonaro was praised. People on the street was screaming
[2:08:55.240 --> 2:09:02.840]  to him, saying, please, president, save us from communism. Bolsonaro is a strong man
[2:09:02.840 --> 2:09:10.440]  because he's fighting not only the communists, but all the bureaucrats in its heart.
[2:09:10.440 --> 2:09:14.040]  Let's just briefly, we don't have to go off into too much of the details, but let's lay
[2:09:14.040 --> 2:09:18.800]  this out for audience members that might not understand or know the story about Operation
[2:09:18.800 --> 2:09:25.440]  Car Wash. Lula was president of Brazil some years ago and there were investigations with
[2:09:25.440 --> 2:09:30.080]  money laundering and other shenanigans. He was arrested in Operation Car Wash. What are
[2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:35.920]  just some of the basic details of Operation Car Wash so that the audience can understand?
[2:09:35.920 --> 2:09:43.960]  So to try to pass some bills and laws at the Congress, the Workers' Party was bribing all
[2:09:43.960 --> 2:09:52.040]  the congressmen to do so. So this was a very huge scheme to change everything, even change
[2:09:52.040 --> 2:09:55.840]  the constitution because in Brazil it's different than here. There are some points that you
[2:09:55.840 --> 2:10:03.120]  can change the constitution. And so that's what they got. They were installing the communism
[2:10:03.120 --> 2:10:12.480]  in Brazil and somehow they were paying the congressmen to do so. But the problem is,
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:19.720]  all this scheme went too far and when all this corruption went too far, someone got
[2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:27.120]  caught. And once the first one got caught, it wasn't a very well-trained communist that
[2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:37.360]  will keep silent. So then they start to talk who was responsible for it. So basically Lula
[2:10:37.360 --> 2:10:46.360]  was really, really, really condemned by the court. And the Supreme Court later, bureaucratically
[2:10:46.360 --> 2:10:54.400]  speaking was just saying, you know, when you cook your food, not in a kitchen, but you
[2:10:54.400 --> 2:11:00.880]  cook that in your room, for example. So they just say, okay, the trial wasn't valid because
[2:11:00.880 --> 2:11:10.640]  it doesn't supposed to be in a federal court like that. But we all know Lula is really
[2:11:10.640 --> 2:11:19.400]  a person that was guilty for all those crimes. And the biggest corruption scheme in crime
[2:11:19.400 --> 2:11:24.520]  in Brazil, and I think one of the biggest in the world, a lot of money. When I see corruption,
[2:11:24.520 --> 2:11:30.320]  he in America, people talking about the millions here, million there. And Brazil was billion,
[2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:35.560]  more than a billion. Some of them say that it can get trillion. So it's crazy, you know,
[2:11:35.560 --> 2:11:45.080]  it's a lot of money. And they released Lula one year before the election just to make
[2:11:45.080 --> 2:11:52.960]  him some strong person to fight Bolsonaro. During the elections, it's not working because
[2:11:52.960 --> 2:12:00.800]  Lula can't go to the streets. And he was known for gathering people gathering the poor,
[2:12:00.800 --> 2:12:09.160]  you know, on his protests and rallies, odd stuff. But now only Bolsonaro gather people.
[2:12:09.160 --> 2:12:15.320]  And it's like here in America, you know, young people, old people, people in a wheelchair.
[2:12:15.320 --> 2:12:22.160]  And the Supreme Court says it's anti anti Democrat manifestation is like anti anti Democrat,
[2:12:22.160 --> 2:12:30.360]  putting your t-shirt, the green and the yellow from the Brazilian flag, and just asking for
[2:12:30.360 --> 2:12:38.640]  someone save the people from communism. How can that be in anti Democrat? So this is basically
[2:12:38.640 --> 2:12:43.240]  trying to summarize everything. That's basically what's going on in Brazil. And it's not just
[2:12:43.240 --> 2:12:48.960]  about corruption. Oh, and we all know that Lula the silver financed all the communist
[2:12:48.960 --> 2:12:56.960]  country in South America, like Argentina, like Bolivia, Venezuela, now Chile, Colombia.
[2:12:56.960 --> 2:13:03.000]  Brazil was kind of a bank for them. You know, and now China is offering money. And we all
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  know that China is behind all of it. And then trying to shut Bolsonaro down just to make
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:14.240]  the Brazil their backyard. And of course, just so people have a better context of the
[2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:19.920]  situation, Bolsonaro is like the Brazilian Trump folks. I mean, the populist revolution,
[2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:25.000]  the popularity, the rallies, I mean, quite frankly, you know, we talk about Trump rallies
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:30.560]  being big events and parties. Bolsonaro rallies are even bigger, folks, they're even bigger.
[2:13:30.560 --> 2:13:34.640]  They're even bit more of a party atmosphere, more of a festive atmosphere, more of a patriotic
[2:13:34.640 --> 2:13:40.280]  atmosphere, but it's the same energy. So you understand why they're going after Bolzano.
[2:13:40.280 --> 2:13:45.560]  But just getting back to the operation car wash. So the Supreme Court, though, they didn't
[2:13:45.560 --> 2:13:51.600]  declare that Lula was innocent. They just said because you tried him in the wrong court
[2:13:51.600 --> 2:13:56.840]  by our measurement, even though he's guilty, we're going to release him from jail.
[2:13:56.840 --> 2:14:04.200]  Yes. I'm not a lawyer to say that in English. It's hard for me. But what I can explain to
[2:14:04.200 --> 2:14:10.600]  you all, they basically were discussing about the legitimacy of it and not the the case
[2:14:10.600 --> 2:14:17.360]  in C, you know, it's like, this is not the place that he would be on trial. But nobody
[2:14:17.360 --> 2:14:22.360]  say that he was innocent. I can try to make a little analogy. The analogy
[2:14:22.360 --> 2:14:28.080]  would be like, folks, it'd be like if you're in a court case, and they've got video of
[2:14:28.080 --> 2:14:31.720]  the defendant killing someone, and it's on video, and you're like, well, there's the
[2:14:31.720 --> 2:14:40.480]  video. So okay, he's obviously guilty. But then they find out that the prosecution edited
[2:14:40.480 --> 2:14:44.200]  something in the video, just a small little thing in the video, let's say maybe they edited
[2:14:44.200 --> 2:14:48.680]  one corner of it for one thing or edited something out. And then they say, well, you edited the
[2:14:48.680 --> 2:14:53.040]  video. So we have to release this guy, even though we know he committed the murder. So
[2:14:53.040 --> 2:14:56.760]  it's a technicality. They knew he was guilty. They released him anyway.
[2:14:56.760 --> 2:15:04.040]  It's more than this. The problem is, let us say that you the person was caught on video
[2:15:04.040 --> 2:15:10.520]  doing the killing or the stealing, whatever. But the problem is, let us say this is a state
[2:15:10.520 --> 2:15:15.600]  problem. Okay, there's a state crime. And and everything is started in a federal crime.
[2:15:15.600 --> 2:15:22.360]  You know, it's it nobody said nobody added anything. Nobody did anything. Everyone know
[2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:27.000]  everyone knows that he is guilty for everything that he has done. But the problem is they
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:32.720]  started it on the federal court. So that was the problem.
[2:15:32.720 --> 2:15:38.200]  So as a procedural, it was a procedural issue, either way, though. So I'm going to get to
[2:15:38.200 --> 2:15:42.520]  this on the other side of this break, because this is the question. So everybody knows Lula
[2:15:42.520 --> 2:15:46.200]  was guilty. They never said he wasn't guilty. They just said because of the process, we're
[2:15:46.200 --> 2:15:50.000]  going to release him. Obviously, that's because they wanted him to run against Bolsonaro.
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:54.680]  So my question on the other side of the break will be, are the polls real? Is Lula really
[2:15:54.680 --> 2:15:56.960]  ahead?

[2:20:18.840 --> 2:20:26.360]  The great Alan Dos Santos is with us. Glad to be joined by him. And so we were covering
[2:20:26.360 --> 2:20:31.880]  how the, I mean it was called the greatest political scandal in world history. Multiple
[2:20:31.880 --> 2:20:36.360]  mainstream outlets called Operation Car Wash with the former Brazilian president Lula de
[2:20:36.360 --> 2:20:40.760]  Silva the greatest political corruption in U.S. history or the world history excuse me
[2:20:40.760 --> 2:20:44.280]  at least that we know of that got caught all came out in the court of law and resulted
[2:20:44.280 --> 2:20:50.320]  in arrest and so the communist supreme court though has released Lula from jail and he's
[2:20:50.320 --> 2:20:54.000]  running for president again. I mean folks this is crazy stuff but that's what's going
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:21:02.720]  on and now polls are saying that Lula is actually ahead of Bolsonaro. Now from any neutral observer
[2:21:02.720 --> 2:21:08.240]  you can look and see how popular Bolsonaro is not just in Brazil but around the world.
[2:21:08.240 --> 2:21:14.240]  Now for somebody that's informed an anti-communist like me I understand the importance of Bolsonaro's
[2:21:14.240 --> 2:21:18.920]  leadership in Brazil and for the world and I would even argue right now that Bolsonaro
[2:21:18.920 --> 2:21:23.400]  is probably the best world leader that we have. So of course the communists have to
[2:21:23.400 --> 2:21:32.080]  remove him from office but Alan I was asking some of my more liberal Brazilian friends about
[2:21:32.080 --> 2:21:36.320]  these poll numbers and Lula and they're like stunned they're saying they can't believe
[2:21:36.320 --> 2:21:39.800]  it they can't believe this corrupt leader is back and these are liberals by the way they
[2:21:39.800 --> 2:21:44.560]  don't really necessarily like Bolsonaro and they and they're just stunned they can't believe
[2:21:44.560 --> 2:21:50.460]  it's so corrupt so are the polls fake is Lula really ahead of Bolsonaro or is this just
[2:21:50.460 --> 2:21:59.760]  entirely fabricated your thoughts Alan dos Santos. To be honest with you 100% fake because
[2:21:59.760 --> 2:22:05.240]  first of all the parties in Brazil we do not have just two parties like in America two
[2:22:05.240 --> 2:22:11.120]  big parties we have a lot of parties in Brazil more than 20 so the parties they hired private
[2:22:11.120 --> 2:22:19.360]  companies to make their own pool they cannot publish it they cannot publicize it and within
[2:22:19.360 --> 2:22:24.960]  them you know they know Bolsonaro is ahead so this is why some people are now saying
[2:22:24.960 --> 2:22:31.720]  I'm I'm for Bolsonaro since I was a child you know but they they are not but and this
[2:22:31.720 --> 2:22:36.600]  is a sign you know this is a perfect sign that Bolsonaro is ahead so this political
[2:22:36.600 --> 2:22:43.560]  this politician that weren't that anti-communist but they want to support Bolsonaro now and
[2:22:43.560 --> 2:22:51.600]  everyone knows I mean if you go if you just see the rallies you know it's very short gathering
[2:22:51.600 --> 2:22:57.560]  when you see Lula da Silva and when you see Bolsonaro it's massive even places that used
[2:22:57.560 --> 2:23:06.120]  to be very very very brainwashed by the communists and this is a poor country so it's easy to
[2:23:06.120 --> 2:23:13.280]  sell promises you know sell paradise for them and this place is now do not believe in communism
[2:23:13.280 --> 2:23:18.640]  anymore they do not they do not believe in socialism and when I say socialism and communism
[2:23:18.640 --> 2:23:24.240]  it's not a figure of speech if you ask these people they they really will condemn communism
[2:23:24.240 --> 2:23:32.200]  socialism and they will say I'm for Bolsonaro and this is very very impressive because imagine
[2:23:32.200 --> 2:23:40.320]  it decades of brainwashing brainwashed people by the university by the media by the some
[2:23:40.320 --> 2:23:45.920]  priests Catholic priests and and Protestant pastors that back in time were supporting
[2:23:45.920 --> 2:23:52.160]  the socialist agenda somehow or the socialist politicians they are not doing that anymore
[2:23:52.160 --> 2:23:59.920]  you know and and it's clear that some companies that's the funniest part that some companies
[2:23:59.920 --> 2:24:07.080]  some private companies that is publishing the polls there are somehow partners with
[2:24:07.080 --> 2:24:15.080]  some politicians or some businessmen that we all know is used to use to know as a supported
[2:24:15.080 --> 2:24:22.280]  communist agenda so it's you can't believe on this post you know although I would dare
[2:24:22.280 --> 2:24:29.680]  to say that we still have a lot of people that need to be clear fire you know they need
[2:24:29.680 --> 2:24:36.720]  to know exactly what Lula the silver agenda is what is the communist agenda and must among
[2:24:36.720 --> 2:24:43.920]  the poor people but even them they are waking up you know it's hard for the workers party
[2:24:43.920 --> 2:24:54.320]  now realize that the poor in people that are not you know very smart in a sense of politics
[2:24:54.320 --> 2:24:59.320]  politics agenda and strategy and tactics even these people now are waking up and this is
[2:24:59.320 --> 2:25:07.640]  why they hate free speech they hate free press like infowars like terça livre because we
[2:25:07.640 --> 2:25:14.200]  get in touch with these people we talk to them we explain to them in their own words
[2:25:14.200 --> 2:25:23.000]  what is going on what media do not do you know and this is why they hate such a free
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:30.480]  press like infowars Alex Jones you terça livre in my in my staff because we talk to these
[2:25:30.480 --> 2:25:37.320]  people the rest of the people that the workers party is still counting on these few people
[2:25:37.320 --> 2:25:43.320]  there is two in doubt you know they are running away from them since they got here you know
[2:25:43.320 --> 2:25:49.880]  I think you have the same experience here in America when people are kind of lost you
[2:25:49.880 --> 2:25:57.680]  know trying to see what's going on and then even if you count on these people on the poll
[2:25:57.680 --> 2:26:02.840]  in your interview some of them later on they will watch something like infowars and then
[2:26:02.840 --> 2:26:08.760]  they open their eyes and they see what's what was going on they change their mind so even
[2:26:08.760 --> 2:26:13.840]  even if you count with these doubt people you know people in doubt if you count with
[2:26:13.840 --> 2:26:21.320]  them it's not enough to get the numbers that they are showing on polls bottom line is you
[2:26:21.320 --> 2:26:25.840]  don't believe in the polls I don't believe in the polls they rigged the polls here just
[2:26:25.840 --> 2:26:32.080]  like they do there and to me the body of evidence is just look at the real world balls and arrow
[2:26:32.080 --> 2:26:36.480]  has massive rallies I mean folks I've seen rallies it looks like millions of people I
[2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:41.640]  mean just crazy stuff just like Trump was having huge rallies and then the Lula tiny
[2:26:41.640 --> 2:26:47.160]  little rallies Biden doesn't even have rallies now I obviously don't follow the the bigger
[2:26:47.160 --> 2:26:52.960]  picture of Brazil you know I'm watching that news I'm very concerned for this planet and
[2:26:52.960 --> 2:26:57.400]  I know Bolsonaro as the president of Brazil gives the world hope to me that we can have
[2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:03.440]  a good leader down there but it appears to me that you know Brazil's had its problems
[2:27:03.440 --> 2:27:07.640]  it's come out of the age of communism it's got a lot of violent crime but it appears
[2:27:07.640 --> 2:27:13.080]  to me that things have gotten better truly they have gotten better under Bolsonaro dealing
[2:27:13.080 --> 2:27:19.400]  with the crime economically doing better the unification the patriotism as opposed to
[2:27:19.400 --> 2:27:24.240]  Argentina that seems to be slipping more towards the left again more towards the communist
[2:27:24.240 --> 2:27:29.000]  mindset again they're failing economically they're they're having crime problems again
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:34.640]  where Brazil is going the other direction is that a fair is that a fair breakdown of
[2:27:34.640 --> 2:27:40.080]  what we're seeing between those two big great countries in South America oh definitely even
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:47.120]  after COVID Bolsonaro kept the country economically healthy and we are talking about a country
[2:27:47.120 --> 2:27:54.960]  that was exploit and destroyed economically by the communist party we are talking about
[2:27:54.960 --> 2:28:02.960]  the third country you know a very poor country but very rich at the same time so even even
[2:28:02.960 --> 2:28:09.840]  with all these corruptions I don't know if you have saw Bolsonaro saying at the UN
[2:28:09.840 --> 2:28:17.440]  we paid all the debts from these companies that the workers party was stealing money from
[2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:26.000]  and even paying back everyone even set it up the country even you know trying to revival
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:33.160]  everything in Brazil Bolsonaro is doing a great job even economically you said the crime
[2:28:33.160 --> 2:28:41.560]  rate in Brazil is so low so low that we are now at the same crime rate like a 10 or more
[2:28:41.560 --> 2:28:46.800]  than 10 or more than 15 years ago folks that's amazing because I mean we can talk about this
[2:28:46.800 --> 2:28:50.400]  on the other side of the break but that is truly a great accomplishment for Bolsonaro
[2:28:50.400 --> 2:28:54.800]  that people don't talk about because of course communist breed crime free market erases it
[2:28:54.800 --> 2:29:03.680]  the rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass
[2:29:03.680 --> 2:29:09.480]  and so many other ingredients that are known to make us healthy to make us vibrant and

[2:32:05.440 --> 2:32:10.000]  pushing their propaganda of New York Times other major newspapers that the family as
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:15.680]  we know it is a bad thing and must be ended the first step in that is getting women out
[2:32:15.680 --> 2:32:21.080]  of the household and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters
[2:32:21.080 --> 2:32:26.000]  and husbands is a bad thing and I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my
[2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:29.600]  daughter my four national daughter my wife makes dinner a lot of times but I like to
[2:32:29.600 --> 2:32:33.640]  make it as well I love to make breakfast and literally it's the funnest thing on earth
[2:32:33.640 --> 2:32:38.720]  to make food for your family and be nurtured tips and then all sit down together and have
[2:32:38.720 --> 2:32:45.000]  the communal event and that's what the system is attacking and bombarding is our normal
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:50.640]  biological actions and coming together they really are sick evil scientific cult of filth
[2:32:50.640 --> 2:32:58.960]  and domesticate us and turn us into lab rats we cannot let this continue leading a frontal
[2:32:58.960 --> 2:33:17.120]  assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[2:33:17.120 --> 2:33:25.840]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny will so does he live
[2:33:25.840 --> 2:33:34.360]  from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex Jones and now your host Owen Troyer with Alan
[2:33:34.360 --> 2:33:40.360]  Dos Santos from Tessera Leverett and I want to talk about more of the situation in Brazil
[2:33:40.360 --> 2:33:46.200]  but I do actually Alan eventually want to talk about how you've been how your news organization
[2:33:46.200 --> 2:33:50.560]  has been since the censorship it's it's been a while since we've caught up on that issue
[2:33:50.560 --> 2:33:53.680]  so it's great to see you at the desk with the microphone and that beautiful banner behind
[2:33:53.680 --> 2:33:59.800]  you but getting back where we left off to the Brazil issue with crime it you know was
[2:33:59.800 --> 2:34:07.800]  my understanding you know say 15 years ago in Brazil you wouldn't buy a house or build
[2:34:07.800 --> 2:34:11.680]  a house or an apartment complex or live in apartment complex if it didn't have a private
[2:34:11.680 --> 2:34:17.120]  gate a big wall around it you know electric fences like really high security level pretty
[2:34:17.120 --> 2:34:20.920]  much any city you go to in Brazil folks me you're gonna see walls fences electrified
[2:34:20.920 --> 2:34:26.120]  cameras everywhere because the crime was so bad and I hadn't really looked into the issue
[2:34:26.120 --> 2:34:30.440]  except other than just seeing Brazil coming back economically that usually means less
[2:34:30.440 --> 2:34:36.200]  crime and that's been the case so I mean outside of the favelas where obviously you know the
[2:34:36.200 --> 2:34:40.280]  drug wars are raging on and you know sometimes you might see military driving in there and
[2:34:40.280 --> 2:34:44.400]  you know it looks serious I mean other than that you're telling me the crime rate has
[2:34:44.400 --> 2:34:52.680]  gone down since Bolsonaro's gotten into yeah I have numbers here just to show you the number
[2:34:52.680 --> 2:35:05.920]  it was is Brazil's home side rate was 223.6 home sides for 100,000 inhabitants in 2020
[2:35:05.920 --> 2:35:17.800]  it used to be 30.8 so we went we went from 30.8 to 23.6 so this is Bolsonaro effect
[2:35:17.800 --> 2:35:25.480]  and the most important thing is Bolsonaro was not working together with the Congress
[2:35:25.480 --> 2:35:33.800]  to make easier to get out your your gun and your ammo and all that stuff he was not only
[2:35:33.800 --> 2:35:41.320]  doing it he was smashing all the journalists that was I mean talking bullshit about it let
[2:35:41.320 --> 2:35:46.520]  us say that clear you know because all the journalists and all these rich artists they
[2:35:46.520 --> 2:35:51.960]  say we need to ban all the guns and all the stuff but they have their own security right
[2:35:51.960 --> 2:35:58.080]  so Bolsonaro was Bolsonaro was unmasking it in front of everyone you know like saying
[2:35:58.080 --> 2:36:03.560]  that oh you we want to ban it but the problem is you have your own security what about the
[2:36:03.560 --> 2:36:10.280]  poor you know what about this poor cop in close favela or close close to the poor area
[2:36:10.280 --> 2:36:15.720]  in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and so forth so they do not have their own private security
[2:36:15.720 --> 2:36:22.880]  but you reach you have you know and he was changing people's mind because this is one
[2:36:22.880 --> 2:36:29.160]  thing that I see clearly in the whole world among anti-communists they think only passing
[2:36:29.160 --> 2:36:34.280]  bills and laws will change things you need to change people's mind first because that's
[2:36:34.280 --> 2:36:41.080]  the way the law and the bill will really pass through the Congress and make that that difference
[2:36:41.080 --> 2:36:46.080]  that we want so you need to change what people are believing you know and people are believing
[2:36:46.080 --> 2:36:52.760]  so many lies about it and it's hard for a person that never lived in a free country
[2:36:52.760 --> 2:36:59.560]  or in a free place believe that it's possible I don't know if you saw a funny video from
[2:36:59.560 --> 2:37:05.160]  that people made the Californians going to Texas and it's oh yeah look at that have you
[2:37:05.160 --> 2:37:09.160]  seen this video yeah but the Babylon be it's hilarious they freak out over a gun on the
[2:37:09.160 --> 2:37:15.160]  hip yeah so the so this is the situation for Brazilian people that never have been in a
[2:37:15.160 --> 2:37:20.720]  place with freedom where you can carry a gun in I mean that's it you are in a free free
[2:37:20.720 --> 2:37:27.120]  country in a free place so Bolsonaro was changing this myth that the media was creating and
[2:37:27.120 --> 2:37:33.120]  people's head you know and that was the greatest thing that he did another I mean that we now
[2:37:33.120 --> 2:37:40.120]  have our own right for association but we never had such a thing before so we were inspired
[2:37:40.120 --> 2:37:46.760]  by the Americans and doing great as you guys do you know with the association conservative
[2:37:46.760 --> 2:37:52.480]  movement institution all the stuff we are now is starting to have all of it and it's
[2:37:52.480 --> 2:38:00.080]  just the beginning you guys cannot stop oh and I bag all American citizen that are listening
[2:38:00.080 --> 2:38:07.080]  to me right now the only one republic that wasn't found with socialism agenda in its
[2:38:07.080 --> 2:38:13.640]  constitution was United States that's the only one republic that wasn't found by inspired
[2:38:13.640 --> 2:38:21.560]  by socialists even when John Adams went to French Revolution you know we he was in France
[2:38:21.560 --> 2:38:28.880]  and he when he came back he said that's not what we are doing here so you cannot compare
[2:38:28.880 --> 2:38:36.560]  the republic starting in France and republic that started in 1776 so the experience to
[2:38:36.560 --> 2:38:43.760]  have freedom like what you guys have here in America is inspiring the whole world but
[2:38:43.760 --> 2:38:52.520]  the problem is if these republic falls if these republic dies I dare to say it will
[2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:59.720]  it will be very very hard to build freedom outside of here well the enemies that's why
[2:38:59.720 --> 2:39:04.840]  the globalists want to destroy the US because they know that yeah because imagine it how
[2:39:04.840 --> 2:39:14.720]  could we have a very realistic place to show you know like you are banning the guns we
[2:39:14.720 --> 2:39:20.160]  all we all know the experience of it it's really bad but let me show you a reality
[2:39:20.160 --> 2:39:27.880]  of place like taxes place like Florida you know and where you can go and buy your guns
[2:39:27.880 --> 2:39:33.360]  tell me about these reality because debating arguments could be easy to you know to say
[2:39:33.360 --> 2:39:39.320]  whatever you want but when you show the reality when you show the reality for this person look
[2:39:39.320 --> 2:39:46.720]  I am just safe because I could defend myself and that's the problem people are they have
[2:39:46.720 --> 2:39:52.760]  hard time to believe when they couldn't see the reality of it and Bolsonaro could say
[2:39:52.760 --> 2:39:59.240]  to everyone look at United States look at some states in America they are safe because
[2:39:59.240 --> 2:40:05.440]  they have guns and guns are not against the honest people it's just against the people
[2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:11.400]  that want to destroy your family it's quite simple and Bolsonaro is getting it and in
[2:40:11.400 --> 2:40:19.520]  just four years Bolsonaro went from thirty dot thirty point I think it's thirty point
[2:40:19.520 --> 2:40:29.520]  eight to twenty three point six millions people dying you know it's he saved a lot of people
[2:40:29.520 --> 2:40:38.280]  and what the communists call him genocide due to the all this this crazy covid stuff
[2:40:38.280 --> 2:40:43.720]  but they are the killers well that's amazing to hear because I remember my favorite gun
[2:40:43.720 --> 2:40:48.600]  it's a side by side double barrel shotgun and it's made in Brazil and I remember at the
[2:40:48.600 --> 2:40:53.360]  time I would joke with my Brazilian friends because it says made on Brazil on the gun
[2:40:53.360 --> 2:40:58.720]  I said hey look my gun is made in Brazil but you can't even have one so have the laws really
[2:40:58.720 --> 2:41:03.240]  changed I mean where are the laws I mean because it used to be no gun rights for Brazilian citizens
[2:41:03.240 --> 2:41:10.200]  I mean where is that situation now under Bolsonaro it is changing slowly the Supreme Court is
[2:41:10.200 --> 2:41:16.760]  trying to ban guns during the elections saying that they could have like kind of plot or
[2:41:16.760 --> 2:41:22.920]  something like that we know they want to take these rights away but Bolsonaro is getting
[2:41:22.920 --> 2:41:30.440]  it through the Congress so this is this is the funny thing Bolsonaro is a dictator can
[2:41:30.440 --> 2:41:37.240]  a dictator change things in the country through the Congress you know it's it's so ridiculous
[2:41:37.240 --> 2:41:42.880]  their arguments are so ridiculous in other words in other words liberals in Brazil lie
[2:41:42.880 --> 2:41:49.920]  just like liberals in America oh yeah definitely definitely yeah and and this is this is the
[2:41:49.920 --> 2:41:58.200]  point here you cannot say that Bolsonaro is a dictator because he's doing everything
[2:41:58.200 --> 2:42:05.600]  through the Congress okay but the the Supreme Court the judicial power it's not doing their
[2:42:05.600 --> 2:42:12.680]  job they want to do all their power's job you know they want to legislate they want to
[2:42:12.680 --> 2:42:23.800]  executive power Bolsonaro is not doing it so how can a dictator do its his own job and
[2:42:23.800 --> 2:42:30.600]  still become a dictator it's crazy have you seen the documentary that BBC made together
[2:42:30.600 --> 2:42:37.400]  with I think NPR in America talking about the Amazon is on fire yeah that's their big
[2:42:37.400 --> 2:42:42.360]  global warming climate change bull crap let's talk about that on the other side one more

[2:45:13.040 --> 2:45:19.760]  as the bull and they are shaky a red flag in our face and the matador is the deep state
[2:45:19.760 --> 2:45:26.480]  with a long skinny razor sharp sword so that when the bull lunges forward the matador uses
[2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:31.560]  the force of its weight to drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape as the
[2:45:31.560 --> 2:45:36.240]  bull buries himself into the dust they've got the ace of spades in their hand which
[2:45:36.240 --> 2:45:41.040]  is false flags before you launch a war you stage false flags that's the first thing you

[2:48:17.480 --> 2:48:24.080]  we go the communists answered him again man I'll tell you they're everywhere so the I'm
[2:48:24.080 --> 2:48:32.680]  getting back slowly little by little since the supreme court of one to me arrested and
[2:48:32.680 --> 2:48:37.120]  deported by the United States I lost all my money in brazil I need to be there everything
[2:48:37.120 --> 2:48:44.000]  here where I where I'm free due to the US constitution a US flag and all the US soldiers
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:49.520]  that died for this freedom here so I'm free now I have my own website back it's their
[2:48:49.520 --> 2:48:56.560]  calibre dot com dot dot we are or you can find me on locals and also on a gather I'm
[2:48:56.560 --> 2:49:02.800]  building everything slowly but I would like to say something very important for everyone
[2:49:02.800 --> 2:49:11.360]  who is listening to us here on it people need to support info wars and alex jones a country
[2:49:11.360 --> 2:49:18.840]  that left behind their heroes their fighters cannot go longer this is very important because
[2:49:18.840 --> 2:49:26.080]  if I'm rebuting everything in my company it's because I have my own people on my back they
[2:49:26.080 --> 2:49:31.880]  are helping me and it's hard for them because they need to pay in dollar here in America
[2:49:31.880 --> 2:49:41.080]  to support me to make the show go on and it if you need to rebuild your country if you
[2:49:41.080 --> 2:49:48.240]  need to take your country back you cannot left anyone behind because that's the path
[2:49:48.240 --> 2:49:54.720]  to be destroyed and communists all of them they know if you scare someone you know if
[2:49:54.720 --> 2:50:01.960]  you arrest someone if you go after someone the truly friends will be filled they know
[2:50:01.960 --> 2:50:08.360]  that most of people will run away from you I pass it through it and I know the feeling
[2:50:08.360 --> 2:50:16.400]  and you cannot let alex jones an info wars be destroyed by these elites and all these
[2:50:16.400 --> 2:50:21.880]  globalists because they have all the money they want to do whatever they want they they
[2:50:21.880 --> 2:50:27.400]  have all the politicians they have all the drug cartels they have everything we just have
[2:50:27.400 --> 2:50:37.400]  you I just have you to help me to build my my company back and talk the truth to my audience
[2:50:37.400 --> 2:50:42.200]  info wars is the same thing that's the one thing that would like to say oh and we cannot
[2:50:42.200 --> 2:50:50.200]  left anyone behind well and you said it so well because that's what it really is it's
[2:50:50.200 --> 2:50:54.560]  the power structure it's the corrupt power structure trying to silence the voices that
[2:50:54.560 --> 2:50:58.880]  call it out and the voices that they view as a threat I mean that's so obvious that should
[2:50:58.880 --> 2:51:04.640]  be common sense sadly we've lost our fellow human liberals they they don't have common
[2:51:04.640 --> 2:51:08.840]  sense anymore it's it's it's a real sad thing or they've just totally abandoned it they've
[2:51:08.840 --> 2:51:13.240]  abandoned everything that's good and prosperous but you're absolutely right and you know I'm
[2:51:13.240 --> 2:51:17.880]  actually I mean I'm sure you feel the same way you know what it sucks that we have to
[2:51:17.880 --> 2:51:22.400]  battle harder to stay on air it sucks that we have to battle harder to fund what we do
[2:51:22.400 --> 2:51:27.560]  but at the end of the day I would much rather have to answer to this audience I would much
[2:51:27.560 --> 2:51:33.400]  rather have to answer to the people than some big giant corporation that pays me to say
[2:51:33.400 --> 2:51:37.880]  what it wants on air I I I would rather be attacked by the bad guys and be fighting the
[2:51:37.880 --> 2:51:44.000]  bad guys whatever the cost be then to be uplifted by the bad guys and and be rich and powerful
[2:51:44.000 --> 2:51:52.560]  and influential but sell my soul that's absolutely true and you know what people want that too
[2:51:52.560 --> 2:51:57.360]  they want real people they want real talk they do not want puppets anymore you know
[2:51:57.360 --> 2:52:03.240]  and this is why they will support terça livre Brazilian people are already doing it and
[2:52:03.240 --> 2:52:09.840]  this is why u.s. citizen will help infowars and Alex Jones and you are because we all
[2:52:09.840 --> 2:52:16.360]  will rebuild our countries by our hands and we're gonna do that we are not going to give
[2:52:16.360 --> 2:52:26.760]  up you know another great example of journalism a journalist being attacked is the great julien
[2:52:26.760 --> 2:52:34.800]  assange from wiki leaks it's amazing the persecution of julien assange spending a life basically
[2:52:34.800 --> 2:52:42.200]  in jail for exposing government corruption in the u.s. and it's the mexican president
[2:52:42.200 --> 2:52:47.200]  and it's mexico that has to say hey why are you doing this to julien assange julien assange
[2:52:47.200 --> 2:52:52.960]  should be viewed as a hero why are you trying to kill him julien assange wife actually put
[2:52:52.960 --> 2:52:58.440]  out a video today about this i may aired on the war room when do you think we cross the
[2:52:58.440 --> 2:53:05.400]  barrier and the threshold of people realizing hey it's the julien assange is of the world
[2:53:05.400 --> 2:53:09.160]  it's the alex jones is of the world it's the allen dos Santos of the world they're the
[2:53:09.160 --> 2:53:13.360]  ones being demonized by the very corrupt establishment we claim we're fighting maybe
[2:53:13.360 --> 2:53:22.640]  we should be listening to them the elite knows that once you find the truth nobody can convince
[2:53:22.640 --> 2:53:29.880]  you differently they know that once you have you know the reality as it is you will not
[2:53:29.880 --> 2:53:37.880]  fall into that traps and they just what what keep them all in that pedestal it's the the
[2:53:37.880 --> 2:53:43.600]  lies and the traps they made around them as a castle you know and when you destroy it
[2:53:43.600 --> 2:53:52.600]  all the bridge that keep all these lies holding up they will fall as a sand castle at once
[2:53:52.600 --> 2:54:03.240]  allen dos Santos again tell folks the website one more time it's terka livery.com.br or

[2:55:06.600 --> 2:55:14.320]  proven he's willing to stand against it as good as anyone and obviously allen understands
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:22.880]  the important of free speech as a brazilian citizen who has been excommunicated and censored
[2:55:22.880 --> 2:55:26.560]  and attacked and lied about in his own country for telling the truth about the government

[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:06.240]  put out are just a money-making deal most most people don't even write their own books
[2:57:06.240 --> 2:57:09.680]  they don't even know what's in it they just put their name on it sell a bunch of it and
[2:57:09.680 --> 2:57:15.520]  it's just it's just empty fluff not this book because people are actually getting this book
[2:57:15.520 --> 2:57:19.680]  and reading it and they're just their jaws are hitting the floor and they're at i mean
[2:57:19.680 --> 2:57:25.520]  i've never seen a book actually being ranted and raved about like this i mean seriously
[2:57:25.520 --> 2:57:29.080]  like my friends are texting me about it my family's texting me about it it's like hey

[3:00:14.160 --> 3:00:20.240]  kate dally radio dot com the kate dally show wow so glad to be with you today i don't really
[3:00:20.240 --> 3:00:24.840]  have great news to tell you the truth but i don't want this to be jump off a bridge radio
[3:00:24.840 --> 3:00:29.840]  either so um so you know informing is always good because then we can prepare and we know
[3:00:29.840 --> 3:00:36.240]  what's coming and it's really really important will you be flying in five years will you
[3:00:36.240 --> 3:00:45.960]  be flying in 25 in three years less than three years couple weeks will you fly less
[3:00:45.960 --> 3:00:50.520]  well what is their real five year plan look like and what does it look like for us to
[3:00:50.520 --> 3:00:59.920]  peons the the lowly citizens of this nation it's a really interesting part of the propaganda
[3:00:59.920 --> 3:01:04.680]  that we're in the propaganda overload because we're seeing a lot of headlines and i don't
[3:01:04.680 --> 3:01:09.760]  know if you weren't if we aren't paying attention we probably wouldn't see the effect of this
[3:01:09.760 --> 3:01:15.360]  that it's having on us but we're getting a constant influx of a gazillion i love that
[3:01:15.360 --> 3:01:22.440]  word gazillion headlines talking about this i'll kind of give you an example airplanes
[3:01:22.440 --> 3:01:28.240]  are incredibly polluting but could we ever live completely without them yes says the
[3:01:28.240 --> 3:01:34.560]  article yes we can it's very very interesting what would a flying free world look like
[3:01:34.560 --> 3:01:44.240]  says the bbc five reasons why flying won't be fun in the future see no fun terrible now
[3:01:44.240 --> 3:01:48.840]  it is terrible we have to squish and see it's made for small asians no offense asians you're
[3:01:48.840 --> 3:01:53.400]  just smaller people than most americans and it's really rough to tell you the truth it's
[3:01:53.400 --> 3:01:57.720]  hard to fly do you guys remember back i don't because i wasn't alive at the time but i do
[3:01:57.720 --> 3:02:01.400]  recall hearing about the fact that we used to fly we used to dress up and it used to
[3:02:01.400 --> 3:02:05.680]  be kind of a fun thing where we were comfortable the entire way pretty much sitting in first
[3:02:05.680 --> 3:02:10.960]  class even though you bought a you know back of the bus ticket not so much anymore they're
[3:02:10.960 --> 3:02:16.040]  making it very uncomfortable here's another one five ways flying could change in the future
[3:02:16.040 --> 3:02:23.680]  hmm really why should it change in the future what's wrong with it is anyone asking that
[3:02:23.680 --> 3:02:29.800]  will i ever be able to fly again without feeling guilty bbc i i don't feel guilty when i fly
[3:02:29.800 --> 3:02:34.000]  i pay a lot of money then i have to pay for a bag and then i have to pay for a tissue
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:39.480]  and i have to pay for chips and i got to pay for a drink what am i feeling guilty about
[3:02:39.480 --> 3:02:45.480]  oh mother earth that's why i'm feeling guilty the whole carbon footprint of 2.5 percent
[3:02:45.480 --> 3:02:55.320]  2.5 2.5 percent here's an opinion from the washington post for the love of earth you
[3:02:55.320 --> 3:03:02.240]  know mother earth needs to have her worship ceremony stop traveling stop traveling we
[3:03:02.240 --> 3:03:08.560]  all travel that's the fun that's i look forward to vacations don't you some require traveling
[3:03:08.560 --> 3:03:13.480]  will i ever be able to fly again without feeling guilty just cracks me up because i really
[3:03:13.480 --> 3:03:21.080]  don't will ordinary people be able to fly you and me will we have supersonic jets that
[3:03:21.080 --> 3:03:26.720]  are able to go around the world in no time for the elite but us little people us littles
[3:03:26.720 --> 3:03:36.400]  um can't go are we going to be outpriced are the flights unreliable right now are there
[3:03:36.400 --> 3:03:43.560]  really staff shortages has anyone asked that maybe it's not a staff shortage i'm sure the
[3:03:43.560 --> 3:03:48.640]  shots done it's damage and i'm sure they really wanted to make the airline industry take that
[3:03:48.640 --> 3:03:54.280]  shot maybe it was for a reason you have less pilots you have less staff maybe there's partial
[3:03:54.280 --> 3:03:59.360]  that could be a partial reason but maybe the big overall reason that started in 2020 because
[3:03:59.360 --> 3:04:06.400]  these articles started in 2020 not just this year so how would they have known how would
[3:04:06.400 --> 3:04:13.640]  they have known that flying was going to become an issue and a problem i don't know and as
[3:04:13.640 --> 3:04:18.600]  we're outpriced and as it's unreliable and as you can't count on your connecting flight
[3:04:18.600 --> 3:04:26.160]  which seems to be happening a lot as it's expensive will you be priced out the government
[3:04:26.160 --> 3:04:33.760]  took control of the airlines with a huge bailout and nobody was noticing in march of 2020 i
[3:04:33.760 --> 3:04:38.040]  guess there was a grand old reason that that happened more so than we think because the
[3:04:38.040 --> 3:04:44.480]  government has control over what they do but nobody was looking so i'm going to come right
[3:04:44.480 --> 3:04:48.520]  back there's a couple other things on the horizon you need to know about in their real
[3:04:48.520 --> 3:05:12.240]  five-year plan that they have for us and how we can fight it i'll be right back on k-dollars
[3:05:12.240 --> 3:05:29.820]  right now
[3:05:29.820 --> 3:05:34.140]  for about 50% more per pound. And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find
[3:05:34.140 --> 3:05:39.660]  anywhere. It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally. In fact, I'm not
[3:05:39.660 --> 3:05:47.020]  going to tell you a little story. We had like that. You wouldn't believe it. Anyway, so it's
[3:05:47.020 --> 3:05:51.660]  infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation. And if you don't fund us and don't
[3:05:51.660 --> 3:06:04.380]  want to share, that's fine. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show in Cape Valley, your guest host.
[3:06:04.380 --> 3:06:08.780]  So will you be flying in five years? I think my friend Katie Hopkins has it right on this.
[3:06:09.340 --> 3:06:14.060]  I don't think we will be. And I think we need to prepare for a world in which we are told that we
[3:06:14.060 --> 3:06:18.620]  must save Mother Earth. I was looking out the window the other day and everything looks suspiciously
[3:06:18.620 --> 3:06:25.660]  same as it has my entire life. It's still not affected by that dire climate change where I'm
[3:06:25.660 --> 3:06:31.900]  supposed to die in a burning inferno or freeze up like a popsicle at the end of every 10 years of
[3:06:31.900 --> 3:06:40.060]  my life. Interesting. Anyway, so now again, it's still 10 years out. Our demise, that is. And so
[3:06:40.060 --> 3:06:45.740]  we must save Mother Earth by lowering the carbon footprint. Here's what's in the articles. A world
[3:06:45.740 --> 3:06:52.460]  of no flights. Could I sound like the movie guy? A world of no flights would present some serious
[3:06:52.460 --> 3:06:58.860]  logistical challenges that could also open up the door to huge changes to other low carbon forms of
[3:06:58.860 --> 3:07:07.180]  transport. Oh, honey, you get to ride the train. Lucky you, you Amtrak Dweller. Yeah. And so the
[3:07:07.180 --> 3:07:14.780]  train's fun. It's long, you know, that or a covered wagon, I guess, as they outcar us and outfly us.
[3:07:14.780 --> 3:07:19.340]  So we won't be able to do those two things. I'll get to that in just a moment. But it says
[3:07:19.340 --> 3:07:23.660]  demand management, essentially people flying less is the most effective way to reduce those
[3:07:23.660 --> 3:07:28.540]  emissions this decade, according to the recent report from Transport and Environment. Those
[3:07:28.540 --> 3:07:35.020]  lucky folks, the environmental group that is, weighed in and said that we don't have sustainable
[3:07:35.020 --> 3:07:42.460]  aviation fuels, really. And what we could do in the future with this is really save Mother Earth.
[3:07:42.460 --> 3:07:48.780]  If we save that whole whopping 2.5% of emissions tax. Now remember, emissions tax was a total fraud
[3:07:48.780 --> 3:07:54.460]  put on by one of the committee of 300, Harlan Cleveland, back in 1996, came up with the riveting
[3:07:54.460 --> 3:07:59.180]  idea that we could come up with this tax for emissions. Where are the money supposed to go?
[3:07:59.900 --> 3:08:03.580]  No one knows. That doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how you save the earth. It just matters
[3:08:03.580 --> 3:08:07.820]  that you take taxation for it. And we were the only country that bought into it. The other
[3:08:07.820 --> 3:08:14.860]  countries said no, they weren't that stupid. Us, we do it. Remember when President Wilson 100 years
[3:08:14.860 --> 3:08:21.820]  ago used to keep sheep on the White House lawn? And he was asked, why do you keep a flock of sheep
[3:08:21.820 --> 3:08:26.620]  on the White House lawn? And he said, because it reminds me of the American people. Charming.
[3:08:27.340 --> 3:08:32.620]  Anyway, so there was much more to COVID than we thought. And grounding all the flights on
[3:08:32.620 --> 3:08:39.340]  earth, they said right now, grounding all of them would put a 2.5%. So if you just kept jets in
[3:08:39.340 --> 3:08:45.260]  the air for the elite, you know, the same Hollywood and politicians that cry for Mother Earth, but
[3:08:45.260 --> 3:08:49.740]  drive around their big black SUV or fly their jet, you know, to the events,
[3:08:50.540 --> 3:08:57.180]  don't say anything. And so of course, then we're only saving about 1%. If we ground everybody,
[3:08:57.180 --> 3:09:04.540]  and we keep them flying, a whole whopping 1%. But that's what they I think plan to do. And I
[3:09:04.540 --> 3:09:09.180]  think she's right. She put out a great video on it. And I think we should be paying attention,
[3:09:09.180 --> 3:09:14.540]  because I've been seeing these signs too, very, very strange signs, unreliable. They keep saying
[3:09:14.540 --> 3:09:19.180]  how unreliable it is for no reason. People want to go back to work. So why aren't they hiring?
[3:09:19.740 --> 3:09:24.300]  Obviously, people want to take flights. What you need to do is book a flight and book a flight
[3:09:24.300 --> 3:09:30.300]  and book a flight and book a flight and make those flights as full as you possibly can all the time.
[3:09:30.300 --> 3:09:36.140]  Because where there is demand, it's going to look highly suspicious when they really try to knock
[3:09:36.140 --> 3:09:42.060]  the flights down in the coming years to keep us grounded as far as that goes. So
[3:09:44.140 --> 3:09:48.860]  we are in a situation where we have a couple of things happening with our utilities. We have a
[3:09:48.860 --> 3:09:54.940]  couple of things happening with cars. And so let me get to that, because it's kind of this overall
[3:09:54.940 --> 3:10:01.660]  five-year real plan. And it's good to know what they have planned, because they don't always win.
[3:10:02.220 --> 3:10:06.860]  And I like to think that if we could take off the cover of this once in a while and see it for
[3:10:06.860 --> 3:10:10.940]  what it really is and see what they're trying to do and how they've been doing this since 2020,
[3:10:10.940 --> 3:10:15.100]  maybe we could get a handle on this, know our enemy a little bit better and stop this.
[3:10:15.100 --> 3:10:22.860]  It's crazy, insane, insane, like a guardrail. I feel like we're cattle in the guardrail. We
[3:10:22.860 --> 3:10:27.900]  should all start moving together. They love to manage us. In fact, they even came out with
[3:10:27.900 --> 3:10:34.060]  articles saying, by the way, five top tips for handling flight cancellations like a pro. Honey,
[3:10:34.060 --> 3:10:39.580]  if you're feeling like you can't get on the next flight, we'll teach you to suck it up a little
[3:10:39.580 --> 3:10:47.580]  bit more and handle it like a pro. Thanks, mainstream media. You're awesome. Really appreciate that.
[3:10:48.780 --> 3:10:54.460]  So then they had articles that came out and it said trains, a sustainable futures on track.
[3:10:55.260 --> 3:11:02.940]  Trains. Wasn't that like 75 years ago? Didn't we take the train because we had no other
[3:11:02.940 --> 3:11:11.020]  alternative like flying? So now they're talking about sustainable future. Well, back when
[3:11:11.020 --> 3:11:15.900]  Build Back Worse came out, it was talking about all the funding. There was an entire section I
[3:11:15.900 --> 3:11:21.020]  noticed as I was reading through it that it was 66 at the very, very beginning and start,
[3:11:21.020 --> 3:11:25.820]  $66 billion to pump into Amtrak. Why would you be pumping more money into Amtrak?
[3:11:26.540 --> 3:11:31.100]  It's not like when I want to go to Florida, the first thing I'm thinking is, wow, can I take the
[3:11:31.100 --> 3:11:36.460]  train? Because I know those seven days will be extra special as I try to get there. No,
[3:11:36.460 --> 3:11:41.340]  we take a flight. We want to get there immediately, don't we? So it's not like everybody is pumping
[3:11:41.340 --> 3:11:47.740]  for Amtrak. So why are they putting all this money into Amtrak? And you notice that they just
[3:11:47.740 --> 3:11:54.780]  closed down some of the... I was going to call them flights, not so much. Some of the ground
[3:11:54.780 --> 3:12:01.660]  movement, we'll just call it that, ground movement because of the strike, right? And so we would
[3:12:01.660 --> 3:12:05.980]  know that shortages were coming. Boy, you can control a lot of things because mostly on trains,
[3:12:05.980 --> 3:12:10.780]  it's food and products and plastics and all kinds of things that get shipped around,
[3:12:11.340 --> 3:12:15.820]  not necessarily so much as people. I don't know, I kind of had this vision of the box car.
[3:12:15.820 --> 3:12:24.940]  Wow. Okay, so they're setting up trains with all of this money to be kind of the next
[3:12:24.940 --> 3:12:29.500]  bastion of hope for us and they're going to consistently call them sustainable. Just watch
[3:12:29.500 --> 3:12:34.700]  the news. They'll consistently refer to trains for the next couple of years as the best thing
[3:12:34.700 --> 3:12:40.220]  since sliced bread. You just didn't know it, okay? You just didn't know your family vacation was now
[3:12:40.220 --> 3:12:45.500]  going to take three weeks, right? Because you have to get there and you have to get back on a
[3:12:45.500 --> 3:12:53.820]  train. Hmm. Interesting. They also are setting up warm banks in Europe because they're expecting. So
[3:12:53.820 --> 3:13:01.100]  the average bill for utilities is about $2 to $250, right? $150 to $250. And now it's going to jump
[3:13:01.100 --> 3:13:06.460]  up to upwards of $350 a month and there's going to be a lot of people that can't afford that.
[3:13:07.340 --> 3:13:12.540]  So what's going to happen? Well, they're telling you to get nice and cuddly. You can go to the
[3:13:12.540 --> 3:13:18.060]  community center. You can go to a library. Haven't stepped foot in one of those for a long time,
[3:13:18.060 --> 3:13:24.220]  but you can go there to get warm. And then you can go home to your very cold house that you might
[3:13:24.220 --> 3:13:29.740]  not want to live in anymore because, you know, it's cold or it's too hot in the summer. But here's
[3:13:29.740 --> 3:13:35.740]  a nice little apartment for you in town. You know, it's closer to the warm bank as you're all sitting
[3:13:35.740 --> 3:13:43.420]  around in this little hovel trying to, you know, do this and kind of sit there and get warm together.
[3:13:43.420 --> 3:13:46.380]  Then you go out in the freezing cold. I'm sure it's going to do a lot of good.
[3:13:47.020 --> 3:13:51.180]  And what are they selling it as? That's the most important thing to always remember. What are
[3:13:51.180 --> 3:13:58.380]  they selling it as? They're selling it as, well, you all, terrific, sweet, good citizen, you good
[3:13:58.380 --> 3:14:04.940]  world citizen. A friend of mine was in California and the smart meter would not kick the house
[3:14:04.940 --> 3:14:09.180]  under 83 degrees. Well, it was a little bit hot, sweltering, in fact.
[3:14:11.420 --> 3:14:16.460]  You can't go below 83 degrees. Yeah, the air conditioner as soon as everybody left the home
[3:14:16.460 --> 3:14:22.700]  was so smart, in fact, that it basically shut itself off. And if you tried to mess with it,
[3:14:22.700 --> 3:14:26.300]  if you tried to turn it on, you know, say four or five o'clock in the afternoon,
[3:14:26.300 --> 3:14:34.700]  you couldn't. You couldn't get that thing down below 83. Are smart meters going to be an issue?
[3:14:35.260 --> 3:14:39.820]  You bet they are. I was warning about this six years ago. I know Alex was warning about this
[3:14:39.820 --> 3:14:45.420]  for years. And it's the truth. We are in a situation where we're putting them in control.
[3:14:45.420 --> 3:14:51.900]  Why? Because we love our technology. It's shiny and it's fun. No, it's not. It's going to absolutely
[3:14:51.900 --> 3:14:57.740]  control your utility. Look what's happening in Europe. In Europe, they have the Burlington
[3:14:57.740 --> 3:15:03.260]  City Council, England's biggest serving 1.14 million people. The latest to announce facilities
[3:15:03.260 --> 3:15:08.060]  such as churches, community centers and libraries will be available for people to stay warm during
[3:15:08.060 --> 3:15:12.700]  colder months. You didn't know you're going to be hanging out at the community center, did you?
[3:15:12.700 --> 3:15:19.340]  Yeah, as you're paying rent on that very expensive place that you own, you also get to go hang out
[3:15:19.340 --> 3:15:25.100]  at the community center or an old-fashioned library to get warm. And this is what their local
[3:15:25.100 --> 3:15:29.660]  democracy reporting service is telling you. I love how they step in the word democracy at every
[3:15:29.660 --> 3:15:34.700]  turn. It's fun. No, we're a republic. We're a republic over here. I am talking about Europe,
[3:15:34.700 --> 3:15:40.620]  though. They can refer to themselves as that. But the government has been urged to step in,
[3:15:40.620 --> 3:15:47.020]  of course, and help control this dilemma coming. It's going to get colder and it's going to get
[3:15:47.020 --> 3:15:51.020]  more burdensome to try to heat your place. Be right back on that all-exchange show.
[3:15:57.180 --> 3:16:03.500]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and
[3:16:03.500 --> 3:16:08.300]  chemicals added to the food. It's all come out. And they're doing that not because we're weak,
[3:16:08.300 --> 3:16:13.820]  but because we're made the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful. And the social
[3:16:13.820 --> 3:16:19.660]  engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows
[3:16:19.660 --> 3:16:28.380]  who first came up with the boy. Is it true? The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation
[3:16:28.380 --> 3:16:33.340]  was hopeless. They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their
[3:16:33.340 --> 3:16:40.300]  cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the
[3:16:40.300 --> 3:16:44.620]  God of this world who is a loser. And that's why it's so important that everybody keep
[3:16:44.620 --> 3:16:48.060]  M4 Wars in the air now more than ever. Because even if you don't believe in God,
[3:16:48.700 --> 3:16:53.660]  what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is a channel. And we are opposing the one
[3:16:53.660 --> 3:17:23.500]  world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[3:17:26.620 --> 3:17:32.460]  does outstanding things. This is the highest grade and it's not been pasteurized. It's not
[3:17:32.460 --> 3:17:38.620]  been boiled. So it has its original effects intact. Ladies and gentlemen, everybody should

[3:18:03.180 --> 3:18:08.140]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year. 30 different
[3:18:08.140 --> 3:18:13.500]  tax returns, 30 different answers. 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers. And almost all
[3:18:13.500 --> 3:18:18.860]  of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're
[3:18:18.860 --> 3:18:23.420]  part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this. So
[3:18:23.420 --> 3:18:27.820]  it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[3:18:28.620 --> 3:18:34.140]  to be able to do things tax wise. It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your money.

[3:20:00.860 --> 3:20:14.940]  New World Order, it's Alex Jones. Welcome back, you horrible little citizens of the world and
[3:20:14.940 --> 3:20:19.580]  domestic tourists. Back here with you on the Alex Jones show, I'm Kate Deli, your guest host.
[3:20:20.540 --> 3:20:25.900]  It sounds crazy, doesn't it? The whole good citizen thing. You know, everything's going to be done
[3:20:25.900 --> 3:20:31.740]  in the name of good citizenry. When I was talking about California, there were people that my friend
[3:20:31.740 --> 3:20:38.300]  knew that said, well, you know, we're doing our part. Remember the Walmart slogan? And of course,
[3:20:38.300 --> 3:20:45.820]  it was on everything in 2020 when all this came crashing down. We're all in this together. And
[3:20:45.820 --> 3:20:50.460]  I had a t-shirt made that said we're all buying in this together, into this together. We're all
[3:20:50.460 --> 3:20:56.060]  buying into this together. And we are, unless we say something, unless we do something. For some
[3:20:56.060 --> 3:21:00.380]  reason, we still have our heads down for the large part, hoping it'll change. It's not going to,
[3:21:00.380 --> 3:21:07.660]  unless we do something about this. So the Los Angeles Fire Department has deployed what it
[3:21:07.660 --> 3:21:17.580]  believes to be the first electric fire truck in North America. In fact, they brought the prototype
[3:21:17.580 --> 3:21:24.220]  around. It looks ridiculous. The Menlo Park Fire District. It's a pretty violent place in California,
[3:21:24.220 --> 3:21:29.260]  Menlo Park. Anyway, first interested in the truck and and aimed to secure the first order.
[3:21:29.900 --> 3:21:34.780]  They were the first to jump on board that puppy and say, yes, this is the way of the future.
[3:21:35.500 --> 3:21:43.260]  And of course, they came out, it starts about, it's almost a million dollars. And 1.2, I guess.
[3:21:43.260 --> 3:21:48.940]  And they recently received the truck. And so the City of Los Angeles Fire Chief,
[3:21:48.940 --> 3:21:57.420]  Kristen Crowley, who loves the future. And I mean, big heart emoji to the future for this y'all.
[3:21:57.420 --> 3:22:04.300]  This was the idiotic statement she made. It will reduce noise. And it will bring it basically
[3:22:04.300 --> 3:22:10.540]  to nothing in regards of diesel emissions. We'll actually create the space for our firefighters
[3:22:10.540 --> 3:22:16.780]  to be in a healthier environment around our fire engines. When was, I don't remember,
[3:22:16.780 --> 3:22:21.980]  I don't recall firemen being picked off by diesel emissions. Do you? I always thought it was the
[3:22:21.980 --> 3:22:28.620]  fires, you know, inhaling all the smoke. Strange. Yeah, I don't remember a single death attributed
[3:22:28.620 --> 3:22:35.100]  to diesel emissions. They spend most of their time waiting for a call. And then they get in
[3:22:35.100 --> 3:22:40.780]  the engine and they put their headphones on. Hmm. I don't remember. I don't remember them.
[3:22:40.780 --> 3:22:45.820]  Are they all cowering around the back of the engine to suck in all those emissions? I mean,
[3:22:45.820 --> 3:22:50.380]  how does that work exactly? How is it healthier? I guess you have to come up with reasons. When
[3:22:50.380 --> 3:22:56.300]  you want an electric fire truck really bad, that will give out after eight hours and need a diesel
[3:22:56.300 --> 3:23:04.380]  generator. The irony is just so thick, for sure, that you're in a situation where you go,
[3:23:04.380 --> 3:23:11.740]  yes, and it will reduce noise. Do you mean the noise we don't hear as the sirens are wailing?
[3:23:11.740 --> 3:23:17.580]  Is that, is that, is that the noise that we're not supposed to hear? I, and she kept calling it
[3:23:17.580 --> 3:23:25.660]  an engine. It's, it's a motor. It's not an engine has gas. Last time I checked. Anyway, super smart
[3:23:25.660 --> 3:23:33.020]  that Kristen. Anyway, um, so I didn't realize that the fire engines themselves were so loud and
[3:23:33.020 --> 3:23:37.420]  disturbing over the wailing that you get to hear at three, four or five o'clock in the morning in
[3:23:37.420 --> 3:23:43.980]  your city that wakes you up when it's five miles away. So that's fun. I like that. And just to know
[3:23:43.980 --> 3:23:50.060]  in my heart of hearts that it's quieter just makes me feel all giddy inside. And of course,
[3:23:51.180 --> 3:23:55.020]  she was right there to really talk about the health and how they're super giddy about this and
[3:23:55.020 --> 3:24:00.140]  they really want to embrace the future. And they're going to embrace it first in California.
[3:24:00.140 --> 3:24:05.180]  Yeah. So many things start in California and New York. What is it about those two places?
[3:24:05.820 --> 3:24:12.460]  Anyway, electric fire trucks and electric police cars. These are coming our way. Why?
[3:24:12.460 --> 3:24:19.180]  To save Mother Earth and the two reasons that she made up. Wider engines and that we had some
[3:24:19.180 --> 3:24:25.180]  dire problem with firemen just peeling off, you know, dying because of those nasty emissions.
[3:24:25.180 --> 3:24:31.340]  Not because of the smoke they inhale out of fire. Nope. Not the building exploding. No.
[3:24:31.900 --> 3:24:36.220]  No, none of those things. Just the diesel emissions. Oh, Kristin, you're making this
[3:24:36.220 --> 3:24:41.180]  place such a fun place to work, right? And a healthier place. You need a good old good
[3:24:41.180 --> 3:24:47.980]  citizen badge, good old global citizen badge for you. Anyway, so I also wanted to talk about,
[3:24:47.980 --> 3:24:51.980]  it's just crazy, right? I also wanted to talk about disability payments. This is another
[3:24:51.980 --> 3:24:55.340]  thing that's going to be happening. Now, they've been edging into it here in America. How have
[3:24:55.340 --> 3:25:00.140]  they been doing this? They've been doing it by the federal government giving these
[3:25:00.140 --> 3:25:05.660]  wink-wink grants for your utilities. Oh, you can't afford utilities? I know we're two and a half
[3:25:05.660 --> 3:25:12.700]  years past COVID, but here's, you know, some time on your bill or you can't afford it. Hey,
[3:25:12.700 --> 3:25:18.700]  here's a little stipend. Well, those are all forms of disability. And what it's going to amount to
[3:25:18.700 --> 3:25:22.620]  is more and more people are going to be put on disability. They're going to be living off the
[3:25:22.620 --> 3:25:29.020]  government in the form of disability. Because when you're when you're yang and you want to pass the
[3:25:29.740 --> 3:25:36.380]  universal payment that you can't because we're America, then what do you do? Well,
[3:25:36.380 --> 3:25:41.500]  you get it through in other ways, right? You really got to work hard to figure out how to
[3:25:41.500 --> 3:25:48.060]  manipulate it so that people don't recognize it like that. It's that. It's basically we're going
[3:25:48.060 --> 3:25:53.580]  to screw you so hard on your utilities. You're going to be so worried about how to pay your bills.
[3:25:53.580 --> 3:25:57.500]  We're going to come in and help you. There's your universal payment. That's how it works.
[3:25:58.460 --> 3:26:04.860]  It's insane. But they're doing it. Six million people are receiving a disability
[3:26:04.860 --> 3:26:10.620]  passed in Europe in London right now. Six million people in Europe. I'm sorry. And
[3:26:11.580 --> 3:26:17.580]  they're being paid this qualifying disability benefit, right? And here's the deal. With the
[3:26:17.580 --> 3:26:22.700]  shots and how it's compromising health. And as much as the mainstream media wants to be that
[3:26:22.700 --> 3:26:27.580]  stupid and not talk about all the sudden deaths because there is no such thing as sudden adult
[3:26:27.580 --> 3:26:33.500]  death syndrome, then are we going to have more and more on disability? You've got autoimmune
[3:26:33.500 --> 3:26:37.180]  going through the roof, cancer going through the roof, people that are going in for surgeries.
[3:26:37.180 --> 3:26:41.420]  Doctors are quietly asking them, hey, have you had the shot? Because if you have, I have to give you
[3:26:41.420 --> 3:26:48.700]  a whole bunch more meds for your blood to be able to coagulate. So we're having problems. So what
[3:26:48.700 --> 3:26:56.060]  should we do? Tell me the truth. Did you get the shot or not? We're having so many issues that I do
[3:26:56.060 --> 3:27:02.140]  foresee a lot more people on disability. It's the disability universal payment. That's what it is.
[3:27:02.140 --> 3:27:06.700]  And it'll be broadened and more people will receive it. And as you're receiving those good old
[3:27:06.700 --> 3:27:12.380]  government funds, you won't squawk as much when the utilities are sky high or you can't fly,
[3:27:12.380 --> 3:27:18.380]  or you're being outpriced of your car or gas. Are they going to make it so that when you're
[3:27:18.380 --> 3:27:23.020]  driving your car, you're going to have so many more tickets to pay, you know, of course, the
[3:27:23.020 --> 3:27:27.180]  budgets for the police departments, it was never supposed to work that way. But here we are. And
[3:27:27.180 --> 3:27:33.020]  of course, more insurance. Are they going to make that super expensive? The cars themselves,
[3:27:33.020 --> 3:27:39.260]  more expensive gas, more expensive, outpriced you out of a car? What screams independence?
[3:27:40.460 --> 3:27:45.820]  Cars, you can get in and drive them all over the place. You have freedom, right? And if you have
[3:27:45.820 --> 3:27:51.660]  a car under 1992, well, you have even more freedom because you don't have any mechanisms that the
[3:27:51.660 --> 3:27:57.660]  government control inside those cars. That's fantastic. But the problem is, is that will you
[3:27:57.660 --> 3:28:05.100]  be able to, as King Fraudelot puts in all of those and spends, you know, $900 million on EV
[3:28:05.100 --> 3:28:13.020]  chargers across the country? Spare me. What happens if you don't go get an electric car?
[3:28:14.380 --> 3:28:19.260]  Well, here's the deal. I don't think that's the issue. I don't think that's what they're actually
[3:28:19.260 --> 3:28:26.220]  trying to do. They're not trying to move you into an electric car at all. In fact, when I come back,
[3:28:26.220 --> 3:28:32.220]  I'll describe what I think. But it has nothing to do with trying to get you into an electric car,
[3:28:32.220 --> 3:28:36.940]  I'll tell you that much. And I think if you can peel off back the cover just a little bit,
[3:28:37.500 --> 3:28:41.900]  maybe we'll kind of see this big plan of theirs, their real five-year plan and how this thing
[3:28:41.900 --> 3:28:47.980]  operates. Because it isn't about putting your butt in an electric car that you can't afford,
[3:28:47.980 --> 3:28:52.380]  and that will run out. Okay. I don't think it's about that at all. We'll be right back on the
[3:28:52.380 --> 3:28:59.740]  Alex Jones Show. And Kate Dell, your guest. It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year,
[3:29:00.380 --> 3:29:05.180]  and I believe the most powerful, the man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt,
[3:29:06.620 --> 3:29:13.580]  citizen of a republic, the man in the arena. There's only 10,000 of this coin and it exists
[3:29:13.580 --> 3:29:20.140]  in the world. It will never be made again. It's not just an amazing historic coin. It funds the
[3:29:20.140 --> 3:29:25.180]  information war against the globalist. This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren.
[3:29:25.180 --> 3:29:31.260]  This is something you want to own. And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war

[3:30:00.300 --> 3:30:05.340]  a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire. Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these
[3:30:05.340 --> 3:30:10.060]  profiles. You see it every year. 30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different
[3:30:10.060 --> 3:30:15.660]  tax returns, 50 different answers, and almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big
[3:30:15.660 --> 3:30:20.060]  firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general
[3:30:20.060 --> 3:30:25.580]  public understanding this and knowing this. So it's a very important situation with inflation
[3:30:25.580 --> 3:30:31.580]  and all the things out there hurting everybody. To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and
[3:30:31.580 --> 3:30:35.820]  lawful that allows you to keep more of your money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great

[3:31:03.900 --> 3:31:08.700]  the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[3:31:08.700 --> 3:31:13.420]  above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee. And yeah, we buy it from
[3:31:13.420 --> 3:31:17.580]  the little farmers that the media calls communists, but really, they're just a commune. And whatever
[3:31:17.580 --> 3:31:21.420]  the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it. And the farmers don't let the Mexican
[3:31:21.420 --> 3:31:24.700]  government take over. So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for,
[3:31:24.700 --> 3:31:28.540]  what, 14 years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another
[3:31:28.540 --> 3:31:33.100]  name for about 50% more per pound. And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find
[3:31:33.100 --> 3:31:38.700]  anywhere. It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally. In fact, I'm not
[3:31:38.700 --> 3:31:45.900]  going to tell you a little story. We had one. Okay, you wouldn't believe it. Anyway, so it's
[3:31:45.900 --> 3:31:50.620]  infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation. And if you don't fund us and don't
[3:31:50.620 --> 3:31:51.580]  want to see it, that's fine.
[3:31:56.860 --> 3:32:01.740]  The best-selling book in America last week was The Great Reset and the War for the Worlds,
[3:32:01.740 --> 3:32:08.140]  written by Alex Jones. Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week. But the
[3:32:08.140 --> 3:32:11.260]  New York Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that. The
[3:32:11.260 --> 3:32:15.900]  New York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New York Times.
[3:32:15.900 --> 3:32:20.140]  The paper that started the Iraq War by lying about weapons mass destruction and got a million
[3:32:20.140 --> 3:32:25.340]  people killed. So they lied about his book. The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[3:32:25.340 --> 3:32:31.900]  the historic book that lays out the plans of the Great Reset Death Star and exposes
[3:32:31.900 --> 3:32:40.220]  the New World Order's plans for global enslavement. Get your copy now at amazon.com to keep the book

[3:32:57.580 --> 3:33:03.980]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:03.980 --> 3:33:17.740]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones show. I love it. You're a horrible citizen like me.
[3:33:17.740 --> 3:33:23.180]  My biggest goal in life is to become a horrible, horrible global citizen.
[3:33:23.900 --> 3:33:28.060]  May we all achieve that in our lifetime. That'll be something to be proud of. I like to put that
[3:33:28.060 --> 3:33:36.060]  on my obituary. It's the truth. Oh my gosh. So let's recap. Will we be flying in five years? I
[3:33:36.060 --> 3:33:42.780]  don't think we will be. I think the goal is to is to propagandize you so hard into thinking that
[3:33:42.780 --> 3:33:46.860]  flying's bad that if you fly, you will start to feel guilty because they're telling you to.
[3:33:47.500 --> 3:33:52.140]  And as you fly that uncomfortable flight next to the stranger as you're pretty much sitting
[3:33:52.140 --> 3:33:59.020]  in their lap the entire time, and it's that uncomfortable with a Stasi-like crew, it is
[3:33:59.020 --> 3:34:03.340]  going to get more uncomfortable, more expensive. They're going to out-price you and price you
[3:34:03.340 --> 3:34:09.020]  out of it, I should say. And we might not be flying. Take all the flights you can right now,
[3:34:09.020 --> 3:34:14.700]  but I would seriously bulk up the flights because it'll look insane when they try to
[3:34:14.700 --> 3:34:18.620]  shut that down with the demand being that high. Don't give in to all the propaganda and the
[3:34:18.620 --> 3:34:23.500]  headlines, right? I know I'm preaching to the choir. I know you guys know. It's just frustrating
[3:34:23.500 --> 3:34:26.780]  out there because there's so much propaganda. You don't realize all the headlines that have
[3:34:26.780 --> 3:34:32.140]  been coming out for three years on this topic, two and a half, almost three years. It's insane.
[3:34:32.940 --> 3:34:37.820]  So cars, what's the end game of cars? I don't think it is to put you into an electric car.
[3:34:37.820 --> 3:34:41.980]  They know that'd be impossible. People are not just going to give up their car to go into an
[3:34:41.980 --> 3:34:47.340]  electric car. Who would be that lame? Never mind. There's people in California that would be.
[3:34:47.340 --> 3:34:54.620]  I can say that because I was raised there. I was raised there. Anyway, so there will be
[3:34:54.620 --> 3:35:02.860]  those people that just absolutely want to drive those cars. The problem is, is that most of America
[3:35:02.860 --> 3:35:08.060]  isn't coming onto this little game. And I do think that it isn't about putting you into an electric
[3:35:08.060 --> 3:35:15.020]  car. It's about putting you in no car. It's about Agenda 2030. It's about the implementation of
[3:35:15.020 --> 3:35:22.460]  saying to you, oh yeah, we were wrong. Electric cars aren't going to work for the entire nation
[3:35:22.460 --> 3:35:30.140]  because those batteries are even more toxic. And now that you've done away with your car,
[3:35:30.140 --> 3:35:35.420]  if you have, or now that we've outpriced you, you can't drive your car because of insurance
[3:35:35.420 --> 3:35:40.860]  and tickets and registrations going up and the cost of fuel and everything else. And maybe
[3:35:40.860 --> 3:35:46.300]  those places don't even get fuel. Maybe the gas stations don't even get the fuel. And we have
[3:35:46.300 --> 3:35:51.420]  such shortages that people just finally go, okay, I don't know if I can drive. What am I going to do?
[3:35:51.420 --> 3:35:56.220]  Walk? This is why they've been implementing all of those bike trails in every single neighborhood.
[3:35:56.220 --> 3:36:01.340]  Every single neighborhood across the country, you've seen a rash of bike trails pop up. This is why.
[3:36:01.340 --> 3:36:07.420]  They want to make it so that you walk or bike and for Mother Earth. Just know that you are loving
[3:36:07.420 --> 3:36:12.780]  your Mother Earth when you're doing all that, okay? Because that's what they want you to think.
[3:36:12.780 --> 3:36:16.140]  They want you to think that you're doing something. And there are going to be a lot of people that
[3:36:16.140 --> 3:36:20.220]  say, we're just doing our part. And I'm going to pat myself on the back for being that good citizen
[3:36:20.220 --> 3:36:27.180]  that I am. But why are you sacrificing? What's the sacrifice for? Nothing. Didn't do anything,
[3:36:27.980 --> 3:36:32.300]  but you're going to sacrifice and you're going to be happy about it. It's a lot easier to control
[3:36:32.300 --> 3:36:36.940]  people when they voluntarily do something than trying to force them. And they figure out
[3:36:36.940 --> 3:36:41.500]  and they figured that out. Tavistock back in the day, and it's still running
[3:36:41.500 --> 3:36:46.060]  strong, figured that out that psychological operations on us would work a lot better than
[3:36:46.060 --> 3:36:51.100]  just trying to force us. Especially here in America, we're supposed to be a free country.
[3:36:51.100 --> 3:36:56.460]  How do you do that? Oh, you just put psychological warfare on just about everything. We are a
[3:36:56.460 --> 3:37:02.780]  product of psychological warfare. And so it won't be about putting you an electric car. That's
[3:37:02.780 --> 3:37:07.100]  their solution right now. Oh, we're going to move towards electric. No, it's going to be no car.
[3:37:08.140 --> 3:37:13.740]  And will people give up their homes and cars? Cars too expensive, homes too cold in the winter,
[3:37:13.740 --> 3:37:18.620]  too hot in the summer? Maybe. And go into that government-approved housing that they've been
[3:37:18.620 --> 3:37:26.860]  in a scramble to really get up in volumes, okay? And then also gardens. In 2009, they passed the
[3:37:26.860 --> 3:37:33.900]  People's Gardens and you were supposed to register with USDA. You didn't do that? I can't imagine.
[3:37:33.900 --> 3:37:40.380]  I'm in shock. Yeah, who would? I don't know. But anyway, there are people that would. And now
[3:37:40.380 --> 3:37:45.100]  they've made it a bigger, broader, expanded program because they'd like your little garden.
[3:37:45.100 --> 3:37:50.300]  Your little garden, you see, isn't just your garden anymore. It's the People's Garden. Your
[3:37:50.300 --> 3:37:55.340]  garden is my garden. No, I'm not out there watering. I'm not out there paying for fertilizer or seeds
[3:37:55.340 --> 3:38:02.860]  or anything. But it's my fruit too. And so I get a claim. It's all fun. And so they're really
[3:38:02.860 --> 3:38:09.900]  expanding that program and the USDA, they want, they want to see that happen. Also, I was looking
[3:38:09.900 --> 3:38:16.460]  at an article the other day that said this invisible army, this invisible army of abortion
[3:38:16.460 --> 3:38:21.100]  murders will affect election results. They're going to come out in election time and they're
[3:38:21.100 --> 3:38:27.420]  going to affect election results. And it reminded me of the invisible army of
[3:38:27.420 --> 3:38:34.460]  Tavistock to tell you the truth because why are we in this pickle? Well, there's two reasons.
[3:38:34.460 --> 3:38:42.140]  Actually three. One is a product of one of them. Club of Rome and the Committee of 300 kind of
[3:38:42.140 --> 3:38:48.620]  run things behind when we say they were always talking about them. And the vehicle that they
[3:38:48.620 --> 3:38:55.580]  used to do that would be Tavistock. Tavistock used to be Wellington. It used to be a psychological
[3:38:55.580 --> 3:39:00.940]  warfare. The first real good project they had was to try to entice us into World War One.
[3:39:01.740 --> 3:39:09.820]  And so what they, what they started doing was they started demonizing the guy, what was his name,
[3:39:09.820 --> 3:39:15.340]  Halsey, the guy that ran Germany. And they started saying all these things about him in the press.
[3:39:15.340 --> 3:39:19.980]  They started saying that the Germans were throwing up babies and they were landing on bayonets.
[3:39:20.940 --> 3:39:29.020]  That sounds familiar. I remember hearing that about Iraq. Interesting. Anyway, and so they kept
[3:39:29.020 --> 3:39:36.700]  demonizing him, demonizing him, demonizing him. And to the point where they were saying so many
[3:39:36.700 --> 3:39:44.540]  things about it to try to rile up our interest in World War One. Eddie Bernays was in Wellington
[3:39:44.540 --> 3:39:49.660]  and then turned into Tavistock. And so many people, oh my gosh, there's so many people in this,
[3:39:50.380 --> 3:39:58.140]  Russian spy that George Orwell actually looked up to and wrote most of his stuff from this
[3:39:58.140 --> 3:40:05.020]  Russian spy. And so there were all kinds of people, this brain trust, this Tavistock brain
[3:40:05.020 --> 3:40:09.980]  trust. It says it didn't start till 1946, but that's just when it changed the names and changed
[3:40:09.980 --> 3:40:15.660]  hands. And they have been on a clear assault against us ever since. So when I've said on this show
[3:40:15.660 --> 3:40:23.660]  before, did the Nazi eugenics ever end? Not really. No. The programs kept going and they were really
[3:40:23.660 --> 3:40:28.940]  against us. They got their two wars right after the Federal Reserve got shoved through. They waited
[3:40:28.940 --> 3:40:32.540]  for the Federal Reserve. You got to have the Federal Reserve in control of the money before
[3:40:32.540 --> 3:40:39.900]  you profit off the wars. That's how that worked. And so the Tavistock works for the Club of
[3:40:39.900 --> 3:40:44.460]  Rome and it works for the CFR and it works for Trilateral Commission. Remember Kissinger kissing
[3:40:44.460 --> 3:40:50.860]  up to China in the 70s. The German Marshall Fund, you name it. I mean, talk about every
[3:40:50.860 --> 3:40:57.100]  single group, the Bank of International Settlements. And so you have all of these groups that were
[3:40:57.100 --> 3:41:04.540]  steadily feeding us propaganda, opinion, opinion polls were a big deal. That changed a lot because
[3:41:04.540 --> 3:41:09.980]  they were able to say 90% of Americans feel this way. They'd like to kick their puppy. And then
[3:41:09.980 --> 3:41:14.700]  you're like, I don't like to kick my puppy. Should I like to kick my puppy? Do 90% of other Americans
[3:41:14.700 --> 3:41:20.140]  think that? Oh, maybe I should change my views. Maybe I want to kick a puppy. That's how that works.
[3:41:21.180 --> 3:41:28.060]  So the opinion polls came out and started shaping how we viewed things and how we saw things.
[3:41:28.060 --> 3:41:35.660]  But I thought it was interesting in that script of how they demonized and demonized and demonized.
[3:41:35.660 --> 3:41:40.060]  Even to this day, you still might look back in history and go, well, that guy was evil.
[3:41:40.060 --> 3:41:46.380]  I'm not talking about Hitler, the guy before Hitler. Was he? Should you question that?
[3:41:48.620 --> 3:41:55.100]  I mean, we were told ISIS was going to come get us. We were told the Taliban was going to come get
[3:41:55.100 --> 3:42:02.140]  us. We were told a lot of things. Shouldn't you invest maybe a little bit of time in figuring
[3:42:02.140 --> 3:42:07.820]  out if that actually happened? They got us into a war with Germany, and we were very,
[3:42:07.820 --> 3:42:15.500]  very reluctant to do so for good reasons. George Washington warned, do not, do not become
[3:42:16.220 --> 3:42:23.180]  that entity that goes around creating war. But they were smart enough to know that
[3:42:23.180 --> 3:42:28.620]  we couldn't make the first move because we would never be behind that. The move always had to be
[3:42:28.620 --> 3:42:34.220]  made, and then we were going to rush in to save the day. That's how it works. And I'll come right
[3:42:34.220 --> 3:42:38.780]  back and I'll talk about that because this is really interesting. The script hasn't changed.
[3:42:40.140 --> 3:42:47.260]  We, the people, just failed to see it over and over and over again. We're consistently manipulated
[3:42:47.260 --> 3:42:54.620]  to the core. Be right back on the Alex Jones show and Kate Dahlier against us.
[3:42:55.980 --> 3:43:03.900]  The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass and
[3:43:03.900 --> 3:43:10.380]  so many other ingredients that are known to make us healthy, to make us vibrant, and to defend our
[3:43:10.380 --> 3:43:15.740]  immune systems. Now over a year and a half ago, we came out with a product that was top sourced,
[3:43:15.740 --> 3:43:20.860]  topped the line as good as it's going to get, but then the supply chain broke down and it was sold
[3:43:20.860 --> 3:43:26.620]  out for more than a year. Finally, green fiber capsules, this big old bottle, jam packed,

[3:45:05.020 --> 3:45:14.380]  one is better? And that's like asking, what's better, a Ford F-150 or a Cadillac or a Ferrari?
[3:45:15.260 --> 3:45:19.980]  It's different strokes for different folks. It varies, all three are different formulas,

[3:46:54.300 --> 3:47:03.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:11.740 --> 3:47:16.300]  Welcome back on The Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Dahle, your guest host from KateDahleradio.com.
[3:47:17.020 --> 3:47:23.340]  And let me start here because I always like a little bit of history in the news,
[3:47:23.340 --> 3:47:28.620]  because everything is better in context and understanding. Otherwise, we can't see how
[3:47:28.620 --> 3:47:33.100]  we got here and we can't see the script being played out again and again. That's frustrating at
[3:47:33.100 --> 3:47:40.300]  best for people not to be able to see that and we clearly have a good old vision problem in America
[3:47:40.300 --> 3:47:45.420]  of not being able to see the clear lines of manipulation because they're happening again
[3:47:45.420 --> 3:47:52.460]  and again. Let me give you some examples. So it was Kaiser Wilhelm that was in the press
[3:47:52.460 --> 3:47:57.500]  consistently. We did cartoons about him and we told everybody who's doing these super outlandish
[3:47:58.220 --> 3:48:05.820]  violent things. Was he? They also said the German army was taking Belgian kids and they
[3:48:05.820 --> 3:48:10.140]  were chopping off their hands and they were raping all the women. And those accounts,
[3:48:10.140 --> 3:48:15.100]  they got this guy that was really respected over in Europe, Viscount Bryce. And they said,
[3:48:15.100 --> 3:48:18.940]  you go and do an investigation. Everybody will trust you because for a short time he was the
[3:48:18.940 --> 3:48:25.420]  ambassador to here, to the USA. And so he goes and he doesn't investigate anything. He doesn't
[3:48:25.420 --> 3:48:31.020]  name anybody. He doesn't really look at anything. He's just told to pass this off because as soon
[3:48:31.020 --> 3:48:38.220]  as he passed all that off his truth, we were at war. We were at war and it was going to happen.
[3:48:39.100 --> 3:48:45.100]  That's exactly what they wanted. And so we have this problem of propaganda every single time
[3:48:45.100 --> 3:48:51.580]  that we go into battle, every single time we go into a war, it's always the same story.
[3:48:52.300 --> 3:48:58.540]  All of a sudden that dictator of that country turns into a monster overnight and he's gassing
[3:48:58.540 --> 3:49:05.180]  and killing his people and we must save them. Think about it. It's there's never any other story.
[3:49:06.540 --> 3:49:12.620]  Boy, that's a lot of like instant madmen. How does that happen? Just instant.
[3:49:12.620 --> 3:49:18.540]  What are the odds of that? Every single time and we've been in war consistently since we
[3:49:18.540 --> 3:49:24.300]  formed the UN for peace. We've been in war, military action, not declared war by Congress as
[3:49:24.300 --> 3:49:32.220]  it should be. But isn't that interesting? So if you go back into time just a little bit,
[3:49:32.220 --> 3:49:38.780]  we were told Assad of Syria was suddenly the same thing overnight a madman we must go and save
[3:49:38.780 --> 3:49:44.300]  the people. The white helmets were actually the bad guys in that. Osama bin Laden, we were
[3:49:44.300 --> 3:49:49.660]  told the same thing. Obviously he was CIA and obviously he was friendly with the bushes and
[3:49:49.660 --> 3:49:54.220]  everything else and then all of a sudden he was this madman who sent a bunch of people flying
[3:49:54.220 --> 3:50:02.060]  into the towers. And then of course Saddam was throwing babies on the bayonets and gassing curds.
[3:50:02.940 --> 3:50:06.300]  Do you know they actually went and did an investigation on that and that actually didn't
[3:50:06.300 --> 3:50:13.980]  happen. It was actually Iranian gas that was dropped. He wasn't gassing the curds. The curds
[3:50:13.980 --> 3:50:18.700]  actually were moving into the northern territories of Iraq trying to take the land and call it their
[3:50:18.700 --> 3:50:23.740]  own. So of course he was going into battle with them but he wasn't gassing them as everybody was
[3:50:23.740 --> 3:50:29.180]  told. That was a lie. And when the truth came out nobody cared. Absolutely nobody cared about the
[3:50:29.180 --> 3:50:32.940]  truth because the lies are already been told. The lies were there. The Clintons used the same lies
[3:50:32.940 --> 3:50:38.460]  about Serbia. We're told the same thing about Ukraine right now and Russia, of course Russia,
[3:50:39.020 --> 3:50:45.740]  and they're still trying to sell that. And I heard even like last night it was a story,
[3:50:45.740 --> 3:50:51.580]  oh my gosh, Russia is losing. I wouldn't trust one thing that they say about what's going on over
[3:50:51.580 --> 3:50:59.260]  there. Not one thing ever because all they've done is lie to us for over 100 years. So every
[3:50:59.260 --> 3:51:04.540]  single country that we've had a military action with there's not one normal president of any of
[3:51:04.540 --> 3:51:11.100]  those countries. See you can't go to war with somebody normal. You can only go to war on a madman
[3:51:11.100 --> 3:51:16.780]  that's killing his people because how do you get the American people to do that? Well because we
[3:51:16.780 --> 3:51:23.020]  feel sorry for the people that are, they say are being abused so we rush in. This is taken from the
[3:51:23.020 --> 3:51:28.060]  British military handbook. Demonize and take control of the enemy through public perception
[3:51:28.060 --> 3:51:37.260]  and other tactics. Yeah. Tavistock also wrote the CIA manual on guerrilla warfare. The World War II
[3:51:37.260 --> 3:51:42.460]  program of buying Liberty Bonds was written by Tavistock. It was directed by London. Who funded
[3:51:42.460 --> 3:51:49.740]  Tavistock? Oh, the royal family. You know how everyone, five billion people were watching the
[3:51:49.740 --> 3:51:55.500]  funeral of Elizabeth and really getting into the pomp and circumstance of this? Isn't it interesting
[3:51:55.500 --> 3:52:02.300]  that they were behind funding this mass propaganda effort along with the Rothschilds and along with
[3:52:02.300 --> 3:52:08.860]  the Rockefellers? So Tavistock even came up with the name isolationist. Remember they used to call
[3:52:08.860 --> 3:52:15.660]  Ron Paul an isolationist? Ron Paul is a fantastic student of the Constitution. One of the best
[3:52:15.660 --> 3:52:22.220]  people to interview ever. And they had that negative term spun out because in World War I
[3:52:22.220 --> 3:52:28.540]  if you were not all for going in on the pretenses that they handed you, then you were an isolationist
[3:52:28.540 --> 3:52:34.380]  and that was supposed to be a big boogeyman word. You're an isolationist. Oh, how terrible.
[3:52:35.580 --> 3:52:40.460]  Anyway, why was Switzerland never bombed? Why were our offices in Germany never bombed?
[3:52:40.460 --> 3:52:47.020]  Why were munitions never bombed? Oh, the profiteering of munitions. Yeah, that's why.
[3:52:47.020 --> 3:52:53.820]  And of course, Voice of America that all started with a bill and that gave the Smith
[3:52:53.820 --> 3:53:02.220]  Mundt Act gave them the ability to lie out there, to absolutely just lie. And so we get to 1991,
[3:53:02.220 --> 3:53:08.220]  16-year-old daughter of Kuwait ambassador. Funny how nobody recognized her. Anyway,
[3:53:08.860 --> 3:53:13.580]  sold the lies about babies being thrown to the ground and stomped on. Desert storm was suddenly
[3:53:13.580 --> 3:53:19.820]  a war. Never proclaimed this military action, right? Really. I mean, go, right? And just like
[3:53:20.540 --> 3:53:27.020]  President Wilson sent our troops over to France to meet their death, we basically said that Saddam
[3:53:27.020 --> 3:53:31.900]  had to be removed to make the Middle East safe again. Is it, do you feel safe? I don't feel safe.
[3:53:32.620 --> 3:53:37.740]  I don't feel safe from my government. That's what I don't feel safe from. And of course,
[3:53:37.740 --> 3:53:46.220]  that 16-year-old, did they pay Hilton and Knowles $600,000 for that stunt in front of our Senate?
[3:53:46.220 --> 3:53:51.340]  Because it was a lie. It was a lie. And neither one of them were ever punished for that lie.
[3:53:51.340 --> 3:53:56.140]  But isn't it interesting that they never, ever changed the script? They couldn't,
[3:53:56.140 --> 3:54:00.460]  were so dumb that they couldn't, they didn't even have to change the script. We would just
[3:54:00.460 --> 3:54:04.700]  believe it. Because who's going to believe or who's going to go back in the time and
[3:54:04.700 --> 3:54:10.860]  look at World War I? Nobody. Nobody, right? By that time, everyone's in nursing homes,
[3:54:10.860 --> 3:54:16.300]  really, right? That would remember that. Unless you were a kid and you had an expert memory.
[3:54:17.580 --> 3:54:22.780]  And here we are. We had League of Nations, United Nations, but we never, ever had,
[3:54:23.500 --> 3:54:31.020]  we never had anything, never a different script. It was always the same. And I marvel at that,
[3:54:31.020 --> 3:54:38.460]  that we absolutely are okay with that. Somehow, some way, we don't see the parallel
[3:54:38.460 --> 3:54:46.220]  and the shocking, just the mimicking of every single event. Suddenly a madman. We must go in.
[3:54:47.340 --> 3:54:54.940]  When are we ever going to wake up? Tavistock works for the Black nobility. And so, yeah,
[3:54:54.940 --> 3:55:00.700]  no one ever talks about them. Do they? And this is how they got to COVID. And this is why I think
[3:55:00.700 --> 3:55:05.820]  things are happening a little faster now. They realized with COVID that with no cemeteries,
[3:55:05.820 --> 3:55:11.260]  no actual evidence of any pandemic, no one dying in the streets randomly, no evidence that masks
[3:55:11.260 --> 3:55:16.380]  worked, the only solution from day one was only going to be a vaccine and nothing else. No medication.
[3:55:16.380 --> 3:55:21.100]  Oh, no, just a vaccine. And that that vaccine was already in production first week of February,
[3:55:21.740 --> 3:55:27.580]  before they even named COVID. 98 symptoms encompassing just about every single illness on
[3:55:27.580 --> 3:55:34.300]  the block, right? And they knew, they knew they could still get away with some of the
[3:55:34.300 --> 3:55:39.340]  biggest lies. I think we have bigger lies coming. And I think climate change is going to be
[3:55:39.340 --> 3:55:45.900]  the lack of vehicles, the fight for utilities, the fight for just being able to afford a grocery
[3:55:45.900 --> 3:55:55.020]  store run, all manufactured from the top, all manufactured from the top. What are we going
[3:55:55.020 --> 3:56:01.980]  to do? If you can get more people to see this, more people to see this, wouldn't it be interesting
[3:56:01.980 --> 3:56:08.140]  if they stopped wearing the mask? And I mean metaphorically in everything, if they stopped
[3:56:08.140 --> 3:56:15.500]  getting emotionally manipulated by everything. If they just stopped and they looked at the big
[3:56:15.500 --> 3:56:22.700]  picture and peeled back that outer layer to see that this is all contrived. All the things that
[3:56:22.700 --> 3:56:31.580]  we deal with now, the music, the abortion, the changing in the pronoun, crazy that everything,
[3:56:31.580 --> 3:56:40.940]  every movement was brought on by by by Tabistock manipulation that also Stanford Hoover Institute,
[3:56:41.580 --> 3:56:47.180]  you name it, Wharton, all kinds of things stem out of Tabistock, but they're very, very good
[3:56:47.180 --> 3:56:52.540]  at what they do for a reason. They've perfected it and they know exactly what pushes our buttons
[3:56:52.540 --> 3:56:57.260]  again and again. And they're just hoping and crossing their fingers that we won't figure it out.
[3:56:57.260 --> 3:57:01.100]  They do have weaknesses. They don't want us to look at fusion. They don't want us to see
[3:57:01.100 --> 3:57:07.340]  nuclear power as a plus. They demonize that. They demonize everything that they want you to feel
[3:57:07.340 --> 3:57:13.340]  is bad, right? They want you to think is bad. And they prop up all the stuff that actually
[3:57:13.340 --> 3:57:18.140]  helps us with our liberty. They demonize those things and tell you they're no good.
[3:57:19.100 --> 3:57:23.340]  Man, we really have to wake up and I hate saying that because I hate that phrase. It's getting
[3:57:23.340 --> 3:57:30.620]  old. Wake up, wake up, but we are asleep at the wheel and the flying and the cars and the electricity,
[3:57:30.620 --> 3:57:35.180]  all these things are happening and we better wake up to it. We better see it going on right now.
[3:57:35.180 --> 3:57:39.740]  We're not going to stop it. I'm Kate Daly, your guest host for the Alex Jones Show today. It's
[3:57:39.740 --> 3:57:45.180]  been a pleasure. Glad you joined me. Thank you.
[3:57:46.220 --> 3:57:52.540]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system,
[3:57:52.540 --> 3:57:58.540]  for your brain, for every part of your body. But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that
[3:57:58.540 --> 3:58:06.380]  it has natural psychotropic effects. It certainly does for me. When I take a couple of these capsules
[3:58:06.380 --> 3:58:12.220]  an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing. Now there are actually some studies
[3:58:12.220 --> 3:58:19.580]  out there linking it to amazing events in the brain, but I want you to experience it yourself.
[3:58:19.580 --> 3:58:23.100]  We know it's good for your heart. We know it's good for your brain. We know it's good for your
[3:58:23.100 --> 3:58:28.620]  arteries and veins and your lungs and every other function in your body. But I want you to experience
[3:58:28.620 --> 3:58:33.740]  this high grade fish oil, this ultimate fish oil at mformershore.com and see what it does
[3:58:33.740 --> 3:58:40.060]  if you take it before bedtime. Ultimate fish oil, 50% off, now exclusively available at
[3:58:40.060 --> 3:58:44.300]  mformershore.com. Thank you all for your support. You're really going to miss out if you don't get it.
[3:58:46.140 --> 3:58:52.140]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S. that supplies the highest
[3:58:52.140 --> 3:58:57.660]  quality signature reducing faraday cages, the Pentagon and other U.S. government agencies.
[3:58:57.660 --> 3:59:03.980]  And now they have produced specifically for us this made in America high end line at a very
[3:59:03.980 --> 3:59:09.740]  affordable price, whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone or big pouches that protect
[3:59:09.740 --> 3:59:15.660]  laptops and iPads or big bags that promote whatever electronics you want to put in it like desktop
[3:59:15.660 --> 3:59:23.820]  computers. It is all exclusively available at mformershore.com under the Redux name. Redux is
[3:59:23.820 --> 3:59:29.420]  infowars, taking the highest quality products and bringing them directly to you at infowarshore.com.
[3:59:29.420 --> 3:59:35.900]  In this insane world, you are crazy if you don't protect your signature, your identity from identity
[3:59:35.900 --> 3:59:41.980]  theft, hackers, criminals, corporations, governments. This is one of the hottest items out there today
[3:59:41.980 --> 3:59:44.780]  that's exclusively available at infowarshore.com.
