[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, March 11th, 2022.
[00:10.000 --> 00:17.600]  Reuters, the Associated Press, the United Nations itself are all reporting what we already
[00:17.600 --> 00:21.000]  told you years ago and weeks ago.
[00:21.000 --> 00:26.680]  The United States under Obama built dozens of level three and level four bio weapon labs
[00:26.680 --> 00:35.360]  studying race specific bio weapons to kill Slavic people and others at the labs in Ukraine
[00:35.360 --> 00:36.360]  and other areas.
[00:36.360 --> 00:42.040]  There is an original 2005 article with Obama massively increasing the funding with a bill
[00:42.040 --> 00:45.600]  he put through the Senate.
[00:45.600 --> 00:50.400]  Tomorrow's news today, they are certainly trying to spin all this, but I've gotten sent
[00:50.400 --> 00:57.520]  by a lot of people articles and reports going, hey, look, they're creating a financial reset
[00:57.520 --> 01:04.120]  right now off of COVID-19 and I've been sent some of the quotes by Edward Dowd, who was
[01:04.120 --> 01:07.200]  on with this yesterday and did a great job breaking it down as well.
[01:07.200 --> 01:12.960]  But I thought, and he did that in May of 2020, but I thought I'd tell you where the original
[01:12.960 --> 01:17.800]  analysis of this came from, and that's Info Wars and Greg Reese.
[01:17.800 --> 01:29.480]  So here is that original report from two years ago in March.
[01:29.480 --> 01:36.800]  In 1816, the gold standard, an economic unit of account based on a fixed quantity of gold
[01:36.800 --> 01:43.760]  was officially adopted and the World Reserve currency became the British pound sterling.
[01:43.760 --> 01:50.840]  In 1914, after World War One, nations attempted to revive the gold standard, but it collapsed
[01:50.840 --> 01:54.200]  during the Great Depression.
[01:54.200 --> 02:00.680]  Also in 1914, the Federal Reserve Bank, a private company, was born.
[02:00.680 --> 02:05.920]  After Britain was devastated by World War Two, they were no longer a superpower, and
[02:05.920 --> 02:10.080]  so the global reserve currency needed to be reset.
[02:10.080 --> 02:15.960]  In 1944, at the Bretton Woods Conference, the U.S. dollar became the new global reserve
[02:15.960 --> 02:17.720]  currency.
[02:17.720 --> 02:22.880]  This established America as the dominant power in the world economy, giving America the sole
[02:22.880 --> 02:25.600]  ability to print dollars.
[02:25.600 --> 02:29.600]  The rest of the world would need to trade their own currency against the U.S. dollar
[02:29.600 --> 02:34.840]  in order to balance exchange rates, keeping the international economy vibrant and fluid.
[02:34.840 --> 02:41.320]  But by the 1960s, the United States had printed more U.S.D. than their gold reserves could
[02:41.320 --> 02:49.720]  cover, and by 1970, a growing American trade deficit was undermining the value of the dollar.
[02:49.720 --> 02:57.040]  On August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon brought an end to the gold standard.
[02:57.040 --> 03:04.400]  Federal Reserve notes, a fiat currency backed by debt rather than gold, became the new standard.
[03:04.400 --> 03:08.660]  This is basically no different than an IOU.
[03:08.660 --> 03:13.880]  As one would expect, right after President Nixon gave his speech, inflation began to
[03:13.880 --> 03:18.880]  rise and America's biggest export became debt.
[03:18.880 --> 03:24.400]  The creation of the Petro dollar gave the U.S. even more sway over world economies,
[03:24.400 --> 03:28.760]  and today the international debt has become untenable.
[03:28.760 --> 03:33.880]  And many are saying another global currency reset is needed.
[03:33.880 --> 03:39.520]  Historically, the gold standard has been the most stable economy we have known, but gold
[03:39.520 --> 03:43.000]  can be manipulated and disruptive as well.
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.520]  Some are suggesting that cryptocurrency could be the solution.
[03:47.520 --> 03:52.600]  Crypto is run by an algorithm and can be designed to meet specific needs.
[03:52.600 --> 03:57.880]  The global currency needs to have fluid supply, and the limited gold supply failed to keep
[03:57.880 --> 03:59.880]  up with economic growth.
[03:59.880 --> 04:07.680]  A sovereign-free algorithm-based alternative could potentially be more stable.
[04:07.680 --> 04:14.040]  China is almost ready to launch their own cryptocurrency, DCEP, short for Digital Currency
[04:14.040 --> 04:15.960]  Electronic Payments.
[04:15.960 --> 04:20.600]  DCEP is government-controlled and fully centralized.
[04:20.600 --> 04:24.960]  So far, it appears to be a digital version of fiat paper money.
[04:24.960 --> 04:30.080]  The Federal Reserve Bank is developing their own crypto called Fedcoin.
[04:30.080 --> 04:36.120]  The coronavirus pandemic seems to be the perfect storm for a global currency reset.
[04:36.120 --> 04:41.600]  The amount of money printing involved in holding up failing economies as quarantines and shutdowns
[04:41.600 --> 04:48.560]  take place will be unprecedented, and all this does is weaken the U.S. dollar even more.
[04:48.560 --> 04:53.600]  And when the U.S. dollar falls, it will be replaced by something.
[04:53.600 --> 04:57.440]  The question is, which way will it go?
[04:57.440 --> 05:01.080]  This is Greg Ries for Infowars.com.
[05:01.080 --> 05:04.960]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022.
[05:04.960 --> 05:11.200]  And in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship
[05:11.200 --> 05:16.960]  product, the X3, that has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for
[05:16.960 --> 05:23.320]  every electrochemical cellular activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina,
[05:23.320 --> 05:24.320]  your libido.
[05:24.320 --> 05:25.320]  So much.
[05:25.320 --> 05:28.320]  And the majority of the population in the world is iodine deficient.
[05:28.320 --> 05:30.600]  This is the very best iodine out there.
[05:30.600 --> 05:35.520]  So we have on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or isn't going
[05:35.520 --> 05:37.040]  to come in for a long time.
[05:37.040 --> 05:39.040]  So I took it back to full process.
[05:39.040 --> 05:42.800]  I was just thinking, you know what, we need the funds in now to stay on air.
[05:42.800 --> 05:45.360]  Plus, this is the right product everybody needs.
[05:45.360 --> 05:49.160]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience
[05:49.160 --> 05:54.120]  it yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells
[05:54.120 --> 05:55.120]  out.
[05:55.120 --> 06:22.120]  X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[06:22.120 --> 06:29.120]  All right, you got it.
[06:29.120 --> 06:32.120]  You got it.
[06:32.120 --> 06:34.120]  Waging war on corruption.
[06:34.120 --> 06:36.120]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[06:36.120 --> 06:37.120]  Live.
[06:37.120 --> 06:39.120]  Money's refriding from 11am to 3pm central at infowars.com.
[06:39.120 --> 06:42.120]  We are the resistance.
[06:42.120 --> 06:44.120]  World War III.
[06:44.120 --> 06:46.120]  Emergency broadcast.
[06:46.120 --> 06:48.120]  The back screen.
[06:48.120 --> 06:57.120]  World War III, ladies and gentlemen, emergency broadcast, globalist preparing to launch chemical,
[06:57.120 --> 07:04.120]  biological, radiological attacks in Ukraine as pretext to initiate Armageddon.
[07:04.120 --> 07:05.120]  Watch live.
[07:05.120 --> 07:09.120]  You don't believe in the Bible, you don't believe in revelation.
[07:09.120 --> 07:17.120]  Okay, that's your right, but even if you see it as an act of fiction, a work of fiction,
[07:17.120 --> 07:23.120]  many times folks take works of fiction and use them as inspiration to actually do the
[07:23.120 --> 07:30.120]  real thing, so either way you slice it, no matter what angle you look at it, the world
[07:30.120 --> 07:37.120]  is on the verge of mass death on scales never before seen.
[07:37.120 --> 07:43.120]  And we have a delusional Joe Biden, I have the video right here, saying they're going
[07:43.120 --> 07:47.120]  to win the midterms and that the Democrats have done an excellent job, which they have
[07:47.120 --> 07:49.120]  of destroying the country.
[07:49.120 --> 07:55.120]  And then I've got this clip of Lindsey Graham saying you can't admire Joe Biden as a person,
[07:55.120 --> 08:02.120]  you've got a problem, and you need to do some self-evaluation, because what's not to like?
[08:02.120 --> 08:06.120]  He's the nicest person I think I've ever met in politics.
[08:06.120 --> 08:12.120]  He is as good a man as God ever created.
[08:12.120 --> 08:22.120]  That is the delusional level of these creatures.
[08:22.120 --> 08:29.120]  Now obviously we're going to get to the big news, and there's a lot of it, but the fact
[08:29.120 --> 08:40.120]  that the UN came out and said, yeah, we told, because we're the boss, we told Ukraine to
[08:40.120 --> 08:44.120]  destroy their bio weapon labs before it fell in the hands of the Russians.
[08:44.120 --> 08:47.120]  You need to get rid of the evidence of what you were creating.
[08:47.120 --> 08:53.120]  And you see, I don't need to know if the UN told the truth there, because we literally
[08:53.120 --> 08:58.120]  have covered on air the last few weeks hundreds of mainstream news articles from years ago
[08:58.120 --> 09:06.120]  and the legislation when they weren't hiding it, that they built these bio weapon labs there
[09:06.120 --> 09:18.120]  inside of Ukraine, just like the West funded the facility in Wuhan, mainly the United States.
[09:18.120 --> 09:23.120]  So I already knew the Russians were telling the truth when they said all this two weeks ago,
[09:23.120 --> 09:30.120]  three weeks ago, and we got called Russian agents because we didn't lie to you.
[09:30.120 --> 09:31.120]  I'm an agent of truth.
[09:31.120 --> 09:32.120]  I try to tell the truth.
[09:32.120 --> 09:34.120]  I get things wrong occasionally.
[09:34.120 --> 09:36.120]  I wish I was wrong about the New World Order.
[09:36.120 --> 09:37.120]  I'm not.
[09:37.120 --> 09:38.120]  I wish I was wrong about the Great Reset.
[09:38.120 --> 09:39.120]  I'm not.
[09:39.120 --> 09:42.120]  I wish there wasn't this many evil people running around.
[09:42.120 --> 09:43.120]  There are.
[09:43.120 --> 09:47.120]  There's also a lot of ignorant people, but there's also a lot of good people.
[09:47.120 --> 09:54.120]  But when you look at the type of news I've got today, it's just incredible taken all together.
[09:54.120 --> 10:03.120]  Hospitals around the world, public hospitals, are announcing that people with Ukrainian
[10:03.120 --> 10:11.120]  disease, Belarusian or Russian type Slavic names will be run through databases and they
[10:11.120 --> 10:17.120]  find out that you are a Russian or a Belarusian, you will be denied medical care.
[10:17.120 --> 10:20.120]  That is the global social credit score that they've got ready.
[10:20.120 --> 10:24.120]  The UK already says, if we say you're a racist, you don't get health care.
[10:24.120 --> 10:26.120]  That social is health care for you.
[10:26.120 --> 10:31.120]  And it gets worse.
[10:31.120 --> 10:33.120]  Remember three years ago?
[10:33.120 --> 10:36.120]  I wanted to get Paul on today about this, but he's moving, so he couldn't come on.
[10:36.120 --> 10:38.120]  He's coming on Monday.
[10:38.120 --> 10:45.120]  But Paul and I, along with Lewis Faircon of all people, ten people were listed a couple
[10:45.120 --> 10:46.120]  years ago.
[10:46.120 --> 10:47.120]  It was a big headline.
[10:47.120 --> 10:50.120]  It was the same headline as this.
[10:50.120 --> 10:55.120]  Facebook writes new rules allowing calls for violence against these individuals.
[10:55.120 --> 10:58.120]  And they thought, well, the public accepts it for these ten people.
[10:58.120 --> 11:03.120]  Paul Watson, Alex Jones, Lewis Faircon and seven others, Gavin McGinnis, was another one.
[11:03.120 --> 11:08.120]  If they allow this, then we can do anything we want.
[11:08.120 --> 11:10.120]  So this is all beta testing to get what they want.
[11:10.120 --> 11:11.120]  Well, look at this.
[11:11.120 --> 11:12.120]  StepOnInFullWords.com.
[11:12.120 --> 11:13.120]  I've been warned.
[11:13.120 --> 11:15.120]  It links right through to Facebook's new rules.
[11:15.120 --> 11:21.120]  Facebook, Instagram to temporarily allow calls for violence against Russians.
[11:21.120 --> 11:23.120]  Well, it is violence.
[11:23.120 --> 11:33.120]  It made your hospitals, public hospitals and private facilities as well to have a database
[11:33.120 --> 11:36.120]  of what nationality somebody is and then deny them health care.
[11:36.120 --> 11:39.120]  It's a violation of the credit code, so much more.
[11:39.120 --> 11:40.120]  That's literally Nazi medicine.
[11:40.120 --> 11:43.120]  So, of course, it's going on in Germany.
[11:43.120 --> 11:45.120]  Old dogs don't learn new tricks, do they?
[11:45.120 --> 11:49.120]  Leopards don't change their spots.
[11:49.120 --> 11:56.120]  So, here it is, Munich, major private clinic does not want to treat Russians and Belarusians.
[11:56.120 --> 11:59.120]  And now, public hospitals are saying the same.
[11:59.120 --> 12:04.120]  So, that's where you are, ladies and gentlemen, and it's incredibly dangerous.
[12:04.120 --> 12:11.120]  Now, Russia's been complaining about these bio-weapon labs for about seven, eight years
[12:11.120 --> 12:17.120]  since war broke out there, but I found articles from 2005 and 2006 when they said,
[12:17.120 --> 12:24.120]  we're building them there because the Russians haven't complained.
[12:24.120 --> 12:29.120]  Of course, Americans complained about having level four labs here.
[12:29.120 --> 12:31.120]  It was a big scandal in 2015.
[12:31.120 --> 12:35.120]  They were moved out of Chapel Hill, North Carolina and the University of Texas at Galveston
[12:35.120 --> 12:40.120]  and Baylor Medical Center, all three had a big scandal because they were handling
[12:40.120 --> 12:48.120]  a horn-weaponized bird flu mixed with coronavirus.
[12:48.120 --> 12:50.120]  You may have heard of it lately.
[12:50.120 --> 12:58.120]  It's called COVID-19, which is confirmed to be made in a lab in Chapel Hill and shipped to Wuhan.
[12:58.120 --> 12:59.120]  On record, it's all out.
[12:59.120 --> 13:00.120]  It's all public now.
[13:00.120 --> 13:05.120]  They just hope you just move on to the Russia war and forget about all that.
[13:05.120 --> 13:09.120]  It's what they're hoping every waking second.
[13:09.120 --> 13:15.120]  So this is a pretty big deal, isn't it?
[13:15.120 --> 13:23.120]  Well, guess who we got coming on in the third hour?
[13:23.120 --> 13:29.120]  It's a surprise guest, and I'll tell you about it next segment, but it's a big deal when it comes to COVID
[13:29.120 --> 13:35.120]  and it's a big guess we haven't had on yet, and so that's going to be happening.
[13:35.120 --> 13:40.120]  So look for us to be laying all of that out for you.
[13:40.120 --> 13:48.120]  And then I'm going to get to these clips as well of Saki and CNN and the incredible arrogance in Jesse Smollett.
[13:48.120 --> 13:51.120]  Sentenced after he was found guilty yesterday.
[13:51.120 --> 13:58.120]  He was found guilty a few weeks ago, but he was sentenced yesterday to 150 days in jail.
[13:58.120 --> 14:00.120]  And of course, he screamed, I am innocent.
[14:00.120 --> 14:02.120]  Don't let them kill me in jail.
[14:02.120 --> 14:06.120]  You know, I'm not going to commit suicide.
[14:06.120 --> 14:13.120]  And now he gets to go spend 150 days in the Chicago jail, which he's not going to like because I don't think he's even gay.
[14:13.120 --> 14:15.120]  He's a guy that just everything about his fake.
[14:15.120 --> 14:19.120]  He says he's gay so that he can then, you know, be cool in Hollywood and the rest of it.
[14:19.120 --> 14:29.120]  Everything about this man is fake because he is a cousin of Kamala Harris, the clueless one.
[14:29.120 --> 14:37.120]  And so you got to kind of feel sorry for really stupid, empty people because they just take on affectations.
[14:37.120 --> 14:39.120]  They're actors.
[14:39.120 --> 14:42.120]  They take on the behavior of other people they watched and things they've seen.
[14:42.120 --> 14:48.120]  They're a mile wide and a half inch deep.
[14:48.120 --> 14:55.120]  And we project our intelligence onto them at our grave, grave peril.
[14:55.120 --> 15:04.120]  I mean, Kamala Harris is a buffoon as she represents the United States and Europe during this crisis in Ukraine.
[15:04.120 --> 15:05.120]  And we're going to place it with that coming up.
[15:05.120 --> 15:11.120]  I mean, it's such complete crazy level that you'd think that you were visiting a mental hospital.
[15:11.120 --> 15:19.120]  And it's not just certain times you watch whole speeches and whole press conferences and she is literally the most disingenuous person.
[15:19.120 --> 15:25.120]  I mean, I mean, I wouldn't buy ice water from her in the Sahara Desert.
[15:25.120 --> 15:26.120]  I wouldn't buy a coat from her.
[15:26.120 --> 15:29.120]  I was butt naked in the middle of the North Pole.
[15:29.120 --> 15:33.120]  I mean, and this is who they send.
[15:33.120 --> 15:36.120]  What's going on here?
[15:36.120 --> 15:39.120]  Well, it's the incompetence of a degenerating global elite.
[15:39.120 --> 15:45.120]  There is a global control system and these people have just inherited it and they're all smoking their own dope.
[15:45.120 --> 15:50.120]  They're believing their own bull and they're going to blow the planet up if they don't get stopped.
[15:50.120 --> 15:55.120]  Now, the question is how to stop them and not blow the planet up in the process.
[15:55.120 --> 16:19.120]  We're right backstage with us.
[16:19.120 --> 16:29.120]  We're right backstage with us.
[16:29.120 --> 16:39.120]  We're right backstage with us.
[16:39.120 --> 16:49.120]  We're right backstage with us.
[16:49.120 --> 16:59.120]  We're right backstage with us.

[1:19:37.120 --> 1:20:05.120]  We're right backstage with us.
[1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:07.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:35.120 --> 1:20:39.120]  And he's here for only another eight, nine minutes.
[1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:41.120]  He's got to go. I've got so many questions.
[1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:47.120]  Just briefly, what else do you want to get out to folks that's developed since your big Citizen's Grand Jury?
[1:20:47.120 --> 1:20:49.120]  But first, can you just tell us?
[1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:52.120]  I mean, I know I watched it, but or parts of it.
[1:20:52.120 --> 1:20:56.120]  What the findings of the Citizen's Grand Jury was?
[1:20:56.120 --> 1:21:00.120]  Well, the net result is that this has never been about health.
[1:21:00.120 --> 1:21:03.120]  This is just one gigantic hoax.
[1:21:03.120 --> 1:21:07.120]  I keep telling people that had somebody told me this two years ago,
[1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:11.120]  I would have told them to go take their pills, see a doctor, and everything will be fine.
[1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:14.120]  But in the meantime, it looks like we're running out of conspiracy theories.
[1:21:14.120 --> 1:21:18.120]  All of these formerly conspiracy theories turn out to be true.
[1:21:18.120 --> 1:21:21.120]  So the most important result is it's not about health.
[1:21:21.120 --> 1:21:24.120]  So the big question is what, what is it about?
[1:21:24.120 --> 1:21:32.120]  So we spoke with geopoliticians, historians, all kinds of scientists from all walks of science.
[1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:38.120]  And the short answer is this is about global world domination.
[1:21:38.120 --> 1:21:46.120]  It's a probably relatively small group of very rich people who are trying to gain complete control over the rest of the world,
[1:21:46.120 --> 1:21:53.120]  which they have looted and plundered at least over the last three, four, five decades, probably much longer.
[1:21:53.120 --> 1:22:00.120]  And it was only a question of time when we would come on to them and when we would understand what's really been going on.
[1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:07.120]  The first time that at least I as a former banker should have woken up is during the Lehman crisis,
[1:22:07.120 --> 1:22:12.120]  which started out as a housing crisis, but it was really a banking crisis.
[1:22:12.120 --> 1:22:16.120]  Because that's the first time that everyone should have known this is a gigantic fraud.
[1:22:16.120 --> 1:22:22.120]  This is how they sell homes in the United States and in Germany defrauding people out of their money
[1:22:22.120 --> 1:22:28.120]  and selling these homes at two or three times its actual fair market value.
[1:22:28.120 --> 1:22:32.120]  This is what happened in Germany and this is what happened in the United States.
[1:22:32.120 --> 1:22:40.120]  But the only thing we got from our politicians who we then thought were our politicians is promises.
[1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:43.120]  This is never going to happen again. We're going to hold everyone responsible.
[1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:46.120]  Well, they didn't do anything. No one went to jail.
[1:22:46.120 --> 1:22:50.120]  The only thing they did is they kept printing money.
[1:22:50.120 --> 1:22:56.120]  And this thing, of course, couldn't go. It had to explode and it was about to implode again.
[1:22:56.120 --> 1:23:03.120]  The entire system was about to implode again probably in September of 2019.
[1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:11.120]  There was a meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole in Wyoming and we know that they were in a huge panic back then.
[1:23:11.120 --> 1:23:22.120]  BlackRock, for example, suggested that something really bold needed to be done in order to distract people from what was really going on.
[1:23:22.120 --> 1:23:30.120]  So that is when they came up with the idea that this is the right moment for Corona.
[1:23:30.120 --> 1:23:38.120]  So ultimately, this is what it's about. They want complete control because if we find out about them, they're not going to last much longer.
[1:23:38.120 --> 1:23:42.120]  They want complete control. They want a one-world government.
[1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:52.120]  It's the globalists whom you mentioned. One-world government and they want one-world currency, digital currency, so that they can dictate,
[1:23:52.120 --> 1:23:59.120]  much like the Chinese social credit system, they can dictate and control everything we do.
[1:23:59.120 --> 1:24:09.120]  And when we found that out, we realized that the only way you can deal with this is not to fix the system because I don't think this system can be fixed.
[1:24:09.120 --> 1:24:12.120]  And none of the people I spoke with.
[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:21.120]  Well, this system is totally predatory. I agree. It is designed to implode all of us to maintain control so they ride us down through a control collapse.
[1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:32.120]  Exactly. So the one way out is to create us, those who ask questions, who are creative, who are not used to following orders.
[1:24:32.120 --> 1:24:44.120]  We have the power and we have the right and I think we have the duty to set up our own system of healthcare, of economics, of education and, yes, judiciary.
[1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:58.120]  This should be a parallel system. It'll be so attractive that the other side or many of those who are still on the other side will jump off the fence on our side of the fence and will ultimately help us.
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:09.120]  But for the time being, we have to do something to stop this. It looks as though the Corona narrative is about to implode. It has imploded in many parts of the world.
[1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:14.120]  That was my next question and then you're going to join us again soon for a full hour when you're on the road middle of the night. Thank you, doctor.
[1:25:14.120 --> 1:25:22.120]  But clearly it's imploding very fast. And I predicted once it started imploding, they'd launch a war. Why do you think it's imploding so fast?
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:27.120]  And I don't want us to be too confident. What are you worried about? Because you know they're going to try something else.
[1:25:27.120 --> 1:25:39.120]  Well, they are trying something else already. The new way to put us in panic mode is through war. There's war in Ukraine and the big question is, what is it really that's going on there?
[1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:49.120]  I think this is part of their agenda. Just today, we had another hearing of the Corona Committee in Berlin and we spoke with a group of people.
[1:25:49.120 --> 1:26:02.120]  One of them is an American who really know everything about what's going on there, about the long term historical backdrop of the geopolitical consequences of what's happening and what has been happening.
[1:26:02.120 --> 1:26:10.120]  It looks as though it's not a stage war. It's a real war. So we have to feel really sorry about the people who are suffering there.
[1:26:10.120 --> 1:26:24.120]  But it looks as though Ukraine is just another puppet of the Anglo-American financial mafia, as I call them. That's the city of London, not London, but the city of London and its fifth column, Wall Street.
[1:26:24.120 --> 1:26:38.120]  They're using them as pawns in the Ukrainians. And they're doing this in order to drive a wedge between, just like World War I and World War II, between Russia and the West.
[1:26:38.120 --> 1:26:50.120]  It's going to be NATO against Russia. And I think that's what all the rhetoric is aimed at, the rhetoric of our politicians, our politicians, just like in the United States.
[1:26:50.120 --> 1:27:04.120]  They're all talking as though we're at war with Russia, even though it's just Ukraine and Russia. And I believe that if you take a closer look at how this war started, you'll come up with a completely different picture,
[1:27:04.120 --> 1:27:23.120]  including that Russia was humiliated for at least eight years by Ukrainians bombarding the autonomous regions of the Donbas, as they call it, and never ever being able to strike back.
[1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:30.120]  So they drew several red lines. I'm not saying they're good people. I mean, the Russians are good people. I'm not saying Putin is a good man.
[1:27:30.120 --> 1:27:36.120]  I don't know if he is. But yeah, if you start a fight with people, you're going to get a fight. Exactly. And that's what happened.
[1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:42.120]  They provoked him so much that he just didn't have a choice. Now, the big question is, will it get out of control or not?
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:50.120]  If it does get out of control, we will have a real war in all of Europe, and the major battlefield will be Germany.
[1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:56.120]  Well, I noticed years ago, different globalists said, if you try to get rid of the EU, there'll be a war in Europe.
[1:27:56.120 --> 1:28:02.120]  And you were like, a war in Europe? Why would that happen? No, they were saying, we'll start one. And they'll just cross Russian red lines and start a war.
[1:28:02.120 --> 1:28:10.120]  And that's what Biden even encouraged Putin to invade. And that's what I'm like. Hey, you need to not invade Putin, but we're here now.
[1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:16.120]  All right. Well, in the near future, Dr. Reiner Fulmick, I hope you'll join us. You're doing incredible work.
[1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:20.120]  I know talking to crowds of thousands, tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands.
[1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:29.120]  They obviously launched COVID as a power grab to try to make us forget about globalism. I think it's been in the ass. What do you think?
[1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:37.120]  Globalism is, of course, the one thing that we don't want. We want our own sovereignty. We want our individual identities.
[1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:46.120]  We want our individual cultures. The reason we're traveling to Italy or to France is not despite the fact that they're different.
[1:28:46.120 --> 1:28:51.120]  It's because they're different and we want we want them to be different. We do not want globalists.
[1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:54.120]  We have to disconnect from the globalists, both from here.
[1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:58.120]  That's right. Dr. Fulmick, incredible job. Talk to you soon.
[1:28:58.120 --> 1:29:18.120]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022. And in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, X3.
[1:29:18.120 --> 1:29:29.120]  You know what? We need the funds in now to stay on air. Plus, this is the right product everybody needs.
[1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:38.120]  So incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it yourself.
[1:29:38.120 --> 1:29:58.120]  And support the broadcast. I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out. Get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[1:29:58.120 --> 1:30:05.120]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great info wars listeners and viewers.
[1:30:05.120 --> 1:30:16.120]  If you will simply get X3 with all three types of good iodine that boosts your immune system and help everything that goes on your body at the cellular level, it will change your life.
[1:30:16.120 --> 1:30:23.120]  It will invigorate you. It will empower you. Almost everyone has iodine deficiency. Look into it for yourself.
[1:30:23.120 --> 1:30:30.120]  It's the opposite of fluoride. It's the good halogen. And then your purchase of X3 funds our operation.
[1:30:30.120 --> 1:30:36.120]  Now a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because of the lockdowns and supply chain breakdowns.
[1:30:36.120 --> 1:30:41.120]  We were sold out of X3 for a long time. And I had it on sale for 50% off. A lot of folks were getting it.
[1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:46.120]  And I was thinking, you know what? I'm going to bring it back on sale again just until it sells out.
[1:30:46.120 --> 1:30:53.120]  Because even though we won't make as much money in the long run, a lot of folks need this product and we need to get the money from the sales in now to stay on air.
[1:30:53.120 --> 1:30:58.120]  So eat your X3 right now at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:58.120 --> 1:31:08.120]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[1:31:08.120 --> 1:31:18.120]  And when it comes to information, boy is that true today. We see the entire global corrupt, anti-human depopulation, great reset combine.
[1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:28.120]  Trying to collapse our society, to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision. Suppressing the voices of good people all around the world.
[1:31:28.120 --> 1:31:37.120]  And of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID-19 area, their world's going to end in 2030.
[1:31:37.120 --> 1:31:47.120]  Carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it. And none of it can succeed. None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[1:31:47.120 --> 1:31:55.120]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence. And that's why it's hard to share info wars links and band up video links.
[1:31:55.120 --> 1:31:58.120]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[1:31:58.120 --> 1:32:07.120]  Get our great bag of it here. I mean this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[1:32:07.120 --> 1:32:14.120]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[1:32:14.120 --> 1:32:19.120]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune.
[1:32:19.120 --> 1:32:24.120]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it. And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[1:32:24.120 --> 1:32:29.120]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[1:32:29.120 --> 1:32:33.120]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[1:32:33.120 --> 1:32:40.120]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere. It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[1:32:40.120 --> 1:32:47.120]  Um, in fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story. Um, we had like the, I'm not sure if you want to believe it.
[1:32:47.120 --> 1:32:52.120]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[1:32:52.120 --> 1:33:17.120]  And if you don't find us and don't want to stare, that's fine.
[1:33:17.120 --> 1:33:30.120]  Live from the infowar.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:30.120 --> 1:33:35.120]  Alright folks, tune in here for tomorrow's news today.
[1:33:35.120 --> 1:33:45.120]  And so I'm going to tell you what I see happening, what's in the tea leaves and what is a very, very good chance or probability of happening.
[1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:52.120]  There's a few different scenarios and he detailed his financial news into the war news and the COVID news.
[1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:59.120]  And we'll do that here in just a moment.
[1:33:59.120 --> 1:34:06.120]  But I wanted to spend just a few minutes with the listeners who are the best people on earth.
[1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:12.120]  You know, Lindsey Graham says that Joe Biden's the best guy on earth. Well, no, I don't think that's true.
[1:34:12.120 --> 1:34:29.120]  I think the listeners and viewers of this broadcast objectively have supported and have amplified and who have prayed for this broadcast.
[1:34:29.120 --> 1:34:35.120]  That you are the most effective, best people in the world.
[1:34:35.120 --> 1:34:40.120]  What did Lindsey Graham said? He said, if you can't admire, get that clip ready guys.
[1:34:40.120 --> 1:34:46.120]  If you can't admire Joe Biden as a person, you've got a problem and you need to do some self evaluation.
[1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:51.120]  Because what's not to like? He's the nicest person I think I've ever met in politics.
[1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:56.120]  He is as good a man as God ever created.
[1:34:56.120 --> 1:35:05.120]  Liquidating our borders, devaluing our currency, cutting off our pipelines, teaching critical race theory with federal funds and schools.
[1:35:05.120 --> 1:35:15.120]  The list just goes on and on and Lindsey Graham, a supposed Christian, conservative, is telling us he's the best thing since sliced bread.
[1:35:15.120 --> 1:35:18.120]  Here's the clip.
[1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:23.120]  If you can't admire Joe Biden as a person, then it's probably, you've got a problem.
[1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:28.120]  You need to do some self evaluation because what's not to like?
[1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:33.120]  And he's the nicest person I think I've ever met in politics.
[1:35:33.120 --> 1:35:37.120]  Is that right? He is as good a man as God ever created.
[1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:43.120]  If you can't admire Joe Biden. You know, I know a very well known person, I won't say his name, but he was at Mar-a-Lago last week.
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:50.120]  And Lindsey Graham was standing facing the pool with his bat to him and he said he almost pushed him in.
[1:35:50.120 --> 1:35:56.120]  And I told this fellow, I said, I wish, I'm not going to give you his initials.
[1:35:56.120 --> 1:36:05.120]  I can start with an R, that name with an S. I wish he would just push his ass in. But you know, that would give him too much attention to make him a victim.
[1:36:05.120 --> 1:36:14.120]  So don't do that. But what the hell does Trump thinking that he has this snake at Mar-a-Lago all the time?
[1:36:14.120 --> 1:36:18.120]  But I'm going to stop right there. I'm going to behave myself.
[1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:23.120]  The point is, is that we're not funded by the globalist. We're funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[1:36:23.120 --> 1:36:31.120]  And we're doing more important work than we have ever done on air at this point.
[1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:37.120]  And the world is listening and the world is watching and we're taking on the corrupt power structure and we're in their face.
[1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:47.120]  So when I say I admire this audience of activists, when I say you're the best people, it's not some fake globalist worshiping each other.
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:53.120]  Because all that's just talk with you and I, I really mean it. I mean, you folks are awesome.
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:56.120]  And I appreciate your support because you're supporting yourself while you do that.
[1:36:56.120 --> 1:37:06.120]  And I just want to stay in this fight. And the fact that you keep me in this fight, I love you only second to God and my children.
[1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:10.120]  You're right there. It's like God's right here. My children are right there. Family.
[1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:17.120]  You're, you're, it's when you walk up and thank me in the street, I just go, OK, stop, stop, because we're, it's like me.
[1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:20.120]  Look in the mirror, thinking myself, we are in this together.
[1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:30.120]  So I want to encourage all the viewers, all the listeners to be part of history and to get t-shirts and books and films and amazing supplements and products at infowarstore.com.
[1:37:30.120 --> 1:37:35.120]  Because that's where you get great products that edify you, make your life better and healthier.
[1:37:35.120 --> 1:37:44.120]  And that's where you fund the info war, a 360 win infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:52.120]  And we're entering the thick of the battle right now and things are so intense, but as bad as the attacks are, the successes are even way bigger.
[1:37:52.120 --> 1:37:59.120]  So I understand that's how this alchemy works and I understand no pain, no gain, but I am willing to go through the pain.
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:09.120]  I just need you to carry us to the next level, so thank you for your financial support while you get great products at infowarstore.com.
[1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:15.120]  OK, let's hit this right now.
[1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:22.120]  Let's cover this, this segment the next and let's talk about it.
[1:38:22.120 --> 1:38:40.120]  What does it say about the establishment and the corporate media that they would know that the U.S. built bio weapons labs going back to 2004 and five under Obama?
[1:38:40.120 --> 1:38:49.120]  2005 in that country and it was all over the news and congressional funding and bills and c-span debates.
[1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:59.120]  That's like saying that Pat Brady never played for the New England Patriots.
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:05.120]  But you know when you hear that Pat Brady never played for the New England Patriots, never won a Super Bowl.
[1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:07.120]  Right away you go, that's a lie.
[1:39:07.120 --> 1:39:09.120]  So someone asked you a question.
[1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:20.120]  Why would the bureaucrats in the media and CNN and AP and Reuters and all of them tell you there were no bio labs in Ukraine?
[1:39:20.120 --> 1:39:24.120]  There were no deadly pathogens, that's all a lie.
[1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:27.120]  Why would U.S. say today and all of them say that?
[1:39:27.120 --> 1:39:34.120]  Knowing it's going to come out and knowing they're going to get exposed as liars.
[1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:47.120]  And the answer is they've got such third and fourth and fifth and sixth and seventh and eighth and ninth level stringers, back ventures.
[1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:49.120]  They don't even know all these topics.
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:51.120]  They don't even know all these facts.
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:54.120]  They can't even come up with plausible lies.
[1:39:54.120 --> 1:40:03.120]  We're fighting like when the Russians went into Berlin in 1945, 12 year olds, all the other men are dead.
[1:40:03.120 --> 1:40:06.120]  And they're dangerous but they don't know what they're doing.
[1:40:06.120 --> 1:40:09.120]  They blow themselves up as often as they blow you up.
[1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:10.120]  So they're dangerous.
[1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:11.120]  You've got to respect it.
[1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:15.120]  But we're fighting the dregs.
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:18.120]  We're fighting the fumes.
[1:40:18.120 --> 1:40:26.120]  And I don't say that from a place of strength because the fumes, the zombies are in control of everything.
[1:40:26.120 --> 1:40:28.120]  And the competence is disappearing.
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:32.120]  And the work ethic is disappearing.
[1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:42.120]  And we could barely run civilization when we had hard working, really smart men and women busting their asses to make it work.
[1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:46.120]  Working around the clock, just wanting to innovate.
[1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:48.120]  You start not wanting to work.
[1:40:48.120 --> 1:40:50.120]  You start not wanting to know how stuff works.
[1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:52.120]  You start wanting to be lazy and dumb.
[1:40:52.120 --> 1:41:01.120]  Civilization will collapse back into the jungle from which it came, just like that.
[1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:03.120]  And some folks will say, well, good, civilization's out of control.
[1:41:03.120 --> 1:41:11.120]  Well, there's thousands of nuclear reactors, 468 of them that are large that we know of, a bunch of other small ones.
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:13.120]  And civilization breaks down.
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:15.120]  Those all go chair noble.
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:17.120]  And then there's all the rest of it.
[1:41:17.120 --> 1:41:27.120]  So it's such a big deal to me, before we come back and break all this down, to first realize they just deny whatever we say.
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:33.120]  Doesn't matter we had all the articles, doesn't matter we had the bills, doesn't matter we had the documents, doesn't matter we had it all.
[1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:35.120]  Doesn't matter it was big controversies.
[1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:42.120]  So we just all remembered it because we have a thing called a memory because we're not goldfish.
[1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:50.120]  But you got to understand the people putting out the BS are lazy and just regurgitate what they're told and don't even think.
[1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:55.120]  Biden didn't come out and say, I'm sorry it's hard on you, but it's the best thing for the people of Ukraine.
[1:41:55.120 --> 1:41:56.120]  We're going to try to fix it.
[1:41:56.120 --> 1:41:58.120]  He didn't even give them false hope.
[1:41:58.120 --> 1:42:01.120]  He said, yeah, it's going to go up a lot more.
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:12.120]  Started laughing, just like the head of the Department of Energy, just like the head of the Department of Transportation, just like the White House Press Secretary, just like Nancy Pelosi,
[1:42:12.120 --> 1:42:19.120]  laughing at you because they get off on that.
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:29.120]  They get off, you're their enemy, they were brought into power to destroy America and they're laughing at you while they do it.
[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:35.120]  And destroying themselves because they're incompetent, inbred, degenerate drug addicts.
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:37.120]  That's the good ones.
[1:42:37.120 --> 1:42:40.120]  The bad ones are child raping pedophiles.
[1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:46.120]  The most selfish, monstrous, sycophantic weirdos the world has ever seen.
[1:42:46.120 --> 1:42:50.120]  Doom is written all over them. Failure is inscribed on them.
[1:42:50.120 --> 1:42:56.120]  They stink from a mile away, socially, culturally, spiritually.
[1:42:56.120 --> 1:43:17.120]  We'll be right back.
[1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:30.120]  This is an absolute 360 win.
[1:43:30.120 --> 1:43:31.120]  Ain't no brainer.

[1:43:54.120 --> 1:43:56.120]  We'll be right back.
[1:44:24.120 --> 1:44:53.120]  We'll be right back.
[1:44:54.120 --> 1:45:06.120]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:12.120]  Not in Communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:15.120]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:17.120]  And that's done by design.
[1:45:17.120 --> 1:45:26.120]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment,
[1:45:26.120 --> 1:45:30.120]  the founder of the Bilderberg Group, the trilateral commission of the United Nations,
[1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:33.120]  the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[1:45:33.120 --> 1:45:39.120]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the control corporate media of the Bilderberg Group didn't exist.
[1:45:39.120 --> 1:45:42.120]  Well, now the Bilderberg Group is public in its former head.
[1:45:42.120 --> 1:45:48.120]  So the steering committee is Klaus Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[1:45:48.120 --> 1:45:53.120]  And if, as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head-on about the second thing,
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:57.120]  or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[1:45:57.120 --> 1:45:59.120]  If you expose them, we should beat them easily.
[1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:09.120]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the population's rebelled.
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:18.120]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[1:46:18.120 --> 1:46:24.120]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers,
[1:46:24.120 --> 1:46:33.120]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:36.120]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[1:46:36.120 --> 1:46:41.120]  The problem is some globalist-controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:50.120]  Like Canada, where they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[1:46:50.120 --> 1:46:54.120]  So pray for these folks big time. It's a very serious situation.
[1:46:54.120 --> 1:47:09.120]  And stay tuned into infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:28.120]  So the globalist or mad scientist, they've got bio weapon labs with stuff that's far worse than COVID-19 ready to release on us.
[1:47:28.120 --> 1:47:30.120]  They spread it all across the world.
[1:47:30.120 --> 1:47:39.120]  So when they do release it, they have one thing, plausible deniability, so that they won't be held accountable.
[1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:45.120]  But thanks to good scientists in private sector and in government and the US military,
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:54.120]  all the information about what Fauci and Gates and others did with the creation of COVID-19 has released has come out.
[1:47:54.120 --> 1:48:04.120]  Our enemy is not the government. Our enemy is not the corporations. Our enemy is not the black people down the street or the white people down the street or Hispanic folks or the Asians.
[1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:11.120]  Our enemy is evil people playing God and playing us off against each other.
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:19.120]  And we have to stand up and we have to get informed just like you're informed about football and you're informed about how to fix your car.
[1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:30.120]  Whatever you want to get informed about, you're going to get informed about. You're not stupid. You're ignorant.
[1:48:30.120 --> 1:48:39.120]  And when I point my finger at you, I got three more back at me. You're not stupid. You're not stupid. You're ignorant.
[1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:49.120]  And what you are is lazy because these people plan to kill us if we don't wake up and figure their plan out and stop it.
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:53.120]  But we are starting to figure it out real fast, aren't we?
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:58.120]  And we're starting to feel our human instincts are built for this. Yeah.
[1:48:58.120 --> 1:49:04.120]  We're not rolling over. We're part of a plan. We're going to the stars. We've just begun. We're not about to end.
[1:49:04.120 --> 1:49:10.120]  It's not the post-human world. It's the beginning of the human universe.
[1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:18.120]  This whole thing's laid out for us. We are in embryonic form right now about to be born.
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:30.120]  But first we got to learn to love each other because we're going to have challenges in the future with all this power we're going to have.
[1:49:30.120 --> 1:49:37.120]  Now, let's talk about it.
[1:49:37.120 --> 1:49:42.120]  To understand what's currently happening, we have to understand two years ago.
[1:49:42.120 --> 1:49:50.120]  And I walked into Greg Reese's office two years ago and I said, what are you working on?
[1:49:50.120 --> 1:49:59.120]  And he said, I'm working on the virus and what they're planning to do with it. And I said, have you thought about a financial reset?
[1:49:59.120 --> 1:50:04.120]  He said, yeah, because he reads reciprocately like I do. He goes, yeah, I've been thinking that. I said, why aren't you looking at that?
[1:50:04.120 --> 1:50:14.120]  So he put out this report. It's only got 136,000 views. His bigger report's at 3 or 4 million. It needs 10 million.
[1:50:14.120 --> 1:50:27.120]  The perfect storm for global currency reset. And this is in March 15, the Ides of March, two years ago.
[1:50:27.120 --> 1:50:30.120]  Just a few days shy of that, four days shy of that.
[1:50:30.120 --> 1:50:35.120]  Now, why is that so important? Well, I got sent this this morning. It's been big for months and we've had him on.
[1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:39.120]  He's definitely a smart guy and it is that he says he is. And I'm not stealing thunder from him.
[1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:42.120]  I just wanted to let you know there's background to this.
[1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:48.120]  This is Edward Dowd, the stock picker. He says, I have an idea for dystopian movie.
[1:50:48.120 --> 1:51:03.120]  The background begins in 2020, a virus that mimics the flu creeps across the globe. Some believe it's a man made by a weapon to provide cover for a global economic collapse for an unsustainable debt load and rising wealth inequality.
[1:51:03.120 --> 1:51:07.120]  The majority.
[1:51:07.120 --> 1:51:16.120]  And that is a very viral tweet that a lot of people ask me questions about how to big national talk shows sent to me this morning and said, what do you think of this?
[1:51:16.120 --> 1:51:21.120]  And I've got busy and haven't sent it back to him yet, but I'm going to send this back during the next break.
[1:51:21.120 --> 1:51:24.120]  I'm going to say this is what I think of it.
[1:51:24.120 --> 1:51:29.120]  Greg Reese did three reports on this starting in March, two years ago.
[1:51:29.120 --> 1:51:31.120]  And then we had articles about it.
[1:51:31.120 --> 1:51:36.120]  Davos Group announces world government to force great reset.
[1:51:36.120 --> 1:51:43.120]  June 2020.
[1:51:43.120 --> 1:51:49.120]  Now is the time for the great reset. Got it all right there for you.
[1:51:49.120 --> 1:51:51.120]  A global financial great reset is coming.
[1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:56.120]  A deal is being made between all the central banks.
[1:51:56.120 --> 1:51:58.120]  We first reported it in March.
[1:51:58.120 --> 1:52:01.120]  Here it is in April in mainstream news.
[1:52:01.120 --> 1:52:06.120]  I point at folks, I'm not playing games here and you can figure all this out very quickly.
[1:52:06.120 --> 1:52:08.120]  Here's our March 15 article that went with it.
[1:52:08.120 --> 1:52:11.120]  A perfect storm for a global currency reset.
[1:52:11.120 --> 1:52:15.120]  A global currency rate reset amidst the coronavirus pandemic.
[1:52:15.120 --> 1:52:19.120]  A real possibility.
[1:52:19.120 --> 1:52:20.120]  On the Ides of March.
[1:52:20.120 --> 1:52:22.120]  You know what the Ides of March are.
[1:52:22.120 --> 1:52:24.120]  Julius Caesar got stabbed to death.
[1:52:24.120 --> 1:52:27.120]  Roman Forum, seen as unlucky for elites.
[1:52:27.120 --> 1:52:29.120]  So there is it.
[1:52:29.120 --> 1:52:33.120]  And I'm having that article posted, the video posted, the live show feed today.
[1:52:33.120 --> 1:52:34.120]  So you can share it.
[1:52:34.120 --> 1:52:37.120]  The perfect storm for global currency reset.
[1:52:37.120 --> 1:52:43.120]  Global wars predicted financial reset two years before it began.
[1:52:43.120 --> 1:52:45.120]  Because now it's all over the news.
[1:52:45.120 --> 1:52:46.120]  They're doing it.
[1:52:46.120 --> 1:52:47.120]  And they're going to use it for that.
[1:52:47.120 --> 1:52:50.120]  And the reason I show you this is, it's planned.
[1:52:50.120 --> 1:52:54.120]  And all we do is study what they're doing.
[1:52:54.120 --> 1:52:57.120]  And instead of folks going, hey, we want to learn how you know this.
[1:52:57.120 --> 1:52:59.120]  I'm like, I want to show you how I know.
[1:52:59.120 --> 1:53:00.120]  I want to show you how I know.
[1:53:00.120 --> 1:53:02.120]  So you all know, it's like, oh, Alex.
[1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:03.120]  Oh, Alex.
[1:53:03.120 --> 1:53:05.120]  Jones is magical.
[1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:07.120]  You know what, I don't want to be magical folks.
[1:53:07.120 --> 1:53:09.120]  I want everybody to learn this.
[1:53:09.120 --> 1:53:11.120]  And other talk shows to get it.
[1:53:11.120 --> 1:53:13.120]  It's game over for the new world order.
[1:53:13.120 --> 1:53:16.120]  Just like Reimer Fulmick said earlier, as we all get educated
[1:53:16.120 --> 1:53:17.120]  to how the scam works, it's over.
[1:53:17.120 --> 1:53:21.120]  But if everybody just thinks it's some magic psychic Nostradamus thing
[1:53:21.120 --> 1:53:24.120]  that I know all this and it's only Alex Jones,
[1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:27.120]  that makes my life very dangerous and makes them want to kill me
[1:53:27.120 --> 1:53:29.120]  or put me in prison, which I'm not looking for.
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:33.120]  And it makes us lose because no one learns how stuff works.
[1:53:33.120 --> 1:53:35.120]  It's all admitted.
[1:53:35.120 --> 1:53:37.120]  It's all admitted.
[1:53:37.120 --> 1:53:39.120]  It's all admitted.
[1:53:39.120 --> 1:53:41.120]  It's all admitted.
[1:53:41.120 --> 1:53:43.120]  Let me give you another example of this.
[1:53:43.120 --> 1:53:45.120]  It pisses me off, man.
[1:53:45.120 --> 1:53:47.120]  Let me tell you, I don't hate the New York Times,
[1:53:47.120 --> 1:53:49.120]  the Washington Post, CNN people.
[1:53:49.120 --> 1:53:51.120]  I mean, I really don't.
[1:53:51.120 --> 1:53:54.120]  It's like my dog takes a dump in the backyard.
[1:53:54.120 --> 1:53:55.120]  I got to go pick it up.
[1:53:55.120 --> 1:53:56.120]  Do I hate the stuff?
[1:53:56.120 --> 1:53:58.120]  I just got to clean it up.
[1:53:58.120 --> 1:54:02.120]  I throw it, you know, in the vegetable garden.
[1:54:02.120 --> 1:54:04.120]  No, I don't want to hurt any of you people.
[1:54:04.120 --> 1:54:06.120]  Just stop trying to hurt me.
[1:54:06.120 --> 1:54:08.120]  I'm talking to the Globals right now.
[1:54:08.120 --> 1:54:10.120]  I mean, God, you people are sick.
[1:54:10.120 --> 1:54:11.120]  Look at these.
[1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:13.120]  Look at this right here.
[1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:15.120]  We have MTG on a few days ago.
[1:54:15.120 --> 1:54:20.120]  Talk about her bill that members of the House
[1:54:20.120 --> 1:54:22.120]  should have to have on record how they voted.
[1:54:22.120 --> 1:54:23.120]  Oh, what an evil woman.
[1:54:23.120 --> 1:54:28.120]  We don't want to know how you vote, the left says.
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:30.120]  And they go, apoplectic.
[1:54:30.120 --> 1:54:32.120]  They're just backing Alex Jones up at his delusion
[1:54:32.120 --> 1:54:37.120]  that there's a plan to reduce the world population by 90%.
[1:54:37.120 --> 1:54:42.120]  This story is just like the bio weapon story.
[1:54:42.120 --> 1:54:45.120]  Hundreds of articles going back to 2005,
[1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:48.120]  admitting all of it with our media saying it's good.
[1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:51.120]  Then it gets pointed out and they go, oh, no, that doesn't exist.
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:54.120]  That's the same thing here.
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:56.120]  Marjorie Tanner Green helps Alex Jones
[1:54:56.120 --> 1:54:59.120]  promote conspiracy theory claiming 90% population reduction
[1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:00.120]  in 2030.
[1:55:00.120 --> 1:55:03.120]  She helped me promote the lie.
[1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:05.120]  Oh my gosh.
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:07.120]  And then I can show you thousands of articles,
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:09.120]  Wall Street Journal, New York Times,
[1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:11.120]  looking forward to the end of humanity,
[1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:13.120]  the post-human world.
[1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:17.120]  This is the Wall Street Journal hitting the reset button
[1:55:17.120 --> 1:55:18.120]  on humanity right there.
[1:55:18.120 --> 1:55:19.120]  Oh, looking forward to the end.
[1:55:19.120 --> 1:55:20.120]  Oh, kill the humans.
[1:55:20.120 --> 1:55:21.120]  Everything's perfect.
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:24.120]  Blip, blip, blip.
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:26.120]  Interview.
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:29.120]  The head futurist at the World Economic Forum
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:31.120]  says the end of humanity is here.
[1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:33.120]  The last humans are alive now.
[1:55:33.120 --> 1:55:36.120]  We must get rid of the humans.
[1:55:36.120 --> 1:55:42.120]  No more humans.
[1:55:42.120 --> 1:55:43.120]  And it goes on and on.
[1:55:43.120 --> 1:55:47.120]  Cloud swabs, W-E-F, humans are now hackable animals
[1:55:47.120 --> 1:55:49.120]  and will soon be re-engineered.
[1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:52.120]  Coronavirus is the moment it was achieved.
[1:55:52.120 --> 1:55:55.120]  Yeah, they got into us with the GMO garbage
[1:55:55.120 --> 1:55:56.120]  and then the head of Bayer Braggs.
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:55:59.120]  Oh, we got the public to accept gene therapy
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:01.120]  by scaring them with coronavirus.
[1:56:01.120 --> 1:56:03.120]  I mean, they're bragging that they're raping us.
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:06.120]  They're taking us over, making us commodities.
[1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:08.120]  And then the left sits there with podcasts
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:10.120]  and radio shows and TV shows and newspapers
[1:56:10.120 --> 1:56:13.120]  lying about us saying we're the threat.
[1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:14.120]  We're the bad people.
[1:56:14.120 --> 1:56:19.120]  We're mean because we questioned a Jesse Smollett event
[1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:21.120]  or a mass shooting.
[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:23.120]  And you're not supposed to do that.
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:26.120]  You're the bad guys.
[1:56:26.120 --> 1:56:28.120]  NBC News, cyborgs replace humans
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:30.120]  and remake the world.
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:35.120]  By 2045, no more humans.
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:37.120]  The end of humanity is here.
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:43.120]  The last humans are now alive on Earth.
[1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:44.120]  The cyber attacks are coming.
[1:56:44.120 --> 1:56:47.120]  The Georgia guide stones, the UN,
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:50.120]  all of them saying get rid of 89% of the public
[1:56:50.120 --> 1:56:52.120]  and it's carved in stone there
[1:56:52.120 --> 1:56:54.120]  and all we're trying to do
[1:56:54.120 --> 1:56:56.120]  is to get people to think about it
[1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:57.120]  and talk about it.
[1:56:57.120 --> 1:56:58.120]  And Prince Charles talks about it
[1:56:58.120 --> 1:57:00.120]  and his dad says I want to come back as a virus
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:01.120]  until 80% of people
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:04.120]  and they've got this weird rainbow swastika thing
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:06.120]  they wear that's their symbol.
[1:57:06.120 --> 1:57:08.120]  And I mean, this is all happening
[1:57:08.120 --> 1:57:10.120]  and they've got bio labs everywhere
[1:57:10.120 --> 1:57:12.120]  with race specific weapons
[1:57:12.120 --> 1:57:14.120]  and we're not supposed to talk about that.
[1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:16.120]  And what makes me frustrated is the idiots
[1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:18.120]  that go along with this
[1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:20.120]  and help promote their own destruction.
[1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:22.120]  You almost go like man, Prince Charles,
[1:57:22.120 --> 1:57:23.120]  maybe you're right.
[1:57:23.120 --> 1:57:25.120]  Bill Gates, maybe you're right.
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:26.120]  Maybe I should have joined you
[1:57:26.120 --> 1:57:28.120]  except then you're such slime
[1:57:28.120 --> 1:57:30.120]  and so evil and so nasty
[1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:31.120]  and so hateful.
[1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:33.120]  You're like, no, that's not a good group either.
[1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:35.120]  No, we got to help everybody.
[1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:36.120]  We got to go to the stars.
[1:57:36.120 --> 1:57:38.120]  We've got to uplift humanity,
[1:57:38.120 --> 1:57:40.120]  not kill humanity.
[1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:42.120]  God will not accept us into the next level
[1:57:42.120 --> 1:57:43.120]  unless we do it.
[1:57:43.120 --> 1:57:50.120]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[1:58:13.120 --> 1:58:15.120]  And the majority of the population in the world
[1:58:15.120 --> 1:58:17.120]  is iodine deficient.
[1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:19.120]  This is the very best iodine out there.
[1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:21.120]  So we have on sale 50% off
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:23.120]  but we sold more than half of what we have
[1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:25.120]  or isn't going to come in for a long time
[1:58:25.120 --> 1:58:27.120]  so I took it back to full products
[1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:29.120]  and I was just thinking, you know what,
[1:58:29.120 --> 1:58:31.120]  we need the funds in now to stay on air
[1:58:31.120 --> 1:58:33.120]  plus this is the right product everybody needs
[1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:35.120]  so to incentivize folks out there
[1:58:35.120 --> 1:58:37.120]  that have been on the fence, get X3
[1:58:37.120 --> 1:58:38.120]  and experience it for yourself
[1:58:38.120 --> 1:58:39.120]  and support the broadcast,
[1:58:39.120 --> 1:58:41.120]  I'm going to keep it at 50% off
[1:58:41.120 --> 1:58:43.120]  until it sells out.
[1:58:43.120 --> 1:58:46.120]  Get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com
[1:58:46.120 --> 1:58:48.120]  for 50% off.
[1:58:49.120 --> 1:58:50.120]  So I did it.
[1:58:50.120 --> 1:58:52.120]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[1:58:52.120 --> 1:58:54.120]  I've been training probably not
[1:58:54.120 --> 1:58:55.120]  as much as they should be
[1:58:55.120 --> 1:58:57.120]  but thank goodness for prayer
[1:58:57.120 --> 1:59:00.120]  and thank goodness for infowarstore.com.
[1:59:00.120 --> 1:59:01.120]  Before I set out on a run,
[1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:03.120]  I throw down some turbo force
[1:59:03.120 --> 1:59:05.120]  to give me that energy I need
[1:59:05.120 --> 1:59:07.120]  to get going, you know, besides the energy,
[1:59:07.120 --> 1:59:10.120]  turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins
[1:59:10.120 --> 1:59:12.120]  I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy
[1:59:12.120 --> 1:59:14.120]  and the essential B vitamins
[1:59:14.120 --> 1:59:16.120]  plus the amino acids for sustained energy
[1:59:16.120 --> 1:59:19.120]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training
[1:59:19.120 --> 1:59:22.120]  and then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones
[1:59:22.120 --> 1:59:25.120]  Sorilis, I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[1:59:25.120 --> 1:59:27.120]  So this is great for giving my joints
[1:59:27.120 --> 1:59:29.120]  the extra support they need right now
[1:59:29.120 --> 1:59:32.120]  plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[1:59:32.120 --> 1:59:35.120]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast
[1:59:35.120 --> 1:59:36.120]  so I can get back to the training.
[1:59:36.120 --> 1:59:38.120]  Even if you're not crazy enough
[1:59:38.120 --> 1:59:40.120]  to take on a marathon, good news,
[1:59:40.120 --> 1:59:42.120]  turbo force that can still give you the energy
[1:59:42.120 --> 1:59:44.120]  and clarity you need for every day
[1:59:44.120 --> 1:59:46.120]  and Sorilis can keep you moving
[1:59:46.120 --> 1:59:48.120]  and feeling great at any age.
[1:59:49.120 --> 1:59:51.120]  Leading a frontal assault
[1:59:51.120 --> 1:59:54.120]  on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:59:54.120 --> 2:00:12.120]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:12.120 --> 2:00:15.120]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[2:00:15.120 --> 2:00:17.120]  In 1816, the gold standard,
[2:00:17.120 --> 2:00:19.120]  an economic unit of account
[2:00:19.120 --> 2:00:21.120]  based on a fixed quantity of gold
[2:00:21.120 --> 2:00:23.120]  was officially adopted
[2:00:23.120 --> 2:00:25.120]  and the World Reserve currency
[2:00:25.120 --> 2:00:27.120]  became the British pound sterling.
[2:00:27.120 --> 2:00:31.120]  In 1914, after World War I,
[2:00:31.120 --> 2:00:34.120]  nations attempted to revive the gold standard
[2:00:34.120 --> 2:00:37.120]  but it collapsed during the Great Depression.
[2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:39.120]  In 1914, after World War I,
[2:00:39.120 --> 2:00:42.120]  nations attempted to revive the gold standard
[2:00:42.120 --> 2:00:44.120]  but it collapsed during the Great Depression.
[2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:48.120]  Also in 1914, the Federal Reserve Bank,
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:50.120]  a company, was born.
[2:00:50.120 --> 2:00:53.120]  After Britain was devastated by World War II,
[2:00:53.120 --> 2:00:56.120]  they were no longer a superpower
[2:00:56.120 --> 2:00:58.120]  and so the global reserve currency
[2:00:58.120 --> 2:01:00.120]  needed to be reset.
[2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:03.120]  In 1944, at the Bretton Woods Conference,
[2:01:03.120 --> 2:01:05.120]  the U.S. Dollar became the new
[2:01:05.120 --> 2:01:07.120]  global reserve currency.
[2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:10.120]  This established America as the dominant power
[2:01:10.120 --> 2:01:12.120]  in the world economy.
[2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:16.120]  Giving America the sole ability to print dollars.
[2:01:16.120 --> 2:01:18.120]  The rest of the world would need to trade
[2:01:18.120 --> 2:01:20.120]  their own currency against the U.S. Dollar
[2:01:20.120 --> 2:01:22.120]  in order to balance exchange rates,
[2:01:22.120 --> 2:01:24.120]  keeping the international economy
[2:01:24.120 --> 2:01:26.120]  vibrant and fluid.
[2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:28.120]  But by the 1960s,
[2:01:28.120 --> 2:01:31.120]  the United States had printed more USD
[2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:33.120]  than their gold reserves could cover.
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:35.120]  And by 1970,
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:37.120]  a growing American trade deficit
[2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:40.120]  was undermining the value of the dollar.
[2:01:40.120 --> 2:01:43.120]  On August 15, 1971,
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:45.120]  President Richard Nixon brought an end
[2:01:45.120 --> 2:01:47.120]  to the gold standard.
[2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:49.120]  Federal Reserve notes,
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:52.120]  a fiat currency backed by debt rather than gold,
[2:01:52.120 --> 2:01:54.120]  became the new standard.
[2:01:54.120 --> 2:01:58.120]  This is basically no different than an IOU.
[2:01:58.120 --> 2:02:00.120]  As one would expect,
[2:02:00.120 --> 2:02:03.120]  right after President Nixon gave his speech,
[2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:05.120]  inflation began to rise
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:09.120]  and America's biggest export became debt.
[2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:11.120]  The creation of the petrodollar
[2:02:11.120 --> 2:02:13.120]  gave the U.S. even more sway
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:15.120]  over world economies.
[2:02:15.120 --> 2:02:17.120]  And today, the international debt
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:19.120]  has become untenable.
[2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:21.120]  And many are saying,
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:24.120]  another global currency reset is needed.
[2:02:24.120 --> 2:02:26.120]  Historically, the gold standard
[2:02:26.120 --> 2:02:29.120]  has been the most stable economy we have known.
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:31.120]  But gold can be manipulated
[2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:33.120]  and disruptive as well.
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:35.120]  Some are suggesting that cryptocurrency
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:37.120]  could be the solution.
[2:02:37.120 --> 2:02:39.120]  Crypto is run by an algorithm
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:42.120]  and can be designed to meet specific needs.
[2:02:42.120 --> 2:02:45.120]  The global currency needs to have fluid supply
[2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:47.120]  and the limited gold supply
[2:02:47.120 --> 2:02:50.120]  failed to keep up with economic growth.
[2:02:50.120 --> 2:02:53.120]  A sovereign free algorithm based alternative
[2:02:53.120 --> 2:02:56.120]  could potentially be more stable.
[2:02:56.120 --> 2:02:59.120]  China is almost ready to launch
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:01.120]  their own cryptocurrency,
[2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:04.120]  DCEP, short for digital currency
[2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:07.120]  electronic payments.
[2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:09.120]  DCEP is government controlled
[2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:11.120]  and fully centralized.
[2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:13.120]  So far, it appears to be
[2:03:13.120 --> 2:03:16.120]  a digital version of fiat paper money.
[2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:18.120]  The Federal Reserve Bank
[2:03:18.120 --> 2:03:20.120]  is developing their own crypto
[2:03:20.120 --> 2:03:22.120]  called Fedcoin.
[2:03:22.120 --> 2:03:24.120]  The coronavirus pandemic seems to be
[2:03:24.120 --> 2:03:27.120]  the perfect storm for a global currency reset.
[2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:29.120]  The amount of money printing involved
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:31.120]  in holding up failing economies
[2:03:31.120 --> 2:03:33.120]  as quarantines and shutdowns
[2:03:33.120 --> 2:03:36.120]  take place will be unprecedented.
[2:03:36.120 --> 2:03:38.120]  And all this does
[2:03:38.120 --> 2:03:41.120]  is weaken the US dollar even more.
[2:03:41.120 --> 2:03:43.120]  And when the US dollar falls,
[2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:45.120]  it will be replaced by something.
[2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:47.120]  The question is,
[2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:49.120]  which way will it go?
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:52.120]  This is Greg Ries for Infowars.com.
[2:03:52.120 --> 2:03:55.120]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda
[2:03:55.120 --> 2:03:57.120]  and with spiritual warfare
[2:03:57.120 --> 2:04:00.120]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food.
[2:04:00.120 --> 2:04:02.120]  It's all come out.
[2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:04.120]  Not because we're weak,
[2:04:04.120 --> 2:04:06.120]  but because we're made the image of God,
[2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:08.120]  the Creator, and we are powerful.
[2:04:08.120 --> 2:04:11.120]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:14.120]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying
[2:04:14.120 --> 2:04:16.120]  that nobody knows who first came up with
[2:04:16.120 --> 2:04:19.120]  the boy, is it true?
[2:04:19.120 --> 2:04:22.120]  The propaganda would not be necessary
[2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:25.120]  if the situation was hopeless.
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:27.120]  They need all their propaganda
[2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:29.120]  and all their lies and all their evil
[2:04:29.120 --> 2:04:31.120]  and all their cultural death
[2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:33.120]  they know we are strong.
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:35.120]  And they know in the end they sign it on
[2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:37.120]  the God of this world who is a loser.
[2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:39.120]  And that's why it's so important
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:41.120]  that everybody keep Infowars in the air now more than ever.
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:43.120]  Because even if you don't believe in God,
[2:04:43.120 --> 2:04:45.120]  what the globalists are manifesting
[2:04:45.120 --> 2:04:47.120]  and setting up is safe hand.
[2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:49.120]  And we are opposing the one world government
[2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:52.120]  and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[2:04:52.120 --> 2:04:54.120]  Two of our best selling products are back in stock.
[2:04:54.120 --> 2:04:56.120]  Then FullWarStore.com
[2:04:56.120 --> 2:04:58.120]  And they will sell out in the next 3-4 months
[2:04:58.120 --> 2:05:00.120]  before I get more of the product in
[2:05:00.120 --> 2:05:02.120]  if I sell it at full price.
[2:05:02.120 --> 2:05:04.120]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence
[2:05:04.120 --> 2:05:06.120]  about getting one or son or getting X3
[2:05:06.120 --> 2:05:08.120]  to try the products and see how amazing they are.
[2:05:08.120 --> 2:05:10.120]  And I believe you will then get hooked on them
[2:05:10.120 --> 2:05:12.120]  by myself, my family,
[2:05:12.120 --> 2:05:14.120]  by the way,
[2:05:14.120 --> 2:05:16.120]  by the way,
[2:05:16.120 --> 2:05:18.120]  by the way,
[2:05:18.120 --> 2:05:20.120]  by the way,
[2:05:20.120 --> 2:05:24.640]  hooked on them like myself and my family and the crew are. So again both these
[2:05:24.640 --> 2:05:30.200]  products are back in stock both X3 and Winter Sun they are 50% off for a
[2:05:30.200 --> 2:05:34.520]  limited time because they're going to sell out at this price I would estimate
[2:05:34.520 --> 2:05:39.400]  in less than a month. So this is your chance to get X3 and experience the
[2:05:39.400 --> 2:05:42.400]  good halogens versus the bad halogens. This is your chance to have the highest
[2:05:42.400 --> 2:05:46.400]  quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune system as well. They're
[2:05:46.400 --> 2:05:50.360]  amazing and they're an infowars store.com and the reason this is the 360 win is
[2:05:50.360 --> 2:05:55.520]  it funds the operation. I need funds to run the operation. You need to be healthy.
[2:05:55.520 --> 2:05:59.560]  We need to stay on air. It's a match made in heaven.
[2:05:59.560 --> 2:06:20.560]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:20.560 --> 2:06:29.720]  Well forever tactical or EVA tech is with us. I've been big fans of them for a
[2:06:29.720 --> 2:06:34.960]  long time and I've told listeners with supply chain breakdowns in the economy
[2:06:34.960 --> 2:06:38.320]  you seem like half the supplements that we've been selling for up to 10 years
[2:06:38.320 --> 2:06:42.600]  are just out of stock aren't available for the year and say discontinued on the
[2:06:42.600 --> 2:06:45.800]  site because we won't lower the quality they're going so I've been sitting around
[2:06:45.800 --> 2:06:50.560]  going well I haven't had sponsors in years because they harass and attack our
[2:06:50.560 --> 2:06:54.320]  old sponsors and threaten them but let me find folks that aren't scared and I
[2:06:54.320 --> 2:06:58.600]  bought stuff from these folks everybody I know loves them they've got high-end
[2:06:58.600 --> 2:07:05.000]  quality products that are 10 20% the cost of what major competitors are you
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:08.440]  try to buy a good double-edged dagger they're a hundred two hundred dollars
[2:07:08.440 --> 2:07:14.360]  this is same quality amazing and it's a fraction of the price they've got it all
[2:07:14.360 --> 2:07:19.120]  and they've got so much tactical gear all of it is so well made and so I'm just
[2:07:19.120 --> 2:07:25.160]  excited to have Drew Scholl on with us he's in Brisbane Australia on three
[2:07:25.160 --> 2:07:29.760]  acres with his dog and four chickens he started his company 2016 from his home
[2:07:29.760 --> 2:07:34.600]  office he's now has a team in Denver, Colorado and Florida future products
[2:07:34.600 --> 2:07:40.960]  from his great company the plan to release more high-end knives with s35 vn
[2:07:40.960 --> 2:07:45.720]  steel which is very high-end steel later this year they plan to launch a

[2:08:29.560 --> 2:08:33.680]  them because again I was like saying to the crew hey we got to find the
[2:08:33.680 --> 2:08:36.840]  operation we got to bring sponsorship back since the supplements aren't coming
[2:08:36.840 --> 2:08:40.200]  in anymore I thought I saw my problem ten years ago just having high quality
[2:08:40.200 --> 2:08:42.960]  supplements that's the whole foods biggest thing is supplements I mean
[2:08:42.960 --> 2:08:46.760]  people love them they work but because of the breakdowns I'm like well we better
[2:08:46.760 --> 2:08:52.400]  get a tactical gear outfit I love these folks I own one of their knives people I
[2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:56.320]  know love them they're patriots let's get them we called them boom they're on
[2:08:56.320 --> 2:09:00.400]  board their listeners they're great people so forever tactical folks
[2:09:00.400 --> 2:09:05.120]  evatacplus.com Drew thank you so much for joining us tell us about your great
[2:09:05.120 --> 2:09:12.200]  company and what you're doing yeah good day Alex how are you man I'm good I want
[2:09:12.200 --> 2:09:14.640]  to tell you about Australia what's been happening over there but that's another
[2:09:14.640 --> 2:09:20.520]  that's another show we'll have you on for that but wow yeah great company yeah
[2:09:20.520 --> 2:09:26.560]  yeah for sure so we started selling the products back in 2016 we started with
[2:09:26.560 --> 2:09:32.480]  the the combat bag which is this one this one here and that sold really well so
[2:09:32.480 --> 2:09:38.920]  then we've just expanded into knives and the dagger there that they you showed
[2:09:38.920 --> 2:09:46.760]  earlier and then we started heading over into firearm products and that's gone
[2:09:46.760 --> 2:09:53.000]  really well as well and in Australia so we can't sell in Australia we can't sell
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:57.920]  much of the firearm stuff or the spring assisted knives either so in Australia
[2:09:57.920 --> 2:10:03.160]  we're sort of moving more towards the sort of fitness tactical stuff however in
[2:10:03.160 --> 2:10:07.960]  in the States we're going to push further down the line of the of the knives
[2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:12.760]  and the firearm equipment so yeah towards the end of this year we've got a new
[2:10:12.760 --> 2:10:18.280]  holographic sight coming out and we've got some really nice S35V and knives
[2:10:18.280 --> 2:10:23.320]  coming out as well and that's a really good steel so that's really corrosion
[2:10:23.320 --> 2:10:28.840]  resistance and it doesn't it doesn't dull very easily either so they're a
[2:10:28.840 --> 2:10:33.800]  really really high quality knife well how do you how do you put out such high
[2:10:33.800 --> 2:10:38.320]  quality for such low prices because I've bought because I like them I've got five
[2:10:38.320 --> 2:10:41.400]  or six you know I got a Vietnam arrow and I paid like 800 bucks for this was
[2:10:41.400 --> 2:10:44.840]  from Vietnam and certified I bought some others like 200 bucks that are modern
[2:10:44.840 --> 2:10:50.400]  special forces knives I mean obviously for defending yourself this is the way
[2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:54.840]  to go in my opinion how can you guys show these for such a low price you know
[2:10:54.840 --> 2:10:58.680]  below thirty forty dollars when I know good and well that these are as good as
[2:10:58.680 --> 2:11:04.320]  $200 knives on the market yeah we buy in massive massive quantities so we've got
[2:11:04.320 --> 2:11:10.640]  a warehouse in Denver Colorado so they were buying knives in volumes of a
[2:11:10.640 --> 2:11:15.200]  hundred thousand two hundred thousand knives at a time which obviously makes
[2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:21.800]  our buy price ridiculously low and and then we are able to see freight them to
[2:11:21.800 --> 2:11:27.000]  Denver Colorado and then ship them directly to customers from there so
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:31.120]  we're not drop shipping or anything like that is coming straight from Denver
[2:11:31.120 --> 2:11:36.320]  and now our shipping time is really good as well so generally it's about five
[2:11:36.320 --> 2:11:42.320]  days shipping time it's been slightly bigger delays because of coronavirus but
[2:11:42.320 --> 2:11:46.640]  yeah it's actually pretty decent shipping times as well yeah cuz before we
[2:11:46.640 --> 2:11:49.720]  before we approach you as a sponsor already had some of the products I ordered
[2:11:49.720 --> 2:11:52.760]  some stuff and got it like a week everything else is broken down or
[2:11:52.760 --> 2:11:57.320]  falling apart just the logistical stuff you guys have done is amazing and again
[2:11:57.320 --> 2:12:02.160]  you've been around six seven years your footprint is exploding so I'm just glad
[2:12:02.160 --> 2:12:05.400]  when I contacted you guys that you stepped up and became sponsors I want to
[2:12:05.400 --> 2:12:08.840]  thank you because if you had decent stuff people should support you this is
[2:12:08.840 --> 2:12:14.520]  badass stuff at low prices people need to go there yeah yeah absolutely we put a
[2:12:14.520 --> 2:12:18.800]  lot of effort into it a lot of farm back and forth the factories to make sure
[2:12:18.800 --> 2:12:21.640]  the quality was there as well a lot of quality checks throughout the production
[2:12:21.640 --> 2:12:26.240]  process as well tell us about some of the products people are gonna find at
[2:12:26.240 --> 2:12:31.280]  evatecplus.com well that's the extended version of
[2:12:31.280 --> 2:12:40.200]  evatec.co so evatecplus.com that's got lots of other survival gear as well so

[2:12:43.600 --> 2:12:49.080]  lots of preparedness gear as well camping and hiking gear as well there so
[2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:53.120]  if you head over there and have a look at the prep preparedness category we've
[2:12:53.120 --> 2:12:57.640]  actually also got a category with all your favorite gear there as well and
[2:12:57.640 --> 2:13:04.520]  some family bundles so if if any of your your viewers want to buy a family

[2:13:08.960 --> 2:13:16.120]  once as well. I know for a fact that I paid $200 at a major sporting good
[2:13:16.120 --> 2:13:19.840]  store about a year ago for this same knife and I went and looked at them side
[2:13:19.840 --> 2:13:23.640]  by side I think you have the same manufacturer so I can get this for less
[2:13:23.640 --> 2:13:30.760]  than $40 from you the same knife or I can pay $200 at Cabela's hmm yeah
[2:13:30.760 --> 2:13:35.200]  absolutely yeah it's pretty crazy isn't it and I get it they got overhead they
[2:13:35.200 --> 2:13:38.400]  got to pay for a giant building but how much are you making on something like
[2:13:38.400 --> 2:13:43.440]  this you can't be making much I mean that that's a badass dagger no we're not

[2:24:32.520 --> 2:24:37.000]  offices in Florida and Colorado and you're you're sponsoring our show that
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:41.600]  is just beautiful because you know so many of the technical sites have some
[2:24:41.600 --> 2:24:44.800]  good products but a lot of crap what I've noticed is everything you've got is
[2:24:44.800 --> 2:24:51.560]  really kick-ass I think it's taken a bit of time to get there as well I mean you
[2:24:51.560 --> 2:24:55.280]  don't just go and get all this stock and every single one of them's a winner so
[2:24:55.280 --> 2:25:00.400]  if anything comes through that is not high enough quality basically we just
[2:25:00.400 --> 2:25:06.640]  de-list that and look for an alternative products so so I basically found you guys

[2:36:22.520 --> 2:36:26.680]  criminal and so nasty I'm not ready to reveal yet that it all it did was a lot
[2:36:26.680 --> 2:36:33.680]  of big-ass giant fire under my ass and you've got my infinity commitment to you

[2:36:55.480 --> 2:37:02.480]  cliff but isn't that the way this always works you only get pushed so far in this
[2:37:02.480 --> 2:37:09.320]  world so you start pushing back and I know you feel just like I do I can sense
[2:37:09.320 --> 2:37:14.880]  everything in you I know you because I know myself and I just want to commit to
[2:37:14.880 --> 2:37:20.720]  you I want to promise to you that we will beat these people and they will be
[2:37:20.720 --> 2:37:25.680]  broken and they will fail and they will be ground into dust but we don't do this
[2:37:25.680 --> 2:37:35.040]  because we hate them we do this because we love the children it's like those
[2:37:35.040 --> 2:37:38.720]  Ricardo bossy clips and he's the real soldier but all the world and former
[2:37:38.720 --> 2:37:43.320]  head of the Australian Special Forces and he's on television telling you we do
[2:37:43.320 --> 2:37:47.040]  not it fight back against these people because we hate them we do because we
[2:37:47.040 --> 2:37:51.320]  love our children we don't attack the enemy because we hate them though we
[2:37:51.320 --> 2:37:57.800]  hate them we do it because of those behind us and the strength of looking at
[2:37:57.800 --> 2:38:02.720]  your children and realizing that if you don't stand up for them nobody will is
[2:38:02.720 --> 2:38:10.000]  powerful and it's what God wants us to do and it's what we will do and we will
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:15.920]  win and we will not stop and it will be Bill Gates and it will be Lord Rothschild

[2:38:21.040 --> 2:38:27.000]  World Order that will be broken they will fail they will fall they will be
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:35.040]  destroyed not us oh some of us physically will be destroyed some of us will be
[2:38:35.040 --> 2:38:42.800]  tortured and killed because we are the answer to the evil we are the rescue
[2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:48.480]  team we are the cavalry my friends God sent the cavalry and it is us and we
[2:38:48.480 --> 2:38:55.720]  will do it and then we will experience the next level but Paul called the third
[2:38:55.720 --> 2:39:01.560]  heaven and nothing will keep us from that communion nothing will keep us from
[2:39:01.560 --> 2:39:10.960]  that event and where we're going and what we are part of together ignite the
[2:39:10.960 --> 2:39:17.920]  beacon ignite the will ignite the decision to fight evil and to become
[2:39:17.920 --> 2:39:22.600]  sanctified and purified sin the transmission and God will respond and
[2:39:22.600 --> 2:39:28.760]  God will send angels to guide us in our work because we are yet children who
[2:39:28.760 --> 2:39:37.320]  need a shepherd but we are children who will inherit the heavens we are children
[2:39:37.320 --> 2:39:44.080]  that hold the light of God in our hearts and souls but we don't keep that light
[2:39:44.080 --> 2:39:50.520]  for ourselves we give that light back to God in glory and in praise and we are
[2:39:50.520 --> 2:39:58.680]  resurrected you can feel how close God is now
[2:39:58.680 --> 2:40:08.760]  as nuclear war approaches will nuclear war happen that's up to God and us yes
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:14.400]  God can only move when we decide to move I mean God can move but God would then
[2:40:14.400 --> 2:40:22.320]  destroy our free will God could create endless planets and endless galaxies and
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:31.640]  endless universes of robots and servants to bow and fetch and scratch and follow
[2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:42.720]  orders but God is not seeking servants God is seeking communion God is seeking
[2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:52.200]  intercourse and not sexual intercourse psychic intercourse new beings new
[2:40:52.200 --> 2:40:57.960]  consciousness new art new ideas new creatures that have incredible potential
[2:40:57.960 --> 2:41:07.600]  that God can then watch and see God is lonely and we shouldn't let God down in
[2:41:07.600 --> 2:41:14.800]  this great quest we should thank God for the gift of consciousness and thank God
[2:41:14.800 --> 2:41:21.200]  for being the opposite of Satan do you think Satan would create independent
[2:41:21.200 --> 2:41:26.440]  sentient beings with a potential universe in them Satan couldn't do that
[2:41:26.440 --> 2:41:38.800]  number one and Satan wouldn't do that number two Satan wants slaves lost fools
[2:41:38.800 --> 2:41:49.720]  Satan is a loser a cosmic con artist a fraud God is real and that great animator
[2:41:49.720 --> 2:41:57.040]  of all matter and all time and all dimensions he's with us now and this
[2:41:57.040 --> 2:42:04.960]  test is a test for which God has tears of pain flowing down his cheeks but also
[2:42:04.960 --> 2:42:10.760]  tears of joy for those that will pass the test and move to the next level this
[2:42:10.760 --> 2:42:14.880]  is a big deal you're on a planet look around you all the beauty all of its

[2:42:20.360 --> 2:42:24.520]  decision to join him in eternity
[2:42:25.040 --> 2:42:33.240]  God is the groom we are the bride and together we will come together and build

[2:47:23.520 --> 2:47:30.320]  it comes to it will be hosting the fourth hour today ahead of Owen Shroyer and the
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:35.280]  war room and then I won't be doing a Saturday emergency transmission unless
[2:47:35.280 --> 2:47:39.360]  another war breaks out or something because I've got to get ready to go get
[2:47:39.360 --> 2:47:44.120]  on an airplane and get to where I'm about to have two big interviews next
[2:47:44.120 --> 2:47:50.520]  week really giant interviews believe me when I tell you that these are as big as
[2:47:50.520 --> 2:47:55.720]  they get and so look for that I would not be flying around the middle of a war
[2:47:55.720 --> 2:48:01.040]  if the interviews were not extremely important so Owen will be co-hosting
[2:48:01.040 --> 2:48:05.080]  Monday Tuesday Wednesday I'm back Wednesday afternoon and I'll be calling
[2:48:05.080 --> 2:48:09.160]  into the show and we'll be airing some of the big interviews you can see Trump's
[2:48:09.160 --> 2:48:13.040]  latest censored interview with full send that five million views just a few
[2:48:13.040 --> 2:48:16.040]  hours they took it down because they're not just there you know censoring
[2:48:16.040 --> 2:48:20.720]  Oliver Stone now this documentary from seven years ago about Ukraine they're
[2:48:20.720 --> 2:48:28.200]  now censoring of course podcasters that interview Trump it had five million views
[2:48:28.200 --> 2:48:31.520]  in a few hours it took it down off YouTube but banned by YouTube watch full
[2:48:31.520 --> 2:48:38.640]  send Trump podcast here or see the Trump interview banned from YouTube it's right
[2:48:38.640 --> 2:48:42.360]  there and it's powerful I mean I probably should just come on today and
[2:48:42.360 --> 2:48:47.880]  play play clips of that because he really explains a lot of things and I
[2:48:47.880 --> 2:48:51.440]  know Trump's a good guy like Trump overall don't like his endorsement of
[2:48:51.440 --> 2:48:54.960]  the vaccine but he's finally started to back off of that so that's very very
[2:48:54.960 --> 2:49:01.840]  exciting but let's look at some of the southern is teams driving to Mexico for
[2:49:01.840 --> 2:49:13.200]  cheaper gas I tried to dollar 19 less on average in Mexico because Mexico isn't
[2:49:13.200 --> 2:49:20.040]  turning the refineries or oil production off old Pemex is letting the
[2:49:20.040 --> 2:49:25.040]  Mexicans have their oil and so is the Russian oil companies but not here oh
[2:49:25.040 --> 2:49:29.920]  we're gonna show Putin by paying two three dollars more man that really
[2:49:29.920 --> 2:49:39.360]  shows him but hey this is what's really important Elon Musk at a very trendy
[2:49:39.360 --> 2:49:43.240]  idiotic looking girlfriend I gotta say one of the things I didn't like about
[2:49:43.240 --> 2:49:47.080]  Musk was his moron girlfriend and her comments about how communism is
[2:49:47.080 --> 2:49:54.000]  wonderful and stuff I mean some other rich idiot promoting communism but here
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:50:02.160]  it is she's dating Chelsea Manning Bradley Manning what was his name before he
[2:50:02.160 --> 2:50:07.960]  changed his name Bradley Manning so here's the deal Bradley Manning has
[2:50:07.960 --> 2:50:13.440]  showed up at events that we've put on around the country not 11 events you
[2:50:13.440 --> 2:50:17.920]  name it and just like oh it's joseph's transphobia no I don't care if a man
[2:50:17.920 --> 2:50:23.520]  says they want to be a woman I don't hate that whatever but I'm not supposed
[2:50:23.520 --> 2:50:28.600]  to bow down to you like oh my gosh you take hormone blockers and you say you're
[2:50:28.600 --> 2:50:33.760]  a woman you can have a baby no I'm not like oh my god you're the coolest kid
[2:50:33.760 --> 2:50:41.340]  in school let me bow down to you right now no and so man did Elon Musk make
[2:50:41.340 --> 2:50:46.200]  the right decision or what because that Adam's apple there that is amazing
[2:50:46.200 --> 2:50:51.280]  grimes dating whistleblower Chelsea Manning that were splitting with Elon
[2:50:51.280 --> 2:50:59.240]  Musk for second time and welping secret baby oh are two women gonna have a baby
[2:50:59.240 --> 2:51:05.200]  like in the California prisons where it says two women had a baby exactly did the
[2:51:05.200 --> 2:51:17.160]  woman oh my god it's immaculate conception did Chelsea Manning get did
[2:51:17.160 --> 2:51:25.840]  she no I know it's Elon's kid it's a joke did Chelsea Manning get grimes

[2:51:32.160 --> 2:51:40.960]  actually a Martian or it's a joke folks or is it grimes this baby with the other
[2:51:40.960 --> 2:51:50.400]  woman the Adam's apple person the man that's a woman but so there you go but
[2:51:50.400 --> 2:51:54.600]  hey let's let's just not worry about all that oh yeah can you guys cue this up
[2:51:54.600 --> 2:52:00.000]  they almost took up and they gave them a strike that's cue this up pull it in
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:05.080]  then pull it in you know I actually forgot to call Crowder back last night
[2:52:05.080 --> 2:52:11.280]  this morning they wanted me to do a Batman parody I got busy and I just
[2:52:11.280 --> 2:52:16.440]  remembered that I missed it they are such great comics and how fast they turn
[2:52:16.440 --> 2:52:21.400]  this out is just incredible so not name dropping here I'm just apologize to
[2:52:21.400 --> 2:52:25.680]  Stephen Crowder that I didn't get back with you about the Batman parody it
[2:52:25.680 --> 2:52:31.920]  needs to happen as soon as possible ladies and gentlemen but seriously look
[2:52:31.920 --> 2:52:40.080]  at these other headlines here who doesn't want to Bill Gates GMO insect to bite
[2:52:40.080 --> 2:52:44.760]  you I mean come on who doesn't want Bill Gates to have a programmed insect
[2:52:44.760 --> 2:52:50.800]  land on your arm or land on your back or land on your leg and in put a proboscis
[2:52:50.800 --> 2:52:56.040]  into your body and inject DNA into you I mean hell next you're gonna be against
[2:52:56.040 --> 2:53:01.320]  the Pfizer shot or the Moderna shot well that's what they've got going on
[2:53:01.320 --> 2:53:07.040]  scientists to release GMO mosquitoes funded by Gates Foundation in California
[2:53:07.040 --> 2:53:11.640]  and Florida millions of GMO mosquitoes funded by Bill and one of Gates
[2:53:11.640 --> 2:53:17.240]  Foundation are released in California and Florida according to reports wow let's
[2:53:17.240 --> 2:53:21.480]  hear about this so if he can't physically rape you he'll send out mosquitoes
[2:53:21.480 --> 2:53:28.480]  to do it the EPA green lit the release of GMO mosquitoes as part of a pilot
[2:53:28.480 --> 2:53:35.080]  program to crowd out natural mosquitoes in selected areas of two states of course
[2:53:35.080 --> 2:53:39.760]  they did this in Brazil and it caused a mutated mosquito that had even more
[2:53:39.760 --> 2:53:45.160]  toxic thing it passed on but that's okay Tim Cooks gay the mosquitoes were made
[2:53:45.160 --> 2:53:51.600]  by UK based biotechnology firm Oxitech which is funded by Bill and one of Gates
[2:53:51.600 --> 2:53:56.160]  an effort to combat insect-borne diseases such as denig fever yellow fever and
[2:53:56.160 --> 2:54:00.440]  Zika virus reported the epic times according to their company it's
[2:54:00.440 --> 2:54:05.280]  sustainable and targeted biological pest control technology does not harm
[2:54:05.280 --> 2:54:09.560]  beneficial insects like bees butterflies has proven to control the
[2:54:09.560 --> 2:54:16.240]  disease transmitting mosquito so there you go that's what matters Bill Gates
[2:54:16.240 --> 2:54:24.160]  doesn't want to rape you with his stainless steel proboscis he wants to do
[2:54:24.160 --> 2:54:29.520]  with a very friendly creature that's been programmed and prepared and readied
[2:54:29.520 --> 2:54:37.560]  for that since the day it was born in a big tank of water but again here is the
[2:54:37.560 --> 2:54:44.920]  censored clip that deals of all of this from the Crowder show here it is
[2:54:44.920 --> 2:54:55.400]  do not be afraid for the whole I bring you good tidings of great joy which

[2:55:30.600 --> 2:55:34.280]  stacks of news here and actually once I've already read it's very painful
[2:55:34.280 --> 2:55:44.120]  look at it again but let me just do that you see this stack this is the attack on
[2:55:44.120 --> 2:55:51.280]  children currently happening just the small amounts of information we got so
[2:55:51.280 --> 2:55:54.640]  let's look at it we got some good news Florida bill approves bill banning

[2:59:52.680 --> 3:00:05.200]  order it's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm your guest host
[3:00:05.200 --> 3:00:10.640]  Jay Dyer, jaysanalysis.com and today I thought what we would talk about would
[3:00:10.640 --> 3:00:16.480]  be the synthetic overlay of our reality that is given to us by the
[3:00:16.480 --> 3:00:22.640]  establishment by Hollywood by mass media so I'm gonna kind of go back to early
[3:00:22.640 --> 3:00:27.800]  days of Hollywood early days of the counterculture movie and music scene in
[3:00:27.800 --> 3:00:32.800]  the 50s 60s 70s take a look at a lot of surprising details that I'm sure you're
[3:00:32.800 --> 3:00:37.840]  probably not aware of and then move up into where we are now and see how we've
[3:00:37.840 --> 3:00:41.960]  been given basically a completely false overlay of how to interpret and read the
[3:00:41.960 --> 3:00:46.200]  world a false paradigm and so if we can see through this we'll actually have a
[3:00:46.200 --> 3:00:51.240]  clear way to understand the world will be we won't be duped by all these these
[3:00:51.240 --> 3:00:55.360]  tricks these tactics so let's go back to some of the fascinating aspects of
[3:00:55.360 --> 3:00:59.360]  Hollywood that you're probably not aware of did you know that the one of the
[3:00:59.360 --> 3:01:05.880]  most innovative and ahead of his time military studios was actually the cutting
[3:01:05.880 --> 3:01:12.280]  edge studio back in the 50s and 60s was called the Laurel Canyon it was excuse
[3:01:12.280 --> 3:01:17.440]  me as an Air Force studio in Laurel Canyon and this studio was known for
[3:01:17.440 --> 3:01:22.560]  example filming the atomic bomb footage now this was a secret highly
[3:01:22.560 --> 3:01:28.600]  classified access only by people like Walt Disney by the top directors and
[3:01:28.600 --> 3:01:33.200]  producers of that time and we don't even know all of the propaganda footage
[3:01:33.200 --> 3:01:37.320]  that the Laurel Canyon studios put out but what's interesting is that even back
[3:01:37.320 --> 3:01:42.240]  in this time in the 1950s there's a there's a intimate connection between
[3:01:42.240 --> 3:01:48.080]  the military industrial complex and the entertainment mega plexus of that time so
[3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:52.760]  Disney for example Walt had access to this studio famous actors of that time
[3:01:52.760 --> 3:01:57.320]  Jimmy Stewart Marilyn Monroe they all went to the Laurel Canyon studios and
[3:01:57.320 --> 3:02:01.320]  they would film again we don't even know what was filmed there in some instances
[3:02:01.320 --> 3:02:07.320]  we know they film as I said the the atomic bomb footage but they filmed all
[3:02:07.320 --> 3:02:12.320]  kinds of propaganda footage there as well there's movies that Jimmy Stewart
[3:02:12.320 --> 3:02:16.440]  did just for the Laurel Canyon Air Force studios now that was on to the guys of
[3:02:16.440 --> 3:02:22.240]  wartime right under under World War two and then in the Cold War and the point
[3:02:22.240 --> 3:02:26.120]  is that there's always been this intimate connection between the deep state
[3:02:26.120 --> 3:02:29.880]  military industrial complex the security state the shadow government and
[3:02:29.880 --> 3:02:34.920]  Hollywood and pop culture and as we walk through some of these facts that you're
[3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:38.480]  gonna see that it's actually a really intimate connection it's actually like
[3:02:38.480 --> 3:02:42.000]  the flip side of the two right Alex mentioned early on I think the first
[3:02:42.000 --> 3:02:46.440]  hour in flaming James Bond I've covered that you know for many many years it's
[3:02:46.440 --> 3:02:50.280]  in both of my books I cover the whole history of in flaming and James Bond and
[3:02:50.280 --> 3:02:55.080]  all of his wartime activities and how he wrote into his stories real operations
[3:02:55.080 --> 3:03:00.360]  real black ops real false flags or many of the James Bond novels and films deal
[3:03:00.360 --> 3:03:05.440]  with false flags which we see all the time in in our world in reality although
[3:03:05.440 --> 3:03:09.000]  still people don't really know what that is although now it's mainstream where
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:11.960]  there's no such thing as false flags but now there are false flags because the
[3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:15.720]  Russians might do it right that's what we were told what a month or so ago so
[3:03:15.720 --> 3:03:19.400]  we're gonna look here a little bit and an article that was written a few years
[3:03:19.400 --> 3:03:24.360]  ago dealing with 42 admitted false flags so I'm gonna pull that up here in a
[3:03:24.360 --> 3:03:28.640]  minute we'll look at that but going back to the history of Hollywood and
[3:03:28.640 --> 3:03:35.080]  wartime intelligence remember that excuse me Walt Disney was involved in on his
[3:03:35.080 --> 3:03:38.960]  own filming all kinds of propaganda videos for the deep state for the
[3:03:38.960 --> 3:03:44.200]  military industrial complex they filmed you can find videos of I guess Daffy
[3:03:44.200 --> 3:03:47.680]  duck or somebody telling you to pay your taxes right how important it is to
[3:03:47.680 --> 3:03:52.440]  Uncle Sam to pay your taxes to the IRS and so this that's because there's
[3:03:52.440 --> 3:03:55.560]  always this deep connection between Disney for example and the military
[3:03:55.560 --> 3:03:59.320]  industrial complex such that the CIA actually helped Disney get the land to
[3:03:59.320 --> 3:04:05.640]  set up Disney World in Florida a lot of people don't know that either but let's
[3:04:05.640 --> 3:04:08.920]  go back again even further you can go did you know that Houdini was actually a
[3:04:08.920 --> 3:04:14.120]  spy yes actually Houdini did intelligence work spying work secret
[3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:19.520]  service work at the same time as he did his his magic act and so at times his
[3:04:19.520 --> 3:04:26.840]  magic actually functioned as a cover for his espionage activities the many we'll
[3:04:26.840 --> 3:04:29.800]  find this as we get into this in the next segment many people in Hollywood
[3:04:29.800 --> 3:04:35.200]  many famous actors actually had a side gig of doing espionage work in spying you
[3:04:35.200 --> 3:04:39.680]  might have heard of Julia Childe right Julia Childe the famous TV cook she
[3:04:39.680 --> 3:04:43.400]  worked for the OSS and so we're gonna learn that the intelligence agencies have
[3:04:43.400 --> 3:04:49.160]  an intense interest in culture and culture creation and we're gonna see that
[3:04:49.160 --> 3:04:52.400]  when we look at the Laurel Canyon scene in the next segment don't go anywhere
[3:04:52.400 --> 3:04:56.960]  this is the Algae Jones show I'm your guest host J. Dyer of Jays and Alsace
[3:04:56.960 --> 3:05:03.480]  the globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical
[3:05:03.480 --> 3:05:09.800]  tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled they would then use that as the
[3:05:09.800 --> 3:05:14.920]  pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that
[3:05:14.920 --> 3:05:19.720]  speaks out against their lives because of so many scientists and engineers and
[3:05:19.720 --> 3:05:24.640]  researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers now their whole
[3:05:24.640 --> 3:05:30.040]  project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world
[3:05:30.040 --> 3:05:34.640]  government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[3:05:34.640 --> 3:05:38.560]  than ever the problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up
[3:05:38.560 --> 3:05:43.920]  on their takeover like Canada they've now declared a civil emergency and
[3:05:43.920 --> 3:05:48.200]  martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like
[3:05:48.200 --> 3:05:52.960]  Australia so pray for these folks big time it's a very serious situation and
[3:05:52.960 --> 3:05:58.400]  stay tuned in to info wars.com because truth is absolutely paramount
[3:06:04.040 --> 3:06:09.840]  I was going into that deep history of the shadow government the military
[3:06:09.840 --> 3:06:15.120]  industrial complex the intelligence deep state and their longtime connection with
[3:06:15.120 --> 3:06:21.160]  Hollywood with the music industry and with even organized crime and with pop
[3:06:21.160 --> 3:06:25.400]  culture and how they create culture because that's an important aspect for
[3:06:25.400 --> 3:06:29.200]  steering the culture so the intelligence agencies aren't just interested in these
[3:06:29.200 --> 3:06:34.320]  foreign operations with the stagecraft and whatnot and with spy craft they are
[3:06:34.320 --> 3:06:38.400]  but they're also interested in culture creation so for example in the Cold War
[3:06:38.400 --> 3:06:43.440]  we know that the CIA to combat the Soviet Empire they actually adopted a lot of
[3:06:43.440 --> 3:06:48.840]  postmodern styles of art they adopted the idea of creating degenerate art this is
[3:06:48.840 --> 3:06:52.760]  well known now it's declassified lots of mainstream articles in the I think the
[3:06:52.760 --> 3:06:57.760]  London Telegraph and so forth on this this fact that the CIA for example
[3:06:57.760 --> 3:07:01.920]  studied and understood that postmodern and deconstructionist types of
[3:07:01.920 --> 3:07:09.840]  literature and artwork had the effect of deracinating and basically
[3:07:09.840 --> 3:07:15.320]  destabilizing people when they immerse themselves in these kinds of artworks
[3:07:15.320 --> 3:07:21.120]  and so postmodernism was billed as a tool of freedom right the freedom of the
[3:07:21.120 --> 3:07:25.400]  West we're free in the West we're not stuck in the idea of objective
[3:07:25.400 --> 3:07:30.120]  structures and limitations and while there's a sense in which that's true
[3:07:30.120 --> 3:07:33.560]  yeah we believe in freedom freedom has to have a context that's of a worldview to
[3:07:33.560 --> 3:07:37.480]  give it meaning you can't just it's not like freedom is just this self-evident
[3:07:37.480 --> 3:07:42.800]  concept that doesn't come along with another you know with a worldview and so
[3:07:42.800 --> 3:07:46.760]  the CIA was able to understand and they actually brought over people from the
[3:07:46.760 --> 3:07:50.560]  Frankfurt School the Marxist the OSS was instrumental in bringing over
[3:07:50.560 --> 3:07:55.160]  Frankfurt School Marxists at the request of Bertrand Russell to help learn to
[3:07:55.160 --> 3:07:59.200]  weaponize the arts this is on record this is a well documented thing you give
[3:07:59.200 --> 3:08:02.560]  them you can even find high-level publications I think foreign affairs on
[3:08:02.560 --> 3:08:07.960]  how the OSS brought the Frankfurt School Marxist over to teach the CIA the OSS
[3:08:07.960 --> 3:08:12.680]  the nascent CIA at the time how to weaponize the arts to destroy cultures
[3:08:12.680 --> 3:08:18.760]  you understand that the arts are not just you know people being inspired to you
[3:08:18.760 --> 3:08:23.040]  know flop around on the stage and to hump the microphone like Jim Orrison or
[3:08:23.040 --> 3:08:25.800]  something like that right like that's that's that's something that is
[3:08:25.800 --> 3:08:31.960]  intentionally designed as a way to degrade culture I'm not saying that they
[3:08:31.960 --> 3:08:35.160]  put Jim Orrison up there although they could have because actually Jim Orrison's
[3:08:35.160 --> 3:08:39.760]  dad was Admiral Morrison who was behind the Gulf of Tonkin false flag attack
[3:08:39.760 --> 3:08:43.920]  that's actually true that's on record he was the Admiral in that very event the
[3:08:43.920 --> 3:08:46.360]  Gulf of Tonkin and that's one of the points I was gonna make about wait a
[3:08:46.360 --> 3:08:51.800]  minute the Laurel Canyon music scene which was actually the birth of the
[3:08:51.800 --> 3:08:56.720]  counterculture music scene it's actually a bunch of people who had these
[3:08:56.720 --> 3:09:02.040]  curious con connections to high-level military intelligence especially the
[3:09:02.040 --> 3:09:05.400]  families of the artists right having high-level military intelligence
[3:09:05.400 --> 3:09:09.080]  connections Jim Morrison being one of those classic examples and now I'm not
[3:09:09.080 --> 3:09:12.120]  saying that Jim Morrison was like a mind-controlled operative and that he
[3:09:12.120 --> 3:09:17.840]  didn't I think he was doing what he did of his own free will and volition but
[3:09:17.840 --> 3:09:22.440]  the point is that he was not this counterculture figure he was originally
[3:09:22.440 --> 3:09:26.240]  you can find pictures of him a few years before the doors got started just this
[3:09:26.240 --> 3:09:30.440]  like really clean-cut nerdy waspy dude right and he was probably I think was
[3:09:30.440 --> 3:09:33.560]  studying something innocuous like economics or something and then
[3:09:33.560 --> 3:09:38.840]  suddenly he becomes this you know free floating vagabond bohemian a sort of
[3:09:38.840 --> 3:09:42.320]  hippie dude that just sort of wandered around California like writing his
[3:09:42.320 --> 3:09:49.560]  poetry now it's curious because again his dad was a very high-level military
[3:09:49.560 --> 3:09:55.880]  establishment person involved in Gulf of Tonkin false flag operations and if it
[3:09:55.880 --> 3:09:59.520]  was only one instance that might be one thing but what we what we find is that
[3:09:59.520 --> 3:10:04.560]  so many families so many famous Hollywood people Hollywood royalty come from
[3:10:04.560 --> 3:10:09.040]  really high-level military and deep state intelligence families and I'm not
[3:10:09.040 --> 3:10:12.560]  trying to read too much into that it's just a kind of an analysis it's a pattern
[3:10:12.560 --> 3:10:17.600]  recognition that's there that we have to admit for example Frank Zappa Frank Zappa
[3:10:17.600 --> 3:10:22.400]  came from a family that was his father was famously involved in the production
[3:10:22.400 --> 3:10:29.080]  of chemical and biological warfare pathogens at the Edgewood arsenal so what
[3:10:29.080 --> 3:10:34.120]  this tells us is that you know Zappa's father was clearly involved in these
[3:10:34.120 --> 3:10:37.200]  high-level deep state projects and perhaps even something relating to M.
[3:10:37.200 --> 3:10:42.240]  K. ultra because M. K. ultra was very closely connected to the development of
[3:10:42.240 --> 3:10:46.960]  hallucinogens a really strong drugs for big pharma to be basically sell the
[3:10:46.960 --> 3:10:50.640]  populace on that's why everybody's on these Prozac and all these kinds of
[3:10:50.640 --> 3:10:54.960]  things is that this was at the behest of big pharma and big pharma was
[3:10:54.960 --> 3:11:00.520]  intimately connected to through sandals pharmaceuticals the emergence of LSD and
[3:11:00.520 --> 3:11:06.800]  in fact LSD was given out at the behest of the CIA in the counterculture like
[3:11:06.800 --> 3:11:11.080]  crazy right this was not something that was done accidentally that was actually
[3:11:11.080 --> 3:11:15.200]  promoted and there's many many instances of this of people who were known to be
[3:11:15.200 --> 3:11:19.280]  working with the CIA who were given permission to hand this stuff out most
[3:11:19.280 --> 3:11:24.560]  famously right Ken Keezy most famously Tim Leary and Larry himself says he's on
[3:11:24.560 --> 3:11:27.240]  record you can find the clip on YouTube where he says if you want to thank
[3:11:27.240 --> 3:11:32.000]  anybody for the 1960s counter-cultural revolution you need only thank the CIA
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:36.760]  and you said all I had to do to convince everybody to get into these to
[3:11:36.760 --> 3:11:39.920]  these drugs was to tell them that the government was keeping you from what's
[3:11:39.920 --> 3:11:45.800]  your right so he says I sold it as your right and thus everybody bought into it
[3:11:45.800 --> 3:11:52.760]  as an act of a revolution now as we progress through these counterculture
[3:11:52.760 --> 3:11:59.200]  figures we find this again as a really amazing actually recurring phenomena if
[3:11:59.200 --> 3:12:04.360]  we look at for example Papa John Phillips the momma's in the pop is he
[3:12:04.360 --> 3:12:09.840]  spent time in Cuba fighting for Castro and then stills comes up from across
[3:12:09.840 --> 3:12:14.200]  the stills and ass comes from a military family where he went and fought with the
[3:12:14.200 --> 3:12:18.240]  CIA special forces operation so here you have these counter-cultural figures who
[3:12:18.240 --> 3:12:25.520]  are also working with both Castro in the case of Phillips and with CIA special
[3:12:25.520 --> 3:12:30.520]  forces in the case of stills that's just curious to me that you that these
[3:12:30.520 --> 3:12:33.920]  figures who are these counterculture figures oh well they just happen to have
[3:12:33.920 --> 3:12:40.280]  right Vietnam high-level you know operations training and history we saw
[3:12:40.280 --> 3:12:43.640]  this with serial killers to remember in the case of many of the serial killers
[3:12:43.640 --> 3:12:48.960]  they were stationed in various places like in Germany and Vietnam and we saw
[3:12:48.960 --> 3:12:53.960]  that son of Sam right he had this Vietnam and he was actually by his
[3:12:53.960 --> 3:12:57.160]  lawyers they argued that he was part of the m-culture experiments and then after
[3:12:57.160 --> 3:13:02.440]  his experimentation with LSD he changed we saw that with Dahmer right when I
[3:13:02.440 --> 3:13:04.960]  covered this if you go over to my channel I have many lectures where I
[3:13:04.960 --> 3:13:08.120]  cover the history of serial killers and many of them being involved in these
[3:13:08.120 --> 3:13:14.000]  types of projects and perhaps even being trained as trained killers in what's
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:18.200]  called the Phoenix program now other examples would we could look as I said
[3:13:18.200 --> 3:13:23.040]  to the the case of Julia Childs she's the the first sort of TV celebrity chef
[3:13:23.040 --> 3:13:27.960]  and she just happens to be from have worked in the OSS right and you could
[3:13:27.960 --> 3:13:30.800]  say well but these people just learned a lot of skills when they were spies right
[3:13:30.800 --> 3:13:34.760]  I think it's more than that I think that the the intelligence agencies clearly
[3:13:34.760 --> 3:13:43.120]  have a desire and a role in culture creation so they didn't just want to you
[3:13:43.120 --> 3:13:46.520]  know send famous people over to spy on people that's probably well known right
[3:13:46.520 --> 3:13:51.760]  we all know about what the famous catcher is it Moe Berg he was a spy for
[3:13:51.760 --> 3:13:57.240]  the OSS there's the the famous case I think Jimmy Stewart did some spying
[3:13:57.240 --> 3:14:02.480]  espionage work for the FBI on the side people think that Kerry Grant spied for
[3:14:02.480 --> 3:14:06.920]  the OSS at times I think that's speculated I think he even tattled on
[3:14:06.920 --> 3:14:11.400]  Errol Flynn because Errol Flynn was thought to have been a fascist the
[3:14:11.400 --> 3:14:15.400]  Nazi spy there's many many cases of this Olga I think her name is Olga
[3:14:15.400 --> 3:14:19.520]  Chekova right she was the most famous actress in the in Germany and she's
[3:14:19.520 --> 3:14:23.840]  rumored to have been a Stalinist spy people believe that Coco Chanel right
[3:14:23.840 --> 3:14:28.960]  wasn't she rumored to be a spy for the for the Nazis as well this is a very
[3:14:28.960 --> 3:14:33.040]  well-known thing actually in the history of of Hollywood and acting going all the
[3:14:33.040 --> 3:14:37.640]  way back I think to the Elizabethan period there were famous Elizabethan
[3:14:37.640 --> 3:14:41.840]  actors and actresses who basically were court spies and if you think about it
[3:14:41.840 --> 3:14:45.360]  it makes perfect sense why would this be the case well it's because these people
[3:14:45.360 --> 3:14:50.120]  have access to places that other people don't they're invited to all over the
[3:14:50.120 --> 3:14:54.200]  world and then perhaps they might even be used in a in a honey trap operation
[3:14:54.200 --> 3:14:57.720]  maybe they're used to go sleep with somebody to get information on somebody
[3:14:57.720 --> 3:15:01.520]  we know this in the case of the the history of Time Like Magazine with Claire
[3:15:01.520 --> 3:15:05.000]  Booth-Loose and Henry Loose like Claire Booth-Loose was a spy she slept with a
[3:15:05.000 --> 3:15:09.720]  whole bunch of people in upper echelons of society and she was doing that for
[3:15:09.720 --> 3:15:14.440]  espionage reasons and they even make movies about this right I mean we know
[3:15:14.440 --> 3:15:17.600]  about this if you saw the movie Red Sparrow which was actually a bunch of
[3:15:17.600 --> 3:15:21.400]  anti-Russian propaganda but the movie Red Sparrow places Jennifer Lawrence in
[3:15:21.400 --> 3:15:24.860]  this role as a honey trap to go and sleep with prominent people to get
[3:15:24.860 --> 3:15:28.800]  information on them hey that's Epstein right we've all seen this with Epstein
[3:15:28.800 --> 3:15:33.200]  is this not the same type of thing where you have sex operatives doing things for
[3:15:33.200 --> 3:15:38.000]  high-level blackmail purposes so this is real-world stuff this really goes on and
[3:15:38.000 --> 3:15:41.960]  it connects to the world of Hollywood big time so when we come back we're gonna
[3:15:41.960 --> 3:15:45.600]  look at look at some more people some more prominent counterculture figures
[3:15:45.600 --> 3:15:51.600]  who just happen to have really high-level establishment connections and backing when
[3:15:51.600 --> 3:15:55.600]  we come back don't go anywhere this is the out-shown show I'm Jay Dyer
[3:15:56.600 --> 3:16:01.560]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart deep in my soul I've ever
[3:16:01.560 --> 3:16:08.280]  had in my 47 years on this planet I've had a lot of loss everybody else has and
[3:16:08.280 --> 3:16:16.840]  it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and
[3:16:16.840 --> 3:16:25.200]  died and bled and sweat for and now we're just throwing it all away I see the
[3:16:25.200 --> 3:16:29.320]  general public in a medically induced scientifically induced behavioral
[3:16:29.320 --> 3:16:35.840]  psychologically controlled tranqui and I know we're being fed into this global
[3:16:35.840 --> 3:16:41.960]  space around it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth and then
[3:16:41.960 --> 3:16:46.960]  growth and then falling apart and then degenerating collapsing and then coming
[3:16:46.960 --> 3:16:51.200]  back to life again it's just the globalist are actively trying to steer
[3:16:51.200 --> 3:16:55.440]  and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species
[3:16:55.440 --> 3:17:00.880]  as we know it it has been noted by many a historian the first casualty of war is
[3:17:00.880 --> 3:17:07.680]  the truth then the next big casualty isn't even the people that die no that
[3:17:07.680 --> 3:17:14.320]  is very follows but first there is the crackdown on populations basic liberty
[3:17:14.320 --> 3:17:19.720]  and speech and massive censorship and now across the world from the United
[3:17:19.720 --> 3:17:27.280]  States to Europe legislations being introduced that if you amplify any quote
[3:17:27.280 --> 3:17:33.720]  pro-russian information you can be censored you can be arrested you can be
[3:17:33.720 --> 3:17:38.280]  imprisoned and of course now Canada's under this legislation that if you have
[3:17:38.280 --> 3:17:44.120]  a thought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech
[3:17:44.120 --> 3:17:48.440]  online that you will be censored and arrested ladies and gentlemen the
[3:17:48.440 --> 3:17:52.600]  authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalist around the world against
[3:17:52.600 --> 3:17:56.680]  humanity that makes them fours dot com more important than ever the first
[3:17:56.680 --> 3:18:01.720]  ten amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791 the
[3:18:01.720 --> 3:18:05.960]  first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press
[3:18:05.960 --> 3:18:11.800]  free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship
[3:18:11.800 --> 3:18:17.920]  interference and restraint by the government 231 years later free speech
[3:18:17.920 --> 3:18:24.000]  across America is under chronic and insidious attack GCN is under attack

[3:18:54.400 --> 3:18:58.400]  Finnelli Mike in California thanks for calling I think we're barking up the
[3:18:58.400 --> 3:19:02.800]  wrong tree calling this gain of function research now if you read the actual
[3:19:02.800 --> 3:19:07.160]  you know 2014 legislation the US government gain of function deliberative
[3:19:07.160 --> 3:19:11.960]  process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research
[3:19:11.960 --> 3:19:15.960]  involving influenza MERS and stars virus there's nothing about czar's like
[3:19:15.960 --> 3:19:19.800]  viruses and if the research funding pause it's not a stop it's not a
[3:19:19.800 --> 3:19:23.360]  prohibition it's when you come to a four-way intersection there's the stops
[3:19:23.360 --> 3:19:27.360]  on you stop you look both ways and then you proceed and so it's also it doesn't
[3:19:27.360 --> 3:19:31.640]  pause all gain of function just selected gain of function but they'll argue that
[3:19:31.640 --> 3:19:36.120]  this is actually characterization and qualification research so you know Rand
[3:19:36.120 --> 3:19:39.080]  and others you know maybe Fauci was right they don't quite know what they're
[3:19:39.080 --> 3:19:41.800]  talking about calling it gain of function you know that's why he didn't
[3:19:41.800 --> 3:19:44.880]  perjure himself that's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally
[3:19:44.880 --> 3:19:48.840]  creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do but in the
[3:19:48.840 --> 3:19:52.560]  main definition it's still a gain of function they're making something deadly
[3:19:52.560 --> 3:19:56.720]  that spreads more easily to hurt people thank you Mike we love you
[3:19:56.720 --> 3:20:05.320]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[3:20:05.320 --> 3:20:18.320]  we were touching on the intimate deconnection between the intelligence apparatus
[3:20:18.320 --> 3:20:22.840]  the military industrial complex and the pop culture entertainment mind control
[3:20:22.840 --> 3:20:27.520]  complex and this partly by the way explains why so many of these pop stars
[3:20:27.520 --> 3:20:33.240]  do seem to you know elicit mind control type of behavior they act like they've
[3:20:33.240 --> 3:20:36.920]  been brainwashed not all the time sometimes it's you know just drugs or
[3:20:36.920 --> 3:20:40.720]  whatever but I think in a lot of cases these people do have a kind of role
[3:20:40.720 --> 3:20:45.840]  that they were raised to be these kind of controlled consumer products that are
[3:20:45.840 --> 3:20:51.640]  put out there to toxify the culture for example we've seen a lot of the pop
[3:20:51.640 --> 3:20:54.840]  stars that sort of go through this ritual process of being the good girl
[3:20:54.840 --> 3:20:58.560]  when they're young and then they turn into these it's the sort of Madonna
[3:20:58.560 --> 3:21:02.920]  horror complex right where they become these Babylon bitches basically by the
[3:21:02.920 --> 3:21:07.480]  time they they grow up there seems to be patterns like this there seems to be
[3:21:07.480 --> 3:21:13.000]  this process that the establishment engages in when they create these pop
[3:21:13.000 --> 3:21:16.640]  culture figures and a lot of these are creations now I'm not saying that the
[3:21:16.640 --> 3:21:21.200]  people don't have talent but I think in many cases they may not have talent but
[3:21:21.200 --> 3:21:26.040]  they may be put into these positions because of the money the power the mind
[3:21:26.040 --> 3:21:32.560]  control operations behind them and again this has been studied to you know the
[3:21:32.560 --> 3:21:35.720]  nth degree in terms of social engineering in terms of
[3:21:35.720 --> 3:21:39.720]  scientism and the mad scientist in the social industry to run our culture right
[3:21:39.720 --> 3:21:44.080]  they know how to do this stuff from a scientific perspective as we were
[3:21:44.080 --> 3:21:47.880]  progressing through that counterculture period we were looking at people like
[3:21:47.880 --> 3:21:53.600]  Zappa we were looking at Jim Morrison and the doors and Crosby stills and Nash
[3:21:53.600 --> 3:21:57.760]  the mamas and the poppas and there's other examples too there's a curious
[3:21:57.760 --> 3:22:01.000]  figure that many people may not be aware of who was kind of the pre Manson
[3:22:01.000 --> 3:22:04.440]  Manson his name is Vito Palikas and the reason that Vito is interesting is that
[3:22:04.440 --> 3:22:09.120]  he kind of becomes a model for a lot of the pop stars that developed their own
[3:22:09.120 --> 3:22:13.800]  cultists and if you think about Charles Manson he kind of was a cult leader who
[3:22:13.800 --> 3:22:19.960]  also developed a pop following right and that's precisely because as recent
[3:22:19.960 --> 3:22:22.840]  authors have kind of shown and demonstrated that which a lot of people
[3:22:22.840 --> 3:22:26.800]  know for a long time myself included that Manson was really a MK ultra CIA
[3:22:26.800 --> 3:22:30.840]  project as well I think he kind of went nuts obviously from all of this but
[3:22:30.840 --> 3:22:36.240]  there but prior to Manson there was this idea of the the Bohemian sort of
[3:22:36.240 --> 3:22:41.240]  wandering figure Vito Palikas who was out there and he was involved in
[3:22:41.240 --> 3:22:45.400]  pedo operations and this kind of stuff as well and he again he's sort of the
[3:22:45.400 --> 3:22:50.080]  model for Manson and this becomes kind of a thing that was repeated right you
[3:22:50.080 --> 3:22:54.520]  get more of these figures like Manson like these cult leaders that spring from
[3:22:54.520 --> 3:22:59.640]  the 60s counterculture or cultural revolution and it spills over into the
[3:22:59.640 --> 3:23:03.080]  serial killer realm I know that sounds kind of wild and out there but if you
[3:23:03.080 --> 3:23:07.000]  think about the Phoenix program which I'm right now I'm reading a gigantic book
[3:23:07.000 --> 3:23:10.000]  on that I'll be covering that soon from Douglas Valentine called the Phoenix
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:14.320]  program who was in Vietnam and wrote that book you can see how no actually
[3:23:14.320 --> 3:23:21.280]  there would be a motivation to cultivate create and control and steer serial
[3:23:21.280 --> 3:23:26.360]  killers and many of the serial killers have the same model of a Manson right
[3:23:26.360 --> 3:23:29.880]  they have that let me create a cult let me create a following I'm going to do
[3:23:29.880 --> 3:23:34.800]  these in a ritualistic way yeah there's Vito affecting nuts right and Vito is
[3:23:34.800 --> 3:23:38.360]  interesting because he would he gathered a following and he would just sort of
[3:23:38.360 --> 3:23:43.840]  wander around and he was many people think paid to attend the doors concerts
[3:23:43.840 --> 3:23:46.600]  right to actually give them the appearance of an audience I'm not saying
[3:23:46.600 --> 3:23:51.000]  the doors weren't good musicians but early on the doors were not very good and
[3:23:51.000 --> 3:23:54.200]  they couldn't really get an audience and so there were a lot of establishment
[3:23:54.200 --> 3:23:59.040]  connections behind the venues that were first premiering the doors another
[3:23:59.040 --> 3:24:04.440]  example this is the record companies at the time there were record companies
[3:24:04.440 --> 3:24:08.320]  that that jump I think was Columbia was the first to really jump on these 60s
[3:24:08.320 --> 3:24:15.000]  counterculture bands and just like the drug and mushroom phenomenon and the
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:20.200]  LSD phenomenon of the late 50s early 60s time magazine was really the first to
[3:24:20.200 --> 3:24:27.400]  give on its cover promotion of the drug hallucinogen counterculture they would
[3:24:27.400 --> 3:24:32.600]  they would premiere and give a promotion for that to to basically oh you know we
[3:24:32.600 --> 3:24:37.360]  fascinate people with this Columbia record starts to promote I forget the
[3:24:37.360 --> 3:24:41.920]  name there was a Turkish guy who was the owner of it at that time and he basically
[3:24:41.920 --> 3:24:47.440]  signed all these countercultural bands at the time and gave them basically a
[3:24:47.440 --> 3:24:50.880]  universal hearing right nobody would have heard of these bands until they were
[3:24:50.880 --> 3:24:55.120]  signed given time magazine attention the counterculture was given time magazine
[3:24:55.120 --> 3:24:59.440]  attention and why would that be again if there was not a an intentional
[3:24:59.440 --> 3:25:05.000]  motivation on the part of the CIA on the part of these these social engineers to
[3:25:05.000 --> 3:25:09.600]  push the counterculture and again even mainline books there's a book by a
[3:25:09.600 --> 3:25:13.120]  named J Stevens right he kind of touches on this called Storming Heaven where he
[3:25:13.120 --> 3:25:16.680]  wrote a mainline history of the counterculture and he kind of realized
[3:25:16.680 --> 3:25:20.120]  actually there they're kind of like promoting this on purpose he said whoa
[3:25:20.120 --> 3:25:24.240]  that was just to make money there the record company just wanted to make money
[3:25:24.240 --> 3:25:28.920]  it wasn't just about making money it was more than that it was culture creation
[3:25:28.920 --> 3:25:34.600]  and the writers later on historians like Francis Donor Saunders who wrote her
[3:25:34.600 --> 3:25:40.400]  big famous book CIA and the Cold War culture creation right about culture
[3:25:40.400 --> 3:25:44.320]  creation the Cold War I mean she reflected on this and went and documented
[3:25:44.320 --> 3:25:49.320]  how the CIA was actually funding all of these countercultural projects Jackson
[3:25:49.320 --> 3:25:54.360]  Pollock right Andy Warhol all these people were getting CIA money or money
[3:25:54.360 --> 3:25:59.000]  from CIA cutouts and this was all well it's under the Cold War for to promote
[3:25:59.000 --> 3:26:04.560]  freedom right and again I want to be nuanced here because I'm not saying
[3:26:04.560 --> 3:26:07.760]  that all of the bands are consciously participating in some sort of mind
[3:26:07.760 --> 3:26:10.840]  control project or they're all secretly working with the CIA a lot of people
[3:26:10.840 --> 3:26:13.960]  don't even know this right they're being co-opted into some given promotion being
[3:26:13.960 --> 3:26:20.560]  bought off given being given that next level a level status by people smarter
[3:26:20.560 --> 3:26:25.560]  than them and by their handlers right a lot of the actual musicians and artists
[3:26:25.560 --> 3:26:28.800]  I mean they're just kind of a you know handled by other people their manners or
[3:26:28.800 --> 3:26:32.160]  whatever and given drugs but they're just drugged out and controlled by their
[3:26:32.160 --> 3:26:35.760]  handlers they're not intentionally signing on to all these projects right
[3:26:35.760 --> 3:26:39.840]  there's more or less mind control and if we go back again to the 60s there's
[3:26:39.840 --> 3:26:44.640]  other people that that clearly have pretty astounding high-level connections
[3:26:44.640 --> 3:26:52.400]  Bruce Dern for example the famous actor in Hollywood royalty family his god
[3:26:52.400 --> 3:26:56.680]  parents included Franklin Eleanor Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt his
[3:26:56.680 --> 3:27:01.800]  grandfather was George Dern who was a secretary of war so here you have this
[3:27:01.800 --> 3:27:06.600]  seemingly counterculture figure who comes from the most establishment
[3:27:06.600 --> 3:27:09.560]  counterculture family I think one of his family members too was a high level
[3:27:09.560 --> 3:27:16.640]  skull and bones person it may have been George Dern the secretary of war you
[3:27:16.640 --> 3:27:22.520]  have the example excuse me as Bruce Dern's uncle that's who it is Archibald
[3:27:22.520 --> 3:27:28.240]  McLeish who was calling bones that's who I was thinking of again and the list goes
[3:27:28.240 --> 3:27:32.080]  on and on and on right yeah Dennis Hopper for example Dennis Hopper's dad
[3:27:32.080 --> 3:27:37.320]  also one of these key counterculture figures his father was in the OSS and I
[3:27:37.320 --> 3:27:41.440]  don't know if it's certain but there's rumors there's there's circumstantial
[3:27:41.440 --> 3:27:45.280]  evidence that Dennis Hopper was very interested in the occult very interested
[3:27:45.280 --> 3:27:49.360]  in Chroleanism and might have even been involved in some of the Chrolean OTO
[3:27:49.360 --> 3:27:54.040]  groups we know that David Carradine's father for example was actually a member
[3:27:54.040 --> 3:28:00.640]  of Crowley's OTO which is a you know more or less a satanic cult we know that
[3:28:00.640 --> 3:28:05.000]  the Sinatra's Frank Sinatra not only was he intimately connected to organized
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:09.840]  crime but the Sinatra's had a deep connection to both the FBI as an
[3:28:09.840 --> 3:28:16.700]  informant and to organized crime if you think about Alfred Wolstetter who's the
[3:28:16.700 --> 3:28:20.600]  famous Rand Corporation Illuminary for some reason he would have these meetings
[3:28:20.600 --> 3:28:24.880]  in the Laurel Canyon scene now why would one of the top people from the Rand
[3:28:24.880 --> 3:28:29.200]  Corporation this huge technocratic thing be having these regular meetings
[3:28:29.200 --> 3:28:32.600]  during the counterculture in Laurel Canyon with various people from that
[3:28:32.600 --> 3:28:37.680]  scene well my my suspicion is that now this is actually a promoted
[3:28:37.680 --> 3:28:41.640]  countercultural revolution right so when we come back we'll look at some more
[3:28:41.640 --> 3:28:46.280]  examples of connections between the deep state and pop culture this is the Alex
[3:28:46.280 --> 3:28:49.720]  Jones I want to remind you to go to the Info Wars store and support the Info

[3:31:32.320 --> 3:31:36.840]  after surgery studies have shown as for vitamin C and zinc themselves you

[3:31:44.560 --> 3:31:49.280]  that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations like here

[3:31:58.760 --> 3:32:05.080]  already into March 2022 and in the month of February we had a very popular
[3:32:05.080 --> 3:32:10.720]  sale that was going of our flagship product X3 that has all three types of
[3:32:10.720 --> 3:32:16.720]  the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity
[3:32:16.720 --> 3:32:21.720]  in your body your immune system your stamina your libido so much and the
[3:32:21.720 --> 3:32:26.080]  majority of the population the world is iodine deficient this is the very best
[3:32:26.080 --> 3:32:30.720]  iodine out there so we had on cell 50% off but we sold more than half of what we
[3:32:30.720 --> 3:32:35.120]  have or is it going to come in for a long time so I took it back to full
[3:32:35.120 --> 3:32:38.920]  process I was thinking you know what we need the funds in now to stand on air
[3:32:38.920 --> 3:32:43.680]  plus this is the right product everybody needs so to incentivize folks out there
[3:32:43.680 --> 3:32:46.960]  that have been on the fence get X3 and experience it yourself and support the
[3:32:46.960 --> 3:32:52.240]  broadcast I'm gonna keep it at 50% off until it sells out get X3 right now
[3:32:52.240 --> 3:32:59.640]  exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off leading a frontal assault on the
[3:32:59.640 --> 3:33:12.840]  lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones I was talking about before we
[3:33:12.840 --> 3:33:19.040]  laughed for that break that I just got my full calcium and I did and I love it
[3:33:19.040 --> 3:33:24.760]  and so my teeth are beautiful now previously they were not now they are
[3:33:24.760 --> 3:33:29.240]  beautiful and I was talking about Dennis Hopper I was talking about all those
[3:33:29.240 --> 3:33:32.880]  Laurel Canyon scene figures and I forgot to mention Dennis Hopper
[3:33:32.880 --> 3:33:37.880]  interestingly was had a role in a lot of those Kenneth Anger films you don't
[3:33:37.880 --> 3:33:41.080]  know who Kenneth Anger is he was one of these Crowley and avant-garde figures
[3:33:41.080 --> 3:33:45.800]  who also had a key role in the counterculture making those weird documentary
[3:33:45.800 --> 3:33:50.720]  or those weird films like Lucifer Rising with members of the Rolling Stones
[3:33:50.720 --> 3:33:55.760]  right playing in this in these dark sort of a cultic satanic films and as we
[3:33:55.760 --> 3:33:59.760]  said there's always been this kind of weird Crowley and Ethos to a lot of
[3:33:59.760 --> 3:34:03.840]  these Hollywood royalty people not all of them but many of them a lot of the
[3:34:03.840 --> 3:34:08.840]  Hollywood roll to families seem to have a very fascinating history with being
[3:34:08.840 --> 3:34:11.520]  connected to or interested in Crowleyism and then we've seen this with the pop
[3:34:11.520 --> 3:34:14.640]  stars as well right we've seen Jay-Z beyond say these different these
[3:34:14.640 --> 3:34:19.360]  different figures wearing Crowley t-shirts giving nods to Alistair Crowley and
[3:34:19.360 --> 3:34:24.280]  so yeah there is that satanic element for sure but also want to highlight the
[3:34:24.280 --> 3:34:28.160]  Crowley if you remember hit he was a an asset for British intelligence he did
[3:34:28.160 --> 3:34:34.600]  asset work for the people above in Fleming and that's actually detailed
[3:34:34.600 --> 3:34:39.120]  in multiple mainline history books in Fleming was involved in he didn't meet
[3:34:39.120 --> 3:34:42.160]  Crowley but he was involved in planning some of those operations that use
[3:34:42.160 --> 3:34:46.760]  Crowley to dupe the Nazis and so forth Crowley did asset work at the time of
[3:34:46.760 --> 3:34:52.480]  World War one as well so this is a key point to remember that the
[3:34:52.480 --> 3:34:58.320]  intelligence apparatus and the Hollywood pop scene and pop culture is
[3:34:58.320 --> 3:35:03.200]  intimately tied into satanic cults mind control cults and these always overlap
[3:35:03.200 --> 3:35:07.480]  that's the fascinating element here and why would we see this overlap well I
[3:35:07.480 --> 3:35:11.280]  think it has to do again yes you can look deeper into the spiritual components
[3:35:11.280 --> 3:35:14.840]  and how there's a higher level satanic element yeah and I've covered that many
[3:35:14.840 --> 3:35:18.760]  many times but I'm looking at it right now from the angle of social engineering
[3:35:18.760 --> 3:35:25.040]  right cults and mind control why would the CIA why would social engineers be
[3:35:25.040 --> 3:35:30.240]  interested in studying mind control well to control the population obviously so a
[3:35:30.240 --> 3:35:34.120]  lot of these cults which we've seen coming out of that counterculture coming
[3:35:34.120 --> 3:35:40.760]  out of the 60s and 70s Jim Jones Scientology they have intimate CIA and
[3:35:40.760 --> 3:35:46.200]  Mike and deep-sea connections precisely because they are experiments in many
[3:35:46.200 --> 3:35:49.480]  cases they are being studied they're being there was research going into how
[3:35:49.480 --> 3:35:57.320]  to mind control they're they're connected to mk ultra operations you see now
[3:35:57.320 --> 3:36:03.120]  let's take another example of a bizarre connection between the counterculture
[3:36:03.120 --> 3:36:08.400]  that comes out of Laurel Canyon and serial killers there's the case of the
[3:36:08.400 --> 3:36:13.600]  the Leonard Lake and Charles Ng the famous serial killer duo I think he was
[3:36:13.600 --> 3:36:16.280]  at one time originally he's called the unicorn killer because they the only
[3:36:16.280 --> 3:36:20.120]  picture they had of him was of him with the unicorn but he was connected to and
[3:36:20.120 --> 3:36:24.560]  and really close to a group of people who started the renaissance fair movement
[3:36:24.560 --> 3:36:28.920]  and that was started by a guy named Ron Patterson from the Laurel Canyon scene
[3:36:28.920 --> 3:36:34.040]  who was convicted pedophile and he's from the Laurel Canyon so this is like
[3:36:34.040 --> 3:36:38.080]  this hotbed right of the counterculture is Laurel Canyon it's not actually hate
[3:36:38.080 --> 3:36:41.960]  Ashbury hate Ashbury had its connection with the Grateful Dead who did have CIA
[3:36:41.960 --> 3:36:46.720]  connections as as we'll see here in a minute the way that we make that
[3:36:46.720 --> 3:36:50.720]  connection is through this figure called Stanley Owensley now Owensley was a
[3:36:50.720 --> 3:36:55.920]  formerly an Air Force intelligence operative who dealt with a lot of radio
[3:36:55.920 --> 3:37:02.440]  research RF research at that time but he was given four million she may he was
[3:37:02.440 --> 3:37:09.640]  given permission to give out four million LSD tabs during the 60s so at this
[3:37:09.640 --> 3:37:14.360]  time Owensley teamed up with the Grateful Dead to distribute these four million
[3:37:14.360 --> 3:37:19.440]  tabs and this is what helped really kick off that CIA and again that was in
[3:37:19.440 --> 3:37:24.240]  concert with Leary as well right so he's he's basically the one sort of
[3:37:24.240 --> 3:37:27.480]  promoting and creating all these he's known as the guy who basically gave
[3:37:27.480 --> 3:37:31.720]  everybody LSD and then Leary goes out and sort of promotes it on on a you
[3:37:31.720 --> 3:37:38.280]  know nationwide TV circuit and whatnot giving it out at the Ultima music
[3:37:38.280 --> 3:37:41.320]  festival in these different places where you have people tripping and losing
[3:37:41.320 --> 3:37:45.480]  their mind going crazy everybody knows about the Rolling Stones Ultima festival
[3:37:45.480 --> 3:37:49.200]  and the you know the Hell's Angels and people getting killed and whatnot and
[3:37:49.200 --> 3:37:52.480]  there's some really weird stuff with that as well right was that also some sort
[3:37:52.480 --> 3:37:58.000]  of a mind control experiment operation to have a ritual where people get killed
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:02.320]  at a mass concert as a mass ritual again think about astral world that we just
[3:38:02.320 --> 3:38:06.280]  covered a few months ago there's a long history of this people getting trampled
[3:38:06.280 --> 3:38:11.360]  and killed at concerts now the reason we want to look at Stanley Owensley was
[3:38:11.360 --> 3:38:16.360]  that he was also known for unleashing the drug called STP which was a bio
[3:38:16.360 --> 3:38:21.560]  warfare agent created where the Edward Arsenal so Edward Arsenal seems to figure
[3:38:21.560 --> 3:38:25.520]  you know continually in this Laurel Keynes the Laurel Kenyon scene stuff
[3:38:25.520 --> 3:38:32.000]  especially as we said with Frank Zappa's dad and so this this bizarre invention by
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:36.320]  Dow chemicals gets unleashed and then you have a bunch of chaos and havoc with
[3:38:36.320 --> 3:38:41.880]  that drug apparently also he had some connection and he worked with the JPL
[3:38:41.880 --> 3:38:46.800]  jet propulsion laboratory which was where none other than Jack Parsons
[3:38:46.800 --> 3:38:51.040]  worked and Jack Parsons was famously the inventor of the jet the jet propulsion
[3:38:51.040 --> 3:38:56.880]  engine and a famous Corlean he was a member of Crowley's OTO cult or if he
[3:38:56.880 --> 3:39:00.880]  was a member of the OTO and then Crowley went on to create his own Palema cult
[3:39:00.880 --> 3:39:04.520]  but for a while they were both in the same cult and they were there together
[3:39:04.520 --> 3:39:09.760]  with Elron Hubbard and there's the dispute over the Marjorie Cameron right
[3:39:09.760 --> 3:39:14.880]  between who would end up dating the Scarlett woman Marjorie Cameron either
[3:39:14.880 --> 3:39:20.960]  Elron Hubbard or Jack Parsons so in other words the whole sort of the 1950s
[3:39:20.960 --> 3:39:24.960]  and 60s rockets counterculture all of that has this Crowley and ethos behind it
[3:39:24.960 --> 3:39:29.120]  rock and roll has this Crowley and ethos behind it which is again something
[3:39:29.120 --> 3:39:33.200]  that you don't usually hear about in the mainstream so we were talking about
[3:39:33.200 --> 3:39:38.720]  other figures that come up Mark David Chapman right the the assassin in
[3:39:38.720 --> 3:39:44.960]  regard to John Lennon a lot of people don't know that Mark David Chapman went
[3:39:44.960 --> 3:39:52.080]  and gave a gift to bullets to Kenneth Anger and I think this is
[3:39:52.080 --> 3:39:55.520]  significant because what does it suggest in terms of the counterculture in
[3:39:55.520 --> 3:40:00.960]  terms of serial killers and Satanism coming out of the 1960s why would
[3:40:00.960 --> 3:40:05.200]  someone who is presumably I think involved in some kind of mind control
[3:40:05.200 --> 3:40:10.640]  assassin type of situation Mark David Chapman he goes and gifts Kenneth Anger
[3:40:10.640 --> 3:40:16.720]  this avant-garde satanic filmmaker bullets as if to say I did this as a ritual
[3:40:16.720 --> 3:40:20.160]  you know and I'm paying homage to you I'm not saying Kenneth Anger necessarily
[3:40:20.160 --> 3:40:24.000]  told Mark David Chapman to go kill John Lennon I'm just saying that there's
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:26.880]  something I think significant there and this is a this is a famous fact in
[3:40:26.880 --> 3:40:33.120]  history a lot of the figures who for example would start a pro-Americanist
[3:40:33.120 --> 3:40:38.000]  evangelical church known as the Calvary Chapel they also had curious
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:43.520]  Laurel Canyon CIA connections and this would be people from the band Buffalo
[3:40:43.520 --> 3:40:48.800]  Springfield forget that guy's name but one of the founding members of the band
[3:40:48.800 --> 3:40:53.840]  Buffalo Springfield would go on to found Calvary Chapel this would be also be
[3:40:53.840 --> 3:40:58.240]  connected to the Jesus people movement of the 60s which I'm not doubting that
[3:40:58.240 --> 3:41:02.000]  there weren't sincere people in the Jesus people movement but I think again in a
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:06.560]  lot of these types of things these sort of fuzzy cult-like movements you will
[3:41:06.560 --> 3:41:10.720]  find the intelligence apparatus there kind of in the background controlling
[3:41:10.720 --> 3:41:16.160]  things famously John Barrymore I think he's the
[3:41:16.160 --> 3:41:20.800]  grandfather of Drew Barrymore he was known to be a pretty nasty
[3:41:20.800 --> 3:41:24.480]  figure involved in various forms of perversion
[3:41:24.480 --> 3:41:27.760]  he had some bizarre connections and he actually played Sven Galli right this
[3:41:27.760 --> 3:41:32.800]  the weird mind control guy the spawn ranch where
[3:41:32.800 --> 3:41:38.240]  Manson was hanging out used to be a movie studio and it's curious to me that
[3:41:38.240 --> 3:41:42.000]  reportedly although nobody can prove this but there's there's long been rumors
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:46.320]  in Hollywood that what was actually being filmed at the spawn ranch was
[3:41:46.320 --> 3:41:50.080]  snuff films although again nobody knows for sure that's
[3:41:50.080 --> 3:41:53.600]  the case but there's also claims that very high
[3:41:53.600 --> 3:41:56.000]  level people perhaps even Marilyn Monroe were actually
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:41:59.600]  involved in you know pretty intense
[3:41:59.600 --> 3:42:02.800]  pornographic material that was being filmed at these different locations and
[3:42:02.800 --> 3:42:07.040]  that might actually also figure into the Manson killings think about George
[3:42:07.040 --> 3:42:11.120]  Hodel if you're familiar with this BFF with John Houston the famous
[3:42:11.120 --> 3:42:15.120]  director and how they were for a long time suspected
[3:42:15.120 --> 3:42:18.480]  and maybe many people today think that they were the key suspects in the Black
[3:42:18.480 --> 3:42:22.000]  Dahlia ritual murder and those are absolutely ritual murders especially if
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:25.760]  you look at the figure man Ray the famous surrealist
[3:42:25.760 --> 3:42:30.960]  artist many much of his surrealist art literally looks just like the way
[3:42:30.960 --> 3:42:34.400]  Elizabeth Short's body was ritually ritually murdered so there's always
[3:42:34.400 --> 3:42:38.320]  been again this deep connection between the satanic in Hollywood between
[3:42:38.320 --> 3:42:42.320]  mind control between intelligence agencies and again time magazine what does
[3:42:42.320 --> 3:42:46.080]  time magazine do at this time puts all of this on the front cover promoting
[3:42:46.080 --> 3:42:49.280]  mushrooms by magazine telling you go check out these mushrooms it's really
[3:42:49.280 --> 3:42:51.920]  cool it's fun when you come back we'll look at the
[3:42:51.920 --> 3:42:55.680]  final segment of some more connections between the deep state in Hollywood
[3:42:55.680 --> 3:42:59.600]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal
[3:42:59.600 --> 3:43:03.840]  for all our great info wars listeners and viewers if you will simply
[3:43:03.840 --> 3:43:08.480]  get x3 with all three types of good iodine that boosts your immune system
[3:43:08.480 --> 3:43:12.240]  and help everything that goes on your body at the cellular level

[3:43:23.120 --> 3:43:26.400]  halogen and then your purchase of x3
[3:43:26.400 --> 3:43:29.920]  funds our operation now a lot of our products have been sold out and never
[3:43:29.920 --> 3:43:33.200]  came back in because the lockdowns and supply chain breakdowns
[3:43:33.200 --> 3:43:37.280]  we were sold out of x3 for a long time and i had it on sale for 50 percent off
[3:43:37.280 --> 3:43:40.160]  a lot of folks were getting it and i was thinking you know what i'm going to
[3:43:40.160 --> 3:43:43.440]  bring it back on sale again just until it sells out
[3:43:43.440 --> 3:43:46.400]  because even though we won't make as much money in the long run a lot of folks
[3:43:46.400 --> 3:43:49.920]  need this product and we need to get the money from the sales in now to
[3:43:49.920 --> 3:43:56.640]  stay on air see your x3 right now at 50% off at infowarsstore.com
[3:43:56.640 --> 3:44:00.160]  it's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can
[3:44:00.160 --> 3:44:04.080]  decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere
[3:44:04.080 --> 3:44:07.200]  but if you look at all the different studies reports about my NASA and other
[3:44:07.200 --> 3:44:10.560]  governments other agencies they all disagree on what's really
[3:44:10.560 --> 3:44:13.360]  happening with the climate the only constant the only
[3:44:13.360 --> 3:44:17.520]  great truth is change is the only constant
[3:44:17.520 --> 3:44:22.000]  so yes climate change is totally real but notice first they called it global
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:25.360]  freezing back in the 70s 80s and then it's gonna be global warming and when
[3:44:25.360 --> 3:44:27.200]  that didn't really happen the way they wanted to
[3:44:27.200 --> 3:44:32.000]  okay now it's just climate change but did you know that man-made climate change
[3:44:32.000 --> 3:44:36.240]  is a real thing when it comes to the united nations and the department of
[3:44:36.240 --> 3:44:39.680]  energy and bill gates and the un they have weather
[3:44:39.680 --> 3:44:43.040]  control trees for 1979 and bill gates has been
[3:44:43.040 --> 3:44:47.280]  manipulating the weather for a very long time in fact back in 1994 two scientists
[3:44:47.280 --> 3:44:51.040]  won a Nobel prize for an idea of spring different particles out of jet engines
[3:44:51.040 --> 3:44:56.720]  to control the weather so yes man-made climate change is real
[3:44:56.720 --> 3:44:59.360]  two of our best selling products are back in stock
[3:44:59.360 --> 3:45:03.280]  infowarsstore.com and they will sell out in the next three four months before i
[3:45:03.280 --> 3:45:06.400]  get more of the product in if i sell it at full price
[3:45:06.400 --> 3:45:10.480]  but i want those of you that have been on the fence about getting one or sun
[3:45:10.480 --> 3:45:14.160]  or getting x3 to try the products and see how
[3:45:14.160 --> 3:45:17.760]  amazing they are and i believe he will then get hooked on them

[3:45:21.920 --> 3:45:25.520]  back in stock both x3 and one or sun they are

[3:47:07.360 --> 3:47:10.240]  one two one two three four
[3:47:14.880 --> 3:47:20.560]  the entire of jay's analysis of the alex jones show and i was just reminding you
[3:47:20.560 --> 3:47:24.480]  guys to uh go to the info war store again and
[3:47:24.480 --> 3:47:28.320]  support the info war by getting all of those excellent products that alex has
[3:47:28.320 --> 3:47:35.040]  i really am liking my world calcium now the toothpaste
[3:47:35.040 --> 3:47:38.720]  uh we were talking about a cult hollywood we were talking about the black
[3:47:38.720 --> 3:47:43.280]  dalya case and we were talking about how so many of these pop stars some of these
[3:47:43.280 --> 3:47:48.320]  elites in these circles seem to drift into really weird cults they drift into
[3:47:48.320 --> 3:47:51.680]  these mind control cults they drift into satanic cults
[3:47:51.680 --> 3:47:56.160]  uh even the more poppy versions of the satanic stuff like anton lobe right we
[3:47:56.160 --> 3:47:59.200]  see many many people sammy davis jr right famously
[3:47:59.200 --> 3:48:02.880]  was a member of the church of satan we've seen
[3:48:02.880 --> 3:48:07.760]  you know many prominent people in in the music scene being really into alistair
[3:48:07.760 --> 3:48:11.680]  crowley we saw we see the um led zeppelin right jimmy
[3:48:11.680 --> 3:48:15.520]  page robert plant right we see them having a fascination with
[3:48:15.520 --> 3:48:22.400]  proleanism even buying crowley's mansion in scott in uh or estate on the
[3:48:23.360 --> 3:48:26.960]  lake nessie or whatever it is i don't know what the name of the boluskeen is
[3:48:26.960 --> 3:48:30.560]  the is the estate but they're out there trying to find nessie i guess
[3:48:30.560 --> 3:48:34.480]  um but it doesn't stop there i mean we've seen
[3:48:34.480 --> 3:48:38.240]  the the occult the satanic the cabalism promoted
[3:48:38.240 --> 3:48:42.080]  by by countless pop stars and i don't think this is by example you think of
[3:48:42.080 --> 3:48:46.240]  david bowie right bowie's involved in um the golden dawn
[3:48:46.240 --> 3:48:49.920]  for a period as a fascination with that we think of ozzy osbourne and he's into
[3:48:49.920 --> 3:48:52.400]  crowley right and yes i understand that a lot of these
[3:48:52.400 --> 3:48:56.400]  people are not that sophisticated they may not even take it that seriously but
[3:48:56.400 --> 3:49:00.320]  there's something that's a pattern here where i think it's being promoted
[3:49:00.320 --> 3:49:04.480]  you know we have even more recently people like ariana grande right talking
[3:49:04.480 --> 3:49:08.240]  about oh i'm into the esoteric i'm into a cabala
[3:49:08.240 --> 3:49:12.400]  um madonna being into this stuff right the pop stars they go and they do
[3:49:12.400 --> 3:49:17.760]  they they're rituals up there at the vma's at the the super time
[3:49:17.760 --> 3:49:21.040]  haphal show right the the super bowl halftime show
[3:49:21.040 --> 3:49:24.560]  where they're doing these these mass rituals and again the point is really
[3:49:24.560 --> 3:49:29.280]  just to stress that this is not by accident i think beyond just the satanic
[3:49:29.280 --> 3:49:33.440]  side of it that's that higher level you know
[3:49:33.440 --> 3:49:37.280]  looking at it there's also the element of social engineering where from the
[3:49:37.280 --> 3:49:40.480]  vantage point of the social engineers they see the promotion of these things as
[3:49:40.480 --> 3:49:44.320]  a way to break down the society and the culture
[3:49:44.320 --> 3:49:48.320]  so it actually fits in with the cultural warfare
[3:49:48.320 --> 3:49:52.560]  in terms of depopulation right so it's just another way to
[3:49:52.560 --> 3:49:56.720]  atomize and destroy society for example um
[3:49:56.720 --> 3:50:01.200]  porn has been beamed into various countries as a form of warfare
[3:50:01.200 --> 3:50:04.880]  just like economics is a form of warfare right we talked in the past about
[3:50:04.880 --> 3:50:08.640]  soft power this is the way to exert influence in other countries through
[3:50:08.640 --> 3:50:12.720]  non-military means through money aid money through ngos through
[3:50:12.720 --> 3:50:18.400]  culture hollywood um i was mentioning other examples of connections in the
[3:50:18.400 --> 3:50:21.840]  music industry to the cia remember myles copeland
[3:50:21.840 --> 3:50:25.840]  right he's the relative of who stewart copeland the police
[3:50:25.840 --> 3:50:29.840]  it's just just so happens that stewart copeland is you know the relative of
[3:50:29.840 --> 3:50:33.520]  myles copeland the famous cia operative who wrote all of these books about the
[3:50:33.520 --> 3:50:36.720]  depopulation and how the cia was duping all these countries and
[3:50:36.720 --> 3:50:40.560]  i've done lectures on these all these books so you can go watch all my
[3:50:40.560 --> 3:50:44.480]  lectures with myles copeland going into great deeply he talks about how they
[3:50:44.480 --> 3:50:48.080]  go into in the book uh game of nations it's about syria
[3:50:48.080 --> 3:50:52.160]  he says we went into syria and we totally changed the country
[3:50:52.160 --> 3:50:55.360]  industrialized and so forth they're well that's isn't that good
[3:50:55.360 --> 3:50:58.160]  well they're being nice they're industrialized no he says at the end of
[3:50:58.160 --> 3:51:01.360]  the book that the purpose of the industrialization and modernizing of
[3:51:01.360 --> 3:51:06.080]  syria was so that in the long term they could depopulate it
[3:51:06.080 --> 3:51:10.800]  he says if you want to understand the cia operations in the middle east
[3:51:10.800 --> 3:51:13.680]  guess who he says to go read at the back of the book
[3:51:13.680 --> 3:51:18.240]  birch and russell go read birch and russell if you want to understand
[3:51:18.240 --> 3:51:21.600]  the long-term cia operations and you know what else he says in the book he
[3:51:21.600 --> 3:51:24.560]  says one of the key ways that we had an impact in
[3:51:24.560 --> 3:51:32.480]  hollywood eising syrian culture james bond yes he says we imported james bond
[3:51:32.480 --> 3:51:36.480]  movies and then they want i want to be like james bond i want to be like the
[3:51:36.480 --> 3:51:39.920]  hollywood guy it's a it's cultural warfare it's the manipulation of
[3:51:39.920 --> 3:51:46.880]  symbols and archetypes to change existing cultures to to to toxify them
[3:51:46.880 --> 3:51:51.040]  why so that you don't have offspring it's very simple
[3:51:51.040 --> 3:51:54.320]  that's it that's the main purpose and that's what myles copeland says the end
[3:51:54.320 --> 3:51:56.560]  of his book
[3:51:57.120 --> 3:52:01.520]  it's all these cults have the effect of not just being
[3:52:01.520 --> 3:52:04.960]  you know studied for mind control you know operations or whatever but they
[3:52:04.960 --> 3:52:09.760]  have the effect of of creating templates and ways for the establishment to use
[3:52:09.760 --> 3:52:12.560]  that information that they've studied with
[3:52:12.560 --> 3:52:16.080]  jim jones with scientology with manson or whoever
[3:52:16.080 --> 3:52:19.680]  to further perfect the technique of social control
[3:52:19.680 --> 3:52:24.640]  that's it so the principle behind why anyone would worship a cult leader is
[3:52:24.640 --> 3:52:28.480]  the exact same principle behind why anyone would follow a pop star
[3:52:28.480 --> 3:52:33.040]  it's the exact same modus operandi and it's studied
[3:52:33.040 --> 3:52:36.960]  on purpose to control society so all of these things are really just
[3:52:36.960 --> 3:52:40.560]  means and methods of control controlling the masses
[3:52:40.560 --> 3:52:44.880]  and it's just part of that process i think to gaslight by
[3:52:44.880 --> 3:52:48.320]  through ritual performances showing you this
[3:52:48.320 --> 3:52:51.680]  in plain shot in plain sight hidden in plain sight
[3:52:51.680 --> 3:52:56.720]  everyone's eyes are wide shut that's why they all go up and do rituals
[3:52:56.720 --> 3:53:02.320]  pink britney taylor swift lady gaga they're all they all do why do they all
[3:53:02.320 --> 3:53:04.800]  do the same thing how come nobody's doing something different
[3:53:04.800 --> 3:53:07.760]  why why isn't somebody doing wholesome songs
[3:53:07.760 --> 3:53:11.120]  well why isn't somebody doing uh i don't know their own artistic idea they
[3:53:11.120 --> 3:53:15.360]  all have to do these quasi misani satanic type of rituals why
[3:53:15.360 --> 3:53:19.760]  because there's a process there's a plan and they all are part of a
[3:53:19.760 --> 3:53:23.520]  the same structure and that same structure is the same structure that
[3:53:23.520 --> 3:53:28.400]  wants to impose the austerity the depopulation the
[3:53:28.400 --> 3:53:32.160]  destruction of the society
[3:53:32.320 --> 3:53:35.360]  remember uh when we were covering the astral world stuff
[3:53:35.360 --> 3:53:39.520]  remember there was a uh uh uh we mentioned the madonna song
[3:53:39.520 --> 3:53:42.880]  yeah there you go the the the suicide cult we're all jim jones now
[3:53:42.880 --> 3:53:46.720]  we're all in his kool-aid cult right and the kool-aid man
[3:53:46.720 --> 3:53:49.920]  is not going to bust through the wall and save anybody the kool-aid man's
[3:53:49.920 --> 3:53:52.960]  busting through the wall and it's actually jim jones and like he's giving
[3:53:52.960 --> 3:53:56.800]  everybody you know forties full of purple source
[3:53:56.800 --> 3:54:00.400]  wrecks and we're all dying yeah there's there's the
[3:54:00.400 --> 3:54:04.560]  woman riding the beast right they love that uh apocalyptic imagery
[3:54:04.560 --> 3:54:09.200]  now why was i saying all of that to get to what i wanted to go to something that
[3:54:09.200 --> 3:54:12.000]  seems a little bit different but actually it's connected false flags
[3:54:12.000 --> 3:54:15.840]  i want to read through a list of some of the admitted false flags because
[3:54:15.840 --> 3:54:21.280]  false flags are stagecraft applied to the warfare domain to dupe
[3:54:21.280 --> 3:54:24.480]  everybody into thinking oh they're the bad guys
[3:54:24.480 --> 3:54:29.600]  right to get along to get in on a war remember uh jim morrison's dad
[3:54:29.600 --> 3:54:33.600]  admiral morrison was who was manning the ship when they had the
[3:54:33.600 --> 3:54:37.360]  false flag gulf of tonkin incident that's a false flag
[3:54:37.360 --> 3:54:41.360]  on record and there's many many of these there's a great article
[3:54:41.360 --> 3:54:46.640]  this is from i think washington's blog governments around the world admit to
[3:54:46.640 --> 3:54:51.440]  staging false flags the first one here it says japanese troops set up a small
[3:54:51.440 --> 3:54:55.520]  explosion on a train in 1951 and falsely blamed it on china in
[3:54:55.520 --> 3:55:00.400]  order to justify the invasion of manchuria so that was again one of the
[3:55:00.400 --> 3:55:04.880]  famous false flag a major in the nazi ss admitted at
[3:55:04.880 --> 3:55:10.400]  nuremberg trials that under oath they engaged in multiple instances of
[3:55:10.400 --> 3:55:14.240]  false flags in regard to justifying the invasion of poland
[3:55:14.240 --> 3:55:17.360]  so it's not something that one person does or one government does it's done by
[3:55:17.360 --> 3:55:19.520]  many many governments i don't know if i'll be able to get through all of these
[3:55:19.520 --> 3:55:23.920]  in the last this segment but um ron's halder uh
[3:55:23.920 --> 3:55:27.920]  under nuremberg trials testified that leader herman
[3:55:27.920 --> 3:55:32.800]  herman gurring admitted to setting fire to the german parliament in 19
[3:55:32.800 --> 3:55:38.880]  1933 i barely read that uh to blame it on the
[3:55:38.880 --> 3:55:42.080]  communists and everybody knows about the right stag
[3:55:42.080 --> 3:55:47.200]  soviet leader nikita khrushchev admitted to the soviet union's red army
[3:55:47.200 --> 3:55:50.880]  shelled a russian village in manila in 1959 and blamed it on
[3:55:50.880 --> 3:55:54.560]  finland russian parliament russian president
[3:55:54.560 --> 3:55:59.440]  putin this one mentions the soviet leader gorbachev
[3:55:59.440 --> 3:56:06.400]  admitted that stallin ordered his secret police to execute 22 000
[3:56:06.400 --> 3:56:09.360]  polish army officers and falsely blamed it on
[3:56:09.360 --> 3:56:13.840]  nazis the british government admits that between 1946 and 1948 it bombed five
[3:56:13.840 --> 3:56:17.600]  ships carrying jews attempting to flee
[3:56:17.600 --> 3:56:21.360]  during world war two to find safety at palestine and they blamed it on
[3:56:21.360 --> 3:56:25.440]  defenders of arab palestine so that was actually the british impart doing that
[3:56:25.440 --> 3:56:29.120]  um israel admits that in 1954 israeli terrorists
[3:56:29.120 --> 3:56:33.440]  uh operating in egypt planted bombs in order to
[3:56:33.440 --> 3:56:38.560]  blame it on egyptians 19 the cia admits in 1950 that they posed as
[3:56:38.560 --> 3:56:42.160]  communists and staged bombings uh under democratically
[3:56:42.160 --> 3:56:46.480]  democratically elected prime minister in iran
[3:56:46.480 --> 3:56:50.400]  oh yeah everybody knows about that mozadek thing uh turkish prime minister
[3:56:50.400 --> 3:56:54.240]  admitted that the turkish government carried out false flags in 1955
[3:56:54.240 --> 3:56:57.840]  uh in terms of their battle with greece
[3:56:57.840 --> 3:57:00.880]  british prime minister admitted that uh there was
[3:57:00.880 --> 3:57:04.240]  false flags in 1957 the british i'm just going through these really quicker to
[3:57:04.240 --> 3:57:06.960]  get to so anyway there's there's many many of the dozens and doesn't this
[3:57:06.960 --> 3:57:09.840]  this is not a comprehensive list there's many more i don't even think this
[3:57:09.840 --> 3:57:14.480]  list doesn't even mention on 11 right um so but the point is that when you go
[3:57:14.480 --> 3:57:17.920]  through this list dozens of them you'll notice that this is really
[3:57:17.920 --> 3:57:21.280]  stagecraft applied to warfare and i'm not saying that there's not real bombings
[3:57:21.280 --> 3:57:24.480]  that people don't get killed in many cases they do sometimes it's totally fake
[3:57:24.480 --> 3:57:28.880]  but in some cases it's a staged bombing in the sense of it's a bombing that
[3:57:28.880 --> 3:57:32.960]  was really done and blamed on an enemy and if this is just mainstream history
[3:57:32.960 --> 3:57:36.880]  what i learned in my college class is why are we surprised that we're often
[3:57:36.880 --> 3:57:40.960]  duped by a false synthetic overlay which we were
[3:57:40.960 --> 3:57:45.120]  programmed for through hollywood
[3:57:47.280 --> 3:57:51.680]  i stay on air selling high quality products that you need
[3:57:51.680 --> 3:57:55.280]  that you want and that you're going to be happy with that's why you come back
[3:57:55.280 --> 3:57:59.120]  and buy products from me again it's a symbiotic relationship i promote
[3:57:59.120 --> 3:58:02.160]  liberty i promote freedom i fight the globalist
[3:58:02.160 --> 3:58:05.520]  and i'm able to do that because you buy products and then foreshore.com
[3:58:05.520 --> 3:58:08.880]  and listen all the products are great but when it comes to high quality
[3:58:08.880 --> 3:58:13.440]  storeable food in an inflationary system with major supply chain
[3:58:13.440 --> 3:58:18.080]  breakdowns this is an absolute 360 win a no-brainer and

[3:58:43.520 --> 3:58:48.480]  to go up because inflation is exploding the purpose of fear is to call us into
[3:58:48.480 --> 3:58:51.680]  action and there is plenty to be afraid of today
[3:58:51.680 --> 3:58:54.720]  half the population has lined up for an untested
[3:58:54.720 --> 3:58:58.560]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be
[3:58:58.560 --> 3:59:01.680]  afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease
[3:59:01.680 --> 3:59:04.720]  the perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal
[3:59:04.720 --> 3:59:09.040]  of having 80 of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence
[3:59:09.040 --> 3:59:13.440]  hive mind in less than nine years for those of us who have awoken from the
[3:59:13.440 --> 3:59:15.840]  spell we know this is all really happening
[3:59:15.840 --> 3:59:20.960]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things to do
[3:59:20.960 --> 3:59:24.080]  we continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game
[3:59:24.080 --> 3:59:27.440]  if enough people awaken from the cold spell then we win
[3:59:27.440 --> 3:59:31.360]  but even when we win and we eventually will the days of convenience
[3:59:31.360 --> 3:59:35.760]  are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare get up to a years worth of
[3:59:35.760 --> 3:59:39.680]  storeable foods water filtration survival gear
[3:59:39.680 --> 3:59:43.600]  seeds shortwave radios and lifesaving knowledge
